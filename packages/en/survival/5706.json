I fear there is more of the matter of hard\r\nscience and of scientific speculation in this collection than of\r\nspiritual and aesthetic nutriment; but I do hope the volume is not\r\nentirely destitute of the latter. If I have not in some degree\r\nsucceeded in transmuting my rocks into a kind of wholesome literary\r\nbread, or, to vary the figure, in turning them into a soil in which\r\nsome green thing or flower of human interest and emotion may take\r\nroot and grow, then, indeed, have I come short of the end I had in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that my own interest in geology far outruns my\r\nknowledge, but if I can in some degree kindle that interest in my\r\nreader, I shall be putting him on the road to a fuller knowledge\r\nthan I possess. As with other phases of nature, I have probably\r\nloved the rocks more than I have studied them. In my youth I\r\ndelighted in lingering about and beneath the ledges of my native\r\nhills, partly in the spirit of adventure and a boy's love of the\r\nwild, and partly with an eye to their curious forms, and the\r\nevidences of immense time that looked out from their gray and\r\ncrumbling fronts. I was in the presence of Geologic Time, and was\r\nimpressed by the scarred and lichen-coated veteran without knowing\r\nwho or what he was. But he put a spell upon me that has deepened as\r\nthe years have passed, and now my boyhood ledges are more\r\ninteresting to me than ever.\r\n\r\nIf one gains an interest in the history of the earth, he is quite\r\nsure to gain an interest in the history of the life on the earth. If\r\nthe former illustrates the theory of development, so must the\r\nlatter. The geologist is pretty sure to be an evolutionist. As\r\nscience turns over the leaves of the great rocky volume, it sees the\r\nimprint of animals and plants upon them and it traces their changes\r\nand the appearance of new species from age to age. The biologic tree\r\nhas grown and developed as the geologic soil in which it is rooted\r\nhas deepened and ripened. I am sure I was an evolutionist in the\r\nabstract, or by the quality and complexion of my mind, before I read\r\nDarwin, but to become an evolutionist in the concrete, and accept\r\nthe doctrine of the animal origin of man, has not for me been an\r\neasy matter.\r\n\r\nThe essays on the subject in this volume are the outcome of the\r\nstages of brooding and thinking which I have gone through in\r\naccepting this doctrine. I am aware that there is much repetition in\r\nthem, but maybe on that very account they will help my reader to go\r\nalong with me over the long road we have to travel to reach this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nJuly, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Surely a long journey, stretching through\r\nimmeasurable epochs of geologic time, and attended by vicissitudes\r\nof which we can form but feeble conceptions.\r\n\r\nThe majority of readers, I fancy, are not yet ready to admit that\r\nthey, or any of their forebears, have ever made such a journey. We\r\nhave all long been taught that our race was started upon its career\r\nonly a few thousand years ago, started, not amid the warrings of\r\nsavage elemental nature, but in a pleasant garden with everything\r\nneeded close at hand. This belief has faded a good deal in our time,\r\nespecially among thoughtful persons; but in a modified form, as the\r\nspecial creation theory, it held sway in the minds of the older\r\nnaturalists like Agassiz and Dawson, long after Darwin had launched\r\nhis revolutionary doctrine of our animal origin, putting man in the\r\nsame zoological scheme as the lower orders.\r\n\r\nWe are slow to adjust our minds to the revelations of science, they\r\nhave been so long adjusted to a revelation, so-called, of an\r\nentirely different character. It gives them a wrench more or less\r\nviolent when we try to make them at home and at their ease amid\r\nthese new and startling disclosures. To many good people evolution\r\nseems an ungodly doctrine, like setting up a remorseless logic in\r\nthe place of an omnipresent Creator. But there is no help for it.\r\nScience has fairly turned us out of our comfortable little\r\nanthropomorphic notion of things into the great out-of-doors of the\r\nuniverse. We must and will get used to the chill, yea, to the cosmic\r\nchill, if need be. Our religious instincts will be all the hardier\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nWhen we accepted Newton's discovery of the force called gravitation,\r\nwe virtually surrendered ourselves to the enemy, and started upon a\r\nroad, the road of natural causation, that traverses the whole system\r\nof created things. We cannot turn back; we may lie down by the\r\nroadside and dream our old dreams, but our children and their\r\nchildren will press on, and will be exhilarated by the journey.\r\n\r\nIt is at first sight an unpalatable truth that evolution confronts\r\nus with, and it requires courage calmly to face it. But it is in\r\nperfect keeping with the whole career of physical science, which is\r\nforever directing our attention to common near-at-hand facts for the\r\nkey to remote and mysterious occurrences.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that evolution adds greatly to the wonder of life,\r\nbecause it takes it out of the realm of the arbitrary, the\r\nexceptional, and links it to the sequence of natural causation. That\r\nman should have been brought into existence by the fiat of an\r\nomnipotent power is less an occasion for wonder than that he should\r\nhave worked his way up from the lower non-human forms. That the\r\nmanward impulse should never have been lost in all the appalling\r\nvicissitudes of geologic time, that it should have pushed steadily\r\non, through mollusk and fish and amphibian and reptile, through\r\nswimming and creeping and climbing things, and that the forms that\r\nconveyed it should have escaped the devouring monsters of the earth,\r\nsea, and air till it came to its full estate in a human being, is\r\nthe wonder of wonders.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, evolution raises immensely the value of the\r\nbiological processes that are everywhere operative about us, by\r\nshowing us that these processes are the channels through which the\r\ncreative energy has worked, and is still working. Not in the far-off\r\nor in the exceptional does it seek the key to man's origin, but in\r\nthe sleepless activity of the creative force, which has been pushing\r\nonward and upward, from the remotest time, till it has come to full\r\nfruition in man.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to inject into man's natural history a supernatural\r\nelement, as nearly all biologists and anthropologists before\r\nDarwin's time did, and as many serious people still do. It is too\r\neasy, in fact, and the temptation to do so is great. It makes short\r\nwork of the problem of man's origin, and saves a deal of trouble.\r\nBut this method is more and more discredited, and the younger\r\nbiologists and natural philosophers accept the zoological\r\nconception of man, which links him with all the lower forms, and\r\nproceed to work from that.\r\n\r\nWhen we have taken the first step in trying to solve the problem of\r\nman's origin, where can we stop? Can we find any point in his\r\nhistory where we can say, Here his natural history ends, and his\r\nsupernatural history begins? Does his natural history end with the\r\npre-glacial man, with the cave man, or the river-drift man, with the\r\nlow-browed, long-jawed fossil man of Java,--Pithecanthropus erectus,\r\ndescribed by Du Bois? Where shall we stop on his trail? I had almost\r\nsaid \"step on his tail,\" for we undoubtedly, if we go back far\r\nenough, come to a time when man had a tail. Every unborn child at a\r\ncertain stage of its development still has a tail, as it also has a\r\ncoat of hair and a hand-like foot. But could we stop with the tailed\r\nman--the manlike ape, or the apelike man? Did his Creator start him\r\nwith this appendage, or was it a later suffix of his own invention?\r\n\r\nIf we once seriously undertake to solve the riddle of man's origin,\r\nand go back along the line of his descent, I doubt if we can find\r\nthe point, or the form, where the natural is supplanted by the\r\nsupernatural as it is called, where causation ends and miracle\r\nbegins. Even the first dawn of protozoic life in the primordial seas\r\nmust have been natural, or it would not have occurred,--must have\r\nbeen potential in what went before it. In this universe, so far as\r\nwe know it, one thing springs from another; the sequence of cause\r\nand effect is continuous and inviolable.\r\n\r\nWe know that no man is born of full stature, with his hat and boots\r\non; we know that he grows from an infant, and we know the infant\r\ngrows from a fetus, and that the fetus grows from a bit of nucleated\r\nprotoplasm in the mother's womb. Why may not the race of man grow\r\nfrom a like simple beginning? It seems to be the order of nature; it\r\nIS the order of nature,--first the germ, the inception, then the\r\nslow growth from the simple to the complex. It is the order of our\r\nown thoughts, our own arts, our own civilization, our own language.\r\n\r\nIn our candid moments we acknowledge the animal in ourselves and in\r\nour neighbors,--especially in our neighbors,--the beast, the shark,\r\nthe hog, the sloth, the fox, the monkey; but to accept the notion of\r\nour animal origin, that gives us pause. To believe that our remote\r\nancestor, no matter how remote in time or space, was a lowly\r\norganized creature living in the primordial seas with no more brains\r\nthan a shovel-nosed shark or a gar-pike, puts our scientific faith\r\nto severe test.\r\n\r\nThink of it. For countless ages, millions upon millions of years, we\r\nsee the earth swarming with life, low bestial life, devouring and\r\ndevoured, myriads of forms, all in bondage to nature or natural\r\nforces, living only to eat and to breed, localized, dependent upon\r\nplace and clime, shaped to specific ends like machines,--to fly, to\r\nswim, to climb, to run, to dig, to drill, to weave, to wade, to\r\ngraze, to crush,--knowing not what they do, as void of conscious\r\npurpose as the thorns, the stings, the hooks, the coils, and the\r\nwings in the vegetable world, making no impression upon the face of\r\nnature, as much a part of it as the trees and the stones, species\r\nafter species having its day, and then passing off the stage, when\r\nsuddenly, in the day before yesterday in the geologic year, so\r\nsuddenly as to give some color of truth to the special creation\r\ntheory, a new and strange animal appears, with new and strange\r\npowers, separated from the others by what appears an impassable\r\ngulf, less specialized in his bodily powers than the others, but\r\nvastly more specialized in his brain and mental powers, instituting\r\na new order of things upon the earth, the face of which he in time\r\nchanges through his new gift of reason, inventing tools and weapons\r\nand language, harnessing the physical forces to his own ends, and\r\nputting all things under his feet,--man the wonder-worker, the\r\nbeholder of the stars, the critic and spectator of creation itself,\r\nthe thinker of the thoughts of God, the worshiper, the devotee, the\r\nhero, spreading rapidly over the earth, and developing with\r\nprodigious strides when once fairly launched upon his career. Can it\r\nbe possible, we ask, that this god was fathered by the low bestial\r\norders below him,--instinct giving birth to reason, animal ferocity\r\ndeveloping into human benevolence, the slums of nature sending forth\r\nthe ruler of the earth. It is a hard proposition, I say, undoubtedly\r\nthe hardest that science has ever confronted us with.\r\n\r\nHaeckel, discussing this subject, suggests that it is the parvenu in\r\nus that is reluctant to own our lowly progenitors, the pride of\r\nfamily and position, like that of would-be aristocratic sons who\r\nconceal the humble origin of their parents. But it is more than\r\nthat; it is the old difficulty of walking by faith where there is\r\nnothing visible to walk upon: we lack faith in the efficiency of the\r\nbiologic laws, or any mundane forces, to bridge the tremendous chasm\r\nthat separates man from even the highest of the lower orders. His\r\nradical unlikeness to all the forms below him, as if he moved in a\r\nworld apart, into which they could never enter, as in a sense he\r\ndoes, is where the difficulty lies. Moreover, evolution balks us\r\nbecause of the inconceivable stretch of time during which it has\r\nbeen at work. It is as impossible for us to grasp geological time as\r\nsidereal space. All the standards of measurement furnished us by\r\nexperience are as inadequate as is a child's cup to measure the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nSeveral million years, or one million years,--how can we take it in?\r\nWe cannot. A hundred years is a long time in human history, and how\r\nwe pause before a thousand! Then think of ten thousand, of fifty\r\nthousand, of one hundred thousand, of ten hundred thousand, or one\r\nmillion, or of one hundred million! What might not the slow but\r\nceaseless creative energy do in that time, changing but a hair in\r\neach generation! If our millionaires had to earn their wealth cent\r\nby cent, and carry each cent home with them at night, it would be\r\nsome years before they became millionaires. This is but a faint\r\nsymbol of the slow process by which nature has piled up her riches.\r\nShe has had no visions of sudden wealth. To clothe the earth with\r\nsoil made from the disintegrated mountains--can we figure that time\r\nto ourselves? The Orientals try to get a hint of eternity by saying\r\nthat when the Himalayas have been ground to powder by allowing a\r\ngauze veil to float against them once in a thousand years, eternity\r\nwill only have just begun. Our mountains have been pulverized by a\r\nprocess almost as slow. In our case the gauze veil is the air, and\r\nthe rains, and the snows, before which even granite crumbles. See\r\nwhat the god of erosion, in the shape of water, has done in the\r\nriver valleys and gorges--cut a mile deep in the Colorado canyon,\r\nand yet this canyon is but of yesterday in geologic time. Only give\r\nthe evolutionary god time enough and all these miracles are surely\r\nwrought.\r\n\r\nTruly it is hard for us to realize what a part time has played in\r\nthe earth's history,--just time, duration,--so slowly, oh, so\r\nslowly, have the great changes been brought about! The turning of\r\nmud and silt into rock in the bottom of the old seas seems to have\r\nbeen merely a question of time. Mud does not become rock in man's\r\ntime, nor vegetable matter become coal. These processes are too slow\r\nfor us. The flexing and folding of the rocky strata, miles deep,\r\nunder an even pressure, is only a question of time. Allow time\r\nenough and force enough, and a layer of granite may be bent like a\r\nbow. The crystals of the rock seem to adjust themselves to the\r\nstrain, and to take up new positions, just as they do, much more\r\nrapidly, in a cake of ice under pressure. Probably no human agency\r\ncould flex a stratum of rock, because there is not time enough, even\r\nif there were power enough. \"A low temperature acting gradually,\"\r\nsays my geology, \"during an indefinite age would produce results\r\nthat could not be otherwise brought about even through greater\r\nheat.\" \"Give us time,\" say the great mechanical forces, \"and we will\r\nshow you the immobile rocks and your rigid mountain chains as\r\nflexible as a piece of leather.\" \"Give us time,\" say the dews and\r\nthe rains and the snowflakes, \"and we will make you a garden out of\r\nthose same stubborn rocks and frowning ledges.\" \"Give us time,\" says\r\nLife, starting with her protozoans in the old Cambrian seas, \"and I\r\nwill not stop till I have peopled the earth with myriad forms and\r\ncrowned them all with man.\"\r\n\r\nDana thinks that had \"a man been living during the changes that\r\nproduced the coal, he would not have suspected their progress,\" so\r\nslow and quiet were they. It is probable that parts of our own\r\nsea-coast are sinking and other parts rising as rapidly as the\r\noscillation of the land and sea went on that resulted in the laying\r\ndown of the coal measures.\r\n\r\nAn eternity to man is but a day in the cosmic process. In the face\r\nof geologic time, man's appearance upon the earth as man, with a\r\nwritten history, is something that has just happened; it was in this\r\nmorning's paper, we read of it at breakfast. As evolution goes, it\r\nwill not be old news yet for a hundred thousand years or so, and by\r\nthat time, what will he have done, if he goes on at his present rate\r\nof accelerated speed? Probably he will not have caught the gods of\r\nevolution at their work, or witnessed the origin of species by\r\nnatural descent, these things are too slow for him; but he will\r\ncertainly have found out many things that we are all eager to know.\r\n\r\nIn nature as a whole we see results and not processes. We see the\r\nrock strata bent and folded, we see the whole mountain-chains flexed\r\nand shortened by the flexure; but had we been present, we should not\r\nhave suspected what was going on. Our little span of life does not\r\ngive us the parallax necessary. The rock strata, miles thick, may be\r\nbeing flexed now under our feet, and we know it not. The earth is\r\nshrinking, but so slowly! When, under the slow strain, the strata\r\nsuddenly give way or sink, and an earthquake results, then we know\r\nsomething has happened.\r\n\r\nA recent biologist and physicist thinks, and doubtless thinks\r\nwisely, that the reason why we have never been able to produce\r\nliving from non-living matter in our laboratories, is that we cannot\r\ntake time enough. Even if we could bring about the conditions of the\r\nearly geologic ages in which life had its dawn, which of course we\r\ncannot, we could not produce life because we have not geologic time\r\nat our disposal.\r\n\r\nThe reaction which we call life was probably as much a cosmic or\r\ngeologic event as were the reactions which produced the different\r\nelements and compounds, and demanded the same slow gestation in the\r\nwomb of time. During what cycles upon cycles the great mother-forces\r\nof the universe must have brooded over the inorganic before the\r\norganic was brought forth! The archean age, during which the\r\nbrooding seems to have gone on, was probably as long as all the ages\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nHow we are baffled when we talk about the beginning of anything in\r\nnature or in our own lives! In our experience there must be a first,\r\nbut when did manhood begin; when did puberty, when did old age,\r\nbegin? When did each stage of our mental growth begin? When or where\r\ndid the English language begin, or the French, or the German? Was\r\nthere a first English word spoken? From the first animal sound, if\r\nwe can conceive of such, up to the human speech of to-day, there is\r\nan infinite gradation of sounds and words.\r\n\r\nWas there a first summer, a first winter, a first spring? There\r\ncould hardly have been a first day even for ages and ages, but only\r\nslowly approximating day. After an immense lapse of time the air\r\nmust have cleared and the day become separated from the night, and\r\nthe seasons must have become gradually defined. Things slowly emerge\r\none after another from a dim, nebulous condition, both in our own\r\ngrowth and experience and in the development of the physical\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nIn nature there is no first and last. There is an endless beginning\r\nand an endless ending. There was no first man or first woman, no\r\nfirst bird, or fish, or reptile. Back of each one stretches an\r\nendless chain of approximating men and birds and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThis talk about the time and place where man began his existence\r\nseems to me misleading, because it appears to convey the idea that\r\nhe began as man at some time, in some place. Whereas he grew. He\r\nbegan where and when the first cell appeared, and he has been on the\r\nroad ever since. There is no point in the line where he emerged from\r\nthe not-man and became man. He was emerging from the not-man for\r\nmillions of years, and when you put your finger on an animal form\r\nand say, This is man, you must go back through whole geologic\r\nperiods before you reach the not-man. If Darwin is right, there is\r\nno more reason for believing that the different species or forms of\r\nanimal life were suddenly introduced than there is for believing\r\nthat the soil, or the minerals, gold, silver, diamonds, or vegetable\r\nmold and verdure were suddenly introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we know anything of the earth's past history, we know that the\r\ncontinents were long in forming, that they passed through many\r\nvicissitudes of heat and cold, of fire and flood, of upheaval and\r\nsubsidence--that they had, so to speak, their first low, simple\r\nrudimentary or invertebrate life, that they were all slow in getting\r\ntheir backbones, slower still in clothing their rock ribs with soil\r\nand verdure, that they passed through a sort of amphibian stage, now\r\nunder water, now on dry land, that their many kinds of soils and\r\nclimes were not differentiated and their complex water-systems\r\nestablished till well into Tertiary times--in short, that they have\r\npassed more and more from the simple to the complex, from the\r\ndisorganized to the organized. When man comes to draw his sustenance\r\nfrom their breasts, may they not be said to have reached the\r\nmammalian stage?\r\n\r\nThe fertile plain and valley and the rounded hill are of slow\r\ngrowth, immensely slow. But any given stage of the earth has\r\nfollowed naturally from the previous stage, only more and more and\r\nhigher and higher forces took a hand in the game. First its elements\r\npassed through the stage of fire, then through the stage of water,\r\nthen merged into the stage of air. More and more the aerial\r\nelements--oxygen, carbon, nitrogen--have entered into its\r\nconstituents and fattened the soil. The humanizing of the earth has\r\nbeen largely a process of oxidation. More than disintegrated rock\r\nmakes up the soil; the air and the rains and the snows have all\r\ncontributed a share.\r\n\r\nThe history of the soil which we turn with our spade, and stamp with\r\nour shoes, covers millions upon millions of years. It is the ashes\r\nof the mountains, the leavings of untold generations of animal and\r\nvegetable life. It came out of the sea, it drifted from the heavens;\r\nit flowed out from the fiery heart of the globe; it has been worked\r\nover and over by frost and flood, blown by winds, shoveled by ice,\r\n--mixed and kneaded and moulded as the house-wife kneads and moulds\r\nher bread,--refining and refining from age to age. Much of it was\r\nheld in solution in the primordial seas, whence it was filtered and\r\nused and precipitated by countless forms of marine life, making a\r\nsediment that in time became rocks, that again in time became\r\ncontinents or parts of them, which the aerial forces reduced to\r\nsoil. Indeed, the soil itself is an evolution, as much so as the\r\nlife upon it.\r\n\r\nWe probably have little conception of how intimate and cooperative\r\nall parts of the universe are with one another,--of the debt we owe\r\nto the farthest stars, and to the remotest period of time. We must\r\nowe a debt to the monsters of Mesozoic and Caenozoic time; they\r\nhelped to fertilize the soil for us, and to discipline the ruder\r\nforces of life. We owe a debt to all that has gone before: to the\r\nheavens above and to the earth-fires beneath, to the ice-sheets that\r\nground down the mountains, and to the ocean currents. Just as we owe\r\na debt to the men and women in our line of descent, so we owe a debt\r\nto the ruder primordial forces that shaped the planet to our use,\r\nand took a hand in the game of animal life.\r\n\r\nThe gods of evolution had served a long apprenticeship; they had\r\ngained proficiency and were master workmen. Or shall we say that the\r\nelements of life had become more plastic and adaptable, or that the\r\nlife fund had accumulated, so to speak? Had the vast succession of\r\nliving beings, the long experience in organization, at last made the\r\nproblem of the origin of man easier to solve?\r\n\r\nOne fancies every living thing as not only returning its mineral\r\nelements to the soil, but as in some subtle way leaving its vital\r\nforces also, and thus contributing to the impalpable, invisible\r\nstore-house of vital energy of the globe.\r\n\r\nAt first among the mammalian tribes there was much muscle and little\r\nbrains. But in the middle Tertiary the mammal brain began suddenly\r\nto enlarge, so that in our time the brain of the horse is more than\r\neight times the size of the brain of his progenitor, the dinoceras\r\nof Eocene times.\r\n\r\nNature seems to have experimented with brains and nerve ganglia, as\r\nshe has with so many other things. The huge reptilian creatures of\r\nMesozoic time--the various dinosaurs--had ridiculously small heads\r\nand brains, but they had what might be called supplementary brains\r\nwell toward the other end of the body,--great nervous masses near\r\nthe sacrum, many times the size of the ostensible brain, which no\r\ndoubt performed certain brain functions. But the principle of\r\ncentralization was at work, and when in later time we reach the\r\nhigher mammalian forms, we find these outlying nervous masses called\r\nin, so to speak, and concentrated in the head.\r\n\r\nNature has tried the big, the gigantic, over and over, and then\r\nabandoned it. In Carboniferous times there was a gigantic\r\ndragon-fly, measuring more than two feet in the expanse of wings.\r\nStill earlier, there were gigantic mollusks and sea scorpions, a\r\ncephalopod larger than a man; then gigantic fishes and amphibians\r\nand reptiles, followed by enormous mammals. But the geologic record\r\nshows that these huge forms did not continue. The mollusks that last\r\nunchanged through millions of years are the clam and the oyster of\r\nour day. The huge mosses and tree-ferns are gone, and only their\r\nhumbler types remain. Among men giants are short-lived.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the steady increase in size of certain other\r\nspecies of animals during the later geologic ages is a curious and\r\ninteresting fact. The first progenitors of the elephant that have\r\nbeen found show a small animal that steadily grew through the ages\r\ntill the animal as we now find it is reached. Among the\r\ninvertebrates this same progressive increase in size has been noted,\r\na small shell in the Devonian becoming enormous in the Triassic.\r\nCertain species of sharks of medium size in the lower Eocene\r\ncontinue to increase till they attain the astounding dimensions in\r\nthe Miocene and Pliocene of over one hundred feet long. A certain\r\nfish appearing in the Devonian as a small fish of seven centimetres\r\nin length, becomes in the Carboniferous era a creature twenty-seven\r\ncentimetres in length. Among the mammals of Tertiary times this same\r\nlaw of steady increase in size has been operative, as seen in the\r\nFelidae, the stag, and the antelope. Man himself has, no doubt, been\r\nunder the same law, and is probably a much larger animal than any of\r\nhis Tertiary ancestors. In the vegetable world this process, in many\r\ncases, at least, has been reversed, and the huge treelike\r\nclub-mosses and horsetails of Carboniferous times have dwindled in\r\nour time to very insignificant herbaceous forms.\r\n\r\nAnimals of overweening size are handicapped in many ways, so that\r\nnature in most cases finally abandons the gigantic and sticks to the\r\nmedium and the small.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan we fail to see the significance of the order in which life has\r\nappeared upon the globe--the ascending series from the simple to the\r\nmore and more complex? Can we doubt that each series is the outcome\r\nof the one below it--that there is a logical sequence from the\r\nprotozoa up through the invertebrates, the vertebrates, to man? Is\r\nit not like all that we know of the method of nature? Could we\r\nsubstitute the life of one period for that of another without doing\r\nobvious violence to the logic of nature? Is there no fundamental\r\nreason for the gradation we behold?\r\n\r\nAll animal life lowest in organization is earliest in time, and vice\r\nversa, the different classes of a sub-kingdom, and the different\r\norders of a class, succeeding one another, as Cope says, in the\r\nrelative order of their zoological rank. Thus the sponges are later\r\nthan the protozoa, the corals succeed the sponges, the sea-urchins\r\ncome after the corals, the shell-fish follow the sea-urchins, the\r\narticulates are later than the shell-fish, the vertebrates are later\r\nthan the articulates. Among the former, the amphibian follows the\r\nfish, the reptile follows the amphibian, the mammal follows the\r\nreptile, and non-placental mammals are followed by the placental.\r\n\r\nIt almost seems as if nature hesitated whether to produce the mammal\r\nfrom the reptile or from the amphibian, as the mammal bears marks of\r\nboth in its anatomy, and which was the parent stem is still a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe heart started as a simple tube in the Leptocardii; it divides\r\nitself into two cavities in the fishes, into three in the reptiles,\r\nand into four in the birds and mammals. So the ossification of the\r\nvertebral column takes place progressively, from the Silurian to the\r\nmiddle Jurassic.\r\n\r\nThe same ascending series of creation as a whole is repeated in the\r\ninception and development of every one of the higher animals to-day.\r\nEach one begins as a single cell, which soon becomes a congeries of\r\ncells, which is followed by congeries of congeries of cells, till\r\nthe highly complex structure of the grown animal with all its\r\nintricate physiological activities and specialization of parts, is\r\nreached. It is typical of the course of the creative energy from the\r\nfirst unicellular life up to man, each succeeding stage flowing out\r\nof, and necessitated by, the preceding stage.\r\n\r\nHow slowly and surely the circulatory system improved! From the\r\ncold-blooded animal to the warm-blooded is a great advance. In the\r\nwarm-blooded is developed the capacity to maintain a fixed\r\ntemperature while that of the surrounding medium changes. The brain\r\nand nervous system display the same progressive ascent from the\r\nbrainless acrania, up through the fishes, batrachia, reptiles, and\r\nbirds to the top in mammals. The same with the skeletons in the\r\ninvertebrates, from membrane to cartilage, from cartilage to bone,\r\nso that the primitive cartilage remaining in any part of the\r\nskeleton is considered a mark of inferiority.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cope, there has been progressive improvement in the\r\nmechanism of the body--it has become a better and better machine.\r\nThe suspension of the lower jaw, so as to bring the teeth nearer the\r\npower,--the masseter and related muscles,--was a slow evolution and\r\na great advance. The fin is more primitive than the limb; the limbs\r\nthemselves display a constantly increasing differentiation of parts\r\nfrom the batrachian to the mammalian. There was no good ankle joint\r\nin early Eocene times. The model ankle joint is a tongue and groove\r\narrangement, and this is a later evolution. In Eocene times they\r\nwere nearly all flat. The arched foot, too, comes in; this is an\r\nadvance on the flat foot. The bones of the palms and soles are not\r\nlocked until the later Tertiary. The vertebral column progressed in\r\nthe same way, from flat to the double curve and the interlocking\r\nprocess, thus securing greatest strength with greatest mobility. In\r\nthe earliest life locomotion was diffused, later it became\r\nconcentrated. The worm walks with its whole body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we figure to ourselves the geologic history of the earth under\r\nthe symbol of a year of three hundred and sixty-five days, each day\r\na million years, which is probably not far out of the way, then man,\r\nthe biped, the Homo sapiens, in relation to this immense past, is of\r\nto-day, or of this very morning; while the origin of the first\r\nvertebrates, the fishes, from which he has arisen, falls nearer the\r\nmiddle of the great year. Or, dividing this geologic year into four\r\ndivisions or seasons, primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary,\r\nthe fishes fall in the primary, the reptiles in the secondary, the\r\nmammals in the tertiary, and man in the early quaternary.\r\n\r\nIf the fluid earth hardened, and the seas were formed in the first\r\nmonth of this year, then probably the first beginning of life\r\nappeared in the second month, the invertebrate in the third or\r\nfourth,--March or April,--the vertebrates in May or June, the\r\namphibians in July or August, the reptiles in August or September,\r\nthe mammals in October or November, and man in December,--separated\r\nfrom the first beginnings of life by all those millions upon\r\nmillions of years.\r\n\r\nIf life is a ferment, as we are told it is, how long it took this\r\nyeast to leaven the whole loaf! Man is evidently the end of the\r\nseries, he is the top of the biological tree. His specialization\r\nupon physical lines seems to have ended far back in geologic time;\r\nhis future specialization and development is evidently to be upon\r\nmental and spiritual lines. Nature, as I have said, began to tend\r\nmore and more to brains in the early Tertiary,--the autumn of the\r\ngreat year; her best harvest began to mature then, her grain began\r\nto ripen. Indeed, this increased cephalization of animal life in the\r\nfall of the great year does suggest a kind of ripening process, the\r\nturning of the sap and milk, which had been so abundant and so\r\nriotous in the earlier period, into fibre and fruit and seed.\r\n\r\nMay it not be that that long and sultry spring and summer of the\r\nearth's early history, a time probably longer than has since\r\nelapsed, played a part in the development of life analogous to that\r\nplayed by our spring and summer, making it opulent, varied,\r\ngigantic, and making possible the condensation and refinement that\r\ncame with man in the recent period?\r\n\r\nThe earth is a pretty big apple, and the solar tree upon which it\r\nhangs is a pretty big tree, but why may it not have gone through a\r\nkind of ripening process for all that? its elements becoming less\r\ncrude and acrid, and better suited to sustain the higher forms, as\r\nthe eons passed?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the results seem to justify such a fancy. The earth has\r\nslowly undergone a change that may fairly be called a ripening\r\nprocess; its soil has deepened and mellowed, its harsher features\r\nhave softened, more and more color has come to its surface, the\r\nflowers have bloomed, the more succulent fruits have developed, the\r\nair has cleared, and love and benevolence and altruism have been\r\nborn in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife had to creep or swim long before it could walk, and it walked\r\nlong before it could fly; it had feeling long before it had eyes,\r\nand it no doubt had eyes long before it could hear or smell. It was\r\ncapable of motion long before it had limbs; it assimilated food long\r\nbefore it had a mouth or a stomach. It had a digestive tract long\r\nbefore it had a spinal cord; it had nerve ganglia long before it had\r\na well-defined brain. It had sensation long before it had\r\nperception; it was unisexual long before it was bisexual; it had a\r\nshell long before it had a skeleton; it had instinct and reflex\r\naction long before it had self-consciousness and reason. Always from\r\nthe lower to the higher, from the simple to the more complex, and\r\nalways slowly, gently.\r\n\r\nLife has had its foetal stage, its stage of infancy, and childhood,\r\nand maturity, and will doubtless have its old age. It took it\r\nmillions upon millions of years to get out of the sea upon dry land;\r\nand it took it more millions upon dry land, or since the\r\nCarboniferous age, when the air probably first began to be\r\nbreathable,--all the vast stretch of the Secondary and Tertiary\r\nages,--to get upright and develop a reasoning brain, and reach the\r\nestate of man. Step by step, in orderly succession, does creation\r\nmove. In the rising and in the setting of the sun one may see how\r\nnature's great processes steal upon us, silently and unnoticed, yet\r\nalways in sequence, stage succeeding stage, one thing following from\r\nanother, the spectacular moment of sunset following inevitably from\r\nthe quiet, unnoticed sinking of the sun in the west, or the\r\nstartling flash of his rim above the eastern horizon only the\r\nfulfillment of the promise of the dawn. All is development and\r\nsuccession, and man is but the sunrise of the dawn of life in\r\nCambrian or Silurian times, and is linked to that time as one hour\r\nof the day is linked to another.\r\n\r\nThe more complex life became, the more rapidly it seems to have\r\ndeveloped, till it finally makes rapid strides to reach man. One\r\nseems to see Life, like a traveler on the road, going faster and\r\nfaster as it nears its goal. Those long ages of unicellular life in\r\nthe old seas, how immense they appear to have been; then how the age\r\nof invertebrates dragged on, millions upon millions of years; then\r\nthe age of fishes; the Palaeozoic age, how vast--put by Haeckel at\r\nthirty-four millions of years, adding rock strata forty-one thousand\r\nfeet thick; then the Mesozoic or third period, the age of reptiles,\r\neleven million years, with strata twelve thousand feet thick. Then\r\ncame the Caenozoic age, or age of mammals, three million years, with\r\nstrata thirty-one hundred feet thick. The god of life was getting in\r\na hurry now; man was not far off. A new device, the placenta, was\r\nhit upon in this age, and probably the diaphragm and the brain of\r\nanimals, all greatly enlarged. Finally comes the Anthropozoic or\r\nQuaternary age, the age of man, three hundred thousand years, with\r\nnot much addition to the sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nMan seems to be the net result of it all, of all these vast cycles\r\nof Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Caenozoic life. He is the one drop\r\nfinally distilled from the vast weltering sea of lower organic\r\nforms. It looks as if it all had to be before he could be--all the\r\ndelay and waste and struggle and pain--all that long carnival of sea\r\nlife, all that saturnalia of gigantic forms upon the land and in the\r\nair, all that rising and sinking of the continents, and all that\r\nshoveling to and fro and mixing of the soils, before the world was\r\nready for him.\r\n\r\nIn the early Tertiary, millions of years ago, the earth seems to\r\nhave been ripe for man. The fruits and vegetables and the forest\r\ntrees were much as we know them, the animals that have been most\r\nserviceable to us were here, spring and summer and fall and winter\r\ncame and went, evidently birds sang, insects hummed, flowers\r\nbloomed, fruits and grains and nuts ripened, and yet man as man was\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nUnder the city of London is a vast deposit of clay in which\r\nthousands of specimens of fossil fruit have been found like our\r\ndate, cocoanut, areca, custard-apple, gourd, melon, coffee, bean,\r\npepper, and cotton plant, but no sign of man. Why was his\r\ndevelopment so tardy? What animal profited by this rich vegetable\r\nlife? The hope and promise of the human species at that time\r\nprobably slept in some lowly marsupial. Man has gathered up into\r\nhimself, as he traveled his devious way, all the best powers of the\r\nanimal kingdom he has passed through. His brain supplies him with\r\nall that his body lacks, and more. His specialization is in this\r\nhighly developed organ. It is this that separates him so widely from\r\nall other animals.\r\n\r\nMan has no wings, and yet he can soar above the clouds; he is not\r\nswift of foot, and yet he can out-speed the fleetest hound or horse;\r\nhe has but feeble weapons in his organization, and yet he can slay\r\nor master all the great beasts; his eye is not so sharp as that of\r\nthe eagle or the vulture, and yet he can see into the farthest\r\ndepths of siderial space; he has only very feeble occult powers of\r\ncommunication with his fellows, and yet he can talk around the world\r\nand send his voice across mountains and deserts; his hands are weak\r\nthings beside a lion's paw or an elephant's trunk, and yet he can\r\nmove mountains and stay rivers and set bounds to the wildest seas.\r\nHis dog can out-smell him and out-run him and out-bite him, and yet\r\nhis dog looks up to him as to a god. He has erring reason in place\r\nof unerring instinct, and yet he has changed the face of the planet.\r\n\r\nWithout the specialization of the lower animals,--their wonderful\r\nadaptation to particular ends,--their tools, their weapons, their\r\nstrength, their speed, man yet makes them all his servants. His\r\nbrain is more than a match for all the special advantages nature has\r\ngiven them. The one gift of reason makes him supreme in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have a stake in all the past life of the globe. It is no doubt a\r\nscientific fact that your existence and mine were involved in the\r\nfirst cell that appeared, that the first zoophyte furthered our\r\nfortunes, that the first worm gave us a lift. Great good luck came\r\nto us when the first pair of eyes were invented, probably by the\r\ntrilobite back in Silurian times; when the first ear appeared,\r\nprobably in Carboniferous times; when the first pair of lungs grew\r\nout of a fish's air-bladder, probably in Triassic times; when the\r\nfirst four-chambered heart was developed and double circulation\r\nestablished, probably with the first warm-blooded animal in Mesozoic\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThese humble forms started the brain, the nervous system, the\r\ncirculation, sight, hearing, smell; they invented the liver, the\r\nkidneys, the lungs, the heart, the stomach, and led the way to every\r\norgan and power my body and mind have to-day. They were the\r\npioneers, they were the dim remote forebears, they conserved and\r\naugmented the fund of life and passed it along.\r\n\r\nAll their struggles, their discipline, their battles, their\r\nfailures, their successes, were for you and me. Man has had the\r\nexperience of all the animals below him. He has suffered and\r\nstruggled as a fish, he has groveled and devoured as a reptile, he\r\nhas fought and triumphed as a quadruped, he has lived in trees as a\r\nmonkey, he has inhabited caves with the wolf and the bear, he has\r\nroamed the forests and plains as a savage, he has survived without\r\nfire or clothes or weapons or tools, he has lived with the mastodon\r\nand all the saurian monsters, he has held his own against great\r\nodds, he has survived the long battles of the land and the sea, he\r\nweathered the ice-sheet that overrode both hemispheres, he has seen\r\nmany forms become extinct. In the historic period he has survived\r\nplague and pestilence, and want and famine. What must he have\r\nsurvived in prehistoric times! What must he have had to contend with\r\nas a cave-dweller, as a tree-dweller, as a river-drift man! Before\r\nhe had tools or weapons what must he have had to contend with!\r\n\r\nNature was full of sap and rioted in rude strength well up to\r\nQuaternary times, producing extravagant forms which apparently she\r\nhad no use for, as she has discontinued them.\r\n\r\nIn all these things you and I had our part and lot; of this prodigal\r\noutpouring of life we have reaped the benefit; amid these bizarre\r\nforms and this carnival of lust and power, the manward impulse was\r\nnourished and forwarded. In Eocene times nearly half the mammals\r\nlived on other animals; it must have been an age of great slaughter.\r\nIt favored the development of fleetness and cunning, in which we too\r\nhave an interest. Our rude progenitor was surely there in some form,\r\nand escaped the slaughter. Then or later it is thought he took to\r\nthe trees to escape his enemies, as the rats in Jamaica have taken\r\nto the trees to escape the mongoose. To his tree-climbing we\r\nprobably owe our hand, with its opposing thumb.\r\n\r\nIn all his disguises he is still our ancestor. His story reads like\r\na fairy book. Never did nimble fancy of childhood invent such\r\ntransformations--only the transformations are so infinitely slow,\r\nand attended with such struggle and suffering. Strike out the\r\nelement of time and we have before us a spectacle more novel and\r\nstartling than any hocus-pocus or legerdemain that ever set the\r\ncrowd agape.\r\n\r\nIn every form man has passed through, he left behind some old member\r\nor power and took on some new. He left his air-bladder and his gills\r\nand his fins with the fishes; he got his lungs from the dipnoans,\r\nthe precursors of the amphibians, and from these last he got his\r\nfour limbs; he left some part of his anatomy with the reptile, and\r\ntook something in exchange, probably his flexible neck. Somewhere\r\nalong his line he picked up the four-chambered heart, the warm\r\nblood, the placenta, the diaphragm, the plantigrade foot, the\r\nmammary glands--indeed, what has he not picked up on the long road\r\nof his many transformations? He left some of his superfluous\r\nforty-four teeth with his ancestral quadrumana of Eocene times, and\r\nkept thirty-two. He picked up his brain somewhere on the road,\r\nprobably far back in Palaeozoic times, but how has he developed and\r\nenlarged it, till it is now the one supreme thing in the world! His\r\nfear, his cunning, his anger, his treachery, his hoggishness--all\r\nhis animal passions--he brought with him from his animal ancestors;\r\nbut his moral and spiritual nature, his altruism, his veneration,\r\nhis religious emotions, his aesthetic perceptions--have come to him\r\nas a man, supplementing his lower nature, as it were, with another\r\norder of senses--a finer sight, a finer touch, wrought in him by the\r\ndiscipline of life, and the wonder of the world about him, beginning\r\nde novo in him only as the wing began de novo in the bird, or the\r\ncolor began de novo in the flower--struck out from preexisting\r\npotentialities. The father of the eye is the light, and the father\r\nof the ear is the vibration of the air, but the father of man's\r\nhigher nature is a question of quite another sort. About the only\r\nthing in his physical make-up that man can call his own is his chin.\r\nNone of the orders below him seem to have what can strictly be\r\ncalled a chin.\r\n\r\nMan owes his five toes and five fingers to the early amphibians of\r\nthe sub-carboniferous times. The first tangible evidence of these\r\nfive toes upon the earth is, to me, very interesting. The earliest\r\nrecord of them that I have heard of is furnished by a slab of shale\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, upon which, while it was yet soft mud, our first\r\nfive-toed ancestor had left the imprint of his four feet. He was\r\nevidently a small, short-legged gentleman with a stride of only\r\nabout thirteen inches, and he carried a tail instead of a cane. He\r\nwas probably taking a stroll upon the shores of that vast\r\nMediterranean Sea that occupied all the interior of the continent\r\nwhen he crossed his mud flat. It was raining that morning--how many\r\nmillion years ago?--as we know from the imprint of the raindrops\r\nupon the mud. Probably the shower did not cause him to quicken his\r\npace, as amphibians rather like the rain. Just what his immediate\r\nforbears were like, or what the forms were that connected him with\r\nthe fishes, we shall probably never know. Doubtless the great book\r\nof the rocky strata somewhere holds the secret, if we are ever lucky\r\nenough to open it at the right place. How many other secrets, that\r\nevolutionists would like to know, those torn and crumpled leaves\r\nhold!\r\n\r\nIt is something to me to know that it rained that day when our\r\namphibian ancestor ventured out. The weather was beginning to get\r\norganized also, and settling down to business. It had got beyond the\r\nstate of perpetual mist and fog of the earlier ages, and the\r\nraindrops were playing their parts. Yet, from all the evidence we\r\nhave, we infer that the climate was warm and very humid, like that\r\nof a greenhouse, and that vegetation, mostly giant ferns and rushes\r\nand lycopods, was very rank, but there was no grass, or moss, no\r\ndeciduous trees, or flowers, or fruit, as we know these things.\r\n\r\nA German anatomist says that we have the vestiges of one hundred and\r\neighty organs which have stuck to us from our animal ancestors,--now\r\nuseless, or often worse than useless, like the vermiform appendix.\r\nEleven of these superannuated and obsolete organs we bring from the\r\nfishes, four from amphibians and reptiles. The external ear is a\r\nvestige--of no use any more. Our dread of snakes we no doubt\r\ninherited from our simian ancestors.\r\n\r\nHow life refined and humanized as time went on, sobered down and\r\nbecame more meditative, keeping step, no doubt, with the\r\namelioration of the soil out of which all life finally comes. Life's\r\nbank account in the soil was constantly increasing; more and more of\r\nthe inorganic was wrought up into the organic; the value of every\r\nclod underfoot was raised. The riot of gigantic forms ceased, and\r\nthey became ashes. The giant and uncouth vegetation ceased, and left\r\nashes or coal. The beech, the maple, the oak, the olive, the palm\r\ncame in. The giant sea serpents disappeared; the horse, the ox, the\r\nswine, the dog, the quail, the dove came in. The placental mammals\r\ndeveloped. The horse grew in size and beauty. When we first come\r\nupon his trail, he is a four-hoof-toed animal no larger than a fox.\r\nLater on we find him the size of a sheep with one of his toes gone;\r\nstill later--many hundred thousand years, no doubt--we find him the\r\nsize of a donkey, with still fewer toes, and so on till we reach the\r\nsuperb creature we know.\r\n\r\nThe creative energy seems to have worked in geologic time and in the\r\ngeologic field just as it works here and now, in yonder vineyard or\r\nin yonder marsh,--blindly, experimentally, but persistently and\r\nsuccessfully. The winged seeds find their proper soil, because they\r\nsearch in every direction; the climbing vines find their support,\r\nbecause in the same blind way they feel in all directions. Plants\r\nand animals and races of men grope their way to new fields, to new\r\npowers, to new inventions.\r\n\r\nIndeed, how like an inventor Nature has worked, constantly improving\r\nher models, adding to and changing as experience would seem to\r\ndictate! She has developed her higher and more complex forms as man\r\nhas developed his printing-press, or steam-engine, from rude,\r\nsimple beginnings. From the two-chambered heart of the fish she made\r\nthe treble-chambered heart of the frog, and then the four-\r\nchambered heart of the mammal. The first mammary gland had no\r\nnipples; the milk oozed out and was licked off by the young. The\r\nnipple was a great improvement, as was the power of suckling in the\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nExperimenting and experimenting endlessly, taking a forward step\r\nonly when compelled by necessity,--this is the way of\r\nNature,--experimenting with eyes, with ears, with teeth, with limbs,\r\nwith feet, with toes, with wings, with bladders and lungs, with\r\nscales and armors, hitting upon the backbone only after long trials\r\nwith other forms, hitting upon the movable eye only after long ages\r\nof other eyes, hitting on the mammal only after long ages of\r\negg-laying vertebrates, hitting on the placenta only\r\nrecently,--experimenting all around the circle, discarding and\r\ninventing, taking ages to perfect the nervous system, ages and ages\r\nto develop the centralized ganglia, the brain. First life was like a\r\nrabble, a mob, without thought or head, then slowly organization\r\nwent on, as it were, from family to clan, from clan to tribe, from\r\ntribe to nation, or centralized government--the brain of man--all\r\nparts duly subordinated and directed,--millions of cells organized\r\nand working on different functions to one grand end,--cooperation,\r\nfraternization, division of labor, altruism, etc.\r\n\r\nThe cell was the first invention; it is the unit of life,--a speck\r\nof protoplasm with a nucleus. To educate this cell till it could\r\ncombine with its fellows and form the higher animals seems to have\r\nbeen the aim of the creative energy. First the cell, then\r\ncombinations of cells, then combinations of combinations, then more\r\nand more complex combinations till the body of man is reached, where\r\nendless confraternities of cells, all with different functions,\r\nworking to build and sustain different organs,--brain, heart,\r\nliver, muscles, nerves,--yet all working together for one grand\r\nend--the body and mind of man. In their last analysis, all made up\r\nof the same cells--their combinations and organization making the\r\ndifferent forms.\r\n\r\nEvolution touches all forms but tarries with few. Many are called\r\nbut few are chosen--chosen to lead the man-impulse upward. Myriads\r\nof forms are left behind, like driftwood caught in the eddies of a\r\ncurrent. The clam has always remained a clam, the oyster remained an\r\noyster. The cockroach is about the same creature to-day that it was\r\nuntold aeons ago; so is the shark, and so are many other forms of\r\nmarine life. Often where old species have gone out and new come in,\r\nno progress has been made.\r\n\r\nEvolution concentrates along certain lines. The biological tree\r\nbehaves like another tree, branches die and drop off (species become\r\nextinct), others mature and remain, while some central shoot pushes\r\nupward. Many of the huge reptilian and mammalian branches perished\r\nin comparatively late times.\r\n\r\nAs nothing is more evident than that the same measure of life or of\r\nvital energy--power of growth, power of resistance, power of\r\nreproduction--is not meted out equally to all the individuals of a\r\nspecies, or to all species, so it is evident that this power of\r\nprogressive development is not meted out equally to all races of\r\nmankind, or to all of the individuals of the same race. The central\r\nimpulse of development seems to have come from the East, in historic\r\ntimes at least, and to have followed the line of the Mediterranean,\r\nto have culminated in Europe. And this progress has certainly been\r\nthe work of a few minds--minds exceptionally endowed.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the barbarian races do not progress. Their\r\nexceptional minds or characters do not lead the tribes to higher\r\nplanes of thought, In all countries we still see these barbarous\r\npeople which man in his progress has left behind. Our civilization\r\nis like a field of light that fades off into shadows and darkness.\r\nThere is this margin of undeveloped humanity on all sides. Always\r\nhas it been so in the animal life of the globe; the higher forms\r\nhave been pushed up from the lower, and the lower have remained and\r\ncontinued to multiply unchanged.\r\n\r\nIt seems as if some central and cherished impulse had pushed on\r\nthrough each form, and by successive steps had climbed from height\r\nto height, gaining a little here and a little there, intensifying\r\nand concentrating as time went on, very vague and diffuse at first,\r\nembryonic so to speak, during the first half of the great geologic\r\nyear, but quickening more and more, differentiating more and more,\r\ndelayed and defeated many times, no doubt, yet never destroyed,\r\nleaving form after form unchanged behind it, till it at last reached\r\nits goal in man.\r\n\r\nAfter evolution has done all it can do for us toward solving the\r\nmystery of creation, much remains unsolved.\r\n\r\nThrough evolution we see creation in travail-pains for millions of\r\nyears to bring forth the varied forms of life as we know them; but\r\nthe mystery of the inception of this life, and of the origin of the\r\nlaws that have governed its development, remains. What lies back of\r\nit all? Who or what planted the germ of the biological tree, and\r\npredetermined all its branches? What determined one branch to\r\neventuate in man, another in the dog, the horse, the bird, or the\r\nreptile?\r\n\r\nFrom the finite or human point of view we feel compelled to say some\r\nvaster being or intelligence must have had the thought of all these\r\nthings from the beginning or before the beginning.\r\n\r\nIt is quite impossible for me to believe that fortuitous\r\nvariation--variation all around the circle--could have resulted in\r\nthe evolution of man. There must have been a predetermined tendency\r\nto variation in certain directions. To introduce chance into the\r\nworld is to introduce chaos. No more would the waters of the\r\ninteriors of the continents find their way to the sea, were there\r\nnot a slant in that direction, than could haphazard variation,\r\nthough checked and controlled by natural selection, result in the\r\nproduction of the race of man. This view may be only the outcome of\r\nour inevitable anthropomorphism which we cannot escape from, no\r\nmatter how deep we dive or high we soar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE DIVINE ABYSS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn making the journey to the great Southwest,--Colorado, New\r\nMexico, and Arizona,--if one does not know his geology, he is pretty\r\nsure to wish he did, there is so much geology scattered over all\r\nthese Southwestern landscapes, crying aloud to be read. The book of\r\nearthly revelation, as shown by the great science, lies wide open in\r\nthat land, as it does in few other places on the globe. Its leaves\r\nfairly flutter in the wind, and the print is so large that he who\r\nruns on the California Limited may read it. Not being able to read\r\nit at all, or not taking any interest in it, is like going to Rome\r\nor Egypt or Jerusalem, knowing nothing of the history of those\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nOf course, we have just as much geology in the East and Middle West,\r\nbut the books are closed and sealed, as it were, by the enormous\r\nlapse of time since these portions of the continent became dry land.\r\nThe eroding and degrading forces have ages since passed the meridian\r\nof their day's work, and grass and verdure hide their footsteps. But\r\nin the great West and Southwest, the gods of erosion and degradation\r\nseem yet in the heat and burden of the day's toil. Their unfinished\r\nlandscapes meet the eye on every hand. Many of the mountains look as\r\nif they were blocked out but yesterday, and one sees vast naked\r\nflood-plains, and painted deserts and bad lands and dry\r\nlake-bottoms, that suggest a world yet in the making.\r\n\r\nSome force has scalped the hills, ground the mountains, strangled\r\nthe rivers, channeled the plains, laid bare the succession of\r\ngeologic ages, stripping off formation after formation like a\r\ngarment, or cutting away the strata over hundreds of square miles,\r\nas we pry a slab from a rock--and has done it all but yesterday. If\r\nwe break the slab in the prying, and thus secure only part of it,\r\nleaving an abrupt jagged edge on the part that remains, we have\r\nstill a better likeness of the work of these great geologic\r\nquarrymen. But other workmen, invisible to our eyes, have carved\r\nthese jagged edges into novel and beautiful forms.\r\n\r\nThe East is old, old! the West, with the exception of the Rocky\r\nMountains, is of yesterday in comparison. The Hudson was an ancient\r\nriver before the Mississippi was born, and the Catskills were being\r\nslowly carved from a vast plateau while the rocks that were to form\r\nmany of the Western ranges were being laid down as sediment in the\r\nbottom of the sea. California is yet in her teens, while New England\r\nin comparison is an octogenarian. Just as much geology in the East\r\nas in the West, did I say? Not as much visible geology, not as much\r\nby many chapters of earth history, not as much by all the later\r\nformations, by most of the Mesozoic and Tertiary deposits. The vast\r\nseries of sedimentary rocks since the Carboniferous age, to say\r\nnothing of the volcanic, that make up these periods, are largely\r\nwanting east of the Mississippi, except in New Jersey and in some of\r\nthe Gulf States. They are recent. They are like the history of our\r\nown period compared with that of Egypt and Judea. It is mainly these\r\nlater formations--the Permian, the Jurassic, the Triassic, the\r\nCretaceous, the Eocene,--that give the prevailing features to the\r\nSouth-western landscape that so astonish Eastern eyes. From them\r\ncome most of the petrified remains of that great army of extinct\r\nreptiles and mammals--the three-toed horse, the sabre-toothed\r\ntiger, the brontosaurus, the fin-backed lizard, the imperial\r\nmammoth, the various dinosaurs, some of them gigantic in form and\r\nfearful in aspect--that of late years have appeared in our museums\r\nand that throw so much light upon the history of the animal life of\r\nthe globe. Most of the sedimentary rocks of New York and New England\r\nwere laid down before these creatures existed.\r\n\r\nNow I am not going to write an essay on the geology of the West, for\r\nI really have little first-hand knowledge upon that subject, but I\r\nwould indicate the kind of interest in the country I was most\r\nconscious of during my recent trip to the Pacific Coast and beyond.\r\nIndeed, quite a geologic fever raged in me most of the time. The\r\nrocks attracted me more than the birds, the sculpturing of the\r\nlandscapes engaged my attention more than the improvements of the\r\nfarms--what Nature had done more than what man was doing. The purely\r\nscenic aspects of the country are certainly remarkable, and the\r\nhuman aspects interesting, but underneath these things, and striking\r\nthrough them, lies a vast world of time and change that to me is\r\nstill more remarkable, and still more interesting. I could not look\r\nout of the car windows without seeing the spectre of geologic time\r\nstalking across the hills and plains.\r\n\r\nAs one leaves the prairie States and nears the great Southwest, he\r\nfinds Nature in a new mood--she is dreaming of canyons; both cliffs\r\nand soil have canyon stamped upon them, so that your eye, if alert,\r\nis slowly prepared for the wonders of rock-carving it is to see on\r\nthe Colorado. The canyon form seems inherent in soil and rock. The\r\nchannels of the little streams are canyons, vertical sides of adobe\r\nsoil, as deep as they are broad, rectangle grooves in the ground.\r\n\r\nThrough all this arid region nature is abrupt, angular, and\r\nsudden--the plain squarely abutting the cliff, the cliff walling the\r\ncanon; the dry water-course sunk in the plain like a carpenter's\r\ngroove into a plank. Cloud and sky look the same as at home, but the\r\nearth is a new earth--new geologically, and new in the lines of its\r\nlandscapes. It seems by the forms she develops that Nature must use\r\ntools that she long since discarded in the East. She works as if\r\nwith the square and the saw and the compass, and uses implements\r\nthat cut like chisels and moulding-planes. Right lines,\r\nwell-defined angles, and tablelike tops of buttes and mesas\r\nalternate with perfect curves, polished domes, carved needles, and\r\nfluted escarpments.\r\n\r\nIn the features of our older landscapes there is little or nothing\r\nthat suggests architectural forms or engineering devices; in the Far\r\nWest one sees such forms and devices everywhere.\r\n\r\nIn visiting the Petrified Forests in northern Arizona we stood on\r\nthe edge of a great rolling plain and looked down upon a wide,\r\ndeeply eroded stretch of country below us that suggested a vast army\r\nencampment, covered as it was with great dome-shaped, tent-like\r\nmounds of a light terra-cotta color, with open spaces like streets\r\nor avenues between them. There were hundreds or thousands of these\r\nearthy tents stretching away for twenty-five miles. Along the\r\nhorizon was a gigantic stockade of red, rounded pillars, or a solid\r\nline of mosque-like temples. How unreal, how spectral it all seemed!\r\nNot a sound or sign of life in the whole painted solitude--a\r\ndeserted camp, or one upon which the silence of death had fallen.\r\nHere, in Carboniferous times, grew the gigantic fern-like trees, the\r\nSigillaria and Lepidodendron, whose petrified trunks, for aeons\r\nburied beneath the deposit of the Permian seas, and then, during\r\nother aeons, slowly uncovered by the gentle action of the eroding\r\nrains, we saw scattered on the ground.\r\n\r\nYou first see Nature beginning to form the canon habit in Colorado\r\nand making preliminary studies for her masterpiece, the Grand\r\nCanon. Huge square towers and truncated cones and needles and\r\nspires break the horizon-lines. Here all her water-courses, wet or\r\ndry, are deep grooves in the soil, with striking and pretty carvings\r\nand modelings adorning their vertical sides. In the railway cuts you\r\nsee the same effects--miniature domes and turrets and other canon\r\nfeatures carved out by the rains. The soil is massive and does not\r\ncrumble like ours and seek the angle of repose; it gives way in\r\nmasses like a brick wall. It is architectural soil, it seeks\r\napproximately the right angle--the level plain or the vertical wall.\r\nIt erodes easily under running water, but it does not slide; sand\r\nand clay are in such proportions as to make a brittle but not a\r\nfriable soil.\r\n\r\nBefore you are out of Colorado, you begin to see these novel\r\narchitectural features on the horizon-line--the canon turned bottom\r\nside up, as it were. In New Mexico, the canon habit of the erosion\r\nforces is still more pronounced. The mountain-lines are often as\r\narchitectural in the distance, or arbitrary, as the sky-line of a\r\ncity. You may see what you half persuade yourself is a huge brick\r\nbuilding notching the horizon,--an asylum, a seminary, a hotel,--but\r\nit is only a fragment of red sandstone, carved out by wind and rain.\r\n\r\nPresently the high colors of the rocks appear--high cliffs with\r\nterra-cotta facades, and a new look in the texture of the rocks, a\r\nsoft, beaming, less frowning expression, and colored as if by the\r\nWestern sunsets. We are looking upon much younger rocks geologically\r\nthan we see at home, and they have the tints and texture of youth.\r\nThe landscape and the mountains look young, because they look\r\nunfinished, like a house half up. The workmen have but just knocked\r\noff work to go to dinner; their great trenches, their freshly opened\r\nquarries, their huge dumps, their foundations, their cyclopean\r\nmasonry, their half-finished structures breaking the horizon-lines,\r\ntheir square gashes through the mountains,--all impress the eyes of\r\na traveler from the eastern part of the continent, where the\r\nearth-building and earth-carving forces finished their work ages\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHence it is that when one reaches the Grand canon of the Colorado,\r\nif he has kept his eyes and mind open, he is prepared to see\r\nstriking and unusual things. But he cannot be fully prepared for\r\njust what he does see, no matter how many pictures of it he may have\r\nseen, or how many descriptions of it he may have read.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who took a lively interest in my Western trip wrote\r\nme that he wished he could have been present with his kodak when we\r\nfirst looked upon the Grand Canon. Did he think he could have got a\r\npicture of our souls? His camera would have shown him only our\r\nsilent, motionless forms as we stood transfixed by that first view\r\nof the stupendous spectacle. Words do not come readily to one's\r\nlips, or gestures to one's body, in the presence of such a scene.\r\nOne of my companions said that the first thing that came into her\r\nmind was the old text, \"Be still, and know that I am God.\" To be\r\nstill on such an occasion is the easiest thing in the world, and to\r\nfeel the surge of solemn and reverential emotions is equally easy;\r\nis, indeed, almost inevitable. The immensity of the scene, its\r\ntranquillity, its order, its strange, new beauty, and the monumental\r\ncharacter of its many forms--all these tend to beget in the beholder\r\nan attitude of silent wonder and solemn admiration. I wished at the\r\nmoment that we might have been alone with the glorious\r\nspectacle,--that we had hit upon an hour when the public had gone to\r\ndinner. The smoking and joking tourists sauntering along in apparent\r\nindifference, or sitting with their backs to the great geologic\r\ndrama, annoyed me. I pity the person who can gaze upon the spectacle\r\nunmoved. Some are actually terrified by it. I was told of a strong\r\nman, an eminent lawyer from a Western city, who literally fell to\r\nthe earth at the first view, and could not again be induced to look\r\nupon it. I saw a woman prone upon the ground near the brink at Hopi\r\nPoint, weeping silently and long; but from what she afterward told\r\nme I know it was not from terror or sorrow, but from the\r\noverpowering gladness of the ineffable beauty and harmony of the\r\nscene. It moved her like the grandest music. Her inebriate soul\r\ncould find relief only in tears.\r\n\r\nHarriet Monroe was so wrought up by the first view that she says she\r\nhad to fight against the desperate temptation to fling herself down\r\ninto the soft abyss, and thus redeem the affront which the very\r\nbeating of her heart had offered to the inviolable solitude. Charles\r\nDudley Warner said of it, \"I experienced for a moment an\r\nindescribable terror of nature, a confusion of mind, a fear to be\r\nalone in such a presence.\"\r\n\r\nIt is beautiful, oh, how beautiful! but it is a beauty that awakens\r\na feeling of solemnity and awe. We call it the \"Divine Abyss.\" It\r\nseems as much of heaven as of earth. Of the many descriptions of it,\r\nnone seems adequate. To rave over it, or to pour into it a torrent\r\nof superlatives, is of little avail. My companion came nearer the\r\nmark when she quietly repeated from Revelation, \"And he carried me\r\naway in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that\r\ngreat city, the holy Jerusalem.\" It does, indeed, suggest a far-off,\r\nhalf-sacred antiquity, some greater Jerusalem, Egypt, Babylon, or\r\nIndia. We speak of it as a scene: it is more like a vision, so\r\nforeign is it to all other terrestrial spectacles, and so\r\nsurpassingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nTo ordinary folk the sight is so extraordinary, so unlike everything\r\none's experience has yielded, and so unlike the results of the usual\r\nhaphazard working of the blind forces of nature, that I did not\r\nwonder when people whom I met on the rim asked me what I supposed\r\ndid all this. I could even sympathize with the remark of an old\r\nwoman visitor who is reported to have said that she thought they had\r\nbuilt the canon too near the hotel. The enormous cleavage which the\r\ncanon shows, the abrupt drop from the brink of thousands of feet,\r\nthe sheer faces of perpendicular walls of dizzy height, give at\r\nfirst the impression that it is all the work of some titanic\r\nquarryman, who must have removed cubic miles of strata as we remove\r\ncubic yards of earth. Go out to Hopi Point or O'Neil's Point, and,\r\nas you emerge from the woods, you get a glimpse of a blue or\r\nrose-purple gulf opening before you. The solid ground ceases\r\nsuddenly, and an aerial perspective, vast and alluring, takes its\r\nplace; another heaven, countersunk in the earth, transfixes you on\r\nthe brink. \"Great God!\" I can fancy the first beholder of it saying,\r\n\"what is this? Do I behold the transfiguration of the earth? Has the\r\nsolid ground melted into thin air? Is there a firmament below as\r\nwell as above? Has the earth veil at last been torn aside, and the\r\nred heart of the globe been laid bare?\" If this first witness was\r\nnot at once overcome by the beauty of the earthly revelation before\r\nhim, or terrified by its strangeness and power, he must have stood\r\nlong, awed, spellbound, speechless with astonishment, and thrilled\r\nwith delight. He may have seen vast and glorious prospects from\r\nmountaintops, he may have looked down upon the earth and seen it\r\nunroll like a map before him; but he had never before looked into\r\nthe earth as through a mighty window or open door, and beheld depths\r\nand gulfs of space, with their atmospheric veils and illusions and\r\nvast perspectives, such as he had seen from mountain-summits, but\r\nwith a wealth of color and a suggestion of architectural and\r\nmonumental remains, and a strange, almost unearthly beauty, such as\r\nno mountain-view could ever have afforded him. Three features of the\r\ncanon strike one at once: its unparalleled magnitude, its\r\narchitectural forms and suggestions, and its opulence of color\r\neffects--a chasm nearly a mile deep and from ten to twenty miles\r\nwide, in which Niagara would be only as a picture upon your walls,\r\nin which the Pyramids, seen from the rim, would appear only like\r\nlarge tents, in which the largest building upon the earth would\r\ndwindle to insignificant proportions. There are amphitheatres and\r\nmighty aisles eight miles long and three or four miles wide and\r\nthree or four thousand feet deep. There are room-like spaces eight\r\nhundred feet high; there are well-defined alcoves with openings a\r\nmile wide; there are niches six hundred feet high overhung by arched\r\nlintels; there are pinnacles and rude statues from one hundred to\r\ntwo hundred feet high. Here I am running at once into allusions to\r\nthe architectural features and suggestions of the canon, which must\r\nplay a prominent part in all faithful attempts to describe it. There\r\nare huge, truncated towers, vast, horizontal mouldings; there is the\r\nsemblance of balustrades on the summit of a noble facade. In one of\r\nthe immense halls we saw, on an elevated platform, the outlines of\r\nthree enormous chairs, fifty feet or more high, and behind and above\r\nthem the suggestion of three more chairs in partial ruin. Indeed,\r\nthere is such an opulence of architectural forms in this divine\r\nabyss as one has never before dreamed of seeing wrought by the blind\r\nforces of nature. These forces have here foreshadowed all the\r\nnoblest architecture of the world. Many of the vast carved and\r\nornamental masses which diversify the canon have been fitly named\r\ntemples, as Shiva's Temple, a mile high, carved out of the red\r\nCarboniferous limestone, and remarkably symmetrical in its outlines.\r\nNear it is the Temple of Isis, the Temple of Osiris, the Buddha\r\nTemple, the Horus Temple, and the Pyramid of Cheops. Farther to the\r\neast is the Diva Temple, the Brahma Temple, the Temple of Zoroaster,\r\nand the Tomb of Odin. Indeed, everywhere are there suggestions of\r\ntemples and tombs, pagodas and pyramids, on a scale that no work of\r\nhuman hands can rival. \"The grandest objects,\" says Major Dutton,\r\n\"are merged in a congregation of others equally grand.\" With the\r\nwealth of form goes a wealth of color. Never, I venture to say, were\r\nreds and browns and grays and vermilions more appealing to the eye\r\nthan they are as they softly glow in this great canyon. The\r\ncolor-scheme runs from the dark, sombre hue of the gneiss at the\r\nbottom, up through the yellowish brown of the Cambrian layers, and\r\non up through seven or eight broad bands of varying tints of red and\r\nvermilion, to the broad yellowish-gray at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe north side of the canyon has been much more deeply and\r\nelaborately carved than the south side; most of the great\r\narchitectural features are on the north side--the huge temples and\r\nfortresses and amphitheatres. The strata dip very gently to the\r\nnorth and northeast, while the slope of the surface is to the south\r\nand southeast. This has caused the drainage from the great northern\r\nplateaus to flow into the canyon and thus cut and carve the north\r\nside as we behold it.\r\n\r\nThe visitor standing upon the south side looks across the great\r\nchasm upon the bewildering maze of monumental forms, some of them as\r\nsuggestive of human workmanship as anything in nature well can be,\r\n--crumbling turrets and foundations, forms as distinctly square as\r\nany work of man's hands, vast fortress-like structures with salients\r\nand entering angles and wing walls resisting the siege of time, huge\r\npyramidal piles rising story on story, three thousand feet or more\r\nabove their foundations, each successive story or superstructure\r\nfaced by a huge vertical wall which rises from a sloping talus that\r\nconnects it with the story next below. The slopes or taluses\r\nrepresent the softer rock, the vertical walls the harder layers.\r\nUsually four or five of these receding stories make up each temple\r\nor pyramid. Some of the larger structures show all the strata from\r\nthe cap of light Carboniferous limestone at the top to the gray\r\nCambrian sandstone at the bottom. From others, such as the Temple of\r\nIsis, all the upper formations are gone with a pile of disintegrated\r\nred sandstone, like a mass of brick dust on the top where the\r\nfragment of the old red wall made its last stand. In those masses,\r\nwhich are still crowned with the light gray limestone, one sees how\r\nsurely the process of disintegration is going on by the fragments\r\nand debris of light gray rock, like the chips of giant workmen, that\r\nstrew the deeper-colored slopes below them. These fragments fade out\r\nas the eye drops down the slopes, as if they had melted like bits of\r\nice. Indeed, the melting of ice and the dissolution of a rock do not\r\ndiffer much except that one is very rapid and the other infinitely\r\nslow. In time (not man's time, but the Lord's time), all these light\r\nmasses that cap the huge temples will be weathered away, yea, and\r\nall the vast red layers beneath them, and the huge structures will\r\nbe slowly consumed by time. The Colorado River will carry their\r\nashes to the sea, and where they once stood will be seen gray,\r\ndesert-like plateaus. Their outlines now stand out like skeletons\r\nfrom which the flesh has been removed--sharp, angular, obtrusive,\r\nbut bound together as by ligaments of granite. The tooth of time\r\ngnaws at them day and night and has been gnawing for thousands of\r\ncenturies, so that in some cases only their stumps remain. From the\r\nTemple of Isis and the Tomb of Odin the two or three upper stories\r\nare gone.\r\n\r\nOn the next page is the ground plan of the Temple of Isis, about\r\ntwenty-five hundred feet high. The first story is about a thousand\r\nfeet; the second, three hundred and fifty feet; the third, one\r\nhundred and fifty feet; the fourth, five hundred feet; and the\r\nfifth, five hundred feet. The finish at the top shows as a heavy\r\ncrumbling wall, probably one hundred feet or more high. How the mass\r\nseems to be resisting the siege of time, throwing out its salients\r\nhere and there, and meeting the onset of the foes like a military\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nThe pyramidal form of these rock-masses is accounted for by the fact\r\nthat they were carved out from the top downward, and that each\r\nsuccessive story is vastly older than the one immediately beneath\r\nit. The erosive forces have been working whole geologic ages longer\r\non the top layer of rock than on the bottom layer; hence the topmost\r\nones are entirely gone or else reduced to small dimensions. But what\r\nfeature or quality of the rock it is that lends itself so readily or\r\nso inevitably to these architectural forms--the four square\r\nfoundations, the end pilasters and balustrades, and so on--is to me\r\nnot so clear. The peculiar rectangular jointings, the alternation of\r\nsoft and hard layers, the nearly horizontal strata, and other\r\nthings, no doubt, enter into the problem. Many of these features are\r\nfound in our older geology of the East, as in the Catskills\r\n--horizontal strata, hard and soft layers alternating, but with the\r\nvertical jointing less pronounced; hence the Catskills have few\r\ncanon-like valleys, though there are here and there huge gashes\r\nthrough the mountains that give a canon effect, and there are\r\ngigantic walls high up on the face of some of the mountains that\r\nsuggest one side of a mighty canon. In the climate of the Catskills\r\nthe rock-masses of the Colorado would crumble much more rapidly than\r\nthey do here. The lines of many of these natural temples or\r\nfortresses are still more lengthened and attenuated than those of\r\nthe Temple of Isis, appearing like mere skeletons of their former\r\nselves. The forms that weather out the formation above this, the\r\nPermian, appear to be more rotund, and tend more to domes and\r\nrounded hills.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising features of the Grand canon is its\r\ncleanness--its freedom from debris. It is a home of the gods, swept\r\nand garnished; no litter or confusion or fragments of fallen and\r\nbroken rocky walls anywhere. Those vast sloping taluses are as clean\r\nas a meadow; rarely at the foot of the huge vertical walls do you\r\nsee a fragment of fallen rock. It is as if the processes of erosion\r\nand degradation were as gentle as the dews and the snows, and carved\r\nout this mighty abyss grain by grain, which has probably been the\r\ncase. That much of this red sandstone, from the amount of iron it\r\ncontains, or from some other cause, disintegrates easily and\r\nrapidly, is very obvious. Looking down from Hopi Point upon a vast\r\nridge called the \"Man-of-War,\" one sees on the top, where once there\r\nmust have been a huge wall of rock, a long level area of red soil\r\nthat suggests a garden, the more so because it is regularly divided\r\nup into sections by straight lines of huge stone placed as if by the\r\nhands of man.\r\n\r\nOne's sense of the depths of the canyon is so great that it almost\r\nmakes one dizzy to see the little birds fly out over it, or plunge\r\ndown into it. One seems to fear that they too will get dizzy and\r\nfall to the bottom. We watched a line of tourists on mules creeping\r\nalong the trail across the inner plateau, and the unaided eye had\r\ntrouble to hold them; they looked like little red ants. The eye has\r\nmore difficulty in estimating sizes and distances beneath it than\r\nwhen they are above or on a level with it, because it is so much\r\nless familiar with depth than with height or lateral dimensions.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable and unexpected feature of the canyon is its look\r\nof ordered strength. Nearly all the lines are lines of greatest\r\nstrength. The prevailing profile line everywhere is that shown\r\nherewith. The upright lines represent lines of cyclopean masonry,\r\nand the slant is the talus that connects them, covered with a short,\r\nsage-colored growth of some kind, and as soft to the eye as the turf\r\nof our fields. The simple, strong structural lines assert themselves\r\neverywhere, and give that look of repose and security characteristic\r\nof the scene. The rocky forces always seem to retreat in good order\r\nbefore the onslaught of time; there is neither rout nor confusion;\r\neverywhere they present a calm upright front to the foe. And the\r\nfallen from their ranks, where are they? A cleaner battlefield\r\nbetween the forces of nature one rarely sees.\r\n\r\nThe weaker portions are, of course, constantly giving way. The\r\nelements incessantly lay siege to these fortresses and take\r\nadvantage of every flaw or unguarded point, so that what stands has\r\nbeen seven times, yea, seventy times seven times tested, and hence\r\ngives the impression of impregnable strength. The angles and curves,\r\nthe terraces and foundations, seem to be the work of some master\r\nengineer, with only here and there a toppling rock.\r\n\r\nI was puzzled to explain to myself the reason of a certain friendly\r\nand familiar look which the great abyss had for me. One sees or\r\nfeels at a glance that it was not born of the throes and convulsions\r\nof nature--of earthquake shock or volcanic explosion. It does not\r\nsuggest the crush of matter and the wreck of worlds. Clearly it is\r\nthe work of the more gentle and beneficent forces. This probably\r\naccounts for the friendly look. Some of the inner slopes and\r\nplateaus seemed like familiar ground to me: I must have played upon\r\nthem when a school-boy. Bright Angel Creek, for some inexplicable\r\nreason, recalled a favorite trout-stream of my native hills, and the\r\nold Cambrian plateau that edges the inner chasm, as we looked down\r\nupon it from nearly four thousand feet above, looked like the brown\r\nmeadow where we played ball in the old school-days, friendly,\r\ntender, familiar, in its slopes and terraces, in its tints and\r\nbasking sunshine, but grand and awe-inspiring in its depths, its\r\nhuge walls, and its terrific precipices.\r\n\r\nThe geologists are agreed that the canyon is only of yesterday in\r\ngeologic time,--the Middle Tertiary,--and yet behold the duration of\r\nthat yesterday as here revealed, probably a million years or more!\r\nWe can no more form any conception of such time than we can of the\r\nsize of the sun or of the distance of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nThe forces that did all this vast delving and sculpturing--the air,\r\nthe rains, the frost, the sunshine--are as active now as they ever\r\nwere; but their activity is a kind of slumbering that rarely makes a\r\nsign. Only at long intervals is the silence of any part of the\r\nprofound abyss broken by the fall of loosened rocks or sliding\r\ntalus. We ourselves saw where a huge splinter of rock had recently\r\ndropped from the face of the cliff. In time these loosened masses\r\ndisappear, as if they melted like ice. A city not made with hands,\r\nbut as surely not eternal in the earth! In our humid and severe\r\nEastern climate, frost and ice and heavyrains working together, all\r\nthese architectural forms would have crumbled long ago, and fertile\r\nfields or hill-slopes would have taken their place. In the older\r\nHawaiian Islands, which probably also date from Tertiary times, the\r\nrains have carved enormous canons and amphitheatres out of the hard\r\nvolcanic rock, in some places grinding the mountains to such a thin\r\nedge that a man may literally sit astride them, each leg pointing\r\ninto opposite valleys. In the next geologic age, the temples and\r\nmonuments of the Grand Canon will have largely disappeared, and the\r\nstupendous spectacle will be mainly a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nIt seems to take millions of years to tame a mountain, to curb its\r\nrude, savage power, to soften its outlines, and bring fertility out\r\nof the elemental crudeness and barrenness. But time and the gentle\r\nrains of heaven will do it, as they have done it in the East, and as\r\nthey are fast doing it in the West.\r\n\r\nAn old guide with whom I talked, who had lived in and about the\r\ncanon for twenty-six years, said, \"While we have been sitting here,\r\nthe canon has widened and deepened\"; which was, of course, the\r\nliteral truth, the mathematical truth, but the widening and\r\ndeepening could not have been apprehended by human sense.\r\n\r\nOur little span of human life is far too narrow for us to be a\r\nwitness of any of the great earth changes. These changes are so\r\nslow,--oh, so slow,--and human history is so brief. So far as we are\r\nconcerned, the gods of the earth sit in council behind closed doors.\r\nAll the profound, formative, world-shaping forces of nature go on in\r\na realm that we can reach only through our imaginations. They so far\r\ntranscend our human experiences that it requires an act of faith to\r\napprehend them. The repose of the hills and the mountains, how\r\nprofound! yet they may be rising or sinking before our very eyes,\r\nand we detect no sign. Only on exceptional occasions, during\r\nearthquakes or volcanic eruptions, is their dreamless slumber rudely\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nGeologists tell us that from the great plateau in which the Grand\r\nCanon is cut, layers of rock many thousands of feet thick were cut\r\naway before the canon was begun.\r\n\r\nStarting from the high plateau of Utah, and going south toward the\r\ncanon, we descend a grand geologic stairway, every shelf or tread of\r\nwhich consists of different formations fifty or more miles broad,\r\nfrom the Eocene, at an altitude of over ten thousand feet at the\r\nstart, across the Cretaceous, the Jurassic, the Triassic, the\r\nPermian, to the Carboniferous, which is the bottom or landing of the\r\nGrand Canon plateau at an altitude of about five thousand feet. Each\r\nstep terminates more or less abruptly, the first by a drop of eight\r\nhundred feet, ornamented by rows of square obelisks and pilasters of\r\nuniform pattern and dimension, \"giving the effect,\" says Major\r\nDutton, \"of a gigantic colonnade from which the entablature has been\r\nremoved or has fallen in ruins.\"\r\n\r\nThe next step, or platform, the Cretaceous, slopes down gradually or\r\ndies out on the step beneath it; then comes the Jurassic, which ends\r\nin white sandstone cliffs several hundred feet high; then the\r\nTriassic, which ends in the famous vermilion cliffs thousands of\r\nfeet high, most striking in color and in form; then the Permian\r\ntread, which also ends in striking cliffs, with their own style of\r\ncolor and architecture; and, lastly, the great Carboniferous\r\nplatform in which the canon itself is carved. Now, all these various\r\nstrata above the canon, making at one time a thickness of over a\r\nmile, were worn away in Pliocene times, before the cutting of the\r\nGrand Canon began. Had they remained, and been cut through, we\r\nshould have had a chasm two miles deep instead of one mile.\r\n\r\nThe cutting power of a large, rapid volume of water, like the\r\nColorado, charged with sand and gravel, is very great. According to\r\nMajor Dutton, in the hydraulic mines of California, the escaping\r\nwater has been known to cut a chasm from twelve to twenty feet deep\r\nin hard basaltic rock, in a single year. This is, of course,\r\nexceptional, but there have, no doubt, been times when the Colorado\r\ncut downward very rapidly. The enormous weathering of its side walls\r\nis to me the more wonderful, probably because the forces that have\r\nachieved this task are silent and invisible, and, so far as our\r\nexperience goes, so infinitely slow in their action. The river is a\r\ntremendous machine for grinding and sawing and transporting, but the\r\nrains and the frost and the air and the sunbeams smite the rocks as\r\nwith weapons of down, and one is naturally incredulous as to their\r\ndestructive effects.\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller rivers in the plateau region flow in very deep\r\nbut very narrow canons. The rocks being harder and more homogeneous,\r\nthe weathering has been slight. The meteoric forces have not taken a\r\nhand in the game. Thus the Parunuweap Canon is only twenty to\r\nthirty feet wide, but from six hundred to fifteen hundred feet deep.\r\n\r\nI suppose the slow, inappreciable erosion to which the old guide\r\nalluded would have cut the canon since Middle Tertiary times. The\r\nriver, eating downward at the rate of one sixteenth of an inch a\r\nyear, would do it in about one million years. At half that rate it\r\nwould do it in double that time. In the earlier part of its history,\r\nwhen the rainfall was doubtless greater, and the river fuller, the\r\nerosion must have been much more rapid than it is at present. The\r\nwidening of the canon was doubtless a slower process than the\r\ndownward cutting. But, as I have said, the downward cutting would\r\ntend to check itself from age to age, while the widening process\r\nwould go steadily forward. Hence, when we look into the great abyss,\r\nwe have only to remember the enormous length of time that the aerial\r\nand subaerial forces have been at work to account for it.\r\n\r\nTwo forces, or kinds of forces, have worked together in excavating\r\nthe canon: the river, which is the primary factor, and the meteoric\r\nforces, which may be called the secondary, as they follow in the\r\nwake of the former. The river starts the gash downward, then the\r\naerial forces begin to eat into the sides. Acting alone, the river\r\nwould cut a trench its own width, and were the rocks through which\r\nit saws one homogeneous mass, or of uniform texture and hardness,\r\nthe width of the trench would probably have been very uniform and\r\nmuch less than it is now. The condition that has contributed to its\r\ngreat width is the heterogeneity of the different formations--some\r\nhard and some soft. The softer bands, of course, introduce the\r\nelement of weakness. They decay and crumble the more rapidly, and\r\nthus undermine the harder bands overlying them, which, by reason of\r\ntheir vertical fractures, break off and fall to the bottom, where\r\nthey are exposed to the action of floods and are sooner or later\r\nground up in the river's powerful maw. Hence the recession of the\r\nbanks of the canon has gone steadily on with the downward cutting of\r\nthe river. Where the rock is homogeneous, as it is in the inner\r\nchasm of the dark gneiss, the widening process seems to have gone on\r\nmuch more slowly. Geologists account for the great width of the main\r\nchasm when compared with the depth, on the theory that the forces\r\nthat work laterally have been more continuously active than has the\r\nforce that cuts downward. There is convincing evidence that the\r\nwhole region has been many times lifted up since the cutting began,\r\nso that the river has had its active and passive stages. As its\r\nchannel approached the sea level, its current would be much less\r\nrapid, and the downward cutting would practically cease, till the\r\nsection was elevated again. But all the time the forces working\r\nlaterally would be at work without interruption, and would thus gain\r\non their checked brethren of the river bottom.\r\n\r\nThere is probably another explanation of what we see here. Apart\r\nfrom the mechanical weathering of the rocks as a result of the arid\r\nclimate, wherein rapid and often extreme changes of temperature take\r\nplace, causing the surface of the rocks to flake or scale off, there\r\nhas doubtless been unusual chemical weathering, and this has been\r\nlargely brought about by the element of iron that all these rocks\r\npossess. Their many brilliant colors are imparted to them by the\r\nvarious compounds of iron which enter into their composition. And\r\niron, though the symbol of hardness and strength, is an element of\r\nweakness in rocks, as it causes them to oxidize or disintegrate more\r\nrapidly. In the marble canon, where apparently the rock contains no\r\niron, the lateral erosion has been very little, though the river has\r\ncut a trench as deep as it has in other parts of its course.\r\n\r\nHow often I thought during those days at the canon of the geology of\r\nmy native hills amid the Catskills, which show the effects of\r\ndenudation as much older than that shown here as this is older than\r\nthe washout in the road by this morning's shower! The old red\r\nsandstone in which I hoed corn as a farm-boy dates back to Middle\r\nPalaeozoic time, or to the spring of the great geologic year, while\r\nthe canon is of the late autumn. Could my native hills have replied\r\nto my mute questionings, they would have said: \"We were old, old,\r\nand had passed through the canon stage long before the Grand Canon\r\nwas born. We have had all that experience, and have forgotten it\r\nages ago. No vestiges of our canons remain. They have all been worn\r\ndown and obliterated by the strokes of a hand as gentle as that of a\r\npassing cloud. Where they were, are now broad, fertile valleys, with\r\nrounded knolls and gentle slopes, and the sound of peaceful\r\nhusbandry. The great ice sheet rubbed us and ploughed us, but our\r\ncontours were gentle and rounded aeons before that event. When the\r\nGrand Canon is as old as we are, all its superb architectural\r\nfeatures will have long since disappeared, its gigantic walls will\r\nhave crumbled, and rolling plains and gentle valleys will have taken\r\nits place.\" All of which seems quite probable. With time enough, the\r\ngentle forces of air and water will surely change the whole aspect\r\nof this tremendous chasm.\r\n\r\nOn the second day we made the descent into the canon on mule-back.\r\nThere is always satisfaction in going to the bottom of things. Then\r\nwe wanted to get on more intimate terms with the great abyss, to\r\nwrestle with it, if need be, and to feel its power, as well as to\r\nbehold it. It is not best always to dwell upon the rim of things or\r\nto look down upon them from afar. The summits are good, but the\r\nvalleys have their charm, also; even the valley of humiliation has\r\nits lessons. At any rate, four of us were unanimous in our desire to\r\nsound that vast profound on mule-back, trusting that the return trip\r\nwould satisfy our \"climbing\" aspirations, as it did.\r\n\r\nIt is quite worth while to go down into the canon on mule-back, if\r\nonly to fall in love with a mule, and to learn what a sure-footed,\r\ncareful, and docile creature, when he is on his good behavior, a\r\nmule can be. My mule was named \"Johnny,\" and there was soon a good\r\nunderstanding between us. I quickly learned to turn the whole\r\nproblem of that perilous descent over to him. He knew how to take\r\nthe sharp turns and narrow shelves of that steep zigzag much better\r\nthan I did. I do not fancy that the thought of my safety was\r\n\"Johnny's\" guiding star; his solicitude struck nearer home than\r\nthat. There was much ice and snow on the upper part of the trail,\r\nand only those slender little legs of \"Johnny's\" stood between me\r\nand a tumble of two or three thousand feet. How cautiously he felt\r\nhis way with his round little feet, as, with lowered head, he seemed\r\nto be scanning the trail critically! Only when he swung around the\r\nsharp elbows of the trail did his forefeet come near the edge of the\r\nbrink. Only once or twice at such times, as we hung for a breath\r\nabove the terrible incline, did I feel a slight shudder. One of my\r\ncompanions, who had never before been upon an animal's back, so fell\r\nin love with her \"Sandy\" that she longed for a trunk big enough in\r\nwhich to take him home with her.\r\n\r\nIt was more than worth while to make the descent to traverse that\r\nCambrian plateau, which from the rim is seen to flow out from the\r\nbase of the enormous cliffs to the brink of the inner chasm, looking\r\nlike some soft, lavender-colored carpet or rug. I had never seen the\r\nCambrian rocks, the lowest of the stratified formations, nor set my\r\nfoot upon Cambrian soil. Hence a new experience was promised me.\r\nRocky layers probably two or three miles thick had been worn away\r\nfrom the old Cambrian foundations, and when I looked down upon that\r\ngently undulating plateau, the thought of the eternity of time which\r\nit represented tended quite as much to make me dizzy as did the drop\r\nof nearly four thousand feet. We found it gravelly and desert-like,\r\ncovered with cacti, low sagebrush, and other growths. The dim trail\r\nled us to its edge, where we could look down into the\r\ntwelve-hundred-foot V-shaped gash which the river had cut into the\r\ndark, crude-looking Archaean rock. How distinctly it looked like a\r\nnew day in creation where the horizontal, yellowish-gray beds of the\r\nCambrian were laid down upon the dark, amorphous, and twisted older\r\ngranite! How carefully the level strata had been fitted to the\r\nshapeless mass beneath it! It all looked like the work of a master\r\nmason; apparently you could put the point of your knife where one\r\nended and the other began. The older rock suggested chaos and\r\nturmoil; the other suggested order and plan, as if the builder had\r\nsaid, \"Now upon this foundation we will build our house.\" It is an\r\ninteresting fact, the full geologic significance of which I suppose\r\nI do not appreciate, that the different formations are usually\r\nmarked off from one another in just this sharp way, as if each one\r\nwas, indeed, the work of a separate day of creation. Nature appears\r\nat long intervals to turn over a new leaf and start a new chapter in\r\nher great book. The transition from one geologic age to another\r\nappears to be abrupt: new colors, new constituents, new qualities\r\nappear in the rocks with a suddenness hard to reconcile with Lyell's\r\ndoctrine of uniformitarianism, just as new species appear in the\r\nlife of the globe with an abruptness hard to reconcile with Darwin's\r\nslow process of natural selection. Is sudden mutation, after all,\r\nthe key to all these phenomena?\r\n\r\nWe ate our lunch on the old Cambrian table, placed there for us so\r\nlong ago, and gazed down upon the turbulent river hiding and\r\nreappearing in its labyrinthian channel so far below us. It is worth\r\nwhile to make the descent in order to look upon the river which has\r\nbeen the chief quarryman in excavating the canon, and to find how\r\ninadequate it looks for the work ascribed to it. Viewed from where\r\nwe sat, I judged it to be forty or fifty feet broad, but I was\r\nassured that it was between two and three hundred feet. Water and\r\nsand are ever symbols of instability and inconstancy, but let them\r\nwork together, and they saw through mountains, and undermine the\r\nfoundations of the hills.\r\n\r\nIt is always worth while to sit or kneel at the feet of grandeur, to\r\nlook up into the placid faces of the earth gods and feel their\r\npower, and the tourist who goes down into the canon certainly has\r\nthis privilege. We did not bring back in our hands, or in our hats,\r\nthe glory that had lured us from the top, but we seemed to have been\r\nnearer its sources, and to have brought back a deepened sense of the\r\nmagnitude of the forms, and of the depth of the chasm which we had\r\nheretofore gazed upon from a distance. Also we had plucked the\r\nflower of safety from the nettle danger, always an exhilarating\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIn climbing back, my eye, now sharpened by my geologic reading,\r\ndwelt frequently and long upon the horizon where that cross-bedded\r\nCarboniferous sandstone joins the Carboniferous limestone above it.\r\nHow much older the sandstone looked! I could not avoid the\r\nimpression that its surface must have formed a plane of erosion ages\r\nand ages before the limestone had been laid down upon it.\r\n\r\nWe had left plenty of ice and snow at the top, but in the bottom we\r\nfound the early spring flowers blooming, and a settler at what is\r\ncalled the Indian Gardens was planting his garden. Here I heard the\r\nsong of the canon wren, a new and very pleasing bird-song to me. I\r\nthink our dreams were somewhat disturbed that night by the\r\nimpressions of the day, but our day-dreams since that time have at\r\nleast been sweeter and more comforting, and I am sure that the\r\nremainder of our lives will be the richer for our having seen the\r\nGrand Canon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE SPELL OF THE YOSEMITE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYosemite won my heart at once, as it seems to win the hearts of all\r\nwho visit it. In my case many things helped to do it, but I am sure\r\na robin, the first I had seen since leaving home, did his part. He\r\nstruck the right note, he brought the scene home to me, he supplied\r\nthe link of association. There he was, running over the grass or\r\nperching on the fence, or singing from a tree-top in the old\r\nfamiliar way. Where the robin is at home, there at home am I. But\r\nmany other things helped to win my heart to the Yosemite--the whole\r\ncharacter of the scene, not only its beauty and sublimity, but the\r\nair of peace and protection, and of homelike seclusion that pervades\r\nit; the charm of a nook, a retreat, combined with the power and\r\ngrandeur of nature in her sternest moods.\r\n\r\nAfter passing from the hotel at El Portal along the foaming and\r\nroaring Merced River, and amid the tumbled confusion of enormous\r\ngranite boulders shaken down from the cliffs above, you cross the\r\nthreshold of the great valley as into some vast house or hall carved\r\nout of the mountains, and at once feel the spell of the brooding\r\ncalm and sheltered seclusion that pervades it. You pass suddenly\r\nfrom the tumultuous, the chaotic, into the ordered, the tranquil,\r\nthe restful, which seems enhanced by the power and grandeur that\r\nencompass them about. You can hardly be prepared for the hush that\r\nsuddenly falls upon the river and for the gentle rural and sylvan\r\ncharacter of much that surrounds you; the peace of the fields, the\r\nseclusion of the woods, the privacy of sunny glades, the enchantment\r\nof falls and lucid waters, with a touch of human occupancy here and\r\nthere--all this, set in that enormous granite frame, three or four\r\nthousand feet high, ornamented with domes and spires and peaks still\r\nhigher,--it is all this that wins your heart and fills your\r\nimagination in the Yosemite.\r\n\r\nAs you ride or walk along the winding road up the level valley amid\r\nthe noble pines and spruces and oaks, and past the groves and bits\r\nof meadow and the camps of many tents, and the huge mossy granite\r\nboulders here and there reposing in the shade of the trees, with the\r\nfull, clear, silent river winding through the plain near you, you\r\nare all the time aware of those huge vertical walls, their faces\r\nscarred and niched, streaked with color, or glistening with\r\nmoisture, and animated with waterfalls, rising up on either hand,\r\nthousands of feet high, not architectural, or like something\r\nbuilded, but like the sides and the four corners of the globe\r\nitself. What an impression of mass and of power and of grandeur in\r\nrepose filters into you as you walk along! El Capitan stands there\r\nshowing its simple sweeping lines through the trees as you approach,\r\nlike one of the veritable pillars of the firmament. How long we are\r\nnearing it and passing it! It is so colossal that it seems near\r\nwhile it is yet far off. It is so simple that the eye takes in its\r\nnaked grandeur at a glance. It demands of you a new standard of size\r\nwhich you cannot at once produce. It is as clean and smooth as the\r\nflank of a horse, and as poised and calm as a Greek statue. It\r\ncurves out toward the base as if planted there to resist the\r\npressure of worlds--probably the most majestic single granite\r\ncolumn or mountain buttress on the earth. Its summit is over three\r\nthousand feet above you. Across the valley, nearly opposite, rise\r\nthe Cathedral Rocks to nearly the same height, while farther along,\r\nbeyond El Capitan, the Three Brothers shoulder the sky at about the\r\nsame dizzy height. Near the head of the great valley, North Dome,\r\nperfect in outline as if turned in a lathe, and its brother, the\r\nHalf Dome (or shall we say half-brother?) across the valley, look\r\ndown upon Mirror Lake from an altitude of over four thousand feet.\r\nThese domes suggest enormous granite bubbles if such were possible\r\npushed up from below and retaining their forms through the vast\r\ngeologic ages. Of course they must have weathered enormously, but as\r\nthe rock seems to peel off in concentric sheets, their forms are\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne warm, bright Sunday near the end of April, six of us walked up\r\nfrom the hotel to Vernal and Nevada Falls, or as near to them as we\r\ncould get, and took our fill of the tumult of foaming waters\r\nstruggling with the wreck of huge granite cliffs: so impassive and\r\nimmobile the rocks, so impetuous and reckless and determined the\r\nonset of the waters, till the falls are reached, when the obstructed\r\nriver seems to find the escape and the freedom it was so eagerly\r\nseeking. Better to be completely changed into foam and spray by one\r\nsingle leap of six hundred feet into empty space, the river seems to\r\nsay, than be forever baffled and tortured and torn on this rack of\r\nmerciless boulders.\r\n\r\nWe followed the zigzagging trail up the steep side of the valley,\r\ntouching melting snow-banks in its upper courses, passing huge\r\ngranite rocks also melting in the slow heat of the geologic ages,\r\npausing to take in the rugged, shaggy spruces and pines that\r\nsentineled the mountain-sides here and there, or resting our eyes\r\nupon Liberty Cap, which carries its suggestive form a thousand feet\r\nor more above the Nevada Fall. What beauty, what grandeur attended\r\nus that day! the wild tumult of waters, the snow-white falls, the\r\nmotionless avalanches of granite rocks, and the naked granite shaft,\r\nLiberty Cap, dominating all!\r\n\r\nAnd that night, too, when we sat around a big camp-fire near our\r\ntents in the valley, and saw the full moon come up and look down\r\nupon us from behind Sentinel Rock, and heard the intermittent\r\nbooming of Yosemite Falls sifting through the spruce trees that\r\ntowered around us, and felt the tender, brooding spirit of the great\r\nvalley, itself touched to lyric intensity by the grandeurs on every\r\nhand, steal in upon us, and possess our souls--surely that was a\r\nnight none of us can ever forget. As Yosemite can stand the broad,\r\nsearching light of midday and not be cheapened, so its enchantments\r\ncan stand the light of the moon and the stars and not be rendered\r\ntoo vague and impalpable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing from the Grand Canon to Yosemite is going from one sublimity\r\nto another of a different order. The canon is the more strange,\r\nunearthly, apocryphal, appeals more to the imagination, and is the\r\nmore overwhelming in its size, its wealth of color, and its\r\nmultitude of suggestive forms. But for quiet majesty and beauty,\r\nwith a touch of the sylvan and pastoral, too, Yosemite stands alone.\r\nOne could live with Yosemite, camp in it, tramp in it, winter and\r\nsummer in it, and find nature in her tender and human, almost\r\ndomestic moods, as well as in her grand and austere. But I do not\r\nthink one could ever feel at home in or near the Grand Canon; it is\r\ntoo unlike anything we have ever known upon the earth; it is like a\r\nvision of some strange colossal city uncovered from the depth of\r\ngeologic time. You may have come to it, as we did, from the\r\nPetrified Forests, where you saw the silicified trunks of thousands\r\nof gigantic trees or tree ferns, that grew millions of years ago,\r\nmost of them uncovered, but many of them protruding from banks of\r\nclay and gravel, and in their interiors rich in all the colors of\r\nthe rainbow, and you wonder if you may not now be gazing upon some\r\npetrified antediluvian city of temples and holy places exhumed by\r\nmysterious hands and opened up to the vulgar gaze of to-day. You\r\nlook into it from above and from another world and you descend into\r\nit at your peril. Yosemite you enter as into a gigantic hall and\r\nmake your own; the canon you gaze down upon, and are an alien,\r\nwhether you enter it or not. Yosemite is carved out of the most\r\nmajestic and enduring of all rocks, granite; the Grand Canon is\r\ncarved out of one of the most beautiful, but perishable, red\r\nCarboniferous sandstone and limestone. There is a maze of beautiful\r\nand intricate lines in the latter, a wilderness of temple-like forms\r\nand monumental remains, and noble architectural profiles that\r\ndelight while they bewilder the eye. Yosemite has much greater\r\nsimplicity, and is much nearer the classic standard of beauty. Its\r\ngrand and austere features predominate, of course, but underneath\r\nthese and adorning them are many touches of the idyllic and the\r\npicturesque. Its many waterfalls fluttering like white lace against\r\nits vertical granite walls, its smooth, level floor, its noble pines\r\nand oaks, its open glades, its sheltering groves, its bright, clear,\r\nwinding river, its soft voice of many waters, its flowers, its\r\nbirds, its grass, its verdure, even its orchards of blooming apple\r\ntrees, all inclosed in this tremendous granite frame--what an\r\nunforgettable picture it all makes, what a blending of the sublime\r\nand the homelike and familiar it all is! It is the waterfalls that\r\nmake the granite alive, and bursting into bloom as it were. What a\r\ntouch they give! how they enliven the scene! What music they evoke\r\nfrom these harps of stone!\r\n\r\nThe first leap of Yosemite Falls is sixteen hundred feet--sixteen\r\nhundred feet of a compact mass of snowy rockets shooting downward\r\nand bursting into spray around which rainbows flit and hover. The\r\nnext leap is four hundred feet, and the last six hundred. We tried\r\nto get near the foot and inspect the hidden recess in which this\r\nairy spirit again took on a more tangible form of still, running\r\nwater, but the spray over a large area fell like a summer shower,\r\ndrenching the trees and the rocks, and holding the inquisitive\r\ntourist off at a safe distance. We had to beat a retreat with\r\ndripping garments before we had got within fifty yards of the foot\r\nof the fall. At first I was surprised at the volume of water that\r\ncame hurrying out of the hidden recess of dripping rocks and\r\ntrees--a swiftly flowing stream, thirty or forty feet wide, and four\r\nor five feet deep. How could that comparatively narrow curtain of\r\nwhite spray up there give birth to such a full robust stream? But I\r\nsaw that in making the tremendous leap from the top of the\r\nprecipice, the stream was suddenly drawn out, as we stretch a rubber\r\nband in our hands, and that the solid and massive current below was\r\nlike the rubber again relaxed. The strain was over, and the united\r\nwaters deepened and slowed up over their rocky bed.\r\n\r\nYosemite for a home or a camp, the Grand Canon for a spectacle. I\r\nhave spoken of the robin I saw in Yosemite Valley. Think how forlorn\r\nand out of place a robin would seem in the Grand Canon! What would\r\nhe do there? There is no turf for him to inspect, and there are no\r\ntrees for him to perch on. I should as soon expect to find him amid\r\nthe pyramids of Egypt, or amid the ruins of Karnak. The bluebird was\r\nin the Yosemite also, and the water-ouzel haunted the lucid waters.\r\n\r\nI noticed a peculiarity of the oak in Yosemite that I never saw\r\nelsewhere [Footnote: I have since observed the same trait in the\r\noaks in Georgia--probably a characteristic of this tree in southern\r\nlatitudes.]--a fluid or outflowing condition of the growth\r\naboveground, such as one usually sees in the roots of trees--so that\r\nit tended to envelop and swallow, as it were, any solid object with\r\nwhich it came in contact. If its trunk touched a point of rock, it\r\nwould put out great oaken lips several inches in extent as if to\r\ndraw the rock into its maw. If a dry limb was cut or broken off, a\r\nfoot from the trunk, these thin oaken lips would slowly creep out\r\nand envelop it--a sort of Western omnivorous trait appearing in the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nWhitman refers to \"the slumbering and liquid trees.\" These Yosemite\r\noaks recall his expression more surely than any of our Eastern\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe reader may create for himself a good image of Yosemite by\r\nthinking of a section of seven or eight miles of the Hudson River,\r\nmidway of its course, as emptied of its water and deepened three\r\nthousand feet or more, having the sides nearly vertical, with\r\nsnow-white waterfalls fluttering against them here and there, the\r\nfamous spires and domes planted along the rim, and the landscape of\r\ngroves and glades, with its still, clear winding river, occupying\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne cannot look upon Yosemite or walk beneath its towering walls\r\nwithout the question arising in his mind, How did all this happen?\r\nWhat were the agents that brought it about? There has been a great\r\ngeologic drama enacted here; who or what were the star actors? There\r\nare two other valleys in this part of the Sierra, Hetch-Hetchy and\r\nKing's River, that are almost identical in their main features,\r\nthough the Merced Yosemite is the widest of the three. Each of them\r\nis a tremendous chasm in the granite rock, with nearly vertical\r\nwalls, domes, El Capitans, and Sentinel and Cathedral Rocks, and\r\nwaterfalls--all modeled on the same general plan. I believe there\r\nis nothing just like this trio of Yosemites anywhere else on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nGuided by one's ordinary sense or judgment alone, one's judgment as\r\ndeveloped and disciplined by the everyday affairs of life and the\r\neveryday course of nature, one would say on beholding Yosemite that\r\nhere is the work of exceptional and extraordinary agents or\r\nworld-building forces. It is as surprising and exceptional as would\r\nbe a cathedral in a village street, or a gigantic sequoia in a grove\r\nof our balsam firs. The approach to it up the Merced River does not\r\nprepare one for any such astonishing spectacle as awaits one. The\r\nrushing, foaming water amid the tumbled confusion of huge granite\r\nrocks and the open V-shaped valley, are nothing very remarkable or\r\nunusual. Then suddenly you are on the threshold of this hall of the\r\nelder gods. Demons and furies might lurk in the valley below, but\r\nhere is the abode of the serene, beneficent Olympian deities. All is\r\nso calm, so hushed, so friendly, yet so towering, so stupendous, so\r\nunspeakably beautiful. You are in a mansion carved out of the\r\ngranite foundations of the earth, with walls two or three thousand\r\nfeet high, hung here and there with snow-white waterfalls, and\r\nsupporting the blue sky on domes and pinnacles still higher. Oh, the\r\ncalmness and majesty of the scene! the evidence of such tremendous\r\nactivity of some force, some agent, and now so tranquil, so\r\nsheltering, so beneficent!\r\n\r\nThat there should be two or three Yosemites in the Sierra not very\r\nfar apart, all with the main features singularly alike, is very\r\nsignificant--as if this kind of valley was latent in the granite of\r\nthat region--some peculiarity of rock structure that lends itself\r\nreadily to these formations. The Sierra lies beyond the southern\r\nlimit of the great continental ice-sheet of late Tertiary times, but\r\nit nursed and reared many local glaciers, and to the eroding power\r\nof these its Yosemites are partly due. But water was at work here\r\nlong before the ice--eating down into the granite and laying open\r\nthe mountain for the ice to begin its work. Ice may come, and ice\r\nmay go, says the river, but I go on forever. Water tends to make a\r\nV-shaped valley, ice a U-shaped one, though in the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nwhere water erosion alone has taken place, the prevailing form of\r\nthe valleys is that of the U-shaped. Yosemite approximates to this\r\nshape, and ice has certainly played a part in its formation. But the\r\nglacier seems to have stopped at the outlet of the great valley; it\r\ndid not travel beyond the gigantic hall it had helped to excavate.\r\nThe valley of the Merced from the mouth of Yosemite downward is an\r\nopen valley strewn with huge angular granite rocks and shows no\r\nsigns of glaciation whatever. The reason of this abruptness is quite\r\nbeyond my ken. It is to me a plausible theory that when the granite\r\nthat forms the Sierra was lifted or squeezed up by the shrinking of\r\nthe earth, large fissures and crevasses may have occurred, and that\r\nYosemite and kindred valleys may be the result of the action of\r\nwater and ice in enlarging these original chasms. Little wonder that\r\nthe earlier geologists, such as Whitney, were led to attribute the\r\nexceptional character of these valleys to exceptional and\r\nextraordinary agents--to sudden faulting or dislocation of the\r\nearth's crust. But geologists are becoming more and more loath to\r\ncall in the cataclysmal to explain any feature of the topography of\r\nthe land. Not to the thunder or the lightning, to earthquake or\r\nvolcano, to the forces of upheaval or dislocation, but to the still,\r\nsmall voice of the rain and the winds, of the frost and the\r\nsnow,--the gentle forces now and here active all about us, carving\r\nthe valleys and reducing the mountains, and changing the courses of\r\nrivers,--to these, as Lyell taught us, we are to look in nine cases\r\nout of ten, yes, in ninety-nine out of a hundred, to account for the\r\nconfiguration of the continents.\r\n\r\nThe geologists of our day, while not agreeing as to the amount of\r\nwork done respectively by ice and water, yet agree that to the\r\nlatter the larger proportion of the excavation is to be ascribed. At\r\nany rate between them both they have turned out one of the most\r\nbeautiful and stupendous pieces of mountain carving to be found upon\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE EYES OF THE GEOLOGIST\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow habitually we go about over the surface of the earth, delving it\r\nor cultivating it or leveling it, without thinking that it has not\r\nalways been as we now find it, that the mountains were not always\r\nmountains, nor the valleys always valleys, nor the plains always\r\nplains, nor the sand always sand, nor the clay always clay. Our\r\nexperience goes but a little way in such matters. Such a thought\r\ntakes us from human time to God's time, from the horizon of place\r\nand years to the horizon of geologic ages. We go about our little\r\naffairs in the world, sowing and reaping and building and\r\njourneying, like children playing through the halls of their\r\nancestors, without pausing to ask how these things all came about.\r\nWe do not reflect upon the age of our fields any more than we do\r\nupon the size of the globe under our feet: when we become curious\r\nabout such matters and look upon the mountains as either old or\r\nyoung, or as the subjects of birth, growth, and decay, then we are\r\nunconscious geologists. It is to our interest in such things that\r\ngeology appeals and it is this interest that it stimulates and\r\nguides.\r\n\r\nWhat an astonishing revelation, for instance, that the soil was born\r\nof the rocks, and is still born of the rocks; that every particle of\r\nit was once locked up in the primitive granite and was unlocked by\r\nthe slow action of the rain and the dews and the snows; that the\r\nrocky ribs of the earth were clothed with this fertile soil out of\r\nwhich we came and to which we return by their own decay; that the\r\npulling-down of the inorganic meant the building-up of the organic;\r\nthat the death of the crystal meant the birth of the cell, and\r\nindirectly of you and me and of all that lives upon the earth.\r\n\r\nHad there been no soil, had the rocks not decayed, there had been no\r\nyou and me. Such considerations have long made me feel a keen\r\ninterest in geology, and especially of late years have stimulated my\r\ndesire to try to see the earth as the geologist sees it. I have\r\nalways had a good opinion of the ground underfoot, out of which we\r\nall come, and to which we all return; and the story the geologists\r\ntell us about it is calculated to enhance greatly that good opinion.\r\n\r\nI think that if I could be persuaded, as my fathers were, that the\r\nworld was made in six days, by the fiat of a supernatural power, I\r\nshould soon lose my interest in it. Such an account of it takes it\r\nout of the realm of human interest, because it takes it out of the\r\nrealm of natural causation, and places it in the realm of the\r\narbitrary, and non-natural. But to know that it was not made at all,\r\nin the mechanical sense, but that it grew--that it is an evolution\r\nas much as the life upon the surface, that it has an almost infinite\r\npast, that it has been developing and ripening for millions upon\r\nmillions of years, a veritable apple upon the great sidereal tree,\r\nameliorating from cycle to cycle, mellowing, coloring,\r\nsweetening--why, such a revelation adds immensely to our interest in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs with nearly everything else, the wonder of the world grows the\r\nmore we grasp its history. The wonder of life grows the more we\r\nconsider the chaos of fire and death out of which it came; the\r\nwonder of man grows the more we peer into the abyss of geologic time\r\nand of low bestial life out of which he came.\r\n\r\nNot a tree, not a shrub, not a flower, not a green thing growing,\r\nnot an insect of an hour, but has a background of a vast aeon of\r\ngeologic and astronomic time, out of which the forces that shaped it\r\nhave emerged, and over which the powers of chaos and darkness have\r\nfailed to prevail.\r\n\r\nThe modern geologist affords us one of the best illustrations of the\r\nuses of the scientific imagination that we can turn to. The\r\nscientific imagination seems to be about the latest phase of the\r\nevolution of the human mind. This power of interpretation of\r\nconcrete facts, this Miltonic flight into time and space, into the\r\nheavens above, and into the bowels of the earth beneath, and bodying\r\nforth a veritable history, a warring of the powers of light and\r\ndarkness, with the triumph of the angels of light and life, makes\r\nMilton's picture seem hollow and unreal. The creative and poetic\r\nimagination has undoubtedly already reached its high-water mark. We\r\nshall probably never see the great imaginative works of the past\r\nsurpassed or even equaled. But in the world of scientific discovery\r\nand interpretation, we see the imagination working in new fields and\r\nunder new conditions, and achieving triumphs that mark a new epoch\r\nin the history of the race. Nature, which once terrified man and\r\nmade a coward of him, now inspires him and fills him with love and\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe geologist is the interpreter of the records of the rocks. From a\r\nbit of strata here, and a bit there, he re-creates the earth as it\r\nwas in successive geologic periods, as Cuvier reconstructed his\r\nextinct animals from fragments of their bones; and the same\r\ninterpretative power of the imagination is called into play in both\r\ncases, only the palaeontologist has a much narrower field to work\r\nin, and the background of his re-creations must be supplied by the\r\ngeologist.\r\n\r\nEverything connected with the history of the earth is on such a vast\r\nscale--such a scale of time, such a scale of power, such a scale of\r\nmovement--that in trying to measure it by our human standards and\r\nexperience we are like the proverbial child with his cup on the\r\nseashore. Looked at from our point of view, the great geological\r\nprocesses often seem engaged in world-destruction rather than in\r\nworld-building. Those oft-repeated invasions of the continents by\r\nthe ocean, which have gone on from Archaean times, and during which\r\nvast areas which had been dry land for ages were engulfed, seem like\r\nworld-wide catastrophes. And no doubt they were such to myriads of\r\nplants and animals of those times. But this is the way the\r\ncontinents grew. All the forces of the invading waters were engaged\r\nin making more land.\r\n\r\nThe geologist is bold; he is made so by the facts and processes with\r\nwhich he deals; his daring affirmations are inspired by a study of\r\nthe features of the earth about him; his time is not our time, his\r\nhorizons are not our horizons; he escapes from our human experiences\r\nand standards into the vast out-of-doors of the geologic forces and\r\ngeologic ages. The text he deciphers is written large, written\r\nacross the face of the continent, written in mountain-chains and\r\nocean depths, and in the piled strata of the globe. We untrained\r\nobservers cannot spell out these texts, because they are written\r\nlarge; our vision is adjusted to smaller print; we are like the\r\nschool-boy who finds on the map the name of a town or a river, but\r\ndoes not see the name of the state or the continent printed across\r\nit. If the geologist did not tell us, how should we ever suspect\r\nthat probably where we now stand two or more miles of strata have\r\nbeen worn away by the winds and rains; that the soil of our garden,\r\nour farm, represents the ashes of mountains burned up in the slow\r\nfires of the geologic ages.\r\n\r\nGeology first gives us an adequate conception of time. The\r\nlimitations which shut our fathers into the narrow close of six\r\nthousand years are taken down by this great science and we are\r\nturned out into the open of unnumbered millions of years. Upon the\r\nbackground of geologic time our chronological time shows no more\r\nthan a speck upon the sky. The whole of human history is but a mere\r\nfraction of a degree of this mighty arc. The Christian era would\r\nmake but a few seconds of the vast cycle of the earth's history.\r\nGeologic time! The words seem to ring down through the rocky strata\r\nof the earth's crust; they reverberate under the mountains, and make\r\nthem rise and fall like the waves of the sea; they open up vistas\r\nthrough which we behold the continents and the oceans changing\r\nplaces, and the climates of the globe shifting like clouds in the\r\nsky; whole races and tribes of animal forms disappear and new ones\r\ncome upon the scene. Such a past! the imagination can barely skirt\r\nthe edge of it. As the pool in the field is to the sea that wraps\r\nthe earth, so is the time of our histories to the cycle of ages in\r\nwhich the geologist reckons the events of the earth's history.\r\n\r\nThrough the eyes of the geologist one may look upon his native hills\r\nand see them as they were incalculable ages ago, and as they\r\nprobably will be incalculable ages ahead; those hills, so unchanging\r\nduring his lifetime, and during a thousand lifetimes, he may see as\r\nflitting as the cloud shadows upon the landscape. Out of the dark\r\nabyss of geologic time there come stalking the ghosts of lost\r\nmountains and lost hills and valleys and plains, or lost rivers and\r\nlakes, yea, of lost continents; we see a procession of the phantoms\r\nof strange and monstrous beasts, many of them colossal in size and\r\nfearful in form, and among the minor forms of this fearful troop of\r\nspectres we see the ones that carried safely forward, through the\r\nvicissitudes of those ages, the precious impulse that was to\r\neventuate in the human race.\r\n\r\nOnly the geologist knows the part played by erosion in shaping the\r\nearth's surface as we see it. He sees, I repeat, the phantoms of\r\nvanished hills and mountains all about us. He sees their shadow\r\nforms wherever he looks. He follows out the lines of the flexed or\r\nfolded strata where they come to the surface, and thus sketches in\r\nthe air the elevation that has disappeared. In some places he finds\r\nthat the valleys have become hills and the hills have become\r\nvalleys, or that the anticlines and synclines, as he calls them,\r\nhave changed places--as a result of the unequal hardness of the\r\nrocks. Over all the older parts of the country the original features\r\nhave been so changed by erosion that, could they be suddenly\r\nrestored, one would be lost on his home farm. The rocks have melted\r\ninto soil, as the snow-banks in spring melt into water. The rocks\r\nthat remain are like fragments of snow or ice that have so far\r\nwithstood the weather. Geologists tell us that the great Appalachian\r\nchain has been in the course of the ages reduced almost to a base\r\nlevel or peneplain, and then reelevated and its hills and mountains\r\ncarved out anew.\r\n\r\nWe change the surface of the earth a little with our engineering,\r\ndrain a marsh, level a hill, sweep away a forest, or bore a\r\nmountain, but what are these compared with the changes that have\r\ngone on there before our race was heard of? In my native mountains,\r\nthe Catskills, all those peaceful pastoral valleys, with their farms\r\nand homesteads, lie two or three thousand feet below the original\r\nsurface of the land. Could the land be restored again to its first\r\ncondition in Devonian times, probably the fields where I hoed corn\r\nand potatoes as a boy would be buried one or two miles beneath the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe Catskills are residual mountains, or what Agassiz calls\r\n\"denudation mountains.\" When we look at them with the eye of the\r\ngeologist we see the great plateau of tableland of Devonian times\r\nout of which they were carved by the slow action of the sub-aerial\r\nforces. They are like the little ridges and mounds of soil that\r\nremain of your garden-patch after the waters of a cloudburst have\r\nswept over it. They are immeasurably old, but they do not look it,\r\nexcept to the eye of the geologist. There is nothing decrepit in\r\ntheir appearance, nothing broken, or angular, or gaunt, or rawboned.\r\nTheir long, easy, flowing lines, their broad, smooth backs, their\r\ndeep, wide, gently sloping valleys, all help to give them a look of\r\nrepose and serenity, as if the fret and fever of life were long\r\nsince passed with them. Compared with the newer mountains of uplift\r\nin the West, they are like cattle lying down and ruminating in the\r\nfield beside alert wild steers with rigid limbs and tossing horns.\r\nThey sleep and dream with bowed heads upon the landscape. Their\r\ngreat flanks and backs are covered with a deep soil that nourishes a\r\nvery even growth of beech, birch, and maple forests. Though so old,\r\ntheir tranquillity never seems to have been disturbed; no\r\nstorm-and-stress period has left its mark upon them. Their strata\r\nall lie horizontal just as they were laid down in the old seas, and\r\nnothing but the slow gentle passage of the hand of time shows in\r\ntheir contours. Mountains of peace and repose, hills and valleys\r\nwith the flowing lines of youth, coming down to us from the fore-\r\nworld of Palaeozoic time, yet only rounded and mellowed by the aeons\r\nthey have passed through. Old, oh, so old, but young with verdure\r\nand limpid streams, and the pastoral spirit of to-day!\r\n\r\nTo the geologist most mountains are short-lived. When he finds great\r\nsturdy ranges, like the Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, he knows\r\nthey are young,--mere boys. When they get old, they will be cut\r\ndown, and their pride and glory gone. A few more of these geologic\r\nyears and they will be reduced to a peneplain,--only their stumps\r\nleft. This seems to hold truer of mountains that are wrinkles in the\r\nearth's crust--squeezed up and crumpled stratified rock, such as\r\nmost of the great mountain-systems are--than of mountains of\r\nerosion like the Catskills, or of upheaval like the Adirondacks. The\r\ncrushed and folded and dislocated strata are laid open to the\r\nweather as the horizontal strata, and as the upheaved masses of\r\nArchaean rock are not. Moreover, strata of unequal hardness are\r\nexposed, and this condition favors rapid erosion.\r\n\r\nIn imagination the geologist is present at the birth of whole\r\nmountain-ranges. He sees them gestating in the womb of their mother,\r\nthe sea. Where our great Appalachian range now stands, he sees, in\r\nthe great interior sea of Palaeozoic time, what he calls a\r\n\"geosyncline,\" a vast trough, or cradle, being slowly filled with\r\nsediment brought down by the rivers from the adjoining shores. These\r\nsediments accumulate to the enormous depth of twenty-five thousand\r\nfeet, and harden into rock. Then in the course of time they are\r\nsqueezed together and forced up by the contraction of the earth's\r\ncrust, and thus the Appalachians are born. When Mother Earth takes a\r\nnew hitch in her belt, her rocky garment takes on new wrinkles. Just\r\nwhy the earth's crust should wrinkle along lines of rock of such\r\nenormous thickness is not a little puzzling. But we are told it is\r\nbecause this heavy mass of sediment presses the sea-bottom down till\r\nthe rocks are fused by the internal heat of the earth and thus a\r\nline of weakness is established. In any case the earth's forces act\r\nas a whole, and the earth's crust at the thickest points is so\r\ncomparatively thin--probably not much more than a heavy sheet of\r\ncardboard over a six-inch globe--that these forces seem to go their\r\nown way regardless of such minor differences.\r\n\r\nThe Alps and the Himalayas, much younger than our Appalachians, were\r\nalso begotten and nursed in the cradle of a vast geosyncline in the\r\nTertiary seas. We speak of the birth of a mountain-range in terms of\r\na common human occurrence, or as if it were an event that might be\r\nwitnessed, measurable in human years or days, whereas it is an event\r\nmeasurable only in geologic periods, and geologic periods are marked\r\noff only on the dial-face of eternity. The old Hebrew writer gave\r\nbut a faint image of it when he said that with the Lord a thousand\r\nyears are as one day; it is hardly one hour of the slow beat of that\r\nclock whose hours mark the periods of the earth's development.\r\n\r\nThe whole long period during which the race of man has been rushing\r\nabout, tickling and scratching and gashing the surface of the globe,\r\nwould make but a small fraction of one of the days that make up the\r\nperiods with which the geologist deals. And the span of human life,\r\nhow it dwindles to a point in the face of the records of the rocks!\r\nDoubtless the birth of some of the mountain-systems of the globe is\r\nstill going on, and we suspect it not; an elevation of one foot in a\r\ncentury would lift up the Sierra or the Rocky Mountains in a\r\ncomparatively short geologic period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the geologist that emboldened Tennyson to sing,--\r\n\r\n    \"The hills are shadows and they flow\r\n       From form to form and nothing stands,\r\n       They melt like mists, the solid lands,\r\n     Like clouds they shape themselves and go.\"\r\n\r\nBut some hills flow much faster than others. Hills made up of the\r\nlatest or newest formations seem to take to themselves wings the\r\nfastest.\r\n\r\nThe Archaean hills and mountains, how slowly they melt away! In the\r\nAdirondacks, in northern New England, in the Highlands of the\r\nHudson, they still hold their heads high and have something of the\r\nvigor of their prime.\r\n\r\nThe most enduring rocks are the oldest; and the most perishable are,\r\nas a rule, the youngest. It takes time to season and harden the\r\nrocks, as it does men. Then the earlier rocks seem to have had\r\nbetter stuff in them. They are nearer the paternal granite; and the\r\nprimordial seas that mothered them were, no doubt, richer in the\r\nvarious mineral solutions that knitted and compacted the sedimentary\r\ndeposits. The Cretaceous formations melt away almost like snow. I\r\nfancy that the ocean now, compared with the earlier condition when\r\nit must have been so saturated with mineral elements, is like\r\nthrice-skimmed milk.\r\n\r\nThe geologist is not stinted for time. He deals with big figures. It\r\nis refreshing to see him dealing out his years so liberally. Do you\r\nwant a million or two to account for this or that? You shall have it\r\nfor the asking. He has an enormous balance in the bank of Time, and\r\nhe draws upon it to suit his purpose. In human history a thousand\r\nyears is a long time. Ten thousand years wipe out human history\r\ncompletely. Ten thousand more, and we are probably among the rude\r\ncave-men or river-drift men. One hundred thousand, and we\r\nare--where? Probably among the simian ancestors of man. A million\r\nyears, and we are probably in Eocene or Miocene times, among the\r\nhuge and often grotesque mammals, and our ancestor, a little\r\ncreature, probably of the marsupial kind, is skulking about and\r\nhiding from the great carnivorous beasts that would devour him.\r\n\r\n     \"Little man, least of all,\r\n     Among the legs of his guardians tall,\r\n     Walked about with puzzled look.\r\n     Him by the hand dear Nature took,\r\n     Dearest Nature, strong and kind,\r\n     Whispered, 'Darling, never mind!\r\n     To-morrow they will wear another face,\r\n     The founder thou; these are thy race!'\"\r\n\r\nI fancy Emerson would be surprised and probably displeased at the\r\nuse I have made of his lines. I remember once hearing him say that\r\nhis teacher in such matters as I am here touching upon was Agassiz,\r\nand not Darwin. Yet did he not write that audacious line about \"the\r\nworm striving to be man\"? And Nature certainly took his \"little man\"\r\nby the hand and led him forward, and on the morrow the rest of the\r\nanimal creation \"wore another face.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my geological studies I have had a good deal of trouble with the\r\nsedimentary rocks, trying to trace their genealogy and getting them\r\nproperly fathered and mothered. I do not think the geologists fully\r\nappreciate what a difficult problem the origin of these rocks\r\npresents to the lay mind. They bulk so large, while the mass of\r\noriginal crystalline rocks from which they are supposed to have been\r\nderived is so small in comparison. In the case of our own continent\r\nwe have, to begin with, about two million of square miles of\r\nArchaean rocks in detached lines and masses, rising here and there\r\nabove the primordial ocean; a large triangular mass in Canada, and\r\ntwo broken lines of smaller masses running south from it on each\r\nside of the continent, inclosing a vast interior sea between them.\r\nTo end with, we have the finished continent of eight million or more\r\nsquare miles, of an average height of two thousand feet above the\r\nsea, built up or developed from and around these granite centres\r\nvery much as the body is built up and around the bones, and of such\r\nprodigious weight that some of our later geologists seek to account\r\nfor the continental submarine shelf that surrounds the continent on\r\nthe theory that the land has slowly crept out into the sea under the\r\npressure of its own weight. And all this,--to say nothing of the\r\nvast amount of rock, in some places a mile or two in thickness, that\r\nhas been eroded from the land surfaces of the globe in later\r\ngeological time, and now lies buried in the seas and lakes,--we are\r\ntold, is the contribution of those detached portions of Archaean\r\nrock that first rose above the primordial seas. It is a greater\r\nmiracle than that of the loaves and the fishes. We have vastly more\r\nto end with than we had to begin with. The more the rocks have been\r\ndestroyed, the more they have increased; the more the waters have\r\ndevoured them, the more they have multiplied and waxed strong.\r\n\r\nEither the geologists have greatly underestimated the amount of\r\nArchaean rock above the waters at the start, or else there are\r\nfactors in the problem that have not been taken into the account.\r\nLyell seems to have appreciated the difficulties of the problem,\r\nand, to account for the forty thousand feet of sediment deposited in\r\nPalaeozoic times in the region of the Appalachians, he presupposes a\r\nneighboring continent to the east, probably formed of Laurentian\r\nrocks, where now rolls the Atlantic. But if such a continent once\r\nexisted, would not some vestige of it still remain? The fact that no\r\ntrace of it as been found, it seems to me, invalidates Lyell's\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nArchaean time in geologic history answers to pre-historic time in\r\nhuman history; all is dark and uncertain, though we are probably\r\nsafe in assuming that there was more strife and turmoil among the\r\nearth-building forces than there has ever been since. The body of\r\nunstratified rock within the limits of North America may have been\r\nmuch greater than is supposed, but it seems to me impossible that it\r\ncould have been anything like as massive as the continent now is. If\r\nthis had been the case there would have been no great interior sea,\r\nand no wide sea-margins in which the sediments of the stratified\r\nrocks could have been deposited. More than four fifths of the\r\ncontinent is of secondary origin and shows that vast geologic eras\r\nwent to the making of it.\r\n\r\nIt is equally hard to believe that the primary or igneous rocks,\r\nwhere they did appear, were sufficiently elevated to have furnished\r\nthrough erosion the all but incalculable amount of material that\r\nwent to the making of our vast land areas. But the geologists give\r\nme the impression that this is what we are to believe.\r\n\r\nChamberlin and Salisbury, in their recent college geology, teach\r\nthat each new formation implies the destruction of an equivalent\r\namount of older rock--every system being entirely built up out of\r\nthe older one beneath it. Lyell and Dana teach the same thing. If\r\nthis were true, could there have been any continental growth at all?\r\nCould a city grow by the process of pulling down the old buildings\r\nfor material to build the new? If the geology is correct, I fail to\r\nsee how there would be any more land surface to-day then there was\r\nin Archaean times. Each new formation would only have replaced the\r\nold from which it came. The Silurian would only have made good the\r\nwaste of the Cambrian, and the Devonian made good the waste of the\r\nSilurian, and so on to the top of the series, and in the end we\r\nshould still have been at the foot of the stairs. That vast interior\r\nsea that in Archaean times stretched from the rudimentary\r\nAppalachian Mountains to the rudimentary Rocky Mountains, and which\r\nis now the heart of the continent, would still have been a part of\r\nthe primordial ocean. But instead of that, this sea is filled and\r\npiled up with sedimentary rocks thousands of feet thick, that have\r\ngiven birth on their surfaces to thousands of square miles of as\r\nfertile soil as the earth holds.\r\n\r\nThat the original crystalline rocks played the major part in the\r\ngenealogy of the subsequent stratified rocks, it would be folly to\r\ndeny. But it seems to me that chemical and cosmic processes, working\r\nthrough the air and the water, have contributed more than they have\r\nbeen credited with.\r\n\r\nIt looks as if in all cases when the soil is carried to the\r\nseabottom as sediment, and again, during the course of ages,\r\nconsolidated into rocks, the rocks thus formed have exceeded in bulk\r\nthe rocks that gave them birth. Something analogous to vital growth\r\ntakes place. It seems as if the original granite centres set the\r\nworld-building forces at work. They served as nuclei around which\r\nthe materials gathered. These rocks bred other rocks, and these\r\nstill others, and yet others, till the framework of the land was\r\nfairly established. They were like the pioneer settlers who plant\r\nhomes here and there in the wilderness, and then in due time all the\r\nland is peopled.\r\n\r\nThe granite is the Adam rock, and through a long line of descent the\r\nmajor part of all the other rocks directly or indirectly may be\r\ntraced. Thus the granite begot the Algonquin, the Algonquin begot\r\nthe Cambrian, the Cambrian begot the Silurian, the Silurian begot\r\nthe Devonian, and so on up through the Carboniferous, the Permian,\r\nthe Mesozoic rocks, the Tertiary rocks, to the latest Quaternary\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nBut the curious thing about it all is the enormous progeny from so\r\nsmall a beginning; the rocks seem really to have grown and\r\nmultiplied like organic beings; the seed of the granite seems to\r\nhave fertilized the whole world of waters, and in due time they\r\nbrought forth this huge family of stratified rocks. There stands the\r\nArchaean Adam, his head and chest in Canada, his two unequal legs\r\nrunning, one down the Pacific coast, and one down the Atlantic\r\nCoast, and from his loins, we are told, all the progeny of rocks and\r\nsoils that make up the continent have sprung, one generation\r\nsucceeding another in regular order. His latest offspring is in the\r\nSouth and Southwest, and in the interior. These are the new\r\ncountries, geologically speaking, as well as humanly speaking.\r\n\r\nThe great interior sea, epicontinental, the geologists call it,\r\nseems to have been fermenting and laboring for untold aeons in\r\nbuilding up these parts of the continent. In the older Eastern\r\nStates we find the sons and grandsons of the old Adam granite; but\r\nin the South and West we find his offspring of the twentieth or\r\ntwenty-fifth generation, and so unlike their forebears; the Permian\r\nrocks, for instance, and the Cretaceous rocks, are soft and\r\nunenduring, for the most part. The later slates, too, are\r\ndegenerates, and much of the sandstones have the hearts of\r\nprodigals. In the Bad Lands of Arizona I could have cut my way into\r\nsome of the Eocene formations with my pocket-knife. Apparently the\r\nfarther away we get from the parent granite, the more easily is the\r\nrock eroded. Nearly all the wonderful and beautiful sculpturing of\r\nthe rocks in the West and Southwest is in rocks of comparatively\r\nrecent date.\r\n\r\nCan we say that all the organic matter of our time is from\r\npreexisting organic matter? one organism torn down to build up\r\nanother? that the beginning of the series was as great as the end?\r\nThere may have been as much matter in a state of vital organization\r\nin Carboniferous or in Cretaceous times as in our own, but there is\r\ncertainly more now than in early Palaeozoic times. Yet every grain\r\nof this matter has existed somewhere in some form for all time. Or\r\nwe might ask if all the wealth of our day is from preexisting\r\nwealth--one fortune pulled down to build up another,--too often the\r\ncase, it is true,--thus passing the accumulated wealth along from\r\none generation to another. On the contrary, has there not been a\r\nsteady gain of that we call wealth through the ingenuity and the\r\nindustry of man directed towards the latent wealth of the earth? In\r\na parallel manner has there been a gain in the bulk of the secondary\r\nrocks through the action of the world-building forces directed to\r\nthe sea, the air, and the preexisting rocks. Had there been no gain,\r\nthe fact would suggest the ill luck of a man investing his capital\r\nin business and turning it over and over, and having no more money\r\nat the end than he had in the beginning.\r\n\r\nNothing is in the sedimentary rock that was not at one time in the\r\noriginal granite, or in the primordial seas, or in the primordial\r\natmosphere, or in the heavens above, or in the interior of the earth\r\nbeneath. We must sweep the heavens, strain the seas, and leach the\r\nair, to obtain all this material. Evidently the growth of these\r\nrocks has been mainly a chemical process--a chemical organization of\r\npreexisting material, as much so as the growth of a plant or a tree\r\nor an animal. The color and texture and volume of each formation\r\ndiffer so radically from those of the one immediately before it as\r\nto suggest something more than a mere mechanical derivation of one\r\nfrom the other. New factors, new sources, are implied. \"The farther\r\nwe recede from the present time,\" says Lyell, \"and the higher the\r\nantiquity of the formations which we examine, the greater are the\r\nchanges which the sedimentary deposits have undergone.\" Above all\r\nhave chemical processes produced changes. This constant passage of\r\nthe mineral elements of the rocks through the cycle of erosion,\r\nsedimentation, and reinduration has exposed them to the action of\r\nthe air, the light, the sea, and has thus undoubtedly brought about\r\na steady growth in their volume and a constant change in their color\r\nand texture. Marl and clay and green sand and salt and gypsum and\r\nshale, all have their genesis, all came down to us in some way or in\r\nsome degree, from the aboriginal crystalline rocks; but what\r\ntransformations and transmutations they have undergone! They have\r\npassed through Nature's laboratory and taken on new forms and\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n\"All sediments deposited in the sea,\" says my geology, \"undergo more\r\nor less chemical change,\" and many chemical changes involve notable\r\nchanges in volume of the mineral matter concerned. It has been\r\nestimated that the conversion of granite rock into soil increases\r\nits volume eighty-eight per cent, largely as the result of\r\nhydration, or the taking up of water in the chemical union. The\r\nprocesses of oxidation and carbonation are also expansive processes.\r\nWhether any of this gain in volume is lost in the process of\r\nsedimentation and reconsolidation, I do not know. Probably all the\r\nelements that water takes from the rocks by solution, it returns to\r\nthem when the disintegrated parts, in the form of sediment in the\r\nsea, is again converted into strata. It is in this cycle of rock\r\ndisintegration and rock re-formation that the processes of life go\r\non. Without the decay of the rock there could be no life on the\r\nland. Water and air are always the go-betweens of the organic and\r\ninorganic. After the rains have depleted the rocks of their soluble\r\nparts and carried them to the sea, they come back and aid vegetable\r\nlife to unlock and appropriate other soluble parts, and thus build\r\nup the vegetable and, indirectly, the animal world.\r\n\r\nThat the growth of the continents owes much to the denudation of the\r\nsea-bottom, brought about by the tides and the ocean-currents, which\r\nwere probably much more powerful in early than in late geologic\r\ntimes, and to submarine mineral springs and volcanic eruptions of\r\nashes and mud, admits of little doubt. That it owes much to\r\nextra-terrestrial sources--to meteorites and meteoric dust--also\r\nadmits of little doubt.\r\n\r\nIt seems reasonable that earlier in the history of the evolution of\r\nour solar system there should have been much more meteoric matter\r\ndrifting through the interplanetary spaces than during the later\r\nages, and that a large amount of this matter should have found its\r\nway to the earth, in the form either of solids or of gases. Probably\r\nmuch more material has been contributed by volcanic eruptions than\r\nthere is any evidence of apparent. The amount of mineral matter held\r\nin solution by the primordial seas must have been enormous. The\r\namount of rock laid down in Palaeozoic times is estimated at fifty\r\nthousand feet, and of this thirteen thousand feet were limestone;\r\nwhile the amount laid down in Mesozoic times, for aught we know a\r\nperiod quite as long, amounts to eight thousand feet, indicating, it\r\nseems to me, that the deposition of sediment went on much more\r\nrapidly in early geologic times. We are nearer the beginning of\r\nthings. All chemical processes in the earth's crust were probably\r\nmore rapid. Doubtless the rainfall was more, but the land areas must\r\nhave been less. The greater amount of carbon dioxide in the air\r\nduring Palaeozoic times would have favored more rapid carbonation.\r\nWhen granite is dissolved by weathering, carbon unites with the\r\npotash, the soda, the lime, the magnesia, and the iron, and turns\r\nthem into carbonates and swells their bulk. The one thing that is\r\npassed along from formation to formation unchanged is the quartz\r\nsand. Quartz is tough, and the sand we find to-day is practically\r\nthe same that was dissolved out of the first crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nTake out of the soil and out of the rocks all that they owe to the\r\nair,--the oxygen and the carbon,--and how would they dwindle! The\r\nlimestone rocks would practically disappear.\r\n\r\nProbably not less that one fourth of all the sedimentary rocks are\r\nlimestone, which is of animal origin. How much of the lime of which\r\nthese rocks were built was leached out of the land-areas, and how\r\nmuch was held in solution by the original sea-water, is of course a\r\nquestion. But all the carbon they hold came out of the air. The\r\nwaters of the primordial ocean were probably highly charged with\r\nmineral matter, with various chlorides and sulphates and carbonates,\r\nsuch as the sulphate of soda, the sulphate of lime, the sulphate of\r\nmagnesia, the chloride of sodium, and the like. The chloride of\r\nsodium, or salt, remains, while most of the other compounds have\r\nbeen precipitated through the agency of minute forms of life, and\r\nnow form parts of the soil and of the stratified rocks beneath it.\r\n\r\nIf the original granite is the father of the rocks, the sea is the\r\nmother. In her womb they were gestated and formed. Had not this\r\nseesaw of land and ocean taken place, there could have been no\r\ncontinental growth. Every time the land took a bath in the sea, it\r\ncame up enriched and augmented. Each new layer of rocky strata taken\r\non showed a marked change in color and texture. It was a kind of\r\nevolution from that which preceded it. Whether the land always went\r\ndown, or whether the sea at times came up, by reason of some\r\ndisturbance of the ocean floors in its abysmal depths, we have no\r\nmeans of knowing. In any case, most of the land has taken a sea bath\r\nmany times, not all taking the plunge at the same time, but\r\ndifferent parts going down in successive geologic ages. The original\r\ngranite upheavals in British America, and in New York and New\r\nEngland, seem never to have taken this plunge, except an area about\r\nLake Superior which geologists say has gone down four or five times.\r\nThe Laurentian and Adirondack ranges have never been in pickle in\r\nthe sea since they first saw the light. In most other parts of the\r\ncontinent, the seesaw between the sea and the land has gone on\r\nsteadily from the first, and has been the chief means of the\r\nupbuilding of the land.\r\n\r\nTo the slow and oft-repeated labor-throes of the sea we owe the\r\ncontinents. But the sea devours her children. Large areas, probably\r\ncontinental in extent, have gone down and have not yet come up, if\r\nthey ever will. The great Mississippi Valley was under water and\r\nabove water time after time during the Palaeozoic period. The last\r\ngreat invasion of the land by the sea, and probably the greatest of\r\nall, seems to have been in Cretaceous times, at the end of the\r\nMesozoic period. There were many minor invasions during Tertiary\r\ntimes, but none on so large a scale as this Cretaceous invasion. At\r\nthis time a large part of North and South America, and of Europe,\r\nand parts of Asia and Australia went under the ocean. It was as if\r\nthe earth had exhaled her breath and let her abdomen fall. The sea\r\nunited the Gulf of Mexico with the Arctic Ocean, and covered the\r\nPrairie and the Gulf States and came up over New Jersey to the foot\r\nof the Archaean Highlands. This great marine inundation probably\r\ntook place several million years ago. It was this visitation of the\r\nsea that added the vast chalk beds to England and France. In parts\r\nof this country limestone beds five or six thousand feet thick were\r\nlaid down, as well as extensive chalk beds. The earth seems to have\r\ntaken another hitch in her girdle during this era. As the land went\r\ndown, the mountains came up. Most of the great Western\r\nmountain-chains were formed during this movement, and the mountains\r\nof Mexico were pushed up. The Alps were still under the sea, but the\r\nSierra and the Alleghanies were again lifted.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to me to know that in Colorado charred wood,\r\nand even charcoal, have been found in Cretaceous deposits. The fact\r\nseems to give a human touch to that long-gone time. It was, of\r\ncourse, long ages before the evolution of man, as man, had taken\r\nplace, yet such is the power of association, that those charred\r\nsticks instantly call him to mind, as if we had come upon the place\r\nof his last campfire. At any rate, it is something to know that man,\r\nwhen he did come, did not have to discover or invent fire, but that\r\nthis element, which has played such a large part in his development\r\nand civilization, was here before him, waiting, like so many other\r\nthings in nature, to be his servant and friend. As Vulcan was\r\neverywhere rampant during this age, throwing out enough lava in\r\nIndia alone to put a lava blanket four or five feet thick over the\r\nwhole surface of the globe, it was probably this fire that charred\r\nthe wood. It would be interesting to know if these enormous\r\nlava-flows always followed the subsidence of some part of the\r\nearth's crust. In Cretaceous times both the subsidence and the lava-\r\nflows seem to have been worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe seem to think that the earth has sown all her wild oats, that her\r\nriotous youth is far behind her, and that she is now passing into a\r\nserene old age. Had we lived during any of the great periods of the\r\npast, we might have had the same impression, so tranquil, for the\r\nmost part, has been the earth's history, so slow and rhythmical have\r\nbeen the beats of the great clock of time. We see this in the\r\nhomogeneity of the stratified rocks, layer upon layer for thousands\r\nof feet as uniform in texture and quality as the goods a modern\r\nfactory turns out, every yard of it like every other yard. No hitch\r\nor break anywhere. The bedding-planes of many kinds of rock occur at\r\nas regular intervals as if they had been determined by some kind of\r\nmachinery. Here, on the formation where I live, there are alternate\r\nlayers of slate and sandstone, three or four inches thick, for\r\nthousands of feet in extent; they succeed each other as regularly as\r\nthe bricks and mortar in a brick wall, and are quite as homogeneous.\r\nWhat does this mean but that for an incalculable period the\r\nprocesses of erosion and deposition went on as tranquilly as a\r\nsummer day? There was no strike among the workmen, and no change in\r\nthe plan of the building, or in the material.\r\n\r\nThe Silurian limestone, the old red sandstone, the Hamilton flag,\r\nthe Oneida conglomerate, where I have known them, are as homogeneous\r\nas a snowbank, or as the ice on a mountain lake; grain upon grain,\r\nall from the same source in each case, and sifted and sorted by the\r\nsame agents, and the finished product as uniform in color and\r\nquality as the output of some great mill.\r\n\r\nThen, after a vast interval, there comes a break: something like an\r\nend and a new beginning, as if one day of creation were finished and\r\na new one begun. The different formations lie unconformably upon\r\neach other, which means revolution of some sort. There has been a\r\nstrike or a riot in the great mill, or it has lain idle for a long\r\nperiod, and when it has resumed, a different product is the result.\r\nSomething happened between each two layers. What?\r\n\r\nThough in remote geological ages the earth-building and\r\nearth-shaping forces were undoubtedly more active than they are now,\r\nand periods of deformation and upheaval were more frequent, yet had\r\nwe lived in any of those periods we should probably have found the\r\ncourse of nature, certainly when measured by human generations, as\r\neven and tranquil as we find it to-day. The great movements are so\r\nslow and gentle, for the most part, that we should not have been\r\naware of them had we been on the spot. Once in a million or a\r\nhalf-million years there may have been terrific earthquakes and\r\nvolcanic eruptions, such as seem to have taken place in Tertiary\r\ntime, and at the end of the Palaeozoic period. Yet the vast\r\nstretches of time between were evidently times of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the great glacial winter of Pleistocene times\r\ncame on as gradually as our own winter, or through a long period of\r\nslowly falling temperature, and as it seems to have been many\r\nhundred thousand times as long, this preceding period, or great\r\nfall, was probably equally long--so long that the whole of recorded\r\nhuman history would form but a small fraction of it. It may easily\r\nbe, I think, that we are now living in the spring of the great cycle\r\nof geologic seasons. The great ice-sheet has withdrawn into the Far\r\nNorth like snowbanks that linger in our wood in late spring, where\r\nit still covers Greenland as it once covered this country. When the\r\nseason of summer is reached, some hundreds of thousands of years\r\nhence, it may be that tropical life, both animal and vegetable, will\r\nagain flourish on the shores of the Arctic Ocean, as it did in\r\nTertiary times. And all this change will come about so quietly and\r\nso slowly that nobody will suspect it.\r\n\r\nThat the crust of the earth is becoming more and more stable seems a\r\nnatural conclusion, but that all folding and shearing and disruption\r\nof the strata are at an end, is a conclusion we cannot reach in the\r\nface of the theory that the earth is shrinking as it cools.\r\n\r\nThe earth cools and contracts with almost infinite slowness, and the\r\ngreat crustal changes that take place go on, for the most part, so\r\nquietly and gently that we should not suspect them were we present\r\non the spot, and long generations would not suspect them. Elevations\r\nhave taken place across the beds of rivers without deflecting the\r\ncourse of the river; the process was so slow that the river sawed\r\ndown through the rock as fast as it came up. Nearly all the great\r\ncosmic and terrestrial changes and revolutions are veiled from us by\r\nthis immeasurable lapse of time.\r\n\r\nAny prediction about the permanence of the land as we know it, or as\r\nthe race has known it, or of our immunity from earthquakes or\r\nvolcanic eruptions, or of a change of climate, or of any cosmic\r\ncatastrophe, based on human experience, is vain and worthless. What\r\nis or has been in man's time is no criterion as to what will be in\r\nGod's time. The periods of great upheaval and deformation in the\r\nearth's crust appear to be separated by millions of years. Away back\r\nin pre-Cambrian times, there appear to have been immense periods\r\nduring which the peace and repose of the globe were as profound as\r\nin our own time. Then at the end of Palaeozoic time--how many\r\nmillions of years is only conjectural--the truce of aeons was\r\nbroken, and the dogs of war let loose; it was a period of revolution\r\nwhich resulted in the making of one of our greatest\r\nmountain-systems, the Appalachian, and in an unprecedented\r\nextinction of species. Later eras have witnessed similar\r\nrevolutions. Why may they not come again? The shrinking of the\r\ncooling globe must still go on, and this shrinking must give rise to\r\nsurface disturbances and dislocations, maybe in the uplift of new\r\nmountain-ranges from the sea-bottom, now undreamed of, and in\r\nvolcanic eruptions as great as any in the past. Such a shrinkage and\r\neruption made the Hawaiian Islands, probably in Tertiary times; such\r\na shrinkage may make other islands and other continents before\r\nanother period of equal time has elapsed.\r\n\r\nOf course the periods and eras into which the geologists divide\r\ngeologic time are as arbitrary as the months and seasons into which\r\nwe divide our year, and they fade out into each other in much the\r\nsame way; but they are really as marked as our seasonal divisions.\r\nNot in their climates--for the climate of the globe seems to have\r\nbeen uniformly warm from pole to pole, without climatic zones,\r\nthroughout the vast stretch of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic times--but in\r\nthe succession of animal and vegetable life which they show. The\r\nrocks are the cemeteries of the different forms of life that have\r\nappeared upon the globe, and here the geologist reads their\r\nsuccession in time, and assigns them to his geologic horizons\r\naccordingly. The same or allied forms appeared upon all parts of the\r\nearth at approximately the same time, so that he can trace his\r\ndifferent formations around the world by the fossils they hold. Each\r\nperiod had its dominant forms. The Silurian was the great age of\r\ntrilobites; the Devonian, the age of fishes; Mesozoic times swarm\r\nwith the gigantic reptiles; and in Tertiary times the mammals are\r\ndominant. Each period and era has its root in that which preceded\r\nit. There were rude, half-defined fishes in the Silurian, and\r\nprobably the beginning of amphibians in the Devonian, and some small\r\nmammalian forms in the Mesozoic time, and doubtless rude studies of\r\nthe genus Homo in Tertiary times. Nature works up her higher forms\r\nJike a human inventor from rude beginnings. Her first models barely\r\nsuggest her later achievements.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable world it has been the same; from the first simple\r\nalgae in the Cambrian seas up to the forests of our own times, the\r\ngradation is easily traced. Step by step has vegetable life mounted.\r\nThe great majority of the plants and animals of one period fail to\r\npass over into the next, just as our spring flowers fail to pass\r\nover into summer, and our summer flowers into fall. But the law of\r\nevolution is at work, and life always rises on stepping-stones of\r\nits dead self to higher things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHOLIDAYS IN HAWAII\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the edge of the world my islands lie,\" sings Mrs. Frear in her\r\nlittle lyric on the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\n    \"On the edge of the world my islands lie,\r\n     Under the sun-steeped sky;\r\n       And their waving palms\r\n       Are bounteous alms\r\n     To the soul-spent passer-by.\r\n\r\n    \"On the edge of the world my islands sleep\r\n     In a slumber soft and deep.\r\n       What should they know\r\n       Of a world of woe,\r\n     And myriad men that weep?\"\r\n\r\nOn the rim of the world my fancy seemed to see them that May day\r\nwhen we went aboard the huge Pacific steamship in San Francisco\r\nHarbor, and she pointed her prow westward toward the vast wilderness\r\nof the Pacific--on the edge of the world, looking out and down\r\nacross the vast water toward Asia and Australia. I wondered if the\r\ngreat iron ship could find them, and if we should realize or\r\nvisualize the geography or the astronomy when we got there, and see\r\nourselves on the huge rotundity of the globe not far above her\r\nequatorial girdle.\r\n\r\nYes, on the rim of the world they lie to the traveler steaming\r\ntoward them, and on the rim of the world they lie in his memory\r\nafter his return, basking there in that tropical sunlight, forever\r\nfanned by those cooling trade winds, and encompassed by that\r\nmorning-glory sea. With my mind's eye I behold them rising from that\r\nenormous abyss of the Pacific, fire-born and rain-carved, vast\r\nvolcanic mountains miles deep under the sea, and in some cases miles\r\nhigh above it, clothed with verdure and teeming with life, the scene\r\nof long-gone cosmic strife and destruction, now the abode of rural\r\nand civic peace and plenty.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific treated me so much better than the Atlantic ever had\r\nthat I am probably inclined to overestimate everything I saw on the\r\nvoyage. It was the first trip at sea that ever gave me any pleasure.\r\nThe huge vessels are in themselves a great comfort, and in the\r\nplacid waters and the sliding down the rotund side of the great\r\nglobe under warmer and warmer skies one gains a very agreeable\r\nexperience. The first day's run must have carried us out and over\r\nthat huge Pacific abyss, the Tuscarora Deep, where there were nearly\r\nfour miles of water under us. Some of our aeroplanes have gone up\r\nhalf that distance and disappeared from sight. I fancy that our\r\nship, more than six hundred feet long, would have appeared a very\r\nsmall object, floating across this briny firmament, could one have\r\nlooked up at it from the bottom of that sea.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaiian Islands rise from the border of that vast deep, and one\r\ncan fancy how that huge pot must have boiled back in Tertiary times,\r\nwhen the red-hot lava of which they are mainly built up was poured\r\nfrom the interior of the globe.\r\n\r\nSofter and more balmy grew the air every day, more and more placid\r\nand richly tinted grew the sea, till, on the morning of the sixth\r\nday, we saw ahead of us, low on the horizon, the dim outlines of the\r\nmountains of Molokai. The island of Oahu, upon which Honolulu is\r\nsituated, was soon in sight. It was not long before we saw Diamond\r\nHead, a vast crater bowl, eight hundred feet high on its ocean side,\r\nand half a mile across, sitting there upon the shore like some huge,\r\nstrange work of man's hand, running back through the hills with a\r\nlevel rim, and seaward with a sloping base, brown and ribbed, and in\r\nevery way unique and striking.\r\n\r\nWe were approaching a land the child of tropic seas and volcanic\r\nlava, and many of the features were new and strange to us. The\r\nmountains looked familiar in outline, but the colors of the\r\nlandscape, the soft lilacs, greens, and browns, and the whole\r\natmosphere of the scene, were unlike anything we had ever before\r\nseen. And Diamond Head, what a feature it was! Had it only had a\r\nhead, one could easily have seen in it a suggestion of a couchant\r\nlion, bony, huge, and tawny, looking seaward, and guarding the\r\nharbor of Honolulu which lies just behind it. Into this harbor, in\r\nthe soft morning air, our ship soon found its way, and the monotony\r\nof the vast, unpeopled sea was quickly succeeded by human scenes of\r\nthe most varied and animated character, not the least novel of which\r\nwere the swarms of half-amphibious native boys who surrounded the\r\nvessel as she lay at the wharf, and with brown, upturned faces and\r\nbeckoning hands tempted the passengers to toss dimes into the water.\r\nAs the coins struck the surface they would dive with the ease and\r\nquickness of seals, and seize the silver apparently before it had\r\ngone a yard toward the bottom. Holding the coins up to view between\r\nthe thumb and finger, they would slip them into their mouths and\r\nsolicit more.\r\n\r\nOn shore we were greeted with the music of the Royal Hawaiian Band,\r\nand a motley crowd of Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, and\r\nAmericans, bearing colored leis, or wreaths of flowers, which they\r\nwaved at friends on board, and with which they bedecked them as soon\r\nas they came off the gangplank. It was a Babel of tongues in which\r\nthe strange, vowel-choked language of the Hawaiians was conspicuous.\r\n\r\nHonolulu is a beautiful city, clean, bright, well ordered, and well\r\nappointed,--electric lights, good streets, electric cars, fine\r\nhotels and clubs, excellent fire protection, mountain water,\r\nlibraries, parks, handsome buildings, attractive homes,--in fact,\r\nall that we boast of in our home cities. Embosomed in palms, with\r\nmangoes, and other tropical trees, with a profusion of gorgeously\r\ncolored vines and hedges, with spacious, well-kept grounds about the\r\nlarge and comfortable houses in the residential portion--these\r\nfeatures, with the ready hospitality of the people, made our hearts\r\nwarm towards it at once.\r\n\r\nVolcanic heights on all the land side look down upon the city. Mount\r\nTantalus, rising four thousand feet above the sea, is just back of\r\nit, with its long slopes of volcanic ash and sand now clothed by\r\nforests and fertile fields, and a huge ancient crater called the\r\nPunch Bowl, born probably on the selfsame day, the geologists think,\r\nas Diamond Head, dominates the city in the immediate foreground. If\r\nthe Punch Bowl were again to overflow with the fiery liquid, the\r\ncity would soon go up in smoke. But its bowl-like interior is now\r\ncovered with grass and trees, and presents a scene of the most\r\npeaceful, rural character.\r\n\r\nThe Orient and the Occident meet in Honolulu. There Asia and America\r\njoin hands. The main features of the city are decidedly American,\r\nbut the people seen upon the street and at work indoors and out are\r\nmore than half Oriental. The native population cuts only a small\r\nfigure. The real workers--carpenters, masons, field hands, and\r\nhouse servants--are mostly Japanese. Virtually all the work of the\r\nimmense sugar plantations is done by the little brown men and women,\r\nwhile China supplies some of the merchants in the city and the\r\nsailors and stewards on the ocean steamers. What admirable servants\r\nthe Chinese make, so respectful, so prompt, so silent, so quick to\r\ncomprehend! The Japanese house servants on the islands also give\r\nefficient and gracious service.\r\n\r\nI had gone to Honolulu reluctantly, but tarried there joyfully. The\r\nfine climate, with its even temperature of about eighty degrees\r\nFahrenheit, and with all that is enervating or oppressive in that\r\ndegree of heat winnowed out of it by the ceaseless trade winds; the\r\nalmost unbroken sunshine, perfumed now and then by a sprinkle of\r\nsunlit rain from the mountains; the wonderful sea laving the shores\r\non the one hand and the cool, cloud-capped, and rain-drenched\r\nheights within easy reach on the other; the green, cozy valleys; the\r\nbroad sweep of plain; the new, strange nature on every side; the\r\nnovel and delicious fruits; the pepsin-charged papaya, or tree\r\nmelon, which tickles the palate while it heals and renews the whole\r\ndigestive system; the mangoes (oh, the mangoes!); the cordiality of\r\nthe people; the inviting bungalows; the clean streets; the good\r\nservice everywhere--all made me feel how mistaken was my reluctance.\r\n\r\nMost of the Americans one meets there are descendants of the\r\nmissionaries who went out from New England and New York early in the\r\nlast century, and one feels at home with them at once. Many of the\r\nresidents there have been educated in the States. The Governor, Mr.\r\nFrear, is a graduate of Yale; his wife is a graduate of Wellesley.\r\nOne day a charming Southern woman, president of the College Club,\r\ninvited us to meet the college women of the city. The gathering took\r\nplace under the trees upon the lawn of one of the older homesteads.\r\nThere were forty college women present, many of them teachers, from\r\nVassar, Wellesley, Smith, Bryn Mawr, and Barnard. Among them were\r\ntwo girls who had visited me at my cabin, \"Slabsides,\" while they\r\nwere at Vassar.\r\n\r\nWide as is the world, the traveler is pretty sure to strike threads\r\nof relation with his home country wherever he goes. I made the\r\nacquaintance in Honolulu of a man from my own county; another, who\r\nshowed us great kindness, was from an adjoining county; while one\r\nday upon the street I was called by name by a man whom I had known\r\nas a boy in the town where I now live.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday a walking-club, largely made up of men and women\r\nteachers, whose native Hawaiian name meant \"Walkers in Unfrequented\r\nPlaces,\" asked us to join them in a walk up Palola Valley to the\r\nsite of an extinct crater well up in the mountains. These walkers in\r\nunfrequented places proved to be real walkers, and gave us all and\r\nmore than we had bargained for--more mud and wet and slippery trails\r\nthrough clinging vines and rank lantana scrub than was good for our\r\nshoes and garments or for the bodies inside them. It was a long pull\r\nof many miles, at first up the valley over a fair highway, then into\r\nthe woods on the mountain-side along a trail that was muddy and\r\nslippery from the recent showers, and most of the time was buried\r\nout of sight beneath the high, coarse stag-horn fern and a thick\r\ngrowth of lantana that met above it as high as our shoulders. A more\r\ndiscouraging mountain climb I never undertook. The vegetation was\r\nall novel, but it had that barbaric rankness of all tropical woods,\r\nwith nothing of the sylvan sweetness and simplicity of our home\r\nwoods. There were no fine, towering trees, but low, gnarled, and\r\ntortuous ones, which, with their hanging vines, like the broken\r\nropes of a ship's rigging, and their parasitic growths, presented a\r\nriotous, disheveled appearance.\r\n\r\nNature in the tropics, left to herself, is harsh, aggressive,\r\nsavage; looks as though she wanted to hang you with her dangling\r\nropes, or impale you on her thorns, or engulf you in her ranks of\r\ngigantic ferns. Her mood is never as placid and sane as in the\r\nNorth. There is a tree in the Hawaiian woods that suggests a tree\r\ngone mad. It is called the hau-tree. It lies down, squirms, and\r\nwriggles all over the ground like a wounded snake; it gets up, and\r\nthen takes to earth again. Now it wants to be a vine, now it wants\r\nto be a tree. It throws somersaults, it makes itself into loops and\r\nrings, it rolls, it reaches, it doubles upon itself. Altogether it\r\nis the craziest vegetable growth I ever saw. Where you can get it up\r\noff the ground and let it perform its antics on a broad skeleton\r\nframework, it makes a cover that no sunbeam can penetrate, and forms\r\na living roof to the most charming verandas--or lanais, as they are\r\ncalled in the islands--that one can wish to see.\r\n\r\nBut I saw and heard one thing on this walk that struck a different\r\nnote: it was one of the native birds, the Oahu thrush. The moment I\r\nheard it I was reminded of our brown thrasher, though the song, or\r\nwhistle, was much finer and richer in tone than that of our bird.\r\nThe glimpse I got of the bird showed it to be of about the size and\r\nshape of our thrasher, but much brighter in color. It seems as\r\nthough the two species must have had a common origin some time,\r\nsomewhere. I was attracted by no other native bird on this walk. In\r\nthe valley below we had seen and heard the Chinese workmen going\r\nabout their rice-fields making strange sounds to drive away the\r\nrice-birds, a small, brown species that has been introduced from\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the mountain-top, we found it enveloped in fog and\r\nmist, and the scene was cold and cheerless. We looked down through a\r\nscreen of foliage into a deep valley that seemed almost beneath us,\r\nand which is supposed to have been an ancient crater. There, on the\r\nbrink, the walkers had a rude cabin, where we ate our lunch beside a\r\nfire and tried to dry our bedraggled garments.\r\n\r\nFrom this point some of the party continued their walk, looking for\r\nmore unfrequented places, but some of us had longings the other way,\r\nand retraced our steps toward the sunlight and the drier winds we\r\nhad left. We reached town footsore and bedraggled, and the little\r\nJapanese who cleaned and pressed my suit of clothes, and made them\r\nlook as good as new for seventy-five cents, well earned his money.\r\n\r\nThe walk of eight or ten miles which we took two weeks later with\r\nGovernor Frear and his wife, up the new Castle trail to the\r\nmountain-top behind Tantalus, had some features in common with the\r\nfirst walk,--the increasing mist and coolness as we entered the\r\nmountains, the dripping bushes, and the slippery paths,--but we got\r\nfiner views, and found a better-kept trail. Our walk ended on the\r\ntop of a narrow ridge of the mountain, where we ate our lunch in a\r\ncold, driving mist and were a bit uncomfortable. I was interested in\r\nthe character of the ridge upon which we sat. It was not more than\r\nsix feet wide, a screen of volcanic rock worn almost to an edge, and\r\nseparated two valleys six or seven hundred feet deep. The Governor\r\nsaid he could take me where the dividing ridge between the two\r\nvalleys was so narrow that one could literally sit astride of it, so\r\nthat one leg would point to one valley and the other to the other.\r\nThis is a feature of a new country geologically; the rains and other\r\nagents of erosion have whittled the mountains to sharp edges, but\r\nhave not yet rounded or leveled them.\r\n\r\nThe northeast trade winds which blow upon these islands nine months\r\nin the year bring a burden of moisture from the Pacific which is\r\ncondensed into rain and mist by the mountains, and which, with the\r\nrank vegetation that it fosters, carves them and sharpens them like\r\na great grindstone revolving against their sides. At a place called\r\nthe Pali--and at the Needles, on the island of Maui--it has worn\r\nthrough the mountain-chain and made deep and very picturesque gorges\r\nwhere, in the case of the Pali, the wind is so strong and steady\r\nthat you can almost lie down upon it.\r\n\r\nIt was near the Pali that I saw what I had never seen or heard of\r\nbefore--a waterfall reversed, going up instead of down. It suggested\r\nStockton's story of negative gravity. A small brook comes down off\r\nthe mountain and attempts to make the leap down a high precipice;\r\nbut the winds catch it and carry it straight up in the air like\r\nsmoke. It is translated; it becomes a mere wraith hovering above the\r\nbeetling crag. Night and day this goes on, the wind snatching from\r\nthe mountains in this summary way the water it has brought them.\r\n\r\nOn the walk with the Governor we made the acquaintance of some of\r\nthe land shells for which these islands are famous--pretty,\r\npearl-like little whorls living on the largest trees, and about the\r\nsize of a chipping sparrow's egg, with pointed ends, variously\r\ncolored. There are more than two hundred species on the different\r\nislands, I think, each valley having varieties peculiar to itself,\r\nshowing what a factor isolation is in the evolution of new species.\r\nThe Governor and his wife, and a young man who had specialized in\r\nconchology, plucked them from nearly every bush and tree; but my\r\neye, being untrained in this kind of work, was very slow in finding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nComing down from these Hawaiian mountains is like coming out of a\r\ndripping tent of clouds into the clear, warm sunshine. The change is\r\nmost delightful. Your clothing dries very quickly, and chilliness\r\ngives place to genial warmth. And the prospects that open before\r\nyou, the glimpses down into these deep, yellow-green, crater-like\r\nvalleys, checkered with neat little Chinese farms, the panorama of\r\nthe city and the sea unrolling as you come down, and always Diamond\r\nHead standing guard there to the east--how the vision of it all\r\nlingers in the memory!\r\n\r\nIn climbing the heights, it was always a surprise to me to see the\r\nPacific rise up as I rose, till it stood up like a great blue wall\r\nthere against the horizon. A level plain unrolls in the same way as\r\nwe mount above it, but it does not produce the same illusion of\r\nrising up like a wall or a mountain-range; the blue, facile water\r\ncheats the eye.\r\n\r\nOne of the novel pleasures in which most travelers indulge while in\r\nHonolulu is surf-riding at Waikiki, near Diamond Head. The sea, with\r\na floor of lava and coral, is here shallow for a long distance out,\r\nand the surf comes in at intervals like a line of steeds cantering\r\nover a plain. We went out in our bathing-suits in a long, heavy\r\ndugout, with a lusty native oarsman in each end. When several\r\nhundred yards from shore, we saw, on looking seaward, the long,\r\nshining billows coming, whereupon our oarsmen headed the canoe\r\ntoward shore, and plied their paddles with utmost vigor, uttering\r\nsimultaneously a curious, excited cry. In a moment the breaker\r\ncaught us and, in some way holding us on its crest, shot us toward\r\nthe shore like an arrow. The sensation is novel and thrilling. The\r\nfoam flies; the waters leap about you. You are coasting on the sea,\r\nand you shout with delight and pray for the sensation to continue.\r\nBut it is quickly over. The hurrying breaker slips from under you,\r\nand leaves you in the trough, while it goes foaming on the shore.\r\nThen you turn about and row out from the shore again, and wait for\r\nanother chance to be shot toward the land on the foaming crest of a\r\ngreat Pacific wave.\r\n\r\nI suppose the trick is in the skill of the oarsmen in holding the\r\nboat on the pitch of the billow so that in its rush it takes you\r\nwith it. The native boys do the feat standing on a plank. I was\r\ntempted to try this myself, but of course made a comical failure.\r\n\r\nOne of my pleasant surprises in Honolulu--one that gave the touch of\r\nnature which made me feel less a stranger there--was learning that\r\nthe European skylark had been introduced and was thriving on the\r\ngrassy slopes back of the city. The mina, a species of starling from\r\nIndia as large as our robin and rather showily dressed, with a loud,\r\nstrident voice, I had seen and heard everywhere both in town and\r\ncountry, but he was a stranger and did not appeal to me. But the\r\nthought of the skylark brought Shelley and Wordsworth, and English\r\ndowns and meadows, near to me at once, and I was eager to hear it.\r\nSo early one morning we left the Pleasanton, our tarrying-place, and\r\nclimbed the long, pastoral slope above the city, where cattle and\r\nhorses were grazing, and listened for this minstrel from the\r\nmotherland. We had not long to wait. Sure enough, not far from us\r\nthere sprang from the turf Shelley's bird, and went climbing his\r\ninvisible spiral toward the sky, pouring out those hurried, ecstatic\r\nnotes, just as I had heard him above the South Downs of England. It\r\nwas a moment of keen delight to me. The bird soared and hovered,\r\ndrifting about, as it were, before the impetuous current of his\r\nsong, with all the joy and abandon with which the poets have\r\ncredited him. It was like a bit of English literature vocal in the\r\nair there above these alien scenes. Presently another went up, and\r\nthen another, and still another, the singers behaving in every\r\nrespect as they do by the Avon and the Tweed, and for a moment I\r\nseemed to be breathing the air that Wordsworth and Shelley breathed.\r\n\r\nIf our excursion had taken us only to the island of Oahu and its\r\nbeautiful city, it would have been eminently worth while, but the\r\nlast week in May we took what is called the inter-island trip, a six\r\ndays' voyage among the various islands, when we visited the great\r\nextinct crater of Haleakala on Maui, and the active volcano Kilauea\r\non Hawaii. It is a voyage over several rough channels in a small\r\nsteamer, and my friends said, \"If you have not yet paid tribute to\r\nNeptune, you will pay it now.\" But I did not. My companions were\r\nprostrated, but I see Neptune respects age, and my slumbers were\r\nundisturbed. A wireless message had gone to Mr. Aiken, on the island\r\nof Maui, to meet us with his automobile in the morning at the\r\nlanding at Kahului. We were taken to the shore on a lighter, along\r\nwith the horses and cargo, and there found our new friend awaiting\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe great mountain of Haleakala rose up in a long line against the\r\nsky on the left, and the deeply eroded and canyoned mountains of the\r\nolder, or west, end of the island on our right. Toward the latter\r\nour guide took us. It was a pleasant spin along the good roads, in\r\nthe fresh morning air, near the beach, to Wailuku, the shire town of\r\nthe island, two or three miles distant. Here we were most hospitably\r\nentertained in the home of Mr. Penhallow, the director of a large\r\nsugar plantation.\r\n\r\nHere for the first time in my life I saw a gang of steam plows\r\nworking, pulled by a stationary engine at each end of the field, and\r\nturning over the red, heavy volcanic soil. The work was mainly in\r\nthe hands of Japanese, and was well done. We afterward saw Japanese\r\nby the score, both men and women, planting a large area of newly\r\nplowed land with sugar-cane.\r\n\r\nAfter we were rested and refreshed, and had sampled the mangoes that\r\nhad fallen from a tree near the house, Mr. Aiken took us in his\r\nautomobile up into the famous Iao Valley, at the mouth of which\r\nWailuku is situated. It is a deep, striking chasm carved out of the\r\nmountain by the stream, rank with verdure of various kinds, and\r\nlooked down upon by sharp peaks and ridges five or six thousand feet\r\nhigh. We soon reached the clear rapid, brawling stream, as bright as\r\na Catskill mountain trout brook, and after a mile or two along its\r\ncourse we came to the end of the road, where we left the machine and\r\ntook a trail that wound onward and upward over a slippery surface\r\nand through dripping bushes, for we here began to reach the skirts\r\nof the little showers that almost constantly career over and about\r\nthe interior of these mountains. I neither saw nor heard a bird or\r\nother live thing. Guava apples lay on the ground all along the\r\ntrail, and one could eat them and not make faces. Some of the sharp,\r\nknife-blade ridges that cut down toward us from the higher peaks\r\nwere very startling, and so steep and high that they could be\r\nsuccessfully scaled only by the aid of ropes and ladders. A more\r\nstriking object-lesson in erosion by rain would be hard to find.\r\nThere were no naked rocks; short, thick vegetation covered even the\r\nsteepest slopes, and the vegetable acids which this generated, and\r\nthe perpetual rains, weathered the mountains down. It soon became so\r\nwet that we stopped far short of the head of the valley, and turned\r\nback. I wished to look into the great, deep, green amphitheatre\r\nwhich seems to lie at the head, but had glimpses of it only from a\r\ndistance. How many millenniums will it be, I said to myself, before\r\nerosion will have completed its work here, and these thin, high\r\nmountain-walls will be in ruins? Surely not many.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the hospitable home we had left, and passed the\r\nmidday there. In the afternoon Mr. Aiken, guiding our eyes by the\r\nforms of trees that cut the horizon-line on the huge flank of\r\nHaleakala, pointed out the place of his own homestead, twenty or\r\nmore miles away. From this point the great mountain appeared like a\r\nvast landscape tilted up at an easy angle against the horizon. One\r\ncould hardly believe it was ten thousand feet high. The machine\r\nclimbed easily more than half the distance to Mr. Aiken's\r\nplantation, which we reached in good time in the afternoon, and\r\nwhere we passed a very enjoyable night. It was a surprise to find\r\nswarms of mosquitoes at this altitude, so free from all\r\nmosquito-breeding waters. But the house was well protected against\r\nthem. Mosquitoes, as well as flies and vermin, are not native to the\r\nisland. They came in ships not very long ago, and are now very\r\ntroublesome in certain parts. They came round the Horn. Mr. Aiken's\r\nhouse itself came round the Horn seventy or eighty years ago. It is\r\na quaint, New England type of house, and has a very homelike look.\r\nIn front of it, near the gate, stands a Japanese pine which is an\r\nobject of veneration to all Japanese who chance to come that way.\r\nOften their eyes fill with tears on beholding it, so responsive are\r\nthe little yellow men to associations of home.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Mr. Aiken drove us in a wagon to a place he has\r\ncalled \"Idlewild,\" six miles farther up the great slope of the\r\nmountain. This slope of Haleakala is like a whole township,\r\ndiversified with farms and woods, valleys and hills, resting on its\r\nelbows, so to speak, and looking out over the Pacific. We could look\r\nup to the cloud-line, about seven thousand feet above the sea, and\r\noccasionally get a glimpse of the long line of the summit through\r\nrifts in the clouds. At Idlewild our expedition, consisting of six\r\nmules and four people, was fitted out, and in the early afternoon we\r\nstarted on the trail up the mountain.\r\n\r\nFor several miles our way led over grassy slopes where cattle were\r\ngrazing, and above which skylarks were singing. This was one of the\r\nhappy surprises of the trip--the soaring and singing skylarks. All\r\nthe way till we reached the cloud-belt, we had the larks pouring\r\ndown their music from the sky above us. They seemed specially\r\njubilant. It was May in England, too, and they sang as though the\r\nspirit of those downs and fells was stirring in their hearts, under\r\nalien skies, but true to the memories of home.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached the summit we came upon another introduction from\r\noverseas--the English pheasant. One started up from some bushes only\r\na few yards from the trail, went booming away, and disappeared in a\r\ndeep gully. A little later another sprang up, uttering a cackling\r\ncry as it flew away. We saw three altogether. The only home thing we\r\nsaw was white clover in patches here and there, and it gave a most\r\nwelcome touch to the unfamiliar scenes.\r\n\r\nThe cattle we passed on the way were suffering dreadfully from\r\nanother introduction from the States--the Texas horn-fly, which had\r\nrecently made its appearance. The poor beasts were driven half-crazy\r\nby it, as their sunken eyes and poor condition plainly showed.\r\n\r\nThe trail became rougher and steeper as we ascended, and the grass\r\nand trees gave place to low, scrubby bushes. We were half an hour or\r\nmore in the cloud-belt, where the singing skylarks did not follow\r\nus. The clouds proved to be as loose of texture and as innocent as\r\nany summer fog that loiters in our valleys; but it was good to\r\nemerge into the sunshine again, and see the jagged line of the top\r\nsensibly nearer, and the canopy of clouds unroll itself beneath us.\r\nFar ahead of us and near the summit we saw a band of wild\r\ngoats--twenty-two, I counted--leisurely grazing along, and now and\r\nthen casting glances down upon us. They were domestic animals gone\r\nwild, and still retained their bizarre colors of white and black.\r\nOne big black leader with a long beard looked down at us and shook\r\nhis head threateningly. We reached the summit before the sun reached\r\nthe horizon, and our eyes looked forth upon a strange world, indeed.\r\nOn one hand the vast sea of cloud, into which the sun was about to\r\ndrop, rolled away from the mountain below us, with its white surface\r\nand the irregular masses rising up from it, suggesting a sea of\r\nfloating ice. Through rifts in it we caught occasional glimpses of\r\nthe Pacific--blue, vague, mystical gulfs that seemed filled with\r\nsomething less substantial than water. On the other hand was the\r\nvast crater of Haleakala, two thousand feet deep, and many miles\r\nacross, in which the shadows were deepening, and which looked like\r\nsome burned-out Hades.\r\n\r\nWe stood or sat on the jagged edge and saw the day depart and the\r\nnight come down, the glory of cloud and sea and sunset on the one\r\nhand, and on the other side the fearful chasm of the extinct\r\nvolcano, red and black and barren, with the hosts of darkness\r\ngathering in it. It was like a seat between heaven and hell. Then\r\nlater, when the Southern Cross came out and rose above the awful\r\ngulf, the scene was most impressive.\r\n\r\nThe crater of Haleakala is said to be the largest extinct crater in\r\nthe world. To follow all its outlines would lead one a distance of\r\nmore than twenty miles, but it is so irregular in shape that one\r\ngets only a poor conception of its extent in a view from its brink.\r\nAt its widest part it cannot be more than four or five miles across.\r\nIt was evidently formed by the whole top of the mountain having been\r\nblown out or else sunk down in recent geologic times. The fragments\r\nof jagged rock that thickly strew the surface all about the summit\r\nlook as if they might have fallen there. The floor of the interior\r\nof the crater is thickly studded with many minor craters, through\r\nwhich the internal fires found vent after the crater as a whole had\r\nceased to act. They are of the shape of huge haystacks, with a hole\r\nin the top, and looked soft and yielding in outline, and in color as\r\nthough they were composed of soot and brick-dust. One of them is\r\nmuch larger than any of the rest. I thought it might be two hundred\r\nfeet high. \"It is eight hundred,\" said our guide; yet its summit was\r\nmore than a thousand feet below the rim upon which we sat.\r\n\r\nThere has been no eruption in Haleakala since early in the last\r\ncentury. Over a large area of the interior the black lava, cracked\r\nand crumpled, meets the eye. Miles down one of its great arms toward\r\nthe sea, we could see the green lines of vegetation, mostly rank\r\nferns, advancing like an invading army. Far ahead were the\r\nskirmishers, loose bands of ferns, with individual plants here and\r\nthere pushing on over the black, uneven surface toward the secondary\r\ncraters of the centre. Vegetation was also climbing down the ragged\r\nsides of the crater, dropping from rock to rock like an invading\r\nhost. The ferns, those pioneers of the vegetable world, appear to\r\ncome first. Their giant progenitors subdued the rocks and made the\r\nsoil in Carboniferous times, and prepared the way for higher\r\nvegetable forms, and now these striplings take up the same task in\r\nthis primitive world of the crater of Haleakala. Their task is a\r\nlong and arduous one, much more so than in those parts of the island\r\nwhere the rainfall is more copious; but give them time enough, and\r\nthe barren lava will all be clothed with verdure. When decomposed\r\nand ripened by time, it makes a red, heavy soil that supports many\r\nkinds of plants and trees.\r\n\r\nThe ferns come slowly marching in from without, but in the centre of\r\nthe crater, on the slopes of the red cones and at their bases, is\r\nanother plant that seems indigenous, born of the ash and the scoria\r\nof the volcano, and that apparently has no chlorophyl in its\r\nmake-up. This is a striking plant, called the silver sword, from the\r\nshape and color of its long, narrow leaves. They are the color of\r\nfrosted silver, and are curved like a sword. It is a strange\r\napparition, white and delicate and rare, springing up in the crater\r\nof a slumbering volcano. A more striking contrast with the\r\natmosphere of the surroundings would be hard to find--a suggestion\r\nof peace and purity above the graves of world-destroying forces, an\r\nangel of light nourished by the ashes of the demons of death and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the people of the island that this plant is found\r\nin no other place on the globe, but this can hardly be possible. If\r\nits evolution took place in one crater, it would take place in\r\nanother. It consists of a great mass of silvery-white, bristling\r\nleaves resting upon the ground, from which rises a stalk, strung\r\nwith flowers, to the height of five or six feet. It is evidently of\r\nthe Yucca type of plant, and has met with a singular transformation\r\nin the sleeping volcano's mouth, all its harsh and savage character\r\nturned into gentleness and grace, its armament of needles and\r\ndaggers giving place to a soft, silvery down. We did not see the\r\nplant growing except at a great distance, through field-glasses, but\r\nwe saw a photograph of it and a dried specimen after we came down\r\nfrom the summit.\r\n\r\nIt is an all day's trip down into the crater and back, climbing over\r\nsliding sands and loose scoria, and our time was too limited to\r\nundertake it. We passed the night on the summit in a rude stone hut,\r\nwhich had a fireplace where the guide made coffee, but we had only\r\nthe volcanic rock for floor. Upon this we spread our ample supply of\r\nblankets, and got such sleep as is to be had on high, cold\r\nmountain-tops, where the ribs of the mountain prove to be so much\r\nharder than one's own ribs--not a first-class quality of sleep, but\r\nbetter than none.\r\n\r\nI arose about two o'clock, and made my way out into the star-blazing\r\nnight. Such glory of the heavens I had never before seen. I had\r\nnever before been lifted up so near them, and hence had never before\r\nseen them through so rarefied an atmosphere. The clouds and vapors\r\nhad disappeared, and all the hosts of heaven were magnified. The\r\nMilky Way seemed newly paved and swept. There was no wind and no\r\nsound. The mighty crater was a gulf of blackness, but the sky blazed\r\nwith light.\r\n\r\nThe dawn comes early on such a mountain-top, and before four o'clock\r\nwe were out under the fading stars. As we had seen the day pass into\r\nnight, surrounded by these wonderful scenes, now we saw the night\r\npass into day, and the elemental grandeur on every hand reborn\r\nbefore us. There was not a wisp of cloud or fog below us or about us\r\nto blur the great picture. The sun came up from behind the vast,\r\nlong, high wall of the Pacific that filled the eastern horizon, and\r\nthe shadows fled from the huge pile of mountain in the west. We hung\r\nabout the rim of the great crater or sat upon the jagged rocks,\r\nwrapped in our blankets, till the sun was an hour high.\r\n\r\nWe got another glimpse of the band of goats picking their way from\r\nledge to ledge far below us on the side of the crater. I saw and\r\nheard two or three mina birds fly past, apparently seeking new\r\nterritory to occupy. These birds are more enterprising than the\r\nEnglish sparrows, which also swarm in the island towns but do not\r\nbrave the mountain-heights. The bird from India seems at home\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we still haunted for an hour or more the brink of\r\nthe great abyss, where one seemed to feel the pulse of primal time,\r\nloath to tear ourselves away, loath also to take a last view of the\r\npanorama of land and sea, lit by the morning sun, which spread out\r\nfar below us. To the southeast we could dimly see the outlines of\r\nthe island of Hawaii, with a faint gleam of snow on its great\r\nmountain Mauna Loa, nearly fourteen thousand feet high. In the\r\nnorthwest a dim, dark mass low in the horizon marked the place of\r\nOahu. The ocean rose in the vast horizon and blended with the sky.\r\nThe eye could not tell where one ended and the other began.\r\n\r\nThe mules had had a comfortable night in a rude stone stable against\r\nthe rocks, and were more eager to hit the down trail than were we.\r\nThe descent proved more fatiguing than the ascent, the constant\r\nplunging motion of the animals' shoulders being a sore trial. We\r\ndropped down through the belt of clouds that had begun to form, and\r\nout into the grassy region of the singing skylarks, past herds of\r\ngrazing cattle, and at noon were again at Idlewild, resting our\r\nweary limbs and comforting the inner man.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Mr. Aiken drove us back to his home farm, where we\r\nagain passed a very pleasant night. In the morning I walked with him\r\nthrough his pineapple plantation. It was a new kind of farming and\r\nfruit-growing to me. I forget now how many hundred thousand plants\r\nhis field contained. They are set and cultivated much as cabbage is\r\nwith us, but present a strangely stiff and forbidding aspect. The\r\nfirst cutting is when the plants are about eighteen months old, one\r\nlarge solid apple from each plant. The second crop is called the\r\n\"raggoon\" crop, and yields two apples from each plant, but smaller\r\nand less valuable than the first. The field is then reset. I also\r\nwalked with Mr. Aiken over some new land he was getting ready for\r\npineapples. It had been densely covered with lantana scrub, and\r\nclearing it and grubbing it out had been an heroic task. The lantana\r\ntakes complete possession of the soil, grows about four or five feet\r\nhigh, and makes a network of roots in the soil that defies anything\r\nbut a steam plow. The soil is a red, heavy clay, and it made the\r\nfarmer in me sweat to think of the expenditure of labor necessary to\r\nturn a lantana bush into a pineapple field. The redness of this\r\nvolcanic soil is said to be owing to the fact that the growth of\r\nvegetation brings the iron into new combinations with organic acids.\r\n\r\nLater in the day we visited the large Baldwin pineapple-canning\r\nplant, and were shown the whole process of preparing and canning the\r\nfruit, and all but surfeited with the most melting and delicious\r\npineapples it was ever my good luck to taste. The Hawaiian pineapple\r\nprobably surpasses all others in tenderness and lusciousness, and it\r\nloses scarcely any of these qualities in the cans. Ripened in the\r\nfield, where it grew on the flanks of great Haleakala, and eaten out\r\nof hand, it is a dream of tropic lusciousness. The canning is done\r\nby an elaborate system of machinery managed by Japanese men and\r\nwomen, the naked hand never coming in contact with the peeled fruit,\r\nbut protected from it by long, thin rubber gloves. There ought to be\r\na great future for this industry, when Eastern consumers really find\r\nout the superior quality of the Hawaiian product.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Aiken's house one has a view of the great wall of mountains\r\nthat form the western and older--older geologically--end of the\r\nisland, in which lies the famous Iao Valley, which I have already\r\ndescribed. We judge, from the much deeper marks of rain erosion,\r\nthat this end of the island is vastly older than the butt end upon\r\nwhich Haleakala is situated. Haleakala is eroded comparatively\r\nlittle. On all its huge northern slope there is only one\r\nconsiderable gash or gully, and this is probably not many thousand\r\nyears old; but the northwestern end of the island is worn and carved\r\nin the most striking manner. Looking at it that morning, I compared\r\nit to my extended, relaxed hand, the northern end being gashed and\r\ngrooved like the sunken spaces between the fingers, while the\r\nsouthwest end, not more than ten miles distant, was only slightly\r\ngrooved and more like the solid wrist and back hand. All the rains\r\nbrought by the northeast trades fall upon the northeast end of the\r\nislands. The mountain-peaks on the end hold the clouds and strip\r\nthem dry, so that little or no rain falls upon the south and\r\nsouthwest sides. This is true of all the islands. One end of each is\r\narid and barren, while the other is wet and verdant. One of the\r\nsmaller islands, Kahoolawe, I believe, dominated by Maui on the\r\nnortheast, is said to be drying up and blowing away by inches.\r\n\r\nWhat a spell the mountains do lay upon the clouds everywhere,--the\r\nrobber mountains,--in these islands exacting the last drop of water\r\nof all the ocean-born vapors that pass over them! On the northeast\r\nside of the Lahaina district there are valleys four or five thousand\r\nfeet deep; on the southwest side there are no valleys worth\r\nmentioning. The difference in this respect was forcibly brought home\r\nto me when, later in the day, we made an automobile trip from\r\nWailuku to Lahaina on the southwest side; in going less than twenty\r\nmiles we quickly passed from the region of verdant valleys and\r\nmountain-slopes into a hard, raw, barren, unweathered region, where\r\nthere was no soil, and where the rocks looked as crude and\r\nforbidding as they must have looked the day they flowed out from the\r\ndepths as molten lava. In outline the island of Maui suggests a\r\ntruncated statue, the west end representing the head, very old and\r\nwrinkled and grooved by time and trouble, the peninsula the\r\nwell-proportioned neck, and broad-breasted Haleakala forming the\r\ntrunk. What a torso it is, fire-born and basking there in the\r\ntropic seas!\r\n\r\nThe oldest island of the Hawaiian group is Kauai, called the garden\r\nisland, because it has much the deepest and most fertile soil. It\r\nshows much more evidence of erosion than any of the other islands.\r\nThe next in point of erosion, and hence in point of age, is Oahu,\r\nupon which Honolulu is situated. Then come Molokai and Maui, the two\r\nends of the latter being of vastly unequal age. Hawaii, the largest\r\nof them all, nearly as large as Connecticut, is the youngest of the\r\ngroup, and shows the least effects of erosion. When it is as old as\r\nKauai is now, its two huge mountains, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, will\r\nprobably be cut up into deep valleys and canons and sharp, high\r\nridges, as are the mountains of Kauai and Oahu. The lapse of time\r\nrequired to bring about such a result is beyond all human\r\ncalculation. Whether one million or two millions of years would do\r\nit, who knows? Those warm tropical rains, aided by the rank\r\nvegetation which they beget and support, dissolve the volcanic rock\r\nslowly but inevitably.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of Mr. Lowell, the superintendent, we had that\r\nday the pleasure of going through a large sugar-making plant at\r\nPaia--one that turns out nearly fifty thousand tons of sugar a year.\r\nWe saw the cane come in from the fields in one end of the plant, and\r\nthe dry, warm product being put up in bags at the other. All the\r\nlatest devices and machinery for sugar-making we saw here in full\r\noperation, affording a contrast to the crude and wasteful methods I\r\nhad seen in the island of Jamaica a few years before.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we availed ourselves of the five or six miles of\r\nnarrow-gauge railway, the only one on the island, to go from Paia to\r\nWailuku, where we were met by another automobile, which hurried us\r\nto Lahaina, where we were to meet the steamer that was to convey us\r\nto Hilo, on Hawaii. I say \"hurried,\" but before the journey of\r\ntwenty-odd miles was half over, we realized the truth of the old\r\nadage, \"The more haste, the less speed.\" The automobile began to\r\nsulk and finally could be persuaded to go only on the low gear, and\r\nto rattle along at about the speed of a man with a horse and buggy.\r\nWe reached Lahaina just as the boat was entering the harbor.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we found ourselves steaming along past the high,\r\nverdant shores of Hawaii. For fifty miles or more the land presented\r\none unbroken expanse of sugar-cane, suggesting fields of some\r\ngigantic yellow-green grass. At Hilo the sun was shining between\r\nbrief showers, and the air was warm and muggy. It is said to rain\r\nthere every day in the year, and the lush vegetation made the\r\nstatement seem credible. Judge Andrews met us at the steamer, and\r\ntook us to his home for rest and dinner, and was extremely kind to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-afternoon we took the train for Glenwood, thirty miles on\r\nour way to the volcano of Kilauea. A large part of the way the road\r\nleads through sugar plantations, newly carved out of the koa and\r\ntree-fern wilderness that originally covered the volcanic soil.\r\nClusters of the little houses of the Japanese laborers, perched high\r\nabove the ground on slender posts, were passed here and there.\r\nEverywhere we saw wooden aqueducts, or flumes, winding around the\r\ncontours of the hills and across the little valleys, often on high\r\ntrestle-work, and partly filled with clear, swift-running water, in\r\nwhich the sugar-cane was transported to the mills.\r\n\r\nAt Glenwood stages meet the tourists and convey them over a fairly\r\ngood road that winds through the tree-fern forests to the Volcano\r\nHouse, ten miles away. The beauty of that fern-lined forest, the\r\nlong, stately plumes of the gigantic ferns meeting the eye\r\neverywhere, I shall not soon forget. I saw what appeared to be a\r\nlarge, showy red raspberry growing by the roadside, but I did not\r\nfind it at all tempting to the taste.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when we reached the Volcano House, and we saw off to the\r\nleft a red glow upon the fog-clouds, like the reflected light from\r\na burning barn or house in the country, and inferred at once that it\r\ncame from the volcano, which it did. From my window that night, as I\r\nlay in bed, I could see this same angry glow upon the clouds. The\r\nsmell of sulphur was in the air about the hotel, and very hot steam\r\nwas issuing from cracks in the rocks. A party of tourists on\r\nhorseback, in the spirit of true American hurry, visited the volcano\r\nthat night, but we chose to wait until the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the great crater of Kilauea was filled with fog,\r\nbut it lifted, and the sun shone before noon. We passed a pleasant\r\nforenoon strolling along the tree-fringed brink, looking down eight\r\nor nine hundred feet upon its black lava floor, and plucking ohelo\r\nberries, which grew there abundantly, a kind of large, red\r\nhuckleberry that one could eat out of hand, but that one could not\r\nget excited over. They were better in a pie than in the hand. Their\r\nname seemed to go well with the suggestion of the scenes amid which\r\nthey grew. Kilauea is a round extinct crater about three miles\r\nacross and seven or eight hundred feet deep. It has been the scene\r\nof terrific explosions in past ages, but it has now dwindled to the\r\nsmall active crater of Halemaumau, which is sunk near the middle of\r\nit like a huge pot, two hundred or more feet deep and a thousand\r\nfeet across.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-afternoon a party of eight or ten of us on horseback set\r\nout to visit the volcano. The trail led down the broken and shelving\r\nside of the crater, amid trees and bushes, till it struck the floor\r\nof lava at the bottom. In going down I was aware all the time of a\r\nbeautiful bird-song off on my left, a song almost as sweet as that\r\nof our hermit thrush, but of an entirely different order. I think it\r\nwas the song of one of the honey-suckers, a red bird with black\r\nwings that in flight looked like our scarlet tanager.\r\n\r\nOur course took us out over the cracked and contorted lava-beds,\r\nwhere no green thing was growing. The forms of the lava-flow\r\nsuggested mailed and writhing dragons, with horrid, gaping mouths\r\nand vicious claws. The lava crunched beneath the horses' feet like\r\nshelly and brittle ice. At one point we passed over a wide, jagged\r\ncrack on a bridge. As we neared the crater, the rocks grew warm, and\r\nsulphur and other fumes streaked the air.\r\n\r\nWhen a half-mile from the crater we dismounted, and, leaving our\r\nhorses in charge of the guide, proceeded on foot over the cracked\r\nand heated lava rocks toward the brink of this veritable devil's\r\ncaldron. The sulphur fumes are so suffocating that it can be\r\napproached only on the windward side. The first glance into that\r\nfearful pit is all that your imagination can picture it. You look\r\nupon the traditional lake of brimstone and fire, and if devils were\r\nto appear skipping about over the surface with pitchforks, turning\r\ntheir victims as the cook turns her frying crullers in the\r\nsputtering fat, it would not much astonish you. This liquid is\r\nrather thick and viscid, but it is boiling furiously. Great masses\r\nof it are thrown up forty or fifty feet, and fall with a crash like\r\nthat of the surf upon the shore. Livid jets are thrown up many feet\r\nhigh against the sides and drip back, cooling quickly as the lava\r\ndescends. We sat or stood upon the brink, at times almost letting\r\nour feet hang over the sides, and shielding our faces from the\r\nintense heat with paper masks and veils. It is probably the only\r\nplace in the world where you can come face to face with the heart of\r\nan active volcano. There are no veils of vapor to hide it from you.\r\nIt appears easy enough to cast a stone into the midst of it, but\r\nnone of us could quite do it.\r\n\r\nThe mass of boiling lava is said to be about one and one half acres\r\nin extent. Its surface is covered with large masses of floating\r\ncrust, black and smooth, like leather or roofing-paper, and between\r\nthese masses, or islands, the molten lava shows in broad, vivid\r\nlines. It is never quiet. When not actually boiling, there is a slow\r\ncirculatory movement, and the great flakes of black crust,\r\nsuggesting scum, drift across from one end to the other and are\r\ndrawn under the rocks. At one moment only this movement is apparent,\r\nthen suddenly the mass begins to boil furiously all over the\r\nsurface, and you hear dimly the sound of the bursting bubbles and\r\nthe crash of the falling lava. When this takes place, the black\r\nfloating masses are broken up and scattered as they are in boiling\r\nmaple-syrup, but they quickly reunite, and are carried on by the\r\ncurrent as before.\r\n\r\nLooking upon this scene with the thought of the traditional lake of\r\nfire and brimstone of our forefathers in mind, you would say that\r\nthese black, filthy-looking masses floating about on the surface\r\nwere the accumulation of all the bad stuff that had been fried out\r\nof the poor sinners since hell was invented. How much wickedness and\r\nuncharity and evil thought it would represent! If the poor victims\r\nwere clarified and made purer by the process, then it would seem\r\nworth while.\r\n\r\nAt the Volcano House they keep a book in which tourists write down\r\ntheir impressions of the volcano. A distinguished statesman had been\r\nthere a few days before us, and had written a long account of his\r\nimpressions, closing with this oratorical sentence: \"No pen, however\r\ngifted, can describe, no brush, however brilliant, can portray, the\r\nwonders we have been permitted to behold.\" I could not refrain from\r\nwriting under it, \"I have seen the orthodox hell, and it's the real\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nThat huge kettle of molten metal, mantling and bubbling, how it is\r\nimpressed upon my memory! It is a vestige of the ancient cosmic fire\r\nthat once wrapped the whole globe in its embrace. It had a kind of\r\nbrutal fascination. One could not take one's eyes from it. That\r\nnetwork of broad, jagged, fiery lines defining those black, smooth\r\nmasses, or islands, of floating matter told of a side of nature we\r\nhad never before seen. We lingered there on the brink of the fearful\r\nspectacle till night came on, and the sides of the mighty caldron,\r\nand the fog-clouds above it, glowed in the infernal light. Not so\r\nwhite as the metal pouring from a blast furnace, not so hot, a more\r\nsullen red, but welling up from the central primordial fires of the\r\nearth. This great pot has boiled over many times in the recent past,\r\nas the lava-beds we traveled over testify, and it will probably boil\r\nover again. It has been unusually active these last few years.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock we rode back, facing a cold, driving mist, the\r\nback of each rider, protected by the shining yellow \"slickers,\"\r\nglowing to the one behind him, in the volcano's light, till we were\r\na mile or more away.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came clear, and the sight of the mighty slope of\r\nMauna Loa, lit up by the rising sun, was a grand spectacle. It\r\nlooked gentle and easy of ascent, wooded here and there, and here\r\nand there showing broad, black streaks from the lava overflows at\r\nthe summit in recent years; but remembering that it was nearly four\r\nthousand feet higher than Haleakala, I had no desire to climb it.\r\nThis mountain and its companion, Mauna Kea, are the highest island\r\nmountains in the world.\r\n\r\nThe stage rolled us back through the fern forest to the railway\r\nstation and thence on to Hilo again, where in good time, in the\r\nafternoon, we went aboard the steamer; and the next morning we were\r\nagain in the harbor of Honolulu, glad we had made the inter-island\r\ntrip, and above all glad that we had seen Haleakala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ICE-FLOOD\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was a bold man who first conceived the idea of the great\r\ncontinental ice-sheet which in Pleistocene times covered most of the\r\nnorthern part of the continent, and played such a part in shaping\r\nthe land as we know it. That bold man was Agassiz, who, however, was\r\nnot bold enough to accept the theory of evolution as propounded by\r\nDarwin. The idea of the great glacier did not conflict with\r\nAgassiz's religious predilections, and the theory of evolution did.\r\nIt was a bold generalization, this of the continental ice-sheet, one\r\nof the master-strokes of the scientific imagination. It was about\r\nthe year 1840 that Agassiz, fresh from the glaciers of the Alps,\r\nwent to Scotland looking for the tracks of the old glaciers, and he\r\nfound them at once when he landed near Glasgow. We can all find them\r\nnow on almost every walk we take to the fields and hills; but until\r\nour eyes are opened, how blind we are to them! We are like people\r\nwho camp on the trail of an army and never suspect an army has\r\npassed, though the ruts made by their wagons and artillery and the\r\nruins of their intrenchments are everywhere visible.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a boy on the farm we never asked ourselves questions\r\nabout the stones and rocks that encumbered the land--whence they\r\ncame, or what the agency was that brought them. The farmers believed\r\nthe land was created just as we saw it--stones, boulders, soil,\r\ngravel-pits, hills, mountains, and all--and doubtless wished in\r\ntheir hearts that the Creator had not been so particular about the\r\nrocks and stones, or had made an exception in favor of their own\r\nfields. Rocks and stones were good for fences and foundations, and\r\nfor various other uses, but they were a great hindrance to the\r\ncultivation of the soil. I once heard a farmer boast that he had\r\nvery strong land--it had to be strong to hold up such a crop of\r\nrocks and stones. When the Eastern farmer moved west into the\r\nprairie states, or south into the cotton-growing states, he probably\r\nnever asked himself why the Creator had not cumbered the ground with\r\nrocks and stones in those sections, as he had in New York and New\r\nEngland. South of the line that runs irregularly through middle New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and so on to\r\nthe Rockies, he will find few loose stones scattered over the soil,\r\nno detached boulders sitting upon the surface, no hills or mounds of\r\ngravel and sand, no clay banks packed full of rounded stones, little\r\nand big, no rocky floors under the soil which look as if they had\r\nbeen dressed down by a huge but dulled and nicked jack-plane. The\r\nreason is that the line I have indicated marks the limit of the old\r\nice-sheet which more than a hundred thousand years ago covered all\r\nthe northern part of the continent to a depth of from two to four\r\nthousand feet, and was the chief instrument in rounding off\r\nmountain-tops, scattering rock-fragments, little and big, over our\r\nlandscapes, grinding down and breaking off the protruding rock\r\nstrata, building up our banks of mingled clay and stone, changing\r\nthe courses of streams and rivers, deepening and widening our\r\nvalleys, transplanting boulders of one formation for hundreds of\r\nmiles, and dropping them upon the surface of another formation. When\r\nit began to melt and retreat, it was the chief agent in building up\r\nour river terraces, and our long, low, rounded hills of sand and\r\ngravel and clay, called kames and drumlins. In many of our valleys\r\nits flowing waters left long, low ridges, gentle in outline, made up\r\nentirely of sand and gravel, or of clay. In other places it left\r\nmoraines made up of earth, gravel, and rock-fragments that make a\r\nvery rough streak through the farmer's land. All those high, level\r\nterraces along the Hudson, such as that upon which West Point\r\nstands, were the work of the old ice-sheet that once filled the\r\nriver valley. The melting ice was also the chief agent in building\r\nup the enormous clay-banks that are found along the shores of the\r\nHudson. The clay formed in very still waters, the sand and gravel in\r\nmore active waters.\r\n\r\nThis great ice-sheet not only covered our northern farms with rocks\r\nand stones, and packed the soil with rounded boulders, but it also\r\ncarried away much of the rock decay that goes to the making of the\r\nsoil, so that the soil is of greater depth in the non-glaciated than\r\nin the glaciated areas of the country. The New-Englander or\r\nNew-Yorker in traveling in the Southern States may note the enormous\r\ndepth of soil as revealed by the water-courses or railroad cuts. The\r\nice-sheet was a huge mill that ground up the rocks in the North\r\nprobably as fast or faster than the rains and the rank vegetation\r\nreduced them in the South, but the floods of water which it finally\r\nlet loose carried a great deal of the rock-waste into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe glacier milk which colors the streams that flow from beneath it\r\nfinally settles and makes clay. Off the great Malaspina Glacier in\r\nAlaska the ocean is tinged by the glacier milk for nearly fifty\r\nmiles from the shores. Very few country people, even among the\r\neducated, are ready to believe that this enormous ice-sheet ever\r\nexisted. To make them believe that it is just as much a fact in the\r\nphysical history of this continent as the war of the Revolution is a\r\nfact in our political history is no easy matter. It certainly is a\r\ncrushing proposition. It so vastly transcends all our experience\r\nwith ice and snow, or the experience of the race since the dawn of\r\nhistory, that only the scientific imagination and faith are equal to\r\nit. The belief in it rests on indubitable evidence, its record is\r\nwritten all over our landscape, but it requires, I say, the\r\nscientific imagination to put the facts together and make a\r\ncontinuous history.\r\n\r\nThree or four hundred feet above my cabin, five or six hundred feet\r\nabove tidewater, there is a bold rocky point upon which the old\r\nice-sheet bore heavily. It has rubbed it down and flattened it as a\r\nhand passing over a knob of soft putty might do. The great hand in\r\nthis case moved from the northeast and must have fairly made this\r\nrocky prominence groan with its weight. The surface, scratched and\r\ngrooved and planed by the ice, has weathered away, leaving the rock\r\nquite rough; its general outlines alone tell the tale of the battle\r\nwith the ice. But on the east side a huge mass of rock, that had\r\nbeen planed and gouged by the glacier, was detached and toppled\r\nover, turning topsy-turvy before it had weathered, and it lies in\r\nsuch a position, upheld by two rock fragments, that its glaciated\r\nsurface, though protected from the weather, is clearly visible. You\r\nstep down two or three feet between the two upholding rocks and are\r\nat the entrance of a little cave, and there before you, standing at\r\nan angle of thirty or forty degrees, is this rocky page written over\r\nwith the history of the passing of the great ice plane. The surface\r\nexposed is ten or twelve feet long, and four or five feet wide, and\r\nit is as straight and smooth, and the scratches and grooves are as\r\nsharp and distinct as if made yesterday. I often take the college\r\ngirls there who come to visit me, to show them, as I tell them,\r\nwhere the old ice gods left their signatures. The girls take turns\r\nin stooping down and looking along the under surface of the rock,\r\nand feeling it with their hands, and marveling. They have read or\r\nheard about these things, but the reading or hearing made little\r\nimpression upon their minds. When they see a concrete example, and\r\nfeel it with their hands, they are impressed. Then when I tell them\r\nthat there is not a shadow of a doubt but that the ice was at one\r\ntime two or three thousand feet thick above the place where they now\r\nstand, and that it bore down upon Julian's Rock with a weight of\r\nthousands of tons to the square foot, that it filled all the Hudson\r\nRiver Valley, and covered the landscape for thousands of miles\r\naround them, riding over the tops of the Catskills and of the\r\nAdirondacks, and wearing them down and carrying fragments of rock\r\ntorn from them hundreds of miles to the south and southwest,--when\r\nI have told them all of this, I have usually given them a mouthful\r\ntoo big for them to masticate or swallow. As a sort of abstract\r\nproposition contained in books, or heard in the classroom, they do\r\nnot mind it, but as an actual fact, here in the light of common day\r\non the hill above Slabsides, with the waters of the Hudson\r\nglistening below, and the trees rustling in the wind all about us,\r\nthat is quite another matter. It sounds like a dream or a fable.\r\nMany of the processes that have made our globe what we see it have\r\nbeen so slow and on such a scale that they are quite beyond our\r\nhorizon--beyond the reach of our mental apprehension. The mind has\r\nto approach them slowly and tentatively, and become familiar with\r\nthe idea of them, before it can give any sort of rational assent to\r\nthem. It has taken the geologist a long time to work out and clear\r\nup and confirm this conception of the great continental glacier\r\nwhich in Pleistocene times covered so large a part of the northern\r\nhemisphere. It is now as well established as any event in the remote\r\npast well can be. In Alaska, and in the Swiss Alps, one may see the\r\nice doing exactly what the Pleistocene ice-sheet did over this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day in passing a farmer's house I saw where he had placed\r\na huge, roundish boulder, nearly as high as a man's head, by the\r\nroadside and had cut upon it his own name and date, and that of his\r\nfather before him, and that of the first settler upon the farm, in\r\nthe latter part of the eighteenth century. It was an interesting\r\nmonument. I learned that the rock had been found in the bed of a\r\nsmall creek near by, and that the farmer had given a hundred dollars\r\nto have it moved to its place in front of his house. Had I seen the\r\nold farmer I am sure I could have added to his interest and pride in\r\nhis monument by telling him that it was Adiron-dack gneiss, and had\r\nbeen brought from that region on the back, or in the maw, of a\r\nglacier, many tens of thousands of years ago. But it is highly\r\nprobable that, were he an uneducated man, he would have treated my\r\nstatement with contempt or incredulity. Education does at least this\r\nfor a man: it opens his mind and makes him less skeptical about\r\nthings not dreamed of in his philosophy.\r\n\r\nThis boulder had been rolled and worn in its long, slow ride till it\r\nwas nearly round. I have a much smaller boulder, probably from the\r\nsame quarry, which I planted at the head of my garden for a seat\r\nwhen the hoe gets tired. When it was dropped here on the land that\r\nis now my field, the bed and valley of the Hudson were occupied by\r\nthe old glacier which, during its decline and recession, built up\r\nthe terraces opposite me (where now stands a multimillionaire's copy\r\nof an Italian palace), and which added to and uncovered the river\r\nslopes where now my own vineyards are planted.\r\n\r\nThe flowing or the creeping of this old ice-sheet, so that it could\r\ntransport large boulders hundreds of miles, is one of the most\r\nremarkable things about it: as slow or slower than the hour-hand of\r\nthe clock, yet an actual progression, carrying it, in the course of\r\nthousands of years, from its apex in Labrador well down into New\r\nJersey, where its terminal moraine is still clearly traceable.\r\n\r\nA river of ice, under the right conditions, flows as literally as a\r\nriver of water, fastest in the middle, and slowest along its margins\r\nwhere the friction is greatest. The old ice-sheet, or ice sea,\r\nflowed around and over mountains as a river flows around and over\r\nrocks. Where a mountain rose above the glacier, the ice divided and\r\nflowed round it, and reunited again beyond it. One may see all this\r\nin Alaska at the present time. Water, of course, flows because of\r\nits own pressure; so does ice, only the pressure has to be vastly\r\ngreater. A drop of water on the table does not flow, but, pile it\r\nhigh enough, and it will. The old ice sea flowed mainly south, not\r\nbecause it was downhill in that direction, but because the\r\naccumulation of ice and snow at the North was so great. If through\r\nany climatic changes, the snowfall were ever again to be so great\r\nthat more snow should fall in winter than could melt in summer,\r\nafter the lapse of thousands of years, we should have another ice\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE FRIENDLY SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI never tire of contemplating the soil itself, the mantle rock, as\r\nthe geologist calls it. It clothes the rocky framework of the earth\r\nas the flesh clothes our bones. It is the seat of the vitality of\r\nthe globe, the youngest part, the growing, changing part. Out of it\r\nwe came, and to it we return. It is literally our mother, as the sun\r\nis our father.\r\n\r\nThe soil!--the residuum of the rocks, the ashes of the mountains. We\r\nknow what a vast stretch of time has gone to the making of it; that\r\nit has been baked and boiled and frozen and thawed, acted upon by\r\nsun and star and wind and rain; mixed and remixed and kneaded and\r\nadded to, as the housewife kneads and moulds her bread; that it has\r\nlain under the seas in the stratified rocks for incalculable ages;\r\nthat chemical and mechanical and vital forces have all had a hand in\r\nits preparation; that the vast cycles of animal and vegetable life\r\nof the foreworld have contributed to its fertility; that the life of\r\nthe sea, and the monsters of the earth, and the dragons of the air,\r\nhave left their ashes here, so that when I stir it with my hoe, or\r\nturn it with my spade, I know I am stirring or turning the meal of a\r\nveritable grist of the gods.\r\n\r\nFrom its primal source in the Archaean rock, up through all the vast\r\nseries of sedimentary rocks to our own time, what vicissitudes and\r\ntransformations it has passed through; how many times it has died,\r\nso to speak, and been reborn from the rocks; how many times the\r\nwinds and the rains have transported it, and infused invisible,\r\nlife-giving gases into it; how many of the elements have throbbed\r\nwith life, climbed and bloomed in trees, walked or flown or swam in\r\nanimals, or slumbered for thousands upon thousands of years beneath\r\nthe great ice-sheet of Pleistocene time! A handful of the soil by\r\nyour door is probably the most composite thing you can find in a\r\nday's journey. It may be an epitome of a whole geological formation,\r\nor of two or more of them. If it happens to be made up of decomposed\r\nlimestone, sandstone, slate, and basalt rock, think what a history\r\nwould be condensed in it!\r\n\r\nOur lawns are made up of ashes from the funeral pyre of mountains,\r\nof dust from the tombs of geologic ages. What masses of rock does\r\nthis sandbank represent! what an enormous grist in the great glacier\r\nmill do these layers of clay stand for! Two feet of soil probably\r\nrepresent a hundred feet or more of rock. Strictly speaking, the\r\nsoil is the insoluble parts of the ground-up and decomposed rocks,\r\nafter the rains and the winds have done their work and taken their\r\ntoll of the grist they have ground. Sometimes these mills take the\r\nwhole grist and leave the rocks bare; but usually they leave a\r\nresiduum in which life strikes its roots. We do not see all that the\r\nwaters take from the soil. They have invisible pockets in which they\r\ncarry away all the more soluble parts, such as lime, soda, potash,\r\nsilica, magnesia, and others, and leave for the land the more\r\ninsoluble parts. These, too, in times of flood they carry away in\r\nsuspension, in the shape of sand, silt, mud, gravel, and the like.\r\nWhen the waters really digest the rocks, they hold the various\r\nminerals in solution, and run limpid and dancing to the sea; when\r\nthey have an undigested burden, they run angry and turbid.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the Hudson River deposits in the sea each year\r\nfour hundred and forty thousand tons of mineral matter in solution\r\nwhich it has taken from the land, and the Mississippi one hundred\r\nand twelve million tons. Each carries away about four times as much\r\nin suspension. The digestive or chemical power of water, then, is\r\nonly about one fourth as great as its mechanical power. Between the\r\ntwo the land is made to pay heavy toll to the sea. But in time, in\r\ngeologic time, it all comes back. The suspended particles are\r\ndropped and go to make up the sedimentary rocks, while the solutes\r\nhelp cement the material of these rocks together, and also nourish\r\nthe sea life from which limestone and other organic rocks are made.\r\nWhen these rocks are again lifted to the surface and disintegrated\r\ninto soil, then the debt of the sea to the land is paid. This\r\nprocess, this cycle of soil loss and soil growth, has gone on\r\nthrough all time, and must continue as long as the rain continues to\r\nfall, or as long as the sea continues to send its tax-gatherers to\r\nthe land. In this great cycle of give and take of the elements, the\r\naffairs of men cut but a momentary figure; how puny they are, how\r\ntransient! How the great changes, which in time amount to\r\nrevolutions, go on over our heads and under our feet, and we rarely\r\nheed them, and are powerless to stay them! A summer shower carries\r\nthe soil of my side-hill, which is mainly disintegrated Silurian\r\nrock and shale, into the river, and some millions of years hence,\r\nwhen it has become stratified rock, and been lifted up into the\r\nlight of day, some other, and, I trust, wiser husbandman, will be\r\ngathering his harvest from it, and be worried over the downpour that\r\nrobs him of it. The farmer's worry is bound to come back with the\r\nsoil, and be passed along with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nPRIMAL ENERGIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow puny and meagre is the utmost power man can put forth, even by\r\nthe aid of all his mechanical appliances, when compared with the\r\nprimal earth forces! Think, or try to think, of the force of\r\npressure that causes the rock-strata to buckle or crumple or\r\nbend--layers of rock, thousands of feet thick, made to fold and bend\r\nlike the leaves of a book--vast mountain-chains flexed and\r\nforeshortened, or ruptured and faulted as the bending of one's body\r\nwrinkles or rips one's clothes. Think of the over-thrusts and the\r\nfolding and shearing of the earth's crust. The shrinking of the\r\nearth squeezes the rocks to an extent quite beyond our power of\r\nconception. \"So overpowering has been the horizontal movement in\r\nsome cases,\" says Dana, \"that masses of rock thousands of feet in\r\nthickness have been buckled up and sheared, or, simply yielding to\r\npressure, have sheared without folding, and been thrust forward for\r\nmiles along a gently inclined plane. These great reversed faults are\r\ntermed over-thrusts or thrust-planes. Sometimes such thrust-planes\r\noccur singly, at other times the rocks have yielded again and again,\r\ngreat sheets having been sliced off successively, and driven forward\r\none upon the other.\" In northern Montana there is an over-thrust of\r\nthe Cambrian rocks upon the late Cretaceous, of seven or eight\r\nmiles, carrying with it what is now called \"Chief Mountain,\" which\r\nhas been carved out of the extreme end of the over-thrust. The\r\ncontemplation of such things gives one a sense of power in Nature\r\nbeyond anything else I know of. The shrinking of the globe as a\r\nwhole makes its rocky garment too big for it, and this titanic\r\nwrinkling and folding results. When the strata snap asunder under\r\nthe strain, we have earthquakes. During the recent San Francisco\r\nearthquake, Mount Tamalpais, across the bay, and all the neighboring\r\nheights, were permanently shifted eight or ten feet. The sides of\r\nthe mountain, it is said, undulated like a curtain. And this shaking\r\nand twitching of the great rocky skin of the earth was vastly less,\r\nin proportion to the size of the globe, than the twitching and\r\ntrembling of the skin of a horse when he would shake off the flies,\r\nin comparison with the animal's body.\r\n\r\nWe see another exhibition of the magnitude of the earth's forces in\r\nwhat the geologist calls a \"laccolite\"--a great cave or cistern deep\r\nbeneath the surface of stratified rock filled with hardened lava.\r\nThe lava is forced up from an unknown depth under such pressure\r\nthat, not finding an outlet at the surface, the rock strata,\r\nhundreds or thousands of feet thick, are lifted up and arched like\r\nso much paper, and in the cavity thus formed the pent-up molten lava\r\nfinds relief. These lava cisterns or pockets are sometimes uncovered\r\nby the process of erosion. The Henry Mountains in Utah are all\r\nlaccolites. One of them, Mount Hillers, has a volume of about ten\r\ncubic miles. Much of the overarching sedimentary strata still covers\r\nit. Geologists read the evidence of a similar formation called a\r\n\"sill\" on the west side of the Hudson in New Jersey, forming the\r\nPalisades. The lava worked like a giant mole up through and then\r\nbeneath the Triassic sandstone, lifting the strata up and arching\r\nthem over a large area. During the millions of years that have\r\nelapsed since that time, the layers of superincumbent sandstone have\r\nbeen worn away so that now one sees a wide, smooth, gentle slope of\r\nbasaltic rock covered by a very thin coat of soil. As one goes by on\r\nthe train, one sees where the workmen of a stone-crushing plant have\r\ncut into the slope and uncovered the junction of the two kinds of\r\nrock, one born of water, and one born of fire. The igneous rock sits\r\nsquarely upon the level sandstone, like a row of upright books\r\nstanding upon a shelf. I never pass the place but that I want to\r\nstop the train and get out and have a close look at the precise spot\r\nwhere this son of Vulcan sat down so heavily and so hot upon his\r\nbrother of the sedimentary deposits.\r\n\r\nProbably no two chapters of the earth's history differ more than\r\nthose of the two sides of the Hudson at New York. There is a great\r\nbreak here--a leap from Archaean times on the east side to Mesozoic\r\ntimes on the west. The east side is millions of years the older.\r\nHere is the original Plutonic or Azoic rock which apparently has\r\nnever been under the sea since it was first thrust up out of the\r\nfiery depths. The west shore, including the Palisades, belongs to a\r\nmuch later geologic era. The original granite here is buried under\r\nvast deposits of sedimentary rock of the Triassic age--the age of\r\nthe giant reptiles, the remains of one of which has recently been\r\nfound embedded in this sandstone, near the river's edge. As the\r\ntraveler's eye follows along the even, almost level line of this\r\nescarpment of the Palisades, let it re-create for him the strata of\r\nthe old Triassic sandstone that were millions of years ago piled\r\nhigh upon it,--how high can only be conjectured,--but which have\r\nbeen removed grain by grain under the eroding power of the forces of\r\nair and water that now seem to caress the huge wall so gently. Ah!\r\ngeologic Time, what can it not do? what has it not done? The old\r\nsill of Vulcan now presents a nearly vertical front to the Hudson,\r\nforming the Palisades, showing that some leaves of the earth's\r\nhistory here are missing, buried probably beneath the waters of the\r\nriver. There is evidently a line of fault here, and the west side\r\nhas been lifted up out of the old Mesozoic seas, probably in the\r\nconvulsions that poured out the lava of the trap rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC FAITH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find myself accepting certain things on the authority of science\r\nwhich so far transcend my experience, and the experience of the race\r\nand all the knowledge of the world, in fact which come so near being\r\nunthinkable, that I call my acceptance of them an act of scientific\r\nfaith. One's reason may be convinced and yet the heart refuse to\r\nbelieve. It is not so much a question of evidence as a question of\r\ncapacity to receive evidence of an unusual kind.\r\n\r\nOne of the conclusions of science which I feel forced to accept, and\r\nyet which I find very hard work to believe, is that of the animal\r\norigin of man. I suppose my logical faculties are convinced, but\r\nwhat is that in me that is baffled, and that hesitates and demurs?\r\n\r\nThe idea of the origin of man from some lower form requires such a\r\nplunge into the past, and such a faith in the transforming power of\r\nthe biological laws, and in the divinity that lurks in the soil\r\nunderfoot and streams from the orbs overhead, that the ordinary mind\r\nis quite unequal to the task. For the book of Genesis of the old\r\nBible we have substituted the book of genesis of the rocky scripture\r\nof the globe--a book torn and mutilated, that has been through fire\r\nand flood and earthquake shock, that has been in the sea and on the\r\nheights, and that only the palaeontologist can read or decipher\r\ncorrectly, but which is a veritable bible of the succession of life\r\non the earth. The events of the days of creation are recorded here,\r\nbut they are days of such length that they are to be reckoned only\r\nin millions of years.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the horse, according to the best and latest\r\nresearch, from the eohippus of Eocene times--a small mammal no\r\nlarger than the fox--to the proud and fleet creature that we prize\r\nto-day, occupied four or five millions of years. Think of that first\r\nknown progenitor of the horse as never dying, but living on through\r\nthe geological ages and being slowly, oh, so slowly, modified by its\r\nenvironment, changing its teeth, its hoofs, enlarging its body,\r\nlengthening its limbs, and so on, till it becomes the horse we know\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nIn accepting the theory of the animal origin of man we have got to\r\nfollow man back, not only till we find him a naked savage like the\r\nFuegians as Darwin describes them,--naked, bedaubed with paint, with\r\nmatted hair and looks wild and distrustful,--but we cannot stop\r\nthere, we must follow him back till he becomes a troglodyte, a\r\ncave-dweller, contending with the cave bear, the cave lion, and the\r\nhyena for the possession of this rude shelter; back still, till we\r\nfind him in trees living like the anthropoid apes; then back to the\r\nearth again to some four-footed creature, probably of the marsupial\r\nkind; still the trail leads downward and ever downward, till we lose\r\nit in that maze of marine forms that swarm in the Palaeozoic seas,\r\nor until the imagination is baffled and refuses to proceed. It\r\ncertainly is a hard proposition, and it puts one upon his mettle to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\nShould we not find equal difficulty in believing the life-history of\r\neach one of us,--the start in the germ, then the vague suggestion of\r\nfish, and frog, and reptile, in our foetal life,--were it not a\r\nmatter of daily experience? Let it be granted that the race of man\r\nwas born as literally out of the animal forms below him as the child\r\nis born out of these vague, prenatal animal forms in its mother's\r\nwomb. Yet the former fact so far transcends our experience, and even\r\nour power of imagination, that we can receive it only by an act of\r\nscientific faith, as our fathers received the dogmas of the Church\r\nby an act of religious faith.\r\n\r\nI confess that I find it hard work to get on intimate terms with\r\nevolution, familiarize my mind with it, and make it thinkable. The\r\ngulf that separates man from the orders below him is so impassable,\r\nhis intelligence is so radically different from theirs, and his\r\nprogress so enormous, while they have stood still, that believing it\r\nis like believing a miracle. That the apparently blind groping and\r\nexperimentation which mark the course of evolution as revealed by\r\npalaeontology--the waste, the delay, the vicissitudes, the\r\nhit-and-miss method--should have finally resulted in this supreme\r\nanimal, man, puts our scientific faith to the test. In the light of\r\nevolution how the halo with which we have surrounded our origin\r\nvanishes!\r\n\r\nMan has from the earliest period believed himself of divine origin,\r\nand by the divine he has meant something far removed from this earth\r\nand all its laws and processes, something quite transcending the\r\nmundane forces. He has invented or dreamed myths and legends to\r\nthrow the halo of the exceptional, the far removed, the mystical, or\r\nthe divine around his origin. He has spurned the clod with his foot;\r\nhe has denied all kinship with bird and beast around him, and looked\r\nto the heavens above for the sources of his life. And then unpitying\r\nscience comes along and tells him that he is under the same law as\r\nthe life he treads under foot, and that that law is adequate to\r\ntransform the worm into the man; that he, too, has groveled in the\r\ndust, or wallowed in the slime, or fought and reveled, a reptile\r\namong reptiles; that the heavens above him, to which he turns with\r\nsuch awe and reverence, or such dread and foreboding, are the source\r\nof his life and hope in no other sense than they are the source of\r\nthe life and hope of all other creatures. But this is the way of\r\nscience; it enhances the value or significance of everything about\r\nus that we are wont to treat as cheap or vulgar, and it discounts\r\nthe value of the things far off upon which we have laid such stress.\r\nIt ties us to the earth, it calls in the messengers we send forth\r\ninto the unknown; it makes the astonishing revelation--\r\nrevolutionary revelation, I may say--that the earth is embosomed in\r\nthe infinite heavens the same as the stars that shine above us, that\r\nthe creative energy is working now and here underfoot, the same as\r\nin the ages of myth and miracle; in other words, that God is really\r\nimmanent in his universe, and inseparable from it; that we have been\r\nin heaven and under the celestial laws all our lives, and knew it\r\nnot. Science thus kills religion, poetry, and romance only so far as\r\nit dispels our illusions and brings us back from the imaginary to\r\nthe common and the near at hand. It discounts heaven in favor of\r\nearth. It should make us more at home in the world, and more\r\nconscious of the daily beauty and wonders that surround us, and, if\r\nit does not, the trouble is probably in the ages of myth and fable\r\nthat lie behind us and that have left their intoxicating influence\r\nin our blood.\r\n\r\nWe are willing to be made out of the dust of the earth when God\r\nmakes us, the God we have made ourselves out of our dreams and fears\r\nand aspirations, but we are not willing to be made out of the dust\r\nof the earth when the god called Evolution makes us. An impersonal\r\nlaw or process we cannot revere or fear or worship or exalt; we can\r\nonly study it and put it to the test. We can love or worship only\r\npersonality. This is why science puts such a damper upon us; it\r\nbanishes personality, as we have heretofore conceived it, from the\r\nuniverse. The thunder is no longer the voice of God, the earth is no\r\nlonger his footstool. Personality appears only in man; the universe\r\nis not inhuman, but unhuman. It is this discovery that we recoil\r\nfrom, and blame science for; and until, in the process of time, we\r\nshall have adjusted our minds, and especially our emotions, to it,\r\nmankind will still recoil from it.\r\n\r\nWe love our dreams, our imaginings, as we love a prospect before our\r\nhouses. We love an outlook into the ideal, the unknown in our lives.\r\nBut we love also to feel the solid ground beneath our feet.\r\n\r\nWhether life loses in charm as we lose our illusions, and whether it\r\ngains in power and satisfaction as we more and more reach solid\r\nground in our beliefs, is a question that will be answered\r\ndifferently by different persons.\r\n\r\nWe have vastly more solid knowledge about the universe amid which we\r\nlive than had our fathers, but are we happier, better, stronger? May\r\nit not be said that our lives consist, not in the number of things\r\nwe know any more than in the number of things we possess, but in the\r\nthings we love, in the depth and sincerity of our emotions, and in\r\nthe elevation of our aspirations? Has not science also enlarged the\r\nsphere of our love, and given us new grounds for wonder and\r\nadmiration? It certainly has, but it as certainly has put a damper\r\nupon our awe, our reverence, our veneration. However valuable these\r\nemotions are, and whatever part they may have played in the\r\ndevelopment of character in the past, they seem doomed to play less\r\nand less part in the future. Poetry and religion, so called, seem\r\ndoomed to play less and less part in the life of the race in the\r\nfuture. We shall still dream and aspire, but we shall not tremble\r\nand worship as in the past.\r\n\r\nWe see about us daily transformations as stupendous as that of the\r\nevolution of man from the lower animals, and we marvel not. We see\r\nthe inorganic pass into the organic, we see iron and lime and potash\r\nand silex blush in the flowers, sweeten in the fruit, ripen in the\r\ngrain, crimson in the blood, and we marvel not. We see the spotless\r\npond-lily rising and unfolding its snowy petals, and its trembling\r\nheart of gold, from the black slime of the pond. We contemplate our\r\nown life-history as shown in our pre-natal life, and we are not\r\ndisturbed. But when we stretch this process out through the geologic\r\nages and try to see ourselves a germ, a fish, a reptile, in the womb\r\nof time, we are balked. We do not see the great mother, or the great\r\nfather, or feel the lift of the great biologic laws. We are beyond\r\nour depth. It is easy to believe that the baby is born of woman,\r\nbecause it is a matter of daily experience, but it is not easy to\r\nbelieve that man is born of the animal world below him, and that\r\nthat is born of inorganic Nature, because the fact is too big and\r\ntremendous.\r\n\r\nWhat we call Nature works in no other way; one law is over big and\r\nlittle alike. What Nature does in a day typifies what she does in an\r\neternity. It is when we reach the things done on such an enormous\r\nscale of time and power and size that we are helpless. The almost\r\ninfinitely slow transformations that the theory of evolution demands\r\nbalk us as do the size and distance of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\nNo observation or study of evolution on a small scale and near at\r\nhand in the familiar facts of the life about us can prepare us for\r\nit, any more than lake and river can prepare us for the ocean, or\r\nthe modeling of miniature valleys and mountains by the rain in the\r\nclay bank can open our minds to receive the tremendous facts of the\r\ncarving of the face of the continent by the same agents.\r\n\r\nWe do not see evolution working in one day, or in a century, or in\r\nmany centuries. Neither do we catch the gods of erosion at their\r\nHerculean tasks. They always seem to be having a holiday, or else to\r\nbe merely toying with their work.\r\n\r\nWhen we see a mound of earth or a bank of clay worn into miniature\r\nmountain-chains and canons and gulches by the rains of a season, we\r\ndo not doubt our eyes; we know the rains did it. But when we see the\r\nsame thing copied in a broad landscape, or on the face of a state or\r\na continent, we find it hard to believe the evidence of our own\r\nsenses. The scale upon which it is done, and the time involved, put\r\nit so far beyond the sphere of our experience that something in us,\r\nprobably the practical, everyday man, refuses to be convinced.\r\n\r\nThe lay mind can hardly have any adequate conception of the part\r\nerosion, the simple weathering of the rocks, has played in shaping\r\nour landscapes, and in preparing the earth for the abode of man. The\r\nchanges in the surface of the land in one's lifetime, or even in the\r\nhistoric period, are so slight that the tales the geologists tell us\r\nare incredible.\r\n\r\nWhen, during a recent trip through the great Southwest, I saw the\r\nearth laid open by erosion as I had never before dreamed of,\r\nespecially when I visited those halls of the gods, the Grand Canon\r\nand Yosemite Valley, I found my capacity to believe in the erosive\r\npower of water and the weather quite overtaxed. It must be true, I\r\nsaid, what the geologists tell us, that water and air did all this;\r\nbut while you look and wait, and while generations before you have\r\nlooked and waited, all is as quiet and passive as if the slumber of\r\nages wrapped hill and vale. Invisible giants have wrought and delved\r\nhere of whom we never catch a glimpse, nor shall we, wait and watch\r\nwe never so long. No sound of their hammers or picks or shovels or\r\nof the dynamite ever breaks the stillness of the air.\r\n\r\nI have to believe that the valleys and mountains of my native\r\nCatskills were carved out of a great elevated plain or plateau;\r\nthere is no other explanation of them. Here lie the level strata,\r\nwithout any bending or folding, or sign of convulsion and upheavals,\r\nhorizontal as the surface of the sea or lake in which their\r\nsediments were originally laid down; and here are these deep, wide\r\nvalleys cut down through these many sheets of stratified rock; and\r\nhere are these long, high, broad-backed mountains, made up of the\r\nrock that the forces of air and water have left, and with no forces\r\nof erosion at work that would appreciably alter a line of the\r\nlandscape in ten thousand years; and yet we know, if we know\r\nanything about the physical history of the earth, that erosion has\r\ndone this work, carved out these mountains and valleys, from the\r\nDevonian strata, as literally as the sculptor carves his statue from\r\nthe block of marble.\r\n\r\nAbove my lodge on the home farm the vast layers of the gray,\r\nthin-sheeted Catskill rock crop out and look across the valley to\r\ntheir fellows two or more miles away where they crop out in a\r\nsimilar manner on the opposite slope of the mountain. With the eye\r\nof faith I see the great sheets restored, and follow them across on\r\nthe line which they made aeons ago, till they are joined again to\r\ntheir fellows as they were before the agents of erosion had so\r\nwidely severed them.\r\n\r\nThese physical forces have worked as slowly and silently in\r\nsculpturing the landscapes as the biological laws have worked in\r\nevolving man from the lower animals, or the vertebrates from the\r\ninvertebrates. The rains, the dews, the snows, the winds--how could\r\nthese soft, gently careering agents have demolished these rocks and\r\ndug these valleys? One would almost as soon expect the wings and\r\nfeet of the birds to wear away the forests they flit through. The\r\nwings of time are feathered also, and as they brush against the\r\ngranite or the flinty sandstone no visible particle is removed while\r\nyou watch and wait. Come back in a thousand years, and you note no\r\nchange, save in the covering of trees and verdure. Return in ten\r\nthousand, and you would probably find the hills carrying their heads\r\nas high and as proudly as ever. Here and there the face of the cliff\r\nmay have given way, or a talus slid into the valley, or a stream or\r\nriver changed its course, or sawed deeper into the rock, and a lake\r\nbeen turned into a marsh, or the delta of a river broadened--minor\r\nchanges, such as a shingle from your roof or a brick from your\r\nchimney, while your house stands as before. In one hundred thousand\r\nyears what changes should we probably find? Here in the Catskills,\r\nwhere I write, the weathering of the hills and mountains would\r\nprobably have been but slight. It must be fifty thousand years or\r\nmore since the great ice-sheet left us. Where protected by a thin\r\ncoat of soil, its scratches and grooves upon the surface rock are\r\nabout as fresh and distinct as you may see them made in Alaska at\r\nthe present time. Where the rock is exposed, they have weathered\r\nout, one eighth of an inch probably having been worn away. The\r\ndrifting of the withered leaves of autumn, or of the snows of winter\r\nover them, it really seems, would have done as much in that stretch\r\nof time. Then try to fancy the eternity it has taken the subaerial\r\nelements to cut thousands of feet through this hard Catskill\r\nsandstone! No, the evolution of the landscape, the evolution of the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms, the evolution of the suns and\r\nplanets, involve a process so slow, and on such a scale, that it is\r\nquite unthinkable. How long it took evolution to bridge the chasm\r\nbetween the vertebrate and the invertebrate, between the fish and\r\nthe frog, between the frog and the reptile, between the reptile and\r\nthe mammal, or between the lowest mammal and the highest, who can\r\nguess?\r\n\r\nBut the gulf has been passed, and here we are in this teeming world\r\nof life and beauty, with a terrible past behind us, but a brighter\r\nand brighter future before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\"THE WORM STRIVING TO BE MAN\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen our minds have expanded sufficiently to take in and accept the\r\ntheory of evolution, with what different feelings we look upon the\r\nvisible universe from those with which our fathers looked upon it!\r\nEvolution makes the universe alive. In its light we see that\r\nmysterious potency of matter itself, that something in the clod\r\nunder foot that justifies Emerson's audacious line of the \"worm\r\nstriving to be man.\" We are no longer the adopted children of the\r\nearth, but her own real offspring. Evolution puts astronomy and\r\ngeology in our blood and authenticates us and gives us the backing\r\nof the whole solar system. This is the redemption of the earth: it\r\nis the spiritualization of matter.\r\n\r\nIn imagination stand off in vacant space and see the earth rolling\r\nby you, a huge bubble with all its continents and seas and changing\r\nseasons and countless forms of life upon it, and remember that you\r\nare looking upon a great cosmic organism, pulsing with the vital\r\ncurrents of the universe, and that what it holds of living forms\r\nwere not arbitrarily imposed upon it from without, but vitally\r\nevolved from within and that man himself is one of its products as\r\nliterally as are the trees that stand rooted to the soil. Revert to\r\nthe time when life was not, when the globe was a half-incandescent\r\nball, or when it was a seething, weltering waste of heated water,\r\nbefore the land had yet emerged from the waves, and yet you and I\r\nwere there in the latent potencies of the chemically and dynamically\r\nwarring elements. We were there, the same as the heat and flame are\r\nin the coal and wood and as the explosive force of powder is in the\r\ngrains. The creative cosmic chemistry in due time brought us forth,\r\nand started us on the long road that led from the amoeba up to man.\r\nThere have been no days of creation. Creation has been a continuous\r\nprocess, and the creator has been this principle of evolution\r\ninherent in all matter.\r\n\r\nMan himself was born of this principle. His genealogy finally runs\r\nback to the clod under his feet. One has no trouble in accepting the\r\nold Biblical account of his origin from the dust of the earth when\r\none views that dust in the light of modern science.\r\n\r\nMan is undoubtedly of animal origin. He is embraced in the same\r\nzoological scheme as are all other creatures, and did not start as\r\nman any more than you and I started with our present stature, or\r\nthan the earth sprang from chaos as we now behold it.\r\n\r\nHis complete physical evolution must have been achieved thousands of\r\ncenturies ago, but his full mental and spiritual evolution is not\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nI think of his physical evolution as completed when he assumed the\r\nupright attitude or passed from a quadruped to a biped, which must\r\nof itself have been a long, slow process. Probably our whole\r\nhistoric period would form but a fraction of this cycle of\r\nunrecorded time. Man's complete emergence from the lower orders, so\r\nthat he stood off in sharp contrast to them in his physical form\r\nprobably occurred in later Tertiary times, and what the meaning of\r\nthis stretch of time is in human years we can only conjecture.\r\nDuring this cycle of numberless millenniums till the dawn of\r\nhistory, man's development was mainly mental. He left the brute\r\ncreature behind because his mind continued to develop after his\r\nphysical form was complete, while the brute stood still. Whence the\r\nimpulse that sent man forward? Why was one animal form endowed with\r\nthe capacity for endless growth and development, and all the others\r\ndenied it? Ah! that is the question of questions. Compared with the\r\ndevelopment of his bodily powers, man's mental and spiritual growth\r\nhas been very rapid. He seems to have been millions of years in\r\ngetting his body, while he has been only millenniums in getting his\r\nreason and intelligence. What progress since the dawn of history!\r\nCompare the Germans of the time of Tacitus, or the Gauls of the time\r\nof Caesar, or the Britons of the time of Hadrian with the people of\r\nthose countries to-day.\r\n\r\nWe are prone to speak of man's emergence from the lower orders as if\r\nit were a simple thing, almost like the going from one country into\r\nanother. But try to think what it means; try to think of the slow\r\ntransformation, of the long, toilsome road even from the halfway\r\nhouse of our simian ancestors. If we do not give him the benefit of\r\nthe sudden mutation theory of the origin of species, then think of\r\nthe slow process, hair by hair, as it were, by which a tailed,\r\napelike arboreal animal was transformed into a hairless, tailless,\r\nerect, tool-using, fire-using, speech-forming animal. We see in our\r\nown day in the case of the African negro, that centuries of our\r\nNorthern climate have hardly any appreciable effect toward making a\r\nwhite man of him; nor, on the other hand, has exposure to the\r\ntropical sun had much more effect in making a negro of the white\r\nman. Probably it would take ten thousand years or more of these\r\nconditions to bleach the pigments out of the one skin and put them\r\nin the other. There is convincing proof from painting and figures\r\nfound in Egypt that neither the African negro nor the Egyptian has\r\nchanged in features in five thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe most marvelous thing about man's evolution is the inborn upward\r\nimpulse in some one low organism that rested not till it reached its\r\ngoal in him. The mollusk remains, but some impulse went out from the\r\nmollusk that begat the fish. The fish remains, but some impulse went\r\nout from the fish that begat the amphibian. The amphibian remains,\r\nbut some impulse went out from the amphibian that begat the reptile.\r\nThe reptile remains, but some impulse went out from the reptile that\r\nbegat the mammal; and so on up to man. Man must have had a specific\r\nline of descent. One golden thread must connect him with the lowest\r\nforms of life. And the wonder is that this golden thread was never\r\nsnapped or lost through all the terrible vicissitudes of the\r\ngeologic ages. But I suppose it is just as great a wonder that the\r\nline of descent of the horse, or the sheep, or the dog, or the bird,\r\nwas not snapped or lost. Some impulse or tendency was latent or\r\npotential in the first unicellular life that rested not till it\r\neventuated in each of these higher forms. Did any terrestrial or\r\ncelestial calamity endanger the line of descent of any of the higher\r\ncreatures? Was any form cut off in the world-wide crustal\r\ndisturbances of the earth at the end of palaeozoic and mesozoic\r\ntime, when so many forms of animal life appear to have been wiped\r\nout, that might in time have given birth to a kind unlike or\r\nsuperior to any now upon the earth? Species after species have\r\nbecome extinct, whole orders and families have gone out, often\r\nrather suddenly. Why we know not. Why the line of man's descent was\r\nnot cut off, who knows? It is a vain speculation. There can be\r\nlittle doubt that in early Tertiary times our ancestor was a small,\r\nfeeble mammal, maybe of the lemur, maybe of the marsupial kind,\r\npowerless before the great carnivorous mammals of that time, and\r\nprobably escaping them by his greater agility, perhaps by his\r\narboreal habits. The ancestor of the horse was also a small creature\r\nat that time, not larger than a fox. It was not cut off; the line of\r\ndescent seems complete to the horse of our day. Small beginnings\r\nseem to be the rule in all provinces of life. There is little doubt\r\nthat the great animals of our day--the elephant, the whale, the\r\nlion,--all had their start in small forms. Many of these small forms\r\nhave been found. But a complete series of any of the animal forms\r\nthat eventuated in any of the dominant species is yet wanting. It is\r\nquite certain that the huge, the gigantic, the monstrous in animal,\r\nas in vegetable life, lies far behind us. Is it not quite certain\r\nthat evolution in the life of the globe has run its course, and that\r\nit will not again bring forth reptiles or mammals of the terrible\r\nproportions of those of past geologic ages? nor ferns, nor mosses,\r\nnor as gigantic trees as those of Carboniferous times? Probably the\r\nredwoods of the Far West, the gigantic sequoias, are the last race\r\nof gigantic trees. The tide of life of the globe is undoubtedly at\r\nthe full. The flood has no doubt been checked many times. The\r\nglacial periods, of which there seem to have been several in\r\ndifferent parts of the earth, and in different geological periods,\r\nno doubt checked it when it occurred. But the tide as a whole must\r\nhave steadily risen, because the progression from lower to higher\r\nforms has gone steadily forward. The lower forms have come along;\r\nNature has left nothing behind. The radiates, the articulates, the\r\nmollusca, are still with us, but in the midst of these the higher\r\nand higher forms have been constantly appearing. The great\r\nbiological tree has got its growth. Many branches and twigs have\r\ndied and dropped off, and many more will do so, are doing so before\r\nour eyes, but I cannot help doubting that any new branches of\r\nimportance are yet to appear--any new families or orders of birds,\r\nor fishes, or reptiles, or mammals. The horse, the stag, the sheep,\r\nthe dog, the cat, as we know them, are doubtless the end of the\r\nseries. One arrives at this conclusion upon general principles. Life\r\nas a whole must run its course or reach its high-water mark, the\r\nsame as life in its particular phases. Man has arrived and has\r\nuniversal dominion; all things are put under his feet. The destiny\r\nof life upon the globe is henceforth largely in his hands. Not even\r\nhe can avert the final cosmic catastrophe which physicists foresee,\r\nand which, according to Professor Lowell, the beings upon Mars are\r\nnow struggling to ward off.\r\n\r\nMan has taken his chances in the clash of forces of the physical\r\nuniverse. No favor has been shown him, or is shown him to-day, and\r\nyet he has come to his estate. He has never been coddled; fire,\r\nwater, frost, gravity, hunger, death, have made and still make no\r\nexceptions in his favor. He is on a level with all other animals in\r\nthis respect. He has his life and well-being on the same terms as do\r\nthe fowls of the air and the beasts of the fields.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Whately thought that primitive man could never have\r\nraised himself to a higher condition without external aid--some\r\n\"elementary instruction to enable his faculties to begin their\r\nwork.\" He must have had a boost. Well, the boost was forthcoming,\r\nbut it was not from without, but from within, through this principle\r\nof development, this upward striving that was innate from the first\r\nin certain forms of life and of which Whately had no conception. It\r\nwas the conception of his time that creation was like a watch made\r\nand wound up by some power external to itself.\r\n\r\nThe physical evolution of man, as I have said, is no doubt complete.\r\nHe will never have wings, or more legs, or longer arms, or a bigger\r\nbrain. The wings and the extra legs and the keener sense he has left\r\nbehind him. His development henceforth must be in the mental and\r\nspiritual. He is bound to have more and more dominion over Nature,\r\nand see more and more clearly his own relation to her. He will in\r\ntime completely subdue and possess the earth. Yes, and probably\r\nexhaust her? But he will see in time that he is squandering his\r\ninheritance and will mend his ways. He will conserve in the future\r\nas he has wasted in the past. He will learn to conserve his own\r\nhealth. He will banish disease; he will stamp out all the plagues\r\nand scourges, through his scientific knowledge; he will double or\r\ntreble the length of life. Man has undoubtedly passed through and\r\nfinished certain phases of his emotional and mental development. He\r\nwill never again be the religious enthusiast and fanatic he has been\r\nin the past; he has not worshiped his last, but he has worshiped his\r\nbest. He will build no more cathedrals; he will burn no more martyrs\r\nat the stake. His religion as such is on the wane. But his\r\nhumanitarianism is a rising tide. He is becoming less and less a\r\nsavage, revolts more and more at the sight of blood and suffering.\r\nThe highly religious ages were ages of blood and persecution. Man's\r\ntenderness for man has vastly increased. The sense of the sacredness\r\nof human life has increased as his faith in his gods has declined.\r\nHe has grown more human as he has grown less superstitious. Science\r\nhas atrophied his faith, but it has softened his heart. His fear of\r\nNature has given place to love. Man never loved as he does now. He\r\nhas withdrawn his gaze from heaven and fixed it upon the earth. As\r\nhis interest in other worlds has diminished, his interest in this\r\nhas increased. As the angels have departed, the children have come\r\nin.\r\n\r\nWhen the nations, too, cease to be savage and selfish, and become\r\naltruistic, then the new birth of humanity will actually have\r\noccurred. As an artist and a creator of beautiful forms, man has\r\nalso had his day; he loved the beautiful, the artistic, or the\r\nornamental long before he loved the true and the just. He was proud\r\nbefore he was kind; he was chivalrous before he was decent; he was\r\ntattooed before he was washed; he was painted before he was clothed;\r\nhe built temples before he built a home; he sacrificed to his gods\r\nbefore he helped his neighbor; he was heroic before he was\r\nself-denying; he was devout before he was charitable. We are losing\r\nthe savage virtues and vanities and growing in the grace of all the\r\nhumanities, and this process will doubtless go on, with many\r\ninterruptions and setbacks of course, till the kingdom of love is at\r\nlast fairly established upon the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE PHANTOMS BEHIND US\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI take the title of this paper from those great lines in Whitman\r\nbeginning--\r\n\r\n\"Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me\"--\r\n\r\nin which he launches in vivid imaginative form the whole doctrine of\r\nevolution some years before Darwin had published his epoch-making\r\nwork on the \"Origin of Species.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see afar down the huge first Nothing, and I know I was even\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know that Whitman had any concrete belief in the truth of\r\nthe animal origin of man. He read as picture and parable that which\r\nthe man of science reads as demonstrable fact. He saw and felt the\r\ngreat truth of evolution, but he saw it as written in his own heart\r\nand not in the great stone book of the earth, and he saw it written\r\nlarge. He felt its cosmic truth, its truth in relation to the whole\r\nscheme of things; he felt his own kinship with all that lives, and\r\nhad a vivid personal sense of his debt to the past, not only of\r\nhuman history, but also to the past of the earth and the spheres.\r\nAnd he felt this as a poet and not as a man of science.\r\n\r\nThe theory of evolution as applied to the whole universe and its\r\ninevitable corollary, the animal origin of man, is now well\r\nestablished in most of the leading minds of the world, but it is\r\nstill rejected by many timid and sensitive souls, and it will be a\r\nlong time before it becomes universally accepted.\r\n\r\nDoubtless one source of the trouble we have in accepting the theory\r\ncomes from the fact that our minds have not been used to such\r\nthoughts; in the mind of the race they are a new thing: they are not\r\nin the literature nor in the philosophy nor in the sacred books in\r\nwhich our minds have been nurtured; they are of yesterday; they came\r\nto us raw and unhallowed by the usage of ages; more than that, they\r\nsavor of the materialism of all modern science, which is so\r\ndistasteful to our finer ideals and religious sensibilities. In\r\nfact, these ideas are strangers of an alien race in our intellectual\r\nhousehold, and we look upon them coldly and distrustfully. But\r\nprobably to our children, or to our children's children, they will\r\nwear quite a different countenance; they will have become an\r\naccepted part of the great family of ideas of the race.\r\n\r\nAnother hindrance is the dullness and opacity of our own minds. We\r\nare slow to wake up to a sense of the divinity that hedges us about.\r\nThe great office of science has been to show us this universe as\r\nmuch more wonderful and divine than we have been wont to believe;\r\nshot through and through with celestial laws and forces; matter,\r\nindeed, but matter informed with spirit and intelligence; the\r\ncreative energy inherent and active in the ground underfoot not less\r\nthan in the stars and nebulae overhead.\r\n\r\nWe look for the divine afar off. We gaze upon the beauty and purity\r\nof the heavenly bodies without thinking that we are also in the\r\nheavens. We must open our minds to the stupendous fact that God is\r\nimmanent in his universe and that it is literally and exactly true,\r\nas we were taught long ago, that, during every moment of our lives,\r\nin Him we live and move and have our being.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we are staggered by the element of vast time that is\r\nimplied in the history of development. Were it not for the records\r\nin the rocks, we could not believe it at all. All the grand\r\nmovements and processes of nature are quite beyond our ken. In the\r\nheavens only the astronomer with his prisms and telescopes traces\r\nthem; only the geologist and palaeontologist read their history in\r\nthe earth's crust. The soil we cultivate was once solid rock, but\r\nnot in one lifetime, not in many lifetimes, do we see the\r\ntransformation of the rocks into soil. Nations may rise and fall,\r\nand the rocks they looked upon and the soil they tilled remain\r\npractically unchanged. Geologists talk about the ancient continents\r\nthat have passed away. What an abyss of time such things open! They\r\ntalk about the birth of a mountain or the decay of a mountain as we\r\ntalk of the birth and death of a man, but in doing so they reckon\r\nwith periods of time for which we have no standards of measurement.\r\nThey walk and talk with the Eternal. To us the mountains seem as\r\nfixed as the stars. But the stars, too, are flitting. Look at Orion\r\nsome millions of years hence, and he will have been torn limb from\r\nlimb. The combination of stars that forms that striking\r\nconstellation and all other constellations is temporary as the\r\ngrouping of the clouds. The rise of man from the lower orders\r\nimplies a scale of time almost as great. It is unintelligible to us\r\nbecause it belongs to a category of facts that transcends our\r\nexperience and the experience of the race as the interstellar spaces\r\ntranscend our earthly measurements.\r\n\r\nWe now gaze upon the order below us across an impassable gulf, but\r\nthat gulf we have crossed and without any supernatural means of\r\ntransportation. We may say it has been bridged or filled with the\r\nhumble ancestral forms that carried forward the precious\r\nevolutionary impulse of the vertebrate series till it culminated in\r\nman. All vestiges of that living bridge are now gone, and the legend\r\nof our crossing seems like a dream or a miracle. Biological\r\nevolution has gone hand in hand with geological evolution, and both\r\nare on a scale of time of which our hour-glass of the centuries\r\ngives us but a faint hint. Our notions of time are not formed on the\r\npattern of the cosmic processes, or the geologic processes, or the\r\nevolutionary processes; they are formed on the pattern of our own\r\nbrief span of life. In a few cases in the familiar life about us we\r\nsee the evolutionary process abridged, and transformations like\r\nthose of unrecorded time take place before our eyes, as when the\r\ntadpole becomes the frog or the grub becomes the butterfly. These\r\nrapid changes are analogous to those which in the depths of geologic\r\ntime have evolved the bird from the fish or the reptile, or the seal\r\nand the manatee from a fourfooted land animal. Our common bluebird\r\nhas long been recognized as a descendant of the thrush family; this\r\norigin is evident in the speckled breast of the young birds and in\r\nthe voices of the mature birds. I have heard a bluebird with an\r\nunmistakable thrush note. The transformation has doubtless been so\r\nslow that an analogous change taking place in any of the bird forms\r\nof our own time would entirely escape observation. The bluebird may\r\nhave been as long in getting his blue coat as man has been in\r\ngetting his upright position.\r\n\r\nLooking into the laws and processes of the common nature about us\r\nfor clues to the origin of man is not unlike looking into the\r\nrecords of the phonograph for the secret of the music which that\r\nwonderful instrument voices for us. Something, some active principle\r\nor agent, has to invoke the music that slumbers or is latent in\r\nthese lines.\r\n\r\nIn like manner some principle or force that we do not see is active\r\nin the ground underfoot and in the forms of life about us which is\r\nthe final secret of the origin of man and of all other creatures.\r\nThis something is the evolutionary impulse, this innate aspiration\r\nof living matter to reach higher and higher forms. \"Urge and urge,\"\r\nsays Whitman, \"always the procreant urge of the world.\" It is in\r\nEmerson's worm \"striving to be man.\" This \"striving\" pervades\r\norganic nature. Whence its origin science does not assume to say.\r\n[Footnote: This passage was written long before I had read Bergson's\r\nCreative Evolution, as were several others of the same import in\r\nthis volume.]\r\n\r\nThen the difference in kind between the mind of man and that of the\r\nlower orders makes evolution a doubly hard problem.\r\n\r\nLook over the globe and see what a gulf separates man from all other\r\ncreatures. All the other animals seem akin--as if the product of the\r\nsame workman. Man, in contrast, seems like an introduction from some\r\nother sphere or the outcome of quite other psychological laws; his\r\ndominion over them all is so complete and universal. Without their\r\nspecialization of structure or powers, he yet masters them all and\r\nuses them; without their powers of speed, he yet outstrips them;\r\nwithout their strength of tusk and limb, he yet subdues them;\r\nwithout their inerrant instinct, he yet outwits them; without their\r\nkeenness of eye, ear, and nose, he yet wins in the chase; without\r\ntheir special adaptation to environment, he survives when they\r\nperish. A man is marked off from the animals below him, I say, as if\r\nhe were a being of another sphere. He looks into their eyes and they\r\ninto his, and no recognition passes; and yet we have to believe that\r\nhe and they are fruit of the same biologic tree and that their stem\r\nforms unite in the same trunk somewhere in the abyss of biologic\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe rise of man from the lower orders taxes our powers of belief and\r\nour faith in the divinity that lurks underfoot far more than did the\r\nspecial creation myth. Creation by omnipotent fiat seems easy when\r\nyou have the omnipotent being to begin with, but creation through\r\nevolution is a kind of cosmic or biologic legerdemain that baffles\r\nand bewilders us. It so far transcends all our earthly knowledge and\r\nexperience and all the flights of our philosophy that we stand\r\nspeechless before it. It opens a gulf that the imagination cannot\r\nclear; it opens vistas from which we instinctively shrink; it opens\r\nup abysms of time in which our whole historic period would be but a\r\nday; it opens up a world of struggle, delay, waste, failure that\r\npalls the imagination. It challenges our faith in the immanency and\r\nin the ceaseless activity of God in his world; it brings the\r\ncreative energy down from its celestial abode and clothes it with\r\nthe flesh and blood of animal life. It may chill and shock us; it\r\nshows us that we are of the earth earthy; yea, that we are of the\r\nanimal beastly; it presses us down in matter; it puts out the lights\r\nto which we have so long turned as lighting our origin; the words\r\n\"sacred,\" \"divine,\" \"holy,\" and \"celestial,\" as applied to our\r\norigin and development, we have no longer any use for, nor for any\r\nwords or ideas that set us apart from the rest of creation--above it\r\nin our origin or apart from it in our relations. The atmosphere of\r\nmystery and miracle and sanctity that our religious training has\r\nthrown around our introduction upon this planet and around our\r\nrelations and destiny science dispels. Our language and many of our\r\nideas and habits of thought date back to pre-scientific times--when\r\nthere were two worlds, the heavenly and the earthly, separated by a\r\ngulf. Now we know that the two worlds are one, that they are\r\ninseparably blended; that the celestial and the terrestrial are\r\nunder the same law; that we can never be any more in the heavens\r\nthan we are here and now, nor any nearer the final sources of life\r\nand power; that the divine is underfoot as well as overhead; that we\r\nare part and parcel of the physical universe, and take our chances\r\nin the cosmic processes the same as the rest, and draw upon the same\r\nfund of animal life that the other creatures do. We are identified\r\nwith the worm underfoot no less than with the stars overhead. We are\r\nnot degraded by such a thought, but the whole of creation is lifted\r\nup. Our minds and bodies are not less divine, but all things are\r\nmore divine. We have to gird up our loins and try to summon strength\r\nto see this tremendous universe as it is, alive and divine to the\r\nlast particle and embosomed in the Infinite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolution is not the final explanation of the universe, but it is\r\nprobably the largest generalization of the modern mind. Science has\r\nto start somewhere, and it starts with the universe as it finds it\r\nand seeks to trace secondary or proximate causes; the evolutionist\r\nseeks to trace the footsteps of creative energy in the world of\r\nanimal life. How did God make man? Out of the dust of the earth,\r\nsays the Bible of our fathers. The evolutionist teaches essentially\r\nthe same thing, only he does not abridge the process as the\r\ncatechism has abridged it for us; he would fain unfold the whole\r\nlong road that man has traveled from the first protozoic cell to the\r\nvast communities of cells that now make up his physical life. He\r\nwould show how man has risen on stepping-stones of his dead self.\r\nThese stepping-stones have been the animal forms below him. In them\r\nand through them something, some impulse, some force, has mounted\r\nand mounted through all the enormous lapse of geologic time. In\r\nimagination we see the dim, shadowy man, restless and struggling in\r\na vast number of earlier forms. He has struggled upward through the\r\ninvertebrates, through the fish, through the reptile, through the\r\nlower mammals, through his simian ancestors till he reaches his goal\r\nin the man we know.\r\n\r\nDarwin was not the author of the theory of evolution, but he made\r\nthe theory alive and real to the imagination. He showed us what a\r\nmaster key it is for unlocking the riddle of the life of the globe.\r\nHe launched biological science upon a new career and made it worthy\r\nof its place in the great trilogy of sciences, astronomy, geology,\r\nand biology, of which Tennyson, in his poem \"Parnassus,\" recognized\r\nonly the first two. Had Tennyson written his poem in our day he\r\nwould undoubtedly have included biology among his \"terrible Muses\"\r\nthat tower above all others, eclipsing the glory of the great poets.\r\nOr is it true that we find it easier to accept the theory of the\r\nevolution of the worlds and suns from nebulous matter than to accept\r\nthe theory of the evolution of man from the maze of the lower animal\r\nforms? It is less personal to us. The astronomer has the advantage\r\nof the biologist in one important respect: he can show us in the\r\nheavens now the process of the evolution of worlds actually going\r\non, but the biologist cannot show us the transformation of one\r\nspecies into another taking place to-day. We can sound the abysses\r\nof astronomic space easier than we can sound the abysses of geologic\r\ntime. The stars and the nebulae we have always with us, but where\r\nare the myriad earlier forms that were the antecedents of the\r\npresent animal life of the globe? True, the palaeontologist finds a\r\nmore or less disjointed record of them in the stratified rocks and\r\nsees in a measure the course evolution has taken, but he does not\r\nactually see it at work as does the astronomer. More than that, the\r\nforces the astronomer deals with are mechanical and chemical, but\r\nthe biologist deals with a new force called life that often reverses\r\nor defies mechanical and chemical forces, but which is yet so\r\nidentified and blended with them that we cannot conceive it apart\r\nfrom them. The stomach does not digest itself, nor gravity hold the\r\nblood in the lower extremities. The tree lifts up its weight of\r\nfluids and solids and holds aloft its fruit and foliage in spite of\r\ngravity; its growing roots split and lift the rocks; mosses and\r\nlichens disintegrate granite; vital energy triumphs over chemical\r\nand mechanical energy.\r\n\r\nBiological laws are much more subtle and difficult to trace and\r\nformulate than chemical and mechanical laws. Hence the student of\r\norganic evolution can rarely arrive at the demonstrable certainties\r\nin this field that he can in the sphere of chemistry and mechanics.\r\nIt is very doubtful if life can ever be explained in terms of these\r\nthings. Life works through chemical combinations and affinities, and\r\nyet is it not more than chemistry? It works with and through\r\nmechanical principles and forces, and yet it is evidently more than\r\nmechanics. It is manifested through matter, and yet no analysis of\r\nmatter can reveal its secret. It comes and goes while matter stays;\r\nwe destroy life, but cannot destroy matter. It is as fugitive as the\r\nwind which fills all sails one minute and is gone the next. It\r\navails itself of fluids and gases and the laws which govern them,\r\nbut fluids and gases do not explain it. It waits upon the rains and\r\nthe dews, but it is more than they are; it follows in the footsteps\r\nof the decay and disintegration of the inorganic, and yet it is not\r\nthe gift of these things; it transforms the face of the earth, and\r\nyet the earth has been and will be when it was not and when it will\r\nnot be. Through his knowledge and his science man performs wonders\r\nevery day; he can reduce mountains to powder and seas to dry land,\r\nbut he cannot create or start de novo the least throb of life. At\r\nleast, he has not yet done so. With all his vast resources of\r\nmechanics and chemistry, and his insight into the mechanism of the\r\nuniverse, he has not yet made the least particle of inorganic matter\r\nthrill with the mysterious something we call life.\r\n\r\nThere must have been a time when life was not upon the earth and\r\nthere must again come a time when it will not be. It has probably\r\nvanished from the moon and all inferior planets, and it has not yet\r\ncome to the superior planets, except maybe to Mars. It must be and\r\nmust have always been potential in matter, but this fact leaves the\r\nmystery as profound as ever.\r\n\r\nYet if the artificial production of life were to happen to-day--if\r\nin some of our laboratories living matter were produced from\r\nnon-living, should we not still have to credit the event to some\r\nmysterious potency residing in matter itself? If by a lucky stroke\r\nman were to evoke the organic from the inorganic, be assured he\r\nwould not evoke something from nothing, or add anything to the\r\nlatent possibilities of the elements with which he works. Does not\r\nthe question still remain who or what made this feat possible? One\r\ndare affirm that man cannot create life de novo any more than he can\r\ncreate matter. He may yet evoke life as he evokes the spark from the\r\nflint and the flame from the match or as he evokes force from the\r\nfood he eats. In this latter case he does not create the force; he\r\nliberates it through the vital forces of his body. The spark from\r\nthe flint and the flame from the match were called forth by a\r\nmechanical process, but the process was set going by the will which\r\nwaits upon the vital process. The body with all its many functions\r\nis a complicated system of mechanical devices and chemical\r\nprocesses, but that which is back of all and governs all is not\r\nmechanical; the body is a machine plus something else.\r\n\r\nThe chemist or biologist who shall produce a speck of protoplasm\r\nto-day will have the credit of unlocking a power in inorganic\r\nnature; he will prove by a short cut how immanent the creative\r\nenergy or the vital force of the universe is in matter. He will not\r\nhave eliminated the creative energy; he will only have disclosed it\r\nand availed himself of it.\r\n\r\nWe behold spontaneous combustion, a fire self-kindled, but we do\r\nnot see the activity of the particles of matter that preceded it or\r\npenetrate the secret of their mysterious affinities. The fire was\r\npotential there in the very constitution of the elements. We flout\r\nat miracles, and then we disclose an unending miracle in the life\r\nabout us.\r\n\r\nAll the life upon the globe, including man with all his marvelous\r\npowers, surely originated upon the globe, surely arose out of the\r\nnon-living and the non-thinking, not by the fiat of some power\r\nexternal to nature, but through the creative energy inherent in\r\nnature and ever active there. The great physical instrumentality was\r\nheat--without heat the reaction called life could never have taken\r\nplace. This fact has led a French biologist to say that life is only\r\na surface accident in the history of the thermic evolution of the\r\nglobe. Without the disintegration of the rocks and the formation of\r\nthe soil and the precipitation of watery vapor, which was indirectly\r\nthe work of heat, the vegetable and the animal could not have\r\ndeveloped. If we succeed in proving that all these things are of\r\nchemico-mechanical origin, we still want to know who or what\r\ninstituted these chemical and mechanical powers and the laws that\r\ngovern them. Creation by chemistry and mechanics is as mysterious as\r\ncreation by miracle. We must still have a creator, while we can do\r\nnothing with him nor find any place for him in an endless,\r\nbeginningless, infinite series of events. So there we are. We go out\r\nof the same door by which we came in.\r\n\r\nWhen all life vanishes from the earth, as it will when the condition\r\nof heat and moisture has radically changed, and eternal\r\nrefrigeration sets in--what then? The potencies of matter will not\r\nhave changed and life will reappear and go through its cycle again\r\non some other sphere.\r\n\r\nLife began upon this earth not by miracle in the old sense, but by\r\nmiracle in the new scientific sense--by the immanence and ceaseless\r\nactivity of the creative energy in the physical world about us--in\r\nthe sunbeam, in the rains, in the snows, in the air currents, and in\r\nthe soil underfoot; in oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, in lime,\r\niron, silex, phosphorus, and in all the rest of them. Each has its\r\nlaws, its ways, its fixed mode of procedure, its affinities, its\r\nlikes and dislikes, and life is bound up with all of them. If we\r\nhypothesize the ether to explain certain phenomena, why should we\r\nnot hypothesize a vital force to account for other mysteries?\r\n\r\nThe inorganic passes into the organic as night passes into day.\r\nWhere does one end and the other begin? No man can tell. There is no\r\nbeginning and no ending of either, and yet night comes and goes and\r\nday comes and goes--a constant becoming and a constant ending. We\r\nare probably in the midday of the life of the globe--life huge and\r\nrank and riotous--the youth of life has passed, life more sedate and\r\naspiring and spiritual has come. The gigantic has gone or is going,\r\nthe huge monsters of the sea and of the land have had their day, man\r\nappears at the end of the series of lesser but more complete forms.\r\n\r\nMany intelligent persons who have been rocked in the cradle of the\r\nold creeds still look upon evolution as a godless doctrine and\r\naccuse it of vulgarizing high and sacred things. This state of mind\r\ncan only be slowly outgrown by familiarizing ourselves with the\r\nprocesses of nature or of the creative energy in the world of life\r\nand matter about us; with our own origin in the low fishlike or\r\napelike creature in the maternal womb; with the development of every\r\nplant, tree, and animal from a microscopic germ; with the unbroken\r\nsequence of natural law; with the waste, the delays, the pains, the\r\nfailures on every hand; with the impersonal and the impartial\r\ncharacter of all the physical forces; with the transformations and\r\nmetamorphoses that marked the course of animal life; and, above all,\r\nwith the thought that evolution is not self-caused or in any true\r\nsense a cause in itself, but the instrument or plan of the power\r\nthat works in and through all things. The ways of God in all these\r\ndetails are past finding out, but science watches the unfolding of a\r\nbud, the development of a grain of wheat, the growth of the human\r\nembryo, the succession of life-forms upon the globe as revealed in\r\nthe records of the stratified rocks, or observes in the heavens the\r\ncondensation of nebulous matter into suns and systems, and it says\r\nthis is one of his ways. Evolution--an endless unfolding and\r\ntransformation. \"Urge and urge and urge,\" says Whitman (I love to\r\nrepeat this saying; it is so significant), \"always the procreant\r\nurge of the world.\" Always the labor and travail pains of the\r\nuniverse to bring forth higher forms; always struggle and pain and\r\nfailure and death, but always a new birth and an upward reach.\r\n\r\nStrike out the element of time and we see evolution as the great\r\nprestidigitator of the biologic ages. The creative energy\r\nmanipulates a fish and it turns into a reptile; it covers a mollusk\r\nas with a vapor and behold, a backboned creature instead! Now we see\r\na little creature no larger than a fox and when we look again,\r\nbehold the horse; a wolf or some kindred animal is plunged into the\r\nwater, and behold, the seal! Some small creature of the lemur kind\r\nis covered with a capacious hand, and we look again, and behold man!\r\nWe have only to minimize time and minimize space to see the\r\nimpossible happening all about us or to see the Mosaic account of\r\ncreation repeated; we have only the clay and water to begin with,\r\nwhen, presto! behold what we have now! We see the rocks covered with\r\nverdure, the mountains vanishing into plains, the valleys changing\r\ninto hills or the plains changing into mountains, tropic lands\r\ncovered with ice and snow.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury thought he had discredited natural selection, which\r\nis one of the feet upon which evolution goes, when he charged that\r\nno one had ever seen it at work. We have not seen it at work because\r\nour little span of life is too short. Only the palaeontologist\r\ntraces in the records of the rocks the footsteps of this god of\r\nchange. And rarely if ever does he find a continuous and complete\r\nrecord--only a footprint here and there, but he sees the direction\r\nin which they are going and many of the places where the traveler\r\ntarried. The palaeontologist, that detective of the rocks, works up\r\nhis case with the same thoroughness and caution and the same power\r\nof observation as does the detective in human affairs and with a\r\ngreater sweep of scientific imagination.\r\n\r\nAn agent of evolution is the influence of the environment, but who\r\nsees the environment set its stamp upon animal life? After many\r\ngenerations we may see the accumulated results. In a few instances\r\nthe results are rapid. Thus sheep lose their wool in tropical\r\nclimates and a northern fur-bearing animal its fur. The well-being\r\nof the animal demands this change, and demands it quickly. Fish lose\r\ntheir sense of sight in underground streams; this loss is not so\r\nvital and it comes about much more slowly. A tropical climate sets\r\nits stamp upon the complexion and character of man, but this again\r\nis a slow process, as the same stress of necessity does not exist.\r\n\r\nIn the tendency to variation--in form, size, disposition, power,\r\nfertility--man differs from all other animals. In the same race, in\r\nthe same family, we find infinitely varied types. Among the wild\r\ncreatures all the individuals of a species are practically alike. We\r\ncan hardly tell one fox, or one marmot, or one chipmunk, or one\r\ncrow, or one hawk, or one black duck from another of the same\r\nspecies. Of course there are slight individual differences, but they\r\nare hardly distinguishable. Among the insects, one bee, one beetle,\r\none ant, one butterfly seems the exact copy of every other\r\nindividual of its kind. The law of variation seems practically\r\nannulled in the insect world.\r\n\r\nIt is the wide and free range of this law in the human species that\r\nhas undoubtedly led to the great progress of the race. There has\r\nbeen no dead level--no democracy of talent--no equality of gifts,\r\nbut only equality of opportunity. Men differ from one another in\r\ntheir mental endowments, capacities, and dispositions vastly more\r\nthan do any other creatures upon the earth. This difference makes\r\nman's chances of progress so much the greater; he has so many more\r\nstakes in the game. If one type of talent fails, another type may\r\nwin; if the lymphatic temperament is not a success, try the sanguine\r\nor the bilious; blue eyes and black eyes and brown eyes will win\r\nmore triumphs than blue or black or brown alone. Arms or legs extra\r\nlong, sight or hearing extra sharp, wit extra keen, judgment extra\r\nsure--all these things open doors to more progress. Variation gives\r\nnatural selection a chance to take hold, and where the struggle for\r\nlife is the most severe the changes will be the most rapid and the\r\nmost radical. Without the pressure of the environment natural\r\nselection would not select. The tendency to physical variation in\r\nman is probably no greater than in other creatures, but his tendency\r\nto mental variation is enormous. He varies daily from mediocrity to\r\ngenius, hence the enormous range of his chances of progress. From\r\nthe first variation that started him on his way in his line of\r\ndescent, variation must have been more and more active till he\r\nvaried in the direction of reason, long before the dawn of history,\r\nsince which time his progress has been by rapid strides--and more\r\nand more rapid till we see his leaps forward in recent times. The\r\nrace owes its rapid progress to its exceptional men, its men of\r\ngenius and power, and these have often been like sports or the\r\nsudden result of mutations--a man like Lincoln springing from the\r\nhumblest parentage. No such extreme variations are seen in any of\r\nthe lower orders. Indeed, in one's lifetime one sees but very slight\r\nvariation in any of the wild or domestic creatures, less in the wild\r\nthan in the domestic because they are less under the influence of\r\nthat most variable of animals, man. And man's variations are mainly\r\nmental and not physical. The higher we go in the scale of powers,\r\nthe greater the variation and hence the more rapid the evolution.\r\nProbably man's body has not changed radically in vast cycles of\r\ntime, but his mind has developed enormously since the dawn of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiologists are coming more and more to recognize some unknown factor\r\nin evolution, probably some unknowable factor. The four factors of\r\nOsborn--heredity, ontogeny, environment, selection--play upon and\r\nmodify endlessly the new form when it is started, but what about the\r\noriginal start? Whence comes this inborn momentum, this evolutionary\r\nsend-off? What or who set the whole grand process going?\r\n\r\nBergson sees an internal psychological principle of development,\r\nhence the name of his book, \"Creative Evolution.\" Osborn uses the\r\nword \"directed.\" Certain characters, he says, are adaptive or suited\r\nto their purpose from the start; they do not have to be fitted to\r\ntheir place by natural selection. Huxley uses the word\r\n\"predestined\"--all the life of the globe and all the starry hosts of\r\nheaven are working out in boundless space and in endless time \"their\r\npredestined course of evolution.\" Darwin must have had in mind the\r\nsame mysterious something when he said that man had risen to the\r\nvery summit of the animal scale, but not through his own exertions.\r\nNot by his own will or exertion, surely, any more than the embryo in\r\nits mother's womb develops into the full-grown child by its own\r\nexertion or than our temperaments and complexions and statures are\r\nmatters of our own wills and choice. Something greater than man and\r\nbefore him, to which he sustains the relation that the unborn child\r\nsustains to its mother, must enter into our thought of his origin\r\nand development.\r\n\r\nThe great evolutionists have been very cautious about seeking to go\r\nbehind evolution and name the Primal Cause. In such an attempt\r\nscience would at once be beyond soundings. Darwin and Huxley were\r\nreverent, truth-loving men, but they hesitated as men of science to\r\nput themselves in a position where no step could be taken.\r\n\r\nSlowly man emerges out of the abyss of geologic time into the dawn\r\nof history, and science gropes about like a man feeling his way in\r\nthe dark or, at most, by the aid now and then of a dim flash of\r\nlight, to trace the path he has come. He has surely arrived, and we\r\nare, I believe, safe in saying he has come by the way of the lower\r\norders; but the precise forms through which he has come, the houses\r\nin which he has tarried by the way, and all the adventures and\r\nvicissitudes that befell him on the journey--can we ever hope to\r\nknow these things? In any case, man has his antecedents; life has\r\nits antecedents; every beat of one's heart has its antecedent cause,\r\nwhich again has its antecedent. We can thus traverse the chain of\r\ncausation only to find it is an endless chain; the separate links we\r\ncan examine, but the first link or the last we see, by the very\r\nnature of things, and the laws of our own minds, must forever elude\r\nus. Science cannot admit of a break in the chain of causation,\r\ncannot admit that miracles or the supernatural in the old sense, as\r\nexternal and arbitrary interference with the natural order, can play\r\nor ever have played any part in this universe. Yet science has to\r\npostulate a First Cause when it knows, or metaphysics knows for it,\r\nthat with the Infinite there can be no first and no last, no\r\nbeginning and no ending, only endless succession.\r\n\r\nTo science man is not a fallen creature, but a many times risen\r\ncreature and all the good of the universe centres in him. The mind\r\nthat pervades all nature and is active in plant and animal alike\r\nfirst comes to know itself and regard itself and achieve\r\nintellectual appreciation in man. While all nature below man is wise\r\nonly to its own ends and goes its appointed way as void of\r\nself-consciousness as the stone that falls or the wind that blows,\r\nthe mind of man attains to disinterested wisdom and turns upon\r\nitself and upon the universe the power of objective thought; it\r\nalone achieves understanding.\r\n\r\nIn our studies of life and of the universe as soon as we begin to\r\nbridge chasms by an appeal to the miraculous, or to the\r\nextra-natural powers, we are traitors to the scientific spirit which\r\nwe seek to serve. There are many things that science cannot explain.\r\nPerhaps I may say that it cannot give the ultimate explanation of\r\nanything. It can do little more than tell us of the action, the\r\ninteraction, and the reaction of things, but of the things\r\nthemselves, their origin and ultimate nature, or the source of the\r\nlaws that govern them, what does it or what can it know?\r\n\r\nMan is the heir of all the geologic ages; he inherits the earth\r\nafter countless generations of animals and plants, and the\r\nbeneficent forces of wind and rain, air and sky, have in the course\r\nof millions of years prepared it for him. His body has been built\r\nfor him through the lives and struggles of the countless beings who\r\nare in the line of his long descent; his mind is equally an\r\naccumulated inheritance of the mental growth of the myriads of\r\nthinking men and unthinking animals that went before him. In the\r\nforms of his humbler forebears he has himself lived and died myriads\r\nof times to make ready the soil that nurses and sustains him to-day.\r\nHe is a debtor to Cambrian and Silurian times, to the dragons and\r\nsaurians and mastodons that have roamed over the earth. Indeed, what\r\nis there or has there been in the universe that he is not indebted\r\nto? The remotest star that shines has sent a ray that has entered\r\ninto his life. All things are under his feet, and the keys of the\r\nheavens are in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would fain arrive at some concrete belief or image of his line\r\nof descent in geologic time as he does in the historic period. But\r\nhow hard it is to do so! Can we form any mental picture of the\r\nactual animal forms that the manward impulse has traveled through?\r\nWith all the light that palaeontology throws upon the animal life of\r\nthe past, can we see where amid the revel of these bizarre forms our\r\nancestor hid himself? Can we see him as a reptile in the slime of\r\nthe jungle or in the waters of the Mesozoic world? What was he like\r\nor what akin to? What mark or sign was there upon him at that time\r\nof the future that was before him? Can we see him as a fish in the\r\nold Devonian seas or lakes? Was he a big fish or a little fish? The\r\nprimitive fishes were mostly of the shark kind. Is there any\r\nconnection between that fact and the human sharks of to-day? Much\r\nless can one picture to one's self what his ancestor was like in the\r\nage of the invertebrates, amid the trilobites, etc., of the earlier\r\nPalaeozoic seas. But we must go back even earlier than that, back to\r\nunicellular life and to original protoplasm, and finally back to\r\nfiery nebulous matter. What can we make of it all by way of concrete\r\nconception of what actually took place--of the visible, eating,\r\nwarring, breeding animal forms in whose safekeeping our heritage\r\nlay? Nothing. We are not merely at sea, we are in abysmal depths,\r\nand the darkness is so thick we can cut it.\r\n\r\nWe meet the same difficulty when we try to figure to ourselves the\r\nline of descent of any of the animal forms of to-day. How did they\r\nescape the world-wild catastrophe of earlier geologic times? Or\r\ndid the creative impulse bank upon life as a whole and never become\r\nbankrupt, no matter what special lines or forms failed?\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of the primates is in Eocene times and the\r\nanthropoid apes in the Miocene, probably five millions of years ago.\r\nThe form which may have been in our line of descent, the\r\nDryopithecus, later appears to have become extinct. Did our fate\r\nhang upon the success of any of these forms? The monkeys and\r\nanthropoid apes appeared at the same time in different countries.\r\nNature seems to have been making preliminary studies of man in these\r\nvarious forms, but when and where she hit upon the form that she\r\nperfected in man, who knows?\r\n\r\nThe horse appears to have been evolved in North America, true cattle\r\nin Asia, elephants in Africa. Can we narrow their line of descent\r\ndown to a single pair for each? Many forms allied to the horse\r\nappeared in Europe and Asia in Miocene times. We find monkeys in\r\ndifferent parts of the world in the same geologic horizons; did they\r\nall have a common origin?\r\n\r\nLife's apprenticeship has been a long one. The earlier forms of\r\nvertebrate life were very large; later they became very small.\r\nNature seems to have experimented with bulk, as if she thought size\r\nwould win in the race. Hence those huge uncouth forms among the\r\nreptiles and early mammals. The scheme did not work well; bulk was\r\nnot the thing, after all. Most of the gigantic forms became extinct.\r\nThen she tried smaller and more agile forms with larger brains--less\r\nflesh and more wit. On this line Nature continued to work till she\r\nproduced her masterpiece in man--a rather feeble and nearly\r\nweaponless animal, but with an intangible armory of weapons and\r\ntools in his brain that enables him to put all creatures under his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE HAZARDS OF THE PAST\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBergson, the new French philosopher, thinks we all had a narrow\r\nescape, back in geologic time, of having our eggs spoiled before\r\nthey were hatched, or, rather, rendered incapable of hatching by too\r\nthick a shell. This was owing to the voracity of the early\r\norganisms. As they became more and more mobile, they began to take\r\non thick armors and breastplates and shells and calcareous skins to\r\nprotect themselves from one another. This tendency resulted, he\r\nthinks, in the arrest of the entire animal world in its evolution\r\ntoward higher and higher forms. These shells and armors begat a kind\r\nof torpor and immobility which has continued down to our day with\r\nthe echinoderms and mollusks, but the arthropods and vertebrates\r\nescaped it by some lucky stroke. Now you and I are here without\r\nimprisoning shells on our backs; but how or why did we escape?\r\nBergson does not say. Was it a matter of luck or chance? Was there\r\never a time when the stream of life tended to harden and become\r\nfixed in its own forms like a stream of cooling lava, or has the\r\ninnate plasticity of life been easily equal to its own ends? True,\r\nthe clam remains a clam, and the starfish remains a starfish; some\r\nother forms have carried the evolutionary impulse forward till it\r\nflowered in man. Was this impulse ever really checked or endangered?\r\nWas the golden secret ever intrusted to the keeping of any single\r\nform? and, had that form been cut off, would the earth have been\r\nstill without its man? These are puzzling questions.\r\n\r\nThus, when we have come to look upon life and nature in the light of\r\nevolution, what vistas are opened to us where before were only blank\r\nwalls! The geologic ages take on a new interest to us. We know that\r\nin some form we were even there. The systems of sedimentary rocks\r\nwhich the geologist portrays, piled one upon the other to a depth of\r\nfifty miles or more, seem like the stairway by which we have\r\nascended, taking on some new and more developed form at each rise.\r\nWhat we were at the first step in Cambrian times only the Lord\r\nknows, but whatever we were, we crept up or floated up to the next\r\nrise. In the Silurian seas we may have been a trilobite for aught we\r\nknow; at any rate, we were the outcome of the life impulse that\r\nbegat the trilobites, but our fate was not bound up with theirs, as\r\ntheir race came to an end in those early geologic ages, and our stem\r\nform did not. Whether or not we were a fish in the Devonian seas,\r\nthere is little doubt that we had gills, because we have the gill\r\nslits yet in our early foetal life, and it is quite certain that in\r\nsome way we owe our backbones to the fishes.\r\n\r\nWhen the rocks that form my native Catskills were being laid down in\r\nthe Devonian waters, I fancy that my aquatic embryo was swimming\r\nabout somewhere and slowly waxing strong. Up and up I climbed across\r\nthe sandstone steps, across the limestone, the conglomerate, the\r\nslate, up into Carboniferous times. The upper and nether millstones\r\nof the \"millstone grit\" did not crush me, neither did the floods and\r\nthe convulsions of Carboniferous times that buried the vast\r\nvegetable growths that resulted in our coal measures engulf or\r\ndestroy me. About that time probably, I emerged from the water and\r\nbecame an amphibian, and maybe got my five fingers and five toes on\r\neach side.\r\n\r\nNor did the wholesale destruction of animal life at the end of\r\nPalaeozoic time cut off my line of descent. The monstrous reptiles\r\nof the succeeding or Mesozoic age, the petrified remains of one of\r\nwhich was recently found in the sandstone rocks near the river's\r\nedge under the Palisades of the Hudson, do not seem to have\r\nendangered the golden thread by which our fate hung. Still \"I mount\r\nand mount.\" The stairs by which I climb were rent by earthquakes and\r\nvolcanoes, the strata were squeezed up and overturned and folded in\r\nthe great mountain-chains; the Alps, the Andes, the Himalayas, the\r\nCoast Range were born; the earth-throes must have been tremendous at\r\ntimes; yet I escaped it all. The huge and fearful mammals of the\r\nthird or Tertiary period passed me by unharmed. Eruptions and\r\ncataclysms, the sinking of the land, the inundations of the sea,\r\nworld-wide deformations of the earth's crust, fire and ice and\r\nfloods, monsters of the deep and dragons of the land and the air\r\nhave beset my course from the first, and yet here I am, here we all\r\nare, and apparently none the worse for the appalling dangers we have\r\npassed through.\r\n\r\nEvolution thus makes the world over for us. It shows us in what a\r\ncomplex web of vital and far-reaching relations we stand. It gives\r\nus an outlook upon the past that is startling, and in some ways\r\nforbidding, yet one that ought to be stimulating and inspiring. If\r\nwe look back with a shudder we should look forward with a thrill. If\r\nthe past is terrible, the future is in the same degree cheering and\r\ninviting. If we came out of those lowly and groveling forms, to\r\nwhat heights of being may we not be carried by the impetus that\r\nbrought us thus far? In fact, to what heights has it already carried\r\nus!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the hazards of the past, to many forms of life, at least, have\r\nbeen real and no myth, is evident from the vast number of forms that\r\nhave been cut off and become extinct; various causes, now hard to\r\ndecipher, have worked together to the end, such as changed\r\ngeographical conditions, changes of climate, affecting the\r\nfood-supply, extreme specialization, like that of the sabre-toothed\r\ntiger whose petrified remains have been found in various parts of\r\nthis continent, and who apparently was finally handicapped by his\r\nhuge dental sabre. Probably many more species of animals have become\r\nextinct than have survived, but none of these could have been in the\r\nline of man's descent, else the human race would not have been here.\r\nIf the Eocene progenitor of the horse, the little four-toed\r\neohippus, had been cut off, would not the world have been horseless\r\nto-day? The horse in America became extinct, from some cause only\r\nconjectural, many tens of thousands of years ago. Had the same fate\r\nbefallen the horse in Europe and Asia, it seems probable that our\r\ncivilization would have been far less advanced to-day than it is.\r\n\r\nThe fate of every species of mammal in our time seems to have been\r\nin the keeping of a single form in early Tertiary times. The end of\r\nthe Cretaceous or chalk period saw the extinction of the giant\r\nreptiles both of sea and of land, at the same time that it saw the\r\nappearance of a great many species of small and inconspicuous\r\nmammals, among which doubtless were our own humble forebears.\r\nExtreme specialization in any direction may narrow an animal's\r\nchances of survival; they have but one chance in the game of life,\r\nwhereas an animal with a more generalized organization has many\r\nchances. Man is one of the most generalized of animals; no special\r\ntools, no special weapons--his hand many tools and weapons in one.\r\nHence he is the most adaptable of animals; all climes, all foods,\r\nall places are his; he is master of the land, of the sea, of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAnimal life is often curiously interdependent. I asked our guide in\r\nthe Adirondacks if there were any ravens there. \"Not nearly as many\r\nas there used to be,\" he said, and his explanation of their\r\ndisappearance seems thoroughly scientific; it was that the wolves\r\nand the panthers kept them in meat, and now that these animals had\r\ndisappeared, the ravens had little to feed upon. If the moose were\r\ncompelled to graze from off the ground, like a sheep or a cow, the\r\nspecies would probably soon become extinct. Osborn thinks it\r\nprobable that the huge beast called titanothere finally became\r\nextinct early in Tertiary times owing to the form of its teeth,\r\nwhich were of such a type that they could not change to meet a\r\nchange in the flora upon which the creature fed. Of course we shall\r\nnever know what narrow escapes our race had from extinction in the\r\nremote past; some forms have ended in a blind alley, like the\r\nsea-urchin and the oyster. Arthropoda have continued to evolve and\r\nhave reached their high-water mark of intelligence in bees and\r\nants. The vertebrates went forward and have culminated in man.\r\nBergson thinks that in the vertebrates intelligence has been\r\ndeveloped at the expense of instinct, and that in the invertebrates\r\ninstinct has been perfected at the expense of intelligence.\r\n\r\nAre we not compelled to adopt what is called the monophyletic\r\nhypothesis, that is, that our line of descent started from one pair,\r\nmale and female, somewhere in the vast stretch of geologic or\r\nbiologic time, and to reason that, had that pair been out of the\r\nrace, we should not have appeared?\r\n\r\nCan we narrow life to a single point, a single cell, in the past?\r\nWas there one and only one first bit of protoplasm? If we were to\r\nsay that life first appeared on the globe in Cambrian times, just\r\nwhat should we mean? That it began as a single point, or as many\r\npoints? When we say that the primates first appeared in Eocene\r\ntimes, do we mean that one single primate appeared then? If so, what\r\nform went immediately before him? This is all a vain speculation.\r\n\r\nDoes man presuppose all the vertebrate sub-kingdom? Was he safe as\r\nlong as one vertebrate form remained? Are his forebears many, and\r\nnot one pair? Can we think of his ancestry under the image of a\r\ntree, and of him as one of the many branches? If so, nothing but the\r\ndestruction of the tree would have imperiled his appearance, or the\r\nlopping off of his particular branch. Probably all such images are\r\nmisleading. We simply cannot figure to ourselves the tangled course\r\nof our biological descent. If thwartings and accidents arid delays\r\ncould have cut man off, how could he have escaped? We cannot think\r\nof man as one; we are compelled to think of him as many; and yet in\r\nall our experience the many come from the one, or the one pair.\r\n\r\nHow thick the field of animal life in the past is strewn with\r\nextinct forms!--as thick as the sidereal spaces are strewn with the\r\nfragments of wrecked worlds! But other worlds and suns are spun out\r\nof the wrecked worlds and suns through the process of cosmic\r\nevolution. The world-stuff is worked over and over. Extinct animal\r\nforms must have given rise to other, allied forms before they\r\nperished, and these to still others, and so on down to our time.\r\n\r\nThe image of a tree is misleading from the fact that all the\r\ndifferent branches of the animal kingdom, from the protozoa up to\r\nman, have come along with what we call the higher branches, the\r\nmammals; the suckers have kept pace with the main stalk, so that we\r\nhave the image of a sheaf of branches starting from a common origin\r\nand all of equal length. Man has brought on his relations along with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere is no glamour of romance over that past. It was all hard,\r\nprosy, terrible fact. The earth's crust was less stable than now,\r\nthe upheavals and subsidences and earthquakes more frequent, the\r\nwarring of the elements more fierce and incessant, deluge and\r\ninundation in more rapid succession, and the riot and excesses of\r\nanimal life far beyond anything we know of. And our line of descent\r\nwas taking its chances amid it all. The widespread blotting out of\r\nlife at the end of Palaeozoic time, and again at the end of Mesozoic\r\ntimes, when myriads of forms were cut off, probably from some\r\nconvulsion of nature or some cosmic catastrophe; and again during\r\nthe ice age, when the camel, the llama, the horse, the tapir, the\r\nmastodon, the elephant, the giant sloth, became extinct in North\r\nAmerica--how fared it with our ancestor during these terrible ages?\r\nThere is no sure trace of him till late Tertiary times, and it is\r\nprobably not more than two hundred thousand years ago that he\r\nassumed the upright attitude and began to use tools. Probably in\r\nEurope fifty thousand years ago he was living in caves, clothed in\r\nskins, contending with the cave bear and cave lion, using rude stone\r\nimplements, and hunting the hairy mastodon, etc. In Asia the\r\nprobabilities are that he was farther on the road toward the dawn of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nWe may think of our descent in the historic period under the image\r\nof the stream, though of a stream many times delayed and diverted,\r\neven many times diminished by wars and plagues and famine, but a\r\nstream with some sort of unity and continuity, since man became man.\r\nThe stream of life is like any other stream in this respect. Divert\r\nor use up part of the water of a stream, yet what is left flows on\r\nand keeps up the continuity and identity of the stream; dip your cup\r\ninto it here, and you will not get precisely the same water you\r\nwould have got had none of it been diverted or used far back in its\r\ncourse--you get the water that was allowed to flow by.\r\n\r\nHad there been no loss of life by war and pestilence and accidents\r\nof various kinds, the different countries would have been occupied\r\nby quite other men and women than those that fill them to-day. The\r\ncourse of life in every neighborhood is changed by what seem like\r\naccidental causes, as when a family is practically wiped out by some\r\naccident or dread disease. This brings new people on the scene. The\r\nfarm or the business falls into other hands, and new social\r\nrelations spring up, new men and women are brought together or the\r\nold ones driven apart, marriage is hastened or retarded,\r\nopportunities for family life are made or unmade, and fewer\r\nchildren, or more children, as the case may be, are the result. The\r\nissue of some battle hundreds or thousands of years ago may have\r\nplayed a part in your life and mine to-day--other races, other\r\nindividuals of the race, would have been thrown together had the\r\nissue been different, and other families started, so that some one\r\nelse would have been here in our stead.\r\n\r\nBut the question of hazard to the race of man in geologic time is\r\nquite a different one. Here our fate seems to hang by a single\r\nthread--a golden thread, we may call it, but, in that terrible maze\r\nof clashing forces and devouring forms of the vast geologic periods,\r\nhow liable to be broken! It is not now a question of the continuity\r\nof a stream, but of the continuity of a single evolutionary process,\r\nor, as Haeckel says, the continuity of the morphological chain which\r\nstretches from the lemurs up through tailed and tailless anthropoid\r\napes to man. If the evolutionary impulse had been checked or\r\nextinguished in the lemur--that small apelike animal that went\r\nbefore the true ape, the fossil remains of which have been found on\r\nthis continent and the survivals of which are now found in\r\nMadagascar--would man have appeared? Again, if the race of lemurs\r\ndeveloped from a single pair, how precarious seems our fate! In\r\nfact, if any of the transitional forms between species can be\r\nreduced to a single pair--as the forms that connect the reptiles\r\nwith the mammals--our fate would seem to be in the keeping of these\r\nforms. Over this single frail bridge which escaped the floods and\r\nthe tornadoes and the earthquakes of those terrible ages we must\r\nhave passed. What risky business it all seems! Was it luck or law\r\nthat favored us? Doubtless, if we could penetrate the mystery, we\r\nshould see that there was no chance or risk in the matter. We cannot\r\ngo very far in solving these great fundamental questions by applying\r\nto them the tests of our own experience, Numberless specific forms\r\nbecome extinct, but the impulse that begat the form does not die\r\nout. Thus, all the giant reptiles died out--the dinosaurs, the\r\nmesosaurs--but the reptilian impulse still survives. How many types\r\nof invertebrates have perished! but the invertebrate impulse still\r\ngoes on. How many species of mammals have been cut off! yet the\r\nmammal impulse has steadily gone forward. These things suggest the\r\nwave that moves on but leaves the water behind. The vertebrate\r\nimpulse began in wormlike forms, in the old Palaeozoic seas, and\r\nstopped not till it culminated in man. This impulse has left many\r\nforms behind it; but has this impulse itself ever been endangered?\r\nIf one looks at the matter thus in an abstract instead of a concrete\r\nway, the problem of our descent becomes easier.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the evolution of life on a grand scale, nature seems\r\nto feel her way, like a blind man, groping, hesitating, trying this\r\nroad and then that. In some cases the line of evolution seems to end\r\nin a cul de sac beyond which no progress is possible. The forms thus\r\ncornered soon become extinct. The mystery, the unaccountable thing,\r\nis the appearance of new characters. The slow modification or\r\ntransformation of an existing character may often be traced; natural\r\nselection, or the struggle for existence, takes it in hand and\r\nadapts and perpetuates it, or else eliminates it. But the origin of\r\ncertain new parts or characters--that is the secret of the\r\nevolutionary process. Thus there was a time when no animal had\r\nhorns; then horns appeared. \"In the great quadruped known as\r\ntitanothere,\" says Osborn, \"rudiments of horns first arise\r\nindependently at certain definite parts of the skull; they arise at\r\nfirst alike in both sexes, or asexually; then they become sexual, or\r\nchiefly characteristic of males; then they rapidly evolve in the\r\nmales while being arrested in development in the females; finally,\r\nthey become in some of the animals dominant characteristics to which\r\nall others bend.\" Nature seems to throw out these new characters and\r\nthen lets them take their chances in the clash of forces and\r\ntendencies that go on in the arena of life. If they serve a purpose\r\nor are an advantage, they remain; if not, they drop out. Nature\r\nfeels her way. The horns proved of less advantage to the females\r\nthan to the males; they seem a part of the plus or overflow of the\r\nmale principle, like the beard in man--the badge of masculinity. The\r\ntitanothere is traceable back to a hornless animal the size of a\r\nsheep, and it ended in a horned quadruped nearly as large as an\r\nelephant. It flourished in Wyoming in early Tertiary times. Nature\r\ndid not seem to know what to do with horns when she first got them.\r\nShe played with them like a child with a new toy. Thus she gave two\r\npairs to several species of mammals, one pair on the nose and one\r\npair on the top of the skull--certainly an embarrassment of weapons.\r\n\r\nThe first horns appear to have been crude, heavy, uncouth, but long\r\nbefore we reach our own geologic era they appear in various species\r\nof quadrupeds, and become graceful and ornamental. How beautiful\r\nthey are in many of the African antelope tribe! Nature's workmanship\r\nnearly always improves with time, like that of man's, and sooner or\r\nlater takes on an ornamental phase.\r\n\r\nThe early uncouth, bizarre forms seem to be the result of the excess\r\nor surplus of life. Life in remote biologic times was rank and\r\nriotous, as it is now, in a measure, in tropical lands. One reason\r\nmay be that the climate of the globe during the middle period, and\r\nwell into the third period, appears to have been of a tropical\r\ncharacter. The climatic and seasonal divisions were not at all\r\npronounced, and both animal and vegetable life took on gigantic and\r\ngrotesque forms. In the ugliness of alligator and rhinoceros and\r\nhippopotamus of our day we get some hint of what early reptilian and\r\nmammalian life was like.\r\n\r\nThat Nature should have turned out better and better handiwork as\r\nthe ages passed; that she either should have improved upon every\r\nmodel or else discarded it; that she should have progressed from the\r\nbird, half-dragon, to the sweet songsters of our day and to the\r\nsuperb forms of the air that we know; that evolution should have\r\nentered upon a refining and spiritualizing phase, developing larger\r\nbrains and smaller bodies, is a very significant fact, and one quite\r\nbeyond the range of the mechanistic conception of life.\r\n\r\nOur own immediate line of descent leads down through the minor forms\r\nof Tertiary and Mesozoic times--forms that probably skulked and\r\ndodged about amid the terrible and gigantic creatures of those ages\r\nas the small game of to-day hide and flee from the presence of their\r\narch-enemy, man; and that the frail line upon which the fate of the\r\nhuman race hung should not have been severed during the wild turmoil\r\nof those ages is, to me, a source of perpetual wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hazards of the future of the race must be quite different from\r\nthose I have been considering. They are the hazards incident to an\r\nexceptional being upon this earth--a being that takes his fate in\r\nhis own hands in a sense that no other creature does.\r\n\r\nMan has partaken of the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil, which\r\nall the lower orders have escaped. He knows, and knows that he\r\nknows. Will this knowledge, through the opposition in which it\r\nplaces him to elemental nature and the vast system of artificial\r\nthings with which it has enabled him to surround himself, cut short\r\nhis history upon this planet? Will Nature in the end be avenged for\r\nthe secrets he has forced from her? His civilization has doubtless\r\nmade him the victim of diseases to which the lower orders, and even\r\nsavage man, are strangers. Will not these diseases increase as his\r\nlife becomes more and more complex and artificial? Will he go on\r\nextending his mastery over Nature and refining or suppressing his\r\nnatural appetites till his original hold upon life is fatally\r\nenfeebled?\r\n\r\nIt seems as though science ought to save man and prolong his stay on\r\nthis planet,--it ought to bring him natural salvation, as his\r\nreligion promises him supernatural salvation. But of course, man's\r\nfate is bound up with the fate of the planet and of the biological\r\ntree of which he is one of the shoots. Biology is rooted in geology.\r\nThe higher forms of life did not arbitrarily appear, they flowed out\r\nof conditions that were long in maturing; they flowered in season,\r\nand the flower will fall in season. Man could not have appeared\r\nearlier than he did, nor later than he did; he came out of what went\r\nbefore, and he will go out with what comes after. His coming was\r\nnatural, and his going will be natural. His period had a beginning,\r\nand it will have an end. Natural philosophy leads one to affirm\r\nthis; but of time measured by human history he may yet have a lease\r\nof tens of thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe hazard of the future is a question of both astronomy and\r\ngeology. That there are cosmic dangers, though infinitely remote,\r\nevery astronomer knows. That there are collisions between heavenly\r\nbodies is an indubitable fact, and if collisions do happen to any,\r\nallow time enough and they must happen to all. That there are\r\ngeologic dangers through the shifting and crumpling of the earth's\r\ncrust, every geologist knows, though probably none that could wipe\r\nout the whole race of man. The biologic dangers of the past we have\r\noutlived--the dangers that must have beset a single line of descent\r\namid the carnival of power and the ferocity of the monster reptiles\r\nof Mesozoic times, and the wholesale extinction of species that\r\noccurred in different geologic periods.\r\n\r\nNothing but a cosmic catastrophe, involving the fate of the whole\r\nearth, could now exterminate the human race. It is highly improbable\r\nthat this will ever happen. The race of man will go out from a slow,\r\ninsensible failure, through the aging of the planet, of the\r\nconditions of life that brought man here. The evolutionary process\r\nupon a cooling world must, after the elapse of a vast period of\r\ntime, lose its impetus and cease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE GOSPEL OF NATURE\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day a clergyman who described himself as a preacher of the\r\ngospel of Christ wrote, asking me to come and talk to his people on\r\nthe gospel of Nature. The request set me to thinking whether or not\r\nNature has any gospel in the sense the clergyman had in mind, any\r\nmessage that is likely to be specially comforting to the average\r\northodox religious person. I suppose the parson wished me to tell\r\nhis flock what I had found in Nature that was a strength or a solace\r\nto myself.\r\n\r\nWhat had all my many years of journeyings to Nature yielded me that\r\nwould supplement or reinforce the gospel he was preaching? Had the\r\nbirds taught me any valuable lessons? Had the four-footed beasts?\r\nHad the insects? Had the flowers, the trees, the soil, the coming\r\nand the going of the seasons? Had I really found sermons in stones,\r\nbooks in running brooks and good in everything? Had the lilies of\r\nthe field, that neither toil nor spin, and yet are more royally clad\r\nthan Solomon in all his glory, helped me in any way to clothe myself\r\nwith humility, with justice, with truthfulness?\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for one to say just what he owes to all these things.\r\nNatural influences work indirectly as well as directly; they work\r\nupon the subconscious, as well as upon the conscious, self. That I\r\nam a saner, healthier, more contented man, with truer standards of\r\nlife, for all my loiterings in the fields and woods, I am fully\r\nconvinced.\r\n\r\nThat I am less social, less interested in my neighbors and in the\r\nbody politic, more inclined to shirk civic and social\r\nresponsibilities and to stop my ears against the brawling of the\r\nreformers, is perhaps equally true.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, in a hygienic way I owe much to my excursions\r\nto Nature. They have helped to clothe me with health, if not with\r\nhumility; they have helped sharpen and attune all my senses; they\r\nhave kept my eyes in such good trim that they have not failed me for\r\none moment during all the seventy-five years I have had them; they\r\nhave made my sense of smell so keen that I have much pleasure in the\r\nwild, open-air perfumes, especially in the spring--the delicate\r\nbreath of the blooming elms and maples and willows, the breath of\r\nthe woods, of the pastures, of the shore. This keen, healthy sense\r\nof smell has made me abhor tobacco and flee from close rooms, and\r\nput the stench of cities behind me. I fancy that this whole world of\r\nwild, natural perfumes is lost to the tobacco-user and to the city-\r\ndweller. Senses trained in the open air are in tune with open-air\r\nobjects; they are quick, delicate, and discriminating. When I go to\r\ntown, my ear suffers as well as my nose: the impact of the city upon\r\nmy senses is hard and dissonant; the ear is stunned, the nose is\r\noutraged, and the eye is confused. When I come back, I go to Nature\r\nto be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in tune once\r\nmore. I know that, as a rule, country or farming folk are not\r\nremarkable for the delicacy of their senses, but this is owing\r\nmainly to the benumbing and brutalizing effect of continued hard\r\nlabor. It is their minds more than their bodies that suffer.\r\n\r\nWhen I have dwelt in cities the country was always near by, and I\r\nused to get a bite of country soil at least once a week to keep my\r\nsystem normal.\r\n\r\nEmerson says that \"the day does not seem wholly profane in which we\r\nhave given heed to some natural object.\" If Emerson had stopped to\r\nqualify his remark, he would have added, if we give heed to it in\r\nthe right spirit, if we give heed to it as a nature-lover and\r\ntruth-seeker. Nature love as Emerson knew it, and as Wordsworth knew\r\nit, and as any of the choicer spirits of our time have known it, has\r\ndistinctly a religious value. It does not come to a man or a woman\r\nwho is wholly absorbed in selfish or worldly or material ends.\r\nExcept ye become in a measure as little children, ye cannot enter\r\nthe kingdom of Nature--as Audubon entered it, as Thoreau entered it,\r\nas Bryant and Amiel entered it, and as all those enter it who make\r\nit a resource in their lives and an instrument of their culture. The\r\nforms and creeds of religion change, but the sentiment of\r\nreligion--the wonder and reverence and love we feel in the presence\r\nof the inscrutable universe--persists. Indeed, these seem to be\r\nrenewing their life to-day in this growing love for all natural\r\nobjects and in this increasing tenderness toward all forms of life.\r\nIf we do not go to church so much as did our fathers, we go to the\r\nwoods much more, and are much more inclined to make a temple of them\r\nthan they were.\r\n\r\nWe now use the word Nature very much as our fathers used the word\r\nGod, and, I suppose, back of it all we mean the power that is\r\neverywhere present and active, and in whose lap the visible universe\r\nis held and nourished. It is a power that we can see and touch and\r\nhear, and realize every moment of our lives how absolutely we are\r\ndependent upon it. There are no atheists or skeptics in regard to\r\nthis power. All men see how literally we are its children, and all\r\nmen learn how swift and sure is the penalty of disobedience to its\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nOur associations with Nature vulgarize it and rob it of its\r\ndivinity. When we come to see that the celestial and the terrestrial\r\nare one, that time and eternity are one, that mind and matter are\r\none, that death and life are one, that there is and can be nothing\r\nnot inherent in Nature, then we no longer look for or expect a\r\nfar-off, unknown God.\r\n\r\nNature teaches more than she preaches. There are no sermons in\r\nstones. It is easier to get a spark out of a stone than a moral.\r\nEven when it contains a fossil, it teaches history rather than\r\nmorals. It comes down from the fore-world an undigested bit that has\r\nresisted the tooth and maw of time, and can tell you many things if\r\nyou have the eye to read them. The soil upon which it lies or in\r\nwhich it is imbedded was rock, too, back in geologic time, but the\r\nmill that ground it up passed the fragment of stone through without\r\nentirely reducing it. Very likely it is made up of the minute\r\nremains of innumerable tiny creatures that lived and died in the\r\nancient seas. Very likely it was torn from its parent rock and\r\nbrought to the place where it now lies by the great ice-flood that\r\nmany tens of thousands of years ago crept slowly but irresistibly\r\ndown out of the North over the greater part of all the northern\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\nBut all this appeals to the intellect, and contains no lesson for\r\nthe moral nature. If we are to find sermons in stones, we are to\r\nlook for them in the relations of the stones to other things--when\r\nthey are out of place, when they press down the grass or the\r\nflowers, or impede the plow, or dull the scythe, or usurp the soil,\r\nor shelter vermin, as do old institutions and old usages that have\r\nhad their day. A stone that is much knocked about gets its sharp\r\nangles worn off, as do men. \"A rolling stone gathers no moss,\" which\r\nis not bad for the stone, as moss hastens decay. \"Killing two birds\r\nwith one stone\" is a bad saying, because it reminds boys to stone\r\nthe birds, which is bad for both boys and birds. But \"People who\r\nlive in glass houses should not throw stones\" is on the right side\r\nof the account, as it discourages stone-throwing and reminds us that\r\nwe are no better than our neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe lesson in running brooks is that motion is a great purifier and\r\nhealth-producer. When the brook ceases to run, it soon stagnates. It\r\nkeeps in touch with the great vital currents when it is in motion,\r\nand unites with other brooks to help make the river. In motion it\r\nsoon leaves all mud and sediment behind. Do not proper work and the\r\nexercise of will power have the same effect upon our lives?\r\n\r\nThe other day in my walk I came upon a sap-bucket that had been\r\nleft standing by the maple tree all the spring and summer. What a\r\nbucketful of corruption was that, a mixture of sap and rainwater\r\nthat had rotted, and smelled to heaven. Mice and birds and insects\r\nhad been drowned in it, and added to its unsavory character. It was\r\na bit of Nature cut off from the vitalizing and purifying chem-\r\nistry of the whole. With what satisfaction I emptied it upon the\r\nground while I held my nose and saw it filter into the turf, where I\r\nknew it was dying to go and where I knew every particle of the\r\nreeking, fetid fluid would soon be made sweet and wholesome again by\r\nthe chemistry of the soil!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not always in sympathy with nature-study as pursued in the\r\nschools, as if this kingdom could be carried by assault. Such study\r\nis too cold, too special, too mechanical; it is likely to rub the\r\nbloom off Nature. It lacks soul and emotion; it misses the\r\naccessories of the open air and its exhilarations, the sky, the\r\nclouds, the landscape, and the currents of life that pulse\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\nI myself have never made a dead set at studying Nature with\r\nnote-book and field-glass in hand. I have rather visited with her.\r\nWe have walked together or sat down together, and our intimacy grows\r\nwith the seasons. What I have learned about her ways I have learned\r\neasily, almost unconsciously, while fishing or camping or idling\r\nabout. My desultory habits have their disadvantages, no doubt, but\r\nthey have their advantages also. A too strenuous pursuit defeats\r\nitself. In the fields and woods more than anywhere else all things\r\ncome to those who wait, because all things are on the move, and are\r\nsure sooner or later to come your way.\r\n\r\nTo absorb a thing is better than to learn it, and we absorb what we\r\nenjoy. We learn things at school, we absorb them in the fields and\r\nwoods and on the farm. When we look upon Nature with fondness and\r\nappreciation she meets us halfway and takes a deeper hold upon us\r\nthan when studiously conned. Hence I say the way of knowledge of\r\nNature is the way of love and enjoyment, and is more surely found in\r\nthe open air than in the school-room or the laboratory. The other\r\nday I saw a lot of college girls dissecting cats and making diagrams\r\nof the circulation and muscle-attachments, and I thought it pretty\r\npoor business unless the girls were taking a course in comparative\r\nanatomy with a view to some occupation in life. What is the moral\r\nand intellectual value of this kind of knowledge to those girls?\r\nBiology is, no doubt, a great science in the hands of great men, but\r\nit is not for all. I myself have got along very well without it. I\r\nam sure I can learn more of what I want to know from a kitten on my\r\nknee than from the carcass of a cat in the laboratory. Darwin spent\r\neight years dissecting barnacles; but he was Darwin, and did not\r\nstop at barnacles, as these college girls are pretty sure to stop at\r\ncats. He dissected and put together again in his mental laboratory\r\nthe whole system of animal life, and the upshot of his work was a\r\ntremendous gain to our understanding of the universe.\r\n\r\nI would rather see the girls in the fields and woods studying and\r\nenjoying living nature, training their eyes to see correctly and\r\ntheir hearts to respond intelligently. What is knowledge without\r\nenjoyment, without love? It is sympathy, appreciation, emotional\r\nexperience, which refine and elevate and breathe into exact\r\nknowledge the breath of life. My own interest is in living nature as\r\nit moves and flourishes about me winter and summer.\r\n\r\nI know it is one thing to go forth as a nature-lover, and quite\r\nanother to go forth in a spirit of cold, calculating, exact science.\r\nI call myself a nature-lover and not a scientific naturalist. All\r\nthat science has to tell me is welcome, is, indeed, eagerly sought\r\nfor. I must know as well as feel. I am not merely contented, like\r\nWordsworth's poet, to enjoy what others understand. I must\r\nunderstand also; but above all things I must enjoy. How much of my\r\nenjoyment springs from my knowledge I do not know. The joy of\r\nknowing is very great; the delight of picking up the threads of\r\nmeaning here and there, and following them through the maze of\r\nconfusing facts, I know well. When I hear the woodpecker drumming on\r\na dry limb in spring or the grouse drumming in the woods, and know\r\nwhat it is all for, why, that knowledge, I suppose, is part of my\r\nenjoyment. The other part is the associations that those sounds call\r\nup as voicing the arrival of spring: they are the drums that lead\r\nthe joyous procession.\r\n\r\nTo enjoy understandingly, that, I fancy, is the great thing to be\r\ndesired. When I see the large ichneumon-fly, Thalessa, making a loop\r\nover her back with her long ovipositor and drilling a hole in the\r\ntrunk of a tree, I do not fully appreciate the spectacle till I know\r\nshe is feeling for the burrow of a tree-borer, Tremex, upon the\r\nlarvae of which her own young feed. She must survey her territory\r\nlike an oil-digger and calculate where she is likely to strike oil,\r\nwhich in her case is the burrow of her host Tremex. There is a vast\r\nseries of facts in natural history like this that are of little\r\ninterest until we understand them. They are like the outside of a\r\nbook which may attract us, but which can mean little to us until we\r\nhave opened and perused its pages.\r\n\r\nThe nature-lover is not looking for mere facts, but for meanings,\r\nfor something he can translate into the terms of his own life. He\r\nwants facts, but significant facts--luminous facts that throw light\r\nupon the ways of animate and inanimate nature. A bird picking up\r\ncrumbs from my window-sill does not mean much to me. It is a\r\npleasing sight and touches a tender cord, but it does not add much\r\nto my knowledge of bird-life. But when I see a bird pecking and\r\nfluttering angrily at my window-pane, as I now and then do in\r\nspring, apparently under violent pressure to get in, I am witnessing\r\na significant comedy in bird-life, one that illustrates the limits\r\nof animal instinct. The bird takes its own reflected image in the\r\nglass for a hated rival, and is bent on demolishing it. Let the\r\nassaulting bird get a glimpse of the inside of the empty room\r\nthrough a broken pane, and it is none the wiser; it returns to the\r\nassault as vigorously as ever.\r\n\r\nThe fossils in the rocks did not mean much to the earlier\r\ngeologists. They looked upon them as freaks of Nature, whims of the\r\ncreative energy, or vestiges of Noah's flood. You see they were\r\nblinded by the preconceived notions of the six-day theory of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not know that the bird has taught me any valuable lesson.\r\nIndeed, I do not go to Nature to be taught. I go for enjoyment and\r\ncompanionship. I go to bathe in her as in a sea; I go to give my\r\neyes and ears and all my senses a free, clean field and to tone up\r\nmy spirits by her \"primal sanities.\" If the bird has not preached to\r\nme, it has added to the resources of my life, it has widened the\r\nfield of my interests, it has afforded me another beautiful object\r\nto love, and has helped make me feel more at home in this world. To\r\ntake the birds out of my life would be like lopping off so many\r\nbranches from the tree: there is so much less surface of leafage to\r\nabsorb the sunlight and bring my spirits in contact with the vital\r\ncurrents. We cannot pursue any natural study with love and\r\nenthusiasm without the object of it becoming a part of our lives.\r\nThe birds, the flowers, the trees, the rocks, all become linked with\r\nour lives and hold the key to our thoughts and emotions.\r\n\r\nNot till the bird becomes a part of your life can its coming and its\r\ngoing mean much to you. And it becomes a part of your life when you\r\nhave taken heed of it with interest and affection, when you have\r\nestablished associations with it, when it voices the spring or the\r\nsummer to you, when it calls up the spirit of the woods or the\r\nfields or the shore. When year after year you have heard the veery\r\nin the beech and birch woods along the trout streams, or the wood\r\nthrush May after May in the groves where you have walked or sat, and\r\nthe bobolink summer after summer in the home meadows, or the vesper\r\nsparrow in the upland pastures where you have loitered as a boy or\r\nmused as a man, these birds will really be woven into the texture of\r\nyour life.\r\n\r\nWhat lessons the birds have taught me I cannot recall; what a joy\r\nthey have been to me I know well. In a new place, amid strange\r\nscenes, theirs are the voices and the faces of old friends. In\r\nBermuda the bluebirds and the catbirds and the cardinals seemed to\r\nmake American territory of it. Our birds had annexed the island\r\ndespite the Britishers.\r\n\r\nFor many years I have in late April seen the red-poll warbler,\r\nperhaps for only a single day, flitting about as I walked or worked.\r\nIt is usually my first warbler, and my associations with it are very\r\npleasing. But I really did not know how pleasing until, one March\r\nday, when I was convalescing from a serious illness in one of our\r\nsea-coast towns, I chanced to spy the little traveler in a vacant\r\nlot along the street, now upon the ground, now upon a bush, nervous\r\nand hurried as usual, uttering its sharp chip, and showing the white\r\nin its tail. The sight gave me a real home feeling. It did me more\r\ngood than the medicine I was taking. It instantly made a living link\r\nwith many past springs. Anything that calls up a happy past, how it\r\nwarms the present! There, too, that same day I saw my first\r\nmeadowlark of the season in a vacant lot, flashing out the white\r\nquills in her tail, and walking over the turf in the old, erect,\r\nalert manner. The sight was as good as a letter from home, and\r\nbetter: it had a flavor of the wild and of my boyhood days on the\r\nold farm that no letter could ever have.\r\n\r\nThe spring birds always awaken a thrill wherever I am. The first\r\nbobolink I hear flying over northward and bursting out in song now\r\nand then, full of anticipation of those broad meadows where he will\r\nsoon be with his mate; or the first swallow twittering joyously\r\noverhead, borne on a warm southern breeze; or the first high-hole\r\nsounding out his long, iterated call from the orchard or field--how\r\nall these things send a wave of emotion over me!\r\n\r\nPleasures of another kind are to find a new bird, and to see an old\r\nbird in a new place, as I did recently in the old sugar-bush where I\r\nused to help gather and boil sap as a boy. It was the logcock, or\r\npileated woodpecker, a rare bird anywhere, and one I had never seen\r\nbefore on the old farm. I heard his loud cackle in a maple tree, saw\r\nhim flit from branch to branch for a few moments, and then launch\r\nout and fly toward a distant wood. But he left an impression with me\r\nthat I should be sorry to have missed.\r\n\r\nNature stimulates our aesthetic and our intellectual life and to a\r\ncertain extent our religious emotions, but I fear we cannot find\r\nmuch support for our ethical system in the ways of wild Nature. I\r\nknow our artist naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, claims to find\r\nwhat we may call the biological value of the Ten Commandments in the\r\nlives of the wild animals; but I cannot make his reasoning hold\r\nwater, at least not much of it. Of course the Ten Commandments are\r\nnot arbitrary laws. They are largely founded upon the needs of the\r\nsocial organism; but whether they have the same foundation in the\r\nneeds of animal life apart from man, apart from the world of moral\r\nobligation, is another question. The animals are neither moral nor\r\nimmoral: they are unmoral; their needs are all physical. It is true\r\nthat the command against murder is pretty well kept by the higher\r\nanimals. They rarely kill their own kind: hawks do not prey upon\r\nhawks, nor foxes prey upon foxes, nor weasels upon weasels; but\r\nlower down this does not hold. Trout eat trout, and pickerel eat\r\npickerel, and among the insects young spiders eat one another, and\r\nthe female spider eats her mate, if she can get him. There is but\r\nlittle, if any, neighborly love among even the higher animals. They\r\ntreat one another as rivals, or associate for mutual protection. One\r\ncow will lick and comb another in the most affectionate manner, and\r\nthe next moment savagely gore her. Hate and cruelty for the most\r\npart rule in the animal world. A few of the higher animals are\r\nmonogamous, but by far the greater number of species are polygamous\r\nor promiscuous. There is no mating or pairing in the great bovine\r\ntribe, and none among the rodents that I know of, or among the bear\r\nfamily, or the cat family, or among the seals. When we come to the\r\nbirds, we find mating, and occasional pairing for life, as with the\r\nostrich and perhaps the eagle.\r\n\r\nAs for the rights of property among the animals, I do not see how we\r\ncan know just how far those rights are respected among individuals\r\nof the same species. We know that bees will rob bees, and that ants\r\nwill rob ants; but whether or not one chipmunk or one flying\r\nsquirrel or one wood mouse will plunder the stores of another I do\r\nnot know. Probably not, as the owner of such stores is usually on\r\nhand to protect them. Moreover, these provident little creatures all\r\nlay up stores in the autumn, before the season of scarcity sets in,\r\nand so have no need to plunder one another. In case the stores of\r\none squirrel were destroyed by some means, and it were able to\r\ndispossess another of its hoard, would it not in that case be a\r\nsurvival of the fittest, and so conducive to the well-being of the\r\nrace of squirrels?\r\n\r\nI have never known any of our wild birds to steal the\r\nnesting-material of another bird of the same kind, but I have known\r\nbirds to try to carry off the material belonging to other species.\r\n\r\nBut usually the rule of might is the rule of right among the\r\nanimals. As to most of the other commandments,--of coveting, of\r\nbearing false witness, of honoring the father and the mother, and so\r\nforth,--how can these apply to the animals or have any biological\r\nvalue to them? Parental obedience among them is not a very definite\r\nthing. There is neither obedience nor disobedience, because there\r\nare no commands. The alarm-cries of the parents are quickly\r\nunderstood by the young, and their actions imitated in the presence\r\nof danger, all of which of course has a biological value.\r\n\r\nThe instances which Mr. Seton cites of animals fleeing to man for\r\nprotection from their enemies prove to my mind only how the greater\r\nfear drives out the lesser. The hotly pursued animal sees a possible\r\ncover in a group of men and horses or in an unoccupied house, and\r\nrushes there to hide. What else could the act mean? So a hunted deer\r\nor sheep will leap from a precipice which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, it would avoid. So would a man. Fear makes bold in\r\nsuch cases.\r\n\r\nI certainly have found \"good in everything,\"--in all natural\r\nprocesses and products,--not the \"good\" of the Sunday-school books,\r\nbut the good of natural law and order, the good of that system of\r\nthings out of which we came and which is the source of our health\r\nand strength. It is good that fire should burn, even if it consumes\r\nyour house; it is good that force should crush, even if it crushes\r\nyou; it is good that rain should fall, even if it destroys your\r\ncrops or floods your land. Plagues and pestilences attest the\r\nconstancy of natural law. They set us to cleaning our streets and\r\nhouses and to readjusting our relations to outward nature. Only in a\r\nlive universe could disease and death prevail. Death is a phase of\r\nlife, a redistributing of the type. Decay is another kind of growth.\r\n\r\nYes, good in everything, because law in everything, truth in\r\neverything, the sequence of cause and effect in everything, and it\r\nmay all be good to me if on the right principles I relate my life to\r\nit. I can make the heat and the cold serve me, the winds and the\r\nfloods, gravity and all the chemical and dynamical forces, serve me,\r\nif I take hold of them by the right handle. The bad in things arises\r\nfrom our abuse or misuse of them or from our wrong relations to\r\nthem. A thing is good or bad according as it stands related to my\r\nconstitution. We say the order of nature is rational; but is it not\r\nbecause our reason is the outcome of that order? Our well-being\r\nconsists in learning it and in adjusting our lives to it. When we\r\ncross it or seek to contravene it, we are destroyed. But Nature in\r\nher universal procedures is not rational, as I am rational when I\r\nweed my garden, prune my trees, select my seed or my stock, or arm\r\nmyself with tools or weapons. In such matters I take a short cut to\r\nthat which Nature reaches by a slow, roundabout, and wasteful\r\nprocess. How does she weed her garden? By the survival of the\r\nfittest. How does she select her breeding-stock? By the law of\r\nbattle; the strongest rules. Hers, I repeat, is a slow and wasteful\r\nprocess. She fertilizes the soil by plowing in the crop. She cannot\r\ntake a short cut. She assorts and arranges her goods by the law of\r\nthe winds and the tides. She builds up with one hand and pulls down\r\nwith the other. Man changes the conditions to suit the things.\r\nNature changes the things to suit the conditions. She adapts the\r\nplant or the animal to its environment. She does not drain her\r\nmarshes; she fills them up. Hers is the larger reason--the reason of\r\nthe All. Man's reason introduces a new method; it cuts across,\r\nmodifies, or abridges the order of Nature. I do not see design in\r\nNature in the old ideological sense; but I see everything working to\r\nits own proper end, and that end is foretold in the means. Things\r\nare not designed; things are begotten. It is as if the final plan of\r\na man's house, after he had begun to build it, should be determined\r\nby the winds and the rains and the shape of the ground upon which it\r\nstands. The eye is begotten by those vibrations in the ether called\r\nlight, the ear by those vibrations in the air called sound, the\r\nsense of smell by those emanations called odors. There are probably\r\nother vibrations and emanations that we have no senses for because\r\nour well-being does not demand them.\r\n\r\nWe think it reasonable that a stone should fall and that smoke\r\nshould rise because we have never known either of them to do the\r\ncontrary. We think it reasonable that fire should burn and that\r\nfrost should freeze, because this accords with universal experience.\r\nThus, there is a large order of facts that are reasonable because\r\nthey are invariable: the same effect always follows the same cause.\r\nOur reason is developed and disciplined by observing the order of\r\nNature; and yet human rationality is of another order from the\r\nrationality of Nature. Man learns from Nature how to master and\r\ncontrol her. He turns her currents into new channels; he spurs her\r\nin directions of his own. Nature has no economic or scientific\r\nrationality. She progresses by the method of trial and error. Her\r\nadvance is symbolized by that of the child learning to walk. She\r\nexperiments endlessly. Evolution has worked all around the horizon.\r\nIn feeling her way to man she has produced thousands of other forms\r\nof life. The globe is peopled as it is because the creative energy\r\nwas blind and did not at once find the single straight road to man.\r\nHad the law of variation worked only in one direction, man might\r\nhave found himself the sole occupant of the universe. Behold the\r\nvarieties of trees, of shrubs, of grasses, of birds, of insects,\r\nbecause Nature does not work as man does, with an eye single to one\r\nparticular end. She scatters, she sows her seed upon the wind, she\r\ncommits her germs to the waves and the floods. Nature is indifferent\r\nto waste, because what goes out of one pocket goes into another. She\r\nis indifferent to failure, because failure on one line means success\r\non some other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I am not preaching much of a gospel, am I? Only the gospel of\r\ncontentment, of appreciation, of heeding simple near-by things--a\r\ngospel the burden of which still is love, but love that goes hand in\r\nhand with understanding.\r\n\r\nThere is so much in Nature that is lovely and lovable, and so much\r\nthat gives us pause. But here it is, and here we are, and we must\r\nmake the most of it. If the ways of the Eternal as revealed in his\r\nworks are past finding out, we must still unflinchingly face what\r\nour reason reveals to us. \"Red in tooth and claw.\" Nature does not\r\npreach; she enforces, she executes. All her answers are yea, yea, or\r\nnay, nay. Of the virtues and beatitudes of which the gospel of\r\nChrist makes so much--meekness, forgiveness, self-denial, charity,\r\nlove, holiness--she knows nothing. Put yourself in her way, and she\r\ncrushes you; she burns you, freezes you, stings you, bites you, or\r\ndevours you.\r\n\r\nYet I would not say that the study of Nature did not favor meekness\r\nor sobriety or gentleness or forgiveness or charity, because the\r\ngreat Nature students and prophets, like Darwin, would rise up and\r\nconfound me. Certainly it favors seriousness, truthfulness, and\r\nsimplicity of life; or, are only the serious and single-minded drawn\r\nto the study of Nature? I doubt very much if it favors devoutness or\r\nholiness, as those qualities are inculcated by the church, or any\r\nform of religious enthusiasm. Devoutness and holiness come of an\r\nattitude toward the universe that is in many ways incompatible with\r\nthat implied by the pursuit of natural science. The joy of the\r\nNature student like Darwin or any great naturalist is to know, to\r\nfind out the reason of things and the meaning of things, to trace\r\nthe footsteps of the creative energy; while the religious devotee is\r\nintent only upon losing himself in infinite being. True, there have\r\nbeen devout naturalists and men of science; but their devoutness did\r\nnot date from their Nature studies, but from their training, or from\r\nthe times in which they lived. Theology and science, it must be\r\nsaid, will not mingle much better than oil and water, and your\r\ndevout scientist and devout Nature student lives in two separate\r\ncompartments of his being at different times. Intercourse with\r\nNature--I mean intellectual intercourse, not merely the emotional\r\nintercourse of the sailor or explorer or farmer--tends to beget a\r\nhabit of mind the farthest possible removed from the myth-making,\r\nthe vision-seeing, the voice-hearing habit and temper. In all\r\nmatters relating to the visible, concrete universe it substitutes\r\nbroad daylight for twilight; it supplants fear with curiosity; it\r\noverthrows superstition with fact; it blights credulity with the\r\nfrost of skepticism. I say frost of skepticism advisedly. Skepticism\r\nis a much more healthful and robust habit of mind than the limp,\r\npale-blooded, non-resisting habit that we call credulity.\r\n\r\nIn intercourse with Nature you are dealing with things at first\r\nhand, and you get a rule, a standard, that serves you through life.\r\nYou are dealing with primal sanities, primal honesties, primal\r\nattraction; you are touching at least the hem of the garment with\r\nwhich the infinite is clothed, and virtue goes out from it to you.\r\nIt must be added that you are dealing with primal cruelty, primal\r\nblindness, primal wastefulness, also. Nature works with reference to\r\nno measure of time, no bounds of space, and no limits of material.\r\nHer economies are not our economies. She is prodigal, she is\r\ncareless, she is indifferent; yet nothing is lost. What she lavishes\r\nwith one hand, she gathers in with the other. She is blind, yet she\r\nhits the mark because she shoots in all directions. Her germs fill\r\nthe air; the winds and the tides are her couriers. When you think\r\nyou have defeated her, your triumph is hers; it is still by her laws\r\nthat you reach your end.\r\n\r\nWe make ready our garden in a season, and plant our seeds and hoe\r\nour crops by some sort of system. Can any one tell how many hundreds\r\nof millions of years Nature has been making ready her garden and\r\nplanting her seeds?\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, I think, but that intercourse with Nature\r\nand a knowledge of her ways tends to simplicity of life. We come\r\nmore and more to see through the follies and vanities of the world\r\nand to appreciate the real values. We load ourselves up with so many\r\nfalse burdens, our complex civilization breeds in us so many false\r\nor artificial wants, that we become separated from the real sources\r\nof our strength and health as by a gulf.\r\n\r\nFor my part, as I grow older I am more and more inclined to reduce\r\nmy baggage, to lop off superfluities. I become more and more in love\r\nwith simple things and simple folk--a small house, a hut in the\r\nwoods, a tent on the shore. The show and splendor of great houses,\r\nelaborate furnishings, stately halls, oppress me, impose upon me.\r\nThey fix the attention upon false values, they set up a false\r\nstandard of beauty; they stand between me and the real feeders of\r\ncharacter and thought. A man needs a good roof over his head winter\r\nand summer, and a good chimney and a big wood-pile in winter. The\r\nmore open his four walls are, the more fresh air he will get, and\r\nthe longer he will live.\r\n\r\nHow the contemplation of Nature as a whole does take the conceit out\r\nof us! How we dwindle to mere specks and our little lives to the\r\nspan of a moment in the presence of the cosmic bodies and the\r\ninterstellar spaces! How we hurry! How we husband our time! A year,\r\na month, a day, an hour may mean so much to us. Behold the infinite\r\nleisure of Nature!\r\n\r\nA few trillions or quadrillions of years, what matters it to the\r\nEternal? Jupiter and Saturn must be billions of years older than the\r\nearth. They are evidently yet passing through that condition of\r\ncloud and vapor and heat that the earth passed through untold aeons\r\nago, and they will not reach the stage of life till aeons to come.\r\nBut what matters it? Only man hurries. Only the Eternal has infinite\r\ntime. When life comes to Jupiter, the earth will doubtless long have\r\nbeen a dead world. It may continue a dead world for aeons longer\r\nbefore it is melted up in the eternal crucible and recast, and set\r\non its career of life again.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with the ways of the Eternal as they are revealed in the\r\nphysical universe certainly tends to keep a man sane and sober and\r\nsafeguards him against the vagaries and half-truths which our creeds\r\nand indoor artificial lives tend to breed. Shut away from Nature, or\r\nonly studying her through religious fears and superstitions, what a\r\nmess a large body of mankind in all ages have made of it! Think of\r\nthe obsession of the speedy \"end of the world\" which has so often\r\ntaken possession of whole communities, as if a world that has been\r\nan eternity in forming could end in a day, or on the striking of the\r\nclock! It is not many years since a college professor published a\r\nbook figuring out, from some old historical documents and\r\npredictions, just the year in which the great mundane show would\r\nbreak up. When I was a small boy at school in the early forties,\r\nduring the Millerite excitement about the approaching end of all\r\nmundane things, I remember, on the day when the momentous event was\r\nexpected to take place, how the larger school-girls were thrown into\r\na great state of alarm and agitation by a thundercloud that let down\r\na curtain of rain, blotting out the mountain on the opposite side of\r\nthe valley. \"There it comes!\" they said, and their tears flowed\r\ncopiously. I remember that I did not share their fears, but watched\r\nthe cloud, curious as to what the end of the world would be like. I\r\ncannot brag, as Thoreau did, when he said he would not go around the\r\ncorner to see the world blow up. I am quite sure my curiosity would\r\nget the better of me and that I should go, even at this late day. Or\r\nthink of the more harmless obsession of many good people about the\r\nsecond coming of Christ, or about the resurrection of the physical\r\nbody when the last trumpet shall sound. A little natural knowledge\r\nought to be fatal to all such notions. Natural knowledge shows us\r\nhow transient and insignificant we are, and how vast and everlasting\r\nthe world is, which was aeons before we were, and will be other\r\naeons after we are gone, yea, after the whole race of man is gone.\r\nNatural knowledge takes the conceit out of us, and is the sure\r\nantidote to all our petty anthropomorphic views of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI was struck by this passage in one of the recently published\r\nletters of Saint-Gaudens: \"The principal thought in my life is that\r\nwe are on a planet going no one knows where, probably to something\r\nhigher (on the Darwinian principle of evolution); that, whatever it\r\nis, the passage is terribly sad and tragic, and to bear up at times\r\nagainst what seems to be the Great Power that is over us, the\r\npractice of love, charity, and courage are the great things.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Great Power\" that is over us does seem unmindful of us as\r\nindividuals, if it does not seem positively against us, as\r\nSaint-Gaudens seemed to think it was.\r\n\r\nSurely the ways of the Eternal are not as our ways. Our standards of\r\nprudence, of economy, of usefulness, of waste, of delay, of\r\nfailure--how far off they seem from the scale upon which the\r\nuniverse is managed or deports itself! If the earth should be blown\r\nto pieces to-day, and all life instantly blotted out, would it not\r\nbe just like what we know of the cosmic prodigality and\r\nindifference? Such appalling disregard of all human motives and ends\r\nbewilders us.\r\n\r\nOf all the planets of our system probably only two or three are in a\r\ncondition to sustain life. Mercury, the youngest of them all, is\r\ndoubtless a dead world, with absolute zero on one side and a furnace\r\ntemperature on the other. But what matters it? Whose loss or gain is\r\nit? Life seems only an incident in the universe, evidently not an\r\nend. It appears or it does not appear, and who shall say yea or nay?\r\nThe asteroids at one time no doubt formed a planet between Mars and\r\nJupiter. Some force which no adjective can describe or qualify blew\r\nit into fragments, and there, in its stead, is this swarm of huge\r\nrocks making their useless rounds in the light of the sun forever\r\nand ever. What matters it to the prodigal All? Bodies larger than\r\nour sun collide in the depths of space before our eyes with results\r\nso terrific that words cannot even hint them. The last of these\r\ncollisions--of this \"wreck of matter and crush of worlds\"--reported\r\nitself to our planet in February, 1901, when a star of the twelfth\r\nmagnitude suddenly blazed out as a star of the first magnitude and\r\nthen slowly faded. It was the grand finale of the independent\r\nexistence of two enormous celestial bodies. They apparently ended in\r\ndust that whirled away in the vast abyss of siderial space, blown by\r\nthe winds upon which suns and systems drift as autumn leaves. It\r\nwould be quite in keeping with the observed ways of the Eternal, if\r\nthese bodies had had worlds in their train, teeming with life, which\r\nmet the same fate as the central colliding bodies.\r\n\r\nDoes not force as we know it in this world go its own way with the\r\nsame disregard of the precious thing we call life? Such long and\r\npatient preparations for it,--apparently the whole stellar system in\r\nlabor pains to bring it forth,--and yet held so cheaply and\r\nindifferently in the end! The small insect that just now alighted in\r\nfront of my jack-plane as I was dressing a timber, and was reduced\r\nto a faint yellow stain upon the wood, is typical of the fate of man\r\nbefore the unregarding and unswerving terrestrial and celestial\r\nforces. The great wheels go round just the same whether they are\r\ncrushing the man or crushing the corn for his bread. It is all one\r\nto the Eternal. Flood, fire, wind, gravity, are for us or against us\r\nindifferently. And yet the earth is here, garlanded with the seasons\r\nand riding in the celestial currents like a ship in calm summer\r\nseas, and man is here with all things under his feet. All is well in\r\nour corner of the universe. The great mill has made meal of our\r\ngrist and not of the miller. We have taken our chances and have won.\r\nMore has been for us than against us. During the little segment of\r\ntime that man has been upon the earth, only one great calamity that\r\nmight be called cosmical has befallen it. The ice age of one or two\r\nhundred thousand years was such a calamity. But man survived it. The\r\nspring came again, and life, the traveler, picked itself up and made\r\na new start. But if he had not survived it, if nothing had survived\r\nit, the great procession would have gone on just the same; the gods\r\nwould have been just as well pleased.\r\n\r\nThe battle is to the strong, the race is to the fleet. This is the\r\norder of nature. No matter for the rest, for the weak, the slow, the\r\nunlucky, so that the fight is won, so that the race of man\r\ncontinues. You and I may fail and fall before our time; the end may\r\nbe a tragedy or a comedy. What matters it? Only some one must\r\nsucceed, will succeed.\r\n\r\nWe are here, I say, because, in the conflict of forces, the\r\ninfluences that made for life have been in the ascendant. This\r\nconflict of forces has been a part of the process of our\r\ndevelopment. We have been ground out as between an upper and a\r\nnether millstone, but we have squeezed through, we have actually\r\narrived, and are all the better for the grinding--all those who have\r\nsurvived. But, alas for those whose lives went out in the crush!\r\nMaybe they often broke the force of the blow for us.\r\n\r\nNature is not benevolent; Nature is just, gives pound for pound,\r\nmeasure for measure, makes no exceptions, never tempers her decrees\r\nwith mercy, or winks at any infringement of her laws. And in the end\r\nis not this best? Could the universe be run as a charity or a\r\nbenevolent institution, or as a poor-house of the most approved\r\npattern? Without this merciless justice, this irrefragable law,\r\nwhere should we have brought up long ago? It is a hard gospel; but\r\nrocks are hard too, yet they form the foundations of the hills.\r\n\r\nMan introduces benevolence, mercy, altruism, into the world, and he\r\npays the price in his added burdens; and he reaps his reward in the\r\nvast social and civic organizations that were impossible without\r\nthese things.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that the life of man upon this planet will end, as\r\nall other forms of life will end. But the potential man will\r\ncontinue and does continue on other spheres. One cannot think of one\r\npart of the universe as producing man, and no other part as capable\r\nof it. The universe is all of a piece so far as its material\r\nconstituents are concerned; that we know. Can there be any doubt\r\nthat it is all of a piece so far as its invisible and intangible\r\nforces and capabilities are concerned? Can we believe that the earth\r\nis an alien and a stranger in the universe? that it has no near kin?\r\nthat there is no tie of blood, so to speak, between it and the other\r\nplanets and systems? Are the planets not all of one family, sitting\r\naround the same central source of warmth and life? And is not our\r\nsystem a member of a still larger family or tribe, and it of a still\r\nlarger, all bound together by ties of consanguinity? Size is\r\nnothing, space is nothing. The worlds are only red corpuscles in the\r\narteries of the infinite. If man has not yet appeared on the other\r\nplanets, he will in time appear, and when he has disappeared from\r\nthis globe, he will still continue elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI do not say that he is the end and aim of creation; it would be\r\nlogical, I think, to expect a still higher form. Man has been man\r\nbut a little while comparatively, less than one hour of the twenty-\r\nfour of the vast geologic day; a few hours more and he will be gone;\r\nless than another geologic day like the past, and no doubt all life\r\nfrom the earth will be gone. What then? The game will be played over\r\nand over again in other worlds, without approaching any nearer the\r\nfinal end than we are now. There is no final end, as there was no\r\nabsolute beginning, and can be none with the infinite.\r\n\r\nTHE END",
