The barque had gone far out of her true course, and no one on\r\nboard knew where we were. The masts lay in splints on the deck, a leak\r\nin the side of the ship let more in than the crew could pump out, and\r\neach one felt that ere long he would find a grave in the deep sea, which\r\nsent its spray from side to side of what was now but a mere hulk.\r\n\r\n\"Come, boys,\" said I to my four sons, who were with me, \"God can save us\r\nif it please Him so to do; but, if this is to be our last hour, let us\r\nbow to His will--we shall at least go down side by side.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear wife could not hide the tears that fell down her cheeks as I\r\nthus spoke to my sons, but she was calm, and knelt down to pray, while\r\nthe boys clung round her as if they thought she could help them.\r\n\r\nJust then we heard a cry of \"Land! land!\" felt a shock, and it was clear\r\nthat we had struck on a rock, for we heard a loud cry from one of the\r\nmen, \"We are lost! Launch the boat; try for your lives!\"\r\n\r\nI went at once on deck, and found that all the boats had been let down,\r\nand that the last of the crew had just left the ship. I cried out for\r\nthe men to come back and take us with them, but it was in vain.\r\n\r\nI then thought that our last chance was gone. Still, as I felt the ship\r\ndid not sink, I went to the stern, and found, to my joy, that she was\r\nheld up by a piece of rock on each side, and made fast like a wedge. At\r\nthe same time I saw some trace of land, which lay to the south, and this\r\nmade me go back with some hope that we had still a faint chance.\r\n\r\n As soon as I got down stairs I took my wife by the hand, and said, \"Be\r\nof good cheer, we are at least safe for some time, and if the wind\r\nshould veer round, we may yet reach the land that lies but a short way\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nI said this to calm the fears of my wife and sons, and it did so far\r\nmore than I had a right to hope.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now take some food,\" said my wife. \"We are sure to need it, for\r\nthis will no doubt be a night to try our strength.\"\r\n\r\nMy wife got some food for her boys, which we were glad to see them eat,\r\npoor as it was; but we could not share their meal. Three out of the four\r\nwere put to bed in their berths, and soon went to sleep; but Fritz, who\r\nwas our first child, would not leave us. He said, like a good son, that\r\nhe would try to be of some use, and think what could be done.\r\n\r\n\"If we could but find some cork,\" said Fritz to me in a low tone, \"we\r\nmight make floats. You and I will not need them, for we can swim, but\r\nthe rest will want some such means to keep them up.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good thought,\" said I. \"Let us try to find what things there are in\r\nthe ship that we can thus make use of.\"\r\n\r\nWe soon found some casks and ropes, and with these we made a kind of\r\nfloat for each of the three boys, and then my wife made one for her own\r\nuse. This done, we got some knives, string, and such things as we could\r\nmake fast to our belts. We did not fail to look for and find a flint and\r\nsteel, and the box in which the burnt rags were kept, for these were at\r\nthat time in use as the means to strike a light.\r\n\r\nFritz, who was now well-nigh worn out, lay down on his bed and slept\r\nlike the rest. As for me and my poor wife, we kept watch, each in fear\r\nlest the next wave should lift the ship off the rock and break it up.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you how glad we were when we saw the first gleam of\r\nlight. At dawn the wind did not blow so strong, the sky was clear of\r\nclouds, and we saw the sun rise, and with it rose our hopes. I soon had\r\nmy wife and sons on deck.\r\n\r\n\"Where are the men?\" said they. \"How can we steer the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear boys,\" said I, \"He who has kept us safe till now will still aid\r\nus. Let all hands set to work, and leave the rest to God.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words we all went to work with a will. My wife went to feed the\r\nlive stock; Fritz set off in search of arms, and the means to make use\r\nof them; and Ernest made his way to the tool chest. Jack ran to pick up\r\nwhat he could find, but as he got to one of the doors he gave it a push,\r\nand two huge dogs sprang out and leaped at him. He thought at first that\r\nthey would bite him, but he soon found that they meant him no harm, and\r\none of them let him get on his back and ride up to me as I came from the\r\nhold of the ship.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys had done their search, and the spoil was brought on deck,\r\nwe thought we had found all that we should need. \"As for me,\" said my\r\nwife, \"I have brought good news, for I find we have still on board a\r\ncow, an ass, two goats, six sheep, a ram, a pig, and a sow, and I have\r\nfound food for them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that you bring will be of use,\" said I; \"but I fear that Jack's\r\ndogs will do us more harm than good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Jack, \"for they can help us to hunt when we get to\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Jack. And now let us see what we can do that will aid us to\r\nget there.\"\r\n\r\nWe then took the casks that we had found, and Ernest and I soon cut them\r\nin half. With these tubs we made a kind of raft, though it was no slight\r\ntask. The tubs, in fact, were a fleet of eight small round boats, made\r\nso fast to some planks that no one of them could float from the rest.\r\nThe next thing to be done was to launch the raft. This we at length did,\r\nand when the boys saw it slide down the side of the ship and float on\r\nthe sea, they gave a loud shout, and each one tried who should be the\r\nfirst to get on it. I made it fast to the ship, and there left it.\r\n\r\nI then told my wife to change her dress for that of one of the crew\r\nwhich she had found, as her skirts would have got in her way when she\r\nhad to climb. She did not at first like this, but did so as soon as she\r\nsaw the truth of what I told her.\r\n\r\nAt last, when all was done, we went to bed, and slept as sound as if we\r\nhad been on land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWE were all up at the break of day, and knelt down to thank God that He\r\nhad kept us from harm through the night.\r\n\r\nWe then put all the things on the raft, and ten live hens and two cocks\r\nwere put in one of the tubs. Some ducks and geese we let go, in the hope\r\nthat they would swim to the shore; and a pair of doves were set free, as\r\nthey could fly to the land.\r\n\r\nThere was a place in the raft for each of us. In the first tub sat my\r\nwife; in the next Frank, who was eight years old; in the third Fritz,\r\nnot quite twice the age of Frank; in the fourth were the fowls, and some\r\nold sails that would make us a tent; the fifth was full of good things\r\nin the way of food; in the sixth stood Jack, a bold lad, ten years old;\r\nin the next Ernest, twelve years of age, well taught, but too fond of\r\nself, and less fond of work than the rest; while I sat in the eighth, to\r\nguide the raft that was to save all that was dear to me in the world.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dogs (Bill and Turk by name) saw us push off from the\r\nship they leaped in the sea, swam near the raft, and kept well up with\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe sea was calm; so that we felt quite safe. We made good use of the\r\noars, and the raft bore its freight straight to the land; but as we drew\r\nnear to the shore the sight of the bare rocks led us to think that we\r\nmight still be in need of food and drink when that which we had was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nAs we got near, the coast lost its bare look, and we were glad to see\r\nthat there was no lack of trees. We soon found a bay, to which the ducks\r\nand geese had found their way, and here we saw a place where we could\r\nland.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had made the raft fast with a strong rope, we took out all\r\nour wealth, and made a tent with the old sail cloth we had brought with\r\nus, and stuck a pole in the ground to keep it up. This done, I sent\r\nthe boys to get some moss and dry grass to make our beds with. With the\r\nflint and steel we soon set fire to some dry twigs, and my wife made a\r\npot of soup with what she had brought from the ship.\r\n\r\nFritz, who had charge of the guns, chose one, and took a stroll by the\r\nside of a stream, while Jack went in search of shell fish, which he\r\nthought he might find on the rocks. My share of the work was to save two\r\nlarge casks which were near the shore. While I was up to my knees in the\r\nsea I heard a shrill cry, which I knew to come from Jack. I got out at\r\nonce, took up an axe, and ran to his help. I found him with his legs in\r\na rock pool, where a large crab held him by his toes. It soon made off\r\nas I came near; but I struck at it with the axe, and brought it out of\r\nthe pool. Jack then took it up, though it gave him a pinch or two ere he\r\nfound out how to hold it, and ran off in high glee to show what he had\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back to the tent, I found that Ernest had brought us news\r\nthat he had seen salt in the chinks of the rocks, and that shell fish\r\nwere not scarce.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my boy, if you are sure you saw them, I will ask you to go back\r\nfor some. We must each do some work for the good of all.\"\r\n\r\nHe went, and soon found the salt, left by the sea on the rocks, which\r\nthe sun had made quite dry. There was some sand with it, but my wife did\r\nnot take long to find a way to cure that. She had been to a fresh stream\r\nwith a large jug; from this I saw her pour some on the salt, strain it\r\nthrough a cloth, and let it drip in a cup, so that all the sand was left\r\non the cloth.\r\n\r\nWhen the soup was made hot we had each a taste, and all said that it was\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"Be not in too great haste,\" said my wife, \"we must wait for Fritz; but\r\nif he were here, I do not see how we are to take our soup, for we have\r\nno plates nor spoons.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we had but some large nuts,\" said Ernest, \"we might cut them in\r\nhalf, and they would make good bowls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite true,\" said I; \"but as there are none, we may as well wish for\r\ndelf bowls and real spoons at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I have it,\" quoth Ernest. \"Let us use the shells I saw on the\r\nshore.\"\r\n\r\nOff ran Jack to the shore, with Ernest at his heels, and back they both\r\ncame with large and small shells for us all.\r\n\r\nJust then Fritz came in, with a look of gloom on his face, which I could\r\nsee was a sham.\r\n\r\n\"You do not mean to tell me you have come back with nought?\" said I, as\r\nhe put out his hands as if to prove that such was the case. But Jack,\r\nwho had been round him, cried out, \"No, no! he's got a pig!--such a fine\r\none. Tell us where you found it.\"\r\n\r\nFritz now brought forth his prize. When I saw it, I knew, from what\r\nI had read, that it was not a pig, but a swift beast, known in these\r\nparts, that lives on fruit and nuts, and hides in the earth. (*The\r\nAgouti.)\r\n\r\n\"I like the place much more than I do this spot,\" said he. \"The shore\r\nlies low, and there are planks, casks, chests, and all sorts of things,\r\nthat the sea has thrown up. Why not leave this place at once, and go\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a time for all things,\" said I. \"We must at least rest here\r\nfor one night.\"\r\n\r\nWe all sat down to take our soup with the shell spoons. Ernest took from\r\nhis coat a large shell, which he had hid till now, put it in the soup,\r\nand then set it down to cool.\r\n\r\n\"You do not show want of thought,\" said I to him. \"But I am not glad to\r\nsee that you think so of your-self, and do so much for your own ease,\r\nwhen all the rest do so much for yours. Now, that shell full of soup you\r\nmust give to our two dogs. We can all dip our small shells in the pot,\r\nand you must do as we do.\"\r\n\r\nI knew he felt hurt at this, but he gave it to the dogs at once, and\r\nthey soon made quick work of their share of the soup.\r\n\r\nThe sun was low when our meal came to an end. The fowls came round us to\r\npick up the stray crumbs we had let fall, and my wife took out her bag\r\nof grain and fed the cocks and hens, and sent them to roost on the top\r\nof our tent.\r\n\r\nWe took care to load our fire-arms, in case we might need them in the\r\nnight; sang a hymn of praise to God, and then left our fate in His\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I heard the cock crow, and saw by the light that it was break\r\nof day, I got out of bed and spoke to my wife as to what we should do\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n\"First,\" said I, \"Fritz and I will make a tour of the coast and try to\r\nfind some of the men who left the ship, for if they are here they may be\r\nin want.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Fritz, who had heard me from his bed, \"why should we search\r\nfor those who left us to die on the wreck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will tell you,\" said I. \"First, we should do to them as we\r\nwould wish them to do to us, not as they have done; next, we know that\r\nthey took no food with them, and we should not leave them to starve;\r\nand last, it may be that they can help us, though now they stand more in\r\nneed of our aid.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys were soon up, and we all sat down to a good meal. That done,\r\nFritz and I got our guns. I put a pair of small arms in his belt, gave\r\nhim a game bag, and told him to take an axe. I took some food for us\r\nboth, and a full flask, out of which we could drink if we should stray\r\nfar from a stream.\r\n\r\nWhen we took our leave, my wife and the three boys were in tears. The\r\ndog Bill we left to guard the tent, but Turk went with us, and ran by\r\nour side.\r\n\r\nWe soon got to the banks of a stream; but then had to make our way down\r\nits course. It took us some time to reach the sea shore. There was not a\r\nboat to be seen, or any sign that the ship's crew had found the land. We\r\nleft the shore, and went through a wood full of tall trees. Here Fritz\r\nstruck some hard thing on the ground with his foot, which we found to be\r\na CO-COA NUT. He gave it a blow with his axe, and broke the shell, and\r\nwe both sat down to rest, and eat the nut.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the wood we came to a plain which gave us a clear view\r\nof the place. Fritz, who was on the look out, ran off with Turk to some\r\nstrange trees that he saw on the right.\r\n\r\nWhen I got up to him, it gave me no small joy to find that it was a\r\ngourd tree.\r\n\r\n\"Try,\" said I, \"if you can get hold of one of those queer lumps that\r\ngrow on it.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he brought one down, and we had a look at it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, of this,\" said I, \"we can make a plate, a dish, or a flask. Wild\r\nmen set great store by its shell, which they use to hold their food and\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nWe then set to work to make plates of the gourds. When we had made some\r\neight or ten bowls, and some flat ones for plates, we laid them out in\r\nthe sun to dry, and then went on our way.\r\n\r\nWe could see, not far off, a grove of fine palm trees, but to reach them\r\nwe should have to pass through reeds and long grass. I knew this was\r\njust the place to find snakes, so we each cut a cane, that we might beat\r\nthem off should we meet with any. As I took hold of my staff, I felt a\r\ngum or juice ooze out of the end. I put my tongue to it, and found it of\r\na sweet taste. This led me to suck the reed, and I then knew that we had\r\nmet with the SUG-AR CANE. By this time Fritz had done the same, for I\r\ncould see that he held his cane to his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Do not suck too much of it,\" said I, \"or it will make you ill; but let\r\nus cut some of the best and take them back with us, for those at home\r\nwill prize so great a treat.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not take us long to reach the place where the palms grew, and\r\nthen we sat down in the shade to eat the food we had brought with us.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see those nuts at the top of the trees, Fritz?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I do; but they are far too high to reach. Look, look!\" he\r\ncried, \"there are some MON-KEYS; let me have a shot at them.\" \"Do not\r\ndo that,\" I said, and held his arm; \"it will do us no good to kill them,\r\nand I think I can make use of them.\" With that I threw some stones up at\r\nthe tree where they were, though they had got safe out of my reach. They\r\nthen made a loud noise, took hold of the nuts that were near, and flung\r\nthem straight at us. The trick made Fritz laugh, who soon had hard work\r\nto pick up the nuts that were thrown at him.\r\n\r\nWe broke some of the nuts, and put the juice of the canes in the thick\r\nwhite cream which forms close to the shell; and this made us a dish that\r\nFritz said was fit for a king.\r\n\r\nFritz and I then made fast some nuts to a string, which I tied round my\r\nwaist, while he took up his canes, and we both set off on our road home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON our way back we took up the gourd bowls and plates, which we found\r\nquite dry and hard as bone, and put them in our bags. We had scarce got\r\nthrough the wood, when Turk made a dart in front of us, and we saw a\r\ntroop of apes rush out of the way. But he gave a leap and brought down\r\none that could not climb so fast as the rest, for she had a young one\r\nin her arms. Turk made short work of the poor thing, for ere Fritz could\r\ncall the dog off, the ape was dead. The young one, as soon as it saw\r\nFritz, sprang on his back, put its paws in his curls, and would not let\r\ngo. I at length got the ape from Fritz's back, and took it up in my arms\r\nlike a child. We found that it was too young to seek its own food, and,\r\nas Fritz said he should like to take it home, we put it on Turk's back.\r\nTurk did not at first like this, but we soon got him to bear the ape,\r\nwhich held so tight by the hair on the dog's neck that it could not well\r\nfall off. Fritz then led Turk with a string, that he might not stray out\r\nof sight, or throw off his charge, which I think he would have done had\r\nwe not been on the watch.\r\n\r\nIt did not take us long to reach the bank of the stream near to our\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nI need not tell you how glad my wife and sons were to see us safe back,\r\nor with what joy the boys took the \"real live ape\" out of Fritz's arms.\r\n\r\nAt length, when they got more staid, I told them that we had brought\r\nthem all sorts of good things, but that we had not met with any of the\r\nmen of whom we went in search. \"God's will be done,\" said my wife, \"let\r\nus thank Him that you have come back safe to us. This day to me has been\r\nan age; but put down your loads, for we must now go in and hear what you\r\nhave to tell.\"\r\n\r\nFritz and I then told them, by turns, where we found the things we\r\nbrought with us, how we made and dried the plates and bowls, cut the\r\ncanes, and caught the ape in the wood. Our tales had not come to an end\r\nwhen we were told that it was time to sup. Ernest had shot a wild goose,\r\nand some fish had been caught in the stream. With these, and the Dutch\r\ncheese that we brought from the ship, we made a good meal; but the boys\r\nwould not rest till we broke some of the nuts, from which they drank the\r\nmilk, made sweet with the juice of the canes. I must tell you that we\r\nate our food in great state from our gourd rind plates, which my wife\r\nsaid she should prize more than if they were made of pure gold.\r\n\r\nThat night the ape went to bed with Jack and Fritz, and we all slept in\r\npeace till the cocks on the roof of the tent woke us up.\r\n\r\nNext day Fritz and I went back to the wreck to save the live stock, and\r\nget what else we had left that might be of use to us. We found it no\r\nlight task, for we had to make floats for the cow, the ass, the sheep,\r\nand the goats, throw them in the sea, and tie them with ropes to our\r\nraft. We put on board the raft a vast deal of food that had not been\r\nspoiled by the sea, though the waves had made a breach in the sides of\r\nthe wreck. We then put to sea with our train of live stock made fast to\r\nthe stern.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far when I heard a loud cry of fear from Fritz, \"We are\r\nlost! We are lost! See what a great shark is on its way to us!\"\r\n\r\nThough pale with fright, he took aim with his gun, and shot the fish in\r\nthe head. It sank at once, but left a track of blood in the sea, which I\r\nknew to be a sign that we were once more safe. We then got to land, and\r\nmade fast our freight to the shore. Ere we had done this our friends\r\ncame to give us what help they could to get the beasts out of the\r\nstream, and take them up to the tent. The poor things were well nigh\r\nworn out; but we took good care of them, and put them to rest on some\r\ndry grass that my wife had laid out for them.\r\n\r\nThat night we did not sup on the ground. My wife had spread a cloth on\r\nthe top of a cask, and we each sat on a tub. With the knives and forks\r\nthat we had found in the ship we ate a dish of hot ham and eggs, nor did\r\nwe fail to test the wine that I had brought with me in a small cask from\r\nthe wreck.\r\n\r\nEre bed-time my wife had told me that while I was at the wreck she had\r\ngone in search of some place in which we could build a house.\r\n\r\n\"And did you find one, my dear?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" said she. \"We can take you to a great tree that will serve us\r\nwell, if we can but get across the stream with our goods.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would you have us roost, like fowls, in a tree? How do you think we\r\ncould get up to our perch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there not a large lime tree in our town in which they built a ball\r\nroom, with stairs up the trunk?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure there was,\" said I; \"and if we can not build in it, we can\r\nat least make use of its shade, and dwell in a hut on the roots.\"\r\n\r\nErnest said that he took a string, and found that it was twelve yards\r\nround. This led me to think that my wife's scheme was by no means a bad\r\none, and that I would have a look at the tree the next day.\r\n\r\nWhen I had heard all they had to tell, we knelt down to pray, and then\r\nsought a good night's rest, which the toils of the day made us much in\r\nneed of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHEN I rose from my bed the next day, I said to my wife: \"Does it not\r\nseem, my dear, as if God had led us to this place, and that we should do\r\nwrong to leave it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say may be quite true, so far as it goes,\" she said; \"but I\r\nmust tell you that the mid-day heat is more than we can bear, and that\r\nif we stay here we may have to keep watch at night, for there are, no\r\ndoubt, wild beasts of some kind that will find us out; and we should\r\nnot trust too much to our dogs, who may lose their lives in a fight with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you are right,\" said I; \"but I do not yet see how we can\r\ncross the stream. We shall first have to build a bridge.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys were now all out of their beds; and while my wife went to milk\r\nthe cow and cook some food, I made my plans known to them. They were all\r\nglad when they heard that we were to leave, and each said he, would help\r\nto build the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done was to find some strong planks; and Fritz,\r\nErnest, and I went down to the shore, and got in the boat, which the\r\ntide took down to the bay.\r\n\r\nOn a piece of land which lay to the left we could see some large dark\r\nthing, round which flew a flock of sea gulls. We put up a sail and\r\ncaught a gust of wind which had sprung up, and this soon brought the\r\nboat to the spot. We made no noise, but crept up the shore step by step,\r\nand we got so near that Ernest brought down some of the birds with a\r\nstick. Fritz was the first to find out that what the sea gulls had just\r\nleft was the huge fish he had shot in the sea. We cut off some rough\r\nskin, which we thought might serve for files, and then went back to the\r\nboat. I took a glance at the shore ere I got in, and to my great joy saw\r\nsome of the planks and spars from the wreck lay on the ground not far\r\noff. Our next care was to bind these so as to make a raft, which we tied\r\nto the stern of the boat, and then, by the use of our oars, soon made\r\nour way up the stream to the place where the bridge was to be built. Our\r\nyoung friends were glad to see us back so soon, and ran to meet us; Jack\r\nhad a cloth in his hand, in which was a store of cray fish and crabs\r\njust caught in some of the nooks of a rock up the stream.\r\n\r\n\"Do not fail to give God thanks,\" said I, \"that our lot has been cast\r\nwhere we can pick up more food than we can eat.\"\r\n\r\nIt would take a long time to tell how we brought all the wood up to the\r\nspot, built piers of stone in the stream, and put the planks one by one\r\nin the place; it was late at night when we left off work, and once more\r\nsought our tent.\r\n\r\nThe next day we saw the sun rise, and took our first meal in haste, for\r\nwe knew we should have a long day's toil. All the stores that we could\r\nnot take with us were laid by in the tent, the door of which was made\r\nsafe by a row of casks, that we put round it. My wife and Fritz soon led\r\nthe way; the cow went next; then the ass, with Frank on its back. Jack\r\nled the goats, and on the back of one of them sat the ape. Ernest took\r\ncharge of the sheep, and I brought up the rear as chief guard. We took\r\ncare to cross the bridge one at a time, and found it bore our weight\r\nwell; but once or twice we thought the cow would step in the stream, or\r\nfall off the boards, when she went to the sides to drink.\r\n\r\nJust as we had left the bridge, Jack cried out, \"Be quick! here is a\r\nstrange beast with quills as long as my arm.\" The dogs ran, and I with\r\nthem, and found a large POR-CU-PINE, in the grass. It made a loud noise,\r\nand shot out its quills at the dogs, and made them bleed. At this Jack\r\nshot at the beast, which fell dead on the spot. My wife's first thought\r\nwas to dress the wounds made by the quills, which had stuck in the\r\nnose of one of the dogs, while the boys made haste to pluck some of the\r\nquills from the skin of their strange prize.\r\n\r\nAt last our march came to an end, and I saw for the first time the great\r\ntrees that my wife had told me of. They were of vast size, and were, I\r\nthought, fig trees. \"If we can but fix our tent up there,\" I said, \"we\r\nshall have no cause to dread, for no wild beasts can reach us.\" We sent\r\nFrank off to find sticks, with which to make a fire, and my wife made\r\nsome soup of the flesh of the beast we had slain, though we did not like\r\nit so well as we did the ham and cheese we brought with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE meal at an end, my first thought was to make some steps by means of\r\nwhich we could reach the first strong branch of the tree. Ernest and I\r\nwent in search of some thick canes that grew in the sands hard by. These\r\nwe cut down, bound them to four long poles, and thus made a pair of\r\nsteps that would, we thought, reach far up the trunk.\r\n\r\nOn our way back from the sands, one of the dogs made a dart at a clump\r\nof reeds, and a troop of large birds rose on the wing with a loud noise.\r\nFritz let fly at them, and brought down two at a shot. One of them fell\r\nquite dead, but its mate, though hurt in the wing, made use of its long\r\nlegs so well that it would have got off if Bill had not held it. The joy\r\nof Fritz, to have caught such a strange bird, was so great that he would\r\nhave us at once bind it by the neck and take it back with us. \"Look,\"\r\nsaid Ernest, \"what fine plumes he has, and you see he has web feet like\r\na goose, and has long legs like a stork: thus he can run on land as fast\r\nas he can swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"and he can fly with more speed through the air, for\r\nthese birds have great strength in their wings. In fact, few birds have\r\nsuch means of flight as the FLA-MIN-GO.\"\r\n\r\nMy wife thought the great bird might need more food than we could spare.\r\nI told her that it would feed on small fish and worms, and not rob our\r\ngeese of their grain. I then tied him to a stake near the stream; and\r\nin a few days we were glad to find that he knew us, and would come at a\r\ncall, like a tame bird.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat on the grass with my sons, late in the day, I thought I\r\nwould try to make a bow and thus save our shot. This I did with a long\r\ncane and a piece of string, and then made a dart with a sharp point,\r\nwhich I shot off and found it would go straight. The branch of the tree\r\non which we were to fix our hut was so high that our steps would not\r\nnear reach it. I tied some strong thread to the dart, and shot it over\r\nthe branch; then tied a piece of rope to the end of the thread, and drew\r\nthat up, and at last made a long row of cane steps, with a rope at each\r\nside, which we drew up to the first strong branch. The boys were now\r\nall in haste to climb the tree, but I chose that Jack, who was light of\r\nbuild and sure of foot, should go up first and try the strength of our\r\nwork. Fritz went up next with some nails, and made the ropes fast to the\r\ntree, while I drove stakes in the ground to keep them firm at the foot.\r\nIt was now time for me to mount, and up I went with an axe to lop off\r\nthe twigs and smooth the bough that was to form the ground of our new\r\nhouse. I sent the boys down out of my way, and kept hard at work till it\r\nwas late, for the sky was clear, and the moon lent me her beams of light\r\nto see by.\r\n\r\nWhen I came down my wife spread a good meal on the ground, which we ate\r\nas best we could, and then made our beds of dry moss, round which we put\r\nheaps of twigs. These we set light to, as watch fires to keep off wild\r\nbeasts and snakes. The toils of the day had made the boys tired, and\r\nthey were soon in a sound sleep, but my wife and I took it in turns to\r\nwatch through the whole night.\r\n\r\nWe were all out of bed as soon as light was in the sky, and set to work\r\nto hoist up the planks that were to form the floor of our hut. These we\r\nlaid down on the branch, with their ends made fast to a cross piece of\r\nwood that we had to fix to the trunk of the tree. Our nails were long,\r\nand we drove each one of them home, so that we had no cause to fear\r\nthe strength of our work. By the time we had done this the day was far\r\nspent, and we were all glad to lay by our tools and rest our limbs. That\r\nnight we lit our fires round the tree, tied the dogs to the roots, and\r\nwent up to sleep out of harm's way for the first time since we left the\r\nship. When the steps were drawn up we all felt that we were now safe at\r\nlast, and that we had brought the toils of the day to a good end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nWE did not wake next day till the sun shone in upon us. I told my wife\r\nand sons that as it was the Lord's day we would do no work. Our beasts\r\nand birds had first to be fed. This was done by my wife, who then\r\nbrought us some hot milk, and made us sit down on the grass and take it.\r\nWhen our meal was done, I got on a log in front of my sons, and we all\r\nsang a psalm we knew by heart. Then I sought to teach them and spoke to\r\nthem thus:\r\n\r\n\"There was once on a time a Great King, who had two vast realms, the\r\nLand of Light and Truth, and the Land of Night and Sloth. Those who\r\ndwelt in the first were full of life and joy. The King held his court at\r\nthe Place of Rest where all was bright.\r\n\r\n\"This King had a land, not far off, where those for whom he had so much\r\nlove should dwell ere they went one by one to the Place of Rest. This\r\nland was the Home of Earth. He gave to his Son the right to rule the\r\nhost that dwelt in the Home of Earth, and set forth to think what they\r\nwere to do, and all the ills that would come to them if they did not do\r\nas they were bid.\r\n\r\n\"At first they were all glad to hear the way in which they were to live,\r\nand the terms on which they could reach the Land of Light and Truth. Sad\r\nto tell, they soon broke the King's laws, and paid no heed to what they\r\nknew to be his will. Still there were a few who did as they had been\r\ntaught, and dwelt in peace, in the hope that they would please the King\r\nand at last reach the place where he held his court.\r\n\r\n\"From time to time ships came to the Home of Earth, and at last a great\r\nship was sent, the name of which was The Grave, which bore the flag of\r\nDeath. To the good it was a sign of hope, but the bad were thrown by the\r\nsight of it into a state of gloom. These ships were not seen till they\r\ncame close to the shore, and then the crew were sent forth to find those\r\nwhom they were told to seize. Some went back with them full of joy,\r\nbut most were seen to weep and mourn their fate. So soon as they were\r\nbrought in sight of the Great King, the Prince took those who had done\r\nwell, and put a white robe on them; but those who went their own way\r\nwhen on the Home of Earth, he sent down to toil in deep, dark mines till\r\ntime shall be no more.\"\r\n\r\nWhen my sons had heard my tale to the end they all knew what it meant;\r\nI then drew from them their views of what they ought to do to please and\r\nserve the Great King. We then sang a hymn; and my wife drew from her bag\r\nthe BIBLE, which I gave to one of the boys, who read from it in a clear,\r\nloud voice. When this was brought to a close, we all knelt down on the\r\ngrass to pray, and to ask God to bless the means we took to learn His\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nWe did no work that day, but took a long stroll up the banks of the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe next day Ernest and Jack tried their skill with the bow, and brought\r\ndown some small birds that came to the great tree in quest of figs. I\r\ngave them leave to kill what they could; for I knew if put in casks made\r\nair tight with grease, they would keep for a time, and might prove a\r\nboon, if our stock of food should get low.\r\n\r\nWhen we sat down to dine, the thought struck me that it would be well to\r\ngive some name to each part of the land that was known to us. This was\r\nat first the source of some fun, for Fritz said we should call the bay\r\nwhere we had found the shell spoons by the name of Spoon Bay; but Jack,\r\nwho still had a mark on his toe where the crab gave him a pinch, thought\r\nwe ought to term it Crab Bay.\r\n\r\n\"If you will let me give it a name,\" said my wife, \"I should wish to\r\nknow it by some term that will make us bear in mind how good God was to\r\nlead our raft there, and I don't think Safe Bay will be a bad name for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"So let it be,\" said I; and from that time Safe Bay had a name. \"What\r\nshall be the name of the spot where we spent our first night on shore?\r\nYou shall give that its name,\" said I to Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"Let us call it Tent House.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said I. \"And now for the spot at the mouth of Safe Bay,\r\nwhere we found our planks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharp Point,\" said Ernest. The place from which Fritz and I sought for\r\na trace of out ship mates was to be known as No Man's Cape. Then we had\r\nthe Boys' Bridge, which name I gave it from a wish to please my sons,\r\nwho had done so much to build it.\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we call the place which is most dear to us all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, my dear,\" said I to my wife, \"it is your turn. What shall we say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us call it The Nest,\" said she; and with that I gave each of my\r\nyoung birds a glass of sweet wine.\r\n\r\n\"Here's to 'The Nest,'\" said I; \"and may we live long to bless the day\r\nand the means that brought us here.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the heat of the day was past, I told my sons that I should be glad\r\nto take a walk with them. My wife said that she should like to go with\r\nus; so we left The Nest in charge of Turk, and bent our course to the\r\nbanks of the stream. On our way we went past some shrubs and rare herbs,\r\nwhich my wife knew well how to make use of should we fall sick; and\r\nErnest found a large spot of ground on which grew a fine kind of\r\nPO-TA-TO. At these the boys set to work with such zeal, that we soon had\r\na full bag of the ripe fruit. We then went on to Tent House, which we\r\nfound in the same state as when we left it to cross the stream on our\r\nway to the great tree.\r\n\r\nWe found that our ducks and geese had grown so wild that they would not\r\ncome near us; so, while my wife and I went to pick up such things as we\r\nthought we might take back with us, Ernest and Fritz were sent to catch\r\nthem, and to tie their legs and wings, and in this way we got them at\r\nlast to The Nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nIT took the whole of the next day to make a sledge, to which we tied\r\nthe ass, and drove to Tent House. On our sledge we put such of the casks\r\nwhich held food, and took them back to The Nest. Fritz and I went once\r\nmore to the wreck, and this time we brought off chests of clothes, pigs\r\nof lead, cart wheels, sacks of maize, oats, peas, and wheat. With a\r\nstrong bar we broke down some of the doors, and took such parts of the\r\nship as we thought would aid us to build our house, which as yet was far\r\nless safe than I could wish. These we bound with cords, and made them\r\nfloat back at the stern of the raft.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to the shore my wife and the three boys were there to greet\r\nus. My first care was to send for the sledge, and with this we took most\r\nof our new wealth up to The Nest.\r\n\r\nThe next day I told my sons that they must now learn to run, to leap, to\r\nclimb, and to throw stones straight at a mark, as all these things would\r\nbe of great use to them in their new mode of life.\r\n\r\nI next taught them to use the LAS-SO, by means of which men catch the\r\nwild horse on the vast plains of the New World. I tied two stones to the\r\nends of a cord some yards in length, and flung off one of them at the\r\ntrunk of a young tree; the cord went round and round it in a coil and\r\nbound it so tight that I could have drawn it to me had it not been fast\r\nin the ground. This trick the boys were not slow to learn; and Fritz,\r\nin a short time, could take an aim as well with a stone as he could with\r\nhis gun.\r\n\r\nAs yet we had not seen much of the isle; for it took most of our time\r\nto build the house. But one day we made up our minds that we would all\r\nstart on a tour. We rose at dawn, put the ass in the sledge, took what\r\nfood we thought we should need, and set out from The Nest just as the\r\nsun rose.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the wood where Fritz found the ape, he told them by what\r\nmeans we got the nuts, but now there were no apes there to throw them\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if one would but fall from the trees,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe words had but just left his lips when a large nut fell at his feet.\r\nHe made a start back, and two more came down near the same spot.\r\n\r\nAs the nuts were far from ripe, I was at a loss to know how they could\r\nfall off the tree, for I could not see an ape nor a bird near.\r\n\r\nI went close up to the tree, and saw a large land crab on its way down\r\nthe trunk. Jack struck a blow at him with a stick, but did not hit the\r\nbeast. He then took off his coat and threw it on the crab's head, while\r\nI made an end of him with an axe. I told them that these crabs climb\r\nthe trees and break off the nuts, as we had seen, and then come down to\r\nfeast on them at their ease.\r\n\r\n\"But how do they crack the nuts?\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"They make a hole through the shell at the thin end, and then suck them\r\ndry.\"\r\n\r\nThe dead crab was put in the sledge, and we went on through the wood.\r\nWhen we came to the Gourd Wood, we sat down to make some more bowls and\r\nflasks to take back with us. Ernest had gone to try what new thing he\r\ncould find, but he had not been from us long, when we heard him call out,\r\n\r\n\"A wild boar! A great wild boar! Come here, pray!\"\r\n\r\nWe took up our guns, and went at once with the dogs to the spot. We soon\r\nheard Turk give a loud bark, and just then we heard Ernest laugh, and\r\nsaw the two dogs come through a clump of brush wood, with our old sow\r\nfast by the ears. She did not seem to like the way in which they had\r\nput an end to her feast of fruit, so she ran back as soon as we told the\r\ndogs to let go their hold of her ears.\r\n\r\n\"But with all our sport,\" said Fritz, \"we have a poor show of game.\r\nLet us leave the young ones, and set off to see what we can meet with.\"\r\nErnest sat down with Frank, and we left them and my wife at the gourd\r\ntree, while Fritz and Jack set off with me to a high rock which we saw\r\non the right.\r\n\r\n\"Fritz, look here,\" said Jack, as he made his way to the rock.\r\n\r\n\"What have you found now?\" said Fritz.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what it is, but it's a fine prize.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I went up I saw at once that it was a large I-GUA-NA, the flesh and\r\neggs of which are both good for food. I had heard that these and such\r\nlike beasts will stand still if you play an air on a pipe. So I crept\r\nnear, and made a low sound with my lips, while I held in my right hand\r\na stout stick, to which I had tied a cord with a noose, and in my left\r\nhand a slight wand. I saw it first move its tail, and then draw its head\r\nfrom side to side, as if to look where the sound came from. I then threw\r\nthe noose round its neck, drew it tight, got on its back with a leap and\r\nthrust the wand up its nose, which is the sole part of the beast where\r\nthere are no hard scales. It bled at once, and was soon dead, nor did it\r\nseem to feel any pain. Our prize, which was near five feet long was no\r\nslight weight to lift. I got it at last on my back, and thus we went\r\nback to the gourd tree, where we found the rest quite safe.\r\n\r\nIt took us a long time to reach The Nest that night. My wife did her\r\nbest to dress some of the flesh of the land crab, but it was tough, and\r\ndid not taste so nice as the soup made from the beast that we had caught\r\nby the nose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFRITZ and I spent the whole of the next day in the woods. We took the\r\nass and one of the dogs with us, but left all else at home.\r\n\r\nOur way first lay through a dense wood, where we saw no end of small\r\nbirds, but such game could not now tempt Fritz to waste his shot. We\r\nthen had to cross a vast plain, and to wade through the high grass,\r\nwhich we did with care, lest we should tread on some strange thing that\r\nmight turn and bite us.\r\n\r\nWe came at last to a grove of small trees, and in their midst I saw a\r\nbush, which I knew to be the wax tree, for the wax grew on it like white\r\nbeads. I need not say how glad I was to find so great a prize. We had\r\nup to this time gone to bed as soon as the sun went down, for we had no\r\nlamp to use; but as we could now make wax lights, I told Fritz that we\r\nhad found what would add two or three hours per day to our lives. We\r\ntook as much of the wax as would serve us for some time, and then made\r\nour way out of the grove.\r\n\r\n\"How came you,\" said Fritz, \"to know so much of the queer beasts, trees,\r\nand plants that we have found here?\"\r\n\r\n\"When young,\" said I, \"I used to read all the books that fell in my way;\r\nand those that told of strange lands and what was to be seen in them had\r\nfor me as great a charm as they have for Ernest, who has read a great\r\ndeal, and knows more of plants than you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I will do the same if I but get the chance. Can you\r\ntell what is the name of that huge tree on the right? See, there are\r\nballs on the bark.\"\r\n\r\nWe went close to it, and found that these balls were of thick gum, which\r\nthe sun had made quite hard. Fritz tried to pull one of them off, but\r\nfelt that it clung tight to the bark, though he could change its shape\r\nwith his warm hands. \"Look,\" said he, \"I feel sure that this is the\r\nIN-DI-A RUB-BER which we used to clean our school books.\" I took a piece\r\nof it in my hand, and said, \"To be sure it is. What shall we not find\r\nin this rich land?\" I then told him how the men in the New World made\r\nflasks of this gum, in which form it is sent to all parts of the world.\r\n\"And I do not see why we should not make boots of it in the same way. We\r\nhave but to fill a sock with sand, then put gum all round it, while in a\r\nsoft state, till it is as thick as we need, then pour the sand out,\r\nand we shall have made a shoe or a boot that will at least keep out the\r\ndamp, and that is more than mine do just now.\"\r\n\r\nNot far from this we came to a bush, the leaves of which were strewn\r\nwith a white dust; and close by were two or three more in the same\r\nstate. I cut a slit in the trunk of one of these, and found it full of\r\nthe white dust, which I knew by the taste to be SA-GO. We took all of\r\nthis that we could get out of the tree, for it would add to our stock of\r\nfood; and when our bags were full we laid them on the back of the ass,\r\nand set off to find our way back to The Nest.\r\n\r\n\"Each day brings us fresh wealth,\" said my wife; \"but I think we might\r\nnow try to add to our goods.\" I knew that she had some fear lest we\r\nshould one day get lost in the woods, or meet with wild beasts, so I at\r\nonce said that we would now stay at home, at least for some days.\r\n\r\nMy first work was to make some wax lights, for my wife could then mend\r\nour clothes at night, while we sat down to talk. This done, the next\r\ntask they gave me was to make a churn. I took a large gourd, made a\r\nsmall hole in the side, and cut out as much as I could, so as to leave\r\nbut the rind. In this I put the cream, laid a piece on the hole, and\r\nbound it up so that none could come out. The boys then held a cloth, and\r\non it I put the gourd, which they rolled from side to side. They kept up\r\nthis game with great mirth for near an hour, when my wife took off the\r\nstring, and found that the churn had done its work well.\r\n\r\nAs our sledge was not fit to use on rough roads, my next work was to\r\nmake a cart. I had brought a pair of wheels from the wreck, so that my\r\ntask did not prove a hard one.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus at work, my wife and the boys took some of the fruit\r\ntrees we had brought with us, and put them in the ground where they\r\nthought they would grow best. On each side of the path that led from The\r\nNest to the Boy's Bridge they put a row of young nut trees. To make the\r\npath hard we laid down sand from the sea shore, and then beat it down\r\nwith our spades.\r\n\r\nWe were for six weeks at this and such like work. We were loth to spare\r\nany pains to make The Nest, and all that could be seen near it, look\r\nneat and trim, though there were no eyes but our own to view the scene.\r\n\r\nOne day I told my sons that I would try to make a flight of stairs in\r\nplace of the cane steps with rope sides, which were, to tell the truth,\r\nthe worst part of our house. As yet we had not used them much, but the\r\nrain would some day force us to keep in The Nest, and then we should\r\nlike to go up and down stairs with more ease than we could now climb\r\nthe rude steps. I knew that a swarm of bees had built their nest in the\r\ntrunk of our tree, and this led me to think that there might be a void\r\nspace in it some way up. \"Should this prove to be the case,\" I said,\r\n\"our work will be half done, for we shall then have but to fix the\r\nstairs in the tree round the trunk.\" The boys got up and went to the top\r\nof the root to tap the trunk, and to judge by the sound how far up the\r\nhole went. But they had to pay for their want of thought; the whole\r\nswarm of bees came out as soon as they heard the noise, stung their\r\ncheeks, stuck to their hair and clothes, and soon put them to flight.\r\n\r\nWe found that Jack, who was at all times rash, had struck the bees' nest\r\nwith his axe, and was much more hurt by them than the rest. Ernest, who\r\nwent to his work in his slow way, got up to it last, and thus did not\r\nget more than a sting or two, but the rest were some hours ere they\r\ncould see out of their eyes. I took a large gourd, which had long been\r\nmeant to serve for a hive, and put it on a stand, We then made a straw\r\nroof to keep it from the sun and wind, and as by this time it grew dark,\r\nwe left the hive there for the night.\r\n\r\nNext day, the boys, whose wounds were now quite well, went with me to\r\nhelp to move the bees to the new home we had made for them. Our first\r\nwork was to stop with clay all the holes in the tree but one through\r\nwhich the bees were wont to go in to their nest. To this I put the bowl\r\nof a pipe, and blew in the smoke of the weed as fast as I could. At\r\nfirst we heard a loud buzz like the noise of a storm afar off; but the\r\nmore I blew my pipe the less grew the sound, till at last the bees were\r\nquite still.\r\n\r\nWe now cut out a piece of the trunk, three feet square, and this gave us\r\na full view of the nest. Our joy was great to find such a stock of wax,\r\nfor I could see the comb reached far up the tree. I took some of the\r\ncomb, in which the bees lay in swarms, and put it by on the plank.\r\n\r\nWe then put the gourd on the comb that held the swarm, and took care\r\nthat the queen bee was not left out. By these means we soon got a hive\r\nof fine bees, and the trunk of the tree was left free for our use.\r\n\r\nWe had now to try the length of the hole. This we did with a long pole,\r\nand found it reached as far up as the branch on which our house stood.\r\n\r\nWe now cut a square hole in that side of the trunk next the sea shore,\r\nand made one of the doors that we had brought from the ship to fit in\r\nthe space. We then made the sides smooth all the way up, and with planks\r\nand the staves of some old casks, built up the stairs round a pole which\r\nwe made fast in the ground. To do this we had to make a notch in the\r\npole and one in the side of the trunk for each stair, and thus go up\r\nstep by step till we came to the top. Each day we spent a part of our\r\ntime at what we could now call the farm, where the beasts and fowls were\r\nkept, and did odd jobs as well, so that we should not make too great a\r\ntoil of the flight of stairs, which took us some six weeks to put up.\r\n\r\nOne day Fritz caught a fine EA-GLE, which he tied by the leg to a branch\r\nof the tree, and fed with small birds. It took him a long while to tame,\r\nbut in time he taught it to perch on his wrist, and to feed from his\r\nhand. He once let it go, and thought he would have lost it, but the bird\r\nknew it had a good friend, for it came back to the tree at night. From\r\nthat time it was left free, though we thought that some day its love of\r\nwar and wild sports would tempt it to leave us for the rocks of the sea\r\nshore, where Fritz had first found it.\r\n\r\nEach of my boys had now some pet to take care of, and, I may say, to\r\ntease, for they all thought they had a fair right to get some fun out of\r\nthe pets they could call their own; but they were kind to them, fed them\r\nwell, and kept them clean.\r\n\r\nIn what I may term my spare time, which was when I left off work out of\r\ndoors, I made a pair of gum shoes for each of my sons, in the way I had\r\ntold Fritz it could be done. I do not know what we should have done had\r\nwe not found the gum tree, for the stones soon wore out the boots we\r\nhad, and we could not have gone through the woods or trod the hard rocks\r\nwith bare feet.\r\n\r\nBy this time our sow had brought forth ten young pigs, and the hens had\r\neach a brood of fine chicks. Some we kept near us, but most of them went\r\nto the wood, where my wife said she could find them when she had need to\r\nuse them.\r\n\r\nI knew the time must now be near when, in this clime, the rain comes\r\ndown day by day for weeks, and that it would wash us out of The Nest if\r\nwe did not make a good roof to our house. Then our live stock would need\r\nsome place where they could rest out of the rain. The thatch for The\r\nNest was of course our first care; then we made a long roof of canes for\r\nour live stock, and on this we spread clay and moss, and then a thick\r\ncoat of tar, so that it was rain proof from end to end. This was held up\r\nby thick canes stuck deep in the ground, with planks made fast to them\r\nto form the walls, and round the whole we put a row of cask staves to\r\nserve for rails. In this way we soon had a barn, store room, and hay\r\nloft, with stalls for the cow, the ass, and what else we kept that had\r\nneed of a place to live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nFRANK one day found some long leaves, to which, from their shape, he\r\ngave the name of sword leaves. These he brought home to play with, and\r\nthen, when he grew tired of them, threw them down. As they lay on the\r\nfloor, Fritz took some of them in his hand, and found them so limp,\r\nthat he said he could plait them, and make a whip for Frank to drive the\r\nsheep and goats with. As he split them up to do this, I could not but\r\nnote their strength. This led me to try them, and I found that we had\r\nnow a kind of flax plant, which was a source of great joy to my wife.\r\n\r\n\"You have not yet found a thing,\" she said, \"that will be of more use to\r\nus than this. Go at once and search for some more of these leaves,\r\nand bring me the most you can of them. With these I can make you hose,\r\nshirts, clothes, thread, rope; in short, give me flax, and make me a\r\nloom and some frames, and I shall be at no loss for work when the rain\r\ncomes.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help a smile at my wife's joy when she heard the name of\r\nflax; for there was still much to do ere the leaves could take the shape\r\nof cloth. But two of the boys set off at once to try to find some more\r\nof the flax.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gone, my wife, full of new life, and with some show of\r\npride, told me how I should make the loom by means of which she was to\r\nclothe us from head to foot. In a short time they came back, and brought\r\nwith them a good load of the plant, which they laid at her feet. She now\r\nsaid she would lay by all else till she had tried what she could make of\r\nit. The first thing to be done was to steep the flax. To do this we took\r\nthe plant down to the marsh, tied up in small bales, as they pack hemp\r\nfor sale. The leaves were then spread out in the pond, and kept down\r\nwith stones, and left there in that state till it was time to take them\r\nout and set them in the sun to dry, when they would be so soft that we\r\ncould peel them with ease. It was two weeks ere the flax was fit for\r\nus to take out of the marsh. We spread it out on the grass in the sun,\r\nwhere it dried so quick that we took it home to The Nest the same day.\r\nIt was then put by till we could find time to make the wheels, reels,\r\nand combs which my wife said that she would want to turn our new found\r\nplant to its best use.\r\n\r\nWe now made haste to lay up a store of canes, nuts, wood, and such\r\nthings as we thought we might want; and took care, while it was still\r\nfine, to sow wheat, and all the grain we had left in our bags was soon\r\nput in the ground. The fear that the rain might come and put a stop to\r\nour work led us to take our meals in haste, and to make the days as long\r\nas we could see. We knew the rain was close at hand, for the nights were\r\ncold; large clouds could be seen in the sky, and the wind blew as we had\r\nnot felt it since the night our ship had struck on the rock.\r\n\r\nThe great change came at last. One night we were woke up out of our\r\nsleep with the noise made by the rush of the wind through the woods,\r\nand we could hear the loud roar of the sea far off. Then the dense storm\r\nclouds which we had seen in the sky burst on us, and the rain came down\r\nin floods. The streams, pools, and ponds on all sides were soon full,\r\nand the whole plain round us met our view as one vast lake. By good\r\nluck, the site of our house stood up out of the flood, and our group of\r\ntrees had the look of a small isle in the midst of the lake.\r\n\r\nWe soon found that The Nest was not built so well as we thought, for the\r\nrain came in at the sides, and we had good cause to fear that the wind\r\nwould blow the roof off. Once the storm made such a rush at it that we\r\nheard the beams creak, and the planks gave signs that there was more\r\nstrain on them than they could bear. This drove us from our room to the\r\nstairs in the trunk, on which we sat in a state of fear till the worst\r\nof the storm was past. Then we went down to the shed we had built on the\r\nground at the root of the tree, and made the best shift we could. All\r\nour stores were kept here, so that the space was too small to hold us,\r\nand the smell from the beasts made it far from a fit place for six of us\r\nto dwell in; but it was at least safe for a time, and this was of course\r\nthe first thing to be thought of. To dress our food we had to make a\r\nfire in the barn, and as there was no place to let out the smoke, it got\r\ndown our throats and made us cough all the day long.\r\n\r\nIt was now for the first time that my wife gave a sigh for her old Swiss\r\nhome. But we all knew that it was of no use to grieve, and each set to\r\nwork to do all he could to make the place look neat and clean. Some of\r\nour stores we took up the stairs out of our way, and this gave us more\r\nroom. As we had cut square holes in the trunk of the tree all the way\r\nup, and put in frames of glass that we got from the ship, my wife could\r\nsit on the stairs, with Frank at her feet, and mend our clothes. Each\r\nday I drove from the barn such beasts as could bear to be out in the\r\nrain. That we might not lose them, I tied bells round their necks; and\r\nif we found that they did not come back when the sun went down, Fritz\r\nand I went out to bring them in. We oft got wet through to the skin,\r\nwhich gave us a chill, and might have laid us up if my wife had not made\r\ncloth capes and hoods for us to wear. To make these rain proof, I spread\r\nsome of the gum on them while hot, and this, when dry, had the look of\r\noil cloth, and kept the head, arms, chest, and back free from damp. Our\r\ngum boots came far up our legs, so that we could go out in the rain and\r\ncome back quite free from cold and damp.\r\n\r\nWe made but few fires, for the air was not cold, save for an hour or two\r\nlate at night, and we did not cook more than we could help, but ate the\r\ndried meat, fowls, and fish we had by us.\r\n\r\nThe care of our beasts took us a great part of the day; then we made our\r\ncakes and set them to bake in a tin plate on a slow fire. I had cut a\r\nhole in the wall to give us light, and put a pane of glass in it to keep\r\nout the wind, but the thick clouds hid the sun from the earth, and the\r\nshade of the tree threw a gloom round our barn, so that our day light\r\nwas but short, and night came on far too soon. We then made use of our\r\nwax lights, and all sat round a bench. My wife had as much as she could\r\nwell do to mend the rents we made in our clothes. I kept a log, In\r\nwhich I put down, day by day, what we did and what we had seen; and\r\nthen Ernest wrote this out in a neat, clear hand, and made a book of it.\r\nFritz and Jack drew the plants, trees, and beasts which they had found,\r\nand these were stuck in our book. Each night we took it in turns to read\r\nthe Word of God, and then all knelt down to pray ere we went to bed.\r\nOurs was not a life of ease, it is true, but it was one of peace and\r\nhope; and we felt that God had been so kind to us that it would be a\r\ngreat sin to wish for what it did not please Him to grant us.\r\n\r\nMy wife did all she could to cheer us, and it was no strange thing for\r\nus to find that while we were out in the rain with the live stock, she\r\nhad made some new dish, which we would scent as soon as we put our heads\r\nin at the door. One night it was a thrush pie, the next a roast fowl,\r\nor some wild duck soup; and once in a while she would give us a grand\r\nfeast, and bring out some of all the good things we had in store.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our stay in doors we made up our minds that we would\r\nnot spend the next time of storm and rain, when it should come round, in\r\nthe same place. The Nest would serve us well in that time of year when\r\nit was fine and dry, but we should have to look out for some spot where\r\nwe could build a house that would keep us from the rain the next time\r\nthe storms came.\r\n\r\nFritz thought that we might find a cave, or cut one out of the rocks by\r\nthe sea shore. I told him that this would be a good plan, but would take\r\na long while to do. By this time the boys were all well used to hard\r\nwork, and they thought they would much like to try their skill at some\r\nnew kind of work.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"we will go to the rocks round Tent House the first fine\r\nday that comes, and try to find some place that will serve to keep us\r\nfrom the next year's storms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nI CAN not tell how glad we all were when we at last saw a change in\r\nthe sky, and felt once more the warm rays of the sun. In a few days the\r\nfloods sank in the earth, and left the ground of a bright green hue; the\r\nair grew warm and dry, and there were no more dark clouds to be seen in\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nWe found our young trees had put forth new leaves, and the seed we had\r\nsown had come up through the moist ground. The air had a fresh sweet\r\nsmell, for it bore the scent of the bloom which hung like snow flakes on\r\nthe boughs of the fruit trees; the songs and cries of the birds were to\r\nbe heard on all sides, and we could see them fly from tree to tree in\r\nsearch of twigs to build their nests. This in fact was the spring of the\r\nyear, when all things put forth new life; and we knew that the time was\r\nnow come when we could once more range the woods and till the soil, and\r\nthis made the boys leap for joy.\r\n\r\nSome planks had been blown off the roof of The Nest, and the rain had\r\ngot in here and there; so our first job was to mend our house, and make\r\nit fit to sleep in.\r\n\r\nThis done, Jack, Fritz, and I set out to Tent House. We found it in a\r\nsad state. The storm had thrown down the tent, blown off some of the\r\nsail cloth, and let in the rain on our casks, some of which held a store\r\nof food. Our boat was still safe, but the raft of tubs had broken Lip,\r\nand what there was left of it lay in splints on the shore.\r\n\r\nOur loss in the storm had been so great that I felt we ought at once to\r\nseek for some place on the rocks where we could put what was left.\r\n\r\nWe went all round the cliffs, in the hope that we might find a cave, but\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\n\"There is no way but to hew one out of the rock\", said Fritz, \"we must\r\nnot be beat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, Fritz,\" said Jack; \"we have each an axe. Why not try this\r\ncliff at once?\"\r\n\r\nI gave them leave to try, and we soon set to work at the rock. From this\r\nspot we had a good view of the whole bay, and could see both banks of\r\nthe stream.\r\n\r\nWith a piece of chalk I made a mark on the side of the cliff, to show\r\nthe width and height that the cave should be cut. Then each took an axe\r\nto try what kind of stuff our rock was made of. We found it a hard kind\r\nof stone; and, as we were not used to this sort of work, we had not done\r\nmuch when the time came for us to leave off.\r\n\r\nWe came back next day, and got on with more speed, though we thought\r\nit would not take us less than six months to make the cave, if our work\r\nwere done at the same rate each day.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five or six days we had got through the face of the rock,\r\nand we found the stone soft. In a day or two more we came to what was\r\nbut hard clay, which gave way at a slight blow from the axe.\r\n\r\n\"We need not fear now,\" said I, \"for we shall soon have a hole as large\r\nas we want.\"\r\n\r\nWith the earth we took out we made a ridge in front of the cliff. The\r\nboys now got on so well, and dug so much out, that I had hard work to\r\nthrow up the earth on the bank.\r\n\r\nOne day, as Jack stuck his pick in at the back of the cave, which was\r\nnow more than eight feet from the front, a great mass of the rock fell\r\nin, and he cried out, \"Look here! I have got through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Through what?\" said I. \"Not through your hand, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, but through the rock.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, Fritz set up a loud laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Why not say through the world at once, and push your crow bar in till\r\nyou reach EU-ROPE, which, Ernest says, lies in a straight line from our\r\nfeet. I should like to have a peep down, such a hole, for I might thus\r\nget a sight of our dear Swiss home.\"\r\n\r\nFritz and I went up to the wall and found that Jack was right, for he\r\nhad come to a clear space. His first thought was to jump in; but as I\r\nknew that there might be foul air in the cave, I would not let him risk\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nThe boys then set fire to some dry grass, and thrust it in the hole, but\r\nit went out at once, which was a sure sign that the air was not fit to\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nI knew that we had brought from the wreck a box full of fire works,\r\nwhich were used on board to make signs to ships far out at sea. I sent\r\nFritz to Tent House for these, though I thought that they might be too\r\ndamp to make use of. When he came back, I set light to some of them,\r\nand threw them in the hole. They flew round, and threw out a stream of\r\nsparks that lit up the cave. When these were burnt out, we put in a heap\r\nof straw and threw a light on it. This was now soon in a blaze, and gave\r\nus a clear view of the cave; but it was too deep for us to see the end.\r\n\r\nOur joy was so great that we sent Jack off home to The Nest to tell the\r\ngood news, and to bring back some wax lights. I did not deem it safe for\r\nus to go in the cave in the dark, for there might be pools or deep dry\r\npits in the ground.\r\n\r\nFritz and I had just thrown up on the bank the last spade full of earth\r\nthat had been dug out, when we heard a loud shout. We got up on the top\r\nof the cave, and saw that Jack had brought back a tribe at his heels.\r\nThe large cart, drawn by the cow and the ass, came on at a slow pace,\r\nled by Jack on a black ox, and in it were my wife, Frank, and Ernest.\r\n\r\nBy the help of a flint and steel I soon lit some of the wax lights, and\r\ngave one to each. I went in first and led the way, and the rest kept\r\nclose at my back. We had not gone on more than a few steps when we came\r\nto a dead stop, struck with awe at the grand sight that met our view.\r\nThe walls and roof of the cave were lit up, as it were, with star-like\r\ngems, while some hung down like glass drops from the roof, and some rose\r\nup from the ground at its sides like blocks of spar. I broke off a piece\r\nand put it on my tongue.\r\n\r\n\"What does it taste like?\" said Jack.\r\n\r\n\"I find,\" said I, \"that we are in a cave of rock salt.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall not have to scrape the rocks to get our salt now,\" said\r\nErnest, \"for there is more here than would serve a whole town for a\r\nlifetime.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we went back to The Nest that night we laid out a plan for our new\r\nhome, for there could be no doubt that the cave was the best place for\r\nus to dwell in, though we should still sleep in The Nest when we went on\r\nthat side of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe next day we all set to work; the floor of the cave was quite smooth,\r\nand the walls dry, so that we could build at once. We first cut holes in\r\nthe sides of the rock to let in the light, and then brought frames and\r\npanes of glass from The Nest, and put them in. We then brought all the\r\nplanks and wood we could find, and built a strong wall in the midst of\r\nthe cave. On the right side of this wall we made three rooms, two of\r\nwhich were to be used as bed rooms, and one to take our meals in. On the\r\nleft side was a room for my wife to cook in, one to work in, to which\r\nwe gave the name of the shop, and a place with stalls in it for our live\r\nstock. At the back of these was a store house, where we could keep our\r\nstock of food and the whole of our spare goods.\r\n\r\nI need not say that it took us some months to do all this, nor that we\r\nhad to toil hard day by day, from morn till night, ere we got to the end\r\nof our task; but the end did come at last, and then the joy we felt that\r\nwe had done all this with our own hands more than paid us for our toil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nOUR fields near Tent House had by this time brought forth good crops of\r\nwheat, maize, beans, and peas; but as the work of the Cave had for some\r\nweeks kept us on this side of the stream, we did not know in what state\r\nwe should find our crops at The Nest.\r\n\r\nOne day we all set out for our old home. We found our corn fields of a\r\nrich brown hue, and saw that the wheat was, for the most part, fit to\r\nreap. This, and a large patch of rye we cut down, and, as we did so,\r\nwhole flocks of birds took to wing when we got near them, while quails\r\nwere seen to run off at the sight of our dogs, who had no lack of sport\r\nthat day.\r\n\r\nWe laid by the seed that was quite ripe till the time should come for us\r\nto sow it, and put the rest in sacks. Some of the wheat was laid up in\r\nsheaves till we should have time to beat out the grain.\r\n\r\nWhen we left The Nest for the Cave, we could not find the hand mill that\r\nwe had brought from the ship. This now came to light, and we took care\r\nto pack it up to take with us, as we should want it to grind our corn.\r\n\r\nThat night we slept once more in the great tree; but I must say that we\r\ndid not now sleep so sound there as we used to do, nor did we feel so\r\nsafe as we did in our rooms at Rock House.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were to start a plan by means of which our live stock\r\nwould not want so much of our care. They had bred so fast that we could\r\nwell spare some of them, and these I thought might be left in some place\r\nto seek their own food, and yet be in reach should we want them.\r\n\r\nMy wife took from her hen roost ten young fowls, and I took four young\r\npigs, four sheep, and two goats. These we put in our large cart, with\r\nsuch tools as we thought we should need, tied the black ox, the cow, and\r\nthe ass to the shafts, and then set off from The Nest.\r\n\r\nWe had to cross a wide plain, and here we met with some dwarf plants on\r\nwhich, as Jack would have it, grew snow balls.\r\n\r\nFritz ran to see what they were, and brought me a twig to which clung\r\nballs of snow white down. I held it up to show my wife, for I knew the\r\nsight would please her still more than her sons.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said I, \"this is the COT-TON plant, which you have oft tried to\r\nfind. It seems to grow here as thick as weeds, and, if I am a judge, it\r\nis of the best kind.\"\r\n\r\nWe got as much of this as our bags would hold, and my wife took care to\r\npluck some of the ripe seed, that we might raise a crop in our grounds\r\nat Tent House.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the plain we came to the brow of a high hill, from which\r\nthe eye fell on a view the like of which we had not yet seen. Trees of\r\nall kinds grew on the sides of the hill, and a clear stream ran through\r\nthe plain at its base, and shone bright in the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nWe said at once that this should be the site of our new farm. Close by\r\nwe found a group of trees, the trunks of which, as they stood, would do\r\nfor the main props of the house.\r\n\r\nI had long had a mind to build a boat, and here I at last came on a tree\r\nthat would suit. Fritz and I went for a mile or two in search of what we\r\ncould find, and by the time we came back my wife had put up our tent for\r\nthe night. We then all sat down to sup, and went to rest on beds made of\r\nthe bags of the white down that we brought from the trees on the plain.\r\n\r\nThe next day we rose at dawn. The trees which were to form the frame of\r\nour farm house stood on a piece of land eight yards long by five wide. I\r\nmade a deep cut in each of the trunks, ten feet from the ground, and put\r\nup cross beams to form a roof, on which we laid some bark in such a way\r\nthat the rain would run off.\r\n\r\nWe were hard at work for some days at the Farm House. The walls we built\r\nof thin laths and long reeds, wove close for six feet from the ground,\r\nbut the rest we made of thin cross bars to let in both light and air. We\r\nmade racks to store bay and such like food for the live stock, and put\r\nby some grain for the fowls, for our plan was to come from time to time\r\nto feed them, till they got used to the place.\r\n\r\nOur work took us more time than we thought; and as our store of food got\r\nlow, we sent Fritz and Jack home to bring us a fresh stock, and to feed\r\nthe beasts we had left at Tent House.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gone, Ernest and I made a tour of the woods for some\r\nmiles round the new Farm. We first took the course of the stream that\r\nran by the foot of the hill. Some way up we came to a marsh on the edge\r\nof a small lake, and here in the swamp grew a kind of wild rice, now\r\nripe on the stalk, round which flew flocks of birds. We shot five or six\r\nof these, and I was glad to note the skill with which Ernest now used\r\nhis gun. I took some of the rice, that my wife might judge how far it\r\nwas of use to us as food.\r\n\r\nWe went quite round the lake, and saw plants and trees that were not\r\nknown to me, and birds that Ernest said he had not seen in any of the\r\nwoods near The Nest. But we were most struck with the sight of a pair of\r\nblack swans, and a troop of young ones that came in their train. Ernest\r\nwould have shot at them, but I told him not to kill what we did not want\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nWe did not get back till late in the day. Jack and Fritz, whom we met\r\njust as we came round the foot of the bill, had done their task well,\r\nfor they had a good stock of food in a sack that lay on the back of the\r\nass, and they brought the good news that all was well at home.\r\n\r\nWe spent four more days at the Farm, and then left it in such a state as\r\nto be fit for our use when we chose to go back to it.\r\n\r\nThe Farm House was but a part of our plan, for we had made up our minds\r\nto build a sort of half way house, or cot, in which we could rest on our\r\nway to the Farm. This took us six days to do. The spot we chose lay by\r\nthe side of a brook, and was just such a place as would tempt, one to\r\nstop and rest in the shade of the trees, that grew on the bank. While at\r\nthe brook, I made a boat out of the tree we found at the Farm, and took\r\nit back with us to Tent House in the cart.\r\n\r\nWe had still two months ere the rain would set in, and this left us time\r\nto put the last touch to our cave. We laid the whole floor with clay,\r\nand spread on it some fine sand, which we beat down till it was quite\r\nsmooth and firm. On this we put sail cloth, and threw down goat's hair\r\nand wool made moist with gum. This was well beat, and, when dry, made a\r\nkind of felt mat that was warm and soft to tread on, and would keep the\r\ndamp from our feet.\r\n\r\nBy the time these works were done, our cave was in a fit state for us\r\nto dwell in. We did not now dread the rain, for we were safe out of its\r\nreach, and there was no need that we should go out in it. We had a warm\r\nlight shop to work in by day, a snug place where we could take our meals\r\nand dry bed rooms in which we could sleep in peace. Our live stock we\r\nkept in a shed at the back of the cave, and our store room held all that\r\nwe could want.\r\n\r\nWhen the rain at length set in, we all had some task that kept us close\r\nat work in the cave. My wife took her wheel or her loom, both of which\r\nI had made for her, for this kind of work fell to her share from choice.\r\nBy the help of the wheels of one of the ship's guns I had made a lathe,\r\nand with this I could turn legs for stools and chairs. Ernest, too, was\r\nfond of the lathe, and soon learned to do such work quite as well as I.\r\n\r\nAt dusk, when we had done our work for the day, we brought out our stock\r\nof books, and sat down to read by the light of a lamp.\r\n\r\nAt times, Jack and Prank would play a tune on their flutes, which I had\r\nmade out of reeds; and my wife, who had a sweet voice, would sing some\r\nof the old Swiss songs, that brought to our minds the joys of home.\r\n\r\nThough we were by no means dull, nor in want of work to fill up our\r\ntime, we were glad when the time came for the rain to cease, and when\r\nwe could gaze once more on the green fields. We went out the first fine\r\nday, and took a long walk by the base of the cliff. On the shore we\r\nfound a dead whale, which the sea had no doubt thrown up in the storm.\r\nWe had long felt the need of oil; for though we had a lamp, we had\r\nnaught but our wax lights to put in it, and these gave a poor light to\r\nread by. The next day we cut up the whale, and put the flesh in tubs. It\r\nwas far from a clean job, for the oil ran down our clothes and made them\r\nsmell; but as we could change them for new ones, thanks to the hemp and\r\nmy wife's skill, we did not mind that, for the oil was now worth more to\r\nus than our clothes, though at one time we should not have thought so.\r\n\r\nOne day we all set out on a tour to the Farm. Jack and Frank had gone\r\non first, while my wife and I were as yet close to the Cave. All at once\r\nthe boys came back, and Fritz said, \"Look at that strange thing on its\r\nway up the path. What can it be?\"\r\n\r\nI cast my eye on the spot and cried out, \"Fly all of you to the Cave!\r\nfly for your lives!\" for I saw it was a huge snake, or boa, that would\r\nmake a meal of one of us, if we did not get out of its way.\r\n\r\nWe all ran in doors, and put bars up to the door of the Cave. A large\r\ndove cote had been made on the roof, and to this we got up through a\r\nhole in the rock.\r\n\r\nErnest took aim with his gun, and shot at the snake, so did Fritz and\r\nJack, but it gave no sign that they had hit it. I then tried my skill,\r\nbut it did not seem to feel my shot any more than theirs, though I was\r\nsure I must have struck its head. Just as we took aim at it once more,\r\nwe saw it turn round and glide through the reeds in the marsh.\r\n\r\nOur fears kept us for three long days in the Cave. The snake gave no\r\nsign that could lead us to think it was still near, but the ducks and\r\ngeese had left the spot where their nests were, and this we knew to be\r\na bad sign. On the fourth day I went to the door, with a view to let out\r\nsome of the beasts to graze, for we were short of food for them. The ass\r\nwas just at my back, and as soon as it saw the light, made a rush to get\r\nout. Off it went, straight to the sands, with its heels in the air, but\r\njust as it got to the marsh we saw the boa glide out from the reeds,\r\npart its wide jaws and make for its prey. The ass at once saw its foe,\r\nbut stood still as if struck with fear, and in less time than I take to\r\ntell it, our old friend was tight in the folds of the boa.\r\n\r\nThis was a sad sight for all of us, yet we could not take our eyes off\r\nthe snake, but saw it crush the poor beast, and then gorge its prey.\r\nWhen it had put the whole of the ass out of sight, it lay down on the\r\nsand quite still, as if it had gone to sleep or died.\r\n\r\n\"Now is the time to seal the fate of our foe,\" said I to Fritz; and\r\nwith that we went out with our guns. When we got near, we both took a\r\nstraight aim, and each put a ball in its head. This made it move with a\r\nstart, and writhe as if in pain.\r\n\r\n\"See how its eyes glare on us with rage. Now load your gun, and let us\r\nput a bit more lead in him.\"\r\n\r\nOur next shot went in his eyes. It then shook as with a strong spasm,\r\nand fell dead on the sand.\r\n\r\nA shout of joy brought my wife and the three boys to the spot. The state\r\nof fear they had been kept in for three whole days had made them quite\r\nill, but now the joy of Jack and Frank knew no bounds, for they leaped\r\non the snake and beat it as if they would go mad.\r\n\r\nMy wife said that the death of the boa took a great weight off her mind,\r\nfor she thought it would lie in wait for us near the Cave, starve us\r\nout, and then kill us as it had done the poor ass.\r\n\r\nWe slit up the snake, and took out the flesh of the ass, which the boys\r\nlaid in a grave near Tent House. The boa's skin we hung up at the door\r\nof the Cave, over which Ernest wrote the words, \"No ass to be found\r\nhere,\" which we all thought to be a good joke.\r\n\r\nOne day late in the spring I went with my three sons a long way from the\r\nCave. My wife and Frank were left at our Half Way House, to wait till we\r\ncame back, but the dogs went with us. Our route lay far up the course of\r\na small stream, which had its source some miles north of the Farm House.\r\nThe ground was new to us, but we could not well lose our way, for on the\r\nright stood a hill from which we could see the whole of the plain.\r\n\r\n\r\nErnest had gone with one of the dogs to a cave that he had spied at the\r\nfoot of the hill, but we saw him turn round and run back with Turk at\r\nhis heels. As soon as he thought his voice would reach us, he cried out,\r\n\"A bear! A bear! come to my help!\"\r\n\r\nWe could now see that there were two great beasts at the mouth of the\r\ncave. At a word from us both the dogs, flew to fight the bear that stood\r\nin front.\r\n\r\nFritz took up his post at my side, while Jack and Ernest kept in the\r\nrear. Our first shot was \"a miss,\" as Jack said; but we took a sure aim\r\nthe next time, and both shots told. We would have let fly at them once\r\nmore from this spot, but as we thought we might hit our brave dogs, who\r\nwere now in the heat of a hard fight with their foes, we ran up close to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Fritz,\" said I, \"take a straight aim at the head of the first,\r\nwhile I fire on the one at his back.\"\r\n\r\nWe both shot at once; the bears gave a loud growl, and then, with a\r\nmoan, fell dead at our feet.\r\n\r\nAs it was now time to go back, we put the bears in the cave, but took\r\ncare to cut off their paws, which form a dish fit to grace the feast of\r\na king.\r\n\r\nWe had a long walk back to the place where I had left my wife. The boys\r\ntold her what a hard fight the dogs had with the bears, and how Fritz\r\nand I had shot them, and then gave her the paws. With the aid of Frank\r\nshe had fed our live stock and brought in wood to make up our watch fire\r\nfor the night, so we sat down to sup at once, and then went to rest.\r\n\r\nNext day we put our beasts to the cart and drove as far as the bear's\r\nden. As we came near to the spot a flock of birds flew out of the mouth\r\nof the cave, two or three of which Fritz brought down with his gun. It\r\ntook us the whole day to cut up the bears. The hams were laid by to be\r\nsmoke dried; while my wife took charge of the fat and the skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWE had now so much work to do, and the days and weeks came and went so\r\nquick, that I do not think we should have known the time of year had it\r\nnot been for our log.\r\n\r\nSome days were spent at the Cave, where we made our goods, ground our\r\nflour, stored our food, and kept our tame live stock. Then we had to\r\ntake care of our crops in the fields near The Nest, and this took us two\r\nor three days in each month. Once in ten days at least we went to the\r\nFarm on the hill, and at the same time made a call at the Half Way\r\nHouse; so that there was not a day that we had not our hands quite full.\r\nNow and then we went out to hunt for sport or to add to our stock of\r\nbeasts, which had grown so large that there were few we could name that\r\nhad not been caught and brought home. We had birds of the air, fowls of\r\nthe land, and beasts of all kinds' from the great black ox of the plain\r\nto the small wild RAB-BIT that came and made its hole close by our cave.\r\n\r\nBut there was one bird that we had not yet caught, though we had seen\r\nit two or three times in the woods. This was the OS-TRICH. Fritz found a\r\nnest with some eggs in it, and this led us to make a tour with a view to\r\ncatch one of the old birds. We rose that day ere it was light, and set\r\nout at dawn, each on the back of a good steed.\r\n\r\nAs we should have to hunt through the woods, my wife was left at home;\r\nand Ernest, who did not like rough work, chose to stay with her. We made\r\nit a rule to take one of the dogs with us when we went out to hunt, but\r\non this day we thought it wise to let them both come.\r\n\r\nFritz took us straight to where he had seen the nest, which was not more\r\nthan a few miles up the stream. When we came in sight of the spot, we\r\nsaw four great birds, as if on their way to meet us. As they drew near\r\nwe kept the dogs well in, and made no noise, so that they did not stop\r\ntill they came near us.\r\n\r\nFritz had brought his Ea-gle with him, which he now let fly. At one\r\nswoop the bird came down on the head of the Os-trich, held on with its\r\nbeak, and struck out its wings with great force, as if to stun it.\r\n\r\nWe now rode up close to the scene of war. Jack first flung a cord round\r\nthe legs of the bird, which made it fall to the ground. I then threw my\r\npouch on its head, and, strange to say, it lay down as still as a lamb.\r\n\r\nI now tied both its legs with cords, but left it just room to walk. We\r\nthen made it fast to the two bulls that had brought Jack and Frank all\r\nthe way from home, and put one of them on each side. They next got up on\r\ntheir steeds, and I took the pouch from the head of the bird. As soon as\r\nit could see, it gave a wild stare, and then fought to get free.\r\n\r\nThe boys then put spurs to the flanks of their steeds, and when the bird\r\nhad made a few starts back, as if to try the strength of the cords which\r\nheld it, it set off with a run, and the bulls at each side made it keep\r\nup a smart pace.\r\n\r\nFritz and I now went in search of the nest, which we soon found. I took\r\nthe eggs from it and put them in a bag I had brought to hold them, in\r\nwhich I put some wool and moss, so that they should not break.\r\n\r\nIt did not take us long to get up to the two boys, who had gone on\r\nfirst, and we were glad to find that the poor bird had made up its mind\r\nto its fate, and kept up well with the pace of the bulls.\r\n\r\nWhen we got in sight of home, my wife and Ernest, who had been on the\r\nlook out for us, came forth to meet us; and the strange way in which we\r\nbrought home our new prize made them laugh. I need not say that we took\r\ngreat care of it.\r\n\r\nThe next day we built it a house, with a space in front for it to walk\r\nup and down, round which were put rails, so that it could not get out.\r\nAt first it was shy, and would not take any food, so that we had to\r\nforce some balls of maize down its throat; but in a short time it took\r\ngrain from the hands of my wife, and soon grew quite tame.\r\n\r\nThe boys now set to work to break it in for use. They taught it first\r\nto bear them on its back. Then they put a pair of string reins in its\r\nmouth, and made it turn which way they chose to pull, and to walk, or\r\nrun, or stand still, as it was bid. Thus, in a month from the time we\r\ncaught it, the boys made it take them on its back to and from the Farm\r\nor The Nest, in less than half the time an ox would go; so that it came\r\nto be the best steed we had to ride on.\r\n\r\nThe eggs we found in the nest were put in a warm dry place, and though\r\nwe scarce thought our care would bring live birds out of the shells,\r\nwe had the joy to hatch three of them, and this led us to hope that we\r\nshould ere long have a steed for each of our sons.\r\n\r\nMy work at this time was by no means light. Our hats and caps were all\r\nworn out, and with skins of the musk cat I had to make new ones. The\r\nbears' skins were laid in the sun to dry, and of these we made fur\r\ncoats, which would keep us warm when the cold wet nights came round, and\r\nthere were some left to serve as quilts or rugs for our beds.\r\n\r\nI now tried my hand at a new craft. I dug some clay out of the bed of\r\nthe stream, and taught the boys to knead it up with sand, and some talc\r\nthat had been ground as fine as road drift. I had made a lathe with a\r\nwheel, and by its aid the clay left my bands in the shape of plates,\r\ncups, pots, and pans. We then burnt them in a rude kiln, and though at\r\nleast one half broke with the heat and our want of skill, still those\r\nthat came out whole more than paid me for my toil, and kept up my wife's\r\nstock of delf. Some of the jars were set round with red and blue beads,\r\nand these were put on a shelf as works of art, and kept full of long\r\ndried grass.\r\n\r\nThe time was now at hand when we must reap our grain and store the ripe\r\ncrops that were still on the ground; and, in fact, there was so much to\r\nbe done, that we scarce knew what to do first. The truth must be told\r\nthat our wants did not keep pace with the growth of our wealth, for the\r\nland was rich, and we had but a few mouths to fill.\r\n\r\nWe knew that we might leave the roots in the ground for some time, as\r\nthe soil was dry, but that the grain would soon spoil; so we made the\r\ncorn our first care. When it was all cut and brought home, our next task\r\nwas to thresh it. The floor of our store room was now as hard as a rock,\r\nfor the sun had dried it, and there was not a crack to be seen. On this\r\nwe laid the ears of ripe corn, from which the long straw had been cut,\r\nand sent the boys to bring in such of our live stock as were fit for the\r\nwork to be next done.\r\n\r\nJack and Fritz were soon on the backs of their steeds, and thought it\r\nfine fun to make them course round the floor and tread out the grain.\r\nErnest and I had each a long fork, with which we threw the corn at their\r\nfeet, so that all of it might be trod on. The ox on which Jack sat put\r\ndown his head and took a bunch of the ears in his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Jack, \"it is not put there for you to eat, off you go!\" and\r\nwith that he gave it a lash with his whip.\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said I, \"do you not know what God has said in his Word? We must\r\nnot bind up the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. This brings\r\nto my mind the fact that the means we now take to thresh our wheat were\r\nthose used by the Jews in the days of old.\"\r\n\r\nTo sort the chaff from the grain we threw it up with our spades while\r\nthe land or sea breeze blew strong. The draught which came in at the\r\ndoor took the light chaff with it to one side of the room, while the\r\ngrain fell straight to the ground by its own weight.\r\n\r\nThe maize we left to dry in the sun, and then beat out the grain with\r\nlong skin thongs. By this means we got a store of the soft leaves of\r\nthis plant, which my wife made use of to stuff our beds.\r\n\r\nWhen all the grain had been put in our store room, some in sacks and the\r\nrest in dry casks, we took a walk one day to our fields, and found that\r\nflocks of birds, most of which were quails, had come there to feed. This\r\ngave us a fine day's sport with our guns, and the next year we did not\r\nfail to look for them, so that the fields were made to yield a stock of\r\ngame as well as a crop of grain.\r\n\r\nWith but slight change in our mode of life, we spent ten long years in\r\nour strange home. Yet the time did not seem long to us. Each day brought\r\nwith it quite as much work as we could do, so that weeks and months and\r\nyears flew past, till at last we gave up all hope that we should leave\r\nthe isle or see our old Swiss home, the thought of which was still dear\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nBut the lapse of ten years had wrought a great change in our sons.\r\nFrank, who was but a mere child when we first came, had grown up to be\r\na strong youth; and Jack was as brave a lad as one could wish to see.\r\nFritz, of course, was now a young man, and took a large share of the\r\nwork off my hands. Ernest had just come of age, and his shrewd mode of\r\nthought and great tact was as great a help to us as was the strength and\r\nskill of the rest.\r\n\r\nTo crown all, it was a rare thing for them to be ill; and they were free\r\nfrom those sins which too oft tempt young men to stray from the right\r\npath. My wife and I did our best to train them, so that they might know\r\nright from wrong; and it gave us great joy to find that what we told\r\nthem sunk deep in their hearts, and, like ripe seed sown in rich soil,\r\nbrought forth good fruit.\r\n\r\nI need not say that in the course of ten years we had made great strides\r\nin those arts which our wants had first led us to learn. When we first\r\ncame the land near Tent House was a bare waste; now it bore fine crops,\r\nand was kept as neat as a Swiss farm. At the foot of the hill by the\r\nside of Rock Cave was a large plot of ground, which we laid out in beds,\r\nand here we grew herbs and shrubs, and such plants as we used for food.\r\nNear this we dug a pond, and by means of a sluice which led from the\r\nstream, we kept our plants fresh in times of drought. Nor was this the\r\nsole use we made of the pond; for in it we kept small fish and crabs,\r\nand took them out with a rod and line when we had need of food, and time\r\nto spare for that kind of sport. In the ground round the mouth of the\r\nCave we drove a row of strong canes, bound at the top to a piece of\r\nwood, so as to form a fence, up which grew a vine, and, at each side,\r\nplants that threw a good show of gay bloom crept up to meet it. Shells\r\nof great size and strange shapes were got from the shore, and these we\r\nbuilt up here and there with burnt clay, so as to form clumps of rock\r\nwork, on which grew ferns and rare plants. All this gave a charm to our\r\nhome, and made the grounds round it a source of joy when, we laid by our\r\nwork for the day. In fact, we thought there was now scarce a thing to\r\nwish for that we had not got.\r\n\r\nOur cares were few, and our life was as full of joy and peace as we\r\ncould well wish; yet I oft cast a look on the sea, in the hope that\r\nsome day I should spy a sail, and once more greet a friend from the wide\r\nworld from which we had been so long shut out. This hope, vague as it\r\nwas, led me to store up such things as would bring a price, if we had\r\nthe chance to sell them; they might prove a source of wealth to us if a\r\nship came that way, or would at least help to pay the charge of a cruise\r\nback to the land we came from.\r\n\r\nIt is but just to say that the boys did not share my hopes, nor did they\r\nseem to wish that we should leave the place where they had been brought\r\nup. It was their world, and the cave, to which we gave the name Rock\r\nHouse, was more dear to them than any spot on the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Go back!\" Fritz would say; \"to leave our cave, that we dug with our own\r\nhands; to part with our dear kind beasts and birds; to bid good-by to\r\nour farms, and so much that is our own, and which no one in the world\r\nwants. No, no! You can not wish us to leave such a spot.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear wife and I both felt that age would soon creep on us, and we\r\ncould not help some doubts as to the fate of our sons. Should we stay\r\nand end our days here, some one of us would out-live the rest, and this\r\nthought came oft to my mind, and brought with it a sense of dread I\r\ncould not get rid of. It made me pray to God that He would save us all\r\nfrom so dire a fate as to die far from the sound of the voice of man,\r\nwith no one to hear our last words, or lay us in the earth when He\r\nshould call us to our rest.\r\n\r\nMy wife did not share this dread. \"Why should we go back?\" she would\r\nsay. \"We have here all that we can wish for. The boys lead a life of\r\nhealth, free from sin, and live with us, which might not be the case if\r\nwe went out in the world. Let us leave our fate in the hands of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAs Fritz and Ernest were now men, they were of course free to go where\r\nthey chose, and to come back when their will led them home. Thus, from\r\ntime to time they took long trips, and went far from Rock House. They\r\nhad fine boats and strong steeds, and of these they made such good use\r\nthat there was scarce a spot for leagues round that was not well known\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nAt one time, Fritz had been so long from home that we had a dread lest\r\nhe should have lost his way, or fallen a prey to wild beasts. When he\r\ncame back he told us a long tale of what he had seen and where he had\r\nbeen, and how he had brought with him birds, beasts, moths, and such\r\nstrange things as he thought Ernest would like to see. When he had done,\r\nhe drew me out into our grounds and said he had a strange thing to tell\r\nme. It seems that he found a piece of white cloth tied to the foot of a\r\nbird which he had struck down with a stick, on which were these words:\r\n\"Save a poor soul, who is on the rock from which you may see the smoke\r\nrise.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought that this rock could not be far off, and that he ought to set\r\noff at once in search of it.\r\n\r\n\"I have a thought,\" said he; \"I will tie a piece of cloth, like that I\r\nfound, to the leg of the bird, and on it I will write, 'Have faith in\r\nGod: help is near.' If the bird goes back to the place from whence it\r\ncame, our brief note may reach the eye of the lone one in the rock. At\r\nany rate, it can do no harm, and may do some good.\"\r\n\r\nHe at once took the bird, which was an AL-BA-TROSS, tied the strip of\r\ncloth to its foot, and let it go.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said he, \"tell me what you think of this. If we should, find\r\na new friend, what a source of joy it will be. Will you join me in the\r\nsearch?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I will,\" said I; \"and so shall the rest; but we will not yet\r\ntell them of this.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all glad to take a trip in the large boat, but they could not\r\nmake out why we went in such haste.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" said Jack, \"Fritz has found some queer thing on the coast\r\nthat he can't bring home, and wants us to see it. But I dare say we\r\nshall know what it all means in good time.\"\r\n\r\nFritz was our guide, and went first in his bark boat, or CA-NOE. In this\r\nhe could go round the rocks and shoals that girt the coast, which would\r\nnot have been safe for the large boat. He went up all the small creeks\r\nwe met with on the way, and kept a sharp look-out for the smoke by which\r\nhe would know the rock we came out to find.\r\n\r\nI must tell you that once when he came to these parts with Ernest he met\r\nwith a TI-GER, and would have lost his life had it not been for his pet\r\nEa-gle. The brave bird, to save Fritz from the beast, made a swoop down\r\non its head. Fritz thus got off with a scratch or two, but the poor bird\r\nwas struck dead by a blow from the paw of its foe. This was a sad loss\r\nto Fritz, for his pet had been a kind friend, and would go with him at\r\nall times when he went far from home.\r\n\r\nThere was scarce a spot we came to that did not bring to the mind of\r\none of us some such tale as this, so that we were full of talk while the\r\nboat bore us on.\r\n\r\nWe had been out some days, but could find no trace of what we went in\r\nsearch. I rose from my berth at dawn, and went on deck with Fritz. I\r\ntold him that as we had no clue to the place, we must now give up the\r\nsearch. He did not seem to like this, but no more was said. That day we\r\nspent on shore, and came back to our boat to sleep at night. Next day we\r\nwere to change our course, and trace our way back, for the wind now blew\r\nfrom the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen I went on deck next day I found a short note from Fritz, in which\r\nhe told me that he could not give up the search, but had gone some way\r\nup the coast in his small boat. \"Let me beg of you,\" he wrote, \"to lie\r\nin wait for me here till I come back.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had been gone two days, I felt that I ought to tell my wife the\r\ncause of our trip, as it might ease her mind, and she now had some fear\r\nlest her son should not be safe. She heard me to the end, and then said\r\nthat she was sure he would not fail, but soon bring back good news.\r\n\r\nAs we were all on the look-out for Fritz, we saw his boat a long way\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"There is no one with him in the boat,\" said I to my wife; \"that does\r\nnot say much for our hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, where have you been?\" said the boys, all at once, as he came on\r\nboard. But they scarce got a word from him. He then drew me on one side,\r\nand said, with a smile of joy, \"What do you think is the news I bring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me hear it,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Then I have found what I went forth to seek, and our search has not\r\nbeen in vain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is it that you have found?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a man,\" he said, \"but a girl. The dress she wears is that of a man,\r\nand she does not wish at first that her sex should be known to more that\r\nwe can help, for she would not like to meet Ernest and the rest in that\r\nstate, if they knew that she was a girl. And, strange to tell,\" said\r\nFritz, \"she has been on shore three years.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I went to tell the news to my wife, Fritz had gone down to his\r\nberth to change his clothes, and I must say that he took more care to\r\nlook neat in his dress than was his wont at home.\r\n\r\nHe was not long, and when he came on deck he bid me say no word to the\r\nrest of whom he had found. He leaped like a frog in to his light craft,\r\nand led the way. We were soon on our course through the rocks and\r\nshoals, and an hour's sail, with the aid of a good breeze, brought us to\r\na small tract of land, the trees of which hid the soil from our view.\r\n\r\nHere we got close in to the shore, and made our bark safe. We all got\r\nout, and ran up the banks, led by the marks that Fritz had made in the\r\nsoil with his feet. We soon found a path that led to a clump of trees,\r\nand there saw a hut, with a fire in front, from which rose a stream of\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near I could see that the boys did not know what to make of\r\nit, for they gave me a stare, as if to ask what they were to see next.\r\nThey did not know how to give vent to their joy when they saw Fritz come\r\nout of the hut with a strange youth, whose slight make, fair face, and\r\ngrace of form, did not seem to match well with the clothes that hung\r\nupon his limbs.\r\n\r\nIt was so long since we had seen a strange face, that we were all loth\r\nto speak first. When I could gain my speech I took our new friend by the\r\nhand, and told her in words as kind as I could call to my aid, how, glad\r\nwe were to have thus found her.\r\n\r\nFritz, when he bade Ernest and Jack shake bands with her, spoke of our\r\nnew friend as James, but she could not hide her sex from my wife, for\r\nher first act was to fall on her breast and weep. The boys were not slow\r\nto see through the trick, and made Fritz tell them that \"James\" was not\r\nthe name they should call her by.\r\n\r\nI could not but note that our strange mode of life had made my sons\r\nrough, and that years of rude toil had worn off that grace and ease\r\nwhich is one of the charms of well-bred youth.\r\n\r\nI saw that this made the girl shy of them, and that the garb she wore\r\nbrought a blush to her cheek. I bade my wife take charge of her, and\r\nlead her down to the boat, while the boys and I stood a while to speak\r\nof our fair guest.\r\n\r\nWhen we got on board we sat down to hear Fritz tell how he came to find\r\nMiss Jane, for that was her real name; but he had not told half his tale\r\nwhen he saw my wife and her new friend come up on deck. She still had a\r\nshy look, but as soon as she saw Fritz she held out her hand to him with\r\na smile, and this made us feel more at our ease.\r\n\r\nThe next day we were to go back to our home, and on the way Fritz was to\r\ntell us what he knew of Miss Jane, for his tale had been cut short when\r\nshe came on the deck with my wife. The boys did all they could to make\r\nher feel at home with them, and by the end of the day they were the best\r\nof friends.\r\n\r\nThe next day we set sail at sun rise; for we had far to go, and the boys\r\nhad a strange wish to hear Fritz tell his tale.\r\n\r\nWhen the boat had made a fair start, we all sat down on the deck, with\r\nJane in our midst, while Fritz told his tale to the end.\r\n\r\nJane Rose was born in IN-DI-A. She was the child of one Cap-tain Rose,\r\nwhose wife died when Jane was but a babe in arms. When ten years of age\r\nhe sent her to a first class school, where she was taught all that was\r\nfit for the child of a rich man to know. In course of time she could\r\nride a horse with some skill, and she then grew fond of most of the\r\nfield sports of the East. As the Captain had to go from place to place\r\nwith his troops, he thought that this kind of sport would train her for\r\nthe mode of life she would lead when she came to live with him. But this\r\nwas not to be, for one day he told Jane that he must leave the East,\r\nand take home the troops. As it was a rule that no girl should sail in\r\na ship with troops on board, he left her to the care of a friend who was\r\nto leave near the same time. He thought fit that she should dress in the\r\ngarb of a young man while at sea, as there would then be no need for\r\nher to keep in her berth, and he knew that she was strong and brave, and\r\nwould like to go on deck, and see the crew at their work. It gave the\r\nCaptain pain to part with his child, but there was, no help for it.\r\n\r\nThe ship had been some weeks at sea, when one day a storm broke over\r\nit, and the wind drove it for days out of its course. The crew did their\r\nbest to steer clear of the rocks, but she struck on a reef and sprung a\r\nleak. The boats then put off from the wreck, but a wave broke over the\r\none in which Jane left, and she was borne, half dead with fright, to the\r\nplace where we found her. She had been thrown high up on the beach, and\r\nthough faint and sick, got out of the reach of the waves. She did not\r\nknow if those who were in the boat with her had lost their lives, but\r\nshe had seen no trace of them since.\r\n\r\nWhen she had strength to walk, she found some birds' eggs and shell\r\nfish, which she ate, and then went in search of some safe place where\r\nshe could rest for the night. By good chance she had a flint and a\r\nknife; with these she set light to some dry twigs, and made a fire,\r\nwhich she did not once let out till the day she left. Her life was at\r\nfirst hard to bear, but she was full of hope that some day a ship would\r\ncome near the shore, to which she could make signs for help. The wild\r\nsports of the East in which she took part had made her strong of limb,\r\nand she had been taught to make light of such things as would vex most\r\nof her sex.\r\n\r\nShe built a hut to sleep in, and made snares to catch birds. Some of\r\nthem she made use of for food, and some she let go with bits of cloth\r\ntied to their legs, on which she wrote words, in the hope that they\r\nmight meet the eye of some one who could help her. This, as we knew, had\r\nled Fritz to make his search, the end of which had brought as much joy\r\nto us as to the young friend who now sat in our midst.\r\n\r\nWhen Fritz had told us this, and much more, we came in sight of Safe\r\nBay. He then took Ernest with him in his small boat, and left us to go\r\nup the stream as fast as he could to Rock House, so as to make the place\r\nlook neat by the time we brought home our guest. The two boys--for to us\r\nthey were still boys--met us on the beach. Fritz, with a look of pride,\r\ngave his hand to Jane, and I could see a slight blush rise to her cheek\r\nas she gave him hers. He then led her up the path, on each side of which\r\ngrew a row of young trees, and took her to a seat in our grounds. There\r\nhe and Ernest had spread out a feast of our best food--fish, fowls, and\r\nfruit, and some of my wife's choice jam--whilst our burnt clay plate\r\nmade a great show on the board, for it was set out with some taste. We\r\nhad a wish to show Jane that, though the coast was a wild kind of place,\r\nstill there were means to make life a joy to those who dwelt on it, if\r\nthey chose to use them. As for Jane, the sight of our home, the style\r\nof our feast, and the kind words of the boys, were things so new to her,\r\nthat she knew not what to say.\r\n\r\n\"I shall tell no more than the truth,\" she said, \"when I say that what\r\nyou have shown me is of far more worth than all the wealth I have seen\r\nin the East, and that I feel more joy this day than I have felt in all\r\nthe days of my life. I can use no terms less strong than these to show\r\nhow much I thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThis was just the kind of speech to please the boys, for there had been\r\nno one to praise their work till now. When the meal was done, my wife\r\nbrought out some of her best wine, and we drank to the health of our\r\nguest in great state, and with loud cheers. We then made a tour of our\r\nhouse and grounds, that Jane might see the whole of the place that from\r\nthis time she was to make her home. It would take me a long time to tell\r\nwhat she thought of all she saw, or the neat things she said in praise\r\nof our skill, as we took her from place to place. My wife's room, in\r\nwhich were kept the pots and pans to dress our food, and the plates,\r\nbowls, and cups, out of which we ate, took her some time to view; for\r\nshe had long felt the want of such things as she now saw we had made for\r\nour own use out of what we could find.\r\n\r\nThe next day we all went to The Nest, and when the rainy season came\r\nround, Jane knew the place quite as well as we did. My wife found in\r\nher a true friend, for she soon took a large share of the work off\r\nher hands, and did it with so much skill, and with so strong a wish to\r\nplease us, that we grew to love her as if she had been our own child.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for us to keep in doors from the rain, the boys would\r\noft lay by their work, and sit to hear Jane talk of what she had seen in\r\nthe East, and Ernest and Fritz would read to her by turns such books as\r\nshe might choose. I was glad to see that this wrought a great change in\r\nmy sons, whose mode of life had made them rough in their ways and loud\r\nin their speech--faults which we did not think of so long as there was\r\nno one to see or hear them.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring came, the boys went in our boat to the spot where they\r\nhad found Jane, which we now knew by the name of \"Jane's Isle,\" and\r\nbrought back some beans, which were new to them. These we found to be\r\nCOF-FEE. Jane told us that they were by no means scarce, but that she\r\nhad not made use of them, as she knew no way to roast or grind the\r\nbeans, which she found in a green state.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think,\" said my wife, \"that the plant would grow here?\"\r\n\r\nI then thought for the first time how fond she was of it. There had been\r\nsome bags on board the ship, but I had not brought them from the wreck;\r\nand my wife had once said that she would like to see the plant in our\r\nground. Now that we knew where to get it, she told me that it was one of\r\nthe few things that she felt the loss of. When the boys heard this, they\r\nset out on a trip to Jane's Isle, and while there they went to the spot\r\nwhere she had dwelt for so long, and sought for what things she had left\r\nwhen she came to live with us.\r\n\r\nAll these were brought to Rock, House, and I may tell you that Fritz set\r\ngreat store by them. There were all sorts of odd clothes, which she had\r\nmade of the skin of the sea calf; fish lines wrought out of the hair of\r\nher head; pins made from the bones of fish; a lamp made out of a shell,\r\nwith a wick of the threads which she had drawn from her hose. There were\r\nthe shells she used to cook her food in; a hat made from the breast of a\r\nlarge bird, the tail of which she had spread out so as to shade her neck\r\nfrom the sun; belts, shoes, and odd things of a like kind.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who had now a friend of her own sex to talk with, did not feel\r\ndull when the boys left us for a time, so they had leave to roam where\r\ntheir wish led them, and to stay as long as they chose. In the course\r\nof time they knew the whole of the isle on which we dwelt. Ernest drew\r\na map of it to scale, so that we could trace their course from place\r\nto place with ease. When they went for a long trip they took some doves\r\nwith them, and these birds brought us notes tied to their wings from\r\ntime to time, so that we knew where they were, and could point out the\r\nspot on the map.\r\n\r\nI will not dwell on what took place now for some time, for I find that\r\neach year was very much like the last. We had our fields to sow, our\r\ncrops to reap, our beasts to feed and train; and these cares kept our\r\nhands at work, and our minds free from the least thought of our lone\r\nmode of life.\r\n\r\nI turn to my log as I write this, and on each page my eye falls on some\r\nthing that brings back to my mind the glad time we spent at Rock House.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nIN the spring time of the year, when the rain was past, Fritz and Jack\r\nset off on a trip in their boat to Shark Isle. The day was fine, the sky\r\nclear, and there was no wind, yet the waves rose and fell as in a storm.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" cried Jack, \"here comes a shoal of whales. They will eat us up.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no fear of that,\" said Fritz; \"whales will do us no harm, if\r\nwe do not touch them.\" This proved to be the case. Though any one of\r\nthem might have broken up the boat with a stroke of its tail, they did\r\nnot touch it, but swam by in a line, two by two, like a file of troops.\r\n\r\nOn Shark Isle, near the shore, we had thrown up a mound, and built a\r\nfort, on which were set two of the ship's guns. These the boys made a\r\nrule to fire off, with a view to let us know that they were safe, and\r\nto try if the guns were still fit for use. This time they found their\r\ncharge quite dry, and the guns went off with a loud bang.\r\n\r\nThey had just put a plug in the hole of one of the guns, to keep out the\r\nwet, when they heard a sound roll through the air.\r\n\r\n\"Did you bear that?\" said Jack. \"I am sure that noise must have come\r\nfrom some ship at sea. Let us fire once more.\"\r\n\r\nBut Fritz thought they ought to go home at once and tell me what they\r\nhad heard. They both ran to the boat with all speed, and put out their\r\nstrength to reach home ere the sun went down.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine, and as the rain had kept us in doors for two months,\r\nwe were glad to go down on the beach for a change. All at once I saw\r\nthe boys come up the stream in their boat, at a great speed, and the way\r\nthey used their sculls led me to think that all was not right.\r\n\r\n\"What have you seen, that should thus put two brave youths to flight?\"\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\nThen they told me what had brought them back so soon. I had heard the\r\nsound of the two guns which they had fired off, but no more. I told\r\nthem I thought their ears must be at fault, and that the sounds they\r\nhad heard were no more than those of their own guns, which the hills had\r\nsent back through the air. This view of the case did not at all please\r\nthem, as by this time they well knew what sounds their guns made.\r\n\r\n\"It will be a strange thing,\" said I, \"if the hope to which I have so\r\nlong clung should at last come to be a fact; but we must have a care\r\nthat we do not hail a ship the crew of which may rob and kill us for the\r\nsake of our wealth. I feel that we have as much cause to dread a foe as\r\nwe have grounds of hope that we may meet with friends.\"\r\n\r\nOur first course was to make the cave quite safe, and then to mount\r\nguard where we could see a ship if one should come near the coast. That\r\nnight the rain came down in a flood, and a storm broke over us, and we\r\nwere thus kept in doors for two days and two nights.\r\n\r\nOn the third day I set out with Jack to Shark Isle, with a view to seek\r\nfor the strange ship which he said he knew must be in some place not\r\nfar from the coast. I went to the top of a high rock, but though my eye\r\nswept the sea for miles round, I could see no signs of a sail. I then\r\nmade Jack fire three more shots, to try if they would give the same\r\nsound as the two boys had heard. You may judge how I felt, when I heard\r\none! two! three! boom through the air.\r\n\r\nThere was now no room for doubt that, though I could not see it, there\r\nmust be a ship near Shark's Isle. Jack heard me say this with great\r\nglee, and cried out, \"What can we now do to find it?\"\r\n\r\nWe had brought a flag with us, and I told Jack to haul this up twice to\r\nthe top of the staff, by means of which sign those who saw it would know\r\nthat we had good news to tell them.\r\n\r\nI then left Jack on the fort with the guns, and told him to fire as soon\r\nas a ship hove in sight. I bent my way at once back to Rock House, to\r\ntalk with my wife, Jane, and the boys, as to what steps we should now\r\ntake. They all met me on the beach, and made me tell them the news while\r\nI was still in the boat.\r\n\r\n\"We know no more,\" said I, \"than the fact that there is still a ship\r\non the coast. You must all now keep in doors, while Fritz and I go in\r\nsearch of it.\"\r\n\r\nWe set off at noon, and went straight to the west part of the coast,\r\nwhere we thought the sound must have come from. We knew a cape there\r\nfrom which we could get a good view of the sea, and by the side of which\r\nlay a small bay.\r\n\r\nWhen we got round the cape, great was our joy to find a fine ship in\r\nthe bay. It was not far off from us, for we could see the ENG-LISH flag\r\nfloat in the breeze from one of its masts. I seek in vain to find words\r\nby means of which I can set forth in print what I then felt. Both Fritz\r\nand I fell on our knees and gave thanks to God that He had thus led the\r\nship to our coast. If I had not held him back, Fritz would have gone\r\ninto the sea with a leap and swum off to the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said I, \"till we are quite sure what they are. There are bad men\r\non the seas who put up false flags to lure ships out of their course,\r\nand then rob and kill the crew.\"\r\n\r\nWe could now see all that took place on board. Two tents had been set\r\nup on the shore, in front of which was a fire; and we could see that\r\nmen went to and fro with planks. There were two men left on guard on\r\nthe deck of the ship, and to these we made signs. When they saw us they\r\nspoke to some one who stood near, and whom we thought had charge of the\r\nship. He then put his glass up to his eye and took a good view of us\r\nthrough it.\r\n\r\nWe did not at first like to go too near, but kept our boat some way off.\r\nFritz said he could see that the faces of the men were not so dark as\r\nour own.\r\n\r\n\"If that be the case,\" said I, \"we are safe, and we may trust their\r\nflag.\"\r\n\r\nWe both sang a Swiss song, and then I cried out at the top of my voice\r\nthese words: \"Ship ahoy! good men!\" But they made no sign that they\r\nheard us. Our song, our boat, and, more than all, our dress, made them\r\nno doubt guess that we were wild men of the wood; for at last one of\r\nthe crew on board held up knives and glass beads, which I knew the wild\r\ntribes of the New World were fond of. This made us laugh, but we would\r\nnot as yet draw nigh to the ship, as we thought we ought to meet our new\r\nfriends in our best trim.\r\n\r\nWe then gave a shout and a wave of the hand, and shot off round the cape\r\nas fast as our boat would take us. We soon got back to Rock House, where\r\nour dear ones were on the look-out for us. My wife said we had done\r\nquite right to come back, but Jane thought we should have found out who\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\nThat night none of us slept well; our guest thought there might now be\r\na chance for her to reach her home, and she dreamed she heard the\r\nwell-known voice of her sire call her to come to him. The boys were half\r\ncrazed with vague hopes, and lay for hours ere they went to sleep. My\r\nwife and I sat up late to think and talk of the use that might be made\r\nof this chance. We felt that we were now full of years, and should not\r\nlike in our old age to leave the place where we had spent the best part\r\nof our lives; still we might do some trade with the land from which the\r\nship came, if it were but known that we were here, and we might hear\r\nnews of our dear Swiss home.\r\n\r\nAt break of day we put on board our boat a stock of fruit and fresh\r\nfood of all kinds, such as we thought the crew of the ship would like to\r\nhave, and Fritz and I set sail for the bay. We took with us all the arms\r\nwe could find, so as not to be at a loss should the crew prove false to\r\ntheir flag, and turn out to be a set of thieves.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the ship I fired a gun, and told Fritz to hoist a flag\r\nlike theirs to the top of our mast, and as we did so the crew gave a\r\nloud cheer. I then went on board, and the mate of the ship led me to his\r\nchief, who soon put me at my ease by a frank shake of the hand. I then\r\ntold him who we were, and how we came to dwell on the isle. I learned\r\nfrom him, in turn, that he was bound for New South Wales; that he knew\r\nCaptain Rose, who had lost his child, and that he had made a search for\r\nher on the coast. He told me that a storm had thrown him off his course,\r\nand that the wind drove him on this coast, where he took care to fill\r\nhis casks from a fresh stream that ran by the side of a hill, and to\r\ntake in a stock of wood.\r\n\r\n\"It was then,\" he said, \"that we first heard your guns; and when on the\r\nthird day the same sound came to our ears, we knew that there must be\r\nsome one on the coast, and this led us to put up our tents and wait till\r\nthe crew should search the land round the bay.\"\r\n\r\nI then made the crew a gift of what we had brought in our boat, and said\r\nto Captain Stone, for that was his name: \"I hope, sir, that you will now\r\ngo with me to Rock House, the place where we live, and where you will\r\nsee Miss Rose, who will be glad to hear some news of home.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure I will, and thank you much,\" said he; \"and I have no doubt\r\nthat Mr. West would like to go with us.\" This Mr. West was on his way,\r\nwith his wife and two girls, to New South Wales, where he meant to build\r\na house and clear a piece of land.\r\n\r\nWe all three then left the ship in our boat, and as we came in sight of\r\nShark Isle, Jack, who was on the fort, fired his guns.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the beach, my wife and the rest were there to meet\r\nus. Jane was half wild with joy when she heard that Captain Stone had\r\nbrought her good news from home.\r\n\r\nWe led them round our house and through the grounds and Mr. West took\r\nnote of all he saw. When we came to talk, I found that he had made up\r\nhis mind to stay with us. I need not say how glad I was to hear this,\r\nfor he had brought out with him a large stock of farm tools, of which we\r\nhad long been in want.\r\n\r\nThe boys were of course in high glee at all this, but I did not share\r\ntheir joy so much as I could wish. The ship which now lay close to our\r\nshore was the first we had seen since we came to the isle, and no one\r\ncould tell when the next might come. My wife and I did not wish to\r\nleave. I had a love for the kind of life we led, and we were both at an\r\nage when ease and rest should take the place of toil. But then our sons\r\nwere young--not yet in the prime of life--and I did not think it right\r\nthat we should keep them from the world. Jane, I could tell, would not\r\nstay with us, nor did she hide from us the fact that her heart drew her\r\nto the dear one at home, from whom she had been kept so long. So I told\r\nmy wife that I would ask my boys to choose what they would do--to stay\r\nwith us on the isle, or leave with Captain Stone in the ship.\r\n\r\nFritz and Jack said they would not leave us; Ernest spoke not a word,\r\nbut I saw that he had made up his mind to go. I did not grieve at this,\r\nas I felt that our isle was too small for the scope of his mind, and did\r\nnot give him the means to learn all he could wish. I told him to speak\r\nout, when he said he should like to leave the place for a few years, and\r\nhe knew Frank had a wish to go with him.\r\n\r\nI thought this would give my wife pain, but she said that the boys had\r\nmade a good choice, and that she knew Ernest and Frank would make their\r\nway in the world.\r\n\r\nCaptain Stone gave Jane, Ernest, and Frank leave to go with him, as\r\nthere was room in the ship now that the Wests were to stay with us.\r\n\r\nThe ship was brought round to Safe Bay, and Fritz and Jack went on board\r\nto fetch Mrs. West and her two girls, who were glad to find that they\r\nwere not to go back to the ship, for the storm had made them dread the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nI may here say, by the way, that my wife soon found that her two sons\r\ngrew fond of their fair friends, and gave me a hint that some day we\r\nshould see them wed, which would be a fresh source of joy to us.\r\n\r\nI have not much more to tell. The stores I had laid up--furs, pearls,\r\nspice, and fruits--were put on board the ship, and left to the care of\r\nmy sons, who were to sell them. And then the time came for us to part. I\r\nneed not say that it was a hard trial for my wife; but she bore up well,\r\nfor she had made up her mind that it was all for the best, and that her\r\nsons would some day come back to see her. I felt, too, that with the\r\nhelp of our new friends, we should not miss them so much as we at first\r\nthought, and this we found to be the case.\r\n\r\nAs the next day my boys were to leave me, I had a long talk with them. I\r\ntold them to act well their part in the new sphere in which they were to\r\nmove, and to take as their guide the Word of God. They then knelt down\r\nfor me to bless them, and went to their beds in Rock House for the last\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI got no sleep all that night, nor did the two boys, who were to start\r\nthe next day.\r\n\r\nAs Ernest takes this Tale with him--which I gave him leave to print,\r\nthat all may know how good God has been to us--I have no time to add\r\nmore than a few words.\r\n\r\nThe ship that is to take from us our two sons and our fair guest will\r\nsail from this coast in a few hours, and by the close of the day three\r\nwho are dear to us will have gone from our midst. I can not put down\r\nwhat I feel, or tell the grief of my poor wife.\r\n\r\nI add these lines while the boat waits for my sons. May God grant them\r\nhealth and strength for the trials they may have to pass through; may\r\nthey gain the love of those with whom they are now to dwell; and may\r\nthey keep free from taint the good name of the Swiss Family Robinson.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
