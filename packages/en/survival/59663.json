KORINEK, V. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOG REGULATOR AND TONIC.\r\n\r\nNux Vomica, one pound; Hardwood Charcoal, two pounds; Sulphur, two\r\npounds; Common Salt, three pounds; Sulphide of Antimony, one and one-half\r\npounds; Glauber Salts, two pounds; Bicarbonate of Soda, four pounds;\r\nHyposulphite of Soda, four pounds; Nitrate of Potash, one pound; Quassia,\r\none-half pound; Gentian Root, one pound; Iron Sulphate, one pound;\r\npulverize and mix well.\r\n\r\nTo every one hundred pounds of hog weight, give one tablespoonful in\r\nfeed or swill once or twice daily. For hogs weighing two hundred pounds,\r\nthe dose would be two tablespoonfuls; for a hog weighing fifty pounds,\r\none-half tablespoonful.\r\n\r\nHogs, like other animals, require tonics, bowel regulators and worm\r\nexpellers. For these purposes, I have prescribed under a number of the\r\ndiseases of hogs, which I cover in this chapter, the above general\r\ntonic and regulator which I have used in my personal practice with\r\nmarked success, especially serving the purpose of aiding hogs in the\r\nconvalescence from debilitating diseases and in their recovery from a\r\ngeneral run-down condition.\r\n\r\nAside from its general tonic and regulative effect, this prescription\r\ncontains nerve tonics, intestinal antiseptics, laxatives, worm expellers,\r\nand aids digestion, etc.\r\n\r\nIf regularly given to hogs, and sanitary conditions are maintained,\r\nthis tonic and regulator will largely fortify them against contagious\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Sows may abort at any state of pregnancy by slipping, falling,\r\nreceiving kicks, or by being caught while crawling through or under\r\nfences. Sows may also abort when allowed to crawl into quarters\r\nwhere there are other hogs. Contagious diseases, such as Cholera and\r\nPleuropneumonia also produce abortion. There is also a contagious form of\r\nabortion in sows, but this is very uncommon, as the disease spreads very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—There is no warning given, as a rule; the sows expel their pigs\r\nbefore any signs of abortion are noticed.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the sows refuse to eat, become uneasy, shivering and\r\ntrembling of the muscles, and straining or labor pains are noticed. As\r\na rule, when a sow aborts, she will not prepare a bed, as she would\r\nnormally.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive is the only safe and sure treatment, although\r\nwhen the first signs of abortion appear, and there are no signs of the\r\nmembranes coming away, remove the sow to quiet, warm, clean quarters\r\nby herself, and if straining, give one dram of Chloral-Hydrate in her\r\ndrinking water every two or three hours.\r\n\r\nWhen a sow aborts, burn the pigs and afterbirth, and disinfect the pens\r\nwith a Coal Tar disinfectant. Keep this up for several days, and do not\r\nbreed until all discharges from the vagina have ceased flowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINE TO HOGS.\r\n\r\nTo administer medicine to hogs may seem easy, but, nevertheless, it is a\r\ndifficult task. Never lay a hog on his back to drench him, as in so doing\r\nthere is great danger of strangling. The proper method is to stand or set\r\nhim on end, holding him up by the ears, and by the use of a bottle with a\r\npiece of hose drawn over its neck, give the medicine very slowly, so as\r\nnot to allow a large quantity to accumulate in the mouth or throat at\r\none time. There is always danger of some of the liquid escaping into the\r\nlungs and causing the hog to strangle, and thus it may produce pneumonia.\r\nHowever, this is the best method of giving hogs medicine by force.\r\n\r\nHogs will generally take medicine in their feed or drinking water, unless\r\nthey are very sick, or the medicine is extremely disagreeable to the\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAG INFLAMMATION.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Injuries, obstructed teats, accumulation of milk in the sow’s bag\r\nafter the loss of part or all of her litter. Difficult birth, slight\r\nwounds in the bag permit invasion of germs, which is frequently the\r\ncommon cause of bag inflammation.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Heat, pain and swelling in one or more teats. The general body\r\ntemperature is elevated one or two degrees above normal. The sow perhaps\r\nrefuses her feed, although she will drink water in large quantities.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Feed soft, sloppy food and vegetables. Give Epsom Salts, two\r\nto four ounces, in milk or feed. It is also well to milk the sow by\r\nhand, relieving her of the milk three or four times a day. This is very\r\nnecessary. Camphorated Oil is very soothing, and I would recommend its\r\nuse freely over affected teats.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK TOOTH.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Black Tooth, so called in swine, is principally due to injuries\r\nto the teeth received by chewing hard matter, such as bone, etc., which\r\ncauses them to decay.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Toothache. Toothache in swine is similar to that exhibited by\r\nman, in showing loss of appetite, salivation, or slobbering, hanging\r\nthe head mostly to the side which is affected, loss of fear of man,\r\nand offensive breath. If the hogs are fed on strongly acid food for any\r\nlength of time, their teeth may become dark colored. As the teeth are not\r\nmaterially injured, so long as decayed tooth substance cannot be noticed,\r\nand while the appetite and chewing facilities of the hog do not appear to\r\nbe diminished, no interference will be necessary.\r\n\r\nIt is customary with some people to examine the teeth of hogs, and if\r\none tooth is found darker colored than the others, it is supposed to be\r\nthe cause of the hog not doing well, if he is in poor condition, and\r\nthe tooth is hammered off flush with the jaw, leaving the broken roots,\r\nlacerated gums and nerves to increase the hog’s suffering. If the hog\r\nrecovers, it is often concluded that this was a case of Black Tooth.\r\n\r\nMy advice is, if you are determined to have the tooth out, extract it\r\nproperly. Do not break it off. When your hogs are not thriving, give them\r\nthe regulator and tonic prescribed on the first page of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOOD POISONING.\r\n\r\n(_Pyemia Septicemia_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to the toxic substance produced by germs that invade wounds,\r\nbruises, abscesses, or womb following farrowing, if lacerated.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The seat of injury becomes swollen, pus may adhere to the hair,\r\ntemperature elevated, appetite poor, hog moves about very slowly, becomes\r\nseparated from the rest of the drove, lies around in some cool, quiet\r\nplace, eventually becomes very weak and poor and dies, if good attention\r\nis not given.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Separate from the other hogs and remove to a clean,\r\ncomfortable place and wash the seat of injury with some good\r\ndisinfectant, as a five per cent Carbolic Acid solution. In cases of\r\nabscess, open it low so as to assure good drainage. Keep clean, cool\r\nwater before your hogs at all times. Give mashes made from wheat bran\r\nand hot water, or any good substantial food that is easily digested\r\ncontaining regulator and tonic prescribed on the first page of this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Lung worms, poorly ventilated sleeping quarters, sleeping in straw\r\nstacks, in manure heaps, over-heated, filthy pens, where the animals\r\ninhale irritating gases given off the bodies of other hogs, and from\r\nfilth. Smoke and dust are very common producers of bronchitis.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Breathing fast, appetite poor, slight rise in temperature and\r\ncoughing. The hog is dull and stupid, refuses food, but drinks water\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive; avoid the above named causes, but when hogs become\r\naffected, move them to clean, well ventilated quarters, avoiding dust and\r\ngases, disinfect bedding and floors with some good disinfectant, as Crude\r\nCarbolic Acid, sprayed. Also give large doses of the hog regulator and\r\ntonic as prescribed on the first page of this chapter. Feed vegetables,\r\nor any easily digested food, and hot wheat bran mashes.\r\n\r\nIn case the disease is due to lung worms, confine the animals in a closed\r\nshed and permit them to inhale the steam from Turpentine and water for\r\na few minutes, by placing water and Turpentine in a tin receptacle\r\nholding about two gallons, and inserting heated bricks or stones into the\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION.\r\n\r\nThis is generally understood by every stockraiser, yet there are some\r\npoints many do not know. For instance, you should use in this operation\r\nan antiseptic solution, as Carbolic Acid or Bichloride of Mercury.\r\nWash thoroughly with antiseptic your hands and knife, also the seat of\r\noperation and make your incision as low as possible to permit the pus to\r\ndrain out nicely. If this is not practiced, the pus will become absorbed\r\ninto the blood, producing blood poison, which may produce death, or at\r\nthe best will cause the hog to become stunted, whereas, if the operation\r\nis performed properly, the hog will thrive, regardless of the shock from\r\nthe operation. I may add that it is much better to castrate pigs or\r\nhogs when their stomachs or intestines are empty, and it is always good\r\npractice to feed laxative and easily digested foods sparingly after this\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOKING.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Vegetables such as potatoes, etc., roots, as carrots, turnips and\r\nsometimes pieces of bone or glass, lodge in the gullet. Paralysis of the\r\nmuscular fibres of the gullet is a very common cause of choking in swine.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The hog is unable to swallow, producing a frothing at the mouth\r\nand, if the obstruction cannot be dislodged, death occurs in a very\r\nshort time. Sometimes the obstruction in the gullet may be felt from the\r\noutside with the hand.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The administration of small doses of Raw Linseed or Olive\r\nOil, or Lard, will assist in dislodging the obstruction. Also careful\r\nmanipulation of the gullet from the outside with the hand assists in\r\neither forcing it into the stomach or bringing it out through hog’s\r\nmouth. If vomiting can be produced, it will dislodge the obstruction. If\r\nimmediate results are not obtained from the above treatments, I would\r\nrecommend butchering the hog for meat immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD IN THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n(_Nasal Catarrh_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Exposure to cold; a very common condition in cold, wet weather\r\nwhen hogs are allowed to sleep in manure heaps, straw stacks, or pile up\r\ntogether, when they become over-heated and later chill. Nasal Catarrh may\r\nalso be due to inhaling dust or irritating gases.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The animal is stupid and feverish, coughing and sneezing\r\nfrequently; appetite is poor, eyes watery and inflamed; a discharge\r\nof mucus from the nose will terminate in yellow pus and the nose, if\r\nexamined, is found to be inflamed and ulcerated.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The best and safest treatment is to provide clean sleeping\r\nquarters, avoid overcrowding in dusty, dirty sheds, especially during\r\ncold weather. Pigs affected with cold in the head should be fed on\r\nlaxative food, such as boiled carrots, potatoes, apples, hot wheat bran\r\nmashes and steamed rolled oats.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—Confine the affected hogs to a shed, close windows and\r\ndoors and any large cracks; then compel them to inhale steam from the\r\nfollowing mixture: Turpentine, eight ounces; Pine Tar, one pint; Water,\r\ntwo gallons. Place in tin receptacle in center of shed and heat the above\r\nsolution by adding hot bricks or stones to the mixture occasionally.\r\nCompel the hogs to inhale this steam for at least thirty minutes twice\r\na day. Give chlorate of Potash in twenty grain doses three times a day\r\nin feed or drinking water. This treatment is very successful if the\r\ninflammation has not extended to the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA IN YOUNG PIGS.\r\n\r\n(_Scours_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Decomposed foods, slops, etc., fed to the mothers, causing them\r\nto give toxic milk. Poorly ventilated, filthy, cold and damp pens,\r\ninsufficient exercise, lack of sunlight, raising pigs by hand or with\r\nother sow.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Frequent movement of the bowels, the passage being of a\r\ngrayish-white color and the odor very disagreeable. At this stage of the\r\ndisease, reliable remedies must be given or the pig will die very soon.\r\n\r\nThe discharge from the bowels becomes very thin, the tail and legs become\r\nsoiled, loss of appetite, the pigs become weak and dull, hair rough and\r\nit is difficult for them to move about. In very young pigs, treatment is\r\nof little value.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—As Scours in pigs is a disease frequently caused by faulty\r\nfood and insanitary surroundings, a preventive treatment is of great\r\nimportance, and much better results are thus obtained than by the use\r\nof medical agents. Medical treatment consists in first cleaning away\r\nthe irritant present in the bowels. For this purpose give one to two\r\nteaspoonfuls of Castor Oil. At the time of farrowing all sows should\r\nreceive a light diet and be kept in clean, dry quarters. The pigs should\r\nbe allowed pure air, sunshine and exercise. If the sow appears hot and\r\nfeverish, give one to three ounces of Castor Oil in milk or swill. Avoid\r\nfeeding decomposed, moldy food, or sour milk. To check the diarrhoea in\r\npigs, use the following after the irritant is removed or cleaned out as\r\nabove stated: Zinc Sulphocarbolates, thirty grains; Protan, two ounces;\r\nPulv. Gentian Root, two ounces. Make into sixty capsules or powders and\r\ngive one, three or four times a day. The sow should receive a dose about\r\neight times the size of that of the pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOG CHOLERA.\r\n\r\n(_Swine Fever_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—By the Bacillus Sius; contaminated food, stagnant water, filth,\r\netc., all have a tendency to aid its progress. I have seen farms,\r\nalthough located in sections where Cholera was prevalent, not in the\r\nleast troubled with the malady, perhaps due to careful feeding of\r\nclean foods, care in watering, cleanliness about the pens and sheds\r\nand disinfecting occasionally, but no doubt a better explanation is\r\nthat those hogs received tonics, containing worm expellers, at least\r\nfour times a year. Many a case of supposed Hog Cholera is due to worms\r\nirritating and producing inflammation of the intestines, followed by\r\ndiarrhoea. A person not familiar with the disease calls this “hog\r\ncholera.” In other cases, hogs which are fed swills from restaurants,\r\nhotels, etc., containing soap, washing powders, small particles of glass,\r\netc., will die with symptoms leading a person to think they had Hog\r\nCholera, but if a thorough investigation is made the true cause of death\r\ncan easily be discovered.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—In true Hog Cholera, the temperature will be elevated two to\r\nfour degrees above normal. There will be a loss of appetite, vomiting,\r\ndiarrhoea, although there may be constipation when the hog is first\r\naffected. The hog wanders off by itself to some cool, quiet place and\r\nlies down. When it walks it will stagger and show great stiffness in\r\nits hind parts, due to soreness of the intestines. The hair will have a\r\nroughened appearance, the back arched, the eyes inflamed and discharging\r\npus, red blotches will show themselves back of the ears, inside the legs\r\nand on the abdomen. At this stage the diarrhoea is watery, dark and\r\ntinged with blood, and very offensive in odor, breathing is very fast and\r\nlabored. The hog grows very weak and dies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Prevention must always be borne in mind. Do not feed filthy\r\nfood. Always feed good, wholesome food, and give clean water to drink.\r\nWatch the condition of hog’s bowels and regulate them by feeding. Burn\r\nmanure and bedding and disinfect carefully. Do not permit your hogs to\r\ndrink out of running streams of water, especially if Hog Cholera is in\r\nyour neighborhood. When buying hogs, it is well to keep them off by\r\nthemselves for two or three weeks, as they may be diseased. Do not\r\npermit neighbors, their stock or dogs on premises when Hog Cholera is\r\nraging, as the infection of Hog Cholera can be spread very rapidly by\r\nmatter from the affected hogs adhering to the shoes of man, to the feet\r\nof stock and hogs, etc.\r\n\r\nI am positive that if this method were properly practiced by all hog\r\nraisers and feeders, Hog Cholera would be a very rare disease.\r\n\r\nSERUM TREATMENT.—This is successful in some cases, and in others\r\nunsuccessful. The latter perhaps is due to poor serums, or the disease\r\nbeing so far advanced in its progress that the hogs are beyond recovery.\r\nSerum treatment is very expensive and, as it requires a strictly septic\r\noperation of injecting the serum, the average hog raiser or grower is\r\nnot qualified to administer the treatment properly. An additional and\r\nnecessary expense is the services of a Veterinary Surgeon. Therefore, I\r\nstrongly urge adoption of preventive measures as stated. Use some good\r\ndisinfectant, such as Crude Carbolic Acid, which destroys the Bacillus\r\nof Hog Cholera. Also administer hog regulator and tonic as prescribed\r\non first page of this chapter. This will expel worms, tone the system,\r\nregulate the bowels and fortify your hogs against Hog Cholera.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Worms are perhaps one of the most common causes. Unwholesome,\r\nirritating food or swill containing soap or washing powder have a\r\ntendency to derange the process of digestion.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Abdominal pain, vomiting, back arched, breathing rapid and\r\ntemperature elevated from two to three degrees. There may be diarrhoea\r\nor the animal may be constipated. Vomiting, as a rule, relieves acute\r\nattacks by expelling the irritant from the bowels. When it takes a\r\nchronic form, the hogs become stunted.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Endeavor to find out the cause and remove it. If constipated,\r\ngive Calomel, fifteen to twenty grains, or, if diarrhoea appears, give\r\nhog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. Feed\r\nwith hot wheat bran mashes. This will expel all worms and aid digestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE.\r\n\r\n(_Yellows_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Liver flukes, intestinal worms, gall stones, lack of exercise,\r\noverfeeding, or a stoppage of the bile duct.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The white portions of the eyes take on a yellow color, as do\r\nthe membranes of the mouth, back arched, hair looks rough, vomiting,\r\ntemperature elevated, constipation, although diarrhoea is sometimes\r\nnoticed. The urine is passed frequently, and is of a dark amber color.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—This disease requires careful feeding and plenty of exercise.\r\nGive Calomel, ten to twenty grains, then follow with large doses of\r\nregulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It is\r\nimportant in this disease, especially if due to worms. Feed clean swill\r\nand vegetables. Give hogs all the pure water they will drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNEY CONGESTION.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Hogs are subject to various injuries about the kidneys, due to a\r\nlarge number of hogs piling up, exposure to cold, wet rains, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Small quantities of dark colored urine are passed frequently,\r\nappetite poor, no energy to move about. Hogs lie around a great deal; at\r\ntimes they may be paralyzed and drag their hind quarters.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Apply cloths or blankets wrung out of hot water over the\r\nloin; also give Potassium Acetate in twenty grain doses four or five\r\ntimes a day in drinking water. Feed soft, sloppy food, containing\r\nregulator and tonic as prescribed on the first page of this chapter. It\r\ncontains nerve stimulants, just what is required in paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDNEY WORM.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Damp, filthy surroundings seem to favor the growth of embryos of\r\nthis worm. They are taken into the digestive canal with the food and\r\neventually pass to the region of the kidneys, where they find conditions\r\nfavorable in which to multiply.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—May produce paralysis of the hind quarters, in which case the\r\nanimal would not exhibit such marked tenderness on being pressed over the\r\nloins with the fingers as it would if the weakness of the hind quarters\r\nwas due to a sprain or to rheumatism of the loins. Occasionally hogs may\r\nsuffer from the presence of one or more worms in the kidneys; but the\r\nailment is rarely fatal, becoming so only after a long time of suffering\r\nresulting in a degeneration of one or both kidneys. It is almost\r\nimpossible to diagnose the presence of worms in the kidneys of hogs,\r\nexcept by chance through a microscopic examination of the urine. If worms\r\nare found in the kidneys of a hog that has died or has been slaughtered\r\nfor food it may then be reasonably supposed that other hogs of the same\r\nherd not acting normal are infected with worms of the same species.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Teaspoonful doses of Turpentine in milk three times a week is\r\nthe only treatment I could recommend. Preventive measures is the only\r\npractical method of treating a disease of this nature. Give your hogs\r\npure water and food. Disinfect pens occasionally and keep them clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE ON HOGS.\r\n\r\nDip, spray or scrub your hogs with some good Coal Tar disinfectant, but\r\nwhatever remedy is used it should be applied more than once which, of\r\ncourse, causes considerable work where there is a large number of hogs\r\ninfested, unless dipped, which is more quickly done. The reason for\r\nrepeated applications being necessary is that although the lice which\r\nhogs pick up from the ground, bedding and rubbing places, may be killed\r\nby first application, it often does not affect the nits, which remain\r\nintact and hatch within a week or ten days. A new crop of Lice appears\r\non the hog from this source. Remove all manure and bedding from pens\r\nand sheds and burn it. Disinfect floors and spray sides of shed, pens\r\nand rubbing places with disinfectants, one part to seventy-two parts of\r\nwater, once a month and you will be handsomely repaid for your labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG FEVER.\r\n\r\n(_Inflammation of the Lungs_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Sudden changes, exposure to storms, piling up of hogs during cold\r\nnights, or sleeping in manure heaps, old straw stacks, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Pig or hog is taken with shivering spells, is stupid, his back\r\nis arched, loss of appetite, temperature elevated two to four degrees\r\nabove normal, short hurried breathing, generally accompanied with cough,\r\nwhich is deep and hoarse. As a rule the hog is constipated.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Place in good, clean, warm, well ventilated quarters, free\r\nfrom drafts. Keep water before them at all times, adding Saltpeter,\r\none teaspoonful to every gallon of water. If constipated, do not give\r\nphysics; give injections of soap and warm water; also administer about\r\none-half teaspoonful of Pine Tar on the tongue with a wooden paddle.\r\nThis adheres to the tongue and gradually dissolves and gives excellent\r\nresults, as it is very soothing to the organs of breathing. During the\r\nconvalescent stage, give hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first\r\npage of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG WORMS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—By thread-like worms varying in length from one-half to one and\r\none-half inches and of brownish-white color. They are found in the\r\nwindpipe and tubes leading into the lungs. The adult worms in the lungs\r\nproduce large quantities of eggs, which are coughed up with mucus and\r\nbecome scattered over premises where other hogs are permitted to walk.\r\nThe hogs inhale the dust containing the eggs into their lungs, where the\r\neggs find moisture sufficient for their development.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Severe coughing spells. Large quantities of mucus will escape\r\nfrom the nose and mouth. The hog becomes stunted, although he may eat\r\nfairly well, but if not relieved, the worms collect in the Bronchi\r\nand produce sudden death due to suffocation. The worms may set up an\r\ninflammation of the lining membranes of the lungs, which is sometimes\r\ntaken for Swine Plague, or Cholera. This disease is not uncommon,\r\nespecially in old, filthy, poorly drained hog houses and pastures.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Confine the affected hogs to a shed; close the windows and\r\ndoors and any large cracks, then compel the hogs to inhale steam from\r\nthe following mixture: Turpentine, eight ounces; Pine Tar, one pint;\r\nWater, two gallons. Place in tin receptacle in center of the shed and\r\nheat the above solution by adding hot bricks or stones to the mixture\r\noccasionally. Compel them to inhale this steam for at least thirty\r\nminutes twice a day. Feed wholesome food to which add hog tonic as\r\nprescribed on first page of this chapter. A strong, vigorous hog may have\r\nworms, but it retains its vitality so long as it is well fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—By the Sarcoptes Scabei. This parasite burrows under the outer\r\nsurface of the skin.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The parasite usually manifests itself on the skin under the\r\narmpits, thighs and inside of the fore legs. At first small red blotches\r\nor pimples appear, and these gradually spread as the parasites multiply\r\nand burrow under the skin.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—There is no other way of curing this disease, or of preventing\r\nit, than by killing the parasites and their eggs; not only on the pigs\r\nthemselves, but also on the sides of the pens, sheds, rubbing-posts, or\r\nanything that an affected hog rubs against.\r\n\r\nWhen treating this disease, the real aim must be to kill the parasite by\r\nthe prompt and continuous use of external remedies, such as washing or\r\ndipping, which is better done with some good disinfectant, one part to\r\nseventy parts water. Repeat this every ten days until cured. Two dippings\r\nare generally sufficient. It is well to feed cooling foods, such as clean\r\nslops and vegetables, containing regulator and tonic as prescribed on\r\nfirst page of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVEL RUPTURE.\r\n\r\n(_Navel or Umbilical_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Injuries. Pigs crowding through narrow doorways or openings in\r\nfences, small pigs sleeping with large pigs, and allowed to pile up, or\r\nbeing thrown about feed troughs when feeding. Weakness and constipation\r\nalso predisposes them to Navel or Umbilical Rupture.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—A soft, puffy swelling about the navel or umbilicus, varying\r\nin size from a hazelnut to that of an ostrich egg. When a pig is placed\r\non its back the intestines will gravitate into the abdominal cavity,\r\nproviding the intestines have not adhered to the walls of the rupture.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—This is more difficult than the Scrotal or Inguinal Rupture\r\noperation, as often times the intestines will adhere to the inner surface\r\nof the rupture and, unless the operation is carefully performed, there\r\nis great danger. Great care must be exercised in preparing the pig by\r\nfasting it for twenty-four hours. After this is accomplished, prepare\r\nan antiseptic solution, Carbolic Acid, five per cent, or Bichloride of\r\nMercury, one in one-thousandths; also have a needle and absorbent silk or\r\ncat-gut ready. Place the pig on its back, with its head downward. Now,\r\nwash the seat of operation with either antiseptic solution. Then make\r\nan incision through the skin carefully; as stated before, intestines\r\nsometimes adhere to the inner surface of the rupture. If such is the\r\ncase, wash the hands in the antiseptic solution and with the fingers\r\ncarefully break the adhesions or separate the intestines from their\r\nadhesions. After this is accomplished, sew the inner lining of the\r\nabdominal cavity with absorbent silk or cat-gut. Then sew the outer skin\r\nwith cotton or linen cord and your operation is complete. Feed the hog\r\nsparingly for a few days following the operation on easily digested,\r\nlaxative foods.\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTLE RASH.\r\n\r\n(_Urticaira_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritations of the skin produced by sprinkling hogs with\r\nirritating solutions and powders, or from irritating dips when treating\r\nfor lice, etc. Feeding highly nitrogenous food predisposes hogs to this\r\ndisease; also filth, poorly drained sheds and pens; is especially common\r\nin young pigs. Nettle Rash is not contagious, but what produces it in one\r\nhog may produce it in several at the same time.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Red, swollen blotches appear on the skin very suddenly,\r\nespecially about the ears and the inside of the thighs, perhaps due to\r\nthe skin being thin and deprived of hair. The hog rubs account of the\r\nintense itching, and he will not thrive when in this condition. In most\r\ncases there is a fluid oozing from the blotches, causing dirt and filth\r\nto adhere to the hair. However, if the disease is properly treated, a\r\nrecovery is sure to follow in about two weeks.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Prevention against this disease is most important, and it\r\nconsists in keeping shoats and pigs in clean, well ventilated sheds and\r\npens. Do not sprinkle them with irritating solutions or powders, or\r\nirritating dips, but when the disease once shows itself give each pig or\r\nhog affected a dose of Epsom Salts, one ounce to every twenty-five pounds\r\nof hog weight, in feed, swill or drinking water. If the weather is hot,\r\nkeep them in a clean, cool place, also purify their blood by feeding\r\nregulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter.\r\n\r\nApply some good Coal Tar disinfectant, one part to one hundred parts of\r\nwater. This is non-irritating, and will destroy hog lice, and will heal\r\nthe pustules of nettle rash. Apply twice ten days apart. It also must be\r\nborne in mind that pens and sleeping quarters must be disinfected; the\r\nold bedding and manure burned and replaced with good, clean straw or hay.\r\nFeed easily digested food, slops, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE HIND QUARTERS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—There are a great many things that may produce paralysis of the\r\nhind quarters. For instance, shipping hogs in crates; fractions of thigh\r\nbones; Rickets, due to feeding food that is deficient in mineral matter;\r\nhogs piling up; kicks or injuries to the back; frequently seen in sows\r\nnursing a litter of pigs and in a run-down condition. Constipation and\r\nindigestion also produce paralysis of the hind quarters. Some think it is\r\ncaused by worms in the kidneys; this is not always the case. It is true\r\nthat the presence of a parasite around the kidneys may cause irritation\r\nof the nerves of the spinal column and result in paralysis. Yet, it is\r\nmore often the result of weakness and loss of nervous power of the hind\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Regardless of the cause, the symptoms in either case, for they\r\ncannot be distinguished, are weakness of the back, wriggling of the\r\nhind parts, and finally the hogs sit down on their haunches. After some\r\neffort, they get up and run in a straight line quite fast, but swing to\r\none side for a while and then go over to the other side, and finally get\r\ndown so that they cannot rise, but drag themselves about. The appetite is\r\ngood until a day or two before they die.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Place the hog in clean, comfortable quarters, with plenty of\r\nfresh water to drink. Give sour milk, fruit or vegetables, containing\r\nregulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It\r\ncontains nerve stimulants and blood purifiers. If the hog is constipated,\r\nadd two to four ounces of Epsom Salts to its feed.\r\n\r\nTreatment of all such cases requires perseverance, recovery being slow\r\nand not always certain.\r\n\r\n\r\nPILES.\r\n\r\n(_Prolapse of the Anus_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Although the pig may look well, he has a weakness of the circular\r\nfibres of the intestines, due to irritating foods that either constipate\r\nor produce diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Very plain. A protrusion of the rectum all the way from two to\r\nfour inches. The pig irritates the protrusion by rubbing it against the\r\nsides of pens, etc.; it cracks, bleeds and in warm weather will become\r\nfly-blown and maggots accumulate in large quantities.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—In the first stages of this disease, wash the protruded parts\r\nwith an antiseptic solution of Carbolic Acid, one teaspoonful to a pint\r\nof water. Give rectal injections of Soap and Warm Water or Sweet Oil,\r\ngive about two ounces of Castor Oil internally and feed soft, sloppy\r\nfood. In chronic cases of long standing, remove the exposed portion of\r\nthe intestine after washing nicely with the antiseptic solution. Remove\r\nthe protrusion with a sharp knife and stitch the cut end of intestine\r\nedges to the anus. Feed easily digested food, such as wheat bran, mixed\r\nwith flaxseed meal on which boiling hot water has been poured, cooling\r\nbefore feeding. Also give regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page\r\nof this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIN WORMS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Hogs consume the eggs that encapsule well matured embryonic worms\r\nwith their food or drinking water. These worms multiply very rapidly in\r\nthe small intestines and are from one-half to one inch in length.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—No signs are noticed unless the worms are very abundant, as\r\nthey are small and difficult to see with the naked eye. The principal\r\npoint of attack is in the back part of the small intestines, where\r\nconsiderable inflammation is set up, especially when there are other\r\nworms, such as the Roundworm, present.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Is of little value, as the worms in the intestines are\r\nvery difficult to get at, but as their presence causes very little\r\ndisturbance, it is hardly worth while treating; however, preventive\r\nmeasures should be applied by disinfecting, burning manure and bedding.\r\n\r\nThe following has proven a very effective treatment for Pinworms:\r\nPowdered Quassia, one pound; Sulphur, two pounds; Glauber Salts, one\r\npound; Powdered Tobacco, one-half pound; Sulphide of Antimony, one\r\npound; Hyposulphite of Soda, two pounds; Beechwood Charcoal, one pound;\r\nCommon Salt, two pounds.\r\n\r\nThe above must be well powdered and thoroughly mixed. Give one heaping\r\nteaspoonful to every one hundred pounds of hog weight. To small pigs,\r\ngive doses in proportion to weight. Place it in their feed or slop twice\r\na day. In addition to being a vermifuge, it is an alterative and tonic\r\nthat should be given pigs and hogs which do not thrive properly. Best\r\nresults are obtained in treatment of Pinworm when the principal food\r\nconsists of vegetables, mashes and slops.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Exposure to cold, damp, chilly weather, especially to drafts, or\r\nby a large number of hogs being allowed to pile up during cold nights,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Chilling, temperature elevated two or three degrees above\r\nnormal; breathing fast. The hog will show great pain when pressed over\r\nthe lungs by flinching, squealing or grunting; couching suppressed, ribs\r\nrigid; breathing mostly with the muscles of the flanks; appetite poor and\r\neventually there will be fluids accumulate in the lung cavities. At this\r\nstage, the breathing is labored and difficult. If the ear is pressed over\r\nthe lungs, the fluids can be heard, and in the first stage the sound will\r\nbe similar to that of rubbing hair between the finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the cause. The treatment is satisfactory if applied\r\nin due time. Place in clean, comfortable shed, seeing that it is well\r\nventilated, omit drafts; apply equal parts of Aqua Ammonia Fort.,\r\nTurpentine and Sweet Oil over the lungs and give two or four ounces of\r\nCastor Oil in milk. Feed easily digested food, such as hot wheat bran\r\nmashes, containing hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page of\r\nthis chapter. It is also well to feed vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Exposure, as in cold, damp houses. Overfeeding also has a tendency\r\nto cause swellings of the joints and muscles.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Lameness of one or more limbs, swelling of the joints about the\r\nlegs and feet. The hog does not care to move, refusing its feed in most\r\ncases: temperature slightly elevated; breathing quick and short; he will\r\ndrink water frequently if offered.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—I am of opinion that Rheumatism in hogs would be a very rare\r\ndisease if they were properly provided with clean, dry quarters, with a\r\nliberal quantity of bedding. Do not allow hogs to pile up, as it is very\r\ninjurious to them.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—Consists of feeding sloppy food to which add one-half\r\ndram of Sodium Salicylate two or three times a day in their feed.\r\nVegetables and green grass are very beneficial in this disease, as\r\nthey have a cooling effect on the blood. The hog tonic and regulator\r\nrecommended on first page of this chapter is very beneficial when given\r\nwith food of a sloppy nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICKETS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Food deficient in mineral matter or lime; filth, lack of exercise,\r\nand crowded quarters, all tend to produce a softening of the bones and\r\nswelling of the joints.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The pigs affected generally appear in good condition and\r\nseem to be doing well, but suddenly they become paralyzed in the hind\r\nquarters, owing to the weakened condition of the bones, which sometimes\r\nfracture without receiving injury or any additional weight to that of the\r\npig itself. The bones of the snout, back, limbs and feet bend and become\r\ndeformed. The pigs grow weak, poor and stunted and perhaps the best\r\ntreatment is to destroy them.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE TREATMENT.—Careful feeding of good, wholesome food. This\r\ndisease is very seldom seen where hogs are frequently fed corn.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—When the first signs of Rickets appear, feed regulator\r\nand tonic as prescribed on first page of this chapter. It contains the\r\nmineral matter needed by the hog.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND WORMS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Is undoubtedly due to filth or hogs eating food or drinking water\r\ncontaminated with well developed eggs or embryos of roundworms, thus\r\ntaking them into their digestive canal, where they multiply rapidly and\r\nset up considerable irritation. This worm varies in length from three to\r\nthirteen inches, and is of a reddish-brown color.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The Roundworm is generally passed with the feces, and can be\r\nreadily seen with the naked eye. A hog infested with a large number of\r\nthese worms is generally restless, appetite varied. When these worms\r\ndevelop in large numbers, they obstruct the intestines. In other cases\r\nthey irritate and inflame the intestines, causing inflammation and\r\ndiarrhoea, and death may be due to either obstruction or inflammation of\r\nthe bowels.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Treatment is very satisfactory. Withhold all food from\r\neighteen to twenty-four hours. Then place in one pint of finely ground\r\nfeed, Calomel and Santonin, each five grains to every one hundred pounds\r\nof hog weight. For instance, if the hog affected with round worms weighs\r\ntwo hundred pounds, double the dose by giving ten grains of each of the\r\nabove, but if the hog only weighs fifty pounds, give one-half the dose\r\nmentioned, or two and one-half grains of each. This treatment should\r\nbe repeated in a week or ten days to assure the expulsion of worms that\r\nmight have survived the first dose. Feed sparingly on laxative food, as\r\nbran mashes and vegetables, for a few days following each treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE.\r\n\r\n(_Scrotal or Inguinal_)\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.—In the male the intestines pass through the wide Inguinal\r\nCanal, through which the cord of the testicle passes. It is not difficult\r\nto recognize this form of rupture, as the scrotum that normally retains\r\nonly the testicles is usually enlarged by the bowels entering it.\r\nSometimes the scrotum almost reaches the ground, and in this case,\r\nboth sides of the scrotum, or the sack which contains the testicles,\r\nalso contains intestines. If the pig is held up by the hind parts, the\r\nintestines will gravitate back into the abdominal cavity, but as soon\r\nas a pig lies down or stands they again return into the scrotum. The\r\ntesticles can be located at the bottom of the enlargement.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Hereditary tendencies predisposes them to rupture; pigs having\r\nlarge Inguinal Canals through which the testicle passes; by pigs being\r\ncrowded, injured, squeezed at troughs, or passing through narrow\r\ndoorways. Weakness and severe straining from constipation also produce\r\nrupture.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—An enlargement of the sack containing the testicles. Sometimes\r\nthere may be a strangulation of the intestines where they fold or twist.\r\nThey become inflamed and produce death. The pig dies in great pain, but\r\nfortunately, strangulated ruptures in pigs are very rare, as the scrotum\r\nand canal which the intestines occupy relax and become very roomy.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Operation is the only method of relieving or curing Inguinal\r\nor Scrotal Rupture. My advice is to operate as soon as possible. When\r\nthe pigs are small, there is less danger. The pig to be operated on\r\nshould be fasted for at least twenty-four hours, as it is easier on both\r\nthe operator and the pig when the intestines are empty, or nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe operation which I have found to be very successful is as follows:\r\nHave an assistant hold the pig up by its hind legs. Prepare an antiseptic\r\nsolution of Carbolic Acid five per cent, or Bichloride of Mercury, one\r\nin one-thousandths, in a pan. Have a needle threaded with a medium sized\r\nabsorbent silk or cat-gut suture. Prepare a clean, sharp knife; wash\r\nthe seat of operation with either antiseptic solution. Now, proceed to\r\nlocate the testicle by having the hind parts elevated. The intestines\r\nmust be pressed back into the abdominal cavity. The testicle will remain\r\nin the sack or scrotum; now grasp the testicle between the fingers and\r\nmake the incision through the scrotum and to the lower portion. It may\r\nbe necessary to insert two fingers to withdraw the testicle. When the\r\ntesticle is located, withdraw it. Before cutting it off it is well to run\r\na needle containing a thread through the last covering of the testicle\r\nso as to prevent the membrane from returning. After this is securely\r\ndone, remove the testicle and sew the inner membranes that envelop the\r\nrupture and testicle with what is called a “tobacco pouch suture.” Draw\r\nit together firmly and tie and cut off suture about one-half inch from\r\nthe knot. Your operation is now complete. Do not sew the outer incision\r\nin the scrotum, as it would have a tendency to accumulate dirt and hold\r\npus. It should have a free drainage. Wash with one of the above mentioned\r\nantiseptics twice daily until thoroughly healed. Also feed laxative foods\r\nthat are easily digested.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE FEET.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Filth, especially common in large hogs when confined to hard\r\nfloors or driven over rough, hard roads, or continually kept in filthy\r\npens. The tissues of the feet become softened, especially those between\r\nthe claws. Irritation is set up by germs entering the abrasions.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The hogs will be noticed going very lame and if closely\r\nexamined the above named conditions will be found.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the hogs to clean, dry pens containing plenty of clean\r\nbedding, and wash the affected parts with some good disinfectant, as five\r\nper cent solution of Carbolic Acid. Repeat this treatment at least once a\r\nday. In case the feet are badly inflamed, I would advise the application\r\nof hot Flaxseed Meal poultices to the feet. Feed easily digested food, as\r\nit aids materially in the treatment of infectious wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE MOUTH.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Decomposed foods. Also slops or stagnant water, washing powders,\r\nbroken glassware, etc., from the tables, fed in slops, barley or wheat\r\nbeards, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Difficulty in eating, or refusal to eat at all. Stringy\r\nsecretions of saliva continually oozing from the mouth. The mouth gives\r\noff a very offensive odor.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—In this form of sore mouth, remove the cause. Feed soft,\r\nwholesome food, such as wheat bran mashes and vegetables. In cases where\r\nit is due to the lodging of beards of wheat or barley, gag the hog’s\r\nmouth with a piece of wood and remove the beards with forceps. Keep\r\nclean, cool water before them at all times and avoid feeding dry, hard\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOWS EATING THEIR YOUNG.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Insufficient lime or mineral matter fed prior to farrowing;\r\nconstipation is also a fruitful cause.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.—Careful feeding for a few days prior to farrowing of slops,\r\nfree from soap or washing powders; cool food, such as wheat bran mashes,\r\nwith hog tonic and regulator as prescribed on the first page of this\r\nchapter. This is loosening to the bowels and also contains mineral matter\r\nand blood purifiers which are very valuable in the above mentioned\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUN OR HEAT STROKE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Hogs that are very fat, and driven, hauled or shipped to\r\nmarket when the weather is warm, are frequently stricken with heat or\r\nsun-stroke. Sometimes when hogs are overcrowded and not protected from\r\nthe rays of the sun, or from heat, they may become victims of heat or\r\nsun-stroke.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—First they stagger when walking, then they become very weak\r\nand temperature elevates three or four degrees higher than normal.\r\nProstration or extreme depression, or sometimes involuntary spasms or\r\ncontractions of muscles occur.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Prevention. Do not drive, haul or ship during the hottest\r\npart of the day, hogs that are not accustomed to exercise or extreme\r\nheat. Do not crowd hogs in small pens or sheds during the hot months,\r\nas their bodies give off considerable heat in addition to that of the\r\nsun. See that they are protected from the sun. When hauling or shipping\r\nhogs, wet them occasionally with water. It prevents heat stroke. In case\r\na hog is suffering from heat or sun-stroke, place it in a cool, shady\r\nplace and apply ice or cold water to the head only. Also give Saltpeter\r\nin teaspoonful doses every six hours diluted in one ounce of water. Also\r\ngive Alcohol, one teaspoonful, every three hours in one ounce of water.\r\nGood recovery is often obtained from the above treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORN-HEADED WORMS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—A white grub that is found in old manure heaps, straw stacks and\r\nhog lots carries eggs containing embryos of the Thorn-headed Worm. The\r\nwhite grub is eaten by the hog. The larvae of the Thorn-headed Worm is\r\nliberated by the process of digestion and becomes a parasite in the\r\nintestines of the hogs, where it develops into a fully matured worm.\r\nLarge numbers of hogs quickly become infested with this parasite, as they\r\nmultiply very rapidly. These worms vary from two to twelve inches in\r\nlength, and have a whitish color.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—As a general rule, a worm can be seen in the feces. Other signs\r\nare that the hog loses flesh, appetite irregular, constipation, and then\r\nagain there may be diarrhoea, especially where there are large numbers of\r\nworms present.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—First of all, burn all manure or decomposed vegetation\r\nthat the hogs are liable to come in contact with. Withhold all food\r\nfrom eighteen to twenty-four hours and give one teaspoonful of Oil of\r\nTurpentine to every one hundred pounds of hog weight, or if the hog\r\nweighs less than one hundred pounds, doses should be given in proportion.\r\nFollow this treatment for three or, four consecutive days. Turpentine\r\nis easily given to hogs, as they will drink it in milk when well mixed.\r\nPerhaps it is advisable, where a large number of hogs are affected, to\r\ndivide them into pens of five or ten hogs, as they are thus less likely\r\nto get an overdose. Feed laxative food. Clean and disinfect troughs and\r\nfeeding floors. Also give prescription on first page of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUMPS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Disorders of the digestive system from overloading the stomach and\r\ncausing irritation of the nerves leading to the diaphragm, which is the\r\nmembrane that separates the lungs and heart from the intestines, stomach,\r\nliver and spleen. It is a spasm of this membrane that causes a hog or\r\npig to have “Thumps.” Insufficient exercise; a large number of pigs may\r\nbecome affected at the same time when closely confined.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Jerking of the flanks; the pig or hog becomes very weak and\r\nstunted in a very short time.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the cause. In pigs, when first affected, careful\r\nfeeding and exercise will generally effect a cure. In some cases, where\r\nthe pigs are very small, it is well to take them away from the mother,\r\npermitting them to nurse very little. Give them Castor Oil in teaspoonful\r\ndoses, and compel them to exercise. It may be necessary to give them\r\nChloral Hydrate ten to fifteen grains two or three times a day diluted in\r\na teaspoonful of water. Where the pigs will not eat mashes or drink milk,\r\ngive them medicine by force with a teaspoon.\r\n\r\nAFTER TREATMENT.—Give hog regulator and tonic as prescribed on first page\r\nof this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHIP WORM.\r\n\r\nThis worm is very uncommon, but occasionally is found in the large\r\nintestines.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—The eggs become imbedded in the manure, bedding, etc., and then\r\nmix with the food and drinking water and are taken into the digestive\r\ncanal where they develop into matured worms. This worm is from one to\r\nthree inches in length, the hind extremity of which is very thin, hence\r\nthe name, “Whipworm.”\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—They produce very little disturbance, even though present in\r\nlarge quantities, except when other worms assist in their irritating the\r\nlining membranes of the large intestines.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours,\r\nthen give one teaspoonful of Gasoline thoroughly mixed with milk, to\r\nevery one hundred pounds of hog weight. Small hogs, reduce the dose in\r\nproportion to their weight. It is advisable to follow this dose for two\r\nor three consecutive days. Feed food that is easily digested, and see\r\nthat they have fresh water to drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DISEASES OF\r\n                             Sheep and Goats\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           CAUSE, SYMPTOMS AND\r\n                                TREATMENT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCATION OF PARTS OF SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nLOCATION OF PARTS OF SHEEP\r\n\r\n    1.

KORINEK, V. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Is usually produced by injuries, or by the ewes being poisoned\r\nfrom eating poisonous foods, plants, etc. It has never occurred in\r\ninfectious form in this country, although sometimes an outbreak is\r\nthought infectious on account of several ewes aborting about the same\r\ntime, but all such outbreaks have been traced to some irritating poison\r\nwhich they had taken with their food or drinking water.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE TREATMENT.—Remove the aborted lambs or kids and afterbirth\r\nfrom the yards, and also withdraw the ewe or nanny and place her in\r\ncomfortable quarters. She requires care and extra nursing, or she will\r\nbecome very poor and lose a large portion of her fleece.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—If due to poisonous plants, etc., when the first\r\nsymptoms of Abortion or poisoning are noticed, give six to ten ounces of\r\nCastor Oil. Warm the oil so it will run freely. Set the sheep or goat\r\nupon its haunches and pour very slowly. Great care must be exercised so\r\nas not to let any of the oil enter the lungs, as it may produce fatal\r\npneumonia. Feed food that is easily digested and supply them with pure\r\nwater to drink. When the general condition is weak or run down, so to\r\nspeak, the following tonic is recommended: Pulv. Gentian Root, one\r\nounce; Pulv. Nux Vomica, one ounce; Pulv. Potassium Nitrate, one ounce;\r\nHyposulphite of Soda, three ounces; Protan, three ounces. Mix and make\r\ninto twenty-four powders. Give one powder two or three times daily well\r\nback on the tongue.\r\n\r\nREMEMBER all tonics are bitter, therefore beware of any so-called tonics\r\nthat the animals eat readily, as these possess no real tonic values.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK SCOURS.\r\n\r\n(_Verminous Gastritis—Strongylosis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to a worm (Strongylus Contortus) measuring one-fourth to one\r\ninch in length, inhabiting the intestines and the fourth stomach of sheep\r\nand goats. This disease is frequently seen in low, marshy pastures, where\r\nanimals infested with the worm pass the ova or egg with the feces, the\r\neggs developing into an embryotic worm which is again taken with the food\r\nor water by non-infected animals, whereby this disease again attacks the\r\nintestines and fully matured worms develop.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Naturally, the symptoms vary according to the violence of\r\nthe attack. In well developed cases, the animal strains to defecate,\r\nand passes shreds of intestinal mucous along with blood-stained\r\nfeces. Finally a severe dysentery takes place, the animal becomes\r\ncorrespondingly weak, and death takes place in two or three days. Some\r\ncases become chronic, in which death does not take place for a month or\r\nmore. However, the latter is uncommon. Other signs are staggering gait,\r\ntrembling, eyes fixed, showing wild expression, neck turned to one side.\r\nThen the animal appears as if in pain, and looks around at the flank\r\nfrequently. There is a chopping of the jaws, and a very free flow of\r\nstringy saliva from the mouth. When an animal dies from the symptoms\r\njust described, it should be cut open and carefully examined for this\r\nparticular parasite, which can be easily seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Very successfully treated when the first symptoms appear by\r\nadministering one ounce of Gasoline with a pint of Milk. To lambs or kids\r\ngive half the dose. Every precaution should be taken so as to prevent\r\nthe drench from entering the lungs. Perhaps the best method is to set\r\nthe animals on its haunches and pour the liquid slowly and carefully; if\r\nthey cough, let them down. Any drench entering the lungs produces fatal\r\npneumonia. Feed good nourishing food, and supply them with fresh water to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH.\r\n\r\n(_Cold in the Head_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Atmospheric changes, sudden exposure to cold, wet weather after\r\nbeing accustomed to warm, comfortable surroundings, inhaling dust, smoke\r\nand gases or, in fact, anything that will produce an irritation to the\r\nmembranes lining the nose; commonly seen in the spring and fall.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Chilling, elevation of temperature, nose dry, breathing\r\nhurried, sneezing, coughing, dullness, appetite varied. In the first\r\nstages of the malady, the nostrils are considerably inflamed, but in\r\nthe course of a few days the temperature subsides and a yellowish-white\r\ndischarge flows from the nose continuously.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Keep the affected animals dry, omit drafts, feed good,\r\nwholesome food, and provide bedding for them to lie upon. In the first\r\nstages of this malady, it is advisable to confine the animals in a barn,\r\nclosing the windows and doors and compelling them to inhale steam from\r\nboiling hot water and Pine Tar. The best method to accomplish this is\r\nby placing a tub about half full of water in the center of the barn and\r\nadd about one gallon of Pine Tar. Then heat bricks or stones and place\r\nthem into the tub. In this way a large number can be treated at one\r\ntime. The sheep should be compelled to inhale this steam for thirty to\r\nforty minutes twice a day. In addition to the above, the following is\r\nvery beneficial: Chlorate of Potash, one ounce; Nitrate of Potassi, two\r\nounces. Make into sixteen powders and give one powder to each sheep in\r\nits drinking water two or three times daily. Feed hot bran mashes and\r\nvegetables if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.\r\n\r\n(_Dysentery_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Diarrhoea, or Dysentery, is a sign of some irritation of the\r\nintestines resulting in increased secretions, or increased muscular\r\ncontraction, or both. The irritation is sometimes the result of chilling\r\nfrom exposure, improper feeding, as contaminated or frozen foods,\r\nirritating foods, drinking cold or stagnant water, indigestion, organic\r\ndiseases of the intestines, or parasitic diseases. (See Strongylosis.)\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Movements from the bowels are frequent, as first consisting of\r\nthin fecal matter, but as this malady progresses it becomes watery and\r\noffensive in smell, and streaked with blood. At first the animal shows\r\nno constitutional disturbances, but eventually it becomes weak and shows\r\nsigns of abdominal pain by looking around to the flank, throwing the feet\r\ntogether, lying down, or moving restlessly. Sometimes this disease is\r\naccompanied by fever, great depression, loss of strength, rapid loss of\r\nflesh; terminating in death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Determine the cause and remove it if possible. When the\r\ndisease is due to irritating properties of food which have been fed the\r\nanimal, it is well to give a physic of Castor Oil in two to six ounce\r\ndoses, according to the size of the animal. When there is debility, want\r\nof appetite, and temperature normal, but continuous water discharge\r\nfrom the bowels, give Protan, two ounces; Gum Cathechu, one ounce;\r\nPulv. Ginger, one ounce; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, eight grains. Make into\r\nsixteen powders and give one powder on the tongue every three or four\r\nhours, according to the severity of the attack. Feed food that is easily\r\ndigested, as wheat bran mashes, steamed rolled oats, etc. See that the\r\ndrinking water is fresh and clean.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOT ROT.\r\n\r\n(_Foul in the Foot_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Foot Rot is produced by inflammation of the soft structures of\r\nthe foot between the claws or toes. It may be due to an overgrowth and\r\ninward pressure, etc., or from filth accumulating and hardening between\r\nthe claws, producing inflammation and softening or ulceration of the skin\r\nin the interdigital space (between the claws). Under some conditions\r\nseveral sheep or goats in the same drove become affected at the same\r\ntime, leading many to think that the disease is contagious. When Foot Rot\r\nappears in a very short time, among sheep or goats, this condition can\r\nalmost always be traced to filth, irritation, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The animal is observed to limp when walking. On careful\r\nexamination of the foot we find it hot, swollen above the claws and in\r\nthe soft parts between them, frequently spreading the claws apart to a\r\nconsiderable extent, or the inflammation may have advanced to softening\r\nand sloughing of the soft structure between the claws. If this condition\r\nis neglected at this stage, deep abscesses form and the pus burrows\r\nunder the horny wall, and the joints within the hoof become inflamed and\r\ndestroyed, in which case the treatment is difficult and recovery will be\r\nvery arduous.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—In the early stages of the disease, before the pus burrows\r\nbeneath the horny structures of the foot, any foreign substances impacted\r\nbetween the claws should be removed. Then place a trough about one foot\r\nwide, six to eight inches high, and twelve to sixteen feet long, and fill\r\nwith water and Coal Tar Dip, diluted in proportions of one part dip to\r\nfifty parts of water. Build a fence on each side of the trough, just wide\r\nenough for one sheep to pass through, and compel every sheep to walk in\r\nthe solution slowly.\r\n\r\nThis treatment should be repeated once or twice a week until the lameness\r\nhas disappeared. In cases where deep sloughing has taken place under the\r\nhorny structures, saturate a piece of oakum or cotton in the following\r\nliniment: Oil of Origanum, Oil of Pisis, Oil of Turpentine, each four\r\nounces. Place it between the claws and hold it there by means of a\r\nbandage. Repeat this application every other day. The animals that do not\r\nshow signs of improvement under this treatment in a few days invariably\r\nhave the joints of the foot affected and should not be driven.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORAGE POISONING.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—This condition is produced by animals eating various foliage\r\n(Grass or Shrubbery) at a time when the peculiar poisonous principles are\r\ndeveloped in it, as appears to happen in certain seasons. The disease is\r\nliable to affect a large proportion of animals which are under the same\r\ngrazing conditions.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Generally takes two or three days to develop. The animal\r\ngradually becomes more or less unconscious and paralyzed, staggers when\r\nforced to walk, and it may have great difficulty in keeping on its feet,\r\nit is extremely averse to going down, and leans for support against any\r\nconvenient object. It breathes in a snorting manner. The mucous membranes\r\nare tinged with yellow, and the bowels constipated. In other cases\r\nsevere diarrhoea follows, and the animal becomes very weak and dies in\r\nconvulsions or spasms. Recovery may be expected in cases that are not\r\nmarked by severe symptoms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Endeavor to find out the true cause and remove it if possible.\r\nChange range or pasture for a short time; this has successfully\r\neradicated this malady. The animal showing the above symptoms should\r\nreceive four to eight ounces of Castor Oil regardless of whether there\r\nis diarrhoea or constipation. In either case the irritation will be\r\nrelieved by its laxative effect. In cases where diarrhoea becomes\r\nchronic, after administering the Castor Oil, the following will be found\r\nvery efficient in its control: Protan, three ounces; Ginger, one ounce;\r\nGum Catechu, two ounces. Make into sixteen powders and place one powder\r\nwell back on the tongue every four or six hours. Feed clean, wholesome\r\nfood and supply clean, fresh water to drink. Provide shelter for the\r\nanimal if the weather is hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARGET.\r\n\r\n(_Congestion and Inflammation of the Udder_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—As a rule, in Garget or Congestion of the Udder in heavy milking\r\newes, just before and after lambing, the glands of the udder enlarge,\r\nbecome hot, tense and tender and a slight pasty swelling extends forward\r\nfrom the glands on the lower surface of the abdomen. This physiological\r\ncondition is looked upon as a matter of course and disposed of in two\r\nor three days when the secretions of milk have been fully established.\r\nGeneral breaking up of the udder may be greatly hastened by the sucking\r\nof a hungry lamb and the kneading it gives the udder with its nose is\r\nbeneficial. The above mentioned congestion or Garget may emerge into\r\nactive inflammation resulting from continued exposure to cold weather,\r\nstanding in cold drafts or injury to the udder from stone, clubs, feet\r\nof other animals, overfeeding or rich food, like cotton seed or soy\r\nbean, sore teats or a ewe losing her lamb in the period of full milking;\r\nserious disturbances of the animal’s health is liable to fall upon the\r\nudder.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The symptoms and mode of attack vary in different cases.\r\nFollowing exposure to cold drafts or cold, wet weather, there is usually\r\nsevere chilling with cold ears and limbs and general dryness and\r\nbrittleness of the wool. This is followed by a flush of heat, the ears\r\nand limbs become unnaturally warm and the glands swell up and become\r\nfirm and solid in one or both sides of the udder. The muzzle is hot\r\nand dry, temperature elevated two or three degrees above normal, pulse\r\nfirm and quick, excited breathing, appetite and rumination suspended,\r\nbowels constipated, urine scanty and the yield of milk may be entirely\r\nsuppressed in the affected side.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Determine the cause and remove it if possible. Move the\r\naffected animals to comfortable quarters, supply liberal quantities of\r\nbedding for the animal to lie upon. Give two to six ounces of Glauber\r\nSalts dissolved in a pint of hot water. Permit it to cool. Place the ewe\r\non her haunches and drench carefully. Feed laxative foods as hot bran\r\nmashes, steamed rolled oats and vegetables, supplying the animal with\r\npure water to drink, to which add two drams of Hyposulphite of Soda, two\r\nor three times a day. In some cases it is advisable to apply Camphorated\r\nOintment to the udder once or twice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nGID.\r\n\r\n(_Sturdy_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Gid is produced by a bladder worm, a larva or an egg of the\r\ntapeworm infesting the intestines of dogs, wolves and coyotes. The eggs\r\nof these tapeworms are scattered over the range or pastures in the\r\ndroppings of infested dogs, wolves or coyotes, and these when swallowed\r\nin the food or water by the sheep, hatch out and the embryos migrate to\r\nthe brain, spinal cord, etc., where they develop into cysts, bladder\r\nworms or water bags, etc. When the organs of sheep, thus infested, are\r\neaten by dogs, wolves or coyotes, the cyst worms are also likely to be\r\nswallowed and then develop into mature tapeworms.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—In case a large number of embryos become lodged in the brain\r\nof sheep, the first signs will be shown in about eight to twelve days.\r\nBladder worms produce a congestion of the brain which causes dullness,\r\ndizziness, indicating an affection of the brain, walking or turning in\r\ncircles. If the left side of the brain is affected, they will turn to the\r\nleft; if the right side is affected, they will turn to the right. The\r\nhead eventually droops, the eyes become red and the vision is impaired,\r\nthe head very hot over the affected region, the affected sheep become\r\nseparated from the flock. Sometimes the sheep are partially or completely\r\nparalyzed.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.—Prevention is the only method by which this disease can\r\nbe eradicated. Prevent the sheep from becoming infected with these\r\nparasites. Stray dogs, wolves or coyotes should be killed whenever found,\r\nand dogs too valuable to kill should be kept free from tapeworm. Meat\r\nshould not be fed to dogs unless cooked or known to be free from tapeworm\r\ncysts.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRUBS IN THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n(_Head Maggot_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Grubs in the head of sheep are produced by the Sheep Gadfly which\r\nis yellowish-gray in color with five well divided rings around its body,\r\ncovered over with fine hair and the lower portion of the head white. This\r\nfly is somewhat larger than the ordinary house fly. It attacks sheep and\r\ngoats during the Summer and Fall and deposits its larva about the sheep’s\r\nand goat’s nostrils. This larva attaches itself to the mucous membrane of\r\nthe nostrils with two hooklets by which it gradually works into the air\r\ncavities of the head, remaining there for about ten months. Then it again\r\npasses from the nostrils, burrows into the ground and becomes a fully\r\nmatured Gadfly in six or eight weeks, which completes its life cycle, the\r\nhead of the sheep or goat being its intermediate host where the newly\r\nborn Gadfly again attaches its larva.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—When sheep or goats are attacked by this Gadfly, they run,\r\nstrike at the nose with their front feet, rub the nose on the ground or\r\nagainst other sheep. In case only three or four larvae gain entrance to\r\nthe sinuses of the head, they produce very little, if any, ill effects,\r\nbut where they become numerous, they cause the animal to cough and sneeze\r\ncontinually, discharge from the nose, which is occasionally tinged\r\nwith blood. The appetite becomes impaired, the animal shows signs of\r\nemaciation, becomes very weak, raises the nose in the air, but eventually\r\nbecomes so weak it reels when walking and finally lies down. It becomes\r\nso weak it cannot toss the head or rise, and dies.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION TREATMENT.—Very successful. Paint the sheep’s or goat’s nose\r\nwith Pine Tar, or better still, place salt in a trough, covering it with\r\nboards, with holes bored in them just large enough for the animal to\r\ninsert its nose. Smear Pine Tar about the holes once or twice a week.\r\nThis treatment has proven very efficient in localities where sheep\r\nGadflies are numerous.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—After the animal once becomes infected with these\r\ngrubs, bore holes (trephine) through the skull with a sharp instrument\r\nmade for this purpose and remove the grubs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOVEN.\r\n\r\n(_Bloating—Acute Tympanites—Acute Indigestion_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Hoven is caused by various kinds of food which produce indigestion\r\nor fermentation and resultant gases in the rumen or paunch. When sheep\r\nare first turned into young clover, they eat so greedily of it that\r\nbloating frequently results. Turnips, potatoes and cabbage may also\r\nproduce it. Middlings and corn meal also frequently give rise to it.\r\nIn this connection it may be stated that an excessive quantity of any\r\nfood, before mentioned, may bring on this disorder, or it may not be due\r\nto excessive eating but to eating too fast. Sometimes the quality of\r\nfood is at fault. Grass, clover or alfalfa, when wet with dew or rain\r\nsoaked, frequently produce digestive disorders and bloating follows.\r\nFrozen roots or potatoes covered with white frost should be regarded\r\nas dangerous. When food has been eaten too hastily or when it is cold\r\nand wet, the digestive process is imperfectly performed and the food\r\ncontained in the paunch ferments, during which process large quantities\r\nof gas are formed. This same result may follow when a sheep is choking,\r\nas the obstruction in the gullet prevents the eructation or passing of\r\ngas from the stomach so that the gas continues to accumulate until severe\r\nbloating results.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The swelling of the left flank is very characteristic, as in\r\nwell marked cases the flank at its upper part rises above the level\r\nof the backbone and when struck with the tips of the fingers emits a\r\ndrum-like sound. The animal has an anxious expression, moves uneasily\r\nand is evidently distressed. If relief is not obtained in time the sheep\r\nbreathes with difficulty, reels in walking or standing and in a short\r\ntime falls down and dies from suffocation. The distention of the stomach\r\nor rumen may become so great that it pushes the diaphragm (the membrane\r\nseparating the lung and intestinal cavity) forward against the lungs, so\r\nas to squeeze and stop their movements, thus preventing the animal from\r\nbreathing and in some instances the case may be complicated by a rupture\r\nof the stomach.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Do not waste any time. Puncture about three inches downward\r\nand forward from the point of the hip bone with a clean sharp knife, or\r\nany instrument that is clean and sharp. A special instrument made for\r\nthis purpose, the trocar, is a very useful instrument.\r\n\r\nSometimes bloating becomes chronic, and if such is the case dissolve\r\ntwo teaspoonfuls of Turpentine in one-half pint of milk and drench the\r\nanimal very carefully, as some of this drench may escape into the lungs\r\nand produce fatal pneumonia. Set a sheep upon its haunches to give the\r\nmedicine; if it coughs let it down quickly to prevent strangulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION.\r\n\r\n(_Dyspepsia_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritant food, damaged food, overloaded paunch or sudden change of\r\ndiet may produce this disease. Want of exercise predisposes an animal to\r\nit and it is caused by woody or indigestible food. Food which possesses\r\nastringent (drying) properties tends to check the digestive secretions\r\nand may also act as an exciting cause. Food in excessive quantity may\r\nlead to disorders of the digestion and to this disease. It is very likely\r\nto appear towards the end of the protracted season of drought, therefore\r\na deficiency of water must be regarded as one of the conditions which\r\nfavors its development.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Appetite diminished; rumination, or chewing the cud, irregular;\r\ntongue coated, mouth slimy, feces passed apparently not well digested\r\nand offensive in odor, dullness and fullness of the flanks. This disease\r\nmay, in some cases, assume a chronic character, for in addition to the\r\nabove mentioned symptoms, slight bloating of the left flank may be\r\nobserved. The animal breathes with great difficulty and grunts with each\r\nrespiration. The ears and legs alternately become hot and cold. The\r\nrumination, or cud chewing, at this stage ceases and the usual rumbling\r\nsound in the stomach is not audible. The passage of feces is entirely\r\nsuspended and the animal passes only a little mucus occasionally.\r\nSometimes constipation and diarrhoea alternate; there is a rise in\r\ntemperature in many cases. The disease continues for a few days or a week\r\nin this mild form, while the severe form of the disease may last for\r\nseveral weeks. In the severe form the emaciation and loss of strength\r\nmay be very great. There is no appetite, no rumination or rumbling sound\r\nin the stomach or intestines. The mouth is hot and sticky, the eyes have\r\nretracted in their sockets and the milk secretion has ceased. In such\r\ncases the outlook for recovery is unfavorable. The affected animals fall\r\naway in flesh and become very weak, which is shown by the fact that one\r\nfinds the animal lying down.\r\n\r\nOn examination of sheep or goats which have died of this disease, it is\r\nfound that the lining membranes of the fourth stomach and intestines,\r\nparticularly the small intestines, are red, swollen, streaked with deep\r\nred or blushed lines or spotted. The lining of the third stomach is more\r\nor less softened and may be easily peeled off. The third stomach contains\r\ndry, hard food masses, closely adhering to its walls. In some cases the\r\nbrain appears to become affected, probably from the pain endured and\r\nweakness and absorption of poisons generated in the digestive canal. In\r\nsuch cases there is weakness and a staggering gait; the sheep or goats\r\ndo not appear to see, and will consequently run against obstacles. After\r\na time it falls down and gives up to a violent disordered struggle. This\r\ndelirious condition is succeeded by stupor and death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Successful, if fed in its first stages on small quantities\r\nof roots, sweet silage or select grasses or hay. This should be offered\r\nseveral times daily. Very little food should be allowed if the animal\r\nis constipated, in which case give two to four ounces of Glauber Salts\r\ndissolved in a pint of hot water. When it cools, set the animal on its\r\nhaunches and pour slowly and carefully. If they strangle or cough let\r\nthem down, as some of the drench may escape into the lungs and produce\r\nlung complications. After the Glauber Salts have acted and if there is\r\na lack of appetite and the animal does not chew the cud regularly, the\r\nfollowing tonic will be found beneficial: Pulv. Gentian Root, one ounce;\r\nPulv. Nux Vomica, one ounce; Pulv. Anise Seed, two ounces. Mix thoroughly\r\nand make into thirty-two powders. Give one powder two or three times a\r\nday well back on the tongue. The food must be rather laxative and of\r\na digestible character. After an attack of this form of indigestion,\r\nice cold water should be avoided. Food should be given in moderate\r\nquantities, as any excess by overtaxing the digestive functions may bring\r\non a relapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE.\r\n\r\n(_Liver Congestion—Inflammation of the Liver_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Jaundice or Liver Congestion is due to constipation where there\r\nis an inactive or torpid condition of the bowels and the bile which\r\npasses into the intestines is absorbed and produces a yellow staining of\r\nJaundice. Jaundice is merely a symptom of a disease and ought to direct\r\nattention to ascertain if possible the cause or causes which give rise\r\nto it. Inflammation of the liver usually occurs as a complication of\r\ninfectious diseases. It may also occur as a complication of intestinal\r\ncatarrh, or in hot weather from overheating, eating decomposed or\r\nirritating food or from drinking stagnant water.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The signs are sometimes obscure and their real significance is\r\nfrequently overlooked. The most prominent symptoms are the yellowness\r\nof the white of the eyes and of the mucous membranes lining the mouth,\r\nappetite poor, body presents an emaciated appearance, the feces is light\r\nin color, while the urine is likely to be unusually dark and there is\r\ngreat thirst present. The gait is weak and the animal lies down more\r\nthan usual and while doing so frequently has its head around resting on\r\nthe side of its chest. Temperature is slightly elevated above normal and\r\nbreathing is somewhat hurried.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the cause if possible. Give Glauber Salts in three to\r\nfour ounce doses, diluted in a pint of hot water permitted to cool and\r\ngive at one dose. When drenching, be very careful, as some of the liquid\r\nmay escape into the lungs and produce severe complications. Feed green\r\nfood or hot bran mashes and supply them with a liberal quantity of pure\r\nwater to drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVER FLUKE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—The parasite that produces Liver Fluke in sheep has an oblong,\r\nflat, leaf-like body, brownish in color, measuring from one-fourth to\r\none-half inch in length. Sheep become infected with this Liver Fluke from\r\ngrazing on low marshy pastures infected by the larvae of Liver Fluke.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—A sheep, when first infected with Liver Fluke, generally\r\nthrives as the parasites tend to stimulate the process of digestion,\r\nbeing located as they are in the liver, but eventually rumination\r\nbecomes irregular, the sheep becomes anemic, weak and the visible mucous\r\nmembranes of the mouth, nose and eyes become pale, bloodless, taking on\r\na yellowish color as the disease progresses. Swellings will also appear\r\nunder the jaw along the neck and under the lung cavity. The process of\r\nbreathing becomes feeble and temperature irregular. Pregnant ewes will\r\ngenerally abort and nursing ewes’ milk will become so deprived of its\r\nnourishing properties that the lambs become emaciated, although not\r\nnecessarily affected with the Liver Fluke.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.—Move to non-infected pastures, supply the animals grazing on\r\nlow marshy pastures with a liberal amount of salt, also introduce frogs,\r\ntoads, carp, etc., into the marshy ponds, as they destroy the parasite in\r\nits first stages of development, feeding on their intermediate host, the\r\nsnail.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—This is of little value. After an animal once becomes\r\ninfected with the parasite, it never makes a complete recovery, although\r\nCalomel administered in ten grain doses every two or three weeks appears\r\nto have a very good effect in some cases, if fed freely on nitrogenous\r\nfood and permitted to drink well of pure running water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG FEVER.\r\n\r\n(_Pneumonia—Congestion of the Lungs—Pulmonary Apoplexy_)\r\n\r\nAcute congestion and inflammation of the spongy tissues of the lungs is\r\nfrequently seen in sheep, the same as in other animals.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Sheep that are overdriven are subject to Lung Congestion in acute\r\nor chronic form and sometimes Pulmonary Apoplexy, and especially when in\r\na plethoric condition are predisposed to inflammation of the lungs. The\r\nexciting cause is very much the same as in different diseases of the air\r\npassage and it is not uncommon for the inflammation to extend from these\r\nparts of the lungs. However, there are a number of causes in addition to\r\nthose already mentioned. It frequently results when sheep are accustomed\r\nto warm, comfortable quarters and are changed to cold, drafty pens, or\r\nshipping some distance in open stock cars during cold weather. In fact,\r\nany sudden chilling of the body is a common cause of lung disorders.\r\nGiving fat sheep too much exercise when they are not accustomed to it is\r\na very frequent cause of Congestion and Inflammation of the Lungs. This\r\nmay occur when they are chased by dogs, etc., or when driven to a distant\r\nmarket at too rapid a gait. Exercise during the hot summer months is\r\napt to cause congestion of the lung substance, as well as heat stroke.\r\nDipping sheep during cold weather may chill the body and result in this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—If due to severe exercise, the animal appears greatly exhausted\r\nand the Congestion of the Lungs is marked. Death may occur at this stage\r\nof the disease. Inflammation of the Lungs usually begins with a chill and\r\nis followed by a high fever. The sheep stand most of the time and may eat\r\nnothing, or very little. The breathing is hurried at first, but when the\r\nlungs become badly involved, it is also labored. The character of the\r\npulse beat varies, depending on the extent of the inflammation and the\r\nstage of the disease. In most cases the pulse is full and quick during\r\nthe early stages of the disease. A very weak pulse is present in severe\r\nand fatal cases of Pneumonia. The visible mucous membranes have a red\r\ncolored appearance and there may be a slight discharge from the nostrils.\r\nThe expression of the face is anxious and distressed in severe cases and\r\nrigors and chilling of the body occur. The respiratory sounds are more or\r\nless normal. The cough at first is deep and dry; later it becomes loose\r\nand moist. It may be accompanied by a hemorrhage during this stage of the\r\ndisease. Other respiratory sounds are revealed by placing the ear to the\r\nside of the chest walls and listening to the sound of the lungs. This\r\ncannot be practiced in long wooled sheep with satisfaction, as the chest\r\nwalls are so thick that the lung sounds are deadened, or the noise made\r\nby the animal hides the respiratory murmurs in the very early stages of\r\nInflammation of the Lungs. A crepitating or crackling sound can be heard\r\nin the diseased parts and louder sounds than normal in the healthy areas.\r\nLater when the engorgement of the lung substance occurs and the air\r\ncells become filled with an inflammatory serum, the respiratory sounds\r\nare deadened, but on returning to the normal, a rattling sound occurs.\r\nThese symptoms help greatly in determining the animal’s condition and in\r\nwatching the progress of the disease. The chances for the recovery depend\r\non the extent and the acuteness of the inflammation. Careless handling,\r\nexercising, etc., lessen the chances for a favorable termination in\r\nthe disease, but good care helps more to bring about recovery than the\r\nmedical treatment. The recovery is more unfavorable in fat than in lean\r\nsheep, as the inflammation is usually more severe in the former. The\r\ncourse is from seven to twenty-one days and it may become chronic if the\r\nirritation is kept up. In such cases, unthriftiness is a prominent sign.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The preventive treatment in Pneumonia must not be overlooked.\r\nBriefly, it consists in avoiding such conditions as may predispose the\r\nanimal to the disease or act in any way as an exciting cause. Careful\r\nnursing is a very important part of the treatment. The sheep should be\r\ngiven a comfortable, well ventilated shed and kept as quiet as possible.\r\nIf the bowels become constipated, give two or three ounces of Castor Oil\r\nand feed sloppy food. As one attack predisposes the sheep to a second, it\r\nshould be protected from severe cold, or the other extreme, heat, for a\r\nmonth after making a complete recovery.\r\n\r\nThe following prescription will be found very beneficial: Iodide of\r\nAmmonia, one-half ounce; Chlorate of Potassi, one ounce; Pulv. Nux\r\nVomica, one ounce. Make into twenty-four powders and give one powder\r\nevery four hours well back on the tongue. Continue this treatment until\r\nthe animal has recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG WORMS, LAMB DISEASE.\r\n\r\n(_Verminous Bronchitis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to a white thread-like worm (Strongylus Filaria) varying in\r\nlength from one to three inches. The worms affect and live in the trachea\r\n(windpipe) and bronchial tubes. Infected animals, in coughing, expel\r\nfertilized eggs which develop on the grass and stagnant water. The larvae\r\nare again taken up either in the drinking water or in eating grass or hay\r\ngathered on low marshy soil. Warm wet weather favors their development.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—This worm is liable to attack a number of animals at the same\r\ntime. The weakest sheep and young lambs are the first to show signs by\r\ncoughing forcibly, distressing, hacking and convulsive in character. A\r\nstringy mucus is sometimes expelled during the spasm of coughing. This\r\nmucus contains worms which can be detected, or their ova observed under\r\na magnifying glass. In the latter stages of the disease, they cough\r\nseverely at night. These attacks have a sub-acute character and prove\r\nvery exhausting. The parasite by becoming entwined in balls severely\r\naffects the animal’s breathing which is always remarkably labored in\r\nthe latter stages of the disease. The animal refuses to eat, becomes\r\nemaciated, anemic, mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth and nose become\r\nvery pale and the sheep die in convulsions from suffocation.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE TREATMENT.—Avoid grazing your sheep on low marshy soil,\r\nespecially during warm wet weather. Young lambs and weak ones are\r\nespecially susceptible to this disease.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—The writer has tried various treatments as fumigation\r\nwith different substances and injection of remedies into the windpipe\r\nby the use of a hypodermic syringe, etc., but none have proven very\r\nsuccessful, from a practical standpoint. I would recommend placing the\r\naffected animals in a tightly closed barn or shed, in the center of which\r\nplace a pan of red hot coals and cover with Sulphur.\r\n\r\nA person should remain in the barn or shed as long as he possibly can\r\nand after the fumes become so irritating that he cannot endure them\r\nany longer, he should immediately make his exit. The sheep should be\r\ncompelled to stay a minute or two longer and then quickly open the\r\ndoors and windows. Repeat this treatment once or twice a week. Feed\r\naffected animals well. Give them fresh water to drink and protect them\r\nfrom exposure. This treatment, as above described, has given very good\r\nresults, providing the parasites were not too numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAB.\r\n\r\n(_Mange_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—The mange mite (Psoroptes Communis). This parasite is equipped\r\nwith stylets which pierce the skin at the seat where the mange mite\r\npenetrates the skin, and produces small red spots followed by a blister\r\nfilled with serum, which ruptures, the serum drying and forming a small\r\nscab. It is in this way that innumerable mange mites cause the piling\r\nup of scabs thus producing a very scaly condition. As Mange advances,\r\nthe scaly patches eventually pile up until they attain the thickness of\r\none-half inch, unless these scabs have been severely rubbed.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Very easily detected, as a bunch of sheep that have been\r\nrecently infected will be uneasy or restless, rubbing against fences,\r\nposts, brush, etc., causing bunches of wool to loosen. The itching seems\r\nto be more intense at night and during warm weather. The affected animals\r\nwill even make attempts to bite themselves, due to the agony produced by\r\nthe mange mite. If the skin is examined by the aid of a magnifying glass,\r\nthe mange mite can be easily noticed, or by scraping the skin with a\r\nknife and placing the scabs on a dark paper and exposed to the warmth of\r\nthe sun, the mange mite moving about can readily be seen with the naked\r\neye. Mangy sheep become very poor and eventually die.\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.—This is important, for although the disease is treated with\r\nvery good results, the mange mite annoy the sheep until they become very\r\nweak and emaciated and the loss of wool is enormous due to the affected\r\nanimal continually rubbing against fences, brush, etc.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Consists of using various dips, as Lime and Sulphur, which is\r\nrecommended by the United States Bureau of Animal Industry. This is very\r\neffective and inexpensive. Scabby sheep should be dipped a week or ten\r\ndays after shearing; two dippings are necessary at the interval of ten\r\ndays. After dipping, move to non-infected range or pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTICK.\r\n\r\n(_Louse Fly_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—The tick that infects sheep has a very small head sunken into its\r\nround body. The head possesses a flexible trunk or snout that penetrates\r\nthe skin. Through this trunk, the ticks derive their nourishment by\r\nsucking the blood from the body of the sheep. The tick is also provided\r\nwith three pairs of legs. The female lays her young in the form of a spun\r\negg (cocoon) which is oblong in shape and brown in color. This egg is\r\ncemented to the wool of sheep where young ticks are hatched in about four\r\nto six weeks.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Long wooled sheep are more susceptible to this tick as their\r\nwool provides shelter for both the tick and its eggs. After shearing the\r\nsheep the ticks have a tendency to leave the body and to migrate to the\r\nlegs or to unshorn lambs where their snouts or trunks pierce the skin\r\nwhich appears to become infected, producing a swelling and inflammation.\r\nThe infected sheep run, scratch and bite themselves. When these ticks\r\nbecome developed in large quantities, they produce a paleness of the\r\nmucous membranes of the eyes, mouth and nose, as the ticks suck large\r\nquantities of blood, which produces an anemic condition. The sheep become\r\npoor, weak and unthrifty.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Satisfactorily treated by dipping infected sheep in Coal Tar\r\ndips or Emulsions of Crude Petroleum. Shearing the sheep has a good\r\neffect, but care must be exercised as the ticks then rapidly migrate to\r\nthe lambs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DISEASES OF\r\n                                 POULTRY\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           CAUSE, SYMPTOMS AND\r\n                                TREATMENT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCATION OF PARTS OF THE FOWL.]\r\n\r\nLOCATION OF PARTS OF THE FOWL\r\n\r\n    0.

KORINEK, V. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR SAC MITE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Produced by a parasite called Cylodites Nudus, which bears a close\r\nresemblance to the parasite causing mange or scabies in the domesticated\r\nanimal. Owing to the peculiar construction of their breathing organs\r\nfowls are more susceptible to parasites than animals. In addition to\r\neffecting the lungs, the Air Sac Mite may extend its operations to the\r\nintestines, kidneys, liver and bones.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Unthriftiness is first noticed, but after the parasites\r\nbecome numerous, the fowl shows signs of difficult breathing, perhaps\r\nterminating in bronchial pneumonia. In some cases death occurs without\r\napparent cause. The bird will be inactive, becomes separated from the\r\nrest of the flock, comb pale, head drawn close to the body, wings hang\r\npendulous, lose flesh, breathing becomes hard, coughing, sneezing and a\r\nrattling from the mucus in the windpipe is heard. Death is produced from\r\nsuffocation.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Separate the sick from the healthy fowls. Disinfect coops\r\nand runways of both sick and healthy birds with Crude Carbolic Acid,\r\nundiluted. Also fumigate the fowls in their coops with steam from hot\r\nwater and Pine Tar. This may be done by placing the water and Tar in a\r\npan and then inserting a hot stone or brick in the solution. This perhaps\r\nis the simplest method of fumigation. Also mix Sulphur in their feed\r\nregularly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY.\r\n\r\n(_Hemorrhage of the Brain_)\r\n\r\nDue to the rupture of a blood vessel of the brain and pressure from the\r\nescaping blood.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Mechanical injuries, straining when laying eggs (hens are\r\nfrequently found dead on the nest from this cause), overfeeding,\r\nstimulating food, etc., all tend to produce apoplexy.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Appear very suddenly, bird is seen to walk unsteadily, falls,\r\nor perhaps is found dead.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—In mild attacks, apply cold water or ice to fowl’s head until\r\nthoroughly cooled. Give one-half grain of Calomel, feed soft food,\r\ncompel the bird to exercise. Owing to the loss of blood a tonic will\r\nbe necessary. Pulv. Gentian Root, Pulv. Saltpeter, Capsicum and Ferri\r\nSulphate Pulv. equal parts one ounce. Mix and place one teaspoonful in\r\nfeed for every twenty-five fowls. This tonic purifies and builds up the\r\nblood, just what is needed in this particular condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nBALDNESS.\r\n\r\n(_Favus_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to fungi.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The first noticeable sign is the whitish appearance of the\r\ncomb due to gray spots about the size of a pin head. As the disease\r\nprogresses, this condition spreads to other parts of the body; the\r\nfeathers look rough and dry and break easily. The fowl grows weaker,\r\nrefuses to eat and if not properly treated, dies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the scabs by separating the feathers and using a brush.\r\nApply Sulphur Ointment. Repeat this treatment after two or three days.\r\nGreat care must be taken to prevent the fowl from chilling or taking\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAK AND THROAT OBSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Lodgment in the beak or food canal of a foreign substance, such as\r\na kernel of corn, sunflower seed, bone, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Fowl jerks its head suddenly and frequently attempts to\r\nswallow. If a close examination is made the foreign body can be felt from\r\nthe outside.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—For the removal of such obstructions, no special treatment\r\nis needed further than to use care and avoid any injury to the beak or\r\nthroat. Feed nutritious food, as wheat bran mashes and vegetables and see\r\nthat they have a liberal quantity of good pure water at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKHEAD.\r\n\r\n(_Infectious Entero Hepatitis of Turkeys_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to a protozoa taken into the system with the food or drinking\r\nwater. This parasite enters the caeca which becomes inflamed and\r\ndiscolored and the liver is enlarged and studded with yellowish spots\r\nabout the size of a pea.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Although this disease is termed Blackhead, the discoloration\r\nof the head is not necessarily present in all cases; neither is this\r\ncondition confined to this particular disease. One of the first symptoms\r\nis loss of appetite, followed in most cases by diarrhoea. The fowl\r\nbecomes weak and loses weight rapidly. Examination of the liver after\r\ndeath will determine whether or not death has been caused by Infectious\r\nEntero Hepatitis. The dead birds should be burned to prevent the spread\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Prevention is one of the most important factors as this\r\ndisease is very contagious and the protozoa once implanted in the turkey\r\nruns is almost impossible to eradicate. Provide clean, well ventilated\r\ncoops and feed clean, wholesome food and good fresh water to drink.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—Give Bismuth Salicylate and Quinine Sulphate each one\r\ngrain two to three times a day. Also mix Hyposulphite of Soda in the\r\nproportion of two to four grains to every fowl in their drinking water\r\ntwice daily. Disinfect coops and runs with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted.\r\n\r\n\r\nBODY LICE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Insanitary conditions. Communicated by direct contact.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Young chicks become emaciated and die quickly. Older birds\r\nwithstand the parasite much longer, but in time show signs of uneasiness\r\nby dusting themselves frequently. The comb and wattles become pale and\r\nbloodless, the feathers rough, dry and brittle. The birds grow weak, poor\r\nand eventually die.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Dust the birds with the following: Sulphur, one part;\r\nNapthaline, one part; Tobacco Dust, twenty-eight parts and seventy parts\r\nof middlings. Powder finely and mix well together and dust the birds once\r\ndaily. Also sprinkle freely in the dust baths.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Exposure to dampness, cold drafts of air, inhaling irritating\r\ngases, vapors or dust. The fowls should be carefully examined, as\r\nbronchitis is occasionally caused by the presence of gapeworms.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Loss of appetite, the bird moves about slowly, breathing with\r\ndifficulty and making a sort of whistling sound accompanied by a cough.\r\nAs the disease progresses, there will be a peculiar bubbling sound from\r\nbreathing due to an excessive accumulation of mucus in the windpipe. At\r\nthis stage of the disease the bird becomes very weak and if not properly\r\ntreated and cared for will rapidly lose strength, the feathers will\r\nbecome rough, head and wings droop, and the bird dies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—This disease is most satisfactorily treated by placing\r\nthe affected birds in warm, dry, well ventilated quarters, admitting\r\nsunlight if possible, but excluding all drafts of air. Feed stale bread,\r\nmiddlings, etc. Also place the fowls in a moderately air tight coop\r\nand compel them to inhale steam from hot water and Turpentine. This is\r\nreadily done by placing the water and Turpentine in a pan and then insert\r\na hot stone or brick in the solution. Force them to inhale this steam\r\nfrom twenty to thirty minutes twice a day. Also add Chlorate of Potash to\r\ntheir drinking water, one teaspoonful to every twenty-five aged fowls. To\r\nchicks add one-fourth teaspoonful to every twenty-five. If the weather\r\nis favorable and the above treatment is followed, bronchitis yields very\r\nfavorably.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUMBLE FOOT.\r\n\r\n(_Corns—Deep Bruises—Abscesses_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Sharp-edged or narrow perches which bruise the feet or where the\r\nperches are high, heavy fowls often injure their feet by alighting on\r\nstones or other hard objects.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The bird limps or hobbles about, moving with great difficulty.\r\nExamination will show the foot to be hot and tender to the touch.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Wash with clean, warm water and in some cases it is advisable\r\nto apply Hot Flaxseed poultices. When soft spots or abscesses develop,\r\nlance them with a clean, sharp knife. After abscesses and bruises are\r\nopened, treat them antiseptically by washing with a solution of Carbolic\r\nAcid, one teaspoonful to a pint of water. The foot should be bandaged to\r\nkeep out dust and dirt.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Exposure; poorly constructed coops which admit rain or drafts.\r\nWeak birds are very susceptible to Catarrh.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The bird is dull, moves about slowly, coughing or sneezing;\r\nappetite is poor, the mucous membrane of the air passage becomes inflamed\r\nand the breathing difficult, especially through the nose. The discharge\r\nfrom the nostrils at first watery, becomes mucus-like and thick and\r\nsticky, closing the nose, causing the bird to breathe wholly through the\r\nmouth with a wheezing sound.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The cause of Catarrh shows the necessity of clean and\r\ncomfortable quarters for the fowls. Keep the birds strong and vigorous by\r\nfeeding clean, nourishing food.\r\n\r\nMEDICAL TREATMENT.—To each fowl administer in their drinking water or\r\nfeed: Chlorate of Potash, one grain, twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICKEN POX.\r\n\r\n(_Sore Head—Warts_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—These diseases are due to low forms of parasites or fungi and\r\noccur most frequently in wet weather especially if the coops are leaky\r\nand allow the rain to fall on the droppings, causing mold or fungi. Poor\r\nventilation and lack of light also promotes the growth of fungi.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The disease is usually confined to the head and affects\r\nprincipally young chickens, pigeons and turkeys, but rarely ducks and\r\ngeese. The infection appears in form of yellowish warts or nodules about\r\nthe nose, eyelids, comb, wattles, under the wings, or any unfeathered\r\nplace. The warts vary in size from that of a pin head to the size of a\r\npea and they discharge a fluid which at first is thin and watery but as\r\nthe disease progresses, it becomes thick and sticky, yellow in color and\r\nfetid in smell. At this stage the appetite is poor, the feathers appear\r\nrough, and where the eyelids are affected, as in most cases, the bird\r\ncannot see, fails to eat, becomes emaciated, loses weight and strength\r\nrapidly and if not properly treated, dies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—This disease is very contagious, therefore the coops and\r\nruns should be disinfected with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted. In the\r\ndrinking water add Hyposulphite of Soda in the proportion of one to two\r\ngrains to each fowl (one-half grain to chicks). Wash the nodules or warts\r\nabout the head with Carbolic Acid solution, one teaspoonful to a quart of\r\nwater. Feed easily digested food, such as vegetables or warm bran mashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE LIVER.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Lack of exercise, overfeeding, tainted or moldy food, infection,\r\nor impure blood.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Birds suffering from this disease seldom show signs of sickness\r\nand it is well to dissect the fowl after death to ascertain the exact\r\ncause. If death is caused by Congestion of the Liver, the organ will be\r\ngreatly enlarged and easily torn.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—If the fowls are fat and sluggish, compel them to exercise by\r\ndriving them about. Also give fifteen to twenty grains of Epsom Salts\r\nto each affected fowl. Feed laxative foods that are easily digested, as\r\nvegetables and warm bran mashes. They are cooling and relieve congestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\n(_Pulmonary Congestion_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Exposure; the bird chills, causing contraction of the blood\r\nvessels near the surface of the body, thereby forcing a large quantity of\r\nblood to the internal organs; the small blood vessels in the lungs become\r\ndistended with blood and rupture.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Rapid and difficult breathing; the bird appears stupid and\r\nsleepy and does not care to move about; appetite poor, wings drooping,\r\nplumage ruffled, a thick mucus, colored with blood, escapes from the\r\nmouth, comb and wattles show a dark-red color from lack of oxygen in the\r\nblood. This disease is of very short duration, the bird dying within a\r\nfew hours. It is very common among young chicks and turkeys that are\r\npermitted to run out in the early spring rains.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Medical treatment is of no value, as the disease progresses\r\nso rapidly that the bird dies shortly after the first symptoms appear.\r\nSanitary surroundings, good light, pure air and exercise are essential.\r\nDo not allow the birds to stand out in the cold or rains, especially\r\nduring the molting season. Keep your poultry strong and vigorous by\r\nfeeding clean, nourishing food and give them pure water to drink.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\n(_Intestinal Obstruction_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritation of the membranes lining the intestines, caused by dry\r\nfeed, glass or gravel; may also be due to parasitic worms. Obstruction\r\nmay occur in any part of the intestines although the external opening is\r\nthe part most frequently affected.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Bird appears dull and stupid, walks with difficulty and\r\nattempts frequently to expel the obstructing material. The appetite\r\nis poor and the feathers rough. By examination and manipulation the\r\nobstruction may be located. Dried masses of excrement by adhering to the\r\nfeathers sometimes block the outer opening of the intestines.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the waste matter clinging to the feathers with warm\r\nwater or by clipping the feathers off. If the Cloaca is obstructed, give\r\ninjections of Sweet Oil or Olive Oil with a small bulb syringe. Also\r\ngive one to two grains of Calomel and feed clean food and soft mashes\r\ncontaining Pulv. Gentian Root, one grain to each fowl twice daily. This\r\nstimulates the worm-like movement of the bowels and assists in expelling\r\ntheir contents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROP IMPACTION.\r\n\r\n(_Obstruction, Paralysis, Inflammation, Catarrh_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Errors in feeding; birds that are not fed regularly are\r\npredisposed to any of the above conditions; may also be due to swallowing\r\nlarge pieces of bone, thread, nails, pins, glass, gravel, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Loss of appetite, frequent attempts to swallow, crop greatly\r\ndistended and hard on pressure; eventually the food decomposes and a\r\nliquid may escape from the mouth and nose. The bird appears dull, stupid\r\nand sleepy, comb pale, feathers rough, beak open, owing to pressure on\r\nthe windpipe. If caused by swallowing sharp objects, they may penetrate\r\nthe crop and skin, causing a gangrenous condition. Grain in the crop will\r\nsometimes send out sprouts of considerable lengths.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—If no sharp objects are present, give two teaspoonfuls\r\nof Sweet or Olive Oil. This will lubricate the esophagus and crop.\r\nManipulate the crop upward, forcing the food gently through the mouth,\r\nadding oil occasionally. If, however, sharp objects penetrate the crop\r\nit is best to remove them through an artificial opening. Clip the\r\nfeathers from around the intended seat of operation and wash the clipped\r\nsurface with a Carbolic Solution, one teaspoonful to a pint of water. The\r\nincision should not be over one-half inch long and should be made as high\r\nas possible and in the center of the crop. After removing the contents,\r\nsew up with ordinary thread and needle and wash occasionally with the\r\nabove antiseptic solution. The operation is not difficult and will be\r\nsuccessful if the parts are not too badly inflamed.\r\n\r\nAfter-treatment consists of feeding very little food until the crop is\r\nfairly well healed. Feed soft bran mashes and vegetables. To the drinking\r\nwater add Boracic Acid, one grain, twice daily. It relieves the catarrhal\r\ncondition that is present, such as irritations of the crop and intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.\r\n\r\n(_Gastro-Intestinal Catarrh—Enteritis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Inflammation of the digestive organs can be traced in every\r\ninstance to the quality or quantity of food and water consumed. The food\r\nor water may contain parasites, or large quantities of mustard, pepper,\r\nor may be moldy or tainted.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Loss of appetite, the feathers appear rough, the crop is\r\nsometimes paralyzed and distended with gas, the bird moves slowly, the\r\ndroppings vary in color from a white to a yellow or a green and finally\r\nbecomes tinged with blood; at this stage there is a rise in temperature\r\naccompanied by great thirst and signs of pain. Mild cases of simple\r\ndiarrhoea if not properly treated when first symptoms appear, will\r\ndevelop the same severe conditions described above.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Determine the cause and remove it if possible. See that\r\nthe food is clean and nutritious, the coops well ventilated, the runs\r\nwell lighted. Sunlight is very beneficial. Avoid exposures, drafts and\r\ndampness. Place oatmeal in their drinking water, also give two grains of\r\nBismuth mixed with dough and make into a small pill. Give one every six\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWhen in addition to the above symptoms a bloody discharge is present,\r\ngive six drops of Tincture of Catechu every four hours. Warm mashes made\r\nof bran or oatmeal are very nourishing and soothing to the intestinal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHERETIC ROUP.\r\n\r\n(_Diphtheria_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to a specific germ. The disease is very contagious and\r\nis communicated by direct contact. Great care should be exercised,\r\ntherefore, when showing or buying birds. Any new birds to be added to the\r\nflock should be kept in separate pens for a week or two to make sure they\r\nare in good condition.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The first symptoms are similar to those of catarrh or cold.\r\nA clear, watery liquid escapes from the eyes and nostrils, the head\r\nis drawn in toward the body, the feathers appear rough, the breathing\r\nfast, the temperature rises from three to five degrees above normal.\r\nThe bird walks about as if blind, sneezing, swallowing with difficulty,\r\nand showing signs of great weakness. If the mouth is open small white\r\nspots or elevations will be seen on the back of the tongue. There may\r\nbe diarrhoea of a green or yellow color. As the disease progresses the\r\ndischarge from the nose and eyes becomes thick and stringy, obstructing\r\nthe air passages and gathering in large quantities between the eyelids.\r\nThe mouth, throat and tongue are very much inflamed and swollen and in\r\nmost cases it is impossible for the bird to make a sound. Recovery is\r\ndoubtful after the disease has reached this stage.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Isolate the affected birds in some clean, warm, light, well\r\nventilated quarters, excluding drafts. Dissolve thirty grains of Chlorate\r\nof Potash in one ounce of water and one ounce of Glycerine, and to the\r\naverage sized fowl give one teaspoonful three or four times a day. To\r\nchicks give one-fourth the dose. When the scum loosens in the back part\r\nof the tongue, remove gently. Care should be taken so as to prevent\r\nbleeding. Feed soft, nourishing food.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUBLE-YOLK EGGS.\r\n\r\nEggs are frequently found with two yolks. This condition is produced by\r\ntwo ovary capsules bursting at about the same time and gaining entrance\r\ntogether into the oviduct where they are concealed in the same shell.\r\nDouble-yolked eggs are larger than normal and may injure the oviduct when\r\nexpelled. When hatched they produce twins or abnormal chicks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY.\r\n\r\n(_Ascites_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Generally due to irritating, indigestible food, causing\r\ninflammation of the membraneous lining of the intestinal cavity.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The abdomen becomes enlarged, is tender to the touch and\r\ncontains a watery fluid, the movement of which can be heard in most cases\r\nby pressure on the swollen parts. The bird appears stupid, the comb pale\r\nand the appetite poor.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Unless the bird is very valuable, treatment is not advisable.\r\nIn case the bird is valuable, give one grain of Potassium Iodide twice\r\ndaily in the feed or drinking water. Also feed nourishing food as\r\nbeef-scraps, vegetables, wheat bran mashes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG BOUND.\r\n\r\n(_Difficult Laying; Obstruction of the Oviduct_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to the eggs being too large, the bird too fat, or to the\r\nabsence of the secretions lubricating the oviduct.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The first signs are scarcely noticeable but soon the feathers\r\nappear rough, the bird becomes dull and moves slowly, making frequent\r\nefforts to expel the egg.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the egg by injecting Sweet Oil, assisting the bird\r\nwith gentle pressure. In some cases it is well to puncture the egg and\r\ncollapse the shell. If the bird is very fat, reduce by careful feeding.\r\nIf the bird is of normal size, the trouble is probably due to the absence\r\nof lubricating secretions of the oviduct, in which case the following\r\ntonic should be given: Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, Pulv. Gentian Root, each\r\none dram. Mix and make into thirty powders. Give one powder two or three\r\ntimes a day in their feed for a week or ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGG EATING.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Is usually due to lack of shell-building material in the food; in\r\nsuch case the shell of the egg is thin and easily broken and the fowl\r\ncraving the lime contained in the egg shell, naturally contracts the\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Supply ground bone and oyster shells. Feed green food such as\r\ncabbage, kale, potatoes, carrots, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nEGGS WITHOUT SHELLS.\r\n\r\n(_Soft-Shelled Eggs_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Deficiency of shell material; or it is possible that fright\r\nsometimes causes premature expulsion of the eggs before the shell is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Feed ground bone, oyster shells. They contain egg shell\r\nproducing material. Perhaps the best results are obtained when mixed with\r\nwheat bran. Also feed vegetables such as cabbage, potatoes and carrots.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATHER PULLING.\r\n\r\n(_Feather Eating_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritation of the skin due to lice, mites, or to lack of exercise\r\nand improper food.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Feed meat, ground bones and vegetables. Place the food where\r\nthe fowls are compelled to scratch and work to obtain it. Dust the fowls\r\nwith Powdered Aloes.\r\n\r\nIf due to lice, treat the same as recommended under the heading of Lice.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAPES.\r\n\r\n(_Verminous Trachea Bronchitis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—A red, parasitic worm, the male measuring about one-fifth of an\r\ninch and the female one-half an inch in length. Fowls become infected\r\nby eating worms containing this parasite or its eggs, and by coming in\r\ncontact with other birds suffering from the disease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The most noticeable symptom is frequent gaping; the Gapeworms\r\nattach themselves by their mouths to the walls of the windpipe where\r\nthey suck the blood which nourishes them; they cause irritation and\r\ninflammation of the windpipe, bronchial tubes and lungs; breathing is\r\ndifficult and the bird loses strength rapidly; windpipe eventually\r\nbecomes totally obstructed and the bird dies from suffocation and\r\nexhaustion. Young, weak chickens are more susceptible to this disease\r\nthan strong ones.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Separate the sick birds from the healthy ones. Clean and\r\ndisinfect the coops and runs. Burn all manure. Remove the worms from the\r\nwindpipe by the use of a feather, from which the fan has been stripped,\r\nleaving only a small brush at the end. Dip the feather into Oil of\r\nTurpentine or Coal Oil, removing the surplus liquid by drawing the\r\nfeather between the fingers. Now insert the feather into the windpipe of\r\nthe bird and by turning gently you will dislodge the worms from their\r\nattachments. Repeat this treatment once a day for two or three days.\r\nDisinfect coops and runs with undiluted Crude Carbolic Acid. Feed good\r\nnutritious food as wheat bran mashes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAD LICE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Result of insanitary conditions and lack of care. Communicated by\r\ndirect contact with infected birds, or by infected coops or brooders.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The head soon becomes denuded of feathers, and also sore by\r\nbeing constantly scratched with the feet. If not properly treated the\r\nchicks weaken and die.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—An ointment made of one part Sulphur and four parts Lard well\r\nmixed and applied two to three times will exterminate the lice. If the\r\nfowl is run down in condition, feed good nutritious food as wheat bran\r\nmashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO FEED YOUNG POULTRY.\r\n\r\nWithhold all food for at least eighteen hours; then feed stale bread\r\nmoistened with boiled milk every three hours. When they are three or\r\nfour days old, feed rolled oats, ground corn moistened with pure water,\r\nfinely chopped meat and boiled vegetables. Feed them often and you will\r\nbe well repaid by their rapid growth, strength, and the low death rate.\r\nAfter they reach the age of one week or ten days, watch them closely and\r\nregulate their feed to their apparent needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCOMPLETE EGG.\r\n\r\n(_Abortion_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritation of the oviduct; improper secretion of albumen or\r\ninternal egg-producing material.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Careful feeding will overcome this condition. Warm wheat bran\r\nmashes, ground bone, beef scraps, all tend to allay the irritations of\r\nthe oviduct and stimulate the secretions of albumen.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Obstruction of the bile duct, due to rich, nitrogenous food and\r\ninsufficient exercise.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Disease is not easily detected. The yellow color of the wattles\r\nand comb is the first symptom; the appetite is variable, the feathers\r\nappear rough and dry, the head is retracted, and the bird finally dies\r\nowing to the absorption of bile in the blood.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Change food. Feed upon a vegetable diet, also give one grain\r\nof Calomel, which is particularly useful in a case of sluggish liver\r\nin poultry. Also give one grain of Pulv. Gentian Root and one grain of\r\nBicarbonate of Soda, twice daily in feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE.\r\n\r\n(_Scabies of the Body_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to a parasite that resembles the mite.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—When the affected bird is closely examined large quantities of\r\nscales or scabs are found in the soft feathers. The appetite is poor;\r\nthe bird walks slowly about showing signs of uneasiness. If the disease\r\nis allowed to run its course, the bird grows weak and eventually dies.\r\nThe disease is easily transmitted from one bird to another and should be\r\ntreated without delay.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Disinfect roost, coops and pens with undiluted Crude Carbolic\r\nAcid. Apply to the irritations that present themselves on the body of the\r\nbirds: Sulphur Ointment twice a week and feed good nourishing food as\r\nwheat bran mashes and vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIP.\r\n\r\n(_Inflammation of the Mouth_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritations, injuries, or micro-organisms. It is sometimes caused\r\nby nothing more than a dry condition of the mucous membrane due to the\r\nbird breathing through the mouth when suffering from respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Dryness of the mucous membrane of the mouth; especially the\r\npart covering the tongue, which becomes hard and ragged, forming rough\r\nedges along its sides. These dried portions become loose and partially\r\ndetached from the tongue, interfering with its movements and causing more\r\nor less pain and annoyance.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Do not forcibly detach these pieces, but assist nature to\r\nremove them. This can be accomplished by mixing Glycerine and Water,\r\nequal parts, and dropping into the mouth with an ordinary syringe or\r\ndropper. It is advisable to add Boracic Acid, one teaspoonful to every\r\ngallon of drinking water, which will prevent the entrance of parasites\r\ninto the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED MITE.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—These grow spontaneously in favorable surroundings, as the\r\ninterior of poultry houses and brooders containing numerous cracks and\r\ncrevices.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—This mite is a blood-sucker; irritates the skin and sometimes\r\ncauses sores to form on the body of the chick. The birds grow stupid and\r\nweak and die rapidly if not properly treated. Older fowls withstand the\r\nirritation of mites much longer, but do not thrive, or lay regularly, and\r\nwill finally die if the insects become too numerous. The insect may be\r\ntransmitted to horses, cattle, and even to man.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Paint the roosts and spray the interior of the coops and runs\r\nwith Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted, being very careful that the solution\r\nreaches the bottoms of the cracks and crevices. Also paint the interior\r\nof brooders with the same solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM.\r\n\r\n(_Leg Weakness—Gout—Paralysis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Damp coops and pens, lack of ventilation and improper food.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Fowl refuses to stand or walk, and on examination, the legs are\r\nfound to be swollen and painful, especially about the joints. In some\r\ncases suppuration of the joints takes place and they become open running\r\nsores. The bone finally becomes diseased and the fowl dies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive measures are first to be considered. See that the\r\ncoops and pens are clean and dry. Avoid drafts. Feed vegetables, also\r\nwheat bran mashes. Give internally Salicylic Acid, one-half grain, twice\r\ndaily. When the legs are swollen and sore apply Zinc Ointment once or\r\ntwice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALY LEG.\r\n\r\n(_Scabies_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to a mite that burrows under the scales of the leg.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—White, scaly-looking scabs form about the upper part of the\r\nfoot. The feet and legs become swollen and painful as the disease\r\nprogresses and if not checked will result in lameness, inflammation of\r\nthe joints, and the toes may slough off. Great care is necessary as the\r\ndisease is very easily transmitted from one bird to another.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Use boiling water or Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted, on the\r\nperches. Wash the feet and legs with warm water and soft soap. Dry well\r\nand apply Carbolated Ointment. Repeat the above treatment every other day\r\nfor a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE MOUTH.\r\n\r\n(_Aphtha; Thrush_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—A vegetable parasite called Oidium Albicans.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the mouth, throat,\r\ngullet and crop, which finally terminates in white ulcerations. Other\r\nsymptoms are swelling of the head, poor appetite and a rapid loss in\r\nweight and strength.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Isolate the sick from the healthy fowls. Give as much sunlight\r\nas possible, feed nourishing food, such as warm oatmeal mashes, kale,\r\npotatoes, etc. Add one grain each of Chlorate of Potash and Boracic Acid\r\nto a tablespoonful of water and give three or four times a day or oftener\r\nif they will drink it. A good disinfectant must be used to prevent the\r\ndisease from spreading and I would recommend the use of undiluted Crude\r\nCarbolic Acid about the coops and poultry runs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—This dreaded disease is caused by the Bacillus of Tuberculosis.\r\nDamp, ill-ventilated, and poorly-lighted coops are favorable to the\r\ndevelopment of the disease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Except in advanced stages, this disease is not easily detected\r\nas it affects various organs, and considerable experience in post-mortems\r\nand a skillful use of the microscope is required to successfully diagnose\r\na case.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive measures should be practiced as the disease is\r\nincurable. Do not expose the fowls to cold wet weather. See that the\r\ncoops are well ventilated and lighted and feed no contaminated food.\r\n\r\n\r\nVENT GLEET.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Constipation is perhaps the most common cause, the hard droppings\r\ncausing irritation of the vent which is followed by inflammation and\r\nsuppuration of the membranes lining the rectum and oviduct.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Frequent straining due to irritation. As the disease progresses\r\na pus-like discharge is noticed. The disease may extend into the rectum\r\nor oviduct. The bird appears stupid, the plumage rough, the comb pale,\r\nand if not properly treated, dies a lingering death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive treatment is the best. Feed green food occasionally\r\nand warm bran mashes. This prevents constipation. When the bird strains\r\nfrequently and a discharge is present the following solution should be\r\ninjected: Sugar of Lead, two drams; Zinc Sulphate, one dram. Mix with two\r\nquarts of water. Inject about one ounce with a syringe twice daily until\r\nthe discharge has ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE DIARRHOEA.\r\n\r\n(_Fowl Cholera_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Germ (Bacilli of Fowl Cholera) gaining entrance to the body\r\nthrough the bowels, lungs or wounds of the skin. Death results from\r\ntoxic material produced while the germs are multiplying.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—All poultry, cage or wild birds are subject to this disease.\r\nThe first symptoms are loss of appetite; diarrhoea is present and the\r\ndischarge is almost white in color and tinged with transparent mucus. The\r\naffected bird becomes separated from the flock, seems weak and stupid and\r\nappears to be asleep; feathers are rough, the wings droop and the head\r\nis drawn in toward the body; crop is generally full, owing to improper\r\ndigestion. The comb is pale and bloodless, the temperature raised from\r\nthree to five degrees above normal and the bird loses weight rapidly; it\r\nmay die with convulsions and cries, or without a sound or struggle.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—To grown fowls, give Zinc Sulphocarbolates in one-half grain\r\ndoses three times a day in their food or drinking water. To chicks,\r\ndissolve thirty grains of Zinc Sulphocarbolates in two quarts of water.\r\nSaturate feed, as stale bread, etc., and give three times a day. Zinc\r\nSulphocarbolates is an antiseptic especially prepared for septic\r\nconditions of the intestines, and very useful in treatment of White\r\nDiarrhoea and Fowl Cholera. In severe cases of diarrhoea, give Bismuth\r\nSalicylate, one grain, three times daily in feed or make into a pill with\r\ndough. When the fowls will eat, feed them clean, nitrogenous food that\r\nthey can digest easily, as oatmeal mashes. It is also necessary to give\r\nthem pure water to drink at all times. Disinfection of the premises is\r\nanother essential factor in the treatment of this disease, and undiluted\r\nCrude Carbolic Acid is a disinfectant that we can rely upon at all times.\r\n\r\nI cannot recommend vaccination as the serum is very difficult and\r\nexpensive to produce and different breeds of birds require varying doses,\r\ntherefore, vaccinating poultry for White Diarrhoea or Fowl Cholera is not\r\nattended with any great degree of success.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS.\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Few fowls are entirely free from worms. The soil over which the\r\nchicks are permitted to run may be infected, or the food may contain the\r\neggs or embryos of worms.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The presence of worms in fowls may not be at once detected,\r\nsince only a close observer would notice them in the droppings. If the\r\nbirds eat well but remain poor, and the feathers appear rough and the\r\ncomb and wattles pale, there is reason to suspect the existence of worms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive treatment is the best. Sprinkle the runs and\r\ncoops regularly with Crude Carbolic Acid, undiluted. Give two drops of\r\nTurpentine in twice this quantity of Sweet or Olive Oil. This dose should\r\nbe repeated in from six to eight days so as to insure the expulsion\r\nof the newly hatched worms or those that may have survived the first\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DISEASES OF THE\r\n                                   DOG\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                           CAUSE, SYMPTOMS AND\r\n                                TREATMENT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCATION OF PARTS OF DOG.]\r\n\r\nLOCATION OF PARTS OF DOG\r\n\r\n    1.

KORINEK, V. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESSES OF THE EAR.\r\n\r\n(_Haematoma_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Irritations or injuries to the ear. Washing dogs with irritating\r\nsoap and not properly drying them causes dogs to have an itchy sensation\r\nwhich they constantly aggravate by scratching the ear with the paw and\r\nshaking the head and flopping the ears violently, resulting in this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The dog will be noticed carrying the head to one side and\r\nshaking it frequently in a violent manner. It will also scratch the\r\near with the paw involuntarily. When the inner surface of the ear is\r\ncarefully examined it will be found extremely swollen and have an\r\nabnormal appearance, will be stiff and extend out from the head. Great\r\nheat and pain will be evinced when pressure is applied. The puffy\r\nswelling inside the ear will contain a serous fluid which is very\r\noffensive in odor.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—With a clean, sharp knife open the abscess and allow the\r\nbloody fluid to escape. Then dress the wound twice a day with clean\r\ncotton and a solution made from Tincture of Iodine, one dram, to one-half\r\nounce of water. To prevent the dog from scratching and flopping the ears,\r\nwhich would cause further irritation, bind the ears to the head by means\r\nof a bandage or hood. Feed clean, wholesome, laxative food and compel him\r\nto exercise, as good physical condition and clean surroundings assist\r\nmaterially in healing wounds of the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY\r\n\r\n(_Congestion of the Brain_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Congestion or rupture of the blood vessels of the brain, which\r\ncauses a sudden arrest of sense and motion, the dog lying as if in a\r\ndeep sleep. It seldom attacks young, but occurs frequently in fat dogs,\r\nespecially if aged and not accustomed to exercise.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—They are very hard to detect, as the dog generally becomes\r\nunconscious before any violent symptoms are noticed, but there is\r\ngenerally unsteadiness in the walk, dizziness, deafness, blindness,\r\nconstipation, etc., preceding an attack, but only a careful observer will\r\nnotice them.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—As this is a very dangerous disease, no time should be\r\nlost. The first thing is to relieve the head from the accumulation of\r\nblood to prevent further congestion and avoid inflammatory action. To\r\naccomplish this place the head well up and apply cold to the head by\r\nmeans of pounded ice in a cloth bag. Loosen the collar around the neck\r\nand apply hot packs to the feet to induce the flow of blood to the lower\r\nextremities. Also give a physic consisting of one to two grains of\r\nCalomel. After the dog recovers from the fit great care will be required\r\nto prevent a second attack. The diet should be light and nutritious.\r\nAlways avoid feeding too large a quantity at one time, to prevent\r\noverloading of the stomach. Also avoid excitement or excessive exercise\r\non a hot day. A cathartic as Calomel should be administered when a dog\r\nshows any signs of constipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTHMA\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—In some instances I believe it is hereditary, although in others\r\nno influence of this nature can be discovered. This affection frequently\r\nfollows organic diseases of the chest. The spasms of difficult breathing\r\nmay be directly due to irritants inspired into the lungs, such as smoke,\r\ngas, or dust and cold air containing infectious matter. Overfeeding\r\nfrequently produces this condition, as an abnormal distention of the\r\nstomach presses against the lungs and causes them to become inactive\r\nand spasmodic contraction of the muscular fibers of the bronchial tubes\r\nfollows. Dogs with narrow chest cavities are predisposed to asthma, which\r\ncondition is hereditary.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—This disease is attended with difficulty of breathing and\r\na sensation of constriction of the chest, giving rise to wheezing,\r\ncoughing and general nervousness. The animal becomes emaciated, the hair\r\nhas a rough, faded appearance, although it will continue to eat well.\r\nConstipation is generally associated with this disease.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Place the animal in clean, comfortable surroundings, exercise\r\ncarefully as violent exercise would tend to aggravate the disease. Feed\r\nsparingly on nitrogenous food that is easily digested; also administer\r\nFowler’s Solution of Arsenic, four drops, twice daily. This can be\r\nplaced on the food, as the dog will take it readily. If the bowels are\r\nconstipated, give one to two tablespoonfuls of Castor Oil. Good care and\r\ncareful feeding play a very important part in the treatment of asthma.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRENNESS\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Either the extreme of overfeeding and insufficient exercise or of\r\noverworking and insufficient supply of food. Contraction of the neck of\r\nthe womb or atrophy of the ovaries may produce barrenness. There are also\r\nother conditions that produce failure to breed, such as inflammation or\r\ngrowths in the womb or ovaries, leucorrhea, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—If due to Leucorrhea there will be a white, glary discharge\r\nfrom the vagina, which looks like curdled milk. It sometimes accumulates\r\nin the uterus and comes away in large quantities and there is a fetid\r\nsmell. The animal generally becomes debilitated. In other cases, where\r\nthere is a contraction of the womb or atrophy of the ovaries, no abnormal\r\nconditions will be noticed except that the animal fails to conceive when\r\nbred.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Use both local and constitutional treatment. Feed sparingly on\r\nnitrogenous food that is easily digested. Allow to exercise moderately\r\nand the bitch may become fertile, if no morbid conditions are present.\r\nIf the animal is constipated administer one to two ounces of Castor Oil\r\nand if in a run-down, debilitated condition give Pulv. Nux Vomica, Pulv.\r\nGinger Root, Pulv. Ferri Sulphate, each one dram. Make into thirty-two\r\ncapsules and give one capsule three times daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Sudden change of temperature, etc., choking, drenching,\r\ninhalations of irritating material as certain vapors, dust, etc.,\r\ncontaining infectious material; accumulations of gas in the stomach\r\ncontaining particles of food may be regurgitated up into the esophagus\r\nfrequently producing bronchitis.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The chief symptoms consist of fever, hurried breathing with\r\na sense of tightness about the chest, but not always acute pain. The\r\ncough is severe and dry at first, but later expectoration commences.\r\nThe discharge that is raised from the bronchial tubes at first is a\r\nclear, thin mucus, but afterwards it becomes thicker, more abundant and\r\npurulent. It is difficult for persons not accustomed to examining the\r\nchest to always distinguish the disease from pneumonia, if the case is\r\none of severity. In mild cases the symptoms need not usually occasion\r\nmuch alarm.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—This disease may be prevented frequently by giving five to\r\nten grains of Dover’s Powder as soon as it is discovered that the dog\r\nhas taken a cold. It is best given in the evening then placing the dog\r\nin a warm bed; also give some warm stimulants to drink as Tincture of\r\nCapsicum, five to fifteen drops in a teaspoonful of luke warm water. In\r\nthe morning, give one to two grains of Calomel. If the above does not cut\r\nthe disease short, then keep the dog confined to warm quarters and give\r\ninhalations of steam from hot water and Turpentine. For the cough, which\r\nis usually troublesome, give the following mixture: Potassium Chlorate,\r\none dram; Liquor Ammonia Acetate, three ounces; Vini Ipecac, two drams;\r\nTincture of Camph. Co., one-half ounce; Aqua Chloroform, quantity\r\nsufficient to make four ounces. Give one to two teaspoonfuls three or\r\nfour times daily. Also feed nutritious food that is easily digested and\r\npermit the animal to have access to pure cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS\r\n\r\nThere is considerable difference in the extent of injury from the burns\r\nproduced by hot vapors, fluids, etc. In some cases, which are only\r\nsuperficial, there will be slight inflammation or redness produced, while\r\nin others the burn may be of severity and cause the death of the skin,\r\nfollowed by sloughing.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—For Burns and Scalds of ordinary severity, I have derived\r\nexcellent results from equal parts of Raw Linseed Oil and Lime Water, as\r\nit removes the soreness and restores the part to its normal condition.\r\nIn cases where the skin is sloughed off, in addition to the above\r\nrecommended, dust with Boracic Acid, two ounces; Corn Starch, two ounces;\r\nTannic Acid, one-half ounce; Iodoform, two drams. Mix and powder finely.\r\nPlace in sifter top can and apply two or three times daily to the moist,\r\nsloughing surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANKER OF THE EAR\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Filth and dust, especially in long-eared hunting dogs, as the\r\ninner surface of the ear becomes dirty and damp from wading streams and\r\nrunning through tall, wet grass. This condition is not serious at first,\r\nbut it will irritate the dog so as to cause him to shake his head and\r\nscratch the ear with his paw. Permit no filth to enter the ear as this\r\nwill assist to develop a Canker, which becomes very painful.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The dog shakes the head violently and scratches the ears with\r\nthe paw and even howls from the severe pain produced. The ears will\r\nbe moist and have a poked-out appearance, due to the swelling. As the\r\ndisease progresses, there will be a very disagreeable discharge from\r\nthe ear that can be very easily detected some distance from the animal.\r\nUlceration eventually follows, affecting the internal structure of the\r\near, which condition is very difficult to treat.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Remove the cause, if possible. Then inject ten to fifteen\r\ndrops of the following solution: Mild Chloride of Mercury, fifteen\r\ngrains; Lime Water, four ounces. Shake well and apply to the ear as above\r\nmentioned two to three times a day. Place a small piece of cotton in the\r\near after each injection. Also place a hood over the ears or bandage them\r\ndown with a cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH\r\n\r\n(_Cold in the Head_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—The most common, perhaps, is exposure, especially after a dog has\r\nbeen used to warm closed quarters. Dogs used for hunting purposes, when\r\nin a poor condition, with their system weakened, are often victims of\r\nCatarrh.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Slight dullness. May not take food very well, hair standing\r\nto some extent, pulse not much affected, throat becomes sore. After the\r\ncongestion passes off, exudation takes place, followed by discharge and\r\nit may be very profuse, but it need not alarm you. There is generally\r\nimpaired secretion of urine, but breathing not much affected in most\r\ncases. We also have a discharge from the nose in other diseases, such as\r\nDistemper, Bronchitis, Pneumonia, etc.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The treatment should be constitutional as well as local. Place\r\nthe animal in clean, well-ventilated quarters; feed good nourishing food,\r\nwhich is quite important. The following prescription is very beneficial\r\nin suppressing the secretion from the nostrils: Ferri Hypophosphitis,\r\nfive grains; Quinine Sulphate, three grains; Pulv. Nux Vomica, two drams;\r\nArsenous Acid, one-half grain. Make into twelve capsules and give one\r\ncapsule two or three times a day. Give inhalations of steam from hot\r\nwater and Oil of Eucalyptus for one-half hour twice daily. Permit the\r\ndog to exercise if the weather is favorable. If constipated give rectal\r\ninjections and feed laxative food. Avoid giving physics in Catarrh,\r\nespecially if there is fever present.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOREA\r\n\r\n(_St. Vitus Dance_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Due to an irritation of the nervous system. It is especially\r\nassociated with debility, although it may follow constitutional diseases,\r\nsuch as Distemper, etc. It is sometimes caused by a direct injury to the\r\nbrain or spinal cord.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—A continuous twitching of the muscles which is noticeable even\r\nthough the animal sleeps. The muscles of the head may be affected, or\r\nthose of one or both fore limbs or of a hind limb. An animal affected\r\nwith Chorea will show an unsteady gait when walking and usually becomes\r\nvery poor, although it will have a very good appetite at all times.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—In severe cases the dog will not, as a rule, respond to\r\ntreatment. In milder cases, if taken in hand early, improvement may be\r\nbrought about, but seldom a complete recovery. Many drugs have been\r\ntried in the treatment of Chorea, but the superiority of one medicine\r\nover another has not been practically demonstrated. Fowler’s Solution of\r\nArsenic given in from two to eight drop doses has been tried in a large\r\nnumber of cases and in my experience it has given the best results. The\r\ndrug should be given at first in small doses and gradually increased as\r\ntolerance is established. If the physiological action of the Arsenic\r\nbecomes manifested it should be discontinued for a few days. In severe\r\ncases, Sedatives are indicated. Of these, either Bromide of Potassi or\r\nSodii should be given in ten to twenty grain doses, prepared in gelatin\r\ncapsules and administered three or four times a day. Attention to the\r\ndigestive organs and to the diet is necessary during the treatment. If\r\nthe dog is constipated one or two tablespoonfuls of Castor Oil should be\r\nadministered. Feed nitrogenous food that is easily digested and provide\r\ncomfortable sleeping quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIC\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Worms, indigestible or decomposed irritating food, compaction or\r\nobstruction, calculus, strictures of the intestines or it may be due to\r\nliver complication and animals swallowing sharp bones, etc. Several forms\r\nof poisoning may produce Colic.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The dog evinces severe abdominal pain, usually with\r\nconstipation and often vomiting. As a rule, there is no fever or\r\nquickness of the pulse. The pain, which is spasmodic, is relieved on\r\npressure as the dog prefers to lie on his abdomen in many instances. The\r\ndog frequently eats green grass as this causes him to vomit, which is\r\nnature’s method of relieving the digestive tract of irritating material.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—In cases which are not very severe, the application of hot\r\ncloths to the abdomen frequently affords relief. Ginger, ten to twenty\r\ngrains, dissolved in a teaspoonful of water may relieve a mild attack,\r\nbut when the above treatment fails the following is recommended: Fluid\r\nExtract of Cannabis Indica, one dram; Chloroform, one dram; Tincture\r\nof Capsicum, ten drops; Oil of Peppermint, ten drops; Morphine, three\r\ngrains; water, quantity sufficient to make one fluid ounce. Give ten to\r\nfifteen drops every hour, if necessary. A physic is indicated in the\r\nmajority of cases of Colic for the purpose of removing irritants or\r\nobstructions from the intestines. Calomel, one to two grains, is a very\r\nefficient drug, while Castor Oil is given with great difficulty and it\r\nshould be administered only where diarrhoea is a complication of Colic.\r\nRectal injections of warm water is very beneficial in the treatment of\r\nintestinal obstructions. It is good practice to give a dog some vermifuge\r\nafter an attack of Colic, as worms frequently produce it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Insufficient exercise, overfeeding or feeding decomposed or\r\nirritating foods. Dogs are predisposed to indigestion as they frequently\r\nswallow a large quantity of indigestible food without masticating it.\r\nPoor care and exposure to cold also frequently produce Constipation.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Constipation is often a complication of other diseases, the\r\nfeces is dry-looking and may be more or less covered with a mucus. A\r\nprominent symptom is straining, attempts to defecate, the appetite is\r\ngreatly impaired, the dog acts dull and stands with the head down or\r\ngoes off to some quiet place and lies down. Protrusion of the rectum\r\nor piles may occur, especially if the animal has eaten freely of dry,\r\nindigestible food. Colicky pains are sometimes manifested. Constipation\r\noccurring from causes other than a complication of diseases seldom takes\r\non a serious form.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—When a dog becomes constipated, all dry, indigestible food\r\nshould be withheld. A soft, easily digested diet should be fed sparingly\r\nand a liberal supply of water allowed. In some cases it is well to\r\nexercise the dog. A physic of two to four ounces of Castor Oil should\r\nbe given, but overdosing with physics avoided. The action of the physic\r\nshould be assisted by injecting into the rectum warm, soapy water. Tonics\r\nwhich assist digestion by stimulating secretions of the bowels, should be\r\nadministered, as Ferri Sulphate, one-half dram; Quinine, one-half dram;\r\nPulv. Nux Vomica, one-half dram; Gentian Root, one dram. Mix and make\r\ninto twelve capsules and give one capsule three or four times a day.\r\n\r\nThe above treatment must be persisted in until the constipated condition\r\nis relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA AND DYSENTERY\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Among the common causes of Diarrhoea and Dysentery can be\r\nmentioned irritating foods, sudden change in feed, decomposed matter,\r\nirritation from intestinal worms, imperfect mastication of food and its\r\nimperfect preparation for digestion, eating more food than the digestive\r\norgans can well digest, debilitated condition and irritation from\r\nindigestible food. The immediate cause is perhaps the irritated condition\r\nof the mucous membranes lining the intestines and a profuse secretion\r\nfrom the intestinal glands, nature’s own method of removing poisonous or\r\ninfectious matter from the digestive canal.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Undue amount of liquid feces, the dog weakly and sickly, the\r\ncoat staring and perhaps a sort of curdled fluid passes with the feces.\r\nIf the fecal matter is tinged with blood, then it is called Dysentery,\r\nand this is more serious than common Diarrhoea. These conditions are\r\ngenerally associated with other diseases and should be examined very\r\ncarefully for complications.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Treatment consists of keeping the dog as quiet as possible,\r\nfeed sparingly on clean, easily digested food, as raw eggs, etc. It may\r\nbe necessary to give a dose of physic, as Castor Oil in two to four\r\nounce doses which is an excellent remedy for expelling irritants from\r\nthe bowels without griping. After the cause or irritant from within the\r\nintestines is removed administer Protan, one-half ounce; Gum Catechu,\r\none-half ounce; Zinc Sulphocarbolates, two grains. Make into sixteen\r\ncapsules and give one capsule every four hours. This dose is prepared\r\nfor a dog weighing forty pounds. To larger dogs or puppies give the same\r\nmedicine in doses proportionate to their weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTEMPER\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Is due to a specific bacteria that is developed spontaneously,\r\nalthough I am of the opinion that insanitary surroundings, as dark, damp,\r\nill-ventilated quarters play a very active part in its causation as well\r\nas food that is decomposed, contaminated or deficient in nitrogenous\r\nmatter, or any condition that has a tendency to weaken the dog’s\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The first symptom revealed is a bad cold. The dog chills, the\r\neyes become inflamed and a thin watery discharge oozes from them as well\r\nas from the nostrils, and, as the disease progresses, this thin watery\r\ndischarge takes on a pus-like character, becomes thick, yellow, tinged\r\nwith blood, sticky and very offensive in smell. The dog vomits and has a\r\ndry, husky cough, the temperature rises from two to four degrees above\r\nnormal, the pulse considerably weakened, breathing hurried and labored\r\nand the dog walks around in a staggering stupor and may even go into\r\nconvulsions. There is also a twitching of the muscles in many cases,\r\nas in Chorea, and this disease generally follows Distemper. In other\r\ncases, the dog will lie flat on the side, breathe with great difficulty,\r\nin a half-unconscious manner. This is a very unfavorable symptom, as\r\nlung complications have developed. Constipation or diarrhoea and even\r\ndysentery that is foul in odor may accompany this disease. The dog grows\r\nvery poor, weak, the legs, nose and ears grow cold and clammy, and death\r\nfollows. When the above described symptoms are present, the dog generally\r\ndies in from two to four days. If he lives through this stage, chances\r\nare that he will develop Chorea and be of practically no value.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—As this disease runs its course in about eighteen days, good\r\nsanitary surroundings are very beneficial. Pure, fresh air, light, clean\r\nand comfortable place to lie upon are also necessary. Feed albuminous\r\nfood, as raw eggs, milk, etc. Beef broth is very beneficial in many\r\ncases; also permit the dog to have free access to pure water at all times.\r\n\r\nIf vomiting accompanies the disease, the following prescription should be\r\nadministered: Diluted Prussic Acid, nine drops; Morphine Hydrochlorate,\r\nten grains; Bismuth Nitrate, one dram; water, quantity sufficient to\r\nmake three ounces. Give one tablespoonful not oftener than six hours.\r\nThis should be given a dog weighing forty pounds. Smaller or larger\r\ndogs should receive the same medicine in doses proportionate to their\r\nweight. When constipation is present, give two to four ounces of Castor\r\nOil. The general medical treatment for Dog Distemper consists of the\r\nfollowing: Quinine Sulphate, two drams; Potassi Nitrate, three drams;\r\nZinc Sulphocarbolates, two drams. Mix well and make into twenty-four\r\ncapsules and give one capsule every two or three hours. This dose\r\nshould be proportionately increased in dogs weighing over forty pounds,\r\nor decreased for dogs weighing less than forty pounds. Of course a\r\ndifference of five pounds should not be considered. Bathe the nose and\r\neyes several times daily in a five per cent solution of Boracic Acid.\r\nWhen complications, as Chorea or Pneumonia develop, use the treatments as\r\ndescribed under their respective headings.\r\n\r\n\r\nECZEMA\r\n\r\n(_Surfeit_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Derangements of the digestive canal, dogs recovering from\r\ndistemper, or a bitch after whelping, is predisposed to Eczema. Dogs\r\nexposed to a sudden chilling of the surface of the body, when heated,\r\nfrequently develop Surfeit. Sometimes dogs confined to poorly ventilated,\r\ndamp kennels develop Eczema, or Surfeit. In fact, any condition that\r\ntends to cause a sluggishness of the circulation produces impure blood,\r\nand eruptions of the skin naturally follow as a result.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—This disease generally affects the neck, back, inside the\r\nthighs, arms and the abdomen. The skin becomes red, painful to the touch,\r\nsmall pimples form and serum oozes from them. This gradually spreads and\r\nthe skin becomes raw and ulcerated. The dog will continue to scratch and\r\nbite himself violently, producing further irritation, if not properly\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Internal treatment is just as essential as applications to\r\nthe skin. Digestive and blood disorders must be eradicated before the\r\nouter surface of the body will yield to a treatment. Internally, give\r\nFowler’s Solution of Arsenic, two to eight drops, three times daily in\r\nthe food. The drug should be given at first in small doses and gradually\r\nincreased as tolerance is established. If the bowels are sluggish, give\r\none to three grains of Calomel. This will relieve any irritant in the\r\nalimentary canal. Feed food that is easily digested, as vegetables, Cod\r\nLiver Oil, etc. Beef Broth is beneficial, but a heavy meat diet should\r\nbe discontinued. To the irritated surface of the skin, the following is\r\nsoothing as well as healing: Zinc Oxide, one ounce; Pisis Liquid, one\r\nounce; Mercurial Ointment, one ounce. Mix and apply sparingly once a day.\r\nPoisons are readily absorbed through the skin, therefore, be very careful\r\nwhen using powerful antiseptics over a large surface of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nEYE INJURIES\r\n\r\n(_Conjunctivitis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Direct or indirect injuries, as a blow from a whip, dust, sand or\r\nchaff in the eye, or may be due to extreme cold, or heat, or foul air.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—An inflammation of the superficial structures of the eye,\r\nwith a partial or complete closure, and a watery discharge due to the\r\noverstimulation of the lachrymal glands, the fluid being secreted so\r\nabundantly that it is impossible for the tear duct to carry it away,\r\nhence there will be a continuous flow of tears running down the side of\r\nthe dog’s face. The formation of a film or a scum over the eyes need not\r\ncause alarm if the eyeball shows no sign of being lacerated or punctured.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Examine the eye carefully and remove any foreign body with\r\na clean cloth or feather, and use a solution made from distilled water\r\ncontaining three per cent Boric Acid, and apply ten or twelve drops to\r\nthe eye by the use of an ordinary eye-dropper. Keep the animal in a\r\nclean, dark room, as it hastens recovery and avoids other serious eye\r\ncomplications.\r\n\r\n\r\nFITS\r\n\r\n(_Epilepsy_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Usually arises from excessive nervous irritation, induced by\r\ndisturbances of the stomach and bowels from the presence of worms,\r\nindigestible food, etc., or it may arise occasionally from a hereditary\r\npredisposition, sexual excess, urine irritation, or from other causes\r\ninducing extreme nervousness, irritability, etc. Dogs affected with this\r\ndisease are usually troubled with dyspepsia and constipation.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The leading symptoms of the disease are sudden loss of\r\nconsciousness, with spasms of muscles, followed by exhaustion and\r\ndrowsiness. After a certain length of time has passed, the attack\r\nreturns. About five or ten per cent of the cases give some warning for\r\na short time before the fits come on, but in most cases the fit comes\r\non suddenly, the dog whines, and at once falls to the ground senseless\r\nwith convulsions. The eyes are partly open, the eyeballs rolling, and\r\na gnawing of the teeth, foaming at the mouth; the tongue is usually\r\nextended out, and many times badly bitten. The nose is usually cold and\r\nclammy and breathing laborious. The fit usually lasts from a few minutes\r\nto one-half hour, but in some cases continues for longer time.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The dog should be placed on a blanket to prevent inhalations\r\nof dust, etc., remove the collar from around the neck, and apply cold\r\napplications of ice to the head. The remedy most to be relied upon is\r\nBromide of Potassium, and should be given to a dog weighing forty pounds\r\nin doses of twenty grains three times a day. The dose to larger or\r\nsmaller dogs should be given in proportion to their weight. If necessary,\r\nthe dose may be increased one-third for a short time. Also give Castor\r\nOil, one to two ounces. To puppies give in proportion to their weight.\r\nPay strict attention to the organs of digestion, and see that the\r\nnourishment taken is sufficient to nourish the body well, but be careful\r\nnot to have an over-amount at one time. Also regulate the feed so as to\r\nalways have five or six hours elapse between feeds. It is advisable to\r\ngive a vermifuge in all cases of fits, as worms are frequently producers\r\nof the malady.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES\r\n\r\n(_Bone Fractures_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—There are several different varieties of fractures, but for\r\nconvenience sake I will divide them into four varieties:\r\n\r\n1. Simple fracture is one in which a bone is broken and the muscles and\r\nskin are not severely injured.\r\n\r\n2. Compound fracture is one in which the sharp ends of the broken bone\r\npenetrate and perhaps pass through the skin. This is considered a rather\r\nsevere fracture.\r\n\r\n3. Comminuted fracture is one in which a broken bone is badly shattered.\r\n\r\n4. Complicated fracture is one in which important articular joints and\r\nlarge arteries are injured.\r\n\r\nSome people imagine that the bones of the dog will not unite as quickly\r\nas the bones of man, but I am of the opinion that they will unite quicker\r\nif the bones are properly placed and the animal kept quiet. I will admit\r\nthat fractures are somewhat troublesome to treat in some cases, although\r\nI have seen dogs with severe fractures make good recoveries without any\r\nassistance other than that of nature. In treating a fracture where the\r\nbones penetrate the skin, cut the hair from around the surface and wash\r\nwith a five per cent solution of Carbolic Acid. Place the broken bones\r\nin position, wrap the surface with a thin layer of cotton and retain the\r\nbones in position with splints and bandages. Keep the animal as quiet as\r\npossible and feed on soft laxative good. If bowels become constipated,\r\ngive two to four ounces of Castor Oil. If severe swelling follows in a\r\nfew days, and the dog shows signs of great pain, remove the bandage and\r\nwash clean with an antiseptic. Then place fresh cotton around the part\r\nand bandage the same as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOITER\r\n\r\n(_Bronchocele_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Generally associated with a debilitated condition of a heavy\r\npregnant bitch that is poorly fed, and exposed to various temperatures.\r\nThe offspring of such a bitch are very often victims of Goiter. When\r\nthe puppies are born the mother’s milk lacks sufficient nitrogenous\r\nproperties; they are consequently deprived of mineral matter and develop\r\nGoiter. Some writers hold that this is hereditary, because one or more\r\npuppies become affected at the same time. I believe that it is due to\r\ndebility, starvation, and what produces it in one dog will produce it in\r\nanother. Although full-grown dogs are often victims of Goiters, it is\r\ndue to some debilitated condition drawing on their systems. Even though\r\nthe dog looks well, and appears to be in good condition, his food may be\r\ndeficient in mineral properties.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Enlargement of the Thyroid bodies of the ductless gland\r\nsituated on the under surface of the neck. It may vary from the size\r\nof a pigeon’s egg to the size of a man’s two fists. It is very easily\r\ndetected, and does not often interfere with the animal’s breathing unless\r\nit becomes abnormally large and causes pressure on the windpipe, jugular\r\nvein and esophagus. A dog affected with Goiter does not thrive, his hair\r\nlooks faded, dusty and rough.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Administer Adrenolin twice daily in five to ten grain doses\r\nhalf an hour before feeding, and two to five grains of Potassium Iodide\r\ntwo times daily shortly after feeding. The Potassium Iodide should be\r\ndiscontinued when the skin scales, or when an abnormal watery discharge\r\nfrom the eyes is present. To the enlargement apply Tincture of Iodine\r\nonce a day with a camelhair brush. If the dog has long hair, clip it off\r\nfrom over the enlargement. Feed the dog on nitrogenous foods, as raw\r\neggs, Cod Liver Oil, Beef Broth, and also supply him with soft bones to\r\nchew. Where the bowels are constipated, give one to two ounces of Castor\r\nOil. The above medicines prescribed are prescribed for dogs weighing\r\nforty pounds, and should be increased when given to larger, or decreased\r\nwhen given to smaller dogs proportionately to their weight. See that the\r\ndog has clean, light and well ventilated quarters to sleep in.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION\r\n\r\n(_Dyspepsia_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Intestinal worms, indigestible and unnutritious food, foreign\r\nbodies in the stomach, eating too large a quantity or, in many cases,\r\neating too fast, torpidity of the liver, derangements of the teeth, as\r\nthe accumulations of tartar cause the gums to become soft and sore,\r\nresulting in the dog not taking sufficient time to chew food properly;\r\nexcessive or inexcessive exercise, or improper attention to the hygienic\r\nsurroundings often derange the digestive system.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The appetite is depraved, the dog eats grass freely, and vomits\r\noften; colicky pains, persistent constipation and bloating, causing the\r\ndog serious inconvenience. He is irritable, dull and evidently out of\r\nsorts; his coat looks faded and feels rough; the temperature and pulse\r\nare not much affected; as a rule the breath is foul, the tongue covered\r\nwith a whitish fur, loss of flesh occurs, and paleness of the skin.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Good hygiene, careful feeding of nitrogenous foods and regular\r\nexercise plays a very important part in the treatment of indigestion.\r\nFirst, endeavor to clean out the Alimentary Canal by the careful use of\r\nphysics, as Calomel in one to three grain doses. Feed raw eggs, sweet\r\nmilk, boiled vegetables, fresh raw beef finely chopped. Also give one\r\ntablespoonful of Cod Liver Oil two or three times a day. I have derived\r\ngood results in the treatment of Indigestion by using the following\r\ngastric tonic: Pepsin, two ounces; Syrup of Orange, two ounces; Tincture\r\nof Columbia, five drams; Tincture Nux Vomica, one dram; Tincture Gentian,\r\none dram; water, quantity sufficient to make six ounces. Mix and give\r\none or two teaspoonfuls three times daily before feeding. In cases where\r\nthere is great difficulty in the dog passing the feces, give rectal\r\ninjections of soap and warm water.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE\r\n\r\n(_Liver Congestion_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—A sluggishness of the liver, or by the bile duct becoming\r\nobstructed by a Calculi (Gall Stone). Either condition suppresses the\r\nflow of bile into the bowels, hence the bile is taken up by the blood\r\nand causes the visible mucous membranes of the eyes and mouth to become\r\nyellowish in color. The predisposing causes are improper and overfeeding,\r\ncombined with lack of exercise in house dogs, or excessive exercise\r\nin hunting dogs, exposure to damp, ill-ventilated sleeping quarters,\r\nproducing debility, and liver complications are likely to follow.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Appetite varied, thirst great, vomiting occasionally, the dog\r\nshows signs of dullness and sleepiness. Then there may be alternate\r\ndiarrhoea and constipation, the tongue coated and foul in smell, the\r\neyes, mouth, inside of the ears, and the skin inside the thighs and fore\r\nlegs become very yellow and dry, temperature and pulse not much affected,\r\nthe dog passes small quantities of dark amber colored urine frequently,\r\ndue to the bile it contains. In severe cases, the dog loses strength\r\nand flesh readily and soon becomes a mere skeleton. Jaundice is often\r\na complication of other diseases, as distemper, indigestion, colic,\r\nconstipation, etc.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Endeavor to make the dog as comfortable as possible by placing\r\nhim in quiet, clean, light and well ventilated quarters. If he is in\r\ngreat pain, apply hot applications over the seat of pain and administer\r\nCalomel, one-half grain; Podophyllin, two grains; Powdered Jalap, one\r\ndram; Powdered Rhubarb, one dram. Make into six capsules and give\r\none capsule once daily to a dog weighing forty pounds; to smaller or\r\nlarger dogs regulate the dose in proportion to their weight. The above\r\nprescription stimulates the flow of bile from the liver into the bowels,\r\nwhich is very important in the treatment of Jaundice. Tonics are also\r\nnecessary, and I have found the following very beneficial in treating\r\nconvalescing diseases, especially where the appetite is poor: Pulv.\r\nFerri Sulphate, one dram; Quinine Sulphate, one dram; Pulv. Nux Vomica,\r\none dram; Pulv. Gentian Root, two drams. Mix and make into twenty-four\r\ncapsules and give one capsule three times daily just before feeding. This\r\ndose should be given to a dog weighing about forty pounds. Smaller or\r\nlarger dogs should receive the same medicine in doses proportionate to\r\ntheir weight. Feed raw eggs, pure sweet milk, fresh beef finely chopped,\r\ncooked vegetables, beef broth, etc. Do not feed too large a quantity at\r\nany one time.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG FEVER\r\n\r\n(_Congestion of the Lungs—Pneumonia_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Frequently occurs when dogs are accustomed to warm, comfortable\r\nquarters, then exposed to cold, drafty kennels during cold weather.\r\nIn fact, any sudden chilling of the body is a common cause of lung\r\ndisorders. Giving fat dogs too much exercise when they are not accustomed\r\nto it is frequently the cause of engorgement and inflammation of the soft\r\nspongy tissue of the lungs. Excessive exercise or running during the hot\r\nsummer months is apt to cause congestion of the lung tissue as well as\r\nheat stroke. Washing or dipping dogs during cold weather may chill the\r\nouter surface of the body and result in Congestion of the Lungs.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Lung Fever follows as a result of a bad cold, and is preceded\r\nby the symptoms of the primary disease. If due to severe exercise,\r\nthe animal appears greatly exhausted, and the congestion of the lung\r\nsubstance is marked and may occur at this stage of the disease. Lung\r\nFever usually begins with a chill, and is followed by a high fever. The\r\ndog lies down most of the time, and eats nothing, or very little. The\r\nbreathing is hurried and fast, but when the lung becomes badly involved\r\nit is labored. The character of the pulse beat varies, depending on the\r\nextent of the inflammation and the stage of the disease. In most cases\r\nthe pulse beats are full and quick during the first stage, but later,\r\nas the condition of the dog improves, more nearly normal. A very weak\r\npulse is present in severe and fatal lung inflammation. The visible\r\nmucous membranes of the eyes and mouth have a congested appearance, and\r\nthere may be a slight discharge from the nostrils, reddish in color. The\r\nexpression of the face is distressed and anxious, and in severe cases,\r\nrigors and chilling of the body occur. The respiratory sounds become\r\nmore or less changed from normal. The cough is at first deep and dry,\r\nlater loose and moist. It may be accompanied by a hemorrhage of the lungs\r\nduring the first stages of the disease. Other respiratory sounds are\r\nrevealed by placing the ear to the side of the chest wall and listening.\r\nIn the very early stages of lung fever, a crepitating, or crackling\r\nsound can be heard in the diseased parts; and louder sounds than normal\r\nin the healthy areas. Later, when the engorgement of the lung substance\r\noccurs, and the air cells become filled by the inflammatory exudation,\r\nthe respiratory sounds are deadened. On returning to the normal, rattling\r\nsounds occur. These signs aid greatly in determining the dog’s condition.\r\nThe chance for recovery depends on the extent and acuteness of the\r\ndisease. Careless handling, exercise, etc., lessens the chance for a\r\nfavorable termination in this disease, and good nursing helps more in\r\nbringing about a recovery than the medical treatment. The chances are\r\nmore unfavorable in fat dogs than in lean ones, as the inflammation is\r\nusually more severe in the former. The course of the disease is from one\r\nto three weeks, and it may become chronic if the irritation is kept up.\r\nIn such cases, unthriftiness is a prominent sign.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Preventive treatment in Lung Fever must not be overlooked.\r\nBriefly, it consists in avoiding such conditions as may predispose the\r\ndog to the disease, or act in any way as an exciting cause. Careful\r\nnursing is a very important part of the treatment. The dog should be\r\ngiven a clean, comfortable, well ventilated kennel, and kept as quiet as\r\npossible. To keep the bowels from becoming constipated, give one-half\r\nto one ounce of Castor Oil daily. Feed raw eggs, pure fresh milk, beef\r\nbroth, etc. In severe cold weather, the dog must not be permitted to\r\nchill or take more cold. Cover him with a blanket, or use artificial\r\nheat. As one attack predisposes a dog to the second, he should be\r\nprotected from severe cold, or the other extreme, heat, for a few weeks\r\nafter making a complete recovery. It is advisable to apply strong\r\nstimulating liniments over the lungs, as Aqua Ammonia Fort., one ounce;\r\nOil of Turpentine, one ounce; Sweet Oil, two ounces. Shake well and apply\r\nonce daily.\r\n\r\nI have found the following prescription very beneficial in the treatment\r\nof Lung Fever, as it regulates the heart action, lowers the temperature\r\nand stimulates the body in general: Tincture Digitalis, one dram;\r\nTincture Nux Vomica, one dram; Nitrous Ether, two drams; Liq. Ammonia\r\nAcet., four drams; water, quantity sufficient to make four ounces. Give\r\none teaspoonful every two or three hours.\r\n\r\nAll drugs prescribed in the above treatment are based on a dog weighing\r\nforty pounds. Larger or smaller dogs should receive the same medicine but\r\nin doses proportionate to their weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMITIS\r\n\r\n(_Garget, or Inflammation of the Udder_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Inflammation of the Udder commonly occurs in heavy milkers, and\r\nis caused by all the milk not being removed. Sometimes it occurs as the\r\nresult of the milk accumulating in the udder when the bitch has lost\r\npart of her litter. Other causes are obstructed teats, injuries to the\r\nglandular tissues, and infection from germs. Congestion and inflammation\r\nof the udder frequently follow difficult birth.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Milk the bitch three or four times a day. This will usually\r\nrelieve the congestion. A physic of Castor Oil, one or two ounces,\r\nshould be given and the animal fed on easily digested food, as boiled\r\nvegetables, fresh raw beef finely chopped, pure sweet milk, etc. The\r\nudder should be massaged gently with the fingers, and the following\r\nointment applied: Gum Camphor, one dram; Fluid Extracts of Belladonna,\r\none dram; Lanolin, three ounces. Mix and apply two or three times daily.\r\nFomentations of hot water are beneficial in the majority of cases. If\r\nthe appetite is deprived, administer Nitrate of Potash, two drams;\r\nPulv. Nux Vomica, one dram; Pulv. Gentian Root, one dram. Mix and make\r\ninto twenty-four capsules and give one capsule three times daily before\r\nfeeding. This dose is based on a dog weighing forty pounds. Smaller or\r\nlarger dogs should receive the same medicine, but in doses proportionate\r\nto their weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—This skin eruption is produced by the Sarcoptes Scabi. There are\r\ntwo other forms of parasites that produce Mange, but they are so rarely\r\nfound that we need not mention them. Insanitary conditions favor their\r\nproduction. A dog in a poor condition, with a dirty skin, etc., is\r\nmore liable to be attacked than dogs in good condition and with clean\r\nskins. It may be communicated in various ways, through kennels, brushes,\r\ncollars, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Are generally very plain. It usually attacks the back, about\r\nthe root of the tail, and extends to the head and neck, spreading\r\nquickly. The scabs do not pile up as they do on other large animals,\r\nbecause the dogs, on account of the intense itching, continually rub\r\nand scratch themselves so that only thin scabs can form. The affected\r\nskin becomes denude of hair, the dog becomes thin, emaciated, etc. The\r\nparasites can be seen with an ordinary magnifying glass, or if the small\r\nscabs be scraped off and placed on a dark paper in the warm sun, you can\r\nreadily see small, white objects moving about. Eczema usually attacks the\r\nbelly, etc., while true Sarcoptic Mange attacks the back and then spreads.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Feed soft, laxative food and give one to two ounces of\r\nCastor Oil; also provide clean, dry sleeping quarters. I have found the\r\nfollowing remedy very successful in the treatment of Mange: Oil of Tar,\r\none-half ounce; Vinice Turpentine, two ounces; Sublime Sulphur, one\r\npound; Crude Petrolatum, one quart. Apply once a day. A few applications\r\nare generally sufficient to effect a cure. Great care should be\r\nexercised, as this disease is very contagious, and communicated to other\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—The common cause, perhaps, is a sudden chilling of the body; cold,\r\ndamp, chilly weather and damp, drafty kennels are favorable conditions\r\nto cause chilling of the body and the rheumatic form of Pleurisy. Germs\r\nmay also produce it. It is commonly met with in specific diseases, as\r\nDistemper, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Chilling and high temperature, two to four degrees above\r\nnormal, the dog generally refuses to eat, and acts dull. Pain is a\r\nnoticeable sign, and when the sides of the chest are pressed with the\r\nhand the dog will flinch; this is very noticeable during the early stage\r\nof the inflammation, and may cause a dog to act restless. When breathing\r\nthe ribs are always held rigid. The breathing movements are mostly in\r\nthe muscles of the flanks, the dog getting his breath in short jerks.\r\nLater, when fluids collect in the chest cavity, the breathing is more\r\nlabored, and all of the abdominal muscles are used. On absorption of this\r\nfluid, the movements of the lungs may again become jerky in case the\r\ninflammation becomes chronic. The character of the pulse beats varies,\r\nand in some cases is very weak. In the early stage of the disease,\r\nfriction sounds, caused by the dry inflamed membranes rubbing against\r\neach other, are detected on placing the ear against the chest walls.\r\nLater, the collection of fluids around the lungs may deaden all lung\r\nsounds, especially towards the lower part of the chest. In a mild case\r\nof Pleurisy, the inflammation is localized to just part of the lungs, or\r\npleura. A lameness in both front limbs and stiffness in moving about are\r\nthe most noticeable signs in this form of disease. In Chronic Pleurisy\r\na dog is usually very weak and depressed. He is seen frequently lying\r\non his side, and shows great difficulty in walking. The course of Acute\r\nPleurisy is from six to eighteen days; the chronic form may run a course\r\nof two or three months, or longer. This form is unsatisfactorily treated,\r\nand the dog eventually dies.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Place the dog in clean, warm, comfortable surroundings; fresh\r\nair is very beneficial, but omit any drafts. Internally, administer the\r\nfollowing: Quinine Sulphate, two drams; Potassium Iodide, two drams;\r\nCarbonate of Ammonia, one dram; Potassium Nitrate, four drams. Mix and\r\nmake into thirty-two capsules. Give one capsule every three or four\r\nhours. This dose is based on a dog weighing forty pounds; to smaller\r\nor larger dogs give the same medicine, but in doses proportionate to\r\ntheir weight. Feed the dog raw eggs, pure fresh milk, cooked vegetables,\r\nfinely chopped beef or beef broth, and in some cases I believe it is very\r\nbeneficial to give the dog small doses of brandy. Over the lungs apply\r\nthe following liniment: Aqua Ammonia Fort., one ounce; Oil of Turpentine,\r\none ounce; Sweet Oil, two ounces. Shake well and apply like a shampoo\r\nonce daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPILES\r\n\r\n(_Prolapse of the Rectum_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Overfeeding with too stimulating food, deficiency in exercise,\r\nconstipation, causing straining; consequently, Piles frequently follows.\r\nThis condition sometimes occurs in weak, debilitated dogs, due to a\r\nrelaxed condition of the intestines.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—In some cases only a portion of the rectal mucous membrane\r\nprotrudes outside of the anus. In the more severe cases red, bleeding\r\ntumors will be present. After being exposed for a time, it becomes\r\nenormously swollen and dark in color, and finally dries and cracks on\r\nits surface. The protruded part itches intensely, and the dog rubs and\r\ninjures the intestine trying to relieve the irritation. Usually the\r\nappetite falls off, and the dog is restless if not relieved.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—When the dog is constipated, as is usually the case it should\r\nbe given a laxative, such as one to three ounces of Castor Oil, and fed\r\non food that is loosening to the bowels. The protruded rectal mucous\r\nmembrane should be washed with warm water containing five per cent\r\nCarbolic Acid until clean; then replace. If badly swollen and inflamed,\r\nastringent wash should be used, made from Water and Powdered Alum five\r\nper cent. The protrusion can be returned by gentle pressure of the\r\nfingers. In case the protruded rectum shows signs of sloughing, it should\r\nbe cut off and the cut edges of the rectum stitched to the edges of the\r\nanus.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABIES\r\n\r\n(_Mad Dog_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Rabies is produced by a specific micro-organism that is known\r\nto exist in the brain, spinal cord and the saliva of affected animals.\r\nThis disease is communicated from one animal to another by inoculation,\r\nusually by the bite of a rabied dog, or the saliva entering a wound or\r\nabrasion. Wild animals, as well as domesticated, no doubt spread the\r\ndisease by biting, but it is a fact that dogs are inclined to bite, and\r\nhave a good opportunity to attack people, and hence are considered the\r\nprincipal factor in the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Are characterized by two forms of Rabies: Furious and Dumb. In\r\nFurious Rabies, the general habits of the dogs are changed. They become\r\nvery restless, excited, and frequently are more affectionate than usual,\r\nlicking the hands or face, soliciting sympathy and help. This form of\r\nRabies is extremely dangerous, for the dog’s tongue is covered with\r\nsaliva containing micro-organisms which, coming in contact with thin\r\nskin, wounds or abrasions, may inoculate the person to whom the dog is\r\nattempting to prove its fondness, etc. This form of inoculation is not\r\nuncommon. Usually, the dog becomes dull, melancholy, etc., seeking some\r\ncool, dark and quiet place. The eyes at times are fixed, or are rolled\r\nabout, and there is an abundant secretion of saliva, which dribbles from\r\nthe mouth. It frequently gnaws wood, especially if tied or locked up,\r\nand makes a desperate effort to get away. It also swallows indigestible\r\nobjects, and attempts to bite its master, mistress and animals. Paralysis\r\nsoon develops, and the dog has difficulty in swallowing, and is unable to\r\nmove about.\r\n\r\nDUMB RABIES.—This form of Rabies is accompanied by depression and a\r\ntendency to lick objects. Paralysis of the muscles that close the mouth\r\ncauses the jaw to drop or hang down. The dog is unable to bite and, owing\r\nto the relaxed conditions of the mouth, he cannot close it. The tongue\r\nhangs out, and stringy saliva escapes. The dog may attempt to bite even\r\nthough the muscles that close the mouth are paralyzed. The duration of\r\nthe disease is short; paralysis develops early in the attack, and death\r\nusually occurs in from two to four days.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Prevention. All vagrant dogs should be exterminated, and all\r\ndogs that appear in public highways, streets or public places should\r\nbe muzzled. This precaution has practically eradicated the disease in\r\nEurope. Medical treatment is useless after the first appearance of the\r\nsymptoms. However, a wound infected by Rabies should be immediately\r\ncauterized, or even completely cut away, care being taken to cut entirely\r\naround the wound in the healthy flesh. For cauterizing the wound, use\r\nNitric Acid or a hot iron. Sometimes a ten per cent solution of Zinc\r\nChloride is used, and perhaps it is the most successful. To afford\r\nabsolute protection, this should be done within a few minutes after being\r\nbitten. However, treatment even as late as a few hours has been known\r\nto suppress the development of the disease. Pasteur has originated a\r\nvirus which is used with great success, and any person bitten by a dog\r\nsuspected of Rabies should be submitted to Pasteur’s treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM\r\n\r\n(_Articular and Muscular_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—This disease is generally attributed to cold, damp, filthy,\r\nill-ventilated kennels, and exposure, but it may occur in dogs that\r\nare well cared for. Overfeeding is also liable to produce it. The most\r\nfrequent forms of Rheumatism in dogs are Lumbago, Chest Founder, or\r\nKennel Lameness.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The symptoms are quite marked. These are severe loss of\r\nappetite, lameness and general lack of condition. Sometimes large\r\nswellings appear in the region of the hock, knee, and joints of the feet.\r\nThe muscles of the back are held stiff and arched, the muscles are tender\r\nand sensitive when pressed, and the dog may be unable to move his hind\r\nparts. Other cases may show a serious train of symptoms. A bitch that has\r\nraised a litter of pups, when in poor flesh, is often affected with this\r\ndisease. A lameness of one or more of the limbs that shows a tendency to\r\nshift about is the only sign noticed in the mild form of the disease.\r\nStiffness of the joints is noticed, especially if the quarters are\r\naffected, and the dog lies around a good share of the time and refuses\r\nto go far for its food. In Acute Rheumatism, the pain in the affected\r\nmuscles and joints is intense, and when these parts are handled, or the\r\njoints moved, the dog will whine from the pain produced. When lying down,\r\nasleep, sudden contractions of the muscles may be noticed. This is due\r\nto the pain resulting from the relaxing of the muscles. This disease\r\nmay pursue a long course; the joints become greatly enlarged, and the\r\ndog grows very thin and weak. In such cases, a complete recovery seldom\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Prevention is very important, such as providing dry,\r\ncomfortable quarters, and the avoidance of exposure. Unless this is\r\npracticed, but little can be obtained from medical treatment. A soft\r\nlaxative diet is also indicated: Salicylate Soda, three drams; Quinine\r\nSulphate, one dram. Make into twenty capsules and give one capsule every\r\nthree or four hours. When the bowels are constipated, give two or three\r\nounces of Castor Oil. The above doses are based on a dog weighing forty\r\npounds. Smaller or larger dogs should receive the same medicine but\r\nproportionately to their weight. It is advisable, in cases where the\r\nlimbs are badly swollen, to apply liniments, and I would recommend the\r\nfollowing: Aqua Ammonia Fort., two ounces; Oil of Turpentine, two ounces;\r\nSweet Oil, four ounces. Shake and rub on the affected parts once or\r\ntwice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICKETS\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Perhaps the most common cause of this disease is a faulty diet, as\r\nfood that is deficient in inorganic matter. Unless supplemented by milk\r\nor other foods containing lime salt, the bones are not supplied with the\r\nnecessary elements; lack of exercise, ill-ventilated, filthy kennels,\r\netc., help in causing the disease. A tendency towards Rickets in pups is\r\nno doubt hereditary.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The dog is usually in good condition at the beginning of\r\nthe disease. Large, well grown pups may suddenly develop symptoms of\r\nparalysis of the hind parts. The weakened condition of the thigh bone,\r\nnot being able to support the dog’s weight, fractures. At other times\r\nthere is a weakness and bending of bones in the limbs, breaking down of\r\nthe feet, bending or arching of the back, straddling gait, deformed or\r\ndisfigured condition of the face or nose.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Rickets can be prevented by careful feeding on suitable foods\r\nand keeping the dog clean in well ventilated kennels, where he can get\r\nplenty of exercise. Whenever a litter of several pups show symptoms of\r\nthe disease, the character of the food should be looked into, and if\r\nfaulty corrected by adding to it medicines or food containing required\r\nelements. It is hardly practical to use medical treatment other than\r\nbitter tonics. Unless the disease is in an advanced stage, it can\r\nusually be controlled by careful feeding of a ration rich in inorganic\r\nsubstances, as bone dust, lime water, and crushed egg shells, with a view\r\nof supplying calcareous matter to the system. This can be fed to the\r\nbitch nursing the pups or, if the pups are weaned, feed them carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGWORM\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Dogs may become infected with Ringworm by coming in contact with\r\ninfected dogs, or by being shipped in crates or boxes in which infected\r\ndogs have recently been transported, or by using blankets, brushes,\r\ncollars, etc., which have been recently used by infected dogs.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Small red spots first appear on the skin, gradually enlarging,\r\nand are covered with a thin, grayish scale, under which is found a serum.\r\nThe hair falls out as a result of the infection of the skin by the\r\nparasite. The outside of the affected patches is red, while the inner\r\nportion takes on a grayish-white color, giving it a ring appearance.\r\nThis condition is followed by severe itching; the dog rubs and scratches\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—The most effective drug is Tincture of Iodine, applied once\r\ndaily with a brush. Great care must be exercised, as this disease may be\r\ntransmitted to man, and to all domestic animals. Sanitary surroundings\r\nand good, clean food, that is easily digested, assists materially in\r\neradicating the parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUNDWORMS\r\n\r\n(_Maw Worms_)\r\n\r\nThis worm is commonly seen infesting the intestines of puppies. The body\r\nis generally white in color and slightly curved at the head. This worm\r\nhas a stiff, wiry appearance, and measures from one to three and one-half\r\ninches in length.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Puppies are more susceptible to these worms, although we find\r\nthem in aged dogs. About fifty per cent of the dogs are infested with\r\nthese worms. They cause irritation of the intestines, irregularity of\r\ndigestion, diarrhoea, colic, nervousness, constipation, irregular\r\nappetite and a rough, dry, unthrifty appearance of the hair and skin, and\r\nthe dog becomes emaciated. After this worm migrates into the stomach, it\r\ncauses nausea and vomiting, occasionally the bowels are filled with large\r\nmasses of these worms, and their passage aids in determining the cause of\r\nthe dog’s debility.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Withhold all food from eighteen to twenty-four hours\r\nand administer Thymol, one grain; Santonin, three grains; Calomel,\r\ntwo grains. Mix and place in capsule and give in one dose to a dog\r\nweighing fifty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs should receive the same\r\nprescription, but in doses proportionate to their weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE THROAT\r\n\r\n(_Pharyngitis—Laryngitis_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—Sore Throat is frequently complicated by a cold. Sometimes it\r\nis produced by inhaling irritating gases, or administering irritating\r\nmedicine. Injuries from sharp pointed sticks, eating sharp bones, etc.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—It is more or less severe. The eyes are red and watery, and\r\nthe dog is dull and lies around most of the time. The appetite is poor\r\nand, because of the pain and difficulty in swallowing, the dog may refuse\r\nfood. The pain in the throat is sometimes severe, and causes the dog to\r\nmove about in a restless manner. The character of the cough depends on\r\nthe part inflamed. When the larynx (opening of the windpipe) is involved,\r\nthe cough is usually hoarse and the breathing noisy and labored, as the\r\nopening is more or less closed by the inflammation. At other times it is\r\ndry and, when the dog moves about, or the parts are irritated by dust,\r\ncold air, etc., coughing spells usually follow. The throat may be swollen\r\nso as to be noticeable from the outside. Simple Sore Throat is not a\r\nserious affection, and lasts but a short time. The symptoms may be so\r\nmild as to escape observation; however, if the conditions are favorable,\r\nit may re-occur and assume a severe form or become chronic.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Place the dog in clean, warm, well ventilated quarters and\r\nfeed soft food that is easily digested, as hot milk, boiled rice, etc.,\r\nand administer the following: Potassium Chlorate, one dram; Liq. Ammonia\r\nAcet., three ounces; Vini Ipecac, two drams; Tincture Camph. Co.,\r\none-half ounce; Aqua Chloroform, quantity sufficient to make six ounces.\r\nGive one teaspoonful every four hours. This dose is based on a dog\r\nweighing forty pounds. To smaller or larger dogs give doses in proportion\r\nto their weight. When the throat becomes badly swollen, apply a liniment\r\nmade from equal parts of Aqua Ammonia Fort., Turpentine and Sweet Oil.\r\nApply over the throat and rub in briskly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAPEWORM\r\n\r\n(_Tenia Marginata_)\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—A dog eating raw flesh of sheep or cattle infested with the larva\r\nof the Tapeworm or Gid, Sturdy, or Water Balls. (See Gid in Sheep.)\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—Tapeworms in dogs are numerous. It must be borne in mind that\r\nan animal is not free from them until the Tapeworm’s head, apparently\r\nthe most insignificant part, has passed from the intestines. So long as\r\nthe head remains attached to the wall of the bowels by its hooklets it\r\nwill develop fresh eggs, producing segments which are passed and prove\r\nthe means of scattering the parasites. A dog infected with Tapeworm, as\r\na rule, is liable to reflex paralysis, coughing and convulsions from\r\nthe irritation caused by its presence in the bowels, depraved appetite,\r\nunthriftiness, a rough, unhealthy condition of the skin, loss of hair,\r\nanemia, irregularity of the bowels, and the feces offensive and slimy.\r\nThere is generally a certain amount of irritation of the anus, which\r\nrenders the dog fond of licking those parts or dragging them along on\r\nthe ground. Tapeworms frequently cause vomiting, and I have seen portions\r\nof Tapeworms expelled in this way. In other cases there may be diarrhoea\r\nand obstinate indigestion may be traced to the presence of Tapeworms.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Withhold all food for twenty-four hours and administer\r\nExtract of Mail Fern, two drams; Pulv. Areca Nut, one dram. Mix in two\r\ntablespoonfuls of syrup and give at one dose. Follow this treatment in\r\nabout two hours with one to two ounces of Castor Oil. This treatment\r\nshould be repeated in a week or ten days. These doses are based on a dog\r\nweighing forty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs should receive the same\r\nmedicine, but in doses proportionate to their weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOMITION\r\n\r\nCAUSE.—This is a symptom which shows itself in almost any disease to\r\nwhich the dog is subject, so extensive are the reflex influences which\r\nfollow disease in a dog. This process of Vomiting can be brought about\r\nin the dog by means of many medicines, and the good effect of emetics is\r\nappreciable even to the most casual observer. This class of medicines has\r\nbeen much abused by those caring for sick dogs, emetics being given for\r\nany and every disease. They sometimes free the stomach of irritants and\r\npoisons which cause disease and poisoning, but their use requires care\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.—The dog shows very marked symptoms of pain, but usually the\r\nfirst signs exhibited are those of a sense of discomfort. The dog moans\r\nin his sleep, wakes suddenly, curls himself up and goes to sleep again.\r\nThis continues until at last the vomiting is too urgent to allow rest.\r\nThe dog utters sharp, shrill, continuous cries, tries all sorts of\r\npositions to get itself at ease, and walks about with the back arched.\r\nThere may be distention of the abdomen, due to the gases generated in\r\nthe bowels from the fermentation of their contents. Colicky symptoms\r\nfrequently accompany vomiting, due to the spasmodic contractions of the\r\nstomach relieving itself of some irritant.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—Knowing that the causes operating in the production of\r\nVomiting are so numerous, it will be easily understood that the treatment\r\nmust be equally variable. If due to the torpidity of the liver, give\r\nCalomel, one to two grains. When worms are suspected, give worm treatment\r\nrecommended under the heading of Worms. When due to poisoning, give\r\nmilk and raw eggs. In case it is due to faulty digestion, or where a\r\ndog is recovering from some debilitating disease, give one-fourth to\r\none-half teaspoonful of Baking Soda in a gelatin capsule two or three\r\ntimes a day. The following prescription is recommended when all suspected\r\nirritants are removed from the stomach: Diluted Prussic Acid (B. P.),\r\ntwelve drops; Bismuth Nitrate, one dram; Lime Water, four ounces. Mix and\r\ngive one tablespoonful three times daily. This dose is based on a dog\r\nweighing fifty pounds. Smaller or larger dogs should receive the same\r\nprescription, but in doses proportionate to their weight. This medicine\r\nshould be administered with great precaution, as it is very poisonous\r\nwhen used in larger doses, or given at shorter intervals than above\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS\r\n\r\nA wound is a disruption of the soft parts of the body due to external\r\nviolence. Wounds are of various kinds, as incised, lacerated, punctured,\r\ngunshot and poisonous.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.—If a wound is extensive, and bleeding is present, first arrest\r\nit, and the most satisfactory method is as follows: Tie the artery from\r\nwhich the blood is escaping, or twist with forceps, cauterize with hot\r\niron, compress by bandaging tightly and apply Tincture of Chloride of\r\nIron. This coagulates the blood, and is very effective. One important\r\nfactor in treating wounds is to attend to the drainage, as decomposed\r\nmatter absorbed into the blood produces blood poisoning. Dogs lick wounds\r\nand keep them clean, therefore it is hardly necessary to apply medicine.\r\n\r\nSEWING WOUNDS.—I cannot recommend sewing except in cases of incised or\r\nclean-cut wounds. After clipping the hair from around the incision,\r\nand washing it thoroughly with a one in one-thousandth solution of\r\nBichloride, stitch with cat-gut or absorbent silk suture. In case of\r\ndeep, punctured or gunshot wounds, with a syringe wash out the wounds,\r\nusing a one in one-thousandth Bichloride solution. For open wounds, use\r\ndusting powders, as Iodoform, Boracic Acid, etc.\r\n\r\nTo keep flies from annoying a wounded dog, apply the following\r\nprescription: Oil of Origanum, one ounce; Oil of Turpentine, one ounce;\r\nSweet Oil, one ounce. Apply to and around the wound with a feather. This\r\nis also a good healing liniment as well as a fly repellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nSwine\r\n\r\n    Abortion, 7\r\n\r\n    Administration of Medicine to Hogs, 7\r\n\r\n    Anus,
