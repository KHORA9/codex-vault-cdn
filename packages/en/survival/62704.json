(1.)—THE POWER OF NATURE AS MANIFESTED IN ANTIPATHIES. THE\r\nECHENEÏS: TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the proper order of things, we have now arrived at the\r\nculminating point of the wonders manifested to us by the operations of\r\nNature. And even at the very outset, we find spontaneously presented\r\nto us an incomparable illustration of her mysterious powers: so\r\nmuch so, in fact, that beyond it we feel ourselves bound to forbear\r\nextending our enquiries, there being nothing to be found either equal\r\nor analogous to an element in which Nature quite triumphs over herself,\r\nand that, too, in such numberless ways. For what is there more unruly\r\nthan the sea, with its winds, its tornadoes, and its tempests? And yet\r\nin what department of her works has Nature been more seconded by the\r\ningenuity of man, than in this, by his inventions of sails and of oars?\r\nIn addition to this, we are struck with the ineffable might displayed\r\nby the Ocean’s tides, as they constantly ebb and flow, and so regulate\r\nthe currents of the sea as though they were the waters of one vast\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all these forces, though acting in unison, and impelling in the\r\nsame direction, a single fish, and that of a very diminutive size—the\r\nfish known as the “echeneïs”[2]—possesses the power of counteracting.\r\nWinds may blow and storms may rage, and yet the echeneïs controls their\r\nfury, restrains their mighty force, and bids ships stand still in their\r\ncareer; a result which no cables, no anchors, from their ponderousness\r\nquite incapable of being weighed, could ever have produced! A fish\r\nbridles the impetuous violence of the deep, and subdues the frantic\r\nrage of the universe—and all this by no effort of its own, no act of\r\nresistance on its part, no act at all, in fact, but that of adhering\r\nto the bark! Trifling as this object would appear, it suffices to\r\ncounteract all these forces combined, and to forbid the ship to pass\r\nonward in its way! Fleets, armed for war, pile up towers and bulwarks\r\non their decks, in order that, upon the deep even, men may fight from\r\nbehind ramparts as it were. But alas for human vanity!—when their\r\nprows, beaked as they are with brass and with iron,[3] and armed for\r\nthe onset, can thus be arrested and rivetted to the spot by a little\r\nfish, no more than some half foot in length!\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Actium, it is said, a fish of this kind stopped the\r\nprætorian ship[4] of Antonius in its course, at the moment that he was\r\nhastening from ship to ship to encourage and exhort his men, and so\r\ncompelled him to leave it and go on board another. Hence it was, that\r\nthe fleet of Cæsar gained the advantage[5] in the onset, and charged\r\nwith a redoubled impetuosity. In our own time, too, one of these fish\r\narrested the ship of the Emperor[6] Caius in its course, when he was\r\nreturning from Astura to Antium:[7] and thus, as the result proved,\r\ndid an insignificant fish give presage of great events; for no sooner\r\nhad the emperor returned to Rome than he was pierced by the weapons\r\nof his own soldiers. Nor did this sudden stoppage of the ship long\r\nremain a mystery, the cause being perceived upon finding that, out of\r\nthe whole fleet, the emperor’s five-banked galley was the only one\r\nthat was making no way. The moment this was discovered, some of the\r\nsailors plunged into the sea, and, on making search about the ship’s\r\nsides, they found an echeneïs adhering to the rudder. Upon its being\r\nshown to the emperor, he strongly expressed his indignation that such\r\nan obstacle as this should have impeded his progress, and have rendered\r\npowerless the hearty endeavours of some four hundred men. One thing,\r\ntoo, it is well known, more particularly surprised[8] him, how it was\r\npossible that the fish, while adhering to the ship, should arrest its\r\nprogress, and yet should have no such power when brought on board.\r\n\r\nAccording to the persons who examined it on that occasion, and who\r\nhave seen it since, the echeneïs bears a strong resemblance to a\r\nlarge slug.[9] The various opinions entertained respecting it we\r\nhave already[10] noticed, when speaking of it in the Natural History\r\nof Fishes. There is no doubt, too, that all fish of this kind are\r\npossessed of a similar power; witness, for example, the well-known\r\ninstance of the shells[11] which are still preserved and consecrated\r\nin the Temple of Venus at Cnidos, and which, we are bound to believe,\r\nonce gave such striking evidence of the possession of similar\r\nproperties. Some of our own authors have given this fish the Latin\r\nname of “mora.”[12] It is a singular thing, but among the Greeks we\r\nfind writers who state that, worn as an amulet, the echeneïs has the\r\nproperty,[13] as already mentioned, of preventing miscarriage, and of\r\nreducing procidence of the uterus, and so permitting the fœtus to reach\r\nmaturity: while others, again, assert that, if it is preserved in salt\r\nand worn as an amulet, it will facilitate parturition; a fact to which\r\nit is indebted for another name which it bears, “odinolytes.”[14] Be\r\nall this as it may, considering this most remarkable fact of a ship\r\nbeing thus stopped in its course, who can entertain a doubt as to the\r\npossibility of any manifestation of her power by Nature, or as to\r\nthe effectual operation of the remedies which she has centred in her\r\nspontaneous productions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—THE TORPEDO: NINE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, besides, even if we had not this illustration by the agency\r\nof the echeneïs, would it not have been quite sufficient only to cite\r\nthe instance of the torpedo,[15] another inhabitant also of the sea,\r\nas a manifestation of the mighty powers of Nature? From a considerable\r\ndistance even, and if only touched with the end of a spear or staff,\r\nthis fish has the property of benumbing even the most vigorous arm, and\r\nof rivetting the feet of the runner, however swift he may be in the\r\nrace. If, upon considering this fresh illustration, we find ourselves\r\ncompelled to admit that there is in existence a certain power which,\r\nby the very exhalations[16] and, as it were, emanations therefrom, is\r\nenabled to affect the members of the human body,[17] what are we not to\r\nhope for from the remedial influences which Nature has centred in all\r\nanimated beings?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—THE SEA HARE: FIVE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo less wonderful, too, are the particulars which we find stated\r\nrelative to the sea-hare.[18] Taken with the food or drink, it is a\r\npoison to some persons; while to others, again, the very sight of it\r\nis venomous.[19] Indeed, if a woman in a  state of pregnancy so much\r\nas looks upon one of these fishes, she is immediately seized with\r\nnausea and vomiting—a proof that the injury has reached the stomach—and\r\nabortion is the ultimate result. The proper preservative against these\r\nbaneful effects is the male fish, which is kept dried for the purpose\r\nin salt, and worn in a bracelet upon the arm. And yet this same fish,\r\nwhile in the sea, is not injurious, by its contact even. The only\r\nanimal that eats it without fatal consequences, is the mullet;[20] the\r\nsole perceptible result being that its flesh is rendered more tender\r\nthereby, but deteriorated in flavour, and consequently not so highly\r\nesteemed.\r\n\r\nPersons when poisoned[21] by the sea-hare smell strongly of the\r\nfish—the first sign, indeed, by which the fact of their having been so\r\npoisoned is detected. Death also ensues at the end of as many days as\r\nthe fish has lived: hence it is that, as Licinius Macer informs us,\r\nthis is one of those poisons which have no definite time for their\r\noperation. In India,[22] we are assured, the sea-hare is never taken\r\nalive; and, we are told that, in those parts of the world, man, in his\r\nturn, acts as a poison upon the fish, which dies instantly in the sea,\r\nif it is only touched with the human finger. There, like the rest of\r\nthe animals, it attains a much larger size than it does with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—MARVELS OF THE RED SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuba, in those books descriptive of Arabia, which he has dedicated to\r\nCaius Cæsar, the son of Augustus, informs us that there are mussels[23]\r\non those coasts, the shells of which are capable of holding three\r\nsemisextarii; and that, on one occasion, a whale,[24] six hundred feet\r\nin length and three hundred and sixty feet broad,[25] made its way up a\r\nriver of Arabia, the blubber of which was bought up by the merchants\r\nthere. He tells us, too, that in those parts they anoint their camels\r\nwith the grease of all kinds of fish, for the purpose of keeping off\r\nthe gad-flies[26] by the smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (2.)—THE INSTINCTS OF FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statements which Ovid has made as to the instincts of fish, in the\r\nwork[27] of his known as the “Halieuticon,”[28] appear to me truly\r\nmarvellous. The scarus,[29] for instance, when enclosed in the wicker\r\nkype, makes no effort to escape with its head, nor does it attempt to\r\nthrust its muzzle between the oziers; but turning its tail towards\r\nthem, it enlarges the orifices with repeated blows therefrom, and so\r\nmakes its escape backwards. Should,[30] too, another scarus, from\r\nwithout, chance to see it thus struggling within the kype, it will take\r\nthe tail of the other in its mouth, and so aid it in its efforts to\r\nescape. The lupus,[31] again, when surrounded with the net, furrows[32]\r\nthe sand with its tail, and so conceals itself, until the net has\r\npassed over it. The muræna,[33] trusting in the slippery smoothness[34]\r\nof its rounded back, boldly faces the meshes of the net, and by\r\nrepeatedly wriggling its body, makes its escape. The polyp[35] makes\r\nfor the hooks, and, without swallowing the bait, clasps it with its\r\nfeelers; nor does it quit its hold until it has eaten off the bait, or\r\nperceives itself being drawn out of the water by the rod.\r\n\r\nThe mullet,[36] too, is aware[37] that within the bait there is a hook\r\nconcealed, and is on its guard against the ambush; still however,\r\nso great is its voracity, that it beats the hook with its tail, and\r\nstrikes away from it the bait. The lupus,[38] again, shows less\r\nforesight and address, but repentance at its imprudence arms it with\r\nmighty strength; for, when caught by the hook, it flounders from side\r\nto side, and so widens the wound, till at last the insidious hook falls\r\nfrom its mouth. The muræna[39] not only swallows the hook, but catches\r\nat the line with its teeth, and so gnaws it asunder. The anthias,[40]\r\nOvid says, the moment it finds itself caught by the hook, turns its\r\nbody with its back downwards, upon which there is a sharp knife-like\r\nfin, and so cuts the line asunder.\r\n\r\nAccording to Licinius Macer, the muræna is of the female sex only, and\r\nis impregnated by serpents, as already[41] mentioned; and hence it is\r\nthat the fishermen, to entice it from its retreat, and catch it, make\r\na hissing noise in imitation of the hissing of a serpent. He states,\r\nalso, that by frequently beating the water it is made to grow fat, that\r\na blow with a stout stick will not kill it, but that a touch with a\r\nstalk of fennel-giant[42] is instantly fatal. That in the case of this\r\nanimal, the life is centred in the tail, there can be no doubt, as\r\nalso that it dies immediately on that part of the body being struck;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, there is considerable difficulty in killing\r\nit with a blow upon the head. Persons who have come in contact with the\r\nrazor-fish[43] smell of iron.[44] The hardest of all fishes, beyond a\r\ndoubt, is that known as the “orbis:”[45] it is spherical, destitute[46]\r\nof scales, and all head.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—MARVELLOUS PROPERTIES BELONGING TO CERTAIN FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrebius Niger informs us that whenever the loligo[48] is seen darting\r\nabove the surface of the water, it portends a change of weather: that\r\nthe xiphias,[49] or, in other words, the swordfish, has a sharp-pointed\r\nmuzzle, with which it is able to pierce the sides of a ship and send\r\nit to the bottom: instances of which have been known near a place in\r\nMauritania, known as Cotte, not far from the river Lixus.[50] He says,\r\ntoo, that the loligo sometimes darts above the surface, in such vast\r\nnumbers, as to sink the ships upon which they fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—PLACES WHERE FISH EAT FROM THE HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt many of the country-seats belonging to the Emperor the fish\r\neat[51] from the hand: but the stories of this nature, told with such\r\nadmiration by the ancients, bear reference to lakes formed by Nature,\r\nand not to fish-preserves; that at Elorus, a fortified place in\r\nSicily, for instance, not far from Syracuse. In the fountain, too, of\r\nJupiter, at Labranda,[52] there are eels which eat from the hand, and\r\nwear ear-rings,[53] it is said. The same, too, at Chios, near the Old\r\nMen’s Temple[54] there; and at the Fountain of Chabura in Mesopotamia,\r\nalready mentioned.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—PLACES WHERE FISH RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN VOICE. ORACULAR\r\nRESPONSES GIVEN BY FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Myra, too, in Lycia, the fish in the Fountain of Apollo, known\r\nas Surium, appear and give oracular presages, when thrice summoned\r\nby the sound of a flute. If they seize the flesh thrown to them with\r\navidity, it is a good omen for the person who consults them; but if,\r\non the other hand, they flap at it with their tails, it is considered\r\nan evil presage. At Hierapolis[56] in Syria, the fish in the Lake of\r\nVenus there obey the voice of the officers of the temple: bedecked\r\nwith ornaments of gold, they come at their call, fawn upon them while\r\nthey are scratched, and open their mouths so wide as to admit of the\r\ninsertion of the hands.\r\n\r\nOff the Rock of Hercules, in the territory of Stabiæ[57] in Campania,\r\nthe melanuri[58] seize with avidity bread that is thrown to them in the\r\nsea, but they will never approach any bait in which there is a hook\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—PLACES WHERE BITTER FISH ARE FOUND, SALT, OR SWEET.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is it by any means the least surprising fact, that off the island\r\nof Pele,[59] the town of Clazomenæ,[60] the rock[61] [of Scylla]\r\nin Sicily, and in the vicinity of Leptis in Africa,[62] Eubœa,\r\nand Dyrrhachium,[63] the fish are bitter. In the neighbourhood of\r\nCephallenia, Ampelos, Paros, and the rocks of Delos, the fish are so\r\nsalt by nature that they might easily be taken to have been pickled in\r\nbrine. In the harbour, again, of the last-mentioned island, the fish\r\nare sweet: differences, all of them, resulting, no doubt, from the\r\ndiversity[64] of their food.\r\n\r\nApion says that the largest among the fishes is the sea-pig,[65] known\r\nto the Lacedæmonians as the “orthagoriscos;” he states also that it\r\ngrunts[66] like a hog when taken. These accidental varieties in the\r\nnatural flavour of fish—a thing that is still more surprising—may,\r\nin some cases, be owing to the nature of the locality; an apposite\r\nillustration of which is, the well-known fact that, at Beneventum[67]\r\nin Italy, salted provisions of all kinds require[68] to be salted over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—WHEN SEA-FISH WERE FIRST EATEN BY THE PEOPLE OF ROME. THE\r\nORDINANCE OF KING NUMA AS TO FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCassius Hemina informs us that sea-fish have been in use at Rome from\r\nthe time of its foundation. I will give his own words, however, upon\r\nthe subject:—“Numa ordained that fish without[69] scales should not\r\nbe served up at the Festivals of the Gods; a piece of frugality, the\r\nintention of which was, that the banquets, both public and private, as\r\nwell as the repasts laid before the couches[70] of the gods, might be\r\nprovided at a smaller expense than formerly: it being also his wish to\r\npreclude the risk that the caterers for the sacred banquets would spare\r\nno expense in buying provisions, and so forestall the market.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—CORAL: FORTY-THREE REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same degree that people in our part of the world set a value\r\nupon the pearls of India—a subject on which we have already spoken[71]\r\non the appropriate occasion at sufficient length—do the people of India\r\nprize coral: it being the prevailing taste in each nation respectively\r\nthat constitutes the value of things. Coral is produced in the Red Sea\r\nalso, but of a more swarthy hue than ours. It is to be found also in\r\nthe Persian Gulf, where it is known by the name of “iace.” But the\r\nmost highly-esteemed of all, is that produced in the vicinity of the\r\nislands called Stœchades,[72] in the Gallic Gulf, and near the Æolian\r\nIslands and the town of Drepana in the Sea of Sicily. Coral is to be\r\nfound growing, too, at Graviscæ, and off the coast of Neapolis in\r\nCampania: as also at Erythræ, where it is intensely red, but soft, and\r\nconsequently little valued.\r\n\r\nIts form is that of a shrub,[73] and its colour green: its berries are\r\nwhite and soft while under water, but the moment they are removed from\r\nit, they become hard and red, resembling the berries of cultivated\r\ncornel in size and appearance. They say that, while alive, if it is\r\nonly touched by a person, it will immediately become as hard as stone;\r\nand hence it is that the greatest pains are taken to prevent this, by\r\ntearing it up from the bottom with nets, or else cutting it short with\r\na sharp-edged instrument of iron: from which last circumstance it is\r\ngenerally supposed to have received its name of “curalium.”[74] The\r\nreddest coral and the most branchy is held in the highest esteem; but,\r\nat the same time, it must not be rough or hard like stone; nor yet, on\r\nthe other hand, should it be full of holes or hollow.\r\n\r\nThe berries of coral are no less esteemed by the men in India than are\r\nthe pearls of that country by the females among us: their soothsayers,\r\ntoo, and diviners look upon coral as an amulet endowed with sacred\r\nproperties,[75] and a sure preservative against all dangers: hence\r\nit is that they equally value it as an ornament and as an object of\r\ndevotion. Before it was known in what estimation coral was held by\r\nthe people of India, the Gauls were in the habit of adorning their\r\nswords, shields, and helmets with it; but at the present day, owing to\r\nthe value set upon it as an article of exportation, it has become so\r\nextremely rare, that it is seldom to be seen even in the regions that\r\nproduce it. Branches of coral, hung at the neck of infants,[76] are\r\nthought to act as a preservative against danger. Calcined, pulverized,\r\nand taken in water, coral gives relief to patients suffering from\r\ngriping pains in the bowels, affections of the bladder, and urinary\r\ncalculi. Similarly taken in wine, or, if there are symptoms of fever,\r\nin water, it acts as a soporific. It resists the action of fire a\r\nconsiderable time before it is calcined.\r\n\r\nThere is also a statement made that if this medicament is frequently\r\ntaken internally, the spleen will be gradually consumed. Powdered\r\ncoral, too, is on excellent remedy for patients who bring up or spit\r\nblood. Calcined coral is used as an ingredient in compositions for the\r\neyes, being productive of certain astringent and cooling effects: it\r\nmakes flesh, also, in the cavities left by ulcers, and effaces scars\r\nupon the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—THE ANTIPATHIES AND SYMPATHIES WHICH EXIST BETWEEN\r\nCERTAIN OBJECTS. THE HATREDS MANIFESTED BY CERTAIN AQUATIC ANIMALS.\r\nTHE PASTINACA: EIGHT REMEDIES. THE GALEOS: FIFTEEN REMEDIES. THE\r\nSUR-MULLET: FIFTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reference to that repugnance which exists between certain things,\r\nknown to the Greeks as “antipathia,” there is nothing more venomous[77]\r\nthan the pastinaca, a sea-fish which kills trees even with its sting,\r\nas already[78] stated. And yet, poisonous as it is, the galeos[79]\r\npursues it; a fish which, though it attacks other marine animals as\r\nwell, manifests an enmity to the pastinaca in particular, just as on\r\ndry land the weasel does to serpents; with such avidity does it go in\r\npursuit of what is poisonous even! Persons stung by the pustinaca find\r\na remedy in the flesh of the galeos, as also in that of the sur-mullet\r\nand the vegetable production known as laser.[80]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13. (3).—AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS. CASTOREUM: SIXTY-SIX REMEDIES AND\r\nOBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe might of Nature, too, is equally conspicuous in the animals\r\nwhich live upon dry land as well;[81] the beaver, for instance, more\r\ngenerally known as “castor,” and the testes[82] of which are called\r\nin medicine “castorea.” Sextius, a most careful enquirer into the\r\nnature and history of medicinal substances, assures us that it is not\r\nthe truth that this animal, when on the point of being taken, bites\r\noff its testes: he informs us, also, that these substances are small,\r\ntightly knit, and attached to the back-bone, and that it is impossible\r\nto remove them without taking the animal’s life. We learn from him that\r\nthere is a mode of adulterating them by substituting the kidneys of the\r\nbeaver, which are of considerable size, whereas the genuine testes are\r\nfound to be extremely diminutive: in addition to which, he says that\r\nthey must not be taken to be bladders, as they are two in number, a\r\nprovision not to be found in any animal. Within these pouches,[83] he\r\nsays, there is a liquid found, which is preserved by being put in salt;\r\nthe genuine castoreum being easily known from the false, by the fact\r\nof its being contained in two pouches, attached by a single ligament.\r\nThe genuine article, he says, is sometimes fraudulently sophisticated\r\nby the admixture of gum and blood, or else hammoniacum:[84] as the\r\npouches, in fact, ought to be of the same colour as this last, covered\r\nwith thin coats full of a liquid of the consistency of honey mixed with\r\nwax, possessed of a fetid smell, of a bitter, acrid taste, and friable\r\nto the touch.\r\n\r\nThe most efficacious castoreum is that which comes from Pontus and\r\nGalatia, the next best being the produce of Africa. When inhaled, it\r\nacts as a sternutatory. Mixed with oil of roses and peucedanum,[85]\r\nand applied to the head, it is productive of narcotic effects—a result\r\nwhich is equally produced by taking it in water; for which reason\r\nit is employed in the treatment of phrenitis. Used as a fumigation,\r\nit acts as an excitant upon patients suffering from lethargy: and\r\nsimilarly employed, or used in the form of a suppository, it dispels\r\nhysterical[86] suffocations. It acts also as an emmenagogue and as an\r\nexpellent of the afterbirth, being taken by the patient, in doses of\r\ntwo drachmæ, with pennyroyal,[87] in water. It is employed also for the\r\ncure of vertigo, opisthotony, fits of trembling, spasms, affections\r\nof the sinews, sciatica, stomachic complaints, and paralysis, the\r\npatient either being rubbed with it all over, or else taking it as an\r\nelectuary, bruised and incorporated with seed of vitex,[88] vinegar,\r\nand oil of roses, to the consistency of honey. In the last form,\r\ntoo, it is taken for the cure of epilepsy, and in a potion, for the\r\npurpose of dispelling flatulency and gripings in the bowels, and for\r\ncounteracting the effects of poison.\r\n\r\nWhen taken as a potion, the only difference is in the mode of mixing\r\nit, according to the poison that it is intended to neutralize; thus,\r\nfor example, when it is taken for the sting of the scorpion, wine is\r\nused as the medium; and when for injuries inflicted by spiders or by\r\nthe phalangium,[89] honied wine where it is intended to be brought\r\nup again, and rue where it is desirable that it should remain upon\r\nthe stomach. For injuries inflicted by the chalcis,[90] it is taken\r\nwith myrtle wine; for the sting of the cerastes[91] or prester[92]\r\nwith panax[93] or rue in wine; and for those of other serpents, with\r\nwine only. In all these cases two drachmæ of castoreum is the proper\r\ndose, to one of the other ingredients respectively. It is particularly\r\nuseful, also, in combination with vinegar, in cases where viscus[94]\r\nhas been taken internally, and, with milk or water, as a neutralizer of\r\naconite: as an antidote to white hellebore it is taken with hydromel\r\nand nitre.[95] It is curative, also, of tooth-ache, for which purpose\r\nit is beaten up with oil and injected into the ear, on the side\r\naffected. For the cure of ear-ache, the best plan is to mix it with\r\nmeconium.[96] Applied with Attic honey in the form of an ointment, it\r\nimproves the eyesight, and taken with vinegar it arrests hiccup.\r\n\r\nThe urine, too, of the beaver, is a neutralizer of poisons, and for\r\nthis reason is used as an ingredient in antidotes. The best way of\r\nkeeping it, some think, is in the bladder of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14. (4.)—THE TORTOISE: SIXTY-SIX REMEDIES AND OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tortoise,[97] too, is an animal that is equally amphibious with the\r\nbeaver, and possessed of medicinal properties as strongly developed;\r\nin addition to which, it claims an equal degree of notice for the\r\nhigh price which luxury sets upon its shell,[98] and the singularity\r\nof its conformation. Of tortoises, there are various kinds, land\r\ntortoises,[99] sea tortoises,[100] tortoises[101] which live in muddy\r\nwaters, and tortoises[101] which live in fresh; these last being\r\nknown to some Greek authors by the name of “emydes.” The flesh of\r\nthe land-tortoise is employed for fumigations more particularly, and\r\nwe find it asserted that it is highly salutary for repelling the\r\nmalpractices of magic, and for neutralizing poisons. These tortoises\r\nare found in the greatest numbers in Africa; where the head and feet\r\nbeing first cut off, it is said, they are given to persons by way of\r\nantidote. Eaten, too, in a broth made from them, they are thought to\r\ndisperse scrofula, diminish the volume of the spleen, and effect the\r\ncure of epilepsy. The blood of the land-tortoise improves the eyesight,\r\nand removes cataract: it is kept also, made up with meal into pills,\r\nwhich are given with wine when necessary, to neutralize the poison of\r\nall kinds of serpents, frogs, spiders, and similar venomous animals. It\r\nis found a useful plan, too, in cases of glaucoma, to anoint the eyes\r\nwith gall of tortoises, mixed with Attic honey, and, for the cure of\r\ninjuries inflicted by scorpions, to drop the gall into the wound.\r\n\r\nAshes of tortoiseshell, kneaded up with wine and oil, are used for the\r\ncure of chaps upon the feet, and of ulcerations. The shavings of the\r\nsurface of the shell, administered in drink, act as an antaphrodisiac:\r\na thing that is the more surprising, from the fact that a powder\r\nprepared from the whole of the shell has the reputation of being a\r\nstrong aphrodisiac. As to the urine of the land-tortoise, I do not\r\nthink that it can be obtained otherwise than by opening it and taking\r\nout the bladder; this being one of those substances to which the adepts\r\nin magic attribute such marvellous properties. For the sting of the\r\nasp, they say, it is wonderfully effectual; and even more so, if bugs\r\nare mixed with it. The eggs of the tortoise, hardened by keeping, are\r\napplied to scrofulous sores and ulcers arising from burns or cold: they\r\nare taken also for pains in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the sea-tortoise,[102] mixed with that of frogs, is an\r\nexcellent remedy for injuries caused by the salamander;[103] indeed\r\nthere is nothing that is a better neutralizer of the secretions of the\r\nsalamander than the sea-tortoise. The blood of this animal reproduces\r\nthe hair when lost through alopecy, and is curative of porrigo and all\r\nkinds of ulcerations of the head; the proper method of using it being\r\nto let it dry, and then gently wash it off. For the cure of ear-ache,\r\nthis blood is injected with woman’s milk, and for epilepsy it is eaten\r\nwith fine wheaten flour, three heminæ of the blood being mixed with one\r\nhemina of vinegar. It is prescribed also for the cure of asthma; but\r\nin this case in combination with one hemina of wine. Sometimes, too,\r\nit is taken by asthmatic patients, with barley-meal and vinegar, in\r\npieces about the size of a bean; one of these pieces being taken each\r\nmorning and evening at first, but after some days, two in the evening.\r\nIn cases of epilepsy, the mouth of the patient is opened and this blood\r\nintroduced. For spasmodic affections, when not of a violent nature, it\r\nis injected, in combination with castoreum, as a clyster. If a person\r\nrinses his teeth three times a year with blood of tortoises, he will be\r\nalways exempt from tooth-ache. This blood is also a cure for asthmatic\r\naffections, and for the malady called “orthopnœa,” being administered\r\nfor these purposes in polenta.\r\n\r\nThe gall of the tortoise improves the eye-sight, effaces scars, and\r\ncures affections of the tonsillary glands, quinsy, and all kinds of\r\ndiseases of the mouth, cancers of that part more particularly, as well\r\nas cancer of the testes. Applied to the nostrils it dispels epilepsy,\r\nand sets the patient on his feet: incorporated in vinegar with the\r\nslough of a snake, it is a sovereign remedy for purulent discharges\r\nfrom the ears. Some persons add ox-gall and the broth of boiled\r\ntortoise-flesh, with an equal proportion of snake’s slough; but in\r\nsuch case, care must be taken to boil the tortoise in wine. Applied\r\nwith honey, this gall is curative of all diseases of the eyes; and for\r\nthe cure of cataract, gall of the sea-tortoise is used, in combination\r\nwith blood of the river-tortoise and milk. The hair, too, of females,\r\nis dyed[104] with this gall. For the cure of injuries inflicted by the\r\nsalamander, it will be quite sufficient to drink the broth of boiled\r\ntortoise-flesh.\r\n\r\nThere is, again, a third[105] kind of tortoise, which inhabits mud\r\nand swampy localities: the shell on its back is flat and broad, like\r\nthat upon the breast, and the callipash is not arched and rounded, the\r\ncreature being altogether of a repulsive appearance. However, there\r\nare some remedial medicaments to be derived even from this animal.\r\nThus, for instance, three of them are thrown into a fire made with\r\nwood cuttings, and the moment their shells begin to separate they are\r\ntaken off: the flesh is then removed, and boiled with a little salt,\r\nin one congius of water. When the water has boiled down to one third,\r\nthe broth is used, being taken by persons apprehensive of paralysis\r\nor of diseases of the joints. The gall, too, is found very useful for\r\ncarrying off pituitous humours and corrupt blood: taken in cold water,\r\nit has an astringent effect upon the bowels.\r\n\r\nThere is a fourth kind of tortoise, which frequents rivers. When used\r\nfor its remedial properties, the shell of the animal is removed,\r\nand the fat separated from the flesh and beaten up with the plant\r\naizoüm,[106] in combination with unguent and lily seed: a preparation\r\nhighly effectual, it is said, for the cure of quartan fevers, the\r\npatient being rubbed with it all over, the head excepted, just before\r\nthe paroxysms come on, and then well wrapped up and made to drink hot\r\nwater. It is stated also, that to obtain as much fat as possible, the\r\ntortoise should be taken on the fifteenth day of the moon, the patient\r\nbeing anointed on the sixteenth. The blood of this tortoise, dropt, by\r\nway of embrocation, upon the region of the brain, allays head-ache;\r\nit is curative also of scrofulous sores. Some persons recommend that\r\nthe tortoise should be laid[107] upon its back and its head cut off\r\nwith a copper knife, the blood being received in a new earthen vessel;\r\nand they assure us that the blood of any kind of tortoise, when thus\r\nobtained, will be an excellent liniment for the cure of erysipelas,\r\nrunning ulcers upon the head, and warts. Upon the same authority, too,\r\nwe are assured that the dung of any kind of tortoise is good for the\r\nremoval of inflammatory tumours. Incredible also as the statement is,\r\nwe find it asserted by some, that ships[108] make way more slowly when\r\nthey have the right foot of a tortoise on board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE AQUATIC ANIMALS, CLASSIFIED\r\nACCORDING TO THE RESPECTIVE DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to classify the various remedies derived from the\r\naquatic animals, according to the several diseases; not that we are\r\nby any means unaware that an exposition of all the properties of each\r\nanimal at once, would be more to the reader’s taste, and more likely\r\nto excite his admiration; but because we consider it more conducive\r\nto the practical benefit of mankind to have the various recipes thus\r\ngrouped and classified; seeing that this thing may be good for one\r\npatient, that for another, and that some of these remedies may be more\r\neasily met with in one place and some in another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (5.)—REMEDIES FOR POISONS, AND FOR NOXIOUS SPELLS. THE\r\nDORADE: FOUR REMEDIES. THE SEA-STAR: SEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already[109] stated in what country the honey is venomous: the\r\nfish known as the dorade[110] is an antidote to its effects. Honey,\r\neven in a pure state, is sometimes productive of surfeit, and of\r\nfits of indigestion, remarkable for their severity; the best remedy\r\nin such case, according to Pelops, is to cut off the feet, head, and\r\ntail, of a tortoise, and boil and eat the body; in place, however, of\r\nthe tortoise, Apelles mentions the scincus, an animal which has been\r\ndescribed elsewhere.[111] We have already mentioned too, on several\r\noccasions,[112] how highly venomous is the menstruous fluid: the\r\nsurmullet, as already[113] stated, entirely neutralizes its effects.\r\nThis last fish, too, either applied topically or taken as food, acts\r\nas an antidote to the venom[114] of the pastinaca, the land and sea\r\nscorpion, the dragon,[115] and the phalangium.[116] The head of this\r\nfish, taken fresh and reduced to ashes, is an active neutralizer of all\r\npoisons, that of fungi more particularly.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted also, that if the fish called the sea-star[117] is\r\nsmeared with a fox’s blood, and then nailed to the upper lintel of the\r\ndoor, or to the door itself, with a copper nail, no noxious spells will\r\nbe able to obtain admittance, or, at all events, to be productive of\r\nany ill effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—REMEDIES FOR THE STINGS OF SERPENTS, FOR THE BITES OF DOGS,\r\nAND FOR INJURIES INFLICTED BY VENOMOUS ANIMALS. THE SEA-DRAGON: THREE\r\nREMEDIES. TWENTY-FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM SALTED FISH. THE SARDA: ONE\r\nREMEDY. ELEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CYBIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nStings inflicted by the sea-dragon[118] or by the sea-scorpion, are\r\ncured by an application[119] of the flesh of those animals to the\r\nwound; the bites, too, of spiders are healed by the same means. In\r\nfine, as an antidote to every kind of poison, whether taken internally\r\nor acting through the agency of a sting or bite, there is considered\r\nto be nothing in existence more effectual than a decoction of the\r\nsea-dragon and sea-scorpion.\r\n\r\nThere are also certain remedies of this nature derived from preserved\r\nfish. Persons, for instance, who have received injuries from serpents,\r\nor have been bitten by other venomous animals, are recommended to eat\r\nsalt fish, and to drink undiluted wine every now and then, so as,\r\nthrough its agency, to bring up the whole of the food again by vomit:\r\nthis method being particularly good in cases where injuries have been\r\nreceived from the lizard called “chalcis,”[120] the cerastes,[121] the\r\nreptile known as the “seps,”[122] the elops,[123] or the dipsas.[124]\r\nFor the sting of the scorpion, salted fish should be taken in larger\r\nquantities, but not brought up again, the patient submitting to any\r\namount of thirst it may create: salt fish, too, should be applied, by\r\nway of plaster, to the wound. For the bite of the crocodile there is\r\nno more efficient remedy known. For the sting of the serpent called\r\n“prester,” the sarda[125] is particularly good. Salt fish is employed\r\nalso as a topical application for the bite of the mad dog; and even in\r\ncases where the wound has not been cauterized with hot iron, this is\r\nfound to be sufficiently effectual as a remedy. For injuries, also,\r\ninflicted by the sea-dragon,[126] an application is made of salt fish\r\nsteeped in vinegar. Cybium,[127] too, is productive of similar effects.\r\nAs a cure for the venomous sting inflicted with its stickle by the\r\nsea-dragon, the fish itself is applied topically to the wound, or else\r\nits brain, extracted whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE SEA-FROG: SIX REMEDIES. THE RIVER-FROG: FIFTY-TWO\r\nREMEDIES. THE BRAMBLE-FROG: ONE REMEDY. THIRTY-TWO OBSERVATIONS ON\r\nTHESE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broth prepared from sea-frogs,[128] boiled in wine and vinegar,\r\nis taken internally as a neutralizer of poisons and of the venom\r\nof the bramble-frog,[129] as also for injuries inflicted by the\r\nsalamander.[130] For the cure of injuries caused by the sea-hare\r\nand the various serpents above mentioned, it is a good plan to eat\r\nthe flesh of river-frogs, or to drink the liquor in which they have\r\nbeen boiled: as a neutralizer, too, of the venom of the scorpion,\r\nriver-frogs are taken in wine. Democritus assures us that if the\r\ntongue is extracted from a live frog, with no other part of the body\r\nadhering to it, and is then applied—the frog being first replaced in\r\nthe water—to a woman while asleep, just at the spot where the heart is\r\nfelt to palpitate, she will be sure to give a truthful answer to any\r\nquestion that may be put to her.\r\n\r\nTo this the Magi[131] add some other particulars, which, if there is\r\nany truth in them, would lead us to believe that frogs ought to be\r\nconsidered much more useful to society than laws.[132] They say, for\r\ninstance, that if a man takes a frog and transfixes it with a reed,\r\nentering the body at the sexual parts and coming out at the mouth, and\r\nthen dips the reed in the menstrual discharge of his wife, she will\r\nbe sure to conceive an aversion for all paramours. That the flesh of\r\nfrogs, attached to the kype or hook, as the case may be, makes a most\r\nexcellent bait, for purples more particularly, is a well-known fact.\r\nFrogs, they say, have a double[133] liver; and of this liver, when\r\nexposed to the attacks of ants, the part that is most eaten away is\r\nthought to be an effectual antidote to every kind of poison.\r\n\r\nThere are some frogs, again, which live only among brakes and thickets,\r\nfor which reason they have received the name of “rubetæ,”[134]\r\nor “bramble-frogs,” as already[135] stated. The Greeks call them\r\n“phryni:” they are the largest in size of all the frogs, have two\r\nprotuberances[136] like horns, and are full[137] of poison. Authors\r\nquite vie with one another in relating marvellous stories about them;\r\nsuch, for instance, as that if they are brought into the midst of a\r\nconcourse of people, silence will instantly prevail; as also that by\r\nthrowing into boiling water a small bone that is found in their right\r\nside, the vessel will immediately cool, and the water refuse to boil\r\nagain until it has been removed. This bone, they say, may be found by\r\nexposing a dead bramble-frog to ants, and letting them eat away the\r\nflesh: after which the bones must be put into the vessel,[138] one by\r\none.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, again, in the left side of this reptile there\r\nis another bone, they say, which, thrown into water, has all the\r\nappearance of making it boil, and the name given to which is\r\n“apocynon.”[139] This bone, it is said, has the property of assuaging\r\nthe fury of dogs, and, if put into the drink, of conciliating love\r\nand ending discord and strife. Worn, too, as an amulet, it acts as an\r\naphrodisiac, we are told. The bone, on the contrary, which is taken\r\nfrom the right side, acts powerfully as a refrigerative upon boiling\r\nliquids, it is said: attached to the patient in a piece of fresh\r\nlamb’s-skin, it has the repute of assuaging quartan and other fevers,\r\nand of checking amorous propensities. The spleen of these frogs is used\r\nas an antidote to the various poisons that are prepared from them; and\r\nfor all these purposes the liver is considered still more efficacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE ENHYDRIS: SIX REMEDIES. THE RIVER-CRAB: FOURTEEN\r\nREMEDIES. THE SEA-CRAB: SEVEN REMEDIES. THE RIVER-SNAIL: SEVEN\r\nREMEDIES. THE CORACINUS: FOUR REMEDIES. THE SEA-PIG: TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a snake[140] which lives in the water, the fat and\r\ngall of which, carried about them by persons when in pursuit of\r\nthe crocodile, are said to be marvellously efficacious, the beast\r\nnot venturing, in such case, to make an attack upon them. As such\r\npreservative, they are still more effectual if mixed with the\r\nherbaceous plant known as potamogiton.[141] River-crabs,[142] taken\r\nfresh and beaten up and drunk in water, or the ashes of them, kept for\r\nthe purpose, are useful in all cases of poisoning, as a counter-poison:\r\ntaken with asses’ milk they are particularly serviceable as a\r\nneutralizer of the venom of the scorpion; goats’ milk or any other\r\nkind of milk being substituted where asses’ milk cannot be procured.\r\nWine, too, should also be used in all such cases. River-crabs, beaten\r\nup with ocimum,[143] and applied to scorpions, are fatal to them. They\r\nare possessed of similar virtues, also, for the bites of all other\r\nkinds of venomous animals, the scytale[144] in particular, adders, the\r\nsea-hare, and the bramble-frog. The ashes of them, preserved, are good\r\nfor persons who give symptoms of hydrophobia after being bitten by a\r\nmad dog, some adding gentian as well, and administering the mixture\r\nin wine. In cases, too, where hydrophobia has already appeared, it is\r\nrecommended that these ashes should be kneaded up into boluses with\r\nwine, and swallowed. If ten of these crabs are tied together with a\r\nhandful of ocimum,[145] all the scorpions in the neighbourhood, the\r\nmagicians say, will be attracted to the spot. They recommend, also,\r\nthat to wounds inflicted by the scorpion, these crabs, or the ashes of\r\nthem, should be applied, with ocimum. For all these purposes, however,\r\nsea-crabs, it should be remembered, are not so useful. Thrasyllus\r\ninforms us that there is nothing so antagonistic to serpents as crabs;\r\nthat swine, when stung by a serpent, cure themselves by eating them;\r\nand that, while the sun is in the sign of Cancer,[146] serpents suffer\r\nthe greatest tortures.\r\n\r\nThe flesh, too, of river-snails, eaten either raw or boiled, is an\r\nexcellent antidote to the venom of the scorpion, some persons keeping\r\nthem salted for the purpose. These snails are applied, also, topically\r\nto the wound.\r\n\r\nThe coracinus[147] is a fish peculiar to the river Nilus, it is true,\r\nbut the particulars we are here relating are for the benefit of all\r\nparts of the world: the flesh of it is most excellent as an application\r\nfor the cure of wounds inflicted by scorpions. In the number of the\r\npoisonous fishes we ought to reckon the sea-pig,[148] a fish which\r\ncauses great suffering to those who have been pierced with the pointed\r\nfin upon its back: the proper remedy in such case is the slime taken\r\nfrom the other parts of the body of the fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—THE SEA-CALF: TEN REMEDIES. THE MURÆNA: ONE REMEDY. THE\r\nHIPPOCAMPUS: NINE REMEDIES. THE SEA-URCHIN: ELEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn cases of hydrophobia resulting from the bite of the mad dog, the\r\npractice is to rub the patient’s face with the fat of the sea-calf; an\r\napplication rendered still more efficacious by the admixture of hyæna’s\r\nmarrow, oil of mastich, and wax. Bites inflicted by the muræna are\r\ncured by an application of the head of that fish, reduced to ashes. The\r\npastinaca,[149] also, is remedial for its own bite, the ashes of the\r\nsame fish, or of another of the same genus, being applied to the wound\r\nwith vinegar. When this fish is intended for food, every portion of the\r\nback that is of a saffron colour should be removed, as well as the\r\nwhole of the head: care, too, should be taken not to wash it over much;\r\nan observation equally applicable to all kinds of shell-fish, when\r\nintended for food, the flavour being deteriorated[150] thereby.\r\n\r\nThe hippocampus,[151] taken in drink, neutralizes the poison of the\r\nsea-hare. As a counter-poison to dorycnium,[152] sea-urchins are\r\nremarkably useful; as also in cases where persons have taken juice of\r\ncarpathum[153] internally; more particularly if the urchins are used\r\nwith the liquor in which they are boiled. Boiled sea-crabs, too, are\r\nlooked upon as highly efficacious in cases of poisoning by dorycnium;\r\nand as a neutralizer of the venom of the sea-hare they are particularly\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (6.)—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF OYSTERS: FIFTY-EIGHT REMEDIES AND\r\nOBSERVATIONS. PURPLES: NINE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOysters, too, neutralize the venom of the sea-hare—and now that we\r\nare speaking of oysters, it may possibly be thought that I have not\r\ntreated of this subject at sufficient length in the former part[154]\r\nof my work, seeing that for this long time past the palm has been\r\nawarded to them at our tables as a most exquisite dish. Oysters love\r\nfresh water and spots[155] where numerous rivers discharge themselves\r\ninto the sea; hence it is that the pelagia[156] are of such small size\r\nand so few in number. Still, however, we do find them breeding among\r\nrocks and in places far remote from the contact of fresh water, as in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Grynium[157] and of Myrina,[158] for example.\r\nGenerally speaking, they increase in size with the increase of the\r\nmoon, as already stated by us when[159] treating of the aquatic\r\nanimals: but it is at the beginning of summer, more particularly, and\r\nwhen the rays of the sun penetrate the shallow waters, that they are\r\nswollen with an abundance of milk.[160] This, too, would appear to be\r\nthe reason why they are so small when found out at sea; the opacity of\r\nthe water tending to arrest their growth, and the moping consequent\r\nthereon producing a comparative indisposition for food.\r\n\r\nOysters are of various colours; in Spain they are red, in Illyricum of\r\na tawny hue, and at Circeii[161] black, both in meat and shell. But\r\nin every country, those oysters are the most highly esteemed that are\r\ncompact without being slimy from their secretions, and are remarkable\r\nmore for their thickness than their breadth. They should never be taken\r\nin either muddy or sandy spots, but from a firm, hard bottom; the\r\nmeat[162] should be compressed, and not of a fleshy consistence; and\r\nthe oyster should be free from fringed edges, and lying wholly in the\r\ncavity of the shell. Persons of experience in these matters add another\r\ncharacteristic; a fine purple thread, they say, should run round the\r\nmargins of the beard, this being looked upon as a sign of superior\r\nquality, and obtaining for them their name of “calliblephara.”[163]\r\n\r\nOysters are all the better for travelling and being removed to new\r\nwaters; thus, for example, the oysters of Brundisium, it is thought,\r\nwhen fed in the waters of Avernus, both retain their own native juices\r\nand acquire the flavour of those of Lake Lucrinus.[164] Thus much with\r\nreference to the meat of the oyster; we will now turn to the various\r\ncountries which produce it, so that no coast may be deprived of the\r\nhonours which properly belong to it. But in giving this description\r\nwe will speak in the language of another, using the words of a writer\r\nwho has evinced more careful discernment in treating of this subject\r\nthan any of the other authors of our day. These then are the words of\r\nMucianus, in reference to the oyster:—“The oysters of Cyzicus[165] are\r\nlarger than those of Lake Lucrinus,[166] fresher[167] than those of\r\nthe British coasts,[168] sweeter[169] than those of Medulæ,[170] more\r\ntasty[171] than those of Ephesus, more plump than those of Lucus,[172]\r\nless slimy than those of Coryphas,[173] more delicate than those of\r\nIstria,[174] and whiter than those of Circeii.”[175] For all this,\r\nhowever, it is a fact well ascertained that there are no oysters\r\nfresher or more delicate than those of Circeii, last mentioned.\r\n\r\nAccording to the historians of the expedition of Alexander, there\r\nwere oysters found in the Indian Sea a foot[176] in diameter: among\r\nourselves, too, the nomenclature of some spendthrift and gourmand has\r\nfound for certain oysters the name of “tridacna,”[177] wishing it to\r\nbe understood thereby, that they are so large as to require three\r\nbites in eating them. We will take the present opportunity of stating\r\nall the medicinal properties that are attributed to oysters. They are\r\nsingularly refreshing[178] to the stomach, and tend to restore the\r\nappetite. Luxury, too, has imparted to them an additional coolness by\r\nburying them in snow, thus making a medley of the produce of the tops\r\nof mountains and the bottom of the sea. Oysters are slightly laxative\r\nto the bowels; and boiled in honied wine, they relieve tenesmus, in\r\ncases where it is unattended with ulceration. They act detergently also\r\nupon ulcerations of the bladder.[179] Boiled in their shells, unopened\r\njust as they come to hand, oysters are marvellously efficacious for\r\nrheumatic defluxions. Calcined oyster-shells, mixed with honey,\r\nallay affections of the uvula and of the tonsillary glands: they are\r\nsimilarly used for imposthumes of the parotid glands, inflamed tumours,\r\nand indurations of the mamillæ. Applied with water, these ashes are\r\ngood for ulcerations of the head, and impart a plumpness to the skin in\r\nfemales. They are sprinkled, too, upon burns, and are highly esteemed\r\nas a dentifrice. Applied with vinegar, they are good for the removal of\r\nprurigo and of pituitous eruptions. Beaten up in a raw state, they are\r\ncurative of scrofula and of chilblains upon the feet.\r\n\r\nPurples, too, are useful[180] as a counterpoison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—SEA-WEED: TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Nicander, sea-weed is also a theriac.[181] There are\r\nnumerous varieties of it, as already[182] stated; one, for instance,\r\nwith an elongated leaf, another red, another again with a broader leaf,\r\nand another crisped. The most esteemed kind of all is that which grows\r\noff the shores of Crete, upon the rocks there, close to the ground:\r\nit being used also for dyeing wool, as it has the property[183] of\r\nso fixing the colours as never to allow of their being washed out.\r\nNicander recommends it to be taken with wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23. (7.)—REMEDIES FOR ALOPECY, CHANGE OF COLOUR IN THE HAIR, AND\r\nULCERATIONS OF THE HEAD. THE SEA-MOUSE: TWO REMEDIES, THE SEA-SCORPION:\r\nTWELVE REMEDIES. THE LEECH: SEVEN REMEDIES. THE MUREX: THIRTEEN\r\nREMEDIES. THE CONCHYLIUM: FIVE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAshes of the hippocampus,[184] mixed with nitre[185] and hog’s lard, or\r\nelse used solely with vinegar, are curative of alopecy; the skin being\r\nfirst prepared for the reception of the necessary medicaments by an\r\napplication of powdered bone of sæpia.[186] Alopecy is cured also with\r\nashes of the sea-mouse,[187] mixed with oil; ashes of the sea-urchin,\r\nburnt, flesh and all together; the gall of the sea-scorpion;[188] or\r\nelse ashes of three frogs burnt alive in an earthen pot, applied with\r\nhoney, or what is still better, in combination with tar. Leeches left\r\nto putrefy for forty days in red wine stain the hair black. Others,\r\nagain, recommend one sextarius of leeches to be left to putrefy the\r\nsame number of days in a leaden vessel, with two sextarii of vinegar,\r\nthe hair to be well rubbed with the mixture in the sun. According\r\nto Sornatius, this preparation is naturally so penetrating, that if\r\nfemales, when they apply it, do not take the precaution of keeping\r\nsome oil in the mouth, the teeth even will become blackened thereby.\r\nAshes of burnt shells of the murex or purple are used as a liniment,\r\nwith honey, for ulcerations of the head; the shells, too, of other\r\nshell-fish,[189] powdered merely, and not calcined, are very useful\r\nfor the same purpose, applied with water. For the cure of head-ache,\r\ncastoreum is employed, in combination with peucedanum[190] and oil of\r\nroses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE EYES AND EYELIDS. TWO REMEDIES\r\nDERIVED FROM THE FAT OF FISHES. THE CALLIONYMUS: THREE REMEDIES. THE\r\nGALL OF THE CORACINUS: ONE REMEDY. THE SÆPIA: TWENTY-FOUR REMEDIES.\r\nICHTHYOCOLLA: FIVE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fat of all kinds of fish, both fresh-water as well as sea fish,\r\nmelted in the sun and incorporated with honey, is an excellent\r\nimprover of the eye-sight;[191] the same, too, with castoreum,[192] in\r\ncombination with honey. The gall of the callionymus[193] heals marks\r\nupon the eyes and cauterizes fleshy excrescences about those organs:\r\nindeed, there is no fish with a larger quantity of gall than this, an\r\nopinion expressed too by Menander in his Comedies.[194] This fish is\r\nknown also as the “uranoscopos,”[195] from the eyes being situate in\r\nthe upper part of the head.[196] The gall, too, of the coracinus[197]\r\nhas the effect of sharpening the eyesight.\r\n\r\nThe gall of the red sea-scorpion,[198] used with stale oil or Attic\r\nhoney, disperses incipient cataract; for which purpose, the application\r\nshould be made three times, on alternate days. A similar method is\r\nalso employed for removing indurations[199] of the membrane of the\r\neyes. The surmullet, used as a diet, weakens the eyesight, it is said.\r\nThe sea-hare is poisonous itself, but the ashes of it are useful as\r\nan application for preventing superfluous hairs on the eyelids from\r\ngrowing again, when they have been once pulled out by the roots. For\r\nthis purpose, however, the smaller the fish is, the better. Small\r\nscallops, too, are salted and beaten up with cedar resin for a similar\r\npurpose, or else the frogs known as “diopetes”[200] and “calamitæ,”\r\nare used; the blood of them being applied with vine gum to the eyelids,\r\nafter the hairs have been removed.\r\n\r\nPowdered shell[201] of sæpia, applied with woman’s milk, allays\r\nswellings and inflammations of the eyes; employed by itself it removes\r\neruptions of the eyelids. When this remedy is used, it is the practice\r\nto turn up the eyelids, and to leave the medicament there a few moments\r\nonly; after which, the part is anointed with oil of roses, and the\r\ninflammation modified by the application of a bread-poultice. Powdered\r\nbone of sæpia is used also for the treatment of nyctalopy, being\r\napplied to the eyes with vinegar. Reduced to ashes, this substance\r\nremoves scales upon the eyes: applied with honey, it effaces marks upon\r\nthose organs: and used with salt and cadmia,[202] one drachma of each,\r\nit disperses webs which impede the eyesight, as also albugo in the eyes\r\nof cattle. They say, too, that if the eyelids are rubbed with the small\r\nbone[203] taken from this fish, a perfect cure will be experienced.\r\n\r\nSea-urchins, applied with vinegar, cause epinyctis to disappear.\r\nAccording to what the magicians say, they should be burnt with vipers’\r\nskins and frogs, and the ashes sprinkled in the drink; a great\r\nimprovement of the eyesight being guaranteed as the sure result.\r\n\r\n“Ichthyocolla”[204] is the name given to a fish with a glutinous skin;\r\nthe glue made from which is also known by the same name, and is highly\r\nuseful for the removal of epinyctis. Some persons, however, assert that\r\nit is from the belly of the fish, and not the skin—as in the case of\r\nbull glue—that the ichthyocolla is prepared. That of Pontus[205] is\r\nhighly esteemed: it is white, free from veins or scales, and dissolves\r\nwith the greatest rapidity. The proper way of using it, is to cut it\r\ninto small pieces, and then to leave it to soak in water or vinegar\r\na night and a day, after which it should be pounded with sea-shore\r\npebbles, to make it melt the more easily. It is generally asserted that\r\nthis substance is good for pains in the head and for tetanus.\r\n\r\nThe right eye of a frog, suspended from the neck in a piece of cloth\r\nmade from wool of the natural colour,[206] is a cure for ophthalmia in\r\nthe right eye; and the left eye of a frog, similarly suspended, for\r\nophthalmia in the left. If the eyes, too, of a frog are taken out at\r\nthe time of the moon’s conjunction, and similarly worn by the patient,\r\nenclosed in an eggshell, they will effectually remove indurations of\r\nthe membrane of the eyes. The rest of the flesh applied topically,\r\nremoves all marks resulting from blows. The eyes, too, of a crab, worn\r\nattached to the neck, by way of amulet, are a cure for ophthalmia, it\r\nis said. There is a small frog[207] which lives in reed-beds and among\r\ngrass more particularly, never croaks, being quite destitute of voice,\r\nis of a green colour, and is apt to cause tympanitis in cattle, if\r\nthey should happen to swallow it. The slimy moisture on this reptile’s\r\nbody, scraped off with a spatula and applied to the eyes, greatly\r\nimproves the sight, they say: the flesh, too, is employed as a topical\r\napplication for the removal of pains in the eyes.\r\n\r\nSome persons take fifteen frogs, and after spitting them upon as many\r\nbulrushes, put them into a new earthen vessel: they then mix the juices\r\nwhich flow from them, with gum of the white vine,[208] and use it as\r\nan application for the eye-lids; first pulling out such eye-lashes\r\nas are in the way, and then dropping the preparation with the point\r\nof a needle into the places from which the hairs have been removed.\r\nMeges[209] used to prepare a depilatory for the eyelids, by killing\r\nfrogs in vinegar, and leaving them to putrefy; for which purpose\r\nhe employed the spotted frogs which make their appearance in vast\r\nnumbers[210] during the rains of autumn. Ashes of burnt leeches, it\r\nis thought, applied in vinegar, are productive of a similar effect;\r\ncare must be taken, however, to burn them in a new earthen vessel.\r\nDried liver, too, of the tunny,[211] made up into an ointment, in\r\nthe proportion of four denarii, with oil of cedar, and applied as\r\na depilatory for nine months together, is considered to be highly\r\neffectual for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE EARS. THE BATIA: ONE REMEDY. THE\r\nBACCHUS OR MYXON: TWO REMEDIES. THE SEA-LOUSE: TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor diseases of the ears, fresh gall of the fish called “batia”[212]\r\nis remarkably good; the same, too, when it has been kept in wine. The\r\ngall, also, of the bacchus,[213] by some known as the “myxon,” is\r\nequally good; as also that of the callionymus,[214] injected into the\r\nears with oil of roses, or else castoreum,[215] used with poppy-juice.\r\nThere are certain animals too, known as “sea-lice,”[216] which are\r\nrecommended as an injection for the ears, beaten up with vinegar.\r\nWool, too, that has been dyed with the juice of the murex, employed\r\nby itself, is highly useful for this purpose; some persons, however\r\nmoisten it with vinegar and nitre.[217]\r\n\r\nOthers, again, more particularly recommend for all affections of the\r\nears one cyathus of the best garum,[218] with one cyathus and a half\r\nof honey, and one cyathus of vinegar, the whole gently boiled in a new\r\npot over a slow fire, and skimmed with a feather every now and then:\r\nwhen it has become wholly free from scum, it is injected lukewarm into\r\nthe ears. In cases where the ears are swollen, the same authorities\r\nrecommend that the swellings should be first reduced with juice of\r\ncoriander. The fat of frogs, injected into the ears, instantly removes\r\nall pains in these organs. The juice of river-crabs, kneaded up with\r\nbarley-meal, is a most effectual remedy for wounds in the ears. Shells\r\nof the murex, reduced to ashes, and applied with honey, or the burnt\r\nshells of other shell-fish,[219] used with honied wine, are curative of\r\nimposthumes of the parotid glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—REMEDIES FOR TOOTH-ACHE. THE DOG-FISH: FOUR REMEDIES. WHALE’S\r\nFLESH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTooth-ache is alleviated by scarifying the gums with bones of the\r\nsea-dragon, or by rubbing the teeth once a year with the brains of a\r\ndog-fish[220] boiled in oil, and kept for the purpose. It is a very\r\ngood plan too, for the cure of tooth-ache, to lance the gums with\r\nthe sting of the pastinaca[221] in some cases. This sting, too, is\r\npounded, and applied to the teeth with white hellebore, having the\r\neffect of extracting them without the slightest difficulty. Another of\r\nthese remedies is, ashes of salted fish calcined in an earthen vessel,\r\nmixed with powdered marble. Stale cybium,[222] rinsed in a new earthen\r\nvessel, and then pounded, is very useful for the cure of tooth-ache.\r\nEqually good, it is said, are the back-bones of all kinds of salt fish,\r\npounded and applied in a liniment. A decoction is made of a single frog\r\nboiled in one hemina of vinegar, and the teeth are rinsed with it, the\r\ndecoction being retained in the mouth. In cases where a repugnance\r\nexisted to making use of this remedy, Sallustius Dionysius[223] used\r\nto suspend frogs over boiling vinegar by the hind legs, so as to make\r\nthem discharge their humours into the vinegar by the mouth, using\r\nconsiderable numbers of frogs for the purpose: to those, however, who\r\nhad a stronger stomach, he prescribed the frogs themselves, eaten with\r\ntheir broth. It is generally thought, too, that this recipe applies\r\nmore particularly to the double teeth, and that the vinegar prepared as\r\nabove-mentioned, is remarkably useful for strengthening them when loose.\r\n\r\nFor this last purpose, some persons cut off the legs of two frogs,\r\nand then macerate the bodies in two heminæ of wine, recommending this\r\npreparation as a collutory for strengthening loose teeth. Others attach\r\nthe frogs, whole, to the exterior of the jaws:[224] and with some it is\r\nthe practice to boil ten frogs, in three sextarii of vinegar, down to\r\none-third, and to use the decoction as a strengthener of loose teeth.\r\nBy certain authorities, too, it has been recommended to boil the hearts\r\nof six-and-thirty frogs beneath a copper vessel, in one sextarius of\r\nold oil, and then to inject the decoction into the ear on the same side\r\nof the jaw as the part affected: while others again have used, as an\r\napplication for the teeth, a frog’s liver, boiled, and beaten up with\r\nhoney. All the preparations above described will be found still more\r\nefficacious if made from the sea-frog.[225] In cases where the teeth\r\nare carious and emit an offensive smell, it is recommended to dry some\r\nwhale’s[226] flesh in an oven for a night, and then to add an equal\r\nquantity of salt, and use the mixture as a dentifrice. “Enhydris”[227]\r\nis the name given by the Greeks to a snake that lives in the water.\r\nWith the four upper teeth of this reptile, it is the practice, for the\r\ncure of aching in the upper teeth, to lance the upper gums, and with\r\nthe four lower teeth, for aching in the lower. Some persons, however,\r\ncontent themselves with using an eyetooth only. Ashes, too, of burnt\r\ncrabs are used for this purpose; and the murex, reduced to ashes, makes\r\nan excellent dentifrice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—REMEDIES FOR LICHENS, AND FOR SPOTS UPON THE FACE. THE\r\nDOLPHIN: NINE REMEDIES. COLUTHIA OR CORYPHIA: THREE REMEDIES.\r\nHALCYONEUM: SEVEN REMEDIES. THE TUNNY: FIVE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLichens and leprous spots are removed by applying the fat of the\r\nsea-calf,[228] ashes of the mæna[229] in combination with three oboli\r\nof honey, liver of the pastinaca[230] boiled in oil, or ashes of the\r\ndolphin or hippocampus[231] mixed with water. After the parts have\r\nbeen duly excoriated, a cicatrizing treatment ought to be pursued.\r\nSome persons bake dolphin’s liver in an earthen vessel, till a grease\r\nflows therefrom like oil[232] in appearance: this they use by way of\r\nointment for these diseases.\r\n\r\nBurnt shells of the murex or purple, applied with honey, have a\r\ndetergent effect upon spots on the face in females: used as an\r\napplication for seven consecutive days, a fomentation made of white\r\nof eggs being substituted on the eighth, they efface wrinkles, and\r\nplump out the skin. To the genus “murex” belong the shell-fish known\r\nby the Greeks as “coluthia” or “coryphia,” equally turbinated, but\r\nconsiderably smaller: for all the above purposes they are still more\r\nefficacious, and the use of them tends to preserve the sweetness of\r\nthe breath. Fish-glue[233] effaces wrinkles and plumps out the skin;\r\nbeing boiled for the purpose in water some four hours, and then\r\npounded and kneaded up till it attains a thin consistency, like that\r\nof honey. After being thus prepared, it is put by in a new vessel for\r\nkeeping; and, when wanted for use, is mixed, in the proportion of four\r\ndrachmæ, with two drachmæ of sulphur, two of alkanet, and eight of\r\nlitharge; the whole being sprinkled with water and beaten up together.\r\nThe preparation is then applied to the face, and is washed off at the\r\nend of four hours. For the cure of freckles and other affections of\r\nthe face, calcined bones of cuttle-fish are also used; an application\r\nwhich is equally good for the removal of fleshy excrescences and the\r\ndispersion of running sores.\r\n\r\n(8.) For the cure of itch-scab, a frog is boiled in five semisextarii\r\nof sea-water, the decoction being reduced to the consistency of honey.\r\nThere is a sea production called “halcyoneum,” composed, as some\r\nthink, of the nests[234] of the birds known as the “halcyon”[235] and\r\n“ceyx,” or, according to others, of the concretion of sea-foam, or of\r\nsome slime of the sea, or a certain lanuginous inflorescence thrown\r\nup by it. Of this halcyoneum there are four different kinds; the\r\nfirst, of an ashy colour, of a compact substance, and possessed of a\r\npungent odour; the second, soft, of a milder nature, and with a smell\r\nalmost identical with that of sea-weed; the third, whiter, and with\r\na variegated surface; the fourth, more like pumice in appearance, and\r\nclosely resembling rotten sponge. The best of all is that which nearly\r\nborders upon a purple hue, and is known as the “Milesian” kind: the\r\nwhiter it is, the less highly it is esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe properties of halcyoneum are ulcerative and detergent: when\r\nrequired for use, it is parched and applied without oil. It is quite\r\nmarvellous how efficiently it removes leprous sores, lichens, and\r\nfreckles, used in combination with lupines and two oboli of sulphur.\r\nIt is employed, also, for the removal of marks upon the eyes.[236]\r\nAndreas[237] has recommended for the cure of leprosy ashes of burnt\r\ncrabs, with oil; and Attalus,[238] fresh fat of tunny.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—REMEDIES FOR SCROFULA, IMPOSTHUMES OF THE PAROTID GLANDS,\r\nQUINSY, AND DISEASES OF THE FAUCES. THE MÆNA: THIRTEEN REMEDIES. THE\r\nSEA-SCOLOPENDRA: TWO REMEDIES. THE SAURUS: ONE REMEDY. SHELL-FISH: ONE\r\nREMEDY. THE SILURUS: FIFTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcerations of the mouth are cured by an application of brine in\r\nwhich mænæ[239] have been pickled, in combination with calcined heads\r\nof the fish, and honey. For the cure of scrofula, it is a good plan\r\nto prick the sores with the small bone that is found in the tail\r\nof the fish known as the sea-frog;[240] care being taken to avoid\r\nmaking a wound, and to repeat the operation daily, until a perfect\r\ncure is effected. The same property, too, belongs to the sting of the\r\npastinaca, and to the sea-hare, applied topically to the sores: but in\r\nboth cases due care must be taken to remove them in an instant. Shells\r\nof sea-urchins are bruised, also, and applied with vinegar; shells\r\nalso of sea-scolopendræ,[241] applied with honey; and river-crabs\r\npounded or calcined, and applied with honey. Bones, too, of the sæpia,\r\ntriturated and applied with stale axle-grease, are marvellously useful\r\nfor this purpose. This last preparation is used, also, for the cure of\r\nimposthumes of the parotid glands; a purpose for which the liver of the\r\nsea-fish known as the “saurus”[242] is employed. Nay, even more than\r\nthis, fragments of earthen vessels in which salt fish have been kept\r\nare pounded with stale axle-grease, and applied to scrofulous sores and\r\nimposthumes of the parotid glands; as also calcined murex, incorporated\r\nwith oil. Stiffness in the neck is allayed by taking what are known as\r\nsea-lice,[243] in doses of one drachma in drink, taking castoreum[244]\r\nmixed with pepper in honied wine, or making a decoction of frogs in oil\r\nand salt, and taking the liquor.\r\n\r\nOpisthotony, too, and tetanus are treated in a similar manner; and\r\nspasms, with the addition of pepper. Ashes of burnt heads of salted\r\nmænæ are applied externally, with honey, for the cure of quinsy; as\r\nalso a decoction of frogs, boiled in vinegar, a preparation which is\r\nequally good for affections of the tonsillary glands. River-crabs,\r\npounded, one to each hemina of water, are used as a gargle for the cure\r\nof quinsy; or else they are taken with wine and hot water. Garum,[245]\r\nput beneath the uvula with a spoon, effectually cures diseases of that\r\npart. The silurus,[246] used as food, either fresh or salted, improves\r\nthe voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—REMEDIES FOR COUGH AND DISEASES OF THE CHEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurmullets act as an emetic, dried and pounded, and taken in drink.\r\nCastoreum, taken fasting, with a small quantity of hammoniacum[247]\r\nin oxymel, is extremely good for asthma: spasms, too, in the stomach\r\nare assuaged by taking a similar potion with warm oxymel. Frogs stewed\r\nin their own liquor in the saucepan, the same way in fact that fish\r\nare dressed, are good for a cough, it is said. In some cases, also,\r\nfrogs are suspended by the legs, and after their juices[248] have been\r\nreceived in a platter, it is recommended to gut them, and the entrails\r\nbeing first carefully removed, to preserve them for the above purpose.\r\nThere is a small frog,[249] also, which ascends trees, and croaks aloud\r\nthere: if a person suffering from cough spits into its mouth and then\r\nlets it go, he will experience a cure, it is said. For cough attended\r\nwith spitting of blood, it is recommended to beat up the raw flesh of a\r\nsnail, and to drink it in hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30. (9.)—REMEDIES FOR PAINS IN THE LIVER AND SIDE. THE ELONGATED\r\nCONCH: SIX REMEDIES. THE TETHEA: FIVE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor pains in the liver, a sea-scorpion is killed in wine, and the\r\nliquid is taken. The meat, too, of the elongated conch[250] is taken\r\nwith honied wine and water, in equal quantities, or, if there are\r\nsymptoms of fever, with hydromel. Pains in the side are assuaged\r\nby taking the flesh of the hippocampus,[251] grilled, or else the\r\ntethea,[252] very similar to the oyster, with the ordinary food. For\r\nsciatica, the pickle of the silurus is injected, by way of clyster.\r\nThe flesh of conchs, too, is prescribed, for fifteen days, in doses of\r\nthree oboli soaked in two sextarii of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE BOWELS. SEA-WORT: ONE REMEDY.\r\nTHE MYAX: TWENTY-FIVE REMEDIES. THE MITULUS: EIGHT REMEDIES. PELORIDES:\r\nONE REMEDY. SERIPHUM: TWO REMEDIES. THE ERYTHINUS: TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silurus,[253] taken in its broth, or the torpedo,[254] used as\r\nfood, acts as a laxative upon the bowels. There is a sea-wort,[255]\r\nalso, similar in appearance to the cultivated cabbage: it is injurious\r\nto the stomach, but acts most efficiently as a purgative, requiring\r\nto be cooked with fat meat for the purpose, in consequence of its\r\nextreme acridity. The broth, too, of all boiled fish is good for\r\nthis purpose; it acting, also, as a strong diuretic, taken with wine\r\nmore particularly. The best kind of all is that prepared from the\r\nsea-scorpion, the iulis,[256] and rock-fish in general, as they are\r\ndestitute of all rankness and are free from fat. The proper way of\r\ncooking them is with dill, parsley, coriander, and leeks, with the\r\naddition of oil and salt. Stale cybium,[257] too, acts as a purgative,\r\nand is particularly useful for carrying off crudities, pituitous\r\nhumours, and bile.\r\n\r\nThe myax[258] is of a purgative nature, a shell-fish of which we shall\r\ntake this opportunity of giving the natural history at length. These\r\nfish collect together in masses, like the murex,[259] and are found\r\nin spots covered with sea-weed. They are the finest eating in autumn,\r\nand are found in the greatest perfection in places where fresh-water\r\nstreams discharge themselves into the sea; for which reason it is that\r\nthose of Egypt are held in such high esteem. As the winter advances,\r\nthey contract a bitter flavour, and assume a reddish hue. The liquor\r\nof these fish, it is said, acts as a purgative upon the bowels and\r\nbladder, has a detergent effect upon the intestines, acts aperiently\r\nupon all the passages, purges the kidneys, and diminishes the blood\r\nand adipose secretions. Hence it is that these shell-fish are found of\r\nthe greatest use for the treatment of dropsy, for the regulation of\r\nthe catamenia, and for the removal of jaundice, all diseases of the\r\njoints, and flatulency. They are very good, also, for the reduction\r\nof obesity, for diseases of the bile and of the pituitous secretions,\r\nfor affections of the lungs, liver, and spleen, and for rheumatic\r\ndefluxions. The only inconvenience resulting from them is, that they\r\nirritate the throat and impede the articulation. They have, also, a\r\nhealing effect upon ulcers of a serpiginous nature, or which stand in\r\nneed of detergents, as also upon carcinomatous sores. Calcined, the\r\nsame way as the murex, and employed with honey, they are curative of\r\nbites inflicted either by dogs or human beings, and of leprous spots or\r\nfreckles. The ashes of them, rinsed, are good for the removal of films\r\nupon the eyes, granulations of those organs and indurations of the\r\nmembrane, as also for diseases of the gums and teeth, and for pituitous\r\neruptions. They serve, also, as an antidote to dorycnium[260] and to\r\nopocarpathon.[261] There are two species of this shell-fish, of a\r\ndegenerate kind: the mitulus,[262] which has a strong flavour, and a\r\nsaltish taste; and the myisca,[263] which differs from the former in\r\nthe roundness of its shell, is somewhat smaller, and is covered with\r\nfilaments, the shell being thinner, and the meat of a sweeter flavour.\r\nThe ashes, also, of the mitulus, like those of the murex, are possessed\r\nof certain caustic properties, and are very useful for the removal of\r\nleprous spots, freckles, and blemishes of the skin. They are rinsed,\r\ntoo, in the same manner as lead,[264] for the removal of swellings\r\nof the eyelids, of indurations of the membranes, and of films upon\r\nthe eyes, as also of sordid ulcers upon other parts of the body, and\r\nof pustules upon the head. The meat of them, also, is employed as an\r\napplication for bites inflicted by dogs.\r\n\r\nAs to pelorides,[265] they act as a gentle laxative upon the bowels, an\r\neffect equally produced by castoreum, taken in doses of two drachmæ,\r\nin hydromel: where, however, a more drastic purgative is required,\r\none drachma of dried garden-cucumber root is added, and two drachmæ\r\nof aphronitrum.[266] The tethea[267] is good for griping pains in the\r\nbowels and for attacks of flatulency: they are generally found adhering\r\nto the leaves of marine plants, sucking their nutriment therefrom, and\r\nmay be rather looked upon as a sort of fungus than as a fish. They\r\nare useful, also, for the removal of tenesmus and of diseases of the\r\nkidneys.\r\n\r\nThere grows also in the sea a kind of absinthium, known by some persons\r\nas “seriphum,”[268] and found in the vicinity of Taposiris,[269] in\r\nEgypt, more particularly. It is of a more slender form than the land\r\nabsinthium, acts as a purgative upon the bowels, and effectually\r\nremoves intestinal worms. The sæpia, too, is a laxative; for which\r\npurpose these fish are administered[270] with the food, boiled with a\r\nmixture of oil, salt, and meal. Salted mænæ,[271] applied with bull’s\r\ngall to the navel, acts as a purgative upon the bowels.\r\n\r\nThe liquor of fish, boiled in the saucepan with lettuces, dispels\r\ntenesmus. River-crabs,[272] beaten up and taken with water, act\r\nastringently upon the bowels, and they have a diuretic effect, if\r\ntaken with white wine. Deprived of the legs, and taken in doses of\r\nthree oboli with myrrh and iris, one drachma of each, they disperse\r\nurinary calculi. For the cure of the iliac passion and of attacks of\r\nflatulency, castoreum[273] should be taken, with seed of daucus[274]\r\nand of parsley, a pinch in three fingers of each, the whole being mixed\r\nwith four cyathi of warm honied wine. Griping pains in the bowels\r\nshould be treated with castoreum and a mixture of dill and wine. The\r\nfish called “erythinus,”[275] used as food, acts astringently upon the\r\nbowels. Dysentery is cured by taking frogs boiled with squills, and\r\nprepared in the form of boluses, or else hearts of frogs beaten up with\r\nhoney, as Niceratus[276] recommends. For the cure of jaundice, salt\r\nfish should be taken with pepper, the patient abstaining from all other\r\nkinds of meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—-REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE SPLEEN, FOR URINARY CALCULI,\r\nAND FOR AFFECTIONS OF THE BLADDER. THE SOLE: ONE REMEDY. THE TURBOT:\r\nONE REMEDY. THE BLENDIUS: ONE REMEDY. THE SEA-NETTLE: SEVEN REMEDIES.\r\nTHE PULMO MARINUS: SIX REMEDIES. ONYCHES: FOUR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the cure of spleen diseases, the fish known as the sole[277]\r\nis applied to that part; the torpedo,[278] also, or else a\r\nlive turbot;[279] it being then set at liberty in the sea. The\r\nsea-scorpion,[280] killed in wine, is a cure for diseases of the\r\nbladder and for urinary calculi; the stone, also, that is found in the\r\ntail[281] of this last fish, taken in drink, in doses of one obolus;\r\nthe liver of the enhydris;[282] and the ashes of the fish called\r\n“blendius;”[283] taken with rue. In the head, too, of the fish called\r\n“bacchus,”[284] there are found certain small stones, as it were:\r\nthese, taken in water, six in number, are an excellent cure for urinary\r\ncalculi. They say, too, that the sea-nettle,[285] taken in wine, is\r\nvery useful for this purpose, as also the pulmo marinus,[286] boiled\r\nin water. The eggs of the sæpia have a diuretic effect, and carry off\r\npituitous humours from the kidneys. Ruptures and convulsions are very\r\neffectually treated by taking river-crabs,[287] bruised in asses’ milk\r\nmore particularly; and urinary calculi by drinking sea-urchins pounded,\r\nspines and all, in wine; the due proportion being one semisextarius of\r\nwine for each urchin, and the treatment being continued till its good\r\neffects are visible. The flesh, too, of the sea-urchin, taken as food,\r\nis very useful as a remedy for the same malady.\r\n\r\nScallops[288] also, taken as food, act detergently upon the bladder:\r\nthe male fish is by some persons called “donax,” and by others “aulos,”\r\nthe female being known as “onyx.”[289] The male scallop has a diuretic\r\neffect: the flesh of the female is sweeter than that of the male, and\r\nof an uniform colour. The eggs, too, of the sæpia promote the urinary\r\nsecretions, and act detergently upon the kidneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—REMEDIES FOR INTESTINAL HERNIA, AND FOR DISEASES OF THE\r\nRECTUM. THE WATER-SNAKE: ONE REMEDY. THE HYDRUS: ONE REMEDY. THE\r\nMULLET: ONE REMEDY. THE PELAMIS: THREE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the cure of intestinal hernia the sea-hare is applied, bruised with\r\nhoney. The liver of the water-snake,[290] and that of the hydrus,[291]\r\nbruised and taken in drink, are remedial for urinary calculi. Sciatica\r\nis cured by using the pickle of the silurus[292] as a clyster, the\r\nbowels being first thoroughly purged. For chafing of the fundament,\r\nan application is made of heads of mullets and surmullets, reduced\r\nto ashes; for which purpose they are calcined in an earthen vessel,\r\nand must be applied in combination with honey. Calcined heads, too,\r\nof the fish known as mænæ[293] are useful for the cure of chaps and\r\ncondylomata; as also heads of salted pelamides,[294] reduced to ashes,\r\nor calcined cybium,[295] applied with honey.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo,[296] applied topically, reduces procidence of the rectum.\r\nRiver-crabs,[297] reduced to ashes, and applied with oil and wax, are\r\ncurative of chaps of the fundament: sea-crabs, too, are equally useful\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—-REMEDIES FOR INFLAMED TUMOURS, AND FOR DISEASES OF THE\r\nGENERATIVE ORGANS. THE SCIÆNA: ONE REMEDY. THE PERCH: FOUR REMEDIES.\r\nTHE SQUATINA: THREE REMEDIES. THE SMARIS: THREE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pickle of the coracinus[298] disperses inflammatory tumours; an\r\neffect which is equally produced by using the calcined intestines\r\nand scales of the sciæna.[299] The sea-scorpion,[300] too, is used\r\nfor the same purpose, boiled in wine, and applied as a fomentation to\r\nthe part affected. Shells of sea-urchins, bruised and applied with\r\nwater, act as a check upon incipient inflammatory tumours. Ashes of\r\nthe murex, or of the purple, are employed in either case, whether it\r\nis wanted to disperse inflammatory tumours in an incipient state, or\r\nto bring them to a head and break them. Some authorities prescribe\r\nthe following preparation: of wax and frankincense twenty drachmæ, of\r\nlitharge forty drachmæ, of calcined murex ten drachmæ, and of old oil,\r\none semisextarius. Salt fish, boiled and applied by itself, is highly\r\nuseful for the above purposes.\r\n\r\nRiver crabs, bruised and applied, disperse pustules on the generative\r\norgans: the same, too, with calcined heads of mænæ,[301] or the flesh\r\nof that fish, boiled and applied. Heads of salted perch,[302] reduced\r\nto ashes, and applied with honey, are equally useful for the purpose;\r\nor else calcined heads of pelamides,[303] or skin of the squatina\r\nreduced to ashes.[304] It is the skin of this fish that is used, as\r\nalready[305] stated, for giving a polish to wood; for the sea even, we\r\nfind, furnishes its aid to our artificers. For a similar purpose the\r\nfishes called “smarides”[306] are applied topically; as also ashes of\r\nthe shell of the murex or of the purple, applied with honey; which last\r\nare still more efficacious when the flesh has been burnt with the shell.\r\n\r\nSalt fish, boiled with honey, is particularly good for the cure of\r\ncarbuncles upon the generative organs. For relaxation of the testes,\r\nthe slime[307] of snails is recommended, applied in the form of a\r\nliniment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—REMEDIES FOR INCONTINENCE OF URINE. THE OPHIDION: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flesh of hippocampi,[308] grilled and taken frequently as food,\r\nis a cure for incontinence of urine; the ophidion,[309] too, a little\r\nfish similar to the conger in appearance, eaten with a lily root; or\r\nthe small fry found in the bellies of larger fish that have swallowed\r\nthem, reduced to ashes and taken in water. It is recommended, too, to\r\nburn[310] African snails, both shells and flesh, and to administer the\r\nashes with wine[311] of Signia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—REMEDIES FOR GOUT, AND FOR PAINS IN THE FEET. THE BEAVER:\r\nFOUR REMEDIES. BRYON: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the cure of gout and of diseases of the joints, oil is useful\r\nin which the intestines of frogs have been boiled. Ashes, too, of\r\nburnt bramble-frogs[312] are similarly employed, with stale grease;\r\nin addition to which, some persons use calcined barley, the three\r\ningredients being mixed in equal proportions. It is recommended too,\r\nin cases of gout, to rub the parts affected with a sea-hare,[313]\r\nfresh caught, and to wear shoes made of beaver’s skin, Pontic beaver\r\nmore particularly, or else of sea-calf’s[314] skin, an animal the fat\r\nof which is very useful for the purpose: the same being the case also\r\nwith bryon, a plant of which we have already spoken,[315] similar to\r\nthe lettuce in appearance, but with more wrinkled leaves, and destitute\r\nof stem. This plant is of a styptic nature, and, applied topically, it\r\ntends to modify the paroxysms of gout. The same, too, with sea-weed, of\r\nwhich we have also spoken already;[316] due precaution being taken not\r\nto apply it dry.\r\n\r\nChilblains are cured by applying the pulmo marinus;[317] ashes of\r\nsea-crabs with oil; river crabs,[318] bruised and burnt to ashes and\r\nkneaded up with oil; or else fat of the silurus.[319] In diseases of\r\nthe joints, the paroxysms are modified by applying fresh frogs every\r\nnow and then: some authorities recommend that they should be split\r\nasunder before being applied. The liquor from mussels[320] and other\r\nshell-fish has a tendency to make flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—REMEDIES FOR EPILEPSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpileptic patients, as already[321] stated, are recommended to drink\r\nthe rennet of the sea-calf,[322] mixed with mares’ milk or asses’\r\nmilk, or else with pomegranate juice, or, in some cases, with oxymel:\r\nsome persons, too, swallow the rennet by itself, in the form of\r\npills. Castoreum[323] is sometimes administered, in three cyathi of\r\noxymel, to the patient fasting; but where the attacks are frequent,\r\nit is employed in the form of a clyster, with marvellous effect. The\r\nproper proportions, in this last case, are two drachmæ of castoreum,\r\none sextarius of oil and honey, and the same quantity of water. At\r\nthe moment that the patient is seized with a fit, it is a good plan\r\nto give him castoreum, with vinegar, to smell. The liver, too, of\r\nthe sea-weasel[324] is given to epileptic patients, or else that of\r\nsea-mice,[325] or the blood of tortoises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (10.)—REMEDIES FOR FEVERS. THE FISH CALLED ASELLUS: ONE\r\nREMEDY. THE PHAGRUS: ONE REMEDY. THE BALÆNA: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecurrent fevers are effectually checked by making the patient\r\ntaste the liver of a dolphin, just before the paroxysm comes on.\r\nHippocampi[326] are stifled in oil of roses, and the patients are\r\nrubbed therewith in cold agues, the fish, also, being worn as an amulet\r\nby the patient. In the same way, too, the small stones that are found\r\nat full moon in the head of the fish called “asellus”[327] are worn,\r\nattached in a piece of linen cloth to the patient’s body. A similar\r\nvirtue is attributed to the longest tooth of the river-fish called\r\nphagrus,[328] attached to the patient with a hair, provided he does not\r\nsee the person who attaches it to him for five days. Frogs are boiled\r\nin oil in a spot where three roads meet, and, the flesh being first\r\nthrown away, the patients are rubbed with the decoction, by way of cure\r\nfor quartan fever. Some persons, again, suffocate frogs in oil, and,\r\nafter attaching them to the patient without his knowing it, anoint him\r\nwith the oil. The heart of a frog, worn as an amulet, modifies the\r\ncold chills in fevers; the same, too, with oil in which the intestines\r\nof frogs have been boiled. But the best remedy for quartan fevers, is\r\nto wear attached to the body either frogs from which the claws have\r\nbeen[329] removed, or else the liver or heart of a bramble-frog,[330]\r\nattached in a piece of russet-coloured cloth.\r\n\r\nRiver-crabs,[331] bruised in oil and water, are highly beneficial in\r\nfevers, the patient being anointed with the preparation just before\r\nthe paroxysms come on: some authorities recommend the addition of\r\npepper to the mixture. Others prescribe for quartan fevers a decoction\r\nof river-crabs in wine, boiled down to one fourth, the patient taking\r\nit at the moment of leaving the bath: by some, too, it is recommended\r\nto swallow the left eye of a river-crab. The magicians engage to\r\ncure a tertian fever, by attaching as an amulet to the patient,\r\nbefore sunrise, the eyes of river-crabs, the crabs when thus blinded\r\nbeing set at liberty in the water. They say, too, that these eyes,\r\nattached to the body in a piece of deer’s hide, with the flesh of a\r\nnightingale,[332] will dispel sleep and promote watchfulness. In cases\r\nwhere there are symptoms of lethargy, the rennet of the balæna[333] or\r\nof the sea-calf[334] is given to the patient to smell; some persons,\r\ntoo, use the blood of tortoises as a liniment for lethargic patients.\r\n\r\nTertian fevers, it is said, may be cured by wearing one of the\r\nvertebræ[335] of a perch attached to the body, and quartan fevers by\r\nusing fresh river snails, as an aliment. Some persons preserve these\r\nsnails in salt for this purpose, and give them, pounded, in drink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—REMEDIES FOR LETHARGY, CACHEXY, AND DROPSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrombi,[336] left to putrefy in vinegar, act as an excitant upon\r\nlethargic patients by their smell; they are very useful, too, for the\r\ncure of cardiac diseases. For cachectic patients, where the body is\r\nwasting with consumption, tetheæ[337] are considered beneficial, mixed\r\nwith rue and honey. For the cure of dropsy, dolphin’s fat is melted and\r\ntaken with wine, the repulsive taste of it being neutralized by first\r\ntouching the nostrils with unguent or some other odoriferous substance,\r\nor else by plugging the nostrils in some way or other. The flesh of\r\nstrombi, pounded and given in three heminæ of honied wine and the same\r\nquantity of water, or, if there is fever, in hydromel, is very useful\r\nfor dropsy: the same, too, with the juice of river-crabs, administered\r\nwith honey. Water frogs, too, are boiled with old wine and spelt,[338]\r\nand taken as food, the liquor in which they have been boiled being\r\ndrunk from the same vessel: or else the feet, head, and tail of a\r\ntortoise are cut off, and the intestines removed, the rest of the flesh\r\nbeing seasoned in such a manner as to allow of its being taken without\r\nloathing. River-crabs, too, eaten with their broth, are said to be very\r\ngood for the cure of phthisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—REMEDIES FOR BURNS AND FOR ERYSIPELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurns are cured by applying ashes of calcined sea-crabs or river-crabs\r\nwith oil: fish-glue, too, and calcined frogs are used as an application\r\nfor scalds produced by boiling water. The same treatment also restores\r\nthe hair, provided the ashes are those of river-crabs: it is generally\r\nthought, too, that the preparation should be applied with wax and\r\nbears’ grease. Ashes, too, of burnt beaver-skin are very useful for\r\nthese purposes. Live frogs act as a check upon erysipelas, the belly\r\nside being applied to the part affected: it is recommended, too, to\r\nattach them lengthwise by the hinder legs, so as to render them more\r\nbeneficial by reason of their increased respiration.[339] Heads, too,\r\nof salted siluri[340] are reduced to ashes and applied with vinegar.\r\n\r\nPrurigo and itch-scab, not only in man but in quadrupeds as well, are\r\nmost efficaciously treated with the liver of the pastinaca[341] boiled\r\nin oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—REMEDIES FOR DISEASES OF THE SINEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exterior callosity with which the flesh of purples is covered,\r\nbeaten up, unites the sinews, even when they have been severed\r\nasunder. It is a good plan, for patients suffering from tetanus,\r\nto take sea-calf’s rennet in wine, in doses of one obolus, as also\r\nfish-glue.[342] Persons affected with fits of trembling find much\r\nrelief from castoreum,[343] provided they are well anointed with oil.\r\nI find it stated that the surmullet,[344] used as an article of diet,\r\nacts injuriously upon the sinews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—METHODS OF ARRESTING HÆMORRHAGE AND OF LETTING BLOOD. THE\r\nPOLYP: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFish, used as an aliment, it is generally thought, make blood. The\r\npolyp,[345] bruised and applied, arrests hæmorrhage, it is thought: in\r\naddition to which we find stated the following particulars respecting\r\nit—that of itself it emits a sort of brine, in consequence of which,\r\nthere is no necessity to use any in cooking it—that it should always\r\nbe sliced with a reed—and that it is spoilt by using an iron knife,\r\nbecoming tainted thereby, owing to the antipathy[346] which naturally\r\nexists [between it and iron]. For the purpose also of arresting\r\nhæmorrhage, ashes of burnt frogs are applied topically, or else the\r\ndried blood of those animals. Some authorities recommend the frog to\r\nbe used, that is known by the Greeks as “calamites,”[347] from the\r\nfact that it lives among reeds[348] and shrubs; it is the smallest\r\nand greenest of all the frogs, and either the blood or the ashes\r\nof it are recommended to be employed. Others, again, prescribe, in\r\ncases of bleeding at the nostrils, an injection of the ashes of young\r\nwater-frogs, in the tadpole state, calcined in a new earthen vessel.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, again, in cases where it is required to let blood,\r\nthe kind of leech is used which is known among us by the name of\r\n“sanguisuga.[349]” Indeed, the action of these leeches is looked upon\r\nas pretty much the same as that of the cupping-glasses[350] used in\r\nmedicine, their effect being to relieve the body of superfluous blood,\r\nand to open the pores of the skin. Still, however, there is this\r\ninconvenience attending them—when they have been once applied, they\r\ncreate a necessity[351] for having recourse to the same treatment at\r\nabout the same period in every succeeding year. Many physicians have\r\nbeen of opinion also, that leeches may be successfully applied in cases\r\nof gout. When gorged, they fall off in consequence of losing their hold\r\nthrough the weight of the blood, but if not, they must be sprinkled\r\nwith salt[352] for the purpose.\r\n\r\nLeeches are apt, however, to leave their heads buried in the flesh;\r\nthe consequence of which is an incurable wound, which has caused death\r\nin many cases, that of Messalinus,[353] for example, a patrician of\r\nconsular rank, after an application of leeches to his knee. When this\r\nis the case, that which was intended as a remedy is turned into an\r\nactive poison;[354] a result which is to be apprehended in using the\r\nred leeches more particularly. Hence it is that when these last are\r\nemployed, it is the practice to snip them with a pair of scissors while\r\nsucking; the consequence of which is, that the blood oozes forth,\r\nthrough a siphon, as it were, and the head, gradually contracting as\r\nthe animal dies, is not left behind in the wound. There is a natural\r\nantipathy[355] existing between leeches and bugs, and hence it is that\r\nthe latter are killed by the aid of a fumigation made with leeches.\r\nAshes of beaver-skin burnt with tar, kneaded up with leek-juice, arrest\r\nbleeding at the nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—METHODS OF EXTRACTING FOREIGN BODIES FROM THE FLESH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo extract pointed weapons which have pierced the flesh, ashes of\r\ncalcined shells of the sæpia are used, as also of the purple, the meat\r\nof salted fish, bruised river-crabs, or flesh of the silurus[356] (a\r\nriver-fish that is found in other streams as well as the Nilus[357]),\r\napplied either fresh or salted. The ashes also of this fish, as\r\nwell as the fat, have the property of extracting pointed bodies,\r\nand the back-bone, in a calcined state, is used as a substitute for\r\nspodium.[358]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—REMEDIES FOR ULCERS, CARCINOMATA, AND CARBUNCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nUlcers of a serpiginous nature, as also the fleshy excrescences which\r\nmake their appearance in them, are kept in check by applying ashes\r\nof calcined heads of mænæ,[359] or else ashes of the silurus.[360]\r\nCarcinomata, too, are treated with heads of salted perch, their\r\nefficacy being considerably increased by using some salt along\r\nwith the ashes, and kneading them up with heads of cunila[361] and\r\nolive-oil. Ashes of sea-crabs, calcined with lead, arrest the progress\r\nof carcinomatous sores; a purpose for which ashes of river-crabs, in\r\ncombination with honey and fine lint, are equally useful: though there\r\nare some authorities which prefer mixing alum and barley with the\r\nashes. Phagedænic ulcers are cured by an application of dried silurus\r\npounded with sandarach;[362] malignant cancers, corrosive ulcers, and\r\nputrid sores, by the agency of stale cybium.[363]\r\n\r\nMaggots that breed in sores are removed by applying frogs’ gall; and\r\nfistulas are opened and dried by introducing a tent made of salt fish,\r\nwith a dossil of lint. Salt fish, kneaded up and applied in the form\r\nof a plaster, will remove all proud flesh in the course of a day, and\r\nwill arrest the further progress of putrid and serpiginous ulcers.\r\nAlex,[364] applied in lint, acts detergently, also, upon ulcers; the\r\nsame, too, with the ashes of calcined shells of sea-urchins. Salted\r\nslices of the coracinus[365] disperse carbuncles, an effect equally\r\nproduced by the ashes of salted surmullets.[366] Some persons, however,\r\nuse the head only of the surmullet, in combination with honey or\r\nwith the flesh of the coracinus. Ashes of the murex, applied with\r\noil, disperse tumours, and the gall of the sea-scorpion makes scars\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—REMEDIES FOR WARTS, AND FOR MALFORMED NAILS. THE GLANIS: ONE\r\nREMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo remove warts, the liver of the glanis[367] is applied to the part;\r\nashes also of heads of mæmæ[368] bruised with garlic—substances which\r\nshould be used raw where it is thyme-warts[369] that require to be\r\nremoved—the gall of the red sea-scorpion,[370] smarides[371] pounded\r\nand applied, or alex[372] thoroughly boiled. Ashes of calcined heads of\r\nmænæ[373] are used to rectify malformed nails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—REMEDIES FOR FEMALE DISEASES. THE GLAUCISCUS: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe milk is increased in females by eating the glauciscus[374] in its\r\nown liquor, or else smarides[375] with a ptisan, or boiled with fennel.\r\nAshes of calcined shells of the murex or purple, applied with honey,\r\nare an effectual cure for affections of the mamillæ; river-crabs,\r\ntoo, and sea-crabs, applied topically, are equally good. The meat\r\nof the murex, applied to the mamillæ, removes hairs[376] growing\r\nupon those parts. The squatina,[377] applied topically, prevents the\r\nmamillæ from becoming too distended. Lint greased with dolphin’s[378]\r\nfat, and then ignited, produces a smoke which acts as an excitant\r\nupon females suffering from hysterical suffocations; the same, too,\r\nwith strombi,[379] left to putrefy in vinegar. Heads of perch or\r\nof mænæ,[380] calcined and mixed with salt, oil, and cunila,[381]\r\nare curative of diseases of the uterus: used as a fumigation, they\r\nbring away the afterbirth. Fat,[382] too, of the sea-calf, melted by\r\nthe agency of fire, is introduced into the nostrils of females when\r\nswooning from hysterical suffocations; and for a similar purpose, the\r\nrennet of that animal is applied as a pessary, in wool.\r\n\r\nThe pulmo marinus,[383] attached to the body as an amulet, is an\r\nexcellent promoter of menstruation; an effect which is equally\r\nproduced by pounding live sea-urchins, and taking them in sweet wine.\r\nRiver-crabs,[384] bruised in wine, and taken internally, arrest\r\nmenstruation. The silurus,[385] that of Africa[386] more particularly,\r\nused as a fumigation, facilitates parturition, it is said. Crabs, taken\r\nin water, arrest menstruation; but used with hyssop, they act as an\r\nemmenagogue, we are told. In cases, too, where the infant is in danger\r\nof suffocation at the moment of delivery, a similar drink, administered\r\nto the mother, is highly efficacious. Crabs, too, either fresh or\r\ndried, are taken in drink, for the purpose of preventing abortion.\r\nHippocrates[387] prescribes them as a promoter of menstruation, and\r\nas an expellent of the dead fœtus, beaten up with five[388] roots of\r\nlapathum and rue and some soot, and administered in honied wine. Crabs,\r\nboiled and taken in their liquor, with lapathum[389] and parsley,\r\npromote the menstrual discharge, and increase the milk. In cases of\r\nfever, attended with pains in the head and throbbing of the eyes, crabs\r\nare said to be highly beneficial to females, given in astringent wine.\r\n\r\nCastoreum,[390] taken in honied wine, is useful as a promoter of\r\nmenstruation: in cases of hysterical suffocation, it is given to the\r\npatient to smell at with pitch and vinegar, or else it is made up into\r\ntablets and used as a pessary. For the purpose also of bringing away\r\nthe afterbirth it is found a useful plan to employ castoreum with\r\npanax,[391] in four cyathi of wine; and in cases where the patient is\r\nsuffering from cold, in doses of three oboli. If, however, a female in\r\na state of pregnancy should happen to step over castoreum, or over the\r\nbeaver itself, abortion, it is said, will be the sure result: so, too,\r\nif castoreum is only held over a pregnant woman’s head, there will be\r\ngreat danger of miscarriage.\r\n\r\nThere is a very marvellous fact, too, that I find stated in reference\r\nto the torpedo:[392] if it is caught at the time that the moon is\r\nin Libra, and kept in the open air for three days, it will always\r\nfacilitate parturition, as often as it is introduced into the apartment\r\nof a woman in labour. The sting, too, of the pastinaca,[393] attached\r\nto the navel, is generally thought to have the property of facilitating\r\ndelivery: it must be taken, however, from the fish while alive; which\r\ndone, the fish must be returned to the sea. I find it stated by some\r\nauthorities that there is a substance called “ostraceum,” which is also\r\nspoken of as “onyx”[394] by others; that, used as a fumigation, it is\r\nwonderfully beneficial for suffocations of the uterus; that in smell it\r\nresembles castoreum, and is still more efficacious, if burnt with this\r\nlast substance; and that in a calcined state it has the property of\r\nhealing inveterate ulcers, and cancerous sores of a malignant nature.\r\nAs to carbuncles and carcinomatous sores upon the secret parts of\r\nfemales, there is nothing more efficacious, it is said, than a female\r\ncrab beaten up, just after full moon, with flower of salt[395] and\r\napplied with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—METHODS OF REMOVING SUPERFLUOUS HAIR. DEPILATORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepilatories are prepared from the blood, gall, and liver of the tunny,\r\neither fresh or preserved; as also from pounded liver of the same fish,\r\npreserved with cedar resin[396] in a leaden box; a recipe which we\r\nfind given by the midwife Salpe[397] for disguising the age of boys on\r\nsale for slaves. A similar property belongs to the pulmo marinus,[398]\r\nto the blood and gall of the sea-hare, and to the sea-hare itself,\r\nstifled in oil. The same, too, with ashes of burnt crabs or sea\r\nscolopendræ,[399] mixed with oil; sea-nettles,[400] bruised in squill\r\nvinegar; and brains of the torpedo[401] applied with alum on the\r\nsixteenth day of the moon. The thick matter emitted by the small frogs,\r\nwhich we have described when treating[402] of eye-diseases, is a most\r\nefficient depilatory, if applied fresh: the same, too, with the frog\r\nitself, dried and pounded, and then boiled down to one-third in three\r\nheminæ of water, or else boiled in a copper vessel with oil in a like\r\nproportion. Others, again, prepare a depilatory from fifteen frogs, in\r\nmanner already[403] stated under the head of remedies for the eyes.\r\nLeeches, also, grilled in an earthen vessel, and applied with vinegar,\r\nhave the same property as a depilatory; the very odour, too, which\r\nattaches to the persons who thus burn them is singularly efficacious\r\nfor killing bugs.[404] Cases are to be found, too, where persons have\r\nused castoreum with honey, for many days together, as a depilatory.\r\nIn the case, however, of every depilatory, the hairs should always be\r\nremoved before it is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF INFANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDentition in infants is promoted, and the gums greatly relieved, by\r\nrubbing them with ashes of a dolphin’s teeth, mixed with honey, or\r\nelse by touching the gums with the tooth itself of that fish. One of\r\nthese teeth, worn as an amulet, is a preventive of sudden frights;[405]\r\nthe tooth of the dog-fish[406] being also possessed of a similar\r\nproperty. As to ulcers which make their appearance in the ears, or in\r\nany other parts of the body, they may be cured by applying the liquor\r\nof river-crabs,[407] with barley-meal. These crabs, too, bruised in\r\noil and employed as a friction, are very useful for other kinds of\r\nmaladies. A sponge moistened with cold water from time to time,[408]\r\nor a frog applied, the back part to the head, is a most efficacious\r\ncure for siriasis[409] in infants. When the frog is removed, it will be\r\nfound quite dry, they say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—METHODS OF PREVENTING INTOXICATION. THE FISH CALLED RUBELLIO:\r\nONE REMEDY. THE EEL: ONE REMEDY. THE GRAPE-FISH: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA surmullet[410] stifled in wine; the fish called “rubellio;”[411] or a\r\ncouple of eels similarly treated; or a grapefish,[412] left to putrefy\r\nin wine, all of them, produce an aversion to wine in those who drink\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—ANTAPHRODISIACS AND APHRODISIACS. THE HIPPOPOTAMUS: ONE\r\nREMEDY. THE CROCODILE: ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the number of antaphrodisiacs, we have the echeneïs;[413] the skin\r\nfrom the left side of the forehead of the hippopotamus,[414] attached\r\nto the body in lamb-skin; and the gall of a live torpedo,[415] applied\r\nto the generative organs.\r\n\r\nThe following substances act as aphrodisiacs—the flesh of river-snails,\r\npreserved in salt and given to drink in wine; the erythinus[416] taken\r\nas food; the liver of the frog called “diopetes” or “calamites”[417]\r\nattached to the body in a small piece of crane’s skin; the eye-tooth\r\nof a crocodile, attached to the arm; the hippocampus;[418] and the\r\nsinews of a bramble-frog,[419] worn as an amulet upon the right arm.\r\nA bramble-frog, attached to the body in a piece of fresh sheep-skin,\r\neffectually puts an end to love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—REMEDIES FOR THE DISEASES OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA decoction of frogs in water, reduced to the form of a liniment, is\r\ncurative of itch-scab in horses; indeed, it is said, that a horse, when\r\nonce treated in this manner, will never again be attacked with the\r\ndisease. Salpe says that if a live frog is given to dogs in their mess,\r\nthey will lose the power of barking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—OTHER AQUATIC PRODUCTIONS. ADARCA OR CALAMOCHNOS: THREE\r\nREMEDIES. REEDS: EIGHT REMEDIES. THE INK OF THE SÆPIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the aquatic productions ought also to be mentioned calamochnos,\r\nin Latin known as “adarca,”[420] a substance which collects about\r\nsmall reeds, from a mixture of the foam of fresh and of sea water.\r\nIt possesses certain caustic properties, and hence it is that it is\r\nso useful as an ingredient in “acopa”[421] and as a remedy for cold\r\nshiverings; it is used too, for removing freckles upon the face of\r\nfemales. And now we are speaking of adarca, the reed ought equally to\r\nbe mentioned. The root of that known as the “phragmites,”[422] pounded\r\nfresh, is curative of sprains, and, applied topically with vinegar,\r\nremoves pains in the spine. The calcined bark, too, of the Cyprian[423]\r\nreed, known as the “donax,” is curative of alopecy and inveterate\r\nulcers; and its leaves are good for the extraction of foreign bodies\r\nadhering to the flesh, and for the cure of erysipelas: should, however,\r\nthe flower of the panicle happen to enter the ears, deafness[424] is\r\nthe consequence.\r\n\r\nThe ink of the sæpia[425] is possessed of such remarkable potency,\r\nthat if it is put into a lamp, Anaxilaüs tells us, the light will\r\nbecome entirely changed,[426] and all present will look as black as\r\nÆthiopians. The bramble-frog, boiled in water, and given to swine with\r\ntheir drink, is curative of the maladies with which they are affected;\r\nan effect equally produced by the ashes of any other kind of frog.\r\nIf wood is rubbed with the pulmo marinus,[427] it will have all the\r\nappearance of being on fire; so much so, indeed, that a walking-stick,\r\nthus treated, will light the way like a torch.[428]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53. (11.)—THE NAMES OF ALL THE ANIMALS THAT EXIST IN THE SEA, ONE\r\nHUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SIX IN NUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now completed our exposition of the properties which belong to\r\nthe aquatic productions, it would appear by no means foreign to my\r\npurpose to give a list of the various animated beings which inhabit\r\nthe seas; so many as these are in number, of such vast extent, and not\r\nonly making their way into the interior of the land to a distance of so\r\nmany miles, but also surrounding the exterior of it to an extent almost\r\nequal to that of the world itself. These animals, it is generally\r\nconsidered, embrace one hundred and seventy-six different[429] species,\r\nand it will be my object to set them forth, each by its distinct name,\r\na thing that cannot possibly be done in reference to the terrestrial\r\nanimals and the birds.\r\n\r\nFor, in fact, we are by no means acquainted with all the wild beasts\r\nor all the birds that are to be found in India, Æthiopia, Scythia, or\r\nthe desert regions of the earth; and even of man himself there are\r\nnumerous varieties, which as yet we have been unable[430] to make\r\nourselves acquainted with. In addition, too, to the various countries\r\nabove mentioned, we have Taprobane[431] and other isles of the Ocean,\r\nabout which so many fabulous stories are related. Surely then, every\r\none must allow that it is quite impossible to comprise every species\r\nof animal in one general view for the information of mankind. And yet,\r\nby Hercules! in the sea and in the Ocean, vast as it is, there exists\r\nnothing that is unknown to us,[432] and, a truly marvellous fact, it is\r\nwith those things which Nature has concealed in the deep that we are\r\nthe best acquainted!\r\n\r\nTo begin then with the monsters[433] that are found in this\r\nelement. We here find sea-trees,[434] physeters,[435] balænæ,[436]\r\npistrices,[437] tritons,[438] nereids,[439] elephants,[440] the\r\ncreatures known as sea-men,[441] sea-wheels,[442] orcæ,[443]\r\nsea-rams,[444] musculi,[445] other fish too with the form of rams,[446]\r\ndolphins,[447] sea-calves,[448] so celebrated by Homer,[449]\r\ntortoises[450] to minister to our luxury, and beavers, so extensively\r\nemployed in medicine,[451] to which class belongs the otter,[452] an\r\nanimal which we nowhere find frequenting the sea, it being only of\r\nthe marine animals that we are speaking. There are dog-fish,[453]\r\nalso, drinones,[454] cornutæ,[455] swordfish,[456] saw-fish,[457]\r\nhippopotami[458] and crocodiles,[459] common to the sea, the land, and\r\nthe rivers; tunnies[460] also, thynnides, siluri,[461] coracini,[462]\r\nand perch,[463] common to the sea only and to rivers.\r\n\r\nTo the sea only, belong also the acipenser,[464] the dorade,[465]\r\nthe asellus,[466] the acharne,[467] the aphye,[468] the alopex,[469]\r\nthe eel,[470] the araneus,[471] the boca,[472] the batia,[473] the\r\nbacchus,[474] the batrachus,[475] the belonæ,[476] known to us as\r\n“aculeati,”[477] the balanus,[478] the corvus,[479] the citharus, the\r\nleast esteemed of all the turbots, the chalcis,[480] the cobio,[481]\r\nthe callarias,[482] which would belong to the genus of the aselli[483]\r\nwere it not smaller; the colias,[484] otherwise known as the fish of\r\nParium[485] or of Sexita,[486] this last from a place of that name\r\nin Bætica its native region, the smallest, too, of the lacerti;[487]\r\nthe colias of the Mæotis, the next smallest of the lacerti; the\r\ncybium,[488] (the name given, when cut into pieces, to the pelamis[489]\r\nwhich returns at the end of forty days from the Euxine to the Palus\r\nMæotis); the cordyla[490]—which is also a small pelamis, so called\r\nat the time when it enters the Euxine from the Palus Mæotis—the\r\ncantharus,[491] the callionymus[492] or uranoscopus, the cinædus, the\r\nonly[493] fish that is of a yellow colour; the cnide, known to us as\r\nthe sea-nettle;[494] the different kinds of crabs,[495] the striated\r\nchemæ,[496] the smooth chemæ, the chemæ belonging to the genus of\r\npelorides,[497] all differing in the variety of their colours and\r\nin the roundness of the shells; the chemæ glycymarides,[498] still\r\nlarger than the pelorides; the coluthia or coryphia;[499] the various\r\nkinds of shellfish, among which we find the pearl oysters,[500] the\r\ncochleæ,[501] (belonging to which class are the pentadactyli,[502]) the\r\nhelices,[503] by some known as actinophori, the spokes[504] on whose\r\nshells are used for musical purposes;[505] and, in addition to these,\r\nthe round cochleæ, the shells of which are used in measuring oil, as\r\nalso the sea-cucumber,[506] the cynopos,[507] the cammarus,[508] and\r\nthe cynosdexia.[509]\r\n\r\nNext to these we have the sea-dragon,[510] a fish which, according\r\nto some, is altogether distinct from the dracunculus,[511] and\r\nresembles the gerricula in appearance, it having on the gills a\r\nstickle which points towards the tail and inflicts a wound like that\r\nof the scorpion[512] when the fish is handled—the erythinus,[513] the\r\necheneïs,[514] the sea-urchin,[515] the sea-elephant, a black kind of\r\ncrayfish, with four forked legs, in addition to two arms with double\r\njoints, and furnished, each of them, with a pair of claws, indented\r\nat the edge; the faber,[516] also, or zæus, the glauciscus,[517] the\r\nglanis,[518] the gonger,[519] the gerres,[520] the galeos,[521] the\r\ngaros,[522] the hippos,[523] the hippuros,[524] the hirundo,[525]\r\nthe halipleumon,[526] the hippocampus,[527] the hepar,[528] the\r\nictinus[529] and the iulis.[530] There are various kinds also of\r\nlacerti,[531] the springing loligo,[532] the crayfish,[533] the\r\nlantern-fish,[534] the lepas,[535] the larinus, the sea-hare,[536] and\r\nthe sea-lion,[537] with arms like those of the crab, and in the other\r\nparts of the body like the cray-fish.\r\n\r\nWe have the surmullet[538] also, the sea black-bird,[539] highly\r\nesteemed among the rock-fish; the mullet,[540] the melanurus,[541]\r\nthe mæna,[542] the mæotis,[543] the muræna,[544] the mys,[545] the\r\nmitulus,[546] the myiscus,[547] the murex,[548] the oculata,[549] the\r\nophidion,[550] the oyster,[551] the otia,[552] the orcynus—the largest\r\nof all the pelamides[553] and one that never returns to the Palus\r\nMæotis, like the tritomus[554] in appearance, and best when old—the\r\norbis,[555] the orthagoriscus,[556] the phager,[557] the phycis[558]\r\na rock-fish, the pelamis,[559] (the largest kind of which is called\r\n“apolectum,”[560] and is tougher than the tritomus) the sea-pig,[561]\r\nthe phthir,[562] the sea-sparrow,[563] the pastinaca,[564] the several\r\nvarieties of the polyp,[565] the scallop,[566] which is larger and more\r\nswarthy in summer than at other times, and the most esteemed of which\r\nare those of Mitylene,[567] Tyndaris,[568] Salonæ,[569] Altinum,[570]\r\nthe island of Chios, and Alexandria in Egypt; the small scallop,[571]\r\nthe purple,[572] the pegris,[573] the pinna,[574] the pinnotheres,[575]\r\nthe rhine[576] or squalus of the Latins, the turbot,[577] the\r\nscarus,[578] a fish which holds the first rank at the present day;\r\nthe sole,[579] the sargus,[580] the squilla,[581] the sarda[582]—such\r\nbeing the name of an elongated pelamis[583] which comes from the Ocean;\r\nthe scomber,[584] the salpa,[585] the sorus,[586] the scorpæna,[587]\r\nthe sea-scorpion,[588] the solas,[589] the sciæna,[590] the\r\nsciadeus,[591] the scolopendra,[592] the smyrus,[593] the sæpia,[594]\r\nthe strombus,[595] the solen,[596] otherwise known as the aulos,\r\ndonax, onyx or dactylus; the spondylus,[597] the smaris,[598] the\r\nstarfish,[599] and the sponges.[600] There is the sea-thrush[601] also,\r\nfamous among the rock-fish, the thynnis,[602] the thranis, by some\r\nwriters known as the xiphias;[603] the thrissa,[604] the torpedo,[605]\r\nthe tethea,[606] the tritomus, a large kind of pelamis,[607] which\r\nadmits of being cut into three cybia;[608] the shells of Venus,[609]\r\nthe grape-fish,[610] and the xiphias.[611]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—ADDITIONAL NAMES OF FISHES FOUND IN THE POEM OF OVID.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the above enumeration we will add some names given in the poem of\r\nOvid,[612] which are not to be found in any other writer: species,\r\nhowever, which are probably peculiar to the Euxine, on the shores[613]\r\nof which he commenced that work towards the close of his life. The\r\nfishes thus mentioned by him are the sea-ox, the cercyrus, that\r\ndwells among the rocks, the orphus,[614] the red erythinus,[615] the\r\niulus,[616] the tinted mormyr, the chrysophrys[617] a fish of a golden\r\ncolour, the parus,[618] the tragus,[619] the melanurus[620] remarkable\r\nfor the beauty of its tail, and the epodes,[621] a flat fish.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these remarkable kinds of fishes, the same poet tells\r\nus that the channes[622] conceives of itself, that the glaucus[623]\r\nnever makes its appearance in summer, that the pompilus[624] always\r\naccompanies vessels in their course, and that the chromis[625] makes\r\nits nest in the water. The helops, he says, is unknown to our waters;\r\nfrom which it would appear that those are in error who look upon it\r\nas identical with our acipenser.[626] Many persons have given the\r\npreference to the helops before all other fish, in point of flavour.\r\n\r\nThere are several fishes also, which have been mentioned by no author;\r\nsuch, for instance, as the one called “sudis” by the Latins, and\r\n“sphyrene” by the Greeks, names which indicate the peculiar form of its\r\nmuzzle.[627] It is one of the very largest kinds, but rarely found,\r\nand by no means of inferior flavour. “Perna,” too, is the name given\r\nto a kind of shell-fish, found in vast numbers in the vicinity of the\r\nislands of the Euxine. These fish are found firmly planted in the sand,\r\nresembling in appearance the long shank[628] of a hog. Opening wide\r\ntheir shells, where there is sufficient space, they lie in wait for\r\ntheir prey; this opening being not less than a foot in breadth, and the\r\nedges of it garnished around with teeth closely set, much resembling\r\nthe teeth of a comb in form. Within the shell, the meat consists of a\r\nvast lump of flesh. I once saw, too, a fish called the “hyæna,”[629]\r\nwhich had been caught off the island of Ænaria.[630]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these animals, there are certain excretions thrown up\r\nby the sea, which do not merit any further notice, and indeed ought to\r\nbe reckoned among the sea-weeds, rather than looked upon as animated\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine hundred and\r\nninety.\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Licinius Macer,[631] Trebius Niger,[632] Sextius\r\nNiger[633] who wrote in Greek, the Poet Ovid,[634] Cassius Hemina,[635]\r\nMæcenas,[636] Iacchus,[637] Sornatius.[638]\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Juba,[639] Andreas,[640] Salpe,[641]\r\nApion,[642] Pelops,[643] Apelles,[644] Thrasyllus,[645] Nicander.[646]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF METALS.[647]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 1. (1.)—METALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now about to speak of metals, of actual wealth,[648] the\r\nstandard of comparative value, objects for which we diligently search,\r\nwithin the earth, in numerous ways. In one place, for instance, we\r\nundermine it for the purpose of obtaining riches, to supply the\r\nexigencies of life, searching for either gold or silver, electrum[649]\r\nor copper.[650] In another place, to satisfy the requirements of\r\nluxury, our researches extend to gems and pigments, with which to adorn\r\nour fingers[651] and the walls of our houses: while in a third place,\r\nwe gratify our rash propensities by a search for iron, which, amid wars\r\nand carnage, is deemed more acceptable even than gold. We trace out\r\nall the veins of the earth, and yet, living upon it, undermined as it\r\nis beneath our feet, are astonished that it should occasionally cleave\r\nasunder or tremble: as though, forsooth, these signs could be any\r\nother than expressions of the indignation felt by our sacred parent!\r\nWe penetrate into her entrails, and seek for treasures in the abodes\r\neven of the Manes,[652] as though each spot we tread upon were not\r\nsufficiently bounteous and fertile for us!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, amid all this, we are far from making remedies the object of\r\nour researches: and how few in thus delving into the earth have in\r\nview the promotion of medicinal knowledge! For it is upon her surface,\r\nin fact, that she has presented us with these substances, equally\r\nwith the cereals, bounteous and ever ready, as she is, in supplying\r\nus with all things for our benefit! It is what is concealed from our\r\nview, what is sunk far beneath her surface, objects, in fact, of no\r\nrapid formation,[653] that urge us to our ruin, that send us to the\r\nvery depths of hell. As the mind ranges in vague speculation, let us\r\nonly consider, proceeding through all ages, as these operations are,\r\nwhen will be the end of thus exhausting the earth, and to what point\r\nwill avarice finally penetrate! How innocent, how happy, how truly\r\ndelightful even would life be, if we were to desire nothing but what is\r\nto be found upon the face of the earth; in a word, nothing but what is\r\nprovided ready to our hands!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold is dug out of the earth, and, in close proximity to it,\r\nchrysocolla,[654] a substance which, that it may appear all the more\r\nprecious, still retains the name[655] which it has borrowed from\r\ngold.[656] It was not enough for us to have discovered one bane for\r\nthe human race, but we must set a value too upon the very humours\r\nof gold.[657] While avarice, too, was on the search for silver, it\r\ncongratulated itself upon the discovery of minium,[658] and devised a\r\nuse to be made of this red earth.\r\n\r\nAlas for the prodigal inventions of man! in how many ways have we\r\naugmented the value of things![659] In addition to the standard value\r\nof these metals, the art of painting lends its aid, and we have\r\nrendered gold and silver still more costly by the art of chasing them.\r\nMan has learned how to challenge both Nature and art to become the\r\nincitements to vice! His very cups he has delighted to engrave with\r\nlibidinous subjects, and he takes pleasure in drinking from vessels\r\nof obscene form![660] But in lapse of time, the metals passed out of\r\nfashion, and men began to make no account of them; gold and silver, in\r\nfact, became too common. From this same earth we have extracted vessels\r\nof murrhine[661] and vases of crystal,[662] objects the very fragility\r\nof which is considered to enhance their value. In fact, it has come\r\nto be looked upon as a proof of opulence, and as quite the glory of\r\nluxury, to possess that which may be irremediably destroyed in an\r\ninstant. Nor was even this enough;—we now drink from out of a mass of\r\ngems,[663] and we set our goblets with smaragdi;[664] we take delight\r\nin possessing the wealth of India, as the promoter of intoxication, and\r\ngold is now nothing more than a mere accessory.[665]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—WHAT WAS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION OF GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould that gold could have been banished for ever from the earth,\r\naccursed by universal report,[666] as some of the most celebrated\r\nwriters have expressed themselves, reviled by the reproaches of the\r\nbest of men, and looked upon as discovered only for the ruin of\r\nmankind. How much more happy the age when things themselves were\r\nbartered for one another; as was the case in the times of the Trojan\r\nwar, if we are to believe what Homer says. For, in this way, in my\r\nopinion, was commerce then carried on for the supply of the necessaries\r\nof life. Some, he tells us, would make their purchases by bartering\r\nox-hides, and others by bartering iron or the spoil which they had\r\ntaken from the enemy:[667] and yet he himself, already an admirer of\r\ngold, was so far aware of the relative value of things, that Glaucus,\r\nhe informs us, exchanged his arms of gold, valued at one hundred oxen,\r\nfor those of Diomedes, which were worth but nine.[668] Proceeding upon\r\nthe same system of barter, many of the fines imposed by ancient laws,\r\nat Rome even, were levied in cattle,[669] [and not in money].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE ORIGIN OF GOLD RINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe worst crime against mankind was committed by him who was the\r\nfirst to put a ring upon his fingers: and yet we are not informed, by\r\ntradition, who it was that first did so. For as to all the stories told\r\nabout Prometheus, I look upon them as utterly fabulous, although I am\r\naware that the ancients used to represent him with a ring of iron: it\r\nwas their intention, however, to signify a chain thereby, and not an\r\nornament. As to the ring of Midas,[670] which, upon the collet being\r\nturned inwards, conferred invisibility upon the wearer, who is there\r\nthat must not admit, perforce, that this story is even still more\r\nfabulous? It was the hand, and a sinister[671] hand, too, in every\r\nsense, that first brought gold into such high repute: not a Roman hand,\r\nhowever, for upon that it was the practice to wear a ring of iron only,\r\nand solely as an indication of warlike prowess.\r\n\r\nAs to the usage followed by the Roman kings, it is not easy to\r\npronounce an opinion: the statue of Romulus in the Capitol wears no\r\nring, nor does any other statue—not that of L. Brutus even—with the\r\nsole exception of those of Numa and Servius Tullius. I am surprised\r\nat this absence of the ring, in the case of the Tarquinii more\r\nparticularly, seeing that they were originally from Greece,[672] a\r\ncountry from which the use of gold rings was first introduced; though\r\neven at the present day the people of Lacedæmon are in the habit of\r\nwearing rings made of iron. Tarquinius Priscus, however, it is well\r\nknown, was the first who presented his son with the golden bulla,[673]\r\non the occasion of his slaying an enemy before he had laid aside the\r\nprætexta;[674] from which period the custom of wearing the bulla has\r\nbeen continued, a distinction confined to the children of those who\r\nhave served in the cavalry, those of other persons simply wearing a\r\nleather thong.[675] Such being the case, I am the more surprised that\r\nthe statue of this Tarquinius should be without a ring.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, with reference to the very name of the ring, I find that there\r\nhas been considerable uncertainty. That given to it originally by the\r\nGreeks is derived from the finger;[676] while our ancestors styled it\r\n“ungulus;”[677] and in later times both Greeks and Latins have given\r\nit the name of “symbolum.”[678] For a great length of time, it is\r\nquite clear, not even the Roman senators wore rings of gold: for rings\r\nwere given, and at the public expense, to those only who were about to\r\nproceed on an embassy to foreign nations, the reason being, I suppose,\r\nbecause men of highest rank among foreign nations were perceived to\r\nbe thus distinguished. Nor was it the practice for any person to wear\r\nthese rings, except those who for this reason had received them at the\r\npublic expense; and in most instances, it was without this distinction\r\nthat the Roman generals celebrated their public triumphs.[679] For\r\nwhereas an Etruscan crown[680] of gold was supported from behind over\r\nthe head of the victor, he himself, equally with the slave probably,\r\nwho was so supporting the crown, had nothing but a ring of iron upon\r\nhis finger.[681] It was in this manner that C. Marius celebrated his\r\ntriumph over Jugurtha; and he never assumed[682] the golden ring, it\r\nis said, until the period of his third consulship.[683] Those, too,\r\nwho had received golden rings on the occasion of an embassy, only wore\r\nthem when in public, resuming the ring of iron when in their houses. It\r\nis in pursuance of this custom that even at the present day, an iron\r\nring[684] is sent by way of present to a woman when betrothed, and\r\nthat, too, without any stone in it.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I do not find that any rings were used in the days of\r\nthe Trojan War; at all events, Homer nowhere makes mention of them;\r\nfor although he speaks of the practice of sending tablets[685] by way\r\nof letter,[686] of clothes and gold and silver plate being kept laid\r\nup in chests,[687] still he gives us to understand that they were kept\r\nsecure by the aid of a knot tied fast, and not under a seal impressed\r\nby a ring. He does not inform us too, that when the chiefs drew lots\r\nto ascertain which one of them should reply to the challenge[688] of\r\nthe enemy, they made any use of rings[689] for the purpose; and when\r\nhe enumerates the articles that were manufactured at the forge[690] of\r\nthe gods, he speaks of this as being the origin[691] of fibulæ[692] and\r\nother articles of female ornament, such as ear-rings for example, but\r\ndoes not make any mention of rings. [693] Whoever it was that first\r\nintroduced the use of rings, he did so not without hesitation; for he\r\nplaced this ornament on the left hand, the hand which is generally\r\nconcealed,[694] whereas, if he had been sure of its being an honourable\r\ndistinction, it would have been made more conspicuous upon the right.\r\nAnd if any one should raise the objection that this would have acted\r\nas an impediment to the right hand, I can only say that the usage in\r\nmore recent times fortifies my opinion, and that the inconvenience of\r\nwearing rings on the left hand would have been still greater, seeing\r\nthat it is with the left hand that the shield is held. We find mention\r\nmade too, in Homer,[695] of men wearing gold plaited with the hair;\r\nand hence it is that I am at a loss to say whether the practice first\r\noriginated with females.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—THE QUANTITY OF GOLD POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Rome, for a long period of time, the quantity of gold was but very\r\nsmall. At all events, after the capture of the City by the Gauls, when\r\npeace was about to be purchased, not more than one thousand pounds’\r\nweight of gold could be collected. I am by no means unaware of the\r\nfact that in the third[696] consulship of Pompeius there was lost from\r\nthe throne of Jupiter Capitolinus two thousand pounds’ weight of gold,\r\noriginally placed there by Camillus; a circumstance which has led most\r\npersons to suppose, that two thousand pounds’ weight was the quantity\r\nthen collected. But in reality, this excess of one thousand pounds was\r\ncontributed from the spoil taken from the Gauls, amplified as it was by\r\nthe gold of which they had stripped the temples, in that part of the\r\nCity which they had captured.\r\n\r\nThe story of Torquatus,[697] too, is a proof that the Gauls were in the\r\nhabit of wearing ornaments of gold when engaged in combat;[698] from\r\nwhich it would appear that the sum taken from the Gauls themselves, and\r\nthe amount of which they had pillaged the temples, were only equal to\r\nthe amount of gold collected for the ransom, and no more; and this is\r\nwhat was really meant by the response given by the augurs, that Jupiter\r\nCapitolinus had rendered again the ransom twofold.[699] As we were\r\njust now speaking on the subject of rings, it may be as well to add,\r\nby way of passing remark, that upon the officer[700] in charge of the\r\nTemple of Jupiter Capitolinus being arrested, he broke the stone of his\r\nring between his teeth,[701] and expired upon the spot, thus putting an\r\nend to all possibility of discovering the perpetrator of the theft.\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that in the year of the City 364, when Rome was\r\ncaptured by the Gauls, there was but two thousand pounds’ weight of\r\ngold, at the very most; and this, too, at a period when, according to\r\nthe returns of the census, there were already one hundred and fifty-two\r\nthousand five hundred and seventy-three free citizens in it. In this\r\nsame city, too, three hundred and seven years later, the gold which\r\nC. Marius the younger[702] conveyed to Præsneste from the Temple of\r\nthe Capitol when in flames, and all the other shrines, amounted to\r\nthirteen thousand pounds’ weight, such being the sum that figured in\r\nthe inscriptions at the triumph of Sylla; on which occasion it was\r\ndisplayed in the procession, as well as six thousand pounds’ weight of\r\nsilver. The same Sylla had, the day before, displayed in his triumph\r\nfifteen thousand pounds’ weight of gold, and one hundred and fifteen\r\nthousand pounds’ weight of silver, the fruit of all his other victories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—THE RIGHT OF WEARING GOLD RINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that rings were in common use before the time of\r\nCneius Flavius, the son of Annius. This Flavius was the first to\r\npublish a table[703] of the days for pleading,[704] which till then the\r\npopulace had to ascertain each day from a few great personages.[705]\r\nThe son of a freedman only, and secretary to Appius Cæcus,[706] (at\r\nwhose request, by dint of natural shrewdness and continual observation,\r\nhe had selected these days and made them public),[707] he obtained\r\nsuch high favour with the people, that he was created curule ædile; in\r\nconjunction with Quintus Anicius Prænestinus, who a few years before\r\nhad been an enemy to Rome,[708] and to the exclusion of C. Pœtilius and\r\nDomitius, whose fathers respectively were of consular rank.[709] The\r\nadditional honour was also conferred on Flavius, of making him tribune\r\nof the people at the same time, a thing which occasioned such a degree\r\nof indignation, that, as we find stated in the more ancient Annals,\r\n“the rings[710] were laid aside!”\r\n\r\nMost persons, however, are mistaken in the supposition that on this\r\noccasion the members of the equestrian order did the same: for it is\r\nin consequence of these additional words, “the phaleræ,[711] too,\r\nwere laid aside as well,” that the name of the equestrian order was\r\nadded. These rings, too, as the Annals tell us, were laid aside by the\r\nnobility, and not[712] by the whole body of the senate. This event\r\ntook place in the consulship of P. Sempronius and P. Sulpicius.[713]\r\nFlavius made a vow that he would consecrate a temple to Concord,\r\nif he should succeed in reconciling the privileged orders with the\r\nplebeians: and as no part of the public funds could be voted for the\r\npurpose, he accordingly built a small shrine of brass[714] in the\r\nGræcostasis,[715] then situate above the Comitium,[716] with the fines\r\nwhich had been exacted for usury. Here, too, he had an inscription\r\nengraved upon a tablet of brass, to the effect that the shrine was\r\ndedicated two hundred and three years after the consecration of the\r\nCapitol. Such were the events that happened four hundred and forty-nine\r\nyears after the foundation of the City, this being the earliest period\r\nat which we find any traces of the common use of rings.\r\n\r\nA second occasion, however, that of the Second Punic War, shows that\r\nrings must have been at that period in very general use; for if such\r\nhad not been the case, it would have been impossible for Hannibal\r\nto send the three[717] modii of rings, which we find so much spoken\r\nof, to Carthage. It was through a dispute, too, at an auction about\r\nthe possession of a ring, that the feud first commenced between\r\nCæpio[718] and Drusus,[719] a dispute which gave rise to the Social\r\nWar,[720] and the public disasters which thence ensued. Not even in\r\nthose days, however, did all the senators possess gold rings, seeing\r\nthat, in the memory of our grandsires, many personages who had even\r\nfilled the prætorship, wore rings of iron to the end of their lives;\r\nCalpurnius,[721] for example, as Fenestella tells us, and Manilius, who\r\nhad been legatus to Caius Marius in the Jugurthine War. Many historians\r\nalso state the same of L. Fufidius, he to whom Scaurus dedicated the\r\nhistory of his life.\r\n\r\nIn the family of the Quintii,[722] it is the usage for no one, not the\r\nfemales even, ever to wear a ring; and even at the present day, the\r\ngreater part of the nations known to us, peoples who are living under\r\nthe Roman sway, are not in the habit of wearing rings. Neither in the\r\ncountries of the East,[723] nor in Egypt, is any use made of seals, the\r\npeople being content with simple writing only.[724]\r\n\r\nIn this, as in every other case, luxury has introduced various\r\nfashions, either by adding to rings gems of exquisite brilliancy, and\r\nso loading the fingers with whole revenues, as we shall have further\r\noccasion to mention in our Book on Gems;[725] or else by engraving them\r\nwith various devices: so that it is in one instance the workmanship,\r\nin another the material, that constitutes the real value of the ring.\r\nThen again, in the case of other gems, luxury has deemed it no less\r\nthan sacrilege to make a mark[726] even upon them, and has caused\r\nthem to be set whole, that no one may suppose that the ring was ever\r\nintended to be employed as a signet. In other instances, luxury has\r\nwilled that certain stones, on the side even that is concealed by the\r\nfinger, should not[727] be closed in with gold, thus making gold of\r\nless account than thousands of tiny pebbles. On the other hand again,\r\nmany persons will admit of no gems being set in their rings, but\r\nimpress their seal with the gold[728] itself, an invention which dates\r\nfrom the reign of Claudius Cæsar. At the present day, too, the very\r\nslaves even, incase their iron rings with gold (while other articles\r\nbelonging to them, they decorate with pure gold),[729] a licence which\r\nfirst originated in the Isle of Samothrace,[730] as the name given to\r\nthe invention clearly shows.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom at first to wear rings on a single finger[731] only,\r\nthe one, namely, that is next to the little finger; and this we see the\r\ncase in the statues of Numa and Servius Tullius. In later times, it\r\nbecame the practice to put rings on the finger next to the thumb, even\r\nin the case of the statues of the gods; and more recently, again, it\r\nhas been the fashion to wear them upon the little finger[732] as well.\r\nAmong the peoples of Gallia and Britannia, the middle finger, it is\r\nsaid, is used for this purpose. At the present day, however, among us,\r\nthis is the only finger that is excepted, all the others being loaded\r\nwith rings, smaller rings even being separately adapted for the smaller\r\njoints of the fingers. Some there are who heap several rings upon the\r\nlittle finger alone; while others, again, wear but one ring upon this\r\nfinger, the ring that sets a seal upon the signet-ring itself, this\r\nlast being kept carefully shut up as an object of rarity, too precious\r\nto be worn in common use, and only to be taken from the cabinet[733]\r\nas from a sanctuary. And thus is the wearing of a single ring upon the\r\nlittle finger no more than an ostentatious advertisement that the owner\r\nhas property of a more precious nature under seal at home!\r\n\r\nSome, too, make a parade of the weight of their rings, while to others\r\nit is quite a labour[734] to wear more than one at a time: some,\r\nin their solicitude for the safety of their gems, make the hoop of\r\ngold tinsel, and fill it with a lighter material than gold, thinking\r\nthereby to diminish the risks of a fall.[735] Others, again, are in\r\nthe habit of inclosing poisons beneath the stones of their rings, and\r\nso wear them as instruments of death; Demosthenes, for instance, that\r\ngreatest of the orators of Greece.[736] And then, besides, how many\r\nof the crimes that are stimulated by cupidity, are committed through\r\nthe instrumentality of rings![737] How happy the times, how truly\r\ninnocent, in which no seal was ever put to anything! At the present\r\nday, on the contrary, our very food even and our drink have to be\r\npreserved from theft[738] through the agency of the ring: a result\r\nowing to those legions of slaves, those throngs of foreigners which are\r\nintroduced into our houses, multitudes so numerous that we require the\r\nservices of a nomenclator[739] even, to tell us the names of our own\r\nservants. Very different was it in the times of our forefathers, when\r\neach person possessed a single servant only, one of his master’s own\r\nlineage, called Marcipor or Lucipor,[740] from his master’s name, as\r\nthe case might be, and taking all his meals with him in common; when,\r\ntoo, there was no occasion for taking precautions at home by keeping a\r\nwatch upon the domestics. But at the present day, we not only procure\r\ndainties which are sure to be pilfered, but hands to pilfer them as\r\nwell; and so far is it from being sufficient to have the very keys\r\nsealed, that the signet-ring is often taken from off the owner’s finger\r\nwhile he is overpowered with sleep or lying on his death-bed.[741]\r\n\r\nIndeed the most important transactions of life are now made to depend\r\nupon this instrument, though at what period this first began to be\r\nthe case, I am at a loss to say. It would appear, however, so far\r\nas foreign nations are concerned, that we may admit the importance\r\nattached to it, from the days of Polycrates,[742] the tyrant of Samos,\r\nwhose favourite ring, after being thrown in the sea, was recovered\r\nfrom a fish that was caught; and this Polycrates, we know, was put\r\nto death[743] about the year of our City, 230. The use of the ring\r\nmust, of necessity, have become greatly extended with the increase of\r\nusury; one proof of which is, the usage still prevalent among the lower\r\nclasses, of whipping off the ring[744] the moment a simple contract is\r\nmade; a practice which takes its date, no doubt, from a period when\r\nthere was no more expeditious method of giving an earnest on closing a\r\nbargain. We may therefore very safely conclude, that though money was\r\nfirst introduced among us, the use of rings was introduced very shortly\r\nafter. Of money, I shall shortly have occasion to speak further.[745]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—THE DECURIES OF THE JUDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRings, as soon as they began to be commonly worn, distinguished the\r\nsecond order from the plebeians, in the same manner as the use of the\r\ntunic[746] distinguished the senate from those who only wore the ring.\r\nStill, however, this last distinction was introduced at a later period\r\nonly, and we find it stated by writers that the public heralds[747]\r\neven were formerly in the habit of wearing the tunic with the purple\r\nlaticlave; the father of Lucius Ælius Stilo,[748] for instance, from\r\nwhom his son received the cognomen of “Præconinus,” in consequence\r\nof his father’s occupation as a herald. But the use of rings, no\r\ndoubt, was the distinguishing mark of a third and intermediate order,\r\nbetween the plebeians and the senators; and the title of “eques,”\r\noriginally derived from the possession of a war-horse,[749] is given\r\nat the present day as an indication of a certain amount of income.\r\nThis, however, is of comparatively recent introduction; for when the\r\nlate Emperor Augustus made his regulations for the decuries,[750] the\r\ngreater part of the members thereof were persons who wore iron rings,\r\nand these bore the name, not of “equites,” but of “judices,” the\r\nformer name being reserved solely for the members of the squadrons[751]\r\nfurnished with war-horses at the public charge.\r\n\r\nOf these judices, too, there were at first but four[752] decuries only,\r\nand in each of these decuries there was hardly one thousand men to be\r\nfound, the provinces not having been hitherto admitted to the office;\r\nan observance which is still in force at the present day, no one newly\r\nadmitted to the rights of citizenship being allowed to perform the\r\nduties of judex as a member of the decuries.\r\n\r\n(2.) These decuries, too, were themselves distinguished by several\r\ndenominations—“tribunes[753] of the treasury,” “selecti,”[754] and\r\n“judices:” in addition to whom, there were the persons styled the “nine\r\nhundred,”[755] chosen from all the decuries for the purpose of keeping\r\nthe voting-boxes at the comitia. From the ambitious adoption, however,\r\nof some one of these names, great divisions ensued in this order, one\r\nperson styling himself a member of the nine hundred, another one of the\r\nselecti, and a third a tribune of the treasury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—PARTICULARS CONNECTED WITH THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length, however, in the ninth[756] year of the reign of the Emperor\r\nTiberius, the equestrian order was united in a single body; and a\r\ndecree was passed, establishing to whom belonged the right of wearing\r\nthe ring, in the consulship of C. Asinius Pollio and C. Antistius\r\nVetus, the year from the foundation of the City, 775. It is a matter\r\nfor surprise, how almost futile, we may say, was the cause which led\r\nto this change. C. Sulpicius Galba,[757] desirous in his youth to\r\nestablish his credit with the Emperor by hunting[758] out grounds for\r\nprosecuting[759] the keepers of victualling-houses, made complaint in\r\nthe senate that the proprietors of those places were in the habit of\r\nprotecting themselves from the consequences of their guilt by their\r\nplea of wearing the golden ring.[760] For this reason, an ordinance\r\nwas made that no person whatsoever should have this right of wearing\r\nthe ring, unless, freeborn himself as regarded his father and paternal\r\ngrandfather, he should be assessed by the censors at four hundred\r\nthousand sesterces, and entitled, under the Julian Law,[761] to sit in\r\nthe fourteen tiers of seats at the theatre. In later times, however,\r\npeople began to apply in whole crowds for this mark of rank; and\r\nin consequence of the diversities of opinion which were occasioned\r\nthereby, the Emperor Caius[762] added a fifth decury to the number.\r\nIndeed to such a pitch has conceit now arisen, that whereas, under the\r\nlate Emperor Augustus, the decuries could not be completed, at the\r\npresent day they will not suffice to receive all the members of the\r\nequestrian order, and we see in every quarter persons even who have\r\nbeen but just liberated from slavery, making a leap all at once to the\r\ndistinction of the golden ring: a thing that never used to happen in\r\nformer days, as it was by the ring of iron that the equites and the\r\njudices were then to be recognized.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so promiscuously was this privilege at last conferred, that\r\nFlavius Proculus, one of the equites, informed against four hundred\r\npersons on this ground, before the Emperor Claudius, who was then\r\ncensor:[763] and thus we see, an order, which was established as a mark\r\nof distinction from other private individuals of free birth, has been\r\nshared in common with slaves!\r\n\r\nThe Gracchi were the first to attach to this order the separate\r\nappellation of “judices,” their object being at the same moment a\r\nseditious popularity and the humiliation of the senate. After the\r\nfall of these men, in consequence of the varying results of seditious\r\nmovements, the name and influence of the equestrian order were lost,\r\nand became merged in those of the publicani,[764] who, for some time,\r\nwere the men that constituted the third class in the state. At last,\r\nhowever, Marcus Cicero, during his consulship, and at the period of the\r\nCatilinarian troubles, re-established the equestrian name, it being his\r\nvaunt that he himself had sprung from that order, and he, by certain\r\nacts of popularity peculiar to himself, having conciliated its support.\r\nSince that period, it is very clear that the equites have formed the\r\nthird body in the state, and the name of the equestrian order has been\r\nadded to the formula—“The Senate and People of Rome.” Hence[765] it is,\r\ntoo, that at the present day even, the name of this order is written\r\nafter that of the people, it being the one that was the last instituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—HOW OFTEN THE NAME OF THE EQUESTRIAN ORDER HAS BEEN CHANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, the name itself of the equites even, has been frequently\r\nchanged, and that too, in the case of those who only owed their name\r\nto the fact of their service on horseback. Under Romulus and the\r\nother kings, the equites were known as “Celeres,”[766] then again as\r\n“Flexuntes,”[767] and after that as “Trossuli,”[768] from the fact of\r\ntheir having taken a certain town of Etruria, situate nine miles on\r\nthis side of Volsinii, without any assistance from the infantry; a name\r\ntoo which survived till after the death of C. Gracchus.\r\n\r\nAt all events, in the writings left by Junius, who, from his affection\r\nfor C. Gracchus, took the name of Gracchanus,[769] we find the\r\nfollowing words—“As regards the equestrian order, its members were\r\nformerly called ‘Trossuli,’ but at the present day they have the\r\nname of ‘Equites;’ because it is not understood what the appellation\r\n‘Trossuli’ really means, and many feel ashamed at being called by\r\nthat name.”[770]—He[771] then goes on to explain the reason, as above\r\nmentioned, and adds that, though much against their will, those persons\r\nare still called “Trossuli.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—GIFTS FOR MILITARY SERVICES, IN GOLD AND SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also some other distinctions connected with gold, the\r\nmention of which ought not to be omitted. Our ancestors, for\r\ninstance, presented torcs[772] of gold to the auxiliaries and foreign\r\ntroops, while to Roman citizens they only granted silver[773] ones:\r\nbracelets[774] too, were given by them to citizens, but never to\r\nforeigners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—AT WHAT PERIOD THE FIRST CROWN OF GOLD WAS PRESENTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, a thing that is more surprising still, crowns[775] of gold were\r\ngiven to the citizens as well. As to the person who was first presented\r\nwith one, so far as I have enquired, I have not been able to ascertain\r\nhis name: L. Piso says, however, that the Dictator[776] A. Posthumius\r\nwas the first who conferred one: on taking the camp of the Latins at\r\nLake Regillus,[777] he gave a crown of gold, made from the spoil, to\r\nthe soldier whose valour had mainly contributed to this success. L.\r\nLentulus, also, when consul,[778] presented one to Servius Cornelius\r\nMerenda, on taking a town of the Samnites; but in his case it was five\r\npounds in weight. Piso Frugi, too, presented his son with a golden\r\ncrown, at his own private expense, making[779] it a specific legacy in\r\nhis will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (3.)—OTHER USES MADE OF GOLD, BY FEMALES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo honour the gods at their sacrifices, no greater mark of honour has\r\nbeen thought of than to gild the horns of the animals sacrificed—that\r\nis, of the larger victims[780] only. But in warfare, this species of\r\nluxury made such rapid advances, that in the Epistles of M. Brutus\r\nfrom the Plains of Philippi, we find expressions of indignation at the\r\nfibulæ[781] of gold that were worn by the tribunes. Yes, so it is, by\r\nHercules! and yet you, the same Brutus, have not said a word about\r\nwomen wearing gold upon their feet; while we, on the other hand, charge\r\nhim with criminality[782] who was the first to confer dignity upon gold\r\nby wearing the ring. Let men even, at the present day, wear gold upon\r\nthe arms in form of bracelets—known as “dardania,” because the practice\r\nfirst originated in Dardania, and called “viriolæ” in the language of\r\nthe Celts, “viriæ”[783] in that of Celtiberia, let women wear gold upon\r\ntheir arms[784] and all their fingers, their necks, their ears, the\r\ntresses of their hair; let chains of gold run meandering along their\r\nsides; and in the still hours of the night let sachets filled with\r\npearls hang suspended from the necks of their mistresses, all bedizened\r\nwith gold, so that in their very sleep even they may still retain the\r\nconsciousness that they are the possessors of such gems: but are\r\nthey to cover their feet[785] as well with gold, and so, between the\r\nstola[786] of the matrons and the garb of the plebeians, establish\r\nan intermediate[787] or equestrian[788] order of females? Much more\r\nbecomingly do we accord this distinction to our pages,[789] and the\r\nadorned beauty of these youths has quite changed the features of our\r\npublic baths.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, too, a fashion has been introduced among the\r\nmen even, of wearing effigies upon their fingers representing\r\nHarpocrates[790] and other divinities of Egypt. In the reign of\r\nClaudius, also, there was introduced another unusual distinction, in\r\nthe case of those to whom was granted the right of free admission,[791]\r\nthat, namely, of wearing the likeness of the emperor engraved in\r\ngold upon a ring: a circumstance that gave rise to vast numbers of\r\ninformations, until the timely elevation of the Emperor Vespasianus\r\nrendered them impossible, by proclaiming that the right of admission to\r\nthe emperor belonged equally to all. Let these particulars suffice on\r\nthe subject of golden rings and the use of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—COINS OF GOLD. AT WHAT PERIODS COPPER, GOLD, AND SILVER\r\nWERE FIRST IMPRESSED. HOW COPPER WAS USED BEFORE GOLD AND SILVER WERE\r\nCOINED. WHAT WAS THE LARGEST SUM OF MONEY POSSESSED BY ANY ONE AT THE\r\nTIME OF OUR FIRST CENSUS. HOW OFTEN, AND AT WHAT PERIODS, THE VALUE OF\r\nCOPPER AND OF COINED MONEY HAS BEEN CHANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next[792] crime committed against the welfare of mankind was on the\r\npart of him who was the first to coin a denarius[793] of gold, a crime\r\nthe author of which is equally unknown. The Roman people made no use\r\nof impressed silver even before the period of the defeat[794] of King\r\nPyrrhus. The “as” of copper weighed exactly one libra; and hence it is\r\nthat we still use the terms “libella”[795] and “dupondius.”[796] Hence\r\nit is, too, that fines and penalties are inflicted under the name of\r\n“æs grave,”[797] and that the words still used in keeping accounts are\r\n“expensa,”[798] “impendia,”[799] and “dependere.”[800] Hence, too, the\r\nword “stipendium,” meaning the pay of the soldiers, which is nothing\r\nmore than “stipis pondera;[801] and from the same source those other\r\nwords, “dispensatores”[802] and “libripendes.”[803] It is also from\r\nthis circumstance that in sales of slaves, at the present day even, the\r\nformality of using the balance is introduced.\r\n\r\nKing Servius was the first to make an impress upon copper. Before his\r\ntime, according to Timæus, at Rome the raw metal only was used. The\r\nform of a sheep was the first figure impressed upon money, and to this\r\nfact it owes its name, “pecunia.”[804] The highest figure at which one\r\nman’s property was assessed in the reign of that king was one hundred\r\nand twenty thousand asses, and consequently that amount of property\r\nwas considered the standard of the first class.\r\n\r\nSilver was not impressed with a mark until the year of the City 485,\r\nthe year of the consulship of Q. Ogulnius and C. Fabius, five years\r\nbefore the First Punic War; at which time it was ordained that the\r\nvalue of the denarius should be ten libræ[805] of copper, that of the\r\nquinarius five libræ, and that of the sestertius two libræ and a half.\r\nThe weight, however, of the libra of copper was diminished during the\r\nFirst Punic War, the republic not having means to meet its expenditure:\r\nin consequence of which, an ordinance was made that the as should in\r\nfuture be struck of two ounces weight. By this contrivance a saving\r\nof five-sixths was effected, and the public debt was liquidated. The\r\nimpression upon these copper coins was a two-faced Janus on one side,\r\nand the beak of a ship of war on the other: the triens,[806] however,\r\nand the quadrans,[807] bore the impression of a ship. The quadrans,\r\ntoo, had, previously to this, been called “teruncius,” as being three\r\nunciæ[808] in weight. At a later period again, when Hannibal was\r\npressing hard upon Rome, in the dictatorship of Q. Fabius Maximus,\r\nasses of one ounce weight were struck, and it was ordained that the\r\nvalue of the denarius should be sixteen asses, that of the quinarius\r\neight asses, and that of the sestertius four asses; by which last\r\nreduction of the weight of the as the republic made a clear gain of one\r\nhalf. Still, however, so far as the pay of the soldiers is concerned,\r\none denarius has always been given for every ten asses. The impressions\r\nupon the coins of silver were two-horse and four-horse chariots, and\r\nhence it is that they received the names of “bigati” and “quadrigati.”\r\n\r\nShortly after, in accordance with the Law of Papirius, asses were\r\ncoined weighing half an ounce only. Livius Drusus, when[809] tribune\r\nof the people, alloyed the silver with one-eighth part of copper. The\r\ncoin that is known at the present day as the “victoriatus,”[810] was\r\nfirst struck in accordance with the Clodian Law: before which period,\r\na coin of this name was imported from Illyricum, but was only looked\r\nupon as an article of merchandize. The impression upon it is a figure\r\nof Victory, and hence its name.\r\n\r\nThe first golden coin was struck sixty-two years after that of silver,\r\nthe scruple of gold being valued at twenty sesterces; a computation\r\nwhich gave, according to the value of the sesterce then in use, nine\r\nhundred sesterces to each libra of gold.[811] In later times, again, an\r\nordinance was made, that denarii of gold should be struck, at the rate\r\nof forty denarii[812] to each libra of gold; after which period, the\r\nemperors gradually curtailed the weight of the golden denarius, until\r\nat last, in the reign of Nero, it was coined at the rate of forty-five\r\nto the libra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—CONSIDERATIONS ON MAN’S CUPIDITY FOR GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the invention of money opened a new field to human avarice, by\r\ngiving rise to usury and the practice of lending money at interest,\r\nwhile the owner passes a life of idleness: and it was with no slow\r\nadvances that, not mere avarice only, but a perfect hunger[813] for\r\ngold became inflamed with a sort of rage for acquiring: to such a\r\ndegree, in fact, that Septimuleius, the familiar friend of Caius\r\nGracchus, not only cut off his head, upon which a price had been set\r\nof its weight in gold, but, before[814] bringing it to Opimius,[815]\r\npoured molten lead into the mouth, and so not only was guilty of the\r\ncrime of parricide, but added to his criminality by cheating the state.\r\nNor was it now any individual citizen, but the universal Roman name,\r\nthat had been rendered infamous by avarice, when King Mithridates\r\ncaused molten gold to be poured into the mouth of Aquilius[816] the\r\nRoman general, whom he had taken prisoner: such were the results of\r\ncupidity.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but feel ashamed, on looking at those new-fangled names\r\nwhich are invented every now and then, from the Greek language, by\r\nwhich to designate vessels of silver filagreed[817] or inlaid with\r\ngold, and the various other practices by which such articles of luxury,\r\nwhen only gilded,[818] are made to sell at a higher price than they\r\nwould have done if made of solid gold: and this, too, when we know that\r\nSpartacus[819] forbade any one of his followers to introduce either\r\ngold or silver into the camp—so much more nobleness of mind was there\r\nin those days, even in our runaway slaves.\r\n\r\nThe orator Messala has informed us that Antonius the triumvir made\r\nuse of golden vessels when satisfying the most humiliating wants of\r\nnature, a piece of criminality that would have reflected disgrace upon\r\nCleopatra even! Till then, the most consummate instances of a similar\r\nlicentiousness had been found among strangers only—that of King Philip,\r\nnamely, who was in the habit of sleeping with a golden goblet placed\r\nbeneath his pillows, and that of Hagnon of Teos, a commander under\r\nAlexander the Great, who used to fasten the soles of his sandals with\r\nnails of gold.[820] It was reserved for Antonius to be the only one\r\nthus to impart a certain utility to gold, by putting an insult upon\r\nNature. Oh how righteously would he himself have been proscribed! but\r\nthen the proscription should have been made by Spartacus.[821]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE PERSONS WHO HAVE POSSESSED THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF GOLD\r\nAND SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I am much surprised that the Roman people has always\r\nimposed upon conquered nations a tribute in silver, and not in gold;\r\nCarthage, for instance, from which, upon its conquest under Hannibal,\r\na ransom was exacted in the shape of a yearly[822] payment, for fifty\r\nyears, of eight hundred thousand pounds’ weight of silver, but no\r\ngold. And yet it does not appear that this could have arisen from\r\nthere being so little gold then in use throughout the world. Midas and\r\nCrœsus, before this, had possessed gold to an endless amount: Cyrus,\r\nalready, on his conquest of Asia,[823] had found a booty consisting of\r\ntwenty-four thousand pounds’ weight of gold, in addition to vessels\r\nand other articles of wrought gold, as well as leaves[824] of trees, a\r\nplane-tree, and a vine, all made of that metal.\r\n\r\nIt was through this conquest too, that he carried off five hundred\r\nthousand[825] talents of silver, as well as the vase of Semiramis,[826]\r\nthe weight of which alone amounted to fifteen talents, the Egyptian\r\ntalent being equal, according to Varro, to eighty of our pounds.\r\nBefore this time too, Saulaces, the descendant of Æëtes, had reigned\r\nin Colchis,[827] who, on finding a tract of virgin earth, in the\r\ncountry of the Suani,[828] extracted from it a large amount of gold\r\nand silver, it is said, and whose kingdom besides, had been famed\r\nfor the possession of the Golden Fleece. The golden arches, too, of\r\nhis palace, we find spoken of, the silver supports and columns, and\r\npilasters, all of which he had come into possession of on the conquest\r\nof Sesostris,[829] king of Egypt; a monarch so haughty, that every\r\nyear, it is said, it was his practice to select one of his vassal kings\r\nby lot, and yoking him to his car, celebrate his triumph afresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER FIRST MADE ITS APPEARANCE UPON THE\r\nARENA AND UPON THE STAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, too, have done things that posterity may probably look upon as\r\nfabulous. Cæsar, who was afterwards dictator, but at that time ædile,\r\nwas the first person, on the occasion of the funeral games in honour of\r\nhis father, to employ all the apparatus of the arena[830] in silver;\r\nand it was on the same occasion that for the first time criminals\r\nencountered wild beasts with implements of silver, a practice imitated\r\nat the present day in our municipal towns even.\r\n\r\nAt the games celebrated by C. Antonius the stage was made of[831]\r\nsilver; and the same was the case at those celebrated by L. Muræna.\r\nThe Emperor Caius had a scaffold[832] introduced into the Circus, upon\r\nwhich there were one hundred and twenty-four thousand pounds’ weight\r\nof silver. His successor Claudius, on the occasion of his triumph over\r\nBritain, announced by the inscriptions that among the coronets of gold,\r\nthere was one weighing seven thousand[833] pounds’ weight, contributed\r\nby Nearer Spain, and another of nine thousand pounds, presented by\r\nGallia Comata.[834] Nero, who succeeded him, covered the Theatre of\r\nPompeius with gold for one day,[835] the occasion on which he displayed\r\nit to Tiridates, king of Armenia. And yet how small was this theatre in\r\ncomparison with that Golden Palace[836] of his, with which he environed\r\nour city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—AT WHAT PERIODS THERE WAS THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF GOLD AND\r\nSILVER IN THE TREASURY OF THE ROMAN PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the consulship of Sextus Julius and Lucius Aurelius,[837] seven\r\nyears before the commencement of the Third Punic War, there was in\r\nthe treasury of the Roman people seventeen thousand four hundred and\r\nten pounds’ weight of uncoined gold, twenty-two thousand and seventy\r\npounds’ weight of silver, and in specie, six million one hundred and\r\nthirty-five thousand four hundred sesterces.\r\n\r\nIn the consulship of Sextus Julius and Lucius Marcius, that is to say,\r\nat the commencement of the Social War,[838] there was in the public\r\ntreasury one million[839] six hundred and twenty thousand eight hundred\r\nand thirty-one pounds’ weight of gold. Caius Cæsar, at his first entry\r\ninto Rome, during the civil war which bears his name, withdrew from\r\nthe treasury fifteen thousand pounds’ weight in gold ingots, thirty\r\nthousand pounds’ weight in uncoined silver, and in specie, three\r\nhundred thousand sesterces: indeed, at no[840] period was the republic\r\nmore wealthy. Æmilius Paulus, too, after the defeat of King Perseus,\r\npaid into the public treasury, from the spoil obtained in Macedonia,\r\nthree hundred millions[841] of sesterces, and from this period the\r\nRoman people ceased to pay tribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—AT WHAT PERIOD CEILINGS WERE FIRST GILDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ceilings which, at the present day, in private houses even, we\r\nsee covered with gold, were first gilded in the Capitol, after\r\nthe destruction of Carthage, and during the censorship of Lucius\r\nMummius.[842] From the ceilings this luxuriousness has been since\r\ntransferred to the arched roofs of buildings, and the party-walls even,\r\nwhich at the present day are gilded like so many articles of plate:\r\nvery different from the times when Catulus[843] was far from being\r\nunanimously approved of for having gilded the brazen tiles of the\r\nCapitol!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—FOR WHAT REASONS THE HIGHEST VALUE IS SET UPON GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already stated, in the Seventh[844] Book, who were the first\r\ndiscoverers of gold, as well as nearly all the other metals. The\r\nhighest rank has been accorded to this substance, not, in my opinion,\r\nfor its colour, (which in silver is clearer[845] and more like the\r\nlight of day, for which reason silver is preferred for our military\r\nensigns, its brightness being seen at a greater distance); and those\r\npersons are manifestly in error who think that it is the resemblance\r\nof its colour to the stars[846] that is so prized in gold, seeing that\r\nthe various gems[847] and other things of the same tint, are in no such\r\nparticular request. Nor yet is it for its weight or malleability[848]\r\nthat gold has been preferred to other metals, it being inferior in\r\nboth these respects to lead—but it is because gold is the only[849]\r\nsubstance in nature that suffers[850] no loss from the action of fire,\r\nand passes unscathed through conflagrations and the flames of the\r\nfuneral pile. Nay, even more than this, the oftener gold is subjected\r\nto the action of fire, the more refined in quality it becomes; indeed,\r\nfire is one test of its goodness, as, when submitted to intense heat,\r\ngold ought to assume a similar colour, and turn red and igneous in\r\nappearance; a mode of testing which is known as “obrussa.”[851]\r\n\r\nThe first great proof, however, of the goodness of gold, is its melting\r\nwith the greatest difficulty: in addition to which, it is a fact truly\r\nmarvellous, that though proof against the most intense fire, if made\r\nwith wood charcoal, it will melt with the greatest readiness upon a\r\nfire made with chaff;[852] and that, for the purpose of purifying it,\r\nit is fused with lead.[853] There is another reason too, which still\r\nmore tends to enhance its value, the fact that it wears the least\r\nof all metals by continual use: whereas with silver, copper, and\r\nlead, lines may be traced,[854] and the hands become soiled with the\r\nsubstance that comes from off them. Nor is there any material more\r\nmalleable than this, none that admits of a more extended division,\r\nseeing that a single ounce of it admits of being beaten out into seven\r\nhundred and fifty[855] leaves, or more, four fingers in length by the\r\nsame in breadth. The thickest kind of gold-leaf is known as “leaf of\r\nPræneste,” it still retaining that name from the excellence of the\r\ngilding upon the statue of Fortune[856] there. The next in thickness\r\nis known as the “quæstorian leaf.” In Spain, small pieces of gold are\r\nknown by the name of “striges.”[857]\r\n\r\nA thing that is not the case with any other metal, gold is found pure\r\nin masses[858] or in the form of dust;[859] and whereas all other\r\nmetals, when found in the ore, require to be brought to perfection by\r\nthe aid of fire, this gold that I am speaking of is gold the moment\r\nit is found, and has all its component parts already in a state of\r\nperfection. This, however, is only such gold as is found in the native\r\nstate, the other kinds that we shall have to speak of, being refined\r\nby art. And then, more than anything else, gold is subject to no rust,\r\nno verdigris,[860] no emanation whatever from it, either to alter its\r\nquality or to lessen its weight. In addition to this, gold steadily\r\nresists the corrosive action of salt and vinegar,[861] things which\r\nobtain the mastery over all other substances: it admits, too, beyond\r\nall other metals, of being spun out and woven[862] like wool.[863]\r\nVerrius tells us that Tarquinius Priscus celebrated a triumph, clad\r\nin a tunic of gold; and I myself have seen Agrippina, the wife of the\r\nEmperor Claudius, on the occasion of a naval combat which he exhibited,\r\nseated by him, attired in a military scarf[864] made entirely of woven\r\ngold without any other material. For this long time past, gold has been\r\ninterwoven in the Attalic[865] textures, an invention of the kings of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—THE METHOD OF GILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn marble and other substances which do not admit of being brought to\r\na white heat, gilt is laid with glair of egg, and on wood by the aid\r\nof a glutinous composition,[866] known as “leucophoron:” what this\r\nlast is, and how it is prepared, we shall state on the appropriate\r\noccasion.[867] The most convenient method for gilding copper would be\r\nto employ quicksilver, or, at all events, hydrargyros;[868] but with\r\nreference to these substances, as we shall have occasion to say when\r\ndescribing the nature[869] of them, methods of adulteration have been\r\ndevised. To effect this mode of gilding, the copper is first well\r\nhammered, after which it is subjected to the action of fire, and then\r\ncooled with a mixture of salt, vinegar, and alum.[870] It is then\r\ncleansed of all extraneous substances, it being known by its brightness\r\nwhen it has been sufficiently purified. This done, it is again heated\r\nby fire, in order to enable it, when thus prepared, with the aid of an\r\namalgam of pumice, alum, and quicksilver, to receive the gold leaf when\r\napplied. Alum has the same property of purifying copper, that we have\r\nalready[871] mentioned us belonging to lead with reference to gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (4.)—HOW GOLD IS FOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold is found in our own part of the world; not to mention the gold\r\nextracted from the earth in India by the ants,[872] and in Scythia by\r\nthe Griffins.[873] Among us it is procured in three different ways; the\r\nfirst of which is, in the shape of dust, found in running streams, the\r\nTagus[874] in Spain, for instance, the Padus in Italy, the Hebrus in\r\nThracia, the Pactolus in Asia, and the Ganges in India; indeed, there\r\nis no gold found in a more perfect state than this, thoroughly polished\r\nas it is by the continual attrition of the current.\r\n\r\nA second mode of obtaining gold is by sinking shafts or seeking it\r\namong the debris of mountains; both of which methods it will be as well\r\nto describe. The persons in search of gold in the first place remove\r\nthe “segutilum,”[875] such being the name of the earth which gives\r\nindication of the presence of gold. This done, a bed is made, the sand\r\nof which is washed, and, according to the residue found after washing,\r\na conjecture is formed as to the richness of the vein. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, gold is found at once in the surface earth, a success, however,\r\nbut rarely experienced. Recently, for instance, in the reign of Nero, a\r\nvein was discovered in Dalmatia, which yielded daily as much as fifty\r\npounds’ weight of gold. The gold that is thus found in the surface\r\ncrust is known as “talutium,”[876] in cases where there is auriferous\r\nearth beneath. The mountains of Spain,[877] in other respects arid and\r\nsterile, and productive of nothing whatever, are thus constrained by\r\nman to be fertile, in supplying him with this precious commodity.\r\n\r\nThe gold that is extracted from shafts is known by some persons as\r\n“canalicium,” and by others as “canaliense;”[878] it is found adhering\r\nto the gritty crust of marble,[879] and, altogether different from the\r\nform in which it sparkles in the sapphirus[880] of the East, and in\r\nthe stone of Thebais[881] and other gems, it is seen interlaced with\r\nthe molecules of the marble. The channels of these veins are found\r\nrunning in various directions along the sides of the shafts, and hence\r\nthe name of the gold they yield—“canalicium.”[882] In these shafts,\r\ntoo, the superincumbent earth is kept from falling in by means of\r\nwooden pillars. The substance that is extracted is first broken up,\r\nand then washed; after which it is subjected to the action of fire,\r\nand ground to a fine powder. This powder is known as “apitascudes,”\r\nwhile the silver which becomes disengaged in the furnace[883] has the\r\nname of “sudor”[884] given to it. The impurities that escape by the\r\nchimney, as in the case of all other metals, are known by the name of\r\n“scoria.” In the case of gold, this scoria is broken up a second time,\r\nand melted over again. The crucibles used for this purpose are made of\r\n“tasconium,”[885] a white earth similar to potter’s clay in appearance;\r\nthere being no other substance capable of withstanding the strong\r\ncurrent of air, the action of the fire, and the intense heat of the\r\nmelted metal.\r\n\r\nThe third method of obtaining gold surpasses the labours of the\r\nGiants[886] even: by the aid of galleries driven to a long distance,\r\nmountains are excavated by the light of torches, the duration of which\r\nforms the set times for work, the workmen never seeing the light of day\r\nfor many months together. These mines are known as “arrugiæ;”[887] and\r\nnot unfrequently clefts are formed on a sudden, the earth sinks in,\r\nand the workmen are crushed beneath; so that it would really appear\r\nless rash to go in search of pearls and purples at the bottom of the\r\nsea, so much more dangerous to ourselves have we made the earth than\r\nthe water! Hence it is, that in this kind of mining, arches are left\r\nat frequent intervals for the purpose of supporting the weight of the\r\nmountain above. In mining either by shaft or by gallery, barriers of\r\nsilex are met with, which have to be driven asunder by the aid of\r\nfire and vinegar;[888] or more frequently, as this method fills the\r\ngalleries with suffocating vapours and smoke, to be broken to pieces\r\nwith bruising-machines shod with pieces of iron weighing one hundred\r\nand fifty pounds: which done, the fragments are carried out on the\r\nworkmen’s shoulders, night and day, each man passing them on to his\r\nneighbour in the dark, it being only those at the pit’s mouth that\r\never see the light. In cases where the bed of silex appears too thick\r\nto admit of being penetrated, the miner traces along the sides of it,\r\nand so turns it. And yet, after all, the labour entailed by this silex\r\nis looked upon as comparatively easy, there being an earth—a kind of\r\npotter’s clay mixed with gravel, “gangadia” by name, which it is almost\r\nimpossible to overcome. This earth has to be attacked with iron wedges\r\nand hammers like those previously mentioned,[889] and it is generally\r\nconsidered that there is nothing more stubborn in existence—except\r\nindeed the greed for gold, which is the most stubborn of all things.\r\n\r\nWhen these operations are all completed, beginning at the last, they\r\ncut away[890] the wooden pillars at the point where they support the\r\nroof: the coming downfall gives warning, which is instantly perceived\r\nby the sentinel, and by him only, who is set to watch upon a peak\r\nof the same mountain. By voice as well as by signals, he orders the\r\nworkmen to be immediately summoned from their labours, and at the same\r\nmoment takes to flight himself. The mountain, rent to pieces, is cleft\r\nasunder, hurling its debris to a distance with a crash which it is\r\nimpossible for the human imagination to conceive; and from the midst of\r\na cloud of dust, of a density quite incredible, the victorious miners\r\ngaze upon this downfall of Nature. Nor yet even then are they sure of\r\ngold, nor indeed were they by any means certain that there was any to\r\nbe found when they first began to excavate, it being quite sufficient,\r\nas an inducement to undergo such perils and to incur such vast expense,\r\nto entertain the hope that they shall obtain what they so eagerly\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nAnother labour, too, quite equal to this, and one which entails\r\neven greater expense, is that of bringing rivers[891] from the more\r\nelevated mountain heights, a distance in many instances of one hundred\r\nmiles perhaps, for the purpose of washing these debris. The channels\r\nthus formed are called “corrugi,” from our word “corrivatio,”[892] I\r\nsuppose; and even when these are once made, they entail a thousand\r\nfresh labours. The fall, for instance, must be steep, that the water\r\nmay be precipitated, so to say, rather than flow; and it is in this\r\nmanner that it is brought from the most elevated points. Then, too,\r\nvallies and crevasses have to be united by the aid of aqueducts, and\r\nin another place impassable rocks have to be hewn away, and forced to\r\nmake room for hollowed troughs of wood; the person hewing them hanging\r\nsuspended all the time with ropes, so that to a spectator who views the\r\noperations from a distance, the workmen have all the appearance, not\r\nso much of wild beasts, as of birds upon the wing.[893] Hanging thus\r\nsuspended in most instances, they take the levels, and trace with lines\r\nthe course the water is to take; and thus, where there is no room even\r\nfor man to plant a footstep, are rivers traced out by the hand of man.\r\nThe water, too, is considered in an unfit state for washing, if the\r\ncurrent of the river carries any mud along with it. The kind of earth\r\nthat yields this mud is known as “urium;”[894] and hence it is that in\r\ntracing out these channels, they carry the water over beds of silex or\r\npebbles, and carefully avoid this urium. When they have reached the\r\nhead of the fall, at the very brow of the mountain, reservoirs are\r\nhollowed out, a couple of hundred feet in length and breadth, and some\r\nten feet in depth. In these reservoirs there are generally five sluices\r\nleft, about three feet square; so that, the moment the reservoir is\r\nfilled, the floodgates are struck away, and the torrent bursts forth\r\nwith such a degree of violence as to roll onwards any fragments of rock\r\nwhich may obstruct its passage.\r\n\r\nWhen they have reached the level ground, too, there is still another\r\nlabour that awaits them. Trenches—known as “agogæ”[895]—have to be\r\ndug for the passage of the water; and these, at regular intervals,\r\nhave a layer of ulex placed at the bottom. This ulex[896] is a plant\r\nlike rosemary in appearance, rough and prickly, and well-adapted for\r\narresting any pieces of gold that may be carried along. The sides, too,\r\nare closed in with planks, and are supported by arches when carried\r\nover steep and precipitous spots. The earth, carried onwards in the\r\nstream, arrives at the sea at last, and thus is the shattered mountain\r\nwashed away; causes which have greatly tended to extend the shores of\r\nSpain by these encroachments upon the deep. It is also by the agency of\r\ncanals of this description that the material, excavated at the cost of\r\nsuch immense labour by the process previously described,[897] is washed\r\nand carried away; for otherwise the shafts would soon be choked up by\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe gold found by excavating with galleries does not require to be\r\nmelted, but is pure gold at once. In these excavations, too, it is\r\nfound in lumps, as also in the shafts which are sunk, sometimes\r\nexceeding ten pounds even. The names given to these lumps are “palagæ,”\r\nand “palacurnæ,”[898] while the gold found in small grains is known\r\nas “baluce.” The ulex that is used for the above purpose is dried and\r\nburnt, after which the ashes of it are washed upon a bed of grassy\r\nturf, in order that the gold may be deposited thereupon.\r\n\r\nAsturia, Gallæcia, and Lusitania furnish in this manner, yearly,\r\naccording to some authorities, twenty thousand pounds’ weight of gold,\r\nthe produce of Asturia forming the major part. Indeed, there is no\r\npart of the world that for centuries has maintained such a continuous\r\nfertility in gold. I have already[899] mentioned that by an ancient\r\ndecree of the senate, the soil of Italy has been protected from these\r\nresearches; otherwise, there would be no land more fertile in metals.\r\nThere is extant also a censorial law relative to the gold mines of\r\nVictumulæ, in the territory of Vercellæ,[900] by which the farmers of\r\nthe revenue were forbidden to employ more than five thousand men at the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—ORPIMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also one other method of procuring gold; by making it from\r\norpiment,[901] a mineral dug from the surface of the earth in Syria,\r\nand much used by painters. It is just the colour of gold, but brittle,\r\nlike mirror-stone,[902] in fact. This substance greatly excited the\r\nhopes of the Emperor Caius,[903] a prince who was most greedy for gold.\r\nHe accordingly had a large quantity of it melted, and really did obtain\r\nsome excellent gold;[904] but then the proportion was so extremely\r\nsmall, that he found himself a loser thereby. Such was the result of\r\nan experiment prompted solely by avarice: and this too, although the\r\nprice of the orpiment itself was no more than four denarii per pound.\r\nSince his time, the experiment has never been repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—ELECTRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all[905] gold ore there is some silver, in varying proportions; a\r\ntenth part in some instances, an eighth in others. In one mine, and\r\nthat only, the one known as the mine of Albucrara, in Gallæcia,[906]\r\nthe proportion of silver is but one thirty-sixth: hence it is that the\r\nore of this mine is so much more valuable than that of others. Whenever\r\nthe proportion of silver is one-fifth, the ore is known also by the\r\nname of “electrum;”[907] grains, too, of this metal are often found\r\nin the gold known as “canaliense.”[908] An artificial[909] electrum,\r\ntoo, is made, by mixing silver with gold. If the proportion of silver\r\nexceeds one-fifth, the metal offers no resistance on the anvil.\r\n\r\nElectrum, too, was highly esteemed in ancient times, as we learn from\r\nthe testimony of Homer, who represents[910] the palace of Menelaüs as\r\nrefulgent with gold and electrum, silver and ivory. At Lindos, in the\r\nisland of Rhodes, there is a temple dedicated to Minerva, in which\r\nthere is a goblet of electrum, consecrated by Helena: history states\r\nalso that it was moulded after the proportions of her bosom. One\r\npeculiar advantage of electrum is, its superior brilliancy to silver by\r\nlamp-light. Native electrum has also the property of detecting poisons;\r\nfor in such case, semicircles, resembling the rainbow in appearance,\r\nwill form upon the surface of the goblet, and emit a crackling noise,\r\nlike that of flame, thus giving a twofold indication of the presence of\r\npoison.[911]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—THE FIRST STATUES OF GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first statue of massive gold, without any hollowness within, and\r\nanterior to any of those statues of bronze even, which are known as\r\n“holosphyratæ,”[912] is said to have been erected in the Temple of\r\nthe goddess Anaïtis. To what particular region this name belongs, we\r\nhave already[913] stated, it being that of a divinity[914] held in\r\nthe highest veneration by the nations in that part of the world. This\r\nstatue was carried off during the wars of Antonius with the people of\r\nParthia; and a witty saying is told, with reference to it, of one of\r\nthe veterans of the Roman army, a native of Bononia. Entertaining on\r\none occasion the late Emperor Augustus at dinner, he was asked by that\r\nprince whether he was aware that the person who was the first to commit\r\nthis violence upon the statue, had been struck with blindness and\r\nparalysis, and then expired. To this he made answer, that at that very\r\nmoment Augustus was making his dinner off of one of her legs, for that\r\nhe himself was the very man, and to that bit of plunder he had been\r\nindebted for all his fortune.[915]\r\n\r\nAs regards statues of human beings, Gorgias of Leontini[916] was the\r\nfirst to erect a solid statue of gold, in the Temple at Delphi, in\r\nhonour of himself, about the seventieth[917] Olympiad: so great were\r\nthe fortunes then made by teaching the art of oratory!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—EIGHT REMEDIES DERIVED FROM GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nGold is efficacious as a remedy in many ways, being applied to\r\nwounded persons and to infants, to render any malpractices of sorcery\r\ncomparatively innocuous that may be directed against them. Gold,\r\nhowever, itself is mischievous in its effects if carried over the\r\nhead, in the case of chickens and lambs more particularly. The proper\r\nremedy in such case is to wash the gold, and to sprinkle the water upon\r\nthe objects which it is wished to preserve. Gold, too, is melted with\r\ntwice its weight of salt, and three times its weight of misy;[918]\r\nafter which it is again melted with two parts of salt and one of the\r\nstone called “schistos.”[919] Employed in this manner, it withdraws\r\nthe natural acridity from the substances torrefied with it in the\r\ncrucible, while at the same time it remains pure and incorrupt; the\r\nresidue forming an ash which is preserved in an earthen vessel, and is\r\napplied with water for the cure of lichens on the face: the best method\r\nof washing it off is with bean-meal. These ashes have the property also\r\nof curing fistulas and the discharges known as “hæmorrhoides:” with the\r\naddition, too, of powdered pumice, they are a cure for putrid ulcers\r\nand sores which emit an offensive smell.\r\n\r\nGold, boiled in honey with melanthium[920] and applied as a liniment to\r\nthe navel, acts as a gentle purgative upon the bowels. M. Varro assures\r\nus that gold is a cure for warts.[921]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26. (5.)—CHRYSOCOLLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrysocolla[922] is a liquid which is found in the shafts already\r\nmentioned,[923] flowing through the veins of gold; a kind of slime\r\nwhich becomes indurated by the cold of winter till it has attained the\r\nhardness even of pumice. The most esteemed kind of it, it has been\r\nascertained, is found in copper-mines, the next best being the produce\r\nof silver-mines: it is found also in lead-mines, but that found in\r\ncombination with gold ore is much inferior.\r\n\r\nIn all these mines, too, an artificial chrysocolla is manufactured;\r\nmuch inferior, however, to the native chrysocolla. The method of\r\npreparing it consists in introducing water gradually into a vein of\r\nmetal, throughout the winter and until the month of June; after which,\r\nit is left to dry up during the months of June and July: so that, in\r\nfact, it is quite evident that chrysocolla is nothing else but the\r\nputrefaction of a metallic vein. Native chrysocolla, known as “uva,”\r\ndiffers from the other in its hardness more particularly; and yet,\r\nhard as it is, it admits of being coloured with the plant known as\r\n“lutum.”[924] Like flax and wool, it is of a nature which imbibes\r\nliquids. For the purpose of dyeing it, it is first bruised in a mortar,\r\nafter which, it is passed through a fine sieve. This done, it is\r\nground, and then passed through a still finer sieve; all that refuses\r\nto pass being replaced in the mortar, and subjected once more to the\r\nmill. The finest part of the powder is from time to time measured out\r\ninto a crucible, where it is macerated in vinegar, so that all the\r\nhard particles may be dissolved; after which, it is pounded again,\r\nand then rinsed in shell-shaped vessels, and left to dry. This done,\r\nthe chrysocolla is dyed by the agency of schist alum[925] and the\r\nplant above-mentioned; and thus is it painted itself before it serves\r\nto paint. It is of considerable importance, too, that it should be\r\nabsorbent and readily take the dye: indeed, if it does not speedily\r\ntake the colour, scytanum and turbistum[926] are added to the dye; such\r\nbeing the name of two drugs which compel it to absorb the colouring\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—THE USE MADE OF CHRYSOCOLLA IN PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen chrysocolla has been thus dyed, painters call it “orobitis,” and\r\ndistinguish two kinds of it, the cleansed[927] orobitis,[928] which\r\nis kept for making lomentum,[929] and the liquid, the balls being\r\ndissolved for use by evaporation.[930] Both these kinds are prepared\r\nin Cyprus,[931] but the most esteemed is that made in Armenia, the\r\nnext best being that of Macedonia: it is Spain, however, that produces\r\nthe most. The great point of its excellence consists in its producing\r\nexactly the tint of corn when in a state of the freshest verdure.[932]\r\nBefore now, we have seen, at the spectacles exhibited by the Emperor\r\nNero, the arena of the Circus entirely sanded with chrysocolla, when\r\nthe prince himself, clad in a dress of the same colour, was about to\r\nexhibit as a charioteer.[933]\r\n\r\nThe unlearned multitude of artisans distinguish three kinds of\r\nchrysocolla; the rough chrysocolla, which is valued at seven denarii\r\nper pound; the middling, worth five denarii; and the bruised, also\r\nknown as the “herbaceous” chrysocolla, worth three denarii per pound.\r\nBefore laying on the sanded[934] chrysocolla, they underlay coats of\r\natramentum[935] and parætonium,[936] substances which make it hold, and\r\nimpart a softness to the colours. The parætonium, as it is naturally\r\nvery unctuous, and, from its smoothness, extremely tenacious, is laid\r\non first, and is then covered with a coat of atramentum, lest the\r\nparætonium, from its extreme whiteness, should impart a paleness to\r\nthe chrysocolla. The kind known as “lutea,” derives its name, it is\r\nthought, from the plant called “lutum;” which itself is often pounded\r\nwith cæruleum[937] instead of real chrysocolla, and used for painting,\r\nmaking a very inferior kind of green and extremely deceptive.[938]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—SEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CHRYSOCOLLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nChroysocolla, too, is made use of in medicine. In combination with\r\nwax and oil, it is used as a detergent for wounds; and used by itself\r\nin the form of a powder, it acts as a desiccative, and heals them.\r\nIn cases, too, of quinsy and hardness of breathing, chrysocolla is\r\nprescribed, in the form of an electuary, with honey. It acts as an\r\nemetic also, and is used as an ingredient in eye-salves, for the\r\npurpose of effacing cicatrizations upon the eyes. In green plasters\r\ntoo, it is used, for soothing pain and making scars disappear. This\r\nkind of chrysocolla[939] is known by medical men as “acesis,” and is\r\naltogether different from orobitis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—THE CHRYSOCOLLA OF THE GOLDSMITHS, KNOWN ALSO AS SANTERNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goldsmiths also employ a chrysocolla[940] of their own, for the\r\npurpose of soldering gold; and it is from this chrysocolla, they say,\r\nthat all the other substances, which present a similar green, have\r\nreceived their name. This preparation is made from verdigris of Cyprian\r\ncopper, the urine of a youth who has not arrived at puberty, and a\r\nportion of nitre.[941] It is then pounded with a pestle of Cyprian\r\ncopper, in a copper mortar, and the name given to the mixture is\r\n“santerna.” It is in this way that the gold known as “silvery”[942]\r\ngold is soldered; one sign of its being so alloyed being its additional\r\nbrilliancy on the application of santerna. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe gold is impregnated with copper, it will contract, on coming in\r\ncontact with the santerna, become dull, and only be soldered with the\r\ngreatest difficulty: indeed, for this last kind of gold, there is a\r\npeculiar solder employed, made of gold and one-seventh part of silver,\r\nin addition to the materials above-mentioned, the whole beaten up\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—THE MARVELLOUS OPERATIONS OF NATURE IN SOLDERING METALLIC\r\nSUBSTANCES, AND BRINGING THEM TO A STATE OF PERFECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile speaking on this subject, it will be as well to annex the\r\nremaining particulars, that our admiration may here be drawn to all the\r\nmarvels presented by Nature in connection therewith. The proper solder\r\nfor gold is that above described; for iron, potter’s clay; for copper,\r\nwhen in masses, cadmia,[943] and in sheets, alum; for lead and marble,\r\nresin. Lead is also united by the aid of white lead;[944] white lead\r\nwith white lead, by the agency of oil; stannum, with copper file-dust;\r\nand silver, with stannum.[945]\r\n\r\nFor smelting copper and iron, pine-wood is the best, Egyptian papyrus\r\nbeing also very good for the purpose. Gold is melted most easily with a\r\nfire made of chaff.[946] Limestone and Thracian stone[947] are ignited\r\nby the agency of water, this last being extinguished by the application\r\nof oil. Fire, however, is extinguished most readily by the application\r\nof vinegar, viscus,[948] and unboiled eggs. Earth will under no\r\ncircumstance ignite. When charcoal has been once quenched, and then\r\nagain ignited, it gives out a greater heat than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (6.)—SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter stating these facts, we come to speak of silver ore, the\r\nnext[949] folly of mankind. Silver is never found but in shafts sunk\r\ndeep in the ground, there being no indications to raise hopes of its\r\nexistence, no shining sparkles, as in the case of gold. The earth in\r\nwhich it is found is sometimes red, sometimes of an ashy hue. It is\r\nimpossible, too, to melt[950] it, except in combination with lead[951]\r\nor with galena,[952] this last being the name given to the vein of lead\r\nthat is mostly found running near the veins of the silver ore. When\r\nsubmitted, too, to the action of fire, part of the ore precipitates\r\nitself in the form of lead,[953] while the silver is left floating on\r\nthe surface,[954] like oil on water.\r\n\r\nSilver is found in nearly all our provinces, but the finest of all is\r\nthat of Spain; where it is found, like gold, in uncultivated soils,\r\nand in the mountains even. Wherever, too, one vein of silver has been\r\nmet with, another is sure to be found not far off: a thing that has\r\nbeen remarked, in fact, in the case of nearly all the metals, which\r\nwould appear from this circumstance to have derived their Greek name\r\nof “metalla.”[955] It is a remarkable fact, that the shafts opened by\r\nHannibal[956] in the Spanish provinces are still worked, their names\r\nbeing derived from the persons who were the first to discover them.\r\nOne of these mines, which at the present day is still called Bæbelo,\r\nfurnished Hannibal with three hundred pounds’ weight of silver per\r\nday. The mountain is already excavated for a distance of fifteen\r\nhundred[957] paces; and throughout the whole of this distance there\r\nare water-bearers[958] standing night and day, baling out the water in\r\nturns, regulated by the light of torches, and so forming quite a river.\r\n\r\nThe vein of silver that is found nearest the surface is known by the\r\nname of “crudaria.”[959] In ancient times, the excavations used to be\r\nabandoned the moment alum[960] was met with, and no further[961] search\r\nwas made. Of late, however, the discovery of a vein of copper beneath\r\nalum, has withdrawn any such limits to man’s hopes. The exhalations\r\nfrom silver-mines are dangerous to all animals, but to dogs more\r\nparticularly. The softer they are, the more beautiful gold and silver\r\nare considered. It is a matter of surprise with most persons, that\r\nlines traced[962] with silver should be black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—QUICKSILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a mineral also found in these veins of silver, which yields a\r\nhumour that is always[963] liquid, and is known as “quicksilver.”[964]\r\nIt acts as a poison[965] upon everything, and pierces vessels\r\neven, making its way through them by the agency of its malignant\r\nproperties.[966] All substances float upon the surface of quicksilver,\r\nwith the exception of gold,[967] this being the only substance that\r\nit attracts to itself.[968] Hence it is, that it is such an excellent\r\nrefiner of gold; for, on being briskly shaken in an earthen vessel with\r\ngold, it rejects all the impurities that are mixed with it. When once\r\nit has thus expelled these superfluities, there is nothing to do but to\r\nseparate it from the gold; to effect which, it is poured out upon skins\r\nthat have been well tawed, and so, exuding through them like a sort of\r\nperspiration, it leaves the gold in a state of purity behind.[969]\r\n\r\nHence it is, too, that when copper has to be gilded,[970] a coat of\r\nquicksilver is laid beneath the gold leaf, which it retains in its\r\nplace with the greatest tenacity: in cases, however, where the leaf\r\nis single, or very thin, the presence of the quicksilver is detected\r\nby the paleness of the colour.[971] For this reason, persons, when\r\nmeditating a piece of fraud, have been in the habit of substituting\r\nglair of egg for quicksilver, and then laying upon it a coat of\r\nhydrargyros, a substance of which we shall make further mention in the\r\nappropriate place.[972] Generally speaking, quicksilver has not been\r\nfound in any large quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—STIMMI, STIBI, ALABASTRUM, LARBASIS, OR PLATYOPHTHALMON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same mines in which silver is found, there is also found\r\na substance which, properly speaking, may be called a stone\r\nmade of concrete froth.[973] It is white and shining, without\r\nbeing transparent, and has the several names of stimmi, stibi,\r\nalabastrum,[974] and larbasis. There are two kinds of it, the male and\r\nthe female.[975] The latter kind is the more approved of, the male[976]\r\nstimmi being more uneven, rougher to the touch, less ponderous, not so\r\nradiant, and more gritty. The female kind, on the other hand, is bright\r\nand friable, and separates in laminæ, and not in globules.[977]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—SEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED PROM STIMMI.\r\n\r\n\r\nStimmi is possessed of certain astringent and refrigerative properties,\r\nits principal use, in medicine, being for the eyes. Hence it is that\r\nmost persons call it “platyophthalmon,”[978] it being extensively\r\nemployed in the calliblepharic[979] preparations of females, for the\r\npurpose of dilating the eyes. It acts also as a check upon fluxes of\r\nthe eyes and ulcerations of those organs; being used, as a powder, with\r\npounded frankincense and gum. It has the property, too, of arresting\r\ndischarges of blood from the brain; and, sprinkled in the form of a\r\npowder, it is extremely efficacious for the cure of recent wounds and\r\nbites of dogs which have been some time inflicted. For the cure of\r\nburns it is remarkably good, mixed with grease, litharge,[980] ceruse,\r\nand wax.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing it, is to burn it, enclosed in a coat of\r\ncow-dung, in a furnace; which done, it is quenched with woman’s milk,\r\nand pounded with rain-water in a mortar.[981] While this is doing,\r\nthe thick and turbid part is poured off from time to time into a\r\ncopper vessel, and purified with nitre.[982] The lees of it, which are\r\nrejected, are recognized by their being full of lead and falling to\r\nthe bottom. The vessel into which the turbid part has been poured off,\r\nis then covered with a linen cloth and left untouched for a night;\r\nthe portion that lies upon the surface being poured off the following\r\nday, or else removed with a sponge. The part that has fallen to the\r\nbottom of the vessel is regarded as the choicest[983] part, and is\r\nleft, covered with a linen cloth, to dry in the sun, but not to become\r\nparched. This done, it is again pounded in a mortar, and then divided\r\ninto tablets. But the main thing of all is, to observe such a degree of\r\nnicety in heating it, as not to let it become lead.[984] Some persons,\r\nwhen preparing it on the fire, use grease[985] instead of dung. Others,\r\nagain, bruise it in water and then pass it through a triple strainer\r\nof linen cloth; after which, they reject the lees, and pour off the\r\nremainder of the liquid, collecting all that is deposited at the\r\nbottom, and using it as an ingredient in plasters and eye-salves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—THE SCORIA OF SILVER. SIX REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scoria of silver is called by the Greeks “helcysma.”[986] It has\r\ncertain restringent and refrigerative effects upon bodies, and, like\r\nmolybdæna, of which we shall make further mention when speaking[987]\r\nof lead, is used as an ingredient in making plasters, those more\r\nparticularly which are to promote the cicatrization of wounds. It is\r\nemployed also for the cure of tenesmus and dysentery, being injected\r\nin the form of a clyster with myrtle-oil. It forms an ingredient, too,\r\nin the medicaments known as “liparæ,”[988] for the removal of fleshy\r\nexcrescences in sores, ulcerations arising from chafing, or running\r\nulcers on the head.\r\n\r\nThe same mines also furnish us with the preparation known as “scum of\r\nsilver.”[989] There are three[990] varieties of it; the best, known as\r\n“chrysitis;” the second best, the name of which is “argyritis;” and a\r\nthird kind, which is called “molybditis.” In most instances, too, all\r\nthese tints are to be found in the same cake.[991]\r\n\r\nThe most approved kind is that of Attica; the next being that which\r\ncomes from Spain. Chrysitis is the produce of the metallic vein,[992]\r\nargyritis is obtained from the silver itself, and molybditis is the\r\nresult of the smelting of lead,[993] a work that is done at Puteoli; to\r\nwhich last circumstance, in fact, molybditis owes its name.[994] All\r\nthese substances are prepared in the following manner: the metal is\r\nfirst melted, and then allowed to flow from a more elevated receiver\r\ninto a lower. From this last it is lifted by the aid of iron spits,\r\nand is then twirled round at the end of the spit in the midst of the\r\nflames, in order to make it all the lighter. Thus, as may be easily\r\nperceived from the name, it is in reality the scum of a substance in\r\na state of fusion—of the future metal, in fact. It differs from scoria\r\nin the same way that the scum of a liquid differs from the lees, the\r\none[995] being an excretion thrown out by the metal while purifying\r\nitself, the other[996] an excretion of the metal when purified.\r\n\r\nSome persons distinguish two kinds of scum of silver, and give them\r\nthe names of “scirerytis” and “peumene;”[997] a third variety being\r\nmolybdæna, of which we shall have to make further mention when treating\r\nof lead.[998] To make this scum fit for use, the cakes are again broken\r\ninto pieces the size of a hazel-nut, and then melted, the fire being\r\nbriskly blown with the bellows. For the purpose of separating the\r\ncharcoal and ashes from it, it is then rinsed with vinegar or with\r\nwine, and is so quenched. In the case of argyritis, it is recommended,\r\nin order to blanch it, to break it into pieces the size of a bean, and\r\nthen to boil it with water in an earthen vessel, first putting with\r\nit, wrapped in linen cloths, some new wheat and barley, which are left\r\nthere till they have lost the outer coat. This done, they bruise the\r\nwhole in mortars for six consecutive days, taking care to rinse the\r\nmixture in cold water three times a day, and after that, in an infusion\r\nof hot water and fossil salt, one obolus of the latter to every pound\r\nof scum: at the end of the six days it is put away for keeping in a\r\nvessel of lead.\r\n\r\nSome persons boil it with white beans and a ptisan[999] of barley, and\r\nthen dry it in the sun; others, again, with white wool and beans, till\r\nsuch time as it imparts no darkness to the wool; after which, first\r\nadding fossil[1000] salt, they change the water from time to time, and\r\nthen dry it during the forty hottest days of summer. In some instances\r\nthe practice is, to boil it in water in a swine’s paunch, and then to\r\ntake it out and rub it with nitre; after which, following the preceding\r\nmethod, they pound it in a mortar with salt. Some again never boil it,\r\nbut pound it only with salt, and then rinse it with water.\r\n\r\nScum of silver is used as an ingredient in eye-salves, and, in the\r\nform of a liniment, by females, for the purpose of removing spots\r\nand blemishes caused by scars, as also in washes for the hair. Its\r\nproperties are desiccative, emollient, refrigerative, temperative, and\r\ndetergent. It fills up cavities in the flesh produced by ulceration,\r\nand reduces tumours. For all these purposes it is employed as an\r\ningredient in plaster, and in the liparæ previously mentioned.[1001] In\r\ncombination with rue, myrtle, and vinegar, it removes erysipelas: and,\r\nwith myrtle and wax, it is a cure for chilblains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36. (7.)—MINIUM: FOR WHAT RELIGIOUS PURPOSES IT WAS USED BY THE\r\nANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also in silver-mines that minium[1002] is found, a pigment held\r\nat the present day in very high estimation; and by the Romans in former\r\ntimes not only held in the highest estimation, but used for sacred\r\npurposes as well. Verrius enumerates certain authors, upon whose\r\ntestimony we find it satisfactorily established that it was the custom\r\nupon festivals to colour the face of the statue of Jupiter even with\r\nminium, as well as the bodies[1003] of triumphant generals; and that it\r\nwas in this guise that Camillus celebrated his triumph. We find, too,\r\nthat it is through the same religious motives that it is employed at\r\nthe present day for colouring the unguents used at triumphal banquets,\r\nand that it is the first duty of the censors to make a contract for\r\npainting the statue of Jupiter[1004] with this colour.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I am quite at a loss for the origin of this usage; but\r\nit is a well-known fact, that at the present day even, minium is in\r\ngreat esteem with the nations of Æthiopia, their nobles being in the\r\nhabit of staining the body all over with it, and this being the colour\r\nappropriated to the statues of their gods. I shall therefore use all\r\nthe more diligence in enquiring into all the known facts respecting it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—THE DISCOVERY AND ORIGIN OF MINIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheophrastus states that, ninety years before the magistracy of\r\nPraxibulus at Athens—a date which answers to the year of our City,\r\n439—minium was discovered by Callias the Athenian, who was in hopes to\r\nextract gold, by submitting to the action of fire the red sand that\r\nwas found in the silver-mines. This, he says, was the first discovery\r\nof minium. He states, also, that in his own time, it was already found\r\nin Spain, but of a harsh and sandy nature; as also in Colchis, upon\r\na certain inaccessible rock there, from which it was brought down by\r\nthe agency of darts. This, however, he says, was only an adulterated\r\nkind of minium, the best of all being that procured in the Cilbian\r\nPlains,[1005] above Ephesus, the sand of which has just the colour\r\nof the kermes berry.[1006] This sand, he informs us, is first ground\r\nto powder and then washed, the portion that settles at the bottom\r\nbeing subjected to a second washing. From this circumstance, he says,\r\narises a difference in the article; some persons being in the habit\r\nof preparing their minium with a single washing, while with others it\r\nis more diluted. The best kind, however, he says, is that which has\r\nundergone a second washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—CINNABARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not surprised that this colour should have been held in such high\r\nesteem; for already, in the days of the Trojan War, rubrica[1007] was\r\nhighly valued, as appears from the testimony of Homer, who particularly\r\nnotices the ships that were coloured with it, whereas, in reference\r\nto other colours and paintings, he but rarely notices them. The\r\nGreeks call this red earth “miltos,” and give to minium the name of\r\n“cinnabaris,” and hence the error[1008] caused by the two meanings\r\nof the same word; this being properly the name given to the thick\r\nmatter which issues from the dragon when crushed beneath the weight of\r\nthe dying elephant, mixed with the blood of either animal, as already\r\ndescribed.[1009] Indeed this last is the only colour that in painting\r\ngives a proper representation of blood. This cinnabaris, too, is\r\nextremely useful as an ingredient in antidotes and various medicaments.\r\nBut, by Hercules! our physicians, because minium also has the name of\r\n“cinnabaris,” use it as a substitute for the other, and so employ a\r\npoison, as we shall shortly[1010] show it to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—THE EMPLOYMENT OF CINNABARIS IN PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients used to paint with cinnabaris[1011] those pictures of one\r\ncolour, which are still known among us as “monochromata.”[1012] They\r\npainted also with the minium of Ephesus:[1013] but the use of this last\r\nhas been abandoned, from the vast trouble which the proper keeping of\r\nthe picture entailed. And then besides, both these colours were thought\r\nto be too harsh; the consequence of which is, that painters have now\r\nadopted the use of rubrica[1014] and of sinopis, substances of which I\r\nshall make further mention in the appropriate places.[1015]\r\n\r\nCinnabaris[1016] is adulterated by the agency of goats’ blood, or of\r\nbruised sorb-apples. The price of genuine cinnabaris is fifty sesterces\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MINIUM. THE USE MADE OF IT IN PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Juba minium is also a production of Carmania,[1017] and\r\nTimagenes says that it is found in Æthiopia. But from neither of\r\nthose regions is it imported to Rome, nor, indeed, from hardly any\r\nother quarter but Spain; that of most note coming from Sisapo,[1018]\r\na territory of Bætica, the mine of minium there forming a part of the\r\nrevenues of the Roman people. Indeed there is nothing guarded with a\r\nmore constant circumspection; for it is not allowable to reduce and\r\nrefine the ore upon the spot, it being brought to Rome in a crude state\r\nand under seal, to the amount of about two thousand pounds per annum.\r\nAt Rome, the process of washing is performed, and, in the sale of it,\r\nthe price is regulated by statute; it not being allowed to exceed[1019]\r\nseventy sesterces per pound. There are numerous ways, however, of\r\nadulterating it, a source of considerable plunder to the company.[1020]\r\n\r\nFor there is, in fact, another kind[1021] of minium, found in most\r\nsilver-mines as well as lead-mines, and prepared by the calcination\r\nof certain stones that are found mixed with the metallic vein—not the\r\nminerals, however, to the fluid humours of which we have given[1022]\r\nthe name of quicksilver; for if those are subjected to the action of\r\nfire they will yield silver—but another kind of stone[1023] that is\r\nfound with them. These barren[1024] stones, too, may be recognized\r\nby their uniform leaden colour, and it is only when in the furnace\r\nthat they turn red. After being duly calcined they are pulverized,\r\nand thus form a minium of second-rate quality, known to but very\r\nfew, and far inferior to the produce of the native sand that we have\r\nmentioned.[1025] It is with this substance, then, as also with syricum,\r\nthat the genuine minium is adulterated in the manufactories of the\r\ncompany. How syricum is prepared we shall describe in the appropriate\r\nplace.[1026] One motive, however, for giving an under-coat of syricum\r\nto minium, is the evident saving of expense that results therefrom.\r\nMinium, too, in another way affords a very convenient opportunity to\r\npainters for pilfering, by washing their brushes,[1027] filled with\r\nthe colouring matter, every now and then. The minium of course falls to\r\nthe bottom, and is thus so much gained by the thief.\r\n\r\nGenuine minium ought to have the brilliant colour of the kermes\r\nberry;[1028] but when that of inferior quality is used for walls, the\r\nbrightness of it is sure to be tarnished by the moisture, and this\r\ntoo, although the substance itself is a sort of metallic mildew. In\r\nthe mines of Sisapo, the veins are composed exclusively of the sandy\r\nparticles of minium, without the intermixture of any silver whatever;\r\nthe practice being to melt it like gold. Minium is assayed by the\r\nagency of gold in a state of incandescence: if it has been adulterated,\r\nit will turn black, but if genuine, it retains its colour. I find it\r\nstated also that minium is adulterated with lime; the proper mode of\r\ndetecting which, is similarly to employ a sheet of red hot iron, if\r\nthere should happen to be no gold at hand.\r\n\r\nTo objects painted with minium the action of the sun and moon is highly\r\ninjurious. The proper method of avoiding this inconvenience, is to dry\r\nthe wall, and then to apply, with, a hair brush, hot Punic wax, melted\r\nwith oil; after which, the varnish must be heated, with an application\r\nof gall-nuts, burnt to a red heat, till it quite perspires. This done,\r\nit must be smoothed down with rollers[1029] made of wax, and then\r\npolished with clean linen cloths, like marble, when made to shine.\r\nPersons employed in the manufactories in preparing minium protect the\r\nface with masks of loose bladder-skin, in order to avoid inhaling the\r\ndust, which is highly pernicious; the covering being at the same time\r\nsufficiently transparent to admit of being seen through.\r\n\r\nMinium is employed also for writing[1030] in books; and the letters\r\nmade with it being more distinct, even on gold or marble, it is used\r\nfor the inscriptions upon tombs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41. (8.)—HYDRARGYROS. REMEDIES DERIVED FROM MINIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHuman industry has also discovered a method of extracting\r\nhydrargyros[1031] from the inferior minium, a substitute for\r\nquicksilver, the further mention of which was deferred, a few pages\r\nbefore,[1032] to the present occasion. There are two methods of\r\npreparing this substance; either by pounding minium and vinegar with a\r\nbrazen pestle and mortar, or else by putting minium into flat earthen\r\npans, covered with a lid, and then enclosed in an iron seething-pot\r\nwell luted with potter’s clay. A fire is then lighted under the pans,\r\nand the flame kept continually burning by the aid of the bellows; which\r\ndone, the steam is carefully removed, that is found adhering to the\r\nlid, being like silver in colour, and similar to water in its fluidity.\r\nThis liquid, too, is easily made to separate in globules, which, from\r\ntheir fluid nature, readily unite.[1033]\r\n\r\nAs it is a fact generally admitted, that minium is a poison,[1034] I\r\nlook upon all the recipes given as highly dangerous which recommend\r\nits employment for medicinal purposes; with the exception, perhaps,\r\nof those cases in which it is applied to the head or abdomen, for the\r\npurpose of arresting hæmorrhage, due care being taken that it is not\r\nallowed to penetrate to the viscera, or to touch any sore. Beyond such\r\ncases as these, for my own part, I should never recommend it to be used\r\nin medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—THE METHOD OF GILDING SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present day silver is gilded almost exclusively by the agency\r\nof hydrargyros;[1035] and a similar method should always be employed\r\nin laying gold leaf upon copper. But the same fraud which ever shows\r\nitself so extremely ingenious in all departments of human industry,\r\nhas devised a plan of substituting an inferior material, as already\r\nmentioned.[1036]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—TOUCHSTONES FOR TESTING GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA description of gold and silver is necessarily accompanied by that\r\nof the stone known as “coticula.”[1037] In former times, according\r\nto Theophrastus, this stone was nowhere to be found, except in the\r\nriver Tmolus,[1038] but at the present day it is found in numerous\r\nplaces. By some persons it is known as the “Heraclian,” and by others\r\nas the “Lydian” stone. It is found in pieces of moderate size, and\r\nnever exceeding four inches in length by two in breadth. The side\r\nthat has lain facing the sun is superior[1039] to that which has lain\r\nnext to the ground. Persons of experience in these matters, when they\r\nhave scraped a particle off the ore with this stone, as with a file,\r\ncan tell in a moment the proportion of gold there is in it, how much\r\nsilver, or how much copper; and this to a scruple, their accuracy being\r\nso marvellous that they are never mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF SILVER, AND THE MODES OF TESTING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of silver. On placing a piece of it upon an iron\r\nfire-shovel at a white heat, if the metal remains perfectly white, it\r\nis of the best quality: if again it turns of a reddish colour, it is\r\ninferior; but if it becomes black, it is worthless. Fraud, however,\r\nhas devised means of stultifying this test even; for by keeping the\r\nshovel immersed in men’s urine, the piece of silver absorbs it as it\r\nburns, and so displays a fictitious whiteness. There is also a kind of\r\ntest with reference to polished silver: when the human breath comes in\r\ncontact with it, it should immediately be covered with steam,[1040] the\r\ncloudiness disappearing at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45. (9.)—MIRRORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed among us that it is only the very finest\r\nsilver that admits of being laminated, and so converted into mirrors.\r\nPure silver was formerly used for the purpose, but, at the present\r\nday, this too has been corrupted by the devices of fraud. But, really,\r\nit is a very marvellous property that this metal has, of reflecting\r\nobjects; a property which, it is generally agreed, results from the\r\nrepercussion of the air,[1041] thrown back as it is from the metal\r\nupon the eyes. The same too is the action that takes place when we use\r\na mirror. If, again, a thick plate of this metal is highly polished,\r\nand is rendered slightly concave,[1042] the image or object reflected\r\nis enlarged to an immense extent; so vast is the difference between\r\na surface receiving,[1043] and throwing back the air. Even more than\r\nthis—drinking-cups are now made in such a manner, as to be filled\r\ninside with numerous[1044] concave facets, like so many mirrors; so\r\nthat if but one person looks into the interior, he sees reflected a\r\nwhole multitude of persons.\r\n\r\nMirrors, too, have been invented to reflect monstrous[1045] forms;\r\nthose, for instance, which have been consecrated in the Temple at\r\nSmyrna. This, however, all results from the configuration given to\r\nthe metal; and it makes all the difference whether the surface has\r\na concave form like the section of a drinking cup, or whether it is\r\n[convex] like a Thracian[1046] buckler; whether it is depressed in\r\nthe middle or elevated; whether the surface has a direction[1047]\r\ntransversely or obliquely; or whether it runs horizontally or\r\nvertically; the peculiar configuration of the surface which receives\r\nthe shadows, causing them to undergo corresponding distortions:\r\nfor, in fact, the image is nothing else but the shadow of the object\r\ncollected upon the bright surface of the metal.\r\n\r\nHowever, to finish our description of mirrors on the present[1048]\r\noccasion—the best, in the times of our ancestors, were those of\r\nBrundisium,[1049] composed of a mixture of[1050] stannum and copper:\r\nat a later period, however, those made of silver were preferred,\r\nPasiteles[1051] being the first who made them, in the time[1052] of\r\nPompeius Magnus. More recently,[1053] a notion has arisen that the\r\nobject is reflected with greater distinctness, by the application to\r\nthe back of the mirror of a layer of gold.[1054]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—EGYPTIAN SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of Egypt stain their silver vessels, that they may see\r\nrepresented in them their god Anubis;[1055] and it is the custom\r\nwith them to paint,[1056] and not to chase, their silver. This usage\r\nhas now passed to our own triumphal statues even; and, a truly\r\nmarvellous fact, the value of silver has been enhanced by deadening its\r\nbrilliancy.[1057] The following is the method adopted: with the silver\r\nare mixed two-thirds of the very finest Cyprian copper, that known as\r\n“coronarium,”[1058] and a proportion of live sulphur equal to that of\r\nthe silver. The whole of these are then melted in an earthen vessel\r\nwell luted with potter’s clay, the operation being completed when the\r\ncover becomes detached from the vessel. Silver admits also of being\r\nblackened with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; a tint, however, which is\r\nremoved by the application of vinegar and chalk.\r\n\r\nThe Triumvir Antonius alloyed the silver denarius with iron: and in\r\nspurious coin there is an alloy of copper employed. Some, again,\r\ncurtail[1059] the proper weight of our denarii, the legitimate\r\nproportion being eighty-four denarii to a pound of silver. It was in\r\nconsequence of these frauds that a method was devised of assaying the\r\ndenarius: the law ordaining which was so much to the taste of the\r\nplebeians, that in every quarter of the City there was a full-length\r\nstatue erected[1060] in honour of Marius Gratidianus. It is truly\r\nmarvellous, that in this art, and in this only, the various methods\r\nof falsification should be made a study:[1061] for the sample of the\r\nfalse denarius is now an object of careful examination, and people\r\nabsolutely buy the counterfeit coin at the price of many genuine ones!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47. (10.)—INSTANCES OF IMMENSE WEALTH. PERSONS WHO HAVE POSSESSED\r\nTHE GREATEST SUMS OF MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients bad no number whereby to express a larger sum than one\r\nhundred thousand; and hence it is that, at the present day, we reckon\r\nby multiples of that number, as, for instance, ten times one hundred\r\nthousand, and so on.[1062] For these multiplications we are indebted\r\nto usury and the use of coined money; and hence, too, the expression\r\n“æs alienum,” or “another man’s money,” which we still use.[1063] In\r\nlater times, again, the surname “Dives”[1064] was given to some: only\r\nbe it known to all, that the man who first received this surname became\r\na bankrupt and so bubbled his creditors.[1065] M. Crassus,[1066] a\r\nmember of the same family, used to say that no man was rich, who could\r\nnot maintain a legion upon his yearly income. He possessed in land two\r\nhundred millions[1067] of sesterces, being the richest Roman citizen\r\nnext to Sylla. Nor was even this enough for him, but he must want to\r\npossess all the gold of the Parthians too![1068] And yet, although he\r\nwas the first to become memorable for his opulence—so pleasant is the\r\ntask of stigmatizing this insatiate cupidity—we have known of many\r\nmanumitted slaves, since his time, much more wealthy than he ever was;\r\nthree for example, all at the same time, in the reign of the Emperor\r\nClaudius, Pallas,[1069] Callistus,[1070] and Narcissus.[1071]\r\n\r\nBut to omit all further mention of these men, as though they were\r\nstill[1072] the rulers of the empire, let us turn to C. Cæcilius\r\nClaudius Isidorus, who, in the consulship of C. Asinius Gallus and\r\nC. Marcius Censorinus,[1073] upon the sixth day before the calends\r\nof February, declared by his will, that though he had suffered great\r\nlosses through the civil wars, he was still able to leave behind him\r\nfour thousand one hundred and sixteen slaves, three thousand six\r\nhundred pairs of oxen, and two hundred and fifty-seven thousand heads\r\nof other kind of cattle, besides, in ready money, sixty millions of\r\nsesterces. Upon his funeral, also, he ordered eleven hundred thousand\r\nsesterces to be expended.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, supposing all these enormous riches to be added together,\r\nhow small a proportion will they bear to the wealth of Ptolemæus; the\r\nperson who, according to Varro, when Pompeius was on his expedition\r\nin the countries adjoining Judæa, entertained eight thousand horsemen\r\nat his own expense, and gave a repast to one thousand guests, setting\r\nbefore every one of them a drinking-cup of gold, and changing these\r\nvessels at every course! And then, again, how insignificant would his\r\nwealth have been by the side of that of Pythius the Bithynian[1074]—for\r\nI here make no mention of kings, be it remarked. He it was who gave\r\nthe celebrated plane-tree and vine of gold to King Darius, and who\r\nentertained at a banquet the troops of Xerxes, seven hundred and\r\neighty-eight thousand men in all; with a promise of pay and corn for\r\nthe whole of them during the next five months, on condition that one at\r\nleast of his five children, who had been drawn for service, should be\r\nleft to him as the solace of his old age. And yet, let any one compare\r\nthe wealth of Pythius to that possessed by King Crœsus!\r\n\r\nIn the name of all that is unfortunate, what madness it is for human\r\nnature to centre its desires upon a thing that has either fallen to the\r\nlot of slaves, or else has reached no known limit in the aspirations\r\neven of kings!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—AT WHAT PERIOD THE ROMAN PEOPLE FIRST MADE VOLUNTARY\r\nCONTRIBUTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman people first began to make voluntary contributions[1075] in\r\nthe consulship of Spurius Posthumius and Quintus Marcius.[1076] So\r\nabundant was money at that period, that the people assessed themselves\r\nfor a contribution to L. Scipio, to defray the expenses of the games\r\nwhich he celebrated.[1077] As to the contribution of the sixth part of\r\nan as, for the purpose of defraying the funeral expenses of Agrippa\r\nMenenius, I look upon that to have been a mark of respect paid to him,\r\nan honour, too, that was rendered necessary by his poverty, rather than\r\nin the light of a largess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49. (11.)—INSTANCES OF LUXURY IN SILVER PLATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caprice of the human mind is marvellously exemplified in the\r\nvarying fashions of silver plate; the work of no individual manufactory\r\nbeing for any long time in vogue. At one period, the Furnian plate,\r\nat another the Clodian, and at another the Gratian,[1078] is all the\r\nrage—for we borrow the shop even at our tables.[1079]—Now again, it\r\nis embossed plate[1080] that we are in search of, and silver deeply\r\nchiselled around the marginal lines of the figures painted[1081] upon\r\nit; and now we are building up on our sideboards fresh tiers[1082] of\r\ntables for supporting the various dishes. Other articles of plate we\r\nnicely pare away,[1083] it being an object that the file may remove as\r\nmuch of the metal as possible.\r\n\r\nWe find the orator Calvus complaining that the saucepans are made of\r\nsilver; but it has been left for us to invent a plan of covering our\r\nvery carriages[1084] with chased silver, and it was in our own age that\r\nPoppæa, the wife of the Emperor Nero, ordered her favourite mules to be\r\nshod even with gold!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—INSTANCES OF THE FRUGALITY OF THE ANCIENTS IN REFERENCE TO\r\nSILVER PLATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe younger Scipio Africanus left to his heir thirty-two pounds’ weight\r\nof silver; the same person who, on his triumph over the Carthaginians,\r\ndisplayed four thousand three hundred and seventy pounds’ weight of\r\nthat metal. Such was the sum total of the silver possessed by the\r\nwhole of the inhabitants of Carthage, that rival of Rome for the\r\nempire of the world! How many a Roman since then has surpassed her\r\nin his display of plate for a single table! After the destruction\r\nof Numantia, the same Africanus gave to his soldiers, on the day of\r\nhis triumph, a largess of seven denarii each—and right worthy were\r\nthey of such a general, when satisfied with such a sum! His brother,\r\nScipio Allobrogicus,[1085] was the very first who possessed one\r\nthousand pounds’ weight of silver, but Drusus Livius, when he was\r\ntribune of the people, possessed ten thousand. As to the fact that an\r\nancient warrior,[1086] a man, too, who had enjoyed a triumph, should\r\nhave incurred the notice of the censor for being in possession of\r\nfive pounds’ weight of silver, it is a thing that would appear quite\r\nfabulous at the present day.[1087] The same, too, with the instance of\r\nCatus Ælius,[1088] who, when consul, after being found by the Ætolian\r\nambassadors taking his morning meal[1089] off of common earthenware,\r\nrefused to receive the silver vessels which they sent him; and,\r\nindeed, was never in possession, to the last day of his life, of any\r\nsilver at all, with the exception of two drinking-cups, which had been\r\npresented to him as the reward of his valour, by L. Paulus,[1090] his\r\nfather-in-law, on the conquest of King Perseus.\r\n\r\nWe read, too, that the Carthaginian ambassadors declared that no people\r\nlived on more amicable terms among themselves than the Romans, for that\r\nwherever they had dined they had always met with the same[1091] silver\r\nplate. And yet, by Hercules! to my own knowledge, Pompeius Paulinus,\r\nson of a Roman of equestrian rank at Arelate,[1092] a member, too, of a\r\nfamily, on the paternal side, that was graced with the fur,[1093] had\r\nwith him, when serving with the army, and that, too, in a war against\r\nthe most savage nations, a service of silver plate that weighed twelve\r\nthousand pounds!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER WAS FIRST USED AS AN ORNAMENT FOR\r\nCOUCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this long time past, however, it has been the fashion to plate the\r\ncouches of our women, as well as some of our banquetting-couches,[1094]\r\nentirely with silver. Carvilius Pollio,[1095] a Roman of equestrian\r\nrank, was the first, it is said, to adorn these last with silver; not,\r\nI mean, to plate them all over, nor yet to make them after the Delian\r\npattern; the Punic[1096] fashion being the one he adopted. It was\r\nafter this last pattern too, that he had them ornamented with gold as\r\nwell: and it was not long after his time that silver couches came into\r\nfashion, in imitation of the couches of Delos. All this extravagance,\r\nhowever, was fully expiated by the civil wars of Sulla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—AT WHAT PERIOD SILVER CHARGERS OF ENORMOUS SIZE WERE FIRST\r\nMADE. WHEN SILVER WAS FIRST USED AS A MATERIAL FOR SIDEBOARDS. WHEN THE\r\nSIDEBOARDS CALLED TYMPANA WERE FIRST INTRODUCED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, it was but very shortly before that period that these couches\r\nwere invented, as well as chargers[1097] of silver, one hundred pounds\r\nin weight: of which last, it is a well-known fact, that there were then\r\nupwards of one hundred and fifty in Rome, and that many persons were\r\nproscribed through the devices of others who were desirous to gain\r\npossession thereof. Well may our Annals be put to the blush for having\r\nto impute those civil wars to the existence of such vices as these!\r\n\r\nOur own age, however, has waxed even stronger in this respect. In\r\nthe reign of Claudius, his slave Drusillanus, surnamed Rotundus, who\r\nacted as his steward[1098] in Nearer Spain, possessed a silver charger\r\nweighing five hundred pounds, for the manufacture of which a workshop\r\nhad had to be expressly built. This charger was accompanied also by\r\neight other dishes, each two hundred and fifty pounds in weight. How\r\nmany of his fellow-slaves,[1099] pray, would it have taken to introduce\r\nthese dishes, or who[1100] were to be the guests served therefrom?\r\n\r\nCornelius Nepos says that before the victory gained[1101] by Sylla,\r\nthere were but two banquetting couches adorned with silver at Rome,\r\nand that in his own recollection, silver was first used for adorning\r\nsideboards. Fenestella, who died at the end of the reign of Tiberius\r\nCæsar, informs us that at that period sideboards, inlaid even with\r\ntortoiseshell,[1102] had come into fashion; whereas, a little before\r\nhis time, they had been made of solid wood, of a round shape, and\r\nnot much larger than our tables. He says, however, that when he\r\nwas quite a boy, they had begun to make the sideboards square, and\r\nof different[1103] pieces of wood, or else veneered with maple or\r\ncitrus:[1104] and that at a later period the fashion was introduced\r\nof overlaying the corners and the seams at the joinings with silver.\r\nThe name given to them in his youth, he says, was “tympana;”[1105] and\r\nit was at this period, too, that the chargers which had been known as\r\n“magides” by the ancients, first received the name of “lances,” from\r\ntheir resemblance[1106] to the scales of a balance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—THE ENORMOUS PRICE OF SILVER PLATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, only for vast quantities of plate that there is\r\nsuch a rage among mankind, but even more so, if possible, for the plate\r\nof peculiar artists: and this too, to the exculpation of our own age,\r\nhas long been the case. C. Gracchus possessed some silver dolphins,\r\nfor which he paid five thousand sesterces per pound. Lucius Crassus,\r\nthe orator, paid for two goblets chased by the hand of the artist\r\nMentor,[1107] one hundred thousand sesterces: but he confessed that for\r\nvery shame he never dared use them, as also that he had other articles\r\nof plate in his possession, for which he had paid at the rate of six\r\nthousand sesterces per pound. It was the conquest of Asia[1108] that\r\nfirst introduced luxury into Italy; for we find that Lucius Scipio,\r\nin his triumphal procession, exhibited one thousand four hundred\r\npounds’ weight of chased silver, with golden vessels, the weight of\r\nwhich amounted to one thousand five hundred pounds. This[1109] took\r\nplace in the year from the foundation of the City, 565. But that which\r\ninflicted a still more severe blow upon the Roman morals, was the\r\nlegacy of Asia,[1110] which King Attalus[1111] left to the state at\r\nhis decease, a legacy which was even more disadvantageous than the\r\nvictory of Scipio,[1112] in its results. For, upon this occasion, all\r\nscruple was entirely removed, by the eagerness which existed at Rome,\r\nfor making purchases at the auction of the king’s effects. This took\r\nplace in the year of the City, 622, the people having learned, during\r\nthe fifty-seven years that had intervened, not only to admire, but to\r\ncovet even, the opulence of foreign nations. The tastes of the Roman\r\npeople had received, too, an immense impulse from the conquest of\r\nAchaia,[1113] which, during this interval, in the year of the City,\r\n608, that nothing might be wanting, had introduced both statues and\r\npictures. The same epoch, too, that saw the birth of luxury, witnessed\r\nthe downfall of Carthage; so that, by a fatal coincidence, the Roman\r\npeople, at the same moment, both acquired a taste for vice and obtained\r\na license for gratifying it.\r\n\r\nSome, too, of the ancients sought to recommend themselves by this love\r\nof excess; for Caius Marius, after his victory over the Cimbri, drank\r\nfrom a cantharus,[1114] it is said, in imitation of Father Liber;[1115]\r\nMarius, that ploughman[1116] of Arpinum, a general who had risen from\r\nthe ranks![1117]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54. (12.)—STATUES OF SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed, but erroneously, that silver was first\r\nemployed for making statues of the deified Emperor Augustus, at a\r\nperiod when adulation was all the fashion: for I find it stated, that\r\nin the triumph celebrated by Pompeius Magnus there was a silver statue\r\nexhibited of Pharnaces, the first[1118] king of Pontus, as also one of\r\nMithridates Eupator,[1119] besides chariots of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nSilver, too, has in some instances even supplanted gold; for the\r\nluxurious tastes of the female plebeians having gone so far as\r\nto adopt the use of shoe-buckles of gold,[1120] it is considered\r\nold-fashioned to wear them made of that metal.[1121] I myself, too,\r\nhave seen Arellius Fuscus[1122]—the person whose name was erased\r\nfrom the equestrian order on a singularly calumnious charge,[1123]\r\nwhen his school was so thronged by our youth, attracted thither by\r\nhis celebrity—wearing rings made of silver. But of what use is it to\r\ncollect all these instances, when our very soldiers, holding ivory even\r\nin contempt, have the hilts of their swords made of chased silver?\r\nwhen, too, their scabbards are heard to jingle with their silver\r\nchains, and their belts with the plates of silver with which they are\r\ninlaid?\r\n\r\nAt the present day, too, the continence of our very pages is secured\r\nby the aid of silver:[1124] our women, when bathing, quite despise any\r\nsitting-bath that is not made of silver: while for serving up food at\r\ntable, as well as for the most unseemly purposes, the same metal must\r\nbe equally employed! Would that Fabricius could behold these instances\r\nof luxuriousness, the baths of our women—bathing as they do in company\r\nwith the men—paved with silver to such an extent that there is not room\r\nleft for the sole of the foot even! Fabricius, I say, who would allow\r\nof no general of an army having any other plate than a patera and a\r\nsalt-cellar of silver.—Oh that he could see how that the rewards of\r\nvalour in our day are either composed of these objects of luxury, or\r\nelse are broken up to make them![1125] Alas for the morals of our age!\r\nFabricius puts us to the blush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—THE MOST REMARKABLE WORKS IN SILVER, AND THE NAMES OF THE\r\nMOST FAMOUS ARTISTS IN SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that the art of chasing gold should have\r\nconferred no celebrity upon any person, while that of embossing silver\r\nhas rendered many illustrious. The greatest renown, however, has been\r\nacquired by Mentor, of whom mention has been made already.[1126] Four\r\npairs [of vases] were all that were ever[1127] made by him; and at the\r\npresent day, not one of these, it is said, is any longer in existence,\r\nowing to the conflagrations of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus and\r\nof that in the Capitol.[1128] Varro informs us in his writings that\r\nhe also was in possession of a bronze statue, the work of this\r\nartist. Next to Mentor, the most admired artists were Acragas,[1129]\r\nBoëthus,[1130] and Mys.[1131] Works of all these artists are still\r\nextant in the Isle of Rhodes; of Boëthus, in the Temple of Minerva,\r\nat Lindus; of Acragas, in the Temple of Father Liber, at Rhodes,\r\nconsisting of cups engraved with figures in relief of Centaurs and\r\nBacchantes; and of Mys, in the same temple, figures of Sileni and\r\nCupids. Representations also of the chase by Acragas on drinking cups\r\nwere held in high estimation.\r\n\r\nNext to these in repute comes Calamis.[1132] Antipater[1133] too, it\r\nhas been said, laid, rather than engraved,[1134] a Sleeping Satyr\r\nupon a drinking-bowl.[1135] Next to these come Stratonicus[1136] of\r\nCyzicus, and Tauriscus:[1137] Ariston[1138] also, and Eunicus,[1139]\r\nof Mytilene are highly praised; Hecatæus[1140] also, and, about the\r\nage of Pompeius Magnus, Pasiteles,[1141] Posidonius[1142] of Ephesus,\r\nHedystratides[1143] who engraved battle-scenes and armed warriors,\r\nand Zopyrus,[1144] who represented the Court of the Areopagus and\r\nthe trial of Orestes,[1145] upon two cups valued at twelve thousand\r\nsesterces. There was Pytheas[1146] also, a work of whose sold at the\r\nrate of ten thousand denarii for two ounces: it was a drinking-bowl,\r\nthe figures on which represented Ulysses and Diomedes stealing the\r\nPalladium.[1147] The same artist engraved also, upon some small\r\ndrinking-vessels, kitchen scenes,[1148] known as “magiriscia;”[1149]\r\nof such remarkably fine workmanship and so liable to injury, that it\r\nwas quite impossible to take copies[1150] of them. Teucer too, the\r\ninlayer,[1151] enjoyed a great reputation.\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, this art became so lost in point of excellence,\r\nthat at the present day ancient specimens are the only ones at all\r\nvalued; and only those pieces of plate are held in esteem the designs\r\non which are so much worn that the figures cannot be distinguished.\r\n\r\nSilver becomes tainted by the contact of mineral waters, and of the\r\nsalt exhalations from them, as in the interior of Spain, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—SIL: THE PERSONS WHO FIRST USED IT IN PAINTING, AND THE\r\nMETHOD THEY ADOPTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mines of gold and silver there are some other pigments also\r\nfound, sil[1152] and cæruleum. Sil is, properly speaking, a sort of\r\nslime.[1153] The best kind is that known as Attic sil; the price of\r\nwhich is two denarii per pound. The next best kind is the marbled[1154]\r\nsil, the price of which is half that of the Attic kind. A third sort\r\nis the compressed sil, known to some persons as Scyric sil, it coming\r\nfrom the Isle of Scyros. Then, too, there is the sil of Achaia, which\r\npainters make use of for shadow-painting, and the price of which is two\r\nsesterces per pound. At a price of two asses less per pound, is sold\r\nthe clear[1155] sil, which comes from Gaul. This last kind, as well\r\nas the Attic sil, is used for painting strong lights: but the marbled\r\nsil only is employed for colouring compartitions,[1156] the marble in\r\nit offering a resistance to the natural acridity of the lime. This last\r\nkind is extracted also from some mountains twenty miles distant from\r\nthe City. When thus extracted, it is submitted to the action of fire;\r\nin which form it is adulterated by some, and sold for compressed sil.\r\nThat it has been burnt, however, and adulterated, may be very easily\r\ndetected by its acridity, and the fact that it very soon crumbles into\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nPolygnotus[1157] and Micon[1158] were the first to employ sil in\r\npainting, but that of Attica solely. The succeeding age used this last\r\nkind for strong lights only, and employed the Scyric and Lydian kinds\r\nfor shadow painting. The Lydian sil used to be bought at Sardes; but at\r\nthe present day we hear nothing of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (13.)—CÆRULEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCæruleum[1159] is a kind of sand. In former times there were three\r\nkinds of it; the Egyptian, which was the most esteemed of all; the\r\nScythian, which is easily dissolved, and which produces four colours\r\nwhen pounded, one of a lighter blue and one of a darker blue, one of a\r\nthicker consistency and one comparatively thin;[1160] and the Cyprian,\r\nwhich is now preferred as a colour to the preceding. Since then, the\r\nkinds imported from Puteoli and Spain have been added to the list, this\r\nsand having of late been prepared there. Every kind,[1161] however,\r\nis submitted to a dyeing process, it being boiled with a plant[1162]\r\nused particularly for this purpose,[1163] and imbibing its juices.\r\nIn other respects, the mode of preparing it is similar to that of\r\nchrysocolla. From cæruleum, too, is prepared the substance known as\r\n“lomentum,”[1164] it being washed and ground for the purpose. Lomentum\r\nis of a paler tint than cæruleum; the price of it is ten denarii per\r\npound, and that of cæruleum but eight. Cæruleum is used upon a surface\r\nof clay, for upon lime it will not hold. A more recent invention is\r\nthe Vestorian[1165] cæruleum, so called from the person who first\r\nmanufactured it: it is prepared from the finer parts of Egyptian\r\ncæruleum, and the price of it is eleven denarii per pound. That of\r\nPuteoli is used in a similar manner,[1166] as also for windows:[1167]\r\nit is known as “cylon.”\r\n\r\nIt is not so long since that indicum[1168] was first imported to Rome,\r\nthe price being seventeen[1169] denarii per pound. Painters make use\r\nof it for incisures, or in other words, the division of shadows from\r\nlight. There is also a lomentum of very inferior quality, known to us\r\nas “ground” lomentum, and valued at only five asses per pound.\r\n\r\nThe mode of testing the genuineness of cæruleum, is to see whether\r\nit emits a flame, on being laid upon burning coals. One method of\r\nadulterating it is to boil dried violets in water, and then to strain\r\nthe liquor through linen into Eretrian[1170] clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—TWO REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CÆRULEUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCæruleum has the medicinal property of acting as a detergent upon\r\nulcers. Hence it is, that it is used as an ingredient in plasters,\r\nas also in cauteries. As to sil, it is pounded with the greatest\r\ndifficulty: viewed as a medicament, it is slightly mordent and\r\nastringent, and fills up the cavities left by ulcers. To make it the\r\nmore serviceable, it is burnt in earthen vessels.\r\n\r\nThe prices of things, which I have in different places annexed,\r\nvary, I am well aware, according to the locality, and experience a\r\nchange almost every year: variations dependent upon the opportunities\r\nafforded for navigation, and the terms upon which the merchant may\r\nhave purchased the article. It may so happen, too, that some wealthy\r\ndealer has engrossed the market, and so enhanced the price: for I am\r\nby no means forgetful of the case of Demetrius, who in the reign of\r\nthe Emperor Nero was accused before the consuls by the whole community\r\nof the Seplasia.[1171] Still, however, I have thought it necessary to\r\nannex the usual price of each commodity at Rome, in order to give some\r\nidea of their relative values.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remedies, narratives, and observations, one thousand one\r\nhundred and twenty-five.\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Domitianus Cæsar,[1172] Junius Gracchanus,[1173]\r\nL.

(1.)—THE ORES OF BRASS.[1215]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must, in the next place, give an account of the ores of brass,[1216]\r\na metal which, in respect of utility, is next in value; indeed the\r\nCorinthian brass comes before silver, not to say almost before gold\r\nitself. It is also, as I have stated above,[1217] the standard of\r\nmonetary value;[1218] hence the terms “æra militum,” “tribuni ærarii,”\r\n“ærarium,” “obærati,” and “ære diruti.”[1219] I have already mentioned\r\nfor what length of time the Roman people employed no coin except\r\nbrass;[1220] and there is another ancient fact which proves that the\r\nesteem in which it was held was of equal antiquity with that of the\r\nCity itself, the circumstance that the third associated body[1221]\r\nwhich Numa established, was that of the braziers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ore is extracted in the mode that has been described above,[1222]\r\nand is then purified by fusion. The metal is also obtained from a\r\ncoppery stone called “cadmia.”[1223] The most highly esteemed copper is\r\nprocured from beyond seas: it was formerly obtained in Campania also,\r\nand at present is found in the country of the Bergomates,[1224] at the\r\nextremity of Italy. It is said to have been lately discovered also in\r\nthe province of Germany.\r\n\r\n(2.) In Cyprus, where copper was first discovered, it is also procured\r\nfrom another stone, which is called “chalcitis.”[1225] This, however,\r\nwas afterwards considered of little value, a better kind having been\r\nfound in other regions, especially that called “aurichalcum,”[1226]\r\nwhich was long in high request, on account of its excellent\r\nquality; but none of it has been found for this long time, the\r\nearth having been quite exhausted. The kind which was next in value\r\nwas the Sallustian,[1227] procured from the Alpine district of the\r\nCentrones;[1228] but this did not last long, and was succeeded by the\r\nLivian, in Gaul. They both took their names from the owners of the\r\nmines; the former a friend of the Emperor Augustus, the latter that\r\nemperor’s wife.[1229] They soon failed, however, and in the Livian even\r\nthere is now found but a very small quantity of ore. That which is at\r\npresent held in the highest estimation is the Marian, likewise known as\r\nthe Corduban;[1230] next to the Livian, this kind most readily absorbs\r\ncadmia, and becomes almost as excellent as aurichalcum[1231] for making\r\nsesterces and double asses,[1232] the Cyprian copper being thought good\r\nenough for the as. Thus much concerning the natural qualities of this\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—THE CORINTHIAN BRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other kinds are made artificially, all of which will be described\r\nin the appropriate places, the more celebrated kinds first coming\r\nunder our notice. Formerly a mixture was made of copper fused with\r\ngold and silver, and the workmanship in this metal was considered even\r\nmore valuable than the material itself; but, at the present day, it\r\nis difficult to say whether the workmanship in it, or the material,\r\nis the worst. Indeed, it is wonderful, that while the value of these\r\nworks[1233] has so infinitely increased, the reputation of the art\r\nitself[1234] is nearly extinct. But it would appear, that in this, as\r\nin every thing else, what was formerly done for the sake of reputation,\r\nis now undertaken for the mere purpose of gain. For whereas this art\r\nwas ascribed to the gods[1235] themselves, and men of rank in all\r\ncountries endeavoured to acquire fame by the practice of it, we have\r\nnow so entirely lost the method of making this valuable compound by\r\nfusion, that, for this long time past, not even chance itself has\r\nassumed, in this department, the privilege which formerly belonged to\r\nart.[1236]\r\n\r\nNext after the above compound, so celebrated in antiquity, the\r\nCorinthian metal has been the most highly esteemed. This was a\r\ncompound produced by accident, when Corinth was burnt at the time of\r\nits capture.[1237] There has been a wonderful mania with many for\r\ngaining possession of this metal. It is even said, that Verres, whom M.\r\nCicero caused to be condemned, was proscribed by Antonius, along with\r\nCicero, for no other reason than his refusal to give up some specimens\r\nof Corinthian metal, which were in his possession. But most of these\r\npeople seem to me to make a pretence of their discernment in reference\r\nto this metal, rather for the purpose of distinguishing themselves from\r\nthe multitude, than from any real knowledge which they possess; and\r\nthis I will briefly show.\r\n\r\nCorinth was captured in the third year of the 158th Olympiad, being\r\nthe year of the City, 608,[1238] some ages after the period when those\r\nartists flourished, who produced all the specimens of what these\r\npersons now call Corinthian metal. It is in order, therefore, to\r\nrefute this opinion, that I shall state the age when these different\r\nartists lived; for, if we reckon according to the above-mentioned era\r\nof the Olympiads, it will be easy to compare their dates with the\r\ncorresponding years of our City. The only genuine Corinthian vessels,\r\nthen, are those which these men of taste metamorphose, sometimes\r\ninto dishes, sometimes into lamps, or even into washing-basins,[1239]\r\nwithout any regard to decency. They are of three kinds; the white\r\nvariety, approaching very nearly to the splendour of silver, and in\r\nwhich that metal forms a large proportion of the compound; a second\r\nkind, in which the yellow colour of gold predominates; and a third, in\r\nwhich all the metals are mixed in equal proportions. Besides these,\r\nthere is another mixture, the composition of which it is impossible\r\nto describe, for although it has been formed into images and statues\r\nby the hand of man, it is chance that rules in the formation of the\r\ncompound. This last is highly prized for its colour, which approaches\r\nto that of liver, and it is on this account that it is called\r\n“hepatizon:”[1240] it is far inferior to the Corinthian metal, but much\r\nsuperior to the Æginetan and Delian, which long held the first rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—THE DELIAN BRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Delian brass was the first[1241] that became famous, all the\r\nworld coming to Delos to purchase it; and hence the attention paid\r\nto the manufacture of it. It was in this island that brass first\r\nobtained celebrity for the manufacture of the feet and supports of\r\ndining-couches. After some time it came to be employed for the statues\r\nof the gods, and the effigies of men and other animated beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—THE ÆGINETAN BRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next most esteemed brass was the Æginetan; the island itself\r\nbeing rendered famous for its brass—not indeed that the metal was\r\nproduced there, but because the annealing of the Æginetan manufactories\r\nwas so excellent. A brazen Ox, which was taken from this island,\r\nnow stands in the Forum Boarium[1242] at Rome. This is a specimen\r\nof the Æginetan metal, as the Jupiter in the Temple of Jupiter\r\nTonans, in the Capitol, is of the Delian. Myron[1243] used the former\r\nmetal and Polycletus[1244] the latter; they were contemporaries and\r\nfellow-pupils, but there was great rivalry between them as to their\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6. (3.)—STANDS FOR LAMPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆgina was particularly famous for the manufacture of sockets only for\r\nlamp-stands, as Tarentum was for that of the branches;[1245] the most\r\ncomplete articles were, therefore, produced by the union of the two.\r\nThere are persons, too, who are not ashamed to give for one a sum\r\nequal to the salary of a military tribune,[1246] although, as its name\r\nindicates, its only use is to hold a lighted candle. On the sale of\r\none of these lamp-stands, Theon the public crier announced, that the\r\npurchaser must also take, as part of the lot, one Clesippus, a fuller,\r\nwho was hump-backed, and in other respects, of a hideous aspect. The\r\npurchase was made by a female named[1247] Gegania, for fifty thousand\r\nsesterces. Upon her exhibiting these purchases at an entertainment\r\nwhich she gave, the slave, for the amusement of her guests, was brought\r\nin naked. Conceiving an infamous passion for him, she first admitted\r\nhim to her bed, and finally left him all her estate. Having thus become\r\nexcessively rich, he adored the lamp-stand as much as any divinity, and\r\nthe story became a sort of pendant to the celebrity of the Corinthian\r\nlamp-stands. Still, however, good morals were vindicated in the end,\r\nfor he erected a splendid monument to her memory, and so kept alive\r\nthe eternal remembrance of the misconduct of Gegania. But although it\r\nis well known that there are no lamp-stands in existence made of the\r\nCorinthian metal, yet this name is very generally attached to them,\r\nbecause, in consequence of the victory of Mummius,[1248] Corinth was\r\ndestroyed: at the same time, however, it should be remembered that this\r\nvictory dispersed a number of bronzes which originally came from many\r\nother cities of Achaia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—ORNAMENTS OF THE TEMPLES MADE OF BRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients were in the habit of making the door-sills and even the\r\ndoors of the temples of brass. I find it stated, also, that Cneius\r\nOctavius, who obtained a naval triumph over King Perseus,[1249]\r\nerected the double portico to the Flaminian Circus, which was called\r\nthe “Corinthian” from the brazen capitals of the pillars.[1250] It is\r\nstated also, that an ordinance was made that the Temple of Vesta[1251]\r\nshould be covered with a coating of Syracusan metal. The capitals, too,\r\nof the pillars, which were placed by M. Agrippa in the Pantheon, are\r\nmade of similar metal. Even the opulence, too, of private individuals\r\nhas been wrested to similar purposes. Spurius Carvilius, the quæstor,\r\namong the other charges which he brought against Camillus,[1252]\r\naccused him of having brazen doors in his house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—COUCHES OF BRASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe learn from L. Piso,[1253] that Cneius Manlius was the first who\r\nintroduced brazen banquetting-couches, buffets, and tables with\r\nsingle feet,[1254] when he entered the City in triumph, in the\r\nyear of Rome 567, after his conquests in Asia. We also learn from\r\nAntias,[1255] that the heirs of L. Crassus, the orator, sold a number\r\nof banquetting-couches adorned with brass. The tripods,[1256] which\r\nwere called Delphian, because they were devoted more particularly to\r\nreceiving the offerings that were presented to the Delphian Apollo,\r\nwere usually made of brass: also the pendant lamps,[1257] so much\r\nadmired, which were placed in the temples, or gave their light in the\r\nform of trees loaded with fruit; such as the one, for instance, in the\r\nTemple of the Palatine Apollo,[1258] which Alexander the Great, at the\r\nsacking of Thebes, brought to Cyme,[1259] and dedicated to that god.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9. (4.)—WHICH WAS THE FIRST STATUE OF A GOD MADE OF BRASS AT\r\nROME. THE ORIGIN OF STATUES, AND THE RESPECT PAID TO THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut after some time the artists everywhere applied themselves to\r\nrepresentations of the gods. I find that the first brass image, which\r\nwas made at Rome, was that of Ceres; and that the expenses were\r\ndefrayed out of the property that belonged to Spurius Cassius, who was\r\nput to death by his own father, for aspiring to the regal office.[1260]\r\nThe practice, however, soon passed from the gods to the statues and\r\nrepresentations of men, and this in various forms. The ancients stained\r\ntheir statues with bitumen, which makes it the more remarkable that\r\nthey were afterwards fond of covering them with gold. I do not know\r\nwhether this was a Roman invention; but it certainly has the repute of\r\nbeing an ancient practice at Rome.\r\n\r\nIt was not the custom in former times to give the likeness of\r\nindividuals, except of such as deserved to be held in lasting\r\nremembrance on account of some illustrious deed; in the first instance,\r\nfor a victory at the sacred games, and more particularly the Olympic\r\nGames, where it was the usage for the victors always to have their\r\nstatues consecrated. And if any one was so fortunate as to obtain\r\nthe prize there three times, his statue was made with the exact\r\nresemblance of every individual limb; from which circumstance they were\r\ncalled “iconicæ.”[1261] I do not know whether the first public statues\r\nwere not erected by the Athenians, and in honour of Harmodius and\r\nAristogiton, who slew the tyrant;[1262] an event which took place in\r\nthe same year in which the kings were expelled from Rome. This custom,\r\nfrom a most praiseworthy emulation, was afterwards adopted by all other\r\nnations; so that statues were erected as ornaments in the public places\r\nof municipal towns, and the memory of individuals was thus preserved,\r\ntheir various honours being inscribed on the pedestals, to be read\r\nthere by posterity, and not on their tombs alone. After some time, a\r\nkind of forum or public place came to be made in private houses and in\r\nour halls, the clients adopting this method of doing honour to their\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (5.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS AND FORMS OF STATUES. STATUES AT\r\nROME WITH CUIRASSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn former times the statues that were thus dedicated were clad in the\r\ntoga.[1263] Naked statues also, brandishing a spear, after the manner\r\nof the youths at their gymnastic exercises, were much admired; these\r\nwere called “Achillean.” The Greek practice is, not to cover any part\r\nof the body; while, on the contrary, the Roman and the military statues\r\nhave the addition of a cuirass. Cæsar, the Dictator, permitted a statue\r\nwith a cuirass to be erected in honour of him in his Forum.[1264]\r\nAs to the statues which are made in the garb of the Luperci,[1265]\r\nthey are of no older date than those which have been lately erected,\r\ncovered with a cloak.[1266] Mancinus gave directions, that he should\r\nbe represented in the dress which he wore when he was surrendered\r\nto the enemy.[1267] It has been remarked by some authors, that L.\r\nAttius,[1268] the poet, had a statue of himself erected in the Temple\r\nof the Muses,[1269] which was extremely large, although he himself was\r\nvery short.\r\n\r\nEquestrian statues are also held in esteem in Rome; but they are of\r\nGreek origin, no doubt. Among the Greeks, those persons only were\r\nhonoured with equestrian statues who were victors on horseback[1270] in\r\nthe sacred games; though afterwards the same distinction was bestowed\r\non those who were successful in the races with chariots with two or\r\nfour horses: hence the use of chariots with us in the statues of those\r\nwho have triumphed. But this did not take place until a late period;\r\nand it was not until the time of the late Emperor Augustus, that we had\r\nchariots represented with six horses,[1271] as also with elephants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—IN HONOUR OF WHOM PUBLIC STATUES WERE FIRST ERECTED: IN\r\nHONOUR OF WHOM THEY WERE FIRST PLACED ON PILLARS: WHEN THE ROSTRA WERE\r\nFIRST ERECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe custom of erecting chariots with two horses in honour of those who\r\nhad discharged the office of prætor, and had passed round the Circus in\r\na chariot, is not of ancient date. That of placing statues on pillars\r\nis older, as it was done in honour of C. Mænius,[1272] who conquered\r\nthe ancient Latins, to whom the Romans by treaty gave one third of the\r\nspoil which they had obtained. It was in the same consulship also,\r\nthat the “rostra” or beaks of the ships, which had been taken from\r\nthe Antiates when vanquished, were fixed to the tribunal; it being\r\nthe year of the City, 416.[1273] The same thing was done also by\r\nCaius Duillius, who was the first to obtain a naval triumph over the\r\nCarthaginians: his column still remains in the Forum.[1274] I am not\r\ncertain whether this honour was not first conferred by the people on L.\r\nMinutius, the præfect of the markets; whose statue was erected without\r\nthe Trigeminian Gate,[1275] by means of a tax of the twelfth of an\r\nas[1276] per head: the same thing, however, had been previously done\r\nby the senate, and it would have been a more distinguished honour had\r\nit not had its origin on such frivolous occasions. The statue of Attus\r\nNavius,[1277] for example, was erected before the senate-house, the\r\npedestal of which was consumed when the senate-house itself was burnt\r\nat the funeral of Publius Clodius.[1278] The statue of Hermodorus also,\r\nthe Ephesian,[1279] the interpreter of the laws which were transcribed\r\nby the Decemvirs, was erected by the public in the Comitium.[1280]\r\n\r\nIt was for a very different, and more important reason, that the statue\r\nof Horatius Cocles was erected, he having singly prevented the enemy\r\nfrom passing the Sublician bridge:[1281] a statue which remains to this\r\nday. I am not at all surprized, too, that statues of the Sibyl should\r\nhave been erected near the Rostra, even though three in number; one of\r\nwhich was repaired by Sextus Pacuvius Taurus, ædile of the people, and\r\nthe other two by M. Messala. I should have considered these and that of\r\nAttus Navius to have been the oldest, as having been placed there in\r\nthe time of Tarquinius Priscus, had there not been in the Capitol the\r\nstatues of the preceding kings.[1282]\r\n\r\n(6.) Among these we have the statues of Romulus and Tatius without\r\nthe tunic; as also that of Camillus, near the Rostra. The equestrian\r\nstatue of Marcius Tremulus, clad in the toga, stood before the\r\nTemple of the Castors;[1283] him who twice subdued the Samnites,\r\nand by the capture of Anagnia delivered the people from their\r\ntribute.[1284] Among the most ancient are those of Tullus Clœlius,\r\nLucius Roscius, Spurius Nautius, and C. Fulcinus, near the Rostra, all\r\nof whom were assassinated by the Fidenates, when on their mission as\r\nambassadors.[1285] It was the custom with the republic to confer this\r\nhonour on those who had been unjustly put to death; such as P. Junius,\r\nalso, and Titus Coruncanius, who were slain by Teuta, queen of the\r\nIllyrians.[1286] It would be wrong not to mention what is stated in the\r\nAnnals, that their statues, erected in the Forum, were three feet in\r\nheight; whence it would appear that such were the dimensions of these\r\nmarks of honour in those times.\r\n\r\nNor must I forget to mention Cneius Octavius, on account of the\r\nlanguage used by the Senate.[1287] When King Antiochus said, that\r\nhe would give him an answer at another time, Octavius drew a line\r\nround him with a stick, which he happened to have in his hand, and\r\ncompelled him to give an answer before he allowed him to step beyond\r\nthe circle. Octavius being slain[1288] while on this embassy, the\r\nsenate ordered his statue to be placed in the most conspicuous[1289]\r\nspot; and that spot was the Rostra. A statue appears also to have been\r\ndecreed to Taracia Caia, or Furetia, a Vestal Virgin, the same, too,\r\nto be placed wherever she might think fit; an additional honour, no\r\nless remarkable, it is thought, than the grant itself of a statue to a\r\nfemale. I will state her merits in the words of the Annals: “Because\r\nshe had gratuitously presented to the public the field bordering on the\r\nTiber.”[1290]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—IN HONOUR OF WHAT FOREIGNERS PUBLIC STATUES WERE ERECTED AT\r\nROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nI find also, that statues were erected in honour of Pythagoras and of\r\nAlcibiades, in the corners of the Comitium; in obedience to the command\r\nof the Pythian Apollo, who, in the Samnite War,[1291] had directed\r\nthat statues of the bravest and the wisest of the Greeks should be\r\nerected in some conspicuous spot: and here they remained until Sylla,\r\nthe Dictator, built the senate-house on the site. It is wonderful\r\nthat the senate should then have preferred Pythagoras to Socrates,\r\nwho, in consequence of his wisdom, had been preferred to all other\r\nmen[1292] by the god himself; as, also, that they should have preferred\r\nAlcibiades for valour to so many other heroes; or, indeed, any one to\r\nThemistocles, who so greatly excelled in both qualities. The reason of\r\nthe statues being raised on columns, was, that the persons represented\r\nmight be elevated above other mortals; the same thing being signified\r\nby the use of arches, a new invention which had its origin among the\r\nGreeks. I am of opinion that there is no one to whom more statues were\r\nerected than to Demetrius Phalercus[1293] at Athens: for there were\r\nthree hundred and sixty erected in his honour, there being reckoned at\r\nthat period no more days in the year: these, however, were soon broken\r\nto pieces. The different tribes erected statues, in all the quarters\r\nof Rome, in honour of Marius Gratidianus, as already stated;[1294] but\r\nthey were all thrown down by Sylla, when he entered Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—THE FIRST EQUESTRIAN STATUES PUBLICLY ERECTED AT ROME, AND IN\r\nHONOUR OF WHAT FEMALES STATUES WERE PUBLICLY ERECTED THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPedestrian statues have been, undoubtedly, for a long time in\r\nestimation at Rome: equestrian statues are, however, of considerable\r\nantiquity, and females even have participated in this honour; for the\r\nstatue of Clælia is equestrian,[1295] as if it had not been thought\r\nsufficient to have her clad in the toga; and this, although statues\r\nwere not decreed to Lucretia, or to Brutus, who had expelled the kings,\r\nand through both of whom Clælia had been given as a hostage.[1296] I\r\nshould have thought that this statue, and that of Cocles, were the\r\nfirst that were erected at the public expense—for it is most likely\r\nthat the statues of Attus and the Sibyl were erected by Tarquinius, and\r\nthose of each of the other kings by themselves respectively—had not\r\nPiso stated that the statue of Clælia was erected by those who had been\r\nhostages with her, when they were given up by Porsena, as a mark of\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nBut Annius Fetialis[1297] states, on the other hand, that the\r\nequestrian statue, which stood opposite the Temple of Jupiter Stator,\r\nin the vestibule of the house of Tarquinius Superbus, was that of\r\nValeria,[1298] the daughter of the consul Publicola; and that she was\r\nthe only person that escaped and swam across the Tiber; the rest of\r\nthe hostages that had been sent to Porsena having been destroyed by a\r\nstratagem of Tarquinius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—AT WHAT PERIOD ALL THE STATUES ERECTED BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS\r\nWERE REMOVED FROM THE PUBLIC PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are informed by L. Piso, that when M. Æmilius and C. Popilius were\r\nconsuls, for the second time,[1299] the censors, P. Cornelius Scipio\r\nand M. Popilius, caused all the statues erected round the Forum in\r\nhonour of those who had borne the office of magistrates, to be removed;\r\nwith the exception of those which had been placed there, either by\r\norder of the people or of the senate. The statue also which Spurius\r\nCassius,[1300] who had aspired to the supreme authority, had erected\r\nin honour of himself, before the Temple of Tellus, was melted down by\r\norder of the censors; for even in this respect, the men of those days\r\ntook precautions against ambition.\r\n\r\nThere are still extant some declamations by Cato, during his\r\ncensorship, against the practice of erecting statues of women in the\r\nRoman provinces. However, he could not prevent these statues being\r\nerected at Rome even; to Cornelia, for instance, the mother of the\r\nGracchi, and daughter of the elder Scipio Africanus. She is represented\r\nin a sitting posture, and the statue is remarkable for having no straps\r\nto the shoes. This statue, which was formerly in the public Portico of\r\nMetellus, is now in the Buildings of Octavia.[1301]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—THE FIRST STATUES PUBLICLY ERECTED BY FOREIGNERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first statue that was erected at Rome at the expense of a foreigner\r\nwas that of C. Ælius, the tribune of the people, who had introduced\r\na law against Sthennius Statilius Lucanus,[1302] for having twice\r\nattacked Thurii: on which account the inhabitants of that place\r\npresented Ælius with a statue and a golden crown. At a later period,\r\nthe same people erected a statue to Fabricius,[1303] who had delivered\r\ntheir city from a state of siege. From time to time various nations\r\nthus placed themselves under the protection of the Romans; and all\r\ndistinctions were thereby so effectually removed, that statues of\r\nHannibal even are to be seen in three different places in that city,\r\nwithin the walls of which, he alone of all its enemies, had hurled his\r\nspear.[1304]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (7.)—THAT THERE WERE STATUARIES IN ITALY ALSO AT AN EARLY\r\nPERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances prove, that the art of making statues was\r\ncommonly practised in Italy at an early period. The statue in the\r\nCattle Market[1305] is said to have been consecrated to Hercules by\r\nEvander; it is called the triumphal Hercules, and, on the occasion of\r\ntriumphal processions, is arrayed in triumphal vestments. And then\r\nbesides, King Numa dedicated the statue of the two-faced Janus;[1306]\r\na deity who is worshipped as presiding over both peace and war. The\r\nfingers, too, are so formed as to indicate three hundred and sixty-five\r\ndays,[1307] or in other words, the year; thus denoting that he is the\r\ngod of time and duration.\r\n\r\nThere are also Etruscan statues dispersed in various parts of the\r\nworld, which beyond a doubt were originally made in Etruria. I should\r\nhave supposed that these had been the statues only of divinities,\r\nhad not Metrodorus[1308] of Scepsis, who had his surname from his\r\nhatred to the Roman name,[1309] reproached us with having pillaged the\r\ncity of Volsinii for the sake of the two thousand statues which it\r\ncontained. It appears to me a singular fact, that although the origin\r\nof statues was of such great antiquity in Italy, the images of the\r\ngods, which were consecrated to them in their temples, should have\r\nbeen formed either of wood or of earthenware,[1310] until the conquest\r\nof Asia, which introduced luxury among us. It will be the best plan\r\nto enlarge upon the origin of the art of expressing likenesses, when\r\nwe come to speak of what the Greeks call “plastice;”[1311] for the\r\nart of modelling was prior to that of statuary. This last, however,\r\nhas flourished to such an extraordinary degree, that an account of it\r\nwould fill many volumes, if we were desirous of making an extensive\r\nacquaintance with the subject: but as to learning everything connected\r\nwith it, who could do it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—THE IMMODERATE PRICES OF STATUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ædileship of M. Scaurus, there were three thousand statues\r\nerected on the stage of what was a temporary theatre[1312] only.\r\nMummius, the conqueror of Achaia, filled the City with statues; he who\r\nat his death was destined not to leave a dowry to his daughter,[1313]\r\nfor why not mention this as an apology for him? The Luculli[1314] also\r\nintroduced many articles from abroad. Yet we learn from Mucianus,[1315]\r\nwho was thrice consul, that there are still three thousand statues in\r\nRhodes, and it is supposed that there are no fewer in existence at\r\nAthens, at Olympia, and at Delphi. What living mortal could enumerate\r\nthem all? or of what utility would be such information? Still, however,\r\nI may, perhaps, afford amusement by giving some slight account of such\r\nof those works of art as are in any way remarkable, and stating the\r\nnames of the more celebrated artists. Of each of these it would be\r\nimpossible to enumerate all the productions, for Lysippus[1316] alone\r\nis said to have executed no less than fifteen hundred[1317] works of\r\nart, all of which were of such excellence that any one of them might\r\nhave immortalized him. The number was ascertained by his heir, upon\r\nopening his coffers after his death, it having been his practice to lay\r\nup one golden denarius[1318] out of the sum which he had received as\r\nthe price of each statue.\r\n\r\nThis art has arrived at incredible perfection, both in successfulness\r\nand in boldness of design. As a proof of successfulness, I will adduce\r\none example, and that of a figure which represented neither god nor\r\nman. We have seen in our own time, in the Capitol, before it was last\r\nburnt by the party[1319] of Vitellius, in the shrine of Juno there, a\r\nbronze figure of a dog licking its wounds. Its miraculous excellence\r\nand its perfect truthfulness were not only proved by the circumstance\r\nof its having been consecrated there, but also by the novel kind of\r\nsecurity that was taken for its safety; for, no sum appearing equal to\r\nits value, it was publicly enacted that the keepers of it should be\r\nanswerable for its safety with their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE MOST CELEBRATED COLOSSAL STATUES IN THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to boldness of design, the examples are innumerable; for we see\r\ndesigned, statues of enormous bulk, known as colossal statues and\r\nequal to towers in size. Such, for instance, is the Apollo in the\r\nCapitol, which was brought by M. Lucullus from Apollonia, a city of\r\nPontus,[1320] thirty cubits in height, and which cost five hundred\r\ntalents: such, too, is the statue of Jupiter, in the Campus Martius,\r\ndedicated by the late Emperor Claudius, but which appears small\r\nin comparison from its vicinity to the Theatre of Pompeius: and\r\nsuch is that at Tarentum, forty cubits in height, and the work of\r\nLysippus.[1321] It is a remarkable circumstance in this statue, that\r\nthough, as it is stated, it is so nicely balanced as to be moveable\r\nby the hand, it has never been thrown down by a tempest. This indeed,\r\nthe artist, it is said, has guarded against, by a column erected at a\r\nshort distance from it, upon the side on which the violence of the wind\r\nrequired to be broken. On account, therefore, of its magnitude, and the\r\ngreat difficulty of moving it, Fabius Verrucosus[1322] did not touch\r\nit, when he transferred the Hercules from that place to the Capitol,\r\nwhere it now stands.\r\n\r\nBut that which is by far the most worthy of our admiration, is the\r\ncolossal statue of the Sun, which stood formerly at Rhodes, and was the\r\nwork of Chares the Lindian, a pupil of the above-named Lysippus;[1323]\r\nno less than seventy cubits in height. This statue, fifty-six years\r\nafter it was erected, was thrown down by an earthquake; but even as it\r\nlies, it excites our wonder and admiration.[1324] Few men can clasp\r\nthe thumb in their arms, and its fingers are larger than most statues.\r\nWhere the limbs are broken asunder, vast caverns are seen yawning in\r\nthe interior. Within it, too, are to be seen large masses of rock, by\r\nthe weight of which the artist steadied it while erecting it. It is\r\nsaid that it was twelve years before this statue was completed, and\r\nthat three hundred talents were expended upon it; a sum raised from the\r\nengines of warfare which had been abandoned by King Demetrius,[1325]\r\nwhen tired of the long-protracted siege of Rhodes. In the same city\r\nthere are other colossal statues, one hundred in number; but though\r\nsmaller than the one already mentioned, wherever erected, they would,\r\nany one of them, have ennobled the place. In addition to these, there\r\nare five colossal statues of the gods, which were made by Bryaxis.[1326]\r\n\r\nColossal statues used also to be made in Italy. At all events, we see\r\nthe Tuscan Apollo, in the library of the Temple of Augustus,[1327]\r\nfifty feet in height from the toe; and it is a question whether it is\r\nmore remarkable for the quality of the metal, or for the beauty of the\r\nworkmanship. Spurius Carvilius also erected the statue of Jupiter which\r\nis seen in the Capitol, after he had conquered the Samnites,[1328] who\r\nfought in obedience to a most solemn oath; it being formed out of their\r\nbreast-plates, greaves, and helmets, and of such large dimensions that\r\nit may be seen from the statue of Jupiter Latiaris.[1329] He made his\r\nown statue, which is at the feet of the other one, out of the filings\r\nof the metal. There are also, in the Capitol, two heads which are very\r\nmuch admired, and which were dedicated by the Consul P. Lentulus, one\r\nof them executed by the above-mentioned Chares,[1330] the other by\r\nDecius;[1331] but this last is so greatly excelled by the former, as\r\nto have all the appearance of being the work of one of the poorest of\r\nartists.\r\n\r\nBut all these gigantic statues of this kind have been surpassed in our\r\nown age by that of Mercury, made by Zenodotus[1332] for the city of\r\nthe Arverni in Gaul,[1333] which was ten years in being completed, and\r\nthe making of which cost four hundred thousand sesterces. Having given\r\nsufficient proof there of his artistic skill, he was sent for by Nero\r\nto Rome, where he made a colossal statue intended to represent that\r\nprince, one hundred and ten feet in height. In consequence, however, of\r\nthe public detestation of Nero’s crimes, this statue was consecrated to\r\nthe Sun.[1334] We used to admire in his studio, not only the accurate\r\nlikeness in the model of clay, but in the small sketches[1335] also,\r\nwhich served as the first foundation of the work. This statue proves\r\nthat the art of fusing [precious] brass was then lost, for Nero was\r\nprepared to furnish the requisite gold and silver, and Zenodotus\r\nwas inferior to none of the ancients, either as a designer or as an\r\nengraver.[1336] At the time that he was working at the statue for\r\nthe Arverni, he copied for Dubius Avitus, the then governor of the\r\nprovince, two drinking-cups, chased by the hand of Calamis,[1337] which\r\nhad been highly prized by Germanicus Cæsar, and had been given by him\r\nto his preceptor Cassius Silanus, the uncle of Avitus; and this with\r\nsuch exactness, that they could scarcely be distinguished from the\r\noriginals. The greater, then, the superiority of Zenodotus, the more\r\ncertainly it may be concluded that the secret of fusing [precious]\r\nbrass is lost.\r\n\r\n(8.) Persons who possess what are called Corinthian bronzes,[1338]\r\nare generally so much enamoured of them, as to carry them about with\r\nthem from place to place; Hortensius, the orator, for instance, who\r\npossessed a Sphinx, which he had made Verres give him, when accused.\r\nIt was to this figure that Cicero alluded, in an altercation which\r\ntook place at the trial: when, upon Hortensius saying that he could\r\nnot understand enigmas, Cicero made answer that he ought to understand\r\nthem, as he had got a Sphinx[1339] at home. The Emperor Nero, also,\r\nused to carry about with him the figure of an Amazon, of which I shall\r\nspeak further hereafter;[1340] and, shortly before this, C. Cestius, a\r\nperson of consular[1341] rank, had possessed a figure, which he carried\r\nwith him even in battle. The tent, too, of Alexander the Great was\r\nusually supported, it is said, by statues, two of which are consecrated\r\nbefore the Temple of Mars Ultor,[1342] and a similar number before the\r\nPalace.[1343]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—AN ACCOUNT OF THE MOST CELEBRATED WORKS IN BRASS, AND OF THE\r\nARTISTS, 366 IN NUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn almost innumerable multitude of artists have been rendered famous\r\nby their statues and figures of smaller size. Before all others is\r\nPhidias,[1344] the Athenian, who executed the Jupiter at Olympia, in\r\nivory and gold,[1345] but who also made figures in brass as well.\r\nHe flourished in the eighty-third Olympiad, about the year of our\r\nCity, 300. To the same age belong also his rivals Alcamenes,[1346]\r\nCritias,[1347] Nesiotes,[1348] and Hegias.[1349] Afterwards, in the\r\neighty-seventh Olympiad, there were Agelades,[1350] Callon,[1351]\r\nand Gorgias the Laconian. In the ninetieth Olympiad there were\r\nPolycletus,[1352] Phradmon,[1353] Myron,[1354] Pythagoras,[1355]\r\nScopas,[1356] and Perellus.[1357] Of these, Polycletus had for pupils,\r\nArgius,[1358] Asopodorus, Alexis, Aristides,[1359] Phrynon, Dinon,\r\nAthenodorus,[1360] and Demeas[1361] the Clitorian: Lycius,[1362]\r\ntoo, was the pupil of Myron. In the ninety-fifth Olympiad flourished\r\nNaucsydes,[1363] Dinomenes,[1364] Canachus,[1365] and Patroclus.[1366]\r\nIn the hundred and second Olympiad there were Polycles,[1367]\r\nCephisodotus,[1368] Leochares,[1369] and Hypatodorus.[1370] In\r\nthe hundred and fourth Olympiad, flourished Praxiteles[1371] and\r\nEuphranor;[1372] in the hundred and seventh, Aëtion[1373] and\r\nTherimachus;[1374] in the hundred and thirteenth, Lysippus,[1375]\r\nwho was the contemporary of Alexander the Great, his brother\r\nLysistratus,[1376] Sthennis,[1377] Euphron, Eucles, Sostratus,[1378]\r\nIon, and Silanion,[1379] who was remarkable for having acquired\r\ngreat celebrity without any instructor: Zeuxis[1380] was his pupil.\r\nIn the hundred and twenty-first Olympiad were Eutychides,[1381]\r\nEuthycrates,[1382] Laïppus,[1383] Cephisodotus,[1384] Timarchus,[1385]\r\nand Pyromachus.[1386]\r\n\r\nThe practice of this art then ceased for some time, but revived in\r\nthe hundred and fifty-sixth Olympiad, when there were some artists,\r\nwho, though far inferior to those already mentioned, were still highly\r\nesteemed; Antæus, Callistratus,[1387] Polycles,[1388] Athenæus,[1389]\r\nCallixenus, Pythocles, Pythias, and Timocles.[1390]\r\n\r\nThe ages of the most celebrated artists being thus distinguished, I\r\nshall cursorily review the more eminent of them, the greater part being\r\nmentioned in a desultory manner. The most celebrated of these artists,\r\nthough born at different epochs, have joined in a trial of skill in\r\nthe Amazons which they have respectively made. When these statues\r\nwere dedicated in the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, it was agreed, in\r\norder to ascertain which was the best, that it should be left to the\r\njudgment of the artists themselves who were then present: upon which,\r\nit was evident that that was the best, which all the artists agreed\r\nin considering as the next best to his own. Accordingly, the first\r\nrank was assigned to Polycletus, the second to Phidias, the third to\r\nCresilas, the fourth to Cydon, and the fifth to Phradmon.[1391]\r\n\r\nPhidias, besides the Olympian Jupiter, which no one has ever equalled,\r\nalso executed in ivory the erect statue of Minerva, which is in the\r\nParthenon at Athens.[1392] He also made in brass, beside the Amazon\r\nabove mentioned,[1393] a Minerva, of such exquisite beauty, that it\r\nreceived its name from its fine proportions.[1394] He also made the\r\nCliduchus,[1395] and another Minerva, which Paulus Æmilius dedicated at\r\nRome in the Temple of Fortune[1396] of the passing day. Also the two\r\nstatues, draped with the pallium, which Catulus erected in the same\r\ntemple; and a nude colossal statue. Phidias is deservedly considered to\r\nhave discovered and developed the toreutic art.[1397]\r\n\r\nPolycletus of Sicyon,[1398] the pupil of Agelades, executed the\r\nDiadumenos,[1399] the statue of an effeminate youth, and remarkable for\r\nhaving cost one hundred talents; as also the statue of a youth full of\r\nmanly vigour, and called the Doryphoros.[1400] He also made what the\r\nartists have called the Model statue,[1401] and from which, as from a\r\nsort of standard, they study the lineaments: so that he, of all men,\r\nis thought in one work of art to have exhausted all the resources of\r\nart. He also made statues of a man using the body-scraper,[1402] and\r\nof a naked man challenging to play at dice;[1403] as also of two naked\r\nboys playing at dice, and known as the Astragalizontes;[1404] they are\r\nnow in the atrium of the Emperor Titus, and it is generally considered,\r\nthat there can be no work more perfect than this. He also executed a\r\nMercury, which was formerly at Lysimachia; a Hercules Ageter,[1405]\r\nseizing his arms, which is now at Rome; and an Artemon, which has\r\nreceived the name of Periphoretos.[1406] Polycletus is generally\r\nconsidered as having attained the highest excellence in statuary, and\r\nas having perfected the toreutic[1407] art, which Phidias invented. A\r\ndiscovery which was entirely his own, was the art of placing statues on\r\none leg. It is remarked, however, by Varro, that his statues are all\r\nsquare-built,[1408] and made very much after the same model.[1409]\r\n\r\nMyron of Eleutheræ,[1410] who was also the pupil of Agelades, was\r\nrendered more particularly famous by his statue of a heifer,[1411]\r\ncelebrated in many well-known lines: so true is it, that most men\r\nowe their renown more to the genius of others, than to their own.\r\nHe also made the figure of a dog,[1412] a Discobolus,[1413] a\r\nPerseus,[1414] the Pristæ,[1415] a Satyr[1416] admiring a flute, and\r\na Minerva, the Delphic Pentathletes,[1417] the Pancratiastæ,[1418]\r\nand a Hercules,[1419] which is at the Circus Maximus, in the house\r\nof Pompeius Magnus. Erinna,[1420] in her poems,[1421] makes allusion\r\nto a monument which he erected to a cricket and a locust. He also\r\nexecuted the Apollo, which, after being taken from the Ephesians by\r\nthe Triumvir Antonius, was restored by the Emperor Augustus, he having\r\nbeen admonished to do so in a dream. Myron appears to have been the\r\nfirst to give a varied development to the art,[1422] having made a\r\ngreater number of designs than Polycletus, and shewn more attention to\r\nsymmetry. And yet, though he was very accurate in the proportions of\r\nhis figures, he has neglected to give expression; besides which, he has\r\nnot treated the hair and the pubes with any greater attention than is\r\nobserved in the rude figures of more ancient times.\r\n\r\nPythagoras of Rhegium, in Italy, excelled him in the figure of the\r\nPancratiast[1423] which is now at Delphi, and in which he also\r\nsurpassed Leontiscus.[1424] Pythagoras also executed the statue of\r\nAstylos,[1425] the runner, which is exhibited at Olympia; that of a\r\nLibyan boy holding a tablet, also in the same place; and a nude male\r\nfigure holding fruit. There is at Syracuse a figure of a lame man by\r\nhim: persons, when looking at it, seem to feel the very pain of his\r\nwound. He also made an Apollo, with the serpent[1426] pierced by his\r\narrows; and a Player on the Lyre, known as the Dicæus,[1427] from the\r\nfact that, when Thebes was taken by Alexander the Great, a fugitive\r\nsuccessfully concealed in its bosom a sum of gold. He was the first\r\nartist who gave expression to the sinews and the veins, and paid more\r\nattention to the hair.\r\n\r\nThere was also another Pythagoras, a Samian,[1428] who was originally\r\na painter, seven of whose nude figures, in the Temple of Fortune of\r\nthe passing day,[1429] and one of an aged man, are very much admired.\r\nHe is said to have resembled the last-mentioned artist so much in his\r\nfeatures, that they could not be distinguished. Sostratus, it is said,\r\nwas the pupil of Pythagoras of Rhegium, and his sister’s son.\r\n\r\nAccording to Duris,[1430] Lysippus the Sicyonian was not the\r\npupil[1431] of any one, but was originally a worker in brass, and was\r\nfirst prompted to venture upon statuary by an answer that was given by\r\nEupompus the painter; who, upon being asked which of his predecessors\r\nhe proposed to take for his model, pointed to a crowd of men, and\r\nreplied that it was Nature herself, and no artist, that he proposed\r\nto imitate. As already mentioned,[1432] Lysippus was most prolific\r\nin his works, and made more statues than any other artist. Among\r\nthese, is the Man using the Body-scraper[1433], which Marcus Agrippa\r\nhad erected in front of his Warm Baths,[1434] and which wonderfully\r\npleased the Emperor Tiberius. This prince, although in the beginning\r\nof his reign he imposed some restraint upon himself, could not resist\r\nthe temptation, and had this statue removed to his bed-chamber, having\r\nsubstituted another for it at the baths: the people, however, were\r\nso resolutely opposed to this, that at the theatre they clamourously\r\ndemanded the Apoxyomenos[1435] to be replaced; and the prince,\r\nnotwithstanding his attachment to it, was obliged to restore it.\r\n\r\nLysippus is also celebrated for his statue of the intoxicated Female\r\nFlute-player, his dogs and huntsmen, and, more particularly, for\r\nhis Chariot with the Sun, as represented by the Rhodians.[1436] He\r\nalso executed a numerous series of statues of Alexander the Great,\r\ncommencing from his childhood.[1437] The Emperor Nero was so delighted\r\nwith his statue of the infant Alexander, that he had it gilt: this\r\naddition, however, to its value, so detracted from its artistic beauty\r\nthat the gold was removed, and in this state it was looked upon as\r\nstill more precious, though disfigured by the scratches and seams which\r\nremained upon it, and in which the gold was still to be seen.[1438]\r\nHe also made the statue of Hephæstion, the friend of Alexander the\r\nGreat, which some persons attribute to Polycletus, whereas that artist\r\nlived nearly a century before his time.[1439] Also, the statue of\r\nAlexander at the chase, now consecrated at Delphi, the figure of a\r\nSatyr, now at Athens, and the Squadron of Alexander,[1440] all of\r\nwhom he represented with the greatest accuracy. This last work of art,\r\nafter his conquest of Macedonia,[1441] Metellus conveyed to Rome.\r\nLysippus also executed chariots of various kinds. He is considered to\r\nhave contributed very greatly to the art of statuary by expressing the\r\ndetails of the hair,[1442] and by making the head smaller than had\r\nbeen done by the ancients, and the body more graceful and less bulky,\r\na method by which his statues were made to appear taller. The Latin\r\nlanguage has no appropriate name for that “symmetry,”[1443] which he\r\nso attentively observed in his new and hitherto untried method of\r\nmodifying the squareness observable in the ancient statues. Indeed,\r\nit was a common saying of his, that other artists made men as they\r\nactually were, while he made them as they appeared to be. One peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of his work, is the finish and minuteness which are\r\nobserved in even the smallest details. Lysippus left three sons, who\r\nwere also his pupils, and became celebrated as artists, Laippus, Bœdas,\r\nand, more particularly, Euthycrates; though this last-named artist\r\nrivalled his father in precision rather than in elegance, and preferred\r\nscrupulous correctness to gracefulness. Nothing can be more expressive\r\nthan his Hercules at Delphi, his Alexander, his Hunter at Thespiæ, and\r\nhis Equestrian Combat. Equally good, too, are his statue of Trophonius,\r\nerected in the oracular cave[1444] of that divinity, his numerous\r\nchariots, his Horse with the Panniers,[1445] and his hounds.\r\n\r\nTisicrates, also a native of Sicyon, was a pupil of Euthycrates, but\r\nmore nearly approaching the style of Lysippus; so much so, that several\r\nof his statues can scarcely be distinguished from those of Lysippus;\r\nhis aged Theban, for example, his King Demetrius, and his Peucestes,\r\nwho saved the life of Alexander the Great, and so rendered himself\r\ndeserving of this honour.[1446]\r\n\r\nArtists, who have transmitted these details in their works, bestow\r\nwonderful encomiums upon Telephanes, the Phocæan, a statuary but little\r\nknown, they say, because he lived in Thessaly, where his works remained\r\nconcealed; according to their account, however, he is quite equal to\r\nPolycletus, Myron, and Pythagoras. They more particularly commend his\r\nLarissa, his Spintharus, the pentathlete,[1447] and his Apollo. Others,\r\nhowever, assign another reason for his being so little known; it\r\nbeing owing, they think, to his having devoted himself to the studios\r\nestablished by Kings Xerxes and Darius.\r\n\r\nPraxiteles, who excelled more particularly in marble, and thence\r\nacquired his chief celebrity, also executed some very beautiful\r\nworks in brass, the Rape of Proserpine, the Catagusa,[1448] a Father\r\nLiber,[1449] a figure of Drunkenness, and the celebrated Satyr,[1450]\r\nto the Greeks known as “Periboetos.”[1451] He also executed the\r\nstatues, which were formerly before the Temple[1452] of Good Fortune,\r\nand the Venus, which was destroyed by fire, with the Temple of\r\nthat goddess, in the reign of Claudius, and was considered equal\r\nto his marble statue of Venus,[1453] so celebrated throughout the\r\nworld. He also executed a Stephanusa,[1454] a Spilumene,[1455] an\r\nŒnophorus,[1456] and two figures of Harmodius and Aristogiton, who slew\r\nthe tyrants; which last, having been taken away from Greece by Xerxes,\r\nwere restored to the Athenians on the conquest of Persia by Alexander\r\nthe Great.[1457] He also made the youthful Apollo, known as the\r\n“Sauroctonos,”[1458] because he is aiming an arrow at a lizard which is\r\nstealing towards him. There are greatly admired, also, two statues of\r\nhis, expressive of contrary emotions—a Matron in tears, and a Courtesan\r\nfull of gaiety: this last is supposed to be a likeness of Phryne, and\r\nit is said that we can detect in her figure the love of the artist, and\r\nin the countenance of the courtesan the promised reward.[1459]\r\n\r\nHis kindness of heart, too, is witnessed by another figure; for in a\r\nchariot and horses which had been executed by Calamis,[1460] he himself\r\nmade the charioteer, in order that the artist, who excelled in the\r\nrepresentation of horses, might not be considered deficient in the\r\nhuman figure. This last-mentioned artist has executed other chariots\r\nalso, some with four horses, and some with two; and in his horses he\r\nis always unrivalled. But that it may not be supposed that he was so\r\ngreatly inferior in his human figures, it is as well to remark that his\r\nAlcmena[1461] is equal to any that was ever produced.\r\n\r\nAlcamenes,[1462] who was a pupil of Phidias, worked in marble and\r\nexecuted a Pentathlete in brass, known as the “Encrinomenos.”[1463]\r\nAristides, too, who was the scholar of Polycletus, executed chariots in\r\nmetal with four and two horses. The Leæna[1464] of Amphicrates[1465]\r\nis highly commended. The courtesan[1466] Leæna, who was a skilful\r\nperformer on the lyre, and had so become acquainted with Harmodius\r\nand Aristogiton, submitted to be tortured till she expired, rather\r\nthan betray their plot for the extermination of the tyrants.[1467]\r\nThe Athenians, being desirous of honouring her memory, without at the\r\nsame time rendering homage to a courtesan, had her represented under\r\nthe figure of the animal whose name she bore;[1468] and, in order to\r\nindicate the cause of the honour thus paid her, ordered the artist to\r\nrepresent the animal without a tongue.[1469]\r\n\r\nBryaxis executed in brass statues of Æsculapius and Seleucus;[1470]\r\nBœdas[1471] a figure in adoration; Baton, an Apollo and a Juno, which\r\nare in the Temple of Concord[1472] at Rome.\r\n\r\nCtesilaüs[1473] executed a statue of a man fainting from his wounds, in\r\nthe expression of which may be seen how little life remains;[1474] as\r\nalso the Olympian Pericles,[1475] well worthy of its title: indeed, it\r\nis one of the marvellous adjuncts of this art, that it renders men who\r\nare already celebrated even more so.\r\n\r\nCephisodotus[1476] is the artist of an admirable Minerva, now erected\r\nin the port of Athens; as also of the altar before the Temple of\r\nJupiter Servator,[1477] at the same place, to which, indeed, few works\r\nare comparable.\r\n\r\nCanachus[1478] executed a nude Apollo, which is known as the\r\n“Philesian:”[1479] it is at Didymi,[1480] and is composed of bronze\r\nthat was fused at Ægina. He also made a stag with it, so nicely poised\r\non its hoofs, as to admit of a thread being passed beneath. One[1481]\r\nfore-foot, too, and the alternate hind-foot are so made as firmly to\r\ngrip the base, the socket being[1482] so indented on either side, as\r\nto admit of the figure being thrown at pleasure upon alternate feet.\r\nAnother work of his was the boys known as the “Celetizontes.”[1483]\r\n\r\nChæreas made statues of Alexander the Great and of his father Philip.\r\nDesilaüs[1484] made a Doryphoros[1485] and a wounded Amazon; and\r\nDemetrius[1486] a statue of Lysimache, who was priestess of Minerva\r\nsixty-four years. This statuary also made the Minerva, which has the\r\nname of Musica,[1487] and so called because the dragons on its Gorgon’s\r\nhead vibrate at the sound of the lyre; also an equestrian statue of\r\nSimon, the first writer on the art of equitation.[1488] Dædalus,[1489]\r\nwho is highly esteemed as a modeller in clay, made two brazen figures\r\nof youths using the body-scraper;[1490] and Dinomenes executed figures\r\nof Protesilaüs[1491] and Pythodemus the wrestler.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Alexander Paris is the work of Euphranor:[1492] it is\r\nmuch admired, because we recognize in it, at the same moment, all these\r\ncharacteristics; we see him as the umpire between the goddesses, the\r\nparamour of Helen, and yet the slayer of Achilles. We have a Minerva,\r\ntoo, by Euphranor, at Rome, known as the “Catulina,” and dedicated\r\nbelow the Capitol, by Q. Lutatius;[1493] also a figure of Good\r\nSuccess,[1494] holding in the right hand a patera, and in the left an\r\near of corn and a poppy. There is also a Latona by him, in the Temple\r\nof Concord,[1495] with the new-born infants Apollo and Diana in her\r\narms. He also executed some brazen chariots with four and two horses,\r\nand a Cliduchus[1496] of beautiful proportions; as also two colossal\r\nstatues, one representing Virtue, the other Greece;[1497] and a figure\r\nof a female lost in wonder and adoration: with statues of Alexander and\r\nPhilip in chariots with four horses. Eutychides executed an emblematic\r\nfigure of the Eurotas,[1498] of which it has been frequently remarked,\r\nthat the work of the artist appears more flowing than the waters even\r\nof the river.[1499]\r\n\r\nHegias[1500] is celebrated for his Minerva and his King Pyrrhus, his\r\nyouthful Celetizontes,[1501] and his statues of Castor and Pollux,\r\nbefore the Temple of Jupiter Tonans:[1502] Hegesias,[1503] for his\r\nHercules, which is at our colony of Parium.[1504] Of Isidotus we have\r\nthe Buthytes.[1505]\r\n\r\nLycius was the pupil[1506] of Myron: he made a figure representing a\r\nboy blowing a nearly extinguished fire, well worthy of his master, as\r\nalso figures of the Argonauts. Leochares made a bronze representing the\r\neagle carrying off Ganymede: the eagle has all the appearance of being\r\nsensible of the importance of his burden, and for whom he is carrying\r\nit, being careful not to injure the youth with his talons, even through\r\nthe garments.[1507] He executed a figure, also, of Autolycus,[1508] who\r\nhad been victorious in the contests of the Pancratium, and for whom\r\nXenophon wrote his Symposium;[1509] the figure, also, of Jupiter Tonans\r\nin the Capitol, the most admired of all his works; and a statue of\r\nApollo crowned with a diadem. He executed, also, a figure of Lyciscus,\r\nand one of the boy Lagon,[1510] full of the archness and low-bred\r\ncunning of the slave. Lycius also made a figure of a boy burning\r\nperfumes.\r\n\r\nWe have a young bull by Menæchmus,[1511] pressed down beneath a man’s\r\nknee, with its neck bent back:[1512] this Menæchmus has also written\r\na treatise on his art. Naucydes[1513] is admired for a Mercury,\r\na Discobolus,[1514] and a Man sacrificing a Ram. Naucerus made a\r\nfigure of a wrestler panting for breath; Niceratus, an Æsculapius and\r\nHygeia,[1515] which are in the Temple of Concord at Rome. Pyromachus\r\nrepresented Alcibiades, managing a chariot with four horses:\r\nPolycles made a splendid statue of Hermaphroditus; Pyrrhus, statues\r\nof Hygeia and Minerva; and Phanis, who was a pupil of Lysippus, an\r\nEpithyusa.[1516]\r\n\r\nStypax of Cyprus acquired his celebrity by a single work, the statue\r\nof the Splanchnoptes;[1517] which represents a slave of the Olympian\r\nPericles, roasting entrails and kindling the fire with his breath.\r\nSilanion made a statue in metal of Apollodorus, who was himself a\r\nmodeller, and not only the most diligent of all in the study of this\r\nart, but a most severe criticizer of his own works, frequently breaking\r\nhis statues to pieces when he had finished them, and never able to\r\nsatisfy his intense passion for the art—a circumstance which procured\r\nhim the surname of “the Madman.” Indeed, it is this expression which\r\nhe has given to his works, which represent in metal embodied anger\r\nrather than the lineaments of a human being. The Achilles, also, of\r\nSilanion is very excellent, and his Epistates[1518] exercising the\r\nAthletes. Strongylion[1519] made a figure of an Amazon, which, from the\r\nbeauty of the legs, was known as the “Eucnemos,”[1520] and which Nero\r\nused to have carried about with him in his travels. Strongylion was\r\nthe artist, also, of a youthful figure, which was so much admired by\r\nBrutus of Philippi, that it received from him its surname.[1521]\r\n\r\nTheodorus of Samos,[1522] who constructed the Labyrinth,[1523] cast\r\nhis own statue in brass; which was greatly admired, not only for its\r\nresemblance, but for the extreme delicacy of the work. In the right\r\nhand he holds a file, and with three fingers of the left, a little\r\nmodel of a four-horse chariot, which has since been transferred to\r\nPræneste:[1524] it is so extremely minute, that the whole piece, both\r\nchariot and charioteer, may be covered by the wings of a fly, which he\r\nalso made with it.\r\n\r\nXenocrates[1525] was the pupil of Ticrates, or, as some say, of\r\nEuthycrates: he surpassed them both, however, in the number of his\r\nstatues, and was the author of some treatises on his art.\r\n\r\nSeveral artists have represented the battles fought by Attalus and\r\nEumenes with the Galli;[1526] Isigonus, for instance, Pyromachus,\r\nStratonicus, and Antigonus,[1527] who also wrote some works in\r\nreference to his art. Boëthus,[1528] although more celebrated for his\r\nworks in silver, has executed a beautiful figure of a child strangling\r\na goose. The most celebrated of all the works, of which I have here\r\nspoken, have been dedicated, for some time past, by the Emperor\r\nVespasianus in the Temple of Peace,[1529] and other public buildings\r\nof his. They had before been forcibly carried off by Nero,[1530] and\r\nbrought to Rome, and arranged by him in the reception-rooms of his\r\nGolden Palace.[1531]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there are several other artists, of about equal\r\ncelebrity, but none of whom have produced any first-rate works;\r\nAriston,[1532] who was principally employed in chasing silver,\r\nCallides, Ctesias, Cantharus of Sicyon,[1533] Diodorus, a pupil of\r\nCritias, Deliades, Euphorion, Eunicus,[1534] and Hecatæus,[1535] all\r\nof them chasers in silver; Lesbocles, also, Prodorus, Pythodicus, and\r\nPolygnotus,[1536] one of the most celebrated painters; also two other\r\nchasers in silver, Stratonicus,[1537] and Scymnus, a pupil of Critias.\r\n\r\nI shall now enumerate those artists who have executed works of the same\r\nclass:— Apollodorus,[1538] for example, Antrobulus, Asclepiodorus, and\r\nAleuas, who have executed statues of philosophers. Apellas[1539] has\r\nleft us some figures of females in the act of adoration; Antignotus, a\r\nPerixyomenos,[1540] and figures of the Tyrannicides, already mentioned.\r\nAntimachus and Athenodorus made some statues of females of noble birth;\r\nAristodemus[1541] executed figures of wrestlers, two-horse chariots\r\nwith the charioteers, philosophers, aged women, and a statue of King\r\nSeleucus:[1542] his Doryphoros,[1543] too, possesses his characteristic\r\ngracefulness.\r\n\r\nThere were two artists of the name of Cephisodotus:[1544] the earlier\r\nof them made a figure of Mercury nursing Father Liber[1545] when an\r\ninfant; also of a man haranguing, with the hand elevated, the original\r\nof which is now unknown. The younger Cephisodotus executed statues\r\nof philosophers. Colotes,[1546] who assisted Phidias in the Olympian\r\nJupiter, also executed statues of philosophers; the same, too, with\r\nCleon,[1547] Cenchramis, Callicles,[1548] and Cepis. Chalcosthenes\r\nmade statues of comedians and athletes. Daïppus[1549] executed a\r\nPerixyomenos.[1550] Daïphron, Democritus,[1551] and Dæmon made statues\r\nof philosophers.\r\n\r\nEpigonus, who has attempted nearly all the above-named classes of\r\nworks, has distinguished himself more particularly by his Trumpeter,\r\nand his Child in Tears, caressing its murdered mother. The Woman in\r\nAdmiration, of Eubulus, is highly praised; and so is the Man, by\r\nEubulides,[1552] reckoning on his Fingers. Micon[1553] is admired for\r\nhis athletes; Menogenes, for his four-horse chariots. Niceratus,[1554]\r\ntoo, who attempted every kind of work that had been executed by\r\nany other artist, made statues of Alcibiades and of his mother\r\nDemarate,[1555] who is represented sacrificing by the light of torches.\r\n\r\nTisicrates[1556] executed a two-horse chariot in brass, in which Piston\r\nafterwards placed the figure of a female. Piston also made the statues\r\nof Mars and Mercury, which are in the Temple of Concord at Rome.\r\nNo one can commend Perillus;[1557] more cruel even than the tyrant\r\nPhalaris[1558] himself, he made for him a brazen bull, asserting that\r\nwhen a man was enclosed in it, and fire applied beneath, the cries of\r\nthe man would resemble the roaring of a bull: however, with a cruelty\r\nin this instance marked by justice, the experiment of this torture was\r\nfirst tried upon himself. To such a degree did this man degrade the art\r\nof representing gods and men, an art more adapted than any other to\r\nrefine the feelings! Surely so many persons had not toiled to perfect\r\nit in order to make it an instrument of torture! Hence it is that the\r\nworks of Perillus are only preserved, in order that whoever sees them,\r\nmay detest the hands that made them.\r\n\r\nSthennis[1559] made the statues of Ceres, Jupiter, and Minerva, which\r\nare now in the Temple of Concord; also figures of matrons weeping,\r\nadoring, and offering sacrifice; Simon[1560] executed figures of a\r\ndog and an archer. Stratonicus,[1561] the chaser in silver, made\r\nsome figures of philosophers; and so did both of the artists named\r\nScopas.[1562]\r\n\r\nThe following artists have made statues of athletes, armed\r\nmen, hunters, and sacrifices—Baton,[1563] Euchir,[1564]\r\nGlaucides,[1565] Heliodorus,[1566] Hicanus, Leophon, Lyson,[1567]\r\nLeon, Menodorus,[1568] Myagrus,[1569] Polycrates, Polyidus,[1570]\r\nPythocritus, Protogenes, a famous painter, whom we shall\r\nhave occasion to mention hereafter;[1571] Patrocles, Pollis,\r\nPosidonius[1572] the Ephesian, who was also a celebrated chaser in\r\nsilver; Periclymenus,[1573] Philon,[1574] Symenus, Timotheus,[1575]\r\nTheomnestus,[1576] Timarchides,[1577] Timon, Tisias, and Thrason.[1578]\r\n\r\nBut of all these, Callimachus is the most remarkable, on account of\r\nhis surname. Being always dissatisfied with himself, and continually\r\ncorrecting his works, he obtained the name of “Catatexitechnos;”[1579]\r\nthus affording a memorable example of the necessity of observing\r\nmoderation even in carefulness. His Laconian Female Dancers, for\r\ninstance, is a most correct performance, but one in which, by extreme\r\ncorrectness, he has effaced all gracefulness. It has been said, too,\r\nthat Callimachus was a painter also. Cato, in his expedition against\r\nCyprus,[1580] sold all the statues that he found there, with the\r\nexception of one of Zeno; in which case he was influenced, neither by\r\nthe value of the metal nor by its excellence as a work of art, but by\r\nthe fact that it was the statue of a philosopher. I only mention this\r\ncircumstance casually, that an example[1581] so little followed, may be\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of statues, there is one other that should not be\r\nomitted, although its author is unknown, that of Hercules clothed in\r\na tunic,[1582] the only one represented in that costume in Rome: it\r\nstands near the Rostra, and the countenance is stern and expressive of\r\nhis last agonies, caused by that dress. There are three inscriptions\r\non it; the first of which states that it had formed part of the spoil\r\nobtained by L. Lucullus[1583] the general; the second, that his son,\r\nwhile still a minor, dedicated in accordance with a decree of the\r\nSenate; the third, that T. Septimius Sabinus, the curule ædile, had it\r\nrestored to the public from the hands of a private individual. So vast\r\nhas been the rivalry caused by this statue, and so high the value set\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COPPER AND ITS COMBINATIONS. PYROPUS.\r\nCAMPANIAN COPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the different kinds of copper, and its\r\nseveral combinations. In Cyprian copper we have the kind known as\r\n“coronarium,”[1584] and that called “regulare,”[1585] both of them\r\nductile. The former is made into thin leaves, and, after being coloured\r\nwith ox-gall,[1586] is used for what has all the appearance of gilding\r\non the coronets worn upon the stage. The same substance, if mixed\r\nwith gold, in the proportion of six scruples of gold to the ounce,\r\nand reduced into thin plates, acquires a fiery red colour, and is\r\ntermed “pyropus.”[1587] In other mines again, they prepare the kind\r\nknown as “regulare,” as also that which is called “caldarium.”[1588]\r\nThese differ from each other in this respect, that, in the latter, the\r\nmetal is only fused, and breaks when struck with the hammer, whereas\r\nthe “regulare” is malleable, or ductile,[1589] as some call it, a\r\nproperty which belongs naturally to all the copper of Cyprus. In the\r\ncase, however, of all the other mines, this difference between bar\r\ncopper and cast brass is produced by artificial means. All the ores,\r\nin fact, will produce bar or malleable copper when sufficiently melted\r\nand purified by heat. Among the other kinds of copper, the palm of\r\nexcellence is awarded to that of Campania,[1590] which is the most\r\nesteemed for vessels and utensils. This last is prepared several ways.\r\nAt Capua it is melted upon fires made with wood, and not coals, after\r\nwhich it is sprinkled with cold water and cleansed through a sieve made\r\nof oak. After being thus smelted a number of times, Spanish silver-lead\r\nis added to it, in the proportion of ten pounds of lead to one hundred\r\npounds of copper; a method by which it is rendered pliable, and made\r\nto assume that agreeable colour which is imparted to other kinds of\r\ncopper by the application of oil and the action of the sun. Many parts,\r\nhowever, of Italy, and the provinces, produce a similar kind of metal;\r\nbut there they add only eight pounds of lead, and, in consequence of\r\nthe scarcity of wood, melt it several times over upon coals. It is in\r\nGaul more particularly, where the ore is melted between red-hot stones,\r\nthat the difference is to be seen that is produced by these variations\r\nin the method of smelting. Indeed, this last method scorches the metal,\r\nand renders it black and friable. Besides, they only melt it twice;\r\nwhereas, the oftener this operation is repeated, the better in quality\r\nit becomes.\r\n\r\n(9.) It is also as well to remark that all copper fuses best when the\r\nweather is intensely cold. The proper combination for making statues\r\nand tablets is as follows: the ore is first melted; after which there\r\nis added to the molten metal one third part of second-hand[1591]\r\ncopper, or in other words, copper that has been in use and bought up\r\nfor the purpose. For it is a peculiarity of this metal that when it has\r\nbeen some time in use, and has been subject to long-continued friction,\r\nit becomes seasoned, and subdued, as it were, to a high polish. Twelve\r\npounds and a half of silver-lead are then added to every hundred pounds\r\nof the fused metal. There is also a combination of copper, of a most\r\ndelicate nature, “mould-copper,”[1592] as it is called; there being\r\nadded to the metal one tenth part of lead[1593] and one twentieth\r\nof silver-lead, this combination being the best adapted for taking\r\nthe colour known as “Græcænicus.”[1594] The last kind is that known\r\nas “ollaria,”[1595] from the vessels that are made of it: in this\r\ncombination three or four pounds of silver-lead[1596] are added to\r\nevery hundred pounds of copper. By the addition of lead to Cyprian\r\ncopper, the purple tint is produced that we see upon the drapery of\r\nstatues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—THE METHOD OF PRESERVING COPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopper becomes covered with verdigris more quickly when cleaned than\r\nwhen neglected, unless it is well rubbed with oil. It is said that\r\nthe best method of preserving it is with a coating of tar. The custom\r\nof making use of copper for monuments, which are intended to be\r\nperpetuated, is of very ancient date: it is upon tablets of brass that\r\nour public enactments are engraved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (10.)—CADMIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ores of copper furnish a number of resources[1597] that are\r\nemployed in medicine; indeed, all kinds of ulcers are healed\r\nthereby with great rapidity. Of these, however, the most useful is\r\ncadmia.[1598] This substance is formed artificially, beyond a doubt,\r\nin the furnaces, also, where they smelt silver, but it is whiter and\r\nnot so heavy, and by no means to be compared with that from copper.\r\nThere are several kinds of it. For, as the mineral itself, from which\r\nit is prepared artificially, so necessary in fusing copper ore, and so\r\nuseful in medicine, has the name of “cadmia,”[1599] so also is it found\r\nin the smelting-furnaces, where it receives other names, according\r\nto the way in which it is formed. By the action of the flame and the\r\nblast, the more attenuated parts of the metal are separated, and become\r\nattached, in proportion to their lightness, to the arched top and\r\nsides of the furnace. These flakes are the thinnest near the exterior\r\nopening of the furnace, where the flame finds a vent, the substance\r\nbeing called “capnitis;”[1600] from its burnt appearance and its\r\nextreme lightness it resembles white ashes. The best is that which is\r\nfound in the interior, hanging from the arches of the chimney, and from\r\nits form and position named “botryitis.”[1601] It is heavier than the\r\nfirst-mentioned kind, but lighter than those which follow. It is of two\r\ndifferent colours: the least valuable is ash-coloured, the better kind\r\nbeing red, friable, and extremely useful as a remedy for affections of\r\nthe eyes.\r\n\r\nA third kind of cadmia is that found on the sides of the furnace,\r\nand which, in consequence of its weight, could not reach the arched\r\nvaults of the chimney. This species is called “placitis,”[1602] in\r\nreference to its solid appearance, it presenting a plane surface more\r\nlike a solid crust than pumice, and mottled within. Its great use\r\nis, for the cure of itch-scab, and for making wounds cicatrize. Of\r\nthis last there are two varieties, the “onychitis,” which is almost\r\nentirely blue on the exterior, and spotted like an onyx within; and\r\nthe “ostracitis,”[1603] which is quite black and more dirty than the\r\nothers, but particularly useful for healing wounds. All the species of\r\ncadmia are of the best quality from the furnaces of Cyprus. When used\r\nin medicine it is heated a second time upon a fire of pure charcoal,\r\nand when duly incinerated, is quenched in Aminean[1604] wine, if\r\nrequired for making plasters, but in vinegar, if wanted for the cure\r\nof itch-scab. Some persons first pound it, and then burn it in earthen\r\npots; which done, they wash it in mortars and then dry it.\r\n\r\nNymphodorus[1605] recommends that the most heavy and dense pieces of\r\nmineral cadmia that can be procured, should be burnt upon hot coals and\r\nquenched in Chian wine; after which, it must be pounded and then sifted\r\nthrough a linen cloth. It is then pulverized in a mortar and macerated\r\nin rain water, the sediment being again pounded until it is reduced to\r\nthe consistency of ceruse, and presents no grittiness to the teeth.\r\nIollas[1606] recommends the same process; except that he selects the\r\npurest specimens of native cadmia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM CADMIA. TEN MEDICINAL EFFECTS\r\nOF CALCINED COPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCadmia[1607] acts as a desiccative, heals wounds, arrests discharges,\r\nacts detergently upon webs and foul incrustations of the eyes, removes\r\neruptions, and produces, in fact, all the good effects which we shall\r\nhave occasion to mention when speaking of lead. Copper too, itself,\r\nwhen calcined, is employed for all these purposes; in addition to which\r\nit is used for white spots and cicatrizations upon the eyes. Mixed with\r\nmilk, it is curative also of ulcers upon the eyes; for which purpose,\r\nthe people in Egypt make a kind of eye-salve by grinding it upon whet\r\nstones. Taken with honey, it acts as an emetic. For these purposes,\r\nCyprian copper is calcined in unbaked earthen pots, with an equal\r\nquantity of sulphur; the apertures of the vessel being well luted,\r\nand it being left in the furnace until the vessel itself has become\r\ncompletely hardened. Some persons add salt, and others substitute\r\nalum[1608] for sulphur; others, again, add nothing, but merely sprinkle\r\nthe copper with vinegar. When calcined, it is pounded in a mortar of\r\nThebaic stone,[1609] after which it is washed with rain water, and\r\nthen pounded with a large quantity of water, and left to settle.\r\nThis process is repeated until the deposit has gained the appearance\r\nof minium;[1610] after which it is dried in the sun, and put by for\r\nkeeping in a box made of copper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24. (11.)—THE SCORIA OF COPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scoria, too, of copper is washed in the same manner; but the action\r\nof it is less efficacious than that of copper itself. The flower,\r\ntoo, of copper[1611] is also used in medicine; a substance which is\r\nprocured by fusing copper, and then removing it into another furnace,\r\nwhere the repeated action of the bellows makes the metal separate\r\ninto small scales, like the husks of millet, and known as “flower of\r\ncopper.” These scales are also separated, when the cakes of metal are\r\nplunged into water: they become red, too, like the scales of copper\r\nknown as “lepis,”[1612] by means of which the genuine flower of copper\r\nis adulterated, it being also sold under that name. This last is made\r\nby hammering nails that are forged from the cakes of metal. All these\r\nprocesses are principally carried on in the furnaces of Cyprus; the\r\ngreat difference between these substances being, that this lepis is\r\ndetached from the cakes by hammering, whereas the flower falls off\r\nspontaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—STOMOMA OF COPPER; FORTY-SEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another finer kind of scale which is detached from the surface\r\nof the metal, like a very fine down, and known as “stomoma.”[1613] But\r\nof all these substances, and even of their names, the physicians, if\r\nI may venture so to say, are quite ignorant, as appears by the names\r\nthey give them; so unacquainted are they with the preparation of\r\nmedicaments, a thing that was formerly considered the most essential\r\npart of their profession.[1614] At the present day, whenever they\r\nhappen to find a book of recipes, if they wish to make any composition\r\nfrom these substances, or, in other words, to make trial of the\r\nprescription at the expense of their unhappy patients, they trust\r\nentirely to the druggists,[1615] who spoil everything by their\r\nfraudulent adulterations. For this long time past, they have even\r\npurchased their plasters and eye-salves ready made, and the consequence\r\nis, that the spoiled or adulterated wares in the druggists’ shops are\r\nthus got rid of.\r\n\r\nBoth lepis and flower of copper are calcined in shallow earthen or\r\nbrazen pans; after which they are washed, as described above,[1616] and\r\nemployed for the same purposes; in addition to which, they are used\r\nfor excrescences in the nostrils and in the anus, as also for dullness\r\nof the hearing, being forcibly blown into the ears through a tube.\r\nIncorporated with meal, they are applied to swellings of the uvula,\r\nand, with honey, to swellings of the tonsils. The scales prepared from\r\nwhite copper are much less efficacious than those from Cyprian copper.\r\nSometimes they first macerate the nails and cakes of copper in a boy’s\r\nurine; and in some instances, they pound the scales, when detached, and\r\nwash them in rain water. They are then given to dropsical patients, in\r\ndoses of two drachmæ, with one semisextarius of honied wine: they are\r\nalso made into a liniment with fine flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—VERDIGRIS; EIGHTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdigris[1617] is also applied to many purposes, and is prepared\r\nin numerous ways. Sometimes it is detached already formed, from the\r\nmineral from which copper is smelted: and sometimes it is made by\r\npiercing holes in white copper, and suspending it over strong vinegar\r\nin casks, which are closed with covers; it being much superior if\r\nscales of copper are used for the purpose. Some persons plunge\r\nvessels themselves, made of white copper, into earthen pots filled\r\nwith vinegar, and scrape them at the end of ten days. Others, again,\r\ncover the vessels with husks of grapes,[1618] and scrape them in\r\nthe same way, at the end of ten days. Others sprinkle vinegar upon\r\ncopper filings, and stir them frequently with a spatula in the course\r\nof the day, until they are completely dissolved. Others prefer\r\ntriturating these filings with vinegar in a brazen mortar: but the most\r\nexpeditious method of all is to add to the vinegar shavings of coronet\r\ncopper.[1619] Rhodian verdigris, more particularly, is adulterated with\r\npounded marble; some persons use pumice-stone or gum.\r\n\r\nThe adulteration, however, which is the most difficult to detect, is\r\nmade with copperas;[1620] the other sophistications being detected by\r\nthe crackling of the substance when bitten with the teeth. The best\r\nmode of testing it is by using an iron fire-shovel; for when thus\r\nsubjected to the fire, if pure, the verdigris retains its colour, but\r\nif mixed with copperas, it becomes red. The fraud may also be detected\r\nby using a leaf of papyrus, which has been steeped in an infusion of\r\nnut-galls; for it becomes black immediately upon the genuine verdigris\r\nbeing applied. It may also be detected by the eye; the green colour\r\nbeing unpleasant to the sight. But whether it is pure or adulterated,\r\nthe best method is first to wash and dry it, and then to burn it\r\nin a new earthen vessel, turning it over until it is reduced to an\r\nash;[1621] after which it is pounded and put by for use. Some persons\r\ncalcine it in raw earthen vessels, until the earthenware becomes\r\nthoroughly baked: others again add to it male frankincense.[1622]\r\nVerdigris is washed, too, in the same manner as cadmia.\r\n\r\nIt affords a most useful ingredient for eye-salves, and from its\r\nmordent action is highly beneficial for watery humours of the eyes. It\r\nis necessary, however, to wash the part with warm water, applied with a\r\nfine sponge, until its mordency is no longer felt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—HIERACIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Hieracium”[1623] is the name given to an eye-salve, which is\r\nessentially composed of the following ingredients; four ounces of sal\r\nammoniac, two of Cyprian verdigris, the same quantity of the kind of\r\ncopperas which is called “chalcanthum,”[1624] one ounce of misy[1625]\r\nand six of saffron; all these substances being pounded together with\r\nThasian vinegar and made up into pills. It is an excellent remedy for\r\nincipient glaucoma and cataract, as also for films upon the eyes,\r\neruptions, albugo, and diseases of the eye-lids. Verdigris, in a\r\ncrude state, is also used as an ingredient in plasters for wounds. In\r\ncombination with oil, it is wonderfully efficacious for ulcerations of\r\nthe mouth and gums, and for sore lips. Used in the form of a cerate,\r\nit acts detergently upon ulcers, and promotes their cicatrization.\r\nVerdigris also consumes the callosities of fistulas and excrescences\r\nabout the anus, either used by itself, applied with sal ammoniac, or\r\ninserted in the fistula in the form of a salve. The same substance,\r\nkneaded with one third part of resin of turpentine, removes leprosy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28. (12.)—SCOLEX OF COPPER; EIGHTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of verdigris also, which is called\r\n“scolex.”[1626] It is prepared by triturating in a mortar of Cyprian\r\ncopper, alum and salt, or an equal quantity of nitre, with the very\r\nstrongest white vinegar. This preparation is only made during the\r\nhottest days of the year, about the rising of the Dog-star. The whole\r\nis triturated until it becomes green, and assumes the appearance\r\nof small worms, to which it owes its name. This repulsive form is\r\ncorrected by mixing the urine of a young child, with twice the quantity\r\nof vinegar. Scolex is used for the same medicinal purposes as santerna,\r\nwhich we have described as being used for soldering gold,[1627] and\r\nthey have, both of them, the same properties as verdigris. Native\r\nscolex is also procured by scraping the copper ore of which we are\r\nabout to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—CHALCITIS: SEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nChalcitis[1628] is the name of a mineral, from which, as well as\r\ncadmia, copper is extracted by heat. It differs from cadmia in this\r\nrespect, that this last is procured from beds below the surface,\r\nwhile chalcitis is detached from rocks that are exposed to the air.\r\nChalcitis also becomes immediately friable, being naturally so soft\r\nas to have the appearance of a compressed mass of down. There is also\r\nthis other distinction between them, that chalcitis is a composition\r\nof three other substances, copper, misy, and sory,[1629] of which last\r\nwe shall speak in their appropriate places.[1630] The veins of copper\r\nwhich it contains are oblong. The most approved kind is of the colour\r\nof honey; it is streaked with fine sinuous veins, and is friable and\r\nnot stony. It is generally thought to be most valuable when fresh,\r\nas, when old, it becomes converted into sory. It is highly useful for\r\nremoving fleshy excrescences in ulcers, for arresting hæmorrhage,\r\nand, in the form of a powder, for acting astringently upon the gums,\r\nthe uvula, and the tonsillary glands.[1631] It is applied in wool, as\r\na pessary, for affections of the uterus; and with leek juice it is\r\nformed into plasters for diseases of the genitals. This substance is\r\nmacerated for forty days in vinegar, in an earthen vessel luted with\r\ndung; after which it acquires a saffron colour. When this composition\r\nis mixed with an equal proportion of cadmia, it forms the medicament\r\nknown as “psoricon.”[1632] If two parts of chalcitis are combined with\r\none of cadmia, the medicament becomes more active; and it is rendered\r\nstill more powerful if vinegar is used instead of wine. For all these\r\npurposes, calcined chalcitis is the most efficacious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—SORY: THREE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sory[1633] of Egypt is the most esteemed, being considered much\r\nsuperior to that of Cyprus, Spain, and Africa; although some prefer the\r\nsory from Cyprus for affections of the eyes. But from whatever place\r\nit comes, the best is that which has the strongest odour, and which,\r\nwhen triturated, becomes greasy, black, and spongy. It is a substance\r\nso unpleasant to the stomach, that some persons are made sick merely by\r\nits smell. This is the case more particularly with the sory from Egypt.\r\nThat from other countries, by trituration, acquires the lustre of misy,\r\nand is of a more gritty consistency. Held in the mouth, and used as a\r\ncollutory, it is good for toothache. It is also useful for malignant\r\nulcers of a serpiginous nature. It is calcined upon charcoal, like\r\nchalcitis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—MISY: THIRTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome persons have stated, that misy[1634] is formed by the calcination\r\nof the mineral, in trenches;[1635] its fine yellow powder becoming\r\nmixed with the ashes of the burnt fire-wood. The fact is, however, that\r\nthough obtained from the mineral, it is already formed, and in compact\r\nmasses, which require force to detach them. The best is that which\r\ncomes from the manufactories of Cyprus, its characteristics being, that\r\nwhen broken, it sparkles like gold, and when triturated, it presents a\r\nsandy or earthy appearance, like chalcitis. Misy is used in the process\r\nof refining gold. Mixed with oil of roses, it is used as an injection\r\nfor suppurations of the ears, and, in combination with wool, it is\r\napplied to ulcers of the head. It also removes inveterate granulations\r\nof the eye-lids, and is particularly useful for affections of the\r\ntonsils, quinsy, and suppurations. For these maladies, sixteen drachmæ\r\nshould be mixed with one semisextarius of vinegar, and boiled with the\r\naddition of some honey, until it becomes of a viscous consistency; in\r\nwhich state it is applicable to the different purposes above mentioned.\r\nWhen its action is wanted to be modified, a sprinkling of honey is\r\nadded. A fomentation of misy and vinegar removes the callosities of\r\nfistulous ulcers; it also enters into the composition of eye-salves. It\r\narrests hæmorrhage, prevents the spreading of serpiginous and putrid\r\nulcers, and consumes fleshy excrescences. It is particularly useful\r\nfor diseases of the male generative organs, and acts as a check upon\r\nmenstruation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—CHALCANTHUM, OR SHOEMAKERS’ BLACK: SIXTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, by the name[1636] which they have given to it, have\r\nindicated the relation between shoemakers’ black[1637] and copper; for\r\nthey call it “chalcanthum.”[1638] Indeed there is no substance[1639]\r\nso singular in its nature. It is prepared in Spain, from the water of\r\nwells or pits which contain it in dissolution. This water is boiled\r\nwith an equal quantity of pure water, and is then poured into large\r\nwooden reservoirs. Across these reservoirs there are a number of\r\nimmovable beams, to which cords are fastened, and then sunk into the\r\nwater beneath by means of stones; upon which, a slimy sediment attaches\r\nitself to the cords, in drops of a vitreous[1640] appearance, somewhat\r\nresembling a bunch of grapes. Upon being removed, it is dried for\r\nthirty days. It is of an azure colour, and of a brilliant lustre, and\r\nis often taken for glass. When dissolved, it forms the black dye that\r\nis used for colouring leather.\r\n\r\nChalcanthum is also prepared in various other ways: the earth which\r\ncontains it being sometimes excavated into trenches, from the sides of\r\nwhich globules exude, which become concrete when exposed to the action\r\nof the winter frosts. This kind is called “stalagmia,”[1641] and there\r\nis none more pure. When its colour is nearly white, with a slight tinge\r\nof violet, it is called “lonchoton.”[1642] It is also prepared in pans\r\nhollowed out in the rocks; the rain water carrying the slime into\r\nthem, where it settles and becomes hardened. It is also formed in the\r\nsame way in which we prepare salt;[1643] the intense heat of the sun\r\nseparating the fresh water from it. Hence it is that some distinguish\r\ntwo kinds of chalcanthum, the fossil and the artificial; the latter\r\nbeing paler than the former, and as much inferior to it in quality as\r\nit is in colour.\r\n\r\nThe chalcitis which comes from Cyprus is the most highly esteemed for\r\nthe purposes of medicine, being taken in doses of one drachma with\r\nhoney, as an expellent of intestinal worms. Diluted and injected into\r\nthe nostrils, it acts detergently upon the brain, and, taken with\r\nhoney or with hydromel, it acts as a purgative upon the stomach. It\r\nremoves granulations upon the eye-lids, and is good for pains and\r\nfilms upon the eyes; it is curative also of ulcerations of the mouth.\r\nIt arrests bleeding at the nostrils, and hæmorrhoidal discharges. In\r\ncombination with seed of hyoscyamus, it brings away splinters of broken\r\nbones. Applied to the forehead with a sponge, it acts as a check upon\r\ndefluxions of the eyes. Made up into plasters, it is very efficacious\r\nas a detergent for sores and fleshy excrescences in ulcers. The\r\ndecoction of it, by the contact solely, is curative of swellings of\r\nthe uvula. It is laid with linseed upon plasters which are used for\r\nrelieving pains. The whitish kind is preferred to the violet in one\r\ninstance only, for the purpose of being blown into the ears, through\r\na tube, to relieve deafness. Applied topically by itself, it heals\r\nwounds; but it leaves a discoloration upon the scars. It has been\r\nlately discovered, that if it is sprinkled upon the mouths of bears and\r\nlions in the arena, its astringent action is so powerful as to deprive\r\nthe animals of the power of biting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33. (13.)—POMPHOLYX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substances called pompholyx[1644] and spodos[1645] are also found\r\nin the furnaces of copper-smelting works; the difference between them\r\nbeing, that pompholyx is disengaged by washing, while spodos is not\r\nwashed. Some persons have called the part which is white and very light\r\n“pompholyx,” and say that it is the ashes of copper and cadmia; whereas\r\nspodos is darker and heavier, being a substance scraped from the walls\r\nof the furnace, mixed with extinguished sparks from the metal, and\r\nsometimes with the residue of coals. When vinegar is combined with\r\nit, pompholyx emits a coppery smell, and if it is touched with the\r\ntongue, the taste is most abominable. It is useful as an ingredient in\r\nophthalmic preparations for all diseases of the eyes, as also for all\r\nthe purposes for which spodos is used; this last only differing from it\r\nin its action being less powerful. It is also used for plasters, when\r\nrequired to be gently cooling and desiccative. For all these purposes\r\nit is more efficacious when it has been moistened with wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—SPODOS: FIVE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cyprian spodos[1646] is the best. It is formed by fusing cadmia\r\nwith copper ore. This substance, which is the lightest part of the\r\nmetal disengaged by fusion, escapes from the furnace, and adheres to\r\nthe roof, being distinguished from the soot by the whiteness of its\r\ncolour. Such parts of it as are less white are indicative of incomplete\r\ncombustion, and it is this which some persons call “pompholyx.” Such\r\nportions of it as are of a more reddish colour are possessed of a\r\nmore energetic power, and are found to be so corrosive, that if it\r\ntouches the eyes, while being washed, it will cause blindness. There\r\nis also a spodos of a honey colour, an indication that it contains\r\na large proportion of copper. All the different kinds, however, are\r\nimproved by washing; it being first skimmed with a feather,[1647]\r\nand afterwards submitted to a more substantial washing, the harder\r\ngrains being removed with the finger. That, too, which has been washed\r\nwith wine is more modified in its effects; there being also some\r\ndifference according to the kind of wine that is used. When it has\r\nbeen washed with weak wine the spodos is considered not so beneficial\r\nas an ingredient in medicaments for the eyes; but the same kind of\r\npreparation is more efficacious for running sores, and for ulcers of\r\nthe mouth attended with a discharge of matter, as well as in all those\r\nremedies which are used for gangrene.\r\n\r\nThere is also a kind of spodos, called “lauriotis,”[1648] which is\r\nmade in the furnaces where silver is smelted. The kind, however, that\r\nis best for the eyes, it is said, is that produced in the furnaces\r\nfor smelting gold. Indeed there is no department of art in which the\r\ningenuity of man is more to be admired; for it has discovered among the\r\nvery commonest objects, a substance that is in every way possessed of\r\nsimilar properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—FIFTEEN VARIETIES OF ANTISPODOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substance called “antispodos”[1649] is produced from the ashes\r\nof the fig-tree or wild fig, or of leaves of myrtle, together with\r\nthe more tender shoots of the branches. The leaves, too, of the\r\nwild olive[1650] furnish it, the cultivated olive, the quince-tree,\r\nand the lentisk; unripe mulberries also, before they have changed\r\ntheir colour, dried in the sun; and the foliage of the box,\r\npseudo-cypirus,[1651] bramble, terebinth and œnanthe.[1652] The same\r\nvirtues have also been found in the ashes of bull-glue[1653] and of\r\nlinen cloth. All these substances are burnt in a pot of raw earth,\r\nwhich is heated in a furnace, until the earthenware is thoroughly baked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—SMEGMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the copper forges also smegma[1654] is prepared. When the metal is\r\nliquefied and thoroughly smelted, charcoal is added to it and gradually\r\nkindled; after which, upon it being suddenly acted upon by a powerful\r\npair of bellows, a substance is disengaged like a sort of copper chaff.\r\nThe floor on which it is received ought to be prepared with a stratum\r\nof coal-dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—DIPHRYX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another product of these furnaces, which is easily\r\ndistinguished from smegma, and which the Greeks call “diphryx,”[1655]\r\nfrom its being twice calcined. This substance is prepared from three\r\ndifferent sources. It is prepared, they say, from a mineral pyrites,\r\nwhich is heated in the furnace until it is converted by calcination\r\ninto a red earth. It is also made in Cyprus, from a slimy substance\r\nextracted from a certain cavern there, which is first dried and then\r\ngradually heated, by a fire made of twigs. A third way of making it, is\r\nfrom the residue in the copper-furnaces that falls to the bottom. The\r\ndifference between the component parts of the ore is this: the copper\r\nitself runs into the receivers, the scoriæ make their escape from the\r\nfurnace, the flower becomes sublimated, and the diphryx remains behind.\r\n\r\nSome say that there are certain globules in the ore, while being\r\nsmelted, which become soldered together; and that the rest of the metal\r\nis fused around it, the mass itself not becoming liquefied, unless it\r\nis transferred to another furnace, and forming a sort of knot, as it\r\nwere, in the metal. That which remains after the fusion, they say,\r\nis called “diphryx.” Its use in medicine is similar to that of the\r\nsubstances mentioned above;[1656] it is desiccative, removes morbid\r\nexcrescenses, and acts as a detergent. It is tested by placing it\r\non the tongue, which ought to be instantly parched by it, a coppery\r\nflavour being perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO THE SERVILIAN TRIENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not neglect to mention one other very remarkable fact\r\nrelative to copper. The Servilian family, so illustrious in our\r\nannals, nourishes with gold and silver a copper triens,[1657] which\r\ndevours them both. The origin and nature of this coin is to me\r\nincomprehensible;[1658] but I will quote the very words of the story,\r\nas given by old Messala[1659] himself—“The family of the Servilii is\r\nin possession of a sacred triens, to which they offer every year a\r\nsacrifice, with the greatest care and magnificence; the triens itself,\r\nthey say, appears sometimes to increase in size and sometimes to\r\ndiminish; changes which indicate the coming advancement or decadence of\r\nthe family.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39 (14).—IRON ORES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to copper we must give an account of the metal known as iron, at\r\nthe same time the most useful and the most fatal instrument in the hand\r\nof mankind. For by the aid of iron we lay open the ground, we plant\r\ntrees, we prepare our vineyard-trees,[1660] and we force our vines each\r\nyear to resume their youthful state, by cutting away their decayed\r\nbranches. It is by the aid of iron that we construct houses, cleave\r\nrocks, and perform so many other useful offices of life. But it is with\r\niron also that wars, murders, and robberies are effected, and this, not\r\nonly hand to hand, but from a distance even, by the aid of missiles\r\nand winged weapons, now launched from engines, now hurled by the human\r\narm, and now furnished with feathery wings. This last I regard as the\r\nmost criminal artifice that has been devised by the human mind; for, as\r\nif to bring death upon man with still greater rapidity, we have given\r\nwings to iron and taught it to fly.[1661] Let us therefore acquit\r\nNature of a charge that here belongs to man himself.[1662]\r\n\r\nIndeed there have been some instances in which it has been proved that\r\niron might be solely used for innocent purposes. In the treaty which\r\nPorsena granted to the Roman people, after the expulsion of the kings,\r\nwe find it expressly stipulated, that iron shall be only employed for\r\nthe cultivation of the fields; and our oldest authors inform us, that\r\nin those days it was considered unsafe to write with an iron pen.[1663]\r\nThere is an edict extant, published in the third consulship of Pompeius\r\nMagnus, during the tumults that ensued upon the death of Clodius,\r\nprohibiting any weapon from being retained in the City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—STATUES OF IRON; CHASED WORKS IN IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, however, human industry has not failed to employ iron\r\nfor perpetuating the honours of more civilized life. The artist\r\nAristonidas, wishing to express the fury of Athamas subsiding into\r\nrepentance, after he had thrown his son Learchus from the rock,[1664]\r\nblended copper and iron, in order that the blush of shame might be\r\nmore exactly expressed, by the rust of the iron making its appearance\r\nthrough the shining substance of the copper; a statue which still\r\nexists at Rhodes. There is also, in the same city, a Hercules of\r\niron, executed by Alcon,[1665] the endurance displayed in his labours\r\nby the god having suggested the idea. We see too, at Rome, cups of\r\niron consecrated in the Temple of Mars the Avenger.[1666] Nature, in\r\nconformity with her usual benevolence, has limited the power of iron,\r\nby inflicting upon it the punishment of rust; and has thus displayed\r\nher usual foresight in rendering nothing in existence more perishable,\r\nthan the substance which brings the greatest dangers upon perishable\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF IRON, AND THE MODE OF TEMPERING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIron ores are to be found almost everywhere; for they exist even in\r\nthe Italian island of Ilva,[1667] being easily distinguished by the\r\nferruginous colour of the earth. The method of working the ore is the\r\nsame as that employed in the case of copper. In Cappadocia, however,\r\nit is peculiarly questionable whether this metal is present due to the\r\nwater or to the earth; because, when the latter has been saturated with\r\nthe water of a certain river, it yields, and then only, an iron that\r\nmay be obtained by smelting.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous varieties of iron ore; the chief causes of which\r\narise from differences in the soil and in the climate. Some earths\r\nproduce a metal that is soft, and nearly akin to lead; others an iron\r\nthat is brittle and coppery, the use of which must be particularly\r\navoided in making wheels or nails, the former kind being better for\r\nthese purposes. There is another kind, again, which is only esteemed\r\nwhen cut into short lengths, and is used for making hobnails;[1668] and\r\nanother which is more particularly liable to rust. All these varieties\r\nare known by the name of “strictura,”[1669] an appellation which is not\r\nused with reference to the other metals, and is derived from the steel\r\nthat is used for giving an edge.[1670] There is a great difference,\r\ntoo, in the smelting; some kinds producing knurrs of metal, which are\r\nespecially adapted for hardening into steel, or else, prepared in\r\nanother manner, for making thick anvils or heads of hammers. But the\r\nmain difference results from the quality of the water into which the\r\nred-hot metal is plunged from time to time. The water, which is in\r\nsome places better for this purpose than in others, has quite ennobled\r\nsome localities for the excellence of their iron, Bilbilis,[1671] for\r\nexample, and Turiasso[1672] in Spain, and Comum[1673] in Italy; and\r\nthis, although there are no iron mines in these spots.\r\n\r\nBut of all the different kinds of iron, the palm of excellence is\r\nawarded to that which is made by the Seres,[1674] who send it to us\r\nwith their tissues and skins;[1675] next to which, in quality, is the\r\nParthian[1676] iron. Indeed, none of the other kinds of iron are made\r\nof the pure hard metal, a softer alloy being welded with them all. In\r\nour part of the world, a vein of ore is occasionally found to yield\r\na metal of this high quality, as in Noricum[1677] for instance; but,\r\nin other cases, it derives its value from the mode of working it,\r\nas at Sulmo,[1678] for example, a result owing to the nature of its\r\nwater, as already stated. It is to be observed also, that in giving an\r\nedge to iron, there is a great difference between oil-whetstones and\r\nwater-whetstones,[1679] the use of oil producing a much finer edge. It\r\nis a remarkable fact, that when the ore is fused, the metal becomes\r\nliquefied like water, and afterwards acquires a spongy, brittle\r\ntexture. It is the practice to quench smaller articles made of iron\r\nwith oil, lest by being hardened in water they should be rendered\r\nbrittle. Human blood revenges itself upon iron; for if the metal has\r\nbeen once touched by this blood it is much more apt to become rusty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—THE METAL CALLED LIVE IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall speak of the loadstone in its proper place,[1680] and of the\r\nsympathy which it has with iron. This is the only metal that acquires\r\nthe properties of that stone, retaining them for a length of time,\r\nand attracting other iron, so that we may sometimes see a whole chain\r\nformed of these rings. The lower classes, in their ignorance, call this\r\n“live iron,” and the wounds that are made by it are much more severe.\r\nThis mineral is also found in Cantabria, not in continuous strata,\r\nlike the genuine loadstone, but in scattered fragments, which they\r\ncall “bullationes.”[1681] I do not know whether this species of ore\r\nis proper also for the fusion of glass,[1682] as no one has hitherto\r\ntried it; but it certainly imparts the same property as the magnet to\r\niron. The architect Timochares,[1683] began to erect a vaulted roof of\r\nloadstone, in the Temple of Arsinoë,[1684] at Alexandria, in order that\r\nthe iron statue of that princess might have the appearance of hanging\r\nsuspended in the air:[1685] his death, however, and that of King\r\nPtolemæus, who had ordered this monument to be erected in honour of his\r\nsister, prevented the completion of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (15.)—METHODS OE PREVENTING RUST.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all metals, the ores of iron are found in the greatest abundance. In\r\nthe maritime parts of Cantabria[1686] which are washed by the Ocean,\r\nthere is a steep and lofty mountain, which, however incredible it may\r\nappear, is entirely composed of this metal, as already stated in our\r\ndescription of the parts bordering upon the Ocean.[1687]\r\n\r\nIron which has been acted upon by fire is spoiled, unless it is forged\r\nwith the hammer. It is not in a fit state for being hammered when it\r\nis red-hot, nor, indeed, until it has begun to assume a white heat.\r\nBy sprinkling vinegar or alum upon it, it acquires the appearance of\r\ncopper. It is protected from rust by an application of ceruse, gypsum,\r\nand tar; a property of iron known by the Greeks as “antipathia.”[1688]\r\nSome pretend, too, that this may be ensured by the performance of\r\ncertain religious ceremonies, and that there is in existence at the\r\ncity of Zeugma,[1689] upon the Euphrates, an iron chain, by means of\r\nwhich Alexander the Great constructed a bridge across the river; the\r\nlinks of which that have been replaced are attacked with rust, while\r\nthe original links are totally exempt from it.[1690]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—SEVEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIron is employed in medicine for other purposes besides that of making\r\nincisions. For if a circle is traced with iron, or a pointed weapon\r\nis carried three times round them, it will preserve both infant and\r\nadult from all noxious influences: if nails, too, that have been\r\nextracted from a tomb, are driven into the threshold of a door, they\r\nwill prevent night-mare.[1691] A slight puncture with the point of a\r\nweapon, with which a man has been wounded, will relieve sudden pains,\r\nattended with stitches in the sides or chest. Some affections are\r\ncured by cauterization with red-hot iron, the bite of the mad dog more\r\nparticularly; for even if the malady has been fully developed, and\r\nhydrophobia has made its appearance, the patient is instantly relieved\r\non the wound being cauterized.[1692] Water in which iron has been\r\nplunged at a white heat, is useful, as a potion, in many diseases,\r\ndysentery[1693] more particularly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—FOURTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM RUST.\r\n\r\n\r\nRust itself, too, is classed among the remedial substances; for it was\r\nby means of it that Achilles cured Telephus, it is said, whether it\r\nwas an iron weapon or a brazen one that he used for the purpose. So it\r\nis, however, that he is represented in paintings detaching the rust\r\nwith his sword.[1694] The rust of iron is usually obtained for these\r\npurposes by scraping old nails with a piece of moistened iron. It has\r\nthe effect of uniting wounds, and is possessed of certain desiccative\r\nand astringent properties. Applied in the form of a liniment, it is\r\ncurative of alopecy. Mixed with wax and myrtle-oil, it is applied to\r\ngranulations of the eyelids, and pustules in all parts of the body;\r\nwith vinegar it is used for the cure of erysipelas; and, applied with\r\nlint, it is curative of itch, whitlows on the fingers, and hang-nails.\r\nUsed as a pessary with wool, it arrests female discharges. Diluted in\r\nwine, and kneaded with myrrh, it is applied to recent wounds, and,\r\nwith vinegar, to condylomatous swellings. Employed in the form of a\r\nliniment, it alleviates gout.[1695]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—SEVENTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SCALES OF IRON.\r\nHYGREMPLASTRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scales of iron,[1696] which are procured from a fine point or a\r\nsharp edge, are also made use of, being very similar in effect to rust,\r\nbut more active; for which reason they are employed for defluxions of\r\nthe eyes. They arrest bleeding, also, more particularly from wounds\r\ninflicted with iron; and they act as a check upon female discharges.\r\nThey are applied, too, for diseases of the spleen, and they arrest\r\nhæmorrhoidal swellings and serpiginous ulcers. They are useful also\r\nfor affections of the eyelids, gradually applied in the form of a fine\r\npowder. But their chief recommendation is, their great utility in the\r\nform of a hygremplastrum[1697] or wet plaster, for cleansing wounds and\r\nfistulous sores, consuming all kinds of callosities, and making new\r\nflesh on bones that are denuded. The following are the ingredients: of\r\npitch, six oboli, of Cimolian chalk,[1698] six drachmæ, two drachmæ of\r\npounded copper, the same quantity of scales of iron, six drachmæ of\r\nwax, and one sextarius of oil. To these is added some cerate, when it\r\nis wanted to cleanse or fill up wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47. (16.)—THE ORES OF LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of lead next comes to be considered. There are two kinds of\r\nit, the black and the white.[1699] The white is the most valuable: it\r\nwas called by the Greeks “cassiteros,”[1700] and there is a fabulous\r\nstory told of their going in quest of it to the islands of the\r\nAtlantic, and of its being brought in barks made of osiers, covered\r\nwith hides.[1701] It is now known that it is a production of Lusitania\r\nand Gallæcia.[1702] It is a sand found on the surface of the earth,\r\nand of a black colour, and is only to be detected by its weight. It is\r\nmingled with small pebbles, particularly in the dried beds of rivers.\r\nThe miners wash this sand, and calcine the deposit in the furnace. It\r\nis also found in the gold mines that are known as “alutiæ,”[1703] the\r\nstream of water which is passed through them detaching certain black\r\npebbles, mottled with small white spots and of the same weight[1704]\r\nas gold. Hence it is that they remain with the gold in the baskets in\r\nwhich it is collected; and being separated in the furnace, are then\r\nmelted, and become converted into white lead.[1705]\r\n\r\nBlack lead is not procured in Gallæcia, although it is so greatly\r\nabundant in the neighbouring province of Cantabria; nor is silver\r\nprocured from white lead, although it is from black.[1706] Pieces of\r\nblack lead cannot be soldered without the intervention of white lead,\r\nnor can this be done without employing oil;[1707] nor can white lead,\r\non the other hand, be united without the aid of black lead. White lead\r\nwas held in estimation in the days even of the Trojan War, a fact that\r\nis attested by Homer, who calls it “cassiteros.”[1708] There are two\r\ndifferent sources of black lead: it being procured either from its own\r\nnative ore, where it is produced without the intermixture of any other\r\nsubstance, or else from an ore which contains it in common with silver,\r\nthe two metals being fused together. The metal which first becomes\r\nliquid in the furnace, is called “stannum;”[1709] the next that melts\r\nis silver; and the metal that remains behind is galena,[1710] the third\r\nconstituent part of the mineral. On this last being again submitted to\r\nfusion black lead is produced, with a deduction of two-ninths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48. (17.)—STANNUM. ARGENTARIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen copper vessels are coated with stannum,[1711] they produce a less\r\ndisagreeable flavour, and the formation of verdigris is prevented; it\r\nis also remarkable, that the weight of the vessel is not increased.\r\nAs already mentioned,[1712] the finest mirrors were formerly prepared\r\nfrom it at Brundisium, until everybody, our maid-servants even, began\r\nto use silver ones. At the present day a counterfeit stannum is made,\r\nby adding one-third of white copper to two-thirds of white lead.[1713]\r\nIt is also counterfeited in another way, by mixing together equal\r\nparts of white lead and black lead; this last being what is called\r\n“argentarium.”[1714] There is also a composition called “tertiarium,”\r\na mixture of two parts of black lead and one of white: its price is\r\ntwenty denarii per pound, and it is used for soldering pipes. Persons\r\nstill more dishonest mix together[1715] equal parts of tertiarium and\r\nwhite lead, and, calling the compound “argentarium,” coat articles with\r\nit melted. This last sells at sixty denarii per ten pounds, the price\r\nof the pure unmixed white lead being eighty denarii, and of the black\r\nseven.[1716]\r\n\r\nWhite lead is naturally more dry; while the black, on the contrary, is\r\nalways moist; consequently the white, without being mixed with another\r\nmetal, is of no use[1717] for anything. Silver too, cannot be soldered\r\nwith it, because the silver becomes fused before the white lead. It is\r\nconfidently stated, also, that if too small a proportion of black lead\r\nis mixed with the white, this last will corrode the silver. It was in\r\nthe Gallic provinces that the method was discovered of coating articles\r\nof copper with white lead, so as to be scarcely distinguishable from\r\nsilver: articles thus plated are known as “incoctilia.”[1718] At a\r\nlater period, the people of the town of Alesia[1719] began to use a\r\nsimilar process for plating articles with silver, more particularly\r\nornaments for horses, beasts of burden, and yokes of oxen: the merit,\r\nhowever, of this invention belongs to the Bituriges.[1720] After this,\r\nthey began to ornament their esseda, colisata, and petorita[1721] in a\r\nsimilar manner; and luxury has at last arrived at such a pitch, that\r\nnot only are their decorations made of silver, but of gold even, and\r\nwhat was formerly a marvel to behold on a cup, is now subjected to the\r\nwear and tear of a carriage, and this in obedience to what they call\r\nfashion!\r\n\r\nWhite lead is tested, by pouring it, melted,[1722] upon paper, which\r\nought to have the appearance of being torn rather by the weight than by\r\nthe heat of the metal. India has neither copper nor lead,[1723] but she\r\nprocures them in exchange for her precious stones and pearls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—BLACK LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlack lead[1724] is used in the form of pipes and sheets: it is\r\nextracted with great labour in Spain, and throughout all the Gallic\r\nprovinces; but in Britannia[1725] it is found in the upper stratum of\r\nthe earth, in such abundance, that a law has been spontaneously made,\r\nprohibiting any one from working more than a certain quantity of it.\r\nThe various kinds of black lead are known by the following names—the\r\nOvetanian,[1726] the Caprariensian,[1727] and the Oleastrensian.[1728]\r\nThere is no difference whatever in them, when the scoria has been\r\ncarefully removed by calcination. It is a marvellous fact, that these\r\nmines, and these only, when they have been abandoned for some time,\r\nbecome replenished, and are more prolific than before. This would\r\nappear to be effected by the air, infusing itself at liberty through\r\nthe open orifices, just as some women become more prolific after\r\nabortion. This was lately found to be the case with the Santarensian\r\nmine in Bætica;[1729] which, after being farmed at an annual rental\r\nof two hundred thousand denarii, and then abandoned, is now rented at\r\ntwo hundred and fifty-five thousand per annum. In the same manner, the\r\nAntonian mine in the same province has had the rent raised to four\r\nhundred thousand sesterces per annum.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that if we pour water into a vessel of lead,\r\nit will not melt; but that if we throw into the water a pebble or a\r\ncopper quadrans,[1730] the vessel will be penetrated by the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50. (18.)—FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nLead is used in medicine, without any addition, for the removal of\r\nscars; if it is applied, too, in plates, to the region of the loins\r\nand kidneys, in consequence of its cold nature it will restrain the\r\nvenereal passions, and put an end to libidinous dreams at night,\r\nattended with spontaneous emissions, and assuming all the form of a\r\ndisease. The orator Calvus, it is said, effected a cure for himself by\r\nmeans of these plates, and so preserved his bodily energies for labour\r\nand study. The Emperor Nero—for so the gods willed it—could never sing\r\nto the full pitch of his voice, unless he had a plate of lead upon\r\nhis chest; thus showing us one method of preserving the voice.[1731]\r\nFor medicinal purposes the lead is melted in earthen vessels; a layer\r\nof finely powdered sulphur being placed beneath, very thin plates\r\nof lead are laid upon it, and are then covered with a mixture of\r\nsulphur and iron. While it is being melted, all the apertures in the\r\nvessel should be closed, otherwise a noxious vapour is discharged\r\nfrom the furnace, of a deadly nature, to dogs in particular. Indeed,\r\nthe vapours from all metals destroy flies and gnats; and hence it is\r\nthat in mines there are none of those annoyances.[1732] Some persons,\r\nduring the process, mix lead-filings with the sulphur, while others\r\nsubstitute ceruse for sulphur. By washing, a preparation is made from\r\nlead, that is much employed in medicine: for this purpose, a leaden\r\nmortar, containing rain water, is beaten with a pestle of lead, until\r\nthe water has assumed a thick consistency; which done, the water that\r\nfloats on the surface is removed with a sponge, and the thicker part\r\nof the sediment is left to dry, and is then divided into tablets. Some\r\npersons triturate lead-filings in this way, and some mix with it lead\r\nore, or else vinegar, wine, grease, or rose-leaves. Others, again,\r\nprefer triturating the lead in a stone mortar, one of Thebaic stone\r\nmore particularly, with a pestle of lead; by which process a whiter\r\npreparation is obtained.\r\n\r\nAs to calcined lead, it is washed, like stibi[1733] and cadmia.\r\nIts action is astringent and repressive, and it is promotive of\r\ncicatrization. The same substance is also employed in preparations for\r\nthe eyes, cases of procidence[1734] of those organs more particularly;\r\nalso for filling up the cavities left by ulcers, and for removing\r\nexcrescences and fissures of the anus, as well as hæmorrhoidal and\r\ncondylomatous tumours. For all these purposes the lotion of lead\r\nis particularly useful; but for serpiginous or sordid ulcers it is\r\nthe ashes of calcined lead that are used, these producing the same\r\nadvantageous effects as ashes of burnt papyrus.[1735]\r\n\r\nThe lead is calcined in thin plates, laid with sulphur in shallow\r\nvessels, the mixture being stirred with iron rods or stalks of\r\nfennel-giant, until the melted metal becomes calcined; when cold, it is\r\npulverized. Some persons calcine lead-filings in a vessel of raw earth,\r\nwhich they leave in the furnace, until the earthenware is completely\r\nbaked. Others, again, mix with it an equal quantity of ceruse or of\r\nbarley, and triturate it in the way mentioned for raw lead; indeed,\r\nthe lead which has been prepared this way is preferred to the spodium\r\nof Cyprus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—FIFTEEN REMEDIES DERIVED FROM THE SCORIA OF LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scoria[1736] of lead is also made use of; the best kind being that\r\nwhich approaches nearest to a yellow colour, without any vestiges of\r\nlead, or which has the appearance of sulphur without any terreous\r\nparticles. It is broken into small pieces and washed in a mortar,\r\nuntil the mortar assumes a yellow colour; after which, it is poured\r\noff into a clean vessel, the process being repeated until it deposits\r\na sediment, which is a substance of the greatest utility. It possesses\r\nthe same properties as lead, but of a more active nature. How truly\r\nwonderful is the knowledge which we gain by experiment, when even the\r\nvery dregs and foul residues of substances have in so many ways been\r\ntested by mankind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—SPODIUM OF LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA spodium[1737] of lead is also prepared in the same manner as that\r\nextracted from Cyprian copper.[1738] It is washed with rain water,\r\nin linen of a loose texture, and the earthy parts are separated by\r\npouring it off; after which it is sifted, and then pounded. Some prefer\r\nremoving the fine powder with a feather, and then triturating it with\r\naromatic wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—MOLYBDÆNA: FIFTEEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMolybdæna,[1739] which in another place I have called “galena,”[1740]\r\nis a mineral compounded of silver and lead. It is considered better in\r\nquality the nearer it approaches to a golden colour and the less lead\r\nit contains; it is also friable, and of moderate weight. When it is\r\nmelted with oil, it acquires the colour of liver. It is found adhering\r\nalso to the furnaces in which gold and silver have been smelted;\r\nand in this case it is called “metallic.” The most esteemed kind is\r\nthat prepared at Zephyrium.[1741] Those kinds, too, are considered\r\nthe best that are the least earthy and the least stony. It is used in\r\npreparing liparæ,[1742] as also for soothing or cooling ulcers, and as\r\nan ingredient in plasters, which are applied without ligatures, but\r\nare used only as a liniment for producing cicatrization on the bodies\r\nof delicate persons and the more tender parts. The composition is made\r\nof three pounds of molybdæna, one pound of wax, and three heminæ of\r\noil; to which are added lees of olives, in the case of aged persons.\r\nCombined with scum of silver[1743] and scoria of lead, it is employed\r\nwarm in fomentations for dysentery and tenesmus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—PSIMITHIUM, OR CERUSE; SIX REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsimithium,[1744] which is also known as ceruse, is another production\r\nof the lead-works. The most esteemed comes from Rhodes. It is made\r\nfrom very fine shavings of lead, placed over a vessel filled with\r\nthe strongest vinegar; by which means the shavings become dissolved.\r\nThat which falls into the vinegar is first dried, and then pounded\r\nand sifted, after which it is again mixed with vinegar, and is then\r\ndivided into tablets and dried in the sun, during summer. It is also\r\nmade in another way; the lead is thrown into jars filled with vinegar,\r\nwhich are kept closed for ten days; the sort of mould that forms upon\r\nthe surface is then scraped off, and the lead is again put into the\r\nvinegar, until the whole of the metal is consumed. The part that has\r\nbeen scraped off is triturated and sifted, and then melted in shallow\r\nvessels, being stirred with ladles, until the substance becomes red,\r\nand assumes the appearance of sandarach. It is then washed with fresh\r\nwater, until all the cloudy impurities have disappeared, after which it\r\nis dried as before, and divided into tablets.\r\n\r\nIts properties are the same as those of the substances above\r\nmentioned.[1745] It is, however, the mildest of all the preparations of\r\nlead; in addition to which, it is also used by females to whiten the\r\ncomplexion.[1746] It is, however, like scum of silver, a deadly poison.\r\nMelted a second time, ceruse becomes red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—SANDARACH; ELEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned nearly all the properties of sandarach.[1747]\r\nIt is found both in gold-mines and in silver-mines. The redder it is,\r\nthe more pure and friable, and the more powerful its odour, the better\r\nit is in quality. It is detergent, astringent, heating, and corrosive,\r\nbut is most remarkable for its septic properties. Applied topically\r\nwith vinegar, it is curative of alopecy. It is also employed as an\r\ningredient in ophthalmic preparations. Used with honey, it cleanses the\r\nfauces and makes the voice more clear and harmonious. Taken with the\r\nfood, in combination with turpentine, it is a pleasant cure for cough\r\nand asthma. In the form of a fumigation also, with cedar, it has a\r\nremedial effect upon those complaints.[1748]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—ARRHENICUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrhenicum,[1749] too, is procured from the same sources. The best in\r\nquality is of the colour of the finest gold; that which is of a paler\r\nhue, or resembling sandarach, being less esteemed. There is a third\r\nkind also, the colour of which is a mixture of that of gold and of\r\nsandarach. The last two kinds are both of them scaly, but the other\r\nis dry and pure, and divides into delicate long veins.[1750] This\r\nsubstance has the same virtues as the one last mentioned, but is more\r\nactive in its effects. Hence it is that it enters into the composition\r\nof cauteries and depilatory preparations. It is also used for the\r\nremoval of hangnails, polypi of the nostrils, condylomatous tumours,\r\nand other kinds of excrescences. For the purpose of increasing its\r\nenergies, it is heated in a new earthen vessel, until it changes its\r\ncolour.[1751]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remedies, one hundred and fifty-eight.

(1.)—THE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now given at considerable length an account of the nature of\r\nmetals, which constitute our wealth, and of the substances that are\r\nderived from them; so connecting my various subjects, as, at the\r\nsame time, to describe an immense number of medicinal compositions\r\nwhich they furnish, the mysteries[1787] thrown upon them by the\r\ndruggists, and the tedious minutiæ of the arts of chasing,[1788] and\r\nstatuary,[1789] and of dyeing.[1790] It remains for me to describe\r\nthe various kinds of earths and stones; a still more extensive series\r\nof subjects, each of which has been treated of, by the Greeks more\r\nparticularly, in a great number of volumes. For my own part, I propose\r\nto employ a due degree of brevity, at the same time omitting nothing\r\nthat is necessary or that is a product of Nature.\r\n\r\nI shall begin then with what still remains to be said with reference to\r\npainting, an art which was formerly illustrious, when it was held in\r\nesteem both by kings and peoples, and ennobling those whom it deigned\r\nto transmit to posterity. But at the present day, it is completely\r\nbanished in favour of marble, and even gold. For not only are whole\r\nwalls now covered with marble, but the marble itself is carved out or\r\nelse marqueted so as to represent objects and animals of various kinds.\r\nNo longer now are we satisfied with formal compartitions of marble,\r\nor with slabs extended like so many mountains in our chambers, but we\r\nmust begin to paint the very stone itself! This art was invented in the\r\nreign of Claudius, but it was in the time of Nero that we discovered\r\nthe method of inserting in marble spots that do not belong to it, and\r\nso varying its uniformity; and this, for the purpose of representing\r\nthe marble of Numidia[1791] variegated with ovals, and that of\r\nSynnada[1792] veined with purple; just, in fact, as luxury might have\r\nwilled that Nature should produce them. Such are our resources when the\r\nquarries fail us, and luxury ceases not to busy itself, in order that\r\nas much as possible may be lost whenever a conflagration happens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2. (2.)—THE HONOUR ATTACHED TO PORTRAITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrect portraits of individuals were formerly transmitted to future\r\nages by painting; but this has now completely fallen into desuetude.\r\nBrazen shields are now set up, and silver faces, with only some obscure\r\ntraces of the countenance;[1793] the very heads, too, of statues are\r\nchanged,[1794] a thing that has given rise before now to many a current\r\nsarcastic line; so true it is that people prefer showing off the\r\nvaluable material, to having a faithful likeness. And yet, at the same\r\ntime, we tapestry the walls of our galleries with old pictures, and we\r\nprize the portraits of strangers; while as to those made in honour of\r\nourselves, we esteem them only for the value of the material, for some\r\nheir to break up and melt, and so forestall the noose and slip-knot of\r\nthe thief.[1795] Thus it is that we possess the portraits of no living\r\nindividuals, and leave behind us the pictures of our wealth, not of our\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the very same persons adorn the palæstra and the\r\nanointing-room[1796] with portraits of athletes, and both hang up\r\nin their chamber and carry about them a likeness of Epicurus.[1797]\r\nOn the twentieth day of each moon they celebrate his birthday[1798]\r\nby a sacrifice, and keep his festival, known as the “Icas,”[1799]\r\nevery month: and these too, people who wish to live without being\r\nknown![1800] So it is, most assuredly, our indolence has lost sight\r\nof the arts, and since our minds are destitute of any characteristic\r\nfeatures, those of our bodies are neglected also.\r\n\r\nBut on the contrary, in the days of our ancestors, it was these that\r\nwere to be seen in their halls, and not statues made by foreign\r\nartists, or works in bronze or marble: portraits modelled in wax[1801]\r\nwere arranged, each in its separate niche, to be always in readiness\r\nto accompany the funeral processions of the family;[1802] occasions\r\non which every member of the family that had ever existed was always\r\npresent. The pedigree, too, of the individual was traced in lines upon\r\neach of these coloured portraits. Their muniment-rooms,[1803] too,\r\nwere filled with archives and memoirs, stating what each had done\r\nwhen holding the magistracy. On the outside, again, of their houses,\r\nand around the thresholds of their doors, were placed other statues\r\nof those mighty spirits, in the spoils of the enemy there affixed,\r\nmemorials which a purchaser even was not allowed to displace; so that\r\nthe very house continued to triumph even after it had changed its\r\nmaster. A powerful stimulus to emulation this, when the walls each\r\nday reproached an unwarlike owner for having thus intruded upon the\r\ntriumphs of another! There is still extant an address by the orator\r\nMessala, full of indignation, in which he forbids that there should be\r\ninserted among the images of his family any of those of the stranger\r\nrace of the Lævini.[1804] It was the same feeling, too, that extorted\r\nfrom old Messala those compilations of his “On the Families of Rome;”\r\nwhen, upon passing through the hall of Scipio Pomponianus,[1805]\r\nhe observed that, in consequence of a testamentary adoption, the\r\nSalvittos[1806]—for that had been their surname—to the disgrace of\r\nthe Africani, had surreptitiously contrived to assume the name of the\r\nScipios. But the Messalas must pardon me if I remark, that to lay a\r\nclaim, though an untruthful one, to the statues of illustrious men,\r\nshows some love for their virtues, and is much more honourable than to\r\nhave such a character as to merit that no one should wish to claim them.\r\n\r\nThere is a new invention too, which we must not omit to notice. Not\r\nonly do we consecrate in our libraries, in gold or silver, or at all\r\nevents, in bronze, those whose immortal spirits hold converse with\r\nus in those places, but we even go so far as to reproduce the ideal\r\nof features, all remembrance of which has ceased to exist; and our\r\nregrets give existence to likenesses that have not been transmitted\r\nto us, as in the case of Homer, for example.[1807] And indeed, it is\r\nmy opinion, that nothing can be a greater proof of having achieved\r\nsuccess in life, than a lasting desire on the part of one’s fellow-men,\r\nto know what one’s features were. This practice of grouping portraits\r\nwas first introduced at Rome by Asinius Pollio, who was also the\r\nfirst to establish a public library, and so make the works of genius\r\nthe property of the public. Whether the kings of Alexandria and of\r\nPergamus, who had so energetically rivalled each other in forming\r\nlibraries, had previously introduced this practice, I cannot so easily\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nThat a strong passion for portraits formerly existed, is attested\r\nboth by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who wrote a work on this\r\nsubject,[1808] and by M. Varro, who conceived the very liberal idea of\r\ninserting, by some means[1809] or other, in his numerous volumes, the\r\nportraits of seven hundred individuals; as he could not bear the idea\r\nthat all traces of their features should be lost, or that the lapse of\r\ncenturies should get the better of mankind. Thus was he the inventor\r\nof a benefit to his fellow-men, that might have been envied by the gods\r\nthemselves; for not only did he confer upon them immortality, but he\r\ntransmitted them, too, to all parts of the earth; so that everywhere\r\nit might be possible for them to be present, and for each to occupy\r\nhis niche. This service, too, Varro conferred upon persons who were no\r\nmembers of his own family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (3.)—WHEN SHIELDS WERE FIRST INVENTED WITH PORTRAITS UPON\r\nTHEM; AND WHEN THEY WERE FIRST ERECTED IN PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as I can learn, Appius Claudius, who was consul with P.\r\nServilius, in the year of the City, 259, was the first to dedicate\r\nshields[1810] in honour of his own family in a sacred or public\r\nplace.[1811] For he placed representations of his ancestors in the\r\nTemple of Bellona, and desired that they might be erected in an\r\nelevated spot, so as to be seen, and the inscriptions reciting their\r\nhonours read. A truly graceful device; more particularly when a\r\nmultitude of children, represented by so many tiny figures, displays\r\nthose germs, as it were, which are destined to continue the line:\r\nshields such as these, no one can look at without a feeling of pleasure\r\nand lively interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—WHEN THESE SHIELDS WERE FIRST PLACED IN PRIVATE HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore recently, M. Æmilius, who was consul[1812] with Quintus Lutatius,\r\nnot only erected these shields in the Æmilian Basilica,[1813] but in\r\nhis own house as well; in doing which he followed a truly warlike\r\nexample. For, in fact, these portraits were represented on bucklers,\r\nsimilar to those used in the Trojan War;[1814] and hence it is that\r\nthese shields received their present name of “clypei,” and not, as\r\nthe perverse subtleties of the grammarians will have it, from the\r\nword “cluo.”[1815] It was an abundant motive for valour, when upon\r\neach shield was represented the features of him who had borne it. The\r\nCarthaginians used to make both their bucklers and their portraits\r\nof gold, and to carry them with them in the camp: at all events,\r\nMarcius, the avenger of the Scipios[1816] in Spain, found one of this\r\nkind on capturing the camp of Hasdrubal, and it was this same buckler\r\nthat remained suspended over the gate of the Capitoline Temple until\r\nthe time when it was first burnt.[1817] Indeed, in the days of our\r\nancestors, so assured was the safety of these shields, that it has\r\nbeen a subject of remark, that in the consulship of L. Manlius and\r\nQ. Fulvius, in the year of the City, 575, M. Aufidius, who had given\r\nsecurity for the safety of the Capitol, informed the senate that the\r\nbucklers there which for some lustra[1818] had been assessed as copper,\r\nwere in reality made of silver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ART OF PAINTING. MONOCHROME PAINTINGS.\r\nTHE EARLIEST PAINTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have no certain knowledge as to the commencement of the art\r\nof painting, nor does this enquiry fall under our consideration.\r\nThe Egyptians assert that it was invented among themselves, six\r\nthousand years before it passed into Greece; a vain boast, it is very\r\nevident.[1819] As to the Greeks, some say that it was invented at\r\nSicyon, others at Corinth; but they all agree that it originated in\r\ntracing lines round the human shadow.[1820] The first stage of the\r\nart, they say, was this, the second stage being the employment of\r\nsingle colours; a process known as “monochromaton,”[1821] after it\r\nhad become more complicated, and which is still in use at the present\r\nday. The invention of line-drawing has been assigned to Philocles, the\r\nEgyptian, or to Cleanthes[1822] of Corinth. The first who practised\r\nthis line-drawing were Aridices, the Corinthian, and Telephanes, the\r\nSicyonian, artists who, without making use of any colours, shaded\r\nthe interior of the outline by drawing lines;[1823] hence, it was\r\nthe custom with them to add to the picture the name of the person\r\nrepresented. Ecphantus, the Corinthian, was the first to employ colours\r\nupon these pictures, made, it is said, of broken earthenware, reduced\r\nto powder. We shall show on a future[1824] occasion, that it was a\r\ndifferent artist of the same name, who, according to Cornelius Nepos,\r\ncame to Italy with Demaratus, the father of the Roman king, Tarquinius\r\nPriscus, on his flight from Corinth to escape the violence of the\r\ntyrant Cypselus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—THE ANTIQUITY OF PAINTING IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut already, in fact, had the art of painting been perfectly developed\r\nin Italy.[1825] At all events, there are extant in the temples at\r\nArdea, at this day, paintings of greater antiquity than Rome itself;\r\nin which, in my opinion, nothing is more marvellous, than that they\r\nshould have remained so long unprotected by a roof, and yet preserving\r\ntheir freshness.[1826] At Lanuvium, too, it is the same, where we\r\nsee an Atalanta and a Helena, without drapery, close together, and\r\npainted by the same artist. They are both of the greatest beauty, the\r\nformer being evidently the figure of a virgin, and they still remain\r\nuninjured, though the temple is in ruins. The Emperor Caius,[1827]\r\ninflamed with lustfulness, attempted to have them removed, but the\r\nnature of the plaster would not admit of it. There are in existence\r\nat Cære,[1828] some paintings of a still higher antiquity. Whoever\r\ncarefully examines them, will be forced to admit that no art has\r\narrived more speedily at perfection, seeing that it evidently was not\r\nin existence at the time of the Trojan War.[1829]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7. (4.)—ROMAN PAINTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, too, this art very soon rose into esteem, for it\r\nwas from it that the Fabii, a most illustrious family, derived their\r\nsurname of “Pictor;” indeed the first of the family who bore it,\r\nhimself painted the Temple of Salus,[1830] in the year of the City,\r\n450; a work which lasted to our own times, but was destroyed when the\r\ntemple was burnt, in the reign of Claudius. Next in celebrity were the\r\npaintings of the poet Pacuvius, in the Temple of Hercules, situate in\r\nthe Cattle Market:[1831] he was a son of the sister of Ennius, and the\r\nfame of the art was enhanced at Rome by the success of the artist on\r\nthe stage. After this period, the art was no longer practised by men of\r\nrank; unless, indeed, we would make reference to Turpilius, in our own\r\ntimes, a native of Venetia, and of equestrian rank, several of whose\r\nbeautiful works are still in existence at Verona. He painted, too,\r\nwith his left hand, a thing never known to have been done by any one\r\nbefore.[1832]\r\n\r\nTitidius Labeo, a person of prætorian rank, who had been formerly\r\nproconsul of the province of Gallia Narbonensis, and who lately died\r\nat a very advanced age, used to pride himself upon the little pictures\r\nwhich he executed, but it only caused him to be ridiculed and sneered\r\nat. I must not omit, too, to mention a celebrated consultation upon\r\nthe subject of painting, which was held by some persons of the highest\r\nrank. Q. Pedius,[1833] who had been honoured with the consulship and a\r\ntriumph, and who had been named by the Dictator Cæsar as co-heir with\r\nAugustus, had a grandson, who being dumb from his birth, the orator\r\nMessala, to whose family his grandmother belonged, recommended that he\r\nshould be brought up as a painter, a proposal which was also approved\r\nof by the late Emperor Augustus. He died, however, in his youth, after\r\nhaving made great progress in the art. But the high estimation in\r\nwhich painting came to be held at Rome, was principally due, in my\r\nopinion, to M. Valerius Maximus Messala, who, in the year of the City,\r\n490, was the first to exhibit a painting to the public; a picture,\r\nnamely, of the battle in which he had defeated the Carthaginians and\r\nHiero in Sicily, upon one side of the Curia Hostilia.[1834] The same\r\nthing was done, too, by L. Scipio,[1835] who placed in the Capitol a\r\npainting of the victory which he had gained in Asia; but his brother\r\nAfricanus, it is said, was offended at it, and not without reason, for\r\nhis son had been taken prisoner in the battle.[1836] Lucius Hostilius\r\nMancinus,[1837] too, who had been the first to enter Carthage at the\r\nfinal attack, gave a very similar offence to Æmilianus,[1838] by\r\nexposing in the Forum a painting of that city and the attack upon it,\r\nhe himself standing near the picture, and describing to the spectators\r\nthe various details of the siege; a piece of complaisance which secured\r\nhim the consulship at the ensuing Comitia.\r\n\r\nThe stage, too, which was erected for the games celebrated by Claudius\r\nPulcher,[1839] brought the art of painting into great admiration, it\r\nbeing observed that the ravens were so deceived by the resemblance, as\r\nto light upon the decorations which were painted in imitation of tiles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—AT WHAT PERIOD FOREIGN PAINTINGS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe high estimation in which the paintings of foreigners were held at\r\nRome commenced with Lucius Mummius, who, from his victories, acquired\r\nthe surname of “Achaicus.” For upon the sale of the spoil on that\r\noccasion, King Attalus having purchased, at the price of six thousand\r\ndenarii, a painting of Father Liber by Aristides,[1840] Mummius,\r\nfeeling surprised at the price, and suspecting that there might be\r\nsome merit in it of which he himself was unaware,[1841] in spite of\r\nthe complaints of Attalus, broke off the bargain, and had the picture\r\nplaced in the Temple of Ceres;[1842] the first instance, I conceive, of\r\na foreign painting being publicly exhibited at Rome.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I find, it became a common practice to exhibit foreign\r\npictures in the Forum; for it was to this circumstance that we are\r\nindebted for a joke of the orator Crassus. While pleading below the Old\r\nShops,[1843] he was interrupted by a witness who had been summoned,\r\nwith the question, “Tell me then, Crassus, what do you take me to be?”\r\n“Very much like him,” answered he, pointing to the figure of a Gaul in\r\na picture, thrusting out his tongue in a very unbecoming manner.[1844]\r\nIt was in the Forum, too, that was placed the picture of the Old\r\nShepherd leaning on his staff; respecting which, when the envoy of the\r\nTeutones was asked what he thought was the value of it, he made answer\r\nthat he would rather not have the original even, at a gift.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—AT WHAT PERIOD PAINTING WAS FIRST HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM AT ROME,\r\nAND FROM WHAT CAUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was the Dictator Cæsar that first brought the public exhibition\r\nof pictures into such high estimation, by consecrating an Ajax and\r\na Medea[1845] before the Temple of Venus Genetrix.[1846] After him\r\nthere was M. Agrippa, a man who was naturally more attached to rustic\r\nsimplicity than to refinement. Still, however, we have a magnificent\r\noration of his, and one well worthy of the greatest of our citizens,\r\non the advantage of exhibiting in public all pictures and statues; a\r\npractice which would have been far preferable to sending them into\r\nbanishment at our country-houses. Severe as he was in his tastes, he\r\npaid the people of Cyzicus twelve hundred thousand sesterces for two\r\npaintings, an Ajax and a Venus. He also ordered small paintings to be\r\nset in marble in the very hottest part of his Warm Baths;[1847] where\r\nthey remained until they were removed a short time since, when the\r\nbuilding was repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—WHAT PICTURES THE EMPERORS HAVE EXHIBITED IN PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Emperor Augustus did more than all the others; for he\r\nplaced in the most conspicuous part of his Forum, two pictures,\r\nrepresenting War and Triumph.[1848] He also placed in the Temple of\r\nhis father,[1849] Cæsar, a picture of the Castors,[1850] and one of\r\nVictory, in addition to those which we shall mention in our account\r\nof the works of the different artists.[1851] He also inserted two\r\npictures in the wall of the Curia[1852] which he consecrated in the\r\nComitium;[1853] one of which was a Nemea[1854] seated upon a lion,\r\nand bearing a palm in her hand. Close to her is an Old Man, standing\r\nwith a staff, and above his head hangs the picture of a chariot\r\nwith two horses. Nicias[1855] has written upon this picture that he\r\n“inburned”[1856] it, such being the word he has employed.\r\n\r\nIn the second picture the thing to be chiefly admired, is the\r\nresemblance that the youth bears to the old man his father, allowing,\r\nof course, for the difference in age; above them soars an eagle, which\r\ngrasps a dragon in its talons. Philochares[1857] attests that he is the\r\nauthor of this work, an instance, if we only consider it, of the mighty\r\npower wielded by the pictorial art; for here, thanks to Philochares,\r\nthe senate of the Roman people, age after age, has before its eyes\r\nGlaucion and his son Aristippus, persons who would otherwise have been\r\naltogether unknown. The Emperor Tiberius, too, a prince who was by no\r\nmeans very gracious, has exhibited in the temple dedicated by him,\r\nin his turn, to Augustus, several pictures which we shall describe\r\nhereafter.[1858]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11. (5.)—THE ART OF PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus much then with reference to the dignity of this now expiring art.\r\nWe have already[1859] stated with what single colours the earlier\r\nartists painted, when speaking of these pigments under the head of\r\nmetals. The new modes of painting which were afterwards discovered,\r\nand are known as “neogrammatea,”[1860] the names of the artists, their\r\ndifferent inventions, and the periods at which these inventions were\r\nadopted, will all be described when we come to enumerate the painters:\r\nfor the present, however, the proposed plan of this work requires,\r\nthat I should enlarge upon the nature of the several colours that are\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe art of painting at last became developed, in the invention of\r\nlight and shade, the alternating contrast of the colours serving to\r\nheighten the effect of each. At a later period, again, lustre[1861] was\r\nadded, a thing altogether different from light. The gradation between\r\nlustre and light on the one hand and shade on the other, was called\r\n“tonos;” while the blending of the various tints, and their passing\r\ninto one another, was known as “harmoge.”[1862]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12. (6.)—PIGMENTS OTHER THAN THOSE OF A METALLIC ORIGIN.\r\nARTIFICIAL COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nColours are either[1863] sombre or florid, these qualities arising\r\neither from the nature, of the substances or their mode of combination.\r\nThe florid colours are those which the employer supplies[1864] to\r\nthe painter at his own expense; minium,[1865] namely, armenium,\r\ncinnabaris,[1866] chrysocolla,[1867] indicum, and purpurissum. The\r\nothers are the sombre colours. Taking both kinds together, some\r\nare native colours, and others are artificial. Sinopis, rubrica,\r\nparætonium, melinum, eretria and orpiment, are native colours. The\r\nothers are artificial, more particularly those described by us when\r\nspeaking of metals; in addition to which there are, among the more\r\ncommon colours, ochra, usta or burnt ceruse, sandarach, sandyx,\r\nsyricum, and atramentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—SINOPIS: ELEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSinopis[1868] was discovered in Pontus; and hence its name, from the\r\ncity of Sinope there. It is produced also in Egypt, the Balearic\r\nislands, and Africa; but the best is found in Lemnos and Cappadocia,\r\nbeing extracted from quarries there. That part is considered the best\r\nwhich has been found adhering to the rock. In the native mass, it has\r\nits own proper colour within, but is spotted on the exterior; the\r\nancients made use of it for tone.[1869]\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of sinopis, the red, the pale red, and the\r\nintermediate. The price of the best is twelve denarii per pound; it\r\nis used both for painting with the brush, and for colouring wood. The\r\nkind which comes from Africa sells at eight asses per pound; the name\r\ngiven to it is “cicerculum.”[1870] That[1871] which is of the deepest\r\nred is the most in use for colouring compartitions. The sinopis known\r\nas the dull[1872] kind, being of a very tawny complexion, sells also\r\nat the price of eight asses per pound; it is used principally for the\r\nlower[1873] parts of compartitions.\r\n\r\nUsed medicinally, sinopis is of a soothing nature, and is employed as\r\nan ingredient in plasters and emollient poultices. It admits of being\r\neasily used, whether in the form of a dry or of a liquid composition,\r\nfor the cure of ulcers situate in the humid parts of the body, the\r\nmouth and the rectum, for instance. Used as an injection, it arrests\r\nlooseness of the bowels, and, taken in doses of one denarius, it acts\r\nas a check upon female discharges. Applied in a burnt state, with wine\r\nin particular, it has a desiccative effect upon granulations of the\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—RUBRICA; LEMNIAN EARTH: FOUR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome persons have wished to make out that sinopis is nothing else but\r\na kind of rubrica[1874] of second-rate quality, looking upon earth\r\nof Lemnos as a rubrics of the highest quality. This last approaches\r\nvery nearly to minium,[1875] and was as highly esteemed among the\r\nancients as the island that produces it: it was never sold except\r\nin sealed packages, a circumstance to which it was indebted for its\r\nadditional name of “sphragis.” It is with this material that they give\r\nthe under-coating to minium, in the adulteration of which it is also\r\nextensively employed.\r\n\r\nIn medicine it is very highly esteemed. Applied to the eyes in the form\r\nof a liniment, it allays defluxions and pains in those organs, and\r\narrests the discharges from lachrymal fistulas. To persons vomiting\r\nblood, it is administered with vinegar to drink. It is taken also\r\ninternally for affections of the spleen and kidneys; and by females for\r\nthe purpose of arresting flooding. It is employed too, to counteract\r\nthe effects of poisons, and of stings inflicted by sea or land\r\nserpents; hence it is that it is so commonly used as an ingredient in\r\nantidotes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15.—EGYPTIAN EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the other kinds of rubrica, those of Egypt and Africa are of the\r\ngreatest utility to workers in wood, from the fact of their being\r\nabsorbed with the greatest rapidity. They are used also for painting,\r\nand are found in a native state in iron-mines.[1876]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—OCHRA: REMEDIES DERIVED FROM RUBRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from rubrica also, that ochra[1877] is prepared, the rubrica\r\nbeing burnt[1878] in new earthen pots well luted with clay. The more\r\nhighly it is calcined in the furnace, the better the colour is. All\r\nkinds of rubrica are of a desiccative nature, and hence it is that they\r\nare so useful for plasters, and as an application even for erysipelas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—LEUCOPHORON.\r\n\r\n\r\nHalf a pound of Pontic sinopis, ten pounds of bright sil,[1879] and\r\ntwo pounds of Greek melinum,[1880] well mixed and triturated together\r\nfor twelve successive days, produce “leucophoron,”[1881] a cement used\r\nfor applying gold-leaf to wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—PARÆTONIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nParætonium[1882] is so called from the place[1883] of that name in\r\nEgypt. It is sea-foam,[1884] they say, solidified with slime, and\r\nhence it is that minute shells are often found in it. It is prepared\r\nalso in the Isle of Crete, and at Cyrenæ. At Rome, it is adulterated\r\nwith Cimolian[1885] earth, boiled and thickened. The price of that of\r\nthe highest quality is fifty denarii per six pounds. This is the most\r\nunctuous of all the white colours, and the most tenacious as a coating\r\nfor plaster, the result of its smoothness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—MELINUM: SIX REMEDIES. CERUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMelinum, too, is a white colour, the best being the produce of the Isle\r\nof Melos.[1886] It is found also in Samos; but this last kind is never\r\nused by painters, in consequence of its being too unctuous. The persons\r\nemployed in extracting it, lie at full length upon the ground, and\r\nsearch for the veins among the rocks. In medicine it is employed for\r\nmuch the same purposes as eretria;[1887] in addition to which, it dries\r\nthe tongue, acts as a depilatory, and has a soothing effect. The price\r\nof it is one sestertius per pound.\r\n\r\nThe third of the white pigments is ceruse, the nature of which we\r\nhave already[1888] explained when speaking of the ores of lead; there\r\nwas also a native ceruse, formerly found on the lands of Theodotus\r\nat Smyrna, which the ancients made use of for painting ships. At\r\nthe present day, all ceruse is prepared artificially, from lead and\r\nvinegar,[1889] as already stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—USTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsta[1890] was accidentally discovered at a fire in the Piræus,\r\nsome ceruse having been burnt in the jars there. Nicias, the artist\r\nabove-mentioned,[1891] was the first to use it. At the present day,\r\nthat of Asia, known also as “purpurea,” is considered the best. The\r\nprice of it is six denarii per pound. It is prepared also at Rome by\r\ncalcining marbled sil,[1892] and quenching it with vinegar. Without the\r\nuse of usta shadows cannot be made.[1893]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21.—ERETRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEretria takes its name from the territory[1894] which produces it.\r\nNicomachus[1895] and Parrhasius made use of it. In a medicinal point\r\nof view, it is cooling and emollient. In a calcined state, it promotes\r\nthe cicatrization of wounds, is very useful as a desiccative, and\r\nis particularly good for pains in the head, and for the detection\r\nof internal suppurations. If the earth, when applied[1896] with\r\nwater, does not dry with rapidity, the presence of purulent matter is\r\napprehended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—SANDARACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Juba, sandarach and ochra are both of them productions of\r\nthe island of Topazus,[1897] in the Red Sea; but neither of them are\r\nimported to us from that place. The mode of preparing sandarach we\r\nhave described[1898] already: there is a spurious kind also, prepared\r\nby calcining ceruse in the furnace. This substance, to be good, ought\r\nto be of a flame colour; the price of it is five asses per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—SANDYX.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalcined with an equal proportion of rubrica, sandarach forms\r\nsandyx;[1899] although I perceive that Virgil, in the following\r\nline,[1900] has taken sandyx to be a plant—\r\n\r\n  “Sandyx itself shall clothe the feeding lambs.”\r\n\r\nThe price of sandyx[1901] is one half that of sandarach; these two\r\ncolours being the heaviest of all in weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—SYRICUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the artificial colours, too, is syricum, which is used as an\r\nunder-coating for minium, as already[1902] stated. It is prepared from\r\na combination of sinopis with sandyx.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25.—ATRAMENTUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtramentum,[1903] too, must be reckoned among the artificial colours,\r\nalthough it is also derived in two ways from the earth. For sometimes\r\nit is found exuding from the earth like the brine of salt-pits, while\r\nat other times an earth itself of a sulphurous colour is sought for\r\nthe purpose. Painters, too, have been known to go so far as to dig up\r\nhalf-charred bones[1904] from the sepulchres for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAll these plans, however, are new-fangled and troublesome; for this\r\nsubstance may be prepared, in numerous ways, from the soot that is\r\nyielded by the combustion of resin or pitch; so much so, indeed,\r\nthat manufactories have been built on the principle of not allowing\r\nan escape for the smoke evolved by the process. The most esteemed\r\nblack,[1905] however, that is made in this way, is prepared from the\r\nwood of the torch-pine.\r\n\r\nIt is adulterated by mixing it with the ordinary soot from furnaces and\r\nbaths, a substance which is also employed for the purpose of writing.\r\nOthers, again, calcine dried wine-lees, and assure us that if the wine\r\nwas originally of good quality from which the colour is made, it will\r\nbear comparison with that of indicum.[1906] Polygnotus and Micon, the\r\nmost celebrated painters of Athens, made their black from grape-husks,\r\nand called it “tryginon.”[1907] Apelles invented a method of preparing\r\nit from burnt ivory, the name given to it being “elephantinon.”\r\n\r\nWe have indicum also, a substance imported from India, the composition\r\nof which is at present unknown to me.[1908] Dyers, too, prepare an\r\natramentum from the black inflorescence which adheres to the brazen\r\ndye-pans. It is made also from logs of torch-pine, burnt to charcoal\r\nand pounded in a mortar. The sæpia, too, has a wonderful property of\r\nsecreting a black liquid;[1909] but from this liquid no colour is\r\nprepared. The preparation of every kind of atramentum is completed by\r\nexposure to the sun; the black, for writing, having an admixture of\r\ngum, and that for coating walls, an admixture of glue. Black pigment\r\nthat has been dissolved in vinegar is not easily effaced by washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—PURPURISSUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the remaining colours which, as already stated,[1910] owing to\r\ntheir dearness are furnished by the employer, purpurissum holds the\r\nhighest rank. For the purpose of preparing it, argentaria or silver\r\nchalk[1911] is dyed along with purple[1912] cloth, it imbibing the\r\ncolour more speedily than the wool. The best of all is that which,\r\nbeing thrown the very first into the boiling cauldron, becomes\r\nsaturated with the dye in its primitive state. The next best in quality\r\nis that which has been put into the same liquor, after the first\r\nhas been removed. Each time that this is done, the quality becomes\r\nproportionally deteriorated, owing, of course, to the comparative\r\nthinness of the liquid. The reason that the purpurissum of Puteoli is\r\nmore highly esteemed than that of Tyre, Gætulia, or Laconia, places\r\nwhich produce the most precious kinds of purple, is the fact that it\r\ncombines more readily with hysginum,[1913] and that it is made to\r\nabsorb the colouring liquid of madder. The worst purpurissum is that of\r\nLanuvium.[1914]\r\n\r\nThe price of purpurissum is from one to thirty denarii per pound.\r\nPersons who use it in painting, place a coat of sandyx beneath; a layer\r\non which of purpurissum with glair of egg, produces all the brilliant\r\ntints of minium. If, on the other hand, it is their object to make a\r\npurple, they lay a coat of cæruleum[1915] beneath, and purpurissum,\r\nwith egg,[1916] upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—INDICUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in esteem to this is indicum,[1917] a production of India, being\r\na slime[1918] which adheres to the scum upon the reeds there. When\r\npowdered, it is black in appearance, but when diluted in water it\r\nyields a marvellous combination of purple and cæruleum. There is\r\nanother[1919] kind, also, which floats upon the surface of the pans in\r\nthe purple dye-houses, being the scum which rises upon the purple dye.\r\nPersons who adulterate it, stain pigeons’ dung with genuine indicum, or\r\nelse colour Selinusian[1920] earth, or anularian[1921] chalk with woad.\r\n\r\nThe proper way of testing indicum is by laying it on hot coals, that\r\nwhich is genuine producing a fine purple flame, and emitting a smell\r\nlike that of sea-water while it smokes: hence it is that some are of\r\nopinion that it is gathered from the rocks on the sea-shore. The price\r\nof indicum is twenty denarii per pound. Used medicinally, it alleviates\r\ncold shiverings and defluxions, and acts as a desiccative upon sores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—ARMENIUM; ONE REMEDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nArmenia sends us the colouring substance which is known to us by its\r\nname.[1922] This also is a mineral, which admits of being dyed, like\r\nchrysocolla,[1923] and is best when it most closely resembles that\r\nsubstance, the colour being pretty much that of cæruleum. In former\r\ntimes it was sold at thirty sesterces per pound; but there has been\r\nfound of late in the Spanish provinces a sand which admits of a similar\r\npreparation, and consequently armenium has come to be sold so low as\r\nat six denarii per pound. It differs from cæruleum in a certain degree\r\nof whiteness, which causes the colour it yields to be thinner in\r\ncomparison. The only use made of it in medicine is for the purpose of\r\ngiving nourishment to the hair, that of the eyelids in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—APPIANUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are also two colours of very inferior quality, which have\r\nbeen recently discovered. One of these is the green known as\r\n“appianum,”[1924] a fair imitation of chrysocolla; just as though, we\r\nhad not had to mention sufficient of these counterfeits already. This\r\ncolour, too, is prepared from a green chalk, the usual price of it\r\nbeing one sesterce per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—ANULARIAN WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other colour is that known as “anularian[1925] white;” being used\r\nfor giving a brilliant whiteness to the figures of females.[1926] This,\r\ntoo, is prepared from a kind of chalk, combined with the glassy paste\r\nwhich the lower classes wear in their rings:[1927] hence it is, that it\r\nhas the name “anulare.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31. (7.)—WHICH COLOURS DO NOT ADMIT OF BEING LAID ON A WET\r\nCOATING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose among the colours which require a dry, cretaceous, coating,[1928]\r\nand refuse to adhere to a wet surface, are purpurissum, indicum,\r\ncæruleum,[1929] melinum, orpiment, appianum, and ceruse. Wax,\r\ntoo, is stained with all these colouring substances for encaustic\r\npainting;[1930] a process which does not admit of being applied to\r\nwalls, but is in common use[1931] by way of ornament for ships of\r\nwar, and, indeed, merchant-ships at the present day. As we go so far\r\nas to paint these vehicles of danger, no one can be surprised if we\r\npaint our funeral piles as well, or if we have our gladiators conveyed\r\nin handsome carriages to the scene of death, or, at all events, of\r\ncarnage. When we only contemplate this extensive variety of colours, we\r\ncannot but admire the ingenuity displayed by the men of former days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—WHAT COLOURS WERE USED BY THE ANCIENTS IN PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with four colours only,[1932] that Apelles,[1933] Echion,\r\nMelanthius, and Nicomachus, those most illustrous painters, executed\r\ntheir immortal works; melinum[1934] for the white, Attic sil[1935]\r\nfor the yellow, Pontic sinopis for the red, and atramentum for the\r\nblack;[1936] and yet a single picture of theirs has sold before now\r\nfor the treasures of whole cities. But at the present day, when purple\r\nis employed for colouring walls even, and when India sends to us the\r\nslime[1937] of her rivers, and the corrupt blood of her dragons[1938]\r\nand her elephants, there is no such thing as a picture of high quality\r\nproduced. Everything, in fact, was superior at a time when the\r\nresources of art were so much fewer than they now are. Yes, so it is;\r\nand the reason is, as we have already stated,[1939] that it is the\r\nmaterial, and not the efforts of genius, that is now the object of\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—AT WHAT TIME COMBATS OF GLADIATORS WERE FIRST PAINTED AND\r\nPUBLICLY EXHIBITED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne folly, too, of this age of ours, in reference to painting, I must\r\nnot omit. The Emperor Nero ordered a painting of himself to be executed\r\nupon canvass, of colossal proportions, one hundred and twenty feet\r\nin height; a thing till then unknown.[1940] This picture was just\r\ncompleted when it was burnt by lightning, with the greater part of the\r\ngardens of Maius, in which it was exhibited.\r\n\r\nA freedman of the same prince, on the occasion of his exhibiting a show\r\nof gladiators at Antium, had the public porticos hung, as everybody\r\nknows, with paintings, in which were represented genuine portraits of\r\nthe gladiators and all the other assistants. Indeed, at this place,\r\nthere has been a very prevailing taste for paintings for many ages\r\npast. C. Terentius Lucanus was the first who had combats of gladiators\r\npainted for public exhibition: in honour of his grandfather, who had\r\nadopted him, he provided thirty pairs of gladiators in the Forum, for\r\nthree consecutive days, and exhibited a painting of their combats in\r\nthe Grove of Diana.[1941]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34. (8.)—THE AGE OF PAINTING; WITH THE NAMES OF THE MORE\r\nCELEBRATED WORKS AND ARTISTS, FOUR HUNDRED AND FIVE IN NUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to enumerate, as briefly as possible, the\r\nmore eminent among the painters; it not being consistent with the\r\nplan of this work to go into any great lengths of detail. It must\r\nsuffice therefore, in some cases, to name the artist in a cursory\r\nmanner only, and with reference to the account given of others; with\r\nthe exception, of course, of the more famous productions of the\r\npictorial art, whether still in existence or now lost, all of which\r\nit will be only right to take some notice of. In this department,\r\nthe ordinary exactness of the Greeks has been somewhat inconsistent,\r\nin placing the painters so many Olympiads after the statuaries and\r\ntoreutic[1942] artists, and the very first of them so late as the\r\nninetieth Olympiad; seeing that Phidias himself is said to have been\r\noriginally a painter, and that there was a shield at Athens which had\r\nbeen painted by him; in addition to which, it is universally agreed\r\nthat in the eighty-third Olympiad, his brother Panænus[1943] painted,\r\nat Elis,[1944] the interior of the shield of Minerva, which had been\r\nexecuted by Colotes,[1945] a disciple of Phidias and his assistant in\r\nthe statue of the Olympian Jupiter.[1946] And then besides, is it not\r\nequally admitted that Candaules, the last Lydian king of the race of\r\nthe Heraclidæ, very generally known also by the name of Myrsilus, paid\r\nits weight in gold for a picture by the painter Bularchus,[1947] which\r\nrepresented the battle fought by him with the Magnetes? so great was\r\nthe estimation in which the art was already held. This circumstance\r\nmust of necessity have happened about the period of our Romulus; for\r\nit was in the eighteenth Olympiad that Candaules perished, or, as some\r\nwriters say, in the same year as the death of Romulus: a thing which\r\nclearly demonstrates that even at that early period the art had already\r\nbecome famous, and had arrived at a state of great perfection.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we are bound to admit this conclusion, it must be equally\r\nevident that the commencement of the art is of much earlier date, and\r\nthat those artists who painted in monochrome,[1948] and whose dates\r\nhave not been handed down to us, must have flourished at even an\r\nanterior period; Hygiænon, namely, Dinias, Charmadas,[1949] Eumarus, of\r\nAthens, the first who distinguished the sexes[1950] in painting, and\r\nattempted to imitate every kind of figure; and Cimon[1951] of Cleonæ,\r\nwho improved upon the inventions of Eumarus.\r\n\r\nIt was this Cimon, too, who first invented foreshortenings,[1952] or in\r\nother words, oblique views of the figure, and who first learned to vary\r\nthe features by representing them in the various attitudes of looking\r\nbackwards, upwards, or downwards. It was he, too, who first marked the\r\narticulations of the limbs, indicated the veins, and gave the natural\r\nfolds and sinuosities to drapery. Panænus, too, the brother of Phidias,\r\neven executed a painting[1953] of the battle fought by the Athenians\r\nwith the Persians at Marathon: so common, indeed, had the employment of\r\ncolours become, and to such a state of perfection had the art arrived,\r\nthat he was able to represent, it is said, the portraits of the\r\nvarious generals who commanded at that battle, Miltiades, Callimachus,\r\nand Cynægirus, on the side of the Athenians, and, on that of the\r\nbarbarians, Datis and Artaphernes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35. (9.)—THE FIRST CONTEST FOR EXCELLENCE IN THE PICTORIAL ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd not only this, but, during the time that Panænus flourished,\r\nthere were contests in the pictorial art instituted at Corinth and\r\nDelphi. On the first occasion, Panænus himself entered the lists,\r\nat the Pythian Games, with Timagoras of Chalcis, by whom he was\r\ndefeated; a circumstance which is recorded in some ancient lines by\r\nTimagoras himself, and an undoubted proof that the chroniclers are in\r\nerror as to the date of the origin of painting. After these, and yet\r\nbefore the ninetieth Olympiad, there were other celebrated painters,\r\nPolygnotus of Thasos,[1954] for instance, who was the first to paint\r\nfemales in transparent drapery, and to represent the head covered with\r\na parti-coloured head-dress. He, too, was the first to contribute\r\nmany other improvements to the art of painting, opening the mouth,\r\nfor example, showing the teeth, and throwing expression into the\r\ncountenance, in place of the ancient rigidity of the features.\r\n\r\nThere is a picture by this artist in the Portico[1955] of Pompeius,\r\nbefore the Curia that was built by him; with reference to which, there\r\nis some doubt whether the man represented with a shield is in the act\r\nof ascending or descending. He also embellished the Temple[1956] at\r\nDelphi, and at Athens the Portico known as the Pœcile;[1957] at which\r\nlast he worked gratuitously, in conjunction with Micon,[1958] who\r\nreceived pay for his labours. Indeed Polygnotus was held in the higher\r\nesteem of the two; for the Amphictyons,[1959] who form the general\r\nCouncil of Greece, decreed that he should have his lodging furnished\r\nhim at the public expense.\r\n\r\nThere was also another Micon, distinguished from the first Micon by\r\nthe surname of “the younger,” and whose daughter Timarete[1960] also\r\npractised the art of painting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—ARTISTS WHO PAINTED WITH THE PENCIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ninetieth Olympiad lived Aglaophon,[1961] Cephisodorus, Erillus,\r\nand Evenor, the father of Parrhasius, one of the greatest of painters,\r\nand of whom we shall have to speak when we come to the period at which\r\nhe flourished. All these were artists of note, but not sufficiently\r\nso to detain us by any further details, in our haste to arrive at the\r\nluminaries of the art; first among whom shone Apollodorus of Athens,\r\nin the ninety-third Olympiad. He was the first to paint objects as\r\nthey really appeared; the first too, we may justly say, to confer\r\nglory[1962] by the aid of the pencil.[1963] Of this artist there is a\r\nPriest in Adoration, and an Ajax struck by Lightning, a work to be seen\r\nat Pergamus at the present day: before him, there is no painting of any\r\nartist now to be seen which has the power of rivetting the eye.\r\n\r\nThe gates of art being now thrown open by Apollodorus, Zeuxis of\r\nHeraclea[1964] entered upon the scene, in the fourth year of the\r\nninety-fifth Olympiad, destined to lead the pencil—for it is of the\r\npencil that we are still speaking—a pencil for which there was nothing\r\ntoo arduous, to a very high pitch of glory. By some writers he is\r\nerroneously placed in the eighty-ninth Olympiad, a date that must of\r\nnecessity be reserved for Demophilus of Himera and Neseus of Thasos,\r\nof one of whom, it is uncertain which, Zeuxis was the pupil. It was in\r\nreference to him that Apollodorus, above-mentioned, wrote a verse to\r\nthe effect, that Zeuxis had stolen the art from others and had taken\r\nit all to himself.[1965] Zeuxis also acquired such a vast amount of\r\nwealth, that, in a spirit of ostentation, he went so far as to parade\r\nhimself at Olympia with his name embroidered on the checked pattern of\r\nhis garments in letters of gold. At a later period, he came to the\r\ndetermination to give away his works, there being no price high enough\r\nto pay for them, he said. Thus, for instance, he gave an Alcmena to the\r\npeople of Agrigentum, and a Pan to Archelaüs.[1966] He also painted a\r\nPenelope, in which the peculiar character of that matron appears to be\r\ndelineated to the very life; and a figure of an athlete, with which\r\nhe was so highly pleased, that he wrote beneath it the line which has\r\nsince become so famous, to the effect that it would be easier to find\r\nfault with him than to imitate him.[1967] His Jupiter seated on the\r\nthrone, with the other Deities standing around him, is a magnificent\r\nproduction: the same, too, with his Infant Hercules strangling the\r\nDragons, in presence of Amphitryon and his mother Alcmena, who is\r\nstruck with horror. Still, however, Zeuxis is generally censured for\r\nmaking the heads and articulations of his figures out of proportion.\r\nAnd yet, so scrupulously careful was he, that on one occasion, when he\r\nwas about to execute a painting for the people of Agrigentum,[1968] to\r\nbe consecrated in the Temple of the Lacinian Juno there, he had the\r\nyoung maidens of the place stripped for examination, and selected five\r\nof them, in order to adopt in his picture the most commendable points\r\nin the form of each. He also painted some monochromes in white.[1969]\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries and rivals of Zeuxis were Timanthes, Androcydes,\r\nEupompus, and Parrhasius. (10.) This last, it is said, entered into a\r\npictorial contest with Zeuxis, who represented some grapes, painted so\r\nnaturally that the birds flew towards the spot where the picture was\r\nexhibited. Parrhasius, on the other hand, exhibited a curtain, drawn\r\nwith such singular truthfulness, that Zeuxis, elated with the judgment\r\nwhich had been passed upon his work by the birds, haughtily demanded\r\nthat the curtain should be drawn aside to let the picture be seen.\r\nUpon finding his mistake, with a great degree of ingenuous candour he\r\nadmitted that he had been surpassed, for that whereas he himself had\r\nonly deceived the birds, Parrhasius had deceived him, an artist.\r\n\r\nThere is a story, too, that at a later period, Zeuxis having painted\r\na child carrying grapes, the birds came to peck at them; upon which,\r\nwith a similar degree of candour, he expressed himself vexed with his\r\nwork, and exclaimed—“I have surely painted the grapes better than the\r\nchild, for if I had fully succeeded in the last, the birds would have\r\nbeen in fear of it.” Zeuxis executed some figures also in clay,[1970]\r\nthe only works of art that were left behind at Ambracia, when Fulvius\r\nNobilior[1971] transported the Muses from that city to Rome. There is\r\nat Rome a Helena by Zeuxis, in the Porticos of Philippus,[1972] and a\r\nMarsyas Bound, in the Temple of Concord[1973] there.\r\n\r\nParrhasius of Ephesus also contributed greatly to the progress of\r\npainting, being the first to give symmetry to his figures, the first\r\nto give play and expression to the features, elegance to the hair,\r\nand gracefulness to the mouth: indeed, for contour, it is universally\r\nadmitted by artists that he bore away the palm. This, in painting, is\r\nthe very highest point of skill. To paint substantial bodies and the\r\ninterior of objects is a great thing, no doubt, but at the same time\r\nit is a point in which many have excelled: but to make the extreme\r\noutline of the figure, to give the finishing touches to the painting\r\nin rounding off the contour, this is a point of success in the art\r\nwhich is but rarely attained. For the extreme outline, to be properly\r\nexecuted, requires to be nicely rounded, and so to terminate as to\r\nprove the existence of something more behind it, and thereby disclose\r\nthat which it also serves to hide.\r\n\r\nSuch is the merit conceded to Parrhasius by Antigonus[1974] and\r\nXenocrates,[1975] who have written on the art of painting; and in this\r\nas well as in other points, not only do they admit his excellence,\r\nbut enlarge upon it in terms of the highest commendation. There are\r\nmany pen sketches by him still in existence, both upon panel and on\r\nparchment, from the study of which, even artists, it is said, may\r\ngreatly profit.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these points of excellence, however, Parrhasius seems\r\ncomparatively inferior to himself in giving the proper expression to\r\nthe middle of the body. In his allegorical picture of the People of\r\nAthens, he has displayed singular ingenuity in the treatment of his\r\nsubject; for in representing it, he had to depict it as at once fickle,\r\ncholeric, unjust, and versatile; while, again, he had equally to show\r\nits attributes of implacability[1976] and clemency, compassionateness\r\nand pride, loftiness and humility, fierceness and timidity—and all\r\nthese at once. He painted a Theseus also, which was formerly in the\r\nCapitol at Rome, a Naval Commander[1977] wearing a cuirass, and, in one\r\npicture, now at Rhodes, figures of Meleager, Hercules, and Perseus.\r\nThis last painting, though it has been thrice struck by lightning,\r\nhas escaped being effaced, a circumstance which tends to augment the\r\nadmiration which it naturally excites. He painted an Archigallus[1978]\r\nalso, a picture which the Emperor Tiberius greatly admired. According\r\nto Deculo,[1979] that prince had it shut up in his chamber, the price\r\nat which it was valued being six hundred thousand sesterces.\r\n\r\nParrhasius also painted a Thracian Nurse, with an Infant in her arms, a\r\nPhiliscus,[1980] a Father Liber[1981] attended by Virtue, Two Children,\r\nin which we see pourtrayed the careless simplicity of childhood, and\r\na Priest attended by a Boy, with a censer and chaplet. There are also\r\ntwo most noble pictures by him; one of which represents a Runner[1982]\r\ncontending for the prize, completely armed, so naturally depicted that\r\nhe has all the appearance of sweating. In the other we see the Runner\r\ntaking off his armour, and can fancy that we hear him panting aloud\r\nfor breath. His Æneas, Castor, and Pollux, all represented in the same\r\npicture, are highly praised; his Telephus also, and his Achilles,\r\nAgamemnon, and Ulysses.\r\n\r\nParrhasius was a most prolific artist, but at the same time there\r\nwas no one who enjoyed the glory conferred upon him by his talent\r\nwith greater insolence and arrogance. It was in this spirit, that\r\nhe went so far as to assume certain surnames, and to call himself\r\n“Habrodiætus;”[1983] while in some other verses he declared himself\r\nto be the “prince of painters,” and asserted that in him the art had\r\narrived at perfection. But above all things, it was a boast with him\r\nthat he had sprung from the lineage of Apollo, and that he had painted\r\nhis Hercules, a picture now at Lindos, just as he had often seen him\r\nin his sleep. It was in this spirit, too, that upon being defeated by\r\nTimanthes, at Samos, by a great majority of votes, the subject of the\r\npicture being Ajax and the Award of the Arms,[1984] he declared, in the\r\nname of his hero, that he felt himself quite disgraced on thus seeing\r\nhimself a second time defeated by an unworthy opponent. He painted also\r\nsome smaller pictures of an immodest nature, indulging his leisure in\r\nsuch prurient fancies as these.[1985]\r\n\r\nAs to Timanthes,[1986] he was an artist highly gifted with genius,\r\nand loud have some of the orators[1987] been in their commendations\r\nof his Iphigenia, represented as she stands at the altar awaiting her\r\ndoom. Upon the countenance of all present, that of her uncle[1988] in\r\nparticular, grief was depicted; but having already exhausted all the\r\ncharacteristic features of sorrow, the artist adopted the device of\r\nveiling the features of the victim’s father,[1989] finding himself\r\nunable adequately to give expression to his feelings. There are also\r\nsome other proofs of his genius, a Sleeping Cyclops, for instance,\r\nwhich he has painted upon a small panel; but, being desirous to convey\r\nan idea of his gigantic stature, he has painted some Satyrs near him\r\nmeasuring his thumb with a thyrsus. Indeed, Timanthes is the only one\r\namong the artists in whose works there is always something more implied\r\nby the pencil than is expressed, and whose execution, though of the\r\nvery highest quality, is always surpassed by the inventiveness of his\r\ngenius. He has also painted the figure of a Hero, a master-piece of\r\nskill, in which he has carried the art to the very highest pitch of\r\nperfection, in the delineation of the warrior: this last-mentioned\r\nwork is now at Rome, in the Temple of Pence.[1990]\r\n\r\nIt was at this period, too, that Euxinidas had for his pupil\r\nAristides,[1991] who became a most illustrious artist; and that\r\nEupompus instructed Pamphilus, who afterwards became the instructor of\r\nApelles. There is by Eupompus, a Victor in a gymnastic contest, holding\r\na palm. So high was the reputation of this artist, that he established\r\na school of painting, and so divided the art into three styles;\r\nwhereas till then there had been but two, known respectively as the\r\nHelladic[1992] and the Asiatic. In honour of him, a native of Sicyon by\r\nbirth, the Helladic school was divided into two, and from this period\r\nthere were three distinct styles recognized, the Ionic, the Sicyonian,\r\nand the Attic.\r\n\r\nWe have, by Pamphilus,[1993] a picture representing the Alliance and\r\nthe Battle that was fought at Phlius;[1994] the Victory[1995] also\r\nthat was gained by the Athenians, and a representation of Ulysses in\r\nhis ship. He was a Macedonian by birth, but was the first painter who\r\nwas also skilled in all the other sciences, arithmetic and geometry\r\nmore particularly, without the aid of which he maintained that the\r\npictorial art could not attain perfection. He gave instruction to no\r\none for a smaller sum than one talent, at the rate of five hundred\r\ndenarii per annum,[1996] and this fee both Apelles and Melanthius\r\npaid. It was through his influence that, first at Sicyon, and then\r\nthroughout the whole of Greece, all children of free birth were taught\r\nthe graphic[1997] art, or in other words, the art of depicting upon\r\nboxwood, before all others; in consequence of which this came to be\r\nlooked upon as the first step in the liberal arts. It is the fact,\r\nhowever, that this art has always been held in high estimation, and\r\ncultivated by persons of free birth, and that, at a more recent period,\r\nmen of rank even began to pursue it; it having always been forbidden\r\nthat slaves should receive instruction in it. Hence it is, that neither\r\nin painting nor in the toreutic[1998] art has there been any celebrated\r\nwork executed by a slave.\r\n\r\nIn the hundred and seventh Olympiad, flourished Aëtion and\r\nTherimachus.[1999] By the former we have some fine pictures; a Father\r\nLiber,[2000] Tragedy and Comedy, Semiramis from the rank of a slave\r\nelevated to the throne, an Old Woman bearing torches, and a New-made\r\nBride, remarkable for the air of modesty with which she is pourtrayed.\r\n\r\nBut it was Apelles[2001] of Cos, in the hundred and twelfth Olympiad,\r\nwho surpassed all the other painters who either preceded or succeeded\r\nhim. Single-handed, he contributed more to painting than all the others\r\ntogether, and even went so far as to publish some treatises on the\r\nprinciples of the art. The great point of artistic merit with him was\r\nhis singular charm of gracefulness,[2002] and this too, though the\r\ngreatest of painters were his contemporaries. In admiring their works\r\nand bestowing high eulogiums upon them, he used to say that there\r\nwas still wanting in them that ideal of beauty[2003] so peculiar to\r\nhimself, and known to the Greeks as “Charis;”[2004] others, he said,\r\nhad acquired all the other requisites of perfection, but in this one\r\npoint he himself had no equal. He also asserted his claim to another\r\ngreat point of merit: admiring a picture by Protogenes, which bore\r\nevident marks of unbounded laboriousness and the most minute finish,\r\nhe remarked that in every respect Protogenes was fully his equal, or\r\nperhaps his superior, except in this, that he himself knew when to\r\ntake his hand off a picture—a memorable lesson, which teaches us that\r\novercarefulness may be productive of bad results. His candour too, was\r\nequal to his talent; he acknowledged the superiority of Melanthius in\r\nhis grouping, and of Asclepiodorus in the niceness of his measurements,\r\nor, in other words, the distances that ought to be left between the\r\nobjects represented.\r\n\r\nA circumstance that happened to him in connection with Protogenes\r\nis worthy of notice. The latter was living at Rhodes, when Apelles\r\ndisembarked there, desirous of seeing the works of a man whom he had\r\nhitherto only known by reputation. Accordingly, he repaired at once\r\nto the studio; Protogenes was not at home, but there happened to be a\r\nlarge panel upon the easel ready for painting, with an old woman who\r\nwas left in charge. To his enquiries she made answer, that Protogenes\r\nwas not at home, and then asked whom she should name as the visitor.\r\n“Here he is,” was the reply of Apelles, and seizing a brush, he traced\r\nwith colour upon the panel an outline of a singularly minute fineness.\r\nUpon his return, the old woman mentioned to Protogenes what had\r\nhappened. The artist, it is said, upon remarking the delicacy of the\r\ntouch, instantly exclaimed that Apelles must have been the visitor, for\r\nthat no other person was capable of executing anything so exquisitely\r\nperfect. So saying, he traced within the same outline a still finer\r\noutline, but with another colour, and then took his departure, with\r\ninstructions to the woman to show it to the stranger, if he returned,\r\nand to let him know that this was the person whom he had come to see.\r\nIt happened as he anticipated; Apelles returned, and vexed at finding\r\nhimself thus surpassed, he took up another colour and split[2005]\r\nboth of the outlines, leaving no possibility of anything finer being\r\nexecuted. Upon seeing this, Protogenes admitted that he was defeated,\r\nand at once flew to the harbour to look for his guest. He thought\r\nproper, too, to transmit the panel to posterity, just as it was, and it\r\nalways continued to be held in the highest admiration by all, artists\r\nin particular. I am told that it was burnt in the first fire which\r\ntook place at Cæsar’s palace on the Palatine Hill; but in former times\r\nI have often stopped to admire it. Upon its vast surface it contained\r\nnothing whatever except the three outlines, so remarkably fine as to\r\nescape the sight: among the most elaborate works of numerous other\r\nartists it had all the appearance of a blank space; and yet by that\r\nvery fact it attracted the notice of every one, and was held in higher\r\nestimation than any other painting there.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom with Apelles, to which he most tenaciously adhered,\r\nnever to let any day pass, however busy he might be, without exercising\r\nhimself by tracing some outline or other; a practice which has now\r\npassed into a proverb.[2006] It was also a practice with him, when\r\nhe had completed a work, to exhibit it to the view of the passers-by\r\nin some exposed place;[2007] while he himself, concealed behind the\r\npicture, would listen to the criticisms that were passed upon it; it\r\nbeing his opinion that the judgment of the public was preferable to\r\nhis own, as being the more discerning of the two. It was under these\r\ncircumstances, they say, that he was censured by a shoemaker for having\r\nrepresented the shoes with one shoe-string too little. The next day,\r\nthe shoemaker, quite proud at seeing the former error corrected, thanks\r\nto his advice, began to criticize the leg; upon which Apelles, full of\r\nindignation, popped his head out, and reminded him that a shoemaker\r\nshould give no opinion beyond the shoes, a piece of advice which has\r\nequally passed into a proverbial saying.[2008] In fact, Apelles was\r\na person of great amenity of manners, a circumstance which rendered\r\nhim particularly agreeable to Alexander the Great, who would often\r\ncome to his studio. He had forbidden himself, by public edict, as\r\nalready stated,[2009] to be represented by any other artist. On one\r\noccasion, however, when the prince was in his studio, talking a great\r\ndeal about painting without knowing anything about it, Apelles quietly\r\nbegged that he would quit the subject, telling him that he would\r\nget laughed at by the boys who were there grinding the colours: so\r\ngreat was the influence which he rightfully possessed over a monarch,\r\nwho was otherwise of an irascible temperament. And yet, irascible as\r\nhe was, Alexander conferred upon him a very signal mark of the high\r\nestimation in which he held him; for having, in his admiration of her\r\nextraordinary beauty, engaged Apelles to paint Pancaste undraped,[2010]\r\nthe most beloved of all his concubines, the artist while so engaged,\r\nfell in love with her; upon which, Alexander, perceiving this to be\r\nthe case, made him a present of her, thus showing himself, though a\r\ngreat king in courage, a still greater one in self-command, this action\r\nredounding no less to his honour than any of his victories. For in thus\r\nconquering himself, not only did he sacrifice his passions in favour\r\nof the artist, but even his affections as well; uninfluenced, too, by\r\nthe feelings which must have possessed his favourite in thus passing at\r\nonce from the arms of a monarch to those of a painter. Some persons are\r\nof opinion that Pancaste was the model of Apelles in his painting of\r\nVenus Anadyomene.[2011]\r\n\r\nIt was Apelles too, who, courteous even to his rivals, first\r\nestablished the reputation of Protogenes at Rhodes. Held as he was\r\nin little estimation by his own fellow-countrymen, a thing that\r\ngenerally[2012] is the case, Apelles enquired of him what price he\r\nset upon certain finished works of his, which he had on hand. Upon\r\nProtogenes mentioning some very trifling sum or other, Apelles made\r\nhim an offer of fifty talents, and then circulated a report that he\r\nwas buying these works in order to sell them as his own. By this\r\ncontrivance, he aroused the Rhodians to a better appreciation of the\r\nmerits of their artist, and only consented to leave the pictures with\r\nthem upon their offering a still larger price.\r\n\r\nHe painted portraits, too, so exactly to the life, that a fact with\r\nwhich we are made acquainted by the writings of Apion the grammarian\r\nseems altogether incredible. One of those persons, he says, who\r\ndivine events by the traits of the features, and are known as\r\n“metoposcopi,”[2013] was enabled, by an examination of his portraits,\r\nto tell the year of their death, whether past or future, of each person\r\nrepresented. Apelles had been on bad terms with Ptolemæus in former\r\ntimes, when they formed part of the suite of Alexander. After Ptolemæus\r\nhad become king of Egypt, it so happened that Apelles was driven by\r\nthe violence of a tempest to Alexandria. Upon this, some of his rivals\r\nfraudulently suborned a jester, who was attached to the court, to carry\r\nhim an invitation to dine with the king. Accordingly, Apelles attended;\r\nupon which Ptolemæus was highly indignant, and, summoning before him\r\nhis stewards[2014] of the household, requested that the artist would\r\npoint out the one that had given him the invitation. Thus challenged,\r\nApelles seized a piece of quenched charcoal that lay in the fire-place,\r\nand traced a likeness upon the wall, with such exactness, that the\r\nking, the moment he began it, recognized the features as those of the\r\njester. He also painted a portrait of King Antigonus;[2015] and as\r\nthat monarch was blind of one eye, he invented a method of concealing\r\nthe defect. With this object, he painted him in profile, in order that\r\nwhat in reality was wanting to the person might have the semblance of\r\nbeing wanting to the picture rather, he making it his care to show that\r\nside of the face only which he could show without any defect. Among his\r\nworks, too, there are some figures representing persons at the point of\r\ndeath; but it is not easy to say which of his productions are of the\r\nhighest order of excellence.\r\n\r\nHis Venus Rising from the Sea, known as the Venus Anadyomene,[2016] was\r\nconsecrated by the late Emperor Augustus in the Temple[2017] of his\r\nfather[2018] Cæsar; a work which has been celebrated in certain Greek\r\nlines,[2019] which, though they have outlived it, have perpetuated its\r\nfame.[2020] The lower part of the picture having become damaged, no\r\none could be found to repair it; and thus did the very injury which\r\nthe picture had sustained, redound to the glory of the artist. Time,\r\nhowever, and damp at last effaced the painting, and Nero, in his reign,\r\nhad it replaced by a copy, painted by the hand of Dorotheus.[2021]\r\nApelles also commenced another Venus for the people of Cos,[2022]\r\nwhich would have outshone even the former one; but death invidiously\r\nprevented its completion, nor could any one be found to complete the\r\nwork in conformity with the sketches of the outline. He painted also,\r\nin the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, Alexander the Great wielding the\r\nThunderbolts, a picture for which he received twenty talents of gold.\r\nThe fingers have all the appearance of projecting from the surface,\r\nand the lightning seems to be darting from the picture. And then, too,\r\nlet the reader bear in mind that all these works were executed by the\r\naid of four[2023] colours only. The price paid in golden coin for this\r\npicture was ascertained by weight,[2024] there being no specific sum\r\nagreed upon.\r\n\r\nHe also painted a Procession of the Megabyzus,[2025] the priest of\r\nDiana at Ephesus; and a Clitus[2026] on Horseback, hastening to the\r\ncombat, his Armour-bearer handing him his helmet at his command.\r\nHow many times he painted Alexander and Philip, it would be quite\r\nsuperfluous to attempt to enumerate. At Samos, there is a Habron[2027]\r\nby him, that is greatly admired; at Rhodes a Menander,[2028] king\r\nof Caria, and an Ancæus;[2029] at Alexandria, a Gorgosthenes, the\r\nTragedian; and at Rome, a Castor and Pollux, with figures of Victory\r\nand Alexander the Great, and an emblematical figure of War with her\r\nhands tied behind her, and Alexander seated in a triumphal car; both\r\nof which pictures the late Emperor Augustus, with a great degree of\r\nmoderation[2030] and good taste, consecrated in the most frequented\r\nparts of his Forum: the Emperor Claudius, however, thought it advisable\r\nto efface the head of Alexander in both pictures, and substitute\r\nlikenesses of his predecessor Augustus. It is by his hand too, it is\r\ngenerally supposed, that the Hercules, with the face averted, now in\r\nthe Temple of Anna,[2031] was painted; a picture in which, one of the\r\ngreatest difficulties in the art, the face, though hidden, may be\r\nsaid to be seen rather than left to the imagination. He also painted\r\na figure of a naked[2032] Hero,[2033] a picture in which he has\r\nchallenged Nature herself.\r\n\r\nThere exists too, or did exist, a Horse that was painted by him for a\r\npictorial contest; as to the merits of which, Apelles appealed from\r\nthe judgment of his fellow-men to that of the dumb quadrupeds. For,\r\nfinding that by their intrigues his rivals were likely to get the\r\nbetter of him, he had some horses brought, and the picture of each\r\nartist successively shown to them. Accordingly, it was only at the\r\nsight of the horse painted by Apelles that they began to neigh; a\r\nthing that has always been the case since, whenever this test of his\r\nartistic skill has been employed. He also painted a Neoptolemus[2034]\r\non horse-back, fighting with the Persians; an Archeläus,[2035] with his\r\nWife and Daughter; and an Antigonus on foot, with a cuirass on, and\r\nhis horse led by his side. Connoisseurs in the art give the preference,\r\nbefore all other works of his, to his paintings of King Archeläus on\r\nhorseback, and of Diana in the midst of a throng of Virgins performing\r\na sacrifice; a work in which he would appear to have surpassed the\r\nlines[2036] of Homer descriptive of the same subject. He also portrayed\r\nsome things, which in reality do not admit of being portrayed—thunder,\r\nlightning, and thunderbolts, in pictures which are known by the\r\nrespective names of Bronte, Astrape, and Ceraunobolia.\r\n\r\nHis inventions, too, in the art of painting, have been highly\r\nserviceable to others; but one thing there was in which no one could\r\nimitate him. When his works were finished, he used to cover them\r\nwith a black varnish, of such remarkable thinness, that while by the\r\nreflection it gave more vivacity to the colours, and preserved them\r\nfrom the contact of dust and dirt, its existence could only be detected\r\nby a person when close enough to touch it.[2037] In addition to this,\r\nthere was also this other great advantage attending it: the brightness\r\nof the colours was softened thereby, and harmonized to the sight,\r\nlooking as though they had been viewed from a distance, and through a\r\nmedium of specular-stone;[2038] the contrivance, by some indescribable\r\nmeans, giving a sombreness to colours which would otherwise have been\r\ntoo florid.\r\n\r\nOne of the contemporaries of Apelles was Aristides[2039] of Thebes; the\r\nfirst of all the painters to give full expression to the mind[2040]\r\nand passions of man, known to the Greeks as ἤθη, as well\r\nas to the mental perturbations which we experience: he was somewhat\r\nharsh, however, in his colours. There is a picture by him of a Captured\r\nCity, in which is represented an infant crawling toward the breast of\r\nits wounded mother, who, though at the point of death, has all the\r\nappearance of being aware of it, and of being in dread lest the child\r\nshould suck blood in place of milk from her exhausted breast: this\r\npicture Alexander the Great ordered to be transferred to Pella, his\r\nnative place. Aristides also painted a Battle with the Persians, a\r\npicture which contained one hundred figures, for each of which he was\r\npaid at the rate of ten minæ by Mnason, the tyrant of Elatea.[2041] He\r\nalso painted Chariots with four horses in full career; a Suppliant,\r\nwhich almost speaks, Huntsmen with game; Leontion, the mistress of\r\nEpicurus; the Anapauomene,[2042] a damsel pining to death from love\r\nfor her brother; a Father Liber[2043] also, and an Artamene, two\r\nfine pictures now to be seen in the Temple of Ceres[2044] at Rome; a\r\nTragedian and a Child, in the Temple of Apollo,[2045] a picture which\r\nhas lost its beauty, owing to the unskilfulness of the painter to\r\nwhom M. Junius, the prætor, entrusted the cleaning of it, about the\r\nperiod of the Apollinarian Games.[2046] There was also to be seen, in\r\nthe Temple of Faith, in the Capitol, a picture of his, representing\r\nan Aged Man giving instructions to a Child on the lyre. He executed\r\nalso a painting of an Invalid, upon which endless encomiums have been\r\nlavished. Indeed, so great was the excellence of this artist, that King\r\nAttalus, it is said, purchased one picture of his at the price of one\r\nhundred talents.\r\n\r\nAt the same period[2047] flourished Protogenes, as already stated.\r\nHe was a native of Caunus,[2048] a place held in subjection by the\r\nRhodians. Great poverty in his early days, and extreme application to\r\nhis art, were the causes of his comparative unproductiveness. It is\r\nnot known with certainty from whom he received his instruction in the\r\nart: indeed some say that he was only a ship-decorator down to his\r\nfiftieth year; a proof of which, it is asserted, is the fact, that in\r\ndecorating the Propylæum[2049] of the Temple of Minerva, situate in one\r\nof the most celebrated spots in Athens, where he has painted the fine\r\npicture[2050] of Paralus and Hammonias, known by some as the Nausicaa,\r\nhe has added in the side pieces of the picture, by painters called\r\n“parerga,” several small ships of war;[2051] wishing thereby to show\r\nin what department that skill had first manifested itself which had\r\nthus reached the citadel of Athens, the scene of his glory. Of all his\r\ncompositions, however, the palm has been awarded to his Ialysus,[2052]\r\nnow at Rome, consecrated in the Temple of Peace there. So long as he\r\nwas at work upon it, he lived, it is said, upon nothing but soaked\r\nlupines; by which means he at once appeased both hunger and thirst, and\r\navoided all risk of blunting his perception by too delicate a diet.\r\nIn order to protect this picture against the effects of ill-usage and\r\nold age, he painted it over four times,[2053] so that when an upper\r\ncoat might fail, there would be an under one to succeed it. There is\r\nin this picture the figure of a dog, which was completed in a very\r\nremarkable manner, inasmuch as accident had an equal share with design\r\nin the execution of it. The painter was of opinion that he had not\r\ngiven the proper expression to the foam at the mouth of the animal,\r\npanting for breath, as it was represented; while, with all other parts\r\nof the picture, a thing extremely difficult with him, he was perfectly\r\nsatisfied. The thing that displeased him was, the evident traces of art\r\nin the execution of it, touches which did not admit of any diminution,\r\nand yet had all the appearance of being too laboured, the effect\r\nproduced being far removed from his conception of the reality: the\r\nfoam, in fact, bore the marks of being painted, and not of being the\r\nnatural secretion of the animal’s mouth. Vexed and tormented by this\r\ndilemma, it being his wish to depict truth itself, and not something\r\nthat only bore a semblance of truth, he effaced it again and again,\r\nchanged his pencil for another, and yet by no possibility could satisfy\r\nhimself. At last, quite out of temper with an art, which, in spite\r\nof him, would still obtrude itself, he dashed his sponge against the\r\nvexatious spot; when behold! the sponge replaced the colours that it\r\nhad just removed, exactly in accordance with his utmost wishes, and\r\nthus did chance represent Nature in a painting.\r\n\r\nFollowing his example, Nealces,[2054] it is said, succeeded in\r\nrepresenting the foam at a horse’s mouth; for on one occasion, when\r\nengaged in painting a man holding in a pair of horses and soothing them\r\nwith his voice,[2055] he also dashed his sponge against the picture,\r\nwith the view of producing a like effect.\r\n\r\nIt was on account of this Ialysus, which he was apprehensive of\r\ndestroying, that King Demetrius[2056] forbore to set fire to the only\r\nside of the city of Rhodes by which it was capable of being taken;\r\nand thus, in his anxiety to spare a picture, did he lose his only\r\nopportunity of gaining a victory. The dwelling of Protogenes at this\r\nperiod was situate in a little garden in the suburbs, or in other\r\nwords, in the midst of the camp of Demetrius. The combats that were\r\ntaking place made no difference whatever to the artist, and in no way\r\ninterrupted his proceeding with the works which he had commenced; until\r\nat last he was summoned before the king, who enquired how he could have\r\nthe assurance thus to remain without the walls. “Because I know,” was\r\nhis answer, “that you are waging war with the Rhodians, and not with\r\nthe arts.” Upon this, the king, delighted at having the opportunity\r\nof protecting the hand which he had thus spared, ordered a guard to\r\nbe placed at his disposal for the especial purpose of his protection.\r\nIn order, too, that he might not distract the artist’s attention by\r\nsending for him too often, he would often go, an enemy albeit, to pay\r\nhim a visit, and, abandoning his aspirations for victory, in the midst\r\nof arms and the battering down of walls, would attentively examine the\r\ncompositions of the painter. Even to this day, the story is still\r\nattached to the picture which he was then engaged upon, to the effect,\r\nthat Protogenes painted it beneath the sword. It is his Satyr, known as\r\nthe “Anapauomenos;”[2057] in whose hand, to mark the sense of security\r\nthat he felt, the painter has placed a pair of pipes.\r\n\r\nProtogenes executed also, a Cydippe; a Tlepolemus; a portrait of\r\nPhiliscus, the tragic poet, in an attitude of meditation; an Athlete; a\r\nportrait of King Antigonus, and one of the mother of Aristotle.[2058]\r\nIt was this philosopher too, who advised him to paint the exploits\r\nof Alexander the Great, as being certain to be held in everlasting\r\nremembrance. The impulse, however, of his natural disposition, combined\r\nwith a certain artistic caprice, led him in preference to adopt the\r\nvarious subjects which have just been mentioned. His last works were\r\nrepresentations of Alexander and the god Pan. He also executed some\r\nfigures in bronze, as already[2059] stated.\r\n\r\nAt the same period also, lived Asclepiodorus,[2060] who was greatly\r\nadmired by Apelles for his proportions. The tyrant Mnason[2061] paid\r\nhim, for his picture of the Twelve Gods, at the rate of thirty minæ for\r\neach divinity. This same Mnason also paid Theomnestus twenty minæ for\r\neach of his Heroes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, it is only proper to mention Nicomachus,[2062]\r\nthe son and disciple of Aristiæus. He painted a Rape of Proserpina,\r\na picture that was formerly in the Temple of Minerva in the Capitol,\r\nabove the shrine of Juventas.[2063] Another picture of his was to\r\nbe seen also in the Capitol, placed there by the Roman general\r\nPlancus,[2064] a Victory soaring aloft in a chariot: he was the\r\nfirst painter who represented Ulysses wearing the pileus.[2065]\r\nHe painted also an Apollo and Diana; the Mother[2066] of the Gods\r\nseated on a Lion; the fine picture of the Bacchantes, with Satyrs\r\nmoving stealthily towards them; and a Scylla, now at Rome in the\r\nTemple of Peace. No painter ever worked with greater rapidity than\r\nNicomachus; indeed it is said, that on one occasion having entered\r\ninto an engagement with Aristratus,[2067] the tyrant of Sicyon, to\r\npaint within a given time the monument which he was raising to the\r\nmemory of the poet Telestis,[2068] the artist only arrived a few days\r\nbefore the expiration of the term; upon which, the tyrant was so angry\r\nthat he threatened to punish him: however, in the few days that were\r\nleft, Nicomachus, to the admiration of all, completed the work, with\r\nequal promptitude and success. Among his pupils, were his brother\r\nAriston, his son Aristides, and Philoxenus of Eretria, who painted\r\nfor King Cassander a picture representing one of the battles between\r\nAlexander and Darius, a work which may bear comparison with any. He\r\nalso painted a picture in grotesque, representing Three Sileni at\r\ntheir revels. Imitating the celerity of execution displayed by his\r\nmaster, he introduced a more sketchy style of painting, executed in a\r\ncomparatively off-hand manner.[2069]\r\n\r\nTo these artists Nicophanes[2070] has also been added, an elegant and\r\nfinished painter, to whom for gracefulness few can be compared, but for\r\na severe and tragic style far inferior to Zeuxis or Apelles. Perseus\r\nalso belongs to this period, a pupil of Apelles, who dedicated to him\r\nhis work on painting. Aristides of Thebes had for pupils his sons\r\nNiceros and Ariston. By the latter of these artists, there is a Satyr\r\ncrowned with a chaplet and holding a goblet: two of his pupils were\r\nAntorides and Euphranor, of the latter of whom we shall have to make\r\nmention again.[2071]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—VARIOUS OTHER KINDS OF PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now, however, make some mention of those artists who acquired\r\nfame by the pencil in an inferior style of painting. Among these\r\nwas Piræicus, inferior to few of the painters in skill. I am not\r\nsure that he did not do injustice to himself by the choice of his\r\nsubjects,[2072] seeing that, although he adopted an humble walk, he\r\nstill attained in that walk the highest reputation. His subjects were\r\nbarbers’ shops, cobblers’ stalls, jackasses, eatables, and the like,\r\nand to these he was indebted for his epithet of “Rhyparographos.”[2073]\r\nHis paintings, however, are exquisitely pleasing, and have sold at\r\nhigher prices than the very largest works of many masters.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand again, as Varro tells us, a single picture by\r\nSerapio covered the whole space of the balustrades,[2074] beneath\r\nthe Old Shops,[2075] where it was exhibited. This artist was very\r\nsuccessful in painting stage-scenery, but was unable to depict the\r\nhuman form. Dionysius,[2076] on the contrary, painted nothing but men,\r\nand hence it was that he had the surname of “Anthropographos.”[2077]\r\nCallicles[2078] also painted some small pictures, and Calates\r\nexecuted some small works in the comic style. Both of these styles\r\nwere adopted by Antiphilus;[2079] who painted a very fine Hesione,\r\nand a Philip and Alexander with Minerva, now in the School of the\r\nPorticos[2080] of Octavia. In the Portico of Philippus,[2081] also,\r\nthere is a Father Liber[2082] by him; an Alexander when a child; and\r\nan Hippolytus alarmed at the Bull, which is rushing upon him:[2083]\r\nand in the Portico of Pompeius[2084] we have his Cadmus and Europa. On\r\nthe other hand, again, he painted a figure in a ridiculous costume,\r\nknown jocosely as the Gryllus; and hence it is that pictures of this\r\nclass[2085] are generally known as “Grylli.” Antiphilus was a native of\r\nEgypt, and received instruction in the art from Ctesidemus.[2086]\r\n\r\nIt would not be right to pass in silence the painter of the Temple\r\nat Ardea,[2087] the more particularly as he was honoured with the\r\ncitizenship at that place, and with the following inscription in verse\r\nupon one of the paintings which he executed there:\r\n\r\n  “These paintings, worthy of this worthy place,\r\n  Temple of Juno, queen, and wife of Jove,\r\n  Plautius Marcus,[2088] from Alalia, made.\r\n  May Ardea now and ever praise him for his skill.”\r\n\r\nThese lines are written in ancient Latin characters.\r\n\r\nLudius too, who lived in the time of the late Emperor Augustus, must\r\nnot be allowed to pass without some notice; for he was the first\r\nto introduce the fashion of covering the walls of our houses with\r\nmost pleasing landscapes, representing villas, porticos, ornamental\r\ngardening, woods, groves, hills, fishponds, canals,[2089] rivers,\r\nsea-shores, and anything else one could desire; varied with figures of\r\npersons walking, sailing, or proceeding to their villas, on asses or\r\nin carriages. Then, too, there are others to be seen fishing, fowling,\r\nor gathering in the vintage. In some of his decorations there are\r\nfine villas to be seen, and roads to them across the marshes, with\r\nwomen making[2090] bargains to be carried across on men’s shoulders,\r\nwho move along slipping at every step and tottering beneath their\r\nload; with numberless other subjects of a similar nature, redolent of\r\nmirth and of the most amusing ingenuity. It was this artist, too, who\r\nfirst decorated our uncovered[2091] edifices with representations of\r\nmaritime cities, a subject which produces a most pleasing effect, and\r\nat a very trifling expense.\r\n\r\nBut as for fame, that has been reserved solely for the artists who\r\nhave painted pictures; a thing that gives us all the more reason to\r\nvenerate the prudence displayed by the men of ancient times. For with\r\nthem, it was not the practice to decorate the walls of houses, for\r\nthe gratification of the owners only; nor did they lavish all their\r\nresources upon a dwelling which must of necessity always remain a\r\nfixture in one spot, and admits of no removal in case of conflagration.\r\nProtogenes was content with a cottage in his little garden; Apelles\r\nhad no paintings on the plaster of his walls; it not being the fashion\r\nin their day to colour the party-walls of houses from top to bottom.\r\nWith all those artists, art was ever watchful for the benefit of whole\r\ncities only, and in those times a painter was regarded as the common\r\nproperty of all.\r\n\r\nShortly before the time of the late Emperor Augustus, Arellius was in\r\nhigh esteem at Rome; and with fair reason, had he not profaned the art\r\nby a disgraceful piece of profanity; for, being always in love with\r\nsome woman or other, it was his practice, in painting goddesses, to\r\ngive them the features of his mistresses; hence it is, that there were\r\nalways some figures of prostitutes to be seen in his pictures. More\r\nrecently, lived Amulius,[2092] a grave and serious personage, but a\r\npainter in the florid style. By this artist there was a Minerva, which\r\nhad the appearance of always looking at the spectators, from whatever\r\npoint it was viewed. He only painted a few hours each day, and then\r\nwith the greatest gravity, for he always kept the toga on, even when in\r\nthe midst of his implements. The Golden Palace[2093] of Nero was the\r\nprison-house of this artist’s productions, and hence it is that there\r\nare so few of them to be be seen elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNext in repute to him were Cornelius Pinus and Attius Priscus, who\r\npainted the Temple of Honour and that of Virtue,[2094] on their\r\nrestoration by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus. Priscus approaches\r\nmore closely to the ancient masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38. (11.)—AN EFFECTUAL WAY OF PUTTING A STOP TO THE SINGING OF\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must not omit here, in reference to painting, a celebrated story that\r\nis told about Lepidus. During the Triumvirate, when he was entertained\r\nby the magistrates of a certain place, he had lodgings given him\r\nin a house that was wholly surrounded with trees. The next day, he\r\ncomplained to them in a threatening tone, that he had been unable to\r\nsleep for the singing of the birds there. Accordingly, they had a\r\ndragon painted, on pieces of parchment of the greatest length that\r\ncould possibly be obtained, and surrounded the grove with it; a thing\r\nthat so terrified the birds, it is said, that they became silent at\r\nonce; and hence it was that it first became known how this object could\r\nbe attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—ARTISTS WHO HAVE PAINTED IN ENCAUSTICS OR WAX, WITH EITHER\r\nTHE CESTRUM OR THE PENCIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not agreed who was the inventor of the art of painting in wax and\r\nin encaustic.[2095] Some think that it was a discovery of the painter\r\nAristides,[2096] and that it was afterwards brought to perfection\r\nby Praxiteles: but there are encaustic paintings in existence, of a\r\nsomewhat prior date to them, those by Polygnotus,[2097] for example,\r\nand by Nicanor and Arcesilaüs,[2098] natives of Paros. Elasippus too,\r\nhas inscribed upon a picture of his at Ægina, the word ἐνέκαεν;[2099]\r\na thing that he certainly could not have done, if the art of encaustic\r\npainting had not been then invented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—THE FIRST INVENTORS OF VARIOUS KINDS OF PAINTING. THE\r\nGREATEST DIFFICULTIES IN THE ART OF PAINTING. THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF\r\nPAINTING. THE FIRST ARTIST THAT PAINTED CEILINGS. WHEN ARCHED ROOFS\r\nWERE FIRST PAINTED. THE MARVELLOUS PRICE OF SOME PICTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said, too, that Pamphilus,[2100] the instructor of Apelles,\r\nnot only painted in encaustic, but also instructed Pausias[2101] of\r\nSicyon in the art, the first who rendered himself distinguished in\r\nthis branch. Pausias was the son of Bryetes, by whom he was originally\r\ninstructed in the art of painting. He retouched also with the\r\npencil[2102] some walls at Thespiæ, then undergoing repair, which had\r\nformerly been painted by Polygnotus. Upon instituting a comparison,\r\nhowever, it was considered that he was greatly inferior, this kind\r\nof painting not being in his line. It was he, too, who first thought\r\nof painting ceilings: nor had it been the practice before his day to\r\nuse this kind of decoration for arched roofs. He painted many small\r\npictures also, miniatures of children more particularly; a thing which,\r\naccording to the interpretation put upon it by his rivals, was owing\r\nto the peculiarly slow process of encaustic painting. The consequence\r\nwas, that being determined to give a memorable proof of his celerity of\r\nexecution, he completed a picture in the space of a single day, which\r\nwas thence called the “Hemeresios,”[2103] representing the portrait of\r\na child.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, he was enamoured of Glycera,[2104] his fellow-townswoman,\r\nthe first inventor of chaplets; and in his rivalry of the skill\r\nshown by her, he achieved so much success in the encaustic art,\r\nas to reproduce the almost numberless tints displayed by flowers.\r\nAt a later period, he painted her, seated, with a chaplet on, and\r\nthus produced one of the very finest of his pictures; known as the\r\n“Stephaneplocos”[2105] by some, and as the “Stephanopolis”[2106] by\r\nothers; from the circumstance that Glycera had supported herself in\r\nher poverty by selling these chaplets. A copy of this picture, usually\r\nknown as an “apographon,”[2107] was purchased by L. Lucullus at Athens,\r\nduring the festival of the Dionysia, at the price of two talents.\r\n\r\nPausias also painted some large pictures, a Sacrifice of Oxen, for\r\ninstance, which used to be seen in the Portico of Pompeius. In this\r\npainting he invented several improvements, which many artists have\r\nsince imitated, but none with the same success. Although in the picture\r\nit was particularly his desire to give an impression of the length of\r\nthe ox, he painted it with a front view and not sideways, and still\r\nhas caused the large dimensions of the animal to be fully understood.\r\nAnd then too, whereas all other painters colour in white such parts as\r\nthey wish to have the appearance of being prominent, and in black such\r\nportions as are intended to remain in the back-ground, he has painted\r\nthe whole of the ox of a black colour, and has shown the dimensions of\r\nthe body which throws the shadow by the medium of the shadow itself;\r\nthus evincing a wonderful degree of skill in showing relief upon a coat\r\npainted with a single colour, and conveying an impression of uniform\r\nsolidity upon a broken ground.[2108] It was at Sicyon also that Pausias\r\npassed his life, a city which for a long time continued to be the\r\nnative place of painting. Ultimately, all the paintings belonging to\r\nthat place were sold by public auction for the discharge of the debts\r\nowing by the city, and were transferred to Rome in the ædileship of\r\nScaurus.[2109]\r\n\r\nNext to him, in the hundred and fourth Olympiad, Euphranor,[2110]\r\nthe Isthmian, distinguished himself far beyond all others, an artist\r\nwho has been already mentioned in our account of the statuaries. He\r\nexecuted some colossal figures also, and some statues in marble, and\r\nhe chased some drinking-vessels; being studious and laborious in the\r\nhighest degree, excellent in every branch, and at all times equal\r\nto himself. This artist seems to have been the first to represent\r\nheroes with becoming dignity, and to have paid particular attention to\r\nsymmetry. Still, however, in the generality of instances, he has made\r\nthe body slight in proportion to the head and limbs. He composed some\r\ntreatises also upon symmetry and colours. His works are, an Equestrian\r\nCombat;[2111] the Twelve Gods; and a Theseus; with reference to which\r\nhe remarked that the Theseus of Parrhasius had been fed upon roses, but\r\nhis own upon beef.[2112] There are also at Ephesus some famous pictures\r\nby him; an Ulysses, in his feigned madness, yoking together an ox and\r\na horse; Men, in an attitude of meditation, wearing the pallium;[2113]\r\nand a Warrior, sheathing his sword.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, also, flourished Cydias;[2114] for whose picture of\r\nthe Argonautæ the orator Hortensius paid one hundred and forty-four\r\nthousand sesterces, and had a shrine constructed expressly for its\r\nreception on his estate at Tusculum.[2115] There was also Antidotus,\r\na pupil of Euphranor, by whom there is, at Athens, a Combatant armed\r\nwith a shield; a Wrestler, also; and a Trumpeter, a work which has been\r\nconsidered a most exquisite production.\r\n\r\nAntidotus, as a painter, was more careful in his works than prolific,\r\nand his colouring was of a severe style. His principal glory was\r\nhis having been the instructor of Nicias[2116] of Athens; who was a\r\nmost careful painter of female portraits, and a strict observer of\r\nlight and shade,[2117] making it his especial care that the figures\r\nin his pictures should appear in the boldest relief. His works are,\r\na Nemea, which was brought from Asia to Rome by Silanus, and was\r\nplaced in the Curia, as already stated;[2118] a Father Liber,[2119]\r\nin the Temple[2120] of Concord; a Hyacinthus,[2121] which the Emperor\r\nAugustus was so delighted with, that he took it away with him after\r\nthe capture of Alexandria; for which reason also it was consecrated\r\nin the Temple[2122] of Augustus by the Emperor Tiberius; and a\r\nDanaë. At Ephesus, there is a tomb by him of a megabyzus,[2123] or\r\npriest of the Ephesian Diana; and at Athens a representation of the\r\nNecyomantea[2124] of Homer; which last he declined to sell to King\r\nAttalus for sixty talents, and in preference, so rich was he, made a\r\npresent of it to his own native place. He also executed some large\r\npictures, among which there are a Calypso, an Io, an Andromeda, a very\r\nfine Alexander, in the Porticos[2125] of Pompeius, and a Calypso,\r\nseated. To this painter also there are some pictures of cattle\r\nattributed, and in his dogs he has been remarkably successful. It\r\nwas this Nicias, with reference to whom, Praxiteles, when asked with\r\nwhich of all his works in marble he was the best pleased, made answer,\r\n“Those to which Nicias has set his hand,” so highly did he esteem the\r\ncolouring of that artist. It has not been satisfactorily ascertained\r\nwhether it is this artist or another of the same name that some writers\r\nhave placed in the hundred and twelfth Olympiad.\r\n\r\nWith Nicias has been compared, and indeed sometimes preferred to\r\nhim, Athenion of Maronea,[2126] a pupil of Glaucion of Corinth. In\r\nhis colouring he is more sombre than Nicias, and yet, with all his\r\nsombreness, more pleasing; so much so indeed, that in his paintings\r\nshines forth the extensive knowledge which he possessed of the art. He\r\npainted, in the Temple at Eleusis, a Phylarchus;[2127] and at Athens,\r\na family group, which has been known as the “Syngenicon;”[2128] an\r\nAchilles also, concealed in a female dress, and Ulysses detecting him;\r\na group of six whole-length figures, in one picture; and, a work which\r\nhas contributed to his fame more than any other, a Groom leading a\r\nHorse. Indeed, if he had not died young, there would have been no one\r\ncomparable to Athenion in painting.\r\n\r\nHeraclides, too, of Macedon, had some repute as an artist. At first\r\nhe was a painter of ships, but afterwards, on the capture of King\r\nPerseus, he removed to Athens; where at the same period was also\r\nMetrodorus,[2129] who was both a painter and a philosopher, and of\r\nconsiderable celebrity in both branches. Hence it was, that when L.\r\nPaulus Æmilius, after the conquest of Perseus,[2130] requested the\r\nAthenians to send him the most esteemed philosopher for the education\r\nof his children, and a painter to represent his triumph, they made\r\nchoice of Metrodorus, declaring that he was eminently suited for either\r\npurpose; a thing which Paulus admitted to be the case.\r\n\r\nTimomachus of Byzantium, in the time of the Dictator Cæsar, painted an\r\nAjax[2131] and a Medea, which were placed by Cæsar in the Temple of\r\nVenus Genetrix, having been purchased at the price of eighty talents;\r\nthe value of the Attic talent being, according to M. Varro, equivalent\r\nto six thousand denarii. An Orestes, also by Timomachus, an Iphigenia\r\nin Tauris, and a Lecythion, a teacher of gymnastics, are equally\r\npraised; a Noble Family also; and Two Men clothed in the pallium,[2132]\r\nand about to enter into conversation, the one standing, the other in\r\na sitting posture. It is in his picture, however of the Gorgon,[2133]\r\nthat the art appears to have favoured him most highly.\r\n\r\nAristolaüs, the son and pupil of Pausias, was one of the painters in\r\na more severe style: there are by him an Epaminondas, a Pericles, a\r\nMedea, a Theseus, an emblematical picture of the Athenian People,\r\nand a Sacrifice of Oxen. Some persons, too, are pleased with the\r\ncareful style of Nicophanes,[2134] who was also a pupil of Pausias; a\r\ncarefulness, however, which only artists can appreciate, as in other\r\nrespects he was harsh in his colours, and too lavish of sil;[2135]\r\nas in his picture, for example, of Æsculapius with his daughters,\r\nHygia,[2136] Ægle, and Panacea, his Jason, and his Sluggard, known as\r\nthe “Ocnos,”[2137] a man twisting a rope at one end as an ass gnaws it\r\nat the other. As to Socrates,[2138] his pictures are, with good reason,\r\nuniversally esteemed.\r\n\r\nHaving now mentioned the principal painters in either branch,[2139] I\r\nmust not pass in silence those who occupy the next rank. Aristoclides\r\ndecorated the Temple of Apollo at Delphi. Antiphilus[2140] is highly\r\npraised for his picture of a Boy blowing a Fire, which illumines\r\nan apartment handsomely furnished, and throws a light[2141] upon\r\nthe features of the youth; a Spinning-room, with women plying their\r\nrespective tasks; and a King Ptolemæus hunting. But his most famous\r\npicture is his Satyr, clad in a panther’s skin, and known as the\r\n“Aposcopeuon.”[2142] Aristophon[2143] has painted an Ancæus[2144]\r\nwounded by the Boar, with Astypale, the sharer of his grief; and a\r\npicture with numerous figures, representing Priam, Helena, Credulity,\r\nUlysses, Deiphobus, and Guile.[2145] Androbius has painted a\r\nScyllus[2146] cutting away the anchors of the Persian fleet: and\r\nArtemon a Danaë, with Robbers in admiration; a Queen Stratonice;[2147]\r\nand a Hercules and Deianira. But the finest of all this artist’s works\r\nare those now in the buildings of Octavia; a Hercules ascending to\r\nheaven, with the sanction of the gods, from his funeral pile upon Mount\r\nŒta in Doris; and the story of Laomedon and his bargain[2148] with\r\nHercules and Neptune. Alcimachus has painted Dioxippus,[2149] who was\r\nvictorious in the pancratium at Olympia, without raising the dust; a\r\nvictory known to the Greeks as being gained “aconiti.”[2150] Cœnus\r\npainted pedigrees.[2151]\r\n\r\nCtesilochus, a pupil[2152] of Apelles, was famous for a burlesque\r\npicture of his representing Jupiter in labour with Bacchus,[2153] with\r\na mitra[2154] on his head, and crying like a woman in the midst of the\r\ngoddesses, who are acting as midwives. Cleon distinguished himself by\r\nhis Cadmus; and Ctesidemus, by his Capture of Œchalia[2155] and his\r\nLaodamia.\r\n\r\nCtesicles became notorious for the insult which he offered to Queen\r\nStratonice;[2156] for, upon failing to meet with an honourable\r\nreception from her, he painted her, romping with a fisherman, for\r\nwhom, according to common report, she had conceived an ardent\r\naffection. After exhibiting this picture in the harbour at Ephesus,\r\nhe at once set sail and escaped: the queen, however, would not allow\r\nof its removal, the likenesses of the two figures being so admirably\r\nexpressed. Cratinus,[2157] the comic writer, painted at Athens, in the\r\nPompeion[2158] there.\r\n\r\nOf Eutychides, there is a Victory guiding a chariot drawn by two\r\nhorses. Eudorus is famous for his dramatic scenery; he executed some\r\nstatues in bronze also. By Hippys there is a Neptune and Victory.\r\nHabron painted a picture of Friendship and Concord, and several\r\nfigures of divinities; Leontiscus, an Aratus with the trophies of\r\nvictory,[2159] and a Singing-girl; Leon, a portrait of Sappho; and\r\nNearchus, a Venus attended by Cupids and Graces, and a Hercules,\r\nsorrowing and repentant at the sad results of his madness.[2160]\r\nNealces,[2161] a remarkably ingenious and inventive artist, painted a\r\nVenus. On one occasion, when he had to represent a naval engagement\r\nbetween the Persians and Egyptians, wishing it to be understood that\r\nit took place on the river Nilus, the waters of which are similar in\r\nappearance to those of the sea, he employed an emblem to disclose that\r\nwhich would not admit of expression by art; for he painted an ass\r\ndrinking on the shore, and a crocodile lying in wait for him.[2162]\r\n\r\nŒnias has painted a Family Group; Philiscus, a Painter’s Studio, with\r\na boy blowing the fire; Phalerion, a Scylla; Simonides, an Agatharchus\r\nand a Mnemosyne; Simus, a youth reposing, a Fuller’s Shop, a person\r\ncelebrating the Quinquatria,[2163] and a Nemesis of great merit. By\r\nTheorus[2164] there is a Man Anointing himself; a picture of the\r\nMurder of Ægisthus and Clytæmnestra by Orestes; and a representation\r\nof the Trojan War, in a series of paintings, now at Rome, in the\r\nPorticos[2165] of Philippus: a Cassandra[2166] also, in the Temple\r\nof Concord; a Leontium, the mistress of Epicurus, in an attitude of\r\nmeditation; and a King Demetrius.[2167] Theon[2168] has painted the\r\nFrenzy[2169] of Orestes, and a Thamyras[2170] playing on the lyre;\r\nTauriscus, a Discobolus,[2171] a Clytæmnestra, a Pan in miniature, a\r\nPolynices claiming[2172] the sovereignty, and a Capaneus.[2173]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of these artists, I must not omit to mention one memorable\r\ncircumstance: Erigonus, who was colour-grinder to the painter Nealces,\r\nhimself made such progress in the art as to leave a very celebrated\r\npupil, Pasias, the brother of Ægineta, the modeller. It is also a\r\nvery singular fact, and one well deserving of remark, that the last\r\nworks of these artists, their unfinished paintings, in fact, are\r\nheld in greater admiration than their completed works; the Iris of\r\nAristides, for instance, the Tyndaridæ[2174] of Nicomachus, the Medea\r\nof Timomachus,[2175] and the Venus of Apelles,[2176] already mentioned.\r\nFor in such works as these, we not only see the outline depicted, and\r\nthe very thoughts of the artist expressed, but have the composition\r\nadditionally commended to our notice by the regrets which we must\r\nnecessarily feel on finding the hand that commenced it arrested by\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThere are still some other artists, who, though by no means without\r\nreputation, can only be noticed here in a summary manner: Aristocydes;\r\nAnaxander; Aristobulus of Syria; Arcesilas,[2177] son of Tisicrates;\r\nCorœbos, a pupil of Nicomachus; Charmantides, a pupil of Euphranor;\r\nDionysodorus of Colophon; Dicæogenes, a contemporary of King\r\nDemetrius;[2178] Euthymides; Heraclides[2179] of Macedon; Milo of Soli,\r\na pupil of the statuary Pyromachus; Mnasitheus of Sicyon; Mnasitimus,\r\nthe son and pupil of Aristonidas;[2180] Nessus, son of Habron;[2181]\r\nPolemon of Alexandria; Theodorus of Samos, and Stadieus, pupils of\r\nNicosthenes; and Xeno of Sicyon, a pupil of Neocles.\r\n\r\nThere have been some female painters also. Timarete, the daughter\r\nof Micon,[2182] painted a Diana at Ephesus, one of the very oldest\r\npanel-paintings known. Irene, daughter and pupil of the artist\r\nCratinus,[2183] painted a figure of a girl, now at Eleusis, a Calypso,\r\nan Aged Man, the juggler Theodorus, and Alcisthenes the dancer.\r\nAristarete, daughter and pupil of Nearchus, painted an Æsculapius.\r\nIaia of Cyzicus, who always remained single, painted at Rome, in the\r\nyouth of M. Varro, both with the brush, and with the graver,[2184] upon\r\nivory, her subjects being female portraits mostly. At Naples, there\r\nis a large picture by her, the portrait of an Old Woman; as also a\r\nportrait of herself, taken by the aid of a mirror. There was no painter\r\nsuperior to her for expedition; while at the same time her artistic\r\nskill was such, that her works sold at much higher prices than those\r\nof the most celebrated portrait-painters of her day, Sopolis namely,\r\nand Dionysius,[2185] with whose pictures our galleries are filled. One\r\nOlympias painted also, but nothing is known relative to her, except\r\nthat she had Autobulus for a pupil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—ENCAUSTIC PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ancient times there were but two methods of encaustic[2186]\r\npainting, in wax and on ivory,[2187] with the cestrum or pointed\r\ngraver. When, however, this art came to be applied to the painting\r\nof ships of war, a third method was adopted, that of melting the wax\r\ncolours and laying them on with a brush, while hot.[2188] Painting of\r\nthis nature,[2189] applied to vessels, will never spoil from the action\r\nof the sun, winds, or salt water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—THE COLOURING OF TISSUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, too, they employ a very remarkable process for the colouring\r\nof tissues. After pressing the material, which is white at first, they\r\nsaturate it, not with colours, but with mordents that are calculated to\r\nabsorb colour. This done, the tissues, still unchanged in appearance,\r\nare plunged into a cauldron of boiling dye, and are removed the next\r\nmoment fully coloured. It is a singular fact, too, that although the\r\ndye in the pan is of one uniform colour, the material when taken out of\r\nit is of various colours, according to the nature of the mordents that\r\nhave been respectively applied to it: these colours, too, will never\r\nwash out. Thus the dye-pan, which under ordinary circumstances, no\r\ndoubt, would have made but one colour of several, if coloured tissues\r\nhad been put into it, is here made to yield several colours from a\r\nsingle dye. At the same moment that it dyes the tissues, it boils in\r\nthe colour; and it is the fact, that material which has been thus\r\nsubmitted to the action of fire becomes stouter and more serviceable\r\nfor wear, than it would have been if it had not been subjected to the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (12.)—THE INVENTORS OF THE ART OF MODELLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn painting we have now said enough, and more than enough; but it will\r\nbe only proper to append some accounts of the plastic art. Butades, a\r\npotter of Sicyon, was the first who invented, at Corinth, the art of\r\nmodelling portraits in the earth which he used in his trade. It was\r\nthrough his daughter that he made the discovery; who, being deeply in\r\nlove with a young man about to depart on a long journey, traced the\r\nprofile of his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp.\r\nUpon seeing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay\r\nupon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then hardened\r\nby fire along with other articles of pottery. This model, it is said,\r\nwas preserved in the Nymphæum[2190] at Corinth, until the destruction\r\nof that city by Mummius.[2191] Others, again, assert that the first\r\ninventors of the plastic art were Rhœcus[2192] and Theodorus,[2193] at\r\nSamos, a considerable period before the expulsion of the Bacchiadæ from\r\nCorinth: and that Damaratus,[2194] on taking to flight from that place\r\nand settling in Etruria, where he became father of Tarquinius, who was\r\nultimately king of the Roman people, was accompanied thither by the\r\nmodellers Euchir,[2195] Diopus, and Eugrammus, by whose agency the art\r\nwas first introduced into Italy.\r\n\r\nButades first invented the method of colouring plastic compositions, by\r\nadding red earth to the material, or else modelling them in red chalk:\r\nhe, too, was the first to make masks on the outer edges of gutter-tiles\r\nupon the roofs of buildings; in low relief, and known as “prostypa”\r\nat first, but afterwards in high relief, or “ectypa.” It was in these\r\ndesigns,[2196] too, that the ornaments on the pediments of temples\r\noriginated; and from this invention modellers first had their name of\r\n“plastæ.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—WHO WAS THE FIRST TO MOULD FIGURES IN IMITATION OF THE\r\nFEATURES OF LIVING PERSONS, OR OF STATUES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first person who expressed the human features by fitting a mould of\r\nplaster upon the face, and then improving it by pouring melted wax into\r\nthe cast, was Lysistratus[2197] of Sicyon, brother of Lysippus, already\r\nmentioned. It was he, in fact, who first made it his study to give a\r\nfaithful likeness; for before his time, artists only thought how to\r\nmake their portraits as handsome as possible. The same artist, too, was\r\nthe first who thought of making models for his statues; a method which\r\nafterwards became so universally adopted, that there could be neither\r\nfigure nor statue made without its model in clay. Hence it would\r\nappear, that the art of modelling in clay is more ancient than that of\r\nmoulding in bronze.[2198]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—THE MOST FAMOUS MODELLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated modellers were Damophilus and Gorgasus, who were\r\npainters as well. These artists adorned with their works, in both\r\nkinds, the Temple of Ceres,[2199] in the Circus Maximus at Rome; with\r\nan inscription in Greek, which stated that the decorations on the\r\nright-hand were the workmanship of Damophilus, and those on the left,\r\nof Gorgasus. Varro says that, before the construction of this temple,\r\neverything was Tuscan[2200] in the temples; and that, when the temple\r\nwas afterwards repaired, the painted coatings of the walls were cut\r\naway in tablets and enclosed in frames, but that the figures on the\r\npediments were dispersed. Chalcosthenes,[2201] too,[2202] executed\r\nat Athens some works in unbaked earth, on the spot which, from his\r\nmanufactory, has since obtained the name of “Ceramicus.”[2203]\r\n\r\nM. Varro states that he knew an artist at Rome, Possis by name, who\r\nexecuted fruit, grapes, and fish, with such exactness, that it was\r\nquite impossible, by only looking at them, to distinguish them from\r\nthe reality. He speaks very highly also of Arcesilaüs,[2204] who was\r\non terms of intimacy with Lucius Lucullus,[2205] and whose models in\r\nplaster used to sell at a higher rate, among artists themselves, than\r\nthe works of others. He informs us, also, that it was by this modeller\r\nthat the Venus Genetrix in the Forum of Cæsar was executed, it having\r\nbeen erected before completion, in the great haste that there was to\r\nconsecrate it; that the same artist had made an agreement with Lucullus\r\nto execute a figure of Felicity, at the price of sixty thousand\r\nsesterces, the completion of which was prevented by their death; and\r\nthat Octavius, a Roman of equestrian rank, being desirous of a model\r\nfor a mixing-bowl,[2206] Arcesilaüs made him one in plaster, at the\r\nprice of one talent.\r\n\r\nVarro praises Pasiteles[2207] also, who used to say, that the plastic\r\nart was the mother of chasing, statuary, and sculpture, and who,\r\nexcellent as he was in each of these branches, never executed any work\r\nwithout first modelling it. In addition to these particulars, he states\r\nthat the art of modelling was anciently cultivated in Italy, Etruria in\r\nparticular; and that Volcanius was summoned from Veii, and entrusted by\r\nTarquinius Priscus with making the figure of Jupiter, which he intended\r\nto consecrate in the Capitol; that this Jupiter was made of clay, and\r\nthat hence arose the custom of painting it with minium;[2208] and that\r\nthe four-horse chariot, so often[2209] mentioned, upon the pediment\r\nof the temple, was made of clay as well. We learn also from him, that\r\nit was by the same artist that the Hercules was executed, which, even\r\nto this day, is named[2210] at Rome from the material of which it is\r\ncomposed. Such, in those times, were the most esteemed statues of the\r\ngods; and small reason have we to complain of our forefathers for\r\nworshipping such divinities as these; for in their day there was no\r\nworking of gold and silver—no, not even in the service of the gods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—WORKS IN POTTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nStatues of this nature are still in existence at various places. At\r\nRome, in fact, and in our municipal towns, we still see many such\r\npediments of temples; wonderful too, for their workmanship, and, from\r\ntheir artistic merit and long duration, more deserving of our respect\r\nthan gold, and certainly far less baneful. At the present day even, in\r\nthe midst of such wealth as we possess, we make our first libation at\r\nthe sacrifice, not from murrhine[2211] vases or vessels of crystal, but\r\nfrom ladles[2212] made of earthenware.\r\n\r\nBounteous beyond expression is the earth, if we only consider in\r\ndetail her various gifts. To omit all mention of the cereals, wine,\r\nfruits, herbs, shrubs, medicaments, and metals, bounties which she has\r\nlavished upon us, and which have already passed under our notice, her\r\nproductions in the shape of pottery alone, would more than suffice, in\r\ntheir variety, to satisfy our domestic wants; what with gutter-tiles of\r\nearthenware, vats for receiving wine, pipes[2213] for conveying water,\r\nconduits[2214] for supplying baths, baked tiles for roofs, bricks for\r\nfoundations, the productions, too, of the potter’s wheel; results, all\r\nof them, of an art, which induced King Numa to establish, as a seventh\r\ncompany,[2215] that of the makers of earthenware.\r\n\r\nEven more than this, many persons have chosen to be buried in\r\ncoffins[2216] made of earthenware; M. Varro, for instance, who was\r\ninterred, in true Pythagorean style, in the midst of leaves of myrtle,\r\nolive, and black poplar; indeed, the greater part of mankind make use\r\nof earthen vases for this purpose. For the service of the table, the\r\nSamian pottery is even yet held in high esteem; that, too, of Arretium\r\nin Italy, still maintains its high character; while for their cups,\r\nand for those only, the manufactories of Surrentum, Asta, Pollentia,\r\nSaguntum in Spain, and Pergamus in Asia,[2217] are greatly esteemed.\r\n\r\nThe city of Tralles, too, in Asia, and that of Mutina in Italy, have\r\ntheir respective manufactures of earthenware, and even by this branch\r\nof art are localities rendered famous; their productions, by the aid of\r\nthe potter’s wheel, becoming known to all countries, and conveyed by\r\nsea and by land to every quarter of the earth. At Erythræ, there are\r\nstill shown, in a temple there, two amphoræ, that were consecrated in\r\nconsequence of the singular thinness of the material: they originated\r\nin a contest between a master and his pupil, which of the two could\r\nmake earthenware of the greatest thinness. The vessels of Cos are the\r\nmost highly celebrated for their beauty, hut those of Adria[2218] are\r\nconsidered the most substantial.\r\n\r\nIn relation to these productions of art, there are some instances of\r\nseverity mentioned: Q. Coponius, we find, was condemned for bribery,\r\nbecause he made present of an amphora of wine to a person who had\r\nthe right of voting. To make luxury, too, conduce in some degree to\r\nenhance our estimation of earthenware, “tripatinium,”[2219] as we learn\r\nfrom Fenestella, was the name given to the most exquisite course of\r\ndishes that was served up at the Roman banquets. It consisted of one\r\ndish of murænæ,[2220] one of lupi,[2221] and a third of a mixture of\r\nfish. It is clear that the public manners were then already on the\r\ndecline; though we still have a right to hold them preferable to those\r\nof the philosophers even of Greece, seeing that the representatives\r\nof Aristotle, it is said, sold, at the auction of his goods, as many\r\nas seventy dishes of earthenware. It has been already[2222] stated by\r\nus, when on the subject of birds, that a single dish cost the tragic\r\nactor Æsopus one hundred thousand sesterces; much to the reader’s\r\nindignation, no doubt; but, by Hercules! Vitellius, when emperor,\r\nordered a dish to be made, which was to cost a million of sesterces,\r\nand for the preparation of which a furnace had to be erected out in the\r\nfields! luxury having thus arrived at such a pitch of excess as to make\r\nearthenware even sell at higher prices than murrhine[2223] vessels. It\r\nwas in reference to this circumstance, that Mucianus, in his second\r\nconsulship, when pronouncing one of his perorations, reproached the\r\nmemory of Vitellius with his dishes as broad as the Pomptine Marsh;\r\nnot less deserving to be execrated than the poisoned dish of Asprenas,\r\nwhich, according to the accusation brought against him by Cassius\r\nSeverus, caused the death of one hundred and thirty guests.[2224]\r\n\r\nThese works of artistic merit have conferred celebrity on some cities\r\neven, Rhegium for example, and Cumæ. The priests of the Mother of\r\nthe gods, known as the Galli, deprive themselves of their virility\r\nwith a piece of Samian[2225] pottery, the only means, if we believe\r\nM. Cælius,[2226] of avoiding dangerous results. He it was, too, who\r\nrecommended, when inveighing against certain abominable practices,\r\nthat the person guilty of them should have his tongue cut out, in a\r\nsimilar manner; a reproach which would appear to have been levelled by\r\nanticipation against this same Vitellius.\r\n\r\nWhat is there that human industry will not devise? Even broken pottery\r\nhas been utilized; it being found that, beaten to powder, and tempered\r\nwith lime, it becomes more solid and durable than other substances\r\nof a similar nature; forming the cement known as the “Signine”[2227]\r\ncomposition, so extensively employed for even making the pavements of\r\nhouses.[2228]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47. (13.)—VARIOUS KINDS OF EARTH, THE PUTEOLAN DUST, AND OTHER\r\nEARTHS OF WHICH CEMENTS LIKE STONE ARE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut there are other resources also, which are derived immediately\r\nfrom the earth. Who, indeed, cannot but be surprised at finding the\r\nmost inferior constituent parts of it, known as “dust”[2229] only,\r\non the hills about Puteoli, forming a barrier against the waves of\r\nthe sea, becoming changed into stone the moment of its immersion, and\r\nincreasing in hardness from day to day—more particularly when mixed\r\nwith the cement of Cumæ? There is an earth too, of a similar nature\r\nfound in the districts about Cyzicus; but there, it is not a dust,\r\nbut a solid earth, which is cut away in blocks of all sizes, and\r\nwhich, after being immersed in the sea, is taken out transformed into\r\nstone. The same thing may be seen also, it is said, in the vicinity of\r\nCassandrea;[2230] and at Cnidos, there is a spring of fresh water which\r\nhas the property of causing earth to petrify within the space of eight\r\nmonths. Between Oropus and Aulis, every portion of the land upon which\r\nthe sea encroaches becomes transformed into solid rock.\r\n\r\nThe finer portion of the sand of the river Nilus is not very different\r\nin its properties from the dust of Puteoli; not, indeed, that it is\r\nused for breaking the force of the sea and withstanding the waves,\r\nbut only for the purpose, forsooth, of subduing[2231] the body for\r\nthe exercises of the palestra! At all events, it was for this purpose\r\nthat it used to be brought over for Patrobius,[2232] a freedman of the\r\nEmperor Nero. I find it stated also, that Craterus, Leonnatus, and\r\nMeleager, generals of Alexander the Great, had this sand transported\r\nalong with their munitions of war. But I forbear to enlarge any further\r\nupon this subject; or indeed, by Hercules! upon those preparations of\r\nearth and wax of which the ceromata are made, so much employed by our\r\nyouth in their exercises of the body, at the cost of all vigour of the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48. (14.)—FORMACEAN WALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, besides, have we not in Africa and in Spain walls[2233] of\r\nearth, known as “formacean” walls? from the fact that they are moulded,\r\nrather than built, by enclosing earth within a frame of boards,\r\nconstructed on either side. These walls will last for centuries, are\r\nproof against rain, wind, and fire, and are superior in solidity to\r\nany cement. Even at this day, Spain still beholds watch-towers that\r\nwere erected by Hannibal, and turrets of earth[2234] placed on the\r\nvery summits of her mountains. It is from the same source, too, that\r\nwe derive the substantial materials so well adapted for forming the\r\nearth-works of our camps and embankments against the impetuous violence\r\nof rivers. What person, too, is unacquainted with the fact, that\r\npartitions are made of hurdles coated with clay, and that walls are\r\nconstructed of unbaked bricks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—WALLS OF BRICK. THE METHOD OF MAKING BRICKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarth for making bricks should never be extracted from a sandy or\r\ngravelly soil, and still less from one that is stony; but from a\r\nstratum that is white and cretaceous, or else impregnated with red\r\nearth.[2235] If a sandy soil must be employed for the purpose, it\r\nshould at least be male[2236] sand, and no other. The spring is the\r\nbest season for making bricks, as at midsummer they are very apt to\r\ncrack. For building, bricks two years old are the only ones that are\r\napproved of; and the wrought material of them should be well macerated\r\nbefore they are made.\r\n\r\nThere are three different kinds of bricks; the Lydian, which is in\r\nuse with us, a foot-and-a-half in length by a foot in breadth; the\r\ntetradoron; and the pentadoron; the word “doron” being used by the\r\nancient Greeks to signify the palm[2237]—hence, too, their word “doron”\r\nmeaning a gift, because it is the hand that gives.—These last two\r\nkinds, therefore, are named respectively from their being four and five\r\npalms in length, the breadth being the same. The smaller kind is used\r\nin Greece for private buildings, the larger for the construction of\r\npublic edifices. At Pitane,[2238] in Asia, and in the cities of Muxilua\r\nand Calentum in Farther Spain, there are bricks[2239] made, which\r\nfloat in water, when dry; the material being a sort of pumice-earth,\r\nextremely good for the purpose when it can be made to unite. The\r\nGreeks have always preferred walls of brick, except in those cases\r\nwhere they could find silicious stone for the purposes of building:\r\nfor walls of this nature will last for ever, if they are only built\r\non the perpendicular. Hence it is, that the Greeks have built their\r\npublic edifices and the palaces of their kings of brick; the wall at\r\nAthens, for example, which faces Mount Hymettus; the Temples of Jupiter\r\nand Hercules at Patræ,[2240] although the columns and architraves in\r\nthe interior are of stone; the palace of King Attalus at Tralles; the\r\npalace of Crœsus at Sardes, now converted into an asylum[2241] for aged\r\npersons; and that of King Mausolus at Halicarnassus; edifices, all of\r\nthem, still in existence.\r\n\r\nMuræna and Varro, in their ædileship, had a fine fresco painting, on\r\nthe plaster of a wall at Lacedæmon, cut away from the bricks, and\r\ntransported in wooden frames to Rome, for the purpose of adorning\r\nthe Comitium. Admirable as the work was of itself, it was still more\r\nadmired after being thus transferred. In Italy also there are walls of\r\nbrick, at Arretium and Mevania.[2242] At Rome, there are no buildings\r\nof this description, because a wall only a foot-and-a-half in thickness\r\nwould not support more than a single story; and by public ordinance it\r\nhas been enacted that no partition should exceed that thickness; nor,\r\nindeed, does the peculiar construction of our party-walls admit of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50. (15.)—SULPHUR, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT: FOURTEEN\r\nREMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet thus much be deemed sufficient on the subject of bricks. Among the\r\nother kinds of earth, the one of the most singular nature, perhaps,\r\nis sulphur, an agent of great power upon other substances. Sulphur\r\nis found in the Æolian Islands, between Sicily and Italy, which are\r\nvolcanic, as already[2243] stated. But the finest sulphur of all, is\r\nthat which comes from the Isle of Melos. It is obtained also in Italy,\r\nupon the range of hills in the territories of Neapolis and Campania,\r\nknown as the Leucogæi:[2244] when extracted from the mines there, it is\r\npurified by the agency of fire.\r\n\r\nThere are four kinds of sulphur; the first of which is “live” sulphur,\r\nknown as “apyron”[2245] by the Greeks, and found in solid masses, or\r\nin other words, in blocks. This, too, is the only sulphur that is\r\nextracted in its native state, the others being found in a state of\r\nliquescence, and requiring to be purified by being boiled in oil. This\r\nkind is green and transparent, and is the only sulphur that is used for\r\nmedicinal purposes. A second kind is known as the “glebaceous”[2246]\r\nsulphur, and is solely employed in the workshops of the fullers. The\r\nthird kind, also, is only used for a single purpose, that of fumigating\r\nwool, a process which contributes very greatly to making the wool white\r\nand soft; “egula”[2246] is the name given to it. The fourth kind is\r\nused in the preparation of matches more particularly.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these several uses, sulphur is of such remarkable\r\nvirtue, that if it is thrown upon the fire it will at once detect, by\r\nthe smell, whether or not a person is subject to epilepsy. Anaxilaüs\r\nused to employ this substance by way of pastime: putting sulphur in a\r\ncup of wine, with some hot coals beneath, he would hand it round to\r\nthe guests, the light given by it, while burning, throwing a ghastly\r\npaleness like that of death upon the face of each. Its properties are\r\ncalorific and maturative, in addition to which, it disperses abscesses\r\non the body: hence it is that it is used as an ingredient in plasters\r\nand emollient poultices. Applied to the loins and kidneys, with grease,\r\nwhen there are pains in those parts, it is marvellously effectual as\r\na remedy. In combination with turpentine, it removes lichens on the\r\nface, and leprosy,[2247] the preparation being known as “harpax,”[2248]\r\nfrom the celerity with which it acts upon the skin; for which reason\r\nit ought to be removed every now and then. Employed as an electuary,\r\nit is good for asthma, purulent expectorations, and stings inflicted\r\nby scorpions. Live sulphur, mixed with nitre, and then bruised with\r\nvinegar and applied, causes morphew to disappear, and destroys nits in\r\nthe hair; in combination, too, with sandarach and vinegar, it is good\r\nfor diseases of the eyelids.\r\n\r\nSulphur has its place among our religious ceremonies, being used as\r\na fumigation for purifying houses.[2249] Its virtues are also to\r\nbe perceived in certain hot mineral waters;[2250] and there is no\r\nsubstance that ignites more readily, a proof that there is in it\r\na great affinity to fire. Lightning and thunder are attended with\r\na strong smell of sulphur, and the light produced by them is of a\r\nsulphureous complexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—BITUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT; TWENTY-SEVEN\r\nREMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly approaching to the nature of sulphur is that of bitumen,[2251]\r\nwhich in some places assumes the form of a slime, and in others that\r\nof an earth; a slime, thrown up, as already[2252] stated, by a certain\r\nlake in Judæa, and an earth, found in the vicinity of Sidon, a maritime\r\ntown of Syria. In both these states, it admits of being thickened and\r\ncondensed. There is also a liquid[2253] bitumen, that of Zacynthus,\r\nfor example, and the bitumen that is imported from Babylon; which last\r\nkind is also white: the bitumen, too, of Apollonia is liquid. All these\r\nkinds, in Greek, have the one general name of “pissasphaltos,”[2254]\r\nfrom their strong resemblance to a compound of pitch and bitumen. There\r\nis also found an unctuous liquid bitumen, resembling oil, in a spring\r\nat Agrigentum, in Sicily, the waters of which are tainted by it. The\r\ninhabitants of the spot collect it on the panicles of reeds, to which\r\nit very readily adheres, and make use of it for burning in lamps, as\r\na substitute for oil, as also for the cure of itch-scab in beasts of\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nSome authorities include among the bitumens, naphtha, a substance which\r\nwe have already mentioned in the Second Book;[2255] but the burning\r\nproperties which it possesses, and its susceptibility of igniting,\r\nrender it quite unfit for use. Bitumen, to be of good quality,\r\nshould be extremely brilliant, heavy, and massive; it should also\r\nbe moderately smooth, it being very much the practice to adulterate\r\nit with pitch. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of\r\nsulphur, it being naturally astringent, dispersive, contractive,\r\nand agglutinating: ignited, it drives away serpents by the smell.\r\nBabylonian bitumen is very efficacious, it is said, for the cure of\r\ncataract and albugo, as also of leprosy, lichens, and pruriginous\r\naffections. Bitumen is employed, too, in the form of a liniment, for\r\ngout; and every variety of it is useful for making bandolines for\r\neye-lashes that are refractory and impede the sight. Applied topically\r\nwith nitre,[2256] it is curative of tooth-ache, and, taken internally,\r\nwith wine, it alleviates chronic coughs and difficulty of respiration.\r\nIt is administered in a similar manner for dysentery, and is very good\r\nfor arresting looseness of the bowels. Taken internally with vinegar,\r\nit dissolves and brings away coagulated blood. It modifies pains also\r\nin the loins and joints, and, applied with barley-meal, it forms a\r\npeculiar kind of plaster, to which it has given its name.[2257] It\r\nstanches blood also, heals wounds, and unites the sinews when severed.\r\nBitumen is administered for quartan fevers, in doses of one drachma\r\nto an equal quantity of hedyosmos,[2258] the whole kneaded up with\r\none obolus of myrrh. The smell of burnt bitumen detects a tendency to\r\nepilepsy, and, applied to the nostrils with wine and castoreum,[2259]\r\nit dispels suffocations of the uterus. Employed as a fumigation, it\r\nacts as a check upon procidence of the uterus, and, taken internally\r\nwith wine, it has the effect of an emmenagogue.\r\n\r\nAnother use that is made of it, is for coating the inside of copper\r\nvessels, it rendering them proof against the action of fire. It has\r\nbeen already[2260] stated that bitumen was formerly employed for\r\nstaining copper and coating statues. It has been used, too, as a\r\nsubstitute for lime; the walls of Babylon, for instance, which are\r\ncemented with it. In the smithies they are in the habit of varnishing\r\niron and heads of nails with it, and of using it for many other\r\npurposes as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—ALUMEN, AND THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT; THIRTY-EIGHT\r\nREMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot less important, or indeed very dissimilar, are the uses that are\r\nmade of alumen;[2261] by which name is understood a sort of brine[2262]\r\nwhich exudes from the earth. Of this, too, there are several kinds. In\r\nCyprus there is a white alumen, and another kind of a darker colour.\r\nThe difference, however, in their colour is but trifling in reality,\r\nthough the uses made of them are very dissimilar; the white liquid\r\nalumen being employed for dyeing[2263] wool of bright colours, and the\r\nblack, on the other hand, for giving wool a tawny or a sombre tint.\r\nGold, too, is purified[2264] by the agency of black alumen. Every kind\r\nof alumen is a compound of slime and water, or in other words, is a\r\nliquid product exuding from the earth; the concretion of it commencing\r\nin winter, and being completed by the action of the summer sun. That\r\nportion of it which is the first matured, is the whitest in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe countries which produce this substance, are Spain, Ægypt, Armenia,\r\nMacedonia, Pontus, Africa,[2265] and the islands of Sardinia, Melos,\r\nLipara, and Strongyle:[2266] the most esteemed, however, is that of\r\nEgypt,[2267] the next best being the produce of Melos. Of this last\r\nkind there are also two varieties, the liquid alumen, and the solid.\r\nLiquid alumen, to be good, should be of a limpid, milky, appearance:\r\nwhen rubbed between the fingers it should be free from grit, and\r\nproductive of a slight sensation of heat. The name given to it is\r\n“phorimon.”[2268] The mode of detecting whether or not it has been\r\nadulterated, is by the application of pomegranate-juice; for if\r\ngenuine, it will turn black on combining with the juice. The other, or\r\nsolid alumen, is pale and rough in appearance, and turns black on the\r\napplication of nut-galls; for which reason it is known by the name of\r\n“paraphoron.”[2269]\r\n\r\nLiquid alumen is naturally astringent, indurative, and corrosive: used\r\nin combination with honey, it heals ulcerations of the mouth, pimples,\r\nand pruriginous eruptions. The remedy, when thus used, is employed in\r\nthe bath, the proportions being two parts of honey to one of alumen.\r\nIt has the effect, also, of checking and dispersing perspiration, and\r\nof neutralizing offensive odours of the arm-pits. It is taken too, in\r\nthe form of pills, for affections of the spleen, and for the purpose\r\nof carrying off blood by the urine: incorporated with nitre and\r\nmelanthium,[2270] it is curative of itch-scab.\r\n\r\nThere is one kind of solid alumen, known to the Greeks as\r\n“schiston,”[2271] which splits into filaments of a whitish colour;\r\nfor which reason some have preferred giving it the name of\r\n“trichitis.”[2272] It is produced from the mineral ore known to us\r\nas “chalcitis,”[2273] from which copper is also produced, it being a\r\nsort of exudation from that mineral, coagulated into the form of scum.\r\nThis kind of alumen is less desiccative than the others, and is not so\r\nuseful as a check upon bad humours of the body. Used, however, either\r\nin the form of a liniment or of an injection, it is highly beneficial\r\nto the ears; as also for ulcerations of the mouth, and for tooth-ache,\r\nif retained with the saliva in the mouth. It is employed also as a\r\nserviceable ingredient in compositions for the eyes, and for the\r\ngenerative organs in either sex. The mode of preparing it is to roast\r\nit in crucibles, until it has quite lost its liquid form.\r\n\r\nThere is another variety of alumen also, of a less active nature, and\r\nknown as “strongyle;”[2274] which is again subdivided into two kinds;\r\nthe fungous, which easily dissolves in any liquid, and is looked\r\nupon as altogether worthless; and the porous, which is full of small\r\nholes like a sponge, and in pieces of a globular form, more nearly\r\napproaching white alumen in appearance. It has a certain degree, too,\r\nof unctuousness, is free from grit, friable, and not apt to blacken\r\nthe fingers. This last kind is calcined by itself upon hot coals,\r\nunmixed with any other substance, until it is entirely reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\nThe best kind of all, however, is that called “molinum,”[2275] as\r\ncoming from the Isle of Melos, as already mentioned; none being more\r\neffectual for acting as an astringent, staining black, and indurating,\r\nand none assuming a closer consistency. It removes granulations of\r\nthe eye-lids, and, in a calcined state, is still more efficacious for\r\nchecking defluxions of the eyes: in this last form, too, it is employed\r\nfor the cure of pruriginous eruptions on the body. Whether taken\r\ninternally, or employed externally, it arrests discharges of blood; and\r\nif it is applied with vinegar to a part from which the hair has been\r\nfirst removed, it will change into a soft down the hair which replaces\r\nit. The leading property of every kind of alumen is its remarkable\r\nastringency, to which, in fact, it is indebted for its name[2276] with\r\nthe Greeks. It is for this property that the various kinds are, all of\r\nthem, so remarkably good for the eyes. In combination with grease, they\r\narrest discharges of blood; and they are employed in a similar manner\r\nfor checking the spread of putrid ulcers, and for removing sores upon\r\nthe bodies of infants.\r\n\r\nAlumen has a desiccative effect upon dropsical eruptions; and, in\r\ncombination with pomegranate juice, it removes diseases of the ears,\r\nmalformed nails, indurations resulting from cicatrization, hangnails,\r\nand chilblains. Calcined, with vinegar or nut-galls, in equal\r\nproportions, it is curative of phagedænic ulcers; and, in combination\r\nwith extracted juice of cabbage, of leprosy. Used in the proportion\r\nof one part of alumen to two of salt, it arrests the progress of\r\nserpiginous eruptions; and an infusion of it in water destroys lice and\r\nother parasitical insects that infest the hair. Employed in a similar\r\nmanner, it is good for burns; and, in combination with the serous[2277]\r\npart of pitch, for furfuraceous eruptions on the body. It is used also\r\nas an injection for dysentery, and, employed in the form of a gargle,\r\nit braces the uvula and tonsillary glands. For all those maladies which\r\nwe have mentioned as being treated with the other kinds of alumen,\r\nthat imported from Melos, be it understood, is still more efficacious.\r\nAs to the other uses that are made of it for industrial purposes, such\r\nas preparing hides and wool, for example, they have been mentioned\r\nalready.[2278]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53. (16.)—SAMIAN EARTH: THREE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn succession to these, we shall now have to speak of various other\r\nkinds of earth[2279] which are made use of in medicine.\r\n\r\nOf Samian earth there are two varieties; one known as\r\n“collyrium,”[2280] the other by the name of “aster.”[2281] To be in\r\nperfection, the first kind should be fresh, remarkably smooth, and\r\nglutinous to the tongue; the second being of a more solid consistency,\r\nand white. They are both prepared for use by being calcined and then\r\nrinsed in water, some persons giving the preference to the first. They\r\nare both of them useful for discharges of blood from the mouth, and are\r\nemployed as an ingredient in plasters of a desiccative nature. They are\r\nused also in the preparation of ophthalmic compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF ERETRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf eretria, or Eretrian[2282] earth, there are also the same number\r\nof varieties; one white, and the other of an ashy colour, this last\r\nbeing preferred in medicine. To be good, this earth should be of a soft\r\nconsistency, and when rubbed upon copper it should leave a violet tint.\r\nThe virtues of eretria in a medicinal point of view, and the methods of\r\nusing it, have been already mentioned[2283] in our description of the\r\npigments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—THE METHOD OF WASHING EARTHS FOR MEDICINAL PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these earths—for we will take the present opportunity of mentioning\r\nit—are well washed in water, and then dried in the sun; after which,\r\nthey are again triturated in water, and left to settle: this done, they\r\nare divided into tablets. They are usually boiled in earthen vessels,\r\nwhich are well shaken every now and then.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—CHIAN EARTH; THREE REMEDIES. SELINUSIAN EARTH; THREE\r\nREMEDIES. PNIGITIS; NINE REMEDIES. AMPELITIS; FOUR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the medicinal substances, there is the white earth of Chios\r\nalso, the properties of which are the same as those of Samian earth.\r\nIt is used more particularly as a cosmetic for the skin of females;\r\nthe Selinusian[2284] earth being also employed for a similar purpose.\r\nThis last is of a milk-white colour, and melts very rapidly in water:\r\ndissolved in milk, it is employed for whitening the plaster coats on\r\nwalls. Pnigitis[2285] is very similar to Eretrian earth, only that\r\nit is found in larger masses, and is of a glutinous consistency. Its\r\neffects are similar to those produced by Cimolian[2286] earth, but are\r\nnot so energetic.\r\n\r\nAmpelitis[2287] is an earth which bears a strong resemblance to\r\nbitumen. The test of its goodness is its dissolving in oil, like wax,\r\nand preserving its black colour when submitted to the action of fire.\r\nIts properties are emollient and repercussive; for which reason, it is\r\nused in medicinal compositions, those known as “calliblephara,”[2288]\r\nmore particularly, and in preparations for dyeing the hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (17.)—CRETACEOUS EARTHS USER FOR SCOURING CLOTH. CIMOLIAN\r\nEARTH; NINE REMEDIES. SARDINIAN EARTH. UMBRIAN EARTH. SAXUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf cretaceous[2289] earths there are several varieties; and among\r\nthem, two kinds of Cimolian earth, employed in medicine, the one white\r\nand the other inclining to the tint of purpurissum.[2290] Both kinds,\r\nmoistened with vinegar, have the effect of dispersing tumours and\r\narresting defluxions. They are curative also of inflammatory swellings\r\nand imposthumes of the parotid glands; and, applied topically, they\r\nare good for affections of the spleen and pustules on the body. With\r\nthe addition of aphronitrum,[2291] oil of cypros,[2292] and vinegar,\r\nthey reduce swellings of the feet, care being taken to apply the lotion\r\nin the sun, and at the end of six hours to wash it off with salt and\r\nwater. In combination with wax and oil of cypros, Cimolian earth is\r\ngood for swellings of the testes.\r\n\r\nCretaceous earths, too, are of a cooling tendency, and, applied to the\r\nbody in the form of a liniment, they act as a check upon excessive\r\nperspiration: taken with wine, in the bath, they remove pimples on the\r\nbody. The most esteemed of all these earths is that of Thessaly: it is\r\nfound also in the vicinity of Bubon[2293] in Lycia.\r\n\r\nCimolian earth is used also for another purpose, that of scouring\r\ncloth. As to the kind which is brought from Sardinia, and is known as\r\n“sarda,” it is used for white tissues only, and is never employed for\r\ncoloured cloths. Indeed, this last is held in the lowest estimation\r\nof all the Cimolian earths; whereas, that of Umbria is more highly\r\nesteemed, as also the kind generally known as “saxum.”[2294] It is a\r\nproperty of this last to increase in weight[2295] by maceration, and\r\nit is by weight that it is usually sold, Sardinian earth being sold by\r\nmeasure. Umbrian earth is only used for giving lustre to cloths.\r\n\r\nIt will not be deemed out of place to give some further account here\r\nof this process, there being still in existence the Metilian Law,\r\nrelative to fullers; an enactment which C. Flaminius and L. Æmilius, in\r\ntheir censorship,[2296] had passed by the people,[2297] so attentive\r\nto everything were our ancestors. The following then is the method\r\nemployed in preparing cloth: it is first washed in an infusion of\r\nSardinian earth, and is then exposed to a fumigation with sulphur. This\r\ndone, it is scoured[2298] with Cimolian earth, when the cloth has been\r\nfound to be of a genuine colour; it being very soon detected when it\r\nhas been coloured with spurious materials, by its turning black and the\r\ncolours becoming dispersed[2299] by the action of the sulphur. Where\r\nthe colours are genuine and rich, they are softened by the application\r\nof Cimolian earth; which brightens and freshens them also when they\r\nhave been rendered sombre by the action of the sulphur. Saxum is better\r\nfor white tissues, after the application of sulphur, but to coloured\r\ncloths it is highly injurious.[2300] In Greece they use Tymphæan[2301]\r\ngypsum in place of Cimolian earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—ARGENTARIA. NAMES OF FREEDMEN WHO HAVE EITHER RISEN TO POWER\r\nTHEMSELVES, OR HAVE BELONGED TO MEN OF INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another cretaceous earth, known as “argentaria,”[2302] from\r\nthe brightness[2303] which it imparts to silver. There is also the most\r\ninferior kind of chalk; which was used by the ancients for tracing the\r\nline of victory[2304] in the Circus, and for marking the feet of slaves\r\non sale, that were brought from beyond sea. Such, for instance, were\r\nPublilius[2305] Lochius, the founder of our mimic scenes; his cousin,\r\nManilius Antiochus,[2306] the first cultivator of astronomy; and\r\nStaberius Eros, our first grammarian; all three of whom our ancestors\r\nsaw brought over in the same ship.[2307]\r\n\r\n(18.) But why mention these names, recommended as they are by the\r\nliterary honours which they acquired? Other instances too, Rome has\r\nbeheld of persons rising to high positions from the slave-market;[2308]\r\nChrysogonus, for example, the freedman of Sylla; Amphion, the freedman\r\nof Q. Catulus; the man who was the keeper[2309] of Lucullus; Demetrius,\r\nthe freedman of Pompeius, and Auge, the freedwoman of Demetrius,[2310]\r\nor else of Pompeius himself, as some have supposed; Hipparchus, the\r\nfreedman of M. Antonius; as also, Menas[2311] and Menecrates,[2312]\r\nfreedmen of Sextus Pompeius, and many others as well, whom it would be\r\nsuperfluous to enumerate, and who have enriched themselves at the cost\r\nof Roman blood, and the licence that results from proscription.\r\n\r\nSuch is the mark that is set upon those droves of slaves which we see\r\non sale, such the opprobrium thrown upon them by a capricious fortune!\r\nAnd yet, some of these very men have we beheld in the enjoyment of\r\nsuch power and influence, that the senate itself has decreed them—at\r\nthe command of Agrippina,[2313] wife of the Emperor Claudius—the\r\ndecorations even of the prætorship: all but honoured with the fasces\r\nand their laurels, in fact, and sent back in state to the very place\r\nfrom which they originally came, with their feet whitened with the\r\nslave-dealer’s chalk!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59. (19.)—THE EARTH OF GALATA; OF CLYPEA; OF THE BALEARES; AND OF\r\nEBUSUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there are various other kinds of earth, endowed\r\nwith peculiar properties of their own, and which have been already\r\nmentioned on former occasions.[2314] We may, however, take the present\r\nopportunity of again remarking the following properties. The earth of\r\nthe island of Galata and of the vicinity of Clypea, in Africa, is fatal\r\nto scorpions; and that of the Balearic Islands and of Ebusus kills\r\nserpents.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remedies, narratives, and observations, nine hundred and\r\nfifty-six.\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Messala[2315] the Orator, the Elder\r\nMessala,[2316] Fenestella,[2317] Atticus,[2318] M. Varro,[2319]\r\nVerrius,[2320] Cornelius Nepos,[2321] Deculo,[2322] Mucianus,[2323]\r\nMelissus,[2324] Vitruvius,[2325] Cassius Severus Longulanus,[2326]\r\nFabius Vestalis,[2327] who wrote on Painting.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AUTHORS QUOTED.—Pasiteles,[2328] Apelles,[2329]\r\nMelanthius,[2330] Asclepiodorus,[2331] Euphranor,[2332]\r\nHeliodorus,[2333] who wrote on the Votive Offerings of the Athenians,\r\nMetrodorus,[2334] who wrote on Architecture, Democritus,[2335]\r\nTheophrastus,[2336] Apion[2337] the grammarian, who wrote on the\r\nMedicines derived from Metals, Nymphodorus,[2338] Iollas,[2339]\r\nApollodorus,[2340] Andreas,[2341] Heraclides,[2342] Diagoras,[2343]\r\nBotrys,[2344] Archidemus,[2345] Dionysius,[2346] Aristogenes,[2347]\r\nDemocles,[2348] Mnesides,[2349] Xenocrates[2350] the son of Zeno,\r\nTheomnestus.[2351]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 1. (1.)—LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF VARIOUS KINDS OF MARBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt now remains for us to speak of stones, or, in other words, the\r\nleading folly of the day; to say nothing at all of our taste for gems\r\nand amber, crystal and murrhine vases.[2352] For everything of which\r\nwe have previously treated, down to the present Book, may, by some\r\npossibility or other, have the appearance of having been created for\r\nthe sake of man: but as to the mountains, Nature has made those for\r\nherself, as a kind of bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the\r\nearth; as also for the purpose of curbing the violence of the rivers,\r\nof breaking the waves of the sea, and so, by opposing to them the very\r\nhardest of her materials, putting a check upon those elements which\r\nare never at rest. And yet we must hew down these mountains, forsooth,\r\nand carry them off; and this, for no other reason than to gratify our\r\nluxurious inclinations: heights which in former days it was reckoned a\r\nmiracle even to have crossed!\r\n\r\nOur forefathers regarded as a prodigy the passage of the Alps, first by\r\nHannibal,[2353] and, more recently, by the Cimbri: but at the present\r\nday, these very mountains are cut asunder to yield us a thousand\r\ndifferent marbles, promontories are thrown open to the sea, and the\r\nface of Nature is being everywhere reduced to a level. We now carry\r\naway the barriers that were destined for the separation of one nation\r\nfrom another; we construct ships for the transport of our marbles;\r\nand, amid the waves, the most boisterous element of Nature, we convey\r\nthe summits of the mountains to and fro: a thing, however, that is\r\neven less unpardonable than to go on the search amid the regions of\r\nthe clouds for vessels[2354] with which to cool our draughts, and to\r\nexcavate rocks, towering to the very heavens, in order that we may\r\nhave the satisfaction of drinking from ice! Let each reflect, when he\r\nhears of the high prices set upon these things, when he sees these\r\nponderous masses carted and carried away, how many there are whose life\r\nis passed far more happily without them. For what utility or for what\r\nso-called pleasure do mortals make themselves the agents, or, more\r\ntruly speaking, the victims of such undertakings, except in order that\r\nothers may take their repose in the midst of variegated stones? Just as\r\nthough too, the shades of night, which occupy one half of each man’s\r\nexistence, would forbear to curtail these imaginary delights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—WHO WAS THE FIRST TO EMPLOY MARBLE IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, while making these reflections, one cannot but feel ashamed\r\nof the men of ancient times even. There are still in existence\r\ncensorial[2355] laws, which forbid the kernels[2356] in the neck of\r\nswine to be served at table, dormice too, and other things too trifling\r\nto mention: and yet there has been no law passed, forbidding marble to\r\nbe imported, or the seas to be traversed in search of it!\r\n\r\n(2.) It may possibly be observed, that this was, because marble was not\r\nthen introduced. Such, however, is not the fact; for in the ædileship\r\nof M. Scaurus,[2357] three hundred and sixty columns were to be seen\r\nimported; for the decorations of a temporary theatre, too, one that was\r\ndestined to be in use for barely a single month. And yet the laws were\r\nsilent thereon; in a spirit of indulgence for the amusements of the\r\npublic, no doubt. But then, why such indulgence or how do vices more\r\ninsidiously steal upon us than under the plea of serving the public? By\r\nwhat other way, in fact, did ivory, gold, and precious stones, first\r\ncome into use with private individuals?\r\n\r\nCan we say that there is now anything that we have reserved for the\r\nexclusive use of the gods? However, be it so, let us admit of this\r\nindulgence for the amusements of the public; but still, why did the\r\nlaws maintain their silence when the largest of these columns, pillars\r\nof Lucullan[2358] marble, as much as eight-and-thirty feet in height,\r\nwere erected in the atrium of Scaurus? a thing, too, that was not\r\ndone privately or in secret; for the contractor for the public sewers\r\ncompelled him to give security for the possible damage that might be\r\ndone in the carriage of them to the Palatium.[2359] When so bad an\r\nexample as this was set, would it not have been advisable to take some\r\nprecautions for the preservation of the public morals? And yet the laws\r\nstill preserved their silence, when such enormous masses as these were\r\nbeing carried past the earthenware[2360] pediments of the temples of\r\nthe gods, to the house of a private individual!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3. (3.)—WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ERECT COLUMNS OF FOREIGN MARBLE AT\r\nROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd yet it cannot be said that Scaurus, by way of a first essay in\r\nvice, took the City by surprise, in a state of ignorance and totally\r\nunguarded against such evils as these. Already had L. Crassus,[2361]\r\nthe orator, he who was the first to possess pillars of foreign marble,\r\nand in this same Palatium too, received from M. Brutus, on the occasion\r\nof a dispute, the nickname of the “Palatine Venus,” for his indulgence\r\nin this kind of luxury. The material, I should remark, was Hymettian\r\nmarble, and the pillars were but six in number, and not exceeding some\r\ntwelve feet in height. Our forefathers were guilty of this omission,\r\nno doubt, because morals were universally contaminated; and, seeing\r\nthat things which had been interdicted had been forbidden in vain, they\r\npreferred the absence of laws to laws that were no better than a dead\r\nletter. These particulars and others in the sequel will show that we\r\nare so far improved; for who is there at the present day that has, in\r\nhis atrium, any such massive columns as these of Scaurus?\r\n\r\nBut before proceeding to treat of the several varieties of this\r\nmaterial, it will be as well to mention the various artists, and the\r\ndegrees of estimation in which they are held, who have worked in\r\nmarble. We will, therefore, proceed to review the sculptors who have\r\nflourished at different periods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4. (4.)—THE FIRST ARTISTS WHO EXCELLED IN THE SCULPTURE OF\r\nMARBLE, AND THE VARIOUS PERIODS AT WHICH THEY FLOURISHED. THE MAUSOLEUM\r\nIN CARIA. THE MOST CELEBRATED SCULPTORS AND WORKS IN MARBLE, TWO\r\nHUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE IN NUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first artists who distinguished themselves in the sculpture of\r\nmarble, were Dipœnus[2362] and Scyllis, natives of the Isle of Crete.\r\nAt this period the Medians were still in power, and Cyrus had not begun\r\nto reign in Persia; their date being about the fiftieth Olympiad.\r\nThey afterwards repaired to Sicyon, a state which for a length of\r\ntime[2363] was the adopted country of all such pursuits as these.\r\nThe people of Sicyon had made a contract with them for the execution\r\nof certain statues of the gods; but, before completing the work, the\r\nartists complained of some injustice being done them, and retired to\r\nÆtolia. Immediately upon this, the state was afflicted with sterility\r\nand famine, and dreadful consternation was the result. Upon enquiry\r\nbeing made as to a remedy for these evils, the Pythian Apollo made\r\nanswer, that Dipœnus and Scyllis must complete the statues of the gods;\r\nan object which was attained at the cost of great concessions and\r\nconsiderable sums of money. The statues were those of Apollo,[2364]\r\nDiana, Hercules, and Minerva; the last of which was afterwards struck\r\nby lightning.\r\n\r\n(5.) Before these artists were in existence, there had already appeared\r\nMelas, a sculptor of the Isle of Chios; and, in succession to him, his\r\nson Micciades, and his grandson Archermus;[2365] whose sons, Bupalus\r\nand Athenis, afterwards attained the highest eminence in the art.\r\nThese last were contemporaries of the poet Hipponax, who, it is well\r\nknown, lived in the sixtieth Olympiad. Now, if a person only reckons,\r\ngoing upwards from their time to that of their great-grandfather, he\r\nwill find that the art of sculpture must have necessarily originated\r\nabout the commencement of the era of the Olympiads. Hipponax being a\r\nman notorious for his ugliness, the two artists, by way of joke,[2366]\r\nexhibited a statue of him for the ridicule of the public. Indignant at\r\nthis, the poet emptied upon them all the bitterness of his verses; to\r\nsuch an extent indeed, that, as some believe, they were driven to hang\r\nthemselves in despair. This, however, is not the fact; for, at a later\r\nperiod, these artists executed a number of statues in the neighbouring\r\nislands; at Delos for example, with an inscription subjoined to the\r\neffect, that Chios was rendered famous not only by its vines[2367]\r\nbut by the works of the sons of Archermus as well. The people of\r\nLasos[2368] still show a Diana that was made by them; and we find\r\nmention also made of a Diana at Chios, the work of their hands: it is\r\nerected on an elevated spot, and the features appear stern to a person\r\nas he enters, and joyous as he departs. At Rome, there are some statues\r\nby these artists on the summit of the Temple[2369] of the Palatine\r\nApollo, and, indeed, in most of the buildings that were erected by the\r\nlate Emperor Augustus. At Delos and in the Isle of Lesbos there were\r\nformerly some sculptures by their father to be seen. Ambracia too,\r\nArgos, and Cleonæ, were filled with productions of the sculptor Dipœnus.\r\n\r\nAll these artists, however, used nothing but the white marble\r\nof the Isle of Paros, a stone which was known as “lychnites” at\r\nfirst, because, according to Varro, it was cut in the quarries by\r\nlamplight.[2370] Since their time, many other whiter marbles have been\r\ndiscovered, and very recently that of the quarries of Luna.[2371]\r\nWith reference to the marble of Paros, there is one very marvellous\r\ncircumstance related; in a single block that was split with wedges, a\r\nfigure[2372] of Silenus made its appearance.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to remark, that the art of sculpture is of much more\r\nancient[2373] date than those of painting and of statuary in bronze;\r\nboth of which commenced with Phidias, in the eighty-third Olympiad,\r\nor in other words, about three hundred and thirty-two years later.\r\nIndeed, it is said, that Phidias himself worked in marble, and that\r\nthere is a Venus of his at Rome, a work of extraordinary beauty, in\r\nthe buildings of Octavia.[2374] A thing, however, that is universally\r\nadmitted, is the fact that he was the instructor of Alcamenes,[2375]\r\nthe Athenian, one of the most famous among the sculptors. By this\r\nlast artist, there are numerous statues in the temples at Athens; as\r\nalso, without the walls there, the celebrated Venus, known as the\r\nAphrodite ἐν κήποις,[2376] work to which Phidias himself,\r\nit is said, put the finishing hand. Another disciple also of Phidias\r\nwas Agoracritus[2377] of Paros, a great favourite with his master, on\r\naccount of his extremely youthful age; and for which reason, it is\r\nsaid, Phidias gave his own name to many of that artist’s works. The two\r\npupils entering into a contest as to the superior execution of a statue\r\nof Venus, Alcamenes was successful; not that his work was superior,\r\nbut because his fellow-citizens chose to give their suffrages in his\r\nfavour in preference to a stranger. It was for this reason, it is\r\nsaid, that Agoracritus sold his statue, on the express condition that\r\nit should never be taken to Athens, and changed its name to that of\r\nNemesis.[2378] It was accordingly erected at Rhamnus,[2379] a borough\r\nof Attica, and M. Varro has considered it superior to every other\r\nstatue. There is also to be seen in the Temple of the Great Mother, in\r\nthe same city, another work[2380] by Agoracritus.\r\n\r\nAmong all nations which the fame of the Olympian Jupiter has reached,\r\nPhidias is looked upon, beyond all doubt, as the most famous of\r\nartists: but to let those who have never even seen his works, know how\r\ndeservedly he is esteemed, we will take this opportunity of adducing\r\na few slight proofs of the genius which he displayed. In doing this,\r\nwe shall not appeal to the beauty of his Olympian Jupiter, nor yet to\r\nthe vast proportions of his Athenian Minerva, six and twenty cubits in\r\nheight, and composed of ivory and gold; but it is to the shield of this\r\nlast statue that we shall draw attention; upon the convex face of which\r\nhe has chased a combat of the Amazons, while, upon the concave side\r\nof it, he has represented the battle between the Gods and the Giants.\r\nUpon the sandals again, we see the wars of the Lapithæ and Centaurs,\r\nso careful has he been to fill every smallest portion of his work with\r\nsome proof or other of his artistic skill. To the story chased upon\r\nthe pedestal of the statue, the name of the “Birth of Pandora”[2381]\r\nhas been given; and the figures of new-born[2382] gods to be seen\r\nupon it are no less than twenty in number. The figure of Victory, in\r\nparticular, is most admirable, and connoisseurs are greatly struck with\r\nthe serpent and the sphinx in bronze lying beneath the point of the\r\nspear. Let thus much be said incidentally in reference to an artist who\r\ncan never be sufficiently praised; if only to let it be understood that\r\nthe richness of his genius was always equal to itself, even in the very\r\nsmallest details.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking[2383] of the statuaries, we have already given the period\r\nat which Praxiteles flourished; an artist, who, in the glory which he\r\nacquired by his works in marble, surpassed even himself. There are\r\nsome works of his in the Ceramicus[2384] at Athens; but, superior to\r\nall the statues, not only of Praxiteles, but of any other artist that\r\never existed, is his Cnidian Venus; for the inspection of which, many\r\npersons before now have purposely undertaken a voyage to Cnidos. The\r\nartist made two statues of the goddess, and offered them both for sale:\r\none of them was represented with drapery,[2385] and for this reason was\r\npreferred[2386] by the people of Cos, who had the choice; the second\r\nwas offered them at the same price, but, on the grounds of propriety\r\nand modesty, they thought fit to choose the other. Upon this, the\r\nCnidians purchased the rejected statue,[2387] and immensely superior\r\nhas it always been held in general estimation. At a later period, King\r\nNicomedes wished to purchase this statue of the Cnidians, and made\r\nthem an offer to pay off the whole of their public debt, which was\r\nvery large. They preferred, however, to submit to any extremity rather\r\nthan part with it; and with good reason, for by this statue Praxiteles\r\nhas perpetuated the glory of Cnidos. The little temple in which it is\r\nplaced is open on all sides, so that the beauties[2388] of the statue\r\nadmit of being seen from every point of view; an arrangement which\r\nwas favoured by the goddess herself, it is generally believed. Indeed,\r\nfrom whatever point it is viewed, its execution is equally worthy of\r\nadmiration. A certain individual, it is said, became enamoured of\r\nthis statue, and, concealing himself in the temple during the night,\r\ngratified his lustful passion upon it, traces of which are to be seen\r\nin a stain left upon the marble.[2389]\r\n\r\nThere are also at Cnidos some other statues in marble, the productions\r\nof illustrious artists; a Father Liber[2390] by Bryaxis,[2391] another\r\nby Scopas,[2392] and a Minerva by the same hand: indeed, there is no\r\ngreater proof of the supreme excellence of the Venus of Praxiteles\r\nthan the fact that, amid such productions as these, it is the only one\r\nthat we generally find noticed. By Praxiteles, too, there is a Cupid,\r\na statue which occasioned[2393] one of the charges brought by Cicero\r\nagainst Verres, and for the sake of seeing which persons used to visit\r\nThespiæ: at the present day, it is to be seen in the Schools[2394]\r\nof Octavia. By the same artist there is also another Cupid, without\r\ndrapery, at Parium, a colony of the Propontis; equal to the Cnidian\r\nVenus in the fineness of its execution, and said to have been the\r\nobject of a similar outrage. For one Alcetas, a Rhodian, becoming\r\ndeeply enamoured of it, left upon the marble similar traces of the\r\nviolence of his passion.\r\n\r\nAt Rome there are, by Praxiteles, a Flora, a Triptolemus, and a Ceres,\r\nin the Gardens of Servilius; statues of Good Success[2395] and Good\r\nFortune, in the Capitol; as also some Mænades,[2396] and figures known\r\nas Thyiades[2397] and Caryatides;[2398] some Sileni,[2399] to be seen\r\nin the memorial buildings of Asinius Pollio, and statues of Apollo and\r\nNeptune.\r\n\r\nCephisodotus,[2400] the son of Praxiteles, inherited his father’s\r\ntalent. There is, by him, at Pergamus, a splendid Group[2401] of\r\nWrestlers, a work that has been highly praised, and in which the\r\nfingers have all the appearance of being impressed upon real flesh\r\nrather than upon marble. At Rome there are by him, a Latona, in the\r\nTemple of the Palatium; a Venus, in the buildings that are memorials of\r\nAsinius Pollio; and an Æsculapius, and a Diana, in the Temple of Juno\r\nsituate within the Porticos of Octavia.\r\n\r\nScopas[2402] rivals these artists in fame: there are by him, a\r\nVenus[2403] and a Pothos,[2404] statues which are venerated at\r\nSamothrace with the most august ceremonials. He was also the sculptor\r\nof the Palatine Apollo; a Vesta seated, in the Gardens of Servilius,\r\nand represented with two Bends[2405] around her, a work that has been\r\nhighly praised; two similar Bends, to be seen upon the buildings of\r\nAsinius Pollio; and some figures of Canephori[2406] in the same place.\r\nBut the most highly esteemed of all his works, are those in the Temple\r\nerected by Cneius Domitius,[2407] in the Flaminian Circus; a figure of\r\nNeptune himself, a Thetis and Achilles, Nereids seated upon dolphins,\r\ncetaceous fishes, and[2408] sea-horses,[2409] Tritons, the train of\r\nPhorcus,[2410] whales,[2411] and numerous other sea-monsters, all by\r\nthe same hand; an admirable piece of workmanship, even if it had taken\r\na whole life to complete it. In addition to the works by him already\r\nmentioned, and others of the existence of which we are ignorant, there\r\nis still to be seen a colossal Mars of his, seated, in the Temple\r\nerected by Brutus Callæcus,[2412] also in the Flaminian Circus; as\r\nalso, a naked Venus, of anterior date to that by Praxiteles, and a\r\nproduction that would be quite sufficient to establish the renown of\r\nany other place.\r\n\r\nAt Rome, it is true, it is quite lost sight of amid such a vast\r\nmultitude of similar works of art: and then besides, the inattention\r\nto these matters that is induced by such vast numbers of duties and so\r\nmany items of business, quite precludes the generality of persons from\r\ndevoting their thoughts to the subject. For, in fact, the admiration\r\nthat is due to this art, not only demands an abundance of leisure, but\r\nrequires that profound silence should reign upon the spot. Hence it\r\nis, that the artist is now forgotten, who executed the statue of Venus\r\nthat was dedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus in his Temple of Peace, a\r\nwork well worthy of the high repute of ancient times. With reference,\r\ntoo, to the Dying Children of Niobe, in the Temple of the Sosian[2413]\r\nApollo, there is an equal degree of uncertainty, whether it is the\r\nwork[2414] of Scopas or of Praxiteles. So, too, as to the Father Janus,\r\na work that was brought from Egypt and dedicated in his Temple[2415]\r\nby Augustus, it is a question by which of these two artists[2416] it\r\nwas made: at the present day, however, it is quite hidden from us by\r\nthe quantity of gold that covers it. The same question, too, arises\r\nwith reference to the Cupid brandishing a Thunderbolt, now to be seen\r\nin the Curia of Octavia: the only thing, in fact, that is affirmed\r\nwith any degree of certainty respecting it, is, that it is a likeness\r\nof Alcibiades, who was the handsomest man of his day. There are, too,\r\nin the Schools[2417] of Octavia, many other highly attractive works,\r\nthe authors of which are now unknown: four Satyrs, for example, one of\r\nwhich carries in his arms a Father Liber, robed in the palla;[2418]\r\nanother similarly supports the Goddess Libera;[2419] a third is\r\npacifying a child who is crying; and a fourth is giving a child some\r\nwater to drink, from a cup; two Zephyrs also, who agitate their flowing\r\ndrapery with their breath. No less is the uncertainty that prevails as\r\nto the authors of the statues now to be seen in the Septa;[2420] an\r\nOlympus[2421] and Pan, and a Charon and Achilles;[2422] and yet their\r\nhigh reputation has caused them to be deemed valuable enough for their\r\nkeepers to be made answerable for their safety at the cost of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nScopas had for rivals and contemporaries, Bryaxis,[2423]\r\nTimotheus,[2424] and Leochares,[2425] artists whom we are bound to\r\nmention together, from the fact that they worked together at the\r\nMausoleum; such being the name of the tomb that was erected by his\r\nwife Artemisia in honour of Mausolus, a petty king of Caria, who\r\ndied in the second year of the hundred and seventh Olympiad. It was\r\nthrough the exertions of these artists more particularly, that this\r\nwork came to be reckoned one of the Seven Wonders of the World.[2426]\r\nThe circumference[2427] of this building is, in all, four hundred and\r\nforty feet, and the breadth from north to south sixty-three, the two\r\nfronts[2428] being not so wide in extent. It is twenty-five cubits\r\nin height, and is surrounded with six-and-thirty columns, the outer\r\ncircumference being known as the “Pteron.”[2429] The east side was\r\nsculptured by Scopas, the north by Bryaxis, the south by Timotheus,\r\nand the west by Leochares; but, before their task was completed, Queen\r\nArtemisia died.[2430] They did not leave their work, however, until it\r\nwas finished, considering that it was at once a memorial of their own\r\nfame and of the sculptor’s art: and, to this day even, it is undecided\r\nwhich of them has excelled. A fifth artist also took part in the work;\r\nfor above the Pteron there is a pyramid erected, equal in height\r\nto the building below, and formed of four and twenty steps, which\r\ngradually taper upwards towards the summit; a platform, crowned with a\r\nrepresentation of a four-horse chariot by Pythis. This addition makes\r\nthe total height of the work one hundred and forty feet.[2431]\r\n\r\nThere is at Rome, by Timotheus, a Diana, in the Temple of Apollo\r\nin the Palatium, the head of which has been replaced by Avianius\r\nEvander.[2432] A Hercules, too, by Menestratus,[2433] is greatly\r\nadmired; and there is a Hecate of his at Ephesus, in the Temple of\r\nDiana there, behind the sanctuary. The keepers of the temple recommend\r\npersons, when viewing it, to be careful of their eyes, so remarkably\r\nradiant is the marble. No less esteemed, too, are the statues of the\r\nGraces,[2434] in the Propylæum[2435] at Athens; the workmanship of\r\nSocrates the sculptor, a different person from the painter[2436] of\r\nthat name, though identical with him in the opinion of some. As to\r\nMyron,[2437] who is so highly praised for his works in bronze, there is\r\nby him at Smyrna, An Old Woman Intoxicated, a work that is held in high\r\nestimation.\r\n\r\nAsinius Pollio, a man of a warm and ardent temperament, was\r\ndetermined that the buildings which he erected as memorials of\r\nhimself should be made as attractive as possible; for here we see\r\ngroups representing, Nymphs carried off by Centaurs, a work of\r\nArcesilas:[2438] the Thespiades,[2439] by Cleomenes:[2440] Oceanus and\r\nJupiter, by Heniochus:[2441] the Appiades,[2442] by Stephanus:[2443]\r\nHermerotes,[2444] by Tauriscus, not the chaser in silver, already[2445]\r\nmentioned, but a native of Tralles:[2446] a Jupiter Hospitalis[2447]\r\nby Papylus, a pupil of Praxiteles: Zethus and Amphion, with Dirce,\r\nthe Bull,[2448] and the halter, all sculptured from a single block\r\nof marble, the work of Apollonius and Tauriscus, and brought to Rome\r\nfrom Rhodes. These two artists made it a sort of rivalry as to their\r\nparentage, for they declared that, although Apollodorus was their\r\nnatural progenitor, Menecrates[2449] would appear to have been their\r\nfather. In the same place, too, there is a Father Liber,[2450] by\r\nEutychides,[2451] highly praised. Near the Portico of Octavia, there\r\nis an Apollo, by Philiscus[2452] of Rhodes, placed in the Temple of\r\nthat God; a Latona and Diana also; the Nine Muses; and another Apollo,\r\nwithout drapery. The Apollo holding the Lyre, in the same temple,\r\nwas executed by Timarchides.[2453] In the Temple of Juno, within the\r\nPorticos of Octavia, there is a figure of that goddess, executed\r\nby Dionysius,[2454] and another by Polycles,[2455] as also other\r\nstatues by Praxiteles.[2456] This Polycles, too, in conjunction with\r\nDionysius,[2457] the son of Timarchides, made the statue of Jupiter,\r\nwhich is to be seen in the adjoining temple.[2458] The figures of Pan\r\nand Olympus Wrestling, in the same place, are by Heliodorus;[2459] and\r\nthey are considered to be the next finest group[2460] of this nature in\r\nall the world. The same artist also executed a Venus at the Bath, and\r\nPolycharmus another Venus, in an erect[2461] posture.\r\n\r\nBy the honourable place which the work of Lysias occupies, we may see\r\nin what high esteem it was held by the late Emperor Augustus, who\r\nconsecrated it in honour of his father Octavius, in the Palatium,\r\nplacing it on an arch within a small temple, adorned with columns:\r\nit is the figure of a four-horse chariot, with an Apollo and Diana,\r\nall sculptured from a single block. I find it stated, also, that the\r\nApollo by Calamis, the chaser already[2462] mentioned, the Pugilists\r\nby Dercylides, and the statue of Callisthenes the historian, by\r\nAmphistratus,[2463] all of them now in the Gardens of Servilius, are\r\nworks highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nBeyond these, there are not many sculptors of high repute; for, in the\r\ncase of several works of very great excellence, the number of artists\r\nthat have been engaged upon them has proved a considerable obstacle\r\nto the fame of each, no individual being able to engross the whole\r\nof the credit, and it being impossible to award it in due proportion\r\nto the names of the several artists combined. Such is the case with\r\nthe Laocoön, for example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus, a work\r\nthat may be looked upon as preferable to any other production of\r\nthe art of painting or of statuary. It is sculptured from a single\r\nblock, both the main figure as well as the children, and the serpents\r\nwith their marvellous folds. This group was made in concert by three\r\nmost eminent artists,[2464] Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus,\r\nnatives of Rhodes. In similar manner also, the palaces of the Cæsars,\r\nin the Palatium, have been filled with most splendid statuary, the\r\nwork of Craterus, in conjunction with Pythodorus, of Polydeuces with\r\nHermoläus, and of another Pythodorus with Artemon; some of the statues,\r\nalso, are by Aphrodisius of Tralles, who worked alone. The Pantheon of\r\nAgrippa has been decorated by Diogenes of Athens, and the Caryatides,\r\nby him, which form the columns of that temple, are looked upon as\r\nmaster-pieces of excellence: the same, too, with the statues that are\r\nplaced upon the roof, though, in consequence of the height, they have\r\nnot had an opportunity of being so well appreciated.\r\n\r\nWithout glory, and excluded from every temple, is the statue of\r\nHercules,[2465] in honour of whom the Carthaginians were accustomed to\r\nsacrifice human victims every year: it stands upon the ground before\r\nthe entrance of the Portico of the Nations.[2466] There were erected,\r\ntoo, near the Temple of Felicity, the statues of the Thespian[2467]\r\nMuses; of one of which, according to Varro, Junius Pisciculus, a Roman\r\nof equestrian rank, became enamoured. Pasiteles,[2468] too, speaks\r\nin terms of high admiration of them, the artist who wrote five Books\r\non the most celebrated works throughout the world. Born upon the\r\nGrecian[2469] shores of Italy, and presented with the Roman citizenship\r\ngranted to the cities of those parts, Pasiteles constructed the ivory\r\nstatue of Jupiter which is now in the Temple of Metellus,[2470] on the\r\nroad to the Campus Martius. It so happened, that being one day at the\r\nDocks,[2471] where there were some wild beasts from Africa, while he\r\nwas viewing through the bars of a cage a lion which he was engaged in\r\ndrawing, a panther made its escape from another cage, to the no small\r\ndanger of this most careful artist. He executed many other works, it is\r\nsaid, but we do not find the names of them specifically mentioned.\r\n\r\nArcesilaüs,[2472] also, is an artist highly extolled by Varro; who\r\nstates that he had in his possession a Lioness in marble of his,\r\nand Winged Cupids playing with it, some holding it with cords, and\r\nothers making it drink from a horn, the whole sculptured from a single\r\nblock: he says, also, that the fourteen figures around the Theatre\r\nof Pompeius,[2473] representing different Nations, are the work of\r\nCoponius.\r\n\r\nI find it stated that Canachus,[2474] an artist highly praised\r\namong the statuaries in bronze, executed some works also in marble.\r\nSaurus,[2475] too, and Batrachus must not be forgotten, Lacedæmonians\r\nby birth, who built the temples[2476] enclosed by the Porticos of\r\nOctavia. Some are of opinion that these artists were very wealthy\r\nmen, and that they erected these buildings at their own expense,\r\nexpecting to be allowed to inscribe their names thereon; but that, this\r\nindulgence being refused them, they adopted another method of attaining\r\ntheir object. At all events, there are still to be seen, at the present\r\nday, on the spirals[2477] of the columns, the figures of a lizard and\r\na frog,[2478] emblematical of their names. In the Temple of Jupiter by\r\nthe same artists, the paintings, as well as all the other ornaments,\r\nbear reference to the worship of a goddess. The[2479] fact is, that\r\nwhen the temple of Juno was completed, the porters, as it is said,\r\nwho were entrusted with the carriage of the statues, made an exchange\r\nof them; and, on religious grounds, the mistake was left uncorrected,\r\nfrom an impression that it had been by the intervention of the\r\ndivinities themselves, that this seat of worship had been thus shared\r\nbetween them. Hence it is that we see in the Temple of Juno, also, the\r\nornaments which properly pertain to the worship of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nSome minute works in marble have also gained reputation for their\r\nartists: by Myrmecides,[2480] there was a four-horse chariot, so small\r\nthat it could be covered, driver and all, by the wings of a fly; and by\r\nCallicrates,[2481] some ants, in marble, the feet and other limbs of\r\nwhich were so fine as to escape the sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5. (6.)—AT WHAT PERIOD MARBLE WAS FIRST USED IN BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis must suffice for the sculptors in marble, and the works that have\r\ngained the highest repute; with reference to which subject it occurs to\r\nme to remark, that spotted marbles were not then in fashion. In making\r\ntheir statues, these artists used the marble of Thasos also,[2482] one\r\nof the Cyclades, and of Lesbos, this last being rather more livid than\r\nthe other. The poet Menander, in fact, who was a very careful enquirer\r\ninto all matters of luxury, is the first who has spoken, and that but\r\nrarely, of variegated marbles, and, indeed, of the employment of marble\r\nin general. Columns of this material were at first employed in temples,\r\nnot on grounds of superior elegance, (for that was not thought of, as\r\nyet), but because no material could be found of a more substantial\r\nnature. It was under these circumstances, that the Temple[2483] of the\r\nOlympian Jupiter was commenced at Athens, the columns of which were\r\nbrought by Sylla to Rome, for the buildings in the Capitol.\r\n\r\nStill, however, there had been a distinction drawn between ordinary\r\nstone and marble, in the days of Homer even. The poet speaks in one\r\npassage of a person[2484] being struck down with a huge mass of marble;\r\nbut that is all; and when he describes the abodes of royalty adorned\r\nwith every elegance, besides brass, gold, electrum,[2485] and silver,\r\nhe only mentions ivory. Variegated marbles, in my opinion, were first\r\ndiscovered in the quarries of Chios, when the inhabitants were building\r\nthe walls of their city; a circumstance which gave rise to a facetious\r\nrepartee on the part of M. Cicero. It being the practice with them to\r\nshow these walls to everybody, as something magnificent; “I should\r\nadmire them much more,” said he, “if you had built them of the stone\r\nused at Tibur.”[2486] And, by Hercules! the art of painting[2487] never\r\nwould have been held in such esteem, or, indeed, in any esteem at all,\r\nif variegated marbles had been held in admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—WHO WERE THE FIRST TO CUT MARBLE INTO SLABS, AND AT WHAT\r\nPERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure whether the art of cutting marble into slabs, is not an\r\ninvention for which we are indebted to the people of Caria. The most\r\nancient instance of this practice, so far as I know of, is found in the\r\npalace of Mausolus, at Halicarnassus, the walls of which, in brick, are\r\ncovered with marble of Proconnesus. Mausolus died in the second year of\r\nthe hundred and seventh[2488] Olympiad, being the year of Rome, 403.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—WHO WAS THE FIRST TO ENCRUST THE WALLS OF HOUSES AT ROME WITH\r\nMARBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first person at Rome who covered the whole of the walls of\r\nhis house with marble, according to Cornelius Nepos,[2489] was\r\nMamurra,[2490] who dwelt upon the Cælian Hill, a member of the\r\nequestrian order, and a native of Formiæ, who had been præfect of\r\nthe engineers under C. Cæsar in Gaul. Such was the individual, that\r\nnothing may be wanting to the indignity of the example, who first\r\nadopted this practice; the same Mamurra, in fact, who has been so torn\r\nto pieces in the verses of Catullus of Verona. Indeed, his own house\r\nproclaimed more loudly than Catullus could proclaim it, that he had\r\ncome into possession of all that Gallia Comata had had to possess. For\r\nNepos adds, as well, that he was the first to have all the columns of\r\nhis house made of nothing but solid marble, and that, too, marble of\r\nCarystus[2491] or of Luna.[2492]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—AT WHAT PERIOD THE VARIOUS KINDS OF MARBLE CAME INTO USE AT\r\nROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Lepidus, who was consul with Q. Catulus, was the first to have the\r\nlintels of his house made of Numidian marble, a thing for which he\r\nwas greatly censured: he was consul in the year of Rome, 676. This is\r\nthe earliest instance that I can find of the introduction of Numidian\r\nmarble; not in the form of pillars, however, or of slabs, as was the\r\ncase with the marble of Carystus, above-mentioned, but in blocks,\r\nand that too, for the comparatively ignoble purpose of making the\r\nthresholds of doors. Four-years after this Lepidus, L. Lucullus was\r\nconsul; the same person who gave its name, it is very evident, to the\r\nLucullan marble; for, taking a great fancy to it, he introduced it at\r\nRome. While other kinds of marble are valued for their spots or their\r\ncolours, this marble is entirely black.[2493] It is found in the island\r\nof Melos,[2494] and is pretty nearly the only marble that has taken its\r\nname from the person who first introduced it. Among these personages,\r\nScaurus, in my opinion, was the first to build a theatre with walls of\r\nmarble: but whether they were only coated with slabs of marble or were\r\nmade of solid blocks highly polished, such as we now see in the Temple\r\nof Jupiter Tonans,[2495] in the Capitol, I cannot exactly say: for, up\r\nto this period, I cannot find any vestiges of the use of marble slabs\r\nin Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9.—THE METHOD OF CUTTING MARBLE INTO SLABS. THE SAND USED IN\r\nCUTTING MARBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut whoever it was that first invented the art of thus cutting marble,\r\nand so multiplying the appliances of luxury, he displayed considerable\r\ningenuity, though to little purpose. This division, though apparently\r\neffected by the aid of iron, is in reality effected by sand; the saw\r\nacting only by pressing upon the sand within a very fine cleft in the\r\nstone, as it is moved to and fro.\r\n\r\nThe[2496] sand of Æthiopia is the most highly esteemed for this\r\npurpose; for, to add to the trouble that is entailed, we have to send\r\nto Æthiopia for the purpose of preparing our marble—aye, and as far as\r\nIndia even; whereas in former times, the severity of the Roman manners\r\nthought it beneath them to repair thither in search of such costly\r\nthings even as pearls! This Indian sand is held in the next highest\r\ndegree of estimation, the Æthiopian being of a softer nature, and\r\nbetter adapted for dividing the stone without leaving any roughness\r\non the surface; whereas the sand from India does not leave so smooth\r\na face upon it. Still, however, for polishing marble, we find it\r\nrecommended[2497] to rub it with Indian sand calcined. The sand of\r\nNaxos has the same defect; as also that from Coptos, generally known as\r\n“Egyptian” sand.\r\n\r\nThe above were the several varieties of sand used by the ancients\r\nin dividing marble. More recently, a sand has been discovered that\r\nis equally approved of for this purpose; in a certain creek of the\r\nAdriatic Sea, which is left dry at low water only; a thing that\r\nrenders it not very easy to be found. At the present day, however, the\r\nfraudulent tendencies of our workers in marble have emboldened them to\r\nuse any kind of river-sand for the purpose; a mischief which very few\r\nemployers rightly appreciate. For, the coarser the sand, the wider is\r\nthe division made in the stone, the greater the quantity of material\r\nconsumed, and the more extensive the labour required for polishing the\r\nrough surface that is left; a result of which is that the slabs lose\r\nso much more in thickness. For giving the last polish to marble,[2498]\r\nThebaic stone[2499] is considered well adapted, as also porous stone,\r\nor pumice, powdered fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10. (7.)—STONE OF NAXOS. STONE OF ARMENIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor polishing marble statues, as also for cutting and giving a polish\r\nto precious stones, the preference was long given to the stone of\r\nNaxos,[2500] such being the name of a kind of touchstone[2501] that\r\nis found in the Isle of Cyprus. More recently, however, the stones\r\nimported from Armenia for this purpose have displaced those of Naxos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—THE MARBLES OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe marbles are too well known to make it necessary for me to enumerate\r\ntheir several colours and varieties; and, indeed, so numerous are they,\r\nthat it would be no easy task to do so. For what place is there, in\r\nfact, that has not a marble of its own? In addition to which, in our\r\ndescription of the earth and its various peoples,[2502] we have already\r\nmade it our care to mention the more celebrated kinds of marble. Still,\r\nhowever, they are not all of them produced from quarries, but in many\r\ninstances lie scattered just beneath the surface of the earth; some\r\nof them the most precious even, the green Lacedæmonian marble, for\r\nexample, more brilliant in colour than any other; the Augustan also;\r\nand, more recently, the Tiberian; which were first discovered, in the\r\nreigns respectively of Augustus and Tiberius, in Egypt. These two\r\nmarbles differ from ophites[2503] in the circumstance that the latter\r\nis marked with streaks which resemble serpents[2504] in appearance,\r\nwhence its name. There is also this difference between the two marbles\r\nthemselves, in the arrangement of their spots: the Augustan marble has\r\nthem undulated and curling to a point; whereas in the Tiberian the\r\nstreaks are white,[2505] not involved, but lying wide asunder.\r\n\r\nOf ophites, there are only some very small pillars known to have\r\nbeen made. There are two varieties of it, one white and soft, the\r\nother inclining to black, and hard. Both kinds, it is said, worn as\r\nan amulet, are a cure for head-ache, and for wounds inflicted by\r\nserpents.[2506] Some, too, recommend the white ophites as an amulet for\r\nphrenitis and lethargy. As a counter-poison to serpents, some persons\r\nspeak more particularly in praise of the ophites that is known as\r\n“tephrias,”[2507] from its ashy colour. There is also a marble known as\r\n“memphites,” from the place[2508] where it is found, and of a nature\r\nsomewhat analogous to the precious stones. For medicinal purposes, it\r\nis triturated and applied in the form of a liniment, with vinegar, to\r\nsuch parts of the body as require cauterizing or incision; the flesh\r\nbecoming quite benumbed, and thereby rendered insensible to pain.\r\n\r\nPorphyrites,[2509] which is another production of Egypt, is of a\r\nred colour: the kind that is mottled with white blotches is known\r\nas “leptospsephos.”[2510] The quarries there are able to furnish\r\nblocks[2511] of any dimensions, however large. Vitrasius Pollio, who\r\nwas steward[2512] in Egypt for the Emperor Claudius, brought to Rome\r\nfrom Egypt some statues made of this stone; a novelty which was not\r\nvery highly approved of, as no one has since followed his example.\r\nThe Egyptians, too, have discovered in Æthiopia the stone known as\r\n“basanites;”[2513] which in colour and hardness resembles iron,\r\nwhence the name[2514] that has been given to it. A larger block of it\r\nhas never been known than the one forming the group which has been\r\ndedicated by the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus in the Temple of Peace.\r\nIt represents the river Nilus with sixteen children sporting around\r\nit,[2515] symbolical of the sixteen cubits, the extreme height[2516]\r\nto which, in the most favourable seasons, that river should rise. It\r\nis stated, too, that in the Temple of Serapis at Thebes, there is a\r\nblock not unlike it, which forms the statue of Memnon[2517] there;\r\nremarkable, it is said, for emitting a sound each morning when first\r\ntouched by the rays of the rising sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—ONYX AND ALABASTRITES; SIX REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur forefathers imagined that onyx[2518] was only to be found in the\r\nmountains of Arabia, and nowhere else; but Sudines[2519] was aware that\r\nit is also found in Carmania.[2520] Drinking-vessels were made of it at\r\nfirst, and then the feet of beds and chairs. Cornelius Nepos relates\r\nthat great was the astonishment, when P. Lentulus Spinther exhibited\r\namphoræ made of this material, as large as Chian wine-vessels in size;\r\n“and yet, five years after,” says he, “I saw columns of this material,\r\nno less than two-and-thirty feet in height.” At a more recent period\r\nagain, some change took place[2521] with reference to this stone; for\r\nfour[2522] small pillars of it were erected by Cornelius Balbus in\r\nhis Theatre[2523] as something quite marvellous: and I myself have\r\nseen thirty columns, of larger size, in the banquetting-room which\r\nCallistus[2524] erected, the freedman of Claudius, so well known for\r\nthe influence which he possessed.\r\n\r\n(8.) This[2525] stone is called “alabastrites”[2526] by some, and\r\nis hollowed out into vessels for holding unguents, it having the\r\nreputation of preserving them from corruption[2527] better than\r\nanything else. In a calcined state, it is a good ingredient for\r\nplaisters.[2528] It is found in the vicinity of Thebes in Egypt and\r\nof Damascus in Syria, that of Damascus being whiter than the others.\r\nThe most esteemed kind, however, is that of Carmania, the next being\r\nthe produce of India, and then, those of Syria and Asia. The worst in\r\nquality is that of Cappadocia, it being utterly destitute of lustre.\r\nThat which is of a honey colour is the most esteemed, covered with\r\nspots curling in whirls,[2529] and not transparent. Alabastrites\r\nis considered defective, when it is of a white or horn colour, or\r\napproaching to glass in appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—LYGDINUS; CORALLITIC STONE; STONE OF ALABANDA; STONE OF\r\nTHEBAIS; STONE OF SYENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle inferior to it for the preservation of unguents, in the opinion\r\nof many, is the stone, called “lygdinus,”[2530] that is found in Paros,\r\nand never of a larger size than to admit of a dish or goblet being\r\nmade of it. In former times, it was only imported from Arabia, being\r\nremarkable for its extreme whiteness.\r\n\r\nGreat value is placed also upon two other kinds of stone, of quite a\r\ncontrary nature; corallitic[2531] stone, found in Asia, in blocks not\r\nmore than two cubits in thickness, and of a white somewhat approaching\r\nthat of ivory, and in some degree resembling it; and Alabandic\r\nstone, which, on the other hand, is black, and is so called from the\r\ndistrict[2532] which produces it: though it is also to be found at\r\nMiletus, where, however, it verges somewhat more upon the purple. It\r\nadmits of being melted by the action of fire, and is fused for the\r\npreparation of glass.\r\n\r\nThebaic stone, which is sprinkled all over with spots like gold, is\r\nfound in Africa, on the side of it which lies adjacent to Egypt; the\r\nsmall hones which it supplies being peculiarly adapted, from their\r\nnatural properties, for grinding the ingredients used in preparations\r\nfor the eyes. In the neighbourhood of Syene, too, in Thebais, there is\r\na stone found that is now known as “syenites,”[2533] but was formerly\r\ncalled “pyrrhopœcilon.”[2534]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—OBELISKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonarchs, too, have entered into a sort of rivalry with one another\r\nin forming elongated blocks of this stone, known as “obelisks,”[2535]\r\nand consecrated to the divinity of the Sun. The blocks had this form\r\ngiven to them in resemblance to the rays of that luminary, which are so\r\ncalled[2536] in the Egyptian language.\r\n\r\nMesphres,[2537] who reigned in the City of the Sun,[2538] was the first\r\nwho erected one of these obelisks, being warned to do so in a dream;\r\nindeed, there is an inscription upon the obelisk to this effect; for\r\nthe sculptures and figures which we still see engraved thereon are no\r\nother than Egyptian letters.[2539]\r\n\r\nAt a later period other kings had these obelisks hewn. Sesosthes[2540]\r\nerected four of them in the above-named city, forty-eight cubits in\r\nheight. Rhamsesis,[2541] too, who was reigning at the time of the\r\ncapture of Troy, erected one, a hundred and forty cubits high. Having\r\nquitted the spot where the palace of Mnevis[2542] stood, this monarch\r\nerected another obelisk,[2543] one hundred and twenty cubits in height,\r\nbut of prodigious thickness, the sides being no less than eleven cubits\r\nin breadth. (9.) It is said that one hundred and twenty thousand men\r\nwere employed upon this work;[2543] and that the king, when it was on\r\nthe point of being elevated, being apprehensive that the machinery\r\nemployed might not prove strong enough for the weight, with the view of\r\nincreasing the peril that might be entailed by due want of precaution\r\non the part of the workmen, had his own son fastened to the summit; in\r\norder that the safety of the prince might at the same time ensure the\r\nsafety of the mass of stone. It was in his admiration of this work,\r\nthat, when King Cambyses took the city by storm, and the conflagration\r\nhad already reached the very foot of the obelisk, he ordered the fire\r\nto be extinguished; he entertaining a respect for this stupendous\r\nerection which he had not entertained for the city itself.\r\n\r\nThere are also two other obelisks, one of them erected by\r\nZmarres,[2544] and the other by Phius;[2545] both of them without\r\ninscriptions, and forty-eight cubits in height. Ptolemæus Philadelphus\r\nhad one erected at Alexandria, eighty cubits high, which had been\r\nprepared by order of King Necthebis:[2546] it was without any\r\ninscription, and cost far more trouble in its carriage and elevation,\r\nthan had been originally expended in quarrying it. Some writers\r\ninform us that it was conveyed on a raft, under the inspection of the\r\narchitect Satyrus; but Callixenus[2547] gives the name of Phœnix.\r\nFor this purpose, a canal was dug from the river Nilus to the spot\r\nwhere the obelisk lay; and two broad vessels, laden with blocks of\r\nsimilar stone a foot square, the cargo of each amounting to double\r\nthe size, and consequently double the weight, of the obelisk, were\r\nbrought beneath it; the extremities, of the obelisk remaining supported\r\nby the opposite sides of the canal. The blocks of stone were then\r\nremoved, and the vessels, being thus gradually lightened, received\r\ntheir burden. It was erected upon a basis of six square blocks,\r\nquarried from the same mountain, and the artist was rewarded with\r\nthe sum of fifty talents.[2548] This obelisk was placed by the king\r\nabove-mentioned in the Arsinoœum,[2549] in testimony of his affection\r\nfor his wife and sister Arsinoë. At a later period, as it was found to\r\nbe an inconvenience to the docks, Maximus, the then præfect of Egypt,\r\nhad it transferred to the Forum there, after removing the summit for\r\nthe purpose of substituting a gilded point; an intention which was\r\nultimately abandoned.\r\n\r\nThere are two other obelisks, which were in Cæsar’s Temple at\r\nAlexandria, near the harbour there, forty-two cubits in height, and\r\noriginally hewn by order of King Mesphres. But the most difficult\r\nenterprise of all, was the carriage of these obelisks by sea to Rome,\r\nin vessels which excited the greatest admiration. Indeed, the late\r\nEmperor Augustus consecrated the one which brought over the first\r\nobelisk, as a lasting memorial of this marvellous undertaking, in\r\nthe docks at Puteoli; but it was destroyed by fire. As to the one in\r\nwhich, by order of the Emperor Caius,[2550] the other obelisk had been\r\ntransported to Rome, after having been preserved for some years and\r\nlooked upon as the most wonderful construction ever beheld upon the\r\nseas, it was brought to Ostia, by order of the late Emperor Claudius;\r\nand towers of Puteolan[2551] earth being first erected upon it, it was\r\nsunk for the construction of the harbour which he was making there. And\r\nthen, besides, there was the necessity of constructing other vessels\r\nto carry these obelisks up the Tiber; by which it became practically\r\nascertained, that the depth of water in that river is not less than\r\nthat of the river Nilus.\r\n\r\nThe obelisk that was erected by the late Emperor Augustus in the\r\nGreat Circus,[2552] was originally quarried by order of King\r\nSemenpserteus,[2553] in whose reign it was that Pythagoras[2554]\r\nvisited Egypt. It is eighty-five feet[2555] and three quarters in\r\nheight, exclusive of the base, which is a part of the same stone. The\r\none that he erected in the Campus Martius, is nine feet less in height,\r\nand was originally made by order of Sesothis. They are both of them\r\ncovered with inscriptions, which interpret the operations of Nature\r\naccording to the philosophy of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (10.)—THE OBELISK WHICH SERVES AS A DIAL IN THE CAMPUS\r\nMARTIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe one that has been erected in the Campus Martius[2556] has been\r\napplied to a singular purpose by the late Emperor Augustus; that of\r\nmarking the shadows projected by the sun, and so measuring the length\r\nof the days and nights. With this object, a stone pavement was laid,\r\nthe extreme length of which corresponded exactly with the length of\r\nthe shadow thrown by the obelisk at the sixth hour[2557] on the day of\r\nthe winter solstice. After this period, the shadow would go on, day\r\nby day, gradually decreasing, and then again[2558] would as gradually\r\nincrease, correspondingly with certain lines of brass that were\r\ninserted in the stone; a device well deserving to be known, and due to\r\nthe ingenuity of Facundus Novus, the mathematician. Upon the apex of\r\nthe obelisk he placed a gilded ball, in order that the shadow of the\r\nsummit might be condensed and agglomerated, and so prevent the shadow\r\nof the apex itself from running to a fine point of enormous extent; the\r\nplan being first suggested to him, it is said, by the shadow that is\r\nprojected by the human head. For nearly the last thirty years, however,\r\nthe observations derived from this dial have been found not to agree:\r\nwhether it is that the sun itself has changed its course in consequence\r\nof some derangement of the heavenly system; or whether that the whole\r\nearth has been in some degree displaced from its centre, a thing that,\r\nI have heard say, has been remarked in other places as well; or whether\r\nthat some earthquake, confined to this city only, has wrenched the dial\r\nfrom its original position; or whether it is that in consequence of the\r\ninundations of the Tiber, the foundations of the mass have subsided,\r\nin spite of the general assertion that they are sunk as deep into the\r\nearth as the obelisk erected upon them is high.\r\n\r\n(11.) The third[2559] obelisk[2560] at Rome is in the Vaticanian[2561]\r\nCircus, which was constructed by the Emperors Caius[2562] and Nero;\r\nthis being the only one of them all that has been broken in the\r\ncarriage. Nuncoreus,[2563] the son of Sesoses, made it: and there\r\nremains[2564] another by him, one hundred cubits in height, which, by\r\norder of an oracle, he consecrated to the Sun, after having lost his\r\nsight and recovered it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16. (12.)—MARVELLOUS WORKS IN EGYPT. THE PYRAMIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must make some mention, too, however cursorily, of the Pyramids\r\nof Egypt, so many idle[2565] and frivolous pieces of ostentation of\r\ntheir resources, on the part of the monarchs of that country. Indeed,\r\nit is asserted by most persons, that the only motive for constructing\r\nthem, was either a determination not to leave their treasures to their\r\nsuccessors or to rivals that might be plotting to supplant them, or to\r\nprevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied. There was great\r\nvanity displayed by these men in constructions of this description, and\r\nthere are still the remains of many of them in an unfinished state.\r\nThere is one to be seen in the Nome of Arsinoïtes;[2566] two in that\r\nof Memphites, not far from the Labyrinth, of which we shall shortly\r\nhave to speak;[2567] and two in the place where Lake Mœris[2568] was\r\nexcavated, an immense artificial piece of water, cited by the Egyptians\r\namong their wondrous and memorable works: the summits of the pyramids,\r\nit is said, are to be seen above the water.\r\n\r\nThe other three pyramids, the renown of which has filled the whole\r\nearth, and which are conspicuous from every quarter to persons\r\nnavigating the river, are situate on the African[2569] side of it, upon\r\na rocky sterile elevation. They lie between the city of Memphis and\r\nwhat we have mentioned[2570] as the Delta, within four miles of the\r\nriver, and seven miles and a-half from Memphis, near a village known as\r\nBusiris, the people of which are in the habit of ascending them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—THE EGYPTIAN SPHINX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn front of these pyramids is the Sphinx,[2571] a still more wondrous\r\nobject of art, but one upon which silence has been observed, as it is\r\nlooked upon as a divinity by the people of the neighbourhood. It is\r\ntheir belief that King Harmaïs was buried in it, and they will have it\r\nthat it was brought there from a distance. The truth is, however, that\r\nit was hewn from the solid rock; and, from a feeling of veneration, the\r\nface of the monster is coloured red. The circumference of the head,\r\nmeasured round the forehead, is one hundred and two feet, the length of\r\nthe feet being one hundred and forty-three, and the height, from the\r\nbelly to the summit of the asp on the head, sixty-two.[2572]\r\n\r\nThe largest[2573] Pyramid is built of stone quarried in Arabia:\r\nthree hundred and sixty thousand men, it is said, were employed\r\nupon it twenty years, and the three were completed in seventy-eight\r\nyears and four months. They are described by the following writers:\r\nHerodotus,[2574] Euhemerus, Duris of Samos, Aristagoras, Dionysius,\r\nArtemidorus, Alexander Polyhistor, Butoridas, Antisthenes, Demetrius,\r\nDemoteles, and Apion. These authors, however, are disagreed as to\r\nthe persons by whom they were constructed; accident having, with\r\nvery considerable justice, consigned to oblivion the names of those\r\nwho erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity. Some of these\r\nwriters inform us that fifteen hundred talents were expended upon\r\nradishes, garlic, and onions[2575] alone.\r\n\r\nThe largest Pyramid occupies seven[2576] jugera of ground, and the\r\nfour angles are equidistant, the face of each side being eight hundred\r\nand thirty-three[2577] feet in length. The total height from the\r\nground to the summit is seven hundred and twenty-five feet, and the\r\nplatform on the summit is sixteen feet and a-half in circuit. Of the\r\nsecond Pyramid, the faces of the four sides are each seven hundred\r\nand fifty-seven feet and a-half in length.[2578] The third is smaller\r\nthan the others, but far more prepossessing in appearance: it is built\r\nof Æthiopian stone,[2579] and the face between the four corners is\r\nthree hundred and sixty-three feet in extent. In the vicinity of these\r\nerections, there are no vestiges of any buildings left. Far and wide\r\nthere is nothing but sand to be seen, of a grain somewhat like a lentil\r\nin appearance, similar to that of the greater part of Africa, in fact.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult problem is, to know how the materials for\r\nconstruction could possibly be carried to so vast a height. According\r\nto some authorities, as the building gradually advanced, they heaped\r\nup against it vast mounds of nitre[2580] and salt; which piles were\r\nmelted after its completion, by introducing beneath them the waters\r\nof the river. Others, again, maintain, that bridges were constructed,\r\nof bricks of clay, and that, when the pyramid was completed, these\r\nbricks were distributed for erecting the houses of private individuals.\r\nFor[2581] the level of the river, they say, being so much lower,\r\nwater could never by any possibility have been brought there by the\r\nmedium of canals. In the interior of the largest Pyramid there is a\r\nwell, eighty-six cubits deep, which communicates with the river, it\r\nis thought. The method of ascertaining the height of the Pyramids and\r\nall similar edifices was discovered[2582] by Thales of Miletus; he\r\nmeasuring the shadow at the hour of the day at which it is equal in\r\nlength to the body projecting it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the marvellous Pyramids; but the crowning marvel of all\r\nis, that the smallest, but most admired of them—that we may feel no\r\nsurprise at the opulence of the kings—was built by Rhodopis,[2583]\r\na courtesan! This woman was once the fellow-slave of Æsopus the\r\nphilosopher and fabulist, and the sharer of his bed; but what is much\r\nmore surprising is, that a courtesan should have been enabled, by her\r\nvocation, to amass such enormous wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—THE PHAROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another building, too, that is highly celebrated; the tower\r\nthat was built by a king of Egypt, on the island of Pharos, at the\r\nentrance to the[2584] harbour of Alexandria. The cost of its erection\r\nwas eight hundred talents, they say; and, not to omit the magnanimity\r\nthat was shown by King Ptolemæus[2585] on this occasion, he gave\r\npermission to the architect, Sostratus[2586] of Cnidos, to inscribe his\r\nname upon the edifice itself. The object of it is, by the light of its\r\nfires at night, to give warning to ships, of the neighbouring shoals,\r\nand to point out to them the entrance of the harbour. At the present\r\nday, there are similar fires lighted up in numerous places, Ostia and\r\nRavenna, for example. The only danger[2587] is, that when these fires\r\nare thus kept burning without intermission, they may be mistaken for\r\nstars, the flames having very much that appearance at a distance. This\r\narchitect is the first person that built a promenade upon arches; at\r\nCnidos, it is said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19. (13.)—LABYRINTHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must speak also of the Labyrinths, the most stupendous works,\r\nperhaps, on which mankind has expended its labours; and not for\r\nchimerical purposes, merely, as might possibly be supposed.\r\n\r\nThere is still in Egypt, in the Nome of Heracleopolites,[2588] a\r\nlabyrinth,[2589] which was the first constructed, three thousand six\r\nhundred years ago, they say, by King Petesuchis or Tithöes: although,\r\naccording to Herodotus, the entire work was the production of no less\r\nthan twelve kings, the last of whom was Psammetichus. As to the\r\npurpose for which it was built, there are various opinions: Demoteles\r\nsays that it was the palace of King Moteris, and Lyceas that it was\r\nthe tomb of Mœris, while many others assert that it was a building\r\nconsecrated to the Sun, an opinion which mostly prevails.\r\n\r\nThat Dædalus took this for the model of the Labyrinth which he\r\nconstructed in Crete, there can be no doubt; though he only reproduced\r\nthe hundredth part of it, that portion, namely, which encloses\r\ncircuitous passages, windings, and inextricable galleries which lead\r\nto and fro. We must not, comparing this last to what we see delineated\r\non our mosaic pavements, or to the mazes[2590] formed in the fields\r\nfor the amusement of children, suppose it to be a narrow promenade\r\nalong which we may walk for many miles together; but we must picture\r\nto ourselves a building filled with numerous doors, and galleries\r\nwhich continually mislead the visitor, bringing him back, after all\r\nhis wanderings, to the spot from which he first set out. This[2591]\r\nLabyrinth is the second, that of Egypt being the first. There is a\r\nthird in the Isle of Lemnos, and a fourth in Italy.\r\n\r\nThey are all of them covered with arched roofs of polished stone; at\r\nthe entrance, too, of the Egyptian Labyrinth, a thing that surprises\r\nme, the building is constructed of Parian marble, while throughout\r\nthe other parts of it the columns are of syenites.[2592] With such\r\nsolidity is this huge mass constructed, that the lapse of ages has been\r\ntotally unable to destroy it, seconded as it has been by the people of\r\nHeracleopolites, who have marvellously ravaged a work which they have\r\nalways held in abhorrence. To detail the position of this work and\r\nthe various portions of it is quite impossible, it being subdivided\r\ninto regions and præfectures, which are styled nomes,[2593] thirty in\r\nnumber, with a vast palace assigned to each. In addition to these, it\r\nshould contain temples of all the gods of Egypt, and forty statues of\r\nNemesis[2594] in as many sacred shrines; besides numerous pyramids,\r\nforty ells[2595] in height, and covering six aruræ[2596] at the base.\r\nFatigued with wandering to and fro, the visitor is sure to arrive at\r\nsome inextricable crossing or other of the galleries. And then, too,\r\nthere are banquetting rooms situate at the summit of steep ascents;\r\nporticos from which we descend by flights of ninety steps; columns in\r\nthe interior, made of porphyrites;[2597] figures of gods; statues of\r\nkings; and effigies of hideous monsters. Some of the palaces are so\r\npeculiarly constructed, that the moment the doors are opened a dreadful\r\nsound like that of thunder reverberates within: the greater part,\r\ntoo, of these edifices have to be traversed in total darkness. Then\r\nagain, without the walls of the Labyrinth, there rises another mass of\r\nbuildings known as the “Pteron;”[2598] beneath which there are passages\r\nexcavated leading to other subterranean palaces. One person, and only\r\none, has made some slight repairs to the Labyrinth; Chæremon,[2599] an\r\neunuch of King Necthebis, who lived five hundred years before the time\r\nof Alexander the Great. It is asserted, also, that while the arched\r\nroofs of squared stone were being raised, he had them supported by\r\nbeams of thorn[2600] boiled in oil.\r\n\r\nAs for the Cretan Labyrinth, what I have already stated must suffice\r\nfor that. The Labyrinth of Lemnos[2601] is similar to it, only that\r\nit is rendered more imposing by its hundred and fifty columns; the\r\nshafts of which, when in the stone-yard, were so nicely balanced, that\r\na child was able to manage the wheel of the lathe in turning them. The\r\narchitects were, Smilis,[2602] Rhœcus,[2603] and Theodorus, natives\r\nof the island, and there are still in existence some remains of it;\r\nwhereas of the Cretan Labyrinth and of that in Italy not a vestige is\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nAs to this last, which Porsena, King of Etruria, erected as his\r\nintended sepulchre, it is only proper that I should make some mention\r\nof it, if only to show that the vanity displayed by foreign monarchs,\r\ngreat as it is, has been surpassed. But as the fabulousness of the\r\nstory connected with it quite exceeds all bounds, I shall employ the\r\nwords given by M. Varro himself in his account of it:—“Porsena was\r\nburied,” says he, “beneath the city of Clusium;[2604] in the spot\r\nwhere he had had constructed a square monument, built of squared stone.\r\nEach side of this monument was three hundred feet in length and fifty\r\nin height, and beneath the base, which was also square, there was an\r\ninextricable labyrinth, into which if any one entered without a clew\r\nof thread, he could never find his way out. Above this square building\r\nthere stand five pyramids, one at each corner, and one in the middle,\r\nseventy-five feet broad at the base, and one hundred and fifty feet in\r\nheight. These pyramids are so tapering in their form, that upon the\r\nsummit of all of them united there rests a brazen globe, and upon that\r\na petasus;[2605] from which there hang, suspended by chains, bells,\r\nwhich make a tinkling when agitated by the wind, like what was done\r\nat Dodona[2606] in former times. Upon this globe there are four other\r\npyramids, each one hundred feet in height; and above them is a single\r\nplatform, on which there are five more pyramids,”[2607]—the height of\r\nwhich Varro has evidently felt ashamed to add; but, according to the\r\nEtruscan fables, it was equal to that of the rest of the building.\r\nWhat downright madness this, to attempt to seek glory at an outlay\r\nwhich can never be of utility to any one; to say nothing of exhausting\r\nthe resources of the kingdom, and after all, that the artist may reap\r\nthe greater share of the praise!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—HANGING GARDENS. A HANGING CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe read, too, of hanging gardens,[2608] and what is even more than\r\nthis, a hanging city,[2609] Thebes in Egypt: it being the practice\r\nfor the kings to lead forth their armies from beneath, while the\r\ninhabitants were totally unconscious of it. This, too, is even less\r\nsurprising than the fact that a river flows through the middle of the\r\ncity. If, however, all this had really been the case, there is no doubt\r\nthat Homer would have mentioned it, he who has celebrated the hundred\r\ngates of Thebes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (14.)—THE TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful monument of Græcian magnificence, and one that\r\nmerits our genuine admiration, is the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, which\r\ntook one hundred and twenty years in building, a work in which all\r\nAsia[2610] joined. A marshy soil was selected for its site, in order\r\nthat it might not suffer from earthquakes, or the chasms which they\r\nproduce. On the other hand, again, that the foundations of so vast\r\na pile might not have to rest upon a loose and shifting bed, layers\r\nof trodden charcoal were placed beneath, with fleeces[2611] covered\r\nwith wool upon the top of them. The entire length of the temple is\r\nfour hundred and twenty-five feet, and the breadth two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five. The columns are one hundred and twenty-seven in number,\r\nand sixty feet in height, each of them presented by a different king.\r\nThirty-six of these columns are carved, and one of them by the hand of\r\nScopas.[2612] Chersiphron[2613] was the architect who presided over the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe great marvel in this building is, how such ponderous\r\narchitraves[2614] could possibly have been raised to so great a height.\r\nThis, however, the architect effected by means of bags filled with\r\nsand, which he piled up upon an inclined plane until they reached\r\nbeyond the capitals of the columns; then, as he gradually emptied the\r\nlower bags, the architraves[2615] insensibly settled in the places\r\nassigned them. But the greatest difficulty of all was found, in laying\r\nthe lintel which he placed over the entrance-doors. It was an enormous\r\nmass of stone, and by no possibility could it be brought to lie level\r\nupon the jambs which formed its bed; in consequence of which, the\r\narchitect was driven to such a state of anxiety and desperation as to\r\ncontemplate suicide. Wearied and quite worn out by such thoughts as\r\nthese, during the night, they say, he beheld in a dream the goddess in\r\nhonour of whom the temple was being erected; who exhorted him to live\r\non, for that she herself had placed the stone in its proper position.\r\nAnd such, in fact, next morning, was found to be the case, the stone\r\napparently having come to the proper level by dint of its own weight.\r\nThe other decorations of this work would suffice to fill many volumes,\r\nbut they do not tend in any way to illustrate the works of Nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22. (15.)—MARVELS CONNECTED WITH OTHER TEMPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere still exists, too, at Cyzicus,[2616] a temple of polished stone,\r\nbetween all the joints of which the artist has inserted a thread of\r\ngold; it being his intention to erect an ivory statue of Jupiter\r\nwithin, with Apollo in marble crowning him. The result is, that the\r\ninterstices quite glisten with their fine, hair-like threads; and the\r\nreflection of the gold, obscured as it is, gently falling upon the\r\nstatues, besides proclaiming the genius of the artist, heightens their\r\neffect, and so teaches us to appreciate the costliness of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—THE FUGITIVE STONE. THE SEVEN-FOLD ECHO. BUILDINGS ERECTED\r\nWITHOUT THE USE OF NAILS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same city also, there is a stone, known as the “Fugitive\r\nStone;”[2617] the Argonautæ, who used it for the purposes of an anchor,\r\nhaving left it there. This stone having repeatedly taken flight from\r\nthe Prytanæum,[2618] the place so called where it is kept, it has been\r\nfastened down with lead. In this city also, near the gate which is\r\nknown as the “Trachia,”[2619] there are seven towers, which repeat a\r\nnumber of times all sounds that are uttered in them. This phenomenon,\r\nto which the name of “Echo,” has been given by the Greeks, depends upon\r\nthe peculiar conformation of localities, and is produced in valleys\r\nmore particularly. At Cyzicus, however, it is the effect of accident\r\nonly; while at Olympia, it is produced by artificial means, and in\r\na very marvellous manner; in a portico there, which is known as the\r\n“Heptaphonon,”[2620] from the circumstance that it returns the sound of\r\nthe voice seven times.\r\n\r\nAt Cyzicus, also, is the Buleuterium,[2621] a vast edifice, constructed\r\nwithout a nail of iron; the raftering being so contrived as to admit\r\nof the beams being removed and replaced without the use of stays.\r\nA similar thing, too, is the case with the Sublician Bridge[2622]\r\nat Rome; and this by enactment, on religious grounds, there having\r\nbeen such difficulty experienced in breaking it down when Horatius\r\nCocles”[2623] defended it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—MARVELLOUS BUILDINGS AT ROME, EIGHTEEN IN NUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is now time to pass on to the marvels in building displayed\r\nby our own City, and to make some enquiry into the resources and\r\nexperience that we have gained in the lapse of eight hundred years; and\r\nso prove that here, as well, the rest of the world has been outdone by\r\nus: a thing which will appear, in fact, to have occurred almost as many\r\ntimes as the marvels are in number which I shall have to enumerate. If,\r\nindeed, all the buildings of our City are considered in the aggregate,\r\nand supposing them, so to say, all thrown together in one vast mass,\r\nthe united grandeur of them would lead one to suppose that we were\r\ndescribing another world, accumulated in a single spot.\r\n\r\nNot to mention among our great works, the Circus Maximus, that was\r\nconstructed by the Dictator Cæsar, one stadium in width and three in\r\nlength, and occupying, with the adjacent buildings, no less than four\r\njugera, with room for two hundred and sixty thousand spectators seated;\r\nam I not to include in the number of our magnificent constructions,\r\nthe Basilica of Paulus,[2624] with its admirable Phrygian columns;\r\nthe Forum of the late Emperor Augustus; the Temple of Peace, erected\r\nby the Emperor Vespasianus Augustus—some of the finest works that the\r\nworld has ever beheld—the roofing, too, of the Vote-Office,[2625] that\r\nwas built by Agrippa? not to forget that, before his time, Valerius of\r\nOstia, the architect, had covered in a theatre at Rome, at the time of\r\nthe public Games celebrated by Libo?[2626]\r\n\r\nWe behold with admiration pyramids that were built by kings, when the\r\nvery ground alone, that was purchased by the Dictator Cæsar, for the\r\nconstruction of his Forum, cost one hundred millions of sesterces! If,\r\ntoo, an enormous expenditure has its attractions for any one whose mind\r\nis influenced by monetary considerations, be it known to him that the\r\nhouse in which Clodius dwelt, who was slain by Milo, was purchased by\r\nhim at the price of fourteen million eight hundred thousand sesterces!\r\na thing that, for my part, I look upon as no less astounding than the\r\nmonstrous follies that have been displayed by kings. And then, as\r\nto Milo himself, the sums in which he was indebted, amounted to no\r\nless than seventy millions of sesterces; a state of things, to be\r\nconsidered, in my opinion, as one of the most portentous phænomena in\r\nthe history of the human mind. But it was in those days, too, that\r\nold men still spoke in admiration of the vast proportions of the\r\nAgger,[2627] and of the enormous foundations of the Capitol; of the\r\npublic sewers, too, a work more stupendous than any; as mountains had\r\nto be pierced for their construction, and, like the hanging city[2628]\r\nwhich we recently mentioned, navigation had to be carried on beneath\r\nRome; an event which happened in the ædileship[2629] of M. Agrippa,\r\nafter he had filled the office of consul.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, there are seven rivers, made, by artificial\r\nchannels, to flow beneath the city. Rushing onward, like so many\r\nimpetuous torrents, they are compelled to carry off and sweep away all\r\nthe sewerage; and swollen as they are by the vast accession of the\r\npluvial waters, they reverberate against the sides and bottom of their\r\nchannels. Occasionally, too, the Tiber, overflowing, is thrown backward\r\nin its course, and discharges itself by these outlets: obstinate is\r\nthe contest that ensues within between the meeting tides, but so firm\r\nand solid is the masonry, that it is enabled to offer an effectual\r\nresistance. Enormous as are the accumulations that are carried along\r\nabove, the work of the channels never gives way. Houses falling\r\nspontaneously to ruins, or levelled with the ground by conflagrations,\r\nare continually battering against them; the ground, too, is shaken by\r\nearthquakes every now and then; and yet, built as they were in the days\r\nof Tarquinius Priscus, seven hundred years ago, these constructions\r\nhave survived, all but unharmed. We must not omit, too, to mention\r\none remarkable circumstance, and all the more remarkable from the\r\nfact, that the most celebrated historians have omitted to mention it.\r\nTarquinius Priscus having commenced the sewers, and set the lower\r\nclasses to work upon them, the laboriousness and prolonged duration\r\nof the employment became equally an object of dread to them; and the\r\nconsequence was, that suicide was a thing of common occurrence, the\r\ncitizens adopting this method of escaping their troubles. For this\r\nevil, however, the king devised a singular remedy, and one that has\r\nnever[2630] been resorted to either before that time or since: for he\r\nordered the bodies of all who had been thus guilty of self-destruction,\r\nto be fastened to a cross, and left there as a spectacle to their\r\nfellow-citizens and a prey to birds and wild beasts. The result was,\r\nthat that sense of propriety which so peculiarly attaches itself to\r\nthe Roman name, and which more than once has gained a victory when the\r\nbattle was all but lost, came to the rescue on this occasion as well;\r\nthough for this once, the Romans were in reality its dupes, as they\r\nforgot that, though they felt shocked at the thoughts of such ignominy\r\nwhile alive, they would be quite insensible to any such disgrace when\r\ndead. It is said that Tarquinius made these sewers of dimensions\r\nsufficiently large to admit of a waggon laden with hay passing along\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll that we have just described, however, is but trifling when placed\r\nin comparison with one marvellous fact, which I must not omit to\r\nmention before I pass on to other subjects. In the consulship[2631] of\r\nM. Lepidus and Q. Catulus, there was not at Rome, as we learn from the\r\nmost trustworthy authors, a finer house than the one which belonged to\r\nLepidus himself: and yet, by Hercules! within five-and-thirty years\r\nfrom that period, the very same house did not hold the hundredth\r\nrank even in the City! Let a person, if he will, in taking this fact\r\ninto consideration, only calculate the vast masses of marble, the\r\nproductions of painters, the regal treasures that must have been\r\nexpended, in bringing these hundred mansions to vie with one that had\r\nbeen in its day the most sumptuous and the most celebrated in all the\r\nCity; and then let him reflect how that, since that period, and down\r\nto the present time, these houses have all of them been surpassed\r\nby others without number. There can be no doubt that conflagrations\r\nare a punishment inflicted upon us for our luxury; but such are our\r\nhabits, that in spite of such warnings as these, we cannot be made to\r\nunderstand that there are things in existence more perishable even than\r\nman himself.\r\n\r\nBut there are still two other mansions by which all these edifices\r\nhave been eclipsed. Twice have we seen the whole City environed by\r\nthe palaces of the Emperors Caius[2632] and Nero; that of the last,\r\nthat nothing might be wanting to its magnificence, being coated with\r\ngold.[2633] Surely such palaces as these must have been intended for\r\nthe abode of those who created this mighty empire, and who left the\r\nplough or their native hearth to go forth to conquer nations, and\r\nto return laden with triumphs! men, in fact, whose very fields even\r\noccupied less space than the audience-chambers[2634] of these palaces.\r\n\r\nIndeed, one cannot but help reflecting how trifling a portion of these\r\npalaces was equal to the sites which the republic granted to its\r\ninvincible generals, for the erection of their dwellings. The supreme\r\nhonour, too, attendant upon these grants—as in the case of P. Valerius\r\nPublicola, the first consul with L. Brutus, for his many meritorious\r\nservices; and of his brother, who twice in one consulship defeated the\r\nSabines—was the permission granted, by the terms of the decree, to have\r\nthe doors of their houses opening from without, and the gates thrown\r\nback upon the public street. Such was the most distinguished privilege\r\naccorded in those days to triumphal mansions even!\r\n\r\nI will not permit, however, these two Caiuses,[2635] or two Neros,\r\nto enjoy this glory even, such as it is; for I will prove that these\r\nextravagant follies of theirs have been surpassed, in the use that was\r\nmade of his wealth by M. Scaurus, a private citizen. Indeed, I am by\r\nno means certain that it was not the ædileship of this personage that\r\ninflicted the first great blow upon the public manners, and that Sylla\r\nwas not guilty of a greater crime in giving such unlimited power to his\r\nstep-son,[2636] than in the proscription of so many thousands. During\r\nhis ædileship, and only for the temporary purposes of a few days,\r\nScaurus executed the greatest[2637] work that has ever been made by\r\nthe hands of man, even when intended to be of everlasting duration;\r\nhis Theatre, I mean. This building consisted of three storeys,\r\nsupported upon three hundred and sixty columns; and this, too, in a\r\ncity which had not allowed without some censure one of its greatest\r\ncitizens[2638] to erect six[2639] pillars of Hymettian marble. The\r\nground-storey was of marble, the second of glass, a species of luxury\r\nwhich ever since that time has been quite unheard of, and the highest\r\nof gilded wood. The lowermost columns, as previously[2640] stated, were\r\neight-and-thirty feet in height; and, placed between these columns, as\r\nalready[2641] mentioned, were brazen statues, three thousand in number.\r\nThe area[2642] of this theatre afforded accommodation for eighty\r\nthousand spectators; and yet the Theatre of Pompeius, after the City\r\nhad so greatly increased, and the inhabitants had become so vastly more\r\nnumerous, was considered abundantly large, with its sittings for forty\r\nthousand only. The rest of the fittings of it, what with Attalic[2643]\r\nvestments, pictures, and the other stage-properties,[2644] were of such\r\nenormous value that, after Scaurus had had conveyed to his Tusculan\r\nvilla such parts thereof as were not required for the enjoyment of\r\nhis daily luxuries, the loss was no less than three hundred millions\r\nof sesterces, when the villa was burnt by his servants in a spirit of\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of such prodigality as this quite distracts my\r\nattention, and compels me to digress from my original purpose, in order\r\nto mention a still greater instance of extravagance, in reference\r\nto wood. C. Curio,[2645] who died during the civil wars, fighting\r\non the side of Cæsar, found, to his dismay, that he could not, when\r\ncelebrating the funeral games in honour of his father, surpass the\r\nriches and magnificence of Scaurus—for where, in fact, was to be found\r\nsuch a stepsire as Sylla, and such a mother as Metella, that bidder at\r\nall auctions for the property of the proscribed? Where, too, was he to\r\nfind for his father, M. Scaurus, so long the principal man in the city,\r\nand one who had acted, in his alliance with Marius, as a receptacle\r\nfor the plunder of whole provinces?—Indeed, Scaurus himself was now no\r\nlonger able to rival himself; and it was at least one advantage which\r\nhe derived from this destruction by fire of so many objects brought\r\nfrom all parts of the earth, that no one could ever after be his equal\r\nin this species of folly. Curio, consequently, found himself compelled\r\nto fall back upon his own resources, and to think of some new device of\r\nhis own. It is really worth our while to know what this device was, if\r\nonly to congratulate ourselves upon the manners of the present day, and\r\nto reverse the ordinary mode of expression, and term ourselves the men\r\nof the olden time.[2646]\r\n\r\nHe caused to be erected, close together, two theatres of very large\r\ndimensions, and built of wood, each of them nicely poised, and turning\r\non a pivot. Before mid-day, a spectacle of games was exhibited in each;\r\nthe theatres being turned back to back, in order that the noise of\r\nneither of them might interfere with what was going on in the other.\r\nThen, in the latter part of the day, all on a sudden, the two theatres\r\nwere swung round, and, the corners uniting, brought face to face; the\r\nouter frames,[2647] too, were removed, and thus an amphitheatre was\r\nformed, in which combats of gladiators were presented to the view; men\r\nwhose safety was almost less compromised than was that of the Roman\r\npeople, in allowing itself to be thus whirled round from side to side.\r\nNow, in this case, which have we most reason to admire, the inventor or\r\nthe invention? the artist, or the author of the project? him who first\r\ndared to think of such an enterprize, or him who ventured to undertake\r\nit? him who obeyed the order, or him who gave it? But the thing that\r\nsurpasses all is, the frenzy that must have possessed the public,\r\nto take their seats in a place which must of necessity have been so\r\nunsubstantial and so insecure. Lo and behold! here is a people that has\r\nconquered the whole earth, that has subdued the universe, that divides\r\nthe spoils of kingdoms and of nations, that sends its laws to foreign\r\nlands, that shares in some degree the attributes of the immortal gods\r\nin common with mankind, suspended aloft in a machine, and showering\r\nplaudits even upon its own peril!\r\n\r\nThis is indeed holding life cheap; and can we, after this, complain\r\nof our disasters at Cannæ? How vast the catastrophe that might have\r\nensued! When cities are swallowed up by an earthquake, it is looked\r\nupon by mankind as a general calamity; and yet, here have we the\r\nwhole Roman people, embarked, so to say, in two ships, and sitting\r\nsuspended on a couple of pivots; the grand spectacle being its own\r\nstruggle with danger, and its liability to perish at any moment that\r\nthe overstrained machinery may give way! And then the object, too, of\r\nall this—that public favour may be conciliated for the tribune’s[2648]\r\nharangues at a future day, and that, at the Rostra, he may still have\r\nthe power of shaking the tribes, nicely balanced[2649] as they are!\r\nAnd really, what may he not dare with those who, at his persuasion,\r\nhave braved such perils as these? Indeed, to confess the truth, at the\r\nfuneral games celebrated at the tomb of his father, it was no less than\r\nthe whole Roman people that shared the dangers of the gladiatorial\r\ncombats. When the pivots had now been sufficiently worked and wearied,\r\nhe gave another turn to his magnificent displays. For, upon the last\r\nday, still preserving the form of the amphitheatre, he cut the stage\r\nin two through the middle, and exhibited a spectacle of athletes;\r\nafter which, the stage being suddenly withdrawn on either side, he\r\nexhibited a combat, upon the same day, between such of the gladiators\r\nas had previously proved victorious. And yet, with all this, Curio\r\nwas no king, no ruler of the destinies of a nation, nor yet a person\r\nremarkable for his opulence even; seeing that he possessed no resources\r\nof his own, beyond what he could realize from the discord between the\r\nleading men.[2650]\r\n\r\nBut let us now turn our attention to some marvels which, justly\r\nappreciated, may be truthfully pronounced to remain unsurpassed. Q.\r\nMarcius Rex,[2651] upon being commanded by the senate to repair the\r\nAppian[2652] Aqueduct, and those of the Anio[2653] and Tepula,[2654]\r\nconstructed during his prætorship a new aqueduct,[2655] which bore his\r\nname, and was brought hither by a channel pierced through the sides of\r\nmountains. Agrippa,[2656] in his ædileship, united the Marcian with\r\nthe Virgin[2657] Aqueduct, and repaired and strengthened the channels\r\nof the others. He also formed seven hundred wells, in addition to five\r\nhundred fountains, and one hundred and thirty reservoirs, many of them\r\nmagnificently adorned. Upon these works, too, he erected three hundred\r\nstatues of marble or bronze, and four hundred marble columns; and all\r\nthis in the space of a single year! In the work[2658] which he has\r\nwritten in commemoration of his ædileship, he also informs us that\r\npublic games were celebrated for the space of fifty-nine days, and that\r\none hundred and seventy gratuitous baths were opened. The number of\r\nthese last at Rome, has increased to an infinite[2659] extent since his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe preceding aqueducts, however, have all been surpassed by the costly\r\nwork which was more recently commenced by the Emperor Caius,[2660] and\r\ncompleted by Claudius. Under these princes, the Curtian and Cærulean\r\nWaters, with the New Anio,[2661] were brought from a distance of forty\r\nmiles, and at so high a level that all the hills were supplied with\r\nwater, on which the City is built. The sum expended on these works was\r\nthree hundred and fifty millions of sesterces. If we only take into\r\nconsideration the abundant supply of water to the public, for baths,\r\nponds, canals, household purposes, gardens, places in the suburbs, and\r\ncountry-houses; and then reflect upon the distances that are traversed,\r\nthe arches that have been constructed, the mountains that have been\r\npierced, the valleys that have been levelled, we must of necessity\r\nadmit that there is nothing to be found more worthy of our admiration\r\nthroughout the whole universe.\r\n\r\nAmong the most memorable works, too, I, for my own part, should\r\ninclude another undertaking of the Emperor Claudius, although it was\r\nafterwards abandoned in consequence of the hatred borne him by his\r\nsuccessor;[2662] I mean the channel that was cut through a mountain as\r\nan emissary for Lake Fucinus;[2663] a work which cost a sum beyond all\r\ncalculation, and employed a countless multitude of workmen for many\r\nyears. In those parts where the soil was found to be terreous, it was\r\nnecessary to pump up the water by the aid of machinery; in other parts,\r\nagain, the solid rock had to be hewn through. All this, too, had to be\r\ndone in the midst of darkness within; a series of operations which can\r\nonly be adequately conceived by those who were witnesses of them, and\r\nwhich no human language can possibly describe.\r\n\r\nI pass in silence the harbour that has been formed at Ostia; the\r\nvarious roads, too, that have been cut across mountains; the Tyrrhenian\r\nSea separated by an embankment from Lake Lucrinus;[2664] and vast\r\nnumbers of bridges constructed at an enormous expense. Among the many\r\nother marvels, too, of Italy, we are informed by Papirius Fabianus,\r\na most diligent enquirer into the operations of Nature, that the\r\nmarble there grows in the quarries; and those who work in the quarries\r\nassure us that the wounds thus inflicted upon the mountains fill up\r\nspontaneously. If such is the fact, luxury has good grounds for hoping\r\nthat it will never be at a loss for a supply of materials for its\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (16.)—THE MAGNET: THREE REMEDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon quitting the marbles to pass on to the other more remarkable\r\nstones, who can for a moment doubt that the magnet[2665] will be the\r\nfirst to suggest itself? For what, in fact, is there endowed with\r\nmore marvellous properties than this? or in which of her departments\r\nhas Nature displayed a greater degree of waywardness? She had given a\r\nvoice to rocks, as already[2666] mentioned, and had enabled them to\r\nanswer man, or rather, I should say, to throw back his own words in\r\nhis teeth. What is there in existence more inert than a piece of rigid\r\nstone? And yet, behold! Nature has here endowed stone with both sense\r\nand hands. What is there more stubborn than hard iron? Nature has, in\r\nthis instance, bestowed upon it both feet and intelligence. It allows\r\nitself, in fact, to be attracted by the magnet, and, itself a metal\r\nwhich subdues all other elements, it precipitates itself towards the\r\nsource of an influence at once mysterious and unseen. The moment the\r\nmetal comes near it, it springs towards the magnet, and, as it clasps\r\nit, is held fast in the magnet’s embraces. Hence it is that this stone\r\nis sometimes known by the name of “sideritis;”[2667] another name given\r\nto it being “heraclion.”[2668] It received its name “magnes,” Nicander\r\ninforms us, from the person who was the first to discover it, upon\r\nIda.[2669] It is found, too, in various other countries, as in Spain,\r\nfor example. Magnes, it is said, made this discovery, when, upon taking\r\nhis herds to pasture, he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron\r\nferrel of his staff adhered to the ground.\r\n\r\nSotacus[2670] describes five[2671] different kinds of magnet; the\r\nÆthiopian magnet; that of Magnesia, a country which borders on\r\nMacedonia, and lies to the right of the road which leads from, the town\r\nof Bœbe to Iolcos; a third, from Hyettus in Bœotia; a fourth, from\r\nAlexandria in Troas; and a fifth, from Magnesia in Asia. The leading\r\ndistinction in magnets is the sex, male and female,[2672] and the next\r\ngreat difference in them is the colour. Those of Magnesia, bordering on\r\nMacedonia, are of a reddish black; those of Bœotia are more red than\r\nblack; and the kind that is found in Troas is black, of the female sex,\r\nand consequently destitute of attractive power. The most inferior,\r\nhowever, of all, are those of Magnesia in Asia: they are white, have no\r\nattractive influence on iron, and resemble pumice in appearance. It has\r\nbeen found by experience, that the more nearly the magnet approaches\r\nto an azure colour, the better it is in quality. The Æthiopian magnet\r\nis looked upon as the best of all, and is purchased at its weight in\r\nsilver: Zmiris in Æthiopia is the place where it is found, such being\r\nthe name of a region there, covered with sand.\r\n\r\nIn the same country, too, the magnet called “hæmatites”[2673] is\r\nfound, a stone of a blood-red colour, and which, when bruised, yields\r\na tint like that of blood, as also of saffron. The hæmatites has not\r\nthe same property[2674] of attracting iron that the ordinary magnet\r\nhas. The Æthiopian magnet is recognized by this peculiarity, that it\r\nhas the property, also, of attracting other magnets to it.[2675] All\r\nthese minerals are useful as ingredients in ophthalmic preparations,\r\nin certain proportions according to the nature of each: they are\r\nparticularly good, too, for arresting defluxions of the eyes.\r\nTriturated in a calcined state, they have a healing effect upon burns.\r\n\r\nIn Æthiopia, too, not far from Zmiris, there is a mountain in which the\r\nstone called “theamedes”[2676] is found, a mineral which repels and\r\nrejects all kinds of iron. Of the attractive and repulsive properties\r\nof iron, we have spoken[2677] more than once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—STONE OF SCYROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Isle of Scyros[2678] there is a stone,[2679] they say, which\r\nfloats upon water when whole, but which falls to the bottom when broken\r\ninto fragments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27. (17.)—SARCOPHAGUS, OR STONE OF ASSOS: TEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Assos in Troas, there is found a stone of a laminated texture,\r\ncalled “sarcophagus.”[2680] It is a well-known fact, that dead bodies,\r\nwhen buried in this stone, are consumed in the course of forty days,\r\nwith the sole exception of the teeth. According to Mucianus, too,\r\nmirrors, body-scrapers, garments, and shoes, that have been buried with\r\nthe dead, become transformed into stone. In Lycia, and in the East,\r\nthere are certain stones of a similar nature, which, when attached to\r\nthe bodies of the living even, corrode the flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—CHERNITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLess active in its properties is chernites,[2681] a stone which\r\npreserves bodies without consuming them, and strongly resembles ivory\r\nin appearance: the body of King Darius, they say, was buried in it.\r\nThe stone that is known as “porus,”[2681] is similar to Parian marble\r\nin hardness and whiteness, but is not so heavy. Theophrastus mentions\r\nalso a transparent stone that is found in Egypt, and is similar to\r\nstone of Chios in appearance; it is by no means improbable that it\r\nmay have existed in his time, for stones, we know, disappear, and new\r\nkinds are discovered. The stone of Assos,[2682] which is saltish to the\r\ntaste, modifies the attacks of gout, the feet being placed in a vessel\r\nmade of it for the purpose; in addition to which, in the quarries of\r\nthis stone, all maladies of the legs disappear, whereas, in mines in\r\ngeneral, the legs become affected with disease. “Flower of stone of\r\nAssos” is the name given to a soft stone which crumbles into dust, and\r\nis found very efficacious in some cases; it resembles red pumice in\r\nappearance. In combination with Cyprian wax, this stone is curative\r\nof affections of the mamillæ; and, employed with pitch or resin, it\r\ndisperses scrofulous sores and inflammatory tumours. Used in the form\r\nof an electuary, it is good for phthisis, and, with honey, it causes\r\nold sores to cicatrize, and consumes proud flesh. It is used, also, for\r\nthe cure of wounds of an obstinate nature inflicted by animals, and\r\nacts as a desiccative upon suppurations. Plaisters, too, are made of it\r\nfor gout, bean-meal being incorporated with it for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29. (18.)—OSSEOUS STONES. PALM STONES. CORANI. BLACK STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheophrastus and Mucianus are of opinion that there are certain stones\r\nwhich bring[2683] forth other stones. Theophrastus states, also, that\r\na fossil[2684] ivory is found, both white and black; that the earth,\r\ntoo, produces bones, and that osseous[2685] stones are sometimes found.\r\nIn the vicinity of Munda in Spain, the place where the Dictator Cæsar\r\ndefeated Pompeius,[2686] there are stones found, which, when broken\r\nasunder, bear the impression of palm leaves.[2687]\r\n\r\nThere are some black stones, also, which are held in much the same\r\nesteem as the marbles; the Tænarian[2688] stone, for example. Varro\r\nsays that the black stone of Africa is more durable than that of Italy;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the white corani[2689] are harder than Parian\r\nmarble. He states, also, that the silex of Luna admits of being cut\r\nwith a saw; that that of Tusculum decrepitates in the fire; that the\r\ntawny silex of the Sabine districts, with the addition of oil, will\r\nyield a flame even; and that, at Volsinii, molar stones[2690] for\r\ngrinding are found. Among the prodigies that have happened, I find\r\nmention made of millstones that have moved of themselves,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—MOLAR STONES. PYRITES; SEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no country are the molar stones[2691] superior to those of Italy;\r\nstones, be it remembered, and not fragments of rock: there are some\r\nprovinces, too, where they are not to be found at all. Some stones of\r\nthis class are softer than others, and admit of being smoothed with\r\nthe whetstone, so as to present all the appearance, at a distance, of\r\nophites.[2692] There is no stone of a more durable nature than this;\r\nfor in general, stone, like wood, suffers from the action, more or\r\nless, of rain, heat, and cold. Some kinds, again, become deteriorated\r\nby the action of the moon, while others are apt to contract a rust in\r\nlapse of time, or to change their white colour when steeped in oil.\r\n\r\n(19.) Some persons give this molar stone the name of “pyrites,”[2693]\r\nfrom the circumstance that it has a great affinity to fire;[2694] but\r\nthere is also another kind of pyrites, of a more porous nature, and\r\nanother,[2695] again, which resembles copper. This last, it is said,\r\nis found in the mines, near Acamas,[2696] in the Isle of Cyprus; one\r\nvariety of it being of a silver, another of a golden, colour. There\r\nare various methods of melting these stones, some persons fusing\r\nthem twice, or three times even, in honey, till all the liquid has\r\nevaporated; while others, again, calcine them upon hot coals, and,\r\nafter treating them with honey, wash them like copper.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal properties which these minerals possess are of a\r\ncalorific, desiccative, dispersive, and resolvent nature, and, applied\r\ntopically, they case indurations to suppurate. They are employed also,\r\nin a crude state and pulverized, for the cure of scrofulous sores\r\nand boils. Some writers mention another kind of pyrites also. Those\r\namong them have the greatest affinity to fire which we distinguish as\r\n“live”[2697] pyrites. They are the most ponderous of all, and are found\r\nremarkably useful for advance-guards when laying out encampments; for,\r\non being struck with a nail or any other kind of stone, they emit a\r\nspark, which, received upon sulphur, dried fungus,[2698] or leaves,\r\nproduces a fire almost sooner than it could be named.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—OSTRACITES; FOUR REMEDIES. AMIANTHUS; TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe several varieties of ostracites[2699] bear a resemblance to shells.\r\nThey are used by way of substitute for pumice-stone, for smoothing the\r\nskin. Taken in drink, they arrest discharges of blood; and, applied\r\ntopically with honey, they are curative of ulcerations and pains in the\r\nmamillæ.\r\n\r\nAmianthus[2700] resembles alumen[2701] in appearance, and suffers\r\nno diminution from the action of fire. This substance effectually\r\ncounteracts all noxious spells, those wrought by magicians in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32.—GEODES; THREE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeodes[2702] is so called from its formation, it containing earth\r\nwithin. It is remarkably beneficial for the eyes, and is used for the\r\ncure of diseases of the testes and mamillæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—MELITINUS; SIX REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone called “melitinus”[2703] yields a liquid that is sweet, like\r\nhoney. Bruised and incorporated with wax, it is curative of pituitous\r\neruptions, spots upon the skin, and ulcerations of the fauces. It\r\nremoves epinyctis[2704] also, and, applied as a pessary, in wool, it\r\nalleviates pains in the uterus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—GAGATES: SIX REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGagates[2705] is a stone, so called from Gages, the name of a town\r\nand river in Lycia.[2706] It is asserted, too, that at Leucolla[2707]\r\nthe sea throws it up, and that it is found over a space twelve stadia\r\nin extent. It is black, smooth, light, and porous, differs but little\r\nfrom wood in appearance,[2708] is of a brittle texture, and emits a\r\ndisagreeable odour[2709] when rubbed. Marks made upon pottery with\r\nthis stone cannot be effaced. When burnt, it gives out a sulphureous\r\nsmell; and it is a singular fact, that the application of water ignites\r\nit, while that of oil quenches it.[2710] The fumes of it, burnt, keep\r\nserpents at a distance, and dispel hysterical affections: they detect a\r\ntendency also to epilepsy,[2711] and act as a test of virginity.[2712]\r\nA decoction of this stone in wine is curative of tooth-ache; and,\r\nin combination with wax, it is good for scrofula. The magicians,\r\nit is said, make use of gagates in the practice of what they call\r\naxinomancy;[2713] and they assure us that it will be sure not to burn,\r\nif the thing is about to happen as the party desires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—SPONGITES: TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone called “spongites” is found in sponges, and is a marine\r\nformation. By some persons it is called “tecolithos,”[2714] from the\r\ncircumstance that it is curative of affections of the bladder. Taken in\r\nwine, it breaks and disperses urinary calculi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—PHRYGIAN STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhrygian stone is so called from the country which produces it, and\r\nis a porous mass like pumice. It is first saturated with wine, and\r\nthen calcined, the fire being kept up with the bellows till the stone\r\nis brought to a red heat; which done, it is quenched in sweet wine.\r\nThis operation is repeated three times. The only use made of it is for\r\ndyeing cloths.[2715]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37. (20.)—HÆMATITES: FIVE REMEDIES. SCHISTOS: SEVEN REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchistos and hæmatites[2716] have a certain affinity between them. The\r\nlatter is found in mines, and, when burnt, has just the colour[2717]\r\nof minium.[2718] It is calcined in the same manner as Phrygian stone,\r\nbut is not quenched in wine. Adulterations of it are detected by the\r\nappearance of red veins in it, and by its comparative friability.\r\nIt is marvellously useful as an application for bloodshot eyes,\r\nand, taken internally, it acts as a check upon female discharges.\r\nTo patients vomiting blood, it is administered in combination with\r\npomegranate-juice. It is very efficacious also for affections of the\r\nbladder; and it is taken with wine for the cure of wounds inflicted\r\nby serpents. In all those cases the stone called “schistos”[2719] is\r\nefficacious, though not in so high a degree as the other; the most\r\nserviceable being that which resembles saffron in colour. Applied with\r\nwoman’s milk, it is particularly useful for arresting discharges from\r\nthe corners of the eyes,[2720] and it is also very serviceable for\r\nreducing procidence of those organs. Such, at least, is the opinion of\r\nthe authors who have most recently written on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—ÆTHIOPIC HÆMATITES. ANDRODAMAS; TWO REMEDIES. ARABIAN\r\nHÆMATITES. MILTITES OR HEPATITES. ANTHRACITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSotacus, one of the most ancient writers, says, that there are five\r\nkinds of hæmatites, in addition to the magnet[2721] so called. He\r\ngives the preference among them to that of Æthiopia,[2722] a very\r\nuseful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations and the compositions\r\nwhich he calls “panchresta,”[2723] and good for the cure of burns.\r\nThe second, he says, is called “androdamas,”[2724] of a black[2725]\r\ncolour, remarkable for its weight and hardness, to which it owes its\r\nname, in fact, and found in Africa more particularly. It attracts\r\nsilver, he says, copper, and iron, and is tested with a touchstone\r\nmade of basanites.[2726] It yields a liquid the colour of blood, and\r\nis an excellent remedy for diseases of the liver. The third kind that\r\nhe mentions is the hæmatites[2727] of Arabia, a mineral of equal\r\nhardness, and which with difficulty yields, upon the water-whetstone,\r\na liquid sometimes approaching the tint of saffron. The fourth[2728]\r\nkind, he says, is known as “hepatites,”[2729] while raw, and as\r\n“miltites”[2730] when calcined; a substance good for burns, and more\r\nefficacious than rubrica[2731] for all the purposes for which that\r\nmineral is employed. The fifth[2732] variety is schistos; a substance\r\nwhich, taken internally, arrests hæmorrhoidal discharges. Upon the same\r\nauthority, it is recommended to take any kind of hæmatites, fasting,\r\nin doses of three drachmæ, triturated in oil, for affections of the\r\nblood.[2733]\r\n\r\nThe same author mentions also a kind of schistos which has no affinity\r\nto hæmatites, and to which he gives the name of “anthracites.”[2734] It\r\nis a native of Africa, he says, and is of a black colour. When rubbed\r\nupon a water-whetstone, it yields a black colour on the side which has\r\nadhered to the earth, and, on the opposite side, a saffron tint. He\r\nstates also that it is a useful ingredient in ophthalmic preparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39. (21)—AËTITES. TAPHIUSIAN STONE. CALLIMUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone called aëtites[2735] has a great reputation, in consequence\r\nof the name which it bears. It is found in the nests of eagles, as\r\nalready mentioned in our Tenth Book.[2736] There are always two of\r\nthese stones found together, they say, a male stone and a female; and\r\nwithout them, it is said, the various eagles that we have described\r\nwould be unable to propagate. Hence it is, too, that the young of the\r\neagle are never more than two in number. There are four varieties of\r\nthe aëtites: that of Africa is soft and diminutive, and contains in the\r\ninterior—in its bowels as it were—a sweet, white, argillaceous earth.\r\nIt is friable, and is generally thought to be of the female sex. The\r\nmale stone, on the other hand, which is found in Arabia, is hard, and\r\nsimilar to a nut-gall in appearance; or else of a reddish hue, with a\r\nhard stone in the interior. The third kind is a stone found in the Isle\r\nof Cyprus, and resembles those of Africa in appearance, but is larger\r\nand flat, while the others are of a globular form: it contains a sand\r\nwithin, of a pleasing colour, and mixed with small stones; being so\r\nsoft itself as to admit of being crushed between the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe fourth variety is known as the Taphiusian aëtites, and is found\r\nnear Leucas,[2737] at Taphiusa, a locality which lies to the right as\r\nyou sail from Ithaca towards Cape Leucas. It is met with in the beds\r\nof rivers there, and is white and round; having another stone in the\r\ninterior, the name given to which is “callimus:” none of the varieties\r\nof aëtites have a smoother surface than this. Attached to pregnant\r\nwomen or to cattle, in the skins of animals that have been sacrificed,\r\nthese stones act as a preventive of abortion, care being taken not to\r\nremove them till the moment of parturition; for otherwise procidence of\r\nthe uterus is the result. If, on the other hand, they are not removed\r\nat the moment when parturition is about to ensue, that operation of\r\nNature cannot be effected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—SAMIAN STONE: EIGHT REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamian stone[2738] comes from the same island which produces the\r\nearth in praise of which we have spoken already.[2739] It is useful\r\nfor giving a polish to gold, and it is employed medicinally for the\r\ntreatment of ulcerations of the eyes, combined with milk in manner\r\nalready[2740] described. It is good, too, for watery discharges of\r\na chronic nature, from the eyes. Taken internally, it is useful for\r\naffections of the stomach, and it has the effect of dispelling vertigo\r\nand restoring the spirits when depressed. Some writers are of opinion\r\nthat this stone may be administered with advantage for epilepsy and\r\nstrangury; and it is employed as an ingredient in the restoratives\r\nknown as “acopa.”[2741] The test of its purity is its weight and its\r\nwhiteness. Some persons will have it that, worn as an amulet, it acts\r\nas a preventive of abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—ARABIAN STONE; SIX REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nArabian[2742] stone resembles ivory in appearance; and in a calcined\r\nstate it is employed as a dentifrice.[2743] It is particularly useful\r\nfor the cure of hæmorrhoidal swellings, applied either in lint or by\r\nthe aid of linen pledgets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—PUMICE; NINE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here, too, I must not omit to give some account of pumice.[2744]\r\nThis name is very generally given, it is true, to those porous\r\npieces of stone, which we see suspended in the erections known as\r\n“musæa,”[2745] with the view of artificially giving them all the\r\nappearance of caverns. But the genuine pumice-stones, that are in use\r\nfor imparting smoothness to the skin of females, and not females only,\r\nbut men as well, and, as Catullus[2746] says, for polishing books, are\r\nfound of the finest quality in the islands of Melos and Nisyros[2747]\r\nand in the Æolian Isles. To be good, they should be white, as light as\r\npossible, porous and dry in the extreme, friable, and free from sand\r\nwhen rubbed.\r\n\r\nConsidered medicinally, pumice is of a resolvent and desiccative\r\nnature; for which purpose it is submitted to calcination, no less than\r\nthree times, on a fire of pure charcoal, it being quenched as often\r\nin white wine. It is then washed, like cadmia,[2748] and, after being\r\ndried, is put by for keeping, in a place as free from damp as possible.\r\nIn a powdered state, pumice is used in ophthalmic preparations more\r\nparticularly, and acts as a lenitive detergent upon ulcerations\r\nof the eyes. It also makes new flesh upon cicatrizations of those\r\norgans, and removes all traces of the marks. Some prefer, after the\r\nthird calcination, leaving the pumice to cool, and then triturating\r\nit in wine. It is employed also as an ingredient in emollient\r\npoultices, being extremely useful for ulcerations on the head and\r\ngenerative organs; dentifrices, too, are prepared from it. According\r\nto Theophrastus,[2749] persons when drinking for a wager are in the\r\nhabit[2750] of taking powdered pumice first; but they run great risk,\r\nhe says, if they fail to swallow the whole draught of wine at once;\r\nit being of so refrigerative a nature that grape-juice[2751] will\r\nabsolutely cease to boil if pumice is put into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43. (22.)—STONES FOR MORTARS USED FOR MEDICINAL AND OTHER\r\nPURPOSES. ETESIAN STONE. THEBAIC STONE. CHALAZIAN STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors, too, have paid some attention to the stones in use for\r\nmortars, not only those employed for the trituration of drugs and\r\npigments, but for other purposes as well. In this respect they have\r\ngiven the preference to Etesian[2752] stone before all others, and,\r\nnext to that, to Thebaic stone, already mentioned[2753] as being\r\ncalled “pyrrhopœcilon,” and known as “psaranus” by some. The third\r\nrank has been assigned to chrysites,[2754] a stone nearly allied to\r\nChalazian[2755] stone. For medicinal purposes, however, basanites[2756]\r\nhas been preferred, this being a stone that remits no particles from\r\nits surface.[2757]\r\n\r\nThose stones which yield a liquid, are generally looked upon as good\r\nfor the trituration of ophthalmic preparations; and hence it is, that\r\nthe Æthiopian stone is so much in request for the purpose. Tænarian\r\nstone, they say, Phœnician stone, and hæmatites, are good for the\r\npreparation of those medicinal compositions in which saffron forms\r\nan ingredient; but they also speak of another Tænarian stone, of a\r\ndark colour, which, like Parian[2758] stone, is not so well adapted\r\nfor medicinal purposes. We learn from them, too, that Egyptian\r\nalabastrites,[2759] or white ophites,[2760] from the virtues inherent\r\nin them, are considered still better adapted for these purposes than\r\nthe kinds last mentioned. It is this kind of ophites, too, from which\r\nvessels, and casks even, are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—STONE OF SIPHNOS. SOFT STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Siphnos,[2761] there is a kind of stone[2762] which is hollowed\r\nand turned in the lathe, for making cooking-utensils and vessels for\r\nkeeping provisions; a thing too, that, to my own knowledge,[2763]\r\nis done with the green stone[2764] of Comum[2765] in Italy. With\r\nreference, however, to the stone of Siphnos, it is a singular fact,\r\nthat, when heated in oil, though naturally very soft, it becomes hard\r\nand black; so great a difference is there in the qualities of stone.\r\n\r\nThere are some remarkable instances, too, beyond the Alps, of the\r\nnatural softness of some kinds of stone. In the province of the Belgæ,\r\nthere is a white stone[2766] which admits of being cut with the saw\r\nthat is used for wood, and with greater facility even. This stone is\r\nused as a substitute for roof-tiles and gutter-tiles, and even for\r\nthe kind of roofing known as the pavonaceous[2767] style, if that is\r\npreferred. Such are the stones that admit of being cut into thin slabs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—SPECULAR STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to specular[2768] stone—for this, too, is ranked as one of the\r\nstones—it admits of being divided with still greater facility, and can\r\nbe split into leaves as thin as may be desired. The province of Nearer\r\nSpain used formerly to be the only one that furnished it—not, indeed,\r\nthe whole of that country, but a district extending for a hundred miles\r\naround the city of Segobrica.[2769] But at the present day, Cyprus,\r\nCappadocia, and Sicily, supply us with it; and, still more recently,\r\nit has been discovered in Africa: they are all, however, looked upon\r\nas inferior to the stone which comes from Spain. The sheets from\r\nCappadocia are the largest in size; but then they are clouded. This\r\nstone is to be found also in the territory of Bononia,[2770] in Italy;\r\nbut in small pieces only, covered with spots and encrusted in a bed of\r\nsilex, there being a considerable affinity, it would appear, in their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, the specular-stone is extracted from shafts sunk in the\r\nearth to a very considerable depth; though it is occasionally to\r\nbe found just beneath the surface, enclosed in the solid rock, and\r\nextracted without difficulty, or else cut away from its bed. In most\r\ncases, however, it admits of being dug up, being of an isolated\r\nnature, and lying in pieces, like rag-stone, but never known as yet\r\nto exceed five feet in length. It would appear that this substance\r\nis originally a liquid, which, by an animating power in the earth,\r\nbecomes congealed like crystal; and it is very evident that it is the\r\nresult of petrifaction, from the fact that, when animals have fallen\r\ninto the shafts from which it is extracted, the marrow of their bones\r\nbecomes transformed into stone of a similar nature, by the end of a\r\nsingle winter. In some cases, too, it is found of a black colour: but\r\nthe white stone has the marvellous property, soft as it is known to be,\r\nof resisting the action of the sun and of cold. Nor will it, if it is\r\nonly protected from accidents, become deteriorated by lapse of time, a\r\nthing that is so generally the case with many other kinds of stone that\r\nare used for building purposes. The shavings, too, and scales of this\r\nstone, have been used of late for another purpose; the Circus Maximus\r\nhaving been strewed with them at the celebration of the games, with the\r\nobject of producing an agreeable whiteness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—PHENGITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Nero, there was a stone found in Cappadocia, as\r\nhard as marble, white, and transparent even in those parts where red\r\nveins were to be seen upon it; a property which has obtained for it\r\nthe name of “phengites.”[2771] It was with this stone[2772] that\r\nNero rebuilt the Temple of Fortune, surnamed Seia,[2773] originally\r\nconsecrated by King Servius, enclosing it within the precincts of\r\nhis Golden Palace.[2774] Hence it was that, even when the doors were\r\nclosed, there was light in the interior during the day; not transmitted\r\nfrom without, as would be the case through a medium of specular-stone,\r\nbut having all the appearance of being enclosed within[2775] the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nIn Arabia, too, according to Juba, there is a stone, transparent like\r\nglass, which is used for the same purposes as specular-stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—WHETSTONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now pass on to the stones that are employed for handicrafts,\r\nand, first of all, whetstones for sharpening iron. Of these stones\r\nthere are numerous varieties; the Cretan stones having been long held\r\nin the highest estimation, and the next best being those of Mount\r\nTaygetus, in Laconia; both of which are used as hones, and require oil.\r\nAmong the water-whetstones, the first rank belonged to those of Naxos,\r\nand the second to the stones of Armenia, both of them already[2776]\r\nmentioned. The stones of Cilicia are of excellent quality, whether used\r\nwith oil or with water; those of Arsinöe,[2777] too, are very good, but\r\nwith water only. Whetstones have been found also in Italy, which with\r\nwater give a remarkably keen edge; and from the countries beyond the\r\nAlps, we have the whetstones known as “passernices.”[2778]\r\n\r\nTo the fourth class belong the hones which give an edge by the agency\r\nof human saliva, and are much in use in barbers’ shops. They are\r\nworthless, however, for all other purposes, in consequence of their\r\nsoft and brittle nature: those from the district of Laminium,[2779] in\r\nNearer Spain, are the best of the kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—TOPHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the multitude of stones which still remain undescribed, there\r\nis tophus;[2780] material totally unsuited for building purposes, in\r\nconsequence of its perishableness. Still, however, there are some\r\nlocalities which have no other, Carthage, in Africa, for example. It\r\nis eaten away by the emanations from the sea, crumbled to dust by the\r\nwind, and shattered by the pelting of the rain: but human industry\r\nhas found the means of protecting walls of houses built of it, with\r\na coating of pitch, as a plaster of lime would corrode it. Hence it\r\nis, that we have the well-known saying, “that the Carthaginians use\r\npitch[2781] for their houses and lime[2782] for their wines,” this last\r\nbeing the method used by them in the preparation of their must.\r\n\r\nIn the territories of Fidenæ and Alba, in the vicinity of Rome, we\r\nfind other soft kinds of stone; and, in Umbria and Venetia, there\r\nis a stone[2783] which admits of being cut with the teeth of a saw.\r\nThese stones are easy to be worked, and are capable of supporting a\r\nconsiderable weight, if they are only kept sheltered from the weather.\r\nRain, however, frost, and dew, split them to pieces, nor can they\r\nresist the humidity of the sea-air. The stone[2784] of Tibur can stand\r\neverything except heat, which makes it crack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SILEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe black silex[2785] is in general the best; but in some localities,\r\nit is the red, and occasionally the white; as in the Anician quarries\r\nat Tarquinii, near Lake Volsinius,[2786] for example, and those at\r\nStatonia,[2787] the stone of which is proof against fire even.[2788]\r\nThese stones, sculptured for monumental purposes, are subject to no\r\ndeterioration by lapse of time: moulds, too, are made from them, for\r\nthe purpose of fusing copper. There is a green silex, also, which\r\noffers a most powerful resistance to the action of fire, but is never\r\nfound in any large quantities, and, in all cases, in an isolated form,\r\nand not as a constituent part of solid rock. Of the other kinds, the\r\npale silex is but rarely used for erections: being of globular form,\r\nit is not liable to injury, but at the same time it is insecure for\r\nbuilding purposes, unless it is well braced and tightly held together.\r\nNor yet does river silex offer any greater security, for it always has\r\nthe appearance of being wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—OTHER STONES USED FOR BUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the nature of stone is doubtful, the proper precaution is, to\r\nquarry it in summer, and not to use it for building before the end of a\r\ncouple of years, leaving it in the meantime to be well seasoned by the\r\nweather. The slabs which have been damaged will be found to be better\r\nsuited for the foundations under ground: while those, on the other\r\nhand, which have remained uninjured, may be employed with safety, and\r\nexposed to the open air even.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—THE VARIOUS METHODS OF BUILDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks construct party-walls, resembling those of brickwork, of\r\nhard stone or of silex, squared. This kind of stonework is what they\r\ncall “isodomon,”[2789] it being ” pseudisodomon”[2790] when the wall\r\nis built of materials of unequal dimensions. A third kind of stonework\r\nis called “emplecton,”[2791] the two exteriors only being made with\r\nregularity, the rest of the material being thrown in at random. It is\r\nnecessary that the stones should lie over one another alternately, in\r\nsuch a way that the middle of one stone meets the point of junction\r\nof the two below it; and this, too, in the middle of the wall, if\r\npossible; but if not, at all events, at the sides. When the middle\r\nof the wall is filled up with broken stones, the work is known as\r\n“diatoichon.”[2792]\r\n\r\nThe reticulated[2793] kind of building, which is mostly in use at Rome,\r\nis very liable to crack.[2794] All building should be done by line and\r\nrule, and ought to be strictly on the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52. (23.)—CISTERNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCisterns should be made of five parts of pure, gravelly, sand, two of\r\nthe very strongest quicklime, and fragments of silex not exceeding a\r\npound each in weight; when thus incorporated, the bottom and sides\r\nshould be well beaten with iron rammers. The best plan, too, is to have\r\nthe cisterns double; so that all superfluities may settle in the inner\r\ncistern, and the water filter through, as pure as possible, into the\r\nouter one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—QUICK-LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCato[2795] the Censor disapproves of lime prepared from stones of\r\nvarious colours: that made of white stone is the best. Lime prepared\r\nfrom hard stone is the best for building purposes, and that from\r\nporous stone for coats of plaster. For both these purposes, lime made\r\nfrom silex is equally rejected. Stone that has been extracted from\r\nquarries furnishes a better lime than that collected from the beds\r\nof rivers; but the best of all is the lime that is obtained from the\r\nmolar-stone,[2796] that being of a more unctuous nature than the\r\nothers. It is something truly marvellous, that quick-lime, after the\r\nstone has been subjected to fire, should ignite on the application of\r\nwater!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF SAND. THE COMBINATIONS OF SAND WITH LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of sand: fossil[2797] sand, to which one-fourth\r\npart of lime should be added;[2798] river sand; and sea sand; to both\r\nof which last, one third of lime should be added. If, too, one third\r\nof the mortar is composed of bruised earthenware, it will be all the\r\nbetter. Fossil sand is found in the districts that lie between the\r\nApennines and the Padus, but not in the parts beyond sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—DEFECTS IN BUILDING. PLASTERS FOR WALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great cause of the fall of so many buildings in our City, is, that\r\nthrough a fraudulent abstraction of the lime, the rough work is laid\r\nwithout anything to hold it together. The older, too, the mortar is,\r\nthe better it is in quality. In the ancient laws for the regulation of\r\nbuilding, no contractor was to use mortar less than three months old;\r\nhence it is, that no cracks have disfigured the plaster coatings of\r\ntheir walls. These stuccos will never present a sufficiently bright\r\nsurface, unless there have been three layers of sanded mortar, and\r\ntwo of marbled[2799] mortar upon that. In damp localities and places\r\nsubject to exhalations from the sea, it is the best plan to substitute\r\nground earthenware mortar for sanded mortar. In Greece, it is the\r\npractice, first to pound the lime and sand used for plastering, with\r\nwooden pestles in a large trough. The test by which it is known that\r\nmarbled mortar has been properly blended, is its not adhering to the\r\ntrowel; whereas, if it is only wanted for white-washing, the lime,\r\nafter being well slaked with water, should stick like glue. For this\r\nlast purpose, however, the lime should only be slaked in lumps.\r\n\r\nAt Elis, there is a Temple of Minerva, which was pargetted, they say,\r\nby Panænus, the brother of Phidias, with a mortar that was blended with\r\nmilk and saffron:[2800] hence it is, that, even at the present day,\r\nwhen rubbed with spittle on the finger, it yields the smell and flavour\r\nof saffron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—COLUMNS. THE SEVERAL KINDS OF COLUMNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more closely columns are placed together, the thicker they appear\r\nto be. There are four different kinds of pillars. Those of which the\r\ndiameter at the foot is one-sixth part of the height, are called\r\nDoric. When the diameter is one-ninth, they are Ionic; and when it is\r\none-seventh, Tuscan. The proportions in the Corinthian are the same\r\nas those of the Ionic; but they differ in the circumstance that the\r\nCorinthian capitals are of the same height as the diameter at the\r\nfoot, a thing that gives them a more slender appearance; whereas, in\r\nthe Ionic column, the height of the capital is only one-third of the\r\ndiameter at the foot. In ancient times the rule was, that the columns\r\nshould be one-third of the breadth of the temple in height.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, as originally built, that\r\nspirals[2801] were first placed beneath, and capitals added: and it\r\nwas determined that the diameter of the shafts should be one-eighth of\r\ntheir height, and that the spirals should be one-half of the diameter\r\nin height, the upper extremity of the shaft being one-seventh less in\r\ndiameter than the foot. In addition to these columns, there are what\r\nare called “Attic” columns, quadrangular, and with equal sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57. (24.)—FIVE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM LIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nLime is also employed very extensively in medicine. For this purpose,\r\nfresh lime is selected, which has not been slaked with water. Its\r\nproperties are caustic, resolvent, and attractive; and it prevents\r\nserpiginous ulcers from spreading, being incorporated with vinegar\r\nand oil of roses, for the purpose. When this has been effected,\r\nit is tempered with wax and oil of roses, and applied to promote\r\ncicatrization. In combination with honey, and liquid resin, or hogs’\r\nlard, lime is curative of sprains and scrofulous sores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—MALTHA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaltha[2802] is a cement prepared from fresh lime; lumps of which are\r\nquenched in wine, and then pounded with hogs’ lard and figs, both of\r\nthem, mollifying substances.[2803] It is the most tenacious of all\r\ncements, and surpasses stone in hardness. Before applying the maltha,\r\nthe substance upon which it is used must be well rubbed with oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—GYPSUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nGypsum[2804] has a close affinity with limestone, and there are\r\nnumerous varieties of it. One kind is prepared from a calcined[2805]\r\nstone, as in Syria, and at Thurii, for example. In Cyprus and\r\nat Perrhæbia,[2806] gypsum is dug out of the earth, and at\r\nTymphæa[2807] it is found just below the level of the soil. The\r\nstone that is calcined for this purpose, ought to be very similar\r\nto alabastrites,[2808] or else of a grain like that of marble. In\r\nSyria, they select the hardest stones for the purpose, and calcine\r\nthem with cow-dung, to accelerate the process. Experience has\r\nproved, however, that the best plaster of all is that prepared from\r\nspecular-stone,[2809] or any other stone that is similarly laminated.\r\nGypsum, when moistened, must be used immediately, as it hardens with\r\nthe greatest rapidity; it admits, however, of being triturated over\r\nagain, and so reduced to powder. It is very useful for pargetting, and\r\nhas a pleasing effect when used for ornamental figures and wreaths in\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThere is one remarkable fact connected with this substance; Caius\r\nProculeius,[2810] an intimate friend of the Emperor Augustus, suffering\r\nfrom violent pains in the stomach, swallowed gypsum, and so put an end\r\nto his existence.[2811]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60. (25.)—PAVEMENTS. THE ASAROTOS ŒCOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPavements are an invention of the Greeks, who also practised the art of\r\npainting them, till they were superseded by mosaics.[2812] In this last\r\nbranch of art, the highest excellence has been attained by Sosus,[2813]\r\nwho laid, at Pergamus, the mosaic pavement known as the “Asarotos\r\nœcos;”[2814] from the fact that he there represented, in small\r\nsquares of different colours, the remnants of a banquet lying upon\r\nthe pavement, and other things which are usually swept away with the\r\nbroom, they having all the appearance of being left there by accident.\r\nThere is a dove also, greatly admired, in the act of drinking, and\r\nthrowing the shadow of its head upon the water; while other birds\r\nare to be seen sunning and pluming themselves, on the margin of a\r\ndrinking-bowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61.—THE FIRST PAVEMENTS IN USE AT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first pavements, in my opinion, were those now known to us as\r\nbarbaric and subtegulan[2815] pavements, a kind of work that was\r\nbeaten down with the rammer: at least if we may form a judgment from\r\nthe name[2816] that has been given to them. The first diamonded[2817]\r\npavement at Rome was laid in the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, after\r\nthe commencement of the Third Punic War. That pavements had come into\r\ncommon use before the Cimbric War, and that a taste for them was very\r\nprevalent, is evident from the line of Lucilius—\r\n\r\n  “With checquered emblems like a pavement marked.”[2818]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62.—TERRACE-ROOF PAVEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Greeks have also invented terrace-roof[2819] pavements, and have\r\ncovered their houses with them; a thing that may easily be done in the\r\nhotter climates, but a great mistake in countries where the rain is\r\napt to become congealed. In making these pavements, the proper plan is\r\nto begin with two layers of boards, running different ways, and nailed\r\nat the extremities, to prevent them from warping. Upon this planking\r\na rough-work must be laid, one-fourth of which consists of pounded\r\npottery: and upon this, another bed of rough-work, two-fifths composed\r\nof lime, a foot in thickness, and well beaten down with the rammer.\r\nThe nucleus[2820] is then laid down, a bed six fingers in depth; and\r\nupon that, large square stones, not less than a couple of fingers in\r\nthickness; an inclination being carefully observed, of an inch and a\r\nhalf to every ten feet. This done, the surface is well rubbed down\r\nwith a polishing stone. The general opinion is, that oak[2821] should\r\nnever be used for the planking, it being so very liable to warp; and\r\nit is considered a good plan to cover the boards with a layer of fern\r\nor chaff, that they may be the better able to resist the action of\r\nthe lime. It is necessary, too, before putting down the planking, to\r\nunderset it with a bed of round pebbles. Wheat-ear[2822] tesselated\r\npavements are laid down in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63.—GRÆCANIC PAVEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must not omit here one other kind of pavement, that known as the\r\n“Græcanic.” The ground is well rammed down, and a bed of rough work,\r\nor else broken pottery, is then laid upon it. Upon the top of this,\r\na layer of charcoal is placed, well trodden down with a mixture of\r\nsand, lime, and ashes; care being taken, by line and rule, to give\r\nit a uniform thickness of half a foot. The surface then presents the\r\nordinary appearance of the ground; but if it is well rubbed with the\r\npolishing-stone, it will have all the appearance of a black pavement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64.—AT WHAT PERIOD MOSAIC PAVEMENTS WERE FIRST INVENTED. AT WHAT\r\nPERIOD ARCHED ROOFS WERE FIRST DECORATED WITH GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMosaic[2823] pavements were first introduced in the time of Sylla; at\r\nall events, there is still in existence a pavement, formed of small\r\nsegments, which he ordered to be laid down in the Temple of Fortune, at\r\nPræneste. Since his time, these mosaics have left the ground for the\r\narched roofs of houses, and they are now made of glass. This, however,\r\nis but a recent invention; for there can be no doubt that, when Agrippa\r\nordered the earthenware walls of the hot baths, in the Thermæ which he\r\nwas building at Rome, to be painted in encaustic, and had the other\r\nparts coated with pargetting, he would have had the arches decorated\r\nwith mosaics in glass, if the use of them had been known; or, at all\r\nevents, if from the walls of the Theatre of Scaurus, where it figured,\r\nas already[2824] stated, glass had by that time come to be used for the\r\narched roofs of apartments. It will be as well, therefore, to give some\r\naccount, also, of glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65. (26.)—THE ORIGIN OF GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Syria there is a region known as Phœnice,[2825] adjoining to Judæa,\r\nand enclosing, between the lower ridges of Mount Carmelus, a marshy\r\ndistrict known by the name of Cendebia. In this district, it is\r\nsupposed, rises the river Belus,[2826] which, after a course of five\r\nmiles, empties itself into the sea near the colony of Ptolemaïs. The\r\ntide of this river is sluggish, and the water unwholesome to drink,\r\nbut held sacred for the observance of certain religious ceremonials.\r\nFull of slimy deposits, and very deep, it is only at the reflux of the\r\ntide that the river discloses its sands; which, agitated by the waves,\r\nseparate themselves from their impurities, and so become cleansed. It\r\nis generally thought that it is the acridity of the sea-water that has\r\nthis purgative effect upon the sand, and that without this action no\r\nuse could be made of it. The shore upon which this sand is gathered is\r\nnot more than half a mile in extent; and yet, for many ages, this was\r\nthe only spot that afforded the material for making glass.\r\n\r\nThe story is, that a ship, laden with nitre,[2827] being moored upon\r\nthis spot, the merchants, while preparing their repast upon the\r\nsea-shore, finding no stones at hand for supporting their cauldrons,\r\nemployed for the purpose some lumps of nitre which they had taken from\r\nthe vessel. Upon its being subjected to the action of the fire, in\r\ncombination with the sand of the sea-shore, they beheld transparent\r\nstreams flowing forth of a liquid hitherto unknown: this, it is said,\r\nwas the origin of glass.[2828]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—THE VARIOUS KINDS OF GLASS, AND THE MODE OF MAKING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn process of time, as human industry is ingenious in discovering, it\r\nwas not content with the combination of nitre, but magnet-stone[2829]\r\nbegan to be added as well; from the impression that it attracts\r\nliquefied[2830] glass as well as iron. In a similar manner, too,\r\nbrilliant stones of various descriptions came to be added in the\r\nmelting, and, at last, shells and fossil sand. Some authors tell\r\nus, that the glass of India is made of broken crystal, and that, in\r\nconsequence, there is none that can be compared to it.\r\n\r\nIn fusing it, light and dry wood is used for fuel, Cyprian copper\r\nand nitre being added to the melting, nitre of Ophir[2831] more\r\nparticularly. It is melted, like copper, in contiguous furnaces, and\r\na swarthy mass of an unctuous appearance is the result. Of such a\r\npenetrating nature is the molten glass, that it will cut to the very\r\nbone any part of the body which “it may come near, and that, too,\r\nbefore it is even felt. This mass is again subjected to fusion in the\r\nfurnace, for the purpose of colouring it; after which, the glass is\r\neither blown into various forms, turned in a lathe, or engraved[2832]\r\nlike silver. Sidon was formerly famous for its glass-houses, for it was\r\nthis place that first invented[2833] mirrors.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ancient method of making glass: but, at the present day,\r\nthere is found a very white sand for the purpose, at the mouth of the\r\nriver Volturnus, in Italy. It spreads over an extent of six miles, upon\r\nthe sea-shore that lies between Cumæ and Liternum, and is prepared\r\nfor use by pounding it with a pestle and mortar; which done, it is\r\nmixed with three parts of nitre, either by weight or measure, and,\r\nwhen fused, is transferred to another furnace. Here it forms a mass\r\nof what is called “hammonitrum;” which is again submitted to fusion,\r\nand becomes a mass of pure, white, glass. Indeed, at the present\r\nday, throughout the Gallic and Spanish provinces even, we find sand\r\nsubjected to a similar process. In the reign of Tiberius, it is said,\r\na combination was devised which produced a flexible[2834] glass; but\r\nthe manufactory of the artist was totally destroyed, we are told, in\r\norder to prevent the value of copper, silver, and gold, from becoming\r\ndepreciated.[2835] This story, however, was, for a long time, more\r\nwidely spread than well authenticated. But be it as it may, it is of\r\nlittle consequence; for, in the time of the Emperor Nero, there was a\r\nprocess discovered, by which two small glass cups were made, of the\r\nkind called “petroti,”[2836] the price of which was no less than six\r\nthousand sesterces!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—OBSIAN GLASS AND OBSIAN STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various kinds of glass, we may also reckon Obsian glass,\r\na substance very similar to the stone[2837] which Obsius discovered\r\nin Æthiopia. This stone is of a very dark colour, and sometimes\r\ntransparent; but it is dull to the sight, and reflects, when attached\r\nas a mirror to walls, the shadow of the object rather than the image.\r\nMany persons use it[2838] for jewellery, and I myself have seen\r\nsolid statues[2839] in this material of the late Emperor Augustus, of\r\nvery considerable thickness. That prince consecrated, in the Temple\r\nof Concord, as something marvellous, four figures of elephants made\r\nof Obsian stone. Tiberius Cæsar, too, restored to the people of\r\nHeliopolis, as an object of ceremonial worship, an image in this stone,\r\nwhich had been found among the property left by one of the præfects\r\nof Egypt. It was a figure of Menelaüs; a circumstance which goes far\r\ntowards proving that the use of this material is of more ancient date\r\nthan is generally supposed, confounded as it is at the present day\r\nwith glass, by reason of its resemblance. Xenocrates says that Obsian\r\nstone is found in India also, and in Samnium in Italy; and that it\r\nis a natural product of Spain, upon the coasts which border on the\r\nOcean.[2840]\r\n\r\nThere is an artificial Obsian stone, made of coloured glass for\r\nservices for the table; and there is also a glass that is red all\r\nthrough, and opaque, known as “hæmatinum.”[2841] A dead white glass,\r\ntoo, is made, as also other kinds in imitation of murrhine[2842]\r\ncolour, hyacinthine, sapphire, and every other tint: indeed, there is\r\nno material of a more pliable[2843] nature than this, or better suited\r\nfor colouring. Still, however, the highest value is set upon glass\r\nthat is entirely colourless and transparent, as nearly as possible\r\nresembling crystal, in fact. For drinking-vessels, glass has quite\r\nsuperseded the use of silver and gold; but it is unable to stand heat\r\nunless a cold liquid is poured in first. And yet, we find that globular\r\nglass vessels, filled with water, when brought in contact with the rays\r\nof the sun,[2844] become heated to such a degree as to cause articles\r\nof clothing to ignite. When broken, too, glass admits of being joined\r\nby the agency of heat; but it cannot be wholly fused without being\r\npulverized into small fragments,[2845] as we see done in the process of\r\nmaking the small checquers, known as “abaculi,” for mosaic work; some\r\nof which are of variegated colours, and of different shapes. If glass\r\nis fused with sulphur, it will become as hard as stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68. (27.)—MARVELLOUS FACTS CONNECTED WITH FIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now described all the creations of human ingenuity,\r\nreproductions, in fact, of Nature by the agency of art, it cannot but\r\nrecur to us, with a feeling of admiration, that there is hardly any\r\nprocess which is not perfected through the intervention of fire. Submit\r\nto its action some sandy soil, and in one place it will yield glass, in\r\nanother silver, in another minium, and in others, again, lead and its\r\nseveral varieties, pigments, and numerous medicaments. It is through\r\nthe agency of fire that stones[2846] are melted into copper; by fire\r\nthat iron is produced, and subdued to our purposes; by fire that gold\r\nis purified; by fire, too, that the stone is calcined, which is to hold\r\ntogether the walls of our houses.\r\n\r\nSome materials, again, are all the better for being repeatedly\r\nsubmitted to the action of fire; and the same substance will yield\r\none product at the first fusion, another at the second, and another\r\nat the third.[2847] Charcoal, when it has passed through fire and\r\nhas been quenched, only begins to assume its active properties; and,\r\nwhen it might be supposed to have been reduced to annihilation, it is\r\nthen that it has its greatest energies. An element this, of immense,\r\nof boundless[2848] power, and, as to which, it is a matter of doubt\r\nwhether it does not create even more than it destroys!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69.—THREE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM FIRE AND FROM ASHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFire even has certain medicinal virtues of its own. When pestilences\r\nprevail, in consequence of the obscuration[2849] of the sun, it is a\r\nwell-known fact, that if fires are lighted, they are productive of\r\nbeneficial results in numerous ways. Empedocles and Hippocrates have\r\nproved this in several passages.\r\n\r\n“For convulsions or contusions of the viscera,” says M. Varro—for it is\r\nhis own words that I use—“let the hearth be your medicine-box; for lie\r\nof ashes,[2850] taken from thence, mixed with your drink, will effect\r\na cure. Witness the gladiators, for example, who, when disabled at the\r\nGames, refresh themselves with this drink.” Carbuncle too, a kind of\r\ndisease which, as already[2851] stated, has recently carried off two\r\npersons of consular rank, admits of being successfully treated with\r\noak-charcoal,[2852] triturated with honey. So true is it that things\r\nwhich are despised even, and looked upon as so utterly destitute of all\r\nvirtues, have still their own remedial properties, charcoal and ashes\r\nfor example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70.—PRODIGIES CONNECTED WITH THE HEARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must not omit too, one portentous fact connected with the hearth,\r\nand famous in Roman history. In the reign of Tarquinius Priscus, it\r\nis said, there appeared upon his hearth a resemblance of the male\r\ngenerative organ in the midst of the ashes. The captive Ocrisia, a\r\nservant of Queen Tanaquil, who happened to be sitting there, arose from\r\nher seat in a state of pregnancy, and became the mother of Servius\r\nTullius, who eventually succeeded to the throne.[2853] It is stated,\r\ntoo, that while the child was sleeping in the palace, a flame was seen\r\nplaying round his head; the consequence of which was, that it was\r\nbelieved that the Lar of the household was his progenitor. It was owing\r\nto this circumstance, we are informed, that the Compitalia,[2854] games\r\nin honour of the Lares, were instituted.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Remedies mentioned, eighty-nine.

(1.)—THE FIRST USE OF PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat nothing may be wanting to the work which I have undertaken, it\r\nstill remains for me to speak of precious stones: a subject in which\r\nthe majestic might of Nature presents itself to us, contracted within a\r\nvery limited space, though, in the opinion of many, nowhere displayed\r\nin a more admirable form. So great is the value that men attach to\r\nthe multiplied varieties of these gems, their numerous colours, their\r\nconstituent parts, and their singular beauty, that, in the case of some\r\nof them, it is looked upon as no less than sacrilege to engrave them,\r\nfor signets even, the very purpose for which, in reality, they were\r\nmade. Others, again, are regarded as beyond all price, and could not\r\nbe valued at any known amount of human wealth; so much so that, in the\r\ncase of many, it is quite sufficient to have some single gem or other\r\nbefore the eyes, there to behold the supreme and absolute perfection of\r\nNature’s work.\r\n\r\nWe have already[2889] stated, to some extent, when speaking on the\r\nsubject of gold and rings, how the use of precious stones first\r\noriginated, and from what beginnings this admiration of them has\r\nnow increased to such an universal passion. According to fabulous\r\nlore, the first use of them was suggested by the rocks of Caucasus,\r\nin consequence of an unhappy interpretation which was given to the\r\nstory of the chains of Prometheus: for we are told by tradition, that\r\nhe enclosed a fragment of this stone in iron, and wore it upon his\r\nfinger;[2890] such being the first ring and the first jewel known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 2.—THE JEWEL OF POLYCRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a beginning such as this, the value set upon precious stones\r\nincreased to such a boundless extent, that Polycrates,[2891] the\r\ntyrant of Samos, who ruled over the islands and the adjacent shores,\r\nwhen he admitted that his good fortune had been too great, deemed it\r\na sufficient expiation for all this enjoyment of happiness, to make a\r\nvoluntary sacrifice of a single precious stone; thinking thereby to\r\nbalance accounts with the inconstancy of fortune, and, by this single\r\ncause for regret, abundantly to buy off every ill-will she might\r\nentertain. Weary, therefore, of his continued prosperity, he embarked\r\non board a ship, and, putting out to sea, threw the ring which he wore\r\ninto the waves. It so happened, however, that a fish of remarkable\r\nsize, one destined for the table of a king, swallowed the jewel, as\r\nit would have done a bait; and then, to complete the portentous omen,\r\nrestored it again to the owner in the royal kitchen, by the ruling hand\r\nof a treacherous[2892] fortune.\r\n\r\nThe stone in this ring, it is generally agreed, was a sardonyx,[2893]\r\nand they still show one at Rome, which, if we believe the story,\r\nwas this identical stone. It is enclosed in a horn of gold, and was\r\ndeposited, by the Emperor Augustus, in the Temple of Concord, where it\r\nholds pretty nearly the lowest rank among a multitude of other jewels\r\nthat are preferable to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 3.—THE JEWEL OF PYRRHUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in note after this ring, is the jewel that belonged to another\r\nking, Pyrrhus, who was so long at war with the Romans. It is said that\r\nthere was in his possession an agate,[2894] upon which were to be seen\r\nthe Nine Muses and Apollo holding a lyre; not a work of art, but the\r\nspontaneous produce of Nature,[2895] the veins in it being so arranged\r\nthat each of the Muses had her own peculiar attribute.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these two jewels, authors make no mention of\r\nany others that have been rendered famous. We only find it recorded\r\nby them, that Ismenias the flute-player[2896] was in the habit of\r\ndisplaying great numbers of glittering stones, a piece of vanity, on\r\nhis part, which gave occasion to the following story. An emerald,[2897]\r\nupon which was engraved a figure of Amymone,[2898] being offered for\r\nsale in the Isle of Cyprus at the price of six golden denarii, he gave\r\norders to purchase it. The dealer however, reduced the price, and\r\nreturned two denarii; upon which, Ismenias remarked—“By Hercules! he\r\nhas done me but a bad turn in this, for the merit of the stone has been\r\ngreatly impaired by this reduction in price.”\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been this Ismenias who introduced the universal\r\npractice among musicians of proclaiming their artistic merit by this\r\nkind of ostentation. Thus Dionysodorus, for instance, his contemporary\r\nand rival, imitated his example, in order that he might not appear to\r\nbe his inferior in skill; whereas, in reality, he only held the third\r\nrank among the musicians of that day. Nicomachus, too, it is said, was\r\nthe possessor of great numbers of precious stones, though selected with\r\nbut little taste. In mentioning these illustrations, by way of prelude\r\nto this Book, it is by no means improbable that they may have the\r\nappearance of being addressed to those, who, piquing themselves upon a\r\nsimilar display, become puffed up with a vanity which is evidently much\r\nmore appropriate to a performer on the flute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 4.—WHO WERE THE MOST SKILFUL LAPIDARIES. THE FINEST SPECIMENS OF\r\nENGRAVING ON PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone of the ring[2899] which is now shown as that of Polycrates,\r\nis untouched and without engraving. In the time of Ismenias, long[2900]\r\nafter his day, it would appear to have become the practice to engrave\r\nsmaragdi even; a fact which is established by an edict of Alexander\r\nthe Great, forbidding his portrait to be cut upon this stone by any\r\nother engraver than Pyrgoteles,[2901] who, no doubt, was the most\r\nfamous adept in this art. Since his time, Apollonides and Cronius\r\nhave excelled in it; as also Dioscurides,[2902] who engraved a very\r\nexcellent likeness of the late Emperor Augustus upon a signet,\r\nwhich, ever since, the Roman emperors have used. The Dictator Sylla,\r\nit is said, always made use of a seal[2903] which represented the\r\nsurrender of Jugurtha. Authors inform us also, that the native of\r\nIntercatia,[2904] whose father challenged Scipio Æmilianus,[2905]\r\nand was slain by him, was in the habit of using a signet with a\r\nrepresentation of this combat engraved upon it; a circumstance which\r\ngave rise to the well-known joke of Stilo Præconinus,[2906] who naively\r\nenquired, what he would have done if Scipio had been the person slain?\r\n\r\nThe late Emperor Augustus was in the habit, at first, of using the\r\nfigure of a Sphinx[2907] for his signet; having found two of them,\r\namong the jewels of his mother, that were perfectly alike. During the\r\nCivil Wars, his friends used to employ one of these signets, in his\r\nabsence, for sealing such letters and edicts as the circumstances of\r\nthe times required to be issued in his name; it being far from an\r\nunmeaning pleasantry on the part of those who received these missives,\r\nthat the Sphinx always brought its enigmas[2908] with it. The frog,\r\ntoo, on the seal of Mæcenas, was held in great terror, by reason of the\r\nmonetary imposts which it announced. At a later period, with the view\r\nof avoiding the sarcasms relative to the Sphinx, Augustus made use of a\r\nsignet with a figure upon it of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 5.—THE FIRST DACTYLIOTHECÆ AT ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nA collection of precious stones bears the foreign name of\r\n“dactyliotheca.”[2909] The first person who possessed one at Rome\r\nwas Scaurus,[2910] the step-son of Sylla; and, for a long time,\r\nthere was no other such collection there, until at length Pompeius\r\nMagnus consecrated in the Capitol, among other donations, one that\r\nhad belonged to King Mithridates; and which, as M. Varro and other\r\nauthors of that period assure us, was greatly superior to that of\r\nScaurus. Following his example, the Dictator Cæsar consecrated six\r\ndactyliothecæ in the Temple of Venus Genetrix; and Marcellus, the son\r\nof Octavia,[2911] presented one to the Temple of the Palatine Apollo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 6.—JEWELS DISPLAYED AT ROME IN THE TRIUMPH OF POMPEIUS MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it was this conquest by Pompeius Magnus that first introduced\r\nso general a taste for pearls and precious stones; just as the\r\nvictories, gained by L. Scipio[2912] and Cneius Manlius,[2913] had\r\nfirst turned the public attention to chased silver, Attalic tissues,\r\nand banquetting-couches decorated with bronze; and the conquests of L.\r\nMummius had brought Corinthian bronzes and pictures into notice.\r\n\r\n(2.) To prove more fully that this was the case, I will here give\r\nthe very words of the public Registers[2914] with reference to the\r\ntriumphs of Pompeius Magnus. On the occasion of his third triumph,\r\nover the Pirates and over the Kings and nations of Asia and Pontus\r\nthat have been already enumerated in the Seventh Book[2915] of\r\nthis work, M. Fiso and M. Messala being consuls,[2916] on the day\r\nbefore[2917] the calends of October, the anniversary of his birth, he\r\ndisplayed in public, with its pieces, a chess-board,[2918] made of two\r\nprecious stones, three feet in width by two in length—and to leave no\r\ndoubt that the resources of Nature do become exhausted, I will here\r\nobserve, that no precious stones are to be found at the present day,\r\nat all approaching such dimensions as these; as also that there was\r\nupon this board a moon of solid gold, thirty pounds in weight!—three\r\nbanquetting-couches; vessels for nine waiters, in gold and precious\r\nstones; three golden statues of Minerva, Mars, and Apollo; thirty-three\r\ncrowns adorned with pearls; a square mountain of gold, with stags upon\r\nit, lions, and all kinds of fruit, and surrounded with a vine of gold;\r\nas also a musæum,[2919] adorned with pearls, with an horologe[2920]\r\nupon the top of it.\r\n\r\nThere was a likeness also in pearls of Pompeius himself, his noble\r\ncountenance, with the hair thrown back from the forehead, delighting\r\nthe eye. Yes, I say, those frank features, so venerated throughout all\r\nnations, were here displayed in pearls! the severity of our ancient\r\nmanners being thus subdued, and the display being more the triumph\r\nof luxury than the triumph of conquest. Never, most assuredly, would\r\nPompeius have so long maintained his surname of “Magnus” among the\r\nmen of that day, if on the occasion of his first[2921] conquest his\r\ntriumph had been such as this. Thy portrait in pearls, O Magnus! those\r\nresources of prodigality, that have been discovered for the sake of\r\nfemales only! Thy portrait in pearls, refinements in luxury, which the\r\nRoman laws would not have allowed thee to wear even! And was it in this\r\nway that thy value must be appreciated? Would not that trophy have\r\ngiven a more truthful likeness of thee which thou hadst erst erected\r\nupon the Pyrenæan[2922] mountain heights? Assuredly such a portrait as\r\nthis had been no less than a downright ignominy and disgrace, were we\r\nnot bound to behold in it a menacing presage of the anger of the gods,\r\nand to see foreshadowed thereby the time when that head, now laden\r\nwith the wealth of the East, was to be displayed, severed from the\r\nbody.[2923]\r\n\r\nBut in other respects, how truly befitting the hero was this triumph!\r\nTo the state, he presented two thousand millions of sesterces; to\r\nthe legati and quæstors who had exerted themselves in defence of the\r\nsea coast, he gave one thousand millions of sesterces; and to each\r\nindividual soldier, six thousand sesterces. He has rendered, however,\r\ncomparatively excusable the Emperor Caius,[2924] who, in addition to\r\nother feminine luxuries, used to wear shoes adorned with pearls; as\r\nalso the Emperor Nero, who used to adorn his sceptres with masks worked\r\nin pearls, and had the couches, destined for his pleasures, made of\r\nthe same costly materials. Nay, we have no longer any right, it would\r\nseem, to censure the employment of drinking-cups adorned with precious\r\nstones, of various other articles in daily use that are similarly\r\nenriched, and of rings that sparkle with gems: for what species of\r\nluxury can there be thought of, that was not more innocent in its\r\nresults than this on the part of Pompeius?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 7.—AT WHAT PERIOD MURRHINE VESSELS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED AT ROME.\r\nINSTANCES OF LUXURY IN REFERENCE TO THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the same conquest, too, that first introduced murrhine[2925]\r\nvessels at Rome; Pompeius being the first to dedicate, at the\r\nconclusion of this triumph, vases and cups, made of this material, in\r\nthe Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus: a circumstance which soon brought\r\nthem into private use, waiters, even, and eating-utensils made of\r\nmurrhine being in great request. This species of luxury, too, is daily\r\non the increase, a single cup, which would hold no more than three\r\nsextarii, having been purchased at the price of seventy thousand\r\nsesterces. A. person of consular rank, who some years[2926] ago used\r\nto drink out of this cup, grew so passionately fond of it, as to gnaw\r\nits edges even, an injury, however, which has only tended to enhance\r\nits value: indeed there is now no vessel in murrhine that has ever\r\nbeen estimated at a higher figure than this. We may form some opinion\r\nhow much money this same personage swallowed up in articles of this\r\ndescription, from the fact that the number of them was so great, that,\r\nwhen the Emperor Nero deprived his children of them, and they were\r\nexposed to public view, they occupied a whole theatre to themselves, in\r\nthe gardens beyond the Tiber; a theatre which was found sufficiently\r\nlarge even, for the audience that attended on the occasion when\r\nNero[2927] rehearsed his musical performances before his appearance in\r\nthe Theatre of Pompeius. It was at this exhibition, too, that I saw\r\ncounted the broken fragments of a single cup, which it was thought\r\nproper to preserve in an urn and display, I suppose, with the view\r\nof exciting the sorrows of the world, and of exposing the cruelty of\r\nfortune; just as though it had been no less than the body of Alexander\r\nthe Great himself!\r\n\r\nT. Petronius,[2928] a personage of consular rank, intending, from\r\nhis hatred of Nero, to disinherit the table of that prince, broke a\r\nmurrhine basin, which had cost him no less than three hundred thousand\r\nsesterces. But Nero himself, as it was only proper for a prince to do,\r\nsurpassed them all, by paying one million of sesterces for a single\r\ncup: a fact well worthy of remembrance, that an emperor, the father of\r\nhis country, should have drunk from a vessel of such costly price!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 8.—THE NATURE OF MURRHINE VESSELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMurrhine vessels come from the East, in numerous localities of which,\r\nremarkable for nothing else, they are to be found. It is in the empire\r\nof the Parthians, more particularly, that they are met with, though\r\nthose of the very finest quality come to us from Carmania.[2929] It is\r\ngenerally thought that these vessels are formed of a moist substance,\r\nwhich under ground becomes solidified by heat.[2930] In size they\r\nnever exceed a small waiter,[2931] and, as to thickness, they rarely\r\nadmit of being used as drinking-cups, so large as those already[2932]\r\nmentioned. The brightness of them is destitute of strength, and it may\r\nbe said that they are rather shining than brilliant.[2933] But the\r\nchief merit of them is the great variety of their colours, and the\r\nwreathed veins, which, every here and there, present shades of purple\r\nand white, with a mixture of the two; the purple gradually changing,\r\nas it were, to a fiery red, and the milk-white assuming a ruddy hue.\r\nSome persons praise the edges of these vessels more particularly, with\r\na kind of reflection in the colours, like those beheld in the rain-bow.\r\nOthers, again, are more pleased with them when quite opaque, it being\r\nconsidered a demerit when they are at all transparent, or of a pallid\r\nhue. The appearance, too, of crystals[2934] in them is highly prized,\r\nand of spots that look like warts; not prominent, but depressed, as we\r\nmostly see upon the human body. The perfume,[2935] too, of which they\r\nsmell, is looked upon as an additional recommendation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 9—THE NATURE OF CRYSTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a diametrically opposite cause to this that produces\r\ncrystal,[2936] a substance which assumes a concrete form from excessive\r\ncongelation.[2937] At all events, crystal is only to be found in places\r\nwhere the winter snow freezes with the greatest intensity; and it is\r\nfrom the certainty that it is a kind of ice, that it has received the\r\nname[2938] which it bears in Greek. The East, too, sends us crystal,\r\nthere being none preferred to the produce of India. It is to be found,\r\nalso, in Asia, that of the vicinity of Alabanda,[2939] Orthosia,[2940]\r\nand the neighbouring mountains, being held in a very low degree of\r\nesteem. In Cyprus, also, there is crystal, but that found upon the\r\nAlpine heights in Europe is, in general, more highly valued. According\r\nto Juba, there is crystal in a certain island of the Red Sea, opposite\r\nthe coast of Arabia, called “Necron;”[2941] as, also, in another\r\nneighbouring island[2942] which produces the precious stone known as\r\nthe “topazus;” where a block of crystal was extracted, he says, by\r\nPythagoras, the præfect of King Ptolemæus, no less than a cubit in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nCornelius Bocchus informs us that in Lusitania, there have been blocks\r\nof crystal found, of extraordinary weight, in sinking shafts in the\r\nAmmiensian[2943] mountains there, to a water-level for the supply\r\nof wells. It is a marvellous fact, stated by Xenocrates of Ephesus,\r\nthat in Asia and in the Isle of Cyprus, crystal is turned up by the\r\nplough; it having been the general belief that it is never to be\r\nfound in terreous soils, and only in rocky localities. That is much\r\nmore probable which the same Xenocrates tells us, when he says that\r\nthe mountain streams often bring down with them fragments of crystal.\r\nSudines says, that crystal is only to be found in localities that\r\nface the south, a thing that is known to be really the fact: indeed,\r\nit is never found in humid spots, however cold the climate may be,\r\neven though the rivers there freeze to the very bottom. Rain-water\r\nand pure snow are absolutely necessary for its formation,[2944] and\r\nhence it is, that it is unable to endure heat, being solely employed\r\nfor holding liquids that are taken cold. From the circumstance of its\r\nbeing hexagonal[2945] and hexahedral, it is not easy to penetrate this\r\nsubstance; and the more so, as the pyramidal terminations do not always\r\nhave the same appearance. The polish on its faces is so exquisite, that\r\nno art can possibly equal it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 10.—LUXURY DISPLAYED IN THE USE OF CRYSTAL. REMEDIES DERIVED FROM\r\nCRYSTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest block of crystal that has ever been beheld by us, is\r\nthe one that was consecrated by Julia Augusta in the Capitol, and\r\nwhich weighed about one hundred and fifty pounds.[2946] Xenocrates\r\nspeaks of having seen a vase of crystal, which held one amphora,[2947]\r\nand we find other writers mentioning a vessel from India which held\r\nfour sextarii. For my own part, I can positively say, that there is\r\ncrystal amid the crags of the Alps, so difficult of access, that it is\r\nusually found necessary to be suspended by ropes in order to extract\r\nit. Persons who are experienced in the matter detect its presence by\r\ncertain signs and indications.\r\n\r\nCrystal is subject to numerous defects, sometimes presenting a rough,\r\nsolder-like, substance, or else clouded by spots upon it; while\r\noccasionally it contains some hidden humour[2948] within, or is\r\ntraversed by hard and brittle knurrs,[2949] which are known as “salt\r\ngrains.”[2950] Some crystal, too, has a red rust upon it, while, in\r\nother instances, it contains filaments that look like flaws, a defect\r\nwhich artists conceal by engraving it. But where crystals are entirely\r\nfree from defect, they are preferred uncut; in which case, they are\r\nknown as “acenteta,”[2951] and have the colour, not of foam, but of\r\nlimpid water. In the last place, the weight of crystals is a point\r\nwhich is taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nI find it stated by medical men that the very best cautery for\r\nthe human body is a ball of crystal acted upon by the rays of the\r\nsun.[2952] This substance, too, has been made the object of a mania;\r\nfor, not many years ago, a mistress of a family, who was by no means\r\nvery rich, gave one hundred and fifty thousand sesterces for a single\r\nbasin made of crystal. Nero, on receiving tidings that all was lost,\r\nin the excess of his fury, dashed two cups of crystal to pieces; this\r\nbeing his last act of vengeance upon his fellow-creatures, preventing\r\nany one from ever drinking again from these vessels. Crystal, when\r\nbroken, cannot by any possibility be mended. Vessels in glass have\r\nbeen brought to a marvellous degree of resemblance to crystal; and\r\nyet, wonderful to say, they have only tended to enhance the value of\r\ncrystal, and in no way to depreciate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 11.—AMBER: THE MANY FALSEHOODS THAT HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext in rank among the objects of luxury, we have amber;[2953]\r\nan article which, for the present, however, is in request among\r\nwomen[2954] only. All these three last-mentioned substances hold the\r\nsame rank, no doubt, as precious stones; the two former for certain\r\nfair reasons; crystal, because it is adapted for taking cool drinks,\r\nand murrhine vessels, for taking drinks that are either hot or cold.\r\nBut as for amber, luxury has not been able, as yet, to devise any\r\njustification for the use of it. This is a subject which affords us\r\nan excellent opportunity of exposing some of the frivolities and\r\nfalsehoods of the Greeks; and I beg that my readers will only have\r\npatience with me while I do so, it being really worth while, for our\r\nown practical improvement, to become acquainted with the marvellous\r\nstories which they have promulgated respecting amber.\r\n\r\nAfter Phaëthon had been struck by lightning, his sisters, they tell\r\nus, became changed into poplars,[2955] which every year shed their\r\ntears upon the banks of the Eridanus, a river known to us as the\r\n“Padus.” To these tears was given the name of “electrum,”[2956] from\r\nthe circumstance that the Sun was usually called “elector.” Such is\r\nthe story, at all events, that is told by many of the poets, the first\r\nof whom were, in my opinion, Æschylus, Philoxenus, Euripides, Satyrus,\r\nand Nicander; and the falsity of which is abundantly proved upon the\r\ntestimony of Italy itself.[2957] Those among the Greeks who have\r\ndevoted more attention to the subject, have spoken of certain islands\r\nin the Adriatic Sea, known as the “Electrides,” and to which the\r\nPadus,[2958] they say, carries down electrum. It is the fact, however,\r\nthat there never were any islands there so called, nor, indeed, any\r\nislands so situate as to allow of the Padus carrying down anything\r\nin its course to their shores. As to Æschylus placing the Eridanus\r\nin Iberia, or, in other words, in Spain, and giving it the name of\r\nRhodanus; and as to Euripides and Apollonius representing the Rhodanus\r\nand the Padus as discharging themselves by one common mouth on the\r\nshores of the Adriatic; we can forgive them all the more readily for\r\nknowing nothing about amber when they betray such monstrous ignorance\r\nof geography.\r\n\r\nOther writers, again, who are more guarded in their assertions, have\r\ntold us, though with an equal degree of untruthfulness, that, at the\r\nextremity of the Adriatic Gulf, upon certain inaccessible rocks there,\r\nthere are certain trees[2959] which shed their gum at the rising of the\r\nDog-Star. Theophrastus[2960] has stated that amber is extracted from\r\nthe earth in Liguria;[2961] Chares, that Phaëthon died in the territory\r\nof Hammon, in Æthiopia, where there is a temple of his and an oracle,\r\nand where amber is produced; Philemon, that it is a fossil substance,\r\nand that it is found in two different localities in Scythia, in one of\r\nwhich it is of a white and waxen colour, and is known as “electrum;”\r\nwhile in the other it is red, and is called “sualiternicum.”\r\nDemostratus calls amber “lyncurion,”[2962] and he says that it\r\noriginates in the urine of the wild beast known as the “lynx;” that\r\nvoided by the male producing a red and fiery substance, and that by the\r\nfemale an amber of a white and less pronounced colour: he also informs\r\nus that by some persons it is called “langurium,” and that in Italy,\r\nthere are certain wild beasts known as “languri.” Zeuothemis, however,\r\ncalls these wild beasts “langæ,” and gives the banks of the river Padus\r\nas their locality. Sudines says, that it is a tree in reality, that\r\nproduces amber, and that, in Etruria, this tree is known by the name\r\nof “lynx;” an opinion which is also adopted by Metrodorus. Sotacus\r\nexpresses a belief that amber exudes from certain stones in Britannia,\r\nto which he gives the name of “electrides.” Pytheas says that the\r\nGutones,[2963] a people of Germany, inhabit the shores of an estuary\r\nof the Ocean called Mentonomon, their territory extending a distance\r\nof six thousand stadia; that, at one day’s sail from this territory,\r\nis the Isle of Abalus, upon the shores of which, amber is thrown up by\r\nthe waves in spring, it being an excretion of the sea in a concrete\r\nform; as, also, that the inhabitants use this amber by way of fuel, and\r\nsell it to their neighbours, the Teutones. Timæus, too, is of the same\r\nbelief, but he has given to the island the name of Basilia.[2964]\r\n\r\nPhilemon says that electrum does not yield a flame.[2965] Nicias,\r\nagain, will have it, that it is a liquid produced by the rays of the\r\nsun; and that these rays, at the moment of the sun’s setting, striking\r\nwith the greatest force upon the surface of the soil, leave upon it an\r\nunctuous sweat, which is carried off by the tides of the Ocean, and\r\nthrown up upon the shores of Germany. He states, also, that in Egypt\r\nit is similarly produced, and is there called “sacal;”[2966] that it\r\nis found in India, too, where it is held as a preferable substitute\r\nfor frankincense; and that in Syria the women make the whirls of their\r\nspindles of this substance, and give it the name of “harpax,”[2967]\r\nfrom the circumstance that it attracts leaves towards it, chaff, and\r\nthe light fringe of tissues. According to Theochrestus, amber is thrown\r\nup by the tides of the Ocean, at the foot of the Pyrenæan range; an\r\nopinion adopted also by Xenocrates. Asarubas, who has written the most\r\nrecently upon these subjects, and is still living, informs us, that\r\nnear the shores of the Atlantic is Lake Cephisis, known to the Mauri by\r\nthe name of “Electrum;” and that when this lake is dried up by the sun,\r\nthe slime of it produces amber, which floats upon the surface. Mnaseas\r\nspeaks of a locality in Africa called Sicyon, and of a river Crathis\r\nthere, which discharges itself from a lake into the Ocean, the banks of\r\nwhich are frequented by birds which he calls “meleagrides”[2968] and\r\n“penelopes:” it is here that, according to him, electrum is produced,\r\nin manner above mentioned. Theomenes says that near the Greater Syrtis\r\nare the Gardens of the Hesperides, and Lake Electrum: on the banks, he\r\nsays, are poplars, from the summits of which amber falls into the water\r\nbelow, where it is gathered by the maidens of the Hesperides.\r\n\r\nCtesias asserts that there is in India[2969] a river called Hypobarus,\r\na word which signifies “bearer of all good things;” that this river\r\nflows from the north into the Eastern Ocean, where it discharges itself\r\nnear a mountain covered with trees which produce electrum; and that\r\nthese trees are called “siptachoræ,” the meaning of which is “intense\r\nsweetness.” Mithridates says, that off the shores of Germany there\r\nis an island called “Serita,”[2970] covered with a kind of cedar,\r\nfrom which amber falls upon the rocks. According to Xenocrates, this\r\nsubstance is called, in Italy, not only “succinum,” but “thieum” as\r\nwell, the Scythian name of it, for there also it is to be found, being\r\n“sacrium:” others, he says, are of opinion that it is a product of\r\nNumidia. But the one that has surpassed them all is Sophocles, the\r\ntragic poet; a thing that indeed surprises me, when I only consider\r\nthe surpassing gravity of his lofty style, the high repute that he\r\nenjoyed in life, his elevated position by birth at Athens, his various\r\nexploits, and his high military command. According to him, amber is\r\nproduced in the countries beyond India, from the tears that are shed\r\nfor Meleager, by the birds called “meleagrides!”[2971] Who can be\r\notherwise than surprised that he should have believed such a thing as\r\nthis, or have hoped to persuade others to believe it? What child, too,\r\ncould possibly be found in such a state of ignorance as to believe that\r\nbirds weep once a year, that their tears are so prolific as this, or\r\nthat they go all the way from Greece, where Meleager died, to India to\r\nweep? “But then,” it will be said, “do not the poets tell many other\r\nstories that are quite as fabulous?” Such is the fact, no doubt, but\r\nfor a person seriously to advance such an absurdity with reference to\r\na thing so common as amber, which is imported every day and so easily\r\nproves the mendacity of this assertion, is neither more nor less than\r\nto evince a supreme contempt for the opinions of mankind, and to assert\r\nwith impunity an intolerable falsehood.\r\n\r\n(3.) There can be no doubt that amber is a product of the islands\r\nof the Northern Ocean, and that it is the substance by the Germans\r\ncalled “glæsum;”[2972] for which reason the Romans, when Germanicus\r\nCæsar commanded the fleet in those parts, gave to one of these\r\nislands the name of Glæsaria,[2973] which by the barbarians was known\r\nas Austeravia. Amber is produced from a marrow discharged by trees\r\nbelonging to the pine[2974] genus, like gum from the cherry, and resin\r\nfrom the ordinary pine. It is a liquid at first, which issues forth in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and is gradually hardened by heat or cold, or\r\nelse by the action of the sea, when the rise of the tide carries off\r\nthe fragments from the shores of these islands. At all events, it is\r\nthrown up upon the coasts, in so light and voluble a form that in the\r\nshallows it has all the appearance of hanging suspended in the water.\r\nOur forefathers, too, were of opinion that it is the juice of a tree,\r\nand for this reason gave it the name of “succinum:”[2975] and one great\r\nproof that it is the produce of a tree of the pine genus, is the fact\r\nthat it emits a pine-like smell when rubbed, and that it burns, when\r\nignited, with the odour and appearance of torch-pine wood.\r\n\r\nAmber is imported by the Germans into Pannonia, more particularly; from\r\nwhence the Veneti, by the Greeks called Eneti, first brought it into\r\ngeneral notice, a people in the vicinity of Pannonia, and dwelling on\r\nthe shores of the Adriatic Sea. From this it is evident how the story\r\nwhich connects it with the Padus first originated; and at the present\r\nday we see the female peasantry in the countries that lie beyond that\r\nriver wearing necklaces of amber, principally as an ornament, no doubt,\r\nbut on account of its remedial virtues as well; for amber, it is\r\ngenerally believed, is good for affections of the tonsillary glands\r\nand fauces, the various kinds of water in the vicinity of the Alps\r\nbeing apt to produce disease in the human throat.[2976]\r\n\r\nFrom Carnuntum in Pannonia, to the coasts of Germany from which the\r\namber is brought, is a distance of about six hundred miles, a fact\r\nwhich has been only very recently ascertained; and there is still\r\nliving a member of the equestrian order, who was sent thither by\r\nJulianus, the manager of the gladiatorial exhibitions for the Emperor\r\nNero, to procure a supply of this article. Traversing the coasts of\r\nthat country and visiting the various markets there, he brought back\r\namber, in such vast quantities, as to admit of the nets, which are\r\nused for protecting the podium[2977] against the wild beasts, being\r\nstudded[2978] with amber.\r\n\r\nThe arms too, the litters,[2979] and all the other apparatus, were, on\r\none day, decorated with nothing but amber, a different kind of display\r\nbeing made each day that these spectacles were exhibited. The largest\r\npiece of amber that this personage brought to Rome was thirteen pounds\r\nin weight.\r\n\r\nThat amber is found in India too, is a fact well ascertained.\r\nArchelaüs, who reigned over Cappadocia, says that it is brought\r\nfrom that country in the rough state, and with the fine bark still\r\nadhering to it, it being the custom there to polish it by boiling it\r\nin the grease of a sucking-pig. One great proof that amber must have\r\nbeen originally in a liquid state, is the fact that, owing to its\r\ntransparency, certain objects are to be seen within, ants for example,\r\ngnats, and lizards. These, no doubt, must have first adhered to it\r\nwhile liquid, and then, upon its hardening, have remained enclosed\r\nwithin.[2980]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 12.—THE SEVERAL KINDS OF AMBER: THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds[2981] of amber. The white is the one that has\r\nthe finest odour;[2982] but neither this nor the wax-coloured amber\r\nis held in very high esteem. The red amber is more highly valued; and\r\nstill more so, when it is transparent, without presenting too brilliant\r\nand igneous an appearance. For amber, to be of high quality, should\r\npresent a brightness like that of fire, but not flakes resembling\r\nthose of flame. The most highly esteemed amber is that known as the\r\n“Falernian,” from its resemblance to the colour of Falernian wine; it\r\nis perfectly transparent, and has a softened, transparent, brightness.\r\nOther kinds, again, are valued for their mellowed tints, like the\r\ncolour of boiled honey in appearance. It ought to be known, however,\r\nthat any colour can be imparted to amber that may be desired, it being\r\nsometimes stained with kid-suet and root of alkanet; indeed, at the\r\npresent day, amber is dyed purple even. When a vivifying heat has been\r\nimparted to it by rubbing it between the fingers, amber will attract\r\nchaff, dried leaves, and thin bark, just in the same way that the\r\nmagnet attracts iron. Pieces of amber, steeped in oil, burn with a more\r\nbrilliant and more lasting flame than pith of flax.[2983]\r\n\r\nSo highly valued is this as an object of luxury, that a very diminutive\r\nhuman effigy, made of amber, has been known to sell at a higher price\r\nthan living men even, in stout and vigorous health. This single ground\r\nfor censure, however, is far from being sufficient; in Corinthian\r\nobjects of vertu, it is the copper that recommends them, combined with\r\nsilver and gold; and in embossed works it is the skill and genius of\r\nthe artist that is so highly esteemed. We have already said what it is\r\nthat recommends vessels of murrhine and of crystal; pearls, too, are of\r\nuse for wearing upon the head, and gems upon the fingers. In the case\r\nof all other luxuries, in fact, it is either a spirit of ostentation or\r\nsome utility that has been discovered in them that pleads so strongly\r\nin their behalf; but in that of amber we have solely the consciousness\r\nthat we are enjoying a luxury, and nothing more. Domitius Nero, among\r\nthe other portentous extravagances of his life, bestowed this name upon\r\nthe ringlets of his wife Poppæa, and, in certain verses of his, he has\r\neven gone so far as to call them “succini.” As fine names, too, are\r\nnever wanting for bodily defects, a third tint has been introduced of\r\nlate for hair among our ladies, under the name of “amber-colour.”\r\n\r\nAmber, however, is not without its utility in a medicinal point of\r\nview; though it is not for this reason that the women are so pleased\r\nwith it. It is beneficial for infants also, attached to the body in\r\nthe form of an amulet; and, according to Callistratus, it is good for\r\nany age, as a preventive of delirium and as a cure for strangury,\r\neither taken in drink or attached as an amulet to the body. This last\r\nauthor, too, has invented a new variety of amber; giving the name\r\nof “chryselectrum”[2984] to an amber of a golden colour, and which\r\npresents the most beautiful tints in the morning. This last kind\r\nattracts flame, too, with the greatest rapidity, and, the moment it\r\napproaches the fire, it ignites. “Worn upon the neck, he says, it is a\r\ncure for fevers and other diseases, and, triturated with honey and oil\r\nof roses, it is good for maladies of the ears. Beaten up with Attic\r\nhoney, it is good for dimness of sight: and the powder of it, either\r\ntaken by itself or with gum mastich in water, is remedial for diseases\r\nof the stomach. Amber, too, is greatly in request for the imitation\r\nof the transparent precious stones, amethystos in particular: for, as\r\nalready stated, it admits of being dyed of every colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 13.—LYNCURUIM: TWO ASSERTED REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pertinacity that has been displayed by certain authors compels me\r\nto speak of lyncurium[2985] next; for even those who maintain that\r\nit is not a variety of amber, still assure us that it is a precious\r\nstone. They assert, too, that it is a product of the urine of the lynx\r\nand of a kind of earth, the animal covering up the urine the moment it\r\nhas voided it, from a jealousy that man should gain possession of it;\r\na combination which hardens into stone. The colour of it, they inform\r\nus, like that of some kinds of amber, is of a fiery[2986] hue, and\r\nit admits, they say, of being engraved. They assert, too, that this\r\nsubstance attracts[2987] to itself not only leaves or straws, but thin\r\nplates of copper even or of iron; a story which Theophrastus even\r\nbelieves, on the faith of a certain Diocles.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I look upon the whole of these statements as untrue,\r\nand I do not believe that in our time there has ever been a precious\r\nstone seen with such a name as this. I regard, too, the assertions that\r\nhave been made as to its medicinal properties, as equally false; to the\r\neffect that, taken in drink, it disperses urinary calculi, and that,\r\ntaken in wine, or only looked at, it is curative of jaundice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 14.—THE VARIOUS PRECIOUS STONES, CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR\r\nPRINCIPAL COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to speak of the various kinds of precious stones,\r\nthe existence of which is generally admitted, beginning with those\r\nwhich are the most highly esteemed. Nor shall we content ourselves\r\nwith doing this only; but, with the view of consulting the general\r\nwelfare of mankind, we shall also refute the infamous lies that\r\nhave been promulgated by the magicians: for it is with reference to\r\nprecious stones, more particularly, that they have circulated most of\r\ntheir fabulous stories, stepping, under that most alluring guise of\r\nascertaining remedial virtues, beyond all bounds, and entering the\r\nregion of the marvellous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 15. (4.)—ADAMAS: SIX VARIETIES OF IT. TWO REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe substance that possesses the greatest value, not only among the\r\nprecious stones, but of all human possessions, is adamas;[2988] mineral\r\nwhich, for a long time, was known to kings only, and to very few of\r\nthem. Such was the name given to a nodosity of gold,[2989] sometimes,\r\nthough but rarely, found in the mines, in close proximity with gold,\r\nand only there to be found, it was thought. The ancients supposed\r\nthat adamas was only to be discovered in the mines of Æthiopia,[2990]\r\nbetween the Temple of Mercury and the island of Meroë; and they have\r\ninformed us that it was never larger than a cucumber-seed, or differing\r\nat all from it in colour.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, for the first time, there are no less than six\r\ndifferent varieties of it recognized. The Indian adamas is found,\r\nnot in a stratum of gold, but in a substance of a kindred nature\r\nto crystal; which it closely resembles in its transparency and its\r\nhighly polished hexangular and hexahedral[2991] form. In shape it\r\nis turbinated, running to a point at either extremity, and closely\r\nresembling, marvellous to think of, two cones united at the base. In\r\nsize, too, it is as large even as a hazel-nut. Resembling that of\r\nIndia, is the adamas[2992] of Arabia, which is found in a similar\r\nbed, but not so large in size. Other varieties have a pallid hue like\r\nthat of silver, and are only to be found in the midst of gold of the\r\nvery finest quality. These stones are tested upon the anvil, and will\r\nresist the blow to such an extent, as to make the iron rebound and\r\nthe very anvil split asunder.[2993] Indeed its hardness is beyond all\r\nexpression, while at the same time it quite sets fire at defiance[2994]\r\nand is incapable of being heated; owing to which indomitable powers it\r\nis, that it has received the name which it derives from the Greek.[2995]\r\n\r\nOne kind, about as large as a grain of millet in size, has been called\r\n“cenchros,”[2996] and another,[2997] that is found in the gold mines\r\nat Philippi, is known as the “Macedonian” adamas: this last is about\r\nas large as a cucumber-seed in size. We next come to the Cyprian[2998]\r\nadamas, so called from its being found in the Isle of Cyprus: it is of\r\na colour somewhat inclining to that of copper, but, in reference to its\r\nmedicinal virtues, of which we shall have to make further mention, it\r\nis the most efficacious of them all. Next in succession to this we have\r\nsiderites,[2999] a stone which shines like iron, and is more ponderous\r\nthan any of the others, but differs in its properties from them all.\r\nFor it breaks when struck by the hammer, and admits of being perforated\r\nby other kinds of adamas; a thing which is the case, also, with that of\r\nCyprus: in short, these two are degenerate stones, and only bear the\r\nname of “adamas” for the purpose of enhancing their value.\r\n\r\nNow with reference to those affinities and repugnances which exist\r\nbetween certain objects, known to the Greeks as “sympathia” and\r\n“antipathia,” phænomena to which we have endeavoured[3000] to draw\r\nattention throughout these books, they nowhere manifest themselves with\r\ngreater distinctness than here. This indomitable power, in fact, which\r\nsets at nought the two most violent agents in Nature, fire, namely, and\r\niron, is made to yield before the blood of a he-goat.[3001] The blood,\r\nhowever must be no otherwise than fresh and warm; the stone, too, must\r\nbe well steeped in it, and then subjected to repeated blows: and even\r\nthen, it is apt to break both anvils and hammers of iron, if they are\r\nnot of the very finest temper. To what spirit of research, or to what\r\naccident, are we indebted for this discovery? or what conjecture can\r\nit have been, that first led man to experiment upon a thing of such\r\nextraordinary value as this, and that, too, with the most unclean[3002]\r\nof all animals? Surely a discovery, such as this, must have been due\r\nsolely to the munificence of the gods, and we must look for the reason\r\nof it in none of the elementary operations of Nature, but wholly in her\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nWhen, by good fortune, this stone does happen to be broken, it divides\r\ninto fragments so minute as to be almost imperceptible. These particles\r\nare held in great request by engravers, who enclose them in iron, and\r\nare enabled thereby, with the greatest facility, to cut[3003] the very\r\nhardest substances known. So great is the antipathy borne by this\r\nstone to the magnet, that when placed near, it will not allow of its\r\nattracting iron; or if the magnet has already attracted the iron, it\r\nwill seize the metal and drag it away from the other.[3004] Adamas,\r\ntoo, overcomes and neutralizes poisons, dispels delirium, and banishes\r\ngroundless perturbations of the mind; hence it is that some have given\r\nit the name of “ananchites.”[3005] Metrodorus of Scepsis is the only\r\nauthor, that I know of, who says that this stone is found also in\r\nGermany, and in the island of Basilia,[3006] where amber is found. He\r\nsays, too, that this is preferable to the stone of Arabia; but can\r\nthere be any doubt that his statement is incorrect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 16.—-SMARAGDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext[3007] in esteem with us are the pearls of India and Arabia, of\r\nwhich we have already spoken in the Ninth Book,[3008] when treating of\r\nthe marine productions.\r\n\r\n(5.) The third rank, for many reasons, has been given to the\r\nsmaragdus.[3009] Indeed there is no stone, the colour of which is more\r\ndelightful to the eye; for whereas the sight fixes itself with avidity\r\nupon the green[3010] grass and the foliage of the trees, we have all\r\nthe more pleasure in looking upon the smaragdus, there being no green\r\nin existence of a more intense colour[3011] than this. And then,\r\nbesides, of all the precious stones, this is the only one that feeds\r\nthe sight without satiating it. Even when the vision has been fatigued\r\nwith intently viewing other objects, it is refreshed by being turned\r\nupon this stone; and lapidaries know of nothing that is more gratefully\r\nsoothing to the eyes, its soft green tints being wonderfully adapted\r\nfor assuaging lassitude, when felt in those organs.\r\n\r\nAnd then, besides, when viewed from a distance, these stones appear all\r\nthe larger to the sight, reflecting as they do, their green hues upon\r\nthe circumambient air. Neither sunshine, shade, nor artificial light\r\neffects any change in their appearance; they have always a softened\r\nand graduated brilliancy; and transmitting the light with facility,\r\nthey allow the vision to penetrate their interior; a property which is\r\nso pleasing, also, with reference to water. In form they are mostly\r\nconcave, so as to re-unite the rays of light and the powers of vision:\r\nand hence it is, that it is so universally agreed upon among mankind\r\nto respect these stones, and to forbid their surface[3012] to be\r\nengraved. In the case, however, of the stones of Scythia and Egypt,\r\ntheir hardness is such, that it would be quite impossible to penetrate\r\nthem. When the surface of the smaragdus is flat, it reflects the image\r\nof objects in the same manner as a mirror. The Emperor Nero used to\r\nview[3013] the combats of the gladiators upon a smaragdus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 17.—TWELVE VARIETIES OF THE SMARAGDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this stone there are no less than twelve different kinds; of\r\nwhich the finest is the Scythian[3014] smaragdus, so called from the\r\ncountry where it is found. None of them has a deeper colour than this,\r\nor is more free from defects: indeed, in the same degree that the\r\nsmaragdus is superior to other precious stones, the Scythian smaragdus\r\nis superior to the other varieties. Next in esteem to this, as also\r\nin locality, is the smaragdus of Bactriana.[3015] These stones are\r\ncollected, it is said, in the fissures of rocks, when the Etesian[3016]\r\nwinds prevail; a period at which the earth that covers them is removed,\r\nand the stones are detected by their brightness, the sands being\r\ngreatly agitated by the action of the winds. These last, however, are\r\nmuch inferior, they say, to those of Scythia in size. The third rank is\r\nheld by the stones of Egypt,[3017] which are extracted from the hills\r\nin the vicinity of Coptos, a city of Thebais.\r\n\r\nAll the other kinds are found in copper-mines, and hence it is that, of\r\nthese varieties, the smaragdus of Cyprus holds the highest rank. The\r\nmerit of them consists in their clear colour, which has nothing thin\r\nor diluted in it, but presents a rich and humid transparency, closely\r\nresembling the tints of the sea, in fact. Hence it is that these stones\r\nare at once diaphanous and shining, or, in other words, reflect their\r\ncolours and allow the vision to penetrate within. They say that in\r\nthis island, upon the tomb of a petty king named Hermias, near the\r\nfisheries[3018] there, there was formerly a lion in marble, with eyes\r\nmade of smaragdi; the brilliancy of which penetrated the sea to such\r\na degree, as to alarm the tunnies and put them to flight: a novel\r\ncircumstance, which for a long time excited wonder in the fishermen,\r\ntill at last the stones in the statue were changed for others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 18.—DEFECTS IN THE SMARAGDUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be only proper, too, seeing that the prices of these stones\r\nare so exorbitant, to point out their defects. Some defects, no doubt,\r\nare common to all of them, while others, again, like those found in\r\nthe human race, are peculiar only to those of a certain country. Thus,\r\nfor example, the stones of Cyprus are not all green alike, and in the\r\nsame smaragdus some parts are more or less so than others, the stone\r\nnot always preserving that uniform deep tint which characterizes the\r\nsmaragdus of Scythia. In other instances, a shadow runs through the\r\nstone, and the colour becomes dulled thereby; the consequence of which\r\nis, that its value is depreciated; and even more so, when the colour is\r\nthin and diluted.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the defects[3019] in these stones, they have been\r\ndivided into several classes. Some of them are obscure, and are then\r\nknown as “blind” stones; some have a certain density, which impairs\r\ntheir transparency; others, again, are mottled, and others covered\r\nwith a cloud. This cloud, however, is altogether different from the\r\nshadow above mentioned; for it is a defect which renders the stone of\r\na whitish hue, and not of a transparent green throughout; presenting,\r\nas it does, in the interior or upon the surface, a certain degree of\r\nwhiteness which arrests the vision. Other defects, again, in these\r\nstones, are filaments, salt-like[3020] grains, or traces of lead ore,\r\nfaults which are mostly common to them all.\r\n\r\nNext after the kinds above described, the smaragdus of Æthiopia is\r\nheld in high esteem; being found, as Juba tells us, at a distance\r\nof twenty-five days’ journey from Coptos. These are of a bright\r\ngreen, but are seldom to be met with perfectly clear or of an uniform\r\ncolour. Democritus includes in this class the stones that are known\r\nas “herminei,” and as “Persian” stones; the former of which are of a\r\nconvex, massive shape, while the latter are destitute of transparency,\r\nbut have an agreeable, uniform colour, and satisfy the vision without\r\nallowing it to penetrate them; strongly resembling, in this respect,\r\nthe eyes of cats and of panthers, which are radiant without being\r\ndiaphanous. In the sun, he says, they lose their brilliancy, but they\r\nare radiant in the shade, the brightness of them being seen at a\r\ngreater distance than in the case of other stones. One other fault,\r\ntoo, in all these stones is, that they often have a colour like that of\r\nhoney or rancid oil, or else are clear and transparent, but not green.\r\n\r\nThese defects exist in the smaragdi of Attica,[3021] more particularly,\r\nwhich are found in the silver-mines there, at a place known by the\r\nname of Thoricos.[3022] These last are never so massive as the others,\r\nand are always more pleasing to the sight when viewed from a distance:\r\nlead ore, too, is often to be detected in them, or, in other words,\r\nthey have a leaden appearance when looked at in the sun.[3023] One\r\npeculiarity in them is, that some of them become impaired by age,\r\ngradually lose their green colour, and are even deteriorated by\r\nexposure to the sun. Next to the stones of Attica come those of Media,\r\na variety which presents the most numerous tints of all, and sometimes\r\napproaches sapphiros[3024] in colour. These stones are wavy,[3025] and\r\nrepresent various natural objects, such as poppy-heads, for example,\r\nbirds, the young of animals, and feathers: all of them appear naturally\r\nof a green colour, but become improved by the application of oil. No\r\nstones of this species are of a larger size than these.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that any of these stones[3026] are still in existence\r\nat Chalcedon, the copper mines of that locality being now exhausted:\r\nbut be this as it may, they were always the smallest in size and the\r\nmost inferior in value. Brittle, and of a colour far from distinctly\r\npronounced, they resembled in their tints the feathers that are seen\r\nin the tail of the peacock or on the necks of pigeons.[3027] More or\r\nless brilliant, too, according to the angle at which they were viewed,\r\nthey presented an appearance like that of veins and scales. There was\r\nanother defect, also, peculiar to these stones, known as “sarcion,”\r\nfrom the circumstance that a kind of flesh[3028] appeared to attach\r\nitself to the stone. The mountain near Chalcedon, where these stones\r\nwere gathered, is still known by the name of “Smaragdites.” Juba\r\ninforms us that a kind of smaragdus, known as “cloras,”[3029] is used\r\nin Arabia as an ornament for buildings, as also the stone which by\r\nthe people of Egypt is called “alabastrites.” On the same authority,\r\ntoo, we learn that there are several varieties of the smaragdus in the\r\nneighbouring mountains, and that stones like those of Media are found\r\nin Mount Taygetus,[3030] as also in Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 19.—THE PRECIOUS STONE CALLED TANOS. CHALCOSMARAGDOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the smaragdi is also included the precious stone known as\r\n“tanos.”[3031] It comes from Persia, and is of an unsightly green, and\r\nof a soiled colour within. There is the chalcosmaragdos[3032] also,\r\na native of Cyprus, the face of which is mottled with coppery veins.\r\nTheophrastus relates that he had found it stated in the Egyptian\r\nhistories, that a king of Babylon once sent to the king of Egypt a\r\nsmaragdus[3033] four cubits in length by three in breadth. He informs\r\nus, also, that in a temple of Jupiter in Egypt there was an obelisk\r\nmade of four smaragdi, forty cubits in length, and four in breadth at\r\none extremity, and two at the other. He says, too, that at the period\r\nat which he wrote, there was in the Temple of Hercules at Tyrus a\r\nlarge column made of a single smaragdus;[3034] though very possibly\r\nit might only be pseudo-smaragdus, a kind of stone not uncommonly\r\nfound in Cyprus, where a block had been discovered, composed, one\r\nhalf of smaragdus, and one half of jasper,[3035] and the liquid in\r\nwhich had not as yet been entirely transformed. Apion, surnamed\r\n“Plistonices,”[3036] has left a very recent statement, that there was\r\nstill in existence, in his time, in the Labyrinth of Egypt, a colossal\r\nstatue of Serapis made of a single smaragdus, nine cubits in height.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 20.—BERYLS: EIGHT VARIETIES OF THEM. DEFECTS IN BERYLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeryls, it is thought, are of the same[3037] nature as the smaragdus,\r\nor at least closely analogous. India[3038] produces them, and they\r\nare rarely to be found elsewhere. The lapidaries cut all beryls of an\r\nhexagonal[3039] form; because the colour, which is deadened by a dull\r\nuniformity of surface, is heightened by the reflection resulting from\r\nthe angles. If they are cut in any other way, these stones have no\r\nbrilliancy whatever. The most esteemed beryls are those which in colour\r\nresemble the pure green of the sea;[3040] the chrysoberyl[3041] being\r\nnext in value, a stone of a somewhat paler colour, but approaching a\r\ngolden tint. Closely allied to this last in its brilliancy, but of\r\na more pallid colour, and thought by some to constitute a separate\r\ngenus, is chrysoprasus.[3042] In the fourth rank are reckoned the\r\nhyacinthine beryls; and in the fifth, those known as “aëroides.”[3043]\r\nNext, we have the wax-coloured beryls, and, after them, the oleaginous\r\nberyls, so called from the resemblance of their colour to that of oil.\r\nLast of all, there are the stones which closely resemble crystal in\r\nappearance; mostly disfigured by spots and filaments, and of a poor,\r\nfaint, colour as well; all of them so many imperfections in the stone.\r\n\r\nThe people of India are marvellously fond of beryls of an\r\nelongated[3044] form, and say that these are the only precious\r\nstones they prefer wearing without the addition of gold: hence it is\r\nthat, after piercing them, they string them upon the bristles of the\r\nelephant. It is generally agreed, however, that those stones should not\r\nbe perforated which are of the finest quality; and in this case they\r\nonly enclose the extremities of them in studs of gold. They prefer,\r\ntoo, cutting the beryls in a cylindrical form, instead of setting\r\nthem as precious stones; an elongated shape being the one that is\r\nmost highly esteemed. Some are of opinion that beryls are naturally\r\nangular,[3045] and that when pierced they become improved in colour;\r\nthe white substance being thus removed that lies within, and their\r\nbrilliancy heightened by the reflection of the gold in which they are\r\nset; or, at all events, their transparency being increased by this\r\ndiminution in their thickness. In addition to the defects already[3046]\r\nmentioned, and which are pretty nearly the same as those to which the\r\nsmaragdus is subject, beryls are affected with cloudy spots,[3047] like\r\nthose on the finger-nails in appearance. In our own part of the world,\r\nit is thought that they are sometimes found in the countries that lie\r\nin the vicinity of Pontus.[3048] The people of India, by colouring\r\ncrystal, have found a method of imitating various precious stones,\r\nberyls in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 21. (6.)—OPALS: SEVEN VARIETIES OF THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpals[3049] are at once very similar to, and very different from,\r\nberyls, and only yield to the smaragdus in value. India, too, is\r\nthe sole[3050] parent of these precious stones, thus completing\r\nher glory as being the great producer of the most costly gems.\r\nOf all precious stones, it is opal that presents the greatest\r\ndifficulties of description, it displaying at once the piercing fire\r\nof carbunculus,[3051] the purple brilliancy of amethystos, and the\r\nsea-green of smaragdus, the whole blended together and refulgent with\r\na brightness that is quite incredible. Some authors have compared the\r\neffect of its refulgence to that of the colour known as Armenian[3052]\r\npigment, while others speak of it as resembling the flame of burning\r\nsulphur, or of flame fed with oil. In size, the opal is about as large\r\nas a hazel-nut,[3053] and, with reference to it, there is a remarkable\r\nhistorical anecdote related. For there is still in existence a stone\r\nof this class, on account of which Antonius proscribed the senator\r\nNonius, son of the Nonius Struma, whom the poet Catullus[3054] was\r\nso displeased at seeing in the curule chair, and grandfather of the\r\nServilius Nonianus, who in our own times was consul.[3055] On being\r\nthus proscribed, Nonius took to flight, carrying with him, out of all\r\nhis wealth, nothing but this ring, the value of which, it is well\r\nknown, was estimated at two millions of sesterces. How marvellous\r\nmust have been the cruelty, how marvellous the luxurious passion of\r\nAntonius, thus to proscribe a man for the possession of a jewel! and\r\nno less marvellous must have been the obstinacy of Nonius, who could\r\nthus dote upon what had been the cause of his proscription; for we see\r\nthe very brutes even tear off the portion of their body for the sake of\r\nwhich they know their existence to be imperilled,[3056] and so redeem\r\nthemselves by parting with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 22.—DEFECTS IN OPALS: THE MODES OF TESTING THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDefects in opal are, a colour inclining to that of the flower called\r\nheliotropium,[3057] or to that of crystal or of hailstones; salt-like\r\ngrains intervening; roughness on the surface; or sharp points,\r\npresenting themselves to the eye. There is no stone that is imitated\r\nby fraudulent dealers with more exactness than this, in glass, the\r\nonly mode of detecting the imposition being by the light of the sun.\r\nFor when a false[3058] opal is held between the finger and thumb, and\r\nexposed to the rays of that luminary, it presents but one and the\r\nsame transparent colour throughout, limited to the body of the stone:\r\nwhereas the genuine opal offers various refulgent tints in succession,\r\nand reflects now one hue and now another, as it sheds its luminous\r\nbrilliancy upon the fingers.\r\n\r\nThis stone, in consequence of its extraordinary beauty, has been called\r\n“pæderos”[3059] by many authors; and some who make a distinct species\r\nof it, say that it is the same as the stone that in India is called\r\n“sangenon.” These last-mentioned stones, it is said, are found in\r\nEgypt also, Arabia, and, of very inferior quality, in Pontus. Galatia,\r\ntoo, is said to produce them, as also Thasos and Cyprus. The finest in\r\nquality of them have all the beauty of opal, but they are of a softer\r\nbrilliancy, and are mostly rough on the surface. Their colour is a\r\nmixture of sky-blue and purple, and the green hues of the smaragdus\r\nare wanting: those, too, are preferred, which have their brilliancy\r\ndeepened by a vinous hue, rather than those which have their colours\r\ndiluted, as it were, with water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 23.—SARDONYX; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT. DEFECTS IN THE\r\nSARDONYX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far we have spoken in reference to the stones, which, it is\r\ngenerally agreed, belong to the highest rank; in obedience, more\r\nparticularly, to a decree[3060] that has been passed by the ladies to\r\nthat effect. There is less certainty with respect to those upon which\r\nthe men as well have been left to form a judgment; seeing that the\r\nvalue of each stone depends more particularly upon the caprice of the\r\nindividual and the rivalry that exists in reference thereto; as, for\r\nexample, when Claudius Cæsar was so much in the habit of wearing the\r\nsmaragdus and the sardonyx.[3061] The first Roman who wore a sardonyx,\r\naccording to Demostratus, was the elder Africanus, since whose time\r\nthis stone has been held in very high esteem at Rome: for which reason,\r\nwe shall give it the next place after the opal. By sardonyx, as the\r\nname[3062] itself indicates, was formerly understood a sarda with a\r\nwhite ground beneath it, like the flesh beneath the human finger-nail;\r\nboth parts of the stone being equally transparent. Such, according to\r\nIsmenias, Demostratus, Zenothemis, and Sotacus, is the sardonyx of\r\nIndia; the last two giving the name of “blind” sardonyx to all the\r\nother stones of this class which are not transparent, and which have\r\nnow entirely appropriated the name to themselves. For, at the present\r\nday, the Arabian sardonyx presents no traces whatever of the Indian\r\nsarda,[3063] it being a stone that has been found to be characterized\r\nby several different colours of late; black or azure for the base, and\r\nvermilion, surrounded with a line of rich white, for the upper part,\r\nnot without a certain glimpse[3064] of purple as the white passes into\r\nthe red.[3065]\r\n\r\nWe learn from Zenothemis that in his time these stones were not held\r\nby the people of India in any high esteem, although they are found\r\nthere of so large a size as to admit of the hilts of swords being\r\nmade of them. It is well known, too, that in that country they are\r\nexposed to view by the mountain-streams, and that in our part of the\r\nworld they were formerly valued from the fact that they are nearly the\r\nonly ones[3066] among the engraved precious stones that do not bring\r\naway the wax when an impression is made. The consequence is, that our\r\nexample has at last taught the people of India to set a value upon\r\nthem, and the lower classes there now pierce them even, to wear them as\r\nornaments for the neck; the great proof, in fact, at the present day,\r\nof a sardonyx being of Indian origin. Those of Arabia are remarkable\r\nfor their marginal line of brilliant white, of considerable breadth,\r\nand not glistening in hollow fissures in the stone or upon the sides,\r\nbut shining upon the very surface, at the margin, and supported by a\r\nground intensely black beneath. In the stones of India, this ground\r\nis like wax in colour,[3067] or else like cornel, with a circle also\r\nof white around it. In some of these stones, too, there is a play of\r\ncolours like those of the rainbow, while the surface is redder even\r\nthan the shell of the sea-locust.[3068]\r\n\r\nThose stones which are like honey in appearance, or of a fæculent[3069]\r\ncolour—such being the name given to one defect in them—are generally\r\ndisapproved of. They are rejected also when the white zone blends\r\nitself with the other colours, and its limits are not definitely\r\nmarked; or if, in like manner, it is irregularly intersected by any\r\nother colour; it being looked upon as an imperfection if the regularity\r\nof any one of the colours is interrupted by the interposition of\r\nanother. The sardonyx of Armenia is held in some esteem, but the zone\r\nround it is of a pallid hue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 24.—ONYX: THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must give some account also of onyx,[3070] because of the name which\r\nit partly shares in common with sardonyx. This name, though in some\r\nplaces[3071] given to a marble, is here used to signify a precious\r\nstone. Sudines says, that in this stone there is a white portion which\r\nresembles the white of the human-finger nail, in addition to the\r\ncolours of chrysolithos, sarda, and iaspis. According to Zenothemis,\r\nthere are numerous varieties of the Indian onyx, the fiery-coloured,\r\nthe black, and the cornel, with white veins encircling them, like an\r\neye as it were, and in some cases running across them obliquely.[3072]\r\nSotacus mentions an Arabian onyx, which differs from the rest; that of\r\nIndia, according to him, presenting small flames,[3073] each surrounded\r\nby one or more white zones; in a manner altogether different from the\r\nIndian sardonyx, which presents a series of white specks, while in this\r\ncase it is one continuous circle. The Arabian onyx, on the other hand,\r\nis black, he says, with a white zone encircling it.\r\n\r\nSatyrus says, that there is an onyx in India of a flesh colour,[3074]\r\npartly resembling carbunculus, and partly chrysolithos and amethystos;\r\na variety, however, which he altogether disapproves of. The real\r\nonyx, according to him, has numerous veins of variegated colours,\r\ninterspersed with others of a milk-white hue; the shades of which,\r\nas they pass into one another, produce a tint which surpasses all\r\ndescription, and blends itself into one harmonious whole, of a most\r\nbeautiful appearance.\r\n\r\nNot unlike sardonyx, too, is sarda,[3075] a stone which also has, in\r\npart, a kindred name with it; but before passing on to it, we must\r\nfirst take some notice of all those precious stones which have a\r\nbrilliancy like that of flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 25. (7.)—CARBUNCULUS: TWELVE VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first rank among these is carbunculus,[3076] so called from its\r\nresemblance to fire; though in reality it is proof against the action\r\nof that element:[3077] hence it is that some persons call these stones\r\n“acaustoi.”[3078] There are various kinds of carbunculus, the Indian\r\nand the Garamantic, for example, which last has been also called the\r\nCarchedonian,[3079] in compliment to the former opulence of Great\r\nCarthage.[3080] To these are added the Æthiopian and the Alabandic\r\nstones, the latter of which are found at Orthosia[3081] in Caria, but\r\nare cut and polished at Alabanda.[3082] In addition to this, each kind\r\nis subdivided into the male carbunculus and the female, the former\r\nof which is of a more striking brilliancy, the brightness of the\r\nlatter being not so strong. In the male varieties too, we see some in\r\nwhich the fire is clearer than in others; while some, again, are of a\r\ndarker[3083] hue, or else have their brilliancy more deeply seated, and\r\nshine with a more powerful lustre than others when viewed in the sun.\r\n\r\nThe most highly esteemed, however, is the amethyst-coloured[3084]\r\nstone, the fire at the extremity of which closely approaches the\r\nviolet tint of amethystos: next in value to which, are the stones\r\nknown as “syrtites,” radiant with a wavy, feathery,[3085] refulgence.\r\nThey are found more particularly, it is said, where the reflection\r\nis most powerful of the rays of the sun. Satyrus says that the\r\ncarbunculus[3086] of India has no lustre, that it is mostly soiled,\r\nand that in all cases its brilliancy is of a tawny complexion. The\r\nÆthiopian stones, he says, are dense, emit no lustre, and burn with a\r\nconcentrated flame. According to Callistratus, the refulgence of this\r\nstone should be of a whitish hue, and, when placed upon a table, it\r\nshould heighten by its lustre other stones placed near it that are\r\nclouded at the edge. Hence it is, that many writers speak of this\r\nstone as the white carbunculus, while the Indian stone, with its\r\ncomparatively feeble lustre, is known by the name of “lignyzon.”[3087]\r\nThe Carchedonian stones, they say, are of much smaller size than the\r\nothers; but those of India admit of being hollowed out, and making\r\nvessels that will hold as much as one sextarius[3088] even.\r\n\r\nAccording to Archelaüs, the Carchedonian carbunculus is of a more\r\nswarthy appearance than the others, but, when exposed to the light of\r\nthe fire or sun, and viewed obliquely, the brilliancy of it is much\r\nmore intense than that of the rest. He says, too, that this stone, when\r\novershadowed by a roof, has a purple tint; that when viewed in the open\r\nair, it is of a flame colour; and that, when exposed to the rays of\r\nthe sun, it scintillates. He states also that wax, if sealed with these\r\nstones, in the shade even, will melt. Many authors have asserted that\r\nthe Indian stones are paler than the Carchedonian, and that, quite the\r\nconverse of these last, they are all the less brilliant when viewed\r\nobliquely; as also, that in the male Carchedonian stone there are\r\nluminous points like stars within, while, in the case of the female\r\nstone, the whole of its refulgence is thrown beyond it. The stones of\r\nAlabanda too, it is said, are darker than the other kinds, and rough on\r\nthe surface. In the vicinity also of Miletus, there are stones of this\r\ndescription found in the earth, resembling those of Alabanda in colour,\r\nand proof against the action of fire.\r\n\r\nAccording to Theophrastus,[3089] these stones are to be found also at\r\nOrchomenus in Arcadia and in the Isle of Chios;[3090] the former[3091]\r\nof which are of a darker hue, and are used for making mirrors. He says\r\ntoo, that at Trœzen they are found of various colours and mottled with\r\nwhite spots, those found at Corinth being of a more pallid, whitish,\r\nhue. He states also, that they are sometimes imported from Massilia.\r\nBocchus informs us in his writings, that these stones are extracted\r\nfrom the ground at Olisipo;[3092] at the cost of great labour, however,\r\nin consequence of the parched, argillaceous, nature of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 26.—DEFECTS IN CARBUNCULUS, AND THE MODE OF TESTING IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing is more difficult than to distinguish the several varieties of\r\nthis stone, so great an opportunity do they afford to artistic skill of\r\ncompelling them to reflect the colours of substances placed beneath. It\r\nis possible, they say, to heighten the brilliancy of dull stones, by\r\nsteeping them for fourteen days in vinegar, this adventitious lustre\r\nbeing retained by them as many months. They are counterfeited, too,\r\nwith great exactness in glass; but the difference may be detected with\r\nthe touchstone; the same being the case also with other artificial\r\nstones, as the material is always of a softer nature and comparatively\r\nbrittle. When thus tested by the stone, hard knots, too, are detected\r\nin them; and the weight of the glass counterfeit is always less. In\r\nsome cases, too, they present small blisters within, which shine like\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 27.—AHTHRACITIS.[3093]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a fossil stone found in Thesprotia, known as\r\n“anthracitis,”[3094] and resembling a burning coal[3095] in appearance.\r\nThose who have stated that it is a native also of Liguria, are\r\nmistaken, in my opinion, unless perhaps it was to be found there in\r\ntheir time. Some of these stones, they say, are surrounded with a\r\nvein of white. Like those which we have mentioned above, they have a\r\nfiery colour, but there is this peculiarity in them, that when thrown\r\ninto the fire they have all the appearance of becoming quenched and\r\ndeadened; while, on the other hand, if they are drenched with water,\r\nthey become doubly glowing.[3096]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 28.—SANDASTROS. SANDARESOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf a kindred nature, too, is sandastros,[3097] known as “garamantites”\r\nby some: it is found in India, at a place of that name, and is a\r\nproduct also of the southern parts of Arabia. The great recommendation\r\nof it is, that it has all the appearance of fire placed behind a\r\ntransparent substance, it burning with star-like scintillations\r\nwithin, that resemble drops of gold, and are always to be seen in\r\nthe body of the stone, and never upon the surface. There are certain\r\nreligious associations, too, connected with this stone, in consequence\r\nof the affinity which it is supposed to bear with the stars; these\r\nscintillations being mostly, in number and arrangement, like the\r\nconstellations of the Pleiades and Hyades; a circumstance which had led\r\nto the use of it by the Chaldæi in the ceremonials which they practise.\r\n\r\nHere, too, the male stones are distinguished from the female, by their\r\ncomparative depth of colour and the vigorousness of the tints which\r\nthey impart to objects near them: indeed the stones of India, it is\r\nsaid, quite dim the sight by their brilliancy. The flame of the female\r\nsandastros is of a more softened nature, and may be pronounced to be\r\nlustrous rather than brilliant. Some prefer the stone of Arabia to that\r\nof India, and say that this last bears a considerable resemblance to\r\na smoke-coloured chrysolithos. Ismenias asserts that sandastros, in\r\nconsequence of its extreme softness, will not admit of being polished,\r\na circumstance which makes it sell all[3098] the dearer: other writers,\r\nagain, call these stones “sandrisitæ.” One point upon which all the\r\nauthorities are agreed is, that the greater the number of stars upon\r\nthe stone, the more costly it is in price.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the name has sometimes caused this stone to be\r\nconfounded with that known as “sandaresos,” and which Nicander calls\r\n“sandaserion,” and others “sandaseron.” Some, again, call this\r\nlast-mentioned stone “sandastros,” and the former one “sandaresos.” The\r\nstone[3099] that is thus mentioned by Nicander, is a native of India as\r\nwell as the other, and likewise takes its name from the locality where\r\nit is found. The colour of it is that of an apple, or of green oil, and\r\nno one sets any value on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 29.—LYCHNIS: FOUR VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the same class of flame-coloured stones belongs that known as\r\n“lychnis;”[3100] so called from its lustre being heightd by the light\r\nof the lamp, under which circumstances its tints are particularly\r\npleasing. It is found in the vicinity of Orthosia, throughout the whole\r\nof Caria, and in the neighbouring localities; but the most approved\r\nstones are those that come from India. Some writers have given the\r\nname of “deadened”[3101] carbunculus to a lychnis of second-rate\r\nquality, and similar in colour to the flower known as the “flower of\r\nJove.”[3102] I find other varieties also mentioned, one with a purple\r\nradiance, and another of a scarlet[3103] tint. It is asserted, too,\r\nthat these stones, when heated or rubbed between the fingers, will\r\nattract[3104] chaff and filaments of paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 30.—CARCHEDONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarchedonia,[3105] too, is said to have the same property, though far\r\ninferior in value to the stones already mentioned. It is found in the\r\nmountains among the Nasamones,[3106] being produced, the natives think,\r\nby showers sent for the purpose from heaven. These stones are found\r\nby the light of the moon, more particularly when at full: in former\r\ndays, Carthage was the entrepôt for them. Archelaüs speaks of a brittle\r\nvariety being found in the vicinity of Thebes also, in Egypt, full of\r\nveins, and similar to dying embers in appearance. I find it stated,\r\ntoo, that in former times, drinking-vessels used to be made of this\r\nstone and of lychnis:[3107] all these kinds of stone, however, offer\r\nthe most obstinate resistance to the graver, and, if used for seals,\r\nare apt to bring away a part of the wax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 31.—SARDA: FIVE VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSarda,[3108] on the other hand, is remarkably useful for this purpose;\r\na stone which shares its name, in part, with sardonyx. It is a common\r\nstone, and was first found at Sardes, but the most esteemed kind is\r\nthat of the vicinity of Babylon. When certain quarries are being\r\nworked, these stones are found, adhering, like a kind of heart, to the\r\ninterior of the rock. This mineral, however, is said to be now extinct\r\nin Persia; though it is to be found in numerous other localities, Paros\r\nand Assos, for example.\r\n\r\nIn India[3109] there are three varieties of this stone; the red sarda,\r\nthe one known as “pionia,” from its thickness, and a third kind,\r\nbeneath which they place a ground of silver tinsel. The Indian stones\r\nare transparent, those of Arabia being more opaque. There are some\r\nfound also in the vicinity of Leucas in Epirus, and in Egypt, which\r\nhave a ground placed beneath them of leaf gold. In the case of this\r\nstone, too, the male stone shines with a more attractive brilliancy\r\nthan the female, which is of a thicker substance, and more opaque.\r\nAmong the ancients there was no precious stone in more common use than\r\nthis; at all events, it is this stone that is made so much parade\r\nof in the comedies of Menander and Philemon. No one, too, among the\r\ntransparent stones is tarnished more speedily by exposure to moisture\r\nthan this; though of all liquids, it is oil that acts the most readily\r\nupon it. Those stones which are like honey in colour, are generally\r\ndisapproved of, and still more so, when they have the complexion of\r\nearthenware.[3110]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 32. (8.)—TOPAZOS: TWO VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTopazos[3111] is a stone that is still held in very high estimation\r\nfor its green tints: indeed, when it was first discovered, it was\r\npreferred to every other kind of precious stone. It so happened that\r\nsome Troglodytic pirates, suffering from tempest and hunger, having\r\nlanded upon an island off the coast of Arabia known as Cytis,[3112]\r\nwhen digging there for roots and grass, discovered this precious stone:\r\nsuch, at least, is the opinion expressed by Archelaüs. Juba says that\r\nthere is an island in the Red Sea called “Topazos,”[3113] at a distance\r\nof three hundred stadia from the main land; that it is surrounded by\r\nfogs, and is often sought by navigators in consequence; and that,\r\nowing to this, it received its present name,[3114] the word “topazin”\r\nmeaning “to seek,” in the language of the Troglodytæ. He states also,\r\nthat Philon, the king’s præfect, was the first to bring these stones\r\nfrom this island; that, on his presenting them to Queen Berenice, the\r\nmother of the second Ptolemæus, she was wonderfully pleased with them;\r\nand that, at a later period, a statue, four cubits in height, was\r\nmade of this stone,[3115] in honour of Arsinoë, the wife of Ptolemæus\r\nPhiladelphus, it being consecrated in the temple known as the “Golden\r\nTemple.”\r\n\r\nThe most recent writers say that this stone is found also in the\r\nvicinity of Alabastrum, a city of Thebais, and they distinguish two\r\nvarieties of it, the prasoïdes[3116] and the chrysopteron;[3117] which\r\nlast is similar to chrysoprasus,[3118] all the shades of it tending,\r\nmore or less, to resemble the colouring principle of the leek. Topazos\r\nis the largest of all the precious stones, and is the only one among\r\nthose of high value that yields to the action of the file, the rest\r\nbeing polished by the aid of stone of Naxos.[3119] It admits, too, of\r\nbeing worn by use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 33.—CALLAINA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this stone we must also couple another, which resembles it\r\nmore closely in appearance than in value, the stone known as\r\n“callaina,”[3120] and of a pale green colour. It is found in the\r\ncountries[3121] that lie at the back of India, among the Phycari,\r\nnamely, who inhabit Mount Caucasus, the Sacæ, and the Dahæ. It is\r\nremarkable for its size, but is covered with holes and full of\r\nextraneous matter; that, however, which is found in Carmania is of a\r\nfiner quality, and far superior. In both cases, however, it is only\r\namid frozen and inaccessible rocks that it is found, protruding from\r\nthe surface, like an eye in appearance, and slightly adhering to the\r\nrock; not as though it formed an integral part of it, but with all\r\nthe appearance of having been attached to it. People so habituated as\r\nthey are to riding on horseback, cannot find the energy and dexterity\r\nrequisite for climbing the rocks to obtain the stones, while, at the\r\nsame time, they are quite terrified at the danger of doing so. Hence\r\nit is, that they attack the stones with slings from a distance, and\r\nso bring them down, moss and all. It is with this stone that the\r\npeople pay their tribute, and this the rich look upon as their most\r\ngraceful ornament for the neck.[3122] This constitutes the whole of\r\ntheir wealth, with some, and it is their chief glory to recount how\r\nmany of these stones they have brought down from the mountain heights\r\nsince the days of their childhood. Their success, however, is extremely\r\nvariable;[3123] for while some, at the very first throw, have brought\r\ndown remarkably fine specimens, many have arrived at old age without\r\nobtaining any.\r\n\r\nSuch is the method of procuring these stones; their form being given\r\nthem by cutting, a thing that is easily effected. The best of them\r\nhave just the colour of smaragdus, a thing that proves that the most\r\npleasing property in them is one that belongs of right to another\r\nstone. Their beauty is heightened by setting them in gold, and there\r\nis no stone to which the contrast of the gold is more becoming. The\r\nfinest of them lose their colour by coming in contact with oil,\r\nunguents, or undiluted wine even; whereas those of a poorer quality\r\npreserve their colour better. There is no stone, too, that is more\r\neasily counterfeited in glass. Some writers say, that this stone is\r\nto be found in Arabia also, in the nest of the bird known as the\r\n“melancoryphus.”[3124]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 34.—PRASIUS; THREE VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other kinds also of green stones. To the more common\r\nclass belongs prasius;[3125] one variety of which is disfigured with\r\nspots[3126] like blood, while another kind is marked with three streaks\r\nof white. To all these stones chrysoprasus[3127] is preferred, which is\r\nalso similar to the colouring matter of the leek, but varies in tint\r\nbetween topazos and gold. This stone is found of so large a size as to\r\nadmit of drinking-boats[3128] even being made of it, and is cut into\r\ncylinders very frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 35.—NILION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia, which produces these stones, produces nilion[3129] also, a stone\r\nthat differs from the last in its dull, diminished lustre, which, when\r\nsteadily looked upon, soon fades from the sight. Sudines says that it\r\nis to be found also in the Siberus, a river of Attica. In appearance it\r\nresembles a smoke-coloured topazos, or, in some cases, a topazos with\r\na tint like honey. According to Juba, Æthiopia produces it, upon the\r\nshores of the river known to us as the Nilus; to which circumstance, he\r\nsays, it owes its name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 36.—MOLOCHITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMolochitis[3130] is not transparent, being of a deeper green, and more\r\nopaque than smaragdus; its name is derived from the mallow,[3131] which\r\nit resembles in colour. It is highly esteemed for making seals, and\r\nit is endowed by Nature with medicinal properties which render it a\r\npreservative for infants against certain dangers which menace them.\r\nThis stone is a native of Arabia.[3132]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 37.—IASPIS; FOURTEEN VARIETIES OF IT. DEFECTS FOUND IN IASPIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIaspis,[3133] too, is green, and often transparent; a stone which, if\r\nsurpassed by many others, still retains the renown which it acquired in\r\nformer times. Many countries produce this stone: that of India is like\r\nsmaragdus in colour; that of Cyprus is hard, and of a full sea-green;\r\nand that of Persia is sky-blue, whence its name, “aërizusa.”[3134]\r\nSimilar to this last is the Caspian iaspis. On the banks of the river\r\nThermodon the iaspis is of an azure colour; in Phrygia, it is purple;\r\nand in Cappadocia of an azure purple, sombre, and not refulgent.\r\nAmisos[3135] sends us an iaspis like that of India in colour, and\r\nChalcedon,[3136] a stone of a turbid hue.\r\n\r\nBut it is of less consequence to distinguish the several localities\r\nthat furnish it, than it is to remark upon the degrees of excellence\r\nwhich they present. The best kind is that which has a shade of purple,\r\nthe next best being the rose-coloured, and the next the stone with\r\nthe green colour of the smaragdus; to each of which the Greeks have\r\ngiven names[3137] according to their respective tints. A fourth kind,\r\nwhich is called by them “boria,”[3138] resembles in colour the sky\r\nof a morning in autumn; this, too, will be the same that is known as\r\n“aërizusa.”[3139] There is an iaspis also which resembles sarda[3140]\r\nin appearance, and another with a violet tint. Not less numerous, too,\r\nare the other kinds that are left undescribed; but they are all blue to\r\na fault,[3141] or else resemble crystal in appearance, or the tints of\r\nthe myxa[3142] plum. There is the terebenthine[3143]-coloured iaspis\r\nalso; improperly so called, in my opinion, as it has all the appearance\r\nof being a composition of numerous gems of this description.\r\n\r\nThe best of these stones are set in an open bezel, the gold of which\r\nonly embraces the margins of the stone, leaving the upper and lower\r\nsurfaces uncovered. One great defect in them is a subdued lustre,\r\nand a want of refulgence when viewed from a distance. Grains also\r\nlike salt appear within the stone, and all the other defects which\r\nare common[3144] to precious stones in general. Sometimes they are\r\nimitated in glass; a fraud, however, which may be easily detected, from\r\nthe material throwing out its refulgence, instead of concentrating\r\nit within itself. To this class also belongs the stone called\r\n“sphragis,”[3145] which is only reckoned as belonging to the domain of\r\nprecious stones, from the circumstance that it is the best of all for\r\nmaking signets.[3146]\r\n\r\n(9.) Throughout all the East, it is the custom, it is said, to wear\r\niaspis by way of amulet. The variety of this stone which resembles\r\nsmaragdus in colour is often found with a white line running\r\ntransversely through the middle; in which case it is known as\r\n“monogrammos:”[3147] when it is streaked with several lines, it is\r\ncalled “polygrammos.”[3148] Here, too, I may take the opportunity of\r\nexposing the falsehoods[3149] of the magicians, who pretend that this\r\nstone is beneficial for persons when speaking in public. There is a\r\nstone also that is formed of iaspis and onyx combined, and is known\r\nas “iasponyx.”[3150] Sometimes this stone has a clouded appearance;\r\nsometimes it has spots upon the surface like snow;[3151] and sometimes\r\nit is stellated with red spots.[3152] One kind resembles salt of\r\nMegara[3153] in appearance, and another is known as capnias,[3154]\r\nand looks as if it had been smoked. We have seen in our day an\r\niaspis[3155] fifteen inches in length, of which a figure of Nero was\r\nmade, armed with a cuirass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 38.—CYANOS; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must also give a separate account of cyanos,[3156] a name which,\r\nuntil very recently, was given to a species of iaspis, on account of\r\nits cærulean colour. The best kind is that of Scythia,[3157] the next\r\nbest being the produce of Cyprus, and, last of all, that of Egypt.\r\nAn artificial[3158] kind is much in use, that is prepared by dyeing\r\nother substances; and this invention is looked upon as one of the\r\ngreat glories of the kings of Egypt, the name of the king who first\r\ndiscovered it being still preserved in their annals. This stone, too,\r\nis divided into male and female, and sometimes it has the appearance of\r\nbeing powdered with a golden dust, in much the same way as sapphiros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 39.—SAPPHIROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor sapphiros,[3159] too, is refulgent with spots[3160] like gold. It\r\nis also of an azure colour, though sometimes, but rarely, it is purple;\r\nthe best kind being that which comes from Media. In no case, however,\r\nis this stone diaphanous; in addition to which, it is not suited for\r\nengraving when intersected with hard particles of a crystalline[3161]\r\nnature. Those among them that have the colour of cyanos are generally\r\nthought to be the male stones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 40.—AMETHYSTOS; FOUR VARIETIES OF IT. SOCONDION. SAPENOS.\r\nPHARANITIS. APHRODITES BLEPHARON, ANTEROS, OR PÆDEROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now commence with another class of precious stones, those of\r\na purple colour, or whose tints are derived from purple. To the first\r\nrank belongs the amethystos[3162] of India; a stone which is also found\r\nin the part of Arabia that adjoins Syria and is known as Petra, as also\r\nin Lesser Armenia, Egypt, and Galatia; the very worst of all, and the\r\nleast valued, being those of Thasos and Cyprus. The name which these\r\nstones bear, originates, it is said, in the peculiar tint of their\r\nbrilliancy, which, after closely approaching the colour of wine, passes\r\noff into a violet without being fully pronounced; or else, according to\r\nsome authorities, in the fact that in their purple there is something\r\nthat falls short of a fiery colour, the tints fading off and inclining\r\nto the colour of wine.\r\n\r\nAll these stones are transparent and of an agreeable violet colour,\r\nand are easy[3163] to engrave. Those of India have in perfection the\r\nvery richest shades of purple, and it is to attain this colour that the\r\ndyers[3164] in purple direct all their endeavours; it presenting a fine\r\nmellowed appearance to the eye, and not dazzling the sight, as in the\r\ncase with the colours of the carbunculus. Another variety approaches\r\nmore nearly the hyacinth in colour: the people of India call this tint\r\n“socon,” and the stone itself “socondion.” A third stone of this class\r\nis of a more diluted colour, and is known as “sapenos,” being identical\r\nwith “pharanitis,” so called from a country[3165] on the frontiers of\r\nArabia that produces it. Of a fourth kind, the colour is like that of\r\nwine; and in a fifth it borders very closely upon that of crystal,\r\nthe purple gradually passing off into white. This last kind is but\r\nlittle valued; for a fine amethyst should always have, when viewed\r\nsideways[3166] and held up to the light, a certain purple refulgence,\r\nlike that of carbunculus, slightly inclining to a tint of rose.\r\n\r\nSome prefer giving these stones the name of “pæderos”[3167] or of\r\n“anteros,”[3168] while to many they are known as “Venus’[3169] eyelid,”\r\na name which would seem to be particularly appropriate to the colour\r\nand general appearance of the gem. The falsehoods of the magicians\r\nwould persuade us that these stones are preventive of inebriety, and\r\nthat it is from this that they have derived[3170] their name. They tell\r\nus also, that if we inscribe the names of the sun and moon upon this\r\nstone, and then wear it suspended from the neck, with some hair of\r\nthe cynocephalus[3171] and feathers of the swallow, it will act as a\r\npreservative against all noxious spells. It is said too, that worn in\r\nany manner, this stone will ensure access to the presence of kings; and\r\nthat it will avert hail and the attacks of locusts, if a certain prayer\r\nis also repeated which they mention. They make similar promises, too,\r\nin reference to the smaragdus, if graven with the figure of an eagle\r\nor of a scarabæus: statements which, in my opinion, they cannot have\r\ncommitted to writing without a feeling of contempt and derision for the\r\nrest of mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 41.—HYACINTHOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery different from this stone is hyacinthos,[3172] though partaking\r\nof a colour that closely borders upon it. The great difference between\r\nthem is, that the brilliant violet which is so refulgent in the\r\namethystos, is diluted in the other stone. Though pleasing at first\r\nsight, its beauty fades before the eye is satiated; indeed, so far is\r\nit from satisfying the sight, that it almost wholly fails to attract\r\nthe eye, its lustre disappearing more rapidly than the tints of the\r\nflower[3173] known by the same name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 42.—CHRYSOLITHOS: SEVEN VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nÆthiopia, which produces hyacinthos, produces chrysolithos[3174] also,\r\na transparent stone with a refulgence like that of gold. The stones\r\nof India are the most highly esteemed, as also those found among the\r\nTibareni,[3175] provided these last are not of a mottled hue. The worst\r\nin quality are those of Arabia, the colour of them being turbid and\r\nmottled, and their brilliancy interrupted by cloudy spots: even too,\r\nwhen they happen to be limpid, they have all the appearance of being\r\nfull, as it were, of a peculiar dust. The best stones are those which,\r\nwhen placed by the side of gold, impart to it a sort of whitish hue,\r\nand so give it the appearance of silver. When this is the case, they\r\nare set in a bezel that is open on either side; but when the stone is\r\nof inferior quality, a ground of aurichalcum[3176] is placed beneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 43.—CHRYSELECTRUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough it has now altogether gone out of use for jewellery, there\r\nis a precious stone known as “chryselectrum,”[3177] the colour of\r\nwhich inclines to that of amber;[3178] but only when viewed by a\r\nmorning[3179] light. The stones of Pontus are known by their lightness.\r\nSome of them are hard and reddish, while others, again, are soft and\r\nof a soiled appearance. According to Bocchus, these stones are found\r\nin Spain as well; in a spot where, according to him, fossil crystal\r\nhas been discovered, in sinking to the water-level for wells.[3180] He\r\ntells us also that he once saw a chrysolithos twelve[3181] pounds in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 44.—LEUCOCHRYSOS: FOUR VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also a stone known as “leucochrysos,”[3182] with a white vein\r\nrunning across it. To this class, too, belongs capnias;[3183] a stone\r\nalso which resembles glass in appearance; and another which reflects\r\na tint like that of saffron. These stones are imitated in glass, to\r\nsuch a degree of perfection, that it is impossible to distinguish them\r\nby the eye. The touch, however, detects the difference, the imitation\r\nbeing not so cold as the real stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 45.—MELICHRYSOS. XUTHON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this class also belongs melichrysos,[3184] a stone which has all the\r\nappearance of pure honey, seen through transparent gold. India produces\r\nthese stones, and, although hard, they are very brittle, but not\r\nunpleasing to the sight. The same country, too, produces xuthon,[3185]\r\na stone much used by the lower classes there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 46.—PÆDEROS, SANGENON, OR TENITES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the very head of the white stones is pæderos;[3186] though it may\r\nstill be questionable to which of the colours it in reality belongs.\r\nAs to the name, it has been so much bandied about among other precious\r\nstones of conspicuous beauty, that it has quite assumed the privilege\r\nof being a synonymous term[3187] for all that is charming to the eye.\r\nStill, however, there is one[3188] stone in particular which fully\r\nmerits all the commendation that might be expected for a stone with so\r\nprepossessing a name: for in itself it reunites the transparency of\r\ncrystal, the peculiar green of the sky, the deep tints of purple, and a\r\nsort of bright reflex, like that of a golden-coloured wine; a reflex,\r\nindeed, that is always the last to meet the eye, but is always crowned\r\nwith the lustrous hues of purple. The stone, in fact, has all the\r\nappearance of having been bathed in each of these tints, individually,\r\nand yet in the whole of them at once. There is no precious stone either\r\nthat has a clearer water than this, or that presents a more pleasing\r\nsweetness to the eye.\r\n\r\nPæderos of the finest quality comes from India, where it is known\r\nas “sangenon;” the next best being that of Egypt, called “tenites.”\r\nThat of third-rate quality is found in Arabia, but it is rough upon\r\nthe surface. Next, we have the stone of Pontus, the radiance of which\r\nis softer than in that of Thasos, which, in its turn, is of a more\r\nmellowed colour than the stones of Galatia, Thrace, and Cyprus. The\r\ndefects commonly found in these stones are, a want of brilliancy, a\r\nconfusion with colours which do not properly belong to them, and the\r\nother imperfections which are found in stones in general.[3189]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 47.—ASTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext among the white stones is “asteria,”[3190] a gem which holds its\r\nhigh rank on account of a certain peculiarity in its nature, it having\r\na light enclosed within, in the pupil of an eye as it were. This light,\r\nwhich has all the appearance of moving within the stone, it transmits\r\naccording to the angle of inclination at which it is held; now in one\r\ndirection, and now in another. When held facing the sun, it emits\r\nwhite rays like those of a star, and to this, in fact, it owes its\r\nname.[3191] The stones of India are very difficult to engrave, those of\r\nCarmania being preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 48.—ASTRION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf a similar white radiance is the stone that is known as\r\n“astrion,”[3192] closely resembling crystal in its nature, and found\r\nin India and upon the coasts of Pallene.[3193] In the centre of it\r\nthere shines internally a brilliant star, with a refulgence like that\r\nof the moon when full. Some will have it that this stone receives its\r\nname from the fact that, when held opposite to the stars, it absorbs\r\nthe light they emit and then returns it. The finest stones, they say,\r\nare those of Carmania, there being none more entirely free from all\r\ndefects. They add, also, that a stone of inferior quality is known as\r\n“ceraunia,”[3194] and that, in the worst of all, the light is very\r\nsimilar to that given by a lamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 49.—ASTRIOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAstriotes,[3195] too, is a stone that is highly esteemed, and\r\nZoroaster, they say, has sung its wondrous praises as an adjunct of the\r\nmagic art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 50.—ASTROBOLOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSudines says, that astrobolos[3196] resembles the eye of a fish in\r\nappearance, and that it has a radiant white refulgence when viewed in\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 51.—CERAUNIA; FOUR VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the white stones also, there is one known as “ceraunia,”[3197]\r\nwhich absorbs the brilliancy of the stars. It is of a crystalline\r\nformation, of a lustrous azure colour, and is a native of Carmania.\r\nZenothemis admits that it is white, but asserts that it has the figure\r\nof a blazing star within. Some of them, he says, are dull, in which\r\ncase it is the custom to steep them for some days in a mixture of nitre\r\nand vinegar; at the end of which period the star makes its appearance,\r\nbut gradually dies away by the end of as many months.\r\n\r\nSotacus mentions also two other varieties of ceraunia, one black and\r\nthe other red; and he says that they resemble axes in shape. Those\r\nwhich are black and round,[3198] he says, are looked upon as sacred,\r\nand by their assistance cities and fleets are attacked and taken: the\r\nname given to them is “bætyli,” those of an elongated form being known\r\nas “cerauniæ.”[3199] They make out also that there is another kind,\r\nrarely to be met with, and much in request for the practices of magic,\r\nit never being found in any place but one that has been struck by\r\nlightning.[3200]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 52.—IRIS; TWO VARIETIES OF IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next name mentioned by these authors is that of the stone called\r\n“iris;”[3201] which is found, in a fossil state, in a certain island\r\nof the Red Sea, forty miles distant from the city of Berenice. It is\r\npartly composed of crystal, and hence it is that some have called it\r\n“root of crystal.” It takes its name “iris” from the properties which\r\nit possesses; for, when struck by the rays of the sun in a covered\r\nspot, it projects upon the nearest walls the form and diversified\r\ncolours of the rainbow; continually changing its tints, and exciting\r\nadmiration by the great variety of colours which it presents. That it\r\nis hexahedral in form, like crystal, is generally agreed; but some say\r\nthat it is rough on the sides and of unequal angles; and that, when\r\nexposed to a full sun, it disperses the rays that are thrown upon it,\r\nwhile at the same time, by throwing out a certain brightness[3202]\r\nbefore it, it illumines all objects that may happen to be adjacent. The\r\nstone, however, as already stated, only presents these colours when\r\nunder cover; not as though they were in the body of the stone itself,\r\nbut, to all appearance, as if they were the result of the reflected\r\nlight upon the surface of the wall. The best kind is the one that\r\nproduces the largest arcs, with the closest resemblance to the rainbow.\r\n\r\n“Iritis” is the name of another stone, similar to the last in all other\r\nrespects, but remarkable for its extreme hardness. Horus says, in his\r\nwritings, that this stone, calcined and triturated, is a remedy for the\r\nbite of the ichneumon, and that it is a native of Persia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 53.—LEROS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone called “leros”[3203] is similar in appearance, but does not\r\nproduce the same effects. It is a crystal, with streaks of white and\r\nblack running across it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 54.—ACHATES; THE SEVERAL VARIETIES OF IT. ACOPOS; THE REMEDIES\r\nDERIVED FROM IT. ALABASTRITIS; THE REMEDIES DERIVED FROM IT. ALECTORIA.\r\nANDRODAMAS. ARGYRODAMAS. ANTIPATHES. ARABICA. AROMATITIS. ASBESTOS.\r\nASPISATIS. ATIZÖE. AUGETIS. AMPHIDANES OR CHRYSOCOLLA. APHRODISIACA.\r\nAPSYCTOS. ÆGYPTILLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now described the principal precious stones, classified\r\naccording to their respective colours, I shall proceed to mention the\r\nrest of them in their alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n(10.) Achates[3204] was a stone formerly in high esteem, but now\r\nheld in none. It was first found in Sicily, near a river of that\r\nname; but has since been discovered in numerous other localities. In\r\nsize it exceeds any other stones of this class, and the varieties of\r\nit are numerous, the name varying accordingly. Thus, for example,\r\nwe have iaspachates,[3205] cerachates,[3206] smaragdachates,[3207]\r\nhæmachates,[3208] leucachates,[3209] dendrachates,[3210] marked with\r\nsmall shrubs, as it were; autachates,[3211] which when burnt has a\r\nsmell like that of myrrh; and coralloachates,[3212] spotted all over,\r\nlike sapphiros, with drops of gold, and commonly found in Crete, where\r\nit is also known as “sacred” achates. This last, it is thought, is good\r\nfor wounds inflicted by spiders and scorpions; a property which I could\r\nreally believe to belong to the stones of Sicily, for, the moment they\r\nbreathe the air of that province, scorpions lose their venom.\r\n\r\nThe stones, too, that are found in India are possessed of similar\r\nproperties, and of other great and marvellous properties as well; for\r\nthey present the appearance in them of rivers,[3213] woods,[3214]\r\nbeasts of burden, and forms even, like ivy[3215] and the trappings of\r\nhorses. Medical men, too, make grinding-hones[3216] of these stones,\r\nand indeed the very sight of them is beneficial for the eyes: held\r\nin the mouth, they allay thirst. Those found in Phrygia have no\r\ngreen in them, and those of Thebes in Egypt are destitute of red and\r\nwhite veins. These last are good as a counterpoison to the venom of\r\nthe scorpion, and the stones of Cyprus are held in similar repute.\r\nSome persons set the highest value upon those stones which present a\r\ntransparency like that of glass. They are found also in Trachinia, in\r\nthe vicinity of Mount Œta, upon Mount Parnassus, in the Isle of Lesbos,\r\nin Messene, where they resemble the flowers that grow in the hedges,\r\nand at Rhodes.\r\n\r\nThe magicians make other distinctions in reference to these stones:\r\nthose, they tell us, which have spots upon them like the spots on the\r\nlion’s skin, are efficacious as a protection against scorpions; and\r\nin Persia, they say, these stones are used, by way of fumigation,\r\nfor arresting tempests and hurricanes, and for stopping the course\r\nof rivers, the proof of their efficacy being their turning the water\r\ncold, if thrown into a boiling cauldron. To be duly efficacious, they\r\nmust be attached to the body with hairs from a lion’s mane. The hair,\r\nhowever, of the hyæna is held in abomination for this purpose, as being\r\na promoter of discord in families. The stone that is of an uniform\r\ncolour renders athletes invincible, they say: the way of testing it is\r\nto throw it, along with colouring matter, into a pot full of oil; after\r\nbeing kept for a couple of hours gently on the boil, if genuine, it\r\nwill impart an uniform colour of vermilion to the mixture.\r\n\r\nAcopos[3217] is a stone like nitre[3218] in appearance, porous,\r\nand starred with drops of gold: gently boiled with oil and applied\r\nas an unguent, it relieves lassitude, if we choose to believe it.\r\nAlabastritis[3219] is a stone which comes from Alabastron in Egypt\r\nand Damascus in Syria: it is of a white colour, spotted with various\r\nother tints. Calcined with fossil salt and pulverized, it is a cure\r\nfor affections of the mouth and teeth, it is said. Alectoria[3220]\r\nis the name given to a stone that is found in the crop of poultry,\r\nlike crystal in appearance, and about as large as a bean in size:\r\nMilo[3221] of Crotona, some will have it, was thought to be in the\r\nhabit of carrying this stone about him, a thing that rendered him\r\ninvincible in his athletic contests. Androdamas[3222] has the shining\r\ncolour of silver, like adamas;[3223] it is always quadrangular, like\r\nsmall cubes in shape. The magicians are of opinion that it was thus\r\nnamed from the fact that it subdues anger and violence in man. Whether\r\nargyrodamas[3224] is the same stone or not, authors do not inform us.\r\nAntipathes[3225] is a black stone, and not transparent: the mode of\r\ntesting it, is by boiling it in milk, to which, if genuine, it imparts\r\na colour like that of myrrh. A person might probably expect to find\r\nsome extraordinary virtues in this stone, seeing that, among so many\r\nother substances possessed of antipathetic properties, it is the only\r\none that bears this name. The magicians will have it that it possesses\r\nthe power of counteracting fascinations.\r\n\r\nArabica[3226] is a stone which closely resembles ivory in appearance,\r\nand, indeed, might easily be taken for it, were it not for its superior\r\nhardness: persons who have this stone about them, it is thought, will\r\nexperience a cure of diseases of the sinews. Aromatitis,[3227] too, is\r\na stone that is found in Arabia, as also in the vicinity of Phiræ in\r\nEgypt: it is always full of small stones, and like myrrh in colour and\r\nsmell, a thing that makes it much in request with ladies of rank.[3228]\r\nAsbestos[3229] is found in the mountains of Arcadia, and is of an iron\r\ncolour. Democritus informs us that aspisatis[3230] is a native of\r\nArabia, that it is of a fiery colour, and that patients should wear\r\nit attached to the body with camels’ dung; he says, too, that it is\r\nfound in the nests of certain birds[3231] in Arabia. The same writer\r\nalso mentions another stone of this name, that is found at Leucopetra\r\nin the same country, of a silver colour, radiant, and an excellent\r\npreservative against delirium. In India, he says, and on Mount Acidane\r\nin Persia, there is a stone found that is known as “atizoë,”[3232]\r\nof a silver lustre, three fingers in length, like a lentil in shape,\r\npossessed of a pleasant smell, and considered necessary by the Magi\r\nat the consecration of a king. Augetis[3233] is thought by many to be\r\nidentical with callaina.[3234] Amphidanes,[3235] which is also known as\r\n“chrysocolla,”[3236] is a stone found in that part of India where the\r\nants[3237] throw up gold, and in it there are certain square pieces,\r\nlike gold in appearance. The nature of this stone, it is asserted, is\r\nsimilar to that of the magnet; in addition to which, it is said to have\r\nthe property of increasing gold.\r\n\r\nAphrodisiaca[3238] is a stone of a reddish white colour.\r\nApsyctos,[3239] when heated by fire, retains the warmth so long as\r\nseven days; it is black and ponderous, and is streaked with red\r\nveins. It is good too, it is thought, as a preservative against cold.\r\nAccording to Iacchus, Ægyptilla[3240] is a kind of white and black\r\nsarda, intersected with veins; but the stone commonly known by that\r\nname is black at the lower part, and azure on the surface. It takes its\r\nname from the country that produces it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 55.—BALANITES. BATRACHITIS. BAPTES. BELI OCULUS. BELUS.\r\nBAROPTENUS OR BARIPPE. BOTRYITIS. BOSTRYCHITIS. BUCARDIA. BRONTEA.\r\nBOLOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf balanites[3241] there are two kinds, the one of a greenish hue,\r\nand the other like Corinthian bronze in appearance; the former comes\r\nfrom Coptos, and the latter from Troglodytica. They are both of them\r\nintersected by a flame-like vein, which runs through the middle.\r\nCoptos, too, sends us batrachitis;[3242] one kind of which is like a\r\nfrog in colour, another has the tint of ebony, and a third is blackish\r\ninclining to red. Baptes[3243] is a soft stone, and of a most excellent\r\nsmell. Beli oculus[3244] is a stone of a whitish hue, surrounding a\r\nblack pupil in the middle, which shines amid a lustre like that of\r\ngold. This stone, in consequence of its singular beauty, has been\r\nconsecrated to the deity[3245] held in the highest veneration by the\r\npeople of Assyria. According to Democritus, there is also a stone\r\ncalled belus, and found at Arbela; it is about the size of a walnut,\r\nand looks[3246] like glass. Baroptenus or barippe is black, and\r\ncovered with knots of a white and blood-red colour: the use of it as\r\nan amulet is avoided, as being apt to produce monstrosities.\r\n\r\nBotryitis[3247] is sometimes black and sometimes purple-red,[3248]\r\nand resembles a bunch of grapes[3249] in form, when making its first\r\nappearance. Zoroaster says, that bostrychitis[3250] is a stone which\r\nis more like the hair of females than anything else. Bucardia[3251]\r\nresembles an ox-heart in appearance, and is only found at Babylon.\r\nBrontea[3252] is a stone like the head of a tortoise, which falls with\r\nthunder, it is supposed: if too, we are to believe what is said, it has\r\nthe property of quenching the fire in objects that have been struck by\r\nlightning. Bolos[3253] is the name of a stone found in Iberia,[3254]\r\nsimilar to a clod of earth in appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 56.—CADMITIS. CALLAIS. CAPNITIS. CAPPADOCIA. CALLAICA.\r\nCATOCHITIS. CATOPTRITIS. CEPITIS OR CEPOLATITIS. CERAMITIS. CINÆDIA.\r\nCERITIS. CIRCOS. CORSOÏDES. CORALLOACHATES. CORALLIS. CRATERITIS.\r\nCROCALLIS. CYITIS. CHALCOPHONOS. CHELIDONIA. CHELONIA. CHELONITIS.\r\nCHLORITIS. CHOASPITIS. CHRYSOLAMPIS. CHRYSOPIS. CEPONIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCadmitis differs only from the stone that is known as ostracitis[3255]\r\nin being sometimes surrounded with blisters of an azure colour.\r\nCallais[3256] is like sapphiros[3257] in colour, only that it is\r\npaler and more closely resembles the tint of the water near the\r\nsea-shore in appearance. Capnitis,[3258] in the opinion of some,\r\nis a peculiar species of stone: it is covered with numerous spiral\r\nstreaks, of a smoky colour, as already[3259] stated in the appropriate\r\nplace. Cappadocia[3260] is a native of Phrygia, and resembles ivory\r\nin appearance. Callaica[3261] is the name given to a stone like a\r\nclouded callaina;[3262] a number of them are always found united, it\r\nis said. Catochitis[3263] is a stone found in Corsica, of larger size\r\nthan the other precious stones; and of a more wonderful nature, if the\r\nstory is true, that it retains the hand like gum, when placed upon it.\r\nCatoptritis[3264] is found in Cappadocia, and, from its whiteness,\r\nreflects figures like a mirror. Cepitis[3265] or cepolatitis is a white\r\nstone, with veins upon it uniting together. Ceramitis[3266] has a\r\ncolour like that of earthenware.\r\n\r\nCinædia[3267] is a stone found in the brain of a fish[3268] of a\r\ncorresponding name. It is white and oblong, and possessed of marvellous\r\nvirtues, if we are to put faith in what is said, that it announces\r\nbefore-hand whether the sea will be tranquil or stormy.[3269]\r\nCeritis[3270] is a stone like wax: circos[3271] resembles the plumage\r\nof the hawk: corsoides[3272] is like white hair in appearance.\r\nCoralloachates[3273] is very similar to coral, marked with drops of\r\ngold; and corallis, a native of India and Syene, resembles minium[3274]\r\nin appearance. Crateritis[3275] is in colour a medium between\r\nchrysolithos[3276] and amber, and is remarkable for its hardness.\r\nCrocallis[3277] is a gem like the cherry in its tints. Cyitis[3278]\r\nis a stone found in the vicinity of Coptos; it is white, and to all\r\nappearance has an embryo stone within, the rattling of which may be\r\nheard on shaking it. Chalcophonos[3279] is a black stone, but when\r\nstruck it clinks like brass: tragic actors are recommended to carry\r\nit about them. Of chelidonia[3280] there are two varieties, both\r\nresembling the swallow in colour: one of them is purple on one side,\r\nand the other is purple besprinkled with black spots. Chelonia[3281]\r\nis the eye of the Indian tortoise, and is the most marvellous of all\r\nthe stones, if we believe the lying stories told by the magicians. For,\r\naccording to them, this stone, placed upon the tongue after rinsing\r\nthe mouth with honey, will ensure power of divination, if this is done\r\nat full moon or new moon, for one whole day. If, however, this plan\r\nis adopted while the moon is on the increase, the power of divination\r\nwill be acquired before sun-rise only, and if upon other days, from the\r\nfirst[3282] hour to the sixth.\r\n\r\nChelonitis,[3283] too, is a stone that resembles the tortoise[3284] in\r\nappearance, and the many virtues of which are talked of for calming\r\nstorms and tempests. As to the one that has all the appearance of\r\nbeing sprinkled with spots of gold, if thrown with a scarabæus into\r\nboiling water, it will raise a tempest, they say. Chloritis[3285] is a\r\nstone of a grass-green colour: according to the magicians, it is found\r\nin the crop of the motacilla,[3286] being engendered with the bird.\r\nThey recommend also that it should be set in iron, for the purpose\r\nof working certain portentous marvels which they promise, as usual.\r\nChoaspitis is a stone so called from the river Choaspes,[3287] of a\r\nbrilliant, golden colour mixed with green. Chrysolampis[3288] is a\r\nnative of Æthiopia, and is pale by day, but of a fiery lustre by night.\r\nChrysopis[3289] has all the appearance of gold.[3290] Ceponides[3291]\r\nis found at Atarna, a borough, and once a city, of Æolis. It is\r\ntransparent, presents numerous tints, and has sometimes the appearance\r\nof glass, sometimes of crystal, and sometimes of iaspis. Indeed, the\r\nstones of this kind that are tarnished even, are possessed of such\r\nsingular brilliancy as to reflect objects like a mirror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 57.—DAPHNEA. DIADOCHOS. DIPHYES. DIONYSIAS. DRACONITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDaphnea[3292] is mentioned by Zoroaster as curative of epilepsy.\r\nDiadochos[3293] is a stone that resembles the beryl. Of diphyes[3294]\r\nthere are two kinds, the white and the black, male and female, with a\r\nline dividing the characteristics of either sex. Dionysias[3295] is\r\nhard and black, and covered with red spots. Triturated in water, this\r\nstone imparts to it the flavour of wine, and it is generally thought to\r\nbe a preservative against intoxication. Draconitis[3296] or dracontia\r\nis a stone produced from the brain of the dragon;[3297] but unless the\r\nhead of the animal is cut off while it is alive, the stone will not\r\nassume the form of a gem, through spite on the part of the serpent,\r\nwhen finding itself at the point of death: hence it is that, for this\r\npurpose, the head is cut off when it is asleep.[3298]\r\n\r\nSotacus, who tells us that he once saw a stone of this kind in the\r\npossession of a king, says that persons go in search of it in a chariot\r\ndrawn by two horses; and that, the moment they see the serpent, they\r\nstrew narcotic drugs in its way, and then cut off its head when asleep.\r\nAccording to him, this stone is white and pellucid, and admits of no\r\npolishing or engraving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 58.—ENCARDIA OR ARISTE. ENORCHIS. EXEBENUS. ERYTHALLIS. EROTYLOS.\r\nAMPHICOMOS, OR HIEROMNEMON. EUMECES. EUMITHRES. EUPETALOS. EUREOS.\r\nEUROTIAS. EUSEBES. EPIMELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stone encardia[3299] is also called “ariste.”[3300] There are\r\nthree varieties of it; one of a black colour, with a figure in relief\r\nupon it like a heart; a second of a green colour, and like a heart in\r\nshape; and a third, with a black heart upon it, the rest of the stone\r\nbeing white. Enorchis[3301] is a white stone, the fragments of which,\r\nwhen it is split asunder, resemble the testes in shape. Exebenus,\r\nZoroaster tells us, is a white, handsome stone, employed by goldsmiths\r\nfor polishing gold. Erythallis,[3302] though a white stone, assumes a\r\nred hue when viewed at an inclined angle. Erotylos,[3303] also known\r\nas “amphicomos”[3304] and “hieromnemon,”[3305] is highly praised by\r\nDemocritus for its use in the art of divination.\r\n\r\nEumeces[3306] is a stone of Bactriana, like silex in appearance;\r\nplaced beneath the head, it produces visions in the night of an\r\noracular description. Eumithres[3307] is called by the Assyrians\r\n“gem of Belus,”[3308] the most sacred of all their gods; it is of a\r\nleek-green colour, and greatly in request for superstitious purposes.\r\nEupetalos[3309] is a stone that has four different tints, azure, fiery,\r\nvermilion, and apple-colour. Eureos[3310] is similar to an olive-stone\r\nin form, streaked like a shell, and moderately white. Eurotias[3311]\r\nhas all the appearance of concealing its black colour beneath a coat\r\nof mould. Eusebes[3312] is the stone, it is said, of which the seat was\r\nmade in the Temple of Hercules at Tyrus, from which the pious [only]\r\ncould raise themselves without difficulty. Epimelas[3313] is a white\r\ngem, with a black hue reflected from its surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 59.—GALAXIAS. GALACTITIS, LEUCOGÆA, LEUCOGRAPHITIS, OR\r\nSYNNEPHITIS. GALLAICA. GASSINADE. GLOSSOPETRA. GORGONIA. GONIÆA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGalaxias,[3314] by some called “galactitis,”[3315] is a stone that\r\nclosely resembles those next mentioned, but is interspersed with\r\nveins of blood-red or white. Galactitis[3316] is of the uniform\r\ncolour of milk; other names given to it are, leucogæa,[3317]\r\nleucographitis,[3318] and synnephitis,[3319] and, when pounded in\r\nwater, both in taste and colour it marvellously resembles milk.\r\nThis stone promotes the secretion of the milk in nursing women, it\r\nis said; in addition to which, attached to the neck of infants, it\r\nproduces saliva, and it dissolves when put into the mouth. They say,\r\ntoo, that it deprives persons of their memory: it is in the rivers\r\nNilus and Acheloüs that it is produced. Some persons give the name of\r\n“galactitis” to a smaragdus surrounded with veins of white. Gallaica\r\nis a stone like argyrodamas,[3320] but of a somewhat more soiled\r\nappearance; these stones are found in twos and threes clustered\r\ntogether. The people of Media send us gassinade,[3321] a stone like\r\norobus in colour, and sprinkled with flowers, as it were: it is found\r\nat Arbela. This stone, too, conceives,[3322] it is said; a fact which\r\nit admits when shaken; the conception lasting for a period of three\r\nmonths. Glossopetra,[3323] which resembles the human tongue, is not\r\nengendered, it is said, in the earth, but falls from the heavens\r\nduring the moon’s eclipse; it is considered highly necessary for the\r\npurposes of selenomancy.[3324] To render all this however, still\r\nmore incredible, we have the evident untruthfulness of one assertion\r\nmade about it, that it has the property of silencing the winds.\r\nGorgonia[3325] is nothing but a coral, which has been thus named\r\nfrom the circumstance that, though soft in the sea, it afterwards\r\nassumes the hardness of stone: it has the property of counteracting\r\nfascinations,[3326] it is said. Goniæa,[3327] it is asserted, and with\r\nthe same degree of untruthfulness, ensures vengeance upon our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 60.—HELIOTROPIUM. HEPHÆSTITIS. HERMUAIDOION. HEXECONTALITHOS.\r\nHIERACITIS. HAMMITIS. HAMMONIS CORNU. HORMISCION. HYÆNIA. HÆMATITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeliotropium[3328] is found in Æthiopia, Africa, and Cyprus: it is\r\nof a leek-green colour, streaked with blood-red veins. It has been\r\nthus named,[3329] from the circumstance that, if placed in a vessel\r\nof water and exposed to the full light of the sun, it changes to a\r\nreflected colour like that of blood; this being the case with the stone\r\nof Æthiopia more particularly. Out of the water, too, it reflects the\r\nfigure of the sun like a mirror, and it discovers eclipses of that\r\nluminary by showing the moon passing over its disk. In the use of\r\nthis stone, also, we have a most glaring illustration of the impudent\r\neffrontery of the adepts in magic, for they say that, if it is combined\r\nwith the plant[3330] heliotropium, and certain incantations are then\r\nrepeated over it, it will render the person invisible who carries it\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nHephæstitis[3331] also, though a radiant stone, partakes of the\r\nproperties of a mirror in reflecting objects. The mode of testing\r\nit is to put it into boiling water, which should immediately become\r\ncold. If exposed to the rays of the sun, it should instantly cause\r\ndry fuel to ignite:[3332] Corycus[3333] is the place where it is\r\nfound. Hermuaidoion[3334] is so called from the resemblance to\r\nthe male organs which it presents, on a ground that is sometimes\r\nwhite, sometimes black, and sometimes of a pallid hue, with a circle\r\nsurrounding it of a golden colour. Hexecontalithos[3335] receives\r\nits name from the numerous variety of colours which, small as it is,\r\nit presents: it is found in Troglodytica.[3336] Hieracitis[3337] is\r\nentirely covered with mottled streaks, resembling a kite’s feathers\r\nalternately with black. Hammitis[3338] is similar in appearance to\r\nthe spawn of fish: there is also one variety of it which has all\r\nthe appearance of being composed of nitre,[3339] except that it is\r\nremarkably hard. Hammonis cornu[3340] is reckoned among the most sacred\r\ngems of Æthiopia; it is of a golden colour, like a ram’s horn in shape,\r\nand ensures prophetic dreams, it is said.\r\n\r\nHormiscion[3341] is one of the most pleasing stones to the sight;\r\nit is of a fiery colour, and emits rays like gold, tipped at the\r\nextremity with a whitish light. Hyænia[3342] is derived from the eyes\r\nof the hyæna, it is said, the animal being hunted to obtain it; placed\r\nbeneath the tongue, if we believe the story, it will enable a person\r\nto prophesy the future. Hæmatitis,[3343] of the very finest quality,\r\ncomes from Æthiopia, but it is found in Arabia and Africa as well.\r\nIt is a stone of a blood-red colour, and we must not omit to mention\r\nthe assurance given [by the magicians], that the possession of it\r\nreveals treacherous designs on the part of the barbarians. Zachalias\r\nof Babylon, in the books which he dedicated to King Mithridates,\r\nattributing the destinies of man to certain properties innate in\r\nprecious stones, is not content with vaunting the merits of this stone\r\nas curative of diseases of the eyes and liver, but recommends it also\r\nas ensuring success to petitions addressed to kings. He also makes it\r\nplay its part in lawsuits and judgments, and even goes so far as to\r\nsay that it is highly beneficial to be rubbed with it on the field of\r\nbattle. There is another stone of the same class, called “menui” by the\r\npeople of India, and “xanthos”[3344] by the Greeks: it is of a whitish,\r\ntawny colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 61.—IDÆI DACTYLI. ICTERIAS. JOVIS GEMMA. INDICA. ION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stones called Idæi dactyli,[3345] and found in Crete, are of an\r\niron colour, and resemble the human thumb in shape. The colour of\r\nicterias[3346] resembles that of livid skin, and hence it is that it\r\nhas been thought so excellent a remedy for jaundice. There is also\r\nanother stone of this name, of a still more livid colour; while a\r\nthird has all the appearance of a leaf. This last is broader than the\r\nothers, almost imponderous, and streaked with livid veins. A fourth\r\nkind again is of the same colour, but blacker, and marked all over with\r\nlivid veins. Jovis gemma[3347] is a white stone, very light, and soft:\r\nanother name given to it is “drosolithos.”[3348] Indica[3349] retains\r\nthe name of the country that produces it: it is a stone of a reddish\r\ncolour, and yields a purple liquid[3350] when rubbed. There is another\r\nstone also of this name, white, and of a dusty appearance. Ion[3351] is\r\nan Indian stone, of a violet tint: it is but rarely, however, that it\r\nis found of a deep, full, colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 62.—LEPIDOTIS. LESBIAS. LEUCOPHTHALMOS. LEUCOPŒCILOS.\r\nLIBANOCHRUS. LIMONIATIS. LIPAREA. LYSIMACHOS. LEUCOCHRYSOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLepidotis[3352] is a stone of various colours, and resembles the\r\nscales of fish in appearance. Lesbias, so called from Lesbos which\r\nproduces it, is a stone found in India as well. Leucophthalmos,[3353]\r\nwhich in other respects is of a reddish hue, presents all the\r\nappearance of an eye, in white and black. Leucopœcilos[3354] is white,\r\nvariegated with drops of vermilion of a golden hue. Libanochrus[3355]\r\nstrongly resembles frankincense, and yields a liquid like honey.\r\nLimoniatis[3356] would appear to be the same as smaragdus; and all\r\nthat we find said about liparea[3357] is, that employed in the form\r\nof a fumigation, it allures all kinds of wild beasts. Lysimachos\r\nresembles Rhodian marble, with veins of gold: in polishing it, it is\r\nreduced very considerably in size, in order to remove all defects.\r\nLeucochrysos[3358] is a kind of chrysolithos interspersed with white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 63.—MEMNONIA. MEDIA. MECONITIS. MITHRAX. MOROCHTHOS. MORMORION OR\r\nPROMNION. MURRHITIS. MYRMECIAS. MYRSINITIS. MESOLEUCOS. MESOMELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat kind of stone memnonia[3359] is, we do not find mentioned.\r\nMedea[3360] is a black stone, said to have been discovered by\r\nthe Medea[3361] of fable: it has veins of a golden lustre, and\r\nyields a liquid like saffron in colour and with a vinous flavour.\r\nMeconitis[3362] strongly resembles poppies. Mithrax[3363] comes\r\nfrom Persia and the mountains of the Red Sea: it is of numerous\r\ncolours, and reflects various tints when exposed to the sun.[3364]\r\nMorochthos[3365] is a stone of a leek-green colour, from which a milk\r\nexudes. Mormorion[3366] is a transparent stone from India, of a deep\r\nblack colour, and known also as “promnion.” When it has a mixture of\r\nthe colour[3367] of carbunculus, it is from Alexandria; and when it\r\nshares that of sarda,[3368] it is a native of Cyprus. It is found also\r\nat Tyrus and in Galatia; and, according to Xenocrates, it has been\r\ndiscovered at the foot of the Alps. These stones are well adapted for\r\ncutting in relief.[3369] Murrhitis[3370] has just the colour of myrrh,\r\nand very little of the appearance of a gem: it has the odour also of an\r\nunguent, and smells like nard when rubbed. Myrmecias[3371] is black,\r\nand has excrescences upon it like warts. Myrsinitis[3372] has a colour\r\nlike that of honey, and the smell of myrtle. “Mesoleucos”[3373] is\r\nthe name given to a stone when a white line runs through the middle;\r\nand when a black vein intersects any other colour, it is called\r\n“mesomelas.”[3374]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 64.—NASAMONITIS. NEBRITIS. NIPPARENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNasamonitis is a blood-red stone, marked with black veins. Nebritis,\r\na stone sacred to Father Liber,[3375] has received its name from its\r\nresemblance to a nebris.[3376] There is also another stone of this\r\nkind, that is black. Nipparene[3377] bears the name of a city and\r\npeople of Persia, and resembles the teeth of the hippopotamus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 65.—OICA. OMBRIA OR NOTIA. ONOCARDIA. ORITIS OR SIDERITIS.\r\nOSTRACIAS. OSTRITIS. OPHICARDELON. OBSIAN STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOica is the barbarian name given to a stone which is pleasing for its\r\ncolours, black, reddish yellow, green, and white. Ombria,[3378] by\r\nsome called “notia,”[3379] falls with showers and lightning, much in\r\nthe same manner as ceraunia[3380] and brontea,[3381] the properties\r\nof which it is said to possess. There is a statement also, that if\r\nthis stone is placed upon altars it will prevent the offerings from\r\nbeing consumed. Onocardia[3382] is like kermesberry in appearance,\r\nbut nothing further is said about it. Oritis,[3383] by some called\r\n“sideritis,”[3384] is a stone of globular form, and proof against\r\nthe action of fire. Ostracias,[3385] or ostracitis, is a testaceous\r\nstone, harder than ceramitis,[3386] and similar in all respects to\r\nachates,[3387] except that the latter has an unctuous appearance when\r\npolished: indeed, so remarkably hard is ostracitis, that with fragments\r\nof it other gems are engraved. Ostritis[3388] receives its name from\r\nits resemblance to an oyster-shell. Ophicardelon is the barbarian name\r\nfor a stone of a black colour, terminated by a white line on either\r\nside. Of Obsian[3389] stone we have already spoken in the preceding\r\nBook. There are gems, too, of the same name and colour, found not only\r\nin Æthiopia and India, but in Samnium as well, and, in the opinion of\r\nsome, upon the Spanish shores that lie towards the Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 66.—PANCHRUS. PANGONUS. PANEROS OR PANERASTOS. PONTICA; FOUR\r\nVARIETIES OF IT. PHLOGINOS OR CHRYSITIS. PHŒNICITIS. PHYCITIS.\r\nPERILEUCOS. PÆNITIS OR GÆANIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPanchrus[3390] is a stone which displays nearly every colour.\r\nPangonus[3391] is no longer than the finger: the only thing that\r\nprevents it from being taken for a crystal, is, its greater number of\r\nangles. What kind of stone paneros[3392] is, Metrodorus does not inform\r\nus; but he gives some lines, by no means without elegance, that were\r\nwritten upon this stone by Queen Timaris, and dedicated to Venus; from\r\nwhich we have reason to conclude that certain fecundating virtues were\r\nattributed to it. By some writers it is called panerastos.[3393] Of\r\nthe stone called “pontica”[3394] there are numerous varieties: one is\r\nstellated, and presents either blood-red spots, or drops like gold,\r\nbeing reckoned in the number of the sacred stones. Another, in place of\r\nstars, has streaks of the same colour, and a fourth presents all the\r\nappearance of mountains and valleys.\r\n\r\nPhloginos,[3395] also called “chrysitis,”[3396] strongly resembles\r\nAttic ochre,[3397] and is found in Egypt. Phœnicitis[3398] is a stone\r\nso called from its resemblance to a date. Phycitis receives its name\r\nfrom its resemblance to sea-weed.[3399] Perileucos[3400] is the name\r\ngiven to a gem, in which a white colour runs down from the margin of\r\nthe stone to the base. Pæanitis,[3401] by some called “gæanis,”[3402]\r\nconceives, it is said, and is good for females at the time of\r\nparturition: this stone is found in Macedonia, near the monument[3403]\r\nof Tiresias there, and has all the appearance of congealed water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 67.—SOLIS GEMMA. SAGDA. SAMOTHRACIA. SAURITIS. SARCITIS.\r\nSELENITIS. SIDERITIS. SIDEROPŒCILOS. SPONGITIS. SYNODONTITIS. SYRTITIS.\r\nSYRINGITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolis gemma[3404] is white, and, like the luminary from which it takes\r\nits name, emits brilliant rays in a circular form. Sagda is found\r\nby the people of Chaldæa adhering to ships, and is of a leek-green\r\ncolour. The Isle of Samothrace gives its name to a stone[3405] which\r\nit produces, black and imponderous, and similar to wood in appearance.\r\nSauritis[3406] is found, they say, in the belly of the green lizard,\r\ncut asunder with a reed. Sarcitis[3407] is a stone, like beef in\r\nappearance. Selenitis[3408] is white and transparent, with a reflected\r\ncolour like that of honey. It has a figure within it like that of the\r\nmoon, and reflects the face of that luminary, if what we are told\r\nis true, according to its phases, day by day, whether on the wane\r\nor whether on the increase: this stone is a native of Arabia, it is\r\nthought. Sideritis[3409] is a stone like iron, the presence of which\r\nin lawsuits creates discord. Sideropœcilos,[3410] which is a variety of\r\nthe same stone, is a native of Æthiopia, and is covered with variegated\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nSpongitis has its name from its resemblance to sponge. Synodontitis\r\nis a stone found in the brain of the fish known as “synodus.”[3411]\r\nSyrtitis is a stone that used formerly to be found on the shores of the\r\nSyrtes,[3412] though now it is found on the coasts of Lucania as well:\r\nit is of a honey colour, with a reflected tint of saffron, and contains\r\nstars of a feeble lustre within. Syringitis[3413] is hollow throughout,\r\nlike the space between the two joints in a straw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 68.—TRICHRUS. THELYRRHIZOS. THELYCARDIOS OR MULC. THRACIA; THREE\r\nVARIETIES OF IT. TEPHRITIS. TECOLITHOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrichrus[3414] comes from Africa: it is of a black colour, but yields\r\nthree different liquids, black at the lower part, blood-red in the\r\nmiddle, and of an ochre colour at the top. Thelyrrhizos[3415] is of an\r\nashy or russet colour, but white at the lower part. Thelycardios[3416]\r\nis like a heart in colour, and is held in high esteem by the people\r\nof Persia, in which country it is found: the name given to it by them\r\nis “mulc.” Of thracia[3417] there are three varieties; a green stone,\r\none of a more pallid colour, and a third with spots like drops of\r\nblood. Tephritis[3418] is crescent-shaped, with horns like those of the\r\nnew moon, but it is of an ashy colour. Tecolithos[3419] has all the\r\nappearance of an olive stone: it is held in no estimation as a gem, but\r\na solution of it will break and expel urinary calculi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 69.—VENERIS CRINES. VEIENTANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nVeneris crines[3420] is the name given to a stone that is remarkably\r\nblack and shining, with an appearance like red hair within. Veientana\r\nis an Italian stone, found at Veii: it is black, divided by a line of\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 70.—ZATHENE. ZMILAMPIS. ZORANISCÆA.\r\n\r\n\r\nZathene, according to Democritus, is a native of Media. It is like\r\namber in colour, and, if beaten up with palm-wine and saffron, it will\r\nbecome soft like wax, yielding a very fragrant smell. Zmilampis is\r\nfound in the river Euphrates: it resembles marble of Proconnesus in\r\nappearance, and is of a sea-green colour within. Zoraniscæa is found\r\nin the river Indus: it is a stone used by magicians, it is said, but I\r\nfind no further particulars relative to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 71. (11.)—PRECIOUS STONES WHICH DERIVE THEIR NAMES FROM\r\nVARIOUS PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY. HEPATITIS. STEATITIS. ADADUNEPHROS.\r\nADADUOPHTHALMOS. ADADUDACTYLOS. TRIOPHTHALMOS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also another method of classifying stones; according to\r\nthe resemblance which they bear to various other objects. Thus,\r\nfor example, the different parts of the body give the following\r\nnames to stones:—Hepatitis[3421] is so called from the liver; and\r\nsteatitis[3422] from its resemblance to the fat of various animals.\r\nAdadunephros, adaduophthalmos, and adadudactylos, mean “kidney of\r\nAdad,” “eye of Adad,” and “finger of Adad,” a god[3423] of the Syrians\r\nso called. Triophthalmos[3424] is a stone found in conjunction with\r\nonyx, which resembles three human eyes at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 72.—PRECIOUS STONES WHICH DERIVE THEIR NAMES FROM ANIMALS.\r\nCARCINIAS. ECHITIS. SCORPITIS. SCARITIS. TRIGLITIS. ÆGOPHTHALMOS.\r\nHYOPHTHALMOS. GERANITIS. HIERACITIS. AETITIS. MYRMECITIS. CANTHARIAS.\r\nLYCOPHTHALMOS. TAOS. TIMICTONIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther stones, again, derive their names from various animals.\r\nCarcinias[3425] is so called from the colour of the sea-crab;\r\nechitis,[3426] from the colour of the viper; scorpitis,[3427] from\r\neither the colour or the shape of the scorpion; scaritis, from the\r\nfish called scarus;[3428] triglitis, from the sur-mullet;[3429]\r\nægophthalmos, from the eye of the goat; hyophthalmos, from the eye of\r\nthe swine; geranitis, from the neck of the crane; hieracitis, from the\r\nneck of the hawk; and aëtitis, from the colour of the white-tailed\r\neagle. Myrmecitis[3430] presents the appearance of an ant crawling\r\nwithin, and cantharias,[3431] of a scarabæus. Lycophthalmos[3432] is\r\na stone of four different colours; on the exterior it is ruddy and\r\nblood-red, and within it is black, surrounded with a line of white,\r\nclosely resembling the eye of the wolf in every respect. Taos[3433] is\r\na stone with colours like those of the peacock. Timictonia, I find, is\r\nthe name of a stone, like the asp in colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 73.—PRECIOUS STONES WHICH DERIVE THEIR NAMES PROM OTHER OBJECTS.\r\nHAMMOCHRYSOS. CENCHRITIS. DRYITIS. CISSITIS. NARCISSITIS. CYAMIAS.\r\nPYREN. PHŒNICITIS. CHALAZIAS. PYRITIS. POLYZONOS. ASTRAPÆA. PHLOGITIS.\r\nANTHRACITIS. ENHYGROS. POLYTHRIX. LEONTIOS. PARDALIOS. DROSOLITHOS.\r\nMELICHRUS. MELICHLOROS. CROCIAS. POLIAS. SPARTOPOLIAS. RHODITIS.\r\nCHALCITIS. SYCITIS. BOSTRYCHITIS. CHERNITIS. ANANCITIS. SYNOCHITIS.\r\nDENDRITIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHammochrysos[3434] resembles sand in appearance, but sand mixed with\r\ngold. Cenchritis[3435] has all the appearance of grains of millet\r\nscattered here and there. Dryitis[3436] resembles the trunk of a\r\ntree, and burns like wood. Cissitis,[3437] upon a white, transparent\r\nsurface, has leaves of ivy running all over it. Narcissitis[3438] is\r\ndistinguished by veins on the surface, and has a smell like that of the\r\nnarcissus. Cyamias[3439] is a black stone, but when broken, produces a\r\nbean to all appearance. Pyren[3440] is so called from its resemblance\r\nto an olive-stone: in some cases it would appear to contain the\r\nback-bone[3441] of a fish. Phœnicitis[3442] resembles a palm-date in\r\nform. Chalazias[3443] resembles a hailstone, both in form and colour:\r\nit is as hard as adamant, so much so, indeed, that in the fire even it\r\nretains its coolness, it is said. Pyritis,[3444] though a black stone,\r\nburns the fingers when rubbed by them. Polyzonos[3445] is a black stone\r\ntraversed by numerous zones of white.\r\n\r\nAstrapæa[3446] has rays like flashes of lightning, running across the\r\nmiddle on a ground of white or blue. In phlogitis,[3447] there is, to\r\nall appearance, a flame burning within, but not reaching the surface\r\nof the stone. In anthracitis,[3448] there are sometimes sparks, to\r\nall appearance, flying to and fro. Enhygros[3449] is always perfectly\r\nround, smooth, and white; but when it is shaken a liquid is heard to\r\nmove within, just like the yolk within an egg. Polythrix[3450] presents\r\nthe appearance of hair upon a green surface; but it causes the hair to\r\nfall off, it is said. Leontios and pardalios[3451] are names given to\r\nstones, from their resemblance to the skin of the lion and panther.\r\nDrosolithos[3452] has received its name from its colour. Melichrus\r\nis a honey-coloured stone, of which there are several varieties.\r\nMelichloros[3453] is a stone of two colours, partly honey-coloured,\r\npartly yellow. Crocias[3454] is the name given to a stone which\r\nreflects a colour like that of saffron; polias, to a stone resembling\r\nwhite hair in colour; and spartopolias, to a stone more thinly\r\nsprinkled with white.\r\n\r\nRhoditis is like the rose in colour, chalcitis resembles copper,\r\nand sycitis[3455] is in colour like a fig. Bostrychitis[3456] is\r\ncovered with branches of a white or blood-red colour, upon a ground\r\nof black; and chernitis[3457] has, on a stony surface, a figure like\r\nthat of two hands grasping each other. Anancitis[3458] is used in\r\nhydromancy, they say, for summoning the gods to make their appearance;\r\nand synochitis,[3459] for detaining the shades from below when they\r\nhave appeared. If white dendritis[3460] is buried beneath a tree\r\nthat is being felled, the edge of the axe will never be blunted,\r\nit is asserted. There are many other stones also, of a still more\r\noutrageously marvellous nature, to which, admitted as it is that they\r\nare stones, barbarous names have been given: we have refuted, however,\r\na quite sufficient number of these portentous lies already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 74. (12.)—PRECIOUS STONES THAT SUDDENLY MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE.\r\nCOCHLIDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew species of precious stones are repeatedly brought into existence,\r\nand fresh ones are found all at once, destitute of names. Thus, for\r\nexample, there was a stone formerly discovered in the gold-mines of\r\nLampsacus, which, on account of its extraordinary beauty, was sent to\r\nKing Alexander, as we learn from Theophrastus.[3461] Cochlides,[3462]\r\ntoo, which are now so common, are rather artificial productions than\r\nnatural, and in Arabia there have been found vast masses of them; which\r\nare boiled, it is said, in honey, for seven days and nights without\r\nintermission. By doing this, all earthy and faulty particles are\r\nremoved; after which, the mass, thus cleansed and purified, is adorned\r\nby the ingenuity of artists with variegated veins and spots, and cut\r\ninto such shapes as may be most to the taste of purchasers. Indeed,\r\nthese articles, in former times, were made of so large a size, that\r\nthey were employed in the East as frontals for the horses of kings, and\r\nas pendants for their trappings.[3463]\r\n\r\nAll precious stones in general are improved in brilliancy by being\r\nboiled in honey, Corsican honey more particularly; but acrid substances\r\nare in every respect injurious to them. As to the stones which are\r\nvariegated, and to which new colours are imparted by the inventive\r\ningenuity of man, as they have no name in common use, they are usually\r\nknown by that of “physis;”[3464] a name which claims for them, as it\r\nwere, that admiration which we are more ready to bestow upon the works\r\nof Nature. But really, these artificial stones have names without end,\r\nand I could never think of recounting the infinite series of them,\r\ncoined as they have been by the frivolous tendencies of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nHaving already described the more noble gems, and indeed those of\r\ninferior quality which are found among the stones that are held in\r\nhigh esteem, I must content myself with knowing that I have pointed\r\nout those kinds which are the most deserving of mention. It will be\r\nas well, however, for the reader to bear in mind, that, according to\r\nthe varying number of the spots and inequalities on their surface,\r\naccording to the numerous intersections of lines and their multiplied\r\ntints and shades, the names of precious stones are subject to repeated\r\nchanges; the material itself, for the most part, remaining just the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 75.—THE VARIOUS FORMS OF PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now make some observations in reference to precious stones in\r\ngeneral, following therein the opinions that have been expressed by\r\nvarious authors. Stones with a level surface are preferred to those\r\nwhich are concave or protuberant on the face. An oblong shape is the\r\none that is most approved of, and, next to that, the lenticular[3465]\r\nform, as it is called. After this, the stone with a plane surface and\r\ncircular is admired, those which are angular being held in the least\r\nesteem. There is considerable difficulty in distinguishing genuine\r\nstones from false; the more so, as there has been discovered a method\r\nof transforming genuine stones of one kind into false stones of\r\nanother.[3466] Sardonyx, for example, is imitated by cementing together\r\nthree other precious stones, in such a way that no skill can detect the\r\nfraud; a black stone being used for the purpose, a white stone, and one\r\nof a vermilion[3467] colour, each of them, in its own way, a stone of\r\nhigh repute. Nay, even more than this, there are books in existence,\r\nthe authors of which I forbear to name,[3468] which give instructions\r\nhow to stain crystal in such a way as to imitate smaragdus and other\r\ntransparent stones, how to make sardonyx of sarda, and other gems in a\r\nsimilar manner. Indeed, there is no kind of fraud practised, by which\r\nlarger profits are made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 76. (13.)—THE METHODS OF TESTING PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, we will make it our business to point out the methods\r\nof detecting these false stones, seeing that it is only proper to put\r\nluxury even on its guard against fraud. In addition to the particulars\r\nwhich we have already given, when treating of each individual kind\r\nof precious stone, it is generally agreed that transparent stones\r\nshould be tested by a morning light, or even, if necessary, so late\r\nas the fourth[3469] hour, but never after that hour. The modes of\r\ntesting[3470] stones are numerous: first, by their weight, the genuine\r\nstone being the heavier of the two; next, by their comparative\r\ncoolness, the genuine stone being cooler than the other to the mouth;\r\nand, next to that, by their substance; there being blisters perceptible\r\nin the body of the fictitious stone, as well as a certain roughness on\r\nthe surface; filaments, too, an unequal brilliancy, and a brightness\r\nthat falls short before it reaches the eye. The best[3471] mode of\r\ntesting is to strike off a fragment with an iron saw; but this is a\r\nthing not allowed by the dealers, who equally refuse to let their gems\r\nbe tested by the file. Dust of Obsian[3472] stone will not leave a mark\r\nupon the surface of a genuine stone: but where the gem is artificial,\r\nevery mark that is made will leave a white scratch upon it. In\r\naddition to this, there is such a vast diversity in their degrees of\r\nhardness, that some stones do not admit of being engraved with iron,\r\nand others can only be cut with a graver blunted at the edge. In all\r\ncases, however, precious stones may be cut and polished by the aid\r\nof adamas[3473] an operation which may be considerably expedited by\r\nheating the graver. The rivers which produce precious stones, are the\r\nAcesinus[3474] and the Ganges; and, of all countries, India is the most\r\nprolific of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. 77.—A COMPARATIVE VIEW OF NATURE AS SHE APPEARS IN DIFFERENT\r\nCOUNTRIES. THE COMPARATIVE VALUES OF THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now treated of all the works of Nature, it will be as well to\r\ntake a sort of comparative view of her several productions, as well\r\nas the countries which supply them. Throughout the whole earth, then,\r\nand wherever the vault of heaven extends, there is no country so\r\nbeautiful, or which, for the productions of Nature, merits so high a\r\nrank as Italy, that ruler and second parent of the world; recommended\r\nas she is by her men, her women, her generals, her soldiers, her\r\nslaves, her superiority in the arts, and the illustrious examples of\r\ngenius which she has produced. Her situation, too, is equally in her\r\nfavour; the salubrity and mildness of her climate; the easy access\r\nwhich she offers to all nations; her coasts indented with so many\r\nharbours; the propitious breezes, too, that always prevail on her\r\nshores; advantages, all of them, due to her situation, lying, as she\r\ndoes, midway between the East and the West, and extended in the most\r\nfavourable of all positions. Add to this, the abundant supply of her\r\nwaters, the salubrity of her groves, the repeated intersections of her\r\nmountain ranges, the comparative innocuousness of her wild animals, the\r\nfertility of her soil, and the singular richness of her pastures.\r\n\r\nWhatever there is that the life of man ought not to feel in want of, is\r\nnowhere to be found in greater perfection than here; the cereals, for\r\nexample, wine, oil, wool, flax, tissues, and oxen. As to horses, there\r\nare none, I find, preferred to those of Italy for the course;[3475]\r\nwhile, for mines of gold, silver, copper, and iron, so long as it\r\nwas deemed lawful to work them,[3476] Italy was held inferior to no\r\ncountry whatsoever. At the present day, teeming as she is with these\r\ntreasures, she contents herself with lavishing upon us, as the whole\r\nof her bounties, her various liquids, and the numerous flavours\r\nyielded by her cereals and her fruits. Next to Italy, if we except the\r\nfabulous regions of India, I would rank Spain, for my own part, those\r\ndistricts, at least, that lie in the vicinity of the sea.[3477] She is\r\nparched and sterile in one part, it is true; but where she is at all\r\nproductive, she yields the cereals in abundance, oil, wine, horses,\r\nand metals of every kind. In all these respects, Gaul is her equal, no\r\ndoubt; but Spain, on the other hand, outdoes the Gallic provinces in\r\nher spartum[3478] and her specular stone,[3479] the products of her\r\ndesert tracts, in her pigments that minister to our luxuries, in the\r\nardour displayed by her people in laborious employments, in the perfect\r\ntraining of her slaves, in the robustness of body of her men, and in\r\ntheir general resoluteness of character.\r\n\r\nAs to the productions themselves, the greatest value of all, among\r\nthe products of the sea, is attached to pearls: of objects that lie\r\nupon the surface of the earth, it is crystals that are most highly\r\nesteemed: and of those derived from the interior, adamas,[3480]\r\nsmaragdus,[3481] precious stones, and murrhine,[3482] are the things\r\nupon which the highest value is placed. The most costly things that are\r\nmatured by the earth, are the kermes-berry[3483] and laser;[3484] that\r\nare gathered from trees, nard[3485] and Seric tissues;[3486] that are\r\nderived from the trunks of trees, logs of citrus[3487]-wood; that are\r\nproduced by shrubs, cinnamon,[3488] cassia,[3489] and amomum;[3490]\r\nthat are yielded by the juices of trees or of shrubs, amber,[3491]\r\nopobalsamum,[3492] myrrh,[3493] and frankincense;[3494] that are found\r\nin the roots of trees, the perfumes derived from costus.[3495] The most\r\nvaluable products furnished by living animals, on land, are the teeth\r\nof elephants; by animals in the sea, tortoise-shell; by the coverings\r\nof animals, the skins which the Seres[3496] dye, and the substance\r\ngathered from the hair of the she-goats of Arabia, which we have spoken\r\nof under the name of “ladanum;”[3497] by creatures that are common to\r\nboth land and sea, the purple[3498] of the murex. With reference to\r\nthe birds, beyond plumes for warriors’ helmets, and the grease that is\r\nderived from the geese of Commagene,[3499] I find no remarkable product\r\nmentioned. We must not omit, too, to observe, that gold, for which\r\nthere is such a mania with all mankind, hardly holds the tenth rank as\r\nan object of value, and silver, with which we purchase gold, hardly the\r\ntwentieth!\r\n\r\nHAIL to thee, Nature, thou parent of all things! and do thou deign to\r\nshow thy favour unto me, who, alone of all the citizens of Rome, have,\r\nin thy every department,[3500] thus made known thy praise.[3501]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.—Facts, narratives, and observations, one thousand three\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nROMAN AUTHORS QUOTED.—M.

Ian. In a\r\nvast number of passages previously looked upon as hopelessly corrupt,\r\nor else not at all suspected of being in a mutilated state, this MS.\r\nsupplies words and clauses, the existence of which in the original was\r\nhitherto unknown; indeed by its aid the indefatigable Sillig has been\r\nenabled, if we may be allowed the term, almost to _rewrite_ the last\r\nsix Books of Pliny. From a perusal of these new readings, as Dr. Smith\r\nhas justly remarked, we have reason to infer “that the text of the\r\nearlier Books is still in a very defective state, and that much of the\r\nobscurity of Pliny may be traced to this cause.”\r\n\r\n[2] The Echeneis remora of Linnæus. See B. ix. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[3] He alludes to the “rostra,” or metal beaks, with which the prows of\r\nthe ships of war were furnished.\r\n\r\n[4] An absurd tradition, no doubt, invented, probably, to palliate the\r\ndisgrace of his defeat.\r\n\r\n[5] From the delay caused by the stoppage of the prætorian ship.\r\n\r\n[6] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[7] For Astura and Antium, see B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[8] And well it might surprise him. If there was any foundation at all\r\nfor the story, there can be little doubt that a trick was played for\r\nthe purpose of imposing upon Caligula’s superstitious credulity, and\r\nthat the rowers as well as the diving sailors were privy to it.\r\n\r\n[9] “Limax.” A singular comparison, apparently.\r\n\r\n[10] In B. ix. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[11] See B. ix. c. 41, where he is speaking of a murex, a fish which\r\nbears no such affinity to the remora as to warrant our author’s\r\nexpression, “Idem valere omnia ea genera.”\r\n\r\n[12] Properly meaning “delay.” “Remora” is another reading, and perhaps\r\na better one, as the word is found in Plautus.\r\n\r\n[13] In B. ix. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[14] From λύειν τὰς ὠδίνας, “to release from the pains of childbirth.”\r\n\r\n[15] See B. ix. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[16] Ajasson remarks that it was owing probably to this opinion that\r\nit was formerly the belief, that by holding the breath a person could\r\nrender himself proof against the shock of the torpedo; a precaution\r\nrecommended by Kæmpfer, in his “Amenitates Exoticæ,” p. 514. Ed. 1712.\r\n\r\n[17] “Quâdam aurâ sui corporis adficiat membra” seems a preferable\r\nreading to “Quâdam aurâ corporis sui adficiat membra,” as given by the\r\nBamberg MS., and adopted by Sillig.\r\n\r\n[18] See B. ix. c. 72, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[19] A fabulous story, Ajasson remarks, but one that was commonly\r\nbelieved in the 16th and 17th centuries. Gessner, however, a\r\nconscientious enquirer into the mysteries of Nature, asserts (_de\r\nAquatilibus_, p. 563) that, to his own knowledge, the sight of this\r\nfish was productive of the symptoms here mentioned. Beckmann reckons\r\nthe Aplysia depilans (with which the Sea-hare of the ancients is\r\nidentified) in the number of the animal poisons, and remarks that (as\r\nwe find stated by Cœlius Rhodiginus, B. xxvi. c. 30) the Emperor Titus\r\nwas dispatched by the agency of this poison, administered to him by the\r\ndirection of his brother Domitian. _Hist. Inv._ vol. I. p. 51. _Bohn’s\r\nEd._\r\n\r\n[20] Athenæus says, B. viii., that the Scarus pursues it and devours it.\r\n\r\n[21] “Quibus impactus est.” A curious expression; if indeed it is the\r\ncorrect reading.\r\n\r\n[22] See B. ix. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[23] Mituli. See B. ix. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[24] “Cetos.”\r\n\r\n[25] Ajasson remarks, in confutation of this story, that there are few\r\nrivers in Arabia of such a breadth.\r\n\r\n[26] See B. xi. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[27] Of this work, began by Ovid during his banishment in Pontus, and\r\nprobably never completed, only a fragment of one hundred and thirty-two\r\nlines has come down to us. Pliny again makes reference to it, in the\r\nlast Chapter of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[28] Or “Treatise on Fishes.”\r\n\r\n[29] See B. ix. c. 69, and B. xi. c. 61.\r\n\r\n[30] Quoted from the Halieuticon.\r\n\r\n[31] The wolf fish. The Perca labrax of Linnæus. See B. ix. cc. 24, 28,\r\n74, 79, and B. x. c. 89.\r\n\r\n[32] From the Halieuticon of Ovid.\r\n\r\n[33] See B. ix. cc. 14, 35, 39, 48, 74, 79, 81.\r\n\r\n[34] From the Halieuticon.\r\n\r\n[35] From the Halieuticon.\r\n\r\n[36] See B. ix. cc. 21, 26, 67.\r\n\r\n[37] From the Halieuticon.\r\n\r\n[38] From the Halieuticon. See Note 31 above, if indeed the same fish\r\nis meant. See also B. xxxi. c. 44, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[39] From the Halieuticon.\r\n\r\n[40] See B. ix. c. 85.\r\n\r\n[41] In B. ix. c. 39. Aristotle, however, as there stated, was not of\r\nthe same opinion.\r\n\r\n[42] See B. xx. c. 98.\r\n\r\n[43] “Novacula piscis.” Pliny is the only ancient author that mentions\r\nthis fish. There are numerous varieties of it, among which the\r\nbest known are the Coryphæna novacula of Linnæus, the Rason of the\r\nMediterranean, highly esteemed as an article of food, and the Coryphæna\r\npentedactyle of Bloch, identical with the _Hemiptéronote à cinq\r\ntaches_, of Lacépède.\r\n\r\n[44] An absurdity, owing, no doubt, to its name.\r\n\r\n[45] Or “globe-fish.” The Mola, orbis marinus, or sun-fish of modern\r\nNatural History, the _Lune de mer_, or _poisson-lune_ of the French.\r\nThough the skin is harsh and tough, there is no firmness in its flesh,\r\nwhich is of a gluey consistency.\r\n\r\n[46] In reality it _has_ scales, but they are almost imperceptible,\r\nfrom their minuteness.\r\n\r\n[47] Or rather, as Dalechamps observes, “all belly.”\r\n\r\n[48] See B. ix. cc. 44, 45, and B. xviii. c. 87.\r\n\r\n[49] See B. ix. cc. 1, 21 and c. 53 of the present Book. There are two\r\nvarieties of it, the Xiphias gladius of Bloch and Lacépède, and the\r\nXiphias machæra of Shaw.\r\n\r\n[50] See B. v. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[51] Martial, B. iv. Ep. 30, speaks of this being the case at the\r\nfishponds of Baiæ, where the Emperor’s fish were in the habit of making\r\ntheir appearance when called by name.\r\n\r\n[52] A village of Caria, celebrated for its sanctuary of Zeus Stratios.\r\nÆlian, Hist. Anim. B. xii. c. 30, says that there was a spring of clear\r\nwater, within the sanctuary, which contained fish with golden necklaces\r\nand rings.\r\n\r\n[53] “Inaures.” He probably means ornaments suspended from the gills, a\r\nthing which, in the case of eels, might be done.\r\n\r\n[54] “Senum delubrum.” Ælian speaks of tame fish in the Old Men’s\r\nHarbour (λιμὴν) at Chios.\r\n\r\n[55] In B. xxxi. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[56] The seat of the worship of the half-fish goddess Addirga,\r\nAtergatis, Astarte, or Derceto. See B. v. c. 19. The original names of\r\nHierapolis (the Holy City) were Bambyce and Mabog.\r\n\r\n[57] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[58] A Greek name signifying “black-tails.” See c. 53 of this Book.\r\nHolland translates it “the black-tailed ruffe” or “sea-bream.”\r\n\r\n[59] See B. v. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[60] See B. v. c. 31, and B. xxxi. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[61] See B. iii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[62] See B. v. cc. 3, 4.\r\n\r\n[63] See B. iii. cc. 16, 26.\r\n\r\n[64] Ajasson thinks that this may possibly be true to some small extent.\r\n\r\n[65] Identical with the fish called “orbis,” already mentioned in c. 5\r\nof this Book. Ajasson remarks that though these fish have been known to\r\nweigh as much as three hundred pounds, there are many others which grow\r\nto a larger size, the sturgeon, and the silurus, for instance.\r\n\r\n[66] Ajasson thinks that this notion may possibly have been derived\r\nfrom the name, which not improbably was given to it from the spongy and\r\noleaginous nature of the flesh.\r\n\r\n[67] See B. iii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[68] Owing, perhaps, to the moisture of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[69] We learn from Festus, that he prohibited the use also of the\r\nscarus, a fish _with_ scales.\r\n\r\n[70] “Ad pulvinaria.” Literally, “At the cushions;” in reference\r\nto the practice of placing the statues of the gods upon pillows at\r\nthe Lectisternia, which were sacrifices in the nature of feasts,\r\nat which images of the gods were placed reclining on couches, with\r\ntables and food before them, as if they were really partaking of the\r\nthings offered in sacrifice. Livy, B. v. c. 13. gives an account of a\r\nLectisternium celebrated with great pomp, which he asserts to have been\r\nthe first instance of the practice.\r\n\r\n[71] In B. ix. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[72] See B. iii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[73] Theophrastus reckons coral among the precious stones, and the\r\nPseudo-Orpheus among the minerals. Pliny would seem to be at a loss\r\nwhether to consider it as an animal or a vegetable. In reality it is\r\nthe production of marine organized bodies of an arborescent habit,\r\nknown as Corallina, with jointed stems, supported on a kind of root\r\ndivided into branches, which are likewise jointed.\r\n\r\n[74] Because κειρεῖται, it is “cut short” in the sea, a far-fetched\r\nderivation, apparently.\r\n\r\n[75] Solinus informs us that Zoroaster attributed certain mysterious\r\nproperties to coral.\r\n\r\n[76] A practice still retained, though the original intention of it has\r\nbeen lost sight of. As to the form of the coral now used by infants,\r\nsee Note 2171 to B. xxviii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[77] In reality, the Pastinaca or Sting-ray is _not_ venomous; but the\r\nwounds inflicted by the sting in its tail are highly dangerous, from\r\ntheir tendency to gangrene.\r\n\r\n[78] In B. ix. c. 72. As Ajasson remarks, it is quite possible that the\r\nsting of the Pastinaca might penetrate to the heart of a young tree,\r\nand so kill it; but that is no proof of its being poisonous. See also\r\nB. ix. cc. 40, 67.\r\n\r\n[79] Or Mustela, the sea-weasel, mentioned in B. ix. c. 29, and in c.\r\n37 of the present Book. See also Note 2407 to B. ix. c. 29. Ajasson is\r\nof opinion that under the names of “Galeos” and “Mustela,” the ancients\r\nconfounded the Squalus galeus and the Squalus mustelus of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[80] See B. xix. c. 15, and B. xxii. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[81] As water, and are consequently amphibious.\r\n\r\n[82] The Castoreum of the ancients, the “castor” of our Materia Medica,\r\nis _not_ in reality produced from the testes of the beaver, as was\r\nsupposed by the ancients, but from two oval pouches situate near the\r\nanus of the animal of either sex. There are four of these pouches in\r\nall, two containing a species of fat, and two larger ones including\r\nin their membranous cells a viscous fetid substance, which forms the\r\ncastor of medicine. It is considered to be an antispasmodic.\r\n\r\n[83] “Folliculos.” A very appropriate term, as Ajasson remarks.\r\n\r\n[84] See B. xii. c. 49, and B. xxxiv. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[85] See B. xxv. c. 70.\r\n\r\n[86] Castor is still given to females to inhale, when suffering from\r\nhysteria.\r\n\r\n[87] See B. xx. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[88] See B. xxiv. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[89] See B. viii. c. 41, B. x. c. 95, and B. xi. cc. 24, 28.\r\n\r\n[90] See B. xxix. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[91] See B. viii. c. 35, and B. xvi. c. 80.\r\n\r\n[92] See B. xx. c. 81; B. xxii. c. 13; B. xxiii. c. 23, and B. xxiv. c.\r\n73.\r\n\r\n[93] See B. xii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[94] Or Mistletoe; see B, xvi. c. 92.\r\n\r\n[95] As to the identity of the “nitrum” of the ancients, see B. xxxi.\r\nc. 46 and the Notes.\r\n\r\n[96] See B. xx. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[97] Under the head of “testudines,” he includes the tortoises,\r\nterrapenes, and turtles, which form an order of reptiles, known in\r\nNatural History as Chelonia, and characterised by the body being\r\nenclosed between a double shield or shell, out of which protrude the\r\nhead, tail, and four extremities.\r\n\r\n[98] See B. ix. cc. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n[99] Our tortoises so called.\r\n\r\n[100] Our Chelonides, or turtles.\r\n\r\n[101] The Emydes and Trionyches of Modern Natural History.\r\n\r\n[102] Or turtle.\r\n\r\n[103] See B. x. c. 86.\r\n\r\n[104] To make it of a yellow or golden colour, Dalechamps says.\r\n\r\n[105] Identified by Ajasson with the Emys lutaria of Modern Natural\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n[106] Our Houseleek. See B. xxv. c. 102.\r\n\r\n[107] Because it is then powerless, and can make no effort to rise.\r\n\r\n[108] An absurd story, founded, no doubt, on the extremely slow pace of\r\nthe tortoise. Ajasson remarks that it is the fresh-water tortoise, more\r\nparticularly, that is so slow in its movements.\r\n\r\n[109] In B. xxi. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[110] Or Gilt-head. “Aurata.” See B. ix. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[111] In B. viii. c. 38.

See also B.\r\nviii. cc. 13, 14, 22, 41, and B. x. cc. 5, 92, 95, 96.\r\n\r\n[116] See B. viii. c. 41, B. x. c. 95, and B. xi. cc. 24, 28, 29.\r\n\r\n[117] See B. ix. cc. 71, 86, and c. 53 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[118] See Note 115 above.\r\n\r\n[119] Rondelet asserts, B. vi. c. 19, that he himself had cured the\r\nsting of the sea-dragon by an application of the liver of that fish.\r\n\r\n[120] See B. xxix. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[121] See B. viii. c. 35, B. xi. c. 43, and B. xvi. c. 80.\r\n\r\n[122] See B. xxiii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[123] Nicander, in his Theriaca, classes the Elops among the innocuous\r\nserpents. In B. ix. c. 27, we are informed that one name given to the\r\nAcipenser was “Elops.” But see the remark made in c. 54 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[124] See B. xxiii. c. 80.\r\n\r\n[125] From c. 53 of the present Book, we learn that the Sarda was a\r\nkind of Pelamis, or young tunny, which was pickled, like our Anchovy.\r\n\r\n[126] See Note 115 above.\r\n\r\n[127] Tunny cut into slices, and pickled. See B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[128] See B. ix. cc. 40, 67, 74, 83.\r\n\r\n[129] See B. viii. c. 48, B. xi. cc. 19, 76, 116, B. xxv. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[130] See B. x. c. 86.\r\n\r\n[131] Under the name “magi,” he is probably speaking here, not of the\r\nordinary magicians, but the Magi of the East, from whom Democritus\r\nlargely borrowed.\r\n\r\n[132] A piece of wit on the part of our author, in which he seldom\r\nindulges.\r\n\r\n[133] See B. xi. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[134] From “rubus,” a “bramble.”\r\n\r\n[135] In B. viii. c. 48. It is not improbable that the “rubetæ” of the\r\nancients were toads.\r\n\r\n[136] Projections of the bones in which the eyes are set, as Dalechamps\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n[137] “Plenæ veneficiorum.” It was long a matter of doubt whether the\r\ntoad is really poisonous, but it has been recently ascertained that the\r\npustules on the skin contain a most active poison.\r\n\r\n[138] “Solium” and “oleum” are the readings here, but we adopt the\r\nconjecture of M. Ian, and substitute “ollam.”\r\n\r\n[139] “Averting dogs.”\r\n\r\n[140] The Enhydris, probably. See B. xxx. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[141] See B. xxvi. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[142] “Cancri fluviatiles.” Our crawfish, the Potamobios of Leach.\r\n\r\n[143] See B. xix. cc. 31, 36, 44, and B. xx. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[144] It is difficult to say whether he means the shrew-mouse here,\r\nthe bite of which was supposed to be poisonous, or the serpent called\r\nScytale, mentioned by Lucan, B. ix. l. 717.\r\n\r\n[145] See Note 143 above.\r\n\r\n[146] The Crab. This is giving the serpent credit for too much wisdom;\r\nan acquaintance, in fact, with the fantastic names which mankind have\r\nbestowed upon the signs of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n[147] See B. ix. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[148] The same as the Orbis or Orthagoriscus of Chapters 5 and 9 of\r\nthis Book, the Mola or sun-fish of the Mediterranean. See B. ix. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[149] Or sting-ray. See B. ix. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[150] There is considerable truth in this observation.\r\n\r\n[151] The sea-horse, the Syngnathus hippocampus of Linnæus. See B. ix.\r\nc. 1.\r\n\r\n[152] See B. xxi. c. 105.\r\n\r\n[153] The same, probably, as the “opocarpathon” of B. xxviii. c. 45, a\r\nsubstance which does not appear to have been identified with any degree\r\nof certainty. See also c. 31 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[154] B. ix. c. 79.\r\n\r\n[155] Ajasson remarks that these statements are consistent with fact.\r\n\r\n[156] “Deep-sea” oysters.\r\n\r\n[157] In Asia Minor. See B. v. c. 32, where it is called “Grynia.”\r\n\r\n[158] In Lemnos. See B. iv. c. 23, and B. v. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[159] This is an error: the statement is made, not in B. ix., but in B.\r\nii. c. 109.\r\n\r\n[160] See B. ix. c. 74. It is at the spawning season that this milky\r\nliquid is found in the oyster; a period at which the meat of the fish\r\nis considered unwholesome as food. We have a saying that the oyster\r\nshould never be eaten in the months without an r; that the same, too,\r\nwas the opinion in the middle ages is proved by the Leonine line:\r\n\r\n“Mensibus erratis vos ostrea manducatis.”\r\n\r\n“In the r’d months you may your oysters eat.”\r\n\r\n[161] See B. iii. c. 9. Horace speaks of the oysters of Circeii, B. ii.\r\nSat. 4. l. 33.\r\n\r\n[162] There has been considerable discussion among the commentators\r\nas to the meaning of the word “spondylus” here. We are inclined to\r\nadopt the opinion of Venette, and to think that it means the so-called\r\n“meat” of the oyster. It must be short, and consequently plump and\r\ncomparatively destitute of beard, and it must not be fleshy, as that\r\nwould imply a degree of toughness not desirable in an oyster. The\r\nwords “nec fibris laciniata ac tota in alvo,” only seem to be an\r\namplification of the preceding ones, “spondylo brevi et non carnoso.”\r\n\r\n[163] Literally, “Having beautiful eyebrows.”\r\n\r\n[164] See B. ix. c. 79.\r\n\r\n[165] See B. v. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[166] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[167] “Dulciora.”\r\n\r\n[168] Those of Rutupæ, the present Richborough in Kent, were highly\r\nesteemed by the Romans. See Juvenal, Sat. 4. l. 141.\r\n\r\n[169] “Suaviora.”\r\n\r\n[170] The district in the vicinity of Bordeaux, now called Medoc. The\r\noysters of Medulæ are mentioned in terms of praise by Ausonius, Epist.\r\nvii. and Epist. cxliii.\r\n\r\n[171] “Acriora.”\r\n\r\n[172] See B. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[173] See B. v. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[174] See B. iii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[175] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[176] They probably gave the name of “oyster” to some other shell-fish\r\nof large size. In Cook’s Voyages we read of cockles in the Pacific,\r\nwhich two men were unable to carry.\r\n\r\n[177] From τρὶς, “thrice,” and δάκνω, “to bite.”\r\n\r\n[178] Ajasson remarks that many persons are unable to digest oysters,\r\nin an uncooked state.\r\n\r\n[179] Ajasson remarks that calcined oyster-shells formed an ingredient\r\nin the famous lithontriptic of Mrs. Stephens, a so-called remedy which\r\nobtained for her a considerable reward, voted by the English Parliament\r\nin the middle of last century.\r\n\r\n[180] A statement purely imaginary, Ajasson thinks; the liquid of this\r\nclass of shell-fish containing no element whatever to fit it for an\r\nantidote.\r\n\r\n[181] Or antidote.\r\n\r\n[182] In B. xxvi. c. 66.\r\n\r\n[183] Many varieties of sea-weed are now known, Ajasson says, to\r\npossess this property, and are still used by savage nations for\r\ncolouring the body. In Europe, the use of indigo, madder, and other\r\ntinctorial plants of a more decided character, has caused them to be\r\nentirely neglected for dyeing purposes.\r\n\r\n[184] Probably the Syngnathus hippocampus of Linnæus. See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[185] As to the Nitrum of the ancients, see B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[186] Or Cuttlefish. See B. ix. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[187] See B. ix. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[188] See c. 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[189] This seems to be the meaning of “conchyliorum” here, though in\r\nmost instances Pliny uses it as synonymous with the purple. See B. ix.\r\ncc. 60, 61, 64.\r\n\r\n[190] See B. xxv. c. 70.\r\n\r\n[191] This assertion reminds us of the healing effects of the fish with\r\nwhich Tobit cured his father’s blindness. See Tobit, c. xi. v. 13.\r\n\r\n[192] See c. 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[193] Identified by Ajasson with the white Rascasse of the\r\nMediterranean. Hardouin combats the notion that this was the fish, the\r\ngall of which was employed by Tobit for the cure of his father, and is\r\ninclined to think that the Silurus was in reality the fish; a notion no\r\nbetter founded than the other, Ajasson thinks.\r\n\r\n[194] In his “Messenia,” for instance. The fragment has been preserved\r\nby Ælian, Hist. Anim. B. xiii. c. 4. Ajasson remarks that the ancients\r\nclearly mistook the swimming bladder of the fish for the gall.\r\n\r\n[195] Or “heaven-gazer.”\r\n\r\n[196] The original has “ab oculo quem,”—but we have adopted the reading\r\nsuggested by Dalechamps, “Ab oculis quos in superiore capite.” Ajasson\r\nsays that the white rascasse has the eyes so disposed on the upper part\r\nof the head as to have the appearance of gazing upwards at the heavens.\r\nHence it is that at Genoa, the fish is commonly known as the _prête_ or\r\n“priest.”\r\n\r\n[197] See B. ix. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[198] See Chapter 17 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[199] “Albugines.”\r\n\r\n[200] Meaning, literally, “Fallen from Jupiter,” in reference to their\r\nsupposed descent from heaven in showers of rain.\r\n\r\n[201] Cortex.\r\n\r\n[202] See B. xxxiv. cc. 22, 23.\r\n\r\n[203] “Ossiculo.”\r\n\r\n[204] Literally, “fish-glue.” We can hardly believe Pliny that any fish\r\nwas known by this name. Hardouin takes the fish here spoken of to be\r\nidentical with that mentioned in B. ix. c. 17, as being caught in the\r\nBorysthene, and destitute of bones. It is most probable, however, that\r\nthe “ichthyocolla” of the ancients, or “fish-glue,” was the same as our\r\nisinglass, and that it was prepared from the entrails of various fish,\r\nthe sturgeon more particularly, the Acipenser huso of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[205] The best isinglass still comes from Russia.\r\n\r\n[206] “Nativi coloris.” See B. viii. c. 23. Beckmann says, in reference\r\nto the present passage: “We manufacture the wool of our brown sheep in\r\nits natural colour, and this was done also by the ancients.”—_Hist.\r\nInv._ vol. ii. p. 110, _Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[207] The “calamites” above mentioned, so called from “calamus,” a reed.\r\n\r\n[208] The Bryonia Cretica of Linnæus; see B. xxiii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[209] An eminent surgeon, born at Sidon in Phœnicia, who practised at\r\nRome, probably in the first century B.C.\r\n\r\n[210] “Mutis,” “silent,” or “voiceless” frogs, as suggested by Gessner,\r\nHist. Anim. B. ii., would almost seem to be a preferable reading here\r\nto “multis,” “many.”\r\n\r\n[211] Another reading is “tænia,” a fish mentioned by Epicharmus,\r\nAthenæus informs us, and considered by Ajasson to be probably identical\r\nwith the Cepola rubescens, or Cepola tænia of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[212] The same as the Batis of the Greeks, Hardouin thinks, the Raia\r\nbatis, a kind of skate.\r\n\r\n[213] See B. ix. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[214] See the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[215] See c. 13 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[216] See B. ix. c. 71.\r\n\r\n[217] As to “nitrum,” see B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[218] See B. xxxi. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[219] See Note 189 to Chapter 23 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[220] “Canicula.” See B. ix. cc. 11, 70.\r\n\r\n[221] Or sting-ray.\r\n\r\n[222] Tunny cut in slices. See B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[223] See end of B. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[224] For the purpose, probably, of assuaging the pain of tooth-ache by\r\ntheir coolness.\r\n\r\n[225] See B. ix. cc. 40, 67.\r\n\r\n[226] “Cetum.” See B. ix. cc. 40, 74.\r\n\r\n[227] Ajasson is of opinion that here and in c. 19 Pliny has mistaken\r\nthe _otter_ for a serpent, the mammiferæ only having eye or canine\r\nteeth. Aristotle, Hist. Anim. B. i. c. i., calls the otter by the name\r\nof “Enhydris.” See B. xxx. c. 8, where Pliny speaks of the “Enhydris”\r\nas a “male white serpent.”\r\n\r\n[228] Or seal. See B. ix. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[229] See B. ix. c. 42. Holland calls the mæna the “cackerel.”\r\n\r\n[230] Or sting-ray.\r\n\r\n[231] See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[232] Much like the cod-liver oil, held in such high repute at the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n[233] “Icthyocolla.” See Chapter 24 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[234] Of course this assertion as to the nest of the kingfisher is\r\naltogether fabulous, and the sea-productions here described by Pliny\r\nwere long considered, though destitute of leaves, flowers, and fruit,\r\nto belong to the vegetable kingdom. Peyssonnel, however, made the\r\ndiscovery that they belong to the animal kingdom, and that they owe\r\ntheir origin to a species of polyp.\r\n\r\n[235] Or kingfisher. See B. x. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[236] “Oculorum cicatrices.”\r\n\r\n[237] See end of B. xx.\r\n\r\n[238] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[239] See B. ix. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[240] See B. ix. cc. 40, 67. The Bamberg MS. has here “rhine,” (the\r\nfish again mentioned in Chapter 53 of this Book) instead of “rana;” a\r\nreading which Sillig rejects. Hardouin conjectures that “raia” is the\r\ncorrect reading, the sea-frog having no sting or stickle in the tail.\r\n\r\n[241] See B. ix. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[242] Or sea-lizard, a fish again mentioned in Chapter 53 of this Book.\r\nÆlian also speaks of it, Hist. Nat. B. xii. c. 25; but it has not been\r\nhitherto identified.\r\n\r\n[243] See c. 25 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[244] See c. 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[245] See B. xxxi. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[246] See B. ix. cc. 17, 25, 75.\r\n\r\n[247] It is not clear whether he means the gum ammoniac of B. xii. c.\r\n49, and B. xxiv. c. 14, or the sal ammoniac of B. xxxi. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[248] “Saliva.” See the recipe of Sallustius Dionysius in Chapter 26 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[249] The Dryophites of Rondelet, Dalechamps says.\r\n\r\n[250] Identical with the Strombus of cc. 39, 46, and 53 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[251] See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[252] Littré remarks that Pliny here seems to speak of the “Tethea”\r\nas a mollusk; whereas in c. 31, from his expression “Fungorum verius\r\ngeneris quam piscium,” he would appear to be describing a zoophyte.\r\n\r\n[253] See B. ix. cc. 17, 25, 75.\r\n\r\n[254] See B. ix. cc. 24, 48, 67, 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[255] See B. xx. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[256] A rock fish, according to Athenæus, B. vii. Rondelet, B. vi.\r\nc. 7, identifies it with the fish called _girello_ by the people of\r\nLiguria, the _donzella_ of other districts.\r\n\r\n[257] Sliced tunny. See B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[258] A genus which comprises the “myes,” mentioned in B. ix. c. 56,\r\naccording to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[259] See B. ix. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[260] See B. xxi. c. 105.\r\n\r\n[261] See B. xxviii. c. 45, and Chapter 20 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[262] Identical with our mussel, probably.\r\n\r\n[263] Holland identifies this with the cockle, but it is probably a\r\nsmaller kind of mussel.\r\n\r\n[264] See B. xxxiv. c. 50.\r\n\r\n[265] We learn from Chapter 53 of this Book, that one class of the\r\n“Chamæ,” or gaping cockles, was known as “Pelorides.” Horace also\r\nmentions them.\r\n\r\n[266] See B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[267] See Note 251 above. Sillig would here read “tetheum,” apparently,\r\nin the singular.\r\n\r\n[268] Described in B. xxvii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[269] A city not far from the Canopic branch of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[270] “Dantur” seems a preferable reading to “datur.”\r\n\r\n[271] See B. ix c. 42.\r\n\r\n[272] Our crawfish, the Astacus potamobios of Leach.\r\n\r\n[273] See Chapter 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[274] See B. xix. c. 27, and B, xxv. c. 64.\r\n\r\n[275] See B. ix. cc. 23, 77.\r\n\r\n[276] See end of B. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[277] See B. ix. cc. 20, 24, 36.\r\n\r\n[278] See B. ix. cc. 24, 48, 67, 74, 75.\r\n\r\n[279] “Rhombus.” See B. ix. cc. 20, 36, 67, 79.\r\n\r\n[280] See Chapters 23, 34, 30 and 53 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[281] Rondelet, B. vi. c. 19, suggests “capite”—“in the head”—but the\r\npresent reading is supported by the text of Plinius Valerianus, B. ii.\r\nc. 39, and of Marcus Empiricus, c. 28.\r\n\r\n[282] As to the identity of the Enhydris, see Chapters 19 and 26 of the\r\npresent Book: also B. xxx. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[283] Probably the Βλεννὸς of Oppian, B. i. c. 108. Dalechamps\r\nidentifies it with the mullet called “myxon,” apparently the same fish\r\nas the “bacchus” mentioned in Chapter 25 of this Book. Rondelet appears\r\nto identify it with some other sea-fish, small, and extremely rare. On\r\nthe other hand, the fish mentioned by Oppian is thought by Littré to\r\nbe the “gobius” of the Latins, (“gobio” or “cobio,” mentioned by Pliny\r\nin B. ix. c. 83, and in c. 53 of the present Book), which is generally\r\nconsidered the same as our gudgeon, and was a worthless fish, “vilis\r\npiscis,” as Juvenal says. One of the Linnæan orders of fishes is called\r\n“Blennius,” the blenny.\r\n\r\n[284] See B. ix. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[285] See B. ix. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[286] Or sea-lungs.

According to Dalechamps, the name “donax” was given\r\nto one kind of scallop, from its fancied resemblance to a thick,\r\nhollow, river-reed, and that of “onyx” from the resemblance of its\r\ncolour to that of the finger-nails.\r\n\r\n[290] It is not improbable that he may mean the same animal that has\r\nbeen mentioned in cc. 19 and 26 of this Book, the Enhydris.

In his opinion, however, it is neither; but\r\nhe thinks that under this head were included seven or eight varieties\r\nof the Pickerel, the principal of which are, the Sparus smaris of\r\nLinnæus and Lacépède, the Sparus mana of Linnæus, or Sparus mendola of\r\nLacépède, and the Sparus haffara of Lacépède and Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[307] See Chapter 22 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[308] See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[309] Literally, the “little serpent.” Some think that it is the\r\nOphidium barbatum of Linnæus.

Sillig conjectures that Pliny may\r\nhave had in view the fish called “dromades” by Aristotle. “Dromones” is\r\nanother reading, a sort of small crab.\r\n\r\n[455] Littré translates this “horned ray.”\r\n\r\n[456] “Gladii.” See B. ix. cc. 1, 21; the same, probably as the\r\n“xiphias” mentioned at the end of this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[457] See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[458] See B. viii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[459] See B. viii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[460] See B. ix. c. 18, 20. Holland says, “Some take ‘thynni’ for\r\nthe milters and ‘thynnides’ for the spawners.” In this translation,\r\nhowever, he identifies the “thynnides” with the “pelamides,” or young\r\ntunnies, mentioned in this Chapter and in B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[461] See B. ix. cc. 17, 25.\r\n\r\n[462] See B. ix. cc. 24, 32.\r\n\r\n[463] “Percæ.” See B. ix. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[464] See B. ix. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[465] “Aurata.” See B. ix. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[466] See B. ix. cc. 25, 28.\r\n\r\n[467] Considered by some to be the whiting. Littré identifies it with\r\nthe Perca labrax of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[468] See B. ix. c. 74; where it is called “apua.”\r\n\r\n[469] The “sea-fox.” See B. ix. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[470] “Anguilla.” See B. ix. cc. 2, 37, 38.\r\n\r\n[471] Or sea-spider. See B. ix. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[472] The same as the _bogue_ of the coasts of Narbonne, according to\r\nRondelet, B. v. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[473] See Chapter 25 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[474] See B. ix. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[475] Or frog-fish.

Hardouin says that it is the fish called\r\n_capone_ by the people of Rome.\r\n\r\n[480] See B. ix. c. 71.\r\n\r\n[481] The same, probably, as the “gobio,” mentioned in B. ix. c. 83.\r\n\r\n[482] See B. ix. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[483] See B. ix. cc. 25, 28.\r\n\r\n[484] Thought by some to be a kind of mackerel, by others to be a\r\ntunny. Rondelet says, B. viii. c. 8, that it is a fish still called\r\n_coguiol_ by the people of Marseilles.\r\n\r\n[485] In the Hellespont.\r\n\r\n[486] Or Sexis, according to Pintianus.\r\n\r\n[487] Or “sea-lizards.”\r\n\r\n[488] See B. ix. c. 18. He surely does not intend to include this among\r\nhis “one hundred and seventy-six different kinds of aquatic animals”!\r\n\r\n[489] Or young tunny. See B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[490] See B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[491] Rondelet says, B. v. c. 4, that it is a fish still known (in\r\nhis time) as _cantheno_, by the people of Narbonne. Ovid, in his\r\nHalieuticon, l. 103, speaks of the unpleasant flavour of its juices.\r\n\r\n[492] See Chapter 24 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[493] Of course, as Hardouin says, he does not include the shell-fishes\r\nin this assertion. The fish with this uncomplimentary name has not been\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n[494] “Urtica.” See B. ix. c. 68.\r\n\r\n[495] See B. ix. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[496] Or “chamæ;” different varieties of gaping cockles.\r\n\r\n[497] Or “monster” cockles.\r\n\r\n[498] Or “sweet” cockles.\r\n\r\n[499] See Chapter 27 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[500] See B. ix. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[501] Or “cochli.” As to the various kinds of cochleæ, see B. ix. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[502] “Five-fingered.” So called from some peculiarity in their shape.\r\n\r\n[503] Considered by some to be the striated mussel, the Pecten of\r\nLinnæus.\r\n\r\n[504] “Radii.”\r\n\r\n[505] This is not improbably the meaning of the very elliptical\r\nsentence, “Quibus radii cantant.”\r\n\r\n[506] See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[507] The “dog’s-face,” literally. This fish has not been identified:\r\nindeed the reading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[508] A kind of crab or crayfish. See B. xxvii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[509] Literally, the “dog’s right hand.” This fish has not been\r\nidentified: Hardouin suggests that it may have been a zoöphyte.\r\n\r\n[510] See B. ix. c. 43, and Chapters 17 and 26 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[511] Or “little dragon.”\r\n\r\n[512] The sea-scorpion, probably.\r\n\r\n[513] See B. ix. c. 23; also Chapters 31 and 50 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[514] Or Remora.

Holland calls it a “pilchard” or “herring.”\r\n\r\n[521] A kind of squalus. See B. ix. c. 70.\r\n\r\n[522] See B. xxxi. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[523] Or “horse.” The crab, probably, mentioned in B. ix. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[524] See B. ix. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[525] Or sea-swallow. See B. ix. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[526] “Lungs of the sea.” The same as the Pulmones, or sea-lungs\r\nmentioned in B. ix. c. 71, and in Chapter 36 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[527] See B. ix. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[528] Or “sea-liver.” A sort of rock-fish, according to Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[529] The same as the “milvus” or “sea-kite,” mentioned in B. ix. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[530] See Chapter 31 of this Book. Instead of this fish and the\r\npreceding one, most of the editions mention the “elacatenes,” a\r\ncetaceous fish, according to Athenæus, much used for salting.\r\n\r\n[531] “Sea-lizards.”\r\n\r\n[532] See B. ix. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[533] “Locusta.” See B. ix. c. 50.\r\n\r\n[534] “Lucerna.” See B. ix. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[535] Neither this fish nor the “larinus” has been identified.\r\n\r\n[536] See B. ix. c. 72, and Chapter 3 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[537] See B. ix. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[538] See B. ix. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[539] See B. ix. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[540] See B. ix. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[541] See Chapter 8 of this Book.

It is in this sense that Ovid says, Metam. B. i.:\r\n“Effodiuntur opes, irritamenta malorum.” Pliny applies the term “pretia\r\nrerum” to metals, as forming the unit of value.\r\n\r\n[649] Electrum is described in c. 23, as gold mixed with a certain\r\nquantity of silver. The word “electrum” is also used to signify amber,\r\nas in B. iii. c. 30.—B.\r\n\r\n[650] “Æs;” by “æs” is here probably meant copper, as the author is\r\nspeaking of what is dug out of the earth; it is more fully described\r\nin the first two Chapters of the next Book. According to the analysis\r\nof Klaproth, the æs of the ancients, when employed in works of art,\r\ncutting instruments, statues, vases, &c., was the “bronze” of the\r\nmoderns, a mixture of copper and tin, in which the proportion of tin\r\nvaried, from a little more than 2 to 1.14 per cent, according as the\r\nobject was to procure a flexible or a hard substance. Agricola speaks\r\nof “æs” as synonymous with “cuprum,” and Pliny will be found several\r\ntimes in the present Book, speaking of “æs Cyprium,” meaning probably\r\nthe finest kind of copper, and that without alloy.—B.\r\n\r\n[651] Pliny has already referred to this topic in B. ii. c. 63.—B.\r\n\r\n[652] Or shades below.\r\n\r\n[653] “Illa quæ non nascuntur repente.”\r\n\r\n[654] “Chrysocolla” is fully described in Chapter 26 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[655] Meaning “gold glue,” or “gold solder.”\r\n\r\n[656] There is considerable variation in the text of this passage, as\r\nfound in the different editions. In that of Dalechamps, the Variorum,\r\nand those of De Laet and Sillig, the sentence concludes with the\r\nwords “nomen ex auro custodiens;” while in those of Valpy, Lemaire,\r\nPoinsinet, Ajasson, and others, we find substituted for them the words.\r\n“Non natura,” “Nomen natura,” “Nomine natura,” or “Nomen naturam.”—B.\r\nThe first reading is warranted by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[657] “Auri sanies.” More properly speaking, “the corrupt matter\r\ndischarged by gold.” See Chapter 26.\r\n\r\n[658] “Minium” is treated of in Chapter 36 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[659] “Pretia rerum.” The value of the raw material.\r\n\r\n[660] Pliny here refers both to the art of producing figures in relief\r\non drinking vessels made of the precious metals, and also of giving\r\nthem particular forms. A well-known line of Juvenal, Sat. ii. l. 96,\r\naffords a striking illustration of the depraved taste which existed in\r\nhis time.—B. Lampridius also speaks of vessels of silver “defiled with\r\nrepresentations of a most libidinous character;” and Capitolinus speaks\r\nof “phallovitroboli,” glass drinking vessels shaped like a phallus.\r\n\r\n[661] “Murrhina” or “myrrhina.” are described in B. xxxvii. c. 8;\r\nthey were, perhaps, onyxes or opals, though possibly the term was not\r\nstrictly confined to these substances, but signified any transparent\r\nminerals, that exhibited a variety of colours. Salmasius, however,\r\nridicules the idea of their being onyxes, and is of opinion that these\r\nvessels were made of porcelain; Exer. Plin. p. 144.—B.\r\n\r\n[662] See B. xxxvii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[663] He alludes to the cups known as “chrysendeta,” adorned with\r\ncirclets of gold, exquisite chasings, and groups of precious stones.\r\nSee Juvenal, Sat. v. l. 42.\r\n\r\n[664] The “Smaragdus” is described in B. xxxvii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[665] “Et aurum jam accessio est.”\r\n\r\n[666] “Sacrum famæ.” This is the reading given by the Bamberg MS. in\r\nsubstitution for “aurum, sacra fames” and other readings of a similar\r\nnature, in which Pliny was thought by the commentators to allude to the\r\nfamous lines of Virgil—\r\n\r\n  “Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, Auri sacra fames!”\r\n\r\nHad he alluded to the passage of Virgil, it is not probable that he\r\nwould have used the expression in the plural, “celeberrimi auctores.”\r\n\r\n[667] Il. B. vii. ll. 472-5.—B.\r\n\r\n[668] Il. B. vi. l. 236.\r\n\r\n[669] We may infer that this was the reason why the figure of an ox or\r\nother animal was impressed on the earliest Roman coins.—B.\r\n\r\n[670] As Hardouin remarks, “This story is told by others, of Gyges,\r\nand not of Midas.” He refers to Cicero, De Off. B. iii. c. 9, in\r\nconfirmation of his assertion.—B. Both Gyges and Midas were noted for\r\ntheir wealth.\r\n\r\n[671] “Sinistræ.” The play here upon the word “sinister” cannot be so\r\nwell transferred into the English language; but it bears reference to\r\nthe double meaning of the word, “on the left hand,” and “unlucky,”\r\n“ill-omened,” or, as we say “sinister.” We may remark, that rings were\r\nvery generally employed by the Romans, not merely as ornaments, but as\r\nindications of office and rank.—B.\r\n\r\n[672] From Corinth, it was said: Damaratus of Corinth being the father\r\nof the first Tarquin. See B. xxxv. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[673] On the subject of “Bullæ,” golden balls, worn by the children of\r\nthe nobles, see Dr. Smith’s Dict. Antiq. p. 168.—B.\r\n\r\n[674] As to the “Toga prætexta,” see B. viii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[675] “Lorum.” This word literally signifies a leather strap or thong,\r\nand Pliny is supposed by Hardouin to mean simply, that, in this latter\r\ncase the strap was worn without the bulla, which was in other cases\r\nattached to it. Juvenal, Sat. v. l. 164, speaks of the “lorum” of the\r\nchildren of the poor.—B.\r\n\r\n[676] Δακτύλιον, from δάκτυλος, a “finger.”\r\n\r\n[677] Festus says that this was the Oscan name for a ring. It would\r\nappear to be allied to the word “unguis,” which means a nail of the\r\nfinger or toe, and would perhaps signify a “nail ornament.”\r\n\r\n[678] As meaning a seal or signet, for which purpose, as we shall find\r\nexplained in the sequel, the ring was used.\r\n\r\n[679] This seems to be the meaning of “Vulgoque sic triumphabant.”\r\n\r\n[680] As to these crowns, see B. xxi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[681] As to some other particulars connected with this usage, see the\r\nend of B. xxviii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[682] And yet, as Hardouin remarks, before his time, when Scipio was\r\nbesieging Carthage, the bodies of the Roman tribunes, when selected for\r\nburial by Hasdrubal, were distinguished by their rings of gold. The\r\nobject of Marius, no doubt, was to ingratiate himself with the upper\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n[683] A.U.C. 651.\r\n\r\n[684] Known as the “anulus pronubus,” or “engaged ring,” according to\r\nDalechamps.\r\n\r\n[685] “Codicillos.” Il. B. vi. l. 168.\r\n\r\n[686] See B. xiii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[687] Od. B. viii. ll. 424, 443, 447.\r\n\r\n[688] See the Iliad, B. iii. and B. vii. l. 175, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[689] His meaning is, that although κληρὸι were used, lots or\r\nballs made of earth, we do not read that the impressions on them were\r\nmade by the aid of signet-rings.\r\n\r\n[690] “Fabricæ deûm.” He alludes to the forge of Vulcan, described in\r\nthe Eighteenth Book of the Iliad, l. 400, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[691] This seems to be the meaning of “In primordio factitâsse.”\r\n\r\n[692] The “fibulæ” were the brooches of the ancients, consisting of a\r\npin, and of a curved portion furnished with a hook. See Dr. Smith’s\r\nDict. Antiq. p. 417.\r\n\r\n[693] As the meaning of this passage has been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion with commentators, we give it in full, as found in the\r\nEdition of Sillig. “Et quisquis primus instituit, cunctanter id fecit,\r\nlævis manibus latentibusque induit, cum, si honos securus fuisset,\r\ndextrâ fuerit ostentandus. Quodsi impedimentum potuit in eo aliquod\r\nintelligi, etiam serior is usus argumentum est, et majus in lævâ\r\nfuisset, quâ scutum capitur.” Sillig is of opinion that Pliny is here\r\nalluding to the reason given by Ateius Capito (quoted in Macrobius,\r\nSaturn. B. vii. c. 13), for wearing the ring on the left hand. It was\r\nso worn, he says, from an apprehension that the precious stone with\r\nwhich it was set, might receive injury from the continual use made of\r\nthe right hand.\r\n\r\n[694] Under the folds of the toga.\r\n\r\n[695] Il. B. xvii. l. 52.\r\n\r\n[696] The reading in most MSS. is the “fourth consulship.” This,\r\nhowever, is an error which has been rectified by the Bamberg and some\r\nother MSS. Pompey was but _thrice_ consul. M. Crassus was the person\r\ngenerally accused of the act of robbery here alluded to.\r\n\r\n[697] Who took the golden torc (torques) from the Gaul whom he slew;\r\nwhence his name.\r\n\r\n[698] “Cum auro pugnare solitos.”\r\n\r\n[699] “Quod equidem in augurio intellectum est, cum Capitolinus duplum\r\nreddidisset.” The meaning of this passage is obscure, and cannot\r\nwith certainty be ascertained. Holland renders it, “To the light\r\nand knowledge whereof we come by means of revelation from Augurie,\r\nwhich gave us to understand, that Jupiter Capitolinus had rendered\r\nagain the foresaid summe in duple proportion.” Littré gives a similar\r\ntranslation. Ajasson translates it, “This, at least, is what we may\r\npresume, from the fact of there being discovered double the amount\r\nexpected;” following the explanation given by Hardouin.\r\n\r\n[700] The “ædituus,” or “temple keeper.” See B. xxxvi. 4.\r\n\r\n[701] Beneath which there was poison concealed, Hardouin says. Hannibal\r\nkilled himself in a similar manner; also Demosthenes, as mentioned in\r\nthe next Chapter.\r\n\r\n[702] The adopted son of the great Marius. This event happened in his\r\nconsulship, B.C. 82. After his defeat by Sylla at Sacriportus, he\r\nretired into the fortified town of Præneste, where he had deposited\r\nthe treasures of the Capitoline temple. The temple, after this\r\nconflagration, was rebuilt by order of Sylla.\r\n\r\n[703] Called the “Fasti;” probably because this was the first word of\r\nthe title.\r\n\r\n[704] “Dies fasti.” These were the days on which the courts sat, and\r\nthe Prætor, who was the chief judge, gave his decisions. The word\r\n“fasti” is derived from the ancient Latin “for,” or from the old\r\nGreek word φάω, both signifying “to speak:” consequently the\r\n“dies fasti” were “the speaking days,” and the “dies nefasti” the\r\n“non-speaking days,” in allusion to the restrictions put upon the\r\njudgments of the Prætor.\r\n\r\n[705] This complex state of the Roman Calendar long remained one of\r\nthe sources from which the priesthood and the patrician order derived\r\ntheir power and influence over the plebeians. Having no other method of\r\nascertaining what days were “fasti,” and what were “nefasti,” the lower\r\nclasses were obliged either to apply to the priests and nobles for\r\ninformation, or to await the proclamation by the priests of the various\r\nfestivals about to take place.\r\n\r\n[706] Appius Claudius Cæcus, the Censor and jurisconsult, who\r\nconstructed the Appian Way.\r\n\r\n[707] A.U.C. 440, or B.C. 314.\r\n\r\n[708] In the war, probably, with the twelve nations of Etruria, who\r\nwere conquered by the Consul Fabius A.U.C. 444. See Livy, B. ix.\r\n\r\n[709] The father of the former C. Pœtilius Libo, was Consul A.U.C. 428:\r\nthe father of the latter, Cneius Domitius Calvinus, was Consul A.U.C.\r\n432.\r\n\r\n[710] “Anulos abjectos.”\r\n\r\n[711] The “phaleræ” were bosses of metal, often gold, attached to the\r\nharness of the horse. See B. vii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[712] He would probably imply hereby that, as he states subsequently,\r\nat this period gold rings were not as yet worn by _all_ the members of\r\nthe senate.\r\n\r\n[713] A.U.C. 449.\r\n\r\n[714] “Ædiculam æream”—of brass or bronze.\r\n\r\n[715] For the explanation of this term, see B. vii. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[716] See B. x. c. 2. Livy tells us that this shrine or temple was\r\nbuilt in the area or place of Vulcan.\r\n\r\n[717] Livy, B. xxiii. speaks of _one_ modius as being the real\r\nquantity. Florus, B. ii. c. 16, says _two_ modii: but Saint Augustin,\r\nDe Civit. Dei. B. iii. c. 19, and most other writers, mention _three_\r\nmodii.\r\n\r\n[718: Q. Servilius Cæpio. He and M. Livins Drusus had been most\r\nintimate friends, and each had married the other’s sister. The\r\nassassination of Drusus was supposed by some to have been committed at\r\nthe instigation of Cæpio. The latter lost his life in an ambush, B.C.\r\n90.\r\n\r\n[719: See B. xxviii. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[720: See B. ii. c. 85.\r\n\r\n[721: M. Calpurnius Flamma. See B. xxii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[722: A patrician family; branches of which were the Cincinnati, the\r\nCapitolini, the Crispini, and the Flaminini.\r\n\r\n[723: This is an erroneous assertion, both as to the East, and as to\r\nEgypt. See instances to the contrary in Genesis, c. xli. v. 42; and in\r\nEsther, c. iii. verses 10, 12, and c. viii. verses 2, 8, 10.\r\n\r\n[724: “Literis contenta solis.”\r\n\r\n[725: The Thirty-seventh Book. See also his remarks in B. ii. c. 63:\r\n“We tear out earth’s entrails in order to extract the gems with which\r\nwe may load our fingers. How many hands are worn down that one little\r\njoint may be ornamented!” Martial, Epigr. B. v. Ep. 11, speaks of\r\nhis friend Stella as wearing on the joint of one finger sardonyxes,\r\nemeralds, and jaspers.\r\n\r\n[726] “Violari.” See B. xxxvii. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[727] A fashion much followed at the present day.\r\n\r\n[728] This also is a not uncommon fashion at the present day.\r\n\r\n[729] From the “Trinummus” of Plautus, A. iv. s. 4, we learn that the\r\nring worn by slaves was called “condalium.” From the “Truculentus” of\r\nPlautus we learn also that these rings were sometimes made of bronze.\r\nThe “jus anuli,” or right of wearing a gold ring, was never conceded to\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n[730] See B. iv. c. 23. In the Origines of Isidorus Hispalensis, B.\r\nxix. c. 32, we find mention made of “A Samothracian gold ring, with\r\nan iron bezil, so called from the place of its invention.” Pliny has\r\nalready made allusion to the luxurious habits of the slaves, in B.\r\nxiii. c. 4; and B. xviii. c. 2; a subject upon which Juvenal enlarges\r\nin his Third Satire.\r\n\r\n[731] The reasons are mentioned by Ateius Capita, as quoted by\r\nMacrobius, Saturnal. B. vii. c. 13: also by Apion the Grammarian, as\r\nquoted by Aulus Gellius, B. x. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[732] The ring of each finger had its own appropriate name.\r\n\r\n[733] The “dactyliotheca,” or “ring-box.”\r\n\r\n[734] Juvenal, Sat. i. l. 26, _et seq._, speaks of the summer rings of\r\nthe Roman fops, and their fingers sweating beneath the weight.\r\n\r\n[735] Martial, Epigr. B. xiv., speaks of the numerous accidents to\r\nwhich a weighty ring was liable.\r\n\r\n[736] Hannibal, too, for instance, as mentioned in Note 701 to the\r\npreceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[737] He alludes, probably, to forgeries perpetrated through the agency\r\nof false signets.\r\n\r\n[738] Plautus, Cicero, Horace, and Martial, each in his own age, bears\r\ntestimony to the truth of this statement.\r\n\r\n[739] Or remembrancer; a slave whose duty it was to remind his master\r\nof the name of each member of his household; see B. xxix. c. 8.\r\nAthenæus, B. vi., speaks of as many as twenty thousand slaves belonging\r\nto one household. Demetrius, the freedman of Pompey, mentioned in B.\r\nxxxv. c. 58, had a retinue of slaves equal to an army in amount.\r\n\r\n[740] Meaning “Marci puer,” or “Luci puer”—“Marcius’ boy,” or “Lucius’\r\nboy.”\r\n\r\n[741] Suetonius says, c. 73, that Tiberius, in his last illness,\r\nawoke after a long lethargy, and demanded his signet-ring, which\r\nhis son-in-law, Caligula, had removed from his finger, under the\r\nsupposition that he was dead. Macro, to avoid any unpleasant results\r\nin the way of punishment, caused the emperor to be smothered with the\r\npillows and bedclothes.\r\n\r\n[742] This famous and somewhat improbable story of the ring of\r\nPolycrates is told by Valerius Maximus, B. vi. c. 9; Herodotus, B.\r\niii.; and Cicero, De Finibus, B. iv. Pliny again mentions it in B.\r\nxxxvii. cc. 2, 4.\r\n\r\n[743] He was crucified by Oroetes, the Persian satrap of Sardis.\r\n\r\n[744] “Anulo exsiliente.”\r\n\r\n[745] In Chapter 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[746] The laticlave tunic. See B. viii. c. 73, and B. ix. c. 63.\r\n\r\n[747] “Præcones.”\r\n\r\n[748] See the list of writers at the end of B. ix.\r\n\r\n[749] “Equus militaris.”\r\n\r\n[750] See B. xxix. c. 8. The “Decuriæ” of “judices,” or “judges,” were\r\nso called, probably, from ten (decem) having been originally chosen\r\nfrom each tribe. As to the Decuriæ of the judices, see Smith’s Dict.\r\nAntiq. pp. 531-2. The account given by Pliny is confused in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[751] “Turmæ.” Squadrons of thirty “equites” or horsemen; ten of which\r\nsquadrons were attached to each legion.\r\n\r\n[752] Before the time of Augustus, there were but _three_ decuries.\r\n\r\n[753] A law introduced by Aurelius Cotta, B.C. 70, enacted that the\r\nJudices should be chosen from the three classes—of Senators, Equites,\r\nand Tribuni ærarii, or Tribunes of the treasury, these last being\r\ntaken from the body of the people, and being persons possessed of some\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n[754] Members selected by lot.\r\n\r\n[755] “Nongenti.”\r\n\r\n[756] Tacitus says that this took place the year before, in the\r\nconsulship of C. Sulpicius, and D. Haterius. See the Annales, B. iii.\r\nc. 86.\r\n\r\n[757] Brother of the Emperor Galba.\r\n\r\n[758] “Aucupatus.”\r\n\r\n[759] Suetonius says that Tiberius instructed the ædiles to prohibit\r\nstews and eating-houses: from which we may conclude, Hardouin says,\r\nthat C. Sulpicius Galba was an ædile.\r\n\r\n[760] Or, in other words, belonging to the equestrian order. The Roman\r\nequites often followed the pursuits of bankers, and farmers of the\r\npublic revenues.\r\n\r\n[761] A law passed in the time of Julius Cæsar, B.C. 69, which\r\npermitted Roman equites, in case they or their parents had ever had a\r\nCensus equestris, to sit in the fourteen rows fixed by the Lex Roscia\r\nTheatralis.\r\n\r\n[762] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[763] Conjointly with L. Vitellius.\r\n\r\n[764] Or farmers of the public revenues; the “publicans” of Scripture.\r\nIn reality, they were mostly members of the equestrian order, and the\r\nwords “equites” and “publicani” are often used as synonymous.\r\n\r\n[765] “This passage seems to be the addition of some ignorant copyist.\r\nIt is indeed a remarkable fact, that we have _no_ inscription in\r\nwhich we see the Equites named _after_ the people as well as the\r\nSenate.”—Laboulaye, _Essai sur les lois Criminelles des Romains_:\r\nParis, 1845, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[766] According to Livy, B. i. c. 15, the Celeres were three hundred\r\nRoman knights whom Romulus established as a body-guard. Their name,\r\nprobably, was derived from the Greek κέλης, a “war-horse,”\r\nor “charger,” and the body consisted, no doubt, of the patricians in\r\ngeneral, or such of them as could keep horses. Another origin assigned\r\nto the appellation is “Celer,” the name of a chieftain, who was a\r\nfavourite of Romulus. The adjective “celer,” “swift,” owes its origin,\r\nprobably, to the title of these horsemen.\r\n\r\n[767] A title derived, possibly, as Delafosse suggests, “a flectendis\r\nhabenis,” from “managing the reins.”\r\n\r\n[768] Called “Trossum” or “Trossulum,” it is supposed. The remains of\r\na town are still to be seen at Trosso, two miles from Montefiascone in\r\nTuscany. The Greek word τρωξαλλὶς, a “cricket,” and the Latin\r\n“torosulus,” “muscular,” have been suggested as the origin of this\r\nname. Ajasson suggests the Latin verb “truso,” to “push on,” as its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n[769] See the end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[770] From the ambiguous nature of the name, it being in later times\r\nan expression of contempt, like our word “fop,” or “beau.” In this\r\nlatter sense, Salmasius derives it from the Greek τρυσσὸς,\r\n“effeminate.”\r\n\r\n[771] This concluding passage is omitted in most editions.\r\n\r\n[772] See B. vii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[773] Dionysius of Halicarnassus is therefore probably wrong in his\r\nassertion that torcs of _gold_ were given to Siccius Dentatus, a Roman\r\ncitizen, as the reward of valour.\r\n\r\n[774] See B. vii, c. 29.\r\n\r\n[775] On this subject, see B. xvi. c. 3, and B. xxi. c. i.\r\n\r\n[776] A.U.C. 323, or 431 B.C.\r\n\r\n[777] Situate about fourteen miles from Rome, and on the road to the\r\ntown called La Colonna.\r\n\r\n[778] A.U.C. 479, and B.C. 275. In the following year Merenda himself\r\nwas consul, with Manius Curius Dentatus.\r\n\r\n[779] “Testamento prælegavit.” Properly speaking, “prælegare” was “to\r\nbequeath a thing to be given before the inheritance was divided.” The\r\ncrown thus left by Piso was to be three pounds in weight.\r\n\r\n[780] Oxen, namely. The smaller victims had the head encircled with\r\nchaplets.\r\n\r\n[781] The clasps by which the “sagum” or military cloak was fastened on\r\nthe shoulders.\r\n\r\n[782] See the beginning of Chapter 4 of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[783] Isidorus Hispalensis, Orig. B. xix. c. 30, says that bracelets\r\nwere formerly so called from the circumstance of being conferred on\r\nwarriors as the reward of bravery—“ob virtutem.” Scævola, Ulpian, and\r\nothers speak of “viriolæ” as ornaments worn by females.\r\n\r\n[784] See B. xxxvii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[785] In allusion to the use of gold as an ornament for the shoes and\r\nsandal-ties.\r\n\r\n[786] A dress worn over the tunic, and which came as low as the ankles\r\nor feet. The stola was the characteristic dress of the Roman matrons of\r\nrank; other females being restricted to the use of the toga, which did\r\nnot reach so low.\r\n\r\n[787] Between the matrons of rank whose feet were not to be seen\r\nat all, and the plebeian females, whose feet _were_ seen, but\r\ncomparatively unadorned.\r\n\r\n[788] In the same way that the gold ring was the distinguishing mark of\r\nthe Equites, so would the gold ankle-jewels be the characteristic of\r\nthis new order of females. In the use of the word “Equestrem,” Ajasson\r\nabsolutely detects an indelicate allusion, and rallies our author on\r\nthus retaining “the aroma of the camp!”\r\n\r\n[789] “Pædagogiis.” The origin of our word “page.” The pages of the\r\nRomans were decorated with gold ankle-jewels and other ornaments for\r\nthe legs.\r\n\r\n[790] Or Horus, the god of silence. Ajasson is of opinion that this\r\nimpression on the seal was symbolical of the secrecy which ought to be\r\npreserved as to written communications.\r\n\r\n[791] To the Emperor’s presence.\r\n\r\n[792] The _first_ crime having been committed by him who introduced the\r\nuse of gold rings. See the beginning of c. 4 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[793] The golden denarius was known also as the “aureus” or “gold\r\ncoin.” It was worth 25 silver denarii. As to the modern value of the\r\nmoney used by the ancients, see the Introduction to Vol. III. The\r\ngolden denarius is mentioned also in B. xxxiv. c. 17, and in B. xxxvii.\r\nc. 3.\r\n\r\n[794] A.U.C. 479.\r\n\r\n[795] Meaning, literally, the “little pound,” in reference to the\r\ndiminished weight of the “as.”\r\n\r\n[796] Meaning “two pounds,” or in other words, “two asses.” See B.\r\nxxxiv. c. 2. As to the weight of the “libra,” or pound, see the\r\nIntroduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[797] “Brasse bullion, or in masse.”—_Holland._\r\n\r\n[798] “Money weighed out,” _i.e._ “expenses.”\r\n\r\n[799] “Money weighed out for the payment of interest.”\r\n\r\n[800] “To weigh out money for payment,” _i.e._ “to pay.”\r\n\r\n[801] “A weight of money.”\r\n\r\n[802] “Weighers-out;” meaning “keepers of accounts,” or “paymasters.”\r\n\r\n[803] “Weighers-out” of the soldiers’ wages; _i.e._ “paymasters.”\r\n\r\n[804] From “pecus,” a sheep. See B. xviii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[805] “Pounds” or “asses.”\r\n\r\n[806] The third of an “as.”\r\n\r\n[807] The fourth of an “as.”\r\n\r\n[808] Or ounces; being one-fourth of the “as,” of one “libra” in\r\nweight. See Introduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[809] A.U.C. 663.\r\n\r\n[810] The same as the quinarius, one-half of the denarius. In B. xx. c.\r\n100, it is mentioned as a weight. See also the Introduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[811] As, originally, there were 288 “scripula,” or scruples, to the\r\n“libra” or pound, this would appear to give 5760 sestertii to the\r\npound of gold, and not 900 merely. Though this apparent discrepancy\r\nhas generally puzzled the commentators, the solution, as suggested by\r\nM. Parisot, in the Notes to Ajasson’s Translation, appears equally\r\nsimple and satisfactory. He suggests that in the “as,” or “libra,” of\r\n_two ounces_, there were 288 scruples. Now, the scruple remaining the\r\nsame, when the as or libra was reduced to one ounce, it would contain\r\nbut 144 of these scruples. Then, on making the as the sixteenth part\r\nof a denarius instead of the tenth, it would lose three-eighths of its\r\nvalue in scruples, or in other words, 54 scruples, thus making it worth\r\nbut 90 scruples. Then again, as above stated, by the Papirian Law, the\r\nweight or value of the libra or as was reduced one-half, making its\r\nvalue in scruples only 45; or, in other words, five thirty-seconds of\r\nits original value, when worth two unciæ or ounces. This number of\r\nscruples to the libra would give, at the rate of twenty sesterces to\r\nthe scruple of gold, exactly 900 sesterces to the libra of gold.\r\n\r\n[812] Or “aurei.”\r\n\r\n[813] “Fames auri.” Similar to the words of Virgil, “Auri sacra fames.”\r\n“The curst greed for gold.” See Note 666 to Chapter 3 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[814] Another version of this story was, that he extracted the brain,\r\nand inserted lead in its place.\r\n\r\n[815] See B. xiv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[816] In B.C. 88, M. Aquilius proceeded to Asia Minor as one of the\r\nconsular legati to prosecute the war against Mithridates. On being\r\ndefeated near Protomachium, he was delivered up to Mithridates by the\r\ninhabitants of Mytilene, and after being treated in the most barbarous\r\nmanner, was put to death by pouring molten gold down his throat.\r\n\r\n[817] “Insperso.” Sillig is of opinion that Pliny is here speaking\r\nof the work now known by Italian artists as _tausia_ or _lavoro all’\r\nagemina_.\r\n\r\n[818] Hardouin thinks that Pliny is here making allusion to the Greek\r\nword “chrysendeta,” vessels “encircled with gold.” It is frequently\r\nused in Martial’s works.\r\n\r\n[819] See B. xv. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[820] It is against such practices as these that Martial inveighs, B.\r\ni. Ep. 28, and B. ix. Ep. 12.\r\n\r\n[821] A slave only; and not by any of his brother patricians. Antony\r\nwas rendered infamous by his proscriptions.\r\n\r\n[822] Appian and Livy mention the fine as consisting of ten thousand\r\ntalents _in all_, or in other words, eight hundred thousand pounds of\r\nsilver (at eighty pounds to the talent). Sillig is therefore of opinion\r\nthat Pliny is in error here in inserting the word “annua.” The payment\r\nof the ten thousand talents, we learn from the same authorities, was\r\nspread over fifty years.\r\n\r\n[823] Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[824] “Folia.” Hardouin prefers the reading “solia,” meaning “thrones,”\r\nor “chairs of state,” probably.\r\n\r\n[825] Ajasson refuses to place credit in this statement.\r\n\r\n[826] This vase of Semiramis was her drinking bowl, in much the same\r\nsense that the great cannon at Dover was Queen Elizabeth’s “pocket\r\npistol.”\r\n\r\n[827] The country to which, in previous times, the Argonauts had sailed\r\nin quest of the Golden Fleece, or in other words in search of gold, in\r\nwhich those regions were probably very prolific.\r\n\r\n[828] See B. vi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[829] This story of the defeat of the great Ramses-Sesostris by a petty\r\nking of Colchis, would almost appear apocryphal. It is not improbable,\r\nhowever, that Sesostris, when on his Thracian expedition, may have\r\nreceived a repulse on penetrating further north, accustomed as his\r\ntroops must have been, to a warmer climate.\r\n\r\n[830] Of the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n[831] Covered, probably, with plates of silver.\r\n\r\n[832] “Pegma.” A scaffold with storeys, which were raised or depressed,\r\nto all appearance, spontaneously. Caligula is the emperor meant.\r\n\r\n[833] Another reading is “seven” pounds in weight, and “nine” pounds;\r\nwhich would appear to be more probable than seven _thousand_, and nine\r\n_thousand_, as given by the Bamberg MS. It is just possible, however,\r\nthat the latter may have been the united weights of _all_ the coronets\r\ncontributed by Spain and Gaul respectively, the word “inter” being an\r\ninterpolation.\r\n\r\n[834] See B. iv. c. 31, B. xi. c. 47, and B. xviii. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[835] Hence known as the “Golden Day,” according to Dion Cassius, B.\r\nlxiii.\r\n\r\n[836] For further particulars as to the Golden Palace, see B. xxxvi. c.\r\n24.\r\n\r\n[837] A.U.C. 597.\r\n\r\n[838] Or Marsic War. See B. ii. c. 85.\r\n\r\n[839] There is an error in this statement, probably, unless we\r\nunderstand by it the small libra or pound of two ounces, mentioned in\r\nc. 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[840] This remark is confirmatory of the incorrectness of the preceding\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n[841] The reading here is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[842] A.U.C. 612.\r\n\r\n[843] See B. xix. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[844] Chapter 57.\r\n\r\n[845] In fact, no colour at all.\r\n\r\n[846] In _this_ climate, the light of most of the stars has the\r\ncomplexion, not of gold, but of silver.\r\n\r\n[847] The topaz, for instance.\r\n\r\n[848] For ductility and malleability, both which terms may perhaps be\r\nincluded in the “facilitas” of Pliny, gold is unrivalled among the\r\nmetals. As to weight, it is heavier than lead, the specific gravity of\r\ngold being 19.258, and that of lead 11.352. Pliny is therefore wrong in\r\nboth of these assertions.\r\n\r\n[849] He forgets asbestus here, a substance which he has mentioned in\r\nB. xix. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[850] Chlorine, however, and nitro-muriatic acid corrode and dissolve\r\ngold, forming a chloride of gold, which is soluble in water. Ajasson\r\nremarks, that gold becomes volatilized by the heat of a burning-glass\r\nof three or four feet in diameter; and that when it acts as the\r\nconductor of a strong current of electricity, it becomes reduced to\r\ndust instantaneously, presenting a bright greenish light.\r\n\r\n[851] The gold thus tested was called “obrussum,” “obryzum,” or\r\n“obrizum,” from the Greek ὄβρυζον, meaning “pure gold.”\r\n\r\n[852] See B. xviii. c. 23, where he calls the chaff used for this\r\npurpose by the name of “acus.”\r\n\r\n[853] The present mode of assaying the precious metals, is by fusing\r\nthem upon a cupel with lead.\r\n\r\n[854] For which purpose, lead was used, no doubt, in drawing the lines\r\nin the MSS. of the ancients. See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 339.\r\n_Bohn’s Ed._\r\n\r\n[855] This is far surpassed at the present day, its malleability being\r\nsuch that it may be beaten into leaves not more than one two hundred\r\nand eighty thousandth of an inch in thickness, and its ductility\r\nadmitting of one grain being drawn out into five hundred feet of wire.\r\nFor further particulars as to the gold leaf of the ancients, and the\r\nart of gilding, as practised by them, see Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol.\r\nII. p. 391, _et seq._ _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[856] See B. xxxvi. c. 64.\r\n\r\n[857] He alludes to what are now known as _pepitas_, oval grains of\r\nriver-gold. “Striges” is the reading in the Bamberg MS., “strigiles” in\r\nthe former editions.\r\n\r\n[858] “Massa.” As we should say at the present day, “nuggets.”\r\n\r\n[859] “Ramentum.”\r\n\r\n[860] The contrary is now known to be the case; gold is sometimes,\r\nthough rarely, found in an oxidized state.\r\n\r\n[861] As to the solvents of gold, see Note 850 above. Stahl says that\r\nthree parts of sub-carbonate of potash, dissolved in water, and heated\r\nwith three parts of sulphur and one part of gold, will yield a complete\r\nsolution of the metal.\r\n\r\n[862] Aldrovandus relates, in his “Museum Metallicum,” that the grave\r\nof the Emperor Honorius was discovered at Rome about the year 1544,\r\nand that thirty-six pounds’ weight of gold were procured from the\r\nmouldering dress that covered the body. See, on the subject of gold\r\nthreads, Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 415. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[863] The “cloth of gold” of the present day, is made of threads of\r\nsilk or hair, wound round with silver wire flattened and gilded.\r\n\r\n[864] “Paludamento.”\r\n\r\n[865] See B. viii. c. 74. Beckmann is of opinion, from a passage\r\nof Silius Italicus, B. xiv. l. 661, that the cloth of Attalus was\r\nembroidered with the needle. See this subject fully discussed in his\r\nHist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 415. See also Dr. Yates’s “Textrinum Antiquorum,”\r\npp. 371, 464.\r\n\r\n[866] “Without entering into any research respecting the minerals\r\nemployed for this cement, called ‘leucophoron,’ one may readily\r\nconceive that it must have been a ferruginous ochre, or kind of\r\nbole, which is still used as a ground. Gilding of this kind must\r\nhave suffered from dampness, though many specimens of it are still\r\npreserved.”—Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 294. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[867] B. xxxv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[868] Literally, “fluid silver.” “The first name here seems to signify\r\nnative quicksilver, and the second that separated from the ore by an\r\nartificial process.” Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 72.\r\n\r\n[869] In Chapters 32 and 41 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[870] As to the identity of the “alumen” of Pliny, see B. xxxv. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[871] In the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[872] See B. xi. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[873] See B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[874] See B. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[875] Ajasson remarks, that the Castilians still call the surface earth\r\nof auriferous deposits by the name of _segullo_. He also doubts the\r\ncorrectness of Pliny’s assertion as to the produce of the mines of\r\nDalmatia.\r\n\r\n[876] See B. xxxiv. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[877] We learn from Ajasson that numerous pits or shafts are still to\r\nbe seen in Spain, from which the Romans extracted gold. At Riotento, he\r\nsays, there are several of them.\r\n\r\n[878] Both meaning “channel gold.”\r\n\r\n[879] “Marmoris glareæ.” Under this name, he no doubt means quartz and\r\nschist.\r\n\r\n[880] See B. xxxvii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[881] See B. xxxvi. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[882] “Channel-gold” or “trench-gold.”\r\n\r\n[883] Becoming volatilized, and attaching itself in crystals to the\r\nside of the chimney.\r\n\r\n[884] Or “sweat.” This “sweat” or “silver” would in reality be a\r\ngeneral name for all the minerals that were volatilized by the heat\r\nof the furnace; while under the name of “scoria ” would be comprised\r\npyrites, quartz, petrosilex, and other similar substances.\r\n\r\n[885] The cupel or crucible is still known in Spain by the name of\r\n_tasco_.\r\n\r\n[886] Who were said to have heaped one mountain on another in their war\r\nwith the gods.\r\n\r\n[887] Deep mines in Spain are still called _arrugia_, a term also used\r\nto signify gold beneath the surface. According to Grimm, _arruzi_ was\r\nthe ancient High German name for iron.\r\n\r\n[888] See B. xxiii. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[889] The breaking-machines, used for crushing the silex.\r\n\r\n[890] “Cædunt” is certainly a preferable reading to “cadunt,” though\r\nthe latter is given by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[891] A similar method of washing auriferous earth or sand in the\r\nmines, is still employed in some cases.\r\n\r\n[892] “The bringing of water into one channel.”\r\n\r\n[893] Or as Holland quaintly renders it, “Some flying spirit or winged\r\ndevill of the air.”\r\n\r\n[894] Magnesian carbonate of lime, or dolomite, Ajasson thinks.\r\n\r\n[895] From the Greek, ἀγωγὴ.\r\n\r\n[896] It does not appear to have been identified; and it can hardly be\r\nthe same as the Ulex Europæus of modern Natural History, our Furze or\r\nGorse.\r\n\r\n[897] That of sinking shafts, described already in this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[898] All these names, no doubt, are of Spanish origin, although\r\nSalmasius would assign them a Greek one.\r\n\r\n[899] In B. iii. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[900] See B. iii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[901] “Auripigmentum.” Yellow sulphuret of arsenic. See B. xxxiv. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[902] “Lapis specularis.” See B. xxxvi. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[903] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[904] It was accidently mixed with the ore of arsenic, no doubt,\r\nunless, indeed, the emperor was imposed upon.\r\n\r\n[905] This is almost, but not quite, universally the case.\r\n\r\n[906] In Spain. See B. iii. c. 4, B. iv. c. 34, and B. ix. c. 2. The\r\nlocality alluded to is now unknown.\r\n\r\n[907] A name also given by the ancients to amber. Artificial\r\n“electrum,” or gold alloyed with silver, was known in the most ancient\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[908] The gold found by sinking shafts. See Chapter 21.\r\n\r\n[909] See B. ix. c. 65.\r\n\r\n[910] Od. B. iv. l. 71.\r\n\r\n[911] Pliny no doubt has been imposed upon in this instance.\r\n\r\n[912] “Solid hammer-work,” in opposition to works in metal, cast and\r\nhollow within.\r\n\r\n[913] In B. v. c. 20, most probably. See also B. xvi. c. 64.\r\n\r\n[914] The worship of Anaïtis was probably a branch of the Indian\r\nworship of Nature. The Greek writers sometimes identify this goddess\r\nwith their Artemis and their Aphrodite.\r\n\r\n[915] Holland has strangely mistaken the meaning of the veteran’s\r\nreply; “Yea, sir, that it is; and that methinks you should know best,\r\nfor even now a leg of his you have at supper, and all _your_ wealth\r\nbesides is come unto _you_ by that saccage.” He then adds, by way of\r\nNote, “For Augustus Cæsar defeited Antonie, and was mightily enriched\r\nby the spoile of him.”\r\n\r\n[916] In Sicily. According to Valerius Maximus and other writers,\r\na statue of solid gold was erected by the whole of Greece, in the\r\ntemple at Delphi, in honour of Gorgias, who was distinguished for his\r\neloquence and literary attainments. The leading opinion of Gorgias was,\r\nthat nothing had any real existence.\r\n\r\n[917] The ninetieth Olympiad, about the year 420 B.C., is much more\r\nprobably the correct reading; as it was about the seventieth Olympiad,\r\nor somewhat later, that Gorgias was born.\r\n\r\n[918] See B. xxxiv. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[919] See B. xxix. c. 38. and B. xxxvi. cc. 37, 38.\r\n\r\n[920] Or gith. See B. xx. c. 71.\r\n\r\n[921] Similar to the notion still prevalent, that the application of\r\npure gold will remove styes on the eyelids.\r\n\r\n[922] It has been supposed by some, that the “Chrysocolla” of the\r\nancients, as well as the “Cæruleum,” mentioned in c. 57 of this Book,\r\nwere the produce of cobalt; but the more generally received opinion is\r\nthat “chrysocolla” (gold-solder) was green verditer, or mountain-green,\r\ncarbonate and hydrocarbonate of copper, green and blue, substances\r\nwhich are sometimes found in gold mines, but in copper mines more\r\nparticularly. It must not be confounded with the modern chrysocolla or\r\nBorax.\r\n\r\n[923] In Chapter 21 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[924] The “Reseda luteola,” Dyer’s weed, or Wild woad. See Beckmann’s\r\nHist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 478-481, where the identity of the Chrysocolla of\r\nthe ancients is discussed at considerable length.\r\n\r\n[925] As to the identity of this substance, see B. xxxv. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[926] These drugs have not been identified.\r\n\r\n[927] “Elutam.” Though this is the reading given by the Bamberg MS.,\r\n“luteam” seems preferable; a name owing, probably, to its being\r\ncoloured with the plant “lutum,” as mentioned at the end of this\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n[928] So called, probably, from being made up into little balls\r\nresembling the “orobus” or vetch.\r\n\r\n[929] A powder, probably, prepared from “cæruleum.” See the end of the\r\npresent Chapter, and Chapter 57 of this Book. Littré renders the words\r\n“in lomentum,” kept “in the form of powder,” without reference to the\r\npeculiar pigment known as “lomentum.”\r\n\r\n[930] “Sudore resolutis.”\r\n\r\n[931] A strong proof that chrysocolla was a preparation from copper,\r\nand not cobalt. Copper owes its name to the Isle of Cyprus, in which\r\nit was found in great abundance. See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p.\r\n480. _Bohn’s Edition_.\r\n\r\n[932] The colour now known by painters as Emerald green.\r\n\r\n[933] As a “trigarius.” See B. xxviii. c. 72, and B. xxix. c. 5. From\r\nSuetonius, c. 18, we learn that the Emperor Caligula, also, had the\r\nCircus sanded with minium and chrysocolla. Ajasson is of opinion that\r\nthe chrysocolla thus employed was a kind of yellow mica or talc.\r\n\r\n[934] “Arenosam.” He alludes, probably, to the kind previously\r\nmentioned as “aspera” or “rough chrysocolla.”\r\n\r\n[935] For its identification, see B. xxxiv. cc. 26, 32.\r\n\r\n[936] See B. xxxv. cc. 12, 18.\r\n\r\n[937] Making a spurious kind of “lomentum,” possibly, a pigment\r\nmentioned in c. 57 of this Book. This passage seems to throw some\r\nlight, upon the words “in lomentum,” commented upon in Note 929 above.\r\n\r\n[938] As to durability, probably.\r\n\r\n[939] It was the mineral, probably, in an unprepared state.\r\n\r\n[940] Gold-glue or gold-solder.\r\n\r\n[941] See B. xxxi. c. 46, as to the “nitrum” of Pliny. Galen, in\r\ndescribing the manufacture of “santerna,” omits the nitre as an\r\ningredient.\r\n\r\n[942] “Argentosum.” The “electrum,” probably, mentioned in c. 23.\r\n\r\n[943] As to the “cadmia” of Pliny, see B. xxxiv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[944] “Plumbum album.” Tin, most probably.

See B. xxxiv. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[946] See Chapter 19 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[947] “Thracius lapis.” This stone, which is mentioned also by\r\nNicander, Galen, Simplicius, and Dioscorides, has not been identified.\r\nHolland has the following Note on this passage] “Which some take for\r\npit-cole, or sea-cole rather, such as commeth from Newcastle by sea; or\r\nrather, a kind of jeat (jet).” In either case, he is probably wide of\r\nthe mark, neither coal nor jet igniting on the application of water.\r\n\r\n[948] Or mistletoe.\r\n\r\n[949] In due succession to gold.\r\n\r\n[950] See B. xxxiv. cc. 47, 53.\r\n\r\n[951] “Plumbum nigrum”—“Black lead,” literally] so called by the\r\nancients, in contradistinction to “plumbum album,” “white lead,” our\r\n“tin,” probably.\r\n\r\n[952] Lead ore; identified with “molybdæna” in B. xxxiv. c. 53. Native\r\nsulphurate of lead is now known as “galena.” See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv.\r\nVol. II. p. 211, where this passage is commented upon.\r\n\r\n[953] This Beckmann considers to be the same as the “galena” above\r\nmentioned; half-vitrified lead, the “glätte” of the Germans.\r\n\r\n[954] The specific gravity of lead is 11.352, and of silver only 10.474.\r\n\r\n[955] From the words μετ’ ἄλλα, “one after another.”\r\n\r\n[956] It is supposed that these shafts were in the neighbourhood of\r\nCastulo, now Cazlona, near Linares in Spain. It was at Castulo that\r\nHannibal married his rich wife Himilce; and in the hills north of\r\nLinares there are ancient silver mines still known its _Los Pozos de\r\nAnibal._\r\n\r\n[957] A mile and a half.\r\n\r\n[958] The proper reading here, as suggested by Sillig, is not\r\nimprobably “aquatini,” “water-carriers.” That, however, found in the\r\nMSS. is “Aquitani;” but those were a people, not of Spain, but of Gaul.\r\nHardouin suggests that “Accitani” may be the correct reading, a people\r\nof that name in Spain being mentioned in B. iii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[959] Meaning “raw” silver, apparently.\r\n\r\n[960] “Alumen.” See B. xxxv. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[961] Kircher speaks of this being still the case in his time.\r\n\r\n[962] See Chapter 19 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[963] “Vomica liquoris æterni.” Mercury or quicksilver becomes\r\nsolidified and assumes a crystalline texture at 40° below zero. It\r\nis found chiefly in the state of sulphuret, which is decomposed by\r\ndistillation with iron or lime. It is also found in a native state.\r\n\r\n[964] “Argentum vivum,” “living silver.”\r\n\r\n[965] Ajasson thinks that this is not to be understood literally, but\r\nthat Pliny’s meaning is, that mercury is a universal dissolvent.\r\n\r\n[966] “Permanans tabe dirâ.”\r\n\r\n[967] The specific gravity of mercury is 13.598, that of hammered gold\r\n19.361. Platinum is only a recent discovery.\r\n\r\n[968] “Id unum ad se trahit.”\r\n\r\n[969] “The first use of quicksilver is commonly reckoned a Spanish\r\ninvention, discovered about the middle of the sixteenth century; but it\r\nappears from Pliny, that the ancients were acquainted with amalgam and\r\nits use, not only for separating gold and silver from earthy particles,\r\nbut also for gilding.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv., Vol. I. p. 15. _Bohn’s\r\nEdition._\r\n\r\n[970] See the description of the mode of gilding, given in Chapter\r\n20 of this Book. Beckmann has the following remarks on the present\r\npassage: “That gold-leaf was affixed to metals by means of quicksilver,\r\nwith the assistance of heat, in the time of Pliny, we are told by\r\nhimself in more passages than one. The metal to be gilded was prepared\r\nby salts of every kind, and rubbed with pumice-stone in order to clean\r\nit thoroughly (see Chapter 20), and to render the surface a little\r\nrough. This process is similar to that used at present for gilding with\r\namalgam, by means of heat, especially as amalgamation was known to the\r\nancients. But, to speak the truth, Pliny says nothing of heating the\r\nmetal _after_ the gold is applied, or of evaporating the quicksilver,\r\nbut of drying the cleaned metal before the gold is laid on. Had he\r\nnot mentioned quicksilver, his gilding might have been considered\r\nas that with gold leaf by means of heat, _dorure en feuille à feu_,\r\nin which the gold is laid upon the metal after it has been cleaned\r\nand heated, and strongly rubbed with blood-stone, or polished steel.\r\nFelibien (_Principes de l’Architecture._ Paris, 1676, p. 280) was\r\nundoubtedly right when he regretted that the process of the ancients,\r\nthe excellence of which is proved by remains of antiquity, has been\r\nlost.”—Hist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 294, 295. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[971] Beckmann finds considerable difficulties in this description—“I\r\nacknowledge that this passage I do not fully comprehend. It seems\r\nto say that the quicksilver, when the gold was laid on too thin,\r\nappeared through it, but that this might be prevented by mixing with\r\nthe quicksilver the white of an egg. The quicksilver then remained\r\nunder the gold: a thing which is impossible. When the smallest drop\r\nof quicksilver falls upon gilding, it corrodes the noble metal, and\r\nproduces an empty spot. It is, therefore, incomprehensible to me how\r\nthis could be prevented by using the white of an egg. Did Pliny himself\r\ncompletely understand gilding? Perhaps he only meant to say that many\r\nartists gave out the cold-gilding, where the gold-leaf was laid on with\r\nthe white of an egg, as gilding by means of heat.”—Hist. Inv. Vol. II.\r\np. 295.\r\n\r\n[972] Chapter 42 of this Book. See also Chapter 20, in Note 868, to\r\nwhich it has been mentioned as artificial quicksilver.\r\n\r\n[973] He is speaking of Antimony.\r\n\r\n[974] From its whiteness.\r\n\r\n[975] Under the name of “female stimmi,” Ajasson thinks that pure, or\r\nnative, antimony is meant, more particularly the lamelliform variety,\r\nremarkable for its smoothness. He thinks it possible, also, that it\r\nmay have derived its Greek name “larbason,” or “larbasis,” from its\r\nbrittleness.\r\n\r\n[976] Ajasson thinks that under this name, crude antimony or sulphuret\r\nof antimony may have been included; as also sulphuret of lead,\r\nsulphuret of antimony and copper, and sulphuret of antimony and silver;\r\nthe last of which is often found covered with an opaque pellicle.\r\n\r\n[977] “Globis.” The fracture of sulphuret of antimony is, in reality,\r\nsmall subconchoïdal.\r\n\r\n[978] “Eye dilating.” Belladonna, a preparation from the Atropa\r\nbelladonna, is now used in medicine for this purpose. A similar effect\r\nis attributed in B. xxv. c. 92, to the plant Anagallis. In reality,\r\nthe application of prepared antimony would contract the eyelids, and\r\nso _appear_ to enlarge the eyes. This property is peculiar, Ajasson\r\nremarks, to sulphuret of antimony, and sulphuret of antimony and silver.\r\n\r\n[979] Preparations “for beautifying the eyebrows.” See B. xxi. c.\r\n73, B. xxiii. c. 51, and B. xxxv. c. 56. Omphale, the Lydian queen,\r\nwho captivated Hercules, is represented by the tragic poet Ion, as\r\nusing “stimmi” for the purposes of the toilet. It was probably with a\r\npreparation of antimony that Jezebel “painted her face, and tired her\r\nhead.” 2 Kings, ix. 30. The “Kohl” used by the females in Egypt and\r\nPersia is prepared from antimony.\r\n\r\n[980] “Spuma argenti.” See the next Chapter.\r\n\r\n[981] According to Dioscorides, it was prepared as a cosmetic by\r\nenclosing it in a lump of dough, and then burning it in the coals till\r\nreduced to a cinder. It was then extinguished with milk and wine, and\r\nagain placed upon coals, and blown till ignition.\r\n\r\n[982] As to the “nitrum” of the ancients, see B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[983] “Flos”—literally the “flower.”\r\n\r\n[984] “From this passage we may infer that the metal antimony was\r\noccasionally seen by the ancients, though not recognized by them as\r\ndistinct from lead.”—Dana’s System of Mineralogy, p. 418. New York,\r\n1850.\r\n\r\n[985] Pliny has here mistaken the sense of the word στέαρ,\r\nwhich in the passage of Dioscorides, B. v. c. 99, borrowed probably\r\nfrom the same source, evidently means _dough_, and not grease.\r\n\r\n[986] From ἕλκω, “to drag”—in consequence of its viscous\r\nconsistency, Hardouin says.\r\n\r\n[987] In B. xxxiv. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[988] Cerates, adipose or oleaginous plasters. See B. xxiii. c. 81.\r\n\r\n[989] “Spuma argenti.” This he uses as a general name for fused oxide\r\nof lead, the Litharge of commerce.\r\n\r\n[990] Ajasson thinks it possible that the “chrysitis,” or “golden”\r\nlitharge, may have been the yellow deutoxide of lead; the argyritis,\r\nor “silver” litharge, the white variety of the same deutoxide; and the\r\n“molybditis,” or “leaden” litharge, a general name for sulphuret of\r\nlead and silver; of lead and antimony; of lead, antimony, and bismuth;\r\nand of lead, antimony, and copper. Or perhaps, he thinks, they may\r\nhave been the respective names of yellow or golden litharge, white or\r\nsilver litharge, and terne. With the latter opinion Delafosse seems to\r\ncoincide.\r\n\r\n[991] “Tubulis.” These cakes were probably made in a tubular form.\r\n\r\n[992] “Vena;” meaning the ore probably in its raw state, and mixed with\r\nearth. All these distinctions are probably unfounded.\r\n\r\n[993] See B. xxxiv. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[994] Of “Puteolana.”\r\n\r\n[995] The litharge.\r\n\r\n[996] The scoria.\r\n\r\n[997] Nothing whatever is known as to the identity of these varieties\r\nof litharge. Indeed the words themselves are spelt in various ways in\r\nthe respective MSS.\r\n\r\n[998] In B. xxxiv. c. 53, where he identifies it with “galena,”\r\nmentioned in Chapter 31 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[999] See B. xviii. c. 13, B. xvi. c. 61, and B. xxii. c. 66.\r\n\r\n[1000] Sal gem, or common salt.\r\n\r\n[1001] In this Chapter. See note 987 above.\r\n\r\n[1002] The minium spoken of in this and the following Chapter is our\r\nCinnabar, a bisulphurate of mercury. This ore is the great source of\r\nthe mercury of commerce, from which it is obtained by sublimation. When\r\npure, it is the same as the manufactured vermilion of commerce.\r\n\r\n[1003] Intended, no doubt, to be typical of blood and carnage; and\r\nindicative of a very low state of civilization.\r\n\r\n[1004] See B. xxxv. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[1005] See B. v. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1006] See B. xvi. c. 12, and B. xxiv. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1007] The same as the miltos mentioned below, “miltos” being the word\r\nused by Homer, Il. II. 637. This substance is totally different from\r\nthe minium of the preceding Chapters, and from that mentioned in c.\r\n40. It is our red ochre, peroxide of iron, mixed in a greater or less\r\ndegree with argillaceous earth.\r\n\r\n[1008] See B. xxix. c. 8; where he speaks of the mistake made by the\r\nphysicians in giving mineral vermilion or minium to their patients\r\ninstead of Indian cinnabar. The latter substance is probably identical\r\nwith that which is now used for varnishes, being imported from India,\r\nand still known as “dragons’ blood,” the resin of the Ptero-carpus\r\ndraco, or Calamus palm.\r\n\r\n[1009] In B. viii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1010] In Chapter 41.\r\n\r\n[1011] The dragon’s blood, mentioned in the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1012] “Single colour paintings.” See B. xxxv. cc. 5, 11, 34, 36.\r\n\r\n[1013] Mentioned in Chapter 37.\r\n\r\n[1014] The “miltos” of the preceding Chapter. See Note 1007 above.\r\n\r\n[1015] In B. xxxv. c. 13, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1016] He is here speaking of our cinnabar, or vermilion, mentioned in\r\nChapter 36.\r\n\r\n[1017] See B. vi. cc. 27, 28, 32.\r\n\r\n[1018] See B. iii. c. 3, Vol. I. p. 163. He alludes to the district of\r\nAlmaden, in Andalusia, still famous for its quicksilver mines.\r\n\r\n[1019] When sold by the “publicani,” or farmers of the revenue.\r\n\r\n[1020] Of the publicani.\r\n\r\n[1021] Red oxide of lead, a much inferior pigment to cinnabar, or the\r\nminium of Chapter 36.\r\n\r\n[1022] In Chapter 32 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1023] Dana informs us that minium is usually associated with galena\r\nand with calamine. Syst. Mineral, p. 495.\r\n\r\n[1024] “Steriles.” Barren of silver, probably; though Hardouin thinks\r\nthat it means “barren of lead.” Holland renders it “barraine and void\r\nof the right vermilion.”\r\n\r\n[1025] In Chapter 37.\r\n\r\n[1026] B. xxxv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1027] When hired by the job for colouring walls or objects of art. See\r\nB. xxxv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1028] See B. xvi. c. 12, and B. xxiv. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1029] “Candelis.” The Abate Requeno thinks that these “candelæ” were\r\nused as a delicate cauterium, simply to keep the wax soft, that it\r\nmight receive a polish from the friction of the linen.\r\n\r\n[1030] Hence the use of it in the middle ages; a reminiscence of which\r\nstill exists in our word “rubric.”\r\n\r\n[1031] Or artificial quicksilver. In reality, hydrargyrus is prepared\r\nfrom the _genuine_ minium of Pliny, the cinnabar mentioned in Chapter\r\n36] it being obtained by the sublimation of sulphuret of mercury.\r\n\r\n[1032] In Chapters 20 and 32.\r\n\r\n[1033] This, probably, is the meaning of “lubrico humore compluere.”\r\n\r\n[1034] See the end of Chapter 38.\r\n\r\n[1035] Artificial quicksilver is still used for this purpose. See Note\r\n971 to Chapter 32 of this Book; also Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p.\r\n295. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1036] In Chapter 32. He alludes to the use of glair of eggs.\r\n\r\n[1037] Literally “whetstone.” He is speaking of the stone known to us\r\nas Touchstone, Lydian stone, or Basanite—“a velvet-black siliceous\r\nstone or flinty jasper, used on account of its hardness and black\r\ncolour for trying the purity of the precious metals. The colour left\r\non the stone after rubbing the metal across it, indicates to the\r\nexperienced eye the amount of the alloy.”—Dana, Syst. Mineral., p. 242.\r\n\r\n[1038] In Lydia. See B. v. cc. 30, 31.\r\n\r\n[1039] As a test. At the present day, concentrated nitric acid is\r\ndropped on the mark left by the metal; and the more readily the mark is\r\neffaced, the less pure is the metal.\r\n\r\n[1040] This seems to be the meaning of “si sudet protinus.”\r\n\r\n[1041] A very far-fetched explanation, and very wide of the mark.\r\n\r\n[1042] “Paulum propulsa.”\r\n\r\n[1043] Which he supposes a concave surface to do.\r\n\r\n[1044] This passage is noticed by Beckmann, in his account of Mirrors;\r\nVol. II. p. 58. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1045] Distorting the image reflected, by reason of the irregularities\r\nof the surface. See Seneca, Nat. Quæst. B. i. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[1046] “Parma Thræcidica.”\r\n\r\n[1047] He probably means, whether the surface is made convex or concave\r\nat these different angles.\r\n\r\n[1048] A subject to which he returns in various parts of B. xxxvi.\r\n\r\n[1049] See B. xxxiv. c. 48.\r\n\r\n[1050] As to the identification of “stannum,” on which there have been\r\ngreat differences of opinion, see B. xxxiv. cc. 47, 48, and the Notes.\r\n\r\n[1051] For some account of this artist, see Chapter 55 and the Notes at\r\nthe end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1052] “Silver mirrors were known long before this period, as is\r\nproved by a passage in the Mostellaria of Plautus, A. 1, S. 3, l. 101,\r\nwhere they are distinctly mentioned. To reconcile this contradiction,\r\nMeursius remarks that Pliny speaks only of his countrymen, and not of\r\nthe Greeks, who had such articles much earlier, though the scene in\r\nPlautus is at Athens.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 62. _Bohn’s\r\nEdition._\r\n\r\n[1053] “Nuper credi cœptum certiorem imaginem reddi auro opposito\r\naversis.”—“Of what Pliny says here I can give no explanation. Hardouin\r\n(qy. if not Dalechamps?) is of opinion that mirrors, according to the\r\nnewest invention, at that period were covered behind with a plate of\r\ngold, as our mirrors are with an amalgam. But as the ancient plates of\r\nsilver were not transparent, how could the gold at the back of them\r\nproduce any effect in regard to the image? May not the meaning be that\r\na thin plate of gold was placed at some distance before the mirror,\r\nin order to throw more light upon its surface? Whatever may have been\r\nthe case, Pliny himself seems not to have had much confidence in the\r\ninvention.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 62.\r\n\r\n[1054] Dr. Watson (Chemical Essays, Vol. IV. p. 246) seems to think\r\nthat Pliny is here speaking of _glass_ mirrors: “If we admit that Pliny\r\nwas acquainted with glass mirrors, we may thus understand what he says\r\nrespecting an invention which was then new, of applying gold behind a\r\nmirror. Instead of an amalgam of tin, some one had proposed to cover\r\nthe back of the mirror with an amalgam of gold, with which the ancients\r\nwere certainly acquainted, and which they employed in gilding.” See\r\nChapter 20 of the present Book. On the above passage by Dr. Watson,\r\nBeckmann has the following remarks: “This conjecture appears, at any\r\nrate, to be ingenious; but when I read the passage again, without\r\nprejudice, I can hardly believe that Pliny alludes to a plate of glass\r\nin a place where he speaks only of metallic mirrors; and the overlaying\r\nwith amalgam requires too much art to allow me to ascribe it to such a\r\nperiod without sufficient proof. I consider it more probable, that some\r\nperson had tried, by means of a polished plate of gold, to collect the\r\nrays of light, and to throw them either on the mirror or the object, in\r\norder to render the image brighter.”—Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 72.\r\n\r\n[1055] The dog-headed divinity. The seat of his worship was at\r\nCynopolis, mentioned in B. v. c. 11. Under the Empire his worship\r\nbecame widely spread both in Greece and at Rome.\r\n\r\n[1056] Under the word “pingit,” he probably includes the art of\r\nenamelling silver.\r\n\r\n[1057] “Fulgoris excæcati.”\r\n\r\n[1058] “Chaplet” copper.\r\n\r\n[1059] He either alludes to the practice of clipping the coin, or else\r\nto the issue of forged silver denarii, short of weight.\r\n\r\n[1060] During the prætorship of Marius Gratidianus. He was on terms\r\nof great intimacy with Cicero, and was murdered by Catiline in a most\r\nbarbarous manner during the proscriptions of Sylla.\r\n\r\n[1061] By public enactment probably; samples of the false denarius\r\nbeing sold for the purpose of showing the difference between it and the\r\ngenuine coin.\r\n\r\n[1062] Twenty times one hundred thousand, &c.\r\n\r\n[1063] As signifying a “debt owing to another.”\r\n\r\n[1064] “The Rich.”\r\n\r\n[1065] This seems the best translation for “decoxisse creditoribus\r\nsuis,” which literally means that he “boiled” or “melted away” his\r\nfortune from his creditors. In this remark Pliny is more witty than\r\nusual.\r\n\r\n[1066] The Triumvir. The first person mentioned in Roman history as\r\nhaving the cognomen “Dives,” is P. Licinius Crassus, the personage\r\nmentioned in B. xxi. c. 4. As he attained the highest honours of the\r\nstate, and died universally respected, he cannot be the person so\r\nopprobriously spoken of by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1067] The meaning appears to be doubtful here, as it is not clear\r\nwhether “sesterces,” or “sestertia,” “thousands of sesterces,” is meant.\r\n\r\n[1068] Who cut off his head after his death, and poured molten gold\r\ndown his throat.\r\n\r\n[1069] Originally the slave of Antonia, the mother of Claudius.\r\nAgrippina, the wife of Claudius, admitted him to her embraces, and in\r\nconjunction with her he for some time ruled the destinies of the Roman\r\nEmpire. He was poisoned by order of Nero, A.D. 63.\r\n\r\n[1070] C. Julius Callistus, the freedman of Caligula, in whose\r\nassassination he was an accomplice. The physician Scribonius Largus\r\ndedicated his work to Callistus.\r\n\r\n[1071] A freedman of the Emperor Claudius, whose epistolary\r\ncorrespondence he superintended. He was put to death on the accession\r\nof Nero, A.D. 54.\r\n\r\n[1072] In which case it would be dangerous to speak of them.\r\n\r\n[1073] A.U.C. 746.\r\n\r\n[1074] According to some authorities, he was a Lydian. He derived his\r\nwealth from his gold mines in the neighbourhood of Celænæ in Phrygia,\r\nand would appear, in spite of Pliny’s reservation, to have been little\r\nless than a king. His five sons accompanied Xerxes; but Pythius,\r\nalarmed by an eclipse of the sun, begged that the eldest might be left\r\nbehind. Upon this, Xerxes had the youth put to death, and his body cut\r\nin two, the army being ordered to march between the portions, which\r\nwere placed on either side of the road. His other sons were all slain\r\nin battle, and Pythius passed the rest of his life in solitude.\r\n\r\n[1075] “Stipem spargere.”\r\n\r\n[1076] A.U.C. 568.\r\n\r\n[1077] In performance of a vow made in the war with King Antiochus. See\r\nLivy, B. xxxix.\r\n\r\n[1078] So called from the silversmiths who respectively introduced\r\nthem. The Gratian plate is mentioned by Martial, B. iv. Epigr. 39.\r\n\r\n[1079] “Etenim tabernas mensis adoptamus.”\r\n\r\n[1080] “Anaglypta.” Plate chased in relief. It is mentioned in the\r\nEpigram of Martial above referred to.\r\n\r\n[1081] “Asperitatemque exciso circa liniarum picturas,”—a passage, the\r\nobscurity of which, as Littré remarks, seems to set translation at\r\ndefiance.\r\n\r\n[1082] He alludes, probably to tiers of shelves on the beaufets or\r\nsideboards—“repositoria”—similar to those used for the display of plate\r\nin the middle ages. Petronius Arbiter speaks of a round “repositorium,”\r\nwhich seems to have borne a considerable resemblance to our “dumb\r\nwaiters.” The “repositoria” here alluded to by Pliny were probably made\r\nof silver.\r\n\r\n[1083] “Interradimus.”\r\n\r\n[1084] “Carrucæ.” The “carruca” was a carriage, the name of which only\r\noccurs under the emperors, the present being the first mention of it.\r\nIt had four wheels and was used in travelling, like the “carpentum.”\r\nMartial, B. iii. Epig. 47, uses the word as synonymous with “rheda.”\r\nAlexander Severus allowed the senators to have them plated with silver.\r\nThe name is of Celtic origin, and is the basis of the mediæval word\r\n“carucate,” and the French _carrosse_.\r\n\r\n[1085] So called from his victory over the Allobroges.\r\n\r\n[1086] In allusion to the case of P. Cornelius Rufinus, the consul, who\r\nwas denounced in the senate by the censors C. Fabricius Luscinus and Q.\r\nÆmilius Rufus, for being in possession of a certain quantity of silver\r\nplate. This story is also referred to in B. xviii. c. 8, where _ten_\r\npounds is the quantity mentioned.\r\n\r\n[1087] This is said ironically.\r\n\r\n[1088] Sextus Ælius Pœtus Catus, Consul B.C. 198.\r\n\r\n[1089] “Prandentem.”\r\n\r\n[1090] L. Paulus Æmilius.\r\n\r\n[1091] It being lent from house to house. This, no doubt, was said\r\nironically, and as a sneer at their poverty.\r\n\r\n[1092] Now Arles. It was made a military colony in the time of\r\nAugustus. See B. iii. c. 5, and B. x. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1093] “Pellitum.” There has been considerable doubt as to the meaning\r\nof this, but it is most probable that the “privilege of the fur,” or\r\nin other words, a license to be clad in certain kinds of fur, was\r\nconferred on certain men of rank in the provinces. Holland considers\r\nit to be the old participle of “pello,” and translates the passage\r\n“banished out of the country and nation where his father was born.”\r\n\r\n[1094] “Triclinia.” The couches on which they reclined when at table.\r\n\r\n[1095] See B. ix. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[1096] This pattern, whatever it may have been, is also spoken of by\r\nCicero, pro Murenâ, and by Valerius Maximus, B. vii. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[1097] “Lances.”\r\n\r\n[1098] “Dispensator.”\r\n\r\n[1099] “Conservi”—said in keen irony.\r\n\r\n[1100] Giants, at least, one would think.\r\n\r\n[1101] Over the party of Marius.\r\n\r\n[1102] See B. ix. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[1103] “Compacta;” probably meaning inlaid like Mosaic.\r\n\r\n[1104] See B. xiii. c. 29, B. xv. c. 7, and B. xvi. cc. 26, 27, 84.\r\n\r\n[1105] Meaning, “drum sideboards,” or “tambour sideboards,” their\r\nshape, probably, being like that of our dumb waiters.\r\n\r\n[1106] The name given to which was “lanx,” plural “lances.”\r\n\r\n[1107] His age and country are uncertain. We learn, however, from\r\nChapter 55 of this Book, that he flourished before the burning of the\r\nTemple of Diana at Ephesus, B.C. 356. He is frequently mentioned in the\r\nclassical writers. See also B. vii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[1108] He includes, probably, under this name both Asia Minor and\r\nSyria. See a similar passage in Livy, B. xxxix.\r\n\r\n[1109] This passage is rejected by Sillig as a needless interpolation.\r\n\r\n[1110] Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[1111] King of Pergamus.\r\n\r\n[1112] Over King Antiochus.\r\n\r\n[1113] He alludes to the destruction of Corinth, by L. Mummius Achaïcus.\r\n\r\n[1114] A drinking cup with handles, sacred to Bacchus. See B. xxxiv. c.\r\n25.\r\n\r\n[1115] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[1116] In allusion to the plebeian origin of C. Marius, who was born\r\nat the village of Cereatæ, near Arpinum. It is more than probable that\r\nthe story that he had worked as a common peasant for wages, was an\r\ninvention of the faction of Sylla.\r\n\r\n[1117] “Ille arator Arpinas, et manipularis imperator.”\r\n\r\n[1118] Meaning the first king of that name. He was son of Mithridates\r\nIV., king of Pontus.\r\n\r\n[1119] Appian says that there “was a gold statue of this Mithridates,\r\nexhibited in the triumph of Pompey, eight cubits in height.” Plutarch\r\nspeaks of another statue of the same king, exhibited by Lucullus, six\r\nfeet in height.\r\n\r\n[1120] “Compedes.” See Chapter 12 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1121] The translation of this passage is somewhat doubtful. We will,\r\ntherefore, subjoin that of Holland, who adopts the other version. “As\r\nwe may see by our proud and sumptuous dames, that are but commoners and\r\nartizans’ wives, who are forced to make themselves carquans and such\r\nornaments for their shoes, of silver, because the rigour of the statute\r\nprovided in that case will not permit them to weare the same of gold.”\r\n\r\n[1122] A rhetorician who taught at Rome in the reign of Augustus. The\r\npoet Ovid was one of his pupils. His rival in teaching declamation was\r\nPorcius Latro.\r\n\r\n[1123] Of an improper intimacy with his pupils.\r\n\r\n[1124] Rings of silver being passed through the prepuce. This practice\r\nis described by Celsus, B. vii. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[1125] “Videret hinc dona fortium fieri, aut in hæc frangi.”\r\n\r\n[1126] In B. vii. c. 39, and in Chapter 53 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1127] “Quatuor paria ab eo omnino facta sunt.” Sillig, in his\r\n_Dictionary of Ancient Artists_, finds a difficulty in this passage.\r\n“The term ‘omnino’ seems to imply that the productions in question,\r\nall of which perished, were the _only_ works executed by this artist;\r\nbut we find several passages of ancient writers, in which vases, &c.\r\nengraved by Mentor, are mentioned as extant. Thus, then, we must\r\nconclude, either that the term ‘omnino’ should be understood in the\r\nsense of ‘chiefly,’ ‘pre-eminently,’ or that the individuals claiming\r\nto possess works of Mentor, were themselves misinformed, or endeavoured\r\nto deceive others.” If, however, we look at the word “paria” in a\r\nstrictly technical sense, the difficulty will probably be removed.\r\nPliny’s meaning seems to be that Mentor made four _pairs_, and no more,\r\nof some peculiar kind of vessel probably, and that all these pairs were\r\nnow lost. He does not say that Mentor did not make other works of art,\r\nin _single_ pieces. Thiersch, _Act. Acad. Monac._ v. p. 128, expresses\r\nan opinion that the word “omnino” is a corruption, and that in it lies\r\nconcealed the name of the kind of plate that is meant.\r\n\r\n[1128] See B. vii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[1129] His age and country are unknown.\r\n\r\n[1130] From Pausanias we learn that he was a statuary and engraver on\r\nplate, born at Carthage; but Raoul Rochette thinks that he was a native\r\nof Chalcedon. He is mentioned also by Cicero, In Verrem, 4. 14, and in\r\nthe Culex, l. 66, ascribed by some to Virgil.\r\n\r\n[1131] His country is uncertain. According to the statements of\r\nPausanias, B. i. c. 28, he must have been a contemporary of Phidias,\r\nabout Olymp. 84, B.C. 444. He is mentioned also by Propertius, Martial,\r\nand Statius.\r\n\r\n[1132] His birth-place is unknown, but he probably lived about the time\r\nof Phidias, and we learn from Pausanias that he was living when the\r\nplague ceased at Athens, in B.C. 429. He is mentioned also by Cicero,\r\nOvid, Quintilian, Lucian, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\r\n\r\n[1133] Nothing further is known of this artist.\r\n\r\n[1134] “Collocavisse verius quam cælasse.”\r\n\r\n[1135] “Phiala.”\r\n\r\n[1136] He lived probably about Olymp. 126; but his country is unknown.\r\nHe is mentioned by Athenæus. See also B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1137] Nothing whatever is known of him, unless indeed he is identical\r\nwith the Tauriscus mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[1138] Nothing is known of his age or country. He is also mentioned in\r\nB. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1139] His age and country are unknown. See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1140] Nothing further is known of him. See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1141] See the end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1142] Beyond the mention made of him in B. xxxiv. c. 19, no\r\nparticulars relative to him are known.\r\n\r\n[1143] Other readings of this name are “Lædus Stratiotes,” “Ledis\r\nThracides,” “Hieris Thracides,” and “Lidistratices.” The Bamberg\r\nMS. has “Hedys Trachides.” Salmasius, Hardouin, and Sillig propose\r\n“Leostratides,” and Thiersch “Lysistratides.”\r\n\r\n[1144] Nothing further is known of him.\r\n\r\n[1145] For the murder of his mother Clytæmnestra.\r\n\r\n[1146] Nothing is known of this artist.\r\n\r\n[1147] From Troy.\r\n\r\n[1148] “Coquos,” literally, “cooks.”\r\n\r\n[1149] “Cooks in miniature.”\r\n\r\n[1150] By the process of moulding, probably.\r\n\r\n[1151] “Crustarius.” Of this artist nothing further is known.\r\n\r\n[1152] Yellow or brown Ochre, probably. Ajasson thinks that under\r\nthis name may be included peroxide of iron, hydroxide of iron in a\r\nstalactitic and mamillary form, and compact peroxide of iron, imparting\r\na colour to argillaceous earth.\r\n\r\n[1153] “Scaly and ochrey brown iron ore are decomposed earthy\r\nvarieties, often soft like chalk; yellow ochre is here included.”—Dana,\r\nSyst. Mineral, p. 436.\r\n\r\n[1154] “Marmorosum.”\r\n\r\n[1155] “Lucidum.”\r\n\r\n[1156] “Abacos.” Small compartments or partitions in a square form on\r\nthe walls of rooms.\r\n\r\n[1157] See B. vii. c. 57, where he is called an Athenian, whereas he\r\nwas a native of Thasos. He was one of the most eminent painters of\r\nantiquity, and flourished in the age of Pericles. See a further account\r\nof him in B. xxxv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1158] Son of Phanochus, and contemporary of Polygnotus. See B. xxxv.\r\nc. 25, where it is stated that in conjunction with Polygnotus, he\r\neither invented some new colours, or employed them in his paintings on\r\na better plan than that previously adopted.\r\n\r\n[1159] “It is possible that the ‘cæruleum’ of the ancients may in\r\nsome cases have been real ultramarine, but properly and in general,\r\nit was only copper ochre.”—Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 472.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._ Delafosse identifies it with blue carbonate and\r\nhydrocarbonate of copper, one of the two azurites.\r\n\r\n[1160] “Candidiorem nigrioremve, et crassiorem tenuioremve.”\r\n\r\n[1161] Beckmann thinks that Pliny is here alluding to an artificial\r\nkind of “cæruleum.” “Pliny clearly adds to it an artificial colour,\r\nwhich in my opinion was made in the same manner as our lake; for he\r\nspeaks of an earth, which when boiled with plants, acquired their blue\r\ncolour.”—Hist. Inv., Vol. II. p. 480.\r\n\r\n[1162] Supposed by Hardouin to have been “glastum” or “woad,” the\r\nIsatis tinctoria of Linnæus, mentioned in B. xxii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1163] “In suâ coquitur herbâ.”\r\n\r\n[1164] A blue powder; see Chapter 27 of this Book. Beckmann has the\r\nfollowing remarks on this and the preceding lines: “The well-known\r\npassage of Pliny in which Lehmann thinks he can with certainty discover\r\ncobalt, is so singular a medley that nothing to be depended on can be\r\ngathered from it. The author, it is true, where he treats of mineral\r\npigments, seems to speak of a blue sand which produced different\r\nshades of blue paint, according as it was pounded coarser or finer.\r\nThe palest powder was called lomentum, and this Lehmann considers as\r\nour powder-blue. I am, however, fully convinced that the _cyanus_ of\r\nTheophrastus, the _cæruleum_ of Pliny, and the _chrysocolla_ (see\r\nChapter 26), were the blue copper earth already mentioned, which may\r\nhave been mixed and blended together.”—Hist. Inv. Vol. I. pp. 480, 481.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1165] According to Vitruvius, B. vii. c. 11, the manufactory of\r\nVestorius was at Puteoli, now Pozzuoli. This was probably the same C.\r\nVestorius who was also a money-lender and a friend of Atticus, and with\r\nwhom Cicero had monetary transactions. He is mentioned as “Vestorium\r\nmeum,” in the Epistles of Cicero to Atticus.\r\n\r\n[1166] For colouring surfaces of clay or cretaceous earth. This kind\r\nwas also manufactured by Vesturius, most probably.\r\n\r\n[1167] “Idem et Puteolani usus, præterque ad fenestras.” “The\r\nexpression here, _usus ad fenestras_, has been misapplied by Lehmann,\r\nas a strong proof of his assertion; for he explained it as if Pliny\r\nhad said that a blue pigment was used for painting window-frames; but\r\nglass windows were at that time unknown. I suspect that Pliny meant to\r\nsay only that one kind of paint could not be employed near openings\r\nwhich afforded a passage to the light, as it soon decayed and lost its\r\ncolour. This would have been the case in particular with _lake_, in\r\nwhich there was a mixture of vegetable particles.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv.\r\nVol. I. p. 480.\r\n\r\n[1168] “Indian” pigment. Probably our “indigo.” It is again mentioned,\r\nand at greater length, in B. xxxv. c. 27. See also Beckmann, Hist. Inv.\r\nVol. II. pp. 259, 267. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1169] This is probably a more correct reading than “seven.”\r\n\r\n[1170] See B. xxxv. c. 19. Vitruvius, B. vii. c. 14, describes an\r\nexactly similar method adopted by dyers for imitating the colour of\r\nAttic sil, or ochre, mentioned in Chapter 56.\r\n\r\n[1171] A quarter in the city of Capua, inhabited by druggists and\r\nperfumers; see B. xvi. c. 18, and B. xxxiv. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[1172] In some MSS. the reading here is “Domitius,” and in others the\r\nname is omitted altogether. We learn from the writings of Suetonius,\r\nthat the Emperor Domitian devoted himself to literary pursuits in\r\nhis younger days, and Quintilian and the younger Pliny speak of his\r\npoetical productions as equal to those of the greatest masters. Sillig\r\nexpresses an opinion that Pliny may possibly have borrowed something\r\nfrom his works, and inserted his name, with a view of pleasing the\r\nyoung prince and his father, the Emperor Vespasian.\r\n\r\n[1173] He is quoted in Chapter 9 of this Book, where it appears that\r\nhe took his cognomen on account of his friendship for C. Gracchus. He\r\nwrote a work, “De Potestatibus,” which gave an account of the Roman\r\nmagistrates from the time of the kings. A few fragments of this work,\r\nwhich was highly esteemed by the ancients, are all that remain.\r\n\r\n[1174] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1175] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1176] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1177] Valerius Messala Corvinus. See end of B. ix.\r\n\r\n[1178] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[1179] Calvus Licinius Macer was the son of C. Licinius Macer, a person\r\nof prætorian rank, who, on being impeached of extortion by Cicero,\r\ncommitted suicide. We learn from our author, B. xxxiv. c. 50, that\r\nin his youth he devoted himself to study with the greatest zeal, and\r\napplied himself with singular energy to intellectual pursuits. His\r\nconstitution, however, was early exhausted, and he died in his 35th or\r\n36th year, leaving behind him twenty-one orations. We learn from Cicero\r\nand Quintilian that his compositions were carefully moulded after the\r\nmodels of the Attic school, but were deficient in ease and freshness.\r\nAs a poet he was the author of many short pieces, equally remarkable\r\nfor their looseness and elegance. He wrote also some severe lampoons\r\non Pompey and Cæsar, and their respective partisans. Ovid and Horace,\r\nbesides several of the prose writers, make mention of him.\r\n\r\n[1180] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1181] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1182] Cornelius Bocchus.

If so, no further particulars are known of him.\r\n\r\n[1192] It seems impossible to say which of the physicians of this name\r\nis here alluded to.

The Xenocrates here mentioned\r\nis probably the same person that is spoken of in B. xxxv. c. 36, a\r\nstatuary of the school of Lysippus, and the pupil either of Tisicrates\r\nor of Euthycrates, who flourished about B.C. 260.\r\n\r\n[1203] There were two artists of this name, prior to the time of\r\nPliny; a sculptor, mentioned by him in B. xxxiv. c. 19, and a painter,\r\ncontemporary with Apelles, mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 36. It is\r\nimpossible to say which of them, if either, is here meant.\r\n\r\n[1204] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1205] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[1206] It is impossible to say which writer of this name is here meant.\r\nSee end of Books iv., viii., xi., and xx.\r\n\r\n[1207] A statuary, sculptor, and chaser in silver, who flourished at\r\nRome about B.C. 60. He was a native of Magna Græcia, in the south of\r\nItaly. He is not only mentioned in Chapter 55 of the present Book, but\r\nalso in B. xxxv. c. 45, as an artist of the highest distinction. His\r\nnarrow escape from a panther, while copying from nature, is mentioned\r\nin B. xxxvi. c. 4. His five Books on the most celebrated works of\r\nsculpture and chasing were looked upon as a high authority in art. He\r\nwas also the head of a school of artists.\r\n\r\n[1208] A writer on painting of this name is mentioned by Diogenes\r\nLaertius, B. vii. c. 12. He is probably the same as the person here\r\nmentioned, and identical with the Greek sculptor mentioned by Pliny in\r\nB. xxxiv. c. 19, who probably flourished about 240 B.C. The Toreutic\r\nArt, “Toreutice,” was the art of making raised work in silver or\r\nbronze, either by graving or casting: but the exact meaning of the word\r\nis somewhat uncertain.\r\n\r\n[1209] Menæchmus of Sicyon, probably; see end of B. iv., also B. xxxiv.\r\nc. 19.\r\n\r\n[1210] If he is really a different person from the Xenocrates mentioned\r\nabove, nothing is known of him.\r\n\r\n[1211] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[1212] Possibly one of the persons mentioned at the end of Books viii.,\r\nxix., and xxxi. If not, nothing whatever is known of him.\r\n\r\n[1213] An Athenian writer, surnamed “Periegetes.” The work here\r\nmentioned, is alluded to by other writers under different names. From\r\na passage in Athenæus, he is supposed to have lived after the time of\r\nAntiochus Epiphanes.\r\n\r\n[1214] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1215] The present Book is translated by the late Dr. Bostock, the\r\ntranslation being corrected by the readings of the Bamberg MS., which\r\ndo not appear to have come under his notice. Some Notes by Dr. Bostock\r\nwill be also found at the commencement of Books 33 and 35; they are\r\ndistinguished by the initial B.\r\n\r\n[1216] “Æris Metalla.” The word “Æs” does not entirely correspond to\r\nour word “brass;” the brass of the moderns being a compound of copper\r\nand zinc, while the “Æs” of the ancients was mostly composed of copper\r\nand tin, and therefore, would be more correctly designated by the word\r\n“bronze.” But this last term is now so generally appropriated to works\r\nof art, that it would seem preferable to employ in most cases the more\r\ngeneral terms “copper” or “brass.” For an excellent account of the “Æs”\r\nof the ancients, see Smith’s Dict. Antiq. “Æs.”—B. Mr. Westmacott, in\r\nthe above-mentioned article, says that the ancient “Æs” has been found,\r\nupon analysis, to contain no zinc, but in nearly every instance to be\r\na mixture of copper and tin, like our bronze. Beckmann says, on the\r\nother hand, that the mixture of zinc and copper now called “brass,”\r\nfirst discovered by ores, abundant in zinc, _was certainly known to\r\nthe ancients_. “In the course of time, an ore, _which must have been\r\ncalamine_, was added to copper while melting, to give it a yellow\r\ncolour.” Hist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 32, 33. _Bohn’s Edition._ There can\r\nbe little doubt that the native _Cadmia_ of Chapter 22 of this Book\r\nwas our Calamine, hydrosilicate of zinc, or carbonate of zinc, or else\r\ncopper ore impregnated with calamine.\r\n\r\n[1217] In B. xxxiii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[1218] “Stipis auctoritas.” The standard in money payments.\r\n\r\n[1219] These terms must have come into use when brass, “æs,” was the\r\nordinary medium, of circulation.—B. Their meaning is, “soldiers’ pay,”\r\n“tribunes of the treasury,” the “public treasury,” “made bondmen for\r\ndebt,” and “mulcted of their pay.”\r\n\r\n[1220] In B. xxxiii. c. 13.—B.\r\n\r\n[1221] “Collegium” The colleges of the priests and of the augurs being\r\nthe first two associated bodies.—B.\r\n\r\n[1222] In B. xxxiii. c. 31, where we have an account of the ores of\r\nsilver.—B.\r\n\r\n[1223] Pliny again refers to this mineral in the 22d Chapter. We\r\nhave no means of ascertaining, with certainty, what is the substance\r\nto which this name was applied by the ancients. The ores of copper\r\nare very numerous, and of various chemical constitutions] the most\r\nabundant, and those most commonly employed in the production of the\r\npure metal, are the sulphurets, more especially what is termed copper\r\npyrites, and the oxides. It has been supposed, by some commentators,\r\nthat the Cadmia of the ancients was Calamine, which is an ore of zinc;\r\nbut we may be confident that the _Æs_ of the ancients could not be\r\nproduced from this substance, because, as has been stated above, the\r\n_Æs_ contains no zinc. I must, however, observe that the contrary\r\nopinion is maintained by M. Delafosso.—B. See Note 1216 above.\r\n\r\n[1224] The inhabitants of Bergamum, the modern Bergamo.—B. See B. iii.\r\nc. 21.\r\n\r\n[1225] Aristotle gives the same account of the copper ore of Cyprus.\r\nChalcitis is also spoken of by Dioscorides, as an ore of copper.—B. See\r\nfurther as to “Chalcitis,” in Chapter 29 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1226] There has been much discussion respecting the nature of this\r\nsubstance, and the derivation of the word. Hardouin conceives it\r\nprobable that it was originally written “orichalcum,” _i.e._ “mountain\r\nbrass” or “copper.”—B. Ajasson considers it to be native brass,\r\na mixture of copper and zinc. In the later writers it signifies\r\nartificial brass. The exact composition of this metal is still unknown,\r\nbut there is little doubt that Hardouin is right in his supposition as\r\nto the origin of the name.\r\n\r\n[1227] Possibly so called from Sallustius Crispus, the historian, who\r\nwas one of the secretaries of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[1228] There is some doubt respecting the locality of these people;\r\nthey are enumerated by Pliny among the inhabitants of the mountainous\r\ndistricts of Savoy, B. iii. c. 24, and are referred to by Ptolemy.—B.\r\n\r\n[1229] Livia.\r\n\r\n[1230] It was named “Marian,” after the celebrated Marius, and\r\n“Corduban,” from the place whence it was procured; probably the\r\nmountains near Corduba, in Spain, well known as the birth-place of the\r\ntwo Senecas and of Lucan.—B. See B. iii. c. 3, and B. xix. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[1231] No light is thrown upon the nature either of Cadmia or\r\nAurichalcum by this statement; we only learn from it that different\r\ncompounds, or substances possessing different physical properties, went\r\nunder the common appellation of _Æs_, and were, each of them, employed\r\nin the formation of coins.—B.\r\n\r\n[1232] “Dupondiariis.” The “as,” it must be remembered, _originally_\r\nweighed one pound. See B. xxxiii. c. 13, and the Introduction to Vol.\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n[1233] He alludes to the _ancient_ works of art in this compound metal.\r\n\r\n[1234] The art of making compound metals.\r\n\r\n[1235] Vulcan, namely.\r\n\r\n[1236] No one has accidentally stumbled upon the art of making this\r\ncomposite metal.\r\n\r\n[1237] We have an account of the destruction of Corinth, and the\r\naccidental formation of this compound, in Florus, B. ii. c. 16.\r\nAlthough this account was generally received by the ancients, we may\r\nventure to assert, that it cannot be correct; we cannot conceive the\r\npossibility of such a fusion taking place during the destruction of the\r\ncity, or of the complete union of the components, in the mode in which\r\nthey have been found to exist.—B.\r\n\r\n[1238] B.C. 146.—B.\r\n\r\n[1239] “Trulleos.” In an epigram of Martial, B. ix. Ep. 97, the word\r\n“trulla” signifies a chamber-pot.\r\n\r\n[1240] From the Greek ἥπαρ, “the liver.”\r\n\r\n[1241] The Delian brass is mentioned by Cicero, in his oration “Pro\r\nRoscio Amerino,” s. 46, and in his Fourth oration “In Verrem,” s. 1.—B.\r\nPausanias, in his “Eliaca,” says that the Spanish copper, or copper of\r\nTartessus, was the first known.\r\n\r\n[1242] Or Cattle Market: in the Eighth Region of the City. See B. xxxv.\r\nc. 7, and Chapter 16 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1243] A distinguished statuary and engraver on silver. He lived in\r\nOlympiad 87. Further mention is made of him by Cicero, Ovid, Strabo,\r\nand Pausanias. See also Chapter 19 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1244] There were several artists of this name. The elder Polycletus, a\r\nnative either of Sicyon or of Argos, is probably the one here referred\r\nto. For further particulars of him, see Chapter 19.\r\n\r\n[1245] The words in the original are, respectively _candelabra_,\r\n_superficies_, and _scapi_.—B.\r\n\r\n[1246] Probably a proverbial expression at Rome, as it is employed by\r\nJuvenal, in an analogous manner, upon another occasion; Sat. iii. l.\r\n132.—B.\r\n\r\n[1247] Plutarch speaks of the Geganii as an ancient noble family at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\n[1248] See B. xxxiii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[1249] A.U.C. 585; we have an account of it in Livy, B. xiv. c. 42.—B.\r\n\r\n[1250] This building is referred to by Velleius Paterculus, in the\r\nbeginning of the Second Book of his History.—B. According to Aurelius\r\nVictor, it was situated in the Ninth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1251] The Temple of Vesta is described by Ovid, Fasti, B. vi. l. 265,\r\n_et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[1252] C. Camillus probably, the Roman jurist and friend of Cicero.\r\n\r\n[1253] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1254] “Triclinia,” “abaci,” and “monopodia;” these appear to have\r\nbeen couches for dining-tables, tables furnished with cupboards, and\r\ntables standing on a single foot. Livy, B. xxxix. c. 6, informs us,\r\nthat Cneius Manlius, in his triumphal procession, introduced into Rome\r\nvarious articles of Asiatic luxury; “Lectos æratos, vestem stragulam\r\npreciosam, monopodia, et abacos.” We are not to suppose that the whole\r\nof these articles were made of brass, but that certain parts of them\r\nwere formed of this metal, or else were ornamented with brass.—B.\r\n\r\n[1255] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1256] “Cortinas tripodum.” These articles of furniture consisted of a\r\ntable or slab, supported by three feet, which was employed, like our\r\nsideboards, for the display of plate, at the Roman entertainments.—B.\r\n\r\n[1257] “Lychnuchi pensiles;” this term is applied by Suetonius,\r\nJulius, s. 37; we may conceive that they were similar to the modern\r\nchandeliers.—B.\r\n\r\n[1258] This temple was dedicated by Augustus A.U.C. 726. The lamps in\r\nit, resembling trees laden with fruit, are mentioned by Victor in his\r\ndescription of the Tenth Quarter of the City.—B.\r\n\r\n[1259] See B. v. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[1260] We have an account of this event in Livy, B. ii. c. 41, in\r\nValerius Maximus, and in Dionysius of Halicarnassus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1261] “Iconicæ,” “portrait statues,” from εἴκων, of the same\r\nmeaning. This term is employed by Suetonius, in speaking of a statue of\r\nCaligula, c. 22.—B.\r\n\r\n[1262] Pisistratus. These statues are mentioned in the 19th Chapter of\r\nthis Book, as being the workmanship of Praxiteles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1263] See B. vii. cc. 31, 34: B. viii. c. 74: and B. ix. c. 63.\r\n\r\n[1264] Near the Temple of Janus, in the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1265] The Luperci were the priests of Pan, who, at the celebration of\r\ntheir games, called Lupercalia, were in the habit of running about the\r\nstreets of Rome, with no other covering than a goat’s skin tied about\r\nthe loins.—B.\r\n\r\n[1266] “Pænula.” See B. viii. c. 73.\r\n\r\n[1267] We are informed by Cicero, De Off. B. iii. c. 30, and by\r\nValerius Maximus, B. ii. c. 7, that Marcinus made a treaty with the\r\nNumantines, which the senate refused to ratify, and that he was, in\r\nconsequence, surrendered to the enemy. We may suppose that he regarded\r\nthe transaction as redounding more to the discredit of the senate than\r\nof himself.—B.\r\n\r\n[1268] See end of B. xviii.\r\n\r\n[1269] In the First Region of the City, near the Capenian Gate.\r\n\r\n[1270] “Celetes;” this appellation is derived from the Greek word\r\nκέλης, “swift,” and was applied to those who rode on\r\nhorseback, in opposition to the charioteers—B.\r\n\r\n[1271] Poinsinet remarks that Pliny has forgotten the gilded chariot,\r\nwith six horses, which Cneius Cornelius dedicated in the Capitol, two\r\nhundred years before Augustus; he also refers to an ancient inscription\r\nin Gruter, which mentions chariots of this description.—B.\r\n\r\n[1272] Mænius was consul with Furius Camillus, A.U.C. 416; we have an\r\naccount of his victories over the Latins and other neighbouring nations\r\nin Livy, B. viii. c. 14.—B.\r\n\r\n[1273] We have an account of this transaction in Livy, B. viii. c. 14.\r\nThis trophy is also mentioned by Florus, B. i. c. 11. The “Suggestus”\r\nwas an elevated place, formed for various purposes, the stage from\r\nwhich the orators addressed the people, the place from which the\r\ngeneral addressed his soldiers, and the seat occupied by the emperor at\r\nthe public games.—B.\r\n\r\n[1274] Florus, B. ii. c. 2, gives an account of the arrangements and\r\nequipment of the Carthaginian fleet, the victory of Duillius, and the\r\nrostral monument erected in its commemoration.—B.\r\n\r\n[1275] See B. xviii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1276] “Unciariâ stipe;” the _uncia_ was the twelfth part of the “as,”\r\nand the word _stips_ was regarded as equivalent to _as_, as being the\r\nusual pay of the soldiers.—B. See Introduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[1277] See B. xv. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[1278] This circumstance is mentioned by Cicero in his Defence of Milo,\r\n§ 90-1.—B.\r\n\r\n[1279] We have some account of Hermodorus in Cicero’s Tusc. Quæs. B. v.\r\nc. 36.—B.\r\n\r\n[1280] See B. x. c. 2, B. xviii. c. 3, and B. xxxiii. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[1281] Livy, B. ii. c. 10, and Valerius Maximus, B. iii. c. 2, give an\r\naccount of this event. A. Gellius incidentally mentions the statue, and\r\nits position in the Comitium, B. iv. c. 5.—B.\r\n\r\n[1282] We are informed by Dion Cassius, that there were eight statues\r\nin the Capitol, seven of which were of the kings, and the eighth of\r\nBrutus, who overthrew the kingly government; at a later period the\r\nstatue of Cæsar was placed by the side of that of Brutus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1283] Suetonius, speaking of this temple, remarks, that though\r\ndedicated to the brothers Castor and Pollux, it was, only known as the\r\nTemple of Castor.—B.\r\n\r\n[1284] We have an account of the victory of Tremulus over the Hernici,\r\nand of the statue erected in honour of him, in Livy, B. ix. c. 43.—B.\r\n\r\n[1285] This event is referred to by Cicero, Philipp. ix., 5.—B.\r\n\r\n[1286] Florus, B. ii. c. 5, gives an account of the murder of P. Junius\r\nand T. Coruncanius.—B.\r\n\r\n[1287] In the Bamberg MS. the reading is “unum se. verbum.” Gronovius\r\nis probably right in his conjecture that the word is “senatus consulti.”\r\n\r\n[1288] By one Leptines, at Laodicea.\r\n\r\n[1289] “Oculatissimo.” The place where there was “the most extended\r\neyeshot.” It is to this singular expression, probably, that Pliny\r\nalludes.\r\n\r\n[1290] “Quod campum Tiberinum gratificata esset ea populo.”\r\n\r\n[1291] A.U.C. 441.\r\n\r\n[1292] See B. vii. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1293] His life has been written by Diogenes Laertius, and he is\r\nmentioned by Cicero, de Fin. B. v. c. 19, and by Strabo.—B.\r\n\r\n[1294] In B. xxxiii. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[1295] We have an account of the exploit of Clælia in Livy, B. ii. c.\r\n13, and in Valerius Maximus, B. iii. c. 2: there is a reference to this\r\nstatue in Seneca, de Consol. c. 16.—B.\r\n\r\n[1296] To King Porsena.\r\n\r\n[1297] See end of B. xvi.\r\n\r\n[1298] Plutarch says that it was uncertain whether the statue was\r\nerected to Clælia or to Valeria.—B.\r\n\r\n[1299] A.U.C. 596.—B.\r\n\r\n[1300] See Chapter 9.\r\n\r\n[1301] “In Octaviæ operibus.” These were certain public buildings,\r\nerected in Rome by Augustus, and named by him after his sister Octavia;\r\nthey are mentioned by Suetonius.—B.\r\n\r\n[1302] Valerius Maximus refers to this event, but he names the\r\nindividual Statius Servilius, B. i. c. 8, § 6.—B.\r\n\r\n[1303] See B. xxxiii. cc. 50, 54.\r\n\r\n[1304] We have an account of the attack by Hannibal on Rome in the\r\ntwenty-sixth Book of Livy, but we have no mention of the particular\r\ncircumstance here referred to.—B.\r\n\r\n[1305] “Forum Boarium.” See Chapter 5.\r\n\r\n[1306] Livy, B. i. c. 19, informs us, that Numa made Janus of a form to\r\ndenote both peace and war.—B.\r\n\r\n[1307] The mode in which the fingers were placed, so as to serve the\r\npurpose here indicated, is supposed to have been by their forming the\r\nletters which were the Roman numerals for the figures in question. We\r\nare informed that some MSS. of Pliny give the number three hundred and\r\nfifty-five only, and there is reason to believe that, in the time of\r\nNuma, this was considered to be the actual number of days in the year.\r\nSome of the commentators, however, are disposed to read three hundred\r\nand sixty-five; and this opinion derives some support from Macrobius,\r\nwho refers to this statue as indicating this latter number with its\r\nfingers.—B. The Bamberg MS. gives three hundred and sixty-five.\r\n\r\n[1308] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1309] “Misoromæus”—“Roman-hater.” See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1310] Pliny himself informs us, in B. xxxv. c. 45, that the statue of\r\nJupiter in the Capitol, erected by Tarquinius Priscus, was formed of\r\nearth.—B.\r\n\r\n[1311] The art of moulding or modelling in argillaceous earth; see B.\r\nxxxv. cc. 43, 45.\r\n\r\n[1312] See B. xxxvi. c. 2, where he informs us that this theatre was\r\nhardly one month in use.—B.\r\n\r\n[1313] Hardouin gives several quotations illustrative of his liberality\r\nin bestowing ornaments in the City, and his inattention to his domestic\r\nconcerns.—B.\r\n\r\n[1314] The brothers Lucius and Marcus, the former of whom triumphed in\r\nthe Mithridatic, the latter in the Macedonian War.—B.\r\n\r\n[1315] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1316] See B. vii. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[1317] The absolute number of statues assigned to Lysippus differs\r\nconsiderably in the different editions, as is the case in almost every\r\ninstance where figures are concerned. Pliny gives a further account of\r\nhis works in the next two Chapters and in the following Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1318] “Aureum.” See B. xxxiii. c. 13, and B. xxxvii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[1319] In their attack upon Flavius Sabinus, the brother of Vespasian;\r\nA.U.C. 822.\r\n\r\n[1320] See B. iv. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[1321] It was a statue of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[1322] Better known by the name of Q. Fabius Maximus; he acquired the\r\nsoubriquet of Verrucosus from a large wart on the upper lip.—B.\r\n\r\n[1323] The Colossus of Rhodes was begun by Chares, but he committed\r\nsuicide, in consequence of having made some mistake in the estimate;\r\nthe work was completed by Laches, also an inhabitant of Lindos.—B.\r\n\r\n[1324] It remained on the spot where it was thrown down for nearly nine\r\nhundred years, until the year 653 A.D., when Moavia, khalif of the\r\nSaracens, after the capture of Rhodes, sold the materials; it is said\r\nthat it required nine hundred camels to remove the remains.—B.\r\n\r\n[1325] Demetrius Poliorcetes. See B. xxxv. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[1326] He is mentioned by Columella, in his Introduction to his work De\r\nRe Rusticâ, in connexion with the most celebrated Grecian artists.—B.\r\n\r\n[1327] Suetonius, in describing the temple which Augustus dedicated to\r\nApollo, on the Palatine Hill, speaks of the Portico with the Latin and\r\nGreek library.—B.\r\n\r\n[1328] This victory took place A.U.C. 461; we have an account of it in\r\nLivy, the concluding Chapter of the Tenth Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1329] This was a statue of Jupiter, placed on the Alban Mount, twelve\r\nmiles from Rome. At this place the various states of Latium exercised\r\ntheir religious rites in conjunction with the Romans; it was sometimes\r\ncalled Latialis.—B. See B. iii. c. 9, and Notes; Vol. I. p. 205.\r\n\r\n[1330] The designer of the Colossus at Rhodes.\r\n\r\n[1331] Decius is said by Hardouin to have been a statuary, but nothing\r\nis known respecting him or his works.—B. He probably lived about the\r\ntime of the Consul P. Cornelius Lentulus Spinther, A.U.C. 697.\r\n\r\n[1332] His country is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1333] See B. iv. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[1334] St. Jerome informs us, that Vespasian removed the head of Nero,\r\nand substituted that of the Sun with seven rays. Martial refers to it\r\nin the Second Epigram _De Spectaculis_, and also B. i. Ep. 71.—B.\r\n\r\n[1335] “Parvis admodum surculis.” There is, it appears, some difficulty\r\nin determining the application of the word _surculis_ to the subject in\r\nquestion, and we have no explanation of it by any of the commentators.\r\nCan it refer to the frame of wicker work which contained the model into\r\nwhich the melted metal was poured?—B.\r\n\r\n[1336] This observation has been supposed to imply, that Zenodotus\r\ncast his statues in a number of separate pieces, which were afterwards\r\nconnected together, and not, as was the case with the great Grecian\r\nartists, in one entire piece.—B.\r\n\r\n[1337] See B. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1338] The term _signum_, which is applied to the Corinthian figures,\r\nmay mean a medallion, or perhaps a seal-ring or brooch; we only\r\nknow that it must have been something small, which might be carried\r\nabout the person, or, at least, easily moved from place to place.—B.\r\n_Statuette_, probably.\r\n\r\n[1339] Her riddle, and its solution by Œdipus, are too well known to\r\nneed repetition here.\r\n\r\n[1340] In the following Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1341] Consul A.U.C. 787.\r\n\r\n[1342] The “Avenger.” In the Forum of Augustus, in the Eighth Region of\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\n[1343] “Regia.” The palace of Minerva, also in the Forum of Augustus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1344] See B. vii. c. 39, B. xxxv. c. 34, and B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1345] We have an account of this statue, and of the temple in which\r\nit was placed, by Pausanias, B. v. There is no work of Phidias now in\r\nexistence; the sculptures in the Parthenon were, however, executed by\r\nhis pupils and under his immediate directions, so that we may form some\r\njudgment of his genius and taste.—B. There is a foot in the British\r\nMuseum, said to be the work of Phidias.\r\n\r\n[1346] An Athenian; see B. xxxvi. c. 5. He is spoken of in high terms\r\nby Pausanias and Valerius Maximus.\r\n\r\n[1347] Tutor of Ptolichus of Corcyra, and highly distinguished for his\r\nstatues of the slayers of the tyrants at Athens. He is mentioned also\r\nby Lucian and Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1348] The reading is uncertain here, the old editions giving\r\n“Nestocles.” We shall _only_ devote a Note to such artists as are\r\nmentioned by other authors besides Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1349] An Athenian; mentioned also by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1350] There were probably two artists of this name; one an Argive,\r\ntutor of Phidias, and the other a Sicyonian, the person here referred\r\nto.\r\n\r\n[1351] A native of Ægina, mentioned by Pausanias. There is also a\r\nstatuary of Elis of the same name, mentioned by Pausanias, and to whom\r\nThiersch is of opinion reference is here made.\r\n\r\n[1352] See Chapter 5 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1353] An Argive, mentioned by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1354] See Chapter 5 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1355] Again mentioned by Pliny, as a native of Rhegium in Italy.\r\n\r\n[1356] A native of Paros, mentioned also by Pausanias and Strabo.\r\n\r\n[1357] Probably “Perillus,” the artist who made the brazen bull for\r\nPhalaris, the tyrant of Agrigentum. The old reading is “Parelius.”\r\n\r\n[1358] This and the following word probably mean one person—“Asopodorus\r\nthe Argive.”\r\n\r\n[1359] Perhaps the same person that is mentioned by Pausanias, B. vi.\r\nc. 20, as having improved the form of the starting-place at the Olympic\r\nGames.\r\n\r\n[1360] Mentioned by Pausanias as an Arcadian, and son of Clitor.\r\n\r\n[1361] A native of Clitorium in Arcadia, and mentioned also by\r\nPausanias.\r\n\r\n[1362] He is said by Pausanias and Athenæus to have been the son, also,\r\nof Myron.\r\n\r\n[1363] Son of Motho, and a native of Argos. He was brother and\r\ninstructor of the younger Polycletus, of Argos. He is mentioned also by\r\nPausanias and Tatian.\r\n\r\n[1364] He is once mentioned by Pausanias, and there is still extant the\r\nbasis of one of his works, with his name inscribed.\r\n\r\n[1365] It is supposed that there were two artists of this name, both\r\nnatives of Sicyon, the one grandson of the other. They are both named\r\nby Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1366] Probably a Sicyonian; he is mentioned also by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1367] As Pliny mentions two artists of this name, it is impossible to\r\nsay to which of them Pausanias refers as being an Athenian, in B. vi.\r\nc. 4.\r\n\r\n[1368] The elder artist of this name. He was an Athenian, and his\r\nsister was the wife of Phocion. He is also mentioned by Plutarch and\r\nPausanias.\r\n\r\n[1369] An Athenian; he is mentioned also by Vitruvius, Pausanias, and\r\nTatian. Winckelmann mentions an inscription relative to him, which,\r\nhowever, appears to be spurious.\r\n\r\n[1370] He is mentioned also by Pausanias, and is supposed by Sillig to\r\nhave been a Theban.\r\n\r\n[1371] Praxiteles held a high rank among the ancient sculptors, and may\r\nbe considered as second to Phidias alone; he is frequently mentioned by\r\nPausanias and various other classical writers. Pliny gives a further\r\naccount of the works of Praxiteles in the two following Books.—B.\r\n\r\n[1372] He was also an eminent painter, and is also mentioned by\r\nQuintilian, Dio Chrysostom, and Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[1373] Another reading is “Echion.”\r\n\r\n[1374] See B. xxxv. cc. 32, 36.\r\n\r\n[1375] This great artist, a native of Sicyon, has been already\r\nmentioned in B. vii. c. 39, and in the two preceding Chapters of the\r\npresent Book; he is again mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 39.—B. See note 1344\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[1376] Also a native of Sicyon. He is mentioned by Tatian.\r\n\r\n[1377] Mentioned also by Pausanias, Plutarch, Strabo, and Appian. The\r\nnext two names in former editions stand as one, “Euphronides.”\r\n\r\n[1378] Supposed to have been an architect, and builder of the Pharos\r\nnear Alexandria: see B. xxxvi. c. 18. The same person is mentioned also\r\nby Strabo, Lucian, and Suidas.\r\n\r\n[1379] An Athenian. He is mentioned also by Pausanias, Plutarch,\r\nDiogenes Laertius, and Tatian.\r\n\r\n[1380] See B. xxxv. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[1381] A Sicyonian, pupil of Lysippus. He is also mentioned by\r\nPausanias; see also B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1382] Son and pupil of Lysippus. He is mentioned also by Tatian, and\r\nby some writers as the instructor of Xenocrates.\r\n\r\n[1383] Sillig thinks that this is a mistake made by Pliny for\r\n“Daïppus,” a statuary mentioned by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1384] Son of Praxiteles, and mentioned by Tatian in conjunction with\r\nEuthycrates. The elder Cephisodotus has been already mentioned. See\r\nNote 1368.\r\n\r\n[1385] Another son of Praxiteles. He is also alluded to by Pausanias,\r\nthough not by name.\r\n\r\n[1386] His country is uncertain, but he was preceptor of Mygdon of\r\nSoli. See B. xxxv. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[1387] Mentioned also by Tatian; his country is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1388] It is doubtful whether Pausanias alludes, in B. vi. c. 4, to\r\nthis artist, or to the one of the same name mentioned under Olymp. 102.\r\nSee Note 1367.\r\n\r\n[1389] Sillig suggests that this word is an adjective, denoting the\r\ncountry of Polycles, in order to distinguish him from the elder\r\nPolycles.\r\n\r\n[1390] We learn from Pausanias that he worked in conjunction with\r\nTimarchides. The other artists here mentioned are quite unknown.\r\n\r\n[1391] Sillig, in his “Dictionary of Ancient Artists,” observes that\r\n“this passage contains many foolish statements.” Also that there is “an\r\nobvious intermixture in it of truth and falsehood.”\r\n\r\n[1392] This is universally admitted to have been one of the most\r\nsplendid works of art. It is celebrated by various writers; Pausanias\r\nspeaks of it in B. i. See also B. xxxvi. c. 4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1393] As being made for the Temple of Diana at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n[1394] Probably “Callimorphos,” or “Calliste.” We learn from Pausanias\r\nthat it was placed in the Citadel of Athens. Lucian prefers it to every\r\nother work of Phidias.\r\n\r\n[1395] A figure of a female “holding keys.” The key was one of the\r\nattributes of Proserpina, as also of Janus; but the latter was an\r\nItalian divinity.\r\n\r\n[1396] “Ædem Fortunæ hujusce diei.” This reading, about which there has\r\nbeen some doubt, is supported by an ancient inscription in Orellius.\r\n\r\n[1397] “Artem toreuticen.” See Note at the end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[1398] Pliny has here confounded two artists of the same name; the\r\nPolycletus who was the successor of Phidias, and was not much inferior\r\nto him in merit, and Polycletus of Argos, who lived 160 years later,\r\nand who also executed many capital works, some of which are here\r\nmentioned. It appears that Cicero, Vitruvius, Strabo, Quintilian,\r\nPlutarch, and Lucian have also confounded these two artists; but\r\nPausanias, who is very correct in the account which he gives us of all\r\nsubjects connected with works of art, was aware of the distinction; and\r\nit is from his observations that we have been enabled to correct the\r\nerror into which so many eminent writers had fallen.—B.\r\n\r\n[1399] Derived from the head-dress of the statue, which had the “head\r\nornamented with a fillet.” Lucian mentions it.\r\n\r\n[1400] The “Spear-bearer.”\r\n\r\n[1401] “Canon.” This no doubt was _the same_ statue as the Doryphoros.\r\nSee Cicero, Brut. 86, 296.\r\n\r\n[1402] Or “strigil.” Visconti says that this was a statue of Tydeus\r\npurifying himself from the murder of his brother. It is represented on\r\ngems still in existence.\r\n\r\n[1403] “Talo incessentem.” “Gesner (Chrestom. Plin.) has strangely\r\nexplained these words as intimating a person _in the act of kicking\r\nanother_. He seems to confound the words _talus_ and _calx_.”—Sillig,\r\nDict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1404] “The players at dice.” This is the subject of a painting found\r\nat Herculaneum.—B.\r\n\r\n[1405] The “Leader.” A name given also to Mercury, in Pausanias, B.\r\nviii. c. 31. See Sillig, Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1406] “Carried about.” It has been supposed by some commentators, that\r\nArtemon acquired this surname from his being carried about in a litter,\r\nin consequence of his lameness; a very different derivation has been\r\nassigned by others to the word, on the authority of Anacreon, as quoted\r\nby Heraclides Ponticus, that it was applied to Artemon in consequence\r\nof his excessively luxurious and effeminate habits of life.—B. It was\r\nevidently a recumbent figure. Ajasson compares this voluptuous person\r\nto “_le gentleman Anglais aux Indes_”—“The English Gentleman in India!”\r\n\r\n[1407] See Note 1397 above.\r\n\r\n[1408] “Quadrata.” Brotero quotes a passage from Celsus, B. ii c. 1,\r\nwhich serves to explain the use of this term as applied to the form\r\nof a statue; “Corpus autem habilissimum quadratum est, neque gracile,\r\nneque obesum.”—B. “The body best adapted for activity is square-built,\r\nand neither slender nor obese.”\r\n\r\n[1409] “Ad unum exemplum.” Having a sort of family likeness, similarly\r\nto our pictures by Francia the Goldsmith, and Angelica Kaufmann.\r\n\r\n[1410] Myron was born at Eleutheræ, in Bœotia; but having been\r\npresented by the Athenians with the freedom of their city, he\r\nafterwards resided there, and was always designated an Athenian.—B.\r\n\r\n[1411] This figure is referred to by Ovid, De Ponto, B. iv. Ep. 1, l.\r\n34, as also by a host of Epigrammatic writers in the Greek Anthology.\r\n\r\n[1412] See the Greek Anthology, B. vi. Ep. 2.\r\n\r\n[1413] “Player with the Discus.” It is mentioned by Quintilian and\r\nLucian. There is a copy of it in marble in the British Museum, and\r\none in the Palazzo Massimi at Home. The Heifer of Myron is mentioned\r\nby Procopius, as being at Rome in the sixth century. No copy of it is\r\nknown to exist.\r\n\r\n[1414] Seen by Pausanias in the Acropolis at Athens.\r\n\r\n[1415] Or “Sawyers.”\r\n\r\n[1416] In reference to the story of the Satyr Marsyas and Minerva, told\r\nby Ovid, Fasti, B. vi. l. 697, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[1417] Persons engaged in the five contests of quoiting, running,\r\nleaping, wrestling, and hurling the javelin.\r\n\r\n[1418] Competitors in boxing and wrestling.\r\n\r\n[1419] Mentioned by Cicero In Verrem, Or. 4. This Circus was in the\r\nEleventh Region of the city.\r\n\r\n[1420] See the Anthology, B. iii. Ep. 14, where an epigram on this\r\nsubject is ascribed to Anytes or Leonides; but the Myro mentioned is a\r\nfemale. See Sillig, Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1421] She was a poetess of Teios or Lesbos, and a contemporary of\r\nSappho.\r\n\r\n[1422] “Multiplicasse veritatem.” Sillig has commented at some length\r\non this passage, Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1423] See Note 1418 above.\r\n\r\n[1424] There is a painter of this name mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 43. The\r\nreading is extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n[1425] Mentioned by Plato, De Legibus, B. viii. and by Pausanias, B.\r\nvi. c. 13. He was thrice victorious at the Olympic Games.\r\n\r\n[1426] Python.\r\n\r\n[1427] From the Greek word Δικαιὸς, “just,” or “trustworthy.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1428] Diogenes Laertius mentions a Pythagoras, a statuary, in his\r\nlife of his celebrated namesake, the founder of the great school of\r\nphilosophy.—B. Pausanias, B. ix. c. 33, speaks of a Parian statuary of\r\nthis name.\r\n\r\n[1429] See Note 1395 above.\r\n\r\n[1430] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[1431] Cicero remarks, Brut. 86, 296, “that Lysippus used to say\r\nthat the Doryphoros of Polycletus was his master,” implying that\r\nhe considered himself indebted for his skill to having studied the\r\nabove-mentioned work of Polycletus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1432] In Chapter 17 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1433] The same subject, which, as mentioned above, had been treated by\r\nPolycletus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1434] In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1435] Ἀποξυόμενος, the Greek name of the statue, signifying\r\none “scraping himself.”\r\n\r\n[1436] The head encircled with rays.\r\n\r\n[1437] The lines of Horace are well known, in which he says, that\r\nAlexander would allow his portrait to be painted by no one except\r\nApelles, nor his statue to be made by any one except Lysippus, Epist.\r\nB. ii. Ep. 1, l. 237.—B.\r\n\r\n[1438] This expression would seem to indicate that the gold was\r\nattached to the bronze by some mechanical process, and not that the\r\nstatue was covered with thin leaves of the metal.—B.\r\n\r\n[1439] This story is adopted by Apuleius, in the “Florida,” B. i., who\r\nsays that Polycletus was the only artist who made a statue of Alexander.\r\n\r\n[1440] A large group of equestrian statues, representing those of\r\nAlexander’s body-guard, who had fallen at the battle of the Granicus.\r\n\r\n[1441] A.U.C. 606.\r\n\r\n[1442] See the Greek Anthology, B. iv. Ep. 14, where this subject is\r\ntreated of in the epigram upon his statue of Opportunity, represented\r\nwith the forelock.\r\n\r\n[1443] Which is a word of Greek origin, somewhat similar to our word\r\n“proportion.”\r\n\r\n[1444] At Lebadæa in Bœotia.\r\n\r\n[1445] Hardouin seems to think that “fiscina” here means a “muzzle.”\r\nThe Epigram in the Greek Anthology, B. iv. c. 7, attributed to King\r\nPhilip, is supposed by Hardouin to bear reference to this figure.\r\n\r\n[1446] The circumstance here referred to is related by Q. Curtius, B.\r\nix. c. 5, as having occurred at the siege of the city of the Oxydracæ;\r\naccording to other historians, however, it is said to have taken place\r\nat a city of the Malli.—B.\r\n\r\n[1447] See Note 1417, above.\r\n\r\n[1448] Κατάγουσα; a figure of Ceres, probably, “leading back”\r\nProserpine from the domains of Pluto. Sillig, however, dissents from\r\nthis interpretation; Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1449] Or Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[1450] See Pausanias, B. i. c. 20. Sillig says, “Pliny seems to have\r\nconfounded two Satyrs made by Praxiteles, for that here named stood\r\nalone in the ‘Via Tripodum’ at Athens, and was quite different from the\r\none which was associated with the figure of Intoxication, and that of\r\nBacchus.”—Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1451] “Much-famed.” Visconti is of opinion that the Reposing Satyr,\r\nformerly in the Napoleon Museum at Paris, was a copy of this statue.\r\nWinckelmann is also of the same opinion.\r\n\r\n[1452] In the Second Region of the city. According to Cicero, in\r\nVerrem. vi., they were brought from Achaia by L. Mummius, who took them\r\nfrom Thespiæ, A.U.C. 608.\r\n\r\n[1453] See B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1454] A woman plaiting garlands.\r\n\r\n[1455] A soubriquet for an old hag, it is thought.\r\n\r\n[1456] A female carrying wine.\r\n\r\n[1457] According to Valerius Maximus, B. ii. s. 10, these statues were\r\nrestored, not by Alexander, but by his successor Seleucus.—B. Sillig\r\nmakes the following remark upon this passage—“Pliny here strangely\r\nconfounds the statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton, made by Praxiteles,\r\nwith other figures of those heroes of a much more ancient date, made by\r\nAntenor.”\r\n\r\n[1458] From σαυρὸς a “lizard,” and κτείνω, “to kill.” This statue\r\nis described by Martial, B. xiv. Ep. 172, entitled “Sauroctonos\r\nCorinthius.”—B. Many fine copies of it are still in existence, and\r\nWinckelmann is of opinion that the bronze at the Villa Albani is the\r\noriginal. There are others at the Villa Borghese and in the Vatican.\r\n\r\n[1459] In her worthless favours, probably. Praxiteles was a great\r\nadmirer of Phryne, and inscribed on the base of this statue an Epigram\r\nof Simonides, preserved in the Greek Anthology, B. iv. Ep. 12. She was\r\nalso said to have been the model of his Cnidian Venus.\r\n\r\n[1460] This artist is mentioned also by Cicero, Pausanias, Propertius,\r\nand Ovid, the two latter especially remarking the excellence of his\r\nhorses.—B. See B. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1461] The mother of Hercules.—B.\r\n\r\n[1462] See B. xxxvi. c. 4. Having now given an account of the artists\r\nmost distinguished for their genius, Pliny proceeds to make some\r\nremarks upon those who were less famous, in alphabetical order.—B.\r\n\r\n[1463] The “highly approved.”\r\n\r\n[1464] Or “Lioness.” See B. vii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[1465] The reading is doubtful here. “Iphicrates” and “Tisicrates” are\r\nother readings.\r\n\r\n[1466] The same story is related by Athenæus, B. xiii., and by\r\nPausanias.—B.\r\n\r\n[1467] Pisistratus and his sons, Hippias and Hipparchus.\r\n\r\n[1468] A lioness.\r\n\r\n[1469] She having bitten off her tongue, that she might not confess.\r\n\r\n[1470] Hardouin has offered a plausible conjecture, that for the\r\nword “Seleucum,” we should read “Salutem,” as implying that the two\r\nstatues executed by Bryaxis were those of Æsculapius and the Goddess of\r\nHealth.—B.\r\n\r\n[1471] Already mentioned as a son of Lysippus.\r\n\r\n[1472] In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1473] This reading appears preferable to “Cresilas,” though the latter\r\nis supported by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[1474] Ajasson quotes here the beautiful words of Virgil—“Et dulces\r\nmoriens reminiscitur Argos”—“Remembers his lov’d Argos, as he dies.”\r\n\r\n[1475] Dalechamps supposes that Pericles was here represented in the\r\nact of addressing the people; Hardouin conceives that this statue\r\nreceived its title from the thunder of his eloquence in debate, or else\r\nfrom the mighty power which he wielded both in peace and war, or some\r\nof the other reasons which Plutarch mentions in the Life of Pericles.—B.\r\n\r\n[1476] It is doubtful to which of the artists of this name he alludes,\r\nthe elder or the younger Cephisodotus, the son of Praxiteles. Sillig\r\ninclines to think the former—Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1477] The “Deliverer.”\r\n\r\n[1478] The elder Canachus, probably.\r\n\r\n[1479] The “Lovely.” Brotero says that this is believed to be the\r\nFlorentine Apollo of the present day. It stood in the Temple at Didymi,\r\nnear Miletus, until the return of Xerxes from his expedition against\r\nGreece, when it was removed to Ecbatana, but was afterwards restored by\r\nSeleucus Nicator.\r\n\r\n[1480] See B. v. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1481] “Alterno morsu calce digitisque retinentibus solum, ita\r\nvertebrato dente utrisque in partibus ut a repulsu per vices resiliat.”\r\nHe seems to mean that the statue is so made as to be capable of\r\nstanding either on the right fore foot and the left hind foot, or on\r\nthe left fore foot and the right hind foot, the conformation of the\r\nunder part of the foot being such as to fit into the base.\r\n\r\n[1482] The following are the words of the original: “Ita vertebrato\r\ndente utrisque in partibus.” I confess myself unable to comprehend\r\nthem, nor do I think that they are satisfactorily explained by\r\nHardouin’s comment.—B.\r\n\r\n[1483] The “Riders on horseback.”\r\n\r\n[1484] It is supposed by Sillig, Dict. Ancient Artists, that this\r\nis the same person as the Cresilas, Ctesilas, or Ctesilaüs, before\r\nmentioned in this Chapter, and that Pliny himself has committed a\r\nmistake in the name.\r\n\r\n[1485] A figure of a man “brandishing a spear.” See Note 1400 above.\r\n\r\n[1486] He is mentioned by Quintilian as being more attentive to\r\nexactness than to beauty; also by Diogenes Laertius, B. v. c. 85.\r\nSillig supposes that he flourished in the time of Pericles. Pausanias,\r\nB. i., speaks of his Lysimache.\r\n\r\n[1487] The Athenians in their flattery, as we learn from Seneca,\r\nexpressed a wish to affiance their Minerva Musica to Marc Antony. His\r\nreply was, that he would be happy to take her, but with one thousand\r\ntalents by way of portion.\r\n\r\n[1488] He is mentioned by Xenophon, according to whom, he dedicated the\r\nbrazen statue of a horse in the Eleusinium at Athens. He was probably\r\nan Athenian by birth.\r\n\r\n[1489] Son of Patroclus, who is previously mentioned as having lived in\r\nthe 95th Olympiad. He was a native of Sicyon, and flourished about B.C.\r\n400. Several works of his are also mentioned by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1490] Or “strigil.” See Note 1435 above.\r\n\r\n[1491] The first Grecian slain at Troy.\r\n\r\n[1492] Famous also as a painter. See B. xxxv. c. 40.—B. Paris, the son\r\nof Priam, was known by both of these names.\r\n\r\n[1493] Q. Lutatius Catulus.\r\n\r\n[1494] “Bonus Eventus;” Varro, de Re Rustica, B. i. c. 1, applies\r\nthis term to one of the deities that preside over the labours of the\r\nagriculturist. His temple was situate near the Baths of Agrippa.—B.\r\n\r\n[1495] In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1496] See Note 1395, page 171.\r\n\r\n[1497] Pausanias, B. vi., speaks of a statue of Ancient Greece, but the\r\nname of the artist is not mentioned.—B.\r\n\r\n[1498] See B. iv. c, 8.\r\n\r\n[1499] Brotero informs us, from Ficoroni, that there is a gem still in\r\nexistence on which this design of Eutychides is engraved.—B.\r\n\r\n[1500] Thiersch considers him to be identical with the elder Hegesias.\r\nHe is mentioned also by Pausanias, B. viii. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[1501] See Note 1483, above.\r\n\r\n[1502] Dedicated by Augustus on the Capitoline Hill, in the Eighth\r\nRegion of the City.\r\n\r\n[1503] Sillig distinguishes three artists of this name.\r\n\r\n[1504] See B. v. c. 40, and B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[1505] The “Sacrificers of the ox.”\r\n\r\n[1506] The son also.\r\n\r\n[1507] Martial expresses the same idea in his Epigram, B. i. Ep. 7; but\r\nhe does not refer to this statue.—B. Two copies of this Ganymede are\r\nstill in existence at Rome.\r\n\r\n[1508] Pausanias informs us, B. i. and B. ix., that he saw this statue\r\nin the Prytanæum of Athens.—B. Autolycus obtained this victory about\r\nthe 89th or 90th Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[1509] It was in honour of a victory gained by him in the _pentathlon_\r\nat the Great Panathenæa, that Callias gave the Symposium described by\r\nXenophon.\r\n\r\n[1510] Martial, B. ix. Ep. 51, where he is pointing at the analogy\r\nbetween his poems and 95the works of the most eminent sculptors,\r\nprobably refers to this statue:—\r\n\r\n“Nos facimus Bruti puerum, nos Lagona vivum.”—B.\r\n\r\nThe reading “Lagonem,” or “Langonem,” certainly seems superior to that\r\nof the Bamberg MS.—“Mangonem,” a “huckster.”\r\n\r\n[1511] For some further mention of him, see end of B. iv.\r\n\r\n[1512] Delafosse has pointed out the resemblance between this statue\r\nand one of the works of Michael Angelo, representing David kneeling on\r\nGoliath, and pressing back the giant’s neck.—B.\r\n\r\n[1513] A native of Argos, who flourished in the 95th Olympiad. He was\r\nthe son of Motho, and brother and instructor of the younger Polycletus\r\nof Argos. Several of his statues are mentioned by Pausanias and Tatian.\r\n\r\n[1514] Ajasson thinks that three statues in the Royal Museum at Paris\r\nmay possibly be copies of this Discobolus of Naucydes.\r\n\r\n[1515] The Goddess of Health, and daughter of Æsculapius. Niceratus was\r\na native of Athens, and is also mentioned by Tatian.\r\n\r\n[1516] A “Female sacrificing.” The reading is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[1517] The “Man cooking entrails.” For some further account of this\r\nstatue, see B. xxii. c. 20. This artist is unknown, but Thiersch\r\nsuggests that he may have been the father of Cleomenes, whose name\r\nappears on the base of the Venus de Medicis.\r\n\r\n[1518] The master of the Gymnasium.\r\n\r\n[1519] He is twice mentioned by Pausanias: more particularly for the\r\nexcellence of his horses and oxen. His country is unknown.\r\n\r\n[1520] “The beautiful-legged.” This statue has been mentioned at the\r\nend of Chapter 18, as having been greatly admired by Nero.\r\n\r\n[1521] This, it is supposed, is the statue to which Martial alludes in\r\nhis Epigram, mentioned in Note 1510 above.—B.\r\n\r\n[1522] There were two artists of this name, both natives of Samos. The\r\npresent is the elder Theodorus, and is mentioned by Pausanias as having\r\nbeen the first to fuse iron for statues. He is spoken of by numerous\r\nancient authors, and by Pliny in B. vii. c. 57, B. xxxv. c. 45, and B.\r\nxxxvi. c. 19, where he is erroneously mentioned as a Lemnian.\r\n\r\n[1523] At Crete: Athenagoras mentions him in conjunction with Dædalus.\r\n\r\n[1524] See B. vii. c. 21. Hardouin thinks that this bears reference to\r\nthe conquest of the younger Marius by Sylla, mentioned in B. xxxiii. c.\r\n5. Müller and Meyer treat this story of the brazen statue as a fiction.\r\n\r\n[1525] Probably the same author that is mentioned at the end of B.\r\nxxxiii. See also B. xxxv. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[1526] The Galli here spoken of were a tribe of the Celts, who invaded\r\nAsia Minor, and afterwards uniting with the Greeks, settled in a\r\nportion of Bithynia, which hence acquired the name of Gallo-Græcia or\r\nGalatia.—B.\r\n\r\n[1527] See end of B. xxxiii. Attalus I., king of Pergamus, conquered\r\nthe Galli, B.C. 239. Pyromachus has been mentioned a few lines before,\r\nand Stratonicus, in B. xxxiii. c. 55, also by Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[1528] A native of Carthage. A work of his is mentioned by Cicero, in\r\nVerrem 4, 14, and in the Culex, l. 66, attributed to Virgil. See also\r\nB. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1529] In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1530] We are informed by Pausanias, B. x., that Nero carried off from\r\nGreece 500 bronze statues of gods and men.—B.\r\n\r\n[1531] See B. xxxvi. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1532] See B. xxxv. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1533] Mentioned by Pausanias, B. vi. Many of these artists are\r\naltogether unknown.\r\n\r\n[1534] See B. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1535] See B. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1536] See B. xxxiii. c. 56, and B. xxxv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1537] Probably the same artist that has been mentioned in the\r\npreceding page.\r\n\r\n[1538] The artist already mentioned as having been represented by\r\nSilanion.\r\n\r\n[1539] Pausanias, B. iii., speaks of his statue of Cynisca, a female\r\nwho was victor at the Olympic games. Indeed, the victors at these games\r\nwere frequently represented in a posture resembling that of adoration.\r\n\r\n[1540] A man “scraping himself,” probably. See Note 1435, page 175. The\r\n“Tyrannicides” were Harmodius and Aristogiton.\r\n\r\n[1541] Tatian mentions an artist of this name.\r\n\r\n[1542] Sillig thinks that this was Seleucus, king of Babylon, B.C. 312.\r\n\r\n[1543] See Note 1485 above.\r\n\r\n[1544] Pausanias, B. viii., gives an account of a statue of Diana, made\r\nof Pentelican marble, by this Cephisodotus, a native of Athens; he is\r\nsupposed to have flourished in the 102nd Olympiad. In the commencement\r\nof this Chapter, Pliny has enumerated a Cephisodotus among the artists\r\nof the 120th Olympiad.—B.\r\n\r\n[1545] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[1546] The elder artist of this name. See B. xxxv. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[1547] A native of Sicyon; Pausanias, B. v. cc. 17, 21, informs us\r\nthat Cleon made a statue of Venus and two statues of Jupiter; he also\r\nmentions others of his works in B. vi.—B.\r\n\r\n[1548] A native of Megara. He made a statue of Diagoras the pugilist,\r\nwho was victor at the Olympic games, B.C. 464. He is mentioned also by\r\nPausanias.\r\n\r\n[1549] Probably the same with the “Laïppus” mentioned in the early part\r\nof this Chapter. Sillig, Dict. Ancient Artists, considers “Daïppus” to\r\nbe the right name.\r\n\r\n[1550] See Note 1540 above.\r\n\r\n[1551] A native of Sicyon, and pupil of Pison, according to Pausanias,\r\nB. vi. c. 3. He flourished about the 100th Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[1552] Works of his at Athens are mentioned by Pausanias, B. i. c. 2,\r\nwho also states that he was father of Euchir, the Athenian.\r\n\r\n[1553] A statuary of Syracuse, son of Niceratus. He made two statues\r\nof Hiero II., king of Syracuse, who died B.C. 215. He must not be\r\nconfounded with the painter and statuary of the same name, mentioned in\r\nB. xxxiii. c. 56, and B. xxxv. c. 35. He is mentioned also by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1554] An Athenian, son of Euctemon. He is mentioned also by Tatian,\r\nand is supposed by Sillig to have flourished about B.C. 420.\r\n\r\n[1555] Called Dinomache by Plutarch.\r\n\r\n[1556] Already mentioned as a successful pupil of Lysippus.\r\n\r\n[1557] He was probably a native of Agrigentum, and flourished about\r\nB.C. 560. The brazen bull of Perillus, and his unhappy fate, are\r\nrecorded by many of the classical writers, among others by Valerius\r\nMaximus, B. ix. cc. 2, 9, and by Ovid, Art. Am. B. i. ll. 653-4.—B.\r\n\r\n[1558] See B. vii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1559] Mentioned at the commencement of this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1560] A statuary of Ægina, mentioned also by Pausanias, B. v. c. 27,\r\nin connexion with Dionysius of Argos. He flourished about Olymp. 76.\r\n\r\n[1561] Already mentioned in B. xxxiii. c. 55, and previously in this\r\nChapter.\r\n\r\n[1562] “Scopas uterque.” Sillig, Dict. Ancient Artists, expresses\r\nan opinion that these words are an interpolation; but in his last\r\nedition of Pliny, he thinks with M. Ian, that some words are wanting,\r\nexpressive of the branch in which these artists excelled. See also B.\r\nxxxvi. cc. 5, 14.\r\n\r\n[1563] He is previously mentioned in this Chapter. See p. 179.\r\n\r\n[1564] An Athenian artist, son of Eubulides. He is also mentioned by\r\nPausanias.\r\n\r\n[1565] A Lacedæmonian artist, also mentioned by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1566] See B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1567] Mentioned also by Pausanias, B. i. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[1568] Probably _not_ the Athenian statuary mentioned by Pausanias, B.\r\nix. c. 7. See Sillig, Dict. Ancient Artists.\r\n\r\n[1569] A native of Phocis, mentioned also by Vitruvius.\r\n\r\n[1570] Also a Dithyrambic poet; mentioned by Diodorus Siculus.\r\n\r\n[1571] In B. xxxv. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[1572] See B. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1573] Mentioned by Tatian as having made the statue of Eutychis. See\r\nPliny, B. vii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[1574] He executed a statue of Hephæstion; and an inscription relative\r\nto him is preserved by Wheler, Spon, and Chishull.\r\n\r\n[1575] See B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[1576] A native of Sardis; mentioned by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1577] An Athenian, mentioned also by Pausanias.\r\n\r\n[1578] Strabo mentions some of his productions in the Temple at Ephesus.\r\n\r\n[1579] “Fritterer away of his works.” He was also an engraver on gold,\r\nand a painter. He is spoken of in high terms by Vitruvius, Pausanias,\r\nand Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\r\n\r\n[1580] We have an account of Cato’s honourable conduct on this occasion\r\nin Plutarch.—B. See also B. xxix. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[1581] “Inane exemplum.” Hardouin thinks that this is said in reference\r\nto his neglect of the example set by his grandfather, Cato the Censor,\r\nwho hated the Greeks. See B. vii. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[1582] In the poisoned garment, which was the eventual cause of his\r\ndeath.—B.\r\n\r\n[1583] The general who conducted the war against Mithridates.—B.\r\n\r\n[1584] See B. xxxiii. c. 46. “Chaplet” copper.\r\n\r\n[1585] “Bar” copper, or “malleable.”\r\n\r\n[1586] It is very improbable that this effect could be produced by the\r\ncause here assigned; but without a more detailed account of the process\r\nemployed, we cannot explain the change of colour.—B.\r\n\r\n[1587] Πυρωπὸς, “sparkling like fire.” Similar to, if not identical\r\nwith, our tinsel.\r\n\r\n[1588] “Cast brass.”\r\n\r\n[1589] See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 415. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1590] In the former Editions the whole of the next ten lines, from\r\nthis word down to “sun” is omitted. It is evident that it has been\r\nleft out by accident, in consequence of the recurrence of the word\r\n“Campano.” The hiatus has been supplied from the Bamberg MS., and the\r\nreading is supported by the text of Isidorus, Orig. B. xvi. c. 20, s. 9.\r\n\r\n[1591] “Collectanei.”\r\n\r\n[1592] “Formalis.”\r\n\r\n[1593] “Plumbi nigri”—“black lead,” literally, but not what _we_ mean\r\nby that name.\r\n\r\n[1594] The “Grecian” colour. It does not appear to have been\r\nidentified, nor does it appear what it has to do with moulds.\r\n\r\n[1595] “Pot” copper, or brass.\r\n\r\n[1596] Beckmann is of opinion that this “plumbum argentarium” was a\r\nmixture of equal parts of tin and lead. Hist. Inv. Vol. II, p. 220.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1597] Most of these preparations are in reality highly dangerous.\r\nOxides, however, or salts of copper, have been employed internally\r\nwith success, acting by alvine evacuation and by vomiting. The _Crocus\r\nVeneris_ of the old chemists was an oxide of copper. It is still used\r\nby the peasants of Silesia, Ajasson says.\r\n\r\n[1598] It is obvious that the “cadmia” here described must be an\r\nessentially different substance from the “cadmia” mentioned in the\r\nsecond Chapter of this Book, that being a natural production, possibly\r\ncalamine or hydrosilicate or carbonate of zinc; while the “cadmia”\r\nof this Chapter is a furnace-calamine, a product of the fusion of\r\nthe ore of copper, or zinc.—B. It is evident, too, that copper ores,\r\nimpregnated with zinc or calamine, also passed under this name. See\r\nBeckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 33-35, _Bohn’s Edition_, where this\r\nsubject is discussed at considerable length: also the treatise by\r\nDelafosse, in Lemaire’s Edition of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1599] The metal known to us as “cadmium” was discovered by Professor\r\nStromeyer in 1818: it is either associated in its ores with zinc, or\r\nforms a native sulphuret.\r\n\r\n[1600] “Smoky residue.” None of these substances formed in smelting are\r\npreserved for medicinal purposes at the present day. Tutty is an impure\r\noxide of zinc.\r\n\r\n[1601] “Cluster residue.” From its resemblance to a bunch of grapes.\r\n\r\n[1602] “Caked residue.”\r\n\r\n[1603] “Shell-formed residue.”\r\n\r\n[1604] See B. xiv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[1605] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1606] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[1607] We have the same account of the medicinal effects of Cadmia,\r\nand the other preparations mentioned in this Chapter, given by\r\nDioscorides.—B.\r\n\r\n[1608] For an account of the “alumen” of the ancients, see B. xxxv. c.\r\n52.\r\n\r\n[1609] See B. xxxiii. c. 21, and B. xxxvi. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[1610] See B. xxxiii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1611] “Æris flos.” Ajasson makes some correct remarks upon the\r\ndifference between the “scoria” and the “flower” of the metal. The\r\nformer may be considered as consisting of the metal, mixed with a\r\ncertain proportion of heterogeneous matter, which has been separated\r\nduring the fusion of the ore, while the latter consists of the pure\r\nmetal in a state of mechanical division.—B.\r\n\r\n[1612] From the Greek λεπὶς, “husk,” or “scale.”\r\n\r\n[1613] Ajasson describes this substance as consisting merely of the\r\npure metal in a state of minute mechanical division; it would appear,\r\ntherefore, to be scarcely, if at all, different from the articles\r\ndescribed in the last Chapter. The word Στόμωμα means a “hard\r\nsubstance,” or “hard scales,” therefore the application of this term to\r\na substance like down, “lanugo,” is perhaps not very appropriate.—B.\r\n\r\n[1614] Beckmann comments at some length on this passage; Vol. I. p.\r\n328. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1615] “Seplasiæ.” The druggists dwelling in the Seplasia. See B.\r\nxxxiii. c. 58.\r\n\r\n[1616] In Chapters 22 and 23, as applied to Cadmia and Cyprian copper,\r\nrespectively.—B.\r\n\r\n[1617] “Ærugo.” The researches of modern chemists have ascertained the\r\ncomposition of verdigris to be a diacetete of copper; the sesquibasic\r\nacetate and the triacetate are also to be considered as varieties\r\nof this substance; we have an exact analysis of these salts in the\r\n“Elements” of the late Dr. Turner, the Sixth Edition, edited by\r\nProfessor Liebig and Mr. W. Turner, pp. 931, 2. Most of the processes\r\ndescribed in this Chapter are mentioned by Dioscorides.—B. See also\r\nBeckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 171, _et seq._, _Bohn’s Edition_.\r\n\r\n[1618] According to Brotero, this is the process generally adopted in\r\nFrance, in preference to the employment of vinegar in a pure state.—B.\r\n\r\n[1619] The form of copper which was termed “coronarium” has been\r\nalready described in Chapter 22.—B.\r\n\r\n[1620] “Atramento sutorio.” “Shoemakers’ black.” See Chapters 27 and 32\r\nof this Book.\r\n\r\n[1621] Until it assumes an ashy colour, Dioscorides says.—B.\r\n\r\n[1622] See B. xii. cc. 30, 32.\r\n\r\n[1623] According to Celsus, this substance obtained its name from\r\nthe person who invented or compounded it; he calls it “Collyrium of\r\nHierax.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1624] “Atramenti sutorii, quod chalcanthum vocant.” We may presume\r\nthat this substance was somewhat different from the “atramentum\r\nsutorium” mentioned in the last Chapter: the word “chalcanthum” means\r\n“flower of copper;” χαλκοῦ ἄνθος.—B. Delafosse identities\r\nit with blue vitriol, sulphate, or hydro-trisulphate of copper. See\r\nChapter 32.\r\n\r\n[1625] See Chapter 31.\r\n\r\n[1626] From the Greek σκωλὴξ, “a worm,” “Vermicular Verdigris.”—“The\r\naccounts of this substance in ancient authors seem to some commentators\r\nto be obscure; but in my opinion we are to understand by them that the\r\ningredients were pounded together till the paste they formed assumed\r\nthe appearance of pieces or threads like worms. For the same reason the\r\nItalians give the name of _vermicelli_ to wire-drawn paste of flour\r\nused in cookery.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 173, _Bohn’s Edition_.\r\n\r\n[1627] In B. xxxiii. c. 29.—B.\r\n\r\n[1628] The name, no doubt, of a copper ore which has not been\r\nidentified. Delafosse suggests that it may have been an ore of iron\r\nand copper pyrites in combination with a silky copper malachite. See\r\nChapter 2 of this Book, and B. xxxv. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[1629] Brongniart is of opinion that the “sory” of Pliny is the\r\nsulphate of copper, probably with an excess of acid. He informs us that\r\nhe has received a specimen of a native sulphate of copper from Cuença,\r\nin Spain, which possesses all the characteristics of “sory” as here\r\ndescribed. He considers it more difficult to ascertain the chemical\r\ncomposition of “misy,” but is disposed to consider it as a mixed\r\nsulphate of iron and copper.—B.\r\n\r\n[1630] In the next two Chapters.—B.\r\n\r\n[1631] We have a similar account of its medicinal virtues given us by\r\nDioscorides; Celsus also enumerates chalcitis among the corrosives, or\r\ncauteries, “quæ exedunt corpus.” He also recommends it for affections\r\nof the eyes.—B.\r\n\r\n[1632] “Sore ointment.”\r\n\r\n[1633] See Note 1629 above.\r\n\r\n[1634] See Note 1629 above. Hardouin calls this substance “yellow\r\ncopperas,” or “Roman vitriol.”\r\n\r\n[1635] “In scrobibus.” The mineral alluded to is Chalcitis, mentioned\r\nin Chapter 29.—B.\r\n\r\n[1636] Χαλκοῦ ἄνθος. “Flower of copper.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1637] “Atramentum sutorium.” It was thus called from its being used\r\nfor colouring leather. Under this name he probably includes green\r\nvitriol, or sulphate of the protoxide of iron, and blue vitriol, or\r\nsulphate, and hydro-trisulphate of copper, the former of which is,\r\nproperly, our copperas. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 181, _et\r\nseq._ _Bohn’s Edition._ See also Note 1624 above.\r\n\r\n[1638] In reality, the “chalcanthum” of Dioscorides was the small\r\nscales separated from molten copper by the application of water. See\r\nChapters 24 and 25 above.\r\n\r\n[1639] Of this kind, probably. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 182.\r\n\r\n[1640] From this _vitreous_ appearance of the crystals of vitriol, it\r\nis most probable that vitriol derives its name. See Beckmann, Vol. I.\r\np. 184.\r\n\r\n[1641] “Drop,” or “globule” chalcanthum.\r\n\r\n[1642] Possibly a corruption of “leucoion,” “violet white.”\r\n\r\n[1643] He has described the mode of procuring salt, by evaporating the\r\nbrine in shallow pits, in B. xxxi. c. 39.—B.\r\n\r\n[1644] It is difficult to ascertain the exact nature of the substances\r\ntreated of in this Chapter. Ajasson has some judicious remarks upon\r\nthem, in which he points out what appear to be inconsistencies in the\r\naccount given of them, and of their relation to each other.—B. Ajasson\r\nsays that there is no doubt that a mammose or terreous carbonate of\r\ncopper is meant under these names. These substances are no longer\r\nknown, but our tutty, or impure oxide of zinc, bears some resemblance\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n[1645] See B. xix. c. 4, and Chapters 34 and 52 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1646] A Greek word, signifying “ashes,” or the residuum after\r\ncombustion.—B.\r\n\r\n[1647] From the corresponding passage in Dioscorides, there is some\r\ndoubt whether the account of this process here given is correct.—B.\r\n\r\n[1648] So called from Laurium, a district in Attica, in which there\r\nwere silver mines. See Pausanias, B. i.—B.\r\n\r\n[1649] Meaning “Substitute for spodos.”\r\n\r\n[1650] See B. xxiii. cc. 38, 63.\r\n\r\n[1651] See B. xxi. c. 26, and B. xvi. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[1652] See B. xxi. c. 95.\r\n\r\n[1653] See B. xi. c. 94.—B.\r\n\r\n[1654] “Detersive composition.”\r\n\r\n[1655] From Δὶς φρυγέσθαι.—“being twice calcined.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1656] The Scoriæ, Cadmia, and Flos, which are described in Chapters\r\n22, 23 and 24.—B.\r\n\r\n[1657] A Roman coin, equal to the third part of the “as.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1658] We most fully coincide with Pliny in this sentiment, but we are\r\nconstrained to differ from him in giving credit to the alleged fact, as\r\nhe appears to have done.—B.\r\n\r\n[1659] See the list of authors at the end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1660] “Arbusta:” trees on which vines were trained. See B. xvii. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1661] Holland has the following Note upon this passage: “O Pliny, what\r\nwouldst thou say, if thou didst see and hear the pistols, muskets,\r\nculverines, and cannons in these days.” Vol. II. p. 513.—B.\r\n\r\n[1662] The charge that death is always the work of Nature.—B.\r\n\r\n[1663] Or “stylus.”\r\n\r\n[1664] See Ovid, Metam. B. iv. l. 467, _et seq._; and Fasti, B. vi. l.\r\n489, _et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[1665] An artist mentioned also by Ovid and Pausanias.—B. And by Virgil.\r\n\r\n[1666] “Mars Ultor.” In the Forum of Augustus, in the Eighth Region of\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\n[1667] The Isle of Elba, which has been celebrated for the extent and\r\nthe richness of its iron mines both by the ancients and the moderns.—B.\r\nAjasson remarks that it appears to be a solid rock composed of peroxide\r\nof iron.\r\n\r\n[1668] “Clavis caligariis.” See B. viii. c. 44, B. ix. c. 33, and B.\r\nxxii. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[1669] There have been numerous opinions on the meaning of this word,\r\nand its signification is very doubtful. Beckmann has the following\r\nremarks in reference to this passage:—“In my opinion, this was the name\r\ngiven to pieces of steel completely manufactured and brought to that\r\nstate which rendered them fit for commerce. At present steel comes\r\nfrom Biscay in cakes, from other places in bars, and both these were\r\nformerly called ‘stricturæ,’ because they were employed chiefly for\r\ngiving sharpness to instruments, or tools, that is, for steeling them.\r\nIn speaking of other metals, Pliny says that the finished productions\r\nat the works were not called ‘stricturæ’ (the case, for example, with\r\ncopper), though sharpness could be given to instruments with other\r\nmetals also. The words of Pliny just quoted are read different ways,\r\nand still remain obscure. I conjecture that he meant to say, that some\r\nsteel-works produced things which were entirely of steel, and that\r\nothers were employed only in steeling—‘ad densandas incudes malleorumve\r\nrostra.’ I shall here remark that these ‘stricturæ ferri’ remind us of\r\nthe ‘striges auri,’ (see B. xxxiii. c. 19), such being the name given\r\nto native pieces of gold, which, without being smelted, were used in\r\ncommerce.”—Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 327. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1670] “A stringendâ acie.” The iron was probably formed into thin,\r\nlong bars, in thickness resembling a steel used for sharpening. The\r\nFrench word _acier_, meaning “steel,” may possibly come from the Latin\r\n“acies”—“edge,” as Beckmann has suggested.\r\n\r\n[1671] Situate at the spot now known as “Bambola,” near Calatayud. The\r\nriver Salo ran near it, the waters of which, as here mentioned, were\r\ncelebrated for their power of tempering steel. The poet Martial was a\r\nnative of this place.\r\n\r\n[1672] Supposed to be the modern Tarragona.\r\n\r\n[1673] See B. iii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[1674] See B. vi. cc. 20-24, B. vii. c. 2, and B. xii. cc. 1, 41. This\r\nSeric iron has not been identified. Ctesias, as quoted by Photius,\r\nmentions Indian iron. Sec Beckmann, Vol. II. p. 228. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1675] Thought by Beckmann, quoting from Bottiger, possibly to bear\r\nreference to a transfer trade of furs, through Serica, from the North\r\nof Asia. See Vol. II. p. 307. As to the Seric tissues, see B. xxxvii.\r\nc. 77.\r\n\r\n[1676] Or “Persian.” The steel of Damascus had in the middle ages a\r\nhigh reputation.\r\n\r\n[1677] See B. iii. cc. 24, 27. Horace speaks of the “Norican sword” on\r\ntwo occasions.—B.\r\n\r\n[1678] See B. iii. cc. 9, 17.\r\n\r\n[1679] See B. xviii. c. 67, and B. xxxvi. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[1680] B. xxxvi. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[1681] Properly “bubbles,” or “beads.”\r\n\r\n[1682] See B. xxxvi. c. 66. In the account of the loadstone referred to\r\nabove, he informs us that this mineral was employed in the formation of\r\nglass.—B. Beckmann is of opinion that Manganese is here alluded to. See\r\nVol. II. p. 237.\r\n\r\n[1683] Another reading is “Dinochares,” or “Dinocrates,” for an account\r\nof whom, see B. v. c. 11, and B. vii. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[1684] Wife and sister of Ptolemy Philadelphus. See B. vi. c. 33, and\r\nB. xxxvi. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[1685] Some accounts state that the statue was to be of brass, and the\r\nhead of iron. It is said that the same thing was attempted with respect\r\nto the statue of Mahomet, in his tomb at Medina.—B.\r\n\r\n[1686] We learn from Bowles that the celebrated mine of Sommorostro is\r\nstill worked for this metal.\r\n\r\n[1687] See B. iv. c. 34.—B.\r\n\r\n[1688] Both the reading and the meaning of this passage are very\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[1689] See B. v. c. 21.—B.\r\n\r\n[1690] We may presume that Pliny supposed that the ancient links had\r\nbeen protected by some of the substances mentioned above, although this\r\nis not distinctly stated.—B. Or rather by some religious ceremony as\r\nabove alluded to.\r\n\r\n[1691] “Nocturnas lymphationes.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1692] The _actual_ cautery, as it is termed, is occasionally employed,\r\nin certain diseases, by the moderns, but I am not aware that it has\r\nbeen tried in hydrophobia.—B. This precaution is sometimes used by\r\ncountry practitioners, at all events.\r\n\r\n[1693] I cannot agree with Delafosse in his remark that “this remedy\r\nalso is much in use for cœliac and other affections at the present\r\nday.”—B. It is still recommended by old women in the country, for\r\nchildren more particularly.\r\n\r\n[1694] There are two versions of this story. In B. xxv. c. 19, Pliny\r\nsays that Achilles cured Telephus by the application of a plant, which\r\nfrom him received its name. According to the other account, the oracle\r\nhad declared, that the wound of Telephus, which had been inflicted by\r\nAchilles, could only be cured by means of the same weapon which had\r\ncaused it.—B.\r\n\r\n[1695] All the statements in this Chapter are to be found in\r\nDioscorides, B. v. c. 93.—B.\r\n\r\n[1696] The scaly excrescences beaten from iron in the forges, Hardouin\r\nsays.—B.\r\n\r\n[1697] From the Greek ὕγρον πλαστρὸν.—B.\r\n\r\n[1698] See B. xxxv. c. 57.—B.\r\n\r\n[1699] It is most probable that the “black lead” of Pliny was our lead,\r\nand the “white lead” our tin. Beckmann has considered these Chapters at\r\ngreat length, Vol. II. p. 209, _et seq._ _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1700] Supposed to have been derived from the Oriental word _Kastîra_.\r\n\r\n[1701] What is here adduced as a fabulous narrative is not very remote\r\nfrom the truth; the Scilly Isles and Cornwall being the principal\r\nsources of the tin now employed in Europe. Small boats, corresponding\r\nto the description here given, were very lately still in use among\r\nthe inhabitants of some parts of the south-west coast of England [and\r\non the Severn]. Pliny has already spoken of these boats in B. vii.\r\nc. 57.—B. See also B. iv. c. 30, as to the _coracles_ of the ancient\r\nBritons.\r\n\r\n[1702] The ores of tin are known to exist in Gallicia; but the mines in\r\nthat country are very scanty compared to those of Cornwall.—B.\r\n\r\n[1703] “Talutium” is mentioned in B. xxxiii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[1704] Tin ore is among the heaviest of minerals, though the specific\r\ngravity of the metal is small. M. Hæfer is of opinion that these\r\npebbles contained platinum.\r\n\r\n[1705] Or tin. The greater fusibility of the tin producing this\r\nseparation.—B.\r\n\r\n[1706] We may conclude that the “plumbum nigrum,” or “black lead”\r\nof Pliny is the Galena or sulphuret of lead of the moderns; it is\r\nfrequently what is termed argentiferous, _i.e._ united with an ore of\r\nsilver, and this in such quantity as to cause it to be worked for the\r\npurpose of procuring the silver.—B. See Beckmann, Vol. II. p. 210.\r\n\r\n[1707] “Instead of oil, workmen use at present ‘colophonium,’ or some\r\nother resin.”—Beckmann, Vol. II. p. 223. See also B. xxxiii. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[1708] Iliad, xi. 25, and xxiii. 561.—B.\r\n\r\n[1709] Ajasson considers this to be Bismuth; but it is more probable\r\nthat Beckmann is right in his conclusion, supported by Agricola,\r\nEntzel, Fallopius, Savot, Bernia, and Jung, that it was a compound\r\nmetal, the _Werk_ of the German smelting-houses] a metal not much\r\nunlike our pewter, probably. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 209,\r\n212, 224. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1710] See B. xxxiii. c. 31, and c. 53 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1711] A compound metal, probably, somewhat like pewter. See Note 1709\r\nabove. He evidently alludes to the process of “tinning.”\r\n\r\n[1712] In B. xxxiii. c. 45: where he says that the best mirrors were\r\nformerly made of a mixture of stannum and copper.—B. See Beckmann,\r\nHist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 60-62, 72.\r\n\r\n[1713] Or tin.\r\n\r\n[1714] “Silver mixture.”\r\n\r\n[1715] Such a mixture as this would in reality become _more valuable_\r\nthan “argentarium,” as the proportion would be _two-thirds_ of tin and\r\none of lead. How then could the workmen merit the title of dishonest?\r\nBeckmann suggests that the tinning ought to have been done with _pure\r\ntin_, but that unprincipled artists employed tin mixed with lead. It\r\nis most probable, however, that Pliny himself has made a mistake, and\r\nthat we should read “equal parts of black lead” (our lead); in which\r\ncase the mixture passed off as “argentarium,” instead of containing\r\n_equal_ parts of tin and lead, would contain _five-sixths_ of lead. See\r\nBeckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 221. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1716] All these readings are doubtful in the extreme.\r\n\r\n[1717] As being too brittle, probably; the reason suggested by\r\nBeckmann, Vol. II. p. 221.\r\n\r\n[1718] Literally, “inboiled,” being coated by immersion in the molten\r\ntin.\r\n\r\n[1719] Supposed by Hardouin to have been the town of Alise, in Auxois.\r\n\r\n[1720] See B. iv. c. 33.\r\n\r\n[1721] The names of various kinds of carriages, the form of which is\r\nnow unknown.\r\n\r\n[1722] Both tin and lead can be fused in paper, when it is closely\r\nwrapped around them.\r\n\r\n[1723] In reality India did and does possess them both; but it is\r\npossible that in those days it was not considered worth while to search\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n[1724] The “lead” of the moderns.\r\n\r\n[1725] Mr. T. Wright, the eminent antiquarian, is of opinion that the\r\nextensive Roman lead mines at Shelve, in Shropshire, are here alluded\r\nto. See the _Illustrated London News_, Oct. 4, 1856.\r\n\r\n[1726] Probably from Ovetum, the modern Oviedo.—B.\r\n\r\n[1727] So called from the island of Capraria. See B. iii. cc. 11, 12,\r\nand B. vi. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1728] See B. iii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[1729] Not in Bætica, as Brotero remarks, but in Lusitania, or\r\nPortugal; the modern Santarem.—B.\r\n\r\n[1730] See Introduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[1731] This circumstance is mentioned by Suetonius, c. 20.—B.\r\n\r\n[1732] Hardouin observes, that these insects are never met with in\r\nmines; but probably this may depend more upon other causes, than upon\r\nthe vapours which are supposed to proceed from the metals.—B.\r\n\r\n[1733] See B. xxxiii. cc. 33, 34.\r\n\r\n[1734] See B. xx. c. 81, and B. xxiv. c. 73.\r\n\r\n[1735] “Charta.” See B. xxiv. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[1736] This, according to Ajasson, is the protoxide, or probably, in\r\nsome cases, the arseniate of lead.—B.\r\n\r\n[1737] From σποδὸς, “ashes.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1738] See Chapter 34 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1739] This was probably lead ore in its primary state, when only\r\nseparated from the stannum, and before it was subjected to fusion for\r\nthe purpose of obtaining pure lead.—See Beckmann’s Hist. Inv. Vol. II.\r\np. 211. _Bohn’s Edition._ Ajasson identifies it with litharge, or fused\r\noxide of lead, known as gold and silver litharge, from its colour.\r\n\r\n[1740] See B. xxxiii. c. 31, and Chapter 47 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1741] In Cilicia: see B. v. c. 22. He is speaking, no doubt, of the\r\n“metallic,” or artificial kind.\r\n\r\n[1742] A kind of ointment. See B. xxiii. c. 81, and B. xxxiii. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1743] Our Litharge. See B. xxxiii. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[1744] According to Ajasson, this substance is properly a sub-carbonate\r\nof lead, commonly called white lead.—B.\r\n\r\n[1745] Scoria of lead and molybdæna.—B.\r\n\r\n[1746] Preparations of lead are still used in cosmetics for whitening\r\nthe complexion.\r\n\r\n[1747] The Realgar of the moderns, red orpiment, or red sulphuret of\r\narsenic. Pliny has in numerous places spoken of it as a remedy for\r\ncertain morbid states both of animals and vegetables, B. xvii. c. 47,\r\nB. xxiii. c. 13, B. xxv. c. 22, and B. xxviii. c. 62, but he has not\r\npreviously given any account of its origin and composition.—B.\r\n\r\n[1748] Dioscorides, B. v. c. 122, informs us, with respect to this\r\neffect of sandarach, that it was burned in combination with resin, and\r\nthat the smoke was inhaled through a tube.—B.\r\n\r\n[1749] The substance here mentioned, though its name is the foundation\r\nof our word “arsenic,” is not the arsenic of modern commerce, but\r\nprobably a sulphuret of arsenic containing a less proportion of sulphur\r\nthan the Sandarach of the last Chapter.—B.\r\n\r\n[1750] The other two mentioned species naturally divide into laminæ,\r\nwhile this kind is disposed to separate into fine fibres.—B.\r\n\r\n[1751] By this process a considerable portion of the sulphur is\r\nexpelled, so as to cause the orpiment to approximate to the state of\r\narsenic.—B.\r\n\r\n[1752] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1753] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1754] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[1755] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1756] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[1757] A different person from the Messala mentioned at the end of B.\r\nix.

See also Note 18, p. 196.\r\n\r\n[1795] Which he is ready to employ in carrying away his plunder.\r\n\r\n[1796] “Ceromata;” this is properly a Greek term, signifying an\r\nointment used by athletes, composed of oil and wax.—B.\r\n\r\n[1797] This practice is referred to by Cicero, De Finib. B. v.—B.\r\n\r\n[1798] In reality, his birth-day was not on the twentieth day of any\r\nmonth; but, for some reason which is not known, he fixed upon this\r\nday.—B. He was born on the seventh day of the month Gamelion.\r\n\r\n[1799] From the Greek εἰκὰς, the “twentieth” day of the month.\r\n\r\n[1800] In obedience to the maxim of Epicurus, Λάθε βιῶσας—“Live in\r\nobscurity.”\r\n\r\n[1801] See B. xxi. c. 49, and Note 2139, p. 346.\r\n\r\n[1802] This appears to have been the usual practice at the funerals\r\nof distinguished personages among the Romans: it is referred to\r\nby Tacitus, Ann. B. ii. c. 73, in his account of the funeral of\r\nGermanicus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1803] “Tabulina.” Rooms situate near the atrium.\r\n\r\n[1804] A cognomen of the Gens Valeria at Rome, from which the family of\r\nthe Messalæ had also originally sprung.\r\n\r\n[1805] So called from his father-in-law Pomponius, a man celebrated for\r\nhis wealth, and by whom he was adopted. It would appear that Scipio\r\nPomponianus adopted Scipio Salvitto, so called from his remarkable\r\nresemblance to an actor of mimes. See B. vii. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[1806] They were probably, like the Scipios, a branch of the Gens\r\nCornelia. Suetonius speaks in very derogatory terms of a member of this\r\nfamily, who accompanied Julius Cæsar in his Spanish campaign against\r\nthe Pompeian party.\r\n\r\n[1807] In the Greek Anthology, B. v., we have the imaginary portrait of\r\nHomer described at considerable length.—B.\r\n\r\n[1808] Hardouin supposes that this work was written by Cicero, and that\r\nhe named it after his friend Atticus; but, as Delafosse remarks, it is\r\nclear from the context that it was the work of Atticus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1809] M. Deville is of opinion that these portraits were made in\r\nrelief upon plates of metal, perhaps bronze, and coloured with minium,\r\na red tint much esteemed by the Romans.\r\n\r\n[1810] “Clypei.” These were shields or escutcheons of metal, with the\r\nfeatures of the deceased person represented either in painting or in\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n[1811] Hardouin informs us that there are some Greek inscriptions\r\ngiven by Gruter, p. 441, and p. 476, from which it appears that public\r\nfestivals were celebrated on occasions of this kind.—B.\r\n\r\n[1812] A.U.C. 671.—B. See B. vii. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[1813] See B. xxxvi. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[1814] It is scarcely necessary to refer to the well-known description\r\nof the shield of Achilles, in the Iliad, B. xviii. l. 478 _et seq._,\r\nand of that of Æneas, Æn. B. viii. l. 626, _et seq._—B.\r\n\r\n[1815] He implies that the word is derived from the Greek γλύφειν, “to\r\ncarve” or “emboss” and not from the old Latin “cluo,” “to be famous.”\r\nAjasson suggests the Greek καλύπτω “to cover.”\r\n\r\n[1816] Cneius and Publius Scipio, who had been slain by Hasdrubal.—B.\r\nAs to L. Marcius, see B. ii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[1817] See B. xxxiii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[1818] “Lustrations.” Periods at the end of the census, made by the\r\ncensors every five years. The censors were the guardians of the\r\ntemples, and consequently these bucklers would come under their\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n[1819] This period for the invention of painting by the Egyptians\r\nis evidently incorrect; but still there is sufficient reason for\r\nconcluding that there now exist specimens of Egyptian art, which were\r\nin existence previous to the time of the earliest Grecian painters of\r\nwhom we have any certain account.—B.\r\n\r\n[1820] All the ancients who have treated of the history of the art\r\nagree, that the first attempt at what may be considered the formation\r\nof a picture, consisted in tracing the shadow of a human head or some\r\nother object on the wall, the interior being filled up with one uniform\r\nshade of colour.—B.\r\n\r\n[1821] From the Greek μονοχρώματον, “single colouring.”—B.\r\n\r\n[1822] He is mentioned also by Athenagoras, Strabo, and Athenæus.\r\n\r\n[1823] Called “graphis,” by the Greeks, and somewhat similar, probably,\r\nto our pen and ink drawings.\r\n\r\n[1824] In Chapter 43 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1825] Ajasson remarks, that a great number of paintings have been\r\nlately discovered in the Etruscan tombs, in a very perfect state, and\r\nprobably of very high antiquity.—B.\r\n\r\n[1826] There would appear to be still considerable uncertainty\r\nrespecting the nature of the materials employed by the ancients, and\r\nthe manner of applying them, by which they produced these durable\r\npaintings; a branch of the art which has not been attained in equal\r\nperfection by the moderns.—B.\r\n\r\n[1827] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[1828] See B. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[1829] We have already remarked that painting was practised very\r\nextensively by the Egyptians, probably long before the period of the\r\nTrojan war.—B.\r\n\r\n[1830] Or “Health.” It was situate on the Quirinal Hill, in the Sixth\r\nRegion of the City.\r\n\r\n[1831] “Forum Boarium.” In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1832] Holbein and Mignard did the same.\r\n\r\n[1833] Q. Pedius was either nephew, or great nephew of Julius Cæsar,\r\nand had the command under him in the Gallic War; he is mentioned by\r\nCæsar in his Commentaries, and by other writers of this period.—B.\r\n\r\n[1834] Originally the palace of Tullus Hostilius, in the Second Region\r\nof the City.\r\n\r\n[1835] Asiaticus, the brother of the elder Africanus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1836] It was _before_ the decisive battle near Mount Sipylus, that the\r\nson of Africanus was made prisoner. King Antiochus received him with\r\nhigh respect, loaded him with presents, and sent him to Rome.—B.\r\n\r\n[1837] He was legatus under the consul L. Calpurnius Piso, in the Third\r\nPunic War, and commanded the Roman fleet. He was elected Consul B.C.\r\n145.\r\n\r\n[1838] The younger Scipio Africanus.\r\n\r\n[1839] We learn from Valerius Maximus, that C. Pulcher was the first to\r\nvary the scenes of the stage with a number of colours.—B.\r\n\r\n[1840] See Chapter 36 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1841] We have an amusing proof of this ignorance of Mummius given by\r\nPaterculus, B. i. c. 13, who says that when he had the choicest of\r\nthe Corinthian statues and pictures sent to Italy, he gave notice to\r\nthe contractors that if they lost any of them, they must be prepared\r\nto supply new ones. Ajasson offers a conjecture which is certainly\r\nplausible, that Mummius might possibly regard this painting as a\r\nspecies of talisman.—B.\r\n\r\n[1842] In the eleventh Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1843] “Sub Veteribus;” meaning that part of the Forum where the “Old\r\nShops” of the “argentarii” or money-brokers had stood.\r\n\r\n[1844] We have an anecdote of a similar event, related by Cicero, as\r\nhaving occurred to Julius Cæsar, De Oratore, B. ii. c. 66.—B.\r\n\r\n[1845] See B. vii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[1846] We have had this Temple referred to in B. ii. c. 23, B. vii.\r\nc. 39, B. viii. c. 64, and B. ix. c. 57: it is again mentioned in the\r\nfortieth Chapter of this Book, and in B. xxxvii. c. 5.—B.\r\n\r\n[1847] In the “Vaporarium,” namely.—B. The Thermæ of Agrippa were in\r\nthe Ninth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1848] According to Hardouin, this was done after the battle of Actium,\r\nin which Augustus subdued his rival Antony.—B.\r\n\r\n[1849] By adoption. The Temple of Julius Cæsar was in the Forum, in the\r\nEighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1850] See B. vii. c. 22, B. x. c. 60, and B. xxxiv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1851] In Chapter 36 of this Book.—B.\r\n\r\n[1852] See B. vii, cc. 45, 54, 60, and B. xxxiv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[1853] See B. vii. c. 54, B. xv. c. 20, B. xxxiii. c. 6, and B. xxxiv.\r\nc. 11.\r\n\r\n[1854] This was the personification of the Nemean forest in\r\nPeloponnesus, where Hercules killed the Lion, the first of the labours\r\nimposed upon him by Eurystheus.—B.\r\n\r\n[1855] See Chapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1856] “Inussisse;” meaning that he executed it in encaustic. The Greek\r\nterm used was probably ΕΝΕΚΑΥΣΕ.\r\n\r\n[1857] Hemsterhuys is of opinion that he was the brother of Æschines,\r\nthe orator, contemptuously alluded to by Demosthenes, Fals. Legat. Sec.\r\n237, as a painter of perfume pots. If so, he was probably an Athenian,\r\nand must have flourished about the 109th Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[1858] In Chapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1859] In B. xxxiii. c. 39. He alludes to cinnabaris, minium, rubrica,\r\nand sinopis.\r\n\r\n[1860] Meaning “new painting,” probably. The reading, however, is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n[1861] “Splendor.” Supposed by Wornum to be equivalent to our word\r\n“tone,” applied to a coloured picture, which comprehends both the\r\n“tonos” and the “harmoge” of the Greeks. Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art.\r\n_Painting_.\r\n\r\n[1862] “Tone,” says Fuseli, (in the English acceptation of the\r\nword) “is the element of the ancient ‘harmoge,’ that imperceptible\r\ntransition, which, without opacity, confusion, or hardness, united\r\nlocal colour, demitint, shade, and reflexes.”—Lect. I.\r\n\r\n[1863] “Austeri aut floridi.”\r\n\r\n[1864] Because of their comparatively great expense.\r\n\r\n[1865] See B. xxxiii. cc. 30, 37. Under this name are included\r\nSulphuret of mercury, and Red oxide of lead.\r\n\r\n[1866] See B. xxxiii. cc. 38, 39.\r\n\r\n[1867] See B. xxxiii. c. 26. “Indicum” and “purpurissum” will be\r\ndescribed in the present Book.\r\n\r\n[1868] Or “rubrica Sinopica;” “red earth of Sinope,” a brown red ochre,\r\nor red oxide of iron. Dioscorides identifies it with the Greek μιλτὸς,\r\nwhich indeed seems to have embraced the cinnabaris, minium, and rubricæ\r\nof the Romans.\r\n\r\n[1869] “Splendorem.” See Note 1861 above.\r\n\r\n[1870] So called from its deep grey brown colour, like that of the\r\n“cicer” or chick-pea.\r\n\r\n[1871] The sense of this passage seems to require the insertion of\r\n“quæ,” although omitted by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[1872] “Pressior.”\r\n\r\n[1873] Those parts of the walls, probably, which were nearer to the\r\nground, and more likely to become soiled.\r\n\r\n[1874] Red ochre, or red oxide of iron. See B. xxxiii. c. 38, and B.\r\nxxxiv. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1875] See B. xxxiii. cc. 36, 37.\r\n\r\n[1876] Ajasson thinks that this was an hydroxide of iron, of a greenish\r\nyellow or brown colour.\r\n\r\n[1877] Whence our word “ochre.” See “Sil,” in B. xxxiii. cc. 56, 57.\r\n\r\n[1878] Theophrastus, on the contrary, says that it is “ochra” that is\r\nburnt, in order to obtain “rubrica.”\r\n\r\n[1879] See B. xxxiii. cc. 56, 57.\r\n\r\n[1880] A white earth from the Isle of Melos. See Chapter 19.\r\n\r\n[1881] See B. xxxiii. c. 20. “One may readily conceive that this must\r\nhave been a ferruginous ochre, or kind of bole, which is still used as\r\na ground, _poliment, assiette_.”—Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 294.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1882] A white, much used for fresco painting. Ajasson is of opinion,\r\nthat Pliny, in this Chapter, like the other ancient authors, confounds\r\ntwo earths that are, in reality, totally different.—Hydrosilicate of\r\nmagnesia, or Steatite, and Rhomboidical carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n[1883] See B. v. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[1884] Ajasson thinks that possibly our compact magnesite, meerschaum,\r\nor sea-foam, may be the substance here alluded to.\r\n\r\n[1885] See Chapter 57 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1886] See B. iv. c. 33. Tournefort says that this earth is exactly\r\nsimilar to the Cimolian earth, described in Chapter 57.\r\n\r\n[1887] See B. xxxiii. c. 57, and Chapter 21 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1888] In B. xxxiv. c. 54.\r\n\r\n[1889] Ceruse, white lead, or carbonate of lead, is prepared in\r\nmuch the same manner at the present day. Ajasson is of opinion that\r\nthe native pigment discovered on the lands of Theodotus, was native\r\ncarbonate of lead, the crystals of which are found accompanied by\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\n[1890] “Burnt” ceruse. This was, in fact, one of the varieties of\r\n“minium,” red oxide of lead, our red lead. Vitruvius and Dioscorides\r\ncall it “sandaraca,” differing somewhat from that of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1891] In Chapter 10.\r\n\r\n[1892] See B. xxxiii. cc. 56, 57.\r\n\r\n[1893] It was possibly owing to this that the colour known as “umber”\r\nreceived its name, and not from Ombria, in Italy. Ajasson says that\r\nshadows cannot be successfully made without the use of transparent\r\ncolours, and that red and the several browns are remarkably transparent.\r\n\r\n[1894] See B. iv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[1895] As to both of these artists, see Chapter 36.\r\n\r\n[1896] To the chest.\r\n\r\n[1897] See B. vi. c. 34, and B. xxxvii. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[1898] In B. xxxiv. c. 55. “Pliny speaks of different shades of\r\nsandaraca, the pale, or massicot, (yellow oxide of lead), and a mixture\r\nof the pale with minium. It also signified Realgar, or red sulphuret of\r\narsenic.”—Wornum, in Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art. _Colores_.\r\n\r\n[1899] Sir H. Davy supposes this colour to have approached our crimson.\r\nIn painting, it was frequently glazed with purple, to give it an\r\nadditional lustre.\r\n\r\n[1900] Ecl. iv. l. 45. “Sponte suâ sandyx pascentes vestiet agnos.”\r\nAjasson thinks that “Sandyx” may have been a name common to two\r\ncolouring substances, a vegetable and a mineral, the former being our\r\nmadder. Beckmann is of the same opinion, and that Virgil has committed\r\nno mistake in the line above quoted. Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 110.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._ See also B. xxiv. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[1901] The form “_sand_,” in these words, Ajasson considers to be\r\nderived either from “Sandes,” the name of Hercules in Asia Minor, or at\r\nleast in Lydia] or else from Sandak, the name of an ancestor of Cinyras\r\nand Adonis.\r\n\r\n[1902] In B. xxxiii. c. 40. According to Aetius, syricum was made\r\nby the calcination of pure ceruse, (similar to the “usta” above\r\nmentioned). He states also that there was no difference between sandyx\r\nand syricum, the former being the term generally used by medical men.\r\n\r\n[1903] “Black colouring substance.”\r\n\r\n[1904] “Carbones infectos.” The reading is very doubtful. It may\r\npossibly mean “charred bones tainted with dirt.” This would make\r\nan inferior ivory-black. The earth before-mentioned is considered\r\nby Ajasson to be a deuto-sulphate of copper, a solution of which,\r\nin gallic acid, is still used for dyeing black. The water near\r\ncopper-mines would very probably be also highly impregnated with it.\r\nBeckmann considers these to have been vitriolic products. Vol. II. p.\r\n265.\r\n\r\n[1905] Our Lamp-black. Vitruvius describes the construction of the\r\nmanufactories above alluded to.\r\n\r\n[1906] Probably, our Chinese, or Indian ink, a different substance from\r\nthe indicum of Chapter 27.\r\n\r\n[1907] From τρύξ, “grape-husks” or “wine-lees.”\r\n\r\n[1908] Indian ink is a composition of fine lamp-black and size.\r\n\r\n[1909] See B. ii. c. 29. Sepia, for sepic drawing, is now prepared from\r\nthese juices.\r\n\r\n[1910] In Chapter 12 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1911] Plate powder. See B. xvii. c. 4, and Chapter 58 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1912] See B. ix. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[1913] See B. ix. c. 65, and B. xxi. cc. 38, 97. According to\r\nVitruvius, it is a colour between scarlet and purple. It may possibly\r\nhave been made from woad.\r\n\r\n[1914] See B. iii. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[1915] See B. xxxiii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1916] White of egg, probably.\r\n\r\n[1917] Indigo, no doubt, is the colour meant. See B. xxxiii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1918] It is the produce of the Indigofera tinctoria, and comes\r\nfrom Bengal more particularly. Beckmann and Dr. Bancroft have each\r\ninvestigated this subject at great length, and though Pliny is greatly\r\nmistaken as to the mode in which the drug was produced, they agree in\r\nthe conclusion that his “indicum” was real indigo, and not, as some\r\nhave supposed, a pigment prepared from _isatis_, or woad.\r\n\r\n[1919] This passage, similar in many respects to the account given by\r\nDioscorides, is commented on at great length by Beckmann, Hist. Inv.\r\nVol. II. p. 263. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1920] See Chapter 56 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1921] See Chapter 30 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1922] “Armenium.” Armenian bole is still used for colouring\r\ntooth-powder and essence of anchovies.\r\n\r\n[1923] See B. xxxiii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[1924] So called, probably, either from the place where it was made,\r\nor from the person who first discovered it. Some commentators have\r\nsuggested that it should be “apian” green, meaning “parsley” colour.\r\n\r\n[1925] So called from “anulus,” a “ring,” as mentioned below.\r\n\r\n[1926] “Quo muliebres picturæ illuminantur.” The meaning of this\r\npassage is obscure. It would seem almost to apply to paintings, but\r\nBeckmann is of opinion that the meaning is, “This is the beautiful\r\nwhite with which the ladies paint or ornament themselves.”—Hist. Inv.\r\nVol. II. p. 261. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[1927] Beckmann suggests that it was so called from its being one of\r\nthe sealing earths, “anulus” being the name of a signet ring. Vol. II.\r\np. 260.\r\n\r\n[1928] “Cretulam.”\r\n\r\n[1929] See B. xxxiii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[1930] See Chapter 39, where this process is more fully described.\r\n“‘_Ceræ_,’ or ‘waxes,’ was the ordinary term for painters’ colours\r\namong the Romans, but more especially encaustic colours, which were\r\nprobably kept dry in boxes, and the wet brush or pencil was rubbed upon\r\nthem when colour was required, or they were moistened by the artist\r\nprevious to commencing work. From the term ‘ceræ’ it would appear that\r\nwax constituted the principal ingredient in the colouring vehicle\r\nused; but this does not necessarily follow, and it is very improbable\r\nthat it did; there must have been a great portion of gum or resin in\r\nthe colours, or they could not have hardened. Wax was undoubtedly a\r\nmost essential ingredient, since it apparently prevents the colours\r\nfrom cracking. ‘Ceræ’ therefore might originally simply mean colours\r\nwhich contained wax, in contradistinction to those which did not;\r\nbut was afterwards applied generally by the Romans to the colours of\r\npainters.”—Wornum, Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art. _Painting_.\r\n\r\n[1931] Called “Inceramenta navium,” in Livy, B. xxviii. c. 45. See also\r\nChapters 39 and 41 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1932] Pliny here commits a mistake, which may have arisen from an\r\nimperfect recollection, as Sir. H. Davy has supposed, of a passage in\r\nCicero (Brutus, c. 18), which, however, quite contradicts the statement\r\nof Pliny. “In painting, we admire in the works of Zeuxis, Polygnotus,\r\nTimanthes, and those who used _four_ colours only, the figure and the\r\nlineaments; but in the works of Echion, Nicomachus, Protogenes, and\r\nApelles, _everything_ is perfect.” Indeed Pliny contradicts himself,\r\nfor he speaks of _two_ other colours used by the earliest painters,\r\nthe _testa trita_, or ground earthenware, in Chapter 5 of this Book;\r\nand “cinnabaris,” or vermilion, in B. xxxiii. c. 36. Also, in Chapter\r\n21 of this Book he speaks of Eretrian earth as having been used by\r\nNicomachus, and in Chapter 25 of ivory black as having been invented by\r\nApelles.\r\n\r\n[1933] These painters will all be noticed in Chapter 36.\r\n\r\n[1934] See Chapter 19 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1935] See B. xxxiii. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[1936] Blue is here excluded altogether, unless under the term\r\n“atramentum” we would include black and blue indicum, or in other\r\nwords, Indian ink and indigo.\r\n\r\n[1937] See Chapter 27 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1938] In allusion to “Dragon’s blood.” See B. xxxiii. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[1939] In Chapter 2 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[1940] From the construction of the passage, it is difficult to say\r\nwhether he means to say that such colossal figures were till then\r\nunknown in painting, or whether that the use of canvass in painting\r\nwas till then unknown. If the latter is the meaning, it is not exactly\r\ncorrect, though it is probable that the introduction of canvass for\r\nthis purpose was comparatively late; there being no mention of its\r\nbeing employed by the Greek painters of the best periods.\r\n\r\n[1941] See B. iii. c. 9, B. xiv. c. 3, and B. xvi. c. 91.\r\n\r\n[1942] “Torcutæ.” For the explanation of this term, see end of B.\r\nxxxiii.\r\n\r\n[1943] In reality he was cousin or nephew of Phidias, by the father’s\r\nside, though Pausanias, B. v. c. 11, falls into the same error as that\r\ncommitted by Pliny. He is mentioned likewise by Strabo and Æschines.\r\n\r\n[1944] See B. xxxvi. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[1945] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1946] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[1947] See B. vii. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[1948] Paintings with but one colour. “Monochromata,” as we shall see\r\nin Chapter 36, were painted at all times, and by the greatest masters.\r\nThose of Zeuxis corresponded with the _Chiariscuri_ of the Italians,\r\nlight and shade being introduced with the highest degree of artistic\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n[1949] These several artists are quite unknown, being mentioned by no\r\nother author.\r\n\r\n[1950] It is pretty clear, from vases of a very ancient date, that\r\nit is not the sexual distinction that is here alluded to. Eumarus,\r\nperhaps, may have been the first to give to each sex its characteristic\r\nstyle of design, in the compositions, draperies, attitudes, and\r\ncomplexions of the respective sexes. Wornum thinks that, probably,\r\nEumarus, and certainly, Cimon, belonged to the class of ancient\r\ntetrachromists, or polychromists, painting in a variety of colours,\r\nwithout a due, or at least a partial, observance of the laws of light\r\nand shade. Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art. _Painting_.\r\n\r\n[1951] He is mentioned also by Ælian. Böttiger is of opinion that he\r\nflourished about the 80th Olympiad. It is probable, however, that he\r\nlived long before the age of Polygnotus; but some time after that of\r\nEumarus. Wornum thinks that he was probably a contemporary of Solon, a\r\ncentury before Polygnotus.\r\n\r\n[1952] “Catagrapha.”\r\n\r\n[1953] This picture was placed in the Pœcile at Athens, and is\r\nmentioned also by Pausanias, B. i. c. 15, and by Æschines, Ctesiph. s.\r\n186.\r\n\r\n[1954] See B. vii. c. 57. (Vol. II. p. 233), where he is mentioned as\r\nan Athenian. It is not improbable that he became a citizen of Athens in\r\nthe seventy-ninth Olympiad, B.C. 463, when Thasos was brought under the\r\npower of Athens, and, as Sillig suggests, at the solicitation of Cimon,\r\nthe son of Miltiades. It is generally supposed that he flourished about\r\nthe eightieth Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[1955] Belonging to the Theatre of Pompey, in the Ninth Region of the\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n[1956] With scenes from the Trojan War, and the adventures of Ulysses.\r\n\r\n[1957] Or “Variegated;” from its various pictures.\r\n\r\n[1958] See B. xxxiii. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[1959] See B. vii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[1960] She is again mentioned in Chapter 40.\r\n\r\n[1961] He was a native of Thasos, and father and instructor of\r\nPolygnotus. As Pliny has already stated that Polygnotus flourished\r\n_before_ the ninetieth Olympiad, there is an inconsistency in his\r\nmaking mention of the son as flourishing before the father. Hence\r\nSillig, with Böttiger, is inclined to think that there were two artists\r\nof this name, one about the seventieth, and the other about the\r\nninetieth Olympiad, the former being the father of Polygnotus.\r\n\r\n[1962] “Primusque gloriam penicillo jure contulit.” Wornum considers\r\nthat “the rich effect of the combination of light and shade with\r\ncolour is clearly expressed in these words.”—Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art.\r\n_Painting_. This artist, who was noted for his arrogance, is mentioned\r\nby other ancient writers.\r\n\r\n[1963] “Penicillus.” This was the hair-pencil or brush, which was used\r\nby one class of painters, in contradistinction to the stylus or cestrum\r\nused for spreading the wax-colours. Painters with the brush used what\r\nwe should term “water-colours;” oil-colours, in our sense of the word,\r\nbeing unknown to the ancients.\r\n\r\n[1964] In “Magna Græcia,” near Crotona, it is supposed. Tzetzes styles\r\nhim as an Ephesian.\r\n\r\n[1965] This is _probably_ the meaning of the words—“Artem ipsis ablatam\r\nZeuxim ferre secum.” It is doubtful whether “ipsis” or “ipsi” is the\r\ncorrect reading.\r\n\r\n[1966] King of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[1967] Μωμήσεταί τις μᾶλλον ἢ μιμήσεται. This line is attributed by\r\nPlutarch to Apollodorus.\r\n\r\n[1968] Cicero and Dionysius of Halicarnassus say that this picture was\r\nexecuted at Crotona, and not at Agrigentum. It is generally supposed to\r\nhave been the painting of Helena, afterwards mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[1969] “Ex albo.” “That is, in grey and grey, similar to the\r\nChiaríscuri of the Italians.”—Wornum, in Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art.\r\n_Painting_.\r\n\r\n[1970] “Figlina opera.” It is not improbable that this may allude to\r\nthe painting of fictile vases.\r\n\r\n[1971] A.U.C. 666. As to this expedition of Fulvius Nobilior, see Livy,\r\nB. xxxviii.\r\n\r\n[1972] Of Philippus Marcius, in the Ninth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1973] In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[1974] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[1975] See end of B. xxxiii. and B. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[1976] The antithesis seems to require here the reading “inexorabilem,”\r\ninstead of “exorabilem.”\r\n\r\n[1977] “Navarchum.”\r\n\r\n[1978] The “Chief of the Galli,” or high priest of Cybele.\r\n\r\n[1979] See end of B. x.\r\n\r\n[1980] Possibly the person mentioned in B. xi. c. 9, or perhaps the\r\nTragic writer of this name, mentioned in the present Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1981] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[1982] “Hoplites.” A runner in panoply, or complete armour, at the\r\nOlympic Games.\r\n\r\n[1983] The “Liver in luxury.” Athenæus, B. xii., confirms this\r\nstatement, and gives some lines which Parrhasius wrote under certain of\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\n[1984] Of Achilles, which were awarded to Ulysses in preference to Ajax.\r\n\r\n[1985] We learn from Suetonius that Tiberius possessed a Meleager and\r\nAtalanta by Parrhasius, of this nature.\r\n\r\n[1986] Said by Eustathius to have been a native of Sicyon, but by\r\nQuintilian, of Cythnos.\r\n\r\n[1987] Cicero, for instance, De Oratore, c. 22, s. 74.\r\n\r\n[1988] Menelaüs.\r\n\r\n[1989] Agamemnon.\r\n\r\n[1990] Built near the Forum, by Vespasian, according to Suetonius.\r\n\r\n[1991] A native of Thebes. A full account of him will be given in the\r\ncourse of this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[1992] Or “Grecian.”\r\n\r\n[1993] He was a native of Amphipolis in Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[1994] Phlius was the chief town of Phliasia, in the north-east of\r\nPeloponnesus. It seems to be quite unknown to what events Pliny here\r\nalludes.\r\n\r\n[1995] Possibly the naval victory gained by the Athenians under\r\nChabrias near Naxos, in the first year of the 101st Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[1996] Which would make the course of study, as M. Ian says, extend\r\nover a period of twelve years.\r\n\r\n[1997] “Graphice;” equivalent, perhaps, to our word “drawing.” “The\r\nelementary process consisted in drawing lines or outlines with the\r\ngraphis, (or stylus) upon tablets of box; the first exercise was\r\nprobably to draw a simple line.”—Wornum, in Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art.\r\n_Painting_.\r\n\r\n[1998] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[1999] Both of whom are mentioned as statuaries, in the early part of\r\nB. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2000] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[2001] The generality of Greek writers represent him as a native either\r\nof Ephesus, or of Colophon.\r\n\r\n[2002] “Venustas.” This word, it has been remarked, will hardly bear a\r\ndefinition. It has been rendered “grace,” “elegance,” “beauty.”\r\n\r\n[2003] “Venerem.” The name of the Goddess of Beauty.\r\n\r\n[2004] “Gracefulness.”\r\n\r\n[2005] “Secuit.” Possibly meaning that he drew another outline in\r\neach of these outlines. The meaning, however, is doubtful, and has\r\noccasioned much trouble to the commentators. Judging from the words\r\nused by Apelles and Protogenes, each in his message, it is not unlikely\r\nthat the “linea” or outline drawn by each was a profile of himself, and\r\nthat the profile of Protogenes was drawn within that of Apelles; who,\r\non the second occasion, drew a third profile between the other two, but\r\nwith a still finer line than either of them. In Dr. Smith’s Dictionary\r\nof Biography, _art._ Apelles, it is thus explained: “The most natural\r\nexplanation of this difficult passage seems to be, that down the middle\r\nof the first line of Apelles, Protogenes drew another, so as to divide\r\nit into two parallel halves, and that Apelles again divided the line of\r\nProtogenes in the same manner.”\r\n\r\n[2006] The Latin form of which, as given by Erasmus, is “Nulla dies\r\nabeat, quin linea ducta supersit.” “Let no day pass by, without an\r\noutline being drawn, and left in remembrance.”\r\n\r\n[2007] “In pergulâ.”\r\n\r\n[2008] “Ne sutor ultra crepidam.” Equivalent to our saying, “Let not\r\nthe shoemaker go beyond his last.”\r\n\r\n[2009] In B. vii. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2010] Also known as “Campaspe,” and “Pacate.” She was the favourite\r\nconcubine of Alexander, and is said to have been his first love.\r\n\r\n[2011] “Venus rising out of the waters.” Athenæus says, B. xiii., that\r\nthe courtesan Phryne was his model, whom, at the festival of Neptune,\r\nhe had seen enter the sea naked at Eleusis.\r\n\r\n[2012] See Matthew xiii. 57; Mark vi. 4. “A prophet is not without\r\nhonour, save in his own country.”\r\n\r\n[2013] “Physiognomists.”\r\n\r\n[2014] “Vocatores”—more literally, his “inviting officers.”\r\n\r\n[2015] Strabo mentions a portrait of Antigonus in the possession of the\r\ninhabitants of Cos.\r\n\r\n[2016] See Note 2011 above. Propertius mentions this as his greatest\r\nwork. B. III. El. 9, l. 11. “In Veneris tabulâ summam sibi ponit\r\nApelles.” “In his picture of Venus, Apelles produces his masterpiece.”\r\nIt is mentioned also by Ovid, Tristia, B. II. l. 527, and Art. Amor. B.\r\nIII. l. 401. The line in B. III. l. 224 is also well known—\r\n\r\n  “Nuda Venus madidas exprimit imbre comas.”\r\n\r\n  “And naked Venus wrings her dripping locks.”\r\n\r\n[2017] In the Forum, in the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2018] His father by adoption.\r\n\r\n[2019] There are several Epigrams descriptive of it in the Greek\r\nAnthology.\r\n\r\n[2020] This, probably, is the meaning of “Tali opere dum laudatur\r\nvicto sed illustrato,” words which have given much trouble to the\r\ncommentators.\r\n\r\n[2021] Nothing further seems to be known of him.\r\n\r\n[2022] “Cois.” The first one was also painted for the people of Cos, by\r\nwhom it was ultimately sold to Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2023] See Chapter 32 of this Book. That this is an erroneous\r\nassertion, has been shown in Note 1932 above.\r\n\r\n[2024] Probably the weight of the panel, frame, and ornamental\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\n[2025] This word was probably a title, meaning “Keeper of the temple.”\r\nStrabo tells us that the “megabyzi,” or as he calls them, the\r\n“megalobyzi,” were eunuch priests in the Temple of Artemis, or Diana,\r\nat Ephesus.\r\n\r\n[2026] The favourite of Alexander, by whom he was afterwards slain.\r\n\r\n[2027] Probably the name of a rich sensualist who lived at Argos. A son\r\nof the Attic orator Lycurgus, one of the sophists, also bore this name.\r\n\r\n[2028] This name is supposed by Sillig to have been inserted\r\nerroneously, either by Pliny, or by his transcribers.\r\n\r\n[2029] Either the Argonaut of that name, who was killed by the\r\nCaledonian Boar, or else, which is the most probable, a King of the\r\nLeleges in Samos, with whom, according to the Scholiast on Apollonius\r\nRhodius, originated the saying, “There is many a slip between the cup\r\nand the lip;” in reference to his death, by a wild boar, when he was\r\nabout to put a cup of wine to his mouth.\r\n\r\n[2030] Shown in his forbearing to appropriate them to his own use.\r\n\r\n[2031] Anna Perenna, probably, a Roman divinity of obscure origin, the\r\nlegends about whom are related in the Fasti of Ovid, B. iii. l. 523.\r\n_et seq._ See also Macrobius, Sat. I. 12. Her sacred grove was near\r\nthe Tiber, but of her temple nothing whatever is known. “Antoniæ” is\r\nanother reading, but no such divinity is mentioned by any other author.\r\n\r\n[2032] Sillig (Dict. Anc. Art.) is of opinion that the reading is\r\ncorrupt here, and that the meaning is, that Apelles “painted a Hero and\r\nLeander.”\r\n\r\n[2033] Or Demigod.\r\n\r\n[2034] One of the followers of Alexander, ultimately slain by Eumenes\r\nin Armenia.\r\n\r\n[2035] King of Macedonia.\r\n\r\n[2036] Odyss. B. vi. l. 102, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2037] Sir Joshua Reynolds discovers in the account here given “an\r\nartist-like description of the effect of glazing, or scumbling, such as\r\nwas practised by Titian and the rest of the Venetian painters.”—_Notes\r\nto Du Fresnoy._\r\n\r\n[2038] “Lapis specularis.” See B. xxxvi. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[2039] He was son of Aristodemus, and brother and pupil of Nicomachus,\r\nin addition to Euxenidas, already mentioned in this Chapter. He,\r\nPausanias, and Nicophanes, excelled, as we learn from Athenæus, B.\r\nxiii., in the portraits of courtesans; hence their name, πορνόγραφοι.\r\n\r\n[2040] It has been well remarked by Wornum, in the article so often\r\nquoted, that “expression of the feelings and passions cannot be denied\r\nto Polygnotus, Apollodorus, Parrhasius, Timanthes, and many others.”\r\n\r\n[2041] See B. iv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[2042] Meaning, “Her who has ceased” to live. The reference is to\r\nByblis, who died of love for her brother Caunus. See Ovid’s Metam. B.\r\nix. l. 455, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2043] Or Bacchus. Already mentioned in Chapter 8 of this Book, in\r\nreference to the Roman general Mummius.\r\n\r\n[2044] In the Eleventh Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2045] In the Tenth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2046] Celebrated on the 3rd of July.\r\n\r\n[2047] In reference to the age of Apelles, whom he is supposed to have\r\nsurvived.\r\n\r\n[2048] In Caria, near to Lycia. Suidas says that he was born at Xanthus\r\nin Lycia.\r\n\r\n[2049] Or Vestibule.\r\n\r\n[2050] Supposed by Sillig to have been an allegorical painting\r\nrepresenting two of the sacred ships of the Athenians; but to have\r\nbeen mistaken in later times for a picture of Ulysses and Nausicaa, a\r\nsubject taken from the Odyssey, B. vi. l. 16, _et seq._ As to Paralus,\r\nsaid to have been the first builder of long ships, or ships of war, see\r\nB. vii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[2051] Or “long ships.”\r\n\r\n[2052] Son of Cercaphus and Cydippe or Lysippe, and grandson of Apollo.\r\nHe is said to have been the founder of the town of Ialysus, mentioned\r\nin B. v. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2053] “These four times most probably were, the dead colouring,\r\na first and a second painting, and lastly, scumbling with\r\nglazing.”—Wornum, Smith’s Dict. Antiq. Art. _Painting_.\r\n\r\n[2054] See Chapter 40 in this Book.\r\n\r\n[2055] “Poppyzonta.” “Smacking with his lips.” Somewhat similar to the\r\ns—s—s—s of our grooms and ostlers.\r\n\r\n[2056] Poliorcetes.\r\n\r\n[2057] “In repose.”\r\n\r\n[2058] Phæstis, or Phæstias by name.\r\n\r\n[2059] In B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2060] A native of Athens, ranked by Plutarch with Euphranor and Nicias.\r\n\r\n[2061] Tyrant of Elaten, mentioned already in this Chapter. See Note 2041.\r\n\r\n[2062] Supposed by Sillig to have been a native of Thebes.\r\n\r\n[2063] Or “Youth;” in the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2064] See B. xiii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2065] A round, closely-fitting skull cap, made of felt. St. Jerome,\r\nEpist. 120, speaks of Ulysses as being thus represented in paintings.\r\nStatues of him with the “pileus” are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2066] See B. ii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2067] A contemporary of Philip of Macedon.\r\n\r\n[2068] A dithyrambic poet, born at Selinus. He flourished B.C. 398.\r\nOnly a few lines of his works remain.\r\n\r\n[2069] “Breviores etiamnum quasdam picturæ compendiarias invenit.”\r\nDelafosse is of opinion that paintings in grotesque are probably meant.\r\n\r\n[2070] His country is uncertain, but he probably lived about the time\r\nof Apelles.\r\n\r\n[2071] In Chapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2072] He belonged, as Wornum remarks, to the class of genre-painters,\r\nor _peintres du genre bas_, as the French term them. His age and\r\ncountry are unknown.\r\n\r\n[2073] “Painter of low subjects.” This term is equivalent in meaning,\r\nprobably, to our expression—“The Dutch style.”\r\n\r\n[2074] “Mæniana.” Balustrades or balconies, said to have been so called\r\nfrom one Mænius, who built them.\r\n\r\n[2075] See Chapter 8 of this Book. They are mentioned also in the\r\n“Curculio” of Plautus, A. iv. s. i. l. 19. Nothing further is known of\r\nSerapio.\r\n\r\n[2076] His country is unknown, but he is supposed to have lived in the\r\nfirst century B.C. See also Chapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2077] “Painter of men.”\r\n\r\n[2078] Mentioned also by Varro. He probably lived in the time of\r\nAlexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[2079] A native of Egypt, compared by many to the most eminent artists.\r\nHe is spoken of in high terms by Quintilian, B. xii. c. 10. See also\r\nChapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2080] Built by Augustus in the Ninth Region of the City, in honour of\r\nhis sister Octavia.\r\n\r\n[2081] See Chapter 36.\r\n\r\n[2082] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[2083] And so caused his death by falling from his chariot. See the\r\n“Hippolytus” of Euripides.\r\n\r\n[2084] Near the Theatre of Pompey, in the Ninth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2085] “Caricatures.” Sillig thinks it not unlikely that Gryllus was\r\npainted with a pig’s face, that animal being signified by the Greek\r\nword γρυλλὸς.\r\n\r\n[2086] See Chapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2087] See Chapter 6 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2088] In the original, as given by Sillig, “Plautiu, Marcus Cleœtas.”\r\nThat commentator supposes him to have been a Greek by birth, and\r\nadopted into the Plautian family, on being made a citizen of Rome.\r\n\r\n[2089] “Euripi.” See B. ii. c. 100, B. viii. c. 40, and B. ix. cc.\r\n22, 80. The landscape paintings on the interior walls of houses at\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii may be taken as specimens of this artist’s\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n[2090] “Succollatis sponsione mulieribus.” This passage appears to be a\r\nmass of confusion, in spite of Sillig’s attempts to amend and explain\r\nit. The meaning can only be guessed at, not given with any degree of\r\ncertainty: of Ludius himself, no further particulars are known.\r\n\r\n[2091] The “hypæthra” or promenades.\r\n\r\n[2092] Most editions give “Famulus.” Nothing further is known of him.\r\n\r\n[2093] See B. xxxvi. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[2094] Both in the First Region of the City, near the Capenian Gate.\r\n\r\n[2095] See Chapter 41 of this Book, where the difficulties attending\r\nthis description will be considered.\r\n\r\n[2096] See Chapter 36 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2097] See Chapter 35 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2098] Possibly the artist of that name mentioned by Athenæus, B.\r\nx., as a tutor of Apelles. If so, he must have flourished about the\r\nninety-seventh Olympiad.\r\n\r\n[2099] Elasippus “inburned” this picture, _i.e._ executed it in\r\nencaustic. From the Attic form of this word, it has been concluded that\r\nhe was an Athenian. The spelling of his name is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[2100] See Chapter 36 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2101] Two paintings of his at Epidaurus are mentioned by Pausanias, B.\r\nii. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[2102] And _not_ in encaustic; though, as we shall see in Chapter 41,\r\nthe brush was sometimes used in this branch.\r\n\r\n[2103] The “One day” picture.\r\n\r\n[2104] See B. xxi. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2105] The “Chaplet-wearer.” See B. xxi. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2106] The “Chaplet-seller.”\r\n\r\n[2107] A “correct” copy.\r\n\r\n[2108] “In confracto.” Meaning probably the group of the surrounding\r\nspectators, on which the shadow of the animal’s body was thrown. It is\r\nevident that this artist excelled in his effect of light and shade,\r\nenhanced by contrasts, and strong foreshortenings.”—Wornum, Smith’s\r\nDict. Antiq. Art. _Painting_.\r\n\r\n[2109] A.U.C. 678. See B. xxxvi. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[2110] Mentioned also in B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2111] Praised by Pausanias, B. i. It was in this combat, he says,\r\nthat Gryllus, the son of Xenophon, and Epaminondas the Theban, first\r\ndistinguished themselves.\r\n\r\n[2112] “Carne.” Beef, according to Plutarch, was the flesh mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2113] The dress of the Greek philosophers, more particularly.\r\n\r\n[2114] Born in the island of Cythnos, one of the Cyclades. He is\r\nsupposed to be the artist mentioned by Theophrastus, De Lapid. c. 95.\r\n\r\n[2115] It is supposed by Sillig, from Dio Cassius, B. liii. c. 27, that\r\nthis painting was transferred by M. Vipsanius Agrippa, to the Portico\r\nof Neptune.\r\n\r\n[2116] See Chapter 20 of this Book, where he is mentioned as having\r\nbeen the first artist who used “usta” or burnt ceruse. From Pausanias\r\nwe learn that his remains were interred at Athens, in the road leading\r\nto the Academia.\r\n\r\n[2117] Chiaroscuro.\r\n\r\n[2118] In Chapter 10 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2119] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[2120] In the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2121] Spoken of by Pausanias, B. iii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2122] In the Forum at Rome.\r\n\r\n[2123] See Chapter 36 of this Book, Note 2025, p. 261.\r\n\r\n[2124] “Place of the prophecies of the dead;” in reference to the\r\ndescription of the Infernal Regions in the Fourth Book of the Odyssey.\r\n\r\n[2125] See Chapter 37 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2126] See B. iv. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[2127] Supposed by Hardouin to be the writer mentioned at the end of B.\r\nvii. and B. x.: or perhaps, “a chief” of an Athenian tribe.\r\n\r\n[2128] A “group of kindred.”\r\n\r\n[2129] A disciple of Carneades. See the list of writers at the end of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[2130] B.C. 168.\r\n\r\n[2131] Represented in a sitting posture, as mentioned by Ovid, Trist.\r\nII. 525, and by Philostratus, Vit. Apol. B. II. c. 10. The Medea is\r\ndescribed in an Epigram in B. iv. of the Greek Anthology, imitated by\r\nAusonius, Epigr. 22.\r\n\r\n[2132] See Note 2116 above.\r\n\r\n[2133] Medusa, slain by Perseus.\r\n\r\n[2134] In the former editions, “Mecophanes.”\r\n\r\n[2135] Or ochre. See B. xxxiii. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[2136] Health, Brightness, and All-heal.\r\n\r\n[2137] Greek for “sluggard.”\r\n\r\n[2138] Probably, from the context, a pupil, also, of Pausias.\r\n\r\n[2139] In pencil painting, and in encaustic.\r\n\r\n[2140] Probably the same painter that is mentioned in Chapter 37.\r\n\r\n[2141] An effect for which Schalken is famous.\r\n\r\n[2142] “Shading his eyes.”\r\n\r\n[2143] Son and pupil of Aglaopho, and brother of Polygnotus. He was\r\nprobably a native of Thasos.\r\n\r\n[2144] See Chapter 36, Note 2029, page 261.\r\n\r\n[2145] “Dolus.” An emblematical picture evidently, probably\r\nrepresenting the events just prior to the capture of Troy.\r\n\r\n[2146] A famous diver, mentioned by Herodotus, B. viii. c. 8,\r\nPausanias, B. x. c. 19, and Strabo, B. ix.\r\n\r\n[2147] Probably the wife of Seleucus, given by him to his son\r\nAntiochus. See B. vii. c. 37, Note 1165.\r\n\r\n[2148] That they should rebuild the walls of Troy.\r\n\r\n[2149] His contest with Corragus the Macedonian, whom he defeated,\r\nis mentioned also by Ælian, Diodorus Siculus, Athenæus, and Quintus\r\nCurtius.\r\n\r\n[2150] Gained “without raising the dust,” _i.e._ without any difficulty.\r\n\r\n[2151] This is perhaps the meaning of “stemmata;” “heraldic pictures,”\r\nprobably. See Juvenal, Sat. viii. l. 2.\r\n\r\n[2152] Suidas seems to mention him, under the name of “Ctesiochus,” as\r\nthe brother of Apelles.\r\n\r\n[2153] Who was said to have been born from the thigh of Jove.\r\n\r\n[2154] Or cap; see Chapter 35 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2155] By Hercules, when he demanded Iole of her father Eurytus, king\r\nof Œchalia.\r\n\r\n[2156] See Note 2147 above.\r\n\r\n[2157] Several Cratini were distinguished as Comic writers, but we do\r\nnot read in any other author of any one of them being a painter. The\r\nreading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[2158] A building at the entrance into Athens, whence the “pompæ,” or\r\nsolemn processions, set out.\r\n\r\n[2159] Hardouin thinks that this was the victory gained by Aratus of\r\nSicyon over Aristippus, the Tyrant of Argos. If so, Leontiscus must\r\nhave flourished about Olymp. 136.\r\n\r\n[2160] Caused by the anger of Juno. In this fit of insanity he slew his\r\nwife Megara and her children.\r\n\r\n[2161] See also Chapter 36. From Plutarch we learn that he was greatly\r\nin favour with Aratus of Sicyon.\r\n\r\n[2162] According to Brotero, a representation of the Ass and Crocodile\r\nwas found in the pictorial embellishments at Herculaneum.\r\n\r\n[2163] See B. xvii. c. 36, B. xviii. c. 56, and B. xix. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[2164] “Theodoras” in most of the editions.\r\n\r\n[2165] See Chapter 36 of this Book, page 252.\r\n\r\n[2166] See the Æneid, B. II. c. 403, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2167] Poliorcetes.\r\n\r\n[2168] A native of Samos, mentioned by Quintilian, B. xii. c. 10,\r\nas one of the painters between the time of Philip and that of the\r\nsuccessors of Alexander.\r\n\r\n[2169] After the murder of his mother.\r\n\r\n[2170] See B. vii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[2171] Or player with the discus.\r\n\r\n[2172] Against his brother Eteocles.\r\n\r\n[2173] Who assisted Polynices in his siege of Thebes.\r\n\r\n[2174] Helen, Castor, and Pollux.\r\n\r\n[2175] See B. vii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[2176] Mentioned in Chapter 36, as having been commenced for the people\r\nof Cos, but never finished.\r\n\r\n[2177] See B. xxxiv. cc. 19, 39. Sillig is of opinion that the picture\r\nmentioned by Pausanias, B. I. c. 1, in honour of Leosthenes, killed in\r\nthe Lamina War, B.C. 323, was by this artist.\r\n\r\n[2178] Poliorcetes, who began to reign B.C. 306.\r\n\r\n[2179] Already mentioned in this Chapter, at greater length.\r\n\r\n[2180] See B. xxxiv. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[2181] See Chapter 36 of this Book, and the present Chapter. Of the\r\ngreater part of these artists nothing further is known.\r\n\r\n[2182] See Chapter 35 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2183] Previously mentioned in this Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2184] Or stylus—“cestrum.”\r\n\r\n[2185] Probably the same painter as the one mentioned in Chapter 37 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[2186] See Chapter 39 of this Book. Pausias painted in wax with the\r\ncestrum.\r\n\r\n[2187] Wornum is of opinion that this must have been a species of\r\ndrawing with a heated point, upon ivory, without the use of wax.\r\nSmith’s Dict. Antiq. Art. _Painting_.\r\n\r\n[2188] This method, as Wornum remarks, though first employed on ships,\r\nwas not necessarily confined to ship-painting; and it must have been\r\na very different style of painting from the ship-colouring of Homer,\r\nsince it was of a later date even than the preceding methods.\r\n\r\n[2189] Though he says nothing here of the use of the “cauterium,” or\r\nprocess of _burning in_, its employment may certainly be inferred\r\nfrom what he has said in Chapter 39. Wornum is of opinion that\r\nthe definition at the beginning of this Chapter, of _two_ methods\r\napparently, “_in_ wax and _on_ ivory,” is in reality an explanation of\r\n_one_ method only, and that the ancient modes of painting in encaustic\r\nwere not only three, but several.\r\n\r\n[2190] Or Temple of the Nymphs. The daughter of Butades is called\r\n“Core” by Athenagoras.\r\n\r\n[2191] See B. xxxiv. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2192] Son of Philæus. He is mentioned by Pausanias, B. viii. c. 14,\r\nand by Herodotus, B. iii. c. 60, as the architect of a fine temple at\r\nSamos, and, with Smilis and Theodorus, of the Labyrinth at Lemnos.\r\n\r\n[2193] Mentioned also in B. xxxiv. c. 19. Pliny is in error here in\r\nusing the word “plastice;” for it was the art of casting brass, and not\r\nthat of making plaster casts, that these artists invented.\r\n\r\n[2194] See Chapter 5 of this Book. He is said by Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassus, B. iii., to have been a member of the family of the\r\nBacchiadæ.\r\n\r\n[2195] A different person, probably, from the one of the same name\r\nmentioned in B. vii. c. 56.\r\n\r\n[2196] Terra cotta figures.\r\n\r\n[2197] See B. xxxiv. c. 19. Tatian mentions a statue of Melanippe by\r\nLysistratus.\r\n\r\n[2198] See B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2199] In the Eleventh Region of the City. This Temple of Ceres,\r\nBacchus, and Proserpine, in the Circus Maximus, was vowed by A.\r\nPosthumius, the Dictator, A.U.C. 258, and dedicated by the consul\r\nCassius, A.U.C. 261, or B.C. 493.\r\n\r\n[2200] See B. xxxiv. c. 16.\r\n\r\n[2201] Sillig (Dict. Anc. Art.) is of opinion that this Chalcosthenes\r\nis not identical with the artist of that name mentioned in B. xxxiv. c.\r\n19; the name “Ceramicus” probably being of far earlier origin than the\r\nformation of the statues of Comedians.\r\n\r\n[2202] “Et.” The insertion of this word seems to militate against\r\nSillig’s position.\r\n\r\n[2203] The “Pottery.”\r\n\r\n[2204] See also B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2205] See Chapter 40 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2206] “Crater.” A vase in which wine and water were mixed for drinking.\r\n\r\n[2207] See B. xxxiii. c. 55, B. xxxvi. c. 4, and end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2208] See B. xxxiii. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2209] In B. viii. c. 4, for instance.\r\n\r\n[2210] The “Hercules fictilis.” It is mentioned by Martial, B. xiv. Ep.\r\n178.\r\n\r\n[2211] See B. xxxiii. c. 2, and B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11.\r\n\r\n[2212] “Simpuvia.”\r\n\r\n[2213] See B. xxxi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[2214] “Mammatis.” The exact meaning of this word is unknown. The\r\npassage is evidently in a corrupt state.\r\n\r\n[2215] As to the Roman “Collegia,” see B. viii. c. 42, and B. xxxiv. c.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[2216] “Solia.”—The same name is given also to a kind of sitting or\r\nreclining-bath, often mentioned by Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2217] Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[2218] See B. iii. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[2219] A service of three dishes.\r\n\r\n[2220] See B. ix. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[2221] See B. ix. cc. 24, 28, 74, 79.\r\n\r\n[2222] In B. x. c. 72.\r\n\r\n[2223] See Note 2211 above.\r\n\r\n[2224] See B. xxiii. c. 47, and the end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2225] Martial speaks of this practice, B. iii. Epigr. 81.\r\n\r\n[2226] Nothing further seems to be known of this personage, or of the\r\ngrounds of his invective. Pliny may possibly allude to some abominable\r\npractices, with which Vitellius is charged by Suetonius also.\r\n\r\n[2227] The “Opus Signinum” was a plaster or cement much used for making\r\npavements. It took its name from Signia, in Italy, celebrated for its\r\ntiles. See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2228] The floors of the Roman houses were seldom boarded.\r\n\r\n[2229] “Pulvis.” See B. iii. c. 9, B. xvi. c. 76, and B. xxxvi. c.\r\n14. He alludes to the cement made of volcanic ashes, now known as\r\n“Pozzuolane.”\r\n\r\n[2230] See B. iv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2231] It being the practice to rub the bodies of the athletes with\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[2232] This circumstance is mentioned also by Suetonius, in his life of\r\nNero. Patrobius was slain by order of the Emperor Galba.\r\n\r\n[2233] Ajasson says that they are called _tapias_ at the present day in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\n[2234] See B. ii. c. 73.\r\n\r\n[2235] “Rubrica.”\r\n\r\n[2236] See B. xxxi. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[2237] Which was, as a measure, nearly three inches in breadth. See\r\nIntroduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[2238] See B. v. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[2239] Ajasson says that these bricks have been imitated by Fabroni,\r\nwith a light argillaceous earth, found in the territory of Sienna.\r\nDelafosse thinks that a place called “Cala,” in the Sierra Morena,\r\nprobably marks the site of the cities above mentioned.\r\n\r\n[2240] See B. iv. c. 5, and B. xxxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2241] “Gerusia.”\r\n\r\n[2242] See B. iii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2243] In B. iii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2244] See B. xviii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2245] “Untouched by fire.” Native sulphur.\r\n\r\n[2246] “Gleba.”\r\n\r\n[2247] Sulphur has been always considered highly useful for the cure of\r\ncutaneous affections.\r\n\r\n[2248] From ἅρπαζω, “to carry away.”\r\n\r\n[2249] Ovid, in his “Art of Love,” speaks of purifying houses with eggs\r\nand sulphur.\r\n\r\n[2250] See B. xxxi. c. 32.\r\n\r\n[2251] There are three distinct kinds of bitumen. 1. Naphtha, also\r\nknown as petroleum, or rock-oil, inflammable, volatile, soluble in\r\nalcohol, and found in France and Italy. 2. Asphalt, or bitumen of\r\nJudæa, solid, insoluble in alcohol, and found in Lake Asphaltites in\r\nSyria, more particularly. 3. Pissasphalt, of a medium consistency\r\nbetween the other substances, of which it appears to be composed. See\r\nB. xxiv. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2252] In B. v. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[2253] Naphtha, most probably.\r\n\r\n[2254] See B. xxiv. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2255] Chapter 109.\r\n\r\n[2256] As to the “nitrum” of Pliny, see B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2257] “Asphalt plaster,” probably.\r\n\r\n[2258] Or mint. See B. xix. c. 47, and B. xx. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[2259] See B. xxxii. c. 13.\r\n\r\n[2260] In B. xxxiv. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2261] Beckmann is of opinion that our _alum_ was not known to the\r\nGreeks or Romans, and that what the latter called “alumen” was green\r\nvitriol, or sulphate of the protoxide of iron, in an impure state.\r\nHist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 180. _Bohn’s Edition._ Dr. Pereira remarks,\r\nhowever, that “there can be little doubt that Pliny was acquainted\r\nwith our alum, but did not distinguish it from sulphate of iron, for\r\nhe informs us that one kind of alum was white, and was used for dyeing\r\nwool of bright colours.” Materia Medica, Vol. I, Delafosse identifies\r\nthe “alumen” of Pliny with double sulphate of alum and iron.\r\n\r\n[2262] “Salsugo terræ.”\r\n\r\n[2263] See Note 2261 above.\r\n\r\n[2264] For gilding, Hardouin says.\r\n\r\n[2265] The Roman provinces in Africa, other than Egypt.\r\n\r\n[2266] Now Strombolo. See B. iii. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[2267] Herodotus, B. ii., mentions the fact that King Amasis sent\r\nthe people of Delphi a thousand talents of this substance, as his\r\ncontribution towards rebuilding their temple.\r\n\r\n[2268] “Fruitful,” or “useful.”\r\n\r\n[2269] “Adulterated.”\r\n\r\n[2270] See B. xx. c. 71.\r\n\r\n[2271] “Split” alum. Probably iron alum, the French _alum de plume_; of\r\na flaky, silky appearance.\r\n\r\n[2272] “Hairy alum.”\r\n\r\n[2273] See B. xxxiv. cc. 2, 29.\r\n\r\n[2274] So called, according to Dioscorides, from the “round” form of\r\nthe pieces.\r\n\r\n[2275] He has previously said that the most esteemed kind was the\r\nEgyptian, that of Melos being the next best.\r\n\r\n[2276] Στυπτηρία, the “styptic.”\r\n\r\n[2277] “Sero picis.” Hardouin is of opinion that under this name\r\npisselæon is intended. See B. xv. c. 7, B. xxiv. cc. 11, 24, and B.\r\nxxv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2278] At the beginning of this Chapter in part.\r\n\r\n[2279] Aluminous silicates, as Delafosse remarks, more or less combined\r\nwith other minerals. Though employed for various purposes in the arts,\r\nthey are now but little used in medicine.\r\n\r\n[2280] Probably because it was the more extensively employed of the\r\ntwo, in “collyria,” or compositions for the eyes.\r\n\r\n[2281] “Star” earth, apparently.\r\n\r\n[2282] From Eretria, in Eubœa. See B. iv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2283] In Chapter 21 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2284] It appears to be a matter of doubt whether it was found at\r\nSelinus, in Sicily, or the place of that name in Cilicia. See B. iii.\r\nc. 14, and B. v. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2285] Agricola is of opinion that this earth had its name from the\r\nplace called Pnigeum, in the Libyan Mareotis. Other commentators would\r\nhave it to be derived from πνίγω, “to suffocate,” such being\r\nits effect if taken internally.\r\n\r\n[2286] See the next Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2287] So called from ἀμπέλος, a “vine;” either because it was\r\napplied to vines to kill the insects, or because its admixture with the\r\nsoil was favourable to the cultivation of the vine.\r\n\r\n[2288] “Washes for beautifying the eye-brows.” See B. xxi. c. 73, B.\r\nxxiii. c. 51, and B. xxxiii. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[2289] Cimolian earth, known in modern chemistry as Cimolite, is not\r\na cretaceous earth, but an aluminous silicate, still found in the\r\nisland of Kimoli, or Argentiera, one of the Cyclades; See B. iv. c. 23.\r\nTournefort describes it as a white chalk, very heavy, tasteless, and\r\ndissolving in water. It is found also at Alexandrowsk in Russia.\r\n\r\n[2290] See Chapter 25 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2291] See B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2292] See B. xii. c. 51.\r\n\r\n[2293] See B. v. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[2294] Beckmann thinks that this may have been our common chalk. Vol.\r\nII. p. 105.\r\n\r\n[2295] This _seems_ to be the meaning of “crescit in macerando.”\r\n\r\n[2296] A.U.C. 535, it is supposed.\r\n\r\n[2297] As a plebiscitum.\r\n\r\n[2298] “Desquamatur.” This is most probably the meaning of the word,\r\nthough Beckmann observes “that it was undoubtedly a term of art, which\r\ncannot be further explained, because we are unacquainted with the\r\noperation to which it alludes.”—Vol II. p. 104. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2299] “Funditur sulphure.” The meaning of these words is very\r\ndoubtful. Beckmann proposes to read “offenditur,” but he is not\r\nsupported by any of the MSS. He has evidently mistaken the meaning of\r\nthe whole passage.\r\n\r\n[2300] Probably because it was too calcareous, Beckmann thinks.\r\n\r\n[2301] See B. iv. c. 3, and B. xxxvi. c. 59.\r\n\r\n[2302] Plate powder; from “argentum,” “silver.” See B. xvii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2303] Whitening, or chalk washed and prepared, is still used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[2304] The goal for the chariots.\r\n\r\n[2305] This reading is restored by Sillig from the Bamberg MS., but\r\nno particulars are known relative to the person alluded to; unless,\r\nindeed, as Sillig suspects to be the case, he is identical with Publius\r\nSyrus, the writer of mimes, mentioned in B. viii. c. 77.\r\n\r\n[2306] Supposed by some to have been the Manilius who was author\r\nof the poem called “Astronomica,” still in existence. It is more\r\nprobable, however, that he was the father of the poet, or perhaps the\r\ngrandfather; as it is clear from a passage in Suetonius, that Staberius\r\nEros taught at Rome during the civil wars of Sylla, while the poem must\r\nhave been written, in part at least, after the death of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2307] Being afterwards manumitted. Sillig thinks that they may have\r\narrived in Rome about B.C. 90.\r\n\r\n[2308] “Catasta.” A raised platform of wood on which the slaves were\r\nexposed for sale.\r\n\r\n[2309] “Rectorem.” For an explanation of this allusion, see B. xxviii.\r\nc. 14.\r\n\r\n[2310] A native of Gadara in Syria, according to Josephus. Seneca\r\nspeaks of him as being more wealthy than his master.\r\n\r\n[2311] Or Menodorus, who deserted Sextus Pompeius and went over to\r\nOctavianus.\r\n\r\n[2312] Who remained faithful to Pompeius, and died in his cause.\r\n\r\n[2313] He is probably speaking in reference to her paramour, the\r\nfreedman Pallas. See B. xxxiii. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2314] As to the earths of Galata and Clypea, see B. v. c. 7. The\r\nothers are mentioned in B. iii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2315] See end of B. ix.\r\n\r\n[2316] See end of B. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[2317] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2318] See end of Books vii. and xiv.\r\n\r\n[2319] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2320] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2321] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2322] See end of B. x.\r\n\r\n[2323] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2324] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2325] See end of B. xvi.\r\n\r\n[2326] A native of Longula in Latium. Though of dissolute character,\r\nhe was famous as an orator and satirical writer. It was he who accused\r\nNonius Asprenas of poisoning, as mentioned in Chapter 46 of this Book.\r\nHe died in exile at the island of Seriphos, about A.D. 33. His works\r\nwere at first proscribed, but were afterwards permitted by Caligula to\r\nbe read.\r\n\r\n[2327] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2328] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2329] The painter, mentioned at great length in Chapter 36 of this\r\nBook, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[2330] A painter of Sicyon, mentioned in Chapters 32 and 36 of this\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2331] Probably the painter of that name, mentioned in Chapter 36 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[2332] The artist mentioned in B. xxxiv. c. 19, and in Chapter 40 of\r\nthe present Book.\r\n\r\n[2333] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2334] Possibly the painter of that name, mentioned in Chapter 40 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[2335] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2336] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2337] See end of B. xxx.\r\n\r\n[2338] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2339] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2340] See end of Books iv., viii., xi., and xx.\r\n\r\n[2341] See end of B. xx.\r\n\r\n[2342] See end of Books iv. and xii.\r\n\r\n[2343] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2344] See end of B. xiii.\r\n\r\n[2345] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2346] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2347] See end of B. xxix.\r\n\r\n[2348] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2349] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2350] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2351] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2352] See B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11.\r\n\r\n[2353] See the lines of Juvenal, Sat. x. l. 151, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2354] He alludes to vessels made of crystal, which, as Dalechamps\r\nremarks, was long supposed to be nothing but ice in a concrete form.\r\nSee B. xxxvii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2355] See B. viii. c. 82.\r\n\r\n[2356] “Glandia.”\r\n\r\n[2357] See Chapter 24 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2358] See Chapter 8 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2359] In the Eleventh Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2360] See B. xxxv. cc. 43, 45.\r\n\r\n[2361] See B. xvii. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[2362] These two artists are invariably mentioned together. Pausanias,\r\nB. ii. c. 14, and B. iii. c. 17, speaks or them as the pupils or sons\r\nof Dædalus; only intimating thereby, as Sillig thinks, that they were\r\nthe first sculptors worthy of being associated with the father of\r\nartists. Pausanias, B. ii. c. 22, mentions ebony statues by them.\r\n\r\n[2363] In the time of the Telchines, before the arrival of Inachus in\r\nArgolis.\r\n\r\n[2364] Pausanias says that this statue was completed by their pupils.\r\nClemens Alexandrinus mentions other works of theirs.\r\n\r\n[2365] Another reading is “Anthermus.” Of many of these sculptors, no\r\nfurther particulars are known.\r\n\r\n[2366] Another cause of the quarrel is said to have been the refusal of\r\nBupalus to give his daughter in marriage to Hipponax. This quarrel is\r\nreferred to in the Greek Anthology, B. iii. Epigr. 26.\r\n\r\n[2367] See B. xiv. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2368] See B. iv. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[2369] Dedicated by Augustus, in the Tenth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2370] Λύχνος being the Greek for a “lamp.”\r\n\r\n[2371] See B. iii. c. 8: now known as the marble of Massa and Carrara,\r\nof a bluish white, and a very fine grain.\r\n\r\n[2372] A similar case has been cited, in the figure of St. Jerome, to\r\nbe seen on a stone in the Grotto of Our Saviour at Bethlehem, and in\r\na representation of the Crucifixion, in the Church of St. George, at\r\nVenice. A miniature resembling that of the poet Chaucer is to be seen\r\non the surface of a small stone in the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[2373] See B. xxxv. c. 44.\r\n\r\n[2374] See B. xxxv. cc. 37, 40.\r\n\r\n[2375] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2376] “In the Gardens.” A suburb of Athens, in which there was a\r\ntemple of Venus, or Aphrodite Urania.\r\n\r\n[2377] He is mentioned also by Pausanias and Strabo.\r\n\r\n[2378] The Goddess of Retribution. Pausanias, B. i. c. 33, says that\r\nit was the work of Phidias, and that it was made of Parian marble,\r\nwhich the Persians had brought into Attica for the purpose of erecting\r\na trophy. Strabo, however, in B. ix., says that it was the work of\r\nAgoracritus and Diodotus (an artist otherwise unknown), and that it\r\nwas not at all inferior to the production of Phidias. Tzetzes again,\r\nSuidas, and Photius, say that it was the work of Phidias, and that\r\nit was presented by him to his favourite pupil, Agoracritus. Sillig\r\nrejects the story of the contest, and the decision by the suffrages of\r\nthe Athenian people. Some modern writers have doubted also, whether a\r\nstatue of Venus could be modified so as to represent Nemesis; but not\r\nwith sufficient reason, Sillig thinks.\r\n\r\n[2379] See B. iv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2380] A statue, Sillig supposes, of the goddess Cybele.\r\n\r\n[2381] “Pandoras Genesis.”\r\n\r\n[2382] Sillig is of opinion that this passage is corrupt, and is\r\ninclined to think, with Panofka, that the reading should be “nascenti\r\nadstantes,”—gods “standing by the new-born” Pandora.\r\n\r\n[2383] In B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2384] See B. xxxv. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[2385] “Velatâ specie.” There has been much discussion about the\r\nmeaning of these words; and Sillig is of opinion that the figure was\r\nrepresented draped in a garment, which, while it seemed designed to\r\nhide the person, really exposed it to view. This dress would not\r\nimprobably recommend it additionally to the inhabitants of Cos, who\r\nwere skilled in making the _Coæ vestes_, garments which, while they\r\ncovered the body, revealed its naked charms. See further mention of\r\nthem in B. ix. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[2386] Visconti thinks that a statue still preserved in the Royal\r\nMuseum at Paris, is a copy of the Coan Venus. It has, however, a figure\r\nof Cupid associated with it, which, as Sillig observes, militates\r\nagainst the supposition.\r\n\r\n[2387] The ancient writers abound in praises of this wonderful statue.\r\nLucian, however, has given the most complete and artistic description\r\nof it. It was supposed by the ancients, to represent Venus as standing\r\nbefore Paris, when he awarded to her the prize of beauty; but it has\r\nbeen well remarked, that the drapery in the right hand, and the vase\r\nby the side of the figure, indicate that she has either just left or\r\nis about to enter the bath. The artist modelled it from Phryne, a\r\ncourtesan or hetæra of Athens, of whom he was greatly enamoured. It was\r\nultimately carried to Constantinople, where it perished by fire in the\r\nreign of Justinian. It is doubtful whether there are any copies of it\r\nin existence. There is, however, a so-called copy in the gardens of the\r\nVatican, and another in the Glyptothek, at Munich. A Venus in the Museo\r\nPio-Clementino, at Rome, is considered by Visconti and others to have\r\nbeen a copy of the Cnidian Venus, with the addition of drapery. It is\r\nsupposed that Cleomenes, in making the Venus de Medici, imitated the\r\nCnidian Venus in some degree.\r\n\r\n[2388] There are numerous Epigrams in reference to this statue in\r\nthe Greek Anthology; the most striking line in any of which is the\r\nbeautiful Pentameter:\r\n\r\n  Φεῦ! φεῦ! ποῦ γυμνὴν εἶδε με Πραξιτέλης;\r\n\r\n  “Alas! where has Praxiteles me naked seen?”\r\n\r\n[2389] Lucian, Valerius Maximus, and Athenæus, tell the same improbable\r\nstory, borrowing it from Posidippus the historian.\r\n\r\n[2390] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[2391] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2392] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2393] Pliny is mistaken here: for in the time of Cicero, as we find\r\nin Verr. 4, 2, 4, the Thespian Cupid was still at Thespiæ, in Bœotia,\r\nwhere it had been dedicated by Phryne, and was not removed to Rome till\r\nthe time of the emperors. It was the Parian Cupid, originally made for\r\nthe people of Parium, that, after coming into the possession of Heius,\r\na rich Sicilian, was forcibly taken from him by Verres.\r\n\r\n[2394] Where it was destroyed by fire in the reign of Titus. See B.\r\nxxxiv. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[2395] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2396] Frantic Bacchantes.\r\n\r\n[2397] Sacrificing Bacchantes.\r\n\r\n[2398] The name given in architecture to figures of females employed\r\nas columns in edifices. The Spartans, on taking the city of Carya, in\r\nLaconia, massacred the male inhabitants, and condemned the females to\r\nthe most bitter servitude, as “hewers of wood and drawers of water.”\r\nHence the memorials of their servitude thus perpetuated in architecture.\r\n\r\n[2399] Or companions of Bacchus. See B. xxxv. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2400] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2401] “Symplegma.”\r\n\r\n[2402] Also mentioned in B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2403] Pausanias, B. I., speaks of _three_ figures sculptured by\r\nScopas; Erôs, Himeros, and Pothos. It is doubtful, however, whether\r\nthey are identical with those here spoken of.\r\n\r\n[2404] Or “Desire.” The name of “Phaëthon” is added in most of the\r\neditions, but Sillig rejects it as either a gloss, or a corruption of\r\nsome other name.\r\n\r\n[2405] “Campteras.” This, which is probably the true reading, has been\r\nrestored by Sillig from the Bamberg MS. The καμπτὴρ was the\r\nbend or turning, round the goal in the race-course for chariots; and\r\nas Vesta was symbolical of the earth, these figures, Sillig thinks,\r\nprobably represented the poles, as goals of the sun’s course.\r\n\r\n[2406] Figures of Virgins, carrying on their heads baskets filled with\r\nobjects consecrated to Minerva.\r\n\r\n[2407] Dedicated to Neptune by Cneius Domitius Ahenobarbus, in the\r\nNinth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2408] “Et” appears a preferable reading to the “aut” of the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[2409] “Hippocampi.” It is pretty clear that by this name he cannot\r\nmean the small fish so called in B. xxxii. cc. 20, 23, 27, 30, 35, 38,\r\n50, and 53, and alluded to in B. ix. c. 1; the Syngnathus hippocampus\r\nof Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[2410] A sea-divinity.\r\n\r\n[2411] “Pistrices.” See B. ix. cc. 2, 3, 15.\r\n\r\n[2412] Conqueror of Callæcia. See B. iv. c. 35. This temple was\r\ndedicated to Mars.\r\n\r\n[2413] A statue of Apollo, Hardouin thinks, which was originally\r\nbrought from Seleucia by C. Sosius, the quæstor of M. Lepidus. See B.\r\nxiii. c. 5.\r\n\r\n[2414] Ajasson says that this work is identical with the group\r\nrepresenting Niobe and her children, now at Florence. It was found in\r\n1535, or, as some say, 1583, near the Lateran Gate at Rome; upon which,\r\nit was bought by Ferdinand de Medici, and placed in the park of one of\r\nhis villas. More recently, the Emperor Leopold purchased it, and had it\r\nremoved to Florence.\r\n\r\n[2415] The Temple of Janus, in the Eighth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2416] Probably by neither of them, as Janus was essentially an Italian\r\nDivinity. See Ovid’s Fasti, B. I.\r\n\r\n[2417] See B. xxxv. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[2418] A large upper garment, reaching to the ankles.\r\n\r\n[2419] Both Liber and Libera were originally Italian Divinities,\r\nwho presided over the vine and the fields. Pliny, however, always\r\nidentifies the former with Bacchus, and other writers the latter with\r\nPersephone, or Proserpina, the daughter of Demeter or Ceres. Ovid,\r\nFasti, B. iii. l. 512, calls Ariadne, “Libera.”\r\n\r\n[2420] See B. xvi. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[2421] A disciple of Marsyas, and a famous player on the flute. See p.\r\n319.\r\n\r\n[2422] All these figures have been found copied in the frescoes of\r\nHerculaneum.\r\n\r\n[2423] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2424] It is doubtful whether this is the same artist that is mentioned\r\nin B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2425] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2426] Hence, too, the use of the word “Mausoleum,” as meaning a\r\nsplendid tomb.\r\n\r\n[2427] He means, probably, the extent of the colonnade or screen which\r\nsurrounded it. The Mausoleum was erected at Halicarnassus.\r\n\r\n[2428] Facing east and west.\r\n\r\n[2429] Or “wing.” The “ptera,” or “pteromata,” properly speaking, were\r\nthe two wings at the sides of a building. See Note 2431 below.\r\n\r\n[2430] She only survived her husband two years.\r\n\r\n[2431] Another reading, and perhaps a preferable one, is “one hundred”\r\nfeet. The account given by Pliny is very confused, and Littré has\r\ntaken some pains to explain the construction of this building. He is\r\nof opinion that in the first place, a quadrangular main building was\r\nerected, 63 feet in length on the north and south, the breadth of the\r\neast and west faces being shorter, some 42 feet perhaps. Secondly, that\r\nthere was a screen of 36 columns surrounding the main building, and 411\r\nfeet in circumference. (He adopts this reading in preference to the\r\n440 feet of the Bamberg MS.) That the longer sides of this screen were\r\n113.25 feet in extent, and the shorter 92.125 feet. That between the\r\nmain building and this screen, or colonnade, there was an interval of\r\n25.125 feet. Thirdly, that the colonnade and the main buildings were\r\nunited by a vaulted roof, and that this union formed the “Pteron.”\r\nFourthly, that rising from this Pteron, there was a quadrangular\r\ntruncated pyramid, formed of twenty-four steps, and surmounted with a\r\nchariot of marble. This would allow, speaking in round numbers, 37½\r\nfeet for the height of the main body of the building, 37½ feet for\r\nthe pyramid, and twenty-five feet for the height of the chariot and the\r\nfigure which it doubtless contained.\r\n\r\n[2432] Supposed to be the person alluded to by Horace, 1 Sat. 3, 90.\r\n\r\n[2433] He is mentioned also by Tatian, and is supposed to have lived\r\nabout the time of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\n[2434] “Charites.”\r\n\r\n[2435] “Porch,” or “Vestibule” of the Citadel at Athens.\r\n\r\n[2436] Mentioned in B. xxxv. c. 40. The present Socrates is identified\r\nby Pausanias, B. i. c. 22, and B. ix. c. 25, and by Diogenes Laertius,\r\nB. ii. c. 19, with the great Athenian philosopher of that name, son of\r\nthe statuary Sophroniscus: but the question as to his identity is very\r\ndoubtful. Diogenes Laertius adds, that whereas artists had previously\r\nrepresented the Graces naked, Socrates sculptured them with drapery.\r\n\r\n[2437] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2438] See B. xxxv. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[2439] Or Muses of Thespiæ, in Bœotia.\r\n\r\n[2440] There have been several distinguished sculptors, all of this\r\nname. A statuary, son of Apollodorus the Athenian, made the celebrated\r\nVenus de Medici. It is the opinion of Visconti and Thiersch, that the\r\nartist here mentioned flourished before the destruction of Corinth.\r\n\r\n[2441] This name is doubtful, and nothing is known relative to the\r\nartist.\r\n\r\n[2442] “Hippiades” is the old reading, which Dalechamps considers to\r\nmean “Amazons.” The Appiades were Nymphs of the Appian Spring, near the\r\ntemple of Venus Genetrix, in the Forum of Julius Cæsar. See Ovid, Art.\r\nAm. B. i. l. 81, and B. iii. l. 451; and Rem. Am. l. 659.\r\n\r\n[2443] From an inscription on a statue still extant, he is supposed to\r\nhave been a pupil of Pasiteles, and consequently to have flourished\r\nabout B.C. 25.\r\n\r\n[2444] Figures in which the form and attributes of Hermes, or Mercury,\r\nand Eros, or Cupid, were combined, Hardouin thinks.\r\n\r\n[2445] In B. xxxiii. c. 55.\r\n\r\n[2446] In Caria: see B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2447] Or “Xenias”—“Presiding over hospitality,” or “Protector of\r\nstrangers.”\r\n\r\n[2448] The story was, that Zethus and Amphion bound Dirce, queen of\r\nThebes, to the flanks of an infuriated bull, in revenge for the death\r\nof their mother, Antiope, who had been similarly slain by her. This\r\ngroup is supposed still to exist, in part, in the “Farnese Bull,”\r\nwhich has been in a great measure restored. Winckelmann is of opinion,\r\nhowever, that the Farnese Bull is of anterior date to that here\r\nmentioned, and that it belongs to the school of Lysippus.\r\n\r\n[2449] Probably a native of Rhodes. No further particulars of this\r\nartist appear to be known.\r\n\r\n[2450] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[2451] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2452] A different person, probably, from the painter, mentioned in B.\r\nxxxv. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[2453] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2454] Supposed by Sillig not to be the early statuary of Argos of that\r\nname, who flourished, probably, B.C. 476.\r\n\r\n[2455] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2456] “Pasiteles” would appear to be a preferable reading; for Pliny\r\nwould surely have devoted more space to a description of these works of\r\nPraxiteles.\r\n\r\n[2457] The same artist that is previously mentioned, Sillig thinks.\r\n\r\n[2458] Of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n[2459] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2460] “Symplegma.” See Note 2401, page 314.\r\n\r\n[2461] The first being in a stooping posture, washing herself.\r\n\r\n[2462] In B. xxxiii. c. 55, and B. xxxiv. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[2463] A sculptor of the age of Alexander the Great. He is also\r\nmentioned by Tatian. For an account of Callisthenes, see end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2464] Winckelmann supposes that these artists lived in the time of\r\nLysippus; but, as may be discovered from an attentive examination\r\nof the present passage, Lessing and Thiersch are probably right in\r\nconsidering them to have been contemporaries of the Emperor Titus. This\r\ngroup is generally supposed to have been identical with the Laocoön\r\nstill to be seen in the Court of the Belvedere, in the Vatican at\r\nRome; having been found, in 1506, in a vault beneath the spot known\r\nas the Place _de Sette Sale_, by Felix de Fredi, who surrendered it,\r\nin consideration of a pension, to Pope Julius II. The group, however,\r\nis not made of a _single_ block, which has caused some to doubt its\r\nidentity: but it is not improbable, that when originally made, its\r\njoints were not perceptible to a common observer. The spot, too, where\r\nit was found was actually part of the palace of Titus. It is most\r\nprobable that the artists had the beautiful episode of Laocoön in view,\r\nas penned by Virgil, Æn. B. II.; though Ajasson doubts whether they\r\nderived any inspiration from it. Laocoön, in the sublime expression of\r\nhis countenance, is doing any thing, he says, but—\r\n\r\n  “Clamores simul horrendos ad sidera tollit.”\r\n\r\n  “Sending dire outcries to the stars of heaven.”\r\n\r\n[2465] This was an ancient and hideous idol, probably. Plato, Diodorus\r\nSiculus, Plautus, Lactantius, Arnobius, and Isidorus, all concur\r\nin saying that it was Saturn in honour of whom human victims were\r\nimmolated.\r\n\r\n[2466] “Ad Nationes.” A portico built by Augustus, and adorned with\r\nstatues representing various nations.\r\n\r\n[2467] “Thespiades.” They were brought by Mummius from Thespiæ, in\r\nBœotia. See B. xxxiv. c. 19, and Note 2439, above.\r\n\r\n[2468] See B. xxxv. c. 45, and end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2469] Magna Græcia.\r\n\r\n[2470] Built by Metellus Macedonicus.\r\n\r\n[2471] “Navalia.” This was the name of certain docks at Rome, where\r\nships were built, laid up, and refitted. They were attached to the\r\nEmporium, without the Trigeminian Gate, and were connected with the\r\nTiber.\r\n\r\n[2472] See B. xxxv. c. 45.\r\n\r\n[2473] In the Ninth Region of the City. These figures are mentioned\r\nalso by Suetonius, C. 46.\r\n\r\n[2474] See B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2475] A singular combination of names, as they mean “Lizard” and\r\n“Frog.” No further particulars of these artists are known, but they\r\nappear to have lived in the time of Pompey.\r\n\r\n[2476] Of Juno and Apollo.\r\n\r\n[2477] “Spiræ.” See Chapter 56 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2478] Winckelmann, in Vol. II. p. 269, of the _Monumenti Antichi\r\nined._, gives the chapiter of an Ionic column, belonging to the church\r\nof San Lorenzo, without the walls, at Rome, on the volutes of which are\r\nrepresented a frog and a lizard.\r\n\r\n[2479] The old reading is adopted here, in preference to that of the\r\nBamberg MS., which does not appear reconcileable to sense in saying\r\nthat _this_ temple of Jupiter was originally made in honour of Juno;\r\nfor in _such case_ there could be no mistake in introducing the emblems\r\nof female worship.\r\n\r\n[2480] A sculptor of Miletus. See B. vii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2481] A Lacedæmonian artist. See B. vii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2482] As well as that of Paros.\r\n\r\n[2483] Only completed in the time of the Emperor Adrian.\r\n\r\n[2484] Cebriones, the charioteer of Hector. See Il. B. xvi. l. 735.\r\n\r\n[2485] See B. xxxiii. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2486] This is generally explained as meaning ordinary stone, but\r\ncovered with elaborate paintings, as was then the practice in the\r\nmagnificent villas that were built at Tibur, the modern Tivoli. See,\r\nhowever, Chapter 48, and Note 2784.\r\n\r\n[2487] As applied to the decorations of the walls of houses.\r\n\r\n[2488] This date does not agree with that given to Scopas, one of the\r\nartists who worked at the Mausoleum, in the early part of B. xxxiv. c.\r\n19. Sillig, however, is inclined to think that there were _two_ artists\r\nnamed Scopas, and would thus account for the diversity of about seventy\r\nyears between the dates.\r\n\r\n[2489] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2490] Owing to the liberality of Cæsar, he amassed great riches. He\r\nis repeatedly attacked by Catullus (Carm. xxix., xliii., lvii.), and\r\naccused of extortion, and other vices. Horace also speaks of him in\r\nterms of ridicule, I Sat. 5, 37.\r\n\r\n[2491] See B. iv. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2492] See Chapter 4 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2493] The black marbles, Ajasson remarks, are comparatively rare. He\r\nis of opinion that the colour of the Lucullan marble was the _noir\r\nantique_ of the French, and says that it is to be found at Bergamo,\r\nCarrara, Prato in Tuscany, and near Spa in Belgium.\r\n\r\n[2494] “Chios” is another reading.\r\n\r\n[2495] “Thundering Jupiter.” This temple was built by Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2496] Ajasson says that his remarks on the choice of the sand for this\r\npurpose, are very judicious.\r\n\r\n[2497] A recommendation worse than useless, Ajasson remarks.\r\n\r\n[2498] For this purpose, at the present day, granular corindon, or\r\nyellow emery, is used, as also a mixture composed of the oxides of lead\r\nand of tin; the substance being repeatedly moistened when applied.\r\n\r\n[2499] See Chapters 13 and 43 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2500] A city in Crete where the stone was prepared for use.\r\n\r\n[2501] “Cotes.”\r\n\r\n[2502] Books III. IV. V. and VI.\r\n\r\n[2503] The modern Ophite, both Noble, Serpentine, and Common.\r\n\r\n[2504] From the Greek ὄφις, a “serpent.”\r\n\r\n[2505] This would appear to be a kind of Apatite, or Augustite, found\r\nin crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\n[2506] A superstition, owing solely to the name and appearance of the\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n[2507] From the Greek τέφρα, “ashes.” The _modern_ Tephroite\r\nis a silicate of manganese.\r\n\r\n[2508] Memphis, in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[2509] A variety of the modern Porphyry, possibly; a compact\r\nfeldspathic base, with crystals of feldspar. Ajasson refuses to\r\nidentify it with porphyry, and considers it to be the stone called _Red\r\nantique_, of a deep uniform red, and of a very fine grain; which also\r\nwas a production of Egypt.\r\n\r\n[2510] “Small stone.”\r\n\r\n[2511] Of porphyrites.\r\n\r\n[2512] “Procurator.”\r\n\r\n[2513] See B. xxxvi. c. 38. See also the Lydian stone, or touchstone,\r\nmentioned in B. xxxiii. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[2514] From Βάσανος, a “touchstone.”\r\n\r\n[2515] Philostratus gives a short account of this group, and copies of\r\nit are to be seen in the Vatican, and in the grounds of the Tuilleries.\r\n\r\n[2516] See B. v. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[2517] The Egyptians called it, not Memnon, but Amenophis, and it is\r\nsupposed that it represented a monarch of the second dynasty. This is\r\nprobably the statue still to be seen at Medinet Abou, on the Libyan\r\nside of the Nile, in a sitting posture, and at least 60 feet in\r\nheight. The legs, arms, and other parts of the body are covered with\r\ninscriptions, which attest that, in the third century of the Christian\r\nera, the priests still practised upon the credulity of the devotees, by\r\npretending that it emitted sounds. It may possibly have been erected\r\nfor astronomical purposes, or for the mystic worship of the sun. The\r\nGreek name “Memnon” is supposed to have been derived from the Egyptian\r\n_Mei Amun_, “beloved of Ammon.”\r\n\r\n[2518] Ajasson remarks that under this name the ancients meant, first,\r\nyellow calcareous Alabaster, and secondly, Chalcedony, unclassified.\r\n\r\n[2519] See end of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2520] See B. vi. cc. 27, 28, 32.\r\n\r\n[2521] “Variatum est.”\r\n\r\n[2522] Ajasson thinks that these columns, in reality, were made, in\r\nboth instances, of yellow jasper, or else yellow sardonyx, a compound\r\nof sard and chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[2523] Erected A.U.C. 741.\r\n\r\n[2524] See B. xxxiii. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2525] The reading here is doubtful, and it is questionable whether he\r\nconsiders the two stones as identical.\r\n\r\n[2526] Probably calcareous Alabaster, Ajasson thinks. See B. xxxvii. c.\r\n54.\r\n\r\n[2527] See B. xiii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2528] Plaster of Paris is made of gypsum or alabaster, heated and\r\nground.\r\n\r\n[2529] A feature both of jasper and of sardonyx.\r\n\r\n[2530] By some persons it has been considered to be the same with the\r\n“lychnitis,” or white marble, mentioned in Chapter 4 of this Book.\r\nAjasson is of opinion that it has not been identified.\r\n\r\n[2531] Ajasson is in doubt whether this stone was really a marble or\r\na gypsic alabaster. It received its name from the river Curalius or\r\nCoural, near which it was found; and it was also known as Sangaric\r\nmarble. Ajasson thinks that the ancient milk-white marble, still found\r\nin Italy, and known to the dealers in antiquities as _Palombino_, may\r\nhave been the “corallitic” stone. He also mentions the fine white\r\nmarble known as _Grechetto_.\r\n\r\n[2532] See B. v. c. 29. Sulphuret of manganese is now known as\r\nAlabandine; it is black, but becomes of a tarnished brown on exposure\r\nto the air. It is not improbable that this manganese was used for\r\ncolouring glass, and that in Chapter 66 of this Book Pliny again refers\r\nto manganese when speaking of a kind of “magnet” or load-stone. See\r\nBeckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. pp. 237-8, _Bohn’s Edition_; who thinks,\r\nthat in the present passage Pliny is speaking of a kind of marble.\r\nIt is the fact, however, that Pyrolusite, or grey ore of manganese,\r\nis used, at a red heat, for discharging the brown and green tints of\r\nglass. See also B. xxxiv. c. 42, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[2533] Syenite is the name still given to feldspar, hornblende,\r\nand quartz, passing into each other by insensible gradations, and\r\nresembling granite.\r\n\r\n[2534] “Varied with red spots,” similar to our red granite.\r\n\r\n[2535] “Obelisci.” So called from ὀβελισκὸς, a “small spit,”\r\nin consequence of their tapering form.\r\n\r\n[2536] Meaning, probably, that in the Egyptian language, the same\r\nword is used as signifying a “spit” and a “ray” of light; for it is\r\ngenerally agreed that the word “obeliscus” is of Greek origin.\r\n\r\n[2537] He does not appear to have been identified; and the correct\r\nreading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[2538] Heliopolis, or On. See B. v. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2539] These figures or hieroglyphics did not denote the _phonetic\r\nlanguage_ of Egypt, but only formed a symbolical writing.\r\n\r\n[2540] Perhaps the same as “Sesostris.” The former reading is “Sothis.”\r\n\r\n[2541] Ajasson identifies him with Rameses III., a king of the\r\neighteenth dynasty, who reigned B.C. 1561. This was also one of the\r\nnames of Sesostris the Great.\r\n\r\n[2542] The name of the bull divinity worshipped by the people of On, or\r\nHeliopolis; while by the people of Memphis it was known as Apis.\r\n\r\n[2543] This, Hardouin says, was the same obelisk that was afterwards\r\nerected by Constantius, son of Constantine the Great, in the Circus\r\nMaximus at Rome; whence it was removed by Pope Sextus V., in the year\r\n1588, to the Basilica of the Lateran.\r\n\r\n[2544] This name is probably mutilated: there are about twenty\r\ndifferent readings of it.\r\n\r\n[2545] This name is also very doubtful. One reading is “Eraph,” and\r\nHardouin attempts to identify him with the Pharaoh Hophra of Jeremiah,\r\nxliv. 30, the Ouafres of the Chronicle of Eusebius, and the Apries of\r\nHerodotus.\r\n\r\n[2546] The Nectanabis, probably, of Plutarch, in his Life of Agesilaüs,\r\nand the Nectanebus of Nepos, in the Life of Chabrias.\r\n\r\n[2547] Callixenus of Rhodes was a contemporary of Ptolemy Philadelphus,\r\nand was the author of a description of Alexandria, and of a catalogue\r\nof painters and sculptors.\r\n\r\n[2548] Egyptian talents, probably. See. B. xxxiii. c. 15.\r\n\r\n[2549] Evidently a stupendous monument, or rather aggregate of\r\nbuildings, erected by Ptolemy II., Philadelphus, in memory of his wife\r\nand sister, Arsinoë. See B. xxxiv. c. 42.\r\n\r\n[2550] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2551] See B. xvi. c. 76, and B. xxxv. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2552] Or Circus Maximus; in the Eleventh Region of the City. According\r\nto Kircher, it was this obelisk that Pope Sextus V. had disinterred,\r\nand placed before the church of the Madonna del Popolo.\r\n\r\n[2553] There are sixteen various readings to this name.\r\n\r\n[2554] Diogenes Laertius says that he arrived in Egypt in the reign of\r\nKing Amasis.\r\n\r\n[2555] Boscovich and Brotero would read here “_eighty-two_ feet and\r\nthree quarters,” which is more in accordance with its height, as\r\nmeasured by Kircher.\r\n\r\n[2556] After being long buried in ruins, it was disinterred, but not\r\nre-erected, by Pope Benedict XIV. When thus brought to light, it was\r\nfound to be broken asunder. On it there was an inscription stating that\r\nthe Emperor Augustus had “presented it to the Sun”—“Soli donum dedit.”\r\n\r\n[2557] Twelve o’clock in the day.\r\n\r\n[2558] After the summer solstice.\r\n\r\n[2559] The one that is mentioned above as having been removed from\r\nAlexandria by Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2560] This obelisk was transferred by Pope Sextus V. from the Circus\r\nVaticanus to the place of the Cathedral of St. Peter.\r\n\r\n[2561] So called because it was laid out on some gardens which had\r\nbelonged to one Vaticanus.\r\n\r\n[2562] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2563] There are nine or ten readings of this name. Bunsen suggests\r\n“Menophtheus,” the Egyptian king Meneph-Pthah.\r\n\r\n[2564] In Egypt, probably.\r\n\r\n[2565] Ajasson thinks that they were intended as places of sepulture\r\nfor the kings, but for the concealment, also, of their treasures.\r\n\r\n[2566] See B. v. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2567] In Chapter 19 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2568] See B. v. c. 9. Herodotus says that these pyramids were built by\r\nKing Mœris, in the middle of the lake, towering fifty paces above the\r\nsurface of the water. Diodorus Siculus says that they were built by him\r\nin honour of himself and his wife.\r\n\r\n[2569] Or left-hand side to those coming down the stream. He alludes\r\nto the three great Pyramids of Ghizeh, not far from Cairo. There are\r\nnumerous other pyramids to be seen in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[2570] In B. v. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2571] It still exists, though the face is mutilated. It was\r\ndisinterred from the sand by Belzoni, but is now again nearly covered.\r\nAccording to Cavaglia, the signature of the Historian Arrian was found\r\ninscribed on one of the fore-paws, when it was disinterred.\r\n\r\n[2572] This reading is, perhaps, preferable to the LXI. s, (61½) of\r\nthe Bamberg MS. The head and neck, when uncovered, were found to be 27\r\nfeet in height.\r\n\r\n[2573] Built by King Cheops, according to Herodotus, B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2574] All these writers are mentioned in the list of authors at the\r\nend of the present Book.\r\n\r\n[2575] For the use of the workmen. There is, probably, no foundation\r\nfor a statement so exact as this; as it would be very singular that\r\nsuch a fact should continue to be known, and the names of the builders\r\nbe buried in oblivion.\r\n\r\n[2576] According to modern measurement, the sides of its base measure\r\nat the foundation 763 feet 4 inches, and it occupies a space of more\r\nthan 13 acres. Its perpendicular height is 480 feet.\r\n\r\n[2577] Other readings are 883, and 783.\r\n\r\n[2578] Differing very considerably from the modern measurement. These\r\nvariations may possibly arise, however, from a large portion of the\r\nbase being covered with sand.\r\n\r\n[2579] It was entirely coated with marble from the Thebaid; which,\r\nhowever, was removed by the Arabs in the middle ages. In the vicinity\r\nthere is a fourth pyramid, but of such small dimensions that some of\r\nthe Egyptian obelisks exceed it in height.\r\n\r\n[2580] “Nitrum.” See B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2581] From this reason being given, it would almost appear that these\r\n“bridges” in reality were aqueducts, for conveying the water, in order\r\nto melt the mounds of salt and nitre.\r\n\r\n[2582] A very improbable story, as Ajasson remarks; as if the method of\r\nascertaining the heights of edifices was unknown to the sages of Egypt,\r\nand the constructors of the Pyramids!\r\n\r\n[2583] Herodotus, B. ii. cc. 134, 5, takes great pains to prove the\r\nabsurdity of this story; and there is little doubt that the beautiful\r\ncourtesan has been confounded with the equally beautiful Egyptian\r\nQueen, Nitocris, who is said by Julius Africanus and Eusebius to have\r\nbuilt the third pyramid. As to the courtesan having been a fellow-slave\r\nof the fabulist, Æsop, it is extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n[2584] The greater harbour, there being two at Alexandria.\r\n\r\n[2585] Ptolemy Lagus.\r\n\r\n[2586] Supposed by Thiersch to have been the same person as the\r\nstatuary mentioned in B. xxxiv. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2587] A risk that is now obviated, if, indeed, there is such a risk,\r\nby the use of revolving lights and coloured lights.\r\n\r\n[2588] See B. v. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2589] The site of this labyrinth has not been traced, but Sir G.\r\nWilkinson is inclined to think that it was at Howarah el Soghaïr in the\r\nFaiöum.\r\n\r\n[2590] Similar, probably, to the one at Hampton Court.\r\n\r\n[2591] Most modern writers, and some of the ancients, have altogether\r\ndenied the existence of the Cretan Labyrinth; but, judging from the\r\ntestimony of Tournefort and Cockerell, it is most probable that it\r\nreally did exist, and that it was a vast natural grotto or cavern,\r\nenlarged and made additionally intricate by human ingenuity. There\r\nare many caverns of this nature in Crete, and one near Gortyna, at\r\nHagios-Deka, is replete with galleries and intricate windings similar\r\nto those ascribed to the Labyrinth of Dædalus.\r\n\r\n[2592] See Chapter 13 of this Book. He is surprised that the people of\r\nEgypt, a country which abounded in exquisite marbles, should have used\r\nthat of another country in preference to their own.\r\n\r\n[2593] As to the meaning of this word, see B. v. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2594] See Chapter 5 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2595] “Ulnæ.” See Introduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[2596] The ἄρουρα was a Greek square measure, containing 2500\r\nsquare feet.\r\n\r\n[2597] See Chapter 11 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2598] As to the meaning of this word, see Chapter 4 of this Book, page\r\n317, and Note 2429.\r\n\r\n[2599] “Circummon” is a more common reading.\r\n\r\n[2600] Or acacia. See B. xxiv. c. 65.\r\n\r\n[2601] Welcker remarks that it is uncertain whether this Labyrinth was\r\nerected as a temple of the Cabiri, or whether it had any connection\r\nwith the art of mining.\r\n\r\n[2602] Smilis lived, probably, 200 years before Rhœcus and Theodorus,\r\nand was a native of Ægina, not Lemnos. Sillig, however, is inclined\r\nto think that there were _two_ artists of this name; the elder a\r\ncontemporary of Dædalus, and the maker of several wooden statues.\r\n\r\n[2603] See B. xxxv. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[2604] See B. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2605] A round, broad-brimmed hat, such as we see represented in the\r\nstatues of Mercury.\r\n\r\n[2606] Where two brazen vessels were erected on a column, adjoining to\r\nwhich was the statue of a boy with a whip; which, when agitated by the\r\nwind, struck the vessels, and omens were drawn from the tinkling noise\r\nproduced, significant of future events, it was supposed.\r\n\r\n[2607] A building like this, as Niebuhr says, is absolutely impossible,\r\nand belongs to the “Arabian Nights.” The description in some\r\nparticulars resembles that of a Chinese pagoda.\r\n\r\n[2608] Probably of Babylon, which were built on terraces raised on\r\narches.\r\n\r\n[2609] His meaning is, that it was built upon arches.\r\n\r\n[2610] Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[2611] The Hotel de Ville at Brussels is said to have been built upon a\r\nstratum of hides.\r\n\r\n[2612] See Chapter 4 of the present Book. Sillig, in his “Dictionary of\r\nAncient Artists,” suggests a reading which would make the passage to\r\nmean that Scopas was jointly architect with Chersiphron. The latter,\r\nhowever, was _not_ the architect of the _second_ temple at Ephesus, but\r\nflourished nearly four hundred years before.\r\n\r\n[2613] Strabo says that, in conjunction with his son Metagenes, he\r\nbegan the _first_ Temple at Ephesus. Thiersch is of opinion that he\r\nlived about the first Olympiad, He is mentioned also in B. vii. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2614] “Epistylia.” See B. xxxv. c. 49.\r\n\r\n[2615] Which must have been above the bags and at the summit of the\r\ninclined plane.\r\n\r\n[2616] See B. v. c. 40.\r\n\r\n[2617] “Lapis Fugitivus.”\r\n\r\n[2618] A public place where the Prytanes or chief magistrates\r\nassembled, and where the public banquets were celebrated.\r\n\r\n[2619] Or “Narrow” gate, apparently. Dion Cassius, B. 74, tells a\r\nsimilar story nearly, of seven towers at Byzantium, near the _Thracian\r\nGate_; and “Thracia” is given by the Bamberg MS. It is most probable\r\nthat the two accounts were derived from the same source.\r\n\r\n[2620] Ἑπτάφωνον, “seven times vocal.” Plutarch also mentions\r\nthis portico.\r\n\r\n[2621] Βουλευτήριον, the “senate house” or “council-chamber.”\r\n\r\n[2622] It was the most ancient of the bridges at Rome, and was so\r\ncalled from its being built upon “sublices,” or wooden beams. It was\r\noriginally built by Ancus Martius, and was afterwards rebuilt by the\r\nPontifices or pontiffs. We learn from Ovid, Fasti, B. v. l. 621, that\r\nit was still a wooden bridge in the reign of Augustus. In the reign of\r\nOtho it was carried away by an inundation. In later times it was also\r\nknown as the Pons Æmilius, from the name of the person probably under\r\nwhose superintendence it was rebuilt.\r\n\r\n[2623] See B. xxxiv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[2624] L. Æmilius Paulus, who was consul with C. Marcellus, A.U.C.\r\n703. His Basilica, a building which served as a court of law and as an\r\nexchange, was erected in the Eighth Region of the City, at the cost\r\nof 1500 talents; which were sent to him by Cæsar, Plutarch says, as a\r\nbribe to gain him over from the aristocratical party. It was surrounded\r\nwith an open peristyle of columns of Phrygian marble.\r\n\r\n[2625] “Diribitorium.” See B. xvi. c. 76.\r\n\r\n[2626] Scribonius Libo, who was Ædile during the consulship of Cicero.\r\n\r\n[2627] “Mound,” or “Terrace.” See B. iii. c. 9, where it is ascribed to\r\nTarquinius Superbus; but Strabo seems to attribute its foundation to\r\nServius Tullius.\r\n\r\n[2628] Thebes, in Egypt. See Chapter 20 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2629] A.U.C. 721. He alludes probably to the cleansing of the sewers\r\nbeneath the city, which took place, Dion Cassius informs us, in the\r\nædileship of Agrippa.\r\n\r\n[2630] As Hardouin remarks, the story of the Milesian Virgins, as\r\nrelated by Aulus Gellius and Plutarch, is very similar.\r\n\r\n[2631] A.U.C. 676.\r\n\r\n[2632] Caligula. The Palace of Caligula was situate on the Palatine\r\nHill] that of Nero extended from the Palatine Hill to the Esquiline,\r\nnearly the whole of which was covered by it. It was left unfinished\r\nby Nero, but the Emperor Otho completed it. Martial, Spectac. Ep. 2,\r\nspeaks in terms of indignation of there being now “but one house in all\r\nthe City;” but, unfortunately, he gives utterance to it with a view of\r\nflattering Domitian.\r\n\r\n[2633] Whence its name, “Aurea,” the “golden” Palace.\r\n\r\n[2634] “Sellaria.”\r\n\r\n[2635] By this mode of expression, he probably means that they were\r\n“birds of a feather”—one as bad as the other.\r\n\r\n[2636] His mother, Metella Cæcilia, became the wife of Sylla.\r\n\r\n[2637] He forgets the Pyramids and the Labyrinth of Egypt, which he has\r\nso recently described.\r\n\r\n[2638] See B. xvii. c. 1, and Chapter 3 of the present Book. L. Crassus\r\nis the person alluded to.\r\n\r\n[2639] “Four” is the number mentioned in B. xvii. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[2640] In Chapter 2 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2641] In B. xxxiv. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2642] “Cavea.” The place where the spectators sat, much like the “pit”\r\nof our theatres.\r\n\r\n[2643] See B. xxxiii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2644] “Choragio.”\r\n\r\n[2645] He was defeated and slain in Africa by Juba and P. Attius Varus.\r\n\r\n[2646] And, consequently, of more strict manners, and more strict\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\n[2647] “Tabulis.” The wooden frames, probably, which formed the\r\nmargin of one side of each theatre, and which, when they were brought\r\ntogether, would make a diameter running through the circle which they\r\nformed. Hardouin thinks that these theatres are alluded to in Virgil,\r\nGeorg. B. III. l. 22, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2648] In allusion, probably, to the addresses delivered by Curio, when\r\ntribune, from the Rostra, in favour of Cæsar.\r\n\r\n[2649] “Pensiles.” Pliny not improbably intends a pun here, this word\r\nmeaning also “suspended,” or “poised”—in reference, probably, to their\r\nsuspension on the pivots in Curio’s theatres.\r\n\r\n[2650] Between Cæsar and Pompey, which he is supposed to have inflamed\r\nfor his own private purposes.\r\n\r\n[2651] He was prætor B.C. 144; and, in order that he might complete his\r\naqueduct, his office was prolonged another year.\r\n\r\n[2652] This aqueduct was begun by Appius Claudius Cæcus, the censor,\r\nand was the first made at Rome; B.C. 313.\r\n\r\n[2653] See B. iii. c. 17. It was commenced by M. Curius Dentatus, B.C.\r\n273, the water being brought a distance of 43 miles. It was afterwards\r\nknown as the “Anio Vetus,” to distinguish it from another aqueduct from\r\nthe same river, mentioned in this Chapter, and called the “Anio Novus.”\r\nThe former was constructed of Peperino stone, and the water-course was\r\nlined with cement. Considerable remains of it are still to be seen.\r\n\r\n[2654] The Aqua Tepula was constructed B.C. 127; so that it is doubtful\r\nif Pliny is not here in error.\r\n\r\n[2655] The Aqua Marcia was brought a distance of upwards of 60 miles,\r\nfrom the vicinity of Sublaqueum, now Subiaco, and was of such elevation\r\nthat water could be supplied to the loftiest part of the Capitoline\r\nHill. A considerable number of the arches are still standing. In the\r\nvicinity of the city it was afterwards united with the Aqua Tepula and\r\nthe Aqua Julia; the watercourse of the last being above that of the\r\nAqua Tepula, and that above the course of the Aqua Marcia. See B. xxxi.\r\ncc. 24, 25.\r\n\r\n[2656] See B. xxxi. cc. 24, 25.\r\n\r\n[2657] See B. xxxi. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[2658] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2659] Victor mentions 856 public baths at Rome.\r\n\r\n[2660] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2661] Anio Novus.\r\n\r\n[2662] Nero.\r\n\r\n[2663] See B. ii. c. 106, and B. iii. c. 17. In order to check the\r\nsudden rise of its waters, a design was entertained by Julius Cæsar to\r\nconstruct a subterranean canal from the lake into the valley of the\r\nLiris, which, unfortunately, was frustrated by his death. Claudius,\r\nhowever, executed the work, by cutting a gallery upwards of an English\r\nmile and a half through the limestone rock; a work which, according\r\nto Suetonius, occupied thirty thousand workmen continually for eleven\r\nyears. On opening it with a mock naval combat, an accident happened in\r\nwhich many persons lost their lives, and Claudius himself but narrowly\r\nescaped. The emissary answered its purpose for some time, and, though\r\nNero suffered the works to fall into decay, they were repaired by\r\nHadrian. In the middle ages, however, the work fell in, and has not\r\nsince been restored.\r\n\r\n[2664] See B. iii. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[2665] “Magnes.”\r\n\r\n[2666] In Chapter 23 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2667] “Iron earth;” from σίδηρος, “iron.” The magnet, or\r\nloadstone itself, is an oxide of iron, known as Oxidulated iron, or\r\nFerroso-ferric oxide; sometimes in combination with quartz or alumine.\r\n\r\n[2668] From Heraclea, in Lydia, or in Thessaly, according to some\r\naccounts. It is not improbable, however, that it was so called after\r\n“Heracles,” or Hercules, on account of its powerful influence upon iron\r\nores.\r\n\r\n[2669] Isidorus says, “India,” in B. 16 of the “Origines.”\r\n\r\n[2670] See the list of authors at the end of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2671] Varieties, no doubt, of oxide of iron.\r\n\r\n[2672] An absurd distinction, as Ajasson remarks; based, probably,\r\non Eastern notions, and with reference to the comparative powers of\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\n[2673] From αἷμα, “blood.” He alludes to Specular iron, red\r\nochre, or red hematite, another oxide of iron.\r\n\r\n[2674] Sometimes it has, but in a very slight degree.\r\n\r\n[2675] Ajasson remarks that most probably the possessors of this\r\npretended variety knew the distinction between the two poles of the\r\nmagnet, and took care, when it was their interest to do so, to place\r\nthe opposite pole towards that of the other loadstone.\r\n\r\n[2676] It was the belief of the Duke of Noya Caraffa, that this stone\r\nwas identical with Tourmaline: but, as Beckmann says, tourmaline, when\r\nheated, first attracts iron, and then repels it. Hist. Inv. Vol. I. pp.\r\n87, 88. _Bohn’s Edition._ Ajasson is of opinion that the Theamedes was\r\nneither more nor less than the ordinary loadstone, with the negative\r\npole presented, by designing persons, towards another magnet.\r\n\r\n[2677] In B. ii. c. 98, and B. xx. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[2678] See B. iv. c. 23.\r\n\r\n[2679] See B. ii. c. 106, Vol. I. p. 137, and Note 687. There is little\r\ndoubt that this was a volcanic, porous product.\r\n\r\n[2680] From σάρξ, “flesh,” and φάγω, “to eat.” See B. ii. c. 98.\r\nAjasson identifies it with Alunite, or Alum stone, in its several\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n[2681] Both of them varieties of calcareous tufa, Ajasson thinks.\r\n\r\n[2682] Or Sarcophagus: see the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2683] Democritus, amongst the ancients, and Savonarola and Cardan,\r\nin more recent times, have attributed to stones the powers of\r\nreproduction. Vivès speaks of certain diamonds which conceive and\r\nfructify; and Avicenna speaks of the selenite or moon-stone of Arabia,\r\nwhich, when suspended from a tree, generates other stones of a similar\r\nnature. Tournefort also entertained similar opinions.\r\n\r\n[2684] Fossil teeth of mammiferæ, probably.\r\n\r\n[2685] Fossil animal remains, no doubt.\r\n\r\n[2686] Cneius Pompeius. See B. iii. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2687] “Palmati.” This is more probably the meaning, than the “human\r\npalm,” as Littré renders it. They were fossil impressions of leaves, in\r\nall probability.\r\n\r\n[2688] See Chapter 43 of this Book: also B. iv. cc. 7, 8.\r\n\r\n[2689] Stones so called, possibly, from being found in the vicinity of\r\nCora in Italy: See B. iii. c. 9. These stones are also mentioned by\r\nIsidorus, Orig. B. xvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2690] Identified by Ajasson and Desfontaines? with Quartz molar agate,\r\nvery abundant in this volcanic region of Italy.\r\n\r\n[2691] “Molares.” “Millstone.”\r\n\r\n[2692] Or Serpentine. See Chapter 11 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2693] Not the Pyrites of modern Mineralogy, combinations of sulphur\r\nwith various mineral ores.\r\n\r\n[2694] The Greek for “fire” being πῦρ.\r\n\r\n[2695] Sulphate of copper, probably, our Chalcopyrite, or yellow copper\r\npyrites.\r\n\r\n[2696] See B. v. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[2697] Or “quick,” “vivos.” Ajasson identifies these with the quartz\r\nagates that form our gun-flints, a Chalcedonic variety of Silica.\r\n\r\n[2698] Amadue, or German tinder.\r\n\r\n[2699] Fossil shells of oysters and bivalve mollusks, combined,\r\nprobably, with Fahlunite or Hydrous Iolite.\r\n\r\n[2700] This is the most delicate variety of Asbestus, a kind of\r\nHornblende: it presents the lustre of satin. As to Asbestus, see\r\nB. xix. c. 4, where Pliny has evidently taken it to be a vegetable\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n[2701] See B. xxxv. c. 52.\r\n\r\n[2702] “Earthy” stone. These are either nodules of iron-stone, hollow\r\nin the centre, or else round, inorganic masses, hollow, and lined with\r\ncrystals within. These latter are mostly of a silicious nature.\r\n\r\n[2703] It was, probably, a yellow, argillaceous earth, and it is more\r\nprobable that it derived its name from μελὶ, “honey,” in consequence of\r\nits colour than by reason of its supposed sweet juices. The Mellite,\r\nMellitite, or Honey-stone of modern Mineralogy, also known as Mellate\r\nof Alumina, has its name from its honey-yellow colour. It is found in\r\nThuringia, Moravia, and Bohemia; but most probably was unknown in the\r\ndays of Pliny.\r\n\r\n[2704] See B. xx. cc. 6, 21.\r\n\r\n[2705] Our jet, which somewhat resembles cannel-coal, and is found in\r\nclay soils.\r\n\r\n[2706] See B. v. c. 28, where a place called “Gagæ” is mentioned. In\r\nNote 3900 to that Chapter, “gagates” is erroneously rendered “agate.”\r\n\r\n[2707] See B. v. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[2708] This comparison is not inapt, as it is closely akin to Lignite,\r\nor brown coal.\r\n\r\n[2709] A bituminous and animal odour, Ajasson says, quite peculiar to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[2710] He has borrowed this erroneous assertion, probably, from\r\nNicander, who, with Pliny, says the same of the “Thracian stone,” which\r\nhas not been identified, but is supposed to have been a sort of coal.\r\nSee B. xxxiii. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[2711] This is, probably, the meaning of “sonticus morbus,” a disease,\r\nwhich, according to the jurists, excused those affected with it, from\r\nattending in courts of justice.\r\n\r\n[2712] Albertus Magnus, De Mineral. B. ii., says that if it is given in\r\nwater to a female, it will have a diuretic effect immediately, if she\r\nis not in a state of virginity, and that the contrary will be the case\r\nif she is.\r\n\r\n[2713] See B. xxx. c. 5. According to Dalechamps, this was practised by\r\nplacing the jet upon a hatchet at a red heat.\r\n\r\n[2714] “Stone-macerater.” From τήκω, to “macerate,” and λιθὸς, “a\r\nstone.”\r\n\r\n[2715] Dioscorides says that it was found in Cappadocia also; and both\r\nhe and Galen attribute to it certain medicinal properties. It was used\r\neither for colouring, or else, like fuller’s earth, for taking the\r\ngrease out of wool and cloth. Ajasson is inclined to think that it was\r\neither a volcanic scoria or a Peperite, also of volcanic origin.\r\n\r\n[2716] Or “blood-stone,” mentioned already in Chapter 25 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2717] He is evidently speaking here of the red peroxide of iron.\r\n\r\n[2718] Vermilion. See B. xxxiii. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[2719] Literally, “split” stone; so called, probably, from its\r\nlaminated form. Ajasson identifies it with yellow or brown iron ore,\r\nknown in Mineralogy as Limonite, or Brown Hematite.\r\n\r\n[2720] “Explendis oculorum lacunis.”\r\n\r\n[2721] Mentioned in Chapter 25 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2722] Mentioned also in Chapter 25. Probably Red peroxide of iron, in\r\na massive form.\r\n\r\n[2723] “All-serviceable,” or “all-heal.”\r\n\r\n[2724] “Man-subduing.”\r\n\r\n[2725] The colour of Specular iron, or red peroxide of iron, being of a\r\ndark steel-grey or iron-black, this is probably another variety of it.\r\nAjasson thinks that it includes compact or massive red oxide of iron,\r\nand scaly red iron, or red iron froth, which leaves red marks upon the\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\n[2726] See Chapter 11 of this Book. Its alleged attraction of silver\r\nand copper is fabulous, no doubt.\r\n\r\n[2727] This is probably the Limonite, or Hydrous peroxide of iron,\r\nmentioned in the preceding Chapter. See Note 2719 above.\r\n\r\n[2728] Identified by Ajasson with Red ochre, or Reddle, a red peroxide\r\nof iron, used for red crayons in drawing.\r\n\r\n[2729] “Liver-stone.” Not to be confounded with the Hepatite of modern\r\nMineralogy, or Sulphate of Barytes.\r\n\r\n[2730] “Spleen-stone.”\r\n\r\n[2731] See B. xxxv. c. 14.\r\n\r\n[2732] Identified by Ajasson with Laminated protoxide of iron. It has\r\nprobably an affinity to the variety noticed above, in Notes 2719 and 2727.\r\n\r\n[2733] Owing solely, in all probability, to its name, “blood-stone.”\r\n\r\n[2734] Ajasson is at a loss to know whether this is our Anthracite, a\r\nnon-bituminous coal, or some kind of bituminous coal. Delafosse takes\r\nit to be pit-coal.\r\n\r\n[2735] Or “eagle-stone.” It is a Geodes, mentioned in Chapter 23 of\r\nthis Book, a globular mass of clay iron-stone. Sometimes it is hollow\r\nwithin, and sometimes it encloses another stone, or a little water, or\r\nsome mineral dust.\r\n\r\n[2736] Chapter 4.\r\n\r\n[2737] See B. iv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2738] A kind of pumice, Ajasson thinks, or porous feldspathic scoria\r\nfrom volcanos.\r\n\r\n[2739] In B. xxxv. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[2740] In Chapter 37 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2741] See B. xxiii. cc. 45, 80.\r\n\r\n[2742] Probably of a similar nature to the Samian stone.\r\n\r\n[2743] Pumice is still used as the basis of a dentifrice, but it\r\ndestroys the enamel of the teeth.\r\n\r\n[2744] See Note 2739 above.\r\n\r\n[2745] Or “temples of the Muses:” evidently grottos in the present\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n[2746] In allusion to the line, “Aridâ modo pumice expolitum”—“Just\r\npolished with dry pumice-stone.” Ep. I. l. 2. Both the backs of books\r\nand the parchment used for writing were rubbed with pumice.\r\n\r\n[2747] Sec B. v. c. 36.\r\n\r\n[2748] See B. xxxiv. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[2749] Hist. B. ix. c. 18.\r\n\r\n[2750] As a preventive of vomiting.\r\n\r\n[2751] “Musta.” Grape-juice in the process of being made into wine.\r\n\r\n[2752] Delafosse suggests that this may have been grey-spotted granite.\r\nThe name is doubtful, as “Edesian” and “Ephesian” are other readings.\r\n\r\n[2753] In Chapter 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2754] “Golden stone.” A variety, perhaps, of the Thebaic stone with\r\ngold spots, mentioned in Chapter 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2755] Possibly so called from Χάλαζα, “hail,” it being, perhaps, a\r\ngranite with spots like hailstones.\r\n\r\n[2756] Sec Chapters 11 and 33 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2757] In consequence of its extreme hardness.\r\n\r\n[2758] Phœnician stone and Tænarian stone do not appear to have been\r\nidentified. Parian stone may probably have been white Parian marble.\r\n\r\n[2759] See Chapter 12 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2760] Serpentine. See Chapters 11 and 30.\r\n\r\n[2761] See B. iv. cc. 22, 23.\r\n\r\n[2762] Ajasson identifies it with Ollar stone, talc, or soap-stone,\r\na hydrous silicate of magnesia, and nearly allied to the Ophites of\r\nChapters 11 and 30.\r\n\r\n[2763] He being a native of that part of Italy.\r\n\r\n[2764] The Green Colubine Ollar stone; or soap-stone of Italy.\r\n\r\n[2765] See B. iii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[2766] Identified by Brotero with our Free-stone or grit-stone.\r\n\r\n[2767] So called from its resemblance to the spots on a peacock’s tail.\r\nHe alludes, probably, to the mode of roofing with tiles cut in the form\r\nof scales, still much employed on the continent, and in Switzerland\r\nmore particularly.\r\n\r\n[2768] Or “Mirror-stone.” Transparent Selenite or gypsum; a sulphate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n[2769] Now Segorba, in Valentia.\r\n\r\n[2770] Ajasson is of opinion that various kinds of mica and talc are\r\nthe minerals here alluded to.\r\n\r\n[2771] From φεγγὸς, “brightness.” Beckmann is of opinion that\r\nthis was a calcareous or gypseous spar (Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 66); but\r\nAjasson seems to think that it was very similar to Parian marble, which\r\nwas sometimes called by this name.\r\n\r\n[2772] This is more likely to apply to a white marble than to a\r\ncalcareous or gypseous spar. Suetonius says, c. 14, that Domitian, when\r\nhe suspected that plots were forming against him, caused the porticos\r\nin which he walked to be lined with Phengites, which by its reflection\r\nshowed what was going on behind his back.\r\n\r\n[2773] See B xviii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2774] See Chapter 24 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2775] Beckmann says, in reference to this passage, supposing that a\r\nkind of _spar_ is meant by the word _phengites_—“It is probable that\r\nthe openings of the walls of the building where the windows used to be,\r\nwere in this instance filled up with _phengites_. which, by admitting a\r\nfaint light, prevented the place from being dark, even when the doors\r\nwere shut.”— Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 66. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2776] In Chapter 10 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2777] See B. v. cc. 22, 35, for two places of this name.\r\n\r\n[2778] A Celtic word, probably.\r\n\r\n[2779] See B. iii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2780] Identical, probably, with the Tufa of modern Mineralogy, which\r\nthence derives its name, a Carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n[2781] Thus reversing the order of things with the Romans, who put the\r\nlime on their houses, and the pitch in their wines. See B. xiv. cc. 3,\r\n24, 25.\r\n\r\n[2782] See B. xiv. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[2783] A white tufa, Vitruvius says, B. i. c. 7.\r\n\r\n[2784] It was in reference, possibly, to this stone that Cicero made\r\nthe remark, mentioned in Chapter 5 of this Book; the heat of Chios\r\nbeing so great, perhaps, that the Tiburtine stone could not have\r\nendured it.\r\n\r\n[2785] A general name for Silica, Flint, or Quartz, and the several\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n[2786] See B. iii. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2787] See B. ii. c. 96, B. iii. c. 9, and B. xiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2788] Ajasson thinks that Travertine is meant; a tufa, or carbonate of\r\nlime, which is common in Tuscany.\r\n\r\n[2789] “Built of stones of equal size.”\r\n\r\n[2790] “Built of stones of unequal sizes.”\r\n\r\n[2791] “Filled up work,” apparently.\r\n\r\n[2792] The reading is very doubtful here: for the word seems to mean,\r\nin Greek, “From one wall to another.” “Diamicton”—“Mixed up,” is\r\nanother reading.\r\n\r\n[2793] Where the outer face of each stone forms an exact square; the\r\npointings consequently having a netlike or reticulated appearance.\r\n\r\n[2794] The vertical pointings or junctures lying one over the other.\r\n\r\n[2795] De Re Rust. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2796] See Chapters 29 and 30 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2797] To which Pozzuolane belongs.\r\n\r\n[2798] For making mortar.\r\n\r\n[2799] Pounded marble mixed with quicklime.\r\n\r\n[2800] “Lacte et croco” appears to be a preferable reading to “late e\r\ncroco,” as given by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[2801] It seems difficult to understand whether by the word “spiræ” he\r\nmeans astragals, or bases. It would almost appear, by the use of the\r\nword “subditæ,” that it is “bases” for the shafts. It is just possible,\r\nhowever, that the meaning may be that the “spiræ” were placed _beneath_\r\nthe capitals which were added.\r\n\r\n[2802] A different thing altogether from the Maltha or Pissasphalt\r\nof B. ii. c. 108. Festus describes it as a mixture of pitch and wax;\r\nand Palladius, in B. i. c. 17, speaks of it as being composed of tar,\r\ngrease, and lime boiled; and in c. 35 he describes Maltha caldaria\r\nas a mixture of hammoniacum, figs, tow, tar, and melted suet. It was\r\nprobably a general name for several kinds of cement. Heineccius says\r\nthat it was employed for sealing, but on what authority does not\r\nappear. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 141. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2803] This is perhaps the meaning of “duplici lenimento.” The reading,\r\nhowever, is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[2804] The name now given to Sulphate of lime, including the varieties\r\nof Alabaster and Selenite. Plaster of Paris is prepared from it.\r\n\r\n[2805] The method of preparing plaster of Paris.\r\n\r\n[2806] See B. iv. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2807] See B. iv. c. 3.\r\n\r\n[2808] The same thing, strictly speaking. See Chapter 12 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2809] See Chapter 45 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2810] See B. vii. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2811] Dioscorides says, B. v. c. 134, that, taken internally, it\r\nproduces suffocation.\r\n\r\n[2812] “Lithostrota.”\r\n\r\n[2813] His age and country are unknown.\r\n\r\n[2814] “The house that has no sweeping.”\r\n\r\n[2815] “Subtegulanea.”—“Undercover;” in contradistinction to the\r\n“subdialia” of next Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2816] “Pavimentum,” from “pavio,” to “beat down.”\r\n\r\n[2817] “Scutulatum.”—Having figures in the shape of a lozenge or\r\nrhombus.\r\n\r\n[2818] The line is,\r\n\r\n“Arte pavimenti atque emblemate vermiculato;”\r\n\r\nliterary compositions being compared by him to the artificial\r\nconstruction of a pavement.\r\n\r\n[2819] “Subdialia;” more literally, “open-air pavements.”\r\n\r\n[2820] Or “kernel;” so called because it lay in the middle. Vitruvius\r\nsays that it was composed of one part lime, and three parts pounded\r\npottery.\r\n\r\n[2821] “Quercus.”\r\n\r\n[2822] “Spicata testacea.” These pavements were probably so called\r\nbecause the bricks were laid at angles to each other (of about\r\nforty-five degrees), like the grains in an ear of wheat; or like the\r\nspines projecting from either side of the back-bone of a fish.\r\n\r\n[2823] “Lithostrota.”\r\n\r\n[2824] In Chapter 24 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2825] See B. v. c. 17.\r\n\r\n[2826] See B. v. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[2827] A mineral alkali, Beckmann thinks; for it could not possibly be\r\nour saltpetre, he says. See B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[2828] Beckmann discredits this story, because sand, he says, is not\r\nso easily brought to a state of fusion. Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 496.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2829] “Magnes lapis.” See B. xxxiv. c. 42, and Chapter 25 of this\r\nBook. Beckmann is of opinion that an ore of Manganese is meant, a\r\nsubstance which has a resemblance to the magnet, and is of the greatest\r\nutility in making glass. Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 237.\r\n\r\n[2830] This appears to be the meaning of “Quoniam in se liquorem vitri\r\nquoque ut ferrum trahere creditur.”\r\n\r\n[2831] In the description given by Isidorus in the “Origines,” which in\r\nother respects is similar, these words are omitted, and it is possible\r\nthat they are a gloss by some one who was better acquainted with the\r\nOld Testament than with Pliny. On the other hand, as Sillig remarks,\r\nthe Phœnicians may, at an early period, have imported into Greece a\r\nsubstance which they called “nitre of Ophir.”\r\n\r\n[2832] See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 84.\r\n\r\n[2833] “Excogitaverat.” Beckmann would seem to give this word the force\r\nonly of “thought of,” for he gives it as his opinion that attempts were\r\nmade at Sidon to form glass mirrors, but that the experiments had not\r\ncompletely succeeded. “Had this invention formed an epoch in the art\r\nof making mirrors, Pliny, in another place (B. xxxiii. c. 45), where\r\nhe describes the various improvements of it so fully, would not have\r\nomitted it: but of those experiments he makes no further mention.”\r\nHe also expresses an opinion that the Sidonian mirrors consisted of\r\ndark-coloured glass, resembling obsidian stone.”—Hist. Inv. Vol. II.\r\npp. 69, 70. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2834] Knowles says, in his _Turkish History_, p. 1273, that in 1610,\r\namong other rare presents sent to the King of Spain from the Sophy of\r\nPersia, there were six drinking-glasses, made of malleable glass so\r\nexquisitely tempered that they could not be broken.\r\n\r\n[2835] Dion Cassius and Suetonius tell a similar story; and, according\r\nto one account, Tiberius ordered the artist to be put to death.\r\n\r\n[2836] This reading is doubtful. It would appear to mean “stone\r\nhandled.” Another reading is “pterotos,” “with winged handles.”\r\n\r\n[2837] Volcanic glass, feldspar in a more or less pure state, our\r\nObsidian, is probably meant; a word derived from the old reading,\r\nObsidius, corrected by Sillig to _Obsius_.\r\n\r\n[2838] He is speaking of the stone, not the glass that resembled it.\r\n\r\n[2839] A thing very difficult to be done, as Beckmann observes, by\r\nreason of its brittleness.\r\n\r\n[2840] The present Portugal.\r\n\r\n[2841] “Blood-red” glass.\r\n\r\n[2842] See B. xxxvii. cc. 7, 8, 11. This glass was probably of an opal\r\ncolour, like porcelain.\r\n\r\n[2843] This passage is commented upon by Beckmann, Vol. II. p. 75, in\r\nconnexion with a similar passage in Isidorus, Orig., which is probably\r\ncorrupt.\r\n\r\n[2844] See B. xxxvii. c. 10. He was not aware, apparently, that in\r\nsuch case they act as convex burning-glasses, and that ice even may be\r\nsimilarly employed.\r\n\r\n[2845] This is, probably, the meaning of “in guttas;” a new reading,\r\nwhich is only found in the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[2846] See B. xxxiv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[2847] See B. xxxiv. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[2848] “Improba” seems to be used here in much the some sense in which\r\nVirgil has said “Labor improbus”—“Unremitting labour.”\r\n\r\n[2849] He alludes, probably, to eclipses of the sun.\r\n\r\n[2850] Acacia charcoal is still recommended as a valuable tonic, and as\r\ngood for internal ulcerations and irritations of the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n[2851] In B. xxvi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2852] “Querneus.”\r\n\r\n[2853] It is much more likely that he was the son of Tarquin himself,\r\nwho not improbably, if indeed there ever was such a person, invented\r\nthe story, to escape the wrath of Queen Tanaquil. This absurd story is\r\nmentioned also by Ovid, Arnobius, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus.\r\n\r\n[2854] See B. iii. c. 9, and B. xix. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2855] See end of B. ii. L. Cælius Antipater.\r\n\r\n[2856] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2857] Probably Sulpicius Galba, who devoted his time to literary\r\npursuits, and rose to no higher office than the prætorship, He was\r\ngrand-father of the Emperor Galba, and wrote a historical work.\r\n\r\n[2858] Another reading is “Ictius,” but nothing is known of either.\r\n\r\n[2859] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2860] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2861] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2862] See end of B. ii. and end of B. xviii.\r\n\r\n[2863] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2864] See end of B. xvi.\r\n\r\n[2865] See end of B. ii. and end of B. xviii.\r\n\r\n[2866] See end of B. vi.\r\n\r\n[2867] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2868] See end of B. xvi.\r\n\r\n[2869] See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2870] See end of B. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[2871] See end of B. v.\r\n\r\n[2872] See end of B. viii.\r\n\r\n[2873] All that we know of him is, that he wrote on Precious Stones.\r\nApollonius Dyscolus mentions an author who wrote on the same subject,\r\nwhose name was “Tacus;” and possibly the same person is meant.\r\n\r\n[2874] Mentioned in this and the next Book, as a writer on Precious\r\nStones.\r\n\r\n[2875] Cornelius Alexander. See end of B. iii.\r\n\r\n[2876] See end of B. xxx.\r\n\r\n[2877] See end of B. xx.\r\n\r\n[2878] See end of B. vii.\r\n\r\n[2879] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2880] A Sicilian author of the time of Alexander. In his “Sacred\r\nHistory,” he interpreted the legends of the popular religion as based\r\nupon historical facts, and taught that the gods of Mythology were\r\nonly deified men. His system has been compared with the rationalism\r\nof some German theologians, and Euhemerists were still to be found at\r\nthe close of last century. Diodorus Siculus, Polybius, and Dionysius\r\nof Halicarnassus have followed in his track; and the poet Ennius\r\ntranslated his work, which is now lost.\r\n\r\n[2881] A Greek writer on Egypt. He is often quoted by Stephanus\r\nByzantinus, who says that he was not much younger than Plato. He is\r\nmentioned as a writer on the Pyramids of Egypt, in Chapter 17 of this\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[2882] See end of B. xii.\r\n\r\n[2883] See end of B. ii.\r\n\r\n[2884] From the mention made of him in Chapter 17 of this Book, he must\r\nhave lived in the first century before, or the first century after\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\n[2885] Possibly Antisthenes of Rhodes, a historian who lived about 200\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\n[2886] Possibly the author mentioned by Athenæus, B. xv. as having\r\nwritten on Egypt. He is mentioned in Chapter 17 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2887] Hardouin thinks that he is the same person as Hermateles,\r\nmentioned by Tertullian, _De Spectaculis_, c. 8, as having written on\r\nObelisks.\r\n\r\n[2888] A native of Naucratis, in Egypt, who wrote a work on that\r\ncountry, mentioned by Athenæus, and some Poems.\r\n\r\n[2889] In B. xxxiii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2890] This being imposed as a punishment on him, in remembrance of his\r\nsacrilegious crimes, when released by Jupiter from the rock. Prometheus\r\nand Vulcan, as Ajasson remarks, are personifications of fire, employed\r\nfor artistic purposes.\r\n\r\n[2891] See B. xxxiii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[2892] For ultimately, Oroetes, the satrap of Sardes, contrived to\r\nallure him into his power, and had him crucified, B.C. 522. Fuller,\r\nin his _Worthies_, p. 370, tells a very similar story of the loss and\r\nrecovery of his ring by one Anderson, a merchant of Newcastle-on-Tyne;\r\nand Zuinglius gives a similar statement with reference to Arnulph, duke\r\nof Lorraine, who dropped his ring into the Moselle, and recovered it\r\nfrom the belly of a fish.\r\n\r\n[2893] See Chapter 23. According to Herodotus, Pausanias, Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassus, and Suidas, the stone was an emerald; and Lessing thinks\r\nthat there was no figure engraved on it. See Chapter 4 of this Book.\r\nWithout vouching for the truth of it, we give the following extract\r\nfrom the _London Journal_, Vol. xxiii. No. 592. “A vine-dresser of\r\nAlbano, near Rome, is said to have found in a vineyard, the celebrated\r\nring of Polycrates.—The stone is of considerable size, and oblong in\r\nform. The engraving on it, by Theodore of Samos, the son of Talikles,\r\nis of extraordinary fineness and beauty. It represents a lyre, with\r\nthree bees flying about; below, on the right, a dolphin; on the left,\r\nthe head of a bull. The name of the engraver is inscribed in Greek\r\ncharacters. The upper surface of the stone is slightly concave, not\r\nhighly polished, and one corner broken. It is asserted that the\r\npossessor has been offered 50,000 dollars for it.”\r\n\r\n[2894] “Achates.” A variegated chalcedony. It was probably what is\r\ncalled, from its radiated streaks, a _fortification agate_. See Chapter\r\n54 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2895] Ajasson remarks that there can be little doubt that Nature had\r\nat least been very extensively seconded by Art.\r\n\r\n[2896] “Choraules.” One who accompanies the chorus on the pipe or flute.\r\n\r\n[2897] “Smaragdus.”\r\n\r\n[2898] One of the Danaïdes.\r\n\r\n[2899] This is said with reference to the one in the Temple of Concord,\r\nmentioned in Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n[2900] But see Exodus xxvii. 9, _et seq._, where it is shown that the\r\npractice existed many hundreds of years before.\r\n\r\n[2901] See B. vii. c. 38; where marble is the substance named. There\r\nare still two gems in existence said to have been engraved by this\r\nartist; but by some they are thought to be spurious.\r\n\r\n[2902] There are many precious stones with his name, still extant: but\r\nonly six appear to have been really engraved by him.\r\n\r\n[2903] This signet is mentioned also by Plutarch and Valerius Maximus.\r\n\r\n[2904] See B. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[2905] The younger Africanus. This circumstance is mentioned in the\r\nEpitome of Livy, B. xlviii.\r\n\r\n[2906] See B. xxxiii. c. 5, and end of Book ix.\r\n\r\n[2907] In reference to the ambiguous part which he acted, Ajasson\r\nthinks, in the early part of his career.\r\n\r\n[2908] In reference to the story of Œdipus and the Sphinx.\r\n\r\n[2909] A Greek word, signifying a “repository of kings.”\r\n\r\n[2910] See B. xxxvi. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[2911] The sister of Augustus.\r\n\r\n[2912] See B. xxxiii c. 53.\r\n\r\n[2913] See B. xxxiv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[2914] “Acta.”\r\n\r\n[2915] Chapter 7.\r\n\r\n[2916] A.U.C. 693.\r\n\r\n[2917] 30th of September.\r\n\r\n[2918] “Alveum lusorium.”\r\n\r\n[2919] Probably meaning a shrine dedicated to the Muses.\r\n\r\n[2920] See B. ii. c. 78, and B. vii. c. 60.\r\n\r\n[2921] That of Africa.\r\n\r\n[2922] See B. vii. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[2923] As was the case, after the murder of Pompey in Egypt.\r\n\r\n[2924] Caligula.\r\n\r\n[2925] Modern writers differ as to the material of which these vessels\r\nwere composed. Some think that they were of variegated glass, and\r\nothers of onyx; but the more general opinion is, that they were\r\nChinese porcelain, and we have the line in Propertius, B. iv. El. 5,\r\nl. 26. “And murrhine vessels baked on Parthian hearths.” Ajasson is of\r\nopinion, from the description given by Pliny, that these vessels were\r\nmade of Fluor spar, or fluate of lime. “Myrrhine” is another reading of\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\n[2926] “Ante hos annos.” Sillig is of opinion that the reading here\r\nshould be “L. Annius,” and that L. Annius Bassus, who was Consul\r\nsuffectus in the year 70 A.D., is the person referred to; or possibly,\r\nT. Arrius Antoninus, who was Consul suffectus, A.D. 69.\r\n\r\n[2927] The Gardens of Nero, in the Fourteenth Region of the City.\r\n\r\n[2928] He had been formerly a sharer in the debaucheries of Nero.\r\nTacitus called him “Caius.”\r\n\r\n[2929] See B. vi. cc. 27, 28, 32.\r\n\r\n[2930] Ajasson is of opinion that this passage bears reference to\r\ncrystallization. Both he and Desfontaines see in the present Chapter\r\na very exact description of Fluor spar; and there is certainly great\r\ndifficulty in recognizing any affinity between murrhine vessels, as\r\nhere described, and porcelain.\r\n\r\n[2931] “Abacus.”\r\n\r\n[2932] In the preceding Chapter.\r\n\r\n[2933] Meaning that they are semitransparent, Ajasson thinks. One great\r\ncharacteristic of Fluor spar is its being subtranslucent.\r\n\r\n[2934] This would appear to be the meaning here of “sales.” See p. 396.\r\n\r\n[2935] One of the grounds, Ajasson says, on which may be based the\r\nopinion that they were artificial.\r\n\r\n[2936] Colourless crystals, quartz, or rock crystal; called “white\r\nstone” in jewellery.\r\n\r\n[2937] See B. xxxvi. c. 45. This was a very general opinion of the\r\nancients with respect to crystal.\r\n\r\n[2938] Κρύσταλλος, from κρύος, “cold.”\r\n\r\n[2939] See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2940] In Caria, see B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[2941] The Island “of the dead.” Brotero supposes it to be the island\r\nof Maceira.\r\n\r\n[2942] See B. vi. c. 34. As Ajasson remarks, there could be no snow or\r\nice here.\r\n\r\n[2943] See B. iv. c. 35.\r\n\r\n[2944] Dioscorides attributes the hardening of crystal to the action of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\n[2945] “Its shape is rhombohedral, and hemihedral in some of its\r\nmodifications. The planes on the angles between the prism and\r\npyramidal terminations, incline sometimes to the right, and sometimes\r\nto the left, and the crystals are termed right and left-handed\r\ncrystals.”—Dana, _System of Mineralogy_, Art. _Quartz_.\r\n\r\n[2946] Ajasson remarks that blocks have been found in Switzerland,\r\nweighing above eight hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n[2947] Forty-eight sextarii. See Introduction to Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[2948] This “vomica,” Ajasson says, is either water, azote, rarified\r\noxygen, or water in combination with naphtha.\r\n\r\n[2949] “Centra,” knots, or flaws. See B. xvi. c. 76, where he speaks of\r\nthe “centra” in marble. See also Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 471.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[2950] “Sale.” See Note 2934 above.\r\n\r\n[2951] “Without flaw.”\r\n\r\n[2952] See B. xxxvi. c. 67.\r\n\r\n[2953] “Succinum.” It is of vegetable origin, and, according to\r\nGöppert, was originally the viscous resin of a tree named by him\r\n_Pinites succinifer_.\r\n\r\n[2954] It is used by men, more particularly, at the present day, as a\r\nmouthpiece for pipes.\r\n\r\n[2955] As to the _vegetable_ origin of amber, there is no doubt that\r\nthe ancients were right.\r\n\r\n[2956] Most probably from ἥλιος, the “sun.” Phaëthon was\r\nfabled to have been the son of Apollo. See the story in Ovid’s Met. B.\r\nii. l. 340, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[2957] Where amber was not to be found.\r\n\r\n[2958] In reality, these “Amber Islands” were situate at the mouth of\r\nthe Vistula, into which the Radanus discharged itself; a river whose\r\nname was afterwards confounded with “Eridanus,” the ancient name of the\r\nPadus, or Po. See B. iv. cc. 27, 30, as to the produce of amber in the\r\nBaltic.\r\n\r\n[2959] Another reference to its vegetable origin.\r\n\r\n[2960] De Lapid. n. 53.\r\n\r\n[2961] In confirmation of this, Ajasson remarks that amber is found at\r\nSaint Paulet in the Department Du Gard, and at Aix, in the Department\r\nof Bouches-du-Rhône, regions not very distant from the territory of\r\nancient Liguria.\r\n\r\n[2962] It has been supposed by some that this in reality was\r\nTourmaline, and Woodward has identified it with Belemnites. See\r\nBeckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 86. _Bohn’s Edition._ See further as to\r\n“Lyncurium,” B. viii. c. 57, and Chapter 13 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[2963] See B. iv. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[2964] See B. iv. c. 27.\r\n\r\n[2965] Said in reference to the electric spark, Ajasson thinks.\r\n\r\n[2966] In Hebrew, this word means “a stone.”\r\n\r\n[2967] From the Greek ἁρπάζω, “to drag.”\r\n\r\n[2968] See B. x. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2969] All this is based, Ajasson thinks, upon the stories of Hindoo\r\nmythology.\r\n\r\n[2970] The old reading is “Osericta:” Ajasson identifies it with the\r\nisland of Oësel in the Baltic.\r\n\r\n[2971] See B. x. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[2972] See B. iv. cc. 27, 30, and the Notes.\r\n\r\n[2973] See B. iv. c. 30.\r\n\r\n[2974] It is just possible that the Pinites succinifer may have still\r\nexisted, to some extent, eighteen hundred years ago. See Note 2953 above.\r\n\r\n[2975] From “succus,” “juice.”\r\n\r\n[2976] Goitre, for example.\r\n\r\n[2977] The projecting part in the Circus or Amphitheatre, next the\r\narena, and immediately in front of the place occupied by the emperor\r\nand nobles.\r\n\r\n[2978] The knots, probably, were adorned with studs or buttons of amber.\r\n\r\n[2979] “Libitina.” Meaning the litters on which the slain gladiators\r\nwere carried away from the arena.\r\n\r\n[2980] Martial has three Epigrams on Insects enclosed in amber; B. iv.\r\nEp. 32 and 59, and B. vi. Ep. 15.\r\n\r\n[2981] These so-called kinds or varieties are mostly accidental\r\nvariations only in appearance.\r\n\r\n[2982] Which is perceptible on its being rubbed: in some cases the\r\nodour of amber is very fine, in others it is perfectly fetid; though in\r\nthe latter case, as Ajasson remarks, it is doubtful whether it may be\r\nconsidered to be genuine amber.\r\n\r\n[2983] “Lini.” Salmasius suggests “pini,” “pith of pine.”\r\n\r\n[2984] “Golden amber.” Brotero thinks that this must have been Hyacinth\r\nor Zirconite of a yellowish white colour. Ajasson says that the\r\ndescription would equally apply to Idocrase, Meionite, or Harmotome.\r\n\r\n[2985] See Note 2962, above. Brotero identifies it with orange-coloured\r\nHyacinth; Ajasson and Desfontaines with Tourmaline. Ajasson suggests,\r\nalso, that the first syllabic in its name—_Lync_, may have been derived\r\nfrom the Sanscrit _Lanka_, the name of Ceylon, one of the localities\r\nwhere the Tourmaline is chiefly found.\r\n\r\n[2986] Ajasson thinks that Rubellite or Red Tourmaline is here alluded\r\nto.\r\n\r\n[2987] This is the case with tourmaline when subjected to heat.\r\n\r\n[2988] We may here remark, that throughout this Book, in all cases\r\nwhere there is any doubt as to the identification of the substance,\r\nthe ancient name is retained. Hence our words “adamant” and “diamond.”\r\nIf Pliny means the latter, which is doubtful, it still maintains the\r\nrank here assigned to it. The word “adamas” is supposed to be derived\r\nfrom the Greek ἀ, privative, and δαμάω, “to subdue,”\r\nit being supposed to be invincible by fire. The diamond is pure carbon\r\ncrystallized, and is thought to have been of vegetable origin. Dana has\r\nthe following remarks upon the word “adamas.”—“This name was applied\r\nby the ancients to several minerals differing much in their physical\r\nproperties. A few of these are quartz, specular iron ore, emery, and\r\nother substances of rather high degrees of hardness, which cannot now\r\nbe identified. It is doubtful whether Pliny had any acquaintance with\r\nthe real diamond.”—_System of Mineralogy_, Art. _Diamond_. We may also\r\nadd, from the same authority, that the method of polishing diamonds\r\nwas first discovered in 1456, by Louis Berquen, a citizen of Bruges,\r\nprevious to which time the diamond was only known in its native uncut\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n[2989] This statement cannot apply to the “diamond” as known to us,\r\nthough occasionally grains of gold have been found in the vicinity of\r\nthe diamond.\r\n\r\n[2990] Ajasson is of opinion that the Æthiopia here mentioned is in\r\nreality India, and that the “Temple of Mercury” means the _Brahmaloka_,\r\nor Temple of Brahma.\r\n\r\n[2991] The diamond, as known to us, is octahedral.\r\n\r\n[2992] Though found in comparative abundance in India, the diamond is\r\nnot found in Arabia.\r\n\r\n[2993] This is not the case with the diamond; for on being struck under\r\nsuch circumstances, it will break.\r\n\r\n[2994] In reality, the diamond will burn, and, at a temperature of 14°\r\nWedgewood, is wholly consumed, producing carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n[2995] See Note 2988, above.\r\n\r\n[2996] “Millet-seed.”\r\n\r\n[2997] Ajasson says, that no doubt this adamas was Adamantine, or\r\nlimpid Corundum.\r\n\r\n[2998] Ajasson suggests that this may have been Dichroite, or\r\nCordierite, known also as Iolite, or Water sapphire.\r\n\r\n[2999] Possibly the Siderite, sparry iron, or spathic iron of modern\r\nMineralogy. Ajasson is inclined to think that it is Corundum, of a dark\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n[3000] See B. xx. c. 1, B. xxviii. cc. 23, 41, and B. xxxii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[3001] Brotero thinks that this was a story invented by the dealers,\r\nwith a view of concealing the real method of breaking the stone.\r\n\r\n[3002] Said, probably, with reference to the rank, nauseous smell of\r\nthe he-goat.\r\n\r\n[3003] This is true with reference to the diamond, and, in a less\r\ndegree, several other crystalline substances, emery and quartz, for\r\nexample.\r\n\r\n[3004] Ajasson remarks, that if the diamond is placed in the magnetic\r\nline or current of the loadstone, it attracts iron equally with the\r\nloadstone, and consequently neutralizes the attractive power of the\r\nloadstone in a considerable degree.\r\n\r\n[3005] The reading is very doubtful here. This word, as it is here\r\ngiven, would appear to be derived from the Greek ἀ privative,\r\nand ἄγχομαι, “to strangle oneself,” and to mean, “preventive\r\nof suicide.”\r\n\r\n[3006] See B. iv. c. 27, and Chapter 11 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3007] At the present day the ruby is next in esteem to the diamond.\r\n\r\n[3008] Chapter 54, _et seq._\r\n\r\n[3009] The Emerald, and various other green precious stones, were\r\nincluded under this name.\r\n\r\n[3010] “Virentes” seems a very preferable reading to “silentes,” as\r\ngiven by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[3011] The emerald is supposed to derive this colour from a minute\r\nportion of oxide of chrome.\r\n\r\n[3012] Engraved emeralds are but seldom found among collections of\r\nancient gems. In 1593, there was one found in the tomb of Maria,\r\ndaughter of Stilicho, in the Vatican, with the head of Honorius, her\r\nhusband, engraved upon it.\r\n\r\n[3013] “It may here be objected that real emeralds are too small\r\nto admit of being used as mirrors; but the ancients speak of some\r\nsufficiently large for that purpose, and also of artificial ones;\r\nso that we may with certainty conclude, that they classed among the\r\nemeralds fluor spar, green vitrified lava, or the green Icelandic\r\nagate, as it is called, green jasper, and also green glass.”—Beckmann,\r\nHist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 67. _Bohn’s Edition._ It has also been\r\nsuggested, with reference to this passage, that Nero was short-sighted,\r\nand that this emerald was formed like a concave lens. The passage,\r\nhowever, will hardly support such a construction. Ajasson thinks that\r\nit must have been a Dioptase or Siberian emerald; or else a green\r\nCorundum.\r\n\r\n[3014] Ajasson is of opinion that the Dioptase, Siberian emerald, or\r\nMalachite emerald is meant.\r\n\r\n[3015] Ajasson thinks that this may be the Dioptase or Achirite of\r\nChinese Bucharia; and that the merchant Achir Mahmed, from whom it\r\ntakes its name, was by no means the first to introduce it, or to\r\ncirculate his wonderful stories as to its formation.\r\n\r\n[3016] See B. ii. cc. 47, 48, and B. xviii. c. 74.\r\n\r\n[3017] Mount Zalora. in Upper Egypt, still produces emeralds, and was\r\nprobably the only locality of the _genuine_ stone that was known to the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\n[3018] “Cetarias.”\r\n\r\n[3019] Ajasson remarks that the greater part of the defects here\r\ndescribed belong in reality to the Dioptase.\r\n\r\n[3020] “Sal.” See Chapters 8, 10, 22, and 37, of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3021] Ajasson is of opinion that Diallage is here meant, known also by\r\nthe names of Bronzite, schillerspath, schillerstein, and omphasite.\r\n\r\n[3022] See B. iv. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[3023] “In sole” seems a preferable reading to “in solo,” “on the\r\nground,” as given by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[3024] See Chapter 39 of this Book; where it will be shown that this\r\nprobably is not the modern Sapphire.\r\n\r\n[3025] Ajasson suggests that these may have been Quartz agates of the\r\ndendritic or arborized kind.\r\n\r\n[3026] He probably alludes here to some variety of the Chalcedony or\r\nOpal quartz.\r\n\r\n[3027] Said with reference to Chrysoprase, Ajasson thinks; a leek-green\r\nchalcedony, coloured by nickel.\r\n\r\n[3028] Probably the Cacholong of modern mineralogy, a variety of opal,\r\nnearly opaque, and of a porcelain or bluish white colour.\r\n\r\n[3029] Ajasson and Brotero identify this with milk-white chalcedony;\r\nbut on what authority, does not appear.\r\n\r\n[3030] See B. iv. c. 8.\r\n\r\n[3031] Supposed by Ajasson to be the Euclase, a brittle green stone,\r\ncomposed of silica, alumina, and glucina. Haüy gave it this name from\r\nthe Greek words εὖ, “easily” and κλάω, “to break.” According to Dana,\r\nhowever, Euclase was first brought from Peru: if such is the fact, we\r\nmust, perhaps, look for its identification in Epidote, a green silicate\r\nof alumina.\r\n\r\n[3032] “Brazen smaragdus.” It was probably Dioptase, combined with\r\ncopper Pyrites. See Notes 3013, 3014, and 3015, above.\r\n\r\n[3033] With reference to this statement and the others in this Chapter,\r\nAjasson remarks that these stones can have been nothing but prases,\r\ngreen jaspers, fusible spaths, emerald quartz, and fluates of lime.\r\n\r\n[3034] Herodotus mentions this smaragdus and the temple, B. ii. c. 44,\r\nas having been seen by himself.\r\n\r\n[3035] “Iaspis.” See Chapter 37 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3036] Meaning “the conqueror of many,” probably; in reference to his\r\ncontentious disposition. See end of B. xxx.\r\n\r\n[3037] The Beryl and the Emerald are only varieties of the same\r\nspecies, the latter owing its colour to oxide of chrome, the former to\r\noxide of iron.\r\n\r\n[3038] The best Beryls are found in Siberia, Hindostan, Brazil, and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[3039] The crystals are naturally hexagonal.\r\n\r\n[3040] Hence the name of the sky-blue, or mountain-green beryl,\r\n_aquamarine_.\r\n\r\n[3041] Or “golden beryl,” The modern Chrysoberyl is altogether a\r\ndifferent stone from the one here described, which probably is\r\nidentical with Chrysoprase or leek-green Chalcedony, the stone next\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[3042] “Leek-green and gold.”\r\n\r\n[3043] “Sky-coloured.”\r\n\r\n[3044] The largest specimen of Beryl known, belonged to Don Pedro. It\r\nwas not cylindrical in form, but shaped like the head of a calf, and\r\nweighed 225 ounces troy.\r\n\r\n[3045] Which is the case.\r\n\r\n[3046] In Chapter 18 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3047] “Pterygia.”\r\n\r\n[3048] In the Uralian Mountains, for example.\r\n\r\n[3049] Opals are hydrated silica, the amount of water varying.\r\n\r\n[3050] On the contrary, precious Opal is found in Hungary, at\r\nFrankfort, and in Honduras, and other varieties in numerous parts of\r\nthe world, including the East Indies.\r\n\r\n[3051] See Chapter 25 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3052] See B. xxxv. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[3053] The largest opal known is in the Imperial cabinet at Vienna.\r\nIt is the size of a man’s fist, and weighs 17 ounces, but is full of\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\n[3054] See Carm. 53 of the Poems of Catullus.\r\n\r\n[3055] A.U.C. 788.\r\n\r\n[3056] See B. viii. c. 47. He alludes to the story of the Beaver.\r\n\r\n[3057] See B. xxii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[3058] This is the case with _common_ opal, as distinguished from\r\n_precious_ opal.\r\n\r\n[3059] “Lovely youth.”\r\n\r\n[3060] Said ironically. There is a somewhat similar remark in B.\r\nxxxiii. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[3061] A mixture of brown-red and white chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[3062] From the Greek Σάρδιον, “sard,” and ὄνυξ, a “finger nail.”\r\n\r\n[3063] His meaning seems to be that it does not present the bright\r\ntransparent red of the Indian Sarda or Carnelian. See Chapter 31 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[3064] “Quâdam spe.” _Un soupçon_, as the French would say.\r\n\r\n[3065] This would appear, from the description, to be an Agate, or\r\nvariegated Chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[3066] He probably intends to include the Sarda or Carnelian here.\r\n\r\n[3067] A variety, probably, of common Chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[3068] See B. ix. cc. 74, 88, and B. xxxii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[3069] “Fæculentæ,” of the colour of wine-lees.\r\n\r\n[3070] So called from ὄνυξ, a “finger-nail.” It is a variety\r\nof the Chalcedony, resembling Agate, but the colours are arranged in\r\nflat horizontal planes.\r\n\r\n[3071] See B. xxxiv. c. 22, and B. xxxvi. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[3072] It is pretty clear that the Onyx of Pliny included not only our\r\nOnyx, but several other varieties of the Chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[3073] “Igniculos.”\r\n\r\n[3074] “Carnosas.” It is somewhat doubtful whether our Carnelian,\r\nor Cornelian, take its name from this word, or from “cornus,” a\r\ncornel-berry.\r\n\r\n[3075] See Chapter 31.\r\n\r\n[3076] Literally meaning a “red-hot coal.” The carbunculus of Pliny is\r\nsupposed to include not only the red, or Iron and Iron-lime garnet, but\r\nthe Spinelle ruby also, or Oriental ruby.\r\n\r\n[3077] There is some truth in this, as some few kinds both of the\r\nGarnet and Ruby are infusible. Of the ruby, the red varieties change\r\nto brown, black, and opaque even, as the temperature increases, and on\r\ncooling become first green, and then nearly colourless, but at last\r\nresume their red colour.\r\n\r\n[3078] From the Greek; meaning “incombustible.”\r\n\r\n[3079] From Καρχήδων, the Greek name for Carthage.\r\n\r\n[3080] Carthago Magna, so called in contradistinction to Carthage Nova,\r\nor New Carthage, in Spain.\r\n\r\n[3081] See B. v. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[3082] In the vicinity of Orthosia. It is from this place that one kind\r\nof garnet is now called “Almandine.” There is also the Almandine, or\r\nviolet-coloured ruby. Sec Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. II. p. 238. _Bohn’s\r\nEdition._ It is probable that Carthage was the great entrepôt for the\r\ncarbunculi of the Garamantes and Æthiopia, where Red sapphire, Red\r\ncorundum, or Oriental ruby, was probably found.\r\n\r\n[3083] A variety, perhaps, of Iron garnet, or Iron-lime garnet.\r\n\r\n[3084] Desfontaines suggests that this may have been the Balas ruby, or\r\npossibly the Syrian Garnet, of a violet purple colour. Not improbably\r\nit is the Almandine ruby.\r\n\r\n[3085] “Pinnato fulgore.” This mottled appearance is to be seen in the\r\ninterior of some red garnets.\r\n\r\n[3086] Common garnets, probably.\r\n\r\n[3087] Sillig suggests that this may be from λιγνὺς, “soot.”\r\nThe reading, however, is extremely doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3088] See Introduction to Vol. III. If this is the truth, they were\r\nmade of some of the crystals of the garnet, probably.\r\n\r\n[3089] De Lapid. see 61.\r\n\r\n[3090] “Pliny has here committed a gross mistake, which has not been\r\nobserved by Hardouin. Theophrastus, in the passage alluded to, does not\r\nspeak of a ruby, but the well-known black marble of Chio; though he\r\ncalls both _carbunculus_, a name given to the ruby, on account of its\r\nlikeness to a burning coal, and to the black marble on account of its\r\nresemblance to a quenched coal or cinder; and the latter, as well as\r\nthe Obsidian stone, was sometimes used for mirrors.”—Beckmann, Hist.\r\nInv. Vol. II. pp. 67, 68. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[3091] “Illos.” He should have said “hos”—“the latter.”\r\n\r\n[3092] See B. iv. c. 35; the present Lisbon.\r\n\r\n[3093] Dalechamps thinks that this is the same as the “anthracites”\r\nmentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 38, and identifies it either with our\r\nAnthracite, or else with pit-coal or bituminous coal. It is much more\r\nlikely, however, that a precious stone is meant; and, in conformity\r\nwith this opinion, Brotero and Ajasson have identified it with the\r\nSpinelle or scarlet Ruby, and the Balas or rose-red ruby, magnesiates\r\nof alumina.\r\n\r\n[3094] Sec B. iv. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[3095] “Carbo.” This word may mean either a “burning coal” or\r\n“charcoal” hence the confusion that has arisen in identifying the\r\nmineral substance that is meant.\r\n\r\n[3096] See Note 3077, to Chapter 25.\r\n\r\n[3097] “Sandaresus” and “Sandasiros” are other readings. This stone has\r\nnot been identified, but Ajasson is inclined to think that it may have\r\nbeen Aventurine quartz, and is the more inclined to this opinion, as\r\nthat mineral is found in Persia, and _sandastra_ or _tchandastra_ is\r\npurely a Sanscrit word. The description, however, would hardly seem to\r\napply to Aventurine.\r\n\r\n[3098] Littré suggests that the reading here probably might be “ob id\r\n_non_ magno”—“sell _not_ so dear.”\r\n\r\n[3099] It has not been identified.\r\n\r\n[3100] From λυχνὸς, a “lighted lamp” or “torch.” Brotero is\r\nof opinion that this is the Cherry-coloured ruby, that the Ionian\r\nstone is the Purple ruby, and that the kermes-berry coloured stone is\r\nthe Scarlet or Spinelle ruby. From the distinct reference made to its\r\nelectric nature, Ajasson identifies it with Tourmaline, a Silicate of\r\nalumina. Beckmann is of the same opinion; Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 88.\r\n_Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[3101] “Remissiorem.”\r\n\r\n[3102] See B. xxi. cc. 33, 39, where the “Flos Jovis” is mentioned in\r\njuxtaposition with the flower called “lychnis,” either the Umbel’d\r\nCampion rose, or the Common red rose Campion.\r\n\r\n[3103] “Coccum.” “Kermes-berry coloured.” These kinds probably were,\r\nIndicolite or Blue tourmaline, and Rubellite or Red tourmaline.\r\n\r\n[3104] As Beckmann remarks, he should have said that it first attracts,\r\nand then repels them; such being the case with Tourmaline.\r\n\r\n[3105] Not identical, most probably, with the Carchedonian or\r\nCarthaginian stone mentioned in Chapter 25, which was probably a garnet\r\nor a ruby. Ajasson has no doubt that it is identical with jasper\r\nquartz, including the varieties called Striped or Riband jasper, and\r\nEgyptian jasper.\r\n\r\n[3106] See B. v. c. 5, and B. vii. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[3107] Tourmaline, probably, in combination with other mineral\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n[3108] Carnelian, a variety of Chalcedony. It is originally grey, or\r\ngreyish red, which afterwards turns to a rich, deep, red, on exposure\r\nto the sun’s rays, and subsequently to artificial heat.\r\n\r\n[3109] Which supplies the best carnelians at the present day.\r\n\r\n[3110] From their mixture, Ajasson says, with argillaceous earth.\r\n\r\n[3111] Under this name Pliny evidently speaks of the stone known to us\r\nas Chrysolite, and possibly of green agate as well. Our Topaz cannot be\r\neasily recognized in this Chapter, at all events.\r\n\r\n[3112] See B. vi. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[3113] See B. vi. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[3114] Τοπάζω in Greek, signifies “to conjecture.”\r\n\r\n[3115] It was agate, most probably.\r\n\r\n[3116] “Leek-green.” Ajasson and Desfontaines think that this must have\r\nbeen either Oriental Chrysolite or Oriental Peridote.\r\n\r\n[3117] Some would identify this with Oriental topaz or yellow corundum,\r\na variety of the Sapphire; while others would see in it the genuine\r\nTopaz; and others, again, think it synonymous with the Chrysoprase. The\r\nname “chrysopteron” means “golden-wing.”\r\n\r\n[3118] “Leek-green and gold.” An apple or leek-green Chalcedony,\r\ncoloured by nickel. See Chapters 20, 34, and 73, of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3119] See B. xxxvi. c. 10.\r\n\r\n[3120] Dana thinks this identical with the Turquois. Ajasson and\r\nDesfontaines identify it with Oriental Peridote.\r\n\r\n[3121] Turquois is found in large quantities in a mountainous district\r\nof Persia, not far from Nichabour; where it occurs in veins which\r\ntraverse the mountains in all directions.\r\n\r\n[3122] Isidorus says, B. xvi. c. 17, that they wore it in the ears.\r\nThe Shah of Persia, it is said, retains for his own use all the larger\r\nand more finely tinted specimens of turquois that are found in his\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n[3123] This story is now regarded as fabulous.\r\n\r\n[3124] See B. x. cc. 44, 79.\r\n\r\n[3125] The stone now known as “Prase” is a vitreous, leek-green,\r\nvariety of massive quartz.\r\n\r\n[3126] This may possibly have been Plasma, a faintly translucent\r\nChalcedony, approaching jasper, having a greenish colour, sprinkled\r\nwith yellow and whitish dots, and a glistening lustre. Or, perhaps,\r\nBloodstone or Heliotrope, a kind of jasper.\r\n\r\n[3127] See the preceding Chapter, and Note 3118.\r\n\r\n[3128] “Cymbia.” Drinking vessels shaped like a boat.\r\n\r\n[3129] Or “Nile-stone.” Egyptian jasper, or Egyptian pebble, a kind of\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\n[3130] Our Malachite, a green carbonate of copper. See B. xxxiii. c. 26.\r\n\r\n[3131] Called μολόχη or μαλάχη in Greek.\r\n\r\n[3132] Also of Siberia, Shetland, the United States, and numerous other\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n[3133] Meadow-green jasper.\r\n\r\n[3134] Salmasius erroneously takes this to be the Turquoise. It is our\r\nsky-blue jasper, no doubt. See Beckmann, Hist. Inv. Vol. I. p. 471,\r\n_Bohn’s Edition_.\r\n\r\n[3135] See B. vi. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[3136] The Bamberg MS. gives “Calchedon” here.\r\n\r\n[3137] Namely, πορφυρίζουσα, ῥοδίζουσα, and σμαραγδίζουσα.\r\n\r\n[3138] “Northern,” apparently.\r\n\r\n[3139] “Sky-blue,” mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[3140] See Chapter 31. Red jasper, or perhaps Red porphyry.\r\n\r\n[3141] “Aut” appeals to be a preferable reading to the “ut” of the\r\nBamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[3142] See B. xv. cc. 12, 13.\r\n\r\n[3143] “Terebinthizusa.” Yellow jasper, Ajasson says.\r\n\r\n[3144] See Chapter 18 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3145] “Seal-stone.” A kind of carnelian, probably.\r\n\r\n[3146] “Publico gemmarum dominio iis tantum dato, quoniam optime\r\nsignent.” The above is the sense given to the passage by Holland,\r\nAjasson, and Littré; but another translation may also be suggested—“A\r\nstone to which alone, by general consent, is awarded the custody of\r\nprecious stones, from the fact that it makes the best impression\r\nas a seal.” In reference to the custom of putting a seal on the\r\ndactyliothecæ, or jewel-caskets. See page 80 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3147] “Single-lined.”\r\n\r\n[3148] “Many-lined.”\r\n\r\n[3149] Albertus Magnus, De Mineral. B. ii., has several other stories\r\nrespecting it of a similar nature.\r\n\r\n[3150] Jasper onyx.\r\n\r\n[3151] Identified by Ajasson with snow-flake chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[3152] Spotted jasper onyx.\r\n\r\n[3153] See B. xxxi. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[3154] Smoked jasper onyx.\r\n\r\n[3155] It is still used for making vases, boxes, knife-handles, and\r\nother articles, and is much used in the manufacture of Florentine\r\nmosaics. We may also remark, that the “iaspis” of Pliny probably\r\nincluded some stones not of the jasper kind.\r\n\r\n[3156] “Azure stone;” generally supposed to have been a species of\r\nLapis lazuli or azure. Beckmann is of opinion that it was a mineral or\r\nmountain blue, tinged with copper.\r\n\r\n[3157] It is found in China, Persia, Siberia, and Bucharia.\r\n\r\n[3158] Ultramarine is prepared from Lapis lazuli, and an artificial\r\nkind is extensively in use, which equals the native in permanency and\r\nbrilliancy of colour, and is very extensively employed in the arts.\r\nTheophrastus, De Lapid. sec. 55, speaks of this artificial ultramarine.\r\n\r\n[3159] This must not be taken for the Sapphire of the present day, but\r\nwas most probably Lapis lazuli, and identical, perhaps, with Cyanos.\r\nBeckmann has devoted considerable attention to this subject; Hist. Inv.\r\nVol. I. pp. 468-473. _Bohn’s Edition._\r\n\r\n[3160] Particles of iron pyrites, probably, which are frequently to be\r\nseen in Lapis lazuli.\r\n\r\n[3161] Quartz, probably, according to some authorities.\r\n\r\n[3162] So called, according to some authorities, from ἀ, “not,” μεθύω,\r\n“to intoxicate,” on account of its being a supposed preservative\r\nagainst inebriety. Ajasson is of opinion that Pliny does not here\r\nspeaks of the Quartz Amethyst of modern mineralogy, but only the\r\nOriental Amethyst, violet Sapphire, or violet Corundum. It is not\r\nimprobable, however, that he includes them all, as well as violet Fluor\r\nspar, and some other purple stones; inclusive, possibly, of the Garnet.\r\n\r\n[3163] He is probably speaking _here_ of violet Fluor spar; Oriental\r\namethyst, or violet sapphire, it is next to impossible to engrave.\r\n\r\n[3164] See B. ix. c. 62.\r\n\r\n[3165] The city of Pharan, mentioned by St. Jerome and Eusebius.\r\n\r\n[3166] “In suspectu.” See B. xxi. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[3167] “Lovely youth.” The Opal has been thus called in Chapter 22.\r\n\r\n[3168] “Avenger of slighted love.”\r\n\r\n[3169] “Veneris gena;” called in Greek “Aphrodites blepharon.”\r\n\r\n[3170] Which is most probable; however untrue the story itself may be.\r\nSee Note 3162 above.\r\n\r\n[3171] A kind of Baboon. See B. vi. c. 35, B. vii. c. 2, and B. viii.\r\nc. 80.\r\n\r\n[3172] It is considered very doubtful whether the modern Hyacinth or\r\nZircon is one of the number of stones that were called “Hyacinthus” by\r\nthe ancients. Jameson appears to have thought that they gave this name\r\nto the oriental amethyst or violet sapphire.\r\n\r\n[3173] See B. xxi. c. 38.\r\n\r\n[3174] Generally supposed to be the Oriental topaz, yellow Sapphire\r\nor yellow Corundum. We have already seen, in Chapter 32, that the\r\n“Topazos” of the ancients was in all probability the modern Chrysolite.\r\n\r\n[3175] In Pontus: see B. vi. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[3176] See B. xxxiv. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[3177] Supposed to be yellow-white Hyacinth. See Chapter 12 of this\r\nBook.\r\n\r\n[3178] “Electrum.”\r\n\r\n[3179] See Chapter 76 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3180] See Chapter 9 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3181] Yellow quartz crystal probably, or False topaz.\r\n\r\n[3182] “White gold stone.” It has not been identified.\r\n\r\n[3183] “Smoke-stone.” A jasper has been so called in Chapter 37.\r\n\r\n[3184] “Honey gold stone.” Some are of opinion that this was the\r\nHoney-coloured Hyacinth. Others, again, identify it with the yellow,\r\nhoney-coloured Topaz; an opinion with which Ajasson coincides.\r\n\r\n[3185] “Xanthon” is another reading. See Chapter 60 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3186] “Lovely youth.” See Chapter 22, where it has been already\r\nmentioned. He here reverts to the Opals.\r\n\r\n[3187] See Chapter 40, for example, where it is given to a variety of\r\nthe Amethyst.\r\n\r\n[3188] The Opal, which he is about to describe.\r\n\r\n[3189] See Chapter 18 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3190] The vitreous Asteriated crystals of Sapphire are still called by\r\nthis name. Ajasson, however, and Desfontaines, identify this gem with\r\nGirasol opal or fire opal. See Note 3147.\r\n\r\n[3191] From ἀστερ, a star.\r\n\r\n[3192] “Star-stone.” Ajasson identifies this stone with the Asteriated\r\nSapphire or Corundum, mentioned in Note 3190 above.\r\n\r\n[3193] See B. iv. cc. 10, 17.\r\n\r\n[3194] “Lightning darting.”\r\n\r\n[3195] “Star-like.” Ajasson thinks, that it is identical with the stone\r\nnext mentioned.\r\n\r\n[3196] “Planet-stricken.” It is not improbable that this was Cat’s-eye,\r\na translucent Chalcedony, presenting a peculiar opalescence, or\r\ninternal reflections, when cut _en cabochon_. The colour is either\r\nbright-greenish grey, or else yellow, red, or brownish.\r\n\r\n[3197] See Note 3194 above. Parisot thinks that these must have been\r\nAërolites or Meteorites.\r\n\r\n[3198] Brotero thinks that these were petrified shells, to which the\r\nmagicians imputed marvellous properties.\r\n\r\n[3199] Brotero is of opinion that those were Belemnites, more commonly\r\nknown as “thunderstones.” The reading “bætyli” is doubtful; but\r\nParisot says, on what authority does not appear, that “Betylus” meant\r\n“Great father,” and that this name, as well as “Abaddir” of similar\r\nsignification, was given by magicians to aërolites or meteorites used\r\nin their enchantments.\r\n\r\n[3200] A meteoric stone or aërolite, evidently.\r\n\r\n[3201] “Rainbow.” Opinion seems divided as to whether this is Hyalin\r\nquartz iridized internally, or prismatic crystals of Limpid quartz,\r\nwhich decompose the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n[3202] The reading and meaning of this passage are very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3203] The reading is doubtful, “zeros” and “erros” being given by\r\nsome MSS. Ajasson hazards a conjecture that it may have been a variety\r\nof quartz, formed of a concretion of agates united by a cement of a\r\nsimilar nature.\r\n\r\n[3204] A general name for Agate, and possibly some other stones not now\r\nincluded under the name.\r\n\r\n[3205] “Jasper agate.”\r\n\r\n[3206] “Wax agate.” The modern Orange agate, probably.\r\n\r\n[3207] “Smaragdus agate.” Emerald-coloured agate.\r\n\r\n[3208] “Blood agate.” Agate sprinkled with spots of red jasper.\r\n\r\n[3209] “White agate.”\r\n\r\n[3210] “Tree agate.” Moss agate or Mocha stone, coloured by oxide of\r\niron.\r\n\r\n[3211] Probably the reading should be “Stactachates,” “Myrrh agate.”\r\n\r\n[3212] “Coralline agate.” See Chapter 56.\r\n\r\n[3213] Undulated agate.\r\n\r\n[3214] Moss agate, probably. See Note 3210 above.\r\n\r\n[3215] Sillig is of opinion that the reading here is corrupt.\r\n\r\n[3216] “Coticulas.” Stones for grinding drugs.\r\n\r\n[3217] “Refreshing” stone. Hardly any of these stones appear to be\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n[3218] As to the “nitrum” of Pliny, see B. xxxi. c. 46.\r\n\r\n[3219] Probably the same as the Alabastrites of B. xxxv. c. 12.\r\n\r\n[3220] From the Greek, ἀλέκτωρ, a “cock.”\r\n\r\n[3221] See B. vii. c. 19.\r\n\r\n[3222] “Man-subduing.” Identified by some with Marcasite, or White iron\r\npyrites.\r\n\r\n[3223] See Chapter 15 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3224] “Silver-subduing.”\r\n\r\n[3225] “Counteracting-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3226] Probably the stone mentioned in B. xxxvi. c. 41.\r\n\r\n[3227] “Aromatic stone.” Cæsalpinus is of opinion that this is grey or\r\nclouded amber.\r\n\r\n[3228] “Reginis.”\r\n\r\n[3229] See B. xix. c. 4, and B. xxxvi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[3230] The reading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3231] Called “melancoryphi” in Chapter 33.\r\n\r\n[3232] Ajasson thinks that the reading should be “Aeizoe,” from the\r\nGreek ἀειζώη, “long lived.”\r\n\r\n[3233] “Shining stone,” apparently.\r\n\r\n[3234] See Chapter 33 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3235] The reading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3236] See B. xxxiii. c. 2: where a fossil Chrysocolla is also\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n[3237] See B. xi. c. 36, and B. xxxiii. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[3238] “Gem of Aphrodite” or “Venus.” Thought by Dalechamps and\r\nHardouin to have been a kind of agate.\r\n\r\n[3239] “Which never grows cold.”\r\n\r\n[3240] A kind of Onyx, Dalechamps thinks.\r\n\r\n[3241] “Acorn stone.” Like an olive in appearance, and now known as\r\n“Jew stone,” probably, a fossil.\r\n\r\n[3242] “Frog-stone.” Varieties of quartz, probably.\r\n\r\n[3243] “Dipped stone.” Dalechamps says that it was amber stained with\r\nalkanet, but on what authority does not appear.\r\n\r\n[3244] “Eye of Belus.” Supposed by Ajasson and Desfontaines to be Cat’s\r\neye Chalcedony. See Chapter 50, Note 3196.\r\n\r\n[3245] Belus, the father of Ninus, the “Bel” of Scripture. See Chapter\r\n58.\r\n\r\n[3246] A kind of Tecolithos, Dalechamps says. See B. xxxvi. c. 35, and\r\nChapter 68 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3247] “Grape-cluster stone.”\r\n\r\n[3248] “Puniceus” seems to be a preferable reading to “pampineus,”\r\n“like a vine-tendril,” given by the Bamberg MS.\r\n\r\n[3249] Possibly it may have been Datholite or Borate of lime, a variety\r\nof which is known as Botryolite.\r\n\r\n[3250] “Hair-stone.” This was probably either Iron alum, known also as\r\nAlun de plume; Alunogen, known also as Feather Alum or hair salt; or\r\nAmianthus, also called satin Asbestus. See B. xxxvi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[3251] “Ox-heart.” Supposed to be a sort of Turquois, Hardouin says.\r\n\r\n[3252] “Thunder-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3253] “Clod-stone.” It may possibly have been a kind of Geodes. See\r\nB. xxxvi. c. 32. Dalechamps, however, identifies it with Crapaudine,\r\nToad-stone, or Bufonite, supposed in former times to be produced by the\r\ntoad, but in reality the fossil tooth of a fish.\r\n\r\n[3254] See B. iii. c. 4.\r\n\r\n[3255] See B. xxxiv. c. 22, and Chapter 65 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3256] Identical, probably, with the Callaina of Chapter 33, our\r\nTurquois.\r\n\r\n[3257] Lapis lazuli.\r\n\r\n[3258] “Smoke-stone.” Identical with the jasper called “capnias,” in\r\nChapter 37.\r\n\r\n[3259] In Chapter 37 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3260] “Cappadocian stone.”\r\n\r\n[3261] Like the “callaina” or “callais.”\r\n\r\n[3262] See Chapter 33 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3263] “Attractive stone.” A large rocky stone, according to Solinus.\r\nDalechamps thinks that it must have been a kind of amber or bitumen, an\r\nopinion with which Desfontaines coincides.\r\n\r\n[3264] “Looking-glass stone,” or “mirror stone.” A variety of Specular\r\nstone, probably.\r\n\r\n[3265] “Onion stone.” A kind of agate, according to Dalechamps. It had\r\nits name probably from the union of its streaks like those on the neck\r\nof an onion.\r\n\r\n[3266] “Pottery stone.”\r\n\r\n[3267] See B. xxix. c. 38, Vol. V. p. 415.\r\n\r\n[3268] The Cinædus. See B. xxxii. c. 53.\r\n\r\n[3269] By its clear or clouded colour, it was said.\r\n\r\n[3270] “Wax stone.”\r\n\r\n[3271] From κίρκος, a “hawk” or “falcon.”\r\n\r\n[3272] “Hair-like;” from κόρση, the “hair.”\r\n\r\n[3273] “Coral agate.” See Chapter 54 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3274] Vermilion. See B. xxxiii. cc. 37, 40.\r\n\r\n[3275] “Strong stone”—from κρατερὸς, “strong.” Supposed by\r\nsome to have been amber-coloured Hyacinth.\r\n\r\n[3276] Oriental topaz, probably. See Chapters 42 and 43 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3277] “Saffron-coloured,” probably. If this is the meaning of the\r\nname, it may be supposed to have resembled the bigaroon cherry.\r\n\r\n[3278] “Pregnant stone. An aëtites or geodes, probably. See B. xxx. c.\r\n44, and B. xxxvi. c. 39.\r\n\r\n[3279] “Sounding like brass.” Probably Clinkstone or Phonolite, a\r\ncompact feldspathic rock of a greyish colour, clinking under the hammer\r\nwhen struck, somewhat like a metal.\r\n\r\n[3280] “Swallow-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3281] “Tortoise-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3282] Six in the morning until mid-day.\r\n\r\n[3283] “Tortoise-like stone.”\r\n\r\n[3284] “Chelone,” in Greek.\r\n\r\n[3285] “Grass-green stone.” It is just possible that the Chlorite of\r\nmodern Mineralogy, a kind of emerald-green talc, or hydrous silicate of\r\nmagnesia, may be meant: but we must dismiss the story of the wagtail.\r\n\r\n[3286] The pied wagtail, Motacilla alba of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[3287] See B. vi. c. 31.\r\n\r\n[3288] “Golden light.” Ajasson suggests that this may have been a\r\nyellow phosphate of lead, which emitted light at night, from its close\r\nvicinity to naphtha. Bologna stone, Bolognian spar, or sulphate of\r\nBarytes, has also been suggested. Topaz, too, is mentioned.\r\n\r\n[3289] “Golden face.”\r\n\r\n[3290] A variety of Hyacinth, according to Dalechamps.\r\n\r\n[3291] From κηπὸς, “a garden,” it is thought; on account of\r\nits varied colours.\r\n\r\n[3292] “Laurel-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3293] “Substitute” for beryl.\r\n\r\n[3294] “Two-formed,” or “of a double nature.” A grand acquisition,\r\nas Ajasson remarks, for the worshippers of Priapus. See a similar\r\ncharacteristic in the Eryngium, our Eringo, B. xxii. c. 9] also\r\nMandragora, B. xxv. c. 94, Note 877.\r\n\r\n[3295] “Stone of Dionysus” or “Bacchus.”\r\n\r\n[3296] “Dragon stone.”\r\n\r\n[3297] The serpent so called—“draco.” See B. xxix. c. 20.\r\n\r\n[3298] A story invented, no doubt, by the sellers of some kind of\r\nprecious stone.\r\n\r\n[3299] “Heart-shaped.” A turquois, Hardouin thinks. See “Bucardia” in\r\nChapter 55 above.\r\n\r\n[3300] “The best.”\r\n\r\n[3301] “Formed like the testes.”\r\n\r\n[3302] “Red stone,” apparently. The reading is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3303] The reading is doubtful, but the word may possibly mean “stone\r\nof love,” or something equivalent.\r\n\r\n[3304] “Fine-haired.”\r\n\r\n[3305] “Skilled in sacred matters.”\r\n\r\n[3306] “Of fair length.” Ajasson thinks that this may have been a\r\nvariety of Pyromachic silex, or gun flint, nearly allied to Chalcedony.\r\n\r\n[3307] A preferable reading, probably, to “Eumitres.” It perhaps took\r\nits name from Mithres, the god of the Sun among the Persians, and\r\nmeant “blessing of Mithres.” Ajasson thinks that it may have been\r\ngreen Tourmaline, and that its electric properties may have been very\r\n“serviceable to the charlatans who had the monopoly of the Temple of\r\nBel.”\r\n\r\n[3308] See Chapter 55 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3309] “With beautiful leaves.” By some authorities this is thought to\r\nbe Opal, by others Heliotrope or Bloodstone. Ajasson thinks that it may\r\nhave been a general name for Jasper quartz, or else that it was Quartz\r\nagate opalized.\r\n\r\n[3310] This reading is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3311] “Mouldy stone.”\r\n\r\n[3312] “Stone of the religious.”\r\n\r\n[3313] “Black on the surface.” This is the case, Ajasson remarks, with\r\nmany stones of the class known as “Cat’s eye.”\r\n\r\n[3314] “Galaxy stone.” Ajasson thinks that this may possibly have been\r\nan Opal, or a dead white Topaz, traversed by lines of other colours.\r\n\r\n[3315] “Milk stone.”\r\n\r\n[3316] Probably milk-white Quartz, Ajasson thinks.\r\n\r\n[3317] “White earth.”\r\n\r\n[3318] “White-streaked stone.”\r\n\r\n[3319] “Clouded.”\r\n\r\n[3320] See Chapter 54 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3321] An Eastern name, probably.\r\n\r\n[3322] A Geodes or Aëtites, probably. See B. xxxvi. c. 39, and Chapter\r\n56 of this Book, Note 3278.\r\n\r\n[3323] “Tongue of stone.”\r\n\r\n[3324] Divination from the appearance of the moon.\r\n\r\n[3325] “Gorgon stone.” The head of the Gorgon Medusa was fabled to turn\r\nthose into stone who looked upon it.\r\n\r\n[3326] See B. xxxii. c. 11.\r\n\r\n[3327] This reading is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3328] Now known as Heliotrope, bloodstone, or blood jasper. It is of a\r\ndeep-green colour, with red spots.\r\n\r\n[3329] “Turning under the sun.”\r\n\r\n[3330] See B. xxii. c. 29.\r\n\r\n[3331] “Stone of Hephæstos” or “Vulcan.”\r\n\r\n[3332] It acting as a burning-glass, probably.\r\n\r\n[3333] See B. iv. c. 20, and B. v. c. 22.\r\n\r\n[3334] “Genitals of Mercury.” This singular stone does not appear to\r\nhave been identified. See Note 3294 above.\r\n\r\n[3335] “Sixty colour stone.”\r\n\r\n[3336] See B. v. cc. 5, 8, and B. vi. c. 34.\r\n\r\n[3337] “Hawk stone.” It is perhaps identical with the “Circos,”\r\nmentioned in Chapter 56. Aëtius says that Hieracitis was of a greenish\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n[3338] “Sand-stone.” Ajasson thinks that this was a granular quartz, of\r\na friable nature when subjected to compression.\r\n\r\n[3339] As to the identity of “nitrum,” see B, xxxi. c, 46.\r\n\r\n[3340] “Horn of [Jupiter] Hammon.” He here alludes to the Ammonites of\r\nmodern Geology, an extinct race of molluscous animals that inhabited\r\nconvoluted shells, and which are commonly known as “snake-stones.” They\r\nabound in strata of the secondary formation, and vary from the size of\r\na bean to that of a coach-wheel.\r\n\r\n[3341] The reading of this word is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3342] “Hyæna stone.”\r\n\r\n[3343] As to this stone, see B. xxxvi. c. 25.\r\n\r\n[3344] “Yellow” stone. See Chapter 45.\r\n\r\n[3345] “Idæan fingers.” These were probably Belemnites, so called from\r\ntheir long, tapering shape, and being first observed, perhaps, on Mount\r\nIda in Crete. Belemnites are the shells of fossil Cephalopods, and are\r\ncommonly known as “thunder stones.”\r\n\r\n[3346] “Jaundice stone.”\r\n\r\n[3347] “Gem of Jove.”\r\n\r\n[3348] “Dew stone.”\r\n\r\n[3349] “Indian stone.”\r\n\r\n[3350] It is just possible that he may be thinking of Indigo here,\r\nwhich he has before called by the same name. See B. xxxiii. c. 57.\r\n\r\n[3351] “Violet-coloured.”\r\n\r\n[3352] “Scale stone.” A fossil, probably.\r\n\r\n[3353] “White eye.” Cat’s eye chalcedony, perhaps. See “Astrobolos” in\r\nChapter 48, and “Beli oculus” in Chapter 55, of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3354] “Variegated with white.”\r\n\r\n[3355] “Yellow incense.”\r\n\r\n[3356] “Meadow-green stone.”\r\n\r\n[3357] “Fat stone.”\r\n\r\n[3358] “White gold.” Ajasson thinks that this may have been either a\r\nsub-variety of Hyalin amethystine quartz, a yellow quartz or false\r\ntopaz, or else an unctuous, white quartz, either opaque or transparent.\r\n\r\n[3359] “Stone of Memnon.”\r\n\r\n[3360] This reading seems preferable to “Media,” given by the Bamberg\r\nand some other MSS.\r\n\r\n[3361] The enchantress of Colchis. The stone, no doubt was as fabulous\r\nas the enchantress.\r\n\r\n[3362] “Poppy stone.”\r\n\r\n[3363] For the origin of this name, see “Eumithres,” in Chapter 58,\r\nNote 3307.\r\n\r\n[3364] It was probably a kind of Opal.\r\n\r\n[3365] The reading here is very doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3366] This reading also is doubtful: it is probably an Eastern word.\r\nAccording to some authorities, this stone was a dark-brown rock\r\ncrystal. Ajasson identities it with Schorl or black Tourmaline, with a\r\nbase of Magnesia.\r\n\r\n[3367] Red Tourmaline, possibly, or Rubellite.\r\n\r\n[3368] Carnelian. See Chapter 31 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3369] “Ectypæ sculpturæ.” See B. xxxv. c. 43.\r\n\r\n[3370] “Myrrh stone.” It was an Eastern compound, probably. See Chapter\r\n54, Note 3211.\r\n\r\n[3371] “Wart stone.”\r\n\r\n[3372] “Myrtle stone.”\r\n\r\n[3373] “White in the middle.” This and the next seem to have been\r\ngeneral names for stones of a particular appearance.\r\n\r\n[3374] “Black in the middle.”\r\n\r\n[3375] Bacchus.\r\n\r\n[3376] A Greek word, signifying the skin of a fawn or deer, as worn\r\nby the Bacchanals in the celebration of their orgies. Ajasson is of\r\nopinion that this was a mottled quartz or agate, similar to those\r\nmentioned as resembling the spots of the lion, in Chapter 54, the\r\nLeontios and Pardalios of Chapter 73.\r\n\r\n[3377] This reading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3378] “Shower stone,” apparently.\r\n\r\n[3379] From “Notus,” the south wind, which usually brought rain.\r\n\r\n[3380] See Chapters 48 and 51.\r\n\r\n[3381] See Chapter 55 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3382] “Ass’s heart.”\r\n\r\n[3383] “Mountain stone.”\r\n\r\n[3384] See Chapter 67.\r\n\r\n[3385] “Shell-stone.” Not the same, probably, as the Cadmitis or\r\nOstracitis mentioned in Chapter 56 of this Book. See B. xxxvi. c. 31,\r\nwhere a stone of this name is also mentioned. Horn-stone, probably, a\r\nChalcedony, more brittle than flint, is meant in the present passage.\r\n\r\n[3386] See Chapter 56 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3387] See the beginning of Chapter 54.\r\n\r\n[3388] “Oyster-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3389] See B. xxxvi. chap. 67; our “Obsidian.”\r\n\r\n[3390] “Of all colours.” Either Opal, Ajasson thinks, or Iridized\r\nhyalin quartz.\r\n\r\n[3391] “All corners.” Ajasson seems to think that this may have been\r\nHyalin quartz.\r\n\r\n[3392] “Worthy of all love.”\r\n\r\n[3393] Of the same meaning as “paneros.”\r\n\r\n[3394] “Gem of Pontus.” According to Desfontaines, these stones are\r\nidentified, by some with agates, by others with sapphires.\r\n\r\n[3395] “Flame-coloured.”\r\n\r\n[3396] “Golden-coloured stone.”\r\n\r\n[3397] See B. xxxiii. c. 56, and B. xxxv. cc. 12, 16.\r\n\r\n[3398] “Palm-date stone. Desfontaines says that this is Jew stone, the\r\nfossil spine of an egg-shaped echinus. See Chapter 55, Note 3241.\r\n\r\n[3399] Φῦκος; whence the Latin “fucus.”\r\n\r\n[3400] “White around.”\r\n\r\n[3401] An Aëtites or Geodes, probably. See Chapter 56, Note 3278; also B.\r\nxxx. c. 44, and B. xxxvi. cc. 32, 39.\r\n\r\n[3402] “Earth stone,” apparently.\r\n\r\n[3403] The tomb of Tiresias was ordinarily pointed out in the vicinity\r\nof the Tilphusan Well, near Thebes; at least Pausanias states to that\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n[3404] “Gem of the Sun.” According to some, this is the Girasol opal;\r\nbut Ajasson has no doubt, from the description given of it by Photius,\r\nfrom Damascius, that it is identical with the “Asteria” of Chapter 47.\r\nSee also the “Astrion” of Chapter 48.\r\n\r\n[3405] Supposed to be jet.\r\n\r\n[3406] “Lizard stone.”\r\n\r\n[3407] “Flesh stone.”\r\n\r\n[3408] “Moon stone.” Our Selenite probably, crystallized sulphate of\r\nlime] the thin laminæ of which reflect the disk of the sun or moon.\r\n\r\n[3409] “Stone like iron.” See “Oritis” in Chapter 65; also B. xxxvi. c.\r\n25, and Chapter 15 of this Book, for minerals of this name.\r\n\r\n[3410] “Variegated iron.”\r\n\r\n[3411] So called from its teeth meeting evenly, like the jaw-teeth, and\r\nnot shaped like those of a saw, so formed that the teeth of one jaw\r\nlock with those of the other. See B. xi. c. 5. The Linnæan genus Sparus\r\nis of this kind.\r\n\r\n[3412] See B. v. cc. 4, 5, and B. vi. c. 37.\r\n\r\n[3413] “Fistulous stone.”\r\n\r\n[3414] “Three-coloured stone.”\r\n\r\n[3415] Meaning “Female root,” apparently. The reading, however, is\r\nuncertain.\r\n\r\n[3416] “Female heart,” apparently. The reading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3417] “Thracian stone.” The reading, however, is doubtful.\r\n\r\n[3418] “Ash-coloured stone.” It has been identified with Uranian agate\r\nby some.\r\n\r\n[3419] “Dissolving stone.” Probably our Jew stone, and identical with\r\nthe Phœnicitis of Chapter 66. See Note 3398.\r\n\r\n[3420] “Venus’ hair.” As Ajasson remarks, the description renders it\r\nnext to impossible to say what the stone was.\r\n\r\n[3421] “Liver stone.” Heavy spar, a sulphate of barytes, is sometimes\r\ncalled Hepatite.\r\n\r\n[3422] “Fat stone.” Saponite or soapstone, a silicate of magnesia, is\r\nalso known as Steatite.\r\n\r\n[3423] An ancient king of Syria, worshipped by the people of that\r\ncountry and the inhabitants of Phrygia. According to Macrobius, the\r\nAssyrians worshipped Jupiter and the Sun under this name.\r\n\r\n[3424] “Three-eye stone.” Some kind of Cat’s eye chalcedony, probably.\r\n\r\n[3425] “Crab stone.”\r\n\r\n[3426] “Viper-stone.”\r\n\r\n[3427] “Scorpion stone.”\r\n\r\n[3428] See B. ix. c. 29, B. xl. c. 61, and B. xxxii. c. 53. This was\r\nperhaps the same stone as the “Synodontitis” of Chapter 67.\r\n\r\n[3429] Which was called τριγλὰ, in Greek.\r\n\r\n[3430] “Ant stone.” Possibly a kind of amber.\r\n\r\n[3431] “Beetle stone.”\r\n\r\n[3432] “Wolf’s eye.”\r\n\r\n[3433] “Peacock stone.”\r\n\r\n[3434] “Golden sand.” This may possibly have been Aventurine quartz.\r\n\r\n[3435] “Millet stone.”\r\n\r\n[3436] “Oak stone.” Fossil coal, perhaps.\r\n\r\n[3437] “Ivy stone.”\r\n\r\n[3438] “Daffodil stone.” An Eastern compound, probably.\r\n\r\n[3439] “Bean stone.”\r\n\r\n[3440] Our “Jew stone,” probably; identical with the Phœnicitis of\r\nChapter 66 and the Tecolithos of Chapter 68.\r\n\r\n[3441] See Note 3398 to Chapter 66.\r\n\r\n[3442] See Chapter 66.\r\n\r\n[3443] See B. xxxvi. c. 43. Pebbles of white flint were probably meant\r\nunder this name; from which is derived, according to Ajasson, the\r\nFrench word _caillou_, meaning a flint pebble.\r\n\r\n[3444] “Fire stone.” Not a Pyrites of modern Mineralogy, probably.\r\n\r\n[3445] “With many zones.” Probably an agate or jasper.\r\n\r\n[3446] “Lightning stone.”\r\n\r\n[3447] “Flame stone.”\r\n\r\n[3448] “Burning coal stone.” See B. xxxvi. c. 38, and Chapter 27 of\r\nthis Book.\r\n\r\n[3449] “Containing liquid.” Identified by Desfontaines with the Geodes\r\nenhydros of modern Geology, which sometimes contains a liquid substance.\r\n\r\n[3450] “Many-haired stone.”\r\n\r\n[3451] As to these stones, agates or jaspers probably, see “Nebritis,”\r\nin Chapter 64, and the Note.\r\n\r\n[3452] “Dew stone.” The reading here is very doubtful. See Chapter 61.\r\n\r\n[3453] “Honey-coloured and yellow.”\r\n\r\n[3454] “Saffron stone.”\r\n\r\n[3455] All three being derived from the corresponding name in Greek.\r\n\r\n[3456] See Chapter 55 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3457] “Hand stone.”\r\n\r\n[3458] “Stone of necessity.”\r\n\r\n[3459] “Retaining stone.”\r\n\r\n[3460] “Tree stone.”\r\n\r\n[3461] De Lapidibus.\r\n\r\n[3462] He alludes to petrified shells, most probably.\r\n\r\n[3463] “Phaleræ.” See B. vii. c. 2, and B. xxxiii. c. 6.\r\n\r\n[3464] “Nature;” _i.e._ “works of Nature.”\r\n\r\n[3465] “Lenticula.” Like a lentil in shape.\r\n\r\n[3466] Substituting garnets for rubies, as an illustration.\r\n\r\n[3467] “Minium.” See Chapter 23 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3468] Lest the deception should be commonly practised. Seneca, Epist.\r\n19, mentions one Democritus, who had discovered the art of making\r\nartificial Emeralds. See further on this subject, Beckmann, Hist.

See B. xxxvi. c. 67, and Chapter 65 of this Book.\r\n\r\n[3473] See Chapter 15 of this Book.
