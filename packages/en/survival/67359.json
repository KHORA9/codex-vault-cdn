D. TURNBOW\r\n\r\n\r\nButter boxes used in shipping and storing butter in California, are\r\nusually made of spruce which is largely shipped in from other states\r\nparticularly from Washington and Oregon.\r\n\r\nWith the recent war, however, there came an acute shortage of spruce\r\non the Pacific Coast with a corresponding increase in price. The\r\ncommercial manufacturers did some work in an attempt to find a\r\nsubstitute for spruce, but the trade did not readily accept a change.\r\nThere was a demand from both the lumber and the butter interests for\r\ninvestigation to find a suitable substitute for spruce.\r\n\r\nThe production of spruce is somewhat limited in California, but there\r\nis an abundance of white fir and a limited amount of cottonwood\r\navailable. However, the creamerymen have not used white fir and\r\ncottonwood to any extent for butter containers, on account of the\r\nbelief that these materials would impart a wood flavor to the butter.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as nearly all of the butter made in this State is shipped or\r\nstored in wooden containers, the use of white fir or cottonwood, would\r\nmean first, a material saving to the butter manufacturers in marketing\r\nexpense, and second, an opportunity for the lumber interests to use a\r\nlarge amount of raw material already available in California, which\r\nheretofore had been of little commercial value or use.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER ABSORBS ODOR\r\n\r\nThe volatile fats in butter have the property of absorbing odors,\r\nwhich often results in an undesirable flavor. Great care then must be\r\nexercised in keeping butter from coming in contact with materials that\r\nwill impart a foreign flavor. Butter need be exposed to foreign odors\r\nonly a short length of time before the flavor is permanently affected.\r\n\r\nExperiments[A] were conducted, therefore, to determine whether white\r\nfir or cottonwood would impart a flavor to the butter and also to\r\ndetermine the possibility of storing butter in cubes and marketing it\r\nin 60-pound cases when these woods were used.\r\n\r\n[A] This experiment was suggested by Mr. M. B. Pratt, Deputy State\r\nForester. Through his coöperation, all box material was furnished by\r\nthe Swayne Lumber Company of Oroville and the Capitol Box Factory of\r\nSacramento.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBE BUTTER IN COLD STORAGE\r\n\r\nThe butter for cold storage was packed in white fir, cottonwood, and\r\nspruce containers holding ten pounds each. Both seasoned and unseasoned\r\nwoods were used in each of the three methods of packing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.—Butter packed in cubes paraffined and parchment\r\nlined.]\r\n\r\nThe first set packed with butter were plain unseasoned boxes of each\r\nof the woods. The second set had the inner surface paraffined before\r\npacking. The method of paraffining was to invert the box over a steam\r\njet and steam thoroughly. This served a double purpose in that it\r\nopened the pores of the wood and allowed the paraffin to penetrate, and\r\nthe heated surface of the wood kept the paraffin in a liquid condition\r\nso that it could be put on in a thinner coat than if the paraffin had\r\nbeen applied to a cold surface. After the boxes had been allowed to\r\ndrain, the inside was then painted with paraffin at 240° F. This method\r\ngave a complete covering to the wood, a result which is not always\r\nobtained by some of the commercial paraffin atomizers. The third set\r\nwas paraffined as above and, in addition, lined with good parchment\r\npaper so that no butter could come in contact with either wood or\r\nparaffin (fig. 1). Twenty-three 10-pound boxes were packed in the three\r\nways.\r\n\r\nThey were filled with the butter from one churning which scored 92½\r\nafter being chilled for 24 hours at 50° F. and were shipped immediately\r\nafter the first scoring to a cold storage plant in San Francisco and\r\nstored at a temperature of 12° F. The butter was scored monthly for six\r\nmonths. The summary of the scoring is given in table 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1\r\n\r\nInfluence of Various Woods on Cube Butter in Storage[B]\r\n\r\n[B] This scoring was done by T. J. Harris, San Francisco Dairy Produce\r\nExchange, S. L. Denning, Oakland, and G. D.

The butter was\r\nstored in a cold room, the temperature of which ranged from 48° to 50°\r\nF. It was held in storage twenty-eight days, which is within two days\r\nof the maximum time butter may be held and still sold as fresh butter.\r\nButter held over thirty days must be labeled “storage butter.” The\r\nbutter was scored four times during the storage period. The butter used\r\nwas all from the same churning which scored 93 after being chilled for\r\ntwenty-four hours at 50° F.\r\n\r\nTable 2 gives a summary of the scores showing the effect upon butter in\r\ncontainers with varying treatments. When paraffined, the inside of the\r\nboxes was painted with the paraffin at 240° F.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 2\r\n\r\nInfluence of Various Woods on Butter Packed in 60-Lb.

There was very little splitting in seasoned\r\ncottonwood. The nails, however, caused a slight splitting in the\r\nseasoned spruce and quite a noticeable splitting in the white fir, but\r\nnot enough in either to cause an appreciable loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Typical 60-pound white fir boxes showing general\r\nrun of this wood.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCube Butter in Cold Storage\r\n\r\n_Boxes paraffined and parchment lined._—White fir and cottonwood can\r\nbe used in place of spruce for storing butter in cubes, when properly\r\nseasoned, paraffined, and parchment lined.\r\n\r\nCottonwood is equal to spruce as a butter container. Butter stored in\r\ncottonwood boxes for six months had an average score of 0.048 of a\r\npoint above spruce treated in the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—Method of lining 60-pound boxes with paper.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—Parchment wrapped butter in parchment lined\r\nbox.]\r\n\r\nWhite fir may be used very successfully. It scored during the six\r\nmonths’ storage only an average of 0.381 of a point below spruce.\r\n\r\nIn the final scoring, after six months’ storage, none of the cubes\r\npacked in seasoned, paraffined and parchment lined containers received\r\na cut directly due to wood flavor.\r\n\r\nGreen or unseasoned white fir, cottonwood or spruce, may impart a\r\nslight wood flavor to the butter when packed in cubes, even though they\r\nare paraffined and parchment lined. The butter stored in unseasoned\r\ncubes scored an average of 0.218 of a point below the butter stored in\r\nseasoned boxes with the same treatment. While the average difference\r\nwas very small, in some cases there was a decided wood flavor which was\r\npronounced enough to affect materially the flavor of the butter.\r\n\r\n_Boxes paraffined but not parchment lined._—Unseasoned boxes of white\r\nfir, cottonwood and spruce, paraffined but not parchment lined are not\r\nentirely satisfactory for storing butter. The butter so stored was\r\ncriticized in practically all cases for wood flavor. Butter stored\r\nin white fir boxes scored 0.358 of a point lower than that in spruce\r\nboxes, while butter in cottonwood boxes scored 1.071 lower than that\r\nin spruce. Storing butter in cubes without parchment lining or in\r\ncubes carelessly lined with parchment will cause objectionable flavors\r\nregardless of the wood.\r\n\r\n_Boxes neither paraffined nor parchment lined._—Butter allowed to come\r\nin direct contact with any of the three untreated woods will always\r\ntake up wood flavor. The injury to the flavor is about equal from all\r\nthree woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSixty-Pound Boxes Packed for Market\r\n\r\nWhite fir is as good as spruce for 60-pound boxes when seasoned and\r\nparchment lined, the butter being wrapped in parchment only. Cottonwood\r\nis not quite as satisfactory as either spruce or white fir, there being\r\nsome criticism on the flavor of the butter.\r\n\r\nButter can be shipped in seasoned white fir or cottonwood boxes, lined\r\nwith ordinary wrapping paper, if the butter is parchment wrapped and\r\ncartoned. There is no advantage in using parchment paper to line the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nSince there was practically no trouble experienced in the unparaffined\r\nboxes, there is no advantage in paraffining the inside of the box.\r\n\r\nSince the completion of the investigational work, approximately 40,000\r\nwhite fir boxes have been used with entire satisfaction for shipping\r\nbutter at the University Farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATION PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE FOR FREE DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBULLETINS\r\n\r\n  No.\r\n\r\n  253.
