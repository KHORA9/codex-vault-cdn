MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES\r\n\r\nWith the present book we enter the field of the distinctively modern.\r\nThere is no precise date at which we take up each of the successive\r\nstories, but the main sweep of development has to do in each case with\r\nthe nineteenth century. We shall see at once that this is a time both\r\nof rapid progress and of great differentiation. We have heard almost\r\nnothing hitherto of such sciences as paleontology, geology, and\r\nmeteorology, each of which now demands full attention. Meantime,\r\nastronomy and what the workers of the elder day called natural\r\nphilosophy become wonderfully diversified and present numerous\r\nphases that would have been startling enough to the star-gazers and\r\nphilosophers of the earlier epoch.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, in the field of astronomy, Herschel is able, thanks\r\nto his perfected telescope, to discover a new planet and then to reach\r\nout into the depths of space and gain such knowledge of stars and\r\nnebulae as hitherto no one had more than dreamed of. Then, in rapid\r\nsequence, a whole coterie of hitherto unsuspected minor planets is\r\ndiscovered, stellar distances are measured, some members of the starry\r\ngalaxy are timed in their flight, the direction of movement of the solar\r\nsystem itself is investigated, the spectroscope reveals the chemical\r\ncomposition even of suns that are unthinkably distant, and a tangible\r\ntheory is grasped of the universal cycle which includes the birth and\r\ndeath of worlds.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the new studies of the earth's surface reveal secrets of\r\nplanetary formation hitherto quite inscrutable. It becomes known that\r\nthe strata of the earth's surface have been forming throughout untold\r\nages, and that successive populations differing utterly from one another\r\nhave peopled the earth in different geological epochs. The entire point\r\nof view of thoughtful men becomes changed in contemplating the history\r\nof the world in which we live--albeit the newest thought harks back to\r\nsome extent to those days when the inspired thinkers of early Greece\r\ndreamed out the wonderful theories with which our earlier chapters have\r\nmade our readers familiar.\r\n\r\nIn the region of natural philosophy progress is no less pronounced and\r\nno less striking. It suffices here, however, by way of anticipation,\r\nsimply to name the greatest generalization of the century in physical\r\nscience--the doctrine of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SUCCESSORS OF NEWTON IN ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nHEVELIUS AND HALLEY\r\n\r\nSTRANGELY enough, the decade immediately following Newton was one of\r\ncomparative barrenness in scientific progress, the early years of the\r\neighteenth century not being as productive of great astronomers as the\r\nlater years of the seventeenth, or, for that matter, as the later years\r\nof the eighteenth century itself. Several of the prominent astronomers\r\nof the later seventeenth century lived on into the opening years of the\r\nfollowing century, however, and the younger generation soon developed\r\na coterie of astronomers, among whom Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and\r\nHerschel, as we shall see, were to accomplish great things in this field\r\nbefore the century closed.\r\n\r\nOne of the great seventeenth-century astronomers, who died just before\r\nthe close of the century, was Johannes Hevelius (1611-1687), of Dantzig,\r\nwho advanced astronomy by his accurate description of the face and\r\nthe spots of the moon. But he is remembered also for having retarded\r\nprogress by his influence in refusing to use telescopic sights in his\r\nobservations, preferring until his death the plain sights long before\r\ndiscarded by most other astronomers. The advantages of these telescope\r\nsights have been discussed under the article treating of Robert Hooke,\r\nbut no such advantages were ever recognized by Hevelius. So great was\r\nHevelius's reputation as an astronomer that his refusal to recognize the\r\nadvantage of the telescope sights caused many astronomers to hesitate\r\nbefore accepting them as superior to the plain; and even the famous\r\nHalley, of whom we shall speak further in a moment, was sufficiently\r\nin doubt over the matter to pay the aged astronomer a visit to test his\r\nskill in using the old-style sights. Side by side, Hevelius and Halley\r\nmade their observations, Hevelius with his old instrument and Halley\r\nwith the new. The results showed slightly in the younger man's favor,\r\nbut not enough to make it an entirely convincing demonstration. The\r\nexplanation of this, however, did not lie in the lack of superiority\r\nof the telescopic instrument, but rather in the marvellous skill of the\r\naged Hevelius, whose dexterity almost compensated for the defect of his\r\ninstrument. What he might have accomplished could he have been induced\r\nto adopt the telescope can only be surmised.\r\n\r\nHalley himself was by no means a tyro in matters astronomical at that\r\ntime. As the only son of a wealthy soap-boiler living near London, he\r\nhad been given a liberal education, and even before leaving college\r\nmade such novel scientific observations as that of the change in the\r\nvariation of the compass. At nineteen years of age he discovered a new\r\nmethod of determining the elements of the planetary orbits which was a\r\ndistinct improvement over the old. The year following he sailed for the\r\nIsland of St, Helena to make observations of the heavens in the southern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nIt was while in St. Helena that Halley made his famous observation\r\nof the transit of Mercury over the sun's disk, this observation being\r\nconnected, indirectly at least, with his discovery of a method of\r\ndetermining the parallax of the planets. By parallax is meant the\r\napparent change in the position of an object, due really to a change in\r\nthe position of the observer. Thus, if we imagine two astronomers making\r\nobservations of the sun from opposite sides of the earth at the same\r\ntime, it is obvious that to these observers the sun will appear to be\r\nat two different points in the sky. Half the angle measuring this\r\ndifference would be known as the sun's parallax. This would depend,\r\nthen, upon the distance of the earth from the sun and the length of\r\nthe earth's radius. Since the actual length of this radius has been\r\ndetermined, the parallax of any heavenly body enables the astronomer to\r\ndetermine its exact distance.\r\n\r\nThe parallaxes can be determined equally well, however, if two observers\r\nare separated by exactly known distances, several hundreds or thousands\r\nof miles apart. In the case of a transit of Venus across the sun's\r\ndisk, for example, an observer at New York notes the image of the planet\r\nmoving across the sun's disk, and notes also the exact time of this\r\nobservation. In the same manner an observer at London makes similar\r\nobservations. Knowing the distance between New York and London, and\r\nthe different time of the passage, it is thus possible to calculate the\r\ndifference of the parallaxes of the sun and a planet crossing its disk.\r\nThe idea of thus determining the parallax of the planets originated, or\r\nat least was developed, by Halley, and from this phenomenon he thought\r\nit possible to conclude the dimensions of all the planetary orbits. As\r\nwe shall see further on, his views were found to be correct by later\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\nIn 1721 Halley succeeded Flamsteed as astronomer royal at the Greenwich\r\nObservatory. Although sixty-four years of age at that time his activity\r\nin astronomy continued unabated for another score of years. At Greenwich\r\nhe undertook some tedious observations of the moon, and during those\r\nobservations was first to detect the acceleration of mean motion. He\r\nwas unable to explain this, however, and it remained for Laplace in the\r\nclosing years of the century to do so, as we shall see later.\r\n\r\nHalley's book, the Synopsis Astronomiae Cometicae, is one of the most\r\nvaluable additions to astronomical literature since the time of Kepler.\r\nHe was first to attempt the calculation of the orbit of a comet, having\r\nrevived the ancient opinion that comets belong to the solar system,\r\nmoving in eccentric orbits round the sun, and his calculation of the\r\norbit of the comet of 1682 led him to predict correctly the return of\r\nthat comet in 1758. Halley's Study of Meteors.\r\n\r\nLike other astronomers of his time he was greatly puzzled over the\r\nwell-known phenomena of shooting-stars, or meteors, making many\r\nobservations himself, and examining carefully the observations of other\r\nastronomers. In 1714 he gave his views as to the origin and composition\r\nof these mysterious visitors in the earth's atmosphere. As this\r\nsubject will be again referred to in a later chapter, Halley's views,\r\nrepresenting the most advanced views of his age, are of interest.\r\n\r\n\"The theory of the air seemeth at present,\" he says, \"to be perfectly\r\nwell understood, and the differing densities thereof at all altitudes;\r\nfor supposing the same air to occupy spaces reciprocally proportional to\r\nthe quantity of the superior or incumbent air, I have elsewhere proved\r\nthat at forty miles high the air is rarer than at the surface of\r\nthe earth at three thousand times; and that the utmost height of the\r\natmosphere, which reflects light in the Crepusculum, is not fully\r\nforty-five miles, notwithstanding which 'tis still manifest that some\r\nsort of vapors, and those in no small quantity, arise nearly to that\r\nheight. An instance of this may be given in the great light the society\r\nhad an account of (vide Transact. Sep., 1676) from Dr. Wallis, which was\r\nseen in very distant counties almost over all the south part of England.\r\nOf which though the doctor could not get so particular a relation as was\r\nrequisite to determine the height thereof, yet from the distant places\r\nit was seen in, it could not but be very many miles high.\r\n\r\n\"So likewise that meteor which was seen in 1708, on the 31st of July,\r\nbetween nine and ten o'clock at night, was evidently between forty and\r\nfifty miles perpendicularly high, and as near as I can gather, over\r\nShereness and the buoy on the Nore. For it was seen at London moving\r\nhorizontally from east by north to east by south at least fifty degrees\r\nhigh, and at Redgrove, in Suffolk, on the Yarmouth road, about twenty\r\nmiles from the east coast of England, and at least forty miles to the\r\neastward of London, it appeared a little to the westward of the south,\r\nsuppose south by west, and was seen about thirty degrees high, sliding\r\nobliquely downward. I was shown in both places the situation thereof,\r\nwhich was as described, but could wish some person skilled in\r\nastronomical matters bad seen it, that we might pronounce concerning its\r\nheight with more certainty. Yet, as it is, we may securely conclude\r\nthat it was not many more miles westerly than Redgrove, which, as I\r\nsaid before, is about forty miles more easterly than London. Suppose it,\r\ntherefore, where perpendicular, to have been thirty-five miles east\r\nfrom London, and by the altitude it appeared at in London--viz., fifty\r\ndegrees, its tangent will be forty-two miles, for the height of the\r\nmeteor above the surface of the earth; which also is rather of the\r\nleast, because the altitude of the place shown me is rather more than\r\nless than fifty degrees; and the like may be concluded from the altitude\r\nit appeared in at Redgrove, near seventy miles distant. Though at this\r\nvery great distance, it appeared to move with an incredible velocity,\r\ndarting, in a very few seconds of time, for about twelve degrees of\r\na great circle from north to south, being very bright at its first\r\nappearance; and it died away at the east of its course, leaving for some\r\ntime a pale whiteness in the place, with some remains of it in the track\r\nwhere it had gone; but no hissing sound as it passed, or bounce of an\r\nexplosion were heard.\r\n\r\n\"It may deserve the honorable society's thoughts, how so great a\r\nquantity of vapor should be raised to the top of the atmosphere, and\r\nthere collected, so as upon its ascension or otherwise illumination, to\r\ngive a light to a circle of above one hundred miles diameter, not much\r\ninferior to the light of the moon; so as one might see to take a pin\r\nfrom the ground in the otherwise dark night. 'Tis hard to conceive what\r\nsort of exhalations should rise from the earth, either by the action\r\nof the sun or subterranean heat, so as to surmount the extreme cold\r\nand rareness of the air in those upper regions: but the fact is\r\nindisputable, and therefore requires a solution.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this much of the paper it appears that there was a general belief\r\nthat this burning mass was heated vapor thrown off from the earth in\r\nsome mysterious manner, yet this is unsatisfactory to Halley, for after\r\nciting various other meteors that have appeared within his knowledge, he\r\ngoes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"What sort of substance it must be, that could be so impelled and\r\nignited at the same time; there being no Vulcano or other Spiraculum of\r\nsubterraneous fire in the northeast parts of the world, that we ever yet\r\nheard of, from whence it might be projected.\r\n\r\n\"I have much considered this appearance, and think it one of the hardest\r\nthings to account for that I have yet met with in the phenomena of\r\nmeteors, and I am induced to think that it must be some collection of\r\nmatter formed in the aether, as it were, by some fortuitous concourse\r\nof atoms, and that the earth met with it as it passed along in its orb,\r\nthen but newly formed, and before it had conceived any great impetus of\r\ndescent towards the sun. For the direction of it was exactly opposite to\r\nthat of the earth, which made an angle with the meridian at that time\r\nof sixty-seven gr., that is, its course was from west southwest to east\r\nnortheast, wherefore the meteor seemed to move the contrary way. And\r\nbesides falling into the power of the earth's gravity, and losing its\r\nmotion from the opposition of the medium, it seems that it descended\r\ntowards the earth, and was extinguished in the Tyrrhene Sea, to the\r\nwest southwest of Leghorn. The great blow being heard upon its first\r\nimmersion into the water, and the rattling like the driving of a cart\r\nover stones being what succeeded upon its quenching; something like this\r\nis always heard upon quenching a very hot iron in water. These facts\r\nbeing past dispute, I would be glad to have the opinion of the learned\r\nthereon, and what objection can be reasonably made against the above\r\nhypothesis, which I humbly submit to their censure.\"(1)\r\n\r\nThese few paragraphs, coming as they do from a leading\r\neighteenth-century astronomer, convey more clearly than any comment the\r\nactual state of the meteorological learning at that time. That this ball\r\nof fire, rushing \"at a greater velocity than the swiftest cannon-ball,\"\r\nwas simply a mass of heated rock passing through our atmosphere, did not\r\noccur to him, or at least was not credited. Nor is this surprising when\r\nwe reflect that at that time universal gravitation had been but recently\r\ndiscovered; heat had not as yet been recognized as simply a form of\r\nmotion; and thunder and lightning were unexplained mysteries, not to\r\nbe explained for another three-quarters of a century. In the chapter on\r\nmeteorology we shall see how the solution of this mystery that puzzled\r\nHalley and his associates all their lives was finally attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRADLEY AND THE ABERRATION OF LIGHT\r\n\r\nHalley was succeeded as astronomer royal by a man whose useful additions\r\nto the science were not to be recognized or appreciated fully until\r\nbrought to light by the Prussian astronomer Bessel early in the\r\nnineteenth century. This was Dr. James Bradley, an ecclesiastic, who\r\nranks as one of the most eminent astronomers of the eighteenth century.\r\nHis most remarkable discovery was the explanation of a peculiar motion\r\nof the pole-star, first observed, but not explained, by Picard a\r\ncentury before. For many years a satisfactory explanation was sought\r\nunsuccessfully by Bradley and his fellow-astronomers, but at last he was\r\nable to demonstrate that the stary Draconis, on which he was making his\r\nobservations, described, or appeared to describe, a small ellipse.\r\nIf this observation was correct, it afforded a means of computing the\r\naberration of any star at all times. The explanation of the physical\r\ncause of this aberration, as Bradley thought, and afterwards\r\ndemonstrated, was the result of the combination of the motion of light\r\nwith the annual motion of the earth. Bradley first formulated this\r\ntheory in 1728, but it was not until 1748--twenty years of continuous\r\nstruggle and observation by him--that he was prepared to communicate the\r\nresults of his efforts to the Royal Society. This remarkable paper is\r\nthought by the Frenchman, Delambre, to entitle its author to a place in\r\nscience beside such astronomers as Hipparcbus and Kepler.\r\n\r\nBradley's studies led him to discover also the libratory motion of the\r\nearth's axis. \"As this appearance of Draconis indicated a diminution\r\nof the inclination of the earth's axis to the plane of the ecliptic,\"\r\nhe says; \"and as several astronomers have supposed THAT inclination to\r\ndiminish regularly; if this phenomenon depended upon such a cause, and\r\namounted to 18\" in nine years, the obliquity of the ecliptic would, at\r\nthat rate, alter a whole minute in thirty years; which is much\r\nfaster than any observations, before made, would allow. I had reason,\r\ntherefore, to think that some part of this motion at the least, if not\r\nthe whole, was owing to the moon's action upon the equatorial parts of\r\nthe earth; which, I conceived, might cause a libratory motion of\r\nthe earth's axis. But as I was unable to judge, from only nine years\r\nobservations, whether the axis would entirely recover the same position\r\nthat it had in the year 1727, I found it necessary to continue my\r\nobservations through a whole period of the moon's nodes; at the end of\r\nwhich I had the satisfaction to see, that the stars, returned into the\r\nsame position again; as if there had been no alteration at all in the\r\ninclination of the earth's axis; which fully convinced me that I had\r\nguessed rightly as to the cause of the phenomena. This circumstance\r\nproves likewise, that if there be a gradual diminution of the obliquity\r\nof the ecliptic, it does not arise only from an alteration in the\r\nposition of the earth's axis, but rather from some change in the plane\r\nof the ecliptic itself; because the stars, at the end of the period\r\nof the moon's nodes, appeared in the same places, with respect to the\r\nequator, as they ought to have done, if the earth's axis had retained\r\nthe same inclination to an invariable plane.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH ASTRONOMERS\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, astronomers across the channel were by no means idle. In\r\nFrance several successful observers were making many additions to the\r\nalready long list of observations of the first astronomer of the Royal\r\nObservatory of Paris, Dominic Cassini (1625-1712), whose reputation\r\namong his contemporaries was much greater than among succeeding\r\ngenerations of astronomers. Perhaps the most deserving of these\r\nsuccessors was Nicolas Louis de Lacaille (1713-1762), a theologian who\r\nhad been educated at the expense of the Duke of Bourbon, and who, soon\r\nafter completing his clerical studies, came under the patronage of\r\nCassini, whose attention had been called to the young man's interest in\r\nthe sciences. One of Lacaille's first under-takings was the remeasuring\r\nof the French are of the meridian, which had been incorrectly measured\r\nby his patron in 1684. This was begun in 1739, and occupied him for\r\ntwo years before successfully completed. As a reward, however, he was\r\nadmitted to the academy and appointed mathematical professor in Mazarin\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nIn 1751 he went to the Cape of Good Hope for the purpose of determining\r\nthe sun's parallax by observations of the parallaxes of Mars and Venus,\r\nand incidentally to make observations on the other southern hemisphere\r\nstars. The results of this undertaking were most successful, and were\r\ngiven in his Coelum australe stelligerum, etc., published in 1763. In\r\nthis he shows that in the course of a single year he had observed some\r\nten thousand stars, and computed the places of one thousand nine hundred\r\nand forty-two of them, measured a degree of the meridian, and made\r\nmany observations of the moon--productive industry seldom equalled in\r\na single year in any field. These observations were of great service to\r\nthe astronomers, as they afforded the opportunity of comparing the stars\r\nof the southern hemisphere with those of the northern, which were being\r\nobserved simultaneously by Lelande at Berlin.\r\n\r\nLacaille's observations followed closely upon the determination of an\r\nabsorbing question which occupied the attention of the astronomers in\r\nthe early part of the century. This question was as to the shape of the\r\nearth--whether it was actually flattened at the poles. To settle this\r\nquestion once for all the Academy of Sciences decided to make the\r\nactual measurement of the length of two degrees, one as near the pole\r\nas possible, the other at the equator. Accordingly, three astronomers,\r\nGodin, Bouguer, and La Condamine, made the journey to a spot on the\r\nequator in Peru, while four astronomers, Camus, Clairaut, Maupertuis,\r\nand Lemonnier, made a voyage to a place selected in Lapland. The result\r\nof these expeditions was the determination that the globe is oblately\r\nspheroidal.\r\n\r\nA great contemporary and fellow-countryman of Lacaille was Jean Le Rond\r\nd'Alembert (1717-1783), who, although not primarily an astronomer, did\r\nso much with his mathematical calculations to aid that science that\r\nhis name is closely connected with its progress during the eighteenth\r\ncentury. D'Alembert, who became one of the best-known men of science of\r\nhis day, and whose services were eagerly sought by the rulers of Europe,\r\nbegan life as a foundling, having been exposed in one of the markets of\r\nParis. The sickly infant was adopted and cared for in the family of a\r\npoor glazier, and treated as a member of the family. In later years,\r\nhowever, after the foundling had become famous throughout Europe, his\r\nmother, Madame Tencin, sent for him, and acknowledged her relationship.\r\nIt is more than likely that the great philosopher believed her story,\r\nbut if so he did not allow her the satisfaction of knowing his belief,\r\ndeclaring always that Madame Tencin could \"not be nearer than a\r\nstep-mother to him, since his mother was the wife of the glazier.\"\r\n\r\nD'Alembert did much for the cause of science by his example as well\r\nas by his discoveries. By living a plain but honest life, declining\r\nmagnificent offers of positions from royal patrons, at the same time\r\nrefusing to grovel before nobility, he set a worthy example to other\r\nphilosophers whose cringing and pusillanimous attitude towards persons\r\nof wealth or position had hitherto earned them the contempt of the upper\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nHis direct additions to astronomy are several, among others the\r\ndetermination of the mutation of the axis of the earth. He also\r\ndetermined the ratio of the attractive forces of the sun and moon,\r\nwhich he found to be about as seven to three. From this he reached the\r\nconclusion that the earth must be seventy times greater than the moon.\r\nThe first two volumes of his Researches on the Systems of the World,\r\npublished in 1754, are largely devoted to mathematical and astronomical\r\nproblems, many of them of little importance now, but of great interest\r\nto astronomers at that time.\r\n\r\nAnother great contemporary of D'Alembert, whose name is closely\r\nassociated and frequently confounded with his, was Jean Baptiste Joseph\r\nDelambre (1749-1822). More fortunate in birth as also in his educational\r\nadvantages, Delambre as a youth began his studies under the celebrated\r\npoet Delille. Later he was obliged to struggle against poverty,\r\nsupporting himself for a time by making translations from Latin, Greek,\r\nItalian, and English, and acting as tutor in private families. The\r\nturning-point of his fortune came when the attention of Lalande was\r\ncalled to the young man by his remarkable memory, and Lalande soon\r\nshowed his admiration by giving Delambre certain difficult astronomical\r\nproblems to solve. By performing these tasks successfully his future as\r\nan astronomer became assured. At that time the planet Uranus had just\r\nbeen discovered by Herschel, and the Academy of Sciences offered as the\r\nsubject for one of its prizes the determination of the planet's orbit.\r\nDelambre made this determination and won the prize--a feat that brought\r\nhim at once into prominence.\r\n\r\nBy his writings he probably did as much towards perfecting modern\r\nastronomy as any one man. His History of Astronomy is not merely a\r\nnarrative of progress of astronomy but a complete abstract of all the\r\ncelebrated works written on the subject. Thus he became famous as an\r\nhistorian as well as an astronomer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEONARD EULER\r\n\r\nStill another contemporary of D'Alembert and Delambre, and somewhat\r\nolder than either of them, was Leonard Euler (1707-1783), of Basel,\r\nwhose fame as a philosopher equals that of either of the great\r\nFrenchmen. He is of particular interest here in his capacity of\r\nastronomer, but astronomy was only one of the many fields of science in\r\nwhich he shone. Surely something out of the ordinary was to be expected\r\nof the man who could \"repeat the AEneid of Virgil from the beginning\r\nto the end without hesitation, and indicate the first and last line of\r\nevery page of the edition which he used.\" Something was expected, and he\r\nfulfilled these expectations.\r\n\r\nIn early life he devoted himself to the study of theology and the\r\nOriental languages, at the request of his father, but his love of\r\nmathematics proved too strong, and, with his father's consent, he\r\nfinally gave up his classical studies and turned to his favorite study,\r\ngeometry. In 1727 he was invited by Catharine I. to reside in St.\r\nPetersburg, and on accepting this invitation he was made an associate\r\nof the Academy of Sciences. A little later he was made professor of\r\nphysics, and in 1733 professor of mathematics. In 1735 he solved a\r\nproblem in three days which some of the eminent mathematicians would not\r\nundertake under several months. In 1741 Frederick the Great invited him\r\nto Berlin, where he soon became a member of the Academy of Sciences and\r\nprofessor of mathematics; but in 1766 he returned to St. Petersburg.\r\nTowards the close of his life he became virtually blind, being obliged\r\nto dictate his thoughts, sometimes to persons entirely ignorant of the\r\nsubject in hand. Nevertheless, his remarkable memory, still further\r\nheightened by his blindness, enabled him to carry out the elaborate\r\ncomputations frequently involved.\r\n\r\nEuler's first memoir, transmitted to the Academy of Sciences of Paris\r\nin 1747, was on the planetary perturbations. This memoir carried off the\r\nprize that had been offered for the analytical theory of the motions of\r\nJupiter and Saturn. Other memoirs followed, one in 1749 and another in\r\n1750, with further expansions of the same subject. As some slight\r\nerrors were found in these, such as a mistake in some of the formulae\r\nexpressing the secular and periodic inequalities, the academy proposed\r\nthe same subject for the prize of 1752. Euler again competed, and won\r\nthis prize also. The contents of this memoir laid the foundation for\r\nthe subsequent demonstration of the permanent stability of the planetary\r\nsystem by Laplace and Lagrange.\r\n\r\nIt was Euler also who demonstrated that within certain fixed limits\r\nthe eccentricities and places of the aphelia of Saturn and Jupiter are\r\nsubject to constant variation, and he calculated that after a lapse\r\nof about thirty thousand years the elements of the orbits of these two\r\nplanets recover their original values.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE PROGRESS OF MODERN ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW epoch in astronomy begins with the work of William Herschel, the\r\nHanoverian, whom England made hers by adoption. He was a man with a\r\npositive genius for sidereal discovery. At first a mere amateur in\r\nastronomy, he snatched time from his duties as music-teacher to grind\r\nhim a telescopic mirror, and began gazing at the stars. Not content with\r\nhis first telescope, he made another and another, and he had such genius\r\nfor the work that he soon possessed a better instrument than was ever\r\nmade before. His patience in grinding the curved reflective surface was\r\nmonumental. Sometimes for sixteen hours together he must walk steadily\r\nabout the mirror, polishing it, without once removing his hands.\r\nMeantime his sister, always his chief lieutenant, cheered him with her\r\npresence, and from time to time put food into his mouth. The telescope\r\ncompleted, the astronomer turned night into day, and from sunset to\r\nsunrise, year in and year out, swept the heavens unceasingly, unless\r\nprevented by clouds or the brightness of the moon. His sister sat always\r\nat his side, recording his observations. They were in the open air,\r\nperched high at the mouth of the reflector, and sometimes it was so cold\r\nthat the ink froze in the bottle in Caroline Herschel's hand; but the\r\ntwo enthusiasts hardly noticed a thing so common-place as terrestrial\r\nweather. They were living in distant worlds.\r\n\r\nThe results? What could they be? Such enthusiasm would move mountains.\r\nBut, after all, the moving of mountains seems a liliputian task compared\r\nwith what Herschel really did with those wonderful telescopes. He moved\r\nworlds, stars, a universe--even, if you please, a galaxy of universes;\r\nat least he proved that they move, which seems scarcely less wonderful;\r\nand he expanded the cosmos, as man conceives it, to thousands of times\r\nthe dimensions it had before. As a mere beginning, he doubled the\r\ndiameter of the solar system by observing the great outlying planet\r\nwhich we now call Uranus, but which he christened Georgium Sidus,\r\nin honor of his sovereign, and which his French contemporaries, not\r\nrelishing that name, preferred to call Herschel.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was but a trifle compared with what Herschel did later\r\non, but it gave him world-wide reputation none the less. Comets and\r\nmoons aside, this was the first addition to the solar system that had\r\nbeen made within historic times, and it created a veritable furor of\r\npopular interest and enthusiasm. Incidentally King George was flattered\r\nat having a world named after him, and he smiled on the astronomer, and\r\ncame with his court to have a look at his namesake. The inspection\r\nwas highly satisfactory; and presently the royal favor enabled the\r\nastronomer to escape the thraldom of teaching music and to devote his\r\nentire time to the more congenial task of star-gazing.\r\n\r\nThus relieved from the burden of mundane embarrassments, he turned with\r\nfresh enthusiasm to the skies, and his discoveries followed one another\r\nin bewildering profusion. He found various hitherto unseen moons of our\r\nsister planets; he made special studies of Saturn, and proved that this\r\nplanet, with its rings, revolves on its axis; he scanned the spots on\r\nthe sun, and suggested that they influence the weather of our earth; in\r\nshort, he extended the entire field of solar astronomy. But very soon\r\nthis field became too small for him, and his most important researches\r\ncarried him out into the regions of space compared with which the span\r\nof our solar system is a mere point. With his perfected telescopes he\r\nentered abysmal vistas which no human eve ever penetrated before, which\r\nno human mind had hitherto more than vaguely imagined. He tells us that\r\nhis forty-foot reflector will bring him light from a distance of \"at\r\nleast eleven and three-fourths millions of millions of millions of\r\nmiles\"--light which left its source two million years ago. The smallest\r\nstars visible to the unaided eye are those of the sixth magnitude; this\r\ntelescope, he thinks, has power to reveal stars of the 1342d magnitude.\r\n\r\nBut what did Herschel learn regarding these awful depths of space and\r\nthe stars that people them? That was what the world wished to know.\r\nCopernicus, Galileo, Kepler, had given us a solar system, but the stars\r\nhad been a mystery. What says the great reflector--are the stars points\r\nof light, as the ancients taught, and as more than one philosopher of\r\nthe eighteenth century has still contended, or are they suns, as others\r\nhold? Herschel answers, they are suns, each and every one of all the\r\nmillions--suns, many of them, larger than the one that is the centre of\r\nour tiny system. Not only so, but they are moving suns. Instead of\r\nbeing fixed in space, as has been thought, they are whirling in gigantic\r\norbits about some common centre. Is our sun that centre? Far from it.\r\nOur sun is only a star like all the rest, circling on with its attendant\r\nsatellites--our giant sun a star, no different from myriad other stars,\r\nnot even so large as some; a mere insignificant spark of matter in an\r\ninfinite shower of sparks.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. Looking beyond the few thousand stars that are visible\r\nto the naked eye, Herschel sees series after series of more distant\r\nstars, marshalled in galaxies of millions; but at last he reaches a\r\ndistance beyond which the galaxies no longer increase. And yet--so he\r\nthinks--he has not reached the limits of his vision. What then? He has\r\ncome to the bounds of the sidereal system--seen to the confines of the\r\nuniverse. He believes that he can outline this system, this universe,\r\nand prove that it has the shape of an irregular globe, oblately\r\nflattened to almost disklike proportions, and divided at one edge--a\r\nbifurcation that is revealed even to the naked eye in the forking of the\r\nMilky Way.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is our universe as Herschel conceives it--a vast galaxy\r\nof suns, held to one centre, revolving, poised in space. But even\r\nhere those marvellous telescopes do not pause. Far, far out beyond the\r\nconfines of our universe, so far that the awful span of our own system\r\nmight serve as a unit of measure, are revealed other systems, other\r\nuniverses, like our own, each composed, as he thinks, of myriads of\r\nsuns, clustered like our galaxy into an isolated system--mere islands of\r\nmatter in an infinite ocean of space. So distant from our universe are\r\nthese now universes of Herschel's discovery that their light reaches\r\nus only as a dim, nebulous glow, in most cases invisible to the unaided\r\neye. About a hundred of these nebulae were known when Herschel began\r\nhis studies. Before the close of the century he had discovered about\r\ntwo thousand more of them, and many of these had been resolved by his\r\nlargest telescopes into clusters of stars. He believed that the farthest\r\nof these nebulae that he could see was at least three hundred thousand\r\ntimes as distant from us as the nearest fixed star. Yet that nearest\r\nstar--so more recent studies prove--is so remote that its light,\r\ntravelling one hundred and eighty thousand miles a second, requires\r\nthree and one-half years to reach our planet.\r\n\r\nAs if to give the finishing touches to this novel scheme of cosmology,\r\nHerschel, though in the main very little given to unsustained\r\ntheorizing, allows himself the privilege of one belief that he cannot\r\ncall upon his telescope to substantiate. He thinks that all the myriad\r\nsuns of his numberless systems are instinct with life in the human\r\nsense. Giordano Bruno and a long line of his followers had held that\r\nsome of our sister planets may be inhabited, but Herschel extends\r\nthe thought to include the moon, the sun, the stars--all the heavenly\r\nbodies. He believes that he can demonstrate the habitability of our own\r\nsun, and, reasoning from analogy, he is firmly convinced that all the\r\nsuns of all the systems are \"well supplied with inhabitants.\" In this,\r\nas in some other inferences, Herschel is misled by the faulty physics\r\nof his time. Future generations, working with perfected instruments, may\r\nnot sustain him all along the line of his observations, even, let alone\r\nhis inferences. But how one's egotism shrivels and shrinks as one grasps\r\nthe import of his sweeping thoughts!\r\n\r\nContinuing his observations of the innumerable nebulae, Herschel is led\r\npresently to another curious speculative inference. He notes that some\r\nstar groups are much more thickly clustered than others, and he is\r\nled to infer that such varied clustering tells of varying ages of the\r\ndifferent nebulae. He thinks that at first all space may have been\r\nevenly sprinkled with the stars and that the grouping has resulted from\r\nthe action of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\"That the Milky Way is a most extensive stratum of stars of various\r\nsizes admits no longer of lasting doubt,\" he declares, \"and that our sun\r\nis actually one of the heavenly bodies belonging to it is as evident. I\r\nhave now viewed and gauged this shining zone in almost every direction\r\nand find it composed of stars whose number... constantly increases and\r\ndecreases in proportion to its apparent brightness to the naked eye.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose numberless stars of various sizes, scattered over an\r\nindefinite portion of space in such a manner as to be almost equally\r\ndistributed throughout the whole. The laws of attraction which no doubt\r\nextend to the remotest regions of the fixed stars will operate in such a\r\nmanner as most probably to produce the following effects:\r\n\r\n\"In the first case, since we have supposed the stars to be of various\r\nsizes, it will happen that a star, being considerably larger than its\r\nneighboring ones, will attract them more than they will be attracted by\r\nothers that are immediately around them; by which means they will be,\r\nin time, as it were, condensed about a centre, or, in other words, form\r\nthemselves into a cluster of stars of almost a globular figure, more\r\nor less regular according to the size and distance of the surrounding\r\nstars....\r\n\r\n\"The next case, which will also happen almost as frequently as the\r\nformer, is where a few stars, though not superior in size to the rest,\r\nmay chance to be rather nearer one another than the surrounding ones,...\r\nand this construction admits of the utmost variety of shapes....\r\n\r\n\"From the composition and repeated conjunction of both the foregoing\r\nformations, a third may be derived when many large stars, or combined\r\nsmall ones, are spread in long, extended, regular, or crooked rows,\r\nstreaks, or branches; for they will also draw the surrounding stars, so\r\nas to produce figures of condensed stars curiously similar to the former\r\nwhich gave rise to these condensations.\r\n\r\n\"We may likewise admit still more extensive combinations; when, at the\r\nsame time that a cluster of stars is forming at the one part of\r\nspace, there may be another collection in a different but perhaps not\r\nfar-distant quarter, which may occasion a mutual approach towards their\r\nown centre of gravity.\r\n\r\n\"In the last place, as a natural conclusion of the former cases, there\r\nwill be formed great cavities or vacancies by the retreating of the\r\nstars towards the various centres which attract them.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward, it appears that the time must come when all the suns\r\nof a system will be drawn together and destroyed by impact at a common\r\ncentre. Already, it seems to Herschel, the thickest clusters have\r\n\"outlived their usefulness\" and are verging towards their doom.\r\n\r\nBut again, other nebulae present an appearance suggestive of an opposite\r\ncondition. They are not resolvable into stars, but present an almost\r\nuniform appearance throughout, and are hence believed to be composed of\r\na shining fluid, which in some instances is seen to be condensed at the\r\ncentre into a glowing mass. In such a nebula Herschel thinks he sees a\r\nsun in process of formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS OF KANT\r\n\r\nTaken together, these two conceptions outline a majestic cycle of world\r\nformation and world destruction--a broad scheme of cosmogony, such as\r\nhad been vaguely adumbrated two centuries before by Kepler and in\r\nmore recent times by Wright and Swedenborg. This so-called \"nebular\r\nhypothesis\" assumes that in the beginning all space was uniformly filled\r\nwith cosmic matter in a state of nebular or \"fire-mist\" diffusion,\r\n\"formless and void.\" It pictures the condensation--coagulation, if\r\nyou will--of portions of this mass to form segregated masses, and the\r\nultimate development out of these masses of the sidereal bodies that we\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first elaborate exposition of this idea was that given by\r\nthe great German philosopher Immanuel Kant (born at Konigsberg in 1724,\r\ndied in 1804), known to every one as the author of the Critique of Pure\r\nReason. Let us learn from his own words how the imaginative philosopher\r\nconceived the world to have come into existence.\r\n\r\n\"I assume,\" says Kant, \"that all the material of which the globes\r\nbelonging to our solar system--all the planets and comets--consist, at\r\nthe beginning of all things was decomposed into its primary elements,\r\nand filled the whole space of the universe in which the bodies formed\r\nout of it now revolve. This state of nature, when viewed in and by\r\nitself without any reference to a system, seems to be the very simplest\r\nthat can follow upon nothing. At that time nothing has yet been formed.\r\nThe construction of heavenly bodies at a distance from one another,\r\ntheir distances regulated by their attraction, their form arising out of\r\nthe equilibrium of their collected matter, exhibit a later state.... In\r\na region of space filled in this manner, a universal repose could last\r\nonly a moment. The elements have essential forces with which to put\r\neach other in motion, and thus are themselves a source of life. Matter\r\nimmediately begins to strive to fashion itself. The scattered elements\r\nof a denser kind, by means of their attraction, gather from a sphere\r\naround them all the matter of less specific gravity; again, these\r\nelements themselves, together with the material which they have united\r\nwith them, collect in those points where the particles of a still denser\r\nkind are found; these in like manner join still denser particles, and\r\nso on. If we follow in imagination this process by which nature fashions\r\nitself into form through the whole extent of chaos, we easily perceive\r\nthat all the results of the process would consist in the formation of\r\ndivers masses which, when their formation was complete, would by the\r\nequality of their attraction be at rest and be forever unmoved.\r\n\r\n\"But nature has other forces in store which are specially exerted when\r\nmatter is decomposed into fine particles. They are those forces by which\r\nthese particles repel one another, and which, by their conflict with\r\nattractions, bring forth that movement which is, as it were, the lasting\r\nlife of nature. This force of repulsion is manifested in the elasticity\r\nof vapors, the effluences of strong-smelling bodies, and the diffusion\r\nof all spirituous matters. This force is an uncontestable phenomenon of\r\nmatter. It is by it that the elements, which may be falling to the point\r\nattracting them, are turned sideways promiscuously from their movement\r\nin a straight line; and their perpendicular fall thereby issues in\r\ncircular movements, which encompass the centre towards which they were\r\nfalling. In order to make the formation of the world more distinctly\r\nconceivable, we will limit our view by withdrawing it from the infinite\r\nuniverse of nature and directing it to a particular system, as the\r\none which belongs to our sun. Having considered the generation of this\r\nsystem, we shall be able to advance to a similar consideration of the\r\norigin of the great world-systems, and thus to embrace the infinitude of\r\nthe whole creation in one conception.\r\n\r\n\"From what has been said, it will appear that if a point is situated in\r\na very large space where the attraction of the elements there situated\r\nacts more strongly than elsewhere, then the matter of the elementary\r\nparticles scattered throughout the whole region will fall to that point.\r\nThe first effect of this general fall is the formation of a body at this\r\ncentre of attraction, which, so to speak, grows from an infinitely\r\nsmall nucleus by rapid strides; and in the proportion in which this mass\r\nincreases, it also draws with greater force the surrounding particles\r\nto unite with it. When the mass of this central body has grown so great\r\nthat the velocity with which it draws the particles to itself with great\r\ndistances is bent sideways by the feeble degree of repulsion with which\r\nthey impede one another, and when it issues in lateral movements which\r\nare capable by means of the centrifugal force of encompassing the\r\ncentral body in an orbit, then there are produced whirls or vortices\r\nof particles, each of which by itself describes a curved line by the\r\ncomposition of the attracting force and the force of revolution that had\r\nbeen bent sideways. These kinds of orbits all intersect one another,\r\nfor which their great dispersion in this space gives place. Yet these\r\nmovements are in many ways in conflict with one another, and they\r\nnaturally tend to bring one another to a uniformity--that is, into a\r\nstate in which one movement is as little obstructive to the other as\r\npossible. This happens in two ways: first by the particles limiting\r\none another's movement till they all advance in one direction; and,\r\nsecondly, in this way, that the particles limit their vertical movements\r\nin virtue of which they are approaching the centre of attraction, till\r\nthey all move horizontally--i. e., in parallel circles round the sun as\r\ntheir centre, no longer intercept one another, and by the centrifugal\r\nforce becoming equal with the falling force they keep themselves\r\nconstantly in free circular orbits at the distance at which they move.\r\nThe result, finally, is that only those particles continue to move in\r\nthis region of space which have acquired by their fall a velocity, and\r\nthrough the resistance of the other particles a direction, by which they\r\ncan continue to maintain a FREE CIRCULAR MOVEMENT....\r\n\r\n\"The view of the formation of the planets in this system has the\r\nadvantage over every other possible theory in holding that the origin\r\nof the movements, and the position of the orbits in arising at that same\r\npoint of time--nay, more, in showing that even the deviations from the\r\ngreatest possible exactness in their determinations, as well as the\r\naccordances themselves, become clear at a glance. The planets are formed\r\nout of particles which, at the distance at which they move, have exact\r\nmovements in circular orbits; and therefore the masses composed out of\r\nthem will continue the same movements and at the same rate and in the\r\nsame direction.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this explanation leaves a good deal to be\r\ndesired. It is the explanation of a metaphysician rather than that of\r\nan experimental scientist. Such phrases as \"matter immediately begins to\r\nstrive to fashion itself,\" for example, have no place in the reasoning\r\nof inductive science. Nevertheless, the hypothesis of Kant is a\r\nremarkable conception; it attempts to explain along rational lines\r\nsomething which hitherto had for the most part been considered\r\naltogether inexplicable.\r\n\r\nBut there are various questions that at once suggest themselves which\r\nthe Kantian theory leaves unanswered. How happens it, for example, that\r\nthe cosmic mass which gave birth to our solar system was divided into\r\nseveral planetary bodies instead of remaining a single mass? Were the\r\nplanets struck from the sun by the chance impact of comets, as Buffon\r\nhas suggested? or thrown out by explosive volcanic action, in accordance\r\nwith the theory of Dr. Darwin? or do they owe their origin to some\r\nunknown law? In any event, how chanced it that all were projected in\r\nnearly the same plane as we now find them?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPLACE AND THE NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS\r\n\r\nIt remained for a mathematical astronomer to solve these puzzles. The\r\nman of all others competent to take the subject in hand was the French\r\nastronomer Laplace. For a quarter of a century he had devoted his\r\ntranscendent mathematical abilities to the solution of problems of\r\nmotion of the heavenly bodies. Working in friendly rivalry with his\r\ncountryman Lagrange, his only peer among the mathematicians of the age,\r\nhe had taken up and solved one by one the problems that Newton left\r\nobscure. Largely through the efforts of these two men the last lingering\r\ndoubts as to the solidarity of the Newtonian hypothesis of universal\r\ngravitation had been removed. The share of Lagrange was hardly less than\r\nthat of his co-worker; but Laplace will longer be remembered, because\r\nhe ultimately brought his completed labors into a system, and,\r\nincorporating with them the labors of his contemporaries, produced\r\nin the Mecanique Celeste the undisputed mathematical monument of the\r\ncentury, a fitting complement to the Principia of Newton, which it\r\nsupplements and in a sense completes.\r\n\r\nIn the closing years of the eighteenth century Laplace took up the\r\nnebular hypothesis of cosmogony, to which we have just referred, and\r\ngave it definite proportions; in fact, made it so thoroughly his own\r\nthat posterity will always link it with his name. Discarding the crude\r\nnotions of cometary impact and volcanic eruption, Laplace filled up the\r\ngaps in the hypothesis with the aid of well-known laws of gravitation\r\nand motion. He assumed that the primitive mass of cosmic matter which\r\nwas destined to form our solar system was revolving on its axis even at\r\na time when it was still nebular in character, and filled all space to\r\na distance far beyond the present limits of the system. As this vaporous\r\nmass contracted through loss of heat, it revolved more and more swiftly,\r\nand from time to time, through balance of forces at its periphery, rings\r\nof its substance were whirled off and left revolving there, subsequently\r\nto become condensed into planets, and in their turn whirl off minor\r\nrings that became moons. The main body of the original mass remains in\r\nthe present as the still contracting and rotating body which we call the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nLet us allow Laplace to explain all this in detail:\r\n\r\n\"In order to explain the prime movements of the planetary system,\"\r\nhe says, \"there are the five following phenomena: The movement of the\r\nplanets in the same direction and very nearly in the same plane; the\r\nmovement of the satellites in the same direction as that of the planets;\r\nthe rotation of these different bodies and the sun in the same\r\ndirection as their revolution, and in nearly the same plane; the slight\r\neccentricity of the orbits of the planets and of the satellites; and,\r\nfinally, the great eccentricity of the orbits of the comets, as if their\r\ninclinations had been left to chance.\r\n\r\n\"Buffon is the only man I know who, since the discovery of the true\r\nsystem of the world, has endeavored to show the origin of the planets\r\nand their satellites. He supposes that a comet, in falling into the sun,\r\ndrove from it a mass of matter which was reassembled at a distance in\r\nthe form of various globes more or less large, and more or less removed\r\nfrom the sun, and that these globes, becoming opaque and solid, are now\r\nthe planets and their satellites.\r\n\r\n\"This hypothesis satisfies the first of the five preceding phenomena;\r\nfor it is clear that all the bodies thus formed would move very nearly\r\nin the plane which passed through the centre of the sun, and in the\r\ndirection of the torrent of matter which was produced; but the four\r\nother phenomena appear to be inexplicable to me by this means. Indeed,\r\nthe absolute movement of the molecules of a planet ought then to be in\r\nthe direction of the movement of its centre of gravity; but it does not\r\nat all follow that the motion of the rotation of the planets should be\r\nin the same direction. Thus the earth should rotate from east to west,\r\nbut nevertheless the absolute movement of its molecules should be\r\nfrom east to west; and this ought also to apply to the movement of the\r\nrevolution of the satellites, in which the direction, according to the\r\nhypothesis which he offers, is not necessarily the same as that of the\r\nprogressive movement of the planets.\r\n\r\n\"A phenomenon not only very difficult to explain under this hypothesis,\r\nbut one which is even contrary to it, is the slight eccentricity of the\r\nplanetary orbits. We know, by the theory of central forces, that if\r\na body moves in a closed orbit around the sun and touches it, it also\r\nalways comes back to that point at every revolution; whence it follows\r\nthat if the planets were originally detached from the sun, they would\r\ntouch it at each return towards it, and their orbits, far from being\r\ncircular, would be very eccentric. It is true that a mass of matter\r\ndriven from the sun cannot be exactly compared to a globe which touches\r\nits surface, for the impulse which the particles of this mass receive\r\nfrom one another and the reciprocal attractions which they exert among\r\nthemselves, could, in changing the direction of their movements, remove\r\ntheir perihelions from the sun; but their orbits would be always most\r\neccentric, or at least they would not have slight eccentricities except\r\nby the most extraordinary chance. Thus we cannot see, according to\r\nthe hypothesis of Buffon, why the orbits of more than a hundred comets\r\nalready observed are so elliptical. This hypothesis is therefore\r\nvery far from satisfying the preceding phenomena. Let us see if it is\r\npossible to trace them back to their true cause.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be its ultimate nature, seeing that it has caused or\r\nmodified the movements of the planets, it is necessary that this cause\r\nshould embrace every body, and, in view of the enormous distances which\r\nseparate them, it could only have been a fluid of immense extent.\r\nIn order to have given them an almost circular movement in the same\r\ndirection around the sun, it is necessary that this fluid should\r\nhave enveloped the sun as in an atmosphere. The consideration of the\r\nplanetary movements leads us then to think that, on account of excessive\r\nheat, the atmosphere of the sun originally extended beyond the orbits of\r\nall the planets, and that it was successively contracted to its present\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\"In the primitive condition in which we suppose the sun to have been, it\r\nresembled a nebula such as the telescope shows is composed of a nucleus\r\nmore or less brilliant, surrounded by a nebulosity which, on condensing\r\nitself towards the centre, forms a star. If it is conceived by analogy\r\nthat all the stars were formed in this manner, it is possible to imagine\r\ntheir previous condition of nebulosity, itself preceded by other states\r\nin which the nebulous matter was still more diffused, the nucleus being\r\nless and less luminous. By going back as far as possible, we thus\r\narrive at a nebulosity so diffused that its existence could hardly be\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time the peculiar disposition of certain stars, visible\r\nto the unaided eye, has struck philosophical observers. Mitchell\r\nhas already remarked how little probable it is that the stars in the\r\nPleiades, for example, could have been contracted into the small\r\nspace which encloses them by the fortuity of chance alone, and he has\r\nconcluded that this group of stars, and similar groups which the skies\r\npresent to us, are the necessary result of the condensation of a nebula,\r\nwith several nuclei, and it is evident that a nebula, by continually\r\ncontracting, towards these various nuclei, at length would form a group\r\nof stars similar to the Pleiades. The condensation of a nebula with two\r\nnuclei would form a system of stars close together, turning one upon\r\nthe other, such as those double stars of which we already know the\r\nrespective movements.\r\n\r\n\"But how did the solar atmosphere determine the movements of the\r\nrotation and revolution of the planets and satellites? If these bodies\r\nhad penetrated very deeply into this atmosphere, its resistance would\r\nhave caused them to fall into the sun. We can therefore conjecture that\r\nthe planets were formed at their successive limits by the condensation\r\nof a zone of vapors which the sun, on cooling, left behind, in the plane\r\nof his equator.\r\n\r\n\"Let us recall the results which we have given in a preceding chapter.\r\nThe atmosphere of the sun could not have extended indefinitely. Its\r\nlimit was the point where the centrifugal force due to its movement\r\nof rotation balanced its weight. But in proportion as the cooling\r\ncontracted the atmosphere, and those molecules which were near to them\r\ncondensed upon the surface of the body, the movement of the rotation\r\nincreased; for, on account of the Law of Areas, the sum of the areas\r\ndescribed by the vector of each molecule of the sun and its atmosphere\r\nand projected in the plane of the equator being always the same, the\r\nrotation should increase when these molecules approach the centre of the\r\nsun. The centrifugal force due to this movement becoming thus larger,\r\nthe point where the weight is equal to it is nearer the sun. Supposing,\r\nthen, as it is natural to admit, that the atmosphere extended at some\r\nperiod to its very limits, it should, on cooling, leave molecules behind\r\nat this limit and at limits successively occasioned by the increased\r\nrotation of the sun. The abandoned molecules would continue to revolve\r\naround this body, since their centrifugal force was balanced by their\r\nweight. But this equilibrium not arising in regard to the atmospheric\r\nmolecules parallel to the solar equator, the latter, on account of their\r\nweight, approached the atmosphere as they condensed, and did not cease\r\nto belong to it until by this motion they came upon the equator.\r\n\r\n\"Let us consider now the zones of vapor successively left behind. These\r\nzones ought, according to appearance, by the condensation and mutual\r\nattraction of their molecules, to form various concentric rings of vapor\r\nrevolving around the sun. The mutual gravitational friction of each ring\r\nwould accelerate some and retard others, until they had all acquired the\r\nsame angular velocity. Thus the actual velocity of the molecules most\r\nremoved from the sun would be the greatest. The following cause would\r\nalso operate to bring about this difference of speed. The molecules\r\nfarthest from the sun, and which by the effects of cooling and\r\ncondensation approached one another to form the outer part of the ring,\r\nwould have always described areas proportional to the time since the\r\ncentral force by which they were controlled has been constantly directed\r\ntowards this body. But this constancy of areas necessitates an increase\r\nof velocity proportional to the distance. It is thus seen that the same\r\ncause would diminish the velocity of the molecules which form the inner\r\npart of the ring.\r\n\r\n\"If all the molecules of the ring of vapor continued to condense without\r\ndisuniting, they would at length form a ring either solid or fluid. But\r\nthis formation would necessitate such a regularity in every part of the\r\nring, and in its cooling, that this phenomenon is extremely rare; and\r\nthe solar system affords us, indeed, but one example--namely, in the\r\nring of Saturn. In nearly every case the ring of vapor was broken into\r\nseveral masses, each moving at similar velocities, and continuing to\r\nrotate at the same distance around the sun. These masses would take\r\na spheroid form with a rotatory movement in the direction of the\r\nrevolution, because their inner molecules had less velocity than the\r\nouter. Thus were formed so many planets in a condition of vapor. But\r\nif one of them were powerful enough to reunite successively by its\r\nattraction all the others around its centre of gravity, the ring of\r\nvapor would be thus transformed into a single spheroidical mass of\r\nvapor revolving around the sun with a rotation in the direction of its\r\nrevolution. The latter case has been that which is the most common, but\r\nnevertheless the solar system affords us an instance of the first case\r\nin the four small planets which move between Jupiter and Mars; at least,\r\nif we do not suppose, as does M. Olbers, that they originally formed a\r\nsingle planet which a mighty explosion broke up into several portions\r\neach moving at different velocities.\r\n\r\n\"According to our hypothesis, the comets are strangers to our planetary\r\nsystem. In considering them, as we have done, as minute nebulosities,\r\nwandering from solar system to solar system, and formed by the\r\ncondensation of the nebulous matter everywhere existent in profusion in\r\nthe universe, we see that when they come into that part of the heavens\r\nwhere the sun is all-powerful, he forces them to describe orbits either\r\nelliptical or hyperbolic, their paths being equally possible in all\r\ndirections, and at all inclinations of the ecliptic, conformably to what\r\nhas been observed. Thus the condensation of nebulous matter, by which\r\nwe have at first explained the motions of the rotation and revolution\r\nof the planets and their satellites in the same direction, and in nearly\r\napproximate planes, explains also why the movements of the comets escape\r\nthis general law.\"(3)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis thus given detailed completion by Laplace is a\r\nworthy complement of the grand cosmologic scheme of Herschel. Whether\r\ntrue or false, the two conceptions stand as the final contributions\r\nof the eighteenth century to the history of man's ceaseless efforts to\r\nsolve the mysteries of cosmic origin and cosmic structure. The world\r\nlistened eagerly and without prejudice to the new doctrines; and that\r\nattitude tells of a marvellous intellectual growth of our race. Mark the\r\ntransition. In the year 1600, Bruno was burned at the stake for teaching\r\nthat our earth is not the centre of the universe. In 1700, Newton was\r\npronounced \"impious and heretical\" by a large school of philosophers\r\nfor declaring that the force which holds the planets in their orbits\r\nis universal gravitation. In 1800, Laplace and Herschel are honored for\r\nteaching that gravitation built up the system which it still controls;\r\nthat our universe is but a minor nebula, our sun but a minor star, our\r\nearth a mere atom of matter, our race only one of myriad races peopling\r\nan infinity of worlds. Doctrines which but the span of two human lives\r\nbefore would have brought their enunciators to the stake were now\r\npronounced not impious, but sublime.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTEROIDS AND SATELLITES\r\n\r\nThe first day of the nineteenth century was fittingly signalized by the\r\ndiscovery of a new world. On the evening of January 1, 1801, an Italian\r\nastronomer, Piazzi, observed an apparent star of about the eighth\r\nmagnitude (hence, of course, quite invisible to the unaided eye), which\r\nlater on was seen to have moved, and was thus shown to be vastly nearer\r\nthe earth than any true star. He at first supposed, as Herschel had\r\ndone when he first saw Uranus, that the unfamiliar body was a comet; but\r\nlater observation proved it a tiny planet, occupying a position in space\r\nbetween Mars and Jupiter. It was christened Ceres, after the tutelary\r\ngoddess of Sicily.\r\n\r\nThough unpremeditated, this discovery was not unexpected, for\r\nastronomers had long surmised the existence of a planet in the wide\r\ngap between Mars and Jupiter. Indeed, they were even preparing to make\r\nconcerted search for it, despite the protests of philosophers, who\r\nargued that the planets could not possibly exceed the magic number\r\nseven, when Piazzi forestalled their efforts. But a surprise came\r\nwith the sequel; for the very next year Dr. Olbers, the wonderful\r\nphysician-astronomer of Bremen, while following up the course of Ceres,\r\nhappened on another tiny moving star, similarly located, which soon\r\nrevealed itself as planetary. Thus two planets were found where only one\r\nwas expected.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the supernumerary was a puzzle, but Olbers solved it\r\nfor the moment by suggesting that Ceres and Pallas, as he called his\r\ncaptive, might be fragments of a quondam planet, shattered by internal\r\nexplosion or by the impact of a comet. Other similar fragments, he\r\nventured to predict, would be found when searched for. William Herschel\r\nsanctioned this theory, and suggested the name asteroids for the tiny\r\nplanets. The explosion theory was supported by the discovery of another\r\nasteroid, by Harding, of Lilienthal, in 1804, and it seemed clinched\r\nwhen Olbers himself found a fourth in 1807. The new-comers were named\r\nJuno and Vesta respectively.\r\n\r\nThere the case rested till 1845, when a Prussian amateur astronomer\r\nnamed Hencke found another asteroid, after long searching, and opened a\r\nnew epoch of discovery. From then on the finding of asteroids became a\r\ncommonplace. Latterly, with the aid of photography, the list has been\r\nextended to above four hundred, and as yet there seems no dearth in the\r\nsupply, though doubtless all the larger members have been revealed. Even\r\nthese are but a few hundreds of miles in diameter, while the smaller\r\nones are too tiny for measurement. The combined bulk of these minor\r\nplanets is believed to be but a fraction of that of the earth.\r\n\r\nOlbers's explosion theory, long accepted by astronomers, has been\r\nproven open to fatal objections. The minor planets are now believed to\r\nrepresent a ring of cosmical matter, cast off from the solar nebula\r\nlike the rings that went to form the major planets, but prevented\r\nfrom becoming aggregated into a single body by the perturbing mass of\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of Neptune\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the discovery of the first asteroid confirmed a\r\nconjecture; the other important planetary discovery of the nineteenth\r\ncentury fulfilled a prediction. Neptune was found through scientific\r\nprophecy. No one suspected the existence of a trans-Uranian planet till\r\nUranus itself, by hair-breadth departures from its predicted orbit, gave\r\nout the secret. No one saw the disturbing planet till the pencil of the\r\nmathematician, with almost occult divination, had pointed out its place\r\nin the heavens. The general predication of a trans-Uranian planet was\r\nmade by Bessel, the great Konigsberg astronomer, in 1840; the analysis\r\nthat revealed its exact location was undertaken, half a decade later,\r\nby two independent workers--John Couch Adams, just graduated senior\r\nwrangler at Cambridge, England, and U. J. J. Leverrier, the leading\r\nFrench mathematician of his generation.\r\n\r\nAdams's calculation was first begun and first completed. But it had one\r\nradical defect--it was the work of a young and untried man. So it found\r\nlodgment in a pigeon-hole of the desk of England's Astronomer Royal, and\r\nan opportunity was lost which English astronomers have never ceased to\r\nmourn. Had the search been made, an actual planet would have been seen\r\nshining there, close to the spot where the pencil of the mathematician\r\nhad placed its hypothetical counterpart. But the search was not made,\r\nand while the prophecy of Adams gathered dust in that regrettable\r\npigeon-hole, Leverrier's calculation was coming on, his tentative\r\nresults meeting full encouragement from Arago and other French savants.\r\nAt last the laborious calculations proved satisfactory, and, confident\r\nof the result, Leverrier sent to the Berlin observatory, requesting that\r\nsearch be made for the disturber of Uranus in a particular spot of the\r\nheavens. Dr. Galle received the request September 23, 1846. That very\r\nnight he turned his telescope to the indicated region, and there, within\r\na single degree of the suggested spot, he saw a seeming star, invisible\r\nto the unaided eye, which proved to be the long-sought planet,\r\nhenceforth to be known as Neptune. To the average mind, which finds\r\nsomething altogether mystifying about abstract mathematics, this was a\r\nfeat savoring of the miraculous.\r\n\r\nStimulated by this success, Leverrier calculated an orbit for an\r\ninterior planet from perturbations of Mercury, but though prematurely\r\nchristened Vulcan, this hypothetical nursling of the sun still haunts\r\nthe realm of the undiscovered, along with certain equally hypothetical\r\ntrans-Neptunian planets whose existence has been suggested by \"residual\r\nperturbations\" of Uranus, and by the movements of comets. No other\r\nveritable additions of the sun's planetary family have been made in our\r\ncentury, beyond the finding of seven small moons, which chiefly attest\r\nthe advance in telescopic powers. Of these, the tiny attendants of our\r\nMartian neighbor, discovered by Professor Hall with the great Washington\r\nrefractor, are of greatest interest, because of their small size and\r\nextremely rapid flight. One of them is poised only six thousand\r\nmiles from Mars, and whirls about him almost four times as fast as he\r\nrevolves, seeming thus, as viewed by the Martian, to rise in the west\r\nand set in the east, and making the month only one-fourth as long as the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rings of Saturn\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the inner or crape ring of Saturn, made simultaneously\r\nin 1850 by William C. Bond, at the Harvard observatory, in America,\r\nand the Rev. W. R. Dawes in England, was another interesting optical\r\nachievement; but our most important advances in knowledge of Saturn's\r\nunique system are due to the mathematician. Laplace, like his\r\npredecessors, supposed these rings to be solid, and explained their\r\nstability as due to certain irregularities of contour which Herschel\r\nbad pointed out. But about 1851 Professor Peirce, of Harvard, showed\r\nthe untenability of this conclusion, proving that were the rings such as\r\nLaplace thought them they must fall of their own weight. Then Professor\r\nJ. Clerk-Maxwell, of Cambridge, took the matter in hand, and his\r\nanalysis reduced the puzzling rings to a cloud of meteoric particles--a\r\n\"shower of brickbats\"--each fragment of which circulates exactly as if\r\nit were an independent planet, though of course perturbed and jostled\r\nmore or less by its fellows. Mutual perturbations, and the disturbing\r\npulls of Saturn's orthodox satellites, as investigated by Maxwell,\r\nexplain nearly all the phenomena of the rings in a manner highly\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nAfter elaborate mathematical calculations covering many pages of his\r\npaper entitled \"On the Stability of Saturn's Rings,\" he summarizes his\r\ndeductions as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Let us now gather together the conclusions we have been able to draw\r\nfrom the mathematical theory of various kinds of conceivable rings.\r\n\r\n\"We found that the stability of the motion of a solid ring depended\r\non so delicate an adjustment, and at the same time so unsymmetrical a\r\ndistribution of mass, that even if the exact conditions were fulfilled,\r\nit could scarcely last long, and, if it did, the immense preponderance\r\nof one side of the ring would be easily observed, contrary to\r\nexperience. These considerations, with others derived from the\r\nmechanical structure of so vast a body, compel us to abandon any theory\r\nof solid rings.\r\n\r\n\"We next examined the motion of a ring of equal satellites, and found\r\nthat if the mass of the planet is sufficient, any disturbances produced\r\nin the arrangement of the ring will be propagated around it in the form\r\nof waves, and will not introduce dangerous confusion. If the satellites\r\nare unequal, the propagations of the waves will no longer be regular,\r\nbut disturbances of the ring will in this, as in the former case,\r\nproduce only waves, and not growing confusion. Supposing the ring to\r\nconsist, not of a single row of large satellites, but a cloud of evenly\r\ndistributed unconnected particles, we found that such a cloud must\r\nhave a very small density in order to be permanent, and that this is\r\ninconsistent with its outer and inner parts moving with the same angular\r\nvelocity. Supposing the ring to be fluid and continuous, we found that\r\nit will be necessarily broken up into small portions.\r\n\r\n\"We conclude, therefore, that the rings must consist of disconnected\r\nparticles; these must be either solid or liquid, but they must be\r\nindependent. The entire system of rings must, therefore, consist either\r\nof a series of many concentric rings each moving with its own velocity\r\nand having its own system of waves, or else of a confused multitude of\r\nrevolving particles not arranged in rings and continually coming into\r\ncollision with one another.\r\n\r\n\"Taking the first case, we found that in an indefinite number of\r\npossible cases the mutual perturbations of two rings, stable in\r\nthemselves, might mount up in time to a destructive magnitude, and that\r\nsuch cases must continually occur in an extensive system like that of\r\nSaturn, the only retarding cause being the irregularity of the rings.\r\n\r\n\"The result of long-continued disturbance was found to be the\r\nspreading-out of the rings in breadth, the outer rings pressing outward,\r\nwhile the inner rings press inward.\r\n\r\n\"The final result, therefore, of the mechanical theory is that the only\r\nsystem of rings which can exist is one composed of an indefinite number\r\nof unconnected particles, revolving around the planet with different\r\nvelocities, according to their respective distances. These particles\r\nmay be arranged in series of narrow rings, or they may move through one\r\nanother irregularly. In the first case the destruction of the system\r\nwill be very slow, in the second case it will be more rapid, but there\r\nmay be a tendency towards arrangement in narrow rings which may retard\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\n\"We are not able to ascertain by observation the constitution of the two\r\nouter divisions of the system of rings, but the inner ring is certainly\r\ntransparent, for the limb of Saturn has been observed through it. It is\r\nalso certain that though the space occupied by the ring is transparent,\r\nit is not through the material parts of it that the limb of Saturn is\r\nseen, for his limb was observed without distortion; which shows that\r\nthere was no refraction, and, therefore, that the rays did not pass\r\nthrough a medium at all, but between the solar or liquid particles of\r\nwhich the ring is composed. Here, then, we have an optical argument\r\nin favor of the theory of independent particles as the material of\r\nthe rings. The two outer rings may be of the same nature, but not\r\nso exceedingly rare that a ray of light can pass through their whole\r\nthickness without encountering one of the particles.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, the two outer rings have been observed for two hundred years,\r\nand it appears, from the careful analysis of all the observations of M.\r\nStruve, that the second ring is broader than when first observed, and\r\nthat its inner edge is nearer the planet than formerly. The inner ring\r\nalso is suspected to be approaching the planet ever since its discovery\r\nin 1850. These appearances seem to indicate the same slow progress of\r\nthe rings towards separation which we found to be the result of theory,\r\nand the remark that the inner edge of the inner ring is more distinct\r\nseems to indicate that the approach towards the planet is less rapid\r\nnear the edge, as we had reason to conjecture. As to the apparent\r\nunchangeableness of the exterior diameter of the outer ring, we must\r\nremember that the outer rings are certainly far more dense than the\r\ninner one, and that a small change in the outer rings must balance a\r\ngreat change in the inner one. It is possible, however, that some of the\r\nobserved changes may be due to the existence of a resisting medium.\r\nIf the changes already suspected should be confirmed by repeated\r\nobservations with the same instruments, it will be worth while to\r\ninvestigate more carefully whether Saturn's rings are permanent or\r\ntransitory elements of the solar system, and whether in that part of\r\nthe heavens we see celestial immutability or terrestrial corruption\r\nand generation, and the old order giving place to the new before our\r\neyes.\"(4)\r\n\r\n\r\nStudies of the Moon\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting accomplishments of mathematical\r\nastronomy--from a mundane standpoint, at any rate--are those that refer\r\nto the earth's own satellite. That seemingly staid body was long ago\r\ndiscovered to have a propensity to gain a little on the earth, appearing\r\nat eclipses an infinitesimal moment ahead of time. Astronomers were\r\nsorely puzzled by this act of insubordination; but at last Laplace and\r\nLagrange explained it as due to an oscillatory change in the earth's\r\norbit, thus fully exonerating the moon, and seeming to demonstrate the\r\nabsolute stability of our planetary system, which the moon's misbehavior\r\nhad appeared to threaten.\r\n\r\nThis highly satisfactory conclusion was an orthodox belief of celestial\r\nmechanics until 1853, when Professor Adams of Neptunian fame, with whom\r\ncomplex analyses were a pastime, reviewed Laplace's calculation, and\r\ndiscovered an error which, when corrected, left about half the moon's\r\nacceleration unaccounted for. This was a momentous discrepancy, which at\r\nfirst no one could explain. But presently Professor Helmholtz, the great\r\nGerman physicist, suggested that a key might be found in tidal friction,\r\nwhich, acting as a perpetual brake on the earth's rotation, and\r\naffecting not merely the waters but the entire substance of our planet,\r\nmust in the long sweep of time have changed its rate of rotation. Thus\r\nthe seeming acceleration of the moon might be accounted for as actual\r\nretardation of the earth's rotation--a lengthening of the day instead of\r\na shortening of the month.\r\n\r\nAgain the earth was shown to be at fault, but this time the moon could\r\nnot be exonerated, while the estimated stability of our system, instead\r\nof being re-established, was quite upset. For the tidal retardation is\r\nnot an oscillatory change which will presently correct itself, like the\r\norbital wobble, but a perpetual change, acting always in one direction.\r\nUnless fully counteracted by some opposing reaction, therefore (as\r\nit seems not to be), the effect must be cumulative, the ultimate\r\nconsequences disastrous. The exact character of these consequences was\r\nfirst estimated by Professor G. H. Darwin in 1879. He showed that tidal\r\nfriction, in retarding the earth, must also push the moon out from the\r\nparent planet on a spiral orbit. Plainly, then, the moon must formerly\r\nhave been nearer the earth than at present. At some very remote period\r\nit must have actually touched the earth; must, in other words, have been\r\nthrown off from the then plastic mass of the earth, as a polyp buds out\r\nfrom its parent polyp. At that time the earth was spinning about in a\r\nday of from two to four hours.\r\n\r\nNow the day has been lengthened to twenty-four hours, and the moon has\r\nbeen thrust out to a distance of a quarter-million miles; but the end is\r\nnot yet. The same progress of events must continue, till, at some remote\r\nperiod in the future, the day has come to equal the month, lunar tidal\r\naction has ceased, and one face of the earth looks out always at the\r\nmoon with that same fixed stare which even now the moon has been brought\r\nto assume towards her parent orb. Should we choose to take even greater\r\nliberties with the future, it may be made to appear (though some\r\nastronomers dissent from this prediction) that, as solar tidal action\r\nstill continues, the day must finally exceed the month, and lengthen out\r\nlittle by little towards coincidence with the year; and that the moon\r\nmeantime must pause in its outward flight, and come swinging back on a\r\ndescending spiral, until finally, after the lapse of untold aeons, it\r\nploughs and ricochets along the surface of the earth, and plunges to\r\ncatastrophic destruction.\r\n\r\nBut even though imagination pause far short of this direful culmination,\r\nit still is clear that modern calculations, based on inexorable tidal\r\nfriction, suffice to revolutionize the views formerly current as to the\r\nstability of the planetary system. The eighteenth-century mathematician\r\nlooked upon this system as a vast celestial machine which had been in\r\nexistence about six thousand years, and which was destined to run on\r\nforever. The analyst of to-day computes both the past and the future of\r\nthis system in millions instead of thousands of years, yet feels well\r\nassured that the solar system offers no contradiction to those laws of\r\ngrowth and decay which seem everywhere to represent the immutable order\r\nof nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMETS AND METEORS\r\n\r\nUntil the mathematician ferreted out the secret, it surely never could\r\nhave been suspected by any one that the earth's serene attendant,\r\n\r\n     \"That orbed maiden, with white fire laden,\r\n     Whom mortals call the moon,\"\r\n\r\ncould be plotting injury to her parent orb. But there is another\r\ninhabitant of the skies whose purposes have not been similarly free from\r\npopular suspicion. Needless to say I refer to the black sheep of the\r\nsidereal family, that \"celestial vagabond\" the comet.\r\n\r\nTime out of mind these wanderers have been supposed to presage war,\r\nfamine, pestilence, perhaps the destruction of the world. And little\r\nwonder. Here is a body which comes flashing out of boundless space into\r\nour system, shooting out a pyrotechnic tail some hundreds of millions of\r\nmiles in length; whirling, perhaps, through the very atmosphere of the\r\nsun at a speed of three or four hundred miles a second; then darting off\r\non a hyperbolic orbit that forbids it ever to return, or an elliptical\r\none that cannot be closed for hundreds or thousands of years; the tail\r\nmeantime pointing always away from the sun, and fading to nothingness as\r\nthe weird voyager recedes into the spatial void whence it came. Not many\r\ntimes need the advent of such an apparition coincide with the outbreak\r\nof a pestilence or the death of a Caesar to stamp the race of comets as\r\nan ominous clan in the minds of all superstitious generations.\r\n\r\nIt is true, a hard blow was struck at the prestige of these alleged\r\nsupernatural agents when Newton proved that the great comet of 1680\r\nobeyed Kepler's laws in its flight about the sun; and an even harder\r\none when the same visitant came back in 1758, obedient to Halley's\r\nprediction, after its three-quarters of a century of voyaging but in\r\nthe abyss of space. Proved thus to bow to natural law, the celestial\r\nmessenger could no longer fully, sustain its role. But long-standing\r\nnotoriety cannot be lived down in a day, and the comet, though proved a\r\n\"natural\" object, was still regarded as a very menacing one for\r\nanother hundred years or so. It remained for the nineteenth century to\r\ncompletely unmask the pretender and show how egregiously our forebears\r\nhad been deceived.\r\n\r\nThe unmasking began early in the century, when Dr. Olbers, then the\r\nhighest authority on the subject, expressed the opinion that\r\nthe spectacular tail, which had all along been the comet's chief\r\nstock-in-trade as an earth-threatener, is in reality composed of\r\nthe most filmy vapors, repelled from the cometary body by the sun,\r\npresumably through electrical action, with a velocity comparable to that\r\nof light. This luminous suggestion was held more or less in abeyance for\r\nhalf a century. Then it was elaborated by Zollner, and particularly by\r\nBredichin, of the Moscow observatory, into what has since been regarded\r\nas the most plausible of cometary theories. It is held that comets\r\nand the sun are similarly electrified, and hence mutually repulsive.\r\nGravitation vastly outmatches this repulsion in the body of the comet,\r\nbut yields to it in the case of gases, because electrical force varies\r\nwith the surface, while gravitation varies only with the mass. From\r\nstudy of atomic weights and estimates of the velocity of thrust of\r\ncometary tails, Bredichin concluded that the chief components of the\r\nvarious kinds of tails are hydrogen, hydrocarbons, and the vapor of\r\niron; and spectroscopic analysis goes far towards sustaining these\r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\nBut, theories aside, the unsubstantialness of the comet's tail has been\r\nput to a conclusive test. Twice during the nineteenth century the\r\nearth has actually plunged directly through one of these threatening\r\nappendages--in 1819, and again in 1861, once being immersed to a depth\r\nof some three hundred thousand miles in its substance. Yet nothing\r\ndreadful happened to us. There was a peculiar glow in the atmosphere,\r\nso the more imaginative observers thought, and that was all. After such\r\nfiascos the cometary train could never again pose as a world-destroyer.\r\n\r\nBut the full measure of the comet's humiliation is not yet told. The\r\npyrotechnic tail, composed as it is of portions of the comet's actual\r\nsubstance, is tribute paid the sun, and can never be recovered. Should\r\nthe obeisance to the sun be many times repeated, the train-forming\r\nmaterial will be exhausted, and the comet's chiefest glory will have\r\ndeparted. Such a fate has actually befallen a multitude of comets which\r\nJupiter and the other outlying planets have dragged into our system and\r\nhelped the sun to hold captive here. Many of these tailless comets were\r\nknown to the eighteenth-century astronomers, but no one at that time\r\nsuspected the true meaning of their condition. It was not even known how\r\nclosely some of them are enchained until the German astronomer Encke,\r\nin 1822, showed that one which he had rediscovered, and which has\r\nsince borne his name, was moving in an orbit so contracted that it must\r\ncomplete its circuit in about three and a half years. Shortly afterwards\r\nanother comet, revolving in a period of about six years, was discovered\r\nby Biela, and given his name. Only two more of these short-period comets\r\nwere discovered during the first half of last century, but latterly they\r\nhave been shown to be a numerous family. Nearly twenty are known\r\nwhich the giant Jupiter holds so close that the utmost reach of their\r\nelliptical tether does not let them go beyond the orbit of Saturn. These\r\naforetime wanderers have adapted themselves wonderfully to planetary\r\ncustoms, for all of them revolve in the same direction with the planets,\r\nand in planes not wide of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nChecked in their proud hyperbolic sweep, made captive in a planetary\r\nnet, deprived of their trains, these quondam free-lances of the heavens\r\nare now mere shadows of their former selves. Considered as to mere\r\nbulk, they are very substantial shadows, their extent being measured in\r\nhundreds of thousands of miles; but their actual mass is so slight that\r\nthey are quite at the mercy of the gravitation pulls of their captors.\r\nAnd worse is in store for them. So persistently do sun and planets tug\r\nat them that they are doomed presently to be torn into shreds.\r\n\r\nSuch a fate has already overtaken one of them, under the very eyes of\r\nthe astronomers, within the relatively short period during which these\r\nill-fated comets have been observed. In 1832 Biela's comet passed quite\r\nnear the earth, as astronomers measure distance, and in doing so created\r\na panic on our planet. It did no greater harm than that, of course, and\r\npassed on its way as usual. The very next time it came within telescopic\r\nhail it was seen to have broken into two fragments. Six years later\r\nthese fragments were separated by many millions of miles; and in 1852,\r\nwhen the comet was due again, astronomers looked for it in vain. It had\r\nbeen completely shattered.\r\n\r\nWhat had become of the fragments? At that time no one positively knew.\r\nBut the question was to be answered presently. It chanced that just at\r\nthis period astronomers were paying much attention to a class of bodies\r\nwhich they had hitherto somewhat neglected, the familiar shooting-stars,\r\nor meteors. The studies of Professor Newton, of Yale, and Professor\r\nAdams, of Cambridge, with particular reference to the great\r\nmeteor-shower of November, 1866, which Professor Newton had predicted\r\nand shown to be recurrent at intervals of thirty-three years, showed\r\nthat meteors are not mere sporadic swarms of matter flying at random,\r\nbut exist in isolated swarms, and sweep about the sun in regular\r\nelliptical orbits.\r\n\r\nPresently it was shown by the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli that\r\none of these meteor swarms moves in the orbit of a previously observed\r\ncomet, and other coincidences of the kind were soon forthcoming. The\r\nconviction grew that meteor swarms are really the debris of comets; and\r\nthis conviction became a practical certainty when, in November, 1872,\r\nthe earth crossed the orbit of the ill-starred Biela, and a shower of\r\nmeteors came whizzing into our atmosphere in lieu of the lost comet.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last the full secret was out. The awe-inspiring comet, instead\r\nof being the planetary body it had all along been regarded, is really\r\nnothing more nor less than a great aggregation of meteoric particles,\r\nwhich have become clustered together out in space somewhere, and which\r\nby jostling one another or through electrical action become luminous. So\r\nwidely are the individual particles separated that the cometary body as\r\na whole has been estimated to be thousands of times less dense than the\r\nearth's atmosphere at sea-level. Hence the ease with which the comet may\r\nbe dismembered and its particles strung out into streaming swarms.\r\n\r\nSo thickly is the space we traverse strewn with this cometary dust\r\nthat the earth sweeps up, according to Professor Newcomb's estimate, a\r\nmillion tons of it each day. Each individual particle, perhaps no larger\r\nthan a millet seed, becomes a shooting-star, or meteor, as it burns to\r\nvapor in the earth's upper atmosphere. And if one tiny planet sweeps\r\nup such masses of this cosmic matter, the amount of it in the entire\r\nstretch of our system must be beyond all estimate. What a story it tells\r\nof the myriads of cometary victims that have fallen prey to the sun\r\nsince first he stretched his planetary net across the heavens!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIXED STARS\r\n\r\nWhen Biela's comet gave the inhabitants of the earth such a fright in\r\n1832, it really did not come within fifty millions of miles of us. Even\r\nthe great comet through whose filmy tail the earth passed in 1861 was\r\nitself fourteen millions of miles away. The ordinary mind, schooled to\r\nmeasure space by the tiny stretches of a pygmy planet, cannot grasp the\r\nimport of such distances; yet these are mere units of measure compared\r\nwith the vast stretches of sidereal space. Were the comet which hurtles\r\npast us at a speed of, say, a hundred miles a second to continue its\r\nmad flight unchecked straight into the void of space, it must fly on its\r\nfrigid way eight thousand years before it could reach the very nearest\r\nof our neighbor stars; and even then it would have penetrated but a\r\nmere arm's-length into the vistas where lie the dozen or so of sidereal\r\nresidents that are next beyond. Even to the trained mind such distances\r\nare only vaguely imaginable. Yet the astronomer of our century has\r\nreached out across this unthinkable void and brought back many a secret\r\nwhich our predecessors thought forever beyond human grasp.\r\n\r\nA tentative assault upon this stronghold of the stars was being made\r\nby Herschel at the beginning of the century. In 1802 that greatest of\r\nobserving astronomers announced to the Royal Society his discovery that\r\ncertain double stars had changed their relative positions towards one\r\nanother since he first carefully charted them twenty years before.\r\nHitherto it had been supposed that double stars were mere optical\r\neffects. Now it became clear that some of them, at any rate, are\r\ntrue \"binary systems,\" linked together presumably by gravitation and\r\nrevolving about one another. Halley had shown, three-quarters of a\r\ncentury before, that the stars have an actual or \"proper\" motion in\r\nspace; Herschel himself had proved that the sun shares this motion\r\nwith the other stars. Here was another shift of place, hitherto quite\r\nunsuspected, to be reckoned with by the astronomer in fathoming sidereal\r\nsecrets.\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble Stars\r\n\r\nWhen John Herschel, the only son and the worthy successor of the great\r\nastronomer, began star-gazing in earnest, after graduating senior\r\nwrangler at Cambridge, and making two or three tentative professional\r\nstarts in other directions to which his versatile genius impelled him,\r\nhis first extended work was the observation of his father's double\r\nstars. His studies, in which at first he had the collaboration of Mr.\r\nJames South, brought to light scores of hitherto unrecognized pairs, and\r\ngave fresh data for the calculation of the orbits of those longer\r\nknown. So also did the independent researches of F. G. W. Struve,\r\nthe enthusiastic observer of the famous Russian observatory at the\r\nuniversity of Dorpat, and subsequently at Pulkowa. Utilizing data\r\ngathered by these observers, M. Savary, of Paris, showed, in 1827, that\r\nthe observed elliptical orbits of the double stars are explicable by\r\nthe ordinary laws of gravitation, thus confirming the assumption that\r\nNewton's laws apply to these sidereal bodies. Henceforth there could be\r\nno reason to doubt that the same force which holds terrestrial objects\r\non our globe pulls at each and every particle of matter throughout the\r\nvisible universe.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer explorers of the double stars early found that the systems\r\ninto which the stars are linked are by no means confined to single\r\npairs. Often three or four stars are found thus closely connected into\r\ngravitation systems; indeed, there are all gradations between binary\r\nsystems and great clusters containing hundreds or even thousands of\r\nmembers. It is known, for example, that the familiar cluster of the\r\nPleiades is not merely an optical grouping, as was formerly supposed,\r\nbut an actual federation of associated stars, some two thousand five\r\nhundred in number, only a few of which are visible to the unaided eve.\r\nAnd the more carefully the motions of the stars are studied, the more\r\nevident it becomes that widely separated stars are linked together into\r\ninfinitely complex systems, as yet but little understood. At the same\r\ntime, all instrumental advances tend to resolve more and more seemingly\r\nsingle stars into close pairs and minor clusters. The two Herschels\r\nbetween them discovered some thousands of these close multiple systems;\r\nStruve and others increased the list to above ten thousand; and Mr.\r\nS. W. Burnham, of late years the most enthusiastic and successful of\r\ndouble-star pursuers, added a thousand new discoveries while he was\r\nstill an amateur in astronomy, and by profession the stenographer of a\r\nChicago court. Clearly the actual number of multiple stars is beyond all\r\npresent estimate.\r\n\r\nThe elder Herschel's early studies of double stars were undertaken in\r\nthe hope that these objects might aid him in ascertaining the actual\r\ndistance of a star, through measurement of its annual parallax--that\r\nis to say, of the angle which the diameter of the earth's orbit would\r\nsubtend as seen from the star. The expectation was not fulfilled. The\r\napparent shift of position of a star as viewed from opposite sides of\r\nthe earth's orbit, from which the parallax might be estimated, is so\r\nextremely minute that it proved utterly inappreciable, even to the\r\nalmost preternaturally acute vision of Herschel, with the aid of any\r\ninstrumental means then at command. So the problem of star distance\r\nallured and eluded him to the end, and he died in 1822 without seeing\r\nit even in prospect of solution. His estimate of the minimum distance of\r\nthe nearest star, based though it was on the fallacious test of apparent\r\nbrilliancy, was a singularly sagacious one, but it was at best a\r\nscientific guess, not a scientific measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Distance of the Stars\r\n\r\nJust about this time, however, a great optician came to the aid of the\r\nastronomers. Joseph Fraunhofer perfected the refracting telescope,\r\nas Herschel had perfected the reflector, and invented a wonderfully\r\naccurate \"heliometer,\" or sun-measurer. With the aid of these\r\ninstruments the old and almost infinitely difficult problem of star\r\ndistance was solved. In 1838 Bessel announced from the Konigsberg\r\nobservatory that he had succeeded, after months of effort, in detecting\r\nand measuring the parallax of a star. Similar claims had been made often\r\nenough before, always to prove fallacious when put to further test; but\r\nthis time the announcement carried the authority of one of the greatest\r\nastronomers of the age, and scepticism was silenced.\r\n\r\nNor did Bessel's achievement long await corroboration. Indeed, as so\r\noften happens in fields of discovery, two other workers had almost\r\nsimultaneously solved the same problem--Struve at Pulkowa, where the\r\ngreat Russian observatory, which so long held the palm over all others,\r\nhad now been established; and Thomas Henderson, then working at the\r\nCape of Good Hope, but afterwards the Astronomer Royal of Scotland.\r\nHenderson's observations had actual precedence in point of time, but\r\nBessel's measurements were so much more numerous and authoritative that\r\nhe has been uniformly considered as deserving the chief credit of the\r\ndiscovery, which priority of publication secured him.\r\n\r\nBy an odd chance, the star on which Henderson's observations were made,\r\nand consequently the first star the parallax of which was ever measured,\r\nis our nearest neighbor in sidereal space, being, indeed, some ten\r\nbillions of miles nearer than the one next beyond. Yet even this nearest\r\nstar is more than two hundred thousand times as remote from us as the\r\nsun. The sun's light flashes to the earth in eight minutes, and to\r\nNeptune in about three and a half hours, but it requires three and a\r\nhalf years to signal Alpha Centauri. And as for the great majority of\r\nthe stars, had they been blotted out of existence before the Christian\r\nera, we of to-day should still receive their light and seem to see them\r\njust as we do. When we look up to the sky, we study ancient history;\r\nwe do not see the stars as they ARE, but as they WERE years, centuries,\r\neven millennia ago.\r\n\r\nThe information derived from the parallax of a star by no means halts\r\nwith the disclosure of the distance of that body. Distance known, the\r\nproper motion of the star, hitherto only to be reckoned as so many\r\nseconds of arc, may readily be translated into actual speed of progress;\r\nrelative brightness becomes absolute lustre, as compared with the sun;\r\nand in the case of the double stars the absolute mass of the components\r\nmay be computed from the laws of gravitation. It is found that stars\r\ndiffer enormously among themselves in all these regards. As to speed,\r\nsome, like our sun, barely creep through space--compassing ten or twenty\r\nmiles a second, it is true, yet even at that rate only passing through\r\nthe equivalent of their own diameter in a day. At the other extreme,\r\namong measured stars, is one that moves two hundred miles a second; yet\r\neven this \"flying star,\" as seen from the earth, seems to change its\r\nplace by only about three and a half lunar diameters in a thousand\r\nyears. In brightness, some stars yield to the sun, while others surpass\r\nhim as the arc-light surpasses a candle. Arcturus, the brightest\r\nmeasured star, shines like two hundred suns; and even this giant orb is\r\ndim beside those other stars which are so distant that their parallax\r\ncannot be measured, yet which greet our eyes at first magnitude. As to\r\nactual bulk, of which apparent lustre furnishes no adequate test, some\r\nstars are smaller than the sun, while others exceed him hundreds or\r\nperhaps thousands of times. Yet one and all, so distant are they, remain\r\nmere disklike points of light before the utmost powers of the modern\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevelations of the Spectroscope\r\n\r\nAll this seems wonderful enough, but even greater things were in store.\r\nIn 1859 the spectroscope came upon the scene, perfected by Kirchhoff\r\nand Bunsen, along lines pointed out by Fraunhofer almost half a century\r\nbefore. That marvellous instrument, by revealing the telltale lines\r\nsprinkled across a prismatic spectrum, discloses the chemical nature\r\nand physical condition of any substance whose light is submitted to it,\r\ntelling its story equally well, provided the light be strong enough,\r\nwhether the luminous substance be near or far--in the same room or at\r\nthe confines of space. Clearly such an instrument must prove a veritable\r\nmagic wand in the hands of the astronomer.\r\n\r\nVery soon eager astronomers all over the world were putting the\r\nspectroscope to the test. Kirchhoff himself led the way, and Donati and\r\nFather Secchi in Italy, Huggins and Miller in England, and Rutherfurd in\r\nAmerica, were the chief of his immediate followers. The results exceeded\r\nthe dreams of the most visionary. At the very outset, in 1860, it was\r\nshown that such common terrestrial substances as sodium, iron, calcium,\r\nmagnesium, nickel, barium, copper, and zinc exist in the form of glowing\r\nvapors in the sun, and very soon the stars gave up a corresponding\r\nsecret. Since then the work of solar and sidereal analysis has gone on\r\nsteadily in the hands of a multitude of workers (prominent among whom,\r\nin this country, are Professor Young of Princeton, Professor Langley of\r\nWashington, and Professor Pickering of Harvard), and more than half\r\nthe known terrestrial elements have been definitely located in the sun,\r\nwhile fresh discoveries are in prospect.\r\n\r\nIt is true the sun also contains some seeming elements that are unknown\r\non the earth, but this is no matter for surprise. The modern chemist\r\nmakes no claim for his elements except that they have thus far resisted\r\nall human efforts to dissociate them; it would be nothing strange if\r\nsome of them, when subjected to the crucible of the sun, which is seen\r\nto vaporize iron, nickel, silicon, should fail to withstand the test.\r\nBut again, chemistry has by no means exhausted the resources of the\r\nearth's supply of raw material, and the substance which sends its\r\nmessage from a star may exist undiscovered in the dust we tread or in\r\nthe air we breathe. In the year 1895 two new terrestrial elements were\r\ndiscovered; but one of these had for years been known to the astronomer\r\nas a solar and suspected as a stellar element, and named helium because\r\nof its abundance in the sun. The spectroscope had reached out millions\r\nof miles into space and brought back this new element, and it took the\r\nchemist a score of years to discover that he had all along had samples\r\nof the same substance unrecognized in his sublunary laboratory. There\r\nis hardly a more picturesque fact than that in the entire history of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nBut the identity in substance of earth and sun and stars was not more\r\nclearly shown than the diversity of their existing physical conditions.\r\nIt was seen that sun and stars, far from being the cool, earthlike,\r\nhabitable bodies that Herschel thought them (surrounded by glowing\r\nclouds, and protected from undue heat by other clouds), are in truth\r\nseething caldrons of fiery liquid, or gas made viscid by condensation,\r\nwith lurid envelopes of belching flames. It was soon made clear, also,\r\nparticularly by the studies of Rutherfurd and of Secchi, that stars\r\ndiffer among themselves in exact constitution or condition. There are\r\nwhite or Sirian stars, whose spectrum revels in the lines of hydrogen;\r\nyellow or solar stars (our sun being the type), showing various metallic\r\nvapors; and sundry red stars, with banded spectra indicative of carbon\r\ncompounds; besides the purely gaseous stars of more recent discovery,\r\nwhich Professor Pickering had specially studied. Zollner's famous\r\ninterpretation of these diversities, as indicative of varying stages\r\nof cooling, has been called in question as to the exact sequence it\r\npostulates, but the general proposition that stars exist under widely\r\nvarying conditions of temperature is hardly in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that different star types mark varying stages of cooling\r\nhas the further support of modern physics, which has been unable to\r\ndemonstrate any way in which the sun's radiated energy may be restored,\r\nor otherwise made perpetual, since meteoric impact has been shown to\r\nbe--under existing conditions, at any rate--inadequate. In accordance\r\nwith the theory of Helmholtz, the chief supply of solar energy is held\r\nto be contraction of the solar mass itself; and plainly this must\r\nhave its limits. Therefore, unless some means as yet unrecognized is\r\nrestoring the lost energy to the stellar bodies, each of them must\r\ngradually lose its lustre, and come to a condition of solidification,\r\nseeming sterility, and frigid darkness. In the case of our own\r\nparticular star, according to the estimate of Lord Kelvin, such a\r\nculmination appears likely to occur within a period of five or six\r\nmillion years.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Astronomy of the Invisible\r\n\r\nBut by far the strongest support of such a forecast as this is furnished\r\nby those stellar bodies which even now appear to have cooled to the\r\nfinal stage of star development and ceased to shine. Of this class\r\nexamples in miniature are furnished by the earth and the smaller of its\r\ncompanion planets. But there are larger bodies of the same type out\r\nin stellar space--veritable \"dark stars\"--invisible, of course, yet\r\nnowadays clearly recognized.\r\n\r\nThe opening up of this \"astronomy of the invisible\" is another of the\r\ngreat achievements of the nineteenth century, and again it is Bessel\r\nto whom the honor of discovery is due. While testing his stars\r\nfor parallax; that astute observer was led to infer, from certain\r\nunexplained aberrations of motion, that various stars, Sirius himself\r\namong the number, are accompanied by invisible companions, and in\r\n1840 he definitely predicated the existence of such \"dark stars.\" The\r\ncorrectness of the inference was shown twenty years later, when Alvan\r\nClark, Jr., the American optician, while testing a new lens, discovered\r\nthe companion of Sirius, which proved thus to be faintly luminous. Since\r\nthen the existence of other and quite invisible star companions has been\r\nproved incontestably, not merely by renewed telescopic observations, but\r\nby the curious testimony of the ubiquitous spectroscope.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising accomplishments of that instrument is the\r\npower to record the flight of a luminous object directly in the line of\r\nvision. If the luminous body approaches swiftly, its Fraunhofer lines\r\nare shifted from their normal position towards the violet end of the\r\nspectrum; if it recedes, the lines shift in the opposite direction. The\r\nactual motion of stars whose distance is unknown may be measured in this\r\nway. But in certain cases the light lines are seen to oscillate on the\r\nspectrum at regular intervals. Obviously the star sending such light\r\nis alternately approaching and receding, and the inference that it is\r\nrevolving about a companion is unavoidable. From this extraordinary test\r\nthe orbital distance, relative mass, and actual speed of revolution of\r\nthe absolutely invisible body may be determined. Thus the spectroscope,\r\nwhich deals only with light, makes paradoxical excursions into the\r\nrealm of the invisible. What secrets may the stars hope to conceal when\r\nquestioned by an instrument of such necromantic power?\r\n\r\nBut the spectroscope is not alone in this audacious assault upon the\r\nstrongholds of nature. It has a worthy companion and assistant in\r\nthe photographic film, whose efficient aid has been invoked by the\r\nastronomer even more recently. Pioneer work in celestial photography\r\nwas, indeed, done by Arago in France and by the elder Draper in America\r\nin 1839, but the results then achieved were only tentative, and it was\r\nnot till forty years later that the method assumed really important\r\nproportions. In 1880, Dr. Henry Draper, at Hastings-on-the-Hudson, made\r\nthe first successful photograph of a nebula. Soon after, Dr. David\r\nGill, at the Cape observatory, made fine photographs of a comet, and the\r\nflecks of starlight on his plates first suggested the possibilities of\r\nthis method in charting the heavens.\r\n\r\nSince then star-charting with the film has come virtually to supersede\r\nthe old method. A concerted effort is being made by astronomers in\r\nvarious parts of the world to make a complete chart of the heavens, and\r\nbefore the close of our century this work will be accomplished, some\r\nfifty or sixty millions of visible stars being placed on record with a\r\ndegree of accuracy hitherto unapproachable. Moreover, other millions of\r\nstars are brought to light by the negative, which are too distant or\r\ndim to be visible with any telescopic powers yet attained--a fact\r\nwhich wholly discredits all previous inferences as to the limits of\r\nour sidereal system. Hence, notwithstanding the wonderful instrumental\r\nadvances of the nineteenth century, knowledge of the exact form and\r\nextent of our universe seems more unattainable than it seemed a century\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Structure of Nebulae\r\n\r\nYet the new instruments, while leaving so much untold, have revealed\r\nsome vastly important secrets of cosmic structure. In particular, they\r\nhave set at rest the long-standing doubts as to the real structure and\r\nposition of the mysterious nebulae--those lazy masses, only two or\r\nthree of them visible to the unaided eye, which the telescope reveals\r\nin almost limitless abundance, scattered everywhere among the stars,\r\nbut grouped in particular about the poles of the stellar stream or disk\r\nwhich we call the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nHerschel's later view, which held that some at least of the nebulae are\r\ncomposed of a \"shining fluid,\" in process of condensation to form stars,\r\nwas generally accepted for almost half a century. But in 1844, when\r\nLord Rosse's great six-foot reflector--the largest telescope ever yet\r\nconstructed--was turned on the nebulae, it made this hypothesis seem\r\nvery doubtful. Just as Galileo's first lens had resolved the Milky Way\r\ninto stars, just as Herschel had resolved nebulae that resisted all\r\ninstruments but his own, so Lord Rosse's even greater reflector resolved\r\nothers that would not yield to Herschel's largest mirror. It seemed\r\na fair inference that with sufficient power, perhaps some day to be\r\nattained, all nebulae would yield, hence that all are in reality what\r\nHerschel had at first thought them--vastly distant \"island universes,\"\r\ncomposed of aggregations of stars, comparable to our own galactic\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nBut the inference was wrong; for when the spectroscope was first applied\r\nto a nebula in 1864, by Dr. Huggins, it clearly showed the spectrum not\r\nof discrete stars, but of a great mass of glowing gases, hydrogen among\r\nothers. More extended studies showed, it is true, that some nebulae give\r\nthe continuous spectrum of solids or liquids, but the different types\r\nintermingle and grade into one another. Also, the closest affinity\r\nis shown between nebulae and stars. Some nebulae are found to contain\r\nstars, singly or in groups, in their actual midst; certain condensed\r\n\"planetary\" nebulae are scarcely to be distinguished from stars of the\r\ngaseous type; and recently the photographic film has shown the presence\r\nof nebulous matter about stars that to telescopic vision differ in no\r\nrespect from the generality of their fellows in the galaxy. The familiar\r\nstars of the Pleiades cluster, for example, appear on the negative\r\nimmersed in a hazy blur of light. All in all, the accumulated\r\nimpressions of the photographic film reveal a prodigality of nebulous\r\nmatter in the stellar system not hitherto even conjectured.\r\n\r\nAnd so, of course, all question of \"island universes\" vanishes, and the\r\nnebulae are relegated to their true position as component parts of the\r\none stellar system--the one universe--that is open to present human\r\ninspection. And these vast clouds of world-stuff have been found by\r\nProfessor Keeler, of the Lick observatory, to be floating through space\r\nat the starlike speed of from ten to thirty-eight miles per second.\r\n\r\nThe linking of nebulae with stars, so clearly evidenced by all these\r\nmodern observations, is, after all, only the scientific corroboration of\r\nwhat the elder Herschel's later theories affirmed. But the nebulae have\r\nother affinities not until recently suspected; for the spectra of some\r\nof them are practically identical with the spectra of certain comets.\r\nThe conclusion seems warranted that comets are in point of fact minor\r\nnebulae that are drawn into our system; or, putting it otherwise, that\r\nthe telescopic nebulae are simply gigantic distant comets.\r\n\r\n\r\nLockyer's Meteoric Hypothesis\r\n\r\nFollowing up the surprising clews thus suggested, Sir Norman Lockyer,\r\nof London, has in recent years elaborated what is perhaps the most\r\ncomprehensive cosmogonic guess that has ever been attempted. His theory,\r\nknown as the \"meteoric hypothesis,\" probably bears the same relation\r\nto the speculative thought of our time that the nebular hypothesis of\r\nLaplace bore to that of the eighteenth century. Outlined in a few words,\r\nit is an attempt to explain all the major phenomena of the universe\r\nas due, directly or indirectly, to the gravitational impact of such\r\nmeteoric particles, or specks of cosmic dust, as comets are composed\r\nof. Nebulae are vast cometary clouds, with particles more or less widely\r\nseparated, giving off gases through meteoric collisions, internal or\r\nexternal, and perhaps glowing also with electrical or phosphorescent\r\nlight. Gravity eventually brings the nebular particles into closer\r\naggregations, and increased collisions finally vaporize the entire mass,\r\nforming planetary nebulae and gaseous stars. Continued condensation\r\nmay make the stellar mass hotter and more luminous for a time, but\r\neventually leads to its liquefaction, and ultimate consolidation--the\r\naforetime nebulae becoming in the end a dark or planetary star.\r\n\r\nThe exact correlation which Lockyer attempts to point out between\r\nsuccessive stages of meteoric condensation and the various types of\r\nobserved stellar bodies does not meet with unanimous acceptance. Mr.\r\nRanyard, for example, suggests that the visible nebulae may not be\r\nnascent stars, but emanations from stars, and that the true pre-stellar\r\nnebulae are invisible until condensed to stellar proportions. But such\r\ndetails aside, the broad general hypothesis that all the bodies of the\r\nuniverse are, so to speak, of a single species--that nebulae (including\r\ncomets), stars of all types, and planets, are but varying stages in the\r\nlife history of a single race or type of cosmic organisms--is accepted\r\nby the dominant thought of our time as having the highest warrant of\r\nscientific probability.\r\n\r\nAll this, clearly, is but an amplification of that nebular hypothesis\r\nwhich, long before the spectroscope gave us warrant to accurately judge\r\nour sidereal neighbors, had boldly imagined the development of stars out\r\nof nebulae and of planets out of stars. But Lockyer's hypothesis does\r\nnot stop with this. Having traced the developmental process from the\r\nnebular to the dark star, it sees no cause to abandon this dark star to\r\nits fate by assuming, as the original speculation assumed, that this is\r\na culminating and final stage of cosmic existence. For the dark star,\r\nthough its molecular activities have come to relative stability and\r\nimpotence, still retains the enormous potentialities of molar motion;\r\nand clearly, where motion is, stasis is not. Sooner or later, in its\r\nceaseless flight through space, the dark star must collide with some\r\nother stellar body, as Dr. Croll imagines of the dark bodies which his\r\n\"pre-nebular theory\" postulates. Such collision may be long delayed; the\r\ndark star may be drawn in comet-like circuit about thousands of other\r\nstellar masses, and be hurtled on thousands of diverse parabolic or\r\nelliptical orbits, before it chances to collide--but that matters not:\r\n\"billions are the units in the arithmetic of eternity,\" and sooner\r\nor later, we can hardly doubt, a collision must occur. Then without\r\nquestion the mutual impact must shatter both colliding bodies into\r\nvapor, or vapor combined with meteoric fragments; in short, into a\r\nveritable nebula, the matrix of future worlds. Thus the dark star, which\r\nis the last term of one series of cosmic changes, becomes the first term\r\nof another series--at once a post-nebular and a pre-nebular condition;\r\nand the nebular hypothesis, thus amplified, ceases to be a mere linear\r\nscale, and is rounded out to connote an unending series of cosmic\r\ncycles, more nearly satisfying the imagination.\r\n\r\nIn this extended view, nebulae and luminous stars are but the infantile\r\nand adolescent stages of the life history of the cosmic individual; the\r\ndark star, its adult stage, or time of true virility. Or we may think of\r\nthe shrunken dark star as the germ-cell, the pollen-grain, of the cosmic\r\norganism. Reduced in size, as becomes a germ-cell, to a mere fraction\r\nof the nebular body from which it sprang, it yet retains within\r\nits seemingly non-vital body all the potentialities of the original\r\norganism, and requires only to blend with a fellow-cell to bring a new\r\ngeneration into being. Thus may the cosmic race, whose aggregate census\r\nmakes up the stellar universe, be perpetuated--individual solar systems,\r\nsuch as ours, being born, and growing old, and dying to live again in\r\ntheir descendants, while the universe as a whole maintains its unified\r\nintegrity throughout all these internal mutations--passing on, it may\r\nbe, by infinitesimal stages, to a culmination hopelessly beyond human\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE NEW SCIENCE OF PALEONTOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM SMITH AND FOSSIL SHELLS\r\n\r\nEver since Leonardo da Vinci first recognized the true character of\r\nfossils, there had been here and there a man who realized that the\r\nearth's rocky crust is one gigantic mausoleum. Here and there a\r\ndilettante had filled his cabinets with relics from this monster crypt;\r\nhere and there a philosopher had pondered over them--questioning whether\r\nperchance they had once been alive, or whether they were not mere\r\nabortive souvenirs of that time when the fertile matrix of the earth was\r\nsupposed to have\r\n\r\n              \"teemed at a birth\r\n     Innumerous living creatures, perfect forms,\r\n     Limbed and full grown.\"\r\n\r\nSome few of these philosophers--as Robert Hooke and Steno in the\r\nseventeenth century, and Moro, Leibnitz, Buffon, Whitehurst, Werner,\r\nHutton, and others in the eighteenth--had vaguely conceived the\r\nimportance of fossils as records of the earth's ancient history, but the\r\nwisest of them no more suspected the full import of the story written\r\nin the rocks than the average stroller in a modern museum suspects the\r\nmeaning of the hieroglyphs on the case of a mummy.\r\n\r\nIt was not that the rudiments of this story are so very hard to\r\ndecipher--though in truth they are hard enough--but rather that the\r\nmen who made the attempt had all along viewed the subject through an\r\natmosphere of preconception, which gave a distorted image. Before this\r\nimage could be corrected it was necessary that a man should appear who\r\ncould see without prejudice, and apply sound common-sense to what he\r\nsaw. And such a man did appear towards the close of the century, in the\r\nperson of William Smith, the English surveyor. He was a self-taught man,\r\nand perhaps the more independent for that, and he had the gift, besides\r\nhis sharp eyes and receptive mind, of a most tenacious memory. By\r\nexercising these faculties, rare as they are homely, he led the way to\r\na science which was destined, in its later developments, to shake the\r\nstructure of established thought to its foundations.\r\n\r\nLittle enough did William Smith suspect, however, that any such dire\r\nconsequences were to come of his act when he first began noticing the\r\nfossil shells that here and there are to be found in the stratified\r\nrocks and soils of the regions over which his surveyor's duties led him.\r\nNor, indeed, was there anything of such apparent revolutionary character\r\nin the facts which he unearthed; yet in their implications these facts\r\nwere the most disconcerting of any that had been revealed since the days\r\nof Copernicus and Galileo. In its bald essence, Smith's discovery was\r\nsimply this: that the fossils in the rocks, instead of being scattered\r\nhaphazard, are arranged in regular systems, so that any given stratum\r\nof rock is labelled by its fossil population; and that the order of\r\nsuccession of such groups of fossils is always the same in any vertical\r\nseries of strata in which they occur. That is to say, if fossil A\r\nunderlies fossil B in any given region, it never overlies it in any\r\nother series; though a kind of fossils found in one set of strata may\r\nbe quite omitted in another. Moreover, a fossil once having disappeared\r\nnever reappears in any later stratum.\r\n\r\nFrom these novel facts Smith drew the commonsense inference that the\r\nearth had had successive populations of creatures, each of which in\r\nits turn had become extinct. He partially verified this inference by\r\ncomparing the fossil shells with existing species of similar orders,\r\nand found that such as occur in older strata of the rocks had no\r\ncounterparts among living species. But, on the whole, being eminently\r\na practical man, Smith troubled himself but little about the inferences\r\nthat might be drawn from his facts. He was chiefly concerned in using\r\nthe key he had discovered as an aid to the construction of the first\r\ngeological map of England ever attempted, and he left to others the\r\nuntangling of any snarls of thought that might seem to arise from his\r\ndiscovery of the succession of varying forms of life on the globe.\r\n\r\nHe disseminated his views far and wide, however, in the course of his\r\njourneyings--quite disregarding the fact that peripatetics went out of\r\nfashion when the printing-press came in--and by the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century he had begun to have a following among the geologists\r\nof England. It must not for a moment be supposed, however, that his\r\ncontention regarding the succession of strata met with immediate or\r\ngeneral acceptance. On the contrary, it was most bitterly antagonized.\r\nFor a long generation after the discovery was made, the generality of\r\nmen, prone as always to strain at gnats and swallow camels, preferred to\r\nbelieve that the fossils, instead of being deposited in successive ages,\r\nhad been swept all at once into their present positions by the current\r\nof a mighty flood--and that flood, needless to say, the Noachian deluge.\r\nJust how the numberless successive strata could have been laid down\r\nin orderly sequence to the depth of several miles in one such fell\r\ncataclysm was indeed puzzling, especially after it came to be admitted\r\nthat the heaviest fossils were not found always at the bottom; but to\r\ndoubt that this had been done in some way was rank heresy in the early\r\ndays of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUVIER AND FOSSIL VERTEBRATES\r\n\r\nBut once discovered, William Smith's unique facts as to the succession\r\nof forms in the rocks would not down. There was one most vital point,\r\nhowever, regarding which the inferences that seem to follow from\r\nthese facts needed verification--the question, namely, whether the\r\ndisappearance of a fauna from the register in the rocks really implies\r\nthe extinction of that fauna. Everything really depended upon the answer\r\nto that question, and none but an accomplished naturalist could answer\r\nit with authority. Fortunately, the most authoritative naturalist of the\r\ntime, George Cuvier, took the question in hand--not, indeed, with the\r\nidea of verifying any suggestion of Smith's, but in the course of his\r\nown original studies--at the very beginning of the century, when Smith's\r\nviews were attracting general attention.\r\n\r\nCuvier and Smith were exact contemporaries, both men having been born in\r\n1769, that \"fertile year\" which gave the world also Chateaubriand, Von\r\nHumboldt, Wellington, and Napoleon. But the French naturalist was of\r\nvery different antecedents from the English surveyor. He was brilliantly\r\neducated, had early gained recognition as a scientist, and while yet a\r\nyoung man had come to be known as the foremost comparative anatomist of\r\nhis time. It was the anatomical studies that led him into the realm of\r\nfossils. Some bones dug out of the rocks by workmen in a quarry were\r\nbrought to his notice, and at once his trained eye told him that they\r\nwere different from anything he had seen before. Hitherto such bones,\r\nwhen not entirely ignored, had been for the most part ascribed to\r\ngiants of former days, or even to fallen angels. Cuvier soon showed\r\nthat neither giants nor angels were in question, but elephants of an\r\nunrecognized species. Continuing his studies, particularly with material\r\ngathered from gypsum beds near Paris, he had accumulated, by the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, bones of about twenty-five species\r\nof animals that he believed to be different from any now living on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe fame of these studies went abroad, and presently fossil bones poured\r\nin from all sides, and Cuvier's conviction that extinct forms of animals\r\nare represented among the fossils was sustained by the evidence of many\r\nstrange and anomalous forms, some of them of gigantic size. In 1816\r\nthe famous Ossements Fossiles, describing these novel objects, was\r\npublished, and vertebrate paleontology became a science. Among\r\nother things of great popular interest the book contained the first\r\nauthoritative description of the hairy elephant, named by Cuvier the\r\nmammoth, the remains of which bad been found embedded in a mass of\r\nice in Siberia in 1802, so wonderfully preserved that the dogs of the\r\nTungusian fishermen actually ate its flesh. Bones of the same species\r\nhad been found in Siberia several years before by the naturalist Pallas,\r\nwho had also found the carcass of a rhinoceros there, frozen in a\r\nmud-bank; but no one then suspected that these were members of an\r\nextinct population--they were supposed to be merely transported relics\r\nof the flood.\r\n\r\nCuvier, on the other hand, asserted that these and the other creatures\r\nhe described had lived and died in the region where their remains were\r\nfound, and that most of them have no living representatives upon the\r\nglobe. This, to be sure, was nothing more than William Smith had tried\r\nall along to establish regarding lower forms of life; but flesh and\r\nblood monsters appeal to the imagination in a way quite beyond the power\r\nof mere shells; so the announcement of Cuvier's discoveries aroused the\r\ninterest of the entire world, and the Ossements Fossiles was accorded a\r\npopular reception seldom given a work of technical science--a reception\r\nin which the enthusiastic approval of progressive geologists was mingled\r\nwith the bitter protests of the conservatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Naturalists certainly have neither explored all the continents,\" said\r\nCuvier, \"nor do they as yet even know all the quadrupeds of those parts\r\nwhich have been explored. New species of this class are discovered from\r\ntime to time; and those who have not examined with attention all the\r\ncircumstances belonging to these discoveries may allege also that the\r\nunknown quadrupeds, whose fossil bones have been found in the strata\r\nof the earth, have hitherto remained concealed in some islands not yet\r\ndiscovered by navigators, or in some of the vast deserts which occupy\r\nthe middle of Africa, Asia, the two Americas, and New Holland.\r\n\r\n\"But if we carefully attend to the kind of quadrupeds that have been\r\nrecently discovered, and to the circumstances of their discovery, we\r\nshall easily perceive that there is very little chance indeed of our\r\never finding alive those which have only been seen in a fossil state.\r\n\r\n\"Islands of moderate size, and at a considerable distance from the large\r\ncontinents, have very few quadrupeds. These must have been carried\r\nto them from other countries. Cook and Bougainville found no other\r\nquadrupeds besides hogs and dogs in the South Sea Islands; and the\r\nlargest quadruped of the West India Islands, when first discovered, was\r\nthe agouti, a species of the cavy, an animal apparently between the rat\r\nand the rabbit.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that the great continents, as Asia, Africa, the two\r\nAmericas, and New Holland, have large quadrupeds, and, generally\r\nspeaking, contain species common to each; insomuch, that upon\r\ndiscovering countries which are isolated from the rest of the world,\r\nthe animals they contain of the class of quadruped were found entirely\r\ndifferent from those which existed in other countries. Thus, when the\r\nSpaniards first penetrated into South America, they did not find it to\r\ncontain a single quadruped exactly the same with those of Europe, Asia,\r\nand Africa. The puma, the jaguar, the tapir, the capybara, the llama,\r\nor glama, and vicuna, and the whole tribe of sapajous, were to them\r\nentirely new animals, of which they had not the smallest idea....\r\n\r\n\"If there still remained any great continent to be discovered, we\r\nmight perhaps expect to be made acquainted with new species of large\r\nquadrupeds, among which some might be found more or less similar to\r\nthose of which we find the exuviae in the bowels of the earth. But it\r\nis merely sufficient to glance the eye over the maps of the world and\r\nobserve the innumerable directions in which navigators have traversed\r\nthe ocean, in order to be satisfied that there does not remain any large\r\nland to be discovered, unless it may be situated towards the Antarctic\r\nPole, where eternal ice necessarily forbids the existence of animal\r\nlife.\"(1)\r\n\r\nCuvier then points out that the ancients were well acquainted with\r\npractically all the animals on the continents of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica now known to scientists. He finds little grounds, therefore, for\r\nbelief in the theory that at one time there were monstrous animals on\r\nthe earth which it was necessary to destroy in order that the present\r\nfauna and men might flourish. After reviewing these theories and beliefs\r\nin detail, he takes up his Inquiry Respecting the Fabulous Animals\r\nof the Ancients. \"It is easy,\" he says, \"to reply to the foregoing\r\nobjections, by examining the descriptions that are left us by the\r\nancients of those unknown animals, and by inquiring into their origins.\r\nNow that the greater number of these animals have an origin, the\r\ndescriptions given of them bear the most unequivocal marks; as in almost\r\nall of them we see merely the different parts of known animals united by\r\nan unbridled imagination, and in contradiction to every established law\r\nof nature.\"(2)\r\n\r\nHaving shown how the fabulous monsters of ancient times and of foreign\r\nnations, such as the Chinese, were simply products of the imagination,\r\nhaving no prototypes in nature, Cuvier takes up the consideration of the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing the fossil bones of quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion to revert to this part of Cuvier's paper in\r\nanother connection. Here it suffices to pass at once to the final\r\nconclusion that the fossil bones in question are the remains of an\r\nextinct fauna, the like of which has no present-day representation on\r\nthe earth. Whatever its implications, this conclusion now seemed to\r\nCuvier to be fully established.\r\n\r\nIn England the interest thus aroused was sent to fever-heat in 1821 by\r\nthe discovery of abundant beds of fossil bones in the stalagmite-covered\r\nfloor of a cave at Kirkdale, Yorkshire which went to show that England,\r\ntoo, had once had her share of gigantic beasts. Dr. Buckland, the\r\nincumbent of the chair of geology at Oxford, and the most authoritative\r\nEnglish geologist of his day, took these finds in hand and showed that\r\nthe bones belonged to a number of species, including such alien forms as\r\nelephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotami, and hyenas. He maintained that all\r\nof these creatures had actually lived in Britain, and that the caves in\r\nwhich their bones were found had been the dens of hyenas.\r\n\r\nThe claim was hotly disputed, as a matter of course. As late as 1827\r\nbooks were published denouncing Buckland, doctor of divinity though he\r\nwas, as one who had joined in an \"unhallowed cause,\" and reiterating the\r\nold cry that the fossils were only remains of tropical species washed\r\nthither by the deluge. That they were found in solid rocks or in caves\r\noffered no difficulty, at least not to the fertile imagination of\r\nGranville Penn, the leader of the conservatives, who clung to the old\r\nidea of Woodward and Cattcut that the deluge had dissolved the entire\r\ncrust of the earth to a paste, into which the relics now called fossils\r\nhad settled. The caves, said Mr. Penn, are merely the result of gases\r\ngiven off by the carcasses during decomposition--great air-bubbles, so\r\nto speak, in the pasty mass, becoming caverns when the waters receded\r\nand the paste hardened to rocky consistency.\r\n\r\nBut these and such-like fanciful views were doomed even in the day of\r\ntheir utterance. Already in 1823 other gigantic creatures, christened\r\nichthyosaurus and plesiosaurus by Conybeare, had been found in deeper\r\nstrata of British rocks; and these, as well as other monsters whose\r\nremains were unearthed in various parts of the world, bore such strange\r\nforms that even the most sceptical could scarcely hope to find their\r\ncounterparts among living creatures. Cuvier's contention that all the\r\nlarger vertebrates of the existing age are known to naturalists was\r\nborne out by recent explorations, and there seemed no refuge from the\r\nconclusion that the fossil records tell of populations actually extinct.\r\nBut if this were admitted, then Smith's view that there have been\r\nsuccessive rotations of population could no longer be denied. Nor could\r\nit be in doubt that the successive faunas, whose individual remains have\r\nbeen preserved in myriads, representing extinct species by thousands\r\nand tens of thousands, must have required vast periods of time for the\r\nproduction and growth of their countless generations.\r\n\r\nAs these facts came to be generally known, and as it came to be\r\nunderstood in addition that the very matrix of the rock in which fossils\r\nare imbedded is in many cases one gigantic fossil, composed of the\r\nremains of microscopic forms of life, common-sense, which, after all,\r\nis the final tribunal, came to the aid of belabored science. It was\r\nconceded that the only tenable interpretation of the record in the rocks\r\nis that numerous populations of creatures, distinct from one another and\r\nfrom present forms, have risen and passed away; and that the geologic\r\nages in which these creatures lived were of inconceivable length. The\r\nrank and file came thus, with the aid of fossil records, to realize\r\nthe import of an idea which James Hutton, and here and there another\r\nthinker, had conceived with the swift intuition of genius long\r\nbefore the science of paleontology came into existence. The Huttonian\r\nproposition that time is long had been abundantly established, and by\r\nabout the close of the first third of the last century geologists had\r\nbegun to speak of \"ages\" and \"untold aeons of time\" with a familiarity\r\nwhich their predecessors had reserved for days and decades.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES LYELL COMBATS CATASTROPHISM\r\n\r\nAnd now a new question pressed for solution. If the earth has been\r\ninhabited by successive populations of beings now extinct, how have\r\nall these creatures been destroyed? That question, however, seemed to\r\npresent no difficulties. It was answered out of hand by the application\r\nof an old idea. All down the centuries, whatever their varying phases of\r\ncosmogonic thought, there had been ever present the idea that past times\r\nwere not as recent times; that in remote epochs the earth had been the\r\nscene of awful catastrophes that have no parallel in \"these degenerate\r\ndays.\" Naturally enough, this thought, embalmed in every cosmogonic\r\nspeculation of whatever origin, was appealed to in explanation of the\r\ndestruction of these hitherto unimagined hosts, which now, thanks to\r\nscience, rose from their abysmal slumber as incontestable, but also as\r\nsilent and as thought-provocative, as Sphinx or pyramid. These ancient\r\nhosts, it was said, have been exterminated at intervals of odd millions\r\nof years by the recurrence of catastrophes of which the Mosaic deluge is\r\nthe latest, but perhaps not the last.\r\n\r\nThis explanation had fullest warrant of scientific authority. Cuvier had\r\nprefaced his classical work with a speculative disquisition whose\r\nvery title (Discours sur les Revolutions du Globe) is ominous of\r\ncatastrophism, and whose text fully sustains the augury. And Buckland,\r\nCuvier's foremost follower across the Channel, had gone even beyond\r\nthe master, naming the work in which he described the Kirkdale fossils,\r\nReliquiae Diluvianae, or Proofs of a Universal Deluge.\r\n\r\nBoth these authorities supposed the creatures whose remains they studied\r\nto have perished suddenly in the mighty flood whose awful current, as\r\nthey supposed, gouged out the modern valleys and hurled great blocks of\r\ngranite broadcast over the land. And they invoked similar floods for the\r\nextermination of previous populations.\r\n\r\nIt is true these scientific citations had met with only qualified\r\napproval at the time of their utterance, because then the conservative\r\nmajority of mankind did not concede that there had been a plurality of\r\npopulations or revolutions; but now that the belief in past geologic\r\nages had ceased to be a heresy, the recurring catastrophes of the great\r\npaleontologists were accepted with acclaim. For the moment science and\r\ntradition were at one, and there was a truce to controversy, except\r\nindeed in those outlying skirmish-lines of thought whither news from\r\nheadquarters does not permeate till it has become ancient history at its\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nThe truce, however, was not for long. Hardly had contemporary\r\nthought begun to adjust itself to the conception of past ages of\r\nincomprehensible extent, each terminated by a catastrophe of the\r\nNoachian type, when a man appeared who made the utterly bewildering\r\nassertion that the geological record, instead of proving numerous\r\ncatastrophic revolutions in the earth's past history, gives no warrant\r\nto the pretensions of any universal catastrophe whatever, near or\r\nremote.\r\n\r\nThis iconoclast was Charles Lyell, the Scotchman, who was soon to be\r\nfamous as the greatest geologist of his time. As a young man he had\r\nbecome imbued with the force of the Huttonian proposition, that present\r\ncauses are one with those that produced the past changes of the\r\nglobe, and he carried that idea to what he conceived to be its logical\r\nconclusion. To his mind this excluded the thought of catastrophic\r\nchanges in either inorganic or organic worlds.\r\n\r\nBut to deny catastrophism was to suggest a revolution in current\r\nthought. Needless to say, such revolution could not be effected without\r\na long contest. For a score of years the matter was argued pro and con.,\r\noften with most unscientific ardor. A mere outline of the controversy\r\nwould fill a volume; yet the essential facts with which Lyell at last\r\nestablished his proposition, in its bearings on the organic world, may\r\nbe epitomized in a few words. The evidence which seems to tell of past\r\nrevolutions is the apparently sudden change of fossils from one stratum\r\nto another of the rocks. But Lyell showed that this change is not always\r\ncomplete. Some species live on from one alleged epoch into the next. By\r\nno means all the contemporaries of the mammoth are extinct, and numerous\r\nmarine forms vastly more ancient still have living representatives.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the blanks between strata in any particular vertical series\r\nare amply filled in with records in the form of thick strata in some\r\ngeographically distant series. For example, in some regions Silurian\r\nrocks are directly overlaid by the coal measures; but elsewhere this\r\nsudden break is filled in with the Devonian rocks that tell of a great\r\n\"age of fishes.\" So commonly are breaks in the strata in one region\r\nfilled up in another that we are forced to conclude that the\r\nrecord shown by any single vertical series is of but local\r\nsignificance--telling, perhaps, of a time when that particular sea-bed\r\noscillated above the water-line, and so ceased to receive sediment until\r\nsome future age when it had oscillated back again. But if this be\r\nthe real significance of the seemingly sudden change from stratum to\r\nstratum, then the whole case for catastrophism is hopelessly lost; for\r\nsuch breaks in the strata furnish the only suggestion geology can offer\r\nof sudden and catastrophic changes of wide extent.\r\n\r\nLet us see how Lyell elaborates these ideas, particularly with reference\r\nto the rotation of species.(2)\r\n\r\n\"I have deduced as a corollary,\" he says, \"that the species existing at\r\nany particular period must, in the course of ages, become extinct, one\r\nafter the other. 'They must die out,' to borrow an emphatic expression\r\nfrom Buffon, 'because Time fights against them.' If the views which I\r\nhave taken are just, there will be no difficulty in explaining why\r\nthe habitations of so many species are now restrained within exceeding\r\nnarrow limits. Every local revolution tends to circumscribe the range\r\nof some species, while it enlarges that of others; and if we are led\r\nto infer that new species originate in one spot only, each must require\r\ntime to diffuse itself over a wide area. It will follow, therefore, from\r\nthe adoption of our hypothesis that the recent origin of some species\r\nand the high antiquity of others are equally consistent with the general\r\nfact of their limited distribution, some being local because they have\r\nnot existed long enough to admit of their wide dissemination; others,\r\nbecause circumstances in the animate or inanimate world have occurred to\r\nrestrict the range within which they may once have obtained....\r\n\r\n\"If the reader should infer, from the facts laid before him, that the\r\nsuccessive extinction of animals and plants may be part of the constant\r\nand regular course of nature, he will naturally inquire whether there\r\nare any means provided for the repair of these losses? Is it possible as\r\na part of the economy of our system that the habitable globe should to a\r\ncertain extent become depopulated, both in the ocean and on the land, or\r\nthat the variety of species should diminish until some new era arrives\r\nwhen a new and extraordinary effort of creative energy is to be\r\ndisplayed? Or is it possible that new species can be called into being\r\nfrom time to time, and yet that so astonishing a phenomenon can escape\r\nthe naturalist?\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, it is obviously more easy to prove that a species\r\nonce numerously represented in a given district has ceased to be\r\nthan that some other which did not pre-exist had made its\r\nappearance--assuming always, for reasons before stated, that single\r\nstocks only of each animal and plant are originally created, and that\r\nindividuals of new species did not suddenly start up in many different\r\nplaces at once.\r\n\r\n\"So imperfect has the science of natural history remained down to our\r\nown times that, within the memory of persons now living, the numbers\r\nof known animals and plants have doubled, or even quadrupled, in many\r\nclasses. New and often conspicuous species are annually discovered in\r\nparts of the old continent long inhabited by the most civilized nations.\r\nConscious, therefore, of the limited extent of our information, we\r\nalways infer, when such discoveries are made, that the beings in\r\nquestion bad previously eluded our research, or had at least existed\r\nelsewhere, and only migrated at a recent period into the territories\r\nwhere we now find them.\r\n\r\n\"What kind of proofs, therefore, could we reasonably expect to find of\r\nthe origin at a particular period of a new species?\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, it may be said in reply, that within the last two or three\r\ncenturies some forest tree or new quadruped might have been observed to\r\nappear suddenly in those parts of England or France which had been most\r\nthoroughly investigated--that naturalists might have been able to show\r\nthat no such being inhabited any other region of the globe, and that\r\nthere was no tradition of anything similar having been observed in the\r\ndistrict where it had made its appearance.\r\n\r\n\"Now, although this objection may seem plausible, yet its force will be\r\nfound to depend entirely on the rate of fluctuation which we suppose\r\nto prevail in the animal world, and on the proportions which such\r\nconspicuous subjects of the animal and vegetable kingdoms bear to those\r\nwhich are less known and escape our observation. There are perhaps\r\nmore than a million species of plants and animals, exclusive of the\r\nmicroscopic and infusory animalcules, now inhabiting the terraqueous\r\nglobe, so that if only one of these were to become extinct annually, and\r\none new one were to be every year called into being, much more than a\r\nmillion of years might be required to bring about a complete revolution\r\nof organic life.\r\n\r\n\"I am not hazarding at present any hypothesis as to the probable rate\r\nof change, but none will deny that when the annual birth and the annual\r\ndeath of one species on the globe is proposed as a mere speculation,\r\nthis, at least, is to imagine no slight degree of instability in the\r\nanimate creation. If we divide the surface of the earth into twenty\r\nregions of equal area, one of these might comprehend a space of land and\r\nwater about equal in dimensions to Europe, and might contain a twentieth\r\npart of the million of species which may be assumed to exist in the\r\nanimal kingdom. In this region one species only could, according to the\r\nrate of mortality before assumed, perish in twenty years, or only five\r\nout of fifty thousand in the course of a century. But as a considerable\r\nportion of the whole world belongs to the aquatic classes, with which\r\nwe have a very imperfect acquaintance, we must exclude them from our\r\nconsideration, and, if they constitute half of the entire number, then\r\none species only might be lost in forty years among the terrestrial\r\ntribes. Now the mammalia, whether terrestrial or aquatic, bear so small\r\na proportion to other classes of animals, forming less, perhaps, than\r\na thousandth part of a whole, that, if the longevity of species in the\r\ndifferent orders were equal, a vast period must elapse before it would\r\ncome to the turn of this conspicuous class to lose one of their number.\r\nIf one species only of the whole animal kingdom died out in forty years,\r\nno more than one mammifer might disappear in forty thousand years, in a\r\nregion of the dimensions of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy, therefore, to see that in a small portion of such an area,\r\nin countries, for example, of the size of England and France, periods\r\nof much greater duration must elapse before it would be possible\r\nto authenticate the first appearance of one of the larger plants or\r\nanimals, assuming the annual birth and death of one species to be the\r\nrate of vicissitude in the animal creation throughout the world.\"(3)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, said Lyell, it becomes clear that the numberless\r\nspecies that have been exterminated in the past have died out one by\r\none, just as individuals of a species die, not in vast shoals; if\r\nwhole populations have passed away, it has been not by instantaneous\r\nextermination, but by the elimination of a species now here, now there,\r\nmuch as one generation succeeds another in the life history of any\r\nsingle species. The causes which have brought about such gradual\r\nexterminations, and in the long lapse of ages have resulted in rotations\r\nof population, are the same natural causes that are still in operation.\r\nSpecies have died out in the past as they are dying out in the present,\r\nunder influence of changed surroundings, such as altered climate, or\r\nthe migration into their territory of more masterful species. Past and\r\npresent causes are one--natural law is changeless and eternal.\r\n\r\nSuch was the essence of the Huttonian doctrine, which Lyell adopted and\r\nextended, and with which his name will always be associated. Largely\r\nthrough his efforts, though of course not without the aid of many other\r\nworkers after a time, this idea--the doctrine of uniformitarianism, it\r\ncame to be called--became the accepted dogma of the geologic world not\r\nlong after the middle of the nineteenth century. The catastrophists,\r\nafter clinging madly to their phantom for a generation, at last\r\ncapitulated without terms: the old heresy became the new orthodoxy, and\r\nthe way was paved for a fresh controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF SPECIES\r\n\r\nThe fresh controversy followed quite as a matter of course. For the idea\r\nof catastrophism had not concerned the destruction of species merely,\r\nbut their introduction as well. If whole faunas had been extirpated\r\nsuddenly, new faunas had presumably been introduced with equal\r\nsuddenness by special creation; but if species die out gradually,\r\nthe introduction of new species may be presumed to be correspondingly\r\ngradual. Then may not the new species of a later geological epoch be\r\nthe modified lineal descendants of the extinct population of an earlier\r\nepoch?\r\n\r\nThe idea that such might be the case was not new. It had been suggested\r\nwhen fossils first began to attract conspicuous attention; and such\r\nsagacious thinkers as Buffon and Kant and Goethe and Erasmus Darwin\r\nhad been disposed to accept it in the closing days of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. Then, in 1809, it had been contended for by one of the early\r\nworkers in systematic paleontology--Jean Baptiste Lamarck, who\r\nhad studied the fossil shells about Paris while Cuvier studied the\r\nvertebrates, and who had been led by these studies to conclude that\r\nthere had been not merely a rotation but a progression of life on the\r\nglobe. He found the fossil shells--the fossils of invertebrates, as he\r\nhimself had christened them--in deeper strata than Cuvier's vertebrates;\r\nand he believed that there had been long ages when no higher forms than\r\nthese were in existence, and that in successive ages fishes, and then\r\nreptiles, had been the highest of animate creatures, before mammals,\r\nincluding man, appeared. Looking beyond the pale of his bare facts,\r\nas genius sometimes will, he had insisted that these progressive\r\npopulations had developed one from another, under influence of changed\r\nsurroundings, in unbroken series.\r\n\r\nOf course such a thought as this was hopelessly misplaced in a\r\ngeneration that doubted the existence of extinct species, and hardly\r\nless so in the generation that accepted catastrophism; but it had been\r\nkept alive by here and there an advocate like Geoffrey Saint-Hilaire,\r\nand now the banishment of catastrophism opened the way for its more\r\nrespectful consideration. Respectful consideration was given it by Lyell\r\nin each recurring edition of his Principles, but such consideration led\r\nto its unqualified rejection. In its place Lyell put forward a modified\r\nhypothesis of special creation. He assumed that from time to time,\r\nas the extirpation of a species had left room, so to speak, for a new\r\nspecies, such new species had been created de novo; and he supposed that\r\nsuch intermittent, spasmodic impulses of creation manifest themselves\r\nnowadays quite as frequently as at any time in the past. He did not say\r\nin so many words that no one need be surprised to-day were he to see a\r\nnew species of deer, for example, come up out of the ground before him,\r\n\"pawing to get free,\" like Milton's lion, but his theory implied as\r\nmuch. And that theory, let it be noted, was not the theory of Lyell\r\nalone, but of nearly all his associates in the geologic world. There is\r\nperhaps no other fact that will bring home to one so vividly the advance\r\nin thought of our own generation as the recollection that so crude, so\r\nalmost unthinkable a conception could have been the current doctrine of\r\nscience less than half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThis theory of special creation, moreover, excluded the current doctrine\r\nof uniformitarianism as night excludes day, though most thinkers of the\r\ntime did not seem to be aware of the incompatibility of the two ideas.\r\nIt may be doubted whether even Lyell himself fully realized it. If he\r\ndid, he saw no escape from the dilemma, for it seemed to him that\r\nthe record in the rocks clearly disproved the alternative Lamarckian\r\nhypothesis. And almost with one accord the paleontologists of the\r\ntime sustained the verdict. Owen, Agassiz, Falconer, Barrande, Pictet,\r\nForbes, repudiated the idea as unqualifiedly as their great predecessor\r\nCuvier had done in the earlier generation. Some of them did, indeed,\r\ncome to believe that there is evidence of a progressive development of\r\nlife in the successive ages, but no such graded series of fossils had\r\nbeen discovered as would give countenance to the idea that one species\r\nhad ever been transformed into another. And to nearly every one this\r\nobjection seemed insuperable.\r\n\r\nBut in 1859 appeared a book which, though not dealing primarily with\r\npaleontology, yet contained a chapter that revealed the geological\r\nrecord in an altogether new light. The book was Charles Darwin's Origin\r\nof Species, the chapter that wonderful citation of the \"Imperfections of\r\nthe Geological Record.\" In this epoch-making chapter Darwin shows what\r\nconditions must prevail in any given place in order that fossils shall\r\nbe formed, how unusual such conditions are, and how probable it is that\r\nfossils once imbedded in sediment of a sea-bed will be destroyed by\r\nmetamorphosis of the rocks, or by denudation when the strata are raised\r\nabove the water-level. Add to this the fact that only small territories\r\nof the earth have been explored geologically, he says, and it becomes\r\nclear that the paleontological record as we now possess it shows but\r\na mere fragment of the past history of organisms on the earth. It is\r\na history \"imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect. Of this\r\nhistory we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three\r\ncountries. Of this volume only here and there a short chapter has been\r\npreserved, and of each page only here and there a few lines.\" For a\r\npaleontologist to dogmatize from such a record would be as rash, he\r\nthinks, as \"for a naturalist to land for five minutes on a barren point\r\nof Australia and then discuss the number and range of its productions.\"\r\n\r\nThis citation of observations, which when once pointed out seemed almost\r\nself-evident, came as a revelation to the geological world. In the\r\nclarified view now possible old facts took on a new meaning. It was\r\nrecalled that Cuvier had been obliged to establish a new order for some\r\nof the first fossil creatures he examined, and that Buckland had noted\r\nthat the nondescript forms were intermediate in structure between\r\nallied existing orders. More recently such intermediate forms had been\r\ndiscovered over and over; so that, to name but one example, Owen had\r\nbeen able, with the aid of extinct species, to \"dissolve by gradations\r\nthe apparently wide interval between the pig and the camel.\" Owen,\r\nmoreover, had been led to speak repeatedly of the \"generalized forms\"\r\nof extinct animals, and Agassiz had called them \"synthetic or prophetic\r\ntypes,\" these terms clearly implying \"that such forms are in fact\r\nintermediate or connecting links.\" Darwin himself had shown some years\r\nbefore that the fossil animals of any continent are closely related to\r\nthe existing animals of that continent--edentates predominating, for\r\nexample, in South America, and marsupials in Australia. Many observers\r\nhad noted that recent strata everywhere show a fossil fauna more nearly\r\nlike the existing one than do more ancient strata; and that fossils from\r\nany two consecutive strata are far more closely related to each other\r\nthan are the fossils of two remote formations, the fauna of each\r\ngeological formation being, indeed, in a wide view, intermediate between\r\npreceding and succeeding faunas.\r\n\r\nSo suggestive were all these observations that Lyell, the admitted\r\nleader of the geological world, after reading Darwin's citations, felt\r\nable to drop his own crass explanation of the introduction of species\r\nand adopt the transmutation hypothesis, thus rounding out the doctrine\r\nof uniformitarianism to the full proportions in which Lamarck had\r\nconceived it half a century before. Not all paleontologists could follow\r\nhim at once, of course; the proof was not yet sufficiently demonstrative\r\nfor that; but all were shaken in the seeming security of their former\r\nposition, which is always a necessary stage in the progress of thought.\r\nAnd popular interest in the matter was raised to white heat in a\r\ntwinkling.\r\n\r\nSo, for the third time in this first century of its existence,\r\npaleontology was called upon to play a leading role in a controversy\r\nwhose interest extended far beyond the bounds of staid truth-seeking\r\nscience. And the controversy waged over the age of the earth had not\r\nbeen more bitter, that over catastrophism not more acrimonious, than\r\nthat which now raged over the question of the transmutation of species.\r\nThe question had implications far beyond the bounds of paleontology, of\r\ncourse. The main evidence yet presented had been drawn from quite other\r\nfields, but by common consent the record in the rocks might furnish a\r\ncrucial test of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. \"He who rejects\r\nthis view of the imperfections of the geological record,\" said Darwin,\r\n\"will rightly reject the whole theory.\"\r\n\r\nWith something more than mere scientific zeal, therefore,\r\npaleontologists turned anew to the records in the rocks, to inquire what\r\nevidence in proof or refutation might be found in unread pages of the\r\n\"great stone book.\" And, as might have been expected, many minds being\r\nthus prepared to receive new evidence, such evidence was not long\r\nwithheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOSSIL MAN\r\n\r\nIndeed, at the moment of Darwin's writing a new and very instructive\r\nchapter of the geologic record was being presented to the public--a\r\nchapter which for the first time brought man into the story. In 1859\r\nDr. Falconer, the distinguished British paleontologist, made a visit\r\nto Abbeville, in the valley of the Somme, incited by reports that for\r\na decade before bad been sent out from there by M. Boucher de Perthes.\r\nThese reports had to do with the alleged finding of flint implements,\r\nclearly the work of man, in undisturbed gravel-beds, in the midst of\r\nfossil remains of the mammoth and other extinct animals. What Falconer\r\nsaw there and what came of his visit may best be told in his own words:\r\n\r\n\"In September of 1856 I made the acquaintance of my distinguished friend\r\nM. Boucher de Perthes,\" wrote Dr. Falconer, \"on the introduction of M.\r\nDesnoyers at Paris, when he presented to me the earlier volume of his\r\nAntiquites celtiques, etc., with which I thus became acquainted for the\r\nfirst time. I was then fresh from the examination of the Indian fossil\r\nremains of the valley of the Jumna; and the antiquity of the human race\r\nbeing a subject of interest to both, we conversed freely about it,\r\neach from a different point of view. M. de Perthes invited me to visit\r\nAbbeville, in order to examine his antediluvian collection, fossil and\r\ngeological, gleaned from the valley of the Somme. This I was unable to\r\naccomplish then, but I reserved it for a future occasion.\r\n\r\n\"In October, 1856, having determined to proceed to Sicily, I arranged\r\nby correspondence with M. Boucher de Perthes to visit Abbeville on my\r\njourney through France. I was at the time in constant communication\r\nwith Mr. Prestwich about the proofs of the antiquity of the human race\r\nyielded by the Broxham Cave, in which he took a lively interest; and\r\nI engaged to communicate to him the opinions at which I should arrive,\r\nafter my examination of the Abbeville collection. M. de Perthes gave me\r\nthe freest access to his materials, with unreserved explanations of all\r\nthe facts of the case that had come under his observation; and having\r\nconsidered his Menchecourt Section, taken with such scrupulous care, and\r\nidentified the molars of elephas primigenius, which he had exhumed with\r\nhis own hands deep in that section, along with flint weapons, presenting\r\nthe same character as some of those found in the Broxham Cave, I arrived\r\nat the conviction that they were of contemporaneous age, although I\r\nwas not prepared to go along with M. de Perthes in all his inferences\r\nregarding the hieroglyphics and in an industrial interpretation of the\r\nvarious other objects which he had met with.\"(4)\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Falconer was much impressed by the collection of M. de\r\nPerthes is shown in a communication which he sent at once to his friend\r\nPrestwich:\r\n\r\n\"I have been richly rewarded,\" he exclaims. \"His collection of wrought\r\nflint implements, and of the objects of every description associated\r\nwith them, far exceeds everything I expected to have seen, especially\r\nfrom a single locality. He has made great additions, since the\r\npublication of his first volume, in the second, which I now have by\r\nme. He showed me flint hatchets which HE HAD DUG UP with his own hands,\r\nmixed INDISCRIMINATELY with molars of elephas primigenius. I examined\r\nand identified plates of the molars and the flint objects which were\r\ngot along with them. Abbeville is an out-of-the-way place, very little\r\nvisited; and the French savants who meet him in Paris laugh at Monsieur\r\nde Perthes and his researches. But after devoting the greater part of\r\na day to his vast collection, I am perfectly satisfied that there is\r\na great deal of fair presumptive evidence in favor of many of his\r\nspeculations regarding the remote antiquity of these industrial objects\r\nand their association with animals now extinct. M. Boucher's hotel\r\nis, from the ground floor to garret, a continued museum, filled with\r\npictures, mediaeval art, and Gaulish antiquities, including antediluvian\r\nflint-knives, fossil-bones, etc. If, during next summer, you should\r\nhappen to be paying a visit to France, let me strongly recommend you to\r\ncome to Abbeville. I am sure you would be richly rewarded.\"(5)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter aroused the interest of the English geologists, and in the\r\nspring of 1859 Prestwich and Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Evans made a\r\nvisit to Abbeville to see the specimens and examine at first hand the\r\nevidences as pointed out by Dr. Falconer. \"The evidence yielded by the\r\nvalley of the Somme,\" continues Falconer, in speaking of this visit,\r\n\"was gone into with the scrupulous care and severe and exhaustive\r\nanalysis which are characteristic of Mr. Prestwich's researches. The\r\nconclusions to which he was conducted were communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety on May 12, 1859, in his celebrated memoir, read on May 26th and\r\npublished in the Philosophical Transactions of 1860, which, in addition\r\nto researches made in the valley of the Somme, contained an account of\r\nsimilar phenomena presented by the valley of the Waveney, near Hoxne, in\r\nSuffolk. Mr. Evans communicated to the Society of Antiquaries a memoir\r\non the character and geological position of the 'Flint Implements in the\r\nDrift,' which appeared in the Archaeologia for 1860. The results arrived\r\nat by Mr. Prestwich were expressed as follows:\r\n\r\n\"First. That the flint implements are the result of design and the work\r\nof man.\r\n\r\n\"Second. That they are found in beds of gravel, sand, and clay, which\r\nhave never been artificially disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"Third. That they occur associated with the remains of land,\r\nfresh-water, and marine testacea, of species now living, and most of\r\nthem still common in the same neighborhood, and also with the remains of\r\nvarious mammalia--a few species now living, but more of extinct forms.\r\n\r\n\"Fourth. That the period at which their entombment took place was\r\nsubsequent to the bowlder-clay period, and to that extent post-glacial;\r\nand also that it was among the latest in geological time--one apparently\r\nanterior to the surface assuming its present form, so far as it regards\r\nsome of the minor features.\"(6)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese reports brought the subject of the very significant human fossils\r\nat Abbeville prominently before the public; whereas the publications of\r\nthe original discoverer, Boucher de Perthes, bearing date of 1847, had\r\nbeen altogether ignored. A new aspect was thus given to the current\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Falconer remarked, geology was now passing through the same\r\nordeal that astronomy passed in the age of Galileo. But the times were\r\nchanged since the day when the author of the Dialogues was humbled\r\nbefore the Congregation of the Index, and now no Index Librorum\r\nProhibitorum could avail to hide from eager human eyes such pages of\r\nthe geologic story as Nature herself had spared. Eager searchers were\r\nturning the leaves with renewed zeal everywhere, and with no small\r\nmeasure of success. In particular, interest attached just at this\r\ntime to a human skull which Dr. Fuhlrott had discovered in a cave at\r\nNeanderthal two or three years before--a cranium which has ever since\r\nbeen famous as the Neanderthal skull, the type specimen of what modern\r\nzoologists are disposed to regard as a distinct species of man, Homo\r\nneanderthalensis. Like others of the same type since discovered at Spy,\r\nit is singularly simian in character--low-arched, with receding forehead\r\nand enormous, protuberant eyebrows. When it was first exhibited to the\r\nscientists at Berlin by Dr. Fuhlrott, in 1857, its human character was\r\ndoubted by some of the witnesses; of that, however, there is no present\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThis interesting find served to recall with fresh significance some\r\nobservations that had been made in France and Belgium a long generation\r\nearlier, but whose bearings had hitherto been ignored. In 1826 MM.\r\nTournal and Christol had made independent discoveries of what they\r\nbelieved to be human fossils in the caves of the south of France; and\r\nin 1827 Dr. Schmerling had found in the cave of Engis, in Westphalia,\r\nfossil bones of even greater significance. Schmerling's explorations\r\nhad been made with the utmost care, and patience. At Engis he had\r\nfound human bones, including skulls, intermingled with those of extinct\r\nmammals of the mammoth period in a way that left no doubt in his mind\r\nthat all dated from the same geological epoch. He bad published a full\r\naccount of his discoveries in an elaborate monograph issued in 1833.\r\n\r\nBut at that time, as it chanced, human fossils were under a ban as\r\neffectual as any ever pronounced by canonical index, though of far\r\ndifferent origin. The oracular voice of Cuvier had declared against the\r\nauthenticity of all human fossils. Some of the bones brought him for\r\nexamination the great anatomist had pettishly pitched out of the window,\r\ndeclaring them fit only for a cemetery, and that had settled the matter\r\nfor a generation: the evidence gathered by lesser workers could avail\r\nnothing against the decision rendered at the Delphi of Science. But no\r\nban, scientific or canonical, can longer resist the germinative power of\r\na fact, and so now, after three decades of suppression, the truth which\r\nCuvier had buried beneath the weight of his ridicule burst its bonds,\r\nand fossil man stood revealed, if not as a flesh-and-blood, at least as\r\na skeletal entity.\r\n\r\nThe reception now accorded our prehistoric ancestor by the progressive\r\nportion of the scientific world amounted to an ovation; but the\r\nunscientific masses, on the other hand, notwithstanding their usual\r\nfondness for tracing remote genealogies, still gave the men of Engis\r\nand Neanderthal the cold shoulder. Nor were all of the geologists quite\r\nagreed that the contemporaneity of these human fossils with the animals\r\nwhose remains had been mingled with them had been fully established. The\r\nbare possibility that the bones of man and of animals that long preceded\r\nhim had been swept together into the eaves in successive ages, and\r\nin some mysterious way intermingled there, was clung to by the\r\nconservatives as a last refuge. But even this small measure of security\r\nwas soon to be denied them, for in 1865 two associated workers,\r\nM. Edouard Lartet and Mr. Henry Christy, in exploring the caves of\r\nDordogne, unearthed a bit of evidence against which no such objection\r\ncould be urged. This momentous exhibit was a bit of ivory, a fragment\r\nof the tusk of a mammoth, on which was scratched a rude but unmistakable\r\noutline portrait of the mammoth itself. If all the evidence as to man's\r\nantiquity before presented was suggestive merely, here at last was\r\ndemonstration; for the cave-dwelling man could not well have drawn the\r\npicture of the mammoth unless he had seen that animal, and to admit that\r\nman and the mammoth had been contemporaries was to concede the entire\r\ncase. So soon, therefore, as the full import of this most instructive\r\nwork of art came to be realized, scepticism as to man's antiquity was\r\nsilenced for all time to come.\r\n\r\nIn the generation that has elapsed since the first drawing of the\r\ncave-dweller artist was discovered, evidences of the wide-spread\r\nexistence of man in an early epoch have multiplied indefinitely, and\r\nto-day the paleontologist traces the history of our race back beyond the\r\niron and bronze ages, through a neolithic or polished-stone age, to\r\na paleolithic or rough-stone age, with confidence born of unequivocal\r\nknowledge. And he looks confidently to the future explorer of the\r\nearth's fossil records to extend the history back into vastly more\r\nremote epochs, for it is little doubted that paleolithic man, the most\r\nancient of our recognized progenitors, is a modern compared to those\r\ngenerations that represented the real childhood of our race.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOSSIL-BEDS OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nCoincidently with the discovery of these highly suggestive pages of the\r\ngeologic story, other still more instructive chapters were being brought\r\nto light in America. It was found that in the Rocky Mountain region, in\r\nstrata found in ancient lake beds, records of the tertiary period, or\r\nage of mammals, had been made and preserved with fulness not approached\r\nin any other region hitherto geologically explored. These records were\r\nmade known mainly by Professors Joseph Leidy, O. C. Marsh, and E. D.\r\nCope, working independently, and more recently by numerous younger\r\npaleontologists.\r\n\r\nThe profusion of vertebrate remains thus brought to light quite beggars\r\nall previous exhibits in point of mere numbers. Professor Marsh, for\r\nexample, who was first in the field, found three hundred new tertiary\r\nspecies between the years 1870 and 1876. Meanwhile, in cretaceous\r\nstrata, he unearthed remains of about two hundred birds with teeth, six\r\nhundred pterodactyls, or flying dragons, some with a spread of wings\r\nof twenty-five feet, and one thousand five hundred mosasaurs of the\r\nsea-serpent type, some of them sixty feet or more in length. In a single\r\nbed of Jurassic rock, not larger than a good-sized lecture-room, he\r\nfound the remains of one hundred and sixty individuals of mammals,\r\nrepresenting twenty species and nine genera; while beds of the same age\r\nhave yielded three hundred reptiles, varying from the size of a rabbit\r\nto sixty or eighty feet in length.\r\n\r\nBut the chief interest of these fossils from the West is not their\r\nnumber but their nature; for among them are numerous illustrations of\r\njust such intermediate types of organisms as must have existed in the\r\npast if the succession of life on the globe has been an unbroken lineal\r\nsuccession. Here are reptiles with bat-like wings, and others with\r\nbird-like pelves and legs adapted for bipedal locomotion. Here are\r\nbirds with teeth, and other reptilian characters. In short, what with\r\nreptilian birds and birdlike reptiles, the gap between modern reptiles\r\nand birds is quite bridged over. In a similar way, various diverse\r\nmammalian forms, as the tapir, the rhinoceros, and the horse, are linked\r\ntogether by fossil progenitors. And, most important of all, Professor\r\nMarsh has discovered a series of mammalian remains, occurring in\r\nsuccessive geological epochs, which are held to represent beyond cavil\r\nthe actual line of descent of the modern horse; tracing the lineage\r\nof our one-toed species back through two and three toed forms, to an\r\nancestor in the eocene or early tertiary that had four functional toes\r\nand the rudiment of a fifth. This discovery is too interesting and too\r\nimportant not to be detailed at length in the words of the discoverer.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarsh Describes the Fossil Horse\r\n\r\n\"It is a well-known fact,\" says Professor Marsh, \"that the Spanish\r\ndiscoverers of America discovered no horses on this continent, and that\r\nthe modern horse (Equus caballus, Linn.) was subsequently introduced\r\nfrom the Old World. It is, however, not so generally known that these\r\nanimals had formerly been abundant here, and that long before, in\r\ntertiary time, near relatives of the horse, and probably his ancestors,\r\nexisted in the far West in countless numbers and in a marvellous variety\r\nof forms. The remains of equine mammals, now known from the tertiary and\r\nquaternary deposits of this country, already represent more than double\r\nthe number of genera and species hitherto found in the strata of the\r\neastern hemisphere, and hence afford most important aid in tracing out\r\nthe genealogy of the horses still existing.\r\n\r\n\"The animals of this group which lived in America during the three\r\ndiversions of the tertiary period were especially numerous in the Rocky\r\nMountain regions, and their remains are well preserved in the old lake\r\nbasins which then covered so much of that country. The most ancient\r\nof these lakes--which extended over a considerable part of the present\r\nterritories of Wyoming and Utah--remained so long in eocene times that\r\nthe mud and sand, slowly deposited in it, accumulated to more than a\r\nmile in vertical thickness. In these deposits vast numbers of tropical\r\nanimals were entombed, and here the oldest equine remains occur,\r\nfour species of which have been described. These belong to the genus\r\nOrohippus (Marsh), and are all of a diminutive size, hardly bigger than\r\na fox. The skeletons of these animals resemble that of the horse in many\r\nrespects, much more indeed than any other existing species, but, instead\r\nof the single toe on each foot, so characteristic of all modern equines,\r\nthe various species of Orohippus had four toes before and three behind,\r\nall of which reached the ground. The skull, too, was proportionately\r\nshorter, and the orbit was not enclosed behind by a bridge of bone.\r\nThere were fifty four teeth in all, and the premolars were larger than\r\nthe molars. The crowns of these teeth were very short. The canine teeth\r\nwere developed in both sexes, and the incisors did not have the \"mark\"\r\nwhich indicates the age of the modern horse. The radius and ulna were\r\nseparate, and the latter was entire through the whole length. The tibia\r\nand fibula were distinct. In the forefoot all the digits except the\r\npollex, or first, were well developed. The third digit is the largest,\r\nand its close resemblance to that of the horse is clearly marked. The\r\nterminal phalanx, or coffin-bone, has a shallow median bone in front,\r\nas in many species of this group in the later tertiary. The fourth digit\r\nexceeds the second in size, and the second is much the shortest of all.\r\nIts metacarpal bone is considerably curved outward. In the hind-foot\r\nof this genus there are but three digits. The fourth metatarsal is much\r\nlarger than the second.\r\n\r\n\"The larger number of equine mammals now known from the tertiary\r\ndeposits of this country, and their regular distributions through the\r\nsubdivisions of this formation, afford a good opportunity to ascertain\r\nthe probable descent of the modern horse. The American representative of\r\nthe latter is the extinct Equus fraternus (Leidy), a species almost, if\r\nnot wholly, identical with the Old World Equus caballus (Linnaeus), to\r\nwhich our recent horse belongs. Huxley has traced successfully the later\r\ngenealogy of the horse through European extinct forms, but the line in\r\nAmerica was probably a more direct one, and the record is more complete.\r\nTaking, then, as the extreme of a series, Orohippus agilis (Marsh),\r\nfrom the eocene, and Equus fraternus (Leidy), from the quaternary,\r\nintermediate forms may be intercalated with considerable certainty\r\nfrom thirty or more well-marked species that lived in the intervening\r\nperiods. The natural line of descent would seem to be through the\r\nfollowing genera: Orohippus, of the eocene; Miohippus and Anchitherium,\r\nof the miocene; Anchippus, Hipparion, Protohippus, Phohippus, of the\r\npliocene; and Equus, quaternary and recent.\r\n\r\n\"The most marked changes undergone by the successive equine genera are\r\nas follows: First, increase in size; second, increase in speed, through\r\nconcentration of limb bones; third, elongation of head and neck, and\r\nmodifications of skull. The eocene Orohippus was the size of a fox.\r\nMiohippus and Anchitherium, from the miocene, were about as large as a\r\nsheep. Hipparion and Pliohippus, of the pliocene, equalled the ass in\r\nheight; while the size of the quaternary Equus was fully up to that of a\r\nmodern horse.\r\n\r\n\"The increase of speed was equally well marked, and was a direct\r\nresult of the gradual formation of the limbs. The latter were slowly\r\nconcentrated by the reduction of their lateral elements and enlargement\r\nof the axial bone, until the force exerted by each limb came to act\r\ndirectly through its axis in the line of motion. This concentration is\r\nwell seen--e.g., in the fore-limb. There was, first, a change in the\r\nscapula and humerus, especially in the latter, which facilitated motion\r\nin one line only; second, an expansion of the radius and reduction of\r\nthe ulna, until the former alone remained entire and effective; third,\r\na shortening of all the carpal bones and enlargement of the median ones,\r\ninsuring a firmer wrist; fourth, an increase of size of the third digit,\r\nat the expense of those of each side, until the former alone supported\r\nthe limb.\r\n\r\n\"Such is, in brief, a general outline of the more marked changes that\r\nseemed to have produced in America the highly specialized modern Equus\r\nfrom his diminutive four-toed predecessor, the eocene Orohippus. The\r\nline of descent appears to have been direct, and the remains now known\r\nsupply every important intermediate form. It is, of course, impossible\r\nto say with certainty through which of the three-toed genera of the\r\npliocene that lived together the succession came. It is not impossible\r\nthat the latter species, which appear generically identical, are the\r\ndescendants of more distinct pliocene types, as the persistent tendency\r\nin all the earlier forms was in the same direction. Considering the\r\nremarkable development of the group through the tertiary period, and\r\nits existence even later, it seems very strange that none of the species\r\nshould have survived, and that we are indebted for our present horse to\r\nthe Old World.\"(7)\r\n\r\n\r\nPALEONTOLOGY OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nThese and such-like revelations have come to light in our own time--are,\r\nindeed, still being disclosed. Needless to say, no index of any sort now\r\nattempts to conceal them; yet something has been accomplished towards\r\nthe same end by the publication of the discoveries in Smithsonian\r\nbulletins and in technical memoirs of government surveys. Fortunately,\r\nhowever, the results have been rescued from that partial oblivion by\r\nsuch interpreters as Professors Huxley and Cope, so the unscientific\r\npublic has been allowed to gain at least an inkling of the wonderful\r\nprogress of paleontology in our generation.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Huxley in particular epitomize the record. In 1862 he\r\nadmitted candidly that the paleontological record as then known, so far\r\nas it bears on the doctrine of progressive development, negatives\r\nthat doctrine. In 1870 he was able to \"soften somewhat the Brutus-like\r\nseverity\" of his former verdict, and to assert that the results of\r\nrecent researches seem \"to leave a clear balance in favor of the\r\ndoctrine of the evolution of living forms one from another.\" Six years\r\nlater, when reviewing the work of Marsh in America and of Gaudry\r\nin Pikermi, he declared that, \"on the evidence of paleontology, the\r\nevolution of many existing forms of animal life from their predecessors\r\nis no longer an hypothesis, but an historical fact.\" In 1881 he\r\nasserted that the evidence gathered in the previous decade had been so\r\nunequivocal that, had the transmutation hypothesis not existed, \"the\r\npaleontologist would have had to invent it.\"\r\n\r\nSince then the delvers after fossils have piled proof on proof in\r\nbewildering profusion. The fossil-beds in the \"bad lands\" of western\r\nAmerica seem inexhaustible. And in the Connecticut River Valley near\r\nrelatives of the great reptiles which Professor Marsh and others\r\nhave found in such profusion in the West left their tracks on the\r\nmud-flats--since turned to sandstone; and a few skeletons also have been\r\nfound. The bodies of a race of great reptiles that were the lords of\r\ncreation of their day have been dissipated to their elements, while the\r\nchance indentations of their feet as they raced along the shores, mere\r\nfootprints on the sands, have been preserved among the most imperishable\r\nof the memory-tablets of the world.\r\n\r\nOf the other vertebrate fossils that have been found in the eastern\r\nportions of America, among the most abundant and interesting are the\r\nskeletons of mastodons. Of these one of the largest and most complete is\r\nthat which was unearthed in the bed of a drained lake near Newburg, New\r\nYork, in 1845. This specimen was larger than the existing elephants,\r\nand had tusks eleven feet in length. It was mounted and described by Dr.\r\nJohn C. Warren, of Boston, and has been famous for half a century as the\r\n\"Warren mastodon.\"\r\n\r\nBut to the student of racial development as recorded by the fossils all\r\nthese sporadic finds have but incidental interest as compared with the\r\nrich Western fossil-beds to which we have already referred. From records\r\nhere unearthed, the racial evolution of many mammals has in the past few\r\nyears been made out in greater or less detail. Professor Cope has traced\r\nthe ancestry of the camels (which, like the rhinoceroses, hippopotami,\r\nand sundry other forms now spoken of as \"Old World,\" seem to have had\r\ntheir origin here) with much completeness.\r\n\r\nA lemuroid form of mammal, believed to be of the type from which man\r\nhas descended, has also been found in these beds. It is thought that the\r\ndescendants of this creature, and of the other \"Old-World\" forms\r\nabove referred to, found their way to Asia, probably, as suggested by\r\nProfessor Marsh, across a bridge at Bering Strait, to continue their\r\nevolution on the other hemisphere, becoming extinct in the land of their\r\nnativity. The ape-man fossil found in the tertiary strata of the island\r\nof Java in 1891 by the Dutch surgeon Dr. Eugene Dubois, and named\r\nPithecanthropus erectus, may have been a direct descendant of the\r\nAmerican tribe of primitive lemurs, though this is only a conjecture.\r\n\r\nNot all the strange beasts which have left their remains in our \"bad\r\nlands\" are represented by living descendants. The titanotheres, or\r\nbrontotheridae, for example, a gigantic tribe, offshoots of the\r\nsame stock which produced the horse and rhinoceros, represented the\r\nculmination of a line of descent. They developed rapidly in a geological\r\nsense, and flourished about the middle of the tertiary period; then,\r\nto use Agassiz's phrase,\" time fought against them.\" The story of their\r\nevolution has been worked out by Professors Leidy, Marsh, Cope, and H.\r\nF. Osborne.\r\n\r\nA recent bit of paleontological evidence bearing on the question of\r\nthe introduction of species is that presented by Dr. J. L. Wortman in\r\nconnection with the fossil lineage of the edentates. It was suggested by\r\nMarsh, in 1877, that these creatures, whose modern representatives are\r\nall South American, originated in North America long before the two\r\ncontinents had any land connection. The stages of degeneration by which\r\nthese animals gradually lost the enamel from their teeth, coming finally\r\nto the unique condition of their modern descendants of the sloth tribe,\r\nare illustrated by strikingly graded specimens now preserved in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, as shown by Dr. Wortman.\r\n\r\nAll these and a multitude of other recent observations that cannot be\r\neven outlined here tell the same story. With one accord paleontologists\r\nof our time regard the question of the introduction of new species as\r\nsolved. As Professor Marsh has said, \"to doubt evolution today is to\r\ndoubt science; and science is only another name for truth.\"\r\n\r\nThus the third great battle over the meaning of the fossil records has\r\ncome to a conclusion. Again there is a truce to controversy, and it may\r\nseem to the casual observer that the present stand of the science of\r\nfossils is final and impregnable. But does this really mean that a full\r\nsynopsis of the story of paleontology has been told? Or do we only await\r\nthe coming of the twentieth-century Lamarck or Darwin, who shall\r\nattack the fortified knowledge of to-day with the batteries of a new\r\ngeneralization?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES HUTTON\r\n\r\nOne might naturally suppose that the science of the earth which lies at\r\nman's feet would at least have kept pace with the science of the distant\r\nstars. But perhaps the very obviousness of the phenomena delayed the\r\nstudy of the crust of the earth. It is the unattainable that allures and\r\nmystifies and enchants the developing mind. The proverbial child spurns\r\nits toys and cries for the moon.\r\n\r\nSo in those closing days of the eighteenth century, when astronomers had\r\ngone so far towards explaining the mysteries of the distant portions\r\nof the universe, we find a chaos of opinion regarding the structure\r\nand formation of the earth. Guesses were not wanting to explain the\r\nformation of the world, it is true, but, with one or two exceptions,\r\nthese are bizarre indeed. One theory supposed the earth to have been at\r\nfirst a solid mass of ice, which became animated only after a comet had\r\ndashed against it. Other theories conceived the original globe as a mass\r\nof water, over which floated vapors containing the solid elements, which\r\nin due time were precipitated as a crust upon the waters. In a word, the\r\nvarious schemes supposed the original mass to have been ice, or water,\r\nor a conglomerate of water and solids, according to the random fancies\r\nof the theorists; and the final separation into land and water was\r\nconceived to have taken place in all the ways which fancy, quite\r\nunchecked by any tenable data, could invent.\r\n\r\nWhatever important changes in the general character of the surface of\r\nthe globe were conceived to have taken place since its creation were\r\ngenerally associated with the Mosaic: deluge, and the theories which\r\nattempted to explain this catastrophe were quite on a par with\r\nthose which dealt with a remoter period of the earth's history. Some\r\nspeculators, holding that the interior of the globe is a great abyss\r\nof waters, conceived that the crust had dropped into this chasm and had\r\nthus been inundated. Others held that the earth had originally revolved\r\non a vertical axis, and that the sudden change to its present position\r\nbad caused the catastrophic shifting of its oceans. But perhaps the\r\nfavorite theory was that which supposed a comet to have wandered near\r\nthe earth, and in whirling about it to have carried the waters, through\r\ngravitation, in a vast tide over the continents.\r\n\r\nThus blindly groped the majority of eighteenth-century philosophers in\r\ntheir attempts to study what we now term geology. Deluded by the old\r\ndeductive methods, they founded not a science, but the ghost of a\r\nscience, as immaterial and as unlike anything in nature as any other\r\nphantom that could be conjured from the depths of the speculative\r\nimagination. And all the while the beckoning earth lay beneath the feet\r\nof these visionaries; but their eyes were fixed in air.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, there came a man who had the penetration to see that\r\nthe phantom science of geology needed before all else a body corporeal,\r\nand who took to himself the task of supplying it. This was Dr.\r\nJames Hutton, of Edinburgh, physician, farmer, and manufacturing\r\nchemist--patient, enthusiastic, level-headed devotee of science.\r\nInspired by his love of chemistry to study the character of rocks and\r\nsoils, Hutton had not gone far before the earth stood revealed to him\r\nin a new light. He saw, what generations of predecessors had blindly\r\nrefused to see, that the face of nature everywhere, instead of being\r\nrigid and immutable, is perennially plastic, and year by year is\r\nundergoing metamorphic changes. The solidest rocks are day by day\r\ndisintegrated slowly, but none the less surely, by wind and rain and\r\nfrost, by mechanical attrition and chemical decomposition, to form the\r\npulverized earth and clay. This soil is being swept away by perennial\r\nshowers, and carried off to the oceans. The oceans themselves beat on\r\ntheir shores, and eat insidiously into the structure of sands and rocks.\r\nEverywhere, slowly but surely, the surface of the land is being worn\r\naway; its substance is being carried to burial in the seas.\r\n\r\nShould this denudation continue long enough, thinks Hutton, the entire\r\nsurface of the continents must be worn away. Should it be continued LONG\r\nENOUGH! And with that thought there flashes on his mind an inspiring\r\nconception--the idea that solar time is long, indefinitely long. That\r\nseems a simple enough thought--almost a truism--to the twentieth-century\r\nmind; but it required genius to conceive it in the eighteenth. Hutton\r\npondered it, grasped its full import, and made it the basis of his\r\nhypothesis, his \"theory of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN GEOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is this--that the observed changes of the surface of\r\nthe earth, continued through indefinite lapses of time, must result in\r\nconveying all the land at last to the sea; in wearing continents away\r\ntill the oceans overflow them. What then? Why, as the continents wear\r\ndown, the oceans are filling up. Along their bottoms the detritus of\r\nwasted continents is deposited in strata, together with the bodies of\r\nmarine animals and vegetables. Why might not this debris solidify to\r\nform layers of rocks--the basis of new continents? Why not, indeed?\r\n\r\nBut have we any proof that such formation of rocks in an ocean-bed has,\r\nin fact, occurred? To be sure we have. It is furnished by every bed\r\nof limestone, every outcropping fragment of fossil-bearing rock, every\r\nstratified cliff. How else than through such formation in an ocean-bed\r\ncame these rocks to be stratified? How else came they to contain the\r\nshells of once living organisms imbedded in their depths? The ancients,\r\nfinding fossil shells imbedded in the rocks, explained them as mere\r\nfreaks of \"nature and the stars.\" Less superstitious generations had\r\nrepudiated this explanation, but had failed to give a tenable solution\r\nof the mystery. To Hutton it is a mystery no longer. To him it seems\r\nclear that the basis of the present continents was laid in ancient\r\nsea-beds, formed of the detritus of continents yet more ancient.\r\n\r\nBut two links are still wanting to complete the chain of Hutton's\r\nhypothesis. Through what agency has the ooze of the ocean-bed been\r\ntransformed into solid rock? and through what agency has this rock been\r\nlifted above the surface of the water to form new continents? Hutton\r\nlooks about him for a clew, and soon he finds it. Everywhere about us\r\nthere are outcropping rocks that are not stratified, but which give\r\nevidence to the observant eye of having once been in a molten state.\r\nDifferent minerals are mixed together; pebbles are scattered through\r\nmasses of rock like plums in a pudding; irregular crevices in otherwise\r\nsolid masses of rock--so-called veinings--are seen to be filled with\r\nequally solid granite of a different variety, which can have gotten\r\nthere in no conceivable way, so Hutton thinks, but by running in while\r\nmolten, as liquid metal is run into the moulds of the founder. Even\r\nthe stratified rocks, though they seemingly have not been melted, give\r\nevidence in some instances of having been subjected to the action of\r\nheat. Marble, for example, is clearly nothing but calcined limestone.\r\n\r\nWith such evidence before him, Hutton is at no loss to complete his\r\nhypothesis. The agency which has solidified the ocean-beds, he says,\r\nis subterranean heat. The same agency, acting excessively, has produced\r\nvolcanic cataclysms, upheaving ocean-beds to form continents. The rugged\r\nand uneven surfaces of mountains, the tilted and broken character\r\nof stratified rocks everywhere, are the standing witnesses of these\r\ngigantic upheavals.\r\n\r\nAnd with this the imagined cycle is complete. The continents, worn away\r\nand carried to the sea by the action of the elements, have been made\r\nover into rocks again in the ocean-beds, and then raised once more into\r\ncontinents. And this massive cycle, In Hutton's scheme, is supposed\r\nto have occurred not once only, but over and over again, times without\r\nnumber. In this unique view ours is indeed a world without beginning\r\nand without end; its continents have been making and unmaking in endless\r\nseries since time began.\r\n\r\nHutton formulated his hypothesis while yet a young man, not long after\r\nthe middle of the century. He first gave it publicity in 1781, in a\r\npaper before the Royal Society of Edinburgh:\r\n\r\n\"A solid body of land could not have answered the purpose of a habitable\r\nworld,\" said Hutton, \"for a soil is necessary to the growth of plants,\r\nand a soil is nothing but the material collected from the destruction of\r\nthe solid land. Therefore the surface of this land inhabited by man, and\r\ncovered by plants and animals, is made by nature to decay, in dissolving\r\nfrom that hard and compact state in which it is found; and this soil\r\nis necessarily washed away by the continual circulation of the water\r\nrunning from the summits of the mountains towards the general receptacle\r\nof that fluid.\r\n\r\n\"The heights of our land are thus levelled with our shores, our fertile\r\nplains are formed from the ruins of the mountains; and those travelling\r\nmaterials are still pursued by the moving water, and propelled along the\r\ninclined surface of the earth. These movable materials, delivered into\r\nthe sea, cannot, for a long continuance, rest upon the shore, for by the\r\nagitation of the winds, the tides, and the currents every movable thing\r\nis carried farther and farther along the shelving bottom of the sea,\r\ntowards the unfathomable regions of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"If the vegetable soil is thus constantly removed from the surface of\r\nthe land, and if its place is then to be supplied from the dissolution\r\nof the solid earth as here represented, we may perceive an end to this\r\nbeautiful machine; an end arising from no error in its constitution as\r\na world, but from that destructibility of its land which is so necessary\r\nin the system of the globe, in the economy of life and vegetation.\r\n\r\n\"The immense time necessarily required for the total destruction of\r\nthe land must not be opposed to that view of future events which is\r\nindicated by the surest facts and most approved principles. Time, which\r\nmeasures everything in our idea, and is often deficient to our schemes,\r\nis to nature endless and as nothing; it cannot limit that by which alone\r\nit has existence; and as the natural course of time, which to us seems\r\ninfinite, cannot be bounded by any operation that may have an end, the\r\nprogress of things upon this globe that in the course of nature cannot\r\nbe limited by time must proceed in a continual succession. We are,\r\ntherefore, to consider as inevitable the destruction of our land, so far\r\nas effected by those operations which are necessary in the purpose of\r\nthe globe, considered as a habitable world, and so far as we have\r\nnot examined any other part of the economy of nature, in which other\r\noperations and a different intention might appear.\r\n\r\n\"We have now considered the globe of this earth as a machine,\r\nconstructed upon chemical as well as mechanical principles, by which its\r\ndifferent parts are all adapted, in form, in quality, and quantity, to a\r\ncertain end--an end attained with certainty of success, and an end from\r\nwhich we may perceive wisdom in contemplating the means employed.\r\n\r\n\"But is this world to be considered thus merely as a machine, to last no\r\nlonger than its parts retain their present position, their proper forms\r\nand qualities? Or may it not be also considered as an organized body\r\nsuch as has a constitution, in which the necessary decay of the machine\r\nis naturally repaired in the exertion of those productive powers by\r\nwhich it has been formed?\r\n\r\n\"This is the view in which we are now to examine the globe; to see if\r\nthere be, in the constitution of the world, a reproductive operation\r\nby which a ruined constitution may be again repaired and a duration of\r\nstability thus procured to the machine considered as a world containing\r\nplants and animals.\r\n\r\n\"If no such reproductive power, or reforming operation, after due\r\ninquiry, is to be found in the constitution of this world, we should\r\nhave reason to conclude that the system of this earth has either been\r\nintentionally made imperfect or has not been the work of infinite power\r\nand wisdom.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the important question to be answered--the question of\r\nthe constitution of the globe. To accomplish this, it was necessary,\r\nfirst of all, to examine without prejudice the material already in hand,\r\nadding such new discoveries from time to time as might be made, but\r\nalways applying to the whole unvarying scientific principles and\r\ninductive methods of reasoning.\r\n\r\n\"If we are to take the written history of man for the rule by which we\r\nshould judge of the time when the species first began,\" said Hutton,\r\n\"that period would be but little removed from the present state of\r\nthings. The Mosaic history places this beginning of man at no great\r\ndistance; and there has not been found, in natural history, any document\r\nby which high antiquity might be attributed to the human race. But\r\nthis is not the case with regard to the inferior species of animals,\r\nparticularly those which inhabit the ocean and its shores. We find\r\nin natural history monuments which prove that those animals had long\r\nexisted; and we thus procure a measure for the computation of a period\r\nof time extremely remote, though far from being precisely ascertained.\r\n\r\n\"In examining things present, we have data from which to reason with\r\nregard to what has been; and from what actually has been we have\r\ndata for concluding with regard to that which is to happen hereafter.\r\nTherefore, upon the supposition that the operations of nature are\r\nequable and steady, we find, in natural appearances, means for\r\nconcluding a certain portion of time to have necessarily elapsed in the\r\nproduction of those events of which we see the effects.\r\n\r\n\"It is thus that, in finding the relics of sea animals of every kind\r\nin the solid body of our earth, a natural history of those animals\r\nis formed, which includes a certain portion of time; and for the\r\nascertaining this portion of time we must again have recourse to the\r\nregular operations of this world. We shall thus arrive at facts which\r\nindicate a period to which no other species of chronology is able to\r\nremount.\r\n\r\n\"We find the marks of marine animals in the most solid parts of the\r\nearth, consequently those solid parts have been formed after the ocean\r\nwas inhabited by those animals which are proper to that fluid medium.\r\nIf, therefore, we knew the natural history of these solid parts, and\r\ncould trace the operations of the globe by which they have been formed,\r\nwe would have some means for computing the time through which those\r\nspecies of animals have continued to live. But how shall we describe a\r\nprocess which nobody has seen performed and of which no written history\r\ngives any account? This is only to be investigated, first, in examining\r\nthe nature of those solid bodies the history of which we want to know;\r\nand, secondly, in examining the natural operations of the globe, in\r\norder to see if there now exist such operations as, from the nature of\r\nthe solid bodies, appear to have been necessary for their formation.\r\n\r\n\"There are few beds of marble or limestone in which may not be found\r\nsome of those objects which indicate the marine object of the mass. If,\r\nfor example, in a mass of marble taken from a quarry upon the top of the\r\nAlps or Andes there shall be found one cockle-shell or piece of coral,\r\nit must be concluded that this bed of stone has been originally formed\r\nat the bottom of the sea, as much as another bed which is evidently\r\ncomposed almost altogether of cockle-shells and coral. If one bed of\r\nlimestone is thus found to have been of marine origin, every concomitant\r\nbed of the same kind must be also concluded to have been formed in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\n\"In those calcareous strata, which are evidently of marine origin,\r\nthere are many parts which are of sparry structure--that is to say, the\r\noriginal texture of those beds in such places has been dissolved, and a\r\nnew structure has been assumed which is peculiar to a certain state of\r\nthe calcareous earth. This change is produced by crystallization, in\r\nconsequence of a previous state of fluidity, which has so disposed\r\nthe concerting parts as to allow them to assume a regular shape and\r\nstructure proper to that substance. A body whose external form has\r\nbeen modified by this process is called a CRYSTAL; one whose internal\r\narrangement of parts is determined by it is said to be of a SPARRY\r\nSTRUCTURE, and this is known from its fracture.\r\n\r\n\"There are, in all the regions of the earth, huge masses of calcareous\r\nmatter in that crystalline form or sparry state in which, perhaps, no\r\nvestige can be found of any organized body, nor any indication that such\r\ncalcareous matter has belonged to animals; but as in other masses this\r\nsparry structure or crystalline state is evidently assumed by the marine\r\ncalcareous substances in operations which are natural to the globe,\r\nand which are necessary to the consolidation of the strata, it does not\r\nappear that the sparry masses in which no figured body is formed\r\nhave been originally different from other masses, which, being only\r\ncrystallized in part, and in part still retaining their original form,\r\nhave ample evidence of their marine origin.\r\n\r\n\"We are led, in this manner, to conclude that all the strata of the\r\nearth, not only those consisting of such calcareous masses, but others\r\nsuperincumbent upon these, have had their origin at the bottom of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"The general amount of our reasoning is this, that nine-tenths, perhaps,\r\nor ninety-nine-hundredths, of this earth, so far as we see, have been\r\nformed by natural operations of the globe in collecting loose materials\r\nand depositing them at the bottom of the sea; consolidating those\r\ncollections in various degrees, and either elevating those consolidated\r\nmasses above the level on which they were formed or lowering the level\r\nof that sea.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now consider how far the other proposition of strata being\r\nelevated by the power of heat above the level of the sea may be\r\nconfirmed from the examination of natural appearances. The strata formed\r\nat the bottom of the ocean are necessarily horizontal in their position,\r\nor nearly so, and continuous in their horizontal direction or extent.\r\nThey may be changed and gradually assume the nature of each other, so\r\nfar as concerns the materials of which they are formed, but there cannot\r\nbe any sudden change, fracture, or displacement naturally in the body\r\nof a stratum. But if the strata are cemented by the heat of fusion,\r\nand erected with an expansive power acting below, we may expect to find\r\nevery species of fracture, dislocation, and contortion in those bodies\r\nand every degree of departure from a horizontal towards a vertical\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"The strata of the globe are actually found in every possible position:\r\nfor from horizontal they are frequently found vertical; from continuous\r\nthey are broken and separated in every possible direction; and from a\r\nplane they are bent and doubled. It is impossible that they could have\r\noriginally been formed, by the known laws of nature, in their present\r\nstate and position; and the power that has been necessarily required\r\nfor their change has not been inferior to that which might have been\r\nrequired for their elevation from the place in which they have been\r\nformed.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom all this, therefore, Hutton reached the conclusion that the\r\nelevation of the bodies of land above the water on the earth's surface\r\nhad been effected by the same force which had acted in consolidating the\r\nstrata and giving them stability. This force he conceived to be exerted\r\nby the expansion of heated matter.\r\n\r\n\"We have,\" he said, \"been now supposing that the beginning of our\r\npresent earth had been laid in the bottom of the ocean, at the\r\ncompletion of the former land, but this was only for the sake of\r\ndistinctness. The just view is this, that when the former land of the\r\nglobe had been complete, so as to begin to waste and be impaired by\r\nthe encroachment of the sea, the present land began to appear above the\r\nsurface of the ocean. In this manner we suppose a due proportion to be\r\nalways preserved of land and water upon the surface of the globe, for\r\nthe purpose of a habitable world such as this which we possess. We\r\nthus also allow time and opportunity for the translation of animals and\r\nplants to occupy the earth.\r\n\r\n\"But if the earth on which we live began to appear in the ocean at\r\nthe time when the LAST began to be resolved, it could not be from the\r\nmaterials of the continent immediately preceding this which we examine\r\nthat the present earth has been constructed; for the bottom of the ocean\r\nmust have been filled with materials before land could be made to appear\r\nabove its surface.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose that the continent which is to succeed our land is at\r\npresent beginning to appear above the water in the middle of the Pacific\r\nOcean; it must be evident that the materials of this great body, which\r\nis formed and ready to be brought forth, must have been collected from\r\nthe destruction of an earth which does not now appear. Consequently,\r\nin this true statement of the case there is necessarily required the\r\ndestruction of an animal and vegetable earth prior to the former land;\r\nand the materials of that earth which is first in our account must have\r\nbeen collected at the bottom of the ocean, and begun to be concocted for\r\nthe production of the present earth, when the land immediately preceding\r\nthe present had arrived at its full extent.\r\n\r\n\"We have now got to the end of our reasoning; we have no data further\r\nto conclude immediately from that which actually is; but we have got\r\nenough; we have the satisfaction to find that in nature there are\r\nwisdom, system, and consistency. For having in the natural history of\r\nthe earth seen a succession of worlds, we may from this conclude that\r\nthere is a system in nature; in like manner as, from seeing revolutions\r\nof the planets, it is concluded that there is a system by which they are\r\nintended to continue those revolutions. But if the succession of worlds\r\nis established in the system of nature, it is in vain to look for\r\nanything higher in the origin of the earth. The result, therefore,\r\nof our present inquiry is that we find no vestige of a beginning--no\r\nprospect of an end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAltogether remarkable as this paper seems in the light of later\r\nknowledge, neither friend nor foe deigned to notice it at the moment.\r\nIt was not published in book form until the last decade of the century,\r\nwhen Hutton had lived with and worked over his theory for almost fifty\r\nyears. Then it caught the eye of the world. A school of followers\r\nexpounded the Huttonian doctrines; a rival school under Werner in\r\nGermany opposed some details of the hypothesis, and the educated world\r\nas a whole viewed the disputants askance. The very novelty of the new\r\nviews forbade their immediate acceptance. Bitter attacks were made upon\r\nthe \"heresies,\" and that was meant to be a soberly tempered judgment\r\nwhich in 1800 pronounced Hutton's theories \"not only hostile to sacred\r\nhistory, but equally hostile to the principles of probability, to the\r\nresults of the ablest observations on the mineral kingdom, and to the\r\ndictates of rational philosophy.\" And all this because Hutton's theory\r\npresupposed the earth to have been in existence more than six thousand\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that though the thoughts of men had widened, in those\r\nclosing days of the eighteenth century, to include the stars, they had\r\nnot as yet expanded to receive the most patent records that are written\r\neverywhere on the surface of the earth. Before Hutton's views could be\r\naccepted, his pivotal conception that time is long must be established\r\nby convincing proofs. The evidence was being gathered by William Smith,\r\nCuvier, and other devotees of the budding science of paleontology in\r\nthe last days of the century, but their labors were not brought to\r\ncompletion till a subsequent epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEPTUNISTS VERSUS PLUTONISTS\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, James Hutton's theory that continents wear away and\r\nare replaced by volcanic upheaval gained comparatively few adherents.\r\nEven the lucid Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory, which Playfair,\r\nthe pupil and friend of the great Scotchman, published in 1802, did not\r\nat once prove convincing. The world had become enamoured of the rival\r\ntheory of Hutton's famous contemporary, Werner of Saxony--the theory\r\nwhich taught that \"in the beginning\" all the solids of the earth's\r\npresent crust were dissolved in the heated waters of a universal sea.\r\nWerner affirmed that all rocks, of whatever character, had been formed\r\nby precipitation from this sea as the waters cooled; that even veins\r\nhave originated in this way; and that mountains are gigantic crystals,\r\nnot upheaved masses. In a word, he practically ignored volcanic action,\r\nand denied in toto the theory of metamorphosis of rocks through the\r\nagency of heat.\r\n\r\nThe followers of Werner came to be known as Neptunists; the Huttonians\r\nas Plutonists. The history of geology during the first quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century is mainly a recital of the intemperate controversy\r\nbetween these opposing schools; though it should not be forgotten that,\r\nmeantime, the members of the Geological Society of London were making\r\nan effort to hunt for facts and avoid compromising theories. Fact and\r\ntheory, however, were too closely linked to be thus divorced.\r\n\r\nThe brunt of the controversy settled about the unstratified\r\nrocks--granites and their allies--which the Plutonists claimed as of\r\nigneous origin. This contention had the theoretical support of the\r\nnebular hypothesis, then gaining ground, which supposed the earth to be\r\na cooling globe. The Plutonists laid great stress, too, on the observed\r\nfact that the temperature of the earth increases at a pretty constant\r\nratio as descent towards its centre is made in mines. But in particular\r\nthey appealed to the phenomena of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe evidence from this source was gathered and elaborated by Mr. G.\r\nPoulett Scrope, secretary of the Geological Society of England, who, in\r\n1823, published a classical work on volcanoes in which he claimed that\r\nvolcanic mountains, including some of the highest-known peaks, are\r\nmerely accumulated masses of lava belched forth from a crevice in the\r\nearth's crust.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing the globe to have had any irregular shape when detached from\r\nthe sun,\" said Scrope, \"the vaporization of its surface, and, of course,\r\nof its projecting angles, together with its rotatory motion on its axis\r\nand the liquefaction of its outer envelope, would necessarily occasion\r\nits actual figure of an oblate spheroid. As the process of expansion\r\nproceeded in depth, the original granitic beds were first partially\r\ndisaggregated, next disintegrated, and more or less liquefied,\r\nthe crystals being merged in the elastic vehicle produced by the\r\nvaporization of the water contained between the laminae.\r\n\r\n\"Where this fluid was produced in abundance by great dilatation--that\r\nis, in the outer and highly disintegrated strata, the superior specific\r\ngravity of the crystals forced it to ooze upward, and thus a great\r\nquantity of aqueous vapor was produced on the surface of the globe. As\r\nthis elastic fluid rose into outer space, its continually increasing\r\nexpansion must have proportionately lowered its temperature; and, in\r\nconsequence, a part was recondensed into water and sank back towards the\r\nmore solid surface of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"And in this manner, for a certain time, a violent reciprocation of\r\natmospheric phenomena must have continued--torrents of vapor rising\r\noutwardly, while equally tremendous torrents of condensed vapor, or\r\nrain, fell towards the earth. The accumulation of the latter on the\r\nyet unstable and unconsolidated surface of the globe constituted the\r\nprimeval ocean. The surface of this ocean was exposed to continued\r\nvaporization owing to intense heat; but this process, abstracting\r\ncaloric from the stratum of the water below, by partially cooling it,\r\ntended to preserve the remainder in a liquid form. The ocean will have\r\ncontained, both in solution and suspension, many of the matters carried\r\nupward from the granitic bed in which the vapors from whose condensation\r\nit proceeded were produced, and which they had traversed in their rise.\r\nThe dissolved matters will have been silex, carbonates, and sulphates\r\nof lime, and those other mineral substances which water at an intense\r\ntemperature and under such circumstances was enabled to hold in\r\nsolution. The suspended substances will have been all the lighter and\r\nfiner particles of the upper beds where the disintegration had been\r\nextreme; and particularly their mica, which, owing to the tenuity of its\r\nplate-shaped crystals, would be most readily carried up by the ascending\r\nfluid, and will have remained longest in suspension.\r\n\r\n\"But as the torrents of vapor, holding these various matters in\r\nsolution and suspension, were forced upward, the greater part of the\r\ndisintegrated crystals by degrees subsided; those of felspar and quartz\r\nfirst, the mica being, as observed above, from the form of its plates,\r\nof peculiar buoyancy, and therefore held longest in suspension.\r\n\r\n\"The crystals of felspar and quartz as they subsided, together with a\r\nsmall proportion of mica, would naturally arrange themselves so as to\r\nhave their longest dimensions more or less parallel to the surface on\r\nwhich they rest; and this parallelism would be subsequently increased,\r\nas we shall see hereafter, by the pressure of these beds sustained\r\nbetween the weight of the supported column of matter and the expansive\r\nforce beneath them. These beds I conceive, when consolidated, to\r\nconstitute the gneiss formation.\r\n\r\n\"The farther the process of expansion proceeded in depth, the more was\r\nthe column of liquid matter lengthened, which, gravitating towards\r\nthe centre of the globe, tended to check any further expansion. It is,\r\ntherefore, obvious that after the globe settled into its actual orbit,\r\nand thenceforward lost little of its enveloping matter, the whole\r\nof which began from that moment to gravitate towards its centre, the\r\nprogress of expansion inwardly would continually increase in rapidity;\r\nand a moment must have at length arrived hen the forces of expansion and\r\nrepression had reached an equilibrium and the process was stopped from\r\nprogressing farther inwardly by the great pressure of the gravitating\r\ncolumn of liquid.\r\n\r\n\"This column may be considered as consisting of different strata, though\r\nthe passage from one extremity of complete solidity to the other of\r\ncomplete expansion, in reality, must have been perfectly gradual. The\r\nlowest stratum, immediately above the extreme limit of expansion, will\r\nhave been granite barely DISAGGREGATED, and rendered imperfectly liquid\r\nby the partial vaporization of its contained water.\r\n\r\n\"The second stratum was granite DISINTEGRATED; aqueous vapor, having\r\nbeen produced in such abundance as to be enabled to rise upward,\r\npartially disintegrating the crystals of felspar and mica, and\r\nsuperficially dissolving those of quartz. This mass would reconsolidate\r\ninto granite, though of a smaller grain than the preceding rock.\r\n\r\n\"The third stratum was so disintegrated that a greater part of the mica\r\nhad been carried up by the escaping vapor IN SUSPENSION, and that of\r\nquartz in solution; the felspar crystals, with the remaining quartz and\r\nmica, SUBSIDING by their specific gravity and arranging themselves in\r\nhorizontal planes.\r\n\r\n\"The consolidation of this stratum produced the gneiss formation.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth zone will have been composed of the ocean of turbid and\r\nheated water, holding mica, etc., in suspension, and quartz, carbonate\r\nof lime, etc., in solution, and continually traversed by reciprocating\r\nbodies of heated water rising from below, and of cold fluid sinking from\r\nthe surface, by reason of their specific gravities.\r\n\r\n\"The disturbance thus occasioned will have long retarded the deposition\r\nof the suspended particles. But this must by degrees have taken place,\r\nthe quartz grains and the larger and coarser plates of mica subsiding\r\nfirst and the finest last.\r\n\r\n\"But the fragments of quartz and mica were not deposited alone; a great\r\nproportion of the quartz held in SOLUTION must have been precipitated\r\nat the same time as the water cooled, and therefore by degrees lost\r\nits faculty of so much in solution. Thus was gradually produced the\r\nformation of mica-schist, the mica imperfectly recrystallizing or being\r\nmerely aggregated together in horizontal plates, between which the\r\nquartz either spread itself generally in minute grains or unified into\r\ncrystalline nuclei. On other spots, instead of silex, carbonate of lime\r\nwas precipitated, together with more or less of the nucaceous sediment,\r\nand gave rise to saccharoidal limestones. At a later period, when the\r\nocean was yet further cooled down, rock-salt and sulphate of lime were\r\nlocally precipitated in a similar mode.\r\n\r\n\"The fifth stratum was aeriform, and consisted in great part of\r\naqueous vapors; the remainder being a compound of other elastic fluids\r\n(permanent gases) which had been formed probably from the volatilization\r\nof some of the substances contained in the primitive granite and carried\r\nupward with the aqueous vapor from below. These gases will have\r\nbeen either mixed together or otherwise disposed, according to their\r\ndifferent specific gravities or chemical affinities, and this stratum\r\nconstituted the atmosphere or aerial envelope of the globe.\r\n\r\n\"When, in this manner, the general and positive expansion of the globe,\r\noccasioned by the sudden reduction of outward pressure, had ceased (in\r\nconsequence of the REPRESSIVE FORCE, consisting of the weight of its\r\nfluid envelope, having reached an equilibrium with the EXPANSIVE FORCE,\r\nconsisting of the caloric of the heated nucleus), the rapid superficial\r\nevaporation of the ocean continued; and, by gradually reducing its\r\ntemperature, occasioned the precipitation of a proportionate quantity\r\nof the minerals it held in solution, particularly its silex. These\r\nsubstances falling to the bottom, accompanied by a large proportion of\r\nthe matters held in solution, particularly the mica, in consequence of\r\nthe greater comparative tranquillity of the ocean, agglomerated these\r\ninto more or less compact beds of rock (the mica-schist formation),\r\nproducing the first crust or solid envelope of the globe. Upon this,\r\nother stratified rocks, composed sometimes of a mixture, sometimes of\r\nan alternation of precipitations, sediments, and occasionally of\r\nconglomerates, were by degrees deposited, giving rise to the TRANSITION\r\nformations.\r\n\r\n\"Beneath this crust a new process now commenced. The outer zones of\r\ncrystalline matter having been suddenly refrigerated by the rapid\r\nvaporization and partial escape of the water they contained, abstracted\r\ncaloric from the intensely heated nucleus of the globe. These\r\ncrystalline zones were of unequal density, the expansion they had\r\nsuffered diminishing from above downward.\r\n\r\n\"Their expansive force was, however, equal at all points, their\r\ntemperature everywhere bearing an inverse ratio to their density. But\r\nwhen by the accession of caloric from the inner and unliquefied nucleus\r\nthe temperature, and consequently the expansive force of the lower\r\nstrata of dilated crystalline matter, was augmented, it acted upon the\r\nupper and more liquefied strata. These being prevented from yielding\r\nOUTWARDLY by the tenacity and weight of the solid involucrum of\r\nprecipitated and sedimental deposits which overspread them, sustained\r\na pressure out of proportion to their expansive force, and were in\r\nconsequence proportionately condensed, and by the continuance of the\r\nprocess, where the overlying strata were sufficiently resistant, finally\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\n\"This process of consolidation must have progressed from above downward,\r\nwith the increase of the expansive force in the lower strata, commencing\r\nfrom the upper surface, which, its temperature being lowest, offered the\r\nleast resistance to the force of compression.\r\n\r\n\"By this process the upper zone of crystalline matter, which had\r\nintumesced so far as to allow of the escape of its aqueous vapor and of\r\nmuch of its mica and quartz, was resolidified, the component crystals\r\narranging themselves in planes perpendicular to the direction of the\r\npressure by which the mass was consolidated--that is, to the radius of\r\nthe globe. The gneiss formation, as already observed, was the result.\r\n\r\n\"The inferior zone of barely disintegrated granite, from which only\r\na part of the steam and quartz and none of the mica had escaped,\r\nreconsolidated in a confused or granitoidal manner; but exhibits marks\r\nof the process it had undergone in its broken crystals of felspar and\r\nmica, its rounded and superficially dissolved grains of quartz, its\r\nimbedded fragments (broken from the more solid parts of the mass, as it\r\nrose, and enveloped by the softer parts), its concretionary nodules and\r\nnew minerals, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Beneath this, the granite which had been simply disintegrated was again\r\nsolidified, and returned in all respects to its former condition. The\r\ntemperature, however, and with it the expansive force of the inferior\r\nzone, was continually on the increase, the caloric of the interior of\r\nthe globe still endeavoring to put itself in equilibrio by passing off\r\ntowards the less-intensely heated crust.\r\n\r\n\"This continually increasing expansive force must at length have\r\novercome the resistance opposed by the tenacity and weight of the\r\noverlying consolidated strata. It is reasonable to suppose that this\r\nresult took place contemporaneously, or nearly so, on many spots,\r\nwherever accidental circumstances in the texture or composition of the\r\noceanic deposits led them to yield more readily; and in this manner\r\nwere produced those original fissures in the primeval crust of the earth\r\nthrough some of which (fissures of elevation) were intruded portions of\r\ninterior crystalline zones in a solid or nearly solid state, together\r\nwith more or less of the intumescent granite, in the manner\r\nabove described; while others (fissures of eruption) gave rise to\r\nextravasations of the heated crystalline matter, in the form of\r\nlavas--that is, still further liquefied by the greater comparative\r\nreduction of the pressure they endured.\"(3)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neptunists stoutly contended for the aqueous origin of volcanic as\r\nof other mountains. But the facts were with Scrope, and as time went\r\non it came to be admitted that not merely volcanoes, but many \"trap\"\r\nformations not taking the form of craters, had been made by the\r\nobtrusion of molten rock through fissures in overlying strata. Such,\r\nfor example, to cite familiar illustrations, are Mount Holyoke, in\r\nMassachusetts, and the well-known formation of the Palisades along the\r\nHudson.\r\n\r\nBut to admit the \"Plutonic\" origin of such widespread formations was\r\npractically to abandon the Neptunian hypothesis. So gradually the\r\nHuttonian explanation of the origin of granites and other \"igneous\"\r\nrocks, whether massed or in veins, came to be accepted. Most geologists\r\nthen came to think of the earth as a molten mass, on which the crust\r\nrests as a mere film. Some, indeed, with Lyell, preferred to believe\r\nthat the molten areas exist only as lakes in a solid crust, heated to\r\nmelting, perhaps, by electrical or chemical action, as Davy suggested.\r\nMore recently a popular theory attempts to reconcile geological facts\r\nwith the claim of the physicists, that the earth's entire mass is at\r\nleast as rigid as steel, by supposing that a molten film rests between\r\nthe observed solid crust and the alleged solid nucleus. But be that\r\nas it may, the theory that subterranean heat has been instrumental in\r\ndetermining the condition of \"primary\" rocks, and in producing many\r\nother phenomena of the earth's crust, has never been in dispute since\r\nthe long controversy between the Neptunists and the Plutonists led to\r\nits establishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYELL AND UNIFORMITARIANISM\r\n\r\nIf molten matter exists beneath the crust of the earth, it must contract\r\nin cooling, and in so doing it must disturb the level of the portion of\r\nthe crust already solidified. So a plausible explanation of the upheaval\r\nof continents and mountains was supplied by the Plutonian theory, as\r\nHutton had from the first alleged. But now an important difference\r\nof opinion arose as to the exact rationale of such upheavals. Hutton\r\nhimself, and practically every one else who accepted his theory, had\r\nsupposed that there are long periods of relative repose, during which\r\nthe level of the crust is undisturbed, followed by short periods of\r\nactive stress, when continents are thrown up with volcanic suddenness,\r\nas by the throes of a gigantic earthquake. But now came Charles Lyell\r\nwith his famous extension of the \"uniformitarian\" doctrine, claiming\r\nthat past changes of the earth's surface have been like present changes\r\nin degree as well as in kind. The making of continents and mountains,\r\nhe said, is going on as rapidly to-day as at any time in the past. There\r\nhave been no gigantic cataclysmic upheavals at any time, but all\r\nchanges in level of the strata as a whole have been gradual, by slow\r\noscillation, or at most by repeated earthquake shocks such as are still\r\noften experienced.\r\n\r\nIn support of this very startling contention Lyell gathered a mass\r\nof evidence of the recent changes in level of continental areas. He\r\ncorroborated by personal inspection the claim which had been made by\r\nPlayfair in 1802, and by Von Buch in 1807, that the coast-line of Sweden\r\nis rising at the rate of from a few inches to several feet in a\r\ncentury. He cited Darwin's observations going to prove that Patagonia is\r\nsimilarly rising, and Pingel's claim that Greenland is slowly sinking.\r\nProof as to sudden changes of level of several feet, over large areas,\r\ndue to earthquakes, was brought forward in abundance. Cumulative\r\nevidence left it no longer open to question that such oscillatory\r\nchanges of level, either upward or downward, are quite the rule, and\r\nit could not be denied that these observed changes, if continued long\r\nenough in one direction, would produce the highest elevations. The\r\npossibility that the making of even the highest ranges of mountains had\r\nbeen accomplished without exaggerated catastrophic action came to be\r\nfreely admitted.\r\n\r\nIt became clear that the supposedly stable-land surfaces are in\r\nreality much more variable than the surface of the \"shifting sea\"; that\r\ncontinental masses, seemingly so fixed, are really rising and falling\r\nin billows thousands of feet in height, ages instead of moments being\r\nconsumed in the sweep between crest and hollow.\r\n\r\nThese slow oscillations of land surfaces being understood, many\r\ngeological enigmas were made clear--such as the alternation of marine\r\nand fresh-water formations in a vertical series, which Cuvier and\r\nBrongniart had observed near Paris; or the sandwiching of layers of\r\ncoal, of subaerial formation, between layers of subaqueous clay or\r\nsandstone, which may be observed everywhere in the coal measures. In\r\nparticular, the extreme thickness of the sedimentary strata as a whole,\r\nmany times exceeding the depth of the deepest known sea, was for the\r\nfirst time explicable when it was understood that such strata had formed\r\nin slowly sinking ocean-beds.\r\n\r\nAll doubt as to the mode of origin of stratified rocks being thus\r\nremoved, the way was opened for a more favorable consideration of\r\nthat other Huttonian doctrine of the extremely slow denudation of land\r\nsurfaces. The enormous amount of land erosion will be patent to any\r\none who uses his eyes intelligently in a mountain district. It will be\r\nevident in any region where the strata are tilted--as, for example, the\r\nAlleghanies--that great folds of strata which must once have risen miles\r\nin height have in many cases been worn entirely away, so that now a\r\nvalley marks the location of the former eminence. Where the strata are\r\nlevel, as in the case of the mountains of Sicily, the Scotch Highlands,\r\nand the familiar Catskills, the evidence of denudation is, if possible,\r\neven more marked; for here it is clear that elevation and valley have\r\nbeen carved by the elements out of land that rose from the sea as level\r\nplateaus.\r\n\r\nBut that this herculean labor of land-sculpturing could have been\r\naccomplished by the slow action of wind and frost and shower was an\r\nidea few men could grasp within the first half-century after Hutton\r\npropounded it; nor did it begin to gain general currency until Lyell's\r\ncrusade against catastrophism, begun about 1830, had for a quarter of a\r\ncentury accustomed geologists to the thought of slow, continuous changes\r\nproducing final results of colossal proportions. And even long after\r\nthat it was combated by such men as Murchison, Director-General of\r\nthe Geological Survey of Great Britain, then accounted the foremost\r\nfield-geologist of his time, who continued to believe that the existing\r\nvalleys owe their main features to subterranean forces of upheaval.\r\nEven Murchison, however, made some recession from the belief of the\r\nContinental authorities, Elie de Beaumont and Leopold von Buch,\r\nwho contended that the mountains had sprung up like veritable\r\njacks-in-the-box. Von Buch, whom his friend and fellow-pupil Von\r\nHumboldt considered the foremost geologist of the time, died in 1853,\r\nstill firm in his early faith that the erratic bowlders found high on\r\nthe Jura had been hurled there, like cannon-balls, across the valley of\r\nGeneva by the sudden upheaval of a neighboring mountain-range.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ AND THE GLACIAL THEORY\r\n\r\nThe bowlders whose presence on the crags of the Jura the old Gerinan\r\naccounted for in a manner so theatrical had long been a source of\r\ncontention among geologists. They are found not merely on the Jura,\r\nbut on numberless other mountains in all north-temperate latitudes, and\r\noften far out in the open country, as many a farmer who has broken his\r\nplough against them might testify. The early geologists accounted for\r\nthem, as for nearly everything else, with their supposititious Deluge.\r\nBrongniart and Cuvier and Buckland and their contemporaries appeared\r\nto have no difficulty in conceiving that masses of granite weighing\r\nhundreds of tons had been swept by this current scores or hundreds\r\nof miles from their source. But, of course, the uniformitarian faith\r\npermitted no such explanation, nor could it countenance the projection\r\nidea; so Lyell was bound to find some other means of transportation for\r\nthe puzzling erratics.\r\n\r\nThe only available medium was ice, but, fortunately, this one seemed\r\nquite sufficient. Icebergs, said Lyell, are observed to carry all manner\r\nof debris, and deposit it in the sea-bottoms. Present land surfaces\r\nhave often been submerged beneath the sea. During the latest of these\r\nsubmergences icebergs deposited the bowlders now scattered here\r\nand there over the land. Nothing could be simpler or more clearly\r\nuniformitarian. And even the catastrophists, though they met Lyell\r\namicably on almost no other theoretical ground, were inclined to admit\r\nthe plausibility of his theory of erratics. Indeed, of all Lyell's\r\nnonconformist doctrines, this seemed the one most likely to meet with\r\ngeneral acceptance.\r\n\r\nYet, even as this iceberg theory loomed large and larger before the\r\ngeological world, observations were making in a different field that\r\nwere destined to show its fallacy. As early as 1815 a sharp-eyed\r\nchamois-hunter of the Alps, Perraudin by name, had noted the existence\r\nof the erratics, and, unlike most of his companion hunters, had puzzled\r\nhis head as to how the bowlders got where he saw them. He knew nothing\r\nof submerged continents or of icebergs, still less of upheaving\r\nmountains; and though he doubtless had heard of the Flood, he had no\r\nexperience of heavy rocks floating like corks in water. Moreover, he\r\nhad never observed stones rolling uphill and perching themselves on\r\nmountain-tops, and he was a good enough uniformitarian (though he would\r\nhave been puzzled indeed had any one told him so) to disbelieve that\r\nstones in past times had disported themselves differently in this regard\r\nfrom stones of the present. Yet there the stones are. How did they get\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nThe mountaineer thought that he could answer that question. He saw about\r\nhim those gigantic serpent-like streams of ice called glaciers, \"from\r\ntheir far fountains slow rolling on,\" carrying with them blocks of\r\ngranite and other debris to form moraine deposits. If these glaciers had\r\nonce been much more extensive than they now are, they might have carried\r\nthe bowlders and left them where we find them. On the other hand, no\r\nother natural agency within the sphere of the chamois-hunter's knowledge\r\ncould have accomplished this, ergo the glaciers must once have been more\r\nextensive. Perraudin would probably have said that common-sense drove\r\nhim to this conclusion; but be that as it may, he had conceived one of\r\nthe few truly original and novel ideas of which the nineteenth century\r\ncan boast.\r\n\r\nPerraudin announced his idea to the greatest scientist in his little\r\nworld--Jean de Charpentier, director of the mines at Bex, a skilled\r\ngeologist who had been a fellow-pupil of Von Buch and Von Humboldt\r\nunder Werner at the Freiberg School of Mines. Charpentier laughed at\r\nthe mountaineer's grotesque idea, and thought no more about it. And ten\r\nyears elapsed before Perraudin could find any one who treated his notion\r\nwith greater respect. Then he found a listener in M. Venetz, a civil\r\nengineer, who read a paper on the novel glacial theory before a local\r\nsociety in 1823. This brought the matter once more to the attention of\r\nDe Charpentier, who now felt that there might be something in it worth\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nA survey of the field in the light of the new theory soon convinced\r\nCharpentier that the chamois-hunter had all along been right. He became\r\nan enthusiastic supporter of the idea that the Alps had once been\r\nimbedded in a mass of ice, and in 1836 he brought the notion to the\r\nattention of Louis Agassiz, who was spending the summer in the Alps.\r\nAgassiz was sceptical at first, but soon became a convert.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 Agassiz published a paper in which the results of his Alpine\r\nstudies were elaborated.\r\n\r\n\"Let us consider,\" he says, \"those more considerable changes to which\r\nglaciers are subject, or rather, the immense extent which they had in\r\nthe prehistoric period. This former immense extension, greater than any\r\nthat tradition has preserved, is proved, in the case of nearly every\r\nvalley in the Alps, by facts which are both many and well established.\r\nThe study of these facts is even easy if the student is looking out for\r\nthem, and if he will seize the least indication of their presence; and,\r\nif it were a long time before they were observed and connected with\r\nglacial action, it is because the evidences are often isolated and occur\r\nat places more or less removed from the glacier which originated them.\r\nIf it be true that it is the prerogative of the scientific observer to\r\ngroup in the field of his mental vision those facts which appear to be\r\nwithout connection to the vulgar herd, it is, above all, in such a case\r\nas this that he is called upon to do so. I have often compared these\r\nfeeble effects, produced by the glacial action of former ages, with the\r\nappearance of the markings upon a lithographic stone, prepared for the\r\npurpose of preservation, and upon which one cannot see the lines of the\r\ndraughtsman's work unless it is known beforehand where and how to search\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\n\"The fact of the former existence of glaciers which have now disappeared\r\nis proved by the survival of the various phenomena which always\r\naccompany them, and which continue to exist even after the ice has\r\nmelted. These phenomena are as follows:\r\n\r\n\"1. Moraines.--The disposition and composition of moraines enable them\r\nto be always recognized, even when they are no longer adjacent to a\r\nglacier nor immediately surround its lower extremities. I may remark\r\nthat lateral and terminal moraines alone enable us to recognize with\r\ncertainty the limits of glacial extension, because they can be easily\r\ndistinguished from the dikes and irregularly distributed stones carried\r\ndown by the Alpine torrents, The lateral moraines deposited upon the\r\nsides of valleys are rarely affected by the larger torrents, but they\r\nare, however, often cut by the small streams which fall down the side of\r\na mountain, and which, by interfering with their continuity, make them\r\nso much more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\"2. The Perched Bowlders.--It often happens that glaciers encounter\r\nprojecting points of rock, the sides of which become rounded, and around\r\nwhich funnel-like cavities are formed with more or less profundity. When\r\nglaciers diminish and retire, the blocks which have fallen into these\r\nfunnels often remain perched upon the top of the projecting rocky point\r\nwithin it, in such a state of equilibrium that any idea of a current of\r\nwater as the cause of their transportation is completely inadmissible\r\non account of their position. When such points of rock project above\r\nthe surface of the glacier or appear as a more considerable islet in\r\nthe midst of its mass (such as is the case in the Jardin of the Mer de\r\nGlace, above Montavert), such projections become surrounded on all\r\nsides by stones which ultimately form a sort of crown around the summit\r\nwhenever the glaciers decrease or retire completely. Water currents\r\nnever produce anything like this; but, on the contrary, whenever a\r\nstream breaks itself against a projecting rock, the stones which it\r\ncarries down are turned aside and form a more or less regular trail.\r\nNever, under such circumstances, can the stones remain either at the\r\ntop or at the sides of the rock, for, if such a thing were possible,\r\nthe rapidity of the current would be accelerated by the increased\r\nresistance, and the moving bowlders would be carried beyond the\r\nobstruction before they were finally deposited.\r\n\r\n\"3. The polished and striated rocks, such as have been described in\r\nChapter XIV., afford yet further evidence of the presence of a glacier;\r\nfor, as has been said already, neither a current nor the action of waves\r\nupon an extensive beach produces such effects. The general direction of\r\nthe channels and furrows indicates the direction of the general movement\r\nof the glacier, and the streaks which vary more or less from this\r\ndirection are produced by the local effects of oscillation and retreat,\r\nas we shall presently see.\r\n\r\n\"4. The Lapiaz, or Lapiz, which the inhabitants of German Switzerland\r\ncall Karrenfelder, cannot always be distinguished from erosions,\r\nbecause, both produced as they are by water, they do not differ in their\r\nexterior characteristics, but only in their positions. Erosions due to\r\ntorrents are always found in places more or less depressed, and never\r\noccur upon large inclined surfaces. The Lapiaz, on the contrary, are\r\nfrequently found upon the projecting parts of the sides of valleys in\r\nplaces where it is not possible to suppose that water has ever formed\r\na current. Some geologists, in their embarrassment to explain these\r\nphenomena, have supposed that they were due to the infiltration of\r\nacidulated water, but this hypothesis is purely gratuitous.\r\n\r\n\"We will now describe the remains of these various phenomena as they are\r\nfound in the Alps outside the actual glacial limits, in order to prove\r\nthat at a certain epoch glaciers were much larger than they are to-day.\r\n\r\n\"The ancient moraines, situated as they are at a great distance from\r\nthose of the present day, are nowhere so distinct or so frequent as\r\nin Valais, where MM. Venetz and J. de Charpentier noticed them for the\r\nfirst time; but as their observations are as yet unpublished, and they\r\nthemselves gave me the information, it would be an appropriation of\r\ntheir discovery if I were to describe them here in detail. I will limit\r\nmyself to say that there can be found traces, more or less distinct, of\r\nancient terminal moraines in the form of vaulted dikes at the foot of\r\nevery glacier, at a distance of a few minutes' walk, a quarter of an\r\nhour, a half-hour, an hour, and even of several leagues from their\r\npresent extremities. These traces become less distinct in proportion\r\nto their distance from the glacier, and, since they are also often\r\ntraversed by torrents, they are not as continuous as the moraines which\r\nare nearer to the glaciers. The farther these ancient moraines are\r\nremoved from the termination of a glacier, the higher up they reach upon\r\nthe sides of the valley, which proves to us that the thickness of the\r\nglacier must have been greater when its size was larger. At the same\r\ntime, their number indicates so many stopping-places in the retreat of\r\nthe glacier, or so many extreme limits of its extension--limits which\r\nwere never reached again after it had retired. I insist upon this point,\r\nbecause if it is true that all these moraines demonstrate a larger\r\nextent of the glacier, they also prove that their retreat into their\r\npresent boundaries, far from having been catastrophic, was marked on the\r\ncontrary by periods of repose more or less frequent, which caused the\r\nformation of a series of concentric moraines which even now indicate\r\ntheir retrogression.\r\n\r\n\"The remains of longitudinal moraines are less frequent, less distinct,\r\nand more difficult to investigate, because, indicating as they do the\r\nlevels to which the edges of the glacier reached at different epochs,\r\nit is generally necessary to look for them above the line of the\r\npaths along the escarpments of the valleys, and hence it is not always\r\npossible to follow them along a valley. Often, also, the sides of a\r\nvalley which enclosed a glacier are so steep that it is only here and\r\nthere that the stones have remained in place. They are, nevertheless,\r\nvery distinct in the lower part of the valley of the Rhone, between\r\nMartigny and the Lake of Geneva, where several parallel ridges can be\r\nobserved, one above the other, at a height of one thousand, one thousand\r\ntwo hundred, and even one thousand five hundred feet above the Rhone.\r\nIt is between St. Maurice and the cascade of Pissevache, close to the\r\nhamlet of Chaux-Fleurie, that they are most accessible, for at this\r\nplace the sides of the valley at different levels ascend in little\r\nterraces, upon which the moraines have been preserved. They are also\r\nvery distinct above the Bains de Lavey, and above the village of Monthey\r\nat the entrance of the Val d'Illiers, where the sides of the valley are\r\nless inclined than in many other places.\r\n\r\n\"The perched bowlders which are found in the Alpine valleys, at\r\nconsiderable distances from the glaciers, occupy at times positions so\r\nextraordinary that they excite in a high degree the curiosity of those\r\nwho see them. For instance, when one sees an angular stone perched upon\r\nthe top of an isolated pyramid, or resting in some way in a very steep\r\nlocality, the first inquiry of the mind is, When and how have these\r\nstones been placed in such positions, where the least shock would seem\r\nto turn them over? But this phenomenon is not in the least astonishing\r\nwhen it is seen to occur also within the limits of actual glaciers, and\r\nit is recalled by what circumstances it is occasioned.\r\n\r\n\"The most curious examples of perched stones which can be cited are\r\nthose which command the northern part of the cascade of Pissevache,\r\nclose to Chaux-Fleurie, and those above the Bains de Lavey, close to the\r\nvillage of Morcles; and those, even more curious, which I have seen in\r\nthe valley of St. Nicolas and Oberhasli. At Kirchet, near Meiringen, can\r\nbe seen some very remarkable crowns of bowlders around several domes\r\nof rock which appear to have been projected above the surface of the\r\nglacier which surrounded them. Something very similar can be seen around\r\nthe top of the rock of St. Triphon.\r\n\r\n\"The extraordinary phenomenon of perched stones could not escape the\r\nobserving eye of De Saussure, who noticed several at Saleve, of which\r\nhe described the positions in the following manner: 'One sees,' said he,\r\n'upon the slope of an inclined meadow, two of these great bowlders of\r\ngranite, elevated one upon the other, above the grass at a height of two\r\nor three feet, upon a base of limestone rock on which both rest. This\r\nbase is a continuation of the horizontal strata of the mountain, and is\r\neven united with it visibly on its lower face, being cut perpendicularly\r\nupon the other sides, and is not larger than the stone which it\r\nsupports.' But seeing that the entire mountain is composed of the same\r\nlimestone, De Saussure naturally concluded that it would be absurd to\r\nthink that it was elevated precisely and only beneath the blocks of\r\ngranite. But, on the other hand, since he did not know the manner in\r\nwhich these perched stones are deposited in our days by glacial action,\r\nhe had recourse to another explanation: He supposes that the rock was\r\nworn away around its base by the continual erosion of water and air,\r\nwhile the portion of the rock which served as the base for the granite\r\nhad been protected by it. This explanation, although very ingenious,\r\ncould no longer be admitted after the researches of M. Elie de Beaumont\r\nhad proved that the action of atmospheric agencies was not by a good\r\ndeal so destructive as was theretofore supposed. De Saussure speaks\r\nalso of a detached bowlder, situated upon the opposite side of the\r\nTete-Noire, 'which is,' he says, 'of so great a size that one is tempted\r\nto believe that it was formed in the place it occupies; and it is called\r\nBarme russe, because it is worn away beneath in the form of a cave which\r\ncan afford accommodation for more than thirty persons at a time.\"(4)\r\n\r\nBut the implications of the theory of glaciers extend, so Agassiz has\r\ncome to believe, far beyond the Alps. If the Alps had been covered with\r\nan ice sheet, so had many other regions of the northern hemisphere.\r\nCasting abroad for evidences of glacial action, Agassiz found them\r\neverywhere in the form of transported erratics, scratched and polished\r\noutcropping rocks, and moraine-like deposits. Finally, he became\r\nconvinced that the ice sheet that covered the Alps had spread over the\r\nwhole of the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere, forming an\r\nice cap over the globe. Thus the common-sense induction of the\r\nchamois-hunter blossomed in the mind of Agassiz into the conception of a\r\nuniversal ice age.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Agassiz had introduced his theory to the world, in a paper read\r\nat Neuchatel, and three years later he published his famous Etudes sur\r\nles Glaciers, from which we have just quoted. Never did idea make a more\r\nprofound disturbance in the scientific world. Von Buch treated it\r\nwith alternate ridicule, contempt, and rage; Murchison opposed it with\r\ncustomary vigor; even Lyell, whose most remarkable mental endowment was\r\nan unfailing receptiveness to new truths, could not at once discard\r\nhis iceberg theory in favor of the new claimant. Dr. Buckland, however,\r\nafter Agassiz had shown him evidence of former glacial action in his own\r\nScotland, became a convert--the more readily, perhaps, as it seemed to\r\nhim to oppose the uniformitarian idea. Gradually others fell in line,\r\nand after the usual imbittered controversy and the inevitable full\r\ngeneration of probation, the idea of an ice age took its place among\r\nthe accepted tenets of geology. All manner of moot points still demanded\r\nattention--the cause of the ice age, the exact extent of the ice sheet,\r\nthe precise manner in which it produced its effects, and the exact\r\nnature of these effects; and not all of these have even yet been\r\ndetermined. But, details aside, the ice age now has full recognition\r\nfrom geologists as an historical period. There may have been many ice\r\nages, as Dr. Croll contends; there was surely one; and the conception\r\nof such a period is one of the very few ideas of our century that no\r\nprevious century had even so much as faintly adumbrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL AGES\r\n\r\nBut, for that matter, the entire subject of historical geology is\r\none that had but the barest beginning before our century. Until the\r\npaleontologist found out the key to the earth's chronology, no one--not\r\neven Hutton--could have any definite idea as to the true story of the\r\nearth's past. The only conspicuous attempt to classify the strata was\r\nthat made by Werner, who divided the rocks into three systems, based on\r\ntheir supposed order of deposition, and called primary, transition, and\r\nsecondary.\r\n\r\nThough Werner's observations were confined to the small province of\r\nSaxony, he did not hesitate to affirm that all over the world the\r\nsuccession of strata would be found the same as there, the concentric\r\nlayers, according to this conception, being arranged about the earth\r\nwith the regularity of layers on an onion. But in this Werner was\r\nas mistaken as in his theoretical explanation of the origin of the\r\n\"primary\" rocks. It required but little observation to show that the\r\nexact succession of strata is never precisely the same in any widely\r\nseparated regions. Nevertheless, there was a germ of truth in Werner's\r\nsystem. It contained the idea, however faultily interpreted, of a\r\nchronological succession of strata; and it furnished a working outline\r\nfor the observers who were to make out the true story of geological\r\ndevelopment. But the correct interpretation of the observed facts could\r\nonly be made after the Huttonian view as to the origin of strata had\r\ngained complete acceptance.\r\n\r\nWhen William Smith, having found the true key to this story, attempted\r\nto apply it, the territory with which he had to deal chanced to be one\r\nwhere the surface rocks are of that later series which Werner termed\r\nsecondary. He made numerous subdivisions within this system, based\r\nmainly on the fossils. Meantime it was found that, judged by the\r\nfossils, the strata that Brongniart and Cuvier studied near Paris were\r\nof a still more recent period (presumed at first to be due to the latest\r\ndeluge), which came to be spoken of as tertiary. It was in these beds,\r\nsome of which seemed to have been formed in fresh-water lakes, that many\r\nof the strange mammals which Cuvier first described were found.\r\n\r\nBut the \"transition\" rocks, underlying the \"secondary\" system that Smith\r\nstudied, were still practically unexplored when, along in the thirties,\r\nthey were taken in hand by Roderick Impey Murchison, the reformed\r\nfox-hunter and ex-captain, who had turned geologist to such notable\r\nadvantage, and Adam Sedgwick, the brilliant Woodwardian professor at\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nWorking together, these two friends classified the\r\n\r\ntransition rocks into chronological groups, since familiar to every one\r\nin the larger outlines as the Silurian system (age of invertebrates) and\r\nthe Devonian system (age of fishes)--names derived respectively from the\r\ncountry of the ancient Silures, in Wales and Devonshire, England. It\r\nwas subsequently discovered that these systems of strata, which crop out\r\nfrom beneath newer rocks in restricted areas in Britain, are spread out\r\ninto broad, undisturbed sheets over thousands of miles in continental\r\nEurope and in America. Later on Murchison studied them in Russia,\r\nand described them, conjointly with Verneuil and Von Kerserling, in\r\na ponderous and classical work. In America they were studied by Hall,\r\nNewberry, Whitney, Dana, Whitfield, and other pioneer geologists, who\r\nall but anticipated their English contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe rocks that are of still older formation than those studied by\r\nMurchison and Sedgwick (corresponding in location to the \"primary\" rocks\r\nof Werner's conception) are the surface feature of vast areas in Canada,\r\nand were first prominently studied there by William I. Logan, of the\r\nCanadian Government Survey, as early as 1846, and later on by Sir\r\nWilliam Dawson. These rocks--comprising the Laurentian system--were\r\nformerly supposed to represent parts of the original crust of the earth,\r\nformed on first cooling from a molten state; but they are now more\r\ngenerally regarded as once-stratified deposits metamorphosed by the\r\naction of heat.\r\n\r\nWhether \"primitive\" or metamorphic, however, these Canadian rocks, and\r\nanalogous ones beneath the fossiliferous strata of other countries,\r\nare the oldest portions of the earth's crust of which geology has any\r\npresent knowledge. Mountains of this formation, as the Adirondacks and\r\nthe Storm King range, overlooking the Hudson near West Point, are the\r\npatriarchs of their kind, beside which Alleghanies and Sierra Nevadas\r\nare recent upstarts, and Rockies, Alps, and Andes are mere parvenus of\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks were at first spoken of as representing \"Azoic\"\r\ntime; but in 1846 Dawson found a formation deep in their midst which was\r\nbelieved to b e the fossil relic of a very low form of life, and after\r\nthat it became customary to speak of the system as \"Eozoic.\" Still more\r\nrecently the title of Dawson's supposed fossil to rank as such has been\r\nquestioned, and Dana's suggestion that the early rocks be termed merely\r\nArchman has met with general favor. Murchison and Sedgwick's Silurian,\r\nDevonian, and Carboniferous groups (the ages of invertebrates, of\r\nfishes, and of coal plants, respectively) are together spoken of as\r\nrepresenting Paleozoic time. William Smith's system of strata, next\r\nabove these, once called \"secondary,\" represents Mesozoic time, or\r\nthe age of reptiles. Still higher, or more recent, are Cuvier and\r\nBrongniart's tertiary rocks, representing the age of mammals. Lastly,\r\nthe most recent formations, dating back, however, to a period far enough\r\nfrom recent in any but a geological sense, are classed as quaternary,\r\nrepresenting the age of man.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that the successive \"ages\" of the\r\ngeologist are shut off from one another in any such arbitrary way as\r\nthis verbal classification might seem to suggest. In point of fact,\r\nthese \"ages\" have no better warrant for existence than have the\r\n\"centuries\" and the \"weeks\" of every-day computation. They are\r\nconvenient, and they may even stand for local divisions in the strata,\r\nbut they are bounded by no actual gaps in the sweep of terrestrial\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it must be understood that the \"ages\" of different continents,\r\nthough described under the same name, are not necessarily of exact\r\ncontemporaneity. There is no sure test available by which it could be\r\nshown that the Devonian age, for instance, as outlined in the strata of\r\nEurope, did not begin millions of years earlier or later than the period\r\nwhose records are said to represent the Devonian age in America. In\r\nattempting to decide such details as this, mineralogical data fail us\r\nutterly. Even in rocks of adjoining regions identity of structure is no\r\nproof of contemporaneous origin; for the veritable substance of the\r\nrock of one age is ground up to build the rocks of subsequent ages.\r\nFurthermore, in seas where conditions change but little the same form\r\nof rock may be made age after age. It is believed that chalk-beds still\r\nforming in some of our present seas may form one continuous mass dating\r\nback to earliest geologic ages. On the other hand, rocks different in\r\ncharacter maybe formed at the same time in regions not far apart--say\r\na sandstone along shore, a coral limestone farther seaward, and a\r\nchalk-bed beyond. This continuous stratum, broken in the process of\r\nupheaval, might seem the record of three different epochs.\r\n\r\nPaleontology, of course, supplies far better chronological tests, but\r\neven these have their limitations. There has been no time since rocks\r\nnow in existence were formed, if ever, when the earth had a uniform\r\nclimate and a single undiversified fauna over its entire land surface,\r\nas the early paleontologists supposed. Speaking broadly, the same\r\ngeneral stages have attended the evolution of organic forms everywhere,\r\nbut there is nothing to show that equal periods of time witnessed\r\ncorresponding changes in diverse regions, but quite the contrary.\r\nTo cite but a single illustration, the marsupial order, which is the\r\ndominant mammalian type of the living fauna of Australia to-day,\r\nexisted in Europe and died out there in the tertiary age. Hence a future\r\ngeologist might think the Australia of to-day contemporaneous with a\r\nperiod in Europe which in reality antedated it by perhaps millions of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAll these puzzling features unite to render the subject of historical\r\ngeology anything but the simple matter the fathers of the science\r\nesteemed it. No one would now attempt to trace the exact sequence of\r\nformation of all the mountains of the globe, as Elie de Beaumont did\r\na half-century ago. Even within the limits of a single continent, the\r\ngeologist must proceed with much caution in attempting to chronicle the\r\norder in which its various parts rose from the matrix of the sea. The\r\nkey to this story is found in the identification of the strata that\r\nare the surface feature in each territory. If Devonian rocks are at\r\nthe surface in any given region, for example, it would appear that this\r\nregion became a land surface in the Devonian age, or just afterwards.\r\nBut a moment's consideration shows that there is an element of\r\nuncertainty about this, due to the steady denudation that all land\r\nsurfaces undergo. The Devonian rocks may lie at the surface simply\r\nbecause the thousands of feet of carboniferous strata that once lay\r\nabove them have been worn away. All that the cautious geologist dare\r\nassert, therefore, is that the region in question did not become\r\npermanent land surface earlier than the Devonian age.\r\n\r\nBut to know even this is much--sufficient, indeed, to establish the\r\nchronological order of elevation, if not its exact period, for all parts\r\nof any continent that have been geologically explored--understanding\r\nalways that there must be no scrupling about a latitude of a few\r\nmillions or perhaps tens of millions of years here and there.\r\n\r\nRegarding our own continent, for example, we learn through the\r\nresearches of a multitude of workers that in the early day it was a mere\r\narchipelago. Its chief island--the backbone of the future continent--was\r\na great V-shaped area surrounding what is now Hudson Bay, an area built\r\ntip, perhaps, through denudation of a yet more ancient polar continent,\r\nwhose existence is only conjectured. To the southeast an island that\r\nis now the Adirondack Mountains, and another that is now the Jersey\r\nHighlands rose above the waste of waters, and far to the south stretched\r\nprobably a line of islands now represented by the Blue Ridge Mountains.\r\nFar off to the westward another line of islands foreshadowed our present\r\nPacific border. A few minor islands in the interior completed the\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\nFrom this bare skeleton the continent grew, partly by the deposit of\r\nsediment from the denudation of the original islands (which once towered\r\nmiles, perhaps, where now they rise thousands of feet), but largely also\r\nby the deposit of organic remains, especially in the interior sea, which\r\nteemed with life. In the Silurian ages, invertebrates--brachiopods and\r\ncrinoids and cephalopods--were the dominant types. But very early--no\r\none knows just when--there came fishes of many strange forms, some of\r\nthe early ones enclosed in turtle-like shells. Later yet, large spaces\r\nwithin the interior sea having risen to the surface, great marshes or\r\nforests of strange types of vegetation grew and deposited their remains\r\nto form coal-beds. Many times over such forests were formed, only to be\r\ndestroyed by the oscillations of the land surface. All told, the strata\r\nof this Paleozoic period aggregate several miles in thickness, and the\r\ntime consumed in their formation stands to all later time up to the\r\npresent, according to Professor Dana's estimate, as three to one.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this Paleozoic era the Appalachian Mountains\r\nwere slowly upheaved in great convoluted folds, some of them probably\r\nreaching three or four miles above the sea-level, though the tooth\r\nof time has since gnawed them down to comparatively puny limits. The\r\ncontinental areas thus enlarged were peopled during the ensuing Mesozoic\r\ntime with multitudes of strange reptiles, many of them gigantic in size.\r\nThe waters, too, still teeming with invertebrates and fishes, had their\r\nquota of reptilian monsters; and in the air were flying reptiles, some\r\nof which measured twenty-five feet from tip to tip of their batlike\r\nwings. During this era the Sierra Nevada Mountains rose. Near the\r\neastern border of the forming continent the strata were perhaps now too\r\nthick and stiff to bend into mountain folds, for they were rent into\r\ngreat fissures, letting out floods of molten lava, remnants of which are\r\nstill in evidence after ages of denudation, as the Palisades along the\r\nHudson, and such elevations as Mount Holyoke in western Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nStill there remained a vast interior sea, which later on, in the\r\ntertiary age, was to be divided by the slow uprising of the land, which\r\nonly yesterday--that is to say, a million, or three or five or ten\r\nmillion, years ago--became the Rocky Mountains. High and erect these\r\nyoung mountains stand to this day, their sharp angles and rocky contours\r\nvouching for their youth, in strange contrast with the shrunken forms\r\nof the old Adirondacks, Green Mountains, and Appalachians, whose lowered\r\nheads and rounded shoulders attest the weight of ages. In the vast lakes\r\nwhich still remained on either side of the Rocky range, tertiary\r\nstrata were slowly formed to the ultimate depth of two or three miles,\r\nenclosing here and there those vertebrate remains which were to be\r\nexposed again to view by denudation when the land rose still higher,\r\nand then, in our own time, to tell so wonderful a story to the\r\npaleontologist.\r\n\r\nFinally, the interior seas were filled, and the shore lines of the\r\ncontinent assumed nearly their present outline.\r\n\r\nThen came the long winter of the glacial epoch--perhaps of a succession\r\nof glacial epochs. The ice sheet extended southward to about the\r\nfortieth parallel, driving some animals before it, and destroying those\r\nthat were unable to migrate. At its fulness, the great ice mass lay\r\nalmost a mile in depth over New England, as attested by the scratched\r\nand polished rock surfaces and deposited erratics in the White\r\nMountains. Such a mass presses down with a weight of about one hundred\r\nand twenty-five tons to the square foot, according to Dr. Croll's\r\nestimate. It crushed and ground everything beneath it more or less, and\r\nin some regions planed off hilly surfaces into prairies. Creeping slowly\r\nforward, it carried all manner of debris with it. When it melted away\r\nits terminal moraine built up the nucleus of the land masses now known\r\nas Long Island and Staten Island; other of its deposits formed the\r\n\"drumlins\" about Boston famous as Bunker and Breed's hills; and it left\r\na long, irregular line of ridges of \"till\" or bowlder clay and scattered\r\nerratics clear across the country at about the latitude of New York\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nAs the ice sheet slowly receded it left minor moraines all along its\r\ncourse. Sometimes its deposits dammed up river courses or inequalities\r\nin the surface, to form the lakes which everywhere abound over Northern\r\nterritories. Some glacialists even hold the view first suggested by\r\nRamsey, of the British Geological Survey, that the great glacial sheets\r\nscooped out the basins of many lakes, including the system that feeds\r\nthe St. Lawrence. At all events, it left traces of its presence all\r\nalong the line of its retreat, and its remnants exist to this day as\r\nmountain glaciers and the polar ice cap. Indeed, we live on the border\r\nof the last glacial epoch, for with the closing of this period the long\r\ngeologic past merges into the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE\r\n\r\nAnd the present, no less than the past, is a time of change. This is the\r\nthought which James Hutton conceived more than a century ago, but which\r\nhis contemporaries and successors were so very slow to appreciate. Now,\r\nhowever, it has become axiomatic--one can hardly realize that it was\r\never doubted. Every new scientific truth, says Agassiz, must pass\r\nthrough three stages--first, men say it is not true; then they declare\r\nit hostile to religion; finally, they assert that every one has known\r\nit always. Hutton's truth that natural law is changeless and eternal\r\nhas reached this final stage. Nowhere now could you find a scientist\r\nwho would dispute the truth of that text which Lyell, quoting from\r\nPlayfair's Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory, printed on the\r\ntitle-page of his Principles: \"Amid all the revolutions of the globe\r\nthe economy of Nature has been uniform, and her laws are the only things\r\nthat have resisted the general movement. The rivers and the rocks, the\r\nseas and the continents, have been changed in all their parts; but\r\nthe laws which direct those changes, and the rules to which they are\r\nsubject, have remained invariably the same.\"\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, Hutton and Playfair, and in particular Lyell,\r\ndrew inferences from this principle which the modern physicist can by no\r\nmeans admit. To them it implied that the changes on the surface of the\r\nearth have always been the same in degree as well as in kind, and must\r\nso continue while present forces hold their sway. In other words, they\r\nthought of the world as a great perpetual-motion machine. But the\r\nmodern physicist, given truer mechanical insight by the doctrines of the\r\nconservation and the dissipation of energy, will have none of that. Lord\r\nKelvin, in particular, has urged that in the periods of our earth's in\r\nfancy and adolescence its developmental changes must have been, like\r\nthose of any other infant organism, vastly more rapid and pronounced\r\nthan those of a later day; and to every clear thinker this truth also\r\nmust now seem axiomatic.\r\n\r\nWhoever thinks of the earth as a cooling globe can hardly doubt that its\r\ncrust, when thinner, may have heaved under strain of the moon's tidal\r\npull--whether or not that body was nearer--into great billows, daily\r\nrising and falling, like waves of the present seas vastly magnified.\r\n\r\nUnder stress of that same lateral pressure from contraction which now\r\nproduces the slow depression of the Jersey coast, the slow rise of\r\nSweden, the occasional belching of an insignificant volcano, the jetting\r\nof a geyser, or the trembling of an earthquake, once large areas were\r\nrent in twain, and vast floods of lava flowed over thousands of square\r\nmiles of the earth's surface, perhaps, at a single jet; and, for aught\r\nwe know to the contrary, gigantic mountains may have heaped up their\r\ncontorted heads in cataclysms as spasmodic as even the most ardent\r\ncatastrophist of the elder day of geology could have imagined.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of that early day, filled with vast volumes of carbon,\r\noxygen, and other chemicals that have since been stored in beds of coal,\r\nlimestone, and granites, may have worn down the rocks on the one hand\r\nand built up organic forms on the other, with a rapidity that would now\r\nseem hardly conceivable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet while all these anomalous things went on, the same laws held\r\nsway that now are operative; and a true doctrine of uniformitarianism\r\nwould make no unwonted concession in conceding them all--though most of\r\nthe imbittered geological controversies of the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury were due to the failure of both parties to realize that simple\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nAnd as of the past and present, so of the future. The same forces will\r\ncontinue to operate; and under operation of these unchanging forces each\r\nday will differ from every one that has preceded it. If it be true,\r\nas every physicist believes, that the earth is a cooling globe, then,\r\nwhatever its present stage of refrigeration, the time must come when its\r\nsurface contour will assume a rigidity of level not yet attained. Then,\r\njust as surely, the slow action of the elements will continue to wear\r\naway the land surfaces, particle by particle, and transport them to the\r\nocean, as it does to-day, until, compensation no longer being afforded\r\nby the upheaval of the continents, the last foot of dry land will sink\r\nfor the last time beneath the water, the last mountain-peak melting\r\naway, and our globe, lapsing like any other organism into its second\r\nchildhood, will be on the surface--as presumably it was before the first\r\ncontinent rose--one vast \"waste of waters.\" As puny man conceives time\r\nand things, an awful cycle will have lapsed; in the sweep of the cosmic\r\nlife, a pulse-beat will have throbbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE NEW SCIENCE OF METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORITES\r\n\r\n\"An astonishing miracle has just occurred in our district,\" wrote M.\r\nMarais, a worthy if undistinguished citizen of France, from his home at\r\nL'Aigle, under date of \"the 13th Floreal, year 11\"--a date which outside\r\nof France would be interpreted as meaning May 3, 1803. This \"miracle\"\r\nwas the appearance of a \"fireball\" in broad daylight--\"perhaps it was\r\nwildfire,\" says the naive chronicle--which \"hung over the meadow,\" being\r\nseen by many people, and then exploded with a loud sound, scattering\r\nthousands of stony fragments over the surface of a territory some miles\r\nin extent.\r\n\r\nSuch a \"miracle\" could not have been announced at a more opportune time.\r\nFor some years the scientific world had been agog over the question\r\nwhether such a form of lightning as that reported--appearing in a clear\r\nsky, and hurling literal thunderbolts--had real existence. Such\r\ncases had been reported often enough, it is true. The \"thunderbolts\"\r\nthemselves were exhibited as sacred relics before many an altar, and\r\nthose who doubted their authenticity had been chided as having \"an\r\nevil heart of unbelief.\" But scientific scepticism had questioned the\r\nevidence, and late in the eighteenth century a consensus of opinion\r\nin the French Academy had declined to admit that such stones had been\r\n\"conveyed to the earth by lightning,\" let alone any more miraculous\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, however, Edward Howard had read a paper before the Royal\r\nSociety in which, after reviewing the evidence recently put forward,\r\nhe had reached the conclusion that the fall of stones from the sky,\r\nsometimes or always accompanied by lightning, must be admitted as\r\nan actual phenomenon, however inexplicable. So now, when the great\r\nstone-fall at L'Aigle was announced, the French Academy made haste to\r\nsend the brilliant young physicist Jean Baptiste Biot to investigate\r\nit, that the matter might, if possible, be set finally at rest.\r\nThe investigation was in all respects successful, and Biot's report\r\ntransferred the stony or metallic lightning-bolt--the aerolite or\r\nmeteorite--from the realm of tradition and conjecture to that of\r\naccepted science.\r\n\r\nBut how explain this strange phenomenon? At once speculation was rife.\r\nOne theory contended that the stony masses had not actually fallen, but\r\nhad been formed from the earth by the action of the lightning; but this\r\ncontention was early abandoned. The chemists were disposed to believe\r\nthat the aerolites had been formed by the combination of elements\r\nfloating in the upper atmosphere. Geologists, on the other hand, thought\r\nthem of terrestrial origin, urging that they might have been thrown up\r\nby volcanoes. The astronomers, as represented by Olbers and Laplace,\r\nmodified this theory by suggesting that the stones might, indeed, have\r\nbeen cast out by volcanoes, but by volcanoes situated not on the earth,\r\nbut on the moon.\r\n\r\nAnd one speculator of the time took a step even more daring, urging that\r\nthe aerolites were neither of telluric nor selenitic origin, nor yet\r\nchildren of the sun, as the old Greeks had, many of them, contended,\r\nbut that they are visitants from the depths of cosmic space. This bold\r\nspeculator was the distinguished German physicist Ernst F. F. Chladni,\r\na man of no small repute in his day. As early as 1794 he urged his\r\ncosmical theory of meteorites, when the very existence of meteorites was\r\ndenied by most scientists. And he did more: he declared his belief\r\nthat these falling stones were really one in origin and kind with those\r\nflashing meteors of the upper atmosphere which are familiar everywhere\r\nas \"shooting-stars.\"\r\n\r\nEach of these coruscating meteors, he affirmed, must tell of the\r\nignition of a bit of cosmic matter entering the earth's atmosphere. Such\r\nwandering bits of matter might be the fragments of shattered worlds, or,\r\nas Chladni thought more probable, merely aggregations of \"world stuff\"\r\nnever hitherto connected with any large planetary mass.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, so unique a view met with very scant favor.\r\nAstronomers at that time saw little to justify it; and the\r\nnon-scientific world rejected it with fervor as being \"atheistic and\r\nheretical,\" because its acceptance would seem to imply that the universe\r\nis not a perfect mechanism.\r\n\r\nSome light was thrown on the moot point presently by the observations of\r\nBrandes and Benzenberg, which tended to show that falling-stars travel\r\nat an actual speed of from fifteen to ninety miles a second. This\r\nobservation tended to discredit the selenitic theory, since an object,\r\nin order to acquire such speed in falling merely from the moon, must\r\nhave been projected with an initial velocity not conceivably to be given\r\nby any lunar volcanic impulse. Moreover, there was a growing conviction\r\nthat there are no active volcanoes on the moon, and other considerations\r\nof the same tenor led to the complete abandonment of the selenitic\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nBut the theory of telluric origin of aerolites was by no means so easily\r\ndisposed of. This was an epoch when electrical phenomena were exciting\r\nunbounded and universal interest, and there was a not unnatural tendency\r\nto appeal to electricity in explanation of every obscure phenomenon; and\r\nin this case the seeming similarity between a lightning flash and the\r\nflash of an aerolite lent color to the explanation. So we find Thomas\r\nForster, a meteorologist of repute, still adhering to the atmospheric\r\ntheory of formation of aerolites in his book published in 1823; and,\r\nindeed, the prevailing opinion of the time seemed divided between\r\nvarious telluric theories, to the neglect of any cosmical theory\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nBut in 1833 occurred a phenomenon which set the matter finally at\r\nrest. A great meteoric shower occurred in November of that year, and\r\nin observing it Professor Denison Olmstead, of Yale, noted that all\r\nthe stars of the shower appeared to come from a single centre or\r\nvanishing-point in the heavens, and that this centre shifted its\r\nposition with the stars, and hence was not telluric. The full\r\nsignificance of this observation was at once recognized by astronomers;\r\nit demonstrated beyond all cavil the cosmical origin of the\r\nshooting-stars. Some conservative meteorologists kept up the argument\r\nfor the telluric origin for some decades to come, as a matter of\r\ncourse--such a band trails always in the rear of progress. But even\r\nthese doubters were silenced when the great shower of shooting-stars\r\nappeared again in 1866, as predicted by Olbers and Newton, radiating\r\nfrom the same point of the heavens as before.\r\n\r\nSince then the spectroscope has added its confirmatory evidence as to\r\nthe identity of meteorite and shooting-star, and, moreover, has linked\r\nthese atmospheric meteors with such distant cosmic residents as comets\r\nand nebulae. Thus it appears that Chladni's daring hypothesis of\r\n1794 has been more than verified, and that the fragments of matter\r\ndissociated from planetary connection--which be postulated and was\r\ndeclared atheistic for postulating--have been shown to be billions\r\nof times more numerous than any larger cosmic bodies of which we have\r\ncognizance--so widely does the existing universe differ from man's\r\npreconceived notions as to what it should be.\r\n\r\nThus also the \"miracle\" of the falling stone, against which the\r\nscientific scepticism of yesterday presented \"an evil heart of\r\nunbelief,\" turns out to be the most natural phenomena, inasmuch as it is\r\nrepeated in our atmosphere some millions of times each day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS\r\n\r\nIf fire-balls were thought miraculous and portentous in days of yore,\r\nwhat interpretation must needs have been put upon that vastly more\r\npicturesque phenomenon, the aurora? \"Through all the city,\" says the\r\nBook of Maccabees, \"for the space of almost forty days, there were seen\r\nhorsemen running in the air, in cloth of gold, armed with lances, like\r\na band of soldiers: and troops of horsemen in array encountering and\r\nrunning one against another, with shaking of shields and multitude of\r\npikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, and glittering of\r\ngolden ornaments and harness.\" Dire omens these; and hardly less ominous\r\nthe aurora seemed to all succeeding generations that observed it down\r\nwell into the eighteenth century--as witness the popular excitement in\r\nEngland in 1716 over the brilliant aurora of that year, which became\r\nfamous through Halley's description.\r\n\r\nBut after 1752, when Franklin dethroned the lightning, all spectacular\r\nmeteors came to be regarded as natural phenomena, the aurora among the\r\nrest. Franklin explained the aurora--which was seen commonly enough in\r\nthe eighteenth century, though only recorded once in the seventeenth--as\r\ndue to the accumulation of electricity on the surface of polar snows,\r\nand its discharge to the equator through the upper atmosphere. Erasmus\r\nDarwin suggested that the luminosity might be due to the ignition of\r\nhydrogen, which was supposed by many philosophers to form the upper\r\natmosphere. Dalton, who first measured the height of the aurora,\r\nestimating it at about one hundred miles, thought the phenomenon due\r\nto magnetism acting on ferruginous particles in the air, and his\r\nexplanation was perhaps the most popular one at the beginning of the\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\nSince then a multitude of observers have studied the aurora, but the\r\nscientific grasp has found it as elusive in fact as it seems to casual\r\nobservation, and its exact nature is as undetermined to-day as it was a\r\nhundred years ago. There has been no dearth of theories concerning it,\r\nhowever. Blot, who studied it in the Shetland Islands in 1817, thought\r\nit due to electrified ferruginous dust, the origin of which he ascribed\r\nto Icelandic volcanoes. Much more recently the idea of ferruginous\r\nparticles has been revived, their presence being ascribed not to\r\nvolcanoes, but to the meteorites constantly being dissipated in the\r\nupper atmosphere. Ferruginous dust, presumably of such origin, has been\r\nfound on the polar snows, as well as on the snows of mountain-tops, but\r\nwhether it could produce the phenomena of auroras is at least an open\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOther theorists have explained the aurora as due to the accumulation of\r\nelectricity on clouds or on spicules of ice in the upper air. Yet others\r\nthink it due merely to the passage of electricity through rarefied air\r\nitself. Humboldt considered the matter settled in yet another way when\r\nFaraday showed, in 1831, that magnetism may produce luminous effects.\r\nBut perhaps the prevailing theory of to-day assumes that the aurora is\r\ndue to a current of electricity generated at the equator and passing\r\nthrough upper regions of space, to enter the earth at the magnetic\r\npoles--simply reversing the course which Franklin assumed.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the auroral light to that generated in a vacuum\r\nbulb by the passage of electricity lends support to the long-standing\r\nsupposition that the aurora is of electrical origin, but the subject\r\nstill awaits complete elucidation. For once even that mystery-solver the\r\nspectroscope has been baffled, for the line it sifts from the aurora is\r\nnot matched by that of any recognized substance. A like line is found\r\nin the zodiacal light, it is true, but this is of little aid, for the\r\nzodiacal light, though thought by some astronomers to be due to meteor\r\nswarms about the sun, is held to be, on the whole, as mysterious as the\r\naurora itself.\r\n\r\nWhatever the exact nature of the aurora, it has long been known to\r\nbe intimately associated with the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism.\r\nWhenever a brilliant aurora is visible, the world is sure to be visited\r\nwith what Humboldt called a magnetic storm--a \"storm\" which manifests\r\nitself to human senses in no way whatsoever except by deflecting the\r\nmagnetic needle and conjuring with the electric wire. Such magnetic\r\nstorms are curiously associated also with spots on the sun--just how no\r\none has explained, though the fact itself is unquestioned. Sun-spots,\r\ntoo, seem directly linked with auroras, each of these phenomena passing\r\nthrough periods of greatest and least frequency in corresponding cycles\r\nof about eleven years' duration.\r\n\r\nIt was suspected a full century ago by Herschel that the variations in\r\nthe number of sun-spots had a direct effect upon terrestrial weather,\r\nand he attempted to demonstrate it by using the price of wheat as a\r\ncriterion of climatic conditions, meantime making careful observation\r\nof the sun-spots. Nothing very definite came of his efforts in this\r\ndirection, the subject being far too complex to be determined without\r\nlong periods of observation. Latterly, however, meteorologists,\r\nparticularly in the tropics, are disposed to think they find evidence\r\nof some such connection between sun-spots and the weather as Herschel\r\nsuspected. Indeed, Mr. Meldrum declares that there is a positive\r\ncoincidence between periods of numerous sun-spots and seasons of\r\nexcessive rain in India.\r\n\r\nThat some such connection does exist seems intrinsically probable. But\r\nthe modern meteorologist, learning wisdom of the past, is extremely\r\ncautious about ascribing casual effects to astronomical phenomena.\r\nHe finds it hard to forget that until recently all manner of climatic\r\nconditions were associated with phases of the moon; that not so very\r\nlong ago showers of falling-stars were considered \"prognostic\" of\r\ncertain kinds of weather; and that the \"equinoctial storm\" had\r\nbeen accepted as a verity by every one, until the unfeeling hand of\r\nstatistics banished it from the earth.\r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand, it is easily within the possibilities that the\r\nscience of the future may reveal associations between the weather and\r\nsun-spots, auroras, and terrestrial magnetism that as yet are hardly\r\ndreamed of. Until such time, however, these phenomena must feel\r\nthemselves very grudgingly admitted to the inner circle of meteorology.\r\nMore and more this science concerns itself, in our age of concentration\r\nand specialization, with weather and climate. Its votaries no\r\nlonger concern themselves with stars or planets or comets or\r\nshooting-stars--once thought the very essence of guides to weather\r\nwisdom; and they are even looking askance at the moon, and asking her\r\nto show cause why she also should not be excluded from their domain.\r\nEqually little do they care for the interior of the earth, since they\r\nhave learned that the central emanations of heat which Mairan imagined\r\nas a main source of aerial warmth can claim no such distinction. Even\r\nsuch problems as why the magnetic pole does not coincide with the\r\ngeographical, and why the force of terrestrial magnetism decreases from\r\nthe magnetic poles to the magnetic equator, as Humboldt first discovered\r\nthat it does, excite them only to lukewarm interest; for magnetism,\r\nthey say, is not known to have any connection whatever with climate or\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVAPORATION, CLOUD FORMATION, AND DEW\r\n\r\nThere is at least one form of meteor, however, of those that interested\r\nour forebears whose meteorological importance they did not overestimate.\r\nThis is the vapor of water. How great was the interest in this familiar\r\nmeteor at the beginning of the century is attested by the number of\r\ntheories then extant regarding it; and these conflicting theories bear\r\nwitness also to the difficulty with which the familiar phenomenon of the\r\nevaporation of water was explained.\r\n\r\nFranklin had suggested that air dissolves water much as water dissolves\r\nsalt, and this theory was still popular, though Deluc had disproved it\r\nby showing that water evaporates even more rapidly in a vacuum than\r\nin air. Deluc's own theory, borrowed from earlier chemists, was that\r\nevaporation is the chemical union of particles of water with particles\r\nof the supposititious element heat. Erasmus Darwin combined the two\r\ntheories, suggesting that the air might hold a variable quantity of\r\nvapor in mere solution, and in addition a permanent moiety in chemical\r\ncombination with caloric.\r\n\r\nUndisturbed by these conflicting views, that strangely original\r\ngenius, John Dalton, afterwards to be known as perhaps the greatest\r\nof theoretical chemists, took the question in hand, and solved it by\r\nshowing that water exists in the air as an utterly independent gas. He\r\nreached a partial insight into the matter in 1793, when his first volume\r\nof meteorological essays was published; but the full elucidation of\r\nthe problem came to him in 1801. The merit of his studies was at once\r\nrecognized, but the tenability of his hypothesis was long and ardently\r\ndisputed.\r\n\r\nWhile the nature of evaporation was in dispute, as a matter of course\r\nthe question of precipitation must be equally undetermined. The most\r\nfamous theory of the period was that formulated by Dr. Hutton in a paper\r\nread before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and published in the volume\r\nof transactions which contained also the same author's epoch-making\r\npaper on geology. This \"theory of rain\" explained precipitation as due\r\nto the cooling of a current of saturated air by contact with a colder\r\ncurrent, the assumption being that the surplusage of moisture was\r\nprecipitated in a chemical sense, just as the excess of salt dissolved\r\nin hot water is precipitated when the water cools. The idea that the\r\ncooling of the saturated air causes the precipitation of its moisture\r\nis the germ of truth that renders this paper of Hutton's important. All\r\ncorrect later theories build on this foundation.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose the surface of this earth wholly covered with water,\"\r\nsaid Hutton, \"and that the sun were stationary, being always vertical in\r\none place; then, from the laws of heat and rarefaction, there would be\r\nformed a circulation in the atmosphere, flowing from the dark and cold\r\nhemisphere to the heated and illuminated place, in all directions,\r\ntowards the place of the greatest cold.\r\n\r\n\"As there is for the atmosphere of this earth a constant cooling cause,\r\nthis fluid body could only arrive at a certain degree of heat; and this\r\nwould be regularly decreasing from the centre of illumination to the\r\nopposite point of the globe, most distant from the light and heat.\r\nBetween these two regions of extreme heat and cold there would, in every\r\nplace, be found two streams of air following in opposite directions. If\r\nthose streams of air, therefore, shall be supposed as both sufficiently\r\nsaturated with humidity, then, as they are of different temperatures,\r\nthere would be formed a continual condensation of aqueous vapor, in some\r\nmiddle region of the atmosphere, by the commixtion of part of those two\r\nopposite streams.\r\n\r\n\"Hence there is reason to believe that in this supposed case there would\r\nbe formed upon the surface of the globe three different regions--the\r\ntorrid region, the temperate, and the frigid. These three regions would\r\ncontinue stationary; and the operations of each would be continual. In\r\nthe torrid region, nothing but evaporation and heat would take place;\r\nno cloud could be formed, because in changing the transparency of the\r\natmosphere to opacity it would be heated immediately by the operation of\r\nlight, and thus the condensed water would be again evaporated. But this\r\npower of the sun would have a termination; and it is these that would\r\nbegin the region of temperate heat and of continual rain. It is not\r\nprobable that the region of temperance would reach far beyond the region\r\nof light; and in the hemisphere of darkness there would be found a\r\nregion of extreme cold and perfect dryness.\r\n\r\n\"Let us now suppose the earth as turning on its axis in the equinoctial\r\nsituation. The torrid region would thus be changed into a zone, in\r\nwhich there would be night and day; consequently, here would be much\r\ntemperance, compared with the torrid region now considered; and here\r\nperhaps there would be formed periodical condensation and evaporation of\r\nhumidity, corresponding to the seasons of night and day. As temperance\r\nwould thus be introduced into the region of torrid extremity, so would\r\nthe effect of this change be felt over all the globe, every part of\r\nwhich would now be illuminated, consequently heated in some degree. Thus\r\nwe would have a line of great heat and evaporation, graduating each way\r\ninto a point of great cold and congelation. Between these two extremes\r\nof heat and cold there would be found in each hemisphere a region\r\nof much temperance, in relation to heat, but of much humidity in the\r\natmosphere, perhaps of continual rain and condensation.\r\n\r\n\"The supposition now formed must appear extremely unfit for making this\r\nglobe a habitable world in every part; but having thus seen the effect\r\nof night and day in temperating the effects of heat and cold in every\r\nplace, we are now prepared to contemplate the effects of supposing this\r\nglobe to revolve around the sun with a certain inclination of its axis.\r\nBy this beautiful contrivance, that comparatively uninhabited globe is\r\nnow divided into two hemispheres, each of which is thus provided with\r\na summer and a winter season. But our present view is limited to the\r\nevaporation and condensation of humidity; and, in this contrivance of\r\nthe seasons, there must appear an ample provision for those alternate\r\noperations in every part; for as the place of the vertical sun is moved\r\nalternately from one tropic to the other, heat and cold, the original\r\ncauses of evaporation and condensation, must be carried over all the\r\nglobe, producing either annual seasons of rain or diurnal seasons of\r\ncondensation and evaporation, or both these seasons, more or less--that\r\nis, in some degree.\r\n\r\n\"The original cause of motion in the atmosphere is the influence of the\r\nsun heating the surface of the earth exposed to that luminary. We have\r\nnot supposed that surface to have been of one uniform shape and similar\r\nsubstance; from whence it has followed that the annual propers of\r\nthe sun, perhaps also the diurnal propers, would produce a regular\r\ncondensation of rain in certain regions, and the evaporation of humidity\r\nin others; and this would have a regular progress in certain determined\r\nseasons, and would not vary. But nothing can be more distant from this\r\nsupposition, that is the natural constitution of the earth; for the\r\nglobe is composed of sea and land, in no regular shape or mixture, while\r\nthe surface of the land is also irregular with respect to its elevations\r\nand depressions, and various with regard to the humidity and dryness of\r\nthat part which is exposed to heat as the cause of evaporation. Hence a\r\nsource of the most valuable motions in the fluid atmosphere with aqueous\r\nvapor, more or less, so far as other natural operations will admit; and\r\nhence a source of the most irregular commixture of the several parts of\r\nthis elastic fluid, whether saturated or not with aqueous vapor.\r\n\r\n\"According to the theory, nothing is required for the production of rain\r\nbesides the mixture of portions of the atmosphere with humidity, and of\r\nmixing the parts that are in different degrees of heat. But we have seen\r\nthe causes of saturating every portion of the atmosphere with humidity\r\nand of mixing the parts which are in different degrees of heat.\r\nConsequently, over all the surface of the globe there should happen\r\noccasionally rain and evaporation, more or less; and also, in every\r\nplace, those vicissitudes should be observed to take place with some\r\ntendency to regularity, which, however, may be so disturbed as to be\r\nhardly distinguishable upon many occasions. Variable winds and variable\r\nrains should be found in proportion as each place is situated in an\r\nirregular mixture of land and water; whereas regular winds should be\r\nfound in proportion to the uniformity of the surface; and regular rains\r\nin proportion to the regular changes of those winds by which the mixture\r\nof the atmosphere necessary to the rain may be produced. But as it will\r\nbe acknowledged that this is the case in almost all this earth where\r\nrain appears according to the conditions here specified, the theory is\r\nfound to be thus in conformity with nature, and natural appearances are\r\nthus explained by the theory.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next ambitious attempt to explain the phenomena of aqueous meteors\r\nwas made by Luke Howard, in his remarkable paper on clouds, published in\r\nthe Philosophical Magazine in 1803--the paper in which the names cirrus,\r\ncumulus, stratus, etc., afterwards so universally adopted, were first\r\nproposed. In this paper Howard acknowledges his indebtedness to Dalton\r\nfor the theory of evaporation; yet he still clings to the idea that\r\nthe vapor, though independent of the air, is combined with particles of\r\ncaloric. He holds that clouds are composed of vapor that has previously\r\nrisen from the earth, combating the opinions of those who believe\r\nthat they are formed by the union of hydrogen and oxygen existing\r\nindependently in the air; though he agrees with these theorists that\r\nelectricity has entered largely into the modus operandi of cloud\r\nformation. He opposes the opinion of Deluc and De Saussure that clouds\r\nare composed of particles of water in the form of hollow vesicles\r\n(miniature balloons, in short, perhaps filled with hydrogen), which\r\nuntenable opinion was a revival of the theory as to the formation of all\r\nvapor which Dr. Halley had advocated early in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest are Howard's views as to the formation of dew,\r\nwhich he explains as caused by the particles of caloric forsaking the\r\nvapor to enter the cool body, leaving the water on the surface. This\r\ncomes as near the truth, perhaps, as could be expected while the old\r\nidea as to the materiality of heat held sway. Howard believed, however,\r\nthat dew is usually formed in the air at some height, and that it\r\nsettles to the surface, opposing the opinion, which had gained vogue\r\nin France and in America (where Noah Webster prominently advocated it),\r\nthat dew ascends from the earth.\r\n\r\nThe complete solution of the problem of dew formation--which really\r\ninvolved also the entire question of precipitation of watery vapor in\r\nany form--was made by Dr. W. C. Wells, a man of American birth, whose\r\nlife, however, after boyhood, was spent in Scotland (where as a young\r\nman he enjoyed the friendship of David Hume) and in London. Inspired,\r\nno doubt, by the researches of Mack, Hutton, and their confreres of\r\nthat Edinburgh school, Wells made observations on evaporation and\r\nprecipitation as early as 1784, but other things claimed his attention;\r\nand though he asserts that the subject was often in his mind, he did not\r\ntake it up again in earnest until about 1812.\r\n\r\nMeantime the observations on heat of Rumford and Davy and Leslie had\r\ncleared the way for a proper interpretation of the facts--about the\r\nfacts themselves there had long been practical unanimity of opinion. Dr.\r\nBlack, with his latent-heat observations, had really given the clew to\r\nall subsequent discussions of the subject of precipitation of vapor;\r\nand from this time on it had been known that heat is taken up when water\r\nevaporates, and given out again when it condenses. Dr. Darwin had shown\r\nin 1788, in a paper before the Royal Society, that air gives off heat\r\non contracting and takes it up on expanding; and Dalton, in his essay\r\nof 1793, had explained this phenomenon as due to the condensation and\r\nvaporization of the water contained in the air.\r\n\r\nBut some curious and puzzling observations which Professor Patrick\r\nWilson, professor of astronomy in the University of Glasgow, had\r\ncommunicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1784, and some similar\r\nones made by Mr. Six, of Canterbury, a few years later, had remained\r\nunexplained. Both these gentlemen observed that the air is cooler where\r\ndew is forming than the air a few feet higher, and they inferred\r\nthat the dew in forming had taken up heat, in apparent violation of\r\nestablished physical principles.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Wells, in his memorable paper of 1816, to show that\r\nthese observers had simply placed the cart before the horse. He made it\r\nclear that the air is not cooler because the dew is formed, but that\r\nthe dew is formed because the air is cooler--having become so through\r\nradiation of heat from the solids on which the dew forms. The dew\r\nitself, in forming, gives out its latent heat, and so tends to equalize\r\nthe temperature.\r\n\r\nWells's paper is so admirable an illustration of the lucid presentation\r\nof clearly conceived experiments and logical conclusions that we should\r\ndo it injustice not to present it entire. The author's mention of\r\nthe observations of Six and Wilson gives added value to his own\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Wells's Essay on Dew\r\n\r\n\"I was led in the autumn of 1784, by the event of a rude experiment,\r\nto think it probable that the formation of dew is attended with the\r\nproduction of cold. In 1788, a paper on hoar-frost, by Mr. Patrick\r\nWilson, of Glasgow, was published in the first volume of the\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, by which it appeared\r\nthat this opinion bad been entertained by that gentleman before it\r\nhad occurred to myself. In the course of the same year, Mr. Six, of\r\nCanterbury, mentioned in a paper communicated to the Royal Society\r\nthat on clear and dewy nights he always found the mercury lower in a\r\nthermometer laid upon the ground in a meadow in his neighborhood than\r\nit was in a similar thermometer suspended in the air six feet above the\r\nformer; and that upon one night the difference amounted to five degrees\r\nof Fahrenheit's scale. Mr. Six, however, did not suppose, agreeably to\r\nthe opinion of Mr. Wilson and myself, that the cold was occasioned by\r\nthe formation of dew, but imagined that it proceeded partly from the\r\nlow temperature of the air, through which the dew, already formed in the\r\natmosphere, had descended, and partly from the evaporation of moisture\r\nfrom the ground, on which his thermometer had been placed. The\r\nconjecture of Mr. Wilson and the observations of Mr. Six, together\r\nwith many facts which I afterwards learned in the course of reading,\r\nstrengthened my opinion; but I made no attempt, before the autumn of\r\n1811, to ascertain by experiment if it were just, though it had in\r\nthe mean time almost daily occurred to my thoughts. Happening, in\r\nthat season, to be in that country in a clear and calm night, I laid a\r\nthermometer upon grass wet with dew, and suspended a second in the air,\r\ntwo feet above the other. An hour afterwards the thermometer on the\r\ngrass was found to be eight degrees lower, by Fahrenheit's division,\r\nthan the one in the air. Similar results having been obtained from\r\nseveral similar experiments, made during the same autumn, I determined\r\nin the next spring to prosecute the subject with some degree of\r\nsteadiness, and with that view went frequently to the house of one of my\r\nfriends who lives in Surrey.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of two months I fancied that I had collected information\r\nworthy of being published; but, fortunately, while preparing an account\r\nof it I met by accident with a small posthumous work by Mr. Six, printed\r\nat Canterbury in 1794, in which are related differences observed on dewy\r\nnights between thermometers placed upon grass and others in the air that\r\nare much greater than those mentioned in the paper presented by him to\r\nthe Royal Society in 1788. In this work, too, the cold of the grass is\r\nattributed, in agreement with the opinion of Mr. Wilson, altogether to\r\nthe dew deposited upon it. The value of my own observations appearing to\r\nme now much diminished, though they embraced many points left untouched\r\nby Mr. Six, I gave up my intentions of making them known. Shortly after,\r\nhowever, upon considering the subject more closely, I began to suspect\r\nthat Mr. Wilson, Mr. Six, and myself had all committed an error\r\nregarding the cold which accompanies dew as an effect of the formation\r\nof that fluid. I therefore resumed my experiments, and having by means\r\nof them, I think, not only established the justness of my suspicions,\r\nbut ascertained the real cause both of dew and of several other natural\r\nappearances which have hitherto received no sufficient explanation, I\r\nventure now to submit to the consideration of the learned an account\r\nof some of my labors, without regard to the order of time in which they\r\nwere performed, and of various conclusions which may be drawn from them,\r\nmixed with facts and opinions already published by others:\r\n\r\n\"There are various occurrences in nature which seem to me strictly\r\nallied to dew, though their relation to it be not always at first sight\r\nperceivable. The statement and explanation of several of these will form\r\nthe concluding part of the present essay.\r\n\r\n\"1. I observed one morning, in winter, that the insides of the panes of\r\nglass in the windows of my bedchamber were all of them moist, but that\r\nthose which had been covered by an inside shutter during the night were\r\nmuch more so than the others which had been uncovered. Supposing that\r\nthis diversity of appearance depended upon a difference of temperature,\r\nI applied the naked bulbs of two delicate thermometers to a covered\r\nand uncovered pane; on which I found that the former was three degrees\r\ncolder than the latter. The air of the chamber, though no fire was kept\r\nin it, was at this time eleven and one-half degrees warmer than that\r\nwithout. Similar experiments were made on many other mornings, the\r\nresults of which were that the warmth of the internal air exceeded that\r\nof the external from eight to eighteen degrees, the temperature of the\r\ncovered panes would be from one to five degrees less than the uncovered;\r\nthat the covered were sometimes dewed, while the uncovered were dry;\r\nthat at other times both were free from moisture; that the outsides of\r\nthe covered and uncovered panes had similar differences with respect to\r\nheat, though not so great as those of the inner surfaces; and that no\r\nvariation in the quantity of these differences was occasioned by the\r\nweather's being cloudy or fair, provided the heat of the internal air\r\nexceeded that of the external equally in both of those states of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"The remote reason of these differences did not immediately present\r\nitself. I soon, however, saw that the closed shutter shielded the glass\r\nwhich it covered from the heat that was radiated to the windows by\r\nthe walls and furniture of the room, and thus kept it nearer to the\r\ntemperature of the external air than those parts could be which, from\r\nbeing uncovered, received the heat emitted to them by the bodies just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\"In making these experiments, I seldom observed the inside of any pane\r\nto be more than a little damped, though it might be from eight to twelve\r\ndegrees colder than the general mass of the air in the room; while, in\r\nthe open air, I had often found a great dew to form on substances\r\nonly three or four degrees colder than the atmosphere. This at first\r\nsurprised me; but the cause now seems plain. The air of the chamber had\r\nonce been a portion of the external atmosphere, and had afterwards\r\nbeen heated, when it could receive little accessories to its original\r\nmoisture. It constantly required being cooled considerably before it\r\nwas even brought back to its former nearness to repletion with water;\r\nwhereas the whole external air is commonly, at night, nearly replete\r\nwith moisture, and therefore readily precipitates dew on bodies only a\r\nlittle colder than itself.\r\n\r\n\"When the air of a room is warmer than the external atmosphere, the\r\neffect of an outside shutter on the temperature of the glass of the\r\nwindow will be directly opposite to what has just been stated; since\r\nit must prevent the radiation, into the atmosphere, of the heat of the\r\nchamber transmitted through the glass.\r\n\r\n\"2. Count Rumford appears to have rightly conjectured that the\r\ninhabitants of certain hot countries, who sleep at nights on the tops of\r\ntheir houses, are cooled during this exposure by the radiation of their\r\nheat to the sky; or, according to his manner of expression, by receiving\r\nfrigorific rays from the heavens. Another fact of this kind seems to be\r\nthe greater chill which we often experience upon passing at night from\r\nthe cover of a house into the air than might have been expected from the\r\ncold of the external atmosphere. The cause, indeed, is said to be the\r\nquickness of transition from one situation to another. But if this were\r\nthe whole reason, an equal chill would be felt in the day, when the\r\ndifference, in point of heat, between the internal and external air was\r\nthe same as at night, which is not the case. Besides, if I can trust my\r\nown observation, the feeling of cold from this cause is more remarkable\r\nin a clear than in a cloudy night, and in the country than in towns. The\r\nfollowing appears to be the manner in which these things are chiefly to\r\nbe explained:\r\n\r\n\"During the day our bodies while in the open air, although not\r\nimmediately exposed to the sun's rays, are yet constantly deriving\r\nheat from them by means of the reflection of the atmosphere. This heat,\r\nthough it produces little change on the temperature of the air which it\r\ntraverses, affords us some compensation for the heat which we radiate to\r\nthe heavens. At night, also, if the sky be overcast, some compensation\r\nwill be made to us, both in the town and in the country, though in a\r\nless degree than during the day, as the clouds will remit towards the\r\nearth no inconsiderable quantity of heat. But on a clear night, in an\r\nopen part of the country, nothing almost can be returned to us from\r\nabove in place of the heat which we radiate upward. In towns, however,\r\nsome compensation will be afforded even on the clearest nights for the\r\nheat which we lose in the open air by that which is radiated to us from\r\nthe sun round buildings.\r\n\r\n\"To our loss of heat by radiation at times that we derive little\r\ncompensation from the radiation of other bodies is probably to be\r\nattributed a great part of the hurtful effects of the night air.\r\nDescartes says that these are not owing to dew, as was the common\r\nopinion of his contemporaries, but to the descent of certain noxious\r\nvapors which have been exhaled from the earth during the heat of the\r\nday, and are afterwards condensed by the cold of a serene night. The\r\neffects in question certainly cannot be occasioned by dew, since that\r\nfluid does not form upon a healthy human body in temperate climates; but\r\nthey may, notwithstanding, arise from the same cause that produces dew\r\non those substances which do not, like the human body, possess the power\r\nof generating heat for the supply of what they lose by radiation or any\r\nother means.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis explanation made it plain why dew forms on a clear night, when\r\nthere are no clouds to reflect the radiant heat. Combined with Dalton's\r\ntheory that vapor is an independent gas, limited in quantity in any\r\ngiven space by the temperature of that space, it solved the problem of\r\nthe formation of clouds, rain, snow, and hoar-frost. Thus this paper\r\nof Wells's closed the epoch of speculation regarding this field of\r\nmeteorology, as Hutton's paper of 1784 had opened it. The fact that the\r\nvolume containing Hutton's paper contained also his epoch-making paper\r\non geology finds curiously a duplication in the fact that Wells's volume\r\ncontained also his essay on Albinism, in which the doctrine of natural\r\nselection was for the first time formulated, as Charles Darwin freely\r\nadmitted after his own efforts had made the doctrine famous.\r\n\r\n\r\nISOTHERMS AND OCEAN CURRENTS\r\n\r\nThe very next year after Dr. Wells's paper was published there appeared\r\nin France the third volume of the Memoires de Physique et de Chimie de\r\nla Societe d'Arcueil, and a new epoch in meteorology was inaugurated.\r\nThe society in question was numerically an inconsequential band, listing\r\nonly a dozen members; but every name was a famous one: Arago, Berard,\r\nBerthollet, Biot, Chaptal, De Candolle, Dulong, Gay-Lussac, Humboldt,\r\nLaplace, Poisson, and Thenard--rare spirits every one. Little danger\r\nthat the memoirs of such a band would be relegated to the dusty shelves\r\nwhere most proceedings of societies belong--no milk-for-babes fare would\r\nbe served to such a company.\r\n\r\nThe particular paper which here interests us closes this third and\r\nlast volume of memoirs. It is entitled \"Des Lignes Isothermes et de\r\nla Distribution de la Chaleursurle Globe.\" The author is Alexander\r\nHumboldt. Needless to say, the topic is handled in a masterly\r\nmanner. The distribution of heat on the surface of the globe, on the\r\nmountain-sides, in the interior of the earth; the causes that regulate\r\nsuch distribution; the climatic results--these are the topics discussed.\r\nBut what gives epochal character to the paper is the introduction of\r\nthose isothermal lines circling the earth in irregular course, joining\r\ntogether places having the same mean annual temperature, and thus laying\r\nthe foundation for a science of comparative climatology.\r\n\r\nIt is true the attempt to study climates comparatively was not new.\r\nMairan had attempted it in those papers in which he developed his\r\nbizarre ideas as to central emanations of heat. Euler had brought\r\nhis profound mathematical genius to bear on the topic, evolving the\r\n\"extraordinary conclusion that under the equator at midnight the\r\ncold ought to be more rigorous than at the poles in winter.\" And\r\nin particular Richard Kirwan, the English chemist, had combined the\r\nmathematical and the empirical methods and calculated temperatures for\r\nall latitudes. But Humboldt differs from all these predecessors in that\r\nhe grasps the idea that the basis of all such computations should be\r\nnot theory, but fact. He drew his isothermal lines not where some occult\r\ncalculation would locate them on an ideal globe, but where practical\r\ntests with the thermometer locate them on our globe as it is. London,\r\nfor example, lies in the same latitude as the southern extremity of\r\nHudson Bay; but the isotherm of London, as Humboldt outlines it, passes\r\nthrough Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nOf course such deviations of climatic conditions between places in the\r\nsame latitude had long been known. As Humboldt himself observes,\r\nthe earliest settlers of America were astonished to find themselves\r\nsubjected to rigors of climate for which their European experience had\r\nnot at all prepared them. Moreover, sagacious travellers, in particular\r\nCook's companion on his second voyage, young George Forster, had\r\nnoted as a general principle that the western borders of continents\r\nin temperate regions are always warmer than corresponding latitudes of\r\ntheir eastern borders; and of course the general truth of temperatures\r\nbeing milder in the vicinity of the sea than in the interior of\r\ncontinents had long been familiar. But Humboldt's isothermal lines for\r\nthe first time gave tangibility to these ideas, and made practicable a\r\ntruly scientific study of comparative climatology.\r\n\r\nIn studying these lines, particularly as elaborated by further\r\nobservations, it became clear that they are by no means haphazard in\r\narrangement, but are dependent upon geographical conditions which in\r\nmost cases are not difficult to determine. Humboldt himself pointed out\r\nvery clearly the main causes that tend to produce deviations from the\r\naverage--or, as Dove later on called it, the normal--temperature of any\r\ngiven latitude. For example, the mean annual temperature of a region\r\n(referring mainly to the northern hemisphere) is raised by the proximity\r\nof a western coast; by a divided configuration of the continent into\r\npeninsulas; by the existence of open seas to the north or of radiating\r\ncontinental surfaces to the south; by mountain ranges to shield from\r\ncold winds; by the infrequency of swamps to become congealed; by the\r\nabsence of woods in a dry, sandy soil; and by the serenity of sky in the\r\nsummer months and the vicinity of an ocean current bringing water which\r\nis of a higher temperature than that of the surrounding sea.\r\n\r\nConditions opposite to these tend, of course, correspondingly to lower\r\nthe temperature. In a word, Humboldt says the climatic distribution of\r\nheat depends on the relative distribution of land and sea, and on the\r\n\"hypsometrical configuration of the continents\"; and he urges that\r\n\"great meteorological phenomena cannot be comprehended when considered\r\nindependently of geognostic relations\"--a truth which, like most other\r\ngeneral principles, seems simple enough once it is pointed out.\r\n\r\nWith that broad sweep of imagination which characterized him, Humboldt\r\nspeaks of the atmosphere as the \"aerial ocean, in the lower strata\r\nand on the shoals of which we live,\" and he studies the atmospheric\r\nphenomena always in relation to those of that other ocean of water. In\r\neach of these oceans there are vast permanent currents, flowing\r\nalways in determinate directions, which enormously modify the climatic\r\nconditions of every zone. The ocean of air is a vast maelstrom, boiling\r\nup always under the influence of the sun's heat at the equator, and\r\nflowing as an upper current towards either pole, while an undercurrent\r\nfrom the poles, which becomes the trade-winds, flows towards the equator\r\nto supply its place.\r\n\r\nBut the superheated equatorial air, becoming chilled, descends to the\r\nsurface in temperate latitudes, and continues its poleward journey as\r\nthe anti-trade-winds. The trade-winds are deflected towards the west,\r\nbecause in approaching the equator they constantly pass over surfaces of\r\nthe earth having a greater and greater velocity of rotation, and so, as\r\nit were, tend to lag behind--an explanation which Hadley pointed out in\r\n1735, but which was not accepted until Dalton independently worked it\r\nout and promulgated it in 1793. For the opposite reason, the anti-trades\r\nare deflected towards the east; hence it is that the western, borders\r\nof continents in temperate zones are bathed in moist sea-breezes, while\r\ntheir eastern borders lack this cold-dispelling influence.\r\n\r\nIn the ocean of water the main currents run as more sharply\r\ncircumscribed streams--veritable rivers in the sea. Of these the best\r\nknown and most sharply circumscribed is the familiar Gulf Stream,\r\nwhich has its origin in an equatorial current, impelled westward by\r\ntrade-winds, which is deflected northward in the main at Cape St. Roque,\r\nentering the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, to emerge finally through\r\nthe Strait of Florida, and journey off across the Atlantic to warm the\r\nshores of Europe.\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, is the Gulf Stream as Humboldt understood it. Since his\r\ntime, however, ocean currents in general, and this one in particular,\r\nhave been the subject of no end of controversy, it being hotly disputed\r\nwhether either causes or effects of the Gulf Stream are just what\r\nHumboldt, in common with others of his time, conceived them to be. About\r\nthe middle of the century Lieutenant M. F. Maury, the distinguished\r\nAmerican hydrographer and meteorologist, advocated a theory of\r\ngravitation as the chief cause of the currents, claiming that difference\r\nin density, due to difference in temperature and saltness, would\r\nsufficiently account for the oceanic circulation. This theory gained\r\ngreat popularity through the wide circulation of Maury's Physical\r\nGeography of the Sea, which is said to have passed through more editions\r\nthan any other scientific book of the period; but it was ably and\r\nvigorously combated by Dr. James Croll, the Scottish geologist, in his\r\nClimate and Time, and latterly the old theory that ocean currents are\r\ndue to the trade-winds has again come into favor. Indeed, very recently\r\na model has been constructed, with the aid of which it is said to have\r\nbeen demonstrated that prevailing winds in the direction of the actual\r\ntrade-winds would produce such a current as the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, it is by no means sure that gravitation does not\r\nenter into the case to the extent of producing an insensible general\r\noceanic circulation, independent of the Gulf Stream and similar marked\r\ncurrents, and similar in its larger outlines to the polar-equatorial\r\ncirculation of the air. The idea of such oceanic circulation was first\r\nsuggested in detail by Professor Lenz, of St. Petersburg, in 1845, but\r\nit was not generally recognized until Dr. Carpenter independently hit\r\nupon the idea more than twenty years later. The plausibility of the\r\nconception is obvious; yet the alleged fact of such circulation has been\r\nhotly disputed, and the question is still sub judice.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not such general circulation of ocean water takes place,\r\nit is beyond dispute that the recognized currents carry an enormous\r\nquantity of heat from the tropics towards the poles. Dr. Croll, who has\r\nperhaps given more attention to the physics of the subject than almost\r\nany other person, computes that the Gulf Stream conveys to the North\r\nAtlantic one-fourth as much heat as that body receives directly from the\r\nsun, and he argues that were it not for the transportation of heat by\r\nthis and similar Pacific currents, only a narrow tropical region of the\r\nglobe would be warm enough for habitation by the existing faunas. Dr.\r\nCroll argues that a slight change in the relative values of northern\r\nand southern trade-winds (such as he believes has taken place at various\r\nperiods in the past) would suffice to so alter the equatorial current\r\nwhich now feeds the Gulf Stream that its main bulk would be deflected\r\nsouthward instead of northward, by the angle of Cape St. Roque. Thus the\r\nGulf Stream would be nipped in the bud, and, according to Dr. Croll's\r\nestimates, the results would be disastrous for the northern hemisphere.\r\nThe anti-trades, which now are warmed by the Gulf Stream, would then\r\nblow as cold winds across the shores of western Europe, and in all\r\nprobability a glacial epoch would supervene throughout the northern\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe same consequences, so far as Europe is concerned at least, would\r\napparently ensue were the Isthmus of Panama to settle into the sea,\r\nallowing the Caribbean current to pass into the Pacific. But the\r\ngeologist tells us that this isthmus rose at a comparatively recent\r\ngeological period, though it is hinted that there had been some time\r\npreviously a temporary land connection between the two continents. Are\r\nwe to infer, then, that the two Americas in their unions and disunions\r\nhave juggled with the climate of the other hemisphere? Apparently so, if\r\nthe estimates made of the influence of the Gulf Stream be tenable. It is\r\na far cry from Panama to Russia. Yet it seems within the possibilities\r\nthat the meteorologist may learn from the geologist of Central America\r\nsomething that will enable him to explain to the paleontologist of\r\nEurope how it chanced that at one time the mammoth and rhinoceros roamed\r\nacross northern Siberia, while at another time the reindeer and musk-ox\r\nbrowsed along the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nPossibilities, I said, not probabilities. Yet even the faint glimmer of\r\nso alluring a possibility brings home to one with vividness the truth\r\nof Humboldt's perspicuous observation that meteorology can be properly\r\ncomprehended only when studied in connection with the companion\r\nsciences. There are no isolated phenomena in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLONES AND ANTI-CYCLONES\r\n\r\nYet, after all, it is not to be denied that the chief concern of the\r\nmeteorologist must be with that other medium, the \"ocean of air, on\r\nthe shoals of which we live.\" For whatever may be accomplished by water\r\ncurrents in the way of conveying heat, it is the wind currents that\r\neffect the final distribution of that heat. As Dr. Croll has urged, the\r\nwaters of the Gulf Stream do not warm the shores of Europe by direct\r\ncontact, but by warming the anti-trade-winds, which subsequently blow\r\nacross the continent. And everywhere the heat accumulated by water\r\nbecomes effectual in modifying climate, not so much by direct radiation\r\nas by diffusion through the medium of the air.\r\n\r\nThis very obvious importance of aerial currents led to their practical\r\nstudy long before meteorology had any title to the rank of science, and\r\nDalton's explanation of the trade-winds had laid the foundation for a\r\nscience of wind dynamics before the beginning of the nineteenth century.\r\nBut no substantial further advance in this direction was effected until\r\nabout 1827, when Heinrich W. Dove, of Konigsberg, afterwards to be known\r\nas perhaps the foremost meteorologist of his generation, included\r\nthe winds among the subjects of his elaborate statistical studies in\r\nclimatology.\r\n\r\nDove classified the winds as permanent, periodical, and variable. His\r\ngreat discovery was that all winds, of whatever character, and not\r\nmerely the permanent winds, come under the influence of the earth's\r\nrotation in such a way as to be deflected from their course, and hence\r\nto take on a gyratory motion--that, in short, all local winds are minor\r\neddies in the great polar-equatorial whirl, and tend to reproduce in\r\nminiature the character of that vast maelstrom. For the first time,\r\nthen, temporary or variable winds were seen to lie within the province\r\nof law.\r\n\r\nA generation later, Professor William Ferrel, the American\r\nmeteorologist, who had been led to take up the subject by a perusal of\r\nMaury's discourse on ocean winds, formulated a general mathematical law,\r\nto the effect that any body moving in a right line along the surface of\r\nthe earth in any direction tends to have its course deflected, owing to\r\nthe earth's rotation, to the right hand in the northern and to the left\r\nhand in the southern hemisphere. This law had indeed been stated as\r\nearly as 1835 by the French physicist Poisson, but no one then thought\r\nof it as other than a mathematical curiosity; its true significance was\r\nonly understood after Professor Ferrel had independently rediscovered it\r\n(just as Dalton rediscovered Hadley's forgotten law of the trade-winds)\r\nand applied it to the motion of wind currents.\r\n\r\nThen it became clear that here is a key to the phenomena of atmospheric\r\ncirculation, from the great polar-equatorial maelstrom which manifests\r\nitself in the trade-winds to the most circumscribed riffle which is\r\nannounced as a local storm. And the more the phenomena were studied,\r\nthe more striking seemed the parallel between the greater maelstrom\r\nand these lesser eddies. Just as the entire atmospheric mass of each\r\nhemisphere is seen, when viewed as a whole, to be carried in a great\r\nwhirl about the pole of that hemisphere, so the local disturbances\r\nwithin this great tide are found always to take the form of whirls about\r\na local storm-centre--which storm-centre, meantime, is carried along\r\nin the major current, as one often sees a little whirlpool in the water\r\nswept along with the main current of the stream. Sometimes, indeed, the\r\nlocal eddy, caught as it were in an ancillary current of the great\r\npolar stream, is deflected from its normal course and may seem to travel\r\nagainst the stream; but such deviations are departures from the rule. In\r\nthe great majority of cases, for example, in the north temperate zone, a\r\nstorm-centre (with its attendant local whirl) travels to the northeast,\r\nalong the main current of the anti-trade-wind, of which it is a part;\r\nand though exceptionally its course may be to the southeast instead, it\r\nalmost never departs so widely from the main channel as to progress to\r\nthe westward. Thus it is that storms sweeping over the United States can\r\nbe announced, as a rule, at the seaboard in advance of their coming by\r\ntelegraphic communication from the interior, while similar storms\r\ncome to Europe off the ocean unannounced. Hence the more practical\r\navailability of the forecasts of weather bureaus in the former country.\r\n\r\nBut these local whirls, it must be understood, are local only in a very\r\ngeneral sense of the word, inasmuch as a single one may be more than\r\na thousand miles in diameter, and a small one is two or three hundred\r\nmiles across. But quite without regard to the size of the whirl, the air\r\ncomposing it conducts itself always in one of two ways. It never whirls\r\nin concentric circles; it always either rushes in towards the centre in\r\na descending spiral, in which case it is called a cyclone, or it spreads\r\nout from the centre in a widening spiral, in which case it is called an\r\nanti-cyclone. The word cyclone is associated in popular phraseology with\r\na terrific storm, but it has no such restriction in technical usage. A\r\ngentle zephyr flowing towards a \"storm-centre\" is just as much a\r\ncyclone to the meteorologist as is the whirl constituting a West-Indian\r\nhurricane. Indeed, it is not properly the wind itself that is called the\r\ncyclone in either case, but the entire system of whirls--including the\r\nstorm-centre itself, where there may be no wind at all.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this storm-centre? Merely an area of low barometric\r\npressure--an area where the air has become lighter than the air of\r\nsurrounding regions. Under influence of gravitation the air seeks its\r\nlevel just as water does; so the heavy air comes flowing in from\r\nall sides towards the low-pressure area, which thus becomes a\r\n\"storm-centre.\" But the inrushing currents never come straight to their\r\nmark. In accordance with Ferrel's law, they are deflected to the right,\r\nand the result, as will readily be seen, must be a vortex current, which\r\nwhirls always in one direction--namely, from left to right, or in the\r\ndirection opposite to that of the hands of a watch held with its face\r\nupward. The velocity of the cyclonic currents will depend largely upon\r\nthe difference in barometric pressure between the storm-centre and the\r\nconfines of the cyclone system. And the velocity of the currents will\r\ndetermine to some extent the degree of deflection, and hence the exact\r\npath of the descending spiral in which the wind approaches the centre.\r\nBut in every case and in every part of the cyclone system it is true, as\r\nBuys Ballot's famous rule first pointed out, that a person standing with\r\nhis back to the wind has the storm-centre at his left.\r\n\r\nThe primary cause of the low barometric pressure which marks the\r\nstorm-centre and establishes the cyclone is expansion of the air through\r\nexcess of temperature. The heated air, rising into cold upper regions,\r\nhas a portion of its vapor condensed into clouds, and now a new dynamic\r\nfactor is added, for each particle of vapor, in condensing, gives up its\r\nmodicum of latent heat. Each pound of vapor thus liberates, according\r\nto Professor Tyndall's estimate, enough heat to melt five pounds of cast\r\niron; so the amount given out where large masses of cloud are forming\r\nmust enormously add to the convection currents of the air, and hence to\r\nthe storm-developing power of the forming cyclone. Indeed, one school\r\nof meteorologists, of whom Professor Espy was the leader, has held that,\r\nwithout such added increment of energy constantly augmenting the dynamic\r\neffects, no storm could long continue in violent action. And it is\r\ndoubted whether any storm could ever attain, much less continue, the\r\nterrific force of that most dreaded of winds of temperate zones, the\r\ntornado--a storm which obeys all the laws of cyclones, but differs from\r\nordinary cyclones in having a vortex core only a few feet or yards in\r\ndiameter--without the aid of those great masses of condensing vapor\r\nwhich always accompany it in the form of storm-clouds.\r\n\r\nThe anti-cyclone simply reverses the conditions of the cyclone. Its\r\ncentre is an area of high pressure, and the air rushes out from it in\r\nall directions towards surrounding regions of low pressure. As before,\r\nall parts of the current will be deflected towards the right, and\r\nthe result, clearly, is a whirl opposite in direction to that of the\r\ncyclone. But here there is a tendency to dissipation rather than to\r\nconcentration of energy, hence, considered as a storm-generator, the\r\nanti-cyclone is of relative insignificance.\r\n\r\nIn particular the professional meteorologist who conducts a \"weather\r\nbureau\"--as, for example, the chief of the United States signal-service\r\nstation in New York--is so preoccupied with the observation of this\r\nphenomenon that cyclone-hunting might be said to be his chief pursuit.\r\nIt is for this purpose, in the main, that government weather bureaus\r\nor signal-service departments have been established all over the world.\r\nTheir chief work is to follow up cyclones, with the aid of telegraphic\r\nreports, mapping their course and recording the attendant meteorological\r\nconditions. Their so-called predictions or forecasts are essentially\r\npredications, gaining locally the effect of predictions because the\r\ntelegraph outstrips the wind.\r\n\r\nAt only one place on the globe has it been possible as yet for the\r\nmeteorologist to make long-time forecasts meriting the title of\r\npredictions. This is in the middle Ganges Valley of northern India.\r\nIn this country the climatic conditions are largely dependent upon the\r\nperiodical winds called monsoons, which blow steadily landward from\r\nApril to October, and seaward from October to April. The summer monsoons\r\nbring the all-essential rains; if they are delayed or restricted\r\nin extent, there will be drought and consequent famine. And such\r\nrestriction of the monsoon is likely to result when there has been an\r\nunusually deep or very late snowfall on the Himalayas, because of the\r\nlowering of spring temperature by the melting snow. Thus here it is\r\npossible, by observing the snowfall in the mountains, to predict with\r\nsome measure of success the average rainfall of the following summer.\r\nThe drought of 1896, with the consequent famine and plague that\r\ndevastated India the following winter, was thus predicted some months in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThis is the greatest present triumph of practical meteorology. Nothing\r\nlike it is yet possible anywhere in temperate zones. But no one can\r\nsay what may not be possible in times to come, when the data now being\r\ngathered all over the world shall at last be co-ordinated, classified,\r\nand made the basis of broad inductions. Meteorology is pre-eminently a\r\nscience of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MODERN THEORIES OF HEAT AND LIGHT\r\n\r\nTHE eighteenth-century philosopher made great strides in his studies\r\nof the physical properties of matter and the application of these\r\nproperties in mechanics, as the steam-engine, the balloon, the optic\r\ntelegraph, the spinning-jenny, the cotton-gin, the chronometer, the\r\nperfected compass, the Leyden jar, the lightning-rod, and a host of\r\nminor inventions testify. In a speculative way he had thought out more\r\nor less tenable conceptions as to the ultimate nature of matter, as\r\nwitness the theories of Leibnitz and Boscovich and Davy, to which we\r\nmay recur. But he had not as yet conceived the notion of a distinction\r\nbetween matter and energy, which is so fundamental to the physics of a\r\nlater epoch. He did not speak of heat, light, electricity, as forms\r\nof energy or \"force\"; he conceived them as subtile forms of matter--as\r\nhighly attenuated yet tangible fluids, subject to gravitation and\r\nchemical attraction; though he had learned to measure none of them but\r\nheat with accuracy, and this one he could test only within narrow limits\r\nuntil late in the century, when Josiah Wedgwood, the famous potter,\r\ntaught him to gauge the highest temperatures with the clay pyrometer.\r\n\r\nHe spoke of the matter of heat as being the most universally distributed\r\nfluid in nature; as entering in some degree into the composition of\r\nnearly all other substances; as being sometimes liquid, sometimes\r\ncondensed or solid, and as having weight that could be detected with\r\nthe balance. Following Newton, he spoke of light as a \"corpuscular\r\nemanation\" or fluid, composed of shining particles which possibly are\r\ntransmutable into particles of heat, and which enter into chemical\r\ncombination with the particles of other forms of matter. Electricity\r\nhe considered a still more subtile kind of matter-perhaps an attenuated\r\nform of light. Magnetism, \"vital fluid,\" and by some even a \"gravic\r\nfluid,\" and a fluid of sound were placed in the same scale; and, taken\r\ntogether, all these supposed subtile forms of matter were classed as\r\n\"imponderables.\"\r\n\r\nThis view of the nature of the \"imponderables\" was in some measure a\r\nretrogression, for many seventeenth-century philosophers, notably\r\nHooke and Huygens and Boyle, had held more correct views; but the\r\nmaterialistic conception accorded so well with the eighteenth-century\r\ntendencies of thought that only here and there a philosopher like Euler\r\ncalled it in question, until well on towards the close of the century.\r\nCurrent speech referred to the materiality of the \"imponderables\"\r\nunquestioningly. Students of meteorology--a science that was just\r\ndawning--explained atmospheric phenomena on the supposition that heat,\r\nthe heaviest imponderable, predominated in the lower atmosphere, and\r\nthat light, electricity, and magnetism prevailed in successively higher\r\nstrata. And Lavoisier, the most philosophical chemist of the century,\r\nretained heat and light on a par with oxygen, hydrogen, iron, and the\r\nrest, in his list of elementary substances.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT RUMFORD AND THE VIBRATORY THEORY OF HEAT\r\n\r\nBut just at the close of the century the confidence in the status of\r\nthe imponderables was rudely shaken in the minds of philosophers by the\r\nrevival of the old idea of Fra Paolo and Bacon and Boyle, that heat,\r\nat any rate, is not a material fluid, but merely a mode of motion or\r\nvibration among the particles of \"ponderable\" matter. The new champion\r\nof the old doctrine as to the nature of heat was a very distinguished\r\nphilosopher and diplomatist of the time, who, it may be worth recalling,\r\nwas an American. He was a sadly expatriated American, it is true, as his\r\nname, given all the official appendages, will amply testify; but he had\r\nbeen born and reared in a Massachusetts village none the less, and\r\nhe seems always to have retained a kindly interest in the land of his\r\nnativity, even though he lived abroad in the service of other powers\r\nduring all the later years of his life, and was knighted by England,\r\nennobled by Bavaria, and honored by the most distinguished scientific\r\nbodies of Europe. The American, then, who championed the vibratory\r\ntheory of heat, in opposition to all current opinion, in this closing\r\nera of the eighteenth century, was Lieutenant-General Sir Benjamin\r\nThompson, Count Rumford, F.R.S.\r\n\r\nRumford showed that heat may be produced in indefinite quantities by\r\nfriction of bodies that do not themselves lose any appreciable matter\r\nin the process, and claimed that this proves the immateriality of heat.\r\nLater on he added force to the argument by proving, in refutation of the\r\nexperiments of Bowditch, that no body either gains or loses weight in\r\nvirtue of being heated or cooled. He thought he had proved that heat is\r\nonly a form of motion.\r\n\r\nHis experiment for producing indefinite quantities of heat by friction\r\nis recorded by him in his paper entitled, \"Inquiry Concerning the Source\r\nof Heat Excited by Friction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Being engaged, lately, in superintending the boring of cannon in the\r\nworkshops of the military arsenal at Munich,\" he says, \"I was struck\r\nwith the very considerable degree of heat which a brass gun acquires in\r\na short time in being bored; and with the still more intense heat (much\r\ngreater than that of boiling water, as I found by experiment) of the\r\nmetallic chips separated from it by the borer.\r\n\r\n\"Taking a cannon (a brass six-pounder), cast solid, and rough, as it\r\ncame from the foundry, and fixing it horizontally in a machine used\r\nfor boring, and at the same time finishing the outside of the cannon by\r\nturning, I caused its extremity to be cut off; and by turning down\r\nthe metal in that part, a solid cylinder was formed, 7 3/4 inches in\r\ndiameter and 9 8/10 inches long; which, when finished, remained joined\r\nto the rest of the metal (that which, properly speaking, constituted the\r\ncannon) by a small cylindrical neck, only 2 1/5 inches in diameter and 3\r\n8/10 inches long.\r\n\r\n\"This short cylinder, which was supported in its horizontal position,\r\nand turned round its axis by means of the neck by which it remained\r\nunited to the cannon, was now bored with the horizontal borer used in\r\nboring cannon.\r\n\r\n\"This cylinder being designed for the express purpose of generating heat\r\nby friction, by having a blunt borer forced against its solid bottom at\r\nthe same time that it should be turned round its axis by the force of\r\nhorses, in order that the heat accumulated in the cylinder might from\r\ntime to time be measured, a small, round hole 0.37 of an inch only in\r\ndiameter and 4.2 inches in depth, for the purpose of introducing a small\r\ncylindrical mercurial thermometer, was made in it, on one side, in a\r\ndirection perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, and ending in the\r\nmiddle of the solid part of the metal which formed the bottom of the\r\nbore.\r\n\r\n\"At the beginning of the experiment, the temperature of the air in the\r\nshade, as also in the cylinder, was just sixty degrees Fahrenheit. At\r\nthe end of thirty minutes, when the cylinder had made 960 revolutions\r\nabout its axis, the horses being stopped, a cylindrical mercury\r\nthermometer, whose bulb was 32/100 of an inch in diameter and 3 1/4\r\ninches in length, was introduced into the hole made to receive it in\r\nthe side of the cylinder, when the mercury rose almost instantly to one\r\nhundred and thirty degrees.\r\n\r\n\"In order, by one decisive experiment, to determine whether the air\r\nof the atmosphere had any part or not in the generation of the heat, I\r\ncontrived to repeat the experiment under circumstances in which it was\r\nevidently impossible for it to produce any effect whatever. By means\r\nof a piston exactly fitted to the mouth of the bore of the cylinder,\r\nthrough the middle of which piston the square iron bar, to the end of\r\nwhich the blunt steel borer was fixed, passed in a square hole made\r\nperfectly air-tight, the excess of the external air, to the inside of\r\nthe bore of the cylinder, was effectually prevented. I did not find,\r\nhowever, by this experiment that the exclusion of the air diminished in\r\nthe smallest degree the quantity of heat excited by the friction.\r\n\r\n\"There still remained one doubt, which, though it appeared to me to be\r\nso slight as hardly to deserve any attention, I was, however, desirous\r\nto remove. The piston which choked the mouth of the bore of the\r\ncylinder, in order that it might be air-tight, was fitted into it with\r\nso much nicety, by means of its collars of leather, and pressed against\r\nit with so much force, that, notwithstanding its being oiled, it\r\noccasioned a considerable degree of friction when the hollow cylinder\r\nwas turned round its axis. Was not the heat produced, or at least some\r\npart of it, occasioned by this friction of the piston? and, as the\r\nexternal air had free access to the extremity of the bore, where it came\r\ninto contact with the piston, is it not possible that this air may have\r\nhad some share in the generation of the heat produced?\r\n\r\n\"A quadrangular oblong deal box, water-tight, being provided with\r\nholes or slits in the middle of each of its ends, just large enough to\r\nreceive, the one the square iron rod to the end of which the blunt steel\r\nborer was fastened, the other the small cylindrical neck which joined\r\nthe hollow cylinder to the cannon; when this box (which was occasionally\r\nclosed above by a wooden cover or lid moving on hinges) was put into\r\nits place--that is to say, when, by means of the two vertical opening\r\nor slits in its two ends, the box was fixed to the machinery in such\r\na manner that its bottom being in the plane of the horizon, its axis\r\ncoincided with the axis of the hollow metallic cylinder, it is evident,\r\nfrom the description, that the hollow, metallic cylinder would occupy\r\nthe middle of the box, without touching it on either side; and that,\r\non pouring water into the box and filling it to the brim, the cylinder\r\nwould be completely covered and surrounded on every side by that fluid.\r\nAnd, further, as the box was held fast by the strong, square iron rod\r\nwhich passed in a square hole in the centre of one of its ends, while\r\nthe round or cylindrical neck which joined the hollow cylinder to the\r\nend of the cannon could turn round freely on its axis in the round hole\r\nin the centre of the other end of it, it is evident that the machinery\r\ncould be put in motion without the least danger of forcing the box out\r\nof its place, throwing the water out of it, or deranging any part of the\r\napparatus.\"\r\n\r\nEverything being thus ready, the box was filled with cold water, having\r\nbeen made water-tight by means of leather collars, and the machinery put\r\nin motion. \"The result of this beautiful experiment,\" says Rumford, \"was\r\nvery striking, and the pleasure it afforded me amply repaid me for\r\nall the trouble I had had in contriving and arranging the complicated\r\nmachinery used in making it. The cylinder, revolving at the rate of\r\nthirty-two times in a minute, had been in motion but a short time when I\r\nperceived, by putting my hand into the water and touching the outside\r\nof the cylinder, that heat was generated, and it was not long before the\r\nwater which surrounded the cylinder began to be sensibly warm.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of one hour I found, by plunging a thermometer into the\r\nbox,... that its temperature had been raised no less than forty-seven\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, being now one hundred and seven degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n... One hour and thirty minutes after the machinery had been put in\r\nmotion the heat of the water in the box was one hundred and forty-two\r\ndegrees. At the end of two hours... it was raised to one hundred and\r\nseventy-eight degrees; and at two hours and thirty minutes it ACTUALLY\r\nBOILED!\r\n\r\n\"It would be difficult to describe the surprise and astonishment\r\nexpressed in the countenances of the bystanders on seeing so large a\r\nquantity of cold water heated, and actually made to boil, without any\r\nfire. Though there was, in fact, nothing that could justly be considered\r\nas a surprise in this event, yet I acknowledge fairly that it afforded\r\nme a degree of childish pleasure which, were I ambitious of the\r\nreputation of a GRAVE PHILOSOPHER, I ought most certainly rather to hide\r\nthan to discover....\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus dwelt in detail on these experiments, Rumford comes now to\r\nthe all-important discussion as to the significance of them--the\r\nsubject that had been the source of so much speculation among the\r\nphilosophers--the question as to what heat really is, and if there\r\nreally is any such thing (as many believed) as an igneous fluid, or a\r\nsomething called caloric.\r\n\r\n\"From whence came this heat which was continually given off in this\r\nmanner, in the foregoing experiments?\" asks Rumford. \"Was it furnished\r\nby the small particles of metal detached from the larger solid masses\r\non their being rubbed together? This, as we have already seen, could not\r\npossibly have been the case.\r\n\r\n\"Was it furnished by the air? This could not have been the case; for,\r\nin three of the experiments, the machinery being kept immersed in water,\r\nthe access of the air of the atmosphere was completely prevented.\r\n\r\n\"Was it furnished by the water which surrounded the machinery? That this\r\ncould not have been the case is evident: first, because this water was\r\ncontinually RECEIVING heat from the machinery, and could not, at the\r\nsame time, be GIVING TO and RECEIVING HEAT FROM the same body; and,\r\nsecondly, because there was no chemical decomposition of any part of\r\nthis water. Had any such decomposition taken place (which, indeed, could\r\nnot reasonably have been expected), one of its component elastic fluids\r\n(most probably hydrogen) must, at the same time, have been set at\r\nliberty, and, in making its escape into the atmosphere, would have been\r\ndetected; but, though I frequently examined the water to see if any\r\nair-bubbles rose up through it, and had even made preparations for\r\ncatching them if they should appear, I could perceive none; nor was\r\nthere any sign of decomposition of any kind whatever, or other chemical\r\nprocess, going on in the water.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that the heat could have been supplied by means of the\r\niron bar to the end of which the blunt steel borer was fixed? Or by the\r\nsmall neck of gun-metal by which the hollow cylinder was united to the\r\ncannon? These suppositions seem more improbable even than either of\r\nthe before-mentioned; for heat was continually going off, or OUT OF THE\r\nMACHINERY, by both these passages during the whole time the experiment\r\nlasted.\r\n\r\n\"And in reasoning on this subject we must not forget to consider that\r\nmost remarkable circumstance, that the source of the heat generated by\r\nfriction in these experiments appeared evidently to be INEXHAUSTIBLE.\r\n\r\n\"It is hardly necessary to add that anything which any INSULATED body,\r\nor system of bodies, can continue to furnish WITHOUT LIMITATION cannot\r\npossibly be a MATERIAL substance; and it appears to me to be extremely\r\ndifficult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of\r\nanything capable of being excited and communicated, in the manner\r\nthe heat was excited and communicated in these experiments, except in\r\nMOTION.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS YOUNG AND THE WAVE THEORY OF LIGHT\r\n\r\nBut contemporary judgment, while it listened respectfully to Rumford,\r\nwas little minded to accept his verdict. The cherished beliefs of a\r\ngeneration are not to be put down with a single blow. Where many minds\r\nhave a similar drift, however, the first blow may precipitate a\r\ngeneral conflict; and so it was here. Young Humphry Davy had duplicated\r\nRumford's experiments, and reached similar conclusions; and soon others\r\nfell into line. Then, in 1800, Dr. Thomas Young--\"Phenomenon Young\" they\r\ncalled him at Cambridge, because he was reputed to know everything--took\r\nup the cudgels for the vibratory theory of light, and it began to be\r\nclear that the two \"imponderables,\" heat and light, must stand or\r\nfall together; but no one as yet made a claim against the fluidity of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nBefore we take up the details of the assault made by Young upon the\r\nold doctrine of the materiality of light, we must pause to consider the\r\npersonality of Young himself. For it chanced that this Quaker physician\r\nwas one of those prodigies who come but few times in a century, and\r\nthe full list of whom in the records of history could be told on one's\r\nthumbs and fingers. His biographers tell us things about him that read\r\nlike the most patent fairy-tales. As a mere infant in arms he had been\r\nable to read fluently. Before his fourth birthday came he had read the\r\nBible twice through, as well as Watts's Hymns--poor child!--and when\r\nseven or eight he had shown a propensity to absorb languages much as\r\nother children absorb nursery tattle and Mother Goose rhymes. When\r\nhe was fourteen, a young lady visiting the household of his tutor\r\npatronized the pretty boy by asking to see a specimen of his penmanship.\r\nThe pretty boy complied readily enough, and mildly rebuked his\r\ninterrogator by rapidly writing some sentences for her in fourteen\r\nlanguages, including such as, Arabian, Persian, and Ethiopic.\r\n\r\nMeantime languages had been but an incident in the education of the lad.\r\nHe seems to have entered every available field of thought--mathematics,\r\nphysics, botany, literature, music, painting, languages, philosophy,\r\narchaeology, and so on to tiresome lengths--and once he had entered any\r\nfield he seldom turned aside until he had reached the confines of the\r\nsubject as then known and added something new from the recesses of his\r\nown genius. He was as versatile as Priestley, as profound as Newton\r\nhimself. He had the range of a mere dilettante, but everywhere the full\r\ngrasp of the master. He took early for his motto the saying that what\r\none man has done, another man may do. Granting that the other man has\r\nthe brain of a Thomas Young, it is a true motto.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the young Quaker who came to London to follow out\r\nthe humdrum life of a practitioner of medicine in the year 1801. But\r\nincidentally the young physician was prevailed upon to occupy the\r\ninterims of early practice by fulfilling the duties of the chair of\r\nNatural Philosophy at the Royal Institution, which Count Rumford\r\nhad founded, and of which Davy was then Professor of Chemistry--the\r\ninstitution whose glories have been perpetuated by such names as Faraday\r\nand Tyndall, and which the Briton of to-day speaks of as the \"Pantheon\r\nof Science.\" Here it was that Thomas Young made those studies which have\r\ninsured him a niche in the temple of fame not far removed from that of\r\nIsaac Newton.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1793, when he was only twenty, Young had begun to\r\nCommunicate papers to the Royal Society of London, which were adjudged\r\nworthy to be printed in full in the Philosophical Transactions; so it\r\nis not strange that he should have been asked to deliver the Bakerian\r\nlecture before that learned body the very first year after he came to\r\nLondon. The lecture was delivered November 12, 1801. Its subject was\r\n\"The Theory of Light and Colors,\" and its reading marks an epoch in\r\nphysical science; for here was brought forward for the first time\r\nconvincing proof of that undulatory theory of light with which every\r\nstudent of modern physics is familiar--the theory which holds that light\r\nis not a corporeal entity, but a mere pulsation in the substance of\r\nan all-pervading ether, just as sound is a pulsation in the air, or in\r\nliquids or solids.\r\n\r\nYoung had, indeed, advocated this theory at an earlier date, but it was\r\nnot until 1801 that he hit upon the idea which enabled him to bring it\r\nto anything approaching a demonstration. It was while pondering over the\r\nfamiliar but puzzling phenomena of colored rings into which white\r\nlight is broken when reflected from thin films--Newton's rings, so\r\ncalled--that an explanation occurred to him which at once put the entire\r\nundulatory theory on a new footing. With that sagacity of insight which\r\nwe call genius, he saw of a sudden that the phenomena could be explained\r\nby supposing that when rays of light fall on a thin glass, part of the\r\nrays being reflected from the upper surface, other rays, reflected from\r\nthe lower surface, might be so retarded in their course through the\r\nglass that the two sets would interfere with one another, the forward\r\npulsation of one ray corresponding to the backward pulsation of another,\r\nthus quite neutralizing the effect. Some of the component pulsations of\r\nthe light being thus effaced by mutual interference, the remaining\r\nrays would no longer give the optical effect of white light; hence the\r\npuzzling colors.\r\n\r\nHere is Young's exposition of the subject:\r\n\r\nOf the Colors of Thin Plates\r\n\r\n\"When a beam of light falls upon two refracting surfaces, the partial\r\nreflections coincide perfectly in direction; and in this case the\r\ninterval of retardation taken between the surfaces is to their radius as\r\ntwice the cosine of the angle of refraction to the radius.\r\n\r\n\"Let the medium between the surfaces be rarer than the surrounding\r\nmediums; then the impulse reflected at the second surface, meeting a\r\nsubsequent undulation at the first, will render the particles of the\r\nrarer medium capable of wholly stopping the motion of the denser and\r\ndestroying the reflection, while they themselves will be more strongly\r\npropelled than if they had been at rest, and the transmitted light will\r\nbe increased. So that the colors by reflection will be destroyed, and\r\nthose by transmission rendered more vivid, when the double thickness or\r\nintervals of retardation are any multiples of the whole breadth of\r\nthe undulations; and at intermediate thicknesses the effects will be\r\nreversed according to the Newtonian observation.\r\n\r\n\"If the same proportions be found to hold good with respect to thin\r\nplates of a denser medium, which is, indeed, not improbable, it will be\r\nnecessary to adopt the connected demonstrations of Prop. IV., but, at\r\nany rate, if a thin plate be interposed between a rarer and a denser\r\nmedium, the colors by reflection and transmission may be expected to\r\nchange places.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COLORS OF THICK PLATES\r\n\r\n\"When a beam of light passes through a refracting surface, especially\r\nif imperfectly polished, a portion of it is irregularly scattered, and\r\nmakes the surface visible in all directions, but most conspicuously\r\nin directions not far distant from that of the light itself; and if a\r\nreflecting surface be placed parallel to the refracting surface, this\r\nscattered light, as well as the principal beam, will be reflected, and\r\nthere will be also a new dissipation of light, at the return of the beam\r\nthrough the refracting surface. These two portions of scattered light\r\nwill coincide in direction; and if the surfaces be of such a form as to\r\ncollect the similar effects, will exhibit rings of colors. The interval\r\nof retardation is here the difference between the paths of the principal\r\nbeam and of the scattered light between the two surfaces; of course,\r\nwherever the inclination of the scattered light is equal to that of the\r\nbeam, although in different planes, the interval will vanish and all the\r\nundulations will conspire. At other inclinations, the interval will be\r\nthe difference of the secants from the secant of the inclination, or\r\nangle of refraction of the principal beam. From these causes, all the\r\ncolors of concave mirrors observed by Newton and others are necessary\r\nconsequences; and it appears that their production, though somewhat\r\nsimilar, is by no means as Newton imagined, identical with the\r\nproduction of thin plates.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy following up this clew with mathematical precision, measuring the\r\nexact thickness of the plate and the space between the different rings\r\nof color, Young was able to show mathematically what must be the length\r\nof pulsation for each of the different colors of the spectrum. He\r\nestimated that the undulations of red light, at the extreme lower end\r\nof the visible spectrum, must number about thirty-seven thousand six\r\nhundred and forty to the inch, and pass any given spot at a rate of four\r\nhundred and sixty-three millions of millions of undulations in a second,\r\nwhile the extreme violet numbers fifty-nine thousand seven hundred and\r\nfifty undulations to the inch, or seven hundred and thirty-five millions\r\nof millions to the second.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Colors of Striated Surfaces\r\n\r\nYoung similarly examined the colors that are produced by scratches on\r\na smooth surface, in particular testing the light from \"Mr. Coventry's\r\nexquisite micrometers,\" which consist of lines scratched on glass at\r\nmeasured intervals. These microscopic tests brought the same results as\r\nthe other experiments. The colors were produced at certain definite\r\nand measurable angles, and the theory of interference of undulations\r\nexplained them perfectly, while, as Young affirmed with confidence, no\r\nother hypothesis hitherto advanced would explain them at all. Here are\r\nhis words:\r\n\r\n\"Let there be in a given plane two reflecting points very near each\r\nother, and let the plane be so situated that the reflected image of a\r\nluminous object seen in it may appear to coincide with the points; then\r\nit is obvious that the length of the incident and reflected ray, taken\r\ntogether, is equal with respect to both points, considering them as\r\ncapable of reflecting in all directions. Let one of the points be\r\nnow depressed below the given plane; then the whole path of the\r\nlight reflected from it will be lengthened by a line which is to the\r\ndepression of the point as twice the cosine of incidence to the radius.\r\n\r\n\"If, therefore, equal undulations of given dimensions be reflected\r\nfrom two points, situated near enough to appear to the eye but as one,\r\nwhenever this line is equal to half the breadth of a whole undulation\r\nthe reflection from the depressed point will so interfere with the\r\nreflection from the fixed point that the progressive motion of the one\r\nwill coincide with the retrograde motion of the other, and they will\r\nboth be destroyed; but when this line is equal to the whole breadth of\r\nan undulation, the effect will be doubled, and when to a breadth and\r\na half, again destroyed; and thus for a considerable number of\r\nalternations, and if the reflected undulations be of a different kind,\r\nthey will be variously affected, according to their proportions to the\r\nvarious length of the line which is the difference between the lengths\r\nof their two paths, and which may be denominated the interval of a\r\nretardation.\r\n\r\n\"In order that the effect may be the more perceptible, a number of pairs\r\nof points must be united into two parallel lines; and if several such\r\npairs of lines be placed near each other, they will facilitate the\r\nobservation. If one of the lines be made to revolve round the other as\r\nan axis, the depression below the given plane will be as the sine of the\r\ninclination; and while the eye and the luminous object remain fixed the\r\ndifference of the length of the paths will vary as this sine.\r\n\r\n\"The best subjects for the experiment are Mr. Coventry's exquisite\r\nmicrometers; such of them as consist of parallel lines drawn on glass,\r\nat a distance of one-five-hundredth of an inch, are the most convenient.\r\nEach of these lines appears under a microscope to consist of two or more\r\nfiner lines, exactly parallel, and at a distance of somewhat more than\r\na twentieth more than the adjacent lines. I placed one of these so as to\r\nreflect the sun's light at an angle of forty-five degrees, and fixed\r\nit in such a manner that while it revolved round one of the lines as an\r\naxis, I could measure its angular motion; I found that the longest red\r\ncolor occurred at the inclination 10 1/4 degrees, 20 3/4 degrees, 32\r\ndegrees, and 45 degrees; of which the sines are as the numbers 1, 2, 3,\r\nand 4. At all other angles also, when the sun's light was reflected from\r\nthe surface, the color vanished with the inclination, and was equal at\r\nequal inclinations on either side.\r\n\r\nThis experiment affords a very strong confirmation of the theory. It is\r\nimpossible to deduce any explanation of it from any hypothesis hitherto\r\nadvanced; and I believe it would be difficult to invent any other\r\nthat would account for it. There is a striking analogy between this\r\nseparation of colors and the production of a musical note by successive\r\nechoes from equidistant iron palisades, which I have found to correspond\r\npretty accurately with the known velocity of sound and the distances of\r\nthe surfaces.\r\n\r\n\"It is not improbable that the colors of the integuments of some\r\ninsects, and of some other natural bodies, exhibiting in different\r\nlights the most beautiful versatility, may be found to be of this\r\ndescription, and not to be derived from thin plates. In some cases a\r\nsingle scratch or furrow may produce similar effects, by the reflection\r\nof its opposite edges.\"(3)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of interference of undulations was the absolutely novel\r\npart of Young's theory. The all-compassing genius of Robert Hooke had,\r\nindeed, very nearly apprehended it more than a century before, as Young\r\nhimself points out, but no one else bad so much as vaguely conceived\r\nit; and even with the sagacious Hooke it was only a happy guess, never\r\ndistinctly outlined in his own mind, and utterly ignored by all\r\nothers. Young did not know of Hooke's guess until he himself had fully\r\nformulated the theory, but he hastened then to give his predecessor\r\nall the credit that could possibly be adjudged his due by the most\r\ndisinterested observer. To Hooke's contemporary, Huygens, who was the\r\noriginator of the general doctrine of undulation as the explanation of\r\nlight, Young renders full justice also. For himself he claims only the\r\nmerit of having demonstrated the theory which these and a few others of\r\nhis predecessors had advocated without full proof.\r\n\r\nThe following year Dr. Young detailed before the Royal Society\r\nother experiments, which threw additional light on the doctrine of\r\ninterference; and in 1803 he cited still others, which, he affirmed,\r\nbrought the doctrine to complete demonstration. In applying this\r\ndemonstration to the general theory of light, he made the striking\r\nsuggestion that \"the luminiferous ether pervades the substance of all\r\nmaterial bodies with little or no resistance, as freely, perhaps, as the\r\nwind passes through a grove of trees.\" He asserted his belief also that\r\nthe chemical rays which Ritter had discovered beyond the violet end of\r\nthe visible spectrum are but still more rapid undulations of the same\r\ncharacter as those which produce light. In his earlier lecture he had\r\naffirmed a like affinity between the light rays and the rays of\r\nradiant heat which Herschel detected below the red end of the spectrum,\r\nsuggesting that \"light differs from heat only in the frequency of its\r\nundulations or vibrations--those undulations which are within certain\r\nlimits with respect to frequency affecting the optic nerve and\r\nconstituting light, and those which are slower and probably stronger\r\nconstituting heat only.\" From the very outset he had recognized the\r\naffinity between sound and light; indeed, it had been this affinity that\r\nled him on to an appreciation of the undulatory theory of light.\r\n\r\nBut while all these affinities seemed so clear to the great\r\nco-ordinating brain of Young, they made no such impression on the minds\r\nof his contemporaries. The immateriality of light had been substantially\r\ndemonstrated, but practically no one save its author accepted the\r\ndemonstration. Newton's doctrine of the emission of corpuscles was too\r\nfirmly rooted to be readily dislodged, and Dr. Young had too many other\r\ninterests to continue the assault unceasingly. He occasionally wrote\r\nsomething touching on his theory, mostly papers contributed to\r\nthe Quarterly Review and similar periodicals, anonymously or\r\nunder pseudonym, for he had conceived the notion that too great\r\nconspicuousness in fields outside of medicine would injure his practice\r\nas a physician. His views regarding light (including the original papers\r\nfrom the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society) were again\r\ngiven publicity in full in his celebrated volume on natural philosophy,\r\nconsisting in part of his lectures before the Royal Institution,\r\npublished in 1807; but even then they failed to bring conviction to\r\nthe philosophic world. Indeed, they did not even arouse a controversial\r\nspirit, as his first papers had done.\r\n\r\n\r\nARAGO AND FRESNEL CHAMPION THE WAVE THEORY\r\n\r\nSo it chanced that when, in 1815, a young French military engineer,\r\nnamed Augustin Jean Fresnel, returning from the Napoleonic wars,\r\nbecame interested in the phenomena of light, and made some experiments\r\nconcerning diffraction which seemed to him to controvert the accepted\r\nnotions of the materiality of light, he was quite unaware that his\r\nexperiments had been anticipated by a philosopher across the Channel.\r\nHe communicated his experiments and results to the French Institute,\r\nsupposing them to be absolutely novel. That body referred them to a\r\ncommittee, of which, as good fortune would have it, the dominating\r\nmember was Dominique Francois Arago, a man as versatile as Young\r\nhimself, and hardly less profound, if perhaps not quite so original.\r\nArago at once recognized the merit of Fresnel's work, and soon became a\r\nconvert to the theory. He told Fresnel that Young had anticipated him\r\nas regards the general theory, but that much remained to be done, and\r\nhe offered to associate himself with Fresnel in prosecuting the\r\ninvestigation. Fresnel was not a little dashed to learn that his\r\noriginal ideas had been worked out by another while he was a lad, but he\r\nbowed gracefully to the situation and went ahead with unabated zeal.\r\n\r\nThe championship of Arago insured the undulatory theory a hearing\r\nbefore the French Institute, but by no means sufficed to bring about\r\nits general acceptance. On the contrary, a bitter feud ensued, in which\r\nArago was opposed by the \"Jupiter Olympus of the Academy,\" Laplace, by\r\nthe only less famous Poisson, and by the younger but hardly less able\r\nBiot. So bitterly raged the feud that a life-long friendship between\r\nArago and Biot was ruptured forever. The opposition managed to delay the\r\npublication of Fresnel's papers, but Arago continued to fight with his\r\ncustomary enthusiasm and pertinacity, and at last, in 1823, the Academy\r\nyielded, and voted Fresnel into its ranks, thus implicitly admitting the\r\nvalue of his work.\r\n\r\nIt is a humiliating thought that such controversies as this must mar\r\nthe progress of scientific truth; but fortunately the story of the\r\nintroduction of the undulatory theory has a more pleasant side. Three\r\nmen, great both in character and in intellect, were concerned in\r\npressing its claims--Young, Fresnel, and Arago--and the relations of\r\nthese men form a picture unmarred by any of those petty jealousies that\r\nso often dim the lustre of great names. Fresnel freely acknowledged\r\nYoung's priority so soon as his attention was called to it; and Young\r\napplauded the work of the Frenchman, and aided with his counsel in the\r\napplication of the undulatory theory to the problems of polarization of\r\nlight, which still demanded explanation, and which Fresnel's fertility\r\nof experimental resource and profundity of mathematical insight sufficed\r\nin the end to conquer.\r\n\r\nAfter Fresnel's admission to the Institute in 1823 the opposition\r\nweakened, and gradually the philosophers came to realize the merits of\r\na theory which Young had vainly called to their attention a full\r\nquarter-century before. Now, thanks largely to Arago, both Young and\r\nFresnel received their full meed of appreciation. Fresnel was given the\r\nRumford medal of the Royal Society of England in 1825, and chosen one of\r\nthe foreign members of the society two years later, while Young in turn\r\nwas elected one of the eight foreign members of the French Academy. As\r\na fitting culmination of the chapter of felicities between the three\r\nfriends, it fell to the lot of Young, as Foreign Secretary of the\r\nRoyal Society, to notify Fresnel of the honors shown him by England's\r\nrepresentative body of scientists; while Arago, as Perpetual Secretary\r\nof the French Institute, conveyed to Young in the same year the\r\nnotification that he had been similarly honored by the savants of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nA few months later Fresnel was dead, and Young survived him only two\r\nyears. Both died prematurely, but their great work was done, and\r\nthe world will remember always and link together these two names in\r\nconnection with a theory which in its implications and importance ranks\r\nlittle below the theory of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\r\n\r\nGALVANI AND VOLTA\r\n\r\nThe full importance of Young's studies of light might perhaps have\r\ngained earlier recognition had it not chanced that, at the time when\r\nthey were made, the attention of the philosophic world was turned with\r\nthe fixity and fascination of a hypnotic stare upon another field, which\r\nfor a time brooked no rival. How could the old, familiar phenomenon,\r\nlight, interest any one when the new agent, galvanism, was in view? As\r\nwell ask one to fix attention on a star while a meteorite blazes across\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nGalvanism was so called precisely as the Roentgen ray was christened at\r\na later day--as a safe means of begging the question as to the nature of\r\nthe phenomena involved. The initial fact in galvanism was the discovery\r\nof Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), a physician of Bologna, in 1791, that\r\nby bringing metals in contact with the nerves of a frog's leg violent\r\nmuscular contractions are produced. As this simple little experiment led\r\neventually to the discovery of galvanic electricity and the invention\r\nof the galvanic battery, it may be regarded as the beginning of modern\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe story is told that Galvani was led to his discovery while preparing\r\nfrogs' legs to make a broth for his invalid wife. As the story runs, he\r\nhad removed the skins from several frogs' legs, when, happening to touch\r\nthe exposed muscles with a scalpel which had lain in close proximity to\r\nan electrical machine, violent muscular action was produced. Impressed\r\nwith this phenomenon, he began a series of experiments which finally\r\nresulted in his great discovery. But be this story authentic or not, it\r\nis certain that Galvani experimented for several years upon frogs' legs\r\nsuspended upon wires and hooks, until he finally constructed his arc\r\nof two different metals, which, when arranged so that one was placed\r\nin contact with a nerve and the other with a muscle, produced violent\r\ncontractions.\r\n\r\nThese two pieces of metal form the basic principle of the modern\r\ngalvanic battery, and led directly to Alessandro Volta's invention\r\nof his \"voltaic pile,\" the immediate ancestor of the modern galvanic\r\nbattery. Volta's experiments were carried on at the same time as those\r\nof Galvani, and his invention of his pile followed close upon Galvani's\r\ndiscovery of the new form of electricity. From these facts the new form\r\nof electricity was sometimes called \"galvanic\" and sometimes \"voltaic\"\r\nelectricity, but in recent years the term \"galvanism\" and \"galvanic\r\ncurrent\" have almost entirely supplanted the use of the term voltaic.\r\n\r\nIt was Volta who made the report of Galvani's wonderful discovery to\r\nthe Royal Society of London, read on January 31, 1793. In this letter he\r\ndescribes Galvani's experiments in detail and refers to them in glowing\r\nterms of praise. He calls it one of the \"most beautiful and important\r\ndiscoveries,\" and regarded it as the germ or foundation upon which other\r\ndiscoveries were to be made. The prediction proved entirely correct,\r\nVolta himself being the chief discoverer.\r\n\r\nWorking along lines suggested by Galvani's discovery, Volta constructed\r\nan apparatus made up of a number of disks of two different kinds of\r\nmetal, such as tin and silver, arranged alternately, a piece of some\r\nmoist, porous substance, like paper or felt, being interposed between\r\neach pair of disks. With this \"pile,\" as it was called, electricity\r\nwas generated, and by linking together several such piles an electric\r\nbattery could be formed.\r\n\r\nThis invention took the world by storm. Nothing like the enthusiasm it\r\ncreated in the philosophic world had been known since the invention\r\nof the Leyden jar, more than half a century before. Within a few weeks\r\nafter Volta's announcement, batteries made according to his plan were\r\nbeing experimented with in every important laboratory in Europe.\r\n\r\nAs the century closed, half the philosophic world was speculating as to\r\nwhether \"galvanic influence\" were a new imponderable, or only a form of\r\nelectricity; and the other half was eagerly seeking to discover what new\r\nmarvels the battery might reveal. The least imaginative man could see\r\nthat here was an invention that would be epoch-making, but the most\r\nvisionary dreamer could not even vaguely adumbrate the real measure of\r\nits importance.\r\n\r\nIt was evident at once that almost any form of galvanic battery,\r\ndespite imperfections, was a more satisfactory instrument for generating\r\nelectricity than the frictional machine hitherto in use, the advantage\r\nlying in the fact that the current from the galvanic battery could\r\nbe controlled practically at will, and that the apparatus itself\r\nwas inexpensive and required comparatively little attention. These\r\nadvantages were soon made apparent by the practical application of the\r\nelectric current in several fields.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that despite the energetic endeavors of such\r\nphilosophers as Watson, Franklin, Galvani, and many others, the field\r\nof practical application of electricity was very limited at the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century. The lightning-rod had come into general use, to\r\nbe sure, and its value as an invention can hardly be overestimated. But\r\nwhile it was the result of extensive electrical discoveries, and is\r\na most practical instrument, it can hardly be called one that puts\r\nelectricity to practical use, but simply acts as a means of warding\r\noff the evil effects of a natural manifestation of electricity. The\r\ninvention, however, had all the effects of a mechanism which turned\r\nelectricity to practical account. But with the advent of the new kind of\r\nelectricity the age of practical application began.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVY AND ELECTRIC LIGHT\r\n\r\nVolta's announcement of his pile was scarcely two months old when two\r\nEnglishmen, Messrs. Nicholson and Carlisle, made the discovery that\r\nthe current from the galvanic battery had a decided effect upon certain\r\nchemicals, among other things decomposing water into its elements,\r\nhydrogen and oxygen. On May 7, 1800, these investigators arranged the\r\nends of two brass wires connected with the poles of a voltaic pile,\r\ncomposed of alternate silver and zinc plates, so that the current coming\r\nfrom the pile was discharged through a small quantity of \"New River\r\nwater.\" \"A fine stream of minute bubbles immediately began to flow from\r\nthe point of the lower wire in the tube which communicated with the\r\nsilver,\" wrote Nicholson, \"and the opposite point of the upper wire\r\nbecame tarnished, first deep orange and then black....\" The product of\r\ngas during two hours and a half was two-thirtieths of a cubic inch.\r\n\"It was then mixed with an equal quantity of common air,\" continues\r\nNicholson, \"and exploded by the application of a lighted waxen thread.\"\r\n\r\nThis demonstration was the beginning of the very important science of\r\nelectro-chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this discovery was at once recognized by Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, who began experimenting immediately in this new field. He\r\nconstructed a series of batteries in various combinations, with which\r\nhe attacked the \"fixed alkalies,\" the composition of which was then\r\nunknown. Very shortly he was able to decompose potash into bright\r\nmetallic globules, resembling quicksilver. This new substance he named\r\n\"potassium.\" Then in rapid succession the elementary substances sodium,\r\ncalcium, strontium, and magnesium were isolated.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered, also, that the new electricity, like the old,\r\npossessed heating power under certain conditions, even to the fusing of\r\npieces of wire. This observation was probably first made by Frommsdorff,\r\nbut it was elaborated by Davy, who constructed a battery of two thousand\r\ncells with which he produced a bright light from points of carbon--the\r\nprototype of the modern arc lamp. He made this demonstration before the\r\nmembers of the Royal Institution in 1810. But the practical utility of\r\nsuch a light for illuminating purposes was still a thing of the future.\r\nThe expense of constructing and maintaining such an elaborate battery,\r\nand the rapid internal destruction of its plates, together with the\r\nconstant polarization, rendered its use in practical illumination out of\r\nthe question. It was not until another method of generating electricity\r\nwas discovered that Davy's demonstration could be turned to practical\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIn Davy's own account of his experiment he says:\r\n\r\n\"When pieces of charcoal about an inch long and one-sixth of an inch in\r\ndiameter were brought near each other (within the thirtieth or fortieth\r\nof an inch), a bright spark was produced, and more than half the volume\r\nof the charcoal became ignited to whiteness; and, by withdrawing the\r\npoints from each other, a constant discharge took place through the\r\nheated air, in a space equal to at least four inches, producing a most\r\nbrilliant ascending arch of light, broad and conical in form in the\r\nmiddle. When any substance was introduced into this arch, it instantly\r\nbecame ignited; platina melted as readily in it as wax in a common\r\ncandle; quartz, the sapphire, magnesia, lime, all entered into fusion;\r\nfragments of diamond and points of charcoal and plumbago seemed to\r\nevaporate in it, even when the connection was made in the receiver of an\r\nair-pump; but there was no evidence of their having previously undergone\r\nfusion. When the communication between the points positively and\r\nnegatively electrified was made in the air rarefied in the receiver of\r\nthe air-pump, the distance at which the discharge took place increased\r\nas the exhaustion was made; and when the atmosphere in the vessel\r\nsupported only one-fourth of an inch of mercury in the barometrical\r\ngauge, the sparks passed through a space of nearly half an inch; and, by\r\nwithdrawing the points from each other, the discharge was made through\r\nsix or seven inches, producing a most brilliant coruscation of purple\r\nlight; the charcoal became intensely ignited, and some platina wire\r\nattached to it fused with brilliant scintillations and fell in large\r\nglobules upon the plate of the pump. All the phenomena of\r\nchemical decomposition were produced with intense rapidity by this\r\ncombination.\"(1)\r\n\r\nBut this experiment demonstrated another thing besides the possibility\r\nof producing electric light and chemical decomposition, this being the\r\nheating power capable of being produced by the electric current. Thus\r\nDavy's experiment of fusing substances laid the foundation of the modern\r\nelectric furnaces, which are of paramount importance in several great\r\ncommercial industries.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the results obtained with Davy's batteries were\r\npractically as satisfactory as could be obtained with modern cell\r\nbatteries, the batteries themselves were anything but satisfactory. They\r\nwere expensive, required constant care and attention, and, what was more\r\nimportant from an experimental standpoint at least, were not constant in\r\ntheir action except for a very limited period of time, the current soon\r\n\"running down.\" Numerous experimenters, therefore, set about devising a\r\nsatisfactory battery, and when, in 1836, John Frederick Daniell produced\r\nthe cell that bears his name, his invention was epoch-making in the\r\nhistory of electrical progress. The Royal Society considered it of\r\nsufficient importance to bestow the Copley medal upon the inventor,\r\nwhose device is the direct parent of all modern galvanic cells. From the\r\ntime of the advent of the Daniell cell experiments in electricity were\r\nrendered comparatively easy. In the mean while, however, another great\r\ndiscovery was made.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM\r\n\r\nFor many years there had been a growing suspicion, amounting in\r\nmany instances to belief in the close relationship existing between\r\nelectricity and magnetism. Before the winter of 1815, however, it was\r\na belief that was surmised but not demonstrated. But in that year it\r\noccurred to Jean Christian Oersted, of Denmark, to pass a current of\r\nelectricity through a wire held parallel with, but not quite touching, a\r\nsuspended magnetic needle. The needle was instantly deflected and swung\r\nout of its position.\r\n\r\n\"The first experiments in connection with the subject which I am\r\nundertaking to explain,\" wrote Oersted, \"were made during the course\r\nof lectures which I held last winter on electricity and magnetism. From\r\nthose experiments it appeared that the magnetic needle could be moved\r\nfrom its position by means of a galvanic battery--one with a closed\r\ngalvanic circuit. Since, however, those experiments were made with an\r\napparatus of small power, I undertook to repeat and increase them with a\r\nlarge galvanic battery.\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose that the two opposite ends of the galvanic apparatus are\r\njoined by a metal wire. This I shall always call the conductor for\r\nthe sake of brevity. Place a rectilinear piece of this conductor in\r\na horizontal position over an ordinary magnetic needle so that it is\r\nparallel to it. The magnetic needle will be set in motion and will\r\ndeviate towards the west under that part of the conductor which comes\r\nfrom the negative pole of the galvanic battery. If the wire is not more\r\nthan four-fifths of an inch distant from the middle of this needle, this\r\ndeviation will be about forty-five degrees. At a greater distance\r\nthe angle of deviation becomes less. Moreover, the deviation varies\r\naccording to the strength of the battery. The conductor can be moved\r\ntowards the east or west, so long as it remains parallel to the needle,\r\nwithout producing any other result than to make the deviation smaller.\r\n\r\n\"The conductor can consist of several combined wires or metal coils. The\r\nnature of the metal does not alter the result except, perhaps, to make\r\nit greater or less. We have used wires of platinum, gold, silver, brass,\r\nand iron, and coils of lead, tin, and quicksilver with the same result.\r\nIf the conductor is interrupted by water, all effect is not cut off,\r\nunless the stretch of water is several inches long.\r\n\r\n\"The conductor works on the magnetic needle through glass, metals, wood,\r\nwater, and resin, through clay vessels and through stone, for when we\r\nplaced a glass plate, a metal plate, or a board between the conductor\r\nand the needle the effect was not cut off; even the three together\r\nseemed hardly to weaken the effect, and the same was the case with an\r\nearthen vessel, even when it was full of water. Our experiments also\r\ndemonstrated that the said effects were not altered when we used a\r\nmagnetic needle which was in a brass case full of water.\r\n\r\n\"When the conductor is placed in a horizontal plane under the magnetic\r\nneedle all the effects we have described take place in precisely the\r\nsame way, but in the opposite direction to what took place when the\r\nconductor was in a horizontal plane above the needle.\r\n\r\n\"If the conductor is moved in a horizontal plane so that it gradually\r\nmakes ever-increasing angles with the magnetic meridian, the deviation\r\nof the magnetic needle from the magnetic meridian is increased when the\r\nwire is turned towards the place of the needle; it decreases, on the\r\nother hand, when it is turned away from that place.\r\n\r\n\"A needle of brass which is hung in the same way as the magnetic needle\r\nis not set in motion by the influence of the conductor. A needle of\r\nglass or rubber likewise remains static under similar experiments. Hence\r\nthe electrical conductor affects only the magnetic parts of a substance.\r\nThat the electrical current is not confined to the conducting wire,\r\nbut is comparatively widely diffused in the surrounding space, is\r\nsufficiently demonstrated from the foregoing observations.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of Oersted's demonstration is almost incomprehensible. By it\r\nwas shown the close relationship between magnetism and electricity. It\r\nshowed the way to the establishment of the science of electrodynamics;\r\nalthough it was by the French savant Andre Marie Ampere (1775-1836) that\r\nthe science was actually created, and this within the space of one week\r\nafter hearing of Oersted's experiment in deflecting the needle. Ampere\r\nfirst received the news of Oersted's experiment on September 11, 1820,\r\nand on the 18th of the same month he announced to the Academy the\r\nfundamental principles of the science of electro-dynamics--seven days of\r\nrapid progress perhaps unequalled in the history of science.\r\n\r\nAmpere's distinguished countryman, Arago, a few months later, gave\r\nthe finishing touches to Oersted's and Ampere's discoveries, by\r\ndemonstrating conclusively that electricity not only influenced a\r\nmagnet, but actually produced magnetism under proper circumstances--a\r\ncomplemental fact most essential in practical mechanics.\r\n\r\nSome four years after Arago's discovery, Sturgeon made the first\r\n\"electro-magnet\" by winding a soft iron core with wire through which\r\na current of electricity was passed. This study of electro-magnets was\r\ntaken up by Professor Joseph Henry, of Albany, New York, who succeeded\r\nin making magnets of enormous lifting power by winding the iron core\r\nwith several coils of wire. One of these magnets, excited by a single\r\ngalvanic cell of less than half a square foot of surface, and containing\r\nonly half a pint of dilute acids, sustained a weight of six hundred and\r\nfifty pounds.\r\n\r\nThus by Oersted's great discovery of the intimate relationship of\r\nmagnetism and electricity, with further elaborations and discoveries by\r\nAmpere, Volta, and Henry, and with the invention of Daniell's cell, the\r\nway was laid for putting electricity to practical use. Soon followed the\r\ninvention and perfection of the electro-magnetic telegraph and a host of\r\nother but little less important devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nFARADAY AND ELECTRO-MAGNETIC INDUCTION\r\n\r\nWith these great discoveries and inventions at hand, electricity became\r\nno longer a toy or a \"plaything for philosophers,\" but of enormous\r\nand growing importance commercially. Still, electricity generated\r\nby chemical action, even in a very perfect cell, was both feeble and\r\nexpensive, and, withal, only applicable in a comparatively limited\r\nfield. Another important scientific discovery was necessary before such\r\nthings as electric traction and electric lighting on a large scale were\r\nto become possible; but that discovery was soon made by Sir Michael\r\nFaraday.\r\n\r\nFaraday, the son of a blacksmith and a bookbinder by trade, had\r\ninterested Sir Humphry Davy by his admirable notes on four of Davy's\r\nlectures, which he had been able to attend. Although advised by the\r\ngreat scientist to \"stick to his bookbinding\" rather than enter the\r\nfield of science, Faraday became, at twenty-two years of age, Davy's\r\nassistant in the Royal Institution. There, for several years, he devoted\r\nall his spare hours to scientific investigations and experiments,\r\nperfecting himself in scientific technique.\r\n\r\nA few years later he became interested, like all the scientists of\r\nthe time, in Arago's experiment of rotating a copper disk underneath a\r\nsuspended compass-needle. When this disk was rotated rapidly, the\r\nneedle was deflected, or even rotated about its axis, in a manner quite\r\ninexplicable. Faraday at once conceived the idea that the cause of this\r\nrotation was due to electricity, induced in the revolving disk--not only\r\nconceived it, but put his belief in writing. For several years, however,\r\nhe was unable to demonstrate the truth of his assumption, although he\r\nmade repeated experiments to prove it. But in 1831 he began a series\r\nof experiments that established forever the fact of electro-magnetic\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\nIn his famous paper, read before the Royal Society in 1831, Faraday\r\ndescribes the method by which he first demonstrated electro-magnetic\r\ninduction, and then explained the phenomenon of Arago's revolving disk.\r\n\r\n\"About twenty-six feet of copper wire, one-twentieth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, were wound round a cylinder of wood as a helix,\" he said,\r\n\"the different spires of which were prevented from touching by a thin\r\ninterposed twine. This helix was covered with calico, and then a\r\nsecond wire applied in the same manner. In this way twelve helices were\r\n\"superposed, each containing an average length of wire of twenty-seven\r\nfeet, and all in the same direction. The first, third, fifth, seventh,\r\nninth, and eleventh of these helices were connected at their extremities\r\nend to end so as to form one helix; the others were connected in a\r\nsimilar manner; and thus two principal helices were produced, closely\r\ninterposed, having the same direction, not touching anywhere, and each\r\ncontaining one hundred and fifty-five feet in length of wire.\r\n\r\nOne of these helices was connected with a galvanometer, the other with\r\na voltaic battery of ten pairs of plates four inches square, with double\r\ncoppers and well charged; yet not the slightest sensible deflection of\r\nthe galvanometer needle could be observed.\r\n\r\n\"A similar compound helix, consisting of six lengths of copper and six\r\nof soft iron wire, was constructed. The resulting iron helix contained\r\ntwo hundred and eight feet; but whether the current from the trough was\r\npassed through the copper or the iron helix, no effect upon the other\r\ncould be perceived at the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n\"In these and many similar experiments no difference in action of any\r\nkind appeared between iron and other metals.\r\n\r\n\"Two hundred and three feet of copper wire in one length were passed\r\nround a large block of wood; other two hundred and three feet of similar\r\nwire were interposed as a spiral between the turns of the first, and\r\nmetallic contact everywhere prevented by twine. One of these helices was\r\nconnected with a galvanometer and the other with a battery of a hundred\r\npairs of plates four inches square, with double coppers and well\r\ncharged. When the contact was made, there was a sudden and very slight\r\neffect at the galvanometer, and there was also a similar slight effect\r\nwhen the contact with the battery was broken. But whilst the voltaic\r\ncurrent was continuing to pass through the one helix, no galvanometrical\r\nappearances of any effect like induction upon the other helix could be\r\nperceived, although the active power of the battery was proved to be\r\ngreat by its heating the whole of its own helix, and by the brilliancy\r\nof the discharge when made through charcoal.\r\n\r\n\"Repetition of the experiments with a battery of one hundred and twenty\r\npairs of plates produced no other effects; but it was ascertained, both\r\nat this and at the former time, that the slight deflection of the needle\r\noccurring at the moment of completing the connection was always in one\r\ndirection, and that the equally slight deflection produced when the\r\ncontact was broken was in the other direction; and, also, that these\r\neffects occurred when the first helices were used.\r\n\r\n\"The results which I had by this time obtained with magnets led me\r\nto believe that the battery current through one wire did, in reality,\r\ninduce a similar current through the other wire, but that it continued\r\nfor an instant only, and partook more of the nature of the electrical\r\nwave passed through from the shock of a common Leyden jar than of that\r\nfrom a voltaic battery, and, therefore, might magnetize a steel needle\r\nalthough it scarcely affected the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n\"This expectation was confirmed; for on substituting a small hollow\r\nhelix, formed round a glass tube, for the galvanometer, introducing\r\na steel needle, making contact as before between the battery and the\r\ninducing wire, and then removing the needle before the battery contact\r\nwas broken, it was found magnetized.\r\n\r\n\"When the battery contact was first made, then an unmagnetized needle\r\nintroduced, and lastly the battery contact broken, the needle was found\r\nmagnetized to an equal degree apparently with the first; but the poles\r\nwere of the contrary kinds.\"(3)\r\n\r\nTo Faraday these experiments explained the phenomenon of Arago's\r\nrotating disk, the disk inducing the current from the magnet, and, in\r\nreacting, deflecting the needle. To prove this, he constructed a disk\r\nthat revolved between the poles of an electro-magnet, connecting the\r\naxis and the edge of the disk with a galvanometer. \"... A disk of\r\ncopper, twelve inches in diameter, fixed upon a brass axis,\" he says,\r\n\"was mounted in frames so as to be revolved either vertically or\r\nhorizontally, its edge being at the same time introduced more or less\r\nbetween the magnetic poles. The edge of the plate was well amalgamated\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining good but movable contact; a part round the\r\naxis was also prepared in a similar manner.\r\n\r\n\"Conductors or collectors of copper and lead were constructed so as to\r\ncome in contact with the edge of the copper disk, or with other forms\r\nof plates hereafter to be described. These conductors we're about four\r\ninches long, one-third of an inch wide, and one-fifth of an inch thick;\r\none end of each was slightly grooved, to allow of more exact adaptation\r\nto the somewhat convex edge of the plates, and then amalgamated. Copper\r\nwires, one-sixteenth of an inch in thickness, attached in the ordinary\r\nmanner by convolutions to the other ends of these conductors, passed\r\naway to the galvanometer.\r\n\r\n\"All these arrangements being made, the copper disk was adjusted, the\r\nsmall magnetic poles being about one-half an inch apart, and the edge\r\nof the plate inserted about half their width between them. One of the\r\ngalvanometer wires was passed twice or thrice loosely round the brass\r\naxis of the plate, and the other attached to a conductor, which itself\r\nwas retained by the hand in contact with the amalgamated edge of the\r\ndisk at the part immediately between the magnetic poles. Under these\r\ncircumstances all was quiescent, and the galvanometer exhibited no\r\neffect. But the instant the plate moved the galvanometer was influenced,\r\nand by revolving the plate quickly the needle could be deflected ninety\r\ndegrees or more.\"(4)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rotating disk was really a dynamo electric machine in miniature,\r\nthe first ever constructed, but whose direct descendants are the\r\nordinary dynamos. Modern dynamos range in power from little machines\r\noperating machinery requiring only fractions of a horsepower to great\r\ndynamos operating street-car lines and lighting cities; but all\r\nare built on the same principle as Faraday's rotating disk. By this\r\ndiscovery the use of electricity as a practical and economical motive\r\npower became possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORAGE BATTERIES\r\n\r\nWhen the discoveries of Faraday of electro-magnetic induction had made\r\npossible the means of easily generating electricity, the next natural\r\nstep was to find a means of storing it or accumulating it. This,\r\nhowever, proved no easy matter, and as yet a practical storage or\r\nsecondary battery that is neither too cumbersome, too fragile, nor too\r\nweak in its action has not been invented. If a satisfactory storage\r\nbattery could be made, it is obvious that its revolutionary effects\r\ncould scarcely be overestimated. In the single field of aeronautics, it\r\nwould probably solve the question of aerial navigation. Little wonder,\r\nthen, that inventors have sought so eagerly for the invention of\r\nsatisfactory storage batteries. As early as 1803 Ritter had attempted to\r\nmake such a secondary battery. In 1843 Grove also attempted it. But it\r\nwas not until 1859, when Gaston Planche produced his invention, that\r\nanything like a reasonably satisfactory storage battery was made.\r\nPlanche discovered that sheets of lead immersed in dilute sulphuric acid\r\nwere very satisfactory for the production of polarization effects. He\r\nconstructed a battery of sheets of lead immersed in sulphuric acid, and,\r\nafter charging these for several hours from the cells of an ordinary\r\nBunsen battery, was able to get currents of great strength and\r\nconsiderable duration. This battery, however, from its construction of\r\nlead, was necessarily heavy and cumbersome. Faure improved it somewhat\r\nby coating the lead plates with red-lead, thus increasing the capacity\r\nof the cell. Faure's invention gave a fresh impetus to inventors, and\r\nshortly after the market was filled with storage batteries of various\r\nkinds, most of them modifications of Planche's or Faure's. The ardor\r\nof enthusiastic inventors soon flagged, however, for all these storage\r\nbatteries proved of little practical account in the end, as compared\r\nwith other known methods of generating power.\r\n\r\nThree methods of generating electricity are in general use: static or\r\nfrictional electricity is generated by \"plate\" or \"static\" machines;\r\ngalvanic, generated by batteries based on Volta's discovery; and\r\ninduced, or faradic, generated either by chemical or mechanical action.\r\nThere is still another kind, thermo-electricity, that may be generated\r\nin a most simple manner. In 1821 Seebecle, of Berlin, discovered that\r\nwhen a circuit was formed of two wires of different metals, if there\r\nbe a difference in temperature at the juncture of these two metals\r\nan electrical current will be established. In this way heat may\r\nbe transmitted directly into the energy of the current without the\r\ninterposition of the steam-engine. Batteries constructed in this way\r\nare of low resistance, however, although by arranging several of them\r\nin \"series,\" currents of considerable strength can be generated. As yet,\r\nhowever, they are of little practical importance.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century Clerk-Maxwell advanced the idea that\r\nlight waves were really electro-magnetic waves. If this were true and\r\nlight proved to be simply one form of electrical energy, then the same\r\nwould be true of radiant heat. Maxwell advanced this theory, but failed\r\nto substantiate it by experimental confirmation. But Dr. Heinrich\r\nHertz, a few years later, by a series of experiments, demonstrated the\r\ncorrectness of Maxwell's surmises. What are now called \"Hertzian waves\"\r\nare waves apparently identical with light waves, but of much lower\r\npitch or period. In his experiments Hertz showed that, under proper\r\nconditions, electric sparks between polished balls were attended by\r\nether waves of the same nature as those of light, but of a pitch of\r\nseveral millions of vibrations per second. These waves could be dealt\r\nwith as if they were light waves--reflected, refracted, and polarized.\r\nThese are the waves that are utilized in wireless telegraphy.\r\n\r\n\r\nROENTGEN RAYS, OR X-RAYS\r\n\r\nIn December of 1895 word came out of Germany of a scientific discovery\r\nthat startled the world. It came first as a rumor, little credited; then\r\nas a pronounced report; at last as a demonstration. It told of a new\r\nmanifestation of energy, in virtue of which the interior of opaque\r\nobjects is made visible to human eyes. One had only to look into a tube\r\ncontaining a screen of a certain composition, and directed towards\r\na peculiar electrical apparatus, to acquire clairvoyant vision more\r\nwonderful than the discredited second-sight of the medium. Coins within\r\na purse, nails driven into wood, spectacles within a leather case,\r\nbecame clearly visible when subjected to the influence of this magic\r\ntube; and when a human hand was held before the tube, its bones stood\r\nrevealed in weird simplicity, as if the living, palpitating flesh about\r\nthem were but the shadowy substance of a ghost.\r\n\r\nNot only could the human eye see these astounding revelations, but the\r\nimpartial evidence of inanimate chemicals could be brought forward to\r\nprove that the mind harbored no illusion. The photographic film recorded\r\nthe things that the eye might see, and ghostly pictures galore soon gave\r\na quietus to the doubts of the most sceptical. Within a month of the\r\nannouncement of Professor Roentgen's experiments comment upon the\r\n\"X-ray\" and the \"new photography\" had become a part of the current\r\ngossip of all Christendom.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that such a revolutionary thing as the\r\ndiscovery of a process whereby opaque objects became transparent, or\r\ntranslucent, was not achieved at a single bound with no intermediate\r\ndiscoveries. In 1859 the German physicist Julius Plucker (1801-1868)\r\nnoticed that when there was an electrical discharge through an exhausted\r\ntube at a low pressure, on the surrounding walls of the tube near the\r\nnegative pole, or cathode, appeared a greenish phosphorescence. This\r\ndiscovery was soon being investigated by a number of other scientists,\r\namong others Hittorf, Goldstein, and Professor (now Sir William)\r\nCrookes. The explanations given of this phenomenon by Professor Crookes\r\nconcern us here more particularly, inasmuch as his views did not\r\naccord exactly with those held by the other two scientists, and as his\r\nresearches were more directly concerned in the discovery of the\r\nRoentgen rays. He held that the heat and phosphorescence produced in a\r\nlow-pressure tube were caused by streams of particles, projected from\r\nthe cathode with great velocity, striking the sides of the glass tube.\r\nThe composition of the glass seemed to enter into this phosphorescence\r\nalso, for while lead glass produced blue phosphorescence, soda glass\r\nproduced a yellowish green. The composition of the glass seemed to\r\nbe changed by a long-continued pelting of these particles, the\r\nphosphorescence after a time losing its initial brilliancy, caused by\r\nthe glass becoming \"tired,\" as Professor Crookes said. Thus when some\r\nopaque substance, such as iron, is placed between the cathode and the\r\nsides of the glass tube so that it casts a shadow in a certain spot\r\non the glass for some little time, it is found on removing the opaque\r\nsubstance or changing its position that the area of glass at first\r\ncovered by the shadow now responded to the rays in a different manner\r\nfrom the surrounding glass.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar ray's, now known as the cathode rays, not only cast a\r\nshadow, but are deflected by a magnet, so that the position of the\r\nphosphorescence on the sides of the tube may be altered by the proximity\r\nof a powerful magnet. From this it would seem that the rays are composed\r\nof particles charged with negative electricity, and Professor J. J.\r\nThomson has modified the experiment of Perrin to show that negative\r\nelectricity is actually associated with the rays. There is reason for\r\nbelieving, therefore, that the cathode rays are rapidly moving charges\r\nof negative electricity. It is possible, also, to determine the velocity\r\nat which these particles are moving by measuring the deflection produced\r\nby the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nFrom the fact that opaque substances cast a shadow in these rays it was\r\nthought at first that all solids were absolutely opaque to them. Hertz,\r\nhowever, discovered that a small amount of phosphorescence occurred on\r\nthe glass even when such opaque substances as gold-leaf or aluminium\r\nfoil were interposed between the cathode and the sides of the tube.\r\nShortly afterwards Lenard discovered that the cathode rays can be made\r\nto pass from the inside of a discharge tube to the outside air. For\r\nconvenience these rays outside the tube have since been known as \"Lenard\r\nrays.\"\r\n\r\nIn the closing days of December, 1895, Professor Wilhelm Konrad\r\nRoentgen, of Wurzburg, announced that he had made the discovery of the\r\nremarkable effect arising from the cathode rays to which reference\r\nwas made above. He found that if a plate covered with a phosphorescent\r\nsubstance is placed near a discharge tube exhausted so highly that the\r\ncathode rays produced a green phosphorescence, this plate is made to\r\nglow in a peculiar manner. The rays producing this glow were not the\r\ncathode rays, although apparently arising from them, and are what have\r\nsince been called the Roentgen rays, or X-rays.\r\n\r\nRoentgen found that a shadow is thrown upon the screen by substances\r\nheld between it and the exhausted tube, the character of the shadow\r\ndepending upon the density of the substance. Thus metals are almost\r\ncompletely opaque to the rays; such substances as bone much less so, and\r\nordinary flesh hardly so at all. If a coin were held in the hand that\r\nhad been interposed between the tube and the screen the picture formed\r\nshowed the coin as a black shadow; and the bones of the hand, while\r\ncasting a distinct shadow, showed distinctly lighter; while the soft\r\ntissues produced scarcely any shadow at all. The value of such a\r\ndiscovery was obvious from the first; and was still further enhanced by\r\nthe discovery made shortly that, photographic plates are affected by the\r\nrays, thus making it possible to make permanent photographic records of\r\npictures through what we know as opaque substances.\r\n\r\nWhat adds materially to the practical value of Roentgen's discovery is\r\nthe fact that the apparatus for producing the X-rays is now so simple\r\nand relatively inexpensive that it is within the reach even of amateur\r\nscientists. It consists essentially of an induction coil attached either\r\nto cells or a street-current plug for generating the electricity, a\r\nfocus tube, and a phosphorescence screen. These focus tubes are made in\r\nvarious shapes, but perhaps the most popular are in the form of a glass\r\nglobe, not unlike an ordinary small-sized water-bottle, this tube being\r\nclosed and exhausted, and having the two poles (anode and cathode)\r\nsealed into the glass walls, but protruding at either end for attachment\r\nto the conducting wires from the induction coil. This tube may be\r\nmounted on a stand at a height convenient for manipulation.\r\nThe phosphorescence screen is usually a plate covered with some\r\nplatino-cyanide and mounted in the end of a box of convenient size, the\r\nopposite end of which is so shaped that it fits the contour of the face,\r\nshutting out the light and allowing the eyes of the observer to focalize\r\non the screen at the end. For making observations the operator has\r\nsimply to turn on the current of electricity and apply the screen to\r\nhis eyes, pointing it towards the glowing tube, when the shadow of any\r\nsubstance interposed between the tube and the screen will appear upon\r\nthe phosphorescence plate.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful shadow pictures produced on the phosphorescence screen,\r\nor the photographic plate, would seem to come from some peculiar form\r\nof light, but the exact nature of these rays is still an open question.\r\nWhether the Roentgen rays are really a form of light--that is, a form\r\nof \"electro-magnetic disturbance propagated through ether,\" is not fully\r\ndetermined. Numerous experiments have been undertaken to determine this,\r\nbut as yet no proof has been found that the rays are a form of light,\r\nalthough there appears to be nothing in their properties inconsistent\r\nwith their being so. For the moment most investigators are content to\r\nadmit that the term X-ray virtually begs the question as to the intimate\r\nnature of the form of energy involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, it was in 1831 that Faraday opened up the field of\r\nmagneto-electricity. Reversing the experiments of his predecessors, who\r\nhad found that electric currents may generate magnetism, he showed that\r\nmagnets have power under certain circumstances to generate electricity;\r\nhe proved, indeed, the interconvertibility of electricity and magnetism.\r\nThen he showed that all bodies are more or less subject to the influence\r\nof magnetism, and that even light may be affected by magnetism as to its\r\nphenomena of polarization. He satisfied himself completely of the\r\ntrue identity of all the various forms of electricity, and of the\r\nconvertibility of electricity and chemical action. Thus he linked\r\ntogether light, chemical affinity, magnetism, and electricity. And,\r\nmoreover, he knew full well that no one of these can be produced in\r\nindefinite supply from another. \"Nowhere,\" he says, \"is there a pure\r\ncreation or production of power without a corresponding exhaustion of\r\nsomething to supply it.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Faraday wrote those words in 1840 he was treading on the very heels\r\nof a greater generalization than any which he actually formulated; nay,\r\nhe had it fairly within his reach. He saw a great truth without fully\r\nrealizing its import; it was left for others, approaching the same truth\r\nalong another path, to point out its full significance.\r\n\r\nThe great generalization which Faraday so narrowly missed is the truth\r\nwhich since then has become familiar as the doctrine of the conservation\r\nof energy--the law that in transforming energy from one condition to\r\nanother we can never secure more than an equivalent quantity; that, in\r\nshort, \"to create or annihilate energy is as impossible as to create or\r\nannihilate matter; and that all the phenomena of the material universe\r\nconsist in transformations of energy alone.\" Some philosophers think\r\nthis the greatest generalization ever conceived by the mind of man. Be\r\nthat as it may, it is surely one of the great intellectual landmarks\r\nof the nineteenth century. It stands apart, so stupendous and so\r\nfar-reaching in its implications that the generation which first saw the\r\nlaw developed could little appreciate it; only now, through the vista of\r\nhalf a century, do we begin to see it in its true proportions.\r\n\r\nA vast generalization such as this is never a mushroom growth, nor does\r\nit usually spring full grown from the mind of any single man. Always a\r\nnumber of minds are very near a truth before any one mind fully grasps\r\nit. Pre-eminently true is this of the doctrine of the conservation of\r\nenergy. Not Faraday alone, but half a dozen different men had an inkling\r\nof it before it gained full expression; indeed, every man who advocated\r\nthe undulatory theory of light and heat was verging towards the goal.\r\nThe doctrine of Young and Fresnel was as a highway leading surely on\r\nto the wide plain of conservation. The phenomena of electro-magnetism\r\nfurnished another such highway. But there was yet another road which led\r\njust as surely and even more readily to the same goal. This was the road\r\nfurnished by the phenomena of heat, and the men who travelled it were\r\ndestined to outstrip their fellow-workers; though, as we have seen,\r\nwayfarers on other roads were within hailing distance when the leaders\r\npassed the mark.\r\n\r\nIn order to do even approximate justice to the men who entered into\r\nthe great achievement, we must recall that just at the close of the\r\neighteenth century Count Rumford and Humphry Davy independently showed\r\nthat labor may be transformed into heat; and correctly interpreted this\r\nfact as meaning the transformation of molar into molecular motion. We\r\ncan hardly doubt that each of these men of genius realized--vaguely, at\r\nany rate--that there must be a close correspondence between the amount\r\nof the molar and the molecular motions; hence that each of them was in\r\nsight of the law of the mechanical equivalent of heat. But neither of\r\nthem quite grasped or explicitly stated what each must vaguely have\r\nseen; and for just a quarter of a century no one else even came abreast\r\ntheir line of thought, let alone passing it.\r\n\r\nBut then, in 1824, a French philosopher, Sadi Carnot, caught step with\r\nthe great Englishmen, and took a long leap ahead by explicitly stating\r\nhis belief that a definite quantity of work could be transformed into\r\na definite quantity of heat, no more, no less. Carnot did not, indeed,\r\nreach the clear view of his predecessors as to the nature of heat, for\r\nhe still thought it a form of \"imponderable\" fluid; but he reasoned none\r\nthe less clearly as to its mutual convertibility with mechanical work.\r\nBut important as his conclusions seem now that we look back upon\r\nthem with clearer vision, they made no impression whatever upon his\r\ncontemporaries. Carnot's work in this line was an isolated phenomenon\r\nof historical interest, but it did not enter into the scheme of the\r\ncompleted narrative in any such way as did the work of Rumford and Davy.\r\n\r\nThe man who really took up the broken thread where Rumford and Davy had\r\ndropped it, and wove it into a completed texture, came upon the scene\r\nin 1840. His home was in Manchester, England; his occupation that of\r\na manufacturer. He was a friend and pupil of the great Dr. Dalton.\r\nHis name was James Prescott Joule. When posterity has done its final\r\njuggling with the names of the nineteenth century, it is not unlikely\r\nthat the name of this Manchester philosopher will be a household word,\r\nlike the names of Aristotle, Copernicus, and Newton.\r\n\r\nFor Joule's work it was, done in the fifth decade of the century, which\r\ndemonstrated beyond all cavil that there is a precise and absolute\r\nequivalence between mechanical work and heat; that whatever the form of\r\nmanifestation of molar motion, it can generate a definite and measurable\r\namount of heat, and no more. Joule found, for example, that at the\r\nsea-level in Manchester a pound weight falling through seven hundred and\r\nseventy-two feet could generate enough heat to raise the temperature\r\nof a pound of water one degree Fahrenheit. There was nothing haphazard,\r\nnothing accidental, about this; it bore the stamp of unalterable law.\r\nAnd Joule himself saw, what others in time were made to see, that this\r\ntruth is merely a particular case within a more general law. If\r\nheat cannot be in any sense created, but only made manifest as a\r\ntransformation of another kind of motion, then must not the same\r\nthing be true of all those other forms of \"force\"--light, electricity,\r\nmagnetism--which had been shown to be so closely associated, so mutually\r\nconvertible, with heat? All analogy seemed to urge the truth of\r\nthis inference; all experiment tended to confirm it. The law of the\r\nmechanical equivalent of heat then became the main corner-stone of the\r\ngreater law of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nBut while this citation is fresh in mind, we must turn our attention\r\nwith all haste to a country across the Channel--to Denmark, in\r\nshort--and learn that even as Joule experimented with the transformation\r\nof heat, a philosopher of Copenhagen, Colding by name, had hit upon the\r\nsame idea, and carried it far towards a demonstration. And then, without\r\npausing, we must shift yet again, this time to Germany, and consider the\r\nwork of three other men, who independently were on the track of the same\r\ntruth, and two of whom, it must be admitted, reached it earlier than\r\neither Joule or Colding, if neither brought it to quite so clear a\r\ndemonstration. The names of these three Germans are Mohr, Mayer,\r\nand Helmholtz. Their share in establishing the great doctrine of\r\nconservation must now claim our attention.\r\n\r\nAs to Karl Friedrich Mohr, it may be said that his statement of the\r\ndoctrine preceded that of any of his fellows, yet that otherwise it was\r\nperhaps least important. In 1837 this thoughtful German had grasped\r\nthe main truth, and given it expression in an article published in the\r\nZeitschrift fur Physik, etc. But the article attracted no attention\r\nwhatever, even from Mohr's own countrymen. Still, Mohr's title to\r\nrank as one who independently conceived the great truth, and perhaps\r\nconceived it before any other man in the world saw it as clearly, even\r\nthough he did not demonstrate its validity, is not to be disputed.\r\n\r\nIt was just five years later, in 1842, that Dr. Julius Robert Mayer,\r\npractising physician in the little German town of Heilbronn, published a\r\npaper in Liebig's Annalen on \"The Forces of Inorganic Nature,\" in which\r\nnot merely the mechanical theory of heat, but the entire doctrine of\r\nthe conservation of energy, is explicitly if briefly stated. Two years\r\nearlier Dr. Mayer, while surgeon to a Dutch India vessel cruising in the\r\ntropics, had observed that the venous blood of a patient seemed redder\r\nthan venous blood usually is observed to be in temperate climates. He\r\npondered over this seemingly insignificant fact, and at last reached\r\nthe conclusion that the cause must be the lesser amount of oxidation\r\nrequired to keep up the body temperature in the tropics. Led by this\r\nreflection to consider the body as a machine dependent on outside forces\r\nfor its capacity to act, he passed on into a novel realm of thought,\r\nwhich brought him at last to independent discovery of the mechanical\r\ntheory of heat, and to the first full and comprehensive appreciation\r\nof the great law of conservation. Blood-letting, the modern physician\r\nholds, was a practice of very doubtful benefit, as a rule, to the\r\nsubject; but once, at least, it led to marvellous results. No straw is\r\ngo small that it may not point the receptive mind of genius to new and\r\nwonderful truths.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYER'S PAPER OF 1842\r\n\r\nThe paper in which Mayer first gave expression to his revolutionary\r\nideas bore the title of \"The Forces of Inorganic Nature,\" and was\r\npublished in 1842. It is one of the gems of scientific literature, and\r\nfortunately it is not too long to be quoted in its entirety. Seldom if\r\never was a great revolutionary doctrine expounded in briefer compass:\r\n\r\n\"What are we to understand by 'forces'? and how are different forces\r\nrelated to each other? The term force conveys for the most part the idea\r\nof something unknown, unsearchable, and hypothetical; while the term\r\nmatter, on the other hand, implies the possession, by the object in\r\nquestion, of such definite properties as weight and extension. An\r\nattempt, therefore, to render the idea of force equally exact with that\r\nof matter is one which should be welcomed by all those who desire to\r\nhave their views of nature clear and unencumbered by hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\"Forces are causes; and accordingly we may make full application in\r\nrelation to them of the principle causa aequat effectum. If the cause\r\nc has the effect e, then c = e; if, in its turn, e is the cause of a\r\nsecond effect of f, we have e = f, and so on: c = e = f... = c. In a\r\nseries of causes and effects, a term or a part of a term can never, as\r\nis apparent from the nature of an equation, become equal to nothing.\r\nThis first property of all causes we call their indestructibility.\r\n\r\n\"If the given cause c has produced an effect e equal to itself, it has\r\nin that very act ceased to be--c has become e. If, after the production\r\nof e, c still remained in the whole or in part, there must be still\r\nfurther effects corresponding to this remaining cause: the total effect\r\nof c would thus be > e, which would be contrary to the supposition c =\r\ne. Accordingly, since c becomes e, and e becomes f, etc., we must regard\r\nthese various magnitudes as different forms under which one and the same\r\nobject makes its appearance. This capability of assuming various forms\r\nis the second essential property of all causes. Taking both properties\r\ntogether, we may say, causes an INDESTRUCTIBLE quantitatively, and\r\nquantitatively CONVERTIBLE objects.\r\n\r\n\"There occur in nature two causes which apparently never pass one into\r\nthe other,\" said Mayer. \"The first class consists of such causes as\r\npossess the properties of weight and impenetrability. These are kinds of\r\nmatter. The other class is composed of causes which are wanting in the\r\nproperties just mentioned--namely, forces, called also imponderables,\r\nfrom the negative property that has been indicated. Forces are therefore\r\nINDESTRUCTIBLE, CONVERTIBLE, IMPONDERABLE OBJECTS.\r\n\r\n\"As an example of causes and effects, take matter: explosive gas, H + O,\r\nand water, HO, are related to each other as cause and effect; therefore\r\nH + O = HO. But if H + O becomes HO, heat, cal., makes its appearance\r\nas well as water; this heat must likewise have a cause, x, and we have\r\ntherefore H + O + X = HO + cal. It might be asked, however, whether H\r\n+ O is really = HO, and x = cal., and not perhaps H + O = cal., and x =\r\nHO, whence the above equation could equally be deduced; and so in many\r\nother cases. The phlogistic chemists recognized the equation between\r\ncal. and x, or phlogiston as they called it, and in so doing made a\r\ngreat step in advance; but they involved themselves again in a system of\r\nmistakes by putting x in place of O. In this way they obtained H = HO +\r\nx.\r\n\r\n\"Chemistry teaches us that matter, as a cause, has matter for its\r\neffect; but we may say with equal justification that to force as a cause\r\ncorresponds force as effect. Since c = e, and e = c, it is natural to\r\ncall one term of an equation a force, and the other an effect of force,\r\nor phenomenon, and to attach different notions to the expression force\r\nand phenomenon. In brief, then, if the cause is matter, the effect is\r\nmatter; if the cause is a force, the effect is also a force.\r\n\r\n\"The cause that brings about the raising of a weight is a force. The\r\neffect of the raised weight is, therefore, also a force; or, expressed\r\nin a more general form, SEPARATION IN SPACE OF PONDERABLE OBJECTS IS\r\nA FORCE; and since this force causes the fall of bodies, we call it\r\nFALLING FORCE. Falling force and fall, or, still more generally,\r\nfalling force and motion, are forces related to each other as cause and\r\neffect--forces convertible into each other--two different forms of one\r\nand the same object. For example, a weight resting on the ground is not\r\na force: it is neither the cause of motion nor of the lifting of another\r\nweight. It becomes so, however, in proportion as it is raised above the\r\nground. The cause--that is, the distance between a weight and the earth,\r\nand the effect, or the quantity of motion produced, bear to each other,\r\nas shown by mechanics, a constant relation.\r\n\r\n\"Gravity being regarded as the cause of the falling of bodies, a\r\ngravitating force is spoken of; and thus the ideas of PROPERTY and\r\nof FORCE are confounded with each other. Precisely that which is\r\nthe essential attribute of every force--that is, the UNION of\r\nindestructibility with convertibility--is wanting in every property:\r\nbetween a property and a force, between gravity and motion, it is\r\ntherefore impossible to establish the equation required for a rightly\r\nconceived causal relation. If gravity be called a force, a cause\r\nis supposed which produces effects without itself diminishing, and\r\nincorrect conceptions of the causal connections of things are thereby\r\nfostered. In order that a body may fall, it is just as necessary that it\r\nbe lifted up as that it should be heavy or possess gravity. The fall of\r\nbodies, therefore, ought not to be ascribed to their gravity alone. The\r\nproblem of mechanics is to develop the equations which subsist between\r\nfalling force and motion, motion and falling force, and between\r\ndifferent motions. Here is a case in point: The magnitude of the falling\r\nforce v is directly proportional (the earth's radius being assumed--oo)\r\nto the magnitude of the mass m, and the height d, to which it is\r\nraised--that is, v = md. If the height d = l, to which the mass m is\r\nraised, is transformed into the final velocity c = l of this mass, we\r\nhave also v = mc; but from the known relations existing between d and c,\r\nit results that, for other values of d or of c, the measure of the\r\nforce v is mc squared; accordingly v = md = mcsquared. The law of the\r\nconservation of vis viva is thus found to be based on the general law of\r\nthe indestructibility of causes.\r\n\r\n\"In many cases we see motion cease without having caused another motion\r\nor the lifting of a weight. But a force once in existence cannot be\r\nannihilated--it can only change its form. And the question therefore\r\narises, what other forms is force, which we have become acquainted with\r\nas falling force and motion, capable of assuming? Experience alone\r\ncan lead us to a conclusion on this point. That we may experiment to\r\nadvantage, we must select implements which, besides causing a real\r\ncessation of motion, are as little as possible altered by the objects\r\nto be examined. For example, if we rub together two metal plates, we see\r\nmotion disappear, and heat, on the other hand, make its appearance, and\r\nthere remains to be determined only whether MOTION is the cause of heat.\r\nIn order to reach a decision on this point, we must discuss the question\r\nwhether, in the numberless cases in which the expenditure of motion is\r\naccompanied by the appearance of heat, the motion has not some other\r\neffect than the production of heat, and the heat some other cause than\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\n\"A serious attempt to ascertain the effects of ceasing motion has never\r\nbeen made. Without wishing to exclude a priori the hypothesis which\r\nit may be possible to establish, therefore, we observe only that, as a\r\nrule, this effect cannot be supposed to be an alteration in the state of\r\naggregation of the moved (that is, rubbing, etc.) bodies. If we assume\r\nthat a certain quantity of motion v is expended in the conversion of a\r\nrubbing substance m into n, we must then have m + v - n, and n = m + v;\r\nand when n is reconverted into m, v must appear again in some form or\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"By the friction of two metallic plates continued for a very long time,\r\nwe can gradually cause the cessation of an immense quantity of movement;\r\nbut would it ever occur to us to look for even the smallest trace of the\r\nforce which has disappeared in the metallic dust that we could collect,\r\nand to try to regain it thence? We repeat, the motion cannot have been\r\nannihilated; and contrary, or positive and negative, motions cannot be\r\nregarded as = o any more than contrary motions can come out of nothing,\r\nor a weight can raise itself.\r\n\r\n\"Without the recognition of a causal relation between motion and heat,\r\nit is just as difficult to explain the production of heat as it is\r\nto give any account of the motion that disappears. The heat cannot be\r\nderived from the diminution of the volume of the rubbing substances.\r\nIt is well known that two pieces of ice may be melted by rubbing them\r\ntogether in vacuo; but let any one try to convert ice into water by\r\npressure, however enormous. The author has found that water undergoes\r\na rise of temperature when shaken violently. The water so heated (from\r\ntwelve to thirteen degrees centigrade) has a greater bulk after being\r\nshaken than it had before. Whence now comes this quantity of heat, which\r\nby repeated shaking may be called into existence in the same apparatus\r\nas often as we please? The vibratory hypothesis of heat is an approach\r\ntowards the doctrine of heat being the effect of motion, but it does not\r\nfavor the admission of this causal relation in its full generality. It\r\nrather lays the chief stress on restless oscillations.\r\n\r\n\"If it be considered as now established that in many cases no other\r\neffect of motion can be traced except heat, and that no other cause\r\nthan motion can be found for the heat that is produced, we prefer the\r\nassumption that heat proceeds from motion to the assumption of a cause\r\nwithout effect and of an effect without a cause. Just as the chemist,\r\ninstead of allowing oxygen and hydrogen to disappear without further\r\ninvestigation, and water to be produced in some inexplicable manner,\r\nestablishes a connection between oxygen and hydrogen on the one hand,\r\nand water on the other.\r\n\r\n\"We may conceive the natural connection existing between falling force,\r\nmotion, and heat as follows: We know that heat makes its appearance\r\nwhen the separate particles of a body approach nearer to each other;\r\ncondensation produces heat. And what applies to the smallest particles\r\nof matter, and the smallest intervals between them, must also apply to\r\nlarge masses and to measurable distances. The falling of a weight is a\r\ndiminution of the bulk of the earth, and must therefore without doubt be\r\nrelated to the quantity of heat thereby developed; this quantity of heat\r\nmust be proportional to the greatness of the weight and its distance\r\nfrom the ground. From this point of view we are easily led to the\r\nequations between falling force, motion, and heat that have already been\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\n\"But just as little as the connection between falling force and motion\r\nauthorizes the conclusion that the essence of falling force is motion,\r\ncan such a conclusion be adopted in the case of heat. We are, on the\r\ncontrary, rather inclined to infer that, before it can become heat,\r\nmotion must cease to exist as motion, whether simple, or vibratory, as\r\nin the case of light and radiant heat, etc.\r\n\r\n\"If falling force and motion are equivalent to heat, heat must also\r\nnaturally be equivalent to motion and falling force. Just as heat\r\nappears as an EFFECT of the diminution of bulk and of the cessation\r\nof motion, so also does heat disappear as a CAUSE when its effects are\r\nproduced in the shape of motion, expansion, or raising of weight.\r\n\r\n\"In water-mills the continual diminution in bulk which the earth\r\nundergoes, owing to the fall of the water, gives rise to motion, which\r\nafterwards disappears again, calling forth unceasingly a great quantity\r\nof heat; and, inversely, the steam-engine serves to decompose heat again\r\ninto motion or the raising of weights. A locomotive with its train may\r\nbe compared to a distilling apparatus; the heat applied under the boiler\r\npasses off as motion, and this is deposited again as heat at the axles\r\nof the wheels.\"\r\n\r\nMayer then closes his paper with the following deduction: \"The solution\r\nof the equations subsisting between falling force and motion requires\r\nthat the space fallen through in a given time--e. g., the first\r\nsecond--should be experimentally determined. In like manner, the\r\nsolution of the equations subsisting between falling force and motion on\r\nthe one hand and heat on the other requires an answer to the question,\r\nHow great is the quantity of heat which corresponds to a given quantity\r\nof motion or falling force? For instance, we must ascertain how high a\r\ngiven weight requires to be raised above the ground in order that its\r\nfalling force maybe equivalent to the raising of the temperature of\r\nan equal weight of water from 0 degrees to 1 degrees centigrade. The\r\nattempt to show that such an equation is the expression of a physical\r\ntruth may be regarded as the substance of the foregoing remarks.\r\n\r\n\"By applying the principles that have been set forth to the relations\r\nsubsisting between the temperature and the volume of gases, we find\r\nthat the sinking of a mercury column by which a gas is compressed is\r\nequivalent to the quantity of heat set free by the compression; and\r\nhence it follows, the ratio between the capacity for heat of air under\r\nconstant pressure and its capacity under constant volume being taken as\r\n= 1.421, that the warming of a given weight of water from 0 degrees to\r\n equal weight from the height of about three hundred and sixty-five\r\nmetres. If we compare with this result the working of our best\r\nsteam-engines, we see how small a part only of the heat applied under\r\nthe boiler is really transformed into motion or the raising of weights;\r\nand this may serve as justification for the attempts at the profitable\r\nproduction of motion by some other method than the expenditure of the\r\nchemical difference between carbon and oxygen--more particularly by\r\nthe transformation into motion of electricity obtained by chemical\r\nmeans.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAYER AND HELMHOLTZ\r\n\r\nHere, then, was this obscure German physician, leading the humdrum life\r\nof a village practitioner, yet seeing such visions as no human being in\r\nthe world had ever seen before.\r\n\r\nThe great principle he had discovered became the dominating thought of\r\nhis life, and filled all his leisure hours. He applied it far and wide,\r\namid all the phenomena of the inorganic and organic worlds. It taught\r\nhim that both vegetables and animals are machines, bound by the same\r\nlaws that hold sway over inorganic matter, transforming energy, but\r\ncreating nothing. Then his mind reached out into space and met a\r\nuniverse made up of questions. Each star that blinked down at him as he\r\nrode in answer to a night-call seemed an interrogation-point asking,\r\nHow do I exist? Why have I not long since burned out if your theory\r\nof conservation be true? No one had hitherto even tried to answer that\r\nquestion; few had so much as realized that it demanded an answer. But\r\nthe Heilbronn physician understood the question and found an answer.\r\nHis meteoric hypothesis, published in 1848, gave for the first time a\r\ntenable explanation of the persistent light and heat of our sun and the\r\nmyriad other suns--an explanation to which we shall recur in another\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nAll this time our isolated philosopher, his brain aflame with the glow\r\nof creative thought, was quite unaware that any one else in the world\r\nwas working along the same lines. And the outside world was equally\r\nheedless of the work of the Heilbronn physician. There was no friend to\r\ninspire enthusiasm and give courage, no kindred spirit to react on this\r\nmasterful but lonely mind. And this is the more remarkable because there\r\nare few other cases where a master-originator in science has come upon\r\nthe scene except as the pupil or friend of some other master-originator.\r\nOf the men we have noticed in the present connection, Young was the\r\nfriend and confrere of Davy; Davy, the protege of Rumford; Faraday, the\r\npupil of Davy; Fresnel, the co-worker with Arago; Colding, the confrere\r\nof Oersted; Joule, the pupil of Dalton. But Mayer is an isolated\r\nphenomenon--one of the lone mountain-peak intellects of the century.\r\nThat estimate may be exaggerated which has called him the Galileo of the\r\nnineteenth century, but surely no lukewarm praise can do him justice.\r\n\r\nYet for a long time his work attracted no attention whatever. In 1847,\r\nwhen another German physician, Hermann von Helmholtz, one of the most\r\nmassive and towering intellects of any age, had been independently\r\nled to comprehension of the doctrine of the conservation of energy\r\nand published his treatise on the subject, he had hardly heard of his\r\ncountryman Mayer. When he did hear of him, however, he hastened to\r\nrenounce all claim to the doctrine of conservation, though the world at\r\nlarge gives him credit of independent even though subsequent discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOULE'S PAPER OF 1843\r\n\r\nMeantime, in England, Joule was going on from one experimental\r\ndemonstration to another, oblivious of his German competitors and almost\r\nas little noticed by his own countrymen. He read his first paper before\r\nthe chemical section of the British Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience in 1843, and no one heeded it in the least. It is well worth our\r\nwhile, however, to consider it at length. It bears the title, \"On the\r\nCalorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity, and the Mechanical Value\r\nof Heat.\" The full text, as published in the Report of the British\r\nAssociation, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Although it has been long known that fine platinum wire can be ignited\r\nby magneto-electricity, it still remained a matter of doubt whether heat\r\nwas evolved by the COILS in which the magneto-electricity was generated;\r\nand it seemed indeed not unreasonable to suppose that COLD was produced\r\nthere in order to make up for the heat evolved by the other part of\r\nthe circuit. The author therefore has endeavored to clear up this\r\nuncertainty by experiment. His apparatus consisted of a small compound\r\nelectro-magnet, immersed in water, revolving between the poles of a\r\npowerful stationary magnet. The magneto-electricity developed in the\r\ncoils of the revolving electro-magnet was measured by an accurate\r\ngalvanometer; and the temperature of the water was taken before and\r\nafter each experiment by a very delicate thermometer. The influence of\r\nthe temperature of the surrounding atmospheric air was guarded against\r\nby covering the revolving tube with flannel, etc., and by the adoption\r\nof a system of interpolation. By an extensive series of experiments with\r\nthe above apparatus the author succeeded in proving that heat is evolved\r\nby the coils of the magneto-electrical machine, as well as by any other\r\npart of the circuit, in proportion to the resistance to conduction\r\nof the wire and the square of the current; the magneto having, under\r\ncomparable circumstances, the same calorific power as the voltaic\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Jacobi, of St. Petersburg, bad shown that the motion of an\r\nelectro-magnetic machine generates magneto-electricity in opposition\r\nto the voltaic current of the battery. The author had observed the same\r\nphenomenon on arranging his apparatus as an electro-magnetic machine;\r\nbut had found that no additional heat was evolved on account of the\r\nconflict of forces in the coil of the electro-magnet, and that the heat\r\nevolved by the coil remained, as before, proportional to the square of\r\nthe current. Again, by turning the machine contrary to the direction of\r\nthe attractive forces, so as to increase the intensity of the voltaic\r\ncurrent by the assistance of the magneto-electricity, he found that the\r\nevolution of heat was still proportional to the square of the current.\r\nThe author discovered, therefore, that the heat evolved by the voltaic\r\ncurrent is invariably proportional to the square of the current, however\r\nthe intensity of the current may be varied by magnetic induction. But\r\nDr. Faraday has shown that the chemical effects of the current\r\nare simply as its quantity. Therefore he concluded that in the\r\nelectro-magnetic engine a part of the heat due to the chemical actions\r\nof the battery is lost by the circuit, and converted into mechanical\r\npower; and that when the electro-magnetic engine is turned CONTRARY to\r\nthe direction of the attractive forces, a greater quantity of heat is\r\nevolved by the circuit than is due to the chemical reactions of the\r\nbattery, the over-plus quantity being produced by the conversion of the\r\nmechanical force exerted in turning the machine. By a dynamometrical\r\napparatus attached to his machine, the author has ascertained that,\r\nin all the above cases, a quantity of heat, capable of increasing the\r\ntemperature of a pound of water by one degree of Fahrenheit's scale, is\r\nequal to the mechanical force capable of raising a weight of about eight\r\nhundred and thirty pounds to the height of one foot.\"(2)\r\n\r\n\r\nJOULE OR MAYER?\r\n\r\nTwo years later Joule wished to read another paper, but the chairman\r\nhinted that time was limited, and asked him to confine himself to\r\na brief verbal synopsis of the results of his experiments. Had the\r\nchairman but known it, he was curtailing a paper vastly more important\r\nthan all the other papers of the meeting put together. However, the\r\nsynopsis was given, and one man was there to hear it who had the genius\r\nto appreciate its importance. This was William Thomson, the present\r\nLord Kelvin, now known to all the world as among the greatest of natural\r\nphilosophers, but then only a novitiate in science. He came to\r\nJoule's aid, started rolling the ball of controversy, and subsequently\r\nassociated himself with the Manchester experimenter in pursuing his\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nBut meantime the acknowledged leaders of British science viewed the\r\nnew doctrine askance. Faraday, Brewster, Herschel--those were the great\r\nnames in physics at that day, and no one of them could quite accept\r\nthe new views regarding energy. For several years no older physicist,\r\nspeaking with recognized authority, came forward in support of the\r\ndoctrine of conservation. This culminating thought of the first half\r\nof the nineteenth century came silently into the world, unheralded and\r\nunopposed. The fifth decade of the century had seen it elaborated and\r\nsubstantially demonstrated in at least three different countries, yet\r\neven the leaders of thought did not so much as know of its existence.\r\nIn 1853 Whewell, the historian of the inductive sciences, published a\r\nsecond edition of his history, and, as Huxley has pointed out, he did\r\nnot so much as refer to the revolutionizing thought which even then was\r\na full decade old.\r\n\r\nBy this time, however, the battle was brewing. The rising generation\r\nsaw the importance of a law which their elders could not appreciate, and\r\nsoon it was noised abroad that there were more than one claimant to the\r\nhonor of discovery. Chiefly through the efforts of Professor Tyndall,\r\nthe work of Mayer became known to the British public, and a most\r\nregrettable controversy ensued between the partisans of Mayer and those\r\nof Joule--a bitter controversy, in which Davy's contention that science\r\nknows no country was not always regarded, and which left its scars upon\r\nthe hearts and minds of the great men whose personal interests were\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nAnd so to this day the question who is the chief discoverer of the law\r\nof the conservation of energy is not susceptible of a categorical answer\r\nthat would satisfy all philosophers. It is generally held that the first\r\nchoice lies between Joule and Mayer. Professor Tyndall has expressed the\r\nbelief that in future each of these men will be equally remembered in\r\nconnection with this work. But history gives us no warrant for such a\r\nhope. Posterity in the long run demands always that its heroes shall\r\nstand alone. Who remembers now that Robert Hooke contested with Newton\r\nthe discovery of the doctrine of universal gravitation? The judgment of\r\nposterity is unjust, but it is inexorable. And so we can little doubt\r\nthat a century from now one name will be mentioned as that of the\r\noriginator of the great doctrine of the conservation of energy. The man\r\nwhose name is thus remembered will perhaps be spoken of as the Galileo,\r\nthe Newton, of the nineteenth century; but whether the name thus\r\ndignified by the final verdict of history will be that of Colding, Mohr,\r\nMayer, Helmholtz, or Joule, is not as, yet decided.\r\n\r\n\r\nLORD KELVIN AND THE DISSIPATION OF ENERGY\r\n\r\nThe gradual permeation of the field by the great doctrine of\r\nconservation simply repeated the history of the introduction of every\r\nnovel and revolutionary thought. Necessarily the elder generation, to\r\nwhom all forms of energy were imponderable fluids, must pass away before\r\nthe new conception could claim the field. Even the word energy, though\r\nYoung had introduced it in 1807, did not come into general use till some\r\ntime after the middle of the century. To the generality of philosophers\r\n(the word physicist was even less in favor at this time) the various\r\nforms of energy were still subtile fluids, and never was idea\r\nrelinquished with greater unwillingness than this. The experiments of\r\nYoung and Fresnel had convinced a large number of philosophers that\r\nlight is a vibration and not a substance; but so great an authority as\r\nBiot clung to the old emission idea to the end of his life, in 1862, and\r\nheld a following.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, the company of brilliant young men who had just\r\nserved their apprenticeship when the doctrine of conservation came upon\r\nthe scene had grown into authoritative positions, and were battling\r\nactively for the new ideas. Confirmatory evidence that energy is a\r\nmolecular motion and not an \"imponderable\" form of matter accumulated\r\nday by day. The experiments of two Frenchmen, Hippolyte L. Fizeau and\r\nLeon Foucault, served finally to convince the last lingering sceptics\r\nthat light is an undulation; and by implication brought heat into the\r\nsame category, since James David Forbes, the Scotch physicist, had shown\r\nin 1837 that radiant heat conforms to the same laws of polarization\r\nand double refraction that govern light. But, for that matter, the\r\nexperiments that had established the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat hardly left room for doubt as to the immateriality of this\r\n\"imponderable.\" Doubters had indeed, expressed scepticism as to\r\nthe validity of Joule's experiments, but the further researches,\r\nexperimental and mathematical, of such workers as Thomson (Lord Kelvin),\r\nRankine, and Tyndall in Great Britain, of Helmholtz and Clausius in\r\nGermany, and of Regnault in France, dealing with various manifestations\r\nof heat, placed the evidence beyond the reach of criticism.\r\n\r\nOut of these studies, just at the middle of the century, to which\r\nthe experiments of Mayer and Joule had led, grew the new science\r\nof thermo-dynamics. Out of them also grew in the mind of one of the\r\ninvestigators a new generalization, only second in importance to the\r\ndoctrine of conservation itself. Professor William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)\r\nin his studies in thermodynamics was early impressed with the fact that\r\nwhereas all the molar motion developed through labor or gravity could\r\nbe converted into heat, the process is not fully reversible. Heat can,\r\nindeed, be converted into molar motion or work, but in the process a\r\ncertain amount of the heat is radiated into space and lost. The same\r\nthing happens whenever any other form of energy is converted into molar\r\nmotion. Indeed, every transmutation of energy, of whatever character,\r\nseems complicated by a tendency to develop heat, part of which is\r\nlost. This observation led Professor Thomson to his doctrine of the\r\ndissipation of energy, which he formulated before the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh in 1852, and published also in the Philosophical Magazine the\r\nsame year, the title borne being, \"On a Universal Tendency in Nature to\r\nthe Dissipation of Mechanical Energy.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the principle here expressed Professor Thomson drew the startling\r\nconclusion that, \"since any restoration of this mechanical energy\r\nwithout more than an equivalent dissipation is impossible,\" the\r\nuniverse, as known to us, must be in the condition of a machine\r\ngradually running down; and in particular that the world we live on has\r\nbeen within a finite time unfit for human habitation, and must again\r\nbecome so within a finite future. This thought seems such a commonplace\r\nto-day that it is difficult to realize how startling it appeared half a\r\ncentury ago. A generation trained, as ours has been, in the doctrines\r\nof the conservation and dissipation of energy as the very alphabet\r\nof physical science can but ill appreciate the mental attitude of a\r\ngeneration which for the most part had not even thought it problematical\r\nwhether the sun could continue to give out heat and light forever. But\r\nthose advance thinkers who had grasped the import of the doctrine of\r\nconservation could at once appreciate the force of Thomson's doctrine\r\nof dissipation, and realize the complementary character of the two\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\nHere and there a thinker like Rankine did, indeed, attempt to fancy\r\nconditions under which the energy lost through dissipation might be\r\nrestored to availability, but no such effort has met with success, and\r\nin time Professor Thomson's generalization and his conclusions as to the\r\nconsequences of the law involved came to be universally accepted.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the new views regarding the nature of energy\r\nfollowed, as I have said, the course of every other growth of new ideas.\r\nYoung and imaginative men could accept the new point of view; older\r\nphilosophers, their minds channelled by preconceptions, could not get\r\ninto the new groove. So strikingly true is this in the particular case\r\nnow before us that it is worth while to note the ages at the time of the\r\nrevolutionary experiments of the men whose work has been mentioned as\r\nentering into the scheme of evolution of the idea that energy is merely\r\na manifestation of matter in motion. Such a list will tell the story\r\nbetter than a volume of commentary.\r\n\r\nObserve, then, that Davy made his epochal experiment of melting ice by\r\nfriction when he was a youth of twenty. Young was no older when he\r\nmade his first communication to the Royal Society, and was in his\r\ntwenty-seventh year when he first actively espoused the undulatory\r\ntheory. Fresnel was twenty-six when he made his first important\r\ndiscoveries in the same field; and Arago, who at once became his\r\nchampion, was then but two years his senior, though for a decade he had\r\nbeen so famous that one involuntarily thinks of him as belonging to an\r\nelder generation.\r\n\r\nForbes was under thirty when he discovered the polarization of heat,\r\nwhich pointed the way to Mohr, then thirty-one, to the mechanical\r\nequivalent. Joule was twenty-two in 1840, when his great work was\r\nbegun; and Mayer, whose discoveries date from the same year, was then\r\ntwenty-six, which was also the age of Helmholtz when he published his\r\nindependent discovery of the same law. William Thomson was a youth just\r\npast his majority when he came to the aid of Joule before the British\r\nSociety, and but seven years older when he formulated his own doctrine\r\nof the dissipation of energy. And Clausius and Rankine, who are usually\r\nmentioned with Thomson as the great developers of thermo-dynamics, were\r\nboth far advanced with their novel studies before they were thirty.\r\nWith such a list in mind, we may well agree with the father of inductive\r\nscience that \"the man who is young in years may be old in hours.\"\r\n\r\nYet we must not forget that the shield has a reverse side. For was not\r\nthe greatest of observing astronomers, Herschel, past thirty-five before\r\nhe ever saw a telescope, and past fifty before he discovered the heat\r\nrays of the spectrum? And had not Faraday reached middle life before he\r\nturned his attention especially to electricity? Clearly, then, to make\r\nthis phrase complete, Bacon should have added that \"the man who is\r\nold in years may be young in imagination.\" Here, however, even more\r\nappropriate than in the other case--more's the pity--would have been the\r\napplication of his qualifying clause: \"but that happeneth rarely.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL UNIFICATION\r\n\r\nThere are only a few great generalizations as yet thought out in any\r\nsingle field of science. Naturally, then, after a great generalization\r\nhas found definitive expression, there is a period of lull before\r\nanother forward move. In the case of the doctrines of energy, the\r\nlull has lasted half a century. Throughout this period, it is true, a\r\nmultitude of workers have been delving in the field, and to the casual\r\nobserver it might seem as if their activity had been boundless, while\r\nthe practical applications of their ideas--as exemplified, for example,\r\nin the telephone, phonograph, electric light, and so on--have been\r\nlittle less than revolutionary. Yet the most competent of living\r\nauthorities, Lord Kelvin, could assert in 1895 that in fifty years he\r\nhad learned nothing new regarding the nature of energy.\r\n\r\nThis, however, must not be interpreted as meaning that the world has\r\nstood still during these two generations. It means rather that the rank\r\nand file have been moving forward along the road the leaders had\r\nalready travelled. Only a few men in the world had the range of thought\r\nregarding the new doctrine of energy that Lord Kelvin had at the middle\r\nof the century. The few leaders then saw clearly enough that if one\r\nform of energy is in reality merely an undulation or vibration among the\r\nparticles of \"ponderable\" matter or of ether, all other manifestations\r\nof energy must be of the same nature. But the rank and file were not\r\neven within sight of this truth for a long time after they had partly\r\ngrasped the meaning of the doctrine of conservation. When, late in\r\nthe fifties, that marvellous young Scotchman, James Clerk-Maxwell,\r\nformulating in other words an idea of Faraday's, expressed his belief\r\nthat electricity and magnetism are but manifestations of various\r\nconditions of stress and motion in the ethereal medium (electricity a\r\ndisplacement of strain, magnetism a whirl in the ether), the idea met\r\nwith no immediate popularity. And even less cordial was the reception\r\ngiven the same thinker's theory, put forward in 1863, that the ethereal\r\nundulations producing the phenomenon we call light differ in no respect\r\nexcept in their wave-length from the pulsations of electro-magnetism.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time Helmholtz formulated a somewhat similar\r\nelectro-magnetic theory of light; but even the weight of this combined\r\nauthority could not give the doctrine vogue until very recently, when\r\nthe experiments of Heinrich Hertz, the pupil of Helmholtz, have shown\r\nthat a condition of electrical strain may be developed into a wave\r\nsystem by recurrent interruptions of the electric state in the\r\ngenerator, and that such waves travel through the ether with the\r\nrapidity of light. Since then the electro-magnetic theory of light has\r\nbeen enthusiastically referred to as the greatest generalization of\r\nthe century; but the sober thinker must see that it is really only\r\nwhat Hertz himself called it--one pier beneath the great arch of\r\nconservation. It is an interesting detail of the architecture, but the\r\npart cannot equal the size of the whole.\r\n\r\nMore than that, this particular pier is as yet by no means a very firm\r\none. It has, indeed, been demonstrated that waves of electro-magnetism\r\npass through space with the speed of light, but as yet no one has\r\ndeveloped electric waves even remotely approximating the shortness of\r\nthe visual rays. The most that can positively be asserted, therefore,\r\nis that all the known forms of radiant energy-heat, light,\r\nelectro-magnetism--travel through space at the same rate of speed, and\r\nconsist of traverse vibrations--\"lateral quivers,\" as Fresnel said of\r\nlight--known to differ in length, and not positively known to differ\r\notherwise. It has, indeed, been suggested that the newest form of\r\nradiant energy, the famous X-ray of Professor Roentgen's discovery, is\r\na longitudinal vibration, but this is a mere surmise. Be that as it\r\nmay, there is no one now to question that all forms of radiant energy,\r\nwhatever their exact affinities, consist essentially of undulatory\r\nmotions of one uniform medium.\r\n\r\nA full century of experiment, calculation, and controversy has thus\r\nsufficed to correlate the \"imponderable fluids\" of our forebears, and\r\nreduce them all to manifestations of motion among particles of matter.\r\nAt first glimpse that seems an enormous change of view. And yet, when\r\nclosely considered, that change in thought is not so radical as the\r\nchange in phrase might seem to imply. For the nineteenth-century\r\nphysicist, in displacing the \"imponderable fluids\" of many kinds--one\r\neach for light, heat, electricity, magnetism--has been obliged to\r\nsubstitute for them one all-pervading fluid, whose various quivers,\r\nwaves, ripples, whirls or strains produce the manifestations which in\r\npopular parlance are termed forms of force. This all-pervading fluid the\r\nphysicist terms the ether, and he thinks of it as having no weight. In\r\neffect, then, the physicist has dispossessed the many imponderables in\r\nfavor of a single imponderable--though the word imponderable has been\r\nbanished from his vocabulary. In this view the ether--which, considered\r\nas a recognized scientific verity, is essentially a nineteenth-century\r\ndiscovery--is about the most interesting thing in the universe.\r\nSomething more as to its properties, real or assumed, we shall have\r\noccasion to examine as we turn to the obverse side of physics, which\r\ndemands our attention in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE ETHER AND PONDERABLE MATTER\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Whatever difficulties we may have in forming a consistent idea of the\r\nconstitution of the ether, there can be no doubt that the interplanetary\r\nand interstellar spaces are not empty, but are occupied by a material\r\nsubstance or body which is certainly the largest and probably the most\r\nuniform body of which we have any knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the verdict pronounced some thirty years ago by James\r\nClerk-Maxwell, one of the very greatest of nineteenth-century\r\nphysicists, regarding the existence of an all-pervading plenum in the\r\nuniverse, in which every particle of tangible matter is immersed.\r\nAnd this verdict may be said to express the attitude of the entire\r\nphilosophical world of our day. Without exception, the authoritative\r\nphysicists of our time accept this plenum as a verity, and reason about\r\nit with something of the same confidence they manifest in speaking of\r\n\"ponderable\" matter or of, energy. It is true there are those among them\r\nwho are disposed to deny that this all-pervading plenum merits the name\r\nof matter. But that it is a something, and a vastly important something\r\nat that, all are agreed. Without it, they allege, we should know nothing\r\nof light, of radiant heat, of electricity or magnetism; without it there\r\nwould probably be no such thing as gravitation; nay, they even hint that\r\nwithout this strange something, ether, there would be no such thing as\r\nmatter in the universe. If these contentions of the modern physicist are\r\njustified, then this intangible ether is incomparably the most important\r\nas well as the \"largest and most uniform substance or body\" in the\r\nuniverse. Its discovery may well be looked upon as one of the most\r\nimportant feats of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nFor a discovery of that century it surely is, in the sense that all\r\nthe known evidences of its existence were gathered in that epoch.\r\nTrue dreamers of all ages have, for metaphysical reasons, imagined the\r\nexistence of intangible fluids in space--they had, indeed, peopled\r\nspace several times over with different kinds of ethers, as Maxwell\r\nremarks--but such vague dreamings no more constituted the discovery of\r\nthe modern ether than the dream of some pre-Columbian visionary that\r\nland might lie beyond the unknown waters constituted the discovery\r\nof America. In justice it must be admitted that Huyghens, the\r\nseventeenth-century originator of the undulatory theory of light, caught\r\na glimpse of the true ether; but his contemporaries and some eight\r\ngenerations of his successors were utterly deaf to his claims; so\r\nhe bears practically the same relation to the nineteenth-century\r\ndiscoverers of ether that the Norseman bears to Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe true Columbus of the ether was Thomas Young. His discovery was\r\nconsummated in the early days of the nineteenth century, when he brought\r\nforward the first, conclusive proofs of the undulatory theory of light.\r\nTo say that light consists of undulations is to postulate something that\r\nundulates; and this something could not be air, for air exists only in\r\ninfinitesimal quantity, if at all, in the interstellar spaces, through\r\nwhich light freely penetrates. But if not air, what then? Why, clearly,\r\nsomething more intangible than air; something supersensible, evading all\r\ndirect efforts to detect it, yet existing everywhere in seemingly\r\nvacant space, and also interpenetrating the substance of all transparent\r\nliquids and solids, if not, indeed, of all tangible substances. This\r\nintangible something Young rechristened the Luminiferous Ether.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of his discovery Young thought of the undulations\r\nwhich produce light and radiant heat as being longitudinal--a forward\r\nand backward pulsation, corresponding to the pulsations of sound--and as\r\nsuch pulsations can be transmitted by a fluid medium with the properties\r\nof ordinary fluids, he was justified in thinking of the ether as being\r\nlike a fluid in its properties, except for its extreme intangibility.\r\nBut about 1818 the experiments of Fresnel and Arago with polarization\r\nof light made it seem very doubtful whether the theory of longitudinal\r\nvibrations is sufficient, and it was suggested by Young, and\r\nindependently conceived and demonstrated by Fresnel, that the\r\nluminiferous undulations are not longitudinal, but transverse; and all\r\nthe more recent experiments have tended to confirm this view. But it\r\nhappens that ordinary fluids--gases and liquids--cannot transmit lateral\r\nvibrations; only rigid bodies are capable of such a vibration. So\r\nit became necessary to assume that the luminiferous ether is a body\r\npossessing elastic rigidity--a familiar property of tangible solids, but\r\none quite unknown among fluids.\r\n\r\nThe idea of transverse vibrations carried with it another puzzle. Why\r\ndoes not the ether, when set aquiver with the vibration which gives us\r\nthe sensation we call light, have produced in its substance subordinate\r\nquivers, setting out at right angles from the path of the original\r\nquiver? Such perpendicular vibrations seem not to exist, else we might\r\nsee around a corner; how explain their absence? The physicist could\r\nthink of but one way: they must assume that the ether is incompressible.\r\nIt must fill all space--at any rate, all space with which human\r\nknowledge deals--perfectly full.\r\n\r\nThese properties of the ether, incompressibility and elastic rigidity,\r\nare quite conceivable by themselves; but difficulties of thought appear\r\nwhen we reflect upon another quality which the ether clearly\r\nmust possess--namely, frictionlessness. By hypothesis this rigid,\r\nincompressible body pervades all space, imbedding every particle of\r\ntangible matter; yet it seems not to retard the movements of this matter\r\nin the slightest degree. This is undoubtedly the most difficult to\r\ncomprehend of the alleged properties of the ether. The physicist\r\nexplains it as due to the perfect elasticity of the ether, in virtue\r\nof which it closes in behind a moving particle with a push exactly\r\ncounterbalancing the stress required to penetrate it in front.\r\n\r\nTo a person unaccustomed to think of seemingly solid matter as really\r\ncomposed of particles relatively wide apart, it is hard to understand\r\nthe claim that ether penetrates the substance of solids--of glass,\r\nfor example--and, to use Young's expression, which we have previously\r\nquoted, moves among them as freely as the wind moves through a grove\r\nof trees. This thought, however, presents few difficulties to the mind\r\naccustomed to philosophical speculation. But the question early arose\r\nin the mind of Fresnel whether the ether is not considerably affected by\r\ncontact with the particles of solids. Some of his experiments led him to\r\nbelieve that a portion of the ether which penetrates among the molecules\r\nof tangible matter is held captive, so to speak, and made to move along\r\nwith these particles. He spoke of such portions of the ether as \"bound\"\r\nether, in contradistinction to the great mass of \"free\" ether. Half a\r\ncentury after Fresnel's death, when the ether hypothesis had become\r\nan accepted tenet of science, experiments were undertaken by Fizeau\r\nin France, and by Clerk-Maxwell in England, to ascertain whether any\r\nportion of ether is really thus bound to particles of matter; but the\r\nresults of the experiments were negative, and the question is still\r\nundetermined.\r\n\r\nWhile the undulatory theory of light was still fighting its way, another\r\nkind of evidence favoring the existence of an ether was put forward by\r\nMichael Faraday, who, in the course of his experiments in electrical and\r\nmagnetic induction, was led more and more to perceive definite lines or\r\nchannels of force in the medium subject to electro-magnetic influence.\r\nFaraday's mind, like that of Newton and many other philosophers,\r\nrejected the idea of action at a distance, and he felt convinced that\r\nthe phenomena of magnetism and of electric induction told strongly for\r\nthe existence of an invisible plenum everywhere in space, which might\r\nvery probably be the same plenum that carries the undulations of light\r\nand radiant heat.\r\n\r\nThen, about the middle of the century, came that final revolution of\r\nthought regarding the nature of energy which we have already outlined in\r\nthe preceding chapter, and with that the case for ether was considered\r\nto be fully established. The idea that energy is merely a \"mode\r\nof motion\" (to adopt Tyndall's familiar phrase), combined with the\r\nuniversal rejection of the notion of action at a distance, made the\r\nacceptance of a plenum throughout space a necessity of thought--so, at\r\nany rate, it has seemed to most physicists of recent decades. The proof\r\nthat all known forms of radiant energy move through space at the same\r\nrate of speed is regarded as practically a demonstration that but one\r\nplenum--one ether--is concerned in their transmission. It has, indeed,\r\nbeen tentatively suggested, by Professor J. Oliver Lodge, that there may\r\nbe two ethers, representing the two opposite kinds of electricity, but\r\neven the author of this hypothesis would hardly claim for it a high\r\ndegree of probability.\r\n\r\nThe most recent speculations regarding the properties of the ether have\r\ndeparted but little from the early ideas of Young and Fresnel. It is\r\nassumed on all sides that the ether is a continuous, incompressible\r\nbody, possessing rigidity and elasticity. Lord Kelvin has even\r\ncalculated the probable density of this ether, and its coefficient of\r\nrigidity. As might be supposed, it is all but infinitely tenuous as\r\ncompared with any tangible solid, and its rigidity is but infinitesimal\r\nas compared with that of steel. In a word, it combines properties of\r\ntangible matter in a way not known in any tangible substance. Therefore\r\nwe cannot possibly conceive its true condition correctly. The nearest\r\napproximation, according to Lord Kelvin, is furnished by a mould of\r\ntransparent jelly. It is a crude, inaccurate analogy, of course, the\r\ndensity and resistance of jelly in particular being utterly different\r\nfrom those of the ether; but the quivers that run through the jelly when\r\nit is shaken, and the elastic tension under which it is placed when its\r\nmass is twisted about, furnish some analogy to the quivers and strains\r\nin the ether, which are held to constitute radiant energy, magnetism,\r\nand electricity.\r\n\r\nThe great physicists of the day being at one regarding the existence of\r\nthis all-pervading ether, it would be a manifest presumption for any one\r\nstanding without the pale to challenge so firmly rooted a belief. And,\r\nindeed, in any event, there seems little ground on which to base such\r\na challenge. Yet it may not be altogether amiss to reflect that the\r\nphysicist of to-day is no more certain of his ether than was his\r\npredecessor of the eighteenth century of the existence of certain\r\nalleged substances which he called phlogiston, caloric, corpuscles of\r\nlight, and magnetic and electric fluids. It would be but the repetition\r\nof history should it chance that before the close of another century the\r\nether should have taken its place along with these discarded creations\r\nof the scientific imagination of earlier generations. The philosopher of\r\nto-day feels very sure that an ether exists; but when he says there is\r\n\"no doubt\" of its existence he speaks incautiously, and steps beyond the\r\nbounds of demonstration. He does not KNOW that action cannot take place\r\nat a distance; he does not KNOW that empty space itself may not perform\r\nthe functions which he ascribes to his space-filling ether.\r\n\r\nMeantime, however, the ether, be it substance or be it only dream-stuff,\r\nis serving an admirable purpose in furnishing a fulcrum for modern\r\nphysics. Not alone to the student of energy has it proved invaluable,\r\nbut to the student of matter itself as well. Out of its hypothetical\r\nmistiness has been reared the most tenable theory of the constitution of\r\nponderable matter which has yet been suggested--or, at any rate, the\r\none that will stand as the definitive nineteenth-century guess at\r\nthis \"riddle of the ages.\" I mean, of course, the vortex theory of\r\natoms--that profound and fascinating doctrine which suggests that\r\nmatter, in all its multiform phases, is neither more nor less than ether\r\nin motion.\r\n\r\nThe author of this wonderful conception is Lord Kelvin. The idea was\r\nborn in his mind of a happy union of mathematical calculations with\r\nconcrete experiments. The mathematical calculations were largely the\r\nwork of Hermann von Helmholtz, who, about the year 1858, had undertaken\r\nto solve some unique problems in vortex motions. Helmholtz found that\r\na vortex whirl, once established in a frictionless medium, must go on,\r\ntheoretically, unchanged forever. In a limited medium such a whirl may\r\nbe V-shaped, with its ends at the surface of the medium. We may imitate\r\nsuch a vortex by drawing the bowl of a spoon quickly through a cup\r\nof water. But in a limitless medium the vortex whirl must always be\r\na closed ring, which may take the simple form of a hoop or circle, or\r\nwhich may be indefinitely contorted, looped, or, so to speak, knotted.\r\nWhether simple or contorted, this endless chain of whirling matter (the\r\nparticles revolving about the axis of the loop as the particles of a\r\nstring revolve when the string is rolled between the fingers) must, in\r\na frictionless medium, retain its form and whirl on with undiminished\r\nspeed forever.\r\n\r\nWhile these theoretical calculations of Helmholtz were fresh in his\r\nmind, Lord Kelvin (then Sir William Thomson) was shown by Professor\r\nP. G. Tait, of Edinburgh, an apparatus constructed for the purpose\r\nof creating vortex rings in air. The apparatus, which any one may\r\nduplicate, consisted simply of a box with a hole bored in one side, and\r\na piece of canvas stretched across the opposite side in lieu of boards.\r\nFumes of chloride of ammonia are generated within the box, merely to\r\nrender the air visible. By tapping with the band on the canvas side\r\nof the box, vortex rings of the clouded air are driven out, precisely\r\nsimilar in appearance to those smoke-rings which some expert\r\ntobacco-smokers can produce by tapping on their cheeks, or to those\r\nlarger ones which we sometimes see blown out from the funnel of a\r\nlocomotive.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of Professor Tait's apparatus is its manageableness and\r\nthe certainty with which the desired result can be produced. Before Lord\r\nKelvin's interested observation it threw out rings of various sizes,\r\nwhich moved straight across the room at varying rates of speed,\r\naccording to the initial impulse, and which behaved very strangely when\r\ncoming in contact with one another. If, for example, a rapidly moving\r\nring overtook another moving in the same path, the one in advance seemed\r\nto pause, and to spread out its periphery like an elastic band, while\r\nthe pursuer seemed to contract, till it actually slid through the\r\norifice of the other, after which each ring resumed its original size,\r\nand continued its course as if nothing had happened. When, on the other\r\nhand, two rings moving in slightly different directions came near each\r\nother, they seemed to have an attraction for each other; yet if they\r\nimpinged, they bounded away, quivering like elastic solids. If an effort\r\nwere made to grasp or to cut one of these rings, the subtle thing shrank\r\nfrom the contact, and slipped away as if it were alive.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while the body which thus conducted itself consisted simply\r\nof a whirl in the air, made visible, but not otherwise influenced, by\r\nsmoky fumes. Presently the friction of the surrounding air wore the\r\nring away, and it faded into the general atmosphere--often, however, not\r\nuntil it had persisted for many seconds, and passed clear across a large\r\nroom. Clearly, if there were no friction, the ring's inertia must make\r\nit a permanent structure. Only the frictionless medium was lacking to\r\nfulfil all the conditions of Helmholtz's indestructible vortices. And\r\nat once Lord Kelvin bethought him of the frictionless medium which\r\nphysicists had now begun to accept--the all-pervading ether. What\r\nif vortex rings were started in this ether, must they not have the\r\nproperties which the vortex rings in air had exhibited--inertia,\r\nattraction, elasticity? And are not these the properties of ordinary\r\ntangible matter? Is it not probable, then, that what we call matter\r\nconsists merely of aggregations of infinitesimal vortex rings in the\r\nether?\r\n\r\nThus the vortex theory of atoms took form in Lord Kelvin's mind, and its\r\nexpression gave the world what many philosophers of our time regard as\r\nthe most plausible conception of the constitution of matter hitherto\r\nformulated. It is only a theory, to be sure; its author would be the\r\nlast person to claim finality for it. \"It is only a dream,\" Lord Kelvin\r\nsaid to me, in referring to it not long ago. But it has a basis in\r\nmathematical calculation and in analogical experiment such as no other\r\ntheory of matter can lay claim to, and it has a unifying or monistic\r\ntendency that makes it, for the philosophical mind, little less than\r\nfascinating. True or false, it is the definitive theory of matter of the\r\ntwentieth century.\r\n\r\nQuite aside from the question of the exact constitution of the ultimate\r\nparticles of matter, questions as to the distribution of such particles,\r\ntheir mutual relations, properties, and actions, came in for a full\r\nshare of attention during the nineteenth century, though the foundations\r\nfor the modern speculations were furnished in a previous epoch. The most\r\npopular eighteenth-century speculation as to the ultimate constitution\r\nof matter was that of the learned Italian priest, Roger Joseph\r\nBoscovich, published in 1758, in his Theoria Philosophiae Naturalis.\r\n\"In this theory,\" according to an early commentator, \"the whole mass of\r\nwhich the bodies of the universe are composed is supposed to consist\r\nof an exceedingly great yet finite number of simple, indivisible,\r\ninextended atoms. These atoms are endued by the Creator with REPULSIVE\r\nand ATTRACTIVE forces, which vary according to the distance. At very\r\nsmall distances the particles of matter repel each other; and this\r\nrepulsive force increases beyond all limits as the distances are\r\ndiminished, and will consequently forever prevent actual contact. When\r\nthe particles of matter are removed to sensible distances, the repulsive\r\nis exchanged for an attractive force, which decreases in inverse ratio\r\nwith the squares of the distances, and extends beyond the spheres of the\r\nmost remote comets.\"\r\n\r\nThis conception of the atom as a mere centre of force was hardly such\r\nas could satisfy any mind other than the metaphysical. No one made a\r\nconspicuous attempt to improve upon the idea, however, till just at the\r\nclose of the century, when Humphry Davy was led, in the course of\r\nhis studies of heat, to speculate as to the changes that occur in the\r\nintimate substance of matter under altered conditions of temperature.\r\nDavy, as we have seen, regarded heat as a manifestation of motion among\r\nthe particles of matter. As all bodies with which we come in contact\r\nhave some temperature, Davy inferred that the intimate particles of\r\nevery substance must be perpetually in a state of vibration. Such\r\nvibrations, he believed, produced the \"repulsive force\" which (in common\r\nwith Boscovich) he admitted as holding the particles of matter at a\r\ndistance from one another. To heat a substance means merely to increase\r\nthe rate of vibration of its particles; thus also, plainly, increasing\r\nthe repulsive forces and expanding the bulk of the mass as a whole. If\r\nthe degree of heat applied be sufficient, the repulsive force may become\r\nstrong enough quite to overcome the attractive force, and the particles\r\nwill separate and tend to fly away from one another, the solid then\r\nbecoming a gas.\r\n\r\nNot much attention was paid to these very suggestive ideas of Davy,\r\nbecause they were founded on the idea that heat is merely a motion,\r\nwhich the scientific world then repudiated; but half a century later,\r\nwhen the new theories of energy had made their way, there came a revival\r\nof practically the same ideas of the particles of matter (molecules they\r\nwere now called) which Davy had advocated. Then it was that Clausius in\r\nGermany and Clerk-Maxwell in England took up the investigation of\r\nwhat came to be known as the kinetic theory of gases--the now familiar\r\nconception that all the phenomena of gases are due to the helter-skelter\r\nflight of the showers of widely separated molecules of which they are\r\ncomposed. The specific idea that the pressure or \"spring\" of gases is\r\ndue to such molecular impacts was due to Daniel Bournelli, who advanced\r\nit early in the eighteenth century. The idea, then little noticed, had\r\nbeen revived about a century later by William Herapath, and again with\r\nsome success by J. J. Waterston, of Bombay, about 1846; but it gained\r\nno distinct footing until taken in hand by Clausius in 1857 and by\r\nClerk-Maxwell in 1859.\r\n\r\nThe considerations that led Clerk-Maxwell to take up the computations\r\nmay be stated in his own words, as formulated in a paper \"On the Motions\r\nand Collisions of Perfectly Elastic Spheres.\"\r\n\r\n\"So many of the properties of matter, especially when in the gaseous\r\nform,\" he says, \"can be deduced from the hypothesis that their minute\r\nparts are in rapid motion, the velocity increasing with the temperature,\r\nthat the precise nature of this motion becomes a subject of rational\r\ncuriosity. Daniel Bournelli, Herapath, Joule, Kronig, Clausius, etc.,\r\nhave shown that the relations between pressure, temperature, and density\r\nin a perfect gas can be explained by supposing the particles to move\r\nwith uniform velocities in straight lines, striking against the sides of\r\nthe containing vessel and thus producing pressure. It is not necessary\r\nto suppose each particle to travel to any great distance in the same\r\nstraight line; for the effect in producing pressure will be the same\r\nif the particles strike against each other; so that the straight line\r\ndescribed may be very short. M. Clausius has determined the mean length\r\nof path in terms of the average of the particles, and the distance\r\nbetween the centres of two particles when the collision takes place. We\r\nhave at present no means of ascertaining either of these distances;\r\nbut certain phenomena, such as the internal friction of gases, the\r\nconduction of heat through a gas, and the diffusion of one gas through\r\nanother, seem to indicate the possibility of determining accurately the\r\nmean length of path which a particle describes between two successive\r\ncollisions. In order to lay the foundation of such investigations on\r\nstrict mechanical principles, I shall demonstrate the laws of motion\r\nof an indefinite number of small, hard, and perfectly elastic spheres\r\nacting on one another only during impact. If the properties of such a\r\nsystem of bodies are found to correspond to those of gases, an important\r\nphysical analogy will be established, which may lead to more accurate\r\nknowledge of the properties of matter. If experiments on gases are\r\ninconsistent with the hypothesis of these propositions, then our theory,\r\nthough consistent with itself, is proved to be incapable of explaining\r\nthe phenomena of gases. In either case it is necessary to follow out\r\nthese consequences of the hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of saying that the particles are hard, spherical, and elastic,\r\nwe may, if we please, say the particles are centres of force, of which\r\nthe action is insensible except at a certain very small distance, when\r\nit suddenly appears as a repulsive force of very great intensity. It is\r\nevident that either assumption will lead to the same results. For the\r\nsake of avoiding the repetition of a long phrase about these repulsive\r\nbodies, I shall proceed upon the assumption of perfectly elastic\r\nspherical bodies. If we suppose those aggregate molecules which move\r\ntogether to have a bounding surface which is not spherical, then the\r\nrotatory motion of the system will close up a certain proportion of the\r\nwhole vis viva, as has been shown by Clausius, and in this way we may\r\naccount for the value of the specific heat being greater than on the\r\nmore simple hypothesis.\"(1)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elaborate investigations of Clerk-Maxwell served not merely to\r\nsubstantiate the doctrine, but threw a flood of light upon the entire\r\nsubject of molecular dynamics. Soon the physicists came to feel as\r\ncertain of the existence of these showers of flying molecules making up\r\na gas as if they could actually see and watch their individual actions.\r\nThrough study of the viscosity of gases--that is to say, of the degree\r\nof frictional opposition they show to an object moving through them\r\nor to another current of gas--an idea was gained, with the aid of\r\nmathematics, of the rate of speed at which the particles of the gas are\r\nmoving, and the number of collisions which each particle must experience\r\nin a given time, and of the length of the average free path traversed\r\nby the molecule between collisions, These measurements were confirmed\r\nby study of the rate of diffusion at which different gases mix together,\r\nand also by the rate of diffusion of heat through a gas, both these\r\nphenomena being chiefly due to the helter-skelter flight of the\r\nmolecules.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficiently astonishing to be told that such measurements as\r\nthese have been made at all, but the astonishment grows when one hears\r\nthe results. It appears from Clerk-Maxwell's calculations that the mean\r\nfree path, or distance traversed by the molecules between collisions in\r\nordinary air, is about one-half-millionth of an inch; while the speed of\r\nthe molecules is such that each one experiences about eight billions\r\nof collisions per second! It would be hard, perhaps, to cite an\r\nillustration showing the refinements of modern physics better than\r\nthis; unless, indeed, one other result that followed directly from these\r\ncalculations be considered such--the feat, namely, of measuring the size\r\nof the molecules themselves. Clausius was the first to point out how\r\nthis might be done from a knowledge of the length of free path; and the\r\ncalculations were made by Loschmidt in Germany and by Lord Kelvin in\r\nEngland, independently.\r\n\r\nThe work is purely mathematical, of course, but the results are regarded\r\nas unassailable; indeed, Lord Kelvin speaks of them as being absolutely\r\ndemonstrative within certain limits of accuracy. This does not mean,\r\nhowever, that they show the exact dimensions of the molecule; it means\r\nan estimate of the limits of size within which the actual size of the\r\nmolecule may lie. These limits, Lord Kelvin estimates, are about\r\nthe one-ten-millionth of a centimetre for the maximum, and the\r\none-one-hundred-millionth of a centimetre for the minimum. Such figures\r\nconvey no particular meaning to our blunt senses, but Lord Kelvin has\r\ngiven a tangible illustration that aids the imagination to at least a\r\nvague comprehension of the unthinkable smallness of the molecule. He\r\nestimates that if a ball, say of water or glass, about \"as large as\r\na football, were to be magnified up to the size of the earth, each\r\nconstituent molecule being magnified in the same proportion, the\r\nmagnified structure would be more coarse-grained than a heap of shot,\r\nbut probably less coarse-grained than a heap of footballs.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other methods have been employed to estimate the size of\r\nmolecules. One of these is based upon the phenomena of contact\r\nelectricity; another upon the wave-theory of light; and another upon\r\ncapillary attraction, as shown in the tense film of a soap-bubble! No\r\none of these methods gives results more definite than that due to the\r\nkinetic theory of gases, just outlined; but the important thing is that\r\nthe results obtained by these different methods (all of them due to Lord\r\nKelvin) agree with one another in fixing the dimensions of the molecule\r\nat somewhere about the limits already mentioned. We may feel very sure\r\nindeed, therefore, that the molecules of matter are not the unextended,\r\nformless points which Boscovich and his followers of the eighteenth\r\ncentury thought them. But all this, it must be borne in mind, refers\r\nto the molecule, not to the ultimate particle of matter, about which we\r\nshall have more to say in another connection. Curiously enough, we shall\r\nfind that the latest theories as to the final term of the series are\r\nnot so very far afield from the dreamings of the eighteenth-century\r\nphilosophers; the electron of J. J. Thompson shows many points of\r\nresemblance to the formless centre of Boscovich.\r\n\r\nWhatever the exact form of the molecule, its outline is subject to\r\nincessant variation; for nothing in molecular science is regarded as\r\nmore firmly established than that the molecule, under all ordinary\r\ncircumstances, is in a state of intense but variable vibration. The\r\nentire energy of a molecule of gas, for example, is not measured by its\r\nmomentum, but by this plus its energy of vibration and rotation, due\r\nto the collisions already referred to. Clausius has even estimated\r\nthe relative importance of these two quantities, showing that the\r\ntranslational motion of a molecule of gas accounts for only three-fifths\r\nof its kinetic energy. The total energy of the molecule (which we call\r\n\"heat\") includes also another factor--namely, potential energy, or\r\nenergy of position, due to the work that has been done on expanding,\r\nin overcoming external pressure, and internal attraction between the\r\nmolecules themselves. This potential energy (which will be recovered\r\nwhen the gas contracts) is the \"latent heat\" of Black, which so long\r\npuzzled the philosophers. It is latent in the same sense that the energy\r\nof a ball thrown into the air is latent at the moment when the ball\r\npoises at its greatest height before beginning to fall.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that a variety of motions, real and potential, enter\r\ninto the production of the condition we term heat. It is, however,\r\nchiefly the translational motion which is measurable as temperature;\r\nand this, too, which most obviously determines the physical state of the\r\nsubstance that the molecules collectively compose--whether, that is to\r\nsay, it shall appear to our blunt perceptions as a gas, a liquid, or a\r\nsolid. In the gaseous state, as we have seen, the translational motion\r\nof the molecules is relatively enormous, the molecules being widely\r\nseparated. It does not follow, as we formerly supposed, that this\r\nis evidence of a repulsive power acting between the molecules. The\r\nphysicists of to-day, headed by Lord Kelvin, decline to recognize any\r\nsuch power. They hold that the molecules of a gas fly in straight lines\r\nby virtue of their inertia, quite independently of one another, except\r\nat times of collision, from which they rebound by virtue of their\r\nelasticity; or on an approach to collision, in which latter case, coming\r\nwithin the range of mutual attraction, two molecules may circle about\r\neach other, as a comet circles about the sun, then rush apart again, as\r\nthe comet rushes from the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the length of the mean free path of the molecules\r\nof a gas may be increased indefinitely by decreasing the number of the\r\nmolecules themselves in a circumscribed space. It has been shown by\r\nProfessors Tait and Dewar that a vacuum may be produced artificially of\r\nsuch a degree of rarefaction that the mean free path of the remaining\r\nmolecules is measurable in inches. The calculation is based on\r\nexperiments made with the radiometer of Professor Crookes, an instrument\r\nwhich in itself is held to demonstrate the truth of the kinetic theory\r\nof gases. Such an attenuated gas as this is considered by Professor\r\nCrookes as constituting a fourth state of matter, which he terms\r\nultra-gaseous.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, a gas is subjected to pressure, its molecules are\r\ncrowded closer together, and the length of their mean free path is thus\r\nlessened. Ultimately, the pressure being sufficient, the molecules are\r\npractically in continuous contact. Meantime the enormously increased\r\nnumber of collisions has set the molecules more and more actively\r\nvibrating, and the temperature of the gas has increased, as, indeed,\r\nnecessarily results in accordance with the law of the conservation\r\nof energy. No amount of pressure, therefore, can suffice by itself to\r\nreduce the gas to a liquid state. It is believed that even at the centre\r\nof the sun, where the pressure is almost inconceivably great, all matter\r\nis to be regarded as really gaseous, though the molecules must be so\r\npacked together that the consistency is probably more like that of a\r\nsolid.\r\n\r\nIf, however, coincidently with the application of pressure, opportunity\r\nbe given for the excess of heat to be dissipated to a colder surrounding\r\nmedium, the molecules, giving off their excess of energy, become\r\nrelatively quiescent, and at a certain stage the gas becomes a liquid.\r\nThe exact point at which this transformation occurs, however, differs\r\nenormously for different substances. In the case of water, for\r\nexample, it is a temperature more than four hundred degrees above zero,\r\ncentigrade; while for atmospheric air it is one hundred and ninety-four\r\ndegrees centigrade below zero, or more than a hundred and fifty degrees\r\nbelow the point at which mercury freezes.\r\n\r\nBe it high or low, the temperature above which any substance is always\r\na gas, regardless of pressure, is called the critical temperature, or\r\nabsolute boiling-point, of that substance. It does not follow, however,\r\nthat below this point the substance is necessarily a liquid. This is a\r\nmatter that will be determined by external conditions of pressure. Even\r\nfar below the critical temperature the molecules have an enormous degree\r\nof activity, and tend to fly asunder, maintaining what appears to be\r\na gaseous, but what technically is called a vaporous, condition--the\r\ndistinction being that pressure alone suffices to reduce the vapor to\r\nthe liquid state. Thus water may change from the gaseous to the liquid\r\nstate at four hundred degrees above zero, but under conditions of\r\nordinary atmospheric pressure it does not do so until the temperature\r\nis lowered three hundred degrees further. Below four hundred degrees,\r\nhowever, it is technically a vapor, not a gas; but the sole difference,\r\nit will be understood, is in the degree of molecular activity.\r\n\r\nIt thus appeared that the prevalence of water in a vaporous and liquid\r\nrather than in a \"permanently\" gaseous condition here on the globe is a\r\nmere incident of telluric evolution. Equally incidental is the fact that\r\nthe air we breathe is \"permanently\" gaseous and not liquid or solid,\r\nas it might be were the earth's surface temperature to be lowered to a\r\ndegree which, in the larger view, may be regarded as trifling. Between\r\nthe atmospheric temperature in tropical and in arctic regions there is\r\noften a variation of more than one hundred degrees; were the temperature\r\nreduced another hundred, the point would be reached at which oxygen\r\ngas becomes a vapor, and under increased pressure would be a liquid.\r\nThirty-seven degrees more would bring us to the critical temperature of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nNor is this a mere theoretical assumption; it is a determination of\r\nexperimental science, quite independent of theory. The physicist in the\r\nlaboratory has produced artificial conditions of temperature enabling\r\nhim to change the state of the most persistent gases. Some fifty years\r\nsince, when the kinetic theory was in its infancy, Faraday liquefied\r\ncarbonic-acid gas, among others, and the experiments thus inaugurated\r\nhave been extended by numerous more recent investigators, notably\r\nby Cailletet in Switzerland, by Pictet in France, and by Dr. Thomas.\r\nAndrews and Professor James Dewar in England. In the course of these\r\nexperiments not only has air been liquefied, but hydrogen also, the most\r\nsubtle of gases; and it has been made more and more apparent that gas\r\nand liquid are, as Andrews long ago asserted, \"only distant stages of\r\na long series of continuous physical changes.\" Of course, if the\r\ntemperature be lowered still further, the liquid becomes a solid; and\r\nthis change also has been effected in the case of some of the most\r\n\"permanent\" gases, including air.\r\n\r\nThe degree of cold--that is, of absence of heat--thus produced is\r\nenormous, relatively to anything of which we have experience in nature\r\nhere at the earth now, yet the molecules of solidified air, for\r\nexample, are not absolutely quiescent. In other words, they still have\r\na temperature, though so very low. But it is clearly conceivable that\r\na stage might be reached at which the molecules became absolutely\r\nquiescent, as regards either translational or vibratory motion. Such a\r\nheatless condition has been approached, but as yet not quite\r\nattained, in laboratory experiments. It is called the absolute zero\r\nof temperature, and is estimated to be equivalent to two hundred and\r\nseventy-three degrees Centigrade below the freezing-point of water, or\r\nordinary zero.\r\n\r\nA temperature (or absence of temperature) closely approximating this\r\nis believed to obtain in the ethereal ocean of interplanetary and\r\ninterstellar space, which transmits, but is thought not to absorb,\r\nradiant energy. We here on the earth's surface are protected from\r\nexposure to this cold, which would deprive every organic thing of life\r\nalmost instantaneously, solely by the thin blanket of atmosphere with\r\nwhich the globe is coated. It would seem as if this atmosphere,\r\nexposed to such a temperature at its surface, must there be incessantly\r\nliquefied, and thus fall back like rain to be dissolved into gas again\r\nwhile it still is many miles above the earth's surface. This may be the\r\nreason why its scurrying molecules have not long ago wandered off into\r\nspace and left the world without protection.\r\n\r\nBut whether or not such liquefaction of the air now occurs in our outer\r\natmosphere, there can be no question as to what must occur in its entire\r\ndepth were we permanently shut off from the heating influence of the\r\nsun, as the astronomers threaten that we may be in a future age.\r\nEach molecule, not alone of the atmosphere, but of the entire earth's\r\nsubstance, is kept aquiver by the energy which it receives, or has\r\nreceived, directly or indirectly, from the sun. Left to itself, each\r\nmolecule would wear out its energy and fritter it off into the\r\nspace about it, ultimately running completely down, as surely as any\r\nhuman-made machine whose power is not from time to time restored. If,\r\nthen, it shall come to pass in some future age that the sun's rays\r\nfail us, the temperature of the globe must gradually sink towards the\r\nabsolute zero. That is to say, the molecules of gas which now fly about\r\nat such inconceivable speed must drop helpless to the earth; liquids\r\nmust in turn become solids; and solids themselves, their molecular\r\nquivers utterly stilled, may perhaps take on properties the nature of\r\nwhich we cannot surmise.\r\n\r\nYet even then, according to the current hypothesis, the heatless\r\nmolecule will still be a thing instinct with life. Its vortex whirl will\r\nstill go on, uninfluenced by the dying-out of those subordinate quivers\r\nthat produced the transitory effect which we call temperature. For those\r\ntransitory thrills, though determining the physical state of matter as\r\nmeasured by our crude organs of sense, were no more than non-essential\r\nincidents; but the vortex whirl is the essence of matter itself. Some\r\nestimates as to the exact character of this intramolecular motion,\r\ntogether with recent theories as to the actual structure of the\r\nmolecule, will claim our attention in a later volume. We shall also\r\nhave occasion in another connection to make fuller inquiry as to the\r\nphenomena of low temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n  REFERENCE-LIST\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n  THE SUCCESSORS OF NEWTON IN ASTRONOMY (1) (p. 10).
