On the one\r\nhand, there was the natural desire to interfere as little as possible\r\nwith the original work; and on the other, the necessity of rendering\r\navailable, to some extent at least, the enormous advance in every\r\ndepartment which has taken place in the thirty-six years which have\r\nelapsed since the work was first offered to the public. The reviser has\r\ndone his best not only to fulfil these two objects, but to keep in view\r\nthe original purpose of the book.\r\n\r\nIn the popular department of pond-life especially, about fifty new\r\nillustrations have been added, mostly from the reviser’s own notebook\r\nsketches. The whole of the botanical part has been revised by one of\r\nour first English authorities, and, in short, no effort has been spared\r\nto make the work as accurate as its necessarily condensed form permits\r\nof. It is hoped, therefore, that it may be found not less useful than\r\nits predecessor by those for whom it is alone intended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my two previous handbooks, the “Common Objects” of the Sea-shore and\r\nCountry, I could but slightly glance at the minute beings which swarm\r\nin every locality, or at the wonderful structures which are discovered\r\nby the Microscope within or upon the creatures therein described. Since\r\nthat time a general demand has arisen for an elementary handbook upon\r\nthe Microscope and its practical appliance to the study of nature, and\r\nin order to supply that want this little volume has been produced.\r\n\r\nI must warn the reader that he is not to expect a work that will figure\r\nand describe every object which may be found on the sea-shore or in the\r\nfields, but merely one by which he will be enabled to guide himself\r\nin microscopical research, and avoid the loss of time and patience\r\nwhich is almost invariably the lot of the novice in these interesting\r\nstudies. Upwards of four hundred objects have been figured, including\r\nmany representatives of the animal, vegetable, and, mineral kingdoms,\r\nand among them the reader will find types sufficient for his early\r\nguidance.\r\n\r\nNeither must he expect that any drawings can fully render the lovely\r\nstructures which are revealed by the microscope. Their form can be\r\ngiven faithfully enough, and their colour can be indicated; but no pen,\r\npencil, or brush, however skilfully wielded, can reproduce the soft,\r\nglowing radiance, the delicate pearly translucency, or the flashing\r\neffulgence of living and ever-changing light with which God wills to\r\nimbue even the smallest of His creatures, whose very existence has been\r\nhidden for countless ages from the inquisitive research of man, and\r\nwhose wondrous beauty astonishes and delights the eye, and fills the\r\nheart with awe and adoration.\r\n\r\nOwing to the many claims on my time, I left the selection of the\r\nobjects to Mr. Tuffen West, who employed the greater part of a year\r\nin collecting specimens for the express purpose, and whose well-known\r\nfidelity and wide experience are the best guarantees that can be\r\noffered to the public. To him I also owe many thanks for his kind\r\nrevision of the proof-sheets. My thanks are also due to Messrs. G. and\r\nH. Brady, who lent many beautiful objects, and to Messrs. Baker, the\r\nwell-known opticians of Holborn, who liberally placed their whole stock\r\nof slides and instruments at my disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I

MICROSCOPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nPleasures and Uses of Microscopy--Development of the\r\nMicroscope--Extemporised Apparatus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last half-century the use of the microscope, not only as\r\nan instrument of scientific research, a tool in the hands of the\r\ninvestigator of the finer organisation of the world of nature, nor even\r\nas an adjunct to the apparatus of the chemist or the manufacturer, but\r\nas a means of innocent and instructive recreation, has become so firmly\r\nrooted amongst us that it seems hardly necessary to advocate its claims\r\nto attention on any of these grounds.\r\n\r\nSo wonderful is the information which it affords, so indispensable is\r\nit in many, if not in all, branches of scientific research, that not\r\nonly would the lover of nature be deprived of one of his most valued\r\nsources of information and enjoyment, but some sciences would be\r\nbrought absolutely to a standstill if by any conceivable means the\r\nmicroscope were to be withdrawn from their followers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, from every improvement in the construction of the\r\nlatter, a corresponding enlargement and enlightenment of the fields\r\nreviewed by these sciences has taken place, and the beauty and interest\r\nof the revelations made by its means has attracted an ever-increasing\r\nhost of earnest and intelligent volunteers, who have rendered yeoman\r\nservice to the cause of knowledge.\r\n\r\nMoreover, so vast is the scope of the instrument, that whilst\r\ndiscoveries in other fields of research are few and far between,\r\ncomparatively speaking, in microscopic science they are of everyday\r\noccurrence, and the number of problems calling for solution by means of\r\nthe instrument in question is so vast that even the humblest worker may\r\nbe of the greatest assistance.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we propose to carry out, as far as possible\r\nwith reference to the microscope, the system followed in the “Common\r\nObjects of the Seashore and of the Country,” and to treat in as simple\r\na manner as may be of the marvellous structures which are found so\r\nprofusely in our fields, woods, streams, shores, and gardens. Moreover,\r\nour observations will be restricted to an instrument of such a class as\r\nto be inexpensively purchased and easily handled, and to those pieces\r\nof supplementary apparatus which can be extemporised at small cost\r\nof money and ingenuity by the observer himself, or obtained of the\r\nopticians for a few shillings.\r\n\r\nWith the same view, the descriptions will be given in language as\r\nsimple and as free from technicalities as possible, though it must\r\nbe remembered that for many of the organisms and structures which we\r\nshall have to describe there are none but scientific names; and since,\r\nmoreover, this little work is intended to furnish a stepping-stone\r\nbetween the very elements of microscopic science, and those higher\r\ndevelopments of it which should be the aim of every worker, it would be\r\nunwise to attempt to invent commonplace appellations for the purpose of\r\nthis book, and leave him to discover, when he came to consult works of\r\nreference in any particular subject, that his “simplified” knowledge\r\nhad all to be unlearnt, and a new vocabulary acquired. Rather will\r\nit be our purpose to use correct terms, and explain them, as far as\r\nnecessary, as we introduce them.\r\n\r\nThe commencing microscopist is strongly recommended, whilst not\r\nconfining his interest entirely to one branch of research or\r\nobservation, to adopt some one as his particular province.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for discovery and original work, which are afforded\r\nby all alike, will be more readily appreciated and utilised by\r\nadopting such a plan than by a general and purposeless distribution of\r\neffort. To mention one or two. The student of the fascinating field of\r\npond-life will find new organisms awaiting description by the hundred,\r\nand of the old ones, life-histories to make out; if he be attracted\r\nrather to the vegetable inhabitants of the same realm, the diatoms will\r\nfurnish him with the opportunity of studying, and perhaps solving,\r\nthe enigma of their spontaneous movement, and of watching their\r\ndevelopment. The smaller fungi, and indeed the larger ones too, will\r\namply repay the closest and most laborious study of their habits of\r\nlife and processes of development. Since the first edition of this work\r\nwas published, the whole subject has been practically revolutionised,\r\nand more remains to be done than has yet been accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is scarcely an organism, even of those best known\r\nand most studied, which is so completely exhausted that persevering\r\ninvestigation would reveal nothing new concerning it.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt but that if any worker, with moderate\r\ninstrumental means, but with an observant mind, were to set\r\ndeterminately to work at the study of the commonest weed or the most\r\nfamiliar insect, he, or she, would by patient labour accomplish work\r\nwhich would not only be of value to science, but would redound to the\r\ncredit of the worker.\r\n\r\nSomething like finality appears to have been reached, at least for the\r\npresent, in the development of the microscope; and whilst it is beyond\r\nthe scope of this work to treat of the refined and costly apparatus\r\nwhich is essential to useful work in certain departments of research,\r\nthe result has, on the whole, been highly favourable to the worker of\r\nmoderate means and ambitions, since lenses are now accessible, at the\r\ncost of a few shillings, comparatively speaking, which could not have\r\nbeen purchased at all when this work first appeared. It is with such\r\nappliances that we have here to deal. The worker whose finances are\r\nrestricted must be contented to extemporise for himself many pieces\r\nof apparatus, and will find pleasure and occupation in doing so. And\r\nlet him remember, for his encouragement, that many such home-made\r\nappliances will fulfil their purpose quite as well as the imposing\r\nparaphernalia of glittering brass and glass which decorates the table\r\nof the wealthy amateur. It is not the man who possesses the best or\r\nmost costly apparatus, but the one who best understands the use of that\r\nwhich he possesses, that will make the most successful microscopist. A\r\ngood observer will discover, with only the aid of a pocket-magnifier,\r\nsecrets of Nature which have escaped the notice of a whole army of\r\ndilettante microscopists, in spite of the advantages which, as regards\r\ninstruments, the latter may enjoy.\r\n\r\nIt is for those who desire to be of the former class that this book\r\nis written, and in the course of the following pages instances will\r\nbe given in which the exercise of a small amount of ingenuity and the\r\nexpenditure of a few pence will be found equivalent to the purchase of\r\ncostly and complicated apparatus.\r\n\r\nAn enormous amount of valuable work was done in the earliest days\r\nof microscopy, when the best apparatus available was a single lens,\r\ncomposed of the bead formed by fusing the drawn-out end of a rod\r\nof glass. Inserted into a plate of metal, or a piece of card, such\r\na primitive instrument was capable of affording a large amount of\r\ninformation. Similar instruments are to be purchased for a few pence\r\nat the present day, and are not without their use for purposes of\r\nimmediate examination of material. A very common form is a glass\r\nmarble, ground flat on one side, and mounted in a tube. The material to\r\nbe examined is placed upon the flat side, and is seen magnified to an\r\nextent inversely proportional to the diameter of the sphere of glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  Elementary Principles of Optics--Simple Microscopes--Compound\r\n  Microscope--Accessory Apparatus--Cover-glasses--Troughs--\r\n  Condensers--Dissection--Dipping-tubes--Drawing--Measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to deal with the microscope itself, it may be useful\r\nto give a short summary of the optical laws upon which its working\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nTo go into the minutiæ of the matter here would be out of place, but it\r\nwill be found very helpful, especially in the matter of illumination,\r\nto acquire some knowledge of, and facility in applying, these\r\nelementary principles. We shall confine our remarks to convex lenses,\r\nas being the form to which all the combinations in the microscope may\r\nbe ultimately reduced.\r\n\r\nEvery convex lens has one “principal” focus, and an infinite number\r\nof “conjugate” foci. The principal focus is the distance at which it\r\nbrings together in one point the rays which fall upon it parallel to\r\nits axis, as shown in Fig. 1, in which _A_ is the axis of the lens _L_,\r\nand the rays _RR_ are brought together in the principal focus _P_. Thus\r\na ready means of finding the focal length of any lens is to see at what\r\ndistance it forms an image of the sun, or of any other distant object,\r\nupon a screen, such as a piece of smooth white cardboard. In the figure\r\nthis distance will be _PL_. Conversely, if the source of light be at\r\n_P_, a parallel beam of light will be emitted from the lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe focal length may, however, be found in another way. When an object\r\nis placed at a distance from a lens equal to twice the principal focal\r\nlength of the latter, an image of the object is formed at the same\r\ndistance upon the other side of the lens, inverted in position, but of\r\nthe same dimensions as the original object. The object and image then\r\noccupy the equal conjugate foci of the lens, so that by causing them\r\nto assume these relative positions, and halving the distance at which\r\neither of them is from the lens, the focal length of the latter is\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThese points will be seen on reference to Fig. 2, in which _L_ being\r\nthe lens, and _P_ the principal focus, as before, rays from the point\r\n_C_ are brought together at the conjugate focus _C'_, at the same\r\ndistance on the other side of _L_. In this case it manifestly does not\r\nmatter whether the object be at one or the other of these points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nSo far we have been dealing with points on the line of the axis of the\r\nlens. The facts mentioned apply equally, however, to rays entering the\r\nlens at an angle to the axis, only that in this case they diverge or\r\nconverge, correspondingly, upon the other side. It is evident, from\r\nFig. 1, that no image is formed of a point situated at the distance\r\nof the principal focus; but Fig. 3, which is really an extension\r\nof Fig. 2, shows how the rays passing along secondary axes form an\r\ninverted image of the same size as the object, when the latter is\r\nsituated at twice the focal length of the lens from this last. To\r\navoid confusion, the bounding lines only are shown, but similar lines\r\nmight be drawn from each and every point of the object; and if the\r\nlines _ALA'_, _BL'B'_ be supposed to be balanced at _L_ and _L'_\r\nrespectively, they will indicate the points at which the corresponding\r\nparts of the object and image will be situated along the lines _AB_,\r\n_B'A'_ respectively. Moreover, rays pass from every part of the object\r\nto every part of the lens, so that we must imagine the cones _LAL'_,\r\n_LA'L'_ to be filled with rays diverging on one side of the lens and\r\nconverging on the other.\r\n\r\nThe image so formed is a “real” image,--that is to say, it can be\r\nthrown upon a screen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe microscopic image, on the other hand, is a virtual image, which can\r\nbe viewed by the eye but cannot be thus projected, for it is formed by\r\nan object placed nearer to the lens than the principal focal length of\r\nthe latter, so that the rays diverge, instead of converging, as they\r\nleave the lens, and the eye looks, as it were, back along the path in\r\nwhich the rays appear to travel, and so sees an enlarged image situated\r\nin the air, farther away than the object, as shown in Fig. 4. In this\r\ncase, as the diagram shows, the image is upright, not inverted.\r\n\r\nImages of the latter class are those formed by simple microscopes, of\r\nthe kind described in the previous chapter. In the compound microscope\r\nthe initial image, formed by the object-glass, is further magnified by\r\nanother set of lenses, forming the eye-piece, by which the diverging\r\nrays of the virtual image are brought together to a focus at the\r\neye-point; and when viewed directly, the eye sees an imaginary image,\r\nas in a simple microscope, whilst, when the rays are allowed to fall\r\nupon a screen, they form a real image of the object, larger or smaller,\r\nas the screen is farther from or nearer to the eye-point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nThese remarks must suffice for our present purpose. Those who are\r\nsufficiently interested in the subject to desire to know more of the\r\ndelicate corrections to which these broad principles are subjected in\r\npractice, that objectives may give images which are clear and free from\r\ncolour, to say nothing of other faults, will do well to consult some\r\nsuch work as Lommel’s _Optics_, in the International Science Series.\r\n\r\nIn following a work such as the present one, the simple microscope,\r\nin some form or other, will be found almost indispensable. It will be\r\nrequired for examining raw material, such as leaves or other parts of\r\nplants, for gatherings of life in fresh or salt water, for dissections.\r\nWith such powers as those with which we shall have to deal, it will\r\nrarely happen that, for example, a bottle of water in which no life is\r\nvisible will be worth the carrying-home; whilst, on the other hand, a\r\nfew months’ practice will render it not only possible, but easy, not\r\nonly to recognise the presence, but to identify the genus, and often\r\neven the species, of the forms of life present. Moreover, these low\r\npowers, affording a general view of the object, allow the relation\r\nto each other of the details revealed by the power of the compound\r\nmicroscope to be much more easily grasped. A rough example may suffice\r\nto illustrate this. A penny is a sufficiently evident object to the\r\nnaked eye, but it will require a sharp one to follow the details in\r\nBritannia’s shield, whilst the minute scratches or the bloom upon the\r\nsurface would be invisible in detail without optical aid. Conversely,\r\nhowever, it would be rash to conclude from an examination of a portion\r\nof the surface with the microscope alone that the portion in view was\r\na sample of the whole surface. The more the surface is magnified,\r\nthe less are the details grasped as a whole, and for this reason the\r\nobserver is strongly recommended to make out all that he can of an\r\nobject with a simple magnifier before resorting to the microscope.\r\n\r\nFor general purposes, the intending observer cannot do better than\r\nsupply himself with a common pocket-magnifier, with one, two, or three\r\nlenses, preferably the last, as although the absolute performance\r\nis not so accurate, the very considerable range of power available\r\nby using the lenses singly, or in various combinations, is of great\r\nadvantage. Such a magnifier may be obtained from Baker for about\r\nthree-and-sixpence, or, with the addition of a powerful Coddington lens\r\n(Fig. 5) in the same mount, for nine shillings more. Aplanatic lenses,\r\nsuch as the one shown in section in Fig. 6, with a much flatter field\r\nof vision, but of one power only each, cost about fifteen shillings,\r\nand a simple stand, which adapts them for dissecting purposes, may\r\nbe obtained of the same maker for half a crown, or may easily be\r\nextemporised from a cork sliding stiffly on an iron rod set in a heavy\r\nfoot, the cork carrying a loop of wire terminating in a ring which\r\ncarries the lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nSo much may suffice for the simple microscope. We pass on now to the\r\nconsideration of the instrument which forms the subject of the present\r\nwork, an instrument which, whilst moderate in price, is yet capable\r\nof doing a large amount of useful and valuable work in the hands of\r\na careful owner, and of affording him a vast amount of pleasure and\r\nrecreation, even if these be his only objects in the purchase, though\r\nit is difficult to understand that, an insight being once attained into\r\nthe revelations effected by the instrument, without a desire being\r\nexcited in any intelligent mind to pursue the subject as a study as\r\nwell as a delightful relaxation. The microscope described, and adopted\r\nas his text by the author of this work, is still made, and has shared\r\nto a very considerable extent in the general improvement of optical\r\napparatus which has taken place during the last thirty years. It is to\r\nbe obtained from Baker, 244 High Holborn, and is provided with most\r\nof the apparatus which will be found indispensable by the beginner,\r\ncosting, with a case in which to keep it, the modest sum of three\r\nguineas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nIf this instrument represent the limit of the purchaser’s power of\r\npurse, he may very well make it answer his purpose for a considerable\r\ntime. The same instrument, however, with separate objectives of good\r\nquality, together with a bull’s-eye condenser (an almost indispensable\r\nadjunct), a plane mirror in addition to a concave one, and a simple but\r\nefficient form of substage condenser, may be obtained for £5, 12s. 6d.,\r\nand the extra outlay will be well repaid by the advantage in working\r\nwhich is gained by the possession of the additional apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nA still better stand, and one which is good enough for almost any\r\nclass of work, is that shown in Fig. 8, which is known as the\r\n“Portable” microscope. In this instrument the body is made up of\r\ntwo tubes, so that the length may be varied at will, and this gives\r\na very considerable range of magnification without changing the\r\nobject-glass, a great convenience in practice; whilst the legs fold\r\nup for convenience of carriage, so that the whole instrument, with\r\nall necessary appliances, may be readily packed in a corner of a\r\nportmanteau for transport to the country or seaside.\r\n\r\nThe objectives supplied with the simplest form of microscope above\r\nreferred to are combinations of three powers in one, and the power is\r\nvaried by using one, two, or three of these in combination. This form\r\nof objective is very good, as far as it goes, though it is impossible\r\nto correct such a combination with the accuracy which is possible in\r\nmanufacturing one of a fixed focal length.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best thing for the beginner to do would be to purchase the\r\ncombination first, and, later on, to dispose of it and buy separate\r\nobjectives of, say, one-inch, half-inch, and quarter-inch focal\r\nlengths. It may be explained here, that when a lens is spoken of as\r\nhaving a certain focal length, it is meant that the magnification\r\nobtained by its use is the same, at a distance of ten inches from the\r\neye, as would be obtained by using a simple sphere of glass of the same\r\nfocal length at the same distance. This, of course, is simply a matter\r\nof theory, for such lenses are never used actually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nOf accessory apparatus, we may mention first the stage forceps (Fig. 9,\r\n_a_). These are made to fit into a hole upon the stage, so as to be\r\ncapable of being turned about in any direction, with an object in their\r\ngrasp, and for some purposes, especially such as the examination of a\r\nthin object, say the edge of a leaf, they are extremely useful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe live box, in which drops of water or portions of water-plants,\r\nor the like, may be examined, will be found of great service. By\r\nadjustment of the cap upon the cylinder, with proper attention to\r\nthe thickness of the cover-glass in the cap, any required amount of\r\npressure, from that merely sufficient to fix a restless object to an\r\namount sufficient to crush a resistent tissue, may easily be applied,\r\nwhilst the result of the operation is watched through the microscope.\r\nThis proceeding is greatly facilitated if the cap of the live-box be\r\nslotted spirally, with a stud on the cylinder, so that a half-turn of\r\nthe cap brings the glasses into contact. By this means the pressure may\r\nbe adjusted with the greatest nicety.\r\n\r\nIn examining delicate objects, such as large infusoria, which\r\ninvariably commit suicide when pressure is applied, a good plan is to\r\nrestrict their movements by placing a few threads of cotton-wool, well\r\npulled out, in the live-box with the drop of water.\r\n\r\nA variety of instruments has been invented for the same purpose, of\r\nwhich Beck’s parallel compressorium may be mentioned as the most\r\nefficient, though it is somewhat complicated, and consequently\r\nexpensive, costing about twenty-five shillings.\r\n\r\nA few glass slips and cover-glasses will also be required. The latter\r\nhad better be those known as “No. 2,” since the beginner will find it\r\nalmost impossible to clean the thinner ones satisfactorily without\r\na large percentage of fractures. The safest way is to boil the thin\r\nglass circles in dilute nitric acid (half acid, half water) for a\r\nfew minutes, wash well in several waters, first tap-water and then\r\ndistilled, and finally to place the covers in methylated spirit. When\r\nrequired for use, the spirit may be burnt off by applying a light, the\r\ncover-glass, held in a pair of forceps, being in no way injured by the\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the glass slides, the observer will find it advisable to\r\nbe provided with a few glass troughs, of various thicknesses, in which\r\nportions of water-plants, having organisms attached to them, may be\r\nexamined. Confined in the live-box, many of the organisms ordinarily\r\nfound under such circumstances can rarely be induced to unfold their\r\nbeauties, whilst in the comparative freedom of the trough they do so\r\nreadily. The troughs may be purchased, or may be made of any desired\r\nshape or size by cutting strips of glass of a thickness corresponding\r\nto the depth desired, cementing these to a glass slide somewhat larger\r\nthan the ordinary one, and cementing over the frame so formed a piece\r\nof thin glass, No. 3; the best material to use as cement being marine\r\nglue of the best quality, or, failing this, Prout’s elastic glue, which\r\nis much cheaper, but also less satisfactory. The glass surface must\r\nbe made, in either case, sufficiently hot to ensure thorough adhesion\r\nof the cement, as the use of any solvent entails long waiting, and\r\nconsiderable risk of poisoning the organisms. A useful practical hint\r\nin the use of these troughs is that the corners, at the top, should be\r\ngreased slightly, otherwise the water finds its way out by capillary\r\nattraction, to the detriment of the stage of the microscope.\r\n\r\nOf optical accessories, the bull’s-eye is almost the most valuable. So\r\nmuch may be effected by its means alone, in practised hands, that it is\r\nwell worth the while of the beginner to master its use thoroughly, and\r\nthe methods of doing so will be explained in the succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\nThe substage condenser, too, even in its most simple form, is an\r\ninvaluable adjunct, even though it be only a hemisphere of glass,\r\nhalf an inch or so in diameter, mounted in a rough sliding jacket to\r\nfit underneath the stage. Such an instrument, properly fitted, will\r\ncost about fifteen shillings, but the ingenious worker will easily\r\nextemporise one for himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\nMany plants and animals require to be dissected to a certain extent\r\nbefore the details of their structure can be made out, and for this\r\npurpose the naked eye alone will rarely serve. The ordinary pocket\r\nmagnifier, however, if mounted as described in a preceding chapter,\r\nwill greatly facilitate matters, and the light may be focused upon the\r\nobject by means of the bull’s-eye condenser, as shown in Fig. 11. In\r\nthe figure the latter is represented as used in conjunction with the\r\nlamp, but daylight is preferable if it be available, the strain upon\r\nthe eyes being very much less than with artificial light. Two blocks\r\nof wood, about four inches high, will form convenient rests for the\r\nhands, a plate of glass being placed upon the blocks to support the\r\ndish, and a mirror being put in the interspace at an angle of 45° or\r\nso if required. A piece of black paper may be laid upon the mirror if\r\nreflected light alone is to be used.\r\n\r\nAs all delicate structures are dissected under fluid, a shallow dish\r\nis required. For this purpose nothing is better than one of the dishes\r\nused for developing photographic negatives. The bottom of the dish is\r\noccupied by a flat cork, to which a piece of flat lead is attached\r\nbelow, and the object having been pinned on to the cork in the required\r\nposition, the fluid is carefully run in. This fluid will naturally vary\r\naccording to the results desired to be obtained, but it must not be\r\nplain water, which so alters all cellular structures as to practically\r\nmake them unrecognisable under the microscope. Nothing could be better\r\nthan a 5 per cent. solution of formalin, were it not for the somewhat\r\nirritating odour of this fluid, since it at once fixes the cells and\r\npreserves the figure. For many purposes a solution of salt, in the\r\nproportion of a saltspoonful of the latter to a pint of water, will\r\nanswer well for short dissections. For more prolonged ones, a mixture\r\nof spirit-and-water, one part of the former to two of the latter,\r\nanswers well, especially for vegetable structures. When the dilution\r\nis first made, the fluid becomes milky, unless pure spirit be used,\r\nbut with a little trouble the Revenue authorities may be induced to\r\ngive permission for the use of pure methylated spirit, which answers\r\nevery purpose. The trouble then is that not less than five gallons can\r\nbe purchased, an _embarras de richesses_ for the average microscopist,\r\nbut, after all, the spirit is extremely cheap, and does not deteriorate\r\nby keeping.\r\n\r\nWhen the dissection in either of these media is completed, spirit\r\nshould be gradually added to bring the strength up to 50 per cent., in\r\nwhich the preparation may remain for a day or two, after which it is\r\ngradually brought into pure spirit, or into water again, according to\r\nthe medium in which it is to be mounted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nAs to the tools required, they are neither numerous nor expensive.\r\nFine-pointed but strong forceps (Fig. 9, _c_), curved and straight;\r\na couple of pairs of scissors, one strong and straight, the other\r\nmore delicate, and having curved blades, and a few needles of various\r\nthicknesses and curves, are the chief ones. The latter may be made by\r\ninserting ordinary needles, for three-fourths of their length, into\r\nsticks of straight-grained deal (ordinary firewood answers best), and\r\nthereafter bending them as required. A better plan, however, is to be\r\nprovided with a few of the needle-holders shown in Fig. 9, _b_. These\r\nare very simple and inexpensive, and in them broken needles are readily\r\nreplaced by others. Dipping-tubes, such as are shown in Fig. 12, will\r\nalso be extremely useful for many purposes. These are very easily made\r\nby heating the centre of a piece of soft glass tubing of the required\r\nsize, and, when it is quite red-hot, drawing the ends apart. The fine\r\ntube in the centre should now be divided by scratching it with a fine\r\ntriangular file, and the scratch may of course be made at such a\r\npoint as to afford a tube of the required fineness. The edges should\r\nbe smoothed by holding them in the flame until they just run (not\r\nmelt, or the tube will close). These tubes can often be made to supply\r\nthe place of a glass syringe. They may be used either for sucking up\r\nfluid or for transferring it, placing the finger over the wide end,\r\nallowing the tube to fill by displacement of air, and then re-closing\r\nit with the finger. This last method is especially useful for\r\ntransferring small objects from one receptacle to another. In speaking\r\nof the dissection of objects, it should have been mentioned that the\r\nmicroscope itself may, under careful handling, be made to serve very\r\nwell, only, as the image is reversed, it is almost impossible to work\r\nwithout using a prism to re-erect the image. Such a prism is shown in\r\nFig. 13. The microscope is placed vertically, and the observer, looking\r\nstraight into the prism, sees all the parts of the image in their\r\nnatural positions. This appliance is extremely useful for the purpose\r\nof selecting small objects, and arranging them on slides in any desired\r\nmanner. A few words may be added as to the reproduction of the images\r\nof objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe beginner is strongly recommended to practise himself in this\r\nfrom the outset. Even a rough sketch is worth pages of description,\r\nespecially if the magnification used be appended; and even though\r\nthe worker may be devoid of artistic talent, he will find that with\r\npractice he will acquire a very considerable amount of facility in\r\ngiving truthful outlines at least of the objects which he views.\r\nVarious aids have been devised for the purpose of assisting in the\r\nprocess. The simplest and cheapest of these consists of a cork cut so\r\nas to fit round the eye-piece. Into the cork are stuck two pins, at an\r\nangle of 45° to the plane of the cork, and, the microscope being placed\r\nhorizontally, a thin cover-glass is placed upon the two pins, the light\r\nbeing arranged and the object focused after the microscope is inclined.\r\nOn looking vertically down upon the cover-glass, a bright spot of light\r\nwill be seen, and as the eye is brought down into close proximity with\r\nit the spot will expand and allow the observer to see the whole of the\r\nimage without looking into the microscope. If a sheet of paper be now\r\nplaced upon the table at the place occupied by the image so projected,\r\nthe whole of the details will be clearly seen, as will also the point\r\nof a pencil placed upon the paper in the centre of the field of view;\r\nand, after a little practice, it will be found easy to trace round the\r\nchief details of the object. Two points require attention. The first is\r\nthat if the light upon the paper be stronger than that in the apparent\r\nfield of the microscope, the image will not be well seen, or if the\r\npaper be too feebly lighted, it will be difficult to keep the point of\r\nthe pencil in view. The light from the microscope is thrown into the\r\neye, and the view of the image upon the paper is the effect of a mental\r\nact, the eye looking out in the direction from which the rays appear\r\nto come. The paper has therefore to be illuminated independently, and\r\nhalf the battle lies in the adjustment of the relative brightness of\r\nimage and paper. The second point is, that it is essential to fix one\r\nparticular point in the image as the starting-point of the drawing, and\r\nthis being first depicted, the image and drawing of this point must be\r\nkept always coincident, or the drawing will be distorted, since the\r\nsmallest movement of the eye alters the relations of the whole. The\r\nreflector must be placed at an angle of 45°, or the field will be oval\r\ninstead of circular. The simple form of apparatus just described has\r\none drawback, inasmuch as the reflection is double, the front and back\r\nof the cover-glass both acting as reflectors. The image from the latter\r\nbeing much the more feeble of the two, care in illumination will do\r\nmuch to eliminate this difficulty; but there are various other forms\r\nin which the defect in question is got rid of. The present writer has\r\nworked with all of them, from the simple neutral tint reflector of\r\nBeale to the elaborate and costly apparatus of Zeiss, and, upon the\r\nwhole, thinks that he prefers the cover-glass to them all.\r\n\r\nA very simple plan, not so mechanical as the last-named, consists in\r\nthe use of “drawing-squares,” which are delicate lines ruled upon a\r\npiece of thin glass, and dropped into the eye-piece so that the lines\r\nrest upon the diaphragm of the eye-piece, and therefore are in focus\r\nat the same time as the object. By the use of these, in combination\r\nwith paper similarly ruled, a diagram of any required size can be drawn\r\nwith very great facility. The squares, if compared with a micrometer,\r\nwill furnish an exact standard of magnitude for each object-glass\r\nemployed. The micrometer is a piece of thin glass upon which are ruled\r\nminute divisions of an inch or a millimeter. Suppose the micrometer to\r\nbe placed under the microscope when the squares are in the eye-piece,\r\nand it be found that each division corresponds with one square of\r\nthe latter, then, if the micrometric division be one one-hundredth\r\nof an inch, and the squares upon the paper measure one inch, it is\r\nclear that the drawing will represent the object magnified a hundred\r\n“diameters”; if two divisions of the micrometer correspond to three\r\nsquares, the amplification will be a hundred and fifty diameters; if\r\nthree divisions correspond to two squares, sixty-six diameters, and\r\nso on. If a draw-tube be used, it will be necessary to know the value\r\nof the squares at each inch of the length, if they are to be used for\r\nmeasuring magnification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  Examination of Objects--Principles of Illumination--Mirror\r\n  and its Action--Substage Condenser--Use of Bull’s-eye--Opaque\r\n  Objects--Photography of Microscopic Objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much depends upon a right method of employing the microscope, as\r\nregards both comfort and accuracy, that we propose to devote a little\r\nspace to the consideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nLet us first warn the intending observer against the use of powers\r\nhigher than are required to bring out the details of the object. Mere\r\nmagnification is of very little use: it increases the difficulties both\r\nof illumination and of manipulation, and, as already said, interferes\r\nwith that grasp of the object which it is most desirable to obtain.\r\nRather let the beginner lay himself out to get the very most he can out\r\nof his lowest powers, and he will find that, by so doing, he will be\r\nable far better to avail himself of the higher ones when their use is\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nThe essential means to this end is a mastery of the principles of\r\nillumination, which we now proceed to describe.\r\n\r\nWe suppose the microscope to be inclined at an angle of about 70° to\r\nthe horizontal, with a low-power objective attached to it, a one-inch\r\nby preference. Opposite to the microscope, and about a foot away from\r\nit, is a lamp with the edge of the flame presented to the microscope,\r\nthe concave mirror of which is so arranged as to receive the rays from\r\nthe flame and direct them up the tube of the microscope. Upon the stage\r\nis placed a piece of ground-glass, and the mirror-arm is now to be\r\nmoved up or down upon its support until the ground-glass receives the\r\nmaximum of illumination, which it will do when the lamp-flame is at one\r\nconjugate focus of the mirror and the ground-glass at the other. The\r\nfocus will not be an image of the flame, but a bar of light.\r\n\r\nIf an object be now placed upon the stage, instead of the ground-glass,\r\nand the objective focused upon it, it will, if the mirror be properly\r\nadjusted, be brilliantly illuminated.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that every concave mirror has a focus, and\r\nconverges the rays which fall upon it to this focus, behaving exactly\r\nlike a convex lens. The principal focus of a concave mirror is its\r\nradius of curvature, and this is not difficult to determine. Place side\r\nby side a deep cardboard box and the lamp, so that the concave mirror\r\nmay send the rays back, along a path only slightly inclined to that by\r\nwhich they reached it, to the bottom of the box. The lamp and box being\r\nequidistant from the mirror, it is evident that when the mirror forms\r\nan image of the former upon the latter equal to the flame in size, we\r\nhave the equivalent of the equal conjugate foci shown in Fig. 2. Now\r\nmove the box to the distance from the mirror which corresponds to the\r\ndistance of the stage of the microscope from the mirror when the latter\r\nis in position upon the microscope, and then move the lamp to or fro\r\nuntil the mirror casts a sharp image of the flame upon the bottom of\r\nthe box, which is not to be moved. The lamp distance so found will be\r\nthe correct one for working with the concave mirror. The writer is led\r\nto lay special stress upon this matter, from the fact that he almost\r\ninvariably finds that the mirror is arranged to be used for parallel\r\nrays, _i.e._ for daylight, and is therefore fixed far too close to the\r\nstage to be available for correct or advantageous working with the\r\nlamp, unless, indeed, the bull’s-eye condenser be used, as hereinafter\r\ndescribed, to parallelise the rays from the lamp.\r\n\r\nWork done with the concave mirror can, however, under the most\r\nfavourable conditions, only be looked upon as a _pis aller_. The\r\nadvantages gained by the use of some substage condenser, even the most\r\nsimple, in conjunction with the plane mirror, or even without any\r\nmirror at all, are so manifold that the beginner is strongly urged\r\nto provide himself with some form or other of it, and we now proceed\r\nto describe the way in which this should be used to produce the best\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the problem to its most simple elements, turn the mirror\r\naltogether out of the way, and place the microscope upon a block at\r\nsuch a height as shall be convenient for observation, and shall allow\r\nthe rays from the lamp, placed in a line with it on the table, to shine\r\ndirectly into the tube of the microscope. Ascertain that this is so\r\nby removing both objective and eye-piece and looking down the tube,\r\nwhen the flame should be seen in the centre, edgewise. Now replace\r\nthe eye-piece, and screw on to the tube the one-inch combination or\r\nobjective. Place upon the stage an object, preferably a round diatom or\r\nan echinus-spine, and focus it as sharply as possible. Now place the\r\nsubstage condenser in its jacket, and slide it up and down until the\r\nimage of the object is bisected by the image of the flame.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the object will now be brilliantly illuminated by rays\r\ntravelling in the proper direction for yielding the best results.\r\nThe object is situated at the common focus of the microscope and the\r\ncondenser, and, whatever means of illumination be adopted, this is the\r\nresult which should always be aimed at.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory as this critical arrangement is, however, from a\r\nscientific point of view, it has its drawbacks from an artistic and\r\næsthetic one. It is not pleasant, for most purposes, to have merely the\r\ncentre of an object lighted up, and we have now to consider how the\r\nimage of the edge of the flame may be so expanded as to fill the field\r\nwithout sacrificing more than a very small fraction of the accuracy of\r\nthe arrangement just attained.\r\n\r\nReferring to Fig. 1, we see that if we place the lamp at the principal\r\nfocus of a lens, it will emit a bundle of parallel rays equal in\r\ndiameter to the diameter of the lens. This is the key of the position.\r\nWe cannot place the lamp at an infinite distance from the substage\r\ncondenser, but we can supply the latter with rays approximately\r\nparallel, so that it shall bring them to a focus upon the object\r\nat very nearly its own principal focus. This we do by means of the\r\nbull’s-eye condenser. Place the latter, with its flat side toward the\r\nedge of the flame, and at its principal focal distance (the method of\r\ndetermining which has already been described) from the latter, so that\r\nthe bundle of parallel rays which issue from it may pass up to the\r\nsubstage condenser. On examining the object again, it will be found\r\nthat, after slight adjustments of the position of the bull’s-eye have\r\nbeen made, the object lies in the centre of an evenly and brilliantly\r\nlighted field.\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to place the bull’s-eye a little farther from or\r\nnearer to the lamp, or to move it a little to one side or the other,\r\nbut when it is at the correct distance, and on the central line between\r\nthe lamp and the substage condenser, at right angles to this line,\r\nthe effects will be as described. It may help in securing this result\r\nif we mention that when the bull’s-eye is too far from the lamp, the\r\nimage of the flame is a spindle-shaped one; whilst, when the distance\r\nbetween the two is too short, _i.e._ less than the principal focal\r\nlength of the lens, the field is crossed by a bar or light, the ends of\r\nwhich are joined by a ring, whilst on either side of the bar there is a\r\nsemi-circular dark space.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto supposed the objects viewed to be transparent, but\r\nthere are many, of great interest, which are opaque, and call for other\r\nmeans of illumination. Of these there are several. The simplest and, in\r\nmany ways, the best is to use the bull’s-eye condenser to bring to a\r\nfocus upon the object the rays of light from some source placed above\r\nthe stage of the microscope. If light can be obtained from the sun\r\nitself, no lens will be needed to concentrate it; and indeed, if this\r\nwere done, there would be considerable risk of burning the object. The\r\nlight from a white cloud, however, with the help of the bull’s-eye,\r\nanswers admirably. At night-time an artificial source of light, the\r\nmore intense and the more distant the better, is required. For most\r\ncases, and with powers not higher than one inch, a good paraffin lamp,\r\nplaced about two feet away from the stage, and on one side of it, so as\r\nto be about a foot above the level of the object, will give all that is\r\nneeded. Such a lamp is shown in Fig. 14. Low magnifications are, as a\r\nrule, all that is called for in this method.\r\n\r\nLieberkuhn’s condensers are useful aids, but are somewhat expensive.\r\nThey are concave mirrors, which are so adjusted to the objective that\r\nthe latter and the reflector come into focus together, the light being\r\nsent in from below, or from one side.\r\n\r\nOne other method of illumination must be mentioned before leaving the\r\ntopic, and this is the illumination of objects upon a “dark field.”\r\nWith suitable subjects, and when carefully managed, there is no method\r\nwhich gives more beautiful effects, and it has the great advantage of\r\nallowing the object to be brilliantly lighted, without the strain to\r\nthe eyes which is involved in such lighting by the usual method of\r\ndirect illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nIt consists essentially in allowing the light to fall upon the object\r\nfrom below, at such an angle that none of it can enter the objective\r\ndirectly. Thus the concave mirror, turned as far as possible to one\r\nside, and reflecting on to the object the rays from the lamp placed\r\nupon the opposite side, will give very fair results with low powers;\r\nthis plan, however, is capable of but very limited application. Again,\r\na disc of black paper may be stuck on to the middle of the bull’s-eye,\r\nand the latter be placed below the stage between it and the mirror. In\r\nthis case everything depends upon the size of the disc, which, if too\r\nsmall, will not give a black ground, and if too large will cut off all\r\nlight from the object.\r\n\r\nThe best and only really satisfactory plan is to arrange the\r\nillumination with the substage condenser, as previously described, and\r\nthen to place below the lens of the latter a central stop of a suitable\r\nsize, which can only be determined by trial. When this has been done\r\nthe object will be seen brilliantly illuminated upon a field of velvety\r\nblackness. Such stops are supplied with the condenser.\r\n\r\nWe have devoted a considerable portion of space to this question, since\r\nit is, of all others, the most important to a successful, satisfactory,\r\nand reliable manipulation of the microscope; but even now, only the\r\nmain points of the subject have been touched upon, and the worker\r\nwill find it necessary to supplement the information given by actual\r\nexperiment. A few failures, rightly considered, will afford a great\r\namount of information, but those who desire to go thoroughly into the\r\nmatter are recommended to consult the present writer’s _Guide to the\r\nScience of Photomicrography_, where it is treated at much greater\r\nlength, as an essential part of the subject-matter of the book.\r\n\r\nIt may be added here, that no method of reproducing the images of\r\nobjects is on the whole so satisfactory as the photographic one; and\r\nwhilst a lengthened reference to the topic would be out of place in\r\na work of the character of the present one, the one just mentioned\r\nwill be found to contain all that is necessary to enable the beginner\r\nto produce results which, for faithfulness and beauty, far excel any\r\ndrawing, whilst they have the additional advantage that they can, if\r\nrequired, be exhibited to hundreds simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  Vegetable Cells and their Structure--Stellate Tissues--Secondary\r\n  Deposit--Ducts and Vessels--Wood-Cells--Stomata, or Mouths of\r\n  Plants--The Camera Lucida, and Mode of Using--Spiral and Ringed\r\n  Vessels--Hairs of Plants--Resins, Scents, and Oils--Bark Cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now suppose the young observer to have obtained a microscope\r\nand learned the use of its various parts, and will proceed to work\r\nwith it. As with one or two exceptions, which are only given for the\r\npurpose of further illustrating some curious structure, the whole\r\nof the objects figured in this work can be obtained without any\r\ndifficulty, the best plan will be for the reader to procure the plants,\r\ninsects, etc., from which the objects are taken, and follow the book\r\nwith the microscope at hand. It is by far the best mode of obtaining a\r\nsystematic knowledge of the matter, as the quantity of objects which\r\ncan be placed under a microscope is so vast that, without some guide,\r\nthe tyro flounders hopelessly in the sea of unknown mysteries, and\r\noften becomes so bewildered that he gives up the study in despair of\r\never gaining any true knowledge of it. I would therefore recommend the\r\nreader to work out the subjects which are here mentioned, and then\r\nto launch out for himself on the voyage of discovery. I speak from\r\nexperience, having myself known the difficulties under which a young\r\nand inexperienced observer has to labour in so wide a field, without\r\nany guide to help him to set about his work in a systematic manner.\r\n\r\nThe objects that can be most easily obtained are those of a vegetable\r\nnature, as even in London there is not a square, an old wall, a\r\ngreenhouse, a florist’s window, or even a greengrocer’s shop, that will\r\nnot afford an exhaustless supply of microscopic employment. Even the\r\nhumble vegetables that make their daily appearance on the dinner-table\r\nare highly interesting; and in a crumb of potato, a morsel of greens,\r\nor a fragment of carrot, the enthusiastic observer will find occupation\r\nfor many hours.\r\n\r\nFollowing the best examples, we will commence at the beginning, and see\r\nhow the vegetable structure is built up of tiny particles, technically\r\ncalled “cells.”\r\n\r\nThat the various portions of every vegetable should be referred to\r\nthe simple cell is a matter of some surprise to one who has had no\r\nopportunity of examining the vegetable structure, and indeed it does\r\nseem more than remarkable that the tough, coarse bark, the hard\r\nwood, the soft pith, the green leaves, the delicate flowers, the\r\nalmost invisible hairs, and the pulpy fruit, should all start from\r\nthe same point, and owe their origin to the simple vegetable cell.\r\nThis, however, is the case; and by means of a few objects chosen from\r\ndifferent portions of the vegetable kingdom, we shall obtain some\r\ndefinite idea of this curious phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Any one wishing to examine\r\nthese cells for himself may readily do so by cutting a very thin slice\r\nfrom the fruit, putting it on a slide, covering it with a piece of thin\r\nglass (which may be cheaply bought at the optician’s, together with the\r\nglass slides on which the objects are laid), and placing it under a\r\npower of two hundred diameters. Should the slice be rather too thick,\r\nit may be placed in the live-box and well squeezed, when the cells will\r\nexhibit their forms very distinctly. In their primary form the cells\r\nseem to be spherical; but as in many cases they are pressed together,\r\nand in others are formed simply by the process of subdivision, the\r\nspherical form is not very often seen. The strawberry, being a soft and\r\npulpy fruit, permits the cells to assume a tolerably regular form, and\r\nthey consequently are more or less globular.\r\n\r\nWhere the cells are of nearly equal size, and are subjected to equal\r\npressure in every direction, they force each other into twelve-sided\r\nfigures, having the appearance under the microscope of flat six-sided\r\nforms. Fig. 8, in the same Plate, taken from the stem of a lily, is\r\na good example of this form of cell, and many others may be found in\r\nvarious familiar objects.\r\n\r\nWe must here pause for a moment to define a cell before we proceed\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nThe cell is a close sac or bag formed of a substance called from its\r\nfunction “cellulose,” and containing certain semi-fluid contents as\r\nlong as it retains its life. In the interior of the cell may generally\r\nbe found a little dark spot, termed the “núcleus,” and which may be\r\nseen in Fig. 1, to which we have already referred. The object of the\r\nnucleus is rather a bone of contention among the learned, but the best\r\nauthorities on this subject consider it to be the vital centre of the\r\ncells, to and from which tends the circulation of the protoplasm, and\r\nwhich is intimately connected with the growth and reproduction of the\r\ncell. On looking a little more closely at the nucleus, we shall find it\r\nmarked with several small light spots, which are termed “nucléoli.”\r\n\r\nOn the same Plate (Fig. 2) is a pretty group of cells taken from the\r\ninternal layer of the buttercup leaf, and chosen because they exhibit\r\nthe series of tiny and brilliant green dots to which the colour of the\r\nleaf is due. The technical name for this substance is “chlorophyll,”\r\nor “leaf-green,” and it may always be found thus dotted in the leaves\r\nof different plants, the dots being very variable in size, number, and\r\narrangement. A very fine object for the exhibition of this point is the\r\nleaf of _Anácharis_, the “Canadian timber-weed,” to be found in almost\r\nevery brook and river. It also shows admirably the circulation of the\r\nprotoplasm in the cell.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the same Plate (Fig. 12) is a group of cells from\r\nthe pith of the elder-tree. This specimen is notable for the number\r\nof little “pits” which may be seen scattered across the walls of the\r\ncells, and which resemble holes when placed under the microscope.\r\nIn order to test the truth of this appearance, the specimen was\r\ncoloured blue by the action of iodine and dilute sulphuric acid, when\r\nit was found that the blue tint spread over the pits as well as the\r\ncell-walls, showing that the membrane is continuous over the pits.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 exhibits another form of cell, taken from the Spargánium, or\r\nbur-reed. These cells are tolerably equal in size, and have assumed a\r\nsquare shape. They are obtained from the lower part of the leaf. The\r\nreader who has any knowledge of entomology will not fail to observe the\r\nsimilarity in form between the six-sided and square cells of plants and\r\nthe hexagonal and square facets of the compound eyes of insects and\r\ncrustaceans. In a future page these will be separately described.\r\n\r\nSometimes the cells take most singular and unexpected shapes, several\r\nexamples of which will be briefly noticed.\r\n\r\nIn certain loosely made tissues, such as are found in the rushes and\r\nsimilar plants, the walls of the cells grow very irregularly, so\r\nthat they push out a number of arms which meet each other in every\r\ndirection, and assume the peculiar form which is termed “stellate,”\r\nor star-shaped tissue. Fig. 3 shows a specimen of stellate tissue\r\ntaken from the seed-coat of the privet, and rather deeply coloured,\r\nexhibiting clearly the beautiful manner in which the arms of the\r\nvarious stars meet each other. A smaller group of stellate cells taken\r\nfrom the stem of a large rush, and exemplifying the peculiarities of\r\nthe structure, are seen in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThe reader will at once see that this mode of formation leaves a vast\r\nnumber of interstices, and gives great strength with little expenditure\r\nof material. In water-plants, such as the reeds, this property is\r\nextremely valuable, as they must be greatly lighter than the water in\r\nwhich they live, and at the same time must be endowed with considerable\r\nstrength in order to resist its pressure.\r\n\r\nA less marked example of stellate tissue is given in Fig. 11, where\r\nthe cells are extremely irregular, in their form, and do not coalesce\r\nthroughout. This specimen is taken from the pithy part of a bulrush.\r\nThere are very many other plants from which the stellate cells may be\r\nobtained, among which the orange affords very good examples, in the\r\nso-called “white” that lies under the yellow rind, a section of which\r\nmay be made with a very sharp razor, and placed in the field of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nLooking toward the bottom of the Plate, and referring to Fig. 27, the\r\nreader will observe a series of nine elongated cells, placed end to\r\nend, and dotted profusely with chlorophyll. These are obtained from\r\nthe stalk of the common chickweed. Another example of the elongated\r\ncell is seen in Fig. 14, which is a magnified representation of the\r\nrootlets of wheat. Here the cells will be seen set end to end, and each\r\ncontaining its nucleus. On the left hand of the rootlet (Fig. 13) is a\r\ngroup of cells taken from the lowest part of the stem of a wheat plant\r\nwhich had been watered with a solution of carmine, and had taken up a\r\nconsiderable amount of the colouring substance. Many experiments on\r\nthis subject were made by the Rev. Lord S. G. Osborne, and may be seen\r\nat full length in the pages of the _Microscopical Journal_, the subject\r\nbeing too large to receive proper treatment in the very limited space\r\nwhich can here be given to it. It must be added that later researches\r\nhave caused the results here described to be gravely disputed.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 on the same Plate exhibits two notable peculiarities--the\r\nirregularity of the cells and the copiously pitted deposit with which\r\nthey are covered. The irregularity of the cells is mostly produced by\r\nthe way in which the multiplication takes place, namely, by division\r\nof the original cell into two or more new ones, so that each of these\r\ntakes the shape which it assumed when a component part of the parent\r\ncell. In this case the cells are necessarily very irregular, and when\r\nthey are compressed from all sides they form solid figures of many\r\nsides, which, when cut through, present a flat surface marked with a\r\nvariety of irregular outlines. This specimen is taken from the rind of\r\na gourd.\r\n\r\nThe “pitted” structure which is so well shown in this figure is caused\r\nby a layer of matter which is deposited in the cell and thickens its\r\nwalls, and which is perforated with a number of very minute holes\r\ncalled “pits.” This substance is called “secondary deposit.” That these\r\npits do not extend through the real cell-wall has already been shown\r\nin Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nThis secondary deposit assumes various forms. In some cases it is\r\ndeposited in rings round the cell, and is clearly placed there for\r\nthe purpose of strengthening the general structure. Such an example\r\nmay be found in the mistletoe (Fig. 5), where the secondary deposit\r\nhas formed itself into clear and bold rings that evidently give\r\nconsiderable strength to the delicate walls which they support. Fig. 10\r\nshows another good instance of similar structure; differing from the\r\npreceding specimen in being much longer and containing a greater number\r\nof rings. This object is taken from an anther of the narcissus. Among\r\nthe many plants from which similar objects may be obtained, the yew is\r\nperhaps one of the most prolific, as ringed wood-cells are abundant\r\nin its formation, and probably aid greatly in giving to the wood the\r\nstrength and elasticity which have long made it so valuable in the\r\nmanufacture of bows.\r\n\r\nBefore taking leave of the cells and their remarkable forms, we will\r\njust notice one example which has been drawn in Fig. 6. This is a\r\ncongeries of cells, containing their nuclei, starting originally end to\r\nend, but swelling and dividing at the top. This is a very young group\r\nof cells (a young hair, in fact) from the inner part of a lilac bud,\r\nand is here introduced for the purpose of showing the great similarity\r\nof all vegetable cells in their earliest stages of existence.\r\n\r\nHaving now examined the principal forms of cells, we arrive at the\r\n“vessels,” a term which is applied to those long and delicate tubes\r\nwhich are formed of a number of cells set end to end, their walls of\r\nseparation being absorbed.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 19 the reader will find a curious example of the “pitted\r\nvessel,” so called from the multitude of little markings which cover\r\nits walls, and are arranged in a spiral order. Like the pits and rings\r\nalready mentioned, the dots are composed of secondary deposit in the\r\ninterior of the tube, and vary very greatly in number, function, and\r\ndimensions. This example is taken from the wood of the willow, and is\r\nremarkable for the extreme closeness with which the dots are packed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the right hand of the preceding figure may be seen\r\nanother example of a dotted vessel (Fig. 20), taken from a wheat stem.\r\nIn this instance the cells are not nearly so long, but are wider than\r\nin the preceding example, and are marked in much the same way with a\r\nspiral series of dots. About the middle of the topmost cell is shown\r\nthe short branch by which it communicates with the neighbouring vessel.\r\n\r\nFig. 23 exhibits a vessel taken from the common carrot, in which the\r\nsecondary deposit is placed in such a manner as to resemble a net of\r\nirregular meshes wrapped tightly round the vessel. For this reason\r\nit is termed a “netted vessel.” A very curious instance of these\r\nstructures is given in Fig. 26, at the bottom of the Plate, where\r\nare represented two small vessels from the wood of the elm. One of\r\nthem--that on the left hand--is wholly marked with spiral deposit,\r\nthe turns being complete; while, in the other instance, the spiral is\r\ncomparatively imperfect, and the cell-walls are marked with pits. If\r\nthe reader would like to examine these structures more attentively, he\r\nwill find plenty of them in many familiar garden vegetables, such as\r\nthe common radish, which is very prolific in these interesting portions\r\nof vegetable nature.\r\n\r\nThere is another remarkable form in which this secondary deposit is\r\nsometimes arranged that is well worthy of our notice. An example\r\nof this structure is given in Fig. 18, taken from the stalk of the\r\ncommon fern or brake. It is also found in very great perfection in the\r\nvine. On inspecting the illustration, the reader will observe that\r\nthe deposit is arranged in successive bars or steps, like those of a\r\nwinding staircase. In allusion to the ladder-like appearance of this\r\nformation, it is called “scalariform” (Latin, _scala_, a ladder).\r\n\r\nIn the wood of the yew, to which allusion has already been made, there\r\nis a very peculiar structure, a series of pits found only in those\r\ntrees that bear cones, and therefore termed the coniferous pitted\r\nstructure. Fig. 16 is a section of a common cedar pencil, the wood,\r\nhowever, not being that of the true cedar, but of a species of fragrant\r\nJuniper. This specimen shows the peculiar formation which has just been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nAny piece of deal or pine will exhibit the same peculiarities in a\r\nvery marked manner, as is seen in Fig. 24. A specimen may be readily\r\nobtained by making a very thin shaving with a sharp plane. In this\r\nexample the deposit has taken a partially spiral form, and the numerous\r\ncircular pits with which it is marked are only in single rows. In\r\nseveral other specimens of coniferous woods, such as the Araucaria, or\r\nNorfolk Island pine, there are two or three rows of pits.\r\n\r\nA peculiarly elegant example of this spiral deposit may be seen in the\r\nwood of the common yew (Fig. 17). If an exceedingly thin section of\r\nthis wood be made, the very remarkable appearance will be shown which\r\nis exhibited in the illustration. The deposit has not only assumed the\r\nperfectly spiral form, but there are two complete spirals, arranged\r\nat some little distance from each other, and producing a very pretty\r\neffect when seen through a good lens.\r\n\r\nThe pointed, elongated shape of the wood-cells is very well shown\r\nin the common elder-tree (see Fig. 15). In this instance the cells\r\nare without markings, but in general they are dotted like Fig. 21,\r\nan example cut from the woody part of the chrysanthemum stalk. This\r\naffords a very good instance of the wood-cell, as its length is\r\nconsiderable, and both ends are perfect in shape. On the right hand\r\nof the figure is a drawing of the wood-cell found in the lime-tree\r\n(Fig. 22), remarkable for the extremely delicate spiral markings with\r\nwhich it is adorned. In these wood-cells the secondary deposit is so\r\nplentiful that the original membranous character of the cell-walls\r\nis entirely lost, and they become elongated and nearly solid cases,\r\nhaving but a very small cavity in their centre. It is to this deposit\r\nthat the hardness of wood is owing, and the reader will easily see\r\nthe reason why the old wood is so much harder than the young and new\r\nshoots. In order to permit the passage of the fluids which maintain\r\nthe life of the part, it is needful that the cell-wall be left thin\r\nand permeable in certain places, and this object is attained either\r\nby the “pits” described on page <a href=\\\"#Page_43\">43</a>, or by the\r\nintervals between the spiral deposit.\r\n\r\nAt the right-hand bottom corner of Plate I. (Fig. 28) may be seen\r\na prettily marked object, which is of some interest. It is a slice\r\nstripped from the outer coat of the holly-berry, and is given for the\r\npurpose of illustrating the method by which plants are enabled to\r\nbreathe the atmospheric air on which they depend as much as ourselves,\r\nthough their respiration is slower. Among the mass of net-like cells\r\nmay be seen three curious objects, bearing a rather close resemblance\r\nto split kidneys. These are the mouths, or “stómata,” as they are\r\nscientifically called.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the mouths may be seen a dark spot, which is the\r\naperture through which the air communicates with the passages between\r\nthe cells in the interior of the structure. In the flowering plants\r\ntheir shape is generally rounded, though they sometimes take a squared\r\nform, and they regularly occur at the meeting of several surface\r\ncells. The two kidney-shaped cells which form the “mouth” are the\r\n“guard-cells,” so called from their function, since, by their change of\r\nform, they cause the mouth to open or shut, according to the needs of\r\nthe plant. In young plants these guard-cells are very little below the\r\nsurface of the leaf or skin, but in others they are sunk quite beneath\r\nthe layer of cells forming the outer coat of the tissue. There are\r\nother cases where they are slightly elevated above the surface.\r\n\r\nStomata are found chiefly in the green portions of plants, and are\r\nmost plentiful on the under side of leaves. It is, however, worthy of\r\nnotice, that when an aquatic leaf floats on the water, the mouths are\r\nonly to be found on the upper surface. These curious and interesting\r\nobjects are to be seen in many structures where we should hardly think\r\nof looking for them; for instance, they may be found existing on the\r\ndelicate skin which envelops the kernel of the common walnut. As might\r\nbe expected, their dimensions vary with the character of the leaf on\r\nwhich they exist, being large upon the soft and pulpy leaves, and\r\nsmaller upon those of a hard and leathery consistence. The reader will\r\nfind ample amusement, and will gain great practical knowledge of the\r\nsubject, by taking a plant, say a tuft of groundsel, and stripping off\r\nportions of the external skin or “epidermis” from the leaf or stem,\r\netc., so as to note the different sizes and shapes of the stomata.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite bottom corner of Plate I. Fig. 25, is an example of\r\na stoma taken from the outer skin of a gourd, and here given for the\r\npurpose of showing the curious manner in which the cells are arranged\r\nabout the mouth, no less than seven cells being placed round the\r\nsingle mouth, and the others arranged in a partially circular form\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nTurning to Plate II., we find several other examples of stomata, the\r\nfirst of which (Fig. 1) is obtained from the under surface of the\r\nbuttercup leaf, by stripping off the external skin, or “epidermis,” as\r\nit is scientifically termed. The reader will here notice the slightly\r\nwaved outlines of the cell-walls, together with the abundant spots\r\nof chlorophyll with which the leaf is coloured. In this example the\r\nstomata appear open. Their closure or expansion depends chiefly on the\r\nstate of the weather; and, as a general rule, they are open by day and\r\nclosed at night.\r\n\r\nA remarkably pretty example of stomata and elongated cells is to be\r\nobtained from the leaf of the common iris, and may be prepared for the\r\nmicroscope by simply tearing off a strip of the epidermis from the\r\nunder side of the leaf, laying it on a slide, putting a little water on\r\nit, and covering it with a piece of thin glass. (See Plate II. Fig. 2.)\r\nThere are a number of longitudinal bands running along the leaf where\r\nthese cells and stomata appear. The latter are not placed at regular\r\nintervals, for it often happens that the whole field of the microscope\r\nwill be filled with cells without a single stoma, whilst elsewhere a\r\ngroup of three or four may be seen clustered closely together.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 on the same Plate exhibits a specimen of the beautifully waved\r\ncells, without mouths, which are found on the upper surface of the ivy\r\nleaf. These are difficult to arrange from the fresh leaf, but are\r\neasily shown by steeping the leaf in water for some time, and then\r\ntearing away the cuticle. The same process may be adopted with many\r\nleaves and cuticles, and in some cases the immersion must be continued\r\nfor many days, and the process of decomposition aided by a very little\r\nnitric acid in the water, or by boiling.\r\n\r\nOn the same Plate are three examples of spiral and ringed vessels,\r\ntypes of an endless variety of these beautiful and interesting\r\nstructures. Fig. 4 is a specimen of a spiral vessel taken from the\r\nlily, and is a beautiful example of a double spire. The deposit which\r\nforms this spiral is very strong, and it is to the vast number of\r\nthese vessels that the stalk owes its well-known elasticity. In many\r\ncases the spiral vessels are sufficiently strong to be visible to the\r\nnaked eye, and to bear uncoiling. For example, if a leaf-stalk of\r\ngeranium be broken across, and the two fragments gently drawn asunder,\r\na great number of threads, drawn from the spiral vessels, will be seen\r\nconnecting the broken ends. In this case the delicate membranous walls\r\nof the vessel are torn apart, and the stronger fibre which is coiled\r\nspirally within it unrolls itself in proportion to the force employed.\r\nIn many cases these fibres are so strong that they will sustain the\r\nweight of an inch or so of the stalk.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 5 is seen a still more bold and complex form of this curious\r\nstructure; being a coil of five threads, laid closely against each\r\nother, and forming, while remaining in their natural position, an\r\nalmost continuous tube. This specimen is taken from the root of the\r\nwater lily, and requires some little care to exhibit its structure\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nEvery student of nature must be greatly struck with the analogies\r\nbetween different portions of the visible creation. These spiral\r\nstructures which we have just examined are almost identical in\r\nappearance, and to some extent in their function, with the threads that\r\nare coiled within the breathing tubes of insects. This is in both cases\r\ntwofold, namely, to give support and elasticity to a delicate membrane,\r\nand to preserve the tube in its proper form, despite the bending to\r\nwhich it may be subjected. When we come to the anatomy of the insect in\r\na future page we shall see this structure further exemplified.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the deposit, instead of forming a spiral coil, is\r\narranged in a series of rings, and the vessel is then termed\r\n“annulated.” A very good example of this formation is given in Fig. 6,\r\nwhich is a sketch of such a vessel, taken from a stalk of the common\r\nrhubarb. To see these ringed vessels properly, the simplest plan is to\r\nboil the rhubarb until it is quite soft, then to break down the pulpy\r\nmass until it is flattened, to take some of the most promising portions\r\nwith the forceps, lay them on the slide and press them down with a thin\r\nglass cover. They will not be found scattered at random through the\r\nfibres, which elsewhere present only a congeries of elongated cells,\r\nbut are seen grouped together in bundles, and with a little trouble may\r\nbe well isolated, and the pulpy mass worked away so as to show them\r\nin their full beauty. As may be seen in the illustration, the number\r\nof the rings and their arrangement is extremely variable. A better,\r\nbut somewhat more troublesome, plan is to cut longitudinal sections of\r\nthe stem, as described in our concluding chapter, when not only the\r\nvarious forms of cells and vessels, but their relations to each other,\r\nwill be well shown. The numerous crystals of oxalate of lime, which\r\nmake rhubarb so injurious a food for certain persons, will also be well\r\nseen. These crystals are called “raphides,” and are to be found in very\r\nmany plants in different forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1. Cuticle, Buttercup leaf\r\n   2.   Do. Iris\r\n   3.   Do.

They are all appendages of and arise from the skin\r\nor epidermis; and although their simplest form is that of a projecting\r\nand elongated cell, the variety of shapes which are assumed by these\r\norgans is inexhaustible. On Plate II. are examples of some of the more\r\nstriking forms, which will be briefly described.\r\n\r\nThe simple hair is well shown in Figs. 18, 19, and 32, the first being\r\nfrom the flower of the heartsease, the second from a dock-leaf, and the\r\nthird from a cabbage. In Fig. 18 the hair is seen to be but a single\r\nprojecting cell, consisting only of a wall and the contents. In Fig. 19\r\nthe hair has become more decided in shape, having assumed a somewhat\r\ndome-like form; and in Fig. 32 it has become considerably elongated,\r\nand may at once be recognised as a true hair.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 8 is a curious example of a hair taken from the white Arabis,\r\none of the cruciferous flowers, which is remarkable for the manner\r\nin which it divides into two branches, each spreading in opposite\r\ndirections. Another example of a forked hair is seen in Fig. 13, but in\r\nthis instance the hair is composed of a chain of cells, the three lower\r\nforming the stem of the hair, and the two upper being lengthened into\r\nthe lateral branches. This hair is taken from the common southernwood.\r\n\r\nIn most cases of long hairs, the peculiar elongation is formed by a\r\nchain of cells, varying greatly in length and development. Several\r\nexamples of these hairs will be seen on the same Plate.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 is a beaded hair from the Marvel of Peru, which is composed of\r\na number of separate cells placed end to end, and connected by slender\r\nthreads in a manner that strongly reminds the observer of a chain of\r\nbeads strung loosely together, so as to show the thread by which they\r\nare connected with each other. Another good example is seen at Fig. 11,\r\nin a hair taken from the leaf of the sowthistle. In this case the\r\nbeads are strung closely together, and when placed under a rather high\r\npower of the microscope have a beautifully white and pearly aspect.\r\nThe leaf must be dry and quite fresh, and the hairs seen against the\r\ngreen of the leaf. Fig. 39 represents another beaded hair taken from\r\nthe Virginian Spiderwort, or Tradescantia. This hair is found upon the\r\nstamens, and is remarkable for the beautifully beaded outline, the\r\nfine colouring, and the spiral markings with which each cell is adorned.\r\n\r\nA still further modification of these many-celled hairs is found in\r\nseveral plants, where the hairs are formed by a row of ordinarily\r\nshaped cells, with the exception of the topmost cell, which is suddenly\r\nelongated into a whip-like form. Fig. 22 represents a hair of this\r\nkind, taken from the common groundsel; and Fig. 36 is a still more\r\ncurious instance, found upon the leaf of the thistle. The reader may\r\nhave noticed the peculiar white “fluffy” appearance of the thistle leaf\r\nwhen it is wet after a shower of rain. This appearance is produced\r\nby the long lash-like ends of the hairs, which are bent down by the\r\nweight of the moisture, and lie almost at right angles with the thicker\r\nportions of the hair.\r\n\r\nAn interesting form of hair is seen in the “sting” of the common\r\nnettle. This may readily be examined by holding a leaf edgewise in the\r\nstage forceps, and laying it under the field of the microscope. In\r\norder to get the proper focus throughout the hair, the finger should\r\nbe kept upon the screw movement, and the hair brought gradually into\r\nfocus from its top to its base. The general structure of this hair is\r\nnot unlike that which characterises the fang of a venomous serpent. The\r\nacrid fluid which causes the pain is situated in the enlarged base of\r\nthe hair, and is forced through the long straight tubular extremity by\r\nmeans of the pressure exerted when the sting enters the skin. At the\r\nvery extremity of the perfect sting is a slight bulb-like swelling,\r\nwhich serves to confine the acrid juice, and which is broken off on the\r\nleast pressure. The sting is seen in Fig. 43.\r\n\r\nThe extremities of many hairs present very curious forms, some being\r\nlong and slender, as in the examples already mentioned, while others\r\nare tipped with knobs, bulbs, clubs, or rosettes in endless variety.\r\n\r\nFig. 12 is a hair of the tobacco leaf, exhibiting the two-celled gland\r\nat the tip, containing the peculiar principle of the plant, known by\r\nthe name of “nicotine.” The reader will see how easy it is to detect\r\nadulteration of tobacco by means of the microscope. The leaves most\r\ngenerally used for this purpose are the dock and the cabbage, so that\r\nif a very little portion of leaf be examined the character of the hairs\r\nwill at once inform the observer whether he is looking at the real\r\narticle or its substitute.\r\n\r\nFig. 15 is a hair from the flower of the common yellow snapdragon,\r\nwhich is remarkable for the peculiar shape of the enlarged extremity,\r\nand for the spiral markings with which it is decorated. Fig. 16 is a\r\ncurious little knobbed hair found upon the moneywort, and Fig. 17 is an\r\nexample of a double-knobbed hair taken from the Geum. Fig. 34 affords\r\na very curious instance of a glandular hair, the stem being built up\r\nof cells disposed in a very peculiar fashion, and the extremity being\r\ndeveloped into a beautiful rosette-shaped head. This hair came from\r\nthe Garden Verbena.\r\n\r\nCuriously branched hairs are not at all uncommon, and some very good\r\nand easily obtained examples are given on Plate II.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 is one of the multitude of branched hairs that surround the\r\nwell-known fruit of the plane-tree, the branches being formed by some\r\nof the cells pointing outward. These hairs do not assume precisely the\r\nsame shape; for Fig. 29 exhibits another hair from the same locality,\r\non which the spikes are differently arranged, and Fig. 30 is a sketch\r\nof another such hair, where the branches have become so numerous and so\r\nwell developed that they are quite as conspicuous as the parent stem.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and interesting forms of hair is that which\r\nis found upon the lavender leaf, and which gives it the peculiar\r\nbloom-like appearance on the surface.\r\n\r\nThis hair is represented in Figs. 40 and 41. On Fig. 40 the hair is\r\nshown as it appears when looking directly upon the leaf, and in Fig. 41\r\na section of the leaf is given, showing the mode in which the hairs\r\ngrow into an upright stem, and then throw out horizontal branches in\r\nevery direction. Between the two upright hairs, and sheltered under\r\ntheir branches, may be seen a glandular appendage not unlike that which\r\nis shown in Fig. 16. This is the reservoir containing the perfume, and\r\nit is evidently placed under the spreading branches for the benefit\r\nof their shelter. On looking upon the leaf by reflected light the\r\nhairs are beautifully shown, extending their arms on all sides; and\r\nthe globular perfume cells may be seen scattered plentifully about,\r\ngleaming like pearls through the hair-branches under which they repose.\r\nThey will be found more numerous on the under side of the leaf.\r\n\r\nThis object will serve to answer a question which the reader has\r\nprobably put to himself ere this, namely, Where are the fragrant\r\nresins, scents, and oils stored? On Plate I. Fig. 16, will be seen the\r\nreply to the first question; Fig. 41 of the present Plate has answered\r\nthe second question, and Fig. 42 will answer the third. This figure\r\nrepresents a section of the rind of an orange, the flattened cells\r\nabove constituting the delicate yellow skin, and the great spherical\r\nobject in the centre being the reservoir in which the fragrant\r\nessential oil is stored. The covering is so delicate that it is easily\r\nbroken, so that even by handling an orange some of the scent is sure\r\nto come off on the hands, and when the peel is stripped off and bent\r\ndouble, the reservoirs burst in myriads, and fling their contents to\r\na wonderful distance. This may be easily seen by squeezing a piece of\r\norange peel opposite a lighted candle, and noting the distance over\r\nwhich the oil will pass before reaching the flame, and bursting into\r\nlittle flashes of light. Other examples are given on the same plate.\r\n\r\nReturning to the barbed hairs, we may see in Fig. 35 a highly magnified\r\nview of the “pappus” hair of a dandelion, _i.e._ the hairs which\r\nfringe the arms of the parachute-like appendage which is attached\r\nto the seed. The whole apparatus will be seen more fully on Plate\r\nIII. Figs. 44, 45, 46. This hair is composed of a double layer of\r\nelongated cells lying closely against each other, and having the ends\r\nof each cell jutting out from the original line. A simpler form of\r\na double-celled, or more properly a “duplex” hair, will be seen in\r\nFig. 44. This is one of the hairs from the flower of the marigold and\r\nhas none of the projecting ends to the cells.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the cell-walls of the hairs become greatly hardened\r\nby secondary deposit, and the hairs are then known as spines. Two\r\nexamples of these are seen in Figs. 37 and 38, the former being picked\r\nfrom the Indian fig-cactus, and well known to those persons who have\r\nbeen foolish enough to handle the fig roughly before feeling it. The\r\nwounds which these spines will inflict are said to be very painful,\r\nand have been compared to those produced by the sting of the wasp.\r\nThe latter hair is taken from the Opuntia. These spines must not be\r\nconfounded with thorns; which latter are modified branches.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 represents the extreme tip of a hair from the hollyhock leaf,\r\nsubjected to a lens of very high power.\r\n\r\nMany hairs assume a star-like appearance, an aspect which may be\r\nproduced in different ways. Sometimes a number of simple hairs start\r\nfrom the same base, and by radiating in different directions produce\r\nthe stellate effect. An example of this kind of hair may be seen in\r\nFig. 14, which is a group of hairs from the hollyhock leaf. There is\r\nanother mode of producing the star-shape which may be seen in Fig. 45,\r\na hair taken from the leaf of the ivy. Very fine examples may also be\r\nfound upon the leaf of Deutzia scabra.\r\n\r\nHairs are often covered with curious little branches or protuberances,\r\nand present many other peculiarities of form which throw a considerable\r\nlight upon certain problems in scientific microscopy.\r\n\r\nFig. 33 represents a hair of two cells taken from the flower of the\r\nwell-known dead-nettle, which is remarkable for the number of knobs\r\nscattered over its surface. A similar mode of marking is seen in\r\nFig. 31, a club-shaped hair covered with external projections, found\r\nin the flower of the Lobelia. In order to exhibit these markings well,\r\na power of two hundred diameters is needed. Fig. 21 shows this dotting\r\nin another hair from the dead-nettle, where the cell is drawn out to a\r\ngreat length, but is still covered with these markings.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 is an example of a very curious hair taken from the throat of\r\nthe pansy. This hair may readily be obtained by pulling out one of the\r\npetals, when the hairs will be seen at its base. Under the microscope\r\nit has a particularly beautiful appearance, looking just like a glass\r\nwalking-stick covered with knobs, not unlike those huge, knobby\r\nclub-like sticks in which some farmers delight, where the projections\r\nhave been formed by the pressure of a honeysuckle or other climbing\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nA hair of a similar character, but even more curious, is found in the\r\nsame part of the flower of the Garden Verbena (see Fig. 27), and is not\r\nonly beautifully translucent, but is coloured according to the tint of\r\nthe flower from which it is taken. Its whole length is covered with\r\nlarge projections, the joints much resembling the antennæ of certain\r\ninsects; and each projection is profusely spotted with little dots,\r\nformed by elevation of the outer skin or cuticle. These are of some\r\nvalue in determining the structure of certain appearances upon petals\r\nand other portions of the flowers, and may be compared with Figs. 33 to\r\n35 on Plate III.\r\n\r\nFig. 26 offers an example of the square cells which usually form the\r\nbark of trees. This is a transverse section of cork, and perfectly\r\nexhibits the form of bark cells. The reader is very strongly advised\r\nto cut a delicate section of the bark of various trees, a matter very\r\neasily accomplished with the aid of a sharp razor and a steady hand.\r\n\r\nFig. 24 is a transverse section through one of the scales of a\r\npine-cone, and is here given for the purpose of showing the numerous\r\nresin-filled cells which it displays. This may be compared with Fig. 16\r\nof Plate I. Fig. 25 is a part of one of the “vittæ,” or oil reservoirs,\r\nfrom the fruit of the caraway, showing the cells containing the\r\nglobules of caraway oil. This is rather a curious object, because the\r\nspecimen from which it was taken was boiled in nitric acid, and yet\r\nretained some of the oil globules. Immediately above it may be seen\r\n(Fig. 23) a transverse section of the beechnut, showing a cell with\r\nits layers of secondary deposit.\r\n\r\nIn the cuticle of the grasses and the mare’s-tails is deposited a large\r\namount of pure flint. So plentiful is this substance, and so equally\r\nis it distributed, that it can be separated by heat or acids from the\r\nvegetable parts of the plant, and will still preserve the form of the\r\noriginal cuticle, with its cell-walls, stomata, and hairs perfectly\r\nwell defined.\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate II., represents a piece of wheat chaff, or “bran,” that\r\nhas been kept at a white heat for some time, and then mounted in\r\nCanada balsam. I prepared the specimen from which the drawing was made\r\nby laying the chaff on a piece of platinum, and holding it over the\r\nspirit-lamp. A good example of the silex or flint in wheat is often\r\ngiven by the remains of a straw fire, where the stems may be seen still\r\nretaining their tubular form but fused together into a hard glassy\r\nmass. It is this substance that cuts the fingers of those who handle\r\nthe wild grasses too roughly, the edges of the blades being serrated\r\nwith flinty teeth, just like the obsidian swords of the ancient\r\nMexicans, or the shark’s-tooth falchion of the New Zealander.\r\n\r\nThese are but short and meagre accounts of a very few objects, but\r\nspace will not permit of further elucidation, and the purpose of this\r\nlittle work is not to exhaust the subjects of which it treats, but to\r\nincite the reader to undertake investigation on his own account, and to\r\nmake his task easier than if he had done it unaided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n  Starch, its Growth and Properties--Surface Cells of Petals--Pollen\r\n  and its Functions--Seeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe white substance so dear to the laundries under the name of starch\r\nis found in a vast variety of plants, being distributed more widely\r\nthan most of the products which are found in the interior of vegetable\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nThe starch grains are of very variable size even in the same plant,\r\nand their form is as variable as their size, though there is a general\r\nresemblance in those of the same plant which allows of their being\r\nfairly easily identified after a moderate amount of practice. Sometimes\r\nthe grains are found loosely packed in the interior of the cells, and\r\nare then easily recognised as starch grains by their peculiar form\r\nand the delicate lines with which they are marked; but in many places\r\nthey are pressed so closely together that they assume an hexagonal\r\nshape under the microscope, and bear a close resemblance to ordinary\r\ntwelve-sided cells. In other plants, again, the grains never advance\r\nbeyond the very minute form in which they seem to commence their\r\nexistence; and in some, such as the common oat, a great number of very\r\nlittle granules are compacted together so as to resemble one large\r\ngrain.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of detecting starch in those cases where\r\nits presence is doubtful; and the two modes that are usually employed\r\nare polarised light and the iodide of potassium. When polarised\r\nlight is employed--a subject on which we shall have something to say\r\npresently--the starch grains assume the characteristic “black-cross,”\r\nand when a plate of selenite is placed immediately beneath the slide\r\ncontaining the starch grains, they glow with all the colours of the\r\nrainbow. The second plan is to treat them with a very weak solution\r\nof iodine and iodide of potassium, and in this case the iodine has\r\nthe effect on the starch granules of staining them blue. They are so\r\nsusceptible of this reaction that when the liquid is too strong the\r\ngrains actually become black from the amount of iodine which they\r\nimbibe.\r\n\r\nNothing is easier than to procure starch granules in the highest\r\nperfection. Take a raw potato, and with a razor cut a very thin\r\nslice from its interior, the direction of the cut not being of the\r\nslightest importance. Put this delicate slice upon a slide, drop a\r\nlittle water upon it, cover it with a piece of thin glass, give it a\r\ngood squeeze, and place it under a power of a hundred or a hundred and\r\nfifty diameters. Any part of the slice, provided that it be very thin,\r\nwill then present the appearance shown in Plate III. Fig. 9, where an\r\nordinary cell of potato is seen filled loosely with starch grains of\r\ndifferent sizes. Around the edges of the slice a vast number of starch\r\ngranules will be seen, which have been squeezed out of their cells by\r\npressure, and are now floating freely in the water. As cold water has\r\nno perceptible effect upon starch, the grains are not altered in form\r\nby the moisture, and can be examined at leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

All the lines evidently refer to the little\r\ndark spots at the end of the granule, called technically the “hilum,”\r\nand represent the limits of successive layers of material deposited\r\none after another. The lines in question are very much better seen if\r\nthe substage condenser be used with a small central stop, so as to\r\nobtain partial dark-field illumination. Otherwise they are often very\r\ndifficult of detection.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest stages of their growth the starch granules appear to be\r\ndestitute of these markings, or at all events they are so few and so\r\ndelicate as not to be visible even with the most perfect instruments,\r\nand it is not until the granules assume a comparatively large size that\r\nthe external markings become distinctly perceptible.\r\n\r\nWe will now glance at the examples of starch which are given in the\r\nPlate, and which are a very few out of the many that might be figured.\r\nFig. 2 represents the starch of wheat, the upper grain being seen in\r\nfront, the one immediately below it in profile, and the two others\r\nbeing examples of smaller grains. Fig. 6 is a specimen of a very minute\r\nform of starch, where the granules do not seem to advance beyond\r\ntheir earliest stage. This specimen is obtained from the parsnip; and\r\nalthough the magnifying power is very great, the dimensions of the\r\ngranules are exceedingly small, and except by a very practised eye they\r\nwould not be recognisable as starch grains.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is a good example of a starch grain of wheat, exemplifying the\r\nchange that takes place by the combined effects of heat and moisture.\r\nIt has already been observed that cold water exercises little, if\r\nany, perceptible influence upon starch; but it will be seen from\r\nthe illustration that hot water has a very powerful effect. When\r\nsubjected to the action of water at a temperature over 140° Fahr.,\r\nthe granule swells rapidly, and at last bursts, the contents escaping\r\nin a gelatinous mass, and the external membrane collapsing into the\r\nform which is shown in Fig. 3, which was taken out of a piece of hot\r\npudding. A similar form of wheat starch may also be detected in bread,\r\naccompanied, unfortunately, by several other substances not generally\r\npresumed to be component parts of the “staff of life.”\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 7 are represented some grains of starch from West Indian\r\narrowroot, and Fig. 8 exhibits the largest kind of starch grain known,\r\nobtained from the tuber of a species of canna, supposed to be _C.\r\nedúlis_, a plant similar in characteristics to the arrowroot. The\r\npopular name of this starch is “Tous les Mois,” and under that title\r\nit may be obtained from the opticians, or chemists.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 shows the starch granules from Indian corn, as they appear\r\nbefore they are compressed into the honeycomb-like structure which\r\nhas already been mentioned. Even in that state, however, if they are\r\ntreated with iodine, they exhibit the characteristics of starch in a\r\nvery perfect manner. Fig. 11 is starch from sago, and Fig. 12 from\r\ntapioca, and in both these instances the several grains have been\r\ninjured by the heat employed in preparing the respective substances for\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 exhibits the granules obtained from the root of the water-lily,\r\nand Fig. 14 is a good example of the manner in which the starch\r\ngranules of rice are pressed together so as to alter the shape and\r\npuzzle a novice. Fig. 16 is the compound granule of the oat, which\r\nhas already been mentioned, together with some of the simple granules\r\nseparated from the mass; and Fig. 15 is an example of the starch grains\r\nobtained from the underground stem of the horse-bean. It is worthy of\r\nmention that the close adhesion of the rice starch into those masses is\r\nthe cause of the peculiar grittiness which distinguishes rice flour to\r\nthe touch.\r\n\r\nWhilst very easily acted on by heat, starch-granules are very resistent\r\nto certain other reagents. Weak alkalies, in watery solution, readily\r\nattack them, but by treating portions of plants with caustic potash\r\ndissolved in strong spirit, the woody and other parts may be dissolved\r\naway; and after repeated washing with spirit the starch may be mounted.\r\nThis, however, must never be in any glycerine medium, except that given\r\non p. <a href=\\\"#Page_172\">172</a>.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Plate III. Fig. 1, may be seen a curious little drawing, which is\r\na sketch of the laurel-leaf cut transversely, and showing the entire\r\nthickness of the leaf. Along the top may be seen the delicate layer\r\nof “varnish” with which the surface of the leaf is covered, and which\r\nserves to give to the foliage its peculiar polish. This varnish is\r\nnothing more than the translucent matter which binds all the cells\r\ntogether, and which is poured out very liberally upon the surface of\r\nthe leaf. The lower part of this section exhibits the cells of which\r\nthe leaf is built, and towards the left hand may be seen a cut end of\r\none of the veins of the leaf, more rightly called a wood-cell.\r\n\r\nWe will now examine a few examples of surface cells.\r\n\r\nFig. 5 is a portion of epidermis stripped from a Capsicum pod,\r\nexhibiting the remains of the nuclei in the centre of each cell,\r\ntogether with the great thickening of the wall-cells and the numerous\r\npores for the transmission of fluid. This is a very pretty specimen for\r\nthe microscope, as it retains its bright red colour, and even in old\r\nand dried pods exhibits the characteristic markings.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the Plate may be seen a wheel-like arrangement of\r\nthe peculiar cells found on the petals of six different flowers, all\r\neasily obtainable, and mounted without difficulty.\r\n\r\nFig. 30 is the petal of a geranium (Pelargonium), a very common object\r\non purchased slides. It is a most lovely subject for the microscope,\r\nwhether it be examined with a low or a high power,--in the former\r\ninstance exhibiting a most beautiful “stippling” of pink, white, and\r\nblack, and in the latter showing the six-sided cells with their curious\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of each cell is seen a radiating arrangement of dark\r\nlines with a light spot in the middle, looking very like the mountains\r\non a map. These lines were long thought to be hairs; but Mr. Tuffen\r\nWest, in an interesting and elaborate paper on the subject, has shown\r\ntheir true nature. From his observations it seems that the beautiful\r\nvelvety aspect of flower petals is owing to these arrangements of the\r\nsurface cells, and that their rich brilliancy of colour is due to the\r\nsame cause. The centre of each cell-wall is elevated as if pushed up by\r\na pointed instrument from the under side of the wall, and in different\r\nflowers this elevation assumes different forms. Sometimes it is merely\r\na slight wart on the surface, sometimes it becomes a dome, while in\r\nother instances it is so developed as to resemble a hair. Indeed,\r\nMr. West has concluded that these elevations are nothing more than\r\nrudimentary hairs.\r\n\r\nThe dark radiating lines are shown by the same authority to be formed\r\nby wrinkling of the membrane forming the walls of the elevated centre,\r\nand not to be composed of “secondary deposit,” as has generally been\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nFig. 31 represents the petal of the common periwinkle, differing from\r\nthat of the geranium by the straight sides of the cell-walls, which do\r\nnot present the toothed appearance so conspicuous in the former flower.\r\nA number of little tooth-like projections may be seen on the interior\r\nof the cells, their bases affixed to the walls and their points tending\r\ntoward the centre, and these teeth are, according to Mr. West, formed\r\nof secondary deposit.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 32 is shown the petal of the common garden balsam, where the\r\ncells are elegantly waved on their outlines, and have plain walls.\r\nThe petal of the primrose is seen in Fig. 34, and that of the yellow\r\nsnapdragon in Fig. 33; in the latter instance the surface cells assume\r\na most remarkable shape, running out into a variety of zigzag outlines\r\nthat quite bewilders the eye when the object is first placed under the\r\nmicroscope. Fig. 35 is the petal of the common scarlet geranium.\r\n\r\nIn several instances these petals are too thick to be examined without\r\nsome preparation, and glycerine will be found well adapted for that\r\npurpose. The young microscopist must, however, beware of forming his\r\nideas from preparations of dried leaves, petals, or hairs, and should\r\nalways procure them in their fresh state whenever he desires to make\r\nout their structure. Even a fading petal should not be used, and if the\r\nflowers are gathered for the occasion, their stalks should be placed\r\nin water, so as to give a series of leaves and petals as fresh as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now pass from the petal of the flower to the pollen, that coloured\r\ndust, generally yellow or white, which is found upon the stamens, and\r\nwhich is very plentiful in many flowers, such as the lily and the\r\nhollyhock.\r\n\r\nThis substance is found only upon the stamens or anthers of full-blown\r\nflowers (the anthers being the male organs), and is intended for the\r\npurpose of enabling the female portion of the flower to produce fertile\r\nseeds. In form the pollen grains are wonderfully diverse, affording\r\nan endless variety of beautiful shapes. In some cases the exterior is\r\nsmooth and marked only with minute dots, but in many instances the\r\nouter wall of the pollen grain is covered with spikes, or decorated\r\nwith stripes or belts. A few examples of the commonest forms of pollen\r\nwill be found on Plate III.\r\n\r\nFig. 17 is the pollen of the snowdrop, which, as will be seen, is\r\ncovered with dots and marked with a definite slit along its length.\r\nThe dots are simply tubercles in the outer coat of the grain, and\r\nare presumed to be formed for the purpose of strengthening the\r\nmembrane, otherwise too delicate, upon the same principle which gives\r\nto “corrugated” iron such strength in proportion to the amount of\r\nmaterial. Fig. 18 is the pollen of the wall-flower, shown in two views,\r\nand having many of the same characteristics as that of the snowdrop.\r\nFig. 19 is the pollen of the willow-herb, and is here given as an\r\nillustration of the manner in which the pollen aids in the germination\r\nof plants.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand its action, we must first examine its structure.\r\n\r\nAll pollen-grains are furnished with some means by which their contents\r\nwhen thoroughly ripened can be expelled. In some cases this end is\r\naccomplished by sundry little holes called pores; in others, certain\r\ntiny lids are pushed up by the contained matter; and in some, as in\r\nthe present instance, the walls are thinned in certain places so as to\r\nyield to the internal pressure.\r\n\r\nWhen a ripe pollen-grain falls upon the stigma of a flower, it\r\nimmediately begins to swell, and seems to “sprout” like a potato in\r\na damp cellar, sending out a slender “pollen-tube” from one or other\r\nof the apertures already mentioned. In Fig. 19 a pollen-tube is seen\r\nissuing from one of the projections, and illustrates the process better\r\nthan can be achieved by mere verbal description. The pollen-tubes\r\ninsinuate themselves between the cells of the stigmas, and, continually\r\nelongating, worm their way down the “style” until they come in contact\r\nwith the “ovules.” By very careful dissection of a fertilised stigma,\r\nthe beautiful sight of the pollen-tubes winding along the tissues of\r\nthe style may be observed under a high power of the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe pollen-tube is nothing more than the interior coat of the grain,\r\nvery much developed, and filled with a substance technically named\r\n“fovilla,” composed of “protoplasm” (the semi-liquid substance which\r\nis found in the interior of cells), very minute starch grains, and some\r\napparently oily globules.\r\n\r\nIn order to examine the structure of the pollen-grains properly, they\r\nshould be examined under various circumstances--some dry, others placed\r\nin water to which a little sugar has been added, others in oil, and it\r\nwill often be found useful to try the effect of different acids upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 is the pollen of the common violet, and is easily recognisable\r\nby its peculiar shape and markings. Fig. 21 is the pollen of the\r\nmusk-plant, and is notable for the curious mode in which its surface\r\nis belted with wide and deep bands, running spirally round the\r\ncircumference. Fig. 22 exhibits the pollen of the apple, and Fig. 23\r\naffords a very curious example of the raised markings upon the surface\r\nof the dandelion pollen. In Fig. 24 there are also some very wonderful\r\nmarkings, but they are disposed after a different fashion, forming a\r\nsort of network upon the surface, and leaving several large free spaces\r\nbetween the meshes. The pollen of the lily is shown in Fig. 25, and is\r\na good example of a pollen-grain covered with the minute dottings which\r\nhave already been described.\r\n\r\nFigs. 26 and 27 show two varieties of compound pollen, found in two\r\nspecies of heath. These compound pollen-grains are not of unfrequent\r\noccurrence, and are accounted for in the following manner.\r\n\r\nThe pollen is formed in certain cavities within the anthers, by means\r\nof the continual subdivision of the “parent-cells” from which it is\r\ndeveloped. In many cases the form of the grain is clearly owing to the\r\ndirection in which these cells have divided, but there is no great\r\ncertainty on this subject. It will be seen, therefore, that if the\r\nprocess of subdivision be suddenly arrested, the grains will be found\r\nadhering to each other in groups of greater or smaller size, according\r\nto the character of the species and the amount of subdivision that has\r\ntaken place. The reader must, however, bear in mind that the whole\r\nsubject is as yet rather obscure, and that further discovery may throw\r\ndoubt on many theories which at present are accepted as established.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 shows the pollen of the furze, in which are seen the\r\nlongitudinal slits and the numerous dots on the surface; and Fig. 29\r\nis the curiously shaped pollen of the tulip. The two large yellow\r\nglobular figures at each side of the Plate represent the pollen of\r\ntwo common flowers; Fig. 36 being that of the crocus, and Fig. 37 a\r\npollen-grain of the hollyhock. As may be seen from the illustration,\r\nthe latter is of considerable size, and is covered with very numerous\r\nprojections. These serve to raise the grain from a level surface, over\r\nwhich it rolls with a surprising ease of motion, so much so indeed\r\nthat if a little of this substance be placed on a slide and a piece\r\nof thin glass laid over it, the glass slips off as soon as it is in\r\nthe least inclined, and forces the observer to fix it with paper or\r\ncement before he can place it on the inclined stage of the microscope.\r\nThe little projections have a very curious effect under a high\r\npower, and require careful focusing to observe them properly; for the\r\ndiameter of the grain is so large that the focus must be altered to\r\nsuit each individual projection. Their office is, probably, to aid in\r\nfertilisation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seeds of plants are even easier of examination than the pollen, and\r\nin most cases require nothing but a pocket lens and a needle for making\r\nout their general structure. The smaller seeds, however, must be placed\r\nunder the microscope, many of them exhibiting very curious forms. The\r\nexternal coat of seeds is often of great interest, and needs to be\r\ndissected off before it can be rightly examined. The simplest plan in\r\nsuch a case is to boil the seed well, press it while still warm into\r\na plate of wax, and then dissect with a pair of needles, forceps, and\r\nscissors under water. Many seeds may also be mounted in cells as dry\r\nobjects, after being thoroughly dried themselves.\r\n\r\nA few examples of the seeds of common plants are given at the bottom of\r\nPlate III.\r\n\r\nFig. 38 exhibits the fruit, popularly called the seed, of the common\r\ngoosegrass, or Galium, which is remarkable for the array of hooklets\r\nwith which it is covered. Immediately above the figure may be seen a\r\ndrawing of one of the hooks much magnified, showing its sharp curve\r\n(Fig. 39). It is worthy of remark that the hook is not a simple curved\r\nhair, but a structure composed of a number of cells terminating in a\r\nhook.\r\n\r\nFig. 40 shows the seed, or rather the fruit, of the common red\r\nvalerian, and is introduced for the purpose of showing its plumed\r\nextremity, which acts as a parachute, and causes it to be carried\r\nabout by the wind until it meets with a proper resting-place. It is\r\nalso notable for the series of strong longitudinal ribs which support\r\nits external structure. On Fig. 41 is shown a portion of one of the\r\nparachute hairs much more magnified.\r\n\r\nThe seed of the common dandelion, so dear to children in their\r\nplay-hours, when they amuse themselves by puffing at the white\r\nplumy globes which tip the ripe dandelion flower-stalks, is a very\r\ninteresting object even to their parents, on account of its beautiful\r\nstructure, and the wonderful way in which it is adapted to the place\r\nwhich it fills. Fig. 45 represents the seed portion of one of these\r\nobjects, together with a part of the parachute stem, the remainder of\r\nthat appendage being shown lying across the broken stem.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the seed is not unlike that of the valerian, but it is\r\neasily distinguished from that object by the series of sharp spikes\r\nwhich fringe its upper end, and which serve to anchor the seed firmly\r\nas soon as it touches the ground. From this end of the seed proceeds\r\na long slender shaft, crowned at its summit by a radiating plume of\r\ndelicate hairs, each of which is plentifully jagged on its surface, as\r\nmay be seen in Fig. 46, which shows a small portion of one of these\r\nhairs greatly magnified. These jagged points are evidently intended to\r\nserve the same purpose as the spikes below, and to arrest the progress\r\nof the seed as soon as it has found a convenient spot.\r\n\r\nFig. 42 is the seed of the foxglove, and Fig. 43 the seed of the\r\nsunspurge, or milkwort. Fig. 47 shows the seed of the yellow\r\nsnapdragon; remarkable for the membranous wing with which the seed\r\nis surrounded, and which is composed of cells with partially spiral\r\nmarkings. When viewed edgewise, it looks something like Saturn with\r\nhis ring, or, to use a more homely but perhaps a more intelligible\r\nsimile, like a marble set in the middle of a penny. Fig. 48 is a seed\r\nof mullein, covered with net-like markings on its external surface.\r\nThese are probably to increase the strength of the external coat, and\r\nare generally found in the more minute seeds.\r\n\r\nOn Fig. 50 is shown a seed of the burr-reed; a structure which is\r\nremarkable for the extraordinary projection of the four outer ribs, and\r\ntheir powerful armature of reverted barbs. Fig. 51 shows another form\r\nof parachute seed, found in the willow-herb, where the parachute is\r\nnot expanded nearly so widely as that of the valerian; neither is it\r\nset upon a long slender stem like that of the dandelion, but proceeds\r\nat once from the top of the seed, widening towards the extremity,\r\nand having a very comet-like appearance. Two more seeds only remain,\r\nFig. 49 being the seed of Robin Hood, and the other, Fig. 52, that of\r\nthe muskmallow, being given in consequence of the thick coat of hairs\r\nwith which it is covered.\r\n\r\nMany seeds can be well examined when mounted in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n  Algæ and their Growth--Desmidiaceæ, where found--Diatoms, their\r\n  Flinty Deposit--Volvox--Mould, Blight, and Mildew--Mosses and\r\n  Ferns--Mare’s-Tail and the Spores--Common Sea-weeds and their Growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Plate IV. will be seen many examples of the curious vegetables\r\ncalled respectively algæ and fungi, which exhibit some of the lowest\r\nforms of vegetable life, and are remarkable for their almost universal\r\npresence in all parts of this globe, and also almost all conditions of\r\ncold, heat, or climate. Many of them are well known under the popular\r\nname of sea-weeds, others are equally familiar under the titles of\r\n“mould,” “blight,” or “mildew,” while many of the minuter kinds exhibit\r\nsuch capability of motion, and such apparent symptoms of volition, that\r\nthey have long been described as microscopic animalcules, and thought\r\nto belong to the animal rather than to the vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents one of the very lowest forms of vegetable life, being\r\nknown to the man of science as the Palmella, and to the general public\r\nas “gory dew.” It may be seen on almost any damp wall, extending in red\r\npatches of various sizes, looking just as if some blood had been dashed\r\non the wall, and allowed to dry there. With a tolerably powerful\r\nlens this substance can be resolved into the exceedingly minute cells\r\ndepicted in the figure. Generally, these cells are single, but in many\r\ninstances they are double, owing to the process of subdivision by which\r\nthe plant grows, if such a term may be used.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 affords an example of another very low form of vegetable, the\r\nPalmoglæa, that green slimy substance which is so common on damp\r\nstones. When placed under the microscope, this plant is resolvable\r\ninto a multitude of green cells, each being surrounded with a kind of\r\ngelatinous substance. The mode of growth of this plant is very simple.\r\nA line appears across one of the cells, and after a while it assumes a\r\nkind of hour-glass aspect, as if a string had been tied tightly round\r\nits middle. By degrees the cell fairly divides into two parts, and then\r\neach part becomes surrounded with its own layer of gelatine, so as to\r\nform two separate cells, placed end to end.\r\n\r\nOne of the figures, that on the right hand, represents the various\r\nprocesses of “conjugation,” _i.e._ the union and fusion together of two\r\ncells. Each cell throws out a little projection; these meet together,\r\nand then uniting, form a sort of isthmus connecting the two main\r\nbodies. This rapidly widens, until the two cells become fused into one\r\nlarge body. The whole subject of conjugation is very interesting, and\r\nis treated at great length in the _Micrographic Dictionary_ of Messrs.\r\nGriffith and Henfrey, a work to which the reader is referred for\r\nfurther information on many of the subjects that, in this small work,\r\ncan receive but a very hasty treatment.\r\n\r\nFew persons would suppose that the slug-like object on Fig. 3, the\r\nlittle rounded globules with a pair of hair-like appendages, and the\r\nround disc with a dark centre, are only different forms of the same\r\norganism. Such, however, is the case, and these are three of the\r\nmodifications which the Protococcus undergoes. This vegetable may be\r\nseen floating like green froth on the surface of rain-water.\r\n\r\nOn collecting some of this froth and putting it under the microscope,\r\nit is seen to consist of a vast number of little green bodies, moving\r\nbriskly about in all directions, and guiding their course with such\r\napparent exercise of volition that they might very readily be taken for\r\nanimals. It may be noticed that the colour of the plant is sometimes\r\nred, and in that state it has been called the Hæmatococcus.\r\n\r\nThe “still” state of this plant is shown in the round disc. After a\r\nwhile the interior substance splits into two portions; these again\r\nsubdivide, and the process is repeated until sixteen or thirty-two\r\ncells become developed out of the single parent-cell. These little ones\r\nthen escape, and, being furnished with two long “cilia” or thread-like\r\nappendages, whirl themselves merrily through the water. When they have\r\nspent some time in this state, growing all the while, they lose their\r\ncilia, become clothed with a strong envelope, and pass into the still\r\nstage from which they had previously emerged. This curious process is\r\nrepeated in endless succession, and causes a very rapid growth of the\r\nplant. The moving bodies are technically called zoospores, or living\r\nspores, and are found in many other plants besides those of the lowest\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Porphyra laciniata\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV.]\r\n\r\nOn Fig. 13 is delineated a very minute plant, called from its colour\r\nChlorococcus. It may be found upon tree-trunks, walls, etc., in the\r\nform of green dust, and has recently been found to take part in forming\r\nthe first stage of lichens.\r\n\r\nA large and interesting family of the “confervoid algæ,” as these low\r\nforms of vegetable life are termed, is the Desmidiaceæ, called in more\r\ncommon parlance desmids. A few examples of this family are given in\r\nPlate IV.\r\n\r\nThey may be found in water, always preferring the cleanest and the\r\nbrightest pools, mostly congregating in masses of green film at the\r\nbottom of the water, or investing the stems of plants. Their removal\r\nis not very easy, but is best accomplished by very carefully taking up\r\nthis green slippery substance in a spoon, and straining the water away\r\nthrough fine muslin. They may also be separated by allowing a ring,\r\ncovered with muslin, to float upon the surface of the water collected\r\nin a jar, for, being great lovers of light, they assemble where it\r\nis most abundant. An opaque jar should be used. For preservation,\r\nglycerine-gelatine seems to be the best fluid. A very full and accurate\r\ndescription of these plants may be found in Ralfs’ _British Desmidieæ_.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 represents one of the species of Closterium, more than twenty\r\nof which are known. These beautiful objects can be obtained from the\r\nbottom of almost every clear pool, and are of some interest on account\r\nof the circulating currents that may be seen within the living plants.\r\nA high power is required to see this phenomenon clearly. The Closteria\r\nare reproduced in various ways. Mostly they divide across the centre,\r\nbeing joined for a while by two half-cells. Sometimes they reproduce\r\nby means of conjugation, the process being almost entirely conducted\r\non the convex sides. Fig. 5 represents the end of a Closterium, much\r\nmagnified in order to show the actively moving bodies contained within\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFig. 16 is a supposed desmid, called Ankistrodesmus, and presumed to be\r\nan earlier stage of Closterium.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 is a very pretty desmid called the Pediastrum, and valuable to\r\nthe microscopist as exhibiting a curious mode of reproduction. The\r\nfigure shows a perfect plant composed of a number of cells arranged\r\nsystematically in a star-like shape; Fig. 15 is the same species\r\nwithout the colouring matter, in order to show the shape of the cells.\r\nThe Pediastrum reproduces by continual subdivision of the contents of\r\neach cell into a number of smaller cells, termed “gonidia” on account\r\nof their function on the perpetuation of the species. When a sufficient\r\nnumber has been formed, they burst through the envelope of the original\r\ncell, taking with them a portion of its internal layer, so as to form\r\na vesicle, in which they move actively. In a few minutes they arrange\r\nthemselves in a circle, and after a while they gradually assume the\r\nperfect form, the whole process occupying about two days. Fig. 18\r\nexhibits an example of the genus Desmidium. In this genus the cells are\r\neither square or triangular in their form, having two teeth at their\r\nangles, and twisted regularly throughout their length, causing the wavy\r\nor oblique lines which distinguish them. The plants of this genus are\r\ncommon, and may be found almost in any water. I may as well mention\r\nthat I have obtained nearly all the preceding species, together with\r\nmany others, from a little pond on Blackheath.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 is another desmid called Scenedesmus, in which the cells are\r\narranged in rows of from two to ten in number, the cell at each\r\nextremity being often furnished with a pair of bristle-like appendages.\r\nFig. 14 is another species of the same plant, and both may be found in\r\nthe water supplied for drinking in London, as well as in any pond.\r\n\r\nA common species of desmid is seen at Fig. 12, called Sphærozosma,\r\nlooking much like a row of stomata set chainwise together. It\r\nmultiplies by self-division.\r\n\r\nFig. 17 is a specimen of desmid named Cosmarium, plentifully found\r\nin ponds on heaths and commons, and having a very pretty appearance\r\nin the microscope, with its glittering green centre and beautifully\r\ntransparent envelope. The manner in which the Cosmarium conjugates is\r\nvery remarkable, and is shown at Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nThe two conjugating cells become very deeply cleft, and by degrees\r\nseparate, suffering the contents to pour out freely, and, as at present\r\nappears, without any envelope to protect them. The mass, however,\r\nsoon acquires an envelope of its own, and by degrees assumes a dark\r\nreddish-brown tint. It is now termed a sporangium, and is covered with\r\na vast number of projections, which in this genus are forked at their\r\ntip, but in others, which also form sporangia, are simply pointed. The\r\nClosteria conjugate after a somewhat similar manner, and it is not\r\nunfrequent to find a pair in this condition, but in their case the\r\nsporangium is quite smooth on its surface.\r\n\r\nAnother very remarkable family of confervoid algæ is that which is\r\nknown under the name of Oscillatoriæ, from the oscillating movement\r\nof the plant. They are always long and filamentous in character, and\r\nmay be seen moving up and down with a curious irregularity of motion.\r\nTheir growth is extremely rapid, and may be watched under a tolerably\r\npowerful lens, thus giving many valuable hints as to the mode by\r\nwhich these plants are reproduced. One of the commonest species is\r\nrepresented at Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nFigs. 9, 10, and 11 are examples of another family, called technically\r\nthe Zygnemaceæ, because they are so constantly yoked together by\r\nconjugation. They all consist of a series of cylindrical cells, set end\r\nto end, and having their green contents arranged in similar patterns.\r\nTwo of the most common and typical species are here given.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 is the Spirogyra, so called from the spiral arrangement of\r\nthe chlorophyll; and Fig. 10 is the Tyndaridea, or Zygnema, as it is\r\ncalled by some writers. A casual inspection will show how easy it is\r\nto distinguish the one from the other. Fig. 11 represents a portion of\r\nthe Tyndaridea during the process of conjugation, showing the tube of\r\nconnection between the cells and one of the spores.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the diatoms, so called because of their method of\r\nreproduction, in which it appears as if a cut were made right along the\r\noriginal cell. The commonest of these plants is the Diatóma vulgáre,\r\nseen in Fig. 21 as it appears while growing. The reproduction of this\r\nplant is effected by splitting down the centre, each half increasing\r\nto the full size of the original cell; and in almost every specimen of\r\nwater taken from a pond, examples of this diatom undergoing the process\r\nof division will be distinguished. It also grows by conjugation. The\r\ndiatoms are remarkable for the delicate shell or flinty matter which\r\nforms the cell skeleton, and which will retain its shape even after\r\nintense heat and the action of nitric acid. While the diatoms are\r\nalive, swimming through the water, their beautiful markings are clearly\r\ndistinct, glittering as if the form were spun from crystalline glass.\r\nJust above the figure, and to the right hand, are two outlines of\r\nsingle cells of this diatom, the one showing the front view and the\r\nother the profile.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 is an example of a diatom--Cocconéma lanceolátum--furnished\r\nwith a stalk. The left-hand branch sustains a “frustule” exhibiting the\r\nfront view, while the other is seen sideways.\r\n\r\nAnother common diatom is shown in Fig. 23, and is known by the name of\r\nSynedra. This constitutes a very large genus, containing about seventy\r\nknown species. In this genus the frustules are at first arranged upon\r\na sort of cushion, but in course of time they mostly break away from\r\ntheir attachment. In some species they radiate in every direction from\r\nthe cushion, like the spikes of the ancient cavalier’s mace.\r\n\r\nFig. 24 is another stalked diatom called Gomphonéma acuminátum, found\r\ncommonly in ponds and ditches. There are nearly forty species belonging\r\nto this genus. A pair of frustules are also shown which exhibit the\r\nbeautiful flinty outline without the coloured contents (technically\r\ncalled endochrome).\r\n\r\nFig. 27 is a side view of a beautiful diatom, called Eunótia diadéma\r\nfrom its diadem-like form. There are many species of this genus. When\r\nseen upon the upper surface, it looks at first sight like a mere row of\r\ncells with a band running along them; but by careful arrangement of the\r\nlight its true form may easily be made out.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 represents a very common fresh-water diatom, named Melosíra\r\nvárians. The plants of this genus look like a cylindrical rod composed\r\nof a variable number of segments, mostly cylindrical, but sometimes\r\ndisc-shaped or rounded. An end view of one of the frustules is seen\r\nat the left hand, still coloured with its dots of “endochrome,” and\r\nshowing the cylindrical shape. Immediately above is a figure of another\r\nfrustule seen under both aspects with the endochrome removed.\r\n\r\nA rather curious species of diatom, called Cocconeïs pedículus, is\r\nseen at Fig. 29 as it appears on the surface of common water-cress.\r\nSometimes the frustules, which in all cases are single, are crowded\r\nvery closely upon each other and almost wholly hide the substance on\r\nwhich they repose. Fig. 30 is another diatom of a flag-like shape,\r\nnamed Achnanthes, having a long slender filament attached to one end\r\nof the lower frustule, representing the flag-staff. There are many\r\nwonderful species of such diatoms, some running almost end to end like\r\na bundle of sticks, and therefore called Bacillária; others spreading\r\nout like a number of fans, such as the genus Licmophora; while some\r\nassume a beautiful wheel-like aspect, of which the genus Meridion\r\naffords an excellent example.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable, and not uncommon, fresh-water diatom is the\r\nBacillária paradóxa. It looks, when at rest, like a broad brown ribbon\r\nof varying length. The diatoms lie across the ribbon, on edge, and\r\nslide upon each other exactly like the ladders of a fire-escape, so\r\nthat the broad ribbon is converted into a fine long thread, which\r\nspeedily closes up again into the original ribbon, and so _da capo_.\r\nThe reason for this movement, and how it is effected, is absolutely\r\nunknown; indeed, nothing certain is known as to the way in which\r\ndiatoms move, nor has ever a probable guess yet been made.\r\n\r\nThe last of the diatoms which we shall be able to mention in this\r\nwork is that represented on Fig. 31. The members of this genus have\r\nthe name of Navícula, on account of their boat-like shape and their\r\nhabit of gliding through the water in a canoe-like fashion. There are\r\nmany species of this genus, all of which are notable for the graceful\r\nand varied courses formed by their outlines, and the extreme delicacy\r\nof their markings. In many species the markings are so extremely\r\nminute that they can only be made out with the highest powers of the\r\nmicroscope and the most careful illumination, so that they serve as\r\ntest objects whereby the performance of a microscope can be judged by a\r\npractical man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe large spherical figure in the centre of Plate IV. represents an\r\nexample of a family belonging to the confervoid algæ, and known by the\r\nname of Volvox globator. There seems to be but one species known.\r\n\r\nThis singular plant has been greatly bandied about between the\r\nvegetable and animal kingdoms, but seems now to be satisfactorily\r\nsettled among the vegetables. In the summer it may be found in pools\r\nof water, sufficiently large to be visible to the naked eye, like a\r\nlittle green speck proceeding slowly through the water. When a moderate\r\npower is used, it appears as shown in the figure, and always contains\r\nwithin its body a number of smaller individuals, which after a while\r\nburst through the envelope of the parent and start upon an independent\r\nexistence. On a closer examination, a further generation may be\r\ndiscovered even within the bodies of the children. The whole surface is\r\nprofusely covered with little green bodies, each being furnished with\r\na pair of movable cilia, by means of which the whole organism is moved\r\nthrough the water. These bodies are analogous to the zoospores already\r\nmentioned, and are connected with each other by a network of filaments.\r\nReproduction also takes place by conjugation as in other algæ. A\r\nmore magnified representation of one of the green bodies is shown\r\nimmediately above the larger figure. The volvox is apt to die soon when\r\nconfined in a bottle.\r\n\r\nFig. 25 is the common yeast-plant, consisting simply of a chain of\r\ncells, which increase by budding, and only form spores when they have\r\nexhausted the nutriment in the fluid in which they live. Fig. 26 is\r\na curious object, whose scientific name is Sárcina ventrículi. It is\r\nfound in the human stomach. Similar forms are often to be found in the\r\nair; for instance, a piece of cocoa-nut will exhibit this, and many\r\nother kinds of Bacteria and moulds, after a few days’ exposure to the\r\nair, preferably in a dark cupboard.\r\n\r\nWe now come upon a few of the blights and mildews. A very interesting\r\nseries of forms is first to be alluded to. Upon the bramble-leaf may\r\noften be found spots, at first red, then orange, then reddish black.\r\nThese are known as Œcidium berberidis. Fig. 32 shows the “red-rust”\r\nof wheat, the Urédo; and Fig. 33 is the mildew of corn, known as\r\nPuccinia. The interest lies in the fact that these three forms are\r\nsuccessive stages in the life-history of the same plant. Another\r\nspecies of Urédo, together with a Phragmídium, once thought to be\r\nanother kind of fungus, is seen on a rose-leaf on Plate V. Fig. 1.\r\nOn Fig. 10, however, of the same Plate, the Phragmídium may be seen\r\nproceeding from Urédo, thus proving them to be but two states of the\r\nsame plant. There is room for any amount of observation and work in\r\nconnection with the life-histories of many of these fungi.\r\n\r\nAnother species of Puccinia, found on the thistle, is shown on Plate\r\nV. Fig. 7. Fig. 34 is the mould found upon decaying grapes, and called\r\ntherefrom, or from the clustered spores, Botrýtis. Some of the detached\r\nspores are seen by its side. Fig. 35 is another species of the same\r\ngenus, termed Botrýtis parasítica, and is the cause of the well-known\r\n“potato-disease.”\r\n\r\nThe mosses and ferns afford an endless variety of interesting objects\r\nto the microscopist; but as their numbers are so vast, and the details\r\nof their structure so elaborate, they can only be casually noticed in\r\nthe present work. Fig. 38 represents a spore-case of the Polypodium,\r\none of the ferns, as it appears while in the act of bursting and\r\nscattering the contents around. One of the spores is seen more\r\nmagnified below. The spore-cases of many ferns may be seen bursting\r\nunder the microscope, and have a very curious appearance, writhing and\r\ntwisting like worms, and then suddenly filling the field with a cloud\r\nof spores. Fig. 9, Plate V., is a piece of the brown, chaff-like, scaly\r\nstructure found at the base of the stalk of male fern cells, showing\r\nthe manner in which a flat membrane is formed. Fig. 39 is a capsule of\r\nthe Hypnum, one of the mosses, showing the beautiful double fringe with\r\nwhich its edge is crowned. Fig. 2, Plate V., is the capsule of another\r\nmoss, Polytríchum, to show the toothed rim; on the right hand is one of\r\nthe teeth much more magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate V., is the capsule of the Jungermannia, one of the\r\nliverworts, showing the “elaters” bursting out on every side, and\r\nscattering the spores. Fig. 4 is a single elater much magnified,\r\nshowing it to be a spirally coiled filament, that, by sudden expansion,\r\nshoots out the spores just as a child’s toy-gun discharges the arrow.\r\nFig. 5 is a part of the leaf of the Sphagnum moss, common in fresh\r\nwater, showing the curious spiral arrangement of secondary fibre which\r\nis found in the cells, as well as the circular pores which are found\r\nin each cell at a certain stage of growth. Just below, and to the\r\nleft hand, is a single cell greatly magnified, in order to show these\r\npeculiarities more strongly. Fig. 8 is part of a leaf of Jungermannia,\r\nshowing the dotted cells.\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate V., is a part of a rootlet of moss, showing how it is\r\nformed of cells elongated and joined end to end.\r\n\r\nOn the common mare’s-tail, or Equisétum, may be seen a very remarkable\r\narrangement for scattering the spores. On the last joint of the stem\r\nis a process called a fruit-spike, being a pointed head around which\r\nare set a number of little bodies just like garden-tables, with their\r\ntops outward. One of these bodies is seen in Fig. 40. From the top of\r\nthe table depend a number of tiny pouches, which are called sporangia;\r\nthese lie closely against each other, and contain the spores. At the\r\nproper moment these pouches burst from the inside, and fling out the\r\nspores, which then look like round balls with irregular surfaces, as\r\nshown in Fig. 40, _c_. This irregularity is caused by four elastic\r\nfilaments, knobbed at the end, which are originally coiled tightly\r\nround the body of the spore, but by rapidly untwisting themselves cause\r\nthe spore to leap about, and so aid in the distribution. A spore with\r\nuncoiled filaments is seen at Fig. 40, _b_. By breathing on them they\r\nmay be made to repeat this process at will.\r\n\r\nFig. 36 is a common little sea-weed, called Ectocarpus siliculósus,\r\nthat is found parasitically adhering to large plants, and is figured in\r\norder to show the manner in which the extremities of the branches are\r\ndeveloped into sporangia. Fig. 37 is a piece of the common green laver,\r\nUlva latíssima, showing the green masses that are ultimately converted\r\ninto zoospores, and by their extraordinary fertility cause the plant to\r\ngrow with such rapid luxuriance wherever the conditions are favourable.\r\nEvery possessor of a marine aquarium knows how rapidly the glass sides\r\nbecome covered with growing masses of this plant. The smaller figure\r\nabove is a section of the same plant, showing that it is composed of a\r\ndouble plate of cellular tissue.\r\n\r\nFig. 41 is a piece of purple laver or “sloke,” Porphýra laciniáta, to\r\nshow the manner in which the cells are arranged in groups of four,\r\ntechnically named “tetraspores.” This plant has only one layer of cells.\r\n\r\nOn Plate V. may be seen a number of curious details of the higher algæ.\r\n\r\nFig. 11 is the Sphacelária, so called from the curious capsule cells\r\nfound at the end of the branches, and termed sphacelæ. This portion\r\nof the plant is shown more magnified in Fig. 12. Another sea-weed is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 13, in order to show the manner in which the fruit\r\nis arranged; and a portion of the same plant is given on a larger scale\r\nat Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nA very pretty little sea-weed called Cerámium is shown at Fig. 15; and\r\na portion showing the fruit much more magnified is drawn at Fig. 22.\r\nFig. 23 is a little alga called Myrionéma, growing parasitically on the\r\npreceding plant.\r\n\r\nFig. 16 is a section of a capsule belonging to the Hálydris siliquósa,\r\nshowing the manner in which the fruit is arranged; and Fig. 17 shows\r\none of the spores more magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 18 shows the Polysiphónia parasítica, a rather common species of\r\na very extensive genus of sea-weeds, containing nearly three hundred\r\nspecies. Fig. 19 is a portion of the stem of the same plant, cut across\r\nin order to show the curious mode in which it is built up of a number\r\nof longitudinal cells, surrounding a central cell of large dimensions,\r\nso that a section of this plant has the aspect of a rosette when placed\r\nunder the microscope. A capsule or “ceramídium” of the same plant is\r\nshown at Fig. 20, for the purpose of exhibiting the pear-shaped spores,\r\nand the mode of their escape from the parent-cell previous to their\r\nown development into fresh plants. The same plant has another form\r\nof reproduction, shown in Fig. 21, where the “tetraspores” are seen\r\nimbedded in the substance of the branches. There is yet a third mode\r\nof reproduction by means of “antheridia,” or elongated white tufts at\r\nthe extremities of the branches. The cells produced by these tufts\r\nfertilise the rudimentary capsules, and so fulfil the function of the\r\npollen in flowering plants.\r\n\r\nFig. 25 is the Cladóphora, a green alga, figured to illustrate its mode\r\nof growth; and Fig. 26 represents one of the red sea-weeds, Ptilóta\r\nélegans, beautifully feathered, and with a small portion shown also\r\non a larger scale, in order to show its structure more fully. A good\r\ncontrast to this species is seen on Fig. 27, and the mode in which the\r\nlong, slender, filamentary fronds are built up of many-sided cells is\r\nseen just to the left hand of the upper frond. Fig. 24 is a portion of\r\nthe lovely Delesséria sanguínea, given in order to show the formation\r\nof the cells, as also the arrangement by which the indistinct nervures\r\nare formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

The specimen here represented has a gathering\r\nof spores upon the frond, in which state the frond is said to be “in\r\nfruit.”\r\n\r\nFig. 27 represents a portion of the common sea-grass (_Enteromorpha_),\r\nso common on rocks and stones between the range of high and low water.\r\nOn the left hand of the figure, and near the top, is a small piece of\r\nthe same plant much more magnified, in order to show the form of its\r\ncells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  Antennæ, their Structure and Use--Eyes, Compound and\r\n  Simple--Breathing Organs--Jaws and their Appendages--Legs, Feet,\r\n  and Suckers--Digestive Organs--Wings, Scales, and Hairs--Eggs\r\n  of Insects--Hair, Wool, Linen, Silk, and Cotton--Scales of\r\n  Fish--Feathers--Skin and its Structure--Epithelium--Nails, Bone, and\r\n  Teeth--Blood Corpuscles and Circulation--Elastic Tissues--Muscle and\r\n  Nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now take leave of the vegetables for a time, and turn our attention\r\nto the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn Plate VI. may be seen many beautiful examples of animal structures,\r\nmost of them being taken from the insect tribes. We will begin with the\r\nantennæ, or horns, as they are popularly termed, of the insect.\r\n\r\nThe forms of these organs are as varied as those of the insects to\r\nwhich they belong, and they are so well defined that a single antenna\r\nwill, in almost every instance, enable a good entomologist to designate\r\nthe genus to which the insect belonged. The functions of the antennæ\r\nare not satisfactorily ascertained. They are certainly often used as\r\norgans of speech, as may be seen when two ants meet each other, cross\r\ntheir antennæ, and then start off simultaneously to some task which is\r\ntoo much for a single ant. This pretty scene may be witnessed on any\r\nfine day in a wood, and a very animated series of conversations may\r\nreadily be elicited by laying a stick across their paths, or putting a\r\ndead mouse or large insect in their way.\r\n\r\nI once saw a very curious scene of this kind take place at an ant’s\r\nnest near Hastings. A great daddy long-legs had, unfortunately for\r\nitself, settled on the nest, and was immediately “pinned” by an ant or\r\ntwo at each leg, so effectually that all its struggles availed nothing.\r\nHelp was, however, needed, and away ran four or five ants in different\r\ndirections, intercepting every comrade they met, and by a touch of the\r\nantennæ sending them off in the proper direction. A large number of the\r\nwise insects soon crowded round the poor victim, whose fate was rapidly\r\nsealed. Every ant took its proper place, just like a gang of labourers\r\nunder the orders of their foreman; and by dint of pushing and pulling,\r\nthe long-legged insect was dragged to one of the entrances of the nest,\r\nand speedily disappeared.\r\n\r\nMany of the ichneumon-flies may also be seen quivering their antennæ\r\nwith eager zeal, and evidently using them as feelers, to ascertain the\r\npresence of the insect in which they intend to lay their eggs; and many\r\nother similar instances will be familiar to anyone who has been in the\r\nhabit of watching insects and their ways.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, most likely that the antennæ serve other purposes than\r\nthat which has just been mentioned, and many entomologists are of\r\nopinion that they serve as organs of hearing.\r\n\r\nFig. 15, Plate VI., represents a part of one of the joints belonging to\r\nthe antennæ of the common house-fly; it is seen to be covered with a\r\nmultitude of little depressions, some being small, and others very much\r\nlarger. A section of the same antenna, but on a larger scale, is shown\r\nby Fig. 16, in order to exhibit the real form of these depressions.\r\nNerves have been traced to these curious cavities, which evidently\r\nserve some very useful purpose, some authors thinking them to belong to\r\nthe sense of smell, and others to that of hearing. Perhaps they may be\r\nthe avenues of some sensation not possessed by the human race, and of\r\nwhich we are therefore ignorant. Fig. 17 represents a section of the\r\nantennæ of an ichneumon-fly, to show the structure of these organs of\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nWe will now glance cursorily at the forms of antennæ which are depicted\r\nin the Plate.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is the antenna of the common cricket, which consists of a vast\r\nnumber of little joints, each a trifle smaller than the preceding one,\r\nthe whole forming a long, thread-like organ. Fig. 2 is taken from the\r\ngrasshopper, and shows that the joints are larger in the middle than at\r\neither end.\r\n\r\nFigs. 3 and 5 are from two minute species of cocktailed beetles\r\n(_Staphylínidæ_), which swarm throughout the summer months, and even in\r\nthe winter may be found in profusion under stones and moss. The insect\r\nfrom which Fig. 5 was taken is so small that it is almost invisible\r\nto the naked eye, and was captured on the wing by waving a sheet of\r\ngummed paper under the shade of a tree. These are the tiresome little\r\ninsects that so often get into the eye in the summer, and cause such\r\npain and inconvenience until they are removed.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows the antenna of the tortoise beetle (_Cássida_), so common\r\non many leaves, and remarkable for its likeness to the reptile from\r\nwhich it derives its popular name. Fig. 3 is from one of the weevils,\r\nand shows the extremely long basal joint of the antennæ of these\r\nbeetles, as well as the clubbed extremity. Fig. 7 is the beautifully\r\nnotched antenna of the cardinal beetle (_Pyrochróa_), and Fig. 11 is\r\nthe fan-like one of the common cockchafer. This specimen is taken from\r\na male insect, and the reader will find his trouble repaid on mounting\r\none of these antennæ as a permanent object.\r\n\r\nFig. 12 is an antenna from one of the common ground beetles (_Cárabus_)\r\nlooking like a string of elongated pears, from the form of the joints.\r\nThe reader will see that in beetles he is sure to find eleven joints in\r\nthe antennæ.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 is the entire antenna of a fly (_Syrphus_), one of those pretty\r\nflies which may be seen hovering over one spot for a minute, and then\r\ndarting off like lightning to hang over another. The large joint is the\r\none on which are found those curious depressions that have already been\r\nmentioned. Fig. 8 is one of the antennæ of a tortoise-shell butterfly\r\n(_Vanessa_), showing the slender, knobbed form which butterfly\r\nantennæ assume; and Figs. 13 and 14 are specimens of moths’ antennæ,\r\nshowing how they always terminate in a point. Fig. 13 is the beautiful\r\nfeathery antenna of the ermine moth (_Spilosóma_); and Fig. 14 is the\r\ntoothed one of the tiger moth (_Arctia caja_). In all these feathered\r\nand toothed antennæ of moths, the male insects have them much more\r\ndeveloped than the female, probably for the purpose of enabling them\r\nto detect the presence of their mates, a property which some possess\r\nin wonderful perfection. The male oak-egger moth, for example, can be\r\nobtained in any number by putting a female into a box with a perforated\r\nlid, placing the box in a room, and opening the window. In the course\r\nof the evening seven or eight males are seen to make their appearance,\r\nand they are so anxious to get at their intended mate that they will\r\nsuffer themselves to be taken by hand.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 is an antenna of the male gnat, a most beautiful object,\r\nremarkable for the delicate transparency of the joints, and the\r\nexquisitely fine feathering with which they are adorned.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the eyes of the insects, all of which are very\r\nbeautiful, and many singularly full of interest.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of Plate VI. may be seen the front view of the head\r\nof a bee, showing both kinds of eyes, three simple eyes arranged\r\ntriangularly in the centre, and two large masses, compound eyes, at the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThe simple eyes, termed “ocelli,” are from one to three in number, and\r\nusually arranged in a triangular form between the two compound eyes.\r\nExternally they look merely like shining rounded projections, and can\r\nbe seen to great advantage in the dragon-flies. The compound eyes may\r\nbe considered as aggregations of simple eyes, set closely together,\r\nand each assuming a more or less perfect six-sided form. Their number\r\nvaries very greatly; in some insects, such as the common fly, there are\r\nabout four thousand of these simple eyes in one compound one, in the\r\nant only fifty, in the dragon-fly about twelve thousand, and in one of\r\nthe beetles more than twenty-five thousand.\r\n\r\nFig. 18 shows a portion of the compound eye of the Atalanta butterfly,\r\nand Fig. 20 the same organ of the death’s-head moth. A number of\r\nthe protecting hairs may be seen still adhering to the eye of the\r\nbutterfly. Fig. 22 is a remarkably good specimen of the eye of a fly\r\n(_Helióphilus_), showing the facets, nearly square, the tubes to\r\nwhich they are attached, and portions of the optic nerves. Fig. 23\r\nis part of the compound eye of a lobster, showing the facets quite\r\nsquare. All these drawings were taken by the camera lucida from my own\r\npreparations, so that I can answer for their authenticity.\r\n\r\nOn Plate VIII. Figs. 6 and 12, the reader will find two more examples\r\nof eyes, these being taken from the spiders. Fig. 6 is an example of\r\nthe eight eyes of the well-known zebra spider, so common on our garden\r\nwalls and similar situations, hunting incessantly after flies and other\r\nprey, and capturing them by a sudden pounce. The eyes are like the\r\nocelli of insects, and are simple in their construction. The number,\r\narrangement, and situation of the eyes is extremely varied in spiders,\r\nand serves as one of the readiest modes of distinguishing the species.\r\nFig. 12, Plate VIII., represents one of the curious eyes of the common\r\nharvest spider, perched on a prominence or “watch-tower” (as it has\r\nbeen aptly named), for the purpose of enabling the creature to take a\r\nmore comprehensive view of surrounding objects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning to Plate VI., in Fig. 21 we see a curiously branched\r\nappearance, something like the hollow root of a tree, and covered with\r\ndelicate spiral markings. This is part of the breathing apparatus of\r\nthe silkworm, extracted and prepared by myself for the purpose of\r\nshowing the manner in which the tubes branch off from the “spiracle”\r\nor external breathing-hole, a row of which may be seen along the\r\nsides of insects, together with the beautiful spiral filament which\r\nis wound round each tube for the purpose of strengthening it. One of\r\nthese spiracles may be seen in the neck of the gnat (Fig. 27). Another\r\nspiracle, more enlarged, may be seen on Plate VII. Fig. 34, taken from\r\nthe wireworm, _i.e._ the larva of the skipjack beetle (_Eláter_), to\r\nshow the apparatus for excluding dust and admitting air. The object of\r\nthe spiral coil is very evident, for as these breathing-tubes extend\r\nthroughout the whole body and limbs, they would fail to perform their\r\noffice when the limbs were bent, unless for some especial provision.\r\nThis is achieved by the winding of a very strong but slender filament\r\nbetween the membranes of which the tube is composed, so that it always\r\nremains open for the passage of air throughout all the bends to which\r\nit may be subjected. Flexible tubes for gas and similar purposes are\r\nmade after the same fashion, spiral metal wire being coiled within\r\nthe india-rubber pipe. A little piece of this thread is seen unwound\r\nat the end of a small branch towards the top, and this thread is so\r\nstrong that it retains its elasticity when pulled away from the tube,\r\nand springs back into its spiral form. I have succeeded in unwinding\r\na considerable length of this filament from the breathing-tube of a\r\nhumble bee.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 represents the two curious tubercles upon the hinder quarters\r\nof the common green-blight, or Aphis, so very common on our garden\r\nplants, as well as on many trees and other vegetables. From the tips of\r\nthese tubercles exudes a sweet colourless fluid, which, after it has\r\nfallen upon the leaves, is popularly known by the name of honey-dew.\r\nAnts are very fond of this substance, and are in the habit of haunting\r\nthe trees upon which the aphides live, for the purpose of sucking the\r\nhoney-dew as it exudes from their bodies. A drop of this liquid may be\r\nseen on the extremity of the lower tubercle.\r\n\r\nThe head of the same insect may be seen in Fig. 24, where the reader\r\nmay observe the bright scarlet eye, and the long beak with which the\r\naphis punctures the leaves and sucks the sap. Fig. 29 is the head of\r\nthe sheep-tick, exhibiting the organ by which it pierces the skin of\r\nthe creature on which it lives. Fig. 25 is the head of another curious\r\nparasite found upon the tortoise, and remarkable for the powerful\r\nhooked apparatus which projects in front of the head.\r\n\r\nTurning to Plate VII. Fig. 4, we find the head of a ground beetle\r\n(_Cárabus_), valuable as exhibiting the whole of the organs of the head\r\nand mouth.\r\n\r\nImmediately above the compound eyes are seen the roots of the antennæ,\r\nthose organs themselves being cut away. Above there are two pairs of\r\nsimilarly constructed organs termed the “maxillary palpi,” because\r\nthey belong to the lesser jaws or maxillæ, seen just within the pair\r\nof great curved jaws called the mandibles, which are extended in so\r\nthreatening a manner. The “labial palpi,” so called because they\r\nbelong to the “labium,” or under lip, are seen just within the others;\r\nthe tongue is seen between the maxillæ, and the chin or “mentum”\r\nforms a defence for the base of the maxillæ and the palpi. A careful\r\nexamination of a beetle’s mouth with the aid of a pocket lens is very\r\ninstructive as well as interesting.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 on the same Plate shows the jaws of the hive bee, where the same\r\norgans are seen modified into many curious shapes. In the centre may be\r\nseen the tongue, elongated into a flexible and hair-covered instrument,\r\nused for licking the honey from the interior of flowers. At each side\r\nof the tongue are the labial palpi, having their outermost joints very\r\nsmall, and the others extremely large, the latter acting as a kind\r\nof sheath for the tongue. Outside the labial palpi are the maxillæ,\r\nseparated in the specimen, but capable of being laid closely upon each\r\nother, and outside all are the mandibles.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Another elongated\r\nhead, belonging to the daddy long-legs, is seen in Plate VI. Fig. 27,\r\nand well shows the compound eyes, the antennæ, and the palpi. Fig. 2\r\nrepresents the coiled tongue of the Atalanta butterfly; it is composed\r\nof the maxillæ, very greatly developed, and appearing as if each\r\nhad originally been flat, and then rolled up so as to make about\r\nthree-fourths of a tube. A number of projections are seen towards the\r\ntip, and one of these little bodies is shown on a larger scale at\r\nFig. 3. These curious organs have probably some connection with the\r\nsense of taste. Along the edges of the semi-tubes are arranged a number\r\nof very tiny hooks, by means of which the insect can unite the edges at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nFig. 11, in the centre of the Plate, shows one of the most curious\r\nexamples of insect structure, the proboscis or trunk of the common\r\nbluebottle-fly. The maxillary palpi covered with bristles are seen\r\nprojecting at each side, and upon the centre are three lancet-like\r\nappendages, two small and one large, which are used for perforating\r\nvarious substances on which the insect feeds. The great double disc\r\nat the end is composed of the lower lip greatly developed, and is\r\nfilled with a most complex arrangement of sucking-tubes, in order to\r\nenable it to fulfil its proper functions. The numerous tubes which\r\nradiate towards the circumference are strengthened by a vast number\r\nof partial rings of strong filamentary substance, like that which we\r\nhave already seen in the breathing-tube of the silkworm. Some of these\r\npartial rings are seen on Fig. 12, a little above. The mode in which\r\nthe horny matter composing the rings is arranged upon the tubes is most\r\nwonderful, and requires a tolerably high power to show it. The fine\r\nhairs upon the proboscis itself afford most admirable practice for the\r\nyoung microscopist. They should, when properly lighted and focused, be\r\nquite black and sharp. Any errors of manipulation will cause them to be\r\n“fuzzy.”\r\n\r\nFig. 5 shows the tongue of the common cricket, a most elegantly formed\r\norgan, having a number of radiating bands covered with zigzag lines,\r\ndue to the triangular plates of strengthening substance with which they\r\nare furnished, instead of the rings. A portion more highly magnified\r\nis shown at Fig. 6, exhibiting the manner in which the branches are\r\narranged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe legs of insects now claim our attention.\r\n\r\nFig. 9, Plate VII., shows the “pro-leg” of a caterpillar. The pro-legs\r\nare situated on the hinder parts of the caterpillar, and, being set in\r\npairs, take a wonderfully firm hold of a branch or twig by pressure\r\ntoward each other. Around the pro-legs are arranged a series of sharp\r\nhooks, set with their points inwards, for greater power in holding.\r\nFig. 10 represents one of the hooks more magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 15 is the lower portion of the many-jointed legs of the\r\nlong-legged spider (_Phalángium_), the whole structure looking very\r\nlike the antenna of the cricket. Fig. 17 is the leg of the glow-worm,\r\nshowing the single claw with which it is armed. Fig. 26 shows the foot\r\nof the flea, furnished with two simple claws. Fig. 16 is the foot of\r\nthe Trombídium, a genus of parasitic creatures, to which the well-known\r\nharvest-bug belongs. Fig. 26, Plate VI., shows the leg of the green\r\nAphis of the geranium, exhibiting the double claw, and the pad or\r\ncushion, which probably serves the same purpose as the pads found upon\r\nthe feet of many other insects. Fig. 8 is the lower portion of the leg\r\nof the ant, showing the two claws and the curious pad in the centre,\r\nby means of which the insect is able to walk upon slippery surfaces.\r\nThe Típula has a foot also furnished with a single pad (see Plate VI.\r\nFig. 30). This organ is seen under a very high power to be covered with\r\nlong hair-like appendages, each having a little disc at the end, and\r\nprobably secreting some glutinous fluid which will enable the creature\r\nto hold on to perpendicular and smooth surfaces. Many of my readers\r\nwill doubtless have noticed the common fly, towards the end of autumn,\r\nwalking stiffly upon the walls, and evidently detaching each foot with\r\ngreat difficulty, age and infirmity having made the insect unable to\r\nlift its feet with the requisite force.\r\n\r\nFig. 21 is the foot of one of the ichneumon-flies (_Ophíon_), the\r\nhairy fringe being apparently for the purpose of enabling it to hold\r\nfirmly to the caterpillar in which it is depositing its eggs, and\r\nwhich wriggles so violently under the infliction that it would soon\r\nthrow its tormentor had not some special means been provided for the\r\npurpose of enabling the latter to keep its hold. Fig. 20 is a beautiful\r\nexample of a padded foot, taken from the little red parasitic creature\r\nso plentifully found upon the dor or dung beetle (_Geotrúpes_), and of\r\nwhich the afflicted insect is said to rid itself by lying on its back\r\nnear an ant’s nest, and waiting until the ants carry off its tormentors.\r\n\r\nFig. 18 is the foot of the common yellow dung-fly (plentiful in pasture\r\nlands), having two claws and two pads; and Fig. 19 shows the three pads\r\nand two claws found in the foot of the hornet-fly (_Ásilus_).\r\n\r\nFew microscopic objects call forth such general and deserved admiration\r\nas the fore-foot of the male water-beetle (_Dytiscus_), when properly\r\nprepared and mounted, for which see Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nOn examining this preparation under the microscope, it is seen that\r\nthree of the joints are greatly expanded, and that the whole of their\r\nunder surface is covered profusely with certain wonderful projections,\r\nwhich are known to act as suckers. One of them is exceedingly large,\r\nand occupies a very considerable space, its hairs radiating like the\r\nrays of the heraldic sun. Another is also large, but scarcely half\r\nthe diameter of the former, and the remainder are small, and mounted\r\non the extremities of delicate foot-stalks, looking something like\r\nwide-mouthed trumpets. In the specimen from which the drawing was taken\r\nthe smaller suckers are well shown, as they protrude from the margin of\r\nthe foot.\r\n\r\nOne of the larger suckers is seen more magnified on Fig. 14.\r\n\r\nPlate VIII. Fig. 1, exemplifies the manner in which the muscles of\r\ninsects do their work, being well attached in the limbs to the central\r\ntendon, and pulling “with a will” in one direction, thus giving very\r\ngreat strength. This leg is taken from the water boatman (_Notonecta_),\r\nand has been mounted in Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nOn Plate VII. Fig. 29, may be seen a curiously formed creature. This\r\nis the larva of the tortoise beetle (_Cássida_), the skin having been\r\nflattened and mounted in Canada balsam. The spiracles are visible\r\nalong the sides, and at the end is seen a dark fork-like structure.\r\nThis is one of the peculiarities of this creature, and is employed for\r\nthe purpose of carrying the refuse of its food, which is always piled\r\nupon its back, and retained in its place by the forked spines, aided\r\nprobably by the numerous smaller spines that project from the side.\r\n\r\nFig. 33 shows part of the stomach and gastric teeth of the grasshopper.\r\nThis structure may be seen to perfection in the “gizzard,” as it is\r\ncalled, of the great green locust of England (_Ácrida viridíssima_).\r\nThe organ looks like a sudden swelling of the œsophagus, and when slit\r\nlongitudinally under water, the teeth may be seen in rows set side by\r\nside, and evidently having a great grinding power. The common house\r\ncricket has a similar organ of remarkable beauty. Just above (Fig. 27)\r\nis the corresponding structure in the hive bee, three of the teeth\r\nbeing shown separately at Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now cast a rapid glance at the wings of insects.\r\n\r\nThey have no analogy, except in their use, with the wings of birds, as\r\nthey are not modifications of existing limbs, but entirely separate\r\norgans. They consist of two membranes united at their edges, and\r\ntraversed and supported by sundry hollow branches or “nervures,” which\r\nadmit air, and serve as useful guides to entomologists for separating\r\nthe insects into their genera. Indeed, the general character of the\r\nwings has long been employed as the means of dividing the insect race\r\ninto their different orders, as may be seen in any work on entomology.\r\nThe typical number of wings is four, but it often happens that two are\r\nalmost wholly absent, or that the uppermost pair are thickened into a\r\nshelly kind of substance which renders them useless for flight; while\r\nin many insects, such as the ground beetles and others, the upper wings\r\nbecome hardened into firm coverings for the body, and the lower pair\r\nare shrivelled and useless.\r\n\r\nFig. 22 shows two of the wings of a humble bee, together with their\r\nnervures, and the peculiar system by which the upper and lower pair are\r\nunited together at the will of the insect. At the upper edge of the\r\nlower wing, and nearly at its extremity, may be seen a row of very tiny\r\nhooks, shown on a larger scale at Fig. 25. These hooklets hitch into\r\nthe strengthened membrane of the upper wing, which is seen immediately\r\nabove them, and so conjoin the two together. The curious wing-hooks of\r\nthe Aphis may be seen on Fig. 24, very highly magnified.\r\n\r\nFig. 31 is the wing of the midge (_Psychóda_), that odd little insect\r\nwhich is seen hopping and popping about on the windows of outhouses\r\nand similar localities, and is so hard to catch. The whole wing is\r\nplentifully covered with elongated scales, and is a most lovely object\r\nunder any power of the microscope. These scales run along the nervures\r\nand edges of the wings, and part of a nervure is shown more highly\r\nmagnified at Fig. 32.\r\n\r\nAt Fig. 23 is shown the wing of one of the hemipterous insects, common\r\nalong the banks of ditches and in shady lanes, and known by the name\r\nof Cíxius. It is remarkable for the numerous spots which stud the\r\nnervures, one being always found at each forking, and the others being\r\nvery irregularly disposed.\r\n\r\nFig. 30 is one of the balancers or “haltéres” of the house-fly. These\r\norgans are found in all the two-winged insects, and are evidently\r\nmodifications of the second pair of wings. They are covered with\r\nlittle vesicles, and protected at their base by scales. Some writers\r\nsuppose that the sense of smell resides in these organs. Whatever other\r\npurpose they may serve, they clearly aid in the flight, as, if the\r\ninsect be deprived of one or both of the balancers, it has the greatest\r\ndifficulty in steering itself through the air.\r\n\r\nThe wings of insects are mostly covered with hairs or scales, several\r\nexamples of which are given in Plate VIII. Fig. 4 shows one of the\r\nscales of the Adippe or fritillary butterfly, exhibiting the double\r\nmembrane--part of which has been torn away--and the beautiful lines of\r\ndots with which it is marked. The structure of the scales is further\r\nshown by a torn specimen of tiger moth scale seen on Fig. 16. On\r\nmany scales these dots assume a “watered” aspect when the focus or\r\nillumination changes, an example of which may be seen in Fig. 15, a\r\nscale of the peacock butterfly.\r\n\r\nFig. 11 is one of the ordinary scales of the azure blue butterfly,\r\nand Fig. 10 shows one of the curious “battledore” scales of the same\r\ninsect, with its rows of distinct dottings. Fig. 14 is one of the\r\nprettily tufted scales of the orange-tip butterfly, and Fig. 8 is the\r\nsplendid branched scale of the death’s-head moth. Fig. 19 shows a scale\r\nof the sugar-runner (_Lepisma saccharína_), a little silvery creature\r\nwith glistening skin, and long bristles at the head and tail, that is\r\nfound running about cupboards, window-sills, and similar places. It\r\nis not easy to catch with the fingers, as it slips through them like\r\noil; but by holding a cover-glass in a pair of forceps, and pressing it\r\nupon one of the little creatures, a number of the scales may be caused\r\nto adhere to it, and these should be mounted dry for examination. The\r\ngnats also possess very pretty scales, with the ribs projecting beyond\r\nthe membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1. Tongue, Hive Bee\r\n   2.   Do.

Some flour scattered on a\r\npiece of paper is a sure trap for these little beings. Fig. 3 is one\r\nof the scales taken from the back of the celebrated diamond beetle,\r\nshowing the cause of the magnificent gem-like aspect of that insect. We\r\nhave in England many beetles of the same family--the weevils--which,\r\nalthough much smaller, are quite as splendid when exhibited under a\r\nmicroscope by reflected light. The wing-case or “elytron” of a little\r\ngreen weevil, very common in the hedges, may be seen on Plate XII.\r\nFig. 10.\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that all these scales are furnished with little\r\nroot-like appendages, by means of which they are affixed to the insect.\r\nFig. 13 shows a portion of the wing of the azure blue butterfly, from\r\nwhich nearly all the scales have been removed, for the purpose of\r\nexhibiting the pits or depressions in which they had formerly been\r\nfastened, and one or two of the scales are left still adherent to their\r\nplaces. The scales are arranged in equal rows like the slates of a\r\nhousetop, as may be seen on Fig. 18, which represents part of the same\r\nwing, to show the scales overlapping each other, and the elegant form\r\nwhich they take near the edges of the wing, so as to form a delicate\r\nfringe. The long hair-like down which covers the legs and bodies of the\r\nmoths and butterflies (which are called Lepidóptera, or scale-winged\r\ninsects, in consequence of this peculiarity), is seen under the\r\nmicroscope to be composed of scales very much elongated, as is shown in\r\nFig. 17, a portion taken from the leg of a tiger moth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eggs of insects are all very beautiful, and three of the most\r\ncurious forms are given on Plate VIII.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 is the empty egg of the gad-fly, as it appears when fastened to\r\na hair of the horse. Fig. 5 represents the pretty ribbed egg of the\r\ncommon tortoise-shell butterfly; and Fig. 7 is the very beautiful egg\r\nof the very horrid bed-bug, worthy of notice on account of the curious\r\nlid with which its extremity is closed, by means of which the young\r\nlarva creeps out as soon as it is hatched.\r\n\r\nThe feathers of birds, and the fur of animals, will furnish many\r\nexamples of the eggs of parasites, some of which are of extreme beauty.\r\nThe feather or hair may be mounted in a cell without disturbing the\r\neggs, which should, however, be heated sufficiently to kill the embryo\r\nif present.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 shows the penetrating portions of the sting of the wasp. The\r\ntwo barbed stings, which seem to be the minute prototypes of the\r\nmany-barbed spears of the South Sea islanders, are seen lying one at\r\neach side of their sheath, and a single barb is drawn a little to the\r\nleft on a very much larger scale. It is by reason of these barbs that\r\nthe sting is always left adhering to the wound, and is generally drawn\r\nwholly out of the insect, causing its death in a short while.\r\n\r\nThe sting is only found in female insects, and is supposed to be\r\nanalogous to the “ovipositor” of other insects, _i.e._ the instrument\r\nby which the eggs are deposited in their places. Fig. 20 shows the\r\ncurious egg-placing apparatus of one of the saw-flies. The backs of\r\nthese “saws” work in grooves, and they work alternately, so that the\r\nfly takes but a very short time in cutting a slit in the young bark\r\nof a tender shoot, and laying her eggs in the slit. When she has\r\ncompleted one of these channels, she sets to work upon another, and in\r\nthe early spring the young branches of the gooseberry bushes may be\r\nseen plentifully covered with these grooves and the eggs. When hatched,\r\nblack caterpillar-like grubs from the eggs issue, and devastate the\r\nbushes sadly, turning in process of time into blackish flies, which are\r\nseen hovering in numbers over the gooseberries, and may be killed by\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe scales and hairs of other animals deserve great attention. Fig. 23\r\nis a single hair of the human beard, as it often appears when tied in\r\na knot--by Queen Mab and her fairies, according to Mercutio. Fig. 22\r\nis a portion of the same hair as it appears when splitting at its\r\nextremity. The structure of the hair is not, however, so well seen in\r\nthis object as in that represented on Fig. 24, which is a beautiful\r\nexample of white human hair that once adorned the head of the victor\r\nof Waterloo. It formed one of a tiny lock given to me by a friend, and\r\nis so admirable an example of human hair, that I forthwith mounted\r\nit for the microscope. In this hair the cells may be seen extending\r\ndown its centre, and the peculiar roughened surface produced by the\r\nflattened cells which are arranged around its circumference are also\r\nseen. By steeping in caustic potash, these scales can be separated,\r\nbut generally they lie along the hair in such a manner that if the\r\nhair be drawn through the fingers from base to point, their projecting\r\nends permit it to pass freely; whilst if it be drawn in the reverse\r\ndirection, they cause it to feel very harsh to the touch.\r\n\r\nIn the sheep’s wool (Fig. 30) this structure is much more developed,\r\nand gives to the fibres the “felting” power that causes them to\r\ninterlace so firmly with each other, and enables cloth--when really\r\nmade of wool--to be cut without unravelling. Fig. 37 is the smooth hair\r\nof the badger; and Fig. 34 is the curious hair of the red deer, which\r\nlooks as if it had been covered with a delicate net.\r\n\r\nFig. 28 is the soft, grey, wool-like hair of the rat; and Fig. 29\r\nis one of the larger hairs that protrude so plentifully, and form\r\nthe glistening brown coat of that animal. Fig. 38 is the curiously\r\nknobbed hair of the long-eared bat, the knobs being formed of\r\nprotuberant scales that can easily be scraped off. Fig. 31 shows a\r\nhair of the common mole; and Fig. 32 is one of the long hairs of the\r\nrabbit. Fig. 27 is a flat hair of the dormouse, slightly twisted, the\r\ndifference in the breadth showing where the twist has taken place. The\r\nhair of the mouse is beautifully ribbed, so as to look like a ladder.\r\nFig. 26 is one of the very long hairs that so thickly clothe the tiger\r\nmoth caterpillar; and Fig. 25 is a beautifully branched hair taken from\r\nthe common humble bee.\r\n\r\nAll hairs should be examined by polarised light, with a plate of\r\nselenite, when most gorgeous colour effects may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe four fibres mostly used in the manufacture of apparel are: wool,\r\nFig. 30, which has already been described; linen, Fig. 39; cotton,\r\nFig. 40; and silk, Fig. 41. The structure of each is very well marked\r\nand easily made out with the microscope; so that an adulterated article\r\ncan readily be detected by a practised eye. Cotton is the most common\r\nadulteration of silk and linen fabrics, and may at once be detected\r\nby its flat twisted fibre. Silk is always composed of two parallel\r\nthreads, each proceeding from one of the spinnerets of the caterpillar,\r\nand it may be here remarked that if these threads are not quite\r\nparallel the silk is of bad quality. Silken fibre is always covered,\r\nwhen new, with a kind of varnish, usually of a bright orange colour,\r\nwhich gives the undressed “floss” silk its peculiar hue, but which is\r\nsoluble and easily washed away in the course of manufacture.\r\n\r\nFigs. 35 and 36 are the small and large hairs of that magnificent\r\ncreature, the sea mouse (_Aphrodíte aculeáta_), whose covering,\r\nalthough it lies in the mud, glows with every hue of the rainbow, and\r\nin a brilliant light is almost painfully dazzling to the eye.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

The scales are\r\nalways enveloped in membranous sacs, and in some cases, as in the\r\neel, they do not project beyond the surface, and require some little\r\nobservation to detect them. A scale of an eel is shown on Plate XI.\r\nFig. 14, and is a magnificent object under polarised light. Fig. 33\r\nis a scale of the greenbone pike; and Figs. 42 and 43 are scales of\r\nthe perch, showing the roots by which they are held in their places.\r\nThe roach, dace, bleak, and many other similar fish have a beautiful\r\nsilvery substance on the under surface of the scales, which was greatly\r\nused in the manufacture of artificial pearls, glass beads being thinly\r\ncoated in the interior with the glittering substance, and then filled\r\nin with wax. A piece of sole-skin, when preserved in Canada balsam and\r\nplaced under the microscope, is a very beautiful object.\r\n\r\nMore examples of hairs, and other processes from the skin, together\r\nwith the structure of the skin itself, of bone, of blood, and the mode\r\nin which it circulates, are given on Plate X.\r\n\r\nIn all important points of their structure the feathers of birds\r\nare similar to the hairs of animals, and are developed in a similar\r\nmanner. They are all composed of a quill portion, in which the pith\r\nis contained, and of a shaft, which carries the vane, together with\r\nits barbs. The form of each of these portions varies much, even in\r\ndifferent parts of the same bird, and the same feather has almost\r\nalways two kinds of barbs; one close and firm, and the other loose,\r\nfloating, and downy. If a small feather be plucked from the breast\r\nor back of a sparrow or any other small bird, the upper part of the\r\nfeather is seen to be close and firm, while the lower is loose and\r\ndowny, the upper part being evidently intended to lie closely on the\r\nbody and keep out the wet, while the lower portion affords a soft and\r\nwarm protection to the skin.\r\n\r\nFig. 12, Plate X., shows the feather of a peacock, wherein the barbs\r\nare very slightly fringed and lie quite loosely side by side. Fig. 18\r\nis part of the same structure, in a duck’s feather, wherein are seen\r\nthe curious hooks which enable each vane to take a firm hold of its\r\nneighbour, the whole feather being thus rendered firm, compact, and\r\ncapable of repelling water. The reader will not fail to notice the\r\nremarkable analogy between these hooks and those which connect the\r\nwings of the bee.\r\n\r\nFig. 17 is a part of the shaft of a young feather taken from the\r\ncanary, given for the purpose of showing the form of the cells\r\nof which the pith is composed. Fig. 20 is part of the down from a\r\nsparrow’s feather, showing its peculiar structure; and Fig. 21 is a\r\nportion of one of the long drooping feathers of the cock’s tail.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 exhibits a transverse section of one of the large hairs or\r\nspines from the hedgehog, and shows the disposition of the firm,\r\nhorn-like exterior, and the arrangement of the cells. Sections of\r\nvarious kinds of hair are interesting objects, and are easily made by\r\ntying a bundle of them together, soaking them in gum, hardening in\r\nspirit, and then cutting thin slices with a razor. A little glycerine\r\nwill dissolve the gum, and the sections of hair will be well shown.\r\nUnless some such precaution be taken, the elasticity of the hair will\r\ncause the tiny sections to fly in all directions, and there will be no\r\nhope of recovering them.\r\n\r\nSeveral examples of the skin are also given. Fig. 27 is a section\r\nthrough the skin of the human finger, including the whole of one of the\r\nlittle ridges which are seen upon the extremity of every finger, and\r\nhalf of two others. The cuticle, epidermis, or scarf-skin, as it is\r\nindifferently termed, is formed of cells or scales, much flattened and\r\nhorny in the upper layers, rounder and plumper below. The true skin,\r\nor “cutis,” is fibrous in structure, and lies immediately beneath, the\r\ntwo together constituting the skin, properly so called. Beneath lies a\r\nlayer of tissue filled with fatty globules, and containing the glands\r\nby which the perspiration is secreted.\r\n\r\nOne of the tubes or channels by which these glands are enabled to\r\npour their contents to the outside of the body, and, if they be kept\r\nperfectly clean, to disperse them into the air, is seen running up\r\nthe centre of the figure, and terminating in a cup-shaped orifice on\r\nthe surface of the cuticle. On the palm of the hand very nearly three\r\nthousand of these ducts lie within the compass of a square inch, and\r\nmore than a thousand in every square inch of the arm and other portions\r\nof the body, so that the multitude of these valuable organs may be well\r\nestimated, together with the absolute necessity for keeping the skin\r\nperfectly clean in order to enjoy full health.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows a specimen of epidermis taken from the skin of a frog,\r\nexhibiting the flattened cells which constitute that structure, and\r\nthe oval or slightly elongated nuclei, of which each cell has one. In\r\nFig. 32, a portion of a bat’s wing, the arrangement of the pigment\r\nis remarkably pretty. Immediately above, at Fig. 31, is some of the\r\npigment taken from the back of the human eye-ball. The shape of the\r\npigment cells is well shown. Similar specimens may easily be obtained\r\nfrom the back of a sheep’s eye which has been hardened in spirit, or\r\nfrom that of a boiled fish. Fig. 33 shows the pigment in the shell of\r\nthe prawn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn various parts of animal structures, such as the lining of internal\r\ncavities, the interior of the mouth, and other similar portions of\r\nthe body, the cells are developed into a special form, which is\r\ncalled “Epithélium,” and which corresponds to the epidermis of the\r\nexterior surface of the body. The cells which form this substance are\r\nof different shapes, according to their locality. On the tongue, for\r\nexample (for which see Fig. 11), they are flattened, and exhibit their\r\nnucleus, in which the nucléolus may be discovered with a little care.\r\nCells of this kind are rounded, as in the case just mentioned, or\r\nangular, and in either case they are termed squamous (_i.e._, scaly)\r\nepithelium. Sometimes they are like a number of cylinders, cones, or\r\npyramids, ranged closely together, and are then called cylindrical\r\nepithelium. Sometimes the free ends of cylindrical epithelium are\r\nfurnished with a number of vibrating filaments or cilia, and in this\r\ncase the structure is called “ciliated” epithelium. Cylindrical\r\nepithelium may be found in the ducts of the glands which open into\r\nthe intestines, as well as in the glands that secrete tears; and\r\nciliated epithelium is seen largely in the windpipe, the interior of\r\nthe nose, etc. A specimen taken from the nose is seen at Fig. 15. A\r\nbeautiful example of ciliated epithelium is to be found in the gills\r\nof the mussel. A portion of one of the yellowish bands which lie along\r\nthe edge of the shell on the opening side is carefully removed with\r\nsharp scissors, and examined in the shell-liquor, being protected\r\nfrom pressure by placing a piece of paper beneath each end of the\r\ncover-glass. Such a preparation is shown in Plate IX. Fig. 39, but no\r\ndrawing can give an idea of its wonderful beauty and interest. The\r\ncilia will continue to move for a long time after removal from the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBone in its various stages is figured on Plate X.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 is a good example of human bone, and is a thin transverse\r\nsection taken from the thigh. When cut across, bone exhibits a whitish\r\nstructure filled with little dottings that become more numerous towards\r\nthe centre, and are almost invisible towards the circumference. In the\r\ncentre of the bone there is a cavity, which contains marrow in the\r\nmammalia and air in the birds. When placed under a microscope, bone\r\npresents the appearance shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe large aperture in the centre is one of innumerable tubes that run\r\nalong the bone, and serve to allow a passage to the vessels which\r\nconvey blood from one part of the bone to another. They are technically\r\ncalled Haversian canals, and if a longitudinal section be made they\r\nwill be found running tolerably parallel, and communicating freely\r\nwith each other. Around each Haversian canal may be seen a number of\r\nlittle black spots with lines radiating in all directions, and looking\r\nsomething like flattened insects. These are termed bone-cells or\r\n“lacúnæ,” and the little black lines are called “canalículi.” In the\r\nliving state they contain cells which are concerned in the growth of\r\nthe bone, and these may be made evident by softening fresh bone with\r\nacid, cutting sections of it, and staining. When viewed by transmitted\r\nlight the lacunæ and canaliculi are black; but when seen by dark-field\r\nillumination the Haversian canals become black, and the lacunæ are\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nAs these canaliculi exist equally in every direction, it is impossible\r\nto make a section of bone without cutting myriads of them across; and\r\nwhen a high power is employed they look like little dots scattered over\r\nthe surface. A very pretty object can be made of the bone taken from a\r\nyoung animal which has been fed with madder, as the colour gets into\r\nthe bone and settles chiefly round the Haversian canal. A young pig is\r\na very good subject, so is a rabbit.\r\n\r\nFig. 16 is a similar section cut from the leg-bone of an ostrich.\r\n\r\nThe development of bone is beautifully shown in Fig. 30, a delicate\r\nslice taken from a pig’s rib. Above may be seen the gristle or\r\ncartilage, with the numerous rows of cells; below is the formed bone,\r\nwith one of the Haversian canals and its contents; while between the\r\ntwo may be seen the cartilage-cells gathering together and arranging\r\nthemselves into form. The cartilage-cells are well shown in Fig. 28,\r\nwhich is a portion of the cup which had contained the eye of a haddock.\r\n\r\nThe horn-like substances at the end of our fingers, which we call the\r\nnails, are composed of innumerable flattened cells. These cells are\r\ngenerally so fused together as to be quite indistinguishable even with\r\na microscope, but can be rendered visible by soaking a section of nail\r\nin liquor potassæ, which causes the cells to swell up and resume to a\r\ndegree their original rounded form.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the animal form is built up of cells, as is\r\nthe case with the vegetables, although the cells are not so variable\r\nin shape. They generally may be found to contain well-marked nuclei,\r\ntwo or more of the latter being often found within a single cell, and\r\nin many cases the tiny nucleoli are also visible. Good examples of\r\nthese cells may be obtained from the yolk of an egg, and by careful\r\nmanagement they may be traced throughout every part of the animal form.\r\n\r\nThe teeth have many of the constituents of bone, and in some of their\r\nparts are made after precisely the same fashion. When cut, the teeth\r\nare seen to consist of a hard substance, called enamel, which coats\r\ntheir upper surfaces, of dentine, or ivory, within the enamel, and of\r\n“cement,” which surrounds the fangs. In Fig. 26, Plate X., which is\r\na longitudinal section of the human “eye” tooth, is seen the ivory\r\noccupying the greater part of the tooth, coated by the enamel at the\r\ntop and the cement at the bottom. In the centre of each tooth there is\r\na cavity, which is plentifully filled with a pulpy substance by which\r\nthe tooth is nourished, and which conveys the nerves which endow it\r\nwith sensation. A traverse section of the same tooth is seen in Fig. 25.\r\n\r\nThe enamel is made of little elongated prisms, all pointing to the\r\ncentre of the tooth. When viewed transversely, their ends are of a\r\nsomewhat hexagonal shape, something like an irregular honeycomb. The\r\ndentine is composed of a substance pierced with myriads of minute\r\ntubes. They require a rather high power--say 300 diameters--to show\r\nthem properly. The cement is found at the root of the fangs, and is\r\nbest shown in the tooth of an aged individual, when it assumes very\r\nclearly the character of bone.\r\n\r\nSections may be made by sawing a slice in the required direction,\r\npolishing one side, and cementing it with old Canada balsam to a slide.\r\nIt may then be filed down to nearly the required thinness, finished by\r\ncarefully rubbing with a hone, and polished with buff leather. Canada\r\nbalsam may then be dropped upon it, and a glass cover pressed firmly\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nSections of young bone form magnificent objects for the polariser.\r\n\r\nFig. 29 is a section cut from one of the palate teeth of the ray\r\n(_Myliobátes_).\r\n\r\nA rather important element in the structure of animals is the “elastic\r\nligament,” which is found in the back of the neck and other parts of\r\nthe body, especially about the spine. It is made of a vast number of\r\nfibres of variable shape and length, branching and communicating,\r\narranged generally in bundles, and remarkable for containing very few\r\nvessels, and no nerves at all. At Fig. 14 may be seen an example of\r\nelastic ligament, popularly called “paxwax,” taken from the neck of a\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThe white fibrous tissue by which all the parts of the body are bound\r\ntogether is seen at Fig. 10; and at Fig. 11 is a beautiful example of\r\nthe “ultimate fibres” of the crystalline lens of a sturgeon’s eye.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of animals are of two kinds, the one termed the striped,\r\nand the other the unstriped. Of these, the latter belongs to organs\r\nwhich work independently of will, such as the stomach, etc., while\r\nthe former belongs to those portions of the body which are subject to\r\nvoluntary motion, such as the arm and the leg. The unstriped muscle\r\nis very simple, consisting merely of long spindle-shaped cells, but\r\nthe striped or voluntary muscle is of more complex construction. Every\r\nvoluntary muscle consists of myriads of tiny fibres, bound together in\r\nlittle bundles, enveloped in a kind of sheath. Fig. 24 is an example of\r\nthis muscular fibre, taken from beef. When soaked in spirit, it often\r\nsplits into a number of discs, the edges of which are marked by the\r\ntransverse lines.\r\n\r\nA fibre of nerve is drawn at Fig. 23, and is given for the purpose of\r\nshowing the manner in which the nerve is contained in and protected\r\nby its sheath, just like a telegraph-wire in its coverings. Just\r\nabove is a transverse section of the same fibre, showing the same\r\narrangement from another point of view, and also illustrating the\r\ncurious phenomenon, that when nerve-fibres are treated with carmine the\r\ncentre takes up the colouring matter, while the sheath remains white as\r\nbefore. The best way of studying nerves is to decapitate a frog, and\r\ncut off a piece of one of the nerves, which, like fine silk threads,\r\ncome out between the joints of the spine inside the abdomen. By careful\r\nteasing out it is easy to obtain preparations showing all the above\r\npoints, and, in addition, the folding-in of the internal sheath which\r\ncorrespond to the insulators of a telegraph-line.\r\n\r\nThe blood of animals is analogous in its office to the sap of plants,\r\nbut differs greatly from it under the microscope. In sap there seem to\r\nbe no microscopic characters, except that when a branch is cut, as in\r\nthe vine, the flowing sap may contain certain substances formed in the\r\nwounded cells, such as chlorophyll, starch, and raphides; but the blood\r\nis known to be an exceedingly complex substance both in a microscopic\r\nand a chemical point of view. When a little fresh blood is placed under\r\nthe microscope, it is seen to consist of a colourless fluid filled with\r\nnumerous little bodies, commonly called “blood-globules,” varying very\r\ngreatly in size and shape, according to the animal from which they\r\nwere taken. Those of the reptiles are very large, as may be seen at\r\nFig. 4, Plate X., which represents a blood corpuscle of the Proteus.\r\nIn this curious reptile the globules are so large that they may be\r\ndistinguished during its life by means of a common pocket lens.\r\n\r\nIn the vertebrated animals these corpuscles are red, and give to the\r\nblood its peculiar tint. They are accompanied by certain colourless\r\ncorpuscles, spherical in form, which are sometimes, as in man, larger\r\nthan the red globules, and in others, as in the siren and the newt,\r\nconsiderably smaller. The general view of the red corpuscles has\r\nsufficient character to enable the practised observer to name the\r\nclass of animal from which it was taken, and in some cases they are\r\nso distinctive that even the genus can be ascertained with tolerable\r\ncertainty. In point of size, the reptiles have the largest and the\r\nmammalia the smallest, those of the Proteus and the musk-deer being\r\nperhaps the most decidedly opposed to each other in this respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Cilia on mussel\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX.]\r\n\r\nIn shape, those of the mammalia are circular discs, mostly with a\r\nconcave centre, though the camel has oval ones; those of the birds are\r\nmore or less oval and convex; those of the reptiles are decidedly oval,\r\nvery thin, and have the nucleus projecting; and those of the fishes are\r\noval and mostly convex. During the process of coagulation the blood\r\ncorpuscles run together into a series of rows, just as if a heap of\r\npence had been piled on each other and then pushed down, so that each\r\npenny overlaps its next neighbour.\r\n\r\nThese objects are illustrated by six examples on Plate X. Fig. 2 is\r\nhuman blood, showing one of the white corpuscles; Fig. 3 is the blood\r\nof the pigeon; Fig. 4, of the _Proteus anguínus_; Fig. 5, of the\r\ntortoise; Fig. 6, of the frog, showing the projecting nucleus; and\r\nFig. 7, of the roach. The blood possesses many curious properties,\r\nwhich cannot be described in these few and simple pages.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of Plate X. is a large circular figure representing\r\nthe membrane of a frog’s foot as seen through the microscope, and\r\nexhibiting the circulation of the blood. The mode of arranging the foot\r\nso as to exhibit the object without hurting the frog is simple enough.\r\n\r\nTake an oblong slip of wood,--my own was made in five minutes out of\r\nthe top of a cigar-box,--bore a hole about an inch in diameter near\r\none end, and cut a number of little slits all round the edge of the\r\nwooden slip. Then get a small linen bag, put the frog into it, and dip\r\nhim into water to keep him comfortable. When he is wanted, pull one of\r\nhis hind feet out of the bag, draw the neck tight enough to prevent\r\nhim from pulling his foot back again, but not sufficiently tight to\r\nstop the circulation. Have a tape fastened to the end of the bag, and\r\ntie it down to the wooden slide. Then fasten a thread to each of his\r\ntoes, bring the foot well over the centre of the hole, stretch the toes\r\nwell apart, and keep them in their places by hitching the threads into\r\nthe notches on the edge of the wooden strip. Perhaps an easier plan\r\nis to secure the threads by drops of sealing-wax when in the desired\r\nposition. Push a glass slide carefully between the foot and the wood,\r\nso as to let the membrane rest upon the glass, and be careful to keep\r\nit well wetted. If the frog kick, as he will most likely do, pass a\r\nthin tape over the middle of the leg, and tie him gently down to the\r\nslide.\r\n\r\nBring the glass into focus, and the foot will present the appearance\r\nso well depicted in the engraving. The veins and arteries are seen\r\nspreading over the whole of the membrane, the larger arteries being\r\noften accompanied by a nerve, as seen in the illustration. Through all\r\nthese channels the blood continually pours with a rather irregular\r\nmotion, caused most probably by the peculiar position of the reptile.\r\nIt is a most wonderful sight, of which the observer is never tired,\r\nand which seems almost more interesting every time that it is beheld.\r\n\r\nThe corpuscles go pushing and jostling one another in the oddest\r\nfashion, just like a British crowd entering an exhibition, each one\r\nseeming to be elbowing its way to the best place. To see them turning\r\nthe corners is very amusing, for they always seem as if they never\r\ncould get round the smaller vessels, and yet invariably accomplish the\r\ntask with perfect ease, turning about and steering themselves as if\r\npossessed of volition, and insinuating their ends when they could not\r\npass crosswise.\r\n\r\nBy putting various substances, such as spirit or salt, upon the\r\nfoot, the rapidity of the circulation at the spot can be greatly\r\nincreased or reduced at will, or even stopped altogether for a while,\r\nand the phenomenon of inflammation and its gradual natural cure be\r\nbeautifully illustrated. The numerous black spots upon the surface are\r\npigment-cells.\r\n\r\nThe tails of young fish also afford excellent objects under the\r\nmicroscope, as the circulation can be seen nearly as well as in the\r\nfrog’s foot. The gills of tadpoles can also be arranged upon the stage\r\nwith a little care, and the same organs in the young of the common newt\r\nwill also exhibit the circulation in a favourable manner. The frog,\r\nhowever, is perhaps the best, as it can be arranged on the “frog-plate”\r\nwithout difficulty, and the creature may be kept for months by placing\r\nit in a cool, damp spot, and feeding it with flies, little slugs, and\r\nsimilar creatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n  Pond-Life--Apparatus and Instructions for Collecting Objects--Methods\r\n  of Examination--Sponge--Infusoria.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all departments of microscopic research the most fascinating and\r\nthe most popular is that which deals with what is known by the generic\r\nname of “pond-life.” The minute forms of the animal creation included\r\nin this term are of such exquisite beauty, and allow the processes of\r\ntheir life-history to be followed with such facility, from the cradle\r\n(when they have one) to the grave (which is very often the body of\r\nanother, larger, organism), that there is none which has attracted\r\nmore observers. Indeed, the first application of the microscope, by\r\nLeeuwenhoek, early in the seventeenth century, was to the observation\r\nof these forms of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Shell of Prawn\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X.]\r\n\r\nA few words may be said, in the first place, as to the outfit. A very\r\nuseful part of it is a walking-stick, to which can be attached either\r\na net for capturing the larger forms of life, or a hook for collecting\r\nthe weeds, to which many forms of great interest and beauty are\r\nattached (Fig. 15). The stick is telescopic, and can also have attached\r\nto it a bottle, which, put into the water at any desired spot,--say,\r\namongst a clump of weeds, or near the bottom, upside down, and then\r\nsuddenly reversed,--will bring away samples of the inhabitants of the\r\nneighbourhood. When these are sparsely distributed through the water,\r\nthe latter may be concentrated by the use of a bottle round the neck of\r\nwhich is firmly tied a coarse calico bag, funnel-shaped, and supported\r\nby a wire ring, somewhat as shown in the illustration. Muslin is,\r\nhowever, too coarse for many organisms. This net is immersed in the\r\nwater so that the ring is just above the surface, and one bottleful\r\nafter another poured through. The water strains off, the organisms are\r\nleft behind. The immersion is necessary to reduce the pressure to which\r\ndelicate organisms would otherwise be subjected. When the bottle is\r\nfull, or sufficiently concentrated as to its contents, the latter are\r\npoured into one of the ordinary collecting-bottles, of which half a\r\ndozen at least should always be taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nOn reaching home, and as often as possible on the way, the corks should\r\nbe removed, as these organisms soon use up the air in the water.\r\n\r\nFor examination a glass trough of considerable size, say three inches\r\nin length, half an inch in depth, and two inches in height, should be\r\nhalf filled with the water, and examined with the pocket magnifier.\r\nWith a little practice it will be found easy to take up not only\r\nthe larger organisms, but even very minute ones, with one of the\r\ndipping-tubes with a long tapering point already referred to. The\r\norganism, when “spotted,” is followed by eye and tube, the finger\r\nbeing held over the mouth of the latter, and at the critical moment\r\nthe finger is removed, and the organism swept into the tube by the\r\nin-rushing water. Now wipe off the excess with a clean handkerchief,\r\n“spot” the organism in the tube again, and carefully absorb the\r\nsuperfluous water with a piece of blotting paper; and finally, gently\r\nbut sharply blow the remainder on to the plate of the live-box, put on\r\nthe cover, and examine with a one-inch power. If, as often happens,\r\nthe organism sticks to the side of the tube, a little more water must\r\nbe drawn in, and the process repeated. The use of the cotton-wool trap\r\nspoken of previously will often be very helpful in the examination of\r\nactively moving organisms.\r\n\r\nIn the case of weeds, a small portion should be placed in the trough\r\nand carefully examined from end to end, first with the pocket lens and\r\nthen with the one-inch power. Let us now consider the objects most\r\nlikely to be met with.\r\n\r\nA piece of stick may be coated with a white layer, feeling rough to the\r\ntouch, and full of small holes. The chances are that this will be a\r\npiece of fresh-water sponge, _Spongilla fluviatílis_, and by dark-field\r\nillumination particles may be seen to enter at some orifices and be\r\nejected at others. With a very high power and a very thin section,\r\nproperly prepared, these holes will be seen to be the mouths of\r\nchannels which are lined by the most delicate organisms possible, each\r\nhaving a minute body crowned with a tiny crystal cup, in the middle of\r\nwhich is a long cilium, or flagellum, as it is here called (Plate XIII.\r\nFig. 1). The currents are produced by the combined action of these\r\nflagella. In point of fact, the sponge is a colony of minute animals\r\nworking harmoniously for the common good. If the specimen be found in\r\nwinter the sponge will be full of tiny balls, the “gemmules” of the\r\nnext season’s growth. The roughness is due to the flinty spicules,\r\nwhich are at once the scaffolding and the protection of the sponge, and\r\nby boiling the sponge in a mixture of nitric acid and water (half and\r\nhalf) these spicules will be set free, and may be washed, allowed to\r\nsettle, washed again, dried, and mounted in balsam. The gemmules are\r\ncoated by very beautiful spicules, consisting of two wheels connected\r\nby a rod. These may be treated in the same way. The life-history of the\r\ncommon sponge is as yet but imperfectly known.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lowest form of life is the _Amœba_, shown in Plate IX.\r\nFig. 1, a mere lump of jelly, which flows along, and when it comes\r\ninto contact with any likely subject for digestion flows round it,\r\nencloses it, absorbs what it can from it, and leaves it behind. A near\r\nrelative of the Amœba is the _Arcella_ (Fig. 2), which is simply an\r\nAmœba with a shell. Being unable to swim, these organisms are naturally\r\nto be most often found at the bottom of the collecting bottle, and\r\nit is always advisable to take up a portion of the débris with a\r\ndipping tube, which is then held upright on a slide with the finger\r\nupon it until the dirt settles on to the slide, when it is removed,\r\na cover-glass put upon the dirt, and a quarter-inch power used for\r\nexamination. Many forms will be discovered in this way which would\r\notherwise escape observation.\r\n\r\nAnother curious organism, of great size (comparatively) and extreme\r\nbeauty, is the sun animalcule (_Actínophrys_), which has a round body\r\nand long tentacles (Fig. 3), to which free-swimming organisms adhere,\r\nand by the combined action of the neighbouring ones are drawn to the\r\nbody and received into it; one cannot say swallowed.\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate IX., shows the curious arithmetical process whereby\r\nthe Infusoria multiply by division, a groove appearing at one point,\r\nrapidly deepening, and finally separating the animal completely into\r\ntwo. The species is the _Chílodon_, a flattened creature, ciliated all\r\nover, having a set of teeth arranged in the form of a tube, and at its\r\nfore-part a kind of membranous lip. A similar phenomenon, in an earlier\r\nstage, is shown in Fig. 26, Plate XIII., the organism in this case\r\nbeing _Euplótes_.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that sponges are colonies of extremely minute\r\norganisms, each furnished with a membranous collar or funnel, the whole\r\nlooking like an exquisite wine-glass without a foot. These organisms\r\nare not always grouped in colonies, however. Many are free-growing,\r\nand may be found attached to the stems of water-plants, but they are\r\nextremely minute, and will hardly be noticed until the microscopist\r\nhas acquired considerable experience, nor even then--with such an\r\ninstrument as we have postulated--will he see more than a tiny pear,\r\nwith a straight line, the margin of the cup, on each side of its\r\nsummit. The flagellum will be quite invisible.\r\n\r\nSome similar organisms may, nevertheless, be found which, though\r\nstill minute, are within the range of a properly managed quarter-inch\r\nobjective. Such an one, of extreme beauty, is the _Dinobrýon_ shown in\r\nPlate XIII. Fig. 3. Each “zoöid,” as the separate animals are called,\r\namong the Infusoria, or each generation of zoöids, stands upon its\r\nparent and has two flagella. When alarmed, the zoöid sinks to the\r\nbottom of its cell, and withdraws its flagella. In Fig. 2 (_Eugléna_)\r\nwe have a similar zoöid, but of far greater size, and free-swimming.\r\nIt is a very common object, and possesses a red eye-speck close to the\r\n“contractile vesicle.” All Infusoria have the latter, some a great\r\nnumber, as in Fig. 9. The vesicle contracts at regular intervals, and\r\nis then simply blotted out, but reforms in the same place, so that it\r\nis probably the heart or the urinary bladder of these minute animals.\r\n\r\nThe lovely rosette shown in Fig. 4 is the _Synura_, a spherical colony\r\nof zoöids, each of which has two flagella, and is in addition clothed\r\nwith rows of cilia. A beautiful sight it is to watch these colonies\r\nrolling through the field of view. Not uncommon, especially in brackish\r\nwater, is the _Peridinium_ (Fig. 5), with its plate armour, long\r\nflagellum, and girdle of cilia. A gigantic species of the same family\r\nis common in sea-water, and will be easily recognised by its body, not\r\nmuch larger than that of Peridinium, being furnished with three long\r\narms, curiously bent. It is called _Ceratium_, and is sometimes present\r\nin such abundance as to thicken the water, near the surface of which it\r\nswims.\r\n\r\nWe now come to a class of Infusoria which is characterised by the\r\npossession of a complete covering of cilia, arranged in rows all over\r\nthe body. The number of these is enormous; we can only glance at a\r\nfew types, by mastering which the observer will, at all events, know\r\nwhereabouts he is. The first we will take is the _Coleps_ (Fig. 6),\r\na very common kind, whose body is marked by a series of geometrical\r\nlines, so that the organism looks very much like an elongated\r\ngeographical globe. These markings are on the tunic, which is of a\r\nbrownish colour. Very different is the _Trachelocerca_ (Fig. 7), with\r\nits long flexible neck, which is in constant movement from side to side\r\nas the creature swims along. As seen in the figure, the neck is clear\r\nand the head has a fringe of longer cilia.\r\n\r\nThe _Trachelius_ (Fig. 8) is perhaps the largest of all the Infusoria,\r\nbeing readily visible to even an inexperienced eye. Its body is richly\r\nfurnished with contractile vesicles, and the protoplasm is curiously\r\nreticulated. We may here remark that the Trachelius is especially\r\nprompt in doing what most of these organisms do when put under pressure\r\nin a live-box, namely, in performing a kind of _harakiri_. The outline\r\nfirst becomes irregular, then the body rapidly swells and finally comes\r\nto pieces, the fragments dancing mockingly away under the influence of\r\ntheir still-moving cilia. The remedy is to use the cotton-wool trap and\r\nthe lightest possible pressure.\r\n\r\nA very elegant organism is shown in the bottom right-hand corner of the\r\nPlate (Fig. 25). It is the _Loxophyllum_, and has a strongly marked\r\ncontractile vesicle.\r\n\r\nAnother large form is _Amphileptus_ (Fig. 9), already referred to as\r\nhaving a large number of contractile vesicles arranged in a regular\r\nrow; and more massive still is _Bursaria_ (Fig. 10), a very curious\r\norganism, very much like a purse indeed, and possessing a wonderful\r\narrangement of cilia inside the funnel. These are arranged like a\r\nladder, a series of rows of short stiff cilia, which move at short\r\nintervals in unison, and tend to sweep down into the cavity any\r\nsmall particles of food. This arrangement is here described for the\r\nfirst time, and appears to be quite unlike anything else among the\r\nInfusoria. Not unlike Bursaria, but having no ladder, and being\r\nfurnished with a delicate membranous pouch in front of the slit of the\r\npurse, is _Condylostoma_, which we shrewdly suspect to be the young\r\nform of Bursaria. This is a point which requires elucidation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful of all these forms is shown in Fig. 11,\r\n_Folliculina_, a type of a large group characterised by the possession\r\nof a transparent case, of extremely elegant form, within which the\r\nanimal retreats on the slightest alarm.\r\n\r\nFearless and independent, as becomes its size, is the trumpet-shaped\r\n_Stentor_ (Fig. 12), which may easily be seen when present, as it is in\r\nalmost every good gathering of water-weed. The particular form drawn\r\n(_S. Mülleri_) does not make a case, but many members of the genus\r\ndo, and it is very common to see a stem almost covered with them.\r\nSuch a sight, once seen under dark-field illumination, will never be\r\nforgotten. The method of multiplication of the Stentors (by division)\r\nis extremely easy to watch, and very instructive.\r\n\r\nA curious organism is _Trichodina_ (Fig. 13), which, though a\r\nfree-swimmer, is always parasitic upon the body of some higher animal.\r\nWe have found it sometimes upon Hydra, and always in hundreds upon the\r\nstickleback. The next group of Infusoria is distinguished by the body’s\r\nbeing only ciliated at particular points, usually round the mouth, or\r\nwhat acts as such. The first form is Vorticella (Fig. 14), a beautiful\r\nvase-like creature upon a stem. Down the stem runs a muscular fibre,\r\nand on the least shock the fibre contracts and draws the stem into a\r\nbeautiful spiral, whilst the cilia are drawn in, and the zoöid assumes\r\nthe appearance of a ball at the end of a watch-spring. An exquisite\r\nsight is a colony of Vorticellæ, for these actions are always going on,\r\nas, for example, when one member of the family touches another, which\r\nis quite sufficient to provoke the contraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nPOLARIZED LIGHT.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Tooth of Echinus\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XI.]\r\n\r\nMany compound tree-like forms of Vorticella are known, one of which,\r\n_Carchesium_ (Fig. 15), may serve as a type of all. In the case of this\r\norganism, the colony contracts in sections on a moderate shock; in the\r\nsecond, _Zoothamnium_, as a whole; whilst in _Epistylis_ the stalks are\r\nrigid, and the individuals contract singly. When the shock is violent,\r\nthe appearance presented by the two former is that shown in Fig. 16. In\r\nall three cases the colonies are usually so large that they are visible\r\nas trees to the naked eye, and some members of the group are extremely\r\ncommon. Moreover, they are often parasitic, as, for example, upon\r\nCyclops, which is frequently loaded with them.\r\n\r\nAnother compound form is _Ophrydium_, a colony of which (not unusually\r\nlarge) is shown of the natural size in Fig. 18, with a single zoöid,\r\nmagnified, by the side of it, in Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have an exquisite group of organisms related to Vorticella,\r\nbut possessing a transparent envelope, the forms of which are most\r\nvaried, but always graceful. _Vaginicola_ (Fig. 17) is a good example\r\nof this, and _Cothurnia_ (Fig. 20) still more so. Many of these\r\norganisms, too, are furnished with a plate, attached either to the\r\nhead or to the body, which plate, when they withdraw into their cases,\r\ncloses the latter perfectly, as in the case of the exquisite _Pyxicola_\r\n(Fig. 21).\r\n\r\nA very interesting but singularly obtrusive organism is the\r\n_Stylonychia_ (Figs. 22, 23). How often has it happened to us to have\r\nan interesting object nicely in the field of view, and then to have it\r\nknocked out of sight by the blundering incursion of this burly fellow,\r\nwho runs so rapidly by means of his “styles” that he gives nothing\r\ntime to get out of the way. He is of interest to us, however, as the\r\nrepresentative of a class in which the body is not ciliated, or very\r\npartially and slightly so, usually round the mouth. We have frequently\r\nfound Stylonychia, in company with Vorticella and _Paramœcium_ (Plate\r\nIX. Fig. 6), in the water in which flowers have been standing for a few\r\ndays; sometimes the numbers are so great as to make the water quite\r\nmilky.\r\n\r\nOne more form must conclude this short sketch of the great Infusorial\r\nfamily. It is the _Acineta_ (Fig. 24), which, attached by its\r\nfoot-stalk, and devoid of cilia, patiently waits, with outspread arms,\r\nto receive and embrace smaller members of the family as they dance\r\nmerrily about. Alas! its embrace is as fatal as that of the image of\r\nthe Virgin which bore beneath its robe spikes and daggers, for the\r\nvictim struggles vainly to escape, and the nourishment from its body is\r\nrapidly absorbed.\r\n\r\nAnd here we take our leave of a group which, simple as is the\r\nconstruction of the animals which it includes (for every one, great\r\nand small alike, is composed of a single cell), is yet full of beauty\r\nand interest. He who wishes to pursue the matter further will find in\r\nSaville Kent’s _Manual of the Infusoria_ a perfect mine of information,\r\nto which we gladly acknowledge our indebtedness, both now and in time\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n  Fresh-water Worms--Planarians--Hydra--Polyzoa--Rotifers--Chætonotus--\r\n  Water-Bears.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water worms form a large and well-defined group, and a few\r\nwords regarding them may be useful.\r\n\r\nThey are very common, and very difficult to find information about,\r\nmost of the work relating to them having been done in Germany. At the\r\nsame time, they are so highly organised and so transparent that the\r\nprocess of their life-history may be easily followed.\r\n\r\nOne large group has the peculiarity of multiplying by division, the\r\nlast joints or segments being devoted to the formation of the new\r\nindividual. At one time of the year the ordinary sexual process of\r\nreproduction takes the place of this method, and each worm is then\r\nsurrounded by a belt such as may be seen in the common earthworm under\r\nsimilar conditions. Further information on this subject is greatly\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nThe type is the common _Naïs_, which has a body of thirty segments or\r\nmore, two eye-specks on the head, and a double row of bristles along\r\nthe back; whilst below, each segment carries strong hooked bristles,\r\nnearly buried in the body, by means of which the worm crawls. Inside\r\nthe mouth is a large proboscis, which can be protruded, and this leads\r\ninto a stomach which is merely an enlargement of the intestine which\r\nsucceeds it. The circulation of the blood (which is colourless) can be\r\neasily watched. It begins at the tail with a contraction of the dorsal\r\nvessel, passes up to the head, and then down below the intestine to the\r\ntail again. The intestine is ciliated inside, and it is by a current\r\nof water carried into the intestine by these cilia that the blood is\r\naërated.\r\n\r\nIn the next genus, _Dero_, this is clearly seen, for the tail (Plate\r\nXIV. Fig. 1) is opened out into a wide shield, from which rise four,\r\nsix, or even eight finger-like processes. These parts are all ciliated,\r\nand contain a network of blood-vessels. The worm lives in a case which\r\nit builds in the mud, and the way to find it is to put some of the mud\r\ninto a glass beaker with water, and allow it to stand. If there be\r\nmembers of this family in it, their tails will be seen protruding above\r\nthe water. Pour out the mud sharply, fill up with water, and allow the\r\ndirt to subside, and the worms may then be made to leave their cases by\r\npressure by a camel hair pencil on the lower end of the tube, and may\r\nbe caught with the dipping tube and placed in the live-box. They have\r\nno eyes, otherwise the general outline of the body closely resembles\r\nthat of Naïs.\r\n\r\n_Slavína_ (Fig. 2) has a row of touch-organs, like pimples, round\r\neach segment, and is a dirty looking creature, with an inordinately\r\nlong first pair of bristles, but this reaches its acme in _Pristina_\r\n(Fig. 3) (sometimes, though wrongly, called _Stylaria_) _parasita_,\r\nwhich has three long sets of bristles upon the back, and keeps these in\r\nconstant wing-like motion. The true _Stylaria_ has a long trunk, set\r\nright in the head, and tubular (Fig. 6); it grows to a considerable\r\nlength, and when in the stage of fission it is very funny to see\r\nthe two proboscides waving about, one on the middle, as well as the\r\noriginal one at the head. There is also a form with a shorter proboscis\r\nof the same kind.\r\n\r\n_Bohemilla_ has a tremendous array of saw-like bristles upon the back,\r\nwhilst _Chætogaster_ has none at all in this position, and few below.\r\n_Æolosoma_ has merely tufts of hair instead of bristles, and swims\r\nfreely. It is easily recognised by the red, yellow, or green pigment\r\nspots in its skin, and by the ciliated head. Rarest of all the family\r\nis the one which connects it with the ordinary _Tubifex_, the red worm\r\nwhich lives in masses in the mud of brooks and ponds, the waving tails\r\nprotruding above the water, and being instantly withdrawn when a foot\r\nis stamped upon the bank. Their Naid cousin is _Naidium_, and has red\r\nblood, but multiplies by fission, which Tubifex does not.\r\n\r\nAnother group of worms is the _Planarians_, small leech-like worms,\r\nblack, white, or brown, which are rarely absent from a gathering. The\r\nwould-be investigator will find in them an abundant field for work, as\r\nthey are but very imperfectly known or studied.\r\n\r\nThe great enemy of all these worms is the _Hydra_, a good idea of\r\nwhich may be formed from Plate IX. Fig. 13. There are three species,\r\nall of which are fairly common. They capture their prey in exactly the\r\nsame way as sea-anemones and the marine hydroid forms, so numerous and\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\nNor must we omit to notice the exquisitely beautiful Polyzoa, such\r\nas _Lophopus_ (Plate XIV. Fig. 4), with its ciliated tentacles and\r\ntransparent social home; _Fredericella_ (Fig. 5), with its graceful\r\nstems, and their still more graceful inhabitants; and the wonderful\r\n_Cristatella_, whose colonies form bodies which crawl over the stems\r\nof water plants. But for grace, beauty, and variety, the Rotifers\r\nassuredly outshine all their fellow inhabitants of our ponds and\r\nstreams.\r\n\r\nWe can only take a few types, and of all these the most common is the\r\ncommon Rotifer (Plate IX. Fig. 10). It is there shown in the act of\r\nswimming, but it can withdraw its “wheels” and creep like a leech,\r\nprotruding its foot as it does so. It is distinguished by the two\r\neye-spots on the proboscis from _Philodina_, in which they are on the\r\nbreast, and _Callidina_, which has none. When at ease in its mind, the\r\nanimal protrudes its wheels, and by their action draws in particles\r\nof food, these passing down to the incessantly moving jaws, which act\r\nlike a mill and crush the food before it passes on to be digested. The\r\nmovement of the jaws may even be seen in the young Rotifer whilst still\r\nin the egg within the body of the parent, and as the egg reaches its\r\nfull development other eggs again are visible within it, so that we may\r\nhave three generations in one individual. The males of most of the\r\nRotifera are unknown. Those that are known are very lowly organised,\r\nhaving only the ciliary wreath and the reproductive organs, and are\r\nonly found at certain seasons of the year. For the remainder of the\r\ntime parthenogenesis is the rule, just as among the Aphides. We select\r\na few individuals for illustration as types. Those who wish to pursue\r\nthis study further must be referred to the monumental work of Hudson\r\nand Gosse.\r\n\r\nThe common Rotifer, already referred to, may be taken as the type\r\nof the Bdelloida, or leech-like class, so called from their mode of\r\n“looping” themselves along. The group is a comparatively small one in\r\ncomparison with the next, the Ploïma, or free-swimmers. We can only\r\nselect from the vast variety a few species, first of those classed\r\nas illoricated, from their being without a _loríca_, or case, and\r\nthen of the loricated, which possess it. A very large and common\r\nform is _Hydátina_ (Plate XIV. Fig. 7), which lives by choice in the\r\nreddish pools of water found often by the roadside. It shows the whole\r\norganisation of the class magnificently; the ciliary wreath on the\r\nhead, with the striped muscles which draw the latter back, the powerful\r\njaws, the digestive canal with its crop and intestine, the ovary\r\nwith the developing eggs, the water-vascular system with the curious\r\nvibratile tags, and finally, the cloaca, which receives the waste of\r\nthe body and expels it at intervals.\r\n\r\nAnother form, also common, especially in clear water, is _Synchæta_\r\n(Fig. 8), very much like a kite or peg-top in shape, which has the\r\npower of attaching itself by a glutinous thread, and spinning round at\r\na tremendous rate. Then there is the gigantic _Asplanchna_ (Fig. 9),\r\nwhich has no opening below, so that the waste must be discharged by the\r\nmouth; and curious _Sacculus_, which gorges itself with chlorophyll\r\nuntil it looks like a green bag with a string round it, but clear and\r\nsparkling. Of the _Notommatæ_ there is a whole host, but we can only\r\nmention the beautiful _N. Aurita_ (Fig. 10), with an eye of a beautiful\r\nviolet colour, composed of several spherules massed together, and two\r\ncurious ear-like processes on the head, from which it takes its name.\r\nSome of the Ploïma have powers of leaping which must be noticed. The\r\n_Triarthra_ (Fig. 11) has three arms, or what we may call such, which\r\nit can stretch out suddenly and leap to a considerable distance, whilst\r\nin _Polyarthra_ the arms become a whole cluster of broad saw-like\r\nbristles.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to note a few species of the mail-clad or loricated\r\nRotifers, chief among which the great _Euchlanis_ (Fig. 12), a\r\nnoble-looking fellow, calls for our attention, his great size rendering\r\nhim easily visible to the naked eye. It is difficult to avoid using the\r\nmasculine gender, but, of course, all those figured and described are\r\nof the gentler sex. _Salpina_, too (Fig. 14), with its box-like lorica,\r\narmed with spines at each of the upper angles, and having three below,\r\nis quite easily recognised, and very common. _Brachionus_ (Fig. 13)\r\nhas a shield-shaped case, well furnished with spines, symmetrically\r\narranged at the top, and an opening below for the flexible wrinkled\r\ntail, like the trunk of an elephant. _Pterodina_ (Fig. 15) has a\r\nsimilar tail, but a round case, and the head is much more like that\r\nof the common Rotifer when extended. _Anuræa_ (Fig. 16), on the other\r\nhand, has no tail, and its case is shaped like a butcher’s tray, with\r\na handle at each corner. _Dinocharis_ (Fig. 17) has a roof-like case,\r\nwith long spines on the root of the tail, and a forked stiff foot.\r\n_Noteus_ (Fig. 18) is much like Pterodina, except in its foot, which\r\nmore nearly resembles that of Dinocharis.\r\n\r\nThe list might be indefinitely extended, but sufficient has probably\r\nbeen said to enable the tyro to find his bearings in this large,\r\nbeautiful, and interesting class.\r\n\r\nWe pass on to notice in conclusion two or three of the fixed forms,\r\nof which a beautiful example is the _Melicerta ringens_ (Plate IX.\r\nFig. 7), whose building operations have a never-ending charm. Particles\r\nof débris are accumulated in a curious little cavity in the chin, in\r\nwhich they are whirled round, and mixed with a secretion which binds\r\nthem together, and when a brick is made the head is bent down and the\r\nbrick applied to the desired spot with mathematical regularity. By\r\nsupplying fine particles of innocuous colouring matters, the Melicerta\r\nmay be made to build a variegated case. The most remarkable specimen\r\nknown is the one figured in Hudson and Gosse’s work, which was found\r\nby the present writer in a specimen of water from which he had already\r\nobtained five-and-twenty species of various kinds of Rotifer; the water\r\nwas collected by an inexperienced person, and there was only a pint\r\nof it. It had, moreover, been kept for three weeks, and the moral of\r\nthat is, to preserve one’s gatherings, and keep an aquarium into which\r\nthey may be poured when done with for the moment. New forms will often\r\ndevelop with startling rapidity, their eggs having been present in the\r\noriginal gathering. The young form of Melicerta, shown in Plate XIV.\r\nFig. 20, is strangely unlike its mother, and much more nearly resembles\r\nits father.\r\n\r\nAnother group of extreme beauty is the Flosculariæ (Fig. 19), several\r\nspecies of which are very common. They will be easily known by their\r\nappearance, which resembles a shaving brush when closed; whilst, when\r\nopening, the shaving brush resembles a cloud of delicate shimmering\r\nthreads, which at last stand out straight, radiating all round the head\r\nof the creature, and forming the trap by means of which it catches its\r\nprey. Finally, there is the lovely _Stephanoceros_ (not, unfortunately,\r\nvery common), with its five symmetrically placed and gracefully curved\r\narms, perhaps the most lovely of all Rotifers, with its exquisitely\r\ntransparent body, sparkling with masses of green and golden brown.\r\nHe who finds this has a treasure indeed, and will be encouraged to\r\nprosecute his studies in this “Fairyland of Microscopy.”\r\n\r\nTwo irregular forms call for a word of remark. The first is\r\n_Chætonotus_ (Plate XIII. Fig. 27), which stands on the borderland of\r\nthe Infusoria and the Rotifers, neglected as a rule by the students\r\nof both; and the second the _Tardigrada_ (Plate XIV. Fig. 21), or\r\nwater-bears, which have feet like those of the red wriggling larva of\r\n_Chironomus_, whose silky tubes are common enough on submerged walls\r\nand on the stems of plants, these feet consisting of a mass of radially\r\narranged hooklets, which can be protruded or withdrawn at will; whilst\r\nthe head of the water-bear is far more like that of a louse, pointed\r\nand hard, and suited for burrowing about, as the animal does, among the\r\nrubbish at the bottom of the bottle. Both the genera just referred to\r\nwill repay careful study, as little is known of their life-history or\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nA few words must be devoted, in conclusion, to the Entomostraca,\r\nthose shrimp-like animals which, like their marine relatives, act as\r\nscavengers to the community. Fig. 22 is a portrait of _Cypris_, a not\r\nvery handsome form, but one very commonly found. Its shell is opaque,\r\nso that the internal organs are difficult to observe. Far different\r\nin this respect is the beautiful _Daphnia_, the water-flea _par\r\nexcellence_, whose carapace is of crystalline clearness, so that every\r\nmovement of every one of the internal organs may be followed with the\r\ngreatest facility. There are many species of the genus, and some of\r\nthem are very common, so that the opportunity of examining these lovely\r\nobjects is easily obtained. Plate XIV. Fig. 23, shows the most common\r\nof all the class under notice, the _Cyclops_, so named from the fact\r\nthat, like the fabled giants of classical literature, it has a single\r\neye in the middle of its forehead. It is often loaded with Infusoria,\r\nespecially Vorticella and Epistylis, already described, to such an\r\nextent that its movements are greatly hampered.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

The most\r\ncurious of all are those which earn a dishonest and lazy living by\r\nattaching themselves to the bodies of other and larger animals, chiefly\r\nfish. One of the largest is the _Argulus_, the bane of aquarium\r\nkeepers, which is of considerable size, and attacks gold-fish, and in\r\nfact almost any fish to which it can obtain access.\r\n\r\nThe gills of the stickleback will furnish examples of the curious\r\n_Ergasilus_, which consists chiefly of an enormous pair of hooks and\r\ntwo long egg-bags, the latter, in varying form, being carried by many\r\nof the Entomostraca.\r\n\r\nUpon the fins of the same fish will be found the remarkable\r\n_Gyrodactylus_, a worm-like animal which attaches itself by a large\r\numbrella-like foot, in the centre of which are two huge claws. The\r\nhead is split down the middle for some distance. We may mention, in\r\nconcluding our notice of the external and involuntary guests of the\r\nunlucky stickleback, that its skin is usually frequented by hosts\r\nof the Trichodina described in the last chapter. Of the internal\r\nparasites, want of space forbids us to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n  Marine Life--Sponges--Infusoria--Foraminifera--Radiolaria--Hydroid\r\n  Zoophytes--Polyzoa--Worms--Lingual Ribbons and Gills of\r\n  Mollusca--Star-Fishes and Sea-Urchins--Cuttle-Fish--\r\n  Corallines--Miscellaneous Objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as is the range of objects presented to the student of\r\nfresh-water life, the latter field is limited indeed as compared with\r\nthat afforded by the sea. The Infusoria and Rotifers furnished by the\r\nlatter are, indeed, much fewer in number and variety, but the vast host\r\nof sponges, polyzoa, hydroids, crustacea, molluscs, ascidians, and\r\nworms, to say nothing of the wealth of vegetable life, renders the sea\r\nthe happy hunting-ground of the microscopist.\r\n\r\nWhether it be along the edge of the water, as the tide retreats,\r\nespecially after a gale; or in the rock-pools; or, perhaps best of\r\nall, upon those portions of the shore left uncovered only by the\r\nlowest spring-tides, the harvest is simply inexhaustible. Stones\r\nturned up will exhibit a world in miniature. Encrusted with green or\r\npink sponges, or with gelatinous masses of ascidians, fringed at its\r\nedges with hydroids, coated above with polyzoa, a single one will\r\noften supply more work than could be got through in a week of steady\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nA description of the fresh-water sponge already given may serve very\r\nwell to indicate the general outlines of the organisation of the marine\r\nones too. The spicules of the latter are, however, not always flinty;\r\nvery often, as in the case of _Grantia_ (Plate IX. Figs. 8 and 14),\r\nthey are calcareous, a point which can be settled by the application of\r\na little nitric acid and water. If lime be present there will be strong\r\neffervescence, and the separation of the spicules can only be effected\r\nby gently warming a portion of the sponge in caustic potash solution,\r\npouring the resulting mass into water, and allowing the spicules to\r\nsettle. The washing and settling must be repeated several times, and a\r\nportion of the deposit may then be taken up with a dipping-tube, spread\r\nupon a slide and dried, and then covered in balsam solution. The forms\r\nare endless, and the same sponge will often supply three or four, or\r\neven more. Among them may be seen accurate likenesses of pins, needles,\r\nmarlin-spikes, cucumbers, grappling-hooks, fish-hooks, porters’-hooks,\r\ncalthrops, knife-rests, fish-spears, barbed arrows, spiked globes,\r\nwar-clubs, boomerangs, life-preservers, and many other indescribable\r\nforms. The flinty forms must be prepared by boiling, as described in\r\nspeaking of the mounting of diatoms in Chapter XI., except that, of\r\ncourse, only one settlement is required after thorough washing.\r\n\r\nEvery one who has been by or on the sea on a fine summer night must\r\nhave noticed the bright flashes of light that appear whenever its\r\nsurface is disturbed; the wake of a boat, for example, leaving a\r\nluminous track as far as the eye can reach. This phosphorescence is\r\ncaused by many animals resident in the sea, but chiefly by the little\r\ncreature represented at Fig. 9, the _Noctilúca_, myriads of which may\r\nbe found in a pail of water dipped at random from the glowing waves. A\r\ntooth of this creature more magnified is shown immediately above.\r\n\r\nA large group of microscopic organisms is known to zoologists under\r\nthe name of Foraminifera, on account of the numerous holes in their\r\nbeautiful shells, most of which are composed of carbonate of lime,\r\nthough some are horny and others are composed of aggregations of minute\r\ngrains of sand, the forms in one class often closely imitating those in\r\nanother. It is of the shells of these minute animals that the “white\r\ncliffs of old England” are very largely composed, and those who desire\r\nto understand the part which these tiny creatures have played, and are\r\nplaying, in geology, will do well to study Huxley’s fascinating essay\r\non “A Piece of Chalk.”\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Chætonotus larus\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIII.]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these shells are Amœbæ, mere masses of jelly,\r\nand some forms may be found sliding over the weeds in almost every\r\nrock-pool. The anchor-mud, already spoken of, always contains some,\r\nand many forms may be found in the sand from sponges, which should be\r\npassed through a series of wire sieves, of increasing fineness, and\r\nthe residuum in each case be examined dry under a one-inch power. The\r\nshells may be picked up with a needle which has been slightly greased\r\nby being passed over the hair, and they may be mounted by sticking them\r\nto the slide with thin starch paste, putting on a cover-glass properly\r\nsupported, and then running turpentine under the cover-glass, heating\r\nto expel the air, and finally filling up with balsam. Or, as opaque\r\nobjects, they may be mounted in a cell dry. The forms are endless, but\r\nall are beautiful, and a few examples are given in Plate IX. Fig. 4\r\n(_Miliolína_), and Plate XII. Fig. 7, which is a portion of the shell\r\nto show the holes, Fig. 13 (_Polystomella_), Fig. 14 (_Truncatulína_),\r\nFig. 15 (_Polymorphína_), Fig. 16 (_Miliolína_, partly fossilised),\r\nFig. 18 (_Lagéna_). and Fig. 20 (_Biloculína_).\r\n\r\nAllied to these are the lovely Radiolaria, whose shells, constructed\r\non a similar plan, are composed of flint. They are found in remarkable\r\nprofusion in the deposit from Cambridge, Barbados, but also in a\r\nliving state at even enormous depths in the ocean. The present writer\r\nhas obtained many forms from _Challenger_ soundings, and the great\r\nauthority on this subject is Haeckel’s report in the official accounts\r\nof the expedition of the above-named vessel.\r\n\r\nThe Hydroid Zoophytes are represented by several examples. These\r\ncreatures are soft and almost gelatinous, and are furnished with\r\ntentacles or lobes by which they can catch and retain their prey.\r\nIn order to support their tender structure they are endowed with a\r\nhorny skeleton, sometimes outside and sometimes inside them, which is\r\ncalled the polypidom. They are very common on our coasts, where they\r\nmay be found thrown on the shore, or may be dredged up from the deeper\r\nportions of the sea.\r\n\r\nFig. 13 is a portion of one of the commonest genera, _Sertularia_,\r\nshowing one of the inhabitants projecting its tentacles from its\r\ndomicile. Fig. 15 is the same species, given to show the egg-cells.\r\nThis, as well as other zoophytes, is generally classed among the\r\nsea-weeds in the shops that throng all watering-places.\r\n\r\nThe form just referred to is a near relative of the Hydra, already\r\ndescribed, and belongs to the same great family as the sea-anemones.\r\nOne form, shown in Fig. 26, is the _Hydra Tuba_, long thought to be a\r\ndistinct animal, but now known to be the young form of a jelly-fish,\r\nor Medusa. The Hydra Tuba throws off joints at intervals, each of\r\nwhich becomes a perfect jelly-fish. One of them is shown in Fig. 27.\r\nFig. 28 represents a very small and pretty Medusa, the Thaumantias.\r\nWhen this animal is touched or startled, each of the purple globules\r\nround the edge flashes into light, producing a most beautiful and\r\nsingular appearance. Fig. 29 exhibits the so-called compound eye of\r\nanother species of Medusa, though it would appear that these are really\r\nconnected with the nervous system of the animal, and have to do with\r\nthe pulsating contractions of the bell by which it is propelled through\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nIn my _Common Objects of the Sea-Shore_ the Actíniæ, or Sea-Anemones,\r\nare treated of at some length. At Fig. 16 is shown part of a tentacle\r\nflinging out the poison-darts by which it secures its prey; and Fig. 17\r\nis a more magnified view of one of these darts and its case.\r\n\r\nMuch more might be said under this head, but we must pass on to another\r\ngroup, which, whilst possessing a certain general resemblance to the\r\nhydroid zoophytes, differs utterly from them in internal organisation.\r\nWe have already referred to the fresh-water polyzoa. The marine forms\r\nare vastly more numerous, and more easily found, since not only\r\npieces of weed upon which they grow are to be found upon every beach,\r\nbut whole masses of leaf-like colonies, forming what is known as\r\nhorn-wrack, may be plentifully found. Instead of the tentacles armed\r\nwith sting-cells, like the anemone’s, possessed by the Hydrozoa, the\r\nPolyzoa have arms clothed with active cilia, by which the food is swept\r\ninto the mouth, passing on into the stomach, and then through the\r\nintestine to another opening.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 is a very curious zoophyte called _Anguinaria_, or snake-head,\r\non account of its shape, the end of the polypidom resembling the head\r\nof the snake, and the tentacles looking like its tongue as they are\r\nthrust forward and rapidly withdrawn. Fig. 21 is the same creature\r\non an enlarged scale, and just below is one of its tentacles still\r\nmore magnified. Fig. 23 is the ladies’-slipper zoophyte (_Eretea_);\r\nand Fig. 24 is called the tobacco-pipe or shepherd’s-purse zoophyte\r\n(_Notamia_).\r\n\r\nFig. 22 is a portion of the _Bugula_, with one of the curious\r\n“birds’-head” processes. These appendages have the most absurd likeness\r\nto a bird’s head, the beak opening and shutting with a smart snap (so\r\nsmart, indeed, that the ear instinctively tries to catch the sound),\r\nand the head nodding backward and forward just as if the bird were\r\npecking up its food. On Plate XII. Fig. 2, is a pretty zoophyte called\r\n_Gemellaria_, on account of the double or twin-like form of the cells;\r\nand Fig. 5 represents the _Antennularia_, so called on account of its\r\nresemblance to the antennæ of an insect. Fig. 22 is an example of a\r\npretty zoophyte found parasitic on many sea-weeds, and known by the\r\nname of _Membranipora_. Two more specimens of zoophytes may be seen\r\non Plate XI. as they appear under polarised light. Fig. 17 is the\r\n_Cellularia reptans_; and Fig. 20 is the _Bowerbankia_, one form of\r\nwhich occurs in fresh water.\r\n\r\nAmong the worms we may refer to the beautiful little _Spirorbis_,\r\nwhose tiny coiled spiral tube may be found attached to almost every\r\nsea-weed, and which, when placed in a trough of sea-water, protrudes\r\nits beautiful crown of plumes. In chalk or other soft rocks, again,\r\nthe tubes of _Spio_, with its two long waving tentacles, may be found\r\nby hundreds. Then there are the centipede-like worms, which may be\r\nfound under nearly every stone, and which belong to the great family of\r\nNereids, provided with formidable jaws and stiff bristles of various\r\nforms. The Serpulæ are allied to the Spirorbis already mentioned. Parts\r\nof the so-called feet of one of these worms are shown in Fig. 36,\r\nwhere the spears or “pushing-poles” are seen gathered into bundles, as\r\nduring life. One of them, on a larger scale, is shown in Fig. 32. The\r\ngorgeous hairs of Aphrodite have already been alluded to.\r\n\r\nIn the sea the few species of Crustacea which fresh water offers to\r\nthe observer in the shape of Cyclops and its allies become thousands,\r\nand their changes during development are numerous and puzzling. Who,\r\nfor example, would suppose that the young stage of the Cyclops was\r\nindistinguishable in habits, and almost in form, from that of the\r\nbarnacle which adheres to the rocks? Yet such is the case, and there\r\nare other metamorphoses even more startling. Fig. 25 is the larva of\r\nthe common crab, once thought to be a separate species, and described\r\nas such under the name of _Zoæa_.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca proper will not afford us many objects, except in the form\r\nof their lingual ribbon, which may be extracted from the mouth, gently\r\nheated in _liquor potassæ_, and mounted in balsam after well washing,\r\nwhen the rows of teeth form splendid objects by polarised light. The\r\npalate of a whelk is shown in Plate XI. Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nAgain, the gills of the mussel will afford a beautiful illustration of\r\nciliary action. If a portion of the thin plates which lie along the\r\nedge of the shell be examined in a little of the liquor, the action may\r\nbe splendidly seen, and watched for a long time (Fig. 39).\r\n\r\nThe structure of shell, _e.g._ oyster-shell, is well shown in three\r\nexamples: Fig. 34 is a group of artificial crystals of carbonate of\r\nlime; and on Figs. 38 and 39 may be seen part of an oyster-shell,\r\nshowing how it is composed of similar crystals aggregated together.\r\nTheir appearance under polarised light may be seen on Plate XI. Figs. 1\r\nand 6.\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to the Echinoderms, including the star-fishes and\r\nsea-urchins.\r\n\r\nThe old story of the goose-bearing tree is an example of how truth may\r\nbe stranger than fiction. For if the fable had said that the mother\r\ngoose laid eggs which grew into trees, budded and flowered, and then\r\nproduced new geese, it would not have been one whit a stranger tale\r\nthan the truth. Plate IX. Fig. 33, shows the young state of one of\r\nthe common star-fishes (_Comátula_), which in its early days is like\r\na plant with a stalk, but afterwards breaks loose and becomes the\r\nwandering sea-star which we all know so well. In this process there\r\nis just the reverse of that which characterises the barnacles and\r\nsponges, where the young are at first free and then become fixed for\r\nthe remainder of their lives. Fig. 30 is the young of another kind of\r\nstar-fish, the long-armed Ophiúris, or snake-star.\r\n\r\nFig. 37 is a portion of the skin of the common sun-star (_Solaster_),\r\nshowing the single large spine surrounded by a circle of smaller\r\nspines, supposed to be organs of touch, together with two or three\r\nof the curious appendages called pedicellariæ. These are found on\r\nstar-fishes and Echini, and bear a close resemblance in many respects\r\nto the bird-head appendages of the zoophytes. They are fixed on\r\nfoot-stalks, some very long and others very short, and have jaws which\r\nopen and shut regularly. Their use is doubtful, unless it be to act as\r\npolice, and by their continual movements to prevent the spores of algæ,\r\nor the young of various marine animals, from effecting a lodgment on\r\nthe skin. A group, of pedicellariæ from a star-fish is shown on a large\r\nscale on Plate XII. Fig. 6, and Fig. 9 of the same Plate shows the\r\npedicellariæ of the Echinus.\r\n\r\nUpon the exterior of the Echini, or sea-urchins, are a vast number of\r\nspines having a very beautiful structure, as may be seen by Fig. 35,\r\nPlate IX., which is part of a transverse section of one of these\r\nspines. An entire spine is shown on Plate XII. Fig. 12, and shows the\r\nball-and-socket joint on which it moves, and the membranous muscle that\r\nmoves it. Fig. 8 is the disc of the snake-star as seen from below.\r\nFig. 1 is a portion of skin of the sun-star, to show one of the curious\r\nmadrepore-like tubercles which are found upon this common star-fish.\r\nFig. 3 is a portion of cuttle “bone,” very slightly magnified, in order\r\nto show the beautiful pillar-like form of its structure; and Fig. 4\r\nis the same object seen from above. When ground very thin this is a\r\nmagnificent object for the polariscope.\r\n\r\nOne or two miscellaneous objects now come before our notice. Fig. 11\r\nis one of those curious marine plants, the Corallines, which are\r\nremarkable for depositing a large amount of chalky matter among their\r\ntissues, so as to leave a complete cast in white chalk when the\r\ncoloured living portion of the plant dies. The species of this example\r\nis _Jania rubens_.\r\n\r\nFig. 19 is part of the pouch-like inflation of the skin, and the hairs\r\nfound upon the rat’s tail, which is a curious object as bearing so\r\nclose a similitude to Fig. 22, the sea-mat zoophyte. Fig. 23 is a\r\nportion of the skin taken from the finger, which has been injected\r\nwith a coloured preparation in order to show the manner in which the\r\nminute blood-vessels or “capillaries” are distributed; and Fig. 26 is a\r\nportion of a frog’s lung, also injected.\r\n\r\nThe process of injection is a rather difficult one, and requires\r\nconsiderable anatomical knowledge. The principle is simple enough,\r\nbeing merely to fill the blood-vessels with a coloured substance, so as\r\nto exhibit their form as they appear while distended with blood during\r\nthe life of the animal. It sometimes happens that when an animal is\r\nkilled suddenly without effusion of blood, as is often seen in the case\r\nof a mouse caught in a spring trap, the minute vessels of the lungs and\r\nother organs become so filled with coagulated blood as to form what is\r\ncalled a natural injection, ready for the microscope.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject I must ask the reader to refer again for a\r\nmoment to the frog’s foot on Plate X., and to notice the arrangement\r\nof the dark pigment spots. It is well known that when frogs live in a\r\nclear sandy pond, well exposed to the rays of the sun, their skins are\r\nbright yellow, and that when their residence is in a shady locality,\r\nespecially if sheltered by heavy overhanging banks, they are of a deep\r\nblackish-brown colour. Moreover, under the influence of fear they will\r\noften change colour instantaneously. The cause of this curious fact is\r\nexplained by the microscope.\r\n\r\nUnder the effects of sunlight the pigment granules are gathered\r\ntogether into small rounded spots, as seen on the left hand of the\r\nfigure, leaving the skin of its own bright yellow hue. In the shade the\r\npigment granules spread themselves so as to cover almost the entire\r\nskin and to produce the dark brown colour. In the intermediate state\r\nthey assume the bold stellate form in which they are shown on the right\r\nhand of the round spots. Very remarkable forms of these cells may be\r\nfound in the skin of the cuttle-fish.\r\n\r\nFigs. 24 and 25 are two examples of coal, the former being a\r\nlongitudinal and the latter a transverse section, given in order to\r\nshow its woody character. Fig. 17 is a specimen of gold-dust intermixed\r\nwith crystals of quartz sand, brought from Australia; and Fig. 21 is a\r\nsmall piece of copper-ore.\r\n\r\nEvery possessor of a microscope should, as soon as he can afford it,\r\nadd to his instrument the beautiful apparatus for polarising light.\r\nThe optical explanation of this phenomenon is far too abstruse for\r\nthese pages, but the practical application of the apparatus is very\r\nsimple. It consists of two prisms, one of which, called the polariser,\r\nis fastened by a catch just below the stage; and the other, called an\r\nanalyser, is placed above the eye-piece. In order to aid those bodies\r\nwhose polarising powers are but weak, a thin plate of selenite is\r\ngenerally placed on the stage immediately below the object. The colours\r\nexhibited by this instrument are gorgeous in the extreme, as may be\r\nseen by Plate XI., which affords a most feeble representation of the\r\nglowing tints exhibited by the objects there depicted. The value of the\r\npolariser is very great, as it often enables observers to distinguish,\r\nby means of their different polarising properties, one class of objects\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\nIf the expense of a polarising apparatus be too great for the means\r\nof the microscopist, he may manufacture a substitute for it by taking\r\nseveral thin plates of glass, arranging them in a paper tube so that\r\nthe light may meet the surface of the lowest one at an angle of about\r\n52°, and placing the bundle above the eye-piece to act as an analyser;\r\nwhilst, by using a plate of glass, and so arranging the lamp that the\r\nlight falls upon it at the above angle, and is reflected up the tube\r\nof the microscope, he will find on rotating the extemporised analyser\r\nthat the phenomena of polarisation are to a great extent reproduced;\r\nwhilst by splitting an extremely thin film from the surface of a sheet\r\nof mica, such as is employed for making smoke-screens above glass\r\nglobes, he will have a substitute for the selenite by means of which\r\nalone can the gorgeous effects be produced. The extemporised apparatus\r\nwill not, of course, give such perfect effects, but this is sometimes\r\nan advantage, and the present writer has used the same means with\r\nconsiderable success in photographing starch-granules.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n  FIG.\r\n   1.

Reference must be made, for further information, to\r\nsuch publications as the _Journal of the Royal Microscopical Society_,\r\nor that of the Quekett Club, or to the monographs on the various\r\ndepartments. Davies’ work on the general subject will also be found\r\nuseful by the beginner.\r\n\r\nTaking first the question of reagents, we may mention five which leave\r\nthe cells of a tissue as nearly as possible in the natural condition,\r\nbut fit for permanent preservation. The first of these, in order of\r\nimportance and of general applicability, is alcohol, represented for\r\nmost purposes by methylated spirit, which contains about 84 per cent.\r\nof absolute alcohol, though, unfortunately for our purpose, there is\r\na certain quantity of mineral naphtha in it in addition. This last\r\nhas the effect of making it go milky upon dilution with water, which\r\nis a considerable disadvantage, though the milkiness disappears to\r\nsome extent on standing, and it is rarely worth the while of the\r\nordinary microscopist to go through the formalities necessary to obtain\r\npermission to purchase unmineralised spirit, which cannot be had in\r\nquantities of less than five gallons (as it is only to be had from the\r\ndistillers under an Excise permit), and distillers may not supply less.\r\n\r\nFour parts of methylated spirit with one of water forms the classical\r\n“70 per cent.” alcohol, the most generally useful of all fluids for\r\nhardening and preserving purposes. A considerable quantity of this\r\nfluid should always be available.\r\n\r\nWhatever other fluid may be used to begin with, spirit must almost\r\nalways be used to finish the process, and fit the tissue for\r\nsection-cutting and staining.\r\n\r\nOf purely preservative, or fixative, fluids, we may mention “formalin,”\r\na 40 per cent. solution of formic aldehyde, which is rapidly coming to\r\nthe front, as indeed it deserves to do. It is but slightly poisonous,\r\nif at all, and leaves in the tissue nothing which requires subsequent\r\nremoval before proceeding to harden for section-work, whilst it is an\r\nadmirable preservative of cell-form.\r\n\r\nAnother admirable but highly poisonous reagent is corrosive sublimate,\r\nin saturated solution, with 2 per cent. of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nA fourth is osmic acid, used in 1 per cent. solution. This is a highly\r\nvaluable reagent, but extremely expensive, very poisonous, and giving\r\noff fumes which are most irritating to the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe fifth, a very gentle, but in many respects very satisfactory one,\r\nis picric acid in saturated solution. Tissues preserved in this medium\r\nmust not be washed out with water, as it enters into very feeble\r\ncombination with protoplasm, and the cells swell and disintegrate as\r\nthe reagent is dissolved out.\r\n\r\nOf mounting media we may mention glycerine, glycerine jelly (made\r\nby dissolving starch in glycerine with the aid of heat), and Canada\r\nbalsam, dissolved in xylol or benzole. The Canada balsam must be dried\r\nhard by evaporation over a water-bath, and dissolved as wanted. Under\r\nno circumstances should raw balsam be used, as it takes years to set\r\nhard, and turns of a deep yellow colour in the process.\r\n\r\nChloroform is frequently used as a solvent, but it has the disadvantage\r\nof attacking and extracting a large number of the aniline dyes used for\r\nstaining structures, an objection from which the mineral solvents are\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to go through the objects already referred to, and\r\nindicate the method of preservation.\r\n\r\nFor the study of the cell-structures of plants the portion to be\r\nexamined is to be placed in spirit of about 30 per cent. strength,\r\nwhich is changed after twenty-four hours for 40 per cent., after a\r\nfurther twenty-four hours for 55 per cent., and finally, as regards\r\nour present purpose, in 70 per cent. spirit, in which it may remain\r\nuntil required for section-cutting. The effect of this treatment is\r\nto extract the bulk of the water from the tissue, with the minimum of\r\nshrinkage of the cells, the latter being preserved in their natural\r\nrelations to surrounding parts.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, it is desirable to examine and preserve\r\ndelicate structures, or parts, or dissections, in a medium which allows\r\nof the retention of the greater part of the natural moisture, and in\r\nsuch a case the tissue is immersed in glycerine diluted very much in\r\nthe same way as the alcohol in the last process, but with very much\r\nlonger intervals between the alterations of strength, until it reaches\r\npure glycerine, in which it remains for a considerable time, as the\r\nexchange between the tissue and the dense fluid surrounding it goes on\r\nvery slowly.\r\n\r\nA combination of the two methods is also possible, the spirit-hardening\r\nbeing carried out for a portion of the time, and the tissue being\r\nthereafter transferred to glycerine, diluted or pure.\r\n\r\nThe object of using glycerine at all is merely that it has a much\r\nlower refractive index than balsam, so that delicate structures may\r\nsometimes be better seen in the former medium, but balsam is to be\r\npreferred wherever it is possible to use it, _i.e._ almost always.\r\nThe writer has not mounted a preparation in glycerine or a medium\r\ncontaining it for many years, nor, with proper staining, does he think\r\nit can ever be necessary to do so, except in the case of dissections\r\nin which the glycerine can be slowly run in without disturbing the\r\narrangement, as spirit would be pretty sure to do. The harder portions\r\nof plants, woody stems, shells of fruit, or the like, require different\r\ntreatment, and must, as a rule, be allowed to dry thoroughly before\r\nbeing cut.\r\n\r\nStarch granules are somewhat troublesome to mount satisfactorily.\r\nThe writer has tried many methods, and, on the whole, prefers a\r\nglycerin-gelatin medium, which keeps for an almost indefinite time, and\r\nmay be made as follows: Thirty grains of gelatine (Nelson’s “brilliant”\r\nor other transparent gelatine is to be preferred) are allowed to soak\r\nin water, and the swollen gelatine is drained, and dissolved in the\r\nwater which it has absorbed, by the aid of a gentle heat. An equal\r\nbulk of pure glycerine is then added. In using, a small portion is\r\ntransferred to a slide with the point of a knife and melted, a small\r\nquantity of starch granules added, and stirred into it with a needle.\r\nThe cover-glass is then laid up on the still-fluid drop, pressed gently\r\ndown so that the drop is extended to the margin of the cover, and the\r\nwhole allowed to cool. It is then to be painted round with several\r\nlayers of Brunswick black, or Hollis’s glue, or zinc-white cement, to\r\nprevent evaporation,--Hollis’s glue being perhaps the best medium for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nPetals, or other parts of which it is desired to obtain a surface view,\r\nmust be mounted in cells, which may be made by the use of button-moulds\r\nof suitable size, cemented to the glass slide with marine glue. The\r\nslide must be free from grease, as the tissue must be fixed in position\r\nby the use of gum, and allowed to dry thoroughly before closing the\r\ncell, or the cover-glass will be bedewed with moisture when the cell\r\nis closed. The best plan is, after air-drying for a couple of days,\r\nto place the preparation on a metal plate over a beaker of boiling\r\nwater for an hour or more, and then to close the cell immediately with\r\nBrunswick black, maintaining the heat at first to ensure rapid drying,\r\nand then slowly withdrawing it. When cool, another coat should be\r\ngiven, and rather thick covers should be used, as these preparations\r\nare never required to be examined with high powers.\r\n\r\nTo mount pollen-grains, they should be sprinkled upon the surface of a\r\nslide which has been previously moistened with thin gum, and allowed\r\nto dry until it has become just “tacky”; the drying is then completed\r\nby gentle heat and a drop of balsam placed upon the grains, with a\r\ncover-glass over all. Bubbles will probably form, but with Canada\r\nbalsam this is not of the slightest importance, as they always come\r\nout of their own accord, and balsam mounts should never be closed with\r\ncement of any kind until thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\nAir-bubbles in other media may be eliminated by the use of the\r\nair-pump shown in Fig. 16, which may be obtained from Baker at a very\r\nreasonable rate, and which is useful not only for that purpose, but for\r\naccelerating the drying of moist tissues. To do this, there is placed\r\nupon the plate of the pump a porcelain dish containing strong sulphuric\r\nacid, and upon this is placed a little triangle of platinum wire, which\r\nserves to support the preparation. The air is now exhausted; the tissue\r\nparts with moisture to supply its place, and this moisture is in turn\r\ngreedily absorbed by the sulphuric acid, so that drying is rapid and\r\ncontinuous, as well as very thorough, whilst the process has the great\r\nadvantage of dispensing entirely with the use of heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nPortions of many of the delicate algæ may be mounted in glycerine,\r\nhaving previously been soaked in it as already described; whilst the\r\nunicellular forms, such as desmids and diatoms, may be preserved in\r\nalmost exactly the natural condition by simply mounting them in a\r\nsaturated solution of picric acid.\r\n\r\nProbably formalin, in a solution of 10 per cent. strength, would answer\r\nthe purpose equally well, but the writer has not tried it. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that, with such extremely fluid media, great\r\ncare is required in closing the cell. A thin layer of Hollis’s glue\r\nshould be first painted on, to secure the cover in position, and when\r\nthis is thoroughly dry, several successive layers must be added in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nIt may be said here, that it is advisable in all cases to use circular\r\ncover-glasses, as far as possible, as they lend themselves with great\r\nfacility to a mechanically accurate closure. This slide is placed\r\nupon a turn-table, carefully adjusted until the cover is seen to be\r\ncentral when rotated, and a brush, preferably a small camel-hair\r\npencil, charged with the desired fluid, but not in large excess, is\r\nheld against the junction of the slide and cover, whilst the table\r\nis rapidly spun. A little experience will teach better than any\r\ndescription what amount of fluid there should be in the brush, and how\r\nthick the cement should be. If too thick, it will drag off the cover;\r\nif too thin, it will flow over the latter and over the slide.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of diatom-skeletons as permanent objects is easy.\r\nConsisting, as they do, of pure silex, or flint,--_i.e._, practically\r\nglass,--they resist long boiling in acids, so that there is little\r\ndifficulty in isolating them from any organic matter with which they\r\nare mingled. It is generally recommended to treat them with strong\r\nnitric acid. This is a mistake. The acid acts much more powerfully\r\nand less violently when diluted with an equal bulk of water, and it\r\nis in an acid so diluted that portions of water-plants, or other\r\ndiatomaceous material, should be boiled in a glass beaker until all the\r\norganic matter is dissolved. The beaker should be covered with a glass\r\nplate, to prevent dissipation of the acid fumes. When the process is\r\ncomplete, usually in about half an hour, the contents of the beaker are\r\nthoroughly stirred with a glass rod, poured rapidly off into a larger\r\nbulk of cold water, and allowed to settle for another half-hour. The\r\nprocess is then repeated with a smaller bulk of water, several times,\r\nto allow the removal of the last traces of acid, and finally with\r\ndistilled water. The separation of the diatoms into grades is effected\r\nby settlement. The final result is poured into a tall glass vessel,\r\nand allowed to settle for, at first, a minute, the supernatant fluid\r\nagain poured off, and allowed to settle for two minutes, and so on, the\r\nperiod being gradually increased, and each sediment preserved apart.\r\nThe first will probably only be sand, but the proportion of diatoms\r\nwill increase with each separation, though there will always be a\r\ncertain proportion of sand of such a size as to settle at the same rate\r\nas the diatoms. Marine plants especially will furnish a rich harvest by\r\ntreatment as described.\r\n\r\nSolid diatomaceous deposits, such as kiesel-guhr, mountain-meal, and\r\nespecially the famous Oamaru deposit from New Zealand, demand different\r\ntreatment, and perhaps the best way is to disintegrate the mass, either\r\nby boiling with Sunlight soap (though the alkali attacks the flint to\r\nsome extent) or to mix the mass with a super-saturated solution of\r\nacetate of soda (made by saturating water with the crystals whilst\r\nboiling), and by successive coolings, heatings, and stirrings to cause\r\nthe process of crystallisation to break up the mass, which it will do\r\nvery thoroughly. The diatoms are then separated by sedimentation, as\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\nA small portion of the deposit may now be spread thinly on a glass\r\nslide, allowed to dry thoroughly, be treated with balsam, and covered.\r\n\r\nIf it be desired to select individual diatoms, this must be done under\r\nthe microscope, by means of a bristle fixed in a handle either with\r\nglue or sealing-wax. The diatom selected will adhere to the bristle\r\nif the latter be slightly greasy, and should then be transferred to\r\na slightly adhesive slide, coated either with thin solution of white\r\nshellac, or with thin gum nearly dry. When the forms desired are\r\nmounted, the preparation should be covered in balsam. The process is by\r\nno means as easily effected as described, however.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of insects, or parts of insects, as microscopic objects\r\nis a tedious and difficult task. The main point is the trouble of\r\nsoftening the integument and eliminating the colour.\r\n\r\nThe latter can, in any case, be only partially effected. The beginner\r\nwould do well to begin with a fairly easy form, such as the worker-ant.\r\nA good supply of these insects may be placed in a bottle of liquor\r\npotassæ, and left there for at least some days until they begin to\r\nbecome clear and limp. From time to time a specimen may be taken,\r\nwell washed with several waters, then with acetic acid and water of\r\na strength of about 10 per cent., then with weak spirit, about 50 per\r\ncent. An attempt may then be made to arrange the insect upon a slide,\r\nspreading out the legs so as to exhibit them to the best advantage, and\r\nwhen this has been done a cover-glass may be put on, supported in such\r\na way as to prevent absolute pressure. The spirit is then withdrawn\r\nby means of a piece of filtering-paper cut to a point, and strong\r\nspirit added. This is again succeeded by absolute alcohol, then by a\r\nmixture of turpentine and crystal carbolic acid in equal proportions,\r\nand finally the cover-glass is carefully lifted, and some thick balsam\r\nsolution dropped on, the limbs finally arranged by means of warm\r\nneedles, and the cover-glass carefully replaced and pressed gently down\r\nby means of a clip, which may be obtained for a few pence. The whole\r\nis then set aside to harden, the deficiency caused by evaporation made\r\ngood, the balsam allowed to dry, and the preparation finally painted\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the body, in large insects, must be removed, and this\r\nis effected during the washing in water by gentle pressure with a\r\ncamel-hair brush, the process being aided, if necessary, by a small\r\nincision made through the integument at the root of the tail. Sections\r\nof insects require very special methods, which will hardly fall within\r\nthe scope of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSection-Cutting--Staining\r\n\r\n\r\nNo method of examination can equal, for general applicability and\r\nusefulness, that of section-work. The relations of the parts to each\r\nother being preserved, it is possible to draw conclusions as to their\r\nactual relations which no other mode allows of, and we shall devote\r\nthis concluding chapter to some account of the methods to be employed\r\nto this end.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus required is not necessarily complicated. Reduced to its\r\nelements, it consists essentially only of a razor to cut the sections\r\nand a dish to receive them. It but seldom happens, however, that the\r\nrelations of the parts in sufficiently thin sections can be preserved\r\nby such a rough-and-ready method, and frequently the object to be cut\r\nis of such small dimensions as to render it impossible to deal with it\r\nin this way. It is therefore necessary to “imbed” it, so as to obtain\r\na handle by which to hold it, in such a way that it shall be equally\r\nsupported in all directions. Moreover, since the human hand can only\r\nin exceptional cases be brought to such a pitch of skill as to cut a\r\nseries of sections, or even single ones, of the needful delicacy, some\r\nmechanical means of raising the object through a definite distance is\r\nhighly desirable. The writer has cut many thousands of sections with\r\nthe “free hand,” but the personal equation is a large one, and is not\r\nalways the same in the same person. For single sections the method\r\nwill, with practice, succeed very well, but some means of securing\r\na number of sections of more or less the same thickness is usually\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nLet us deal with the imbedding first.\r\n\r\nIf it be desired to imbed a tissue which has merely been fixed\r\nwith formalin, the block should be immersed in strong gum (made by\r\nsaturating water with picked gum arabic, white and clean) for several\r\ndays. It is then taken out and, without draining, transferred to the\r\nplate of a freezing microtome, and the sections cut from the frozen\r\nblock, and mounted in glycerine at once.\r\n\r\nThis plan is of limited usefulness, since it allows of very little\r\ndifferentiation of the tissue elements, and that only optical.\r\n\r\nTo get the best results, some plan of staining must be adopted. Perhaps\r\nthe simplest, and certainly a very excellent one, is as follows. After\r\nthe tissue has been passed from the hardening, or fixing, fluid into\r\nthe successive alcohols, as described, it is placed in the following\r\nsolution. Take about forty grains of carmine and eighty grains of\r\nborax, dissolve in about an ounce of water, add to the mixture an ounce\r\nof methylated spirit, and let it stand for some time with frequent\r\nshaking; about a week will be sufficient, and the process of solution\r\nmay be hastened by gentle warming at intervals. The clear upper portion\r\nis then poured off, and into this the block of tissue is dropped, and\r\nallowed to remain until thoroughly penetrated. Perhaps the best plan is\r\nto substitute the carmine solution for the 50 per cent. alcohol, and\r\nthus to make the staining a stage in the hardening process. From the\r\ncarmine solution the tissue is transferred to 70 per cent. alcohol, to\r\neach ounce of which two drops of hydrochloric acid have been added, and\r\nafter remaining in it for a day (with a piece of the usual size) is\r\nplaced in 70 per cent. alcohol, in two successive quantities. Sections\r\nfrom this material now only require treatment with the carbolic acid\r\nand turpentine above mentioned to be fit for mounting and covering in\r\nbalsam. We now proceed to indicate how the sections may be cut.\r\n\r\nA mixture of wax and almond oil, in proportions varying with the\r\nheat of the weather, usually about equal ones, is prepared. The\r\npiece of tissue is freed from superfluous spirit by being placed on\r\na bit of blotting-paper for a minute or two, and is then immersed in\r\na quantity of the wax-and-oil mixture contained in a little box of\r\npaper or lead-foil. The tissue is held on the point of a needle, and\r\nlifted up and down until it is coated with the mixture, and, before\r\nsolidification of the mass sets in, is lowered into the box and left\r\nto cool. The block now furnishes a handle, and this should be wrapped\r\nround with paper, the sections cut with the keenest possible razor,\r\nand as thin as possible, and placed in spirit as cut. From the spirit,\r\nwhich must be the strongest obtainable, they are placed in the clearing\r\nliquid, carbolic and turpentine, and then slid on to the slide, a drop\r\nof balsam placed on the section, and the cover over all. Of late years\r\nall sections of ordinary soft tissues, animal or vegetable, have been\r\ncut by one of the infiltration methods, in which the interstices of the\r\ntissue are filled up by some material which prevents the relations of\r\nthe cells from being altered during the process of cutting. To enter\r\nfully into this matter would occupy too much space, and would serve no\r\nuseful purpose, for the worker who requires to make use of such means\r\nwill find it indispensable to obtain Bolles Lee’s _Microtomist’s Vade\r\nMecum_, in which the whole matter is exhaustively treated.\r\n\r\nThe simple method above detailed will answer most ordinary purposes,\r\nprovided that a few precautions be attended to. The chief are as\r\nfollows. The outside of the block of tissue must be sufficiently dry\r\nfor the wax-and-oil to adhere to it. The razor must be extremely\r\nsharp, and must be kept so by application to a Turkey stone during\r\nthe section-cutting. The blade must be drawn across the tissue from\r\nheel to point, and kept wetted with spirit the whole time, so as to\r\nprevent any dragging of the section. The transference of the section to\r\nthe slide must be effected by means of a section-lifter, which may be\r\nmade by beating out a piece of stout copper wire to a thin flat blade;\r\nor a small palette-knife, or German-silver lifter, may be purchased\r\nfor a few pence. The carbolic turpentine is best used by placing a\r\nlittle in a watch-glass, and floating the sections on to it by lifting\r\nthem singly with the lifter, freeing them from superfluous spirit\r\nby draining on to blotting-paper, and allowing them to float on to\r\nthe surface of the liquid in the watch-glass, so that the spirit may\r\nevaporate from above, and be replaced by the clearing agent from below\r\nThe balsam solution should be thin, and the cover-glass must be allowed\r\nto settle down into place without pressure.\r\n\r\nThe question of staining sections is a very large one, and is becoming\r\nof daily increasing complexity.\r\n\r\nWe cannot go into it here, further than to say that most sections cut\r\nfrom unstained tissue will yield excellent results if stained first\r\nwith Delafield’s logwood solution (to be obtained at Baker’s) to a\r\nvery slight extent, and then with a solution of safranin. The sections\r\nshould be washed with tap-water after the logwood stain, and should be\r\nof a pale violet colour. If over-stained, the colour may to a great\r\nextent be removed by washing with a very weak solution of hydrochloric\r\nacid, about two drops of acid to each ounce of water, and repeated\r\nwashing in tap-water to remove the acid, and restore the violet. The\r\nsafranin stain should be weak, and should be allowed to act for some\r\ntime. From this last the sections are transferred to strong spirit,\r\nthe latter being renewed until the sections cease to give up the red\r\ndye; and they may then be mounted as described. The results with most\r\ntissues are superb, every detail of the structure being splendidly\r\nbrought out. Safranin alone is also an admirable stain for many\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nFurther information must be sought in the book already mentioned.\r\nLet us, in closing, warn the beginner of two things which are of\r\ngeneral application in practical microscopy. The first is, not to be\r\ndiscouraged by failures. The manipulations are in many cases very\r\ndelicate, and premiums must be paid to experience for insurance against\r\nfailure in every one of the processes.\r\n\r\nThe second is, that the most scrupulous cleanliness will hardly suffice\r\nto prevent contamination of preparation by the all-pervasive dust\r\nwhich, invisible to the eye, assumes colossal proportions under the\r\nmicroscope, and the particles of which have an unpleasant habit of\r\ncollecting on the most interesting or most beautiful portion of the\r\npreparation. This can only be guarded against by careful filtration of\r\nall fluids, and constant watchfulness.\r\n\r\nA preparation properly made is a thing of beauty, and a joy for\r\never,--or if not for ever, at any rate for many years; and one such\r\nwill repay an infinitude of pains taken in its production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n            PAGE\r\n  Air-pump, 174\r\n  Algæ, 78\r\n    \"   marine, 92\r\n  Anemones, sea, 159\r\n  Antennæ, 96\r\n  Ants, 97\r\n\r\n  Bacillaria, 87\r\n  Balancers of Fly, 112\r\n  Bark, 61\r\n  Blights, 89\r\n  Blood, circulation of, 129\r\n    \"    corpuscles of, 128\r\n  Bone, 123\r\n  Breathing-tubes, 109\r\n  Bull’s-eye, use of, 32\r\n\r\n  Camera lucida, 25\r\n  Canada Balsam, 170\r\n  Cartilage, 124\r\n  Cells, animal, 122\r\n    \"    circulation in, 40\r\n    \"    mounting dry in, 173\r\n    \"    pigment, 121, 165\r\n    \"    spiral, 46\r\n    \"    vegetable, 37\r\n  Ceramidia, 93\r\n  Chlorophyll, 40\r\n  Compressorium, Beck’s, 18\r\n  Condenser, bull’s-eye, 19\r\n    \"        substage, 19\r\n  Confervæ, 84\r\n  Conjugation, 82, 84\r\n  Convex lenses, 7\r\n        \"        foci of, 7, 8\r\n        \"        image formed by, 10\r\n        \"        virtual image, 11\r\n  Corallines, 164\r\n  Corrosive sublimate, 170\r\n  Cover-glasses, 18\r\n\r\n  Desmids, 81\r\n  Diatoms, 85\r\n    \"      preparation of, 175\r\n  Dipping-tubes, 22\r\n  Dissection, 20\r\n    \"         instruments, 21\r\n    \"         under microscope, 24\r\n  Drawing, 25\r\n    \"      squares, 26\r\n\r\n  Echinoderms, 162\r\n  Entomostraca, 152\r\n  Epidermis, animal, 122\r\n    \"        vegetable, 68\r\n  Extemporised apparatus, 5\r\n\r\n  Feathers, 119\r\n  Fish, scales of, 118\r\n    \"   parasites of, 153\r\n  Fixation of cell-forms, 171\r\n  Focus of mirror, 29\r\n  Foraminifera, 156\r\n  Formalin, 164\r\n  Frog-plate, 129\r\n\r\n  Gills of mussel, 122\r\n  Gizzard of insects, 109\r\n  Glycerine-gelatine, 172\r\n    \"       jelly, 171\r\n\r\n  Hairs, animal, 116\r\n    \"    vegetable, 53\r\n  Heads of Insects, 104\r\n\r\n  Illumination, correct, 31, 32\r\n    \"           dark-field, 34\r\n    \"           for opaque objects, 33\r\n  Imbedding, 180\r\n    \"        by infiltration, 182\r\n  Infusoria, 135\r\n  Injection, 164\r\n  Insects, 97\r\n    \"      mounting of, 177\r\n\r\n  Jelly-fish, 158\r\n\r\n  Larva of _Chironomus_, 152\r\n  Light, arrangement of, 29\r\n  Live-box, 17\r\n  Logwood solution, 183\r\n\r\n  Magnification, to measure, 27\r\n  Mare’s tail, 91\r\n  Marine life, 155\r\n  Microscope, Baker’s, 14\r\n     \"          \"     “portable”, 15\r\n     \"        primitive, 5\r\n     \"        simple, 12, 13\r\n  Mildew, 89\r\n  Mirror, concave, 29\r\n  Mollusca, 161\r\n  Mounting, 168\r\n    \"       dry, 173\r\n    \"       foraminifera, 157\r\n  Mosses, 96\r\n  Muscle, 127\r\n\r\n  Nails, 124\r\n  Needles, 22\r\n  Nerve, 127\r\n  Net, 133\r\n  Nucleus, 40\r\n\r\n  Objectives, 16\r\n  Objects, drawing of, 24\r\n    \"      photography of, 36\r\n  Oil-cells, 58, 61\r\n  Oscillatoriæ, 84\r\n  Osmic acid, 170\r\n\r\n  Parasites, 153\r\n  Petals, 69\r\n  Picric acid, 170\r\n  Pigment, 121\r\n  Pocket magnifiers, 13\r\n  Polariscope, 166\r\n  Pollen, 71\r\n  Polyzoa, 147\r\n  Pond-hunting, 132\r\n  Preservatives, 169\r\n\r\n  Radiolaria, 157\r\n  Rotifers, 147\r\n\r\n  Safranin stain, 183\r\n  Sap, 128\r\n  Scent-glands, 57\r\n  Sea-weeds, 92\r\n  Section-cutting, 178\r\n  Seeds, 75\r\n  Skin, 120\r\n  Spiracles, 102\r\n  Sponge, fresh-water, 135\r\n    \"     spicules, 155\r\n  Sporangia, 92\r\n  Stage-forceps, 116\r\n  Starch, 63\r\n    \"     mounting, 172\r\n  Stomata, 49\r\n  Suckers, 108\r\n\r\n  Teeth, 125\r\n  Troughs, glass, 18\r\n\r\n  Water-bears, 152\r\n  Wings, 110\r\n  Wool, 116\r\n  Worms, fresh-water, 14\r\n    \"    marine, 160\r\n\r\n  Yeast, 89\r\n\r\n  Zoœa, 161\r\n  Zoophytes, 157\r\n  Zygnemaceæ, 85\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY MORRISON AND GIBB LIMITED, EDINBURGH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Common Objects of the Microscope, by J.
