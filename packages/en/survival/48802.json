PHILADELPHIA, _Tenth Month, 1820._      _No. 10._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\nNo. IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of no infrequent occurrence, that erroneous estimates\r\nare formed of human conduct, and its immediate and remote effects\r\non the interests of society. When this is the case, we sometimes\r\ndenounce as hostile to social order and salutary improvement,\r\nthose who are really their most faithful and efficient friends,\r\nand in this way become the agents and disseminators of error and\r\ninjustice. There is nothing perhaps, more unfashionable, not to say\r\nmischievous, in the eyes of the present generation, than what they\r\ndenominate ENTHUSIASM; a temper of mind, which they are disposed\r\nto treat with the greatest contempt, as altogether unworthy the\r\nenlightened period in which we live. If the legitimate import of the\r\nword were always observed in its application, there would be little\r\ncontroversy on the subject; as no one would become the advocate\r\nof \"vain imaginations\" or \"violent passions.\" But it is believed\r\nthat much that is truly valuable in its character and tendency, is\r\nimproperly ascribed to this source; by which hostile prejudices are\r\nexcited, in opposition to that which is entitled to the countenance\r\nand support of the public.\r\n\r\nIn CHARLES J. FOX'S history of JAMES II. there is this passage:--\"We\r\nare accused of enthusiasm! are we then fanaticks? Are we enthusiasts\r\nbecause we do not rob--abstain from murder? If by enthusiasm be\r\nmeant _zeal and warmth_, I freely acknowledge it; I glory in it.\r\nEnthusiasm, when it arises out of _a just cause_, is that which\r\nmakes men act in it with energy; it is that, without which _nothing\r\nwas ever done great, since the creation of the world_. Enthusiasm of\r\nthis sort, I hope, therefore, I shall always possess.\" The historian\r\nreferred to, will not be classed among credulous, weak-minded\r\nmen; for he was one of the most eminent statesmen of his day; and\r\nhis opinion is therefore justly considered as authoritative. The\r\nposition taken, is corroborated by all experience, that great\r\nactions and great achievements are never the result of lukewarmness\r\nand indifference; but of \"zeal and warmth,\" directed to \"a good\r\ncause,\" without which honourable and permanent distinction can\r\nnever be obtained. What is too frequently mistaken for enthusiasm,\r\nis in reality produced by a profound conviction of the truth, in\r\nconnection with some particular object, of the greatest importance\r\nto mankind.\r\n\r\nIt was this that guided COLUMBUS across the unknown and boisterous\r\nocean, and opened to his view a new world; which enabled him to\r\nencounter and surmount every difficulty, which the malice of his\r\nenemies, or the combination of untoward circumstances, arrayed\r\nagainst his great design; a design which was branded as a chimera of\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nIt was this which induced FRANKLIN to persevere in his philosophical\r\nexperiments, until they were crowned with success; and the identity\r\nof lightning and the electric fluid, completely established, and\r\neventually placed his name among the most eminent philosophers of\r\nthe age.\r\n\r\nIt was this, that enabled RITTENHOUSE to emerge from the condition\r\nof an humble mechanic in Montgomery county, and by the construction\r\nof his wonderful Orrery, to obtain from Jefferson this great but\r\nwell-merited testimony to his talents;--\"that no mortal was ever\r\npermitted to make so near an approach to his Creator.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this that strengthened the hands of the immortal FOUNDER of\r\nPennsylvania, in his noble determination of sacrificing the bright\r\nprospects which birth and connexions imparted, to a sense of duty;\r\nand of establishing an asylum in a remote wilderness, where the\r\noppressed of all nations, kindred, and people, might find a covert\r\nfrom the storm of civil and religious persecution, and enjoy in\r\nperfect security the sacred rights of conscience.\r\n\r\nIt was this which guided the footsteps of HOWARD to the distant\r\nabodes of wretchedness and wo, unmindful of the comforts and\r\ndelights of home, to bind up the sorrows of their miserable\r\ntenants, and to complete, in the language of Burke, his \"noble\r\ncircumnavigation of charity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this which conducted FULTON to that astonishing result,\r\njustly considered as the great wonder of the age--_navigation by\r\nsteam_; after a crowd of discouragements and difficulties had been\r\nsubdued, sufficient to disconcert the plans and defeat the object of\r\nalmost any other man, however sanguine his temper and resolute his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt was this which under Providence induced that signal victory,\r\nobtained in Great Britain, by SHARP, WILBERFORCE, and CLARKSON, over\r\nthe disgrace of humanity and civilization, the SLAVE-TRADE; after a\r\nmost doubtful and arduous conflict of more than twenty years, with\r\navarice and oppression.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, nothing but this active and persevering zeal, will,\r\n_in future_, lead to like glorious results. Instead, therefore, of\r\nits being opprobriously branded, let it be cherished, when directed\r\nto just and important objects, as a prolific source of good to man.\r\nScientific research has an ample field before her still unexplored,\r\nin which no doubt laurels will continue to be reaped, and great and\r\nsubstantial advantages be derived by new discoveries. But the _moral\r\nimprovement_ of our fellow citizens, should be sedulously attended\r\nto, as more immediately soliciting our notice; and the cause of\r\nsuch of them as are denied the rights to which they are by nature\r\nentitled, should be fearlessly and constantly vindicated, as truth\r\nand justice may open the way; notwithstanding those may be denounced\r\nas ENTHUSIASTS, who believe that in the eye of the great Creator,\r\n\"ALL MEN ARE EQUAL.\" ☞\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETY.\r\n\r\nFor the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fogs of England have been at all times the complaint of\r\nforeigners. Gondomar the Spanish ambassador, when some one who was\r\ngoing to Spain waited on him to ask whether he had any commands,\r\nreplied, \"Only my compliments to the Sun, whom I have not seen since\r\nI came to England.\" Caracoli, the Neapolitan minister there, a man\r\nof a good deal of conversational wit, used to say that the only\r\nripe fruit he had seen in England, were roasted apples; and in a\r\nconversation with George II., he took the liberty of preferring the\r\nMoon of Naples to the Sun of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN HOWARD.\r\n\r\nI have been frequently asked, says this great man, what precautions\r\nI use to preserve myself from infections in the prisons and\r\nhospitals I visit. I here answer, next to the free goodness and\r\nmercy of the Author of my being, temperance and cleanliness are my\r\npreservatives. Trusting in Divine Providence, and believing myself\r\nin the way of my duty, I visit the most noxious cells, and while\r\nthus employed, \"I fear no evil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN.\r\n\r\nHe that raises a large family, says Franklin, does indeed, while\r\nhe lives to observe them, _stand_, as Watts says, _a broader mark\r\nfor sorrow_; but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too.\r\nWhen we launch our little fleet of barks into the ocean, bound\r\nto different ports, we hope for each, a prosperous voyage; but\r\ncontrary winds, hidden shoals, storms and enemies, come in for a\r\nshare in the disposition of events; and though these occasion a\r\nmixture of disappointment, yet considering the risk where we can\r\nmake no insurance, we should think ourselves happy if some return\r\nwith success.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS THE POET.\r\n\r\nAbout the age of thirteen, Burns was sent during a part of the\r\nsummer to the parish school in Dalrymple, in order to improve\r\nhis hand writing.--In the following year he had an opportunity\r\nof passing several weeks with his old friend Murdoch, with\r\nwhose assistance he began to study French with intense ardour\r\nand assiduity. His proficiency in that language, though it was\r\nwonderful, considering his opportunities, was necessarily slight;\r\nyet it was in shewing this accomplishment alone that Burns' weakness\r\never took the shape of vanity. One of his friends, who carried him\r\ninto the company of a French lady, remarked with surprise that he\r\nattempted to converse with her in her own tongue. Their French,\r\nhowever, was soon found to be almost mutually unintelligible. As far\r\nas Burns could make himself understood, he unfortunately offended\r\nthe foreign lady.--He meant to tell her that she was a charming\r\nperson and delightful in conversation; but expressed himself so as\r\nto appear to her to mean, that she was fond of speaking; to which\r\nthe Gallic dame indignantly replied, that it was quite as common for\r\npoets to be impertinent, as for women to be loquacious.\r\n\r\n\r\nORTHOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe following curious instances of spelling are from Bassompierre's\r\naccount of his mission to the court of Charles I. in 1626.\r\n\r\nSir Edward Sackville, (Hacfil;) Earl of Dorset, (Dorchet;)\r\nBuckingham, (Boukinkam;) York-House, (Jorschaux;) Earl of\r\nBridgewater, (Britswater;) Whitehall, (Withal;) Cheapside,\r\n(Shipside;) Wimbledon, (Semilton;) Wallingford, (Vialenforaux;)\r\nBlackfriars, (Blaifore;) Kensington, (Stintinton;) Berkshire,\r\n(Barcher.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN: ITS BAD AND GOOD CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn agricultural traveller, who has recently passed through parts of\r\nMontgomery, Berks, Lehigh, Northampton and Philadelphia counties,\r\nby the great roads leading through them, wishes, most cordially and\r\nearnestly to call the attention of the farmers to their unfortunate\r\nstyle of agriculture in some important particulars.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the neighbourhood of Norristown, with a few\r\nexceptions, a barely tolerable field of Indian corn was rarely to be\r\nseen, until he arrived, on his return from Easton, into the southern\r\nparts of Bucks county. The foes to all good husbandry, weeds, were\r\npredominant in almost every cornfield. If, perchance, the interior\r\nwas tolerably clear, a circumstance which rarely, occurred, the\r\nweeds around the enclosures were so lamentably abundant, that the\r\ncorn was, in a great degree, obscured. Good and bad land exhibited\r\nthe like ruinous and disgusting appearance and miserable promise;\r\nand the same bad system of culture prevailed. The ploughing was\r\ngenerally shallow, whatever might be the texture of the soil.--Every\r\nfield was ridged; many had been broken up in bulks, and furrows\r\nwere always thrown up to the plants, for the drought to turn into\r\ndust, or indurate into impenetrable clods.--The middle spaces\r\nbetween the rows were untouched, either by the plough or the harrow\r\nin very numerous instances. Countless varieties of pestiferous\r\ncoarse grasses and weeds took possession of these neglected spots,\r\nfurnishing a counterbalance to any supplies from the earth or the\r\nair, which the corn plants, in the absence of these pests, might\r\nhave drawn, and effectually preventing the extension of their roots\r\nbeyond the bounds of the elevated furrows, or narrow ridges, in\r\nwhich they were imprisoned. Can it then be wondered at, that the\r\ncrops evidenced a sickly, stunted & wretched appearance, both in\r\ncolour and size? In some fields, where limestone prevailed, and,\r\nperhaps, lime had been applied, the colour was better, but the\r\nweeds and grasses abundant; on the head lands particularly, which\r\nare seldom sufficiently, if at all, stirred and cleaned: thus\r\nestablishing a mischievous nursery of poisonous pests to perpetuate\r\ntheir scourges on future crops. Fall ploughing was rarely, if\r\nat all, practised; and lime little used, even in many limestone\r\ndistricts. One farmer said, \"their land was hot enough without\r\nlime.\" It is hoped, that this superlative ignorance of the qualities\r\nof lime, which, when slacked, is the coldest of all substances\r\napplied to land, is confined to the individual sporting the opinion.\r\nOne of the uses of lime is to supply the soil, and that not too\r\nlavishly, with calcareous matter, when its caustic qualities are\r\nsubdued.\r\n\r\nThis is not exaggerated, but is a regretful picture. It is held\r\nup to intelligent and well-disposed farmers, who, by viewing its\r\ndeformities, may banish entirely their present mode of culture,\r\nwhich, by its own showing, is proved to be radically wrong. A\r\ncorn crop is not only in itself, but, when well cultivated, is in\r\nits consequences the most valuable of all our products. With an\r\nabhorrence of weeds, the test of intelligence in a farmer, he can,\r\nwith a corn crop, more effectually clean and prepare his fields for\r\nsucceeding crops, than can be done by any other culture. Whilst\r\nhe is attending his corn, which will not, with impunity, suffer\r\nneglect, he is not only invigorating and increasing his crop, but\r\nhe is subduing his worst enemies--weeds of all kinds. This makes\r\nample amends for the exhaustion of the soil by this gigantic plant.\r\n\r\nThe change recommended, is dictated not only by reasonable theory,\r\nbut is founded on long experience and multitudinous practical proofs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Deep and Flat Culture._\r\n\r\nPlough your fields throughout _deeply_; and _that_ in the fall, to\r\nexpose and destroy the eggs of the grub moth; and roll, to pulverize\r\nthe clods. Harrow in lime at this season, or on spring ploughed\r\nground, for corn; and do not spread it on your fallows for wheat;\r\nbecause it is then injurious to your winter grain crop; as frequent\r\nexperience has shown. Mark out your squares or drills, lightly, with\r\nthe plough; and thereafter never suffer the plough to enter your\r\nfields. Work entirely with _harrows_; whereof procure the necessary\r\nvariety; some with large, and others with smaller _hoes_. These\r\ncut up weeds, and sufficiently stir your intervals to any depth\r\nyou choose. If the hand hoes be found indispensable, use them near\r\nyour plants; but never hill or plough up furrows. The common harrow\r\nwill have its share of usefulness; and spare it not. As often as\r\nyoung weeds appear, or your surface becomes crusty, often occasioned\r\nby drought after rains, ply the harrows. You will then have a\r\ndeep, loose and light body of pulverized soil, for your roots to\r\npenetrate. It will imbibe the dews and gases from the atmosphere;\r\nand afford, in the severest droughts, perpetual moisture and\r\nnourishment; which will be exclusively applied to your corn plant;\r\nhaving no robbers to contend with. In droughts, deeply stirred\r\nsoil inhales and _retains_ moisture. In wet seasons it is the\r\nleast injured; because it affords room for superabundant wetness.\r\nBeing elastic and buoyant, it does not consolidate or settle into\r\nconcrete bodies, like shallow ploughed, cloddy, and unstirred\r\nground. The corn roots (which have, in such ground, been measured\r\nten feet long,) will have a continuous and not a divided soil,\r\nwherein to expand and extend themselves; in which, it being loose,\r\ndeep, and constantly moist, the roots will far exceed those confined\r\nto narrow detached ridges, wherein they are short and starved. It is\r\nan idle opinion, to suppose that plants spend themselves in roots.\r\nThe stronger, the root, the more vigorous is the plant.\r\n\r\nIf you _will_ introduce the plough after the first breaking up,\r\neither before or after planting; and squares are the most commodious\r\nfor thorough stirring and cleaning; plough shallow; so as not to\r\ndisturb the deeply buried sod. Let the harrows level and flatten\r\nyour surface at the next operation; and continue them exclusively\r\nin all future stirrings. Your culture will be easier, cheaper, and\r\nmore abundantly profitable, than those who are accustomed to the old\r\nmodes will _believe_, until they _see_.\r\n\r\nIf your field requires drains, draw furrows in proper places. If it\r\nbe naturally wet, break up deeply in very broad lands, on which the\r\nharrows may still be used, and drains sufficiently multiplied. If it\r\nbe stony, rugged, or harsh, either plant other crops; or strengthen\r\nyour harrows; ridged ground dries the soonest, and burns through; so\r\ndoes all shallow ploughed soil, whether ridged or flat. Attraction\r\nof moisture is trifling, and evaporation rapid.\r\n\r\nBe not afraid of cutting corn roots, which benefit by excision;\r\nthrowing out, on the parts attached to the plants, numerous fibres,\r\nto draw in and communicate their food.\r\n\r\nYour corn, in deeply ploughed and frequently stirred ground, will\r\nresist storms and heavy rains, owing to the strength and numbers of\r\nits roots, far beyond hilled or ridged plants. If it yields to the\r\nstorm, and leans, the extent, tenacity, and re-acting contraction\r\nof the roots, will generally restore the erect position of the\r\nstalks: whereas, in the ridged or hill culture, the roots are short,\r\nbrittle, and incapable of recovery. It is not uncommon in the deep\r\nand flat culture, for those called finger roots, to grow entirely or\r\ngreatly extended _under_ instead of _above_ the surface; and throw\r\nout innumerable fibres, to support the stalk.\r\n\r\nDetach all suckers, which are robbers; and top, in due season, to\r\nshorten the lever, insure the standing of the stalks, and facilitate\r\nthe ripening of the grains.\r\n\r\nBanish all apprehensions, that working among corn in dry weather, is\r\ninjurious. The contrary is the truth; for your harrows will, in such\r\nweather, have the double effect of more certainly destroying weeds,\r\nand pulverizing, to open mouths to take in moisture and gases, from\r\nthe dews and the air.\r\n\r\nIt being seldom practised in Pennsylvania, I need not warn you\r\nagainst sowing winter grain in the same year with corn. This not\r\nonly scourges your land, but interferes with the great use of the\r\ncleaning culture, affording the time and opportunity for weeds to\r\nrecover their pestiferous reign, and is a sure test of slovenly and\r\ncovetous farming.\r\n\r\nIf you will not at once believe in this system of corn husbandry,\r\nnow frequently and ever successfully practised, where the best\r\ncrops are to be seen, try a small portion of your field--do it\r\njustice--and compare it with the old mode, for your own and your\r\nneighbour's conviction. Whatever may be hastily thought of these\r\nobservations, they are, with the most friendly wishes for their\r\nprosperity, offered for the serious consideration of liberal minded\r\nand unprejudiced farmers; among whom numberless instances of good\r\nfarming, in other respects, are to be found, and to which the\r\ngreatest proportion of the corn culture is a mortifying contrast.\r\n\r\n  _September 10, 1820._    MENTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  SEPT. 18, 1820.\r\n\r\n  Messrs. Richards & Caleb Johnson--\r\n\r\nIn the Lancaster Journal of September 8th, 1820, there is an\r\nexcellent charge of Judge Franklin to the Grand Jury, on the subject\r\nof the Act of Assembly \"for promoting agriculture and domestic\r\nmanufactures.\" I think it well deserving a place in your Magazine;\r\nas it contains, in epitome, much useful and impressive advice on\r\nthe importance of agriculture, and the formation of agricultural\r\nsocieties; by the instrumentality whereof both the principle,\r\nand practice of husbandry can be successfully promoted, and most\r\neffectually encouraged.--Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  RICHARD PETERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Address._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I am desirous at this time, gentlemen, of introducing to your\r\nnotice an Act of Assembly of this Commonwealth, passed at the\r\nlast session of the legislature, which, if its provisions be duly\r\nattended to, may produce many beneficial effects. It is entitled,\r\n\"An Act for the promotion of agriculture and domestic manufactures.\"\r\nThe 1st, 2d, and 3d, sections enact:\r\n\r\n\"That as soon as the Board of Commissioners and two-thirds of the\r\nGrand Jury, of any county within this Commonwealth, shall agree,\r\nin writing under their respective hands (which agreement shall be\r\nfiled in the office of the Prothonotary of the proper county) that a\r\nsociety shall be established within the same; then it shall and may\r\nbe lawful for twenty or more inhabitants of any such county, fifteen\r\nof whom shall be practical and actual farmers, under the name of The\r\nSociety for the Promotion of Agriculture and Domestic Manufactures,\r\nin and for such county, to sign an agreement, promising to pay the\r\ntreasurer of said society, so long as he shall remain a member\r\nthereof, the sum of one dollar each, or more, annually, for the\r\npurposes hereinafter mentioned, and cause such agreement to be\r\nfiled in the office of the Prothonotary of proper county; every\r\nsuch society shall by virtue of this act become a body politic and\r\ncorporate, in deed and in law, with perpetual succession, and all\r\nthe rights, liberties, privileges, and franchises incident to a\r\ncorporation, for all the purposes of this act, and to admit new\r\nmembers upon the terms aforesaid. _Provided_, That the association\r\nwhich shall have first filed their articles of agreement shall be\r\nthe only one entitled to the privileges granted by this act.\r\n\r\n\"That the said societies, respectively, shall meet at some\r\nconvenient place on the Wednesday of the next Court of Common Pleas,\r\nafter the said agreements shall have been filed as aforesaid, and\r\nchoose by a majority of votes, out of their number, one president,\r\nten directors, one treasurer, and one secretary, who shall be\r\nofficers of said society for one year and until others are duly\r\nelected. And the said societies respectively, at their first\r\nmeeting, shall have power to fix on the time and place of their\r\nannual meetings on such day of the year as they shall designate,\r\nwhich shall continue to be the day of the annual meeting of the\r\nsocieties respectively, until otherwise altered by a vote of\r\nthe members as aforesaid; and also to make their own rules and\r\nby-laws, not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States, or of this state; and to add other officers to those\r\ndesignated, and prescribe their respective duties. And the president\r\nand directors shall have power to summon special meetings of said\r\nsocieties respectively, at such other times as to them shall seem\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n\"That at the next assessment of county rates and levies, after said\r\nsocieties respectively shall have been established and organized\r\nin any county within this commonwealth, and annually thereafter,\r\nthe county commissioners are hereby required to assess, levy, and\r\ncause to be collected, in the same manner that county rates and\r\nlevies are assessed, levied, and collected, an additional sum of\r\nfifty dollars for every member which said counties respectively are\r\nor may be entitled to elect to the House of Representatives of this\r\ncommonwealth, and to cause the same to be paid to the treasurer\r\nof the society, by warrants drawn on the county treasurer: to be\r\nexpended, together with their annual subscriptions, in the manner\r\nhereinafter mentioned.\"\r\n\r\nI need not read the remaining sections of this law. The pamphlet\r\ncontaining it will be laid upon your table, and you will have an\r\nopportunity of deliberately considering it in all its parts.\r\n\r\nI wish to impress you, gentlemen, with the importance of this\r\nsubject, as it affects the vital interests of our country;\r\nparticularly at a time when our foreign markets are almost\r\ndestroyed, and we must learn to establish our prosperity on the\r\ninterchange of commodities within our own limits. This will produce\r\na solid independence, teach us the value of our connexions with one\r\nanother, and bind us in bonds of mutual interest. The struggle has\r\nheretofore been (and a fatal one it has proved) to get _rich_: the\r\nendeavour now must be, how to _live_ in comfort and plenty.\r\n\r\nThe consumption and use of the necessaries and conveniences of\r\nlife, by 10,000,000 of people, and the demands for the materials\r\nof domestic manufactures, cannot fail to afford to every quarter\r\nof our Union the means of substantial enjoyment. _Industry_ must\r\ntake the place of hazardous _Speculation_, and _Frugality_ must\r\nsucceed _Extravagance_. We shall then be taught to live within our\r\nmeans, and this will easily be accomplished, when we have only real\r\nwants, and not those which are, for the most part, artificial and\r\nfanciful. We must \"eat our bread in the sweat of our faces,\" and\r\nwe shall find it the sweetest and most nutritive of any food we\r\nhave heretofore enjoyed. It may not be accompanied by luxurious and\r\nexpensive viands; but its associates will be health, peace of mind,\r\nand corporeal vigour, ensuring exemplary life and purity of morals.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of the public prosperity is undoubtedly agriculture.\r\nThis brings forth all the materials about which other branches of\r\nlabour are, for the most part, employed, and sustains the workers in\r\nevery department of the mechanic arts, in their labours. Without it,\r\nthe earth would be a howling desert: with it, the cultivated world\r\nis an artificial Paradise, produced by the labour of Man, who, being\r\ndoomed to \"eat his bread in the sweat of his face,\" thus fulfils\r\nthe decrees of Heaven, while he ensures to himself and his race the\r\nblessings of plenty, innocence and health. To what a high destiny,\r\nthen, is the farmer appointed, when to him is committed the art on\r\nwhich the subsistence of his fellow men necessarily depends. His\r\nresponsibilities are great indeed; and shall he rely only on his\r\nindividual efforts and limited experience, for the fulfilment of\r\nsuch important duties? No: he should call to his aid the experience,\r\nthe intelligence, and the scientific as well as practical knowledge,\r\nwhich associations for promoting agriculture are universally found\r\nto afford, and thereby add to his own, the experience of those with\r\nwhom he is associated, and, by joint efforts, produce results to\r\nwhich any one individual is incompetent. The practices, good or\r\nbad, which are handed down by his predecessors, are repeated; and\r\nlittle progress is made in improvement by isolated or self-confident\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nIt would be a toilsome task, nor indeed would my limited information\r\nenable me, to enumerate all the discoveries and improvements in\r\nhusbandry which modern times have developed. I will mention one\r\nor two of the most prominent. There have been but few articles\r\nused among our farmers, for the most essential of all requisites,\r\n_manuring their lands_. _Dung_, which can be produced only in\r\nquantities inadequate to the demand for it, has been the universal\r\nand main reliance, _Lime_ is also generally esteemed of primary\r\nimportance. Both of these are estimable, without dispute; and yet\r\nit is now well known in Europe, and begins to be so here, that\r\n_the ashes of burnt clay_ constitute a manure which is superiour\r\nto them all, for every purpose to which they have been applied.\r\nClay is found every where in immense quantities, and can be cheaply\r\nconverted into ashes, and whole farms may be rapidly fertilized in\r\nplace of partial and protracted applications of more expensive and\r\nless attainable manures; it is fortunately best adapted for strong\r\nand clay soils, which thus afford renovations of their surfaces out\r\nof their own bowels. This account of so valuable an addition to our\r\nstock of manure, obtained from a material of little estimation,\r\nwalked over every day, and heedlessly neglected, will not, perhaps,\r\nbe believed by the generality of our farmers; and yet the most\r\ncelebrated agriculturists in England, Scotland, and Ireland are so\r\nconvinced of the fact, from actual experience, that it is maintained\r\nto be \"the most important discovery in agriculture which modern\r\ntimes have produced.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of salt to our fields as manure, is now under very\r\nextensive experiment. There is no doubt of its efficacy: but it\r\nrequires experience, as to quantity per acre, and the kinds of soil\r\nthe most suitable. This is not a new discovery; for its application\r\nto _land as manure_ has been known before, and at the time of, our\r\nblessed Saviour's appearance upon earth. In St. Luke's Gospel[1]\r\nit is said, \"_salt_ is good; but if the salt has lost its savour,\r\nwherewith shall it be seasoned? It is neither _fit for the land_\r\nnor _yet for the dunghill_; but men cast it out.\" Its uses, both for\r\ncattle and manure, can be traced through the writings of the most\r\neminent among the _Romans_, down to the most celebrated chymists and\r\nagriculturists of our own day. Where are our farmers to learn such\r\nfacts and discoveries? Not of themselves; for there are many who do\r\nnot read, and few go out of their way to try experiments. They can\r\nonly be taught by agricultural associations, wherein the experience\r\nof practical farmers, the information derived from books, and the\r\nassistance of scientific characters, are happily combined.\r\n\r\n  [1] Chap. xiv. 34, 35.\r\n\r\nThe spirit for agricultural improvement, and the formation of\r\nsocieties, has very much spread throughout the Union. Shall\r\nPennsylvania be behind her sister states in such associations? She\r\nis before them in many practical proofs of her good husbandry; but\r\nhas yet much to learn. Let us then promptly obey the call of our\r\nlegislature, and begin the great work by forming societies and\r\nrendering them efficient. Let us pride ourselves in our household\r\nmanufactures; and for this purpose let us invite the female branches\r\nof our families to join in our plan. _Without their aid_, we can\r\ndo nothing in such manufactures; _with it_, everything. Instead\r\nof foreign gewgaws and expensive finery, we may be independent\r\nin articles for household uses and our attire, and save the\r\nexpenditures which now go into the pockets of foreigners. Commerce\r\nis certainly essential to an agricultural country; but the extent\r\nof it should be no greater than our products will reach: when the\r\nbalance turns against us, our prosperity declines.\r\n\r\nYou know, gentlemen, that our farmers will be satisfied only by\r\nactual observations of practical proofs. We must have public\r\nmanifestations of improvement. The institution of cattle-shows\r\nshould be promoted. They would be useful as places of sale, or for\r\nthe exhibition of the best breeds, or for exposing for imitation\r\nor sale the best and greatest variety of household manufacture. On\r\nthese occasions, premiums, more honorary than costly, should be\r\ndistributed to successful candidates, either for such cattle or\r\nmanufactures, or for agricultural discoveries or improvements, or\r\nthe best execution of known practices. Emulation must be roused and\r\nencouraged, and the honourable pride of excelling must be fostered.\r\nSuch public exhibitions must be conducted by discreet and reputable\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nUnder such guidance and with suitable accompaniments of innocent\r\npleasure and amusement, they will make a much stronger impression\r\nthan any oral addresses or written communications. By these\r\nexhibitions, the emulation, excited in some neighbouring states\r\nhas improved their agriculture and increased their manufactures to\r\na degree almost incredible. Agricultural societies are extending\r\nto every quarter of the Union. Until very lately, there did not\r\nexist one to the southward of Pennsylvania, and she had but two,\r\n_to wit_, the Philadelphia Society, which has long continued its\r\nuseful labours and eminent zeal; and that of Blockley and Merior, in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Philadelphia. In the Eastern States, they are\r\nnumerous; and in New York, forty or fifty are recently formed and\r\nare making successful progress.\r\n\r\nI shall not enlarge further upon these topics, but will dismiss you\r\nwith the expression of a hope that you may be governed in all your\r\ndeliberations by the pure principles of justice; that by preserving\r\nyour minds entirely free from hate, from friendship, from anger,\r\nand from pity, they may be directed to such conclusions as may best\r\neffectuate the great purposes for which you are assembled, and that\r\nin clearing the innocent from unjust suspicion, and dragging the\r\nguilty to deserved punishment, you may promote the best interests\r\nof society, and secure the freedom and happiness of its individual\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS ON AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n(Concluded from last Number.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the cultivation of land by metayers may be unfavourable\r\nto its amelioration, still it may be easily imagined, that the\r\nsmaller products of every little farm will be greater, as each must\r\npossess both a garden and a poultry yard. Every field in Lombardy is\r\nencircled with a band of poplars, mulberries, oaks, &c., and they\r\nare often so thick that the eye can scarcely penetrate the rich\r\ngrowth of leaves. From the boughs, luxuriant vines hang in festoons,\r\nand present to the passing traveller a scene of rural beauty and\r\nenjoyment which he may search for in vain in other countries.\r\nThe shade of the trees does not injure the crops, such is the\r\ninvigorating effect of a humid soil and an Italian sky.\r\n\r\nOf the constant succession of crops we here know very little; indeed\r\nit is the result of experience alone. So much depends on climate,\r\nthat we imagine the rotation practised elsewhere can never afford\r\ncertain information to us. The largest quantity of the most valuable\r\nproduct, which may be taken from a spot of ground in any number of\r\nyears, is a problem whose solution is of the greatest importance. In\r\nPiedmont the rotation is generally as follow:\r\n\r\n     1st year, Indian corn, manured, Beans--hemp.\r\n\r\n     2d year, Wheat.\r\n\r\n     3d year, Clover, turned up after the first cutting and fallowed\r\n     by a fallow.\r\n\r\n     4th year, Wheat.\r\n\r\nThis rotation, says M. de Chateauvieux, is one of the most abundant,\r\nand may be pursued indefinitely, notwithstanding the recurrence of\r\nwheat, though perhaps the result may be atributed to the abundance\r\nof manure furnished by a meadow cut three times. After stating that\r\na farm of sixty arpents supported a family of eight or nine persons,\r\nwho kept twenty-two head of large cattle, of which two oxen and a\r\ncow are fattened every year, as well as one or two hogs, that it\r\ngave about one hundred and twenty-five dollars worth of silk, and\r\nfurnished more wine than could be consumed, that the preparatory\r\ncrop of Indian corn and beans almost subsisted the metayers, and\r\nthat nearly all the grain might be sold, as well as a great quantity\r\nof smaller products, he celebrates the industry and management of\r\nthe Piedmontese proprietors in the following terms: 'It will be easy\r\nfor you, after this, to conceive how Piedmont is perhaps, of all\r\ncountries, that where the economy and management of land is best\r\nunderstood, and the phenomenon of its great population and immense\r\nexportation of produce will thus be explained.'\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Placenza, cattle rather than grain\r\nconstitute the wealth of the farmer. The cows and oxen are\r\ndistinguished by immense horns and beautiful figures, and we believe\r\nthat our American race is in no way to be compared with them.--Their\r\norigin is said to be Hungarian; the males are noble animals, but the\r\ncows give little milk. To remedy this inconvenience, two thousand\r\ncows are imported from Switzerland, and the valuable qualities of\r\nthe animal are thus perpetuated. The cattle are almost universally\r\nof a slate-grey colour. The rotation of crops is here as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st year, Indian corn and hemp, manured.\r\n\r\n  2d year, Wheat.\r\n\r\n  3d year, Winter beans.\r\n\r\n  4th year, Wheat, manured.\r\n\r\n  5th year, Clover, ploughed after the first cutting.\r\n\r\n  6th year, Wheat.\r\n\r\nThis succession, however, can only be pursued in a rich soil, which\r\nis manured every three years. There is one article we beg leave to\r\nnotice particularly. We imagine that the winter bean might easily\r\nbe introduced among us, and with great advantage, as it is capable\r\nof supporting the cold of the severest winter. It is sown in the\r\nbeginning of September, and it must have considerable growth before\r\nautumn to resist the attacks of the cold. The stalk then perishes\r\nby the frost, but at the moment the genial warmth of the spring\r\nis felt, two or three new stalks arise, which bloom in the month\r\nof May, and the beans are fit to gather at the end of July. The\r\nmanagement of this important vegetable we give in the words of\r\nthe author. 'La culture est extrêmement simple; aprés a récolte\r\ndu blé fumé, on retourne la terre par un seul labour et on la\r\nlaisse émietter par l'influence de la saison. Aux premiers jours de\r\nSeptembre on séme les féves, soit en les enterrant á la charrue,\r\nsoit en les recoverant á la herse, soit enfin avec le semoire, qui\r\nles place par rangées, de manière à pouvoir au printemps les sarcler\r\navec la houe à cheval. Si on ne suit pas cette dernière méthode, il\r\nfaut les sarcler à la main, dans le courant d'avril.' The culture of\r\nthe winter bean is suited to argillaceous soils, and while it allows\r\nthe proper intervals between ploughing the ground and sowing wheat\r\nwhich succeeds, it is admirably calculated to maintain the fertility\r\nof the ground.\r\n\r\nThe plains which border on the Po, in the vicinity of Parma and\r\nLodi, support those fine animals, whose milk is converted into the\r\ncelebrated Parmesan cheese. The grass is here far more valuable than\r\nany crop of grain. In the summer the cows are housed and fed with\r\nthe green grass of the first and second mowings: that of the third\r\nis converted into hay. At the end of autumn the cows are allowed\r\nto pick up whatever may be left in the fields. These meadows are\r\nperhaps the most fertile on earth; they are generally mowed four\r\ntimes a year. The cheese is here never made from less than fifty\r\ncows, and as the farms are small, there is one common establishment,\r\nto which the milk is brought twice during the day; an account of it\r\nis kept by the cheesemaker and settled in cheese every six months.\r\nThe same plan has been introduced in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nIn the Milanese, the farms are larger than in other parts of Italy,\r\nbecause the culture of the grasses demands less care and labour than\r\nother branches of farming, and fewer advances. Irrigation is here\r\ncarried to such an extent, that every two or three arpents can be\r\ninundated by its own canal. The good quality of the grass, however,\r\nin time becomes deteriorated, other plants gradually spring up in\r\nthe place of the grasses; the sluices are then closed, and the\r\nground is ploughed for hemp; after which, and a crop of legumes,\r\noats, and wheat, it is again laid down in grass. A meadow will\r\ngenerally last fifteen years, and the course of harvests returns\r\nevery five. M. de Chateauvieux gives the following remarkable\r\noutline:\r\n\r\n     1st year, Hemp, followed by legumes.\r\n\r\n     2d year, Oats.\r\n\r\n     3d year, Wheat, followed by legumes.\r\n\r\n     4th year, Indian corn.\r\n\r\n     5th year, Wheat.\r\n\r\n     15th year, Natural meadow, dunged every 3 years, and mowed 4\r\n          times a year.\r\n     --          --\r\n     20 years  67\r\n     --        --\r\n\r\nOf these sixty-seven crops from the same ground there are sixty-one\r\nfor the use of animals, five for the sustenance of man, and only one\r\nfor his clothing. There is, perhaps, no country on the face of the\r\nearth which can boast such a proportion of agricultural products.\r\nTo obtain this result, the ground is manured, very profusely\r\nhowever, five times in twenty years, and it is a singular fact that\r\nthis manure is applied always to the grass and never to the grain.\r\n\r\nThe culture of rice occupies a part of Italy, and is a source of\r\ngreat profit to the owner of the soil. The difficulties in its\r\ncultivation are so trifling, that, contrary to the usual custom, the\r\nground is let out at a fixed rent of one hundred and sixty francs\r\nthe arpent; three crops are received every five years. As with us,\r\nthese rice grounds are most unhealthy, and the stagnant water which\r\ncovers them produces disease in all the surrounding country. The\r\nunfortunate peasant rarely escapes its deleterious effect, and the\r\ngovernment, sensible of this constant draft on human life, have\r\nprohibited the further extension of the culture of this grain.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular features in the physical character of\r\nItaly, is the constant elevation of the beds of rivers, particularly\r\nthe Arno and the Po, by means of depositions of earth and stones,\r\nbrought down by the heavy rains from the mountains.--This had become\r\nso alarming, that the raising of dykes yielded to a very ingenious\r\noperation called _Colmata_, by which the water of the river was\r\nallowed to overflow a certain space, and this very deposition,\r\nabout three or four inches in a year, made to raise the level of\r\nthe adjacent shores. But this process, which is fully described by\r\nSismondi, must necessarily have a limit. Embankments are resorted\r\nto, and in some places the bed of the Po is absolutely thirty feet\r\nabove the level country. The Po even now frequently overflows and\r\ndevastates its banks; the inhabitants, provided always for the\r\ncalamity which unfortunately is not unfrequent, take to their\r\nboats and wait till the inundation has subsided. There would seem\r\nto be little doubt that at some day not far distant, the whole\r\ndelta of the Po, or _Polesino_, as it is called, will become one\r\nwide and wretched marsh. Even now the roads are often impassable.\r\nFerara, consecrated by the genius of Ariosto and Tasso, will be\r\nextinguished, and Revenna, already fallen from its high honours,\r\nbe known only as the deserted capital of a potentate of the lower\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nM. de Chateauvieux, climbing the mountains which separate Tuscany\r\nfrom Modena, and leaving behind him the fertile plains of Lombardy,\r\nentered those lofty regions, where the earth does not produce\r\nsufficient sustenance for the inhabitants, who are employed with\r\ntheir flocks of goats and sheep, in constantly traversing the\r\nmountains in a manner somewhat similar to that of the Spanish\r\nshepherds. The author employs himself in describing the scenery of\r\nthe Corniche, and though it is perhaps among the finest in Europe,\r\nand he might have felt all its changeful beauty and sublimity, still\r\nwe think he is far more fortunate in his delineations of rural\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of Tuscany has been so fully and ably investigated\r\nby Sismondi,[2] that little was left to M. de Chateauvieux. The\r\nvalley of the Arno, in truth the only fertile part of the dukedom,\r\n(for the rest is composed of precipitous mountains, or that silent\r\nand hideous district the Maremma) stretches from Cortona to Pisa,\r\nand forms about one-sixth of its whole territory. The farms are\r\nvery small, being from three to six arpents, so that one pair of\r\noxen supplies the necessities of ten or twelve metayers, in the\r\nworking of their little plat of ground. They manifest, however,\r\ntheir extravagance in maintaining a horse, which may transport their\r\nproduce to market, and their wives and daughters to mass or a\r\nrustic ball.--The most general rotation of crops is here:\r\n\r\n  1st year, Indian corn, beans, peas, or other legumes dunged.\r\n\r\n  2d year,   Wheat.\r\n\r\n  3d year,   Winter beans.\r\n\r\n  4th year,  Wheat.\r\n\r\n  5th year, Clover, sown after the wheat, cut in the spring and\r\n        followed by _sorgho_.\r\n\r\n  [2] Tableau de l'agriculture Toscane, par J. C. L. Sismondi.\r\n\r\nThis _sorgho_ is a sort of parsnip, which is reduced into flour, of\r\nwhich they make a bad soup and a poor polente. The ground is manured\r\nonly once in five years, a circumstance which abundantly proves\r\nthe richness of this deep alluvial soil. Notwithstanding all this\r\nfertility and a cultivation which resembles rather that of a garden,\r\nthan a farm, the country does not produce enough to resist the\r\neffects of a bad year. The metayers live with the greatest economy,\r\nand though their cottages are built with a taste which seems\r\nindigenous to the country, the interior exhibits a total absence of\r\nall the conveniences of life, and supplies but a frugal subsistence.\r\nSuch is the view which M. de Chateauvieux has taken. But in our\r\nopinion the peasantry of Tuscany under all circumstances, are not\r\nonly more neat in their persons, but better clothed, and apparently\r\nenjoying more happiness, than that of any other district in Italy.\r\nThere can be little doubt, that all this distress and privation\r\narises from the system of the metayers; a system which, deriving\r\nits existence from the feudal state, is equally to be deprecated,\r\nwhether we consider the political character of the community or\r\nthe individual happiness of its members. The man who has no other\r\npossession than his industry, and who cannot hope to change his\r\nsituation, can never have such a stake in the state, as to render\r\nhim either an intelligent or valuable member of it. On the other\r\nhand, the metayer, bound to furnish half the seed and to divide and\r\nsell the produce, pretty generally consumes one year the fruits of\r\nthe last; or if there be a surplus, how is it to be invested? There\r\nwould seem to be no other mode, than in the sticks which he is bound\r\nto supply, for the support of the vines, for the landlord provides\r\nthe stock and repairs the house. He then can only lay up his money\r\nin his chest, or spend it on his pleasures. Thus the end of a year\r\nfinds him no better off than at its commencement, for want of such\r\nan interest in the soil, as would secure him from the effects of his\r\nnegligence and indifference in its cultivation.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this part of Italy, we ought to mention a subject\r\nwhich is of some little importance; the manufacture of straw hats,\r\nwhich has just commenced in our country. It is doubtless a most\r\nprofitable exertion of industry. The raw material costs nothing,\r\nand M. de Chateauvieux informs us that this branch annually amounts\r\nto three millions (we presume) of francs. The straw is of beardless\r\nwheat, cut before it is ripe, and whose vegetation has been thinned\r\n(étiolée) by the sterility of the soil. This soil is chosen among\r\ncalcareous hills; it is never manured, and the grain is sown very\r\nthick. The women who are employed in making the Leghorn hats, earn\r\nfrom about thirty to forty cents per day, no trifling sum in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Maremma or country of the Malaria forms the third district,\r\nextending from Leghorn to Terracina, and from the sea to the\r\nmountains, and having a width of twenty-five or thirty miles. M.\r\nde Chateauvieux speaks of this singular country in the following\r\nterms: 'Le ciel reste également pur, la verdure aussi fraiche,\r\nl'air aussi calme; la sérénité de cet aspect semble devoir inspirer\r\nune entiére confiance, et je ne saurais cependant vous exprimer l'\r\nespèce d'effroi que l'on éprauve malgré soi en respirant cet air\r\nà la fois si suave et si funeste.' A country so very singular in\r\nits character would necessarily require a very peculiar system of\r\nmanagement. Our author developes this system in a visit he made to a\r\ndomain called Campo Morto, in the most deserted part of the Maremma.\r\nHere was a Faltore, charged with the administration of the farm. The\r\nwhole Maremma of Rome is in the hands of eighty proprietors, who are\r\ncalled mercanti de' tenuti, and reside as well as their Fattori in\r\nthe city.--On this farm there were four hundred horses, of which,\r\none hundred were broken; two thousand hogs, which ran in the woods\r\nand fed on the acorns; some hundreds of cows, who give no other\r\nrevenue than the sale of the calves, which is estimated at about\r\neight dollars each cow; one hundred oxen used to the plough, and\r\nabout four thousand sheep. The rent of this farm was about eighteen\r\nfrancs the arpent of cultivated land, amounting in all to about\r\n$22,000. The annual profit was about $5000, besides interest at five\r\nper cent. on the capital of the flocks.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this establishment there was a vast _casale_ or\r\nfarm house, destitute of furniture and inhabited but a very few\r\ndays in the year.--Every thing around breathed the most perfect\r\ndesolation; all was vast and silent. The harvest had just commenced\r\nand a thousand labourers, of whom one half were women, had descended\r\nfrom the mountains to gain a small pittance during a few days, by\r\nreaping the rich grain of six hundred and sixty arpents for the\r\nlordly proprietor, and if they did not perish at their toil, to go\r\nback after having respired the elements of a miserable death. Some\r\ndays had elapsed since the harvest began, and only two labourers had\r\nbeen attacked by the fever of the Malaria; every day would, however,\r\nincrease the number, till at the completion of their task, scarcely\r\nhalf of them would remain. 'What then becomes of these unfortunate\r\npeople?' said M. de Chateauvieux. 'They get a piece of bread and\r\nare sent off,' was the inhuman reply,--'But where do they go to?'\r\n'To the mountains; some stop on the road, some die, others get home\r\nalmost expiring with misery and famine, only to follow the same life\r\nnext year.'\r\n\r\nThe Malaria is one of those singular phenomena whose origin has\r\nbaffled every effort at discovery, and the remedy for which has\r\nnever yet been ascertained. Attempts have been made to cultivate\r\nthe soil of the Maremma, and colonies were established within its\r\ncircuit, but the resistless scythe of sure and silent death swept\r\naway the presumptuous intruders.--During half of the year, a few\r\nmiserable beings, armed with lances and clothed in skins, the\r\nliving images of death, wander over these devoted plains with their\r\nflocks; and if accident should delay their return to the mountains,\r\nfall certain victims to this fatal disease. Immense numbers of\r\nsheep, cows, horses, and goats find a subsistence on these wastes\r\nand supply the markets of Rome and the Val d'Arno. The soil is\r\nextremely steril; the whiteness of the pure argil being only alloyed\r\nby a mixture of sulphur, which is produced in great profusion.\r\nThe cause of the Malaria, as we before remarked, has escaped all\r\nthe investigations of science; it still remains a mystery no less\r\nprofound, than its effects are dreadful. Some have supposed it to\r\narise from the low pools of stagnant waters, which collect on the\r\nface of the Maremma; but the disease prevails on the heights of\r\nRadiocofani and within the lofty precincts of Volterra.\r\n\r\nSome have supposed that the disease was caused by exposure to the\r\nsudden changes of temperature at the going down of the sun.[3]\r\nThis is supported, it is true, by the very weighty face related\r\nby de Bonsteten in his _Voyage au Latium_, of a man who resided\r\nat Ardea sixteen years without being indisposed. But we doubt\r\nwhether any solution that has ever been proposed was so perfectly\r\nridiculous or so completely destitute of foundation. Do the people\r\nthen die in the towns of this disease, where we know it to be a\r\ncustom not to go out after dark, of mere exposure to a changing\r\natmosphere? A short distance from the Porta del Popolo at Rome are\r\ntwo villas, one on each side of a small lane, but both situated on\r\nhigh ground. We were informed that during the summer season, a man\r\nwould run very imminent danger of death in sleeping in one, while\r\nhe might remain in the other with perfect impunity. How is this\r\nto be reconciled with the doctrine that the disease caused by the\r\nMalaria is nothing but fever and ague, brought on by exposure? The\r\ntruth is, this dreadful enemy every year makes further inroads; no\r\nlonger satisfied with pursuing the wretched thousands of enervated\r\nlabourers and shepherds, who at evening crowd for safety into\r\nRome, it is advancing into the city in the midst of darkness, and\r\nspreading from the Porta del Popolo, on the one side, and from the\r\nPalatine on the other, up the sides of the Quirinal. In 1791, says\r\nM. de Chateauvieux, Rome had a population of 160,000; at the time of\r\nthis visit, it numbered only 100,000, of whom more than 10,000 were\r\ngardeners, shepherds, and vine-dressers. Four years afterwards we\r\nheard it computed at from 80 to 90,000. Undoubtedly political events\r\nhave had no small effect in diminishing the number of inhabitants;\r\nbut still we believe the Malaria must have had a no less powerful\r\ninfluence. Annually it roams over the finest villas without the\r\nwalls, and ravages large districts of the town within; and neither\r\nthe magnificence of the villa Borghese, nor the luxuriant beauty\r\nand towering pines of Doria Pamfili, can resist the assaults of\r\nthis silent and deadly foe. Time seems to hold its mantle over the\r\nqueen of cities, and to prepare by a fate as extraordinary as its\r\nformer history, to blot it out from the admiration of mortals.\r\nEncompassed already by the awful stillness of a desolate waste,\r\nonce filled up with sixty towns, which the antiquarian in vain\r\nattempts to trace, perhaps her own site may be hereafter unknown;\r\nand some future traveller may boast with enthusiasm of having once\r\nagain penetrated its deserted streets, of having visited the spot\r\nenobled by the heroic virtue of Junius Brutus, or the eloquence and\r\nwisdom of Cato the censor. But we must leave a subject, on which we\r\ncould dwell still longer with delight, and conclude our notice of a\r\nbook, of which we would hope our readers have received a favourable\r\nimpression. The subject of the work is not only important in itself,\r\nbut most interesting to us. Italy is essentially an agricultural\r\ncountry; she is neither a manufacturing nor a commercial state.\r\nIt is by her agriculture, that she supports more than 17,000,000\r\nof inhabitants, or about 1237 to a square league; a population\r\nfar superiour to that of France or England. It is her agriculture\r\nwhich laid the foundations of those splendid cities which crowd her\r\nplains; it is her agriculture, which, should it ever be protected\r\nby an enlightened government, will again yield nourishment to the\r\nprinciples of liberty, and raise her to a level with the most\r\nrespectable nations of Europe. M. de Chateauvieux has devoted\r\nhimself to the illustration of this noble subject, and we are\r\nconfident that his work will not only afford many valuable hints\r\nto the practical farmer, but some lessons to our statesmen, in any\r\nfuture attempts which may be made to elevate manufactures at the\r\nexpense of the most dear and invaluable interests in our country.\r\n\r\n  [3] See Edinburgh Review for March, 1817, p. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Edinburgh Farmer's Magazine.\r\n\r\nPARMESAN CHEESE DAIRY.\r\n\r\nFrom a Journey in Carniola, &c. by W. A. Cadell, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On the 14th April (1818,) I went to see a large cheese dairy, 3\r\nmiles from Milan, one of the dairies at which that kind of cheese,\r\ncalled in commerce _Parmesan_, is made. It is called in Italy,\r\n_Formaggio di grana_, because it is commonly used in a granular\r\nform, being grated, and brought to table to be eaten with soup. Much\r\nof this cheese is also made near Lodi and Pavia.\r\n\r\nThe word _Formaggio_ is from _Formaticum_, which signifies, in the\r\nLatin of the middle ages, cheese prepared in a form.\r\n\r\nThe cheese is made in the morning before sunrise.\r\n\r\nThe morning's milk, and that of the preceding evening, are put into\r\na large brass vessel, five feet in height, narrow at bottom, and\r\nwidening out like a trumpet to three feet diameter at top. This\r\nvessel is placed over a fire, which is sunk in the ground, and the\r\nvessel can be removed from the fire by a crane.\r\n\r\nWhen the milk is heated, runnet, in form of paste, is put in, and a\r\nlittle saffron, to give the cheese the yellow colour.\r\n\r\nWhen the coagulation has taken place, the copper is taken off the\r\nfire, the curd is taken out in a cloth, and put within a broad\r\nwooded hoop, the sides of which are as high as the cheese is\r\nintended to be. This hoop can be straitened by means of a rope. A\r\nboard is placed on the top of the cheese, and a small weight on the\r\nboard. The cheese is not cut into a press.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the cheese is taken to the salting room, and two cheeses\r\nare placed together, one above the other, with broad hoops tightened\r\nround them. Much salt is laid on the top of the uppermost cheese;\r\nthe salt dissolves, and the brine filters through the cheeses.\r\n\r\nThe cheeses are shifted from one place to another all along the\r\nbenches of the salting room, and are beaten with a flat piece of\r\nwood, cut with straight-lined furrows intersecting each other.\r\n\r\nThe cheese is next taken to the magazine, where each cheese is\r\nplaced on a shelf.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the cheese are painted with a mixture of litmus,\r\notherwise called _tournesol_, and oil, to give them the purple\r\ncolour. The tournesol is a plant collected in the south of France.\r\n\r\nThe cheeses are set on the shelf in the same order in which they\r\nwere made; and the cheeses of each month are placed together.\r\n\r\nThose of the month of October and of May are the best, and bear\r\nthe highest price. The best cheeses can be kept longest, and are\r\nimproved by keeping for some years.\r\n\r\nThere was an October cheese which had been kept five years, and was\r\nto be sent to the emperor.\r\n\r\nAfter the great cheese is made, the liquid in the copper is again\r\nheated over the fire, and curd is collected from it to make small\r\ncheeses, called _Mascarla_.\r\n\r\nThe number of cows kept for making cheese in this dairy is\r\neighty.--They are always in the house in winter, and at the present\r\nseason of the year. They are fed upon grass all the year, except\r\nperhaps in December. The house in which they are kept is not above\r\nnine feet high to the ceiling. They are not kept very clean. In\r\nsummer, they go out to the field to feed during the day.\r\n\r\nThe cows are of a dark colour, and are brought from Switzerland,\r\nwhich is found more profitable than rearing them in this country.\r\nThe bull is also Swiss, and fourteen months old.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 2000 head of cattle pass the Mount St. Gothard\r\nevery year coming from Switzerland into Italy. Considerable fairs\r\nfor the sale of Swiss cattle are held at Lugano.\r\n\r\nThe evening's milk is put in flat copper vessels, three feet in\r\ndiameter, in order to collect the cream.\r\n\r\nThere is an ice-house in the dairy, for the purpose of supplying ice\r\nfor cooling the cream which is put into the churn. This, they find,\r\nfacilitates the making of butter at certain periods of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the farm-yard is an inscription, commemorating the visit paid to\r\nthis dairy by the Austrian emperor and the archdukes, two years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILD RICE.\r\n\r\nFrom the New York Statesman.\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract of a letter, dated Canandaigua, July, 1820.\r\n\r\nI saw for the first time in the Seneca river at Montezuma, the\r\naquatic plant called wild rice, or folle arvine. It grows all over\r\nthe west and north; and wherever it flourishes, myriads of waterfowl\r\nare attracted to it, and derive their chief support and exquisite\r\nflavour from its alimentary qualities. In the lakes and rivers\r\nadjoining Montezuma, thousands of wild geese and ducks of all kinds\r\ncongregate at the proper season for food, except the canvas back\r\nduck, or anas valsineria of Wilson, which derives its name from a\r\nwater plant called valsineria, on the roots of which it feeds, and\r\nwhich Wilson states to be a fresh water vegetable, that grows in\r\nsome parts of the Hudson and Delaware, and in most of the rivers\r\nthat fall into the Chesapeake.\r\n\r\nSome difficulty has occurred not only about the botanical name, but\r\nalso about the botanical character of the wild rice, or wild oats.\r\nThe confusion of nomenclature has arisen from Linnæus himself. In\r\nhis Species Plantarum, he has denominated it zezania aquatica, and\r\nin his mantisa, zezania palustris--and it has been called by other\r\nbotanists, zezania claurlosa. I shall prefer the first name as\r\nmost characteristic. It has been well described by Mr. Lambert, as\r\nzezania panicula inferne racemosa superne spicata. Pursh represents\r\nit as a perennial plant. Nuttall and Michaux are silent on this\r\npoint, and Eaton says it is an annual, in which opinion I concur.\r\n\r\nMr. Lambert, in a communication in the 7th volume of the\r\nTransactions of the Linnæan Society of London, has given a figure\r\nof this plant as growing at Spring Grove, the seat of sir Joseph\r\nBanks, in England. It appears that sir Joseph received some of the\r\nseed gathered in a lake, in Canada, and put it in jars of water. It\r\nwas sown in a pond at Spring Grove, where he has a great quantity of\r\nthe plant, growing annually, ripening its seeds extremely well in\r\nautumn, and sowing itself round the edges.\r\n\r\nBy what I can learn, this same plant grows in Lake George, and Lake\r\nChamplain, and in all the western lakes. It produces seed in some\r\nplaces in September, and in others in October. It grows in shallow\r\nwater, and, sometimes to the height of eight feet. Some of the\r\nwestern Indians derive their principal support from it. The grain\r\nit bears is superior to the common rice, and if cut before ripe, it\r\nmakes excellent fodder, embracing the advantages of hay and oats.\r\nMr. Lambert's figure of the plant in the Linnæan Transactions is\r\naccurate, and exactly resembles the one growing in the Seneca River.\r\nIts productiveness may be inferred from the food it furnishes to\r\nthousands of human beings, and to myriads of aquatic animals. From\r\nthe success of the experiments of Sir Joseph Banks, it is highly\r\nprobable that it will grow in any part of this country and Great\r\nBritain; and if so, may it not be considered as a good substitute\r\nfor the oryza sativa, or common rice. It is well known that the\r\nlatter furnishes more subsistence to the human race than any\r\nother plant. Pursh mentions a grass which he calls the oryzopsis\r\nasperifolia, which he observed on the broad mountains of this\r\ncountry, and which he says contains large seeds, that produce the\r\nfinest flour. Perhaps this species of oryzopsis, although generally\r\ndifferent, bears the same relation to z aquatica in its importance\r\nand place of growth, as the mountain rice of India does to the\r\ncommon rice of that region. At all events, the more I see of this\r\ncountry, the more I am convinced of its vast ability to support the\r\nhuman species and of the propriety of calling its latent powers into\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON SEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong plants, as among animals, there are different breeds to be\r\nfound, some mean, some middling, and some quite superior. The\r\nintelligent grazier, or raiser of cattle of every sort, selects the\r\nfinest animals he can find for breeders of his future stock; and\r\nin this way he experiences a wonderful improvement in its value,\r\nwhether the stock be of horses, neat cattle, sheep, or swine. The\r\nsame precaution should be observed by the agriculturist in the\r\nselection of the seeds of different plants which he cultivates--he\r\nshould constantly select his seeds from the finest breeds of plants\r\nof every kind. In some cases such selections are attended with more\r\ntrouble than with others, but in all cases it is a matter of the\r\nutmost importance in the improvement of crops. Some general rules\r\nfor such selections shall now be pointed out.\r\n\r\nFor _Indian corn_.--Search for such stalks as bear two ears, at\r\nleast, and take the largest ear of each stalk for seed, rejecting\r\nthe grains on both ends. Pursuing this practice will, in a few\r\nyears, increase the corn crop at least one third.\r\n\r\n_Wheat, Rye, Barley, &c._--Search among the sheaves for the\r\nlargest and best filled heads.--Sow the grains taken from these by\r\nthemselves, and when the product is sufficient for seed, sow of\r\nthis selected stock only. Repeat the selection about every six years.\r\n\r\n_Flax, Hemp, &c._--At the time of pulling the crop, select the\r\nlongest stalks to be found, sow the seed of these separately, and\r\nthe product will probably afford seed sufficient for the next year's\r\nsowing. Repeat this, as before mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Carrots, Beets, Turnips, &c._--Make yearly selections of the\r\nlargest and most perfect roots, for bearing a supply of seed for the\r\nensuing year.\r\n\r\n_Pumpkins, Squashes, &c._--Select such plants as bear the greatest\r\n_number_ or the greatest _quantity_ of pumpkins, or squashes,\r\n&c.--take the _largest_ of the produce of each plant, and\r\nafter opening them, the quality for _sweetness_ of each can be\r\nascertained. Select your seeds for the next year's crop, from the\r\nsweetest of the collection.\r\n\r\n_Cabbages._--Preserve the stalks for seed, which bore the largest\r\nand finest heads, or leaves, according to the sort of cabbage.\r\n\r\n_Apples, Pears, &c._--No selections from the seeds of these, will\r\ninsure the same sorts of fruit as those from whence the seeds\r\nwere taken. The finest of these fruits are only to be obtained by\r\ningrafting. It is however said, that by taking the seeds only from\r\nthe south sides of such apples or pears, as grow on the finest of\r\nthese fruit trees, varieties of young trees will be afforded from\r\nsuch seeds nearly equal to those from whence the seeds were taken.\r\n\r\n_Peaches, Plums, &c._--Make your selections from such trees as bear\r\nthe finest fruit, and from that growing on the south side of the\r\ntrees. If you wish to make the young stock of fruit earlier than\r\nthat of the parent tree, make your selections of such peaches or\r\nplums as ripen first, and these will always be found on the south\r\nside of the tree.\r\n\r\nFor preserving the germinative power of seeds, let them be mixed\r\nwith a due proportion of sugar.\r\n\r\nThere is, in most cases, perhaps in all, a very essential advantage\r\nto be derived from a change of seeds, or bringing them from one\r\npart of the world to be sown in another. Sufficient attention has\r\nnot, however, been paid to this matter to enable us to ascertain\r\nwhat changes prove most beneficial; but in making them, regard\r\nmust doubtless be had that the seeds be taken from climates not\r\ntoo widely dissimilar. In bringing southern seeds to be sown in\r\nnortherly climates, the danger is, that they will want sufficient\r\ntime for ripening, and in pursuing the reverse of this, the crop may\r\nripen so early as to be, on that account, lessened in its products.\r\n\r\nIn raising seeds of plants of which there are different species,\r\nit is essential that the seed plants be placed so far apart as to\r\npreclude any danger of the pollen of the one being carried by the\r\nwinds to the other; for if an intermixture of breeds take place,\r\na degeneracy of the plants must ensue, by mixing the valuable\r\nqualities of each. In the _Brascia_ tribe, for instance, there\r\nis one species denominated cabbages, of many varieties, and are\r\nvaluable for their heads or leaves; another species is the common\r\nturnip, of several varieties, and valuable for its bulbous root;\r\nand another is the Swedish turnip or Ruta Baga, whose principle\r\nexcellence is its bulbous stalk. The effect, therefore, of an\r\nadmixture of these plants, must be a diminution of the bulbs of the\r\ntwo latter, and an increase of foliage, while the cabbages would\r\nlessen in the heads and leaves, with a proportionate augmentation of\r\nstalk and roots.\r\n\r\n  [_Plough Boy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLKHAM SHEEP-SHEARING, (ENG.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis festival, established by T. W. Coke, Esq. forty-three years\r\nago, commenced on 10th July last.--Among the company present\r\nthis year were, his Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex, Princes\r\nPotemkin and Trabetzkoy, (Russia,) the Marquis of Downshire, Earl\r\nof Albemarle; Lords Waterpark, Erskine, Anson, Ebrington, Lynedock,\r\nDelaware;--Hon. Mr. Keppel, Hon. Geo. Walpole, Hon. Gen. Fitzroy,\r\nHon. Mr. Thellison, Sir John Sinclair, Bart. Sir Wm. Hoste, Bart. T.\r\nW. Coke, jr. Esq. M. P.; G. W. Hall, Esq. Thos. Gay, Esq. (Herts,)\r\nRobert Patterson, Esq. (Baltimore,) C. Deering, Esq. (Middlesex,)\r\nMons. Petit, Esq. (Paris,) Thos. B. Beevor, Esq. J. Ellman, Esq.\r\n(Sussex,) and many eminent agriculturists from Norfolk, Suffolk,\r\nand various parts of the kingdom. This festival, instituted for the\r\nimprovement of agriculture, assumes, at every anniversary, a greater\r\ndegree of interest and importance.\r\n\r\nAmong the sheep exhibited there was an Arabian, and one from New\r\nZealand; likewise a half-bred Zealand lamb, from a Southdown ewe.\r\nThe Arabian sheep is a large animal, covered with a close coat of\r\nhair, like our pointer dogs. The colour of the one exhibited was\r\nwhite, with a black head and neck. The tail is very singularly\r\nformed--a large piece of loose flesh projects from the rump, above\r\nwhich grows a tail, about four inches in length, exactly resembling\r\nthat of a young pig; the sheep has also a large pouch under the jaw.\r\n\r\nA simple but most effectual method of preventing rats and mice from\r\ninjuring corn stalks, was recommended by Mr. Gibbs. of Quarles, a\r\ntenant to Mr. Coke. The cost is not more than 6s. or 7s. per stack;\r\nand it has been found by several gentlemen who have made the trial,\r\nto be a complete bar to the depredations of those destructive\r\nvermin. The stack is cut round, and merely plastered with common\r\nlime and hair, about three feet high; and when properly done, it\r\nwill be found that no vermin can possibly make their way into the\r\nstacks.\r\n\r\nMr. Coke pronounced the _grubber_ to be one of the most useful\r\nimplements upon his farm, and pointed out its superiority over the\r\nscarifier, which cuts the roots of the weeds in pieces, and thereby\r\nmultiplies them; instead of which the grubber forces them up in an\r\nentire state, and even their finest fibres are destroyed. Alluding\r\nto his own farms as a proof of what a better mode of husbandry would\r\neffect, Mr. Coke observed, with respect to what was frequently said\r\nof the injury accruing from the introduction of machinery, that he\r\nemployed more hands with the machinery than he could any other way.\r\nOf the mode of _driling_, he said, it should be from north to south,\r\ninstead of from east to west. This might appear of trivial moment,\r\nbut he could assert that it was worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nAbout 500 persons each day sat down to dinner in the noble mansion;\r\nwhen a scene of hilarity and cheerfulness, intermixed with valuable\r\ninformation from the gentlemen whose healths were drank, was\r\nexhibited. Mr. Coke, at the close of the meeting on Wednesday\r\nevening, delivered the prizes to the successful candidates in the\r\nvarious classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL MEMORANDA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flax for Cambrics._--The culture of this species of flax is an\r\nobject of great importance to every farmer.--The produce of a\r\nsingle acre has been known to bring in Flanders upwards of $380.\r\nIt requires a deep and rich soil, and must be sticked or supported\r\nnearly as peas, as it grows twice as high as the ordinary flax; but\r\nthe labour attending this is amply compensated by the produce.\r\n\r\n_Hops._--The essential oil of hops, obtained by distillation, and\r\nafterwards mixed with a small quantity of sugar, is found to be the\r\nbest way of using that plant in brewing, and the most effectual\r\nmethod of preserving it for years.\r\n\r\n_Squashes._--It has been asserted, as the result of an accidental\r\nexperiment, that squashes sown in the Fall will survive the frosts\r\nof winter and spring, and will ripen much earlier than any which can\r\nbe raised by sowing in the spring. Those sown in the spring, and\r\nthose sown in the fall, were, in the case alluded to, exposed to a\r\nsevere frost; the former were killed, while the latter survived. It\r\nmay be worth a more satisfactory experiment. The earliest salads, we\r\nknow, are grown in this way. The same has been said of a species of\r\nbeans, and even potatoes.\r\n\r\n_A Hint for Farmers._--For 3 or 4 years past Hemp and Canary Seed\r\nhave sold, on an average, at 5 and 6 dolls. per bushel, in this\r\ncity; and within the last twelve months the last mentioned seed\r\n(Canary) has been sold as high as 12 dols. per bushel.--The above\r\nseeds are as easily raised in this country as wheat--why then should\r\nwe depend on Europe for our supply, while wheat is selling for\r\nseventy cents per bushel?\r\n\r\n  [_E. Post._\r\n\r\n_Salt as a Manure._--In the history of the cocoa nut tree, by M.\r\nle Goux, the author tells us that the inhabitants of those parts\r\nof Hindostan and China, which border on the sea coast, sprinkle\r\ntheir rice fields with sea water, and use no other manure; and that\r\nin the interior of these countries, they sprinkle the lands with\r\nsalt before they are tilled, a practice which has been followed for\r\nages with the greatest advantage. Park says, he was informed by a\r\ngentleman in England, who had spent many years in making experiments\r\non the employment of salt in Agriculture, \"that one bushel to an\r\nacre makes land always more productive; but that a larger quantity\r\nwould, for two or three years afterwards, render it actually\r\nsterile.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GINSENG.\r\n\r\nExtract from the New Monthly Magazine, on the \"American Trade with\r\nChina.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove all, a remarkable production deserves to be mentioned here,\r\nwhich grows in America itself, and is almost peculiar to the United\r\nStates; a production which is almost wholly unknown in Europe, but\r\nhas been in use in China from time immemorial, and is held there\r\nin extraordinary esteem. This is the root Panax quinquefolia, or\r\nGinseng. The Chinese writers call this plant a precious gift of\r\nnature, sweeter than honey and the honey comb, more valuable than\r\nfine gold, and jewels, and pearls, a glorious gift of Heaven,\r\nbestowed by the gods upon mortals for their happiness, and their\r\nenjoyment on earth. Placed on a par with the philosopher's stone,\r\nit is called the food of immortality, and it passes among the\r\npriests and physicians for a universal remedy, wholesome for all\r\nweakness of the frail body, applicable to all diseases; nay, it is\r\neven said to prolong life, invigorating the nerves, strengthening\r\nthe understanding, cheering the soul, soothing the mind, taming the\r\nwild passions, and bestowing inexhaustible delights upon our mortal\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe reigning dynasty of the Mantchews, in China, were proud that\r\nNature produced this wonderful root, with such magical powers, in\r\ntheir original country; for it was found in Chinese Mogul Tartary;\r\nbut sparingly scattered in certain places and districts. Here it\r\nwas considered as one of the regalia of the crown, only the emperor\r\nhad the right to have it gathered, and guards were posted at the\r\nplaces where it grew, that no one might presume to take openly, or\r\nby stealth, what was for the emperor alone. How fortunate was it for\r\nthe Americans, that they accidentally discovered, not very long ago,\r\nthat this root, so highly esteemed in China, and paid for there with\r\nits weight in gold, which it had been always supposed was only to be\r\nfound in Tartary, as the Chinese had always boasted, was indigenous\r\nin the United States, and might be there collected in far greater\r\nabundance than in China, hitherto the only country where it was\r\nknown to grow.\r\n\r\nIt grows in the United States, in the whole of the immense tract\r\nfrom the Canadian Lakes to Georgia; is found even in the northern\r\nstates of New York and Pennsylvania, and flourishes in Virginia and\r\nthe two Carolinas. Nature has spread it here, particularly in the\r\ntract between the Alleghany mountains and the sea, and it thrives\r\nespecially where the mountains take a southwesterly direction. It\r\nloves a fertile soil, and cool shady spots, on the declivity of the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nWhile Europe produces nothing which it can offer to the Chinese in\r\nexchange for their productions, America possesses in this remarkable\r\nplant an article peculiarly its own, which is, above all others,\r\nproper for the trade with China.\r\n\r\nMany of your readers may, perhaps, be curious to be better\r\nacquainted with a plant so esteemed by the great Chinese Mandarins,\r\nand in the Harems.\r\n\r\nThe stalk of this plant, which attains the height of about a foot\r\nfrom the ground, is of a dark red. It is adorned with elliptical\r\nleaves, three of which always grow together, and each of which is\r\nagain divided into five little leaves. On account of the symbolical\r\nmeaning attached to the numbers three and five, which these leaves\r\npresent to the eye, the plant obtained, in ancient times, in China,\r\nthe character of particular sacredness. The growth of this singular\r\nplant is extremely slow, but then it attains an age unusual in\r\nplants of this kind; when it has stood fifteen years or more, the\r\nroot it not yet an inch in diameter. Every year the stalk makes at\r\nthe upper part of the root, at each new shoot, marks, which show\r\nby their number the age of the plant. The root itself is of an\r\nelliptical form, and commonly consists only of one piece. The plant\r\nbears but a few seeds; two or three grains are all that can be\r\ngathered from one stem; these are of a bright red colour, in shape\r\nand size like those that may be collected from the honeysuckle. They\r\nripen in America, in the latter half of the month of September, and\r\ntheir taste is more aromatic than that of the root itself, but less\r\nbitter.\r\n\r\nIn China the greatest care is taken in gathering this valuable\r\nroot. It is not done till it has attained the highest perfection\r\nand maturity: this is during the autumn and winter. In America they\r\nlong committed, from ignorance and inattention, the great fault of\r\ncollecting the root from the spring to the first frost. As it is\r\nalways soft and watery at this season, it naturally shrunk together\r\nin drying, became very hard, and lost not only in weight but in\r\ngoodness. This mistake is still committed in some parts of the\r\nUnited States, where the inhabitants make the collecting of the root\r\nonly an occasional object; and when they are hunting or travelling,\r\ndig up the plant at all seasons when they happen to meet with it.\r\nBut by this they deprive the ground of a valuable production, which\r\nwould be far more valuable if it were tended and cultivated with due\r\ncare. Though the Ginseng roots thus collected by ignorant persons\r\ndo not fetch in China the high prices which are given for such as\r\nhave attained their proper maturity, yet the demand for them is not\r\nthe less brisk. The American merchants in the interior purchase\r\nlarge quantities by the pound, or the hundred weight, of the country\r\npeople, who employ themselves in collecting and digging this root,\r\nand gain by exporting it to China, about one hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nBut the profit is incomparably greater when Ginseng roots, perfectly\r\nripe, and carefully gathered at the proper time, are brought to\r\nMacao or China. The Americans begin to be more sensible of this\r\nadvantage, in proportion as the intercourse with China becomes more\r\nactive. They have made themselves better acquainted with the nature\r\nof the plant, and the taste of the Chinese; employ greater care in\r\ngathering, and acquire more skill in digging it. One man can gather\r\nabout eight or nine pounds daily. Hence the quantity of this article\r\nexported from the United States increases at the same time that its\r\nquality improves; and the trade with Ginseng roots in the Chinese\r\nmarkets continues to become more and more profitable to America. The\r\nexportation already amounts to at least 500 cwt. annually.\r\n\r\nIn China they understand the art of preparing the Ginseng, in such a\r\nmanner, that it appears semi-transparent: in this case a much higher\r\nvalue is set upon it. In America they have also learnt this art, and\r\nthe process employed is very simple.--The merchants in the American\r\ncommercial towns, purchase the roots so prepared, and rendered\r\npartly transparent, at six or seven piasters apiece; and sell them\r\nin China, according to the quality, at from fifty to a hundred\r\npiasters apiece. Even in Louisiana and Kentucky, they carry on this\r\nextremely profitable export trade to China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Easton, (Md.) Gazette, in treating of the importance of\r\nEducation, and the advantages, under a republican government,\r\nof close application to study, concludes with the following\r\ncharacteristic allusions:\r\n\r\nWho was Mr. Wirt, the present Attorney General of the U. States? A\r\npoor boy of our state; of the village of Bladensburgh.--What has\r\ngiven him one of the first stations in the country, with a handsome\r\nincome? Good education, laborious study and application, and\r\nconsequent knowledge.\r\n\r\nWho was William Pinkney? A poor boy of Annapolis. What has learning\r\nmade him? The first lawyer; the most celebrated advocate of our\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWho was James Monroe? The son of a bricklayer in the town of\r\nCambridge, in Dorset. Who is James Monroe? The President of these\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEducation is the solid granite pedestal of the column of his\r\nfame, supporting a shaft of the most towering attitude, whose\r\nCorinthian capital is high above the clouds. How emphatically, in\r\nthis instance, has wisdom, founded on good education, and matured\r\nby intense study and application, proved herself to be power, with\r\nstation, and honours, and wealth, following in her train. Why\r\nthen should not a son of one of our bricklayers, or hatters, or\r\ntailors, or cabinet makers, become a future President of the United\r\nStates?--The same path is open to them: true, it winds up the sides\r\nof a steep and rugged mountain; and the elevated pinnacle is not\r\nto be gained without setting out aright, with the earliest and\r\nbest discipline of good schools, and the severest and most immense\r\nmental labour--but the prize is well worth the boldest, the highest\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nWill it be said that Nature made these men of her best materials?\r\nno such thing. Providence was bountiful to them; but Nature left\r\nthese diamonds as rough, as many of the pebbles now in the streets.\r\nInstruction turned them; and education gave the high polish and the\r\npoint, which illumes and dazzles America, and throws their radiance\r\nfar into other countries. And have we not at this moment, genius and\r\ntalents in our Academy equal to Wirt's, and Pinkney's, and Monroe's?\r\nYes, without doubt, and among the sons of our mechanics too--and\r\nwould to Heaven I could fire their young bosoms with the noblest\r\nambition, without which they can never reach what they aim at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract is taken from Mr. Browne's MS. remains: on his\r\njourney across Asia Minor he thus describes a very remarkable people:\r\n\r\n\"In my visits to the Turkman tents, I remarked a strong contrast\r\nbetween their habits and those of the Bedouin Arabs. With the\r\nlatter, the rights of hospitality are inviolable; and while the host\r\npossesses a cake of bread, he feels it a duty to furnish half of\r\nit to his guest; the Turkman offers nothing spontaneously, and if\r\nhe furnish a little milk or butter, it is at an exorbitant price.\r\nWith him it is a matter of calculation, whether the compendious\r\nprofit of a single act of plunder, or the more ignoble system of\r\nreceiving presents from the caravans for their secure passage, be\r\nmost advantageous. The Arab values himself on the _hasb we nasb_,\r\nthat is, his ancient pedigree; the Turkman, on his personal prowess.\r\nWith the former, civility requires that salutations be protracted to\r\nsatiety; the latter scarcely replies to a _Salam aleikum_.\r\n\r\n\"The muleteers, who had preferred this devious path to the high\r\nroad, to avoid the dellis, were now alarmed at the frequent visits\r\nof the Turkmans. They described me to them as an officer of Chappan\r\nOglou's retinue, employed to communicate with the English fleet\r\non the coast; an explanation which appeared to satisfy them; and\r\nfortunately I was able to support that character. It is to be\r\nobserved that Chappan Oglou has a large military force at his\r\ndisposal, and administers justice with a rod of iron. His vengeance\r\npursues, on eagle-wing, the slightest transgression against his\r\nauthority. Our precautions at night were redoubled; and I divided\r\nthe time into two watches, which I ordered my servant to share with\r\nme; but the disposition to sleep having speedily got the better of\r\nhis vigilance, a pipe, although carefully placed under the carpet\r\non which I myself slept, was stolen unperceived before morning.\r\n\r\n\"The dress of the Turkmans consists of a large striped and fringed\r\nturban, fastened in a manner peculiar to themselves; or sometimes\r\nof a simple high-crowned cap of white felt. A vest, usually\r\nwhite, is thrown over the shirt; the Agas superadd one of cloth;\r\nand in general, and in proportion to their rank and wealth, they\r\napproximate to the dress of the capital. But the common people wear\r\na short jacket of various colours. A cincture is indispensably\r\nrequired, in which are fixed an enormous yatagan, and a pistol.\r\nMany of them wear half boots, red or yellow, laced to the leg: the\r\ndress of the women is a coloured vest, and a piece of white cotton\r\ncloth on the head, covering part of the face. They are masculine\r\nand active, performing all the harder kinds of labour required by\r\nthe family. Their features are good, but not pleasing. The men are\r\ngenerally muscular, and well-proportioned; tall, straight, and\r\nactive. Their teeth are white and regular; their eyes are often\r\nextremely piercing; and there is an air of uncommon boldness in\r\ntheir countenances and mode of address. Their complexions are\r\nclear, but sun-burnt. In a word, they have every thing that denotes\r\nexhaustless health and vigour of body. A general resemblance is\r\nvisible between them and the populace of Constantinople; but the\r\nlatter appear effeminate by the comparison. Every action and every\r\nmotion of the Turkmans is marked by dignity and grace. Their\r\nlanguage is clear and sonorous, but less soft than that of the\r\ncapital; expressing, as may be conceived, no abstract ideas, for\r\nwhich the Turkish is indebted to the Arabic alone; but fitted to\r\npaint the stronger passions, and to express, in the most forcible\r\nand laconic terms, the mandates of authority. Their riches consist\r\nof cattle, horses, arms, and various habiliments. How lamentable\r\nto think, that with persons so interesting, and a character so\r\nenergetic, they unite such confirmed habits of idleness, violence,\r\nand treachery! From the rising of the sun till his disappearance,\r\nthe males are employed only in smoking, conversing, inspecting their\r\ncattle, or visiting their acquaintance. They watch at night for the\r\npurpose of plunder, which among them is honourable, in proportion to\r\nthe ingenuity of the contrivance, or the audacity of the execution.\r\nTheir families are generally small, and there seems reason to\r\nbelieve that their numbers are not increasing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTUALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn English traveller, who has just published an account of a\r\nJourney in Holland, makes the following remark--\"The Dutch are as\r\npunctual as they are industrious and parsimonious. The diligences\r\nand treckschuyts start at the time appointed, during the striking of\r\nthe clock. If you are told that the hour is seven, you may be sure\r\nto be away before the fourth of the seven strokes has sounded.--The\r\nprecision at which the hour of arrival is fixed, is such that you\r\nmay depend upon it within a few minutes; and the same reliance may\r\nbe placed on the period of finishing the journey, whether it be made\r\nby water or by land.\" This is a most valuable trait of character in\r\nthat people, and is well worthy of universal imitation. There are a\r\nconsiderable proportion of mankind who are always behind-hand.--Let\r\nthem make ever so many or so important engagements, as it respects\r\npunctuality in time, they invariably fail.--Many such have fallen\r\nwithin our observation; and the same want of exactness in point\r\nof time attends all their concerns. If they go to church upon the\r\nsabbath, they will not get there until after the services have\r\ncommenced--and this happens to good, sober, pious Christians,\r\nas well as others; and it happens all their lives. Such is the\r\ninveteracy of this habit of negligence, that people, who would be\r\nshocked at the irreverence of any person who should so far forget\r\nhimself as to disturb the devotions of a religious congregation by\r\nspeaking, or in any other thoughtless manner, seem to have no idea\r\nthat their entrance into the church in the midst of the most solemn\r\nexercises, has any thing in it improper or censurable.\r\n\r\nThe same thing occurs in the attendance of such persons upon public\r\nbusiness, where they are associated with others. At meetings,\r\nappointed for the transaction of such business, if any considerable\r\nnumber are necessary to its accomplishment, there is often, and\r\nindeed usually, as much time spent in waiting for _a quorum_, as is\r\nconsumed in attending to the object of the meeting. This is a great\r\nhardship upon those who make a point of being strictly punctual,\r\nfor it costs them a double quantity of time. And these _behind-hand\r\npersons_, if they would only suffer themselves to reflect, could\r\nnot fail to remember, that punctuality would cost themselves no\r\nmore time than the want of it. Judging from considerable experience\r\nand observation, we are very well convinced, that about as much\r\ntime is spent in waiting for dilatory people, as is necessary for\r\ntransacting the business immediately in view when appointments for\r\nthe purpose are made.\r\n\r\nEspriella, if we do not mistake the writer, mentions his having\r\ntaken passage in a stage coach at York, in England, which was to\r\nstart at a certain hour. A few minutes before the time, every\r\nthing was prepared; the passengers took their seats; the coachman\r\nmounted his box, took the reins and his whip, but did not move.\r\nUpon being inquired of why he did not start, as every thing was\r\nready, he replied, _he was waiting for the Minster_--which meant\r\nthe cathedral church of that name. In a minute or two the secret\r\nwas explained--the Minster clock began to strike, and before it had\r\nfinished, the carriage was on its way.--We have no doubt that this\r\nhabit in the driver made every body who intended to make use of his\r\nvehicle strictly punctual. If, however, instead of starting at the\r\nmoment, he had practised waiting 5 minutes, occasionally, there\r\nwould have been much delay and vexation, by the dilatoriousness of\r\nthese behind-hand persons of whom we are speaking. We scarcely ever\r\nrecollect to have been on the wharf when a steamboat was casting\r\noff, without finding some person left, or running with breathless\r\nspeed to get aboard, being a few minutes _too late_. Such persons,\r\nwhen they find themselves safe on the deck, will almost always\r\nlook at their watches, and find it _a few minutes later than they\r\nimagined_, or their watches a little too slow, or something else is\r\nmade chargeable with the evil--when the honest truth is, _they are\r\nnaturally or habitually behind-hand_.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to imagine, unless our attention has been\r\nparticularly turned to the subject, how much time is lost, and how\r\nmuch a man's affairs suffer, from this dilatory disposition. It will\r\nmore or less run through and affect all his concerns. A dilatory\r\nman is perpetually in a hurry. His business always drives him--and\r\nbusiness transacted in a hurry, is rarely well done. We once knew a\r\nrespectable mechanic, whose habit of punctuality was such, that in\r\ncarrying on his trade quite extensively for more than forty years,\r\nhe never disappointed a single customer by not having his work done\r\nat the time appointed--he never failed of sitting down to his meals\r\nwithin five minutes of the time--he made his family, as well as his\r\nworkmen, conform strictly to his rules of punctuality--and it hardly\r\nneed be added, that he always supported the fairest reputation as\r\na man of business--and that he acquired an independent property,\r\nbeyond the handsome support of a large and expensive family.\r\n\r\n  [_N. Y. Daily Adv._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL CURIOSITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our readers, no doubt, have noticed accounts of living\r\ntoads, that have been found enclosed in stones and trees. This is\r\nperhaps one of the most extraordinary facts that has come within the\r\nobservation of naturalists; so extraordinary, indeed, that few, on\r\nthe first mention of it, have given it credence. So many instances,\r\nhowever, have occurred, attested by authority so respectable, that\r\nit would seem there now remains little room for doubt. Some of the\r\nmost remarkable may here be mentioned--instances that are well\r\nsubstantiated, and which have led inquiring men to investigate as\r\nminutely as possible the philosophy of the matter.--A living toad\r\nwas found in a large stone at Newark, on Trent, in England--it was\r\nwhite, measured three and a half inches, and appeared incapable\r\nof bearing light; for its motions argued an incompatible state,\r\nand in an hour it died. But in this time it was seen by several\r\nhundred people.--Three living toads were discovered lying together\r\nin a stone quarry near Cassel. No aperture was discoverable on the\r\noutside of the stone. The toads could with difficulty be removed\r\nfrom their bed, and endeavoured to return whenever they were\r\nremoved, but died in the course of half an hour. More of the same\r\nkind might be added; every one's recollection will no doubt, supply\r\nhim with instances which have occurred in our own country. Though\r\nnaturalists have endeavoured to account for this astonishing fact,\r\nyet we think their speculations have been in general very visionary.\r\nThe best account we have seen, is that by J. G. J. Ballenstedt,\r\nrector of Papsdorf, in the duchy of Brunswick. The substance of\r\nthis we present to our readers, hoping that will at least be found\r\namusing, at a time when political news is scarce, and uninteresting.\r\nMore than amusement need not be expected; for we regard his\r\nspeculation as we do most speculations of mineralogical travellers\r\nand geological societies--mighty light, airy and unsubstantial\r\nstuff. But let his rectorship be heard.\r\n\r\nAnother world besides the one we now inhabit, has had its existence,\r\ninhabited, as ours is, by animals terrestrial and marine. A\r\ntime was when all that is now land was covered by the ocean, as\r\nthe secondary mountains, with their beds of petrified marine\r\nproductions, abundantly prove. \"There, where at present the plough\r\nturns up the soil, and countless cornfields shine with their golden\r\nharvests--where immense forests spread their luxuriant trees,\r\namong which numerous wild animals sport--where hills and mountains\r\nraise their varied summits--where herds of cattle graze--where\r\nrivulets and rapid streams wind through valleys, and where cities\r\nand villages are now situated--there formerly raged the waves of\r\nthis ocean--there swarmed hosts of marine animals, of numberless\r\nforms and magnitudes.\"--The Almighty spoke, the waters disappeared,\r\nand these animals were left on dry land; those belonging to the\r\ndry land were swallowed up, together with their habitations, in\r\nthe great deep. Sea animals that have been petrified, are found at\r\nthe present day in the bosom of the earth; and under the bottom of\r\nthe sea are discovered river muscles and the beds of former great\r\nrivers. Whole forests were buried, and have been subsequently turned\r\ninto coal. The slime and mud of the bottom of the sea, when left\r\ndry, was hardened into stone, and strata of regular conformation;\r\nwhich, to produce the present irregularity met with among them, (we\r\nsuppose,) have undergone divers severe twistifications, by means of\r\nearthquakes, the great steam engine of geologists, whose boiler has\r\nburst more than once; we may credit the accounts of these profound\r\nworld makers.\r\n\r\nDuring this awful catastrophe, these living toads were probably\r\nenclosed in their stony prisons. They were covered and buried\r\nwith mud, which afterwards was hardened into stone by the active\r\nexertions of Mr. Unknown Process, a worthy old gentleman, of\r\nastonishing powers, who occasionally has the kindness to assist poor\r\nphilosophers in their immense task of creating worlds. In this mud,\r\npoor fellows, they would have gone the way of all flesh, had it not\r\nbeen for their peculiar organization; for they possess the \"power\r\nof sleeping and remaining in a state of torpor during the winter\r\nwithout having occasion for any nourishment during that period.\"\r\nWhen enclosed in mud, therefore, the same process went on as in\r\nwinter, but for a longer time.--They had nothing to do but to go to\r\nbed, and get to sleep as soon as possible, and enjoy a comfortable\r\nnap of several thousand years, till accident should unhouse them,\r\nand turn them out to enjoy the glorious light of the sun, and a\r\nthousand other things they had never dreamed of. Being fast asleep,\r\nand so closely and comfortably wrapped up in a stone blanket\r\nseveral feet thick, \"no exhalation could take place from them, and,\r\ntherefore, there could be no necessity to replace the lost animal\r\njuices by various nourishment.\" Wonderful phenomenon! The toad, this\r\nhighly and much despised animal, was of all others the only one\r\ncapable of undergoing this experiment of nature, and, thereby, of\r\nviewing a second time the light of the world. All others the most\r\nnoble and most beautiful of creatures, even man himself, had it not\r\nin his power to live to see such a blessing. Man, with his fellow\r\ncreatures, could only pass into a new world in a petrified state;\r\ninsects of a former world could only be preserved from complete ruin\r\nin amber, and the mammoth be preserved partially in ice; but the\r\ntoad was capable on account of its tenacious powers of life, and its\r\npeculiar nature, to pass from the old world into the new one, in a\r\nliving state, and by these means to be snatched from destruction. It\r\nhas twice trodden the theatre of the world!!--Wonderful phenomenon!\r\nwe respond. Wonderful, indeed, when we take into consideration the\r\nmany other created beings that sleep during winter, which had the\r\nsame risk to run of being enclosed in this mud, and therefore,\r\n\"from their peculiar nature,\" had the same chance of enjoying a\r\ncomfortable nap of several thousand years.\r\n\r\n  [_Milledgeville Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF MADEIRA.\r\n\r\nFrom a late account of that Island published in London.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of the island is excellent, being between the extremes\r\nof heat and cold; indeed the climate and soil are such, that the\r\nfruits of the earth are yielded with very little trouble in their\r\ncultivation, which, from the negligence of the inhabitants, is\r\nhighly essential.\r\n\r\nNearly every kind of European vegetable production is to be met\r\nwith here, to which may be added the sweet potato and yam. The same\r\nmay be said of fruits, and with care might be produced most of the\r\ntropical ones. The oranges, lemons, and figs, are remarkably fine:\r\npeaches, nectarines, apricots &c. are very abundant.\r\n\r\nThe hills are covered with very large chesnut and walnut trees; the\r\nformer producing the finest fruit of its kind in the world, and\r\nforming one source of sustenance to the hardy peasantry.\r\n\r\nThe island is formed of one immense hill or mountain, running from\r\neast to west, affording views beautifully romantic, abounding with\r\nfine springs of the purest water in the universe; while verdure and\r\nfertility cover the most unpromising situations. Pico Ruivo is five\r\nthousand one hundred feet high.\r\n\r\nThe city of Funchal is very delightfully situated at the foot of\r\nthis lofty range of mountains, on the south side of the island;\r\nwhich forms a kind of amphitheatre, and has a beautiful appearance\r\nfrom the shipping as you approach it, the environs abounding with\r\nvineyards, generally in the most luxuriant state; and in the midst\r\nof the green foliage of the vine, orange, lemon, pomegranate,\r\nbannanas, myrtle, cypress, cedar, &c. are numerous villas belonging\r\nto the gentry, or to the British merchants, which, being quite\r\nwhite, add greatly to the beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\nFunchal is the emporium of the island; it contains about twenty\r\nthousand inhabitants, (the population of the whole island is one\r\nhundred thousand souls,) and is the residence of a governor, bishop,\r\ncorrigidor, juiz da fora and other public functionaries. It is a\r\nvery irregular built town; the streets are generally narrow and\r\ncrooked, having no foot paths, and are badly paved; but it is quite\r\nthe reverse of Lisbon, being extremely clean. The old houses are ill\r\nbuilt; but they have lately much improved in architecture, for the\r\nmodern buildings are generally handsome, and are invariably built\r\nwith stone, plastered over and whitewashed: most of the houses of\r\nthe gentry are stuccoed inside, many of them are very elegant, and\r\nthey are for the most part handsomely furnished in the English style.\r\n\r\nThe residence of the governor is called the palace of Fort St.\r\nLawrence; it is a large ancient building: a few years since, it was\r\ngreatly improved by the addition of a new suit of apartments, built\r\nunder the direction of an English gentlemen, which are elegant and\r\ncommodious.\r\n\r\nFunchal has several handsome churches, the altar pieces of which\r\nare highly ornamented with paintings, silver lamps, and railings,\r\ntogether with richly carved and gilt figures, &c.\r\n\r\nThere are, on the island, about twelve hundred secular priests,\r\ngoverned by a dean and chapter, with a bishop at their head.\r\n\r\nFunchal towards the sea side, is protected by a parapet wall,\r\nproperly called the musketry parapet: the fortifications consist of\r\na castle erected upon a steep rock, on the west side of the harbour,\r\nand is within a few yards of the shore; it is very ancient, and\r\nmounts nine guns of different calibre. This fort returns the salute\r\nof the different vessels of war, anchoring in the roads; and the\r\ncastle serves for a state prison.\r\n\r\nThere is one small vegetable and fruit market, but the cattle, beef,\r\nand fish markets, are miserable.\r\n\r\nThe prisons are ill constructed, badly governed, and insecure. They\r\nare altogether a disgrace to the island.\r\n\r\nAll the towns and villages, of which there are several, are\r\ninvariably situated on the sea coast.\r\n\r\nThe country is too uneven for wheel carriages, except just in the\r\ntown and its vicinity; the mode of travelling, therefore, is on\r\nhorseback, or on mules, and in palanquins or hammocks.\r\n\r\nThe native inhabitants of Madeira are commonly of a middling\r\nstature, well limbed, and of a darker complexion than the\r\ninhabitants of the colder climates of Europe, possessing a warmth of\r\nfeeling with more volatile humour than is usual in the phlegmatic\r\nconstitutions of people of more northern countries, they are\r\ncourteous in their dispositions, and are very polite in their\r\nmanners among themselves, as well as towards strangers. The females\r\ndisplay great taste in adorning their hair, the blackness of which\r\ncorresponds with their dark expressive eyes, and gives them a very\r\ninteresting appearance; they are almost universally distinguished\r\nfor the whiteness of their teeth, the smallness of their feet, and\r\ntheir finely turned ancles.\r\n\r\nThe convulsive state of Europe, for so many years, occasioned such\r\nan increased demand for the wines of Madeira, that they have, in\r\nconsequence, advanced to nearly treble the price at which they\r\nwere sold at the commencement of the French revolution. The cause\r\nis removed, but the effect is still continued, by the impolicy of\r\nthe British merchants, who out-bid each other in their purchases\r\nfrom the land proprietors and wine-jobbers: this rise in the price\r\nof wine has produced an increase of income to the landholders, and\r\nthus (to use the language of one of their own writers) many now live\r\nin splendour, whose parents were content with the simple manners\r\nof their neighbours on the opposite coast of Barbary.--Both sexes\r\ndress now in the highest style of English fashion: while most of the\r\nprinciple families have their card and music parties, routes, balls,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThere is no imprisonment for debt, and condign punishment is never\r\ninflicted in Madeira; for certain crimes the criminal is sometimes\r\nbanished to the Cape de Verds, and when the crime is death,\r\naccording to the Portuguese law, the felon is sent prisoner to\r\nLisbon, there to await his fate.\r\n\r\nMany of the natives are possessed of a turn for poetry, and almost\r\nthe whole of them are rhymesters.\r\n\r\nThe islanders have a great taste for music, and are very graceful\r\ndancers.\r\n\r\nThe highest gratifications of the natives are the church festivals,\r\nand religious processions; their avidity for these spectacles is\r\nso great, that they come from all parts of the Island to see them:\r\nalthough it is constantly a repetition of the same thing; the\r\nstreets are crowded with the delighted multitude, and the windows\r\nof the houses filled with the senhoras, who assemble there full\r\ndressed to see and be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom to bury their dead within twenty-four hours after\r\ntheir demise; they carry the body in an open bier to the place of\r\nthe interment, with the face and arms exposed to full view, attended\r\nby a concourse of priests and friars, chaunting a funeral dirge\r\n(that is when the deceased leaves money to pay for it, otherwise,\r\nno penny no pater-noster;) then follow the friends of the departed,\r\nand a motley tribe of beggars bearing lighted torches, although it\r\nshould be at mid-day. When the body is consigned to the grave, a\r\nquantity of lime and vinegar is thrown in to consume it, in order\r\nto make room for others, as they always bury within the church.\r\nRelatives do not accompany the funerals, being supposed to be\r\ntoo much affected by their loss. Widows of rank do not cross the\r\nthreshold for twelve months after the death of their _Caro Sposos_.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the peasantry is very simple, consisting of a shirt\r\nand drawers of linen of their own manufacture, the knee-bands of\r\nthe latter and collar of the former are worn both open, a pair of\r\nloose light goat-skin boots, which, with a small blue cloth cap,\r\nof a conical shape turned up with red, completes their dress;\r\nalthough they have a blue cloth jacket, but it is generally thrown\r\nover one shoulder, being seldom worn. They are very civil when they\r\nmeet a stranger; they take off their cap, and \"hope the Lord will\r\nprosper him;\" and when they encounter one another, they stand cap\r\nin hand, though under a perpendicular sun, till they have satisfied\r\neach other as to the welfare of their wives, children, relatives,\r\nacquaintances, cattle, domestic animals, and so on: there is then a\r\ngood deal of ceremony in settling the important question who shall\r\nfirst put his cap on again. They are very muscular, and are capable\r\nof undergoing incredible fatigue.\r\n\r\nA more desirable spot for the asthmatic or consumptive, uniting\r\nsuch numerous advantages cannot be found; the town of Funchal being\r\nsituated in a valley open only to the south, while it is completely\r\ndefended by the mountains rising behind, from those northern blasts,\r\nwhich in other situations too often prove fatal in cases of decline;\r\nand the temperature of the atmosphere is very little subject to\r\nchange, the thermometer being seldom higher than from 75 to 78 in\r\nsummer, and rarely below 65 in winter; indeed, the climate is so\r\nfavourable for invalids, that were it resorted to before the disease\r\nbecomes too long confirmed, it would seldom fail in restoring their\r\nhealth; but it is to be regretted that this resource is often\r\ndeterred till it is too late for any hopes of recovery, and when the\r\npatient has scarcely strength to undergo the fatigues of the voyage.\r\n\r\nWhen the Island was first colonized, prince Henry had the sugar\r\ntransplanted hither from Sicily; and, at one time, there were forty\r\nsugar mills on the Island, that article then forming the staple\r\ncommodity; now there is only one mill remaining, at which little\r\nsugar is made, but that little is excellent, and has a scent like\r\nthe violet.\r\n\r\nInstead of the cane the vine is now cultivated, the produce of\r\nwhich is well known and esteemed all over the world: the vines run\r\non trellises of cane work, about three feet from the ground, and\r\nthe grape is usually fit for making into wine at the beginning of\r\nSeptember, when they are obliged to tie up all the dogs, to prevent\r\ntheir getting at the grapes, of which they are very fond. Great\r\nquantities are destroyed by rats, lizards, and wasps.\r\n\r\nThe wine-press is a wooden trough, about six feet square, and two\r\nfeet deep, over which is a large clumsy lever. When the trough is\r\nnearly filled, about half a dozen peasants bare-legged, get in,\r\nand, with their feet, press out the precious juice; after which\r\nthe husks and stalks are collected in a head, and pressed with\r\nthe lever: this last pressing produces the strongest and choicest\r\nwine. The best wine is produced on the south side of the Island,\r\nand, when first made, is as deep coloured as Port: it ferments for\r\nabout six weeks after it is made. It is computed that about twenty\r\nthousand pipes are made annually, of which about two thirds are\r\nexported, principally to Great Britain, and British colonies, and\r\nthe remainder is consumed on the Island.\r\n\r\nThere are many different descriptions of grapes; the large sized,\r\nand which is merely a table grape, and is not made into wine, is\r\nabout the size of a muscle plum, and the bunches are so large as\r\nsometimes to weigh twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe wines shipped from Madeira, are classed Tinta, or Madeira\r\nBurgundy, Malmsey, Sersial, and simple plain Madeira; the three\r\nfirst thirty pounds per pipe dearer than the latter, which is sixty\r\npounds per pipe of 110 gallons, free on board. This high price is\r\noccasioned by the want of unanimity among the English merchants,\r\nor indeed a want of good faith towards each other, for they appear\r\noccasionally to rouse from their lethargy, meet at their consul's,\r\nand agree to give only certain prices for the wines at the press;\r\nbut, immediately after, each out-bids the other, and the wine-jobber\r\nlaughs in his sleeve, and profits by their folly.--Were a dozen of\r\nthe principal wine shippers to be unanimous, they might, with ease,\r\nreduce the wines at the press one third of the present exorbitant\r\nprices, and could, of course, make a similar reduction in the\r\nshipping prices, when they would consequently have larger orders:\r\nbut what can scarcely be credited is, that when they had what they\r\nterm a factorial meeting to affix the shipping prices for 1819,\r\nall but two of the sapient assembly were for raising the price\r\n8_l._ per pipe; and when these two proved to a demonstration that\r\nsuch conduct would only induce the wine-jobbers to make a similar\r\nrise, and merely add to their coffers, already overflowing with the\r\neffect of the merchants' past follies; the meeting still deemed\r\nit necessary to adjourn for a few days, before they would allow\r\nthemselves to be convinced.\r\n\r\nNo foreign wine is allowed to be imported, not even a few dozen of\r\nPort for private use, although it is the production of the mother\r\ncountry: this is being strict indeed, yet it is justifiable, as a\r\nvery few years since a discovery was made of an attempt to smuggle\r\ninto the Island a number of pipes of wine from the Islands of Fayal\r\nand Tenneriffe; and had not the most rigid methods been adopted,\r\nthe wine of Madeira would have lost its reputation, as no one who\r\nimported wine from thence could have been certain of having it\r\ngenuine: consequently the wines were seized, and the heads of the\r\ncasks were knocked out in the public marketplace, which overflowed\r\nwith the contents: the boats that landed it were confiscated, and\r\nthe smuggler condemned to transportation, or to pay to the crown, in\r\naddition to losing the wine, twice its amount.\r\n\r\nThe Island is well supplied with good beef, mutton, poultry, and\r\nsome wild pidgeons, quails, partridges, snipes, woodcocks, wild\r\nrabbits, &c. The Atlantic furnishes the Island with abundance\r\nof excellent jew fish, john dory, pike, mullet, hake, mackeral,\r\npilchards, turtle, cray fish, crabs, shrimps, limpets, &c. They have\r\na breed of small but handsome and serviceable horses.\r\n\r\nMost of the commercial characters on the Island are English; and\r\namong them are some respectable long established houses, possessing\r\nconsiderable capitals: there are about twenty different firms, and\r\nas many families. The total number of British subjects in Madeira,\r\nincluding women, children, clerks, and servants, amounts to one\r\nhundred; but they are too haughty, too jealous, and too envious of\r\nof each other, to be very sociable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROMPTER.\r\n\r\nHe does not work it right.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a vulgar saying the Prompter has selected for his text in this\r\nnumber! Yet these vulgar sayings are often full of good sense.\r\n\r\nI knew a young man who left the army with an invincible attachment\r\nto gambling. He followed it closely till he had lost most of his\r\nwages--he then purchased a shop of goods, mostly on credit--he had\r\nhis nightly frolics--_he kept it up_--he was a blood of the first\r\nrate--his goods were soon gone and not paid for--his creditors began\r\nto cry _peccavi_--in fact, _he did not work it right_. But his\r\nfriends helped him out of six scrapes, yea, out of seven. At length\r\nnecessity broke his spirit--it tamed him--he married, became a man\r\nof business, recovered his lost credit--and now _he works it right_.\r\n\r\nI often say to myself, as I ride about the country, what a pity it\r\nis our farmers _do not work it right_. When I see a man turn his\r\ncattle into the street to run at large and waste their dung, during\r\na winter's day, I say this man does not work it right. Ten loads\r\nof good manure, at least, is lost in a season by this slovenly\r\npractice--and all for what? For nothing, indeed, but to ruin a farm.\r\n\r\nSo when I see cattle, late in the fall or early in the spring,\r\nrambling in a meadow or mowing field, pouching the soil and breaking\r\nthe grass roots, I say to myself, this man _does not work it right_.\r\n\r\nSo when I see a barn yard with a drain to it, I say the owner does\r\nnot work it right; for how easy it is to make a yard hollow, or\r\nlowest in the middle, to receive all the wash of the sides, which\r\nwill be thus kept dry for the cattle. The wash of the yard, mixed\r\nwith any kind of earth, or putrid straw, is the best manure in the\r\nworld--yet how much do our farmers lose! In fact they do not work it\r\nright.\r\n\r\nWhen I pass along the road and see a house with clapboards hanging\r\nan end with one nail, and old hats and cloths stuffed into the\r\nbroken windows, and the fences tumbling down or destroyed, I\r\nconclude the owner loves rum--in truth, he does not work it right.\r\n\r\nWhen I see a man frequently attending courts, I suspect _he does not\r\nwork it right_.\r\n\r\nWhen I see a countryman often go to the retailer's with a bottle,\r\nor the labouring man carrying home a bottle of rum after his work\r\nis done on Saturday night, I am certain this man _does not work it\r\nright_.\r\n\r\nWhen a farmer divides a farm of one hundred acres of land among five\r\nor six sons, and builds a small house for each, and sets them to\r\nwork for a living on a little patch of land, I question whether _he\r\nworks it right_. And when these sons are afterwards unable to live\r\non these mutilated farms, and are compelled by a host of children to\r\ngo to work by the day to get bread, I believe they are all convinced\r\nthat _they have not worked it right_.\r\n\r\nWhen a man tells me his wife will not consent to go from home into\r\nnew settlements, where he may have land enough, and live like a\r\nnabob, and therefore he is obliged to sit down in a corner of his\r\nfather's farm, I laugh at him, and some time or other he will own\r\n_he has not worked it right_.\r\n\r\nA man in trade, who is not punctual in his payments, certainly _does\r\nnot work it right_; nor does the man, who trusts his goods to _any\r\nbody_, and _every body_.\r\n\r\nWhether in Congress or a kitchen, the person who _talks much_ is\r\n_little regarded_. Some members of Congress then certainly _do not\r\nwork it right_. A hint to the _wise_ is sufficient; but twenty\r\nhints have not been sufficient to silence the clamorous tongues of\r\nsome Congressional spouters.\r\n\r\nFamily government gives complexion to the manners of a town: but\r\nwhen we see, every where, children profane, indelicate, rude, saucy,\r\nwe may depend on it, their _parents do not work it right_.\r\n\r\nI once knew a young man of excellent hopes, who was deeply in love\r\nwith a lady. The first time he had an opportunity to whisper in\r\nher ear; and before he had made any impression on her heart in his\r\nfavour, he sighed out his sorrowful tale to her in full explanation.\r\nThe lady was frightened--she soon rid herself of the distressed\r\nlover--she said, _he did not work it right_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the New England Galaxy we find the following account of the\r\nTurks. If the facts are as stated, those that are termed barbarians\r\nare _Christians in practice_, while we who are Christians by name,\r\nare barbarians in reality.\r\n\r\n\"Notwithstanding their religion differs from ours, still I cannot\r\nhelp respecting it. They worship the same God that we do--they\r\nesteem our Saviour as a great prophet and lawgiver--their prayers\r\nare evidently offered with a sincere heart, and considering that\r\nit is the religion of their ancestors, how can we blame them for\r\npreferring it to ours? Did you but know in what contempt they hold\r\na renegado, you would agree in opinion with me, that the combined\r\npowers of the whole Christian world would not be able to persuade a\r\nvirtuous musselman to change his faith.\r\n\r\n\"Honesty, so often sought and rarely found, among the enlightened\r\nand religious communities of Europe and America, in this part of\r\nAsia and in the Turkish dominions west of the Hellespont, stands\r\nunrivalled.\r\n\r\n\"Whether a sense of virtue or moral obligations to each other\r\ncontained in the pages of the Koran is the cause, I am unable to\r\nsay; but all travellers who have visited this country, and are\r\ndivested of prejudice, will do them the justice to say, that theft\r\nis a crime almost unknown throughout the realms of the Grand Seignor.\r\n\r\n\"A merchant of Smyrna having occasion to send about five hundred\r\npound sterling a distance of about four days journey into the\r\ncountry, requested his brokers to find a suitable person! The first\r\nthey met in the streets, although one of the lowest porters, they\r\nengaged for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The gold was given him in a bag, and without even inquiring his\r\nname or residence in the city, he was directed to hand it to the\r\nmerchant in the village, whose name was given him on a piece of\r\npaper: and on his return he should receive the amount agreed on, and\r\nabout five dollars as a compensation for his trouble.\r\n\r\n\"On the eighth or ninth day he returned to the city, stating that he\r\nhad delivered the money, when he received his pay, and went to seek\r\nemployment in the streets.\r\n\r\n\"After a lapse of nearly a month, a letter from the merchant\r\nannounced that he had not received the money, and expressed surprise\r\nat the circumstance. This excited considerable alarm, particularly\r\nas it was almost impossible to find the messenger, having a second\r\ntime neglected to take his name. After three days search, however,\r\nhe was found staggering through the streets with a heavy burden on\r\nhis back; and being informed of the cause why they sought him, he\r\nlaid it down and exclaimed, 'God forbid that I should wrong any man,\r\neven a _Christian!_ but,' he continued, 'I will go back at my own\r\nexpense and see who has got the property; otherwise my reputation\r\nwill be ruined!' This speech had a curious effect from a man whose\r\nreal and personal estate would not, in all probability, have\r\namounted to fifty piastres.\r\n\r\n\"He departed, and arriving at the village, examined, with a\r\nscrutinizing eye, every Christian he met, till at last the Greek to\r\nwhom he had given the gold, presented himself. 'You have injured my\r\nreputation like a dog, as you are, (said the porter,) and have taken\r\nfrom me that which belongs to another! but, thank God, you are found\r\nat last; I will take you to the Agha, and have you hung, that the\r\nworld may be rid of such a scoundrel.' The Greek on his knees begged\r\nforgiveness: 'I was in distress, (he said) when I saw you, and\r\nhaving occasion for the money, I assumed the name of my neighbour!\r\nIt was my intention to have paid him before he would feel any alarm\r\nas to the remittance: but spare my character; here is your gold, and\r\nhere are 500 piastres for yourself!' The Turk allowed him to depart,\r\ntook the money to the right owner, and returned with his pockets\r\nbetter filled than they had ever been during the whole course of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\"The perfect resignation with which the Turks submit to the\r\ndispensations of Providence cannot but be pleasing to every one. If\r\nthey are fortunate, God is praised; if the reverse, they say, 'His\r\nwill be done.'\r\n\r\n\"The Turk never effects insurance on his commercial adventures; but\r\noften, previous to despatching his vessel, makes a solemn promise,\r\nthat, should he be fortunate, a sum of money shall be bestowed in\r\ncharity; which promise is never broken. But, should she be lost,\r\nand, as often happens, his whole property with her, he exclaims,\r\n'God's will be done,' and seeks in the streets the means of\r\naccumulating another, in the laborious employment of a porter.\r\n\r\n\"His friends continue to show him the respect he previously\r\nexperienced, remarking, 'Our brother has been unfortunate, but it\r\nwas the will of God! Why should we treat him otherwise? We are\r\nall liable to lose our possessions, and it would be censuring the\r\ndecrees of the Almighty, were we to neglect him!' How can we but\r\nadmire these principles, notwithstanding they emanate from the\r\nbreasts of those differing from us in religious tenets?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weight of Great Characters_--Weighed at the Scales at West Point,\r\nAugust 19, 1783.\r\n\r\n                            _lbs._\r\n  General Washington,        209\r\n  General Lincoln,           224\r\n  General Knox,              280\r\n  General Huntington,        132\r\n  General Greaton,           166\r\n  Colonel Swift,             219\r\n  Colonel Michael Jackson,   252\r\n  Colonel Henry Jackson,     238\r\n  Lieut.

Those\r\nwho read their biography would be gratified to know the cubic inches\r\nand exact dimensions of the clay tenements occupied by such martial\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nThe average weight of these 11 distinguished revolutionary officers,\r\nis 214 lbs. and exceeds, we think, that of an equal number of any\r\nother nation.\r\n\r\n  [_Salem Gaz._\r\n\r\n_Benevolence the source of delight._--BENEVOLUS, who was uncommonly\r\nfond of music, was dressing to go to an opera, which was much\r\nadmired, when he heard a murmuring of voices in the passage below\r\nhis chambers; on inquiry, he was told that it was occasioned by a\r\nworkman who had dropped half a guinea that he had just received for\r\nhis week's wages, which could not be found; and on which his own\r\nmaintenance and that of his wife and child depended. It immediately\r\nstruck Benevolus that he could afford to give the man the half\r\nguinea by staying from the opera that night. He accordingly sent him\r\nthe money and staid at home.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, Benevolus having been prevailed on to promise\r\nto dine at a tavern with some young men, of whose company he was\r\nfond, was solicited for charity at the tavern door by a woman with\r\nan infant suckling at each of her breasts, and two half-naked\r\nchildren following her.--\"For heaven's sake, a penny,\" said the\r\npoor woman, \"to purchase some bread.\" \"We are very hungry,\" cried\r\nthe children. Benevolus, thrusting his hand in his pocket, found he\r\nhad just a guinea, and no other money of any kind. \"Good heaven!\"\r\nthought he, \"I am going to throw away the greatest part of this\r\nfor a dinner, and it will maintain this poor woman and children a\r\nfortnight!\"--He slipped the guinea into the poor woman's hand, and,\r\nreturning directly to his chamber, sent an apology to the company,\r\nand dined with more delight on a mutton-chop than he had ever\r\nexperienced from the most luxurious dinner.\r\n\r\n  [_Moore_.\r\n\r\n_Home._--The great end of prudence, Dr. Johnson says, is to give\r\ncheerfulness to those hours which splendour cannot gild, and\r\nacclamation cannot exhilarate. Those soft intervals of unbended\r\namusement, in which a man shrinks to his natural dimensions, and\r\nthrows aside the ornaments and disguises which he feels in privacy\r\nto be useless incumbrances, and to lose all effect when they become\r\nfamiliar. To be happy at _home_, is the ultimate result of all\r\nambition, the end to which every enterprise and labour tends, and\r\nof which every design prompts the prosecution. It is, indeed, at\r\nhome, that every man must be known, by those who would make a just\r\nestimate either of his virtue or felicity; for smiles and embroidery\r\nare alike occasional, and the mind is often dressed for show in\r\npainted honour and fictitious benevolence.\r\n\r\nThere is something undoubtedly venerable in antiquity, but even this\r\npassion may be carried beyond its proper bounds. An old gentleman\r\nwas once possessed of a jack-knife, which he declared he would not\r\nsell for twenty dollars. It was once, said he, the property of my\r\ngreat grandfather--and since I have been the owner of the knife, it\r\nhas been repaired with four blades and two handles.\r\n\r\n_The Emperor of Morocco._--The following anecdote serves to show the\r\n_high wisdom_ of the Emperor of Morocco:--A Jew had ordered a French\r\nmerchant to furnish him with a considerable quantity of black beaver\r\nhats, green shawls, and red silk stockings. When the articles were\r\nready for delivery, the Jew refused to receive them. Being brought\r\nbefore the emperor, who, it is well known, administers justice\r\nhimself, he denied having given the order, and maintained that he\r\ndid not know the French merchant. \"Have you any witnesses?\" said\r\nthe emperor to the Frenchman. \"No.\" \"So much the worse for you; you\r\nshould have taken care to have had witnesses--you may retire.\" The\r\npoor merchant, completely ruined, returned home in despair. He was,\r\nhowever, soon alarmed by a noise in the street; he ran to see what\r\nit was. A numerous multitude were following one of the emperor's\r\nofficers, who was making the following proclamation at all the cross\r\nroads: \"Every Jew, who within 24 hours after this proclamation,\r\nshall be found in the streets without a black beaver hat on his\r\nhead, a green shawl round his neck, and red silk stockings on his\r\nlegs, shall be immediately seized, and conveyed to the first Court\r\nor Palace, to be there flogged to death.\" The children of Israel all\r\nthronged to the French merchant, and before evening the articles\r\nwere all purchased at any price he chose to demand for them.\r\n\r\n_A knave outwitted._--A man lately came into a merchant's store in\r\nNewbern, N. C. and told the merchant he owed him five dollars for\r\ngoods he lately had of him. The merchant being a correct man in\r\nhis business, finding no charge against him on book, and knowing\r\nalso that he never gave credit to strangers, told the honest man he\r\nmust be mistaken; but he insisted he was not, and paid the money.\r\nA few days afterwards he called again and wanted credit for goods\r\nto the amount of about $30, which the merchant declined letting him\r\nhave. The man pretended to be surprised that he, who had shown such\r\nhonesty in paying a debt, which the merchant had forgotten, should\r\nbe refused a further credit; but says the merchant, if I have been\r\nfoolish enough, for once to trust a stranger, I shall not be such a\r\nfool again.\r\n\r\n_Mineralogy._--The science of mineralogy is at present pursued with\r\nuncommon assiduity in England.--The elementary treatises on the\r\nsubject, as published there, are numerous, but lately Mr. Philips\r\npublished a second edition of a Manual of Mineralogy, of which in 9\r\nmonths he sold 900 copies. In Paris there are four lectures on the\r\nsubject, and last year the only four students who were foreigners,\r\nwere all from Pennsylvania--these were the young Messrs. Gallatin,\r\nSeybert, Keating, and Vancexin. The science seems to be highly\r\ndeserving of encouragement here, as it has become reduced to such\r\ngeneral rules as enables the mineralist or geologist to ascertain\r\nwith tolerable certainty what substances are, and what are not\r\nto be found in the bowels of different parts of the earth, by\r\ninspection of its surface, as well as to ascertain by sight, or by\r\nanalysis, their nature, composition, properties, and uses.\r\n\r\n_Cave in Virginia_.--Of _Wier's Cave_ in Virginia, general C.\r\nJones, of that state, has lately given a description, of which\r\nthe following is a summary. The cave is of limestone, generally\r\ndescending in its course. The entrance, about 4 feet square, brings\r\nyou first into a room 12 or 15 feet high; you then creep along\r\na narrow passage into another room--then, descending a ladder,\r\nyou enter _Solomon's temple_, in which is a large fluted column,\r\ncalled _Solomon's pillar_, and on the sides curtains descend from\r\nthe ceiling to the floor, the room about 25 feet high; ascending\r\na ladder, you pass a steep narrow rock, and then descend into the\r\n_curtain room_, profusely ornamented with drapery, having more of\r\nthe appearance of art than of chance, the curtains hanging from\r\n6 to 12 inches apart, and mostly white and transparent:--next is\r\nthe _music room_, abounding with stalactites similar to those\r\nforming the curtains just mentioned, but of firm texture, on which\r\nenchanting music can be made, when struck with a skilful hand:--You\r\nnext descend a natural staircase, with something like balusters on\r\none side, and then, down a ladder, into the _ballroom_, 100 feet\r\nlong, and from 16 to 20 high, the floor smooth, the sides ornamented\r\nwith curtains, and in which there is a sofa, remarkable for its\r\nresemblance to the reality. You next encounter a long difficult\r\nnarrow passage, creeping and sliding part of the way, and then,\r\ndescending some steps, you enter the _vestibule_, the arch about\r\n25 feet high, in which is a saloon, and Mary's gallery, the latter\r\nformed of a horizontal sheet of rock, a foot thick, and 20 in\r\ndiameter:--You then enter _Washington-Hall_, the grandest part of\r\nthe cavern, the floor of which is level, and rings to the tread,\r\nthe arch above 80 feet high, and on one side is something like a\r\na row of marble statuary:--The next is _Lady Washington's drawing\r\nroom_, a handsome large apartment, with something like a bureau in\r\nit, on which are inscribed a number of names:--The _diamond room_\r\nis next, its walls sparkling with brilliants; then the _enchanted\r\nroom_, in which is a basin containing about two hogsheads of pure\r\nwater, and a column, about 25 feet in diameter, called the tower\r\nof Babel; and the last is the _Garden of Eden_. This is a spacious\r\napartment, in which a rock seems to be floating over head, called\r\nElijah's mantle, and a large white curtain, and a rock called the\r\nsalt mountain, are seen at a distance. The general, and the party\r\nwith him, were two hours and three quarters before they regained the\r\nmouth of the cavern.\r\n\r\n_Missouri._--The Missouri Convention, having completed its labours\r\nin the formation of a constitution for that state, have designated\r\nSt. Louis as the seat of government for the state until 1827, when\r\nit is to be permanently established on the Missouri, at or near the\r\nmouth of the Osage, which place is to be called Missouriopolis, the\r\nformer part of the name being Indian, and the latter Grecian.\r\n\r\n_Iron Rail or Carriage-ways._--In the neighbourhood of Newcastle,\r\nthis ingenious mode of reducing friction, and facilitating the\r\nconveyance of loaded wagons, has been adopted to a very great\r\nextent. According to M. Gallois, an extent of 28 square miles on\r\nthe surface of the earth, presents a series of 75 miles for this\r\nspecies of conveyance; while the interior of the adjacent coal\r\nmines contains them to as large an amount. Five or six wagons, made\r\nentirely of iron, fastened to each other in regular succession,\r\ndescend these roads without any other mover than their own\r\ngravitating force. By means of a pulley, or wheel, a certain number\r\nof carriages in descending occasion a certain number of others to\r\nmount, in order to take in a load at the summit of the inclined\r\nplane they traverse. We are, however, naturally led to believe\r\nthat, excepting in very peculiar circumstances, there will always\r\nbe a great saving of power in conveyances by water, for this simple\r\nreason, that the whole weight of the burden so transported, is\r\ntransported by the stream with a comparatively small loss of power\r\nby friction, while the inclined plane, on which the carriage runs,\r\nsupports only a part of its weight. On the other hand, however, it\r\ncannot be denied that many situations in which it would be quite\r\nimpossible to open a canal, might admit of the establishment of\r\nmetallic and other rail-ways.\r\n\r\n_Varnish for Wood._--The Italian cabinet work, in this respect,\r\nexcels that of any other country. To produce this effect, the\r\nworkmen first saturate the surface with olive oil, and then apply a\r\nsolution of gum arabic in boiling alcohol. This mode of varnishing\r\nis equally brilliant, if not superiour, to that employed by the\r\nFrench in their most elaborate works.\r\n\r\n_American Saltpetre._--A Boston paper says--\"We have seen a\r\nquantity of Saltpetre refined and chrystallized at the Gunpowder\r\nManufactory of Chelmsford, which, for whiteness and clearness, was\r\nmuch superiour to that of foreign preparations, with which it was\r\ncompared; and we understand it can be afforded at a less price. The\r\nchrystallization of the American articles is uncommonly handsome,\r\nand will gratify the attention of any who may view it.\"\r\n\r\n_The Horse._--J. Carver, Veterinary Surgeon, has written a letter to\r\nthe editor of the Plough Boy, wherein he stated he had been applied\r\nto by a gentleman to cut the Lampas out of his horse's mouth, but\r\nthat he had declined on the ground that there was no necessity for\r\nsuch an operation; and that the disorder could be cured in the\r\nfollowing simple manner:--\"Rub the upper part of the roof of the\r\nmouth, which you find on those occasions red and swollen, with\r\ncoarse salt, three or four times a day--throw in his manger also a\r\nfew ears of the hardest corn; and thus, a few days would totally\r\nremedy the evil.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carver expresses some astonishment that persons \"should fall\r\ninto the ridiculous and absurd belief, that horses are subject\r\nto that imaginary disease called Lampas. Because, examining the\r\npalate or roof of the mouth would be quite sufficient to convince a\r\njudicious investigator, that the supposed enlargement cannot deprive\r\nthe animal of his food; since it is not in the least sore, nor shows\r\nany signs of sensibility on pressure.\"\r\n\r\nHe states that the error proceeds from a want of the knowledge\r\nof the animal, and the obstinacy and ignorance of stabularian\r\nphilosophers; that the operation of \"_cutting and burning_ the\r\npalate with a red hot iron, not only prevents the animal from eating\r\nhis food for some weeks, but is frequently attended with the most\r\nserious consequences by opening the palatine artery, which has bled\r\nmany a horse to death for want of proper assistance.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carver advises gentlemen never to suffer the operation to be\r\nperformed, but if the parts are very red and very much swollen, they\r\nmay be just scarified with the point of a sharp penknife, or pricked\r\nwith a large darning needle. He concludes with saying, \"that the\r\ncutting and raising the frog from the ground to keep the foot in\r\nhealth--the cutting out the haw of the eye, to cure inflammation and\r\nlockjaw--and the operation of burning for Lampas, can by no means be\r\nreconciled to common sense.\"\r\n\r\n_Internal Wealth._--A correspondent informs us, that he passed, in\r\nDanvers, on Wednesday last, a wagon road of merino wool, weighing\r\nthree tons, drawn by seven horses, passing from Hanover, N. H.\r\n(where it was produced,) to the Factory at Danvers--the value of\r\nwhich was probably from four to six thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n  [_Newburyport paper._\r\n\r\n_Camels._--Two full grown camels, one eight and the other nine years\r\nold, have arrived at Boston from the coast of Morocco.\r\n\r\n_Paintings._--The paintings by the old masters, which belonged to\r\nthe late Mr. West, have been sold at public vendue in London. The\r\nwhole produced 10,027_l._ The Death of Actæon, by Titian, brought\r\n1700 guineas--a Head of Christ, by Guido, 700--Abraham entertaining\r\nthe Angels, by Rembrandt, 7 by 9 inches, 200--the Bath of Diana, by\r\nTitian, 610--a Forest Scene, by Rembrandt, 200--the Last Supper, by\r\nTitian, 435--the Virgin Child, and St. John and Mary Magdalen, by\r\nParmagiano, 350--the Watering Place, by Wouvremans, 560--Peasants\r\nwith Cattle, by A.

The expenditures during the same\r\nperiod, amount to $4203 53 cts. leaving a balance gained to the\r\ninstitution during the last year of $457.28. The amount of property\r\non hand has also increased $1811.41; and the balance of debts due,\r\n$743.14; making the whole income $2553.55; from which deducting\r\nthe amount received from the treasury, leaves a balance further\r\ngained of $454.55. In the amount of debts due is included $3637.03,\r\ncharged to the state house committee, for labour of the convicts in\r\npreparing stone, &c. for that building; which, if paid over to the\r\nstate prison, would reduce the sum required from the treasury to\r\nmeet the estimated expenses of the present year to $963.\r\n\r\n_Anecdote of Lycurgus._--Lycurgus, the Spartan lawgiver, to show\r\nhis countrymen the vast importance of education, by reason of its\r\ninfluence in forming the minds and manners of a people, caused\r\ntwo whelps of the same litter to be bred in quite different ways;\r\nwhereby the one became sluggish and ravenous, the other of a good\r\nscent, and skilled in hunting. Finding the experiment to answer his\r\ndesign, he soon took an occasion at an assembly of the Lacedemonians\r\nto discourse on this subject, and address them in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n\"It is of great advantage, fellow citizens, to the acquirement\r\nof virtue, when any one is trained up in the customary practice\r\nof wholesome instructions, and precept, which I will presently\r\nlet you see by example.\"--On this, he ordered the young dogs to\r\nbe brought into the midst of the hall, where was set before them\r\na vessel, in which meat had been frequently boiled, and a _live\r\nhare_.--Whereupon, according to their different breeding, one flew\r\nto the hare, and the other as greedily ran to the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe spectators were surprised: and, as they were musing what should\r\nbe the intent of his introducing the whelps after this manner, he\r\nsaid to them, \"This is what I before told you; you perceive these\r\ncreatures do as they were taught, for, though they are both of a\r\nlitter, yet the diversity of breeding has made one a good hound, and\r\nthe other a cur, good for nothing but to lick pots and dishes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract is taken from the Poems of CUNNINGHAM, whose\r\npastorals are those in which he is generally considered as the most\r\nsuccessful. The moral of this fable is good; and if resembled in our\r\ndaily intercourse with each other, might be highly useful.\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT.\r\n\r\n    The Fox and the Cat, as they travell'd one day,\r\n    With moral discourses cut shorter the way:\r\n    \"'Tis great,\" says the Fox, \"to make Justice our guide!\"\r\n    \"How godlike is mercy!\" Grimalkin replied.\r\n    Whilst thus they proceeded, a wolf from the wood,\r\n    Impatient of hunger, and thirsting for blood,\r\n    Rushed forth--as he saw the dull shepherd asleep,\r\n    And seized for his supper an innocent sheep.\r\n    \"In vain, wretched victim, for mercy you bleat,\r\n    When mutton's at hand,\" says the Wolf, \"I must eat.\"\r\n    Grimalkin's astonished--the Fox stood aghast,\r\n    To see the fell beast at his bloody repast.\r\n    \"What a wretch,\" says the Cat,--\"'tis the vilest of brutes:\r\n    Does he feed upon flesh, when there's herbage--and roots?\"\r\n    Cries the Fox, \"While our oaks give us acorns so good,\r\n    What a tyrant is this, to spill innocent blood!\"\r\n    Well, onward they marched, and they moralized still,\r\n    Till they came where some poultry picked chaff by a mill;\r\n    Sly Reynard surveyed them with gluttonous eyes,\r\n    And made, (spite of morals,) a pullet his prize.\r\n    A mouse too, that chanced from her covert to stray,\r\n    The greedy Grimalkin secured as her prey.\r\n    A spider that sat in her web on the wall,\r\n    Perceived the poor victims, and pitied their fall;\r\n    She cry'd--\"Of such murders how guiltless am I!\"\r\n    So ran to regale on a new taken fly.\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\n    The faults of our neighbours with freedom we blame,\r\n    But tax not ourselves, though we practice the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Barton's Poems.\r\n\r\nSTANZAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    We knew that the moment was drawing nigh,\r\n      To fulfil every fearful token;\r\n    When the silver chord must loosen its tie,\r\n      And the golden bowl be broken;\r\n    When the fountain's vase, and the cistern's wheel,\r\n    Should alike to our trembling hearts appeal.\r\n\r\n    And now shall thy dust return to the earth,\r\n      Thy spirit to God who gave it;\r\n    Yet affection shall tenderly cherish thy worth,\r\n      And memory deeply engrave it,\r\n    Not upon tables of brass or stone,\r\n    But in those fond bosoms where best 'twas known.\r\n\r\n    Thou shalt live in mine though thy life be fled,\r\n      For friendship thy name shall cherish\r\n    And be one of the few, and the dearly lov'd dead,\r\n      Whom my heart will not suffer to perish;\r\n    Who in loveliest dreams are before me bro't,\r\n    And in sweetest hours of waking thought.\r\n\r\n    But oh! there is one, with tearful eye,\r\n      Whose fondest desires fail her;\r\n    Who indeed is afraid of that which is high,\r\n      And fears by the way assail her;\r\n    Whose anguish confesses that tears are vain,\r\n    Since dark are the clouds that return after rain!\r\n\r\n    May HE, who alone can scatter those clouds,\r\n      Whose love all fear dispelleth;\r\n    Who, though for a season his face he shrouds,\r\n      In light and in glory dwelleth,\r\n    Break in on that mourner's soul, from above,\r\n    And bid her look upwards with holy love.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Borne on the Ocean's heaving breast,\r\n      Mark yon stately vessel sail;\r\n    How in floating canvass drest,\r\n      Courts she every wanton gale!\r\n\r\n    Soft the prosp'rous breezes blow;\r\n      Fast she makes a wish'd-for shore;\r\n    Glitt'ring bright in splendid show,\r\n      Rich with India's golden ore.\r\n\r\n    Gently foams the recreant tide,\r\n      'Neath the golden-gilded prow;\r\n    Pleased the joyous waves divide\r\n      Still behind no track they show.\r\n\r\n    Yet at some far-distant day\r\n      Memory will the scene retrace;\r\n    Mark the wanton breezes play,\r\n      Hail the vessel's easy grace.\r\n\r\n    Buoyant thus on life's broad stream,\r\n      Man in all his beauty moves;\r\n    Blest with sweet contentment's beam,\r\n      Blest with all his bosom loves.\r\n\r\n    Swift each passing year rolls on;\r\n      Still contentment glads his mind;\r\n    Soon each passing year is gone--\r\n      Gone, nor leaves a track behind.\r\n\r\n    Then alike fond memory's powers\r\n      Pleasures long since past, review;\r\n    Lead him back to youth's bright hours,\r\n      And each blissful scene renew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK NOTE EXCHANGE,\r\n\r\nAT PHILADELPHIA--_Oct. 3d, 1820_.\r\n\r\n                   Per cent Disc't\r\n\r\n  VERMONT--generally,                     4\r\n\r\n  MAINE--generally,                       4\r\n\r\n  NEW HAMPSHIRE--generally,               4\r\n\r\n  MASSACHUSETTS--generally,               4\r\n    Boston Bank,                          2\r\n\r\n  RHODE ISLAND,                           4\r\n\r\n  CONNECTICUT--generally,               2-4\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK,--City Bank,                par.\r\n    Country generally,                  2-6\r\n    J.
