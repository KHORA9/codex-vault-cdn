Keyhoe, who relates here his investigation of the flying\r\nsaucers, writes with twenty-five years of experience in observing\r\naeronautical developments.\r\n\r\nHe is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. He flew in\r\nactive service with the Marine Corps, managed the tour of the historic\r\nplane in which Bennett and Byrd made their North Pole flight, was aide\r\nto Charles Lindbergh after the famous Paris flight, and was chief of\r\ninformation for the Aeronautics Branch, Department of Commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthor’s Note\r\n\r\n\r\nON APRIL 27, 1949, the U.S. Air Force stated:\r\n\r\n_“The mere existence of some yet unidentified flying objects\r\nnecessitates a constant vigilance on the part of Project ‘Saucer’\r\npersonnel, and on the part of the civilian population._\r\n\r\n_“Answers have been—and will be—drawn from such factors as guided\r\nmissile research activity, balloons, astronomical phenomena. . . . But\r\nthere are still question marks._\r\n\r\n_“Possibilities that the saucers are foreign aircraft have also been\r\nconsidered. . . . But observations based on nuclear power plant\r\nresearch in this country label as ‘highly improbable’ the existence on\r\nEarth of engines small enough to have Powered the saucers._\r\n\r\n_“Intelligent life on Mars . . . is not impossible but is completely\r\nunproven. The possibility of intelligent life on the Planet Venus is\r\nnot considered completely unreasonable by astronomers._\r\n\r\n_“The saucers are not jokes. Neither are they cause for alarm.”_[1]\r\n\r\n [1] Project “Saucer” Preliminary Study of Flying Saucers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 27, 1949, the Air Force denied the existence of flying\r\nsaucers.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] 2. Air Force Press Release 629-49.’\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 30, 1949, the Air Force revealed part of a secret Project\r\n“Saucer” report to members of the press at Washington. The official\r\nreport stated:\r\n\r\n“It will never be possible to say with certainty that any individual\r\ndid not see a space ship, an enemy missile, or some other object.”\r\n\r\nDiscussing the motives of possible visitors from space, the report also\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n“Such a civilization might observe that on Earth we now have atomic\r\nbombs and are fast developing rockets. In view of the past history of\r\nmankind, they should be alarmed. We should therefore expect at this\r\ntime above all to behold such visitations.”\r\n\r\n(In its April 22 report, Project “Saucer” stated that space travel\r\noutside the solar system is almost a certainty.)\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1950, the Air Force again denied the existence of\r\nflying saucers. On this same date, two saucers reported above Key West\r\nNaval Air Station were tracked by radar; they were described as\r\nmaneuvering at high speed fifty miles above the earth. The Air Force\r\nrefused to comment.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 1950, a large metallic disk was pursued by F-51 and jet\r\nfighters and observed by scores of Air Force officers at Wright Field,\r\nOhio. On March 18, an Air Force spokesman again denied that saucers\r\nexist and specifically stated that they were not American guided\r\nmissiles or space-exploration devices.\r\n\r\nI have carefully examined all Air Force saucer reports made in the last\r\nthree years. For the past year, I have taken part in a special\r\ninvestigation of the flying-saucer riddle.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Air Force statements, contradictory as they appear,\r\nare part of an intricate program to prepare America—and the world—for\r\nthe secret of the disks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a strange assignment.\r\n\r\nI picked up the telegram from my desk and read it a third time.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, N. Y., MAY 9, 1949\r\n\r\nHAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING FLYING SAUCER MYSTERY. FIRST TIP HINTED\r\nGIGANTIC HOAX TO COVER UP OFFICIAL SECRET. BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN\r\nPLANTED TO HIDE REAL ANSWER. LOOKS LIKE TERRIFIC STORY. CAN YOU TAKE\r\nOVER WASHINGTON END?\r\n\r\nKEN W. PURDY, EDITOR, TRUE MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nI glanced out at the Potomac, recalling the first saucer story. As a\r\npilot, I’d been skeptical of flying disks. Then reports had begun to\r\npour in from Air Force and airline pilots. Apparently alarmed, the Air\r\nForce had ordered fighters to pursue the fast-flying saucers. In one\r\nmysterious chase, a pilot had been killed, and his death was\r\nunexplained. That had been seventeen months ago. Since then, the whole\r\nflying-saucer riddle had been hidden behind a curtain of Air Force\r\nsecrecy.\r\n\r\nAnd now, an assignment from True magazine on flying saucers.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours later, I was in Ken Purdy’s office.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had men on this for two months,” he told me. “I might as well\r\nwarn you, it’s a tough story to crack.”\r\n\r\n“You think it’s a Russian missile?” I asked him. “Or an Air Force\r\nsecret?”\r\n\r\n“We’ve had several answers. None of them stacks up. But I’m positive\r\none was deliberately planted when they found we were checking.”\r\n\r\nHe told me the whole story of the work that had been done by the staff\r\nof True and of the reports sent in by competent writers. The deeper he\r\ndelved into the mystery, the tougher the assignment got. The more I\r\nlearned about flying saucers, the less I knew.\r\n\r\n“There’s one angle I want rechecked,” Purdy said.\r\n\r\n“You’ve heard of the Mantell case?”\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n“O.K. Try to get the details of Mantell’s radio report to Godman Tower.\r\nBefore he was killed, he described the thing he was chasing—we know\r\nthat much. Project ‘Saucer’ gave out a hint, but they’ve never released\r\nthe transcript. Here’s another lead. See if you can find anything about\r\na secret picture, taken at Harmon Field, Newfoundland—it was around\r\nJuly 1947. I’ll send you other ideas as I get them.”\r\n\r\nBefore I left, Purdy wished me hick and told me that he would work in\r\nclosest harmony with me.\r\n\r\n“But watch out for fake tips,” he said. “You’ll probably run into some\r\npeople at the Pentagon who’ll talk to you ‘off the record.’ That\r\nhandcuffs a writer. Look out they don’t lead you into a blind alley.\r\nEven the Air Force statements and the Project ‘Saucer’ report\r\ncontradict each other.”\r\n\r\nFor six months, I worked with other investigators to solve the mystery\r\nof the disks. We checked a hundred sighting reports, frequently\r\ncrossing the trail of Project “Saucer” teams and F.B.I. agents. Old\r\nrecords gave fantastic leads. So did Air Force plans for exploring\r\nspace. Rocket experts, astronomers, Air Force officials and pilot gave\r\nus clues pointing to a startling solution. Many intelligent\r\npersons—including scientists—believe that the saucers contain spies\r\nfrom another planet.\r\n\r\nWhen this first phase was ended, we were faced with a hard decision. We\r\nhad uncovered important facts, We knew the saucers were real. If it was\r\nhandled carefully, we believed the story would be in line with a secret\r\nAir Force policy.\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided to publish certain alternate conclusions. The\r\nAir Force was informed of _True’s_ intentions; no attempt was made to\r\nblock publication.\r\n\r\nIn the January 1950 issue of _True_, I reported that we had reached the\r\nfollowing conclusions:\r\n\r\n1 The earth has been observed periodically by visitors from another\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n2. This observation has increased markedly in the past two years.\r\n\r\n“The only other possible explanation,” I wrote, “is that, the saucers\r\nare extremely high-speed, long-range devices developed here on earth.\r\nSuch an advance (which the Air Force has denied) would require an\r\nalmost incredible leap in technical progress even for American\r\nscientists and designers.”\r\n\r\nNation-wide press and radio comment followed the appearance of the\r\narticle. This publicity was obviously greater than the Air Force had\r\nexpected. Within twenty-four hours the Pentagon was deluged with\r\ntelegrams, letters, and long-distance calls. Apparently fearing a\r\npanic, the Air Force hastily stated that flying-saucer reports—even\r\nthose made by its own pilots and high-ranking officers—were mistakes or\r\nwere caused by hysteria.[3]\r\n\r\n [3] Air Force press release 629-49, December 27, 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut three days later, when it was plain that many Americans calmly\r\naccepted _True’s_ disclosures, the Air Force released a secret project\r\n“Saucer” file containing this significant statement:\r\n\r\n“It will never be possible to say with certainty that any individual\r\ndid not see a space ship, an enemy missile or other object.”\r\n\r\nIn this same document there appears a confidential analysis of Air\r\nintelligence reports.[4] It is this summary that contains the official\r\nsuggestion Of. space visitors’ motives. After stating that such a\r\ncivilization would obviously be far ahead of our own, the report adds:\r\n\r\n [4] Air Force Project “Saucer” December 30, 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Since the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are\r\nA-bomb explosions, we should expect some relation to obtain between the\r\ntime of the A-bomb explosions, the time at which the space ships are\r\nseen, and the time required for such ships to arrive from and return to\r\nhome base.”\r\n\r\n(In a previous report, which alternately warned and reassured the\r\npublic, the Air Force stated that space travel outside the solar system\r\nis almost a certainty.[5])\r\n\r\n [5] Air Force report M-26-49, Preliminary Studies on Flying saucers,\r\n April 27, 1949.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1949 there has been a steady increase in saucer sightings. Most\r\nof them have been authentic reports, which Air Force denials cannot\r\ndisprove. In January, mystery disks were reported over Kentucky,\r\nIndiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, and several other states. On the Seattle\r\nAnchorage route, an air freighter was paced for five minutes by a\r\nnight-flying saucer. When the pilots tried to close in, the strange\r\ncraft zoomed at terrific speed. Later, the airline head reported that\r\nIntelligence officers had quizzed the pilots for hours.\r\n\r\n“From their questions,” he said, “I could tell they had a good idea of\r\nwhat the saucers are. One officer admitted they did, but he wouldn’t\r\nsay any more.”\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar incident occurred at Tucson, Arizona, on February 1.\r\nJust at dusk, a weird, fiery object raced westward over the city,\r\nastonishing hundreds in the streets below. The Tucson Daily Citizen ran\r\nthe story next day with a double-banner headline:\r\n\r\nFLYING SAUCER OVER TUCSON?\r\n\r\nB-29 FAILS TO CATCH OBJECT\r\n\r\n\r\nFlying saucer? Secret experimental plane? Or perhaps a scout craft from\r\nMars? Certainly the strange aircraft that blazed a smoke trail over\r\nTucson at dusk last night defies logical explanation. It was as\r\nmystifying to experienced pilots as to groundlings who have trouble in\r\nidentifying conventional planes.\r\n\r\nCannonballing through the sky, some 30,000 feet aloft, was a fiery\r\nobject shooting westward so fast it was impossible to gain any clear\r\nimpression of its shape or size. . . .\r\n\r\nAt what must have been top speed the object spewed out light colored\r\nsmoke, but almost directly over Tucson it appeared to hover for a few\r\nseconds. The smoke puffed out an angry black and then be came lighter\r\nas the strange missile appeared to gain speed”\r\n\r\nThe radio operator in the Davis-Monthan air force base control tower\r\ncontacted First Lt. Roy L. Jones, taking off for a cross-country flight\r\nin a B-29, and asked him to investigate. Jones revved up his swift\r\naerial tanker and still the unknown aircraft steadily pulled away\r\ntoward California.\r\n\r\nDr. Edwin F. Carpenter, head of the University of Arizona department of\r\nastronomy, said he was certain that the object was not a meteor or\r\nother natural phenomenon. . . .\r\n\r\n_Switchboards Swamped_\r\n\r\nSwitchboards at the Pima county sheriff’s office and Tucson police\r\nstation were jammed with inquiries. Hundreds saw the object. Tom\r\nBailey, 1411 E. 10th Street, thought it was a large airplane on fire.\r\n[A later check showed no planes missing.] He said it wavered from left\r\nto right as it passed over the mountains. Bailey also noticed that the\r\ncraft appeared to slow perceptibly over Tucson. He said the smoke\r\napparently came out in a thin, almost invisible stream, gaining\r\nsubstance within a few seconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis incident had an odd sequel the following day. Its significance was\r\nnot lost on the Daily Citizen. It ran another front-page story,\r\nheadlined:\r\n\r\nWHAT DO YOU MEAN ONLY VAPOR TRAIL?\r\n\r\n\r\nAs though to prove itself blameless for tilting hundreds of Tucson\r\nheads skyward, the U.S. Air Force yesterday afternoon spent hours\r\netching vapor trails through the skies over the city.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration proved conclusively to the satisfaction of most that\r\nthe strange path of dark smoke blazed across the evening sky at dusk\r\nWednesday was no vapor trail and did not emanate from any conventional\r\nairplane.\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday night spectacle was entirely dissimilar. Then, heavy\r\nsmoke boiled and swirled in a broad, dark ribbon fanning out at least a\r\nmile in width and stretching across the sky in a straight line. Since\r\nthere was no proof as to what caused the strange predark manifestation,\r\nand because even expert witnesses were unable to explain the\r\nappearance, the matter remains a subject for interesting speculation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence that this story was deliberately kept off the\r\npress wires. The Associated Press and other wire services in Washington\r\nhad no report. Requests for details by Frank Edwards, Mutual\r\nnewscaster, and other radio commentators ran into a blank wall. At the\r\nPentagon I was told that the Air Force had no knowledge of the sighting\r\nor the vapor-trail maneuvers.\r\n\r\nOn February 22 two similar glowing objects were seen above Boca Chica\r\nNaval Air Station at Key West. A plane sent tip to investigate was\r\nhopelessly outdistanced; it was obvious the things were at a great\r\nheight. Back at the station, radarmen tracked the objects as they\r\nhovered for a moment above Key West. They were found to be at least\r\nfifty miles above the earth. After a few seconds, they accelerated at\r\nhigh speed and streaked out of sight.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Commander Augusto Orrego, a Chilean naval officer,\r\nreported that saucers had flown above his antarctic base.\r\n\r\n“During the bright antarctic night,” be said, “we saw flying saucers,\r\none above the other, turning at tremendous speeds. We have photographs\r\nto prove what we saw.”\r\n\r\nEarly in March, Ken Purdy phoned the latest development in the\r\ninvestigation. He had just received a tip predicting a flurry of saucer\r\npublicity during March. It had come from an important source in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n“You know what it probably means,” he said. “The same thing we talked\r\nabout last month. But why were we tipped off in advance?”\r\n\r\n“It’s one more piece in the pattern,” I said. “If the tip’s on the\r\nlevel, then they’re stepping up the program.”\r\n\r\nWithin three days, reports began to pour in—from Peru, Cuba, Mexico,\r\nTurkey, and other parts of the world. Then on March 9 a gleaming\r\nmetallic disk was sighted over Dayton, Ohio. Observers at Vandalia\r\nAirport phoned Wright-Patterson Field. Scores of Air Force pilots and\r\ngroundmen watched the disk, as fighters raced up in pursuit. The\r\nmysterious object streaked vertically skyward, hovered for a while\r\nmiles above the earth, and then disappeared. A secret report was rushed\r\nto the Civil Aeronautics Authority in Washington, then turned over to\r\nAir Force Intelligence.\r\n\r\nSoon after this Dr. Craig Hunter, director of a medical supply firm,\r\nreported a huge elliptical saucer flying at a low altitude in\r\nPennsylvania. He described it as metallic, with a slotted outer rim and\r\na rotating ring just inside. On top of this sighting, thousands of\r\npeople at Farmington, New Mexico, watched a large formation of disks\r\npass high above the city.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these reports, the Air Force refused to admit the\r\nexistence of flying saucers. On March 18 it flatly denied they were Air\r\nForce secret missiles or space-exploration devices.\r\n\r\nThree days later, a Chicago and Southern airliner crew saw a\r\nfast-flying disk near Stuttgart, Arkansas. The circular craft, blinking\r\na strange blue-white light, pulled up in an arc at terrific speed. The\r\ntwo pilots said they glimpsed lighted ports on the lower side as the\r\nsaucer zoomed above them. The lights had a soft fluorescence, unlike\r\nanything they had seen.\r\n\r\nThere was one peculiar angle in the Arkansas incident. There was no\r\napparent attempt to muzzle the two pilots, as in earlier airline cases.\r\nInstead, a United Press interview was quickly arranged, for nation-wide\r\npublication. In this wire story Captain Jack Adams and First Officer G.\r\nW. Anderson made two statements:\r\n\r\n“We firmly believe that the flying saucer we saw over Arkansas was a\r\nsecret experimental type aircraft—not a visitor from outer space. . . .\r\n\r\n“We know the Air Force has denied there is anything to this\r\nflying-saucer business, but we’re both experienced pilots and we’re not\r\neasily fooled.”\r\n\r\nThe day after this story appeared, I was discussing it with an airline\r\nofficial in Washington.\r\n\r\n“That’s an odd thing,” he said. “The Air Force could have persuaded\r\nthose pilots—or the line president—to hush the thing up. It looks as if\r\nthey wanted that story broadcast.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the whole thing was planted?”\r\n\r\n“I won’t say that, though it could have been. Probably they did see\r\nsomething. But they might have been told what to say about it.”\r\n\r\n“Any idea why?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at me sharply. “You and Purdy probably know the answer. At a\r\nguess, I’d say it might have been planned to offset that Navy\r\ncommander’s report—the one on the White Sands sightings.”\r\n\r\nThe White Sands case had puzzled many skeptics, because the Pentagon\r\nhad cleared the published report. The author, Commander R. B.\r\nMcLaughlin, was a regular Navy officer. As a Navy rocket expert, he had\r\nbeen stationed at the White Sands Rocket Proving Ground in New Mexico.\r\nIn his published article he described three disk sightings at White\r\nSands.\r\n\r\nOne of the disks, a huge elliptical craft, was tracked by scientists\r\nwith precision instruments at five miles per second. That’s 18,000\r\nmiles per hour. It was found to be flying fifty-six miles above the\r\nearth. Two other disks, smaller types, were watched from five\r\nobservation posts on hills at the proving ground. Circling at\r\nincredible speed, the two disks paced an Army high-altitude rocket that\r\nhad just been launched, then speeded up and swiftly outclimbed the\r\nprojectile.\r\n\r\nCommander McLaughlin’s report, giving dates and factual details, was\r\ncleared by the Department of Defense. So was a later nation-wide\r\nbroadcast.\r\n\r\nThen the Air Force made its routine denial.\r\n\r\nWhy was McLaughlin, a regular Navy officer subject to security\r\nscreening, permitted to give out this story? Was it an incredible\r\nslip-up? Or was it part of some carefully thought-out plan? I believe\r\nit was part of an elaborate program to prepare the American people for\r\na dramatic disclosure.\r\n\r\nFor almost a year I have watched the behind-the-scenes maneuvers of\r\nthose who guide this program. In the following chapters I have tried to\r\nshow the strange developments in our search for the answer; the\r\ncarefully misleading tips, the blind alleys we entered, the unexpected\r\nassistance, the confidential leads, and the stunning contradictions.\r\n\r\nIt has been a complicated jigsaw puzzle. Only by seeing all parts of\r\nthis intricate picture can you begin to glimpse the reasons for this\r\nstubbornly hidden secret.\r\n\r\nThe official explanation may be imminent. When it is finally revealed,\r\nI believe the elaborate preparation—even the wide deceit involved—will\r\nbe fully justified in the minds of the American people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been over two years since the puzzling death of Captain Thomas\r\nMantell.\r\n\r\nMantell died mysteriously in the skies south of Fort Knox. But before\r\nhis radio went silent, he sent a strange message to Godman Air Force\r\nBase. The men who heard it will never forget it.\r\n\r\nIt was January 7, 1948.\r\n\r\nCrowded into the Godman Field Tower, a group of Air Force officers\r\nstared up at the afternoon sky. For just an instant, something gleamed\r\nthrough the broken clouds south of the base.\r\n\r\nHigh above the field, three P-51 fighters climbed with swift urgency.\r\nHeading south, they quickly vanished.\r\n\r\nThe clock in the tower read 2:45.\r\n\r\nColonel Guy Hix, the C.O., slowly put down his binoculars. If the thing\r\nwas still there, the clouds now hid it. All they could do was wait.\r\n\r\nThe first alarm had come from Fort Knox, when Army M.P.’s had relayed a\r\nstate police warning. A huge gleaming object had been seen in the sky,\r\nmoving toward Godman Field. Hundreds of startled people had seen it at\r\nMadisonville, ninety miles away.\r\n\r\nThirty minutes later, it had zoomed up over the base.\r\n\r\nColonel Hix glanced around at the rest of the men in the tower. They\r\nall had a dazed look. Every man there had seen the thing, as it\r\nbarreled south of the field. Even through the thin clouds, its\r\nintermittent red glow had hinted at some mysterious source of power.\r\nSomething outside their understanding.\r\n\r\nIt was Woods, the exec, who had estimated its size. Hix shook his head.\r\n_That_ was unbelievable. But something had hung over Godman Field for\r\nalmost an hour. The C.O. turned quickly as the loud-speaker, tuned to\r\nthe P-51’s, suddenly came to life.\r\n\r\n“Captain Mantell to Godman . . . Tower Mantell to Godman Tower . . .”\r\nThe flight leader’s voice had a strained tone.\r\n\r\n“I’ve sighted the thing!” he said. “It looks metallic—and it’s\r\ntremendous in size!”\r\n\r\nThe C.O. and Woods stared at each other. No one spoke.\r\n\r\n“The thing’s starting to climb,” Mantell said swiftly. “It’s at twelve\r\no’clock high, making half my speed. I’ll try to close in.”\r\n\r\nIn five minutes, Mantell reported again. The strange metallic object\r\nhad speeded up, was now making 360 or more.\r\n\r\nAt 3:08, Mantell’s wingman called in. Both he and the other pilot had\r\nseen the weird object. But Mantell had outclimbed them and was lost in\r\nthe clouds.\r\n\r\nSeven minutes dragged by. The men in the tower sweated out the silence.\r\nThen, at 3:15, Mantell made a hasty contact.\r\n\r\n“It’s still above me, making my speed or better. I’m going up to twenty\r\nthousand feet. If I’m no closer, I’ll abandon chase.”\r\n\r\nIt was his last report.\r\n\r\nMinutes later, his fighter disintegrated with terrific force. The\r\nfalling wreckage was scattered for thousands of feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Mantell failed to answer the tower, one of his pilots began a\r\nsearch. Climbing to 33,000 feet, he flew a hundred miles to the south.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that lured Mantell to his death had vanished from the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nTen days after Mantell was killed, I learned of a curious sequel to the\r\nGodman affair.\r\n\r\nAn A.P. account in the New York Times had caught my attention. The\r\nstory, released at Fort Knox, admitted Mantell had died while chasing a\r\nflying saucer. Colonel Hix was quoted as having watched the object,\r\nwhich was still unidentified. But there was no mention of Mantell’s\r\nradio messages—no hint of the thing’s tremendous size.\r\n\r\nThough I knew the lid was probably on, I went to the Pentagon. When the\r\nscare had first broken, in the summer of ’47, I had talked with Captain\r\nTom Brown, who was handling saucer inquiries. But by now Brown had been\r\nshifted, and no one in the Press Branch would admit knowing the details\r\nof the Mantell saucer chase.\r\n\r\n“We just don’t know the answer,” a security officer told me.\r\n\r\n“There’s a rumor,” I said, “it’s a secret Air Force missile that\r\nsometimes goes out of control.”\r\n\r\n“Good God, man!” he exploded. “If it was, do you think we’d be ordering\r\npilots to chase the damned things?”\r\n\r\n“No—and I didn’t say I believed it.” I waited until he cooled down.\r\n“This order you mentioned—is it for all Air Force pilots, or special\r\nfighter units?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say it was a special order,” he answered quickly. “All pilots\r\nhave routine instructions to report unusual items.”\r\n\r\n“They had fighters alerted on the Coast, when the scare first broke,” I\r\nreminded him. “Are those orders still in force?”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “No, not that I know of.” After a moment he added,\r\n“All I can tell you is that the Air Force is still investigating. We\r\nhonestly don’t know the answer.”\r\n\r\nAs I went out the Mall entrance, I ran into Jack Daly, one of\r\nWashington’s veteran newsmen. Before the war, Jack and I had done\r\nmagazine pieces together, usually on Axis espionage and communist\r\nactivity. I told him I was trying to find the answer to Mantell’s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n“You heard anything?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Only what was in the A.P. story,” said Jack. “But an I.N.S. man told\r\nme they had a saucer story from Columbus, Ohio—and it might have been\r\nthe same one they saw at Fort Knox.”\r\n\r\n“I missed that. What was it?”\r\n\r\n“They sighted the thing at the Air Force field outside of Columbus. It\r\nwas around sundown, about two hours after that pilot was killed in\r\nKentucky.”\r\n\r\n“Anybody chase it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No. They didn’t have time to take off, I guess. This I.N.S. guy said\r\nit was going like hell. Fast as a jet, anyway.”\r\n\r\n“Did he say what it looked like?”\r\n\r\n“The Air Force boys said it was as big as a C-47,” said Jack. “Maybe\r\nbigger. It had a reddish-orange exhaust streaming out behind. They\r\ncould see it for miles.”\r\n\r\n“If you hear any more, let me know,” I said. Jack promised he would.\r\n\r\n“What do you think they are?” he asked me.\r\n\r\n“It’s got me stumped. Russia wouldn’t be testing missiles over here.\r\nAnyway, I can’t believe they’ve got anything like that. And I can’t see\r\nthe Air Force letting pilots get killed to hide something we’ve got.”\r\n\r\nOne week later, I heard that a top-secret unit had been set up at\r\nWright Field to investigate all saucer reports. When I called the\r\nPentagon, they admitted this much, and that was all.\r\n\r\nIn the next few months, other flying-disk stories hit the front pages.\r\nTwo Eastern Airline pilots reported a double-decked mystery ship\r\nsighted near Montgomery, Alabama. I learned of two other sightings, one\r\nover the Pacific Ocean and one in California. The second one, seen\r\nthrough field glasses, was described as rocket-shaped, as large as a\r\nB-29. There were also rumors of disks being tracked by radar, but it\r\nwas almost a year before I confirmed these reports.\r\n\r\nWhen Purdy wired me, early in May of ’49, I had half forgotten the\r\ndisks. It had been months since any important sightings had been\r\nreported. But his message quickly revived my curiosity. If he thought\r\nthe subject was hot, I knew he must have reasons. When I walked into\r\nhis office at 67 West 44th, Purdy stubbed out his cigarette and shook\r\nhands. He looked at me through his glasses for a moment. Then he said\r\nabruptly:\r\n\r\n“You know anything about the disks?”\r\n\r\n“If you mean what they are—no.”\r\n\r\nHe motioned for me to sit down. Then he swiveled his chair around, his\r\nshoulders hunched forward, and frowned out the window.\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the Post this week?”\r\n\r\nI told him no. “There’s something damned queer going on. For fifteen\r\nmonths, Project ‘Saucer’ is buttoned up tight. Top secret. Then\r\nsuddenly, Forrestal gets the _Saturday Evening Post_ to run two\r\narticles, brushing the whole thing off. The first piece hits the\r\nstands—and then what happens?”\r\n\r\nPurdy swung around, jabbed his finger at a document on. his desk.\r\n\r\n“That same day, the Air Force rushes out this Project ‘Saucer’ report.\r\nIt admits they haven’t identified the disks in any important cases.\r\nThey say it’s still serious enough—wait a minute—“he thumbed through\r\nthe stapled papers—” ‘to require constant vigilance by Project “Saucer”\r\npersonnel and the civilian population.’”\r\n\r\n“You’d think the _Post_ would make a public kick,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean it’s an out-and-out denial,” said Purdy. “It doesn’t\r\nmention the Post—just contradicts it. In fact, the report contradicts\r\nitself. It looks as if they’re trying to warn people and yet they’re\r\nscared to say too much.”\r\n\r\nI looked at the title on the report: “A Digest of Preliminary Studies\r\nby the Air Materiel Command, Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, on ‘Flying\r\nSaucers.’”\r\n\r\n“Have the papers caught it yet?” I asked Purdy.\r\n\r\n“You mean its contradicting the _Post_?” He shook his head. “No, the\r\nPentagon press release didn’t get much space. How many editors would\r\nwade through a six-thousand-word government report? Even if they did,\r\nthey’d have to compare it, item for item, with the Post piece.”\r\n\r\n“Who wrote the _Post_ story?”\r\n\r\nPurdy lit a cigarette and frowned out again at the skyscrapers.\r\n\r\n“Sidney Shallett—and he’s careful. He had Forrestal’s backing. The Air\r\nForce flew him around, arranged interviews, supposedly gave him inside\r\nstuff. He spent two months on it. They O.K.’d his script, which\r\npractically says the saucers are bunk. Then they reneged on it.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe some top brass suddenly decided it was the wrong policy to brush\r\nit off,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“Why the quick change?” demanded Purdy. “Let’s say they sold the _Post_\r\non covering up the truth, in the interests of security. It’s possible,\r\nthough I don’t believe it. Or they could simply have fed them a fake\r\nstory. Either way, why did they rush this contradiction the minute the\r\n_Post_ hit the stands?”\r\n\r\n“Something serious happened,” I said, “after the _Post_ went to press.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but what?” Purdy said impatiently. “That’s what we’ve got to find\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“Does Shallett’s first piece mention Mantell’s death?”\r\n\r\n“Explains it perfectly. You know what Mantell was chasing? The planet\r\nVenus!”\r\n\r\n“That’s the Post’s answer?” I said, incredulously.\r\n\r\n“It’s what the Air Force contract astronomer told Shallett. I’ve\r\nchecked with two astronomers here. They say that even when Venus is at\r\nfull magnitude you can barely see it in the daytime even when you’re\r\nlooking for it. It was only half magnitude that day, so it was\r\npractically invisible.”\r\n\r\n“How’d the Air Force expect anybody to believe that answer?” I said.\r\n\r\nPurdy shrugged. “They deny it was Venus in this report. But that’s what\r\nthey told Shallett—that all those Air Force officers, the pilots, the\r\nKentucky state police, and several hundred people at Madisonville\r\nmistook Venus for a metallic disk several hundred feet in diameter.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a wonder Shallett believed it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think he did. He says if it wasn’t Venus, it must have been a\r\nballoon.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the Air Force answer?” I asked Purdy.\r\n\r\n“Look in the report. They say whatever Mantell chased—they call it a\r\n‘mysterious object’—is still unidentified.”\r\n\r\nI glanced through the case report, on page five. It quoted Mantell’s\r\nradio report that the thing was metallic and tremendous in size. Linked\r\nwith the death of Mantell was the Lockbourne, Ohio, report, which tied\r\nin with what Jack Daly had told me, over a year before. I read the\r\nreport:\r\n\r\n“On the same day, about two hours later, a sky phenomenon was observed\r\nby several watchers over Lockbourne Air Force Base, Columbus, Ohio. It\r\nwas described as ‘round or oval, larger than a C-47, and traveling in\r\nlevel flight faster than 500 miles per hour.’ The object was followed\r\nfrom the Lockbourne observation tower for more than 20 minutes.\r\nObservers said it glowed from white to amber, leaving an amber exhaust\r\ntrail five times its own length. It made motions like an elevator and\r\nat one time appeared to touch the ground. No sound was heard. Finally,\r\nthe object faded and lowered toward the horizon.”\r\n\r\nPurdy buzzed for his secretary, and she brought me a copy of the first\r\n_Post_ article.\r\n\r\n“You can get a copy of this Air Force report in Washington,” Purdy told\r\nme. “This is the only one I have. But you’ll find the same answer for\r\nmost of the important cases—the sightings at Muroc Air Base, the\r\nairline pilots’ reports, the disks Kenneth Arnold saw—they’re all\r\nunidentified.”\r\n\r\n“I remember the Arnold case. That was the first sighting.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve got contacts in Washington,” Purdy went on. “Start at the\r\nPentagon first. They know we’re working on it. Sam Boal, the first man\r\non this job, was down there for a day or two.”\r\n\r\n“What did he find out?”\r\n\r\n“Symington told him the saucers were bunk. Secretary Johnson admitted\r\nthey had some pictures—we’d heard about a secret photograph taken at\r\nHarmon Field, Newfoundland. The tip said this saucer scared hell out of\r\nsome pilots and Air Force men up there.\r\n\r\n“A major took Boal to some Air Force colonel and Boal asked to see the\r\npictures. The colonel said they didn’t have any. He turned red when the\r\nmajor said Symington had told Boal about the pictures.”\r\n\r\n“Did Boal get to see them?” I said.\r\n\r\n“No,” grunted Purdy, “and I’ll bet twenty bucks you won’t, either. But\r\ntry, anyway. And check on a rumor that they’ve tracked some disks with\r\nradar. One case was supposed to be at an Air Force base in Japan.”\r\n\r\nAs I was leaving, Purdy gave me a summary of sighting reports.\r\n\r\n“Some of these were published, some we dug up ourselves,” he said. “We\r\ngot some confidential stuff from airline pilots. It’s pretty obvious\r\nthe Air Force has tried to keep them quiet.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” I said. “I’ll get started. Maybe things aren’t sewed up so\r\ntightly, now this report is out.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve found out some things about Project ‘Saucer,’ said Purdy.\r\n“Whether it’s a cover-up or a real investigation, there’s a lot of\r\nhush-hush business to it. They’ve got astronomers and astrophysicists\r\nworking for them, also rocket expects, technical analysts, and Air\r\nForce Special Intelligence. We’ve been told they can call on any\r\ngovernment agency for help—and I know they’re using the F.B.I.”\r\n\r\nIt was building up bigger than I had thought.\r\n\r\n“If national security is involved,” I told Purdy, “they can shut us up\r\nin a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“If they tell me so, O.K.,” said Purdy. He added grimly, “But I think\r\nthey’re making a bad mistake. They probably think they’re doing what’s\r\nright. But the truth might come out the wrong way.”\r\n\r\n“It is possible,” I thought, “that the saucers belong to Russia.”\r\n\r\n“If it turns out to be a Soviet missile, count me out,” I said. “We’d\r\nhave the Pentagon and the F.B.I. on our necks.”\r\n\r\n“All right, if that’s the answer.” He chuckled. “But you may be in for\r\na jolt.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nJust the idea of gigantic flying disks was incredible enough. It was\r\nalmost as hard to believe that such missiles could have been developed\r\nwithout something leaking out. Yet we had produced the A-bomb in\r\ncomparative secrecy, and I knew we were working on long-range guided\r\nmissiles. There was already a plan for a three-thousand-mile test\r\nrange. Our supersonic planes had hit around two thousand miles an hour.\r\nOur two-stage rockets had gone over two hundred miles high, according\r\nto reports. If an atomic engine had been secretly developed, it could\r\nexplain the speed and range of the saucers.\r\n\r\nBut I kept coming back to Mantell’s death and the Air Force orders for\r\npilots to chase the saucers. If the disks were American missiles, that\r\ndidn’t jibe.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the lobby, I found it was ten after four. I caught a\r\ntaxi and made the Congressional Limited with just one minute to spare.\r\nIn the club car, I settled down to look at Purdy’s summary.\r\n\r\nSkipping through the pages, I saw several familiar cases. Here and\r\nthere, Purdy had scrawled brief comments or suggestions. Beside the\r\nEastern Airline report of a double-decked saucer, he had written:\r\n\r\n“Check rumor same type seen over Holland about this date. Also, similar\r\nPhilippine Islands report—date unknown.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI went back to the beginning. The first case listed was that of Kenneth\r\nArnold, a Boise businessman, who had set off the saucer scare. Arnold\r\nwas flying his private plane from Chehalis to Yakima, Washington, when\r\nhe saw a bright flash on his wing.\r\n\r\nLooking toward Mount Rainier, he saw nine gleaming disks outlined\r\nagainst the snow, each one about the size of a C-54.\r\n\r\n“They flew close to the mountaintops, in a diagonal chainlike line,” he\r\nsaid later. “It was as if they were linked together.”\r\n\r\nThe disks appeared to be twenty to twenty-five miles away, he said, and\r\nmoving at fantastic speed. Arnold’s estimate was twelve hundred miles\r\nan hour.\r\n\r\n“I watched them about three minutes,” he said. “They were swerving in\r\nand out around the high mountain peaks. They were flat, like a pie pan,\r\nand so shiny they reflected the sun like a mirror. I never saw anything\r\nso fast.”\r\n\r\nThe date was June 24, 1947.\r\n\r\nOn this same day there was another saucer report. which received very\r\nlittle notice. A Portland prospector named Fred Johnson, who was\r\nworking up in the Cascade Mountains, spotted five or six disks banking\r\nin the sun. He watched them through his telescope several seconds. then\r\nhe suddenly noticed that the compass hand on his special watch was\r\nweaving wildly from side to side. Johnson insisted he had not heard of\r\nthe Arnold report, which was not broadcast until early evening.\r\n\r\nKenneth Arnold’s story was generally received with amusement. Most\r\nAmericans were unaware that the Pentagon had been receiving disk\r\nreports as early as January. The news and radio comments on Arnold’s\r\nreport brought several other incidents to light, which observers had\r\nkept to themselves for fear of ridicule.\r\n\r\nAt Oklahoma City, a private pilot told Air Force investigators he had\r\nseen a huge round object in the sky during the latter part of May. It\r\nwas flying three times faster than a jet, he said, and without any\r\nsound. Citizens of Weiser, Idaho, described two strange fast-moving\r\nobjects they had seen on June 12. The saucers were heading southeast,\r\nnow and then dropping to a lower altitude, then swiftly climbing again.\r\nSeveral mysterious objects were reported flying at great speed near\r\nSpokane, just three days before Arnold’s experience. And four days\r\nafter his encounter, an Air Force pilot flying near Lake Meade, Nevada,\r\nwas startled to see half a dozen saucers flash by his plane.\r\n\r\nEven at this early point in the scare, official reports were\r\ncontradicting each other. just after Arnold’s story broke, the Air\r\nForce admitted it was checking on the mystery disks. On July 4 the Air\r\nForce stated that no further investigation was needed; it was all\r\nhallucination. That same day, Wright Field told the Associated Press\r\nthat the Air Materiel Command was trying to find the answer.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July was a red-letter day in the flying-saucer mystery.\r\nAt Portland, Oregon, hundreds of citizens, including former Air Force\r\npilots, police, harbor pilots, and deputy sheriffs, saw dozens of\r\ngleaming disks flying at high speed. The things; appeared to be at\r\nleast forty thousand feet in the air—perhaps much higher.\r\n\r\nThat same day, disks were sighted at Seattle, Vancouver, and other\r\nnorthwest cities. The rapidly growing reports were met with mixed\r\nridicule and alarm. One of the skeptical group was Captain E. J. Smith,\r\nof United Airlines.\r\n\r\n“I’ll believe them when I see them,” he told airline employees, before\r\ntaking off from Boise the afternoon of the Fourth.\r\n\r\nJust about sunset, his airliner was flying over Emmett, Idaho, when\r\nCaptain Smith and his copilot, Ralph Stevens, saw five queer objects in\r\nthe sky ahead. Smith rang for the stewardess, Marty Morrow, and the\r\nthree of them watched the saucers for several minutes. Then four more\r\nof the disks came into sight. Though it was impossible to tell their\r\nsize, because their altitude was unknown, the crew was sure they were\r\nbigger than the plane they were in. After about ten minutes the disks\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force quickly denied having anything resembling the! objects\r\nCaptain Smith described.\r\n\r\n“We have no experimental craft of that nature in Idaho—or anywhere\r\nelse,” an official said in Washington. “We’re completely mystified.”\r\n\r\nThe Navy said it had made an investigation, and had no answers. There\r\nhad been rumors that the disks were “souped-up” versions of the Navy’s\r\n“Flying Flapjack,” a twin-engined circular craft known technically as\r\nthe XF-5-U-1. But the Navy insisted that only one model had been built,\r\nand that it was now out of service.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, two astronomers spiked guesses that the disks might be\r\nmeteors. Dr. Girard Kieuper, director of the University of Chicago\r\nobservatory, said flatly that they couldn’t be meteors. “They’re\r\nprobably man-made,” he told the A.P. Dr. Oliver Lee, director of\r\nNorthwestern’s observatory, agreed with Kieuper.\r\n\r\n“The Army, Navy, and Air Force are working secretly on all sorts of\r\nthings,” he said. “Remember the A-bomb secrecy—and the radar signals to\r\nthe moon.”\r\n\r\nAs I went through Purdy’s summary, I recalled my own reaction after the\r\nUnited Airlines report. After seeing the Pentagon comment, I had called\r\nup Captain Tom Brown, at Air Force Public Relations.\r\n\r\n“Are you really taking this seriously?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Well, we can’t just ignore it,” he said. “There are too many reliable\r\npilots telling the same story—flat, round objects able to outmaneuver\r\nordinary planes, and faster than anything we have. Too many stories\r\ntally.”\r\n\r\nI told him I’d heard that the Civil Air Patrol in Wisconsin and other\r\nstates was starting a sky search.\r\n\r\n“We’ve got a jet at Muroc, and six fighters standing by at Portland\r\nright now,” Brown said.\r\n\r\n“Armed?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no report on that. But I know some of them carry photographic\r\nequipment.”\r\n\r\nTwo days later an airline pilot from the Coast told me that some\r\nfighters had been armed and the pilots ordered to bring down the disks\r\nif humanly possible. That same day, Wright Field admitted it was\r\nchecking stories of disk-shaped missiles seen recently in the Pacific\r\nnorthwest and in Texas.\r\n\r\nFollowing this was an A.P. story, dated July 7, quoting an unnamed Air\r\nForce official in Washington:\r\n\r\n“The flying saucers may be one of three things:\r\n\r\n“1. Solar reflection on low-hanging clouds. [A Washington scientist,\r\nasked for comment, said this was hardly possible.]\r\n\r\n“2. Small meteors which break up, their crystals catching the rays of\r\nthe sun. But it would seem that they would have been spotted falling\r\nand fragments would have been found.\r\n\r\n“3. Icing conditions could have formed large hailstones, and they might\r\nhave flattened out and glided a bit, giving the impression of\r\nhorizontal movement even though falling vertically.”\r\n\r\nBy this time everyone was getting into the act.\r\n\r\n“The disks are caused by the transmutation of atomic energy,” said an\r\nanonymous scientist, supposed to be on the staff of California Tech.\r\nThe college quickly denied it.\r\n\r\nDr. Vannevar Bush, world-famous scientist, and Dr. Merle Tuve, inventor\r\nof the proximity fuse, both declared they would know of any secret\r\nAmerican missiles—and didn’t.\r\n\r\nAt Syracuse, New York, Dr. Harry Steckel, Veterans Administration\r\npsychiatrist, scoffed at the suggestion of mass hysteria. “Too many\r\nsane people are seeing the things. The government is probably\r\nconducting some revolutionary experiments.”\r\n\r\nOn July 8 more disks were reported. Out at Muroc Air Force Base, where\r\ntop-secret planes and devices are tested, six fast-moving silvery-white\r\nsaucers were seen by pilots and ground officers.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon the Air Force revealed it was working on a case\r\ninvolving a Navy rocket expert named C. T. Zohm. While on a secret Navy\r\nmission to New Mexico, in connection with rocket tests, Zohm had seen a\r\nbright silvery disk flying above the desert. He was crossing the desert\r\nwith three other scientists when he saw the strange object flashing\r\nnorthward at an altitude of about ten thousand feet.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure it was not a meteor,” said Zohm. “It could have been a guided\r\nmissile, but I never heard of anything like it.”\r\n\r\nBy this time, saucer reports had come in from almost forty states.\r\nAlarm was increasing, and there were demands that radar be used to\r\ntrack the disks. The Air Force replied that there was not enough radar\r\nequipment to blanket the nation, but that its pilots were on the\r\nlookout for the saucers.\r\n\r\nOne report mentioned a curious report from Twin Falls, Idaho. The disk\r\nsighted there was said to have flown so low that the treetops whirled\r\nas if in a violent storm. Someone had phoned Purdy about a disk tracked\r\nby weather-balloon observers at Richmond, Virginia. There was another\r\nnote on a sighting at Hickam Field, Honolulu, and two reports of\r\nunidentified objects seen near Anchorage, Alaska.\r\n\r\nA typed list of world-wide sightings had been made up by the staff at\r\n_True_. It contained many cases that were new to me, reports from\r\nParaguay, Belgium, Turkey, Holland, Germany, and the Scandinavian\r\ncountries. At the bottom of this memo Purdy had written: “Keep checking\r\non rumor that the Soviet has a Project Saucer, too. Could be planted.”\r\n\r\nFrom the mass of reports, John DuBarry, the aviation editor of _True_,\r\nhad methodically worked out an average picture of the disks: “The\r\ngeneral report is that they are round or oval (this could be an\r\nelliptical object seen end-on), metallic looking, very bright—either\r\nshining white or silvery colored. They can move at extremely high\r\nspeed, hover, accelerate rapidly, and outmaneuver ordinary aircraft.\r\n\r\n“The lights are usually seen singly—very few formations reported. They\r\nseem to have the same speed, acceleration, and ability to maneuver. In\r\nseveral cases, they have been able to evade Air Force planes in night\r\nencounters.”\r\n\r\nGoing over the cases, I realized that Purdy and his staff had dug up at\r\nleast fifty reports that had not appeared in the papers. (A few of\r\nthese proved incorrect, but a check with the Air Force case reports\r\nreleased on December 30, 1949, showed that _True’s_ files contained all\r\nthe important items.) These cases included sightings at eleven Air\r\nForce bases and fourteen American airports, reports from ships at sea,\r\nand a score of encounters by airline and private pilots.\r\n\r\nWitnesses included Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force officers;\r\nstate and city police; F.B.I. agents; weather observers, shipmasters,\r\nastronomers, and thousands of good solid American citizens. I learned\r\nlater that many witnesses had been investigated by the F.B.I. to weed\r\nout crackpot reports.\r\n\r\nI ended up badly puzzled. The evidence was more impressive than I had\r\nsuspected. It was plain that many reports had been entirely suppressed,\r\nor at least kept out of the papers. There was something ominous about\r\nit. No matter what the answer, it was serious enough to be kept\r\ncarefully hidden.\r\n\r\nIf it were a Soviet missile, I thought, God help us. They’d scooped up\r\na lot of Nazi scientists and war secrets. And the Germans had been far\r\nahead of us on guided missiles. But why would they give us a two-year\r\nwarning, testing the things openly over America? It didn’t make sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nI went to the Pentagon the next morning. I didn’t expect to learn much,\r\nbut I wanted to make sure we weren’t tangling with security.\r\n\r\nI’d worked with Al Scholin and Orville Splitt, in the magazine section\r\nof Public Relations, and I thought they’d tell me as much as anyone.\r\nWhen I walked in, I sprang it on them cold.\r\n\r\n“What’s the chance of seeing your Project ‘Saucer’ files?”\r\n\r\nAl Scholin took it more or less dead-pan. Splitt looked at me a moment\r\nand then grinned.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell me you believe the things are real?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” I said. “How about clearing me with Project ‘Saucer’?”\r\n\r\nAl shook his head. “It’s still classified secret.”\r\n\r\n“‘Look, Don,” said Splitt, “why do you want to fool with that saucer\r\nbusiness? There’s nothing to it.”\r\n\r\n“‘That’s a big change from what the Air Force was saying; in 1947,” I\r\ntold him.\r\n\r\nHe shrugged that off. “The Air Force has spent two years checking into\r\nit. Everybody from Symington down will tell you the saucers are bunk.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not what Project ‘Saucer’ says in that April report.”\r\n\r\n“That report was made up a long time ago,” said Splitt. “They just got\r\naround to releasing it.”\r\n\r\n“Then they’ve got all the answers now?”\r\n\r\n“They know there’s nothing to it,” Splitt repeated.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” I said, “Project ‘Saucer’ shouldn’t object to my seeing\r\ntheir files and pictures.”\r\n\r\n“What pictures?”\r\n\r\n“That one taken at Harmon Field, Newfoundland, for a starter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that thing,” said Splitt. “It wasn’t anything—just a shadow on a\r\ncloud. Somebody’s been kidding you.”\r\n\r\n“If it’s just a cloud shadow, why can’t I see it?”\r\n\r\nSplitt was getting a little nettled.\r\n\r\n“Look, you know how long it takes to declassify stuff. They just\r\nhaven’t got around to it. Take my word for it, the flying saucers are\r\nbunk. I went around with Sid Shallett on some of his interviews. What\r\nhe’s got in the _Post_ is the absolute gospel.”\r\n\r\n“It’s funny about that April twenty-seventh report,” I said, “the way\r\nit contradicts the _Post_.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that was an old report—”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t say that,” Al Scholin put in. “The Air Force doesn’t claim\r\nit has all the answers. But they’ve proved a lot of the reports were\r\nhoaxes or mistakes.”\r\n\r\n“Just the same,” I said, “the Air Force is on record, as of April\r\ntwenty-seventh, that it’s serious enough for everybody to be vigilant.\r\nAnd they admit most of the things, in the important cases, are still\r\nunidentified. Including the saucer Mantell was chasing.”\r\n\r\n“That business at Godman Field was some kind of hallucination,”\r\ninsisted Splitt.\r\n\r\n“I suppose all those pilots and Godman Field officers were hypnotized?\r\nNot to mention several thousand people at Madisonville and Fort Knox?”\r\n\r\n“Take it easy, you guys,” said Al Scholin. “You’ve both got a right to\r\nyour opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sure,” said Splitt. He looked at me, with his grin back. “I don’t\r\ncare if you think they’re men from Mars.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s not go off the deep end,” I said. “Tell me this: Did Shallett\r\nget to see any secret files at Wright Field?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely not.”\r\n\r\n“Then he had to take the Air Force word for everything?”\r\n\r\n“Not entirely. We set up some interviews for him.”\r\n\r\n“One more thing—and don’t get mad. If it’s all bunk, why haven’t they\r\nclosed Project ‘Saucer’?”\r\n\r\n“How do I know? Probably no one wants to take the responsibility.”\r\n\r\n“Then somebody high up must not think it’s bunk,” I said.\r\n\r\nSplitt laughed. “Have it your own way.”\r\n\r\nBefore I left, I told them I was working with _True_.\r\n\r\n“I want to be on record,” I said, “as having told you this. If there’s\r\nany security involved—if you tell me it’s something you’re working\r\non—naturally I’ll lay off.”\r\n\r\nAl Scholin said emphatically, “It’s not an Air Force device, if that’s\r\nwhat you mean.”\r\n\r\n“Some people think it’s Russian.”\r\n\r\n“If it is, I don’t know it,” said Al, “and neither does the Air Force.”\r\n\r\nAfter I left the magazine section, I tried several officers I knew. Two\r\nof them agreed with Splitt. The third didn’t.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been told it’s all bunk,” he said, “but you get the feeling\r\nthey’ve trying to convince themselves. They act like people near a\r\nhaunted house. They’ll swear it isn’t haunted—but they won’t go near\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nLater, I asked a security major for a copy of the Project “Saucer”\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n“We’re out of copies right now,” he said. “I’ll send you one next\r\nweek.”\r\n\r\nI asked him bluntly what he thought the saucers were.\r\n\r\n“I doubt if anybody has the full answer,” he said seriously. “There’s\r\nbeen some hysteria—also a few mistakes. But many reports have been made\r\nby reliable pilots, including our own. You can’t laugh those off.”\r\n\r\nAs I drove home, I thought over what I’d heard. All I had learned was\r\nthat the Air Force seemed divided. But that could be a smoke screen. In\r\nless than twenty-four hours, I received my first suspicious tip. It was\r\nabout ten A.M. when my phone rang.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Keyhoe? This is John Steele,” said the voice at the other end.\r\n(Because of the peculiar role he played, then and later, I have not\r\nused his real name.) “I’m a former Air Force Intelligence officer. I\r\nwas in the European theater during the war.”\r\n\r\nI waited. He hesitated a moment.\r\n\r\n“I heard you’re working on the flying-saucer problem,” he said quickly.\r\n“I may have some information that would interest you.”\r\n\r\n“Mind telling me who told you I was on it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“No one, directly. I just happened to hear it mentioned at the Press\r\nClub. Frankly, I’ve been curious about the flying saucers ever since\r\n’45.”\r\n\r\nThat startled me, but I didn’t tell him so. “Do you have any idea what\r\nthey are?” Mr. Steele said.\r\n\r\n“No, I’ve just begun checking. But I’d be glad to hear what you’ve\r\ngot.”\r\n\r\n“I may be way off,” said Steele. “But I’ve always wondered about the\r\n‘foo fighters’ our pilots saw over Europe near the end of the war.”\r\n\r\nI thought for a second. “Wasn’t that some kind of antiaircraft missile\r\nfired from the ground?”\r\n\r\n“No. Intelligence never did get any real answer, so far as I know. They\r\nwere some kind of circular gadgets, and they actually chased our planes\r\na number of times. We thought they were something the Nazis had\r\ninvented—and I still think so.”\r\n\r\n“Then who’s launching them now?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s obviously either Russia or us. If it is the Soviet—well,\r\nthat’s what’s worried me. I don’t think it should be treated like a\r\njoke, the way some people in the Pentagon take it.”\r\n\r\nI stared at the phone, trying to figure him out.\r\n\r\n“I’d like to talk it over with you,” I said. “Maybe you’ve got\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve given you about all I know,” Steele answered. “There was an\r\nIntelligence report you might try to see—the Eighth Air Force files\r\nshould have it.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute,” I said. “Give me your number, in case I find\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\nHe gave it to me without apparent hesitation. I thanked him and hung\r\nup, still wondering.\r\n\r\nIf it was an attempt at a plant, it was certainly crude. The mention of\r\nhis former Air Force connection would be enough to arouse suspicion,\r\nunless he counted on his apparent frankness to offset it.\r\n\r\nAnd what about the Press Club angle? That would indicate Steele was a\r\nnewspaperman. Could this be merely an attempt to pump me and get a lead\r\non True’s investigation? But that would be just as crude as the other\r\nidea. Of course, he might be sincere. But regardless of his motives, it\r\nlooked bad. Arid who had told him about me?\r\n\r\nI thought about that for a minute. Then I picked up the phone and\r\ndialed Jack Daly’s number. “Jack, do you know anyone named John\r\nSteele?” I asked him. “I think he’s a newspaperman.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody I know,” said Jack. “Why, what’s up?”\r\n\r\nI explained, and added, “I thought maybe you knew him, and he’d heard\r\nabout it from you.”\r\n\r\n“Hell, no,” said Jack. “You ought to know I wouldn’t leak any tip like\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be a tip—I don’t know anything about this deal yet. By the\r\nway, when you were on the _Star_ did you handle anything on ‘foo\r\nfighters’?”\r\n\r\n“No, that was after I left there. Bill Shippen would have covered that,\r\nanyway.”\r\n\r\nI told him I would look it up in the _Star’s_ morgue. Jack said he\r\nwould meet me there at three o’clock; in the meantime he would see what\r\nhe could find out about Steele.\r\n\r\nJack was a little late, and I went over the _Star’s_ file on the foo\r\nfighters. Most of the facts were covered in a story dated July 6, 1947,\r\nwhich had been inspired by the outbreak of the saucer scare. I copied\r\nit for later use:\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of World War Two, fighter pilots in England were\r\nconvinced that Hitler had a new secret weapon. Yanks dubbed these\r\ndevices “foo fighters” or “Kraut fireballs.”\r\n\r\nOne of the Air Force Intelligence men now assigned to check on the\r\nsaucer scare was an officer who investigated statements of military\r\nairmen that circular foo fighters were seen over Europe and also on the\r\nbombing route to Japan.\r\n\r\nIt was reported that Intelligence officers have never obtained\r\nsatisfactory explanation of reports of flying silver balls and disks\r\nover Nazi-occupied Europe in the winter of 1944-45. Later, crews of\r\nB-29’S on bombing runs to Japan reported seeing somewhat similar\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, some foo fighters danced just off the Allied fighters’\r\nwingtips and played tag with them in power dives. Others appeared in\r\nprecise formations and on one occasion a whole bomber crew saw about 15\r\nfollowing at a distance, their strange glow flashing on and off. One\r\nfoo fighter chased Lieutenant Meiers of Chicago some 20 miles down the\r\nRhine Valley, at 300 m.p.h., an A.P. war correspondent reported.\r\nIntelligence officers believed at that time that the balls might be\r\nradar-controlled objects sent up to foul ignition systems or baffle\r\nAllied radar networks.\r\n\r\nThere is no explanation of their appearance here, unless the objects\r\ncould have been imported for secret tests in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nI read the last paragraph twice. This looked like a strong lead to the\r\nanswer, in spite of the Air Force denials. There was another, less\r\npleasant possibility. The Russians could have seized the device and\r\ndeveloped it secretly, using Nazi scientists to help them. Perhaps the\r\nNazis had been close to an atomic engine, even if they did fail to\r\nproduce the bomb.\r\n\r\nJack Daly came in while I was reading the story again.\r\n\r\n“I got the dope on Steele,” he said. “He does pieces for a small\r\nsyndicate, and I found out he was in the Air Force. I think he was a\r\ncaptain. People who know him say he’s O.K.—a straight shooter.”\r\n\r\n“That still wouldn’t keep him from giving me a fake tip, if somebody\r\ntold him it was the right thing to do.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe not,” said Jack, “but why would they want to plant this\r\nfoo-fighter idea?”\r\n\r\nI showed him the clipping. He read it over and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“That’s a lot different from disks three hundred feet in diameter.”\r\n\r\n“If we got the principle—or Russia did-building big ones might not be\r\ntoo hard.”\r\n\r\n“I still can’t swallow it,” said Jack. “These things have been seen all\r\nover the world. How could they control them that far away—and be sure\r\nthey wouldn’t crash, where somebody could get a look and dope out the\r\nsecret?”\r\n\r\nWe argued it back and forth without getting anywhere. “I’d give a lot\r\nto know Steele’s angle,” I said. “If you hear anything more on him,\r\ngive me a buzz.”\r\n\r\nJack nodded. “I’ll see what I can do. But I can’t dig too hard, or\r\nhe’ll hear about it.”\r\n\r\nOn the way out, I found a phone booth and called Splitt.\r\n\r\n“Foo fighters?” he said. “Sure, I remember those stories. You think\r\nthose are your flying saucers?”\r\n\r\nI could hear him snicker.\r\n\r\n“Just checking angles,” I said. “Didn’t the Eighth Air Force\r\ninvestigate the foo fighters?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and they found nothing to back up the pilots’ yarns. just war\r\nnerves, apparently.”\r\n\r\n“How about a look at the Intelligence report?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute.” Splitt was gone for twice that time, then he carne\r\nback. “Sorry, it’s classified.”\r\n\r\n“If all this stuff is bunk, why keep the lid on it?” I demanded. I was\r\ngetting sore again.\r\n\r\n“Look, Don,” said Splitt, “I don’t make the rules.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, I know—sorry,” I said. I had a notion to ask him if he knew John\r\nSteele, but hung up instead. There was no use in banging my head\r\nagainst the Air Force wall.\r\n\r\nThe next day I decided to analyze the Mantell case from beginning to\r\nend. It looked like the key to one angle: the question of an Air Force\r\nsecret missile. Unless there was some slip-up, so that Mantell and his\r\npilots had been ordered to chase the disk by mistake, then it would be\r\ncold murder.\r\n\r\nI couldn’t believe any Air Force officer would give such an order, no\r\nmatter how tremendous the secret to be hidden.\r\n\r\nBut I was going to find out, if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more than two weeks, I checked on the Godman Field tragedy. One\r\nfact stood out at the start: The death of Mantell had had a profound\r\neffect on many in the Air Force. A dozen times I was told:\r\n\r\n“I thought the saucers were a joke-until Mantell was killed chasing\r\nthat thing at Fort Knox.”\r\n\r\nMany ranking officers who had laughed at the saucer scare stopped\r\nscoffing. One of these was General Sory Smith, now Deputy Director of\r\nAir Force Public Relations. Later in my investigation, General Smith\r\ntold me:\r\n\r\n“It was the Mantell case that got me. I knew Tommy Mantell. very\r\nwell—also Colonel Hix, the C.O. at Godman. I knew they were both\r\nintelligent men—not the kind to be imagining things.”\r\n\r\nFor fifteen months, the Air Force kept a tight-lipped silence.\r\nMeantime, rumors began to spread. One report said that Mantell had been\r\nshot, his body riddled with bullets; his P-51, also riddled, had simply\r\ndisintegrated. Another rumor reported Mantell as having been killed by\r\nsome mysterious force; this same force had also destroyed his fighter.\r\nThe Air Force, the rumors said, had covered up the truth by telling\r\nMantell’s family he had blacked out from lack of oxygen.\r\n\r\nChecking the last angle, I found that this was the explanation given to\r\nMantell’s mother, just after his death, she was told by Standiford\r\nField officers that he had flown too high in chasing the strange\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nShallet, in the _Saturday Evening Post_ articles, described Project\r\n“Saucer’s” reconstruction of the case. Mantell was said to have climbed\r\nup to 25,000 feet, despite his firm decision to end the chase at\r\n20,000, since he carried no oxygen. Around 25,000 feet, Shallett quoted\r\nthe Air Force investigators, Mantell must have lost consciousness.\r\nAfter this, his pilotless plane climbed on up to some 30,000 feet, then\r\ndived. Between 20,000 and 10,000 feet, Shallett suggested, the P-51\r\nbegan to disintegrate, obviously from excessive speed. The gleaming\r\nobject that hypnotized Mantell into this fatal climb was, Shallett\r\nsaid, either the planet Venus or a Navy cosmic-ray research balloon.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force Project “Saucer” report of April 27, 1949, released just\r\nafter the first Post article, makes these statements:\r\n\r\n“Five minutes after Mantell disappeared from his formation, the two\r\nremaining planes returned to Godman. A few minutes later, one resumed\r\nthe search, covering territory 100 miles to the south as high as 33,000\r\nfeet, but found nothing.\r\n\r\n“Subsequent investigation revealed that Mantell had probably blacked\r\nout at 20,000 feet from lack of oxygen and had died of suffocation\r\nbefore the crash.\r\n\r\n“The mysterious object which the flyer chased to his death was first\r\nidentified as the Planet Venus. However, further probing showed the\r\nelevation and azimuth readings of Venus and the object at specified\r\ntime intervals did not coincide.\r\n\r\n“It is still considered ‘Unidentified.’\r\n\r\nThe Venus explanation, even though now denied, puzzled me. It was plain\r\nthat the Air Force had seriously considered offering it as the answer\r\nthen abandoned it. Apparently someone had got his signals mixed and let\r\nShallett use the discarded answer. And for some unknown reason, the Air\r\nForce had found it imperative to deny the Venus story at once.\r\n\r\nIn these first weeks of checking, I had run onto the Venus explanation\r\nin other cases. Several Air Force officers repeated it so quickly that\r\nit had the sound of a stock alibi. But in the daytime cases this was\r\nalmost ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI knew of a few instances in World War II when bomber crews and\r\nantiaircraft gunners had loosed a few bursts at Venus. But this was\r\nmostly at night, when the planet was at peak brilliance. And more than\r\none gunner later admitted firing to relieve long hours of boredom.\r\nSince enemy planes did not carry lights, there was no authentic case,\r\nto my knowledge, where plane or ground gunners actually believed Venus\r\nwas an enemy aircraft.\r\n\r\nChecking the astronomer’s report, I read over the concluding statement:\r\n\r\n“It simply could not have been Venus. They must have been desperate\r\neven to suggest it in the first place.” Months later, in the secret\r\nProject “Saucer” report released December 30, 1949, I found official\r\nconfirmation of this astronomer’s opinions. Since it has a peculiar\r\nbearing on the Mantell case, I am quoting it now:\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Venus is at its greatest brilliance, it is possible to see it\r\nduring daytime when one knows exactly where to look. But on January 7,\r\n1948, Venus was less than half as bright as its peak brilliance.\r\nHowever, under exceptionally good atmospheric conditions, and with the\r\neye shielded from direct rays of the sun, Venus might be seen as an\r\nexceedingly tiny bright point of light. . . . However, the chances of\r\nlooking at just the right spot are very few.\r\n\r\nIt has been unofficially reported that the object was a Navy cosmic-ray\r\nresearch balloon. If this can be established, it Is to be preferred as\r\nan explanation. However, if one accepts the assumption that reports\r\nfrom various other localities refer to the same object, any such device\r\nmust have been a good many miles high—25 to 50—in order to have been\r\nseen clearly, almost simultaneously, from places 175 miles apart.\r\n\r\nIf all reports were of a single object, in the knowledge of this\r\ninvestigator no man-made object could have been large enough and far\r\nenough away for the approximate simultaneous sightings. It is most\r\nunlikely, however, that so many separated persons should at that time\r\nhave chanced on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems therefore much more\r\nprobable that more than one object was involved.\r\n\r\nThe sighting might have included two or more balloons (or aircraft) or\r\nthey might have included Venus and balloons. For reasons given above,\r\nthe latter explanation seems more likely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo things stand out in his report:\r\n\r\n1. The obvious determination to fit some explanation, no matter how\r\nfarfetched, to the Mantell sighting.\r\n\r\n2. The impossibility that Venus—a tiny point of light, seen only with\r\ndifficulty—was the tremendous metallic object described by Mantell and\r\nseen by Godman Field officers.\r\n\r\nWith Venus eliminated, I went to work on the balloon theory. Since I\r\nhad been a balloon pilot before learning to fly planes, this was fairly\r\nfamiliar ground.\r\n\r\nShallett’s alternate theory that Mantell had chased a Navy research\r\nballoon was widely repeated by readers unfamiliar with balloon\r\noperation. Few thought to check the speeds, heights, and distances\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nCosmic-ray research balloons are not powered; they are set free to\r\ndrift with the wind. This particular Navy type is released at a base\r\nnear Minneapolis. The gas bag is filled with only a small per cent of\r\nits helium capacity before the take-off.\r\n\r\nIn a routine flight, the balloon ascends rapidly to a very high\r\naltitude-as high as 100,000 feet. By this time the gas bag has swelled\r\nto full size, about l00 feet high and 70 feet in diameter. At a set\r\ntime, a device releases the case of instruments under the balloon. The\r\ninstruments descend by parachute, and the balloon, rising quickly,\r\nexplodes from the sudden expansion.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a balloon starts leaking, and it then remains relatively\r\nlow. At first glance, this might seem the answer to the Kentucky\r\nsightings. If the balloon were low enough, it would loom up as a large\r\ncircular object, as seen from directly below. Some witnesses might\r\nestimate its diameter as 250 feet or more, instead of its actual 70\r\nfeet. But this failure to recognize a balloon would require incredibly\r\npoor vision on the part of trained observers—state police, Army M.P.’s,\r\nthe Godman Field officers, Mantell and his pilots.\r\n\r\nCaptain Mantell was a wartime pilot, with over three thousand hours in\r\nthe air. He was trained to identify a distant enemy plane in a split\r\nsecond. His vision was perfect, and so was that of his pilots. In broad\r\ndaylight they could not fail to recognize a balloon during their\r\nthirty-minute chase.\r\n\r\nColonel Hix and the other Godman officers watched the object with\r\nhigh-powered glasses for long periods. It is incredible that they would\r\nnot identify it as a balloon.\r\n\r\nBefore its appearance over Godman Field, the leaking balloon would have\r\ndrifted, at a low altitude, over several hundred miles. (A leak large\r\nenough to bring it down from high altitude would have caused it to land\r\nand be found.) Drifting at a low altitude, it would have been seen by\r\nseveral hundred thousand people, at the very least. Many would have\r\nreported it as a balloon. But even if this angle is ignored it still\r\ncould not possibly have been a balloon at low altitude. The fast flight\r\nfrom Madisonville, the abrupt stop and hour-long hovering at Godman\r\nField, the quick bursts of speed Mantell reported make it impossible.\r\nTo fly the go miles from Madisonville to Fort Knox in 30 minutes, a\r\nballoon would require a wind of 180 m.p.h. After traveling at this\r\nhurricane speed, it would then have had to come to a dead stop above\r\nGodman Field. As the P-51’s approached, it would have had to speed tip\r\nagain to 180, then to more than 360 to keep ahead of Mantell.\r\n\r\nThe three fighter pilots chased the mysterious object for half an hour.\r\n(I have several times chased balloons with a plane, overtaking them in\r\nseconds.) In a straight chase, Mantell would have been closing in at\r\n360; the tail wind acting on his fighter would nullify the balloon’s\r\nforward drift.\r\n\r\nBut even if you accept these improbable factors, there is one final\r\nfact that nullifies the balloon explanation. The strange object had\r\ndisappeared when Mantell’s wingman searched the sky, just after the\r\nleader’s death. If it had been a balloon held stationary for an hour at\r\na high altitude, and glowing brightly enough to be seen through clouds,\r\nit would have remained visible in the same general position. Seen from\r\n33,000 feet, it would have been even brighter, because of the clearer\r\nair.\r\n\r\nBut the mysterious object had completely vanished in those few minutes.\r\nA search covering a hundred miles failed to reveal a trace.\r\n\r\nWhether at a high or low altitude, a balloon could not have escaped the\r\npilot’s eyes. It would also have continued to be seen at Godman Field\r\nand other points, through occasional breaks in the clouds.\r\n\r\nI pointed out these facts to one Air Force officer at the Pentagon.\r\nNext day he phoned me:\r\n\r\n“I figured it out. The timing device went off and the balloon exploded.\r\nThat’s why the pilot didn’t see it.”\r\n\r\n“It’s an odd coincidence,” I said, “that it exploded in those five\r\nminutes after Mantell’s last report.”\r\n\r\n“Even so, it’s obviously the answer,” he said.\r\n\r\nChecking on this angle, I found:\r\n\r\n1. No one in the Kentucky area had reported a descending parachute.\r\n\r\n2. No cosmic-ray research instrument case or parachute was found in the\r\narea.\r\n\r\n3. No instruments were returned to the Navy from this region. And _all_\r\nballoons and instruments released at that time were _fully accounted\r\nfor_.\r\n\r\nEven if it had been a balloon, it would not explain the _later_ January\r\n7th reports—the simultaneous sightings mentioned by Professor Hynek in\r\nthe Project “Saucer” report. This includes the thing seen at Lockbourne\r\nAir Force Base two hours after Mantell’s death.\r\n\r\nObviously, the saucer seen flying at 500 m.p.h. over Lockbourne Field\r\ncould not have been a balloon. Even if there had been several balloons\r\nin this area (and there were not, by official record), they could not\r\nhave covered the courses reported. In some cases, they would have been\r\nflying against the wind, at terrific speed.\r\n\r\nThen what was the mysterious object? And what killed Mantell?\r\n\r\nBoth the Air Force and the _Post_ articles speculate that Mantell\r\ncarelessly let himself black out.\r\n\r\nSince some explanation had to be given, this might seem a good answer.\r\nBut Mantell was known for coolheaded judgment. As a wartime pilot, he\r\nwas familiar with signs of anoxia (oxygen starvation). That he knew his\r\ntolerance for altitude is proved by his firmly declared intention to\r\nabandon the chase at 20,000 feet, since he had no oxygen equipment.\r\n\r\nMantell had his altimeter to warn him. From experience, he would\r\nrecognize the first vague blurring, narrowing of vision, and other\r\nsigns of anoxia. Despite this, the “blackout” explanation was accepted\r\nas plausible by many Americans.\r\n\r\nWhile investigating the Mantell case, I talked with several pilots and\r\naeronautical engineers. Several questioned that a P-51 starting a dive\r\nfrom 20,000 feet would have disintegrated so thoroughly.\r\n\r\n“From thirty thousand feet, yes,” said one engineer. “If the idea was\r\nto explain it away, I’d pick a high altitude to start from. But a\r\npilotless plane doesn’t necessarily dive, as you know.\r\n\r\n“It might slip off and spin, or spiral down, and a few have even landed\r\nthemselves. Also, if the plane started down from twenty thousand, the\r\npilot wouldn’t be too far blacked out. The odds are he’d come to when\r\nhe got into thicker air—admitting he did blur out, which is only an Air\r\nForce guess. I don’t see why they’re so positive Mantell died before he\r\nhit the ground—unless they know something we don’t.”\r\n\r\nOne of the pilot group put it more bluntly.\r\n\r\n“It looks like a cover-up to me. I think Mantell did just what he said\r\nhe would—close in on the thing. I think he either collided with it, or\r\nmore likely they knocked him out of the air. They’d think he was trying\r\nto bring them down, barging in like that.”\r\n\r\nEven if you accept the blackout answer, it still does not explain what\r\nMantell was chasing. it is possible that, excited by the huge,\r\nmysterious object, he recklessly climbed beyond the danger level,\r\nthough such an act was completely at odds with his character.\r\n\r\nBut the _identity_ of the thing remains—officially—a mystery. If it was\r\nsome weird experimental craft or a guided missile, then whose was it?\r\nAir Force officers had repeatedly told me they had no such device.\r\nGeneral Carl Touhy Spaatz, former Air Force chief, had publicly\r\ninsisted that no such weapon had been developed in his regime.\r\nSecretary Symington and General Hoyt Vandenberg, present Air Force\r\nchief, had been equally emphatic. Of course, official denials could be\r\nexpected if it were a top-level secret. But if it were a secret device,\r\nwould it be tested so publicly that thousands would see it?\r\n\r\nIf it were an Air Force device, then I could see only one answer for\r\nthe Godman Field incident: The thing was such a closely guarded secret\r\nthat even Colonel Hix hadn’t known. That would mean that most or all\r\nAir Force Base C.O.’s were also in ignorance of the secret device.\r\n\r\nCould it be a Navy experiment, kept secret from the Air Force?\r\n\r\nI did a little checking.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Calvin Bolster, chief of aeronautics research experimental\r\ncraft, was an Annapolis classmate of mine. So was Captain Delmer S.\r\nFahrney, head of the Navy guided-missile program. Fahrney was at Point\r\nMugu, missile-testing base in California, and I wasn’t able to see him.\r\nBut I knew him as a careful, conscientious officer; I can’t believe he\r\nwould let such a device, piloted or not, hover over an Air Force base\r\nwith no warning to its C.O.\r\n\r\nI saw Admiral Bolster. His denial seemed genuine; unless he’d got to be\r\na dead-pan poker player since our earlier days, I was sure he was\r\ntelling the truth.\r\n\r\nThe only other alternate was Russia. It was incredible that they would\r\ndevelop such a device and then expose it to the gaze of U.S. Air Force\r\nofficers. It could be photographed, its speed and maneuverability\r\nchecked; it might crash, or antiaircraft fire might bring it down, The\r\nsecret might be lost in one such test flight.\r\n\r\nThere was one other explanation: The thing was not intended to be seen;\r\nit had got out of control. In this event; the long hovering period at\r\nGodman Field was caused by the need for repairs inside the flying\r\nsaucer, or repairs to remote-control apparatus.\r\n\r\nIf it were Air Force or Navy, that would explain official concern; even\r\nif completely free of negligence, the service responsible would be\r\nblamed for Mantell’s death. If it were Russian, the Air Force would of\r\ncourse try to conceal the fact for fear of public hysteria.\r\n\r\nBut if the device was American, it meant that Project “Saucer” was a\r\ncover-up unit. While pretending to investigate, it would actually hush\r\nup reports, make false explanations, and safeguard the secret in every\r\npossible way. Also, the reported order for Air Force pilots to pursue\r\nthe disks would have to be a fake. Instead, there would be a secret\r\norder telling them to avoid strange objects in the sky.\r\n\r\nBy the time I finished my check-up, I was sure of one thing: This\r\nparticular saucer had been real.\r\n\r\nI was almost positive of one other point-that the thing had been over\r\n30 miles high during part of its flight. I found that _after_ Mantell’s\r\ndeath it was reported simultaneously from Madisonville, Elizabethtown,\r\nand Lexington—over a distance of 175 miles. (Professor Hynek’s analysis\r\nlater confirmed this.)\r\n\r\nHow low it had been while hovering over Godman, and during Mantell’s\r\nchase, there was no way to determine. But all the evidence pointed to a\r\nswift ascent after Mantell’s last report.\r\n\r\nHad Mantell told Godman Tower more than the Air Force admitted? I went\r\nback to the Pentagon and asked for a full transcript of the flight\r\nleader’s radio messages. I got a quick turn-down. The reports, I was\r\ntold, were still classified as secret. Requests for pictures of the\r\nP-51 wreckage, and for a report on the condition of Mantell’s body,\r\nalso drew a blank. I had heard that some photographs were taken of the\r\nGodman Field saucer from outside the tower. But the Air Force denied\r\nknowledge of any such pictures.\r\n\r\nPuzzling over the riddle, I remembered John Steele, the former\r\nIntelligence captain. If by any chance he was a plant, it would be\r\ninteresting to suggest the various answers and watch his reaction. When\r\nI phoned him to suggest luncheon, Steele accepted at once. We met at\r\nthe Occidental, on Pennsylvania Avenue. Steele was younger than I had\r\nexpected—not over twenty-five. He was a tall man, with a crew haircut\r\nand the build of a football player. Looking at him the first time, I\r\nexpected a certain breeziness. instead, he was almost solemn.\r\n\r\n“I owe you an apology,” he said in a careful voice after we’d ordered.\r\n“You probably know I’m a syndicate writer?”\r\n\r\nI wondered if he’d found out Jack Daly was checking on him.\r\n\r\n“When you mentioned the Press Club,” I said, “I gathered you were in\r\nthe business.”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you thought I was fishing for a lead.” Steele looked at me\r\nearnestly. “I’m not working on the story—I’m tied up on other stuff.”\r\n\r\n“Forget it,” I told him.\r\n\r\nHe seemed anxious to reassure me. “I’d been worried for some time about\r\nthe saucers. I called you that night on an impulse.”\r\n\r\n“Glad you did,” I said. “I need every tip I can get.”\r\n\r\n“Did it help you any?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, though it still doesn’t fit together. But I can tell you this:\r\nThe saucers are real, or at least one of them.”\r\n\r\n“Which one?”\r\n\r\n“The thing Captain Mantell was chasing near Fort Knox, before he died.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that one.” Steele looked down at the roll he was buttering. “I\r\nthought that case was fully explained. Wasn’t he chasing a balloon?”\r\n\r\n“The Air Force says it’s still unidentified.” I told him what I had\r\nlearned. “Apparently you’re right—it’s either an American or a Soviet\r\nmissile.”\r\n\r\n“After what you’ve told me,” said Steele, “I can’t believe it’s ours.\r\nIt must be Russian.”\r\n\r\n“They’d be pretty stupid to test it over here.”\r\n\r\n“You said it was probably out of control.”\r\n\r\n“That particular one, maybe. But there have been several hundred seen\r\nover here. If they found their controls were haywire, they wouldn’t\r\nkeep testing the things until they’d corrected that.”\r\n\r\nThe waiter came with the soup, and Steele was silent until he left.\r\n\r\n“I still can’t believe it’s our weapon,” he said slowly. “They wouldn’t\r\nhave Air Force pilots alerted to chase the things. And I happen to how\r\nthey do.”\r\n\r\n“There’s something queer about this missile angle,” I said. “That\r\nsaucer was seen at the same time by people a hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles apart. To be that high in the sky, and still look more than two\r\nhundred and fifty feet in diameter, it must have been enormous.”\r\n\r\nSteele didn’t answer for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Obviously, that was an illusion,” he finally answered. “I’d discount\r\nthose estimates.”\r\n\r\n“Even Mantell’s? And the Godman Field officers’?”\r\n\r\n“Not knowing the thing’s height, how could they judge accurately?”\r\n\r\n“To be seen at points that far apart, it had to be over thirty miles\r\nhigh,” I told him. “It would have to be huge to show up at all.”\r\n\r\nHe shook his head. “I can’t believe those reports are right. It must\r\nhave been sighted at different times.”\r\n\r\nI let it drop.\r\n\r\n“What are you working on now?” Steele asked, after a minute or two.\r\n\r\nI said I hadn’t decided. Actually, I planned a trip to the coast, to\r\ninterview pilots who had sighted flying disks.\r\n\r\n“What would you do if you found it wasn’t a Soviet missile?” said\r\nSteele. He sounded almost too casual.\r\n\r\n“If security was involved, I’d keep still. But the Air Force and the\r\nNavy swear they haven’t any such things.”\r\n\r\nSteele looked at me thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“You know, _True_ might force something into the open that would be\r\nbetter left secret.” He smiled ironically. “I realize that sounds\r\npeculiar, since I suggested the Russian angle. But if it isn’t\r\nRussian—though I still think it is—then we have nothing to worry\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\nI was almost sure now that he was a plant. During the rest of the\r\nluncheon, I tried to draw him out, but Steele was through talking. When\r\nwe parted, he gave me a sober warning.\r\n\r\n“You and _True_ should consider your moral responsibility, no matter\r\nwhat you find. Even if it’s not actual security, there may be reasons\r\nto keep still.”\r\n\r\nAfter he left me, I tried to figure it out. If the Air Force was back\r\nof this, they must not think much of my intelligence. Or else they had\r\nbeen in such a hurry to get a line on _True’s_ investigation that they\r\nhad no choice but to use Steele. Of course, it was still possible he\r\nwas doing this on his own.\r\n\r\nEither way, his purpose was obvious. He hoped to have us swallow the\r\nSoviet-missile answer. If we did, then we would have to keep still,\r\neven though we found absolute proof. Obviously, it would be dangerous\r\nto print _that_ story.\r\n\r\nThinking back, I recalled Steele’s apparent attempt to dismiss the\r\nMantell case. I was convinced now. The Godman Field affair must hold an\r\nimportant clue that I had overlooked. It might even be the key to the\r\nwhole flying saucer riddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after my talk with Steele, I flew to the Coast. For three weeks\r\nI investigated sightings that had been reported by airline and private\r\npilots and other competent witnesses.\r\n\r\nAt first, the airline pilots were reluctant to talk. Most of them\r\nremembered the ridicule that had followed published accounts by other\r\nairline men. One pilot told me he had been ordered to keep still about\r\nhis experience—whether by the company or the Air Force, he would not\r\nsay. But most of them finally agreed to talk, if I kept their names out\r\nof print.\r\n\r\nOne airline captain—I’ll call him Blake—had encountered a saucer at\r\nnight. He and his copilot had sighted the object, gleaming, in the\r\nmoonlight, half a mile to their left.\r\n\r\n“We were at about twelve thousand feet,” he said, when we saw this\r\nthing pacing us. It didn’t have any running lights, but we could see\r\nthe moonlight reflecting from something like bright metal. There was a\r\nglow along the side, like some kind of light, or exhaust.”\r\n\r\n“Could you make out the shape?” I asked.\r\n\r\nBlake grinned crookedly. “You think we didn’t try? I cut in toward it.\r\nIt turned in the same direction. I pulled up about three hundred feet,\r\nand it did the same. Finally, I opened my throttles and cut in fast,\r\nintending to pull tip if we got too close. I needn’t have worried. The\r\nthing let out a burst of reddish flame and streaked up out of sight. It\r\nwas gone in a few seconds.”\r\n\r\n“Then it must have been piloted,” I said.\r\n\r\n“If not, it had some kind of radar-responder unit to make it veer off\r\nwhen anything got near it. It matched every move I made, until the last\r\none.”\r\n\r\nI asked him what he thought the saucer was. Blake hesitated, then he\r\ngave me a slow grin.\r\n\r\n“Well, my copilot thinks it was a space ship. He says no pilot here on\r\nearth could take that many G’s, when the thing zoomed.”\r\n\r\nI’d heard some “men from Mars” opinions about the saucers, but this was\r\nan experienced pilot.\r\n\r\n“You don’t believe that?” I said.\r\n\r\n“No,” Blake said. “I figure it was some new type of guided missile. If\r\nit took as many G’s as Chuck, my copilot, thinks, then it must have\r\nbeen on a beam and remote-controlled.”\r\n\r\nLater, I found two other pilots who had the same idea as Chuck. One\r\ncaptain was afraid the flying saucers were Russian; his copilot thought\r\nthey were Air Force or Navy. I met one airline official who was\r\nindignant about testing such missiles near the airways.\r\n\r\n“Even if they do have some device to make them veer off,” he said, “I\r\nthink it’s a risk. There’ll be hell to pay if one ever hits an\r\nairliner.”\r\n\r\n“They’ve been flying around for two years,” a line pilot pointed out.\r\n“Nobody’s had a close call yet. I don’t think there’s much danger.”\r\n\r\nWhen I left the Coast, I flew to New York. Ken Purdy called in John\r\nDuBarry, _True’s_ aviation editor, to hear the details. Purdy called\r\nhim “John the Skeptic.” After I told them what I had learned Purdy\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n“What do you think the saucers are?” asked DuBarry.\r\n\r\n“They must be guided missiles,” I said, “but it leaves some queer gaps\r\nin the picture.”\r\n\r\nI had made up a list of possible answers, and I read it to them:\r\n\r\n“One, the saucers don’t exist. They’re caused by mistakes, hysteria,\r\nand so on. Two, they’re Russian guided missiles. Three, they’re\r\nAmerican guided missiles. Four, the whole thing is a hoax, a\r\npsychological-warfare trick.”\r\n\r\n“You mean a trick of ours?” said Purdy.\r\n\r\n“Sure, to make the Soviets think we could reach them with a guided\r\nmissile. But I don’t think that’s the answer—I just listed it as a\r\npossibility.”\r\n\r\nDuBarry considered this thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, you’d have to bring thousands of people into the\r\nscheme, so the disks would be reported often enough to get publicity.\r\nYou’d have to have _some_ kind of device, maybe something launched from\r\nhighflying bombers, to give the rumors substance. They’d certainly do a\r\nbetter job than this, to put it over. And it wouldn’t explain the\r\nworld-wide sightings. Also, Captain Mantell wouldn’t kill himself just\r\nto carry out an official hoax.”\r\n\r\n“John’s right,” said Purdy. “Anyway, it’s too ponderous. It would leak\r\nlike a sieve, and the dumbest Soviet agent would see through it.”\r\n\r\nHe looked back at my list. “Cross off Number One, There’s too much\r\ncompetent testimony, beside the obvious fact that something’s being\r\ncovered up.”\r\n\r\n“That leaves Russian or American missiles,” I said, “as Steele first\r\nsuggested. But there are some points that just won’t fit the missile\r\ntheory.”\r\n\r\n“You’ve left out one answer,” said Purdy.\r\n\r\n“What’s that?”\r\n\r\n“Interplanetary.”\r\n\r\n“You’re kidding!” I said.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say I believed it,” said Purdy. “I just say it’s possible.”\r\n\r\nDuBarry was watching me. “I know how you feel. That’s how it hit me\r\nwhen Ken first said it,”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard it before,” I said. “But I never took it seriously.”\r\n\r\n“Maybe this will interest you,” Purdy said. He gave me a note from Sam\r\nBoal:\r\n\r\n“Just talked with D———-,” the note ran. (D———- is a prominent\r\naeronautical engineer, the designer of a world-famous plane.) “He\r\nbelieves the disks may be interplanetary and that the Air Force knows\r\nit—or at least suspects it. I’m enclosing sketches showing how he\r\nthinks the disks operate.”\r\n\r\n“He’s not the first one who told us that,” said Purdy. “We’ve heard the\r\nsame thing from other engineers. Over a dozen airline pilots think\r\nthey’re coining from out in space. And there’s a rocket expert at\r\nWright Field who’s warned Project ‘Saucer’ that the things are\r\ninterplanetary. That’s why I’m not writing it off.”\r\n\r\n“Have you read the Project ‘Saucer’ ideas on space travel?” DuBarry\r\nasked me. I told him my copy hadn’t reached me. He read me some marked\r\nparagraphs in his copy of the preliminary report:\r\n\r\n“‘There has been speculation that the aerial phenomena might actually\r\nbe some form of penetration from another planet . . . the existence of\r\nintelligent life on Mars is not impossible but is completely unproven .\r\n. . the possibility of intelligent life on the Planet Venus is not\r\nconsidered completely unreasonable by astronomers . . . Scientists\r\nconcede that living organisms might develop in chemical environments\r\nwhich are strange to us . . . in the next fifty years we will almost\r\ncertainly start exploring space . . . the chance of space travelers\r\nexisting at planets attached to neighboring stars is very much greater\r\nthan the chance of space-traveling Martians. The one can be viewed as\r\nalmost a certainty . . .’”\r\n\r\nDuBarry handed me the report. “Here—I practically know it by heart.\r\nTake it with you. You can send it back later.”\r\n\r\n“I know the space-travel idea sounds silly at first,” said Purdy, “but\r\nit’s the only answer that explains all the sightings-especially those\r\nin the last century.”\r\n\r\nHe asked DuBarry to give me their file of historic reports. While John\r\nwas getting it, Purdy went on:\r\n\r\n“Be careful about this man Steele. After what he said about ‘moral\r\nresponsibility’ I’m sure he’s planted.”\r\n\r\nI thought back to Steele’s warning. I told Purdy: “If he had the space\r\nthing in mind, maybe he’s right. It could set off a panic that would\r\nmake that Orson Welles thing look like a picnic.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly it could,” Purdy said. “We’d have to handle it carefully-if\r\nit turned out to be the truth. But I think the Air Force is making a\r\nmistake, if that’s what they’re hiding. It could break the wrong way\r\nand be serious.”\r\n\r\nJohn DuBarry came back with the file of old reports.\r\n\r\n“It might interest you to know,” he said, “that the Air Force checked\r\nall these old sightings too.”\r\n\r\nThe idea was still a difficult one for me to believe.\r\n\r\n“Those space-travel suggestions might be a trick,” I said. “The Air\r\nForce may be hinting at that to hide the guided-missile secret.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but later on they deny the space thing,” said Purdy. “It looks as\r\nif they’re trying to put people on guard and then play it down, so they\r\nwon’t get scared.”\r\n\r\nAs I put the historic reports file in my brief case, Purdy handed me a\r\nletter from an investigator named Hilton, who had been working in the\r\nSouthwest. I skimmed over his letter.\r\n\r\nHilton had heard of some unusual night sightings in New Mexico. The\r\nstory had been hushed up, but he had learned some details from a pilot\r\nat Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nOne of these mysterious “flying lights” had been seen at Las Vegas, on\r\nDecember 8, 1948—just one month before Mantell was killed in Kentucky.\r\nIt was too dark to make out the shape behind the light, but all\r\nwitnesses had agreed on its performance. The thing had climbed at\r\ntremendous speed, its upward motion shown by a bright green light.\r\nThough the green glow was much brighter than a plane’s running light,\r\nall plane schedules were carefully checked.\r\n\r\n“I think they were trying to pin it on a jet fighter,” the Albuquerque\r\npilot told Hilton. “But there weren’t any jets near there. Anyway, the\r\nthing climbed too fast. It must have been making close to nine hundred\r\nmiles an hour.”\r\n\r\nThe Air Force had also checked balloon release times—apparently just\r\nfor the record, since no balloon could even approach the saucer’s\r\nterrific ascent. Again, they drew a blank.\r\n\r\n“From the way this was hushed up,” Hilton commented, “they seem to be\r\nworried about this group of sightings. I’ve heard two reports that the\r\nF.B.I. is tied into the deal somehow, but that’s as far as I can get.”\r\n\r\n“See if you can get any lead on that,” Purdy told me. “That F.B.I.\r\nbusiness puzzles me. Where would they come in?”\r\n\r\nI said I would try to find out. But it was almost four months before we\r\nlearned the answer: The F.B.I. men had been _witnesses_. (This was\r\nlater admitted in an obscure cross-reference in the final Project\r\n“Saucer” report. But all official answers to the strange green-light\r\nsightings had been carefully omitted. The cases concerned were 223,\r\n224, 225, 226, 227, 230, and 231, which will be discussed later.)\r\n\r\n“When you go back to Washington,” said Purdy, “see what reaction you\r\nget to the interplanetary idea.”\r\n\r\nI had a pretty good idea what the reaction would be, but I nodded.\r\n“O.K. I’ll go flag a space ship and be on my way.”\r\n\r\n“O.K.—gag it up,” said Purdy. “But don’t sell it short, If by any\r\nchance it’s true, it’ll be the biggest story since the birth of\r\nChrist.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was dark when the airliner limousine reached La Guardia Field. I had\r\nintended taking an earlier plane, but DuBarry persuaded me to stay over\r\nfor dinner.\r\n\r\nWe dropped into the Algonquin, next door to _True’s_ office building.\r\nHalfway through dinner, I asked John what he thought of the\r\nspace-travel answer.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it’s possible,” he said cautiously. “The time and space angles\r\nmake it hard to take, but if we’re planning to explore space within\r\nfifty years, there’s no reason some other planet people couldn’t do it.\r\nOf course, if they’ve been observing us for over a century, as those\r\nold sightings seem to indicate, they must be far ahead of us, at least\r\nin technical progress.”\r\n\r\nLater on, he said thoughtfully, “Even though it’s possible, I hate to\r\nthink it’s the answer. just imagine the impact on the world. We’d have\r\nto reorient our whole lives—and things are complicated enough already.”\r\n\r\nStanding at the gate, waiting for my plane to be called, I thought over\r\nthat angle. Assuming that space travel was the solution—which I still\r\ncouldn’t believe-what would be the effect on the world?\r\n\r\nIt was a hard thing to picture. So much depended on the visitors from\r\nspace. What would their purpose be? Would they be peaceful or hostile?\r\nWhy had they been observing the earth so intensively in the past few\r\nyears?\r\n\r\nI could think of a hundred questions. What would the space people be\r\nlike? Would they be similar to men and women on earth, or some fearsome\r\nBuck Rogerish creatures who would terrify the average\r\nAmerican—including myself?\r\n\r\nIt was obvious they would be far superior to us in many ways. But their\r\ncivilization might be entirely different. Evolution might have\r\ndeveloped their minds, and possibly their bodies, along lines we\r\ncouldn’t even grasp. Perhaps we couldn’t even communicate with them.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the net effect of making contact with beings from a\r\ndistant planet? Would earthlings be terrified, or, if it seemed a\r\npeaceful exploration, would we bc intrigued by the thought of a great\r\nadventure? It would depend entirely on the space visitors’ motives, and\r\nhow the world was prepared for such a revelation.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought about it, the more fantastic thc thing seemed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it hadn’t been too long since airplane flight was considered an\r\nidiot’s dream. This scene here at La Guardia would have seemed pure\r\nfantasy in 1900—thc huge Constellations and DC-6’s; the double-decked\r\nStratocruisers, sweeping in from all over the country; the big ships at\r\nPan-American, taking off for points all over the globe. We’d come a\r\nlong way in the forty-six years since the Wright brothers’ first\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nBut space travel!\r\n\r\nThe gateman checked my ticket, and I went out to the Washington plane.\r\nIt was a luxury ship, a fifty-two-passenger, four-engined DC-6,\r\nscheduled to be in the capital one hour after take-off. By morning this\r\nplane, the Aztec, would be in Mexico City.\r\n\r\nThe couple going up the gangway ahead of me were in their late sixties.\r\nFifty years ago, what would they have said if someone had predicted\r\nthis flight? The answer to that was easy; at that time, high-school\r\nsongbooks featured a well-known piece entitled “Darius Green and His\r\nFlying Machine.” Darius, it seems, was a simple-minded lad who actually\r\nthought he could fly.\r\n\r\nFifty years. That was the time the Air Force had estimated it would\r\ntake us to start exploring space. Would Americans come to accept space\r\ntravel as matter-of-factly as the people now boarding this plane? The\r\nyoungsters would, probably; the older ones, as a rule, would be a\r\nlittle more cautious.\r\n\r\nIn the oval lounge at the rear of the plane, I took out the file of old\r\nsighting reports. Glancing through it, I, saw excerpts from\r\nnineteenth-century astronomical and scientific journals and extracts\r\nfrom official gazettes. Most of the early sightings had been in Great\r\nBritain and on the Continent, with a few reports scattered around the\r\nworld. The American reports did not begin until the latter part of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe DC-6 rolled out and took off. For a few minutes I watched the\r\nlights of Manhattan and Greater New York twinkling below. The Empire\r\nState Building tower was still above us, as the plane banked over the\r\nEast River.\r\n\r\nWe climbed quickly, and the familiar outline of Manhattan took shape\r\nlike a map pin-pointed with millions of lights.\r\n\r\nAny large city seen from the air at night has a certain magic, New York\r\nmost of all. Looking down, I thought: What would a spaceman think,\r\nseeing this brilliantly lighted city, the towering skyscrapers? Would\r\nother planets have such cities, or would it be something new and\r\npuzzling to a visitor from space?\r\n\r\nTurning back to the old reports, I skipped through until I found the\r\nAmerican sightings. One of the first was an incident at Bonham, Texas,\r\nin the summer of 1873.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight when a strange, fast-moving object appeared in\r\nthe sky, southwest of the town. For a moment, the people of Bonham\r\nstared at the thing, not believing their eves. The only flying device\r\nthen known was the drifting balloon. But this thing was tremendous, and\r\nspeeding so fast its outlines were almost a blur.\r\n\r\nTerrified farmers dived under their wagons. Townspeople fled indoors.\r\nOnly a few hardy souls remained in the streets. The mysterious object\r\ncircled Bonham twice, then raced off to the cast and vanished.\r\nDescriptions of the strange machine varied from round or oval to\r\ncigar-shaped. (The details of the Bonham sighting were later confirmed\r\nfor me by Frank Edwards, Mutual network newscaster, who investigated\r\nthis case.)\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after the Bonham incident, a device of the same\r\ndescription appeared at Fort Scott, Kansas. Panic-stricken soldiers\r\nfled the parade ground as the thing flashed overhead. In a few seconds\r\nit disappeared, circling toward the north.\r\n\r\nUntil now, I had supposed that the term “saucer” was original with\r\nKenneth Arnold. Actually, the first to compare a flying object with a\r\nsaucer was John Martin, a farmer who lived near Denison, Texas. The\r\nDenison Daily News of January 25, 1878, gives the following account:\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. John Martin, a farmer who lives some six miles south of this\r\ncity, we learn the following strange story: Tuesday morning while out\r\nhunting, his attention was directed to a dark object high up in the\r\nsouthern sky. The peculiar shape and velocity with which the object\r\nseemed to approach riveted his attention and he strained his eves to\r\ndiscover its character.\r\n\r\nWhen first noticed, it appeared to be about the size of an orange,\r\nwhich continued to grow in size. After gazing at it for some time Mr.\r\nMartin became blind from long looking and left off viewing it for a\r\ntime in order to rest his eyes. On resuming his view, the object was\r\nalmost overhead and had increased considerably in size, and appeared to\r\nbe going through space at wonderful speed.\r\n\r\nWhen directly over him it was about the size of a large saucer and was\r\nevidently at great height. Mr. Martin thought it resembled, as well as\r\nhe could judge, a balloon. It went as rapidly as it had come and was\r\nsoon lost to sight in the heavenly skies. Mr. Martin is a gentleman of\r\nundoubted veracity and this strange occurrence, if it was not a\r\nballoon, deserves the attention of our scientists.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the file, I saw a memo DuBarry had written:\r\n\r\n“I would take the very early reports with caution. For instance, the\r\none on August 9, 1762, which describes an odd, spindle-shaped body\r\ntraveling at high speed toward the sun. I recall that Charles Fort\r\naccepted this, along with other early sightings, as evidence of space\r\nships. But this particular thing might have been a meteor—meteors as\r\nsuch were almost unknown then. The later reports are more convincing,\r\nand it is also easier to check the sources, especially those from 1870\r\non.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1762 to 1870, the reports were meager. Some described mysterious\r\nlights in the sky; a few mentioned round objects seen in daylight. Even\r\nthough they were not so fully documented as later ones, one point\r\nstruck me. In those days, there was no telegraph, telephone, or radio\r\nto spread news rapidly and start a flood of rumors. A sighting in\r\nScotland could not be the cause of a similar one two days later in the\r\nsouth of France.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 870, there was a series of reports that went on to the\r\nturn of the century. In the London _Times_, September 26, 1870, there\r\nwas a description of a queer object that was seen crossing the moon. It\r\nwas reported as elliptical, with some kind of tail, and it took almost\r\nthirty seconds to complete its passage of the moon. Then in 1871, a\r\nlarge, round body was sighted above Marseilles, France. This was on\r\nAugust 1. It moved slowly across the sky, apparently at great height,\r\nand was visible about fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nOn March 22, 1880, several brilliantly luminous objects were reported\r\nseen at Kattenau, Germany. Sighted just before sunrise, they were\r\ndescribed as rising from the horizon and moving from east to west. The\r\naccount was published in the _British Nature Magazine_, Volume 22, page\r\n64.\r\n\r\nThe next report in the file mentioned briefly a strange round object\r\nseen in the skies over Bermuda. The source for this account was the\r\nBermuda Royal Gazette. This was in 1885. That same year, an astronomer\r\nand other witnesses reported a gigantic aerial object at Adrianople,\r\nTurkey. On November 1, the weird apparition was seen moving across the\r\nsky. Observers described it as round and four to five times the size of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nThis estimate is similar to the Denison, Texas, comparison with an\r\norange. The object would actually be huge to be seen at any great\r\nheight. But unless the true height were known, any estimate of size\r\nwould be guesswork.\r\n\r\nOn March 19, 1887, two strange objects fell into the sea near a Dutch\r\nbarkentine. As described by the skipper, Captain C. D. Sweet, one of\r\nthe objects was dark, the other brightly luminous. The glowing object\r\nfell with a loud roaring sound; the shipmaster was positive it was not\r\na meteor.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, a year later, an oval-shaped disk was reported speeding\r\nhigh overhead. This was on May 4, 1888. About two years after this,\r\nseveral large aerial bodies were sighted hovering over the Dutch East\r\nIndies.\r\n\r\nMost accounts described them as roughly triangular, about one hundred\r\nfeet on the base and two hundred feet on the sides. But some observers\r\nthought they might be longer and narrower, with a rounded base; this\r\nwould make them agree with more recent stories of cone-shaped objects\r\nwith rounded tops seen in American skies.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 1894, a British admiral reported sighting a large disk\r\nwith a projection like a tail. And a year after this, both England and\r\nScotland buzzed with stories of triangular-shaped objects like those\r\nseen in the Dutch East Indies. Although many officials scoffed at the\r\nstories, more than one astronomer stuck to his belief that the\r\nmysterious things might be coming from outer space. Since planes and\r\ndirigibles were then unknown, there was no one on earth who could have\r\nbeen responsible for them.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, sightings in the United States began to be more frequent. One\r\nof the strangest reports describes an incident that began on April 9.\r\nFlying at a great height, a huge cigar-shaped device was seen in the\r\nMidwest. Short wings projected from the sides of the object, according\r\nto reports of astronomers who watched it through telescopes.\r\n\r\nFor almost a week, the aerial visitor was sighted around the Midwest,\r\nas far south as St. Louis and as far west as Colorado. Several times,\r\nred, green, and white lights were seen to flash in the sky; some\r\nwitnesses thought the crew of this strange craft might be trying to\r\nsignal the earth.\r\n\r\nOn April 16, the thing, whatever it was, disappeared from the Midwest.\r\nBut on April 19, the same object—or else a similar one—appeared over\r\nWest Virginia. Early that morning the town of Sisterville was awakened\r\nby blasts of the sawmill whistle. Those who went outside their homes\r\nsaw a strange sight. From a torpedo-shaped object overhead, dazzling\r\nsearchlights were pointing downward, sweeping the countryside. The\r\nthing appeared to be about two hundred feet long, some thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, with stubby wings and red and green lights along the sides.\r\nFor almost ten minutes the aerial visitor circled the town, then it\r\nswung eastward and vanished.\r\n\r\nThe next report was published in the U.S. Weather Bureau’s monthly\r\n_Weather Review_. On page 115 in the March 1904 issue, there is an\r\naccount of an odd sighting at sea. On February 24, 1904, a mysterious\r\nlight had been seen above the Atlantic by crew members of the U.S.S.\r\n_Supply_. It was moving swiftly, and evidently at high altitude. The\r\nreport was attested by Lieutenant Frank H. Schofield, U.S.N.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 1907, a mysterious explosion occurred, in the heavens near\r\nBurlington, Vermont. Some witnesses described a strange, torpedo-shaped\r\ndevice circling above. Shortly after it was seen, a round, luminous\r\nobject flashed down from the sky, then exploded, (_Weather Review_,\r\n1907, page 310.)\r\n\r\nAnother cigar-shaped craft was reported at a low altitude over\r\nBridgewater, Massachusetts, in 1905. Like the one at Sisterville, it\r\ncarried searchlights, which swept back and forth across the\r\ncountryside. After a few moments, the visitor rose in a steep climb,\r\nand the searchlights blinked out.\r\n\r\nThere was no report for 1909 in America, though an odd aerial object\r\nwas sighted near the Galapagos Islands. But in 1910, one January\r\nmorning, a large silvery cigar-shaped device startled Chattanooga.\r\nAfter about five minutes, the thing sped away, appearing over\r\nHuntsville, Alabama, shortly afterward. It made a second appearance\r\nover Chattanooga the next day, then headed east and was never seen\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn _Popular Astronomy_, January 27, 1012, a Dr. F. B. Harris described\r\nan intensely black object that he saw crossing the moon. As nearly as\r\nhe could tell, it was gigantic in size—though again there was no way to\r\nbe sure of its distance from him or the moon. With careful\r\nunderstatement, Dr. Harris said, “I think a very interesting and\r\ncurious phenomenon happened that night.”\r\n\r\nA strange shadow was noted on the clouds at Fort Worth, Texas, on April\r\n8, 19, 3. It appeared to be caused by some large body hovering\r\nmotionless above the clouds. As the cloud layer moved, the shadow\r\nremained in the same position. Then it changed size, diminishing, and\r\nquickly disappeared, as if it had risen vertically. A report on this\r\nwas given in the Weather Bureau _Review_ of that year, Number 4-599.\r\n\r\nBy 1919, dirigibles were of course well known to most of the world.\r\nWhen a dirigible-shaped object appeared over Huntington, West Virginia,\r\nin July of that year, there was no great alarm. It was believed to be\r\nan American blimp, though the darkness—it was eleven at night—prevented\r\nobservers from being sure. But a later check-up proved it was not an\r\nAmerican ship, nor was it from any country possessing such craft.\r\n\r\nFor some time after this, there were few authentic reports. Then in\r\n1934, Nicholas Roerich, head of the American-Roerich expedition into\r\nTibet, had a remarkable experience that bears on the saucer riddle.\r\n\r\nOn pages 361 and 362 of his book _Altai Himalaya_, Roerich describes\r\nthe incident. The expedition party was in the wilds of Tibet one\r\nmorning when a porter noticed the peculiar actions of a buzzard\r\noverhead. He called Roerich’s attention to it; then they all saw\r\nsomething high in the sky, moving at great speed from north to south.\r\nWatching it through binoculars, Roerich saw it was oval-shaped,\r\nobviously of huge size, and reflecting the sun’s rays like brightly\r\npolished metal. While he trailed it with his glasses, the object\r\nsuddenly changed direction, from south to southwest. It was gone in a\r\nfew moments.\r\n\r\nThis was the last sighting listed before World War II.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, I stared out the plane window, curiously\r\ndisturbed. Like most people, I had grown up believing the earth was the\r\ncenter of everything—life, intelligence, and religion. Now, for the\r\nfirst time in my life, that belief was shaken.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious thing. I could accept the idea that we would\r\neventually explore space, land on the moon, and go on to distant\r\nplanets. I had read of the plans, and I knew our engineers and\r\nscientists would somehow find a way. It did not disturb my belief in\r\nour superiority.\r\n\r\nBut faced with this evidence of a superior race in the universe, my\r\nmind rebelled. For years, I had been accustomed to thinking in\r\ncomic-strip terms of any possible spacemen—Buck Rogers stuff, with\r\nweird-looking space ships and green-faced Martians.\r\n\r\nBut now, if these sightings were true, the shoe was on the other foot.\r\nWe would be faced with a race of beings at least two hundred years\r\nahead of our civilization—perhaps thousands. In their eyes, we might\r\nlook like primitives.\r\n\r\nMy conjectures before the take-off had just been idle thinking; I had\r\nnot really believed this could be the answer. But now the question came\r\nback sharply. How would we react to a sudden appearance of space ships,\r\nbringing that higher race to the earth? If we were fully prepared,\r\neducated to this tremendous adventure, it might come off without\r\ntrouble. Unprepared, we would be thrown into panic.\r\n\r\nThe lights of Philadelphia showed up ahead, and a thought struck me.\r\nWhat would Philadelphians of 1776 have thought to see this DC-6 flying\r\nacross their city at three hundred miles an hour? What would the\r\nsentries at Valley Forge have done, a year later, if this lighted\r\nairliner had streaked over their heads?\r\n\r\nMadness. Stampede. Those were the plain answers.\r\n\r\nBut there was a difference now. We had had modern miracles, radio,\r\ntelevision, supersonic planes, and the promise of still more miracles.\r\n_We_ could be educated, or at least partly prepared, to accept space\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nIn fifty years we had learned to fly. In fifty years more, we would be\r\nexploring space. Why should we believe such creative intelligence was\r\nlimited to the earth? It would be incredible if the earth, out of all\r\nthe millions of planets, proved the only inhabited spot in the whole\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nBut, instinctively, I still fought against believing that the flying\r\nsaucers were space ships. Eventually, we would make contact with races\r\non other planets; they undoubtedly would someday visit the earth. But\r\nif it could be put off . . . a problem for later generations to handle\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nIf the disks proved American guided missiles, it would be an easier\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nLooking through the Project “Saucer” report DuBarry had loaned me, I\r\nread the space-travel items, hoping to find some hint that this was a\r\nsmoke screen. On page 18, in a discussion on Mars, I found this\r\ncomment:\r\n\r\n“Reports of strange objects seen in the skies have been handed down\r\nthrough the generations. However, scientists believe that if Martians\r\nwere now visiting the earth without establishing contact, it could be\r\nassumed that they have just recently succeeded in space travel, and\r\nthat their civilization would be practically abreast of ours. This\r\nbecause they find it hard to believe that any technically established\r\nrace would come here, flaunt its ability in mysterious ways over the\r\nyears, but each time simply go way without ever establishing contact.”\r\n\r\nThere could be several answers to that. The Martians might not be able\r\nto live in our atmosphere, except in their sealed space ships. They, or\r\nsome other planet race, could have observed us periodically to check on\r\nour slow progress. Until we began to approach their level of\r\ncivilization, or in some way caused them concern, they would probably\r\nsee no reason for trying to make contact. But somehow I found a vague\r\ncomfort in the argument, full of holes though it was.\r\n\r\nSearching further, I found other space-travel comments. On one page,\r\nthe Air Force admitted it was almost a certainty that space travelers\r\nwould be operating from planets outside the solar system. But on the\r\nfollowing page, I discovered this sentence: “Thus, although visits from\r\nouter space are believed to be possible, they are thought to be highly\r\nimprobable.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the answer? Was this just a wandering discussion of\r\npossibilities, badly put together, or was it a hint of the truth? it\r\ncould be the first step in preparing America for a revelation. It could\r\nalso be a carefully thought-out trick.\r\n\r\nThis whole report might be designed to conceal a secret weapon. If the\r\nAir Force or the Navy did have a secret missile, what better way to\r\ndistract attention? The old sighting reports could have been seized on\r\nas a buildup for space travel hints.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly it hit me. Even if it were a smoke screen, what of those\r\nold reports? They still remained to be answered. There was only one\r\npossible explanation, unless you discarded the sightings as lies. That\r\nmeant discrediting many reliable witnesses—naval officers, merchant\r\nshipmasters, explorers, astronomers, ministers, and responsible public\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nBesides all these, there had been thousands of other witnesses, where\r\nlarge groups had seen the objects. The answer seemed inevitable, but I\r\nheld it off. I didn’t want to believe it, with all the changes it might\r\nbring, the unpredictable effect upon our civilization. If I kept on\r\nchecking I might find evidence that would bring a different explanation\r\nfor the present saucers.\r\n\r\nDuBarry had put another group of reports in the envelope; this series\r\ncovered the World War II phase and on up to the outbreak of the saucer\r\nscare in the United States. Some of it, about the foo fighters, I\r\nalready knew. This was tied in with the mystery rockets reported over\r\nSweden. The first Swedish sightings had occurred during the early part\r\nof the war. Most of the so-called “ghost rockets” were seen at night,\r\nmoving at tremendous speed. Since they came from the direction of\r\nGermany, most Swedes believed that guided rockets were the answer.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1946, after the Russians had taken over\r\nPeenemunde, the Nazi missile test base, ghost rockets again were\r\nreported flying over Sweden. Some were said to double back and fly into\r\nSoviet areas. Practically all were seen at night, and therefore none\r\nhad been described as a flying disk. Instead, they were said to be\r\ncolored lights, red, green, blue, and orange, often blurred from their\r\nhigh speed.\r\n\r\nBut there was a puzzling complication. Mystery lights, and sometimes\r\nflying disks, were simultaneously reported over Greece, Portugal,\r\nTurkey, Spain, and even French Morocco. Either there were _two_\r\nanswers, or some nation had developed missiles with an incredibly long\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nBy January 1947, ghost-rocket sightings in Europe had diminished to\r\nless than one a month. Oddly enough, the first disk report admitted by\r\nProject “Saucer” was in this same month. The first ’47 case detailed by\r\nProject “Saucer” occurred at Richmond, Virginia. It was about the\r\nmiddle of April. A Richmond weather observer had released a balloon and\r\nwas tracking it with a theodolite when a strange object crossed his\r\nfield of vision. He swung the theodolite and managed to track the\r\nthing, despite its high speed. (The actual speed and altitude—the\r\nlatter determined by a comparison of the balloon’s height at various\r\ntimes—have never been released. Nor has the Air Force released this\r\nobserver’s report on the object’s size, which Project “Saucer” admitted\r\nwas more accurate than most witnesses’ estimates.)\r\n\r\nAbout the seventeenth of May 1947, a huge oval-shaped saucer ten times\r\nlonger than its diameter was sighted by Byron Savage, an Oklahoma City\r\npilot. Two days later, another fast-flying saucer was reported at\r\nManitou Springs, Colorado. In the short time it was observed, it was\r\nseen to change direction twice, maneuvering at an unbelievable speed.\r\n\r\nThen on June 24 came Kenneth Arnold’s famous report, which set off the\r\nsaucer scare. The rest of the story I now knew almost by heart.\r\n\r\nWhen the DC-6 landed at Washington, I had made one decision. Since it\r\nwas impossible to check up on most of the old sightings, I would\r\nconcentrate on certain recent reports—cases in which the objects had\r\nbeen described as space ships.\r\n\r\nAs I waited for a taxi, I looked up at the sky. It was a clear summer\r\nnight, without a single cloud. Beyond the low hill to the west I could\r\nsee the stars.\r\n\r\nI can still remember thinking, _If it’s true, then the stars will never\r\nagain seem the same_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, in the broad light of day, the idea of space visitors\r\nsomehow had lost its menace. If the disks were space ships, at least\r\nthey had shown no sign of hostility, so far as I knew. Of course, there\r\nwas Mantell; but if he had been downed by some weapon on the disk, it\r\ncould have been self-defense. In most cases, the saucers retreated at\r\nthe first sign of pursuit.\r\n\r\nMy mind was still reluctant to accept the space-travel answer, in spite\r\nof the old reports. But I kept thinking of the famous aircraft designer\r\nwho thought the disks were space craft; the airline pilots Purdy had\r\nmentioned; Blake’s copilot, Chuck. . . .\r\n\r\nNow that I recalled it, Blake had been more embarrassed than seemed\r\ncalled for when he told about Chuck. Perhaps he had been the one who\r\nbelieved the saucers were space ships, instead of his absent copilot.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, I went over the list of sightings since June 1947.\r\nThere were several saucers that actually had been described as\r\nprojectile-like ships. The most famous of all was the Eastern Airlines\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIt was 8:30 P.M., July 23, 1948, when an Eastern Airlines DC-3 took off\r\nfrom Houston, Texas, on a flight to Atlanta and Boston. The airliner\r\ncaptain was Clarence S. Chiles. During the war, he had been in the Air\r\nTransport Command, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He had 8,500\r\nflying hours. His first officer was John B. Whitted, a wartime pilot on\r\nB-29’s. Both men were known in Eastern as careful, conservative pilots.\r\n\r\nIt was a bright, moonlit night, with scattered clouds overhead. The\r\nDC-3 was twenty miles west of Montgomery, at 2:45 A.M., when a\r\nbrilliant projectile-like craft came hurtling along the airway.\r\n\r\nChiles saw it first and took it to be a jet plane. But the next instant\r\nboth pilots saw that this was no jet fighter.\r\n\r\n“It was heading southwest,” Chiles said later, “exactly opposite to our\r\ncourse. Whatever it was, it flashed down toward us at terrific speed.\r\nWe veered to the left. It veered sharply, too, and passed us about\r\nseven hundred feet to the right. I saw then that it had no wings.”\r\n\r\nThe mystery ship passed on Whitted’s side, and he had a fairly close\r\nlook.\r\n\r\n“The thing was about one hundred feet long, cigar-shaped, and\r\nwingless,” he described it. “It was about twice the diameter of a\r\nB-twenty-nine, with no protruding fins.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Chiles said the cabin appeared like a pilot compartment, except\r\nfor its eerie brilliance. Both he and Whitted agreed it was as bright\r\nas a magnesium flare. They saw no occupants, but at their speed this\r\nwas not. surprising.\r\n\r\n“An intense dark-blue glow came from the side of the ship,” Chiles\r\nreported. (It was later suggested by engineers that the strange glare\r\ncould have come from a power plant of unusual type.) “It ran the entire\r\nlength of the fuselage—like a blue fluorescent light. The exhaust was a\r\nred-orange flame, with a lighter color predominant around the outer\r\nedges.”\r\n\r\nBoth pilots said the flame extended thirty to fifty feet behind the\r\nship. As it passed, Chiles noted a snout like a radar pole. Both he and\r\nWhitted glimpsed two rows of windows.\r\n\r\n“Just as it went by,” said Chiles, “the pilot pulled up as if he had\r\nseen the DC-three and wanted to avoid its. There was a tremendous burst\r\nof flame from the rear. It zoomed into the clouds, its jet wash rocking\r\nour DC-three.”\r\n\r\nChiles’s estimate of the mystery ship’s speed was between five hundred\r\nand seven hundred miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAs the object vanished, Chiles went back into the cabin to check with\r\nthe passengers. Most had been asleep or were drowsing. But one man\r\nconfirmed that they were in their right senses. This passenger,\r\nClarence McKelvie of Columbus, Ohio, told them (and a Project “Saucer”\r\nteam later) that he had seen a brilliant streak of light flash past his\r\nwindow. It had gone too swiftly for him to catch any details.\r\n\r\nThe A.P. interviewed Mr. McKelvie soon after he landed, and ran the\r\nfollowing story:\r\n\r\n“Kennett Square, Pa., July 24 (AP) . Clarence L. McKelvie, assistant\r\nmanaging editor of the American Education Press, said he was the only\r\npassenger on the EAL Houston-Boston plane who was not asleep when the\r\nphantom craft was sighted.\r\n\r\n“‘I saw no shape or form,’ Mr. McKelvie said. ‘I was on the right side\r\nof the plane, and suddenly I saw this strange eerie streak out of my\r\nwindow. It was very intense, not like lightning or anything I had ever\r\nseen.’\r\n\r\n“The Columbus man said he was too startled and the object moved too\r\nquickly for him to adjust his eyes to it.”\r\n\r\nIn Washington, Air Force officials insisted they could shed no light on\r\nthe mystery. Out in Santa Monica, General George C. Kenney, then chief\r\nof the Strategic Air Command, declared the Air Force had nothing\r\nremotely like the ship described.\r\n\r\n“I wish we did,” General Kenney told reporters. “I’d sure like to see\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\nThe publicized story of this “space ship” set off another scare—also\r\nthe usual cracks about screwball pilots. But Chiles and Whitted were\r\nnot screwballs; they were highly respected pilots. The passenger’s\r\nconfirmation added weight. But even if all three had been considered\r\ndeluded, the Air Force investigators could not get around the reports\r\nfrom Robbins Air Force Base.\r\n\r\nJust about one hour before the DC-3 incident, a strange flaming object\r\ncame racing southward through the night skies over Robbins Field, at\r\nMacon, Georgia. Observers at the air base were astounded to see what\r\nappeared to be a huge, wingless craft streak overhead, trailing a\r\nvaricolored exhaust. (The witnesses’ description tallied with those of\r\nChiles and Whitted.) The mystery ship vanished swiftly; all observers\r\nagreed that it disappeared from the line of sight just like a normal\r\naircraft.\r\n\r\nWhile I was working on this case, a contact in Washington gave me an\r\ninteresting tip.\r\n\r\n“Within forty-eight hours after that Eastern sighting, Air Force\r\nengineers rushed out blueprint plans and elevations of the ‘space\r\nship,’ based on what the two pilots told them.”\r\n\r\nWhether or not this was true, I found that the Air Force engineers did\r\ncompute the probable speed and lift of the mystery craft. The ship was\r\nfound to be within the bounds of aerodynamic laws for operations in our\r\natmosphere. Here is the Air Force statement:\r\n\r\n“Application of the Prandtl theory of lift indicated that a fuselage of\r\nthe dimensions reported by Chiles and Whitted could support a load\r\ncomparable to the weight of an aircraft of this size, at flying speeds\r\nin the sub-sonic range.” (This supports Chiles’s estimate of 500-700\r\nm.p.h.)\r\n\r\nFour days after the space-ship story was published, a Navy spokesman\r\nwas quoted as hinting it might have been a high-atmosphere rocket gone\r\nastray from the proving grounds in New Mexico. The brief report\r\nappeared on the editorial page of the Washington _Star_ on July 28,\r\n1947. It ran as follows:\r\n\r\n“The Navy says that naval technicians have been testing a\r\n3,000-mile-per-hour rocket in New Mexico. If one went astray, it could\r\ntravel across our continent in a short time.”\r\n\r\nAt first glance I thought this might be the real answer to the\r\nChiles-Whitted case. But after a few minutes I saw it was almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nFirst, rockets at White Sands are launched and controlled with utmost\r\ncare. There have been no reported cases of such a long-distance\r\nrunaway.\r\n\r\nSecond, if such a rocket had gone astray, it would certainly have\r\ncaused wild confusion at White Sands until they found where it landed.\r\nHundreds of people would have known about it; the story would be\r\ncertain to leak out.\r\n\r\nThird, such a rocket would have had to travel from White Sands to\r\nMacon, Georgia, then circle around south of this city for over forty\r\nminutes. (If it had kept on at the speed observed at Robbins Field, it\r\nwould have passed Montgomery long before the DC-3 reached the area.) In\r\naddition, the rocket would have had to veer sharply away from the\r\nairliner, as both pilots testified, and then zoom into the clouds. No\r\nhigh-atmosphere test rocket has automatic controls such as this would\r\nrequire. And if it had gone astray from White Sands, the station’s\r\nremote control would no longer be guiding it.\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Airlines “space ship,” then, was not just a fugitive\r\nrocket. But it could be a new type of aircraft, something\r\nrevolutionary, developed in absolute secrecy.\r\n\r\nOther airline pilots had reported flying disks racing along the\r\nairways, though none that I knew of had described projectile-like\r\nobjects. Chiles and Whitted insisted the mystery ship was not a disk,\r\nand the report from Robbins Field agreed on this point. Man-made\r\ndevices or not, it seemed fairly certain there was more than one type\r\nof saucer.\r\n\r\nThe more I studied the evidence, the harder it was to believe that this\r\nwas an earth-made ship. Such a wingless rocket ship would require\r\ntremendous jet power to keep it in the air. Even our latest jet bombers\r\ncould not begin to approach its performance.\r\n\r\nGoing back over the Project “Saucer” preliminary report, I found strong\r\nevidence that the Air Force was worried. In their investigation,\r\nProject teams had screened 225 military and civilian flight schedules.\r\nAfter nine months, they reported that the mysterious object was no\r\nconventional aircraft.\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 1949, the Air Force admitted that Project “Saucer” had\r\nfailed to find the answer. The “space ship” was officially listed as\r\nunidentified.\r\n\r\n“But Wright Field is still working on it,” an Air Force officer told\r\nme. “Both Chiles and Whitted are responsible pilots, and McKelvie has a\r\nreputation for making careful statements. Even without the Robbins\r\nField confirmation, no one could doubt that they saw something.”\r\n\r\nThe Chiles-Whitted “space ship” was not the first of this type to be\r\nreported. Another wingless aircraft was sighted in August 1947, by two\r\npilots for an Alabama flying service. It was at Bethel, Alabama, just\r\nafter sunset, when a huge black wingless craft swept across their\r\ncourse. Silhouetted against the evening sky, it loomed larger than a\r\nC-54. The pilots saw no wings, motors, or jet exhausts.\r\n\r\nSwinging in behind the mystery ship, they attempted to follow. But at\r\ntheir speed of 170 m.p.h. they were quickly outdistanced. Careful\r\nchecking showed there were no other planes nearby that could have been\r\nmistaken for this strange craft.\r\n\r\nOn New Year’s Day, 1948, a similar rocket-shaped object was sighted at\r\nJackson, Mississippi. It was first seen by a former Air Force pilot and\r\nhis passenger, and later by witnesses on the ground. Before the pilot\r\ncould begin to close in, the odd wingless ship pulled away. Speeding up\r\nfrom 200 to 500 m.p.h., it swiftly disappeared.\r\n\r\nBesides these two cases, already on record, I had the tips Purdy had\r\ngiven me. One wingless ship was supposed to have been seen three or\r\nfour days before the Chiles-Whitted sighting; like the thing they\r\nreported, the unidentified craft was a double-decked “space ship” but\r\nmoving at even higher speed. At first I ran into a stone wall trying to\r\ncheck this story. Then I found a lead conforming that this was a\r\nforeign report. It finally proved to be from The Hague.\r\n\r\nThe tip had been right. This double-decked, wingless ship had been\r\nsighted on July 20, 1948—four days before the Eastern case. Witnesses\r\nhad reported it at a high altitude, moving at fantastic speed.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this report, I verified another tip. We had heard a\r\nrumor of a space-ship sighting at Clark Field, in the Philippine\r\nIslands. Although I didn’t learn the date, I found that there was such\r\na record.\r\n\r\n(In the final Project “Saucer” report, the attempt to explain away this\r\nsighting was painfully evident. Analyzing this case, Number 206, the\r\nAir Force said: “If the facts are correct, there is no astronomical\r\nexplanation. A few points favor the daytime meteor\r\nhypothesis—snow-white color, speed faster than a jet, the roar,\r\nsimilarity to sky-writing and the time of day. But the tactics, if\r\nreally performed, oppose it strenuously: the maneuvers in and out of\r\ncloud banks, turns of 180 degrees or more, Possibly these were\r\nillusions, caused by seeing the object intermittently through clouds.\r\nThe impression of a fuselage with windows could even more easily have\r\nbeen a sign of imagination.”\r\n\r\n(With this conjecture, Project “Saucer” listed the sighting as\r\nofficially answered. The Hague space-ship case was unexplained.)\r\n\r\nIn following up the Jackson and Bethel reports, I talked with two\r\nofficials in the Civil Aeronautics Administration. One of these was\r\nCharley Planck, who handled public relations. I found that the pilots\r\nconcerned had good records; C.A.A. men who knew them discounted the\r\nhoax theory.\r\n\r\n“Charley, there’s a rumor that airline pilots have been ordered not to\r\ntalk,” I told Planck. “You know anything about it?”\r\n\r\n“You mean ordered by the Air Force or the companies?” he said.\r\n\r\n“The Air Force _and_ the C.A.A.”\r\n\r\n“If the C.A.A.’s in on it, it’s a top-level deal,” said Charley. “I\r\nthink it’s more likely the companies—with or without a nudge from the\r\nAir Force.”\r\n\r\nWhile we were talking, an official from another agency came in. Because\r\nthe lead he gave me was off the record, I’ll call him Steve Barrett. I\r\nknew Steve fairly well. We were both pilots with service training; our\r\npaths had crossed during the war, and I saw him now and then at\r\nairports around Washington.\r\n\r\nWhen the saucer scare first broke, Steve had been disgusted. “Damn\r\nfools trying to get publicity,” he snorted. “The way Americans fall for\r\na gag! Even the Air Force has got the jitters.”\r\n\r\nSo I was a little surprised to find he now thought the disks were real.\r\n\r\n“What sold you?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“The radar reports,” said Steve. “I know of half a dozen cases where\r\nthey’ve tracked the things. One was in Japan. The thing was climbing so\r\nfast no one believed the radarmen at first. Then they got some more\r\nreports. One was up in Canada. There was a case in New Mexico, and I\r\nthink a Navy destroyer tracked a saucer up in the North Atlantic.”\r\n\r\n“What did they find out?” said Charley Planck.\r\n\r\nSteve shrugged. “I don’t know all the answers. Whatever they are, the\r\nthings can go like hell.”\r\n\r\nI had a hunch he was holding back. I waited until he had finished with\r\nCharley, and then went, down the hall with him. “You think the saucers\r\nare guided missiles?” I said.\r\n\r\n“If I thought so, I wouldn’t be talking,” he said flatly, “That’s not a\r\ndig at you. But I was cleared last year for some secret electronics\r\nwork, and it might be used in some way with guided missiles.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know that, Steve.”\r\n\r\n“It’s O.K.,” he said. “I don’t mind talking, because can’t believe the\r\nsaucers are guided missiles. Maybe few of the things sighted out in the\r\nSouthwest have beer our test rockets, but that doesn’t explain the\r\nradar reports in Canada and Japan.”\r\n\r\n“I’d already heard about a radar case in Labrador,” I told Steve. He\r\nlooked at me quickly.\r\n\r\n“Where’d you pick that up;”\r\n\r\n“_True_ passed it on to me,” I said.\r\n\r\n“They’ve had some trouble tracking the things, they maneuver so fast,”\r\nsaid Steve. “It sounds crazy, but I’ve been told they hit more than ten\r\nthousand miles an hour.”\r\n\r\n“You believe it.?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it’s not impossible. Those saucers were tracked about fifty\r\nmiles up, where there’s not much resistance.”\r\n\r\nThe elevator door opened. Steve waited until we were outside of the\r\nCommerce Building.\r\n\r\n“There’s one other thing that gets me,” he said. “Unless the radar boys\r\nare way off, some of those saucers are enormous. I just can’t see a\r\nguided missile five hundred feet in diameter.” He stopped for a moment.\r\n“I suppose this will sound screwy to you—”\r\n\r\n“You think they’re interplanetary,” I said.\r\n\r\nSteve was quickly on the defensive. “I haven’t bought it yet, but it’s\r\nnot as crazy as it sounds.”\r\n\r\nWithout mentioning names, I told him about the aircraft designer and\r\nthe airline pilots.\r\n\r\n“They’re in good company,” said Steve. “You know the Air Institute?”\r\n\r\n“Sure—the Air Force school down at Montgomery.”\r\n\r\n“Six months ago, I was talking with an officer who’d been instructing\r\nthere.” Steve looked at me, deadly serious. “He told me they are now\r\nteaching that the saucers are probably space ships.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after my meeting with Steve Barrett, I was on a Mainliner\r\n300, starting, a new phase of the saucer investigation. By the time I\r\nreturned, I hoped to know the truth about Project “Saucer.”\r\n\r\nAs the ship droned westward, fourteen thousand feet above the\r\nAlleghenies, I thought of what Steve had told me. I believed, that he\r\nhad told me about the radar tracking. And I was fairly sure he believed\r\nthe Air Institute story. But I wasn’t so certain the story itself was\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be a gag; Steve wasn’t easily taken in. It was more\r\nlikely that one Institute officer, or perhaps several, believed the\r\nsaucers were space craft and aired their personal opinions. The\r\nInstitute wasn’t likely to give an official answer to something that\r\nProject “Saucer” still declared unsolved.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to get an inside look at Project “Saucer”\r\noperations, I could soon tell whether it was an actual investigation or\r\na deliberate cover-up for something else. Whichever it was, the wall of\r\nofficial. secrecy still hid it.\r\n\r\nAs a formality, I had called the Pentagon again and asked to talk with\r\nsome of the Project officers. As I expected, I was turned down. The\r\nonly alternative was to dig out the story by talking with pilots and\r\nothers who had been. quizzed by Project teams. I had several leads, and\r\n_True_ had arranged some interviews for me.\r\n\r\nMy first stop was Chicago, where I met an airline official and two\r\ncommercial pilots. I saw the pilots first. Since they both talked in\r\nconfidence, I will not use their right names. One, a Midwesterner I\r\nalready knew, I’ll call Pete Farrell; the other, a wartime instructor,\r\nArt Green.\r\n\r\nPete was about thirty-one, stocky, blue-eyed, with a pleasant,\r\nintelligent face. Art Green was a little older, a lean, sunburned,\r\nrestless man with an emphatic voice. Pete had served with the Air Force\r\nduring the war; he was now part owner of a flying school, also a pilot\r\nin the Air National Guard. Green was working for an air charter service\r\n\r\nWe met at the Palmer House. Art Green didn’t need much prompting to\r\ntalk about Project “Saucer.” After reporting a disk, seen during a West\r\nCoast Right, he had been thoroughly grilled by a Project “Saucer” team.\r\n\r\n“They practically took me apart,” he said irritably. “They’ve got a lot\r\nof trick questions. Some of ’em are figured out to trip up anybody\r\nfaking a story. The way they worked on me, you’d think I committed a\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n“Then they tried to sell me on the idea I’d seen a balloon, or maybe a\r\nplane, with the sun shining on it when it banked. I told them to go to\r\nthe devil—I knew what I saw. After seventeen years, I’ve got enough\r\nsense to tell a ship or a balloon when I see it.”\r\n\r\n“Did they believe you?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“If they did, they didn’t let on. Two of ’em acted as if they thought I\r\nwas nuts. The other guy-I think he was Air Force Intelligence—acted\r\ndecent. He said not to get steamed up about the Aero-Medical boys; it\r\nwas their job to screen out the crackpots.\r\n\r\n“And on top of that, I found out later the F.B.I. had checked up on me\r\nto find out if I was a liar or a screwball. They went around to my\r\nboss, people in my neighborhood—even the pilots in my outfit. My\r\noutfit’s still razzing me. I wouldn’t report another saucer if one flew\r\nthrough my cockpit.”\r\n\r\nPete Farrell hadn’t encountered any Project “Saucer” teams personally,\r\nbut he had some interesting angles. Some of the information had come\r\nfrom commercial and private pilots in the Midwest, part of it through\r\nNational Guard contacts.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you one thing,” Pete said. “Guard pilots got the same order\r\nas the Air Force. If we saw anything peculiar flying around, we were to\r\ndo our damnedest to identify it.”\r\n\r\n“What about trying to bring one down? I’ve heard that was in one\r\norder.”\r\n\r\nPete hesitated for a second. “Look, I told you that much because it’s\r\nbeen in the papers. But I’m still in the Guard. I can’t tell you the\r\norder itself. It was confidential.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m not in the Guard,” said Art Green. He lit a cigarette, blew\r\nout the match. “Why don’t you look into the Gorman case? Get thc dope\r\non that court-martial angle.”\r\n\r\nI’d heard of the Gorman case, but the court-martial thing was new to\r\nme. Gorman, I recalled, was a fighter pilot in the North Dakota Air\r\nNational Guard. He had a mystifying encounter with a strange,\r\nfast-moving “light” over Fargo Airport in the fall of 1948.\r\n\r\n“That case is on my list,” I told Green. “But I don’t remember anything\r\nabout a court-martial.”\r\n\r\n“It wasn’t in the papers. But all the pilots up that way know about it.\r\nIn his report, Gorman said something about trying to ram the thing. The\r\nidea got around that Air Force orders had said to try this. Anyway, it\r\ngot into the papers and Gorman almost got court-martialed. If his\r\nfamily hadn’t had some influence in the state, the Air Force probably\r\nwould have pushed it.”\r\n\r\n“Are you sure about this?” I said. “You know how those things build\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“Ask Gorman,” he said. “Or ask some of the pilots at Fargo.”\r\n\r\nBefore I left them, Green double-checked my report on his sighting,\r\nwhich Hilton had forwarded. As in the majority of cases, he had seen\r\njust one disk. It had hovered at a very high altitude, gleaming in the\r\nsun, then had suddenly accelerated and raced off to the north.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t tell its size or speed,” said Green. “But if it was as high\r\nas I think, it must have been pretty big.”\r\n\r\nPete told me later that Green believed the disk had been at least\r\ntwenty miles high, because it was well above clouds at thirty thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“It’s kind of hard to believe,” said Pete. “The thing would have to be\r\na lot bigger than a B-twenty-nine, and the speed over two thousand\r\nmiles an hour.”\r\n\r\n“You know what they said about the Mantell saucer,” I reminded him.\r\n“Some of the Godman Field people said it was at least three hundred\r\nfeet in diameter.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard it was twice that,” said Pete.\r\n\r\n“You know any Kentucky National Guard pilots?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“One or two,” said Pete. “But they couldn’t tell me anything. It was\r\nhushed up too fast.”\r\n\r\nThat evening I talked with the airline official, whom I knew well\r\nenough to call by his first name. I put it to him bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Dick, if you’re under orders not to talk, just tell me. Fm trying to\r\nfind out whether Project ‘Saucer’ has muzzled airline pilots.”\r\n\r\n“You mean the ones who’ve sighted things? Perhaps, in a few cases. But\r\nmost of the pilots know what happened to Captain Emil Smith, on United,\r\nand those Eastern pilots. They keep still so they won’t be laughed at.\r\nAlso the airlines don’t like their pilots to talk for publication.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard of several cases,” I said, “where Air Force Intelligence is\r\nsupposed to have warned pilots to keep mum. Two of the reports come\r\npretty straight.”\r\n\r\nHe made a gesture. “That could be. I’m not denying that airline\r\npilots—and that includes ours—see these things all the time. They’ve\r\nbeen sighted on the Seattle-Alaska route, and between Anchorage and\r\nJapan. I know of several saucers that pilots have seen between Honolulu\r\nand the mainland. Check with Pan-American—you’ll find their pilots have\r\nseen them, too.”\r\n\r\n“What happens to those reports?”\r\n\r\n“They go to Operations,” said Dick. “Of course, if something really\r\nimportant happens, the pilot may radio the tower before he lands. Then\r\nthe C.A.A. gets word to the Air Force, and they rush some Intelligence\r\nofficers to quiz the pilots. if it’s not too hot, they’d come from\r\nWright Field—regular Project ‘Saucer’ teams. Otherwise, they’d send the\r\nnearest Intelligence officers to take over temporarily.”\r\n\r\nI asked him if he had ever been in on one of thee sessions. Dick said\r\nhe hadn’t.\r\n\r\n“But a couple of pilots talked to me later. They said these Air Force\r\nmen seemed quite upset about it; they pounced on everything these boys\r\nsaid about the thing’s appearance—how it maneuvered and so on.”\r\n\r\n“What do your pilots think the saucers are?”\r\n\r\nDick gave me a slightly ironic grin. “Why ask me? Captain Blake says\r\nyou’ve been getting it firsthand.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t pulling a fast one,” I protested. “We’re not going to quote\r\nactual names or sources, unless people. O.K. it.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, I know that,” said Dick. “But you’ve got thc answer already.\r\nSome pilots say interplanetary, some say guided missiles. A few—a very\r\nfew—still think it’s all nonsense, because they haven’t seen any.”\r\n\r\n“What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know the answer,” said Dick, “but I’m positive of one thing.\r\nEither the Air Force is sitting on a big secret, or they’re badly\r\nscared because they don’t know the answer.”\r\n\r\nDuring the next week or so, I covered several northwest and mountain\r\nstates. Although I was chiefly trying to find out about Project\r\n“Saucer,” I ran onto two sightings that were not on my list.\r\n\r\nOne of these had occurred in California, at Fairfield Suisan Air Force\r\nBase. A Seattle man who had been stationed there gave me the details.\r\nIt was on the night of December 1918, with unusually high winds\r\nsweeping across the airfield. At times the gusts reached almost seventy\r\nmiles an hour. Suddenly a weird ball of light flashed into view, at a\r\nheight of a thousand feet. As the men on the base watched it,\r\nastonished, the mysterious light abruptly shot skyward. In an\r\nincredibly short time, it reached an altitude of twenty thousand feet\r\nand vanished.\r\n\r\n“Was there any shape outlined behind the light?” I asked the Seattle\r\nman.\r\n\r\n“Nobody saw any,” he replied. “It looked just like I said—a ball of\r\nlight, going like a streak.”\r\n\r\n“Did it leave any smoke behind it?”\r\n\r\n“You mean like an engine, or a jet?” He shook his head. “Not a thing.\r\nAnd it didn’t make a sound—even when it shot up like that.”\r\n\r\n“Did you hear any guesses about it, or reports later on?”\r\n\r\n“Some major who didn’t see it said it must have been a balloon. Anybody\r\nwith brains could see that was screwy. No balloon ever went up that\r\nfast—and besides, the thing was going against the wind.”\r\n\r\nThe second incident occurred at Salmon Dam, Idaho, on August 13, 1947.\r\nWhen I heard the date, it sounded familiar. I checked my sightings file\r\nand saw it was the same day as the strange affair at Twin Falls, Idaho.\r\n\r\nIn the Twin Falls case, the disk was sighted by observers in a canyon.\r\nThere was one interesting difference from the usual description. This\r\ndisk was sky-blue, or else its gleaming surface somehow reflected the\r\nsky because of the angle of vision. Although it was not close to the\r\ntreetops, the observers were amazed to see the trees whip violently\r\nwhen the disk raced overhead, as though the air was boiling from the\r\nobject’s swift passage.\r\n\r\nAt Salmon Dam, that same day, two miners heard an odd roaring sound and\r\nstared into the sky. Several miles away, two brightly gleaming disks\r\nwere circling at high speed.\r\n\r\n“It was like two round mirrors whirling around the sky,” one of the men\r\nwas later quoted as saying. “They couldn’t have been any ordinary\r\nplanes; not round like that. And they were going too fast.”\r\n\r\nDuring this part of my trip, I also was told that one saucer had fallen\r\ninto a mountain lake. This came to me secondhand. The lone witness was\r\nsaid to have rushed over to his car to get his camera as the disk\r\napproached. When it plunged toward the lake, he was so startled that he\r\nfailed to snap the picture until the moment it struck. This story\r\nsounded so flimsy that I didn’t bother to list it.\r\n\r\nMonths later, a Washington newsman confirmed at least part of the lake\r\nstory. When he first related it, I thought he had fallen for a gag.\r\n\r\n“I heard that yarn,” I said. “Don’t tell me you believe it?”\r\n\r\n“I come from Idaho,” he told me. “And I happen to know the fellow who\r\ntook the picture. Maybe it wasn’t a disk, but something fell into that\r\nlake.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see the picture?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, at the Pentagon.” At my surprised look, he added, “That was long\r\nbefore they clamped down. I was talking to an Air Force officer about\r\nthis lake thing, and he showed me the picture.”\r\n\r\n“What did it look like?”\r\n\r\n“You couldn’t tell much about it-just a big splash and a blur where\r\nsomething went under. Maybe a magnifying glass would bring it out, but\r\nI didn’t get a chance to try it.”\r\n\r\nIt was early in 1950 when he told me this. I asked at the Pentagon if\r\nthis picture was in the Wright Field files, and if so whether I could\r\nsee it. My inquiries drew blank looks. No one remembered such a\r\nphotograph. And even if it were in the Project “Saucer” files, I\r\ncouldn’t see it.\r\n\r\nThis was more than two months after Project “Saucer” had been\r\nofficially closed and its secrets presumably all revealed.\r\n\r\nThe rest of my interviews during this 1949 trip helped to round out my\r\npicture of Project “Saucer” operations.\r\n\r\nSome witnesses seemed afraid to talk; a few flatly refused. I found no\r\nproof of official pressure, but I frequently had the feeling that\r\nstrong hints had been dropped.\r\n\r\nThough one or two witnesses showed resentment at investigators’\r\nmethods, most of them seemed more annoyed at the loss of time involved.\r\nOne man had been checked first by the police, then by the sheriff’s\r\noffice; an Air Force team had spent hours questioning him, returning\r\nthe next day, and finally the F.B.I. had made a character check. What\r\nhe told me about the Air Force interrogation confirmed one of Art\r\nGreen’s statements.\r\n\r\n“One Intelligence captain tried to tell me I’d seen a weather balloon.\r\nI called up the airport and had them check on release schedules. They\r\nsaid next day it didn’t fit any schedules around this area. Anyway, the\r\nwind wasn’t right, because the thing I saw was cutting into the wind at\r\na forty-five-degree angle.”\r\n\r\nOther witnesses told me that investigators had suggested birds,\r\nmeteors, reflections on clouds, shooting stars, and starshells as\r\nprobable explanations of what they had seen. I learned of one pilot who\r\nhad been startled by seeing a group of disks racing past his plane. Air\r\nForce investigators later suggested that he had flown through a flock\r\nof birds, or perhaps a cluster of balloons.\r\n\r\nOn the flight back to Washington, I reread all the information the Air\r\nForce had released on Project “Saucer.” Suddenly a familiar phrase\r\ncaught my eye. I read over the paragraph again:\r\n\r\n“Preliminary study of the more than 240 domestic and thirty foreign\r\nincidents by Astro-Physicist Hynek indicates that an over-all total of\r\nabout 30% can probably be explained away as astronomical phenomena.”\r\n\r\n_Explained away_.\r\n\r\nI went through the report line by line. On page 17 I found this:\r\n\r\n“Available preliminary reports now indicate that a great number of\r\nsightings can be explained away as ordinary occurrences which have been\r\nmisrepresented as a result of human errors.”\r\n\r\nOn page 22 I ran onto another use of the phrase:\r\n\r\n“The obvious explanation for most of the spherical-shaped objects\r\nreported, as already mentioned, is that they are meteorological or\r\nsimilar type balloons. This, however, does not explain reports that\r\nthey travel at high speed or maneuver rapidly. But ‘Saucer’ men point\r\nout that the movement could be explained away as an optical illusion or\r\nactual acceleration of the balloon caused by a gas leak and later\r\nexaggerated by observers. . . . There are scores of possible\r\nexplanations for the scores of different type sightings reported.”\r\n\r\nExplained away . . . It might not mean anything. It could be just an\r\nunfortunate choice of words. But suppose that the real mission of\r\nProject “Saucer” was to cover up something. Or that its purpose was to\r\ninvestigate something serious, at the same time covering it up, step by\r\nstep. The Project “Saucer” teams, then, would check on reports and\r\nsimultaneously try to divert attention from the truth, suggesting\r\nvarious answers to explain the sightings. Back at Wright Field,\r\nanalysts and Intelligence officers would go over the general picture\r\nand try to work up plausible explanations, which, if necessary, could\r\neven be published.\r\n\r\n“Explaining away” would be one of the main purposes of Project\r\npersonnel. These words would probably be used in discussions of ways\r\nand means; they would undoubtedly would be used in secret official\r\npapers. And since this published preliminary report had been made up\r\nfrom censored secret files, the use of those familiar words might have\r\nbeen overlooked, since, read casually, they would appear harmless. If\r\nthe report had been thrown together hastily, the use of these telltale\r\nwords could be easily understood, and so could the report’s strange\r\ncontradictions.\r\n\r\nAs an experiment, I fixed the idea firmly in mind that Project “Saucer”\r\nwas a cover-up unit. Then I went back once more and read the items\r\nquoted above. The effect was almost startling.\r\n\r\nIt was as though I were reading confidential suggestions for diverting\r\nattention and explaining away the sightings; suggestions made by\r\nProject members and probably circulated for comment.\r\n\r\n“Now, wait a minute,” I said to myself. “You may be dreaming up this\r\nwhole thing.”\r\n\r\nTrying to get back to a neutral viewpoint, I skimmed through the other\r\ndetails of Project operations, as described in the report.\r\n\r\nThe order creating Project “Saucer” was signed on December 30, 1947.\r\n(The actual code name was not “Saucer,” but since for some reason the\r\nAir Force still has not published the name, I have followed their usage\r\nof “Saucer” in its place.)\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 1948, two weeks after Captain Mantell’s death, the\r\nproject officially began operations. (Preliminary investigation at\r\nGodman Field had been done by local Intelligence officers.) Project\r\n“Saucer” was set up under the Air Materiel Command at Wright Field.\r\n\r\nContracts were made with an astrophysicist (Professor Joseph Hynek),\r\nalso a prominent scientist (still unidentified), and a group of\r\nevaluation experts (Rand Corporation). Arrangements were made for\r\nservices by the Air Weather Service, Andrews Field; the U. S. Weather\r\nBureau; the Electronics Laboratory, Cambridge Field Station; the A.M.C.\r\nAero-Medical Laboratory; the Army and Navy Departments; the F.B.I.; the\r\nDepartment of Commerce, Civil Aeronautics Administration; and various\r\nother government and private agencies. In addition, the services of\r\nrocket experts, guided-missile authorities, space-travel planners, and\r\nothers (in the defense services or assigned to them) were made\r\navailable as desired. Under the heading “How Incidents Are\r\nInvestigated,” the Project “Saucer” report says:\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the hoaxes and crank letters in reality play a small part in\r\nProject “Saucer.”\r\n\r\nActually, it is a serious, scientific business of constant\r\ninvestigation, analysis and evaluation which thus far has yielded\r\nevidence pointing to the conclusion that much of the saucer scare is no\r\nscare at all, but can be attributed to astronomical phenomena, to\r\nconventional aerial objects, to hallucinations and to mass psychology.\r\n\r\nBut the mere existence of some yet unidentified flying objects\r\nnecessitates a constant vigilance on the part of Project “Saucer”\r\npersonnel and the civilian population. Investigation is greatly stepped\r\nup when observers report incidents as soon as possible to the nearest\r\nmilitary installation or to Headquarters, A.M.C., direct.\r\n\r\nA standard questionnaire is filled out under the guidance of\r\ninterrogators. In each case, time, location, size and shape of object,\r\napproximate altitude, speed, maneuvers, color, length of time in sight,\r\nsound, etc., are carefully noted. This information is sent in its\r\nentirety, together with any fragments, soil photographs, drawings,\r\netc., to Headquarters, A.M.C. Here, highly trained evaluation teams\r\ntake over. The information is broken down and filed on summary sheets,\r\nplotted on maps and graphs and integrated with the rest of the\r\nmaterial, giving an easily comprehended over-all picture.\r\n\r\nDuplicate copies on each incident arc sent to other investigating\r\nagencies, including technical labs within the Air Materiel Command.\r\nThese are studied in relation to many factors such as guided missile\r\nresearch activity, weather, and many others, atmospheric sounding\r\nballoon launchings, commercial and military aircraft flights, flights\r\nof migratory birds and a myriad of other considerations which might\r\nfurnish explanations.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the flying objects are divided into four groups: Flying\r\ndisks, torpedo or cigar-shaped bodies with no wings or fins visible in\r\nflight, spherical or balloon-shaped objects and balls of light. The\r\nfirst three groups are capable of flight by aerodynamic or aerostatic\r\nmeans and can be propelled and controlled by methods known to\r\naeronautical engineers. As for the lights, their actions—unless they\r\nwere suspended from a higher object or were the product of\r\nhallucination—remain unexplained.\r\n\r\nEventually, reports are sent back to Project “Saucer” headquarters,\r\noften marking incidents closed. The project, however, is a young\r\none-much of its investigation is still under way.\r\n\r\nCurrently, a psychological analysis is being made by A.M.C.’s\r\nAero-Medical laboratory to determine what percentage of incidents are\r\nprobably based on errors of the human mind and senses. Available\r\npreliminary reports now indicate that a great number can be explained\r\naway as ordinary occurrences which have been misrepresented as a result\r\nof these human errors.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the end of the last page, a paragraph summed tip the report.\r\n\r\n“The ‘Saucers’ are not a joke. Neither are they cause for alarm to the\r\npopulation. Many of the incidents already have answers. Meteors.\r\nBalloons. Falling stars. Birds in flight. Testing devices, etc. Some of\r\nthem still end in question marks.”\r\n\r\nFrom what I had learned on this trip, I strongly doubted the answer\r\nsuggested. All but the “testing devices.” What did they mean by that?\r\nIt could be a hint at guided missiles; they had already mentioned\r\nguided-missile research activity in another spot.\r\n\r\nBut if _that_ was what lay behind this elaborate project, they would\r\nhardly be hinting at it. If the answer was space travel, then such\r\nhints made sense, They would be part of the cover-up plan.\r\nEveryone—including the Soviet Union—knew we were working on guided\r\nmissiles. It would do no harm to use this as one of the “myriad\r\nexplanations” for the flying saucers.\r\n\r\nI was still trying to figure it out when my plane let down for the\r\nlanding at Washington. I had hoped by this time to know the truth about\r\nProject “Saucer.” Instead, it was a deeper mystery than ever.\r\n\r\nTrue, I had found out how they operated—outside of Wright Field. Some\r\nof the incidents had been enlightening. By now, I was certain that\r\nProject “Saucer” was trying hard to explain away the sightings and hide\r\nthe real answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, I found a brief letter from Ken Purdy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Don:\r\n\r\nThe Mantell and Eastern cases both look good. I don’t see how they can\r\nbrush them off. It looks more like the interplanetary answer to me, but\r\nwe won’t decide on treatment until we’re sure. [I had suggested two or\r\nthree angles, if this proved the real answer.]\r\n\r\nWho would be the best authority to check our disk operation theory and\r\ngive us more details on directional control? I’d like to have it\r\nchecked by two more engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEN\r\n\r\n\r\nNext day, I dug out my copy of Boal’s interview with D———, the famous\r\naircraft designer.\r\n\r\n“Certainly the flying saucers are possible,” the designer had told\r\nBoal. “Give me enough money and I’ll build you one. It might have to be\r\na model because the fuel would be a problem. If the saucers that have\r\nbeen seen came from other worlds, which isn’t at all Buck Rogerish,\r\nthey may be powered with atomic energy or by the energy that produces\r\ncosmic rays—which is many times more powerful—or by some other fuel or\r\nnatural force that our research hasn’t yet discovered. But the circular\r\nairfoil is quite feasible.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t have the stability of the conventional airplane, but it\r\nwould have enormous maneuverability—it could rise vertically, hover,\r\ndescend vertically, and fly at extremely high speed, with the proper\r\npower. Don’t take my word for it. Check with other engineers.”\r\n\r\nBefore looking up a private engineer I had in mind, I went to the\r\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The N.A.C.A. is America’s\r\nmost authoritative source of aerodynamic knowledge. I knew they had\r\nalready tried out disk-shaped airfoils, and I asked about this first. I\r\nfound that two official N.A.C.A. reports, Technical Note 539 and Report\r\n431, discuss tests on circular and elliptical Clark Y airfoils. Both\r\nreports state that these designs were found practical.\r\n\r\nLater, I talked with one of the top engineers in the N.A.C.A. Without\r\nshowing him D———’s sketch, I asked how a disk might operate.\r\n\r\n“It could be built with variable-direction jet or rocket nozzles,” be\r\nsaid. “The nozzles would be placed around the rim, and by changing\r\ntheir direction the disk could be made to rise and descend vertically.\r\nIt could hover, fly straight ahead, and make sharp turns.\r\n\r\n“Its direction and velocity would be governed by the number of nozzles\r\noperating, the power applied, and the angle at which they were tilted.\r\nThey could be pointed toward the ground, rearward, in a lateral\r\ndirection, or in various combinations.\r\n\r\n“A disk flying level, straight ahead, could be turned swiftly to right\r\nor left by shifting the angles of the nozzles or cutting off power from\r\npart of the group. This method of control would operate in the earth’s\r\natmosphere and also, using rocket power, in free space, where\r\nconventional controls would be useless.”\r\n\r\nThe method he had described was not the one which D——— had outlined.\r\n\r\n“What about a rotating disk?” I asked the N.A.C.A. man. “Suppose you\r\nhad one with a stationary center, and a large circular section rotating\r\naround it? The rotating part would have a camber built into it, or it\r\nwould have slotted vanes.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me a curious look, “Where’d you get that idea about the\r\ncamber?”\r\n\r\nI told him it had come to me from _True_.\r\n\r\n“It could be done,” he said. “The slotted-vanes method has already been\r\ntried. There’s an engineer in Glendale, California, who’s built a\r\nmodel. His name’s E. W. Kay.”\r\n\r\nHe gave me a few details on how a cambered or slotted-vane rotating\r\ndisk might operate, then interrupted himself to ask me what I thought\r\nthe saucers were.\r\n\r\n“They’re either interplanetary or some secret development,” I said.\r\n‘What do you think?”\r\n\r\n“The N.A.C.A. has no proof they even exist,” he answered.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the building a few minutes later, I was still weighing that\r\nstatement. If the Air Force or the Navy had a secret disk device, the\r\nN.A.C.A. would almost certainly know about it. The chances were that\r\nany disk-shaped missile or new type of circular aircraft would first\r\nhave been tested in the N.A.C.A. wind tunnels at Langley Field. If the\r\nsaucers were interplanetary, the N.A.C.A.—at least top officials—would\r\nprobably have been in on any discussion of the disks’ performance.\r\nEither way, the N.A.C.A.’s official attitude could be expected to match\r\nthe Pentagon’s.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, I took a taxi to the office of the private engineer. Like\r\nD———, he has asked that he not be quoted by name. The name I am using,\r\nPaul Redell, will serve that purpose. Redell is a well-known\r\naeronautical engineer. He has worked with major aircraft companies and\r\nserved as a special consultant to government agencies and the\r\nindustries. He is also a competent pilot.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had known him several years, he refused at first to talk\r\nabout the saucers. Then I realized he thought I meant to quote him. I\r\nshowed him some of the material I had roughed out, in which names were\r\nomitted or changed as requested.\r\n\r\n“All right,” Redell said finally. “What do you want to know?”\r\n\r\n“Anything you can tell us. But first, your ideas on these sketches.” I\r\nshowed him D———’s drawings and then gave him the high points of the\r\ninvestigation. When I mentioned the mystery-light incident at Fairfield\r\nSuisan Air Force Base, Redell sat up quickly.\r\n\r\n“The Gorman case again!”\r\n\r\n“We heard about some other ‘light’ cases,” I said. “One was at Las\r\nVegas.”\r\n\r\n“I know about that one. That is, it you mean the green light—wait a\r\nminute!” Redell frowned into space for a few seconds, “You say that\r\nFairfield Suisan sighting was on December third? Then the Las Vegas\r\nsighting was only a few days later. It was the first week of the month,\r\nI’m positive.”\r\n\r\n“Those light reports have got me stumped,” I said. “A light just can’t\r\nfly around by itself. And those two-foot disks—”\r\n\r\n“You haven’t worked on the Gorman case?” asked Redell.\r\n\r\nI told him I hadn’t thought it was coming up on my schedule.\r\n\r\n“Leave these sketches here,” he said. “Look into that Gorman sighting.\r\nThen check on our plans for space exploration. I’ll give you some\r\nsources. When you get through, come on back and we’ll talk it over.”\r\n\r\nThe Gorman “saucer dogfight” had been described in newspapers; the\r\npilot had reported chasing a swiftly maneuvering white light, which had\r\nfinally escaped him. Judging from the Project “Saucer” preliminary\r\nreport, this case had baffled all the Air Force investigators. When I\r\nmet George Gorman, I found him to be intelligent, coolheaded, and very\r\nfirmly convinced of every detail in his story. I had learned something\r\nabout his background. He had had college training. During the war, he\r\nhad been an Air Force instructor, training French student pilots. In\r\nFargo, his home, he had a good reputation, not only for veracity but as\r\na businessman. Only twenty-six, he was part owner of a construction\r\ncompany, and also the Fargo representative for a hardware-store chain.\r\nEven knowing all this, I found it hard at first to believe some of the\r\ndogfight details. But the ground observers confirmed them.\r\n\r\nIt was about nine o’clock in the evening, October 1, 1948. Gorman, now\r\nan Air National Guard lieutenant, had been on a practice flight in an\r\nF-51 fighter. The other pilots on this practice patrol had already\r\nlanded. Gorman had just been cleared by the C.A.A. operator in the\r\nFargo Airport tower when he saw a fast-moving light below his circling\r\nfighter.\r\n\r\nFrom his altitude, 4,500 feet, it appeared to be the tail light of a\r\nswiftly flying plane. As nearly as he could tell, it was 1,000 feet\r\nhigh, moving at about 250 m.p.h. Gorman called the tower to recheck his\r\nclearance. He was told the only other plane in the area was a Piper\r\nCub. Gorman Could see the Cub plainly outlined below him. There was a\r\nnight football game going on, and the field was brightly lighted. But\r\nthe Cub was nowhere near the strange light.\r\n\r\nAs the mystery light raced above the football field. Gorman noticed an\r\nodd phenomenon. Instead of seeing the silhouette of a plane, he saw no\r\nshape at all around the light. By contrast, he could see the Cub’s\r\noutline clearly.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the airport traffic controller, L. D. Jensen, had also\r\nspotted the queer light. Concerned with the danger of collision—he said\r\nlater that he, too, thought it a plane’s tail light—he trained his\r\nbinoculars on it. Like Gorman, he was unable to distinguish a shape\r\nnear the light. Neither could another C.A.A. man who was with him in\r\nthe tower, a Fargo resident named Manuel E. Johnson.\r\n\r\nUp in the F-51, Gorman dived on the light, which was steadily blinking\r\non and off.\r\n\r\n“As I closed in,” he told Project “Saucer” men later, “it suddenly\r\nbecame steady and pulled up into a sharp left turn. It was a clear\r\nwhite and completely roundabout six to eight inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was making a pass at the tower. I dived after it and\r\nbrought my manifold pressure up to sixty, but I couldn’t catch the\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\nGorman reported his speed at full power as 350 to 400 miles per hour.\r\nDuring the maneuvers that followed, both the C.A.A. men watched from\r\nthe tower. Jensen was using powerful night glasses, but still no shape\r\nwas visible near the mysterious light. The fantastic dogfight continued\r\nfor twenty minutes. Gorman described it in detail.\r\n\r\n“When I attempted to turn with the light, I blacked out temporarily,\r\nowing to excessive speed. I am in fairly good physical condition, and I\r\ndon’t believe there are many, if any, pilots who could withstand the\r\nturn and speed effected by the light and remain conscious.”\r\n\r\nDuring these sharp maneuvers, the light climbed quickly, then made\r\nanother left bank.\r\n\r\n“I put my fifty-one into a sharp turn and tried to cut it off,” said\r\nGorman. “By then we were at about seven thousand feet, Suddenly it made\r\na sharp right turn and we headed straight at each other. Just when we\r\nwere about to collide I guess I lost my nerve. I went into a dive and\r\nthe light passed over my canopy at about five hundred feet. Then it\r\nmade a left circle about one thousand feet above and I gave chase\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nWhen collision seemed imminent a second time, the object shot straight\r\ninto the air. Gorman climbed after it at full throttle.\r\n\r\nJust about this time, two. other witnesses, a private pilot and his\r\npassenger, saw the fast-moving light. The pilot was Dr. A. D. Cannon,\r\nan oculist; his passenger was Einar Nelson. Dr. Cannon later told\r\ninvestigators the light was moving at high speed. He thought it might\r\nbe a Canadian jet fighter from over the border. (A careful check with\r\nCanadian air officials ruled out this answer.) After landing at the\r\nairport, Dr. Cannon and Mr. Nelson again watched the light, saw it\r\nchange direction and disappear.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Gorman was making desperate efforts to catch the thing. He\r\nwas now determined to ram it, since there seemed nothing solid behind\r\nit to cause a dangerous crash. If his fighter was disabled, or if it\r\ncaught fire, he could bail out.\r\n\r\nBut despite the F-51’s fast climb, the light still outdistanced him. At\r\n14,000 feet, Gorman’s plane went into a power stall, He made one last\r\ntry, climbing up to 17,000 feet. A few moments later, the light turned\r\nin a north-northwest direction and quickly disappeared.\r\n\r\nThroughout the dogfight, Gorman noticed no deviation on his\r\ninstruments, according to the Project “Saucer” report. Gorman did not\r\nconfirm or deny this when I talked with him. But he did agree with the\r\nrest of the Project statement. He did not notice any sound, odor, or\r\nexhaust trail.\r\n\r\nGorman’s remarks about ramming the light reminded me of what Art Green\r\nhad said. When I asked Gorman about the court-martial rumor, he gave me\r\na searching glance.\r\n\r\n“Where did you hear that?”\r\n\r\n“Several places,” I told him. “At Chicago, in Salt Lake City—in fact,\r\nwe’ve been hearing it all over.”\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s nothing to it,” Gorman declared. He changed the subject.\r\n\r\nSome time afterward, a Fargo pilot told me there had been trouble over\r\nthe ramming story.\r\n\r\n“But it wasn’t Gorman’s fault. Somebody else released that report to\r\nthe A. P. The news story didn’t actually say there was an Air Force\r\norder to ram it, but the idea got around, and we heard that Washington\r\nsquawked. Gorman had a pretty rough time of it for a while. Some of the\r\nnewspapers razzed his story. And the Project ‘Saucer’ teams really\r\nworked on him. I guess they were trying to scare him into saying he was\r\nmistaken, and it was a balloon.”\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Gorman about this, he denied he’d had rough treatment by\r\nthe Project teams.\r\n\r\n“Sure, they asked about a thousand questions, and I could tell they\r\nthought it might be a hoax at first. But that was before they quizzed\r\nthe others who saw it.”\r\n\r\n“Anybody suggest it was a balloon?” I said casually.\r\n\r\n“At first, they were sure that’s what it was,” answered Gorman. “You\r\nsee, there was a weather balloon released here. You know the kind, it\r\nhas a lighted candle on it. The Project teams said I’d chased after\r\nthat candle and just imagined the light’s maneuvers—confused it with my\r\nown movement, because of the dark.”\r\n\r\nGorman grinned. “They had it just about wrapped up—until they talked to\r\nGeorge Sanderson. He’s the weather observer. He was tracking the\r\nballoon with a theodolite, and he showed them his records. The time and\r\naltitudes didn’t fit, and the wind direction was wrong. The balloon was\r\ndrifting in the opposite direction. Both the tower men backed him up.\r\nSo that killed the weather-balloon idea.”\r\n\r\nThe next step by Project “Saucer” investigators had been to look for\r\nsome unidentified aircraft. This failed, too. Obviously, it was only\r\nroutine; the outline of a conventional plane would certainly have been\r\nseen by Gorman and the men in the tower.\r\n\r\nAn astronomical check by Professor Hynek ruled out stars, fireballs,\r\nand comets—a vain hope, to begin with. The only other conventional\r\nanswer, as the Project report later stated, was hallucination. In view\r\nof all the testimony, hallucination had to he ruled out. Finally, the\r\ninvestigators admitted they had no solution.\r\n\r\nThe first Project “Saucer” report, on April 27, 1949, left the Gorman\r\n“mystery light” unidentified.\r\n\r\nIn the _Saturday Evening Post_ of May 7, 1949, Sidney Shallett analyzed\r\nthe Gorman case, in the second of his articles on flying saucers.\r\nShallet suggested this solution: that Gorman had chased one of the\r\nNavy’s giant cosmic-ray research balloons. Each of these huge balloons\r\nis lighted, so that night-flying planes will not collide with the gas\r\nbag or the instrument case suspended below. Shallett concluded that\r\nGorman was suffering from a combination of vertigo and confusion with\r\nthe light on the balloon.\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, these huge Navy balloons are filled with only a\r\nsmall amount of helium before their release at Minneapolis. They then\r\nrise swiftly to very high altitudes, unless a leak develops. In\r\nShallett’s words, “These balloons travel high and fast. . . .”\r\n\r\nFargo is about two hundred miles from Minneapolis. Normally, a\r\ncosmic-ray research balloon would have reached a very high altitude by\r\nthe time it had drifted this far. The only possible answer to its\r\nlow-altitude sighting would be a serious leak.\r\n\r\nIf a leaking balloon had come down to one thousand feet at Fargo, it\r\nwould either have remained at that height or kept on descending. The\r\nmystery light was observed at this altitude moving at high speed. If a\r\nCub’s outline was visible against the lighted football field, the\r\nmassive shape of even a partly deflated balloon would have stood out\r\nlike an elephant. Even before release, the partially inflated gas bags\r\nare almost a hundred feet tall. The crowd at the football game would\r\ncertainly have seen such a monstrous shape above the glare of the\r\nfloodlights, for the plastic balloons gleam brightly in any light rays.\r\nThe two C.A.A. men, watching with binoculars, could not possibly have\r\nmissed it.\r\n\r\nFor the cosmic-balloon answer to be correct, this leaking gas bag would\r\nhave had to rise swiftly to seventeen thousand feet—after a loss of\r\nhelium had forced it down to one thousand. As a balloon pilot, I know\r\nthis is impossible. The Project “Saucer” report said unequivocally:\r\n“The object could outturn and outspeed the F-51, and was able to attain\r\na much steeper climb and to maintain a constant rate of climb far in\r\nexcess of the Air Force fighter.”\r\n\r\nA leaking balloon? More and more, I became convinced that Secretary\r\nForrestal had persuaded some editors that it was their patriotic duty\r\nto conceal the answer, whatever it was.\r\n\r\nThat thought had begun to worry me, because of my part in this\r\ninvestigation. Perhaps John Steele had been right, and we shouldn’t be\r\ntrying to dig out the answer. But I had already told Purdy, and he had\r\nagreed, that if national security was involved, we would drop the thing\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had proved the balloon answer wrong, I was badly puzzled.\r\nThe idea of a disembodied light was the hardest thing to swallow that\r\nI’d come across so far.\r\n\r\nAnd yet there were the other light reports—the strange sighting at\r\nFairfield Suisan Field, the weird green lights at Las Vegas and\r\nAlbuquerque. And there was the encounter that Lieutenant H. G. Combs\r\nhad had one night above Andrews Field, near Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nThis incident had occurred on November 18, 1948, six weeks after\r\nGorman’s experience. Combs, flying with another lieutenant named\r\nJackson, was about to land his T-6, at 9:45 P.M., when a strange object\r\nloomed up near him. It looked like a grayish globe, and it gave off an\r\nodd, fuzzy light.\r\n\r\nCombs chased the weird object for over ten minutes, during which it\r\nappeared to evade every move he made. Once, its speed was nearly six\r\nhundred miles an hour, as closely as he could estimate. In a final\r\nattempt to identify it, Combs zoomed the T-6 up at a steep angle and\r\nflashed his landing lights on it. Before he could get a good look, the\r\nglobe light whirled off to the east and vanished.\r\n\r\nSince Combs’s story had been in the newspapers, Project “Saucer”\r\nevidently had felt in wise to give some explanation. When I read it, in\r\nthe preliminary report, I was amazed. Here was the concluding sentence:\r\n\r\n“The mystery was cleared up when the object was identified positively\r\nas a cluster of cosmic-ray research balloons.”\r\n\r\nEven one of the giant balloons would have been hard to take as the\r\nexplanation. Combs was almost sure to have collided with it in his\r\nhead-on passes. But an entire cluster! I tried to picture the T-6\r\nzooming and twisting through the night sky, with several huge balloons\r\nin its path. It would be a miracle if Combs got through without hitting\r\none of them, even if each balloon was lighted. But he had seen only one\r\nlight; so had Lieutenant Jackson. That would mean all the rest of the\r\nballoons were unlighted—an unbelievable coincidence.\r\n\r\nIt was not until months afterward that I found Project “Saucer” had\r\nwithdrawn this “solution.” In its final report, this case, Number 207,\r\nwas listed in the “Unidentified” group. How the balloon-cluster\r\nexplanation ever got into the first report is still a mystery.\r\n\r\nWhen I talked with Gorman, I told him I was baffled by the idea of a\r\nlight maneuvering through the skies with no airfoil to support it.\r\n\r\n“I know,” he said. “It got me, too, at first.”\r\n\r\n“You mean you know the answer?” I demanded.\r\n\r\n“It’s just my personal opinion,” said Gorman. “But I’d rather not have\r\nit printed. You see, I got some ideas from all the questions those\r\nProject teams asked me. If my hunch turns out to be right, I might be\r\ntalking about an official secret.”\r\n\r\nI tried to pry some hint out of him, but Gorman just smiled and shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you this much,” he said, “because it’s been mentioned in\r\nprint. There was _thought_ behind every move the light made. It wasn’t\r\nany radar-responder gadget making it veer away from my ship.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?”\r\n\r\n“Because it reacted differently at different times. If it had been a\r\nmechanical control, it would have turned or climbed the same way each\r\ntime I got near it. Instead, it was as if some intelligent mind was\r\ndirecting every turn like a game of chess, and always one move ahead of\r\nme. Maybe you can figure out the rest.”\r\n\r\nThat was all I could get out of him. It bothered me, because Combs’s\r\nreport indicated the same thing. I had a strong temptation to skip the\r\nspace-plans research and tell Redell what Gorman had told me. But\r\nRedell had an orderly mind, and he didn’t like to be pushed.\r\n\r\nReluctantly, I gave up the idea. I had a feeling Redell knew the answer\r\nto the mystery lights, and it wasn’t easy to put off the solution.\r\n\r\nThe letter that came from Art Green, while I was working on the space\r\nplans, didn’t make it easier:\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Keyhoe:\r\n\r\nJust heard about your Seattle visit. That Fairfield Suisan thing is on\r\nthe level; several Air Force pilots have told me about it.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to Fargo, ask Gorman what they found when they checked his\r\nship with a Geiger counter. If he says it was negative, then he must be\r\nunder orders. I happen to know better.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours,\r\nART GREEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first step, in checking on our space plans, was to look up official\r\nannouncements. I found that on December 29, 1948, Defense Secretary\r\nJames Forrestal had released this official statement:\r\n\r\n“The Earth Satellite Vehicle Program, which is being carried out\r\nindependently by each military service, has been assigned to the\r\nCommittee on Guided Missiles for co-ordination.\r\n\r\n“To provide an integrated program, the Committee has recommended that\r\ncurrent efforts be limited to studies and component design.\r\nWell-defined areas of such research have been allocated to each of the\r\nthree military departments.”\r\n\r\nAppropriation bills had already provided funds for space exploration\r\nplans. The Air Force research was indicated by General Curtis E. LeMay,\r\nwho was then Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Research and Development. In\r\noutlining plans for an Air Engineering Design Center at Wright Field,\r\nGeneral LeMay included these space-exploration requisites:\r\n\r\n“Flight and survival equipment for ultra-atmospheric operations,\r\nincluding space vehicles, space bases, and devices for use therein.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of exploring space is, of course, nothing new. For many years,\r\nwriters of imaginative fiction have described trips to the moon and\r\ndistant planets. More recently, comic books and strips have gone in\r\nheavily for space-travel adventures.\r\n\r\nAs a natural result of this, the first serious rocket experiments in\r\nthis country were labeled screwball stunts, about on a par with efforts\r\nto break through the sonic barrier. The latter had been “proved”\r\nimpossible by aeronautical engineers; as for rocket flight, it was too\r\nsilly for serious consideration. Pendray, Goddard, and other rocket\r\npioneers took some vicious ridicule before America woke up to the\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nMeantime, German scientists had gone far ahead. Their buzz bomb, a\r\nlow-altitude semi-guided missile, was just the beginning. Even the\r\ndevastating V-2, which soared high into the stratosphere before falling\r\non England, was just a step in their tremendous space program. If the\r\nNazis could have hung on a year or two more, the war might have had a\r\ngrimly different ending.\r\n\r\nWhen the Allies seized Nazi secrets, some of the German plans were\r\nrevealed. Among them was one for a huge earth satellite. From this\r\nbase, which would circle the earth some five hundred miles away,\r\nenormous mirrors would focus the sun’s rays on any desired spot. The\r\nresult: swift, fiery destruction of any city or base refusing to\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nFirst publication of this scheme brought the usual jeers. Many people,\r\nincluding some reputable scientists, believed it had been just a\r\npropaganda plan that even Goebbels had discarded as hopeless.\r\n\r\nThen the Pentagon announced the U.S. Earth Satellite Vehicle Program,\r\nalong with plans for a moon rocket, The artificial satellite is to be a\r\nlarge rocket-propelled projectile. In its upward flight, it will have\r\nto reach a speed of 23,000 miles an hour, to escape the earth’s pull of\r\ngravity. At a height of about 500 miles, special controls will turn the\r\nprojectile and cause it to circle the earth. These controls will be\r\neither automatic or operated from the ground, by radar. Theoretically,\r\nonce such a vehicle is beyond gravity’s magnetism, it can coast along\r\nin the sky forever. Its rocket power will be shut off; the only need\r\nfor such power would be if the satellite veered off course. A momentary\r\nburst from the jets would be sufficient to bring it back to its orbit.\r\n\r\nCircling the earth in about two hours, this first satellite is expected\r\nto be used as a testing station. Instruments will record and transmit\r\nvital information to the earth—the effect of cosmic rays, solar\r\nradiation, fuel required for course corrections, and many other items.\r\n\r\nA second space base farther out will probably be the next step. It may\r\nbe manned, or it may be under remote control like the first. Perhaps\r\nthe first satellite vehicle will be followed by a compartmented\r\noperating base, a sort of aerial aircraft carrier, with other rocket\r\nships operating to and fro on the earth shuttle. The moon rocket is\r\nexpected to add to our information about space, so that finally we will\r\nemerge with an interplanetary space craft.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts may fail. The first satellite may fall back and have\r\nto be guided to an ocean landing. Or its controls might not bring it\r\ninto the planned orbit. In this case, it could coast on out into space\r\nand be lost. But sooner or later, effective controls will be found.\r\nThen the manned space ships will follow.\r\n\r\nOnce in free space, there will be no gravitational pull to offset. The\r\nspace ship and everything in it will be weightless. Shielding is\r\nexpected to prevent danger from cosmic rays and solar radiation.\r\n\r\nThe danger from meteorites has been partly discounted in one scientific\r\nstudy. (“Probability that a meteorite will hit or penetrate a body\r\nsituated in the vicinity of the earth,” by G. Grimminger, _Journal of\r\nApplied Physics_, Vol. 19, No. 10, pp. 947-956, October 1948) In this\r\nstudy, it is stated that a meteorite is unlikely to penetrate the thick\r\nshell our space vehicles will undoubtedly have. However, this applies\r\nonly to the earth’s atmosphere. Longer studies, using remote-controlled\r\nvehicles in space, may take years before it will be safe to launch a\r\nmanned space ship. Radar or other devices may have to be developed to\r\ndetect approaching meteorites at a distance and automatically change a\r\nspace ship’s course. The change required would be infinitesimal, using\r\npower for only a fraction of a second.\r\n\r\nBut before we are ready for interplanetary travel, we will have to\r\nharness atomic power or some other force not now available, such as\r\ncosmic rays. Navigation at such tremendous speeds is another great\r\nproblem, on which special groups are now at work. A Navy scientific\r\nproject recently found that strange radio signals are constantly being\r\nsent out from a “hot spot” in the Milky Way; other nebulae or “hot”\r\nstars may be similarly identified by some peculiarity in their radio\r\nemanations. If so, these could be used as check points in long-range\r\nspace travel.\r\n\r\nEscape from the earth’s gravity is possible even now, according to\r\nFrancis H. Clauser, an authority on space travel plans. But the cost\r\nwould be prohibitive, with our present rocket motors, and practical\r\noperations must wait for higher velocity rocket power, atomic or\r\notherwise. (“Flight beyond the Earth’s Atmosphere, “_S.A.E. Quarterly\r\nTransactions_, Vol. 2, No, 4, October 1948.)\r\n\r\nAlready, a two-stage rocket has gone more than 250 miles above the\r\nearth. This is the V-2-Wac Corporal combination. The V-2 rocket is used\r\nto power the first part of the flight, dropping off when its fuel is\r\nexhausted. The Wac Corporal then proceeds on its own fuel, reaching a\r\nfantastic speed in the thin air higher up.\r\n\r\nHundreds of technical problems must be licked before the first\r\nsatellite vehicle can be launched successfully. Records on our V-2\r\nrockets indicate some of the obstacles. On the take-off, their present\r\nswift acceleration would undoubtedly kill anyone inside. When\r\nre-entering the earth’s atmosphere the nose of a V-2 gets red-hot.\r\n\r\nBoth the acceleration and deceleration must be controlled before the\r\nfirst volunteers will be allowed to hazard their lives in manned\r\nrockets. Willi Ley, noted authority on space-travel problems, believes\r\nthat pilots may have to accept temporary blackout as a necessity on the\r\ntake-off. (Two of his books, _Rockets and Space Travel_ and _Outer\r\nSpace_, give fascinating and well-thought-out pictures of what we may\r\nexpect in years to come.)\r\n\r\nSome authorities believe that our space travel will be confined to our\r\nown solar system for a long time, perhaps forever. The trip to the\r\nmoon, though now a tremendous project, would be relatively simple\r\ncompared with a journey outside our system. Escape from the moon, for\r\nthe return trip, would be easier than leaving the earth; because of its\r\nsmaller mass, to escape the moon’s gravitational pull would take a\r\nspeed of about 5,000 miles an hour, against 23,000 for the earth.\r\nNavigation would be much simpler. Our globe would loom up in the\r\nheavens, much larger and brighter than the moon appears to us. Radar\r\nbeams would also be a guide.\r\n\r\nThe greatest obstacle to reaching far-distant planet is the time\r\nrequired. In the Project “Saucer” study of space travel, Wolf 359 was\r\nnamed as the nearest star likely to have possibly inhabited areas. Wolf\r\n359 is eight light-years from the earth. The limiting speed in space,\r\naccording to Einstein’s law, would be just under the speed of\r\nlight—186,000 miles per second. At this speed, Einstein states, matter\r\nis converted into energy. It is a ridiculous assumption, but even if\r\natomic power, or some force such as cosmic rays, made an approach to\r\nthat speed possible, it would still take eight years to reach Wolf 359.\r\nThe round trip would take sixteen.\r\n\r\nThere have been a few scientists who dispute Einstein’s law, though no\r\none has disproved it. If the speed of light is not an absolute limit\r\nfor space ships, then travel to remote parts of the universe may\r\nsomeday be possible.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a trip outside our solar system could be a lifetime\r\nexpedition. Most space travel would probably be limited to the planets\r\nof our sun—the moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, and the others.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may be many years before the first manned space ship leaves\r\nthe earth, we are already at work on the problems the crews would face.\r\nI learned some of the details from a Navy flight surgeon with whom I\r\nhad talked about take-off problems.\r\n\r\n“They’re a lot further than that” he told me. “Down at Randolph Field,\r\nthe Aero-Medical research lab has run into some mighty queer things.\r\nEver hear of ‘dead distance’?”\r\n\r\n“No, that’s a new one.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it sounds crazy, but they’ve figured out that a space ship would\r\nbe going faster than anyone could think.”\r\n\r\n“But you think instantaneously,” I objected.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. It takes a fraction of a second, even for the fastest thinker.\r\nLet’s say the ship was making a hundred miles a second—and that’s slow\r\ncompared with what they expect eventually. Everything would happen\r\nfaster than your nerve impulses could register it. Your comprehension\r\nwould always be lagging a split second behind the space ship’s\r\noperation.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why that’s so serious,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Suppose radar or some other device warned you a meteorite was coming\r\ntoward you head-on. Or maybe some instrument indicated an error in\r\nnavigation. By the time your mind registered the thought, the situation\r\nwould have changed.”\r\n\r\n“Then all the controls would have to be automatic,” I said. I told him\r\nthat I had heard about plans for avoiding meteorites. “Electronic\r\ncontrols would be faster than thought.”\r\n\r\n“That’s probably the answer,” he agreed. “Of course, at a hundred miles\r\na second it might not be too serious. But if they ever get up to speeds\r\nlike a thousand miles a second, that mental lag could make an enormous\r\ndifference, whether it was a meteorite heading toward you or a matter\r\nof navigation.”\r\n\r\nOne of the problems he mentioned was the lack of gravity. I had already\r\nlearned about this. Once away from the earth’s pull, objects in the\r\nspace ship would have no weight. The slightest push could send crewmen\r\nfloating around the sealed compartment.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you spilled a cup of coffee,” said the flight surgeon. “What\r\nwould happen?”\r\n\r\nI said I hadn’t thought it out.\r\n\r\n“The Randolph Field lab can tell you,” he said. “The coffee would stay\r\nright there in the air. So would the cup, if you let go of it. But\r\nthere’s a more serious angle—your breath.”\r\n\r\n“You’d have artificial air,” I began.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they’ve already worked that out. But what about the breath you\r\nexhale? It contains carbon dioxide, and if you let it stay right there\r\nin front of your face you’d be sucking it back into your lungs. After a\r\nwhile, it would asphyxiate you. So the air has to be kept in motion,\r\nand besides that the ventilating system has to remove the carbon\r\ndioxide.”\r\n\r\n“What about eating?” I asked. “Swallowing is partly gravity, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\nHe nodded. “Same as drinking, though the throat muscles help force the\r\nfood down. I don’t know the answer to that. In fact, everything about\r\nthe human body presents a problem. Take the blood circulation. The\r\namount of energy required to pump blood through the veins would be\r\nalmost negligible. What would that do to your heart?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t even guess,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s all the Aero-Medical lab can do—guess at it. They’ve been\r\ntrying to work out some way of duplicating the effect of zero gravity,\r\nbut there’s just no answer. If you could build a machine to neutralize\r\ngravity, you could get all the answers, except to the ‘dead distance’\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“For instance, there’s the matter of whether the human body would even\r\nfunction without gravity. All down through the stages of evolution,\r\nman’s organs have been used to that downward pull. Take away gravity,\r\nand your whole body might stop working. Some of the Aero-Medical men\r\nI’ve talked with don’t believe that, but they admit that long trips\r\noutside of gravity might have odd effects.\r\n\r\n“Then there’s the question of orientation. Here on earth, orienting\r\nyourself depends on the feeling you get from the pull of gravity, plus\r\nyour vision. just being blindfolded is enough to disorient some people.\r\nTaking away the pull of gravity might be a lot worse. And of course out\r\nin space your only reference points would be distant stars and planets.\r\nWe’ve been used to locating stars from points on the earth, where we\r\nknow their position. But how about locating them from out in space,\r\nwith a ship moving at great speed? Inside the space ship, it would be\r\nsomething like being in a submarine. Probably only the pilot\r\ncompartment would have glass ports, and those would be covered except\r\nin landing—maybe even then. Outside vision might be by television, so\r\nyou couldn’t break a glass port and let out your pressure.\r\n\r\n“But to go back to the submarine idea. It would be like a sub, with\r\nthis big difference: In the submarine you can generally tell which way\r\nis down, except maybe in a crash dive when you may lose your\r\nequilibrium for a moment. But in the space ship, you could be standing\r\nwith your feet on one spot, and another crewman might be—relative to\r\nyou—standing upside down. You might be floating horizontally, the other\r\nman vertically. The more you think about it, the crazier it gets. But\r\nthey’ve got to solve all those problems before we can tackle space.”\r\n\r\nTo make sure I had the details right, I checked on the Air Force\r\nresearch. I found that the Randolph Field laboratory is working on all\r\nthese problems, and many more.\r\n\r\nAlthough plans arc not far enough advanced to make it certain, probably\r\nanimals will be sent up in research rockets to determine the effect of\r\nno gravity before any human beings make such flights. The results could\r\nbe televised back to the earth.\r\n\r\nAll through my check-up on space exploration plans, one thing struck\r\nme: I met no resistance. There was no official reticence about the\r\nprogram; on the contrary, nothing about it seemed secret.\r\n\r\nEven though it was peacetime, this was a little curious, because of the\r\npotential war value of an earth satellite vehicle. Even if the Nazi\r\nscheme for destruction proved just a dream, an orbiting space base\r\ncould be used for other purposes. In its two-hour swing around the\r\nearth, practically all of the globe could be observed-directly, by\r\npowerful telescopes, or indirectly, by a combination of radar and\r\ntelevision. Long-range missiles could be guided to targets, after being\r\nlaunched from some point on the earth. As the missiles climbed high\r\ninto the stratosphere, the satellite’s radar could pick them up and\r\nkeep them on course by remote control.\r\n\r\nThere were other possibilities for both attack and defense. Ordinarily,\r\nprojects with wartime value are kept under wraps, or at least not\r\nwidely publicized. Of course, the explanation might be very simple: The\r\ncompletion of the satellite vehicle was so remote that there seemed no\r\nneed for secrecy. But in that case, why had the program been announced\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nIf the purpose had been propaganda, it looked like a weak gesture. The\r\nSoviets would not be greatly worried by a dream weapon forty or fifty\r\nyears off. Besides that, the Pentagon, as a rule, doesn’t go for such\r\npropaganda. There was only one conventional answer that made any sense.\r\nIf we had heard that the Soviets were about to announce such a program,\r\nas a propaganda trick, it would be smart to beat them to it. But I had\r\nno proof of, any such Russian intention.\r\n\r\nThe date on Secretary Forrestal’s co-ordination announcement was\r\nDecember 30, 1948. One day later, the order creating Project “Saucer”\r\nhad been signed. That didn’t prove anything; winding up the year,\r\nForrestal could have signed a hundred orders. I was getting too\r\nsuspicious.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I had now analyzed the Gorman case and checked on our\r\nspace plans. Tomorrow I would see Redell and find out what he knew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I called Redell’s office I found he had flown to Dallas and would\r\nnot be back for two days. By the time he returned, I had written a\r\ndraft of the Gorman case, with my answer to the balloon explanation.\r\nWhen I saw him, the next morning, I asked him to look it over.\r\n\r\nRedell lighted his pipe and then read the draft, nodding to himself now\r\nand then.\r\n\r\n“I think that’s correct analysis,” he said when he finished. “That was\r\na very curious case. You know, Project ‘Saucer’ even had psychiatrists\r\nout there. If Gorman had been the only witness, I think they’d have\r\ncalled it a hallucination. As it was, they took a crack at him and the\r\nC.A.A. men in their preliminary report.”\r\n\r\nThough I recalled that there had been a comment, I didn’t remember the\r\nwording. Redell looked it up and read it aloud:\r\n\r\n“‘From a psychological aspect, the Gorman incident raised the question,\r\n“Is it possible for an object without appreciable shape or known\r\naeronautical configuration to appear to travel at variable speeds and\r\nmaneuver intelligently?”’”\r\n\r\n“Hallucination might sound like a logical answer,” I said, “until you\r\ncheck all the testimony. But there are just too many witnesses who\r\nconfirm Gorman’s report. Also, he seems like a pretty level-headed\r\nchap.”\r\n\r\nRedell filled his pipe again. “But you still can’t quite accept it?”\r\n\r\n“I’m positive they saw the light—but what the devil was it? How could\r\nit fly without some kind of airfoil?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe it didn’t. You remember Gorman described an odd fuzziness around\r\nthe edge of the light? It’s in this Air Force report. That could have\r\nbeen a reflection from the airfoil.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but Gorman would have seen any solid—” I stopped, as Redell made\r\na negative gesture.\r\n\r\n“It could be solid and still not show up,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You mean it was transparent? Sure, that would do it!”\r\n\r\n“Let’s say the airfoil was a rotating plastic disk, absolutely\r\ntransparent. The blurred, fuzzy look could have been caused by the\r\nwhirling disk. Neither Gorman nor the C.A.A. men in the tower could\r\npossibly see the disk itself.”\r\n\r\n“Paul, I think you’ve hit it,” I said. “I can see thc rest of it—the\r\nthing was under remote control, radio or radar. And from the way it\r\nflew rings around Gorman, whoever controlled it must have been able to\r\nsee the F-51, either with a television ‘eye’ or by radar,”\r\n\r\n“Or by some means we don’t understand,” said Redell. He went on\r\ncarefully, “In all these saucer cases, keep this in mind: We may be\r\ndealing with some totally unknown principle—something completely beyond\r\nour comprehension.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment, I thought he was hunting at some radical discovery by\r\nSoviet—captured Nazi scientists. Then I realized what he meant.\r\n\r\n“You think they’re interplanetary,” I murmured.\r\n\r\n“Why not?” Redell looked surprised. “Isn’t that your idea? I got that\r\nimpression.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I didn’t think you believed it. When you said to check on our\r\nspace plans, I thought you had some secret missile in mind.”\r\n\r\n“No, I had another reason. I wanted you to see all the problems\r\ninvolved in space travel. If you accept the interplanetary answer, you\r\nhave to accept this, too—whoever is looking us over has licked all\r\nthose problems years ago. Technically, they’d be hundreds of years\r\nahead of us—maybe thousands. It has a lot to do with what they’d be up\r\nto here.”\r\n\r\nWhen I mentioned the old sighting reports, I found that Redell already\r\nknew about them. He was convinced that the earth had been under\r\nobservation a long time, probably even before the first recorded\r\nsightings.\r\n\r\n“I know some of those reports aren’t authentic,” he admitted. “But if\r\nyou accept even one report of a flying disk or rocket-shaped object\r\nbefore the twentieth century, then you have to accept the basic idea.\r\nIn the last forty years, you might blame the reports on planes and\r\ndirigibles. But there was no propelled aircraft until 1903. Either all\r\nthose early sightings were wrong, or some kind of fast aerial machine\r\nhas been flying periodically over the earth for at least two centuries.\r\n\r\nI told him I was pretty well convinced, but that _True_ faced a\r\nproblem. There was some conflicting evidence, and part of it seemed\r\nlinked with guided missiles. I felt sure we could prove the\r\nspace-travel answer, but we had to stay clear of discussing any weapons\r\nthat were still a secret.\r\n\r\n“I can’t believe that guided missiles are the answer to the Godman\r\nField saucer and the Chiles-Whitted case, or this business at Fargo.\r\nBut we’re got to be absolutely sure before we print anything.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let’s analyze it,” said Redell. “Let’s see if all the saucers\r\ncould be explained as something launched from the earth.”\r\n\r\nHe reached for a pad and a pencil.\r\n\r\n“First, let’s take your rotating disk. That would be a lot simpler to\r\nbuild than the stationary disk with variable jet nozzles. With a disk\r\nrotated at high speed you get a tremendous lift, whether it’s slotted\r\nor cambered, as long as there’s enough air to work on.”\r\n\r\n“The helicopter principle,” I said.\r\n\r\nRedell nodded. “The most practical propulsion would be with two or more\r\njets out on the rim, to spin your rotating section. But to get up\r\nenough speed for the jets to be efficient, you’d have to whirl the disk\r\nmechanically before the take-off. Here’s one way. You could have a\r\nsquare hole in the center; then the disk launching device would have a\r\nsquare shaft, rotated by an engine or a motor. As the speed built up,\r\nthe cambered disk would ride up the shaft and free itself, rising\r\nvertically, with the jets taking over the job of whirling the cambered\r\nsection.\r\n\r\n“The lift would be terrific, far more than any normal aircraft. I don’t\r\nbelieve any human being could take the G’s involved in a maximum power\r\nclimb; they’d have to use remote control. When it got to the desired\r\naltitude, your disk could be flown in any direction by tilting it that\r\nway. The forward component from that tremendous lift would result in a\r\nvery high speed. The disk could also hover, and descend vertically.”\r\n\r\n“What about maneuvering?” I asked, thinking of Gorman’s experience.\r\n\r\n“It could turn faster than any pilot could stand,” said Redell. “Of\r\ncourse, a pilot’s cockpit could be built into a large disk; but there’d\r\nhave to be some way of holding down the speed, to avoid too many G’s in\r\ntight maneuvers.”\r\n\r\n“Most of the disks don’t make any noise,” I said. “At least, that’s the\r\ngeneral report. You’d hear ordinary jets for miles.”\r\n\r\n“Right, and here’s another angle. Ram jets take a lot of fuel. Even\r\nwith some highly efficient new jet, I can’t see the long ranges\r\nreported. Some of these saucers have been seen all over the world. No\r\nmatter which hemisphere they were launched from, they’d need an\r\neight-thousand-mile range, at least, to explain all of the sightings.\r\nThe only apparent answer would be some new kind of power, probably\r\natomic. We certainly didn’t have atomic engines for aircraft in 1947,\r\nwhen the first disks were seen here. And we don’t have them now, though\r\nwe’re working on it. Even if we had such an engine, it wouldn’t be tiny\r\nenough to power the small disks.”\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” I said, “we’d hardly be flying them all over everywhere. The\r\ncost would be enormous, and there’d always be a danger of somebody\r\ngetting the secret if a disk landed.”\r\n\r\n“Plus the risk of injuring people by radiation. just imagine an\r\natomic-powered disk dropping into a city. The whole idea’s ridiculous.”\r\n\r\n“That seems to rule out the guided-missile answer,” I began. But Redell\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n“Disk-shaped missiles are quite feasible. I’m talking about range,\r\nspeed, and performance. Imagine for a moment that we have disk-type\r\nmissiles using the latest jet or rocket propulsion—either piloted or\r\nremote-controlled. The question is, could such disks fit specific\r\nsightings like the one at Godman Field and the case at Fargo?”\r\n\r\nRedell paused as if some new thought had struck him.\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, here’s an even better test. I happen to know about this\r\ncase personally. Marvin Miles—he’s an aviation writer in Los\r\nAngeles—was down at White Sands Proving Ground some time ago. He talked\r\nwith a Navy rocket expert who was in charge of naval guided-missile\r\nprojects. This Navy man—he’s a commander in the regular service—told\r\nMiles they’d seen four saucers down in that area.”\r\n\r\n“You’re sure he wasn’t kidding Miles?” I said. Then I remembered\r\nPurdy’s tip about a White Sands case.\r\n\r\n“I told you I checked on this myself,” Redell said, a little annoyed.\r\n“After Miles told me about it, I asked an engineer who’d been down\r\nthere if it was true. He gave me the same story, figures and all. The\r\nfirst saucer was tracked by White Sands observers with a theodolite.\r\nThen they worked out its performance with ballistics formulas.”\r\n\r\nRedell looked at me grimly.\r\n\r\n“The thing was about fifty miles up. And it was making over fifteen\r\nthousand miles an hour!”\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses, said Redell, was a well-known scientist from the\r\nGeneral Mills aeronautical research laboratory in Minneapolis, which\r\nwas working with the Navy. (A few days later, I verified this fact and\r\nthe basic details of Redell’s account. But it was not until early in\r\nJanuary 1950 that I finally identified the officer as Commander Robert\r\nB. McLaughlin and got his dramatic story.)\r\n\r\n“Here are two more items Miles told me,” Redell went on. “This Navy\r\nexpert said the saucer actually looked elliptical, or egg-shaped. And\r\nwhile it was being tracked it suddenly made a steep climb—so steep no\r\nhuman being could have lived through it.”\r\n\r\n“One thing is certain,” I said. “That fifty-mile altitude knocks out\r\nthe rotating disk. Up in that thin air it wouldn’t have any lift.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said Redell. “And the variable jet type would require an\r\nenormous amount of fuel. Regardless, those G’s mean it couldn’t have\r\nhad any pilot born on this earth.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Marvin Miles, this White Sands saucer had been over a\r\nhundred feet long. (Later, Commander McLaughlin stated that it was 105\r\nfeet.) If this were an American device, then it meant that we had\r\nalready licked many of the problems on which the Earth Satellite\r\nVehicle designers were supposed to be just starting. Their statements,\r\nthen, would have to be false—part of an elaborate cover-up.\r\n\r\n“If we had such an advanced design,” said Redell, “and I just don’t\r\nbelieve it possible—would we gamble on a remote-control system? No such\r\nsystem is perfect. Suppose it went wrong. At that speed, over fifteen\r\nthousand miles an hour, your precious missile or strato ship could be\r\nhalfway around the globe in about forty-five minutes. That is, if the\r\nfuel held out. Before you could regain control, you might lose it in\r\nthe sea. Or it might come down behind the Iron Curtain. Even if it were\r\nI smashed to bits, it would tip off the Soviets. They might claim it\r\nwas a guided-missile attack. Almost anything could hap pen.”\r\n\r\n“It could have a time bomb in it,” I suggested. “if it got off course\r\nor out of control, it would blow itself up.”\r\n\r\nRedell emphatically shook his head. “I’ve heard that idea before, but\r\nit won’t hold up. What if your ship’s controls went haywire and the\r\nthing blew up over a crowded city? Imagine the panic, even if no actual\r\ndamage was done. No, sir—nobody in his right mind is going to let a\r\nhuge ship like that go barging around unpiloted. It would be criminal\r\nnegligence.\r\n\r\n“If the White Sands calculations were correct, then this particular\r\nsaucer was no earth-made device. Perhaps in coming years, we could\r\nproduce such a ship, with atomic power to drive it. But not now.”\r\n\r\nRedell went over several other cases.\r\n\r\n“Take the Godman Field saucer. At one time, it was seen at places one\r\nhundred and seventy-five miles apart, as you know. Even to have been\r\nseen at all from both places, it would. have to have been huge—much\r\nlarger than two hundred and fifty feet in diameter. The human eye\r\nwouldn’t resolve an object that size, at such a distance and height.”\r\n\r\nIt was an odd thing; I had, gone over the Mantell case a dozen times. I\r\nknew the object was huge. But I had never tried to figure out the\r\nobject’s exact size.\r\n\r\n“How big do you think it was?” I asked quickly. This could be the key I\r\nhad tried to find.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t worked it out,” said Redell. “But I can give you a rough\r\nidea. The human eye can’t resolve any object that subtends less than\r\nthree minutes of arc. For instance, a plane with a hundred-foot wing\r\nspan would only be a speck twenty miles away, if you saw it at all.”\r\n\r\n“But this thing was seen clearly eighty-seven miles away—or even more,\r\nif it wasn’t midway between the two cities. Why, it would have to be a\r\nthousand feet in diameter.”\r\n\r\n“Even larger.” Redell was silent a moment. “What was the word Mantell\r\nused—‘tremendous’?” I tried to visualize the thing, but my mind balked.\r\nOne thing was certain now. It was utterly impossible that any nation on\r\nearth could have built such an enormous airborne machine. just to think\r\nof the force required to hold it in the sky was enough to stagger any\r\nengineer. We were years away—perhaps centuries—from any such\r\npossibility.\r\n\r\nAs if he had read my thoughts, Redell said soberly, “There’s no other\r\npossible answer. It was a huge space ship—perhaps the largest ever to\r\ncome into our atmosphere.”\r\n\r\nIt was clear now why such desperate efforts had been made to explain\r\naway the object Mantell had chased.\r\n\r\n“What about that Eastern Airlines sighting?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, first,” said Redell, “it wasn’t any remote-control guided\r\nmissile. I’ll say it again; it would be sheer insanity. Suppose that\r\nthing had crashed in Macon. At that speed it could have plowed its way\r\nfor blocks, right through the buildings. It could have killed hundreds\r\nof people, burned the heart out of the city.\r\n\r\n“If it was a missile, or some hush-hush experimental job, then it was\r\npiloted. But they don’t test a job like that on any commercial airways.\r\nAnd they don’t fool around at five thousand feet where people will see\r\nthe thing streaking by and call the newspapers.\r\n\r\n“To power a hundred-foot wingless ship, especially at those speeds,\r\nwould take enormous force. Not as much as a V-two rocket, but\r\ntremendous power. The fuel load would be terrific. Certainly, the pilot\r\nwouldn’t be circling around Georgia and Alabama for an hour, buzzing\r\nairliners. I’ll stake everything that we couldn’t duplicate that space\r\nship’s performance for less than fifty million dollars. It would take\r\nsomething brand-new in jets.”\r\n\r\nRedell paused. He looked at me grimly. “And the way I’d have to soup it\r\nup, it would be a damned dangerous ship to fly. No pilot would\r\ndeliberately fly it that low. He’d stay up where he’d have a chance to\r\nbail out.”\r\n\r\nI told him what I had heard about the blueprints the Air Force was said\r\nto have rushed.\r\n\r\n“Of course they were worried,” said Redell. “And probably they still\r\nare. But I don’t think they need be; so far, there’s been nothing\r\nmenacing about these space ships.”\r\n\r\nWhen I got him back to the Gorman case, Redell drew a sketch on his\r\npad, showing me his idea of the disk light. He estimated the\r\ntransparent rim as not more than five feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n“Possibly smaller,” he said. “You recall that Gorman said the light was\r\nbetween six and eight inches in diameter. He also said it seemed to\r\nhave depth—that was in the Air Force report.”\r\n\r\n“You think all the mechanism was hidden by the light?”\r\n\r\n“Only possible answer,” said Redell. “But just try to imagine crowding\r\na motor, or jet controls for rim jets, along with remote controls and a\r\ntelevision device, in that small space. Plus your fuel supply. I don’t\r\nknow any engineer who would even attempt it. To carry that much gear,\r\nit would take a fair-sized plane. You could make a disk large enough,\r\nbut the mechanism and fuel section would be two or three feet across,\r\nat least. So Gorman’s light must have been powered and controlled by\r\nsome unique means. The same principle applies to all the other light\r\nreports I’ve heard. No shape behind them, high speed, and intelligent\r\nmaneuvers. That thing was guided from some interplanetary ship,\r\nhovering at a high altitude,” Redell declared. “But I haven’t any idea\r\nwhat source of power it used.”\r\n\r\nUntil then, I had forgotten about Art Green’s letter. I told Redell\r\nwhat Art had said about the Geiger counter.\r\n\r\n“I knew they went over Gorman’s fighter with a Geiger counter,” Redell\r\ncommented. “But they said the reaction was negative. If Green is right,\r\nit’s interesting. It would mean they have built incredibly small atomic\r\nengines. But with a race so many years ahead of us, it shouldn’t be\r\nsurprising. Of course, they may also be using some other kind of power\r\nour scientists say is impossible.”\r\n\r\nI was about to ask him what he meant when his secretary came in.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Carson is waiting,” she told Redell. “He had a four-o’clock\r\nappointment.”\r\n\r\nAs I started to leave, Redell looked at his calendar.\r\n\r\n“I hate to break this up; it’s a fascinating business What about coming\r\nin Friday? I’d like to see the rest of those case reports.”\r\n\r\n“Fine,” I said. “I’ve got a few more questions, too.”\r\n\r\nGoing out, I made a mental note of the Friday date. Then the figure\r\nclicked; it was just three months since I’d started on this assignment.\r\n\r\nThree months ago. At that time I’d only been half sure that the saucers\r\nwere real. If anyone had said I’d soon believe they were space ships,\r\nI’d have told him he was crazy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore my date with Redell, I went over all the material I had, hoping\r\nto find some clue to the space visitors’ planet. It was possible, of\r\ncourse, that there was more than one planet involved.\r\n\r\nProject “Saucer” had discussed the possibilities in it! report of April\r\n27, 1949. I read over this section again:\r\n\r\n\r\nSince flying saucers first hit the headlines almost two years ago,\r\nthere has been wide speculation that the aerial phenomena might\r\nactually be some form of penetration from another planet.\r\n\r\nActually, astronomers are largely in agreement that only one member of\r\nthe solar system beside Earth is capable of supporting life. That is\r\nMars. Even Mars, however, appears to be relatively desolate and\r\ninhospitable, so that a Martian race would be more occupied with\r\nsurvival than we are on Earth.\r\n\r\nOn Mars, there exists an excessively slow loss of atmosphere, oxygen\r\nand water, against which intelligent beings, if they do exist there,\r\nmay have protected themselves by scientific control of physical\r\nconditions. This might have been done, scientists speculate, by the\r\nconstruction of homes and cities underground where the atmospheric\r\npressure would be greater and thus temperature extremes reduced. The\r\nother possibilities exist, of course, that evolution may have developed\r\na being who can withstand the rigors of the Martian climate, or that\r\nthe race—if it ever did exist—has perished.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the existence of intelligent life on Mars, where the\r\nrare atmosphere is nearly devoid of oxygen and water and where the\r\nnights are much colder than our Arctic winters, is not impossible but\r\nis completely unproven.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of intelligent life also existing on the planet Venus\r\nis not considered completely unreasonable by astronomers. The\r\natmosphere of Venus apparently consists mostly of carbon dioxide with\r\ndeep clouds of formaldehyde droplets, and there seems to be little or\r\nno water. Yet, scientists concede that living organisms might develop\r\nin chemical environments which are strange to us. Venus, however, has\r\ntwo handicaps. Her mass and gravity are nearly as large as the Earth\r\n(Mars is smaller) and her cloudy atmosphere would discourage astronomy,\r\nhence space travel.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last argument, I thought, did not have too much weight. We were\r\nplanning to escape the earth’s gravity; Martians could do the same,\r\nwith their planet. As for the cloudy atmosphere, they could have\r\ndeveloped some system of radio or radar investigation of the universe.\r\nThe Navy research units, I knew, were probing the far-off Crab nebula\r\nin the Milky Way with special radio devices. This same method, or\r\nsomething far superior, could have been developed on Venus, or other\r\nplanets surrounded by constant clouds.\r\n\r\nAfter the discussion of solar-system planets, the Project “Saucer”\r\nreport went on to other star systems:\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside the solar system other stars—22 in number—have satellite\r\nplanets. Our sun has nine. One of these, the Earth, is ideal for\r\nexistence of intelligent life. On two others there is a possibility of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, astronomers believe reasonable the thesis that there could\r\nbe at least one ideally habitable planet for each of the 22 other\r\neligible stars.\r\n\r\nAfter publication of our findings in _True_, several astronomers said\r\nthat many planets may be inhabited. One of these was Dr. Carl F. von\r\nWeizacker, noted University of Chicago physicist. On January 10, 1950,\r\nDr. von Weizacker stated: “Billions upon billions of stars found in the\r\nheavens may each have their own planets revolving about them. It is\r\npossible that these planets would have plant and animal life on them\r\nsimilar to the earth’s.”\r\n\r\nAfter narrowing the eligible stars down to twenty-two the Project\r\n“Saucer” report goes on:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory is also employed that man represents the average in\r\nadvancement and development. Therefore, one-half the other habitable\r\nplanets would be behind man in development, and the other half ahead.\r\nIt is also assumed that any visiting race could be expected to be far\r\nin advance of man. Thus, the chance of space travelers existing at\r\nplanets attached to neighboring stars is very much greater than the\r\nchance of space-traveling Martians. The one can be viewed as almost a\r\ncertainty (if you accept the thesis that the number of inhabited\r\nplanets is equal to those that are suitable for life and that\r\nintelligent life is not peculiar to the Earth) .”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most likely star was Wolf 359—eight light-years away. I thought for\r\na minute about traveling that vast distance. It was almost appalling,\r\nconsidered in terms of man’s life span. Of course, dwellers on other\r\nplanets might live much longer.\r\n\r\nIf the speed of light was not an absolute limit, almost any space\r\njourney would then be possible. Since there would be no resistance in\r\nouter space, it would be simply a matter of using rocket power in the\r\nfirst stages to accelerate to the maximum speed desired. In the latter\r\nphase, the rocket’s drive would have to be reversed, to decelerate for\r\nthe landing.\r\n\r\nThe night before my appointment with Redell, I was checking a case\r\nreport when the phone rang. It was John Steele.\r\n\r\n“Are you still working on the saucers?” he asked. “If you are, I have a\r\nsuggestion—something that might be a real lead.”\r\n\r\n“I could use a lead right now,” I told him.\r\n\r\n“I can’t give you the source, but it’s one I consider reliable,” said\r\nSteele. “This man says the disks are British developments.”\r\n\r\nThis was a new one. I hadn’t considered the British. Steele talked for\r\nover half an hour, expanding the idea. The saucers, his informant said,\r\nwere rotating disks with cambered surfaces—originally a Nazi device.\r\nNear the end of the war, the British had seized all the models, along\r\nwith the German technicians and scientists who had worked on the\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nThe first British types had been developed secretly in England,\r\naccording to this account. But the first tests showed a dangerous lack\r\nof control; the disks streaked up to high altitudes, hurtling without\r\ndirection. Some had been seen over the Atlantic, some in Turkey, Spain,\r\nand other parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe British then had shifted operations to Australia, where a\r\nguided-missile test range had been set up. (This part, I knew, could be\r\ntrue; there was such a range.) After improving their remote-control\r\nsystem, which used both radio and radar, they had built disks up to a\r\nhundred feet in diameter. These were launched out over the Pacific, the\r\nfirst ones straight eastward over open sea. British destroyers were\r\nstationed at 100-mile and later 500-mile intervals, to track the\r\nmissiles by radar and correct their courses. At a set time, when their\r\nfuel was almost exhausted, the disks came down vertically and landed in\r\nthe ocean. Since part of the device was sealed, the disks would float;\r\nthen a special launching ship would hoist them abroad, refuel them, and\r\nlaunch them back toward a remote base in Australia, where they were\r\nlanded by remote control.\r\n\r\nSince then, Steele said, the disks’ range and speed had been greatly\r\nincreased. The first tests of the new disks was in the spring of 1947,\r\nhis informant had told him. The British had rushed the project, because\r\nof Soviet Russia’s menacing attitude. Their only defense in England,\r\nthe British knew, would be some powerful guided missile that could\r\ndestroy Soviet bases after the first attack.\r\n\r\nIn order to check the range and speeds accurately, it was necessary to\r\nhave observers in the Western Hemisphere—the disks were now traversing\r\nthe Pacific. The ideal test range, the British decided, was one\r\nextending over Canada, where the disks could be tracked and even\r\nlanded.\r\n\r\nIf the account was right, said Steele, a base had been set up in the\r\ndesolate Hudson Bay country. Special radar-tracking stations had also\r\nbeen established, to guide the missiles toward Australia and vessels at\r\nsea. These stations also helped to bring in missiles from Australia.\r\n\r\nSome of the disk missiles were supposed to have been launched from a\r\nBritish island in the South Pacific; others came all the way from\r\nAustralia. Still others were believed to have been launched by a mother\r\nship stationed between the Galapagos Islands and Pitcairn.\r\n\r\nIt was these new disks that had been seen in the United States, Alaska,\r\nCanada, and Latin America, Steele’s informant had told him. At first,\r\nthe sightings were due to imperfect controls; the disks sometimes\r\nfailed to keep their altitude, partly because of conflicting radio and\r\nradar beams from the countries below. Responding to some of these mixed\r\nsignals, Steele said, the disks had been known to reverse course, hover\r\nor descend over radar and radio stations, or circle around at high\r\nspeeds until their own control system picked them up again.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the British had arranged a simple detonator system,\r\noperated either by remote control or automatically under certain\r\nconditions. In this way, no disk would crash over land, with the danger\r\nof hitting a populated area. If it descended below a certain altitude,\r\nthe disk would automatically speed up its rotation, then explode at a\r\nhigh altitude. When radar trackers saw that a disk was off course and\r\ncould not be realigned, the nearest station then sent a special signal\r\nto activate the detonator system. This was always done, Steele had been\r\ntold, when a disk headed toward Siberia; there had previously been a\r\nfew cases when Australian-launched disks had got away from controllers\r\nand appeared over Europe.\r\n\r\nI listened to Steele’s account with mixed astonishment and suspicion.\r\nIt sounded like a pipe dream; but if it was, it had been carefully\r\nthought out, especially the details that followed.\r\n\r\nAt first, Steele said, American defense officials had been completely\r\nbaffled by the disk reports. Then the British, learning about the\r\nsightings, had hastily explained to top-level American officials. An\r\nagreement had been worked out. We were to have the benefit of their\r\nresearch and testing and working models, in return for helping to\r\nconceal the secret. We were also to aid in tracking and controlling the\r\nmissiles when they passed over this country.\r\n\r\n“And I gather we paid in other ways,” Steele said. “My source says this\r\nplayed a big part in increasing our aid to Britain, including certain\r\natomic secrets.”\r\n\r\nThat could make sense. Sharing such a secret would be worth all the\r\nmoney and supplies we had poured into England. If America and Great\r\nBritain both had a superior long-range missile, it would be the biggest\r\nfactor I knew for holding off war. But the long ranges involved in\r\nSteele’s explanation made the thing incredible.\r\n\r\n“How are they powered? What fuel do they use?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“That’s the one thing I couldn’t get,” said Steele. “This man told me\r\nit was the most carefully guarded secret of all. They’ve tapped a new\r\nsource of power.”\r\n\r\n“If he means atomic engines,” I said, “I don’t believe it. I don’t\r\nthink anyone is that far along.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” Steele said earnestly, “he said it wasn’t that. And the rest\r\nof the story hangs together.”\r\n\r\nPrivately, I thought of two or three holes, but I let that go.\r\n\r\n“If it’s British,” I said, “do you think we should even hint at it?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see any harm,” Steele answered. “The Russians undoubtedly know\r\nthe truth. They have agents everywhere. It might do a lot of good for\r\nAmerican-British relations. Anyway, it would offset any fear that the\r\nsaucers are Soviet weapons.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’re not worried about that angle any more?”\r\n\r\nSteele laughed. “No, but it had me going for a while. It was a big\r\nrelief to find out the disks are British.”\r\n\r\n“What’s the disks’ ceiling?” I asked, abruptly.\r\n\r\n“Oh—sixty thousand feet, at least,” said Steele. After a moment he\r\nadded quickly, “That’s just a guess—they probably operate much higher.\r\nI didn’t think to ask.”\r\n\r\nBefore I hung up, he asked me what I thought, of the British\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n“It’s certainly more plausible than the Soviet idea,” I said. I thanked\r\nhim for calling me, and put down the phone. I was tempted to point out\r\nthe flaws in his story. But I didn’t.\r\n\r\nIf he was sincere, it would be poor thanks for what he had told me. If\r\nhe was trying to plant a fake explanation, it wouldn’t hurt to let him\r\nthink I’d swallowed it. When I saw Redell, I told him about Steele.\r\n\r\n“It does look like an attempt to steer you away from the interplanetary\r\nanswer,” Redell agreed, “though he may be passing on a tip he\r\nbelieves.”\r\n\r\n“You think there could be any truth in the British story?”\r\n\r\n“Would the British risk a hundred-foot disk crashing in some American\r\ncity?” said Redell. “No remote control is perfect, and neither is a\r\ndetonator system. By some freak accident, a disk might come down in a\r\nplace like Chicago, and then blow up. I just can’t see the British—any\r\nmore than ourselves—letting huge unpiloted missiles go barging around\r\nthe world, flying along airways and over cities. Certainly, they could\r\nhave automatic devices to make them veer away from airliners—but what\r\nif a circuit failed?”\r\n\r\n“I go along with that,” I said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t say the British don’t have some long-range missiles,” Redell\r\nbroke in. “Every big nation has a guided-missile project. But no guided\r\nmissile on earth can explain the Mantell case and the others we’ve\r\ndiscussed.”\r\n\r\nI showed him the material I had on the Nazi disk experiments. Redell\r\nskimmed through it and nodded.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you a little more,” he said. “Some top Nazi scientists were\r\nconvinced we were being observed by space visitors. They’d searched all\r\nthe old reports. Some sighting over Germany set them off about 1940.\r\nThat’s what I was told. I think that’s where they first got the idea of\r\ntrying out oval and circular airfoils.\r\n\r\n“Up to then, nobody was interested. The rotation idea uses the same\r\nprinciple as the helicopter, but nobody had even followed that through.\r\nThe Nazis went to work on the disks. They also began to rush\r\nspace-exploration plans—the orbiting satellite idea. I think they\r\nrealized these space ships were using some great source of power we\r\nhadn’t discovered on earth. I believe that’s what they were after—that\r\npower secret. If they’d succeeded, they’d have owned the world. As it\r\nwas, that space project caused them to leap ahead of everybody with\r\nrockets.”\r\n\r\nWhen I asked Redell how he thought the space ships were powered, he\r\nshrugged.\r\n\r\n“Probably cosmic rays hold the answer. Their power would be even\r\ngreater than atomic power. There’s another source I’ve heard mentioned,\r\nbut most people scoff at it. That’s the use of electromagnetic fields\r\nin space. The earth has its magnetic field, of course, and so does the\r\nsun. Probably all planets do.\r\n\r\n“There’s a man named Fernand Roussel who wrote a book called _The\r\nUnifying Principle of Physical Phenomena_, about 1943. He goes into the\r\nelectromagnetic-field theory. If he’s right, then there must be some\r\nway to tap this force and go from one planet to another without using\r\nany fuel. You’d use your first planet’s magnetic field to start you off\r\nand then coast through space until you got into the field of the next\r\nplanet. At least, that’s how I understand it. But you’d be safer\r\nsticking to atomic power. That’s been proved.”\r\n\r\nMost of our conversations had been keyed to the technical side of the\r\nflying-saucer problem. But before I left this time, I asked Redell how\r\nthe thought of space visitors affected him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, at first I had a queer feeling about it,” he answered. “But once\r\nyou accept it, it’s like anything else. You get used to the idea.”\r\n\r\n“One thing bothers me,” I said. “When I try to picture them, I keep\r\nremembering the crazy-looking things in some of the comics. What do you\r\nsuppose they’re really like?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve thought about it for months.” Redell slowly shook his head. “I\r\nhaven’t the slightest idea.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening, after my talk with Redell, the question kept coming back\r\nin my mind. What were they like? And what were they doing here?\r\n\r\nFrom the long record of sightings, it was possible to get an answer to\r\nthe second question. Observation of the earth followed a general\r\npattern. According to the reports, Europe, the most populated area, had\r\nbeen more closely observed than the rest of the globe until about 1870.\r\nBy this time, the United States, beginning to rival Europe in\r\nindustrial progress, had evidently become of interest to the space-ship\r\ncrews.\r\n\r\nFrom then on, Europe and the Western Hemisphere, chiefly North America,\r\nshared the observers’ attention. The few sightings reported at other\r\npoints around the world indicate an occasional check-up on the earth in\r\ngeneral. Apparently World War I had not greatly concerned the space\r\nobservers. One reason might be that our aerial operations were still at\r\na relatively low altitude.\r\n\r\nBut World War II had drawn more attention, and this had obviously\r\nincreased from 1947 up to the present time. Our atomic-bomb explosions\r\nand the V-2 high-altitude experiments might be only coincidence, but I\r\ncould think of no other development that might seriously concern\r\ndwellers on other planets.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange thing to think of some far-off race keeping track of\r\nthe earth’s progress. If Redell was right, it might even have started\r\nin prehistoric time; a brief survey, perhaps once a century or even\r\nfurther spaced, then gradually more frequent observation as cities\r\nappeared on the earth.\r\n\r\nSomewhere on a distant planet there would be records of that long\r\nsurvey. I wondered how our development would appear to that\r\nfar-advanced race. They would have seen the slow sailing ships, the\r\nfirst steamships, the lines of steel tracks that carried our first\r\ntrains.\r\n\r\nWatching for our first aircraft, they would see the drifting balloons\r\nthat seemed an aerial miracle when the Montgolfiers first succeeded.\r\nMore than a century later, they would have noted the slow, clumsy\r\nairplanes of the early 1900’s. From our gradual progress to the big\r\nplanes and bombers of today, they could probably chart our next steps\r\ntoward the stratosphere—and then space.\r\n\r\nDuring the last two centuries, they would have watched a dozen wars,\r\neach one fiercer than the last, spreading over the globe. Adding up all\r\nthe things they had seen, they could draw an accurate picture of man,\r\nthe earth creature, and the increasingly fierce struggle between the\r\nearth races.\r\n\r\nThe long survey held no sign of menace. If there had been a guiding\r\npurpose of attack and destruction, it could have been carried out years\r\nago. It was almost certain that any planet race able to traverse space\r\nwould have the means for attack.\r\n\r\nMore than once, during this investigation, I had been asked: “If the\r\nsaucers are interplanetary, why haven’t they landed here? Why haven’t\r\ntheir crews tried to make contact with us?”\r\n\r\nThere was always the possibility that the planet race or races could\r\nnot survive on earth, or that their communications did not include the\r\nmethods that we used. But I found that hard to believe. Such a superior\r\nrace would certainly be able to master our radio operations, or\r\nanything else that we had developed, in a fairly short time. And it\r\nshould be equally simple to devise some means of survival on earth,\r\njust as we were already planning special suits and helmets for\r\nexistence on the moon. During a talk with a former Intelligence\r\nofficer, I got a key to the probable explanation.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you just reverse it—list what we intend to do when we start\r\nexploring space? That’ll give you the approximate picture of what\r\nvisitors to the earth would be doing.”\r\n\r\nNaturally, all the details of space plans have not been worked out, but\r\nthe general plan is clear. After the first successful earth satellites,\r\nwe will either attempt a space base farther out or else launch a moon\r\nrocket. Probably many round trips to the moon will be made before going\r\nfarther in space. Which planet will be explored first, after the moon?\r\n\r\nAccording to Air Force reports, it is almost a certainty that planets\r\noutside the solar system are inhabited. But because of the vast\r\ndistances involved, expeditions to our neighboring planets may be tried\r\nbefore the more formidable journeys. More than one prominent astronomer\r\nbelieves that life, entirely different from our own, may exist on some\r\nsolar planets. Besides Mars, Jupiter, and Venus, there are five more\r\nthat, like the earth, revolve around the sun.\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent authorities is Dr. H. Spencer Jones, Astronomer\r\nRoyal. In his book _Life on Other Worlds_, Dr. Jones points out that\r\neverything about us is the result of changing processes, begun\r\nmillenniums ago and still going on. We cannot define life solely in our\r\nown terms; it can exist in unfamiliar forms.\r\n\r\n“It is conceivable,” Dr. Jones states in his book, “that we could have\r\nbeings, the cells of whose bodies contained silicon instead of the\r\ncarbon which is an essential constituent of our cells and of all other\r\nliving cells on the earth. And that because of this essential\r\ndifference between the constitution of those cells and the cells of\r\nwhich animal and plant life on the earth are built up, they might be\r\nable to exist at temperatures so high that no terrestrial types of life\r\ncould survive.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Jones, then, life could be possible on worlds hotter\r\nand drier than ours; it could also exist on a very much colder one,\r\nsuch as Mars.\r\n\r\nEven if a survey of the sun’s planets proved fruitless, it would decide\r\nthe question of their being populated. Also, it would provide valuable\r\nexperience for the much longer journeys into space.\r\n\r\nNo one expects such a survey until we have a space vehicle able to make\r\nthe round trip. One-way trips would tell us nothing, even if volunteers\r\noffered to make such suicidal journeys.\r\n\r\nThe most probable step will be to launch a space vehicle equipped with\r\nsupplies for a long time, perhaps a year or two, within the solar\r\nsystem. Since Mars has been frequently mentioned as a source of the\r\nflying saucers, let’s assume it would be the first solar-system planet\r\nto be explored from the earth.\r\n\r\nAs the space ship neared Mars, it could be turned to circle the planet\r\nin an orbit, just like our planned earth satellite vehicle. Once in\r\nthis orbit, it could circle indefinitely without using fuel except to\r\ncorrect its course.\r\n\r\nFrom this space base, unmanned remote-control “observer” units with\r\ntelevision “eyes” or other transmitters would be sent down to survey\r\nthe planet at close range. If it then seemed fairly safe, a manned unit\r\ncould be released to make a more thorough check-up.\r\n\r\nSuch preliminary caution would be imperative. Our explorers would have\r\nno idea of what awaited them. The planet might be uninhabited. It might\r\nbe peopled by a fiercely barbarous race unaware of civilization as we\r\nknow it. Or it might have a civilization far in advance of ours.\r\n\r\nThe explorers would first try to get a general idea of the whole\r\nplanet. Then they would attempt to examine the most densely populated\r\nareas, types of armature, any aircraft likely to attack them. Combing\r\nthe radio spectrum, they would pick up and record sounds and signals in\r\norder to decipher the language.\r\n\r\nAs on earth, they might hear a hodgepodge of tongues. The next step\r\nwould be to select the most technically advanced nation, listen in, and\r\ntry to learn its language, or record it for deciphering afterward on\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOur astronomers already have analyzed Mars’s atmosphere, but the\r\nexplorers would have to confirm their reports, to find out whether the\r\natmosphere at the surface would support their lungs if they landed. The\r\neasiest way would be to send down manned or unmanned units with special\r\napparatus to scoop in atmosphere samples. Later analysis would tell\r\nwhether earthlings would need oxygen-helmet suits such as we plan to\r\nuse on the moon.\r\n\r\nBut before risking flight at such low altitudes, the explorers would\r\nfirst learn everything possible about the planet’s aircraft, if any.\r\nThey would try to determine their top ceiling, maximum speed,\r\nmaneuverability, and if possible their weapons. Mitch of this could be\r\ndone by sending down remote-control “observer” disks, or whatever type\r\nwe decide to use. A manned unit might make a survey at night, or in\r\ndaytime with clouds nearby to shield it. By hovering over the planet’s\r\naircraft bases, the explorers could get most of the picture, and also\r\ndecide whether the bases were suitable for their own use later.\r\n\r\nIt might even be necessary to lure some Martian aircraft into pursuit\r\nof our units, to find out their performance. But our explorers would\r\nabove all avoid any sign of hostility; they would hastily. withdraw to\r\nshow they had no warlike intentions.\r\n\r\nIf the appearance of our observer units and manned craft caused too\r\nviolent reactions on the planet, the explorers would withdraw to their\r\norbiting space vehicle and either wait for a lull or else start the\r\nlong trip back home. Another interplanetary craft from the earth might\r\ntake its place later to resume periodic surveys.\r\n\r\nIn this way, a vast amount of information could be collected without\r\nonce making contact with the strange race. If they seemed belligerent\r\nor uncivilized, we would probably end our survey and check on the next\r\npossibly inhabited planet. If we found they were highly civilized, we\r\nwould undoubtedly attempt later contact. But it might take a long time,\r\ndecades of observation and analysis, before we were ready for that\r\nfinal step.\r\n\r\nWe might find a civilization not quite so advanced as ours. It might\r\nnot yet have developed radio and television. We would then have no way\r\nof getting a detailed picture, learning the languages, or communicating\r\nwith. the Martians. Analysis of their atmosphere might show a great\r\nhazard to earthlings, one making it impossible to land or requiring\r\nyears of research to overcome. There might be other obstacles beyond\r\nour present understanding.\r\n\r\nThis same procedure would apply to the rest of the solar-system planets\r\nand to more distant systems. Since Wolf 359 is the nearest star outside\r\nour system that is likely to have inhabited planets, one of these\r\nplanets would probably be listed as the first to explore in far-distant\r\nspace. It would be a tremendous undertaking, unless the speed of light\r\ncan be exceeded in space. Since Wolf 359 is eight light-years from the\r\nearth, even if a space ship traveled at the theoretical maximum—just\r\nunder 186,00 miles a second—it would take over sixteen years for the\r\nround trip. Detailed observation of the planet would add to this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIf we assume half that speed—which would still be an incredible\r\nattainment with our present knowledge—our space explorers would have to\r\ndedicate at least thirty-two years to the hazardous, lonely round trip.\r\nHowever, there has never been a lack of volunteers for grand\r\nundertakings in the history of man.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that in our survey of the solar-system planets we\r\nwould find some inhabited, but not advanced enough to be of interest to\r\nus. Periodically, we might make return visits to note their progress.\r\nMeantime, our astronomers would watch these planets, probably\r\ndeveloping new, higher powered telescopes for the purpose, to detect\r\nany signs of unusual activity. Any tremendous explosion on a planet\r\nwould immediately concern us.\r\n\r\nSuch an explosion, on Mars, was reported by astronomers on January 16,\r\n1950. The cause and general effects are still being debated. Sadao\r\nSaeki, the Japanese astronomer who first reported it at Osaka, believes\r\nit was of volcanic nature.\r\n\r\nThe explosion created a cloud over an area about seven hundred miles in\r\ndiameter and forty miles high. It was dull gray with a yellowish tinge\r\nand a different color from the atmospheric phenomena customarily seen\r\nnear Mars. Saeki believes the blast might have destroyed any form of\r\nlife existing on the planet, but even though the telescopic camera\r\nrecorded a violent explosion, other authorities do not believe the\r\nplanet was wrecked. The canals first discovered on Mars by Giovanni\r\nSchiaparelli, about 1877, are still apparent on photographs.\r\n\r\nMars is now being carefully watched by astronomers. If there are more\r\nof the strange explosions, the planet will be scanned constantly for\r\nsome clue to their nature. If a mysterious explosion on Mars, or any\r\nother planet, were found of atomic origin, it would cause serious\r\nconcern on earth. Suppose for a moment that it happened many years from\r\nnow, when we will have succeeded in space explorations. At this time,\r\nlet us assume our explorers have found that Mars is experimenting with\r\nhigh-altitude rockets; some of them have been seen, rising at\r\ntremendous speed, in the upper atmosphere of Mars.\r\n\r\nThen comes this violent explosion. A scientific analysis of the cloud\r\nby astrophysicists here on earth proves it was of atomic origin.\r\n\r\nThe first reaction would undoubtedly be an immediate resurvey of Mars.\r\nAs quickly as possible, we would establish an orbiting space base—out\r\nof range of Martian rockets—and try to find how far they had advanced\r\nwith atomic bombs.\r\n\r\nSamples of the Martian atmosphere would be collected and analyzed for\r\ntelltale radiation. Observer units would be flown over the planet, with\r\ninstruments to locate atom-bomb plants and possibly uranium deposits.\r\nThe rocket-launching bases would also come under close observation. We\r\nwould try to learn how close the scientists were to escaping the pull\r\nof gravity. Since Mars’s gravity is much less than the earth’s, the\r\nMartians would not have so far to progress before succeeding in space\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nThe detailed survey by our space-base observers would probably show\r\nthat there was no immediate danger to the earth. It might take one\r\nhundred years—perhaps five hundred—before the Martians could be a\r\nproblem. Eventually, the time would come when Mars would send out\r\nspace-ship explorers. They would undoubtedly discover that the earth\r\nwas populated with a technically advanced civilization. Any warlike\r\nideas they had in mind could be quickly ended by a show of our superior\r\nspace craft and our own atomic weapons—probably far superior to any on\r\nMars. It might even be possible that by then we would have finally\r\noutlawed war; if so, a promise to share the peaceful benefits of our\r\ntechnical knowledge might be enough to bring Martian leaders into line.\r\n\r\nRegardless of our final decision, we would certainly keep a lose watch\r\non Mars—or any other planet that seemed a possible threat.\r\n\r\nNow, if our space-exploration program is just reversed, it will give a\r\nreasonable picture of how visitors from space might go about\r\ninvestigating the earth. Such an investigation would tie in with the\r\ngeneral pattern of authentic flying-saucer reports:\r\n\r\n1. World-wide sightings at long intervals up to the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\n2. Concentration on Europe, as the most advanced section of the globe,\r\nuntil late in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n3. Frequent surveys of America in the latter part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as we began to develop industrially, with cities springing up\r\nacross the land.\r\n\r\n4. Periodic surveys of both America and Europe during the gradual\r\ndevelopment of aircraft, from the early 1900’s up to World War II.\r\n\r\n5. An increase of observation during World War II, after German V-2’s\r\nwere launched up into the stratosphere.\r\n\r\n6. A steadily increasing survey after our atomic-bomb explosions in New\r\nMexico, Japan, Bikini, and Eniwetok.\r\n\r\n7. A second spurt of observations following atom-bomb explosions in\r\nSoviet Russia.\r\n\r\n8. Continuing observations of the earth at regular intervals, with most\r\nattention concentrated on the United States, the present leader in\r\natomic weapons. (Saucers have been reported seen over the Soviet Union,\r\nbut the number is unknown. There is some evidence that Russia has an\r\ninvestigative unit similar to Project “Saucer.”)\r\n\r\nThere are other points of similarity to the program of American space\r\nexploration that I have outlined. Most of the extremely large saucers\r\nhave been at high altitudes, some of them many miles above the earth.\r\nAt that height, a space ship would be in no danger from our planes and\r\nantiaircraft guns and rockets. The smaller disks and the mystery lights\r\nhave been seen at low altitudes. Occasionally a larger saucer has been\r\nseen to approach the earth briefly, as at Lockbourne Air Force Base, at\r\nBethel, Alabama, at Macon and Montgomery, and other places. It has been\r\nsuggested that this was for the purpose of securing atmospheric\r\nsamples. It could also be to afford personal observation by the crews.\r\n\r\nThe numerous small disks seen in the first part of the scare, in 1947,\r\nfit the pattern for preliminary and close observation by\r\nremote-controlled observer units. As the scare increased, the daytime\r\nsightings decreased for a while, and mystery lights began to be seen\r\nmore often. This apparent desire to avoid unfavorable attention could\r\nhave been caused by our pilots’ repeated attempts to chase the strange\r\nflying objects.\r\n\r\nAuthentic reports have described sightings; over the following Air\r\nForce bases: Chanute, Newark, Andrews, Hickam, Robbins, Godman, Clark,\r\nFairfield Suisan, Davis-Monthan, Harmon, Wright-Patterson, Holloman,\r\nClinton County Air Force Base, and air bases in Alaska, Germany, and\r\nthe Azores. Saucers have also been sighted over naval air stations at\r\nDallas, Alameda, and Key West, and from the station at Seattle. They\r\nhave been reported maneuvering over the White Sands Proving Ground,\r\nover areas containing atomic developments, above the Muroc Air Base\r\ntesting area, and over the super-secret research base near Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nSeveral times saucers have paced both military and civil aircraft;\r\ntheir actions strongly indicate deliberate encounters to learn our\r\nplanes’ speed and performance.\r\n\r\nIt seems obvious that both the planes and the bases were being\r\nobserved, and in some cases photographed by remote-control units or\r\nmanned space ships.\r\n\r\nAlthough I thought it improbable that the location of our uranium\r\ndeposits would be of interest to space men, a Washington official told\r\nme it would be relatively simple to detect the ore areas with airborne\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n“The Geological Survey has already developed special Geiger counters\r\nfor planes,” he told me. “They had a little trouble from cosmic-ray\r\nnoise. They finally had to cover the Geigers with lead shields.\r\nWhenever an important amount of radiation is present in the ground, the\r\nplane crew gets a signal, and they spot the place on their map. It’s a\r\nquick way of locating valuable deposits.”\r\n\r\nWhen I told him what I had in mind, he suggested an angle I had not\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n“Mind you,” he said, “I’m not completely sold on the interplanetary\r\nanswer. But assuming it’s correct that we’re being observed, I can\r\nthink of a stronger reason than fear of some distant attack. Some\r\natomic scientists say that a super-atomic bomb, or several set off at\r\nonce, could knock the earth out of its orbit. It sounds fantastic, but\r\nso is the A-bomb. It’s just possible that some solar-planet race\r\ndiscovered the dangers long ago. They would have good reason to worry\r\nif they found we were on that same track. There may be some other\r\natomic weapon we don’t suspect, even worse than the A-bomb, one that\r\ncould destroy the earth and seriously affect other planets.”\r\n\r\nAt the time, I thought this was just idle speculation. But since then,\r\nseveral atomic scientists have confirmed this official’s suggestion.\r\nOne of these was Dr. Paul Elliott, a nuclear physicist who worked on\r\nthe A-bomb during the war.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Elliott, if several hydrogen bombs were exploded\r\nsimultaneously at a high altitude, it could speed up the earth’s\r\nrotation or change its orbit. He based his statement on the rate of\r\nenergy the earth receives from the sun, a rate equal to some four\r\npounds of hydrogen exploded every second. Still other atomic scientists\r\nhave said that H-bomb explosions might even knock a large chunk out of\r\nthe earth, with unpredictable results.\r\n\r\nA dramatic picture of what might happen if the earth were forced far\r\nout of its orbit is indicated in the much-discussed book _Worlds in\r\nCollision_, by Dr. Immanuel Velikovsky, recently published by\r\nMacmillan. After many years of research, Dr. Velikovsky presents strong\r\nevidence that the planet Venus, when still a comet resulting from\r\neruption from a larger planet, moved erratically about the sky and\r\nviolently disturbed both the earth and Mars.\r\n\r\nWhen the comet approached the earth, our planet was forced out of its\r\norbit, according to Worlds in Collision. For a time, the world was on\r\nthe brink of destruction. Quoting many authentic ancient records,\r\nincluding the Quiché manuscript of the Mayas, the Ipuwer papyrus of the\r\nEgyptians, and the Visiddhi-Magga of the Buddhists, Dr. Velikovsky\r\ndescribes the cataclysm that took place. “The face of the earth\r\nchanged,” he writes in his book. The details, reinforced by the\r\nZend-Avesta of the Persians, tell of tremendous hurricanes, of a major\r\nupheaval in the earth’s surface, of oceans rushing over many parts of\r\nthe land, while rivers were driven from their beds. Some of the events\r\nin this period are mentioned in the Bible.\r\n\r\nProfessor Horace M. Kallen, former dean of the New School of Social\r\nResearch, strongly endorses Dr. Velikovsky’s statements: “It is my\r\nbelief that Velikovsky has supported his theses with substantial\r\nevidence and made an effective and persuasive argument.”\r\n\r\nMany other authorities endorse this work, which is documented with\r\nimpressive references. But even if this particular account is not\r\naccepted, all astronomers agree that the effect of a comet passing near\r\nthe earth would be appalling. _Worlds in Collision_ states that Mars,\r\nlike the earth, was pulled out of its orbit by the comet’s erratic\r\npassage. It may be that this near disaster to the earth and Mars is\r\nknown on other solar planets, or remembered on Mars itself, if the\r\nplanet is inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of super-bomb explosions on the earth understandably\r\ndisturb any dwellers on other solar-system planets.\r\n\r\nThis may be what was back of the Project “Saucer” statement on the\r\nprobable motives of any visitors from space. I mentioned this Air Force\r\nstatement in an earlier chapter, but it may be of interest to repeat it\r\nat this time. The comment appeared in a confidential analysis of\r\nIntelligence reports, in the formerly secret Project “Saucer” document,\r\n“Report on Unidentified Aerial and Celestial Objects.” It reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“Such a civilization might observe that on earth we now have atomic\r\nbombs and are fast developing rockets. In view of the past history of\r\nmankind, they should be alarmed. We should therefore expect at this\r\ntime above all to behold such visitations.\r\n\r\n“Since the acts of mankind most easily observed from a distance are\r\nA-bomb explosions, we should expect some relation to obtain between the\r\ntime of the A-bomb explosions, the time at which the space ships are\r\nseen, and the time required for such ships to arrive from and return to\r\nhome base.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was early in October 1949 when I finished the reversal of our\r\nspace-exploration plans. I spent the next two days running down a\r\nsighting report from a town in Pennsylvania. Like three or four other\r\ntips that had seemed important at first, it turned out to be a dud.\r\n\r\nWhen I got back home, I found Ken Purdy had been trying to reach me. I\r\nphoned him at True, and he asked me to fly up to New York the next day.\r\n\r\n“I’ve just heard there’s another magazine working on the saucer story,”\r\nhe told me.\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” I said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know yet. It may be just a rumor, but we can’t take a chance.\r\nWe’ve got to get this in the January book.”\r\n\r\nThat night I gathered up all the material. It looked hopeless to\r\ncondense it into one article, and I knew that Purdy had even more\r\ninvestigators’ reports waiting for me in New York. Flying up the next\r\nmorning, I suddenly thought of a talk I’d had with an air transport\r\nofficial. It was in Washington; I had just told him about the\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n“If they are spacemen,” he said, “they’d probably have a hard time\r\nfiguring out this country by listening to our broadcasts. Imagine\r\ntuning in soap operas, ‘The Lone Ranger,’ and a couple of crime yarns,\r\nalong with newscasts about strikes and murders and the cold war. They\r\nmight pick up some of those kid programs about rocket ships. A few days\r\nof listening to that stuff—well, it would give them one hell of a\r\npicture.”\r\n\r\nExcept for some hoax reports, this was the first funny suggestion I’d\r\nhad about the spacemen. But now, thinking seriously about it, I\r\nrealized he had an important point. It was possible that men from\r\nanother planet might have to reorient even their way of thinking to\r\nunderstand the earth’s ways. It would not be automatic, despite their\r\nsuperior technical progress. Evolution might have produced basic\r\ndifferences in their understanding of life. Humor, for instance, might\r\nbe totally lacking in their make-up.\r\n\r\nWhat would they be like?\r\n\r\nI’d tried to imagine how they might look, without getting anywhere. Dr.\r\nH. Spencer Jones hadn’t helped much with his _Life on Other Worlds_. I\r\ncouldn’t begin to visualize beings with totally different cells,\r\nperhaps able to take terrific heat or bitter cold as merely normal\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThere were all kinds of possibilities. If they lived on Mars, for\r\ninstance, perhaps they couldn’t take the heavier gravity of the earth.\r\nThey might be easily subject to our diseases, especially if they had\r\ndestroyed disease germs on their planet—a natural step for an advanced\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt was possible, I knew, that the spacemen might look grotesque to us.\r\nBut I clung to a Stubborn feeling that they would resemble man. That\r\ncame, of course, from an inborn feeling of man’s superiority over all\r\nliving things. It carried over into a feeling that any thinking,\r\nintelligent being, whether on Mars or Wolf 359’s planets, should have\r\nevolved in the same form.\r\n\r\nI gave up trying to imagine how the spacemen might look. There was\r\nsimply nothing to go on. But there were strong indications of how they\r\nthought and reacted. Certain qualities were plainly evident.\r\n\r\n_Intelligence_. No one could dispute that. It took a high order of\r\nmentality to construct and operate a space ship.\r\n\r\n_Courage_. It would take brave men to face the hazards of space.\r\n\r\n_Curiosity_. Without this quality, they would never have thought to\r\nexplore far-distant planets.\r\n\r\nThere were other qualities that seemed almost equally certain. These\r\nspacemen apparently lacked belligerence; there had been no sign of\r\nhostility through all the years. They were seemingly painstaking and\r\nextremely methodical.\r\n\r\nIt was still not much of a picture. But somehow, it was encouraging.\r\nGlancing down from the plane’s window, I thought: How does this look to\r\nthem? Our farms, our cities, the railroads there below; the highways,\r\nwith the speeding cars and trucks; the winding river, and far off to\r\nthe right, the broad stretch of the Atlantic. What would they think of\r\nAmerica?\r\n\r\nManhattan came into sight, as the pilot let down for the landing. An\r\nodd thought popped into my mind. How would a spaceman react if he saw a\r\nBroadway show?\r\n\r\nNot long before, I had seen South Pacific. I could still hear Ezio\r\nPinza’s magnificent voice as he sang “Some Enchanted Evening.”\r\n\r\nWas music a part of spacemen’s lives, or would it be something new and\r\nstrange, perhaps completely distasteful?\r\n\r\nThey might live and think on a coldly intelligent level, without a\r\ntouch of what we know as emotion. To them, our lives might seem\r\nmeaningless and dull. We ourselves might appear grotesque in form.\r\n\r\nBut in their progress, there must have been struggle, trial and error,\r\nsome feeling of triumph at success. Surely these would be emotional\r\nforces, bound to reflect in the planet races. Perhaps, in spite of some\r\ndifferences, we would find a common bond—the bond of thinking,\r\nintelligent creatures trying to better themselves.\r\n\r\nThe airliner landed and taxied in to unload.\r\n\r\nAs I went down the gangway I suddenly realized something. My last vague\r\nfear was gone.\r\n\r\nIt had not been a personal fear of the visitors from space. It had been\r\na selfish fear of the impact on my life. I realized that now.\r\n\r\nIt might be a long time before they would try to make contact. But I\r\nhad a conviction that when it came, it would be a peaceful mission, not\r\nan ultimatum. It could even be the means of ending wars on earth.\r\n\r\nBut I had been conditioned to this thing. I had had six months of\r\npreparation, six months to go from complete skepticism to slow, final\r\nacceptance.\r\n\r\nWhat if it had been thrown at me in black headlines?\r\n\r\nEven a peaceful contact by beings from another planet would profoundly\r\naffect the world. The story in _True_ might play an important part in\r\nthat final effect. Carefully done, it could help prepare Americans for\r\nthe official disclosure.\r\n\r\nBut if it weren’t done right, we might be opening a Pandora’s box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThat morning, at _True_, we made the final decisions on how to handle\r\nthe story. Using the evidence of the Mantell case, the Chiles-Whitted\r\nreport, Gorman’s mystery-light encounter, and other authentic cases,\r\nalong with the records of early sightings, we would state our main\r\nconclusion: _that the flying saucers were interplanetary_.\r\n\r\nIn going over the mass of reports, Purdy and I both realized that a few\r\nsightings did not fit the space-observer pattern. Most of these reports\r\ncame from the southwest states, where guided-missile experiments were\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nPurdy agreed with Paul Redell that any long-range tests would be made\r\nover the sea or unpopulated areas, with every attempt at secrecy.\r\n\r\n“They might make short-range tests down there in New Mexico and\r\nArizona-maybe over Texas,” he said. “But they’d never risk killing\r\npeople by shooting the things all over the country.”\r\n\r\n“They’ve already set up a three-thousand-mile range for the longer\r\nruns,” I added. “It runs from Florida into the South Atlantic. And the\r\nNavy missiles at Point Mugu are launched out over the Pacific. Any\r\nguided missiles coming down over settled areas would certainly be an\r\naccident. Besides all that, no missile on earth can explain these major\r\ncases.”\r\n\r\nPurdy was emphatic about speculating on our guided-missile research.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you analyzed these minor cases that look like missile tests.\r\nYou might accidentally give away something important, like their range\r\nand speeds. Look what the Russians did with the A-bomb hints Washington\r\nlet out.”\r\n\r\nIt was finally decided that we would briefly mention the guided\r\nmissiles, along with the fact that the armed services had flatly denied\r\nany link with the saucers.\r\n\r\n“After all, interplanetary travel is the main story,” said Purdy. “And\r\nthe Mantell case alone proves we’ve been observed from space ships,\r\neven without the old records.”\r\n\r\nThe question of the story’s impact worried both of us. public\r\nacceptance of intelligent life on other planets would affect almost\r\nevery phase of our existence-business, defense planning, philosophy,\r\neven religion. Of course, the immediate effect was more important.\r\nPersonally, I thought that most Americans could take even an official\r\nannouncement without too much trouble. But I could be wrong.\r\n\r\n“The only yardstick—and that’s not much good—is that ‘little men’\r\nstory,” said Purdy. “A lot of people have got excited about it, but\r\nthey seem more interested than scared.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the “little men from Venus” had been circulating for some\r\ntime. In the usual version, two flying saucers had come down near our\r\nsouthwest border. In the space craft were several oddly dressed men,\r\nthree feet high. All of them were dead; the cause was usually given as\r\ninability to stand our atmosphere. The Air Force was said to have\r\nhushed up the story, so that the public could be educated gradually to\r\nthe truth. Though it had all the earmarks of a well-thought-out hoax,\r\nmany newspapers had repeated the story. It had even been broadcast as\r\nfact on several radio newscasts. But there had been no signs of public\r\nalarm.\r\n\r\n“It looks as if people have come a long way since that Orson Welles\r\nscare,” I said to Purdy.\r\n\r\n“But there isn’t any menace in this story,” he objected. “The crews\r\nwere reported dead, so everybody got the idea that spacemen couldn’t\r\nlive if they landed. What if a space ship should suddenly come down\r\nover a big city—say New York—low enough for millions of people to see\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“it might cause a stampede,” I said,\r\n\r\nPurdy snorted. “it would be a miracle if it didn’t, unless people had\r\nbeen fully prepared. if we do a straight fact piece, just giving the\r\nevidence, it will start the ball rolling. People at least will be\r\nthinking about it.”\r\n\r\nBefore I left for Washington, I told Purdy of my last visit to the\r\nPentagon. I had informed Air Force press relations officials of True’s\r\nintention to publish the space-travel answer. There had been no attempt\r\nto dissuade me. And I had been told once again that there was no\r\nsecurity involved; that Project “Saucer” had found nothing threatening\r\nthe safety of America.\r\n\r\nAt this time I had also asked if Project “Saucer” files were now\r\navailable. The Wright Field unit, I was told, still was a classified\r\nproject, both its files and its photographs secret. This had been the\r\nfirst week in October.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked if there was any other information on published cases, the\r\nanswer again was negative. The April 27th report, according to Press\r\nBranch officials, was still an accurate statement of Air Force opinions\r\nand policies. So far as they knew, no other explanations had be n found\r\nfor the unidentified saucers.\r\n\r\n‘I in absolutely convinced now,” I told Purdy, “that here’s an official\r\npolicy to let the thing leak out. It explains why Forrestal announced\r\nour Earth Satellite Vehicle program, years before we could even start\r\nto build it. It also would explain those Project ‘Saucer’ hints in the\r\nApril report.”\r\n\r\n“I think we’re being used as a trial balloon,” Purdy said thoughtfully.\r\n“We’ve let them know what we’re doing. If they’d wanted to stop us, the\r\nAir Force could easily have done it. All they’d have to do would be\r\ncall us in, give us the dope off the record, and tell us it was a\r\npatriotic duty to keep still. Just the way they did about uranium and\r\natomic experiments during the war.”\r\n\r\nHe still did not have the name of the other magazine supposed to be\r\nworking on the saucers. But it seemed a reliable tip (it later proved\r\nto be true), and from then on we worked under high pressure.\r\n\r\nIn writing the article, I used only the most authentic recent\r\nsightings; all of the cases were in the Air Force reports. When it came\r\nto the Mantell case, I stuck to published estimates of the strange\r\nobject’s size; a mysterious ship 250 to 300 feet in diameter was\r\nstartling enough. At first, I chose Mars to illustrate our space\r\nexplorations. But Mars had been associated with the Orson Welles\r\nstampede. Most discussions of the planet had a menacing note, perhaps\r\nbecause of its warlike name.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I switched to a planet of Wolf 359. The thought of those\r\neight light-years would have a comforting effect on any nervous\r\nreaders. The chance of any mass visitation would seem remote, if not\r\nimpossible. But it would still put across the space-travel story.\r\n\r\nAs finally revised, the article, written under my byline, stated the\r\nfollowing points as the conclusions reached by _True_:\r\n\r\n1. For the past 175 years, the earth has been under systematic\r\nclose-range examination by living, intelligent observers from another\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n2. The intensity of this observation, and the frequency of the visits\r\nto the earth’s atmosphere, have increased markedly during the past two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n3. The vehicles used for this observation and for interplanetary\r\ntransport by the explorers have been classed as follows: Type I, a\r\nsmall, nonpilot-carrying disk-shaped craft equipped with some form of\r\ntelevision or impulse transmitter; Type II, a very large, metallic,\r\ndisk-shaped aircraft operating on the helicopter principle; Type III, a\r\ndirigible-shaped, wingless aircraft that, in the Earth’s atmosphere,\r\noperates in conformance with the Prandtl theory of lift.\r\n\r\n4. The discernible patterns of observation and exploration shown by the\r\nso-called flying disks varies in no important particular from\r\nwell-developed American plans for the exploration of space, expected to\r\ncome to fruition within the next fifty years. There is reason to\r\nbelieve, however, that some other race of thinking beings is a matter\r\nof two and a quarter centuries ahead of us.\r\n\r\nFollowing these points, I added a brief comment on the possibility of\r\nguided missiles, adding that the Air Force had convincingly denied this\r\nas an explanation of any sightings. As Purdy had suggested, I carefully\r\nomitted ten minor cases that I thought might be linked with\r\nguided-missile research. If disclosing the facts about space travel\r\nhelped to divert attention from any secret tests, so much the better.\r\n\r\n“_True_ accepts the official denial of any secret device,” I stated,\r\n“because the weight of the evidence, especially the world-wide\r\nsightings, does not support such a belief.”\r\n\r\nMost readers, of course, would know that some guided-missile\r\nexperiments were going on, and that _True_ was fully aware of it. But\r\nour main purpose would be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the earth had been observed by beings from another planet\r\nwould be fully presented. Some readers, of course, would reject even\r\nthe fact that the saucers existed. Others would cling to the idea that\r\nthey were of earthly origin. But the mass of evidence would make most\r\nreaders think. At the very least, it would plant one strong suggestion:\r\n_that we, men and women of the earth, are not the only intelligent\r\nspecies in the universe_. When the article was finished, it was tried\r\nout on True’s staff, then on a picked group that had not known about\r\nthe investigation. One editor summed up the average opinion:\r\n\r\n“It will cause a lot of discussion, but the way it’s written, it\r\nshouldn’t start any panic.”\r\n\r\nThe January issue, in which the story ran, was due on the stands\r\nshortly after Christmas. With my family, I had gone to Ottumwa, Iowa,\r\nto spend the holidays with my mother and sister. While I was there, the\r\nstory broke unexpectedly on radio networks.\r\n\r\nFrank Edwards, Mutual network newscaster, led off the radio comment. He\r\nwas followed by Walter Winchell, Lowell Thomas, Morgan Beatty, and most\r\nof the other radio commentators. The wire services quickly picked it\r\nup; some papers ran front-page stories.\r\n\r\nThe publicity was far more than I had expected. I phoned a reporter in\r\nWashington whose beat includes the Pentagon.\r\n\r\n“The Air Force is running around in circles,” he told me. “They knew\r\nyour story was due, but nobody thought it would raise such a fuss. I\r\nthink they’re scared of hysteria. They’re getting a barrage of wires\r\nand telephone calls.”\r\n\r\nThat night, as I was packing to rush back east, he called with the\r\nlatest news.\r\n\r\n“They’re going to deny the whole thing,” he said. “But’ I heard one\r\nPress Branch guy say it might not be enough —they’re trying to figure\r\nsome way to knock it down fast.”\r\n\r\nNext day, while changing trains at Chicago, I saw the Air Force\r\nstatement. The press release was dated December 27, 1949. Without\r\nmentioning _True_, the Air Force flatly denied having any evidence that\r\nflying saucers exist. After examining 375 reports, the release said,\r\nProject “Saucer” had found that they were caused by:\r\n\r\n1. Misinterpretation of various conventional objects.\r\n\r\n2. A mild form of mass hysteria or “war nerves.”\r\n\r\n3. Individuals who fabricate such reports to perpetrate a hoax or to\r\nseek publicity.\r\n\r\nEvaluation of the reports of unidentified flying objects, said the Air\r\nForce, demonstrates that they constitute no direct threat to the\r\nnational security of the United States.\r\n\r\nThen came the clincher: Project “Saucer,” said the Air Force, had been\r\ndiscontinued, now that all the reports had been explained.\r\n\r\nIt was plain that the release had been hastily prepared. It completely\r\ncontradicted the detailed Project “Saucer” report, issued eight months\r\nbefore, that had called for constant vigilance, after admitting that\r\nmost important cases were unsolved. Anyone familiar with the situation\r\nwould see the discrepancy at once.\r\n\r\nFrom Washington I flew to New York, where I found _True_ in a turmoil.\r\nLong-distance calls were pouring in. Letters on flying saucers had\r\nswamped the mail room. Reporters were hounding Purdy for more\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nA hurried analysis of the first hundred letters showed a trend that\r\nlater mail confirmed. Less than 5 per cent of the readers ridiculed the\r\narticle. Between 15 and 20 per cent said they were not convinced; a few\r\nof these admitted they could not refute the evidence. About half the\r\nreaders accepted the possibility; most of these said they saw no reason\r\nwhy other planets should not be inhabited. The remainder, between 25\r\nand 30 per cent, said they were completely convinced.\r\n\r\nEven the disbelievers asked for more information. The intelligence\r\nlevel of the average letter was gratifyingly high. Comments came from\r\nscientists, engineers, airline and private pilots, college professors,\r\nofficers of the armed services, and a wide variety of others—including\r\nfar more women than _True’s_ readership usually includes.\r\n\r\nSeveral confidential tips had come in when I arrived. Most of them were\r\nfrom usually reputable sources. We were given evidence that Project\r\n“Saucer” was still in operation; since its true code name was not\r\n“Saucer,” it could be continued without violating the Air Force press\r\nrelease. This same information was received from a dozen sources within\r\nthe next two weeks. We were also told that there had been 722 cases,\r\ninstead of 375.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a number of astronomers had come out with statements, pro and\r\ncon. One of these was Dr. Dean B. McLaughlin, of the University of\r\nMichigan.\r\n\r\n“No one knows what the saucers are as yet,” Dr. McLaughlin said. “They\r\ncould be anything, and I’m willing to be convinced once the evidence is\r\npresented.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bart J. Bok of Harvard was on the fence: “After all,” he said, “all\r\nsort of things float around in space. But I’m not convinced the saucers\r\nare anything apart from the earth.”\r\n\r\nAnother Harvard astronomer, Dr. Armin J. Deutsch, took an oblique poke\r\nat True and me. “I don’t think anyone—and that includes\r\nastronomers—knows enough about them to reach any conclusions.”\r\n\r\nAfter this came the comment of Dr. Carl F. von Weizacker—that billions\r\nof stars may have planets, and many could be inhabited.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days we had a huge stack of clippings, some supporting\r\n_True_, some deriding us. In the midst of all this, I read scientists’\r\ncomments on Einstein’s new unified-field theory, which had been printed\r\nabout the time _True_ appeared on the stands. A discussion by Lincoln\r\nBarnett, author of _The Universe and Dr. Einstein_, explained the basic\r\npremise—that gravitation and electromagnetic force are inseparable. As\r\nI read it, I thought of what Redell had said. If gravitation were a\r\nmanifestation of electromagnetic force, was it possible that an\r\nadvanced race had found a way—as unique as splitting the atom—to offset\r\ngravity and utilize that force?\r\n\r\nIt was during these first tense days that we ran down the White Sands\r\nstory. This also ended another puzzle—the identity of the magazine that\r\nwe had feared might scoop us. The race had been closer than we knew.\r\nThe editors of a national magazine had learned of Commander McLaughlin\r\nand the sightings at White Sands. Two of the staff had carefully\r\ninvestigated the details. Convinced that the report was accurate, they\r\nhad planned to run the story in an early issue.\r\n\r\nSince _True_ had appeared first with the space-travel story, the\r\neditors agreed to release the McLaughlin report for use in our March\r\nissue. The basic facts were in close agreement with what Redell had\r\ntold me.\r\n\r\nThe ellipsoid-shaped saucer had been tracked at a height of 56 miles,\r\nits speed 5 miles per second. This was 18,000 miles per hour, even\r\nfaster than Redell had said. The strange craft, 105 feet in length, had\r\nclimbed as swiftly as Marvin Miles had described it—an increase in\r\naltitude of about 25 miles in 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nCommander McLaughlin stated in his article that he was convinced the\r\nobject was a space ship from another planet, operated by animate,\r\nintelligent beings. He also described two small circular objects, about\r\ntwenty inches in diameter, that streaked up beside a Navy high-altitude\r\nmissile. After maneuvering around it for a moment, both disks\r\naccelerated, passed the fast-moving Navy missile, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt is Commander McLaughlin’s opinion that the saucers come from Mars.\r\nPointing out that Mars was in a good position to see our surface on\r\nJuly 16, 1945, he believes that the flash of the first A-bomb, at\r\nAlamogordo Base, a point not far from White Sands, was caught by\r\npowerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of January, I appeared on “We, the People,” with\r\nLieutenant George Gorman. When I saw Gorman, before rehearsals, he\r\nseemed oddly constrained. I had a feeling that he had been warned about\r\ntalking freely. During rehearsals, he changed his lines in the script.\r\nWhen the writers argued over a point, Gorman told them:\r\n\r\n“I can say only what was in my published report—nothing else.”\r\n\r\nThe day before the broadcast, a program official told me they had been\r\ntold to include the Air Force denial in the script. That afternoon I\r\nlearned that the Air Force planned to monitor the broadcast.\r\n\r\nMeantime, an A.P. story carried a new Air Force announcement. Formerly\r\nsecret Project “Saucer” files would be opened to newsmen at the\r\nPentagon, giving the answers to all the saucer reports.\r\n\r\nJust after my return to Washington, I saw an I.N.S. story that was\r\nwidely printed. It was an interview with Major Jerry Boggs, a Project\r\n“Saucer” Intelligence officer who served as liaison man between Wright\r\nField and the Pentagon. Major Boggs had been asked for specific answers\r\nto the Mantell, Chiles-Whitted, and Gorman cases.\r\n\r\nThe answers he gave amazed me. I picked up the phone and called the Air\r\nForce Press Branch. After some delay, I was told that Major Boggs was\r\nbeing briefed for assignment to Germany. An interview would be almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t too busy to talk with I.N.S.,” I said. “All I want is thirty\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nLater, Jack Shea, a civilian press official I had known for some time,\r\narranged for the meeting. I was also to talk with General Sory Smith,\r\nDeputy Director for Air Information.\r\n\r\nMajor Jesse Stay, a Press Branch officer, took me to General Smith’s\r\noffice for the interview. Both Jesse and Jack Shea, pleasant, obliging\r\nchaps who had helped me in the past, tried earnestly to convince me the\r\nsaucers didn’t exist. Jesse was still trying when Major Boggs came in.\r\n\r\nBoggs looked to be in his twenties, younger than I had expected. He was\r\ntrim, well built, with a quietly alert face. Two rows of ribbons\r\ntestified to his wartime service. When Jesse Stay introduced me, Boggs\r\ngave me a curiously searching look. It could have been merely his usual\r\nway of appraising people he met. But all through our talk, I had a\r\nstrong feeling that he was on his guard.\r\n\r\nI had written out some questions, but first I mentioned the I.N.S.\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n“Were you quoted correctly on the Mantell case?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I was.” Major Boggs looked me squarely in the eye. “Captain\r\nMantell was chasing the planet Venus.”\r\n\r\nIt was so incredible that I shook my head. “Major, Venus; was\r\npractically invisible that day. We’ve checked with astronomers. Is that\r\nthe official Air Force answer?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is,” Boggs said. His eyes never left my face. I glanced across\r\nat General Sory Smith, then back at the intelligence major.\r\n\r\n“That’s a flat contradiction of Project ‘Saucer’s’ report. Last April,\r\nafter they had checked for fifteen months, they said positively it was\r\n_not_ Venus. It was still unidentified.”\r\n\r\nBoggs said, in a slow, unruffled voice, “They rechecked after that\r\nreport.”\r\n\r\n“Why did they recheck, after fifteen months?” I asked him. “‘They must\r\nhave gone over those figures long before that, for errors.”\r\n\r\nIf my question annoyed him, Boggs gave no sign.\r\n\r\nThere’s no other possible answer,” he said. “Mantell was chasing\r\nVenus.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment after Boggs’s last answer, I had an impulse to end the\r\ninterview. I had a feeling I was facing a sphinx—a quiet, courteous\r\nsphinx in an Air Force uniform.\r\n\r\nI was sure now why Major Jerry Boggs had been chosen for his job, the\r\nall-important connecting link with the project at Wright Field. No one\r\nwould ever catch this man off guard, no matter what secret was given\r\nhim to conceal. And it was more than the result of Air Force\r\nIntelligence training. His manner, his voice carried conviction. He\r\nwould have convinced anyone who had not carefully analyzed the Godman\r\nField tragedy.\r\n\r\nI made one more attempt. “Do the Godman Field witnesses—Colonel Hix and\r\nthe rest—believe the Venus answer?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t asked them,” said Boggs, “so I couldn’t say.”\r\n\r\n“What about the Chiles-Whitted case?” I asked. “You were quoted as\r\nsaying they saw a meteor—a bolide that exploded in a shower of sparks.”\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” said Boggs.\r\n\r\n“And Gorman was chasing a lighted balloon?”\r\n\r\nAgain the Intelligence major nodded. I pointed, out that all three of\r\nthe cases mentioned had been listed as unidentified in the April\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n“They’d had those cases for months,” I said. “What new facts did they\r\nlearn?”\r\n\r\nBoggs said calmly, “They just made a final analysis, and those were the\r\nanswers.”\r\n\r\nWe looked at each other a moment. Major Boggs patiently waited. I began\r\nto realize how a lawyer must feel with an imperturbable witness. And\r\nBoggs’s unfailing courtesy began to make me embarrassed.\r\n\r\n“Major,” I said, “I hope you’ll realize this is not a personal matter.\r\nAs an Intelligence officer, if you’re told to give certain answers—”\r\n\r\nHe smiled for the first time. “That’s all right—but I’m not hiding a\r\nthing. There’s just no such thing as a flying saucer, so far as we’ve\r\nfound out.”\r\n\r\n“We’ve been told,” I said, “that Project ‘Saucer’ isn’t closed—that you\r\njust changed its code name.”\r\n\r\n“That’s not so,” Boggs said emphatically. “The contracts are ended, and\r\nall personnel transferred to other duty.”\r\n\r\n“Then the announcement wasn’t caused by _True’s_ article?”\r\n\r\nBoth General Smith and Major Jesse Stay shook their heads quickly.\r\nBoggs leaned forward, eyeing me earnestly.\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, we’d finished the investigation months ago—around\r\nthe end of August, or early in September. We just hadn’t got around to\r\nannouncing it.”\r\n\r\n“Last October,” I said, “I was told the investigation was still going\r\non. They said there were no new answers to the cases just mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“The Press Branch hadn’t been informed yet,” Boggs explained simply.\r\n\r\n“It seems very strange to me,” I said. “In April, the Air Force called\r\nfor vigilance by the civilian population. It said the project was\r\nyoung, much of its work still under way.”\r\n\r\nJesse Stay interrupted before Boggs could reply.\r\n\r\n“Don, the Press Branch will have to take the blame for that. The report\r\nwasn’t carefully checked. There were several loose statements in it.”\r\n\r\nThis was an incredible statement. I was sure Jesse knew it.\r\n\r\n“But the case reports you quoted came from Wright Field. As of April\r\ntwenty-seventh, 1949, all the major cases were officially unsolved.\r\nThen in August or early September, the whole thing’s cleaned up, from\r\nwhat Major Boggs says. That’s pretty hard to believe.”\r\n\r\nNo one answered that one. Major Boggs was waiting politely for the next\r\nquestion. I picked up my list. The rest of the interview was in\r\nstraight question-and-answer style:\r\n\r\nQ. Do you know about the White Sands sightings in April 1948? The ones\r\nCommander R. B. McLaughlin has written up?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, we checked the reports. We just don’t believe them.\r\n\r\nQ. One of the witnesses was Charles B. Moore, the director of the Navy\r\ncosmic-ray project at Minneapolis, He’s considered a very reputable\r\nengineer. Did you know he confirms the first report—the one about the\r\nsaucer 56 miles up, at a speed of eighteen thousand miles per hour.\r\n\r\nA. Yes, I knew about him. We think he was mistaken, like the others.\r\n\r\nQ. Mr. Moore says it was absolutely sure it was not hallucination. He\r\nsays it should be carefully investigated.\r\n\r\nA. We did investigate. We just don’t believe they saw anything.\r\n\r\nQ. Could I see the complete file on that case? Also on Mantell, Gorman,\r\nand the Eastern Airlines cases?\r\n\r\nA. That’s out of my province.\r\n\r\nQ. If Project “Saucer” is ended, then all the files should be opened.\r\n\r\nA. Well, the summaries have been cleared, and you can see them.\r\n\r\nQ. No, I mean the actual files. Is there any reason I shouldn’t see\r\nthem?\r\n\r\nA. There’d be a lot of material to search through. Each case has a\r\nseparate book, and some of them are pretty bulky.\r\n\r\nQ. There were 722 cases in all, weren’t there?\r\n\r\nA. No, nowhere near that.\r\n\r\nQ. Then 375 is the total figure—I mean the number of cases Project\r\n“Saucer” listed?\r\n\r\nA. There were a few more—something over four hundred. I don’t know the\r\nexact figure.\r\n\r\nQ. I’ve been told that Project “Saucer” had the Air Force put out a\r\nspecial order for pilots to chase flying saucers. Is that right?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, that’s right.\r\n\r\nQ. Did that include National Guard pilots?\r\n\r\nA. Yes, it did. When the project first started checking on saucers we\r\nwere naturally anxious to get hold of one of the things. We told the\r\npilots to do practically anything in reason, even if they had to grab\r\none by the tail.\r\n\r\nQ. Were any of those planes armed?\r\n\r\nA. Only if they happened to have guns for some other mission, like\r\ngunnery practice.\r\n\r\nQ. We’ve heard of one case where fighters chased a saucer to a high\r\naltitude. One of them emptied his guns at it.\r\n\r\nA. You must mean that New Jersey affair. The plane was armed for\r\nanother reason.\r\n\r\nQ. No, I meant a case reported out at Luke Field. Three fighters took\r\noff, if the story sent us is correct. Apparently it made quite a\r\ncommotion. That was back in 1945.\r\n\r\nA. It might have happened. I don’t know.\r\n\r\nQ. What was this New Jersey case?\r\n\r\nA. I’d rather not discuss any more cases without having the books here.\r\n\r\nQ. Has Project “Saucer” released its secret pictures?\r\n\r\nA. What pictures? There weren’t any that amounted to anything. Maybe\r\nhalf a dozen. They didn’t show anything, just spots on film or weather\r\nballoons at a distance.\r\n\r\nQ. In the Kenneth Arnold case, didn’t some forest rangers verify his\r\nreport?\r\n\r\nA. Well, there were some people who claimed they saw the same disks.\r\nBut we found out later they’d heard about it on the radio.\r\n\r\nQ. Didn’t they draw some sketches that matched Arnold’s?\r\n\r\nA. I never heard about it.\r\n\r\nQ. I’d like to go back to the Mantell case a second. If Venus was so\r\nbright—remember Mantell thought it was a huge metallic object—why\r\ndidn’t the pilot who made the search later on—\r\n\r\nA. Well, it was Venus, that’s positive. But I can’t remember all the\r\ndetails without the case books.\r\n\r\nQ. One more question, Major. Have any reports been received at Wright\r\nField since Project “Saucer” closed? There was a case after that date,\r\nan airliner crew—\r\n\r\nAt this point, Major Jesse Stay broke in.\r\n\r\n“It’s all up to the local commanders now. If they want to receive\r\nreports of anything unusual, all right. And if they want to investigate\r\nthem, that’s up to each commander. But no Project ‘Saucer’ teams will\r\ncheck on reports. That’s all ended.”\r\n\r\nThere at the last, it had been a little. like a courtroom scene, and I\r\nwas glad the interview was over. Major Boggs was unruffled as ever. I\r\napologized for the barrage of questions, and thanked him for being so\r\ndecent about it.\r\n\r\n“It was interesting, getting your viewpoint,” he said. He smiled, still\r\nthe courteous sphinx, and went on out.\r\n\r\nAfter Bogs had left, I talked with General Smith alone. I told him I\r\nwas not convinced,\r\n\r\n“I’d like to see the complete files on these cases I mentioned,” I\r\nexplained. “Also, I’d like to talk with the last commanding officer or\r\nsenior Intelligence officer attached to Project ‘Saucer.’”\r\n\r\n“I’m not sure about the senior officer,” General Smith answered. “He\r\nmay have been detached already. But I don’t see any reason why you\r\ncan’t see those files. I’ll phone Wright Field and call you.”\r\n\r\nI was about to leave, but he motioned for me to sit down.\r\n\r\n“I can understand how you feel about the Mantell report,” General Smith\r\nsaid earnestly. “I knew Tommy Mantell very well. And Colonel Hix is a\r\nclassmate of mine. I knew neither one was the kind to have\r\nhallucinations. That case got me, at first.”\r\n\r\n“You believe Venus is the true answer?” I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised. “It must be, if Wright Field says so.”\r\n\r\nWhen I went back to the Press Branch, I asked Jack Shea for the\r\ncase-report summaries that Boggs had mentioned, He got them for me—two\r\ncollections of loose-leaf mimeographed sheets enclosed in black\r\nbinders. So these were the “secret files”!\r\n\r\nAcross the hall, in the press room, I opened one book at random. The\r\nfirst thing I saw was this:\r\n\r\n“A meteorologist should compute the approximate energy required to\r\nevaporate as much cloud as shown in the incident 26 photographs.”\r\n\r\nPhotographs. Major Boggs had said there were no important pictures. I\r\ntucked the binders under my arm and went out to my car. Perhaps these\r\nbooks hinted at more than Boggs had realized. But that didn’t seem\r\nlikely. As liaison man, he should know all the answers. I was almost\r\npositive that he did.\r\n\r\nBut I was equally sure they weren’t the answers he had given me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night I went through the Project “Saucer” summary of cases. It was\r\na strange experience.\r\n\r\nThe first report I checked was the Mantell case. Nothing that Boggs had\r\nsaid had changed my firm opinion. I knew the answer was not Venus, and\r\nI was certain Boggs knew it, too.\r\n\r\nThe Godman Field incident was listed as Case 33. The report also\r\ntouches on the Lockbourne Air Base sighting. As already described, the\r\nsame mysterious object, or a similar one, was seen moving at five\r\nhundred miles an hour over Lockbourne Field. It was also sighted at\r\nother points in Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe very first sentence in Case 33 showed a determined attempt to\r\nexplain away the object that Mantell chased:\r\n\r\n“Detailed attention should be given to any possible astronomical body\r\nor phenomenon which might serve to identify the object or objects.”\r\n\r\n(Some of the final Project report on Mantell has been given in an\r\nearlier chapter. I am repeating a few paragraphs below, to help in\r\nweighing Major Boggs’s answer.)\r\n\r\nThese are official statements of the Project astronomer:\r\n\r\n“On January 7, 1948, Venus was less than half its full brilliance.\r\nHowever, under exceptionally good atmospheric conditions, and with the\r\neye shielded from the direct rays of the sun, Venus might be seen as an\r\nexceedingly tiny bright point of light. It is possible to see it in\r\ndaytime when one knows exactly where to look. Of course, the chances of\r\nlooking at the right spot are very few.\r\n\r\n“It has been unofficially reported that the object was a Navy cosmic\r\nray balloon. If this can be established it is to be preferred as an\r\nexplanation. However, if reports from other localities refer to the\r\nsame object, any such device must have been a good many miles high—25\r\nto 50—in order to have been seen clearly, almost simultaneously, from\r\nplaces 175 miles apart.”\r\n\r\nThis absolutely ruled out the balloon possibility, as the investigator\r\nfully realized. That he must have considered the space-ship answer at\r\nthis point is strongly indicated in the following sentence:\r\n\r\n“If all reports were of a single object, in the knowledge of this\r\ninvestigator no man-made object could have been large enough and far\r\nenough away for the approximate simultaneous sightings.”\r\n\r\nThe next paragraph of this Project “Saucer” report practically\r\nnullified Major Boggs’s statement that Venus was the sole explanation:\r\n\r\n“It is most unlikely, however, that so many separate persons should at\r\nthat time have chanced on Venus in the daylight sky. It seems therefore\r\nmuch more probable that more than one object was involved. The sighting\r\nmight have included two or more balloons (or aircraft) or they might\r\nhave included Venus (in the fatal chase) and balloons. . . . Such a\r\nhypothesis, however, does still necessitate the inclusion of at least\r\ntwo other objects than Venus, and it certainly is coincidental that so\r\nmany people would have chosen this one day to be confused (to the\r\nextent of reporting the matter) by normal airborne objects. . . .”\r\n\r\nFarther on in the summaries, I found a report that has an extremely\r\nsignificant bearing on the Mantell case. This was Case 175, in which\r\nthe same consultant attempts to explain a strange daylight sighting at\r\nSanta Fe, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nOne of the Santa Fe observers described the mysterious aerial object as\r\nround and extremely bright, “like a dime in the sky.” Here is what the\r\nProject “Saucer” investigator had to say:\r\n\r\n“The magnitude of Venus was -3.8 (approximately the same as on January\r\n7, 1948). it could have been visible in the daylight sky. It would have\r\nappeared, however, more like a pinpoint of brilliant light than ‘like a\r\ndime in the sky.’ It seems unlikely that it would be noticed at all. .\r\n. . Considering discrepancies in the two reports, I suggest the moon in\r\na gibbous phase; in daytime this is unusual and most people are not\r\nused to it, so that they fail to identify it. While this hypothesis has\r\nlittle to correspond to either report, it is worth mentioning.\r\n\r\n“It seems far more probable that some type of balloon was the object in\r\nthis case.”\r\n\r\nBoth the Godman Field and the Santa Fe cases were almost identical, so\r\nfar as the visibility of Venus was concerned. In the Santa Fe case,\r\nwhich had very little publicity, Project “Saucer” dropped the Venus\r\nexplanation as a practically impossible answer. But in Case 33, it had\r\ntried desperately to make Venus loom up as a huge gleaming object\r\nduring Mantell’s fatal chase.\r\n\r\nThere was only one explanation: Project “Saucer” must have known the\r\ntruth from the start-that Mantell had pursued a tremendous space ship.\r\nThat fact alone, if it had exploded in the headlines at that time,\r\nmight have caused dangerous panic. To make it worse, Captain Mantell\r\nhad been killed. Even if he had actually died from blacking out while\r\ntrying to follow the swiftly ascending space ship, few would have\r\nbelieved it. The story would spread like wildfire: _Spacemen kill an\r\nAmerican Air Force Pilot!_\r\n\r\nThis explained the tight lid that had been clamped down at once on the\r\nMantell case. It was more than a year before that policy had been\r\nchanged; then the first official discussions of possible space visitors\r\nhad begun to appear.\r\n\r\n_True’s_ plans to announce the interplanetary answer would have fitted\r\na program of preparing the people. But the Air Force had not expected\r\nsuch nation-wide reaction from _True’s_ article; that much I knew.\r\nEvidently, they had not suspected such a detailed analysis of the\r\nGodman Field case, in particular. I could see now why Boggs, Jesse\r\nStay, and the others had tried so hard to convince me that we had made\r\na mistake.\r\n\r\nIt was quite possible that we had revived that first Air Force fear of\r\ndangerous publicity. But Mantell had been dead for two years. News\r\nstories would not have the same impact now, even if they did report\r\nthat spacemen had downed the pilot. And I doubted that there would be\r\nheadlines. Unless the Air Force supplied some convincing details, the\r\nmanner of his death would still be speculation.\r\n\r\nApparently I had been right; this case was the key to the riddle. It\r\nhad been the first major sighting in 1948. Project “Saucer” had been\r\nstarted immediately afterward. In searching for a plausible answer,\r\nwhich could be published if needed, officials had probably set the\r\npattern for handling all other reports, “Explaining away” would be a\r\nlogical program, until the public could be prepared for an official\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\nAs I went through other case reports, I found increasing evidence to\r\nback up this belief.\r\n\r\nCase 1, the Muroc Air Base sightings, had plainly baffled Project men\r\nseeking a plausible answer. Because of the Air Force witnesses, they\r\ncould not ignore the reports. Highly trained Air Force test pilots and\r\nground officers had seen two fast-moving silver-colored disks circling\r\nover the base.\r\n\r\nFlying at speeds of from three to four hundred miles an hour, the disks\r\nwhirled in amazingly tight maneuvers. Since they were only eight\r\nthousand feet above the field, these turns could be clearly seen.\r\n\r\n“It is tempting to explain the object as ordinary aircraft observed\r\nunder unusual light conditions,” the case report reads. “But the\r\nevidence of tight circles, if maintained, is strongly contradictory.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Case 1 was technically in the “unexplained” group, Wright\r\nField had made a final effort to explain away the reports. Said the Air\r\nMateriel Command:\r\n\r\n“The sightings were the result of misinterpretation of real stimuli,\r\nprobably research balloons.”\r\n\r\nIn all the world’s history, there is no record of a\r\nthree-hundred-mile-an-hour wind. To cover the distance involved, the\r\ndrifting balloons would have had to move at this speed, or faster. If a\r\nthree-hundred-mile wind had been blowing at eight thousand feet,\r\nnothing on earth could have stood it, Muroc Air Base would have been\r\nblown off the map. What did the Muroc test pilots _really_ see that\r\nday?\r\n\r\nWhile searching for the Chiles-Whitted report, ran across the Fairfield\r\nSuisan mystery-light case, which I had learned about in Seattle. This\r\nwas Case 215. The Project “Saucer” comment reads:\r\n\r\n“If the observations were exactly as stated by the witnesses, the ball\r\nof light could not be a fireball. . . . A fireball would not have come\r\ninto view at 1,000 feet and risen to 20,000. If correct, there is no\r\nastronomical explanation. Under unusual conditions, a fireball might\r\nappear to rise somewhat as a result of perspective. The absence of\r\ntrail and sound definitely does not favor the meteor hypothesis, but .\r\n. . does not rule it out finally. It does not seem likely any meteor or\r\nauroral phenomenon could be as bright as this.”\r\n\r\nThen came one of the most revealing lines in all the case reports:\r\n\r\n“In the almost hopeless absence of any other natural explanation, one\r\nmust consider the possibility of the object’s having been a meteor,\r\neven though the description does not fit very well.”\r\n\r\nOne air-base officer, I recalled, had insisted that the object had been\r\na lighted balloon. Checking the secret report from the Air Weather\r\nService, I found this:\r\n\r\n“Case 2 15. Very high winds, 60-70 miles per hour from southwest, all\r\nlevels. Definitely prohibits any balloon from southerly motion.”\r\n\r\n_This case is officially listed as answered_.\r\n\r\nIn Case 19, where a cigar-shaped object was seen at Dayton, Ohio, the\r\nProject investigator made a valiant attempt to fit an answer:\r\n\r\n“Possibly a close pair of fireballs, but it seems unlikely. If one were\r\nto stretch the description to its very limits and make allowances for\r\nuntrained observers, he could say that the cigar-like shape might have\r\nbeen illusion caused by rapid motion, and that the bright sunlight\r\nmight have made both the objects and the trails nearly invisible.\r\n\r\n“This investigator does not prefer that interpolation, and it should he\r\nresorted to only if all other possible explanations fail.”\r\n\r\n_This case, too, is officially listed as answered_.\r\n\r\nCase 24, which occurred June 12, 1947, twelve days before the Arnold\r\nsighting, shows the same determined attempt to find an explanation, no\r\nmatter how farfetched.\r\n\r\nIn this case, two fast-moving objects were seen at Weiser, Idaho, Twice\r\nthey approached the earth, then swiftly circled upward. The Project\r\ninvestigator tried hard to prove that these might have been parts of a\r\ndouble fireball. But at the end, he said, “In spite of all this, this\r\ninvestigator would prefer a terrestrial explanation for the incident.”\r\n\r\nIt was plain that this report had not been planned originally for\r\nrelease to the public. No Project investigator would have been so\r\nfrank. With each new report, I was more and more convinced that these\r\nhad been confidential discussions of various possible answers,\r\ncirculated between Project “Saucer” officials. Why they had been\r\nreleased now was still a puzzle, though I began to see a glimmer of the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe Chiles-Whitted sighting was listed as Case 144. As I started on the\r\nreport, I wondered if Major Boggs’s “bolide” answer would have any more\r\nfoundation than these other “astronomical” cases.\r\n\r\nThe report began with these words:\r\n\r\n“There is no astronomical explanation, if we accept the report at face\r\nvalue. But the sheer improbability of the facts as stated, particularly\r\nin the absence of any known aircraft in the vicinity, makes it\r\nnecessary to see whether any other explanation, even though farfetched,\r\ncan be considered.”\r\n\r\nAfter this candid admission of his intentions, the Project consultant\r\nearnestly attempts to fit the two pilots’ space ship description to a\r\nslow-moving meteor.\r\n\r\n“It will have to be left to the psychologists,” he goes on, “to tell us\r\nwhether the immediate trail of a bright meteor could produce the\r\nsubjective impression of a ship with lighted windows. Considering only\r\nthe Chiles-Whitted sighting, the hypothesis seems very improbable.”\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in an earlier chapter, observers at Robbins Air Force\r\nBase, Macon, Georgia, saw the same mysterious object streak overhead,\r\ntrailing varicolored flames. This was about one hour before Chiles and\r\nWhitted saw the onrushing space ship.\r\n\r\nTo bolster up the meteor theory, the Project consultant suggests a\r\none-hour error in time. The explanation: The airliner would be on\r\ndaylight-saving time.\r\n\r\n“If there is no time difference,” he proceeds, “the. object must have\r\nbeen an extraordinary meteor. . . . in which case it would have covered\r\nthe distance from Macon to Montgomery in a minute or two.”\r\n\r\nHaving checked the time angle before, I knew this was incorrect. Both\r\nreports were given in eastern standard time. And in a later part of the\r\nProject report, the consultant admits this fact. But he has an\r\nalternate answer: “If the difference in time is real, the object was\r\nsome form of known aircraft, regardless of its bizarre nature.”\r\n\r\nThe “bizarre nature” is not specified. Nor does the Project “Saucer”\r\nreport try to fit the Robbins Field description to any earth-made\r\naircraft. The air-base observers were struck by the object’s huge size,\r\nits projectile-like shape, and the weird flames trailing behind. Except\r\nfor the double-deck windows, the air-base men’s description tallied\r\nwith the pilots’. With the ship at five thousand feet or higher, its\r\nwindows would not have been visible from the ground. All the observers\r\nagreed on the object’s very high speed.\r\n\r\nNeither of the Project “Saucer” alternate answers will fit the facts.\r\n\r\n1. The one-hour interval has been proved correct. Therefore, as the\r\nProject consultant admits, it could not be a meteor.\r\n\r\n2. The Robbins Field witnesses have flatly denied it was a conventional\r\nplane. The Air Force screened 225 airplane schedules, and proved there\r\nwas no such plane in the area. No ordinary aircraft would have caused\r\nthe brilliant streak that startled the DC-3 passenger and both of the\r\npilots.\r\n\r\nMajor Boggs’s bolide answer had gone the way of his Venus explanation.\r\nI wondered if the Gorman light-balloon solution would fade out the same\r\nway. But the Project report on Gorman (Case 172) merely hinted at the\r\nballoon answer. In the Appendix, there was a brief comment: “Note that\r\nstandard 30 inch and 65 inch weather balloons have vertical speeds of\r\n600 and 1100 feet per minute, respectively.”\r\n\r\nIn all the reports I have mentioned, and on through both the case\r\nbooks, one thing was immediately obvious. All the testimony, all the\r\nactual evidence was missing. These were only the declared conclusions\r\nof Project “Saucer.” Whether they matched the actual conclusions in\r\nWright Field secret files there was no way of knowing.\r\n\r\nBut even in these sketch reports, I found some odd hints, clues to what\r\nProject officials might really be thinking.\r\n\r\nAfter an analysis of two Indianapolis cases, one investigator reports:\r\n\r\n“Barring hallucination, these two incidents and 17, 75 and 84 seem the\r\nmost tangible from the standpoint of description, of all those\r\nreported, and the most difficult to explain away as sheer nonsense.”\r\n\r\nCase 17, I found, was that of Kenneth Arnold. But in spite of the above\r\nadmission that this case cannot be explained away, it is officially\r\nlisted as answered.\r\n\r\nCase 75 struck a familiar note. This was the strange occurrence at Twin\r\nFalls, Idaho, on which _True_ had had a tip months before. A disk\r\nmoving through a canyon at tremendous speed had whipped the treetops as\r\nif by a violent hurricane. The report was brief, but one sentence stood\r\nout with a startling effect:\r\n\r\n“Twin Falls, Idaho, August 13, 1847,” the report began. “There is\r\nclearly nothing astronomical in this incident. . . . Two points stand\r\nout, the sky-blue color, and the fact that the trees ‘spun around on\r\ntop as if they were in a vacuum.’”\r\n\r\nThen came the sentence that made me sit up in my chair.\r\n\r\n“Apparently it must be classed with the other bona fide disk\r\nsightings.”\r\n\r\n_The other bona fide sightings!_\r\n\r\nWas this a slip? Or had the Air Force deliberately left this report in\r\nthe file? If they had, what was back of it—what was back of releasing\r\nall of these telltale case summaries?\r\n\r\nI skimmed through the rest as quickly as possible looking for other\r\nclues. Here are a few of the things that. caught my eye:\r\n\r\nCase 10. United Airlines report . . . despite conjectures, no logical\r\nexplanation seems possible. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 122. Holloman Air Force Base, April 6, 1948. [This was the\r\nCommander McLaughlin White Sands report.] No logical explanation. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 124. North Atlantic, April 18, 1948 . . . radar sighting . . . no\r\nastronomical explanation. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 127.

Arnheim, The Hague, July 20, 1948 . . . object seen four\r\ntimes . . . had two decks and no wings . . . very high speed comparable\r\nto a V-2. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 183. Japan, October 15, 1948. Radar experts should determine\r\nacceleration rates. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 188. Goose Bay, Labrador, October 29, 1948. Not astronomical . . .\r\npicked up by radar . . . radar experts should evaluate the sightings .\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nCase 189. Goose Bay, Labrador, October 31, 1948 . . . not astronomical\r\n. . . observed on radarscope. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 196. Radarscope observation . . . object traveling directly into\r\nthe wind. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 198. Radar blimp moving at high speed and continuously changing\r\ndirection. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 222. Furstenfeldbruck, Germany, November 23, 1948 . . . object\r\nplotted by radar DF at 27,000 feet . . . short time later circling at\r\n40,000 feet . . . speed estimated 200-500 m.p.h. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 223 . . . seventeen individuals saw and reported object . . .\r\ngreen flare . . . all commercial and government airfield questioned . .\r\n. no success. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 224. Las Vegas, New Mexico, December 8, 1948 . . . description\r\nexactly as in 223 . . . flare reported traveling very high speed . . .\r\nvery accurate observation made by two F.B.I. agents. . . .\r\n\r\nCase 231 . . . another glowing green flare just as described above. . .\r\n.\r\n\r\nCase 233 . . . definitely no balloon . . . made turns . . . accelerated\r\nfrom 200 to 500 miles per hour . . . .\r\n\r\nGoing back over this group of cases, I made an incredible discovery:\r\nAll but three of these unsolved cases were officially listed as\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThe three were the United Airlines case, the White Sands sightings, and\r\nthe double-decked space-ship report from The Hague.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the first report, I checked all the summaries. Nine times\r\nout of ten, the explanations were pure conjecture. Sometimes no answer\r\nwas even attempted.\r\n\r\nAlthough 375 cases were mentioned, the summaries ended with Case 244.\r\nSeveral cases were omitted. I found clues to some of these in the\r\nsecret Air Weather Service report, including the mysterious “green\r\nlight” sightings at Las Vegas and Albuquerque.\r\n\r\nOf the remaining 228 cases, Project “Saucer” lists all but 34 as\r\nexplained. These unsolved cases are brought up again for a final\r\nattempt at explaining them away. In the appendix, the Air Materiel\r\nCommand carefully states:\r\n\r\n“It is not the intent to discredit the character of observers, but each\r\ncase has undesirable elements and these can’t be disregarded.”\r\n\r\nAfter this perfunctory gesture, the A.M.C. proceeds to discredit\r\ncompletely the testimony of highly trained Air Force test pilots and\r\nofficers at Muroc. (The 300-400 m.p.h. research balloon explanation.)\r\n\r\nThe A.M.C. then brushes off the report of Captain Emil Smith and the\r\ncrew of a United Airline plane. On July 4, 1947, nine huge flying disks\r\nwere counted by Captain Smith and his crew. The strange objects were in\r\nsight for about twelve minutes; the crew watched them for the entire\r\nperiod and described them in detail later.\r\n\r\nDespite Project “Saucer’s” admission that it had no answer, the A.M.C.\r\ncontrived one. Ignoring the evidence of veteran airline pilots, it\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Since the sighting occurred at sunset, when illusory effect are most\r\nlikely, the objects could have been ordinary aircraft, balloons, birds,\r\nor pure illusion.”\r\n\r\nIn only three cases did the A.M.C. admit it had no answer. Even here,\r\nit was implied that the witnesses were either confused or incompetent.\r\n\r\nIn its press release of December 27, 1949, the Air Force had mentioned\r\n375 cases. It implied that all of these were answered. The truth was\r\njust the reverse, as was proved by these case books. Almost two hundred\r\ncases still were shown to be unsolved-although the real answers might\r\nbe hidden in Wright Field files.\r\n\r\nThese two black books puzzled me. Why had the Air Force lifted its\r\nsecrecy on these case summaries? Why had Major Boggs given me those\r\nanswers, when these books would flatly refute them?\r\n\r\nI thought I new the reason now but there was only one way to make sure.\r\nThe actual Wright Field files should tell the answer.\r\n\r\nWhen I phoned General Sory Smith, his voice sounded a little peculiar.\r\n“I called Wright Field,” he said. “But they said you wouldn’t find\r\nanything of value out there.”\r\n\r\n“You mean they refused to let me see their files?”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn’t say that. But they’re short of personnel. They don’t want\r\nto take people off other jobs to look up the records.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t need any help,” I said. “Major Boggs said each case had a\r\nseparate book. If they’d just show me the shelves, I could do the job\r\nin two days.”\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n“I’ll ask them again,” the General said finally. “Call me sometime next\r\nweek.”\r\n\r\nI said I would, and hung up. The message from Wright Field hadn’t\r\nsurprised me. But Smith’s changed manner did. He had sounded oddly\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nWhile I was waiting for Wright Field’s answer, Ken Purdy phoned. He\r\ntold me that staff men from _Time_ and _Life_ magazines were seriously\r\nchecking on the “little men” story. Both Purdy and I were sure this was\r\na colossal hoax, but there was just a faint chance that someone had\r\nbeen on the fringe of a real happening and had made up the rest of the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nThey key man in the story seemed to be one George Koehler, of Denver,\r\nColorado. The morning after Purdy called, I took a plane to Denver.\r\nDuring the flight I went over the “little men” story again. It had been\r\nprinted in over a hundred papers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the usual version, George Koehler had accidentally learned\r\nof two crashed saucers at a radar station on our southwest border. The\r\nships were made of some strange metal. The cabin was stationary, placed\r\nwithin a large rotating ring.\r\n\r\nHere is the story as it was told in the _Kansas City Star_:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn flight, the ring revolved at a high rate of speed, while the cabin\r\nremained stationary like the center of a gyroscope.\r\n\r\nEach of the two ships seen by Koehler were occupied by a crew of two.\r\nIn the badly damaged ship, these bodies were charred so badly that\r\nlittle could be learned from them. The occupants of the other ship,\r\nwhile dead when they were found, were not burned or disfigured, and,\r\nwhen Koehler saw them, were in a perfect state of preservation. Medical\r\nreports, according to Koehler, showed that these men were almost\r\nidentical with earth-dwelling humans, except for a few minor\r\ndifferences. They were of a uniform height of three feet, were\r\nuniformly blond, beardless, and their teeth were completely free of\r\nfillings or cavities. They did not wear undergarments, but had their\r\nbodies taped.\r\n\r\nThe ships seemed to be magnetically controlled and powered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a piece of metal, Koehler had a clock or automatic\r\ncalendar taken from one of the crafts.\r\n\r\nKoehler said that the best assumption as to the source of the ships was\r\nthe planet Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at Denver, I went to the radio station where Koehler\r\nworked. I told him that if he had proof that we could print, we would\r\nbuy the story.\r\n\r\nAs the first substantial proof, I asked to see the piece of strange\r\nmetal he was supposed to have. Koehler said it had been sent to another\r\ncity to be analyzed. I asked to see pictures of the crashed saucers.\r\nThese, too, proved to be somewhere else. So did the queer “space clock”\r\nthat Koehler was said to have.\r\n\r\nBy this time I was sure it was all a gag. I had the feeling that\r\nKoehler, back of his manner of seeming indignation at my demands, was\r\nhugely enjoying himself. I cut the interview short and called Ken Purdy\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\n“Well, thank God that’s laid to rest,” he said when I told him.\r\n\r\nBut even though the “little men” story had turned out-as expected—a\r\ndud, Koehler had done me a good turn. An old friend, William E.\r\nBarrett, well-known fiction writer, now lived in Denver. Thanks to\r\nKoehler’s gag, I had a pleasant visit with Bill and his family.\r\n\r\nOn the trip back, I bought a paper at the Chicago airport. On an inside\r\npage I ran across Koehler’s name. According to the A.P., he had just\r\nadmitted the whole thing was a big joke.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of this, the “little men” story goes on and on. Apparently\r\nnot even Koehler can stop it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two weeks after my return to Washington, General Sory Smith held\r\noff a final answer about my trip to Wright Field. Meantime, Ken Purdy\r\nhad called him backing my request to see the Project files.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious to me that Wright Field was determined not to open the\r\nfiles. But the General was trying to avoid making it official.\r\n\r\n“Why can’t you accept my word there’s nothing to the saucers?” he asked\r\nme one day. “You’re impeaching my personal veracity.”\r\n\r\nBut finally he saw there was no other way out. He told me I had been\r\nofficially refused permission to see the Wright Field files. Some time\r\nlater, Ken Purdy phoned General Smith.\r\n\r\n“General, if the Air Force wants to talk to us off the record, we’ll\r\nplay ball. _True_ will either handle it from then on whatever way you\r\nthink best or we’ll keep still.”\r\n\r\nWhether this offer was relayed higher up, I don’t know. But nothing\r\ncame of it.\r\n\r\nMeantime, saucer reports had begun to come in from all over the\r\ncountry. Some even came from abroad. Some of these 1950 sightings have\r\nalready been mentioned in early chapters. Besides the strange affair at\r\nTucson on February 1, there were several other cases in February. Three\r\nof these were in South America. One saucer was reported near the naval\r\nair station at Alameda, California. Some were sighted in Texas, New\r\nMexico, and other parts of the Southwest.\r\n\r\nIn March, the wave of sightings reached such a height that the Air\r\nForce again denied the saucers’ existence. This followed a report that\r\na flying disk had crashed near Mexico City and that the wreckage had\r\nbeen viewed by U. S. Air Force officials.\r\n\r\nScores of Orangeburg, South Carolina, residents watched a disk that\r\nhovered over that city on March 10. It was described as silver-bright,\r\nturning slowly in the air before it disappeared. The day before this,\r\nresidents of Van Nuys, California, saw a bright disk moving swiftly\r\nfour hundred feet in the air. Seen through a telescope, it appeared to\r\nbe fifty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nDisks were reported at numerous places in Mexico, including\r\nGuadalajara, Juárez, Mazatlán, and Durango. On the twelfth of March,\r\nthe crew and passengers of an American Airlines ship saw a large\r\ngleaming disk high above Monterrey airport in Mexico.\r\n\r\nCaptain W. R. Hunt, the senior airline pilot, watched the disk through\r\na theodolite at the airport. This disk and most of the others seen in\r\nMexico were similar in description to the one sighted at Dayton, Ohio,\r\non March 8. This was the large metallic saucer that hovered high over\r\nVandalia Airport, until Air Force and National Guard fighters raced up\r\nafter it. The disk rose vertically into the sky at incredible speed,\r\nhovered a while longer, and then vanished.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours this mystery disk had been “identified” as the\r\nplanet Venus. (It was broad daylight.) Newspapers quoted “trained\r\nastronomical officials in Dayton” as the source for this explanation.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Mexican government newspaper, _El Nacional_, quoted “a\r\nfamous and reputable astronomer” as saying the numerous disks reported\r\nover Mexico “carry visitors from Mars.”\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest reports came from the naval air station at Dallas,\r\nTexas. It was about 11:30 A.M. on March 16 when CPO Charles Lewis saw a\r\ndisk streak up at a B-36 bomber. The disk appeared about twenty to\r\ntwenty-five feet in diameter, Lewis reported. Racing at incredible\r\nspeed, it shot up under the bomber, hung there for a second, then broke\r\naway at a 45-degree angle. Following this, it shot straight up into the\r\nair and disappeared.\r\n\r\nCaptain M. A. Nation, C. O. of the station, said it was “I the second\r\nreport in ten days. On March 7, said Captain Nation, a tower control\r\noperator named C. E. Edmundson saw a similar disk flying so fast it was\r\nalmost a blur.\r\n\r\n“He estimated its speed at three thousand to four thousand miles per\r\nhour,” Captain Nation stated. “Of course, he had no instruments to\r\ncompute the speed, so that’s a pure estimate.”\r\n\r\nIt was some time before this when I heard the first crazy rumor about\r\nthe guided-missile display. This story, which had new details every\r\ntime I heard it described the Air Force as refusing to let the Navy\r\nannounce a new type of missile. According to the rumors, the Air Force\r\nwas trying to prove its own missile far superior, to keep the Navy from\r\ninvading its long-range bombing domain. Then the Army joined the\r\npitched battle with still a third guided missile, according to the\r\nrumors.\r\n\r\nAnd the flying disks? Army, Navy, and Air Force missiles, launched in\r\ndroves all over the country to prove whose was the best? A public\r\nmissile race, with the joint Chiefs of Staff to decide the winner!\r\n\r\nIt seems fantastic that this theory would be believed by any\r\nintelligent person. In effect, it accuses the armed services of\r\ndeliberate, criminal negligence, of endangering millions in the cities\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that some of these rumors led to at least one of the\r\npublished guesses about our missile program. One widely publicized\r\nstory stated that the flying saucers seen hurtling through our skies\r\nare actually two types of secret weapons. One, according to radio and\r\nnewspaper accounts, is a disk that whizzes through space, halts\r\nsuspended in the air, soars to thirty thousand feet, drops to one\r\nthousand feet, and then usually disintegrates in the air.\r\n\r\nThese saucers, it was said, ranged from 20 inches to 250 feet in\r\ndiameter. They were supposed to be pilotless—and harmless.\r\n\r\nThe second type was said to be a jet version of the Navy’s circular\r\nairfoil “Flying Flapjack.” It was credited with fantastic speed.\r\n\r\nThe “true disks,” however, were mainly Air Force devices, according to\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\n“Some are guided, others are not,” said the radio commentator who\r\nreleased this story. “They can stay stationary, dash off to right or\r\nleft, and move like lightning. But they are utterly harmless.”\r\n\r\nIn these “harmless” disks there was supposed to be an explosive charge\r\nthat destroyed them in mid-air at a predetermined time.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after this story was broadcast, the _United States\r\nNews and World Report_ declared that the saucers are real, and\r\nidentified them as jet models of Navy “Flying Flapjacks.” This\r\nmagazine, which is not an official publication despite its name,\r\nmentioned the variable-direction jet principle that I had previously\r\ndescribed in the True article.\r\n\r\nThese two flying-saucer “explanations” brought denials from the White\r\nHouse, the Navy, and the Air Force.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force flatly declared that:\r\n\r\n1. None of the armed forces is conducting secret experiments with\r\ndisk-shaped flying objects that could be a basis for the reported\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n2. There is no evidence that the latter stem from the activities of any\r\nforeign nation.\r\n\r\nBefore this, President Truman stated he knew nothing of any such\r\nobjects being developed by the United States or any other nation.\r\n\r\nThe Navy denial came immediately after the first broadcast story. It\r\nran:\r\n\r\n“The Navy is not engaged in research or in flying any jet-powered,\r\ncircular-shaped aircraft.”\r\n\r\nThe Navy added that one model of a pancake-shaped aircraft, called the\r\nZimmerman Skimmer, was built but was never flown. However, a small,\r\nthree-thousand-pound scale model did fly and was under radio control\r\nduring flight. This last device is now being rumored as the Navy’s\r\nunpiloted “missile,” said to have been launched over the country like\r\nthe so-called “harmless” disks.\r\n\r\nEven though all these accounts have been officially denied, many\r\nAmericans may still believe they are true. I have no desire to\r\ncriticize the authors of these stories; I believe that in following up\r\ncertain guided-missile leads they were misled into accepting the\r\nconclusions they gave.\r\n\r\nBut these stories, particularly the accounts of huge unpiloted disks,\r\nmay have planted certain fears in the public mind-fears that are\r\ncompletely unwarranted. For this reason, I have personally checked at\r\nWashington in regard to the dangers of unpiloted missiles. Here aye the\r\nfacts I learned:\r\n\r\n1. Neither the Army, Navy, nor Air Force has at any time staged any\r\nguided-missile competition as rumored.\r\n\r\n2. No unpiloted missiles or remote-controlled experimental craft have\r\nbeen tested over American cities or heavily populated areas.\r\n\r\n3. No unpiloted missile carrying dangerous explosives, whether for\r\ndestruction of the device or other purposes, has been deliberately\r\nlaunched or tested over heavily populated areas.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the so-called jet-propelled “Flying Flapjack,” I have been\r\nassured by Admiral Calvin Bolster, of the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics,\r\nthat this type of plane has never been produced. I concede that he\r\nmight make this statement to conceal a secret development, but there is\r\none fact of which every American can be certain: Neither this type, nor\r\nthe radio-controlled smaller model, has been or will be flown or\r\nlaunched over areas where people would be endangered.\r\n\r\nThe three armed services are working on guided missiles. They are not\r\nrisking American lives by launching such missiles at random across the\r\nUnited States,\r\n\r\nAlthough most of our guided-missile projects are secret, it is possible\r\nto give certain facts about guided-missile developments in general.\r\n\r\nThe first successful long-range missiles were produced by the Germans.\r\nThese were the buzz-bomb and. the V-2 rocket. But research in various\r\nother types was carried on during the war. Some of this was with oval\r\nand round types of airfoils. As already stated by Paul Redell, there is\r\nstrong evidence that the disk-shaped foil resulted from German\r\nobservations of either space ships or remote-control disk-shaped\r\n“observer units.” All the Nazi space-exploration plans followed this\r\ndiscovery that we were being observed by a race from another planet.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of World War II, the international guided-missile race\r\nbegan, with the British, Russians, and ourselves as the chief\r\ncontenders. Numerous types have been developed-winged bombs, small\r\nradar-guided projectiles launched from planes, and ground-to-plane\r\nplane-to-ground, and plane-to-plane missiles, equipped with target\r\nhoming devices.\r\n\r\nIn certain recent types, the range can be stated as several hundred\r\nmiles. So far as I have learned, after weeks of rechecking this point,\r\nnot a single long-range missile has been identified as Russian.\r\n\r\nSince this country is working closely with Great Britain on global\r\ndefense problems, it is no violation of security to say that we have\r\nprobably exchanged certain guided-missile information. In regard to the\r\nBritish long-range missile picture outlined to me by John Steele, I can\r\nstate two major facts:\r\n\r\n1. The British have categorically denied testing such long-range\r\nmissiles over American territory, where they might endanger American\r\ncitizens. There is convincing evidence that they are telling the truth.\r\n\r\n2. There is no British missile now built, or planned, that could\r\nexplain the objects seen by Captain Mantell, Chiles and Whitted, and\r\nwitnesses in most of the major sightings.\r\n\r\nThe preceding statement applies equally to American-built missiles.\r\nThere is no experimental craft or guided missile even remotely\r\nconsidered in this country that would begin to approach the dimensions\r\nand performance of the space ships seen in these cases.\r\n\r\nThere is concrete evidence that the United States is as well advanced\r\nas any other nation in guided-missile development. Certain recent\r\nadvances should place us in the lead, unless confidential reports on\r\nSoviet progress are completely wrong.\r\n\r\nIf American scientists and engineers can learn the source of the space\r\nships’ power and adapt it to our use, it may well be the means for\r\nending the threat of war. The Soviet scientists are well aware of this;\r\ntheir research into cosmic rays and other natural forces has been\r\nredoubled since the flying-saucer reports of 1947.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the space ships’ power is more important than even the\r\nhydrogen bomb. It may someday be the key to the fate of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter one year’s investigation of the flying saucers and Air Force\r\noperations, I have come to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n1. The Air Force was puzzled, and badly worried when the disks first\r\nwere sighted in 1947.\r\n\r\n2. The Air Force began to suspect the truth soon after Mantell’s\r\ndeath—perhaps even before.\r\n\r\n3. Project “Saucer” was set up to investigate and at the same time\r\nconceal from the public the truth about the saucers.\r\n\r\n4. During the spring of 1949 this policy, which had been strictly\r\nmaintained by Forrestal, underwent an abrupt change. On top-level\r\norders, it was decided to let the facts gradually leak out, in order to\r\nprepare the American people.\r\n\r\n5. This was the reason for the April 27, 1949, report, with its\r\nsuggestions about space visitors.\r\n\r\n6. While I was preparing the article for the January 1950 issue of\r\n_True_, it had been considered in line with the general education\r\nprogram. But the unexpected public reaction was mistaken by the Air\r\nForce for hysteria, resulting in their hasty denial that the saucers\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\n7. Because the Air Force feared any closer analysis of the Mantell\r\ncase, Major Boggs was instructed to publicize the Venus explanation.\r\nAlthough it had been denied, the Air Force knew that most people had\r\nforgotten this or had never known it.\r\n\r\n8. Major Boggs, having stated this answer publicly (along with the\r\nother Chiles-Whitted and Gorman answers), was forced to stick to it,\r\nthough he knew it was wrong and that the case summaries would prove it.\r\n\r\n9. The case summaries were released to a small number of Washington\r\nnewsmen, to continue planting the space-travel thought; this decision\r\nbeing made after _True’s_ reception proved to the Air Force that the\r\npublic was better prepared than had been thought.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the flying saucers themselves, I believe that in the\r\nmajority of cases, space ships are the answer:\r\n\r\n1. The earth has been under periodic observation from another planet,\r\nor other planets, for at least two centuries.\r\n\r\n2. This observation suddenly increased in 1947, following, the series\r\nof A-bomb explosions begun in 1945.\r\n\r\n3. The observation, now intermittent, is part of a long-range survey\r\nand will continue indefinitely. No immediate attempt to contact the\r\nearth seems evident. There may be some unknown block to making contact,\r\nbut it is more probable that the spacemen’s plans are not complete.\r\n\r\nI believe that the Air Force is still investigating the saucer\r\nsightings, either through the Air Materiel Command or some other\r\nheadquarters. It is possible that some Air Force officials still fear a\r\npanic when the truth is officially revealed. In that case, we may\r\ncontinue for a long time to see routine denials alternating with new\r\nsuggestions of interplanetary travel.\r\n\r\nThe education problem is complicated by two imperative needs. We must\r\ntry to learn as much as we can about the space ships’ source of power,\r\nand at the same time try to prevent clues to this information from\r\nreaching an enemy on earth,\r\n\r\nIf censorship is suddenly imposed on all flying-saucer reports, this\r\nwill be the chief reason. This would also help solve a minor problem\r\nwhere partial censorship now exists. A few test missiles launched from\r\na southwest base have been seen by citizens at a distance from the\r\nproving grounds. In some cases, their reports have got into local\r\npapers, though the wire services did not carry them.\r\n\r\nThese missile tests are peculiarly different from the general run of\r\nflying-saucer reports. Contrasted with the Chiles-Whitted, Mantell, and\r\nother space-ship sightings, they stand out with a certain pattern, easy\r\nto recognize. News or radio reports of these tests might accidentally\r\ngive an enemy clues to the type, speed, and range of this particular\r\nmissile, once he learned the pattern. Periodic censorship, or even a\r\ncomplete blackout of sighting reports, may be enforced during the next\r\nyear or so.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes mentioned, such action would be justified. But\r\nwhenever such censorship is lifted, the complete truth about space\r\nvisitors should be told at the same time: the full details of all the\r\nmajor cases, the size of the Godman Field space ship, any attempted\r\nlandings or other efforts at contact by interplanetary visitors, and\r\nall other details that now are official secrets.\r\n\r\nI also believe that a certain group of disk sightings in this country\r\nis linked with our guided missiles. Official announcements, of course,\r\nmay be delayed a long time. With this exception, I believe that\r\nAmericans should be told the truth, now.\r\n\r\nWhen the announcement of our guided missiles is made, some Americans\r\nnot familiar with the facts may accept it as a full answer. If\r\nofficials are not yet ready to reveal the space-travel facts, the\r\nMantell evidence and other key cases may be deliberately glossed over.\r\n\r\nBut even if all the evidence—the world-wide sightings, the old records,\r\nthe Chiles-Whitted and other cases—should be completely ignored,\r\nAmericans cannot escape eventual contact with dwellers on other\r\nplanets. Even though space visitors never attempt contact with us,\r\nsooner or later earthlings will be traveling to distant planets—planets\r\nthat scientists have said are almost surely inhabited.\r\n\r\nThe American people have proved their ability to take incredible\r\nthings. We have survived the stunning impact of the Atomic Age. We\r\nshould be able to take the Interplanetary Age, when it comes, without\r\nhysteria.",
