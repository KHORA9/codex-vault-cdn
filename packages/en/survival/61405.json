We took our places\r\nin the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that\r\nnobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling\r\nlost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to\r\nme. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An\r\nintelligent runt like me.\r\n\r\nHe said what I expected. \"Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get\r\ntogether when we get down?\"\r\n\r\nI guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked\r\nhim. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crack\r\nhe'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, \"Not likely. I want to\r\ncome back alive.\" It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he went\r\nback to his place without saying anything.\r\n\r\nMy name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't be\r\ntelling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect that\r\nscrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the\r\nmeantime, I've got brains as a consolation.\r\n\r\nAfter we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.\r\nWe sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and\r\nthen we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have to\r\nleave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.\r\n\r\nThinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He's\r\nthe only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't go\r\npartners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that\r\ncrack about being a snob.\r\n\r\nThe planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact\r\nthe Ship had had with it--and we were the ones who dropped them--was\r\nalmost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council\r\ndebate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was\r\nall right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to us\r\nkids because they never tell you anything about the place they're going\r\nto drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that much\r\nif Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.\r\n\r\nI felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody\r\nelse was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried when\r\nI said good-by to Mother and Daddy--a real emotional scene--but that\r\nwasn't in public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,\r\nbecause I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me\r\nunhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.\r\nPlanets make me feel wretched.\r\n\r\nThe gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and\r\ncalves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on\r\na piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere\r\nand little grubby things just looking for _you_ to crawl on. If you\r\ncan think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty\r\nimagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells--I've\r\nbeen on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but\r\nnot for me.\r\n\r\nWe have a place in the Ship like that--the Third Level--but it's only a\r\nthousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up\r\na level or down a level and be back in civilization.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the\r\nsea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested\r\nhills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They\r\ndon't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his\r\ngear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still\r\nsmarting from the slap I'd given him.\r\n\r\nIn a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see\r\nJimmy--if he would get back alive.\r\n\r\nIt's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the\r\nnearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound\r\nlike fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.\r\n\r\nDon't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow\r\nfor fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They\r\ndo figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time\r\nyou're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to\r\nthe Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship\r\nis a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that\r\nsomething has to be done in a closed society to keep the population\r\nfrom decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to\r\nkeep the population steady.\r\n\r\nI began to check my gear out--sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be\r\nfound at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.\r\nVenie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start\r\ngetting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next\r\nlanding, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't\r\nhave anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the\r\nbad moment any longer.\r\n\r\nThe ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,\r\nand in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the\r\ncolor of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThe first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the\r\nlights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in\r\nthe dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach\r\nif it's really going to come back. But I lived through it--one day in\r\nthirty gone.\r\n\r\nI rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three\r\nthings in mind--stay alive, find people and find some of the others.\r\nThe first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot\r\nI could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to\r\ncamp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,\r\nthough not with that meatball Jimmy D.\r\n\r\nNo, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take\r\nnothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from\r\nnobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.\r\n\r\nI had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November--too close to\r\nYear End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was\r\nspring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got\r\nback we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to\r\nlook forward to.\r\n\r\nIn two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking\r\nanimals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty\r\ngood, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the\r\nbest meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I\r\nwondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and\r\nthey've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good\r\nthat I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the\r\nhillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching\r\nit in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a\r\nhard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks\r\nof horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't\r\nidentify.\r\n\r\nOne of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when\r\nthey dropped the colonies. I say \"they\" because, while we did the\r\nactual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on\r\nEarth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were\r\nestablished, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have\r\ndraft animals.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,\r\nas well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything\r\nelse in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies\r\nwere planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that\r\n_could_ have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have\r\nhad to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll\r\nbet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe'd come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the\r\nroad. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.\r\n\r\nI came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined\r\nbend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There\r\nwere five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nThey were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and\r\nknobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for\r\nfaces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were\r\nalmost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They\r\nmade a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nI started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the\r\nmen on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as\r\ncats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line\r\nand he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That\r\none wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.\r\n\r\nHe was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he\r\nhad a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we\r\nreached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow\r\nme. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the\r\nface he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man\r\nlooks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That\r\nwas why I kept riding.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head?\r\nThere be escaped Losels in these woods.\"\r\n\r\nI told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it\r\nwas that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though.\r\nGenerally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say\r\nanything. It seemed smart.\r\n\r\n\"Where be you from?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI pointed to the road behind us.\r\n\r\n\"And where be you going?\"\r\n\r\nI pointed ahead. No other way to go.\r\n\r\nHe seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and\r\nDaddy, who should know better.\r\n\r\nWe were coming up on the others now, and the man said, \"Maybe you'd\r\nbetter ride on from here with us. For protection.\"\r\n\r\nHe had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a\r\nmouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether\r\neverybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International\r\nEnglish spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nOne of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they'd been\r\nwatching us all the while. He called to the hard man.\r\n\r\n\"He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at\r\nall. We mought as well throw him back again.\"\r\n\r\nThe rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he\r\nexpected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.\r\n\r\nThe hard man said to the others, \"This boy will be riding along with us\r\nto Forton for protection.\"\r\n\r\nI looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving\r\nalong and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes.\r\nI felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nI said, \"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\nWhat the man did then surprised me. He said, \"I do think so,\" and\r\nreached for the rifle in his saddle boot.\r\n\r\nI whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over\r\nwith the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he\r\ndidn't want to be fried.\r\n\r\nI said, \"Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThey did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.\r\n\r\nWhen all the rifles were on the ground, I said, \"All right, let's go.\"\r\n\r\nThey didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I\r\ncould see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with\r\nnarrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling\r\ntones said, \"Look here, kid....\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up,\" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It\r\nsurprised me. I didn't think I sounded _that_ mean. I decided he just\r\ndidn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the\r\ncreatures, I said, \"If you want your rifles, you can go back and get\r\nthem now.\" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next\r\nbend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and\r\nthe creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.\r\n\r\nI put this episode in the \"file and hold for analysis\" section in my\r\nmind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes\r\nI even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nWhen I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my\r\ngreat-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it,\r\nnestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than\r\nthe last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.\r\n\r\nMy face must have been like that as I rode along the road.\r\n\r\nThe country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave\r\nway to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of\r\nthe green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before\r\nhadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.\r\n\r\nBut it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nI passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody\r\nquestioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving\r\nsilently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've\r\nseen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received\r\na jolt that sickened me.\r\n\r\nBy the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were\r\ncold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to\r\na gallop.\r\n\r\nI rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all\r\nstone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were\r\nno machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the\r\nedge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the\r\nwindow--INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.\r\n\r\nBut I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't\r\nsee one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There\r\nwere little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All\r\nthe boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why\r\nHorst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but\r\nI decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the\r\nclocks tick on this planet.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They\r\nswarmed. I saw a family come out of a house--a father and _four_\r\nchildren. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me\r\nthen--these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I\r\nclosed my eyes until it passed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first thing you learn in school is that if it weren't for idiot and\r\ncriminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The\r\nevacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people\r\nwouldn't have died. There wouldn't have _been_ eight billion people.\r\nBut, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in\r\ntheir path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth\r\nhad and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.\r\n\r\nI am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough\r\nforesight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some\r\nothers like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I\r\nwouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.\r\n\r\nWhat happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up\r\nblowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The\r\nolder people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the\r\nCouncil should know.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt _really_\r\nfrightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I\r\nfelt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I\r\nwhomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.\r\n\r\nI let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk\r\nagain. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's\r\nsmart and brains I needed.\r\n\r\nHow do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method.\r\nFor one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you\r\nwant to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody?\r\nWho? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind\r\nup with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think\r\nof was to find a library, but that might be a job.\r\n\r\nI'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the\r\nlate afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was\r\nstarting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the\r\nsky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what\r\nhad gone wrong.\r\n\r\nI reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal.\r\nThe scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to\r\ndrop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I\r\ntriggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't\r\nknow why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.\r\n\r\nThe ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my\r\nhead, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started\r\nbucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain\r\nidiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me\r\noverhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours.\r\nNot too different, but not ours.\r\n\r\nOne more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and\r\nwe wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that\r\ntakes an advanced technology to build.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to\r\na campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't\r\nhelp but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent\r\nbuildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more\r\nthan a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof.\r\n\r\nI set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man,\r\nhis wife and their three children. The kids were running around and\r\nplaying, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father\r\ncame and pulled him away.\r\n\r\nThe kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said\r\nhello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I\r\nhad two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until\r\nthat moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these\r\nkids. Isn't that horrible?\r\n\r\nAbout the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man\r\nI had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He\r\nhad white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never\r\nseen before.\r\n\r\nWhen nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered\r\naround. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the\r\nchildren tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go,\r\nso the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd\r\naccent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness,\r\nit seemed just right.\r\n\r\nIt was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in\r\na house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a\r\nnice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony\r\nerrand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the\r\npoor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the\r\nhandkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her\r\ndear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to\r\ndefeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.\r\n\r\nI wished for the same for myself.\r\n\r\nThe old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids\r\noff to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the\r\ncamp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I\r\ncouldn't see far into the dark.\r\n\r\nA voice there said, \"I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this\r\none, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nHorst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the\r\ncampfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the\r\nfire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets\r\nand mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now\r\nwhat they used the high-walled pen for.\r\n\r\nI should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the\r\nnight. I should have used my head. I hadn't and now it was time to take\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nI never got the chance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI was just heaving the saddle up on Ninc when I felt a hand on my\r\nshoulder and I was swung around.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well. Horst, look who we have here,\" he called. It was the one\r\nwho'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He\r\nwas alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.\r\n\r\nI brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he\r\nwent down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him\r\nand reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from\r\nbehind and pinned my arms to my side.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth to scream--I have a good scream--but a rough smelly\r\nhand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a\r\nlungful of air. I bit down hard--5000 lbs. psi, I'm told--but he\r\ndidn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet\r\nand dragged me off.\r\n\r\nWhen we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped\r\ndragging me and dropped me in a heap. \"Make any noise,\" he said, \"and\r\nI'll hurt you.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'd\r\nthreatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things\r\nto do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight\r\nfor that. \"I ought to club you anyway,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting\r\nthe animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said. \"Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what\r\nwe can use.\"\r\n\r\nThe other one didn't move. \"Get going, Jack,\" Horst said in a menacing\r\ntone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally\r\nbacked down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me\r\nbeing kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his\r\nbunch.\r\n\r\nBut I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under\r\nmy jacket.\r\n\r\nHorst turned back to me and I said, \"You can't do this and get away\r\nwith it.\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of\r\ntrouble. So don't give me a hard time.\"\r\n\r\nHe still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I\r\ndidn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.\r\n\r\n\"The courts won't let you get away with this,\" I said. I'd passed\r\na courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL\r\nJUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or\r\nsomething stuffy like that.\r\n\r\nHe laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I\r\nknew I'd goofed.\r\n\r\n\"Boy, boy. Don't talk about the courts. I be doing you a favor. I be\r\ntaking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go to\r\ncourt and they'll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leaving\r\nyou your freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would they be doing that?\" I asked. I slipped my hand under my\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n\"Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the\r\nShips,\" Horst said. \"That be enough. They already have one of you brats\r\nin jail in Forton.\"\r\n\r\nI was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, with\r\nall my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"The kid's got some good equipment. But I can't make out what\r\nthis be for.\" He held out my pickup signal.\r\n\r\nHorst looked at it, then handed it back. \"Throw it away,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI leveled my gun at them--Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, \"Hand\r\nthat over to me.\"\r\n\r\nHorst made a disgusted sound.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make any noise,\" I said, \"or you'll fry. Now hand it over.\"\r\n\r\nI stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the\r\nsaddle. \"What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't remember,\" he said. \"But it be coming to me. Hold on.\"\r\n\r\nI waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind\r\nand the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, \"Good\r\nenough,\" to the others who'd come up behind me.\r\n\r\nI felt like a fool.\r\n\r\nHorst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and\r\nsaid in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was\r\nnatural and mine wasn't, \"The piece be yours.\" Then he tromped on it\r\nuntil it cracked and fell apart.\r\n\r\nThen he said, \"Pull a gun on me twice. Twice.\" He slapped me so hard\r\nthat my ears rang. \"You dirty little punk.\"\r\n\r\nI said calmly, \"You big louse.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I can\r\nremember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of my\r\nface and then nothing.\r\n\r\nBrains are no good if you don't use them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nI remember pain and sickness, and motion, but my next clear memory is\r\nwaking in a bed in a house. I had a feeling that time had passed but\r\nhow much I didn't know. I looked around and found the old man who had\r\ntold the story sitting by my bed.\r\n\r\n\"How be you feeling this morning, young lady?\" he asked. He had white\r\nhair and a seamed face and his hands were gnarled and old. His face was\r\nred, and the red and the white of his hair made a sharp contrast with\r\nthe bright blue of his deep-set eyes. It was a good face.\r\n\r\n\"Not very healthy,\" I said. \"How long has it been?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two days,\" he said. \"You'll get over it soon enough. I be Daniel\r\nKutsov. And you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm Mia Havero.\"\r\n\r\n\"I found you dumped in a ditch after Horst Fanger and his boys had left\r\nyou,\" he said. \"A very unpleasant man ... as I suppose he be bound to\r\nbe, herding Losels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those green things were Losels? Why are they afraid of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"The ones you saw beed drugged. They wouldn't obey otherwise. Once in\r\nawhile a few be stronger than the drug and they escape to the woods.\r\nThe drug cannot be so strong that they cannot work. So the strongest\r\nescape. They be some danger to most people, and a great danger to men\r\nlike Horst Fanger who buy them from the ships. Every so often, hunters\r\ngo out to thin them down.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems like slavery,\" I said, yawning.\r\n\r\nIt was a stupid thing to say, like some comment about the idiocy of a\r\nFree Birth policy. Not the sentiment, but the timing.\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov treated the comment with more respect than it deserved.\r\n\"Only God can decide a question like that,\" he said gently. \"Be it\r\nslavery to use my horses to work for me? I don't know anyone who would\r\nsay so. A man be a different matter, though. The question be whether a\r\nLosel be like a horse or like a man, and that I can't answer. Now go to\r\nsleep again and in a while I will bring you some food.\"\r\n\r\nHe left then, but I didn't go to sleep. I was in trouble. I had no way\r\nto contact the scoutship. There was only one way out, and that was to\r\nfind somebody else who did have his signal. That wasn't going to be\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov brought me some food later in the day, and I asked him then,\r\n\"Why are you doing all this for me?\"\r\n\r\nHe said, \"I don't like to see children hurt, by people like Horst\r\nFanger or by anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I'm from one of the Ships,\" I said. \"You know that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov nodded. \"Yes, I know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that is pretty bad around here.\"\r\n\r\n\"With some people, true. But all the people who hate the Ships don't\r\nrealize that if it beedn't for the Ships they wouldn't be here at all.\r\nThey hold their grudge too close to their hearts. There be some of us\r\nwho disagree with the government though it has lost us our families or\r\nyears from our lives, and we would not destroy what we cannot agree\r\nwith. When such an one as Horst Fanger uses this as an excuse to rob\r\nand injure a child, I will not agree. He has taken all that you have\r\nand there is no way to reclaim it, but what I can give of my house be\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI thanked him as best I could and then I asked him what the grudge was\r\nthat they held against the Ships.\r\n\r\n\"It ben't a simple thing,\" he said. \"You have seen how poor and\r\nbackward we be. We realize it. Now and again, when you decide to stop,\r\nwe see you people from the Ships. And you ben't poor or backward. You\r\ncould call what we feel jealousy, if you wanted, but it be more than\r\nthat and different. When we beed dropped here, there beed no scientists\r\nor technicians among us. I can understand. Why should they leave the\r\nlast places where they had a chance to use and develop their knowledge\r\nfor a backward planet where there is no equipment, no opportunity? What\r\nbe felt here be that all the men who survived the end of Earth and the\r\nSolar System be the equal heirs of man's knowledge and accomplishment.\r\nBut by bad luck, things didn't work out that way. So ideas urged by the\r\nShips be ignored, and the Ships be despised, and people from the Ships\r\nbe treated as shamefully as you have beed or worse.\"\r\n\r\nI could think of a good example of an idea that the Ships emphasized\r\nthat had been ignored. Only it was more than an idea or an opinion. It\r\nwas a cold and deadly lesson taught by history. It was: Man becomes an\r\norganism that ultimately destroys itself unless he regulates his own\r\nsize and growth. That was what I was taught.\r\n\r\nI said, \"I can understand how they might feel that way, but it's not\r\nfair. We pretty much support ourselves. As much as we can, we re-use\r\nthings and salvage things, but we still need raw materials. The only\r\nthing we have to trade is knowledge. If we didn't have anything to\r\ntrade for raw materials, that would be the end of us. Do we have a\r\nchoice?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't hold you to blame,\" Mr. Kutsov said slowly, \"but I can't help\r\nbut to feel that you have made a mistake and that it will hurt you in\r\nthe end.\"\r\n\r\nI didn't say it, but I thought--when you lay blame, whom do you put it\r\non? People who are obviously sick like these Mud-eaters, or people who\r\nare normal like us?\r\n\r\nAfter I got better, I had the run of Mr. Kutsov's house. It was a small\r\nplace near the edge of Forton, surrounded by trees and with a small\r\ngarden. Mr. Kutsov made a regular shipping run through the towns to the\r\ncoast and back every second week. It was not a profitable business, but\r\nhe said that at his age, profit was no longer very important. He was\r\nvery good to me, but I didn't understand him.\r\n\r\nHe gave me lessons before he let me go outside into the town. Women\r\nwere second class citizens around here, but prejudice of that sort\r\nwasn't in Mr. Kutsov. Dressed as I was, as scrawny as I am, when people\r\nsaw me here, they saw a boy. People see what they expect to see. I\r\ncould get away with my sex, but not my accent. I might sound right\r\non seven Ships and on all other planets, but here I was wrong. And\r\nI had two choices--sound right or shut up. One of these choices was\r\nimpossible for me, so I set out to learn to sound like a Tinteran,\r\nborn and bred, with Mr. Kutsov's aid.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before he was willing to give me a barely passing\r\ngrade. He said, \"All right. You should keep listening to people and\r\ncorrecting yourself, but I be satisfied. You talk as though you have a\r\nrag in your mouth, but I think you can get by.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I went out into town, I found out one more important thing. It\r\nwas the answer to a question that I didn't ask Mr. Kutsov. I'd been\r\nsearching for it in old newspapers, and at last I found the story I was\r\nlooking for. The last sentence read: \"After sentencing, Dentremont was\r\nsent to the Territorial Jail in Forton to serve his three-month term.\"\r\n\r\nI thought, they misspelled his name. And then I thought, trust it to be\r\nJimmy D. He gets in almost as much trouble as I do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThough you may think it strange, my first stop was the library. I've\r\nfound that it helps to be well-researched. I got what I could from Mr.\r\nKutsov's books during the first days while he was outdoors working in\r\nhis garden. In his library, I found a novel that he had written himself\r\ncalled _The White Way_.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"It took me forty years to write it, and I have spent\r\nforty-two years since living with the political repercussions. It has\r\nbeed an interesting forty-two years, but I am not sure that I would do\r\nit again. Read the book if you be interested.\"\r\n\r\nI did read it, though I couldn't understand what the fuss was about.\r\nIt seemed reasonable to me. But these Mud-eaters were crazy anyway. I\r\ncouldn't help but think that he and Daddy would have found a lot in\r\ncommon. They were both fine, tough-minded people, and though you would\r\nnever know it to look at them, they were the same age. Except that at\r\nthe age of eighty Mr. Kutsov was old, and at the age of eighty Daddy\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\nIt cost me an effort to walk through the streets of Forton, but after\r\nmy third trip, the pain was less, though the number of children still\r\nmade me sick.\r\n\r\nIn the library, I spent four days getting a line on Tintera. I read\r\ntheir history. I studied their geography and, as sneakily as I could, I\r\ntore out the best local maps I could find.\r\n\r\nOn my trips through town, I took the time to look up Horst Fanger's\r\nplace of business. It was a house, a shed and pen for the Losels, a\r\nstable, a truck garage (one truck--broken down) and a sale block,\r\nall housed in one rambling, shanty building. Mr. Horst Fanger was\r\napparently a big man. Big deal.\r\n\r\nWhen I was ready, I scouted out the jail. It was a raw unpleasant day,\r\nthe sort that makes me hate planets, and rain was threatening when I\r\nreached the jailpen. It was a solid three-story building of great stone\r\nblocks, shaped like a fortress and protected by bars, an iron-spike\r\nfence and two nasty-looking dogs. On my second trip around, the rain\r\nbegan. I beat it to the front and dodged in the entrance.\r\n\r\nI was standing there, shaking the rain off, when a man in a green\r\nuniform came stalking out of one of the offices that lined the\r\nfirst-floor hallway. My heart stopped for a moment, but he went right\r\nby without giving me a second look and went upstairs. That gave me some\r\nconfidence and so I started poking around.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had covered the bulletin boards and the offices on one side of the\r\nhall when another man in green came into the hall and made straight for\r\nme. I didn't wait, I walked toward him, too. I said, as wide-eyed and\r\ninnocent as I could, \"Can you help me, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that depends. What sort of help do you need?\" He was a big,\r\nrather slow man with one angled cloth bar on his shirt front over one\r\npocket and a plate that said ROBARDS pinned over the pocket on the\r\nother side. He seemed good-natured.\r\n\r\nI said, \"Jerry had to write about the capital, and Jimmy got the\r\nGovernor, and I got _you_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on there. First, what be your name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Billy Davidow,\" I said. \"I don't know what to write, sir, and I\r\nthought you could show me around and tell me things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I be sorry, son,\" he said. \"We be pretty caught up today. Could you\r\nmake it some other afternoon or maybe some evening?\"\r\n\r\nI said slowly, \"I have to hand the paper in this week.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a minute, he said, \"All right. I'll take you around. But I can't\r\nspare much time. It'll have to be a quick tour.\"\r\n\r\nThe offices were on the first floor. Storage rooms, an arms room and a\r\ntarget range were in the basement. Most of the cells were on the second\r\nfloor, with the very rough cases celled on the third.\r\n\r\n\"If the judge says maximum security, they go on the third, everybody\r\nelse on the second unless we have an overflow. Have a boy upstairs now.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart sank.\r\n\r\n\"A real bad actor. Killed a man.\"\r\n\r\nWell, that wasn't Jimmy. Not with a three-month sentence.\r\n\r\nMaximum security had three sets of barred doors plus an armed guard.\r\nSgt. Robards pointed it all out to me. \"By this time next week, it\r\nwill all be full in here,\" he said sadly. \"The Governor has ordered a\r\nround-up of all political agitators. The Anti-Redemptionists be getting\r\nout of hand and he be going to cool them off. Uh, don't put that in\r\nyour paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I won't,\" I said, crossing off on my notes.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary cells on the second floor were behind no barred doors and\r\nI got a guided tour. I stared Jimmy D. right in the face, but he had\r\nthe brains to keep his mouth shut.\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished, I thanked Sgt. Robards enthusiastically. \"It sure\r\nhas been swell, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, son,\" he said. \"I enjoyed it myself. If you have time some\r\nevening, drop by when I have the duty. My schedule bees on the bulletin\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I said. \"Maybe I will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nBefore I scouted the jail I had only vague notions of what I was going\r\nto do to spring Jimmy D. I had spent an hour or so, for instance,\r\ntoying with the idea of forcing the Territorial Governor to release\r\nJimmy at the point of a gun. I spent that much time with it because the\r\nidea was fun to think about, but I dropped it because it was stupid.\r\n\r\nI finally decided on a very simple course of action, one that could\r\neasily go wrong. It was my choice because it was the only thing I could\r\npull off by myself that had a chance of working.\r\n\r\nBefore I left the jail building, I copied down Sgt. Robards' duty\r\nschedule from the bulletin board. Then I went home.\r\n\r\nI spent the next few days shoplifting. Mr. Kutsov was laying in\r\nsupplies, too, loading his wagon for his regular trip. I helped him\r\nload up, saving my shopping for my spare time. Mr. Kutsov wanted me to\r\ngo along with him, but I couldn't, of course, and I couldn't tell him\r\nwhy. He didn't want to argue and he couldn't _make_ me do anything I\r\ndidn't want to do, so I had an unfair advantage. I just dug in my heels.\r\n\r\nFinally he agreed it was all right for me to stay alone in the house\r\nwhile he was gone. It was what I wanted, but I didn't enjoy the process\r\nof getting my own way as much as I did at home. There it is a more\r\neven battle.\r\n\r\nThe day he picked to leave was perfect for my purposes. Mr. Kutsov\r\nsaid, \"I'll be back in six days. Be you sure that you will be all\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Yes. I'll be careful. You be careful, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it matters much any more at my age,\" he smiled. \"Stay\r\nout of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" I said, and waved good-by. That was what I meant to do,\r\nstay out of trouble.\r\n\r\nBack in the house, I wrote a note of explanation for Mr. Kutsov and\r\nthanked him for all he had done. Then I dug my two small packs out of\r\nhiding and I was ready.\r\n\r\nI set out just after dark. It was sprinkling lightly, but I didn't mind\r\nit. It surprised me, but I enjoyed the feel of the spray on my face. In\r\none pocket I had pencil and paper for protective coverage. In another\r\npocket I had a single sock and a roll of tape.\r\n\r\nJust before I got to the jail, I filled the sock with wet sand.\r\n\r\nInside there were lights on in only two first floor offices. Sgt.\r\nRobards was in one of them.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Sgt. Robards,\" I said, going in. \"How be you tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well enough,\" he said. \"It be pretty slow down here tonight. They be\r\nbusy up on the Third Floor tonight, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh?\"\r\n\r\n\"They be picking up those Anti-Redemptionists tonight. How did your\r\npaper go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I handed it in,\" I said. \"I should get a good grade with your help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you found out everything you needed to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. I just came by to visit tonight. I wondered if you'd show me\r\nthe target range again. That was keen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said. \"Would you like to see me pop some targets? I be the\r\nlocal champion, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gee, would you?\"\r\n\r\nWe went downstairs, Sgt. Robards leading the way. This was the place\r\nI'd picked to drop him. He was about to slip the key in the door to the\r\nrange when I slugged him across the back of the neck with my sock full\r\nof sand. I grabbed him and eased him down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI tried the keys on either side of the target door key and opened the\r\narsenal on the second try. I dragged him in there and got out my roll\r\nof tape I took three quick turns about his ankles, then did the same\r\nwith his wrists. I finished by putting a bar and two crosspieces over\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\nI picked out two weapons then. They had no sonics, of course, so I\r\npicked out two of the smallest and lightest pistols in the room.\r\nI figured out what cartridges fit them, and then dropped guns and\r\ncartridge clips into my pocket.\r\n\r\nI swung the door shut and locked it again, leaving Sgt. Robards inside.\r\nI stood for a moment in the corridor with the keys in my hand. There\r\nwere only ten keys, not enough to cover each individual cell. Yet Sgt.\r\nRobards had clinked these keys and said that he could unlock the cells.\r\n\r\nMaybe I would have done better to stick up the Territorial Governor.\r\n\r\nWell, here goes.\r\n\r\nI eased up to the first floor. Nobody came out of the second office to\r\ncheck on the noise made by my pounding heart, which surprised me. Then\r\nup to the second floor. It was dark here, but light from the first and\r\nthird floors leaking up and down the stairs made things bright enough\r\nfor me to see what I was doing. There were voices on the third floor\r\nand somebody laughed up there. I held my breath and moved quietly to\r\nJimmy's cell.\r\n\r\nI whispered, \"Jimmy!\" and he came alert and moved to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Am I glad to see you,\" he whispered back.\r\n\r\nI held up the keys. \"Do any of these fit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the D key. The D key. It fits the four cells in this corner.\"\r\n\r\nI fumbled through until I had the key tagged D. I opened the cell with\r\nas few clinking noises as possible. \"Come on,\" I said. \"We've got to\r\nget out of here in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped out and pushed the door shut behind him. We headed for the\r\nstairs and were almost there when I heard somebody coming up. Jimmy\r\nmust have heard it, too, because he grabbed my arm and pulled me back.\r\nWe flattened out as best we could.\r\n\r\nTalk about walking right into it! The policeman looked over at us and\r\nsaid, \"What are you doing up here, Robards? Hey, you're not....\"\r\n\r\nI stepped out and brought out one of the pistols. I said, \"Easy now. If\r\nthings go wrong for us, I have nothing to lose by shooting you. If you\r\nwant to live, play it straight.\"\r\n\r\nHe apparently believed me, because he put his hands where I could see\r\nthem and shut up.\r\n\r\nI herded him into Jimmy's cell and let Jimmy do the honors with the\r\nloaded sock. We taped him up and while Jimmy was locking him in, I\r\nheard somebody in one of the cells behind me say, \"Shut up, there,\" to\r\nsomebody else. I turned and said, \"Do you want to get shot?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was collected. \"No. No trouble here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you want to be let out?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice was amused. \"I don't think so. Thank you just the same.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy finished and I asked, \"Where is your signal? We have to have\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the basement with the rest of my gear.\"\r\n\r\nThe signal was all we took. When we were three blocks away and on a\r\ndark side street, I handed Jimmy his gun and ammunition. As he took\r\nthem, he said, \"Tell me something, Mia. Would you really have shot him?\"\r\n\r\nI said. \"I couldn't have. I hadn't loaded my gun yet.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI led him through town following the back ways I'd worked out before.\r\nSomebody once said that good luck is no more nor less than careful\r\npreparation, and this time I meant to have good luck. I led Jimmy\r\ntoward the Losel-selling district.\r\n\r\nJimmy is short and red-headed with a face that makes him look about\r\nfour years younger than he is. That's a handicap any time. When you\r\nstand out anyway, it's likely to make you a little bit tart. But\r\nJimmy's all right most of the time.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"We're in trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's brilliant.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Jimmy said. \"They have a scoutship from one of the other Ships.\r\nThis is going to sound wild, but they intend to use the scout to take\r\nover a Ship and then use that to destroy the rest of the Ships. They're\r\ngoing to try. The police are rounding up everybody who is opposed who\r\nhas any influence and is putting them in jail.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mia, are you mad at me for something?\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're being bitter about something.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you must know, it's that crack you made about me being a snob.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a month ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still resent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Jimmy asked. \"It's true. You think that because you're from a\r\nShip that you're automatically better than any Mud-eater. That makes\r\nyou a snob.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're no better,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not, but I don't pretend. Hey, look, we can't get anywhere if\r\nwe fight and we've got to stick together. I'll tell you what. I'll\r\napologize. I'm sorry I said it, even if it is true. Make up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" I said. But that was a typical trick of his. Get the last blow\r\nin and then call the whole thing off.\r\n\r\nWhen we got to Horst Fanger's place, I said, \"I've got our packs all\r\nset up. This is where we get our horses.\" I'd left this until last,\r\nnot wanting people running around looking for stolen horses while I was\r\ntrying to break somebody out of the police jail pen. Besides, for this\r\nI wanted somebody along as lookout.\r\n\r\nThere was a fetid, unwashed odor that hung about the pens that the\r\nmisting rain did nothing to dispel. We slipped by the pens, the Losels\r\nwatching us but making no noise, and came to the stables, which smelled\r\nbetter. Jimmy stood guard while I broke the lock and slipped inside.\r\n\r\nNinc was there, good old Nincompoop, and a quick search turned up his\r\nsaddle as well. I saddled him up and then stood watch while Jimmy\r\npicked himself out a horse and gear. I did one last thing before\r\nI left. I took out the pencil and paper in my pocket and wrote in\r\n_correct_ Inter E, in great big letters: I'M A _GIRL_, YOU STINKER. I\r\nhung it on a nail. It may have been childish, but it felt good.\r\n\r\nWe rode from there to Mr. Kutsov's house, still following back alleys.\r\nAs we rode, I told Jimmy about Mr. Kutsov and what he'd done for me.\r\n\r\nWhen we got there, we rode around to the back.\r\n\r\n\"Hold the horses,\" I said. \"I'll slip in and get the packs. They're\r\njust inside.\"\r\n\r\nWe both dismounted and Jimmy took Ninc's reins. I bounded up the steps.\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov was waiting in the dark inside. He said, \"I read your note.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come back?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"It didn't seem right to leave you here by yourself. I be\r\nsorry. I think I underestimated you. Be that Jimmy Dentremont outside?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I ben't angry. I understand why you couldn't tell me.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I started crying and couldn't stop. The tears ran down\r\nmy face. \"I'm sorry,\" I said. \"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\nThe front door signal sounded then and Mr. Kutsov answered the door.\r\nA green-uniformed policeman stood in the doorway. \"Daniel Kutsov?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nInstinctively, I shrank back out of sight of the doorway. I swiped at\r\nmy face with my sleeve.\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov said, \"Yes. What can I do for you.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman moved one step inside the house where I could see him\r\nagain. He said in a flat voice, \"I have a warrant for your arrest.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was only one light on in the house, in the front room. From the\r\nshadows at the rear I watched them both. The policeman had a hard mask\r\nfor a face, no more human than a Losel. Mr. Kutsov was determined and I\r\nhad the feeling that he had forgotten my presence.\r\n\r\n\"To jail again? For my book?\" He shook his head. \"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It be nothing to do with any book I know of, Kutsov. It be known that\r\nyou be an Anti-Redemptionist. So come along.\" He grasped Mr. Kutsov's\r\narm.\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov shook loose. \"No. I won't go to jail again. It be no crime\r\nto be against stupidity. I won't go.\"\r\n\r\nThe policeman said, \"You be coming whether you want to or not. You be\r\nunder arrest.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov's voice had never shown his age before, but it shook now.\r\n\"Get out of my house!\"\r\n\r\nA sense of coming destruction grew on me as I saw the policeman lift\r\nhis gun from its holster and say, \"You be coming if I have to shoot.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kutsov swung his fist at the policeman and missed and, as though\r\nthe man could afford to let nothing pass without retaliation, he swung\r\nthe barrel of his pistol dully against the side of Mr. Kutsov's head.\r\nIt rocked Mr. Kutsov, but he didn't fall. He raised his fist again. The\r\npoliceman struck once more and waited but Mr. Kutsov still didn't fall.\r\nInstead, he swung again, and for the first time he landed, a blow that\r\nbounced weakly off the man's shoulder. Almost inevitably, it seemed,\r\nthe policeman raised his pistol and fired directly at Mr. Kutsov, and\r\nthen again, and as the second report rang Mr. Kutsov slid to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe silence was loud and gaunt. The policeman stood looking down at him\r\nand said, \"Old fool!\" under his breath. Then he came to himself and\r\nlooked around. Then he picked a candlestick off the table and dropped\r\nit with a thud by Mr. Kutsov's empty outstretched hand.\r\n\r\nThe noise was a release for me and I moved for the first time. The\r\npoliceman grunted and looked up and we stared at each other. Then\r\nagain, slowly, he raised his gun and pointed it at me.\r\n\r\nI heard a snickering sound and the three reports rang out, one\r\nfollowing another. The policeman stood for a moment, balanced himself\r\nand then, like a crumpled sheet of paper, he fell to the floor. I\r\ndidn't even look at Jimmy behind me. I started to cry and I went to Mr.\r\nKutsov, passing by the policeman without even looking at him. As I bent\r\ndown beside him, his eyes opened and he looked at me.\r\n\r\nI couldn't stop crying. I held his head and cried. \"I'm sorry,\" I said.\r\n\"I'm sorry.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled and said faintly, but clearly, \"It be all right.\" After a\r\nminute he closed his eyes, and then he died.\r\n\r\nAfter another minute, Jimmy touched my arm and said, \"There's nothing\r\nwe can do. Let's leave now, Mia, while we still can.\"\r\n\r\nOutside, it was still raining. Standing in the rain I felt deserted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\nThe final morning on Tintera was a fine day. We and the horses were in\r\na rock-enclosed aerie where we had dodged the day before for shelter.\r\nIn the aerie were grass and a small rock spring, and this day, the\r\nfinal day, was bright with blue and piled clouds riding high.\r\n\r\nFrom where we sat, looking from the top of the rock wall, we could see\r\nover miles of expanse. Lower hills and curving valleys all covered\r\nwith a rolling carpet of trees, a carpet of varying shades of gray\r\nand green. There were some natural upland meadows, and clearings in\r\nthe valleys, and far away a line drawn in the trees that might be the\r\npath of a river. Down there, under that carpet, were all sorts of\r\nthings--wild Losels, men hunting us, and--perhaps--some of the others\r\nfrom the Ship. We had seen the Losels and they had seen us; they had\r\ngone their way and we had gone ours. The men hunting us for blowing up\r\ntheir scoutship we hadn't seen for four days, and even then they hadn't\r\nseen us. As for the others, we hadn't seen them at all. But they might\r\nbe there, under the anonymous carpet.\r\n\r\nJimmy got up from the ground and brushed himself off. He brought the\r\nsignal over to me and said, \"Should I, or do you want to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe triggered it.\r\n\r\nGeorge Fuhonin was piloting and we were the sixth and seventh aboard.\r\nThe other five crowded around and helped us put our gear away. Jimmy\r\nwent on inside and I went upstairs to talk to George.\r\n\r\nI was up there by the time we were airborne. \"Hello, Halfpint,\" George\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Georgie-Worgie,\" I said, dealing blow for blow. \"Have you had any\r\ntrouble picking us up?\"\r\n\r\n\"No trouble yet. You trying to wish me problems?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"This is a real nasty planet. They had Jimmy D. locked up\r\nin jail. They hate everybody from the Ships.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" George raised his eyebrows. \"Well, that might explain the\r\nboard.\" He pointed to the board of lights above and to his left.\r\nTwenty-nine were marked for the twenty-nine of us. Of the twenty-nine,\r\nonly twelve were lit. \"The last light came on two hours ago. If there\r\naren't any more, this will be the most fatal Trial Group I've ever\r\npicked up.\"\r\n\r\nI stayed upstairs through two more pickups. Joe Fernandez-Fragoso,\r\nand then another double of which Venie Morlock was one half. I went\r\ndownstairs to say hello to her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe were just settling down when George set off the alarm. He was\r\nspeaking in the elder brother tone that I can't stand.\r\n\r\n\"All right, kids--shut up and listen. One of our people is down there.\r\nI didn't get close enough to see who. Whoever it is is surrounded by\r\nsome of the local peasantry and we've got to bust him out. I'm going\r\nto buzz down and try to land on some of them. Then I want all of you\r\noutside and laying down a covering fire. Got that? I'm starting on down\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the kids had their weapons with them, but Jimmy and I didn't.\r\nWe hopped for the gear racks and got out our pistols. There were ten of\r\nus and four ramps to the outside. Jimmy and I had No. 3 to ourselves.\r\nGeorge is a hotrodder, as I've said, and after he gave us a long moment\r\nto get in place, he started down, a stomach-heaving swoop. Then he\r\ntouched down light as a feather and dropped the ramps.\r\n\r\nJimmy and I dived down the ramp and I went left and he went right. We\r\nwere on a slight slope facing down and my momentum and the slant put me\r\nright where I wanted to be--flat on my face. I rolled behind a tree and\r\nlooked over to see Jimmy almost hidden in a bush.\r\n\r\nHere, hundreds of miles from where we had been picked up, it was\r\nmisting under a familiar rolled gray sky. In my ears was the sound of\r\ngunfire from the other side of the ship and from below us. Our boy\r\nwas pinned fifty yards down the slope behind some rocks that barely\r\nprotected him. He was fighting back. I could see the sighting beam of\r\nhis sonic pistol slapping out. About thirty feet away from him toward\r\nus was the body of his horse. I recognized him then--a meatball named\r\nRiggy Allen.\r\n\r\nI took all this in in seconds, and then I raised my pistol and fired,\r\naiming at his attackers. They were dug in behind trees and rocks, at\r\nleast partly hidden from Riggy as he was hidden from them. From where\r\nwe were, though, above and looking down, they could be picked out. The\r\ndistance was too great for my shot and it plowed up earth ten feet\r\nshort, but the man I aimed at ducked back behind cover.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain satisfaction in one of these guns. Where a sonic\r\npistol is silent, these made enough noise that you knew you were doing\r\nsomething. And when you missed with a sonic pistol, all you could\r\nexpect at most was a shriveled branch or a sere and yellow leaf, but a\r\nmiss with this gun could send up a gout of earth or drive a hole in a\r\ntree big enough to scare the steadiest man you can find.\r\n\r\nI aimed higher and started to loft my shots in. Jimmy was doing the\r\nsame thing, and the net effect was to keep their heads down. Riggy\r\nfinally got the idea after a long moment. He stood up and started\r\nracing up the hill. Then my gun clicked empty, and a second later the\r\nfiring to my right stopped. I started to fumble for another clip.\r\n\r\nAs our fire stopped, those heads popped back up again and took in the\r\nsituation. They began to fire again and our boy Riggy took a long step\r\nand then dived over the body of his horse and went flat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a moment I was firing again, and then Jimmy was, too, and Riggy was\r\nup and running again. Then I started thinking clearly and held my fire\r\nwhile Jimmy emptied his clip. The instant he stopped, I started again,\r\na regular squeeze, squeeze, squeeze. As I finished, Jimmy opened with\r\nhis new clip and then Riggy was past us and up the ramp. He went flat\r\nin the doorway there and started firing his sonic pistol; its range was\r\ngreater than our peashooters and he hosed the whole area down while\r\nJimmy and I sprinted for the ramp.\r\n\r\nAs we hit the inside of the ship, I yelled, \"Raise No. 3!\" George had\r\neither been watching or listening, because it lifted smoothly up and\r\nlocked in place.\r\n\r\nShots were still coming from the other sides of the ship, so I yelled\r\nat Jimmy to go left. Riggy just stood there for a moment fuzzy-headed,\r\nbut Jimmy gave him a shove to the right and he finally got the idea.\r\nI cut through the middle. In the doorway of No. 1, I skidded flat on\r\nmy face again and looked for targets. I dropped all my clips in front\r\nof me and began to fire. When the clip was empty, in two quick motions\r\nI pulled out the old one and slapped in the new and fired again. The\r\nthree I was covering for used their heads and slipped in one at a time.\r\n\r\nAs the second one came aboard, I heard Jimmy's voice call to raise No.\r\n2 from my left. My third was Venie Morlock and as she ran aboard, I\r\ncouldn't resist tripping her flat. I yelled to George to raise No. 1.\r\n\r\nVenie glared at me and demanded, \"What was that for?\" as the ramp swung\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Just making sure you didn't get shot,\" I said, lying.\r\n\r\nA second later, Riggy yelled that his side was okay and the last ramp\r\nwas raised. My last view of Tintera was of a rainsoaked hillside and\r\nmen doing their best to kill us, which all seems appropriate somehow.\r\nAs the last ramp locked in place, George lifted the ship again and\r\nheaded for the next pickup.\r\n\r\nI went over to say hello to Riggy. He'd been completely unhurt by the\r\nbarrage, but he had a great gash on his arm that was just starting to\r\nheal. He _said_ that he was minding his own business in the woods one\r\nday when a Losel jumped out from behind a bush and slashed him. That\r\nmay sound reasonable to you, but you don't know Riggy. I do. My opinion\r\nis that it was probably the other way around--the Losel was walking\r\nalong in the woods one day, minding his own business, when _Riggy_\r\njumped out from a bush and scared him. That is the sort of thing Riggy\r\nis inclined to do.\r\n\r\nRiggy had been sneaking a look at my gun, and now he said, \"Where did\r\nyou get that neat pistol? Let me see it.\"\r\n\r\nI handed it over.\r\n\r\nAfter a minute of inspection, Riggy asked, \"You wouldn't want to trade,\r\nwould you?\"\r\n\r\n\"For your sonic pistol?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You want to?\"\r\n\r\nI considered it for a minute, and then I said, \"All right,\" and we\r\ntraded. There is a certain amount of satisfaction in shooting an\r\nantique like that, but I know which is the more effective weapon.\r\nBesides, I only had one full clip of ammunition left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount of prestige in coming back alive from\r\nSurvival. It's your key to adulthood. There were no brass bands waiting\r\nfor us when we got back, but our families were there, and that was\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe fifteen of us went down the lowered ramp, and when I stood again on\r\nsolid rock, I looked around that ugly, bare scout bay and just drank it\r\nin. Home.\r\n\r\nI turned to Jimmy then and I said, \"Jimmy, it's a relief to be back,\r\nisn't it? And that isn't snobbery. It might have been before, but I\r\ndon't think I am now.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Jimmy nodded.\r\n\r\nThe waiting room wasn't bare. They had the decorations up for Year End,\r\ncolored mobiles with lights that ranged through the spectrum, and more\r\ndecorations on the walls. In the crowd of people waiting for us, I saw\r\nJimmy's mother and her present husband, and Jimmy's father and _his_\r\nwife. When they saw Jimmy, they started waving and shouting.\r\n\r\nJust as I said, \"I'll see you tonight,\" I saw Mother and Daddy standing\r\noff to one side, and I waved. It was as though I had left the real\r\nworld entirely for a month, and now at last I was back where things\r\nwere going on and I wasn't missing a thing. I ran to them and I kissed\r\nMother and hugged Daddy. Mother was crying.\r\n\r\nI leaned back in Daddy's arms and looked up at him. He put a measuring\r\nhand over my head and said, \"Mia, I believe you've grown some.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be so. I felt taller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Down to the Worlds of Men, by Alexei Panshin",
