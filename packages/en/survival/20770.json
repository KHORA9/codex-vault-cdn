It has been my aim to set down only such\r\nfacts as would be of practical value to an owner of such a farm and to\r\nstate these facts in the plain language of experience. This book is in\r\nno sense intended as a final scientific treatment of the subject, and\r\nif it is of any value in helping to make the fruit department of the\r\ngeneral farm more profitable the author will be entirely satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe facts herein set down were first learned in the school of\r\npractical experience on the writer's own farm in Western New York.\r\nThey were afterwards supplemented by some theoretical training and by\r\na rather wide observation of farm orchard conditions and methods in\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, the New England States and other contiguous\r\nterritory. These facts were first put together in something like\r\ntheir present form in the winter of 1909-10, when the writer gave a\r\nseries of lectures on Commercial Fruit Growing to the Short Courses in\r\nHorticulture at Cornell University. These lectures were revised and\r\nrepeated in 1910-11 and are now put in their present form.\r\n\r\nThe author's sincere thanks are due to Professor C.S. Wilson, of the\r\nDepartment of Pomology at Cornell University, for many valuable facts\r\nand suggestions used in this book, and for a careful reading of the\r\nmanuscript. He is also under obligations to Mr. Roy D. Anthony of the\r\nsame Department for corrections and suggestions on the chapters on\r\nInsects and Diseases and on Spraying.\r\n\r\n                                                  M.C.

Few fruits can be utilized in as many ways as can the\r\napple. In addition to the common use of the fresh fruit out of hand\r\nand of the fresh, sweet juice as cider, this \"King of Fruits\" can be\r\ncooked, baked, dried, canned, and made into jellies and other\r\nappetizing dishes, to enumerate all of which would be to prepare a\r\nlist pages long. Few who have tasted once want to be without their\r\napple sauce and apple pies in season, not to mention the crisp, juicy\r\nspecimens to eat out of hand by the open fireplace in the long winter\r\nevenings. Apples thus served call up pleasant memories to most of us,\r\nbut only recently have the culinary possibilities of the apple,\r\nespecially as a dessert fruit, been fully realized.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless this realization of its great adaptability, together\r\nwith its long season, which have brought the apple into so great\r\ndemand of late. It is possible to have apples on the table in some\r\nform the year round. The first summer apples are almost always with us\r\nbefore the bottom of the Russet barrel is reached. Or, should the\r\nfresh fruit be too expensive or for some reason fail altogether, the\r\nhousewife can fall back on the canned and dried fruit which are almost\r\nas good.\r\n\r\nThe tendency in the price of this staple fruit has been constantly\r\nupward during the last decade. Many people are greatly surprised when\r\nthe fact that apples cost more than oranges is called to their\r\nattention. The increase in consumption, due to the greater variety of\r\nways of preparing the apple for use, has undoubtedly been an important\r\nfactor in this higher price. But at least an equally important factor\r\nis the marked decrease in the supply of this fruit. To those who are\r\nnot familiar with the facts, the great falling off in production which\r\nthe figures show will be no less than startling.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF APPLES IN BARRELS IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 1896 TO 1910\r\n\r\n 1896                                   69,070,000\r\n 1897                                   41,530,000\r\n 1898                                   28,570,000\r\n 1899                                   37,460,000\r\n 1900                                   56,820,000\r\n                                       -----------\r\n Total crop for five years             233,450,000\r\n Average crop for five years                       46,690,000\r\n 1901                                   26,970,000\r\n 1902                                   46,625,000\r\n 1903                                   42,626,000\r\n 1904                                   45,360,000\r\n 1905                                   24,310,000\r\n                                       ------------\r\n Total crop for five years             185,891,000\r\n Average crop for five years                       37,178,200\r\n 1906                                   38,280,000\r\n 1907                                   29,540,000\r\n 1908                                   25,850,000\r\n 1909                                   25,415,000\r\n 1910                                   23,825,000\r\n Total crop for five years             142,910,000\r\n                                      ------------\r\n Average crop for five years                       28,582,000\r\n\r\n Estimates of 1896, 1897, and 1898 from \"Better Fruit,\" Vol. 5,\r\n No. 5. All other years from the estimates of the \"American\r\n Agriculturist.\"\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the apple crop of 1910 was 45,245,000\r\nbarrels less than that of 1896, and that during the whole period of\r\nfifteen years the decline has been regular. The average annual crop of\r\nthe five year period ending with 1905 was 9,511,800 barrels less than\r\nthe average annual crop of the preceding five years ending with 1900,\r\nand correspondingly the annual average crop of the last five years,\r\nending with 1910, was 8,596,200 barrels less than that of the second\r\nfive year period. Comparing the first and the last five year periods,\r\nwe find that the crop of the last was 18,108,000 barrels less than\r\nthat of the first. These facts alone are enough to explain the higher\r\nprice of this fruit during the last ten years.\r\n\r\nHEAVY PLANTINGS.--Moreover, it should be further noted that this\r\nfalling off in the apple crop has been in the face of the heaviest\r\nplantings ever known in this country. During the last ten years old\r\nfruit growing regions like western New York have practically doubled\r\ntheir orchard plantings. Careful figures gathered by the New York\r\nState Agricultural College in an orchard survey of Monroe County show\r\nthat 4,972 more trees (21,289 in all) were planted in one\r\nrepresentative township during the five year period from 1904 to 1908\r\ninclusive than were ever planted in any other equal period in its\r\nhistory. New fruit regions like the Northwestern States and a large\r\npart of the Shenandoah valley of Virginia have been developed by heavy\r\nplantings. These three are all great commercial sections. To them we\r\nmight add thousands of orchards which are scattered all over the\r\nNorthern and Eastern States, from Michigan to Maine and from Maine to\r\nnorth Georgia.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful, however, if these scattered plantings have made good\r\nthe older trees which have died out. Scarcely a season passes that\r\nhundreds of these old veteran trees are not blown down or badly\r\nbroken. Every wind takes its toll. After one of these windstorms in\r\nSouthern New York the writer estimated that at least twenty per cent\r\nof all the standing old apple trees had been destroyed or badly\r\nbroken. In the commercial regions only a small part of the new\r\nplantings have yet come to bearing and even here these probably do not\r\nmuch more than make good the losses of old trees. So that on the\r\nwhole, heavy as our plantings have been, it is extremely doubtful if\r\nthey have very much more than made good the losses of the older trees\r\nthroughout the country. It is a fact worthy of note that this talk of\r\nover-planting the apple has been going on for over thirty years, and\r\nwhile the timid ones talked those who had faith in the business and\r\nthe courage of their convictions planted apples and reaped golden\r\nharvests while their neighbors still talked of over-planting.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it is true that we have over-planted the apple, it must\r\nbe admitted that at the present time the demand is so much greater\r\nthan the supply that the poorer of our people cannot afford to use\r\napples commonly, and that no class of farmer in the Northeastern\r\nStates is more prosperous than the fruit growers. The new plantings\r\nmust of necessity begin to bear and become factors in the market very\r\nslowly. Meanwhile the great opportunity of the present lies in making\r\nthe most possible out of the older orchards which are already in\r\nbearing. Practically all of these old farm orchards which can present\r\na fairly clean bill of health, and in which the varieties are\r\ndesirable, can with a small amount of well directed effort be put to\r\nwork at once and during the next ten years or more of their life time,\r\nthey may be made to add a substantial income to that of the general\r\nfarm. Now is a time of opportunity for the owner of the small farm\r\napple orchard.\r\n\r\nFUTURE OF APPLE GROWING.--In the writer's opinion the future of apple\r\ngrowing in the United States is likely to shape itself largely in the\r\ngreat commercial regions. As these become more and more developed and\r\nas the industry becomes more specialized the farmer who is merely\r\ngrowing apples as a side line, except where he is delivering directly\r\nto a special or a local market, will be crowded out. Here as elsewhere\r\nit will be a case of the survival of the fittest. In the production of\r\napples commercially those growers who can produce the best article the\r\nmost cheaply are bound to win out in the end.\r\n\r\nIt would, therefore, seem to be advisable for the general farmer to\r\nplant apples only under two conditions; first, when he has a very\r\nfavorable location and site and plants heavily enough to make it worth\r\nwhile to have the equipment and skilled labor necessary to make the\r\nenterprise a success, and second, when he can market his fruit\r\ndirectly in a local market. It would appear that the immediate future\r\nof apple growing in the United States lies in the small farm orchard\r\nas well as in the commercial orchards, but that the more distant\r\nfuture lies in the commercial orchard except where special conditions\r\nsurround the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPLANNING FOR THE ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.--Having decided that under certain conditions the planting\r\nof an apple orchard will prove a profitable venture, and having\r\nascertained that those conditions prevail on your farm, the next step\r\nwill be to determine the best location on the farm for the orchard. In\r\nchoosing this location it will be well to keep in mind the relative\r\nimportance of the orchard in the scheme of farm management. If the\r\norchard is merely a source of home supply, naturally it will not\r\nrequire as important a position on the farm as will be the case if it\r\nis expected to yield a larger share of the farm income. If the\r\nrelatively large net income per acre which it is possible to obtain\r\nfrom an apple orchard is to be secured, the best possible location is\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nContrary to the common ideas and practice of the past, the orchard\r\nshould not be put upon the poorest soil on the farm. The best\r\norchards occupy the best soils, although fairly good results are often\r\nobtained on poor or medium soils. The relative importance which is\r\nattached to the orchard enterprise must also govern the choice of\r\nsoil. If apples are to be a prominent crop they should be given the\r\npreference as to soil; if not, they may be given a place in accordance\r\nwith what is expected of them.\r\n\r\nSOILS.--In general, the apple prefers a rather strong soil, neither\r\nvery heavy nor very light. Subsoil is rather more important than\r\nsurface soil, although the latter should be friable and easily worked.\r\nThe apple follows good timber successfully. Heavy clay soils are apt\r\nto be too cold, compact, and wet; light sandy soils too loose and dry.\r\nA medium clay loam or a gravelly clay loam, underlaid by a somewhat\r\nheavier but fairly open clay subsoil is thought to be the best soil\r\nfor apples. Broadly considered, medium loams are best. The lighter the\r\nsoil the better will be the color of the fruit as a rule, and so,\r\nalso, the heavier the soil and the more nitrogen and moisture it holds\r\nthe greater the tendency to poorly colored fruit. In the same way\r\nlight soils give poorer wood and foliage growth as compared with the\r\nlarge rank leaves and wood of trees on heavy, rich soils.\r\n\r\nVARIETAL SOIL PREFERENCES are beginning to be recognized. We cannot go\r\ninto these in detail in this brief discussion. A few suggestions\r\nregarding standard varieties must suffice. Medium to light loams or\r\nheavy sandy loams, underlaid by slightly heavier loams or clay loams,\r\nare preferred by the Baldwin, which has a wider soil adaptation than\r\npractically any other variety. Baldwin soils should dry quickly after\r\na rain. Rhode Island Greening requires a rather rich, moist, but well\r\ndrained soil, containing an abundance of organic matter. A light to\r\nheavy silty loam, underlaid by a silty clay loam, is considered best.\r\n\r\nNorthern Spy is very exacting in its soil requirements. A medium loam,\r\nunderlaid by a heavy loam or a light clay loam, is excellent. Heavy\r\nsoils give the Spy a greasy skin. Light soils cause the tree to grow\r\nupright and to bear fruit of poor flavor. The King likes a soil\r\nslightly lighter than the best Greening soils, but retentive of\r\nmoisture. Hubbardson will utilize the sandiest soil of any northern\r\nvariety, preferring rich, fine, sandy loams.\r\n\r\nThe particular location of the apple orchard is largely a matter of\r\nconvenience. It should be remembered, however, that the apple requires\r\nmuch and constant attention, therefore the orchard should be\r\nconvenient of access. The product is rather bulky, so that the haul to\r\nthe highway should be as short as possible. Other conditions being\r\nequally good there, the common location near the buildings and highway\r\nis best.\r\n\r\nTHE SITE OF THE ORCHARD is a more important matter. Two essentials\r\nshould be kept in mind, good air drainage and a considerable\r\nelevation. Although it is not so apparent and therefore less thought\r\nabout, cold air runs down hill the same as water. Being heavier, it\r\nfalls to the surface of the land, flowing out through the water\r\nchannels and settling in pockets and depressions. Warm air, being\r\nlighter, rises. It is desirable to avoid conditions of stagnant air or\r\ncold air pockets where frost and fogs are liable to occur. A free\r\nmovement of air, especially a draining away of cold air, is best\r\nsecured by an elevation. Fifty to one hundred feet, or sometimes less,\r\nis usually sufficient, especially where there is good outlet below.\r\nFrosts occur in still, clear air and these conditions occur most\r\nfrequently in the lower areas.\r\n\r\nAspect or slope requires less attention. Southern exposures are warm\r\nand hasten bud development and opening in spring. Northern exposures\r\nare cold and retard the blossoming period. It is usually advisable to\r\nplant the apple on the colder slopes which hold it back in spring\r\nuntil all danger of late frosts is past. Northeast exposures are best\r\nas a general rule. Choose a slope away from the prevailing wind if\r\npossible. If this is impracticable it is often advisable to plant a\r\nwind break of pine, spruce, or a quick, thick growing native tree to\r\nprotect the orchard from heavy winds.\r\n\r\nA large body of water is an important modifier of climate. Warming up\r\nmore slowly in the spring, it retards vegetation by slowly giving up\r\nits cold. Vice versa, cooling more slowly in the fall giving up its\r\nheat wards off the early frosts. It is therefore desirable to locate\r\nnear such bodies of water if possible. Their influence varies\r\naccording to their size and depth, and the distance of the orchard\r\nfrom them. Good examples of this influence are the Chautauqua Grape\r\nBelt on the eastern shore of Lake Erie and the Western New York Apple\r\nBelt on the south shore of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brackett has well summed up the whole question: \"The\r\nselection of the soil and site for the apple orchard is not governed\r\nby any arbitrary rule,\" he says. \"All farms do not afford the best\r\nsoils or exposures for orchards. The owners of such as do not are\r\nunfortunate, yet they should not feel discouraged to the extent of not\r\nplanting trees and caring for them afterward.\" There are a number of\r\nfactors which influence not only a person who wishes to locate, but\r\none already located, either favorably or unfavorably. About these even\r\nthe most intelligent orchardists often differ. We have only laid down\r\ngeneral principles and given opinions. Here as elsewhere application\r\nis a matter of judgment.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES.--A proper soil and a good location and site having been\r\nselected, the next important question to be decided is the varieties\r\nto be planted. So much and so variable advice is given on this\r\nquestion that many persons are at a loss as to what to plant and too\r\noften decide the matter by planting the wrong varieties. Rightly\r\nviewed, the question of varieties is a comparatively simple one.\r\nPersonal preference, tempered by careful study of certain factors and\r\ngood judgment, are all that are required. Beginners, especially, are\r\ntoo apt to rely entirely on another's opinion. The only safe way is to\r\nlearn the facts and then decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nWe have already indicated that soil is a determinant in the choice of\r\nvarieties. This should be absolute. It is very unwise to try to grow\r\nany variety on a soil where experience has shown that it does not do\r\nwell. The experience of your neighbors is the best guide in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nThe limitations of climate should also be carefully heeded. An apple\r\nmay be at its best in one latitude or one situation and at its worst\r\nin another. Find out from experienced growers in your region, or from\r\nyour State Experiment Station what varieties are best adapted\r\nclimatically to the place where you live. It is an excellent rule\r\nnever to plant a variety that you cannot grow at least as well as any\r\none else, or still better, to plant a variety that you can grow better\r\nthan anyone else. Grow something that not everyone can grow. Do not\r\ntry to produce more of a variety of which there is already an over\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nA few examples may make this more clear. Western New York is the home\r\nof the Baldwin, the Twenty Ounce and the King. Albemarle Pippins grown\r\non the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge are famous. The Spitzenburg\r\nappears at its best in the Northwest. The Northern Spy, the McIntosh,\r\nand the Fameuse are not to be excelled as they are grown in the\r\nChamplain Valley, in Vermont, or in Maine. To attempt to compete with\r\nthese sections in the growing of these varieties, except under equally\r\nfavorable conditions, would be foolish. Your section probably grows\r\nsome varieties to perfection. Find out what these varieties are and\r\nplant them.\r\n\r\nAll these are general factors to be observed which cannot be\r\nspecifically settled without knowing the soil and particular locality.\r\nCertain other factors governing the choice of varieties can be more\r\ndefinitely outlined. If the prospective orchardist will get these\r\nfactors thoroughly in mind and apply them with judgment mistakes in\r\nplanting should be much more rare. The more important ones are: The\r\npurpose for which the fruit is intended to be used, whether for the\r\ngeneral market, a dessert or fancy trade, or for culinary and general\r\ntable use; whether the trees are to be permanent and long lived, or\r\ntemporary and used as fillers; whether the earliest possible income is\r\ndesired or whether this is to be secondary to the future development\r\nof the orchard; whether the stock of the particular variety is strong\r\nor weak growing; whether the variety is high, medium, or low as to\r\nquality; and whether the market is to be local, distant, or export.\r\n\r\nThe following tables were originally compiled by Professor C.S.

It should be used as such and not taken literally. The\r\ncharacters of the different varieties grade into each other. For\r\nexample, the McIntosh is very high and the Ben Davis is very low in\r\nquality but the King and the Twenty Ounce are neither very good nor\r\nvery poor, but midway between.\r\n\r\nWe must again remind the reader that the choice of varieties is a\r\nmatter of judgment, tempered by the facts regarding them. One who is\r\nnot capable of rendering such judgment after studying his conditions\r\nand the characteristics and requirements of leading varieties had\r\nbetter stay out of the apple business entirely, as he will often be\r\ncalled on for the exercise of good judgment in caring for the orchard.\r\nThe facts here given are intended as suggestive. The reader who\r\ndesires to know more of a particular variety will do well to consult\r\nBeach's \"Apples of New York,\" published by the Geneva Experiment\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPLANTING AND GROWING THE ORCHARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper soil, site, and location having been selected, the solution\r\nof the problems of orchard management is only just begun, although a\r\ngood start has certainly been made. Farm management brings constantly\r\nto one's attention new problems and new phases of old problems,\r\nwhatever the type of farming. The skill with which these problems are\r\nmet and a solution found for them determines the success or failure of\r\nthe farm manager. To some men the details of the orchard business\r\noffer the greatest obstacles, while to others it is the general\r\nrelationship of one detail to another which is difficult. Both are\r\nessentials of good management. If we are able in this chapter to\r\nremove some of these minor difficulties and at the same time indicate\r\nthe correct relationships we will have accomplished our purpose.\r\n\r\nAs we come now to the actual plans for planting our orchard many\r\nquestions come up for answer. When shall I plant? Where and of whom\r\nshall I purchase my trees? How old should they be? Is it wise to use\r\nfillers or temporary trees, and if so, what kind? How far apart should\r\nthe trees be planted and how many are required for an acre? What\r\narrangement of the trees is most advisable? How should the ground be\r\nprepared? What is the best method of setting? When the trees are\r\nplanted should they be inter-cropped, and if so, with what? How should\r\nthe young trees be handled and cared for? He who would be a successful\r\norchardist must endeavor to answer these questions.\r\n\r\nWHEN TO PLANT.--The question of fall or spring planting is a less\r\nimportant one with a comparatively hardy fruit like the apple than it\r\nis with a more tender fruit like the peach. Apples may safely be\r\nplanted in the fall when soils are well drained and when the young\r\ntrees are well matured, both of which are very important if winter\r\ninjury is to be avoided. Fall planting has several distinct\r\nadvantages. During the winter fall planted trees become well\r\nestablished in the soil which enables them to start root growth\r\nearlier in the spring. Consequently the young trees are better able to\r\nendure droughts. In the fall the weather is usually more settled and\r\nthere is better opportunity to plant under favorable conditions than\r\nin the unsettled weather of spring. It is usually possible, too, to\r\nget a better selection of trees at the nursery in the fall because\r\nmost of the trees are not sold until midwinter.\r\n\r\nStill the fact remains that the common practice of spring planting is\r\nthe more conservative course. There is always danger of getting\r\nimmature trees in the fall, and of winter injury to fall planted\r\ntrees. Trees may be set in the fall any time after the buds are mature\r\nwhich is usually after October 1st to 18th in the latitude of New\r\nYork. They should not be pruned back in the fall, as this invites\r\nwinter killing of the uppermost buds. The question of available time\r\nmust also be considered. On some farms fall offers more time; on\r\nothers, spring. To sum up the matter, plant at the most convenient\r\ntime, providing the conditions are favorable.\r\n\r\nWHERE TO BUY.--But one rule as to where to buy trees can be laid down.\r\nBuy where you can secure the best trees and where you can be sure of\r\nthe most reliable and honest dealers. Beware of the tree agent, who\r\nhas been guilty of more dishonesty and misrepresentation than almost\r\nany other traveling agent. Buy of a salesman under one condition only,\r\nthat he prove to you that he is the bona fide representative of a\r\nwell-known and reputable nursery firm, and then make your order\r\nsubject to investigation of the firm's standing and finding it as\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nThe safest course is usually to purchase of your home nurseryman with\r\nwhose standing and honesty you are familiar, and whose trees you can\r\npersonally inspect. Such a man has a reputation at stake and will have\r\nan object in keeping your trade. Moreover, you will save freight,\r\nsecure fresher stock with less liability of injury in handling, and\r\nget trees grown under your own conditions. If stock is purchased away\r\nfrom home it is better to get it at a nursery in a more southern\r\nlatitude in order to secure trees of better growth.\r\n\r\nAll trees should be purchased in the late summer or early fall when\r\nthe nurseryman has a full list of varieties and you can get the pick\r\nof his stock. Select a well grown mature tree two years old from the\r\nbud. One year old trees are preferred by many and if well grown and at\r\nleast five feet high they are probably best. But a one year old tree\r\nis rather more delicate, requiring careful handling and intelligent\r\ntraining. Unless a person buys from a southern nursery and is an\r\nexpert in handling trees, the two year old tree is to be preferred,\r\nbut a skilful grower can make a more satisfactory tree from a one year\r\nold seedling.\r\n\r\nThe average buyer must depend largely on his nurseryman for getting\r\ntrees true to name, which is the reason for laying so much emphasis on\r\npurchasing from an honest dealer. Some nurserymen guarantee their\r\nvarieties to be true to name, and all ought to do so. Buyers should\r\ndemand it. The seeds of the apple rarely come true to the variety\r\nplanted. They are therefore usually budded on one year old seedlings\r\nimported from France. Sometimes they are whole or piece root grafted\r\nwhich is equally as good a method of propagation.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for a man to grow and bud or graft his own seedlings,\r\nbut hardly advisable for the average small grower or general farmer,\r\nas it is usually expensive when done on a small scale and requires\r\nconsiderable skill. Always buy a high grade tree. Seconds are often\r\nequally as good as firsts when they are simply smaller as a result of\r\ncrowding in the nursery row. A tree which is second grade because of\r\nbeing stunted, crooked, or poorly grown should never be set. Thirds\r\nare seldom worth considering at any price.\r\n\r\nFILLERS.--Whether or not the planter of an apple orchard should use\r\nfillers is a question which he alone must decide. In the writer's\r\nopinion there are more advantages than disadvantages in so doing, but\r\nwe must state both sides of the question and let the reader judge for\r\nhimself. The term \"filler\" is one used to designate a tree planted in\r\nthe orchard for the temporary purpose of profitably occupying the\r\nspace between the permanent trees while these are growing and not yet\r\nin bearing. Fillers make a more complete use of the land, bringing in\r\nlarger as well as quicker returns from it, three distinct advantages.\r\n(See Chapter XII, The Cost of Growing Apples.) On the other hand,\r\nobjections to their use are that they are often left in so long that\r\nthey crowd and seriously injure the permanent trees, and that their\r\ncare often requires different operations and at different times from\r\nthe other trees, such as spraying, which may result in injury to the\r\npermanent trees in the orchard.\r\n\r\nTrees used as fillers for apples should have two important\r\ncharacteristics; they should be rapid, vigorous growers and should\r\ncome into bearing at a very early age. Two kinds of fillers are\r\navailable, those of the same species, which may be either dwarf or\r\nstandard trees, and those of a different species, of which peaches and\r\nplums, and possibly pears, are the best adapted. Dwarf trees may be\r\ndismissed from our plans with the statement that they have rarely\r\nproved profitable under ordinary conditions, as they are much more\r\ndifficult to grow than standards and when grown they have but few\r\nadvantages over them. The varieties of standard apples which are\r\nadvisable as fillers have been indicated in Chapter II.\r\n\r\nThe use of peaches and the Japanese plums, both of which make\r\nexcellent fillers because they grow rapidly and come to heavy bearing\r\nquickly, is limited to their soil and climatic adaptation. They are\r\nadapted to the lighter phases of soil and the more moderate climates\r\nand under other conditions are impracticable. On heavier soils and in\r\nmore rigorous climates the European plums and the more rapid and early\r\nbearing pears, such as the Keiffer, make fairly good fillers.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the writer is inclined to advise the use of fillers in\r\nthe general farm orchard. Quicker returns from an investment of this\r\nnature, which is usually heavy and which at best must be put off\r\nseveral years, are very important. Under careful and intelligent\r\nmanagement the objections to their use are easily overcome.\r\n\r\nSPACING AND ARRANGEMENT OF TREES.--The distance apart of planting\r\ndepends on the variety planted. Close headed, upright growing trees\r\nmay be planted closer together than spreading varieties. Some\r\nvarieties grow larger than others, and the same variety may vary in\r\nsize on different soils. It is seldom advisable to plant standard\r\napple trees in the latitude of New York closer than thirty feet, or\r\nfarther apart than fifty feet. Trees of the nature of Twenty Ounce and\r\nOldenburg (Dutchess) should be planted from thirty-two to thirty-six\r\nfeet apart, while Baldwins, Rhode Island Greenings, and Northern Spies\r\nrepresent the other extreme and will require forty, and sometimes\r\nfifty feet of space. The method and thoroughness of pruning influences\r\nthe size of trees greatly, and hence the distance at which It is\r\nnecessary to set them.\r\n\r\nVarieties top worked on other stocks have a tendency to grow more\r\nupright and may be set closer together. It should be remembered in\r\nthis connection that the roots of a tree extend considerably beyond\r\nthe spread of the branches. From thirty-five to forty feet is a good\r\naverage distance and trees should be trained so as to occupy this\r\nspace and no more. Where fillers are used the latter distance is best,\r\nas the twenty feet apart at which the trees will then stand is close\r\nenough for any standard variety.\r\n\r\nRECTANGULAR.--The method of setting or the arrangement of the trees\r\nwill greatly influence the number of trees which may be put upon an\r\nacre and the distance apart of the trees in the row. The most common\r\nmethod in the past has been the regular square or rectangular method,\r\ne.g., trees forty by forty feet, or forty by fifty feet, and rows at\r\nright angles, and this is still preferred by many. It is easy to lay\r\nout an orchard on this plan and there is less liability of making\r\nmistakes. It is best adapted to regular fields with right angle\r\ncorners, especially where the orchard is to be cropped with a regular\r\nrotation. All tillage operations are most easily performed in orchards\r\nset on this plan.\r\n\r\nA slight modification of this arrangement which is often advisable,\r\nespecially where fillers are used, is to set a tree in the center of\r\nthe square. The trees then stand like the five spots of a domino, and\r\nthe shortest distance between trees will be about twenty-seven feet\r\nwhen the trees in the regular rows are forty by forty feet apart. This\r\nplan practically doubles the number of trees which can be set on an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nHEXAGONAL OR TRIANGULAR.--Another method of arrangement of the trees\r\nwhich is becoming more and more popular is the hexagonal or triangular\r\nsystem. More trees can be planted on an acre by this plan than by any\r\nother, it being very economical of space. It makes all adjacent trees\r\nequally distant from each other and is really a system of equilateral\r\ntriangles. This plan is better adapted to small areas and especially\r\nto irregular ones, and should be employed where land is expensive and\r\nculture very intensive. It is more difficult to set an orchard after\r\nthis method without error, and it is open to the objection of\r\ninconvenience in cultural operations. Most people forget that while\r\nthe rows running cornerwise in a rectangular or square field set after\r\nthis plan may be a standard distance apart, yet the right angle rows\r\n(not trees) in which it may be more convenient to work are actually\r\nmuch closer together.\r\n\r\nThe best plan to follow to get the rows of trees straight on a level\r\nfield is what is known as the outside stake method. This plan requires\r\nthe placing of a row of stakes on each of the four sides of the field\r\nwhere the trees are to be set and usually about two rows each way\r\nthrough the middle. For this purpose ordinary building laths are best,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty laths, or three bundles, being required\r\nfor five acres, which is as large a unit as can be set at once by this\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n_First_, determine the distance from the road or fence to the first\r\ntree row, which would be at least eighteen feet to allow for turning\r\nthe teams, and establish base lines on each side of the field at right\r\nangles to each other.\r\n\r\n_Second_, beginning at the given distance from the side of the field,\r\nset up a row of stakes along these base lines at the exact distance\r\napart at which the trees are to be set and about half way between the\r\nfence and the first right angle row. Do the same on all sides of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n_Third_, by sighting across the field from one end stake to the other\r\nthe cross rows of stakes can be set through the middle of the field.\r\nThese should be about six or eight rods apart, and care should be used\r\nto avoid setting them where they will interfere with the sighting of\r\nthe right angle rows. This plan has the great merit of enabling the\r\nentire orchard to be set without moving a stake, as no stake stands\r\nwhere a tree is to be set. If the trees are set exactly where the\r\nsight lines cross at right angles and if all rows are an equal\r\ndistance apart, the rows will be perfectly straight.\r\n\r\nOn rough or rolling land this plan does not work well. Here more\r\nsimple methods, though requiring more time, must be used. Lines drawn\r\nwith a cord or marked across the field with a corn planter answer well\r\nfor small areas. Poles of the right length are often used to good\r\nadvantage. In setting trees after the hexagonal plan an equilateral\r\ntriangle made of light poles or wire is probably best, especially on\r\nsmall rough areas, as it is very accurate, simple, and quite rapid.\r\nSome men prefer to make measurements and set a stake at every point\r\nwhere a tree is to be placed. In these cases a simple device locates\r\nthe original stakes after the hole has been dug. A light board about\r\nsix feet long with a notch in the center and holes with pegs in them\r\nat each end is placed with the notch at the stake. One end is then\r\nswung round and the hole dug. When the end is replaced on its peg the\r\ntree set in the hole should rest in the notch where the original stake\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of trees required per acre at\r\ndifferent distances for the square or rectangular method and for the\r\nhexagonal method.\r\n\r\n             Sq.

This is the great advantage of\r\nthis plan over the square. Filling an orchard one way, i.e., between\r\nthe permanent row, in one direction only, practically doubles the\r\ntrees which can be set on an acre; filling both ways quadruples the\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF SOIL.--The previous condition and treatment of a soil\r\nfor an orchard are important. If the soil has been in a good rotation\r\nof field crops, including some cultivated crops, it should be in prime\r\ncondition for the trees. Old pastures and meadows should be plowed up,\r\ncropped, and cultivated for a year or two before setting to obtain the\r\nbest and quickest results. If one is in a hurry, however, this may be\r\ndone after setting the trees. Good results are sometimes obtained by\r\nsetting trees right among the stumps on recently cleared timberland.\r\nWhere no stiff sod has formed the trees start quickly in the rich\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe best immediate treatment of land preparatory to setting the trees\r\nshould be such as to place the soil in good tilth. Deep plowing,\r\nthorough cultivation, and the application of liberal amounts of\r\nmanure--twelve to fifteen loads per acre--are the most effective means\r\nof doing this. The best crop immediately to precede trees is clover.\r\nSometimes an application of one thousand five hundred to two thousand\r\npounds of lime will help to insure a stand of clover and at the same\r\ntime improve the physical condition of the soil. Fall plowing is a\r\ngood practice on the medium loams and more open soils, but on the\r\nheavy clays spring plowing is to be preferred, as when plowed in the\r\nfall these soils puddle and become hard to handle. Care should always\r\nbe taken to keep the orchard well furrowed out as standing water is\r\ndecidedly inimical to satisfactory tree-growth. Tile draining is\r\nfrequently advisable.\r\n\r\nINTERCROPPING.--The question of intercropping a young orchard is one\r\nto be carefully considered. As it is often practiced it is very\r\ninjurious to the orchard, but it is possible to manage crops so as to\r\nbe of very little harm to the trees. While the practice may be\r\ninadvisable in many commercial orchards, yet on a general farm we\r\nshould by all means think that it was the right thing to do. Certain\r\nfacts must be remembered, however, which have a bearing on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nTrees are a crop, as much as corn or grass. If we grow a crop between\r\nthe tree rows we must remember that we are double cropping the land\r\nand that it must be fed and cared for accordingly. There is absolutely\r\nno use in setting an apple orchard, expecting it to take care of\r\nitself, \"just growing,\" like Topsy, as numerous dilapidated and broken\r\ndown orchards bear ample testimony. If orchards are to be cropped\r\nthis must be judiciously done with the trees primarily in mind.\r\n\r\nThe best crops to grow in a young apple orchard are those requiring\r\ncultivation, or which permit the cultivation of the land early in the\r\nseason. Field beans, potatoes, and garden truck of all kinds, as small\r\nvegetables, melons, etc., are among the very best crops to grow in the\r\nyoung orchard. Corn will do if it does not shade the trees too much.\r\nSmall grain and grass should not be used, especially where they come\r\nup close to the trees. These crops form too stiff a sod and use up too\r\nmuch moisture. A mulch of straw, cut grass, or coarse manure will help\r\nto correct this condition somewhat when these crops must be used.\r\nAfter cultivation until midsummer buckwheat makes a satisfactory\r\norchard crop in some cases.\r\n\r\nA regular rotation may be used in the young orchard to advantage when\r\na space is left next the trees to receive cultivation. This space\r\nshould be at least two feet on each side of the tree the first year\r\nand should be widened each year as the tree grows older and larger, to\r\nfour, six, and eight feet. This method has been used by the author\r\nvery successfully for a number of years. Some good rotations to use\r\nin a growing orchard are: (1) Wheat or rye one year, clover one year,\r\nbeans or potatoes one year; (2) oats one year, clover one year,\r\npotatoes one year; (3) beans one year, rye plowed under in spring,\r\nfollowed by any cultivated crop one or two years. The essentials of a\r\ngood rotation for an orchard are: A humus and fertility supplying\r\ncrop, preferably clover, in the north, and cow peas in the south, and\r\nat least two crops in four requiring cultivation up to the middle of\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\nMost of the points regarding the management of young trees have\r\nalready been mentioned, but a few others should have attention\r\ndirected to them. Fall planted trees should not be cut back until\r\nspring. In the spring all newly planted trees should have their tops\r\ncut back rather severely to correspond with the injury to the roots in\r\ntransplanting, thus preserving the balance between root and top. This\r\nwill usually be about half to two-thirds the previous season's growth.\r\nFrom three to five well distributed branches should be left with which\r\nto form the top. During the first few years of their lives the young\r\napple trees will need little or no pruning, except to shape them and\r\nremove crossing or interfering branches.\r\n\r\nConstant cultivation at frequent intervals until midsummer should be\r\nthe rule with young growing trees, with which this is even more\r\nimportant than with older trees. It is a good plan to plow the orchard\r\nin fall where possible, always turning the furrows toward the trees,\r\nleaving the dead furrows as drainage ditches between the rows. At\r\nBeechwood Farm we have always banked the trees with earth in the fall,\r\nusing a shovel. This not only firms the soil about the tree, holding\r\nit straight and strong through the winter, but it affords good\r\nprotection against rodents, especially mice. Where rabbits are\r\nprevalent it is well to place a fine mesh wire netting around the\r\ntrees in addition to this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPRUNING THE TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nPruning is not an entirely artificial operation as one might at first\r\nthought suppose. It is one of nature's most common processes. Nature\r\naccomplishes this result through the principle of competition, by\r\nstarting many more trees on a given area than can possibly survive. In\r\nthe same way there is a surplus of buds and branches on each\r\nindividual tree. It is only by the crowding out and the perishing of\r\nmany buds, branches, and trees that others are enabled to reach\r\nmaturity and fulfill their purpose. This being too slow and too\r\nexpensive a process for him, man accomplishes in a day with the knife\r\nand saw what nature is years in doing by crowding, shading, and\r\ncompetition. Proper pruning is really an improvement on nature's\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nNeither is it true, as some claim, that pruning is a devitalizing\r\nprocess. On the contrary it is often stimulating and may actually\r\nincrease the vigor of a weak or declining tree. All practical\r\nexperience teaches us that pruning is a reasonable, necessary, and\r\nadvantageous process. True, it is often overdone, and improperly done.\r\nAs in many other things, certain fundamental principles underlie and\r\nshould govern practice. When these are known and observed, pruning\r\nbecomes a more simple matter.\r\n\r\nHeavy pruning during the dormant or winter season stimulates the\r\ngrowth and tends to increase the production of wood. In the same way\r\npruning during the summer or growing season stimulates the growth and\r\ntends to induce fruitfulness, if the tree remains healthy. But this\r\nfruitfulness is apt to be at the expense of the vigor of the tree. On\r\nthe other hand, the pruning of the roots of a tree tends to check the\r\ngrowth of wood, the same as poor feeding. As above noted heading back\r\na tree when dormant tends to stimulate it to a more vigorous growth.\r\n\r\nThe habit of growth of a variety has much to do with its pruning. Some\r\nvarieties of apples are upright, others are spreading growers. Climate\r\nand locality greatly affect these habits of growth. So also the habit\r\nof a young tree often differs from the habit of the same tree in old\r\nage. The tendency is for a tree to continue its growth from its\r\nuppermost or terminal buds. Although the heading in of new growth\r\nchecks this upward tendency and throws the energy of the tree into the\r\ndevelopment of lateral and dormant buds, nevertheless the pruned tree\r\nsoon resumes its natural upward growing habit.\r\n\r\nPlant food is taken up by the minute tree rootlets in solution and\r\ncarried to the leaves where it is elaborated and then returned for use\r\nto the growing tissues of the tree. Whenever there is any obstruction\r\nabove a bud the tendency is to throw the energy of the branch into a\r\nlateral bud, but if the obstruction is below the bud the branch merely\r\nthickens and growth is checked. When too heavy pruning is practiced\r\nthe balance between the roots and top is disturbed. This usually\r\nresults in what are commonly known as \"suckers.\" These are caused by\r\nan abnormal condition and while they may be the result of disease or\r\ninjury to the tree, they are often of great value in restoring or\r\nreadjusting the proper balance between the roots and top.\r\n\r\nPruning a tree is a way of thinning the fruit and a good one. It may\r\nsometimes be used to influence the bearing year of trees like the\r\nBaldwin, which have an alternate bearing habit, but this is a more\r\ntheoretical than practical method. Fruit bearing is determined more by\r\nthe habitual performance of the tree than by any method of pruning,\r\nand this is especially true of old trees. It is easier to influence\r\nyoung trees. Conditions which tend to produce heavy wood growth are\r\nunfavorable for the formation and development of fruit buds. A\r\nquiescent state is a better condition for this.\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR PRUNING.--With these fundamental principles in mind we may\r\nsafely outline a method of pruning an apple tree. As the desired end\r\nis different so will the method of pruning a young tree differ from\r\nthat of an old one. There are five important things for which to prune\r\na young tree, namely:\r\n\r\n1. To preserve a proper balance between the top and root at the time\r\nof setting out. This usually means cutting off the broken and the very\r\nlong roots to a reasonable length and cutting back from one-half to\r\ntwo-thirds of the growth of the previous season.\r\n\r\n2. To make the top open in order to admit the sunlight freely. In the\r\nhumid climate of the Northeastern States, it is usually advisable to\r\nprune a tree so as to have a rather open top. This is necessary in\r\norder properly to color and mature the fruit.\r\n\r\n3. To regulate the number of limbs composing the top. Probably three\r\nbranches well distributed on the trunk would make most nearly the\r\nideal head, but as these cannot always be obtained the best practice\r\nis to leave from three to five branches from which to form the top.\r\n\r\n4. To fix the branches at the proper height from the ground. This is\r\nmore or less a matter of opinion, some growers preferring a low and\r\nothers a high head. The character of the tree growth, the method of\r\nculture, and the purpose of the tree whether temporary or permanent\r\ngreatly influence the height of the head. An upright growing variety\r\nshould be headed lower than a spreading one. Trees kept in sod or\r\nunder extensive methods can well be headed lower than those under more\r\nintensive culture where it is desirable to carry on cultural\r\noperations close around them. Permanent trees should be headed higher\r\nthan temporary trees. Apple trees should seldom be headed lower than a\r\nfoot from the ground, nor more than four feet above it. For upright\r\ngrowing varieties intended as permanents, the writer prefers three to\r\nthree and one-half feet and for more spreading varieties four feet;\r\nwhile for temporary trees eighteen inches should be a good height.\r\n\r\n5. To do away with weak crotches and to remove crossing or interfering\r\nbranches. A crotch formed by two branches of equal size, especially\r\nwhen the split is deep, is a weak crotch and should be avoided. Strong\r\ncrotches are formed by forcing the development of lateral buds and\r\nmaking almost a right angle branch from the parent one. All branches\r\nwhich rub each other, which tend to occupy the same space with\r\nanother, or which generally seem out of place, are better removed as\r\nsoon as any of these tendencies are found to exist.\r\n\r\nIDEALS IN PRUNING.--The general method of pruning the old trees and\r\nthe ideal in mind for it will also influence the pruning of the young\r\ntree, especially the shaping of it. Once determined upon, the ideal\r\nshould be consistently followed out in the pruning of the tree as it\r\nbecomes older. As the tree comes to bearing age it will be necessary\r\nto prune somewhat differently and for other purposes. These we can\r\nconveniently consider under six heads:\r\n\r\n1. Every tree should be pruned with a definite ideal as to size,\r\nshape, and degree of openness in mind. To have such an ideal is very\r\nimportant. It is only by industriously and consistently carrying it\r\nout that the ideal tree in these respects can be ever obtained.\r\nHaphazard cutting and sawing without a definite purpose in mind are\r\nreally worse than no pruning at all.\r\n\r\n2. It almost goes without saying that to remove all dead, diseased, or\r\ninjured wood is a prime purpose of pruning. Dead and injured branches\r\nopen the way for rot and decay of contiguous branches, and disease\r\nspreads through the tree. The removal of all such branches is as\r\nessential to the health of the tree as it is to its good appearance.\r\nIn removing them the cut should be made well behind the diseased or\r\ninjured part to insure the checking of rot and disease.\r\n\r\n3. All mature apple trees should be so pruned as to keep them in the\r\nmost easily manageable shape and to facilitate in every possible way\r\nthe operations of tillage, spraying, and harvesting. It is most\r\nimportant to have the tree low enough down so that spraying and\r\npicking can be easily done. It is difficult to spray properly a tree\r\nwhich is more than twenty-five feet in height. Even this height\r\nnecessitates a tower on the spray rig and the use of an extension\r\npole. An apple tree should be so pruned that all the fruit can be\r\nreadily picked from ladders not longer than eighteen to twenty-two\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the tree has been allowed to get higher than this under\r\nprevious management, sometimes we have to make the best of a bad\r\nsituation. If the trees are too high head them back by cutting off the\r\nleaders, but it is not always wise to lower all trees to twenty-two\r\nfeet. Heading back of old trees will be more fully discussed in the\r\nchapter on \"Renovating Old Orchards.\" Ladders longer than twenty-two\r\nfeet are heavy and clumsy to handle.\r\n\r\nIf cultivation is to be carried on close up under the tree the lower\r\nlimbs must be pruned so as to allow this. It is not necessary,\r\nhowever, to drive a team closer than twelve or fifteen feet from a\r\nmature tree, contrary to the common belief and practice. Cultivation\r\nis least important in the first few feet of space around a mature\r\ntree. By the use of set-over tools, all that is necessary can be well\r\ncultivated without crowding the team under or against the branches.\r\n\r\n4. As has been pointed out in the discussion of the pruning of young\r\ntrees, in humid regions where the sunlight is none too abundant\r\nthrough the growing season, the open head is most desirable. Sunlight\r\non the leaves as well as on the fruit is essential to good color of\r\nthe fruit, and good color is a very important factor in the flavor and\r\nattractive appearance of the fruit. An open center with upright\r\ngrowing leaders removed gives the greatest opportunity for sunlight to\r\npenetrate through the tree.\r\n\r\n5. As we have seen, pruning in the dormant season tends to increase\r\nthe vigor of the tree. Thus winter pruning serves to secure a normal\r\nand vigorous wood growth, which is most essential to a healthy\r\nfruit-bearing tree. On the other hand, such pruning may be excessive\r\nand produce wood growth at the expense of fruit buds, throwing the\r\ntree out of bearing.\r\n\r\n6. The sixth and last reason for pruning is to regulate the number and\r\ndistribution of the wood and the fruit bearing buds. The proper\r\nbalance between these is greatly affected by pruning and can be best\r\nregulated by experience with the particular tree or variety. A perfect\r\nbalance is hard to get, but with study and skill it can be closely\r\napproximated. Pruning, too, may thin the fruit, as removing branches\r\nremoves fruit buds. This is best done by removing small branches near\r\nthe ends of larger ones. It is a much cheaper method of thinning than\r\npicking off individual fruits, but not as effective.\r\n\r\nTIME OF PRUNING.--The particular time of the year for pruning is not\r\nvital. As between summer and winter pruning, winter is to be preferred\r\nbecause of the physical effect on the tree. Summer pruning is an\r\nunnatural process and should only be practiced as a last resort to\r\ncheck growth or induce fruitfulness, as it may result in injury to the\r\ntree. It is essential that a tree mature its foliage, which it\r\nfrequently does not do after summer pruning. Diseased, dead, or\r\ninjured wood should be removed when first observed, summer or winter.\r\n\r\nSpring is the logical and usually the most convenient time to prune on\r\nthe general farm. While dormant season pruning may be done at any\r\ntime between November 1st and June 1st, the cuts heal more rapidly in\r\nthe spring when the sap begins to flow. In regions subject to severe\r\nand drying winds in the winter, pruning should be deferred at least to\r\nlate winter. Considered from every standpoint, March and April are\r\nquite the best months in which to prune. After the removal of useless\r\nbranches, the normal amount of food material is delivered to fewer\r\nbuds under greater sap pressure and the remaining buds are made more\r\nstrong and vigorous.\r\n\r\nIn removing small branches with a knife or other cutting tool, the cut\r\nshould be made upward from below and opposite a bud. On upright\r\ngrowing varieties the last bud left should be an outside one to induce\r\nthe tree to spread as much as possible, while on spreading trees\r\nleaving as the last bud an inside one has a tendency to make the tree\r\ngrow more upright. Always cut close to the parent branch, never\r\nleaving a stub no matter how young or old the tree.\r\n\r\nCuts of lateral branches should be made just at the shoulder of the\r\nbranch where it joins the parent. A cut behind the shoulder will not\r\nheal, neither will one too far ahead of it. A stub left on a trunk or\r\nlarge branch does not heal, but soon begins to rot at the end where\r\nthe heartwood is exposed. This gradually works back into the main\r\nbranch and the tree finally becomes \"rotten at the heart.\" All that is\r\nneeded to complete the destruction is a heavy wind, an ice or a snow\r\nstorm, or a heavy load of fruit.\r\n\r\nAll wounds more than two inches in diameter should be painted either\r\nwith a heavy lead paint, which is preferable, or with some gas tar\r\npreparation. These things do not in themselves heal a cut, but they\r\nkeep out the decaying elements, air and moisture, thus helping to\r\npreserve the branch and by protecting it to promote healing in\r\nnature's way. A little lamp black will serve to deaden the color of\r\nthe paint.\r\n\r\nPRUNING TOOLS.--The best tool to use in pruning is one which brings\r\nyou nearest to your work and over which you have the greatest control\r\nto make all kinds of cuts. In the writer's experience no tool does\r\nthis so smoothly and conveniently as a properly shaped saw. A good saw\r\nshould be quite rigid, rather heavy at the butt, where its depth\r\nshould be about six inches, tapering down to about two inches at the\r\npoint. It should have a full, firm grip, be not more than thirty\r\ninches long, and should always be kept sharp. Two-edged saws should\r\nnot be used because of the injury done to the tree when sawing in\r\ncrotches.\r\n\r\nCutting shears are often very useful, especially the smaller,\r\none-handed type which is almost indispensable in pruning young trees.\r\nThe larger, two-handled shears are useful in thinning out the ends of\r\nbranches or in heading back new growth. They should not be too heavy,\r\nas they are tiresome to use. The extension handled types are too\r\ncumbersome, too slow to work with, and the operator is of necessity\r\ntoo far away from his work for the best results.\r\n\r\nFRUIT THINNING.--A matter which is quite nearly related to pruning is\r\nthinning the fruit, and may properly be treated here. That this is not\r\nas common a practice with most fruit-growers as it should be, the\r\ngreat lack of uniformity in our ordinary market apples is ample\r\nevidence. Many persons will at once raise the question as to whether\r\nor not it is practicable to thin the fruit on large apple trees. The\r\nanswer is that many growers find it not only practicable, but most\r\nprofitable to do so. Wherever fruit of a uniform size and color is\r\ndesired, thinning is a practical necessity, especially when the crop\r\nof fruit is heavy.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to thin the fruit is just after what is commonly known\r\nas the \"June drop,\" i.e., the falling off of those fruits not well\r\nenough pollinated or set to hold on to maturity. In thinning the fruit\r\nshould be taken off until they are not closer than from four to six\r\ninches apart on the same branch, although the distance apart on any\r\nbranch will depend somewhat on the amount of the crop on other parts\r\nof the tree. Never leave clusters of fruit on any branches, as some of\r\nthem are sure to be small and out of shape. Furthermore two apples\r\nlying together afford a fine place for worms to get from one apple to\r\nanother and they seldom fail to improve the opportunity. Step ladders\r\nand ordinary rung ladders are used to get at the fruit for thinning.\r\nThe cost of the operation is not nearly as large as might appear at\r\nfirst thought and in practically all cases is a paying investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION AND COVER CROPPING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its broad sense cultivation is the treatment of the soil. Thus\r\nunderstood orchard cultivation includes the sod mulch system as well\r\nas the stirring of the soil with various implements. In its more\r\ncommon and restricted meaning, however, cultivation is the stirring of\r\nthe soil about plants to encourage growth and productivity. To have\r\nthe apple tree in sod was once the commonly accepted method of orchard\r\ntreatment--a method of neglect and of \"letting well enough alone.\"\r\nWith the advent of more scientific apple culture the stirring of the\r\nsoil has come to be the more popular method. But within the last few\r\nyears an improved modification of the old sod method, known as the sod\r\n\"mulch\" system, has attracted much attention because of the success\r\nwith which a few men have practiced it. For a correct understanding of\r\nthese practices and of the relative desirability of these systems we\r\nmust again turn to underlying principles and purposes.\r\n\r\nIt may be said on first thought that tillage is a practice contrary to\r\nnature. But it accomplishes what nature does in another way. Tillage\r\nhas been practiced on other crops than trees for so long that we think\r\nof it almost as a custom. There are, however, scientific and practical\r\nreasons for tillage.\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF TILLAGE on the soil are three fold, physical, chemical,\r\nand increasing of water holding capacity. Tillage affects the soil\r\nphysically by fining and deepening it, thus increasing the feeding\r\narea of roots, and by bringing about the more free admission of air\r\nwarms and dries the soil, thus reducing extremes of temperature and\r\nmoisture. Chemical activities are augmented by tillage in setting free\r\nplant food, promoting nutrification, hastening the decomposition of\r\norganic matter, and the extending of these agencies to greater depth.\r\nTillage conserves moisture by increasing the water holding capacity of\r\nthe soil and by checking evaporation.\r\n\r\nOf all these things which tillage accomplishes in a soil, two should\r\nbe especially emphasized for the apple orchard, namely, soil moisture\r\nand soil texture. That moisture is a very important consideration in\r\nthe apple orchard the effects of our frequent droughts are ample\r\nevidence. The amount of rainfall in the Eastern States when it is\r\nproperly distributed is fully sufficient for the needs of an apple\r\ntree. By enlarging the reservoir or water holding capacity of the soil\r\nand by preventing the loss of water by evaporation, an excess of\r\nrainfall in the spring may be held for later distribution and use.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the improvement of a poor soil texture is as effective as\r\nthe supplying of plant food and much cheaper. The latter is of no\r\nconsequence unless the plant can use it. Scientists tell us that there\r\nis an abundance of plant food in most soils. The problem is to make it\r\navailable. Plant food must be in solution and in the form of a film\r\nmoisture surrounding the smallest soil particles in order to be\r\navailable to the fine plant rootlets which seek it. Good tillage\r\nsupplies these conditions. Can they be obtained equally well in\r\nanother way?\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the advocates of the sod mulch system of orchard\r\nculture that it also supplies these conditions. Humus or decayed\r\nvegetable matter holds moisture. Grass or other mulch decaying in the\r\nsoil increases its humus content and hence its water holding capacity.\r\nBy forming a mulch over the soil evaporation may be checked to some\r\nextent, although probably not as effectively in a practical way, as by\r\ncultivation. If there is a good grass sod in the orchard, moisture and\r\nplant food made available by that moisture are utilized, and if the\r\ngrass is allowed to go back into the soil it continues to furnish\r\nthese elements to the tree. But there is a rapid evaporation of\r\nmoisture from the surface of the leaves of grass. In fact, grass may\r\nwell serve to remove an excess of moisture in wet seasons, or from wet\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nLaying aside theoretical considerations, let us see what practical\r\nexperience teaches on this subject. We have the accurate data on a\r\nlarge number of western New York orchards showing the results of\r\ncultivation and other methods of soil management. These data are\r\noverwhelmingly in the favor of cultivation. In Wayne County the\r\naverage yield of orchards tilled for five years or more was 271\r\nbushels per acre, as compared with 200 bushels per acre for those in\r\nsod five years or more but otherwise well cared for,--an increase of\r\nthirty-five per cent. in favor of good tillage. In Orleans County,\r\nunder the same conditions, the increase in yield due to cultivation\r\nwas forty-five per cent. and in Niagara County it was twenty-two per\r\ncent. Records were made on hundreds of orchards and the results should\r\nbe given great weight in determining the system to be practiced, as\r\nintelligent consideration of trustworthy records is to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nThese results were obtained in one region under its conditions and it\r\nis quite possible, although not probable, that other conditions might\r\ngive different results. There are, however, special conditions as will\r\nbe pointed out later, under which the sod mulch method might be more\r\nadvisable than tillage. It is cheaper, makes a cleaner cover for the\r\ndrop fruit, avoids the damage from tillage implements to which tilled\r\ntrees are liable, and can be practiced on lands too steep to till. It\r\noften happens, too, that it fits into the scheme of management on a\r\ngeneral farm better than the more intensive and specialized system of\r\ncultivation. And it must be remembered that we are dealing with this\r\nquestion from the point of view of the home farm rather than of the\r\ncommercial orchardist. So that where the sod mulch gives equally good\r\nresults it would be preferred under these conditions.\r\n\r\nLATE FALL AND EARLY SPRING PLOWING.--The common tillage practice in\r\nthe sections where it is most followed is to plow either in late fall\r\nor as early as possible in the spring. Whether fall or spring plowing\r\nis best depends on two things: the character of the soil and\r\nconvenience. On heavy clay soils where drainage is poor it is not\r\nadvisable to plow in the fall as the soil is apt to puddle and then to\r\nbake when it dries, making it hard to handle. On gravel loams, medium\r\nloams, and all well drained soils which are fairly open in texture\r\neither fall or spring plowing is practiced depending on which period\r\naffords the most time.\r\n\r\nOn the general farm where there are several crops for which the land\r\nmust be prepared in spring, it would seem best to get as much of the\r\nplowing as possible done in the fall. But a large crop of apples or a\r\nlarge and late corn husking or potato digging may interfere with this\r\non some farms and make spring plowing more desirable. Always plan this\r\nwork in connection with the other farm work so as to give the best\r\ndistribution of labor.\r\n\r\nAfter fall plowing either the spring-tooth harrow or the disk harrow\r\nis best to use to work up the soil and no time should be lost in\r\ngetting at this as soon as the land is dry enough in the spring.\r\nSometimes the disk harrow can be used to work up the soil in the\r\norchard in the spring without any plowing at all, especially on loose\r\nloams where there are few stones. But on newly plowed land a disk cuts\r\ntoo deep and there is too great danger of injuring the roots. On\r\nspring plowed land the spring-tooth harrow usually gives the best\r\nresults. After the soil is thoroughly fined and worked into a mellow\r\nbed and as soon as the period of excessive moisture in spring is\r\npassed, a lighter implement like the smoothing harrow or a light\r\nshallow digging cultivator should be used to stir the surface of the\r\nsoil only.\r\n\r\nThe growing period for an apple tree begins as early as growth starts\r\nin the spring and continues up to about midsummer. If cultivation is\r\nto stimulate growth as much as possible, it should be done during this\r\nperiod. The first object of cultivation in the early spring is to\r\nloosen up, aerate, and dry out the soil, which is usually too wet at\r\nthat time. As cultivation is continued the soil will become fined and\r\nfirmed again by the time drier weather comes on. A fairly deep\r\ndigging and lump crushing tool is the best implement to use up to this\r\ntime, and a disk or spring-tooth harrow meets these requirements.\r\n\r\nAfter this period is passed and during drier weather, cultivation is\r\ncarried on for a different purpose, namely, to conserve moisture by\r\nmaking a thin dust mulch of soil over the surface. This is best\r\naccomplished by shallow-going implements of which the spike-tooth\r\nharrow, the acme harrow, or a light wheel cultivator are best. As the\r\nseason and the amount of rainfall vary, so must tillage operations be\r\nvaried. In an early dry season begin with the lighter implements\r\nearlier. In a late wet season keep the digging tools at work later. As\r\nsoon as the soil is in good physical condition the principal object of\r\ntillage is to modify moisture conditions.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of practice three to four harrowings at intervals of a\r\nweek to ten days are necessary. Sometimes more, sometimes less are\r\nrequired, according to the character and condition of the soil and the\r\nseason. The later moisture-conserving tillage should also be carried\r\non every week or ten days, according to weather conditions. It is good\r\npractice to stir the soil after every heavy or moderately heavy rain.\r\nUse the smoothing tools after light to medium rains and the heavier\r\ntools after packing or beating rains. In practice from five to eight\r\nor ten of these cultivations are necessary. The drier the season the\r\nmore necessary does frequent cultivation become.\r\n\r\nA COVER CROP is so closely associated with tillage that it is usually\r\nconsidered a part of the system. It should be sown in midsummer as soon\r\nas tillage ceases. This time will vary from July first to August\r\nfifteenth, depending on the locality, the rainfall, the crop of fruit\r\non the trees, and on how favorable the conditions for securing a good\r\nstand of the cover crop are. The farther south the locality, or the\r\nearlier the fruit, the sooner the crop should be sown. Absence of\r\nsufficient rainfall necessitates a continuation of the cultivation,\r\nboth because it is necessary to conserve all the moisture possible and\r\nbecause it is difficult to get a good stand of a cover crop--especially\r\nof one having small seeds--at a dry time in midsummer.\r\n\r\nIn a year when there is a full crop of fruit on the trees cultivation\r\nshould be continued as late as possible as all the stimulus that can\r\nthus be secured will be necessary to help the fruit attain good size\r\nand maturity, and at the same time enable the tree properly to mature\r\nits fruit and leaf buds for the following year. On the other hand, in\r\na year when there is not a full crop of fruit cultivation should be\r\nstopped early so as to avoid forcing a too rank growth of wood and\r\nfoliage and continuing the growth of the next season's buds so late\r\nthat they may not mature and therefore may be in danger of winter\r\nkilling.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of cover crops which may be used in the apple\r\norchard will be considered in the next chapter as they are so closely\r\nassociated with fertilization. Strictly speaking, however, a cover\r\ncrop is used principally to secure its mulching and physical effects\r\non the soil in the intervals between the seasons of tillage. In\r\naddition to its physical and feeding effects the cover crop serves to\r\ncheck the growth of trees in the latter part of the season by taking\r\nup the nitrates and a part of the moisture, thus helping to ripen the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nSOD MULCH.--The ordinary sod culture which is practiced in so many\r\norchards should not be confused with the sod mulch system. The one is\r\na system of neglect, the other of intention. In the sod mulch system\r\nthe grass sod is stimulated and encouraged and when the grass dies or\r\nis cut, it is left on the ground to decay, forming a soil mulch\r\nmeanwhile. The removal of grass from the orchard as hay is poor\r\npractice and should be discouraged. The grass mulch may well be\r\nsupplemented by the addition of other grass, straw, leaves, coarse\r\nmanure, or other similar materials. Sometimes this mulch is put on to\r\nthe depth of six inches or even a foot around the tree. Thus practiced\r\nit is very effective in conserving moisture and in adding the humus\r\nwhich is so necessary to the soil.\r\n\r\nSod and tillage have somewhat different effects on the tree and on the\r\nfruit. Let us see what these effects are. It is common knowledge that\r\nfruit is more highly colored when grown in sod than when grown under a\r\ntillage system. This is probably largely due to the fact that tillage\r\nkeeps the fruit growing so late that it does not mature so well or so\r\nearly. Fruit is usually two or three weeks later in tilled than in sod\r\norchards. It has been shown that fruit grown under tillage keeps from\r\ntwo to four weeks longer than that grown in sod. It is claimed\r\nalso--but this is a disputed point--that tilled fruit has a better\r\nquality and flavor. Certain it is that fruit grown in sod is drier\r\nand less crisp and juicy.\r\n\r\nThe effect of tillage on the trees is more marked and better known.\r\nTilled trees have a darker, richer green foliage, indicating a better\r\nand more vigorous health. The leaves are also larger and more\r\nnumerous. They come out three or four days earlier in the spring and\r\nstay on the trees two weeks later in the fall than the leaves on trees\r\nkept in sod. Tilled trees make nearly twice the growth in a season\r\nthat those in sod do, in fact there is danger of their making wood\r\ngrowth at the expense of fruit buds. Tillage also gives a deeper,\r\nbetter distributed root system.\r\n\r\nDespite the advantages and the disadvantages of each system, there are\r\ntimes, places, and circumstances under which one is more advisable\r\nthan the other. On lands rich in humus and in plant food and level so\r\nas to be easily tillable, cultivation is without doubt the best\r\nsystem. But it should be practiced in connection with cover crops, and\r\nthe orchard should be given occasional periods of rest in sod--say one\r\nyear in from three to five.\r\n\r\nThe sod mulch system of orchard culture is probably better adapted to\r\nrather wet good grass land and where mulching material is cheap and\r\nreadily available. It is undoubtedly at its best on lands too steep or\r\nrough to till, or otherwise unsuitable to cultivation. Tillage is the\r\nmore intensive method and where labor is scarce and high sod culture\r\nmight be more advisable for this reason, other conditions being not\r\ntoo unfavorable.\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate a method of management under the tillage system\r\nwe may suggest the following as a good one for level to gently rolling\r\nland:\r\n\r\n   1912. Early plowing in spring, cultivation to July first to\r\n         fifteenth. Then sow red clover as a cover crop.\r\n\r\n   1913. Repeat previous year's treatment, varying the time of\r\n         sowing cover crop according to conditions.\r\n\r\n   1914. Let the clover grow, mowing and leaving on the ground as a\r\n         mulch, June fifteenth to twentieth, and again in August.\r\n\r\n   1915. Plow early in spring, cultivate to midsummer, and then sow\r\n         rye or buckwheat as a cover crop July fifteenth to August\r\n         fifteenth.\r\n\r\n   1916. Repeat 1915 treatment and if trees are not growing too\r\n         fast, sow clover or hairy vetch as a cover crop.\r\n\r\n   1917. Same as 1912, etc.\r\n\r\nPASTURING THE ORCHARD.--The sod mulch system explains itself and does\r\nnot need illustration. Sod orchards are often managed as pasture for\r\nanimals, however, and this practice should be discussed. An orchard is\r\nconsidered as pastured when a considerable number of animals are\r\nturned into it for a greater or less portion of the year. Results in\r\norchards where pasturage has been thoroughly tried out show that it is\r\nnever advisable to pasture an orchard with horses or cattle, but that\r\nfairly good results may be expected where sheep or hogs are used.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of yield of fruit and appearance of trees both indicate,\r\nthat pasturing an orchard with horses or cattle is about the worst\r\npossible practice. These animals rub against the trees, break the\r\nbranches, browse the limbs and leaves, and destroy the fruit as high\r\nas they can reach. All experience is against this practice which\r\ncannot be too strongly deprecated.\r\n\r\nPasturing an orchard with sheep, although a somewhat doubtful\r\npractice, often gives good results. Sheep crop the grass close to the\r\nground and to some extent prevent the extensive evaporation which\r\nusually takes place from the leaves of grass. Their well distributed\r\nmanure is worth considerable. They also browse the branches to some\r\nextent and should not be allowed to run in the orchard late in the\r\nseason as they will destroy considerable fruit.\r\n\r\nPasturing an orchard with swine gives better results than any other\r\npasture treatment of the orchard. Hogs do considerable rooting which\r\nprevents the formation of a stiff sod and itself may often amount\r\nalmost to cultivation in well stocked orchards. A good deal of manure\r\nis added to the soil, especially when the hogs are fed outside the\r\norchard. Hogs also destroy many insects by eating the wormy fruit.\r\n\r\nPasturage of orchards has its advantages. It gives a double\r\nutilization of the land. It is a cheap method of management. When the\r\nanimals are fed outside the orchard, as should always be the case, it\r\nadds considerable plant food to the soil. When plenty of outside food\r\ncan be given and when the orchard is not overstocked--the animals\r\nshould never be hungry--hogs and sheep may be used to advantage in\r\npasturing orchards. In very rough fields incapable of tillage, this is\r\nundoubtedly the very best system of orchard management.\r\n\r\nPasturage has the disadvantage of exposing young trees to injury from\r\nthe animals, but this may be at least partly avoided by protecting\r\nthem with stakes or a heavy wire meshed screen. Hogs especially soil\r\nthe fruit and make the land rough and difficult to drive over. Under\r\nthe proper conditions pasturage may be practiced to advantage,\r\nespecially on small areas and on the general farm where it is more\r\nadvantageous than it would be commercially.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMANURING AND FERTILIZING\r\n\r\n\r\nCover crops may be said to be supplementary to tillage. In the\r\nprevious chapter this function has been discussed. It now remains to\r\npoint out another important function--that of a green manure crop\r\nadding humus and plant food to the soil. Not only do some cover crops\r\nadd plant food and all humus to the soil, but they tend to conserve\r\nthese by preventing leaching, especially of nitrates, and they help to\r\nrender plant food more available by reworking it and leaving it in a\r\nform more available for the tree. They sometimes act as a protection\r\nagainst winter injury by holding snow and by their own bulk. They also\r\nhelp to dry out the soil in spring, thus making the land tillable\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nThere are two great classes of cover or green manure crops, leguminous\r\nand non-leguminous. A non-leguminous crop merely adds humus and\r\nimproves the physical condition of the soil. In itself it adds no\r\nplant food, although it may take up, utilize, and leave behind plant\r\nfood in a more available form for the tree's use. But in addition to\r\nthese benefits, leguminous crops actually add to the soil plant food\r\nin the form of nitrogen which they have the ability to assimilate from\r\nthe air by means of bacterial organisms on their roots.\r\n\r\nNON-LEGUMINOUS CROPS.--The most important of the non-leguminous crops\r\nare rye, buckwheat, turnips or rape, barley, oats, and millet. The\r\nfirst mentioned are the most commonly used. Also in order of\r\nimportance the following are the usual leguminous cover and green\r\nmanure crops to be used: clovers, winter vetch, soy beans, alfalfa,\r\ncow peas (first in the South). In order to determine the relative\r\nadvisability of the use of these various crops let us now look at some\r\nof their characteristics and requirements.\r\n\r\nRye is one of the best non-leguminous cover crops, especially in the\r\nyoung orchard, as it does not grow as well in shade as in the open. A\r\nparticularly strong point about rye is that it grows rapidly quite\r\nlate in the fall and starts early in the spring. Starting earlier than\r\nmost crops in the spring, it makes a considerable amount of growth\r\nbefore the land is fit to plow. Especially in warmer climates rye\r\nshould not be sown too early in the fall--not usually before September\r\n1st--because of this too heavy growth. Rye is also adapted to a great\r\nvariety of soils and hence will often grow where other crops will not\r\ndo well. About two bushels of seed are required per acre.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat is probably about equally as good as rye for an orchard\r\ncover crop, although it does not produce quite as much organic matter.\r\nIt will germinate at almost any season of the year even if it is very\r\ndry. It is a great soil improver because of its ability to feed and\r\nthrive on soils too poor for other crops, due to its numerous shallow\r\nfeeding rootlets. It grows rapidly and covers the ground well, but\r\nlike rye does not thrive as well in shade. Buckwheat should not be\r\nused to excess on the heavier types of soil as it is rather hard on\r\nthe land. One bushel of seed to an acre makes a good seeding.\r\n\r\nTurnips or rape often make good pioneer cover or green manure crops.\r\nThey are great soil improvement crops and it is comparatively easy to\r\nsecure a good stand of them even in dry weather. Sown in late July in\r\nthe North they will produce a great bulk of humus and add much\r\nmoisture to the soil, especially if they cover the ground well. Their\r\nbroad, abundant leaves and high tops also hold the snow well in\r\nwinter. Cow Horn is the best variety of turnips to use, as it is a\r\nlarge, rank grower. Use one to two pounds of seed to the acre. Rape\r\nmakes an excellent pasture crop in an orchard both for sheep and hogs,\r\nbut especially for the former. Eight or nine pounds of seed are\r\nnecessary to the acre.\r\n\r\nBarley, oats, and millet are not as good crops as the foregoing,\r\nbecause, with the possible exception of millet, they make their best\r\ngrowth early in the season. Moreover they take up too much moisture\r\nfrom the soil at a time when the tree most needs this moisture. In\r\nfact they are sometimes used for this specific purpose on wet land in\r\ntoo wet seasons. Two to two and one half bushels of oats or barley and\r\none to one and one half bushels of millet to the acre are necessary\r\nfor a good seeding.\r\n\r\nAlthough weeds can hardly be classified as cover crops, they are often\r\nvaluable ones. They grow rapidly and rank, making a large bulk of\r\nhumus, without the expense of seeding. If they are not allowed to go\r\nto seed so as to scatter the seed about the farm, they often make the\r\nbest of cover crops. This necessitates a mowing in September. Weeds\r\nare plants out of place, and when these plants are in place they are\r\nnot necessarily weeds, as they have then become serviceable.\r\n\r\nLEGUMES.--In general, legumes are more valuable as cover and green\r\nmanure crops than non-leguminous plants, because as a rule they are\r\nmore rank growers and more deeply rooted, as well as because they add\r\nnitrogen to the soil. But it is rather more difficult to secure a good\r\nstand of most legumes than it is of the crops previously mentioned for\r\nseveral reasons. As a rule the seeds are smaller and a large seed\r\nusually has greater germinating power than a small one. This often\r\nmeans much at the time of the year when the cover crop is sown. Then\r\nlegumes are more difficult to grow, requiring better soil conditions.\r\nStill these should be present in good orchard soils. Drainage must be\r\ngood, the soil must be at least average in fertility and physical\r\ncondition, it must not be sour--hence it is often necessary to use\r\nlime--and soils frequently require inoculation before they will grow\r\nlegumes satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nWhere the clovers grow well they make excellent cover crops as well as\r\ngreen manure crops. The chief difficulty with them is that of\r\nobtaining a good stand in a dry midsummer. The mammoth red and the\r\nmedium red clovers are probably the best of their genus on the heavier\r\nsoils, while crimson clover is best on sandy soils and where it will\r\ngrow, on the lighter gravel loams. The latter is especially well\r\nadapted to building up run down sandy soils. Although it is somewhat\r\neasier to secure a stand of this clover, alsike does not grow rank\r\nenough to make a good cover or green manure crop. Most clovers are\r\ndeep rooted plants and therefore great soil improvers physically as\r\nwell as being great nitrogen gatherers. The amounts of seed required\r\nper acre for the different kinds are about as follows: mammoth fifteen\r\nto twenty pounds; red (medium) twelve to fifteen pounds; crimson\r\ntwelve to fifteen pounds; and alsike ten to twelve pounds.\r\n\r\nWhere it can be readily and successfully grown alfalfa is really a\r\nbetter cover and green manure crop than the clovers. It is deeper\r\nrooted, makes a better top growth, and therefore adds more nitrogen\r\nand more humus to the soil than the clovers. It cannot be recommended\r\nfor common use, however, as it is so difficult to grow except under\r\nfavorable conditions. It requires a more fertile soil than clover, a\r\nsoil with little or no acidity, good drainage, and usually the soil\r\nmust be inoculated. Only where these conditions prevail can alfalfa be\r\ngenerally recommended.\r\n\r\nVetch is an excellent cover and green manure crop, forming a thick,\r\nclose mat of herbage which makes a good cover for the soil. It is very\r\nquick to start growing and a rapid grower in the spring. It also adds\r\nlarger quantities of nitrogen. The hairy or winter vetch lives through\r\nthe hard freezing winters. Summer vetch, although an equally good\r\ngrower, is killed by freezing. One bushel of seed is required per acre\r\nand the seed is expensive, which is the greatest objection to the use\r\nof this excellent crop.\r\n\r\nTwo other less well known and used leguminous crops are well worth\r\ntrial as cover crops--soy beans in the North and cow peas in the\r\nSouth. Both are great nitrogen gatherers and as they are rank and\r\nrapid growers add large quantities of humus to the soil. Under\r\nfavorable conditions they will cover the ground with a perfect mat of\r\nvegetation in a very short time. Being larger seeded, it is\r\nconsiderably easier to obtain a stand on dry soils and in dry seasons\r\nthan it is of the smaller seeded clovers. It is usually best to sow in\r\ndrills the ordinary width, seven inches, apart.\r\n\r\nCow peas are universally used as a cover and green manure crop in the\r\nSouth, but they do not thrive so well in the North. One and one half\r\nto two bushels of seed are required per acre. In the North the earlier\r\nmaturing varieties of soy beans are almost equally good. One to one\r\nand one half bushels of seed are sown per acre.\r\n\r\nLeguminous cover crops are also the best and the cheapest source of\r\nnitrogen for the apple orchard, after they are well established. Their\r\nuse may be overdone, however. Too much nitrogen results in a growth of\r\nwood at the expense of fruit buds. To avoid this it is often advisable\r\nto use non-leguminous and leguminous crops alternately, when the\r\norchard is making a satisfactory growth. Sometimes also these two\r\nkinds of crops, as buckwheat and clover for example, may be combined\r\nwith good results. When this is done one half the usual amount of seed\r\nof each should be used.\r\n\r\nEARLY PLOWING.--Many people make the common mistake of thinking that\r\na green manure crop must be allowed to grow until late in June in\r\norder to secure the maximum amount of growth. There are several\r\nreasons why this is not good practice. In the first place cultivation\r\nis most essential in the early spring as has been pointed out. Then\r\nmoisture is better conserved by plowing under the crop early and a\r\nbetter physical condition of the soil secured. Plowing early in the\r\nspring warms up the soil and sets plants to work more quickly. Lastly,\r\nmaterial rots much more quickly in the early spring when moisture is\r\nmore abundant, which is very important.\r\n\r\nAn apple tree is as much a crop as anything grown on the farm and must\r\nbe so regarded by those who would become successful orchardists. When\r\nit is not properly fed and cared for, good yields of fruit may not\r\njustly be expected. Especially is this true of an orchard which is\r\nbeing intercropped. But because of the fact that an apple tree is not\r\nan annual crop but the product of many years' growth, because its root\r\nsystem is deeper and more widely spread out than those of other crops,\r\nand because the amount of plant food removed in a crop of fruit is\r\ncomparatively small, fertilization is less important than many\r\npersons would have us think. It is a fact that where orchards receive\r\ngood cultivation and a liberal supply of humus commercial fertilizers\r\ngive but medium results.\r\n\r\nELEMENTS OF FERTILITY.--Three elements are necessary for the growth of\r\napple trees, nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash. To these lime may\r\nbe added, although its benefit is indirect rather than direct as a\r\nplant food. How badly any of these elements may be needed depends on\r\nthe soil, its previous treatment, and on the system of management. By\r\nlearning what are the effects of these elements on the tree and fruit\r\nwe may determine under what conditions, if any, their use is\r\nadvisable.\r\n\r\nNitrogen promotes the growth of new wood and leaves, giving the latter\r\na dark green color. In fact the color of the leaves and the amount of\r\nthe wood growth are usually good indicators of the need of nitrogen.\r\nNitrogen in excess develops over vigorous growth and prevents the\r\nmaturity of wood and buds. It always has a tendency to delay the\r\nmaturity of the fruit by keeping it growing late. On many varieties it\r\ntends to produce poorly colored fruits.\r\n\r\nWhen trees are making a normal amount of growth in a year--say a foot\r\nto three feet or more--and when the leaves are of good size and a\r\ndark green in color, there is little need of nitrogen. But when trees\r\nare not growing satisfactorily and the leaves have a sickly yellow\r\ncolor, then the need of nitrogen is evident. On early soils and in\r\nlong growing seasons nitrogen may be more freely and safely used than\r\nunder other conditions.\r\n\r\nThe effect of phosphoric acid and potash on the tree and fruit is much\r\nmore uncertain. They are supposed to influence the quality and the\r\nflavor of the fruit, giving better color and flavor, and this they\r\nundoubtedly do to some extent. Potash probably gives the leaves a\r\ndarker green color. The precise effect of these two elements is at\r\npresent a subject of much discussion, one set of investigators\r\nmaintaining after a long and careful investigation that these effects\r\nare too small to be worth while, and the other claiming that they have\r\na marked effect in the ways above indicated. The only safe guide is\r\nthe actual local result. If the fruit is satisfactory in every way it\r\nwill be of little use to try fertilizers. On the other hand, if it is\r\nnot, then it will pay to experiment with them. The needs of and the\r\nresults on different soils are so variable that it is always wise to\r\nexperiment on a small scale before using fertilizers extensively.\r\n\r\nSTABLE MANURE.--The necessary plant food is best supplied by stable\r\nmanure applied at the rate of ten loads per acre for a light\r\napplication to twenty loads per acre for a heavy application. This\r\namounts to a load for from two to five mature trees. Such an\r\napplication will not only go far toward supplying the necessary\r\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, but especially if coarse will\r\nadd considerable humus and improve the physical condition of the soil.\r\n\r\nExcept on land which washes badly, manure should be applied in the\r\nfall and winter. It should not be piled near the trunk of the tree but\r\nspread uniformly over the entire surface of the ground. It is\r\nparticularly important to spread the manure under and beyond the\r\nfarthest extent of the branches as this is the most important feeding\r\nroot area of the tree.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL FERTILIZERS.--Where manure is not available or where it\r\ncannot be applied in sufficient amounts, commercial fertilizers may be\r\nresorted to, after they have been experimentally tested out.\r\nLeguminous cover crops are the best source of nitrogen, as has been\r\nindicated, but where these do not grow well, or in seasons when they\r\nhave for some reason failed, nitrate of soda or dried blood are good\r\nsubstitutes. From two hundred to three hundred pounds of one or the\r\nother of these may be applied broadcast in the spring soon after\r\ngrowth is well started and all danger of its being checked by frost or\r\ncold weather is past. It is well to apply the nitrate of soda in two\r\napplications a few weeks apart, especially on soils which are leachy\r\nand in wet seasons, as part of the nitrogen may leach away if all is\r\napplied at once. These should be thoroughly worked into the soil with\r\na spring-tooth harrow.\r\n\r\nTo supply the other two elements, from two hundred to four hundred\r\npounds of treated rock phosphate or basic slag for the phosphoric\r\nacid, and the same amount of sulphate of potash for the potash, should\r\nbe applied at any time in the early part of the season, preferably\r\njust before a light rain, and worked into the soil as before.\r\nHome-made wood ashes are a good source of both these elements, and\r\nespecially of the potash. They cannot be purchased economically in any\r\nquantity, but on the general farm there could be no better way to\r\nutilize the wood ashes made around the place than by applying them two\r\nor three bushels to a full grown tree every year or two. Wood ashes\r\nare also a good source of lime, being about one-third calcium oxide.\r\nThus a large amount of available plant food will be supplied to the\r\ntree, and where it is needed should result not only in better wood\r\ngrowth but in the formation of vigorous leaf and fruit buds for the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nLime is not usually considered as a fertilizer except on soils\r\nactually deficient in it. But it will usually be advisable to apply\r\nfrom one thousand five hundred to two thousand pounds of fresh burned\r\nlime or its equivalent, in order to correct any natural soil acidity,\r\nto hasten the decay of organic material, to increase the activity of\r\nthe soil bacteria, and to improve the physical condition of the soil\r\nby floculating the soil particles and helping to break up lumpy soils.\r\nLime also helps to liberate plant food by recombining it with certain\r\nother elements in the soil. All these effects make a more congenial\r\nmedium for the leguminous crops to grow in, and it is frequently\r\nadvisable to use lime for this purpose alone. After this first heavy\r\napplication about 800 pounds of lime should be applied per acre every\r\nfour or five years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINSECTS AND DISEASES AFFECTING THE APPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying among farmers who have grown apples on their\r\nfarms for many years that there are many more pests to fight than\r\nthere used to be. How often we have heard a farmer tell of the perfect\r\napples that grew on a certain tree \"when he was a boy,\" before people\r\nhad generally heard of codling moth, San Jose scale, apple scab, or\r\nother troubles now only too common. \"We never sprayed, but the apples\r\nwere fine,\" he says. Is this the usual glorification of the mythical\r\npast or is it true? In all probability it is a little of both, but it\r\nis undoubtedly true that insects and fungous diseases have increased\r\nrapidly of late years.\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR PEST INCREASE.--When there is an abundance of food and\r\nconditions are otherwise favorable, any animal or plant will thrive\r\nbetter than when the food supply is scarce and conditions unfavorable.\r\nAs long as apple trees were scattered and few in number there was not\r\nthe opportunity for the development of apple pests, but as soon as\r\nthey became numerous the prosperity of bugs and minute plant parasites\r\nwas wonderful to see. Another factor which has been at least partly\r\nresponsible for the great increase in our insect life is that man has\r\nupset nature's balance by destroying so many birds, and, by\r\ninterfering with their natural surroundings, driven them away. Birds\r\nare great destroyers of insects, and their presence in the orchard\r\nshould be encouraged in every possible way. Add to these facts the\r\nmarvelous fecundity of the insect tribe, and the increase is less\r\nremarkable. Loss from these orchard pests has now run up into the\r\nmillions. It has been estimated that the loss in the United States\r\nfrom wormy apples alone is over $11,000,000 annually. Thus has the\r\nnecessity for fighting these enemies of good fruit arisen.\r\n\r\nIn order successfully to combat an insect or a disease it is very\r\nnecessary to have a somewhat detailed knowledge of its life history\r\nand to know its most vulnerable point of attack. It is impossible to\r\nwork most intelligently and effectively without this knowledge, which\r\nshould include the several stages of the insect or disease, the point\r\nof attack, the time of making it, and when and with what it can be\r\nmost easily destroyed. The number of insects and diseases which affect\r\nthe apple is so great that it is simply out of the question to treat\r\nthem all in detail here. We have therefore selected nine insects and\r\nthree diseases as those pests of the apple which are most common and\r\nwhose effects are usually most serious. The essential facts in their\r\nlife histories and their vulnerable points will now be pointed out.\r\nThe method of study may be taken as applicable to any other pests\r\nwhich it may be necessary to combat.\r\n\r\nINSECT PESTS.--Of the many insects which affect either the tree or the\r\nfruit of the apple, the nine selected probably inflict the most damage\r\nand are the most difficult to control of all those in the Northeastern\r\nStates. According to their method of attack all insects may be divided\r\ninto two classes: biting and sucking. Biting insects are those which\r\nactually eat parts of the tree, as the leaves or fruit. These are\r\ncombated by the use of stomach poisons as we shall see in the\r\nfollowing chapter. Sucking insects are those which do not eat the tree\r\nor fruit directly, but by means of a tubelike proboscis suck the\r\njuices or sap from the limbs, leaves or fruit. Of the biting insects\r\nthe five which we shall discuss are: (1) codling moth, (2) apple\r\nmaggot, (3) bud moth, (4) cigar case bearer, (5) curculio. The four\r\nsucking insects discussed are: (6) San Jose scale, (7) oyster shell\r\nscale, (8) blister mite, and (9) aphis or plant louse.\r\n\r\n1. THE CODLING MOTH, the most insidious of all apple pests, is mainly\r\nresponsible for wormy apples. The adult is a night flying moth with a\r\nwing expanse of from one-half to three-quarters of an inch. The moths\r\nappear about the time the apple trees are in bloom. Each female is\r\nsupposed to lay about fifty eggs which are deposited on both the\r\nleaves and fruit, but mostly on the calyx end of the young apples. The\r\neggs hatch in about a week and the young larvae or caterpillars begin\r\nat once to gnaw their way into the core of the fruit. Three-fourths of\r\nthem enter the apple through its blow end.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty to thirty days of eating in the apple, during which time\r\nthey become full grown and about three-quarters of an inch long, they\r\nleave the apple, usually through its side. The full grown caterpillar\r\nnow secretes itself in the crevices in the bark of the tree or in\r\nrubbish beneath the tree and spins a tough but slight silken cocoon in\r\nwhich the pupal period is passed. This lasts about a fortnight, when\r\nthe process is sometimes repeated, so that in the Eastern States there\r\nare often two broods each season.\r\n\r\nThe most vulnerable point in the career of this little animal is when\r\nit is entering the fruit. If a fine poison spray covers the surface of\r\nthe fruit, and especially if it covers the calyx end of the apple\r\ninside and out, when the young larvae begin to eat they will surely be\r\nkilled. It is estimated that birds destroy eighty-five per cent. of\r\nthe cocoons on the bark of trees.\r\n\r\n2. APPLE MAGGOT.--It is fortunate that the apple maggot, often called\r\nthe railroad worm because of its winding tunnels all through the\r\nfruit, is not as serious a pest as the codling moth for it is much\r\nmore difficult to control with a poison. A two-winged fly appears in\r\nearly summer and deposits her eggs in a puncture of the skin of the\r\napple. In a few days the eggs hatch and the maggots begin to burrow\r\nindiscriminately through the fruit. The full grown larvae are a\r\ngreenish white in color and about a quarter of an inch long. From the\r\nfruit this insect goes to the ground where the pupal stage is passed\r\nin the soil. The next summer the fly again emerges and lays its eggs.\r\n\r\nSpraying is not effective against this insect as the poison cannot be\r\nplaced where it will be eaten by the maggots. The best known remedy is\r\nto destroy the fruit which drops to the ground and for this purpose\r\nhogs in the orchard are very effective. The distribution of this\r\ninsect in the orchard is limited and it has shown a marked preference\r\nfor summer and autumn varieties.\r\n\r\n3. THE BUD MOTH closely resembles the codling moth in form and size,\r\nbut differs from it in color and life history. The larvae, after\r\nhibernating through the winter, appear as little brown caterpillars\r\nabout May first or as soon as the buds begin to open, and a week or\r\ntwo later begin their work of destruction. They inflict great damage\r\non the young leaf and fruit buds by feeding on them. When full grown\r\nthe larvae, cinnamon brown in color with a shining black head, are\r\nabout one-half inch long. They then roll themselves up in a tube made\r\nfrom a leaf or parts of leaves securely fastened together with silken\r\nthreads. In this cocoon pupation, which lasts about ten days, takes\r\nplace. Early in June the moths appear. There is but one brood in the\r\nNorth. These insects can be successfully combated with a poison spray\r\napplied early before the buds open.\r\n\r\n4. THE CIGAR CASE BEARER winters in its case attached to a twig. When\r\nthe buds begin to open in the spring it moves to them, carrying its\r\ncase with it, and begins to feed on the young and tender buds. By the\r\ntime the leaves are well open, it has fed a good deal on the tender\r\nbuds and young leaves and is ready to make a new and larger case. This\r\nit does by cutting a leaf to suit and then rolling it up in the form\r\nof a cigar, whence its name. In this case the larvae continue feeding\r\nabout a month, causing much injury to the leaves, although this is not\r\nas serious as the mutilation of the young buds in the spring, before\r\nthe tree is fully leafed out.\r\n\r\nAbout the last of June pupation takes place and in about ten days the\r\nmoth emerges. The eggs are then layed along the midribs of the leaves\r\nand hatch in about fifteen days. The newly hatched larvae become leaf\r\nminers during August, and migrate to the branches again in the fall\r\nwhere they pass the winter. These leaf and bud eating insects can be\r\ndestroyed by applying a poison to the buds before they open and again\r\nlater to the opening leaf and flower buds.\r\n\r\n5. CURCULIO BEETLES pass the winter under leaves and grass. In the\r\nspring they feed on the blossoms and the tender leaves. As soon as the\r\nyoung fruits are formed the female deposits her eggs in a puncture\r\nmade just inside a short, crescent-shaped cut in the little apple. The\r\neggs soon hatch and the young grubs burrow into the fruit to the core\r\nwhere they remain two or three weeks, or until full grown. The larvae\r\nthen bore their way out of the fruit and drop to the soil where they\r\npupate. The earliest of the beetles to emerge again feed on the fruit.\r\nThe principal damage from this pest comes from the feeding of the\r\nbeetles and the work of the larvae, although the latter is not as bad\r\nin the apple as in the stone fruits. A poison on the young foliage as\r\nsoon as the beetles begin to feed is the best method of combating\r\ncurculio. Jarring the tree is not as practicable with the apple as it\r\nis with the plum.\r\n\r\n6. THE SAN JOSE SCALE, one of our worst apple tree pests, is a sucking\r\ninsect extracting the juices of the tree from the trunk, limbs or\r\nbranches, or even from the leaves and fruit when it is very abundant.\r\nAt first the growth is checked only, but as the insects develop their\r\nwork finally results in the death of the part, unless they are\r\ndestroyed. The insect winters in an immature condition on the bark\r\nunder a grayish, circular, somewhat convex scale about the size of a\r\npinhead. The young, of which a great many broods are produced, are\r\nsoft bodied but soon form a scale. In the early spring small\r\ntwo-winged insects issue from these scales.\r\n\r\nAfter mating the males die, but the females continue to grow and in\r\nabout a month begin the production of living young--minute, yellow,\r\noval creatures. These young settle on the bark and push their slender\r\nbeaks into the plant from which they begin to suck out the sap. In\r\nabout twelve days the insects molt and in eight to ten more they\r\nchange to pupae, and in from thirty-three to forty days are themselves\r\nbearing young. A single female may give birth to four hundred young in\r\none season and there are several generations in a season. This great\r\nprolificacy is what makes the scale so serious a pest.\r\n\r\nIn fighting it every scale must be destroyed or thousands more are\r\nsoon born. In order to be able to use a strong enough mixture of lime\r\nand sulphur to destroy them by smothering or choking the spray must be\r\napplied on the dormant wood in the spring or fall or both.\r\nThoroughness is most essential.\r\n\r\n7. THE OYSTER SHELL SCALE, although it is essentially the same in its\r\nhabits and in its methods of sucking the sap from the tree is not as\r\nbad a pest as the San Jose scale because it is less prolific, there\r\nbeing but one brood a year. Still this scale often destroys a branch\r\nand sometimes a whole tree. The \"lice\" winter as eggs under the scale\r\nand hatch in late May or early June. After crawling about the bark for\r\ntwo or three days, the young fix their beaks into it and remain\r\nfastened there for life, sucking out the sap. By the end of the season\r\nthey have matured and secreted a scaly covering under which their eggs\r\nfor the next season's crop winter. A smothering spray like lime and\r\nsulphur applied strong when the trees are dormant will practically\r\ncontrol this scale. But the young may be destroyed in summer by a\r\ncontact spray such as tobacco leaf extract or whale oil soap.\r\n\r\n8. THE LEAF BLISTER MITE is a small, four-legged animal, so small as\r\nhardly to be visible to the naked eye. It passes the winter in the\r\nbud scales and as soon as these begin to open in the spring it passes\r\nto the tender leaves which it punctures, producing light green or\r\nreddish pimples according to the variety of apple. These later develop\r\ninto galls or blisters of a blackish or reddish brown color and\r\nfinally result in the destruction of the leaf. Trees are sometimes\r\npractically defoliated by this pest, and this at a time when a good\r\nfoliage is most needed. Inside of the galls eggs are deposited and\r\nwhen the young hatch they burrow in all directions. In October the\r\nmites abandon the leaves to hibernate in the bud scales again. A\r\nstrong contact spray of lime sulphur when the trees are dormant\r\ndestroys the young mites while they are yet on the bud scales, which\r\nis practically the only time when they are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n9. APHIDES, or plant lice, are of seasonal importance. Although nearly\r\nalways present, it is only occasionally that they become so numerous\r\nas seriously to damage mature apple trees. But they are more often\r\nserious pests on young trees where they should be carefully watched.\r\nTheir presence is determined by the curled and distorted condition of\r\nthe terminal leaves on the under side of which the green or pinkish\r\nlice will be found. Eggs deposited in autumn pass the winter in this\r\ncondition, hatching in the spring about the time of the beginning of\r\nthe growth of vegetation. From these winter eggs females are hatched\r\nwhich bear living young, which may also bear living young and so on\r\nfor several generations until autumn, when eggs are again deposited\r\nfor the winter stage.\r\n\r\nFortunately weather conditions together with parasitic and predaceous\r\ninsects hold them more or less in check. Because of the difficulty of\r\ngetting at the underside of the curled leaves where these lice mostly\r\nwork they are extremely hard to control. Lime and sulphur when the\r\ntrees are dormant destroy as many of the eggs as it comes in contact\r\nwith. A tobacco extract is quite effective as a contact spray in the\r\ngrowing season. The trees must be closely watched and if the lice\r\nappear in any considerable number they must be promptly attended to or\r\nserious damage is likely to result.\r\n\r\nThese are by no means all the insect pests which the fruit grower has\r\nto combat, but they are usually the most important. Canker worm and\r\ntent caterpillars often do great damage in unsprayed orchards, but\r\nthey are easily controlled by an application of a poison as soon as\r\nthey appear. The same is true of other caterpillars and leaf eating\r\nworms. Apple tree borers are frequently serious, especially in young\r\norchards, where the trees should be regularly \"grubbed\" and the borers\r\ndug out or killed with a piece of wire. They may be prevented to some\r\nextent by painting the tree trunks with a heavy lime and sulphur or\r\nsome gas tar preparation.\r\n\r\nDISEASES.--Although not as numerous as insects, the diseases which\r\nattack the apple inflict great damage and are fully as difficult to\r\ncontrol. They are caused by bacteria and by fungi which may be\r\ncompared to weeds growing on or in the tree instead of the soil. If\r\neither of these works within the plant, as is sometimes the case, it\r\nmust be attacked before it enters. It is very necessary to be thorough\r\nin order to control these diseases. Weather conditions influence\r\nnearly all of them materially. Of those which attack the apple tree or\r\nfruit we have selected three as the most serious and the most\r\nnecessary for the grower to combat, namely, (1) apple scab, (2) New\r\nYork apple tree canker, and (3) fire blight. To these should be added\r\nin the South and middle latitudes, sooty blotch and bitter rot.\r\nBaldwin spot is also frequently serious in some seasons and\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\n(1) THE APPLE SCAB, commonly known among growers as \"the fungus,\" is\r\nthe most important of our common apple diseases and is most evident on\r\nthe fruit, although it attacks the leaves as well. In some seasons the\r\nfruit is made almost unsalable. This disease lives through the winter\r\non old leaves. In the spring about blossoming time the spores are\r\nscattered by the wind and other agencies, and reaching the tender\r\nshoots germinate and enter the tissues of the plant. Their development\r\nis greatly dependent on the weather. In a season in which there is\r\nlittle fog or continued damp or humid weather, they may not develop at\r\nall, but where these conditions are present they frequently become\r\nvery virulent.\r\n\r\nSpraying will be governed by the weather conditions, but the mixture\r\nmust be applied very promptly as soon as it is evident that it is\r\nlikely to be necessary and must cover every part of the tree to be\r\neffective. The object is to prevent the spores from germinating, the\r\nspray being entirely a preventive and in no sense a cure. The disease\r\nmost frequently first manifests itself on the tender new growth and on\r\nthe blossoms. Two mixtures have been found to control it, namely,\r\nBordeaux and a weak solution of lime and sulphur. One or other of\r\nthese should be applied just before the blossoms open, just before\r\nthey fall, and when necessary two and nine weeks later.\r\n\r\n(2) NEW YORK APPLE TREE CANKER is usually found mainly on the trunks\r\nof old trees, but it also affects the smaller branches. Practically\r\nevery old or uncared for orchard has more or less of this canker, and\r\nwhere it is not checked it eventually destroys the tree. This fungus\r\nis the cause of most of the dead wood found in old orchards. The\r\nsurface of the canker is black and rough and covered with minute black\r\npimples. It lives over winter and spreads from one branch or tree to\r\nanother. As it most frequently enters a branch through wounds made in\r\npruning, these should be promptly painted over with a heavy lead and\r\noil paint. All diseased parts should be cut out and removed as soon as\r\nobserved. The value of spraying for this disease is not definitely\r\nknown, but it is seldom very troublesome in well sprayed and well\r\ncared for orchards.\r\n\r\n(3) BLIGHT appears on apple trees in three forms, as blossom blight,\r\nas twig blight, and as blight cankers. It is a bacterial disease\r\nwhich is distributed by flies, bees, birds, etc., and cannot be\r\ncontrolled by spraying. The bacteria are carried over the winter in\r\ncankers on the main limbs and bodies of the trees, oozing out in a\r\nsticky mass in the spring. These cankers should be cut out with a\r\nsharp knife cutting well into the healthy bark and then washing the\r\nwound with corrosive sublimate, one part to one thousand of water.\r\nCutting out and destroying are also the chief remedies to be used when\r\nthe blight appears in the twigs and blossoms. It is not usually as\r\nserious on apples as on pears. Some varieties, like Alexander, are\r\nmore subject to it than others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF SPRAYING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spraying of fruit trees in the United States is of comparatively\r\nrecent origin, having been a general commercial practice for less than\r\ntwo decades. It involves the principle of applying with force and in\r\nthe form of a fine rain or mist, water in which a poison or a\r\nsubstance which kills by contact is suspended. The first application\r\nof the principle was against chewing insects with hellebore. Pure\r\narsenic was early used and soon led to the use of other arsenicals.\r\n\r\nOur greatest fungicide, Bordeaux mixture, was discovered by accident\r\nin 1882 when it was found to control mildew in France. Up until about\r\nfive years ago Bordeaux mixture as the fungicide and paris green as\r\nthe poison were almost universally used. Within the last few years,\r\nhowever, there have been developed two substitutes which, although\r\nknown and used to some extent for twenty years, have only recently\r\ncome into such general use as practically to replace the old sprays.\r\nThese are lime and sulphur as the fungicide and partial insecticide\r\nand arsenate of lead as a partial insecticide.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for and the advisability of spraying have already been\r\npointed out. There is an increasing demand for fine fruit the\r\nsupplying of which is possible only with thorough spraying. In the\r\nhumid East especially the competition of more progressive sections in\r\nthe West is demanding more and better spraying. There is no cure-all\r\nin this process. It does not make a tree more fruitful except as it\r\nimproves its general health, but it does bring a larger percentage of\r\nthe fruit to perfection. Certain knowledge is fundamental; the grower\r\nmust know what he is spraying for, when and with what to combat it and\r\nhow to accomplish the desired result most effectively.\r\n\r\nSpraying is an insurance against anticipated troubles with the fruit,\r\nand the best and most successful growers are those most completely\r\ninsured. It has many general advantages also. It stimulates the grower\r\nto a greater interest in his business because of the extra knowledge\r\nand skill required. It compels thoroughness. It necessitates spending\r\nmoney, therefore a return is looked for. To be sure, it is only one\r\nof the operations necessary to success, but it enables us to grow a\r\nquality of fruit which we could not obtain without it.\r\n\r\nSPRAY MATERIALS are conveniently divided into two classes,\r\ninsecticides and fungicides. An insecticide is a poison by which the\r\ninsect is killed either directly by eating it, or indirectly by the\r\ncaustic, smothering, or stifling effects resulting from closing its\r\nbreathing pores. Direct poisons are used for insects which eat some\r\npart of the tree or fruit and are called stomach poisons. Sprays which\r\nkill indirectly are used for insects which suck the sap or juice from\r\nthe tree or fruit and are called contact sprays. Arsenical compounds\r\nhave supplanted practically all other substances used to combat\r\nexternal biting insects. Two stomach poisons are commonly used,\r\nnamely, arsenate of lead and paris green, but the former is rapidly\r\nreplacing the latter.\r\n\r\nARSENATE OF LEAD is prepared by mixing three parts of crystallized\r\narsenate of soda with seven parts of crystallized white sugar\r\n(acetate) of lead in water, but it will not as a rule pay the grower\r\nto mix his own material, as arsenate of lead can be purchased in\r\nconvenient commercial form at a reasonable price. The preparation on\r\nthe market is a finely pulverized precipitate in two forms, one a\r\npowder and the other a paste. These are probably about equally good\r\nand are readily kept suspended in water. Less free arsenic is\r\ncontained in this form than in any other compound of arsenic, making\r\nit safer to use, especially in heavy applications. Arsenate of lead\r\nmay be used without danger of burning the foliage as strong as five or\r\nsix pounds to fifty gallons of water, but three pounds is the usual\r\nand a sufficient amount for the control of any apple insect for which\r\nit is efficacious.\r\n\r\nPARIS GREEN is being rapidly displaced by arsenate of lead for several\r\nreasons. It is a compound of white arsenic, copper oxide, and acetic\r\nacid. The commercial form is a crystal which in suspension settles\r\nrapidly, a serious fault. It is more soluble than arsenate of lead and\r\nhence there is greater danger of burning the foliage with it.\r\nMoreover, it costs from twenty to twenty-five cents a pound, and the\r\narsenate of lead can be purchased for from eight to ten cents a pound.\r\n\r\nThe amount which it is safe to use in fifty gallons of water is from\r\none-half to three-quarters of a pound. When paris green is used alone\r\nas a poison lime should be added. Both these arsenicals should be\r\nthoroughly wet up by stirring in a smaller receptacle before they are\r\nput into the spray tank, in order to get them in as complete\r\nsuspension as possible. They may be used in the same mixture with\r\nBordeaux or lime sulphur.\r\n\r\nCONTACT SPRAYS.--Four compounds are used as contact sprays in\r\ncombating sucking insects, namely, lime sulphur, soaps such as whale\r\noil soap, kerosene emulsion, and tobacco extract. Of these lime\r\nsulphur is the most used and for winter spraying is probably the best.\r\nThis preparation is made by boiling together for one hour or until\r\nthey unite, twenty pounds of quick lime, fifteen pounds of flower of\r\nsulphur, and fifty gallons of water. Although the home made mixture is\r\nmuch cheaper than the commercial form which may be purchased on the\r\nmarket, many people prefer the latter because of the inconvenience and\r\ntrouble of preparing the mixture, although there is nothing difficult\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nThis contact spray is used chiefly for the San Jose scale and the\r\nblister mite, and in order to control these must be applied strong on\r\nthe dormant wood. The strength necessary will vary from one part of\r\nthe mixture above mentioned or of the commercial preparation, to from\r\nseven to ten parts of water, according to the density test of the\r\nmaterial, which should be around twenty-eight per cent. Beaume (a\r\nscale for measuring the density of a liquid) for home made, and\r\nthirty-two per cent. for the commercial mixture.\r\n\r\nAny good soap is effective in destroying soft bodied insects such as\r\nplant lice. The fish oil soaps, although variable in composition, are\r\noften valuable, especially the one known in the trade as whale oil\r\nsoap. This soap dissolved in water by boiling at the rate of two\r\npounds of soap to one gallon of water, makes a good winter spray for\r\nscale but should be applied before it gets cold as it is then apt to\r\nbecome gelatinous. For a summer contact spray against lice, one pound\r\nof soap to seven gallons of water is strong enough to be effective. It\r\nis objectionable because of its odor and because it is disagreeable to\r\nmake and handle. Lime sulphur is to be preferred as a winter spray,\r\nbut the soap spray is often necessary and valuable for summer sucking\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nKerosene emulsion was formerly more commonly used than now against the\r\nscale and plant lice. It is a mixture of one-half pound of soap and\r\ntwo gallons of kerosene in one gallon of water--preferably in hot\r\nwater. For dormant trees one gallon of this mixture should be diluted\r\nwith six gallons of water. While this spray is effective it is no more\r\nso than lime-sulphur and is quite difficult and disagreeable to\r\nhandle. As a summer spray, however, it is often necessary. Several\r\npreparations of petroleum known as the miscible oils are sometimes\r\nused. Their use is the same as that of lime-sulphur and they are not\r\nas good.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years a tobacco concoction known as black leaf\r\ntobacco extract (nicotine sulphate) has come into quite common use. It\r\ncan be purchased commercially under various brand names, and should be\r\ndiluted according to its strength, but usually about one part to fifty\r\nof water. It may be made by boiling one pound of good tobacco stems in\r\ntwo gallons of water for one-half-hour. Objections to it are that it\r\nevaporates very quickly, although it is supposed to be non-volatile,\r\nand that it is expensive, but it is very convenient to use, can be\r\nreadily mixed with other summer sprays, and is very effective against\r\nplant lice and mites.\r\n\r\nBORDEAUX MIXTURE. Fungicides are mixtures of chemical compounds made\r\nup for the purpose of controlling plant diseases caused by a class of\r\nplant weeds known as fungi. There are three commonly well known and\r\nused fungicides, Bordeaux mixture, commercial lime sulphur, and the\r\nself-boiled lime-sulphur. The Bordeaux mixture is the best all-around\r\nfungicide known. It is a mixture of three pounds of copper sulphate\r\n(blue vitriol or bluestone) with three or more pounds of fresh burned\r\nstone lime in fifty gallons of water. The two compounds should be put\r\ntogether as fruit growers say \"with water between,\" that is each\r\nshould be diluted with the water separately before the two are mixed.\r\n\r\nThe best plan is to have stock mixtures of each in barrels, fifty\r\ngallon cider or vinegar barrels making good receptacles for the\r\npurpose. Place the bluestone in an old fertilizer or meal sack and\r\nsuspend it about midway in the barrel of water. In a few hours it will\r\nall be dissolved and will remain in suspension for some length of time\r\nvery well. If say fifty pounds of the copper sulphate are dissolved in\r\nfifty gallons of water, each gallon of water will contain one pound of\r\nthe bluestone, which makes a very convenient way to measure it. So\r\nalso fifty pounds of fresh burned stone lime should be placed in a\r\nbarrel--in this case in the bottom of the barrel rather than in a\r\nsack--just covered with water and allowed to slake, more water being\r\nadded as required up to fifty gallons. If too much water is added to\r\nthe lime at the first it will be \"drowned\" and its slaking checked.\r\nThese two stock mixtures, each gallon containing one pound of the\r\ncopper sulphate or one pound of the lime, are then mixed together.\r\n\r\nIt is well to fill the tank about half full of water, then put in the\r\nrequired amount of the copper sulphate, and after stirring well add\r\nthe lime milk. It is a good plan to add an excess of lime as it\r\nminimizes the danger of burning and aids the mixture in sticking to\r\nthe leaves well. If one is sure that he has at least as much lime, or\r\nan excess of lime, it will not be necessary to test the mixture, but\r\nif he is not, a simple test may be made with ferro-cyanide of\r\npotassium, obtained at a drug store. A few drops of this mixture will\r\ndisappear if the lime is equal or in excess of the copper sulphate,\r\nthat is, it will be neutralized, but if it is not, they will remain a\r\nbright purplish red. Bordeaux mixture is used in strengths varying\r\nfrom three to five pounds each of bluestone and lime in fifty gallons\r\nof water, but the former is usually sufficient.\r\n\r\nLIME-SULPHUR.--The more important fungicides, the commercial lime\r\nsulphur and the self-boiled lime-sulphur, are practically superseding\r\nBordeaux as a fungicide, not because they are necessarily better, but\r\nbecause there is frequently much burning of the foliage and russeting\r\nof the fruit from the use of the Bordeaux. This is unfortunate as the\r\nlatter is a rather more effective fungicide as well as more convenient\r\nand pleasant to use. The self-boiled lime sulphur is a combination of\r\nlime and sulphur which is boiled by the heat of the slaking lime\r\nalone, and makes a pretty good substitute for the Bordeaux when it\r\ninjures foliage or fruit. This preparation of lime and sulphur differs\r\nfrom the commercial form used as a winter wash in that it is wholly a\r\nmechanical mixture and not partly chemical like the latter. It may\r\ntherefore be used on the foliage in summer at a greater strength,\r\nthere being only a very small percentage of sulphur in solution when\r\nthe mixture is properly made.\r\n\r\nEqual amounts of lime and sulphur are used, these being from eight to\r\nten pounds each to fifty gallons of water. The mixture is best\r\nprepared in larger quantities so as to get heat enough from the\r\nslaking lime to produce a violent boiling for a few minutes. First,\r\nplace say forty pounds of lime in a barrel and pour on just water\r\nenough to start it slaking nicely--about a gallon to each three or\r\nfour pounds of lime is usually sufficient. Then add the sulphur and\r\nenough more water to slake the paste, keeping it well stirred\r\nmeanwhile. The violent boiling of the lime in slaking will cook the\r\nmixture in from five to fifteen minutes, depending on the quality of\r\nthe lime and how fast it is slaked. Just as soon as the violent\r\nboiling is over add enough cold water to stop all action. If this is\r\nnot done, some sulphur will unite with the lime and burning may be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThis self-boiled mixture is entirely harmless to apple foliage and\r\neven appears to have a stimulating effect upon it. Against the apple\r\nscab, however, it is not as effective as the boiled wash, or the\r\ncommercial preparations. For this disease a strength of from one to\r\nthirty to one to forty (that is about one and one-half gallons of the\r\nprepared mixture testing 31 to 33 Beaume to fifty gallons of water) of\r\nthe commercial lime-sulphur is most effective.\r\n\r\nSPRAY PUMPS.--The application of the foregoing spray mixtures is fully\r\nas important as the sprays themselves, for on the right application at\r\nthe right time depends the efficacy of the spray. For this purpose a\r\nconsiderable amount of special machinery has been devised. Lack of\r\nspace prevents us from going into much detail on this question, so we\r\nmust be content with merely outlining the different types of machines\r\nand mentioning their accessories. Sprays are forced through single,\r\ndouble or triple acting pumps, either by hand or power. The three\r\ntypes of power available are traction, compressed air, and gasoline,\r\nthe last being the most used. Steam power is practically obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe knapsack is the simplest type of hand pump, but it is of no\r\npractical use in the mature apple orchard. For small orchards and\r\nsmall trees several types of hand pumps are quite effective. The lever\r\ntype of pump, where the handle is pushed from and pulled toward the\r\noperator, probably gives the most power with the least tiring effect,\r\nbecause it enables one to use the weight of the body to some extent.\r\nIt is best not to have the pump attached to the spray barrel or tank,\r\nbut set on a movable base of its own, as then it can be used for any\r\none of a number of barrels. Such an outfit may be obtained for from\r\ntwenty-five to forty dollars.\r\n\r\nIt is well to buy a standard make of pump, preferably from a nearby\r\ndealer, so that repairs may be readily secured. For all orchards up to\r\nthree or four acres in size, and for larger orchards where the trees\r\nare not over twelve or fifteen feet in height, this kind of spray rig\r\nis the most practicable and advisable, when the expense is taken into\r\nconsideration. This applies especially to the general farm.\r\n\r\nThe power of a traction sprayer is developed from the wheels. There is\r\nmuch discussion as to whether sufficient power to throw an effective\r\nspray can be supplied by this method. By accumulating considerable\r\npressure by extra driving at the ends of the rows and then skipping\r\nevery other tree in order to keep up the pressure, going over the rows\r\ntwice, a very satisfactory pressure can be obtained for trees which\r\nare not too large. The argument for this type of machine, and it is\r\nespecially applicable on the general farm, is that it can be used for\r\nother spraying on the farm as well as for the apple orchard,\r\nespecially for potatoes and small fruits. It is a comparatively cheap\r\ntype of power, particularly when it can be used for several purposes.\r\n\r\nThe compressed air gas sprayer comes next in point of simplicity and\r\ncost for a power sprayer. Its most economic use is found where\r\norcharding is carried on extensively enough to pay to compress the air\r\nor gas right in the orchard. This is of course impracticable on the\r\ngeneral farm. Therefore the air or gas must be purchased and shipped\r\nto the farm in steel tubes. This often causes delay at critical times\r\nand is rather expensive. Moreover, the gas is open to the objection of\r\ninterfering with the lime-sulphur compound by precipitating some of\r\nthe sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe gasoline engine is the most useful and popular type of power for\r\nthe orchard sprayer, as well as for general use on the farm. Many\r\nmakes are now so perfected that they give little or no trouble. One\r\nand a half or two horsepower are fully sufficient for spraying, but\r\nmost farmers prefer from three to five horsepower in order to be able\r\nto use the engine more for other purposes. The latter power is open to\r\nobjection for spraying purposes on account of its weight, as\r\nespecially in early spring it is very difficult to haul so heavy a rig\r\nover the soft ground. Such an outfit is also rather expensive.\r\nStandard makes of gasoline engines of sufficient power for spraying\r\ncost from $75.00 to $150.00 according to horsepower and efficiency.\r\nFor very large trees, for mature orchards, and for all orchards larger\r\nthan four or five acres, the gasoline engine is the best source of\r\npower for spraying, particularly where it can be used for other\r\npurposes on the farm.\r\n\r\nA double acting or two cylinder pump is most desirable. If there is\r\nplenty of power a triplex or three cylinder pump is still better. The\r\nrequirements of a good pump are: sufficient power for the work desired\r\nof it; strong but not too heavy; fewest possible number of parts\r\nconsistent with efficiency; brass parts and valves; and a good sized\r\nair chamber. A number of standard makes of pumps answer these\r\nconditions very well. Pumps should always be washed out with clean\r\nwater when the operator is through with them and the metal parts\r\ncoated with vaseline. Never leave water in a pump chamber or in the\r\nengine jacket in cold weather.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary hand pump and barrel give satisfactory use when placed on\r\na wagon, unless the trees are very high. But for large orchards, high\r\ntrees, and where larger tanks and power pumps are used it is\r\ndesirable to have a special truck for the outfit. The front wheel\r\nshould be made low so as to turn under the tank to enable the driver\r\nto make short turns around the trees. A tower is desirable where high\r\nold trees are to be sprayed. This should be substantial but as small\r\nas is consistent with the purpose so as not to catch on the limbs and\r\nmake it difficult to get close up around the trees. The height of the\r\nplatform must be regulated by the need and by the roughness of the\r\nground. On steep side hills the wagon body on which the tank rests\r\nshould be underslung.\r\n\r\nIn order to get as near to the work as possible get a long hose--from\r\ntwenty to thirty feet according to circumstances. The best quality,\r\nthree to five ply, is none too good. Hose should be three-eighths to\r\none-half inch in diameter, one inch being too heavy. Extension rods\r\nare a practical necessity. They should be ten to twelve feet long and\r\nmade of bamboo lined with brass, that is, as light as possible.\r\nNozzles are very important in thorough and effective spraying. There\r\nis no best nozzle, nor one with which all the work can be done.\r\n\r\nSeveral things should be considered in selecting a nozzle. First of\r\nall, it must be of convenient form so as not to catch in trees and so\r\nconstructed that it will not clog easily. Second, for apple trees it\r\nshould have good capacity and deliver as spreading a spray as\r\npossible. Third, the nature of the spray is very important.\r\nInsecticides should usually be applied with force in a comparatively\r\ncoarse driving spray, but fungicides should be applied in a fine mist\r\nor fog so that they will settle on every part of the tree. Therein\r\nlies the difficulty of applying insecticides and fungicides together.\r\n\r\nTIME OF SPRAYING.--Fortunately it is not necessary to make a separate\r\napplication for each insect and disease, but they may be treated\r\ntogether to some extent. In most cases expediency demands that the\r\narsenicals be used with the fungicides. Many growers are finding the\r\nmost satisfactory results, however, from applying the arsenical spray\r\nseparately, just after the blossoms fall, because of the physical\r\nimpossibility of properly applying the two sprays--the driving and the\r\nmist spray--together. For most practical purposes on the general farm,\r\nthree sprayings are necessary in order to secure clean fruit and four,\r\nsometimes five, are often advisable. These may be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. With lime-sulphur, winter strength, on the dormant wood in\r\n    early spring.\r\n\r\n    2. With lime-sulphur and arsenate of lead just before the\r\n    blossoms open (may sometimes be omitted).\r\n\r\n    3. With the same (or Bordeaux for scab) just after the blossoms\r\n    fall.\r\n\r\n    4. With the same two or three weeks later.\r\n\r\n    5. With arsenate of lead eight or nine weeks later (may\r\n    sometimes be omitted).\r\n\r\n      (In the south and middle latitudes where bitter rot and apple\r\n      blotch occur two other sprayings may be necessary.)\r\n\r\n    6. With Bordeaux about eight or ten weeks after the blossoms fall.\r\n\r\n    7. Again with the same about two weeks later.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Calendar for Spraying Apples\r\n\r\n--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+---------+----------\r\nINSECTS | Nature | Before | Before | After  | In 2  |  In 8   | Materials\r\n        | of     | Leaf   | Flower | Petals | to 3  |  to 9   | to\r\n        | Injury | Buds   | Buds   | Fall   | Weeks |  Weeks  | Use\r\n        |        | Open   | Open   |        |       |         |\r\n--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------+---------+----------\r\nCodling | Eating |        |        |    x   |    x  |    x    | Lead\r\nMoth    | Worm   |        |        |        |       |         | Arsenate\r\n        |        |        |        |        |       |         | or\r\n        |        |        |        |        |       |         | Par.

By \"green\" we mean not fully ripe, not ripe\r\nenough to eat out of hand. This is necessary for all fruit which is to\r\nbe shipped any considerable distance or which is to be stored. Used in\r\nthis sense green has no reference to color, but as a matter of fact,\r\nmuch of our fruit is picked too green, before it has even reached its\r\nfull size and is well colored. There is no exact time at which apples\r\nmust be picked, but this depends on many factors such as the variety,\r\nthe distance to be shipped, the soil, the climate, and various other\r\nconditions, to say nothing of seasonal differences.\r\n\r\nThe time at which any variety should be picked in a particular section\r\nwill be learned by experience. In general, apples should be left on\r\nthe tree as long as possible in order to get the best size and color.\r\nWhen the apples begin to drop badly it is a pretty sure indication\r\nthat it is time to pick. If the fruit is to be sold in the local\r\nmarket or for immediate consumption, it may be allowed to get riper\r\nthan would otherwise be the case. With most varieties one picking is\r\nsufficient, but in the case of varieties like the Wealthy which does\r\nnot ripen uniformly, or like the Twenty Ounce, which does not always\r\ncolor evenly, two or three pickings should be made. Two or three\r\npickings are practically always necessary where fancy fruit is\r\ndesired, in order to get the ideal size, color, and uniformity.\r\n\r\nLADDERS.--There are two general types of picking ladders, the rung and\r\nthe step ladders. For large trees the rung ladders are the best. They\r\nmay be obtained in lengths to suit the height of the tree. Lengths of\r\nmore than twenty-two or twenty-four feet become too heavy and clumsy\r\nto handle, even when made of pine, which is the best material as it is\r\nlight and strong for its weight. In very old, high trees extension\r\nrung ladders are sometimes used. They are also useful for interior\r\nwork but are heavy to handle. Rung ladders cost from ten to twenty\r\ncents a running foot. Step ladders are useful only on young and small\r\ntrees. The two styles, the three (Japanese) and four legged, are both\r\nquite satisfactory where one can reach the fruit from them.\r\n\r\nReceptacles for picking usually hold about half a bushel. Both baskets\r\nand bags are used, some preferring one and some the other, and a\r\nchoice between them is merely a matter of personal preference. There\r\nis a little less liability of bruising the apples in bags than in\r\nbaskets, but the latter are more convenient in some ways. Fruit should\r\nnever be thrown or dropped into a basket but always handled carefully.\r\nSome varieties, as McIntosh, show almost every finger mark and\r\nliterally require handling with gloves.\r\n\r\nHANDLING.--The old custom of picking and laying on the ground in the\r\norchard is a poor one and should not be followed, as it causes\r\nunnecessary handling and bruising. Moreover, fruit should be packed\r\nand hauled to storage as soon after picking as possible. Picking and\r\nplacing directly on the packing table from which the apples are\r\nimmediately packed is the best plan where it is practicable, but as\r\nthe weather at picking time in the Eastern States is frequently quite\r\nuncertain, it is not always possible to follow this plan as closely as\r\ncan be done in the West, where dry air and sunshine prevail. Still,\r\nwherever there is a considerable quantity of fruit and several\r\npickers, the plan of packing directly from the table is best. Many\r\ngrowers pick in boxes and barrels and haul the apples to a packing\r\nshed to be packed later. Convenience and expediency must govern the\r\ngeneral farmer who is not always at liberty to choose the best plan,\r\noften having to do as he can.\r\n\r\nPACKING TABLES enable the grower to pack his fruit better because he\r\ncan see better what he is doing, and to handle the fruit more cheaply\r\nand quickly and with less injury. They should be portable so that they\r\ncan be moved about the orchard. A convenient type has one end mounted\r\non wheels so that it can be pushed from one place to another. The top\r\nof the table should be made of two strong layers of canvas, one tacked\r\nfirmly to the framework of the table with about three or four inches\r\nof dip and the other laid loosely over it. This plan provides a soft\r\nresting place for the fruit and the table can be easily cleaned off by\r\nsimply throwing back the upper layer of canvas.\r\n\r\nThree feet six inches is about the right width for the table, and the\r\nsame sloping to three feet four inches at one end, is the correct\r\nheight from the ground. Most packers like to have this gradual slope\r\nto one end so that the apples will naturally feed toward that end. The\r\nlength may be anything up to eight or ten feet, beyond which the table\r\nbecomes heavy and unmanageable.\r\n\r\nBARRELS.--The standard apple barrel adopted by the National Apple\r\nShippers' Association and made law in New York State has a length of\r\nstave of twenty-eight and one-half inches and a diameter of head of\r\nseventeen and one-eighth inches. The outside circumference of the\r\nbilge is sixty-four inches and the distance between the heads is\r\ntwenty-six inches. It contains one hundred quarts dry measure. The\r\nstaves are mostly made of elm, pine, and red gum, and the heads\r\nprincipally of pine with some beech and maple. In most apple growing\r\nsections barrels are made in regular cooper shops where their\r\nmanufacture is a business by itself. Only the largest growers set up\r\ntheir own barrels. Practically all barrels are purchased \"knocked\r\ndown\" and it costs from four to six cents each to set them up. Barrels\r\ncan ordinarily be purchased for about thirty-five cents each, but the\r\ncost varies somewhat with the season and the region.\r\n\r\nApple packages should always present a neat, clean, and attractive\r\nappearance. Never use flour barrels, soiled or ununiform barrels of\r\nany kind. If a head cushion is used a good deal of waste from the\r\ncrushing and bruising of the fruit will be saved. A head lining of\r\nplain or fringed paper also adds much to the attractiveness of the\r\npackage. The wrapping of apples for barrel packing is hardly\r\nadvisable. The fruit is pressed into the barrel tightly with one of\r\ntwo types of presses, both of which are good.\r\n\r\nThe lever press is more responsive and the pressure is more easily\r\nchanged, but it is harder to operate. The screw press distributes the\r\npressure more evenly with less injury to the fruit and is more\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nThe steps in properly packing a barrel of apples are: First, see that\r\nthe middle and closed end hoops are tight, if necessary, nailing them\r\nand clinching the nails; second, mark the head plainly with the grade\r\nand variety and the name of the packer or owner; then place the barrel\r\non a solid floor or plank and lay in the facing papers (the face end\r\nbeing packed first); select the \"facers,\" which should be the best\r\nrepresentatives of the grade being packed, and _no others_, and place\r\nthem in two courses in regular order stems down; with a drop handle\r\nbasket fill the barrel, using care not to bruise the fruit, and\r\njarring the barrel back and forth on the plank as each basket is put\r\ninto it in order to settle the fruit firmly in place; lastly, arrange\r\na layer of apples stems up and apply the press, using a hatchet to get\r\nthe head in place and to drive on and tighten the hoops.\r\n\r\nTHE BOX PACKAGE is rapidly growing in favor, especially as a carrier\r\nof fancy fruit. There is no standard box the size of which is fixed by\r\nlaw unless it be a box labeled a bushel. But two sizes of boxes are in\r\ncommon use, both probably being necessary on account of the variation\r\nin the size of different varieties. The \"Standard\" box is 101/2 by 111/2\r\nby 18 inches inside measurement and contains 2,173.5 cubic inches (the\r\nlawful stricken bushel is 2,150.4 cubic inches). The \"Special\" box is\r\n10 by 11 by 20 inches inside measurement and contains 2,200 cubic\r\ninches. The bulge when properly made will add about 150 cubic inches\r\nmore, making the two boxes hold 2,323.5 cubic inches and 2,350 cubic\r\ninches respectively.\r\n\r\nSpruce is the most reliable and in general the best material. Fir is\r\nsometimes used, but is likely to split. Pine is good if strong enough.\r\nThe ends should be of three-quarter-inch material; the sides of\r\nthree-eighth-inch, and the tops and bottoms--two pieces each--of\r\none-quarter-inch material. There should also be two cleats each for\r\ntop and bottom. The sides of the box should be nailed with four,\r\npreferably five-penny cement-coated nails, at each end. The cleats\r\nshould be put neatly on each end and four nails put into them, going\r\nthrough into the top and bottom. Boxes commonly come \"knocked down\" or\r\nin the flat and are usually put together by the grower. They cost from\r\nten to thirteen cents each in the flat.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of packs, depending on the size of the apples\r\nand the choice of the grower. The diagonal pack with each apple\r\nresting over the spaces between others is preferable, but on account\r\nof the size of the apples one is often forced to use the straight pack\r\nwith the apples in regular right angle rows for some sizes. The offset\r\npack, first three (or four) on one side and then on the other, is\r\nvery much like the diagonal, but not much used on account of its\r\naccommodating too few apples in a box. The following table gives the\r\npacks, number of rows, number of apples in the row, box to use, and\r\nnumber of apples used to the box, as used at Hood River, Oregon:\r\n\r\n                                        No.\r\n  Size expressed                       apples      No.\r\n  in No. apples                         in      layers in   Box\r\n  per box          Tier       Pack      row       depth     used\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     45            3       3 St.        5-5         3       Standard\r\n     54            3       3 St.        6-6         3       Special\r\n     63            3       3 St.        7-7         3       Special\r\n     64            31/2      2-2 Diag.    4-4         4       Standard\r\n     72            31/2      2-2 Diag.    4-5         4       Standard\r\n     80            31/2      2-2 Diag.    5-5         4       Standard\r\n     88            31/2      2-2 Diag.    5-6         4       Standard\r\n     96            31/2      2-2 Diag.    6-6         4       Special\r\n     104           31/2      2-2 Diag.    6-7         4       Special\r\n     112           31/2      2-2 Diag.    7-7         4       Special\r\n     120           31/2      2-2 Diag.    7-8         4       Special\r\n     128           4       4 St.        8-8         4       Special\r\n     144           4       4 St.        9-9         4       Special\r\n     150           41/2      3-2 Diag.    6-6         5       Standard\r\n     163           41/2      3-2 Diag.    6-7         5       Standard\r\n     175           41/2      3-2 Diag.    7-7         5       Standard\r\n     185           41/4      3-2 Diag.    7-8         5       Special\r\n     200           41/2      3-2 Diag.    8-8         5       Special\r\n\r\nIt is good practice to wrap apples packed in boxes. For this purpose a\r\nheavy-weight tissue paper in two sizes, 8 by 10 and 10 by 10,\r\naccording to the size of the apple, is used. A lining paper 18 by 24\r\nin size and \"white news\" in grade is first placed in the box. Between\r\nthe layers of apples a colored \"tagboard\" paper, size 171/4 by 11 or 20\r\nby 93/4, according to the box used, is laid so as to make the layers\r\ncome out right at the top. In packing the box is inclined toward the\r\npacker for convenience in placing the fruit. After laying in the\r\nlining paper each apple is wrapped and put in place. As an aid to\r\npicking up the thin wrapping paper a rubber \"finger\" is used on the\r\nforefinger. When the box is packed the layers should stand a quarter\r\nto a half inch higher in the middle than at the ends, in order to give\r\na bulge or spring to the top and bottom which holds the fruit firmly\r\nin place without bruising.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion as to whether the box or the barrel is\r\nthe better package for apples. This is needless, for as a matter of\r\nfact each is best for its own particular purpose. The barrel is best\r\nadapted as a package for large commercial quantities of fruit and\r\nwhere labor could not be had to pack apples in boxes even if the trade\r\nwanted them. The barrel permits the packing of a greater variety in\r\nsize and shape than does the box, and these can be more easily and\r\ncheaply handled in packing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the box is the ideal package for small amounts of\r\nfancy fruit, to be used for a family-or fruit-stand trade. It presents\r\na neater and more fancy appearance and is a more convenient package to\r\nhandle, as well as one which is more open to inspection. It already\r\nhas a better reputation as a quality container than the barrel. As a\r\nfancy package for a limited private trade from the small general farm\r\norchard with high-class varieties like the Northern Spy, McIntosh, and\r\nothers there is no comparison of the box with the barrel.\r\n\r\nSTORAGE.--Car refrigeration and cold storage of fruit are\r\ncomparatively modern developments. Few persons who have not been\r\naffected directly realize what a tremendous influence they have had\r\nupon the fruit, and particularly the apple industry. Apples could not\r\nbe shipped any very great distance. Crops had to be marketed\r\nimmediately and when they were large the markets were soon glutted and\r\nthe fruit became almost valueless. The first hot spell would\r\ndemoralize the trade altogether. Then later in the season the supply\r\nwould become exhausted and famine would ensue where but a few weeks\r\nbefore there had been a feast. Under such conditions it is not\r\nsurprising that the apple industry did not develop very rapidly and\r\nthat apple growing was mostly confined to areas near the larger\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the refrigerator car extended fruit-growing over a much\r\nwider area. Refrigeration on shipboard opened up and enlarged the\r\nexport trade. Cold storage warehouses lengthened the season by holding\r\nover the surplus of fruit, thus relieving fall gluts in the market and\r\nproviding a winter supply of apples. These conditions created a more\r\nstable market with more uniform prices, extending the business from a\r\nside issue to one of chief importance. Marketing has become almost a\r\nbusiness by itself, inducing the formation of growers' associations\r\nand creating a profitable occupation for large dealers and commission\r\nmen. These conditions, too, have led to speculation.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of storage are used, common or cellar storage and cold\r\nstorage. Both are about equally available, but the latter is too\r\nexpensive for the small grower. There is always a question as to the\r\nadvisability of the small grower storing his fruit. Storage means a\r\ndegree of speculation. \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,\"\r\nespecially when the bird is a good one. So far as rules can be laid\r\ndown, the following are pretty safe ones to keep in mind: It is safest\r\nto store apples when they are of the highest quality; in a season most\r\nunfavorable to common storage; when the fewest are being stored; when\r\nthe price in the fall is medium to low, never when high; and when one\r\ncan afford to lose the whole crop.\r\n\r\nSuccessful storage requires several things: good fruit, stored\r\nimmediately after picking, careful sorting and handling, subsequent\r\nrest, and a reasonable control of the temperature. The functions of\r\nstorage are to arrest ripening, retard the development of disease, and\r\nfurnish a uniform, cold temperature. Storage of apples does not remedy\r\nover-ripeness nor prevent deterioration of already diseased, bruised,\r\nor partly rotted fruit. There are three general methods of storage:\r\n(1) by ventilation, (2) by the use of ice and (3) by mechanical means.\r\n\r\nCooling by ventilation offers the most practical system for a farm\r\nstorage. It requires that there be perfect insulation against outside\r\ntemperature changes, adequate ventilation, and careful watching of\r\ntemperatures. To provide for good insulation a dead air space is\r\nnecessary. This can be secured by a course of good two-inch boards\r\nwith one or two layers of building paper inside and out, over a\r\nframework of two-by-fours. Over the building paper tight, well matched\r\nsiding should be laid also inside and out. Two of the dead air spaces\r\nwill make insulation doubly sure.\r\n\r\nTo provide for proper ventilation construct an intake for cold air at\r\nthe bottom, and an outlet for warm air at the top of the room. These\r\nshould serve all parts of the room, one being necessary for this\r\npurpose every twelve to sixteen feet. Do not depend too much on\r\nwindows. Warm-air flues should be twelve inches square and six to\r\ntwelve feet long.\r\n\r\nThe attention to such a house is most important. Keep it closed\r\ntightly early in the fall with blinded windows. When nights get cool\r\nopen the doors and windows to let in cold air, closing them again\r\nduring the day. On hot days close the ventilators also. In this way a\r\ntemperature of 36 to 40 degrees Fahr. can be secured in early fall and\r\none of 32 to 33 degrees Fahr. later. This is probably the cheapest as\r\nwell as the most practical method of farm storage.\r\n\r\nIce storage is quite practical in the North, but more expensive. The\r\nprinciple of such a storage is to keep ice above the fruit, allowing\r\nthe cold air to flow down the sides of the room. A shaft in the middle\r\nof the room will serve to remove the warm air. This method is open to\r\nthe objection of difficulty in storing the ice above the fruit.\r\nMoreover the uniformity of its cold air supply is questionable.\r\nMechanical storage in which cold temperatures are secured by the\r\ncompression or absorption of gases is altogether impracticable for\r\nindividual growers, as it costs from $1.50 to $2.00 a barrel of\r\ncapacity to construct such a storage. Rents of this kind of storage\r\nrange from 10 to 25 cents a barrel per month, or 25 to 50 cents a\r\nbarrel for the season of from four to six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMARKETS AND MARKETING\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving produced a good product, there remains the problem of making a\r\nprofitable and satisfactory disposition of it. In many ways marketing\r\nis the measure of successful fruit growing. Of what use is it to prune\r\nwell, cultivate well, spray thoroughly, or even pack well the finest\r\nkind of product, if after the expense of these operations is paid and\r\nthe railroad and commission agents have had their share, no profit\r\nremains to the producer? Many growers find it easier to produce good\r\nfruit than to market it at a good price, and this is especially true\r\nof the general farmer. Failure to market well spells failure in the\r\nbusiness of fruit growing. Successful marketing presupposes a\r\nknowledge of the requirements of different markets as to quality,\r\nvarieties, and supply demanded in those markets. Methods of\r\ndistribution are also one of the great factors in this problem of\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\nTYPES OF MARKETS.--There are two general types of markets, the local,\r\nwhich is a special market and the general or wholesale market, both of\r\nwhich have different but definite requirements. The local market\r\nhandles fruit in small quantities, but usually with a larger margin of\r\nprofit per unit to the producer. As a rule delivery is direct in a\r\nlocal market, and thus commissions are saved. Competition is also more\r\nor less limited to one's neighbors. More varieties, including less\r\nwell known ones, are called for. Appearance does not count for as much\r\nas quality, which is of first importance. Fruit may be riper as it is\r\nconsumed more quickly and meets with less rough handling. Packages are\r\nusually returned to the grower. Special markets are often willing to\r\npay extra for fruit out of season, and they always require special\r\nstudy and adaptation to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nThe general or wholesale market handles fruit in larger quantities,\r\nusually with a smaller margin of profit. A selling agent or commission\r\nman is the means of disposing of fruit in such a market, where\r\ncompetition is open to the whole country and sometimes to the world.\r\nOnly standard well-known varieties find a ready and profitable sale.\r\nGreat attention is paid to appearance and comparatively little to\r\nquality. Fruit shipped to a wholesale market must be packed in a\r\nstandard package, which is not returned, but goes with the fruit, and\r\nmust be packed so as to endure rough treatment. Out of season fruit is\r\nnot in demand, but even the general market sometimes has special\r\npreferences.\r\n\r\nAlmost every market has favorite varieties for which it is willing to\r\npay a larger price than other markets. Just as Boston wants a brown\r\negg and New York a white one, so these and other cities have their\r\nfavorite varieties of apples. Some markets prefer a red apple, others\r\na green one, although the former is most generally popular. In the\r\nmining and manufacturing towns working people want smaller green\r\napples, or \"seconds,\" because they are cheaper. Many second-class\r\nhotels prefer small apples, if they are well colored, as they go\r\nfarther. The fashionable restaurant and the fruit stand are the\r\nmarkets for large, perfect, and highly colored specimens. Housewives\r\ndemand cooking apples like Greenings, hotels want a good out-of-hand\r\napple like the McIntosh, while private families have their own\r\nspecial favorites. As will readily be seen, the producer's problem is\r\nto find the special market for what he grows.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that different markets have special varietal\r\npreferences, paying a better price for these than do other markets for\r\nthe same quality. We can only take the space here to point out a few\r\nof these preferences. The Baldwin is by all odds our best general\r\nmarket and export variety. It is the workingman's apple and finds its\r\nbest sale in our largest cities, particularly in New York and Chicago.\r\nThe Rhode Island Greening is a better seller in the northern markets\r\nthan it is in the southern, finding its best sale in Boston and in New\r\nYork. The Northern Spy is highly regarded by all our large northern\r\nand eastern markets, is fairly well liked by the middle latitude\r\nmarkets, but not popular south of Baltimore and Pittsburgh or west of\r\nMilwaukee.\r\n\r\nCentral western markets appear to prefer the Hubbardson, but this\r\napple is fairly good in all markets. King is well thought of nearly\r\neverywhere. Ben Davis is a favorite in the South, New Orleans\r\nespecially preferring it on account of its keeping quality. Jonathan\r\nhas a good reputation everywhere. Dutchess of Oldenburg is regarded\r\nas excellent in Buffalo and Chicago. Wealthy, although generally a\r\nlocal market apple, is well known and liked in all markets. Twenty\r\nOunce is spoken well of nearly everywhere. The Fameuse is not well\r\nliked in the South, but popular in the North, etc. These particular\r\nfacts as to varieties are best learned by experience and by\r\nobservation of the market quotations.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMISSION MAN.--The present system of marketing fruit products\r\nmakes the commission man almost a necessity in the general market.\r\nNeither the grower nor the local dealer can ship directly to the\r\nconsumer or even to the retailer, except in a very limited way. It may\r\nbe impracticable to devise any other workable system, but it must be\r\nremembered that every man who touches a barrel of apples on its\r\njourney from producer to consumer must be paid for doing so, and this\r\npay must come either out of the seller's price or be added to the\r\nbuyer's price. But so long as present conditions of marketing and\r\ndistribution prevail, so long will a selling agent in the general\r\nmarket be necessary, and the evil cannot be ameliorated by ranting\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\nAn unfortunate impression prevails that all commission men are\r\ndishonest. This is not true, although undoubtedly there are many\r\nscoundrels among them, as they have shippers almost completely at\r\ntheir mercy. The best method under our present system is to choose an\r\nhonest commission man in the city where you sell, to get acquainted\r\nwith him, to let him know that your trade will be in his hands only so\r\nlong as he treats you fairly, and then supply him with as good quality\r\nof stuff as you can produce. This plan has worked out well with many\r\nsuccessful growers and marketers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the greatest difficulty to be overcome in successfully finding\r\ngood markets is that of proper distribution. As has been pointed out\r\nin the previous chapter, there has been a great increase in the\r\nproduction of apples and hence in competition, accompanied by\r\nspeculation and more intensive methods in all phases of the business.\r\nA necessity has arisen for the production of the best at a minimum\r\ncost, as well as for finding the best market for that product. In the\r\nrush for the best market every seller is apt to be guided only by his\r\nown immediate interest without due regard for the fact that others are\r\nacting in the same way or that there is a future. The result is the\r\npiling up of fruit in a market of high quotations, and a subsequent\r\ndrop in the price. Then all turn from such a market to a better one\r\nwith the result that a famine often results where but a few weeks or\r\neven days before there had been a feast.\r\n\r\nThus it often happens that one market may have more fruit than it can\r\npossibly dispose of at the time, while another, perhaps equally good,\r\ngoes begging. Such conditions are ruinous to trade. Growers are\r\ndisappointed and ascribe the cause to the commission man. Consumers\r\nare unable many times to profit by a glut in the market but promptly\r\nblame the middleman or the grower when the supply is small and the\r\nprice high.\r\n\r\nOther difficulties with our system of marketing are non-uniformity of\r\nthe grades, the packages, or the fruit itself. There should be a clear\r\ndefinition of just what \"firsts\" and \"seconds\" are and this definition\r\nrigidly adhered to. Transportation is too frequently insufficient, not\r\nrapid enough, especially when perishable fruit is shipped in small\r\nlots, and usually at a too high rate. There are undoubtedly too many\r\nmiddlemen between producer and consumer. Growers sell to local dealers\r\nwho sell to wholesalers at the receiving end. These sell to\r\nwholesalers at the consuming end, who may sell to jobbers, who sell to\r\nretailers. Each man must have his profits, all of which greatly\r\nincreases costs.\r\n\r\nCO-OPERATION.--Individuals have practically no power to remedy such a\r\nstate of affairs. So long as producers act independently they will\r\nhave little power either to bring about favorable legislation or to\r\nbetter such market conditions. Acting together as a unit growers have\r\naccomplished great things which can be repeated. The co-operative\r\nprinciple has been well tried out in California, where it was first\r\nput into operation with citrous fruits, in several other Western\r\nStates with apples, and in Michigan and the Province of Ontario.\r\n\r\nCo-operative associations study carefully the law of supply and demand\r\nand take steps to adapt their shipments to it. They standardize the\r\ngrade, the package, and the fruit, and govern their shipments to given\r\nmarkets by the needs and the demands of those markets. Their unity of\r\neffort enables them to make great savings in the purchase of supplies,\r\nsuch as packages, spraying material, fertilizers, etc., and in\r\nobtaining and distributing frequently knowledge of markets and market\r\nconditions. They also advertise their products, making them better\r\nknown, creating a demand for them, and by means of correspondence or\r\ntraveling agents seek out the best markets.\r\n\r\nThere are now several large fruit exchanges operating over wide\r\nsections of country. But the local associations are the vital units in\r\nany co-operative movement. Such associations should be incorporated\r\nunder State laws so that they can do all sorts of business when\r\nnecessary. Six simple objects should be kept in mind, namely, (1) to\r\nprevent unnecessary competition, and to supervise and control\r\ndistribution of products; (2) to provide for uniformity in the grade,\r\npackage, and fruit; (3) to build up a high standard of excellence and\r\nto create a demand for it; (4) to economize in buying supplies and\r\nselling products; (5) to promote education regarding all phases of the\r\nfruit business; and (6) when necessary to act as a buying and selling\r\nagent for the community.\r\n\r\nSuch an association requires a board of directors, a treasurer, and an\r\nactive and well-paid manager. The latter is most important, as upon\r\nhis honesty, ability, and energy will largely depend the success or\r\nfailure of the organization. Sometimes where fruit is packed in a\r\ncentral packing house or under an association brand or guarantee, a\r\nforeman packer is also necessary. The capitalization required for such\r\nan enterprise is not necessarily large, unless warehouses or packing\r\nhouses are built. These are usually better rented until the\r\norganization becomes well established.\r\n\r\nThe shares should be small so that every member may be financially\r\nwell represented, and members should be prohibited from holding more\r\nthan a small percentage of the total shares, in order to prevent\r\npossible monopoly. Dividends on stock held should only be expected\r\nfrom business done outside the association membership, interest on\r\nmoney invested being obtained in the handling of members' products at\r\ncost. Receipts should be given growers for just what they bring in,\r\nand they should then be paid according to the grade of fruit which\r\nthey contribute, prices for the same grade being pooled. The charge to\r\ngrowers for handling should be actual cost, but outsiders' products\r\nshould be handled at a small profit in order to induce them to come\r\ninto the association. The same method should be followed in purchasing\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe general result of such co-operation is that the consumer gets a\r\nbetter product for his money and the grower receives a better price\r\nfor his product. It is very essential to the success of the\r\norganization that growers stick together, even through low prices and\r\ndiscouragement which so often come, until they are firmly established.\r\nSubstantial reduction in the cost of the product to consumers can only\r\ncome by similar co-operation among them at the buying end and by the\r\nco-operation of both consumers and producers for distribution and\r\nhandling in market.\r\n\r\nIf a neighborhood does not feel yet ready to attack this problem in\r\nthis thorough and businesslike way, it will be advantageous and a step\r\nin the right direction if they simply agree on certain standards of\r\nquality and packing and then pool their product for marketing. This\r\nmethod has also been followed with success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSOME HINTS ON RENOVATING OLD ORCHARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly every general farm in the humid part of the United States has\r\nits small, old apple orchard. For the most part these orchards were\r\nplanted in order to have a home source of supply of this popular\r\nfruit. In fact, but few orchards have been planted on a commercial\r\nscale with a view of selling the fruit, until recently and outside of\r\na few sections. Therefore, as a rule we find these old farm orchards\r\nto consist of a few acres containing from twenty-five to two hundred\r\ntrees. These trees are usually good standard varieties which have been\r\nthe source of much apple \"sass,\" many an apple pie, and many a barrel\r\nof cider-vinegar.\r\n\r\nNot having been set for profit, these trees received little care.\r\nOrchards were cropped in the regular rotation, or with hay, or\r\npastured. Farmers then knew little of modern methods of orchard\r\nmanagement. The orchard was regarded as an incumbrance to the land,\r\nwhich had to be farmed to as good advantage as possible under the\r\ncircumstances, and if the apple trees by any chance yielded a crop,\r\nthe owner regarded himself as fortunate indeed.\r\n\r\nBut conditions have now changed. Both local and foreign markets have\r\nbeen opened up and developed so that the demand for good fruit is\r\ngreat. It will be some time before the thousands of acres of orchards\r\nwhich have been and are being planted to meet this demand will be able\r\nto do so in any adequate way. It has been shown in Chapter I how heavy\r\nhas been the falling off in the supply, even in the face of these\r\nheavy plantings. Meanwhile we must turn to the old neglected farm\r\norchards for our supply of apples. Just at this particular time the\r\nrenovation of these old orchards offers a splendid opportunity to\r\nincrease the farm income.\r\n\r\nThe question is a live one on nearly every general farm in the East.\r\nWill it pay to try to renovate my old apple trees? If so, what should\r\nI do to make them profitable? What will it cost and what returns may\r\nbe expected? The latter question will be taken up in the following\r\nchapter, but here we must try to indicate under what conditions it\r\nmay pay to renovate an old orchard, as well as those under which it\r\nmay not pay, and also how to go about the problem.\r\n\r\nNECESSARY QUALITIES.--An apple orchard must have certain\r\nqualifications in order to make it worth while to spend the time and\r\nmoney necessary to accomplish the desired results. These we may take\r\nup briefly under five heads: (1) varieties, (2) age, (3) number or\r\n\"stand\" of trees, (4) vigor and health of the trees, and (5) soil,\r\nsite, and location. The discussion of these subjects in Chapters II\r\nand III has equal application here, but we may perhaps point out their\r\nspecific application more definitely in the case of the old neglected\r\nfarm orchard.\r\n\r\n(1) Varieties should be desirable sorts. If they are the best standard\r\nmarket varieties, as is often the case, so much the better. Otherwise\r\nlittle is gained by improving the tree and fruit. Poor or unknown\r\nvarieties have little or no market value, except perhaps a very local\r\none. If the trees are not too old and are fairly vigorous, poor\r\nvarieties may sometimes be worked over by top grafting to better\r\nvarieties. Characteristics which may make, a variety undesirable are:\r\ninferior quality; unattractiveness in color, shape, or size; lack of\r\nhardiness in the tree or keeping quality in the fruit; low yield; or\r\nbeing unknown in the market with its consequent small demand. Summer\r\nvarieties are worth renovating only when they are in good demand in a\r\nnearby local market.\r\n\r\n(2) Vigor is more important than age in the tree, but is closely\r\ncorrelated with it. Ordinarily one should hesitate to try to renovate\r\na tree more than forty or fifty years old, but this must always depend\r\nalmost wholly on its condition and other characteristics.\r\n\r\n(3) In order to make a business of renovation and to do thorough work\r\nwhich means expense, there must be enough of the orchard to justify\r\nthe expenditure of the time and money. This affects the results not\r\nonly in expense, but in economy in management, equipment, and\r\nmarketing. There should be at least an acre of say thirty trees, and\r\nbetter, more than that number to justify the expense of time and money\r\nnecessary for renovation. One hundred trees would certainly justify\r\nit, other conditions being favorable. Then, too, the trees should be\r\nin such shape that they can be properly treated without too great\r\ntrouble and expense, i.e., not too scattered or isolated or in the\r\nmidst of regular fields better adapted for other crops.\r\n\r\n(4) Vigor and good general health are of great importance. Many old\r\ntrees are too far gone with neglect, having been too long starved or\r\nhaving their vitality too much weakened by disease to make an effort\r\nfor their rehabilitation worth while. Good vigor, even though it be\r\ndormant, is absolutely essential. Disease weakens the tree, making the\r\nexpense of renovation greater. Moreover, all diseased branches must be\r\nremoved, requiring severe cutting and often seriously injuring the\r\ntree. Disease too often stunts the tree to such an extent as to make\r\nstimulation practically impossible. Such matters should be carefully\r\nlooked into before attempting renovation.\r\n\r\n(5) If the soil, site, and location are all unfavorable or even if two\r\nof these are not good, time and money are likely to be wasted on\r\nrenovation. What constitutes unfavorable conditions in these respects\r\nhas already been pointed out in Chapter III.\r\n\r\nPractically the same principles of pruning, cultivation, fertilization\r\nand spraying apply in the management of the old orchard as in any\r\nother orchard. It may be well, however, to restate these, briefly\r\npointing out their special value and application to the old neglected\r\norchard together with the few modifications of practice necessary. The\r\nsteps to be taken are four: (1) pruning, (2) fertilizing, (3)\r\ncultivating, and (4) spraying.\r\n\r\n(1) PRUNING.--Old and long-neglected apple orchards usually have a\r\nlarge amount of dead wood in them. This may be removed at any time of\r\nthe year, but fall and winter are good times to begin the work. If the\r\ntrees are high and the limbs scattered and sprawling so that the\r\nmiddle of the trees is not well filled out, the trees should be headed\r\nback rather severely. Such trees may safely have their highest limbs\r\ncut back from five to ten feet. It is best not to remove too many\r\nbranches in one year, but to spread severe cutting back over at least\r\ntwo years, as so much pruning at one time weakens the tree and causes\r\nan excessive growth of \"suckers.\" Each limb should be cut back to a\r\nrather strong and vigorous lateral branch which may then take up the\r\ngrowth of the upright one. The effect of such heading back will be to\r\nstimulate the branches lower down and probably to bring in more or\r\nless \"suckers.\" The following year the best of these suckers should\r\nbe selected at proper points about the tree, headed in so as to\r\ndevelop their lateral buds, and encouraged by the removal of all other\r\nsuckers to fill in the top and center of the tree in the way desired.\r\nAll such severe heading in should best be done in the early spring.\r\n\r\n(2) FERTILIZING.--At some time during the late fall or winter twelve\r\nto fifteen loads of stable manure should be applied broadcast on each\r\nacre, scattering it well out under the ends of the branches. This will\r\namount to a load to from three to five trees. In case manure is not\r\navailable, or sometimes even supplementary to it in cases where quick\r\nresults are wanted 100 to 200 pounds of nitrate of soda, 300 to 500\r\npounds of acid phosphate, and 150 to 200 pounds of sulphate or muriate\r\nof potash should be applied in two applications as a top dressing in\r\nspring, as soon as growth starts, and thoroughly worked into the soil.\r\nThis will give the trees an abundance of available plant food, which\r\nis usually badly needed, and help to stimulate them to a vigorous\r\ngrowth. Such heavy feeding may easily be overdone and should be\r\nadjusted according to conditions and the needs of the orchard.\r\n\r\n(3) CULTIVATING.--If the orchard has been in sod for a number of\r\nyears, as is often the case, it is usually best to plow it in the fall\r\nabout four inches deep, just deep enough to turn under the sod. By so\r\ndoing a large number of roots will probably be broken, but such injury\r\nwill be much more than offset by the stimulus to the trees the next\r\nseason. It is a good plan to apply the stable manure on the top of\r\nthis plowed ground early in the winter. Fall plowing gives a better\r\nopportunity for rotting the sod and exposes to the winter action of\r\nthe elements the soil, which is usually stale and inactive after lying\r\nso long unturned. In the spring the regular treatment with springtooth\r\nand spiketooth harrows should be followed as outlined in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n(4) SPRAYING in the old orchard is essentially the same as elsewhere.\r\nIt is necessary, however, to emphasize the first spray, the dormant\r\none, winter strength on the wood. This is the most important spray for\r\na neglected orchard and it should be very thoroughly applied. It is a\r\nsort of cleaning-up spray for scale, fungus, and insects which winter\r\non the bark. In orchards where the San Jose scale is bad a strong\r\nlime-sulphur spray should also be used in the late fall in order to\r\nmake doubly sure a thorough cleaning up. It is usually a pretty good\r\nplan to scrape old trees as high up as the rough, shaggy bark extends,\r\ndestroying the scrapings. For this purpose an old and dull hoe does\r\nvery well. This treatment will get rid of many insects by destroying\r\nthem and their winter quarters.\r\n\r\nPATCHING OLD TREES.--A few suggestions on patching up the weak places\r\nin an old tree may not be entirely out of place. The question is often\r\nasked, will it pay to fill up the decayed centers or sides of old\r\ntrees? If the tree is otherwise desirable to save, it usually will.\r\nScrape out all the dead and rotten material, cleaning down to the\r\nsound heart wood. Then fill up the cavity with a rough cement, being\r\ncareful to exclude all air and finishing with a smooth, sloping\r\nsurface so as to drain away all moisture. This treatment will probably\r\nprevent further decay and often acts as a substantial mechanical\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nTrees which are badly split or which have so grown that a heavy crop\r\nis likely to break them over should be braced with wires or bolts.\r\nWhere the limbs are close together a bolt driven right through them\r\nwith wide, strong washers at the ends is very effective in\r\nstrengthening the tree. Where limbs must be braced from one side of\r\nthe tree across to the other wires are the best to use. They may be\r\nfastened to bolts through the limbs with wide washers on the outside\r\nhooks on the inside, or by passing the wire around the branches. In\r\nthe latter case some wide, fairly rigid material such as tin, pieces\r\nof wood, or heavy leather should be used to protect the tree from the\r\nwire which would otherwise cut into the bark and perhaps girdle the\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nCOST.--For the benefit of those who would like to get some idea of the\r\nprobable cost of renovating old apple orchards, the following estimate\r\nmade by the writer in a recent government publication on this subject\r\nis given. This estimate has been carefully made up from actual records\r\nkept on several New York farms. Because these costs are very variable\r\naccording to the condition of the orchard, both maximum and minimum\r\namounts are given per acre for the first year only.\r\n\r\n                                             Minimum      Maximum\r\n                                              cost         cost\r\n\r\n Plowing                                      $2.00        $3.00\r\n Manure, 10 to 20 loads at $1, or their\r\n   equivalent in commercial fertilizer        10.00        20.00\r\n Hauling manure                                5.00        10.00\r\n Pruning and hauling brush                     5.00        10.00\r\n Disking or harrowing twice                    1.00         1.50\r\n Disking or harrowing 3d or 4th time            .50         1.00\r\n Cultivating two to four times                  .50         1.00\r\n Spraying once with L.S. dilution 1 to\r\n   9--material                                 2.00         4.00\r\n Spraying once, L.S., labor                    1.00         1.50\r\n Spraying second time with L.S. dilution\r\n   1 to 40, labor and material                 1.50         2.50\r\n Spraying third time with same                 1.50         2.50\r\n                                             ------       ------\r\n     Total cost                              $30.00       $57.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF GROWING APPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo factors have always operated to deter many persons from taking up\r\nfruit growing as a business or even as a side issue on the farm, and\r\nthey will probably continue to be an obstacle for more time to come.\r\nThese are the comparatively large investment required and the\r\nnecessarily long period of waiting before paying returns can be\r\nobtained. Farmers who have not gone into the business of fruit growing\r\nbecause they could not afford this heavy investment or to wait so long\r\nfor returns have been wise. Others who, though lacking the necessary\r\ncapital, still have planted heavily have learned to their sorrow the\r\nimportance of capital in the business both for the original investment\r\nand to carry the enterprise. And yet with sufficient capital and the\r\nproper conditions there is no more attractive or profitable line of\r\nagriculture than fruit growing.\r\n\r\nWho knows what it costs to grow an orchard to bearing age? Or what it\r\ncosts to produce a barrel of apples? We venture to say that very few\r\npersons do. Because of the large investment both in fixed and in\r\nworking capital it is most important to know these costs. Moreover an\r\naccurate knowledge of the financial conditions and facts in any\r\nbusiness is of first importance to intelligent management. For these\r\nreasons every grower ought to keep careful records of the cost and\r\nincome from each field or orchard every year in order to determine as\r\naccurately as possible what his crops have cost him per unit and per\r\nacre and what rate of interest he has realized on his investment. As\r\nfarming becomes more intensive competition increases, costs multiply,\r\nand the margin of profit on any given unit becomes smaller. It\r\ntherefore becomes increasingly necessary to have accurate records on\r\nthe cost of production.\r\n\r\nFACTORS IN THE COST OF PRODUCTION.--The value of records depends on\r\ntheir accuracy and on their completeness. There are a great many\r\nfactors which enter into the cost of production. For convenience these\r\nmay be classified as cash costs and labor costs. Labor charges should\r\ninclude the work of both men and teams at a rate determined by their\r\nactual cost or by a careful estimate. Man labor costs are easily\r\nreckoned, as they are either simple cash or cash plus board and\r\ncertain privileges, the value of which should be estimated in cash.\r\n\r\nThe value of horse labor is more difficult to determine. It is made up\r\nof interest on valuation, depreciation, stable rental, feed, care,\r\netc. A fair estimate of this cost is $10 a month or $120 a year for a\r\nhorse. Cash costs are interest on the investment and on the equipment\r\nin machinery, etc., or rental of the same, taxes, a proper share of\r\nthe general farm expenses such as insurance and repairs of buildings,\r\ntelephone, etc., the cost of spraying material, packages, fertilizers,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of keeping such a record. Any method which\r\naccomplishes the result in a convenient and accurate manner is a good\r\none. It will usually be found necessary to keep a cash account or day\r\nbook, entering all items in enough detail to make possible their later\r\ndistribution to the proper field or crop, and also to keep a diary of\r\nall labor. Any form of diary will answer the purpose, but one which\r\nhas ruled columns at the right side of the page in which to indicate\r\nthe crop or field worked upon, and the number of hours worked is more\r\nconvenient and therefore more desirable.\r\n\r\nAN EXAMPLE.--For a number of years the author has kept such records on\r\nhis farm in western New York. As an illustration of the method and in\r\norder to give the reader a general idea as to what the costs above\r\nreferred to are likely to be we venture to give the following tables.\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that practically everyone of the above\r\nmentioned factors varies with the conditions under which the orchard\r\nis managed and that these figures are not _an_ average but _one_\r\naverage and on one farm. True averages are arrived at only by bringing\r\ntogether a large number of figures. In any case, the question of cost\r\nis essentially an individual problem on every farm. These figures are\r\nof value only as an example of the method and the cost on one farm\r\nunder its own special conditions.\r\n\r\nThe orchard for which the following figures were given was set in the\r\nspring of 1903, and the records begin with that year and end with\r\n1910, covering a period of eight years in all. Throughout this period\r\nother crops have been grown between the tree rows, thereby offsetting\r\nto a large extent the cost of growing the orchard. Forty trees at the\r\nnorth end of the orchard are pears, but they have received\r\nsubstantially the same treatment as the apples and have not affected\r\nthe cost. In 1904, 211 plum trees were set as fillers one way. The\r\napple trees were set 36 by 36 feet apart, so that, filled one way, the\r\ntrees stand 18 by 36 feet apart. The orchard is ten rows wide and\r\nforty-seven long, containing in all 467 trees.\r\n\r\nBRINGING TO BEARING AGE.--The first of the following tables is given\r\nas a sample of one year's records, that of 1907, on this orchard in\r\norder to show both the manner in which the costs were made up and what\r\nthe items amounted to in one year:\r\n\r\nFIELD A--1907.

It is safe to\r\nsay that the orchard would have cost even more than it did had it not\r\nbeen for the crops, for many operations charged directly to the crops\r\nwould of necessity have been charged to the trees. The cost a hundred\r\ntrees does not mean much, as it often happens that not all the trees\r\nare covered by an operation and as the number of trees an acre greatly\r\naffects these costs.\r\n\r\nWe have another and younger orchard upon which a record has been kept.\r\nThis orchard of five acres contains 126 standard apple trees,\r\n\"filled\" both ways with 375 peach trees. It was set in the spring of\r\n1908, so that the trees have grown four seasons. The permanents\r\n(apples) are set 36 by 40 feet apart, so that, with the peaches\r\nbetween, the trees stand 18 by 20 feet apart. A crop of beans has been\r\ngrown between the tree rows each season. The first season a full seven\r\nrows, twenty-eight inches apart, were planted in the wider space; the\r\nsecond and third season six rows, and the last season only four rows.\r\nThe crop has been very good each year until the last. One application\r\nof manure, one crop of clover and one seeding of rye have been plowed\r\nunder, and in addition a liberal amount of commercial fertilizer has\r\nbeen used with each crop. This year the peach trees bore their first\r\ncrop. The record of the four years is as follows:\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE COST OF A FOUR-YEAR-OLD APPLE AND PEACH ORCHARD\r\n\r\n                       Net      Income\r\n       Crop          income      from      Cost of\r\nYear   grown        from crop   orchard    orchard    Profit     Loss\r\n\r\n1908   Beans        $63.37        ...      $130.12     ...     $62.75\r\n1909   Beans         66.70        ...       $85.03     ...      18.33\r\n1910   Beans         79.81        ...        83.39     ...       3.58\r\n1911   Beans         53.20      $46.05       61.95   $37.30      ...\r\n                   -------      ------     -------   ------    ------\r\n  Totals           $267.08      $46.05     $360.49   $37.30    $84.66\r\n\r\nTotal cost an acre, exclusive of income                        $72.10\r\nTotal cost an acre, including income                             9.47\r\nTotal net cost a hundred trees                                   4.73\r\nTotal net cost an apple tree                                      .376\r\nTotal net cost an apple tree, exclusive of income                2.86\r\n\r\nThese figures show a still lower cost of growing trees to bearing age.\r\nAfter paying all expenses connected with the growing of the trees,\r\nincluding the interest on the land at $150 an acre, and deducting the\r\nnet profit from the crops of beans and the sales from the first crop\r\nof peaches we find that the growing of the trees has cost us $9.47 an\r\nacre, or 371/2 cents an apple tree at four years old. Had no crop been\r\ngrown in the orchard it would have cost us at least $62.89 an acre\r\nafter deducting the income from the first peach crop. The peach trees\r\nare now at full bearing age, and should show a good profit from this\r\ntime on. Possibly at five and certainly at six years of age this\r\norchard will entirely have paid for itself. The only possible further\r\ncharge which could be made against this orchard is the crop income\r\nwhich might have been obtained from the land had the trees not been\r\nthere. We estimated that the presence of the trees cut down the crop\r\nof beans from the land 30 per cent. As the average net income from\r\nbeans was $13.35 an acre this would amount to $4 an acre a year--an\r\ninsignificant sum.\r\n\r\nIN BEARING.--Having given the reader an idea of the probable cost of\r\nbringing an orchard to bearing age, it may be well also to give the\r\ncost of producing apples in a mature apple orchard. Our bearing apple\r\norchard consists of 6.1 acres containing 234 trees. About one-half of\r\nthe trees, or 110, are 36 years old. The remainder are nearly 50 years\r\nof age. As they are all in one block and handled together, the charges\r\ncannot well be separated. One hundred and thirty-four of the trees are\r\nBaldwins, 44 Twenty Ounce, 40 Tompkins County Kings, and the remainder\r\nodd varieties. For the whole period of ten years the orchard has had\r\nvery good care and attention.\r\n\r\nA cover crop was not sown every year, but when it was used the charge\r\nwas made against the orchard. The manure charge, omitted because of\r\nuncertainty as to the exact amount applied and as to its real value,\r\nis the only thing lacking in this table.\r\n\r\nTwo or three sprayings have been made every year. Until 1909, Bordeaux\r\nmixture and Paris green were used, but since then the commercial\r\nbrands of lime sulphur and arsenate of lead have taken their place,\r\nnearly doubling the cost of the spray material. The average cost of\r\nthe material for spraying has been $2.50 per acre, or nearly three and\r\none-half cents per barrel of apples harvested. In 1910 this cost was\r\n$3.92 per acre and seven cents a barrel.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING THE ITEMS OF EXPENSE IN PRODUCING APPLES IN A SIX ACRE\r\nORCHARD\r\n\r\n-------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------\r\n       |      |        |       |  5%   |       |       |        |\r\n       | Cover|Spraying|       | int.  | Equip.| O'vh'd|  Labor | Total\r\nYear   | crop |mat.    | Bar.  |on inv.|charge |charge | cost   | cost\r\n-------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------\r\n1902   |      |$6.64   |$117.88|$27.45 |$25.00 |$2.97  |$339.45 |$519.39\r\n1903   |      |11.22   | 164.92| 28.88 | 25.00 | 2.88  | 249.55 | 482.56\r\n1904   |      |10.50   | 109.90| 30.50 | 25.00 | 3.93  | 180.55 | 360.38\r\n1905   |$6.10 |12.45   |  88.80| 30.50 | 25.00 | 3.40  | 158.06 | 324.31\r\n1906   |      |14.85   | 112.35| 33.06 | 25.00 | 4.78  | 211.76 | 401.80\r\n1907   |10.00 |16.85   |  79.80| 35.56 | 25.00 | 4.89  | 192.30 | 364.40\r\n1908   |      | 9.75   | 205.45| 37.76 | 30.09 | 5.09  | 293.50 | 583.55\r\n1909   | 8.68 |19.26   | 196.35| 41.97 | 38.98 | 5.91  | 280.78 | 591.93\r\n1910   |      |23.89   | 116.90| 45.75 | 32.39 | 5.58  | 175.26 | 399.77\r\n1911   |10.50 |27.08   | 206.38| 45.75 | 32.39*| 5.53* | 275.00*| 602.63\r\n-------+------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+--------+--------\r\n10 yr. av.    $15.25    $139.87  $35.73 $28.37  $4.78   $235.62  $463.07\r\nAv. per acre    2.50      22.93    5.86   4.65    .78     38.63    75.92\r\nAv. per bbl      .036       .327    .084   .066   .011      .552   -1.08\r\n\r\n* Partly estimated, records not yet complete.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe cost of the package has varied from 28 to 38 cents and has\r\naveraged about 321/2 cents, or $22.93 per acre. Of course the latter\r\namount varies greatly with the crop.\r\n\r\nInterest has in all cases been figured at five per cent., but as the\r\nprice of the land has varied from $90 an acre at the beginning of the\r\nperiod to its present valuation of $160,00 an acre, due both to its\r\nimprovement and to a general increase in the price of land, the\r\namount of interest has also varied. The same is true of the equipment\r\ncharge which has steadily increased each year. The average valuation\r\nof the land for the ten-year period was $117.15 an acre. This means an\r\nannual interest charge of $5.86 per acre, or 81/2 cents a barrel. The\r\nequipment charge, which is interest, repairs, and depreciation on the\r\nmachinery used in the orchard, amounts to more than 61/2 cents a barrel,\r\nor $4.65 per acre. Taxes and insurance on the buildings distributed\r\nper acre for the farm average $.78 per acre, or a trifle over one cent\r\nper barrel. These costs have also increased in the last few years.\r\n\r\nLabor is the largest single item. For the first four years this was\r\nestimated on the basis of the cost for the last six years, for which\r\nmore careful records were kept. It is computed at its actual cost to\r\nus on the farm, which was 151/2 cents an hour for men and 131/2 cents an\r\nhour for horses. This amounts to $4.25 per day for man and team. The\r\ncost of the labor to grow, pick, pack, and market a barrel of apples\r\nwas 55 cents, or $38.63 per acre with an average yield of 70 barrels\r\nper acre.\r\n\r\nTo sum up these items of cost we find that taking the average of ten\r\nyears with an annual crop of 427 barrels, or 70 per acre, on 6.1 acres\r\nof old apple orchard that the costs per barrel have been as follows:\r\nspray material, $.036; packages, $.327; interest on the land, $.084;\r\nuse of equipment, $.066; taxes, $.011; labor, $.552; and a total of\r\n$1.08 per barrel. If the estimated cost of manure, six cents a barrel\r\nbe added, the total will be $1.14. As we have said, these costs per\r\nbarrel vary with the crop. When our yield was 100 barrels per acre the\r\ncost per barrel was only $.99, but when it was 34 barrels per acre\r\nthis cost rose to $1.73 per barrel. In 1910 we grew a crop of 55\r\nbarrels per acre for $1.20 per barrel.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to some to know what the income and profit were\r\non this orchard. For this purpose we give the following table showing\r\nthe yield, income, cost, and net profit for each of the ten years, and\r\nthe average:\r\n\r\n        Yield in    Income   Income         Cost     Net     Profit\r\n        bbls.       bbls.    inc. culls     per      bbls.   inc. culls\r\n Year   per A.      only     and drops      bbl.     alone   and drops\r\n 1902   103         $1.96*   $1.46*         $.83     $1.13     $.63\r\n 1903    71          1.90     2.23          1.11       .79     1.12\r\n 1904    51          1.66     1.78          1.15       .51      .63\r\n 1905    49          2.30     2.68          1.10      1.20     1.58\r\n 1906    53          1.96     2.25          1.25       .71     1.30\r\n 1907    34          3.49     4.10          1.73      1.76     2.37\r\n 1908    96          2.03     2.32           .99      1.04     1.33\r\n 1909    92          3.00     3.38          1.06      1.94     2.32\r\n 1910    55          2.69     3.03          1.20      1.49     1.83\r\n 1911   100          2.06     2.32           .99¤     1.07¤    1.33¤\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n10 yr.\r\n av.     70          2.15     2.47          1.08      1.07     1.39\r\n\r\n  * In arriving at these incomes different divisors were used.
