Yet it is one of the few sciences for which most\r\npresent-day educators seem to find little, if any, room in their\r\ncurriculum of study for the young, in spite of its high cultural\r\nvalue. It is, we are told, too abstruse a subject for the youthful\r\nstudent. This is doubtless true of theoretical or mathematical\r\nastronomy and the practical astronomy of the navigator, surveyor and\r\nengineer, but it is not true of general, descriptive astronomy. There\r\nare many different aspects of this many-sided science, and some of\r\nthe simplest and grandest truths of astronomy can be grasped by the\r\nintelligent child of twelve or fourteen years of age.\r\n\r\nMerely as a branch of nature study the child should have some\r\nknowledge of the sun, moon, stars and planets, their motions and\r\ntheir physical features, for they are as truly a part of nature as\r\nare the birds, trees and flowers, and the man, woman or child who\r\ngoes forth beneath the star-lit heavens at night absolutely blind to\r\nthe wonders and beauties of the universe of which he is a part, loses\r\nas much as the one who walks through field or forest with no thought\r\nof the beauties of nature that surround him.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer is the pioneer and explorer of today in realms\r\nunknown just as the pioneers and explorers of several centuries ago\r\nwere to some extent astronomers as they sailed unknown seas and\r\ntraversed unexplored regions. As the years pass by the astronomer\r\nextends more and more his explorations of the universe and brings\r\nback among the fruits of discovery measures of giant suns and\r\nestimates of the form and extent of the universe, views of whirling,\r\nseething nebulæ, mysterious dark clouds drifting through space,\r\ntremendous solar upheavals or glimpses of strangely marked surfaces\r\nof nearby planets.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages the author has endeavored to tell in words\r\nnot beyond the comprehension of the average fourteen-year-old child\r\nsomething of the nature of the heavenly bodies. In Part I an effort\r\nis made to make the child familiar with the stars by indicating when\r\nand where they can be found in the early evening hours. In addition\r\nto identifying the principal constellations and their brightest stars\r\nby means of diagrams an attempt has been made to acquaint the child\r\nwith the most interesting recent discoveries that have been made\r\nconcerning the principal stars or objects in each group as well as\r\nwith some of the stories and legends that have been associated with\r\nthese groups of stars for centuries, and that have been handed down\r\nin the folk-lore of all nations.\r\n\r\nChapters 2-13, inclusive, appeared originally with diagrams similar\r\nto those shown here, under the department of Nature and Science\r\nfor Young Folk in _St. Nicholas_ from May, 1921, to April, 1922,\r\ninclusive. The Introductory Chapter and Chapters 14 and 15, on the\r\nMilky Way and Stars of the Southern Hemisphere, respectively, are\r\npublished here for the first time, as is also the chapter in Part II\r\non the Evolution of the Stars from Red Giants to Red Dwarfs, which\r\ngives the order of the evolution of the stars as now accepted as a\r\nresult of the brilliant astronomical researches of Dr. Henry Norris\r\nRussell of the United States and Prof. A. S. Eddington, of England.\r\n\r\nThe remaining chapters in Part II have been chosen from a series of\r\narticles that have appeared in _Science and Invention_, formerly\r\n_The Electrical Experimenter_, in the past four years, and have been\r\nconsiderably revised and in some parts rewritten to adapt them to the\r\nunderstanding of more youthful readers. These chapters deal with a\r\nvariety of astronomical subjects of general popular interest and an\r\neffort has been made to select subjects that would cover as wide an\r\nastronomical field as possible in a limited space.\r\n\r\nThe author's aim has not been to write a text-book of astronomy or\r\nto treat in detail of any one aspect of this extensive science, but\r\nsimply to give the average child some general knowledge of the nature\r\nof the heavenly bodies, both those that form a part of our own solar\r\nsystem and those that lie in the depths of space beyond.\r\n\r\nIt has been necessary to write very briefly, and we feel\r\ninadequately, of many topics of special interest such as the sun and\r\nmoon. Books have been written on these two subjects alone as well as\r\nupon such subjects as Mars, eclipses, comets, meteors, etc., but the\r\nobject has been to acquaint the child with the outstanding features\r\nof a variety of celestial objects rather than to treat of a few in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nIf the writer succeeds in arousing the child's interest in the stars\r\nso that he may look forth with intelligence at the heavens and\r\ngreet the stars as friends and at the same time grasps some of the\r\nsimplest and most fundamental of astronomical truths such as the\r\ndistinction between stars and planets, the motions of the heavenly\r\nbodies and their relative distances from us and the place of our own\r\nplanet-world in the universe, this book will have served its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             ASTRONOMY\r\n          FOR YOUNG FOLKS\r\n\r\n  \"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth\r\n  His handiwork.\"\r\n\r\n                                        Psalm XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTELLATIONS\r\n\r\n    \"Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades\r\n    Or loose the bands of Orion?\r\n    Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season\r\n    Or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?\"\r\n\r\n                                    --BOOK OF JOB.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho would not like to know the stars and constellations by their\r\nnames and in their seasons as we know the birds and the trees and\r\nthe flowers, to recognize at their return, year by year, Sirius and\r\nSpica, Arcturus and Antares, Vega and Altair, to know when Ursa Major\r\nswings high overhead and Orion sinks to rest beneath the western\r\nhorizon, when Leo comes into view in the east or the Northern Crown\r\nlies overhead?\r\n\r\nOften we deprive ourselves of the pleasure of making friends with the\r\nstars and shut our eyes to the glories of the heavens above because\r\nwe do not realize how simple a matter it is to become acquainted with\r\nthe various groups of stars as they cross our meridian, one by one,\r\nday after day and month after month in the same orderly sequence.\r\nWhen the robin returns once more to nest in the same orchard in the\r\nspring time, Leo and Virgo may be seen rising above the eastern\r\nhorizon in the early evening hours. When the first snow flies in\r\nthe late fall and the birds have all gone southward the belt of\r\nOrion appears in the east and Cygnus dips low in the west. When we\r\nonce come to know brilliant blue-white Vega, ruddy Arcturus, golden\r\nCapella and sparkling Sirius we watch for them to return each in its\r\nproper season and greet them as old friends.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we give for each month the constellations\r\nor star-groups that are nearest to our meridian, that is, that lie\r\neither due north or due south or exactly overhead in the early part\r\nof the month and the early part of the evening.\r\n\r\nWe do not need to start our study of the constellations in January.\r\nWe may start at any month in the year and we will find the\r\nconstellations given for that month on or near the meridian at the\r\ntime indicated.\r\n\r\nIn using the charts or diagrams of the constellations, we should hold\r\nthem in an inverted position with the top of the page toward the\r\nnorth or else remember that the left-hand side of the page is toward\r\nthe _east_ and the right-hand side of the page toward the _west_,\r\nwhich is the opposite of the arrangement for charts and maps of the\r\nearth's surface.\r\n\r\nWe should also bear in mind that the constellations are all\r\ncontinually shifting westward for the stars and the moon and the\r\nplanets as well as the sun rise daily in the east and set in the\r\nwest. This is due to the fact that the earth is turning in the\r\nopposite direction on its axis, that is from west to east. In\r\ntwenty-four hours the earth turns completely around with respect to\r\nthe heavens or through an angle of 360°, so in one hour it turns\r\nthrough an angle of 360° ÷ 24 or 15°. As a result the stars appear\r\nto shift westward 15° every hour. This is a distance about equal in\r\nlength to the handle of the Big Dipper, which I am sure we all know,\r\neven if we do not know another constellation in the heavens.\r\n\r\nIf, then, we look at the heavens at a later hour than that for which\r\nthe constellations are given we will find them farther westward and\r\nif our time of observation is earlier in the evening than the hour\r\nmentioned we will find them farther eastward.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a year the earth makes one trip around the sun and\r\nfaces in turn all parts of the heavens. That is, it turns through\r\nan angle of 360° with respect to the heavens in a year or through\r\nan angle of 360° ÷ 12 or 30° in one month. So as a result of our\r\nrevolution around the sun, which is also in a west to east direction,\r\nwe see that all the constellations are gradually shifting westward at\r\nthe rate of 30° a month. It is for this reason that we see different\r\nconstellations in different months, and it is because of the turning\r\nof the earth on its axis that we see different constellations at\r\ndifferent hours of the night.\r\n\r\nIf we should sit up from sunset to sunrise and watch the stars rise\r\nin the east, pass the meridian and set in the west--as the sun does\r\nby day--we should see in turn the same constellations that are to\r\npass across the heavens in the next six months. This is because in\r\ntwelve hours' time we are carried through the same angle with respect\r\nto the heavens by the earth's rotation on its axis that we are in the\r\nnext six months by the motion of the earth around the sun.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose then that the time we choose for our observation of\r\nthe heavens is the last of the month while our charts are given\r\nfor the first of the month. We must look then farther westward\r\nfor our constellations just as we must look farther westward if\r\nwe chose a later hour in the evening for our observations. Let us\r\nsuppose that we choose for our time of observation half-past eight\r\nin the early part of December. On or close to the meridian we will\r\nfind the constellations outlined in the charts for December. To\r\nthe east of the meridian we will find the constellations that are\r\ngiven for January and February, and to the west of the meridian\r\nthe constellations that are given for November and October. So if\r\nwe are particularly ambitious or wish to become acquainted with\r\nthe constellations more rapidly we may study at the same time the\r\nconstellations for the preceding months now west of the meridian and\r\nthe constellations for the following months now east of the meridian\r\nas well as the constellations for the month which will be due north\r\nor south or directly overhead as the case may be.\r\n\r\nIf we were able to see the stars by day as well as by night we\r\nwould observe that as the days go by the sun is apparently moving\r\ncontinuously eastward among certain constellations. This is a result\r\nof the earth's actual motion around the sun in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe apparent path of the sun among the stars is called the ecliptic\r\nand the belt of the heavens eight degrees wide on either side of the\r\necliptic is called the zodiac. The constellations that lie within\r\nthis belt of the zodiac are called zodiacal constellations. The\r\nzodiac was divided by the astronomer Hipparchus, who lived 161-126\r\nB.C., into twelve signs 30° wide, and the signs were named for the\r\nconstellations lying at that time within each of these divisions.\r\nThese zodiacal constellations are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,\r\nVirgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius and Pisces.\r\nWith the exception of Libra, the Scales, all of these constellations\r\nare named for people or animals and the word zodiac is derived from\r\nthe Greek word meaning \"of animals.\"\r\n\r\nEach month the sun moves eastward 30° through one of these zodiacal\r\nconstellations. In the days of Hipparchus the sun was in Aries at\r\nthe beginning of spring, at the point where the ecliptic crosses the\r\ncelestial equator--which lies directly above the earth's equator.\r\nThis point where the ecliptic crosses the equator was then known\r\nas the First Point in Aries. The autumnal equinox was 180° distant\r\nin Aquarius and the two points were called the equinoxes because\r\nwhen the sun is at either equinox the day and night are equal in\r\nlength all over the world. Now for certain reasons which we will not\r\nexplain here the equinoctial points are not fixed in position but\r\nshift gradually westward at the rate of 1° in 70 years. It is as if\r\nthe equinoxes were advancing each year to meet the sun on its return\r\nand their westward motion is therefore called \"The Precession of the\r\nEquinoxes.\"\r\n\r\nSince the days of Hipparchus this motion has amounted to about 30° so\r\nthat the constellations no longer occupy the signs of the zodiac that\r\nbear their names.\r\n\r\nThe sun is now in Pisces instead of Aries at the beginning of spring\r\nand in Virgo instead of Aquarius at the beginning of fall.\r\n\r\nNot only the sun but the moon and planets as well move through the\r\nzodiacal constellations. In fact a limit for the zodiac of 8° on\r\neither side of the ecliptic was chosen because it marks the extent\r\nof the excursions of the moon and planets from the ecliptic. Neither\r\nmoon nor planets will be found at a greater distance than 8° on\r\neither side of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in determining the positions of the heavenly bodies\r\nthe astronomer assumes that they lie upon the surface of a celestial\r\nsphere that has its center at the center of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe north pole of the celestial sphere lies directly above the north\r\npole of the earth and the south pole of the celestial sphere directly\r\nabove the south pole of the earth. The celestial equator is the\r\ngreat circle of the celestial sphere that lies midway between its\r\nnorth and south poles and directly above the earth's equator. The\r\necliptic is also a great circle of the celestial sphere and cuts the\r\ncelestial equator at an angle of 23-1/2° in the two points 180° apart\r\nknown as the equinoctial points, of which we have already spoken.\r\n\r\nThe zodiacal constellations lie nearly overhead within the tropics\r\nand can be seen to advantage all over the world except in polar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nFor every position of the earth's surface except at the equator we\r\nhave also our circumpolar constellations which are the ones that\r\nnever pass below the horizon for the place of observation.\r\n\r\nIn 40° N. Latitude the Big Dipper is a circumpolar constellation for\r\nit is above the horizon at all hours of the day and night and all\r\ntimes of the year. If our latitude is 40° N., all stars within 40° of\r\nthe north pole of the heavens are circumpolar and never set, while\r\nstars within 40° of the south pole of the heavens never rise. All\r\nother stars rise and set daily.\r\n\r\nIf we were at the north pole all stars within 90° of the north pole\r\nof the heavens would be circumpolar and would describe daily circuits\r\nof the pole parallel to the horizon remaining always above it.\r\n\r\nIf we were at the equator all stars within _zero_ degrees of either\r\npole would be circumpolar, that is _no_ stars would be circumpolar,\r\nall stars rising and setting daily.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, then, we may say that stars within an angular\r\ndistance of the nearest pole of the heavens equal to the latitude\r\nnever set and stars within an equal distance of the opposite pole\r\nnever rise while all stars outside of these limits rise and set daily.\r\n\r\nThe beginner who attempts to make the acquaintance of the principal\r\nstars and constellations occasionally may find a bright star in a\r\nconstellation that is not noted in the diagrams. In this case he has\r\nprobably happened upon one of the bright planets.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to include the planets in our diagrams for the\r\nreason that they are not fixed in position but apparently wander\r\namong the stars. The name planet is, in fact, derived from a Greek\r\nword meaning \"wanderer.\" The stars shine by their own light but the\r\nplanets shine only by reflected light from the sun. Of the seven\r\nplanets in the solar system additional to our own planet earth,\r\nthere are two, Uranus and Neptune that we need not consider for\r\nNeptune is not visible without the aid of a telescope and Uranus is\r\nfainter than any of the stars included in our diagrams.\r\n\r\nMercury will never appear except in the morning or evening twilight,\r\nwhen none but the very brightest stars are visible, since it never\r\ndeparts far from the sun. It will only be seen under certain\r\nfavorable conditions, and usually it will escape our notice\r\naltogether unless we know exactly where to look for it although\r\nthere are but two or three stars in the heavens that surpass it in\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nVenus, we will probably never mistake for any star in the heavens for\r\nit far surpasses all stars in brightness. It will always be seen in\r\nthe west after sunset or in the east before sunrise and it is never\r\nseen more than three hours before or after the sun.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us but three planets, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars that we\r\nmay mistake for bright stars. There is little chance that Jupiter\r\nwill be thus mistaken for it also is far brighter than all of the\r\nstars except Sirius which differs greatly from Jupiter in color.\r\nSirius is a brilliant white and Jupiter is a golden yellow. The\r\nplanets do not twinkle as the stars do and this is particularly true\r\nof Jupiter which is remarkable for the quiet steadiness of its yellow\r\nlight. This alone would serve to identify it.\r\n\r\nSaturn is probably mistaken for a star oftener than any of the other\r\nplanets. It moves so slowly among the stars that we would have to\r\nwatch it for a number of successive evenings before we could discover\r\nthat it is moving with respect to the stars. Saturn is yellowish in\r\ncolor and we can probably best distinguish it by the steadiness of\r\nits light. If we find in one of the zodiacal groups of stars--for\r\nthe planets appear among no other constellations--a bright yellowish\r\nstar where no bright star is indicated on the diagram we may be\r\nreasonably certain that we have found the planet Saturn.\r\n\r\nMars is the only planet that is reddish in color. Once in fifteen\r\nor seventeen years, when it is particularly near to the earth, it\r\nsurpasses even Jupiter in brightness, but ordinarily it appears\r\nno more brilliant than one of the brighter stars. There are only\r\ntwo stars with which we are likely to confuse Mars,--Aldebaran and\r\nAntares--which are very similar to it in color, and, at times, in\r\nbrightness. Moreover, both of these stars are zodiacal stars and Mars\r\nfrequently passes through the constellations to which they belong.\r\nThere should be no trouble about identifying Aldebaran and Antares,\r\nhowever, from their distinctive positions in the diagrams so that any\r\nother reddish star appearing in any of the zodiacal groups we may\r\nfeel certain is the planet Mars.\r\n\r\nIn the following diagrams of the constellations the brightest\r\nand most conspicuous stars, called first-magnitude stars, are\r\nrepresented by white stars. These are the stars we should all be\r\nable to recognize and call by name and in every instance the name of\r\na first-magnitude star is given on the diagram. All other stars are\r\nrepresented by circles, and the size of the circle is an indication\r\nof the brightness of the star.\r\n\r\nStars visible without the aid of a telescope are referred to usually\r\nas \"naked-eye stars.\" They are classed as first, second, third,\r\nfour, fifth or sixth magnitude stars, according to their relative\r\nbrightness. A star of the first magnitude is about two and one-half\r\ntimes brighter than a star of the second magnitude, which in turn is\r\ntwo and one-half times brighter than a star of the third magnitude\r\nand so on. A first-magnitude star is, then, one hundred times\r\nbrighter than a sixth magnitude star which is the faintest star that\r\ncan be seen without the aid of the telescope.\r\n\r\nThis ratio between successive magnitudes continues among the\r\ntelescopic stars. A star of the sixth magnitude is one hundred times\r\nbrighter than a star of the eleventh magnitude which in turn is one\r\nhundred times brighter than a star of the sixteenth magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe faintest stars that can be seen visually in the greatest\r\ntelescopes are of the seventeenth or eighteenth magnitude, though\r\nstars two or three magnitudes fainter can be photographed.\r\n\r\nThe faintest stars shown in the diagrams are fifth-magnitude stars\r\nand stars of this magnitude as well as stars of the fourth magnitude\r\nare only given when needed to fill out the distinctive outlines of\r\nthe constellations which have been formed by connecting the principal\r\nstars in each group by dotted lines.\r\n\r\nAll stars of first, second and third magnitude are given in the\r\ndiagrams without exceptions as such stars are visible to everyone on\r\nclear nights.\r\n\r\nThe constellations given in the following pages include practically\r\nall of the constellations that can be seen in 40° N. Latitude. A\r\ndiagram is given for each constellation.\r\n\r\nIn this latitude it is impossible to see the constellations of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere that lie within 40° of the south pole of the\r\nheavens. A brief chapter with diagram treats of these constellations\r\nthat are invisible in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nJANUARY\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most easily recognized constellations in the heavens is\r\nTaurus, The Bull, a zodiacal group which lies just south of the\r\nzenith in our latitudes in the early evening hours about the first of\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nTaurus is distinguished by the V-shaped group of The Hyades,\r\nwhich contains the bright, red, first-magnitude star Aldebaran,\r\nrepresenting the fiery eye of the bull. It also contains the famous\r\ncluster of faint stars known as The Pleiades, lying a short distance\r\nnorthwest of The Hyades.\r\n\r\nNo group of stars is more universally known than The Pleiades.\r\nAll tribes and nations of the world, from the remotest days of\r\nrecorded history up to the present time, have sung the praises of\r\nThe Pleiades. They were \"The Many Little Ones\" of the Babylonians,\r\n\"The Seven Sisters\" of the Greeks, \"The Seven Brothers\" of the\r\nAmerican Indians, \"The Hen and Chickens\" of many nations of Europe,\r\n\"The Little Eyes\" of the South Sea Islanders. They were honored in\r\nthe religious ceremonies of the Aztecs, and the savage tribes of\r\nAustralia danced in their honor. Many early tribes of men began their\r\nyear with November, the Pleiad month; and on November 17th, when\r\nThe Pleiades crossed the meridian at midnight, it was said that no\r\npetition was ever presented in vain to the kings of ancient Persia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JANUARY--TAURUS]\r\n\r\nPoets of all ages have felt the charm of The Pleiades. Tennyson gives\r\nthe following beautiful description of The Pleiades in _Locksley\r\nHall_:\r\n\r\n    \"Many a night I saw the Pleiades, rising through the mellow shade,\r\n    Glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid.\"\r\n\r\nA well-known astronomer, not so many years ago, also felt the\r\nmysterious charm of The Pleiades and seriously expressed the belief\r\nthat Alcyone, the brightest star of The Pleiades, was a central sun\r\nabout which all other suns were moving. But we know that there is no\r\nfoundation whatever for such a belief.\r\n\r\nA fairly good eye, when the night is clear and dark, will make out\r\nsix stars in this group arranged in the form of a small dipper. A\r\nseventh star lies close to the star at the end of the handle and is\r\nmore difficult to find. It is called Pleione, and is referred to in\r\nmany legends as the lost Pleiad. Persons gifted with exceptionally\r\nfine eyesight have made out as many as eleven stars in the group;\r\nand with the aid of an ordinary opera-glass, anyone can see fully\r\none hundred stars in this cluster. Astronomers have found that The\r\nPleiades cluster contains at least two hundred and fifty stars, all\r\ndrifting slowly in the same general direction through space, and that\r\nthe entire group is enveloped in a fiery, nebulous mist which is\r\nmost dense around the brightest stars. It is not known whether the\r\nstars are being formed from the nebula or whether the nebula is being\r\npuffed off from the stars. The brightest star, Alcyone, is at least\r\ntwo hundred times more brilliant than our own sun, and all of the\r\nbrighter stars in the group surpass the sun many times in brightness.\r\nIt is believed that this cluster is so large that light takes many\r\nyears to cross from one end of it to the other, and that it is so far\r\nfrom the earth that its light takes over three centuries to reach\r\nus, traveling at the rate of 186,000 miles a second.\r\n\r\nThe Hyades is a group of stars scarcely less famous than The\r\nPleiades, and the stars in the group also form a moving cluster of\r\nenormous extent at a distance of 140 light-years from the earth.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, The Hyades were called the rain-stars, and the\r\nword Hyades is supposed to come from the Greek word for rain. Among\r\nthe many superstitions of the past was the belief that the rising or\r\nsetting of a group of stars with the sun had some special influence\r\nover human affairs. Since The Hyades set just after the sun in the\r\nshowery springtime and just before sunrise in the stormy days of late\r\nfall, they were always associated with rain. In Tennyson's _Ulysses_\r\nwe read:\r\n\r\n    \"Through scudding drifts the rainy Hyades\r\n    Vex'd the dim sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hyades outline the forehead of Taurus, while two bright stars\r\nsome distance to the northeast of the V form the tips of the\r\nhorns. Only the head and forequarters of the bull are shown in the\r\nstar-atlases that give the mythological groups, for, according to one\r\nlegend, he is swimming through the sea and the rest of his body is\r\nsubmerged. According to another legend, Taurus is charging down upon\r\nOrion, The Warrior, represented by the magnificent constellation just\r\nto the southeast of Taurus, of which we shall have more to say next\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAldebaran is the Arabic word for \"The Hindmost,\" and the star is so\r\ncalled because it follows The Pleiades across the sky. It is one of\r\nthe most beautiful of all the many brilliant stars visible at this\r\ntime and we might profit by following the advice of Mrs. Sigourney in\r\n_The Stars_:\r\n\r\n                          \"Go forth at night\r\n    And talk with Aldebaran, where he flames\r\n    In the cold forehead of the wintry sky.\"\r\n\r\nNext to Aldebaran in the V is the interesting double star Theta,\r\nwhich we can see as two distinct stars without a telescope.\r\n\r\nDirectly south of Taurus is Eridanus, sometimes called Fluvius\r\nEridanus, or The River Eridanus. Starting a little to the southeast\r\nof Taurus, close to the brilliant blue-white star Rigel in Orion, it\r\nruns to the westward for a considerable distance in a long curving\r\nline of rather faint stars, bends sharply southward for a short\r\ndistance, then curves backward toward the east once more, and, after\r\nrunning for some distance, makes another sharp curve to the southwest\r\nand disappears below the southern horizon. Its course is continued\r\nfar into the southern hemisphere. Its brightest star, Achernar, is\r\na star of the first magnitude, but it lies below the horizon in our\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JANUARY--ERIDANUS]\r\n\r\nEridanus contains no star of particular interest to us. Most of the\r\nnumerous stars that mark its course are of the fourth and fifth\r\nmagnitude. It contains but two stars of the third magnitude, one\r\nat the beginning of its course and one close to the southwestern\r\nhorizon. The beautiful constellation of Perseus lies just to the\r\nnorth of Taurus and should rightfully be considered among the\r\nconstellations lying nearest to the meridian in January, but we give\r\nthis constellation among the star groups for December because of\r\nits close association with the nearby constellations Andromeda and\r\nPegasus in legend and story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAcross the meridian, due south, between eight and nine o'clock in\r\nthe evening in the early part of February, lies Orion, The Warrior,\r\ngenerally considered to be the finest constellation in the heavens.\r\nOrion is directly overhead at the equator, and so is seen to\r\nadvantage from all parts of the world except the extreme northern and\r\nsouthern polar regions.\r\n\r\nA group of three faint stars outlines the head of Orion. His right\r\nshoulder is marked by the deep-red, first-magnitude star Betelgeuze\r\n(meaning armpit), and his left shoulder by the bright white star\r\nBellatrix, The Amazon. Orion stands facing Taurus, The Bull, and\r\nbrandishes in his right hand a club, outlined by a number of faint\r\nstars extending from Betelgeuze toward the northeast. The top of the\r\nclub lies near the tips of the horns of Taurus. In his left hand he\r\nholds up a lion's skin, which we can trace in another curving line of\r\nfaint stars to the west and northwest of Bellatrix. The brilliant,\r\nblue-white, first-magnitude star Rigel lies in the left foot, and the\r\nsecond-magnitude star Saiph, a little to the east of Rigel, is in\r\nthe right knee. Three evenly spaced stars lying in a straight line\r\nthat is exactly three degrees in length form the Belt of Orion,\r\nand from the Belt hangs the Sword of Orion, outlined by three faint\r\nstars. The central star in the Sword appears somewhat blurred and is\r\nthe multiple star Theta, in the midst of the great Orion nebula, the\r\nfinest object of its kind in the heavens. Entangled in the meshes of\r\nthis glowing nebula are a number of brilliant suns, appearing to us\r\nas faint stars because of their great distance. The star Theta, in\r\nthe heart of the nebula, is seen with a powerful telescope to consist\r\nof six stars; that is, it is a sextuple star. Even with a small\r\ntelescope, four of these stars can readily be seen, arranged in the\r\nform of a small trapezium. The lowest star in the Sword is a triple\r\nstar, and the entire constellation abounds in double, triple, and\r\nmultiple stars.\r\n\r\nFrom the central portion of the nebula extend many branches and\r\nstreamers of nebulous light, and it is known that the entire\r\nconstellation of Orion is enwrapped in the folds of this nebulosity,\r\nwhich forms a glowing, whirling mass of fiery gases in rapid\r\nrotation. This constellation is remarkable for the fact that all of\r\nits brighter stars, with the exception of the deep-red Betelgeuze,\r\nform one enormous, connected group of stars. They are all more or\r\nless associated with the great nebula and its branches, and are all\r\nextremely hot, white or bluish-white stars, known as helium stars,\r\nbecause the gas helium is so conspicuous in their atmospheres. The\r\nOrion stars are the hottest and brightest of all the stars.\r\n\r\nBlazing Rigel, Bellatrix, and Saiph, marking three corners of the\r\ngreat quadrilateral, of which Betelgeuze marks the fourth corner, are\r\nall brilliant helium stars. So are the three stars in the Belt and\r\nthe fainter stars in the Sword and the great nebula.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FEBRUARY--ORION]\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that the great Orion group of stars is over\r\nsix hundred light-years from the earth, or about forty million times\r\nmore distant than the sun. For more than six centuries the rays of\r\nlight that now enter our eyes from these stars have been traveling\r\nthrough space with the speed of lightning. So we see Orion not as it\r\nexists today, but as it was six centuries ago. The extent of the\r\nOrion group of stars is also inconceivably great. Even the central\r\npart of the great nebula, which appears to our unaided eyes only as a\r\nsomewhat fuzzy star, would extend from here to the nearest star and\r\nbeyond, while our entire solar system would be the merest speck in\r\nits midst.\r\n\r\nBetelgeuze, the red star that marks the right shoulder of Orion,\r\nis, as we have said, not a member of the Orion group. It has been\r\nestimated that it is about two hundred light-years from the earth,\r\nor only about one-third as far away as the other stars of the\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\nBetelgeuze very recently has attracted universal attention, and will\r\nprobably be considered an object of historic interest in the future,\r\nbecause it is the first star to have its diameter measured with the\r\nnew Michelson interferometer, which is now being used so successfully\r\nto measure the diameters of the largest stars. The truly sensational\r\ndiscovery has been made that Betelgeuze is a supergiant of the\r\nuniverse, with a diameter of about 275,000,000 miles. Our own sun,\r\nwhich is known as a \"dwarf\" star, has a diameter of 864,000 miles.\r\nThat is, Betelgeuze would make about thirty million suns the size of\r\nour own. If placed at the center of the solar system, it would fill\r\nall of the space within the orbit of Mars; and the planets Mercury,\r\nVenus, and the Earth would lie far beneath its surface. Measurements\r\nof the diameters of other giant stars which are now being made with\r\nthe interferometer give results quite as startling as have been\r\nobtained in the case of Betelgeuze; and it has been found that\r\nseveral of these stars may even exceed Betelgeuze in size. Such a\r\nstar is Antares, the fiery-red star in the heart of Scorpio, which\r\nis such a conspicuous object in the summer evening skies. All these\r\nhuge stars are deep red in color, and some of them vary irregularly\r\nin brightness. Betelgeuze is one of the stars that changes in\r\nbrightness in a peculiar manner from time to time. When shining with\r\nits greatest brilliancy it is a brighter object than the nearby star\r\nAldebaran, in Taurus; but a few months or a year later it may lose\r\nso much of its light as to be decidedly inferior to Aldebaran. We\r\nmay note for ourselves this remarkable change in the brightness of\r\nBetelgeuze by comparing the two stars from time to time.\r\n\r\nDirectly south of Orion lies the small constellation of Lepus, The\r\nHare, which is made up of third-magnitude and fourth-magnitude stars.\r\nThe four brighter stars are arranged in the form of a small, but\r\ndistinct, quadrilateral, or four-sided figure, which may be easily\r\nseen in our latitudes. The small constellation of Columba, The Dove,\r\nwhich lies just south of Lepus, is so close to the horizon that it\r\ncan not be seen to advantage in the mid-latitudes of the northern\r\nhemisphere. Neither Lepus nor Columba contain any object of unusual\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FEBRUARY--AURIGA]\r\n\r\nDue north of Orion, and lying in the zenith at this time, is Auriga,\r\nThe Charioteer, represented, strange to say, with Capella, a goat, in\r\nhis arms. The beautiful first-magnitude star Capella, golden-yellow\r\nin color, serves us in identifying the constellation. Close at hand\r\nare The Kids, represented by a group of three faint stars. Capella\r\nis one of the most brilliant stars of the northern hemisphere. It\r\nis almost exactly equal in brightness to Arcturus and Vega, stars\r\nconspicuous in the summer months, and it is a shade brighter than\r\nmagnificent blue-white Rigel in Orion. Capella is about fifty\r\nlight-years distant from the earth and is fully two hundred times\r\nmore brilliant than our own sun. At the distance of Capella, the sun\r\nwould appear to be considerably fainter than any one of the three\r\nstars in the nearby group of The Kids.\r\n\r\nCapella is attended by a companion star so close to its brilliant\r\nruler that it can not be seen as a separate star save with the aid of\r\nthe most powerful telescopes. Its distance from Capella has been very\r\naccurately measured, however, by means of the interferometer, which\r\nis giving us the measurements of the diameters of the giant stars. It\r\nis known that this companion sun is closer to Capella than our planet\r\nearth is to the sun.\r\n\r\nAt no time of the year shall we find near the meridian so many\r\nbrilliant and beautiful stars as appear in the month of February at\r\nthis time in the evening. In addition to Capella, which is one of\r\nthe three most brilliant stars in the northern hemisphere of the\r\nheavens, we have, in Orion alone, two stars of the first magnitude,\r\nBetelgeuze and Rigel, and five stars of the second magnitude,\r\nBellatrix and Saiph and the three stars in the Belt. In addition, we\r\nhave not far distant in the western sky, fiery Aldebaran in Taurus,\r\nand close on the heel of Orion in the east, Sirius, the brightest\r\nstar in the heavens, in the constellation of Canis Major, The Greater\r\nDog, as well as the first-magnitude star Procyon in Canis Minor, The\r\nLesser Dog. Of these two groups we shall have more to say under the\r\nconstellations for March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMARCH\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the southeast of Orion and almost due south at eight o'clock in\r\nthe evening on the first of March lies the constellation of Canis\r\nMajor, The Greater Dog, containing Sirius, the Dog-star, which far\r\nsurpasses all other stars in the heavens in brilliancy.\r\n\r\nSirius lies almost in line with the three stars that form the Belt\r\nof Orion. We shall not have the slightest difficulty in recognizing\r\nit, owing to its surpassing brilliancy as well as to the fact that it\r\nfollows so closely upon the heels of Orion.\r\n\r\nSirius is the Greek for \"scorching\" or \"sparkling,\" and the ancients\r\nattributed the scorching heat of summer to the fact that Sirius\r\nthen rose with the sun. The torrid days of midsummer they called\r\nthe \"dog-days\" for this reason, and we have retained the expression\r\nto the present time. Since Sirius was always associated with the\r\ndiscomforts of the torrid season, it did not have an enviable\r\nreputation among the Greeks. We find in Pope's translation of the\r\n_Iliad_ this reference to Sirius:\r\n\r\n    \"Terrific glory! for his burning breath\r\n    Taints the red air with fever, plagues, and death.\"\r\n\r\nIn Egypt, however, many temples were dedicated to the worship of\r\nSirius, for the reason that some five thousand years ago it rose\r\nwith the sun at the time of the summer solstice, which marks the\r\nbeginning of summer, and heralded the approaching inundation of the\r\nNile, which was an occasion for great rejoicing among the Egyptians.\r\nIt was, therefore, called the Nile Star and regarded by them with the\r\ngreatest reverence.\r\n\r\nSirius is an intensely white hydrogen star; but owing to its great\r\nbrilliancy and to the fact that it does not attain a great height\r\nabove the horizon in our latitudes, its rays are greatly refracted\r\nor broken up by the atmosphere, which is most dense near the horizon,\r\nand as a result, it twinkles or scintillates more noticeably than\r\nother stars and flashes the spectrum colors--chiefly red and\r\ngreen--like a true \"diamond in the sky\"--a magnificent object in the\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nSirius is one of our nearest neighbors among the stars. Only two\r\nstars are known to be nearer to the solar system. Yet its light takes\r\nabout eight and a half years to flash with lightning speed across the\r\ngreat intervening chasm. It is attended also by a very faint star\r\nthat is so lost in the rays of its brilliant companion that it can\r\nonly be found with the aid of a powerful telescope. The two stars\r\nare separated by a distance of 1,800,000,000 miles; that is they are\r\nabout as far apart as Neptune and the sun. They swing slowly and\r\nmajestically about a common center, called their center of gravity,\r\nin a period of about forty-nine years. So faint is the companion of\r\nSirius that it is estimated that twenty thousand such stars would be\r\nneeded to give forth as much light as Sirius. The two stars together,\r\nSirius and its companion, give forth twenty-six times as much light\r\nas our own sun. They weigh only about three times as much, however.\r\nThe companion of Sirius, in spite of its extreme faintness, weighs\r\nfully half as much as the brilliant star.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARCH--CANIS MAJOR]\r\n\r\nThere are a number of bright stars in the constellation of Canis\r\nMajor. A fairly bright star a little to the west of Sirius marks the\r\nuplifted paw of the dog, and to the southeast, in the tail and hind\r\nquarters, are several conspicuous stars of the second magnitude.\r\n\r\nA little to the east and much farther to the north, we find Canis\r\nMinor, The Lesser Dog, containing the beautiful first-magnitude\r\nstar Procyon, \"Precursor of the Dog\"--that is, of Sirius. Since\r\nProcyon is so much farther north than Sirius and very little to the\r\neast, we see its brilliant rays in the eastern sky some time before\r\nSirius appears above the southeastern horizon, hence its name. Long\r\nafter Sirius has disappeared from view beneath the western horizon\r\nin the late spring, Procyon may still be seen low in the western\r\nsky. Procyon, also is one of our nearer neighbors among the stars,\r\nbeing only about ten light-years distant from the solar system. Like\r\nSirius, it is a double star with a much fainter companion, that by\r\nits attraction sways the motion of Procyon to such an extent that\r\nwe should know of its existence, even if it were not visible, by\r\nthe disturbances it produces in the motion of Procyon. The period\r\nof revolution of Procyon and its companion about a common center is\r\nabout forty years, and the two stars combined weigh about a third\r\nmore than our own sun and give forth six times as much light. Canis\r\nMinor contains only one other bright star, Beta, a short distance to\r\nthe northwest of Procyon. Originally, the name Procyon was given to\r\nthe entire constellation, but it was later used only with reference\r\nto the one star. Procyon, Sirius, and Betelgeuze in Orion form a huge\r\nequal-sided triangle that lies across the meridian at this time and\r\nis a most conspicuous configuration in the evening sky.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MARCH--GEMINI AND CANIS MINOR]\r\n\r\nDirectly south of the zenith we find Gemini, The Twins, one of the\r\nzodiacal constellations. It is in Gemini that the sun is to be found\r\nat the beginning of summer. The two bright stars Castor and Pollux\r\nmark the heads of the twins, and the two stars in the opposite\r\ncorners of the four-sided figure shown in the chart mark their feet.\r\n\r\nCastor and Pollux, according to the legend, were the twin brothers of\r\nHelen of Troy who went on the Argonautic expedition. When a storm\r\novertook the vessel on its return voyage, Orpheus invoked the aid of\r\nApollo, who caused two stars to shine above the heads of the twins,\r\nand the storm immediately ceased. It was for this reason that Castor\r\nand Pollux became the special deities of seamen, and it was customary\r\nto place their effigies upon the prows of vessels. The \"By Jimini!\"\r\nof today is but a corruption of the \"By Gemini!\" heard so frequently\r\namong the sailors of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical name for Castor, the fainter star, is Alpha\r\nGeminorum, meaning Alpha of Gemini. As it was customary to call the\r\nbrightest star in a constellation by the first letter in the Greek\r\nalphabet, it is believed that Castor has decreased considerably in\r\nbrightness since the days of the ancients, for it is now decidedly\r\ninferior to Pollux in brightness, which is called Beta Geminorum.\r\nOf the two stars, Castor is the more interesting because it is a\r\ndouble star that is readily separated into two stars with the aid of\r\na small telescope. The two principal stars are known to be, in turn,\r\nextremely close double stars revolving almost in contact in periods\r\nof a few days. Where we see but one star with the unaided eye, there\r\nis, then a system of four suns, the two close pairs revolving slowly\r\nabout a common center of gravity in a period of several centuries and\r\nat a great distance apart.\r\n\r\nThe star Pollux, which we can easily distinguish by its superior\r\nbrightness, is the more southerly of the twin stars and lies due\r\nnorth of Procyon and about as far from Procyon as Procyon is from\r\nSirius.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Gemini on the meridian in the early evening and\r\nof the huge triangle, with its corners marked by the brilliants,\r\nProcyon, Sirius, and Betelgeuze, due south, with \"Great Orion sloping\r\nslowly to the west,\" is as truly a sign of approaching spring as\r\nthe gradual lengthening of the days, the appearance of crocuses and\r\ndaffodils, and the first robin. It is only a few weeks later--as\r\npictured by Tennyson in _Maud_--\r\n\r\n    \"When the face of the night is fair on the dewy downs,\r\n    And the shining daffodil dies, and the Charioteer\r\n    And starry Gemini hang like glorious crowns\r\n    Over Orion's grave low down in the west.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nAPRIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early evening hours of April the western sky is still adorned\r\nwith the brilliant jewels with which we became familiar on the\r\nclear frosty evenings of winter. Orion is now sinking fast to his\r\nrest beneath the western horizon. Beautiful, golden Capella in\r\nAuriga glows in the northwest. Sirius sparkles and scintillates, a\r\nmagnificent diamond of the sky, just above the southwestern horizon,\r\nwhile Procyon in Canis Minor, The Lesser Dog, and Castor and Pollux,\r\nThe Twins, in the constellation of Gemini, are still high in the\r\nwestern part of the heavens.\r\n\r\nIn the northeast and east may be seen the constellations that will\r\nbe close to the meridian at this time next month. Ursa Major, The\r\nGreater Bear, with its familiar Big Dipper, is now in a favorable\r\nposition for observation. The Sickle in Leo is high in the eastern\r\nsky, and Spica, the brilliant white diamond of the evening skies of\r\nspring, is low in the southeast in Virgo.\r\n\r\nNear the meridian this month we find between Auriga and Ursa Major,\r\nand east of Gemini, the inconspicuous constellation of Lynx, which\r\ncontains not a single bright star and is a modern constellation\r\ndevised simply to fill the otherwise vacant space in circumpolar\r\nregions between Ursa Major and Auriga.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: APRIL--CANCER]\r\n\r\nJust south of the zenith at this time, and lying between Gemini and\r\nLeo, is Cancer, The Crab, the most inconspicuous of all the zodiacal\r\nconstellations. There are no bright stars in this group, and there\r\nis also nothing distinctive about the grouping of its faint stars,\r\nthough we can readily find it, from its position between the two\r\nneighboring constellations of Gemini and Leo by reference to the\r\nchart.\r\n\r\nIn the position indicated there we will see on clear evenings a\r\nfaint, nebulous cloud of light, which is known as Praesepe, The\r\nBeehive, or as The Manger, the two faint stars flanking it on either\r\nside being called Aselli, The Asses. This faint cloud can be easily\r\nresolved by an opera-glass into a coarse cluster of stars that lie\r\njust beyond the range of the unaided human vision.\r\n\r\nTo the ancients, Praesepe served as an indicator of weather\r\nconditions, and Aratus, an ancient astronomer, wrote of this cluster:\r\n\r\n    \"A murky manger, with both stars\r\n    Shining unaltered, is a sign of rain.\r\n    If while the northern ass is dimmed\r\n    By vaporous shroud, he of the south gleam radiant,\r\n    Expect a south wind; the vaporous shroud and radiance\r\n    Exchanging stars, harbinger Boreas.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not entirely a matter of superstition, as we might possibly\r\nimagine, for the dimness of the cluster is simply an indication\r\nthat vapor is gathering and condensing in the atmosphere, just as\r\na ring around the moon is an indication of the same gathering and\r\ncondensation of vapor that precedes a storm.\r\n\r\nSome centuries ago the sun reached its greatest distance north of the\r\nequator--which occurs each year at the beginning of summer--at the\r\ntime when it was passing through the constellation of Cancer. Our\r\ntropic of Cancer, which marks the northern limit of the torrid zone,\r\nreceived its name from this fact. At the time when the sun reaches\r\nthe point farthest north, its height above the horizon changes very\r\nlittle from day to day, and for a short time it appears to be slowly\r\ncrawling sideways through the heavens, as a crab walks, and for this\r\nreason, possibly, the constellation was called Cancer, The Crab.\r\nAt the present time the \"Precession of the Equinoxes,\" or westward\r\nshifting of the vernal equinox--the point where the sun crosses\r\nthe equator going north in the spring--brings the sun, when it is\r\nfarthest north, in Gemini instead of in Cancer. At the present time,\r\nthen it would be more accurate to speak of the tropic of Gemini,\r\nthough this in turn would be inaccurate after a lapse of centuries,\r\nas the sun passed into another constellation at the beginning of\r\nsummer. The tropic of Capricorn, which marks the farthest southern\r\nexcursions of the sun in its yearly circuit of the heavens, should\r\nalso more appropriately be called the tropic of Sagittarius, as the\r\nsun is now in Sagittarius instead of Capricornus at the time when it\r\nis farthest south, though the point is slowly shifting westward into\r\nScorpio.\r\n\r\nMythology tells us that Cancer was sent by Juno to distract Hercules\r\nby pinching his toes while he was contending with the many-headed\r\nserpent in the Lernean swamp. Hercules, the legend says, crushed the\r\ncrab with a single blow, and Juno by way of reward placed it in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nIn Cancer, according to the belief of the Chaldeans, was located the\r\n\"gate of men,\" by which souls descended into human bodies, while in\r\nCapricornus was the \"gate of the gods,\" through which the freed souls\r\nof men returned to heaven.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: APRIL--HYDRA]\r\n\r\nHydra, the many-headed serpent with which Hercules contended, is\r\nrepresented by a constellation of great length. It extends from a\r\npoint just south of Cancer, where a group of faint stars marks the\r\nheads, to the south and southeast in a long line of faint stars.\r\nIt passes in its course just south of Crater and Corvus, the two\r\nsmall star-groups below Leo (see constellations for May), which\r\nare sometimes called its riders, and it also stretches below the\r\nentire length of the long, straggling constellation of Virgo. At\r\nthis time we can trace it only to the point where it disappears\r\nbelow the horizon in the southeast. It contains but one bright star,\r\nAlphard, or Cor Hydrae as it is also called, standing quite alone and\r\nalmost due south at this time. Hydra, as well as Lynx and Cancer,\r\ncontains no noteworthy or remarkable object and consists chiefly of\r\nfaint stars. Alphard is, in fact, the only bright star that we have\r\nin the constellations for this month. It chances that these three\r\ninconspicuous star-groups, Lynx, Crater, and Hydra, lie nearest to\r\nthe meridian at this time, separating the brilliant groups of winter\r\nfrom those of the summer months.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: APRIL--LYNX]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nMAY\r\n\r\n\r\nUrsa Major, the Great Bear, and Ursa Minor, the Lesser Bear, or,\r\nas they are more familiarly called, the Big Dipper and the Little\r\nDipper, are the best known of all the constellations visible in\r\nnorthern latitudes. They are called circumpolar constellations, which\r\nmeans \"around the pole.\" For those who live north of 40° N. Lat. they\r\nnever set, but can be seen at all hours of the night and at all times\r\nof the year. In fall and winter evenings Ursa Major lies below the\r\npole and near the horizon, and so is usually hidden more or less from\r\nview by trees or buildings. It is during the early evening hours of\r\nlate spring and summer that this constellation is seen to the best\r\nadvantage high in the sky above the pole. If one looks due north at\r\nthe time mentioned, it will be impossible to miss either of these\r\nconstellations.\r\n\r\nTo complete the outline of the Great Bear, it is necessary to include\r\nfaint stars to the east, which form the head of the Bear, and other\r\nfaint stars to the south, which form the feet, but these are all\r\ninconspicuous and of little general interest.\r\n\r\nThe two stars in the bowl of the Big Dipper through which an arrow is\r\ndrawn in the chart, are called the Pointers, because an imaginary\r\nline drawn through these two stars and continued a distance about\r\nequal to the length of the Big Dipper, brings us to the star\r\nPolaris, or the North Star, at the end of the handle of the Little\r\nDipper, which is very close to the north pole of the heavens, the\r\ndirection in which the earth's axis points. The pole lies on the line\r\nconnecting the star at the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper with\r\nPolaris, and is only one degree distant from the pole-star.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAY--URSA MAJOR AND URSA MINOR]\r\n\r\nThe distance between the Pointers is five degrees of arc, and the\r\ndistance from the more northerly of these two stars to Polaris is\r\nnearly thirty degrees. We may find it useful to remember this in\r\nestimating distances between objects in the heavens, which are always\r\ngiven in angular measure.\r\n\r\nA small two and one-half inch telescope will separate Polaris into\r\ntwo stars eighteen seconds of arc apart. The companion star is a\r\nfaint white star of the ninth magnitude.\r\n\r\nTwenty years or so ago it was discovered with the aid of the\r\nspectroscope that the brighter of the two stars was also a double\r\nstar, but the two stars were so close together that they could not\r\nbe seen as separate stars in any telescope. Later it was found that\r\nthe brighter star was in reality triple, that is, it consists of\r\nthree suns close together. The faint white companion star formed\r\nwith these three suns a system of four suns revolving about a common\r\ncenter of gravity. Still more recently it has been discovered that\r\nthe brightest of these four suns varies regularly in brightness in a\r\nperiod of a little less than four days. It belongs to the important\r\nclass of stars known as Cepheid variable stars, whose changes\r\nof light, it is believed, are produced by some periodic form of\r\ndisturbance taking place within the stars themselves.\r\n\r\nWith one exception, Polaris is the nearest to the earth of all these\r\nCepheid variable stars, which are in most instances at very great\r\ndistances from the solar system. The latest measurements of the\r\ndistance of Polaris show that its light takes about two centuries\r\nto travel to the earth, or, in other words, that it is distant two\r\nhundred light-years.\r\n\r\nLike all Cepheid variables, Polaris is a giant star. It gives forth\r\nabout five hundred and twenty-five times as much light as our own\r\nsun. If Polaris and the sun were placed side by side at a distance of\r\nthirty-three light-years, the sun would appear as a star of the fifth\r\nmagnitude, just well within the range of visibility of the human\r\neye, while Polaris would outshine Sirius, the brightest star in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nAs a practical aid to navigators, Polaris is unsurpassed in\r\nimportance by any star of the northern hemisphere of the heavens. At\r\nthe equator the pole-star lies in the horizon; at the north pole of\r\nthe earth it is in the zenith or directly overhead. Its altitude or\r\nheight above the horizon is always equal to the latitude of the place\r\nof observation. As we travel northward from the equator toward the\r\npole we see Polaris rise higher and higher in the sky. In New York\r\nthe elevation of Polaris above the horizon is forty degrees, which is\r\nthe latitude of the city.\r\n\r\nThe Pointers indicate the direction of Polaris and the true north,\r\nwhile the height of Polaris above the horizon tells us our latitude.\r\nThese kindly stars direct us by night when we are uncertain of our\r\nbearings, whether we travel by land or sea or air. They are the\r\nfriends and aids of explorers, navigators and aviators, who often\r\nturn to them for guidance.\r\n\r\nBryant writes thus beautifully of Polaris in his _Hymn to the North\r\nStar_:\r\n\r\n    Constellations come and climb the heavens, and go.\r\n    Star of the Pole! and thou dost see them set.\r\n            Alone in thy cold skies,\r\n    Thou keep'st thy old unmoving station yet,\r\n    Nor join'st the dances of that glittering train,\r\n    Nor dipp'st thy virgin orb in the blue western main.\r\n\r\n            On thy unaltering blaze\r\n    The half wrecked mariner, his compass lost,\r\n            Fixes his steady gaze,\r\n    And steers, undoubting, to the friendly coast;\r\n    And they who stray in perilous wastes by night,\r\n    Are glad when thou dost shine to guide their footsteps right.\r\n\r\nThe star at the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper, called Mizar,\r\nis of special interest. If one has good eyesight, he will see close\r\nto it a faint star. This is Alcor, which is Arabic for The Test. The\r\ntwo stars are also called the Horse and the Rider.\r\n\r\nMizar forms with Alcor what is known as a wide double star. It is, in\r\nfact, the widest of all double stars. Many stars in the heavens that\r\nappear single to us are separated by the telescope into double or\r\ntriple or multiple stars. They consist of two or more suns revolving\r\nabout a common center, known as their center of gravity. Sometimes\r\nthe suns are so close together that even the most powerful telescope\r\nwill not separate them. Then a most wonderful little instrument,\r\ncalled the spectroscope, steps in and analyzes the light of the stars\r\nand shows which are double and which are single. A star shown to be\r\ndouble by the spectroscope, but not by the telescope, is called a\r\nspectroscopic binary star.\r\n\r\nMizar is of historic interest, as being the first double star to\r\nbe detected with the aid of the telescope. A very small telescope\r\nwill split Mizar up into two stars. The brighter of the two is a\r\nspectroscopic binary star beside, so that it really consists of two\r\nsuns instead of one, with the distance between the two so small that\r\neven the telescope cannot separate them. About this system of three\r\nsuns which we know as the star Mizar, the faint star Alcor revolves\r\nat a distance equal to sixteen thousand times the distance of the\r\nearth from the sun.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAY--LEO]\r\n\r\nIf we follow the imaginary line drawn through the Pointers in a\r\n_southerly_ direction about forty-five degrees, we come to Leo,\r\nThe Lion, one of the zodiacal constellations. There should be\r\nno difficulty in finding the constellation Leo, as its peculiar\r\nsickle-shaped group of bright stars makes it distinctive from all\r\nother constellations. At the time we have mentioned, that is, the\r\nearly evening hours, it will lie a little to the southwest of the\r\nzenith. Leo is one of the finest constellations and is always\r\nassociated with the spring months because it is then high in the sky\r\nin the evening. Regulus is the beautiful white star which marks\r\nthe handle of The Sickle, and the heart of Leo; and Denebola is the\r\nsecond-magnitude star in the tail of Leo.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MAY--CORVUS AND CRATER]\r\n\r\nDue south of Denebola, about thirty degrees, we find the small\r\nstar-group known as Crater, The Cup, which is composed of rather\r\nfaint and inconspicuous stars. Just east of Crater is the group\r\nknown as Corvus, The Crow, which forms a very characteristic little\r\nfour-sided figure of stars differing very little from one another\r\nin brightness. These two star groups lie far to the south in our\r\nlatitudes; but if we lived twenty degrees south of the equator, we\r\nwould find them nearly overhead, at this time of the year. Just south\r\nof Corvus and Crater we find Hydra, one of the constellations for\r\nApril which extends beneath these constellations and also beneath\r\nVirgo, one of the June constellations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nJUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe star-groups that occupy the center of the celestial stage in\r\nmid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere during the early evening\r\nhours of June are Boötes, often called The Hunter, (although the word\r\nmeans Herdsman or Shouter), which will be found overhead at this\r\ntime; Virgo, The Maiden, largest of the zodiacal constellations,\r\nlying nearly due south; Canes Venatici, The Hunting Dogs; Corona\r\nBorealis, The Northern Crown, and Coma Berenices.\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous orange-hued Arcturus in Boötes and the beautiful\r\nbluish-white Spica in Virgo, like a diamond in its sparkling\r\nradiance, form with Denebola in Leo, which we identified in May, a\r\nhuge equal-sided triangle that is always associated with the spring\r\nand early summer months.\r\n\r\nTo the west of Boötes, below the handle of the Big Dipper, is a\r\nregion where there are few conspicuous stars. Here will be found\r\nCanes Venatici (The Hunting Dogs with which Boötes is supposed to be\r\npursuing the Great Bear around the north pole), and, further south,\r\nComa Berenices (Bernice's Hair).\r\n\r\nThe brighter of the two Hunting Dogs, which is also the brightest\r\nstar in the entire region covered by these two constellations,\r\nappears as a beautiful blue-and-yellow double star in the telescope.\r\nIt was named Cor Caroli (Heart of Charles) by the astronomer Halley\r\nin honor of Charles II of England, at the suggestion of the court\r\nphysician, who imagined it shone more brightly than usual the\r\nnight before the return of Charles to London. Of more interest to\r\nastronomers is the magnificent spiral nebula in this constellation,\r\nknown as the \"Whirlpool Nebula,\" appearing as a faint, luminous patch\r\nin the sky, of which many photographs have been taken with the great\r\ntelescopes. This entire region, from Canes Venatici to Virgo, abounds\r\nin faint spiral nebulæ that for some reason not yet understood by\r\nastronomers are crowded together in this part of the heavens where\r\nstars are comparatively few. It is believed that there are between\r\nfive hundred thousand and a million of these spiral nebulæ in the\r\nentire heavens, and the problem of their nature and origin and\r\ndistance is one that the astronomers are very anxious to solve. Many\r\nwonderful facts are now being learned concerning these faint nebulous\r\nwisps of light which, with a few exceptions, are observable only with\r\ngreat telescopes. They reveal their spiral structure more clearly to\r\nthe photographic plate than to the human eye, and some magnificent\r\nphotographs of them have been taken with powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nComa Berenices, south of Canes Venatici and southwest of Boötes, is\r\na constellation that consists of a great number of stars closely\r\ncrowded together, and just barely visible to the unaided eye. As\r\na result, it has the appearance of filmy threads of light, which\r\ndoubtless suggested its name to the imaginative ancients, who loved\r\nto fill the heavens with fanciful creations associated with their\r\nmyths and legends. These stars form a moving cluster of stars\r\nestimated to be at a distance of about 270 light-years from the solar\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JUNE--BOÖTES, CANES VENATICI AND COMA BERENICIS]\r\n\r\nThis region, so lacking in interesting objects for the naked-eye\r\nobserver, is a mine of riches to the fortunate possessors of\r\ntelescopes; and the great telescopes of the world are frequently\r\npointed in this direction, exploring the mysteries of space that\r\nabound here.\r\n\r\nJust to the east of Boötes is the exquisite little circlet of stars\r\nknown as Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown. It consists of six\r\nstars arranged in a nearly perfect semicircle, and one will have no\r\ndifficulty in recognizing it. Its brightest star, Alpha, known also\r\nby the name of Alphacca, is a star of the second magnitude.\r\n\r\nBoötes is one of the largest and finest of the northern\r\nconstellations. It can be easily distinguished by its peculiar\r\nkite-shaped grouping of stars or by the conspicuous pentagon\r\n(five-sided figure) of stars which it contains. The most southerly\r\nstar in this pentagon is known as Epsilon Boötes and is one of\r\nthe finest double stars in the heavens. The two stars of which it\r\nconsists are respectively orange and greenish-blue in color.\r\n\r\nBy far the finest object in Boötes, however, is the magnificent\r\nArcturus, which is the brightest star in the northern hemisphere\r\nof the heavens. This star will be conspicuous in the evening hours\r\nthroughout the summer months, as will also the less brilliant Spica\r\nin Virgo.\r\n\r\nSome recent measurements show that Arcturus is one of our nearer\r\nneighbors among the stars. Its distance is now estimated to be about\r\ntwenty-one light-years. That is, a ray of light from this star takes\r\ntwenty-one years to reach the earth, traveling at the rate of one\r\nhundred and eighty-six thousand miles per second. It would seem as\r\nif we should hardly speak of Arcturus, twenty-one light-years away,\r\nas a near neighbor, yet there are millions of stars that are far\r\nmore distant from the earth, and very few that are nearer to us than\r\nArcturus.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of Arcturus is estimated to be about forty times that\r\nof the sun. That is, if the two bodies were side by side, Arcturus\r\nwould give forth forty times as much light and heat as the sun.\r\n\r\nArcturus is also one of the most rapidly moving stars in the heavens.\r\nIn the past sixteen centuries it has traveled so far as to have\r\nchanged its position among the other stars by as much as the apparent\r\nwidth of the moon. Most of the stars, in spite of their motions\r\nthrough the heavens in various directions, appear today in the same\r\nrelative positions in which they were several thousand years ago. It\r\nis for this reason that the constellations of the Egyptians and of\r\nthe Greeks and Romans are the same constellations that we see in the\r\nheavens today. Were all the stars as rapidly moving as Arcturus, the\r\ndistinctive forms of the constellations would be preserved for only a\r\nvery few centuries.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JUNE--VIRGO]\r\n\r\nVirgo, which lies south and southwest of Boötes, is a large,\r\nstraggling constellation, consisting of a Y-shaped configuration of\r\nrather inconspicuous stars. It lies in the path of our sun, moon and\r\nplanets, and so is one of the zodiacal constellations. The cross in\r\nthe diagram indicates the present position of the autumnal equinox,\r\nthe point where the sun crosses the equator going south, and the\r\nposition the sun now occupies at the beginning of fall.\r\n\r\nSpica, the brightest star in Virgo, is a bluish-white,\r\nfirst-magnitude star, standing very much alone in the sky. In fact,\r\nthe Arabs referred to this star as \"The Solitary One.\" Its distance\r\nfrom the earth is not known, but must be very great as it cannot be\r\nfound by the usual methods. The spectroscope shows that it consists\r\nof two suns very close together, revolving about a common center in a\r\nperiod of only four days.\r\n\r\nWithin the branches of the \"Y\" in Virgo, and just to the north of it,\r\nis the wonderful nebulous region of this constellation, but it takes\r\na powerful telescope to show the faint spiral nebulæ that exist here\r\nin great profusion. All of these spirals are receding from the plane\r\nof the Milky Way with enormous velocities. The spiral nebulæ are, in\r\nfact, the most rapidly moving objects in the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nJULY\r\n\r\n\r\nDue east of the little circlet of stars known as Corona Borealis, and\r\nalmost directly overhead in our latitude (40° N.) about nine o'clock\r\nin the evening in the early part of July, is the large constellation\r\nof Hercules, named for the famous hero of Grecian mythology. There\r\nare no stars of great brilliancy in this group, but it contains a\r\nlarge number of fairly bright stars arranged in the form outlined in\r\nthe chart. The hero is standing with his head, marked by the star\r\nAlpha Herculis, toward the south, and his foot resting on the head of\r\nDraco, The Dragon, a far-northern constellation with which we become\r\nacquainted in August.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JULY--HERCULES]\r\n\r\nAlpha Herculis, the best known star in this constellation, is of\r\nunusual interest. Not only is it a most beautiful double star, the\r\nbrighter of the two stars of which it is composed being orange, and\r\nthe fainter greenish-blue, but it is also a star that changes in\r\nbrightness irregularly. Both the orange and the blue star share in\r\nthis change of brightness. There are a number of stars in the heavens\r\nthat vary in brightness, some in very regular periods, and others,\r\nlike Alpha Herculis, irregularly. These latter stars are nearly\r\nalways deep orange or reddish in color. One may note this variation\r\nin the brightness of Alpha Herculis by comparing it from time to time\r\nwith some nearby star that does not vary in brightness.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE GREAT HERCULES CLUSTER--A UNIVERSE OF SUNS\r\n  Taken with 60-inch Reflector of the Mt. Wilson Observatory]\r\n\r\nThe constellation of Hercules is a very rich field for the possessor\r\nof even a small telescope. Here are to be found beautifully colored\r\ndouble stars in profusion, and, in addition, two remarkable clusters\r\nof stars. The brighter of the two is known as the Great Hercules\r\nCluster. Its position is shown on the chart, and, under favorable\r\nconditions--that is, on a clear, dark night, when there is no\r\nmoonlight--it may be seen without the aid of a telescope as a small,\r\nfaint patch of light. One would never suspect from such a view what\r\na wonderful object this cluster becomes when seen with the aid of a\r\npowerful telescope. Photographs taken with the great telescopes show\r\nthis faint wisp of light as a magnificent assemblage of thousands of\r\nstars, each a sun many times more brilliant than our own sun. The\r\ncrowded appearance of the stars in the cluster is due partly to the\r\nfact that it is very distant from the earth, though neighboring stars\r\nin the cluster are indeed much nearer to one another than are the\r\nstars in the vicinity of our solar system. It has been found that\r\nthis cluster is so far away that its light takes over thirty-six\r\nthousand years to reach the earth. At the distance of this cluster,\r\na sun equal in brightness to our own sun would be so faint that the\r\nmost powerful telescope in the world would not show it. So we know\r\nthat the stars that are visible in the Hercules cluster are far more\r\nbrilliant than our sun. A fair-sized telescope will show about four\r\nthousand stars in this cluster, but the greatest telescopes show over\r\none hundred thousand in it, and there are without doubt many more too\r\nfaint to be seen at all. The Hercules cluster is called a globular\r\nstar-cluster, because the stars in it are arranged nearly in the form\r\nof a sphere. There are in the heavens about ninety such clusters\r\nwhose distances have been found, and they are among the most distant\r\nof all objects. Most of them are very faint, and a few are over two\r\nhundred thousand light-years distant from the earth. The Hercules\r\ncluster is one of the nearest and is the most noted of all of these\r\nglobular clusters. It is considered to be one of the finest objects\r\nin the heavens. The other cluster in Hercules is also very fine, but\r\nnot to be compared with this one.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JULY--OPHIUCHUS AND SERPENS]\r\n\r\nJust to the south of Hercules are two constellations, Ophiuchus, The\r\nSerpent-Bearer, and Serpens, The Serpent, which are so intermingled\r\nthat it is difficult to distinguish them. There are in these two\r\nconstellations, as in Hercules, no stars of unusual brilliancy,\r\nbut a large number of fairly bright stars. The brightest star in\r\nOphiuchus is known as Alpha Ophiuchi and it marks the head of the\r\nSerpent-Bearer. The two stars, Alpha Ophiuchi and Alpha Herculis,\r\nare close together, being separated by a distance about equal to\r\nthat between the Pointers of the Big Dipper. Alpha Ophiuchi is the\r\nbrighter of the two, and it is farther east.\r\n\r\nOphiuchus, according to one legend, was once a physician on earth,\r\nand was so successful as a healer that he could raise the dead.\r\nPluto, the god of the lower world, became alarmed for fear his\r\nkingdom would become depopulated, and persuaded Jupiter to remove\r\nOphiuchus to a heavenly abode, where he would be less troublesome.\r\nThe serpent is supposed to be a symbol of his healing powers. The\r\nhead of Serpens is marked by a group of faint stars just south of\r\nCorona Borealis and southwest of Hercules. From here a line of fairly\r\nbright stars marks the course of Serpens southward to the hand of\r\nOphiuchus. Two stars close together and nearly equal in brightness\r\nmark the hand with which the hero grasps the body of the serpent. The\r\nother hand is marked by an equally bright single star some distance\r\nto the eastward where the two constellations again meet. Ophiuchus\r\nis thus represented as holding the serpent with both hands. It is\r\nnot an easy matter to make out the outlines of these straggling\r\ngroups, but there are in them several pairs of stars nearly equal in\r\nbrightness and about as evenly spaced as the two stars in the one\r\nhand of Ophiuchus, and these, as well as the diagram, will be of aid\r\nin tracing the two groups.\r\n\r\nJust south of Serpens and Ophiuchus lies one of the most beautiful\r\nand easily recognized constellations in the heavens. This is the\r\nconstellation of Scorpio, The Scorpion, which will be found not far\r\nabove the southern horizon at this time. The small constellation\r\nof Libra, The Scales, which lies just to the northwest of Scorpio,\r\nwas at one time a part of this constellation and represented the\r\ncreature's claws, but some centuries ago its name was changed to\r\nLibra. Both Scorpio and Libra are numbered among the twelve zodiacal\r\nconstellations--that is, they lie along the ecliptic, or apparent\r\nyearly path of the sun among the stars. Scorpio is the most brilliant\r\nand interesting of all the zodiacal groups. The heart of the Scorpion\r\nis marked by the magnificent first-magnitude star Antares, which is\r\nof a deep reddish color. The name signifies Rival of Ares (Mars).\r\nIt is so called because it is the one star in the heavens that most\r\nclosely resembles Mars, and it might be mistaken for the ruddy planet\r\nif one were not familiar with the constellations. At times, when Mars\r\nis at a considerable distance from the earth, it is almost equal\r\nin brightness and general appearance to this glowing red star in\r\nthe heart of the Scorpion. In its trips around the sun, Mars passes\r\noccasionally very close to Antares, and the two then present a very\r\nstriking appearance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JULY--LIBRA AND SCORPIO]\r\n\r\nWith a telescope of medium size, one will find an exquisite little\r\ngreen companion-star close to Antares. The little companion is so\r\nclose to Antares that it is difficult to find it in the glare of\r\nlight from its more brilliant neighbor. Antares is one of the giant\r\nstars of the universe. In fact it is, so far as we know, the greatest\r\nof all the giants. Its diameter is more than five hundred times that\r\nof our own sun and nearly twice that of the giant star Betelgeuze in\r\nOrion. If placed at the center of the solar system its surface would\r\nlie far beyond the orbit of Mars.\r\n\r\nBoth Ophiuchus and Scorpio are crossed by the Milky Way, that broad\r\nbelt of numberless faint stars that encircles the heavens. Some of\r\nthe most wonderful and beautiful regions of the Milky Way are to be\r\nfound in these two constellations.\r\n\r\nAt various times in the past, there have suddenly flashed forth\r\nbrilliant stars in the Milky Way which are known as \"temporary\r\nstars,\" or \"novæ.\" These outbursts signify that some celestial\r\ncatastrophe has taken place, the nature or cause of which is not\r\nclearly understood. Some of the most brilliant of these outbursts\r\nhave occurred in these two constellations. The life of a nova is very\r\nshort, a matter of a few months, and it rapidly sinks into oblivion,\r\nso nothing is to be seen of some of the most brilliant of all these\r\nstars that have appeared in this region in the past. A few are still\r\nfaintly visible in large telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nAUGUST\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one of the twelve labors of Hercules, the hero of Grecian\r\nmythology, to vanquish the dragon that guarded the golden apples in\r\nthe garden of the Hesperides. Among the constellations for July we\r\nfound the large group of stars that represents the hero himself,\r\nand this month we find just to the north of Hercules the head of\r\nDraco, The Dragon. The foot of the hero rests upon the dragon's head,\r\nwhich is outlined by a group of four fairly bright stars forming a\r\nquadrilateral or four-sided figure. The brightest star in this group\r\npasses in its daily circuit of the pole almost through the zenith\r\nof London. That is, as it crosses the meridian of London, it is\r\nalmost exactly overhead. From the head of Draco, the creature's body\r\ncan be traced in a long line of stars curving first eastward, then\r\nnorthward, toward the pole-star to a point above Hercules, where it\r\nbends sharply westward. The body of the monster lies chiefly between\r\nits head and the bowl of the Little Dipper. The tail extends in a\r\nlong line of faint stars midway between the two Dippers, or the\r\nconstellations of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the tip of the tail\r\nlying on the line connecting the Pointers of the Big Dipper with the\r\npole-star Polaris.\r\n\r\nDraco, as well as Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, is a circumpolar\r\nconstellation in our latitude; that is, it makes its circuit of the\r\npole without at any time dipping below the horizon in latitudes\r\nnorth of 40°. It is, therefore, visible at all hours of the night in\r\nmid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere, but is seen to the best\r\nadvantage during the early evening hours in the summer months. There\r\nare no remarkable stars in this constellation with the exception of\r\nAlpha, which lies halfway between the bowl of the Little Dipper and\r\nMizar, the star at the bend in the handle of the Big Dipper.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUGUST--DRACO AND LYRA]\r\n\r\nAbout four thousand seven hundred years ago, this star was the\r\npole-star--lying even nearer to what was then the north pole of the\r\nheavens than Polaris does to the present position of the pole. The\r\nsun and moon exert a pull on the bulging equatorial regions of the\r\nearth, which tends to draw the plane of the earth's equator down\r\ninto the plane of the ecliptic. This causes the \"Precession of the\r\nEquinoxes\" and at the same time a slow revolution of the earth's axis\r\nof rotation about the pole of the ecliptic. The north pole of the\r\nheavens as a result describes a circle about the pole of the ecliptic\r\nof radius 23-1/2° in a period of 25,800 years.\r\n\r\nEach bright star that lies near the circumference of this circle\r\nbecomes in turn the pole-star sometime within this period. The star\r\nAlpha, in Draco, had its turn at being pole-star some forty-seven\r\ncenturies ago. Polaris is now a little over a degree from the north\r\npole of the heavens. During the next two centuries it will continue\r\nto approach the pole until it comes within a quarter of a degree\r\nof it, when its distance from the pole will begin to increase\r\nagain. About twelve thousand years hence the magnificent Vega,\r\nwhose acquaintance we will now make, will be the most brilliant and\r\nbeautiful of all pole-stars.\r\n\r\nVega (Arabic for \"Falling Eagle\") is the resplendent, bluish-white,\r\nfirst-magnitude star that lies in the constellation of Lyra, The Lyre\r\nor Harp, a small, but important, constellation just east of Hercules\r\nand a little to the southeast of the head of Draco. Vega is almost\r\nexactly equal in brightness to Arcturus, the orange-colored star in\r\nBoötes, now lying west of the meridian in the early evening hours.\r\nIt is also a near neighbor of the solar system, its light taking\r\nsomething like forty years to travel to the earth. Vega is carried\r\nnearly through the zenith of Washington and all places in the same\r\nlatitude by the apparent daily rotation of the heavens. It is a star\r\nthat we have no difficulty in recognizing, owing to the presence of\r\ntwo nearby stars that form, with it, a small equal-sided triangle\r\nwith sides only two degrees in extent. If our own sun were at the\r\ndistance of Vega, it would not appear as bright as one of these faint\r\nstars, so much more brilliant is this magnificent sun than our own.\r\nThe two faint stars that follow so closely after Vega and form the\r\nlittle triangle with it are also of particular interest. Epsilon\r\nLyræ, which is the northern one of these two stars, may be used as a\r\ntest of keen eyesight. It is the finest example in the heavens of a\r\nquadruple star--that is, \"a double-double star.\" A keen eye can just\r\nseparate this star into two without a telescope, and with the aid of\r\na telescope, each of the two splits up into two stars, making four\r\nstars in place of the one visible to the average eye. Zeta, the other\r\nof the two stars that form the little triangle with Vega, is also a\r\nfine double star. The star that lies almost in a straight line with\r\nEpsilon and Zeta and a short distance to the south of them is a very\r\ninteresting variable star known as Beta Lyræ. Its brightness changes\r\nvery considerably in a period of twelve days and twenty-two hours.\r\nThis change of brightness is due to the presence of a companion\r\nstar. The two stars are in mutual revolution, and their motion is\r\nviewed at such an angle from the earth that, in each revolution, one\r\nstar is eclipsed by the other, producing a variation in the amount\r\nof light that reaches our eyes. By comparing this star from day to\r\nday with the star just a short distance to the southeast of it, which\r\ndoes not vary in brightness, we can observe for ourselves this change\r\nin the light of Beta Lyræ. There are a number of stars in the heavens\r\nthat vary in brightness in the same manner as Beta Lyræ, and they are\r\ncalled eclipsing-variable stars.\r\n\r\nOn the line connecting Beta Lyræ with the star southeast of it and\r\none-third of the distance from Beta to this star, lies the noted\r\nRing Nebula in Lyra, which is a beautiful object even in a small\r\ntelescope. It consists of a ring of luminous gas surrounding a\r\ncentral star. The star shines with a brilliant, bluish-white light\r\nand is visible only in powerful telescopes though it is easily\r\nphotographed since it gives forth rays to which the photographic\r\nplate is particularly sensitive. In small telescopes the central part\r\nof this nebula appears dark but with a powerful telescope a faint\r\nlight may be seen even in the central portion of the nebula. This is\r\none of the most interesting and beautiful telescopic objects in the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nIt is in the general direction of the constellation of Lyra that our\r\nsolar system is speeding at the rate of more than a million miles a\r\nday. This point toward which we are moving at such tremendous speed\r\nlies a little to the southwest of Vega, on the border between the\r\nconstellations of Lyra and Hercules, and is spoken of as The Apex of\r\nthe Sun's Way.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: AUGUST--SAGITTARIUS]\r\n\r\nIn the southern sky we have this month the constellation of\r\nSagittarius, The Archer, which is just to the east of Scorpio and\r\na considerable distance south of Lyra. It can be recognized by its\r\npeculiar form, which is that of a short-handled milk dipper, with\r\nthe bowl turned toward the south and a trail of bright stars running\r\nfrom the end of the handle toward the southwest. This is one of\r\nthe zodiacal groups which contain no first-magnitude stars, but a\r\nnumber of the second and third magnitude. It is crossed by the Milky\r\nWay, which is very wonderful in its structure at this point. Some\r\nastronomers believe that here--among the star-clouds and mists of\r\nnebulous light which are intermingled with dark lanes and holes, in\r\nreality dark nebulæ--lies the center of the vast system of stars and\r\nnebulæ in which our entire solar system is but the merest speck. Some\r\nof the grandest views through the telescope are also to be obtained\r\nin this beautiful constellation of Sagittarius, which is so far\r\nsouth that it is seen to better advantage in the tropics than in the\r\nmid-latitudes of the northern hemispheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful constellations of the northern hemisphere\r\nis Cygnus, The Swan, which is in the zenith in mid-latitudes about\r\nnine o'clock in the evening the middle of September. It lies directly\r\nin the path of the Milky Way which stretches diagonally across\r\nthe heavens from the northeast to the southwest at this time. In\r\nCygnus, the Milky Way divides into two branches, one passing through\r\nOphiuchus and Serpens to Scorpio, and the other through Sagitta and\r\nAquila to Sagittarius, to meet again in the southern constellation of\r\nAra, just south of Scorpio and Sagittarius. On clear, dark evenings,\r\nwhen there is no moonlight, this long, dark rift in the Milky Way\r\ncan be seen very clearly. In Cygnus, as in Ophiuchus, Scorpio, and\r\nSagittarius we find wonderful star-clouds, consisting of numberless\r\nstars so distant from us and, therefore, so faint that they do not\r\nappear as distinct points of light except in the greatest telescopes.\r\nIt is the combined light from these numberless stars that cannot\r\nbe seen separately that produces the impression of stars massed in\r\nclouds of nebulous light and gives to this girdle of the heavens\r\nits name of the Milky Way. In Cygnus, as in a number of other\r\nconstellations of both hemispheres, the Milky Way is crossed by dark\r\nrifts and bars and is very complicated in its structure. It is in\r\nCygnus, also, that one may see with the aid of powerful telescopes\r\nthe vast, irregular, luminous nebulæ, that are like great clouds of\r\nfiery mist. These nebulæ are of enormous extent, for they cover space\r\nthat could be occupied by hundreds of stars.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SEPTEMBER--CYGNUS]\r\n\r\nCygnus is a constellation that is filled with the wonders and\r\nmysteries of space and that abounds in beautiful objects of varied\r\nkinds. It is a region one never tires of exploring with the\r\ntelescope. The principal stars in Cygnus form the well-known Northern\r\nCross, with the beautiful, white, first-magnitude star Deneb, or\r\nArided, as it is sometimes called, at the top of the cross, and\r\nAlbireo, the orange-and-blue double star at the foot. Albireo,\r\namong all the pairs of contrasting hues, has the distinction of\r\nbeing considered the finest double star in the heavens for small\r\ntelescopes. This star marks the head of The Swan, as well as the foot\r\nof the Northern Cross, and Deneb marks the tail of The Swan. A short\r\ndistance to the southeast of Deneb, on the right wing of The Swan,\r\nis a famous little star, 61 Cygni, barely visible to the naked eye\r\nand forming a little triangle with two brighter stars to the east.\r\nThis star has the distinction of being the first one to have its\r\ndistance from the solar system determined. The famous mathematician\r\nand astronomer Bessel accomplished this difficult feat in the year\r\n1838. Since that day, the distances of many stars have been found\r\nby various methods, but of all these stars only four or five are\r\nknown to be nearer to us than 61 Cygni. Its distance is about eight\r\nlight-years, so its light takes about eight years to travel the\r\ndistance that separates it from the solar system. As a result, we see\r\nit not as it is tonight, but as it was at the time when the light\r\nnow entering our eyes first started on its journey eight years ago.\r\n61 Cygni is also a double star, and the combined light of the two\r\nstars gives forth only one-tenth as much light as our own sun. Most\r\nof the brilliant first-magnitude stars give forth many times as much\r\nlight as the sun; but among the fainter stars, we find some that\r\nappear faint because they are very distant, and some that are faint\r\nbecause they are dwarf stars and have little light to give forth. To\r\nthe class of nearby, feebly-shining dwarf stars 61 Cygni belongs.\r\nDeneb, on the other hand, is one of the giant stars, and is at an\r\nimmeasurably great distance from the solar system.\r\n\r\nJust south of Cygnus in the eastern branch of the Milky Way lie\r\nSagitta, The Arrow, and Aquila, The Eagle. Not far to the northeast\r\nof Aquila is the odd little constellation of Delphinus, The Dolphin,\r\npopularly referred to as Job's Coffin. There will be no difficulty in\r\nfinding this small star-group, owing to its peculiar diamond-shaped\r\nconfiguration. Its five principal stars are of the fourth magnitude.\r\nIt is in the constellation of Delphinus that the most distant known\r\nobject in the heavens is located. This is the globular star cluster\r\nknown only by its catalogue number of N.G.C. 7006. It is estimated to\r\nbe at a distance of 220,000 light-years from the earth.\r\n\r\nSagitta, The Arrow, lies midway between Albireo and the brilliant\r\nAltair in Aquila. The point of the arrow is indicated by the star\r\nthat is farthest east; and the feather, by the two faint stars to the\r\nwest. Like Delphinus, this constellation is very small and contains\r\nno objects of particular interest.\r\n\r\nAltair (Flying Eagle) is the brilliant white star of the first\r\nmagnitude in Aquila and is attended by two fainter stars, one on\r\neither side, at nearly equal distances from it. These two stars serve\r\nreadily to distinguish this star, all three stars being nearly in a\r\nstraight line. Altair is one of the nearer stars, its distance from\r\nthe earth being about sixteen light-years. It gives forth about ten\r\ntimes as much light as the sun.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SEPTEMBER--DELPHINUS, AQUILA AND SAGITTA]\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave the constellation of Aquila without referring to\r\nthe wonderful temporary star or nova, known as Nova Aquilæ No. 3\r\n(because it was the third nova to appear in this constellation),\r\nwhich appeared in the position indicated on the chart upon the\r\neighth of June, 1918. A few days previous to this date, there was\r\nin this position an extremely faint star, invisible to the naked\r\neye and in small telescopes. This fact became known from later\r\nexaminations of old photographs of this region that had been taken\r\nat the Harvard College Observatory, where the photographing of the\r\nheavens is carried on regularly for the purpose of having a record\r\nof celestial changes and happenings. Clouds prevented the obtaining\r\nof any photographs of this part of the heavens on the four nights\r\npreceding the eighth of June, but on this evening there shone in the\r\nplace of the faint telescopic star, a wonderful temporary star, or\r\nnova, which was destined on the next evening to outshine all stars\r\nin the heavens, with the exception of the brightest of all, Sirius,\r\nwhich it closely rivaled in brilliancy at the height of its outburst.\r\nWithin less than a week's time, this faint star in the Milky Way for\r\nsome mysterious reason increased in brightness many thousandfold.\r\nSuch outbursts have been recorded before, but on rare occasions,\r\nhowever. No star since the appearance of the nova known as Kepler's\r\nStar, in the year 1604, which at its greatest brilliancy rivaled\r\nJupiter, shone with such splendor or attracted so much attention as\r\nNova Aquilæ. In the year 1901, there appeared in the constellation of\r\nPerseus a star known as Nova Persei which at its brightest surpassed\r\nVega, but its splendor was not as great as that of the wonderful nova\r\nof 1918.\r\n\r\nIt speaks well for the zeal and interest of amateur astronomers, as\r\nwell as for their acquaintance with the stars, that Nova Persei was\r\ndiscovered by an amateur astronomer, Dr. Anderson, and that among\r\nthe deluge of telephone calls and telegrams received at the Harvard\r\nCollege Observatory on the night of June 8th, announcing independent\r\ndiscoveries of the \"new star,\" were many from non-professional\r\nastronomers.\r\n\r\nLike all stars of this class, Nova Aquilæ No. 3 sank rapidly into\r\noblivion. In a few weeks it was only a third-magnitude star; a few\r\nweeks more and it was invisible without a telescope. Many wonderful\r\nand interesting changes have been recorded in the appearance of this\r\nstar, however, even after it became visible only in the telescope.\r\nSoon after its outburst it appeared to develop a nebulous envelope,\r\nas have other novas before it. It showed in addition many of the\r\npeculiarities of the nebulæ, though the central star remained visible\r\nas before the outburst.\r\n\r\nAstronomers are still in doubt as to the cause of these outbursts,\r\nwhich certainly indicate celestial catastrophies of some form on a\r\ngigantic scale. All novas possess one characteristic in common--that\r\nof appearing exclusively in the Milky Way; and another characteristic\r\nis the development of a nebular envelope after the outburst of\r\ngreatest brightness. In some cases temporary stars have been known to\r\nbe variable in brightness for years before the great outburst. Such\r\na star was Nova Aquila, for the examination of photographs of this\r\nregion taken some years previous showed variations in its brightness\r\nfor a period of thirty years at least.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of this century only about thirty novas had\r\nbeen discovered. Since that date, thanks to the vigilance of the\r\nastronomers of today and to the aid of photography, more have been\r\ndiscovered than in all the preceding centuries. These outbursts\r\nof new stars appear to be not so rare as the earlier astronomers\r\nbelieved, though great outbursts as brilliant as that of Nova Aquila\r\nare very uncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nOCTOBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constellations that will be found nearest the meridian in early\r\nOctober evenings are the circumpolar constellations Cepheus and\r\nCassiopeia, and in the southern sky, Capricornus and Aquarius.\r\n\r\nCepheus, The King, and Cassiopeia, his Queen, of whom we shall have\r\nmore to say later in connection with the constellations of Andromeda\r\nand Perseus, sit facing the north pole of the heavens opposite\r\nUrsa Major, The Great Bear, familiar to us under the name of The\r\nBig Dipper. The foot of Cepheus rests upon the tail of the Little\r\nBear, and the star farthest north in the diagram is in the left\r\nknee. The head is marked by a small triangle of faint stars, shown\r\nin the diagram. One of these three faint stars--the one farthest\r\neast--known as Delta Cephei, is a very remarkable variable star,\r\nchanging periodically in brightness every five and one-third days.\r\nIts name has been given to a large class of variable stars--the\r\nCepheid variables--that resemble Delta Cephei in being giant suns,\r\nfaint only because they are at very great distances from the earth,\r\nand varying in brightness with the greatest regularity in periods\r\nthat range from a few hours to several weeks. It has been found that\r\nthe longer the period of light change the greater is the star in\r\nsize and brightness. The Cepheids of longest period are 10,000 times\r\nmore brilliant than our own sun. Cepheus contains no very bright or\r\nconspicuous stars. Alpha Cephei, the brightest star in the group,\r\nmarks The King's right shoulder. It is the star farthest to the west\r\nin the diagram, and is only a third-magnitude star.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OCTOBER--CASSIOPEIA AND CEPHEUS]\r\n\r\nCassiopeia is a constellation with which every one in the northern\r\nhemisphere should be familiar, owing to its very distinctive W-shape\r\nand its far northern position, which brings it conspicuously into\r\nview throughout the clear fall and winter evenings. Cassiopeia is\r\npictured in all star atlases that show the mythological figures,\r\nwith her face toward the north pole. The stars in the W outline the\r\nbody. Alpha, the star farthest south in the diagram marks the breast\r\nof Cassiopeia. Her head and uplifted hands are represented by faint\r\nstars south of Alpha. This star is occasionally referred to by its\r\nArabic name of Schedir. Beta, the leader of all the stars in the W in\r\ntheir daily westward motion, is also known by an Arabic name, Caph.\r\n\r\nIn the constellation of Cassiopeia there appeared in the year 1572\r\nA.D., a wonderful temporary star which suddenly, within a few days'\r\ntime, became as brilliant as the planet Venus and was clearly visible\r\nin broad daylight. This star is often referred to as Tycho's Star,\r\nbecause it was observed, and its position very accurately determined,\r\nby Tycho Brahe, one of the most famous of the old astronomers. This\r\nstar remained visible to every one for about sixteen months, but it\r\nfinally faded completely from view, and it is believed that a faint,\r\nnebulous red star, visible only in the telescope and close to the\r\nposition recorded by Tycho, represents the smoldering embers of the\r\nstar that once struck terror to the hearts of the superstitious and\r\nignorant among all the nations of Europe, who took it to be a sign\r\nthat the end of the world was at hand.\r\n\r\nBoth Cassiopeia and Cepheus lie in the path of the Milky Way, which\r\nreaches its farthest northern point in Cassiopeia and passes from\r\nCepheus in a southerly direction into the constellation of Cygnus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: OCTOBER--AQUARIUS AND CAPRICORNUS]\r\n\r\nTurning now to southern skies, we find on and to the west of the\r\nmeridian at this time the rather inconspicuous zodiacal constellation\r\nof Capricornus, The Goat. It contains no stars of great brightness\r\nand is chiefly remarkable for the fact that it contains one of the\r\nfew double stars that can be seen without the aid of a telescope.\r\nThe least distance in the heavens that the unaided human eye can\r\nseparate is about four minutes of arc. The star Alpha in Capricornus\r\nis made up of two stars separated by a distance of six minutes\r\nof arc, so that any one can readily see that it consists of two\r\nstars very close together. This star, Alpha, will be found in the\r\nextreme western part of the constellation, and can best be located\r\nin conjunction with the star Beta, which is slightly brighter and\r\nlies but a short distance almost due south of Alpha, the two stars\r\nstanding somewhat alone in this part of the heavens.\r\n\r\nTo the north and east of Capricornus we find Aquarius, which is also\r\na zodiacal constellation. Aquarius is the Water-Bearer, and the water\r\njar which he carries is represented by a small, but distinct, Y of\r\nstars from which flows a stream of faint stars toward the southeast\r\nand south. Aquarius, like Capricornus, is a rather uninteresting\r\nconstellation, as it is made up of inconspicuous third- and\r\nfourth-magnitude stars. The entire region covered by these two groups\r\nof stars is remarkably barren, since it contains not a single first-\r\nor even second-magnitude star and little to attract the observer's\r\neye.\r\n\r\nTo relieve the barrenness of this region, there appears just to the\r\nsouth of Aquarius and southeast of Capricornus, sparkling low in the\r\nsouthern sky on crisp October evenings, the beautiful first-magnitude\r\nstar Fomalhaut in the small southern constellation of Piscis\r\nAustralis, The Southern Fish. This star is the farthest south of\r\nall the brilliant first-magnitude stars that can be seen from the\r\nmiddle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. The constellation in\r\nwhich it lies is so close to the southern horizon in our latitudes\r\nthat it cannot be seen to any advantage, and it is at best very\r\ninconspicuous, containing no other objects of interest. Fomalhaut\r\ncannot be mistaken for any other star visible at this time of year\r\nin the evening, since it stands in such a solitary position far to\r\nthe south. At the time of which we are writing it will be found a few\r\ndegrees east of the meridian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nDirectly south of Cassiopeia and Cepheus, the circumpolar\r\nconstellations with which we became acquainted last month, and almost\r\noverhead in our latitudes in the early evening hours of November, lie\r\nPegasus, The Winged Horse, and Andromeda, The Woman Chained.\r\n\r\nAccording to the legend, Cepheus was king of Ethiopia, and Cassiopeia\r\nwas the beautiful, but vain, queen who dared to compare herself in\r\nbeauty with the sea-nymphs. This so enraged the nymphs that, as a\r\npunishment for her presumption, they decided to send a terrible\r\nsea-monster to ravage the coast of the kingdom. The king and queen,\r\nupon consulting the oracle, found that the only way to avert this\r\ncalamity would be to chain their daughter Andromeda to the rocks and\r\npermit the monster to devour her.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NOVEMBER--ANDROMEDA AND PEGASUS]\r\n\r\nAs the story goes, the valiant hero, Perseus, chanced to be riding\r\nthrough the air on his winged horse and saw, far beneath him the\r\nbeautiful maiden chained to the rocks and the frightful monster\r\napproaching to devour her. He immediately went to the rescue, and,\r\nafter a terrible struggle with the monster, succeeded in overpowering\r\nhim and thus saved the maiden from a dreadful fate. Perseus and the\r\nfair Andromeda were married shortly afterward, and at the end of a\r\nhappy life the pair were transferred to the heavens. Cassiopeia, the\r\nvain queen, was ordered to be bound to a chair and, with the king\r\nCepheus at her side, to be swung continually around the north pole of\r\nthe heavens that she might be taught a lesson in humility.\r\n\r\nThe constellation Cetus, representing the sea-monster, will be found\r\nto the southeast and south of Pisces, The Fishes, which lie south of\r\nAndromeda and Pegasus.\r\n\r\nThe Great Square in Pegasus is the most conspicuous configuration\r\nof stars to be seen in the heavens in autumn evenings. The star\r\nthat marks the northeastern corner of The Great Square belongs to\r\nthe constellation of Andromeda and marks the head of the maiden,\r\nwho is resting upon the shoulders of Pegasus, The Winged Horse. The\r\nthree bright stars nearly in a straight line outline the maiden's\r\nbody, Alpha, or Alpheratz, as it is called, being the star in the\r\nhead, Beta or Mirach in the waist, and Gamma or Almach in the left\r\nfoot. The last-named star, which is farthest to the northeast in\r\nthe diagram, was, in the opinion of the noted astronomer Herschel,\r\nthe finest double star in the heavens. The two stars into which the\r\ntelescope splits it are of the beautifully contrasted shades of\r\norange and sea green.\r\n\r\nA second most interesting object in Andromeda and one of the finest\r\nin the entire heavens is The Great Andromeda Nebula, which is faintly\r\nvisible without the aid of a telescope as a hazy patch of light. It\r\nis believed that in reality this nebula is a great universe composed\r\nof many thousands of stars so distant that no telescope can show the\r\nindividual members and that the light from it takes many thousands\r\nof years to span the abyss that separates it from the solar system.\r\nSome magnificent photographs of The Great Andromeda Nebula have been\r\ntaken with powerful telescopes. It is through the use of photography\r\nthat the nebulæ can best be studied, for a photographic plate after\r\nlong exposure, reveals a wonderful detail in the structure of these\r\nobjects that the human eye fails to see. On a clear, dark evening\r\none may find The Great Andromeda Nebula by the aid of two faint stars\r\nwith which it makes a small triangle, as shown in the chart. This\r\nnebula is the only one of the spiral nebula that can be seen in these\r\nlatitudes without the aid of a telescope, though there are several\r\nspiral nebulæ in the southern heavens that can be thus seen.\r\n\r\nLying to the northwest of The Great Square in Pegasus are a number of\r\nfaint stars that outline the shoulders and head of the winged steed,\r\nwhile the stars to the southwest of the square outline his forelegs.\r\nThe creature is represented without hind quarters in all star\r\natlases. The space within The Great Square contains no bright stars,\r\nand as a result, the outline of the square stands out with great\r\ndistinctness. There are, in fact, no stars of the first magnitude in\r\neither Pegasus or Andromeda, though there are a number of the second\r\nand third magnitude which very clearly show the distinctive forms of\r\nthese two star-groups.\r\n\r\nPisces, The Fishes, the constellation just south of Andromeda and\r\nPegasus, is the first of the twelve zodiacal constellations. It\r\nconsists of the southern fish, lying in an east-to-west direction,\r\nand the northern fish, lying nearly north and south, the two touching\r\nat the southeastern extremity of the constellation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: NOVEMBER--PISCES]\r\n\r\nThere is in Pisces not a single bright star, and its only point of\r\ninterest is to be found in the fact that it contains the point,\r\nmarked by the cross and letter V in the diagram, that is known\r\nvariously as \"the vernal equinox,\" \"the equinoctial point\" and \"The\r\nFirst Point in Aries.\" This is a very important point of reference\r\nin the heavens, just as the meridian of Greenwich is for the earth,\r\nand it marks the point where the sun crosses the equator going north\r\nin the spring. Owing to the Precession of the Equinoxes, as it is\r\ncalled, this point is gradually shifting its position westward\r\nthrough the zodiacal constellations at a rate that will carry it\r\ncompletely around the heavens through the twelve zodiacal groups in\r\na period of 25,800 years. Since the beginning of the Christian era,\r\nthis point has backed from the constellation of Aries, which lies\r\njust east of Pisces, into Pisces, though it still retains its name of\r\n\"The First Point in Aries.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nDECEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eastern half of the sky on early December evenings is adorned\r\nwith some of the finest star-groups in the heavens; but as we are\r\nconsidering for each month only the constellations that lie on or\r\nnear the meridian in the early evening hours, we must turn our\r\neyes for the present from the sparkling brilliants in the east to\r\nthe stars in the less conspicuous groups of Aries, The Ram, and\r\nCetus, The Whale. We will also become acquainted this month with\r\nthe beautiful and interesting constellation of Perseus, the hero of\r\nmythical fame to whom we referred last month in connection with the\r\nlegend of Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Cetus, you will recall, represents\r\nthe sea-monster sent to devour Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus and\r\nCassiopeia. We have included the constellation of Andromeda in our\r\ndiagram for this month, since it is so closely associated in legend\r\nwith the constellations of Perseus and Cetus, though we also showed\r\nit last month.\r\n\r\nThe brightest star in Perseus, known as Alpha Persei, is at the\r\ncenter of a curved line of stars that is concave or hollow toward\r\nthe northeast. This line of stars is called the Segment of Perseus,\r\nand it lies along the path of the Milky Way, which passes from this\r\npoint in a northwesterly direction into Cassiopeia. According to the\r\nlegend, Perseus, in his great haste to rescue the maiden from Cetus,\r\nthe monster, stirred up a great dust, which is represented by the\r\nnumberless faint stars in the Milky Way at this point. The star Alpha\r\nis in the midst of one of the finest regions of the heavens for the\r\npossessor of a good field-glass or small telescope.\r\n\r\nA short distance to the southwest of Alpha is one of the most\r\ninteresting objects in the heavens. To the ancients, it represented\r\nthe baleful, winking demon-eye in the head of the snaky-locked\r\nGorgon, Medusa, whom Perseus vanquished in one of his earliest\r\nexploits and whose head he carried in his hand at the time of the\r\nrescue of Andromeda. To the astronomers, however, Algol is known\r\nas Beta Persei, a star that has been found to consist of two stars\r\nrevolving about each other and separated by a distance not much\r\ngreater than their own diameters. One of the stars is so faint that\r\nwe speak of it as a dark star, though it does emit a faint light.\r\nOnce in every revolution the faint star passes directly between us\r\nand the bright star and partly eclipses it, shutting off five-sixths\r\nof its light. This happens with great regularity once in a little\r\nless than three days. It is for this reason that Algol varies in\r\nbrightness in this period. There are a number of stars that vary in\r\nbrightness in a similar manner. Their periods of light-change are all\r\nvery short, and the astronomers call them eclipsing variables. At\r\nits brightest, Algol is slightly brighter than the star nearest to\r\nit in Andromeda, which is an excellent star with which to compare it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DECEMBER--PERSEUS, ARIES AND CETUS]\r\n\r\nPerseus is another one of the constellations lying in the Milky Way\r\nin which temporary stars or novas have suddenly flashed forth. At the\r\npoint indicated by a cross in the diagram, Dr. Anderson, an amateur\r\nastronomer of Scotland, found on February 21, 1901, a new star as\r\nbrilliant as the pole-star. On the following day it became brighter\r\nthan a star of the first magnitude. A day later it had lost a third\r\nof its light, and in a few weeks it was invisible without the aid\r\nof a telescope. In a year it was invisible in all except the most\r\npowerful telescopes. With such telescopes, it may still be seen as a\r\nvery faint nebulous light.\r\n\r\nTriangulum and Aries are two rather inconspicuous constellations that\r\nlie on, or close to, the meridian at this time. There is nothing\r\nremarkable about either of these groups, except that Aries is one of\r\nthe twelve zodiacal constellations. Some centuries ago, the sun was\r\nto be found in Aries at the beginning of spring and the position it\r\noccupies in the sky at that time was called the First Point in Aries.\r\nAs this point is slowly shifting westward, as we have explained\r\nelsewhere, the sun is now to be found in Pisces, instead of Aries at\r\nthe beginning of spring and does not enter Aries until a month later.\r\nPisces was one of the constellations for November and we showed in\r\nthat constellation the present position of the sun at the beginning\r\nof spring.\r\n\r\nTwo stars in Aries--Alpha and Beta--are fairly bright, Alpha being\r\nfully as bright as the brightest star in Andromeda. Beta lies a short\r\ndistance to the southwest of Alpha, and a little to the southwest\r\nof Beta is Gamma, the three stars forming a short curved line of\r\nstars that distinguishes this constellation from other groups. The\r\nremaining stars in Aries are all faint.\r\n\r\nJust south of Aries lies the head of Cetus, The Whale. This is an\r\nenormous constellation that extends far to the southwest, below\r\na part of Pisces, which runs in between Andromeda and Cetus. Its\r\nbrightest star, Beta, Diphda, or Deneb Kaitos, as it is severally\r\ncalled, stands quite alone not far above the southwestern horizon.\r\nIt is almost due south of Alpha Andromedæ, the star in Andromeda\r\nfarthest to the west, which it exactly equals in brightness. The head\r\nof Cetus is marked by a five-sided figure composed of stars that are\r\nall faint with the single exception of Alpha, which is fairly bright,\r\nthough inferior to Beta or Diphda.\r\n\r\nCetus, though made up chiefly of faint stars, and on the whole\r\nuninteresting, contains one of the most peculiar objects in the\r\nheavens, the star known as Omicron Ceti or Mira (The Wonderful). This\r\nstar suddenly rises from invisibility nearly to the brightness of a\r\nfirst-magnitude star for a short period once every eleven months.\r\nMira was the first known variable star. Its remarkable periodic\r\nchange in brightness was discovered by Fabricius in the year 1596, so\r\nits peculiar behavior has been under observation for three hundred\r\nand twenty-five years. It is called a long-period variable star,\r\nbecause its variations of light take place in a period of months\r\ninstead of a few hours or days, as is the case with stars such as\r\nAlgol. Mira is not only a wonderful star, it is a mysterious star\r\nas well, for the cause of its light-changes are not known, as in\r\nthe case of Algol where the loss of light is produced by a dark\r\nstar passing in front of a brighter star. Mira is a deep-red star,\r\nas are all long-period variable stars that change irregularly in\r\nbrightness. It is visible without a telescope for only one month or\r\nsix weeks out of the eleven months. During the remainder of this\r\ntime, it sometimes loses so much of its light that it cannot be found\r\nwith telescopes of considerable size. Its periods of light-change are\r\nquite variable as is also the amount of light it gains at different\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the cause of the light-changes of Mira is to be\r\nfound within the star itself. It has been thought that dense clouds\r\nof vapors may surround these comparatively cool, red stars and that\r\nthe imprisoned heat finally bursts through these vapors and we see\r\nfor a short time the glowing gases below; then the vapors once more\r\ncollect for a long period, to be followed by another sudden outburst\r\nof heat and light.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to remember in this connection that our own sun has\r\nbeen found to be slightly variable in the amount of light and heat\r\nthat it gives forth at different times, and the cause of its changes\r\nin light and heat are believed to lie within the sun itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nSTARS OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs one travels southward from the mid-latitudes of the northern\r\nhemisphere into the tropics our familiar circumpolar constellations\r\nsink lower and lower in the northern heavens and strange and\r\nunfamiliar star-groups rise gradually above the southern horizon.\r\nIf we make our southward journey in the winter months the first of\r\nthe southern constellations to come fully into view is the small\r\nstar-group just south of Lepus known as Columba (The Dove), whose\r\nbrightest star Phact is of the second magnitude. A line drawn from\r\nProcyon to Sirius and extended as far again brings us to this star\r\nand a line from Betelgeuze to Sirius extended an equal distance\r\nbrings us to Zeta Argus which is equal to Phact in brightness. The\r\ntwo lines intersecting at Sirius make the \"Egyptian X\" as it is\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nMagnificent, blue-white Canopus, the most brilliant star in the\r\nheavens next to Sirius, a veritable diamond sparkling low in the\r\nsouthern sky, now commands our unqualified admiration. Canopus lies\r\nabout 35° south of Sirius and is invisible north of the 37th parallel\r\nof latitude. At nine o'clock in the evening of February 6th it can be\r\nseen just above the southern horizon in that latitude and is then a\r\nconspicuous object in Georgia, Florida and the Gulf States.\r\n\r\n    \"The star of Egypt whose proud light\r\n    Never hath beamed on those who rest\r\n    In the White Islands of the West.\"\r\n\r\nwrites Moore of Canopus in \"Lalla Rookh.\"\r\n\r\nAlong the Nile Canopus was an object of worship as the god of waters.\r\nAt the time of their erection, 6400 B.C., a number of temples in\r\nUpper Egypt were oriented so as to show Canopus at sunrise at the\r\nautumnal equinox, and other temples erected many centuries later were\r\noriented in a similar manner. In China, as late as 100 B.C., and in\r\nIndia also Canopus was an object of worship.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer tells us that Canopus is immeasurably distant from the\r\nearth. It has been estimated to be forty thousand times more luminous\r\nthan our sun.\r\n\r\nCanopus is located in the constellation of Argo Navis which is\r\nthe largest and most conspicuous constellation in the heavens.\r\nIn addition to Canopus it contains a number of second- and\r\nthird-magnitude stars and is subdivided for convenience into Puppis,\r\nThe Prow; Carina, The Keel; and Vela, The Sails. Huge as it is,\r\nArgo Navis represents only half of a ship for the stern is lacking.\r\nAccording to the legend this ship was built by Argos, aided by\r\nPallas Athene, for Jason, the leader of the expedition of the fifty\r\nArgonauts who sailed from Greece to Colchis in search of the golden\r\nfleece. Pallas Athene placed in the bow of the ship a piece of\r\ntimber from the speaking oak of Dodona to guide the crew and warn\r\nthem of dangers and after the voyage the ship was supposed to have\r\nbeen placed in the heavens.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS--1. IN FEBRUARY]\r\n\r\nIn Argo Navis is one of the finest telescopic objects in the heavens,\r\nthe Keyhole Nebula, as it is usually called, from a peculiar-shaped\r\ndark patch in its brightest part. On the border of this nebula is the\r\ndeep-red Wonder Star of the southern hemisphere, Eta Argus, which\r\nvaries suddenly and unexpectedly in brightness between the seventh\r\nand first magnitudes. In 1843 it burst forth with a splendor rivaling\r\nSirius and maintained this brilliancy for nearly ten years and then\r\nslowly waned in brilliancy until it disappeared to the unaided eye\r\nin 1886. The surrounding nebula also seems to share in its peculiar\r\nfluctuations of brightness. Eta Argus is now a star of the seventh\r\nmagnitude and since it is still varying fitfully in brightness it is\r\nbelieved that the history of its light-changes is not complete.\r\n\r\nAmong the constellations of the southern heavens near the meridian\r\nin February we see in addition to Argo Navis the constellations\r\nof Dorado, The Goldfish; Hydrus, The Serpent, and Tucana, The\r\nToucan. Though insignificant in appearance Dorado contains what was\r\ndescribed by Sir John Herschel as one of the most extraordinary\r\nobjects in the heavens, a worthy rival of The Great Orion Nebula and\r\nin some respects very similar to it, The Great Looped Nebula, \"the\r\ncenter of a great spiral.\" In Dorado also is located The Greater\r\nMagellanic Cloud which looks like a detached portion of the Milky\r\nWay though it is far removed from it. To the naked eye it resembles\r\na small white cloud about 4° in extent. In the telescope it bears a\r\nclose resemblance to a typical portion of the Milky Way. A similar\r\nformation known as The Lesser Magellanic Cloud is located in Hydrus.\r\nIt has been estimated that the distance of The Lesser Cloud is 80,000\r\nlight-years and that it is receding from us.\r\n\r\nIn Tucana is located one of the finest globular star clusters in\r\nthe heavens, known as 47 Tucanæ. This cluster and Omega Centauri,\r\na globular star cluster in Centaurus, are the two nearest of all\r\nthe globular clusters. They are distant from the earth about 22,000\r\nlight-years and it is known that the combined light of the thousands\r\nof stars of which each cluster is composed is about one million times\r\nthat of our own sun.\r\n\r\nIn the western sky in the southern hemisphere in February may be seen\r\nthe brilliant, white, first-magnitude star Achernar in the river\r\nEridanus, the long, winding constellation that, we recall, starts\r\nnear the brilliant Rigel in Orion and disappears from the view of\r\nnorthern observers below the southern horizon, extending its course\r\nfar into the southern hemisphere. Achernar means \"The End of the\r\nRiver\" and this is nearly its position in the constellation.\r\n\r\nThough Argo Navis is the largest and most important constellation of\r\nthe southern hemisphere, Crux, The Southern Cross, far-famed in story\r\nand legend as well as for its historical associations, is beyond a\r\ndoubt the most popular.\r\n\r\nThe best time to view the Southern Cross is in June or July when\r\nit is near the meridian. It is not seen to advantage in the months\r\nof January or February. It then lies on its side and close to the\r\nhorizon and therefore is dimmed by atmospheric haze so that it almost\r\ninvariably is a disappointing object to the tourist from the north\r\nwho usually views it for the first time in one of these months. The\r\nCross is viewed to advantage in the latitude of Rio or Valparaiso\r\nand it is best seen from the Straits where it rides high overhead.\r\nIt is not seen to advantage from the latitudes of Cuba or Jamaica.\r\nIt is small, only 6° in extent from north to south and less in width\r\nand it lies in the most brilliant portion of the Milky Way which is\r\nhere a narrow stream only three or four degrees wide. Directly below\r\nthe Cross is the noted Coal Sack, apparently a yawning chasm in the\r\nmidst of its brilliant surroundings though probably in reality a dark\r\nnebula. Viewed with the telescopes a number of stars are to be seen\r\nprojected on this dark background.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Cross is to the inhabitants of the southern hemisphere\r\nwhat the Big Dipper is to those who dwell in the northern\r\nhemisphere--an infallible timepiece. The upright of the Cross points\r\ntoward the south pole of the heavens which lies in a region where\r\nthere is a singular dearth of bright stars, the nearest star to the\r\nsouth pole being a faint fifth-magnitude star called Sigma Octantis.\r\nWhen seen in the southeast or southwest the Cross lies on its side,\r\nbut when passing the meridian it stands nearly upright. Humboldt,\r\nreferring to this fact, says:\r\n\r\n  \"How often have we heard our guides exclaim in the savannahs of\r\n  Venezuela and in the desert extending from Lima to Truxillo,\r\n  'Midnight is past, the Cross begins to bend.'\"\r\n\r\nBy the explorers of the sixteenth century the Cross was taken as\r\na sign of heaven's approval of their attempt to establish the\r\nChristian religion in the wilds of the New World. This thought is\r\nbeautifully expressed in Mrs. Hemans' lines in \"The Cross of the\r\nSouth.\"\r\n\r\n    \"But to thee, as thy lode-stars resplendently burn\r\n    In their clear depths of blue, with devotion I turn\r\n    Bright Cross of the South! and beholding thee shine,\r\n    Scarce regret the loved land of the olive and vine.\r\n    Thou recallest the ages when first o'er the main\r\n    My fathers unfolded the ensign of Spain,\r\n    And planted their faith in the regions that see\r\n    Its imperishing symbol ever blazoned in thee.\"\r\n\r\nAlpha Crucis, the brightest star in Crux, is at the foot of the\r\nCross. It consists in reality of two second-magnitude stars forming a\r\nbeautiful double while a third fifth-magnitude star one and one-half\r\nminutes of arc distant makes with this pair a combination similar to\r\nour Mizar and Alcor of the Big Dipper though the separation is not\r\ngreat enough to be visible to the naked eye. The second-magnitude\r\nstar at the head of the Cross is a deep orange in color and the two\r\nstars that mark the ends of the cross-arm are white third-magnitude\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SOUTHERN CONSTELLATIONS--2. IN JULY]\r\n\r\nOne of the finest constellations of the southern hemisphere is\r\nCentaurus, The Centaur, which surrounds Crux on the north and is more\r\nthan 60° in length. Its center lies about 50° south of Spica in Virgo\r\nand below the tail of Hydra. Alpha Centauri, its brightest star and\r\nthe nearest star to the solar system, four and one-third light-years\r\naway, is a golden-yellow double star that forms with the star Beta\r\nCentauri on the west a configuration similar to that of Castor and\r\nPollux in Gemini, only one that is far more striking because of the\r\nsuperior brilliancy of the stars. Alpha Centauri lies in the Milky\r\nWay and transits the meridian at the same time with Arcturus though\r\nit cannot be seen north of the 29th parallel. Alpha Centauri, like\r\nCanopus, was an object of worship in Egypt and a number of temples in\r\nnorthern Egypt were oriented to its emergence from the sun's rays in\r\nthe morning at the autumnal equinox, between 3000 and 2575 B.C.\r\n\r\nNorth of Centaurus is the constellation Lupus, The Wolf, which is\r\nalso crossed by the Milky Way. According to one myth Lupus is held\r\nin the right hand of the Centaur as an offering upon the altar which\r\nis represented by the constellation of Ara next to Centaurus on the\r\neast. Ara also is crossed by the Milky Way. Neither Lupus nor Ara\r\ncontain any objects that are worthy of special attention.\r\n\r\nTriangulum Australe, The Southern Triangle, a little to the southeast\r\nof Alpha Centauri, is far more conspicuous than the Triangulum of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying charts give two views of these principal southern\r\nconstellations that lie within 40° of the south pole of the heavens\r\nand that are below the horizon in 40° north latitude. The first of\r\nthese charts shows the constellations that are nearest the meridian\r\nin the early evening hours in February. Canopus in Argo Navis and the\r\nGreater Magellanic Cloud then lie close to the meridian. Argo Navis\r\nwith its subdivisions Puppis, Vela and Carina are found east of the\r\nmeridian lying directly in the path of the Milky Way, which stretches\r\ndiagonally across the sky from the northwest to the southeast. Far\r\nover in the southeast appears Crux, the Southern Cross, also directly\r\nin the path of the Milky Way. In the western heavens may be seen the\r\nLesser Magellanic Cloud in Hydrus, brilliant Achernar in Eridanus\r\nand the inconspicuous star-group of Tucana.\r\n\r\nIn the early evening hours of July we find as shown on the second\r\nchart, Alpha and Beta Centauri in Centaurus close to the meridian,\r\nLupus due north of Centaurus, Ara and Triangulum Australe in the\r\nsoutheast and Crux in fine position for observation just west of the\r\nmeridian. Carina of Argo Navis lies to the southwest of Crux. The\r\nMilky Way now arches magnificently across the heavens from Carina\r\nthrough Crux, Centaurus and Lupus and Ara to the zodiacal groups of\r\nScorpio and Sagittarius in the northeast.\r\n\r\nIn the northern part of the heavens, as seen from the southern\r\nhemisphere, appear the familiar zodiacal constellations that we of\r\nthe northern hemisphere find south of the zenith, as well as the\r\nconstellations of Orion, Lepus and Canis Major, Hydra, Corvus and\r\nCrater, Ophiuchus and Serpens and Aquila, all finely in view in their\r\nappropriate seasons.\r\n\r\nIt is only our familiar circumpolar constellations of the north--The\r\nTwo Bears, Draco, Cassiopeia, and Cepheus, Andromeda and Perseus and\r\nAuriga that are invisible in mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere\r\njust as the constellations shown in the diagrams, and a few\r\nadditional groups such as Pavo, Grus, Phoenix, Apus, Mensa and Volans\r\nwhich we have not shown, lie hidden from view beneath the southern\r\nhorizon in mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe northern visitor to the southern hemisphere familiar with the\r\nconstellations of his own land is filled with a queer sensation of\r\nbeing in topsy-turvydom as he sees familiar Orion standing on his\r\nhead and all of the zodiacal constellations passing in their daily\r\nmotions to the north instead of to the south of his zenith while\r\nby day the sun passes across the northern part of the heavens and\r\nculminates north instead of south of his zenith. He misses the\r\nfamiliar Dippers of his own land and searches in vain for a pole-star\r\nin the unfamiliar circumpolar regions of the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nTHE MILKY WAY OR GALAXY\r\n\r\n    \"Broad and ample road whose dust is gold,\r\n    And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear\r\n    Seen in the galaxy, that milky way\r\n    Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest\r\n    Powder'd with stars.\"\r\n\r\n                        --MILTON, _Paradise Lost_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn clear, winter evenings one may see a portion of the zone of\r\nthe Milky Way, which encircles the heavens, arching magnificently\r\nacross the heavens as it passes from Cassiopeia and Cepheus in the\r\nnorthwest, through Perseus and Auriga and the eastern part of Taurus,\r\nacross the feet of Gemini, between Canis Minor and Orion and through\r\nthe eastern part of Canis Major to the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nAt this point it passes beyond our range of vision into the\r\nstar-groups of Puppis, Vela and Carina, subdivisions of the huge\r\nsouthern constellation of Argo Navis. It reaches its greatest\r\ndistance south of the celestial equator and also attains its greatest\r\nbrilliancy in Crux, the far-famed Southern Cross. From here it turns\r\nnorthward once more, passing into Centaurus, Musca, Circinus Ara and\r\nLupus constellations of the southern hemisphere and comes within our\r\nrange of vision again in Sagittarius and Scorpio. Here the Milky Way\r\ndivides into two branches, though some astronomers now believe that\r\nthis apparent division into two branches is due to the presence of an\r\nenormous cloud of non-luminous matter lying along the course of the\r\nMilky Way at this point, similar in its nature to the dark \"holes\"\r\nand \"caves\" and streaks that appear in all portions of the Milky Way\r\nand most noticeably athwart its course in Argo and Centaurus.\r\n\r\nOne of these branches of the Milky Way passes from Sagittarius\r\nthrough Aquila to Cygnus and the other through Scorpio, Ophiuchus and\r\nSerpens to Cygnus, the two extending diagonally across the heavens\r\nin the late summer and early fall evenings from the northeast to\r\nthe southwest. From Cygnus, the Milky Way passes into Cepheus and\r\nCassiopeia and thus completes its circuit of the heavens.\r\n\r\nIt is not seen to advantage in spring or early summer evenings\r\nbecause it then rests nearly on the horizon. Its plane is inclined\r\nabout 63° to the celestial equator and its poles lie in the\r\nconstellations of Coma Berenicis and Cetus. These are the two points\r\nthat lie farthest from the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way has been called the groundwork of the universe. By far\r\nthe greater number of all the stars are crowded towards its plane in\r\nthe form of an enormous flattened disk or lens.\r\n\r\nOur solar system, it has been estimated, lies close to the plane of\r\nthe Milky Way and at a distance of some 50,000 or 60,000 light-years\r\nfrom its center. The diameter of the Milky Way as deduced from Dr.\r\nHarlow Shapley's work on globular star clusters is about 300,000\r\nlight-years in extent, or ten times greater than the limit set some\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe apparent crowding together of the stars into dense clouds in the\r\nMilky Way is partly an effect due to our position in the Milky Way.\r\nWhen we look at the heavens in a direction at right angles to this\r\nplane we find comparatively few stars lying along our line of vision\r\nbecause the stars are actually fewer in number in this direction.\r\nIf we look _along_ the plane of the Milky Way, however, we see\r\nto a greater distance through an enormous depth of stars. Though\r\nindividual stars may not be much closer together in the Milky Way\r\nthan they are outside of it, there are on the whole more of them and\r\nthe effect of greater density is produced.\r\n\r\nFather Hagen of the Vatican Observatory, who has for years made a\r\nstudy of the dark clouds of obscuring matter and dark nebulæ that\r\nabound in space, has found evidence of the existence of many vast\r\nclouds of dark obscuring matter over the entire heavens above and\r\nbelow the plane of the Milky Way as well as surrounding the Milky\r\nWay in its own plane. The existence of such clouds of non-luminous\r\nmatter would account partly for the comparative fewness of stars in\r\nspace outside of the plane of the Milky Way since many stars would be\r\nconcealed from our eyes by these obscuring clouds. There is, however,\r\nin addition, an actual crowding of all the visible stars toward this\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nThe peoples of all ages have honored the Milky Way in story and\r\nlegend. It has been universally referred to as The Sky River and The\r\nPathway of Souls. To the little Hiawatha, we remember, the \"wrinkled\r\nold Nakomis\"\r\n\r\n    \"Showed the broad white road in heaven\r\n    Pathway of the ghosts, the shadows,\r\n    Running straight across the heavens,\r\n    Crowded with the ghosts, the shadows.\r\n    To the Kingdom of Ponemah\r\n    To the land of the hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nIn _The Galaxy_, Longfellow thus describes the Milky Way:\r\n\r\n    \"Torrent of light and river of the air\r\n    Along whose bed the glimmering stars are seen\r\n    Like gold and silver sands in some ravine\r\n    Where mountain streams have left their channels bare!\"\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, where the Milky Way arches high through the zenith in\r\nwinter, it is called the Winter Street, and Miss Edith Thomas writes\r\nthus beautifully of it in her poem entitled, \"The Winter Street\":\r\n\r\n    \"Silent with star dust, yonder it lies--\r\n      The Winter Street, so fair and so white;\r\n    Winding along through the boundless skies,\r\n      Down heavenly vale, up heavenly height.\r\n\r\n    Faintly it gleams, like a summer road\r\n      When the light in the west is sinking low,\r\n    Silent with star dust! By whose abode\r\n      Does the Winter Street in its windings go?\r\n\r\n    And who are they, all unheard and unseen--\r\n      O who are they, whose blessèd feet\r\n    Pass over that highway smooth and sheen?\r\n      What pilgrims travel the Winter Street?\r\n\r\n    Are they not those whom here we miss\r\n      In the ways and the days that are vacant below?\r\n    As the dust of that Street their footfalls kiss\r\n      Does it not brighter and brighter grow?\"\r\n\r\nBeautiful indeed are these poetic fancies but none of them picture\r\neven remotely the awe-inspiring grandeur of the Milky Way as it\r\nactually exists.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A DARK NEBULA: THE DARK BAY OR DARK HORSE NEBULA IN\r\n  ORION\r\n  Taken with 100-inch Hooker Telescope of the Mt. Wilson Observatory]\r\n\r\nMillions upon millions of far distant suns equal to or surpassing\r\nour own sun in brilliancy are gathered within this vast encircling\r\nzone of the heavens, their combined light giving to the naked eye the\r\nimpression of a milky band of light. Nine-tenths of all the stars, it\r\nhas been estimated, lie close to the plane of the Galaxy, as well as\r\nall the vast expanses of luminous gaseous nebulæ and clouds of dark\r\nobscuring matter all seemingly intermingled in chaotic confusion;\r\nyet law and order govern the motions of all. Here also are the great\r\nmoving star clusters such as the Pleiades and the Hyades and all of\r\nthe brilliant \"Orion\" stars.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Milky Way is not clearly understood but many\r\nastronomers believe there is evidence that it takes the form of a\r\nvast spiral nebula along whose arms the stars pass to and fro.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Milky Way at enormous distances of many thousands of\r\nlight-years, but apparently influenced by it, lie the globular\r\nstar-clusters and the spiral nebulæ. The spirals appear to avoid the\r\nplane of the Milky Way for they are receding in the direction of its\r\npoles at high velocities; the globular clusters on the other hand\r\nare drawing in toward the Milky Way on either side, and in time will\r\ncross it.\r\n\r\nWhether these objects external to the Milky Way form with it one\r\nenormous universe or whether the spiral nebulæ are in turn galaxies\r\nor \"island universes,\" as the astronomer calls them, similar in form\r\nand structure to our own galaxy and at inconceivably great distances\r\nof millions of light-years from it, is still one of the riddles of\r\nthe universe which the astronomers are attempting to solve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE SURFACE OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visible surface of the sun is called the _photosphere_. Even the\r\nsmallest telescopes will show its peculiar \"rice-grain\" structure,\r\nconsisting of intensely brilliant flecks or nodules about 500 miles\r\nin diameter, which can be resolved by the more powerful telescopes\r\ninto smaller particles about 100 miles in diameter, against a darker\r\nbackground. It has been estimated that these bright nodules or\r\nrice-grains occupy only one-fifth of the total surface of the sun,\r\nyet radiate three-fourths of the total light.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that the \"rice grains\" are the summits of\r\nhighly heated columns of gas, arising from the sun's interior, and\r\nthat the darker portions between are cooler descending currents.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the photosphere or visible surface of the sun\r\nappears to be much brighter in the center of the disk than near its\r\ncircumference. This is due entirely to its gaseous nature and to\r\nthe fact that it is surrounded by an atmosphere of dense enveloping\r\ncooler gases. Rays from the center of the disk travel a shorter\r\ndistance through this atmosphere than the rays from the rim and\r\ntherefore are absorbed less by surrounding gases. We look further\r\ndown into the sun's interior near the center of the disk than in the\r\ndirection of its circumference and so the light appears more intense\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe photosphere is the region where sun-spots appear and they are\r\nfound in zones extending from 8° to 35° on either side of the solar\r\nequator, never appearing exactly at the equator or near the poles.\r\n\r\nThe disturbances that produce sun-spots and many allied phenomena\r\noccur cyclically in periods of eleven years on the average. The\r\nfirst outburst of the disturbance is manifested by the appearance\r\nof sun-spots in high solar latitudes. These break out and disappear\r\nand break out again with increased vigor, working gradually downward\r\ntoward the solar equator, the maximum spottedness for a given period\r\noccurring in solar latitude about 16°. The disturbance finally dies\r\nout within 8° or 10° of the equator, but even before one cycle of\r\ndisturbance has entirely passed away a new cycle has broken forth in\r\nhigh latitudes. So during the period of minimum spottedness there\r\nare four distinct belts, two in low latitudes, due to the dying\r\ndisturbance, and two in high latitudes, due to the new disturbance.\r\nAt sun-spot maximums there are two well-marked zones of great\r\nintensity, approximately 16° north and south of the sun's equator.\r\n\r\nSun-spots are solar cyclones, occurring usually in groups, though\r\nlarge single spots appear less frequently. Each spot is quite sharply\r\ndivided into an umbra and a penumbra. The umbra is the darker central\r\nportion, the funnel of the whirling cyclone, and the penumbra is\r\ncomposed of the outspreading gases, and is less dark than the umbra.\r\nThe peculiar \"thatch-straw\" structure of the penumbra is due, it\r\nis believed, to the fact that the columns of gases that usually\r\nrise vertically from the sun's interior and from the \"rice grains\"\r\nof the photosphere are drawn into a horizontal position by the\r\nwhirling motion that exists in the penumbra regions of a sun-spot and\r\ntherefore we get a longitudinal rather than a cross sectional view of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe umbra of a sun-spot is anywhere from a few hundred miles to fifty\r\nthousand miles in diameter, frequently exceeding the earth in size,\r\nwhile the penumbra occasionally reaches a diameter of two hundred\r\nthousand miles. Sun-spots of exceptional size can be seen even\r\nwithout the aid of a telescope.\r\n\r\nThe darkness of sun-spots is only by comparison with their more\r\nbrilliant background. Owing to the rapid expansion and cooling of\r\ngases the temperature in sun-spot regions is far below the normal\r\nsolar temperature of 6,000° Centigrade, lying between 3,000° and\r\n4,000° Centigrade. At this temperature it is possible for the more\r\nrefractory chemical compounds to form, the oxides and the hydrides,\r\nand the spectra of sun-spots reveal the presence of titanium oxide\r\nand magnesium and calcium hydride. At the higher solar temperatures\r\nthat exist elsewhere in the photosphere and in its overlying gaseous\r\nenvelopes all chemical elements occur in a free state, intermingling\r\nas incandescent vapors without the formation of any chemical\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nStrong magnetic fields exist in sun-spot regions and magnetic\r\nstorms in our own atmosphere frequently accompany the appearance of\r\nexceptionally large sun-spots.\r\n\r\nDirectly above the photosphere of the sun lies the \"reversing layer,\"\r\nwhich is about five hundred miles in depth and is composed of the\r\nincandescent vapors of all the chemical elements that exist on the\r\nsun, which are also the same familiar elements that exist on the\r\nearth, with the exception of coronium, the unknown element in the\r\nsolar corona, there is no element in the sun that has not been found\r\non our own planet.\r\n\r\nThe \"reversing layer\" receives its name from the fact that it\r\nreverses the solar spectrum. It produces by its absorption of the\r\nrays of light from gases below the dark absorption lines found in the\r\nspectrum that serve to identify all the elements existing in the sun.\r\nDuring the time immediately preceding and following a total eclipse\r\nof the sun this reversing layer produces what is known as the flash\r\nspectrum. When the photosphere, which gives the bright continuous\r\nbackground of the solar spectrum, is concealed by the moon, the\r\nnormally dark lines of the reversing layer--dark only by contrast\r\nwith the bright background--become momentarily intensely bright lines\r\nagainst a dark background. The flash spectrum only lasts a second or\r\nso, as the reversing layer itself is soon covered by the moon.\r\n\r\nJust above the reversing layer lies the _chromosphere_, which is\r\nbetween five thousand and ten thousand miles in depth. Many of the\r\ngaseous vapors of the reversing layer are found in the chromosphere,\r\nthrown there continually by the vast upheavals of gases that are\r\nconstantly disturbing the surface of the sun. The greater the solar\r\nactivity the more is the chromosphere charged with the vapors of\r\nthe lower strata of the sun's atmosphere. The gases that are most\r\ncharacteristic of the chromosphere, however, are the incandescent\r\ngases of hydrogen and calcium, which give it the pink or reddish\r\ntinge so noticeable during total solar eclipse. Helium is also found\r\nin great abundance in the solar chromosphere.\r\n\r\nShooting upward from the photosphere with the tremendous velocity of\r\none hundred or more miles per second, can be seen at all times, by\r\nproperly screening off the light from the photosphere, the vast solar\r\neruptions known as the _prominences_. These are composed chiefly\r\nof hydrogen and calcium gas, though other elements also appear,\r\nespecially near the bases of the prominences. Prominences are of two\r\nvarieties, the quiescent, or cloud-like prominences, that float high\r\nabove the solar surface for days at a time in some instances and\r\nresemble terrestrial clouds in form, and the eruptive, or metallic\r\nprominences, that dart up from the surface of the sun in an infinite\r\nvariety of forms that may be entirely changed in the short interval\r\nof fifteen or twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nThese eruptive prominences usually attain heights of thirty or forty\r\nthousand miles on the average, but _exceptional prominences reach\r\nheights of more than one hundred thousand miles and in a few rare\r\ncases have reached elevations of over five hundred thousand miles,\r\nor more than one-half of the solar diameter_.\r\n\r\nProminences are the most spectacular and beautiful of all solar\r\nphenomena, with the possible exception of the solar corona, which is\r\nthe outermost of all the solar envelopes and also the most tenuous.\r\nThe extent of the corona is enormous. Its outer streamers extend\r\nusually to distances of several million miles from the center of the\r\nsun. Measurements of the coronal light during total eclipses of the\r\nsun have shown that its intensity is only about one-half that of\r\nfull moonlight, and it seems almost impossible to devise methods for\r\ndetecting it, except during total eclipses, on account of the extreme\r\nfaintness of its light.\r\n\r\nThe sun, it is now known, is surrounded by a strong magnetic field in\r\naddition to the magnetic fields that exist in sun-spots. The cycle\r\nof sun-spot change is attended by marked changes in many forms of\r\nsolar activity. The frequency of outbursts of eruptive prominences,\r\nthe brightness and form of the corona, magnetic storms and weather\r\nchanges on the earth are all closely associated with the sun-spot\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this sun-spot cycle, with all the attendant changes\r\nin the general solar activity, and the source of the apparently\r\nlimitless supply of solar energy still remain the two chief unsolved\r\nsecrets of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nOur sun is but a star traveling through the universe. It is\r\naccompanied in its journey to unknown parts of space, that lie in\r\nthe general direction of the constellation Hercules, by an extensive\r\nfamily of minor bodies consisting of the eight planets and their\r\nencircling moons, one thousand or more asteroids, numerous comets,\r\nand meteors without number, all moving in prescribed paths around\r\ntheir ruler.\r\n\r\nThe most important members of the sun's family are the planets,\r\nMercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune,\r\nnamed in the order of their position outward from the sun. We hear\r\noccasionally of the possibility of the existence of intra-Mercurial\r\nand trans-Neptunian planets and it is possible that some day an\r\nadditional planet may be discovered within the orbit of Mercury or\r\nbeyond the orbit of Neptune. The gravitational control of the sun\r\nextends far beyond the orbit of Neptune and there are reasons for\r\nbelieving in the existence of at least one or two additional planets\r\non the outskirts of the solar system. The existence of a planet\r\nwithin the orbit of Mercury is now, after long continued and diligent\r\nsearch, believed to be very doubtful.\r\n\r\nWere it possible to view the sun from the distance of the nearest\r\nstar with the aid of the greatest telescope on earth all the members\r\nof his family would be hopelessly invisible. So, also, we cannot\r\ntell as we point our powerful telescopes at the stars whether these\r\nother suns are attended by planet families. We may only argue that it\r\nis very unlikely that there should be only one star among hundreds\r\nof millions that is attended by a group of comparatively small dark\r\nbodies that shine by the reflected light from the star they encircle.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the two planets, Mercury and Venus, which are\r\nknown as the inferior planets, since their paths lie between the\r\nearth and the sun, all the planets have moons or satellites of their\r\nown that encircle the planet just as the planet encircles the sun.\r\n\r\nOur planet earth has one satellite, the moon, that has the\r\ndistinction of being the largest of all the moons in proportion to\r\nthe size of the planet it encircles. Jupiter and Saturn have moons\r\nthat surpass our moon in actual size; in fact, two of the moons\r\nof the outer planets are actually larger than the smallest planet\r\nMercury, but they are very small in proportion to the size of the\r\nplanets around which they revolve. Mars, the next planet beyond the\r\nearth, the nearest of the superior or outer planets, has two tiny\r\nmoons that bear the names of Deimos and Phobos, respectively. They\r\nare both less than twenty miles in diameter and revolve very near\r\nto the surface of Mars. They can only be seen with the aid of very\r\npowerful telescopes. The inner moon, Phobos, is unique in the solar\r\nsystem for it makes three trips around Mars while the planet is\r\nturning once on its axis.\r\n\r\nJupiter, the next planet outward from the sun, is almost a sun itself\r\nto its extensive family of nine moons. Four of these moons were first\r\nseen about three hundred years ago when Galileo pointed his first\r\ncrude telescope at the heavens and any one can now see them with the\r\naid of an opera glass. One of the four is equal in size to our own\r\nmoon; the others surpass it in size. These moons are most interesting\r\nlittle bodies to observe. Their eclipses in the shadow of Jupiter,\r\noccultations or disappearances behind his disk, and the transits of\r\nthe shadows as well as the moons themselves across the face of the\r\nplanet can be easily seen even with the smallest telescope. The five\r\nremaining moons have all been discovered in modern times. They are\r\nextremely small bodies visible only in large telescopes. Satellite\r\nV is the nearest of all the moons to Jupiter. The other four are at\r\ngreat distances from the planet.\r\n\r\nThe planet Saturn has nine moons. Titan, the largest, is nearly\r\nequal in size to Jupiter's largest moon, and is larger than Mercury;\r\nfour of the other moons have diameters between one thousand and two\r\nthousand miles in length. Since Saturn is nearly twice as far from\r\nthe sun as Jupiter his moons are more difficult to observe, though\r\nthe two largest are visible in small telescopes.\r\n\r\nSaturn is unique in the solar system in possessing in addition to\r\nhis nine satellites a most wonderful ring system, composed of swarms\r\nof minute moonlets, each pursuing its individual path around the\r\nplanet. It is this unusual ring system that makes Saturn the most\r\ninteresting to observe telescopically of all the planets.\r\n\r\nThe planet Uranus has four satellites and Neptune one. These planets\r\nand their satellites cannot be well observed on account of their\r\ngreat distances from the earth. The indistinctness of surface\r\nmarkings makes it impossible to determine the period of rotation of\r\nthese two outer planets on their axes. It is believed that their\r\nrotation is very rapid, however, as is the case with the other\r\nplanets Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n\r\nAll the planets in the solar system fall naturally into two groups.\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, the members of the outer group,\r\nhave on the average, diameters ten times as great and, therefore,\r\nvolumes one thousand times as great as Mercury, Venus, Earth and\r\nMars, the members of the inner or terrestrial group.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A. VENUS. B. MARS. C. JUPITER. D. SATURN.\r\n  Taken by Prof. E. E. Barnard with the 40-inch telescope of the Yerkes\r\n  Observatory, with exception of Saturn, which was taken by Prof.\r\n  Barnard on Mt. Wilson.]\r\n\r\n  NOTE: The reader must bear in mind that the telescopic views of\r\n  the four planets have not been reduced to the same scale and so\r\n  are not to be compared in size.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial planets are the pigmies of the solar system, the\r\nouter planets are the giants. The densities of the planets Mercury,\r\nVenus, Earth and Mars are several times greater than the density\r\nof water. They are all extremely heavy bodies for their size, and\r\nprobably have rigid interiors with surface crusts.\r\n\r\nThe existence of life on Mercury is made impossible by the absence\r\nof an atmosphere. Venus and Mars both have atmospheres and it is\r\npossible that both of these planets may support life. Mars has\r\nprobably been the most discussed of all the planets, though Venus is\r\nthe Earth's twin planet in size, mass, density and surface gravity,\r\njust as Uranus and Neptune are the twins of the outer group. It\r\nis now believed that water and vegetation exist on Mars. The reddish\r\ncolor of this planet is supposed to be due to its extensive desert\r\ntracts. The nature of certain peculiar markings on this planet, known\r\nas canals, still continues to be a matter of dispute. It is generally\r\nbelieved since air, water and vegetation exist on Mars, that some\r\nform of animal life also exists there.\r\n\r\nThe length of the day on Mars is known very accurately, for the\r\nrareness of its atmosphere permits us to see readily many of its\r\nsurface markings. The length of the day is about twenty-four and\r\none-half hours, and the seasonal changes on Mars strongly resemble\r\nour own, though the seasons on Mars are twice as long as they are\r\non our own planet since the Martian year is twice as long as the\r\nterrestrial year.\r\n\r\nThe question of life on Venus depends largely upon the length of the\r\nplanet's rotation period. This is still uncertain since no definite\r\nsurface markings can be found on the planet by which the period of\r\nits rotation can be determined. So dense is the atmosphere of Venus\r\nthat its surface is, apparently, always hidden from view beneath a\r\ncanopy of clouds. It is the more general belief that Venus, as well\r\nas Mercury, rotates on its axis in the same time that it takes to\r\nmake a revolution around the sun. In this case the same side of the\r\nplanet is always turned toward the sun and, as a result, the surface\r\nis divided into two hemispheres--one of perpetual day, the other of\r\nperpetual night.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar form of rotation in which the period of rotation and\r\nrevolution are equal is by no means unknown in the solar system. Our\r\nown moon always keeps the same face turned toward the earth and there\r\nare reasons for believing that some of the satellites of Jupiter and\r\nSaturn rotate in the same manner.\r\n\r\nLife on any one of the outer planets is impossible. The density of\r\nthese planets averages about the same as the density of the sun,\r\nwhich is a little higher than the density of water. The density of\r\nSaturn is even less than water. In other words, Saturn would float\r\nin water and it is the lightest of all the planets. It is assumed\r\nfrom these facts that the four outer planets are largely in a gaseous\r\ncondition. They all possess dense atmospheres and, in spite of their\r\nhuge size, rotate on their axis with great rapidity. The two whose\r\nrotation periods are known, Jupiter and Saturn, turn on their axis in\r\nabout ten hours. On account of this rapid rotation and their gaseous\r\ncondition both Jupiter and Saturn are noticeably flattened at the\r\npoles.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial planets are separated from the outer group by a wide\r\ngap. Within this space are to be found the asteroid or planetoid\r\ngroup. There are known to be over nine hundred and fifty of these\r\nminor bodies whose diameters range from five hundred miles for the\r\nlargest to three or four miles for the smallest. There are only four\r\nasteroids whose diameters exceed one hundred miles and the majority\r\nhave diameters of less than twenty miles. The total mass of the\r\nasteroids is much less than that of the smallest of the planets. It\r\nwas believed at one time that these small bodies were fragments of a\r\nshattered planet, but this view is no longer held. The asteroids as\r\nwell as the comets and meteors probably represent the material of the\r\nprimitive solar nebula that was not swept up when the larger planets\r\nwere formed.\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions the asteroids are only to be seen in large\r\ntelescopes and then only as star-like points of light. Most of them\r\nare simply huge rocks and all are necessarily devoid of life since\r\nsuch small bodies have not sufficient gravitational force to hold an\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of the planets around the sun and of the satellites\r\nof the planets around the primary planets are performed according to\r\nknown laws of motion that make it possible to foretell the positions\r\nof these bodies years in advance. Asteroids and comets also obey\r\nthese same laws, and after three observations of the positions of\r\none of these bodies have been obtained its future movements can be\r\npredicted. All the planets and their satellites are nearly perfect\r\nspheres. They all, with few exceptions, rotate on their axes and\r\nrevolve around the sun, or, in the case of moons, around their\r\nprimaries, in the same direction, from west to east. Only the two\r\noutermost satellites of Jupiter, the outermost satellites of Saturn\r\nand the satellites of Uranus and Neptune retrograde or travel in\r\ntheir orbits from east to west, which is opposite to the direction of\r\nmotion of all the other planets and satellites.\r\n\r\nThe paths of all the planets around the sun are ellipses that are\r\nnearly circular, and they all lie nearly in the same plane. The\r\nasteroids have orbits that are more flattened or elliptical and these\r\norbits are in some instances highly inclined to the planetary orbits.\r\nThe comets have orbits that are usually very elongated ellipses or\r\nparabolas. Some of the comets may be only chance visitors to our\r\nsolar system, though astronomers generally believe that they are all\r\npermanent members. Paths of comets pass around the sun at all angles\r\nand some comets move in their orbits from west to east, while others\r\nmove in the opposite direction or retrograde. The behavior of the\r\nasteroids and comets is not at all in accord with the theory that\r\nwas, until recently, universally advanced to explain the origin of\r\nthe solar system.\r\n\r\nSome astronomers have made attempts to modify the nebular hypothesis\r\nthat has held sway for so many years, in order to make it fit in with\r\nmore recent discoveries, but others feel that a new theory is now\r\nrequired to explain the origin of the solar system. Several theories\r\nhave been advanced but no new theory has yet definitely replaced the\r\nfamous nebular hypothesis of the noted French astronomer La Place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to consider the question of the origin of the\r\nearth apart from the question of the origin of the solar system.\r\nThat all the planets, as well as the asteroids, originated from a\r\ncommon parent-mass has never been seriously questioned. All of these\r\nbodies revolve about the sun, and rotate upon their axes in the same\r\ndirection--from west to east. Moreover, all of the planetary orbits\r\nlie very nearly in the same plane and are nearly circular in form.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of the asteroids are more elliptical and more highly\r\ninclined to one another than are the orbits of the planets, but on\r\nthe average they are neither very elliptical nor very highly inclined\r\nto the planetary orbits.\r\n\r\nThe sun rotates upon its axis in the same direction in which the\r\nplanets rotate and perform their revolutions, and the orbits of\r\nthe planets are inclined at small angles to the plane of the sun's\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nThese facts are all significant and cannot be overlooked in\r\nformulating a theory to explain the origin of the planetary system in\r\ngeneral and of the earth in particular. Presumably the planets and\r\nasteroids formed at one time a part of a central body which rotated\r\non its axis in the direction in which they now revolve about the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen and by the operation of what force, external or internal, they\r\nwere separated from this central body is the question.\r\n\r\nIn 1796 La Place advanced his celebrated _nebular hypothesis_ to\r\nexplain the origin of the solar system. It was received with favor\r\nboth by scientists and laymen, and in a short time was almost\r\nuniversally accepted as closely approximating to the truth.\r\n\r\nAccording to the nebular hypothesis the solar nebula from which the\r\nplanetary system was formed, originally extended at least as far as\r\nthe orbit of Neptune and rotated slowly in the direction in which\r\nthe planets now revolve. As it lost heat by radiation and contracted\r\nunder the gravitation of its parts its rate of rotation increased.\r\nWhen the centrifugal (center-fleeing) force at the equator equalled\r\nthe gravitational force directed toward the center, a ring would\r\nbe left behind by the contracting nebula. Such a ring would not be\r\nabsolutely uniform and would break at some point and gather into a\r\nplanetary mass under the gravitation of its parts. This planetary\r\nmass would abandon rings in turn and these would break up to form\r\nsatellites. Successive rings were supposed to have been abandoned at\r\nintervals by the solar nebula at the present distances of the planets\r\nfrom the sun in the manner described above until the original solar\r\nnebula had contracted to its present size.\r\n\r\nThe rings of Saturn were supposed to be the single example remaining\r\nof this process of forming planets and satellites from a _contracting\r\nnebulous mass_.\r\n\r\nThe La Placian hypothesis attempted to explain why all the planets\r\nand their satellites revolve in the same direction in which the sun\r\nturns on its axis, in nearly circular orbits and nearly in the same\r\nplane. At the time it was advanced it appeared to be in accord with\r\nall the facts then known regarding the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe planetoids with their interlacing and in some instances highly\r\ninclined and elliptical orbits were then undiscovered. It would have\r\nbeen impossible for them to have been formed by the abandonment of\r\nsuccessive rings from a central, rotating mass.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Saturn's rings was unknown at this time; also\r\nthe fact that the moonlets of the inner ring revolve about Saturn in\r\n_half_ the time required for the planet to turn on its axis--another\r\nimpossibility under the nebular hypothesis, for, according to the\r\nassumptions of the nebular hypothesis it would be impossible for a\r\nsatellite to revolve about a central body in a shorter time than that\r\nbody turns on its axis.\r\n\r\nThe satellites of Mars were not discovered until many years later,\r\nas well as the retrograding satellites of Jupiter and Saturn,\r\nall presenting difficulties in the way of accepting the nebular\r\nhypothesis without radical changes. Attempts, mostly unsuccessful,\r\nhave been made from time to time to make these exceptional cases fit\r\nin with the requirements of the nebular hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the sun's heat was maintained by the contraction of\r\nthe original solar nebula, which would cause its temperature to rise,\r\nappeared to give considerable support to the theory of La Place, but\r\nthe mathematicians got to work and showed that the amount of heat\r\nthat would be furnished by the contraction of the sun from beyond\r\nthe orbit of Neptune to its present dimensions would be sufficient\r\nto supply heat to the earth at the present rate for only twenty-five\r\nmillion years, a period far too brief, the geologists and biologists\r\nsaid, to cover all the vast cyclical changes that are known to have\r\ntaken place upon the surface of this planet since its surface crust\r\nwas formed. Evidently gravitational contraction is by no means the\r\nonly or even the chief source of the sun's heat.\r\n\r\nIt was also shown indisputably, that it would have been impossible\r\nfor successive rings to have been abandoned at certain definite\r\nintervals by a contracting nebula, and granted a ring could have\r\nbeen formed it would have been impossible for it to condense into a\r\nplanet, since forces residing in the sun would offset the gravitation\r\nof its parts.\r\n\r\nWhen La Place advanced his famous theory it was, to use his own\r\nwords, \"with that distrust which everything ought to inspire that is\r\nnot a result of observation or of calculation.\"\r\n\r\nWere La Place living today he would be, we believe, the first to\r\nabandon a theory that is now known to be in accord neither with\r\nobservation nor calculation.\r\n\r\nDeprived of a theory that has served to explain the outstanding\r\nfeatures of the solar system more or less adequately for one hundred\r\nand twenty-five years, astronomers are seeking in the light of recent\r\nobservations and discoveries to formulate a satisfactory theory of\r\nthe origin of the solar system.\r\n\r\nIn the planetesimal theory of Chamberlin and Moulton and the recently\r\nsuggested theory of the well-known English mathematician, Jeans, _a\r\nsecond sun passing close to our own sun is assumed to have been the\r\ncause of the origin of the planetary system_.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the close approach of such a sun would be the\r\nejection of a stream of matter from our sun, as we term it, in the\r\ndirection of the passing body and also in a diametrically opposite\r\ndirection. This ejection would be continuous as long as the stars\r\nremained near one another, the height attained by the ejected stream\r\ndecreasing as the passing star receded. The result would be the\r\nformation of a _spiral nebula_ in which the motion of the ejected\r\nparticles--planetesimals--would be across the spiral arms, toward\r\nand away from the passing star. After the sun had receded so far as\r\nto have no further effect upon these ejected particles they would\r\nrevolve about the sun in more or less elliptical orbits which would\r\ngradually be reduced to nearly circular forms by repeated collisions\r\nbetween planetesimals. Larger nuclei would be formed and these would\r\ngradually sweep up smaller fragments and become the planets of the\r\npresent system. Smaller nuclei in the vicinity of larger ones would\r\nbecome their satellites and in the course of many millions of years\r\nall of the larger fragments would be swept up by the planetary nuclei\r\nand their satellites--leaving only the asteroids, comets and meteors\r\nas survivors of the original spiral system.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that a spiral nebula formed by the close\r\napproach of two suns would resemble in form only the great spiral\r\nnebulæ that are known to exist by hundreds of thousands in the\r\nheavens. These are far too extensive to form anything so small as a\r\nsingle solar system, but might condense into systems composed of many\r\nsuns--either galaxies or star clusters.\r\n\r\nJean's suggested theory of the origin of the planetary system differs\r\nin its details from the above, though a passing sun is assumed to\r\nbe the disturbing force that causes the ejection of a stream of\r\nmatter which condenses to form the planets and their satellites. The\r\norigin of the inner planets is left greatly in doubt by this theory,\r\nhowever, and the system which interests us chiefly--the earth-moon\r\nsystem--is the one about which it is most difficult to arrive at any\r\ndefinite conclusion. Our own sun, it is assumed, was dark and cold,\r\nof low density and with a diameter about equal to that of Neptune's\r\norbit at the time of the catastrophe which is placed at some\r\n300,000,000 years ago. In Jean's words, \"... The time for arriving\r\nat conclusions in cosmogony has not yet come--and it must be left to\r\nfuture investigators armed with more mathematical and observational\r\nknowledge than we at present possess to pronounce a final decision.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, since La Place advanced his celebrated nebular hypothesis,\r\ngreat advances in astronomy have been made, and man is in a better\r\nposition to theorize on this fascinating problem today than he was\r\none hundred and twenty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nAll such theories must necessarily be regarded as working hypotheses\r\nonly, to be discarded or modified as our knowledge and understanding\r\nof the laws of the universe increase. No theory can ever be regarded\r\nas final or perfect.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of radio-activity furnishes us with new material\r\nfor new theories. The sun and the planets may be and probably are\r\nfar older than we ever dreamed could be possible. It is no longer\r\nnecessary or reasonable to assume that a greatly extended solar\r\nnebula once existed and supplied the planets with heat through\r\ngravitational contraction or to place a time limit upon the period\r\nrequired for the formation of the planets and their satellites that\r\nis not in accord with the requirements of other sciences.\r\n\r\nWe know today that there exist within the sun powerful repulsive\r\nforces, which even under present conditions occasionally eject\r\ngaseous matter to heights of five hundred thousand miles or more with\r\na velocity of over two hundred miles per second. Small changes in the\r\nvelocity of ejection produce great differences in the height of the\r\nejected columns.\r\n\r\nWith an initial velocity of three hundred and eighty miles per\r\nsecond, matter would be thrown from the solar surface to a height\r\nof fifty million miles. Were the velocity of ejection three hundred\r\nand eighty-three miles per second the height of the column would be\r\nfive hundred million miles, while a further increase in the initial\r\nvelocity would send matter away from the sun, never to return.\r\n\r\nInstead of suns and solar systems evolved from nebulæ we are now\r\nmore familiar with the idea of nebulæ evolved from stars through some\r\nterrific cataclysm as in the case of novas or temporary stars.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that there exist in certain parts of space a number\r\nof sharply defined stars surrounded by extensive nebulous envelopes.\r\nAre these possibly suns that are going through the process of forming\r\ntheir planetary systems?\r\n\r\nIt is now known that pressure of light and electrical repulsion are\r\nforces to be reckoned with in the evolution of stars and nebulæ as\r\nwell as gravitational contraction. It has long been felt that the\r\npeculiar formations existing among the vast irregular gaseous nebulæ\r\ncould not be explained as gravitational effects alone.\r\n\r\n_Light-pressure and electrical repulsion_, as well as _gravitation_\r\nare at work within the solar system and the sun is the seat of\r\npowerful disturbances which produce periodic outbursts of exceptional\r\nactivity and which may have produced in the distant past more\r\nstartling effects than any with which we are familiar at present.\r\n\r\nThe earth and moon form a system that is in a way unique. No\r\nsatellite in the solar system is so large in proportion to its\r\nprimary as is our own moon. Seen from the distance of Venus or Mars,\r\nthe two bodies would apparently form a _double star_. The diameter of\r\nthe moon is one-fourth that of the earth. Satellite III of Jupiter\r\nfar exceeds our own moon in actual size but its diameter is only\r\nabout four-hundredths of the diameter of the planet about which\r\nit revolves. The diameter of Titan, the largest satellite of the\r\nSaturnian system, bears the same ratio to the diameter of Saturn.\r\nMoreover, all the nearer satellites of Jupiter and Saturn lie nearly\r\nin the equatorial planes of these planets, but the orbit of the moon\r\nis inclined at a high angle to the plane of the earth's equator.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to believe that the satellites of Jupiter or\r\nSaturn were at some time thrown off from the equatorial belts of\r\ntheir primaries, just as the planets themselves may have been ejected\r\nfrom the equatorial belt of the sun, but we cannot so readily believe\r\nthat our own satellite was formed from the earth in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThe moon's orbit lies nearly in the plane of the sun's equator,\r\nhowever, and it is conceivable that both earth and moon were\r\nsimultaneously ejected from the equatorial zone of the sun, the two\r\nnuclei being so close together that the smaller one remained under\r\nthe gravitational control of the larger.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in the way of believing that the moon once formed\r\na part of the earth are very great. It can be shown mathematically\r\nthat if the two bodies at one time formed a single mass it would have\r\nbeen impossible for the moon to break away from the earth, unless the\r\nforce that caused the separation were sufficient to hurl the moon to\r\na greater distance than two and a half times the earth's radius. The\r\nmathematician, Roche, found out by computation that a satellite could\r\nnot remain intact within this distance of the planet, but would be\r\nbroken up into small fragments under the effects of the tides raised\r\nby the larger body. If, then, the moon had originally been ejected\r\nfrom the earth to a less distance than two and one-half radii of the\r\nearth (2.44 to be exact) it would have been disintegrated into small\r\nparticles, or moonlets, under the tidal strains exerted upon it by\r\nthe earth and would have been gradually distributed about the earth\r\nin the form of a meteoric ring which, in the course of ages, would be\r\nabsorbed by the earth, just as Saturn is now gradually absorbing its\r\nrings.\r\n\r\nThe planets differ greatly in density. The more distant and larger\r\nplanets--Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune--have densities\r\nequal to or less than that of the sun. The densities of the inner\r\nplanets--Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars--are, relatively, extremely\r\nhigh, the density of the Earth's core being about that of meteoric\r\niron. The densities of Mercury and Venus are slightly less than that\r\nof the earth and the densities of Mars and the moon about equal to\r\nthat of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nIf a stream of matter were ejected from the sun under the influence\r\nof some external force, such as that exerted by a passing star, the\r\noutlying parts of the stream would consist of the lighter elements\r\nand the lower parts of the heavier elements, since the lighter solar\r\nelements lie at or near the surface of the sun and the heavier\r\nelements at greater depths. At the time of ejection the lighter\r\nelements would be thrown to great distances and would go to form the\r\nless dense outer planets; the heavier elements would go to form the\r\ninner planets of high density.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that ejection of solar material might have taken\r\nplace under the influence of certain forces at work within the sun\r\nitself, such as electrical repulsion or pressure of light which might\r\nbecome powerful enough under certain conditions to overcome the\r\neffect of gravitation.\r\n\r\nNext to nothing is known about the physical state of matter at great\r\nsolar depths, where abnormal conditions of temperature and pressure\r\nmust exist, and where great physical changes and disturbances may\r\nhave taken place in the past. Even today solar activity goes through\r\na cycle of change during the sun-spot period, and many millions of\r\nyears ago the sun-spot cycle of solar activity may have been far\r\ndifferent from what it is today and a far more powerful factor in\r\nproducing changes in the solar system.\r\n\r\nOutbursts of novas indicate that agencies making for peace and\r\norder are not the only ones at work among the stars. The cause of\r\nsuch outbursts has never been satisfactorily explained. The theory\r\nthat they are caused by the close approach of two suns or by the\r\nencounter of a star with a dark nebula does not account for all of\r\nthe circumstances of such outbursts. The nebulous matter seen about\r\na nova after the outburst is now generally believed to have been\r\nexpelled from the star itself at the time of the catastrophe and may\r\nconceivably be the stuff of which planetary systems are made.\r\n\r\nAt some epoch in the past, probably at least one thousand million\r\nyears ago, our own sun may have undergone some cataclysmic change\r\nand this may, conceivably, have been brought about by disturbances\r\nwithin the sun itself. Elements may have been so formed and\r\ndistributed within the interior of the sun that friction and internal\r\ninstability resulted and in time produced an upheaval of solar\r\nelements with initial velocities so great that, possibly, through\r\nelectrical repulsion and light-pressure, portions of the ejected\r\nstreams were permanently detached from the sun and became the nuclei\r\nof future planets. In some such way, it is conceivable, our own\r\nplanet Earth and the other members of our solar system may have been\r\nbrought into existence in the dim and distant past--many hundred\r\nmillion years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nJUPITER AND HIS NINE MOONS\r\n\r\n\r\nJupiter shines by reflected sunlight with a brilliancy that usually\r\nexceeds that of the brightest of the stars, Sirius. When seen during\r\nthe midnight hours the remarkable unflickering brightness of this\r\nlargest and most distinguished member of the solar system at once\r\nserves to set it apart from the scintillating stars far beyond.\r\n\r\nThere is but one planet, Venus, that always surpasses Jupiter in\r\nbrilliancy, though Mars on the occasions of its close approaches\r\nto the earth may equal or slightly surpass Jupiter in brightness.\r\nAs Venus never departs more than forty-eight degrees from the sun,\r\nand so is never seen in the midnight hours, Jupiter usually shines\r\nwithout a rival when visible at midnight. To one who has observed the\r\ntwo planets together the silvery radiance and surpassing brilliancy\r\nof Venus, due not to its size, but to its comparative nearness to\r\nthe earth, at once serves to distinguish it from the golden glow of\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nEven the smallest telescopes of two- or three-inch aperture will show\r\nthe four historic moons of Jupiter which were the first celestial\r\nobjects to be discovered when Galileo turned his crude telescope to\r\nthe heavens in the year 1610.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these tiny points of light were actually revolving\r\naround the great planet was soon detected by the famous astronomer\r\nand we can imagine with what breathless interest he observed these\r\nsatellites of another world whose discovery dealt such a severe blow\r\nto the old Ptolemaic theory that the earth was the center of the\r\nuniverse. It was not until the great telescopes of modern times were\r\ninvented that the five additional moons of Jupiter were discovered.\r\nThe four satellites first observed by Galileo were fancifully named\r\nIo, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, in the order of their positions\r\noutward from the planet, but these names are rarely used now, the\r\nsatellites being designated for convenience I, II, III and IV,\r\nrespectively. The first of the new satellites to be discovered was\r\nSatellite V, which is the nearest to Jupiter of all the nine moons.\r\nIt is an extremely small body, not more than one hundred miles in\r\ndiameter, and to discover this tiny body as it skirted rapidly around\r\nthe great planet within sixty-seven thousand miles of its surface,\r\nnearly lost in the glaring rays, was a difficult feat even for an\r\nexperienced observer. It was accomplished, however, by Prof. E.\r\nE. Barnard with the great Lick refractor in 1892. Satellite V is\r\nhopelessly beyond the reach of any but the greatest telescopes, as\r\nare also the four satellites discovered since that date. In fact,\r\nmost of these tiny moons are observed photographically. Satellites VI\r\nand VII were discovered photographically in 1905. They are both about\r\nseven million miles from the planet and their paths loop through\r\none another; they are, moreover, highly inclined to each other at\r\nan angle of nearly thirty degrees. When nearest together they are\r\nseparated by a distance of two million miles. Two more extremely\r\nsmall bodies, known as Satellites VIII and IX, have been discovered\r\nsince then, one at Greenwich, England, in 1908, the other at the Lick\r\nObservatory in 1914. These excessively faint bodies are the most\r\nremote satellites of Jupiter and they are of particular interest\r\nbecause they travel around the planet in a retrograde direction, or\r\nfrom east to west, which is _opposite_ to the direction of revolution\r\nprevailing in the solar system. The ninth and most distant satellite\r\nof Saturn also retrogrades, or revolves in a clockwise rather than\r\na counter-clockwise direction around the planet. One explanation\r\ngiven for this peculiarity of the outermost satellites of Jupiter\r\nand Saturn is that this backward revolution around the planet is\r\nmore stable when the satellites are at great distances from the\r\nprimary, and the gravitational control that the planet exerts is\r\ntherefore weak. The moons of the planets are, of course, subject\r\nto the attraction of the sun as well as to the attraction of the\r\ncontrolling planet, and the greater the distance of the satellite\r\nfrom the planet the stronger the pull exerted by the sun and the\r\nweaker the bonds that bind the moon to the planet. Beyond a certain\r\nlimit it would be impossible for the planet to hold the satellite\r\nagainst the sun's greater attraction and the satellite would leave\r\nthe planet to revolve directly around the sun, thereby becoming a\r\nplanet. It appears that as this danger limit is neared it is safer\r\nfor the satellite to \"back\" around the planet than to follow the\r\nusual \"west to east\" direction of revolution. The eighth satellite\r\nof Jupiter is more than fourteen million and the ninth more than\r\nfifteen million miles from the parent planet and they require about\r\ntwo years and three years, respectively, to complete one trip around\r\nJupiter. When we consider that Satellite V darts around the planet\r\nin less than twelve hours at a distance of only sixty-seven thousand\r\nmiles from its surface we realise what tremendous differences exist\r\nin the distances and periods of revolution of the nine moons. There\r\nis also great disparity in the sizes of the various moons. The five\r\nmoons discovered in modern times are all excessively faint and\r\nextremely small. The diameter of the largest of these, Satellite\r\nV, is less than one hundred miles. On the other hand, the four\r\nhistoric moons of Jupiter are of planetary dimensions. The smallest,\r\nSatellite II, is slightly larger than our own moon, while the\r\nlargest, Satellite III, has a diameter, according to measurements\r\nmade with the 40-inch Yerkes refractor in 1916, of three thousand\r\nnine hundred and eight miles, which is only four hundred miles less\r\nthan the diameter of Mars. The periods of revolution of these four\r\nsatellites range from one day and eighteen hours for the nearest,\r\nwhich is about two hundred and sixty-one thousand miles from the\r\ncenter of Jupiter, to sixteen days and sixteen and one-half hours for\r\nthe most distant, which is more than one million one hundred and\r\nsixty thousand miles from the planet. These four moons are so near\r\nto the great planet that they are continually dipping into his huge\r\nshadow and experiencing an eclipse of the sun which, owing to the\r\nnearness and great size of Jupiter, lasts for two or three hours. At\r\ntimes of eclipse the moon suddenly disappears from the observer's\r\nview, though it may be considerably to one side of the planet. Its\r\nreappearance later on is just as sudden, or it may pass out of the\r\nshadow while hidden from us behind the disk of the planet, in which\r\ncase its reappearance is invisible from the earth. The occultations\r\nof the satellites, or, in other words, their disappearance behind\r\nthe planet's disk, are also interesting phenomena to observe, as\r\nare their \"transits\" across the disk of the planet as the satellite\r\npasses in front of it. Not only the satellite itself but its shadow\r\nas well can be seen, a small black dot passing over the surface of\r\nJupiter. The satellite is totally eclipsing the sun for this small\r\ndark portion of the planet's disk. Two satellites and their shadows\r\nare frequently seen crossing the face of the planet at the same\r\ntime. It is possible to observe all the phenomena of the satellite's\r\ntransits and shadows, eclipses and occultations with very small\r\ntelescopes. From observations of the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites\r\nthe important discovery of the finite velocity of light was first\r\nmade as far back as the year 1675.\r\n\r\nFaint surface markings have been made out at certain times on the\r\nlargest of the four satellites, Satellite III, and also on Satellite\r\nI. Observations of the markings on the former seem to indicate that\r\nit always keeps the same face turned toward Jupiter as does our own\r\nmoon toward the earth.\r\n\r\nThere are also reasons for believing that the equatorial regions of\r\nSatellite I are light colored and the polar regions dark. There is\r\nthe possibility that forms of life may exist on these satellites of\r\nJupiter, though they are more likely barren, lifeless worlds, such as\r\nMercury and the moon. Their great distance from the earth, never less\r\nthan three hundred and sixty-eight million miles, makes observations\r\nof their surface markings very difficult.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful beyond description must the heavens appear as viewed\r\nfrom the satellites of Jupiter! Viewed from the distance of Io, or\r\nSatellite I, the mighty planet Jupiter presents a spectacle such\r\nas the eye of man has never been privileged to behold. The huge\r\nflattened globe, ninety thousand miles in equatorial diameter, equal\r\nin mass to _three hundred planets such as our own_ and in volume to\r\nnearly _fourteen hundred_, fills a space in the heavens nearly twenty\r\ndegrees in extent as viewed from this satellite. Fifteen hundred of\r\nour own full moons would hardly fill the same space. Whirling on its\r\naxis with frightful speed in a period of less than ten hours, the\r\nhuge ball glides rapidly but majestically onward through the sky. A\r\nfar distant sun shrunk to but one-fifth the diameter of the full moon\r\nthrows light and shade across the rapidly changing surface of the\r\nplanet, rich in the reds, browns and yellows and all the gorgeous\r\nshades and tints of its dense, seething, gaseous envelope. The phases\r\nof the moon on a greatly enlarged scale rapidly succeed each other\r\non Jupiter as it is viewed from the satellite in all positions with\r\nreference to the sun. The cause of the belts of Jupiter, that lie\r\nparallel to the planet's equator and are constantly changing in\r\nnumber, width and shade, as well as the nature of all the peculiar\r\nsplashes of color and intensely white flecks that come and go in\r\nthe dense atmosphere of the planet would not be such a mystery to\r\nus were it possible to view the great planet from the distance of\r\nSatellite I, which is about as far from the surface of Jupiter as\r\nthe moon is from the earth. It is uncertain whether the planet is\r\nentirely gaseous throughout or has a central core of solid or liquid\r\nmatter. Its density is only one and one-quarter times that of water\r\nand slightly less than that of the sun, showing that it is composed\r\nlargely, if not entirely, of matter in a gaseous state. Jupiter is a\r\nworld as different from our own as it is possible to imagine. There\r\nis no visible surface crust and there are no permanent markings.\r\nDifferent spots on the planet's disk give different periods of\r\nrotation showing that it is atmospheric phenomena that we observe.\r\nAll is constant flux and change on Jupiter. Dense vapors arise\r\nfrom a highly heated interior and spread out into belts parallel\r\nto the equator in the direction of the planet's rotation. From its\r\nnearest satellite all the interesting changes of color and form that\r\nconstantly take place in the atmosphere of this great globe could be\r\nobserved in great detail. The high percentage of light and heat that\r\nJupiter reflects from the sun to its nearer satellites makes it a\r\nsecondary sun to them of tremendous size though feeble strength.\r\n\r\nAs seen from Satellite I the other three major moons of Jupiter\r\npresent all the phases of our own moon in rapid succession, due to\r\ntheir constantly changing positions with reference to the sun. The\r\nfive small moons, discovered in modern times, are so minute that they\r\nare simply star-like points of light even when viewed from the other\r\nmoons of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nTo keep track of the rapidly changing positions and various phases\r\nof the moons of Jupiter as seen from any one of them, as well as\r\nthe rapid _apparent_ motion of the planet through the sky due to\r\nthe revolutions of the satellite around the planet, would be a\r\ntroublesome task for an astronomer stationed on one of these far\r\ndistant worlds. It would be a common sight to see in the sky at one\r\ntime the huge planet, the far-distant, shrunken sun, and one, two\r\nor three moons. Seen from the moons of Jupiter the constellations\r\nwould appear as they do to us on earth, for such a slight change in\r\nposition as five hundred million miles, more or less, is trivial\r\nwhen one is looking at the stars. Observations of the stars from the\r\nnearest moon of Jupiter would be attended with great difficulties at\r\ntimes, since reflected sunlight from a body nearly twenty degrees in\r\ndiameter would be extremely troublesome, especially were the phases\r\nof the planets near that of the full moon. We know how the presence\r\nof our own moon in the heavens at the full dims the brightness of\r\nthe stars so that only the brightest stars are seen. Even as viewed\r\nfrom the fourth or most distant of the major satellites the planet\r\nsubtends an angle of nearly five degrees. Occultations of the stars\r\nare many and frequent as the huge planet globe glides swiftly through\r\nthe heavens. Many a moonlight night appears almost as day owing to\r\nthe presence of the enormous, brilliantly reflecting ball of light\r\nand at times two or three moons in addition. Only the brightest stars\r\ncould possibly be seen under such circumstances. When, however, the\r\nsmall worlds pass into the shadow of the great mother planet and not\r\nonly the light of the sun but also the reflected light of Jupiter\r\ndisappears for many minutes, the stars shine forth in all their glory\r\nthere as here. At such times some of the larger moons would usually\r\nbe seen shining by the reflected light of the far distant sun. Saturn\r\nalso would be visible as a magnificent star, but beautiful Venus and\r\nruddy Mars would fail to appear. Tiny bodies, mere specks of light at\r\nthis distance, they would be lost to view in the glare of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE RINGS AND MOONS OF SATURN\r\n\r\n\r\nNearly everyone has felt at some time or other a strong desire to\r\ngaze at some of the beauties and wonders of the heavens through\r\na telescope and the one object that all of us wish to see, if,\r\nperchance, this desire is to be gratified is Saturn, whose unusual\r\nring system has, so far as we know, no counterpart in the sky.\r\n\r\nAll the planets in the solar system with the exception of the two\r\ninnermost, Mercury and Venus, are attended by satellites, but Saturn,\r\nalone, has in addition to a family of nine moons, three distinct\r\nrings of great dimensions which are composed of swarms of minute\r\nparticles revolving around the planet.\r\n\r\nWhy Saturn should be the only planet to possess such a system of\r\nrings has never been explained in an entirely satisfactory manner.\r\nThere is an interesting law known as \"Roche's Law,\" however, named\r\nfrom its investigator, that states that no satellite of a planet can\r\nexist intact with 2.44 times the radius of the planet. This limit is\r\nspoken of as \"Roche's Limit\" and applying it to the planet Saturn we\r\nfind that the rings of Saturn fall within this limit. It does not\r\nnecessarily follow from this that the minute particles of which the\r\nrings are composed are the shattered remains of one small satellite,\r\nbut rather that they are the material from which a satellite might\r\nhave been formed were it not so close to the planet. Within \"Roche's\r\nLimit\" the mutual attraction of the various particles for each other\r\nthat would tend eventually to gather them into one body is overcome\r\nby tidal forces that arise from such close proximity to the huge\r\nplanet. The stress and strain of such forces is so great that no\r\ngrouping of particles can take place. This explains, possibly, why\r\nthe rings continue to exist in their present condition. The total\r\nquantity of matter in the rings is known to be very small, for\r\nit does not disturb the motions of any of the nearer and smaller\r\nsatellites, though tiny Mimas, six hundred miles in diameter, is only\r\nthirty-one thousand miles beyond the outer edge of the outer ring.\r\n\r\nAn interesting observation was made a few years ago of the passage\r\nof the rings of the planet between us and a star. Though the light\r\nof the star was diminished to one-fourth of its normal brightness\r\nwhen the rings passed before it, at no time was its light entirely\r\neclipsed by any of the particles. It was computed that if the\r\ndiameters of any of the individual particles had amounted to as much\r\nas three or four miles the star would have been temporarily eclipsed.\r\nAn upper limit for the size of the moonlets was thus obtained. The\r\naverage diameter of the particles is probably much less than three\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the ring system is not over fifty or one hundred\r\nmiles, but its total diameter is one hundred and seventy-two thousand\r\nmiles. There are, in all, three concentric rings. The faint inner\r\nring, known as the \"crape\" ring, is invisible in a telescope under\r\nfour inches in aperture. The width of this inner ring is eleven\r\nthousand miles. Just beyond the crape ring is the chief, bright\r\nring, eighteen thousand miles in width. It shades gradually in\r\nbrightness from its juncture with the crape ring to its most luminous\r\nportion at its outer edge, which is separated from the third or\r\nouter ring by a gap two thousand two hundred miles in width, known\r\nas Cassini's Division. The third or outer ring is eleven thousand\r\nmiles wide and is less bright than the central ring. The inner edge\r\nof the inner ring is but six thousand miles above the surface of the\r\nplanet. On account of the curvature of the planet the ring system\r\nis invisible from the north and south poles of Saturn. As in the\r\ncase of the satellites of a planet the inner particles of the rings\r\nrevolve around the planet more rapidly than the outer particles. The\r\ninnermost particles of the crape ring require but five hours for one\r\njourney around Saturn while the outermost particles of the outer ring\r\nrequire one hundred and thirty-seven hours, or nearly six days to\r\ncomplete one revolution.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the gap in the rings known as Cassini's Division\r\nseveral other fainter divisions exist. If a group of moonlets were\r\nto revolve around the planet in the positions marked by these gaps\r\ntheir periods of revolution would be commensurable with the periods\r\nof several of the satellites of Saturn. As a result the attraction\r\nexerted on such particles by these satellites would gradually disturb\r\ntheir motion in such a way as to draw them away from these positions.\r\nIt is owing, therefore, to the attraction of the satellites of Saturn\r\nfor the moonlets that these gaps in the rings exist.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the disturbances produced in the motion of the\r\nmoonlets by the satellites of Saturn collisions are bound to occur\r\noccasionally among the various particles. When two particles collide\r\nthe period of revolution of one or both of them is reduced and as a\r\nresult collisions tend to bring the moonlets gradually closer and\r\ncloser to the surface of the planet. The dusky inner ring, it is\r\nbelieved, may consist largely of particles whose periods have been\r\ncontinually shortened by collisions.\r\n\r\nSaturn may, therefore, lose its ring system in the course of time\r\nthrough its gradually being drawn down upon the planet by collisions\r\nof the various particles until all of the material is finally swept\r\nup by the planet. Such a change would probably require millions of\r\nyears, however, as collisions are probably, on the whole, infrequent.\r\nIt is possible that the ring system of Saturn may have been much more\r\nextensive in the past than it is now and other members of our solar\r\nsystem may have had such appendages in the far distant past.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the rings of Saturn as viewed from our planet\r\nchanges periodically as a result of the revolution of the earth\r\nand Saturn around the sun, which places them in constantly changing\r\npositions with reference to each other. The rings lie in the plane of\r\nSaturn's equator, which is inclined twenty-seven degrees to its orbit\r\nand twenty-eight degrees to the Earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nSince the position of the equator remains parallel to itself while\r\nthe planet is journeying around the sun it happens that half the time\r\nthe earth is elevated above the plane of the rings and the remainder\r\nof the time it lies below the plane of the rings. Twice in the period\r\nof Saturn's revolution around the sun, which occupies nearly thirty\r\nyears, the earth lies directly in the plane of the rings and at this\r\ntime the rings entirely disappear from view for a short time. Mid-way\r\nbetween the two dates of disappearance the rings are tilted at their\r\nwidest angle with reference to the earth and they are then seen to\r\nthe best advantage. As the date of their disappearance approaches\r\nthey appear more and more like a line of light extending to either\r\nside of the planet's equator. Even in the most powerful telescope\r\nthe rings entirely disappear from view for a few hours at the time\r\nthe earth lies exactly in the same plane. It is at this time that\r\nthe ball of the planet is best seen. Its flattening at the poles,\r\nwhich is nearly ten per cent. of its equatorial diameter then gives\r\nit a decidedly oval appearance. Ordinarily one of the hemispheres\r\nof Saturn is partly or entirely concealed by the rings so that the\r\noblate form is not so noticeable. It was the change in the tilt and\r\nvisibility of the rings that so perplexed Galileo when he attempted\r\nto make out the nature of these appendages of Saturn with his\r\ncrude telescope of insufficient magnifying power. So great was his\r\nbewilderment when the rings finally disappeared that he cried out in\r\ndespair that Saturn must have swallowed his children, according to\r\nthe legend. He finally became so exasperated with the results of his\r\nobservations that he gave up observing the planet. The true nature of\r\nthese appendages of Saturn remained a mystery until Huygens solved\r\nthe problem in 1655, some time after the death of Galileo.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rings, Saturn has nine satellites named, in the\r\norder of their distance outward from the planet, Mimas, Enceladus,\r\nTethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus and Phoebe. The\r\nlast-mentioned satellite was discovered by W. H. Pickering in 1899.\r\nIt aroused great interest at the time because it was the first\r\nsatellite to be discovered with \"retrograde\" motion in its orbit. Two\r\nsatellites of Jupiter since discovered revolve in the same direction\r\naround their primary.\r\n\r\nThe satellites of Saturn are approximate to those of Jupiter in\r\nsize and exactly equal them in number. The largest, Titan, is three\r\nthousand miles in diameter and can be easily seen with the smallest\r\ntelescopes. With a four-inch telescope five of the satellites can\r\nbe readily found, though they are not as interesting to observe as\r\nthe satellites of Jupiter because they are far more distant from\r\nthe earth. The time they require to make one journey around Saturn\r\nvaries from nearly twenty-three hours for Mimas, the nearest, to\r\napproximately five hundred and twenty-four days for Phoebe, the most\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nSaturn as well as Jupiter is marked by belts parallel to the Equator\r\nthough they appear more indistinct than those of Jupiter on account\r\nof the greater distance of Saturn. Saturn also resembles Jupiter\r\nin its physical composition which is largely, if not entirely,\r\ngaseous, and in the extremely short period of rotation on its axis\r\nwhich is approximately ten hours. In more ways than one Saturn is\r\na very unusual planet. In addition to possessing an enormous ring\r\nsystem it is the lightest of all the planets, its density being only\r\nsixty-three hundredths that of water, and it is the most oblate,\r\nits flattening at the poles amounting nearly to one-tenth of its\r\ndiameter. Its equator is more highly inclined to its orbit than is\r\nthe case with any other planet, not even excepting the earth and\r\nMars. For this reason its seasonal changes are very great, in marked\r\ncontrast to Jupiter whose equator lies very nearly in the plane of\r\nits orbit. Since Saturn is so far away from the sun that it receives\r\nonly one ninetieth as much light and heat per unit area as the earth,\r\nits outer gaseous surface must be extremely cold unless considerable\r\nheat is conveyed to the surface from within its hot interior.\r\n\r\nThe late Prof. Lowell concluded from certain observations made at\r\nFlagstaff, Ariz., that Saturn is composed of layers of different\r\ndensities and that the inner layers are more flattened at the poles\r\nand rotate faster than the outer layers. Marked variations in the\r\ncolor and brightness of the ball of the planet have been noted from\r\ntime to time. In 1916 observers of Saturn described the planet as\r\npinkish-brown and conspicuously darker than the brighter portions of\r\nthe rings.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that these very noticeable changes in the color and\r\nbrightness of Saturn are due to slight, irregular changes in the\r\nintensity of the radiations of the sun which set up certain secondary\r\neffects in the atmosphere of the planets. Similar changes in color\r\nand brightness have been observed also in the case of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nIS THE MOON A DEAD WORLD?\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been a generally accepted belief among astronomers for years\r\nthat the moon is a dead world devoid of air and water and so,\r\nnecessarily, lifeless. It is certain that the moon has no extensive\r\natmosphere such as envelops our own planet. There is abundant proof\r\nof this fact. The edge of the lunar disk is clear-cut. Whenever,\r\nas happens frequently, the moon passes between us and a star the\r\ndisappearance of the star is instantaneous. There is no gradual\r\ndimming or refraction of the star's light by atmospheric vapors.\r\nMoreover, lunar shadows are harsh and black. There is no evidence of\r\ndiffusion of light on the moon by atmospheric gases.\r\n\r\nThe absence of water or water vapor on the visible surface of the\r\nmoon, at least in any appreciable quantity, is plainly evident to\r\nanyone who observes the moon through the telescope. Even with small\r\ntelescopes, objects five miles or so in diameter can be readily\r\ndetected and clouds drifting over the surface could not possibly\r\nescape our observation if they existed.\r\n\r\nBodies of water, great or small, would be plainly visible and would\r\nbesides give rise to water vapor and clouds, which we would not fail\r\nto detect.\r\n\r\nSince the surface of the moon is unscreened by air and water vapor to\r\nabsorb the incoming rays from the sun, and the outgoing radiations\r\nfrom the surface, the extremes of temperature between day and night\r\nare very great, and are augmented by the fact that the lunar day\r\nequals the lunar month in length, so that fourteen days of untempered\r\nheat are followed by fourteen days of frigid darkness. Observations\r\nof the rate of radiation from the moon's surface during total\r\neclipses of the moon indicate that the moon's radiation is very\r\nrapid, and that its temperature during the height of the lunar day\r\nprobably approaches 200° F., while at the lunar midnight it may have\r\nfallen to 100° below zero F., or even lower.\r\n\r\nWith air and water both lacking and such extremes of temperature\r\nexisting why should we seriously consider the question of life on the\r\nmoon?\r\n\r\nThis is the point of view of the majority of astronomers and it seems\r\nwell taken. Yet many astronomers who have made a special study of\r\nthe lunar surface for years under all conditions of illumination and\r\nphase, and have most carefully observed and mapped and photographed\r\nits characteristic markings, are agreed that there are evidences\r\nthat changes are taking place on the moon, and recently Prof. W. H.\r\nPickering has expressed the belief, substantiated by drawings, that\r\nthere is a progressive change of color or darkening within certain\r\nlunar craters with the advance of the lunar day, indicating, in his\r\nopinion, a rapid vegetational growth that springs up in the height\r\nof the lunar day and dies out as the lunar night approaches.\r\n\r\nSome years ago certain selenographers suggested that there might\r\nexist in the numberless crater-pits and craters, in the deep-lying\r\n_maria_ or \"seas,\" and in the clefts and rills and cracks that form\r\nintricate systems all over the lunar surface, certain exhalations\r\nfrom the surface and heavy vapors including possibly carbon dioxide\r\nand water vapor to temper the extremes of the long lunar days and\r\nnight and furnish the necessary medium for the support of certain\r\nforms of animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\nMany astronomers, including a number who are not in sympathy with\r\nthe above view, believe that snow and ice exist on the moon, even\r\nthough water in the form of liquid and vapor is not observable. All\r\nthe extremely brilliant portions of the surface, according to some\r\nastronomers, are covered with snow and ice. Certainly, some portions\r\nof the moon's surface reflect sunlight as brilliantly as if they\r\nwere covered with freshly fallen snow, while other portions appear\r\nto be black by contrast. There also appears to be evidence that\r\ncertain small markings, described as crater-cones and resembling our\r\nterrestrial volcanoes more than any other lunar feature, are at times\r\ntemporarily obscured from view by a veil of vapors. Many observers\r\nbelieve that these crater-cones are active volcanic vents, and that\r\nthere is considerable volcanic activity still taking place upon the\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThese small crater-cones resemble, we are told, parasitic cones found\r\non the sides of terrestrial volcanoes, and they are frequently seen\r\non the floors of craters closely associated with light streaks.\r\nThese crater-cones appear under a high sun as minute white spots\r\nand can be studied to advantage only with powerful instruments.\r\nThe Italian astronomer, Maggini, observing the floor of the lunar\r\ncrater, Plato, in 1916 noted that one of the small crater-cones that\r\nexist there in great numbers, was temporarily obscured from view by\r\na cloud of reddish vapors, and Prof. W. H. Pickering, at Arequipa,\r\nPeru, observing the same region some years ago, believed that he\r\nsaw evidence of change in some of these small markings. The crater,\r\nPlato, has probably been more carefully studied than any other\r\nportion of the lunar surface. It is sixty miles in diameter and may\r\nbe seen even without a telescope as a dark \"eye\" not far from the\r\nnorthern edge of the moon. Its floor is one of the darkest objects in\r\nthe moon--a dark steel-grey in color--and there is no doubt that for\r\nsome unknown reason its dark hue deepens from the time the sun has an\r\naltitude of twenty degrees until after full moon. It has a brilliant\r\nwhite wall rising from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above its floor, crowned\r\nwith several lofty peaks and intersected by a number of valleys and\r\npasses. The spots and faint light markings on the floor have been the\r\nobject of much study with small or moderate sized instruments, and\r\nat least six of them are known to be crater-cones. Since they can\r\nonly be studied to advantage with powerful instruments and as such\r\ninstruments are rarely used for a systematic study of lunar markings,\r\nit is difficult to settle the controversy as to whether they have\r\nchanged in appearance or have been at any time obscured by vapors.\r\nMost lunar observing is done--necessarily--with smaller instruments\r\nbecause the majority of astronomers appear to have accepted the\r\nview that the moon is a dead world, and those who are engaged in\r\nastronomical work with our greatest telescopes seem to feel that\r\nother fields of research will prove more fruitful. Possibly it is\r\nfor this reason that we know so little about our nearest neighbor in\r\nspace! There are at least as many unsolved problems confronting us on\r\nthe moon as there are among the distant stars.\r\n\r\nGeologists tell us that more oxygen is to be found in the first six\r\nfeet of the earth's crust than in all of the atmosphere above. Does\r\noxygen not exist in the surface rocks of the moon as well?\r\n\r\nVolcanic action, we are told, is primarily an escape of gases from\r\nthe interior, chiefly hydrogen, nitrogen, hydrocarbons, sulphur, and\r\nvarious compounds, as well as vast quantities of steam. Beneath the\r\nsurface chemical change is continually taking place which results\r\nin the release of an enormous amount of heat. Some of the gases\r\nmentioned above combine with the oxygen in the surface rocks and heat\r\nis evolved. It is a known fact that there is great inherent heat in\r\nthe earth's surface crust. Why not in the moon's surface crust as\r\nwell?\r\n\r\nThe water that would be expelled in the form of steam from volcanic\r\nvents on the moon would be transformed immediately into hoar-frost,\r\nsnow and ice and would settle down upon the flanks of the\r\ncrater-cones or vents.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that only volcanic activity on an\r\nenormous scale would be plainly visible to us even with the powerful\r\ntelescopes at our command. Ordinary eruptions such as occur on our\r\nown planet would be very difficult to detect. Since the escaping\r\nvapors would rapidly pass into the solid state and settle down\r\nupon the flanks of the crater-cones or vents, we would observe in\r\ngeneral little if any change in an object unless we chanced to be\r\nlooking at it at the time of the eruption, when it might appear to be\r\ntemporarily obscured by a veil of vapors. What are the chances that\r\nwe would be carefully observing at the precise time of an eruption, a\r\nminute marking, two or three miles in diameter, on a surface as large\r\nas all of North America, a surface that is covered with some 30,000\r\ncharted craters, numberless crater-pits, streaks, rays, spots, clefts\r\nand rills in intricate systems, mountain chains and valleys and a\r\nmass of intricate detail?\r\n\r\nIf we were looking at the earth from the moon with the aid of a\r\npowerful telescope would we be apt to notice an eruption of Vesuvius\r\nor Katmai or Mauna Loa? Objects four or five miles in diameter\r\nwould appear as hazy spots with nothing distinctive or remarkable\r\nin their appearance. Yet vapor and steam arising from terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes would be carried by our atmosphere over an area of many\r\nsquare miles, while there is no atmosphere on the moon to spread the\r\nvapors that may arise from similar volcanic vents. It would have\r\nto be a cataclysmic change indeed to be accepted as indisputable\r\nevidence that change is taking place on the moon, and the days of\r\ngigantic upheavals are probably over on our satellite as well as on\r\nthe earth. If volcanic activity is still taking place on the moon it\r\nis probably in a mild form such as a comparatively quiet emission\r\nof gases from volcanic vents and fumaroles. Such forms of activity\r\nwould not be plainly visible at this distance, even with the aid of\r\npowerful telescopes. The problem of detecting changes on the moon is\r\ncomplicated by the fact that a change of illumination greatly alters\r\nthe appearance of all lunar markings. Such a change is continually\r\ntaking place in the course of the month. A marking that stands out\r\nin bold relief at lunar sunrise or sunset will change entirely in\r\nappearance a few days later under a high sun or even disappear from\r\nview entirely. These changes in phase or illumination have to be\r\ntaken account of in the search for evidence of actual change. To\r\ndecide whether or not change has actually taken place the object must\r\nbe viewed under similar conditions, so far as they can be obtained.\r\nEven when special care is taken in this respect the suspected\r\nevidence of change is usually \"explained away\" as due to differences\r\nin illumination or seeing, by those who have not observed the object\r\nthemselves and are not in sympathy with the view that the moon is\r\nanything but a dead world.\r\n\r\nAs regards the question of life on the moon, it is interesting to\r\nconsider the facts brought out by investigations made by scientists\r\nconnected with the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute\r\nin the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. The volcanic activity there\r\ntakes the form of eruptions from numerous small vents or fumaroles\r\nand ninety-nine per cent. of the emanations are water vapor. It was\r\nobserved that blue-green algae were living at the edge of active\r\nvents emitting ammonia compounds at a temperature of 212° F. They\r\nwere not found, however, near vents from which ammonia compounds\r\nwere not being emitted. If life exists under such conditions it is\r\nconceivable that suitable conditions for the support of certain forms\r\nof life, animal as well as vegetable, may be found in low-lying\r\nvalleys and crevices and upon the floors of craters, where certain\r\ngases essential to the support of life might be evolved from many\r\nsmall volcanic vents and fumaroles.\r\n\r\nMany theories have been advanced to explain the origin of the lunar\r\ncraters which have no counterpart on our own planet. They are\r\nsaucer-like depressions in the surface of the moon, frequently of\r\nsuch great size that an observer standing in the center would not\r\nbe able to see either side of the crater owing to the curvature of\r\nthe moon's surface. Craters fifty, sixty or one hundred miles in\r\ndiameter are by no means uncommon, while there are thousands between\r\nfive and fifty miles in diameter. A characteristic feature of many\r\ncraters is a central peak, and the surrounding walls are often a\r\nmile or more high and in some instances are symmetrically terraced.\r\nNew craters have been formed on the sides or floors of old craters,\r\nand these are always more clear-cut and sharper in outlines than the\r\nold formations, and generally much smaller. A number of craters are\r\nsurrounded by a system of light streaks or rays of unknown origin\r\nthat extend in some instances to enormous distances on all sides\r\nof the crater. The most conspicuous system is the one surrounding\r\nthe lunar crater Tycho near the south pole of the moon. The rays\r\noriginating in this crater extend in all directions for hundreds\r\nof miles without turning aside for any obstructions, passing over\r\nmountains, craters and plains in their course in practically straight\r\nlines like spokes in a wheel. This ray system of Tycho is the most\r\nnoticeable marking on the moon's surface at the time of full moon.\r\nAs these streaks cast no shadow they are apparently cracks in the\r\nsurface that have filled up with some light-colored material from\r\nbelow. Their origin has never been satisfactorily explained.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the lunar craters, some believe that they were\r\nproduced in past ages by a bombardment of the lunar surface by huge\r\nmeteoric masses; but there are many objections to this theory that we\r\nwill not take up here. It is more generally believed that the lunar\r\ncraters are a result of volcanic activity on an enormous scale which\r\ntook place on the moon many ages ago and which has now practically\r\nceased, its only manifestations now taking the form of a quiet\r\nemission of gases from small volcanic vents or fumaroles which exist\r\nall over the lunar surface but which are to be found in greatest\r\nnumbers on the floors and sides of craters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nCOMETS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orbits of comets are inclined at all angles to each other and to\r\nthe orbits of the planets which, on the other hand, lie very nearly\r\nin the same plane.\r\n\r\nThe larger members of the sun's family, the planets and their\r\nsatellites, revolve from west to east around the sun. Comets on the\r\ncontrary frequently retrograde or back around the sun in the opposite\r\ndirection--from east to west.\r\n\r\nThe paths that these erratic visitors follow in their journeys around\r\nthe sun bear not the slightest resemblance to the paths of the\r\nplanets, which are almost perfect circles. The orbits of comets are\r\nellipses that are greatly elongated or parabolas. If the orbit is a\r\nparabola the comet makes one and only one visit to the sun, coming\r\nfrom interstellar space and returning thereto after a brief sojourn\r\nwithin our solar system.\r\n\r\nDonati's comet of 1858, one of the greatest comets of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, had a period of more than two thousand years and its\r\naphelion (the point in its orbit farthest away from the sun) was five\r\ntimes more distant than the orbit of Neptune.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a class of comets known as _periodic_ comets\r\nthat have extremely short periods of revolution around the sun.\r\nTo this class belongs Halley's comet whose period of seventy-five\r\nyears exceeds that of any other short period comet. Encke's comet,\r\non the other hand, has a period of three and a third years which is\r\nthe shortest cometary period known. Most of the periodic comets are\r\ninconspicuous and only visible telescopically even when comparatively\r\nnear to the earth. Halley's comet is the only one of this class that\r\nlays any pretensions to remarkable size or brilliancy and it also is\r\nshowing the effects of disintegration resulting from too frequent\r\nvisits to the sun.\r\n\r\nComets are bodies of great bulk or volume and small total mass. Their\r\ntails, which only develop in the vicinity of the sun, are formed of\r\nthe rarest gases, and the best vacuum that man can produce would not\r\nbe in as tenuous a state as the material existing in the tails of\r\ncomets. There are many proofs of the extreme tenuity of comets. The\r\nearth has on a number of occasions passed directly through the tails\r\nof comets without experiencing the slightest visible effects. Stars\r\nshine undimmed in luster even through the heads of comets. If the\r\nearth should encounter a comet \"head on\" it is doubtful if it would\r\nexperience anything more serious than a shower of meteors which would\r\nbe consumed by friction with the earth's atmosphere, or a fall of\r\nmeteorites over a small area of a few square miles. It is possible,\r\nhowever, that matter in the nucleus, the star-like condensation in\r\nthe head of a comet, may consist of individual particles weighing in\r\nsome instances a number of tons, surrounded by a gaseous envelope\r\nand held together by the loose bonds of their mutual attraction. If\r\nthe earth should encounter the nucleus of a comet considerable damage\r\nmight be done over a portion of the earth's surface, but the chances\r\nof such an occurrence are less than one in a million.\r\n\r\nSince the total mass of a comet is so small, a close approach to one\r\nof the planets, especially Jupiter, produces great changes in the\r\nform of the comet's orbit, though the motion of the planet is not\r\ndisturbed in the slightest degree by the encounter.\r\n\r\nThe majority of all the short-period comets have been \"captured\"\r\nby Jupiter, that is, the original orbits have been so changed by\r\nthe perturbations produced by close approaches to the giant planet\r\nthat their aphelia, or the points in their orbits farthest from the\r\nsun, lie in the vicinity of Jupiter's orbit. Several of the other\r\nplanets have also \"captured\" comets in this sense, and the fact that\r\nthe aphelia of a number of comets are grouped at certain definite\r\nintervals beyond the orbit of Neptune has been considered by some\r\nastronomers to be an indication that there are two or more additional\r\nplanets in the solar system revolving around the sun at these\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of a comet is its characteristic tail\r\nwhich develops and increases in size and brilliancy as the comet\r\napproaches the sun. As the tail is always turned away from the sun\r\nit follows the comet as it draws near the sun and precedes it as\r\nit departs. Its origin is due, it is believed, both to electrical\r\nrepulsion and light-pressure acting upon minute particles of matter\r\nin the coma or head of the comet.\r\n\r\nThe curvature of the tail depends upon the nature of the gases\r\nof which it is composed. Long, straight tails consist chiefly of\r\nhydrogen, it has been found, curved tails of hydrocarbons and short,\r\nbushy tails of mixtures of iron, sodium and other metallic vapors. At\r\ntimes the same comet will have two or more tails of different types.\r\n\r\nSince the material driven off from the nucleus or head of a comet by\r\nelectrical repulsion and light-pressure is never recovered, it is\r\nevident that comets are continually disintegrating. Also, comets that\r\nhave passed close to the sun at perihelion have frequently been so\r\ndisrupted by tidal forces that one nucleus has separated into several\r\nparts and the newly formed nuclei have pursued paths parallel to the\r\noriginal orbit, each nucleus developing a tail of its own.\r\n\r\nMany periodic comets, it is now known, have gradually been broken up\r\nand dissipated into periodic swarms of meteors as a result of the\r\ndisruptive effect produced by too frequent returns to the vicinity of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThese swarms of meteors continue to travel around the sun in the\r\norbits of the former comets. The earth encounters a number of such\r\nswarms every year at certain definite times.\r\n\r\nThe largest and best known of these swarms or showers are the\r\nLeonids, which appear about November 15; the Andromedas (or Bielids),\r\nwhich appear later in the same month and the Perseids, which appear\r\nearly in August. These swarms are named for the constellations in\r\nwhich their \"radiant\" lies, that is, the point in the heavens from\r\nwhich they appear to radiate. The position of the radiant depends\r\nupon the direction from which the swarm is coming. It is simply a\r\nmatter of perspective that the individual particles appear to radiate\r\nfrom the one point, for they are actually travelling in parallel\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe luminosity of these meteoric particles is caused by the friction\r\nproduced by their passage through the atmosphere. They always appear\r\nnoiselessly because they are mere particles of meteoric dust weighing\r\nat the most scarcely a grain. They differ greatly in this respect\r\nfrom their large and noisy relatives, the meteorites, bolides and\r\nfireballs.\r\n\r\nNumberless small meteoric particles are entrapped by the earth's\r\natmosphere every day. They are referred to as \"shooting\" stars or\r\n\"falling\" stars though, of course, they are not in any sense stars.\r\nIt is only when these meteoric particles travel in well-defined\r\ncometary orbits and appear at certain definite times every year that\r\nthey are referred to as swarms or showers of meteors.\r\n\r\nThe luminosity of comets is due not only to reflected sunlight, but\r\nto certain unknown causes that produce sudden and erratic increases\r\nor decreases of brilliancy. The causes of these sudden changes in\r\nluminosity are unknown; possibly electrical discharges or chance\r\ncollisions between fragments of considerable size may account for\r\nsome of them.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar behavior of the tails of comets at certain times has\r\nfrequently been noted and suggests the existence of quantities of\r\nfinely-divided meteoric or gaseous matter within the solar system\r\nthat has no appreciable effect upon the huge planetary masses, but\r\noffers sensible resistance to the passage of the tenuous gases of\r\nwhich the tails of comets are composed. The fact that the earth daily\r\nencounters meteoric dust, meteorites and fireballs also indicates\r\nthat meteoric matter exists in considerable quantities within our\r\nsolar system. Tails of comets appear at times to be twisted or\r\nbrushed aside as if they had encountered some unknown force or some\r\nresisting medium.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time several hundred comets have been discovered.\r\nNearly three-fourths of this number travel in orbits that appear to\r\nbe parabolas. Of the remaining number there are about forty that\r\nhave been \"captured\" by the major planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus\r\nand Neptune, though Jupiter possesses the lion's share of these\r\ncaptured comets. Scarcely a year passes by that several comets are\r\nnot discovered. Most of these are telescopic, however, even when they\r\nare near the sun and at their greatest brilliancy. Naked-eye comets\r\nof great splendor and brilliancy are comparatively rare and there\r\nhas been a particular dearth of such unusual comets during the past\r\nthirty years or so.\r\n\r\nThe last spectacular comet, unless we make an exception of Halley's\r\nperiodic comet, which made its return according to prediction in\r\n1910, was the great comet of 1882 which was visible in broad\r\ndaylight close to the sun and at its perihelion passage swept through\r\nthe solar corona with a velocity that exceeded two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles a second and carried it through one hundred and eighty degrees\r\nof its orbit in less than three hours.\r\n\r\nSome comets approach much closer to the sun than others. The majority\r\nof all comets observed have come within the earth's orbit and no\r\nknown comet has its perihelion beyond the orbit of Jupiter. It is, of\r\ncourse, possible that there may be a number of comets that never come\r\nwithin the orbit of Jupiter, but it is very unlikely that any such\r\ncomet would ever be discovered. The majority of comets are simply\r\nsmall, fuzzy points of light that are only visible telescopically and\r\nthe greater the perihelion distance of the comet the less likely is\r\nit to be seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nSince comets as well as planets obey Kepler's first law, known as\r\nthe law of areas, and sweep over equal areas in equal times, it is\r\nevident that when a comet is at perihelion, or nearest to the sun, it\r\nis moving at maximum speed and when it is at aphelion, or farthest\r\nfrom the sun, it is moving at minimum speed. Moreover, its speed at\r\nthese two points in its orbit varies tremendously since the orbits of\r\ncomets are ellipses of very high eccentricity. The speed with which\r\nthe planets are traveling is, on the other hand, remarkably uniform\r\nsince their orbits are nearly circular.\r\n\r\nThe leisurely speed with which a comet travels through the frigid\r\nouter regions of the solar system is gradually accelerated as the\r\ncomet draws nearer and nearer to the sun until it has acquired near\r\nthe time of perihelion passage a velocity that occasionally exceeds\r\ntwo hundred miles a second. Here, also, the great increase in light\r\nand heat and the strong magnetic field of the sun produce complex\r\nchanges in the gaseous and meteoric substances of which the comet is\r\ncomposed until the characteristic tail and peculiar cometary features\r\nare fully developed. As the comet again recedes from the sun after\r\nperihelion passage its speed slackens once more. It soon parts with\r\nits tail and other spectacular features and fades rapidly from view\r\neven in the largest telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nMETEORITES\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorites, bolides or fireballs, as they are variously called, are\r\nstones that fall to the earth from the heavens. They furnish the one\r\ntangible evidence that we possess, aside from that furnished by the\r\nspectroscope, as to the composition of other bodies in space and\r\nit is a significant fact that no unknown elements have ever been\r\nfound in meteorites, though the forms in which they appear are so\r\ncharacteristic that they make these stones readily distinguishable\r\nfrom stones of terrestrial origin.\r\n\r\nThe origin of meteorites is not definitely known, but the evidence is\r\nvery strong in favor of the theory that they are the larger fragments\r\nof disintegrated comets of which meteors and shooting stars are the\r\nsmaller; the distinction between the two being simply that the latter\r\nclass includes all bodies that are completely consumed by friction\r\nwith the earth's atmosphere and, therefore, only reach the surface in\r\nthe form of meteoric dust.\r\n\r\nAccording to other theories meteorites may be fragments of shattered\r\nworlds that have chanced to come too near to a larger body and have\r\nbeen disrupted, or they may possibly be the larger fragments of the\r\ndisintegrated comets of which the meteoric swarms are the smaller.\r\n\r\nInterplanetary space is not altogether a void. Our own planet\r\nsweeps up in the course of a single day, it has been estimated,\r\napproximately twenty million shooting stars or meteors of sufficient\r\nsize to be visible to the naked eye, while the estimate for the\r\ntelescopic particles runs up to four hundred million.\r\n\r\nMeteorites on the other hand are comparatively rare. On the average\r\nit has been estimated about one hundred meteorites strike the earth\r\nin the course of a year, of which number only two or three are\r\nactually seen. According to _Bulletin 94, U. S. National Museum_,\r\napproximately six hundred and fifty falls and finds of meteorites\r\nhave been reported, representatives of which appear in museums and\r\nprivate collections.\r\n\r\nMeteorites, as well as shooting stars and meteors, frequently appear\r\nin showers. In such instances the fall usually consists of several\r\nhundred or thousand individual stones and the area over which they\r\nfall is several square miles in extent and roughly ellipsoidal\r\nin shape. One of the most remarkable of such falls [...] hundred\r\nthousand stones, varying in weight from fifteen pounds to a small\r\nfraction of an ounce, fell near Pultusk, Poland. Another remarkable\r\nfall of meteorites occurred at L'Aigle, France, in 1803. Between two\r\nthousand and three thousand stones fell over an ellipsoidal area of\r\nsix and two-tenths miles in greatest diameter, the aggregate weight\r\nof the stones being not less than seventy-five pounds.\r\n\r\nThis fall of stones is of particular interest since it took place at\r\na time when men were still very doubtful as to whether or not stones\r\nactually fell to earth from the heavens.\r\n\r\nAfter this fall had occurred in a most populous district of France\r\nin broad daylight and attended by violent explosions that lasted for\r\nfive or six minutes and were heard for a distance of seventy-five\r\nmiles, no reasonable doubt could longer be held as to the actuality\r\nof such phenomena.\r\n\r\nMeteorites are without exception of an igneous nature, that is,\r\nthey are rocks that have solidified from a molten condition. They\r\ncan be classified into three groups, Aerolites or Stony Meteorites,\r\nSiderolites or Stony-iron Meteorites, and Siderites or Iron\r\nMeteorites.\r\n\r\nMore iron meteorites seem to have fallen in Mexico and Greenland than\r\nin any other part of the world--at least of its land surface.\r\n\r\nYet strange to say, of all the meteorites that have been seen to\r\nfall only nine belong to the group of Siderites or Iron Meteorites,\r\nthough the three largest meteorites known, Peary's meteorite from\r\nCape York, Greenland, weighing 37-1/2 tons, the meteorite lying on\r\nthe plain near Bacubirito, Mexico, weighing about 20 tons, and the\r\nWillamette, Oregon, meteorite, weighing 15-1/2 tons all belong to\r\nthis group. Moreover, all the Canyon Diablo meteorites, which are\r\nstrewn concentrically around Coon Mountain crater in northern Arizona\r\nto a distance of about five miles, are members of this same group.\r\nCoon Mountain or Meteor crater itself is a perfectly round hole,\r\nabout six hundred feet deep and over four thousand feet in diameter\r\nand was formed, it is believed, by the impact of a huge meteorite\r\nwhich has never been found. It is believed that the Canyon Diablo\r\nmeteorites, of which there are nearly four hundred individuals in\r\nthe U. S. National Museum alone, were all members of this same fall.\r\nIt is possible that these meteorites of the Canyon Diablo district,\r\nwith the huge meteorite that produced the crater itself, formed the\r\nnucleus of a comet that struck the earth not more than five thousand\r\nyears ago, according to the geological evidence.\r\n\r\nAll iron meteorites or siderites (from the Greek sideros, iron) are\r\ncomposed chiefly of alloys of nickel and iron. The percentage of\r\nnickel in these iron meteorites is very small, usually from five to\r\nten per cent., while the iron forms about ninety or ninety-five per\r\ncent. of the whole. Cobalt is also present in practically all iron\r\nmeteorites in small quantities of 1 per cent. or less. Usually small\r\nquantities of iron sulphide and phosphide as well as graphite or\r\nsome other form of carbon appear in the iron meteorites and in some\r\ninstances black and white diamonds have been found, as in some of the\r\nCanyon Diablo irons.\r\n\r\nA very interesting and beautiful feature of many iron meteorites\r\nis the Widmanstätten figures which appear when a section of such a\r\nstone is polished and treated by means of a weak acid. These figures\r\nare due to the unequal solubility of the three different alloys of\r\nnickel and iron of which the stones are composed. The irons giving\r\nthe Widmanstätten figures are known as octahedral irons. Other irons\r\nknown as hexahedral irons give figures of a different type known as\r\nNeumann figures when the polished section is treated with weak acid,\r\nwhile other irons are so homogeneous in their composition that they\r\nshow no figures at all.\r\n\r\nAerolites or Stony Meteorites occur more abundantly than iron or\r\nstony-iron types, and they are classified into many divisions and\r\nsubdivisions according to their composition. In these stones appear\r\ncertain compounds that are commonly met with in terrestrial igneous\r\nrocks. The mineral that is most abundant in the stony meteorites,\r\ncomposing sometimes nearly seventy-five per cent. of the stone,\r\nis a magnesium and iron silicate known as olivine, which is also\r\nusually present in terrestrial rocks of an igneous nature. Certain\r\ncompounds found in the stony meteorites are rarely if ever found in\r\nterrestrial rocks, however, and these serve to distinguish the stony\r\nmeteorites readily from stones of terrestrial origin. The alloys of\r\niron and nickel, for instance, that occur in minor quantities in the\r\nstony meteorites and make up usually about ninety-five per cent.\r\nof the mass of the iron meteorites, are never found in terrestrial\r\nrocks. Although about thirty of the terrestrial elements are to be\r\nfound in meteorites, the forms and compounds in which they appear\r\nare so characteristic and on the whole so different from those\r\noccurring in terrestrial rocks, that the analyst has no difficulty\r\nin distinguishing between the two. There are, for instance certain\r\nformations known as chondrules, peculiar spherical and oval shapes,\r\nvarying in size from minute particles to objects the size of walnuts,\r\nappearing in many varieties of stony meteorites that are never found\r\nin terrestrial rocks, and that are one of the most puzzling features\r\nassociated with the origin and nature of these stones. Sometimes\r\nthe chondrules are so loosely embedded in the stone that they fall\r\naway when it is broken. In some instances almost the entire stone is\r\nmade up of these chondrules. According to one theory the chondrules\r\nwere originally molten drops, like fiery rain, and their internal\r\nstructure, which is greatly varied, depends upon their conditions of\r\ncooling.\r\n\r\nStony meteorites, in which these chondrules are to be found,\r\nare spoken of as chondrites. There are white and gray and black\r\nchondrites and crystalline and carbonaceous chondrites, according to\r\nthe nature of the chondrules found in the stones.\r\n\r\nStony meteorites also contain minute quantities of iron and nickel\r\nalloys in the form of drops or stringers.\r\n\r\nUpon entering the earth's atmosphere stony meteorites become coated\r\nwith a thin black crust which is a glass formed by the fusion of its\r\nsurface materials by the heat generated during its passage through\r\nthe atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn many of the stony meteorites there also appear fine thread-like\r\nveins which are due to the fracturing of the stone prior to its\r\nentrance into the atmosphere. The material filling these veins is\r\ncoal black in color, opaque and of an unknown composition.\r\n\r\nMany meteorites show signs of collisions and encounters with other\r\nmeteorites outside of the atmosphere as would be expected as they\r\ntravel in swarms and groups. Sometimes the entire meteorite is\r\ncomposed of fragments of two or more distinct stones cemented\r\ntogether. Such a stone is spoken of as a _breccia_.\r\n\r\nIn the third class of meteorites to which we now come, known as the\r\nstony-iron meteorites, there is a network or sponge of nickel-iron\r\nalloy, the interstices of which are filled with stony material.\r\n\r\nWhen this network or sponge is continuous the meteorite is spoken of\r\nas a stony-iron pallasite. When the network of metal is more or less\r\ndisconnected the meteorite is a meso-siderite.\r\n\r\nIf meteorites are heated in a vacuum, the conditions existing in\r\ninterplanetary space being thus produced to a certain extent, they\r\ngive forth their occluded gases and it has been found that these\r\ngases give spectra identical with the spectra of certain comets.\r\nMeteoric irons give forth hydrogen as their characteristic gas while\r\nthe gases occluded in the stony meteorites are chiefly the oxides\r\nof carbon, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. It has been found\r\nthat the amount of gases contained in a large meteorite or shower of\r\nmeteorites is sufficient to form the tail of a comet. These facts all\r\ntend to strengthen the belief that meteorites are indeed cometary\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that some geologists believe meteorites may be\r\nfragments of other worlds, it is of interest to know that so far no\r\nfossil-bearing meteorites have been found, and if meteorites are\r\nfragments of a shattered world, such worlds must have been reduced to\r\na molten condition at the time of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe rapid passage of the meteorite through the air leaves a partial\r\nvacuum in its trail into which rush the molecules of air from all\r\nsides, producing the characteristic noises that accompany the passage\r\nof a meteorite, which have been variously compared to the rattle of\r\nartillery, the distant booming of cannons or the rumble of thunder.\r\n\r\nThere may be, also, explosions of inflammable gases occluded in the\r\ncrevices of the meteorite which will shatter it into fragments or\r\nthe meteorite may be shattered by the resistance and pressure of the\r\natmosphere or as a result of the extremes of temperature existing\r\nbetween the interior and its surface. Many meteorites have actually\r\nbeen seen to burst into fragments in the air with a loud report.\r\n\r\nThere is practically no foundation for the belief that germs of life\r\nhave been brought to our planet on such igneous rocks. No microscopic\r\nexaminations of meteorites have yielded any results that could be\r\ninterpreted in favor of such a view.\r\n\r\nFalls of meteorites are accompanied in nearly every instance by\r\nterrific explosions and sharp reports that can be heard for many\r\nmiles around, often causing the ground to shake as in an earthquake.\r\nThe meteorite itself has been described as resembling a ball of\r\nfire or the headlight of a locomotive, and is followed frequently\r\nby a trail of light or a cloud of smoke. At the time it enters our\r\natmosphere a meteorite is moving with planetary velocity ranging from\r\ntwo to forty-five miles per second. Its interior is intensely cold,\r\napproaching in temperature the absolute zero of interplanetary space,\r\nand it is, therefore, far more brittle than it would be at ordinary\r\ntemperatures. As it ploughs its way into the earth's atmosphere its\r\nsurface temperature is soon raised by friction to at least 3,000° or\r\n4,000° C., which is sufficient to fuse all surface materials into the\r\ncharacteristic black crust, with which stony meteorites are coated.\r\n\r\nMeteorites are usually first seen at an altitude of fifty or sixty\r\nmiles. Although they are moving with a velocity comparable to that of\r\nthe planets, when they enter the earth's atmosphere, this velocity is\r\nso rapidly reduced by friction with the atmosphere that they usually\r\ndrop to the surface of the earth with a velocity about equal to that\r\nof ordinary falling objects.\r\n\r\nThe flight of a meteorite often extends over a path several hundred\r\nmiles in length and the meteorite may be seen by many observers in\r\nseveral different States and yet finally fall in some unknown spot\r\nand never be found.\r\n\r\nThe evidence gathered regarding the actual fall of meteorites is\r\noften contradictory. Some stones are too hot to handle for hours\r\nafter they fall, others are merely warm, while still others have been\r\npicked up cool or even intensely cold. Meteorites have been seen to\r\nfall upon dried grass and upon straw without producing even charring\r\neffects. The evidence regarding the depths to which meteorites\r\npenetrate the ground is quite as conflicting. The largest of all\r\nthe stony meteorites which fell at Krnyahinya, Hungary, weighed 647\r\npounds and buried itself to a depth of eleven feet. Yet Peary's Cape\r\nYork iron meteorite, weighing 37-1/2 tons, was only partially covered\r\nand showed no signs of abrasions of surface resulting from the fall.\r\n\r\nThe Willamette iron meteorite, weighing 16-1/2 tons, lay in a forest\r\nwhen found and was not deeply buried. The Bacubirito iron meteorite,\r\nweighing 20 tons, lay in soft soil, barely beneath the level of the\r\nsurface. On the other hand a fragment of a stony-iron meteorite,\r\nweighing 437 pounds, that fell at Estherville, Iowa, buried itself\r\neight feet in stiff clay.\r\n\r\nGeologists in charge of the meteoric collections of various museums\r\nquite frequently have stones sent to them for analysis that are\r\nreputed to be of celestial origin. More often than not such stones\r\nare found to be purely terrestrial in their origin. The composition\r\nof a meteorite is so characteristic and unique that such a stone can\r\nnever be mistaken. Finds of bona-fide meteorites are on the whole\r\nextremely rare.\r\n\r\nIt is also a peculiar fact that meteorites are usually observed in\r\nthe months when ordinary meteors or periodic swarms of meteors are\r\nleast prevalent, that is in the months of May, June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AS A MAGNET\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a small, freely suspended compass needle is moved over a highly\r\nmagnetized steel sphere, it will be seen that it constantly changes\r\nits position both horizontally and vertically so as to lie always\r\nalong the \"lines of force\" of the sphere.\r\n\r\nThere will be one point on the sphere which we will call the _North\r\nMagnetic Pole_, where the _north-seeking_ end of the needle will\r\npoint vertically downward or make a \"dip\" of 90° with the tangent\r\nplane. At the diametrically opposite point on the sphere, called\r\nthe South Magnetic Pole, the opposite end of the compass, the\r\nsouth-seeking end, will point vertically downward; while at a point\r\nmidway between the magnetic poles of the sphere the needle will lie\r\nparallel to the diameter connecting the two poles and there will be\r\nno dip.\r\n\r\nThe total intensity of the magnetic field surrounding the sphere will\r\nbe found to be greatest in the vicinity of the magnetic poles and\r\nleast, midway between the poles.\r\n\r\nNow, a freely suspended compass needle carried to all parts of the\r\nearth will behave very much in the same manner as the needle moved\r\nover the magnetized steel sphere. There are two points on the earth's\r\nsurface, known as the North and South Magnetic Poles, where the\r\nneedle points vertically downward and approximately midway between is\r\nthe _Magnetic Equator_ where the compass needle places itself in a\r\nperfectly horizontal position and the \"dip\" of the needle is zero. In\r\nother words, the earth acts as a huge magnet and possesses a magnetic\r\nfield with lines of force converging towards its poles similar to the\r\nlines of force of the steel sphere.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some very important differences between the\r\nsphere of steel and our earth. The matter of which the earth is\r\ncomposed is not homogeneous. It is believed to possess an iron core\r\nof considerable size, it is true, but its outer shell is composed of\r\nheterogeneous masses that in certain regions cause very appreciable\r\nlocal deflections of the needle. It is surrounded, moreover, by an\r\natmosphere permeated by electrified particles of matter shot forth\r\nfrom the sun, which we now know is a still greater magnet surrounded\r\nby a magnetic field that is of the order of 50 gausses at the poles\r\nand about eighty times more powerful than that of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is now a well-established fact that the sun's magnetic field\r\nexerts a powerful influence over the condition of the earth's\r\nmagnetic field, and that vast solar disturbances affect very\r\nmaterially the direction and intensity of the lines of force.\r\n\r\nIt is thus little wonder that this non-homogeneous and rapidly\r\nrotating terrestrial globe, surrounded by an electrified atmosphere\r\nand subject to the action of a still more powerful magnet, the sun,\r\nshould not behave in a manner exactly analogous to a uniformly\r\nmagnetized steel sphere.\r\n\r\nThe earth's magnetic poles are neither symmetrically placed nor\r\nabsolutely fixed in position. There is every reason to suspect\r\nthat they shift about from year to year, and possibly fluctuate\r\nirregularly in position in the course of a few days or hours under\r\nthe influence of disturbing forces. The position of the earth's\r\nNorth Magnetic Pole, last visited by Amundsen in 1903, now lies\r\napproximately in Latitude 70° N. Longitude 97° W. The position of\r\nthe South Magnetic Pole, according to the latest determinations,\r\nis, in round numbers, in Latitude 73° S. and Longitude 156° E. of\r\nGreenwich. It is evident, therefore, that the magnetic poles of the\r\nearth are not symmetrically placed and that they lie fully 30° from\r\nthe _geographical_ poles. The chord connecting the magnetic poles\r\npasses 750 miles from the earth's center, and it is about 1,200 miles\r\nfrom the geographic pole to the nearest magnetic pole. There exist,\r\nmoreover, in high latitudes local magnetic poles, due possibly to\r\nheavy local deposits of ore. One such pole was discovered at Cape\r\nTreadwell, near Juneau, Alaska, during Dr. L. A. Bauer's observations\r\nthere in 1900 and 1907. In the center of the observing tent at\r\nthis point the needle pointed vertically downward and the compass\r\n_reversed_ its direction when carried from one side of the tent to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that there are very few points on the\r\nearth's surface where the compass needle points either to the true\r\ngeographical pole or to the magnetic pole, and if it does chance to\r\ndo so, it is a transient happening. The \"variation of the compass\"\r\nor the declination of the needle, as it is called, is the angle that\r\nthe compass needle makes with the true north and south line or the\r\nmeridian. It is an angle of greatest importance to navigators and\r\nexplorers, for it gives them their bearings, yet it is unfortunately\r\nsubject to ceaseless variations of a most complicated nature, since\r\nit depends on the constantly pulsating and never ceasing magnetic\r\nchanges that sweep over the surface of the earth and through its\r\ncrust. It is affected by long period or secular changes, as they\r\nare called, progressing more or less regularly in obscure cycles of\r\nunknown period. It is subject to a diurnal change that depends on the\r\nposition of the sun relative to the meridian, and that varies with\r\nthe seasons and with the hour of the day. It is affected by the sun\r\nspot cycle of 11.3 years which has a direct effect upon the intensity\r\nof the earth's magnetic field. The intensity of the magnetic field in\r\nsun spots is, according to Abbot, sometimes as high as 4,500 gausses\r\nor 9,000 times the intensity of the earth's field. At times of\r\nmaximum spottedness of the sun the intensity of the earth's magnetic\r\nfield is reduced.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when great and rapidly changing spots appear upon the\r\nsun, electrified particles are shot forth from the sun with great\r\nvelocity and in great numbers, and are drawn in towards the magnetic\r\npoles of the earth. Meeting the rarefied gases of the earth's upper\r\natmosphere, they illuminate them as electric discharges illuminate\r\na vacuum tube. Some of these electrons are absorbed by gases at\r\nhigh elevations, other descend to lower levels. The most penetrating\r\nrays have been known to descend to an altitude of twenty-five miles\r\nwhich is about the lowest limit yet found for auroral displays. It\r\nis the passage of these rays through the atmosphere that cause the\r\nmagnetic disturbances known as _magnetic storms_, that are associated\r\nwith the appearance of great sun spots and auroral displays. At such\r\ntimes sudden changes take place in the intensity of the earth's\r\nmagnetic field that cause the compass needle to shiver and tremble\r\nand temporarily lose its directive value. These _magnetic storms_\r\nhave been known to produce great temporal changes in the intensity\r\nof the earth's field. According to Dr. L. A. Bauer, Director of the\r\nDepartment of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institute of\r\nWashington, the earth's intensity of magnetization was altered by\r\nabout one-twentieth or one-thirtieth part by the magnetic storm of\r\nSeptember 25, 1909, which was one of the most remarkable on record,\r\nand the earth's magnetic condition was below par for fully three\r\nmonths afterwards as a result.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these various regular and irregular changes in the\r\nvariation of the compass, or declination of the needle, due to\r\nchanges in the earth's magnetic field _as a whole_, there are local\r\neffects due to restricted regional disturbances of the earth's\r\nmagnetic field or to local deposits of ore, or to volcanoes or\r\nother local causes. The effect of all these disturbances upon the\r\ndeclination of the needle must be determined by continual magnetic\r\nsurveys of all portions of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nAs a whole the earth's magnetic field is more uniform over the oceans\r\nthan over the land, with all its disturbing topographical features.\r\nYet this advantage is offset largely in navigation by the fact that\r\nevery steel ship that sails the seas is a _magnet_, with its two\r\nmagnetic poles and its neutral line where the two opposite magnetic\r\nforces are neutralized, as is the case with every magnet. The\r\ndirection in which a steel ship lies with reference to the earth's\r\nmagnetic field while it is being built determines the position of\r\nthe magnetic poles in its hull and the position of its neutral line\r\nand this distribution of magnetism over a ship's hull must be taken\r\naccount of in the installation of its standard compass. Every piece\r\nof horizontal and vertical iron aboard ship has an effect upon the\r\nvariation of the compass and compensation must be made for such\r\ndisturbing forces. The direction of sailing, the position in which a\r\nship lies at dock, storms encountered at sea, the firing of batteries\r\n(on warships) are some of the factors that are operative in producing\r\nchanges in the variation of the magnetic compass aboard a ship.\r\n\r\nEvery ship must undergo at frequent intervals magnetic surveys for\r\nthe purpose of determining its magnetic constants and its \"Table of\r\nDeviations of the Compass.\"\r\n\r\nThe direction in which the compass needle points aboard ship is the\r\n_resultant_ of the effect of the earth's magnetic field and the\r\nmagnetic field of the ship, and both fields are subject to continual\r\nand complicated variations from year to year, from day to day, _and\r\neven from hour to hour_!\r\n\r\nThe elements of the earth's magnetic field are determined for any one\r\nepoch by long-continued magnetic surveys carried on to a greater or\r\nless extent by the various nations of the world, and the results are\r\npublished in the form of _magnetic charts_ for land and sea, showing\r\nthe values of the three magnetic elements, declination of the needle,\r\ndip or inclination, and horizontal intensity of the earth's field\r\nfor a definite period. So rapid are even the long-period changes in\r\nthe earth's magnetic field that a magnetic chart can be relied upon\r\nfor only a very few years and fresh data for the construction of\r\nthese charts that are so valuable to navigators and explorers must be\r\ngathered continually.\r\n\r\nThe _Department of Terrestrial Magnetism_ of the Carnegie Institute\r\nof Washington is engaged in continual magnetic surveys of the earth\r\nby land and sea that are of the highest value not only to navigators\r\nbut also to scientists interested in solving the great and mysterious\r\nproblem of the underlying causes of the earth's magnetism.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the extent and scope of the work of this\r\ndepartment it may be mentioned that its non-magnetic ship _Carnegie_\r\nmade in the period 1909-1918 a total run of 189,176 nautical miles,\r\nnearly nine times the earth's circumference, with an average\r\nday's run of 119 nautical miles. Magnetic observations were made\r\npractically every day at a distance of 100 to 150 miles apart. In\r\nthis nine-year period five cruises were made. On her first cruise\r\nthe _Carnegie_ sailed from St. John's, Newfoundland, to Falmouth,\r\nEngland, over practically the same course followed by the famous\r\nastronomer, Halley, in the _Paramour Pink_ two centuries earlier to\r\ndetermine the variation of the compass. In her fourth voyage the\r\n_Carnegie_ circumnavigated the world in sub-antarctic regions in 118\r\ndays--a record time. She has traversed all oceans from 80° North to\r\nthe parallel of 60° South and has crossed and recrossed her own path\r\nand the path of her predecessor, the _Galilee_, many times, thus\r\nmaking it possible to determine for the points of intersection the\r\nsecular changes in the magnetic elements.\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough overhauling in 1919 and the installation of a\r\nfour-cylinder gasoline engine, _made of bronze_ throughout, to take\r\nthe place of the producer-gas engine used on earlier cruises, the\r\n_Carnegie_ started on her sixth cruise with a crew of twenty-three\r\nofficers and men on October 9, 1919. A cruise of 61,500 miles was\r\nplanned in the South Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans to last\r\napproximately two years. Unsurveyed regions in the South Atlantic and\r\nIndian Ocean were to be covered and the route was planned so as to\r\nobtain a large number of observations of the progressive changes that\r\nhave taken place in the magnetic elements. This is accomplished as\r\nstated above by intersecting former routes and obtaining new values\r\nof the element at the points of intersection.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its ocean magnetic surveys the _Department of\r\nTerrestrial Magnetism_ also carries on extensive land surveys in all\r\nparts of the globe. In 1919 special expeditions were sent out by the\r\nDepartment to observe the total solar eclipse of May 29th at stations\r\ndistributed over the entire zone of visibility of the eclipse and\r\nimmediately outside. At Dr. Bauer's station in Liberia the total\r\nphase was visible in a cloudless sky for more than six minutes, which\r\nis very close to the maximum length of phase that can possibly be\r\nobserved. Unmistakable evidence was gathered at all stations of an\r\nappreciable variation in the earth's magnetic field during a solar\r\neclipse, which variation is the reverse of that causing the daylight\r\nportion of the solar diurnal variation of the needle.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the magnetic survey work on land and sea which\r\nis the chief work of the _Department of Terrestrial Magnetism_,\r\natmospheric-electric observations are carried on continually on land\r\nand sea and experiments have been carried on at Langley Field, Va.,\r\nlately, in the development of methods and instruments for determining\r\nthe geographical position of airplanes by astronomical observations.\r\nThere has also been recently formed under this department a _Section\r\nof Terrestrial Electricity_.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the earth's magnetic field is still one of the greatest\r\nunsolved problems of astro-physics. The theory that has been\r\nadvanced by Schuster that all large rotating masses are magnets _as\r\na result of their rotation_ has received considerable attention\r\nfrom astrophysicists, and attempts have been made to prove this\r\nexperimentally. It has been found that iron globes spun at high\r\nvelocities in the laboratory do _not_ exhibit magnetic properties.\r\nThis may mean simply that the magnetic field is too weak to be\r\ndetected in the case of a comparatively small iron sphere spun for\r\na limited period under laboratory conditions. It must be remembered\r\nthat the earth has been rotating rapidly on its axis for millions\r\nof years and is, compared to terrestrial objects, an extremely\r\nlarge mass. Yet it has been shown that as a whole our earth is an\r\nextremely weak magnet, and that if it were made entirely of steel and\r\nmagnetized as highly as an ordinary steel-bar magnet, the magnetic\r\nforces at its surface would be a thousand times greater than they\r\nactually are.\r\n\r\nIf it is true that all rotating bodies are magnets, then all the\r\nheavenly bodies, planets, suns and nebulæ are surrounded by magnetic\r\nfields. We know nothing to the contrary. In fact, we know this to be\r\ntrue for the earth and sun, and strongly suspect that it is so in the\r\ncase of the planets Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n\r\nWhen we understand more about the properties of matter, the nature of\r\nmagnetism, as well as of gravity, may be revealed to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nSOME EFFECTS OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE UPON SUNLIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the atmosphere to\r\nall forms of life upon the surface of the earth. If there were no\r\natmosphere there would be no life, because it is through the agency\r\nof the water-vapor, carbon-dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere that\r\nall life-processes are maintained.\r\n\r\nIf there were no atmosphere there would not only be no life upon\r\nthe earth; there would be also none of the beautiful color effects\r\nproduced by the passage of sunlight through the atmosphere. There\r\nwould be no blue skies, no beautiful sunrise and sunset effects, no\r\ntwilight, no rainbows, no halos, no auroral displays, no clouds, no\r\nrains, no rivers nor seas, no winds nor storms. The heavens would be\r\nperfectly black except in the direction of the heavenly bodies which\r\nwould shine as brilliantly by day as by night.\r\n\r\nTo understand how the atmosphere produces color effects such as blue\r\nskies, sunrise and sunset tints, rainbows and halos, as well as the\r\ntwinkling of the stars, and numerous other phenomena, we must know\r\nsomething of the nature of light itself.\r\n\r\nLight moves outward from any source, such as the sun, in all\r\ndirections radially, or along straight lines (so long as it does not\r\nencounter a gravitational field) with the unimaginable velocity of\r\n186,000 miles per second. As it advances it vibrates or oscillates\r\nback and forth across its path in all directions at right angles to\r\nthis path, unless it is plane polarized light, in which case its\r\nvibrations are confined to one plane only.\r\n\r\nThese vibrations or oscillations of light take the form of a wavelike\r\nmotion, one wave-length being the distance passed over in the time of\r\none vibration, measured from crest to crest or from trough to trough\r\nof adjacent waves.\r\n\r\nWe may consider that a beam or ray of sunlight is made up of a great\r\nnumber of individual rays of different wave-lengths and different\r\ncolors. The average wave-length of light, the wave-length of the\r\ngreen ray in sunlight, is about one-fifty-thousandth part of an\r\ninch, that is, it would take about fifty-thousand wave-lengths of\r\ngreen light to cover a space of one inch. Now, since light makes one\r\nvibration in passing over a distance of one wave-length, it makes\r\nfifty thousand vibrations, while advancing one inch, and since it\r\nadvances one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles in one second we\r\ncan easily figure out that a ray of sunlight of average wave-length\r\nmakes about six hundred trillion vibrations (600,000,000,000,000) in\r\na single second!\r\n\r\nThe chief colors of which sunlight or white light is composed\r\nare red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, though\r\nthere are an infinite number of gradations of color which blend\r\ninto one another, gradually producing the intermediate tints and\r\nshades. The colors just mentioned are called the primary colors\r\nof the solar spectrum, which can be produced as a band of light\r\nof variegated colors, arranged in the order named by passing a\r\nray of ordinary sunlight through a glass prism. The individual\r\nrays of different color and wave-length that make up a beam of\r\nsunlight, or white light, then separate out in the order of the\r\nwave-lengths. The red rays vibrate the most slowly and have the\r\nlongest wave-length of all the rays of the visible spectrum. About\r\nfour hundred trillion vibrations of red light reach the eye in one\r\nsecond. Violet rays, on the other hand, vibrate the most rapidly\r\nof all the visible rays and have the shortest wave-length. About\r\neight hundred trillion vibrations of violet light reach the eye\r\nevery second. The wave-lengths of the intermediate colors decrease\r\nin length progressively from the red to the violet and, of course,\r\nthe frequencies of their vibrations increase in the same order. All\r\nsunlight is made up of these rays of different colors and different\r\nvibration frequencies, and of other rays as well, to which the human\r\neye is not sensitive, and which, therefore, do not appear in the\r\nvisible spectrum. Among these invisible rays are the infra-red rays\r\nwhich come just below the red of the visible spectrum, and which are\r\nof longer wave-length than the red rays, and the ultra-violet rays,\r\nwhich lie beyond the violet rays of the visible spectrum, and are of\r\nshorter wave-length than the violet rays.\r\n\r\nNow a ray of ordinary sunlight is separated into the rays of various\r\ncolors, which form the solar spectrum when it passes from a medium\r\nof one density obliquely to a medium of another density, as when it\r\npasses from air to glass, or from air to water, or from outer space\r\ninto the earth's atmosphere. Under such circumstances its velocity\r\nis slowed down when it passes from a rare to a denser medium, and\r\nthe waves of different wave-lengths are bent from their former\r\ncourse, or refracted, by different amounts. The red rays, of longest\r\nwave-length, are bent from their former course the least, and the\r\nviolet rays, of shortest wave-length, are bent the most upon passing\r\nfrom a rare to a denser medium. As a result the ray of sunlight\r\nis spread out or dispersed into its rays of different wave-length\r\nand color upon entering a medium of different density. It is this\r\nrefraction and dispersion of sunlight that produces many color\r\neffects in the earth's atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is not of uniform density throughout. At high\r\naltitudes it is extremely rare. That is, there is little of it\r\nin a given volume. Close to the earth's surface, however, it is\r\ncomparatively dense. Half of all the atmosphere is within three and\r\none-half miles of the surface and half of the remainder lies within\r\nthe next three and a half miles. We may consider it as made up, on\r\nthe whole, of layers of different densities, strongly compressed near\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nImagine a ray of sunlight entering the earth's atmosphere from\r\nwithout. If it comes from a point in the zenith its course is not\r\nchanged upon entering the atmosphere, because light passing from a\r\ncertain medium--as space--into a medium of different density, is\r\nnot bent from its course, or refracted, provided it enters the new\r\nmedium in a direction perpendicular to the surface. If it enters the\r\natmosphere (which is the new medium of greater density) _obliquely_,\r\nrefraction, or bending of the ray, takes place, and as the ray\r\nadvances toward the earth, through layers of increasing densities,\r\nit is bent from its former course more and more. As the advancing\r\nrays of different colors and wave-lengths in the beam of sunlight\r\nare slowed down in the new medium, the red rays are turned from\r\ntheir course the least and the violet rays the most and the entire\r\nadvancing wave-front of the beam of sunlight is bent down more and\r\nmore toward the horizon, as it proceeds through the atmosphere. As we\r\non the earth's surface see the ray not along its bent course through\r\nthe atmosphere, but in the direction in which it finally enters our\r\neyes, the effect of refraction upon a ray of light passing through\r\nthe atmosphere is to displace the object in the direction of the\r\nzenith or increase its distance above the horizon. As a result of\r\nrefraction we see the sun--or moon--above the western horizon after\r\nit has really set, and above the eastern horizon before it has really\r\nrisen. The oval shape that the sun, or moon, often presents on\r\nrising or setting, is due to the fact that the light from the lower\r\nlimb is passing through denser air than the light from the upper\r\nlimb, and so is refracted more. As a result the lower limb is lifted\r\nproportionately more than the upper limb. This distorts the form of\r\nthe solar or lunar disk, making it appear oval instead of circular.\r\n\r\nThe familiar twinkling or scintillation of stars and, more rarely,\r\nof the planets, is a result of interference of light waves due to\r\nirregular and variable refraction in air that is not uniform in\r\ndensity, owing to the presence of constantly rising and descending\r\natmospheric currents of different densities. This also produces\r\nthe shimmering or unsteadiness of star images in the telescope,\r\nthat interferes so greatly with accurate measurements of angles or\r\nobservations of planetary markings.\r\n\r\nOne may ask why it is, if light from an object, say a star, is bent\r\nfrom its course and separated into rays of various colors upon\r\nentering the earth's atmosphere, that we do not see the object\r\ndrawn out into a band of spectral colors. It is because the angular\r\nseparation of the various colors is so slight under ordinary\r\ncircumstances that light from one point is blended with light from\r\na neighboring point of complementary color to produce white light\r\nagain. Under certain circumstances, however, beautiful color effects\r\nmay be seen in the earth's atmosphere as a result of the refraction\r\nof sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe blue color of the sky and its brightness is caused by the\r\nscattering of the rays of shortest wave-length, the violet and\r\nblue rays, by the oxygen and nitrogen in the upper atmosphere. The\r\nmolecules of these gases interfere with the passage of these rays,\r\npowerfully scattering and dispersing them, and thus increasing the\r\nlength of their path through the air and diffusing their color and\r\nbrightness in the upper atmosphere, while permitting rays of longer\r\nwave-length, the red and orange, to pass on practically undisturbed.\r\n\r\nWhen an object in the heavens lies close to the horizon, the rays of\r\nlight from it have to travel a longer path through the atmosphere\r\nthan when the object is overhead, and that too through the densest\r\npart of the atmosphere, which lies close to the earth's surface,\r\nand in which are floating many dust particles and impurities from\r\nthe earth's surface. All these particles, as well as the increased\r\ndensity of the atmosphere, interfere with the free passage of the\r\nrays, especially of shorter wave-lengths. The violet and blue rays\r\nare sifted out and scattered in their long journey through the lower\r\nstrata of air, far more than when they come to us from an object\r\nhigh in the sky. Even the red and yellow rays are more or less\r\nscattered and bent aside--diffracted--by these comparatively large\r\nparticles near the surface. The reddish color of the sun, moon and\r\neven of the stars and planets, when seen near the horizon, as well\r\nas the beautiful sunset tints, in which reds and pinks and yellows\r\npredominate, are due to the fact that the rays of longer wave-length\r\nare more successful in penetrating the dense, dust-laden layers of\r\nthe lower atmosphere. It is to be free of the dust and impurities as\r\nwell as the unsteadiness of the lower atmosphere, that observatories\r\nare built at high altitudes whenever possible.\r\n\r\nWhen there have been unusually violent volcanic eruptions, and great\r\nquantities of finely divided dust have been thrown into the upper\r\natmosphere, the effect upon the blue and violet rays from the sun is\r\nvery great. The volcanic dust particles are so large that instead of\r\nscattering these rays of shorter wave-length, as do the oxygen and\r\nnitrogen in our atmosphere, they reflect them back into space and so\r\ndecrease the amount of light and heat received from the sun. For this\r\nreason the general temperature of the earth is lowered by violent\r\nvolcanic eruptions. Unusually cold periods, that lasted for months,\r\nfollowed the terrible eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 and of Katmai in\r\n1912.\r\n\r\nAt times when much dust is present in the atmosphere, the sky\r\nis a milky white color by day as a result of the reflection of\r\nsunlight from the dust particles. Sunrise and sunset colors are then\r\nparticularly gorgeous, with reds predominating. At such times the\r\nblue and violet rays are almost completely shut out, and the red,\r\norange and yellow rays are powerfully diffracted and scattered by the\r\ndust particles in the air.\r\n\r\nThe twilight glow that is visible for some time before sunrise or\r\nafter sunset is, of course, entirely an atmospheric effect caused by\r\nthe reflection of sunlight to our eyes from the upper atmosphere,\r\nupon which the sun shines, while it is, itself, concealed from\r\nour view below the horizon. The atmosphere extends in quantities\r\nsufficient to produce twilight to an elevation of about sixty miles.\r\n\r\nWhen _all_ the rays of which sunlight is composed are reflected in\r\nequal proportions we get the impression of white light. Dust and haze\r\nin the air reflect all rays strongly and give a whitish color to an\r\notherwise blue sky. Brilliant white clouds appear white, because they\r\nare reflecting all rays equally. Clouds or portions of clouds appear\r\nblack when they are in shade or, at times, by contrast with portions\r\nthat are more strongly illuminated, or when they are moisture-laden\r\nand near the point of saturation, when they are absorbing more light\r\nthan they reflect. At sunrise and sunset, when the light that falls\r\nupon the clouds is richest in red and orange and yellow, clouds\r\nreflect these colors to our eyes, and we see the brilliant sunset\r\nhues which are more intense the more the air is filled with dust and\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nThe familiar and beautiful phenomenon of the rainbow is produced\r\nby refraction, reflection and interference of sunlight by drops of\r\nfalling water, such as rain or spray. As the ray of sunlight enters\r\nthe drop of water, which acts as a tiny glass prism, it is refracted\r\nor bent from its course and spread out into its spectral colors.\r\nReflection of these rays next takes place (once or twice, as the\r\ncase may be) from the inside of the drop and a second refraction of\r\nthe reflected ray takes place as it leaves the drop. The smaller the\r\ndrops the more brilliant is the rainbow and the richer in color.\r\nThe most brilliant rainbows are produced by drops between 0.2 and\r\n0.4 millimeters in diameter. In addition to the primary bow, which\r\nhas a red outer border with a radius of 42°, there is the secondary\r\nbow with a radius of about 51° and with colors reversed, the red\r\nbeing on the inner border; the supernumerary bows which are narrow\r\nbands of red, or green and red, appear parallel to the primary and\r\nsecondary bows along the inner side of the primary bow and the outer\r\nside of the secondary bow. No rainbow arches ever appear between the\r\nprimary and secondary bows, and it can be shown in fact, that the\r\nillumination between these two bows is at a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe primary, secondary and supernumerary bows all lie opposite the\r\nsun in the direction of the observer's shadow and the observer must\r\nstand with his back to the sun in order to see them. The primary and\r\nsecondary rainbow arches take the form of arcs of circles that have\r\ntheir common center on the line connecting the sun with the observer\r\nat a point as far below the horizon in angular distance as the sun is\r\nabove the horizon. It is, therefore, never possible to see a rainbow\r\narch of more than a semicircle in extent unless the observer is at an\r\nelevation above the surrounding country, under which circumstances\r\nit might be possible to see a complete circle formed by the rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe highest and longest arch appears when the sun is on the horizon,\r\nand the greater the altitude of the sun the smaller and lower the\r\nvisible arch. As the angular radius of the primary bow is 42° and of\r\nthe secondary bow 51° and as the common center of the two circles\r\nis always as far below the horizon as the sun is above, it is never\r\npossible to see either primary or secondary rainbow when the altitude\r\nof the sun is over 51°, or the primary bow when the altitude is over\r\n42°. For this reason rainbows are rarely seen at or near noon in\r\nmid-latitudes, since the sun is usually at an elevation of more than\r\n42° at noon, especially in the summer season, which is also the most\r\nfavorable season for rainbows, owing to the great likelihood of rain\r\nand sunshine occurring at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe light which comes to an observer from the primary bow is once\r\nreflected within the drop, and that which comes from the secondary\r\nbow is twice reflected within the drop. The sharper and brighter\r\nlight therefore comes from the primary bow of 42° radius. The space\r\nbetween the two bows is particularly dark, because it can be shown\r\nthat the drops there do not reflect any light at all.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow colors are rarely pure or arranged in spectral order,\r\nowing to interference of light waves. It is the interference of light\r\nwaves from different parts of the same drop that produces the bands\r\nof alternate maximum and minimum brightness, that lie below the\r\nprimary bow and beyond the secondary bow. The red or green and red\r\nbands of maximum brightness produced thus by interference, are called\r\nthe supernumerary bows, and they are always found parallel to the\r\nprimary and secondary bow within the former and above the latter.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the rainbow from the observer is the distance of\r\nthe drops that form it. A rainbow may be formed by clouds several\r\nmiles distant or by the aid of the garden hose on our lawn. No two\r\nobservers can see exactly the same rainbow because the rainbow arch\r\nencircles the surface of a cone whose vertex is at the observer's\r\neye and no two such vertices can exactly coincide. Two observers see\r\nrainbows formed by different drops.\r\n\r\nRefraction of light by ice-crystals in clouds produces many\r\nbeautiful color effects, such as halos of various types around\r\nsun or moon, vertical light pillars, circumzenithal arcs, and\r\nparhelia--\"sun-dogs\"--or paraselenæ--\"moon-dogs\"--which are luminous\r\nspots at equal altitudes with sun or moon--one to the left the other\r\nto the right, at an angular distance of 22°.\r\n\r\nThe most usual form of halo is that of 22° radius. This is a luminous\r\nring of light surrounding sun or moon, with the inner edge red and\r\nsharply defined and the spectral colors proceeding outward in order;\r\nred is frequently the only color visible, the remainder of the ring\r\nappearing whitish. Since the halo is produced by refraction of light\r\nby ice-crystals, which exist in clouds of a certain type gathering at\r\nhigh altitudes, it is always a very good indicator of an approaching\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\nCoronas are luminous rings showing the spectral colors in the\r\nreverse order, that is, with the inner edge blue instead of red.\r\nThey are usually of very small radius, scarcely two degrees, closely\r\nsurrounding sun or moon and are produced--not by refraction--but\r\nby _diffraction_ or a bending aside of the rays as they pass\r\nbetween--without entering--very small drops of water in clouds. As in\r\nthe case of refraction, the red rays are turned from their course the\r\nleast and the violet rays the most.\r\n\r\nMany of these phenomena--halos, luminous spots, vertical pillars and\r\narcs of light may, at times, be seen simultaneously, when clouds of\r\nice-crystals are forming around the sun or moon. They then present a\r\nvery complex and beautiful outline of luminous circles, arches and\r\npillars that have a mysterious and almost startling appearance when\r\nthe cause is not clearly understood.\r\n\r\nWe have found then that sunlight is made up of rays of many\r\ndifferent wave-lengths and colors and that the atmosphere acts upon\r\nthese rays in various ways. It reflects them or turns them back\r\non their course; it refracts them as they pass through the gases\r\nof which the atmosphere consists, or through the water-vapor and\r\nice-crystals suspended in it, thus sifting out and dispersing the\r\nrays of different colors and wave-lengths and producing beautiful\r\ncolor effects; it _diffracts_ them or bends them aside as they pass\r\nbetween the fine dust particles and small drops of water in the air,\r\nagain sifting out the rays of different colors and producing color\r\neffects similar to those produced by refraction; it also scatters\r\nand disperses, through the action of the molecules of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen in the upper strata, the blue and violet rays of shorter\r\nwave-length and thus produces the blue color and brightness of the\r\nsky; it produces beautifully colored auroral streamers and curtains\r\nand rays of light through the electrical discharges resulting when\r\nthe rarefied gases in the upper air are bombarded by electrified\r\nparticles shot forth from the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is our atmosphere, then, that we have to thank for all these\r\nbeautiful displays of color that delight our eyes and give pleasure\r\nto our existence, as well as for the very fact of our existence upon\r\na planet that without its presence would be an uninhabitable waste,\r\ncovered only with barren rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nKEEPING TRACK OF THE MOON\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all celestial objects the nearest and most familiar is our\r\nsatellite, the moon. Yet the mistakes and blunders that otherwise\r\nintelligent persons frequently make when they refer to the various\r\naspects of the moon are quite unbelievable.\r\n\r\nWho has not read in classics or in popular fiction of crescent moons\r\nriding high in midnight skies, of full moons rising above western\r\ncliffs or setting beyond eastern lakes? Who has not seen the moon\r\ndrawn in impossible positions with horns pointing toward the horizon,\r\nor a twinkling star shining through an apparently transparent moon?\r\n\r\nCareful observation of the moon in all its various phases and at\r\ndifferent seasons is the best method to be used in acquiring a\r\nknowledge of the elementary facts regarding the motion of the moon\r\nthrough the heavens from day to day, but that requires that one be up\r\noften after midnight and in the early hours preceding dawn and so it\r\nis that we feel so hazy in regard to what happens to the moon after\r\nit has passed the full.\r\n\r\nA few fundamental rules can be easily acquired, however, and these\r\nwill enable us to locate the moon in the right quarter of the\r\nheavens at any time of the day or night when we know its phase and\r\nthe approximate position of the sun at the same instant, and thus we\r\nmay avoid some of the most obvious blunders that are made in dealing\r\nwith the general aspect of the moon at any given time.\r\n\r\nAs can be verified by direct observation, the moon is always moving\r\ncontinually eastward. Since it makes a complete revolution around\r\nthe earth from new moon back to new moon again in a little less than\r\nthirty days, it passes over about twelve degrees a day (360° divided\r\nby 30), on the average, or one-half a degree an hour, which is about\r\nthe angular extent of its own diameter. Therefore every hour the\r\nmoon moves eastward a distance equal to its own diameter. This is of\r\ncourse only approximate as the moon moves more rapidly in some parts\r\nof its orbit than in others.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its real eastward motion the moon shares the apparent\r\ndaily westward motion of all celestial objects which is due to the\r\ndaily rotation of the earth on its axis in the opposite direction.\r\nThat is, the moon, as well as the sun, stars and planets, rises in\r\nthe east and sets in the west daily. On account of its continuous\r\neastward motion, however, the moon rises later every night, on\r\nthe average about fifty minutes, though the amount of this daily\r\nretardation of moon-rise varies from less than half an hour to\r\nconsiderably over an hour at different seasons of the year and in\r\ndifferent latitudes. In the course of a month then the moon has risen\r\nat all hours of the day and night and set at all hours of the day\r\nand night.\r\n\r\nIt might seem unnecessary to emphasize the fact that the moon always\r\nrises in the east were it not that the astronomer occasionally meets\r\nthe man who insists that he has at times seen the moon rise in the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nTo be sure the new crescent moon first becomes visible above the\r\nwestern horizon shortly after sunset though it rises in the east\r\nthe morning of the same day shortly after sunrise. As is also true\r\nof the sun the exact point on the horizon where the moon rises or\r\nsets varies from day to day and from season to season. In one month\r\nthe moon passes over very nearly the same path through the heavens\r\nthat the sun does in one year, for the moon's path is inclined only\r\nfive degrees to the ecliptic or apparent path of the sun through the\r\nheavens. It can never pass more than 28-1/2° (23-1/2° + 5°) south of\r\nthe celestial equator, nor more than 28-1/2° north of it. It has a\r\nslightly greater range in altitude than the sun, therefore. North of\r\n28-1/2° north latitude it always crosses the meridian south of the\r\nzenith and below 28-1/2° south latitude it crosses the meridian north\r\nof the zenith. In tropical regions the moon sometimes passes north of\r\nthe zenith, sometimes south, or again directly through the zenith.\r\n\r\nSince the full moon is always diametrically opposite to the sun it\r\npasses over nearly the same part of the heavens that the sun did six\r\nmonths before. In winter then when the sun is south of the equator\r\nthe moon \"rides high\" at night north of the equator and, vice versa,\r\nin summer when the sun is north of the equator the full moon \"rides\r\nlow\" south of the equator. In winter then we have more hours of\r\nmoonlight than we have in summer. This may be of no great advantage\r\nin mid-latitudes but we may imagine what a boon it is to the\r\ninhabitants of the Arctic and Antarctic regions to have the friendly\r\nmoon above the horizon during the long winter months when the sun is\r\nnever seen for days at a time.\r\n\r\nAt time of \"new\" moon the moon lies directly between us and the\r\nsun, but ordinarily passes just to the north or south of the\r\nsun since its orbit is inclined five degrees to the ecliptic or\r\nplane of the earth's orbit. If the moon's path lay exactly in the\r\necliptic we would have an eclipse of the sun every month at new\r\nmoon and an eclipse of the moon two weeks later at full moon. Now\r\nthe moon crosses the ecliptic twice a month, the points of crossing\r\nbeing called the nodes of its orbit, but only twice a year is the\r\nmoon nearly enough in line with the sun at the time it crosses to\r\ncause eclipses. Every year, then, there are two \"eclipse seasons,\"\r\nseparated by intervals of six months, when the moon is in line with\r\nthe sun at or close to the point where it crosses the ecliptic; then\r\nand only then can solar and lunar eclipses occur. The solar eclipses,\r\nof course, will occur when the moon is new, that is, when the moon\r\npasses directly between the earth and the sun and throws its shadow\r\nover the earth; and the lunar eclipses two weeks later when the earth\r\npasses between the sun and moon and throws its shadow over the face\r\nof the moon.\r\n\r\nProbably there is no astronomical subject that has been more\r\ngenerally misunderstood than that of solar and lunar eclipses. It\r\nis well to remember that solar eclipses can only occur at time of\r\nnew moon and lunar eclipses only at the time of full moon; and at\r\nthe time of eclipses, whether lunar or solar, the moon is at or near\r\nits nodes, the points where its orbit crosses the ecliptic. There\r\nare always at least two solar eclipses every year and there may be\r\nas many as five. There are years when there are no lunar eclipses,\r\nthough ordinarily both solar and lunar eclipses occur every year,\r\nsome partial others total.\r\n\r\nThe moon shines only by reflected sunlight. It is of itself a solid,\r\ndark body with its day surface intensely hot and its night surface\r\nintensely cold, a world of extreme temperatures.\r\n\r\nAt new moon all of the night side of the moon is turned toward us, at\r\nfull moon all of the day side. At other phases we see part of the day\r\nside and part of the night side and the illuminated side of the moon\r\nis always the side that is towards the sun. Failure to observe this\r\nsimple rule leads to many grievous blunders in depicting the moon.\r\n\r\nAt the time of new moon the moon, moving continually eastward, passes\r\nnorth or south of the sun from west to east except when it passes\r\ndirectly in front of the sun, causing eclipses. A day or so later\r\nthe waxing crescent moon or the \"new moon,\" as it is popularly\r\ncalled, becomes visible low in the west immediately after sunset. The\r\nmoon is now east of the sun and will remain east of the sun until the\r\ntime of full moon. During the period from new moon to full moon it\r\nwill, therefore, rise after the sun and set after the sun. The waxing\r\ncrescent moon will not be visible in the morning hours because,\r\ninasmuch as it rises after the sun, it is lost to view in the sun's\r\nbrilliant rays. Nevertheless, it follows the sun across the sky and\r\nbecomes visible in the west as soon as the sun has disappeared below\r\nthe western horizon. The thin illuminated crescent has its horns\r\nor cusps turned _away_ from the point where the sun has set. The\r\nhorns of the crescent can never point _toward_ the horizon since the\r\nilluminated side of the moon is always turned toward the sun whether\r\nthe sun is above or below our horizon.\r\n\r\nAs hour by hour and day by day the moon draws farther eastward and\r\nincreases its angular distance from the sun, more and more of the\r\nilluminated side becomes visible; the crescent increases in width and\r\narea and the moon appears higher in the western sky each night at\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nUsually about seven and a fraction days after the date of new moon\r\nthe moon completes the first quarter of its revolution around\r\nthe earth. The period from one phase to the next is variable and\r\nirregular, being sometimes less than seven days and at other times\r\nmore than eight days, since the moon does not move at a uniform rate\r\nin different parts of its orbit.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon has completed the first quarter of a revolution it\r\nis ninety degrees east of the sun and presents the phase known as\r\n\"half-moon\" since half of the surface that is turned toward the earth\r\nis illuminated and half is in darkness. It is said to be \"at the\r\nfirst quarter.\" The illuminated half is of course the western half\r\nbecause the sun is to the west of the moon. The half moon is near the\r\nmeridian at sunset and sets near midnight. Up to the first quarter,\r\nthen, the moon is a crescent in the western sky during the first part\r\nof the night and should never be represented as east of the meridian\r\nor near the meridian at midnight.\r\n\r\nAfter the moon has passed the first quarter and before it is full\r\nmore than half of the side turned toward the earth is illuminated and\r\nit is in the \"gibbous\" phase. It is still the western limb that is\r\nfully illuminated. The moon is now east of the meridian at sunset and\r\nit crosses the meridian before midnight and sets before sunrise. All\r\nwho are abroad during the first half of the night find this phase of\r\nthe moon more favorable to them than the gibbous phase following full\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThe moon now being above the horizon at sunset is visible\r\ncontinuously from sunset to midnight but sets some time during the\r\nsecond half of the night, while the full moon shines throughout\r\nthe night, rising in the east at sunset and setting in the west at\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\nWhen the moon is full it is 180° east, or west, of the sun and so\r\nboth its eastern and western limbs are perfectly illuminated. After\r\nthe full the moon goes through its phases in reverse order, being\r\nfirst gibbous, then a half-moon once more, and lastly a waning\r\ncrescent.\r\n\r\nIt is now west instead of east of the sun and so it is the eastern\r\nlimb that is fully illuminated by the sun. Being west of the sun it\r\nwill now rise before the sun and set before the sun, the interval\r\ndecreasing each day as the moon draws in toward the sun once more.\r\n\r\nThe gibbous phase preceding full moon is favorable to all abroad\r\nbefore midnight but the gibbous phase following full moon is more\r\nfavorable to those who are abroad after midnight, for from full moon\r\nto last quarter the moon is below the horizon at sunset, and of\r\ncourse, is rising later and later each night, while at sunrise it is\r\nstill above the horizon, appearing each day higher and higher above\r\nthe western horizon at sunrise as it approaches the third or last\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nWhen it has reached this point it is once more a half-moon, though\r\nnow it is the eastern half instead of the western half of the disk\r\nthat is fully illuminated. The moon is 90° west of the sun at third\r\nquarter and from this phase to the phase of new moon it is a crescent\r\nonce more, but now a waning instead of a waxing crescent. It appears\r\neast of the meridian before sunrise and as the crescent grows thinner\r\nit draws nearer and nearer to the eastern horizon and the rising sun.\r\nAs with the waxing crescent moon the horns are turned away from the\r\nhorizon. The waning crescent moon is always to be looked for east\r\nof the meridian and to be associated with the rising sun, while the\r\nwaxing crescent moon is to be looked for west of the meridian and\r\nassociated with the setting sun. Neither the waxing nor the waning\r\ncrescent moon will be visible during the midnight hours.\r\n\r\nAs the waning crescent moon grows thinner and draws in closer to\r\nthe sun each successive night, its time of rising precedes that of\r\nthe sun by an ever-decreasing interval until finally the crescent\r\ndisappears from view in the eastern sky; the next day we see no\r\ncrescent either in the eastern or western skies--the moon is once\r\nmore in conjunction with the sun and \"new.\" One revolution of the\r\nmoon about the earth with respect to the sun has been completed and\r\na day or so later we may look for a new crescent moon in the western\r\nsky after sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout three hundred and twenty years ago Giordano Bruno was burned\r\nat the stake for his audacity in believing in the existence of other\r\nworlds. A few decades later the famous astronomer Galileo was forced\r\nto publicly recant his belief that the earth moved. Yet the truth\r\ncould not long be suppressed by such means, and since those dark\r\ndays man's advance in knowledge has been so rapid that it seems\r\nto us today in this wonderful age of scientific discovery almost\r\ninconceivable that man ever believed that the earth, a tiny planet\r\nof a vast solar system, was \"the hub of the universe,\" the fixed and\r\nimmovable center about which revolved all the heavenly bodies. Very\r\nreluctantly, however, and with bitter feeling, but in the light of\r\noverwhelming evidence man finally gave up his long-cherished idea of\r\nterrestrial importance, and when finally forced to move his fixed\r\ncenter of the universe, he moved it only so far as the comparatively\r\nnearby sun.\r\n\r\nThis center he then regarded as fixed in space and also held to\r\nhis belief that the stars, set in an imaginary celestial sphere,\r\nwere immovable in space as well, and all at the same distance from\r\nthe sun. So, scarcely two hundred years ago we find that the\r\nastronomer Bradley was endeavoring to measure this common distance\r\nof the \"fixed stars.\" Though he failed in this attempt he made the\r\nimportant discovery that the observed positions of the stars are not\r\ntheir true positions, owing to the fact that the velocity of light is\r\nnot infinite but takes a definite finite interval of time to travel\r\na given distance. As a result the stars always appear displaced in\r\nthe direction of the earth's motion around the sun, the amount of\r\nthe displacement depending upon the velocity of the earth in its\r\norbit and the velocity of light. This \"aberration of light,\" as it is\r\ncalled, furnished additional proof that the earth revolves about the\r\nsun and was one more nail driven into the coffin of the old Ptolemaic\r\ntheory that the earth was the center of the universe. Bradley also\r\ndiscovered that the positions of the stars were affected by the\r\nwabbling of the earth's axis, called its \"nutation.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough in the days of Bradley neither the methods of observation\r\nnor the instruments were sufficiently accurate to show the minute\r\nshifts in the positions of the stars that reveal the individual\r\nmotions of the stars and the distances of those nearest to us, yet\r\nthe discovery of the two large displacements in the positions of all\r\nthe stars, due to the aberration of light and the nodding of the\r\nearth's axis were of the greatest value, for they were a necessary\r\nstep in the direction of the precise measurements of modern times. It\r\nis only through measurements of the greatest refinement and accuracy\r\nthat it is possible to detect the motions and distances of the stars\r\nand to discover the wonderful truths about the nature and structure\r\nof the universe that they are revealing to us today.\r\n\r\nAfter unsuccessful attempts extending over several centuries the\r\ndistance of one of the nearest stars, the faint 61 Cygni, as it is\r\ncatalogued, was finally determined by the astronomer Bessel in the\r\nyear 1838.\r\n\r\nThis star is about ten light-years distant from the earth, which\r\nplaces it about six hundred and thirty thousand times farther away\r\nfrom us than the sun; that is, we would have to travel six hundred\r\nand thirty thousand times the distance from the earth to the sun\r\nto reach this very close stellar neighbor, 61 Cygni. The _nearest_\r\nof all the stars, Alpha Centauri, is over two hundred and seventy\r\nthousand times the distance from the earth to the sun. It is,\r\ntherefore, little wonder that the early astronomers believed that the\r\nstars were fixed in space since even the nearest is so far away that,\r\nviewed from opposite points in the earth's orbit, its apparent change\r\nin position due to our actual change in position of 186,000,000\r\nmiles, amounts to only one and a half seconds of arc. Two stars\r\nseparated by _one hundred and sixty times_ this angular distance\r\nmight possibly be glimpsed as two distinct stars by a person with\r\ngood eyesight, though to most of us they would appear as one star.\r\nUpon the measurement of such minute angles depended a knowledge of\r\nthe distances of the nearest stars.\r\n\r\nIt is to Sir William Herschel that we owe the discovery, more than a\r\nhundred years ago, of the motion of the sun through the universe.\r\nFrom the consideration of a long series of observations of the\r\npositions of the stars this famous astronomer discovered that the\r\nstars in the direction of the constellation Hercules were separated\r\nby much greater angular distances than the stars diametrically\r\nopposite in the heavens. In other words, the stars were spreading\r\napart in one portion of the heavens and crowding together in the\r\nopposite direction and he rightly interpreted this to mean that the\r\nsun was moving in the direction of the constellation of Hercules.\r\nIt was not until the spectroscope was applied to the study of the\r\nheavens in the latter part of the nineteenth century that the amount\r\nof this motion of the sun was found to be about twelve and a half\r\nmiles per second, or four times the distance from the earth to the\r\nsun in a year.\r\n\r\nIt is to Sir William Herschel that we owe also the discovery of\r\nbinary systems of stars in which two stars swing around a point\r\nbetween them called their center of gravity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SPIRAL NEBULA IN CANES VENATICI\r\n  Taken with 60-inch Reflector of the Mt. Wilson Observatory]\r\n\r\nOur first conception of the immensity and grandeur of the universe\r\ndates from the time of the older Herschel only a century or so\r\nago. The mysterious nebulæ and star clusters were then discovered,\r\nthe wonders of the Milky Way were explored, and a new planet and\r\nsatellites in our own solar system were discovered. It was found that\r\nthe sun and the stars as well as the planets were in motion. Neither\r\nsun nor earth could be regarded any longer as a fixed point in the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nWith the application of the spectroscope to the study of the heavens\r\ntoward the end of the nineteenth century the key to a treasure-house\r\nof knowledge was placed in the hands of the astronomers of modern\r\ntimes and as a result we are now learning more, in a few decades,\r\nabout the wonders and mysteries of the heavens than was granted to\r\nman to learn in centuries of earlier endeavor. Yet it is the feeling\r\nof the astronomer of today that he is only standing on the threshold\r\nof knowledge and that the greatest of all discoveries, that of the\r\nnature of matter and of time and space is yet to be made.\r\n\r\nIt is the spectroscope that tells us so many wonderful facts about\r\nthe motions of the stars, nebulæ and star clusters. It tells us also\r\npractically all we know about the physical condition of our own sun\r\nand of the other suns of the universe, their temperature and age, and\r\nthe peculiarities of their atmospheres.\r\n\r\nSome of the most important astronomical discoveries that have been\r\nmade in the past few years have to do with the distribution and\r\nvelocities of the heavenly bodies as revealed by the spectroscope.\r\n\r\nIt has been found, with the aid of the spectroscope, that the most\r\nslowly moving of all stars are the extremely hot bluish Orion stars\r\nwith an average velocity of eight miles per second, while the\r\nmost rapidly moving stars are the deep-red stars with an average\r\nvelocity of twenty-one miles per second, and there is in all cases a\r\nrelationship existing between the color, or spectrum, of a star and\r\nits velocity. The reason for this connection between the two still\r\nremains undiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope has also told us some astonishing facts in recent\r\nyears about the velocities of the spiral nebulæ.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that these mysterious objects are moving with the\r\ntremendous average velocity of _four hundred and eighty miles per\r\nsecond_, which exceeds the average velocity of the stars fully\r\ntwenty-five fold. They possess, moreover, internal motions of\r\nrotation that are almost as high as their velocities through space.\r\nIt is now generally believed that spiral nebulæ are far distant\r\nobjects of enormous size and mass, exterior to our own system of\r\nstars and similar to it in form.\r\n\r\nIn place of the universe of the \"fixed stars\" and the immovable sun\r\nor earth of a few centuries ago we find that modern astronomical\r\ndiscovery is substituting a universe of inconceivable grandeur and\r\nimmensity in a state of ceaseless flux and change.\r\n\r\nOur earth--an atom spinning about on its axis and revolving rapidly\r\naround a huge sun that is equal in volume to more than a million\r\nearths--is carried onward with this sun through a vast universe of\r\nsuns.\r\n\r\nOnly an average-sized star among several hundred million other stars\r\nis this huge sun of ours, moving with its planet family through the\r\nregions of the Milky Way, where are to be found not only moving\r\nclusters and groups of stars, speeding along their way in obedience\r\nto the laws of motion of the system to which they belong, but also\r\nstrangely formed nebulæ covering vast stretches of space, whirling\r\nand seething internally and shining with mysterious light, and still\r\nother stretches of dark obscuring matter shutting off the rays of\r\nsuns beyond.\r\n\r\nThe extent and form of this enormous system of stars and nebulæ and\r\nthe laws that govern the motions of its individual members are among\r\nthe problems that the astronomers of today are attempting to solve.\r\nOn both sides of these regions of the Milky Way, wherein lies our\r\nown solar system, lie other vast systems, such as the globular star\r\nclusters, composed of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of\r\nsuns; the Magellanic clouds, which resemble detached portions of the\r\nMilky Way, and, probably, the much discussed spiral nebulæ, possible\r\n\"island universes\" similar to our own.\r\n\r\nWe have come far in the past three hundred years from the conception\r\nof an immovable earth at the center of the universe to this\r\nawe-inspiring conception of the universe that we have today, which is\r\nbased upon modern astronomical discoveries.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be discovered in the future in regard to the form and\r\nextent of the universe the idea of a fixed and immovable center\r\neither within the solar system or among the stars beyond has gone\r\nfrom the minds of men at last.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SPIRAL NEBULA IN ANDROMEDA VIEWED EDGEWISE\r\n  Taken with 60-inch Reflector of the Mt. Wilson Observatory]\r\n\r\nNot more than a generation ago a survival of the old idea of a\r\nfixed center was seen in the belief that Alcyone, in the Pleiades\r\nwas a \"central sun\" about which all the stars revolved. It is now\r\nwell known that the Pleiades form a moving star cluster. Alcyone is\r\ntherefore drifting slowly onward through the universe and the idea\r\nof a fixed and immovable center to which man may anchor his ideas is\r\ndrifting away also. There are, it is true, local centers of systems,\r\nsuch, for instance, as the sun occupies in the solar system or some\r\ngroup of stars may occupy in the stellar system to which our sun\r\nbelongs, yet _as a whole_ these systems move on and their centers\r\nwith them. There is no evidence today that any absolutely immovable\r\npoint exists in the heavens.\r\n\r\nNo celestial object has been found to be without the attribute of\r\n_motion_, not only motion _onward_ through the universe, but also\r\n_rotational_ motion about an axis of the body. The planets rotate on\r\ntheir axes as well as revolve about the sun, and the sun also turns\r\non its axis as it moves onward through space. This rotational motion\r\nis also found in the nebulæ and star clusters as well as in the stars\r\nand planets. No object in the heavens is known to be without it. Even\r\nthe slowly drifting Orion nebula possesses a rapid internal velocity\r\nof rotation. There is no such thing as a body absolutely at rest in\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE\r\n\r\n  Showing the number and relative size, velocity and distribution of the various types\r\n  of celestial objects.\r\n  ================+====================+=====================+===========+=====================\r\n                  |                    |                     |Velocities |\r\n      Object      |      Number        |     Diameter        |  miles    |   Distribution\r\n                  |                    |                     | per sec.  |\r\n  ----------------+--------------------+---------------------+-----------+---------------------\r\n  1.

There are red stars, yellow\r\nstars, white stars and bluish-white stars. There are the brilliant\r\nstars of first magnitude such as Vega, Capella and Antares, and\r\nthere are, on the other hand, stars so faint that they can barely be\r\nglimpsed with the most powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\nIn general the most brilliant stars are the nearest and the faintest\r\nstars are the most distant, but there are many exceptions to the\r\nrule, since there are stars that appear faint even when comparatively\r\nnear because they are small and shine with a feeble light. Such a\r\nstar is the faint, sixth-magnitude star, 61 Cygni, one of the nearest\r\nof all the stars. Again, there are stars in far-distant clusters\r\nvisible only in powerful telescopes that in actual brightness exceed\r\nour own sun several thousand times and in volume several million\r\ntimes. A star the size of the sun would be invisible in the most\r\npowerful telescope in existence if it were at the distance of many\r\nstars in the Milky Way or globular star clusters.\r\n\r\nStars differ in color because they differ in temperature. We are\r\nall aware of the fact that a piece of iron when heated first glows\r\na deep red, then appears yellowish in color and finally attains to\r\nwhite heat. It is the same among the stars. The red stars are the\r\ncoolest of all the stars and the bluish-white stars are the hottest\r\nof all the stars, while intermediate between them in temperature come\r\nthe yellow and the white stars.\r\n\r\nNow as the biologist and the geologist see in this world of ours\r\nsigns of evolution, or gradual development and change from the simple\r\nto the more complex forms, and of growth and decay, so the astronomer\r\nsees among the stars signs of a continuous, progressive development\r\nfrom one type of star to another. Stars share in the general\r\nevolution that is the law of the universe, and are born, reach the\r\nheight of their development, decline to old age and die.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few years important astronomical discoveries have\r\nbeen made that show the true order of this evolution of the stars. It\r\nwas believed not so long ago that the blue-white helium stars--the\r\ntype B stars the astronomers called them, or the Orion stars,\r\nsince there are so many stars of this type in the constellation of\r\nOrion--were not only the hottest but also the youngest of the stars\r\nand that they represented the first stage in the development of a\r\nstar from a primitive gaseous nebula such as the Great Orion Nebula.\r\nIt is now known that these brilliant, hot helium stars represent the\r\npeak of development of the most massive of all the stars and not the\r\nfirst stages in the development.\r\n\r\nA star, it is now known, comes into existence as a giant, reddish\r\nstar of enormous size and of a density only about one-thousandth that\r\nof the earth's atmosphere at sea-level. It is inconceivably tenuous\r\nor rare, and its temperature is comparatively low, about 3,000°\r\nCentigrade or less. It is not evolved from the luminous, gaseous\r\nnebulæ because red stars are never found associated with the gaseous\r\nnebulæ, as are the blue-white stars. The origin of these red giant\r\nstars is uncertain, but it is possible that they may be gradually\r\nevolved in some manner from the dark clouds of obscuring matter or\r\ndark nebulæ that exists so abundantly in the heavens.\r\n\r\nIn the next stage of its development the deep-red giant star\r\nincreases in temperature as it contracts under the action of\r\ngravitation and its color gradually changes from red to yellow. Its\r\ndensity increases slightly and its volume decreases. It is now a\r\nyellow giant star. As the evolution progresses in the course of ages\r\nthe star continues to contract, its temperature increases greatly as\r\ndoes also its density and it continues to decrease in volume. It is\r\nnow a brilliant white star, a hydrogen star, so called because its\r\nspectrum is chiefly characterized by the lines of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nAs the star contracts under the gravitation of its parts and\r\nincreases in temperature and density there comes more and more into\r\nplay an important factor that has a great effect upon its future\r\ndevelopment. This is light-pressure or radiation pressure which acts\r\nin opposition to gravity and exerts a strong outward pressure upon\r\nmatter within the depths of the star, tending to push it outward from\r\nthe center where the temperature is greatest and the light is most\r\nintense. It is a most interesting fact that if the mass of a star,\r\nthat is the quantity of matter that it contains, exceeds a certain\r\nvalue the pressure of light or radiation within it overbalances the\r\ngravitational attraction that draws matter towards its center and\r\nthe star disintegrates or ceases to exist as a star. This accounts\r\nfor the fact that the stars differ very little among themselves in\r\nthe quantity of matter that they contain, that is, in their masses,\r\nthough they may differ enormously in size. Stars that exceed a\r\ncertain mass will become unstable and this may account for the\r\nassociation of luminous nebulæ with the hottest of all stars, the\r\nnebulæ possibly being puffed off from the surfaces of these stars\r\nunder the action of radiation pressure.\r\n\r\nAfter a star has reached the height of its development as a\r\nbluish-white helium star with a temperature of something like 10,000°\r\nCentigrade and a density about one-tenth that of the sun, it begins\r\nto lose heat and to cool gradually though it continues to contract\r\nand increase in density.\r\n\r\nIt is now on the descending scale of evolution and is to be counted\r\namong the dwarfs instead of the giants. A brilliant blue-white helium\r\nor Orion star is about one hundred times more luminous than the sun,\r\nand its diameter is about ten times that of the sun.\r\n\r\nOur own sun, we find, is on the descending scale of stellar\r\nevolution. It is a yellow dwarf star of temperature about 6,000°\r\nCentigrade and density one and one-fourth that of water, which is\r\nprobably about as great a density as is attained by any star since\r\neven the non-luminous planets Jupiter and Saturn have lower densities\r\nthan the sun.\r\n\r\nThe last stage in the development of a star is represented by the\r\ndwarf red star of high density and low temperature. The diameter of\r\nthe dwarf red star probably averages about five hundred thousand\r\nmiles and its temperature is 3,000° Centigrade or less. After this\r\nwe have the extinct stars, similar possibly to our planet Jupiter,\r\nthough considerably larger, with a dense gaseous atmosphere and a\r\ncertain degree of internal heat.\r\n\r\nWe have traced the evolution of a star from a red giant to a red\r\ndwarf through the intermediate stages from yellow giant to a giant\r\nhelium star with increasing temperature and thence to yellow dwarf\r\nand red dwarf as the temperature decreases. Only the most massive\r\nstars pass through this entire chain of evolution. Stars of small\r\nmass never attain to the splendor of brilliant blue-white helium\r\nstars, but begin to decrease in temperature and brightness before\r\nthis stage is reached.\r\n\r\nThe time required for the evolution of a star from red giant to red\r\ndwarf is not known, but it must be very great. The age of the earth,\r\nwhich is probably equal to that of the solar system, is estimated as\r\nsomething like one thousand million years. It is probable that the\r\naverage life of a star far exceeds this limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nDOUBLE AND MULTIPLE STARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plan of the solar system which consists of a central sun\r\nencircled by satellites that are far inferior to their luminary\r\nin size, and that move about it in orbits that are almost perfect\r\ncircles, is not the only, nor possibly, even the most general one in\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\nSweeping the heavens with powerful telescopes one is astonished\r\nto find that myriads of stars can be separated into two or more\r\nphysically connected suns that are often, moreover, of exquisitely\r\ntinted and contrasting shades. Green and red, orange and blue, white\r\nand golden or white and blue pairs exist in profusion, and strange to\r\nsay there are well-authenticated instances of color changes taking\r\nplace temporarily within the same system. A pair of white stars has\r\nbeen known to change within a few decades, first to golden yellow and\r\nbluish green and then to orange and green. The famous pair catalogued\r\nas \"95 Herculis\" was noted to change from green and red to a palish\r\nyellow and back to the original strongly contrasting hues within\r\nthe course of a single year, while at another time they appeared to\r\nbe a perfectly white pair. At the present time both of these stars\r\nare decidedly yellowish in color. Such changes in hue are probably\r\ndue to temporary disturbances in the atmospheres of the stars,\r\npossibly of an electrical nature or to sudden or unusual outbursts of\r\nactivity, concerning the origin of which we are as much in doubt as\r\nwe are of the cause of the sun-spot cycle and periodic variation in\r\nthe intensity of radiation of our own sun. Temporary changes in the\r\ncolor of the components of double star systems sometimes take place\r\nwhen the two stars approach their \"periastron\" or point of nearest\r\napproach. Owing to the great eccentricity of the orbits of double\r\nstars, such stars are anywhere from twice to nineteen times as near\r\nto each other at periastron as they are at \"apastron,\" or point of\r\ngreatest departure. Such great changes in the relative distances\r\nof two physically connected suns would produce marked changes in\r\nthe intensity of the tides raised upon each of them by their mutual\r\ngravitational attraction and unusual outbursts of gases or electrical\r\nexcitement in the atmospheres of the stars might cause very\r\nnoticeable changes in the color of these stars as they drew nearer to\r\neach other, which would subside as they receded toward apastron.\r\n\r\nIn addition to \"visual\" double or multiple stars, there exists a very\r\nextensive class of stars known as \"spectroscopic binaries,\" in which\r\nthe two components are so close to each other that even the most\r\npowerful telescopes cannot divide them. It is only from the shifting\r\nof the lines of their overlapping spectra, caused by their alternate\r\nmotion toward and from the earth as they revolve about their common\r\ncenter of gravity, that their duplex nature is revealed to us.\r\n\r\nIn some instances one member of the system is so faint that its\r\nspectrum is not visible and its presence is disclosed only by the\r\nshifting of the lines of the bright star.\r\n\r\nAccording to Doppler's Law, when a star is approaching the earth the\r\nlines of its spectrum shift toward the blue end of the spectrum,\r\nand when the star is receding from the earth the lines are shifted\r\ntoward the red end of the spectrum. The amount of this shift can\r\nbe very accurately measured, and gives the relative velocities of\r\nthe stars in their orbits directly in miles per second. Knowing in\r\naddition, by observation, the period of mutual revolution of the\r\nstars, it is possible to find the dimensions of these spectroscopic\r\nbinary systems compared to our own solar system, and also the masses\r\nof the stars compared to the mass of our own sun. If the spectrum of\r\nthe fainter star is not visible, only the velocity of the brighter\r\nstar with respect to the center of gravity of the system can be\r\nfound and the mass found for the system comes out too small. In such\r\ncases we can obtain only a lower limit for the mass of the system.\r\nThen, too, it must be remembered that these systems of stars lie at\r\nall angles with reference to our line of sight, and so we rarely\r\nsee the orbits in their true form. The measured velocities are as a\r\nresult smaller than the true velocities, and on the average amount to\r\nonly sixty per cent. of the true orbital velocities. The calculated\r\nmasses of spectroscopic binary stars are, therefore, in general only\r\nabout sixty per cent. of the true masses. It has been found from\r\ncalculating the masses of a number of binary systems, that the\r\ncombined masses of the stars in these systems do not differ very\r\ngreatly among themselves, nor as compared to our own sun, though in\r\nlight-giving power these stars may differ hundreds, thousands, even\r\nmillions of times. For instance, there are stars that give only one\r\nten-thousandth part of the light of our own sun, and other stars that\r\ngive ten thousand times as much light as the sun. Moreover, there\r\nare many instances of physically connected stars differing thousands\r\nof times in luminosity, though in mass, or quantity of matter found\r\nin the stars, they differ only two or three times. Why this is so\r\nremains one of the great mysteries of the heavens, and makes it\r\nextremely difficult to give any satisfactory theory of the origin\r\nof double-star systems. It has never been explained satisfactorily\r\nwhy of two suns physically connected and, therefore, presumably\r\noriginating at the same time, one should be radiating with the\r\ngreatest intensity, while the other is practically an extinct sun,\r\nin spite of the fact that the quantity of matter in the two bodies\r\ndiffers but slightly.\r\n\r\nIn a few systems the plane in which the stars revolve passes so\r\nnearly through the earth that the two stars temporarily eclipse one\r\nanother during each revolution. Such systems are called _eclipsing\r\nbinaries_. To such a system belongs the famous _Algol_. Its light\r\nwaxes and wanes periodically with the greatest punctuality in a\r\nperiod of 2^d 20^h 48.9^m, owing to its temporary eclipse by a very\r\nlarge but extremely faint attendant sun. The diameter of the faint\r\nstar is slightly greater than the diameter of the bright star\r\nwhich is about one million miles in extent. The distance between\r\nthe _centers_ of the stars is only about three million miles, which\r\nbrings their surfaces within two million miles of each other. The\r\nmasses of the two stars are in the ratio of two to one, the brighter\r\nand more massive star being about half as heavy as our own sun,\r\nthough its density is only about two-tenths that of the sun. The\r\ndensity of the fainter star is still less, being only about half\r\nthat of the brighter star. Very low density of both components and\r\nextreme faintness of one member compared to the other, appears to be\r\na very general characteristic of closely associated eclipsing and\r\nspectroscopic binary stars. Among the extremely hot and brilliant\r\nhelium and hydrogen stars, spectroscopic binaries exist in great\r\nnumbers. In fact, among these types there appear to be as many binary\r\nand multiple systems as there are systems of isolated suns. Sometimes\r\nthese close binary stars are egg-shaped or oval and revolve rapidly\r\nalmost in contact about their common center of gravity. Inhabitants\r\nof satellites of such a system would see in their heavens the, to us,\r\nstrange and startling phenomenon of _two_ suns, each equal to our\r\nown or even greater in size, whirling rapidly about each other and\r\nseparated by a space comparable in extent to their own diameters.\r\nEclipses in such a system would be of daily occurrence, and, if\r\none star were dark, would produce for the satellite world the same\r\neffect of alternate day and night that results from axial rotation\r\nof a satellite. The two hemispheres of the faint companion sun\r\nwould be very unequally illuminated owing to the fact that the side\r\nturned toward the brilliant sun would always reflect its neighbor's\r\nbrightness in addition to shining with its own comparatively feeble\r\ninherent light, while the opposite hemisphere would shine only by its\r\nown dim light, and would, therefore, be in comparative darkness.\r\n\r\nThe spectroscopic binaries generally revolve closely and rapidly\r\nabout their common center of gravity; there are to be found, on the\r\nother hand, among the wider visual doubles, many systems wherein the\r\ncomponents are separated by distances comparable to the distances of\r\nthe outer planets, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, from the sun. It is\r\nevident that the individual stars of such binary systems could not\r\npossibly be encircled by any such extensive system of satellites as\r\nattends our own sun, though satellites such as our own planet Earth,\r\nor the inferior planets Mercury and Venus, might conceivably encircle\r\nthe individual components of such binary systems at distances not\r\ngreater than that of the earth from the sun. No planet could safely\r\nexist at a much greater distance from one of these suns without being\r\nsubject to most dangerous perturbations and disruptive tidal forces\r\narising from the vicinity of the second sun. Granted that planets\r\nmight encircle one of these suns at a distance approximating that of\r\nVenus or our own planet from the sun, the inhabitants of such worlds\r\nwould behold the strange phenomenon of _two_ suns in the heavens,\r\nnot almost in contact as in spectroscopic binary systems, but at\r\none time comparatively near and again in opposite portions of the\r\nheavens as is the case with the sun and moon in our own heavens. As\r\nthe planet advanced in its orbit about the ruling sun, the secondary\r\nsun would be visible at first by day and again by night. If the two\r\nsuns were of contrasting hues, as, for instance, green and red, there\r\nmight appear in the nearby heavens at a distance of one hundred\r\nmillion miles or so a magnificent sun of deep reddish hue, equal to\r\nor surpassing our own in splendor, while in a far distant part of\r\nthe sky, at a distance as great as that which separates us from the\r\nplanet Saturn, might appear a rival sun of greenish hue, smaller and\r\nfainter, but nevertheless, hot and extremely brilliant and capable of\r\nexerting through its great gravitational attraction a most disturbing\r\neffect upon the motion of the planet of its neighbor. At times the\r\nrays of the two suns, red and green, would combine to produce a day\r\ncharacterized by terrific heat and intense illumination. Again the\r\ngreen orb would rise in the east as the red sun set in the west and\r\nnight would be turned into a weird, dimly-lighted day by the greenish\r\nrays of the secondary sun. Compared to the wonders and beauties of\r\nthe heavens in such a system, our own well-regulated and orderly\r\nplanet family, undisturbed by the exciting proximity of a rival sun,\r\nseems to pale into insignificance. Yet we have every good reason to\r\nbe content with the ordering of affairs within our own solar system,\r\nand to feel relief rather than regret at the absence of a secondary\r\nsun. In a planet world revolving about one member of a double star\r\nsystem, we may imagine the dread rather than pleasure with which the\r\nperiodic near-approach of a rival sun would be hailed, and even the\r\npossible hurried migration from exposed to sheltered portions of the\r\nplanetary world to escape the rapidly increasing heat and intensity\r\nof light from the approaching sun. In such systems the coming and\r\ngoing of the seasons might indeed be a matter of life and death to\r\nthe inhabitants of satellite worlds!\r\n\r\nWithin our solar system the masses of the planets are practically\r\nnegligible compared to the mass of the sun, and it is for this reason\r\nthat they appear to revolve about the _center_ of the sun. As a\r\nmatter of fact, no body in the universe revolves about the _exact\r\ngeometrical center_ of another body, but two mutually attracting\r\nbodies revolve in orbits about their common center of gravity, which\r\nalways lies between the two bodies on the line connecting them and\r\nat a distance from each of them that is in inverse proportion to the\r\nmass of the body. The moon does not revolve about the _center of the\r\nearth_, but about the _center of gravity_ of the earth and moon,\r\nwhich lies on the line connecting the two bodies and at a distance\r\nfrom the earth's center that is one eighty-first of the distance\r\nfrom the center of the earth to the center of the moon, since this\r\nrepresents the ratio of the masses of the two bodies. This center\r\nof gravity of the earth and moon, lies, then, about two thousand\r\nmiles from the earth's center, and about this point both earth and\r\nmoon trace out orbits of revolution that are identical in form and\r\ndiffer only in size. In the same way each of the planets of the\r\nsolar system revolves about the center of gravity of itself and the\r\nsun, but the mass of the sun is so far in excess of the combined\r\nmasses of all the planets that we may consider, for all practical\r\npurposes, that the planets revolve about the sun's center, the center\r\nof gravity of the system being within the sun, just as the center of\r\ngravity of the earth and moon is within the earth.\r\n\r\nProf. T. J. J. See found from the investigation of forty binary star\r\norbits that the average eccentricity of double star orbits is twelve\r\ntimes as great as the average eccentricity of a planetary orbit, and\r\nthat the masses of the component suns never differ very greatly. The\r\ncenter of gravity of a binary system, therefore, lies at a great\r\ndistance from the centers of the stars, and about this point, as a\r\nfocus, the stars move in orbits that are exactly similar in form but\r\ndiffer in size in inverse proportion to the ratio of the masses.\r\nSince the orbits of binaries are, moreover, very highly eccentric,\r\nthe two suns are, as we have said, anywhere from two to nineteen\r\ntimes nearer to each other at periastron than they are at \"apastron.\"\r\n\r\nWe have spoken so far only of systems of two associated suns, but\r\nmany systems exist in which three or more sun-like bodies are in\r\nrevolution about a common center of gravity. Frequently two fairly\r\nclose suns are in revolution about a common center of gravity, in a\r\nperiod, say, of fifty or sixty years, while a third sun revolves at\r\na comparatively great distance about the center of gravity of itself\r\nand the first pair in a period of several hundred years. Or possibly\r\nthe third sun also possesses a close attendant and the two pairs\r\nrevolve in a period of great length about a common center of gravity.\r\n\r\nSuch, for instance, are the systems of _Zeta Cancri_ and _Epsilon\r\nLyræ_. In the former system the closer components revolve rapidly\r\nabout their center of gravity in a period of about sixty years, while\r\nthe remote companion shows irregularities in its motion that indicate\r\nthat it is revolving about a dark body in a period of seventeen and\r\na half years, while the two together are revolving very slowly in a\r\nperiod of six or seven centuries, about a common center of gravity\r\nwith the first pair in a retrograde direction.\r\n\r\nThe wider pair of _Epsilon Lyræ_ is a naked-eye double for it can\r\nbe seen as a double star by a keen eye, while even a three-inch\r\ntelescope will separate each of the components into a double star. So\r\nextensive is this system that the periods of revolution of the closer\r\ncomponents occupy several centuries, one pair appearing to revolve\r\nabout twice as rapidly as the other, while the period of revolution\r\nof the two pairs about a common center is probably a matter of\r\nthousands of years. The gap that separates the two pairs may be so\r\ngreat that light requires months to cross it.\r\n\r\nThese multiple systems are by no means exceptional. They are to be\r\nfound in profusion among the brilliant _Orion_ stars. They have been\r\nreferred to as \"knots\" of stars and it has been suggested that they\r\nmay have originated as local condensations in one vast nebulous\r\ntract. A system of only two components appears to be the exception\r\nrather than the rule, groups of several connected suns being more\r\nnumerous than single pairs.\r\n\r\nIn all of these double and multiple systems there exists the\r\npossibility of minute satellites, such as our own earth, in\r\nattendance upon some one component of the system. Such tiny bodies\r\nshining only by reflected light from a nearby brilliant sun would be\r\nhopelessly invisible in the most powerful telescope.\r\n\r\nWe can only assume that it is far more reasonable to believe in than\r\nto disprove the existence of such satellites.\r\n\r\nOur own solar system, then, represents neither in its mechanical nor\r\nphysical features, the only possibilities for the maintenance of\r\nlife; it can neither be considered a unique form, nor even the most\r\ngenerally prevalent form in the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL DISTANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the scale upon which the visible universe is\r\nfashioned lies almost beyond human comprehension. In measuring the\r\nvast extent of our own solar system, which is but a single unit\r\nin the system of the stars, we may have recourse to some earthly\r\nstandard of measurement, such as the mile. But when we desire to\r\nexpress in terms of units that can be grasped by our imagination, the\r\ndistances of the stars that lie far, far beyond, we find that all\r\nordinary standards of measurement become utterly inadequate for our\r\npurpose. In the measurement of celestial distances within the solar\r\nsystem the unit employed is either the familiar mile or kilometer or\r\nthe \"astronomical unit,\" which is the mean distance from the earth\r\nto the sun (ninety-two million nine hundred thousand miles in round\r\nnumbers).\r\n\r\nIn the measurement of distances _beyond_ the solar system the unit\r\nemployed is either the _light-year_ or more recently the _parsec_,\r\nwhich is rapidly replacing the light-year among astronomers. A\r\n\"light-year\" is the distance that light, with its finite but almost\r\nunimaginable velocity of one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles\r\n_per second, travels in a year_. It is equal in round numbers to\r\nsixty-three thousand times the distance from the earth to the sun or\r\napproximately six thousand billions of miles. The parsec is equal\r\nto three and twenty-six hundredths (3.26) light-years, and it is\r\napproximately two hundred thousand times the distance from the earth\r\nto the sun. It is \"the distance of a star with the _parallax_ of\r\na second,\" a fact which its name, parsec, conveys to us. In other\r\nwords, at the distance of one parsec the distance from the earth to\r\nthe sun, \"the astronomical unit,\" would subtend an angle equal to\r\none second of an arc. This angle is spoken of as the parallax of the\r\nstar. The larger the parallax, that is, the larger the angle the\r\nastronomical unit or radius of the earth's orbit subtends, viewed\r\nfrom the star, the nearer the star is to us. The fact that there is\r\nno known star within one parsec, or three and twenty-six hundredths\r\nlight-years, of the sun shows the immensity of the scale of the\r\nuniverse of stars.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the distances of the stars and the extent of the\r\nsidereal system of which our sun and his satellites form a part, let\r\nus undertake to express the distance of the sun, moon and planets\r\nfrom the earth and the extent of the solar system in terms with which\r\nwe are familiar.\r\n\r\nThe nearest to the earth of all celestial bodies is its satellite,\r\nthe moon. So near is the moon that if we should make on some great\r\nplain a model of the solar system in which the astronomical unit, the\r\ndistance from earth to sun, would be four hundred feet, the distance\r\nbetween the earth and moon would be only one foot. On the same scale\r\nthe most distant planet Neptune would be two and one-quarter miles\r\naway.\r\n\r\nGranted that it were possible to escape the earth's gravitational\r\nbonds and to travel by our swiftest means of conveyance, the\r\nairplane, through interplanetary space, let us consider how long\r\nit would take us to reach the moon, sun and planets if our speed\r\nwere maintained at a uniform rate of two hundred miles an hour. An\r\nairplane traveling at this rate would circumnavigate the earth in a\r\nlittle over five days and would reach the moon in seven weeks. A trip\r\nto the sun, however, would take fifty-three years.\r\n\r\nAfter traveling for fourteen and a fraction years we would pass\r\nthe orbit of Venus and eighteen years later the orbit of Mercury.\r\nIf we preferred to travel outward from the earth in the direction\r\nof Mars and the outer planets instead of toward the sun, more than\r\ntwenty-seven years would elapse before we would reach the orbit of\r\nMars. An airplane journey to Jupiter would be a matter of more than\r\ntwo hundred years, to Saturn four hundred and fifty years, to Uranus\r\nnearly one thousand years, and to Neptune, about one thousand five\r\nhundred years. To cross the solar system on the diameter of Neptune's\r\norbit in an airplane, traveling day and night without stopping at the\r\nrate of 200 miles per hour would take more than three thousand years.\r\nThe sun's attraction reaches far beyond Neptune's orbit, however.\r\nThere are comets belonging to the solar system compelled by the sun's\r\nattraction to accompany him on his travels through space that return\r\nperiodically to the immediate vicinity of the sun from regions far\r\nbeyond the orbit of Neptune and there is also the possibility that\r\none or more undiscovered planets may travel around the sun in orbits\r\nfar exterior to Neptune's orbit.\r\n\r\nMeasured in terms of familiar units, such as are employed for the\r\nmeasurement of distances on our own planet, the extent of the solar\r\nsystem is tremendously great. Viewed from Neptune, the sun is so\r\nfar away that it presents no appreciable disk. It is in this sense\r\nstar-like to the Neptunians, but at the distance of Neptune the stars\r\nappear no more brilliant and no nearer than they do to us.\r\n\r\nTo Neptune the sun, though star-like in form, supplies a very\r\nappreciable quantity of light and heat (one nine-hundredth of the\r\namount the earth receives) while the amount of light and heat that\r\nNeptune receives from the nearest stars is entirely inappreciable.\r\nWhen our airplane reaches Neptune after a journey of one thousand\r\nfive hundred years, it is, as it were, just clearing the ground\r\nfor its flight to the stars. To cover the intervening space to\r\nthe nearest star, traveled by light in four and a third years, an\r\nairplane would need _fourteen and a half million years_. In that time\r\nthe solar system itself would be in some far distant part of the\r\nuniverse, since it is speeding onward through space at the rate of\r\ntwelve miles a second or about four astronomical units a year.\r\n\r\nChanging now our unit of measurement that we may express interstellar\r\ndistances in comprehensible numbers, we prepare to travel from the\r\nearth to the stars with the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nWith this velocity, one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles per\r\nsecond, we circumnavigate our globe in one-seventh of a second, reach\r\nthe moon in one and a fourth seconds and the sun in eight minutes.\r\nIn a little over four hours we pass the orbit of Neptune and are\r\nstarted on our journey to the stars, penetrating further and further\r\ninto interstellar space. For a year we travel and reach not a single\r\nstar though we are speeding ever onward with the velocity of light.\r\nWe have now covered the distance of one light-year, which means that\r\nthe waves of light from the sun we have left behind must travel for a\r\nyear before they reach us. We continue our journey and find ourselves\r\nnext at a distance of one parsec from the sun. We have traveled a\r\ndistance of approximately three and a quarter light-years, and were\r\nit possible to see the earth as well as the sun at this distance,\r\nthe two would appear to be but one second of arc apart, a distance\r\nthat requires the most careful adjustment and manipulation of the\r\ntelescope to measure accurately. We are still one light-year distant\r\nfrom Alpha Centauri, the nearest of the bright stars. A few of the\r\nstars will now appear somewhat brighter than they appeared to us on\r\nearth, but the majority of the stars appear just as we see them here\r\nand the forms of the constellations remain practically unchanged\r\nin appearance, for we are only beginning our journey through the\r\nsidereal universe and our position in it has only shifted by a very\r\nslight amount. If we should continue our journey to the immediate\r\nvicinity of Alpha Centauri, we would find that it is not like our\r\nown sun, a single star, but is a binary star consisting of two suns\r\nin revolution around their common center of gravity. The distance\r\nof this binary system from the solar system has been measured\r\nwith considerable accuracy and is known to be four and a third\r\nlight-years. Though there may be a few faint stars or non-luminous\r\nstars nearer to us than Alpha Centauri, this star has long held the\r\ndistinction of being the nearest of the stars. As the sun continues\r\nhis journey through the universe the two stars, Alpha Centauri and\r\nour sun, will finally draw away from each other after many ages have\r\npassed and some other sun of space will be our nearest star. The\r\ndistances that separate the stars from each other probably average as\r\ngreat as the distance from the sun to Alpha Centauri. Within a sphere\r\nwhose center is at the earth and whose radius is five parsecs, or\r\nabout sixteen light-years, there are only about twenty known stars.\r\nThere is, therefore, small chance of collision among bodies that are\r\nso small in proportion to the tremendous intervals of space that\r\nseparate them from each other. There is ample room for the individual\r\nstars to pursue their journey through space without interfering with\r\neach other's motion so long as they are as widely scattered as they\r\nappear to be in this portion of the universe. The fact that our own\r\nsun has continued its journey through the universe for some hundreds\r\nof millions of years without any catastrophe such as would result\r\nfrom closely approaching or colliding with another sun of space shows\r\nhow enormous is the scale upon which our sidereal system is fashioned.\r\n\r\nStars that are ten, fifty or even one hundred light-years from the\r\nearth are our nearest neighbors in space. They are the stars that\r\nshow a slight displacement in the heavens or measurable parallax,\r\nviewed from opposite sides of the earth's orbit. There are probably a\r\nthousand stars among the hundreds of millions of stars within reach\r\nof the greatest telescopes whose distances have been determined\r\nin light-years by direct measurement of their displacement in the\r\nheavens resulting from the change of position of the earth in its\r\norbit. The most distant of the stars are apparently immovable in\r\nthe heavens showing neither the effect of the sun's motion or their\r\nown motion through space. Methods for finding the distances of many\r\nfar remote stars and star-clusters have been devised, however, and\r\nsome comparatively recent investigations have given results for the\r\ndistances of these objects indicating that the diameter of the system\r\nof stars to which our sun belongs is approximately three hundred\r\nthousand light-years. It is difficult to grasp the full significance\r\nof this fact. It means that hundreds of millions of the suns of space\r\nthrong the visible universe at distances from us and from each other\r\nrunning into hundreds, thousands and even hundreds of thousands of\r\nlight-years. The light waves from some tiny object that we view\r\ntoday in one of our great reflectors may have started on their\r\njourney through space over one hundred thousand years ago when men of\r\nthe Old Stone Age inhabited our planet earth!\r\n\r\nAstronomers have found as a result of their investigations that the\r\nsidereal system to which our solar system belongs is in the form of\r\na flattened spheroid with its longest axis in the plane of the Milky\r\nWay. The extent of this star system composed of hundreds of millions\r\nof individual suns in addition to nebulæ and clusters is probably\r\nsomething like three hundred thousand light-years along its longest\r\naxis, while globular star clusters lying above and below its central\r\nplane are estimated to be at distances from it ranging from ten\r\nthousand to two hundred thousand light-years. This entire organized\r\nsystem is our sidereal universe. Space beyond is unexplored. The\r\nglobular star clusters are among the most distant celestial objects\r\nso far discovered. The spiral nebulæ may be entirely within the\r\nlimits of this system or they may be even more distant than the\r\nglobular clusters for their distances are not known as yet.\r\n\r\nThere is a possibility that our sidereal universe, vast as it is\r\nknown to be, may be but a unit in some still greater unit and that\r\nother similar systems lie beyond the reach of existing telescopes at\r\nunimaginable distances.\r\n\r\nThe mind of man is overwhelmed by the thought of sidereal systems\r\nas vast as our own lying far beyond his ken. Whether or not such\r\nexternal systems do exist and are with our own sidereal system units\r\nin some still vaster creation we cannot know.\r\n\r\nSo vast, indeed, is this one visible universe of ours that the\r\nmind of man, accustomed to earthly standards, cannot comprehend\r\nits magnitude or the infinitesimal size of our whole solar system\r\ncompared to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nSOME ASTRONOMICAL FACTS WORTH REMEMBERING\r\n\r\n\r\nKepler's Three Laws of Planetary Motion:\r\n\r\nI. The planets move in ellipses with the sun at one focus.\r\n\r\nII. The radius vector of a planet (line adjoining sun and planet)\r\nsweeps over equal areas in equal times.\r\n\r\nIII. The square of the time of revolution (the year) of each planet\r\nis proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton discovered that the law of gravitation extends to\r\nthe stars. That is, every mass in the universe attracts every other\r\nmass with an attraction directly proportional to the product of the\r\nmasses and inversely proportional to the square of the distances\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOcean tides are caused by the difference between the attraction of\r\nthe sun and moon for the main body of the earth and their attraction\r\nfor different particles of the earth's surface. The tide-raising\r\nforce of the disturbing body is proportional to its mass and\r\ninversely proportional to the cube of its distance. The tides\r\nproduced by the sun are, therefore, only two-fifths as great as the\r\ntides produced by the moon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of infinite radius,\r\nwith the earth at its center, upon which the celestial bodies are\r\nconsidered to be projected for convenience in determining their\r\npositions with respect to fixed points of reference in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe north and south poles of the heavens are the points on the\r\ncelestial sphere directly above the north and south poles of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThe celestial equator is the great circle in which the plane of the\r\nearth's equator intersects the celestial sphere. It passes through\r\nthe east and west points of the horizon and through the zenith--or\r\npoint directly overhead--at the earth's equator.\r\n\r\nThe ecliptic is the great circle in which the plane of the earth's\r\norbit intersects the celestial sphere. The celestial equator and the\r\necliptic are inclined to each other at an angle of 23-1/2°, which is\r\ncalled the obliquity of the ecliptic. The two points in which the\r\ncelestial equator and the ecliptic intersect are called respectively\r\nthe vernal equinox and the autumnal equinox.\r\n\r\nThe vernal equinox is an important point of reference on the\r\ncelestial sphere.\r\n\r\nAs the position of a point on the earth's surface is determined\r\nby its longitude and latitude so the position of an object on the\r\ncelestial sphere--star, sun, planet--is determined by its Right\r\nAscension and Declination.\r\n\r\nThe Declination of a celestial object is its distance north or\r\nsouth of the celestial equator, measured in degrees, minutes and\r\nseconds of arc, on a great circle of the celestial sphere passing\r\nthrough the object and north and south poles of the heavens. These\r\ngreat circles are called hour circles and they correspond to the\r\nmeridians or circles of longitude on the earth's surface. The\r\ndeclination of an object in the heavens corresponds to the latitude\r\nof a point on the earth's surface. The Right Ascension of a point\r\non the celestial sphere corresponds to the longitude of a point on\r\nthe earth's surface. It is measured--as longitude is measured--in\r\ndegrees, minutes and seconds of arc or in hours, minutes and seconds\r\nof time--eastward along the celestial equator from the hour circle\r\npassing through the vernal equinox to the foot of the hour circle\r\npassing through the object. The hour circle passing through the\r\nvernal equinox is the zero meridian for the celestial sphere just as\r\nthe meridian of Greenwich is the zero meridian on the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of the earth from the sun is 92,900,000 miles and\r\nis called the astronomical unit.\r\n\r\nThe sun with its satellites advances through the universe at the rate\r\nof 4 astronomical units in a year or approximately one million miles\r\na day.\r\n\r\nThe parallax of a star is the angle at the star subtended by the\r\nradius of the earth's orbit, 92,900,000 miles, or the astronomical\r\nunit. It is, in other words, the angular distance between the earth\r\nand sun as viewed from the star. The larger the parallax the nearer\r\nthe star. The largest known stellar parallax is that of Alpha\r\nCentauri and its value is 0\".75.\r\n\r\nThe light-year is the distance that light travels in one year. It\r\nis equal to about 63,000 astronomical units or nearly six trillion\r\n(6,000,000,000,000) miles. The velocity of light is 186,000 miles per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nThe parsec is equal to 3.26 light-years. It is the distance of a star\r\nthat has a parallax of one second of arc.\r\n\r\nThe apparent magnitude of a star is its apparent brightness estimated\r\non a scale in which a difference of one magnitude corresponds to a\r\ndifference in brightness of 2.51, or the fifth root of one hundred.\r\nA difference of five magnitudes corresponds to a difference one one\r\nhundredfold in brightness, of ten magnitudes to ten thousandfold\r\nin brightness. In exact measurements on this scale magnitudes are\r\nestimated to tenths.\r\n\r\nStars that are one magnitude brighter than stars of the standard\r\nfirst magnitude are of the zero magnitude and stars still brighter\r\nare of negative magnitudes.\r\n\r\nSirius is a star of the -1.6 magnitude. Jupiter at opposition is of\r\n-2.0 magnitude and Venus at greatest brilliancy of -4.0 magnitude.\r\nThe sun on this scale of comparative brightness is of the -26.7\r\napparent magnitude. The faintest stars visible in the most powerful\r\ntelescope in the world--the 101-inch Mt. Wilson Hooker telescope--are\r\nof the twentieth magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe _absolute_ magnitude of a star is its apparent magnitude at\r\nthe standard distance of ten parsecs or 32.6 light years. The\r\nabsolute magnitude of the sun is five. That is, the sun would be a\r\nfifth-magnitude star at the standard distance of 32.6 light-years.\r\nThe absolute magnitudes of stars indicate how bright they would be\r\nrelatively if they were all at the same standard distance. Apparent\r\nmagnitudes indicate how bright the stars appear to be at their true\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of the moon from the earth is approximately 240,000\r\nmiles or sixty times the earth's radius.\r\n\r\nThe sun is four hundred times farther away than the moon and its\r\ndiameter is about four hundred times greater than the moon's diameter.\r\n\r\nThe nearest star is about 275,000 times more distant than the sun,\r\nand the most distant known object, the globular star cluster, N.G.C.\r\n7106, is about fourteen billion times more distant than the sun.\r\n\r\nThe earth is a spheroid flattened at the poles and its polar diameter\r\nis about twenty-seven miles shorter than its equatorial diameter. An\r\nobject weighs less at the poles than at the equator.\r\n\r\nThe earth's interior is as rigid as steel and probably consists of a\r\ncore of magnetic iron surrounded by an outer stony shell.\r\n\r\nEclipses of the sun occur when the moon passes between the earth and\r\nsun. They can only occur at the time of new moon. There must be at\r\nleast two solar eclipses every year separated by an interval of six\r\nmonths and there may be as many as five solar eclipses in a year.\r\nEclipses of the moon occur when the earth comes between the sun and\r\nmoon, and the moon passes into the earth's shadow. Eclipses of the\r\nmoon can only occur at full moon. There may or may not be eclipses of\r\nthe moon every year. The greatest number of eclipses than can occur\r\nin any one year, solar and lunar combined, is seven and the least\r\nnumber is two and in that case they are both solar eclipses.\r\n\r\nThe sun is a yellow, dwarf star of a density of one and one-fourth\r\nthat of water and with a surface temperature of about 12,000° F.\r\nexcept in sun-spot regions where the temperature is about 6,000° F.\r\nIt is probably gaseous throughout.\r\n\r\nThe sun, as well as the planets, rotates on its axis and different\r\nportions of the surface rotate at slightly different rates. The\r\naverage period of the rotation of the sun on its axis is about\r\ntwenty-six days.\r\n\r\nThe sun is a variable star with a twofold variation. One is of long\r\nperiod during the eleven-year sun-spot cycle with a range of from\r\nthree to five per cent. The other is a short irregular variation with\r\na period of a few days, weeks or months and a range of from three to\r\nten per cent.\r\n\r\nSun-spots are solar cyclones and appear black only by contrast with\r\ntheir hotter and brighter surroundings. They come in eleven-year\r\ncycles (approximately) with periods of maximum and minimum appearance.\r\n\r\nThe brightness and blue color of the sky is due to the scattering\r\nof sunlight by the molecules of oxygen and nitrogen in the earth's\r\nupper atmosphere. If there were no atmosphere the skies would appear\r\nblack except in the direction of the heavenly bodies, which would be\r\nvisible by day as well as by night.\r\n\r\nThe solar corona is the rare outer envelope of the sun and it is\r\nvisible only during a total eclipse of the sun. It is partly of an\r\nelectrical nature and it varies in form during the sun-spot cycle. It\r\noften extends to a distance of several solar diameters on either side\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\nThe warmth and the habitability of the earth's surface is due to the\r\npresence of water-vapor and carbon-dioxide in the atmosphere. Without\r\nthese substances in the atmosphere life on the earth's surface would\r\nbe impossible.\r\n\r\nHalf of the earth's atmosphere and all clouds lie within seven miles\r\nof the earth's surface, and at high elevations above the earth the\r\ntemperature is many degrees below zero.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of space approaches the absolute zero of -459° F.\r\n\r\nThe only planets in the solar system with the exception of the earth\r\nthat might possibly support life are Venus and Mars.\r\n\r\nStars shine by their own light but planets shine only by reflected\r\nlight from the sun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the earth were represented by a six-inch school globe the sun\r\nwould be on the same scale a globe fifty-four feet in diameter.\r\nMercury would be a small ball two and a third inches in diameter.\r\nVenus would be another six-inch globe. Mars would be a ball about\r\nthe size of a baseball, three and a fifth inches in diameter. The\r\nmoon would be about the size of a golf ball, one and a half inches\r\nin diameter. The largest asteroids would be the size of marbles.\r\nAverage-sized asteroids would be the size of shot and the smallest\r\nwould be merely grains of sand.\r\n\r\nJupiter would be a huge globe standing as tall as a man five feet\r\nsix inches in height. Saturn would be a smaller globe four and a\r\nhalf feet in diameter and its ring system would extend to a distance\r\nof five and a half feet on either side of the globe. Uranus would\r\nbe represented by a globe almost exactly two feet in diameter and\r\nNeptune would be a slightly larger globe with a diameter of two feet\r\ntwo and a half inches.\r\n\r\nThe satellites of the outer planets would range in size from tennis\r\nand golf balls for the largest, to marbles for the smaller and grains\r\nof sand for the smallest.\r\n\r\nOn the same scale of measurement the distance of the six-inch globe\r\nof the earth from the fifty-four foot globe representing the sun\r\nwould be one and one-tenth miles. The moon would be placed fifteen\r\nfeet from the earth-globe and the diameter of the solar system on the\r\nsame scale measured across the orbit of Neptune would be sixty-six\r\nmiles. The nearest star on this scale would be three hundred thousand\r\nmiles away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the distance from the earth to the sun is taken as one inch so\r\nthat the scale of the universe is reduced six trillion times, the\r\ndiameter of the solar system across Neptune's orbit is five feet and\r\nthe distance of one light-year comes out almost exactly equal to one\r\nmile. The nearest star to the five-foot solar system would be four\r\nand a third miles away; the most distant known object would be two\r\nhundred and twenty thousand miles away, and the extent of the visible\r\nuniverse would be three hundred thousand miles. On the same scale the\r\ndiameter of our sun would be about one hundredth of an inch and the\r\ndiameters of the giant stars Antares and Betelgeuze would be four\r\ninches and two and three-fourth inches respectively. To see the earth\r\nwe would need a microscope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n =============+=============+========+============+========+============+===========\r\n              |Mean Distance from Sun|            |Velocity|            |\r\n              +-------------+--------+            |   in   |            |Inclination\r\n              |             |Relative|   Period   | Orbit  |Eccentricity|    of\r\n  Planet      |  In Miles   |   to   |     of     |(Miles  |    of      | Orbit to\r\n              |             |Earth's | Revolution |  per   |   Orbit    | Ecliptic\r\n              |             |Distance|            |Second )|            |\r\n  ------------+-------------+--------+------------+--------+------------+-----------\r\n  Mercury     |   36,000,000|  0.39  | 87.97 days |23 to 35|    .2056   | 7°     0'\r\n  Venus       |   67,200,000|  0.72  |224.70 days |  21.9  |    .0068   | 3     23\r\n  Earth       |   92,900,000|  1.00  |365.25 days |  18.5  |    .0167   | 0      0\r\n  Mars        |  141,500,000|  1.52  |  1.88 years|  15.0  |    .0933   | 1     51\r\n  Asteroids[1]|  ...........|2.0-5.2 |  ......... | ...... | .00 to .40 | 0° to 35°\r\n  Jupiter     |  483,300,000|  5.20  | 11.86 years|   8.1  |    .0484   | 1     18\r\n  Saturn      |  886,000,000|  9.54  | 29.46 years|   6.0  |    .0558   | 2     29\r\n  Uranus      |1,781,900,000| 19.19  | 84.02 years|   4.2  |    .0471   | 0     46\r\n  Neptune     |2,971,600,000| 30.07  |164.79 years|   3.4  |    .0085   | 1     47\r\n  ============+=============+========+============+========+============+===========\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] About 940 have been discovered up to the present time.\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM (Continued)\r\n\r\n  =========+========+==========+==========+========+============+==========+==========+============+===========\r\n           |  Mean  |          |          |Density |  Surface   |Velocity  |Reflecting|  Period    |Inclination\r\n    Name   |Diameter|   Mass   |  Volume  |Relative|  Gravity   |of Escape |  Power   |    of      |     of\r\n           |   in   +----------+----------+to that | (Relative  |(Miles per|   in     |   Axial    |  Equator\r\n           |  Miles | Relative to Earth's |of Water| to Earth's)| Second)  | Per Cent | Rotation   |  to Orbit\r\n  ---------+--------+----------+----------+--------+------------+----------+----------+------------+-----------\r\n  Sun      | 864,392|  329,390 | 1,300,000|  1.40  |   27.64    |  383     |  .....   |25 d. 8   h.|  7° 15'\r\n  Moon     |   2,160|     .012 |    .02   |  3.34  |    0.16    |    1.5   |     7    |27 d. 7.7 h.|  6  41\r\n  Mercury  |   3,009|     .045 |    .06   |  4.48?

That\r\nstatement was removed, and the actual note from page 126 was moved to\r\nits place with the illustration.\r\n\r\nP. 174: [...]--duplicate of later line \"occurred at L'Aigle, France,\r\nin 1803. Between two\" appeared at this spot. Possible missing text\r\nwhere the line occurred.\r\n\r\np. 233: period of 2^d 20^h 48.9^m--carat (^) indicates that the\r\nletter immediately following appears as a superscript.\r\n\r\nData in tables retained as in original, but may be incorrect--for\r\nexample, the escape velocity of Mars, represented as 1.5 miles per\r\nsecond in Table I, is closer to 3.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Astronomy for Young Folks, by Isabel Martin Lewis",
