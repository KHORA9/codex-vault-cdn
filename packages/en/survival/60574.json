As part of this effort, the Geological and Geographical Survey\r\nof the Territories was organized within the Department of the Interior,\r\nand staffed by a group of hardy, pioneering scientists under the\r\nleadership of geologist F. V. Hayden. During the summer of 1871, these\r\nmen, accompanied by photographer William H. Jackson and artist Thomas\r\nMoran, made a reconnaissance geological study of the legendary and\r\nmysterious “Yellowstone Wonderland” in remote northwestern Wyoming\r\nTerritory. The scientific reports and illustrations prepared by Hayden\r\nand his colleagues, supplementing the startling accounts that had been\r\npublished by members of the famous Washburn-Doane Expedition a year\r\nearlier, erased all doubts that this unique land was eminently worthy of\r\nbeing set aside “for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.” By Act of\r\nCongress on March 1, 1872, our first National Park was established.\r\n\r\nDuring the past century, 50 million people have toured Yellowstone\r\nNational Park, marveling at its never-ending display of natural wonders.\r\nNo doubt many have paused to wonder about the origin of these unusual\r\nand complex geological features—a question, needless to say, that has\r\nintrigued and challenged scientists from the very first days of the\r\nHayden Survey. During the past decade a group of U. S. Geological Survey\r\nscientists, in cooperation with the National Park Service and aided by\r\nthe interest of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in\r\nremote sensing of the geologic phenomena, has been probing the depths\r\nand farthest corners of the Park seeking more of the answers. Some of\r\nthe results of this work, and those of earlier studies, are described in\r\nthis book to provide a better understanding and enjoyment of this great\r\nNational Park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: V.

We now\r\nknow that the earliest visitors, even if prone to exaggerate, could not\r\ndo justice to the long-hidden secrets of Yellowstone, for none of them\r\nsaw all of the fascinating features that occur within this great\r\nNational Park.\r\n\r\nBy the time the modern-day visitor enters Yellowstone National Park\r\nthrough any of its five entrances, he probably will have traveled\r\nthrough many parts of the Rocky Mountains and grown somewhat accustomed\r\nto the “lay of the land.” But this will in no way lessen the exciting\r\nimpact of viewing the natural wonders of Yellowstone for the first time.\r\nImmediate attention, of course, is still drawn to the remarkable array\r\nof geysers, hot springs, and other thermal phenomena which in sheer\r\nnumbers and variety are unsurpassed throughout the world. But, as if\r\nthese were not enough of an attraction, nature has also provided an\r\nincredible setting of sparkling rivers and lakes, thundering waterfalls\r\nand cataracts, awesome canyons and gorges, and lofty glaciated mountain\r\npeaks and extinct volcanoes. Truly this is a land apart, a spectacular\r\nmasterpiece of nature that fully deserves the accolade of “wonderland”\r\nbestowed long ago by early explorers and trappers.

The Park embraces 3,472 square miles (2,221,770 acres),\r\n    and its boundaries traverse a distance of nearly 300 miles.\r\n    Yellowstone Lake, with an irregular shoreline of 110 miles and a\r\n    surface area of 137 square miles, is one of the largest natural\r\n    mountain lakes in the United States. (Fig. 1)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INDEX MAP showing localities where photographs (and\r\n    one sketch, fig. 35) were taken to illustrate this bulletin. For\r\n    photographs of distant views, arrows point in direction of view.\r\n    Numbers refer to figure numbers in text. (Fig. 2)]\r\n\r\nBeyond the first stirring impressions derived from the grandeur of the\r\nvast Yellowstone wilderness and its myriad wildlife, assuredly shared by\r\npeople of all ages and from all walks of life, the various aspects of\r\nthe Park take on a very different meaning for different individuals. The\r\nartist sees grand vistas to be painted, the naturalist delights in the\r\nflower-laden meadows and the native habitats of many kinds of birds and\r\nanimals, the engineer visualizes the amount of energy stored in the\r\nwaterfalls and steaming geysers, and so on. To the geologist, in\r\nparticular, who studies rocks and fossils and all of the natural\r\nprocesses involved in shaping the surface of the land, and to all those\r\nwho would share such interests, Yellowstone takes on a very special\r\nmeaning. For the Park is foremost a geological Park, created by an\r\nextraordinary sequence of natural processes and events that have\r\ncombined to produce an immense outdoor laboratory for studies that have\r\ncontributed to a fuller knowledge and a better understanding of the\r\nearth itself. The geological aspect of the Yellowstone country is\r\nreflected by its very name, given long ago to the river that issues from\r\nthe great canyon of the “yellow rocks.”[1] This report, borrowing from a\r\ncentury of scientific study within and around the Park area, describes\r\nthe geological “how, why, and when” of this unique and fascinating\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A geological preview\r\n\r\nSome 600,000 years ago the rumblings of an impending volcanic eruption\r\nsounded ominously across the Yellowstone country. Suddenly, in a mighty\r\ncrescendo of deafening explosions, tremendous quantities of hot volcanic\r\nash and pumice spewed from giant cracks at the earth’s surface. Towering\r\ndust clouds blackened the sky, and vast sheets of volcanic debris spread\r\nout rapidly across the countryside in all directions, covering thousands\r\nof square miles in a matter of minutes with a blanket of utter\r\ndevastation. Abruptly, a great smoldering pit—a caldera 30 miles across,\r\n45 miles long, and several thousand feet deep—appeared in the central\r\nYellowstone region, the ground having fallen into the huge underground\r\ncavern that was left by the earth-shaking eruptions. Lava then began\r\noozing from the cracks to fill the still-smoking caldera.\r\n\r\nThus, in one brief “moment” of geologic time there was launched that\r\nincredible chain of events which led to the creation of many of the\r\nnatural wonders of Yellowstone National Park. Heat from the enormous\r\nreservoir of molten rock which produced the massive eruption still\r\nremains deep within the earth beneath Yellowstone, sustaining the\r\nspectacular hot-water and steam phenomena for which the Park is so\r\njustly famous. The formation of the caldera and the eruption of lavas\r\nprofoundly influenced the shape of the present-day landscape. Once a\r\nland covered almost entirely by mountains, the part that\r\ncollapsed—nearly one-third of the total Park area—is now characterized\r\nby low rolling plateaus formed from the thick lava flows that filled the\r\ncaldera (figs. 1 and 2; see fig. 22 for the outline of the Yellowstone\r\ncaldera). Moreover, the carving of the spectacular Grand Canyon of the\r\nYellowstone (fig. 41) and the fashioning of the large interior basin now\r\noccupied by beautiful Yellowstone Lake (fig. 27) were closely related to\r\nthis mighty volcanic event.\r\n\r\nNorth, east, and south of the central plateaus are extensive mountain\r\nranges and other highlands which provide much of the Park’s scenic\r\nbeauty (figs. 3 and 4). Formed by many episodes of intense mountain\r\nbuilding and ancient volcanism, these uplands bear the lasting imprints\r\nof a wide variety of geological activities that date back approximately\r\n2.7 billion years. Indeed, as we study all the features of the\r\nYellowstone landscape, we find in them a most impressive and fascinating\r\nstory of that ageless conflict between the internal forces of nature\r\nthat raise the land through the upheaval of mountains and the eruption\r\nof volcanoes, and the external forces of erosion that wear the land\r\ndown. It is this vast relentless interplay of giant forces that\r\ndetermines the appearance of any given place upon the earth’s surface.\r\nAnd, in few other places around the globe can the processes of both\r\nbuilding up and tearing down the landscape be illustrated more\r\ndramatically than in Yellowstone National Park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SKYLINE OF THE GALLATIN RANGE in northwestern\r\n    Yellowstone National Park, as viewed from a point on the road\r\n    between Canyon Village and Norris Junction. The range consists\r\n    chiefly of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks and Precambrian\r\n    metamorphic rocks that were uplifted by folding and faulting of the\r\n    earth’s crust. The dark-gray rocks along the roadcut in the left\r\n    foreground are rhyolite lava flows of the Solfatara Plateau. (Fig.\r\n    3)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HAYDEN VALLEY.

Mount Washburn, part of\r\n    an ancient Absaroka volcano, is the highest prominence (elevation,\r\n    10,293 feet) on the skyline to the right, and Dunraven Pass is in\r\n    the notch in the center of the skyline. The foot of the range marks\r\n    the north edge of the Yellowstone caldera. Hayden Valley is cut in\r\n    glacial lake sediments that overlie thick lava flows covering the\r\n    caldera floor.

This kind of\r\nreasoning is used to interpret the origins of all types of ancient\r\nrocks, for all the known geological processes that form rocks seem to\r\nhave been operating since the earth’s beginning.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 shows the many different rock units that have been recognized\r\nin Yellowstone National Park. Arranged in a vertical column according to\r\nthe geologic time intervals in which they formed, these rocks represent\r\na large part of total earth history (fig. 6). A generalized geologic map\r\n(plate 1) shows the distribution of the various units (or groups of\r\nclosely related units) exposed at the surface throughout the Park area.\r\nThis map and figure 5 summarize much of the information that is\r\nnecessary to interpret the Park’s geologic history—in essence, to\r\nprovide answers to these two important questions: What were the geologic\r\nevents that formed the rocks? When did these events occur?\r\n\r\n\r\n                            The oldest rocks\r\n\r\nIf we were to walk backward in time at the rate of one century per step,\r\nthe first step would return us to 1872, the year that Yellowstone\r\nNational Park was established. But to return to the oldest recorded\r\nevent in its geologic history, we would have to walk (at 3 feet per\r\nstep) some 15,000 miles, or three-fifths of the way around the world!\r\nOccurring far back in the antiquity of the Precambrian Era—approximately\r\n2.7 billion years ago according to radiometric dating (fig. 6)—the\r\noldest event resulted in rocks so crumpled and changed by heat and\r\npressure that their original character is obscure. These rocks, having\r\nbeen transformed from still older ones, are called _metamorphic rocks_.\r\nConsidered to form part of the very foundation of the continent itself,\r\nthey are also commonly referred to as _basement rocks_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE ROCKS of Yellowstone National Park, separated\r\n    into individual units or formations and arranged according to their\r\n    geologic ages (see fig. 6).

The\r\n    identifying features of each formation provide valuable clues\r\n    bearing on its origin. Most formations are given formal names, and\r\n    usually each formation is thick and widespread enough to be\r\n    recognized over broad areas.

Column A, graduated in\r\n    billions of years (B.Y.) and subdivided into the four major geologic\r\n    eras (Precambrian, for example), represents the time elapsed since\r\n    the beginning of the earth, which is believed to have been about 4.5\r\n    billion years ago. Column B is an expansion of part of the time\r\n    scale in millions of years (M.Y.), to show the subdivisions\r\n    (periods—Cambrian, for example) of the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and\r\n    Cenozoic Eras; column C is a further expansion to show particularly\r\n    the subdivisions (epochs—Paleocene, for example) of the Tertiary and\r\n    Quaternary Periods. The principal events in the geologic history of\r\n    Yellowstone National Park are listed to the right of column C,\r\n    opposite the time intervals in which they occurred. The ages, in\r\n    years, are based on radiometric dating. Many rocks contain\r\n    radioactive elements which begin to decay at a very slow but\r\n    measurable rate as soon as the parent rock is formed. The most\r\n    common radioactive elements are uranium, rubidium, and potassium,\r\n    and their decay (“daughter”) products are lead, strontium, and\r\n    argon, respectively. By measuring both the amount of a given\r\n    daughter product and the amount of the original radioactive element\r\n    still remaining in the parent rock, and then relating these\r\n    measurements to their known rate of radioactive decay, the age of\r\n    the rock in actual numbers of years can be calculated. The decay of\r\n    radioactive carbon (carbon-14) to nitrogen is especially useful for\r\n    dating rocks less than 40,000 years old. (Fig. 6)]\r\n\r\nGneiss, a coarsely banded rock (fig. 7), and schist, a finely banded\r\nrock, are the most common kinds of metamorphic rocks in Yellowstone.\r\nOriginally, the gneiss probably was granite, and the schist was a shale\r\nor sandstone. Outcrops of the gneisses and schists occur only in the\r\nnorthern part of the Park (pl. 1), where they form the central cores of\r\nsome mountain ranges such as the Gallatin Range (fig. 3). They also lie\r\nburied beneath younger rocks in many other areas of the Park.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the metamorphic event, when the gneisses and schists\r\nwere formed, until the deposition of sediments of the Cambrian Period\r\n(figs. 5 and 6), there is virtually no record. It is reasonably certain,\r\nhowever, that several times during this 2.1-billion-year interval the\r\nregion was intensely squeezed and uplifted into high mountains and then\r\ndeeply eroded. By the end of Precambrian time, approximately 570 million\r\nyears ago, the ancient Yellowstone landscape had been reduced by erosion\r\nto a flat, stark, almost featureless plain, which was soon to be flooded\r\nby a shallow sea encroaching from the west. This very old surface is now\r\npartly exposed in some places across the Buffalo Plateau, at the north\r\nedge of the Park (fig. 1).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LAMAR RIVER. View downstream (west) along the Lamar\r\n    River in Lamar Canyon. The rocks along the river banks are coarsely\r\n    banded Precambrian gneisses more than 2.5 billion years old, some of\r\n    the oldest rocks in Yellowstone National Park. (Fig. 7)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Closeup views show coarse banding and texture of the\r\n    gneiss; minerals include quartz, feldspar, and biotite (black\r\n    mica).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The deposits of the shifting seas\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the rugged, mountainous terrain of Yellowstone\r\nNational Park, it is difficult to visualize a time when this region lay\r\nclose to sea level, at times even below sea level. Yet the evidence is\r\nclear that from the Cambrian Period to the latter part of the Cretaceous\r\nPeriod, a span of about 500 million years, vast stretches of western\r\nlands were flooded repeatedly by broad shallow seas that often reached\r\nfrom Canada to Mexico (fig. 8). During these great floodings, widespread\r\nhorizontal beds of sand, silt, clay, limy mud, and other sediments were\r\ndeposited on the ocean floors, along the adjoining beaches and wide\r\ntidal flats, and across the broad flood plains of large rivers that\r\nemptied into the seas. All of these ancient sediments have now hardened\r\ninto compact well-layered sandstones, shales, and limestones (figs. 9\r\nand 10). These _sedimentary rocks_ have been divided into 25 or more\r\ndistinct formations in the Yellowstone region (fig. 5), where they\r\nlocally attain a combined thickness of more than 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe first Paleozoic sea to reach the Yellowstone region, some 550\r\nmillion years ago, brought with it the earliest abundant signs of life\r\non earth. Small hard-shelled animals that lived mainly on the shallow\r\nsea bottom are now preserved as fossils in rocks deposited during the\r\nCambrian Period. Many of these animals were _trilobites_, long-extinct\r\norganisms resembling today’s crabs and spiders. Each younger set of\r\nrocks or formations contains a different group of dominant fossils, each\r\ndiagnostic of that period of geologic time in which they lived (fig.\r\n11).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MIDDLE PERMIAN SEAS. Distribution of sea (blue) and\r\n    land (red) during the middle part of Permian time (approximately 250\r\n    million years ago). Only a part of the Yellowstone National Park\r\n    area (black) was flooded during this period. (Fig. 8)]\r\n\r\nFossils indicate the kind of environment in which the animals lived\r\n(fig. 12). Some species thrived in the open oceans; others thrived only\r\nalong the beaches and in nearby lagoons. Still others, such as the\r\nincredibly large dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods, could\r\nsurvive only on the land or in swamps. From studies of the fossils and\r\nof the physical characteristics of the rocks in which they are now\r\nfound, the shoreline patterns of the shifting seas can be determined.\r\nStudies show that the seas advanced and retreated across the Yellowstone\r\nPark region at least a dozen times during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic\r\nEras.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the Mesozoic Era (in the latter part of the Cretaceous\r\nPeriod), the metamorphic basement rocks of Yellowstone lay covered by\r\nthe vast blanket of flat-lying sediments. Today, these sedimentary rocks\r\nare exposed along the Snake River and its tributaries in the\r\nsouth-central part of the Park, over much of the Gallatin Range in the\r\nnorthwest corner, and at several places in the north-central and\r\nnortheastern parts (pl. 1). Elsewhere, either they are hidden from view\r\nbeneath volcanic debris—ash and lava—that later buried them, or they\r\nhave been removed by erosion. But wherever exposed, the original\r\nhorizontal layers of sedimentary rocks have been severely twisted and\r\nbroken by later mountain-building movements.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CROWFOOT RIDGE in the southern Gallatin Range, as\r\n    viewed from the road along the Gallatin River near the northwest\r\n    corner of Yellowstone National Park. The rocks, chiefly Paleozoic\r\n    limestone, sandstone, and shale, were deposited in broad shallow\r\n    seas that covered all of the Yellowstone region several hundred\r\n    million years ago. The original layers were horizontal, but they\r\n    have since been tilted and broken by giant mountain-building forces\r\n    originating deep within the earth.

The conspicuous rimrock at the\r\n    top of the mountain to the right is composed of the Yellowstone\r\n    Tuff.

The origin and nature of the\r\nforces that bent and cracked the crust are unknown, but current theories\r\nbeing developed about sea-floor spreading and continental drift may shed\r\nlight on this major upheaval that began about 75 million years ago. A\r\nsignificant effect of the Laramide orogeny was the uplift and contortion\r\nof many of the mountain ranges within what we today call the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nAt the onset of the crustal disturbance, the gently rolling landscape of\r\nthe Yellowstone region began to warp and flex into large upfolds\r\n(_anticlines_) and downfolds (_synclines_) (fig. 13). Gradually the\r\nmountain-building pressures increased, finally reaching such magnitude\r\nthat the limbs of the folds could bend and stretch no further;\r\nthereupon, the rock layers broke and were shoved over one another along\r\nextensive _reverse faults_. The severely crumpled rocks within the Park\r\narea can now be seen only along the north edge and in the south-central\r\npart along the Snake River. In both places, the folds and faults are\r\nespecially well displayed by the layered Paleozoic and Mesozoic\r\nsedimentary formations (fig. 9).\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent Laramide structural features is a large\r\nanticline in the north-central and northeastern parts of the Park (fig.\r\n14, section B-B′); the road from Mammoth to the Northeast Entrance\r\ncrosses much of this feature (pl. 1). Although originally forming a high\r\nmountain mass, the anticline has been eroded so extensively that it no\r\nlonger appears mountainous (fig. 18). It displays a broad core of\r\nPrecambrian gneisses and schists and is bounded along its southwest\r\nmargin by a large reverse fault. Along the fault, the ancient gneisses\r\nand schists have been shoved over rocks as young as Late Cretaceous, a\r\nmovement amounting to 10,000 feet or more. The Cretaceous rocks are\r\nthose that are now exposed at Mount Everts (fig. 10).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON KINDS OF GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES produced by\r\n    deformation of the earth’s crust. An original horizontal rock layer\r\n    may be upfolded into anticlines, downfolded into synclines, and\r\n    broken by either reverse or normal faults. A fault is a fracture or\r\n    a zone of fractures within the earth’s crust along which movement\r\n    has taken place. A reverse fault is one generally produced by\r\n    compression (squeezing together), and the hanging-wall block has\r\n    moved up with respect to the footwall block. A normal fault is one\r\n    generally produced by tension (pulling apart), and the hanging-wall\r\n    block has moved down with respect to the footwall block. All these\r\n    kinds of structures are present in Yellowstone National Park.

In south-central Yellowstone, the\r\nPaleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks were tightly folded into three\r\nanticlines separated from one another by synclines and faults (fig. 14,\r\nsection C-C′). Movement along one reverse fault in this area was locally\r\nmore than 10,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAs the lands were uplifted and contorted, they came under vigorous\r\nattack by the ever-present agents of erosion. Tremendous quantities of\r\nrock were stripped from the highlands, and the debris was carried by\r\nstreams into the adjacent lowland basins and deposited mostly as sand\r\nand gravel. As the highlands continued to rise, the basins continued to\r\nsink, and in a short period of time great thicknesses of basin-fill\r\nsediments accumulated locally. One such deposit, the Harebell Formation\r\nof latest Cretaceous age in south-central Yellowstone (fig. 5), is more\r\nthan 8,000 feet thick.\r\n\r\nOther similar anticlines, synclines, and reverse faults no doubt extend\r\nfar into the interior of Yellowstone National Park, and perhaps entirely\r\nacross it in places, but they lie buried beneath a thick capping of\r\nvolcanic rocks. Nevertheless, it seems safe to conclude that none of the\r\nPark area escaped the effects of the great forces of the Laramide\r\norogeny. These forces, regardless of how they originated deep within the\r\nearth, seem to have been compressional (fig. 13), pushing the upper\r\nlayers of the earth’s crust from the east and northeast toward the west\r\nand southwest. This interpretation is based on the style of the\r\nstructural features just described, which shows that the steep limbs of\r\nfolds, as well as the direction of movements along reverse faults, point\r\ntoward the west or southwest (fig. 14).\r\n\r\nBy early Eocene time, about 20 million years after they had begun, the\r\ndeformational forces relaxed. But the effects of the giant earth\r\nmovements were to last for a very long time. Crustal disturbances of\r\nsuch magnitude commonly produce conditions deep within the earth which,\r\nin places, gives rise to intense volcanic activity; one such place was\r\nYellowstone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CROSS SECTIONS SHOWING GEOLOGIC STRUCTURES in\r\n    Yellowstone National Park. These illustrate the possible rock\r\n    relationships that might be seen along the faces of vertical slices\r\n    of the earth’s crust, if it could be cut and pulled apart (much like\r\n    slicing a cake and looking at the different layers).

(Fig. 14)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Volcanic activity\r\n\r\nIn early Eocene time, between 55 and 50 million years ago, several large\r\nvolcanoes erupted in and near Yellowstone National Park. This volcanic\r\nactivity resulted in the accumulation of the vast pile of Absaroka\r\nvolcanic rocks (fig. 5) which now makes up most of the Absaroka and\r\nWashburn Ranges and part of the Gallatin Range, and which covers several\r\nother smaller areas in the Park (pl. 1).\r\n\r\nWhat special geologic conditions would cause these spectacular eruptions\r\nof molten rock at the earth’s surface? Measurements taken in deep mines\r\nand oil wells show that the normal increase in the earth’s temperature\r\nwith depth is about 1°F per 100 feet. This heat is generated by the\r\ndecay of radioactive elements—chiefly uranium, thorium, and\r\npotassium—which are present in at least small amounts in virtually all\r\nrocks of the earth’s crust. Ordinarily, enough heat is conducted to the\r\nearth’s surface so that the deeply buried rocks do not become hot enough\r\nto melt. In some places, however, the heat is not carried off fast\r\nenough, and the temperature rises slowly toward the melting point of the\r\nrock. Such hot spots may develop (1) because the rocks in those places\r\ncontain more than an average amount of radioactive elements; (2) because\r\nhotter material moves upward from still deeper levels in the earth; or\r\n(3) because drastic changes in pressure are brought about by the\r\nalternate squeezing and relaxing of mountain-building forces, which in\r\nturn substantially affect the melting point of the rocks. Whatever the\r\ncause, the eventual result is the accumulation of a huge body of molten\r\nrock, called _magma_, enclosed in a deep underground chamber.\r\n\r\nMagma, being a mixture of hot liquids and gases that is lighter in\r\nweight than the solid rocks surrounding it, tends to rise toward the\r\nearth’s surface. Forcing its way upward, some of the molten material\r\nsolidifies before reaching the surface and forms bodies of various kinds\r\nof _intrusive igneous rocks_ (fig. 15). Some of the magma, however,\r\nreaches the surface and either pours out as lava or is blown out\r\nexplosively as rock fragments, ash, and pumice to form _extrusive\r\nigneous rocks_.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INTRUSIVE AND EXTRUSIVE IGNEOUS ROCK BODIES.\r\n    Extrusive rocks solidified above ground, and intrusive rocks\r\n    solidified below ground. All features shown occur in Yellowstone\r\n    National Park.

Most of the eruptions were fairly quiet,\r\nwith the molten rock welling up to the surface and cascading down the\r\nsides of the volcanoes chiefly as viscous lava flows and breccias. Rain,\r\nseeping into these porous rocks, caused huge landslides of mud and\r\nbroken rock to stream down the mountainsides. Hence, many of the rocks\r\nseen today are volcanic breccias—jumbled but crudely layered deposits of\r\nlarge and small angular blocks embedded in a sandy matrix, much like\r\nman-made concrete except that the rock fragments are considerably\r\ncoarser (fig. 17). Viewed from a distance, however, most of the breccia\r\ndeposits have a distinct layered appearance (fig. 18). The predominant\r\nextrusive igneous rock in the Absaroka volcanic sequence is andesite,\r\nbut basalt also occurs in places (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ABSAROKA VOLCANOES and their rocks. Lava (mostly\r\n    andesite) poured from central vents and formed volcanoes, some steep\r\n    sided and others broad and relatively flat. As the lava spilled out,\r\n    much of it quickly solidified, broke up into large angular blocks\r\n    (breccia), and then either tumbled down the slopes of the volcanoes\r\n    as individual boulders or slid down in mudflows and landslides. Some\r\n    of the material was also explosively blown out as rock bombs,\r\n    cinders, and ash. The more fluid lava (mostly basalt), on the other\r\n    hand, flowed quietly down the volcanic slopes and onto the\r\n    surrounding lowlands. The rocks near the volcanic centers therefore\r\n    include thick crudely layered coarse breccias, thin fine ash and\r\n    dust falls, and thin to thick lava flows. The volcanoes were\r\n    repeatedly attacked by erosion, and the eroded material was\r\n    redeposited by streams and mudflows in widespread layers of volcanic\r\n    conglomerate and sandstone across the flat-floored valleys and\r\n    plains between the volcanoes. Forests, which grew luxuriantly in\r\n    these lowland areas, were repeatedly buried by volcanic eruptions\r\n    and are now preserved (see inset) as the fossil forests of\r\n    Yellowstone. (Based on information supplied by H. W. Smedes and H.\r\n    J. Prostka.)

The finer\r\ndebris that reached the lower slopes of the volcanoes was reworked and\r\ncarried by streams into the intervening valleys, where it was deposited\r\nas sand and gravel (fig. 16). Eventually the entire Yellowstone region\r\nwas choked with volcanic debris, the material from one volcano mixing\r\nwith that from neighboring volcanoes. Even the mountain masses uplifted\r\nduring the preceding Laramide orogeny were covered by the vast\r\naccumulation (fig. 18).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MASSIVE BEDS OF BRECCIA of the Absaroka volcanic\r\n    rocks along the road north of Dunraven Pass. This breccia formed\r\n    part of a steep-sided volcanic cone, of which Mount Washburn is a\r\n    remnant. (Fig. 17)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Closeup view shows very coarse character of the\r\n    breccia, with large rock fragments imbedded in fine ash, dust, and\r\n    sand. Nearly all the rocks are of andesitic composition, consisting\r\n    chiefly of feldspar and pyroxene. Most common colors are medium to\r\n    fairly dark shades of brown, red, purple, and gray.]\r\n\r\nAbsaroka volcanism, however, was not a simple, continuous process—the\r\neruptions were intermittent, the many volcanoes were not always active\r\nat the same time, and between eruptions there were long periods of\r\nquiescence during which the erupted material was deeply eroded. The\r\nrepetitive nature of the eruptions is best illustrated by the famous\r\nfossil forests of Yellowstone. Here is striking evidence that enough\r\ntime elapsed between eruptions for widespread forests to become\r\nestablished on the lower slopes of the volcanoes and in the broad\r\nvalleys between them. Judged from the great size of some of the\r\nnow-petrified logs (fig. 19), several hundreds of years must have passed\r\nbefore another volcanic outburst smothered the forest. Many different\r\nforest layers have been recognized in the Specimen Ridge area as well as\r\nin several other places throughout the Park.\r\n\r\nAs the Absaroka magma rose from deep underground, some of it squirted,\r\nlike toothpaste, into the layered Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary\r\nrocks through which it passed. These relatively small masses of molten\r\nrock material slowly cooled and crystallized to form intrusive igneous\r\nrocks such as diorite (fig. 20). The resulting intrusive bodies, called\r\n_sills_, _dikes_, _stocks_, and _laccoliths_, depending on their form,\r\nare most abundant in the Gallatin Range and in the vicinity of the East\r\nEntrance (pl. 1). At the conclusion of volcanic activity, the last of\r\nthe rising magma solidified in the main conduits to form slender,\r\nsomewhat cylindrical bodies of rock called _volcanic necks_ that\r\nprobably conform closely to the shape of the original conduits. The\r\ncircular intrusive rock body at Bunsen Peak (fig. 21), now exposed to\r\nview because erosion has stripped away the lava and volcanic breccia\r\nthat once completely buried it, represents either a volcanic neck or a\r\nsmall stock that solidified directly beneath a volcano.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MASSIVELY LAYERED BRECCIAS, conglomerates, and\r\n    sandstones of the Absaroka volcanic sequence at Barronette Peak, as\r\n    viewed from the road near the Northeast Entrance; the ridge is 3,000\r\n    feet high. These rocks, deposited as part of an alluvial plain\r\n    between volcanoes, once filled the Yellowstone region to a level\r\n    higher than the top of Barronette Peak, but erosion since late\r\n    Tertiary time has stripped the volcanics from much of the Park area.\r\n    The volcanic rocks (Eocene in age, fig. 5) rest directly on\r\n    Paleozoic sedimentary rocks along the line indicated. During the\r\n    Laramide orogeny, in Late Cretaceous and early Tertiary times, the\r\n    region was folded and uplifted into mountains. Thousands of feet of\r\n    Mesozoic and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks were then eroded off the\r\n    rising mountains before the Absaroka volcanic rocks were deposited,\r\n    (Fig. 18)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GIANT PETRIFIED TREE TRUNKS in Yellowstone’s fossil\r\n    forest. The enclosing rocks, part of the Absaroka volcanic sequence\r\n    that forms Specimen Ridge, are approximately 50 million years old.\r\n    Many of the tree trunks are still upright, having been smothered and\r\n    buried in their original positions by breccia, ash, and dust from\r\n    nearby volcanoes. It is evident that more than one “forest” is\r\n    represented in this view. Prof. Erling Dorf, of Princeton\r\n    University, counted a total of 27 different forest layers in the\r\n    rocks now exposed at Specimen Ridge. He also determined that the\r\n    most common kinds of trees were sycamore, walnut, magnolia,\r\n    chestnut, oak, redwood, maple, and dogwood. The nearest living\r\n    relatives of many of these trees are now found in the warm temperate\r\n    to subtropical forests of the southeastern and southern United\r\n    States. (National Park Service photograph.) (Fig. 19)]\r\n\r\nMount Washburn is the north half of one of the ancient Absaroka\r\nvolcanoes (fig. 26), and many of the rocks and other features related to\r\nthis volcano, which characterized this great period of volcanism, can be\r\nseen along the road between Canyon Village and Tower. In roadcuts just\r\nsouth of Dunraven Pass several thin igneous dikes cut through volcanic\r\nbreccias. These dikes radiate outward from the nearby central core of\r\nthe volcano, which lies east of the highway in the vicinity of Washburn\r\nHot Springs. From Dunraven Pass northward for 2-3 miles, the road is\r\nlined with lava flows and very coarse breccias that accumulated close to\r\nthe volcanic neck (fig. 17). Farther north toward Tower Falls, breccias\r\nand conglomerates predominate, but the average size of individual rock\r\nfragments decreases gradually northward away from the center of\r\neruption. Beds of sandstone then begin to appear in the sequence, having\r\nbeen deposited mainly by streams that drained the north slope of the\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: IGNEOUS ROCK. Closeup view of intrusive igneous rock\r\n    (diorite) from the Electric Peak stock in the Gallatin Range;\r\n    Electric Peak is pictured in figure 37. The rock is composed chiefly\r\n    of light-colored quartz and feldspar and dark-colored iron and\r\n    magnesium silicate minerals. (Fig. 20)]\r\n\r\nAt the end of Absaroka volcanism, approximately 40 million years ago\r\n(fig. 6), all of Yellowstone lay buried beneath several thousand feet of\r\nlavas, breccias, and ash (fig. 18). The landscape must have appeared as\r\na gently rolling plateau, drained by sluggish, meandering streams and\r\ndotted here and there by volcanoes still rising above the general level\r\nof the ground. This plateau surface, however, probably stood at a\r\nmaximum of only a few thousand feet above sea level, for animals and\r\nplants now found as fossils in the Absaroka volcanic rocks indicate that\r\nwarm-temperature to even subtropical climates existed during the\r\nvolcanic period (fig. 19).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BUNSEN PEAK, a roughly circular body of intrusive\r\n    igneous rock, is the eroded remnant of either the “neck” of an\r\n    Absaroka volcano or a small stock that solidified directly beneath a\r\n    volcano. The peak rises approximately 1,200 feet above a flat plain\r\n    (foreground) that is covered by flows of younger basalt. The\r\n    Yellowstone Tuff, formed by volcanic ash and dust exploded from the\r\n    central Yellowstone region to the south, underlies the basalt. When\r\n    erupted, the volcanic debris (as well as the basalt lava) flowed\r\n    around this high-standing peak. (Fig. 21)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             A quiet period\r\n\r\nLittle is known in detail of the geologic events in Yellowstone during\r\nOligocene and Miocene times. Rocks of these ages have not been\r\nrecognized within the Park; if ever deposited there, they have since\r\nbeen removed by erosion or buried by younger volcanic rocks. Thus, we\r\ncan only speculate as to what events took place during this\r\n25-million-year period. No doubt the broad Absaroka volcanic plateau was\r\neroded, but not deeply, because the topographic relief and stream\r\ngradients of the region remained low. There are also hints that some\r\nvolcanic activity took place, for volcanic rocks representing parts of\r\nthis time interval occur south of the Park, and some of these rocks may\r\nhave originated within the Park area. Little transpired, however, to\r\nsignificantly alter the existing geological makeup of the Park; it was\r\nindeed a quiet time, particularly when compared with the extremely\r\ndynamic periods which immediately preceded and followed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                More mountain building and deep erosion\r\n\r\nMany features of the present-day landscape of Yellowstone stem from\r\nPliocene time, about 10 million years ago. At that time the entire\r\nregion—in fact, much of the Rocky Mountain chain—was being uplifted by\r\ngiant earth movements to heights several thousand feet above its\r\nprevious level. This episode of regional uplift accounts in large\r\nmeasure for the present high average elevation of the Yellowstone\r\ncountry. Although the precise cause of the uplift is unknown, the uplift\r\nassuredly reflects profound changes that were taking place deep within\r\nor beneath the earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nGreat tensional forces, operating during Pliocene time, pulled the\r\nYellowstone region apart and partially broke it into large steep-sided\r\nblocks bounded by _normal faults_ (fig. 13). Some blocks sank while\r\nothers rose, commonly on the order of several thousand feet. The\r\nGallatin Range, in the northwest corner of the Park, for example, was\r\nlifted as a rectangular mountain block along north-trending 20-mile-long\r\nnormal faults that border it on each side (fig. 14, section A-A′; pl.\r\n1). In the south-central part of the Park, the differential movements\r\nbetween several adjacent fault blocks totaled more than 15,000 feet\r\n(fig. 14, section C-C′). Farther south, the Teton Range moved up and the\r\nfloor of Jackson Hole moved down along a normal-fault zone that\r\nstretches along the east foot of the range. An enormous offset of about\r\n30,000 feet developed between the two crustal blocks, accounting in\r\nlarge part for the now incredibly steep and rugged east face of the\r\nTeton Range.\r\n\r\nThe pronounced rise in elevation of the general ground surface and the\r\nchopping of the region into many mountainous fault blocks caused a\r\nprofound increase in the rate of erosion. Once-sluggish streams turned\r\ninto vigorous, fast-moving rivers that began to cut deeply into the\r\nAbsaroka volcanic plateau. Huge quantities of rock debris were stripped\r\noff and carried out of the area, and at the end of the Pliocene, the\r\nYellowstone region must have been very highly dissected mountains and\r\ntable- and canyon-lands. Much of the landscape may have resembled the\r\nrugged terrain now seen in the Absaroka Range along the east side of the\r\nPark. These mountains (fig. 27), and the Washburn Range in the interior\r\nof the Park (fig. 4), today represent but small remnants of the vast\r\npile of Absaroka volcanic rocks that once covered all of Yellowstone and\r\nthe surrounding regions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Moose]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Formation of the Yellowstone Caldera\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now approached that point in geologic time—the beginning of the\r\nQuaternary Period between 2 million and 3 million years ago—when the\r\nstage was set for the triggering of those all-important events that\r\nculminated in the development of the 1,000-square-mile Yellowstone\r\ncaldera and ultimately gave rise to the world-renowned hot-water and\r\nsteam phenomena. Involved were some of the earth’s biggest explosions,\r\nwhich have had no apparent counterpart in recorded human history. A few\r\nextremely explosive eruptions have occurred historically, however, such\r\nas the one that took place on the uninhabited island of Krakatoa,\r\nbetween Java and Sumatra in the East Indies, during the latter part of\r\nAugust 1883. For several days this island had been shaken by a series of\r\nviolent explosions. Then, on August 27, it was ripped by an explosion\r\nthat was heard as far away as Australia, a distance of about 3,000\r\nmiles. Fifty-mile-high dust clouds became windborne around the globe,\r\nproducing colorful sunrises and sunsets in all parts of the world for\r\nseveral years. When the air around Krakatoa finally cleared, it was\r\nfound that two-thirds of the island, some 12 square miles, had collapsed\r\nand vanished into the sea. Though the Krakatoa eruption resulted in a\r\ncaldera that is only a small fraction of the size of the one in\r\nYellowstone, it provides a mental picture to help us understand what has\r\nbeen discovered about the great volcanic holocaust in Yellowstone\r\nNational Park that was described briefly in an early part of this\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OUTLINE OF THE YELLOWSTONE CALDERA produced by the\r\n    enormous volcanic eruption 600,000 years ago. The two oval-shaped\r\n    areas are resurgent domes that arched the caldera floor over twin\r\n    magma chambers after the eruption. The margins of the resurgent\r\n    domes are surrounded by ring fracture zones which extend outward\r\n    toward the edge of the caldera. Numerous fractures in these zones\r\n    provided escape routes through which lavas of the Plateau Rhyolite\r\n    oozed to the surface and poured out across the caldera floor. Today\r\n    these zones also provide underground channels for the circulation of\r\n    hot water in the Yellowstone thermal system.

Thus, the outline of the volcanic\r\ncaldera we now see in the Yellowstone landscape is chiefly the one that\r\nformed 600,000 years ago (fig. 22). The sequence of events described in\r\nthe following pages, and illustrated diagrammatically in figure 23, is\r\nbased on studies of this later eruption; the pattern for the\r\n2,000,000-year-old eruption probably was similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The eruption\r\n\r\nThe giant reservoir of molten rock that built up beneath the Park area\r\nfed two large magma chambers that rose to within a few thousand feet of\r\nthe surface. As the pressures increased, the overlying ground arched,\r\nstretched, and cracked (fig. 23A). Small amounts of lava began to flow\r\nout through the cracks in places, but finally, in a great surge of\r\nrapid, violently explosive eruptions, first from one chamber and then\r\nthe other, mountains of hot pumice, ash, and rock debris spewed from the\r\nearth (fig. 23B). The dense, swirling masses of erupted material spread\r\nout across the countryside in extremely fast moving _ash flows_, swept\r\nalong by hot expanding gases trapped within them. Large quantities of\r\nash and dust were also blown high into the air and dispersed by the\r\nwind. Thin layers of airborne volcanic ash from Yellowstone are now\r\nfound throughout much of the central and western United States.\r\n\r\nThe ash flows (fig. 23B), as they sped across the Yellowstone\r\ncountryside, first filled the old canyons and valleys that had been\r\neroded into the Absaroka volcanic pile and older rocks during Pliocene\r\ntime. Eventually much of this older landscape was buried by ash. Some of\r\nthe larger highlands, such as Mount Washburn and adjacent ridges and\r\nBunsen Peak, however, stood well above the level of the sweeping ash\r\nflows; so the debris flowed around them rather than across them (fig.\r\n21). Finally coming to rest, the hot pumice, ash, and rock particles\r\nsettled down in vast horizontal sheets (fig. 24). Upon cooling and\r\ncrystallizing, the particles welded together to form a series of compact\r\nrocks with the composition of rhyolite (figs. 15 and 25). The term\r\n“ash-flow tuff” (also, the term “welded tuff”) is commonly used to\r\ndescribe these rocks, which now make up the Yellowstone Tuff (fig. 5).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The collapse\r\n\r\nWith the sudden removal of hundreds of cubic miles of molten rock from\r\nunderground, the roofs of the twin magma chambers collapsed. Enormous\r\nblocks of rock fell in above each of the chambers, and a great crater,\r\nor _caldera_, broke the ground surface in central Yellowstone (fig.\r\n23C). The exact depth to which the original surface collapsed is\r\nunknown, but it must have been several thousand feet. The subsidence\r\ntook place chiefly along large vertical, or normal, faults in the ring\r\nfracture zones above the margins of the magma chambers (fig. 22).\r\nAbundant, though less extensive, normal faults also formed outside the\r\ncaldera proper, as the surrounding areas adjusted to the staggering\r\nimpact of the explosive eruptions and subsequent collapse.\r\n\r\nBecause the Yellowstone caldera now lies partly buried by thick lava\r\nflows, the appearance of the caldera today is not nearly as impressive\r\nas it must have been when the caldera was first formed. Many of the\r\nimportant features, however, are particularly well exposed in the\r\nvicinity of Canyon Village (fig. 26). The steep south slope of the\r\nnearby Washburn Range (fig. 4) marks the north edge of the caldera, and\r\nthe range itself stands high because it was not involved in the\r\ncollapse. Canyon Village, on the other hand, lies at a much lower\r\nelevation within the caldera proper. Turnouts on the road just south of\r\nDunraven Pass provide especially fine views of the northern part of the\r\ncaldera, and on a clear day Flat Mountain and the Red Mountains, which\r\nmark the south edge of the caldera, south of Yellowstone Lake, can be\r\nseen 50 miles away. As might be expected, the large basin occupied by\r\nYellowstone Lake owes its existence in part to caldera collapse. The\r\nsouth edge of the caldera cuts across the south-central part of the\r\nlake, along Flat Mountain Arm and the north tip of the Promontory; the\r\neast edge coincides approximately with the east edge of the lake north\r\nof Southeast Arm (fig. 27). Also, the prominent bluffs north of the\r\nMadison River near Madison Junction mark part of the north rim of the\r\ncaldera.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CALDERA DEVELOPMENT. Schematic diagrams showing\r\n    idealized stages in the development of the Yellowstone caldera\r\n    600,000 years ago. The scales shown in Diagram A are approximately\r\n    the size of the features in Yellowstone. Although only one magma\r\n    chamber is pictured in the diagrams, two chambers were involved in\r\n    the Yellowstone eruption. (Based on information supplied by R. L.\r\n    Christiansen and H. R. Blank, Jr.) (Fig. 23)\r\n\r\n    A, A large magma chamber formed deep within the earth, and the\r\n    molten rock began to force its way slowly toward the surface. As it\r\n    pushed upward, it arched the overlying rocks into a broad dome. The\r\n    arching produced a series of concentric fractures, or a ring\r\n    fracture zone, around the crest of the dome. The fractures extended\r\n    downward toward the top of the magma chamber.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: B, The ring fractures eventually tapped the magma\r\n    chamber, the uppermost part of which contained a high proportion of\r\n    dissolved gases. With the sudden release of pressure, tremendous\r\n    amounts of hot gases and molten rock were erupted almost instantly.\r\n    The liquid solidified into pumice, ash, and dust as it was blown\r\n    out. Some of the dust and ash was blown high into the air and\r\n    carried along by the wind, but much of the debris moved outward\r\n    across the landscape as vast ash flows, covering thousands of square\r\n    miles very rapidly.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: C, The area overlying the blown-out part of the magma\r\n    chamber collapsed to form a gigantic caldera. The collapse took\r\n    place mostly along normal faults that developed from the fractures\r\n    in the ring fracture zone.

Molten rock again\r\nrose in both of them, and in a few hundreds or thousands of years the\r\noverlying caldera floor was domed over the two chambers. One of these\r\nprominent domes lies near Old Faithful and the other east of Hayden\r\nValley (figs. 22 and 23D). Soon, too, the magma found its way upward\r\nthrough the wide ring fracture zones encircling the caldera. Pouring out\r\nrather quietly from many openings (fig. 23D), the lavas flooded the\r\ncaldera floor and began to fill the still-smoldering pit. The first\r\nlavas appeared soon after the collapse 600,000 years ago, and the latest\r\nones only 60,000-75,000 years ago. The flows were confined chiefly to\r\nthe caldera proper, but here and there they spilled out across the rim,\r\nparticularly toward the southwestern part of the Park (fig. 28). Some\r\nflows also erupted along fractures outside the caldera, the most\r\nprominent flow being the very famous one at Obsidian Cliff (fig. 29).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: YELLOWSTONE LAKE.

(Fig. 27)]\r\n\r\nThe chief rock type in the lava flows is rhyolite, similar in\r\ncomposition to the welded tufts erupted earlier but different in other\r\nmajor characteristics. The rock, for example, shows much contorted\r\nlayering as evidence of having flowed as a thick liquid across the\r\nground (fig. 30). A coarse brecciated texture is also a common feature,\r\nwell shown by lavas along the Firehole Canyon drive (fig. 31). Locally,\r\nsome parts of the flows cooled so rapidly that few crystals formed, and\r\nthe lava solidified mainly into a natural glass (fig. 32).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: RADAR IMAGE of a part of southwestern Yellowstone\r\n    National Park.

Grouped within a major\r\nrock unit called the Plateau Rhyolite (fig. 5), they cover more than\r\n1,000 square miles. The gently rolling plateau surface of central\r\nYellowstone, broken here and there by clusters of low-lying hills and\r\nridges, is essentially the landscape that characterized the upper\r\nsurfaces of the lava flows soon after they cooled and solidified.\r\nNatural valleys formed between some of the adjacent flows, and in places\r\nstreams still follow these readymade channels. Rhyolite, in both lava\r\nflows and ash-flow tuffs, is by far the predominant rock type seen along\r\nthe Park roads.\r\n\r\nSeveral basalt flows were erupted along with the more common rhyolite\r\nflows, and in the vicinity of Tower Falls they form some of the most\r\nunusual rock units in the whole Park area (fig. 33). As the flows\r\ncooled, contraction cracks broke the basalt into a series of upright\r\nmany-sided columns; from a distance they appear as a solid row of\r\nfenceposts. They are now covered by younger rocks, but if one could see\r\nthe upper flat surface of the basalt layers where just the ends of the\r\ncolumns are sticking out, the pattern would be like that seen in a\r\nhoneycomb.\r\n\r\nDuring the eruptions of the Plateau Rhyolite, at least one relatively\r\nsmall caldera-making event occurred in the central Yellowstone region.\r\nThis “inner” caldera developed sometime between 125,000 and 200,000\r\nyears ago, forming the deep depression now filled by the West Thumb of\r\nYellowstone Lake (fig. 22). Like the main Yellowstone caldera, but on a\r\nmuch smaller scale, it formed as a direct result of the explosive\r\neruption of rhyolitic ash flows and subsequent collapse of an\r\noval-shaped area approximately 4 miles wide and 6 miles long. West Thumb\r\nis nearly the same size as Crater Lake, Oregon, which occupies one of\r\nthe world’s best-known calderas.\r\n\r\nWith the outpouring of the last lava flows 60,000-75,000 years ago, the\r\nforces of Quaternary volcanism finally died down. The hot-water and\r\nsteam activity, however, still remains as a vivid reminder of\r\nYellowstone’s volcanic past. But who can say even now that we are\r\nwitnessing the final stage of volcanism? Someday, quite conceivably,\r\nthere might be yet another outburst of molten rock—only time, of course,\r\nwill tell.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TWO LEDGES OF BASALT spectacularly exposed in the\r\n    east wall of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone at The Narrows near\r\n    Tower Falls.

During the latter part of the Tertiary Period, erosion, too,\r\nhad begun to make its own deep marks. But only in the last 100,000 years\r\nor so have the powerful exterior forces of the earth—chiefly running\r\nwater and moving ice—had a virtually free hand in shaping the Park’s\r\nlandscape. Nevertheless, in this short period of time they have wrought\r\nprofound changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Glaciation\r\n\r\nA giant boulder of Precambrian gneiss lies among the trees beside the\r\nroad leading to Inspiration Point on the north rim of the Grand Canyon\r\nof the Yellowstone (fig. 34). This boulder, measuring approximately\r\n24×20×18 feet and weighing at least 500 tons, is of considerable\r\ninterest, not so much for its great size but because it is completely\r\nout-of-place in its present surroundings. The boulder rests on rhyolite\r\nlava flows of Quaternary age, at least 15 miles from the nearest\r\noutcrops of the ancient gneiss to the north and northeast. Obviously,\r\nthis seemingly immovable chunk of rock was pushed or carried a long way\r\nby some very powerful transporting agent before it was finally dropped.\r\nA natural force of such magnitude could only have been exerted by moving\r\nice; in fact, no further proof than this one boulder is needed for us to\r\nconclude beyond question that glaciers once existed in Yellowstone.\r\nThere is, to be sure, much additional evidence that the Park region was\r\nextensively glaciated. Deposits of out-of-place boulders (_glacial\r\nerratics_), like the one mentioned above, are found nearly everywhere\r\n(fig. 35) and the mountains and high valleys still bear the vivid scars\r\nof ice sculpturing (figs. 36 and 37).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GIANT BOULDER (glacial erratic) of Precambrian gneiss\r\n    near Inspiration Point on the north rim of the Grand Canyon. The\r\n    boulder, measuring 24×20×18 feet and weighing more than 500 tons,\r\n    was dropped at this locality by glacial ice; it now rests on the\r\n    much younger Plateau Rhyolite. The distance that the boulder was\r\n    carried or pushed was at least 15 miles. (Fig. 34)]\r\n\r\nThe principal requirement for the formation of glaciers is simple: more\r\nsnow has to accumulate during the winter than is melted during the\r\nsummer. If this condition continues for a long enough period of time\r\n(measured in centuries), the snow compacts to ice, and extensive\r\nicefields grow until they finally begin to move under their own weight,\r\nthereby becoming glaciers. Records show that the average year-round\r\ntemperature is 32°-33°F along Yellowstone Lake, 35°F at Old Faithful,\r\nand 39°F at Mammoth. Each winter, snow accumulates to depths of 5-10\r\nfeet throughout much of the Park. If the average annual temperatures\r\nwere to decrease a few degrees or the yearly snowfall were to increase a\r\nfoot or so, either change could possibly herald the beginning of another\r\nice age in the Yellowstone region.\r\n\r\nYellowstone was glaciated at least three times. These glaciations are,\r\nfrom oldest to youngest, the pre-Bull Lake, Bull Lake, and Pinedale.\r\nTheir precise age and duration are imperfectly known, but estimates\r\nbased on a few radiometric determinations are: (1) the oldest glaciation\r\n(pre-Bull Lake glaciation) began more than 300,000 years ago and ended\r\nbetween 180,000 and 200,000 years ago; (2) Bull Lake Glaciation began\r\nabout 125,000 years ago and ended more than 45,000 years ago; (3)\r\nPinedale Glaciation began about 25,000 years ago and ended about 8,500\r\nyears ago. The pre-Bull Lake and Bull Lake are known only from scattered\r\ndeposits of rock debris (_glacial moraines_) and other features, but the\r\ndistribution of these deposits indicates that glaciers were widespread\r\nthroughout the region and occurred both between and during eruptions of\r\nthe Plateau Rhyolite. The effects of the Pinedale glaciers, on the other\r\nhand, are obvious in many parts of the Park, and the history of this\r\nyoungest glacial cycle (described below) is known in much greater detail\r\nthan that of the two older ones.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of Pinedale Glaciation, an enormous icefield built\r\nup in the high Absaroka Range southeast of the Park area. A glacier, fed\r\nby this icefield, flowed northward down the upper Yellowstone valley and\r\ninto the basin now occupied by Yellowstone Lake. At about the same time,\r\nanother great icefield formed in the mountains north of the Park and\r\nsent long tongues of ice southward toward the lower Yellowstone and\r\nLamar River valleys. Smaller valley glaciers flowed westward out of the\r\nAbsaroka Range along the east edge of the Park, and still others formed\r\nalong the main ridges and valleys of the Gallatin Range, in the\r\nnorthwestern part of the Park. Thus, many huge masses of ice from the\r\nnorth, east, and southeast converged and met in the Park. At this stage,\r\nprobably about 15,000 years ago, only the west edge of the Park, and\r\nperhaps a few of the highest peaks and ridges within the Park, remained\r\nfree of ice. It is interesting to note that although ice moved across\r\nand buried the ancestral Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, it did not\r\nflow down and scour the canyon (fig. 36). If it had, the canyon would\r\nlook much different than it does today (fig. 41).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GLACIATED TERRAIN along the Northeast Entrance road.\r\n    The boulders, many of them measuring 10 feet across or more, were\r\n    carried into the area by ice flowing down Slough Creek from\r\n    mountains north of the Park during the Pinedale Glaciation. As the\r\n    glaciers melted, the boulders were left stranded in hummocky,\r\n    morainal deposits. Shallow depressions in the irregular topography\r\n    are now commonly filled by small ponds. (Fig. 35)]\r\n\r\nFor the next 10,000 years, the ice thickened and spread out over more\r\nand more of the Park area. The mass centered over the Yellowstone Lake\r\nbasin grew to a depth of 3,000 feet or more and dominated the entire\r\nscene; it formed a broad “mountain” of ice which became so high that it\r\ncaused more snow to fall upon itself and was cold enough to prevent much\r\nof this snow from melting. Eventually the Pinedale glaciers covered\r\nabout 90 percent of Yellowstone (fig. 38).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CANYON PROFILES. Typical profiles of a canyon cut by\r\n    a stream (A) and of a canyon gouged by a glacier (B). Glacial\r\n    cirques (C) are shown at the head and high on the side of the\r\n    glaciated valley.

During several episodes of glaciation, this\r\n    steep-walled amphitheaterlike valley was cut and filled by ice which\r\n    fed glaciers moving downslope to the lower right. The cirque floor\r\n    is now covered by a thick deposit of rock rubble underlain in part\r\n    by ice, and the whole mass is still moving slowly downhill as a rock\r\n    glacier. The dark rock at lower right is part of the Electric Peak\r\n    stock, composed of diorite (fig. 20) and other kinds of intrusive\r\n    igneous rocks. The rocks in the cirque walls are chiefly Cretaceous\r\n    shales (light to moderately dark color) with thin sills of igneous\r\n    rock (very dark color).

(Fig. 37)]\r\n\r\nAfter their maximum advance, the Pinedale glaciers began to melt,\r\nleaving behind the rock debris they had gouged from the landscape and\r\nhad pushed or carried along with them. These glacial moraines are now\r\nfound in many areas throughout the Park. In places, glacial ice and (or)\r\nrock debris formed natural dams across stream valleys, thereby\r\nimpounding lakes. Parts of Hayden Valley, for example, contain layers of\r\nvery fine sand, silt, and clay several tens of feet thick (fig. 39) that\r\naccumulated along the bottom of a large lake. This lake formed behind a\r\nglacial dam across the Yellowstone River near Upper Falls. Some of the\r\nglacial dams broke and released water catastrophically, causing giant\r\nfloods; the occurrence of one such flood is particularly evident along\r\nthe Yellowstone River valley near Gardiner, Montana.\r\n\r\nBy about 12,000 years ago the thick Pinedale ice sheet had melted\r\nentirely from the Yellowstone Lake basin and most other areas of the\r\nPark, although valley glaciers continued to exist in the mountains until\r\nabout 8,500 years ago. Then, following a short period of total\r\ndisappearance, small icefields formed again in the heads of some of the\r\nhigher mountain valleys. Since the melting of the Pinedale ice, however,\r\nnone has descended as a glacier into the lower stretches of the valleys.\r\nEven though a few snowfields persist locally throughout the summers\r\n(except during the warmest years), no glaciers exist in the Park at the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EXTENT OF ICE in Yellowstone National Park during the\r\n    maximum spreading of the Pinedale glaciers, probably about 15,000\r\n    years ago.

Located across the Continental Divide, the Park feeds two\r\nof the most extensive drainage systems in the nation—(1) the Missouri\r\nRiver system (and ultimately the Mississippi River) on the Atlantic\r\nside, via the Yellowstone, Madison, and Gallatin Rivers, and (2) the\r\nColumbia River system on the Pacific side, via the Snake River (fig. 1).\r\nThese streams are fed by an annual precipitation which averages about 17\r\ninches at Old Faithful and Mammoth, but which is considerably greater in\r\nthe mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nMany stretches of the main river valleys in Yellowstone are broad and\r\nflat bottomed. In these, the stream gradients range from about 10 to 30\r\nfeet per mile, and there is little erosion going on at present (Hayden\r\nValley is a good example, fig. 4). But here and there the gradients are\r\nsteeper, and the valleys are narrow and rugged. In some places these\r\nstreams drop 50 or even 100 feet per mile, and the fast-moving waters\r\nhave carved deep V-shaped gorges (fig. 36).\r\n\r\nWaterfalls, features for which Yellowstone is also justly famous (fig.\r\n40), generally result from abrupt differences in rock hardness. If a\r\nstream flows over rocks that are more resistant to erosion than the\r\nrocks immediately downstream, a ledge or bench will form across the\r\nstreambed at that place because the less resistant rocks are worn away\r\nfaster. And, as the ledge becomes higher, the softer downstream rocks\r\nwill erode even faster. A true waterfall is one in which there is a\r\nfree, vertical fall of water. If the ledge or ledges form only a rough,\r\nsteep runway in the streambed, then the term “rapids” or “cascades” is\r\nmore appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe existence of many waterfalls in Yellowstone today is due in large\r\npart to the fact that, because of recent volcanism and glaciation, much\r\nof the region’s topography is very young in terms of geologic time.\r\nStreams, even some of the largest ones, have not had enough time to wear\r\naway all the features that may produce waterfalls, cascades, or rapids\r\nalong their channels. This is particularly true along the margins of\r\nlava flows, where there are sharp dropoffs between the tops of the flows\r\nand the lower ground beyond. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and the\r\nUpper and Lower Falls, well illustrate the erosive power of running\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone\r\n\r\nExcept for Old Faithful, the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone is probably\r\nthe best known and most talked about and photographed feature in the\r\nPark (fig. 41). Although not so deep or wide as some of the other great\r\ncanyons in America, its sheer ruggedness and beauty are breathtaking.\r\nHere the aptness of the name “Yellowstone” can be fully appreciated and\r\nunderstood, for the viewer is at once engulfed in a sea of yellow hues\r\nstreaked and tinted with various shades of red and brown.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GRAND CANYON AND LOWER FALLS of the Yellowstone\r\n    River, as viewed upstream (southwest) from Artists Point on the\r\n    south rim.

This, of course, is\r\nnot the way the canyon formed. Nevertheless, it is apparent that certain\r\nunusual conditions caused the river, after winding slowly through\r\nflat-floored Hayden Valley for about 13 miles, to cut a precipitous\r\ngorge 1,000-1,500 feet deep and 20 miles long (fig. 42C). A full\r\nexplanation must be based on all the many events surrounding the\r\neruption of the Yellowstone Tuff, the collapse of the Yellowstone\r\ncaldera, the outpouring of the Plateau Rhyolite, and the various\r\nepisodes of glaciation. Geologic studies show that all these events took\r\nplace while the canyon was being cut, and that each one played an\r\nimportant role in its development. Hot-water and steam activity likewise\r\nwas a significant factor. However, despite its many complexities, the\r\nhistory of the Grand Canyon can be divided into a few major stages, as\r\noutlined below:\r\n\r\n  1. From more than 2,000,000 years ago to about 600,000 years ago, a\r\n  shallow canyon was gradually being cut into the Absaroka volcanic\r\n  sequence by the ancestral Yellowstone River as it eroded headward from\r\n  a point near the present confluence of the Yellowstone and Lamar\r\n  Rivers (fig. 33). By the time of the climactic volcanic eruption in\r\n  central Yellowstone 600,000 years ago, the head of the “old” canyon\r\n  probably had been eroded southward nearly to the place where the north\r\n  rim of the Yellowstone caldera was to form later (fig. 42A). This\r\n  point now lies about 5 miles below Lower Falls.\r\n\r\n  2. Ash-flow tuffs that were erupted 600,000 years ago filled the “old”\r\n  canyon, and the river recarved its channel, chiefly along its previous\r\n  course.\r\n\r\n  3. A large lake formed behind (south of) the north rim of the caldera,\r\n  the damming resulting in part from lava flows of Plateau Rhyolite that\r\n  poured out across the caldera floor in this area between 600,000 and\r\n  500,000 years ago. Eventually the lake rose and spilled northward into\r\n  the head of the “old” canyon, causing additional downcutting in what\r\n  is now the lower 15-mile stretch of the canyon.\r\n\r\n  4. As the lake emptied, the river began to erode upstream into the\r\n  thick rhyolite lava flows toward the present site of Lower Falls; the\r\n  process was very similar to that of a common stream gully eroding\r\n  headward into a hillside. At a stage somewhat more than 300,000 years\r\n  ago, the head of the canyon probably lay near the falls, and the river\r\n  had cut a channel 400-600 feet deep along this upper 5-mile stretch\r\n  (fig. 42B).\r\n\r\n  5. Approximately 300,000 years ago the canyon area was covered by ice\r\n  during pre-Bull Lake glaciation. During and after the retreat of this\r\n  ice, sediments accumulated in a lake that occupied the upper reaches\r\n  of the canyon between the present site of Upper Falls and Inspiration\r\n  Point. Subsequently, very little downcutting was accomplished until\r\n  about 150,000-125,000 years ago, when the canyon was eroded nearly to\r\n  its present depth.\r\n\r\n  6. Canyon development was further interrupted by the advance and\r\n  retreat of glaciers during Bull Lake and Pinedale Glaciations. During\r\n  and since the melting of the Pinedale glaciers about 12,000 years ago,\r\n  the canyon has attained its present depth, and its walls have acquired\r\n  much of their picturesque erosional form. The Yellowstone River now\r\n  maintains a fairly uniform gradient (60-80 feet per mile) throughout\r\n  the 20-mile-long gorge, even though different segments of the canyon\r\n  were cut at different times and through different kinds of rocks (fig.\r\n  42C).\r\n\r\nThe spectacular erosional development in the upper 5-mile segment of the\r\nGrand Canyon, which is the only part seen by most Park visitors, except\r\nfor the very lower end near Tower Falls (fig. 33), has taken place\r\nmostly within the past 150,000-125,000 years. One reason for such a\r\nrapid rate of erosion stems from the fact that this part of the canyon\r\noverlies one of the wide ring fracture zones of the Yellowstone caldera\r\n(fig. 22). The fracture zone extends to great depth, providing a ready\r\navenue of travel for the upflow of hot water and steam rising in the\r\nYellowstone thermal system, as described in the following chapter.\r\nThrough many thousands of years, the upward percolation of the hot\r\nfluids has caused severe chemical and physical changes (known as\r\n_hydrothermal alteration_) in the rhyolite lava flows. One spectacular\r\nresult of the alteration has been the change from the normal brown and\r\ngray color of the rhyolites to the bright yellow and other colorful hues\r\nnow seen in the canyon walls (as well as in many other places throughout\r\nthe Park). Another significant result of alteration has been the\r\nweakening of the rocks; that is, the altered rocks are softer and less\r\nresistant to erosion than unaltered rocks. Hence, the river has been\r\nable to erode these softer rocks, upstream to Lower Falls, at a very\r\nrapid rate.\r\n\r\nThe position of Lower Falls, as might be expected, coincides with a\r\nchange from highly altered to less altered rhyolite; the difference in\r\nthe erosion rates of the two kinds of rocks here is self-evident (figs.\r\n41 and 42C). The position of Upper Falls is likewise closely controlled\r\nby differences in rock hardnesses. The rhyolites on the upstream side\r\nare hard and dense, whereas those on the downstream side contain a high\r\nproportion of volcanic glass which causes them to be more easily eroded\r\n(fig. 42C).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Swan family.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: COMMON KINDS OF THERMAL FEATURES in Yellowstone\r\n    National Park.

The unusual\r\nconcentration of geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles provides\r\nthat special drawing card which has, for the past century, made the Park\r\none of the world’s foremost natural attractions.\r\n\r\nTo count all the individual thermal features in Yellowstone would be\r\nvirtually impossible. Various estimates range from 2,500 to 10,000,\r\ndepending on how many of the smaller features are included. They are\r\nscattered through many regions of the Park, but most are clustered in a\r\nfew areas called geyser basins, where there are continuous displays of\r\nintense thermal activity. (See frontispiece.) The “steam” that can be\r\nseen in thermal areas is actually fog or water droplets condensed from\r\nsteam; so the appearance of individual geyser basins depends largely on\r\nair temperature and humidity. On a warm, dry summer day, for example,\r\nthe activity may seem very weak (fig. 44), except where individual\r\ngeysers are erupting. On cold or very humid days, however, “steam”\r\nplumes are seen rising from every quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     How a thermal system operates\r\n\r\nAn essential ingredient for thermal activity is heat. A body of buried\r\nmolten rock, such as the one that produced volcanic eruptions in\r\nYellowstone as late as 60,000 to 75,000 years ago, takes a long time to\r\ncool. During cooling, tremendous quantities of heat are transmitted by\r\nconduction into the solid rocks surrounding the magma chamber (fig. 45).\r\nEventually the whole region becomes much hotter than non-volcanic areas\r\n(fig. 46). Normally, rock temperatures increase about 1°F per 100 feet\r\nof depth in the earth’s crust, but in the thermally active areas of\r\nYellowstone the rate of temperature increase is much greater. The amount\r\nof heat given off by the Upper Geyser Basin, for example, is 800 times\r\nthe amount given off by normal (nonthermal) areas of the same size. This\r\nexcess heat is enough to melt 1½ tons of ice per second! And, contrary\r\nto popular opinion, the underground temperatures have not cooled\r\nmeasurably in the 100 years that records have been kept on the thermal\r\nactivity in the Park. In fact, geologic studies indicate that very high\r\nheat flows have continued for at least the past 40,000 years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NORRIS GEYSER BASIN, as viewed northward from the\r\n    Norris Museum. This is one of the most active thermal areas in\r\n    Yellowstone, but the photograph was taken on a warm dry summer day\r\n    when little hot-water and steam activity was visible from a\r\n    distance. Clouds of water droplets (the visible “steam” in thermal\r\n    areas) normally form only when the air is cool and (or) moist. The\r\n    floor of the basin is covered by a nearly solid layer of hot-spring\r\n    deposits. (Fig. 44)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: HEAT FLOW AND SURFACE WATER.

Note especially the sharp “image” of Old\r\n    Faithful. (Image courtesy of National Aeronautics and Space\r\n    Administration.) (Fig. 46)]\r\n\r\nA second, equally essential ingredient for thermal activity is water.\r\nMany thousands of gallons are discharged by the hot springs and geysers\r\nin Yellowstone every minute—where does all this water come from? Studies\r\nshow that nearly all the water originates above ground as rain or snow\r\n(meteoric water; fig. 45), and that very little comes from the\r\nunderlying magma (magmatic water).\r\n\r\nThe mechanism for heating the water, on the other hand, is a matter of\r\nsome uncertainty. Until a few years ago the heating was assumed to occur\r\nnear the ground surface and to be caused by hot magmatic gases (mostly\r\nsteam) rising from the underlying magma chamber. Deep wells drilled\r\nrecently in many thermal areas throughout the world (including research\r\ndrill holes in Yellowstone), however, suggest a better explanation.\r\nAccording to this explanation, the surface water enters underground\r\npassages (fractures and faults) and circulates to great depths—as much\r\nas 5,000-10,000 feet in some areas (fig. 45)—there to become heated far\r\nabove its surface boiling point. Research drill holes in Yellowstone,\r\nfor example, have demonstrated that water of surface origin exists at\r\nall depths at least to the maximum drilled (1,088 feet), and that the\r\nwater reaches temperatures up to at least 465°F. The increase in\r\ntemperature with depth causes a corresponding decrease in the weight\r\n(density) of the water. Because of this, the hot, “lighter,” water\r\nbegins to rise again toward the ground surface, pushed upward by the\r\ncolder, “heavier,” near-surface water which sinks to keep the water\r\nchannels filled. Thus is set into motion a giant _convection current_\r\nwhich operates continuously to supply very hot water to the thermal\r\nareas (fig. 45). Just how deep the waters circulate in Yellowstone no\r\none really knows; as a guess, the depth probably is at least 1 or 2\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe effect of pressure on the boiling temperature of water also plays a\r\nvital role in thermal activity. In a body of water, the pressure at the\r\nsurface is that exerted by the weight of air above it (_atmospheric\r\npressure_). Water under these conditions boils at 212°F at sea level and\r\nat about 199°F at the elevation of most of the geyser basins in\r\nYellowstone. However, water at depth not only is subjected to\r\natmospheric pressure but also bears the added weight of the overlying\r\nwater. Under such additional pressures, water boils only when the\r\ntemperature is raised above its surface boiling point. In a well 100\r\nfeet deep at sea level, for example, the water at the bottom would have\r\nto be heated to 288°F before it will boil. Thus it follows that in the\r\nunderground “workings” of hot springs or geysers, (1) The deepest water\r\nis subjected to the greatest pressures, and (2) these deeper waters (in\r\nYellowstone) must be heated well above 199°F before they can actually\r\nbegin to boil. By this same reasoning but in reverse, if the pressure is\r\nreleased, which happens as the water rises toward the ground surface,\r\nthe “hotter-than-boiling” water will then begin to boil. The boiling\r\nwill be rather quiet if the pressure is released gradually, as in most\r\nhot springs. But if the pressure is released suddenly, boiling may\r\nbecome so violent that much of the water flashes explosively into steam,\r\nexpanding to several hundred times its normal volume. This expansion\r\nprovides the necessary energy for geyser eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Hot-spring deposits and algae\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MOUND OF SINTER at Castle Geyser, Upper Geyser Basin.\r\n    Lower part of mound has well-defined layers probably deposited by\r\n    normal hot springs. The upper, irregular part resulted from the\r\n    vigorous eruptions characteristic of geysers and marks a change in\r\n    the local hot-spring activity. (Fig. 47)]\r\n\r\nNearly all geysers and many hot springs build mounds or terraces of\r\nmineral deposits; some are so unusual in form that descriptive names\r\nhave been given to them, such as Castle Geyser (fig. 47). These deposits\r\nare generally made up of many very thin layers of rock. Each layer\r\nrepresents a crust or film of rock-forming mineral which was originally\r\ndissolved in hot water as it flowed through the underground rocks, and\r\nwhich was then precipitated as the water spread out over the surrounding\r\nground surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TERRACES OF TRAVERTINE at Opal Springs, Mammoth Hot\r\n    Springs area. (Fig. 48)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Closeup view shows layered and porous nature of the\r\n    travertine.]\r\n\r\nIn all major thermal areas of the Park, with the exception of Mammoth\r\nHot Springs, most of the material being deposited is _sinter_ (the kind\r\nfound around geysers is popularly called _geyserite_). Its chief\r\nconstituent is silica (the same as in quartz and in ordinary window\r\nglass). At Mammoth, the deposit is _travertine_ (fig. 48), which\r\nconsists almost entirely of calcium carbonate. The material deposited at\r\nany given place commonly reflects the predominant kind of rock through\r\nwhich the hot water has passed during its underground travels. At\r\nMammoth Hot Springs the water passes through thick beds of limestone\r\n(which is calcium carbonate), but in other areas the main rock type\r\nthrough which the water percolates is rhyolite, a rock rich in silica.\r\n\r\nThrough centuries of intense activity, layers of sinter have built up on\r\nthe floors of the geyser basins (fig. 44); these deposits are generally\r\nless than 10 feet thick. In one drill hole at Mammoth, deposits of\r\ntravertine extend to a depth of 250 feet. Dead trees and other kinds of\r\nvegetation whose life processes have been choked off by the heat, water,\r\nand precipitated minerals of hot-spring activity are a common sight in\r\nmany places (fig. 51).\r\n\r\nBoth travertine and sinter are white to gray. Around active hot springs,\r\nhowever, the terraces that are constantly under water may be brightly\r\ncolored (figs. 43 and 49) because they are coated by microscopic plants\r\ncalled _algae_. These organisms, which thrive in hot water at\r\ntemperatures up to about 170°F, are green, yellow, and brown. Oxides of\r\niron and manganese also contribute to the coloring in some parts of the\r\nthermal areas. The delicate blue color of many pools, however, results\r\nfrom the reflection of light off the pool walls and back through the\r\ndeep clear water (fig. 43). Other pools are yellow because they contain\r\nsulfur, or are green from the combined influence of yellow sulfur and\r\n“blue” water.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ALGAL-COLORED TERRACES lining the west bank of the\r\n    Firehole River at Midway Geyser Basin. Algae are microscopic plants\r\n    that grow profusely on rocks covered by hot water at temperatures up\r\n    to about 170°F. (Fig. 49)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Hot springs and geysers\r\n\r\nHot springs occur where the rising hot waters of a thermal system issue\r\nfrom the ground-level openings of the feeder conduits (fig. 45). By far\r\nthe greatest numbers discharge water and steam in a relatively steady\r\nnoneruptive manner, although they vary considerably in individual\r\nbehavior. Depending upon pressure, water temperature, rate of upflow,\r\nheat supply, and arrangement and size of underground passages, some hot\r\nsprings boil violently and emit dense clouds of vapor whereas in others\r\nthe water quietly wells up with little agitation from escaping steam. In\r\nsome hot springs, however, the underground channels are too narrow or\r\nthe upflow of very hot water and steam is too great to permit a steady\r\ndischarge; periodic eruptions then result. These special kinds of\r\nsprings are called “geysers” (from the Icelandic word _geysir_, meaning\r\nto “gush” or “rage”). At least 200 geysers, of which about 60 play to a\r\nheight of 10 feet or more, occur in Yellowstone National Park; this is\r\nmore than in any other region of the world.\r\n\r\nHow does a geyser work? We cannot, of course, observe the inner plumbing\r\nof a geyser, except for that part which is seen by looking into its\r\nuppermost “well.” Deeper levels directly below the “well” can be probed\r\nby scientific instruments to some extent, and research drilling in some\r\nparts of the geyser basins also provides much useful information. The\r\navailable information suggests that the plumbing system of a geyser (1)\r\nlies close to the ground surface, generally no deeper than a few hundred\r\nfeet; (2) consists of a tube, commonly nearly vertical, that connects to\r\nchambers, side channels, or layers of porous rock, where substantial\r\namounts of water can be stored; and (3) connects downward through the\r\ncentral tube and side channels to narrow conduits that rise from the\r\ndeepwater source of the main thermal system.\r\n\r\nConsidering a geyser system as described above and applying what is\r\nknown about the behavior of water and steam, we can understand what\r\ncauses a natural thermal eruption. Figure 50 shows diagrammatically the\r\nsuccession of events believed to occur during the typical eruptive cycle\r\nof a geyser such as Old Faithful.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A GEYSER IN ACTION. Photographs of successive stages\r\n    in the eruption of Old Faithful illustrate what probably happens\r\n    during a natural geyser eruption. The underground plumbing is\r\n    diagrammatic and does not reflect any specific knowledge of Old\r\n    Faithful’s system. Direction of flow of water is shown by arrows.\r\n    (Based on information supplied by D. E. White, L. J. P. Muffler, R.\r\n    O. Fournier, and A. H. Truesdell.) (Fig. 50)\r\n\r\n    Stage 1 (Recovery or recharge stage). After an eruption, the partly\r\n    emptied geyser tubes and chambers fill again with water. Hot water\r\n    enters through a feeder conduit from below, and cooler water\r\n    percolates in from side channels nearer the surface. Steam bubbles\r\n    (with some other gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide)\r\n    start to form in upflowing currents, as a decrease in pressure\r\n    causes a corresponding decrease in boiling temperature. At first the\r\n    bubbles condense in the cooler, near-surface water that is not yet\r\n    at boiling temperature, but eventually all water is heated enough\r\n    that the bubbles will no longer condense or “dissolve.”]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stage 2 (Preliminary eruption stage). As the rising\r\n    gas bubbles grow in size and number, they tend to clog certain parts\r\n    of the geyser tube, perhaps at some narrow or constricted point such\r\n    as at A. When this happens, the expanding steam abruptly forces its\r\n    way upward through the system and causes some of the water to\r\n    discharge from the surface vent in preliminary spurts. The deeper\r\n    part of the system, however, is not yet quite hot enough for\r\n    “triggering.”]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stage 3 (Full eruption stage). Finally, a preliminary\r\n    spurt “unloads” enough water (with resulting reduction in pressure)\r\n    to start a chain reaction deeper in the system. Larger amounts of\r\n    water in the side chambers and pore spaces begin to flash into\r\n    steam, and the geyser rapidly surges into full eruption.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stage 4 (Steam stage). When most of the extra energy\r\n    is spent, and the geyser tubes and chambers are nearly empty, the\r\n    eruption ceases. Some water remains in local pockets and pore\r\n    spaces, continuing to make steam for a short while. Thereafter the\r\n    system begins to fill again, and the eruptive cycle starts anew.]\r\n\r\nNo two geysers have the same size, shape, and arrangement of tubes and\r\nchambers. Also, some geysers, such as Great Fountain, have large surface\r\npools not present in cone-type geysers such as Old Faithful. Hence, each\r\ngeyser behaves differently from all others in frequency of eruption,\r\nlength of individual eruptions, and amount of water discharged. Geysers\r\nmay also vary in their own behavior as their plumbing features change\r\nthrough the years. The great amount of energy that builds up in some of\r\nthem from time to time creates enough explosive force to shatter parts\r\nof the plumbing system, thereby causing a change in their eruptive\r\nbehavior. In fact, some geyser eruptions have been so violent that large\r\nchunks of rock have been exploded out of the ground and scattered around\r\nthe surrounding area (fig. 51). With time, the precipitation of minerals\r\nmay partly seal a tube or chamber, gradually altering the eruptive\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nDespite all the variable factors involved in geyser eruptions, and all\r\nthe changes that can take place from time to time to alter the pattern\r\nof those eruptions, several of the Yellowstone geysers function\r\nregularly, day after day, week after week, and year after year. Within\r\nthis group of regulars is the most famous feature of all—Old\r\nFaithful—which has not missed an eruption in all the many decades that\r\nit has been under close observation (fig. 52). We can only conclude that\r\nnature has provided this incredible geyser with a stable plumbing system\r\nthat is just right to trigger delightfully graceful eruptions at\r\nclose-enough time intervals to suit the convenience of all Park\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Mudpots\r\n\r\nMudpots are among the most fascinating and interesting of the\r\nYellowstone thermal features. They are also a type of hot spring, but\r\none for which water is in short supply. Whatever water is available\r\nbecomes thoroughly mixed with clay and other fine undissolved mineral\r\nmatter. The mud is generally gray, black, white, or cream colored, but\r\nsome is tinted pale pink and red by iron compounds (fig. 43); hence, the\r\npicturesque term “paint pots” is commonly used.\r\n\r\nMudpots form in places where the upflowing thermal fluids have\r\nchemically decomposed the surface rocks to form clay. Such small amounts\r\nof water are involved, however, that the surface discharge is not great\r\nenough to flush the clay out of the spring. Caldrons of mud of all\r\nconsistencies result, from the very thin soupy material in many mudpots\r\nto the almost hard-baked material in the less active features. Some\r\nmudpots expel pellets of very thick viscous mud which build up circular\r\ncones or mounds; this type is commonly called a “mud volcano” (fig. 53).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SEISMIC GEYSER, showing rock rubble blown out during\r\n    an explosive thermal eruption. Note the trees that have been killed\r\n    by the heat and eruptive activity. According to George D. Marler of\r\n    the National Park Service, this geyser developed from cracks caused\r\n    by the Hebgen Lake Earthquake of August 17, 1959. (Fig. 51)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: OLD FAITHFUL IN FULL ERUPTION. The interval between\r\n    eruptions averages about 65 minutes, but it varies from 33 to 96\r\n    minutes. The time lapse between eruptions can be predicted rather\r\n    closely, mainly on the basis of the length of time involved in the\r\n    previous eruption. If an eruption lasted 4 minutes, for example,\r\n    this means that a certain amount of water emptied from the geyser’s\r\n    chambers and that a certain length of time will be necessary to\r\n    recharge the system for the next eruption. But if the previous\r\n    eruption lasted only 3 minutes, less time will be needed for\r\n    recharge, and the next eruption will occur sooner. (The above\r\n    discussion is based primarily on many years of observation and study\r\n    of Old Faithful by George D. Marler and other observers of the\r\n    National Park Service; photograph courtesy of Sgt. James E. Jensen,\r\n    U.S. Air Force.) (Fig. 52)]\r\n\r\nMudpot activity differs from season to season throughout the year\r\nbecause of the varying amounts of rain and snow that fall upon the\r\nsurface to further moisten the mud. Accordingly, mudpots are commonly\r\ndrier in late summer and early fall than they are from winter through\r\nearly summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fumaroles\r\n\r\nFumaroles (from the Latin word _fumus_, meaning “smoke”) are those\r\nfeatures that discharge only steam and other gases such as carbon\r\ndioxide and hydrogen sulfide; hence, they are commonly called “steam\r\nvents.” Usually these features are perched on a hillside or other high\r\nground above the level of the flowing springs. In many fumaroles,\r\nhowever, water can be heard boiling violently at some lower, unseen\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Thermal explosions\r\n\r\nA few features present in the Yellowstone thermal areas display evidence\r\nthat extremely violent thermal explosions occurred in the past,\r\nparticularly during Pinedale Glaciation, about 15,000 years ago. Such\r\nexplosion features, of which Pocket Basin in Lower Geyser Basin is a\r\ngood example, appear as craterlike depressions a few tens of feet to as\r\nmuch as 5,000 feet across surrounded by rims of rock fragments that were\r\nblown out of the craters. The underground mechanism causing the\r\nexplosions was similar to that of geysers, but in these special cases\r\nthe energy remained bottled-up until a very critical explosive stage was\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThe best explanation for Pocket Basin and related features is that the\r\nground above the sites of the explosions was weighted down by the water\r\nof small lakes which had formed in melted-out pockets of glacial ice.\r\nSuch localized melting of the glaciers would occur where the ice was in\r\ndirect contact with underlying thermal features. A rapid draining of the\r\nlake waters would then produce a sudden release of pressure over the hot\r\narea, resulting in an unusually violent thermal eruption.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MUD VOLCANO near Pocket Basin in the Lower Geyser\r\n    Basin. The mud is formed by chemical decomposition of the rocks\r\n    chiefly by the action of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid. The\r\n    splatter, 5-6 feet high, is caused by the escaping gases. (Fig. 53)]\r\n\r\n\r\n              Faulting and its control of thermal activity\r\n\r\nMost of the major thermal areas of Yellowstone are related to the ring\r\nfracture zones of the Yellowstone caldera (fig. 22). Many deep-seated\r\nfaults and fractures in these zones are presumably situated above the\r\nmain source of heat of the thermal system. Thus, they provide convenient\r\navenues of travel for underground waters to circulate to great depths,\r\nthere to become heated and then rise to the earth’s surface (fig. 45). A\r\nfew areas like Mammoth Hot Springs and Norris Geyser Basin, on the other\r\nhand, are not within the ring fracture zones of the caldera. In these\r\nareas, the thermal activity is commonly related to other prominent zones\r\nof faulting which also afford readymade channelways for the circulation\r\nof hot water and steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Earthquakes\r\n\r\n\r\nEarthquakes occur frequently in areas of active faulting and volcanism;\r\nthey are caused by sudden movements between adjacent blocks of the\r\nearth’s crust as the crust adjusts to new conditions and pressures.\r\nBecause of its volcanic history and the fact that very recent fault\r\nmovements have occurred there, it is not surprising that Yellowstone is\r\nan especially active earthquake area. Sensitive instruments\r\n(_seismographs_) record an average of about five earth tremors daily in\r\nand around the Park, and on rare occasions they may record 100 tremors\r\nor more in a single day. Nearly all these tremors are so slight that\r\nthey cannot be felt by man, but at times, perhaps only once in a human\r\nlifetime, one is triggered with high enough intensity to sharply draw\r\nour attention to the very real earthquake potential that exists\r\nconstantly in this geologically active area. Such a high-intensity quake\r\noccurred in the Yellowstone region near midnight on August 17, 1959.\r\n\r\nThe Hebgen Lake Earthquake, as it is known, was centered in the Madison\r\nValley along the west boundary of Yellowstone National Park about 12\r\nmiles north of the town of West Yellowstone, Montana (fig. 1). As a\r\nresult of the quake, a 200-square-mile area, occupied in part by the\r\nHebgen Lake reservoir, subsided a foot or more; maximum subsidence was\r\n20 feet. Movements of several feet along old faults in the highlands\r\nalong the north side of the valley produced fresh scars several miles\r\nlong (fig. 54). Moreover, the severe vibrations that rocked the\r\nsurrounding countryside caused the loose silt, sand, and gravel of the\r\nvalley floor to slip and become “faulted” in many places. By far the\r\nmost drastic result was the shaking loose of a huge landslide in the\r\nvicinity of the Rock Creek campground about 25 miles downstream on the\r\nMadison River from the west boundary of the Park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE. Severe damage caused by\r\n    reactivation of a fault during the Hebgen Lake Earthquake of August\r\n    17, 1959. The building is on the Blarneystone Ranch, about 10 miles\r\n    north of West Yellowstone, Montana, and 1½ miles west of the west\r\n    boundary of Yellowstone National Park. (Fig. 54)]\r\n\r\nWithin Yellowstone National Park, the quake caused only slight damage to\r\nbuildings at Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and a few other places.\r\nSmall landslides also occurred in various places, for example, at Tuff\r\nCliff near Madison Junction. The earthquake affected many thermal\r\nfeatures, particularly those in the main geyser basins near the west\r\nside of the Park. In several places the intensity of the thermal\r\nactivity increased markedly, in fewer places the activity decreased.\r\nSome geysers, long dormant, erupted immediately after the earthquake;\r\nothers erupted with much greater force and frequency than usual; still\r\nothers became dormant and have remained so. A general, widespread effect\r\nwas a noticeable increase in the muddiness of many pools and springs, as\r\nif the quake had produced a giant surge of water coursing through the\r\nunderground channels of the geyser basins. Of immediate concern to\r\neveryone, of course, was the earthquake’s effect on Old Faithful.\r\nFortunately, the only measurable effect was a slight lengthening of time\r\nbetween eruptions. After several months the time interval stabilized at\r\nabout 65 minutes.\r\n\r\nDetailed scientific studies bearing on the Hebgen Lake Earthquake in the\r\nweeks that followed showed that it was felt over more than 600,000\r\nsquare miles of the Western United States, and that it was the strongest\r\nshock ever recorded in this part of the Rocky Mountains. In 12 years’\r\ntime many traces of the quake have disappeared, but its frightful\r\naspects will not soon be forgotten. It serves as a vivid reminder, once\r\nagain, of the great restlessness that through the ages has been, and\r\ncontinues to be, the very special trademark of the Yellowstone country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _The Park and Man_\r\n\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago another powerful force entered the Yellowstone\r\nscene. Man, arriving in ever increasing numbers, came armed with the\r\npower to choose between preserving or destroying the wonders that nature\r\nhas taken more than 2.5 billion years to create. Sensing this grave\r\nresponsibility, he took the necessary steps to insure that these\r\nirreplaceable natural features would be preserved and protected. Today,\r\nYellowstone National Park indeed exists “for the benefit and enjoyment\r\nof the people,” a fitting and lasting symbol of a great national\r\nheritage that now includes more than 275 places of natural and\r\nhistorical interest. On the eve of the 100th anniversary of our first\r\nNational Park, we are again reminded of that continuing responsibility\r\nwe all share in preserving these unique places for the benefit and\r\nenjoyment of all future generations of visitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Acknowledgments_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject matter of this bulletin is based chiefly on the results of a\r\nsystematic program of geological investigations in Yellowstone National\r\nPark, conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey during the years 1965-71.\r\nThe program, ably organized and directed by A. B. Campbell, required the\r\nspecial skills and knowledge of many individuals to make a comprehensive\r\nstudy of all the varied and complex features of the Park area. Without\r\ntheir invaluable cooperation, assistance, and interest, this endeavor to\r\nsummarize the geologic story of Yellowstone would not have been\r\npossible. I therefore express my sincere thanks to the colleagues listed\r\nbelow, all of whom furnished unpublished information bearing on\r\ndifferent aspects of that story: R. L. Christiansen and H. R. Blank, Jr.\r\n(Quaternary volcanism); H. W. Smedes and H. J. Prostka (Absaroka\r\nvolcanism); D. E. White, L. J. P. Muffler, R. O. Fournier, and A. H.\r\nTruesdell (thermal activity); G. M. Richmond, K. L. Pierce, and H. A.\r\nWaldrop (glaciation); E. T. Ruppel and J. D. Love (sedimentary rocks and\r\ngeologic structure); J. D. Obradovich and Meyer Rubin (radiometric\r\ndating). W. L. Newman provided many helpful suggestions regarding the\r\npreparation of the manuscript.\r\n\r\nThe geological studies in Yellowstone received the full support and\r\ncooperation of former Park Superintendent J. S. McLaughlin,\r\nSuperintendent J. K. Anderson, and other personnel of the U.S. National\r\nPark Service. In particular, the helpful advice, interest, and\r\nenthusiasm of the entire Park Naturalist staff, especially J. M. Good\r\nand W. W. Dunmire, former and present Chief Park Naturalists,\r\nrespectively, greatly facilitated the work in all phases of the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]The specific area about which the early-day Indians first used the\r\n    term that is now translated as “Yellowstone” is unknown. The name\r\n    may have referred to the yellowish rocks that line the banks of the\r\n    Yellowstone River near its confluence with the Missouri River in\r\n    eastern Montana and western North Dakota. However, in the opinion of\r\n    H. M. Chittenden, who studied the question in considerable detail,\r\n    there is little doubt that the name was taken from the striking\r\n    yellow-hued walls of the gorge now known as the Grand Canyon of the\r\n    Yellowstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _Selected Additional Reading_\r\n\r\n\r\nAllen, E.
