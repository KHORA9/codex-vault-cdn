A B C BUTTER MAKING is the result of my own experience in\r\nthe dairy, together with an extended and careful observation of the\r\nexperiences and practices of some of the most successful butter-makers\r\nin the country, and is an answer, in a complete form, to the numberless\r\nquestions asked me (as Editor of the DAIRY WORLD), by beginners in the\r\ndairy.\r\n\r\n                                                    THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we can make butter we must have milk, and a few suggestions on\r\nthis important question will not be out of place here. In order that\r\nno dirt or hairs may find their way into the milk-pail, a careful\r\ndairyman will always brush off the teats and udder of his cow before he\r\nbegins to milk, yet, I am sorry to say, thousands of men who profess\r\nto be careful dairymen do not know this, and are sometimes guilty\r\nof that most uncleanly habit of softening up the teats by squeezing\r\nout a little milk on their hands. A large number of cows are utterly\r\nruined every year by improper milking; irregular milking spoils a large\r\nnumber; noisy, loud talking and rough milkers help to spoil a good many\r\nmore. The very slow milker, as well as the quick, jerky milker, who\r\nnever strips the cow thoroughly, are helping to make a large number\r\nof our cows unprofitable. Six o'clock in the morning and six o'clock\r\nin the evening are by far the best hours to do the milking. Some of\r\nour deep milkers should be milked three times a day for a week or more\r\nafter calving. I might write a chapter on kicking cows, but after a\r\nwide and exceedingly costly experience in this line will simply say I\r\ndo not believe in them, and would not accept the best one I ever saw as\r\na gift. I am satisfied that it is not a good plan to feed or \"slop\" a\r\ncow during the milking, as a hungry animal will be too deeply absorbed\r\nin eating to \"give down\" all the milk. Better feed just before or\r\nimmediately after milking. Keep strangers away from the stable during\r\nthe milking hour; never carry on a conversation in a loud voice with\r\nsome person in another part of the stable while milking; in short, do\r\nnothing that will be likely to draw the attention of your cow, or she\r\nwill in a greater or less degree \"hold up\" a part of the milk. When\r\npossible a cow should always be milked by the same person, as the\r\nmilker soon learns any little peculiarity of the animal, and knows\r\nexactly how to handle her, as well as readily detecting any unusual\r\noccurrence, such as shortage of milk, sore or caked teats, etc. Milk as\r\nrapidly as possible, without jerking, and avoid hurting the teats with\r\nsharp and long finger nails by keeping them well pared. Never attempt\r\nto draw the milk from a very sore or inflamed teat with your hands;\r\nit only causes the animal great pain, and in nine cases out of ten you\r\nwill fail to secure all of the milk. Milking tubes, made of silver,\r\nare not only great conveniences, but now that they can be bought so\r\ncheaply, are an absolute necessity, and all farmers should keep a few\r\non hand for use in case of an emergency. The silver tubes are the best,\r\nand can be purchased for half a dollar each of almost any dealer in\r\ndairy goods. I have mailed thousands of them during the past few years\r\nto dairymen in all parts of the country, and have received hundreds of\r\nletters stating that valuable cows have been saved that would otherwise\r\nhave been ruined for milking, but for the use of these tubes. It might\r\nbe well to say right here that in no case would I recommend the use of\r\ntubes for regular milking, as their constant use would soon distend the\r\norifice of the teat, so that it would leak. Grease or wet the tubes\r\nbefore inserting, and be careful to push in slowly. If the teat is\r\nvery sore the tubes may be allowed to remain in the teat for a day or\r\ntwo, but I would advise that they be removed after each milking when\r\npossible, and always wiped perfectly dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA good milking stool not only adds comfort to the milker, but helps\r\nto facilitate the work to a greater degree than one would naturally\r\nsuppose. I give an illustration of a handy stool, and as a novice can\r\neasily make one, I will simply say, make the leg according to the\r\nlength of your own. Before closing this chapter on milking I want to\r\nsay a word about the pail. Never use a wooden pail or vessel to milk\r\nin. The best pail I ever used was a patent device called the \"Michigan\r\nMilk Bucket,\" and were it not for the expense (I believe the price is\r\ntwo dollars), they would soon come into general use. The illustration\r\nshows exactly what they are--a combined pail, strainer and stool; and\r\nas the strainer prevents any dirt or hairs from getting into the pail,\r\nand the close-fitting cover precludes any possibility of the milk\r\nabsorbing stable odors, I cannot say too much in their praise. When\r\nthese pails were first placed on the market the strainer was at the\r\nbottom of the receiving cup, and all the dirt was washed into the pail,\r\nbut the manufacturers altered them by placing the strainer an inch\r\nabove the bottom of the receiver, and I believe that they are now as\r\nnear perfect a milk-pail as one could ask for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARE OF MILK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to enter into the chemistry of the milk. It would\r\nbe out of place in this A B C treatise. One peculiar thing I wish to\r\ndraw your attention to is the \"animal heat.\" When the milk first comes\r\nfrom the cow you cannot help noticing that it has a sort of feverish\r\nsmell, which soon passes off after exposure to the air. This \"cowey\"\r\nsmell should, of course, be allowed to pass off, but not in the stable,\r\nwhere the milk would be likely to take on a worse and more lasting odor.\r\n\r\nMilk is a great absorbent, and quickly takes on any and all odors which\r\nit comes in contact with, and when once taken on, they can never be got\r\nrid of. Therefore, the moment we are through milking a cow, we should\r\neither take the milk out of the stable and into another room, or pour\r\nit at once into a can or some vessel with a tight-fitting cover, that\r\nit may not absorb stable odors before we are through with the milking\r\nof all the cows. I think the best plan is to strain the milk at once\r\ninto an ordinary deep setting can and put the cover on tight. Remove\r\nthe can, as soon as it is filled, to the milk-room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANEY CAN, BACK VIEW.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HANEY CAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERSEY CAN.]\r\n\r\nNow comes the cooling of the milk. To make good butter we must cool\r\nour milk rapidly. The sooner we cool it down to 47 degrees after it\r\nleaves the cow the better the butter will be. The old-fashioned way of\r\nsetting the milk in shallow pans or crocks in the milk cupboard, which\r\nin summer was placed in the cellar and in the pantry in winter, is\r\nstill kept up by a good many farmers, and this no doubt accounts for\r\nthe steady production of ten-cent store butter with which our markets\r\nare always overstocked. If you expect to make good butter never set\r\nthe milk in the pantry or cellar, as the odors which it will absorb\r\nthere are just as numerous, if not quite so bad, as those in the cow\r\nstable. There is but one way, and dairymen are pretty generally agreed\r\nupon it, and that is to set the milk in deep cans in cold water, and\r\nthe colder the water the quicker the separation of the cream from the\r\nmilk. If you cannot afford to buy the patent deep setting cans like the\r\nCooley, the Haney, the Jersey, or the Wilhelm, by all means get the\r\ncommon deep setting \"shot-gun\" can, with or without the glass gauges in\r\nthe sides. The purpose of all these cans is to cool the milk rapidly,\r\nand though the manufacturers of this or that can may claim that their\r\ncan does the work more quickly than the others, I am of opinion that\r\nthey are all good, and one as good as the rest. If you have a spring,\r\nand can set the cans in the ground, where the water can flow all around\r\nand over the cans, you will be fortunate indeed. If you have no spring,\r\nand cannot afford a creamer, make a tank a little deeper than the cans,\r\nand keep the water flowing around the cans. The colder the water the\r\nbetter. If the water from your well is not colder than 47 degrees you\r\nshould use ice. By using ice or very cold spring or well water you get\r\nall, or nearly all, the cream to rise in from twelve to twenty hours,\r\nand as I said before, and I want to firmly impress it upon your minds,\r\nthe quicker you get the cream to rise the better butter you can make.\r\nNever allow the milk to set more than thirty hours, as it becomes acid\r\nor too thick, and loses much in flavor. I would much prefer to skim\r\nsooner, if I lost some of the cream by so doing, as I would more than\r\nmake up what I lost in quantity by the improved quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SHOT-GUN\" CAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOLEY CAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILK-ROOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be well to say a word about the milk-room before passing on to\r\nthe management of cream. It is absolutely necessary that we have a good\r\nmilk-room in which to not only set the milk, but to ripen the cream, do\r\nthe churning, and work the butter.\r\n\r\nHave the milk-room well ventilated, and build it so that you can\r\ncontrol the temperature at the proper point all the year 'round. A good\r\nairy place, with plenty of elbow-room is essential. I see too many\r\nsmall, \"stuffy\" crowded rooms, where there is scarcely a place for half\r\nthe utensils. Now, see that the air in your room is always pure, and do\r\nnot pollute it by going directly into it from the cow stable, with all\r\nthe odors clinging to your clothes and manure on your boots. Also have\r\nthe room situated as far from the barnyard and hog-pen as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF CREAM.\r\n\r\nSkim the milk before the cream becomes too thick and tough on top. I\r\nnever allow the cream to remain on the milk a moment after I think\r\nit is all up or separated from the milk. If you use the deep setting\r\ncans you will find the little conical skimmer, with ten or twelve inch\r\nhandle, the easiest to skim with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf you put the cream in a can, or other vessel containing cream\r\nthat was skimmed some hours previous, be sure to stir it all well\r\ntogether, so that it may be of the same consistency. Keep the cream\r\nat a temperature of 62 to 68 degrees until it becomes slightly sour,\r\nwhen it is ready for churning. I have churned very sweet cream and\r\nvery sour cream, but have never been able to get butter of good flavor\r\nfrom anything but slightly soured cream. I am also of the opinion that\r\nbutter made from cream only slightly sour will keep much longer than\r\nwhen made from a very sweet or sour cream. I am often asked if I think\r\nthat straining the cream is an advantage, and I will answer by saying\r\nthat I do think it aids somewhat in helping the butter to come more\r\nevenly. In the winter it may be found necessary to place the cream\r\nnear the stove, where it can be gradually warmed up to 68 or even 70\r\ndegrees, in order to have it sufficiently sour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTER COLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCH OF ANNATO TREE, SHOWING BLOSSOMS AND SEED PODS.]\r\n\r\nWe all prefer to have our butter of a rich orange color. White butter\r\nlooks too much like lard. Then, too, butter of a pale white hue never\r\nsells for as much in the market as the rich colored article. Years ago\r\npeople colored butter with the juice of carrots; later on the seeds\r\nof the Annato plant were crushed and the juice mixed with potash and\r\nwater. We now have many specially prepared compounds in the market,\r\nput up in liquid form and ready for immediate use. Almost all of these\r\ncommercial colors are good, but should be used sparingly. Nearly all\r\nthe beginners use too much the first time. There is no general rule to\r\nfollow in using color, and you will only be able to tell how much to\r\nuse by practice, as the butter of some cows is naturally of a richer\r\ncolor than others; this is especially true of the Jersey cows, the\r\nbutter from which needs but little artificial coloring. Always put the\r\ncoloring into the cream before beginning to churn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHURNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RECTANGULAR CHURN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENDULUM CHURN.]\r\n\r\nFew persons know how to churn properly. No matter how rich or nice the\r\ncream, if the churning is not done at a proper temperature and in a\r\nproper manner you cannot make good butter. Avoid the \"lightning\" patent\r\nchurn, which the agent will claim to bring butter in five minutes.\r\nCream that is churned too quickly always makes butter of a cheesey\r\nflavor, and quick to get rancid. Churning should never be done in less\r\nthan twenty minutes, and, if possible, not longer than forty minutes.\r\nGenerally the proper temperature at which to have the cream before\r\nbeginning to churn is 60 degrees, but sometimes this must be varied\r\na few degrees, according to circumstances. In winter we find 65 or\r\n68 degrees will be necessary in order to have the butter come within\r\nforty minutes. When cows are fresh the butter comes much more quickly\r\nthan it will after they have been fresh for a long period. Always\r\nstart the churn with a slow movement, gradually increasing until you\r\nhave reached the proper speed, which is 40 to 50 strokes per minute.\r\nI do not believe in the churn with a dash inside, nor do I believe\r\nin keeping the churn in motion a moment after the cream breaks. All\r\nsensible dairymen are trying to keep pace with the times, and have\r\nadopted the granular plan. This idea of scooping out great lumps of\r\nbutter from a churn, and trying to squeeze and rub out the buttermilk\r\nwith its caseous and albuminous matters is a thing of the past. Squeeze\r\nand press and knead all you please, and nothing but the water of the\r\nbuttermilk will come out; the very impurities which you desire to get\r\nout of the butter will be all the more firmly incorporated in it. Not\r\none butter-maker in ten (no, nor fifty) knows enough to stop the churn\r\nat the proper time, when the butter has formed into little pellets the\r\nsize of a wheat kernel. When those little pellets have formed, pull\r\nout the plug or stopper in the bottom of your churn; if you have not\r\ngot such a thing as a hole in your churn, don't waste a moment until\r\nyou have bored one there, at least an inch in diameter, and place a\r\nsmall piece of very fine wire sieve on the inside of the churn over the\r\nhole, and thereafter be careful not to have your plug so long that it\r\nwill punch the sieve off every time you put it in. Let the buttermilk\r\ndrain off through this hole, after first pouring in a little cold water\r\nand cooling the contents of churn down to a point where the globules\r\nor kernels of butter will stick together when you agitate the churn.\r\nNow let the churn stand and rest a few minutes, then pour in more cold\r\nwater, and let it drain off through the hole again, and if the water\r\ncomes out as clear as it went in, stop pouring, shake the churn a\r\nlittle, then make a good strong brine of well powdered salt that has\r\nbeen first sifted thoroughly, cork up the hole and pour in your brine,\r\nand let it stand on the butter for fifteen or twenty minutes, after\r\nwhich draw off as you did the water. You now have your butter in the\r\nbest possible condition for working. When you purchase your churn be\r\nsure and get one large enough; it is much better to have it too large\r\nthan not large enough. If you think you have not sufficient cream for\r\na churning and the cream is ripe, do not wait for another skimming,\r\nbut add sufficient milk to have the churn filled to about one-fourth\r\nits capacity. Do not use milk that is very sour, as it is likely to\r\ncontain so much casein that your butter will not be of good flavor.\r\nMany dairymen churn all the milk with the cream, but as it only adds\r\nmore work to the churning, I do not recommend it except in cases where\r\nthere is not cream enough to properly fill the churn. Illustrations are\r\ngiven of the best churns for the dairy, viz., the Barrel Churn, the\r\nRectangular Churn, and the Pendulum Churn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOWL OF GRANULAR BUTTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARREL CHURN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING THE BUTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME-MADE DANISH BUTTER WORKER.]\r\n\r\nNever work the butter when it is too warm. I find that 56 degrees is\r\nabout right. The main point in working butter is to get the buttermilk\r\nall out, and also to get it in good solid compact form. More depends\r\nupon proper working than one would naturally suppose. You often see\r\nbutter with great drops of buttermilk standing all over it; such butter\r\nwas only half worked, and will generally contain thirty to forty per\r\ncent. of water, and will keep sweet but a very short time. The other\r\nextreme is overworking, and this produces a dry crumbly mass, with no\r\nflavor. If the churning is done as described in the foregoing chapter\r\nvery little working is necessary, as the buttermilk is very nearly\r\nall out of the butter before it leaves the churn. Take the butter out\r\nof the churn with your butter spade, and heap it up on the worker.\r\nIf too warm for working at once, throw a cloth wet in cold water over\r\nit, and leave to drain and cool for thirty minutes. Before using the\r\nlever of your worker always dip it in cold water. Now take the lever\r\nand gently press the butter out over the full surface of the worker,\r\nand sprinkle on some salt; begin at the sides, and roll the butter back\r\ninto the centre, being careful not to do any rubbing or you will have\r\ngreasy butter. Now press out the whole mass again, and give it another\r\nsalting, and repeat the working two or three times until you have\r\nincorporated the salt throughout the whole mass evenly. The general\r\nrule for salting is to use one ounce of salt to a pound of butter, but\r\nas some people like \"salty\" butter and some \"fresh\" butter, you must\r\nsalt according to the wants of your patrons. I always use a fine sieve,\r\nand sift the salt over the butter on the worker, just as the baker\r\nsifts his flour over the dough when making it. Much depends upon the\r\nquality of the salt used in butter-making, and if you desire to make\r\ngood butter use only good salt, which is put up in sacks, and branded\r\n\"Dairy Salt,\" by nearly all the large salt makers in the country. If\r\nyou have a large dairy do not trust to guesswork, but buy a scale and\r\nuse it. An illustration of a scale which is made especially for salting\r\nbutter is given above. These scales weigh from one-half ounce up to\r\n250 pounds, and as they can be used for ordinary weighing without\r\nregard to the butter-salting attachment, every dairyman should have\r\none. They cost about six dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUREKA BUTTER WORKER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATERS' PATENT BUTTER WORKER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTIS FAVORITE BUTTER WORKER, FOR ONE OR TWO COWS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTTER-SALTING SCALE.]\r\n\r\nAn illustration of a home-made butter worker, which is used largely by\r\nthe Danes, is herewith given. Any man that is handy with tools, can\r\nmake one. Cuts of three other good workers are shown; they are well\r\nmade, and cost but a small amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING BUTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Butter well made is half sold,\" says an old maxim; but one would\r\nnaturally suppose that it was \"quite sold,\" to observe the careless\r\nmanner in which four-fifths of the farmers market their butter. Who has\r\nnot observed the tactics of the country storekeeper in buying butter?\r\nHere comes Mrs. Smith, or Jones, who is known near and far as a good\r\nbutter maker. See how anxious the merchant is to please her; he knows\r\nthat her butter is in great demand and will be sold at a good price\r\nbefore night. He pays her the highest market price, and while weighing\r\nthe neat prints of golden butter, carefully wrapped in spotless cloth\r\nor snow-white parchment paper, tells her that he wishes she could have\r\nbrought in more. It's a pleasure to have the trade of such a woman. But\r\nnow comes Mrs. Easy. Observe the cloudy expression on the merchant's\r\ncountenance, as he tells her that he's overstocked with butter; that\r\nthe market is \"way down.\" You will notice that he charges her a \"long\r\nprice\" for whatever he sells her, and dumps her butter, which is\r\ngenerally in mussy rolls, into the nearest shoe box. And who can blame\r\nhim, knowing that he cannot sell Mrs. Easy's butter at home, but must\r\nship it to the nearest market and sell it for \"low grade dairy\" at a\r\nprice which seldom, if ever, nets him a profit.\r\n\r\nOne seldom hears of the markets being overstocked with \"gilt edge\"\r\nbutter; on the other hand, the market is nearly always loaded down with\r\n\"low grades\" and grease.\r\n\r\nThe best plan for marketing butter is to endeavor to find customers\r\nat home, and sell as soon as possible. People that pack their butter\r\nand wait for a rise, are sometimes disappointed, and no butter can be\r\nas good four or six months after it is made as when fresh. It is far\r\nbetter, as a rule, to sell as soon as possible, at the best price you\r\ncan get, than to wait for a rise that sometimes fails to come.\r\n\r\nI receive many letters during the year from people asking me to find\r\nthem city customers. Such customers, as a rule, are very exacting;\r\nthey expect much, and paying a high price, have a perfect right to do\r\nso. These private customers (unless acquainted with the butter maker)\r\nseldom prove agreeable people to deal with. It is better to sell for a\r\nfew cents less at home, and leave no chance for dissatisfaction, or if\r\nyou cannot possibly sell all you make at home, better ship it to some\r\nreliable commission merchant, and leave him to fight out the battle\r\nwith the customers. A good plan is to make up a sample pail or tub,\r\nand ship to the commission merchant with a request that he \"judge\" and\r\nreport on it, with any suggestions he has to offer. Such a request will\r\nbe sure to bring you a prompt report from any good dealer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING AND SHIPPING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE ASH BUTTER TUB]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NINE POUND BALE BOXES.]\r\n\r\nThe size, shape and style of package for butter makers to use, must\r\ndepend largely upon the demands of the market to which the butter is\r\nshipped. A few years ago large quantities of roll butter were marketed\r\nin Chicago during the colder months; now you may travel from one end of\r\nthe market to the other and not see a hundred rolls. It is but a short\r\ntime ago that earthen crocks and jars were extensively used; now you\r\nscarcely ever see them. The cause for this is, that earthen vessels, of\r\nany kind, are not only liable to break, but are also more difficult to\r\nhandle in large quantities, and weigh much more than wooden packages.\r\nThe great bulk of butter that comes to Chicago now, is packed in\r\nwhite ash tubs and bale boxes. Occasionally we see a tin package with\r\nwood veneer, but they have never come into general use for the reason\r\nthat the acid gets under the tin and causes rust. Wooden packages are\r\njust now most popular, and as the manufacturers have reduced the cost\r\nof manufacturing them to a point where earthenware and tin cannot\r\ncompete in price, we may look to see them in use for years to come.\r\nThe ordinary white ash tubs can be had of every dairy supply dealer\r\nand nearly all of the general stores; they may be had in 20 lb., 25\r\nlb., 30 lb., 40 lb. and 60 lb. sizes. An illustration of the nine-pound\r\nbale boxes in crate is also given. During the last two years these bale\r\nboxes have become very popular. They can be shipped in crates of six\r\nand are convenient to handle; they can be had for about twelve cents\r\napiece.\r\n\r\nIn packing butter in wooden vessels we must guard against \"woody\r\ntaste,\" and there is but one way to do this, that is, to soak the\r\npackages from 24 to 48 hours in strong brine and then thoroughly scald\r\nthem out. Even this method sometimes fails to accomplish the work.\r\nA capital way to prevent woody taste, is to line the package with\r\nparchment paper, which not only prevents the butter from taking on a\r\nwoody flavor, but also prevents soakage and excludes the air. This\r\nparchment paper may now be had of all dairy implement dealers, in\r\nsheets and circles of any size. It costs about thirty cents a pound,\r\nand a pound is sufficient to pack several hundred pounds of butter.\r\n\r\nThere is still quite a trade in print butter, and when nicely packed\r\nin one or two-pound prints and of good quality it sells quickly, on\r\naccount of its convenient shape for family use. For print butter there\r\nhas been invented a machine which stamps out one-half and one-pound\r\nblocks very quickly and quite artistically. When butter is shipped in\r\nthis form it should be first carefully wrapped in cloth or parchment\r\npaper and packed in boxes in crates. Each box should contain but one\r\nblock of butter, as piling one block upon another would be likely to\r\npress out the delicate figures moulded or stamped on the block. The\r\nblocks for these patent printing machines are sometimes artistically\r\ncarved, so that the blocks of butter show sheaves of wheat, acorns,\r\netc., and sometimes with the maker's initials or monogram. For home\r\nuse the old fashioned round mould holding from a quarter of a pound to\r\ntwo pounds is still extensively used, and when properly soaked in cold\r\nwater before moulding, makes a very nice print of butter. These patent\r\nprinters and moulds save much time and are a great convenience over the\r\nold way of forming the butter into rolls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I X L BUTTER PRINTER.]\r\n\r\nIn packing it is always better to pack each churning in a separate tub\r\nor box, as the tub that contains different churnings will not be of\r\nuniform solidity or color throughout, and will therefore not sell for\r\nas much as a tub perfectly uniform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE POUND BUTTER MOULD.]\r\n\r\nRemember to soak the covers of the packages, and before fastening them\r\non sprinkle salt to a depth of a quarter of an inch over the top of\r\nthe butter cloth or paper. Never leave the cover off the packages for\r\nany length of time, for the reason that it will not only cause the top\r\nof the butter to become discolored, but it will also admit the air and\r\nspoil the top of the butter for several inches.\r\n\r\nThe moment you have packed your butter get it into a cool place--the\r\ncooler the better--and thereafter keep it as cool as possible, until\r\nyou have disposed of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERMOMETERS IN THE DAIRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrederic Sumner says \"There is no more use in trying to run a dairy\r\nwithout a good tested thermometer than there would be to attempt\r\nsailing a vessel without a rudder,\" and I heartily agree with him. A\r\ngood thermometer can be purchased for from fifty cents to a dollar,\r\nand at these prices is certainly within the reach of every dairyman.\r\nToo much depends upon the temperature of the water in which we cool\r\nour milk, the room we ripen our cream in, do our churning in, and the\r\ntemperature of the milk, cream, and the butter itself, to attempt\r\nany guess work. Our grandmothers used thumb and finger to ascertain\r\nthe temperature of milk and cream, but in these days of fifty cents,\r\nseventy-five cents, and a dollar a pound butter we find \"thumb-rule\"\r\nwill not work. An illustration of a thermometer made expressly for\r\ndairy use, is given; they are made of glass and float upright in the\r\nmilk or cream. The churning and cheese points are marked for the\r\nconvenience of new beginners; they retail at about fifty cents, and can\r\nbe purchased from any dealer in dairy goods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMS\r\n\r\nFor A B C Butter Makers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTest your cows.\r\n\r\nNever fill the churn over half full.\r\n\r\nNever touch the butter with your hands.\r\n\r\nCream rises best in a falling temperature.\r\n\r\nNever churn fresh unripened cream with ripened cream.\r\n\r\nAfter cream becomes sour, the more ripening the more it depreciates.\r\n\r\nThe best time for churning is just before the acidity becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nNever let your butter get warm; when once warmed through it will lose\r\nits flavor.\r\n\r\nExcessive working makes crumbly butter, spoils the grain and injures\r\nthe flavor.\r\n\r\nNever mix night's with morning's milk, as the warmth of the new and the\r\ncoldness of the old, hastens change and decomposition.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of disagreeable odors are easily absorbed by salt. Keep it,\r\ntherefore, in a clean, dry place, in linen sacks, if it is to be used\r\nfor butter making.\r\n\r\nThe best butter has the least competition to contend against, while the\r\nworst dairy products have the most. The better anything is, the more\r\nrare is it and the greater its value.\r\n\r\nA butter maker that uses his fingers instead of a thermometer, to find\r\nout the temperature of milk or cream will never make a success.\r\n\r\nCleanliness should be the Alpha and Omega of butter making. Absolute\r\ncleanliness as regards person, stable, utensils and package.\r\n\r\nFaults--The quickest way to find out the faulty points in your butter,\r\nis to send a sample of it to some reliable butter buyer and ask him to\r\nscore it.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the dairyman who makes $50.00 a year, per cow,\r\nand one who makes $30.00, is that the first works intelligently, the\r\nsecond mechanically.\r\n\r\nDetails--The price of success in butter making, as in all other classes\r\nof business, is strict attention to the little details; it's the sum of\r\nall these little things that determines whether your butter is to be\r\nsold for ten cents a pound or as a high priced luxury.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages of the system of setting milk in shallow pans or\r\ncrocks, for raising cream, are that a long period elapses before the\r\nskimming is completed, too much space is required, and in Summer the\r\nmilk becomes sour before the whole of the cream is raised.\r\n\r\nLabor saving appliances are intended, as the name implies, to save\r\nlabor, but they do not render care, thought and diligence the less\r\nnecessary. To understand the principles that underlie the business of\r\nbutter making, is as imperative as to use the most improved utensils.\r\n\r\nBy keeping a strict account only, can you find out the extent of your\r\nsuccess or failure. If the balance is on the right side, you will know\r\nwhether and how much it can be increased; if it is on the wrong side,\r\nyou will be more strongly convinced of the necessity for improvement.\r\n\r\nIf you keep your cows in a healthy condition, milk regularly; set the\r\nmilk in air tight cans with good cold water (either ice or spring);\r\nskim every twenty-four hours; ripen the cream properly; churn in a\r\nbarrel churn or some other good churn on the same principle; wash the\r\nbutter well while still in the churn in granular state; you will never\r\nbe troubled with white specks in your butter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE GOOD BUTTER.\r\n\r\n--BY N. BIGALOW, STOWE, VERMONT.--\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have good cows to start with, and if _good butter_\r\nis the object sought I prefer good Jerseys. The next thing is good\r\nfeed. Grass that is fresh and tender is best of all. This does not last\r\nvery long up here in Vermont. My cows have a feed of green corn fodder,\r\nat night, and a small feed of grain, in the morning. I prefer to mix\r\ndifferent kinds of grain together. It must be all sound and good. Make\r\nthe cows comfortable and contented. Kind treatment is indispensable,\r\nand the more regularity in caring for them the better.\r\n\r\nWe try to keep the milk entirely clean. If it is necessary we wash the\r\ncows' bags, before milking. The milk is strained into large, open pans,\r\nand as soon as the animal heat is out of it, the pans are covered over\r\nwith thin cotton cloth. The covers are made by sewing the edges of\r\nthe cloth to some strips of basswood, about three-fourths of an inch\r\nsquare and a little longer than the pans. They cost but a trifle, and\r\nafter using them ten years we would hardly make butter without them.\r\nThe butter is not quite so yellow, at first, for raising the cream\r\nunder the covers, but will be after it has stood a few hours.\r\n\r\nWhen we first tried our large pans, we used to run water around them,\r\nbut the coolers have got to leaking, and we do not think it would pay\r\nto get new ones.\r\n\r\nOur rule is to skim the milk soon after it sours, as the cream will\r\ncome off easily. We keep the cream in a cellar, when it is necessary,\r\nbut prefer to keep it in the milk room, when it is not too warm. Our\r\ndairy is small, and we have churned only twice a week, this year. We\r\nuse the Stoddard churn, and would not use a float churn. I have never\r\nseen the acme churn yet, and hardly think it has been made. 58 degrees\r\nis the right temperature at which to churn the cream, in warm weather:\r\n62 in cold, and 60 in spring and fall. We put in from three to six\r\nquarts of water to thin the cream, and if the cream is too warm we use\r\ncold water (we have a cold spring), and in extreme warm weather use a\r\nlittle ice. If the cream is too cold we warm the water sometimes up\r\nto 120 degrees. If that will not answer, the cream must be warmed\r\nbeforehand. The buttermilk is drawn off as soon as it can be done, and\r\nleave most of the butter in the churn. Any butter that runs out is put\r\nback with a skimmer. We use cold water enough to keep the butter in the\r\ngrain, and wash it until the water runs clear. I suppose brine would\r\nbe better, but have not used it much. After the butter has drained,\r\nthe salt is strained in with a paddle; and then it is taken out with\r\nthe paddle and pressed into the butter bowl. We use about an ounce of\r\nsalt to a pound, but some of it works out. After it has stood a few\r\nhours, it is worked with a lever in an old fashioned butter worker,\r\njust enough to get the salt in evenly, and then it is ready to print.\r\nWe always try to injure the grain as little as possible.\r\n\r\nOur printer holds four pounds, and makes eight half pound prints.\r\nThe prints are put up in four pound boxes, and cut apart with wooden\r\nblades. The boxes are made here in Stowe, and are washed and scalded\r\nwith boiling water, sprinkled with salt.\r\n\r\nOur milk house is shaded on the eastern side by a willow tree, and on\r\nthe southern by another building, and we can cool it to some extent\r\nwith currents of air. But if we should admit currents of air, without\r\nthe covers over the pans, there would be white specks in the butter.\r\n\r\nWe use butter color when it is necessary to color the butter, but think\r\nit better to color it too little than too much.\r\n\r\nI am in the habit of mixing a small quantity of cotton seed meal with\r\nthe grain for the cows, and think I get a little more milk from that\r\nthan anything else. Linseed meal is very high here, and I have never\r\nused it.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, the cows must have pure air to breathe, and the\r\nmilk, cream and butter must be kept in a good atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI am fully convinced that any farmer that makes a prime article of\r\nbutter, of uniform quality, has an excellent opportunity to use common\r\nsense and sound judgment.\r\n\r\nConsumers of such butter, as I have described, need not have any\r\nfear that they are eating anything that is, or _ever was_, filthy or\r\nunwholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRYMAN'S LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Creaming Milk by Centrifugal Force              $  50\r\n\r\n  Hazard's Butter and Butter Making                  25\r\n\r\n  Curtis' Hints on Dairying                          50\r\n\r\n  Willard's Practical Dairy Husbandry              3 00\r\n\r\n  Willard's Practical Butter Book                  1 25\r\n\r\n  ABC Butter Making, by Burch                        30\r\n\r\n  Harris' Cheese and Butter Maker's Hand Book      1 50\r\n\r\n  The Jersey, Alderney and Guernsey Cow            1 75\r\n\r\n  Feeding Animals.
