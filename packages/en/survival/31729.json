WHAT IT IS.\r\n\r\nDEFINITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The fleshy pome or fruit of a rosaceous tree (_Pyrus malus_), the\r\norigin of which is probably the wild crab-apple of Europe, cultivated in\r\ninnumerable varieties in the temperate zones.=\r\n\r\n=It is scarcely known in the wild state, but as an escape from\r\ncultivation its fruit becomes small, acid, and harsh, and is known as\r\nthe crab; the cultivated crab-apple is the fruit of other species of\r\n_Pyrus_. Of the cultivated crabs there are the Siberian (_Pyrus\r\nprunifolia_), the Chinese (_Pyrus spectabillis_), and the Cherry-crab\r\n(_Pyrus baccata_), all natives of northern Asia.=\r\n\r\n=The apple was first introduced into America from England, in 1629, by\r\nthe governor of Massachusetts Bay.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS PERTAINING TO APPLE ORCHARDISTS.\r\n\r\nExtracts from General Statutes of Kansas, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING OR DESTROYING FRUIT- OR SHADE-TREES.\r\n\r\n(Vol. 2, p. 374.)

H. S. BAILEY,\r\nChemist at the Kansas State University.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cultivation of the apple tree, which, like most plants, gets its\r\nnourishment from two sources, the soil and the atmosphere, these must be\r\nfirst considered. From the soil come the mineral ingredients, those that\r\nare given back to the soil when the plant is burned, and from the\r\natmosphere come the ingredients of no less importance in the growth of\r\nthe tree, but which mostly disappear as invisible gases upon combustion.\r\nUpon the character of this soil, and upon the climate, a general term\r\nthat may be said to cover the conditions of the atmosphere, depend the\r\nsuccess of the horticulturist. In addition to this, insect pests are\r\nliable to constantly menace the crop.\r\n\r\nIn the making of soils, a process that is constantly going on, the most\r\nimportant agents are water, air, frost, sunshine, and the action of\r\nliving organisms. By this combined action, the mountain, with its rich\r\nstore of mineral matter, is disintegrated, its constituents are partly\r\ndissolved in the water and partly carried mechanically to the plains\r\nbelow; the air is distributed through the soil; seeds are dropped; the\r\nliving animal forms begin to multiply; the soil is enriched, and\r\ngradually it begins to be in a condition suitable to bear the simpler\r\nforms of vegetable life, which in turn decaying, add to the richness of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the mechanical condition of the soil has much to do with\r\nthe successful growth of the plant. If the soil is extremely fine, it is\r\nliable to become so compact that the rootlets cannot easily penetrate\r\nit, when it is of such a composition as to bake readily in the sun; if\r\nvery coarse, like gravel, there is not a sufficient capacity to retain\r\nmoisture. It should, however, be porous enough to allow the air to\r\npenetrate it, for upon the aeration of the soil depends much of its\r\nfertility. We loosen the soil about the roots of plants to allow the air\r\nto penetrate and give an opportunity for the chemical changes constantly\r\nundergoing in the soil. Then, too, the work of the earthworms in\r\nloosening the soil, and thus adding to its porosity, should not be\r\noverlooked. In this soil workshop, too, live and labor certain minute\r\norganisms that make it their business to enrich the soil by helping the\r\nrootlets to assimilate the nitrogen of the air.\r\n\r\nSince the soil is composed mostly of ingredients that come from the\r\ndecomposition of rocks, it follows that is must be of very complex\r\ncomposition. Fortunately, however, there are only a few of the\r\ningredients of the soil that are of interest to the agriculturist, as\r\nonly a few of the elements, as they are called, go to make up the plant\r\nstructure, or at least only a few are essential ingredients of the\r\nplant. Nitrogen, though very abundant in the air, is not abundant in the\r\nsoil. In fact, the soil has to depend largely on the nitrogen compounds\r\nthat are washed out of the atmosphere in small quantities by the rain.\r\nAnother source of nitrogen is the action of certain bacteria, that make\r\nlittle sacs on the rootlets and, living on the juices of the plants, fix\r\nthe nitrogen of the air, and thus fertilize the soil; especially on\r\nplants of the leguminous family, as peas, beans, and clover.\r\n\r\nSilicon, which with oxygen makes ordinary sand, is essential to the\r\ngrowth of plants and is everywhere found in abundance. Sulphur, united\r\nwith oxygen and the metals to form sulphates, is generally abundant\r\nenough. The same may be said of chlorine, which, united with sodium or\r\npotassium, is always present in our prairie soils. Phosphorus, as it\r\noccurs in the phosphates, is one of the most essential ingredients of a\r\nfertile soil. Calcium and magnesium are found in combination as\r\ncarbonates and sulphates, and, though essential, are usually abundant,\r\nespecially where limestone rocks underlie the soil and outcrop in so\r\nmany places. Potassium is found united with chlorine or sulphuric acid.\r\nIt is one of the elements that is most liable to be exhausted from the\r\nsoil by a succession of crops. Sodium exists almost everywhere. It is\r\none of the elements of common salt, and, though much like potassium,\r\ncannot take the place of the latter in plant nurture. Iron is abundant\r\nand at the same time necessary in small quantities. The elements above\r\nmentioned, together with oxygen, are to be found in the ashes of plants.\r\nBesides, there are two elements that come largely from the atmosphere,\r\nnamely carbon and hydrogen, which, united with oxygen, make up the bulk\r\nof the plant. Thus, wood is a substance containing carbon, hydrogen, and\r\noxygen, with small quantities of nitrogen and mineral salts. The mineral\r\nsalts represent about one per cent. of air-dried wood.\r\n\r\nHaving considered in a general way the constituents of the plant, and\r\nhaving noticed the source of each of these constituents, it may be of\r\ninterest to look at the composition of the soil as revealed by chemical\r\nanalysis. \"A\" is the analysis of a soil from Finney county, as made in\r\nthe laboratory of the Kansas State University, by the author. \"B\" is a\r\nsoil from Wyandotte county, as reported in the report of the Kansas\r\nState Board of Agriculture for 1874. \"C\" is a prairie soil from Dakota,\r\nas reported by Prof. E. Richards, of the department of agriculture.\r\n\r\n                                     \"A\"           \"B\"          \"C\"\r\n  Silica and insoluble              71.66         82.16        69.82\r\n  Iron and aluminum oxides           6.55          6.70        12.05\r\n  Calcium oxide                      4.41           .68          .85\r\n  Magnesium oxide                    1.02           .06          .87\r\n  Phosphoric anhydride                .18           .08          .11\r\n  Chlorine                            .01           .03          .03\r\n  Potassium oxide                     .75           .05          .72\r\n  Sodium oxide                        .25           .11          .94\r\n  Sulphuric anhydride                 .06           .39          .12\r\n  Volatile and organic matter        3.98          5.44         8.90\r\n  Moisture                           9.67          3.80         6.27\r\n  Undetermined, carbonic acid, etc.  1.48           .30          .22\r\n                                   ------        ------       ------\r\n                                   100.00        100.00       100.00\r\n\r\nIn some cases it happens that there is a sufficient quantity of an\r\ningredient in the soil, but it is not in a sufficiently _soluble_ form\r\nto be available. It will be noticed that in the analyses quoted above\r\nthe amount of the necessary constituents of the soil to plant growth is\r\nnot in any case large. The nitrogen may be present in the volatile and\r\norganic matter, and upon the proportion of this complex organic matter\r\nvery often depends to a great extent the fertility of the soil.\r\n\r\nSome experiments made at one of the agricultural experiment stations\r\nupon the effect of \"apple stock,\" that is, young trees raised for\r\nnursery purposes, on the soil, showed that in eleven tons of such stock\r\nthe following quantities of ingredients were removed from the soil:\r\n\r\n  Silica                 50.6 lbs.\r\n  Phosphoric acid        21.4  \"\r\n  Sulphuric acid         14.3  \"\r\n  Chlorine                1.3  \"\r\n  Carbonic-acid gas      94.9  \"\r\n  Iron oxide              6.1  \"\r\n  Lime                  138.6 lbs.\r\n  Magnesia               23.7  \"\r\n  Soda                   21.3  \"\r\n  Potash                 27.1  \"\r\n                       -----------\r\n  Total                 399.3 lbs.\r\n\r\nThis is no inconsiderable quantity of material to be removed by a single\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nProfessor Goessmann, in discussing the ash of fruits, gives the\r\nfollowing analysis of the ash of the Baldwin apple; this would represent\r\nthe mineral matter taken from the soil by the fruit: Potash, 63.54 per\r\ncent.; soda, 1.71; lime, 7.28; magnesia, 5.52, and phosphoric acid,\r\n20.87. Comparing this with the ash of other fruits, it is seen that the\r\namount of potash required is larger than in the case of other fruits\r\nexcept plums and peaches, and the amount of phosphoric acid is high, but\r\nnot as high as in the case of some berries. The application is obvious;\r\nin order to successfully raise apples there must be an abundance of\r\npotash and of phosphoric acid in the soil, and these ingredients must be\r\nin an available form.\r\n\r\nIf we compare the apple and the pear by an analysis for fertilizing\r\nconstituents, or such constituents as are usually introduced into\r\ndeficient soil by means of fertilizers, we have the following table:\r\n1000 parts of the fruit contain, in the case of each,\r\n\r\n          H2O   N  Ash  K2O Na2O  CaO  MgO P2O5  SO3 SiO2\r\n  Apple   831 0.6  2.2  0.8  0.6  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.1  0.1\r\n  Pear    831 0.6  3.3  1.8  0.3  0.3  0.2  0.5  0.2  0.1\r\n\r\nWhen we study the composition of the apple, to determine the \"proximate\r\nprinciples,\" as they are called, it is noticed that we have the\r\nconstituents mentioned in the discussion of the elements contained in\r\nthe fruit combined to form various substances; thus:\r\n\r\n                              Apples.  Pears. Cherries.  Peaches.\r\n  Water                         82.04   83.95     75.73     84.99\r\n  Sugar                          6.83    7.00     13.11      1.58\r\n  Free acid                       .85     .07       .35       .61\r\n  Albuminous substances           .45     .26       .90       .46\r\n  Pectous substances              .47    3.28      2.29      6.31\r\n  Soluble                       14.96   10.90     17.25      9.39\r\n\r\nFree acid in fruits is not neutralized by sugar, but it is well known\r\nthat an abundance of sugar will cover up the sour taste of a fruit. The\r\nconstituents above noted are mostly found in the expressed juice of the\r\nfruit, and give it its characteristic flavor. Without the sugar in these\r\njuices it would not be possible to make any alcoholic beverages from\r\nthem. In the process of fermentation, in the case of apple juice, we\r\nhave first the change of the sugar to alcohol and carbonic-acid gas,\r\nwhich imparts to cider its characteristic taste and tang. Afterwards,\r\nthe alcoholic solution, in the presence of the organic matter, is\r\nsubjected to what is called acetic fermentation; that is, the vinegar\r\nplant grows at the expense of the organic matter in the cider, and this\r\nbeverage is converted into vinegar, containing acetic acid. It is a\r\nfamiliar fact that the change does not readily take place except when\r\ncider is exposed to the air, and this is shown to be true from a\r\nchemical standpoint, as the cider really is oxidized to make the\r\nvinegar; that is, it takes up oxygen from the air.\r\n\r\nThe greater the proportion of sugar, the greater the quantity of\r\nalcohol, the stronger the vinegar will be. Grapes contain more than\r\ntwice as much sugar as apples; hence, a wine that is made from them is\r\nstronger in alcohol than a cider made from apples. Cherries, as will be\r\nseen by reference to the table above, contain a large amount of sugar;\r\nhence their use in making cherry brandy, which contains a large per\r\ncent. of alcohol. It should be said, however, that in order to make\r\nbrandy the cherry juice must be distilled. In this respect the process\r\nis similar to that employed in making apple brandy.\r\n\r\nAfter the juice has been extracted from the apples the pomace that\r\nremains is sometimes used as a fertilizer. This is valuable chiefly on\r\naccount of the mineral salts contained in it. An analysis of the pomace\r\nshows that it contains: Water, 69.90 per cent.; ash, .71; albuminous\r\nsubstances, 1.58; fiber, 4.87; nitrogen, free extract, 21.24; fat,\r\n1.71.\r\n\r\nThe acid of the apple is usually considered to be malic acid, but really\r\nthere are several acids mixed together. It is a mild and agreeable\r\nvegetable acid, and its presence adds much to the flavor of the fruit.\r\nThe pectous and albuminous substances are those that assist in the\r\nformation of fruit jellies. Some of these substances are liquid when\r\nhot, and gelatinize on cooling; by too long boiling they lose this\r\nproperty of gelatinizing; hence the precaution that is taken in the\r\nmaking of fruit jellies not to boil the juice too long.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the ripening of fruits like the apple has been\r\nextensively studied, as has also that of the subsequent decay. According\r\nto recent researches, early varieties of apples contain little starch\r\nwhen picked, and do not keep well. The season, soil, and age of the tree\r\naffect the composition of the fruit. It has been shown that sugar is\r\nsure to be formed from the starch in the process of ripening, after the\r\nfruit is taken from the tree, and during the winter the cane sugar is\r\ngradually, and finally almost entirely, changed to directly-reducing\r\nsugar. The maximum sugar content is reached earlier the earlier in the\r\nseason the apple ripens. Late winter varieties reach this point as late\r\nas November. There is much starch in the latter when picked, which\r\ngradually changes to sugar on keeping. This process is analogous to the\r\nripening of the banana. This fruit is picked while green, and from it is\r\nmade by the natives of South America a flour which is a good farinaceous\r\nfood, and readily answers the place of the starchy grains. We are\r\nfamiliar with the fact that as the fruit ripens it contains large\r\nquantities of sugar, and is edible uncooked, which fact is usually not\r\ntrue of starchy foods.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the decay of the apple has been discussed in a very\r\ninteresting way in the _Popular Science Monthly_ for May, 1893, by Byron\r\nD. Halsted. Though chemical changes take place here, also, and the apple\r\nis finally resolved mostly into carbonic-acid gas, water, and mineral\r\nsalts, yet these changes are brought about by the action of various\r\nfungi which find a soil favorable to their growth in the apple pulp.\r\n\r\nThough apples are considered digestible and wholesome, their\r\ndigestibility is much increased by cooking. This is especially true if\r\nsome of the starch is not converted to sugar, for, as noted above,\r\nstarch, to be readily assimilated in the system, should be cooked. There\r\nis probably no fruit that is so uniformly wholesome and so deservedly\r\npopular with all classes as the apple. The apple and pear were known in\r\nEngland before the conquest, and, indeed, probably before the Saxon\r\ninvasion. They have been gradually \"improved\" from the wild crab-apple\r\nof Europe. It is stated on good authority that there is no country on\r\nthe globe so well adapted to the growth of this fruit as the temperate\r\nregions of North America, and this seems to be demonstrated by the fact\r\nthat the apples of the United States are superseding the native fruit in\r\nmost of the civilized countries.\r\n\r\n  ANALYSES OF THE ASH OF THE APPLE.\r\n\r\n                         Sap-wood.

G. THOMPSON, of Edwardsville, Kan.\r\n\r\nOften the title of a book or essay gives little information as to what\r\nwill follow, and under \"The Apple Business\" there are a variety of\r\nsubjects, on any one of which an essay might be written. In this short\r\npaper I shall speak of our foreign markets. A Kansas apple in London is\r\na long way from home. But it is there, and not at all disconcerted by\r\nits strange surroundings. What is our apple doing there? Was it imported\r\nas a curiosity? Is it there as evidence of some venture or speculation?\r\nNeither; it has passed the experimental stage and is on a perfectly\r\nlegitimate errand. It has gone over for English gold and will send the\r\nsame back to its Kansas home. Now comes the interesting part, which\r\nmakes business of the transaction. If profitable, it means prosperity;\r\nand a wave of prosperity is what the whole country needs, and when the\r\nwave comes there will be a lot of folks who will want to make the\r\ninundation permanent. Apples, on arriving in London or Liverpool, are\r\nsold at auction on the docks, immediately on arrival, usually in\r\ntwenty-barrel lots. Of each lot two barrels are opened, one is poured\r\nout on a table, and one has the head removed so that the faced end may\r\nbe seen. This is called a \"show,\" and in the account of sales the\r\n\"shows\" are charged for at the rate of one shilling each.\r\n\r\n                     AMERICAN APPLES ABROAD.\r\n\r\n  European receivers of American apples, represented by Chas.\r\n              Forster, 76-78 Park Place, N.

This\r\ncatalogue gives the mark, brand or owner's name on barrel, the name of\r\nthe variety, condition of fruit, and whether tight or loose in the\r\nbarrel, the name of the vessel on which the fruit arrived, the point\r\nfrom which it was shipped, and the gross proceeds of the sales of these\r\n2451 barrels--1047 were from Canada and 1404 from the United States.\r\nLast year I sold for export 1000 barrels of apples. The buyer told me it\r\nwas very difficult to carry barreled apples across the water in good\r\ncondition. And that, owing to the peculiar motion of the ship, apples\r\nwhich were tight when loaded would be loose and bruised on arrival at\r\nLiverpool. You may judge of the correctness of this statement when I\r\ntell you that, in the account of sales of 153 barrels, 142 are reported\r\nas loose and 11 tight. They are not all that bad, for further on 212\r\nare reported as 171 tight and 41 loose. Apples when loose lose from $1\r\nto $1.75 in value; a lot of 12--8 Winesap and 4 York Imperial,\r\nloose--were sold for 15s. 3d. or $3.80 per barrel; 43 Winesaps, loose,\r\nbrought 14s. 9d. or $3.68. Newtown Pippins bring the highest price,\r\nranging from $5 to $9 per barrel.\r\n\r\nThe apples are mostly from Canada and New York, the varieties being\r\nprincipally Newtown Pippin, Baldwin, Greening, and [Northern] Spy; still\r\nI find in the list such familiar names as Ben Davis, Genet, and Winesap.\r\nOn inquiry, I find the freight from Kansas City to New York is 63-1/2\r\ncents, and from New York across the water, seventy-five cents per\r\nbarrel. A report of sales would read something like this: One barrel Ben\r\nDavis, $3.80; freight, $1.35; commission, 20 cents; net proceeds, $2.25.\r\nThis is supposing they should reach the other side loose. If, owing to\r\nsuperior skill in packing, they should reach their destination tight,\r\nthe net proceeds would be $3 or $3.25. The Liverpool quotation on\r\nwestern Ben Davis, December 11, is $4 to $5 for tight; $3.50 to $4.38\r\nfor loose. I speak of one firm only; many others are in the same line.\r\n\r\n  COMPARISON OF SEASONS, 1881 TO 1898.\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n          |                          Ports of Export.\r\n          |                     Figures represent barrels.\r\n          |---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Date.   |  New    |         | Mont-  | Port- |Halifax|Phil-|Bal- |Anna-\r\n          |  York.  | Boston. | real.  | land. |and St.|adel-|ti-  | pol-\r\n          |         |         |        |       |Johns. |phia.|more.| is.\r\n  --------+---------+---------+--------+-------+-------+-----+-----+------\r\n  1880-81 |  599,200|  510,300| 145,276| 39,908| 24,250|9,872|     |\r\n  1881-82 |   75,889|   65,093|  56,433|  6,497| 13,805|     |     |21,535\r\n  1882-83 |  169,570|  102,409|  64,390| 16,890| 18,542|3,900|     |19,893\r\n  1883-84 |   53,048|    7,145|   7,445|  9,811|  3,758|  325|     |\r\n  1884-85 |  256,314|  307,130|  84,487| 71,460| 41,207|     |     | 8,612\r\n  1885-86 |  466,203|  221,724|  68,716| 87,301| 37,982|  186|     | 3,161\r\n  1886-87 |  175,595|  303,479| 106,713|100,569| 94,606|     |     |26,965\r\n  1887-88 |  275,696|  163,916|  93,058| 25,215| 32,652|     |     |17,884\r\n  1888-89 |  474,337|  382,199| 291,307|145,825| 94,691|  860|     |18,190\r\n  1889-90 |  169,557|  132,589| 162,526|122,433| 53,627|     |     |37,030\r\n  1890-91 |   76,503|   23,123| 182,095| 80,365| 89,190|     |     |\r\n  1891-92 |  537,247|  339,964| 320,457|163,145| 87,379|  550|   72|\r\n  1892-93 |  218,037|  204,138| 429,243|235,395|116,725|     |     |\r\n  1893-94 |   29,396|    4,796|  56,255| 49,344| 35,058|     |     |\r\n  1894-95 |  221,398|  523,123| 273,353|155,878|264,410|     |     |\r\n  1895-96{|  230,705|   84,771| 128,027|141,955|165,797|     |     |\r\n         {|[A]13,610|         |[A]1,861|       |       |     |     |\r\n  1896-97 |  570,327|1,015,029| 700,274|221,350|409,733|3,133|     |\r\n  1897-98 |  361,894|  176,322| 163,313|126,261| 82,208|3,943|   55|\r\n\r\n  Additionally in 1891-92, 1,337 barrels were exported from Newport News,\r\n  and 215 from Norfolk.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                |                       Ports of Import.\r\n                |                 Figures represent barrels.\r\n     Date.      |------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                |Liverpool.| London. | Glasgow.|Hamburg.| Various.|   Total.\r\n  --------------+----------+---------+---------+--------+---------+----------\r\n  1880-81       |  839,444 | 177,936 | 216,391 |        |  95,036 | 1,328,806\r\n  1881-82       |  133,784 |  46,147 |  59,266 |        |      55 |   239,252\r\n  1882-83       |  253,432 |  46,975 |  81,269 |        |  13,318 |   395,594\r\n  1883-84       |   46,661 |   4,843 |  29,685 |        |     343 |    81,532\r\n  1884-85       |  491,898 | 123,081 | 137,631 |        |  16,590 |   769,210\r\n  1885-86       |  537,695 | 147,102 | 176,445 |        |  24,031 |   885,273\r\n  1886-87       |  468,553 | 187,840 | 138,756 |        |  12,775 |   807,924\r\n  1887-88       |  346,557 | 104,072 | 139,517 |        |  18,275 |   608,421\r\n  1888-89       |  790,502 | 279,374 | 272,068 |        |  64,465 | 1,407,409\r\n  1889-90       |  418,850 | 128,248 | 116,449 |        |  14,115 |   677,762\r\n  1890-91       |  252,548 | 116,705 |  80,772 |        |   1,260 |   451,285\r\n  1891-92       |  917,535 | 224,356 | 282,553 |        |  25,892 | 1,450,336\r\n  1892-93       |  798,291 | 174,405 | 220,790 |        |  10,052 | 1,203,538\r\n  1893-94       |  101,205 |  32,581 |  38,524 |        |   2,530 |   174,841\r\n  1894-95       |  853,198 | 388,535 | 173,312 |        |  23,110 | 1,438,155\r\n  1895-96      {|  410,596 | 196,184 | 127,942 |        |  16,533 |   751,255\r\n               {|[A]11,342 |[A]2,458 |[A]1,771 |        |         | [A]15,471\r\n  1896-97       |1,581,560 | 716,771 | 411,575 | 117,105|  92,835 | 2,919,846\r\n  1897-98       |  490,138 | 198,281 | 123,828 | 88,780|  12,969  |   913,996\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n  [A] Boxes.\r\n\r\nDuring the week ending December 11, 1897, there were exported from the\r\nUnited States to Europe 25,447 barrels of apples; of these, Liverpool\r\ngot 3335, London, 2580, Glasgow, 3567, Hamburg, 5264; equaling 14,756.\r\nThe total export to Europe this year from the United States, up to\r\nDecember 11, is 586,906 barrels bringing this country over 1-1/2 million\r\ndollars. Last year we had a much larger crop, and up to this date had\r\nexported 2,087,573 barrels. Owing to the liability of getting loose in\r\nthe barrel some shippers use boxes. We packed, last fall, 1000 boxes of\r\nWillow Twig and Ben Davis; these were packed in pear boxes, each apple\r\nwrapped in paper; the boxes (filled) would weigh about forty pounds. The\r\napples are placed in layers six long by four wide and four layers deep,\r\nninety-six apples to the box, putting the finest apples on top. The\r\ncovers are put on with a lever press that presses on the ends of the\r\nboards and springs both the bottom and top of the box; the extra size in\r\nthe middle is protected by cleats on the ends. The sides are of thicker\r\nboards and do not spring. If the apples should shrink in size, as apples\r\ndo, the spring in the box will take up the slack. In loading on the car\r\nor ship, the boxes are placed on their edges. One thousand boxes make a\r\ngood car-load, weighing about 40,000 pounds. A barrel will make about\r\n4-1/2 boxes. These cases of selected apples are expected to sell readily\r\nfor eight shillings (or $2) per box, and packed in this careful manner\r\nshould go through in perfect condition. If they bring satisfactory\r\nprices, I predict that next year more than one Kansas orchard will be\r\npacking apples for foreign export.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE WELLHOUSE ORCHARDS.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Mr. F. Wellhouse planted, at Glenwood, Leavenworth county,\r\nKansas, 117 acres of apple trees, as follows: 60 acres of Ben Davis, 32\r\nof Missouri Pippin, and 25 of Winesap. This orchard yielded, in 1880,\r\n1594 bushels of apples, which sold for $1.50 per barrel, or $797; and in\r\n1881 it yielded 3887 bushels, which sold for $4 per barrel, or $5184.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 he planted, near Gardner, Miami county, 160 acres, as follows:\r\n80 acres of Ben Davis, 40 of Missouri Pippin, 30 of Winesap, and 8 of\r\nCooper's Early and 8 of Maiden's Blush. These two orchards, of 277 acres\r\ncombined, yielded, in 1882, 12,037 bushels, which sold for $2.48 per\r\nbarrel, or $9,950.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he planted, at Fairmount, Leavenworth county, 160 acres, as\r\nfollows: 80 acres of Ben Davis, 40 of Jonathan, 30 of Winesap, and 8 of\r\nCooper's Early and 8 of Maiden's Blush.\r\n\r\nThese three orchards, of 437 acres combined, yielded as follows:\r\n\r\n  1883, 12,388 bushels, sold at $3.00 per barrel.\r\n  1884, 11,726    \"        \"     2.04    \"\r\n  1885, 15,373    \"        \"     2.00    \"\r\n  1886, 34,909    \"        \"     1.45    \"\r\n  1887, 33,790    \"        \"     2.11    \"\r\n  1888, 20,054    \"        \"     1.81    \"\r\n  1889, 11,952    \"        \"     2.49    \"\r\n  1890, 79,170    \"        \"     3.00    \"\r\n  1891, 63,698    \"        \"     1.75    \"\r\n  1892,    978 bushels.\r\n  1893,    900    \"\r\n  1894, 47,374    \"       sold at $2.50 per barrel.\r\n  1895, 59,138    \"\r\n  1896,    784    \"\r\n  1897,  3,758    \"\r\n  1898,  3,639    \"       not sold yet.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 he planted, near Wakarusa, Osage county, 800 acres, as follows:\r\n300 acres of Ben Davis, 200 of Missouri Pippin, 160 of Jonathan, 75 of\r\nYork Imperial, and 65 of Gano. In 1895 this orchard yielded 3470\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 he planted, near Tonganoxie, Leavenworth county, 300 acres, as\r\nfollows: 100 acres of Ben Davis, 100 of Gano, 33 of Jonathan, 33 of York\r\nImperial, and 34 of Missouri Pippin.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 he sold nearly 21,780 bushels, put in cold storage 9000 bushels,\r\nand sent to dryer 26,600 bushels, making a total for 1895 of 57,380\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 he set out, near Summit, Leavenworth county, 140 acres, making a\r\ntotal acreage of 620 acres of Ben Davis, 76 of Winesap, 409 of Missouri\r\nPippin, 190 of Jonathan, 150 of York Imperial, 160 of Gano, 16 of\r\nMaiden's Blush, and 16 of Cooper's Early.\r\n\r\nDuring this time he sold thousands of bushels of \"culls\" that are not\r\ncounted in this statement, excepting in 1895.

J. S. Downer, of Kentucky, writes\r\nthat old trees are there found from which suckers are taken in way of\r\npropagating. The tree is very hardy, a free grower, with very dark\r\nreddish brown, slightly grayish, young wood, forming an erect, round\r\nhead, bearing early and abundantly. In quality it is not first rate, but\r\nfrom its early productiveness, habit of blooming late in the spring\r\nafter late frosts, good size, fair, even fruit, keeping and carrying\r\nwell, it is very popular in all the Southwest and West. Fruit medium to\r\nlarge. Form roundish, truncated conical, often sides unequal. Color\r\nyellowish, almost entirely overspread, splashed and striped with two\r\nshades of red, and dotted sparsely with aureole dots. Stalk medium,\r\nrather slender. Cavity narrow, deep, russeted. Calyx partially open.\r\nBasin wide, abrupt, slightly corrugated. Flesh white, tender, moderately\r\njuicy, pleasant, subacid. Core medium to large. Good to very good.\r\nDecember to March.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Ben Davis by members of the State Horticultural Society:\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman (Leavenworth county): I favor Ben Davis because of its\r\nlarge size and good appearance; because it is long-lived, and attractive\r\nin appearance in market; because it is an early bearer; and, to sum it\r\nall up, because it is profitable to grow.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison (Butler county): I favor Ben Davis because it is one of\r\nthe most hardy, even, regular bearers; because it succeeds on a great\r\nvariety of soils. It is handsome in appearance and attracts the eye in\r\nevery market.\r\n\r\nF. W. Dixon (Jackson county): I favor Ben Davis because it is the most\r\nprofitable variety.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux (Shawnee county): It has a quality of sticking on until we\r\nare ready to pick. It gives good returns for our investment.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Maxey (Franklin county): I favor it because of its large size and\r\nattractive appearance.\r\n\r\nG. L. Holsinger (Wyandotte county): I vote for it.\r\n\r\nG. W. Bailey (Sumner county): The Ben Davis has been the most profitable\r\nwith us. It is very attractive and popular, and a good seller.\r\n\r\nA member: On account of its large size, attractive appearance, and good\r\nmarket qualities, I vote for it.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith (Douglas county): I vote for it because it is the best\r\ncommercial apple we have and stands high in the European markets. It\r\nsells for six dollars a barrel in Hamburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINESAP.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Winesop and Potpie Apple.\r\n\r\nThis is not only a good apple for the table, but it is also one of the\r\nvery finest cider fruits, and its fruitfulness renders it a great\r\nfavorite with orchardists. The tree grows rather irregularly, and does\r\nnot form a handsome head, but it bears early, and the apples have the\r\ngood quality of hanging late upon the trees without injury, while the\r\ntree thrives well on sandy, light soils. The tree is very hardy, and one\r\nof the most profitable orchard varieties wherever grown. Young wood\r\nreddish brown, with smooth red buds. Fruit of medium size, rather\r\nroundish oblong. Skin smooth, of a fine dark red, with a few streaks,\r\nand a little yellow ground appearing on the shady side. Stalk nearly an\r\ninch long, slender, set in an irregular cavity. Calyx small, placed in a\r\nregular basin, with fine plaits. Flesh yellow, firm, crisp, with a rich,\r\nhigh flavor. Very good. November to May.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Winesap by members of the State Horticultural Society:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook (Wabaunsee county): I strongly favor the Winesap, preferring\r\nit to any apple I grow.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison (Butler county): The Winesap is desirable because of its\r\ndeep, rich color, its attractiveness, and high flavor. Its one principal\r\ndefect is over bearing. It is a good seller.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: The excellences of the Winesap consist in its color, its\r\nflavor, and its keeping quality. I would not recommend it for a\r\ncommercial orchard. I recommend it for the family orchard only.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano (Missouri): That is my view. I would not recommend it as a\r\ncommercial apple. The tree grows straggling, and is subject to insects,\r\nand the winds affect them greatly, making them unprofitable in our\r\norchards. As a family apple, when grown to perfection, we can hardly\r\ndispense with it.\r\n\r\nF. W. Dixon: The Winesap trees on my farm are twenty-five years old, and\r\nlast year yielded ten bushels of marketable apples [per tree], besides\r\nculls. I would not recommend the Winesap as a commercial apple, as it is\r\nusually small.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I must say a good word for the Winesap. It has many traits\r\nagainst it for profit; yet I would give it a place in the commercial\r\norchard. It falls early, and must be picked early; but if planted in\r\ngood, rich, black soil it will as a rule do well. It commands a good\r\nprice, and is a good apple for variety. We cannot make it a leader, but\r\nshould keep it among our commercial apples.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp (Morris county): I consider it a good apple for my soil. It\r\nis a good apple if planted in a cool and moist red clay. In this they\r\ngrow to a marketable size.\r\n\r\nG. L. Holsinger: I think I would not plant another Winesap, unless for\r\nfamily use. I would place it fifth or sixth on the list. After one or\r\ntwo good crops they generally play out. This year they were about the\r\nsize of crab-apples.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: The Winesap in Butler county is prone to spur blight. In\r\nsummer, when the hot sun comes, they dry up in clusters. As far south as\r\nwe are they are hardly profitable. Farther north they do better. In\r\nIllinois, from one square of 200 trees (Winesaps) I gathered 3000\r\nbushels of apples, in 1871.\r\n\r\nG. W. Bailey: I know no better apple for family use. In our country, in\r\nthe low lands, they are fine, of fair size, producing well. While the\r\ntree is young the fruit is fine; after it gets older it overbears, and\r\nthe fruit becomes small. I would not plant it for market.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter (Geary county): I consider the Winesap good for family\r\norchards, but when old inclined to overbear, which enfeebles the tree.\r\nWhile the tree is young it is among the best. It does not pay for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: I would drop it from the commercial list. If I were to\r\nplant 1000 trees I would plant only 200 Winesaps. I prefer the Ben\r\nDavis, but we should not all grow the same apple. We want variety.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: Every one likes Winesaps, but we cannot grow them at\r\nordinary prices.\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Whiteker (Shawnee county): I do not know a better apple. As\r\nremarked, when the tree gets old the fruit runs down in size. It is very\r\ndeceiving. When it appears overloaded there are often not many on it.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: It has disappointed us every year. Some years they\r\nare very full, but many go to the cull piles. I vote against the\r\nWinesap. We have not planted any for ten years. Mr. Walter Wellhouse is\r\nhere. He can tell us about the Winesap.\r\n\r\nWalter Wellhouse (Shawnee county): My experience is that, like some\r\nother apples, they will not grow in poor soils, but if the soil is\r\nsuitable they are profitable.\r\n\r\nDr. G. Bohrer (Rice county): I have noticed it is not so much in the\r\nquality of the soil as the quantity of moisture in it. Having trees on\r\nhigh ground, I irrigated one of them, and it bore fine apples. In\r\nArkansas, where the land is too poor to raise corn the Winesap does\r\nwell; but it will not grow on high, dry soil. They must have more than\r\nthe ordinary amount of moisture.\r\n\r\nSecretary Barnes: T. W. Harrison, ex-mayor of Topeka, has Winesap apples\r\ngrowing about seven miles southwest of the city that are phenomenal.\r\nThey are the largest I ever saw. They have been exhibited at our past\r\nmeetings, and people would hardly believe them Winesaps. He cannot\r\naccount for it; says it must be some kind of freak. I examined the trees\r\nmyself. They are well grown, on high, rolling prairie. I would recommend\r\nthose who desire Winesaps to get scions from Mr. Harrison. He has seven\r\nor eight trees in his orchard, all in one row, far ahead of any Winesaps\r\nI ever saw.\r\n\r\nDr. G. Bohrer: Do you know whether there is a source of drainage to that\r\npoint?\r\n\r\nSecretary Barnes: I do not. The trees are probably eighteen years old,\r\nand on rolling land.\r\n\r\nJ. B. McAfee (Shawnee county): I have 145 Winesap trees in my orchard on\r\nhigh ground. They do reasonably well, but are not as large as Mr.\r\nHarrison's.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: Mr. Harrison's orchard lies on a southern slope. It is good\r\norchard land. The soil is very loose. His Missouri Pippins are as good\r\nin proportion as his Winesaps. His apples are all good.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Maxey: We have 300 or 400 acres in Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and\r\nJanet. I would not discard the Winesap.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONATHAN.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: King Philip and Philip Rick.\r\n\r\nThe Jonathan is a very beautiful dessert apple, and its great beauty,\r\ngood flavor and productiveness in all soils unite to recommend it to\r\norchard planters. The original tree of this variety is growing on the\r\nfarm of Mr. Philip Rick, of Kingston, N. Y. It was first described by\r\nthe late Judge Buel, and named by him in compliment to Jonathan\r\nHasbrouck, Esq., of the same place, who made known the fruit to him. It\r\nsucceeds wherever grown, and proves one of the best in quality, and most\r\nprofitable either for table or market. The tree is hardy, moderately\r\nvigorous, forming an upright, spreading, round head. Young shoots rather\r\nslender, slightly pendulous, grayish brown. Fruit of medium size,\r\nregularly formed, roundish conical, or tapering to the eye. Skin thin\r\nand smooth, the ground clear light yellow, nearly covered by lively red\r\nstripes, and deepening into brilliant or dark red in the sun. Stalk\r\nthree-fourths of an inch long, rather slender, inserted in a deep,\r\nregular cavity. Calyx set in a deep, rather broad basin. Flesh white,\r\nrarely a little pinkish, very tender and juicy, with a mild, sprightly,\r\nvinous flavor. This fruit evidently belongs to the Spitzenburg class.\r\nBest. November to March.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Jonathan by members of the State Horticultural Society:\r\n\r\nDr. G. Bohrer: Jonathan is probably the best apple I grow. They sell for\r\nthe highest price in the general market. They produce fewer culls than\r\nother varieties. It is not a profuse bearer as far south as I am [Rice\r\ncounty]. It ripens too early, and is affected by strong winds.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: The Jonathan is one of the most desirable all-around\r\napples, excellent as a dessert fruit, of a beautiful deep, bright color,\r\nof good quality and strong constitution. It is often called a fall\r\napple, yet, if put in cold storage, it may be brought out even in June\r\nin good condition. I place it third as a commercial fruit.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: The Jonathan should be picked early and put in cold storage.\r\nI would place it second as a commercial apple.\r\n\r\nW. J. Griffing (Riley county): We consider it about fourth on the list\r\nas a commercial apple.\r\n\r\nJ. B. McAfee: It is large, and about the second for profits in my\r\norchard, which has been planted twenty-seven years.\r\n\r\nF. W. Dixon: I would place the Jonathan about third as a commercial\r\napple. In our county it is longer lived than any other apple tree and\r\nfreer from insects.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp: Its only objection is its inclination to fall. I suppose,\r\nif picked early and put in cold storage, they may be as good, but do not\r\nlook as well.\r\n\r\nWalter Wellhouse: I think the demand for Jonathan is declining some\r\namong large dealers. A few years ago they sold for an advance of from\r\nfifty cents to one dollar per barrel. In Minneapolis and Chicago the\r\nmarket still seems good for them; but if I were to plant now I would not\r\nplant as many Jonathans as five or ten years ago.\r\n\r\nG. P. Whiteker: The Jonathan sells better in our market [Topeka] than\r\nany other apple. They have a good reputation; none better. They must be\r\npicked early.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I would place it fifth commercially, it drops so early,\r\nbefore coloring up; it stands more abuse than any other apple we have,\r\nand, if gathered early, will keep even without cold storage until the\r\nmarket improves.\r\n\r\nDr. Q. Bohrer: I agree with Mr. Sharp. I think the farther west we go\r\nthe poorer the fruit gets. You have more rainfall in the eastern part of\r\nthe state. It is hardy, possibly hardier than Ben Davis, but it falls\r\nearly. It is much like Winesap, requiring more moisture than other\r\nvarieties. When not much exposed to winds it does well. Of late our\r\nrainfall is not sufficient, and they are not doing so well, but since\r\ntrying irrigation they do better.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: I live too far west for the Jonathan. It will not stand\r\ndrought or wind. It ripens too early. It is a cold-storage apple. The\r\nworst spur blight I ever saw was on them.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: It is a good wet-weather apple. If there is plenty of\r\nmoisture, they do fine. I gather them about the 10th of September, and\r\nthey keep until the next spring. I tried to see how long I could keep\r\nthem. They should be about third on the commercial list.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI PIPPIN.\r\n\r\n_Synonym_: Missouri Keeper.\r\n\r\nIt is said to have originated in the orchard of Brink Hornsby, Johnson\r\ncounty, Missouri. Tree hardy, a strong, upright, rather spreading\r\ngrower, an early and abundant annual bearer. Fruit medium to large,\r\nroundish oblate, slightly oblique, somewhat flattened at the ends; skin\r\npale, whitish yellow, shaded, striped and splashed with light and dark\r\nred, often quite dark in the sun, having many large and small light and\r\ngray dots; stalk short, small; cavity large, deep; calyx closed, or half\r\nopen; basin rather abrupt, deep, slightly corrugated; flesh whitish, a\r\nlittle coarse, crisp or breaking, moderately juicy, subacid; good; core\r\nsmall. January to April.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Missouri Pippin by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: I am a warm friend of the Missouri Pippin, and vote it\r\nsecond. It is a short-lived tree, but brings paying returns for expense\r\nand trouble. It has a fairly good flavor.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: The Missouri Pippin is a young and profuse bearer, and\r\nquite hardy with me. I should place it second on the list.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: I have eliminated it from my family orchard, and give it\r\nonly standing-room as a commercial fruit, and there rate it second [in\r\nquality]. There can be more money made from it in a few years than from\r\nany apple we have. It is the youngest bearing tree we have. It grows to\r\na good size, and by some is preferred to Ben Davis. The great merit of\r\nthis apple is in its youthful productiveness, good color, and marketable\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: I do not approve of planting it thickly, intending to let it\r\nremain. It is apt to overbear, break in pieces, and become almost\r\nworthless. With proper care and thinning when too thick we can partially\r\novercome this.\r\n\r\nW. J. Griffing: It is my second best apple. I consider the Winesap the\r\nbest, as it has paid me the best, and I am planting for winter profit\r\nonly these two. All apple trees die young with us.\r\n\r\nF. W. Dixon: I can add nothing new, but place it second on the list.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp: It has been my most profitable variety. About four-fifths\r\nhave been marketable. As to dying young, I would rather grow new ones.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: We will have to stick to it awhile yet in Kansas.\r\nWhen of good size they command a price in advance of the Ben Davis.\r\n\r\nG. P. Whiteker: It gives good satisfaction as a commercial apple. It\r\nbears young; and you can get good returns for eight or ten years, and\r\nthen put out a new orchard.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I would place the Missouri Pippin second on the commercial\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: It is the youngest to bear. It is a Western apple. Other\r\nvarieties gradually die out, but it sticks. The farther west you go the\r\nbetter it is. It stands drought and wind best of all. While it breaks\r\noff on the top, it is not a short-lived tree.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: I would place it second on the commercial list.\r\n\r\n\r\nGANO.\r\n\r\nOrigin, Howard county, Missouri. Tree very hardy; has never been injured\r\nby the cold winters; bears very young, roots readily from its own stock,\r\nand can almost be grown from a cutting. Fruit bright red on yellow\r\nground, no stripes; large, oblong, tapering to the eye; surface smooth,\r\ntakes a very high polish, making it valuable as a stand fruit, thought\r\nby many to surpass the Ben Davis. Minute dots; basin shallow, sometimes\r\ndeep; stem medium to long; flesh white, fine grained, tender, mild,\r\npleasant subacid. An early, annual and prolific bearer. December to May.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Gano by members of the State Horticultural Society:\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: I cannot be against my namesake. I have found nothing yet\r\nthat excels the parent trees. The Gano is creating a sensation, more\r\nespecially in the southern part of Missouri. They prefer it to Ben\r\nDavis, and, where extensively planted and in bearing, it is creating a\r\nsensation. While I have no interest in it, other than the name, still I\r\nthink we have in the Gano something that will stay. It is much like Ben\r\nDavis.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: I would class it and the Ben Davis as twins.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp: I planted about 700 trees of it five years ago. This year I\r\nraised five apples. Two of these could not be told from Ben Davis. One\r\nlooked like Jonathan.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: I class it with Ben Davis. It differs little except in\r\ncolor. Trees are alike, but I think it a younger bearer. I got my grafts\r\nfrom Lee's Summit, Mo., paying five dollars per 100 for them. One tree I\r\ngave to a friend was this year a wonder to all who saw it.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: We have seventy or eighty acres in Gano, planted\r\nfive or six years ago. While the tree is much like Ben Davis, I can\r\ndistinguish a difference in the apples. If I pile both kinds together I\r\ncan see a difference; if I pick out a Gano and put it in the Ben Davis\r\npile, neither I nor any other man on earth can tell it from the Ben\r\nDavis. I do not know whether it is distinct from the Ben Davis or not.\r\nIf it is Ben Davis, it is all right. I hope it is distinct, but have so\r\nfar been unable to settle the question.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: We originally found only one tree in an orchard in Pratt\r\ncounty, Missouri, and in the same orchard there were plenty of Ben Davis\r\ntrees. There may have been a mix-up of these varieties, but you will not\r\nbe disappointed if you get the Gano.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: Before planting, I went to Lee's Summit for three\r\nor four years in succession and examined the original trees, to see\r\nwhether we ought to plant any; we concluded to plant, for if they were\r\nnot a new apple they would be the Ben Davis anyhow. We may have obtained\r\nBen Davis trees.\r\n\r\nMrs. A. Z. Moore: My husband handles many of them on commission, and\r\nfavors them both in the orchard and in the market. He says they are\r\nknown as Jonathan, not as Gano, and while you may not distinguish them\r\nin a pile of Ben Davis, you will know the difference if you put your\r\nteeth into them.\r\n\r\n\r\nYORK IMPERIAL.\r\n\r\n_Synonym_: Johnson's Fine Winter.\r\n\r\nOrigin thought to be York county, Pennsylvania. Tree moderately\r\nvigorous, productive. Young wood rich brown, downy. Fruit medium, oblate\r\noblique, whitish, shaded with crimson in the sun, thinly sprinkled with\r\nlight and gray dots. Stalk short. Calyx closed, or partially open. Basin\r\nlarge, deep. Flesh yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, pleasant, mild\r\nsubacid. Good to very good. Core compact, small. November to February.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the York Imperial by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: I have planted heavily of York Imperial. They are not yet in\r\nfull bearing. They have given me good results. The trees are of large\r\nsize and the growth indicates that they will be strong bearers. They are\r\nof rather a twig growth. I would put them about sixth on the commercial\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: The York Imperial is an old apple. It is new to many of us\r\nbecause of its late sudden popularity. It has been sent to Europe,\r\nholding its own with Missouri Pippin and others. It is large, a good\r\nkeeper, and growers always seem pleased with it. It seems to be growing\r\npopular.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp: I have about 500 or 600 trees I planted on the\r\nrecommendation of President Wellhouse, six years ago. This year they\r\nproduced about 100 bushels. I think they will be profitable.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: I saw a gentleman from St. Louis who gathered about\r\nten car-loads, and he was favorably impressed with it. We have many\r\ntrees bearing. It keeps well in cellars.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I would place them third on the commercial list.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: Mine are just beginning to bear. It is not a youthful\r\nbearer. I think it will be a popular apple.\r\n\r\nG. L. Holsinger: They commence to bear young. We have some that are\r\ntwenty-two years old. This year they were full. Like the Jonathan, they\r\nmature too early and fall off. What I put in the cellar this year kept\r\nwell, very few rotting.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAWLE'S JANET.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Missouri Janet, Red Neverfail, Rawle's Jannet, Rawle's\r\nJannetting, Rawle's Genet, Rock Remain, Rock Rimmon, Yellow Janett,\r\nWinter Jannetting, Jeniton, Jennett, Neverfail, Indiana Jannetting, and\r\nRaul's Gennetting.\r\n\r\nOriginated in Amherst county, Virginia, on the farm of Caleb Rawle. Tree\r\nhardy, vigorous, spreading. It puts forth its leaves and blossoms much\r\nlater than other varieties in the spring, and consequently avoids\r\ninjury by late frost; it is, therefore, particularly valuable for the\r\nSouth and Southwest, where it is much cultivated. Young wood clear\r\nreddish brown; fruit rather large, oblate conic, yellowish, shaded with\r\nred and striped with crimson; stalk short and thick, inserted in a\r\nbroad, open cavity; calyx partially open, set in a rather shallow basin;\r\nflesh whitish yellow, tender, juicy, pleasant subacid; good to very\r\ngood; February to June.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Rawle's Janet by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: I have been acquainted with the Janet from boyhood, but I\r\nhave little, if any, use for them, because they overbear. It is a hard\r\ntree for me to do anything with; cannot get them into shape--die quick.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: I would only recommend a tree or two of them for the\r\nfamily orchard. It has had its day in the West, and is succeeded by more\r\nprofitable varieties.\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris (Osage county): I would not plant them to sell. They are\r\ntoo subject to diseases--bitter rot, etc.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: I think it could be discarded altogether.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp: Will not pay for commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nG. P. Whiteker: Janets bring a good price. They are late keepers. We\r\nkept ours this year until we began to pick apples the following fall. It\r\nis not a good commercial apple.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I would place it on the retired list.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: Only fit for family use. Trees overbear; fruit small.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: I would place it on the retired list.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH'S CIDER.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Smith's, Fuller, Pennsylvania Cider, Popular Bluff, and\r\nFowler.\r\n\r\nOrigin, Bucks county, Pennsylvania. This apple is widely grown and much\r\nesteemed as a profitable market sort. The tree is a very vigorous,\r\nstraggling, spreading grower, and productive. Young wood a rich, dark\r\nbrown. Fruit medium to large, roundish oblate conic, yellow, shaded and\r\nstriped with red, sparsely covered with gray dots. Stalk slender, of\r\nmedium length, inserted in a deep, rather narrow cavity. Calyx closed,\r\nset in a broad, rather shallow basin. Flesh whitish, tender, juicy,\r\ncrisp, pleasant, mild subacid. Good December to March.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Smith's Cider by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: I planted Smith's Cider pretty heavily, and now regret it.\r\nIt blights badly, and the apples fall off. I intend to replace it with\r\nYork Imperial.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: It deserves a place in the family orchard, and a small\r\nplace in the commercial orchard. They are as large as Ben Davis, and as\r\ngreat bearers, but they fall from the tree sooner.\r\n\r\nJames Sharp: We had 500 Smith's Cider. Nearly all blighted and died;\r\nhave never paid me.\r\n\r\nG. Whiteker: It is a splendid apple, but blights; I think it will not be\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: We should not drop it from the list; it is a fairly good\r\napple.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAIDEN'S BLUSH.\r\n\r\nA remarkably beautiful apple, a native of New Jersey, and first\r\ndescribed by Coxe. It begins to ripen about the 20th of August, and\r\ncontinues until the last of October. It has all the beauty of color of\r\nthe pretty little Lady Apple, and is much cultivated and admired, both\r\nfor the table and for cooking. It is also very highly esteemed for\r\ndrying. This variety forms a handsome, rapid-growing tree, with a fine\r\nspreading head, and bears large crops. It is very valuable as a\r\nprofitable market sort. Fruit of medium size, very regularly shaped, and\r\na little narrow towards the eye. Skin smooth, with a delicate waxen\r\nappearance, pale lemon yellow in the shade, with a brilliant crimson\r\ncheek next the sun, the two colors often joining in brilliant red. Stalk\r\nshort, planted in a rather wide, deep hollow. Basin moderately\r\ndepressed. Calyx closed. Flesh white, tender, sprightly, pleasant\r\nsubacid. Good.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Maiden's Blush by the members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: It is all right to raise for a local market and for family\r\nuse. Hardy tree. I planted probably 100. I cannot determine where to\r\nplace it on the list. Probably others have had more experience with it\r\nthan I have.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: The Maiden's Blush deserves a place in both the family and\r\nthe commercial orchard. In its season it is unexcelled for market\r\npurposes, and is especially attractive. I should recommend it as a\r\ncommercial apple.\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris: I would place it first as a summer apple for local market.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: You certainly will not discard it.\r\n\r\nW. J. Griffing: It is about the earliest apple that will bear shipping\r\nin summer, and very profitable.\r\n\r\nF. W. Dixon: I find it rather a shy bearer, but the tree is long-lived\r\nand very hardy, and it deserves a place in the family orchard. I think\r\nthere is no profit in them for a commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: They are long-lived and very hardy; I would\r\nrecommend them for family, but not for commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nG. P. Whiteker: It comes at a time when there is much other fruit. I do\r\nnot think it pays very well. Mine turn brown from some cause.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: It is our very best apple in its season; while talking of\r\nthe commercial orchard, there is a demand for apples at all seasons of\r\nthe year, and if we discard this, we will have nothing at its season. I\r\nwould say, place it in the commercial orchard for export.\r\n\r\nW. J. Griffing: Do not know that it is profitable, but for quality the\r\nMaiden's Blush is worthy of a place among fruits.\r\n\r\nG. W. Bailey: As a summer apple for family and commercial orchards, I\r\nwould place it at the head of the list.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: It is the best apple of its season for all purposes.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: It is the best commercial apple for summer trade we have.\r\n\r\nSecretary Barnes: At the late meeting of the Missouri Horticultural\r\nSociety, the secretary stated that he thought there was good money in\r\nthe Maiden's Blush. He said the trouble was, they were raised in too\r\nlimited quantities. He said they should be raised in car lots for\r\nshipping to Northern cities; that they were quick growers and brought\r\nready money, and at their season had little competition in the market.\r\nThey come in when there are few apples obtainable, and he considers them\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris: In my experience it bears only every other year. Is that\r\nthe experience of others?\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: The Maiden's Blush is the only summer apple that we\r\nhave made pay.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: We have not grown Maiden's Blush very largely here. It is\r\none of our old apples in Illinois, and it is the earliest, most regular\r\nand profuse bearer, and the best keeper of its season to ship in hot\r\nweather. It was named for its beauty, and is the most attractive apple\r\ngrown. They last well if kept moderately cool. They are shipped largely\r\nin barrels, the earlier ones in boxes, from central Illinois north. The\r\ntree is tender in unusually cold seasons. Farther south there is no\r\ndanger. I find it is a good apple to sell in a small way to grocerymen.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRIMES'S GOLDEN PIPPIN.\r\n\r\n_Synonym_: Grimes's Golden.\r\n\r\nThis valuable apple originated many years since on the farm of Thomas\r\nGrimes, Brooke county, Virginia. In its native locality it is highly\r\nprized for the peculiar hardihood of the tree, withstanding uninjured\r\nthe most severe winters, and never breaking in its limbs; also, for its\r\nuniform regular annual productiveness. Tree vigorous, hardy, upright,\r\nspreading, very productive; branches with peculiar knobs at the base of\r\neach, connecting it with the main limbs. Young wood dark, dull red\r\nbrown, grayish. Fruit medium, roundish oblate, slightly conical. Skin\r\nuneven. Color rich golden yellow, sprinkled moderately with small gray\r\nand light dots. Stalk rather short and slender. Cavity rather deep,\r\nsometimes slightly russeted. Calyx closed, or partially open. Basin\r\nabrupt, uneven. Flesh yellow, compact, crisp, tender, juicy, rich,\r\nsprightly, spicy subacid; peculiar aroma. Core rather small. Very good\r\nto best. December to March.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Grimes's Golden Pippen by members of the State\r\nHorticultural Society:\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: I have not tried to ship any Grimes's Golden. I would place\r\nit about second on the list of summer [?] apples. With me it is a good,\r\nthrifty, hardy tree, but my orchard is young.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: I have grown it extensively. It is one of the best fall\r\napples and one of the beauties. It does not keep well. It rots badly\r\nafter it is gathered and goes to market in rather bad shape. It is not\r\nplanted as much now as in the past.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: It stands in quality beside the Jonathan, and is a\r\nfirst-class dessert apple. It is a good bearer and ought to be in every\r\nfamily orchard, but I would not recommend it for the commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris: Mine bore very heavily and were large and fine. Sold well\r\nlocally; never shipped any; think they should come next to the Maiden's\r\nBlush in the commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: The Grimes's Golden is the very best apple of its season.\r\nShould be in all family orchards, and have a small place in commercial\r\norchards.\r\n\r\nJ. B. McAfee: Like Mr. Gano, I consider it the very best apple that\r\ngrows, and one of the most profitable in my orchard. I find it\r\nshort-lived. I take best care of them for use of my family until about\r\nthe 1st of November.\r\n\r\nF. W. Dixon: It is the best apple for family use, but drops badly. The\r\ntree is a good bearer but not long-lived.\r\n\r\nG. P. Whiteker: I plant Grimes's Golden and Maiden's Blush for profit.\r\nThe Grimes's Golden is handsome and brings a good price, especially at\r\nthis time of the year--December.\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I have had experience with it for years. In the family\r\norchard we cannot do without it. We aim to keep it for our family as\r\nlong as it lasts, say until February. In my opinion it is better than\r\nany pear that grows in our state. We should handle them with care, as we\r\ndo pears. Put away carefully, in a cold, dry cellar, they retain their\r\nflavor and keep well. I think them worthy of a place in the commercial\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Maxey: I like to eat them; most of us do. There is a place for\r\nthem as a fancy apple.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: I consider it the best-flavored apple grown for family\r\nuse. Missouri and Arkansas have brought the big red apple into history,\r\nbut now the big yellow apple is preferred by many consumers. I consider\r\nthem extra fine.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: I pack mine in boxes as well as barrels. I consider them\r\nfine.\r\n\r\nG. Y. Johnson (Douglas county): I find the tree is not as hardy as I\r\nwould like to have it. As far as the apple is concerned, it sells as\r\nwell as any.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTSMAN'S FAVORITE.\r\n\r\nA seedling on the farm of John Huntsman, of Fayette, Mo. Tree vigorous,\r\nnot a very early bearer, but is very productive annually when the tree\r\nhas attained sufficient age; it is said to be a valuable and profitable\r\nfruit in the locality where it originated. Young shoots smooth, reddish\r\nbrown; fruit large, oblate, slightly conic, often a little oblate; skin\r\nsmooth, pale yellow, sometimes a shade of pale red or deep yellow in the\r\nsun, and a few scattering grayish dots; stalk short, small; cavity\r\nbroad, deep, sometimes slight russet; calyx closed, or nearly so; basin\r\nlarge, deep, slightly corrugated; flesh pale yellow, a little coarse,\r\ncrisp, tender, juicy, mild, rich subacid, slightly aromatic; very good;\r\ncore rather small. December to March.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Huntsman's Favorite by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: The Huntsman is long-lived and deserves a place in our\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: The Huntsman is of the York Imperial order, an old\r\nvariety, not sufficiently known. In Kansas City, I saw them on sale at\r\nsix dollars per barrel. The tree is a good bearer, and will be planted\r\nmore than it has been; it never blights.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: I agree with Mr. Holman.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: It is a very desirable orchard tree; it is just wonderful\r\nhow our old orchards hold out; its quality and size are good. It has one\r\nfault: if put in cold storage it bleaches out, as most yellow apples do.\r\nI cannot keep yellow apples in cold storage, and the Huntsman has\r\ndisappointed me; but if taken out and sold when just right it is a\r\nsuccess, and sells in Kansas City at six dollars per barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMOTH BLACK TWIG.\r\n\r\nThis apple originated with John Crawford, near Ray's Mills, Washington\r\ncounty, Arkansas. It is conceded to be a seedling of the Black Twig\r\n(said to be a misnomer for the Winesap). It has been exhibited as the\r\n\"Arkansaw.\" Mr. Crawford says he brought to Arkansas and planted seeds\r\nof the Limber Twig and Black Twig over fifty-five years ago, and this\r\napple sprang from one of those seeds. Really an enlarged and improved\r\nWinesap. Tree a fine, upright, spreading grower.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Mammoth Black Twig by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: My trees set fruit for three years, but it all dropped\r\noff.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: Mr. Munger says his were very small this year, but\r\nalso that all his apples were small.\r\n\r\nG. W. Bailey: I have a few, planted eight years, but the fruit this year\r\nwas very small.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: Many Mammoth Black Twig trees have been extensively\r\npropagated by nurserymen. We should know more about them. This variety\r\ncame before the public with a \"hurrah,\" and people were told it was an\r\napple with the quality of Winesap and the vigor of Ben Davis.\r\n\r\nMrs. A. Z. Moore (Missouri): My husband and I superintended sixty acres.\r\nWe grew 500 bushels of them, all very fine. Of the tree I know little,\r\nbut the apples were beautiful. They are of dark color and very handsome.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: Two years ago I was down the Port Arthur road, and saw\r\nsome, and they were fine-looking apples; but on testing it I thought\r\nmany others were better, though in the general trade I think it will do\r\nwell. We have a few trees and they are rapid growers, but I would not\r\nrecommend them for flavor.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams: I can give you no particular information on this apple, but\r\nbelieve in the right location it is as fine as any grown. Location has\r\nmuch to do with its success.\r\n\r\nWalter Wellhouse: I examined some Mammoth Black Twigs in Leavenworth,\r\nand they were of good size--as large as any Winesap I ever saw, and of\r\ngood color.\r\n\r\nL. D. Buck: It is a hardy grower. This year it is small.\r\n\r\n\r\nPECK'S PLEASANT.\r\n\r\n_Synonym_: Waltz Apple.\r\n\r\nA first-rate fruit in all respects, belonging to the Newtown Pippin\r\nclass. It has long been cultivated in Rhode Island (where, we think, it\r\noriginated) and in the northern part of Connecticut, and deserves\r\nextensive dissemination. It considerably resembles the Yellow Newtown\r\nPippin, with more tender flesh, and is scarcely inferior to it in\r\nflavor. The tree is a moderate, upright, spreading grower, but bears\r\nregularly and well, and the fruit commands a high price in the market.\r\nThe apples on the lower branches of old trees are flat, while those on\r\nthe upper branches are nearly conical. Young shoots reddish brown,\r\nslightly downy. Fruit above medium size, roundish, a little ribbed, and\r\nslightly flattened, with an indistinct furrow on one side. Skin smooth,\r\nand, when first gathered, green, with a little dark red; but when ripe a\r\nbeautiful clear yellow, with bright blush on the sunny side and near the\r\nstalk, marked with scattered gray dots. The stalk is peculiarly fleshy\r\nand flattened, short, and sunk in a wide, rather wavy cavity. Calyx\r\nwoolly, sunk in a narrow, abruptly and pretty deeply sunk basin. Flesh\r\nyellowish, fine grained, juicy, crisp and tender, with a delicious, high\r\naromatic, sprightly subacid. Very good or best. November to March.\r\n\r\nRemarks on Peck's Pleasant by members of the State Horticultural\r\nSociety:\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris: We have a large number; while generally small, they can be\r\nmade larger by cultivation and care. They are the longest keepers I know\r\nof, and carry well in shipping.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cutter: I was well acquainted with it in Illinois.\r\n\r\nSecretary Barnes: About a year and a half ago, Governor Morrill said to\r\nme, \"Why don't you get your people to grow Peck's Pleasant? It is the\r\nbest apple grown.\"\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: I have several trees, planted in 1870. They have been\r\nlight bearers. The apple is of high quality, and keeps until January.\r\nThe color is not so good as Huntsman. They die early.\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris: I cannot agree to that. I never had one die.\r\n\r\nC. C. Cook: It is a good apple for home use; not very profitable.\r\n\r\nW. G. Gano: Good family apple; green; subacid; elegant in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nINGRAM.\r\n\r\nA new variety, grown from seed of Rawle's Janet, by Martin Ingram, of\r\nGreene county, Missouri. Tree productive, and the fruit especially\r\nvalued for its long keeping. Fruit medium, or below, roundish oblate,\r\norange yellow, mostly overspread with broken stripes of rich, warm red,\r\ngray russet dots, and slight marblings. Stalk slender. Calyx small.\r\nFlesh yellowish white, moderately juicy, crisp, mild subacid. Core above\r\nmedium. Seeds dark brown. February to June. (Hort.)\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Ingram by members of the State Horticultural Society:\r\n\r\nMrs. A. Z. Moore: I speak of this as the \"coming apple\" in southern\r\nMissouri. They are not very large; beautiful in color; have a tendency\r\nto overbear and grow in clusters. Must be picked by hand; is free from\r\ncommon diseases.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Maxey: I am greatly interested in it. Very late last spring, while\r\nin Kansas City, I noticed a variety of apples that looked so fresh, with\r\nstems as green as if just picked, in shape and color like large Janets.\r\nThey had come out of cold storage. I asked the name, and was told they\r\nwere Ingram. I was told they were grown in the vicinity of Garden City,\r\nKan. I wrote to Garden City, and received an answer from the grower,\r\nsaying this apple was well worthy of growing.\r\n\r\nMrs. A. Z. Moore: I have seen it kept until the following August.\r\n\r\nG. P. Whiteker: I got twenty barrels of them from Mr. Rose in Kansas\r\nCity. I brought them here [Topeka] and retailed most of them, and got\r\nsix dollars per barrel for them. I do not think we found two bad apples\r\nto the barrel. Most people thought them Janets. I believe it a\r\nprofitable tree to plant.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: In collecting apples in Douglas county for the World's\r\nFair, we could not tell them from the Janet, except in size. It is\r\nbeautifully streaked, and the grower called it a variety of the Janet.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOWELL.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Queen Anne, Tallow Apple, Michigan Golden, Golden Pippin of\r\nsome, Greasy Pippin, and Orange.\r\n\r\nOrigin unknown. Tree hardy, vigorous, spreading, productive. Young wood\r\nreddish brown. Fruit large, roundish, oval or conic, bright waxen\r\nyellow, oily. Stalk of medium length. Cavity deep, uneven. Basin deep,\r\nabrupt, and furrowed. Calyx closed. Flesh yellowish white, with a brisk,\r\nrich, rather acid flavor. Good to very good. September, October.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the Lowell by members of the State Horticultural Society:\r\n\r\nJ. B. McAfee: I have realized more from my Lowells than from any other\r\napple in my orchard. They are early and prolific. The Lowell has been\r\nthe best-paying and the easiest-selling apple in our market [Topeka].\r\n\r\nPhillip Lux: I planted mine in 1870. They blight badly and the fruit is\r\noften knotty. Have made no money from them.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: I grew it in Illinois. I planted it here in 1879 and\r\n1880, and it paid there and here. It is a large, green, smooth apple,\r\nand follows the Maiden's Blush closely. The tree did not blight with me\r\nthere or here. It is best cooked. It does not get mellow or soft. It is\r\nan old variety and is falling out.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: This apple is all right in such a market as Topeka in its\r\nseason. It is not good to ship. Another apple we know little of is the\r\nOrange Pippin. There is two or three dollars in it where there is one\r\ndollar in the Maiden's Blush. It can be shipped to Liverpool and back in\r\ngood condition. No other will compare with it in productiveness. It\r\nought to be on our list.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELESTIA.\r\n\r\nOriginated with L. S.

October.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINKLER.\r\n\r\n_Synonym_: Brandywine.\r\n\r\nThis is an old variety which was first exhibited before the Illinois\r\nHorticultural Society, and, because it could not be identified,\r\nreceived, for the time being, the name of its exhibitor. At some future\r\ntime it will probably be found identical with some variety long since\r\nnamed and described. Tree an irregular grower; good bearer and keeper.\r\nFruit medium, roundish oblate, slightly conic, pale greenish yellow,\r\nstriped and splashed with two shades of red.

It originated on the\r\nfarm of Herman Chapin, of East Bloomfield, near Rochester, N. Y. The\r\ntrees require high culture, and open heads to let in the sun; otherwise\r\nthe fruit is wanting in flavor, and apt to be imperfect and knotty.\r\nYoung shoots dark, reddish brown. The tree blooms late, often escaping\r\nvernal frosts. Fruit large, roundish, oblate, conical. Skin thin,\r\nsmooth, in the shade greenish or pale yellow, in the sun covered with\r\nlight and dark stripes of purplish red, marked with a few pale dots, and\r\na thin white bloom.

It is a good, sprightly fruit, though not\r\nvery high flavored, but its remarkably handsome appearance and large\r\nsize render it one of the most popular fruits in the market. The tree is\r\nthrifty, and makes a compact, neat head; bears regular crops, and the\r\nfruit is always fair and handsome. Young wood rich, brownish red. Fruit\r\nvery large, roundish, slightly uneven, greenish yellow, boldly splashed\r\nand marbled with stripes of purplish red. Stalk short, set in a wide,\r\ndeep cavity. Calyx small.

It bears abundantly with us, and\r\nits singular richness of color is heightened by an exquisite bloom on\r\nthe surface of the fruit, like that of the plum. It is one of the\r\nhandsomest dessert fruits, and its quality is good, but if not taken\r\nfrom the trees as soon as ripe it is liable to become mealy. Tree a\r\nvigorous grower, upright, spreading. An early and abundant bearer. Young\r\nshoots clear, reddish brown. Fruit pretty large, rather above the middle\r\nsize, and very smooth and fair, roundish, a little narrowed toward the\r\neye.

The tree is very vigorous,\r\ngrows remarkably straight and upright, comes early into bearing, and\r\nyields enormously every year. Young shoots clear, reddish brown,\r\nslightly grayish. Fruit rather above medium size, oblong, regularly\r\nshaped, and tapering slightly towards the eye; dark red, dotted with\r\nfawn-colored specks, and covered with a blue bloom. Flesh yellowish,\r\nvery tender and mellow, usually sweet and rich. Good to very good. In\r\nweight the apple is light. October to February.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE JUNEATING.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Joanneting, Juniting, Gennetting, Primiting, May of\r\nVirginia, Jennetting, Juneting, May Pippin, Caroline, Early May, Owen's\r\nGolden Beauty, Juneating, Ginetting, Early Jennetting, Yellow May,\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\nThis is an old variety, mentioned by Evelyn in 1660, and described by\r\nRay in 1688, and is a very tolerable little apple, ripening among the\r\nvery earliest, during the last of June and the first of July. It is very\r\ndistinct from the Early Harvest, sometimes called by this name. Tree a\r\nmoderate grower, and forms a roundish, upright, spreading head.\r\nProductive. Fruit small, round, a little flattened. Calyx closed. Stalk\r\nrather long and slender. Pale green at first, light yellow with\r\nsometimes a faint blush on the sunny side.

The tree is a vigorous grower, forming a handsome\r\nbranching head, and bears very large crops. Young shoots dull, grayish\r\nbrown, slightly downy. It is worthy of extensive orchard culture. Fruit\r\nlarge, roundish oblong, much narrowed near the eye. Skin smooth, striped\r\nwith splashes and irregular broken stripes of pale and bright red, which\r\nnearly cover a yellowish ground. Calyx open. Stalk short, in a russeted\r\nhollow. Flesh yellow, juicy, and tender, with an agreeable mingling of\r\nsweetness and acidity in its flavor. Very good to best. October to\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLAND PIPPIN.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Summer Pippin, Pie Apple.\r\n\r\nThis and the Fall Pippin are frequently confounded together. They are\r\nindeed of the same origin. One of the strongest points of difference\r\nlies in their time of ripening. The Holland Pippin begins to fall from\r\nthe trees and is fit for pies about the middle of August, and from that\r\ntime to the first of November is one of the very best kitchen apples.\r\nFruit very large, roundish, a little more square in outline than the\r\nFall Pippin, and not so much flattened, though a good deal like it, a\r\nlittle narrowed next the eye. Stalk half an inch long, thick, deeply\r\nsunk. Calyx small, closed, moderately sunk in a slight plaited basin.\r\nSkin greenish yellow or pale green, becoming pale yellow when fully\r\nripe, washed on one side with a little dull red or pale brown, with a\r\nfew scattered, large, greenish dots. Good.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW TRANSPARENT.\r\n\r\nA new Russian variety, which was imported from St. Petersburg in 1870 by\r\nthe department of agriculture, Washington, D. C., and promises to be\r\nvaluable for a cold climate as an early fruit of good quality, ripening\r\nbefore the Tetofsky, with more tender and delicate flesh, but does not\r\ncontinue long in use. It is said that the tree so far has proved to be\r\nvery hardy, moderately vigorous, upright, an early and good bearer\r\nannually. Fruit medium, roundish, oblate, slightly conical, slightly\r\nangular; skin clear white at first, becoming pale yellow when fully\r\nmature, moderately sprinkled with light and greenish dots, somewhat\r\nobscure. Stalk short to medium, rather slender; cavity rather large,\r\nsometimes a little greenish; calyx closed; basin medium, slightly\r\ncorrugated, sometimes small protuberances; flesh white, half fine,\r\ntender, juicy, sprightly subacid; quality good to very good.

September.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SUMMER PEARMAIN.\r\n\r\n_Synonym_: American Summer Pearmain.\r\n\r\nA rich, highly flavored fruit, much esteemed where it is known. It\r\nappears to be quite different from the Summer Pearmain (of the English),\r\nand is probably a seedling raised from it. It ripens gradually from the\r\n10th of August to the last of September. Tree moderately vigorous, with\r\nslender branches, round headed. Young shoots dull, reddish brown. Fruit\r\nof medium size, oblong, widest at the crown, and tapering slightly to\r\nthe eye.

January to March.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIE.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: English Rambo, Wells, Cheat, Hogan, Striped Rhode Island\r\nGreening, Cling Tight, English Red Streak, and English Beauty of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThis apple, extensively planted in the orchards on the Hudson and west,\r\nso much resembles the Rambo externally that the two are often\r\nconfounded, and the outline of the Rambo may be taken as nearly a\r\n_facsimile_ of this. The Dominie is, however, of a livelier color, and\r\nthe flavor and season of the two fruits are very distinct, the Rambo\r\nbeing rather a high-flavored early winter apple, while the Dominie is a\r\nsprightly, juicy, long-keeping winter fruit. Fruit of medium size, flat.\r\nSkin lively greenish yellow in the shade, with stripes and splashes of\r\nbright red in the sun, and pretty large russet specks. Stalk long and\r\nslender, planted in a wide cavity, and inclined to one side. Calyx\r\nsmall, in a broad basin, moderately sunk. Flesh white, exceedingly\r\ntender and juicy, with a sprightly, pleasant, though not high flavor.\r\nYoung wood of a shoot lively light brown, and the trees are very hardy,\r\nand the most rapid growers and prodigious early bearers that we\r\nknow--the branches being literally weighted down by the rope-like\r\nclusters of fruit. The Dominie does not appear to be described by any\r\nforeign author. Coxe says that he received it from England, but the\r\napple he describes and figures does not appear to be ours, and we have\r\nnever met with it in any collection here. It is highly probable that the\r\nDominie is a native fruit. It is excellent from December to April.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND GREENING.\r\n\r\n_Synonyms_: Burlington Greening, Russine, Bell Dubois, and Jersey\r\nGreening.\r\n\r\nThe Rhode Island Greening is such a universal favorite, and so generally\r\nknown, that it seems superfluous to describe it. It succeeds well in\r\nmost of the northern sections of the United States, and on a great\r\nvariety of soils. Where it succeeds it is one of the most esteemed and\r\nprofitable among early winter fruits. [In Kansas it drops too early.]\r\nTree a very vigorous, spreading grower. Young shoots reddish brown. Very\r\nproductive. [Shy in Kansas.] Fruit large, roundish, a little flattened,\r\npretty regular, but often obscurely ribbed, dark green, becoming\r\ngreenish yellow when ripe, when it sometimes shows a dull blush near the\r\nstalk.

Tree very hardy,\r\nforming a large, regular, upright, spreading, round head. Fruit a little\r\nabove the middle size, rather conical, with a few obscure ribs. Stalk\r\nshort and deeply set. Calyx rather large. Skin greenish yellow, washed\r\nwith a faint blush on one side.

(Thomas.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAll the descriptions of apples given here are taken from Downing's\r\n\"Fruit and Fruit-trees of America,\" excepting otherwise noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE, BY DISTRICTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience, Kansas was divided by the official board into four\r\nfruit districts, simply quartering the state. The first district is\r\ncomposed of the following twenty-seven counties, in the northeast\r\nquarter. Reports, or rather experiences, from each of these counties\r\nwill be found immediately following. We give below the number of apple\r\ntrees in the first district, compiled from the statistics of 1897.

We prefer for commercial orchard,\r\nJonathan, Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, Winesap, and York Imperial, and\r\nfor family orchard would add to these, Red June, Chenango, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Huntsman, and Rome Beauty. We tried sixteen acres of Cooper's\r\nEarly White, but have discarded them as unprofitable, shy bearers. We\r\nconsider upland the best if soil is of good quality. We have them on all\r\nslopes; can see no particular difference where soil is equal. We prefer\r\nrich, black soil (vegetable mold), clay subsoil. We plant in furrows,\r\nthe rows thirty-two feet apart, the trees sixteen feet apart in the\r\nrows, running north and south.\r\n\r\nThe best trees to plant are two years old, the lowest limb or limbs not\r\nover two feet from the ground. We grow most of our trees from our own\r\nroot grafts. Cultivation: We cultivate for the first five years, by\r\nthrowing the soil first to and then from the trees, with a single or a\r\ndouble turning plow, and grow only corn. At five years from planting we\r\nsow the ground to clover, and this with other growths, such as weeds, is\r\nleft on the ground as a mulch and fertilizer. We have never used any\r\nwindbreaks at any of our orchards. Think they would be an advantage in\r\nsome localities. We use traps for rabbits, knife and wire for borers. We\r\nprune very little, such as removing broken limbs. We have never\r\nfertilized any of our orchards. We do not believe it pays to pasture\r\norchards, and do not allow it.\r\n\r\nThe insects that trouble us most are: Canker-worm, tent-caterpillar,\r\nfringed-wing bud moth, handmaid-moth or yellow-necked caterpillar,\r\nroundheaded borer and the tussock-moth caterpillar on our trees; and\r\ncodling-moth, gouger and tree cricket on and in our fruit. We spray\r\nannually, using a horse-power machine, illustrated in former reports of\r\nthe State Horticultural Society, for the leaf-eating insects named,\r\nusing London purple and clear water, sometimes adding lime. We spray\r\nbefore the blossom opens, for bud moth, canker-worm and\r\ntent-caterpillar, and after the petals have fallen for codling-moth,\r\ntussock-moth, and fall web-worm. We have been successful except as to\r\nbud moth and fall web-worm. We believe we have greatly reduced the\r\ncodling-moth by spraying, and we know we have destroyed the canker-worm.\r\nHave never successfully combated borers, excepting with knife and wire.\r\nFall web-worms are burned in the tree with a gasoline torch, or the\r\nsmall limbs with webs are removed and burned. We have as yet found no\r\nparticular method for fighting the bud moth successfully.\r\n\r\nWe gather our apples by hand in common two-bushel seamless sacks, used\r\nin the same manner as for sowing grain. A strap of heavy leather is\r\nattached, making it easy for the shoulder. A hook and ring are also put\r\non to facilitate the removal of the sack when emptying. We prefer common\r\nstraight ladders, with sides from sixteen to twenty inches apart at the\r\nbottom and six inches at the top, rounds fourteen inches apart. We use\r\nbushel boxes for hauling from the orchard to packing-house. We sort into\r\nthree grades: No. 1, No. 2, and culls. No. 1's are all sound and firm\r\napples, of about from two and one-fourth to two and one-half inches in\r\ndiameter, the size of the smallest depending on the variety. We put in\r\nthe No. 2 grade those that have any defects barring them from the first\r\ngrade, yet they make a good second-class for immediate use; we also pack\r\nin this grade any sound apples that run uniformally small.\r\n\r\nOf all packages tried, we prefer and use the three-bushel barrel, 17-1/8\r\ninch head and 28-1/2 inch stave. When one head is removed, the barrel is\r\nturned over and a rap with the hand removes all trash. If we are packing\r\na fine grade of fruit, we put a piece of white paper, cut a little less\r\nthan the diameter of the barrel, in before facing. Barrels are\r\ndouble-faced or plated. We are careful to have the barrels rocked or\r\nshaken often while being filled. The name of variety and our trade-mark\r\nis put on the barrel with stencil or rubber stamp. No. 1's and 2's are\r\nhauled to shipping station in barrels; culls in bulk in ordinary farm\r\nwagon. We have never sold our crop in the orchard; always preferred to\r\nhave it picked and packed under our own supervision. Our apples have\r\nbeen sold in car lots. Firsts and seconds have gone to wholesale\r\ndealers. Culls we have evaporated, sold to men who evaporate, to\r\ncider-mills, and to dealers who handle bulk apples.\r\n\r\nFor drying, we use the New York hop kiln, Rival No. 2 parers, and\r\nupright bleachers, all of which have been reasonably satisfactory. We\r\nbelieve them the best we can get, considering the class of evaporated\r\nfruit in demand. White stock is best handled in fifty-pound boxes;\r\nchops, peelings and cores in sacks. We always found a ready market for\r\ndried fruit. Some years it paid well.\r\n\r\nWe have wintered only in cold-storage plants, always in barrels, and it\r\nhas been profitable. Ben Davis and Winesap have kept best, with Missouri\r\nPippin a close second. Jonathan keeps well under proper conditions. If\r\nkept as late as March, it is generally necessary to repack, but not\r\nalways. Our greatest loss has been on Jonathan, which in some instances,\r\nwhen kept late in the season, has reached ten per cent.\r\n\r\nWe have never irrigated or watered any part of our orchards.\r\n\r\nPrices have ranged as follows with us: For No. 1, from $1.50 to $4; and\r\nNo. 2, 90 cents to $2 per barrel. Culls have brought from 25 cents to 60\r\ncents per 100 pounds; evaporated apples from 4 to 13 cents per pound;\r\nall these free on board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. E. HOUGHTON, Weltbote, Washington county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-nine years; have 100 apple trees, fifteen years old, twelve\r\ninches in diameter. For commercial and family orchards, I prefer Ben\r\nDavis, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, Huntman's Favorite, Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin, Rambo, and Jonathan. Have tried and discarded Dominie, Roman\r\nStem, and Bellflower; the latter on account of shy bearing. Think bottom\r\nland, black, rich loam, and north aspect, the best. I prefer\r\nthree-year-old, short, stout-bodied trees--the shorter the better--with\r\nlimbs as low as they will grow. I cultivate my orchard to corn, potatoes\r\nor vines as long as it is possible to do the work. I use a plow,\r\ncultivator, and one-horse double-shovel plow. I cease cropping when they\r\nbegin to bear, and plant to clover. I consider windbreaks essential;\r\nwould not grow an orchard without one, and would use Osage orange, ash,\r\nRussian mulberry, or box-elder, planted in several rows on south and\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nI wrap my trees with corn-stalks to protect from rabbits, and wash them\r\nwith strong soapsuds, for borers, in May and June. I prune a great deal\r\nto let the sun, light and air in; I think it beneficial and that it\r\npays. I never thin; but think it would be beneficial when the apples are\r\nlarge enough to tell the good ones from the bad. I think it advisable to\r\nuse fertilizers on poor land. I never pasture my orchard under any\r\ncircumstances whatever: do not think it advisable. My trees are bothered\r\nwith borers. Some worm troubles my apples. I do not spray.\r\n\r\nI pick into a sack over the shoulder, as for sowing wheat. I sort into\r\ntwo classes as I pick, to avoid handling again, putting the sound,\r\nhand-picked in one pile and the windfalls in another; cover them with\r\nhay and let them stay out as long as I dare, then put them in the\r\ncellar; but the cellar is too warm; think an outdoor cellar or cave\r\nwould be better; would like to put them in cold storage, which is far\r\nthe best. I sell my apples in the orchard, or any way I can get the most\r\nfor them; generally take them to town and sell them. I sell my second\r\nand third grades at home; feed the culls to the hogs. My best markets\r\nare Washington and Greenleaf. I have never tried distant markets. Never\r\ndry any. I store some apples in boxes, barrels, and bulk; am not very\r\nsuccessful. I find that Winesap and Rawle's Janet keep best. I do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have been from fifty to seventy-five cents per bushel.\r\nThere is not much sale for dried apples. We do most of our own work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEDWIN TAYLOR, Delaware township, Wyandotte county: I have lived in\r\nKansas twenty-seven years. Have about 5000 apple trees aged from eight\r\nto twelve years. The best varieties of apples for commercial orchards\r\nare not many. No one variety could be named which would be best for all\r\nlocations or conditions. The Ben Davis is most largely planted in the\r\nWest. Jonathan, Missouri Pippin, Willow Twig, Park's Keeper, are all\r\nvaluable sorts. There are others. A family orchard is the most important\r\norchard a farmer plants. It should contain a small number of trees and a\r\nlarge number of varieties. Two of a kind are a plenty. There should be\r\nat least twenty kinds. That will allow for a new variety to ripen in its\r\nseason every two weeks or less in summer and fall and every three weeks\r\nduring the winter. They should begin with the earliest and finish with\r\nthe very longest keeper. These varieties will overlap, so that the\r\nfarmer will almost always have two sorts to choose from. There should be\r\nsweet apples among them--particularly winter sweets.\r\n\r\nThe names, characteristics, qualities, description, etc., of the twenty\r\nto thirty varieties that make up an ideal orchard would require a long\r\nchapter, if the subject was fully treated. Beginners in tree buying\r\nshould be cautioned not to let the nurseryman run in half a dozen trees\r\nof each kind for the family orchard on them. Two trees of a kind are\r\nplenty, particularly as the surplus of the family orchard commonly goes\r\nto waste. The names should be carefully registered, so there will be no\r\nwondering what an apple is when it begins to bear. You can't keep\r\ncompany satisfactorily with an apple that you don't know the name of,\r\nany better than you can an unknown man.\r\n\r\nThe best place to keep these family apples is in a dugout, in the side\r\nof a bank if possible, at all events good and deep, with the door at the\r\nnorth, and a good blow-hole in the south end. I don't know much about\r\nsoils or location. I found myself in possession of some Kaw river\r\ntimbered hills, clay soil carrying some sand; not good for much else; so\r\nI planted them--tops, sides, and draws--with apple trees, which have\r\ndone well on the tops of the hills, sides of the hills, and in the\r\nvalleys between the hills. Am inclined to suspect there is a great deal\r\nof gammon written about \"slope\" and \"expanse\" for orchards. My\r\nconclusion is that that is a good slope which you happen to have. Trees\r\ngrowing in the Kaw bottoms themselves, I observe, thrive and bear. The\r\nonly cultivation I have ever given trees has been such as they got by\r\nbeing component parts of a corn-field, except that I have mainly given\r\nthe tree rows extra cultivation, keeping them clean of grass and weeds.\r\nMy orchards are now seeded to clover; clover is not valuable, for its\r\nown sake, among trees, but the trees thrive with it. Its greatest use,\r\nso far as I can see, is to make you mow the orchard where it is twice\r\nduring the season. I prefer to stop cultivation in orchards when they\r\nare six years old.\r\n\r\nI have no knowledge of windbreaks, but I have had a great deal of\r\n\"mechanical destruction\" done by borers and rabbits. Both these pests\r\nare good \"mechanics\" in their way and willing to work. I have the borers\r\nhunted spring and fall. Small trees I have protected from rabbits by\r\nstalks, paper, or veneering. Rabbits are not hard to head off, but they\r\nwon't let a case go by default. Some people depend upon traps, dogs,\r\nguns, poison, cats, washes, wagon grease and liver to keep the rabbits\r\naway. I have known all of these to fail, but I have never known a tree\r\nwell tied up with corn-stalks to suffer from \"mechanical destruction\"\r\nvia the rabbit route, unless the string broke. There is no law against\r\nhaving a good string. The only pruning I have ever done has been to take\r\nout water sprouts. I don't know whether it paid or not. But I like the\r\nlooks of a tree better without the pompadour effect a top full of\r\nsprouts gives it. Never have thinned apples; orchards here are\r\nself-thinners. By picking time the fruit is fully half on the ground and\r\ncommonly not too much on the trees. Have never used manure or any\r\nfertilizer on apple trees. I never pastured an orchard but once. One\r\ntrial cured me. I judge that one trial is nearly always enough. It is\r\nnot advisable to pasture orchards, not even with hogs. The greatest pest\r\nwe have is the apple worm--son, I am told, of the codling-moth. Have\r\nmade no effort to check it by spraying, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nI pick apples by hand; drop them into a sack hung over the shoulder;\r\nwhen the sack is full, it is emptied onto a sorting table. Make two\r\nclasses of fruit: No. 1 and culls. Have never used any package but the\r\nbarrel. Prefer the full-sized flour barrel. Fill barrel full enough to\r\nprevent rattling, when head is pressed in; mark faced head with variety,\r\nquality, and my name and address. Have never sold crop in orchard; often\r\nsell culls there. Have never sold a greater amount than one car-load at\r\none time; have sold as little as one peck. The best market is sometimes\r\nat one place, sometimes at another. Minneapolis is the most distant\r\nmarket I have ever tried. Have mostly put my apples in cold storage.\r\nAbout one time out of three they have kept well. The fault was not in\r\nthe apples; cold storage is either not understood or frequently\r\nmismanaged. Cold-storage people should be made to guarantee their\r\nwork!--should not be paid for apples that are not delivered in the\r\nspring. Cold-storage rates (fifty cents per barrel) are absurdly high. I\r\nuse male help, young and old, good and bad. Help commonly hard to get\r\nhere in the fall. Wages ordinarily one dollar per day, without board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. D. MARTINDALE, Scranton, Osage county: I have been on this place\r\nthirteen years, and since coming here have set every tree now on it.\r\nTrees that I set out in the spring of 1885 measure six to ten inches in\r\ndiameter. In 1895 I put out 350 apple trees; in 1896 I planted 250 more,\r\npart of them were three- and four-year-old, when set. I lost only\r\nthirteen out of the 600. A few of the Missouri Pippins bore fruit last\r\nyear. I consider the following varieties, in the order named, best for\r\ncommercial orchard: Ben Davis, Jonathan, Winesap, Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin; and for family use I would add Maiden's Blush, Cooper's Early\r\nWhite, Missouri Pippin, and Rawle's Janet. I have tried and discarded\r\nSmith's Cider and Lowell, as they blight too much. I prefer bottom land\r\nif it is properly drained, as it is apt to be richer and the trees will\r\nnot suffer as much in a dry season--black loam, with a porous subsoil,\r\nto let the surplus water soak away. I think a northern slope best, as\r\nthe trees do not suffer as much from the sun on hot summer days. Apple\r\ntrees have done best for me on a black loam underlaid with a porous\r\nsubsoil that will take the surplus water and still hold moisture in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nI plant by plowing light furrows (thirty-four feet apart) across the lay\r\nof the ground, then plowing two or four furrows together up and down the\r\nslope thirty-four feet apart, and run a lister in this big furrow,\r\nbreaking up the ground as deeply as possible. I dip the roots of my\r\ntrees in lye water, using one pound carbonate of lye to eight gallons of\r\nwater. Then fill in with a spade around the roots, being careful not to\r\nleave any holes for mice to nest in. Two- or three-year-old trees, with\r\nroots and top well balanced, no forks to split down when the tree gets\r\nolder, bark smooth and good color, I consider best. I prefer piece-root\r\nto whole-root grafts. My experience is that we get better trees on piece\r\nroots, as the union is lower down in the ground and the scion throws out\r\nroots, which makes the trees healthy and not wholly dependent on\r\nseedling roots. I cultivate my orchard till ten or twelve years old, and\r\nkeep all weeds and grass away, using an eight-inch plow with one horse\r\nnext to the trees and backfurrow to every other row; then use two horses\r\nand fourteen-inch plow for the middles. The next year I backfurrow to\r\nthe rows left the year before; in this way we have no large back or dead\r\nfurrows, but keep the ground level. In cultivating I use a\r\nfourteen-tooth Peerless harrow each side of the row, and cultivate the\r\nrest with two-horse cultivator; then use a good sharp hoe close to the\r\ntrees. Corn is the best crop to raise among young trees, as it acts as a\r\nwindbreak and a partial shade. After an orchard gets to bearing, seed to\r\nred clover. I would change from corn to clover eight or nine years after\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nWindbreaks are essential. I would have them on the south and west sides\r\nof the orchard, at least. I would make them of evergreen, Osage orange,\r\nor mulberry. I would not plant black walnut, cottonwood, or maple, as\r\nthey are injurious to apple trees. Plant peach trees between the apple\r\ntrees; they grow fast, and protect the apple until large enough to stand\r\nthe winds. The best thing I have found to keep rabbits, mice, etc., off\r\nthe trees is a protector made of five lath two feet long, woven with\r\nwire; they can be left on summer and winter, as sunlight and air can\r\npass through to the bark and keep it healthy and keep the sun from\r\nscalding the bark; it also keeps the borers and the whippletree from\r\ndoing much damage; they can be left on until the trees outgrow them. I\r\ncut out all limbs that are liable to rub each other at any future time,\r\nand all limbs that are liable to split down as the tree gets older; I\r\nalso trim high enough to let a small horse walk under the limbs. I take\r\noff the back pad while working among the trees, so it will not be\r\ncatching on the limbs; I think that it pays, and is beneficial. I have\r\nnot thinned the fruit while on the trees. My trees are planted in\r\nalternate rows of different kinds, so I cannot tell what is best, blocks\r\nor mixed. I use all the barn-yard litter broadcast that I can get, and\r\nwish I had more. I shall plow under a good crop of red clover about\r\nevery other year, and seed again the same year to clover, as I think it\r\nbeneficial; I would do the same on all lands that I have yet tried. I do\r\nnot let horses or cattle over one year old pasture in the orchard. I let\r\ncalves and small pigs have access to the orchard, as they will eat up a\r\ngreat many wormy apples that drop, and help keep down the weeds. I think\r\nit advisable to pasture with young stock, and that it pays.\r\n\r\nMy apple trees are troubled with canker-worm, twig-borer, and\r\nleaf-crumpler. The codling-moth troubled my apples some last year. I\r\nhave not tried spraying as yet. I have found borers in a few trees that\r\nwere out in the grass near the fence. I pick my apples by hand; using\r\nstep-ladders for the lower limbs, and longer ladders, wide at the bottom\r\nand very narrow at the top, for the upper limbs. While picking in the\r\ninside of a tree, I use a half-bushel sack made to hang on a limb, and\r\nso arranged that it can be let to the ground and emptied without getting\r\nout of the tree. I make three grades of my apples: First, good size,\r\nsmooth, free from worms, and good calyx; second, apples under size, a\r\nlittle specked and wormy; third, culls. I have been sorting from the\r\npile, but think I shall use a table made with the back end the higher,\r\nand the top made of heavy canvas without end, and passing over rollers\r\nat each end, so the apples can be brought in reach without handling\r\nthem; then I would arrange my barrels so that the apples can be placed\r\nin them without bruising. I prefer the three-bushel barrel to ship in;\r\nbut for handling I want a one-bushel box with handholes in the ends. I\r\nwould pack the barrels as tight as possible, and then mark the name of\r\nvariety, grade and name of grower on it. I would ship them by fast\r\nfreight or express.\r\n\r\nSometimes I sell in the orchard. I have generally sold by retail and\r\npeddled, as I have a good set of customers. I can do as well to sell\r\ndirect to the consumer as to sell at wholesale. I sell second grade to\r\nany one that will buy. I feed the culls to cattle and hogs, and let the\r\nhens have all they want. I have had a market near home for all I have\r\ngrown; may have to look further when all my trees bear. I have not tried\r\ndistant markets. What I have tried took all the profits. I do not think\r\nit pays to dry apples, unless on an extensive scale. I store my apples\r\nfor winter market in a dry cellar. I pack in both barrels and boxes\r\nwhile in the cellar; prefer boxes, as they are easier to handle and sort\r\nfrom. I have not been as successful as I would like, but think I have\r\ndone as well as many apple-growers have with the number of trees I have.\r\nThe Ben Davis, Winesap and Janet have kept the best for me. I have not\r\ntried artificial cold storage. If apples are held any length of time, I\r\nrepack, so as to be sure they are up to grade. I do not lose over two\r\nper cent. In the fall apples sold at about thirty cents per bushel, and\r\nthrough the winter fifty to eighty cents per bushel. I employ careful\r\nmen to pick and handle my fruit. I pay from fifteen dollars to eighteen\r\ndollars a month and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nS. REYNOLDS, Lawrence, Douglas county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nforty-three years; have an apple orchard planted from two to forty\r\nyears. I planted my first orchard in 1858, and, not knowing anything\r\nabout what sorts would be suitable for Kansas, I had to rely entirely on\r\nwhat the Missouri nurserymen recommended. Among the sorts planted which\r\nproved failures were Yellow Bellflower, Fulton Strawberry, White Winter\r\nPearmain, Baldwin, the Russets and some others. Winesap, Rawle's Janet,\r\nDominie and White Bellflower all did fairly well. Of all the sorts the\r\nWinesap has been the most profitable. If I had planted that first\r\norchard chiefly to Winesaps, the cash receipts would have been more than\r\ndouble. My later experience and observations prove that the Missouri\r\nPippin is the most profitable apple to grow for the market, the Winesap\r\nand Ben Davis following next in order. For a family orchard, I prefer\r\nEarly Harvest, Maiden's Blush, Jonathan, and Winesap. I prefer second\r\nbottom, with a rich soil and a porous subsoil. I prefer two-year-old,\r\nvigorous trees, set in rows two rods apart. Use a potato hook.\r\n\r\nI consider the best plan of planting is to throw two furrows together,\r\nand plant on this double thickness of surface soil; the roots will\r\nluxuriate in this bed of fertile soil and with proper care the tree will\r\nmake a vigorous growth. Plant early in the spring, before the buds\r\nstart. I cultivate my orchard with a disc harrow followed by a common\r\nharrow, until they begin to bear; plant corn, potatoes or other hoed\r\ncrop in a young orchard. Seed the bearing orchard to clover. Windbreaks\r\nare not essential in eastern Kansas. For rabbits I wrap the young trees;\r\ndig borers out. Pruning should be done at the time of planting. After\r\nthat give the tree all the top it can grow. Never fear but the roots\r\nwill keep pace with the top. Remember that every time you cut out a\r\nlarge limb you threaten the life of the tree. Give the tree plenty of\r\nroom, so that the roots will not overreach each other. The moisture in\r\nthe soil is only sufficient for one set of roots. About two rods apart\r\nis the proper distance. I prune with a knife to keep the limbs from\r\ncrossing. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees, they usually thin\r\nthemselves. My Ben Davis and Missouri Pippins are in mixed planting. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with stable litter; I think it beneficial, and\r\nwould advise its use on all soils after the trees begin to bear. I\r\npasture my orchard in the fall after the fruit is gathered, with horses.\r\nI cannot see any injury. I never let horned cattle in.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with root aphis and roundhead borers. I do not\r\nspray. I find that all apples must be gathered before they are quite\r\nripe if we want them to keep well. In order to have them in the best\r\ncondition for keeping they must be picked without bruises; I hand-pick\r\nmine in a sack over the shoulder. They must be kept perfectly cool and\r\nat an even temperature. This of course can be done by placing them in\r\ncold storage. I sort from a table in the orchard into two classes, large\r\nand medium. Pack in barrels, mark with grade, and haul to market. I sell\r\napples in the orchard, generally wholesale them; sell the best to\r\nshippers. Sell the culls for cider. My best markets are west and north.\r\nI have tried distant markets, through agents, and found it paid. I do\r\nnot dry any apples, but sell many low-grade apples to the evaporating\r\nfactory. Do not store any; sell in the fall to shippers. Do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have been from one dollar per barrel up. Dried apples\r\nfrom four to six cents per pound. I employ young men at one dollar per\r\nday. The profits from a good apple orchard are more than those from any\r\nother crop which requires no more labor and expense. The profits from\r\none good crop of apples are more than from three crops of wheat or corn;\r\nbut apple-growing, as well as the growing of all other kinds of fruit,\r\nrequires constant, patient labor and attention, in order to be\r\nsuccessful, and even then the money will not come in with a great rush.\r\nIn conclusion, I would say, that the business of growing fruit is much\r\nmore certain of success than that of mercantile business. It has been\r\nascertained from actual statistics that, of every 100 merchants, fifty\r\nutterly fail in business, forty are only moderately successful, and of\r\nthe remaining ten only one will become rich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW. J. GRIFFING, Manhattan, Kan.: Were that old fisherman, Izaak Walton,\r\nalive to-day, and an enthusiastic fruit-grower of eastern Kansas, he\r\nwould probably express himself in the book he would write, \"The Complete\r\nHorticulturist,\" that \"doubtless God might have made a better apple\r\ncountry than this, but doubtless He never did.\" If there is a strip of\r\nland in the United States equal in size to the eastern third of Kansas\r\nable to grow as many and as fine apples as this particular strip, it has\r\nyet to be discovered. Our own experience in this line dates back just\r\nforty years. In 1858 the old family account-book shows the purchase by\r\nmy father of three dollars' worth of apple trees (the number not given).\r\nThis amount judiciously expended now would secure considerable nursery\r\nstock; but the same record shows the purchase, the month previous, of\r\nwheat at two dollars per bushel; sugar, six pounds for one dollar;\r\nflour, five dollars per hundredweight; so the number of trees obtained\r\nwas probably not large. The following year, however (1859), seventy-one\r\napple trees and some cherry trees were purchased, at a cost of $17.75.\r\nThese efforts to start an orchard were successful. The location was on\r\nthe old homestead, about two and one-half miles east of what was at that\r\ntime a frontier village called Topeka. The trees bore the first fruit in\r\n1867. Other and more profitable orchards have been planted since then on\r\nthe farm, but a few of the original plantation are still standing and\r\nbearing occasional crops of fruit (so my brother informs me).\r\n\r\nOn locating at Manhattan in 1870, the sod was broken, and the following\r\nyear an orchard was planted; and we have planted trees more or less\r\nevery year since. It has proven a source of pleasure and profit. After\r\nit commenced bearing I do not recall a year when the crop was an entire\r\nfailure, and though we cannot now command two dollars per bushel, as we\r\ncould for the apples from the Topeka orchard, yet they have paid well.\r\nThe number of varieties we have tried is no less than seventy-five, not\r\nincluding seedlings. The following varieties I would unhesitatingly\r\nrecommend as having proved profitable and more or less hardy. For early\r\nsummer, Early Harvest and Red Astrachan; both are tender apples when\r\nfully ripe and will then not bear shipping well. I have found it best\r\nto gather the ripest at least every other day and find buyers in the\r\nlocal market. The next to follow these, Chenango Strawberry, Maiden's\r\nBlush, and Pennsylvania Red Streak; the two latter are good shippers.\r\nThe Pennsylvania Red Streaks are a decided success with me, and have\r\npaid nearly as well as my best winter sorts; don't fail to plant some of\r\nthem. Next, I would recommend the following winter varieties in the\r\norder named: Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, Jonathan, and if you\r\nlike a first-class sweet apple plant some Bentley Sweet, if you can\r\nobtain them. I have been obliged to top-graft some seedlings in order to\r\nperpetuate my own stock of them. I think it is also advisable to plant\r\nsome Rawle's Janet trees. They are a late bloomer and will occasionally\r\nproduce a crop when the other sorts have been injured by late freezing.\r\nIn fact, they have the faculty of bearing in the \"off\" years, as we call\r\nthem--years when the balance of the orchard is resting from previous\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said as to the proper location for an orchard--bottom land\r\nor hilltop, level ground or sloping. The fact is, with careful attention\r\nto the trees, any good, rich soil will answer. Anything that can in a\r\nmeasure ward off the evil effects of the fierce summer gales and the\r\ndroughts of July, August and September will tend to minimize the losses.\r\nWere it possible for me to choose a piece of land exactly to my notions,\r\nI should select a river-bottom farm in the neck of some large\r\n\"horseshoe,\" being where it would be possible for the trees to reach\r\ndown their roots and draw moisture during the dry season by natural\r\nsubirrigation. Marketing the crop is the last but not the least work of\r\nthe apple-grower. In fact, when the orchard is well established, this is\r\nabout the only work connected with the orchard. And in that respect the\r\norchard has a decided advantage over other farm crops, that require\r\nyearly preparation of the soil, sowing, harrowing, cultivating, etc., as\r\nwell as the harvesting of the crop. The early summer apples can usually\r\nbe sold on the local market at fair prices; the later summer and fall\r\ncan be shipped, and are usually in fair demand by Western buyers. Ship\r\nonly your best; it will hardly pay to send any other grade. There is\r\nusually a good demand at this point for winter varieties by farmers from\r\nthe West, who come in and buy their winter supply by the wagon-load.\r\nOccasionally, if the Eastern crop is short, buyers from Chicago will be\r\non the ground. We do not believe in holding apples long in the hope of\r\nobtaining higher prices. Cold storage will solve this difficulty of the\r\norchardist; we hope it will prove a success.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient thing to gather apples in from a tree or ladder that\r\nwe have tried is a picking sack--a grain sack with a heavy wire or a\r\nstiff leather strap fastened around the mouth, and a broad strap\r\nconnecting the top with the bottom of the sack. This can be carried over\r\nthe shoulder with considerable comfort. There are always more or less\r\ninferior and unmarketable apples left after the best have been disposed\r\nof, and what to do with them is a question that confronts every great\r\napple grower. For the last fourteen years we have been working this\r\ngrade into vinegar. We found there was considerable to learn and care\r\nexercised to avoid losses. I will mention a few important things that\r\nare necessary to produce a good article of cider vinegar. First obtain\r\ngood, iron-bound oak barrels--vinegar or whisky barrels preferred. Never\r\nuse soft wood barrels of any kind. Paint them well with ocher before\r\nusing; they will last longer. After filling with cider, keep in a shed\r\nuntil cool weather; then draw off and run into barrels in the cellar for\r\nwinter, although, if well protected and not too full, they could remain\r\nout in the shed over winter. In the spring draw off again and run into\r\nother barrels; you will, in this, hasten the fermentation of vinegar and\r\nobtain an article free from sediment. It requires from one to two years\r\nfor vinegar to cease working. Sell it then, and not before. Though it\r\nmay be very strong, it will not keep pickles unless the process is\r\ncomplete. Much of the vinegar sold on the markets as apple vinegar is\r\nmade from corn, and now that corn has risen in price it is possible that\r\nthe price of this kind of vinegar may rise also. It has not the quality\r\nor flavor of cider vinegar, but it can be manufactured so cheaply that\r\nit has hurt the market for a better article.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaj. FRANK HOLSINGER, Rosedale, Wyandotte county: Has resided in Kansas\r\nsince March 7, 1867--thirty years; has 1500 apple trees from one to\r\ntwenty-nine years planted, \"big as a barn.\" Prefers Gano, Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin and York Imperial for commercial purposes, and Early\r\nHarvest, Cooper's Early White, Maiden's Blush and Jonathan added for\r\nfamily use. Says life is too short to tell how many varieties he has\r\ntried and discarded. Prefers a loose soil, and used to think hilltop\r\nbest, but says there is no choice between bottom and hilltop, and that\r\nany particular slope is a delusion, as all are equal. Plants medium\r\ntwo-year-old trees, \"usually roots downward--tops up.\" Cultivates with\r\ndouble-shovel plow and hoe up to seven years, planting with corn or\r\npotatoes. Then grows clover and weeds, \"weeds mostly,\" ceasing to\r\ncultivate when it becomes inconvenient. Says windbreaks are unnecessary,\r\nand should only be made of the sun--\"let her shine\"--and does not\r\nunderstand how a rabbit can do a _mechanical_ job of gnawing. Does not\r\nprune; he \"trains\"; leaves the pruning tools in the tool-house, and says\r\nit pays. Would thin apples on trees if labor did not come so high. His\r\nexperience as to difference in fruitfulness between planting of one or\r\nof several kinds [together] is unsatisfactory. Believes fertilizers are\r\ngood for trees if spread out, never if piled around the tree; would\r\nsurely advise its use on all orchards. Would never allow an orchard\r\npastured by any kind of live stock.\r\n\r\nHas a large list of insects to contend against, but is not bothered with\r\nleaf eaters, hence does not spray, and does not believe any one has\r\nlessened the codling-moth by spraying. Uses common sense on borers, and\r\ndigs them out. He first mounds the tree, and thereby gets what larvae\r\nthere may be deposited high up in the collar, few remain; these I dig\r\nout, which is all \"simple enough.\" He describes gathering apples thus:\r\n\"Pick 'em by hand; surround the apple with your fingers, break back\r\ngently, which loosens the stem, then lay gently in the basket. It is\r\nvery simple, the process.\" Makes two classes, one the best, the other of\r\nseconds. In the first we put all that seem perfect; in the second, all\r\nothers that are not culls. Packs in barrels, well shaken down and\r\npressed; marks with name of variety, and always rolls [?] them to\r\nmarket. Sells the best any way possible, peddles seconds, and lets the\r\nculls rot. His best market is Kansas City--three miles. Never dries any.\r\nStores for winter in various ways. Has had varying success, and believes\r\nloss in cold store was owing to varying temperature and lack of proper\r\ncare. Does not irrigate, but trusts in the Lord. Prices range from six\r\ndollars to ten dollars per barrel. For help he uses \"men and mules,\" and\r\npays as \"little as possible, believing that is often too much.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN E. SAMPLE, Beman, Morris county: Have been in Kansas twenty years;\r\nhave 1000 trees planted twelve years, of Ben Davis, Rawle's Janet,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Winesap; also Red and Sweet June, Early Harvest,\r\nand Maiden's Blush. Have discarded the Twenty-ounce Pippin as no good\r\nhere. I have a deep, black loam with a clay subsoil, on upland, with\r\nsoutheast slope. I plant two-year-old trees a little deeper than they\r\ngrow in the nursery, in rows thirty feet apart, and thirty feet in the\r\nrows, alternating the trees. I cultivate to corn and potatoes for about\r\neight years, and then sow to red clover. I believe windbreaks\r\nbeneficial, and would make them of red cedar or Russian apricots planted\r\non the west, south and east sides, thirty feet from the orchard. I feed\r\nthe rabbits corn and clover; have no trouble with borers. I prune\r\nheavily, to make the apples large and keep down too much wood growth. I\r\nfertilize my trees with timber dirt, and think it pays. I believe it\r\npays and is advisable to pasture orchards with hogs. I pick by hand, and\r\nsort into three classes: large, medium, small and blemished. Have not\r\ndried any. Store in the cellar, in crates two feet long, ten inches\r\nwide, and eight inches deep. Have sold at fifty to eighty cents per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. K. WOLVERTON, Barnes, Washington county: I have resided in Kansas\r\ntwenty-eight years; have an apple orchard of 18,500 trees from five to\r\ntwenty-seven years old. For market I prefer Missouri Pippin and Ben\r\nDavis, and for family orchard would add Duchess of Oldenburg. Have tried\r\nand discarded Winesap and Rawle's Janet on account of shy bearing and\r\npoor keeping quality. I prefer a rich bottom with a porous subsoil, an\r\neast and north slope. I prefer good, thrifty, two-year-old trees. I\r\nplant by wire after the principle of check-row corn-planting; make the\r\nlinks twenty feet long, tie a white cloth in each link coupling, make\r\nthe line long enough to plant ten trees (eleven links in length),\r\nstretch the chain east and west, say on north side of plat intended for\r\nplanting; stick a stake at every tag. Draw another line ten trees south\r\nof it, and stick a stake at every tag, and so on to the south side of\r\nthe plat. Then draw the line from the northeast stake to the east stake\r\nof the second row, the one due south, having the north tag at the stake.\r\nThen plant at every tag, placing the tree on east side of wire. When the\r\nrow is planted move the wire west to the next stake, and so on till you\r\nreach the west side. The ground should first be prepared by plowing as\r\nfor corn; float off [?] every evening all that you have plowed that day,\r\nwhich leaves the ground in the best condition.\r\n\r\nI cultivate my orchard to corn for six to eight years. I plant twenty\r\nfeet each way, and take an oak plant sixteen feet long, and place one\r\nsection of a disc at each end of it, making it cut sixteen feet wide\r\nfrom outside to outside, and running within two feet of the trees at\r\neither end, leaving a space eight feet wide in the middle. Run another\r\ndisc on that ground with another team and you have the space between the\r\nrows all clean of weeds if ground is in good condition when work is\r\ndone. Cultivate both ways as often as necessary. I grow no crop in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are not essential. For rabbits I tie coarse\r\ngrass around the trees with label wire, and leave it on two years. I\r\nalso use traps. I do not prune my trees; it is too injurious to the\r\ntrees. I do not thin my apples while on the trees; it is too expensive.\r\nMy trees are planted in blocks. I fertilize my orchard with stable\r\nlitter; think it beneficial and would advise its use on all soils. I do\r\nnot pasture my orchard. My apples are troubled with worms. I spray the\r\nfirst of May with London purple for canker and apple worms.\r\n\r\nI pick in baskets and sacks. Sort into two classes: marketable and\r\nculls, using a sorting table. Sell my apples in the orchard to wagons\r\nfrom the West. I evaporate the second- and third-grade apples when the\r\ncrop is large; make the culls into cider and vinegar. I tried distant\r\nmarkets for two years and found they paid. When apples are abundant we\r\ndry for market; use the same kind of driers as are used at Fairmount;\r\nsell them in sacks to the stores, and find a ready market for them; but\r\nit does not always pay. I do not store any for winter market if I can\r\nsell them in the fall. I do not irrigate. Prices have been in 1896,\r\ntwenty-five cents per bushel; 1897, forty cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. A. HEWITT, Hiawatha, Brown county: I have lived in Kansas thirty\r\nyears, and have an orchard of 900 trees twenty-six years old. For\r\ncommercial purposes I prefer the Ben Davis, Winesap, and Jonathan; and\r\nfor family use would add Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, and Grimes's\r\nGolden. Have tried and discarded some; very few varieties pay. I prefer\r\nhigh prairie. Have never grown any seedlings. I cultivate my orchard by\r\nplanting to corn--raising no small grain--for a few years, then use the\r\ndisc and harrow as long as the orchard lasts. I plant nothing in the\r\nbearing orchard, and cease cropping about eight years after setting.\r\nWindbreaks are essential to a growing orchard. I prune my trees a little\r\nevery year to keep them in shape, and to let the sun in; I think it\r\nbeneficial, and that it pays. Do not thin the fruit while on the trees,\r\nbut think it would save time and pay well. I can see no difference\r\nwhether trees are in blocks [of one kind] or mixed plantings. I do not\r\nfertilize my orchard, but am sure it would be beneficial, judging by\r\nsome that have fertilized; I would advise it on all soils. No! no! no!\r\nno! I do not pasture my orchard; do not think it advisable; it does not\r\npay. My apples are troubled with codling-moth. I do not spray. I sell my\r\napples in the orchard at wholesale, yet sometimes retail them. I let my\r\nneighbors pick up the culls at ten cents per bushel. My best market is\r\nat home. I store apples successfully in bushel crates. I find the\r\nWinesap, Rawle's Janet, Ben Davis and Little Romanite keep best. I have\r\nto repack stored apples before marketing, losing about two per cent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES DUNLAP, Detroit, Dickinson county: Has lived in Kansas since\r\nOctober, 1871. Has an orchard of 1200 apple trees, 300 planted sixteen\r\nyears, 700 planted eleven years, 200 planted six years. Considers\r\nMissouri Pippin, Winesap, Ben Davis and Jonathan best for market, and\r\nfor family would add Red June, Early Harvest, Mammoth Black Twig, and\r\nCooper's Early White. Have tried and discarded Yellow Transparent,\r\nRambo, Fameuse, and others. Prefers bottom and eastern slope, sandy\r\nloam, with clay subsoil. Plants thrifty one-year-old trees in holes\r\nlarge enough to spread the roots out well, leaning the young trees\r\nslightly to the southwest. Cultivates both ways as close to the trees as\r\npossible, usually planting to corn until the orchard is about twelve\r\nyears old; then pastures to calves in fore part of season, mowing off\r\nthe grass and weeds later. Believes windbreaks very essential on north,\r\nwest and south sides; uses Osage orange hedge and two rows of\r\nforest-trees, planting them seven feet apart and seven feet away from\r\nthe apple trees, when orchard is started.\r\n\r\nFor protection from rabbits he uses a wash of lye and soft soap on the\r\ntree. In pruning he believes it pays to cut out sap sprouts, and balance\r\nup the tree. He fertilizes by placing stable litter around the trees in\r\nwinter, and spreading it in the spring, and says it pays. Says it\r\ncertainly pays and does no harm to pasture the old orchards with calves.\r\nHe is troubled with canker-worm, flathead borer, tarnish plant-bug, fall\r\nweb-worm, and leaf-crumpler, also with codling-moth. He sometimes sprays\r\nfor codling-moth and canker-worm, and thinks he has reduced both of them\r\nmaterially. Cuts out borers and washes the tree with lye. Has tried\r\nkerosene oil on borers and says it did not seem to injure the trees. He\r\npicks in baskets, dumps in piles in the orchard, and covers with coarse\r\nhay. Sorts into two classes--sellers and cider apples. Uses barrels as a\r\npackage. Makes cider vinegar and hog feed of culls, and sells his good\r\napples in various ways; has sold in orchard. His best markets are the\r\nsurrounding towns and the neighboring farmers. Never dries any, and only\r\nstores enough for winter use of family. Price in 1896 was seventy-five\r\ncents for best, fifty cents for seconds.

I\r\nhave 4000 apple trees that have been set from twenty to thirty years. My\r\nmarket varieties are Ben Davis, Jonathan, and Missouri Pippin. For\r\nfamily use I added Yellow Transparent, Red June, Chenango Strawberry,\r\nWhite Winter Pearmain, Rawle's Janet, and Nelson's Sweet. I have\r\ndiscarded the Baldwin, Spitzenberg, Northern Spy, Early Harvest, and\r\nEarly Pennock. Bottom land is not good; hills and hollows are best, with\r\nnorth or east slope; what we call mulatto soil is best. I prefer thrifty\r\ntwo- or three-year-old trees with low tops. Half of my trees are planted\r\nthirty feet each way. I now plant in rows two rods apart north and south\r\nand one rod apart in the row. I raise corn and potatoes among my trees\r\nfor five or seven years, cultivating with the plow and the hoe;\r\nafterward I seed to clover; a disc can be used to good advantage every\r\nyear; I keep the orchard in clover. Windbreaks are beneficial on high\r\nland, made of cottonwood, or better of cedar or Norway spruce, planted\r\non the south side when you plant the orchard. I protect from rabbits\r\nwith wooden protectors, leaving them on the year round. I cut the borers\r\nout with a knife, also use a wire. I shape the head of young trees by\r\ncutting out all the watersprouts with pruning shears and saw; old trees\r\nmust be pruned or the apples will be small.\r\n\r\nBarn-yard litter is beneficial on thin land, not necessary on rich land,\r\nbut ashes are good on any soil. I pasture my orchard in summer with\r\nyoung horses and hogs. I think it advisable, as the hogs eat the apples\r\nthat drop and destroy the worms. I have never sprayed. I pick in\r\nhalf-bushel baskets, and sacks with an iron hoop in the mouth; pour them\r\nin barrels and haul them to the barn, except those we wish to ship at\r\nonce, which we sort in the orchard. I make two classes--good, sound,\r\nmerchantable apples, and seconds. I have a culler that holds one barrel.\r\nI sort into a barrel, throwing the culls into another barrel, and I\r\nafterward sort the culls, for seconds; I pack in eleven-peck barrels,\r\nfull and pressed solid, marked with the name of the variety written on\r\nthe barrel. I sell the best at wholesale in barrels, the second grade by\r\ncar-loads in bulk; the culls I give away, feed to hogs and cows, and\r\nmake into cider. My best market is East and North. Have never shipped\r\nmore than 500 or 600 miles away, and it paid. Have never dried any, and\r\nonly store in barrels in my barn until I get a sale for them, never\r\nlater than December. Price in the orchards in 1896 was seventy-five\r\ncents per barrel; in 1897, one dollar and a half. I use men for picking,\r\nat one dollar per day and their dinner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF. W.

For family orchard: Winesap, Ben\r\nDavis, Jonathan, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Maiden's Blush, and Rawle's\r\nJanet. Has tried and discarded Yellow Transparent, Early Harvest, Red\r\nJune, Wagener, Willow Twig, Dominie, Roman Stem, Seek-no-further,\r\nPorter, Pound Sweet, Nyack Pippin, and Minkler, because they did not\r\npay; some blighted and failed to bear. Prefer timber soil, or sandy loam\r\nwith open clay subsoil; bottom land is good if it has not a hard-pan\r\nsubsoil. Apples will not succeed well planted on ordinary sod, with\r\nimpervious subsoil. Plant thrifty two-year-old trees, from four to six\r\nfeet high, well branched. Cultivate as long as the tree lives; use\r\nturning plow in spring, and follow with harrow every week during summer\r\nuntil orchard comes into bearing; then get some tool that will stir the\r\nground two to three inches deep, and cultivate often. Cultivation pays\r\nbetter than fertilizer or anything else. He grows small fruit among the\r\ntrees, but believes corn the best crop up to eight or nine years; then\r\ngrows nothing. Does not think windbreaks essential, and would have none\r\non the east or north; would not object to windbreak of Russian mulberry,\r\nor other hardy trees, on south and west. For rabbits, he wraps the\r\ntrees, and keeps two good beagle hounds. Does not prune, except to keep\r\nwatersprouts off, and cuts out limbs that cross. Thinks the wind thins\r\nthe fruit sufficiently. Believes the best apples are self-pollenizers,\r\nand need no other varieties near, and that it does not pay to grow\r\nothers. Never use any fertilizer. If orchard \"runs out,\" would have\r\nanother ready to take its place. Allows no stock in orchard. Is not\r\ntroubled with insects. Has sprayed a little for tent-caterpillar. He\r\ndigs out borers with a knife. His best market has been at home, selling\r\nby the bushel or wagon-load to farmers who do not grow any. Believes\r\nthorough cultivation better than irrigation. Prevailing prices,\r\nthirty-five to seventy-five cents per bushel. Uses male help, at one\r\ndollar per day without board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nS. H. DOMONEY, Aurora, Cloud county: Have been in Kansas ten years. Have\r\nan orchard of ---- trees, planted from twelve to fourteen years, of Ben\r\nDavis, Winesap and Missouri Pippin for market, and Red June, Duchess of\r\nOldenburg, Cooper's Early White and Kansas Keeper for family use. I\r\nprefer limestone soil with gravelly subsoil, in the bottom, with north\r\nslope, if possible. Prefer trees two years old with low heads. \"I like a\r\ntree with a tap-root.\" Plow deeply and plant in loose soil, thirty feet\r\napart each way. I grow potatoes and sweet corn for six or seven years,\r\nafter which I sow orchard-grass. The best tool for cultivating is a disc\r\nharrow. Growing no crop in the orchard. I think windbreaks are\r\nessential, and prefer Russian mulberry, three rows, planted six by eight\r\nfeet apart. I like the mulberry best because they come into leaf early\r\nand hold their foliage late. I prune a little, to thin out and let the\r\nsun in. I believe it would pay to thin fruit on the trees. I use stable\r\nlitter, and fertilizer from the hog-pen, and think it pays if not put\r\ntoo close to the tree. I tried pasturing with hogs, but don't think it\r\nadvisable, as they destroy the trees to get apples. I spray some with\r\nLondon purple after the bloom falls, to destroy canker-worm and\r\ncodling-moth, and think I have reduced the latter by such spraying. I\r\ndig borers out. We pick by hand, and sort into very best, second best,\r\nand culls. I sell at retail and to the grocers in Concordia, Kan. I make\r\nsome cider, and feed culls to the hogs; never dried any; winter some in\r\nbarrels and boxes, and find Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin the best\r\nkeepers. I do not irrigate. Use no hired help. Prices have ranged from\r\nfifty cents in summer to eighty cents in winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. L. FERRIS, Osage City, Osage county: A citizen of Kansas for\r\ntwenty-one years. Have an orchard of 4000 apple trees--200 twenty years,\r\n1800 seventeen years, 2000 sixteen years planted. Prefer, for commercial\r\npurposes, Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin; for family orchard:\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan, Romanite, and Maiden Blush; have\r\ndiscarded Rawle's Janet. Prefer good upland corn ground, with sand or\r\ngravel subsoil, north and east slope. I plow deep, and plant large\r\ntwo-year-old trees, shallow, and mound up; shorten roots and branches.\r\nCultivate with plow and harrow from youth to old age. Grow corn in young\r\norchard up to six years, afterward nothing. Prefer a windbreak on south,\r\nwest, and north, of box-elders, Osage orange, or peach. Rub liver on\r\ntrees to repel rabbits, and use a knife for borers. To prune with a\r\nlittle saw makes the trees grow faster, and the apples grow larger, and\r\nit pays. Use stable and barn-yard litter to fertilize with, and it\r\npays. Would not allow live stock to run in orchard. Am troubled with\r\nroundheaded borers and codling-moth. Spray in May and June for bitter\r\nrot and fungous diseases. Fight borers with a five-eighths chisel, a\r\nwire, and coal-tar. Pick from step-ladders into tin pails hung to branch\r\nwith wire hook; haul in boxes on spring wagon to packing place. Sort on\r\ntables into three grades--first, second, and cider apples; pack into\r\neleven- or twelve-peck barrels. Sell in all ways; have sold in orchard.\r\nShip the best; best market in Texas. Send six-inch apples to where they\r\nare scarce; culls I sell cheaply at home, evaporate some, and make\r\nvinegar. Use a Zimmerman evaporator and Eureka parers. Sell dried fruit\r\nat retail, have shipped some; do not think it pays, do not find a ready\r\nmarket. Store for winter use in boxes in cellar successfully; find\r\nRomanite and Winesap keep best; lose about one-fourth. Have irrigated\r\nsome from a pond with an eight-inch hose and steam-power pump. Average\r\nprice has been fifty cents per bushel for apples and five cents a pound\r\nfor dried apples. Use male help gathering, and female help at dryer,\r\npaying eight to ten cents per hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. OBERNDORF, Centralia, Nemaha county: Have lived in Kansas nineteen\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 4200 trees, from three to twenty years\r\nplanted. I am told Ben Davis and Gano are the best apples for commercial\r\npurposes; for family use I would prefer Early Harvest, Red Astrachan,\r\nDuchess of Oldenburg, Maiden's Blush, Ben Davis, Winesap, and Rawle's\r\nJanet. I prefer hilltop with northern slope. I prefer one-year-old,\r\nswitch-like trees, set 16x30 feet. I plant young orchards to corn, using\r\ndouble-shovel and diamond plow, and harrow; plant the bearing orchard to\r\nclover and cease cropping at five years. For rabbits I use paint during\r\nsummer and wrap during winter. I also use paint for borers. I prune with\r\nshears and knife to secure an open center; do not think it beneficial.\r\nNever thin apples. I fertilize with barn-yard litter; it seems to\r\nbenefit the trees and prolong their fruitfulness. Do not pasture my\r\norchard. My old trees are affected with flathead borer and leaf-roller.\r\nThe codling-moth trouble my apples. I sprayed three seasons; saw no\r\nbenefit, so quit. I pick by hand, in a basket. I sort into three\r\nclasses: First class, for market; second class, for immediate sale, and\r\nsmall ones, for cider. I usually sell at the nearest market. Best market\r\nis at home. Never dry any. I store for winter markets in cellar, in\r\nbarrels, boxes, and in bulk, and am successful; find that the Winesap\r\nand Rawle's Janet keep best. We have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing; sometimes lose more than at other times. Do not irrigate.\r\nPrice has been fifty cents per bushel. I hire help at one dollar per\r\nday, or twenty dollars per month and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. M. HOWARD, Clyde, Cloud county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 450 trees. For market purposes I prefer\r\nBen Davis, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Rawle's Janet, and Jonathan; and\r\nfor family orchard Ben Davis, Winesap, Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush,\r\nJonathan, and Wealthy. Would prefer a deep loam soil, clay subsoil, if\r\nnot too close to the top, and almost level. I prefer two-year-old,\r\nlow-head trees with no forks, planted in furrows. I cultivate my orchard\r\nto corn planted east and west as long as I can, using the plow and\r\ncultivator shallow; and cease cropping when the trees so shade the crop\r\nthat there is no profit; I grow clover or weeds in a bearing orchard,\r\nand mow and leave on the ground for a mulch. Windbreaks are essential; I\r\nwould make them of Osage orange planted in rows 2x4 or 2x6 feet. For\r\nrabbits I wrap the trees with corn-stalks, and for borers I mulch and\r\nkeep the trees growing. I prune my trees when planted; I think it\r\nbeneficial. I never thin the fruit on the trees. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith anything of a coarse nature that is not easily disturbed; I would\r\nadvise its use on all soils, unless very rich, deep clay soil; in such\r\nsoil perhaps clean cultivation would be all that is necessary. I would\r\nadd that my observations and experiences have taught me that the people\r\nof Kansas have lost millions of dollars from and through lack of knowing\r\nwhat we should have known. I think that the State Horticultural Society\r\nis doing a great and good work with _limited_ appropriations. I have\r\nnever seen any one yet who read the reports from the horticultural\r\ndepartment but what was in full sympathy with your labors, but wondered\r\nwhy more reports were not sent out. I think our legislators should be\r\nmore wise; consequently, more liberal in their appropriations for the\r\nwork and distribution of the same, not only to the farmers, but to\r\npeople in towns and cities; their needs are in proportion as great as\r\nthe farmers'.\r\n\r\nAs to the fruit business: On the southeast quarter of section 26,\r\ntownship 4, range 1, is one of the _best_ orchards I know of in Republic\r\ncounty (not the largest). It consists of about 450 apple trees, also\r\npeaches, cherries, pears, and grapes. Myself, little girls and wife\r\nplanted it. I wish to tell you how every one of the different fruits\r\nhave abundantly paid for labor and all cost, and left their owners a\r\nfair profit. The soil of this successful orchard is a black loam, upland\r\nprairie, clay subsoil; loam eighteen inches to two feet deep, previously\r\ncultivated in corn and potatoes, plowed, not listed. Lay of land: Two\r\nslight ridges; a wide draw; slope east and west. Trees more vigorous and\r\nbear as well in draw as on upland. Varieties: Ben Davis, Missouri\r\nPippin, Jonathan, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, Maiden's Blush, mostly the\r\nfirst four. Planting: Distance, thirty by thirty feet, furrowed out with\r\na fourteen-inch plow, running two furrows across each way. Cleaned out\r\nall loose dirt to make room for all roots to spread without turning up.\r\nThe little girls held the trees, tops leaning to the southwest about\r\nfive degrees. I covered the roots well, tramped firmly, and filled with\r\nloose earth. Leave furrows so as to hold water on upper side of tree.\r\nAfter all trees were out I gave each one a slight mulch of sorghum\r\nrefuse. Cultivation: Crop always corn; rows running east and west. Rows\r\nfar enough from trees so horses or singletrees would not touch them.\r\nCultivate shallow, with one horse, and light plow with very short\r\nsingletree. Pruned some. All limbs where cut off were painted. Cut close\r\nand smooth; wounds healed readily. Tried to prune so that air and sun\r\nwould go through and not against the trees. Pinch off all water or\r\ntender sprouts.\r\n\r\nTo protect from rabbits and borers I stand corn-stalks running clear up\r\nto branches around body; tie at top and bottom; keep trees low, a little\r\nheavier on southwest side. I believe with thorough cultivation and stalk\r\nprotection we would hear of less borers. All mulch was kept away from\r\nbodies of trees. I believe it all nonsense not to prune, but it should\r\nbe done while they are young. My observation has been all my life that a\r\nwell-balanced tree is longer lived, has more bushels of fruit, of better\r\nquality, smoother limbs and trunks. So I would say if you do not intend\r\nto protect the bodies of your young trees and prune do not buy or plant\r\nthem; it does not do to sow oats, wheat, rye, millet or any grain crops\r\nin your orchard. It is an easy way to keep weeds down and a sure way to\r\nkill your orchard. It does not pay to pasture even with calves; chickens\r\nare at all times beneficial; hogs after your orchard has matured so the\r\ntrees can resist the hog, when he rubs against them, which the hog is\r\nsure to do, and perhaps he will pull some of the lower limbs. I have\r\nnever sprayed, but firmly believe it profitable. Next year I expect to\r\nplant out a new orchard and cultivate along the line of the one I have\r\ntold about, with such help as I can get from the horticultural\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD. S. HAINES, Edwardsville, Wyandotte county: Has been in Kansas\r\ntwenty-six years; has 3000 apple trees from two to twenty-five years\r\nold. Commercial varieties, Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan, and\r\nWillow Twig; and for family use, Early Harvest, Red Astrachan, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Jonathan, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Rawle's Janet, Celestia, and\r\nWinesap. Has tried and discarded Bellflower, Pennock, Baldwin, McAfee's\r\nNonesuch and others for barrenness. Best location, hilltop, sandy loam\r\nwith clay subsoil--any slope will do. Plants either in fall or spring,\r\ntwo-year-old thrifty trees, fifteen by thirty feet apart, a little\r\ndeeper than they stood in the nursery. Grows corn, potatoes, cabbage,\r\netc., well cultivated, among the trees, but not to crowd them, for five\r\nor six years. Uses a spading harrow where no crop is grown. After six\r\nyears sows to clover. Needs no windbreaks in his section. Traps and\r\nshoots rabbits. Takes borers out with knife. Prunes very little; cuts\r\nout dead or broken limbs, as they are no good, and take up room. Never\r\nhas thinned apples on the trees, but believes it would be all right.\r\nSees no difference in fruitfulness if trees are in blocks of a kind or\r\nmixed up. Would use barn-yard litter, but not close to the trees;\r\nbelieves in it on all soils. Does not pasture, and thinks it would not\r\npay. Is troubled with borers, tent-caterpillars, leaf-rollers,\r\nleaf-crumblers, and codling-moths. Never sprays. Picks in sacks. Packs\r\nin orchard, in twelve-peck barrels well pressed. Uses table for sorting\r\n(described elsewhere) and makes Nos. 1, 2 and 3 grades. Marks name of\r\nvariety and own name on barrel head. Sells his best in car lots at\r\nwholesale, the culls to peddlers. Generally markets at Kansas City. Has\r\ntried distant markets and made it pay. Never dried any. Stores for\r\nwinter in barrels in cold store; not always satisfactory; thinks the\r\ncold-storage business not yet fully understood; says Ben Davis and\r\nJonathan keep best. Sometimes repacks, at a loss of one-tenth to\r\none-sixth. Does not irrigate. Prices have ranged from two to five\r\ndollars per barrel. Paid last year one dollar per day to men who could\r\ndo a good day's work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. M. GRAY, Perry, Jefferson county: I have lived in Kansas forty years;\r\nmy orchard of twenty acres has been planted twenty years. For market, I\r\nprefer Ben Davis and Jonathan on poor land; and Missouri Pippin and\r\nWinesap on rich land. For family orchard, Early Harvest, Red June,\r\nWinesap, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Missouri Pippin, and Huntsman's\r\nFavorite. Have tried and discarded Grimes's Golden Pippin, Lawver,\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, and Huntsman's Favorite; they are not\r\nprofitable, are too small when grown on poor land. I prefer yellow clay\r\nbottom, with an east, south or northern aspect. I prefer large, healthy,\r\ntwo-year-old trees, planted with a lister, subsoil plow, and spade. I\r\ncultivate my orchard to corn, small fruit, potatoes and nursery stock\r\nseven years, with a cutaway disc harrow, and cease cropping after eight\r\nyears; I plant nothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential;\r\nwould make them of Russian mulberry, Osage orange, or cedars, by\r\nplanting two rows of them on the south and west sides of the orchard.\r\nFor rabbits I keep a shot-gun and dogs. I do not prune; don't think it\r\nbeneficial. I do not thin my apples while on the tree, but think it\r\nwould pay. My trees are in mixed plantings; my Ben Davis are fuller and\r\nredder planted close by Jonathan and Winesap. I do not fertilize my\r\norchard, but think it would be beneficial, and would advise its use on\r\nall exhausted soils in old orchards. Do not pasture my orchard; would\r\nnot advise it, don't think it would pay. My trees are troubled with\r\nflathead borers, and my apples with curculio. I do not spray. I dig\r\nborers out with a knife.\r\n\r\nPick my apples by hand; have light-weight men climb the trees and pick\r\nin meal sacks, then lay on tables. Sort into two classes: First,\r\nperfect, well colored, smooth, and good size; second, wormy, fair, and\r\nsmall size. Pack in three-bushel barrels, well rounded up; mark the\r\nvariety of apples on the barrel with a stencil; haul to market on a\r\nhay-frame wagon. I sell in the orchard, wholesale, retail, and peddle;\r\nsell the best to highest bidder; sell the culls to driers or ship South\r\nor West. My best markets are where apples are scarcest. Do not dry any;\r\nit does not pay. Don't store any; I have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing, losing about one-twelfth of them. Do not irrigate. Prices\r\nhave been from $2 to $2.75 per barrel; dried apples, five cents per\r\npound. I employ men at seventy-five cents per day. Apple-growing in\r\nKansas, on high prairie land, is not very profitable to the grower,\r\nunless he has a good windbreak on south and west sides of his orchard.\r\nIn 1880 I planted twenty acres of apples trees of many varieties; Ben\r\nDavis and Jonathan were the only ones that paid me on high land. In 1895\r\nI planted thirty acres to apples; fifteen acres on upland and fifteen\r\nacres on second bottom, sloping east and north. On the upland I put\r\nnothing but Ben Davis and Jonathan; on the bottom I planted Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, Mammoth Black Twig, Gano, Winesap, and\r\nJonathan--cross-fertilizing the Ben Davis every fifth row with the\r\nMammoth Black Twig, Jonathan, and Winesap. I believe that\r\ncross-fertilization is beneficial to an orchard in making fruit more\r\nplentiful, larger, smoother, better color and quality. It is believed by\r\nmany that Ben Davis, Jonathan and Winesap are self-fertilizers, and\r\ndon't require crossing; that being the case, they should have the cross\r\nnear by, in order to not decrease the species or run it out. Professor\r\nDarwin says self-fertilization is abhorrent to nature, and the same rule\r\nthat applies to small fruits is equally applicable to apples. Why not?\r\n\r\nFruits and premium awards are my best advertisers. I have succeeded in\r\ncarrying off most of the awards in every show I exhibited at, and have\r\npremiums on file to show for some. All my fruits are set for\r\ncross-fertilization, and I shall continue to set that way. Many have\r\nsaid and will say they see no difference; perhaps they are not close\r\nobservers, and have given the subject little study. I have given the\r\nsubject twenty-five years' study and experience, and think I am not\r\nmistaken. I think there is more money to be made on our high upland in\r\npears, small fruits, and stone fruits. They pay me better than apples.\r\nThe Grimes's Golden Pippin would be a good apple to grow if the trees\r\ndid not die after two or three crops. The Lawver apples fail to hang on\r\nthe trees. The Missouri Pippin will not stand up on our high land unless\r\nsurrounded by windbreaks; they look here like a Kansas cyclone had\r\npassed through them--the limbs all blew off last fall. Winesaps fall off\r\nbadly, and are affected with bitter rot. For trial purposes, I recommend\r\nMammoth Black Twig, Gano, and York Imperial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. J. STAYMAN, Leavenworth, Leavenworth county: We came to Kansas\r\nthirty-nine years ago, and traveling over the eastern portion of the\r\nstate selected Leavenworth as the most desirable point to commence tree\r\nand fruit-growing. We were then engaged in that business in Illinois,\r\nand had collected over 1000 varieties of apples, which we brought to\r\nKansas; among them were nearly all the leading varieties then grown and\r\nmany new and rare kinds of local reputation. Our object in making this\r\ncollection was to grow them side by side, under the same conditions, to\r\nascertain their value. In 1860 we set an orchard of a few hundred trees,\r\nconsisting of about seventy varieties, two years old. Among them were\r\nBen Davis, Winesap, York Imperial, Willow Twig, Rambo, Rawle's Janet,\r\nWhite Pippin, and Jonathan, and the leading apples generally grown,\r\nincluding summer and fall varieties. At the same time we set out about\r\n1000 root grafts in a nursery. We then collected over 1000 more [scions]\r\nand top-grafted them [into standard trees], to get the fruit sooner.\r\nOver 1000 of these were received from the late Charles Downing. From\r\nthis collection, and from specimens of fruit received, we have been able\r\nto accurately describe over 2200 varieties, with an outline cut of each,\r\nwith seeds and core and all other characteristics. And to ascertain what\r\neffect climate had upon each variety, we kept an accurate meteorological\r\nrecord of the weather. This we furnished to the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nWashington, D. C., for ten years. We also grew the leading varieties on\r\nan elevation 400 feet higher, and on various aspects not over two miles\r\napart, and learned what effect elevation and aspect had upon the bearing\r\nquality of different varieties.\r\n\r\nFor commercial orchard I prefer Stayman, Winesap, York Imperial,\r\nJonathan, and White Pippin. It will be noticed that in the commercial\r\nlist we omitted Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Gano, and Willow Twig. These\r\nvarieties are all productive and profitable, but we believe the time has\r\ncome (or soon will be) that the public will demand something better, and\r\nto meet this demand we have made the change; but to those who do not\r\nbelieve in progress the above varieties will prove at least productive,\r\nif not so profitable as in the past. In making out the list of apples we\r\nhave hesitated somewhat in heading the list with Stayman, not from any\r\ndoubt about the apple, but from the fact that it is not generally known;\r\nbut this objection can be made against any apple when first introduced.\r\nThe following is the description we gave twenty-one years ago in our\r\nfruit notes: \"Fruit large, heavy, form oblate conic, regular; color\r\ngreenish yellow; mostly covered, splashed and striped with dark red;\r\nflesh yellow, firm, fine, tender, juicy, rich, mild, aromatic, subacid;\r\nquality good to best; season January to May. Seedling of Winesap; bore\r\nthe ninth year from the seed.\" After fruiting this apple over twenty\r\nyears we can add the following: It is a strong grower, has a darker\r\nleaf, is a better bearer, hangs on the tree better, is of larger size,\r\nis of much better quality, and will keep better than Winesap. Charles\r\nDowning gave a similar description of this apple in his appendix.\r\n[Stayman Winesap.] R. J. Black, of Ohio, one of the best-posted\r\npomologists, who has fruited it for years, puts it at the head of both\r\nthe commercial and family lists, and says: \"It has all the qualities of\r\nthe Winesap without any of its faults.\" Prof. H. E. Van Deman, who has\r\nfruited it and seen it fruited in Delaware, puts it at the head of the\r\nlist, and writes in respect to the change of name: \"Stayman (apple) is\r\nworth almost a lifetime to produce.\" \"Now, I have been so impressed with\r\nits coming value and popularity, that I have thought it ought to be\r\nshortened in name to _Stayman_.\" J. W. Kerr, of Delaware, says: \"It is\r\nsuperior to its parent, the Winesap, in size, color, flavor, and keeping\r\nquality. The tree is more vigorous in growth. After several years'\r\nfruiting, I have no hesitation in saying it is the finest all-round\r\nwinter apple that has come under my notice.\" Professor Heiges writes us\r\nabout the same in substance. Prof G. H. Powell, of the Delaware\r\nExperiment Station, says: \"In quality it equals the Northern Spy, and is\r\nin season from October to May.\" We could give many quotations of equal\r\nvalue from _Rural New Yorker_, _Green's Fruit Grower_, and _National\r\nStockman and Farmer_.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above we find the following in the last-named paper of\r\nMay 26: \"One variety, Stayman, mentioned frequently in these columns, a\r\nseedling raised by our correspondent, Dr. J. Stayman, of Kansas, from\r\nthe old Winesap, receives special commendation. It is remarkable that,\r\nin the wide section of country between Kansas and Delaware, in Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Pennsylvania, and Missouri, wherever this variety has been\r\ntried, it has developed the same excellences of size, quality, and\r\nkeeping, as well as of vigor and productiveness. Lovers of choice apples\r\nwill not fail to make a note of this.\" Winesap we place second on the\r\nlist, after a fair trial of over thirty-five years side by side with Ben\r\nDavis. Give it good soil and high cultivation and but few apples will\r\nexcel it. York Imperial we place third. It is not of the highest\r\nquality, but it is better than Ben Davis, and will keep in a common\r\ncellar, and command a high price. It is very productive in alternate\r\nyears, and a hardy tree. Although we introduced this apple into the\r\nstate thirty-eight years ago, yet its commercial value is scarcely\r\nknown. Jonathan, perhaps, should stand at the head of the list for its\r\ngreat beauty, fine quality, and productiveness; but it matures so early,\r\ndrops so badly, keeps so poorly, and requires so much care in handling,\r\nthat we hesitate doing so. It is, however, a very profitable apple when\r\nwell handled, and cannot be omitted, as no other in its season equals\r\nit. White Pippin: This apple of unknown origin and seldom mentioned\r\nshould be better known, as it is far superior to the famous Newtown or\r\nAlbemarle Pippin of the same type. We have had it in bearing on high and\r\nlow land as long as any other apple, and find it very productive in\r\nalternate years, of the best quality, and bringing the best price. It\r\nkeeps better, drops less, is of larger size, equal in quality, and will\r\nbring as high a price, where known, as the Jonathan. In a commercial\r\norchard there should be few, if any, fall or summer varieties, unless\r\nfavorably located; they should be of the best shipping and market\r\nvarieties, as Early Ripe, Duchess of Oldenburg, Orange Pippin, Cooper's\r\nEarly White, Jefferis, Muster, and Dr. Watson. These are all early\r\nbearers, very productive and salable, and of fine quality for table or\r\nkitchen. Those best for a family orchard are Stayman, Winesap, Jonathan,\r\nWhite Pippin, Mason's Orange, Summer Extra, Garretson's Early, Summer\r\nPearmain, Early Joe, Jefferis, Early Ripe, Duchess of Oldenburg, Dr.\r\nWatson, Muster, and Wagener; and for sweet apples there are none better\r\nthan Broadwell, Ramsdell, Superb, Baltzby, and Mountaineer.\r\n\r\nAll these apples are early bearers, productive, and fine for family use,\r\nand we cannot well discard any; but eight or ten trees, of summer and\r\nfall varieties together, are enough to supply the largest family. It is\r\nbetter, however, to plant one of each variety, that we may have a\r\nsuccession of fruit throughout the season; also, if one variety should\r\nfail, others might not. It would require a very long list to name all we\r\nhave tried and discarded, but we will name some: Rawle's Janet we\r\nreject, as it runs too small and cracks badly; Ben Davis, Missouri\r\nPippin, Willow Twig, Gano, Arkansas Black and Mammoth Black Twig are all\r\nproductive, but of poor quality; Maiden's Blush, Lowell, Porter, Rome\r\nBeauty, Western Beauty, Fulton, Trenton Early, Cole's Quince, and many\r\nothers, because they ripen too irregularly and drop too badly. The White\r\nWinter Pearmain, Lawver, McAfee and Kansas Keeper blight badly and are\r\nnot sure bearers; Early Harvest and Red Astrachan are not hardy; Summer\r\nRose, Early Strawberry and Benoni are fine, but too small; Primate,\r\nChenango and Gulley of Pennsylvania are too tender to handle; Smith's\r\nCider, Hay's Wine, Fallawater, Scott's Best and Nonpareil Russet are\r\nproductive, but ripen early and are not profitable. Many Southern winter\r\nvarieties are too small, such as Haley, Gully, Kittageskee, and Harris.\r\nFew if any Eastern winter apples are of any value here, as Northern Spy,\r\nBaldwin, Canada Red, Swaar, Sutton Beauty and Melon all ripen too early,\r\nand become poor, dry, fall apples. It is the same with all Northern\r\napples, from whatever source or locality. It is a mistake to think we\r\ncan find a winter apple adapted to Kansas that originated north of\r\nKansas, under a lower mean temperature. This we have fully demonstrated\r\nbeyond the possibility of a doubt.\r\n\r\nEarly apples require a specific amount of heat to bring them to maturity\r\nfrom the time the fruit forms. If brought from a colder climate to a\r\nwarmer one, you hasten its growth and accelerate its maturity just in\r\nproportion to the difference in mean temperature of the two localities,\r\nand consequently it ripens in the fall here. I prefer hilltop for\r\nquality, keeping, and color, and bottom for size. Hilltop and steep\r\nbluffs are the best for all kinds of winter apples, as they produce the\r\nrichest fruit, with the finest color, and they keep the best and are not\r\nso subject to injurious pests. Fifty feet of abrupt elevation is equal\r\nin its effect to fifty miles of latitude south on frosty nights. It\r\nretards spring growth as much as forty miles north. An elevation of 400\r\nfeet makes a difference of from ten to twenty-five per cent. in the\r\namount of saccharine matter in fruit, to which rich quality, fine flavor\r\nand aroma are due. Bottom land produces the largest apples, more murky\r\nin color and more irregular in bearing. Rolling, intermediate Kansas\r\nland will prove satisfactory. East and south slopes hasten the maturity\r\nof fruit, and are the best for early varieties; a northern slope retards\r\nthe ripening of fruit and is the best for winter apples. The best\r\nspecimens of apples we ever saw in Kansas grew on a northern bench about\r\nthirty feet below the top of an elevation of 400 feet, on good, rich,\r\nwell-drained soil. They were large in size, clear in color, and perfect\r\nin form. We prefer any good soil that will produce a good corn crop,\r\nwith a well-drained clay subsoil; mucky, wet or hard-pan soils are not\r\nfit for fruit. Land that produces a good crop of wheat is rich enough.\r\nWe have seen a very heavy crop of York Imperial at its native home on\r\nquite thin freestone land. Almost any of the land in Leavenworth county\r\nis naturally rich enough if we only keep it so.\r\n\r\nI prefer two-year-old untrimmed trees, set in furrows made with a\r\ntwo-horse plow, no deeper than we plant the trees, but wide enough to\r\ntake in the roots. We set them about two inches deeper than they stood\r\nin the nursery, on the solid subsoil, and pack the dirt firmly amongst\r\nthe roots; lean or set the heaviest top to the southwest. The largest\r\nand heaviest roots, if convenient, should be in the same direction.\r\nAfter filling the hole, bank up a steep mound of earth around the tree.\r\nIf this is properly done no ordinary wind will ever move it. We prefer\r\ntwo-year-old or strong one-year-old trees, because they can be set more\r\nrapidly, cost less labor, less money, live better, and grow more stocky.\r\nWe want them taken up with care, give no pruning whatever, neither \"cut\r\ntheir tops in to balance the roots,\" when planting in orchard. Trees\r\nthat are taken up when young and set out in an open orchard without\r\npruning grow stronger and more stocky, bear sooner, and are less subject\r\nto blight, sun-scald, and the attack of flathead and roundhead borers.\r\nWe have root-grafted as many as 500,000 in one season on sections of\r\nroots from two to six inches long with scions from three to twenty\r\ninches long, to see which were the best. Two-inch sections from one-year\r\nroots, grafted with scions about six inches long, set deep enough to\r\nform roots on the stock, are best. This \"whole-root graft\" is simply a\r\n_humbug_. It is the strength and vigor of seedling roots, not the length\r\nof them, that make the best-rooted trees. No sensible man will pretend\r\nto graft whole seedlings [roots] and set them out in a nursery. It\r\ncannot be done with success. We must cut off a portion of the root to do\r\nit. The question arises, how much? It is then not a whole root, and it\r\nbecomes a question what length of root is best. It is not advisable to\r\nbud or graft seedling trees in the nursery, for all seedlings are not of\r\nthe same vigor and hardiness; consequently the trees would differ\r\nsimilarly.\r\n\r\nI plant my orchard to corn, potatoes, garden-truck, and small fruits,\r\nand keep this up, with clean cultivation, using a Planet jr. horse hoe,\r\nuntil they begin to bear, and cease cropping after ten years, planting\r\nnothing unless the above-mentioned crops or clover in a bearing orchard.\r\nWindbreaks are injurious unless planted at least 200 feet from the\r\norchard. The best protection is to plant the two outer rows of\r\nfruit-trees close together; they can be cut out, if desired, when they\r\nbecome too thick. This is better than high-growing shelter trees or\r\nevergreens. We want a free circulation of air to pass among the trees. A\r\nhigh and heavy protection produces an eddy which blights and sun-scalds\r\nthe trees, as well as hastens the ripening and dropping of apples. We\r\nhave had no occasion to use any protection from rabbits and borers since\r\nwe quit pruning off the lower limbs. Pruning is not thoroughly\r\nunderstood. Trees are pruned to make them live, grow fast and stocky,\r\nand also slender; to make them bear young, give form, light and air, and\r\nto make them look alike; to bear heavy crops and fine specimens. It is\r\nclaimed all this can be done by pruning; it can be accomplished without\r\npruning in a much shorter time and without extra labor. We do not\r\nrecommend pruning apple trees at any times excepting _after_ the trees\r\nare well established in the orchard; then the lower limbs _may_ be\r\ngradually removed to form the head, about two feet from the ground; but\r\nthe longer we allow them to remain the heavier and stockier they become;\r\nfor the body of the tree increases in size just in proportion to the\r\namount of foliage on the lower limbs. We prune off dead, broken and\r\nsucker limbs, and have no objections to taking off limbs that chafe each\r\nother (if this should happen from neglect). We have lost more trees from\r\npruning than from all other causes together. We have seen large orchards\r\njust in their prime that have been so injured from pruning that they\r\nnever recovered. On the other hand, I have seen orchards that were so\r\nneglected, dilapidated and crowded that I thought a thorough pruning\r\nwould make them more productive. I never thin the fruit on the trees; it\r\nis not necessary.\r\n\r\nPollination is no doubt an important factor in productiveness, size,\r\nquality, and form. We have had no opportunity to test the result with\r\napples, as our varieties are all mixed up together. We would not plant\r\nin an orchard large blocks of any variety excessively; better have them\r\nintermixed with other varieties that bloom at the same time. The pollen\r\nof one variety may be congenial to some, while it may be neglected\r\n[repelled] by another; we will have to learn this by experience, or\r\nplant a less number of varieties together. We have little experience yet\r\nin planting large orchards of few kinds. Perhaps none of these varieties\r\nthat are esteemed so highly are congenial to each other. We had better\r\ngo slow about planting out 10,000 to 20,000 of one kind together. We may\r\nhave gone too far now. We do not use any fertilizer for our trees only\r\nas we crop the land. The virgin soil of our county does not need\r\nfertilizing if planted in orchard until the tree comes into bearing,\r\nexcept we crop the land. It is, however, a mistake to think we can grow\r\nan orchard and crop the ground at the same time, without any injury to\r\nthe orchard, unless we restore the lost fertility in some way. Orchards\r\nso exhaust the soil in about sixteen years' cropping that it is worth\r\nlittle afterwards. \"It is estimated that an acre of apples in good\r\nbearing removes annually about forty-nine pounds of nitrogen,\r\nthirty-eight pounds of phosphoric acid, and seventy-two pounds of\r\npotash. If the fertility and productiveness of the orchard is to be kept\r\nup, these fertilizing elements must be returned in some form.\" At the\r\nmarket value of these fertilizing materials, it amounts annually to\r\nabout twelve dollars an acre. It is estimated that an orchard will be in\r\nfull bearing in about ten years. Then in six years of full bearing it\r\nwill have exhausted the soil to the amount of seventy-two dollars per\r\nacre. Take in consideration the previous cropping of ten years, need we\r\nwonder what is the matter with our orchard? Should we diminish the feed\r\nof a vigorous horse annually for ten years, do you think he could pull\r\nthe same load, or be of much value? The nitrogen is the most expensive\r\nelement, representing about half of the whole, yet it can be restored to\r\nthe soil by crimson or red clover, peas, vetches, beans, cow-peas, or\r\nturnips, which have the ability of converting the free nitrogen of the\r\nair into available plant food. The best method of accomplishing this end\r\nis to grow these crops on the land and plow them under in their green\r\nstate at about maturity. I do not pasture my orchard; it is not\r\nadvisable and does not pay. My apples are troubled with codling-moth. I\r\ndo not spray. For borers, I bank the trees, so that if they deposit\r\ntheir eggs they can be gotten out easily.\r\n\r\nI pick my apples in baskets and sacks from a ladder, and sort them into\r\nthree classes: first, second, and culls. I pack in baskets and barrels;\r\npress them in barrels, and mark with name of variety. I wholesale my\r\napples in the orchard to dealers; market the best in baskets and\r\nbarrels, sell my second and third grades the best way I can, and throw\r\nthe culls away. My best market is at home. I never tried distant\r\nmarkets, and do not dry any. I am successful in storing apples for\r\nwinter in boxes and barrels in a cellar, and find Ben Davis, Stayman,\r\nWillow Twig and York Imperial keep best. In storing apples for winter,\r\nthey should be picked before they are too ripe and when the weather is\r\nnot too hot; when picked they should be taken at once to shade and\r\npacked and stored away in the cool of the evening. They should be well\r\nsorted, packed in tight barrels, and headed up to exclude the light and\r\nair. They will keep longer if each apple is wrapped with paper. The\r\ntemperature of your cave or cellar should be reduced as much as possible\r\nby throwing the doors open at night and closing them through the day. A\r\ngradual reduction and a regular temperature is better than a sudden\r\nchange. Apples should not be hauled about in the hot sun before storing\r\nthem away, neither should they be placed in cold storage at once. The\r\nchange is too sudden. It is the same in taking them out of cold storage.\r\nIt should not be done at once. A storing room for this purpose should be\r\nprovided in every cold-storage plant. I do not have to repack stored\r\napples if they are sold early, but if not until late we have to repack.\r\nThe loss depends upon the variety. I have tried irrigation on a small\r\nscale, but do not irrigate now. Prices have been from fifty cents to two\r\ndollars per barrel. I employ men that are capable of packing apples,\r\npaying from five to ten cents per hour. We seldom hear anything about\r\nfall planting, as if it was a settled fact that the spring was the best\r\nor the only time it could be done successfully.\r\n\r\nAll of our trees for the last thirty-eight years have been transplanted\r\nin the fall, excepting the last three years they were set out in the\r\nspring. The difference is decidedly in favor of fall planting; they\r\nstart in growth earlier and make a much stronger growth the first\r\nseason, and there is a gain of nearly a year in size over those planted\r\nin the spring, and they certainly have lived better. Why should they not\r\ndo better? We have more time and less hurry to do the work well, the\r\nground is in better condition, the trees have more time to callus and\r\nbecome firmly established. It is often too wet to take the trees up and\r\ntransplant them early, and late setting is not advisable. The distance\r\ntrees should be set apart is a more important matter than is generally\r\nsupposed. Very few ever think how large a tree will grow and the space\r\nit will occupy. Almost every thrifty variety will grow and spread, and\r\nrequire a foot of space each year; that would be ten feet in ten years\r\nand forty feet in forty years; in other words, the trees will meet in\r\nforty years if set forty feet apart. This holds good in Kansas;\r\nconsequently, forty feet apart is too close to plant trees if we expect\r\nan orchard to last that long. Apple trees will bear and be profitable\r\nfor that length of time if they have sufficient space, receive proper\r\ncare and cultivation, and the fertility of the soil is not allowed to\r\nbecome exhausted. Many set their trees 16x32 feet for the purpose of\r\ngetting a large crop when the trees first come into bearing, with the\r\nintention of cutting out every other row when they crowd, but we fear\r\nvery few if any ever think this will have to be done in fifteen years\r\nfrom the setting or the orchard would be ruined and the land very much\r\nimpoverished. It would be much better and more profitable to set the\r\ntrees 24x24 feet and cut every other row out in twenty-four years, at\r\nleast one way, and if they crowded, both ways, and not crop the land at\r\nall, except to keep up the fertility of the soil. By this method we\r\ncould have a good bearing orchard for forty years or longer, which would\r\npay better than closer planting and cropping the land to pay the\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDAVID BROWN, Richmond, Franklin county: Have lived in Kansas thirty-four\r\nyears; have an orchard of 2000 trees, averaging twenty years planted,\r\ncomposed entirely of Ben Davis, Jonathan, and Winesap; have discarded\r\neverything else. I would plant on nothing but deep upland soil, planting\r\ngood yearling trees. I grow no crop in the orchard, and cultivate\r\nthoroughly always with plow and harrow. I have quit pruning, as it kills\r\nthe trees. Never pasture the orchard. I spray with London purple for the\r\ncanker-worm and codling-moth. Borers I cut out. I always sell at\r\nwholesale to shippers at about eighty cents per barrel. Never dry any or\r\nstore any for winter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRANCIS GOBLE, Leavenworth, Leavenworth county: Have been in Kansas over\r\nforty-three years. I have 13,000 apple trees, ranging in age from last\r\nspring's setting to forty years. For commercial purposes I use Ben\r\nDavis, Winesap, Jonathan, Missouri Pippin, Ingram, Maiden's Blush,\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, and Smith's Cider. For family use I would advise\r\nJonathan, Winesap, Early Harvest, Rambo, and Milam. I have tried and\r\ndiscarded numerous varieties. I prefer medium to high land, with a clay\r\nand loam soil on a subsoil of clay and sand; any slope is better than\r\nsouthwest. I have planted trees of all ages, and all look well. I plant\r\nthirty-two feet east and west and sixteen feet north and south. I\r\nbelieve in thorough cultivation with plow, harrow, etc., as long as the\r\norchard lives. Sometimes the orchard requires a certain kind of\r\ncultivation, at other times a different cultivation. In a young orchard\r\nI usually grow corn, potatoes, wheat, melons, or pumpkins. In a bearing\r\norchard I usually grow nothing, though sometimes I take a crop of millet\r\nor pumpkins from the ground. I cease cropping entirely at from five to\r\nseven years. Windbreaks are not necessary here; they make their own\r\nwindbreak if kept thoroughly cultivated and full of life. Thorough\r\nprotection will largely prevent borers; if any are found in the tree I\r\nremove them with a knife and wire. For rabbits I wrap with paper or\r\nother material.\r\n\r\nI prune with a saw to keep down surplus wood growth and improve the\r\nquality of the apples. It is beneficial if carefully done, a little\r\nevery spring and not much at once. I believe thinning will pay when the\r\ntrees are abnormally full. Remove as nearly as possible all defective\r\nfruit when half grown, and what is left will be of higher grade in size,\r\ncolor, and quality. I believe a decomposed stable fertilizer is\r\nnecessary on some soils. Better not pasture with any stock whatever; I\r\ndo not think it advisable; I think the profit (?) would be an expensive\r\none. Am troubled somewhat with canker-worm, bud moth, borers,\r\nleaf-rollers, codling-moth, curculio, and gouger. I sprayed one year for\r\ninsects generally with London purple through the spring season, and do\r\nnot think it was a success. I pick about as Judge Wellhouse does, and\r\nsort into three classes; the best we make firsts, the best half of the\r\nbalance we call seconds, and the balance are simply culls. We pack in\r\nbarrels and haul to market with wagons provided with racks holding\r\nsixteen barrels each. I sell my best apples at wholesale, but have never\r\nsold them in the orchard; the second grade I sell to groceries and\r\npeddlers; the culls I sell to anybody, usually in the orchard. I have\r\nnever tried distant markets. I never dry any. I store for winter in a\r\ncold store built for the purpose on my own farm, which has been\r\ndescribed in the paper. I have also tried artificial cold storage, and\r\nthe Jonathans kept well. [See Cold Store.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. P. DIEHL, Olathe, Johnson county: I have lived in Kansas thirty\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 700 trees, twenty inches in diameter,\r\ntwenty-nine years old. For market I prefer York Imperial, Jonathan,\r\nWinesap, and Ben Davis, and for family orchard Early Harvest, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Winesap, and York Imperial. Have tried and discarded Bellflower,\r\nDominie, Pennsylvania Red Streak, and White Winter Pearmain. I prefer\r\nhilltop with a mulatto limestone soil, northeast aspect. Would plant\r\ntwo-year-old trees, forty feet apart. I plant my orchard to corn and\r\npotatoes for five years, using a cultivator; cease cropping after six\r\nyears; plant nothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; I\r\nwould make them of trees, planted on the south, west, and north. I prune\r\nwith a knife and saw; think it beneficial. I thin the fruit on my trees\r\nthe latter part of May, and think it pays. My trees are in mixed\r\nplantings. I fertilize my orchard; think it beneficial and that it pays.\r\nPasture my orchard very little, late in the fall, with horses; think it\r\nadvisable and that it pays. My trees are troubled with canker-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, bud moth, root aphis, bagworm, flathead borer,\r\nroundhead borer, woolly aphis, twig-borer, and oyster-shell bark-louse;\r\nand my apples with codling-moth. I spray with London purple, using a\r\nforce-pump, and think I have reduced the codling-moth. Those insects not\r\naffected by spraying I dig out with knife and wire. I hand-pick my\r\napples from a step-ladder into a sack with a hoop in the mouth. Sort\r\ninto three classes: first, second, and third; pack by hand in\r\nthree-bushel barrel, mark with stencil, and ship by rail. I sell my\r\napples in the orchard, wholesale and retail. Sell my best ones to apple\r\ndealers. Sell my second- and third-grade apples at the stores; make\r\nvinegar of the culls. I have dried apples with an American dryer with\r\nsatisfaction; after dry, pack in barrels; we find a ready market for\r\nthem and think it pays. I store apples for winter in bulk in a cave and\r\nam successful; I find York Imperial and Rawle's Janet keep best. We have\r\nto repack stored apples before marketing, losing about twenty per cent.\r\nof them. I do not irrigate. I get six cents per pound for dried apples.\r\nI employ men at $1.25 per day.\r\n\r\nIn the growing of apples in Kansas many things are to be well\r\nconsidered. That injunction of Davy Crockett's must be kept constantly\r\nin view to be successful: \"Be sure you're right, then go ahead.\" First,\r\nto select varieties that are well adapted to your soil; next, location;\r\nlast but not least, the preparation of the soil and future care. Many of\r\nthe varieties that are well adapted to the Eastern states are\r\nunprofitable here. Another great mistake is the planting of too many\r\nvarieties. When I first came to this state thirty years ago, I consulted\r\nCol. A. S. Johnson, now of Topeka. From him I obtained a great deal of\r\nvaluable information, he having had thirty-six years of Kansas\r\nexperience. I should, no doubt, have planted many that I did not, owing\r\nto the information obtained of him; so it may be seen that, by proper\r\ncare, experience, and observation, we may be of benefit to the rising\r\ngeneration. Having selected your varieties by consulting the published\r\nfruit list of the Kansas State Horticultural Society, next select your\r\nlocation. Select, if you can, the highest northern slope; next east,\r\nnext west. Put your ground in good order by plowing and subsoiling at\r\nleast fifteen inches deep. Should there be any tenacious soil or spouty\r\nplaces, tile with four-inch tile, forty feet apart, three feet deep. A\r\ngreat mistake is made by many in planting too closely. I have trees\r\ntwenty-eight years old, forty feet from tip to tip. Plant to some\r\ncultivated crop for six years, then seed to clover; trim your trees each\r\nFebruary; keep the borers out, and if they do get into your trees hunt\r\nthem out; spray your trees frequently at the proper time to prevent the\r\nnoxious insects from getting the start of you, and when your trees\r\ncommence to bear commence to fertilize by turning under clover and\r\nstable litter. Horace Greeley once said: \"You might as well expect milk\r\nfrom a cow tied to a stake as apples from an orchard uncared for.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. MUNGER, Hollis, Cloud county: I have lived in Kansas fifteen years;\r\nhave an apple orchard of seventy-five trees twelve inches in diameter,\r\neighteen feet high, seventeen years old. I prefer for market Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and, to a limited extent, Yellow Transparent and\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, and for a family orchard add Early Harvest and\r\nMaiden's Blush. Have tried and discarded the Willow Twig on account of\r\nblight and rot. I prefer bottom land, with a loose subsoil, and young\r\nand stocky trees. I plant my orchard to potatoes, beans and vines for\r\nten years, and use a cultivator that keeps three inches very mellow, and\r\ncease cropping when impossible to cultivate. I grow weeds in the orchard\r\nand mow them. Windbreaks are not essential, but are very desirable;\r\nwould make them of Osage orange, Russian mulberries, or box-elder. Set\r\nthe first row four feet apart, the second six inches, and never trim;\r\nthe third six feet. For rabbits I use traps and gun. I hunt the borers\r\nand encourage the birds. I prune my trees so as to give air and\r\nsunshine; think it pays. Do not thin the fruit while on the trees. My\r\napples are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard in the winter with\r\nstable litter fresh from the stable; it appears to do good, and would\r\nadvise its use, with judgment, on all soils. I pasture my orchard with\r\nhogs and calves. I do not think it advisable among young trees. My trees\r\nare troubled with leaf-roller, and my fruit with codling-moth. I spray\r\njust after the blossom falls, with Paris green, for the codling-moth.\r\nPrices have been from 25 cents to $1 per bushel. What the future of\r\napple-growing in northern central Kansas may be, it is of course\r\nimpossible to tell, but from the success of the few orchards that have\r\nbeen planted, and after being planted have received some attention\r\nbesides that bestowed by calves and pigs, it would seem well worth a\r\ntrial. There are years when the best attention possible cannot prevent\r\ndamage and some loss from drought, especially on upland. For this reason\r\nbottom land would seem more suitable for an orchard in this county, even\r\nthough subject to some disadvantages. In some orchards on low land only\r\na few feet above the water-level, where a sandy subsoil admits of a free\r\nnatural subirrigation, the thrift and productiveness of the trees have\r\nbeen unusually good. Cold seems to be dreaded less than hot, dry weather\r\nin the latter part of the summer, although late spring frosts sometimes\r\ndo damage. Even the traditional \"north slope\" might have its advantages\r\nsomewhat balanced in this county by the valley lands that retain a large\r\namount of moisture.\r\n\r\nA good soil with a loose subsoil that holds the greatest possible amount\r\nof water are the most important requirements as to location. If the\r\ncultivation is then such as to save the water of early summer rains to\r\nthe best advantage until the dry weather of the late summer comes, it\r\nwill be drawn upon, and some very dry seasons may be tided over without\r\nmuch loss. Plowing in the spring and very frequent shallow cultivation\r\nafterwards are, as yet, the best known means to this end; and as a\r\ngeneral rule they are sufficient to answer every purpose as far west as\r\ncentral Kansas, without artificial watering, as the average rainfall\r\nshows; but if the early rains are allowed to go to waste by falling on\r\nthe hard ground and running directly off, or by rapid evaporation from\r\nan undisturbed surface, where capillary force is rapidly carrying back\r\nto the surface what has already soaked in, we invite ultimate failure\r\nwhen the drought comes. Cultivate once a week, or after each rain, when\r\nthey come oftener than that, with something that will keep two or three\r\ninches of very fine, mellow earth on the surface, and will cause an\r\namount of water to be retained in the soil below the earth mulch that\r\nwill surprise any one who has never tried it. An ordinary harrow will do\r\nvery well, or better a five-tooth cultivator, behind which I fasten a\r\n2x4 scantling with large wire nails driven through it, about two inches\r\napart, weighted on the back edge to keep it right side up; the scantling\r\nis cut as long as the width of the cultivator. At one operation the\r\ncultivator and this harrow leave the ground about like a hand-rake\r\nwould, marked only by the footprints of the driver. Last summer this was\r\nused several times where young peach trees had been set out, going\r\naround each row and sometimes over the entire ground. There was no time\r\nduring the summer that the trees stopped growing or showed signs of\r\nneeding more moisture than they had. Nine hundred and ninety-four lived,\r\nthe horses killed two, and the borers two more. Fifteen years ago I\r\nbought a small farm having on it a small family orchard of seventy-two\r\napple trees. It included several varieties, from summer to winter sorts.\r\n\r\nThe trees were 28x28 feet apart, with peach trees alternating both ways,\r\nmaking three times as many peaches as apples in the orchard. The land\r\nwas cultivated until the trees were ten years old, then sowed to timothy\r\nand clover. The timothy soon died out; but the clover lived for a few\r\nyears, but is gone now. It happened that some of the years that it was\r\nnot cultivated were some of the driest during the fifteen, and several\r\ntrees died of blight. Would this have happened if the cultivation had\r\nbeen continued? I have gone to plowing and cultivating again, anyway,\r\nwith no crop in the orchard. The trees are now fifteen or twenty feet\r\nhigh, and about twelve inches in diameter at the ground. The peach trees\r\nhave mostly been cut out. Cannot see that they did any harm, unless it\r\nmight have been harder on the apple trees during the dry season; but if\r\nit was, the peaches were worth about as much as the apples, and the\r\ntrees make a quick, bushy growth, thus forming a shelter for the apple\r\ntrees, which now stand straight and are well balanced. We have had a\r\npeach crop about half of the years. Potatoes, beans and vine crops were\r\nraised in the orchard the first few years. It was surrounded by a\r\nwindbreak of cottonwood and box-elder trees, several rows, seven feet\r\napart each way. This is certainly very beneficial; but Russian\r\nmulberries grow as well, make a thicker top, and at the same time invite\r\nbirds to keep up their quarters there and make their homes with us, \"a\r\nconsummation devoutly to be wished.\" Osage orange, planted the same as\r\nfor a hedge and never cut back, will make a better windbreak than\r\ncottonwood or box-elder, and a fence at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis orchard has borne variable crops, some good, some light, but always\r\nfruits. It is on bottom land sloping very slightly to the southeast;\r\nsoil a sandy loam with a clay subsoil. It has been pruned considerably,\r\nbut not very much at a time. One man in this county who succeeds well\r\nwith apples never prunes, except to keep the center open to sun and air.\r\nAnother near him gave his orchard a severe trimming a few years ago, and\r\nhad no fruit, but some dead trees for two or three years afterward. In\r\nplanting, the ground should be well plowed, then mark off one way with a\r\nplow or lister. Twice to the row with the lister, with three or four\r\nhorses, and the subsoiler well down, will make a very good preparation\r\nfor small trees without much digging, and small trees are best for\r\nseveral reasons: they are cheaper, less work to set out, and more likely\r\nto live. Set stakes to go by, and, in planting, cross the furrows. We\r\nhave just finished setting 2000 peach trees in this way, and very little\r\ndigging was needed. Then cultivate well and often. Rub off shoots that\r\nstart where limbs are not wanted, and start an evenly balanced top of\r\nfour or five limbs. A year after the trees are set out, if any of them\r\nare leaning much, dig away the dirt on the side from which they lean,\r\nand set them up straight, tramping the dirt well on the opposite side.\r\n\r\nWith winter will come the rabbits, and they will girdle the trees if not\r\nprevented. Many and varied are the sure cures for them, but none are\r\nperfect. A wash of ordinary whitewash and a pint of sulphur to the\r\nbucketful, applied with a brush or swab to the bodies of the trees,\r\ngenerally stops their work, but if the rain washes it off it must be put\r\non again or they will resume operations. A little coal-oil added to the\r\nwhitewash prevents the rain from having so much effect on it; make it\r\nthin, so it will not scale off so badly. Two applications have been\r\nenough for our young trees the past winter. We also use traps which are\r\nvery similar to the Wellhouse traps, described in the Kansas State\r\nHorticultural Report for 1897. Tarred paper, corn-stalks, veneering,\r\nscreen wire, cloth tied around the trees, or a woven-wire fence around\r\nthe entire orchard, are all among the practical means used to fence\r\nagainst rabbits; but don't try the plan of one of my neighbors, unless\r\nyou have too many trees; he applied coal-tar; it kept the rabbits off,\r\nand his orchard is now a treeless corn-field.\r\n\r\nDuring winter we haul manure direct from the stable and spread under the\r\ntrees (not against them) out as far as the ends of the limbs. On good\r\nground I would not do much of this until the trees get to bearing, as it\r\nwould interfere somewhat with cultivation and would not be needed, but\r\nwhen a good annual crop is taken from the orchard something must be\r\nreturned, or the supply is going to run out. On thin land rotten manure\r\napplied when the trees are small will do them good. Pasturing an orchard\r\nat any time is of doubtful expediency; it is safer not to. I have\r\nsprayed but once. That was done just after the blossoms fell, and again\r\nten days later. There were fewer wormy apples than usual. That was last\r\nyear. Think I will try it further.\r\n\r\nFor a home orchard Early Harvest, Yellow Transparent, Maiden's Blush,\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, Winesap, Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis do well\r\nhere and keep up a supply from first to last. For commercial planting\r\nBen Davis is perhaps best here as elsewhere. Missouri Pippin does well;\r\nWinesap bears enormously, but is too small, and gets smaller as the\r\ntrees get older. There is a good local demand here for Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin and a few of any very early variety. Willow Twig has been\r\nworthless on account of blight and rot. Encourage birds by every means,\r\nand never let one, or a nest, be disturbed, unless it is that\r\nbelligerent little alien, the English sparrow. They are at war with all\r\nthe feathered tribe, even with their own relations, and should be\r\nexterminated. Don't begrudge birds a few feeds of cherries and berries,\r\nwhen they work for nothing and board themselves nearly all the year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. H. BUCKMAN, Topeka, Shawnee county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-eight years; have an apple-orchard of 1000 trees two to\r\ntwenty-six years old. For market I prefer Maiden's Blush, Jonathan,\r\nWinesap, Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Huntsman's Favorite; and for a\r\nfamily orchard White Juneating (the earliest apple known), Red June,\r\nEarly Ripe, Duchess of Oldenburg, Sweet June, Fulton Strawberry,\r\nCooper's Early White, Smokehouse, Maiden's Blush, Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin, Jonathan, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, Ben Davis, Ramsdell Sweet,\r\nRoman Stem, and Red Romanite. I have tried and discarded King, on\r\naccount of rot, falls early, water core, short-lived; Kansas Keeper, on\r\naccount of blight, poor tree; Yellow Bellflower, on account of being a\r\nshy bearer and rot; Willow Twig, on account of blight; Lansingburg, on\r\naccount of blight when the tree is young; R. I. Greening, on account of\r\nits falling early, and rot. Baldwin, falls early and rots. Lawver, no\r\ngood on my soil. McAfee's Nonsuch, poor bearer. Rambo, not acclimated.\r\nNorthern Spy, rots. Pryor's Red, ripens unevenly, and is affected with\r\nscab. Dominie, there are many better of its season. Esopus Spitzenburg,\r\nrots badly. Rome Beauty, good some seasons. Ohio Nonpareil, poor bearer,\r\nfalls before ripe. Lowell, blights while trees are young. Winter Swaar,\r\nrots before perfectly ripe. Autumn Swaar, good of its season, and should\r\nhave a place in the family orchard. York Imperial, poor quality; rots\r\ntoo bad for commercial purposes. American Summer Pearmain, shy bearer\r\nwhile young. White Winter Pearmain, is affected with scab and is no\r\ngood. Red Winter Pearmain, falls off early; the tree is poor.\r\nGilliflowers, black and red, rot badly. Pennsylvania Red Streak,\r\naffected with scab; very good some seasons; trees die early. Sweet\r\nBough, trees die early. Bentley Sweet, keeps all right, moderate bearer;\r\ntree appears to be tender. Clayton, rots and is no good. Calvert is a\r\npoor bearer and rots with me. Pound Pippin, no value. Iowa Blush, no\r\nvalue, small. Red Vandervere, no value; rots. Vandervere Pippin,\r\nmoderate bearer and rots. Pennock Summer, good market in its season.\r\nPennock, fairly good; we have plenty better. Early Harvest is affected\r\nwith scab some seasons. Early Ripe is better and larger and to be\r\npreferred. Smith's Cider, blight, poor tree. Red Astrachan, poor bearer.\r\nRoxbury Russet, all russets fail with me. Jefferis, quality fine, but\r\nwill not bear. Ortley, good, but is inclined to rot.\r\n\r\nI prefer hilltop having a drift soil, but the subsoil is of more\r\nimportance than the surface soil. I prefer a north or northeast aspect.\r\nI prefer two-year-old, medium-sized trees, clear of root aphis, set in a\r\ndead furrow, with peach trees between north and south. I cultivate my\r\ntrees six years after planting, with a plow and five-tooth one-horse\r\ncultivator. Plant the young orchard to corn; cease cropping after six or\r\nseven years, and then seed down to clover. Windbreaks are essential;\r\nwould make them by planting one to six rows of Osage orange, red cedar\r\nor catalpas all around the orchard. The boys hunt the rabbits with\r\nshot-guns. I wash the trees with a carbolic-acid wash for borers. I\r\nprune with a knife and saw to balance the top, keep down watersprouts,\r\nand to get rid of useless wood. I think it pays and is beneficial, as it\r\nshades the body of the tree and keeps off the flathead borers. I do not\r\nthin the fruit. Can see no difference whether trees are in blocks of one\r\nvariety, or mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter\r\nall over the ground, and wood ashes around the trees, but do not believe\r\nit pays, and would not advise it on all soils; any soil that is suitable\r\nfor an orchard will not need enriching until after it ceases to be\r\nprofitable. I pasture my orchard with hogs and calves; I think it\r\nadvisable under certain conditions, and find it pays. My trees are\r\ntroubled with root aphis, roundhead borers and buffalo tree-crickets;\r\nand my apples with codling-moth. I do not spray. I pick my apples by\r\nhand, from a ladder, into a sack with a strap over the shoulder. I sell\r\nthe bulk of my apples in the orchard, from piles, at wholesale and\r\nretail; sell the grocers and fruit dealers what are left of my best\r\napples. Make cider of the second and third grades of apples. Feed the\r\nculls to the hogs. My best market is in Topeka. Never tried distant\r\nmarkets. Do not dry any. I store some apples for winter in bulk, in\r\nboxes and in barrels in a cellar. I have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing. Apples have been about forty cents a bushel in the orchard\r\nfor the last ten years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. HIGGINS, Seabrook, Shawnee county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 250 trees twenty-five years old. For\r\nmarket I prefer Winesap, Jonathan, Maiden's Blush, Smith's Cider, and\r\nBen Davis; for family orchard, Winesap, Jonathan, Maiden's Blush, Red\r\nJune, and Grimes's Golden Pippin. Have tried and discarded Kansas Keeper\r\non account of blight. I prefer hilltop; best below lime rock, with a\r\nnortheast slope. I prefer two-year-old, low-headed trees, set thirty\r\nfeet each way. I plant to corn for four years, then cease cropping, and\r\nseed to clover. I have a windbreak on the south side made of Osage\r\norange, to keep the hot winds off. I prune lightly to thin out some of\r\nthe middle branches; I think it pays. I do not thin my fruit. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with stable litter, and plow it under. I think it\r\nbeneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. I sow my orchard to\r\noats, and pasture with hogs with rings in their noses; they live on the\r\noats, and don't hurt the trees, but with the help of the chickens they\r\nkeep the canker-worms off. My trees are troubled with round- and\r\nflathead borers. I do not spray. I hand-pick my apples; sort into two\r\nclasses--shipping and cider. I sell my apples in the home market; sell\r\nsecond and third grades to the cider-mills. Never tried distant markets.\r\nI do not dry any. I am successful in storing apples in bulk in a cellar;\r\nfind Winesap to keep best. Prices have been from fifty to sixty cents\r\nper bushel. I employ young men at seventeen dollars per month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. C. BECKLEY, Spring Hill, Johnson county: I have lived in the state\r\nthirty years; have an apple orchard of 130 trees, twenty-eight years old\r\nand large for their age. For a commercial orchard I prefer Ben Davis,\r\nJonathan, and Missouri Pippin; and for family use Early Harvest,\r\nMaiden's Blush, Jonathan, and Winesap. I have tried and discarded\r\nSmith's Cider, Talman (Sweet), Rambo, Fameuse, Willow Twig, White Winter\r\nPearmain, Roman Stem, Dominie, Fallawater, Wagener, Baldwin, and White\r\nPippin, because they mature too soon, fall off and rot long before it is\r\ntime to pick them. I prefer hilltop with a dark mulatto soil and a clay\r\nsubsoil, with a western aspect. I prefer two-year-old trees, with plenty\r\nof fibrous roots, and a well-developed top, set forty by forty feet. I\r\ncultivate my orchard till it is six or seven years old with a common\r\nplow and harrow. In a young orchard I plant potatoes, corn, pumpkins,\r\nmelons, and garden-truck; I cease cropping after eight or nine years,\r\nand seed bearing orchard to clover. Windbreaks are not essential, unless\r\non the south and north sides; would make them of cedar or evergreens. I\r\nwould not make a windbreak at all. For rabbits I wrap the trees. When\r\nhunting borers I take knife and chisel and pare all gum and dirt off of\r\nthe roots; then I cut wherever I see signs of a borer until I get him,\r\nand if he has gone too deep to cut out I take a No. 20 wire six or eight\r\ninches long, bend a very small hook on one end, and run it up in the\r\nhole he has made, and ninety-nine times out of 100 pull him out. When\r\ndone put some alkali of some kind around the tree, such as lime, ashes,\r\nor soft soap; then cover up.\r\n\r\nI prune with a saw or knife, cutting out the crossed limbs and shaping\r\nthe top. I think it pays while the trees are young. I never thin the\r\nfruit while on the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize\r\nmy orchard with stable and hog manure; I think it very beneficial, and\r\nadvise its use on all soils, especially on old orchards. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs, and think it advisable at times. It pays. My trees\r\nare troubled with canker-worms, roundhead borers, and leaf rollers, and\r\nmy apples with codling-moths. I have never sprayed, but intend to this\r\nspring, in April and May. I am going to use a dust sprayer with London\r\npurple and Paris green for canker-worm. I pick my apples by hand from a\r\nladder into a sack, sort into two classes by hand, pack in a two-bushel\r\ncrate, fill full, with blossom end up, mark with the grade, and ship to\r\nmarket-place by freight. I retail apples in the orchard; sell my best\r\nones in crates; feed the culls to hogs. Best market is at home; never\r\ntried distant markets. We sun-dry some apples for home use, then heat on\r\nthe stove and put into paper sacks. I am quite successful in storing\r\napples in bulk, boxes and barrels in a cellar. Ben Davis, Winesap and\r\nLittle Romanite keep best. Sometimes I have to repack stored apples\r\nbefore marketing, losing about one per cent. of them. Prices have been\r\nabout sixty cents per bushel, and dried apples five to six cents;\r\nevaporated apples, seven to eight cents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALBERT PERRY, Troy, Doniphan county: Have lived in Kansas forty-one\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 5000 trees, planted from five to\r\ntwenty-four years. I grow for commercial purposes, first, Jonathan;\r\nsecond, Ben Davis, York Imperial, and Mammoth Black Twig. Ten years\r\nhence those who now plant Ben Davis will probably regret it. [?] There\r\nis a growing demand for a better eating apple. I now plant Jonathans and\r\nYork Imperial. The latter is a good bearer, and a vigorous tree, however\r\naged. For family orchard, I would advise adding to these Rambo and Fall\r\nStrawberry [Chenango]. I have tried and discarded many others. Prefer\r\nbottom, loess formation, near Missouri river. No slope has any advantage\r\nover another. Cultivate with plow and harrow, growing corn as an orchard\r\ncrop for five years; then seed to clover and blue grass only. Do not\r\ncare for windbreaks. Where there are windbreaks apples on trees do not\r\nget sufficient air. I protect from rabbits by tying corn-stalks about\r\nyoung trees. Prune some. I believe all apple blossoms are\r\nself-pollinating, and there is no advantage in mixed plantings. Need no\r\nfertilizers but clover in my locality. Believe it pays to pasture the\r\norchard with horses in the winter; if you have a stack of hay for them\r\nto go to they will not harm the trees. Am troubled with codling-moth and\r\napple curculio. Spray for codling-moth ten days after the apple is\r\nformed, and believe I have reduced their number. I use the knife for\r\nborers. Pick in baskets; deliver to packers in orchard. The aphis\r\nappears to do no particular injury to tree or fruit. Burn fall web-worm\r\nwith a coal-oil torch. Sort into number one, fancy, number two, fair but\r\ndefective in shape, color, or otherwise, and culls. Pack in three-bushel\r\nbarrels, pressed so they will not shake. Sell firsts in orchard; sell\r\nseconds in car lots in bulk; sell culls in bulk for cider or vinegar. My\r\nbest market is in the orchard. Have tried consigning to distant markets,\r\nbut it did not pay. Have stored second grades for winter in boxes and\r\nbarrels and in bulk, and made it pay. Ben Davis, Winesap and Rawle's\r\nJanet kept best. We sort and lose about one-fifth of the second grade\r\nonly. Prices have run from $1 to $1.50 per barrel, of late years, in the\r\norchard. For help in care of orchard I use men. In picking season I use\r\nall kinds of help. No experts. Pay from $1 to $1.50 per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. H. ROACH, Lowemont, Leavenworth county: Have been in Kansas forty-two\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 5500 trees; 800 planted thirty years,\r\n1200 planted thirteen years, and 3500 planted three years. For\r\ncommercial purposes I prefer Jonathan, Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinesap, and Willow Twig. For family use I prefer Jonathan, Huntsman's\r\nFavorite, and Winesap. I have discarded Yellow Bellflower, Rawle's\r\nJanet, and Russets. I prefer black loam with red gravel subsoil, hilltop\r\nwith extreme north slope, no matter how steep. I plant thrifty\r\ntwo-year-old trees, thirty-three feet apart each way, except Missouri\r\nPippin, which may be closer. Cultivate up to twelve years of age; grow\r\ncorn until seven, then clover two years; then corn one year, after that\r\nclover with a little timothy, to keep the weeds down. I cease cropping\r\nthe clover when the orchard is from twelve to fourteen years old. I\r\nconsider windbreaks harmful. Any good axle grease or \"dope\" will keep\r\noff rabbits. I trim until five years old with a pocket-knife, to give\r\nshape and stout branches. I believe fertilizers are beneficial, put on\r\nevery second or third year. I pasture my bearing orchard with horses and\r\ncattle, after the fruit is gathered until the 1st of January; think it\r\nis advisable and a benefit; allow no hogs in at any time. Am bothered\r\nsome with borers and codling-moth. Have never tried spraying, but would\r\nadvise it. We pick in sacks fastened over the shoulder with a snap and\r\nring. Usually sell in the orchard. Have tried artificial cold storage\r\nsatisfactorily, and think it the most reasonable plan. Prices have\r\nranged from $1 to $1.50 per barrel, for firsts and seconds, in the\r\norchard.

Grow only Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin for all\r\npurposes. I prefer bottom land in this locality, sandy loam with a\r\nnorthern aspect. Plant two-year, stocky trees, with a low top. I\r\ncultivate with the plow and disc, and grow no crop in the orchard. I\r\nbelieve a windbreak of box-elder or evergreens is beneficial but not\r\nessential. I prune very little, using my knife with judgment. I use\r\nstable litter as a mulch, and think it pays. I never pasture my orchard.\r\nHave few insects but codling-moth. I shade the body of the tree to keep\r\nborers out, and dig them out if any get in. I use ladders, and pick into\r\nbaskets, and sort into two classes--perfect and imperfect. My trees have\r\nnever borne a full crop, only enough for home use and the neighbors. We\r\nhave had several dry seasons, causing the fruit to fall badly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. S. GAYLORD, Muscotah, Atchison county: Have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-six years; have 5000 apple trees, planted from one to twelve\r\nyears.

I prefer hilltop with eastern slope, and would\r\nplant only two-year-old trees. I have grown both seedlings for stock and\r\nroot grafts, in the nursery. I believe in thorough cultivation with\r\ntwo-horse cultivator and double-shovel plow, using a five-tooth\r\ncultivator near the trees. I crop with corn from seven to nine years,\r\nand then sow to clover. I do not think windbreaks essential. For rabbits\r\nand to prevent borers I use equal parts of carbolic acid and water as a\r\nwash. I prune a little by cutting back on the north side and keeping out\r\nthe watersprouts, which I think pays. I think it pays to thin apples by\r\nhand in July and August. I have used some stable litter in the orchard,\r\nand think it pays. I pasture horses in my orchard during winter, but no\r\nstock at any other time. I spray, after blossoms fall, three times, two\r\nweeks apart, with Paris green, for the codling-moth, and my apples are\r\nquite free from worms. I dig out borers and pick off worm nests. I pick\r\nby hand in half-bushel baskets, sell at wholesale, and the buyer sorts\r\nto suit himself. I have never dried or stored any. Prices in 1896 and\r\n1897, seventy-five cents per barrel; spring of 1898, $1.25 to $1.65. I\r\nuse laborers at one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALEX.

I\r\nprefer rolling upland, black, sandy loam with porous subsoil, and a\r\nsoutheast slope. I prefer two-year-old trees; have tried root grafts and\r\nseedlings with good success. I cultivate with a diamond plow up to\r\nbearing age. Windbreaks are essential, and I would make them of ash,\r\nbox-elder, maple, and elm; I would plant either the young trees or seed.\r\nI prune with a saw, and use a chisel on watersprouts. I think it\r\nbeneficial. I thin by shaking the tree when the fruit is small. I\r\nfertilize; think it benefits the trees, by making them grow stronger,\r\nand they fruit better; think it advisable on all soils. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs, but would not advise it; does not pay. Flathead borer\r\nand fall web-worm affect my trees. I spray, as soon as the bloom falls,\r\nwith London purple. I sometimes sell my apples in the orchard, and\r\nsometimes from the cellar. I store apples in the cellar, and am\r\nsuccessful. I do not irrigate.

BEDKER, Linn, Washington county: I have lived in Kansas thirty\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 100 trees from two to twelve years old.\r\nFor market I prefer Ben Davis, and for a family orchard Winesap. I\r\nprefer bottom land with a sandy loam and a northeast aspect. I plant my\r\ntrees in squares thirty feet apart. I cultivate my orchard for three\r\nyears with a single-horse cultivator. Plant corn and potatoes in a young\r\norchard; cease cropping after four years; plant timothy and clover mixed\r\nin bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of\r\nwillows, by planting on north and south sides of the orchard. For\r\nrabbits I wrap the trees with corn-stalks in the winter, and dig the\r\nborers out. I prune my trees with a saw to make thinner; I think it\r\nbeneficial, and that it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the\r\ntrees. I do not think it would pay. I fertilize my orchard with slaked\r\nlime, and would advise it on all soils. It helps to keep off borers. I\r\ndo not pasture my orchard; do not think it advisable. My apple trees are\r\ntroubled with bud moth, twig-borer, and leaf-crumpler, and my apples\r\nwith curculio. I have sprayed when in bloom with London purple, but do\r\nnot think I have reduced the codling-moth. I pick my apples by hand, and\r\nsort into two classes--good keepers and cider apples. Put them all in\r\none pile and then sort. I prefer barrels or boxes, from three to twenty\r\nbushels; fill them full. I retail my apples. I sell the best in sacks by\r\nthe bushel.

I prefer bottom land,\r\nlimestone soil with a gravel subsoil, and a northeast or eastern slope.\r\nI prefer for planting strong, stocky yearlings--never over two years\r\nold--set at the crossing of furrows plowed with a lister. I cultivate my\r\norchard to potatoes, pumpkins, squashes, melons, or any low hoed crop. I\r\nuse an ordinary ten- or twelve-inch plow, and a five-tooth cultivator,\r\nand keep this up until they begin to bear; then seed to clover, mow it,\r\nand let it rot on the ground; then let the clover seed fall under,\r\nharrow, and let come up again. Windbreaks are beneficial; would make\r\nthem of ash and Osage orange, by planting a few rows of trees inside of\r\nthe hedge. To protect against rabbits, I wrap the trees. I prune with a\r\nsaw and knife to remove chafing and dead limbs, and to make the tree\r\nmore healthy and vigorous. I think it beneficial. I never thin the fruit\r\non the trees. I fertilize my orchard with coal and wood ashes; think it\r\nbeneficial, and would advise their use on all soils. I do not pasture my\r\norchard. My trees are troubled with canker-worm, and my apples with\r\ncodling-moth. I never have sprayed to any extent. I hand-pick my apples,\r\nin one-half bushel splint baskets; sort into two classes as soon as\r\npicked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLOW. MILLER, Perry, Jefferson county: Have lived in Kansas thirty years.\r\nHave an apple orchard of 2400 trees from one to fifteen years old. For\r\ncommercial purposes I prefer Jonathan, Missouri Pippin, and Ben Davis,\r\nand for family orchard Early Harvest, Red Winter Pearmain, Cooper's\r\nEarly White, and Rambo. I prefer bottom land, clay soil and a porous\r\nsubsoil, with a north and east slope. I prefer two-year-old, low-headed,\r\nstocky trees, planted twenty-five by thirty feet. I cultivate my orchard\r\nto corn for six years, using a plow, cultivator, and harrow, and cease\r\ncropping after six or seven years. Grow only weeds in a bearing orchard.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of maples, planted two rods\r\napart around orchard. For rabbits I keep two hounds and a shot-gun. I\r\nget after the borers with a knife. I prune with a knife to keep out\r\nwatersprouts. Never have thinned fruit on the trees. I fertilize my\r\norchard with stable litter, and think it has proven beneficial, but\r\nwould not advise its use on all soils. I pasture my orchard with horses,\r\nbut would not advise it. I doubt if it pays. My trees are troubled with\r\nborers, and my apples with codling-moth. I do not spray. Pick my apples\r\nby hand into sacks. I sort into three classes--first, second, and\r\nculls--into baskets from the ground. I sell apples in the orchard at\r\nwholesale. I market my best apples in barrels; sell second and third\r\ngrades to vinegar and cider-mills. My best market is at home. Never\r\ntried distant markets. Do not dry any. I store some apples in bulk in a\r\ncellar, and am successful. Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin keep best.\r\nPrices have been seventy-five cents to $1.50 per barrel. I employ men\r\nand boys at one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWM. GURWELL, Fanning, Doniphan county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-five years; have 5000 apple trees, planted from two to thirty\r\nyears. For commercial orchard I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, Jonathan,\r\nWhite Winter Pearmain, and Rawle's Janet; and would add for family use\r\nEarly Harvest and Dominie. Have tried and discarded Yellow Bellflower;\r\nnot prolific in this climate. I prefer hill with black loam and clay\r\nsubsoil; any slope but southwest is good. I prefer two-year-old trees,\r\nand set them in holes dug two and half to three feet square with a\r\nspade, and set the trees two or three inches deeper than they stood in\r\nthe nursery. Have tried home-grown root grafts, and was successful. I\r\ncultivate to corn, potatoes, pumpkins, and melons, using plow and\r\nharrow. I crop a bearing orchard lightly, and cease when in full\r\nbearing. I kill the rabbits. I prune with saw, knife, and clippers, and\r\nthink it beneficial. I seldom thin fruit on the trees. My trees are\r\nplanted in blocks. I fertilize the land near the trees with stable\r\nlitter; I would advise its use on thin soil. I pasture my orchard with\r\ncalves and hogs, and think it advisable; it pays in some orchards. Trees\r\nare troubled with borers; I hunt the borers with a wire. We pick\r\ncarefully in large baskets and sacks from a step-ladder; I pack in\r\nbarrels. My best market is northwest of here; I sometimes sell in the\r\norchard at wholesale, retail, and peddle; dry and make cider of the\r\nculls; never dry for market. I sometimes store a few apples, and find\r\nthe Winesap, White Winter Pearmain and Rawle's Janet keep the best. We\r\nhave to repack stored apples before marketing them. Do not irrigate.\r\nPrices have been from 60 cents to $1.25 per barrel. I employ all kinds\r\nof help, and pay one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSAMUEL H. BERT, Moonlight, Dickinson county: Have been in Kansas\r\nnineteen years; have 500 apple trees from four to twenty-two years\r\nplanted; the oldest are twelve inches in diameter. For commercial\r\npurposes use Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and Janet, and for family use\r\nwould add Red June and Maiden's Blush. Have tried and discarded Red\r\nStreak, Romanite, Rambo, and Bellflower. I prefer bottom in this\r\nlocality with a northeast slope. I plant twenty-eight or thirty feet\r\napart. I plant two-year-old trees; rather plant a yearling than\r\nthree-year-olds. Have never tried root grafts or seedlings. I cultivate\r\neven my oldest trees, using a plow and harrow; it pays. I grow corn in\r\nyoung orchard until too large; then nothing, just cultivate. Windbreaks\r\nare essential, and should be made of Osage orange or mulberries; but not\r\ntoo close to the orchard. I tie corn-stalks around the trees to protect\r\nfrom rabbits, and keep the trees low, to shade the trunks to protect\r\nagainst borers. I prune to prevent forks, to keep from splitting. I thin\r\napples when necessary; this should be done when they are about half\r\ngrown. I prefer to plant my trees in blocks. An orchard should be\r\nfertilized with fine stable litter. I would advise the use of it,\r\nespecially on upland soil. Never pasture my orchard. My trees are\r\ntroubled with flathead borers. Never sprayed much, but think it would be\r\nbeneficial. I pick in sack hung over shoulder. We make three classes of\r\nour apples--large, small, and specked. Have no particular way to market;\r\nsell any way I can, but never in the orchard. We make cider, boiled\r\ncider and apple-butter of the culls. Never have tried distant markets.\r\nNever dry any. Store some for winter in bulk and in barrels in cellar;\r\nam successful; find that the Winesaps keep best. Have never tried\r\nartificial cold storage. We have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing; lost very few this winter, as I kept them out of the cellar\r\nuntil December; then they kept well. I do not irrigate. Prices have been\r\nfrom 60 cents to $1.50 per barrel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG. E. SPOHR, Manhattan, Riley county: Have resided in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears. Have an orchard of 3000 trees, nineteen years planted. Originator\r\nof the Spohr apple (described elsewhere). Plants for commerce Winesap,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Ben Davis; for family orchard, Winesap, Missouri\r\nPippin, Maiden's Blush, and Early Harvest. Have tried fifty varieties,\r\nbut think none of them paid better than those named. I live on bottom\r\nland, eight feet to water. Any slope is good. Prefer sandy loam. Plant\r\ntwo-year-old, well-pruned trees, in large holes. Cultivate thoroughly,\r\nplanting to corn until seven years old; then seed to alfalfa. I favor\r\nwindbreaks of Scotch or Austrian pines, planted in three rows ten feet\r\napart. I believe in pruning, and always have my knife open when in the\r\norchard, and trim at all times; like to have trees, not brush piles.\r\nThe deity governing Kansas winds thins the fruit sufficiently. Apple\r\ntrees are more fruitful if varieties are mixed in planting. Use all the\r\ntwo- and three-year-old stable litter I can get. Do not pasture my\r\norchard. Spray with London purple one week before and two weeks after\r\nblooming, for canker-worm, leaf-roller, and codling-moth, and have\r\nreduced the latter by it. I hunt the borers and go after them with a hot\r\n(?) iron. Pick by hand, and sort to suit customers. Pack in eleven-peck\r\nbarrels, and mark with stencil. Sell my best apples to shippers, and\r\nmake vinegar and hog and cattle feed of culls. My best market is\r\nColorado, but I sell in orchard. I store successfully for winter in a\r\ncave in bulk, and find Winesap and Missouri Pippin the best keepers,\r\nlosing about ten per cent. Prices average fifty cents per bushel. Pay\r\nhelp from $12.50 per month to 75 cents per day and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. D. OSBORNE, Soldier, Jackson county: Have lived in the state\r\nthirty-one years; have 500 apple trees, from three to sixteen years\r\nplanted. For commercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis, York Imperial,\r\nGano, and Winesap; for family orchard, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and,\r\nfor summer, Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, and Cooper's Early White.\r\nHave tried and discarded Vandevere, as it does not bear, and Willow Twig\r\non account of blight; Rawle's Janet no good on market. I prefer hilltop\r\nif well cultivated; otherwise bottom, with a loam soil and a sandy\r\nsubsoil, and a southeast slope to protect from southwest winds. I plant\r\ntwo-year-old trees, three feet to head, not less than three limbs to\r\nform head, thirty feet each way. I cultivate with plow, harrow and spade\r\nthe square immediately surrounding the tree. I plant corn in the young\r\norchard and seed the bearing orchard to clover; cease cropping at five\r\nor six years. I think windbreaks essential on southwest, and would plant\r\nOsage orange or Russian mulberry. I wrap with grass or tarred paper to\r\nprotect from rabbits. I prune in May to spread the top and thin the\r\nfruit. I seldom thin the fruit, but it will pay to thin the last of May.\r\nI fertilize with stable litter, but would advise it only on hill\r\norchards. I pasture the orchard with hogs and horses, and think it\r\nadvisable, and that it pays. My apples are troubled with codling-moth. I\r\nspray during May, after the blossom has fallen, with kerosene emulsion,\r\nsulphate of copper, and London purple, for codling-moth, blight, and\r\ninsects generally. I think I have reduced the codling-moth. I treat\r\nborers with crude carbolic acid diluted with water. I dig around tree\r\ndown to the roots, dam outside, fill around tree with water and acid\r\nstrong enough to tingle your tongue. I hand-pick from ladders by the\r\nordinary method. Never sell in orchard; make cider of second- and\r\nthird-grade apples; feed culls to stock. My best markets are Holton and\r\nTopeka; never have tried distant markets. Never dry any. Store but few\r\napples in an orchard cave, nine feet deep, eight feet wide by\r\ntwenty-four feet long. The apples are put on shelves about ten inches\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. L. JONES, Salina, Saline county: Have lived in Kansas forty-four\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 6000 trees, planted from five to\r\ntwenty-five years. For market I prefer Missouri Pippin, Winesap,\r\nJonathan, Lowell, Cooper's Early White, Grimes's Golden Pippin, and\r\nWealthy. For family orchard would plant Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush,\r\nJonathan, Winesap, Missouri Pippin. Have tried and discarded Alexander\r\nas a shy bearer which rots on the tree. Prefer bottom land here, sandy\r\nsoil, free from clay or hard-pan. Preferable with northeast slope. Plant\r\nwell-branched two-year-old trees; turn deep cross-furrows the distance\r\nthe trees are wanted apart; cultivate in corn until the trees are five\r\nor six years old; after that use the plow and disc harrow and plant\r\nnothing. I emphatically believe that windbreaks are essential. They may\r\nbe made of anything hardy and suitable, as Osage orange, box-elder,\r\nwalnut, etc. To protect from rabbits, wrap with grass or corn-stalks. I\r\nonly prune with shears and saw, to clear the limbs off the ground a\r\nlittle. I believe stable litter is good for an orchard. I pasture very\r\nlittle, and do not think it good for an orchard. I spray as soon as the\r\nleaves start, with Paris green or London purple, mostly for canker-worm,\r\nand doubt its effect upon codling-moth. Thrifty trees are not usually\r\nbothered with borers, and unthrifty trees should be made into firewood.\r\nOur pickers use sacks with strap over the shoulder. We sort into four\r\nclasses: First, large, sound fruit; second, small sound fruit; third,\r\nslightly damaged fruit; fourth, culls. Very little packing is done here;\r\napples are usually sold to shippers in bulk. I sell my culls to hundreds\r\nof farmers in this and adjoining counties for canning, apple-butter,\r\netc. My best market is here in Salina. I have tried distant markets, but\r\nit did not pay very well. Have never dried any; stored but few for\r\nwinter in baskets and barrels. I find the Missouri Pippin, Winesap,\r\nRawle's Janet and Romanite are the best keepers. Our loss in keeping\r\nvaries with the season and the condition of the apples at picking time.\r\nHave never irrigated any. Prices during the past six years have varied\r\nfrom twenty-five to fifty cents per bushel. I use men and boys to help\r\npick and at spraying time in the spring, usually paying one dollar per\r\nday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nN. CHRISTENSEN, Mariadahl, Pottawatomie county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nforty years. Have an apple orchard of four acres, from five to\r\ntwenty-five years planted. For all purposes I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Winesap. I prefer second-bottom land with a black loam, a\r\nclay subsoil, and a northeast slope. I prefer good two-year-old trees\r\nplanted thirty feet apart, alternated with peaches. I have cultivated my\r\norchard to corn, but do not think it advisable. I used a plow,\r\ncultivator and disc for eight years. I have cultivated the young orchard\r\nboth ways twelve times, and shall keep on with the disc and harrow. I\r\ncease cropping after six or eight years, and then grow alfalfa.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential. I use wire-cloth as a protection against\r\nrabbits; I would not risk an apple or pear tree without it. I prune with\r\na knife, saw and shears when the trees are young; I think it beneficial,\r\nas it makes the trees healthier. I fertilize my orchard with stable\r\nlitter; I spread it all over the ground and then harrow it in. I pasture\r\nmy orchard with calves after it is six or eight years old and has been\r\nseeded to grass; I think it pays in an old orchard. My trees are\r\ntroubled with tent-caterpillars and borers. I have not sprayed yet, but\r\nthink I shall this spring with Bordeaux mixture. I pick my apples by\r\nhand; sort into two classes. I feed my second and third grades and culls\r\nto the calves and hogs; have made cider of them, but could not find\r\nmarket for it. I have tried shipping apples to distant markets, but it\r\ndid not pay. I dry some apples for home use, using stove and sun;\r\nneither way is satisfactory. I store my best apples in bulk in a cellar\r\nunder the house; am not very successful; I find Ben Davis and Winesap\r\nkeep the best. Prices have been from twenty-five to fifty cents per\r\nbushel.

ROBERTS, Perry, Jefferson county: I have lived in Kansas since\r\n1859; have an apple orchard from four to twenty-eight years old. For a\r\ncommercial orchard I prefer Jonathan, Ben Davis, Winesap, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Maiden's Blush; and for a family orchard Red June, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Jonathan, Winesap, and Rawle's Janet. I prefer midland altitude\r\nor bottom, with a rich loam and a clay subsoil, and a northeast slope.\r\nI prefer two-year-old trees with upright heads, set 30x40 feet in\r\nsquares. I cultivate my trees with a plow and cultivator until they\r\noccupy most of the ground. I plant corn and potatoes in a young orchard,\r\nand cease cropping when the size of the trees renders it impossible. I\r\nseed the bearing orchard to red clover. Windbreaks are not essential; a\r\nhedge fence is all that is necessary, and this ought not to be nearer\r\nthan forty feet of the trees. For rabbits I wrap the trees; and dig the\r\nborers out with a knife. I prune sparingly with a knife or sharp ax to\r\nremove all dead or injured limbs; I think it pays. I thin the fruit when\r\nthe trees are overloaded, by taking off one-half after they are the size\r\nof marbles. My trees are planted in blocks for convenience in picking. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with all the barn-yard litter I can get, scattered\r\nbroadcast; would advise its use on all soils unless already very rich. I\r\nam sorry to confess I have pastured my orchard with hogs; it is not\r\nadvisable. My trees are troubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar,\r\nroot aphis, roundhead borers, and buffalo tree-hopper; and my apples\r\nwith codling-moth, curculio, and gouger. I have sprayed just as the buds\r\nopen for canker-worm; have also sprayed for codling-moth. I pick all the\r\napples I can reach from the ground in baskets, and the rest from ladders\r\ninto sacks; I handle very carefully. I sort into two classes from a\r\ntable as they come from the trees; pack in eleven-peck barrels for fall\r\nuse, and twelve-peck barrels for winter use, carefully shaken and\r\npressed; mark with the grade and name of variety and haul to market on\r\nwagon. I always sell in the orchard by car lots, when I can. I retail\r\nthe scattered ones; send the third grade to the cider-mills. My best\r\nmarkets are sometimes both east and west of here. I never ship to\r\ncommission men; it don't pay. I don't dry nor store any. I do not\r\nirrigate. I employ men and boys (men preferred).

Have an apple orchard of 775 trees four years old.\r\nFor market I prefer Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Willow Twig, and for\r\nfamily orchard Yellow Transparent, Maiden's Blush, and Jonathan. I\r\nprefer a loose, porous subsoil on a north slope. I prefer one- or\r\ntwo-year-old trees, set twenty-two feet apart north and south and\r\nthirty-three feet east and west. I plant my orchard to corn, potatoes,\r\nand clover, and keep up the cultivation until they are bearing well,\r\nusing a diamond plow and one-horse cultivator. I never cease cropping.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential, but if they were I should make them of\r\nfour or five rows of maple or some quick-growing trees, on the south and\r\nwest sides of the orchard. For rabbits I use wooden tree wrappers, and\r\ndig the borers out. I prune to give the tree shape and let in the sun; I\r\nthink it pays, as it keeps the tree from overbearing. I do not thin the\r\nfruit while on the trees, but think it would pay. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith barn-yard litter, and would advise it on all soils when it needs\r\nit. I pasture my orchard with hogs; I think it advisable, and that it\r\npays. My trees are troubled with canker-worms, tent-caterpillars,\r\nborers, tree-hoppers, and leaf-rollers, and my apples with codling-moth\r\nand curculio. I do not spray. I hand-pick my apples into buckets and\r\nsacks from step-ladders. I sell my apples in the orchard at wholesale. I\r\nsell the best to shippers, and the second and third grades the best way\r\nI can. I sell or feed the culls to the stock. Never tried distant\r\nmarkets. I do not dry any. Some years I am successful in storing apples\r\nin barrels and boxes in a cellar. Winesap and Missouri Pippin keep best.\r\nI never tried artificial cold storage. I have to repack stored apples\r\nbefore marketing, losing about one-fourth of them.

Have tried and discarded Yellow Bellflower, Lawver, Willow\r\nTwig, and Smith's Cider; the former is barren, the others blight. I\r\nprefer second bottom with northeast slope; soil loose, black loam, with\r\nred clay subsoil. I plant in furrows each way, 16x30 feet, running a\r\nsubsoiler in the furrows, and use straight, smooth, two-year-old trees.\r\nHave tried root grafts, but they need nursery care at first. I cultivate\r\nat all ages, while young with plow, and old orchard with reversible\r\ndisc. I grow corn in young orchard, and after five or six years keep the\r\nground bare with the disc. I think windbreaks essential, and use Osage\r\norange, elm, ash, Austrian pine, and cedars. Catch the rabbits; and\r\ncultivate well as a protection from borers. Do not prune much; take out\r\na little brush if necessary to more readily reach the fruit. Never have\r\nthinned apples. Have never fertilized, and am decidedly opposed to\r\npasturing orchards with any kind of stock. Am troubled with canker-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, flathead borer, woolly aphis, twig-borer, fall\r\nweb-worm, leaf-roller, leaf-crumbler, and codling-moth. Spray regularly\r\nwith London purple; cannot say it has reduced the codling-moth any; for\r\nborers I keep my trees thrifty by constant cultivation. We pick in candy\r\npails, but find it bruises the fruit too much. I sort by hand in three\r\nclasses, commercial size Nos. 1 and 2, and culls. I pack in three-bushel\r\nbarrels, stenciled with name of variety and grower, and ship by freight.\r\nSell any way I can; have never sold in the orchard; sell culls for\r\napple-butter, and make some cider; have marketed at good prices at\r\nPueblo, Colo.; have never dried any for market. I store some for winter\r\nin boxes, barrels and in bulk in a cellar, and find that Ben Davis and\r\nMissouri Pippin keep best. I usually have to sort over those kept\r\nthrough, and lose perhaps one-fifth. Have never irrigated. My average\r\nreturns are about fifty cents per bushel.

For commerce he\r\nuses Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Jonathan, and for family use would\r\nadd Maiden's Blush, Grimes's Golden Pippin, and Rawle's Janet. Has\r\ndiscarded Rambo as too shy a bearer. Prefers light soil, with a heavy\r\nsubsoil in the bottom, with a southern slope. Plants thirty feet apart\r\neach way. Grows no crop in orchard, and cultivates with stirring plow\r\nand cultivator until the trees completely shade the ground. Believes\r\nwindbreaks necessary, and would plant box-elder, three feet apart, in\r\nrows three feet apart, so as to shut out all wind. Binds with\r\ncorn-stalks to protect against rabbits. Prunes by cutting off lower\r\nlimbs and thinning center; says it is beneficial, and makes fruit larger\r\nand of better color. Thins apples on trees when the size of marbles, and\r\nbelieves it pays. On pollination he says: \"I had one tree that stood\r\nalone, and never bore fruit until I got honey-bees; then it bore all\r\nright.\" Uses no fertilizers. Allows no live stock in the orchard. Has\r\nsprayed just after the blossom fell, with London purple and Bordeaux\r\nmixture, for the last five years, and it has reduced codling-moth. Uses\r\nknife and soap-suds for borers. Picks and sorts into three\r\nclasses--sound and big, medium and affected, and culls. Sells in orchard\r\nand in Salina; makes vinegar and hog feed of culls. Never shipped any\r\napples. Stores for winter by burying in bulk, and is successful. The\r\nMissouri Pippin and Rawle's Janet keep best. Prices from fifty to\r\nseventy-five cents per bushel.

WILLIAMS, Holton, Jackson county: I have lived in the state forty\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 225 trees of various ages, the oldest\r\nbeing thirty-nine years. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinesap, and Jonathan; and for a family orchard Red Astrachan, Early\r\nHarvest, Dominie, Lowell, and Winesap. Have tried thirty varieties and\r\ndiscarded all excepting the above mentioned. I prefer a rich soil with a\r\nporous subsoil and a north slope; can see little difference between\r\nhilltop and bottom orchards. I prefer two-year-old trees, with\r\nsymmetrical form, for setting; when planting I trim all affected roots\r\nand prune lightly; set them inclined to the southwest. I cultivate my\r\norchard as long as it lives with a plow and harrow--plow shallow; plant\r\nthe young orchard to potatoes, beans, vines, and sometimes corn, using a\r\none-horse diamond plow, and am careful to harrow afterward. I cease\r\ncropping six or seven years after setting, and plant a bearing orchard\r\nto red clover. I think windbreaks are essential; would make them of most\r\nany kind of rapid-growing trees planted in groves on the east and south\r\nsides of the orchard. For rabbits I wrap the trees, and dig the borers\r\nout. I prune with a penknife to keep the trees in good shape. It pays if\r\nproperly done, and is not too severe. I have thinned my fruit by hand\r\nwhen of the size of hickory-nuts. Think trees do best in mixed\r\nplantings. I fertilize my orchard with barn-yard litter and ashes; I\r\nthink it beneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs part of a day at a time when the apples fall badly.\r\nDon't let them in at will. I think it pays and is advisable, for they\r\ndestroy the moth. My trees are troubled with both round- and flathead\r\nborers, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray, using a hand sprayer,\r\nwith Bordeaux mixture and London purple, when the blossom falls, for\r\ncodling-moth and curculio. It has not been beneficial. I burn the [tent]\r\ncaterpillars. I pick my apples by hand in a sack over the shoulder, and\r\nsort into three classes--first, finest; second, fair; third, culls. I\r\nsort from the ground or a table. I sell apples in the orchard, wholesale\r\nand retail, and have no trouble in selling my first-grade apples. I sell\r\nand make cider of the second and third grades, and also dry some of\r\nthem. Feed the culls to hogs or other stock. My best market is at home.\r\nWe dry some in a common dry-house which is very satisfactory; after they\r\nare dry we put them into sacks to keep from millers; we find a market\r\nfor them, but it does not pay well. I am fairly successful in storing\r\napples on shallow shelves in the cellar; Winesap and Rawle's Janet keep\r\nbest. I do not irrigate. Apples have been about fifty cents per bushel,\r\nand dried apples three to five cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nANDREW SWANSON, Dwight, Morris county: I have resided in Kansas\r\nseventeen years, and have an apple orchard of 1800 trees eight years\r\nold, eight to ten feet tall. For market I prefer Winesap, Ben Davis, and\r\nMissouri Pippin; and for family orchard would add Jonathan and Maiden's\r\nBlush. I have tried and discarded Rome Beauty, Huntsman's Favorite, and\r\nMinkler. I do not like them. I have upland, with a poor soil and a gumbo\r\nsubsoil, with a north and east aspect. I prefer two-year-old trees, set\r\nthirty feet apart each way. I cultivate my orchard with a stirring plow,\r\nand intend to keep it up as long as I live; plant corn or any cultivated\r\ncrop in the young orchard, and cease when there is no room; plant\r\nnothing in the bearing orchard. I think a hedge fence all around the\r\norchard as a windbreak would be beneficial. For rabbits, I wrap the\r\ntrees with wire screening, and leave it on. I prune my trees every\r\nwinter, or when I have time, to thin the top and to give shape; I think\r\nit pays, and is very beneficial. I do not thin my fruit--the wind does\r\nthat for me. I fertilize my orchard, and think it beneficial, and would\r\nadvise it on all soils. I do not pasture my orchard; it is not\r\nadvisable and does not pay. My trees are troubled with leaf-rollers and\r\nother insects. I give the culls to hogs. I am successful in storing\r\napples in bulk in an arched cellar; Winesap, Ben Davis and Missouri\r\nPippin keep best. I never tried artificial cold storage. I do not\r\nirrigate. Price has been seventy-five cents per bushel; dried apples\r\neight to ten cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF. B. HARRIS, White City, Morris county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-five-years, and have an orchard of 800 trees, planted from ten to\r\nfifteen years ago. For commercial purposes I prefer Maiden's Blush,\r\nCooper's Early White, Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin. For a\r\nfamily orchard I would put out the same, adding Red June, Jonathan, and\r\nSmith's Cider. I have discarded the Willow Twig, as it rots too easily.\r\nI prefer hilltop, north slope, soil as deep as possible, and a gumbo\r\nsubsoil. Would plant two-year-old trees with perfect crown growth,\r\ntwenty feet north and south, thirty feet east and west. My last\r\nplanting, ten years ago, was of root grafts, and I like it first rate. I\r\ngrow corn in the orchard for about ten years, then nothing. I cultivate\r\nthoroughly, plowing until the soil is doubled, and then use the disc\r\npulverizer. I believe windbreaks to be very, very, very essential, and\r\nwould make of Osage orange on the outside, and any quick-growing\r\nforest-tree next to the orchard. For protection against rabbits, I tie\r\nwith weeds and twine. I prune with a jackknife, a two-inch thin-bladed\r\nchisel, and mallet. It does pay, and is beneficial until the trees are\r\nten years old. I tried thinning, but it proved more injury than profit.\r\nI use all the fertilizer from stables and stock-yards that I can get,\r\nspread all over the ground, and believe it would pay on any soil. I\r\nwould allow no live stock in the orchard but poultry, and would not\r\nallow them to roost in the trees.\r\n\r\nI have some trouble with tent-caterpillars, roundheaded borers, fall\r\nweb-worm, and curculio. I spray with London purple, first when the bloom\r\nfalls, then every ten days until three times, with a spray pump, using\r\nLondon purple. I do not know whether I have reduced the codling-moth any\r\nor not. I treat the borers with penknife and probe, others with rough\r\nhandling--eternal, vigilant destruction. I pick from step-ladders into\r\npails; place in sack to haul to the barn or shed. We sort into two\r\nclasses--first, all sound and marketable, second for cider. I sort by\r\nhand from the pile, three or four bushels at a time. We pack in\r\nbushel-and-a-half sacks, filled from the half-bushel measure, mark with\r\nthe name of variety, and haul to market in spring wagon. I retail and\r\npeddle them, making the culls into cider and vinegar. My best market is\r\nour nearest town; tried distant market last fall and it paid. We dry\r\nsome, pack into tight boxes as soon as dried and store in dark place,\r\nand find a ready market at the stores at six cents per pound. It does\r\nnot pay very well, but saves waste. I only store for family use, in\r\nheadless barrels; generally keep well. Ben Davis keeps the best. We lose\r\nfrom one-fourth to one-half. I believe irrigation would be a good thing.\r\nPrices have been from thirty-five cents to seventy-five cents per\r\nbushel. Use only home help.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. D. WELTNER, Westmoreland, Pottawatomie county: Have been in Kansas\r\neighteen years. Planted 800 apple trees ten years ago. I do not own this\r\norchard at present. I planted Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Winesap,\r\nJonathan, and Maiden's Blush. I prefer sandy or black loam, with clay\r\nsubsoil, bottom land or gentle slope to the north. I set good, thrifty,\r\nclean, two-year-old trees. I thoroughly plow my ground, then run a\r\nlister for the row, and throw out with spade or shovel where the trees\r\nare to go. I cultivate with potatoes and corn, using the plow, harrow,\r\nand five-tooth cultivator, until ten or twelve years old, then sow to\r\nclover. I use no windbreaks. For rabbits I wrap with building paper or\r\nwire screen. I believe it pays to prune with the knife and saw a little\r\neach year, to train the tree to grace, beauty, and profit. I never tried\r\nthinning fruit. Would fertilize with a little stable litter spread over\r\nthe ground. Never would pasture an orchard. Had some canker-worm and\r\ncurculio, but never tried spraying. I pick from a step-ladder into a\r\nshoulder sack.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nV. E. HATHAWAY, Council Grove, Morris county: Have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty years; have an orchard of 1000 trees two to twelve inches in\r\ndiameter. Have tried and discarded Willow Twig and Smith's Cider on\r\naccount of blight. I prefer a gravel or clay bottom with northern slope.\r\nI prefer healthy trees set forty by twenty feet. I cultivate my orchard\r\nto corn until too large, plowing very shallow. Windbreaks are\r\nbeneficial; would make them of cedar. I prune by cutting out the inner\r\nlimbs that rub; I think it pays. I do not thin the fruit on the trees. I\r\nsometimes fertilize with stable litter; would advise its use on all\r\nsoils. I do not pasture my orchard; do not think it advisable. My trees\r\nare troubled with canker-worm, and my fruit by codling-moth. I spray\r\njust after the blooms fall with London purple, and think I have reduced\r\nthe codling-moth. I dig out insects not affected by spraying. I pick my\r\nfruit from inside of tree from a ladder. Sort into three classes. Pack\r\nin apple barrels, pressed down, and marked with the quality; then\r\ntransport to market on a wagon. I wholesale, retail, and peddle;\r\nsometimes sell in the orchard. Feed the culls to hogs. My best market is\r\nat home; never tried distant markets. Do not dry any. I store apples in\r\nboxes or barrels, and am successful. I find Missouri Pippin, Winesap and\r\nBen Davis keep best. We have to repack stored apples before marketing,\r\nand lose about one-eighth or one-tenth. I do not irrigate.

MARTY, Longford, Clay county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-eight\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 200 trees from seven to fifteen years\r\nold, eight to ten inches in diameter. Have tried and discarded Grimes's\r\nGolden Pippin and Willow Twig. I prefer sandy bottom, loam soil, with a\r\nnorth or northeast aspect. I prefer two-year-old, low, stocky trees, set\r\nin rows thirty-six feet each way. Have tried root grafts with very good\r\nsuccess. I cultivate my trees eight years; first four to potatoes, using\r\na disc harrow; plow shallow among young trees; plant nothing in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of Osage\r\norange and box-elder on both south and west sides of the orchard. I trap\r\nand shoot the rabbits. I prune very little; only cut out the branches\r\nthat interfere. I fertilize my orchard with barn-yard litter; I think it\r\nbeneficial. I do not pasture my orchard; do not think it advisable. Do\r\nnot spray. Sort into two classes: good and bad.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. L. STEELE, Minneapolis, Ottawa county: Have lived in Kansas fourteen\r\nyears.

I plant\r\ntwo-year-old trees branched near the ground, in deep furrows made by\r\nplow. Have tried root grafts with good success. I cultivate with corn\r\nand potatoes, using disc and harrow all the time; plant nothing in\r\nbearing orchard; cease cropping when about eight or ten years old.\r\nWindbreaks are essential, on the south; would make them of honey-locust,\r\ntwo or three feet apart in the row. I wrap the tree with corn-stalks to\r\nprotect from rabbits. Have not been troubled with borers. I only prune\r\nout the limbs that interfere with others. Never thin apples. I fertilize\r\nwith stable litter, and think it beneficial; would advise its use on\r\nall soils. I do not pasture my orchard; it does not pay. My trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worm. I spray with London purple when the worms\r\nfirst begin their work, to kill leaf-eating insects; do not think I have\r\nreduced the codling-moth. I irrigate with a 4-1/2-inch-cylinder pump and\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. C.

I prefer for family orchard Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, Winesap, and Rawle's Janet. I prefer hilltop with deep\r\nsoil and red subsoil, and an eastern slope. I prefer three-year-old\r\ntrees, set 24x30 feet, as deep as they were in the nursery. I cultivate\r\nin buckwheat for eight years with the plow; after that plant nothing.\r\nWindbreaks are essential on the southwest or north and south; would make\r\nthem of Osage orange; plant them forty feet distant and do not trim. For\r\nrabbits I wrap with corn-stalks and leave them on summer and winter. I\r\nprune with a saw; then cover the wound with wax; I think it beneficial.\r\nHave never thinned fruit. Never use fertilizer; do not think it\r\nadvisable. Do not pasture my orchard; would not advise it. My trees are\r\naffected with twig-borer and leaf-roller. The codling-moth troubles my\r\napples.

I prefer bottom land,\r\nwith black loam and clay subsoil. I prefer three-year-old trees, good,\r\nsmooth bark, and three or four branches. Have tried root grafts and\r\nseedlings with good success. I cultivate in corn, using plow for\r\nthirteen years; plow toward the trees one year, then away the next.\r\nWindbreaks are essential, and I would make them of cottonwood, box-elder\r\nor catalpa planted in rows on the north side. Am not troubled with\r\nrabbits or borers. I prune with a saw and knife, to produce better\r\nfruit; I think it beneficial. I fertilize with stable litter and wood\r\nashes; I would advise its use on all soils. I pasture my orchard with\r\nhogs; think it advisable, and that it pays. My trees are troubled some\r\nwith insects; codling-moth troubles my apples. I pick my apples by hand\r\ninto a basket, then sort and put in the cellar. I sort into two classes,\r\ngood and bad; we sort as we pick them. I sell my apples at home and in\r\ntown, sometimes in orchard; retail, wholesale, or peddle. Make cider for\r\nvinegar of culls. My best market is Clifton; never tried distant\r\nmarkets. Never dry any.

Planted two-year-old trees,\r\ntwenty-four by thirty feet, on a southern slope. Cultivate in corn for\r\nten years and then sow to clover. I prune only to keep the watersprouts\r\nfrom bothering the tree. I believe fertilizing pays, although I have not\r\ntried it. I never allow any stock but poultry in the orchard. I spray\r\nafter the bloom has fallen, and ten days later, with Paris green, to\r\ndestroy the codling-moth. We sort out only one grade, allowing the culls\r\nto rot. We pack in three-bushel barrels, and usually sell in the orchard\r\nat wholesale. Our best market is Minneapolis, Minn., but I have not made\r\nshipping pay. I have tried artificial cold storage; they did not keep\r\nsatisfactorily, I do not know why. I had to repack, and lost over twenty\r\nper cent. Prices have varied from 75 cents to $1.50 per barrel.

HAZEN, Leona, Doniphan county: Have been in Kansas forty years;\r\nhave an apple orchard of 13,200 trees; 10,000 have been planted fourteen\r\nyears, and 3200 for two years. I would plant nothing but Ben Davis for\r\ncommercial purposes. For the family orchard I would add Winesap,\r\nJonathan, and Rawle's Janet. Prefer rather high land, well underdrained,\r\nwith a northeast slope. I plant good two-year-old trees, in rows two\r\nrods apart east and west, and the trees one rod apart in the row north\r\nand south. I grow corn or potatoes for six years, then seed down to\r\nclover. I cultivate the trees while young with a small one-horse plow. I\r\nthink windbreaks essential on the south and west sides; Osage orange is\r\ngood, set the same as for a fence, and allowed to grow tall. I wrap my\r\ntrees against rabbits, and try all ways to destroy them. I prune with\r\nthe saw to get the trees up so I can get around them, and believe it\r\npays, or I would not do it. Have been at it fifteen years, and see no\r\nharm. Don't think it would pay to thin apples on the trees. I believe it\r\nis better to mix varieties in the orchard; I have 7000 Ben Davis and 300\r\nWinesaps in one orchard, and where the Winesaps are mixed with the Davis\r\nthe trees are always fuller. I believe fertilizing would be good, but my\r\norchard is too large to practice it. I pasture with horses in the\r\nspring, and believe it does no harm, and that it pays.\r\n\r\nCanker-worm is my worst insect pest, and I have been spraying for many\r\nyears, using one pound of London purple to 160 gallons of water. I spray\r\nwhen the blossoms fall, using a big tank and a small engine to pump. I\r\ncannot say that I have reduced the codling-moth any by spraying. I cut\r\nborers out. I sort into two classes, No. 1's and No. 2's, bests and\r\nsecond bests; best ones go into firsts, and those that are not rotten in\r\nNo. 2. I have a table, or what I call a culler; the apples are picked\r\nand put into these cullers; I have twelve men to each culler and a boss\r\nover them. They stand and cull the apples. I have the cullers numbered,\r\nso if any one puts up bad apples I can catch him. I use barrels for the\r\nNo. 1's; fill and press so they will not shake. I put them up in good\r\nshape, and sell at wholesale to the first buyer that comes. I ship my\r\nculls and second-grade apples to western Kansas and to Nebraska in cars\r\nin bulk. I never send to commission men. I have never tried drying, or\r\nstoring apples for winter. For family use I put away some in barrels,\r\nand keep the above varieties successfully. Prices, last year, two\r\ndollars per barrel; a year ago, one dollar per barrel; two years ago,\r\n$1.50 per barrel.

For\r\nplanting I prefer two-year-old whips. I cultivate my orchard to potatoes\r\nor any hoed crop, when it is first planted; keep this up as long as the\r\nroots and branches will admit. I have used a disc and common drag harrow\r\nfor the last three years. I plant my bearing orchard to clover. I prune\r\nmy trees with a pruning knife and saw when necessary. I fertilize my\r\norchard with thoroughly rotted stable litter. I think it beneficial and\r\nwould advise its use on all soils. I have pastured eight acres of my\r\norchard with calves; have not seen any injury. I sort my apples into\r\nthree classes--first, second, and culls. I sell my apples to neighbors,\r\nrestaurants, stores, etc. The culls I dry, make cider, feed to pigs,\r\nand give away. Clifton is my best market; have never tried distant\r\nmarkets.

Prefer for market Ben Davis and Winesap; for family\r\nuse, many kinds. Have discarded Rawle's Janet, Early Pennock,\r\nBellflower, and Russets. I prefer limestone soil; bottom land with\r\nnorthern slope. I plant two-year-old, straight-bodied, thrifty looking,\r\nlive trees. I cultivate in corn, with riding plow, for six years, and\r\nthen seed to grass. I believe a windbreak is essential, and would make\r\nit of Osage orange, maple, or cottonwood. I prevent rabbits and borers\r\nby painting with ashes and lime. I prune with saw and knife to make\r\nlarger apples, and give them better color, and think it pays. I do not\r\nthin, and would put fertilizer from the barn-yard on the land. I pasture\r\nmy orchard with cattle and hogs, but do not think it advisable. I am\r\ntroubled some with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, root aphis, borers,\r\ncodling-moth, and curculio, but do not spray. I gather only the best by\r\nhand, and put them immediately in a bin in the cellar. I sell to stores,\r\nuse plenty at home, make cider, and feed the hogs on culls. My best\r\nmarket is Seneca, Kan. Have never tried drying apples. I store for\r\nwinter on shallow shelves, six inches deep and two feet wide, in a dry\r\ncellar, and keep them successfully; Ben Davis and Winesap keep the best.\r\nPrices have ranged from twenty-five to seventy-five cents per bushel.

I plant two-year-olds with a fair amount of large roots, in\r\nfurrows made with a lister, and enlarged with a spade where necessary. I\r\ncultivate with a disc harrow as long as possible, and grow nothing on\r\nthe ground among the trees. I believe windbreaks are essential, and\r\nwould make them by planting Osage orange, Russian mulberry and\r\nbox-elders in rows six feet apart. I do not prune much; only thin out\r\ninside shoots to prevent contact. I believe it pays to thin the fruit\r\nsome when the apples are perhaps half grown. I use no fertilizers. I do\r\nnot pasture my orchard. I spray a little before the buds swell, after\r\nthe blossoms fall, and two weeks later, with Bordeaux mixture, to\r\nprevent wormy apples.

I plant my orchard to corn for\r\nfour years and use an eight-tooth cultivator; cease cropping when the\r\ntrees are four or six inches in diameter; plant clover in a bearing\r\norchard. Windbreaks are not essential in this locality. For rabbits I\r\nwrap the trees, and dig the borers out. I prune when the trees are young\r\nto thin the top; I think it beneficial and that it pays. I do not thin\r\nthe fruit while on the trees, but would advise doing so when the fruit\r\nis one-third grown.

TAYLOR, Eskridge, Wabaunsee county: Have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-eight years. Have 1400 apple trees, five to fifteen years old,\r\nsix to twelve inches in diameter. For market I grow Ben Davis, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Jonathan; for family orchard I would advise Winesap, Rawle's\r\nJanet, Cooper's Early White, Maiden's Blush, and Jonathan; and I would\r\ndiscard nearly all others. I prefer bottom land, with black loam and\r\nopen subsoil, north slope. Would plant one- or two-year-old, low-top\r\ntrees, twenty-five feet apart each way. I have grown root grafts with\r\nsuccess. I shall cultivate as long as the trees live, growing corn among\r\nthem until the growth of the trees prevents it. I believe all the\r\nwindbreak necessary is an ordinary fence. I use traps for the rabbits\r\nand a knife for the borers. I thin the fruit on the trees in the early\r\nsummer, after they are well set. I believe barn-yard fertilizer\r\nbeneficial to any orchard. I pasture my orchard with hogs, and think it\r\nadvisable, and that it pays. I have some insects, but do not spray; I\r\nburn some. I pick by hand in half-bushel baskets; sort into two classes,\r\nmarket and cider; pack into barrels, and usually sell in the orchard at\r\nwholesale. Never shipped to a distant market. Do not dry any. Have\r\nstored some for winter in the cellar in bulk, and find that the Missouri\r\nPippin, Winesap and Rawle's Janet keep the best. I do not irrigate.\r\nPrice averages about twenty-five cents per bushel. I use ordinary farm\r\nhands at fifteen to twenty dollars per month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRANK SEIFERT, Strawberry, Washington county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-eight years; have an apple orchard of 150 trees, from three to\r\ntwenty years planted. For commercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Winesap, and for family orchard would add Maiden's\r\nBlush. Have tried and discarded Willow Twig on account of blight. I\r\nprefer limestone upland with an eastern aspect. I prefer three-year-old\r\ntrees for planting. I cultivate my orchard for eight or ten years with a\r\nplow and harrow. I seed bearing orchard to red clover. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of one row of box-elder and two rows of\r\nplums. I fertilize my orchard with straw and hay, and think it\r\nadvisable, on all soils. I never pasture my orchard; it is not\r\nadvisable. I do not spray. I pick my apples the old way. [?] Sell my\r\napples in the orchard. I sometimes store for winter in bulk in an arched\r\ncellar, and am successful. I find the Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin and\r\nWinesap keep equally well. Prices have been from fifty to seventy-five\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. T. TRAVIS, Aurora, Cloud county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of seventy-five trees from five to twenty\r\nyears old. I prefer low land, black loam soil with clay subsoil, and a\r\nnorthern slope. I prefer two-year-old trees, straight, with no forks,\r\nthe limbs low down, planted in furrows made by a plow. I cultivate my\r\norchard as long as I can get through it, with potatoes and sweet corn,\r\nusing a harrow often enough to keep weeds down and ground smooth. Cease\r\ncropping when the trees get too large for sweet corn to do any good.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of Russian mulberry, planted\r\nin two or three rows, eight to ten feet apart, on all sides of the\r\norchard. I prune little, only enough to thin out the tops and keep limbs\r\nfrom rubbing each other, and to give light. I fertilize my old orchard\r\nwith any kind of coarse stable litter; I pile it in heaps between the\r\ntrees and let it lay until it rots. I pasture my orchard with hogs when\r\nit grows to wild rye and is too large for me to plow; I think it\r\nadvisable only when the trees get foul; it pays if not pastured with too\r\nmany and they are not kept on too long. My trees are troubled with\r\nleaf-roller, and my apples with codling-moth. I have sprayed, but only\r\nto a limited extent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSAM KIMBLE, Manhattan, Riley county: Have been in Kansas thirty-eight\r\nyears. Have an orchard of 2500 trees not yet in bearing. They have been\r\nplanted three, four and five years. I have set out for market Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Winesap, and for family use about thirty kinds, in\r\nvariety. I am located on upland, with clay subsoil, mainly northwest\r\nslope. I planted three-year-old trees, stocky and low headed, in holes\r\ntwenty-five by thirty feet apart, getting on my knees to work the soil\r\nin about the roots. I crop to corn, cultivating well, and shall keep\r\nthis up as long as three rows can be fairly grown between two rows of\r\ntrees. I believe in plowing if you do not get too close to the trees.\r\nWhen my orchard comes into bearing I shall keep up the cultivation but\r\ngrow no crop. I believe windbreaks are very desirable, and should make\r\nthem of cottonwood, elms, or any quick-growing forest-trees. To keep off\r\nrabbits I tie on corn-stalks with binder twine. I prune carefully to\r\nshorten the heads and keep down watersprouts, and believe it beneficial.\r\nI believe thinning will pay when the fruit sets too thickly. I believe\r\nin lots of fertilization, and use all the stable litter I can get; I\r\ndon't think you can use too much. I believe that young calves might be\r\npastured to advantage in an old orchard. Have not sprayed any, and\r\ndepend on rains for water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. B. STARNS, Fairmount, Leavenworth county: Have lived in the state\r\nforty-one years; have 1800 apple trees, extra large, seventeen years\r\nold. Planted for market Ben Davis, Winesap, Jonathan, and Missouri\r\nPippin; and for early use Early Harvest, Cooper's Early White, Maiden's\r\nBlush, and the Gennettan. Have discarded the Red June as too small and\r\nfalling too badly. My ground is black loam upland, sloping north and\r\neast. I planted two-year-old trees in furrows made by the plow, twenty\r\nby thirty-two feet. Would cultivate in corn for five years, using the\r\nbreaking-plow and cultivator; then sow to clover. Windbreaks are not\r\nnecessary here. I trap the rabbits. For borers I bank around the trees\r\nin May, and take it away in September; this exposes the tree, and the\r\nborers are taken out easily with a knife. I prune some, and think it\r\npays to take off watersprouts and shape the tree a little. Do not thin,\r\nand do not fertilize. I pasture in the spring and fall, after the apples\r\nare gathered, with pigs; it is an experiment. I have some\r\ntent-caterpillar, twig-borer, and codling-moth. Have never sprayed any.\r\nI pick in sacks and baskets, emptying into bushel boxes, which are\r\nhauled on wagons made for that purpose, to the place for packing. I make\r\nthree grades: shippers, seconds, and cider or driers. The boxes are\r\ntaken from the wagon and culled, and shippers packed in barrels; the\r\nrest are put in piles, which are afterward culled, and the seconds put\r\nby themselves. We mark barrels with name of variety, and haul to market\r\non wagons made for the purpose. We often sell at wholesale in the\r\norchard; we sell the seconds in bulk. My best market is Leavenworth;\r\nhave never shipped any away. Have never dried any, and do not store any\r\nfor winter. Prices have ranged from 50 cents to $1.75 per barrel. I use\r\nmen only, and pay $1.50 per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD. N. BARNS, Leavenworth, Leavenworth county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-seven years; have 2000 apple trees twenty years old. The best for\r\ncommercial purposes is New York Pippin [Ben Davis]. For family orchard I\r\nprefer Jonathan, Winesap, Minkler, Huntsman's Favorite, and Lowell. I\r\nhave tried and discarded Nonesuch. I prefer bottom land, with black loam\r\nsoil and clay subsoil, with south slope, in my locality. I plant good,\r\nstout, thrifty trees, two to three years old, sixteen and one-half by\r\nthirty-three feet apart. I cultivate until the trees are large enough to\r\nshade the ground. In the young orchard, for the first seven or eight\r\nyears, I usually grow corn, wheat, or oats; in a bearing orchard I grow\r\norchard-grass and timothy and clover, separate or together. I have not\r\nyet ceased cropping. I believe windbreaks are essential, made of hills,\r\ntrees, or hedge fence. For this purpose I would advise to first find the\r\nhills; then plant the orchard and trees or hedge. I dig out the borers,\r\nand trap or shoot the rabbits. I believe it pays to prune some to get\r\nrid of surplus wood. I believe it pays to thin apples and I do it in\r\nJuly. I fertilize by pasturing with cows, and believe it pays. Am\r\ntroubled with some insects, but have never sprayed. We pick from a\r\nladder, each man carrying two baskets; we sort into two classes on a\r\ntable. In the first class we put apples not damaged too much and large\r\nenough, and in the other we place the small ones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. F. RUHLIN, Wetmore, Nemaha county: Has been in Kansas seventeen\r\nyears. Owns an apple orchard of 1150 trees, set out from one to three\r\nyears. Set Ben Davis, Jonathan, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and for family\r\norchard would add the Maiden's Blush, Rambo, Rome Beauty, and Grimes's\r\nGolden Pippin. Has discarded Early Harvest, Red June, and Red Astrachan.\r\nWants upland always, north or northeast slope if possible, and a loose,\r\nfriable soil, with gravelly subsoil. On planting, he says he uses\r\ntwo-year-old, short, stocky trees with bushy tops and lots of roots,\r\nwhich he prunes back at setting. Sets trees deeper than they grew at the\r\nnursery, 20x30 feet. Puts a barrel half full of soil and water on a\r\nsled, and puts ten to twenty trees into it at a time; takes out a tree\r\nand sets it with as little exposure of roots to the air as possible.\r\nCultivates well, keeping the ground clean in the tree row all summer.\r\nThis winter, 1897-'98, he saw fine ten-year-old trees completely girdled\r\nby mice, in an orchard that was neglected last summer, and weeds and\r\ngrass allowed to grow next the trees; these held the snow around the\r\ntrees, and allowed the mice to burrow under to the tree. Grows corn as a\r\nprotection to the trees in summer, using a five-tooth one-horse\r\ncultivator, shallow and often, near the trees, until they begin to bear,\r\nwhen he sows to clover, and mows frequently. Thinks windbreaks are\r\nessential, and if used would make them of Osage orange or mulberry, not\r\nvery close to trees on north and west sides. Protects from rabbits by\r\nwrapping with corn-stalks and will try leaving them on this summer as a\r\nprotection from sun-scald. Prunes interlocking limbs to get into shape;\r\nbelieves it beneficial. Believes thinning would pay on choice varieties\r\nif tree was very full. Believes in using all the barn-yard litter\r\npossible, especially on poor soil. Never has pastured orchard, but might\r\nput in horses or sheep. Thinks it would hardly pay. Never has sprayed,\r\nbut believes in it. Digs out borers. Prefers to wholesale fruit in\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH C. REA, Brenner, Doniphan county: Have been in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years. Have 4000 trees six to twelve years old. I prefer\r\nfor commercial orchard Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin; add, for family\r\norchard, Minkler. Discarded Lawver because it did not bear. I prefer\r\nside-hill, clay loam, with a north slope. Prefer trees without forks,\r\nand plant a little deeper than in the nursery. I cultivate with the plow\r\nand cultivator until they begin to bear. I plant a young orchard to\r\ncorn, a bearing orchard to clover, and cease cropping when they begin to\r\nbear. Windbreaks are not essential. I wrap my trees with corn-stalks to\r\nprotect from rabbits. I prune to improve the fruit, and think it\r\nbeneficial. Never dry apples. Think that if Jonathans are planted near\r\nother trees they are better, bigger, and fuller. Winesap and Chenango\r\nStrawberry are varieties adjoining mine. Do not fertilize; would not\r\nadvise its use. Do not pasture orchard; not advisable. My trees are\r\ntroubled with buffalo tree-hopper. I dig borers out. I pick by hand and\r\nsort from a table. I sort into three classes--first, the fairest and\r\nreddest; second, smaller and paler; third, rough and poor. I prefer\r\nthree-bushel barrels to pack in; fill as full as possible, and mark with\r\nmy name. I sell in orchard, also wholesale. Leave culls on ground. My\r\nbest market is home; the buyers come and get them. I store in barrels,\r\nand find that Minkler and Mammoth Black Twig keep best. I got $1000 for\r\n805 barrels last year. I employ young men and boys, and pay $1.25 to\r\n$1.50 per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nELI HOFFMAN, Donegal, Dickinson county: Have been in Kansas nineteen\r\nyears. Have 500 apple trees, nine years planted, made up of 150 Ben\r\nDavis, 150 Missouri Pippin, 75 Winesap, and 125 of summer and fall\r\nvarieties. I prefer bottom land; don't want hilltop, unless level; don't\r\nwant any slope; would subsoil the year before planting, then plant\r\ntwenty-four feet apart each way the following year. Grow corn or\r\npotatoes the first four years, and after that, nothing. Cultivate up to\r\nnine years old; the disc and corn cultivator are good the first years; I\r\nkeep it as clean as a California orange grove; cease cropping after four\r\nyears. I think windbreaks are necessary, and would make them of a double\r\nrow of mulberries eight feet apart. For rabbits I put wire screen around\r\nthe trees. I use the pruning-knife and saw to give air. I would not\r\npasture an orchard. Have not sprayed, but intend to, with London purple.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. M.

Prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin and Winesap for market; and\r\nWinesap, Golden Sweet and Early Harvest for family use. I prefer bottom\r\nland with a north aspect, soil suitable for wheat is good for apples;\r\nwould turn in cattle after the crop is gathered, and think it pays. When\r\nthe bloom falls I spray with London purple. I pick in half-bushel\r\nbaskets and place in large piles in the orchard. I sort into three\r\ngrades; No. 1 is best, which I generally sell to shippers; No. 2 next,\r\nwhich I sell in the city to families or to dealers; the culls I peddle\r\nout, and also make into cider. My best market is Atchison. I shipped\r\nonce to a commission house in Topeka, but it did not pay. I never dry\r\nany; sometimes I store for winter in bulk in the cellar, and find that\r\nMissouri Pippin and Willow Twig keep the best.

TUCKER, Effingham, Atchison county: Has lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-eight years; has an orchard of 500 trees, 200 of them planted\r\ntwenty years and 300 planted six years. Advises for commercial orchard\r\nBen Davis, Gano, and Missouri Pippin, and adds to them for family\r\norchard Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, Genneting, and Jonathan. Has\r\ndiscarded Smith's Cider. Prefers rich, sandy upland with red clay\r\nsubsoil, with a northeast slope. He planted vigorous four-year-old\r\ntrees, first plowing, then twice harrowing; then furrow out deeply each\r\nway thirty feet apart, and set a tree at each crossing. He cultivates\r\nwith ordinary tools from six to eight years, until trees begin to bear,\r\ngrowing corn, potatoes or beans in the orchard; then seeds to clover.\r\nBelieves windbreaks essential and makes his of soft maple, ash, and\r\nwalnut. For rabbits he uses Frazer's axle grease, and kills borers with\r\nknife. Prunes little until after the trees are fifteen years old; prunes\r\nonly to give shape and keep from being too brushy. Uses stable manure\r\nand lime as fertilizers and believes it would pay on all soils he ever\r\nsaw. Pastures his old orchard with hogs at certain times of the year,\r\nand says it pays. Is troubled some with insects, and sprays twice each\r\nyear with London purple. Has not been fully successful. Picks in baskets\r\nand sacks. Makes two grades--selects and sound fair size. Packs only in\r\nbarrels; often sells in orchard. For last few years has used a few culls\r\nfor vinegar, and let the rest rot on the ground. Best market is at home.\r\nHas tried distant markets and made it pay. Never dries any, and for the\r\nlast six years has stored none for winter. Prices have ranged from\r\ntwenty to forty cents per bushel. Uses farm help at seventy-five cents\r\nto one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. F.

Use for\r\ncommercial purposes Winesap, Jonathan, and Missouri Pippin. For family\r\nuse I add Maiden's Blush and Early Harvest. My land is a black loam, in\r\nthe bottom, with an east slope. I plow deep, then list a furrow each\r\nway, and plant at the crossing. I usually grow millet in the orchard for\r\nseven or eight years, and then--if anything--clover or orchard-grass. I\r\nbelieve windbreaks are essential, and would place on the north and west\r\nsides Osage orange or mulberry trees. For rabbits, I wrap my trees. For\r\nthe borers, I use whitewash. I do not pasture. I have some insects, but\r\nhave not sprayed. I pick by hand, and sort into two classes, according\r\nto size and quality. I retail my best in the orchard and elsewhere; of\r\nthe culls I make cider. I store for winter in barrels in the cellar; am\r\nsuccessful in keeping Winesap, Jonathan, and Missouri Pippin, losing\r\nonly about one-tenth. Prices have run from twenty cents to one dollar\r\nper bushel. For picking, I use boys from town.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. HENRY, Lowemont, Leavenworth county: Been in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years; have 2500 apple trees; 1600 bearing and 900 younger.\r\nFor market varieties I use Ben Davis and Jonathan; for family orchard,\r\nWinesap, Rawle's Janet, Maiden's Blush, and Early Harvest. I prefer\r\nbottom land for Ben Davis and hilltop for Jonathan; northeast slope is\r\nbest. The soil preferred for most apples should be clay, while for Ben\r\nDavis I prefer black loam. I plant good healthy two-year-olds,\r\ntwenty-four by twenty-four feet on the hill, and thirty by thirty feet\r\nin the bottom. I have grown root grafts with great success. I cultivate\r\nin corn for six years, with a diamond and shovel plow, with a single\r\nhorse, and by all means avoid a turning plow. After this I grow weeds or\r\nclover, but use a mowing-machine. Windbreaks are essential here, and\r\nshould be made of a heavy hedge or forest on the northwest. I wrap with\r\nbrown paper for mice and rabbits. Use a knife on borers, which are the\r\nonly insects that bother me. I prune to shape the tree when young, and\r\nto increase the quality of the fruit when older; it is beneficial, and\r\npays. Winds in Kansas are more than sufficient for thinning purposes,\r\nand often thin to excess. I have tried apple trees in blocks of a kind,\r\nand also mixed, and can see no difference in fertility. I use stable\r\nlitter, rotten straw, etc.; it is next to cultivation. I would always\r\nuse such on thin soil, and on rich soil if it is not cultivated. I turn\r\nany and all kinds of stock in after gathering the fruit, and think it\r\npays, but I would not allow any live stock in a young orchard. I am\r\ntroubled some with canker-worm, flathead borer, and codling-moth. I\r\nspray from the shedding of the bloom until of the size of peas, using\r\nLondon purple, to perfect the fruit. I believe I have reduced the\r\ncodling-moth some. For picking I use good careful hands, with baskets\r\nand ladders. We sort on a cull table in the orchard into No. 1 and No.\r\n2. I prefer eleven-peck barrels, filled full enough to head without\r\nbruising, stencil the end and haul to market in a lumber wagon. I often\r\nsell in the orchard my best apples in barrels; the second grade I often\r\nsell in the orchard, too; third grade I peddle; culls I make into cider.\r\nMy best local market is Lowemont; best distant market is Denver, Colo. I\r\nnever dry any. I store in an out cellar covered with dirt, in barrels,\r\nand find Winesap keeps the best. I lose about one-tenth. Prices for the\r\nlast four years have run from 75 cents to $1.50 per barrel. I use the\r\nmost careful men, and pay seventy-five cents and board, or $1.25 without\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAS. WARDEN, Leonardville, Riley county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years; have an apple orchard of 300 trees, from five to\r\nsixteen years planted. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, and\r\nMissouri Pippin; and for family, Maiden's Blush, and some other\r\nvarieties. I prefer hilltop with black loam and clay subsoil, with an\r\neastern slope. I plant two- and three-year-old trees in deep furrows\r\nthrown out with a plow. I plant my orchard to potatoes and beans for\r\neight years, using a cultivator, and cease cropping when the trees shade\r\nthe ground; plant nothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of soft maple, Russian mulberry, or ash, two\r\nrows around the orchard, three rods from the apple trees. To protect\r\nfrom rabbits, I wrap the trees with stalks and straw. I prune my trees\r\nwith a saw, so that I can get in to pick the fruit. I think it\r\nbeneficial. I never thin the fruit while on the trees. I fertilize my\r\norchard; think it has been beneficial, and would advise it on all soils.\r\nDo not pasture my orchard. Trees are troubled with tent-caterpillar. I\r\nspray after the apples have formed, with London purple, to kill the\r\ninsects. After picking my apples, I leave them in piles in the orchard\r\nuntil cold weather, when I carry them in. Sort into two classes--cider,\r\nand selling; peddle my best apples, and make cider of the second and\r\nthird grades. Clay Center is my best market. Never dry any. I store some\r\nfor winter on shelves eight inches deep, and am successful. I find\r\nWinesap keeps best. We have to repack stored apples before marketing,\r\nlosing about fifteen per cent. I do not irrigate. Price has been\r\nseventy-five cents per bushel. I employ men at one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPHILLIP LUX, Topeka, Shawnee county: I have lived in Kansas thirty\r\nyears.

Have tried and discarded Willow\r\nTwig, Smith's Cider, Kansas Keeper, Wagener, Talman Sweet and White\r\nWinter Pearmain on account of blight and other good reasons. I prefer\r\nclay upland and subsoil, with northeast aspect. I use only number one\r\ntwo-year-old trees, planted in furrows opened up with a plow, and deep\r\nenough to receive them without the use of a spade. I plant sixteen by\r\nthirty-two feet. I cultivate my orchard to corn for four or five years,\r\nusing a hoe, plow, and five-shovel cultivator with one horse; cease\r\ncropping after four or five years; grow clover and weeds in a bearing\r\norchard, mowing twice a year and let lay on the ground. Windbreaks are\r\nnot absolutely necessary. For rabbits I find wood veneers to be best and\r\ncheapest; they come in blocks; turn one end to the sun or fire to dry;\r\nthen put on coal-tar and stick this end in the ground. I prune a little\r\nduring the first five years after planting, keeping the heaviest part of\r\ntop to the southwest. It will always pay if judiciously done. I never\r\nthin my apples while on the trees. Do not pasture the orchard with\r\nanything but chickens; it pays in eggs. My trees are troubled with\r\nroundhead borer, fall web-worm, leaf-roller, and canker-worm, and my\r\napples with codling-moth. Have not sprayed, but soon intend to, with\r\nLondon purple. I dig borers out with a knife. I pick apples in\r\nhalf-bushel baskets; sort into two classes, putting all fine, sound and\r\ngood size in first grade. I pack in three-bushel barrels and send to\r\nmarket as soon as ready by railroad. I sometimes sell my apples in the\r\norchard. I also wholesale and retail, and sell the second and third\r\ngrades where I can get the most for them; feed the culls to stock or let\r\nrot. Have tried distant markets and found it paid.

SMITH, Belleville, Republic county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-one years; have an orchard of 200 apple trees from six to eight\r\nyears old. For commercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, and\r\nMissouri Pippin; and for family, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and Rawle's\r\nJanet. I have tried and discarded Cooper's Early White; it is too\r\ntender. I prefer two feet of good soil on a hill; don't care what is\r\nbelow if drainage is good; think a northern slope best. I prefer fresh,\r\nvigorous, two-year-old trees with well-formed top, set in land plowed\r\nfor two preceding years in deep furrows both ways; open holes with hoe,\r\nthen tramp dirt well around roots. I cultivate my orchard with corn or\r\npotatoes for ten or fifteen years, using a small one-horse stirring\r\nplow, wrapping the ends of the singletree. Cease cropping when the trees\r\nget too large. Windbreaks are not essential, but think they might be\r\nbeneficial to some kinds, on the south side, to protect from hot winds.\r\nWould make them of Russian mulberry or willows. Any smell of blood or\r\nfresh meat will keep the rabbits off; I do not like wrappers, as they\r\nharbor vermin. I prune my trees some, cutting out small limbs to let in\r\nlight; think it beneficial. I thin the fruit on my trees by knocking\r\nthem off with a pole, if I can't do better, at any time; it pays when\r\noverloaded. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; do not put it\r\nclose to trees; think it beneficial if not too coarse; would advise its\r\nuse on soils where it will not force too rank a growth. I pasture my\r\norchard with growing calves, but do not think it advisable; it does not\r\npay. My trees are troubled with tent-caterpillar, flathead borer, and\r\nleaf-roller; and my apples with codling-moth and curculio. I do not\r\nspray; but think it would be beneficial. I pick my apples from a common\r\norchard platform ladder. Do not raise any apples for market. Do not dry\r\nor store any, or irrigate. Prices have been twenty-five to sixty cents\r\nin the fall, fifty cents to one dollar in the winter. Average about\r\nsixty cents per bushel for good apples. Dried apples have been five to\r\nseven cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. F. CECIL, North Topeka, Shawnee county: I have lived in Kansas twenty\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 200 trees, six to eight years planted,\r\nthree to four inches in diameter. I prefer for market Winesap, Grimes's\r\nGolden Pippin, York Imperial, and Missouri Pippin; and for family\r\norchard Red June, Benoni, Summer Rambo, Grimes's Golden Pippin,\r\nJonathan, Winesap, and Rawle's Janet. My orchard is situated on a hill.\r\nI prefer mulatto soil, with red subsoil. I prefer young, thrifty trees,\r\nplanted in furrows made with a plow and subsoiler. I plant my orchard\r\nfour to six years with any cultivated crop; if it is corn or potatoes I\r\nuse an ordinary corn cultivator; at other times I use an Acme harrow. I\r\ncease cropping when the trees begin to bear, and then plant to clover.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; I would make them of Osage orange, evergreens,\r\nor any body of timber, placed so remote that the orchard is not deprived\r\nof its nourishment. For rabbits I wrap the trees, and use potash for\r\nborers. I trim my trees while young with a knife, to encourage low\r\nheads; it pays if done moderately. It pays to thin Winesap and Rawle's\r\nJanet while on the trees. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter;\r\nwould advise its use on all soils. Do not pasture my orchard. Trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, bagworm, flathead borer,\r\nbuffalo tree-hopper, fall web-worm, leaf-miner, and leaf-crumpler; and\r\nmy apples with codling-moth and curculio. I have spayed with Paris green\r\nfor the above-mentioned insects; am satisfied that I have checked them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES M. WILLIAMS, Home, Nemaha county: I have lived in Kansas nearly\r\neighteen years. I have 400 apple trees, fifteen years planted, and of\r\ngood size. I prefer bottom land, black soil, with clay and limestone\r\nsubsoil, sloping a little to the south. I prefer to plant good\r\nthree-year-old trees, twenty-four by thirty feet apart; I cultivate all\r\nthe time with cultivator and harrow. I grow corn in the orchard from\r\neight to ten years, and oats after that. I think windbreaks are\r\nessential, and would make them of native timber, planted south of the\r\norchard. I prune with a knife and saw, and believe it makes the fruit\r\nlarger and better; I never thin on the tree. I like to put plenty of\r\nstable litter and old straw at the roots of the tree in winter. I\r\npasture with hogs after the oats come up; they eat all the windfall\r\napples and thus destroy insects. Am troubled some with caterpillars,\r\nborers, and codling-moth. Have never sprayed any. I pick by hand in\r\nsacks, from step-ladders, and put in piles. We sort by hand into three\r\nclasses--No. 1's and No. 2's for market, and No. 3 for the hogs. I sell\r\nmy best by the wagon-load in the orchard; my seconds I sell the same\r\nway, but cheaper. I never dry any. I store in the cellar, in barrels,\r\nfor winter sales to winter dealers. I find the best keepers are Winesap\r\nand Rawle's Janet. Prices in the fall, forty cents; in the winter,\r\nseventy-five cents. I hire men for help and pay one dollar per day and\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. C. COOPER, Morganville, Clay county: I have been in Kansas\r\ntwenty-eight years; have 300 apple trees, planted fifteen and nineteen\r\nyears. The best for commercial purposes are Winesap, Missouri Pippin,\r\nBen Davis, and Rome Beauty; for family use, Red Astrachan, Early\r\nHarvest, Grimes's Golden Pippin and Winesap. I have tried and discarded\r\nWillow Twig; it rots on the tree, and, by the time it gets to bearing,\r\ndies. The Snow rots on the south side and dies. The Keswick Codlin is a\r\ngood bearer but too short-lived. I prefer side-hill, sloping to the\r\nnorth, soil a black loam, without hard-pan or joint clay. I prefer trees\r\ntwo years old, limbs two feet from the ground and not too heavy top, set\r\nthirty-five feet apart, at the junction of furrows run out both ways\r\nwith a lister. I grow nothing in an orchard. Do not cultivate. I simply\r\nkeep down the weeds, and let the tree take care of itself. I don't think\r\nthe roots should be troubled in Kansas. I believe windbreaks are\r\nessential; and would put them of box-elder on the north and west of the\r\norchard. For protection against rabbits, when you first set your tree\r\ntake a good handful of slough-grass long enough to reach to the first\r\nlimb, tie at the top, in the middle, and bottom, and leave it on till it\r\nrots off; neither rabbits, borers nor sun-scald will trouble a tree thus\r\ncovered. Cut out watersprouts; but never cut off a limb without good\r\nreason. Put stable litter around your trees in a circle for the first\r\nthree years. Never pasture the orchard. Am troubled with some insects,\r\nand have never sprayed but four trees as an experiment; the apples did\r\nnot rot or fall off. We pick by hand from a ladder, and sort and place\r\nin piles in the cellar, each kind by itself. I market my best apples at\r\nhome, selling some in the orchard; the culls I make into vinegar. I\r\nstore some for winter in bulk in a cellar cave, and find that the\r\nWinesap and Missouri Pippin keep the best. I pay fifty cents per day for\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. B.

Prefer\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis for market, and would add\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, and Jonathan for family orchard. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded many varieties. I prefer a black loam, with clay subsoil, on a\r\nnorthern slope. I cultivate for six or eight years in corn, and then\r\nseed to clover. Do not think windbreaks are a necessity. I pasture my\r\norchard with horses and cattle; don't think it advisable, and don't\r\nthink it pays. I am troubled with canker-worm and round-headed borers. I\r\nspray with Paris green for canker-worm, and dig borers out with the\r\nknife. I sell my best fruit at wholesale, often in the orchard. With the\r\npoorest culls I do nothing. I find my best market right at home. Prices\r\nhave ranged from seventy-five cents to two dollars per barrel. I pay\r\nthree cents per bushel for gathering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEO. A. WISE, Reserve, Brown county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-nine\r\nyears. Have an orchard of 22,000 apple trees; 150 are eighteen years\r\nold, the rest are twenty-four years old. I have the Ben Davis, Gano,\r\nJonathan, York Imperial, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin, and for my own\r\nuse add to the above Grimes's Golden, and some summer varieties. I have\r\ntried and discarded Willow Twig as short-lived, and Northern Spy for shy\r\nbearing. In this county I would choose upland, northern slope, with\r\nblack loam soil. Would plant two-year-old, sound trees, without fork,\r\nthirty-three feet apart each way, and three inches deeper than they grew\r\nin the nursery. I cultivate thoroughly, planting to corn from six to\r\neight years. I use a disc harrow and one-horse, five-tooth cultivator; I\r\nthen sow to red clover, and cease cropping when the limbs reach out far\r\nenough to prevent me passing through with the hay-rack. While I would\r\nnot object to a windbreak on the south side, I do not think it\r\nnecessary. I wrap my trees with grass and am not bothered with rabbits.\r\nI believe in pruning trees while young; I cut off limbs that do not\r\nstand at an angle of forty-five degrees, and thin out to prevent being\r\ntop-heavy. I have never thinned apples on the trees, but believe it\r\nwould pay. I fertilize the ground all over with stable litter. I believe\r\nit does no harm and pays to pasture the orchard with hogs. I have never\r\nsprayed any. I pick apples by hand from a step-ladder into half-bushel\r\nmeasures, and sort into three grades--first, sound, and not wormy;\r\nsecond, may be wormy, but otherwise sound; third, cider. I pack in\r\nbarrels, and sell at wholesale, usually in the orchard. I sell the\r\nsecond-grade apples in bulk; make culls into cider and feed to horses\r\nand cattle. Never have tried a distant market. Never dried any.\r\nSometimes store a few for winter in bulk in a cave; not satisfactory.\r\nFind that the Winesap and Missouri Pippin keep best. Some years apples\r\nkeep better than they do others. Have never tried irrigation. Prices\r\nhave varied from sixty cents to $1.25 per barrel. I use all kinds of\r\nhelp, paying from seventy-five cents to one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. M.

Planted for commercial purpose\r\nBen Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Grimes's Golden Pippin, and for family\r\nuse advise Winesap, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Jonathan, Red June, Rawle's\r\nJanet, and Romanite. Declare Golden Russet and Sops of Wine no good. Use\r\nupland; prefer north or northeast slope; any good corn land will do.\r\nPlant good, thrifty two-year-old trees, eighteen feet apart north and\r\nsouth, and thirty-four feet apart east and west. Am trying 5000 root\r\ngrafts. Cultivate with five-tooth cultivator with twenty-inch\r\nsingletree, and a mule; up to bearing age, with corn and potatoes as a\r\nground crop; after that seed to clover. Do not think windbreaks\r\nessential for large orchards; would advise three rows of soft maples\r\naround small orchards. Use against rabbits a wash of equal parts\r\ncarbolic acid and water. It pays to remove watersprouts. Use all the\r\nbarn-yard litter available. Pasture with horses and colts in winter\r\nonly; it pays. Spray from the time the leaves appear until the apples\r\nare as big as hickory-nuts, to kill canker-worm, codling-moth, and\r\nleaf-crumpler. For borers, wash trees about June 1 with equal parts\r\ncarbolic acid and water, and if any get in after that dig them out with\r\na knife. Sort into firsts, seconds, and culls. Use barrels well shaken\r\nand pressed, marked with variety and name of grower. Usually wholesale\r\nas soon as picked. Make culls into vinegar when I cannot sell them in\r\nbulk. Never dried any, and put none away for winter except a few in\r\nboxes for family use. Find that Missouri Pippin, Rawle's Janet and\r\nRomanite keep the best. Prices run from $1.50 to $3 per barrel. Use men,\r\nwomen, and boys, and pay 1-1/2 to 2 cents per bushel for hand picking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. C.

Has discarded\r\nWillow Twig and White Winter Pearmain, because both \"rot on the trees.\"\r\nPrefers porous clay or loam in dry bottom, with north aspect. Plants\r\ntwo-year-old, low-top, fibrous-rooted trees with a spade, after marking\r\nout both ways with a plow. Grows corn and potatoes in orchard, and\r\ncultivates up to eight or ten years with double-shovel plow. Would put\r\nwindbreaks of cottonwood or soft maple on southern exposure. Protects\r\nfrom rabbits by wrapping. Prunes with saw and chisel, and says it pays.\r\nUses well-rotted stable litter while orchard is young. Thinks cautious\r\npasturing with hogs or young calves would pay. Is troubled with some\r\ninsects, but does not spray.

Have\r\ndiscarded Rawle's Janet, Cooper's Early White, and Smith's Cider, also\r\nWinesap as a market apple. Prefer a deep, sandy loam, with clay subsoil,\r\nbottom or slope land, with northeast aspect. Plant thrifty,\r\nmedium-sized, three-year-old trees twenty feet apart north and south,\r\nand forty feet east and west. I cultivate for six years in corn and\r\npotatoes; then sow to clover, plowing this under every third or fourth\r\nyear, using the Acme harrow run shallow. I believe windbreaks are\r\nbeneficial, and would prefer two rows of white elms mismatched. I wrap\r\nthe trunks of trees, for protection against rabbits. I believe in\r\npruning out all watersprouts and crossing branches; it facilitates\r\ngathering and the fruit colors better. I have tried thinning on Missouri\r\nPippins, Winesaps, and Romanites, knocking them off with a pitchfork. I\r\nbelieve in fertilizing orchards on all prairie soils with barn-yard\r\nlitter. I pasture my orchard when the trees are vigorous and the soil\r\nnot wet, with calves and pigs; I believe it pays if done with\r\nmoderation. I spray after the petals fall, using Paris green for\r\ncodling-moth, and believe I have reduced them. For borers I use a knife\r\nand wire. I pick by hand in half-bushel baskets and sort into three\r\nclasses: perfect, medium size, and culls. We sort from bins in a light,\r\nairy shed, and pack carefully by hand into standard barrels, marked\r\nfirsts and seconds, and haul to market on springs. I sell my second\r\ngrade fruit to western wagoners; we feed culls to hogs and cows. We do\r\nbest in our home market. For winter we store in bins in the cellar, and\r\nare usually successful. Prices have ranged from fifty cents to one\r\ndollar.

I cultivate with the plow and disc, growing corn in the\r\norchard for six or seven years; after that nothing. I believe in\r\nwindbreaks. I prune a little. Never thin the fruit. Do not use any\r\nfertilizer on the ground, and never pasture the orchard. I do not spray,\r\nbut use a torch every evening to burn the insects; one torch will draw\r\nthe insects about 300 feet, and we think this better than spraying.\r\n[Such lights are liable to destroy as many beneficial as noxious\r\ninsects.] I sell to wagons, as there is sufficient demand here from the\r\nwestern counties to take in that way all that I have to spare. Have\r\nnever dried any, nor stored any for winter. I do not irrigate. Prices\r\nhave been, twenty-five cents for culls, and forty to fifty cents per\r\nbushel for everything else.

Have 2800 apple trees thirteen years old, running from five to\r\neight inches in diameter, made up of equal numbers of Ben Davis,\r\nJonathan, Winesap, and Rawle's Janet. I would discard the latter. I\r\nprefer hilltop with deep vegetable or sandy loam. My trees are doing\r\nbest on an eastern slope. I plant thrifty four-year-olds. I believe in\r\ncultivation with the plow and disc harrow until the trees shade the\r\nground so that weeds cannot grow much. I grow corn for a few years, then\r\nclover for two years, after that no crop whatever. Have no use for\r\nwindbreaks, and use lath two feet long stuck in the ground around the\r\ntrees to protect from rabbits. I prune with a saw, knife, and shears, to\r\nkeep the trees in good shape and not too brushy, and believe it pays. I\r\ndo not believe it would pay to thin apples on the tree. I would not\r\npasture my orchard. I do not spray. I gather in sacks hung over the\r\nshoulder, as for sowing grain. Sort into two classes, packed into\r\nthree-bushel barrels, pressed in and marked with the name of the\r\nvariety. I sell at wholesale, but never have sold in the orchard.\r\nMinneapolis, Minn., has been my best market. We use part of the culls\r\nfor cider. Never dried any.

BATEMAN, Holton, Jackson county: Have lived in Kansas forty years.\r\nHave 900 apple trees; 200 have been planted twenty-five years, 700 have\r\nbeen planted four years. Have made more money out of Ben Davis than any\r\nother. For family use my choice is White Winter Pearmain and Rawle's\r\nJanet. I have tried and discarded Dominie and Winesap. I prefer hilltop,\r\nwith northeast slope, and a deep, friable soil; hard clay is not good. I\r\nwould plant two- or three-year-olds, in a deep furrow, preferably\r\nsubsoiled. Would cultivate as long as it don't cut the roots, with a\r\ntwo-horse cultivator, and would grow corn four or five years, then seed\r\nto clover. I believe windbreaks are very beneficial; would make them of\r\nwalnut or maple. Osage orange is fairly good; all may be raised from\r\nyoung trees or seed. I wrap young trees in the fall with paper to\r\nprotect from rabbits. I prune with the knife to prevent friction. Never\r\ntried thinning on the trees; believe it would be beneficial. Fertilizers\r\nmake the trees thriftier, but cause the roots to run nearer the surface;\r\nconsequently the trees suffer more in drought. I have pastured to a\r\nlimited extent with calves and horses; hogs injure the trees. The worst\r\ninsects I have are the flat-headed borer, which I cut out, and the\r\ncurculio. Have never sprayed, but think I will. We pick from a ladder\r\ninto pails or baskets and sort into two classes; we pick the best from\r\nthe trees, and shake the others to the ground. I sometimes sell in the\r\norchard; I wholesale when I can, but sell more to the buyers at the\r\nrailroad station. I make some cider, and feed the balance of the culls\r\nto hogs. Our best markets are the apple buyers at Holton. Have never\r\nshipped any or dried any. I store only for home use, in boxes in my\r\ncellar, and find that Rawle's Janet and Romanite are the best keepers.

Have an orchard of 6025 trees; 25 of these have been planted\r\ntwenty years, 400 seventeen years, 1200 ten years, 400 seven years, 4000\r\ntwo years. For market I grow Winesap and Ben Davis. For family use I add\r\nMissouri Pippin, Snow, and Early Harvest. Winesap best of all. I prefer\r\nhilltop, as the gophers are bad on the bottom. I prefer a black soil\r\nwith lots of gravel and small stones in it. Believe that north and east\r\nslopes are best. I plant two-year-old trees with short bodies,\r\ntwenty-five feet apart each way. I cultivate with corn for about ten\r\nyears, using the stirring plow and cultivator. I believe windbreaks are\r\nessential, and would use four rows of cherry trees set close together,\r\nor a row of hedge or box-elder, mainly on the south; some on the north.\r\nFor protection from rabbits I tie corn-stalks around the trees, and keep\r\nthem on for three or four years, winter and summer. I prune some with\r\nthe pocket-knife and saw. I do not thin the fruit unless I think the\r\nlimbs are going to break. I would use no fertilizer unless the soil is\r\nvery poor. Never pasture the orchard. I sprayed one year with London\r\npurple, using a barrel with a pump in it. I could not see that it did\r\nany good, so I let them go. I pick in buckets from a step-ladder. People\r\ncome from the west with wagons and take the apples right out of the\r\norchard, and they don't sort much. I make some culls into cider and let\r\nthe rest lay under the trees and rot. The price last year was\r\nseventy-five cents per bushel, and the year before thirty-five cents. I\r\nstore a few for winter in thin layers, one above another, in a rack in\r\nthe cellar, and am successful. Winesaps keep the best.

For\r\nmarket I use Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis; for family use I plant Early\r\nHarvest, Maiden's Blush, Lowell and Jonathan for summer, and Missouri\r\nPippin and Winesap for winter. If I were putting out now I would only\r\nplant Missouri Pippin and Winesap. I prefer bottom, and such soil as has\r\nformerly been brush and timber land. A part of my orchard slopes a\r\nlittle to the south. I plant thrifty two-year-olds, with the top leaning\r\nto the southwest. I cultivate until they begin bearing; the plow is as\r\ngood a tool as any, but care must be taken not to injure the roots. The\r\nbest crop is buckwheat or potatoes; I have had strawberries and\r\nblackberries in the orchard, but do not consider it best; I cease\r\ncropping after they come into bearing. I believe in windbreaks; I do not\r\nknow what would be best; mine is protected by natural forest-trees and\r\nOsage-orange hedge. To protect from borers, I use a wash with lye or\r\nstrong soap-suds. I tie corn-stalks around young trees to protect from\r\nrabbits. I believe it pays to prune with the saw to improve the quality\r\nof the fruit. I think stable litter is good for old orchards, but should\r\nnot be put close up around the body of the tree. I should pasture very\r\nlittle, as stock of all kinds destroy the trees and injure the fruit. I\r\nhave sprayed little, but cannot say much about it. I pick by hand, and\r\ndo not pack at all, as those that I do not find a market for here at\r\nhome I sell to shippers. I sell many in the orchard, and when there is a\r\nfull crop I sell to shippers and they grade and mark them. I sell culls\r\nfor cider when there is a call for them. I tried drying, but did not\r\nfind it profitable. I do not store any apples for winter, as I have no\r\ngood place. Prices per bushel have ranged from twenty-five to fifty-five\r\ncents.

Have tried\r\nand discarded Willow Twig, Lawver, Talman's Sweeting, Stark, Wagener,\r\nMissouri Superior and Red Astrachan on account of blight and shy\r\nbearing. I prefer hilltop or bottom with a porous subsoil which is\r\nreasonably rich. My trees planted on hard-pan are dying. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old, straight, thrifty trees, planted in land prepared as for\r\ncorn. I cultivate my orchard to corn (once to broom-corn) as long as the\r\ncorn does well, using a double shovel and a twelve-inch plow. I sow\r\nbearing orchard to oats, one bushel to the acre, and let stand. Cease\r\ncropping after seven or eight years. To protect the trees from rabbits I\r\nwrap with long grass. I prune some to form heads two or three feet from\r\nthe ground, and cut all watersprouts with a knife; but do little of this\r\nuntil the trees are twelve years planted. Have thinned apples on trees;\r\nit does not pay. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith all the barn-yard litter I can get, and think it beneficial. A\r\nneighbor fertilizes his orchard very heavily and receives splendid\r\ncrops. I pasture six acres of my orchard with hogs; they keep it well\r\ncultivated; have not thought it an injury yet. No orchard ought to be\r\nseeded to grass in this county. My trees are troubled with canker-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, and leaf-crumpler; my apples with codling-moth and\r\ngouger. I sprayed twice last year with London purple, one or two pounds\r\n[?] to a barrel of water, before and after they blossomed; it was an\r\nutter failure. When the worms appeared I increased the amount to three\r\npounds to the barrel, without any effect. [This must have been poor\r\nLondon purple.--Sec.] I gather my apples in sacks with a hoop in the\r\nopen end; then put on the sorting table, using bushel boxes and a wagon\r\nwith a plank platform to haul them on. I sort into three classes:\r\nfirsts, seconds, and culls. Sell firsts in orchard to Ryan & Richardson;\r\nsell second and third grades to teams. Make cider of the culls and those\r\nwe cannot sell. My best markets are north and northwest. I never dry\r\nany. I store from 5 to 700 bushels in a basement under granary, and am\r\nfairly successful; find Ben Davis and Rawle's Janet keep best. Do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have been from twenty-five to seventy-five cents per\r\nbushel. I employ men, and pay from fifty cents to one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHEODORE OLSEN, Green, Clay county: I have lived in Kansas thirty years.\r\nHave an apple orchard of 200 trees, fifteen feet high, eighteen years\r\nold. I prefer for commercial purposes Ben Davis and Winesap, on second\r\nbottom, black soil, with a northeast slope. I plant three-year-old\r\ntrees, not very deep, and cultivate my orchard to corn, using a\r\ncultivator run very shallow every year, and cease cropping when they\r\nbegin to bear; then plant nothing. Windbreaks are essential here; I have\r\ntrees planted around my orchard. I protect from rabbits by wrapping the\r\ntrees with corn-stalks. I never prune, and do not thin the fruit on the\r\ntrees. I fertilize my orchard with straw, and would advise its use on\r\nall soils. I do not pasture my orchard. My trees are troubled with\r\nflathead borers and leaf-crumplers, and my apples by gouger. I spray\r\nwith Paris green in June; have not reduced the codling-moth. Pick my\r\napples; sort into two classes, pack in bushel boxes, sell in the\r\norchard, also retail; I make cider of culls. My best market is Green. I\r\nnever dry any. I store some in boxes in a cellar, and am fairly\r\nsuccessful; I find Ben Davis keeps best. We have to repack stored apples\r\nbefore marketing, losing about ten per cent. Do not irrigate.

BROWN, Muscotah, Atchison county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-two years. Have an apple orchard of 150 trees, ten to twenty-five\r\nyears old. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, Jonathan, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Grimes's Golden Pippin; and for family orchard Maiden's\r\nBlush, Early Harvest, Red June, Smith's Cider, and Rambo. I prefer\r\nhilltop, with a deep, sandy loam, and a gravel subsoil, northeast slope.\r\nI prefer two-year-old, straight, thrifty trees, carefully set, 30x35\r\nfeet. I plant my orchard to corn, potatoes, beans and garden-truck for\r\nten or twelve years, using a one-horse cultivator between the rows and\r\naround the trees, and cease cropping after twelve or fifteen years;\r\nplant strawberries or small fruits in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of two rows of evergreens planted around the\r\norchard. I trap the rabbits, and wash and cut out the borers. I prune to\r\nthin and keep the tree in shape; think it beneficial, and that it pays.\r\nI do not thin the fruit while on the trees. My trees are in mixed\r\nplantings. I fertilize my orchard with horse- and cow-stable litter;\r\nthink it beneficial, and would advise its use on all soils, unless very\r\nrich. I pasture my orchard with nothing but chickens; it is not\r\nadvisable; does not pay. My trees are troubled with flathead and\r\ntwig-borers, leaf-rollers and crumplers; and my apples with codling-moth\r\nand curculio. I do not spray. I pick my apples from ladders into baskets\r\nand sacks, and sort, as I gather them, into three classes: perfectly\r\nsound, second best, and culls. I pack in baskets and boxes. I retail and\r\npeddle my apples; feed the culls to stock. My best markets are near-by\r\ntowns; never tried distant markets. We sun-dry some, and pack in sacks\r\nand boxes; we find a ready market for them; it pays.

For market I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, and Wealthy. I\r\nprefer a dark, loose soil, on a hillside with a north and east slope. I\r\nprefer good, healthy three-year-old trees, set in holes dug two feet\r\ndeep and three feet across. I plant my orchard to sweet corn, using a\r\ncultivator, and cease cropping when I think necessary and seed down to\r\nred clover. Windbreaks are essential--would make them of Osage orange.

I fertilize my orchard with rotten stable\r\nlitter, but would not advise its use on all soils. I pasture my orchard\r\nwith horses, and think it advisable, and that it pays. My trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worms, tent-caterpillar and flathead borer. I do\r\nnot spray. I pick my apples by hand in pails. Sort into three\r\nclasses--first, second, and cast out. I do not dry any. I store a few\r\nfor winter market. I do not irrigate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES ANDERSON, Leonardville, Riley county. I have lived in Kansas\r\nseventeen years; have an apple orchard of 200 trees from one to sixteen\r\nyears old, four to sixteen feet high. For market I prefer Winesap,\r\nMissouri Pippin, Jonathan, and Ben Davis, and for a family orchard Early\r\nHarvest, Missouri Pippin, Winesap, Jonathan, and Ben Davis. I prefer\r\nbottom land with black loam and clay subsoil, with a southern slope.\r\nWhen setting trees, I dig holes four feet in diameter and three feet\r\ndeep; put black loam in the bottom for the roots. I plant my orchard to\r\npotatoes for three or four years, using a plow. I cease cropping at the\r\nend of this time, and mow, and leave everything on the ground. Sow red\r\nor white clover in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential on the\r\nnorth and south sides of the orchard; would make them of maple,\r\ncottonwood, or Osage orange. I have Osage orange on the north and a\r\ncreek with native timber on the south. For rabbits I wrap the trees.\r\nWhen I see a black spot on a tree I hunt for and dig borers out. I prune\r\noff all the interfering branches and watersprouts. I do this for fruit;\r\nit pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. I keep the\r\nvarieties together when planting. I fertilize my orchard by putting\r\nstable litter a foot thick on the north side, which is the highest, and\r\nwhen it rains the liquid from it runs all the way down and\r\nfertilizes the trees. I think it beneficial, and would advise its use on\r\nall soils. I do not pasture my orchard. It is not advisable, and does\r\nnot pay. My trees are troubled with canker-worm, and my apples with\r\ncodling-moth. I have sprayed with all the sprays recommended, and think\r\nI have reduced the codling-moth a little. I pick my apples by hand from\r\na step-ladder, and sort into two classes--sound, wormy and windfalls.\r\nPut the sound ones in the cellar; make cider of the others. I sell\r\napples in the orchard, mostly at retail. They sell the best in town in\r\nthe winter. My best market is in towns west of here. I have tried\r\ndistant markets, but it did not pay. I do not dry any. I store a few\r\napples in boxes, barrels, and bulk, in a cellar. Those that keep best\r\nare Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Jonathan. Have to repack\r\nstored apples before marketing; lose about ten per cent. The average\r\nprice has been fifty cents per bushel.

Have an apple orchard of 4000 trees from twelve to\r\nthirty-seven years old. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Jonathan; and for a family orchard Winesap, Rawle's Janet,\r\nMissouri Pippin, Maiden's Blush, and Early Harvest. I have tried and\r\ndiscarded Willow Twig and Smith's Cider on account of blight; and\r\nMcAfee, Snow and Lawver on account of shy bearing. I prefer rolling land\r\nhaving a clay loam and clay subsoil. I prefer two-year-old trees, with\r\nheads twenty inches from the ground, set in the spring, about two rods\r\napart. I cultivate all the time, even in bearing orchards, using an Acme\r\nharrow, planting corn; cease cropping after four years; put nothing in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are not essential if the orchard is large.\r\nFor rabbits I wrap the trees. I dig borers out with a knife. I prune my\r\ntrees, and think it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. My\r\ntrees are planted in blocks--800 Ben Davis in one and 700 Missouri\r\nPippins in another; all bear well. I fertilize my orchard some, but not\r\nmuch. I think it would be beneficial on poor soil, but would not advise\r\nit on all soils. I pasture my orchard with horses after the fruit is\r\ngathered; can't see any harm. My trees are troubled with canker-worm and\r\nroot aphis, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray as soon as the\r\nbloom falls, and two or three times afterward, with arsenic, for\r\ninsects. Think I have reduced the codling-moth. I wash young trees twice\r\nduring the summer season with diluted soft soap for borers. Pick my\r\napples by hand, and sort into two classes. I pack in the standard apple\r\nbarrel, fill with a head press, mark with variety and grade, and haul to\r\ndepot on wagon. I sometimes sell apples in the orchard by the\r\nwagon-load. I ship my best apples, and sell the culls for what I can\r\nget. My best market is west. Have tried distant markets and found it\r\npaid. I do not dry any. I am successful in storing apples in barrels;\r\nBen Davis and Missouri Pippin keep best. I do not irrigate. Prices last\r\nfall were two dollars per barrel or fifty cents per bushel to wagoners.\r\nI employ men at one dollar per day and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. CHANDLER, Argentine, Wyandotte county. Have lived in the state\r\ntwenty-two years; have an apple orchard of 400 trees from one to nine\r\nyears old. For market I prefer Jonathan, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Ben\r\nDavis, and York Imperial; and for family orchard Huntsman's Favorite,\r\nMaiden's Blush, and Jonathan. Have tried and discarded Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin and Smith's Cider on account of blight. I prefer hilltop, with a\r\nclay soil and a light subsoil, and an east slope, as it will get the\r\nmorning sun and no southwest winds. I prefer two-year-old trees five to\r\nsix feet high, well branched, set twenty-eight by thirty feet; I also\r\nhave some twenty by thirty feet. I plant my orchard to corn, potatoes,\r\ntomatoes and cabbage for seven years, using a cultivator and harrow (I\r\nlike the Acme and spading harrow). Cease cropping after seven years;\r\nplant bearing orchard to blackberries and raspberries, but this is not\r\nadvisable; clover or cow-peas are better. Windbreaks are essential on\r\nthe prairie; would make them of a double row of Osage orange or\r\nevergreens, on the south and west. For rabbits I wrap the trees with\r\npaper or veneering, and for borers I mound the tree up. I prune a little\r\nwith my pocket-knife to remove dead and crossed limbs; it does not pay\r\nto saw and chop. I thin my fruit by hand when the crop is heavy, not\r\nlater than July 15. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my\r\norchard with ashes and bone-meal; both are beneficial, but not necessary\r\nin good potash soils.\r\n\r\nI pasture my orchard with six-months-old pigs--think it advisable in an\r\norchard that is over four years old. My trees are troubled with\r\ncanker-worms, round- and flathead borers and tent-caterpillar, and my\r\ntrees with codling-moth, curculio, and gouger. I spray with London\r\npurple and Paris green, using a hand pump. For borers I wash the trees\r\nwith whale-oil soap, carbolic acid, and sulphur, and then mound the\r\ntrees up. I pick my apples in baskets, from a ladder wide at the bottom\r\nand narrow at the top, and leave the apples in the orchard four to six\r\nweeks, then sort into three classes, from a padded table 5x12 feet,\r\nsloping; pack into twelve-peck barrels, mark with variety, and haul to\r\nmarket on a spring wagon. Sometimes I sell apples in the orchard at\r\nretail; pack my best apples in one-peck baskets for stand trade, my\r\nsecond grade in barrels. Feed the culls to the hogs; cider does not pay.\r\nMy best market is Kansas City. Have tried distant markets, but it did\r\nnot pay--too great freight and commission charges. I am successful in\r\nstoring apples in barrels in an earth cave five feet deep, earth sides\r\nand roof; keep it open when not freezing; apples can be stored in bulk\r\nby leaving a space of six inches at the sides and bottom. Jonathan and\r\nGano keep best. I have tried artificial cold storage and lost fifteen\r\nper cent. of my apples. I found it too expensive and unreliable. I have\r\nto repack the stored apples before marketing, and lose from fifteen to\r\nforty per cent. of them. I do not irrigate. Prices have been: Jonathan,\r\n$3 to $5 per barrel; Ben Davis, $2.25 to $3 per barrel. I employ men\r\nmostly, at from $1 to $1.25 per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN STOUT, Axtell, Marshall county: I have lived in the state\r\nnineteen years; have an apple orchard of 800 trees twelve to fifteen\r\nyears old. For market I prefer Winesap, Ben Davis, Jonathan, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Cooper's Early White, Duchess of Oldenburg, and Huntsman's\r\nFavorite; and for family orchard, the first five varieties mentioned.\r\nHave tried and discarded Willow Twig and White Winter Pearmain, because\r\nthe trees are not healthy. I prefer hilltop, with a black loam, and a\r\nclay subsoil having a reddish color, and a northeast slope. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old, low-head, heavy, stocky trees, set in big holes, leaning\r\nthe tree a little to the southwest; fill the hole half full, and then\r\npour in a pail of water and fill up with earth. I have always plowed and\r\ncultivated my orchard, but I will have to quit soon, as the trees are\r\ngetting too large. I use a stirring plow, spring-tooth cultivator, and\r\na harrow. Plant corn in a young orchard, and leave the stalks standing\r\nall winter; cease cropping after ten or twelve years; grow great big\r\nweeds in a bearing orchard, and plow them under in July. Windbreaks are\r\nessential on the south and west sides of the orchard; would make by\r\nplanting Osage orange seed very thick, and tend well for three years.\r\nFor rabbits I paint the trees with a mixture of sulphur, soap and lard\r\nthe first fall after planting, then every alternate year for three or\r\nfour times; it will also keep off insects, mice, and bark-louse, and the\r\ntrees will be slick and smooth, with no place for insects to harbor. I\r\nprune very little; keep out watersprouts, and let the sun into the top.\r\nI do not thin the fruit while on the trees.\r\n\r\nMy trees are in mixed plantings, but cannot see any benefit from it. I\r\nfertilize my orchard by plowing under the green weeds. I think a\r\nvegetable mold is what the trees require; think it beneficial, and would\r\nadvise it on all soils. I pasture my orchard in the spring with sows and\r\npigs; think it advisable, and that it pays. Codling-moth troubles my\r\napples. I spray right after the blossom falls, and a few days later,\r\nwith London purple, for the codling-moth, and we are getting away with\r\nhim. For borers and other insects I allow the birds in the orchard, and\r\ndo not allow the boys to go in with guns, or disturb them at all. I pick\r\nmy apples by hand from a step-ladder, and pile them under the tree. I\r\nsort in two classes from a long, wide, sloping board with sides. I pack\r\nin barrels from the piles in the orchard. Wagons come from the west and\r\nbuy the apples from the orchard at wholesale; sell the second grade to\r\napple peddlers; make cider for vinegar of the culls. My best market is\r\nat home; never have tried distant markets. Do not dry any. I store\r\napples for our own use, and have apples the year round. The Little\r\nRomanite keeps best. I do not irrigate. Apples wholesale at twenty-five\r\ncents per bushel in the orchard. I employ men at $1.25 per day.\r\n\r\nI had twenty-four very fine Siberian crabs--Hyslop, Transparent, and\r\nWhitney. They were affected with blight. Nearly all of the Siberian\r\ntrees were dead from the effects of it, and one day, while in the\r\norchard watching the movements of the birds and boys, I saw a striped\r\nwoodpecker fly to one of the trees, and he found what he supposed to be\r\na grub, but when he got through the bark he was very much disappointed,\r\nwiped his bill, and flew to another tree, where he continued to wipe and\r\nclean his bill; so I went to the tree mentioned, and found the bark very\r\nloose and sour where he had punctured it. I compared the smell and taste\r\nwith the blighted twigs and found them the same. I cut the bark that was\r\nloose from the tree, and found the rapid growth of the bark and the flow\r\nof the sap had bursted the bark from the wood, and this sap had soured\r\nand been taken up by the other sap and poisoned the ends of the new\r\ngrowth; hence, it blighted. It was sap poison, like blood poison. I then\r\nused the knife freely, splitting the body and limbs. I saved twenty out\r\nof twenty-four of the trees. I then went over the orchard and cured\r\nall the trees in one season; never been bothered since. The woodpecker\r\ntaught me a lesson, and I relate it to show the value of birds in the\r\norchard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. C.

For market I prefer Winesap, Jonathan, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Ben Davis; and for a family orchard Red Astrachan, Early\r\nHarvest, Maiden's Blush, Smokehouse, and Winesap. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Tulpehocken; it rots on the tree and will not keep. I prefer\r\nbottom land, with sandy loam and clay subsoil, and a north slope. I\r\nprefer two-year-old trees, with full top and roots, set fifteen inches\r\ndeep, in furrows checked with the plow; plant where furrows cross. I\r\nplant my orchard to corn eight years, using a plow, harrow, and\r\ncultivator; cease cropping at the end of this time and seed to clover.\r\nWindbreaks are essential on the south; would make them of Osage orange\r\nfifteen rods distant, to protect the orchard from the hard and hot south\r\nwinds. For rabbits I wrap the young trees with paper. I prune my trees\r\nafter they are eight years old, with the saw, to give light and thin the\r\ntop. I think it beneficial. I do not thin my apples; enough fall off. I\r\nfertilize my orchard by mowing the clover, and think it beneficial to\r\nyoung trees, and would advise the use of clover fertilization on all\r\nsoils. I do not pasture my orchard; is not advisable. My trees are\r\ntroubled with borers, and my apples with some insect that stings them\r\nand causes them to fall off. I do not spray. I pick my apples by hand\r\nwith care. Sort into two classes, pack in barrels, in layers, by hand,\r\nmark with variety, and haul to shipping place or market in lumber wagon.\r\nI wholesale my best apples; make vinegar of the second and third grades\r\nand culls.

I prefer\r\nblack soil with a porous subsoil, and a northeast slope. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old, small-size trees, with good roots, set in holes dug with\r\nspade in well-cultivated ground. I cultivate my orchard six years with a\r\nfive-tooth cultivator; plant corn in a young orchard, and cease cropping\r\nwhen six years old, and sow clover in the bearing orchard. Windbreaks\r\nare essential; would make them of Osage orange, by setting the plants\r\ntwelve inches apart. For the rabbits I use traps and wrap the young\r\ntrees with corn-stalks. I dig the borers out with a knife. I prune to\r\nremove crossed limbs and to keep the tree well balanced; I think it\r\npays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. I do not fertilize my\r\norchard, but think it would be beneficial on all soils. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs, but do not think it advisable; it does not pay. My\r\ntrees are troubled with roundhead borers, and my apples with\r\ncodling-moth and tree-cricket. I spray, after the blossom falls, with\r\nLondon purple. Pick apples into a sack over the shoulder from a slide\r\nladder; sort under the tree, and put the best in crates made to hold one\r\nbushel level full; we let them remain in the shade of the tree until\r\ndanger of freezing; then sort and store in the cellar, one box on top of\r\nanother. I sell apples in the orchard, wholesale and retail to customers\r\nin Topeka; make cider of the second and third grades, and give the culls\r\nto hogs. Topeka is my best market.

I prefer bottom land having a sandy subsoil, and a\r\nsoutheast slope. I prefer two-year-old, low-headed trees. In the spring\r\nI open deep furrows both ways with a plow, and plant the trees at the\r\ncross, fill the hole with good soil. I cultivate my orchard for six or\r\neight years, using a common plow till four years old, then use a shovel\r\nplow, and plant early corn, potatoes, etc., in the young orchard; cease\r\ncropping after six or eight years; plant nothing in a bearing orchard,\r\nbut keep up shallow cultivating with a disc or plow. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; I would make them of three rows of box-elder or Osage orange.\r\nI prune with a small saw or knife, to thin the top. I fertilize my\r\norchard with yard litter and ashes, scattering it all over the ground;\r\nwould advise it on all soils. I have pastured my orchard with hogs, but\r\nhave quit it. I now pasture with cows; I tie their heads down, but do\r\nnot think it advisable; it does not pay. My trees are troubled with\r\ntent-caterpillar, bud moth, and twig-borers, and my apples with\r\ncodling-moth. I do not spray. I pick my apples by hand in a basket, and\r\nsort into two classes.

For market I\r\nprefer Ben Davis and Winesap; and for family orchard add Jonathan and a\r\nfew early varieties. I prefer low land with a porous subsoil, and a\r\nnortheast slope. I prefer two-year-old trees with branches one foot from\r\nthe ground. When setting I dig big holes and loosen up the subsoil about\r\na foot. I find this gives the best satisfaction. I have always\r\ncultivated my orchard, and intend to do so three or four years longer; I\r\nplow twice a year--in spring, and the middle of June; I keep the ground\r\nwell stirred. I planted corn the first three years, listed it in, but\r\nwould not recommend it, as the trees will do better if the land is\r\nplowed. Windbreaks are essential on the south and west sides of the\r\norchard; would make them of two rows of cottonwood trees planted zigzag\r\nwith one another. For rabbits I wrap with corn-stalks. I dig borers out\r\nand wash the trees with lye water twice a year for the first three\r\nyears; it keeps the tree nice and clean and the borers out. I prune my\r\ntrees, by cutting out the limbs that cross, and to keep the trees from\r\nleaning to the north, and it pays. I fertilize my orchard with decayed\r\ncorn-cobs. I think it beneficial, and would advise it on all soils, as I\r\nthink too much straw mulching is an injury to the trees when they get\r\nold. I do not pasture my orchard; it does not pay. My trees were\r\ntroubled with canker-worms last spring. I do not spray. My best market\r\nis in the neighborhood. Prices last fall were fifty to sixty cents per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEO. R. BARNES, Chapman, Dickinson county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years; have an apple orchard of six acres old enough to be\r\nat their best. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan,\r\nand Winesap, and for family use Early Harvest, Red June, Maiden's Blush,\r\nand Missouri Pippin. I prefer a low bottom with a black loam, and a\r\nnorth slope. I prefer two-year-old, well-balanced trees, set in holes\r\nlarge enough to receive them, twenty-four by twenty-four feet. I\r\ncultivate my young orchard to corn and potatoes, using a disc harrow,\r\nand cease cropping when they begin to bear. I plant nothing in a bearing\r\norchard. Windbreaks would be beneficial on the south to protect the\r\norchard from the hot south winds. I would make it of walnut trees,\r\nbecause they sap the ground the least. To protect them from the borers,\r\nI leave the branches low down, and when we see any sawdust I dig him out\r\nwith a knife. I prune very little with knife and saw to balance the\r\ntrees. I do not thin the fruit on the trees. Some say if you expect to\r\nget a load of apples from a tree you must give it a load of manure every\r\ntime it bears, and I think this is right, but don't put it too close to\r\nthe tree. I pasture my orchard with nothing but poultry; it is not\r\nadvisable; it makes the ground too hard. Codling-moth troubles my apples\r\nvery much. I do not spray. I sell apples in the orchard; peddle the best\r\nones; make cider and vinegar of the culls. Don't dry any for\r\nmarket--just enough for family use. Prices have been from forty to\r\nseventy-five cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. M. ENGLE, Moonlight, Dickinson county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nnineteen years. Have an orchard of 600 apple trees ten to eighteen years\r\nold. For commercial orchard I prefer Ben Davis, Rawle's Janet, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Winesap. I prefer bottom or low land with a dark loam, and a\r\nnorth or northeast aspect. I prefer stout, low-headed, two-year-old\r\ntrees, planted sixteen or eighteen feet east and west and thirty or\r\nthirty-two feet north and south. I think an orchard ought to have as\r\nmuch cultivation as a corn-field. I grow early corn in my young orchard,\r\nusing an Acme and cutaway harrow, and cultivate as for corn. I cease\r\ncropping when fairly bearing. Plant nothing in a bearing orchard unless\r\nfor fertilizing, but keep cultivating. Windbreaks are essential; would\r\nmake them of evergreen, box-elder, Osage orange, maples, cottonwood,\r\netc. For rabbits I rub the trees with axle grease, or tar and fish oil,\r\nor old lard, mixed; apply with a cloth. For borers I wash with lye or\r\nstrong soap-suds. I prune my trees severely when planting, and watch\r\nthem for several years, and cut out all branches that rub or crowd, and\r\ncut out buds so that the tree will not have too many limbs for\r\nfoundation; I think it pays. I thin the fruit while on the trees; begin\r\nearly when the trees are full, and continue all through the season,\r\nwhenever I see imperfect fruit; think it pays big. My trees are mixed\r\nplantings. I fertilize my orchard with well-rotted stable litter and\r\nwood ashes; I would especially advise the use of wood ashes. I pasture\r\nmy orchard very little; would put hogs in if the limbs were not too low\r\nand full of apples; I think it would pay. My trees are troubled with\r\nflathead borer and canker-worm, and my apples with codling-moth. I\r\nintend spraying this year with Paris green and London purple for the\r\nworms, and Bordeaux mixture for blight and fungous diseases, as soon as\r\nthe blossoms fall.\r\n\r\nIn picking I use foot ladders and one-half-bushel baskets, unless the\r\nvariety is very hard; then I use sacks. Sort into three classes. Pack in\r\nbarrels shaken and pressed down, then headed, and marked with name of\r\nvariety, and haul to shipping point on wagon. Sell some apples in the\r\norchard; let the grocer have the best to sell on commission; sell second\r\nand third grades the best way I can; make cider of culls. My best market\r\nis at Abilene; never tried distant markets. Dry only for home use. Am\r\nsuccessful in storing apples in barrels and tight boxes, in a cave; find\r\nWinesap and Rawle's Janet keep well till June. Put my apples in the cave\r\nwhen the weather is cold, and keep it open cold nights, but am careful\r\nto not let it freeze. Think it best to repack stored apples when kept\r\nlate. If they are well managed you will not lose five per cent.,\r\nprobably not two per cent. Do not irrigate, but would if I had water\r\nfacilities. Prices last fall were from forty to fifty cents per bushel\r\nin the orchard, but the apples I kept over netted me $1.25 to $1.35 per\r\nbushel. I employ men and women; think women best and cheapest for\r\nsorting. Pay fifty, sixty and seventy-five cents per day.\r\n\r\nI do not consider myself a successful horticulturist, but believe, if I\r\nhad known as much about the nature or necessity of the orchard when we\r\ncame to Kansas nineteen years ago as I do now, I could have made a\r\nsuccess of it, even here in central Kansas. I would especially say that\r\nI do not believe there can be success with an orchard exposed on upland.\r\nThere might possibly be some success as a family orchard, with a good\r\nwindbreak planted around it, especially on the south side, but I would\r\nnot take ten, twenty or thirty acres of exposed upland, with apple trees\r\nenough to plant it, as a gift, if I must plant and tend it, for the\r\nproduce of it for ten or more years. I do not know of a single such\r\norchard that is worth having. I would advise selecting low ground,\r\nsloping north and east, with an elevation or good timber protection on\r\nsouth and west; land inclining to bottom or good \"draw.\" My belief is\r\nthat, with a good selection of varieties, and the proper kind of land\r\nand location, apple-raising could be made quite profitable here. Keeping\r\nthe apples in cellars is a mistake; a good cave kept as cold as possible\r\nwithout freezing is far better. I think apples should be placed on the\r\nnorth side of some shed or building before being put in the cave, and\r\nkept cool, and put into cave before freezing. Last fall I sold my choice\r\napples at the orchard at from forty to fifty cents per bushel. I kept\r\nsome in barrels in the cave. They were in good demand later. About the\r\nholidays I got $1.25, and since then $1.35. I had a contract with a\r\ngrocer to sell them for fifteen per cent., and they netted me as above.\r\nI have some in very fine condition in my cave yet [April 27]. I still\r\nopen the cave on cold nights.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHOMAS E. TAYLOR, Pearl, Dickinson county: I have lived in the state\r\nseventeen years. Have an apple orchard of seventy trees, fifty of which\r\nare twelve years old, and the other twenty are eighteen years old. I\r\nprefer Maiden's Blush, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Lowell, Jonathan, Grimes's Golden Pippin, and Willow Twig, on\r\naccount of blight. I prefer bottom land having a sandy soil and a clay\r\nsubsoil, with a north slope. I prefer two-year-old healthy trees, set in\r\nground which has been plowed very deep. I water the tree well when I\r\nplant it. I have cultivated as long as it was possible to get between\r\nthe trees. I generally use a common plow and disc harrow during the\r\nsummer, where I have no crop in. I grow corn, Kafir-corn and potatoes in\r\na young orchard. Cease cropping my orchard when twelve years old. I mow\r\nthe weeds with a machine. I think windbreaks a benefit; would make them\r\nof box-elder, ash, or red cedar. I use a pruning-knife on my trees every\r\nyear, leaving the branches quite thick on the south side. I think it\r\npays. Never have thinned the fruit on the trees. I fertilize my orchard\r\nevery two or three years with stable litter. I think it beneficial. I do\r\nnot pasture my orchard; it is not advisable, does not pay. Do not spray.\r\nPrices at picking time are forty to fifty cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. DUBOIS, Burlingame, Osage county: I have lived in Kansas forty-one\r\nyears. Have an orchard of fifty apple trees from ten to twenty years\r\nold. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin, and\r\nwould add for family orchard Early Harvest, Duchess of Oldenburg, and\r\nMaiden's Blush. I prefer a rich bottom having a red subsoil, and a\r\nnortheast slope. I prefer thrifty, two-year-old, medium-height trees,\r\nset thirty feet each way. I cultivate my orchard as long as it lives\r\nwith a shovel plow and cultivator, and keep the ground stirred. Plant\r\npotatoes in a young orchard, and cease cropping when the trees begin to\r\nbear; then sow oats and let the pigs eat it off while it is green.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential here, but some have forest-trees planted on\r\nthe north side of their orchards. I prune my trees in the spring to give\r\nshape; cannot say whether it is beneficial or not. I fertilize my\r\norchard with barn-yard litter. I pasture my orchard with pigs until the\r\nripe fruit begins to fall; I think it advisable and that it pays, as the\r\npigs eat all the wormy and worthless fruit that falls. My trees are\r\ntroubled with tent-caterpillar, root aphis, round- and flat-headed\r\nborers, and woolly aphis, and my apples with codling-moth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. J. KLEINHANS, Grantville, Jefferson county: I have lived in the state\r\nforty-one years. Have an apple orchard of 300 trees, twenty to\r\ntwenty-five years old. For market I prefer Winesap and Ben Davis; and\r\nfor family orchard Summer Astrachan, Bellflower, and White Winter\r\nPearmain. Have tried and discarded Missouri Pippin, Russet, Baldwin, Red\r\nAstrachan, Little Romanite, and Pound Pippin. My orchard is situated in\r\nthe Kaw valley. I plant my orchard to corn, until the trees get too\r\nlarge; then cease cropping and seed to clover and timothy. I prune\r\nlightly, to keep the limbs off the ground and let in the sun and light;\r\nI think it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. I pasture\r\nmy orchard late in the fall with young dehorned cattle; I think it\r\nadvisable and that it pays. My trees are troubled with canker-worms; and\r\nmy apples with codling-moths. I do not spray. I sell apples in the\r\norchard at wholesale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. W. ATKINSON, Perry, Jefferson county: I have resided in Kansas\r\nseventeen years; have an apple orchard of 2100 trees from two to\r\neighteen years old. For market I prefer Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and\r\nJonathan. I have tried and discarded Ben Davis; the tree is not hardy. I\r\nprefer a porous, red-clay subsoil, and a northeast or east aspect. I\r\ncultivate my orchard to corn six years from setting, and cease cropping\r\nafter twelve years. I seed the bearing orchard to clover. Windbreaks are\r\nessential on the south and west sides of the orchard; when possible,\r\nnatural forest is best. I prune my trees sparingly to improve the grade\r\nof fruit; I think it pays when properly done. I do not thin the fruit on\r\nthe trees. Can see no difference whether trees are in block [of one\r\nkind] or mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard when it needs it with\r\nbarn-yard litter and wood ashes; would not advise it on all soils. I do\r\nnot pasture my orchard. My trees are troubled with root aphis, and my\r\napples with codling-moth and curculio. I spray twice after the blossom\r\nfalls, with Paris green. I can get rid of borers only by persistent\r\neffort. I sort my apples into four classes: No. 1, No. 2, drying, and\r\nstock and cider. Pack in twelve-peck barrels, and market in apple racks.\r\nI sometimes wholesale my apples in the orchard. Never tried distant\r\nmarkets. I do not dry any.\r\n\r\nAm successful in storing in barrels in a fruit house which is built near\r\nthe crest of a hill with a fall of 14 in 100 feet. Excavated\r\ntwenty-three by fifty-three feet; depth at extreme back end, fourteen\r\nfeet; at front seven feet. Tile ditch fourteen inches deeper than the\r\nexcavation next to bank, filled with broken rock. Stone wall ten feet\r\nhigh; fine broken rock between wall and bank from ditch to top of wall\r\naround the entire building. The front end of the building stands three\r\nfeet out of the ground, allowing two windows in the front with\r\nrefrigerator shutters, also a refrigerator door. Heavy timbers,\r\nsupported by posts covered with bridge lumber, constitute the framework,\r\nupon which is seven feet of earth. Through the roof are five sewer-pipe\r\nventilators covered by thimble tops. In the front end are four small\r\nventilators. In the extreme back end is placed an elevator building\r\nforming an opening six feet square; this extends eight feet above the\r\ntop of the earth covering. There are three windows and one door in the\r\nelevator building. By means of small ventilators the house can be\r\nventilated very gradually, but by the elevator opening in the back end\r\nof the building, and the windows and door in the front end, the air can\r\nall be swept out by natural draft and replaced by fresh air. Five\r\nminutes is sufficient to thoroughly ventilate. During all this extreme\r\nwet weather the floor of the building has been dust dry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. CHAS. WILLIAMSON, Washington, Washington county: I have lived in\r\nKansas forty years. My first planted orchard is thirty-eight years old\r\nand the second thirty years. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Rawle's Janet; and for family use Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap, Jonathan, Rome Beauty, Rambo, Early June, and Romanite. I have\r\ntried and discarded Cooper's Early White, because it is a short-lived\r\ntree and a shy bearer. I prefer bottom land with a black loam and a clay\r\nsubsoil, with a north and east slope. I plant trees thirty feet apart. I\r\nwould advise cultivation for three years; seed bearing orchard to white\r\nclover. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of mulberries and\r\ncedar; plant seed for mulberries and set small cedars. For rabbits I use\r\ntraps and dogs. I prune, but not very much; I cut out watersprouts and\r\ndead limbs, and thin out the top so as to let sun in. I never have\r\nthinned the fruit on the trees, but think it would pay. I keep bees to\r\nhelp pollinize the blossoms. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter;\r\ntrees and plant life, as well as stock, need food. I do not pasture my\r\norchard; it is not advisable. I have sprayed with London purple. I\r\nprotect my trees from the sun, and the bark being full of sap the borers\r\nwill not trouble them. I hand-pick my apples and pack in barrels in the\r\norchard. I sell in the orchard at retail. My best market is at home. Do\r\nnot dry any. I store some apples, and find Ben Davis, Winesap and\r\nMissouri Pippin keep best. When packing apples for storing I wrap each\r\napple in paper and put a paper between the layers in the boxes; then put\r\nthem in the cellar, and they keep well. I open the cellar door on warm\r\ndays. Prices have been from 35 cents to $1.10 per bushel.\r\n\r\nThere is not a state in the union but what is profiting by the\r\nexperiences of such men as friend Wellhouse, the \"Apple King,\" and other\r\nhorticulturists, who are leaving a legacy to future generations. My\r\nexperience in orcharding has been as an amateur ever since 1856. My\r\norchard has been for home use, but now, with my experience gained here\r\nin Kansas, I am planting in the Ozark country, near Olden, exclusively\r\nfor market purposes (the same can be done in Kansas), but takes longer\r\nto come to maturity. Taxes are low in Missouri. The orchardist should\r\nnot be assessed on his fruit-trees and pay the penalty for being\r\nenergetic and a pusher in horticulture. In Kansas, thanks to the life\r\nwork of the members of the State Horticultural Society, we have reached\r\na point where the culture of fruit is an assured success; and there is\r\nmore money in it than in hog or corn raising. The trouble has been, too\r\nmany worthless varieties have been planted, and now that they are\r\nbearing are profitless; and the worst of it is they are repeating the\r\nsame mistake each year. I have saved some valuable trees from the borers\r\nby taking a quarter-inch bit and boring a hole and putting in strychnine\r\nor sulphur, and the tree lived on while all others died; even in the\r\nblack locust it was successful. I then plug the outside portion of the\r\nhole. Let some one explain the reason who understands the circulation of\r\nthe sap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nERNST FAIRCHILD, Hiawatha, Brown county: I have lived in Kansas thirty\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of fifteen acres, twelve years old. For\r\nmarket I prefer Jonathan, Ben Davis, and Rawle's Janet; and for a\r\nfamily orchard Snow, Winesap, and some sweet varieties. I prefer an east\r\nslope. I cultivate my orchard to corn or oats for eight or nine years,\r\nusing a disc and harrow, and cease cropping at the end of this time and\r\nseed down to clover. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of\r\nforest-trees set in rows, on the north and west sides. I prune my trees\r\nto give shape. I pick my apples in square tin pails which have false\r\nbottoms; slide the fruit out at the bottom. I make vinegar of the cull\r\napples. Prices have been from sixty cents to one dollar per barrel. I\r\nemploy men and boys--men at one dollar per day and boys seventy-five\r\ncents per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNEILS HANSON, Willis, Brown county: I have resided in the state\r\nthirty-two years; have an orchard of 200 apple trees twenty years old.\r\nFor all purposes, I prefer Ben Davis, Jonathan, Willow Twig, and\r\nStrawberry. Have tried and would discard Willow Twig and Lawver. I\r\nprefer bottom land having a clay soil and a north or east slope. When\r\nplanting trees, I dig a hole two feet deep and four feet square. I\r\ncultivate my orchard eight or ten years, using a plow, and spade around\r\nthe trees. I plant corn or oats in a young orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of maples or willows and cultivate the same\r\nas a crop. I prune to thin the tops, and think it beneficial. I thin the\r\nfruit when small, if the trees are overloaded. Can see no difference\r\nwhether the trees are planted in blocks of one kind, or mixed up. I\r\nfertilize my orchard, but not close to the trees; would not advise it on\r\nbottom land. I pasture my orchard with calves and hogs, but it is not\r\nadvisable; it does not pay.\r\n\r\nI do not spray. I am experimenting with my trees; I make a hole two\r\ninches deep, one-fourth inch in diameter, put in medicine and plug up\r\ntight with grafting wax over it. It is claimed to kill all the insects\r\non the tree for four or five years to come. I can tell the results this\r\nfall. It costs $10 to try it. [Hear! hear!] My neighbors spray their\r\ntrees when in blossom, and say it pays. I pick my apples by hand, sort\r\ninto two classes, and pack in barrels, filled full, and marked with\r\nconsignee's name and hauled to shipping place on wagon. I never sell\r\napples in the orchard, because they [the pickers] ruin the trees. I\r\nwholesale my best, second and third grade apples to the one offering the\r\nmost for them. I feed the culls to hogs. Hiawatha is my best market. I\r\nnever tried distant markets; it would not pay, unless in car-load lots.\r\nI dry apples, put them in sacks and hang in a dry place, and find a\r\nready market for them; it pays.

I prefer a gentle east slope at the bottom of a hill, with a\r\ndeep sandy loam or four feet of red land on lime rock. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old trees set thirty by thirty feet apart, in holes dug\r\neighteen inches deep, and filled one-third full of surface soil. I\r\ncultivate my orchard as long as it lasts with a twelve-inch plow; throw\r\nthe dirt away first of June, and back in August; then harrow it.

Windbreaks are essential;\r\nwould make them of rows of Osage orange on the north and south sides of\r\nthe orchard. I prune as little as possible. I fertilize my orchard with\r\ncow-stable and horse-stable litter mixed; I think it beneficial, and\r\nwould advise it on all soils, unless very rich. I pasture my orchard\r\nonce in a while with hogs without rings in their noses, so they can hunt\r\nworms. My trees are troubled with borers. I do not spray. I pick my\r\napples in sack from ladders. Sort into three classes, and peddle them. I\r\nuse Topping's driers and Williams's parers; they are satisfactory. After\r\ndrying I pack in fifty-pound boxes.

I\r\nhave tried and discarded Willow Twig on account of blight, and Missouri\r\nPippin on account of blight and shy bearing. I prefer high land with a\r\nporous clay subsoil, and a north, northeast or northwest aspect. When\r\nplanting trees I dig deep, wide holes, lean the tree to the southwest,\r\napply water, then fill and tramp well. I cultivate my orchard for five\r\nyears with an orchard disc; plant corn and potatoes. Seed bearing\r\norchard to clover. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of\r\nhoney-locust, maple, ash etc., on the south and west sides of the\r\norchard. For rabbits I wrap the trees with corn-stalks.

For a\r\ncommercial orchard I prefer the list recommended by the State\r\nHorticultural Society. I prefer a rich bottom with a north aspect. I\r\nprefer two-year-old trees four or five feet tall, branched low. I\r\ncultivate my orchard as long as it lives with a disc harrow or plow. The\r\nfirst five years I plant a crop that requires cultivation, and plant\r\nnothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are very beneficial; would make\r\nthem of two rows of Russian mulberries set ten feet apart in a row. I\r\nprune very little when young to balance the tree; I think it pays. I do\r\nnot thin my fruit while on the trees, but think it would pay if I had\r\ntime. I fertilize my old orchard with stable litter, and think it\r\nadvisable on all soils. If you do not do this you must prune. I do not\r\npasture my orchards. My trees are troubled with canker worm, root aphis,\r\nflathead borer, roundhead borer, woolly aphis, and leaf-roller, and my\r\napples with codling-moth, curculio, and gouger. I spray for canker-worm\r\nand codling-moth--the oftener the better. I think I have reduced the\r\ncodling-moth. I dig the borers out, and kill the rabbits. I carefully\r\npick my apples by hand from a step-ladder, into half-bushel baskets,\r\nand sort into three classes--first, second, and culls. Pack in barrels\r\nrounded up and marked on the head; then send to market by rail. I sell\r\nsome apples in the orchard, usually at wholesale. My best markets are\r\nsouth--Texas. I do not dry any. I am successful in storing in boxes,\r\nbarrels and bulk for home market; I find Fink keeps best. Never tried\r\nartificial cold storage. I have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing, losing about one-fourth of them. I do not irrigate. Prices\r\nhave been from fifty cents to one dollar per bushel.

Have an apple orchard of 1000 trees, from six to\r\neighteen years old. For a commercial orchard I prefer Missouri Pippin,\r\nBen Davis, and Winesap; and for a family orchard Yellow Transparent,\r\nEarly Melon, Jonathan, and Gano. I have tried and discarded Gilpin,\r\nLawver, and McAfee; they were not productive or good. I prefer a sandy\r\nriver bottom. I prefer one-year-old trees, set as they grew in the\r\nnursery. I cultivate my orchard to small fruits, using a disc or\r\ncultivator; cease cropping when the trees spread too much. The more\r\ncultivation the better. Windbreaks are not essential. I trap the\r\nrabbits; and dig the borers out in May and September. I prune my trees a\r\nlittle each year, to let in sunshine; I think it pays and is beneficial.\r\nI thin the fruit while on the trees a very little; but it would pay to\r\nwhile the fruit is small. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize\r\nmy orchard with barn-yard litter and ashes; and would advise their use\r\non all soils. I do not pasture my orchard; but think it would pay, with\r\ncalves and young pigs. My trees are troubled with borers and aphis, and\r\nmy apples with codling-moth. I do not spray. I pick by hand, and sort\r\ninto three classes; pack in three-bushel barrels, facing the bottoms,\r\nand ship to market by freight or express. I sell apples in the orchard;\r\nsell the second and third grades to evaporators. I have tried distant\r\nmarkets, and found it paid. I do not dry any. I am fairly successful in\r\nstoring apples in boxes and barrels, in a barn cellar, for market and\r\nfamily use, and find the Fink and Cullins keep best. Never tried\r\nartificial cold storage. I have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing; the per cent. lost depends on the variety. I do not irrigate.\r\nPrices have been from seventy-five cents to two dollars per barrel. I\r\npay my help one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM BOND, Rossville, Shawnee county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-one years; have an apple orchard of about 300 trees, from five to\r\ntwenty-five years old. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin,\r\nand Winesap; and for a family orchard would add Chenango Strawberry and\r\nMaiden's Blush. I have tried and discarded Rawle's Janet on account of\r\nrot, worms, and shy bearing, and Smith's Cider on account of blight. I\r\nprefer bottom land having a deep, porous subsoil and an east or south\r\nslope. I prefer two-year old trees, set in rows thirty feet apart each\r\nway. I cultivate my orchard with corn or potatoes for six or eight\r\nyears, using a common cultivator, and cease cropping at the end of this\r\ntime; plant the bearing orchard to clover. Windbreaks would be\r\nbeneficial; would make them of forest-trees or Osage orange, by planting\r\nin three close rows on the south and west sides of the orchard. For\r\nrabbits I tie split corn-stalks around the trees. I prune very little;\r\njust enough to keep the head open and the watersprouts off. I do not\r\nthin the fruit while on the trees. My trees are planted with one variety\r\nin a row. I do not fertilize my orchard. I do not pasture my orchard; it\r\nis not advisable. My trees are troubled with canker-worms and flathead\r\nborers, and my apples with codling-moth. I do not spray. I pick my\r\napples by hand. I sell apples in the orchard; also wholesale, retail and\r\npeddle some. The home market is best; never tried distant markets. I do\r\nnot dry or store any. I do not irrigate. Apples were fifty cents per\r\nbushel in the fall of 1897. I paid my help one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREUBEN WALTON, Aurora, Cloud county: I have lived in Kansas twenty\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 200 trees from six to eighteen years\r\nold. For a commercial orchard I prefer Ben Davis, Late Emperor, and\r\nMaiden's Blush; and for a family orchard Winesap, Cooper's Early White,\r\nLate Emperor, Maiden's Blush, and Rhode Island Greening. I prefer a\r\nnorth slope with a rich black loam and limestone subsoil. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old, well-rooted trees, set twenty feet apart. I cultivate my\r\norchard to potatoes for ten years, using a double shovel plow, and cease\r\ncropping at the end of this time, planting the bearing orchard to grass.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of evergreens. I dig borers\r\nout. I prune to give the trees more air and better shape; I think it\r\npays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees; the hail and dry\r\nweather generally do that for me. My trees are in mixed plantings. I\r\nhave one apricot tree which never bore until a swarm of bees came and\r\nlit on it, and it has borne every year since then [??]. I do not\r\nfertilize my orchard; our soil does not need it. I pasture my orchard\r\nall the time, with hogs and pigs. It is not advisable, as they injure\r\nthe trees, but they pick up the wormy fruit. My trees are troubled with\r\ncanker-worms, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray with London\r\npurple and Paris green three times, when we have the time and water to\r\nspare. Think I have reduced the codling-moth. I pick my fruit by hand\r\nand sell some apples to the neighbors in the orchard. I feed culls to\r\npigs. I never tried distant markets. I have apples dried on shares for\r\nfamily use. It does not pay to dry for market. I am partially successful\r\nin storing apples in barrels in a cellar under the house. I find Rhode\r\nIsland Greening, Ben Davis, Duchess of Oldenburg and Emperor keep best.\r\nI have to repack stored apples before marketing, losing one-fourth of\r\nthem. I do not irrigate.

CELLAR, Edwardsville, Wyandotte county: Been in Kansas twelve\r\nyears; have 2000 apple trees from two to eight years of age, comprising\r\nBen Davis, Jonathan, Gano and Missouri Pippin for commercial purposes,\r\nand Maiden's Blush, Early Harvest, Bailey Sweet, Huntsman's Favorite,\r\nGrimes' Golden Pippin and Winesap for family orchard. I have discarded\r\nthe McAfee and Lawver as unproductive. I prefer loose soil, and hill\r\nland with an east and north slope. Plant thrifty two-year-old trees, in\r\nrows 25x30 feet. I cultivate to corn, berries, etc., until seven or\r\neight years old, with the Planet jr. horse hoe, and then sow to clover.\r\nWindbreaks are not needed in our locality. I prune conservatively,\r\ncutting out broken or interlacing branches, and suckers at the base; I\r\nbelieve it pays. Have never thinned on the tree, and fertilize with\r\nbarn-yard litter and clover. I do not pasture my apple orchard. Am\r\ntroubled some with insects, but have not sprayed. I dig out borers,\r\nwhich I think may be largely prevented by the use of wooden tree\r\nwrappers. I pick in the ordinary way and divide into two classes:\r\nselect, sound, smooth apples above two inches in diameter; number two,\r\nsound apples too small for select. I do this on a sorting table, and\r\npack in twelve-peck barrels, pressed down, and marked with a stencil. I\r\nsell at wholesale, sometimes in the orchard; culls I sell in the orchard\r\nor the Kansas City market. Our best market is Kansas City. I have\r\nshipped to distant markets and made it pay. Have never dried any. Have\r\nstored for winter in barrels in cold store; they have not kept\r\nsatisfactorily, I cannot say why; Jonathan and Missouri Pippin kept best\r\nthis past winter. I had to repack this spring and lost twenty per cent.\r\nPrices have ranged from 10 cents to $1.50 per bushel.

Have 5000 trees eight years old, of Gano, Ben Davis, Jonathan,\r\nand Huntsman's Favorite; I grow no others. My location is hilltop, with\r\ngood, rich soil, and a clay subsoil; slope makes no difference. I plant\r\ntwo- and three-year-old trees, 15x30 feet, and cultivate to corn for\r\nseven or eight years, and then sow to clover and timothy. I never prune,\r\nthin, or fertilize; and allow no stock in the orchard. I do not spray,\r\nbut dig the flat-headed borer out with a knife. I use ladders, and\r\ngather in baskets and pour into a wagon, and sort in unloading; I make\r\nonly two classes, culls and good apples. I ship my best apples to\r\ndifferent points in barrels, and it pays; my culls I make into cider.\r\nHave never tried drying apples. I store some for winter in bulk, and\r\nkeep them successfully. I use men and boys for help. I sell for $1.25 to\r\n$1.50 per barrel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW. H.

Has turned down\r\nRawle's Janet, as they rot on the trees. All on best bottom land, clay\r\nsubsoil. Plants two-year-old trees thirty-five feet apart each way, with\r\nnothing [?] between. Plants to corn, and cultivates well up to twelve\r\nyears. Is protected on the southwest by a belt of timber. Keeps rabbits\r\noff by wrapping with corn-stalks. Prunes to make the tree healthier and\r\napples finer; says it pays. Plants varieties in alternate rows, but does\r\nnot say why. Uses all the stable litter he can get. Pastures with cows\r\nafter gathering; says they eat the culls and wormy fruit, and it pays.\r\nHe advises others to try it. Sprays with London purple before blooming,\r\nafter blooming, and ten days later for tent-caterpillar and\r\ncodling-moth, and believes he has reduced both of them. Has no\r\nborers--thinks \"a stitch in time saves nine.\" Picks and sorts into two\r\nclasses, first and second. Always sells in the orchard to western apple\r\nhaulers. Lets the cows have all culls he does not use for cider. Price\r\nin orchard for picked apples, forty to fifty cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. H.

Prefer, for\r\ncommercial purposes, Ben Davis, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and Rawle's\r\nJanet; and for family orchard add Early Harvest, Red Astrachan, and\r\nRambo. Have discarded all the specially recommended eastern [?]\r\nvarieties as shy bearers, and too warm for Grimes's Golden Pippin.\r\nPrefers to plant on good black loam, in ravines facing north. Plants\r\ntwo-year-old thrifty trees, some 33x33, others 33x16-1/2 feet. Have\r\ntried to grow root grafts, with poor success. Cultivate all the time\r\nwith disc and plow; grow corn for five or six years, afterward nothing.\r\nDoes not need windbreak, but would use if required--about fifteen rows\r\nof ash and catalpa, planted four by four feet. Wraps trees from rabbits.\r\nMice ate bark off and completely girdled roots six inches in diameter\r\nunder the ground last winter (1897-'98). Prunes some to keep the top\r\nbalanced and low, to prevent sun-scald and effects of wind. Uses fresh\r\nstable litter as a mulch, and believes it pays. Does not pasture at any\r\ntime. Has few insects, and does not spray much, says rains wash it off\r\ntoo readily. Picks in baskets, and finds the family the best market;\r\nstores for winter in boxes and barrels, and is successful with Rawle's\r\nJanet, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin.

I cultivate my\r\norchard about five years with a one-horse shovel plow. I plant potatoes\r\nor sweet corn in a bearing orchard, and cease cropping when the trees\r\ncover the ground, and sow red clover in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks\r\nare essential; would make them of mulberries. I prune with a saw, to\r\nmake them more productive; I think it pays. I never thin my fruit while\r\non the trees. Can see no difference whether trees are in block of one\r\nkind or mixed plantings. I do not fertilize my orchard, or spray. I pick\r\nmy apples by hand from a ladder. I do not sell in the orchard.

For market\r\nI prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap; and for a family\r\norchard Missouri Pippin, Winesap, Limber Twig, and Maiden's Blush. I\r\nhave tried and discarded Golden Russet on account of shy bearing. I\r\nprefer a sandy loam with a clay subsoil, having a north or northwest\r\naspect. I prefer two-year-old trees for planting. I plant my orchard up\r\nto bearing with potatoes and corn; then seed down to red clover.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of several rows of Osage\r\norange on the south side of the orchard. I prune my trees; thin out the\r\ntop to let the sun in for coloring. My trees are more fruitful when\r\nplanted in blocks. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; I think it\r\nbeneficial because it mulches, enriches, and holds the moisture, and\r\nwould advise its use on all soils; no land is so good but what stable\r\nlitter will make it better. I do not pasture my orchard; I do not think\r\nit advisable; but I mow all the weeds or whatever grows in the orchard\r\nand leave it on the ground for a mulching. My trees are troubled with\r\ntwig-borers and leaf-rollers, and my apples with codling-moth. I have\r\nsprayed my trees when in blossom with Paris green; did not succeed last\r\nyear. I dig borers out and pick the bad fruit (if there is any) off. I\r\nhand-pick my apples for winter use into baskets from step-ladders. I\r\nsell apples in the orchard; would rather sell that way than to hold\r\nthem. I feed the culls to pigs. My best market is at home; I never tried\r\na distant market. I do not dry any. I am successful in storing apples\r\nfor home use in a cellar. I do not irrigate, but use stable litter for\r\nmoisture.

For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin,\r\nYork Imperial, Jonathan, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Stark, and on rich,\r\nmoist soil, Winesap; and for a family orchard Early Margaret, Early\r\nJune, Early Harvest, Cooper's Early White, Sweet Bough, Keswick Codlin,\r\nMaiden's Blush, Red Astrachan, Autumn and Summer Pearmain, Rambo,\r\nFulton, Smith's Cider, and Newtown Pippin (if given extra care). Have\r\ntried and discarded Tompkins County King--the borers kill it on all\r\nsoils--and Willow Twig on account of blight. I prefer upland with a\r\nblack sandy or gravelly loam and a good limestone soil, with a porous\r\nsubsoil as a necessity, and a northeast slope. I prefer thrifty\r\none-year-old trees, set in plowed furrows and covered with a spade;\r\n\"hill up\" rather than \"dig down.\" I cultivate my orchard to corn or any\r\ncultivated crop for eight years, using a plow and harrow, and cease\r\ncropping at the end of this time, and plant nothing in a bearing\r\norchard; it does not pay. Windbreaks are essential, especially on\r\nupland. I would make them of red cedar, soft maple, or Osage orange, by\r\nplanting in rows and cultivating four to six years. For rabbits I use\r\ntarred paper, and wood ashes for borers. I prune my trees with a saw and\r\nshears to produce fruit and shape; I think it pays, but the Ben Davis\r\nand Jonathan grow into handsomer shapes if left alone. If a tree is\r\ngrowing too rapidly to set fruit, prune in June. I thin the fruit while\r\non the trees by picking off the wormy and defective ones. I keep this up\r\nuntil nearly grown; it pays. My trees are in mixed plantings, and\r\nbelieve they are more fruitful.\r\n\r\nI fertilize my orchard with barn-yard litter, ashes, salt, and lime, and\r\nwould advise it on all excepting rich soils, where it ought not to be\r\nused until after the trees have fruited five to eight years. Probably\r\nthe cheapest and best fertilizer on upland is clover mowed and left to\r\ndecay where it fell. Weeds are also good if mowed when two feet high and\r\nleft on the ground. I pasture my orchard with pigs, calves, and horses,\r\nbut it does not pay. My trees are troubled with tent-caterpillars and\r\nround-headed borers, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray with a\r\ntwo-horse wagon sprayer, also a hand sprayer, when the blossom falls,\r\nwith Paris green, and think I have reduced the codling-moth. I burn\r\ntent-caterpillars with a coal-oil lamp or torch. I pick my apples by\r\nhand into half-bushel baskets, from ladders. I sell my apples in the\r\norchard. I sell, feed to the stock, and make cider of the culls. I do\r\nnot dry any, but think it would pay. I have stored apples in barrels,\r\nand found the Winesap, Rawle's Janet, Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Stark\r\nand Baldwin keep best. I am not always successful; will not store any\r\nmore until I build a fruit house. I do not irrigate, but intend to.\r\nPrices have been from 75 cents to $1.75 per barrel.

I\r\nplant trees in rows sixteen by twenty-one feet. I mulch my orchard with\r\nstraw, and plow every three or four years. Windbreaks are essential; I\r\nwould make them of maple or box-elders, planted around the orchard. I\r\nprune some, but it does not pay. I do not thin the fruit while on the\r\ntrees. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; I think it beneficial,\r\nand would advise its use on all soils. I pasture my orchard some with\r\nswine, but it is not advisable; it does not pay. My trees are troubled\r\nwith fall web-worms. I do not spray. I pick my apples by hand. I\r\nsometimes sell the apples in the orchard at retail. My best market is at\r\nhome; I never tried distant markets. I do not dry any. Am successful in\r\nstoring apples in boxes and barrels in a cellar. Winesap and Missouri\r\nPippin keep best.

FRASER, Peabody, Marion county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-three years; have 380 apple trees ten inches in diameter,\r\ntwenty-two years planted. I prefer for commercial purposes Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, Grimes's Golden Pippin, and Maiden's Blush; and for\r\nfamily use would add Early Harvest, Sweet June, and Winesap; have tried\r\nand discarded about thirty other varieties, because they did not yield\r\nor were subject to disease. I prefer bottom land, with north slope, made\r\nland. I plow out deep, dead furrow; set trees and plow the earth back to\r\nthe trees. I prefer two- or three-year-old strong trees. Have tried root\r\ngrafts and seedlings with good success. I cultivate the trees the first\r\nten years with the plow and harrow. I grow nothing in a young orchard,\r\nand seed the old orchard to clover. I think windbreaks are essential on\r\nthe south, and would make them of Osage orange or mulberry, planted in\r\ndouble rows, a few feet apart. Wrap trees for rabbits, and for borers\r\nkeep trees thrifty. I prune some to keep the top balanced, and think it\r\nbeneficial. I have thinned fruit some, but do not think it pays. My\r\ntrees are in mixed plantings, and I keep bees. I have used fertilizer,\r\nbut could not see much benefit; would advise it only on thin soils. I\r\nhave pastured my orchard with hogs, and think it advisable; it pays. My\r\ntrees are bothered with canker-worm, root aphis, flathead borer, and\r\ntwig-borer; the codling-moth troubles my apples. I have sprayed with\r\nBordeaux mixture, London purple, and Paris green; could not see much\r\ngood; have reduced the codling-moth some. I pick my apples the\r\nold-fashioned way--with a sack. Practically, the crop has been so light\r\nthat very few have been sold, and they were fall apples. Have never\r\ndried any; have never stored any. Do not irrigate.

Have an orchard of 150 trees, planted from one to\r\nseventeen years. For family orchard would plant Early Harvest, Cooper's\r\nEarly, Duchess of Oldenburg, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Winesap, Rawle's\r\nJanet, and Ben Davis. Medium elevation, with northern or northeastern\r\nslope, and clay-loam soil with clay subsoil, is preferable. When\r\nplanting, I dig a hole large enough to receive the roots, and plant\r\nhealthy two-year-old trees, trained to a switch, so that I can train the\r\ntop to suit. Have tried root grafts and seedlings; both have done well.\r\nI cultivate while the trees are young, and use only harrow and\r\nmowing-machine after they begin to bear. I plant any hoed crop among the\r\ntrees while young, and cease when the trees begin to bear. I think\r\nwindbreaks essential, and use maple, box-elder, and Scotch pine. For\r\nrabbits I use traps and shot-gun. I use a knife for the borers. I prune\r\nwhen the tree needs it; use the saw on large trees and the knife on\r\nsmall trees. I thin the fruit sometimes when it sets too thickly, as\r\nsoon as it shows, and it pays most emphatically. I cannot see any\r\ndifference in trees whether set in blocks or mixed up. I use some\r\nbarn-yard fertilizer, and think it beneficial; would advise its use as\r\nthe trees begin to bear. I pasture my orchard with pigs and poultry;\r\nthink it advisable, and think it pays.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with bud moth, flathead borer, and twig-borer;\r\nsome seasons I also have leaf-roller and leaf-crumpler. The codling-moth\r\ntroubles my apples. I spray some to destroy these insects, with indigo\r\nand London purple, using a pump. I do not know that I have reduced the\r\ncodling-moth any. For borer I form a basin around the tree and fill with\r\nwater, repeating several times; I sometimes pick them. I use an ordinary\r\nfruit ladder, and sack with ends tied together and swung over the\r\nshoulder. I make but one class, viz., market all the perfect apples. I\r\ncarefully put in a fruit-house and let stay a week or so, then carefully\r\nsort over by removing all unsound or faulty ones. I do not ship. I have\r\na good market at home. I never sell in the orchard; usually market in\r\nbushel boxes. I usually feed second- or third-class fruit to hogs. My\r\nbest market is Concordia. Have never tried distant markets. I have never\r\ndried any apples. I store some for winter use in an ordinary cellar; am\r\nsuccessful, and find Winesap, Rawle's Janet and Missouri Pippin keep the\r\nbest. We have to repack after storing, and lose about one-third. I do\r\nnot irrigate. Winesap, Missouri Pippin and Rawle's Janet usually sell at\r\none dollar per bushel; Ben Davis, at seventy-five cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. C. GARDINER, Bradford, Wabaunsee county: Have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-nine years, in this county fourteen years; have 750 apple trees\r\nten years planted. For commercial orchard I would plant Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap and Missouri Pippin; for family use, add Jonathan and Maiden's\r\nBlush. Have tried and discarded Keswick Codlin; tree is tender. I prefer\r\nhilltop, north and west or northeast slope, black loam with a yellowish\r\nclay subsoil. I plant thirty feet apart, using one- and two-year-old,\r\nlow-headed trees. Have tried root grafts; had good success. I cultivate\r\nuntil the trees are six or seven years old with the plow and cultivator.\r\nI grow corn in a young orchard, and clover in a bearing orchard; cease\r\ncropping when six or seven years old. Windbreaks are beneficial on the\r\nsouth and west; they should be made of quick-growing trees. I wrap the\r\ntrees with paper to protect against rabbits. I prune but little to thin\r\ntop; am doubtful if it pays. Never thin apples on trees. I fertilize the\r\nland with well-rotted manure, but not close the trees; I would advise\r\nits use on all soils; I think it beneficial; I sometimes pasture my\r\norchard with hogs; do not think it advisable; pays only in getting rid\r\nof wormy fruit. My trees are troubled with leaf-roller, and my apples\r\nwith codling-moth. Do not spray. Gather my apples by hand, and sort into\r\ntwo classes, first, second and culls.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nISAAC E. WOLF, Longford, Clay county: Have been in Kansas twenty-one\r\nyears; have 200 apple trees nineteen years old, and 100 apple trees six\r\nyears old. Prefer Ben Davis, Winesap and Missouri Pippin for market, and\r\nMaiden's Blush, Duchess of Oldenburg and Smith Cider for family orchard.\r\nThe Red Astrachan and Early Harvest are shy bearers. My orchard is on\r\nsandy soil with clay subsoil; the trees look healthy. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old trees, and lay the ground off in squares, making large\r\nholes. In young orchard I plant corn for ten years, cultivating both\r\nways; after that I grow nothing, but cultivate with the disc as long as\r\nI can get through it. Am cultivating my old orchard. I think windbreaks\r\nare a necessity on the south, west, and north, and would make them of\r\nwalnut and box-elder. For rabbits I rub on strong grease. I prune with\r\nshears such limbs as rub one another, and am sure it pays. I don't think\r\nit pays to thin fruit on the trees. I believe in fertilizing the ground,\r\nbut not too close to the trees; it won't hurt any soil. Allow no stock\r\nin the orchard. The twig-borer is the worst insect in my orchard. I\r\ntried spraying on some trees, and some I did not, and my apples were all\r\nalike. I watch for borers closely, and cut them out. I pick in a grain\r\nsack, and make three classes. The best I keep for spring, the second\r\nclass for winter, and the culls I turn into cider. I peddle my apples\r\nout at home. We dry some apples and have a good market at home. We store\r\nfor winter in the cellar in bulk, and find that Winesap, Rawle's Janet\r\nand Missouri Pippin are the best keepers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT DISTRICT No. 2.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the second fruit district, comprising twenty-three\r\ncounties, in the northwest quarter of state.

For\r\ncommercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Winesap, and\r\nHuntsman's Favorite; and for family orchard Maiden's Blush, Ben Davis,\r\nand Missouri Pippin. Think I shall discard Red Astrachan and Red\r\nBetigheimer on account of shy bearing. I prefer bottom, sandy soil, clay\r\nsubsoil, and a northwest slope. I prefer good, stocky, low-headed,\r\nyearling trees set from twenty-five to thirty feet in the row; have\r\ntried root grafts; that is the only successful way to grow trees here. I\r\ncultivate my orchard to potatoes for the first two or three years, after\r\nthat to any kind of vines. I use a stirring plow, plowing very shallow\r\nnear the trees and deeper near the center. I grow nothing in a bearing\r\norchard, and cease cropping after five years. I think windbreaks are\r\nessential, and would make them of seedling peach, Russian mulberry or\r\nany quick-growing trees, in three or four rows on the south side of the\r\norchard. I trap the rabbits, and use my knife on the borers; am not\r\ntroubled with them very much. I prune trees while young to give the\r\nproper shape to the top, and later to remove the crossed limbs and cause\r\nthem to spread out and shade the trunk and as much space as possible. I\r\nhave thinned the fruit on trees to a limited extent; it should be done\r\nwhen about the size of quail eggs. Think it makes little difference\r\nwhether trees are planted in block or mixed up.\r\n\r\nI do not fertilize my orchard; the soil is rich enough; water is what it\r\nneeds. I pasture my orchard with hogs, and think it advisable, as they\r\neat all the wormy fruit and destroy many insects by rooting; I find it\r\npays. My trees are troubled with root aphis; my apples are bothered by\r\ncodling-moth, gouger, and blue jays. I spray with London purple and\r\nlime, about 100 gallons of water to one pound of purple and six pounds\r\nof lime. I think Paris green would be better. I spray for canker-worm as\r\nsoon as I see them, and am of the opinion that one application is\r\nenough, but do not think spraying of any use for codling-moth, as the\r\nmoth itself does not eat anything but the honey from the base of the\r\nbloom, and not enough of the poison reaches them to amount to anything.\r\nMy method of fighting them is, as soon as the moth appears in the\r\nspring, to put old fruit cans in the trees filled with sweet water. This\r\nattracts the moths and they drown in it. I also burn torches in the\r\norchard at night. Another way is to hang a lantern over a tub of water\r\nthat has a little coal-oil in it; this will kill a great many insects.\r\n\r\nI hand-pick my fruit into sacks slung over the shoulder; I use a\r\nstep-ladder for those I cannot reach. I sell apples in orchard; also\r\nretail; sell best ones to best customers; I dry second and third grades;\r\nof culls I make cider and vinegar and feed to pigs. My best market is at\r\nhome. I dry some apples; use a Victor evaporator, and one that I made;\r\nafter drying we heat in an oven, and put in double paper bags, and find\r\na ready market; but it does not pay. I store apples in five-bushel\r\nboxes, in a tunnel-like cellar, dug in solid sand-rock; it is fifty feet\r\nlong, five feet wide, and six and one-half feet deep, with rooms on each\r\nside; it is perfectly dry and the temperature even, but it is too warm\r\nfor winter; I find it is excellent for summer and fall apples. Those\r\nthat keep best are Rawle's Janet and Missouri Pippin. We have to repack\r\nstored apples before marketing; I do not lose many. I use or sell as\r\nsoon as fit. I irrigate my orchard from a small creek fed by springs. I\r\nhave two large dams, with ditches running along the hillside, with gates\r\nto let the water into the ditches; from the main ditch I have laterals,\r\nalso provided with gates; the surplus and seepage goes back into the\r\ncreek below the main dam; the creek below the dam has small dams in it\r\nto hold the seepage water at the desired height--which serves for\r\nsubirrigation, the best irrigation in the world. The water should not\r\nstand nearer than five feet of the surface for apples. I run the water\r\nbetween the rows in wide, shallow ditches, any time from March to\r\nSeptember. It is not necessary to have a creek to irrigate an orchard. A\r\ngood, big ditch along the hillside above the orchard will catch enough\r\nmelted snow and rain to pay for its construction; this should run into a\r\nreservoir. Prices have been from seventy-five cents to one dollar, and\r\ndried apples from five to twelve and one-half cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPETER NOON, Vesper, Lincoln county: I have lived in Kansas thirty years.\r\nHave forty apple trees eleven years old, eight to ten inches in\r\ndiameter, twelve to fifteen feet high. I prefer for all purposes Winesap\r\nand Ben Davis. I prefer bottom land with a black soil and sandy subsoil.\r\nI plant young trees in rows twenty-five feet each way. I cultivate my\r\norchard for seven years with plow and harrow, raising no crop.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; I use cottonwood trees, planted in three rows,\r\naround my orchard. I prune with a saw to make the trees bear better and\r\nkeep them from getting top-heavy; I think it beneficial. I thin my fruit\r\non the trees by hand in July. I never pasture my orchard. My trees are\r\ntroubled with bud moth. I do not spray. I pick by hand. Never dry any.\r\nDo not store any. Do not irrigate. Prices have been from seventy-five to\r\neighty cents per bushel, and dried apples eight cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJACOB WEIDMAN, Lincoln, Lincoln county: Have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-eight years. Have an apple orchard of about 1000 trees, nineteen\r\nyears old. For commercial purposes I prefer Winesap, Ben Davis, Rawle's\r\nJanet, Huntsman's Favorite, Jonathan, Maiden's Blush, Early Harvest,\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, Duchess of Oldenburg, Autumn Strawberry, Rambo,\r\nand Gano. For family orchard would prefer Winesap, Huntsman's Favorite,\r\nGilpin, Milam, Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, Red June, and Limber Twig,\r\nthe last one being a very good keeper. Have tried and discarded Red\r\nAstrachan, Lawver, Golden Russet, Yellow Bellflower, Willow Twig and\r\nSmith's Cider on account of blight. I prefer bottom land with rich soil\r\nand loose subsoil, with a northern slope. I prefer two-year-old stocky\r\ntrees planted in a furrow. I have tried root grafts with the best\r\nsuccess; the best trees in this county were grown by me. I cultivate my\r\norchard to corn, using a stirring plow; I cease cropping after six\r\nyears, but keep cultivating until the trees smother the weeds.\r\nWindbreaks are essential. I have native timber on three sides, the\r\nsouth, west, and north; and a hill on the east. For rabbits I wrap the\r\ntrees with corn-stalks, which also protects them from sun-scald. Am\r\nnever troubled with borers. I prune moderately to give shape to young\r\ntrees, and to let the sun and air to the fruit on old trees; many trees\r\nare injured by heavy pruning. I never thin.\r\n\r\nMixed plantings of trees are best; my Jonathan do well; all do well that\r\nbloom at the same time. I do not fertilize. I never pasture my orchard;\r\nwould not advise it. My trees are troubled with woolly aphis and\r\nroot-louse. I have sprayed with London purple; last year I sprayed with\r\nParis green and my apples were free from worms; if London purple is used\r\nwithout lime it burns the leaves; Paris green does not mix well, and has\r\nto be stirred all the time. I am going to use carbonate of soda and\r\nwhite arsenic this year; four parts carbonate of soda to two parts of\r\nwhite arsenic, and one gallon of water; boil for fifteen minutes, then\r\nadd another gallon of water and use two quarts of this to fifty gallons\r\nof water. I pick my apples in a sack from a ladder. I sell apples in the\r\norchard; have regular customers for the winter apples. I supply some\r\nstores with early and fall apples; never peddle any. I put my\r\nsecond-grade apples in piles of about thirty bushels each, and cover\r\nlightly with dirt until cold weather comes. A little freezing will not\r\nhurt them. In March or April I market them, and get as much for them as\r\nI get for the first-class ones in the fall. Those that keep best are:\r\nBen Davis, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, Gilpin, and Milam. We dry some apples\r\nfor home use. We put them on frames in a spent hotbed under glass, to\r\nkeep flies off. I have a large cellar in which I store apples; have\r\nnever packed them in barrels. I do not irrigate. Prices have been from\r\n35 cents to $1.50 per bushel. Have help of my own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nL. P. ASHCROFT, Shibboleth, Decatur county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-two years. Have 100 apple trees, eight to twelve years old, four\r\nto ten inches in diameter. I prefer for commercial purposes Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap, and Willow Twig. I prefer upland with a south slope. I plant\r\ntwo-year-old, low, bushy, stout-top trees. To set, I plow deep and dig\r\ndeep holes, in the fall. I cultivate my orchard every year from May 1 to\r\nJuly 1, and late in the fall. I use the harrow in the spring, disc and\r\nharrow later on, and lister in the fall. I think windbreaks would be\r\nbeneficial on the south, and would make them of buildings and sheds of\r\nall kinds. I am troubled with small borers in the limbs. I prune out the\r\ninside of trees to let sun and air through. I think it beneficial, and\r\nthat it pays. I never thin apples; the wind does the thinning. My trees\r\nare in mixed plantings, and I believe would bear every year if they did\r\nnot freeze. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter on top of heavy\r\nsnows. I think it beneficial, if not too close to the trees. I would\r\nadvise its use on all soils if applied at the right time and in the\r\nright manner. I do not pasture my orchard; it does not pay. My trees are\r\ntroubled with small borers, and my fruit with some insects. I do not\r\nspray. I have used coal-oil for borers, but do nothing now. We pick our\r\nown fruit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW. D. STREET, Oberlin, Decatur county: I have resided in the state\r\nthirty-seven years. Have an apple orchard of fifty trees seven or eight\r\nyears old, about six inches in diameter. My orchard is situated on low,\r\nbottom land. I prefer two-year-old trees, set in plowed land and dug\r\nholes. I plant my orchard to garden crops, corn, and potatoes. I plow\r\nshallow, and use a harrow and weed-cutter. I plant the same crops in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; mine are natural timber along\r\nthe creek. I prune a little with knife and saw, to preserve shape;\r\ncannot say that it has been beneficial, or that it pays. I do not thin\r\nthe fruit while on the trees; it would probably benefit. I fertilize my\r\norchard some with stable litter. I think it beneficial, as the land is\r\nheavily cropped with truck. I would not advise it on all soils. I\r\npasture my orchard with cattle, horses, and hogs, but do not think it\r\nadvisable. I have not sprayed yet, but intend to when my orchard is\r\nolder. I pick my apples by hand. I store apples for home use. With a dam\r\nacross a creek, I raise water into a pond, and irrigate. Seepage,\r\npercolation and capillary attraction do the rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES L. WILLIAMS, McDonald, Rawlins county: I have resided in Kansas\r\nnineteen years. Have an apple orchard of sixty trees, planted eight\r\nyears; planted ten acres in 1895. I prefer for family orchard Jonathan,\r\nRambo, Senator, Rawle's Janet, and Gano. I planted my orchard on a\r\nhillside; the small orchard is in the bottom; they have a clay subsoil,\r\nand slope in every direction, but would prefer a northern slope. I\r\nprefer three-year-old trees, set in holes dug four feet deep, five feet\r\nwide, filled in the bottom with soil hauled from the creek. [?] I\r\ncultivate my trees with a cultivator and harrow; I think the life of the\r\ntree depends on the cultivation, and that we will have to keep it up as\r\nlong as the tree lives. I plant potatoes and turnips in a bearing\r\norchard. Windbreaks would be a benefit, and should be made of Russian\r\nmulberry or red cedar, set in four or five rows around the orchard. For\r\nrabbits I rub axle grease on the trees. I commence pruning when I set\r\nthe trees out, using a knife and saw, to keep the tops from getting too\r\nheavy and to give shape; I think it pays. Never have thinned the fruit\r\nwhile on the trees, but would if my trees should ever be overloaded; I\r\nthink it would pay. I fertilize my orchard from the sheep corral; it\r\nkeeps the ground moist and is food for the trees. Would not advise its\r\nuse on bottom land, as the growth would be too rapid. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs, but do not think it advisable; it does not pay. My\r\ntrees are troubled with grasshoppers and flathead borers. I dig borers\r\nout in the spring, then wash the tree with strong soap-suds, which I\r\nthink eradicates all lice and insects that may be in the bark of the\r\ntree; it gives the tree a hearty, vigorous growth. I do not irrigate,\r\nbut cultivate instead.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. R. CALDWELL, Oberlin, Decatur county: I have lived in Kansas thirteen\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 110 trees, thirteen years old, six\r\ninches in diameter. For fall or winter market I prefer Winesap, Ben\r\nDavis, and Jonathan, and for summer, Cooper's Early White, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Red June, Winesap, Ben Davis, and Jonathan. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Rawle's Janet; it is not a good bearer in this locality. I\r\nprefer upland, with a deep, rich loam, and an eastern slope. I prefer\r\nthree-year-old trees, with lengthy bodies and not much top, set in holes\r\ndug three by three, one and one-half to two feet deep; fill the bottom\r\nwith some of the same dirt. I cultivate my orchard to corn and potatoes\r\nten or twelve years, using a cultivator and stirring plow; cease\r\ncropping after ten or twelve years. Windbreaks are essential; would make\r\nthem of forest-trees, by planting or transplanting them. For rabbits I\r\nwrap the trees with corn-stalks. I prune to keep the limbs from rubbing;\r\nfor any other reason it does not pay. I do not thin the fruit while on\r\nthe trees. My trees are planted in rows. I fertilize my orchard with\r\nbarn-yard litter; think it beneficial, and that it would be good for all\r\nsoils. I do not pasture my orchard; it is not advisable, and does not\r\npay. My trees are troubled with flathead borer and tent-caterpillar, and\r\nmy apples with codling-moth. I do not spray. I hand-pick my apples and\r\nsell them in our home market. I do not dry or store any. Do not\r\nirrigate. Price has been one dollar per bushel. Dried apples have been\r\nfrom five to six cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nB. F. CAMPBELL, St. Francis, Cheyenne county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nsince 1885. Have an apple orchard of 200 trees, from two to seven years\r\nplanted. I prefer bottom land, subirrigated, that is sandy, with a\r\nnorthern aspect. I prefer one-year-old trees planted in rows twenty feet\r\napart. I cultivate my orchard to vegetables as long and as often as I\r\ncan, using a harrow; cultivate after every rain if possible, and the\r\ndrier the ground, the oftener the better. Windbreaks are essential;\r\nwould make them of cottonwood, as they make the finest growth with us.\r\nFor rabbits I wrap the trees with cloth; have not been able to catch or\r\npoison the gophers yet. I prune to maintain low heads and to make\r\nshapely trees without forks, and think it beneficial. I never thin my\r\nfruit. Do not think it makes any difference whether trees are planted in\r\nblocks of one variety, or mixed up. I mulch my orchard to retain\r\nmoisture; would not advise it on all soils, as the moles make their home\r\nin it and soon kill the trees. I do not pasture my orchard; do not think\r\nit advisable. The gophers have done more damage by cutting off the roots\r\nthan all the other pests. Am also troubled with grasshoppers. Never have\r\nsprayed, but am going to this spring; will use the same chemicals as are\r\nused at the experiment station. I irrigate [sub]; can flood the ground,\r\nbut don't need to; it is wet enough without.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. W.

Have tried and discarded\r\nArkansas Black, Lawver, Jonathan, and Rawle's Janet. I prefer limestone\r\nbottom land with southeast slope. I prefer two-year-old trees three to\r\nfive feet tall. I cultivate my orchard two or three years with a common\r\nstirring plow and cultivator, and plant nothing. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of forest-trees, walls, or Osage hedge. They\r\nought to be planted before starting the orchard. For rabbits I wrap my\r\ntrees with corn-stalks. I prune only to make trees symmetrical. Do not\r\nthin my apples.

GRIFFITHS, Kanopolis, Ellsworth county: Have lived in Kansas\r\neighteen years; have an apple orchard of thirty trees. Have some trees\r\nplanted on bottom land. I cultivate my orchard to sweet corn as long as\r\nthe trees will admit, using a plow and a one-horse, five-tooth\r\ncultivator. I prune to give trees good shape. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith well-rotted stable litter. Do not pasture my orchard. Am troubled\r\nwith no insect but borers. I spray the trees when leafing out, and once\r\na week for five or six weeks after that time, to ward off the insects. I\r\nprobe for insects not affected by spraying. I do not irrigate. Prices\r\nhave been from fifty cents to one dollar per bushel. Dried apples have\r\nbeen about eight cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. E. WELLS, Athol, Smith county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears; have an orchard of twelve acres, from five to fourteen years. For\r\ncommercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin; and for\r\nfamily orchard Early Harvest and Winesap. I prefer hilltop of thin clay,\r\nresting on yellow silt, with a northern slope. I prefer two-year-old,\r\nstocky trees planted in dead furrows. I cultivate my orchard to corn as\r\nlong as there is space enough between the rows; use two five-tooth\r\ncultivators lashed together, and cease cropping after twelve years.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential. I protect against rabbits and borers by\r\neternal vigilance in hunting them. I prune by cutting out limbs, so they\r\nwill not crowd each other; think it pays. I do not thin the fruit while\r\non the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings. I do not fertilize my\r\norchard; I think shallow cultivation is better. I do not pasture my\r\norchard with anything excepting chickens. Trees are troubled with\r\ntent-caterpillar; some worm affects my apples. I sometimes spray with\r\nlime and copperas, and have not been very successful. Insects not\r\naffected by spraying I dig out with penknife and wire. I pick my apples\r\nby hand from a common ladder; sort into three classes--first, smooth and\r\nfree from worms; second, free from worms; the balance in the third\r\ngrade. I sell apples in the orchard; also retail them. I handle the best\r\napples very carefully, one at a time, and place in crates. Keep the\r\nsecond and third-grade apples at home; feed the culls to hogs. My best\r\nmarket is in the orchard; never tried distant markets. Never dry any. I\r\nstore apples for winter in a cellar on shelves, one layer of fruit on\r\neach shelf--am successful; Ben Davis keeps best. Never tried artificial\r\ncold storage. Do not irrigate. Price has been fifty cents per bushel. I\r\nemploy women, because they handle the fruit with more care than men do;\r\nI pay one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nISAAC CLARK, Oberlin, Decatur county: I have lived in Kansas ten years.\r\nI have 1250 apple trees, eight years planted, as fine as they can be. My\r\nmarket varieties are: Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Rawle's Janet, and Ben\r\nDavis, and for family I added Maiden's Blush, Red Astrachan, and Sweet\r\nJune. I prefer clay soil, on hilltop; any slope is good. Plant trees in\r\ngood condition and fine appearance, on ground plowed deep and disced\r\njust as deeply. I cultivate very often with five-tooth cultivator, and\r\nnever quit. Every third year I plow with a one-horse diamond plow. I\r\nraised melons for the first three years; after that nothing. I have no\r\nuse for windbreaks. I tie with corn-stalks, to protect against rabbits.\r\nI prune very little, to form the top, with knife and saw; keep\r\nstraggling branches out. I use very little fertilizer; only on thin\r\nsoil. I never pasture the orchard. Have some twig-borers and\r\nleaf-crumplers. I have never sprayed yet; it may soon be necessary. I\r\nhave kept my trees tied up with corn-stalks for six years; the bodies\r\nare healthy; no sun-scald and no borers. My best market is at home. I\r\nhave stored some for winter, in barrels in a cave, and find that the\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, and Rawle's Janet keep best, the latter\r\nkeeping until July. I have been able to sell in the spring at fifty\r\ncents per peck.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN M. C. KROENLIN, Lincoln, Lincoln county: I have resided in Kansas\r\ntwenty-one years. Have an apple orchard of 178 trees, from four to\r\nfourteen years old, three to twelve inches in diameter. For market I\r\nprefer Winesap and Missouri Pippin, and for family use Missouri Pippin,\r\nCooper's Early White, and Winesap. I prefer bottom land, with a black\r\nloam soil and sandy subsoil; I believe a level location best. For\r\nplanting I prefer two-year-old trees, set in holes dug three feet square\r\nand one and one-half feet deep; throw out all soil and use good surface\r\nsoil; never apply water to the roots. I cultivate my orchard until the\r\ntrees are seven years old, using a disc, and then a harrow to level the\r\nground, and plant no crop. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of\r\nRussian mulberries, on south and west sides. I have cottonwood\r\nwindbreaks on the east and north of my orchard; those on the east\r\nprotect the trees from the morning sun, thereby lessening the danger\r\nwhen there is frost on the buds, and those on the north I keep trimmed\r\nhigh, so as to admit of a free circulation of air, which is a protection\r\nagainst frost. For rabbits I wrap my trees with corn-stalks, which I\r\nthink the best way. I prune with an ax, knife, and saw, and think it\r\nbeneficial and that it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees.\r\nMy trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard with well-rotted\r\ncow-stable litter, which I think has been beneficial. I do not pasture\r\nmy orchard; I do not think it advisable. My trees are troubled with\r\ncanker-worm, but not bad, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray after\r\nthe blossoms fall, with London purple (which will kill every time), for\r\ncanker-worm. I stand on step-ladder and pick my apples by hand. I sell\r\nthem in the orchard, at retail, and feed the culls to the chickens.\r\nLincoln is my best market. Have never tried distant markets. Don't dry\r\nany; it does not pay. I am successful in storing apples in bulk in a\r\ncellar, and find Winesap and Missouri Pippin keep best. I do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have been from ten cents to two dollars per bushel, the\r\nsame season; dried apples four cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. H. SAYLES & SON, Norcatur, Decatur county: Have been in Kansas\r\nfifteen years; have 300 apple trees, eight years planted, six inches in\r\ndiameter. For market I planted Ben Davis, Winesap, Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinter Duchess (?), and I added for family use Jonathan, Duchess of\r\nOldenburg, and Red June. I have tried and discarded the Mann, Walbridge,\r\nBaldwin, Northern Spy, and Red Astrachan. I have black, northwest Kansas\r\nprairie soil, with northeast slope. Our well is seventeen feet deep, and\r\nfruit never fails. Plant low, healthy, two-year-old trees, in deep\r\nfurrows, plowed parallel with the slope, putting the trees twenty by\r\nthirty feet. I have raised some splendid seedlings. I draw on large\r\nquantities of stable litter. I grow nothing in the orchard; cultivate\r\nwith double shovel, drag, and hoe, keeping the ground flat. I believe\r\nwindbreaks are essential, and would make them of Russian mulberry and\r\nwhite elm, set one row of elm one year old, twelve to twenty-four\r\ninches, then two rows of Russian mulberry six feet apart, alternating.\r\nFor rabbits I fence with wire. I prune with knife and saw, thinning out\r\nthe tops, and think it pays. I believe in thinning the fruit as soon as\r\nit is large enough, and would plant mixed varieties. Our Jonathan never\r\nbore until the Ben Davis near by bloomed. I scatter stable litter as for\r\ngrain, and it is beneficial, as trees not fertilized die out here; it is\r\ngood on all kinds of soil. Never pasture the orchard. We have some\r\nleaf-roller, fall web-worm, and codling-moth, but have never sprayed\r\nany. We dig borers out with a wire. We pick by hand, and sort into three\r\ngrades: numbers 1 and 2, and cider stock. We never sell in the orchard,\r\nbut retail our best in one-bushel crates. Our culls we feed out to farm\r\nstock early. Our best market is at home and west; never tried distant\r\nmarkets. Have never tried drying or storing for winter. Do not irrigate,\r\nbut cultivate often. Prices range from 60 cents to $1.25 per bushel. We\r\nuse some farm help at fifteen to eighteen dollars per month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW. J.

I prefer hilltop, clay loam, with northeast slope.\r\nI plow a ditch and set two-year-old trees a little deeper than they were\r\nin the nursery. Have tried root-grafts and seedlings; were no good. I\r\ncultivate with garden-truck until twelve or fourteen years old, using a\r\nplow to stir the ground, and seed bearing orchard to grass. I use no\r\nwindbreaks. I prune to keep the tree from getting bushy; I think it\r\nbeneficial. I never thin my fruit. Cannot see any difference in trees\r\nwhether planted in blocks or mixed up. Use no fertilizer, and would not\r\nadvise its use. Do not pasture orchard; do not think it advisable. My\r\ntrees are troubled with canker-worm, flathead borers, twig-borer, and\r\nleaf roller. Codling-moth and curculio trouble my fruit. I spray with\r\nLondon purple, using a pump, just after the blossom falls, for the\r\ncodling-moth, and think I have reduced them. I pick my fruit by hand,\r\nand pack in barrels. I sort into two classes, good and bad. Have sold\r\nthem in the orchard; sometimes retail; my best market is home; have\r\nnever tried distant markets. I make vinegar of the culls. Never dry any.\r\nStore some for winter market in bulk in a cave; am successful; Winesap,\r\nWillow Twig and Ben Davis keep the best. Have never tried artificial\r\ncold storage.

I plant two-year-old trees, in rows north and south, as\r\nclose as the different varieties will allow. I cultivate as long as the\r\ntrees live, with plow and cultivator, allowing them to go no deeper than\r\nthree inches. I plant the young orchard to beans, pumpkins, and\r\nsquashes; the same in a bearing orchard, and never cease cropping.\r\nWindbreaks are essential.

I prefer bottom land with a clay\r\nsubsoil; southeast slope. I prefer two-year-old trees, planted\r\ntwenty-four feet apart, then thin them out when they crowd. I cultivate\r\nmy orchard to corn and potatoes, using a cultivator and drop harrow, and\r\ncease cropping when about six years old; plant nothing in a bearing\r\norchard. Windbreaks are not essential. To protect the trees from rabbits\r\nI rub with rabbits' blood, and whitewash for borers. I prune very\r\nlittle; remove dead limbs, and clip the others; think it beneficial if\r\nnot too severe. I do not thin my fruit while on the trees; it does not\r\npay. It is not necessary to set trees in mixed plantings when you keep\r\nbees. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; think corn-stalks best,\r\nit has proven beneficial; would advise its use on all soils. Do not\r\npasture my orchard; is not advisable; does not pay. My trees are\r\ntroubled with tent-caterpillar, bud moth, root aphis, bag-worm,\r\nroundhead borer, woolly aphis, twig-borer, oyster-shell bark-louse, and\r\nmy apples with curculio. I spray just before the bud swells, and after\r\nthey bloom, with white arsenic; sal soda and lime for canker-worms and\r\nmoths; think I have reduced the codling-moth. I hand-pick my apples;\r\nsort into two classes. Sell in the orchard, wholesale, retail, and\r\npeddle; keep the best apples at home; make vinegar of the second and\r\nthird grades, and culls.

I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old trees, planted in dead furrows. I cultivate my orchard to\r\ncorn for a number of years, using a lister, while the trees are young,\r\nand a disc when they get older. I cease cropping after six or eight\r\nyears, and plant nothing in a bearing orchard. When windbreaks are close\r\nenough to do good they sap the ground too much.

I have cultivated my\r\norchard, but think I did not do it right. A light culture to keep the\r\nsoil loose on top, to act as a mulch, would, I think, be beneficial.\r\nThink it best to grow no crop in the orchard. I think windbreaks would\r\nbe beneficial. For rabbits I use woven wire. I prune to lessen the tops;\r\nI think it ought to be done every year, so as never to cut any large\r\nlimbs; I think it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees, but\r\nthink it would be an advantage. I have put stable litter in my orchard\r\ntwo or three times during the last fifteen years, but do not think it\r\nnecessary; the land is rich enough without; would not advise its use on\r\nall soils.

I plant my orchard to corn,\r\nusing a stirring plow and harrow, and am still cultivating; would plant\r\ncorn or clover in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; would\r\nmake them of Russian mulberries. For rabbits I wrap with fine meshed\r\nwire. I prune my trees with a saw and knife to give sunlight, and make\r\nlarger fruit; think it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees.\r\nMy trees are in mixed plantings. I mulch my orchard late in the fall\r\nwith coarse manure; would advise it on all soils, unless very rich. Feed\r\nyour soil if you would have thrifty trees. I pasture my orchard with\r\nhogs; I think it advisable, and that it pays because they keep the soil\r\nloose. Trees are troubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, and\r\nborers; and my apples with worms. I do not spray, but ought to. I\r\nhand-pick my apples. I dry some for family use. I do not irrigate, but\r\nam confident we need more water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJESSE ROYER, Gove, Gove county: Have lived in Kansas thirteen years. I\r\nhave four apple trees seven years old. I prefer upland with an eastern\r\nor northeast slope. For planting, I prefer good two-year-old trees. I\r\ncultivate my orchard all the time; would plant corn, and cultivate with\r\nany tool that would do good work and kill the weeds; would not plant any\r\ncrop in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of\r\nany kind of forest-trees excepting walnut; plant two or three rows of\r\nthem all around the orchard. I prune some to give shape to trees and\r\ntake out all dead branches, and think it pays. I think a good rich [?]\r\nmulching would be beneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. Do\r\nnot pasture my orchard. I would spray if it was necessary; insects are\r\nnot very bad here. I do not dry any.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT DISTRICT No. 3.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the third fruit district, comprised of thirty-one counties\r\nin the southwest quarter of the state.

J. McNEAL, Scott, Scott county: I have lived in Kansas ten years;\r\nhave an apple orchard of sixty-five trees five years old, seven feet\r\nhigh. I prefer a clay soil with a north aspect. I plant two-year-old\r\ntrees in ground that has been plowed for two years before planting. I\r\ncultivate my orchard with a disc harrow and cultivator, and plant\r\nnothing. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of cottonwoods. I rub\r\nrabbits' blood on the trees to protect them from other rabbits. I prune\r\nmy trees with a knife and a fine saw; I think it beneficial. I have\r\nfertilized my orchard with stable litter, but it causes a too rapid\r\ngrowth; I would not advise its use on all soils. I do not pasture my\r\norchard; it is not advisable; it does not pay. I am not troubled with\r\ninsects, and do not spray. I do not irrigate, but think it would pay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG. O. VICK, Fowler, Meade county: Have lived in Kansas fourteen years. I\r\nplanted an apple orchard twelve years ago; have about fifty Missouri\r\nPippins, that have not failed to give us a crop for seven or eight\r\nyears; last fall we got three bushels from a single tree--the most ever\r\ntaken from one tree by us. They are fine keepers, and are said to be\r\nmuch better, both in color and flavor, than those grown farther east. We\r\nhave kept them in fine condition until July following, and then the\r\nsupply gave out. Have no trees where they can be irrigated, but hope to\r\nput out an orchard next spring that can be irrigated. I have the finest\r\nlocation [for irrigation] in the West, and will do my best. I prefer\r\nvalley land, with a southeast slope. Prices have been two dollars per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. A. BLACKMORE, Sharon, Barber county: I have lived in the state about\r\nfive years; have an orchard of 1100 apple trees, three years old, two\r\ninches in diameter, seven feet high. For market I prefer Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, Winesap, Early Harvest, Benoni, and Maiden's Blush.\r\nWhen planting a family orchard select varieties from the earliest to the\r\nlatest, that they may be well supplied. In planting a commercial orchard\r\nI would study the wants and demands of the people, also the varieties\r\nbest adapted to our soil and climate. Do not be like an experiment\r\nstation and plant all varieties catalogued. A mongrel orchard, like\r\nmongrel stock, is not good property. The man who has a hundred bushels\r\nof some one good variety of apples can always get the best price for\r\nthem; but if the hundred bushels consisted of ten or a dozen varieties\r\nthere would not be enough of any one variety to attract a buyer, and\r\nconsequently he must take what he can get for them. Select such\r\nvarieties as the market demands, and then confine your planting to as\r\nfew varieties as possible, and your commercial orchard will attract\r\nbuyers. I prefer a bottom, with a dark, sandy or red land, with a\r\nreddish clay subsoil, north or northeast slope. I plant thrifty\r\ntwo-year-old trees, in ground plowed deeply and marked off with a lister\r\nsixteen by thirty feet; then set the trees four to six inches deeper\r\nthan they stood in the nursery, in holes dug at the crossings. I haul my\r\ntrees to the field in a barrel two-thirds full of water, take them out\r\none at a time and trim all the broken and long roots, arranging them in\r\nnatural positions and turning the ends down in the hole, leaning the\r\ntree toward the two P. M. sun; then I fill the hole, using a rammer\r\nwhile a boy shovels the dirt in. If the soil is dry pour two or three\r\ngallons of water on the roots. When the water has soaked away finish\r\nfilling the hole, and tramp the soil lightly around the tree. When they\r\nare all set, cut them well back.\r\n\r\nI cultivate my orchard from early spring to the 1st of September, using\r\na plow, cultivator, and disc; I plant corn in a young orchard, and cease\r\ncropping after eight years, and plant nothing in a bearing orchard.\r\nWindbreaks are essential on the south and west, and I would make them of\r\nRussian mulberries. For rabbits I rub rabbits' blood on the trees twice\r\nduring the winter. Borers I cut out the first year; after that I drown\r\nthem out by cultivation. I prune my trees while they are small, to give\r\nshape. I think it pays, as you do not have to cut off large branches\r\nwhen grown. Do not have to thin fruit here in Kansas. I do not plant a\r\nsolid block of any one kind of trees; I intermingle the varieties in\r\nalternate rows, and insure more perfect pollination. I fertilize my\r\norchard with stable litter; it pays especially well on sandy soil, and I\r\nwould advise its use on all soils. Don't expect your trees to produce\r\nsomething for nothing; feed them. I do not pasture my orchard; it is not\r\nadvisable, and does not pay. My trees are troubled with canker-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, bud moth, root aphis, bag-worm, flathead borer,\r\nroundhead borer, woolly aphis, twig-borer, and oyster-shell bark-louse,\r\nand my apples with codling-moth. I do not spray. Hunt the insect eggs\r\nand nests in your trees, and destroy the source of much loss to your\r\nfruit this season. In picking, I use a ladder to reach the apples in the\r\ntop of the trees; put them in a grain sack over my shoulder with a stick\r\nin the mouth; have gathered sixty bushels per day for weeks at a time in\r\nthis way. Prices have been from one dollar to two dollars per bushel,\r\nand dried apples five to eight cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. D. EINSEL, Greensburg, Kiowa county: I have lived in the state twelve\r\nyears. I plant thrifty one-year-old trees, in holes large enough to\r\nreceive the roots, cover the roots with earth, and then pour in a pail\r\nof water. When this is soaked away fill the hole nearly full of earth. I\r\ncultivated my orchard to corn, using a spring-tooth harrow, to keep the\r\nsoil loose and kill the weeds. Am going to plant another apple orchard.\r\nI think western Kansas will yet grow apples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. N. PATTERSON, Ford, Ford county: I have lived in Kansas seventeen\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 100 trees five years old. I fertilize my\r\norchard with stable litter. Do not pasture my orchard; do not think it\r\nadvisable. I do not irrigate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN HINDS, Olcott, Reno county: I have resided in the state thirteen\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 500 trees; 375 of them are three years\r\nold, and the balance eight years old. For commercial orchard I prefer\r\nBen Davis, Missouri Pippin, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, and Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin; and for family orchard Early Harvest and Maiden's Blush. I have\r\ntried and discarded Greening, Baldwin, and Missouri Keeper. I prefer a\r\nsandy bottom with a clay subsoil, and eastern aspect. I prefer\r\nthree-year-old trees, set in the spring. I prune the roots and tops when\r\nsetting. I plant my orchard to corn or potatoes for six or eight years;\r\nplow shallow; cease cropping after eight years, and plant nothing but\r\nclover and orchard-grass in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential;\r\nwould make them of mulberries planted one or two feet apart all around\r\nthe orchard. For rabbits I make a varnish and apply to the trees in the\r\nfall. I prune my trees in June when they are large, so as to let in\r\nlight and sun; I use a tree pruner; think it pays. I do not thin the\r\nfruit while on the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize\r\nmy orchard with stable litter, but do not put it close to the trees; I\r\nthink it beneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs; I think it pays. My trees are troubled with fall\r\nweb-worm and leaf-roller. I do not spray. I pick my apples by hand; sort\r\ninto three classes from piles. Pack them in barrels and haul to market\r\non wagon. I sell apples in the orchard at retail. Make vinegar of the\r\nculls. I store some apples for home use. Price has been one dollar per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHENRY MILLER, Ulysses, Grant county: Have lived in Kansas fifteen years.\r\nI have 256 apple trees, nine and ten years planted, from three to five\r\ninches in diameter. I grow for market Missouri Pippin, Winesap, and Ben\r\nDavis, adding for family use Maiden's Blush and Grimes's Golden Pippin.\r\nI prefer bottom land, northeast slope, sandy soil, and gypsum subsoil. I\r\nplant in squares twenty-four by twenty-four feet. I have cultivated up\r\nto date with stirring plow and cultivator. I grow garden-truck among my\r\ntrees until seven years old; after that nothing. I believe windbreaks\r\nessential in this county, and would make them of Russian mulberry,\r\ncottonwood, and locust. I would plant on the outside a row of mulberry\r\nfour feet apart; next, a row of cottonwood or locust eight feet apart.\r\nTo prevent destruction by rabbits I rub with fresh blood. I prune with\r\na knife to prevent watersprouts from getting too thick; I am sure it\r\npays, and lets sunshine into the center of the trees. I use stable\r\nlitter, straw or rotted hay for fertilizer. I do not pasture my orchard,\r\nand have no insects but grasshoppers. Our crop has been light, owing to\r\ndry weather. I sell largely in the orchard. Our best market is at home.\r\nWe dry a few for home use. I keep some for winter use, in a cave dug out\r\nand covered with earth. I do not irrigate. The prevailing price for\r\napples is one dollar per bushel, and of dried apples, six cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. T. DANIELS, Kiowa, Barber county: I have lived in the state\r\ntwenty-five years. Have an apple orchard of 150 trees, from ten to\r\nsixteen years old, four to eight inches in diameter. For market I prefer\r\nMissouri Pippin, Winesap, Jonathan, Twenty-ounce Pippin, Maiden's Blush,\r\nand Rawle's Janet. Would plant the same varieties for a family orchard.\r\nHave tried and discarded Ben Davis, Early Harvest, Smith's Cider,\r\nLawver, Fink, Walbridge, and McAfee; they will not stand the heat and\r\ndrought. I prefer bottom land, with heavy loam and red subsoil,\r\nsoutheast slope, sheltered from north and south winds. I prefer a good\r\nyearling tree, planted in a dead furrow; after planting, plow two\r\nfurrows to the tree, and then harrow. I plant my orchard to corn for two\r\nyears only, using a twelve-inch plow, cultivator, and harrow. I\r\ncultivate my orchard as long as it lives, and plant nothing in a bearing\r\norchard. Windbreaks are essential on the south and north; would make\r\nthem of a belt of deciduous trees, six rods wide on the north, and\r\none-half as wide on the south; would make this of native trees--elm,\r\nash, or mulberry. For rabbits I wrap the trees with hay. I prune my\r\nyoung trees with the thumb and finger mostly, forming low heads; bearing\r\ntrees I prune very little, except to take out the blighted limbs. I thin\r\nmy apples when too full, when about the size of marbles; believe it\r\npays. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard with\r\nstable litter and ashes, but cannot see any benefit; think it would do\r\nno harm, unless heavy coats of coarse manure are plowed under. Never\r\nhave pastured my orchard, but am going to very soon; am fencing now, so\r\nI can turn in hogs. My trees are troubled with twig-borer, and my apples\r\nwith codling-moth. I do not spray. I sell apples in the orchard, and\r\npeddle the best second and third grades; give the culls to the hogs. My\r\nbest market is in Oklahoma; never have tried distant markets. I am\r\nsuccessful in keeping apples for family use in bulk in a cyclone cellar\r\ndug in the red rock. Missouri Pippin keep the best for me. Prices have\r\nbeen from fifty cents to one dollar per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD. D. WHITE, Enon, Harper county: Have lived in Kansas twenty years;\r\nhave 500 apple trees planted from three to eighteen years. For\r\ncommercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap.\r\nFor family orchard I would add Maiden's Blush and Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin. I prefer sandy bottom with an eastern slope. I would plant\r\nyearling trees, with every limb cut off, in rows twenty feet north and\r\nsouth, and forty feet east and west. Cultivate with double-shovel plow\r\nuntil they get too big to get among them, and grow nothing near them. I\r\nbelieve in a windbreak of mulberry, or any trees planted thickly, on the\r\nsouth. I prune only so that I can get under the trees. I use plenty of\r\nbarn-yard litter, for it pays in the orchard. I pasture my orchard with\r\nhogs, and think it advisable, as it pays. I have sprayed, but never saw\r\nany good in it. I dig the borers out with a wire, unless they are in the\r\nheart of the tree, and then there is no help for the tree. I pick from a\r\nstep-ladder, and sort into three classes: windfalls, wormy, and perfect.\r\nIn picking we drop the decayed and gnarly to the ground, carry the rest\r\nin baskets to the barrel, put the perfect ones in one barrel, and the\r\nothers in another. Do not disturb the best ones until you sell; the\r\nothers should be sorted again before you sell. I sell some in the\r\norchard, but peddle mostly; my best I sell to the stores in the spring;\r\nof the culls I make cider. My best market is the towns in the \"Strip.\" I\r\ndry some satisfactorily on a cook-stove evaporator, pack in flour sacks,\r\nand find a ready and profitable market for them in the spring. I store\r\nsuccessfully for winter in bulk and in barrels in a cave with\r\neighteen-inch wall arched over from the bottom. I find that Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin and Winesap keep the best. We lose, perhaps,\r\none-sixteenth. I do not irrigate. Prices range from 50 cents to $1.50\r\nper bushel, and dried apples from five to twelve cents per pound. I use\r\nonly farm hands at fifteen dollars per month and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAMOS JOHNSON, Ellinwood, Barton county: Have been in Kansas twenty-three\r\nyears; have an orchard of 2000 apple trees, planted from three to twelve\r\nyears. Varieties for market: Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Smith's Cider,\r\nand Northern Spy; for family use, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Smith's\r\nCider, Maiden's Blush, and Red June. Have no use whatever for Ben Davis.\r\nPrefer bottom land, with black, sandy soil and a southern aspect. Plant\r\ngood, thrifty two-year-old trees 25x25 feet. I plant corn or potatoes\r\nfor three or four years, and after that nothing; thoroughly cultivate\r\nwith the plow, disc, and harrow. I think a windbreak on the south side\r\nvery essential, and would make it of cottonwood and Russian mulberry, in\r\nfive rows, alternating, six feet apart. I use soap and turpentine for\r\nthe borers, and hounds for the rabbits. I believe pruning pays, and\r\nmakes the fruit much nicer. I use common pruning shears, and prune so\r\nthat the sun can get in. Never have thinned apples on the trees, but\r\nbelieve it would be a good thing. I believe in fertilizing with stable\r\nlitter; think it keeps the orchard thrifty and more fruitful. I have\r\nnever kept any stock in the orchard, but believe it would be advisable\r\nand no detriment to pasture with hogs in June and July. Have never\r\nsprayed any. I pick from step-ladders into baskets, and sort into three\r\nclasses: No. 1 are sold in barrels, No. 2 in bulk, and No. 3 go for\r\ncider. I have sold a few wagon-loads in the orchard, but I sell my best\r\napples by the bushel late in winter; I usually sell the second-grade\r\napples first, and make the culls into cider. My best market is in the\r\ncounties north and west of us; have never tried a distant market. Never\r\ndried any. For winter we store in barrels, and are successful. The\r\nMissouri Pippin and Willow Twig keep best. I irrigate on a small scale.\r\nPrices average about one dollar per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nS. S. DICKINSON, Larned, Pawnee county: Has lived in Kansas thirty-three\r\nyears, and has an apple orchard of 1800 trees, planted from seven to\r\nfifteen years. For commercial purposes he prefers Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinesap, Willow Twig, Ben Davis, and Rome Beauty, and for family use\r\nadds early apples. Has tried and discarded Red Winter Pearmain, because\r\nof blight. He is located in river bottom, with sandy soil, and a blue\r\nclay subsoil. Prefers a north and east slope. Plants two-year-old trees,\r\nwith heads two feet from the ground, in deep dead furrows. Cultivates\r\nuntil the middle of July with a disc harrow, plow, and weeder. Never\r\nceases cultivation. In the young orchard he plants corn, potatoes, and\r\ngarden-truck, and would plant the same in a bearing orchard, and cease\r\ncropping when the trees got too large. Windbreaks are essential; would\r\nmake them of any fast growing timber, by planting two rows, six to eight\r\nfeet apart, and three feet in the row. For borers and rabbits he uses\r\npaint, whitewash, and poison. He prunes his trees with a knife and\r\nshears, and thins out the tops to let the sun in, and thinks it pays,\r\nand is beneficial. He thins the fruit as soon as he sees that it is too\r\nthick. His trees are in mixed plantings, and fertilized with all the\r\nstable litter he can get. He finds it beneficial, and would advise its\r\nuse on all soils. Does not pasture his orchard, excepting in late fall\r\nand early winter, when he lets the calves run in to tramp the ground,\r\nand thinks it advisable. His trees are troubled with canker-worm,\r\nbark-louse, and some other insects; and his fruit with codling-moth. He\r\nsprays his trees twice before the buds open, with Bordeaux mixture and\r\narsenical solution, for blight; thinks he has reduced the codling-moth.\r\nPicks his apples from the trees into sacks, and hauls in a padded wagon\r\nbox. Sorts them from tables into three classes--extra, good, and medium.\r\nNever sells apples in the orchard; wholesales, retails and peddles them.\r\nHis best market is at home, but he has not enough to fill it. Does not\r\ndry any. Is successful in keeping a few apples for winter market in\r\nbarrels and boxes in a cellar, as near air-tight as possible. They keep\r\nwell until May 25, and he does not find it necessary to repack stored\r\napples before marketing. He does not irrigate. Prices have been:\r\nWholesale, 60 cents to $1.20 per bushel; retail, 80 cents, $1.40 to\r\n$1.60 per bushel.

Have 1400 apple trees nine years planted. For\r\nmarket, Ben Davis, Winesap, Red Edgar (?), Haas, and for family orchard\r\nBen Davis, Winesap, Maiden's Blush, and Whitney (crab) No. 20. I have\r\ndiscarded the Missouri Pippin, as the tree is too short-lived. I prefer\r\nsecond bottom, with sandy soil and clay subsoil; always choose north or\r\nnortheast aspect. I always plant good one-year-old trees, twenty by\r\nthirty feet apart, putting Missouri Pippins between the wide way, to be\r\ncut out later on. I grow and graft all my trees. Cultivate with a disc\r\ncultivator until the trees come into full bearing; after that every\r\nsecond year. I grow no crop in the orchard. I believe windbreaks are\r\nessential on south side; I think mulberry trees best, and would plant a\r\ndouble row two feet apart, in rows four feet apart, the nearest row\r\nforty feet away from apple trees. I shoot and trap the rabbits. I only\r\nprune enough to keep the tree well balanced. I often thin Winesaps on\r\nthe tree because I think they need it, and it pays. I believe in mixed\r\nplantings, and therefore plant Ben Davis among all the others. I spread\r\nstable litter among my trees after they come into bearing; sandy soil, I\r\nthink, requires the most fertilizer. I pasture in a small way, putting\r\nmy little calves in, in the spring. Am only bothered with a few\r\ncodling-moth and flat-headed borers. I do not spray, but I make way with\r\nall the fallen fruit. I hunt borers and kill with a wire. Pick by hand\r\nas soon as well colored; sort into two classes; the best is first, and\r\nall sound smaller fruit second. We pack in barrels by hand, marking with\r\nthe variety and class. We sell ours all at home; usually they are\r\nengaged before they are picked. Our second grade we keep at home; culls\r\nare made into cider. Our apples are sold in Dodge City and Larned. Have\r\nnever shipped any; have never dried any. I store some second grade in\r\nbarrels and bulk in the cellar, and find that Missouri Pippins, Ben\r\nDavis, and Winesaps keep the best, and I do not lose over three per\r\ncent. Some seasons I irrigate, with windmills. Prices vary from 75 cents\r\nto $1.25 per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nL. G. MORGAN, Richfield, Morton county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nforty-three years; have an apple orchard of 125 trees, medium size, ten\r\nyears old. For all purposes I prefer Missouri Pippin, Winesap, and\r\nMaiden's Blush. I prefer black loam bottom, with clay subsoil, northern\r\nslope. I plant two-year-old trees with small tops, well rooted, in\r\nlarge holes, and filled in with well-worked soil. I cultivate my orchard\r\nto vines, using a stirring plow and hoe, and cease cropping after six\r\nyears, but keep cultivating, and plant nothing in a bearing orchard.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of forest-trees planted in\r\nhit-and-miss rows around the orchard. Am not troubled with rabbits and\r\nborers. I prune with a saw and knife to give shape; think it beneficial.\r\nI thin apples on the trees as soon as large enough. My trees are in\r\nmixed plantings; Maiden's Blush are surrounded by Pippins and Rambos. I\r\nthink they are more fruitful. I do not fertilize. I pasture my orchard\r\nwith chickens and turkeys; I think it advisable, to keep out bugs. Trees\r\nare troubled with tent-caterpillar. I pick my apples by hand into\r\nbaskets from step-ladders, and sort into three classes, choice, common,\r\nand culls, while gathering. I pack in barrels, placing a layer in the\r\nbottom, mark with paint, and haul to market on a wagon. I sell apples in\r\nthe orchard, also retail to merchants; make cider of culls. Richfield is\r\nmy best market. Do not dry any. Am successful in storing apples for\r\nwinter in boxes and barrels in cellar; find Missouri Pippin and Winesap\r\nkeep best. Lose about two per cent. of the stored apples. I irrigate my\r\ntrees direct from a well, in ditches running close to the trees. Price\r\nhas been one dollar per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. MORGAN, Hutchinson, Reno county: I have lived in Kansas seventeen\r\nyears; have sixty acres of apples, from four to sixteen years old. For\r\ncommercial orchard I prefer Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Winesap; and\r\nfor family orchard Early Harvest, Cooper's Early White, Maiden's Blush,\r\nJonathan, and Grimes's Golden Pippin. Have tried and discarded Snow and\r\nEarly Pennock on account of blight. I prefer river bottom with a clay\r\nsubsoil. I plant two-year-old, large, thrifty trees, at the crossings of\r\nfurrows made with a lister, twenty by thirty feet. I cultivate for the\r\nfirst four years to corn and garden-truck, using a Planet jr.\r\ncultivator, then use a one-horse plow for two years, and cease cropping\r\nwhen bearing begins heavily, and plant nothing. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of one row of Osage orange, on the west side\r\nof orchard. For rabbits I use tree paint and wood veneers. I prune my\r\ntrees in the winter, to produce health and give good form; think it\r\nbeneficial, and that it pays. I do not thin my fruit while on the trees,\r\nbut think it would pay. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; think\r\nit beneficial; would advise its use on sandy land. My trees are troubled\r\nwith flathead borer, and my fruit with codling-moth and curculio. I do\r\nnot spray. I pick my apples from ladders; pile those taken from eight\r\ntrees together and cover with hay. Sort into three classes: First, sound\r\nand large; second, sound and small; third, spotted. I sell apples in the\r\norchard, also wholesale and retail; pack my best in bushel boxes and\r\nsell to grocers. Sell my second and third grades to peddlers and farmers\r\nfrom the west. My best market is at home. Have tried distant markets and\r\nfound they paid. Am successful in storing apples in bulk in a bank\r\ncellar, Winesap and Missouri Pippin keeping the best. Do not irrigate.\r\nGood apples sold here this winter for one dollar per bushel. I employ\r\nfarm hands at farm wages.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. H. LONGSTRETH, Lakin, Kearny county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-nine\r\nyears. I have 3400 apple trees--500 eleven years old, 1200 eight years\r\nold, 700 six years old, and 1000 set this spring. For market I prefer\r\nBen Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap. For family use I would advise\r\nEarly Harvest, Red June, Maiden's Blush, Chenango Strawberry, Smith's\r\nCider, Huntsman's Favorite, Rome Beauty, Jonathan, Ben Davis, Winesap,\r\nand Missouri Pippin. Have discarded the Red Astrachan, Willow Twig, and\r\nCooper's Early White, as they will not bear. I prefer second bottom,\r\nnot too high or too low; sandy loam, with loose clay subsoil; any slope\r\nis good, north preferred. I prefer small-sized, well rooted,\r\ntwo-year-old trees, planted with a spade, in deeply plowed, thoroughly\r\nprepared ground, and would cultivate until they die of old age. I use a\r\nsixteen-inch disc, Acme harrow, Thomas's smoothing harrow, and Barnes's\r\nweeder. I grow small fruit and vegetables among the trees until of\r\nbearing age. Would plant windbreaks of six or eight rows of North\r\nCarolina poplars, honey and black locust, Russian mulberry, white ash,\r\nand box-elder, one-year seedlings, two feet apart, in rows four feet\r\napart, on the north and south side of orchard. For rabbits, I wrap my\r\ntrees as soon as possible after planting. I prune with a knife to admit\r\nsun and air, and to keep down suckers and limbs that rub each other. I\r\nthin all through the season, taking out imperfect fruit as far as\r\npossible, and it pays. I don't think it necessary to mix varieties to\r\ninsure fruitfulness, yet this spring I planted 1000 Missouri Pippins,\r\nfilling every sixth row with Winesaps for a test. The varieties I have\r\ndiscarded as not bearing were thoroughly mixed in with other kinds. I\r\nwould use no fertilizers unless on very thin soil, and then would prefer\r\nto use before planting. I use fertilizers after the trees come into\r\nbearing, but up to bearing age good, thorough cultivation in the early\r\npart of the season is all that I would give. I do not pasture orchards;\r\nit might be advisable to turn hogs in to eat up windfalls affected with\r\ncodling-moth, but never any other stock.\r\n\r\nAm troubled only with root aphis, codling-moth, and curculio. I spray\r\nright after the blossoms fall with London purple, for codling-moth, and\r\nhave reduced them to a great extent. Have prevented borers by wrapping.\r\nI contemplate using kerosene emulsion on curculio and insects that I\r\ncannot reach with poison. I pick in canvas lined half-bushel baskets,\r\nand sort into firsts, seconds, and culls, carefully, by hand. I pack in\r\nboxes, if I can get them; have used barrels well shaken and pressed\r\ndown, marked with stencil, and shipped by rail. Denver has been our best\r\nmarket thus far; sometimes I have sold most of my apples in the orchard;\r\nnever have to peddle any. I feed the culls to my hogs. Never dry any,\r\nbut think I will try it in the near future, as there is a good home\r\nmarket for a large part of them. Have stored a good many in cellar in\r\nbarrels and in bulk; some I have buried. I don't like either plan, and\r\nam figuring to put up some kind of cold-storage building for future use.\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, and Ben Davis, in the order named, have kept\r\nbest for me, my losses being about one-fifth. I irrigate by flooding the\r\nground all over thoroughly when necessary. Prices have ranged from 75\r\ncents to $1.25 per bushel; from $2.50 to $3 per barrel. I use the best\r\nmen I can get, and pay $1 a day and board, or $1.50 per day without\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. W. SWITZER, Hutchinson, Reno county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears; have 2000 apple trees twelve, fifteen and eighteen years old.\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis for market purposes; Maiden's\r\nBlush, Rambo and Roman Stem added for family use. Have discarded Limber\r\nTwig and Willow Twig, both subject to blight. I prefer bottom land,\r\nsandy loam soil, and sandy subsoil; north slope is best. Plant\r\ntwo-year-old, low-headed trees, in holes large enough to receive all the\r\nroots without crowding, one inch deeper than in the nursery. Plant to\r\ncorn until five or six years of age; then nothing. Plow and cultivate\r\nboth ways to kill the weeds. I believe windbreaks are a necessity, and\r\nshould be made of trees planted two or three rods wide, four feet apart,\r\non the south side. Wrap the trees with straw or hay to protect from\r\nrabbits and borers. I prune with a saw to thin out where too thick, and\r\nto keep down the watersprouts; it certainly pays. I use stable litter\r\nand old hay in the orchard for fertilizer. Do not think it pays or is\r\nadvisable to pasture orchard. I spray when the bloom begins to fall,\r\nthree times for codling-moth, with London purple and Paris green, and I\r\nam satisfied I have reduced them. For the borer I use a knife and a\r\nwire. I pick in baskets, and pile in long rows in the orchard. I sort\r\ninto two classes, and sell the best in the orchard to men who haul them\r\nwest. The culls go for cider. I do not irrigate, and I do not dry or\r\nstore any apples. Prices have varied from twenty-five cents to one\r\ndollar per bushel. I use common farm labor at fifteen to eighteen\r\ndollars per month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. C. CURRAN, Curran, Harper county. I have lived in Kansas fifteen\r\nyears. Have fifty apple trees eleven years old. For commercial orchard I\r\nprefer Ben Davis, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and York Imperial, and for\r\nfamily orchard add some summer and fall varieties. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Rawle's Janet, on account of slow growth. Bellflower is a fall\r\napple here; and Jonathan is too small. I prefer bottom land, sandy loam,\r\nsubirrigated, water at six feet. I prefer good two-year-old trees, head\r\ntwenty-eight inches from the ground, planted in spring, after March\r\nwinds. I cultivate my orchard all the time with a disc drawn by four\r\nhorses. I plant no crop. Have some weeds and rabbits. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of mulberries planted not closer than forty\r\nfeet to the first row of trees; would buy the mulberry sprouts from the\r\nnursery. I keep the rabbits down with dogs and shot-guns; dig borers\r\nout. I never thin my apples; the wind does it for me. I fertilize my\r\norchard with barn-yard litter, but think it injurious to the trees. Do\r\nnot pasture my orchard. Trees are troubled with canker-worm and\r\ntent-caterpillar, and fruit with curculio. I do not spray. Pick apples\r\nby hand. Never dry apples; it does not pay. Do not irrigate.

For market I\r\nprefer Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Winesap, and for a family orchard\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, Stark, and Cooper's Early White. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded the Nonesuch. I prefer bottom land with a deep loam that goes\r\nto water, with a north aspect. I prefer two-year-old trees set sixteen\r\nfeet apart. I plant my orchard to corn for about eight years, using a\r\ndisc harrow; and cease cropping at the end of that time. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; I would make them of Osage orange, Russian mulberries, or\r\ncottonwood, by planting all around the orchard, making it the heaviest\r\non the south side. For rabbits I wrap the young trees with corn-stalks,\r\nand borers I dig out. I prune with pruning-shears and a chisel to\r\nincrease the fruit; I think it pays. I thin my fruit while on the trees\r\nin June and July, and find it pays. My trees are in mixed plantings. I\r\ndo not fertilize my orchard, but would advise it on all soils. I do not\r\npasture my orchard; do not think it advisable; it does not pay. My trees\r\nare troubled with flathead borer, and my fruit with codling-moth. I do\r\nnot spray. I hand-pick my apples in a sack, one corner of which is tied\r\nup to the top, it has a strap eighteen inches long to put over the\r\nshoulder; spread the top of the sack and pick with both hands. Sort my\r\napples into two classes: first and second. I pick the best first,\r\nletting the inferior ones stay on the trees; I afterwards shake these\r\noff and send to the cider mill. I sell apples in the orchard. Make cider\r\nand vinegar of the second and third grades and culls. My best market is\r\nat home in the orchard. Never tried distant markets. Do not dry any;\r\ncannot find a ready market for them and it does not pay. Am successful\r\nin storing apples for winter use in bulk, in an outside cave; find the\r\nLittle Red Romanite and Missouri Pippin keep best. I do not irrigate.\r\nPrices have been from sixty to seventy-five cents per bushel.

Have an apple orchard of fifty trees. I am not keeping them for\r\nthe fruit, but for the pleasure of the birds--to build nests and sing\r\ntheir sweet songs in. I cultivate my orchard all the time to keep the\r\nweeds down; plant it to vines, such as squashes, pumpkins, melons, etc.\r\nDo not pasture my orchard. I do not know of anybody that ever irrigated.\r\nIn regard to \"the Kansas Apple,\" in this part of the state, they are no\r\ngood. I will say there never was ten bushels of apples grown in Seward\r\ncounty. I planted out two acres of apple trees ten years ago; they grew,\r\nand looked very well. I took good care of them, but they never would\r\nbear; and that is the experience of every one else. I cannot tell the\r\ncause, unless it gets too dry and hot, with hot winds. [Such things were\r\nsaid of the whole state of Kansas by many intelligent men thirty years\r\nago. Mr. Jones does not tell what varieties he tried, and his remarks\r\nneed not discourage any whose lot is cast in Seward county. While there\r\nare only 1034 apple trees reported in the whole county, yet the low\r\nprice of trees should encourage every farmer to plant a few of the\r\nhardier varieties, if only as an experiment.--Secretary.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOSEPH BAINUM, Langdon, Reno county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-five\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of twenty trees, most of them ten years\r\nold. For market I prefer Missouri Pippin and Winesap, and for family\r\nwould add Early Pennock and Maiden's Blush. Ben Davis would not do any\r\ngood for me. I prefer bottom or table land with a heavy subsoil and a\r\nnorthern slope. I prefer two-year-old trees with low heads, set in a\r\nditch. I cultivate my orchard to corn as long as I can get in with a\r\nplow; I also use a disc and harrow. I cease cropping when the trees need\r\nall the moisture; do not plant anything in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks\r\nare essential; would make them of mulberry trees, set thirty or forty\r\nfeet away from the orchard. For rabbits I use axle grease and sulphur\r\nmixed. I prune, leaving the tops low, and thin out the branches so as to\r\ngive air and produce larger fruit; it has paid me. I fertilize my\r\norchard with stable litter but do not put it close to the trees; I think\r\nit beneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. I have pastured my\r\norchard with cattle and hogs; do not think it advisable; it does not\r\npay. Trees are troubled with flathead borer and leaf-roller, and my\r\napples with codling-moth. I have sprayed, but not lately, with London\r\npurple for codling-moth, just after the blossoms fell; it did not\r\npay--did not reduce the codling-moth any. I go after insects not\r\naffected by spraying with a small wire. I pick my apples by hand in\r\nhalf-bushel baskets; sort into three classes--largest and sound, second\r\nbest, and cider. I wholesale, retail, and peddle, and make the culls\r\ninto cider and vinegar. Never have tried distant markets. I dry some\r\nwith a Stutzman dryer; it is satisfactory. I pack them in cracker boxes\r\nand find a ready market for them at times; it does not pay. Am\r\nsuccessful in storing apples two feet deep in bins, one above another,\r\nin a cellar walled up with rock; never tried any excepting Missouri\r\nPippin and Winesap. I have to repack stored apples before marketing,\r\nlosing about five per cent. I irrigate my orchard with water pumped into\r\na reservoir 80x120 feet, and three feet deep.

DRAKE, Bucklin, Ford county: Have lived in Kansas twenty years,\r\nand have 330 apple trees from three to eleven years old, part of them\r\nten inches in diameter. I prefer good keeping apples for family use. I\r\nprefer bottom land, subirrigated, with a north and east slope. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old trees, set the same depth as they grow in the nursery. I\r\ncultivate my orchard from three to eight years, in potatoes, with a plow\r\nand harrow; I plant nothing in a bearing orchard, and cease cropping\r\nwhen they shade the ground. Windbreaks are essential where orchards are\r\nexposed. I would make them of forest-trees. I protect from rabbits by\r\nwrapping with poultry wire. I dig borers out. I prune very little, just\r\nenough to stop top growth; I think it has been beneficial. I thin my\r\napples when the limbs are unable to support them. I mulch only to hold\r\nback the bloom. I do not pasture my orchard. Borers trouble my trees. My\r\napples are not troubled with insects. I pick my apples by hand, and put\r\nthem carefully into a basket. I sort into two classes: first, sound and\r\nsmooth; second, unsound. I do this work by hand. I pack in barrels,\r\npressed full. My best market is at home; we eat and cook the best, and\r\nthe culls I donate to the children. I never dry any. I store some in\r\nbarrels, and am successful.

I plant\r\ntwo-year-old thrifty trees in rows two rods apart. I grow nothing in the\r\norchard, and never cease cultivating with a stirring plow, disc, and\r\nharrow. I believe windbreaks are essential in this county, and would\r\nmake them of any thrifty forest-tree; Russian mulberry is good. I would\r\nput double rows around the orchard. I prune with shears and saw to thin\r\nthe tops. I never use any fertilizer, and never allow stock in the\r\norchard. Am troubled some with the flat-headed borer, which I remove\r\nwith a knife. I spray with London purple just as the bloom begins to\r\nfall. I pick by hand, and sell in the orchard and otherwise; never dried\r\nany.

I cultivate my orchard to corn and garden-truck;\r\ncultivate four or five times during a season, the more the better; I use\r\na disc; believe an orchard should always be cultivated.

For\r\nrabbits I use wrappers of wood veneer. I prune to shape the tree and to\r\nget rid of all surplus wood, and think it beneficial. I do not thin my\r\nfruit on the trees; the insects and wind do it for me. I do not pasture\r\nmy orchard. My trees are troubled with flathead borer and twig-borer,\r\nand my apples with codling-moth. I have sprayed with London purple.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nL. L. LOVETTE, Toronto, Woodson county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-two years; have an apple orchard of thirty trees twelve to twenty\r\nyears old. For market I prefer Missouri Pippin and Winesap, and for\r\nfamily use would add Early Harvest and Smith's Cider. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Fall Pippin, Northern Spy, and Rambo. I prefer level prairie\r\nland well enriched, with black limestone soil and a sandy subsoil,\r\nnorthern aspect, to hold the trees back in the spring. I prefer large,\r\nsmooth trees with good roots, planted in large holes with rotten chip\r\nmanure. I cultivate my orchard to hoed crops, using a diamond plow. I\r\nplant bearing orchard to white beans, peanuts, etc., and cease cropping\r\nwhen well in bearing. Windbreaks are essential; I use soft maple four\r\nfeet apart, in four rows around the orchard. For rabbits I wrap my trees\r\nwith slough grass. I pasture my orchard with hogs, and think it\r\nadvisable. My trees are troubled with tent-caterpillar and borers, and\r\nmy apples with curculio. I sprayed once with Bordeaux mixture; have no\r\nfaith in it; I may possibly have reduced the codling-moth a little. I\r\nnow watch and burn the insects. [?] I pick my apples in a sack over the\r\nleft shoulder, from a step-ladder wide at the bottom and narrow at the\r\ntop. Sort into three classes: first take out all inferior for cider,\r\nthen put the sound ones in the barn until late in the fall, when I\r\nsort, keeping No. 1's for spring, No. 2's for winter, and use all the\r\nrest for cider. I sell some apples in the orchard to neighbors, and some\r\nto grocerymen. I haul my best apples to market in a spring wagon with\r\nhay under them. We use many culls and give some away. My best market is\r\nat home. I dry some for market, then put them in sacks and keep in a\r\ncool place; find a ready market for them, but it does not pay. I store\r\napples for winter market in a pit; am successful; find Winesap, Rawle's\r\nJanet and Missouri Pippin keep best. We have to repack stored apples\r\nbefore marketing, losing about ten per cent. of them. I water my trees\r\nartificially. Prices have been from $1 to $1.50 per bushel. I employ\r\nyoung men at one dollar per day and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nB. F. COX, Fowler, Meade county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-one\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 125 trees ten years old, six to ten\r\ninches in diameter. For family orchard I prefer Early Harvest, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Ben Davis, Gennetting, and Rawle's Janet. I prefer hill land,\r\nwith a northeast slope, having a clay subsoil. I prefer two-year-old\r\ntrees, set at crossing of furrows run both ways. I cultivate my orchard\r\nall the time with a plow and harrow; it is too dry in this climate to\r\nlet weeds grow. Do not plant any crop. Windbreaks are essential; would\r\nmake them of African tamarix, set in three or four rows around the\r\norchard. For rabbits I grease lightly in the fall and wash off in the\r\nspring. I prune my young orchard with a knife, to balance the tree\r\nproperly. I think it pays. Never have thinned the fruit while on the\r\ntrees. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard with\r\nbarn-yard litter. I think it has been beneficial, and would advise its\r\nuse on all clay soils. I do not pasture my orchard. My trees are\r\ntroubled with tent-caterpillar and roundhead borer, and my apples with\r\nworms. I spray when in bloom, and again after blooming, with London\r\npurple. Do not think I have reduced the codling-moth any. I pick my\r\napples by hand, and sort into two classes--family apples and hog apples.\r\nAm successful in storing apples for winter use in boxes in a cellar. I\r\nfind Ben Davis and Rawle's Janet keep best. I irrigate my orchard, using\r\na windmill and pump with a four-inch cylinder. Prices have been from\r\nfifty cents to one dollar per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. JAMES MYERS, Hutchinson, Reno county: Have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-nine years. Have about 3000 apple trees eight years old, six to\r\neight inches in diameter; fine, large trees. For market I prefer\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, and Ben Davis; for home use, Early Harvest,\r\nNorthern Spy, and Maiden's Blush. Most other varieties that are a\r\nsuccess in the East are a failure here. I am satisfied with a few of the\r\nbest varieties. In this county lowland is the best. I prefer a sandy\r\nland, on a clay subsoil, and a north slope, every time. I plant two- and\r\nthree-year-old, clean, thrifty trees. I mark the ground in squares of\r\none rod and plant in every other crossing, mismatching to make the trees\r\nzigzag. I will cultivate the orchard for forty years in this county if\r\nthey live so long. I would grow corn amongst them for the first three or\r\nfour years; after that, nothing; the less crop the better. I believe\r\nwindbreaks are essential in small orchards, but in large orchards the\r\ntrees will protect each other. For windbreaks I would plant maple or\r\nmulberry, at least two rods away from the apple trees. For protection\r\nagainst rabbits and borers, take lime and Portland cement, equal parts,\r\nmix with sweet milk to the consistency of paint; add one tablespoonful\r\nof Paris green, and apply with a brush; it will never fail. I prune\r\nwhile the tree is young; then the wound does not affect them so much; it\r\npays, and is very necessary. I have never thinned, but think it\r\nnecessary, just before the apples are half grown. I use no fertilizer\r\nwhatever. I do not pasture my orchard much, but when I do it is with\r\nhogs, and I think it advisable when the fruit is wormy and falling off.\r\nI have some insects, but have never sprayed. For borers I use a knife. I\r\npick in baskets, just as late as possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. O. EMERY, Cimarron, Gray county: Have lived in Kansas twelve years;\r\nhave 400 apple trees four years planted, of the following varieties: Ben\r\nDavis, Missouri Pippin, Arkansas Black, Mammoth Black Twig, Rawle's\r\nJanet, and a few Yellow Transparent. Prefer bottom land in this county;\r\nplant only fifteen feet apart each way on account of the wind. Grow no\r\ncrop in the orchard, and cultivate every two weeks until the 1st of\r\nAugust with a five-tooth cultivator. Have a double row of locusts and\r\nOsage-orange hedge all around the orchard, and consider windbreaks a\r\nnecessity. I prune out the inside branches, leaving only four or five\r\nlimbs, so they will not grow scrubby, and think it beneficial. I plowed\r\nunder forty loads of stable litter to the acre before planting. I would\r\nnot pasture an orchard. Am troubled some with web-worm and twig-borer,\r\nand have used a spray in June and August of concentrated lye and cold\r\nwater; also, some Paris green and London purple for worms. I irrigate my\r\norchard once every two weeks, from a reservoir 70x140 feet, and have\r\napple trees that made 4-1/2 feet of growth last year. My reservoir is\r\nsupplied by two windmills running four- and six-inch pumps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBEN. McCULLOGH, Ellinwood, Barton county: Have been in Kansas twenty-two\r\nyears; have the biggest grove in Comanche township, Barton county,\r\ncovering twenty acres, most of it in fruit of all kinds. Have 300 apple\r\ntrees, planted from five to fourteen years, from eight to sixteen inches\r\nin diameter; varieties, Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Winesap, and Rawle's\r\nJanet. Have discarded the Nonesuch. My orchard is second bottom, black,\r\nsandy soil, and perfectly level. I planted two-year-old trees in rows\r\nboth ways. I grow corn and potatoes in the orchard until the trees shade\r\nthe ground pretty well, and then I grow nothing, but cultivate the\r\nground until they get big and old enough to go without it. I believe\r\nwindbreaks are essential in this country; mine is composed of three rows\r\naround the orchard, of box-elder and cottonwood. I wrap my trees while\r\nsmall to protect from the rabbits. Wash with lye for borers. While small\r\nI prune out the middle of the tree with knife and saw, but let the lower\r\nlimbs grow to protect the trunk. I believe stable litter beneficial in\r\nan orchard, and use plenty of it. I do not believe in pasturing an\r\norchard. I never spray. I always sell my fruit in the orchard; some\r\nwagons come forty miles for it, and pay me from fifty to seventy-five\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nB. LEONHART, Kiowa, Barber county: Have lived in Kansas thirteen years.\r\nHave 300 apple trees, planted from nine to ten years. Am uncertain as to\r\nbest varieties. Plant in low ground or a \"draw\"; advise any loose soil,\r\nbut no clay subsoil (?); like east or northern slope. Plant fresh\r\none-year-old trees, in \"deep subsoil trenched.\" Have planted root grafts\r\neighteen inches long, where they are now growing, and are the pride of\r\nmy orchard. Hot sun and wind make the fruit woody and sapless. Plant no\r\ncrop in orchard, but plow yearly and harrow all summer. Believe in\r\nwindbreaks made of locust or anything that will grow, planted in deep\r\nsubsoiled furrows on south and west of orchard. For rabbits I use, in\r\nsummer, lime, grass, and cow-dung, mixed. In winter I use clay with dead\r\nrabbit pounded into it. Prune to keep limbs from rubbing, and shorten in\r\nfor bearing; not sure that either pays. Plant permanent orchard, and\r\nfill between with early-bearing varieties like Missouri Pippin,\r\nJonathan, etc. [presumably to cut out afterward]. Use no fertilizers.\r\nNever let stock run in orchard. Encourage the birds, and spray some\r\nyears with London purple and Bordeaux mixture before and after leafing\r\nout. Think I have reduced codling-moth. Thrifty trees never contain\r\nborers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. L. LIGGITT, Belpre, Edwards county: Has resided in Kansas thirty\r\nyears; has a family orchard of 125 trees, planted from three to thirteen\r\nyears, and advises Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, and Jefferis. For\r\ncommerce he recommends Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin. Prefers valley\r\nland sloping east or west, with sandy soil and clay subsoil. Plants\r\nsixteen feet east and west, and thirty-two feet north and south, after a\r\nlister. Plants to corn and beans for fifteen years, lessening the number\r\nof rows as the trees grow; uses a one-horse cultivator. Thinks a\r\nwindbreak a necessity, and would make of evergreens, if possible; next,\r\nof box-elder, planted four feet each way after deep listing. Uses axle\r\ngrease against rabbits. Prunes sparingly for shape, and says it\r\ncertainly pays. Thinks thinning should frequently be done when trees\r\nappear to be overloaded. Believes trees should be in mixed plantings to\r\nproduce best. Uses barn-yard litter to fertilize, and says it will pay,\r\nif scattered over the entire surface. Believes that pasturing with hogs\r\nis advisable, and makes the trees more productive. Has never sprayed,\r\nand is seldom troubled with leaf-eating insects. Removes borers with a\r\nwire or some pointed instrument twice a year. Picks from step-ladder by\r\nhand into baskets or buckets. Makes three classes--first, perfect in\r\nform and color; second, sound but not so regular in size; third, culls.\r\nPacks in three-bushel barrels carefully by hand, marked with name of\r\nvariety and quality or class. Sells any way possible. Has shipped\r\nsuccessfully to Missouri river cities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. CLAY HODGSON, Little River, Rice county: Has been in the state\r\ntwenty-six years. Has an orchard of 5000 trees, planted from five to\r\ntwenty years. Uses Winesap, Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin for both\r\ncommercial and family orchard. Has tried and discarded Willow Twig,\r\nLawver and Smith's Cider on account of blight. Says bottom land of black\r\nloam, with clay subsoil, is preferable in this section. Plants\r\ntwo-year-old trees, in trenches made with plow and subsoiler. Cultivates\r\nwith disc and harrow, from one to twelve years, growing corn for first\r\nfive to eight years, afterward nothing. Thinks windbreaks made of\r\nseveral rows of Osage orange or box-elder on south side a great help.\r\nPrunes while young to make a more open head. Advises the use of manure\r\non all orchards. Does not allow stock in the orchard. As soon as the\r\nleaves appear he sprays with London purple for canker-worms, and\r\nbelieves he has reduced codling-moth by it. Picks in sacks, with corners\r\ntied together and hung over the shoulder. Makes two classes, market and\r\nculls. Piles his apples as picked in the orchard, and sorts out for\r\nmarket from the piles, leaving the culls for cider. Sells mostly in\r\norchard. Best market is home towns; never shipped any. Stores some in a\r\ncave, in bulk, for winter, and makes a success of it. Winesaps keep\r\nbest. Sold last fall (1897) at 75 cents per bushel; during winter, at $1\r\nto $1.25.

HUFF, Sharon, Barber county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-eight\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 130 trees ten years old. For commercial\r\npurposes I prefer Ben Davis, Large Romanite, and Missouri Pippin, and\r\nfor family orchard Missouri Pippin, Little Romanite, Limber Twig, and\r\nWinesap. I prefer level land with sand as deep as I can get it, with\r\n[natural] subirrigation. I use strong, thrifty trees, set in furrows\r\nplowed as deeply as possible, and then dug out. I cultivate my young\r\norchard to corn with one-horse, five-tooth cultivator, as long as I can\r\nget in the orchard, and cease cropping only when they commence bearing,\r\nand plant nothing after that. Windbreaks are essential, and I would make\r\nthem of Russian mulberry or box-elder, set six feet apart in rows\r\nrunning east and west, on the north and south sides. I protect from\r\nrabbits by wrapping with corn-stalks, and use lye for borers. I prune\r\nvery little with a saw to keep out watersprouts, hardly enough to pay\r\nhere in Kansas. Do not thin the fruit on my trees; it thins itself. I do\r\nnot need to fertilize; would advise it on clay soil. I never pasture my\r\norchard; do not think it advisable, unless you wish to destroy your\r\ntrees. My trees are troubled with flathead borer, and my apples with\r\ncurculio. Never have sprayed; insects not affected by spraying I gouge\r\nout with a wire, and apply concentrated lye in April and August. I pick\r\nmy apples from ladders set up around the trees, one with four legs made\r\nsolid, with steps on one side and a broad board on top to set baskets\r\non. I sort into four classes, keeping those of a uniform size separate\r\nfrom the small ones. I keep my apples in an apple house. I generally\r\nsell in the orchard; always get $1.50 for my best, packed in boxes and\r\nsold at the nearest towns, at retail. I make cider for vinegar of the\r\nculls. My best market is at home; never tried distant markets. Never dry\r\nany; it does not pay. I store all I do not sell in orchard, in a cellar\r\n12x16 feet, six feet in the ground, with earth on top; they do not\r\nfreeze. I find the Winesap, Limber Twig and Little Romanite keep best.\r\nWe do not have to repack stored apples before marketing; only lose about\r\none per cent. I do not irrigate. Prices have been $1.25 per bushel. I\r\nhire no help; my own family does the work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. F. REEVE, Greensburg, Kiowa county: I have lived in Kansas twenty\r\nyears; I prefer Missouri Pippins for a commercial orchard. I like a\r\nsandy bottom with a north slope. I prefer two- or three-year-old trees\r\nhaving bright bark; plant them by throwing out a deep furrow, and then\r\nmaking large holes in the furrow. I cultivate my orchard with a\r\none-horse cultivator, planting no crop, and keep the orchard clean,\r\nnever stopping cultivation. Windbreaks are essential; I would make them\r\nof Russian mulberry or Osage orange, on the north, west and south sides\r\nof the orchard, especially on the south. I do not prune my trees, nor\r\nthin my apples. I do not fertilize my orchard, and would not advise it\r\nin this section. I do not pasture my orchard. My trees are troubled with\r\ntent-caterpillar. Have not sprayed. Sort my apples into one class, cut\r\nout the rot, and make into apple dumplings [?]. Never sell apples in the\r\norchard; keep them all for home use; my best market is at home. I do not\r\ndry any for market; they sometimes dry on the trees, the effect of hot\r\nwinds. This is not very satisfactory, and does not pay. I do not store\r\nany for market. I do not irrigate. Prices have been from seventy-five\r\ncents to one dollar per bushel; dried apples, eight and one-third cents\r\nper pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG. W. HOLLENBACK, Coldwater, Comanche county: I have resided in the\r\nstate thirty-seven years; have an apple orchard of 200 trees from six to\r\nnine years old, four to eight inches in diameter. For market I prefer\r\nMissouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Winesap, and for family orchard Maiden's\r\nBlush, Smith's Cider, and Grimes's Golden Pippin. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Rawle's Janet on account of poor quality, and Willow Twig on\r\naccount of shy bearing. I prefer a northeast slope, with sandy loam and\r\nclay subsoil; bottom causes the trees to grow too rank. I prefer two-\r\nor three-year-old trees with low, well-balanced tops, set thirty feet\r\neach way. I give my orchard thorough cultivation, on account of lack of\r\nmoisture; I will continue indefinitely using a plow and corn cultivator,\r\nand plant nothing. Windbreaks are essential; I would make them of double\r\nrow of peach trees on south side, to keep the trees in shape. I prune to\r\ngive form; I think it pays, as they would become too dense if not\r\npruned. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees, but think some\r\nvarieties would be better if they were. My trees are planted with each\r\nvariety in a separate row. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter;\r\nthink it beneficial, but would not advise its use on all soils. I do not\r\npasture my orchard. Flathead borers are in my trees, but if they are\r\nkept thrifty the borers will give little trouble. My apples are troubled\r\nwith codling-moths. I do not spray. I pick my apples by hand and sell in\r\nbulk in the local market. I do not dry any. I am quite successful in\r\nstoring apples in pits for winter use; the Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis\r\nand Winesap keep the best. I do not irrigate.

I prefer two-year-old trees, four feet\r\nhigh, branched low, planted 24x24 feet, in a furrow plowed very deeply,\r\nnorth and south. I plant my orchard to corn, using a cultivator, plow,\r\nand cutaway harrow, and cease cropping when the trees need all the\r\nsupport. Windbreaks are a benefit; I would make them of white or green\r\nash and mulberry, by planting and cultivating three or four rows on the\r\nsouth and west. For rabbits I wrap the trees with rags, long straw, or\r\ngrass. I prune just enough to balance the head; I think it pays and that\r\nit is beneficial. My trees are in mixed plantings.

I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old whole-root trees, set twenty feet east and west and thirty\r\nfeet north and south. I cultivate my orchard to garden vegetables, such\r\nas cabbage, tomatoes, etc., using a one-horse cultivator; have not\r\nceased cropping yet. Windbreaks are essential, and I would make them of\r\ntwo rows of locusts, close together, all around, excepting on the east\r\nside of the orchard. I prune with a saw to thin the top; I think it has\r\npaid. I never thin fruit on the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings,\r\nand think it best.

I prefer\r\ncreek bottom with a loose and porous soil and subsoil. Young trees\r\nshould not be headed too low, as the lower limbs will lay on the ground\r\nwhen the tree gets older and begins to bear. I cultivate my trees until\r\ntoo large, using a disc harrow.

I prune my trees, but have not\r\nhad enough experience to tell whether it is beneficial or not. I thin my\r\nfruit while on the trees to prevent the limbs from breaking. I do not\r\nfertilize; it is not needed here. I do not pasture my orchard; it is not\r\nadvisable. My apples are troubled with codling-moth and curculio.

I plant my\r\norchard to garden-truck, using a disc harrow, and cease cropping when\r\nthey begin to bear. I plant nothing in a bearing orchard, but keep up\r\nthe cultivation to keep the ground clean and loose. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of cottonwood, box-elder, and Osage orange,\r\nputting a belt of timber around the orchard. For rabbits I wrap with\r\ncorn-stalks in the fall. I prune with knife and shears to keep the tree\r\nin shape; I think it pays. I never have thinned the fruit while on the\r\ntree, but think it would pay on some varieties. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith stable litter while I am cropping the ground; but would not advise\r\nits use unless you have plenty of water. I do not pasture my orchard; it\r\nis not advisable, and does not pay. My trees are troubled with\r\ntwig-borer, canker-worm, and leaf-roller, and my fruit with\r\ncodling-moth. I spray when the bloom falls, and ten days later, with\r\nLondon purple, for codling-moth; and I think I have reduced them. Borers\r\ndo not trouble my trees when they have plenty of water.

Windbreaks are essential on the south and west sides\r\nof the orchard, and I would make them of Osage orange or box-elder,\r\nplanted ten feet apart. For rabbits I wrap the trees with slough grass\r\nuntil six years old. I prune lightly, taking out the limbs which rub\r\neach other and balancing the trees. I think it pays. I do not thin the\r\napples while on the tree. I do not fertilize my orchard; it is not\r\nneeded in this locality. I pasture my orchard with horses and pigs, and\r\nthink it advisable. I find it does not injure the trees. My apples are\r\ntroubled with codling-moth. I do not spray. I pick by hand for storing,\r\nand sort into two classes, the good and the bad ones; the bad I make\r\ncider of and feed to hogs. I generally sell my best apples in the\r\norchard on the trees, or any way I can. We sun-dry some apples, and find\r\na ready market for them. It pays. I am fairly successful in keeping\r\napples in bulk in a cave, and find Ben Davis and Rawle's Janet keep\r\nbest. I irrigate a few trees. Prices have been from twenty cents to one\r\ndollar per bushel, and dried apples six to seven cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. T. EVERHART, Pratt, Pratt county: I have lived in the state twenty\r\nyears. For a family orchard I prefer Missouri Pippin, on sandy bottom\r\nland, with a north slope. I plant two-year-old trees, deeply. I plant my\r\norchard to potatoes for five years, using a plow. Plant nothing in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of rows of\r\nRussian mulberries planted every six feet. I prune only to keep the tree\r\nin shape. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. Cannot see any\r\ndifference whether the trees are in blocks of a kind or in mixed\r\nplantings. I do not fertilize; would not advise its use on the soil\r\nhere. I pasture my orchard with hogs; think it advisable, and that it\r\npays. My trees are troubled with borers and sun-scald. I spray my trees\r\nwhen in bloom, and after it has fallen, with London purple only. My best\r\nmarket is at home; never have tried distant markets. I irrigate my trees\r\non the upland four or five months. Prices have been from 75 cents to\r\n$1.50 per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES CRAIG, Garden City, Finney county: Have been in Kansas nineteen\r\nyears. Have an orchard of 1300 trees, planted twelve years, trees\r\nrunning from twelve to eighteen feet high. Cultivate up to this time\r\nwith twenty-inch disc harrow, and grow no crop. Windbreaks are essential\r\nin this county. I would not allow stock in my orchard. I dig out the\r\nborers, and intend to try spraying this year. I pick by hand, and sell\r\nlargely in the orchard. My best market is Garden City. I make cider and\r\nvinegar of the culls. I have never dried any. I store in bulk for\r\nwinter, and am successful in keeping the Missouri Pippin, Winesap, and\r\nBen Davis. I irrigate by flooding. The average price has been about\r\nsixty cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN BAILEY, Harper, Harper county: I have resided in Kansas twenty\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 400 trees, set sixteen years, eight to\r\ntwelve inches in diameter. For all purposes I prefer Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinesap, and Jonathan. Have tried and discarded Rawle's Janet, because\r\nthe fruit cracks open, Snow, because they are poor, and White Winter\r\nPearmain, because the tree is subject to disease. I prefer good, sandy\r\nsoil, with a northeast slope. I prefer healthy two-year-old trees, with\r\ngood roots, planted twenty-eight feet apart each way. I cultivate my\r\norchard every year with a cultivator and harrow, to keep the ground\r\nloose and mellow, and plant nothing. Windbreaks are not essential. For\r\nrabbits I wash the tree with weak lye and sulphur; have found no remedy\r\nfor borers, excepting to keep the trees healthy and growing. I prune, to\r\nlet in sun and keep the limbs from rubbing; I think it pays, and that it\r\nhas been beneficial. I thin my fruit by pulling it off when small; I\r\nthink it pays; it keeps the trees from breaking. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith stable litter; I think it beneficial, and would advise its use on\r\nall soils. I do not pasture my orchard; I do not think it advisable. My\r\ntrees are troubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, woolly aphis, and\r\ntwig-borer, and my apples with codling-moth and curculio. I spray after\r\nthe blossoms fall, and once a week for three or four weeks after that,\r\nwith London purple, for all insects. I dig borers out with a fine wire.\r\nI sort my apples into three classes--first, second, and cider. I sell my\r\napples in the orchard, wholesale, retail, and peddle. Sell the best ones\r\nin barrels. Make cider and vinegar of the culls. My best markets are at\r\nhome and Oklahoma territory. I do not dry any. I am successful in\r\nstoring apples in bulk; find the Missouri Pippin keeps best. I do not\r\nirrigate.

I cultivate my\r\norchard all the time with a disc and harrow, planting no crop.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential. I prune with a saw and knife, and think it\r\npays. Never have thinned my apples, but if it were necessary would do it\r\nbefore they begin to hang down. My trees are in mixed plantings. I mulch\r\nmy orchard with stable litter and straw; would not advise its use on all\r\nsoils. I do not pasture my orchard, but think it would be advisable, as\r\nthey would eat insects. My trees are troubled with flathead borer, and\r\nmy apples with curculio. The first of June I dig the borers out with a\r\npenknife and cut their heads off. I pick my apples by hand. I sell\r\napples in the orchard at retail; feed the culls to hogs. My best market\r\nis among the neighbors. I store apples for my own use by burying, and\r\nfind the Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis and Romanite keep best. I do not\r\nirrigate, but ought to.

MAYRATH, Dodge, Ford county: I have lived in Kansas twenty years.\r\nHave 250 apple trees eight to twelve years old, six to ten inches in\r\ndiameter. I prefer upland for fruit, a sandy loam, with a northern\r\naspect. I prefer two-year-old grafts, planted thirty by thirty feet east\r\nand west. Have tried root grafts with success. I cultivate my orchard to\r\ngarden-truck and hoed crops, using plow in spring, then the disc or Acme\r\nharrow. I keep the ground clear of weeds and mellow up to the middle of\r\nJuly. I cease cropping after four or five years, planting nothing in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential here in western Kansas, and I\r\nwould make them of Russian mulberry, in one or more rows, north and\r\nsouth of the orchard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM.

Windbreaks are essential. I would make them of two or three\r\nrows of mulberry trees. For protection from rabbits I rub dead rabbit on\r\nthe tree, and repeat if necessary when we have much rain. I prune very\r\nlittle. Do not thin the fruit while on the trees. My trees are planted\r\nin blocks. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; think it\r\nbeneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. I do not pasture my\r\norchard. I do not spray; am not troubled with insects.

For market I prefer\r\nMissouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and Jonathan. I prefer a sandy bottom, with\r\na northeast aspect. I prefer three-year-old trees set twenty feet apart,\r\nin land which has been plowed deeply and subsoiled. I cultivate my\r\norchard as long as I can get among the trees, with a disc that throws\r\ndirt out first, and one that throws dirt in second. I cease cropping\r\nafter the first year; plant nothing in a bearing orchard. I have a\r\nwindbreak made of black locust and mulberries. I prune with\r\npruning-knife and shears to form the tops. I think it pays. I do not\r\nthin my apples while on the trees. I believe all orchards should be set\r\nin mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter, and think\r\nit beneficial on sandy soil. I do not pasture my orchard; do not think\r\nit advisable; it does not pay. My trees are troubled with flathead\r\nborers and tent-caterpillars, and my apples with curculio. I do not\r\nspray. I hand-pick my apples.

I have tried and discarded Ben Davis because they died when\r\neighteen or twenty years old; they are no good here. I prefer a\r\nnortheast slope, with a sandy loam and a clay subsoil. I prefer small\r\ntwo-year-old trees, set 16x24 feet, rows running north and south. I\r\nplant my orchard to corn up to bearing age, using the plow and harrow,\r\nand plant nothing after they begin to bear, but keep up the cultivation.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; I would make them of two or three rows of\r\nRussian mulberries, on the south side of the orchard. I do not prune my\r\ntrees; it does not pay. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. My\r\ntrees are in mixed plantings. I do not fertilize my orchard. I do not\r\npasture my orchard; it is not advisable. I do not spray. I pick my\r\napples by hand, the old way; sort into two classes.

SNYDER, Towanda, Butler county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-seven\r\nyears; have an orchard of 1200 trees--200 twenty-six years old, diameter\r\ntwelve to fifteen inches, thirty feet high; 700 twelve years old, eight\r\nto ten inches in diameter at base, twelve to fifteen feet high; 300\r\neight years old, five to six inches in diameter at the ground, eight to\r\nten feet high. For all purposes I prefer Summer Rose, Early Harvest,\r\nDuchess of Oldenburg, Grimes's Golden Pippin, Jonathan, Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinesap, and Ben Davis. Bottom land is best for Ben Davis and Winesap;\r\nother varieties named will do better on high ground. Northeast slope is\r\npreferable; black loam with clay subsoil. I plant healthy three-year-old\r\ntrees, branching three feet from ground, in deep furrows, crossmarked\r\nwith plow; stand trees erect, and tramp earth firmly about the roots. I\r\ncultivate my orchard five years with plow and cultivator, and grow corn\r\nin young orchard. I cease after five years, and grow nothing in bearing\r\norchard. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of peach, Russian\r\nmulberry, or cedar, by planting several rows on south of orchard. For\r\nrabbits, fence with two-foot poultry netting; for borers, whitewash and\r\ncultivate. I prune just a little with saw or shears to remove\r\ninterlocking branches only; it pays. Never have thinned my fruit;\r\nbelieve it does not pay. Can distinguish no difference whether trees are\r\nin blocks of one kind or mixed plantings. I do not fertilize my orchard.\r\nStable litter would, I think, benefit thin soil. I do not pasture my\r\norchard; it is not advisable, and does not pay.\r\n\r\nMy apple trees are troubled with canker-worm, root aphis, and fall\r\nweb-worm. Have sprayed for fifteen years, for canker-worm and\r\ncodling-moth. Have used London purple and arsenate of lime. I spray for\r\ncanker-worm as soon as they hatch and the buds begin to open, and again\r\nbefore bloom opens; for codling-moth, at time the bloom drops. I have\r\nreduced the codling-moth very much. I pick my apples by hand, from a\r\nladder, into baskets, and sort into two classes usually; first class,\r\nfor market, picked by hand; second class, for cider, shaken off. Have\r\nnever used packages of any kind. Usually deliver in wagon. I sell apples\r\nin the orchard, wholesale and retail. Sell best to my neighbors, in\r\norchard. Second and third grades I sell cheap and convert into cider and\r\nvinegar. The culls I feed to cattle and hogs. My best market is in the\r\norchard and at Wichita; never have tried distant markets. Never dry any.\r\nSometimes I store apples for winter market in a cellar, but prefer a\r\ncave; store in boxes and bulk. Am fairly successful; have apples in\r\ncellar at this time (May 1), Missouri Pippin, Winesap, Ben Davis, and\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, in the order named. Never have tried artificial\r\ncold storage; have to repack stored apples, if late, losing from ten to\r\nfifteen per cent. I do not irrigate. Prices have been from 50 cents to\r\n$1.50 per bushel. I employ the best help I can get, and pay seventy-five\r\ncents per day and board.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. O. GRAHAM, Altoona, Wilson county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years. Have an apple orchard of forty trees from five to\r\neight years old. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Willow\r\nTwig, Rawle's Janet, and Grimes's Golden Pippin; and for family orchard\r\nI would add Maiden's Blush, Red Astrachan, and Red June. I have tried\r\nand discarded Belleflower, Limber Twig, and King of Tompkins County;\r\nthey are no good. I prefer a clay bottom, with a north or northeast\r\nslope. I prefer two-year-old, round-top trees, with whole roots, set in\r\ndug holes, in the fall or spring, as deeply as they stood in the\r\nnursery. I cultivate my orchard five to eight years, with a hoed crop,\r\nor just keep the ground clean, and sow oats and sometimes red clover in\r\na bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential; I would make them of Osage\r\norange. I prune to give shape, and to keep limbs from crossing; I think\r\nit beneficial, and that it pays. I seldom thin my fruit while on the\r\ntrees; I pick them off when the size of walnuts. My trees are in mixed\r\nplantings. I fertilize my orchard with well-rotted stable litter; put it\r\nbetween the rows; it has proven very beneficial; I would advise it on\r\nall soils, but less of it on bottom land. I never pasture my orchard,\r\nexcepting with pigs, to eat the oats or clover, which I think advisable,\r\nand that it pays.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with bark-louse, twig-borer, web-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, and canker-worm, and my apples with codling-moth and\r\ncurculio. I spray my trees while in bloom, and two or three times\r\nafterward, with London purple and some Paris green; have greatly reduced\r\nthe codling-moth. For rabbits I wrap the trees with corn-stalks and tie\r\nwith a string. Borers I dig out, and then with a goose-quill or a spray\r\nnozzle I blow insecticides into the hole. I pick my apples by hand into\r\nsacks or pails from a step-ladder; sort into three classes; pack very\r\nclosely into two and one-half bushel barrels, and mark with variety and\r\ngrade; haul to market on wagon. I have sold apples in the orchard; I\r\ndispose of them any way I can; I feed culls to the hogs. My best markets\r\nare Kansas City, Denver, and Western points; have tried distant\r\nmarkets, and found it paid; but better sell at home. I do not dry many\r\napples; it does not pay for good apples. I am fairly successful in\r\nstoring apples in boxes, barrels and bulk in a cellar. I find Ben Davis,\r\nJonathan and Rawle's Janet keep best. Never tried artificial cold\r\nstorage. I have to repack stored apples before marketing, losing about\r\nten per cent. of them. I do not irrigate. Prices have been from 75 cents\r\nto $1.25 per bushel for winter apples. I employ men at one dollar per\r\nday.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFRED. WAHLENMAIER, Arkansas City, Cowley county: I have resided in the\r\nstate thirty-five years. Have an apple orchard of five acres,\r\ntwenty-four years old. I prefer Maiden's Blush for a family orchard. I\r\nprefer a sandy loam, hilltop, with a north slope. I prefer two-year-old\r\ntrees, planted thirty feet apart. I plant my young orchard to corn, and\r\nplant nothing in a bearing orchard. I prune my trees, to produce better\r\nand more fruit. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. I fertilize\r\nmy orchard with stable litter. I pasture my orchard with calves. My\r\ntrees are troubled with canker-worms and roundhead borers. I sprayed\r\nlast year for canker-worms, with coal-oil and water, when the leaves\r\nwere coming out. I wholesale my apples. Make cider of the culls. My best\r\nmarket is Arkansas City. We sun-dry some apples for our own use. I have\r\nstored some apples in the cellar; never have tried artificial cold\r\nstorage. I do not irrigate. Prices have been from twenty-five to sixty\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. R. DAVIDSON, Yates Center, Woodson county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nfifteen years; have an apple orchard with trees from five to twenty\r\nyears old. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan,\r\nWinesap, and Maiden's Blush, and for family orchard add Early Harvest.\r\nHave tried and discarded Yellow Bellflower; it will not bear. I prefer\r\nbottom land with a northern slope which has a black loam. I prefer two-\r\nor three-year-old trees, set in rows thirty feet east and west, and\r\nsixteen feet north and south. I plant my orchard with corn four or five\r\nyears, using a cultivator, and cease cropping after six or eight years;\r\nKafir-corn does well in a bearing orchard. For rabbits I think wire\r\nscreening is best. I prune my trees to let in air; think it beneficial,\r\nand that it pays. Do not thin the fruit while on the trees. I fertilize\r\nmy orchard with stable litter; it strengthens and invigorates the trees;\r\nwould advise its use on all soils unless very rich. I pasture my orchard\r\nwith calves, because they do not hurt the trees; I think it advisable,\r\nand that it pays. My trees are troubled with web-worm, and my apples\r\nwith curculio. I spray with London purple, one tablespoonful to two\r\ngallons of water, to destroy the curculio. I think I have reduced the\r\ncodling-moth. For borers I use ashes; throw them around the tree, or\r\nmake a lye of them, and wash the tree and throw some around the roots.

For commercial orchard I\r\nprefer Ben Davis, Jonathan, Rome Beauty, and Winesap, and for family\r\norchard Sweet June, Duchess of Oldenburg, Maiden's Blush, Baldwin,\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, Jonathan, Rome Beauty, and Winesap. Have tried\r\nand discarded Red Astrachan and Rambo for unproductiveness; White Winter\r\nPearmain as unproductive, short-lived, and a poor seller. I prefer for\r\nan apple orchard the best corn land, in a bottom. I prefer two-year-old\r\ntrees, with good roots not mangled, set in squares thirty feet each way.\r\nI cultivate my orchard to corn or vines, using a plow, harrow and\r\ncultivator eight or ten years in the orchard, and cease cropping after\r\nten years. I plant a bearing orchard to orchard-grass and timothy\r\n(blue-grass is injurious). Windbreaks would be an advantage on the south\r\nand west; would make them of live trees; plant Osage orange next to\r\norchard and forest-trees outside of it. For rabbits I wrap the young\r\ntrees; also shoot and trap them, especially the jacks.\r\n\r\nI prune very cautiously, and mostly on the north side, using a saw and\r\nknife, to give symmetry and keep limbs from crowding; I think it\r\nbeneficial. I fertilize portions of my orchard with stable litter; would\r\nnot advise it on all soils, as I think an orchard can be overstimulated.\r\nI have pastured the orchard with calves and hogs, but do not now; it\r\ndoes not pay; do not think it advisable. My trees are troubled with\r\ncanker-worm, flathead borer, and fall web-worm, and my apples with\r\ncodling-moth and curculio. I spray April 15 and May 10, on later date,\r\nwith London purple, for insects. Think I have reduced the codling-moth.\r\nFor insects not affected by spraying, I keep the tree in a healthy\r\ncondition. Pick my apples by hand; sort into three classes--market,\r\ncooking, and cider. I sell apples in the orchard, wholesale, retail, or\r\npeddle; sell the best apples in the orchard or to dealers; peddle the\r\nsecond and third grades; make cider of the culls. I find the nearest\r\nmarkets to be the best; never have tried distant markets. Do not dry\r\nany. Do not store any, but think I shall. Do not irrigate, but would if\r\nI had the water. Prices have been fifty cents to one dollar per bushel\r\nfor best winter apples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nH. A. CONDRA, Longton, Elk county: I have resided in Kansas twenty-one\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of seventy-five trees, twenty years old,\r\nten to sixteen inches in diameter, twenty to twenty-five feet high. I\r\nhave thirty more which are but two years old. For market I prefer Ben\r\nDavis, Winesap, Jonathan, and Missouri Pippin; and for family orchard\r\nRed Astrachan, Maiden's Blush, Rawle's Janet, Missouri Pippin, and\r\nWinesap. I prefer a bottom which has a rich loam, with a gravel subsoil\r\nand a north or east slope. I prefer two-year-old trees having but two\r\nlimbs, both starting from the same place, set in holes four to six feet\r\nin diameter, two feet deep, filled in with good dirt. I cultivate my\r\norchard to corn--so as to keep weeds down and hold moisture--use a disc\r\nharrow and cultivator so as to keep the soil loose and fine two or three\r\ninches down. I cease cropping after eight or ten years, and plant\r\nnothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are not essential. For rabbits\r\nI use tin from the roofs of burned buildings or building paper. I prune\r\nwith a saw and an ax to thin the tops and keep the limbs above my head;\r\nthink it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. My trees are\r\nplanted in blocks [of same kind]. I fertilize my orchard with any\r\nwell-rotted manure; I think it beneficial, and would advise its use on\r\nall soils, especially on old orchards. I do not pasture my orchard; do\r\nnot think it advisable; it does not pay.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, leaf-roller,\r\nand leaf-crumpler, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray when the\r\nleaves first come out, when in blossom, and once or twice afterwards,\r\nten days apart, with London purple and Bordeaux mixture for codling-moth\r\nand leaf-eating worms. Think I have reduced the codling-moth some. I\r\nstand on a step ladder and pick my apples by hand in a small basket,\r\nthen pour them into a wagon. I sort into three classes--sound,\r\nblemished, and rotten. Sound ones are put in crates, blemished are made\r\ninto cider, and the rotten ones go to the hogs. I pack in crates, for\r\nconvenience, and then store in the cellar. They are made of lath and\r\n1x12 boxing lumber. The lath are sawed across in the middle, the lumber\r\ninto lengths of fourteen inches. The bottom and sides are lath one-half\r\ninch apart. This makes an airy crate, easy to handle, two feet long,\r\nfourteen inches wide and twelve inches deep, which when rounded up will\r\nhold one and one-half bushels of apples. I sell apples in the orchard;\r\nalso retail and peddle. My best apples are usually sold in the orchard.\r\nOf the second and third grades we make cider, apple-butter, and vinegar.\r\nThe hogs get the culls. My best market is at home. I do not dry; cannot\r\nfind a ready market, and it does not pay.\r\n\r\nI am successful in storing apples in crates in a cellar which has a\r\nwareroom overhead; the walls are of sandstone two feet thick, with six\r\ninches of dry sand between the ceiling of the cellar and the floor of\r\nthe wareroom. A door is in the south end, and a window in the north,\r\nwith screens so the outside shutter is open all the time except at\r\nnoonday sun, and when raining or freezing. There is an air-shaft through\r\nceiling to roof. The racks or shelves are made of 1x4 lumber, and there\r\nis one inch of space between the crates when slipped in, thus allowing\r\nthe air to circulate around them. I have apples in the cellar now (April\r\n25) while my neighbors who stored in bulk have none fit to eat; all are\r\nrotten. I find Rawle's Janet and Winesap keep best. I have to repack\r\nstored apples before marketing, losing about one-tenth of them. I do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have averaged thirty-five cents per bushel. Dried\r\napples have been four cents for sun-dried and eight cents for\r\nevaporated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nT. H. GUEST, Grafton, Chautauqua county: I have lived in this county\r\ntwenty years. Have an apple orchard of 3000 trees ten years old. For\r\nmarket I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, White Winter Pearmain, and\r\nLittle Romanite; and for family orchard Red June, Ben Davis, Missouri\r\nPippin, Jonathan, Early Harvest, and Grimes's Golden Pippin. Have tried\r\nand discarded Bellflower and Willow Twig on account of blight. I prefer\r\nbottom land, with a black, sandy loam, clay subsoil, and northern\r\naspect. I prefer one-year-old trees--switches--planted with a lister. I\r\ncultivate my orchard to corn eight years, then use a disc harrow,\r\nrunning both ways, keeping a dust mulch; I cease cropping at bearing age\r\nand plant nothing. Never put alfalfa in an orchard. Windbreaks are not\r\nessential here. For rabbits I use lath and woven wire, and concentrated\r\nlye for borers. I prune with a saw and shears, to increase the size and\r\ncolor of the fruit; I think it beneficial, and that it pays. I never\r\nthin the fruit while on the trees, but believe it would pay. My trees\r\nare in mixed plantings; I have Gilpin or Little Romanite growing beside\r\nMissouri Pippins; they blossom the same time. At picking time in the\r\nfall I have noticed a very marked difference in the Gilpin, it having\r\nthe peculiarities of the Missouri Pippin: the increase in size, with the\r\nwhite specks and oblong shape peculiar to the Missouri Pippin. I also\r\nnoticed a difference in the Romanite for two rows in; I tried keeping\r\nsome of them until spring; some were quite mellow, and the flavor was\r\nmuch superior to that of the Romanites not near the Missouri Pippins. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with stable litter, but would not advise its use on\r\nheavy soils. Do not pasture my orchard; it is not advisable, and does\r\nnot pay. My trees are troubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, root\r\naphis, flathead borer, fall web-worm, and leaf-roller; and my apples\r\nwith codling-moth, curculio, and gouger. I spray successfully when the\r\nfruit buds appear in the spring, with Paris green, London purple and\r\nBordeaux mixture for canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, and curculio. I\r\nhand-pick my apples in sacks and baskets from step-ladders, and sort\r\ninto two classes--first and second--as we pick them; put them into two\r\ndifferent vessels, and let the culls drop. I pack my apples in\r\ntwo-bushel packages, with blossom end down, mark with the grower's and\r\nconsignee's names, and haul to market on a heavy truck. I sell some\r\napples in the orchard to buyers from the territory. I make cider and\r\nvinegar of the culls, but do not dry, store nor irrigate any. Prices\r\nhave been from twenty-five cents to one dollar per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG. W. RHODES, Lowe, Chautauqua county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-two\r\nyears. Have an orchard of 500 apple trees from five to twenty years old.\r\nFor market I prefer Ben Davis and Jonathan, and for family orchard Ben\r\nDavis, Ortley, Maiden's Blush, and Grimes's Golden Pippin. Have tried\r\nand discarded Lawver, King and Baldwin on account of shy bearing. I\r\nprefer hilltop, with deep loam, limestone soil, and clay subsoil, with\r\nnortheast slope. I prefer straight one-year-old trees, with plenty of\r\nroots, set in squares of twenty-five feet. I cultivate my orchard to\r\ncorn or potatoes while the trees are small, using a plow and cultivator,\r\nand cease cropping after ten years; plant nothing in a bearing orchard.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential, but would be beneficial; would make them\r\nof evergreens. For borers I wash the trunks of small trees with carbolic\r\nacid and strong soap-suds. I prune to thin the tops, so I can get in to\r\ngather the apples; it pays. I have thinned the fruit while on the trees,\r\nbut not lately; haven't time; but think it pays. My trees are planted in\r\nrows, each variety by itself. I fertilize my orchard with barn-yard\r\nlitter while I am cultivating; when the trees get larger I mow the grass\r\nand weeds and let lay as a mulch, and afterwards as a manure; this is\r\nall needed. Never have pastured the orchard, but think hogs with rings\r\nin their noses would be a benefit. My apples are troubled with\r\ncodling-moth. I spray after the blossom falls with arsenates, for all\r\nkinds of insects that come early, especially the codling-moth; think I\r\nhave reduced them. I pick my apples by hand from a ladder, bench, or get\r\ninto the tree. We sort into two grades, large and small; sell them in\r\nthe orchard to people from the west and Oklahoma, who haul them off in\r\nwagons. We have a great many dried apples, dried by the neighbors on\r\nshares; we find a ready market for them. I am quite successful in\r\nstoring apples in bulk in a cave arched over with stone. Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap and Missouri Pippin keep best. Prices have been from twenty-five\r\nto sixty cents per bushel in the fall, and from $1 to $1.50 in the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJASON HELMICK, Cloverdale, Chautauqua county: Has lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years. For all commercial purposes he prefers Missouri\r\nPippin and Winesap, and adds a few summer and fall varieties for family\r\nuse. Has tried and discarded Bellflower, because the fruit drops off,\r\nand Ben Davis, because it cannot stand heat and drought--the trees decay\r\nearly. He prefers north or northeast slope, bottom land, with a deep,\r\nporous soil, the more porous the better. He pastures his orchard with\r\nhorses, cattle, and hogs, and thinks it advisable if done with care; it\r\npays. His trees are troubled with tent-caterpillar, flat-headed borer,\r\nand leaf-roller, which do little damage. His greatest drawback is\r\ndrought and heat. He does not spray, and cuts borers out in August or\r\nearlier, and kills the caterpillars. Picks his apples by hand. Never\r\nsells them in the orchard; raises mostly for home use. Stores some in\r\nboxes in a cellar. Does not irrigate. Marketable apples usually sell for\r\ntwenty-five cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. W. GOODELL, Sedan, Chautauqua county: Have lived in Kansas fifteen\r\nyears; have an orchard of 200 trees, which are nine years old. For a\r\ncommercial orchard I would plant Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri\r\nPippin; and for a family orchard would add Early Harvest. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Lowell and Yellow Bellflower as too tender for the climate. I\r\nprefer bottom land having a black, sandy loam, and a northern slope,\r\nand plant one-year-old trees, thirty by thirty feet. I cultivate with a\r\ndisc, and am still cultivating, growing corn in the orchard for nine or\r\nten years. Windbreaks are essential. I would make them of natural oak if\r\npossible. For borers and rabbits I use concentrated lye and lath\r\njackets. I prune my trees with a saw and shears, and think it pays and\r\nis beneficial. I never thin apples while on the trees, and have never\r\nfertilized. Do not pasture my orchard. My trees are troubled with\r\ncanker-worm, tent-caterpillar, root aphis, fall web-worm, and\r\nleaf-roller, and my apples with codling-moth and gouger. I spray for\r\ncanker-worm and all other insects before and after the foliage appears,\r\nand think I have reduced the codling-moth. I dig the borers out with a\r\nwire and wash the tree with lye. Pick my apples into baskets, and sort\r\ninto firsts, seconds, and culls. I sell in the orchard, and make cider\r\nof the culls. Do not dry any. I store some for winter market in a cave.\r\nDo not irrigate. Prices have been from forty cents to one dollar per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. D. CHAMBERS, Hartford, Lyon county: Have been in Kansas thirty-two\r\nyears. Have 3500 apple trees; 1500 of them have been planted twenty-five\r\nyears; 2000 of them six years. I prefer for market Ben Davis, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Winesap, and for family orchard would add Early Harvest, Red\r\nAstrachan, Maiden's Blush, and Rambo. Have discarded Yellow Bellflower\r\nbecause it won't bear; Milam, because it is too small; Rawle's Janet,\r\noff on color. Only a few varieties should be in a commercial orchard. I\r\nprefer bottom land; mine slopes to the north. Any soil is good, either\r\nclay or loam. I would set thrifty two-year-old trees in furrows. I have\r\nraised thousands of root grafts in the nursery, growing my own seedlings\r\nto graft on. I cultivate in corn until they begin to show fruit, then in\r\nmillet twice; I have never cultivated the orchard without a crop. When\r\nthe ground gets bad, break it up and put in millet to shade the ground.\r\nI have never used any windbreaks; plant my trees close, to protect each\r\nother from the wind. I use axle grease for rabbits, and have had very\r\nlittle trouble with borers. I prune in the early years to shape the\r\ntree; later, to remove surplus wood, and think it increases the size of\r\nthe apple. I believe stable litter is beneficial; I have applied it only\r\non heavy clay soil. I pasture my orchard to a slight extent with horses\r\nand cows. I do not gather the down apples, but let my stock gather them.\r\nI have sprayed with London purple for canker-worm and tent-caterpillar;\r\nI use a barrel and a wagon, from first of May on, and am only partially\r\nsuccessful; I think I have reduced the codling-moth some. I pick with\r\nbaskets and wagons, and pile the apples in the orchard. I sort into\r\nthree classes--first, shipping; third, culls; second, betweens. As I\r\nsell to shippers at wholesale, I put in the first class as small ones as\r\nthe contract will allow; the second class includes all that look\r\nsalable, and I sell them in the home markets; I sell what culls I can,\r\nand make cider of the others. I do not ship any. My apples mostly go\r\nsouth. I tried shipping once, but it did not pay. I do not dry any, nor\r\nstore any for winter. Have never irrigated. Prices vary from 20 cents to\r\n$1.25 per bushel, according to variety, time of year, etc. I use men and\r\nwomen for picking, and pay three cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nB. RONEY, Benedict, Wilson county: Have lived in Kansas since the fall\r\nof 1869; have 1400 apple trees, planted from six to twenty-seven years.\r\nFor market I prefer Baldwin, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Jonathan, Ben\r\nDavis; for family, Red June, Maiden's Blush, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, and\r\nJonathan. I have discarded the Russets (the fruit is inferior), and\r\nBellflower (the trees are not hardy). I prefer north-slope upland with\r\ndeep limestone soil and clay subsoil. I plant thrifty three-year-old,\r\nnot overgrown trees with good heads, thirty feet east and west, twenty\r\nfeet north and south, to protect from the wind. I set in the spring, in\r\na rye-field or stubble ground, running out furrows and putting in with a\r\nspade. I cultivate with a small stirring plow with one horse, for the\r\nfurrows next the tree. I grow corn until the trees should bear, and then\r\nchange to red clover, and mow to keep the weeds down. I believe\r\nwindbreaks are essential, but care should be taken not to have many\r\nsoft-wood trees near the orchard to breed insects. An elevation on the\r\nsouth or southwest will be found beneficial. For rabbits, wrap in the\r\nwinter; for borers, wash with lime in the spring. Keep out all\r\nwatersprouts; thin the top of the tree, so that the sun may penetrate;\r\nbalance the top; cut out the center shoot--it pays. After trees begin to\r\nbear I would fertilize with stable litter. Hogs are good in the orchard\r\nin the spring to destroy insects, but should not be allowed to root\r\nmuch. I spray with London purple and Paris green when in full bloom [how\r\nabout bees?], and again in ten days, and give a third spray a few days\r\nafter, if any insects are on the trees. We have a good home market. For\r\nwinter I find that Rawle's Janet and Romanite keep the best. Prices have\r\nranged from forty to seventy-five cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGEO. HILDRETH, Altamont, Labette county: Have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-nine years; have an orchard of 1225 trees, from ten to\r\ntwenty-seven years old. For commercial orchard prefer Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin and Jonathan for winter, and Early Harvest and Red June\r\nfor summer; for family use I prefer Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush,\r\nRambo, Missouri Pippin, and Jonathan. Have tried and discarded Golden\r\nRusset and many others. I prefer a porous or well-drained soil, north by\r\nnortheast slope; it is too hot in bottom, and too dry on hilltop. I\r\nplant two-year-old trees in rows running north and south, trees twelve\r\nto sixteen feet apart in the row; have grown very few seedlings. I\r\ncultivate with corn while young, and rye or wheat and keep it pastured\r\ndown when bearing. I plow between rows once in fore part of July. I have\r\na tall hedge for windbreak. I prune to keep the top balanced, and do not\r\nallow it to get too thick; I think it has been beneficial. Have never\r\nthinned apples on the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings, the\r\nvarieties are Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, and others. I fertilize\r\nsometimes, I think it beneficial and would advise it on poor land. I\r\npasture my orchard with hogs and sheep, and think it advisable; it pays.\r\nHave some insects but not in great quantity. I spray with London purple\r\nafter the bloom falls off--one pound of London purple in from 50 to 100\r\ngallons of water. Think I have reduced the number of codling-moth. In\r\npicking I use a sack swung over the shoulder, and a light ladder. I\r\nclassify to suit the purchaser, doing the sorting in a cool place and\r\nusually packing the best in barrels, and sell at wholesale, often in the\r\norchard; feed the culls to hogs; never tried distant markets. I\r\nsometimes store for winter market in barrels and keep in cave surrounded\r\nwith hay; am not always successful. I find those that keep best are\r\nLittle Romanite, Rawle's Janet, Ben Davis, and Missouri Pippin; never\r\ntried artificial cold-storage. Seldom have to repack stored apples\r\nbefore marketing; lose about one-fourth. The prevailing price this year\r\nhas been fifty to seventy-five cents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. S.

I prefer for commercial purpose Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri\r\nPippin; and for family use Red June and Early Harvest. I prefer bottom\r\nland, with black loam, gravel subsoil, and northeast slope. I prefer\r\none-year-old trees, set sixteen feet at first; thin to thirty-two feet.\r\nI cultivate my young orchard with potatoes and strawberries for ten\r\nyears, then sow to clover, plowing again in two years; I never cease\r\ncropping; cultivate with plow, disc, and harrow. I wrap the trees for\r\nrabbits. I prune with a saw and knife, and think it beneficial. I never\r\nthin apples. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter, but would not\r\nadvise it on all soils. I pasture my orchard with hogs and calves, and\r\nthink it advisable, and that it pays. My trees are troubled with\r\ntent-caterpillar, and my apples with codling-moth. I spray for\r\ncodling-moth with London purple and Paris green immediately after the\r\nblossoms fall, and again in ten days. I think I have reduced the\r\ncodling-moth. I dig borers out. I pick my apples from a ladder in a\r\nbasket. I sort into three classes--sound, medium, and small and unsound.\r\nI pack in barrels carefully, and haul to shipping point in spring wagon.\r\nI sell in orchard; also wholesale, retail, and peddle; market most of\r\nthem at home; make vinegar of the culls. My best market is home. Never\r\ndry any. I store some for winter in barrels in cellar; am not always\r\nsuccessful; Ben Davis keeps best. I have to repack stored apples before\r\nmarketing, and lose about ten per cent. Do not irrigate. Prices have\r\nbeen from twenty-five cents to one dollar per bushel.

For commercial\r\npurposes he prefers Ben Davis and Limber Twig, and for the family adds\r\nMaiden's Blush. Prefers dark soil with a low southern slope, if not wet.\r\nPrefers two-year-old trees set about thirty feet apart. Cultivates with\r\na disc harrow until four or five years old. Grows corn for five or six\r\nyears. Thinks windbreaks essential; would make them of Osage orange all\r\naround the orchard. Prunes his trees, and thinks it beneficial, and that\r\nit pays. Does not thin apples on the trees; says the wind does that for\r\nhim. Fertilizes his trees while young with stable litter, and would\r\nadvise it on all soils. Pastures his orchard with calves and hogs, and\r\nthinks it advisable, and that with the hogs it pays. His trees are\r\ntroubled with bark-louse and leaf-roller, and his apples with\r\ncodling-moth. He sprays his trees with London purple, and thinks he has\r\nreduced the codling-moth; for borers, and other insects not affected by\r\nspraying, he throws salt over the roots of the trees. Picks his apples\r\nby hand. Wholesales, retails and peddles them. His best markets are in\r\nhis county; has never tried distant markets. Does not dry any. Is\r\nsuccessful in storing apples in bulk in a cave for winter markets, the\r\nLimber Twig and Rawle's Janet keeping best; has never tried artificial\r\ncold storage. Does not irrigate.

Have 2000 apple trees fourteen years old. I grow for\r\nmarket Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Smith's Cider. For family orchard\r\nI prefer Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, Cooper's Early White, Ben Davis,\r\nand Missouri Pippin. I have discarded Gennetting, Winesap, Rambo, Red\r\nAstrachan, and many others that were worthless in this locality. I\r\nprefer second bottom, dark sandy loam, with north and east aspect. I\r\nplant two-year-old trees thirty feet apart, in holes four feet square,\r\ndug one foot too deep, and filled up with surface soil. I cultivate\r\nthoroughly as long as the orchard lives, with stirring plow and disc,\r\nand crop with corn as long as it will even make fodder, or until the\r\ntrees shade the ground too much to raise anything. For small orchards I\r\nwould recommend a windbreak of Osage orange set far enough apart on the\r\nsouth to grow in the shape of trees. For rabbits I use nothing but\r\ncorn-stalks tied around the trees. I prune in moderation to keep the\r\ntrees low; much pruning will kill trees in this locality. I thin apples\r\nsome on the trees, at any time after they are the size of hickory-nuts.\r\nI find the best pollinators are a good apiary of bees. I believe in\r\nusing plenty of stable litter well mixed with potash, but in moderation\r\nnear the trees. Nothing except hogs should be allowed in an orchard.\r\nThey destroy nearly all the insects. I spray for canker-worm as soon as\r\nthey begin to hatch, and believe I reduced the codling-moth fifty per\r\ncent. last spring. For borers I wash the bodies of the trees early in\r\nspring and twice in May with soft soap and lime. For picking I use a\r\nlong-handled device of my own invention, and sort into two classes: No.\r\n1, best and largest; No. 2, medium. One week after they are put in the\r\npacking-house we pack in barrels, with hay or straw between the layers.\r\nWe market our best apples and sell our second and third grades at home,\r\nand make all culls into cider and vinegar. Have tried distant markets,\r\nbut did not generally pay. Never dried any. We store for winter in a\r\nfruit house and cave, in barrels, and are successful. Our best keepers\r\nhave been Missouri Pippin and Winesap. Our loss on winter apples runs\r\nfrom three to five per cent. Prices in the fall, twenty-five to forty\r\ncents; in winter, 75 cents to $1.25 per bushel. For help we use common\r\nlaborers at from seventy-five cents to one dollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWM. N. SMITH, Brownsville, Chautauqua county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-eight years. I have an apple orchard of fifty trees twenty years\r\nold and twelve inches in diameter. For commercial purposes I prefer Ben\r\nDavis, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap, and for family orchard I would add\r\nMaiden's Blush and Bellflower. I prefer bottom land, black, sandy loam,\r\nwith a clay bottom and a north slope. I plant my trees thirty-six feet\r\neach way. I plant my orchard to corn and potatoes, using a disc, and\r\nplant tame grass in a bearing orchard, and cease cropping when they\r\nbegin to bear. Windbreaks are essential. I would make them of Osage\r\norange, and would surround the orchard with a fence of the same. I prune\r\nto keep the limbs from rubbing, and I think it pays. I do not thin the\r\nfruit while on the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings. I do not\r\nfertilize my orchard; am on bottom land, which does not need it, but\r\nthink it would be beneficial on some soils. I pasture my orchard with\r\nhogs, but do not think it advisable; it does not pay. My trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, flathead borer, roundhead\r\nborer, twig-borer, and leaf-roller. I spray with Paris green and London\r\npurple when the worms are at work on the leaves. I dig borers out. I\r\nhand-pick my apples in baskets from ladders, and sort into two\r\nclasses--large and perfect in number one, small and perfect in number\r\ntwo; the balance for cider. I pack in barrels filled full, and mark with\r\nthe grade; then haul to market in a wagon. I make the culls into cider.\r\nCoffeyville is my best market. I dry some and find a ready market for\r\nthem; it pays. I am successful in storing apples in bulk in a cellar,\r\nand find Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin and Winesap keep best. Prices have\r\nbeen about fifty cents per bushel; dried apples, five cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. E. HILDRETH, secretary Altamont Horticultural Society, Altamont,\r\nLabette county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-seven years. I have an\r\napple orchard of 15,000 trees eight years old, five inches in diameter,\r\nand prefer Ben Davis, Jonathan and Missouri Pippin for market; and for\r\nfamily use Early Harvest, Red June, Jonathan, Maiden's Blush, Winesap,\r\nand Missouri Pippin. I prefer gray or red soil, porous subsoil, with an\r\neastern slope. I set first-class, two-year-old, well-branched trees, in\r\nlarge furrows, deeply plowed out, twenty feet north and south, and\r\nthirty-two feet east and west. For six years I grow corn in the orchard,\r\ncultivating well; after that nothing. I plow shallow, and disc or harrow\r\nuntil midsummer as often as the weeds start. I cultivate as long as the\r\ntrees live. To protect from rabbits I use sixteen-inch lath woven with\r\nfour strands of wire. I prune, to allow only three or four main\r\nbranches. I believe in fertilizer, and would use it if I had it. I think\r\npasturing in the orchard advisable, with young cattle or hogs, and that\r\nit pays. Am troubled some with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, and\r\ncodling-moth; for these I spray with London purple, using a tank, with a\r\npump run by a sprocket and chain, from a wagon wheel. I believe I have\r\nreduced the codling-moth by spraying. We pick in a sack over the\r\nshoulder, as used in sowing oats. I sort only into first class and\r\nculls, as emptied by the pickers on canvas-covered tables. I use\r\neleven-peck barrels, marking the name of variety and quality. Sell only\r\nat wholesale, making cider of the culls. Have shipped to distant\r\nmarkets, but it did not pay. Have never dried any, but think I ought to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. S. HACKNEY, Walton, Harvey county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-seven\r\nyears. Have an orchard of 325 apple trees twenty-four years old, eight\r\nto sixteen inches in diameter. For commercial orchard I prefer Ben\r\nDavis, Winesap, Snow, Maiden's Blush, Huntsman's Favorite, and Grimes's\r\nGolden Pippin, and would plant the same for family orchard. Have tried\r\nand discarded Winter Strawberry and Paradise Pippin for shy bearing. I\r\nprefer high land, rich subsoil, with north slope. I prefer two-year-old\r\ngrafts, the more fibrous roots the better. I checked my land to corn and\r\nthen dug out the hill of corn where tree was to stand. I raise my own\r\nroot grafts. I cultivate my young orchard with corn, wheat, and oats,\r\nusing disc and smoothing harrow. I plant a bearing orchard to clover,\r\nand cease cropping when the limbs interfere with work. I think\r\nwindbreaks are essential, and would make them of rapid-growing\r\nforest-trees. To protect the trees from rabbits, I wash them with blood\r\nand liver and tie up. I prune while young to shape and balance the top,\r\nand think it beneficial. I never thin apples. I fertilize with barn-yard\r\nlitter and wood ashes. I pasture my orchard with hogs and young cattle;\r\nthink it advisable, and that it pays.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with tent-caterpillar; my fruit with codling-moth,\r\ncurculio, and gouger. I spray for the above-named insects after the\r\nblossom has fallen and until apples are as large as quail eggs. I think\r\nI have reduced the codling-moth. For the insects not affected by\r\nspraying I wash with soap and strong lye. I spray with London purple,\r\nParis green, and kerosene emulsion. We pick apples by hand and are\r\ncareful not to bruise them. I sort into two classes; the small and\r\ndefective go to the chickens. I generally retail my apples toward\r\nspring; sell second and third grades wherever I can; make cider of\r\nculls. My best markets are home and Newton. Do not dry any for market. I\r\nstore 300 or 400 bushels of apples in a cellar 32x32 feet, cemented\r\nsides and bottom, with plenty of windows and doors for ventilation; am\r\nfairly successful; Ben Davis and Winesap keep best. I have to repack\r\nthem before marketing. I do not irrigate. Prices have been 40 cents to\r\n$1.75 per bushel. I employ ordinary farm hands at $200 per year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nP. C. BROWN, Cherryvale, Montgomery county: I have lived in Kansas\r\neighteen years; have an apple orchard of 600 trees from six to\r\ntwenty-four years old. For commercial orchard I prefer Ben Davis and\r\nJonathan, and for family orchard would add Maiden's Blush, Lowell, and\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin. Have tried and discarded Missouri Pippin,\r\nLawver, and Roxbury Russet. I prefer a first or second bottom, with a\r\nnorthern or western aspect, sandy loam with gravelly subsoil. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old, well-headed trees, set thirty by thirty. I have some set\r\nthirty by fifteen feet, but intend to grub every other one out when\r\nlarge. I plant my orchard to corn or potatoes, cultivating two or four\r\ntimes a year until they begin to bear, using a stirring plow, Acme\r\nharrow, and Planet jr. horse cultivator. Never cease cropping, but\r\npasture with hogs. Sow grass and clover in a bearing orchard. Do not cut\r\nand take crop off more than twice after they begin to bear. Windbreaks\r\nare not essential, but if they were I should make them of any kind of\r\ntrees or hedges, by planting on south and west sides. For rabbits I\r\ninclose the tree with wire screening. I dig the borers out. I prune\r\ntrees while young, until they begin to bear, by cutting out the cross\r\nbranches and watersprouts. This will promote wood growth, if done in\r\nearly spring. It is generally beneficial. I have thinned the fruit\r\nsometimes, but it does not pay. Can't see any difference whether trees\r\nare in blocks of one variety or in mixed plantings. I fertilize my\r\norchard with lime and ashes in limited quantities. It is beneficial only\r\non loose, loamy soil; would not advise its use on heavy clay soils. I\r\npasture my orchard after it comes into full bearing with swine and\r\npoultry. I think it advisable and that it pays, if too many are not put\r\nin.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, root aphis,\r\ntwig-borer, fall web-worm, and leaf-roller. I spray just after the\r\nleaves start and three times afterwards, a week or ten days apart, using\r\nLondon purple and lime water for the foliage and fruit-eating insects;\r\nthink I have reduced the codling-moth materially. I spray early for\r\ncanker-worm, and just after the blossoms drop for codling-moth and\r\ncurculio. I hand-pick my apples from a step-ladder, in a sack hung over\r\nthe shoulder; sort into three classes--first, smooth and not specked;\r\nsecond, rough and specked; third, partly rotten, for vinegar. I sort\r\ninto baskets from a table which has a rim around the edge. I pack my\r\nfirst-grade apples in barrels pressed full, then headed, marked with a\r\nstencil, and hauled to market on a wagon. I wholesale my best apples to\r\nhome buyers, and also fill orders from a distance; sell my second- and\r\nthird-grade apples to home buyers, and make into sweet cider; make\r\nvinegar of culls and feed them to hogs. My best market is at home; have\r\ntried distant markets; did not pay. Do not dry any. Am fairly successful\r\nin storing apples in barrels, boxes and shallow bins in a cellar; find\r\nRawle's Janet, Ben Davis and Jonathan keep best. Weather is too warm in\r\nthe fall in this latitude to keep apples successfully. I have to repack\r\nstored apples two or three times, losing from one-third to three-fourths\r\nof them; it varies with the season and time of picking. I do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have been from twenty-five cents to one dollar per\r\nbushel. I employ the best help there is to be had, at from 75 cents to\r\n$1.25 per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN HART, Sedan, Chautauqua county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-seven\r\nyears, and have an apple orchard of 400 trees, ten years planted. I\r\nprefer for commercial orchard Ben Davis, and for family orchard Early\r\nHarvest, Maiden's Blush, Winesap, Ben Davis, and Arkansas Black. I\r\nprefer sandy bottom land, and plant my trees in furrows. I cultivate my\r\norchard to corn as long as it is possible to grow anything, but plant\r\nnothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are beneficial. I would make\r\nthem of Osage orange or wild goose plums. I prune with a saw, to thin\r\nout the centers and keep off suckers. I think it beneficial. I fertilize\r\nmy orchard with barn-yard litter. I think it beneficial, and would\r\nadvise its use on some lands. I do not pasture my orchard, nor would I\r\nadvise it. I spray with London purple in the spring, and am successful.\r\nI sell my apples in the orchard, and do not dry any for market.\r\nMissouri Pippin keeps better than other stored apples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES McNICOL, Lost Springs, Marion county: Have been in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years. Have an apple orchard of 12,000 trees, set from\r\nthree to ten years. Prefer Missouri Pippins alone for commercial\r\norchard, and Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, Missouri Pippin and Grimes's\r\nGolden Pippin for family orchard. Have discarded White Winter Pearmain\r\nas not hardy. I prefer bottom land, northern slope, with rich surface\r\nsoil and porous subsoil. After plowing out deep furrows, subsoil with a\r\nlister; then select well-rooted, two-year-old trees and plant carefully.\r\nDistance apart is an important matter; if too close, the trees, no\r\nmatter how well cultivated, will suffer for moisture; if too far apart,\r\nthe wind will play havoc with trees and fruit. I would plant close rows\r\nrunning east and west, as each row would help break the wind when the\r\ntrees in the row reach each other. I would plant twenty feet apart in\r\nthe row, and the rows thirty feet apart, and would recommend planting a\r\nrow of cherry, dwarf pear, plum or peach between the apple rows,\r\nprovided they are cut out at the proper time to not allow them to rob\r\nthe orchard of moisture. Cultivate often to a good old age with a disc\r\nand Acme harrow. Grow corn or Kafir-corn for five or six years, leaving\r\na good space next the trees, not for weeds, but to be well cultivated. A\r\nsilly policy is to cultivate the corn that costs less than five cents\r\nper row for seed four times, and leave the tree row that costs two\r\ndollars or more uncultivated. Do not use a stirring plow; it hills up\r\naround the trees too much. If you list your corn, go east and west one\r\nyear, north and south the next year. Keep the ground well cultivated;\r\ngrow nothing after five or six years, not even weeds or clover.\r\nCultivate at right angles and diagonal. Whenever you are blessed with a\r\ngood rain in summer don't wait until the weeds start, but cultivate as\r\nsoon as the ground will bear it. Keep a dust mulch on by cultivation;\r\nfew know the great value of a dust mulch. For a family orchard a\r\nfive-tooth cultivator near the trees, and a two-horse cultivator for the\r\nmiddles, will do. Use the harrow often. Six days' work at the proper\r\ntime will keep a five-acre orchard in good shape through the season.\r\nSome say this is not a fruit country. It is not and never will be to the\r\none who has no time to cultivate; but to the careful cultivator there is\r\ngreat reward, for the very same reason. I believe it essential to have\r\nwindbreaks, and advise planting three or more rows of honey-locust and\r\nRussian mulberry for windbreaks, on the south and west sides. For\r\nrabbits I use wooden tree wraps, also traps, guns, and dogs. I prune a\r\nlittle, to keep the top balanced. I use no fertilizers, and would never\r\nallow stock pastured in orchard. Am troubled with root aphis,\r\nleaf-crumpler, and codling-moth. I practice spraying with blue vitriol\r\nfor codling-moth. I prevent borers by keeping the ground well\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMIKE GAMER, Strong City, Chase county: Have lived in Kansas since\r\nFebruary 14, 1877.

For commercial\r\norchard I prefer Ben Davis, Willow Twig, Missouri Pippin, Winesap, and\r\nRomanite; for family orchard, Maiden's Blush, Early Harvest, Yellow\r\nTransparent, and Baldwin. I have tried and discarded Sweet Gennetting,\r\nbecause of rot, and when ripe it is too small for market; Caswinculet,\r\nbecause it sun-scalds and dries up, and Early White will not stand the\r\nclimate. I prefer bottom land, with sandy soil. I prefer two-year-old\r\ntrees, with low top, without forks, set four inches above the graft, at\r\nan angle of thirty degrees south. Have grown some seedlings with good\r\nsuccess. I cultivate my orchard with potatoes and tobacco, using a plow\r\nand cultivator, until four years old; I plant nothing in a bearing\r\norchard, and cease cropping when they commence to bear. Windbreaks are\r\nessential here, and I would make them of Osage orange and forest-trees;\r\nif Osage orange is used, plant it twenty feet from the orchard, or it\r\nwill injure the fruit-trees. I wrap my trees with corn-stalks or rags to\r\nprotect from rabbits, and wash the trees with lye water for borers; I\r\nalso dig them out. I have pruned with clippers, and found it injurious\r\nto the trees; I only cut out watersprouts. I never thin my apples; they\r\nthin themselves. My trees are in mixed plantings and bear well.\r\n\r\nI fertilize my orchard with barn-yard litter; I also use fertilizer from\r\nthe chicken yard, and would advise its use on all soils. I never pasture\r\nmy orchard; it injures the trees, and does not pay. My trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, flathead borer, and\r\nleaf-roller. Curculio trouble my apples. I do not spray, but my\r\nneighbors do, and are not successful. I pick my apples by hand into\r\nhalf-bushel baskets, and put them in a wagon, with hay in the bottom. I\r\nsort into three or four classes, putting the red, yellow and green in\r\nseparate piles. I pack my apples in sacks, and haul to market in a\r\nwagon. I often sell in the orchard; retail my best at stores, peddle the\r\nsecond and third grades, and make cider for vinegar of the culls. My\r\nbest markets are Elmdale, Chase county, and Marion, Marion county; have\r\nnever tried distant markets. We dry a few apples; use a parer, corer,\r\nand slicer; it is satisfactory; then pack them in flour sacks; but it\r\ndoes not pay. I store some in boxes and barrels in a cave; am\r\nsuccessful; those that keep best are Romanite and Red Winter Pearmain.\r\nNever have tried artificial cold storage. We have to repack stored\r\napples before sending to market; lose about five per cent. Prices have\r\nbeen from fifty cents to one dollar per bushel, and dried apples five\r\ncents per pound.

BAILEY, Uniontown, Bourbon county: I have lived in Kansas fifteen\r\nyears, and have an orchard of 150 apple trees thirty years old. I prefer\r\nCanada Pippin [Downing calls this White Pippin], Ben Davis, Rome Beauty,\r\nJonathan, Missouri Pippin, and Maiden's Blush, for all purposes. I\r\nprefer hillside land, with a northeastern slope. I plant apple trees\r\nthirty feet apart each way. I cultivate in potatoes, corn, or any hoed\r\ncrop, using a hoe and cultivator. I sow a bearing orchard to clover, and\r\ncease cropping at ten or twelve years. Windbreaks are essential, and I\r\nwould make them of Osage orange planted thirty feet from the trees. I\r\nprune a little every year, to get rid of dead limbs, and also thin out\r\nthe center of trees, to improve the fruit. I use a saw and knife. My\r\ntrees are in block. It is beneficial to mulch with old hay or straw in\r\ndrought. I pasture my orchard with small calves, but would not advise\r\nit, as it does not pay. I sprayed with a pump, using London purple, but\r\nit did little good. I cut borers out, and then pour coal-oil in the\r\nholes. I hand-pick my apples in a sack, using a ladder. I sort into two\r\nclasses--good and second best. If for home use, I put them in rail pens\r\nfor about three weeks; then sort out the good ones and make cider of the\r\nculls. I pack in three-bushel barrels, and ship to Kansas City. I sell\r\nmy best apples to shippers. I dry and make cider of the second- and\r\nthird-class apples, and feed the culls to the hogs and cows. I store\r\nsome for home use, and would store more if I had cold storage. We have\r\nto repack stored apples before selling, and lose about one-half of them.\r\nI have sold Canada Pippins from fifty cents to two dollars per bushel.

WALTERS, Emporia, Lyon county: I have been in Kansas nearly\r\ntwenty-one years. I have 700 apple trees; 200 thirty years old, 100\r\neleven years old, and 400 seven years old. Market varieties, Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, and Jonathan; and for family have added Red\r\nAstrachan, Red June, Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, and Rambo. I prefer\r\nbottom land if not too low; I have apples when they dry up on the hill.\r\nPrefer a rich, dark loam, with a slightly porous subsoil, and northeast\r\nslope. Use two-year-old thrifty trees, with well-balanced head. Fall\r\nplow deeply, throw two or three furrows each way, leaving a deep dead\r\nfurrow, cross lightly with one furrow, and plant at the crossings. I\r\ngrow corn, sweet and Irish potatoes for eight or ten years, then seed to\r\nclover. I cultivate with a one-horse plow, using a hoe around trees. In\r\nmy oldest orchard I grow nothing, but use the disc freely. I believe\r\nwindbreaks necessary on upland, but not in our bottom. Use corn-stalks\r\ntied around the tree for rabbits. I prevent borers by keeping the trees\r\nthrifty. I prune with knife and saw only to remove dead limbs and keep\r\nothers from rubbing together, and I think it pays. I think thinning\r\nwould pay, with cheap labor. Have used coarse stable litter in my\r\norchard; think it has paid in larger and better-colored fruit; would\r\nadvise its use for bearing trees. I would pasture my orchard with\r\ncalves, hogs, and sheep, if I had them; I believe if judiciously done it\r\nwould pay. I spray before the buds open, after the bloom drops, and ten\r\ndays later, with London purple and lime, for canker-worm and\r\ncodling-moth; have kept the canker-worm in check, but have not prevented\r\nmy apples from getting wormy and falling. I hand-pick in sacks and\r\nbaskets; pack in tight, eleven-peck barrels; but sell most of my apples\r\nin the orchard to teamsters from the West. I sell culls to the cider\r\nand canning factories. My best market is in the orchard. Never shipped\r\nbut once; not satisfactory. I store some in tight barrels in the cellar,\r\nand find Winesaps keep the best. We lose from ten to twenty-five per\r\ncent. of them; some winters they keep better than others. Never dried\r\nany, and have not irrigated. Prices from thirty to fifty cents per\r\nbushel at picking time. I use men and boys at from fifty cents to one\r\ndollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. L. KENDRICK, Waverly, Coffey county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-five years. Have an apple orchard of 375 trees, eighteen years\r\nplanted. For commercial purposes I prefer Ben Davis, Jonathan, Missouri\r\nPippin, and Winesap; for family orchard, Early Harvest, Summer Queen,\r\nand Sherwood's Favorite [Chenango]. Have tried and discarded Bellflower\r\nand Rawle's Janet; they are a failure. I prefer hilltop, with a deep\r\nclay soil, slightly sandy, and a north or northeast slope. I prefer\r\ntwo-year-old trees, with smooth, heavy bodies, and a low top, set in\r\nholes forty feet apart, with a little loose dirt thrown in the bottom,\r\nthe trees leaning a little to the southwest. I cultivate my orchard to\r\nsweet corn and castor-beans, using a disc run deep, excepting close to\r\ntrees; I cease cropping after five years, and sow a bearing orchard to\r\nclover. Windbreaks are essential, and I would make them of maple,\r\nRussian mulberry, or Osage orange, set in rows close together, and cut\r\ntop off maples at four feet. I use building paper as a protection\r\nagainst rabbits, and for borers I whitewash the trees; then remove about\r\nthree inches of earth from the trees and pour some around the roots. I\r\nprune with a saw and shears, to admit more air and sun; I think it\r\nbeneficial, and that it pays. I never thin my fruit on the trees. My\r\ntrees are in mixed plantings, and I find them and Mrs. Garrison's and\r\nseveral others' are thus more fruitful; the varieties used are Ben\r\nDavis, Jonathan, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and Sherwood's Favorite,\r\nplanted in alternate rows east and west. I never fertilize my orchard; I\r\nthink clover left in an orchard for two years and then plowed or cut in\r\nwith a disc is the best fertilizer for an orchard after it begins to\r\nbear. I never pasture my orchard; do not think it advisable.\r\n\r\nMy trees are troubled with bag-worm, roundhead borer, bark-louse, and\r\nfall web-worm. My apples are troubled with curculio. I spray with London\r\npurple and lime, with a pump, just after the fruit is formed, for\r\nweb-worm and curculio. I think I have reduced the codling-moth by\r\nspraying. I get after insects not affected by spraying with a knife. I\r\ngather apples by hand in a sack, and sort into three classes: the large\r\nand smooth, second size, and culls. I sort from the piles after picking;\r\nthen sell or bury them. I prefer two-and-one-half-bushel barrels, with\r\nstraw in the bottom and around the sides, marked with a tin tag, and\r\nhauled to market in a heavy spring wagon. I sell in the orchard,\r\nwholesale, retail, and peddle; I sell my best apples to shippers, peddle\r\nthe second and third grades, and make cider of the culls. My best market\r\nis Ottawa; have never tried a distant market. I store apples in bulk or\r\nbin, in a fruit house built on a well-drained place; the house is made\r\nof flax straw, posts, and wire or boards to hold the straw in place; the\r\nwalls are three and one-half feet thick, four and one-half feet high,\r\nand the roof two and one-half feet, with ventilator in the center. The\r\ndoor is in the east end. I use two doors, one on the inside, and one on\r\nthe outside, filling the space between with flax straw. Am successful in\r\nkeeping apples, and find those that keep best are Jonathan, Winesap,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Smith's Cider. Winter apples have been forty-five\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW. J. ALBRIGHT, Julia, Kingman county: Have lived in Kansas eighteen\r\nyears; have an apple orchard of 500 trees, six to seventeen years old,\r\nfour to ten inches in diameter, I prefer bottom land for an orchard. I\r\ncultivate my orchard by subsoiling and shallow cultivation, using a disc\r\nand Acme harrow; I grow nothing in a bearing orchard, not even weeds.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of Osage orange or Russian\r\nmulberries. Am not troubled with rabbits or borers. I prune some; it\r\nmakes better trees. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with cow-stable litter, but do not think it\r\nbeneficial. I do not pasture my orchard. My apples are troubled with\r\ncodling-moth. I sprayed five years with Paris green and London purple,\r\nand was not successful. I gather my fruit off the ground. My best market\r\nis at home. We dry apples for home use, and do not store any. I irrigate\r\nwith a windmill and earth reservoir; it makes big trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nL. J. HAINES, Galena, Cherokee county: Has been in Kansas nineteen\r\nyears. Has an orchard of 2500 trees, fourteen years planted, averaging\r\neighteen inches in diameter, planted for commercial purposes, and\r\ncomprising Willow Twig, Ben Davis, and Winesap, which varieties he would\r\nalso recommend for family orchard. Has tried and discarded Snow and\r\nMissouri Pippin, as they would not bear fruit; cannot tell why. Prefers\r\nalluvial soil, with clay subsoil susceptible of good drainage, south\r\nslope preferred. Cultivates always with plow, leaving a deep center\r\nfurrow. Tries to eradicate all growth between the trees in a bearing\r\norchard. Believes windbreaks are essential; uses maple. Prunes, to\r\nstimulate trunk and fruit growth. Fertilizes with wood ashes, and says\r\nthey should be used on all soils that lack potash. Pastures his orchard\r\nin spring with calves and hogs, and believes it pays. Sprays April 1,\r\nApril 30, and June 1, with London purple, copperas, Paris green, and\r\nBordeaux mixture. Not fully successful, but believes he reduces the\r\ncodling-moth. For borers he lixiviates the ground. This, he claims,\r\nkills by contact under the ground. Plow in fall in time to let the rains\r\nsettle in, and too late to keep it from freezing; freeze them out. Sorts\r\ninto three classes: Middling [fair], bad, and worse. Hand packed in\r\nbarrels, stem down, best on top, and marked \"First class.\" He sells at\r\nwholesale, sometimes in orchard. Feeds culls to stock. Has found Kansas\r\nCity, Omaha and Denver to be the best markets. Dries apples on Fay\r\ndrier, made in Cincinnati, for home use only, and not satisfactory.\r\nStores apples for winter in bulk in cave, and finds Ben Davis the best\r\nkeeper. For help he uses boys at fifty cents per day, and men at one\r\ndollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. J. SALTZMAN, Burrton, Harvey county: I have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-one years. Have an apple orchard of 500 trees from one to twelve\r\ninches in diameter. For commercial orchard I would prefer Early Harvest,\r\nMaiden's Blush, Ben Davis, Cooper's Early White, and Jonathan; and for\r\nfamily orchard Early Harvest, Lawver, Jonathan, and Winesap. Have tried\r\nand discarded Willow Twig and Large Romanite on account of blight, and\r\nthe fruit rots and specks. I prefer hilltop, with sandy loam and clay\r\nsubsoil, and a north or northwest aspect. Prefer two-year-old trees,\r\nwith good, thrifty roots, planted thirty feet apart each way. I\r\ncultivate my orchard to corn, potatoes, Kafir-corn and cane for five or\r\nsix years, with plow and cultivator, and cease cropping when the orchard\r\nbegins to bear. I plant bearing orchard to rye, oats, and artichokes,\r\nand then turn in hogs. Windbreaks are essential; would makes them of\r\nevergreens or Russian mulberries, planted four feet apart. I prune with\r\na saw, pruning-hook, knife, and sometimes an ax, to give proper shape to\r\nthe tree, and to let in air and light; I think it pays. I do not thin\r\nthe fruit on the trees, but think it should be done. I fertilize my\r\norchard with barn-yard litter, and think it beneficial; I would advise\r\nits use on all soils. I pasture my orchard after five or six years with\r\nhogs, and think it advisable and that it pays. My trees are troubled\r\nwith root aphis, but not bad, and my apples with codling-moth. I do not\r\nspray. I hand-pick my apples, in baskets, or in a sack over the\r\nshoulder, and put them in barrels, boxes, or wagon. I sort into two\r\nclasses: first, sound, for market or home use; second, for vinegar. I\r\nsort them as I pick, and drop the vinegar ones on the ground, and gather\r\nafterwards. I pack my apples in bushel boxes (that is the best way)\r\nwhile picking. I sell apples in the orchard; also wholesale, retail, and\r\npeddle. I make second- and third-grade apples into vinegar, or feed them\r\nto hogs. My best market is at home. Have tried distant markets, and\r\nfound it sometimes paid. I do not dry any, and am successful at storing\r\napples in bulk in a cellar; sometimes I bury them; I find Winesap,\r\nLimber Twig and Little Romanite keep best. We have to repack stored\r\napples before marketing, losing from ten to fifteen per cent. of them. I\r\ndo not irrigate, but think it would pay. Prices have been from forty\r\ncents to one dollar per bushel; dried apples from five to six cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. B. SAXE, Fort Scott, Bourbon county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-nine\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 800 trees from fifteen to twenty-seven\r\nyears old. For commercial orchard I prefer Ben Davis and Willow Twig,\r\nand for family orchard would add Winesap and Jonathan. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Baldwin, Yellow Bellflower, Maiden's Blush, Early Harvest,\r\nSweet Bough, Bailey's Sweet, Roxberry Russet, Fall Strawberry, King of\r\nTompkins County, and several Russian varieties; all are worthless. I\r\nprefer hilly land, with loam soil and clay subsoil, northeast slope. I\r\nprefer one- or two-year-old medium-sized trees, set twenty to thirty\r\nfeet apart. Plant my orchard to corn, raspberries, and blackberries,\r\nusing a plow and cultivator--a one-horse cultivator between the rows,\r\nfor five or six years; cease cropping when the trees begin to bear.\r\nWindbreaks are not essential. I poison the rabbits, and am not bothered\r\nwith borers. Prune a little with a pruning knife to keep the head open;\r\nthink it pays, and is beneficial. Have never thinned apples while on the\r\ntrees. I do not fertilize; our soil is rich enough; ashes or potash\r\nmight be beneficial. I think hogs beneficial in an orchard. My trees are\r\ntroubled with root aphis, and my apples with codling-moth and curculio.\r\nPick apples by hand from a ladder into a bag. Sort into two classes,\r\nperfect and imperfect, from piles on the grass or ground. Pack my apples\r\nin barrels by hand, mark with my name, and haul to market in a spring\r\nwagon. Generally sell apples in the orchard, also wholesale; peddle the\r\nsecond and third grades, and make culls into cider for vinegar. Never\r\ndry any. I stored some in boxes in the cellar last fall, also buried\r\nsome in the ground, and was successful. Found Limber Twig and Rawle's\r\nJanet kept best. We had to repack stored apples before marketing; lost\r\nabout one-half of those in the cellar, but very few of those buried in\r\nthe ground. Do not irrigate. Prices were about forty cents per bushel at\r\nwholesale in the fall on the trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nS. F. C. GARRISON, El Dorado, Butler county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-seven years; have an apple orchard of 1000 trees, twenty to\r\ntwenty-five years old, ten to twelve inches in diameter. I prefer for\r\ncommercial purposes Ben Davis, Winesap, King of Tompkins County, and\r\nRawle's Janet; and for family orchard Maiden's Blush, Milam, Jonathan,\r\nand Sweet Bough. Have tried and discarded Keswick Codlin, Willow Twig\r\nand Dominie on account of blight. I prefer second bottom, reddish soil,\r\nwith liver-red subsoil, and a north slope. I prefer two-year-old,\r\nshort-trunk, smooth and round trees. In planting, plow both ways with a\r\ncoulter and subsoiler, then dig out. I cultivate my orchard to corn for\r\nthree or four years, using a plow; I cease cropping after eight years,\r\nand plant nothing in a bearing orchard. I use sulphur mixed with axle\r\ngrease to protect against rabbits. For borers I use fish oil spurted in\r\nwith sewing-machine oiler. I prune the under limbs to prevent hanging on\r\nthe ground. It does not pay, and is not very beneficial. I thin Rawle's\r\nJanet apples when the smallest ones are as large as marbles. My trees\r\nare in mixed plantings. I fertilize with stable litter, and think it\r\nbeneficial; but would not advise its use on all soils. Never pasture my\r\norchard. My trees are troubled with canker-worm, root aphis, twig-borer,\r\nleaf-roller, and bark-louse, and my apples with curculio. I spray with\r\nLondon purple and strychnine when the leaves are small; think I have\r\nreduced the codling-moth. I pick my apples (from step-ladders where\r\nhigh) into baskets. Sort into three classes: cider, specked, and sound.\r\nWe leave them in piles until they sweat, then dry and sort. I prefer\r\ntwo-and-one-half bushel barrels, packed with a nice layer on the bottom\r\n(this will be top when opened), then mark with the name of fruit, and\r\nhaul to market by rail or wagon. I sell in orchard, wholesale, retail,\r\nand peddle, and make cider of the culls. My best markets are Wichita,\r\nPueblo, Leadville, the Strip, and Eldorado. Have tried distant markets,\r\nbut it does not pay.\r\n\r\nI never dry any for market. I store some apples for winter market in\r\nbulk; am not very successful; find Winesap keeps the best. Have to\r\nrepack stored apples before marketing; lose about ten per cent. I do not\r\nirrigate. Prices have been from twenty-five cents to one dollar per\r\nbushel; dried apples, four and one-half cents per pound. I employ young\r\nmen, at from seventy-five cents to one dollar per day. I have sprayed\r\ncarefully for three years, and am glad to report no worms this year\r\n[1898]. Winesap not full--too full and dry last year, Maiden's Blush\r\nfull, Rawle's Janet very full, Sweet Bough full, Limber Twig full, Milam\r\nfull, Ben Davis fair, Northern Spy fair, Little Romanite light, Jonathan\r\nlight, Willow Twig and King (of Tompkins county) full, Talman Sweet\r\nfull, and Pound Sweet full.\r\n\r\nTrees must not be trimmed up too high, as is too much the practice. A\r\nlow, broad top will hold the least sprinkle of rain longer, and the wind\r\nwill not have much chance to dry the earth under the trees. There are\r\nmillions of hair roots just at the surface, in the compost, or loose\r\nearth, to immediately absorb the moisture if wind and sun are kept off.\r\nThe buds set better when the trunks are short, and kept as cool as\r\npossible, so that the sap can run freely to the terminal buds, and also\r\nmake buds, when, if high and dry, no bud formation can occur. Trees\r\nshould be short in trunk, broad top, and limbs nearly to the ground. No\r\nhogs nor calves should be allowed in the orchard, but all the chickens\r\npossible. Cut off all dead branches, and fill up vacancies. Trees should\r\nbe two or three years old when set. When setting make a good large hole,\r\nand in the center make a hill or cone of earth. Then spread the roots\r\nout in their natural position, and after this fill in some earth and\r\npress lightly. Set two or three inches deeper than they grew in the\r\nnursery, trim close, and leave no acute forks. Compel the limbs to start\r\nat obtuse or right angles from the trunk; if they bend over to the\r\nnorth, anchor with string and stake. The art and science of horticulture\r\nare little studied in Kansas. It takes good judgment and a scientific\r\nturn of mind to be successful in orcharding. Chemistry, botany and\r\nphysiology are especially necessary to make it a delightful work in\r\nlife. We must run back to the original, which was no doubt far beyond\r\nanything we as yet have, or we could not improve at all. The beauty ran\r\ndown as man did, and it will be a long time before perfection is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD. M. ADAMS, Rome, Sumner county: I have lived in Kansas fourteen years;\r\nhave an apple orchard of 140 trees from eight to twelve years old. For\r\nmarket I prefer Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap. I prefer bottom\r\nland for an orchard. I prefer three-year-old trees set fifteen by thirty\r\nfeet; mine are planted thirty by thirty. I plant my orchard to corn for\r\nfour years, using a cultivator and harrow, and cease cropping after four\r\nor five years. I plant nothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential here. For rabbits I use a gun and traps, and for borers I wash\r\nwith soap-suds. I should thin my apples if there was a heavy crop. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with stable litter, and think it beneficial. I do\r\nnot pasture my orchard; it is not advisable. My trees are troubled with\r\nborers. I do not spray.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PRICE, El Dorado, Butler county: Have lived in Kansas\r\nthirty-five years; have 1200 apple trees, planted twelve to eighteen\r\nyears, running from eight to twelve inches in diameter. My market\r\nvarieties are Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Ben Davis, Large Romanite, and\r\nJonathan; for family I have added Early Harvest, Red June, Red\r\nAstrachan, and Maiden's Blush. I have discarded Rawle's Janet, as they\r\ngrow in clusters and rot on the trees. My location is on hilltop, with a\r\nloose clay soil, and a north aspect. I plant two-year-old upright trees,\r\nwith good roots, in deep furrows thrown out each way, and subsoiled. I\r\ncultivate same as corn, and grow corn as a crop, for small grains and\r\nmillet breed insects. In the bearing orchard I grow nothing. I cultivate\r\nwith the disc harrow, cultivator, and plow, until the trees cover the\r\nground, from twelve to fifteen years from planting. I wash the trees\r\nthree times a year with a solution of soft-soap suds and crude carbolic\r\nacid. I believe windbreaks are essential, and would make them of rapid,\r\ndense-growing trees; I use Russian mulberry, planted in three rows,\r\ntwelve feet apart, mismatched. For rabbits I rub the trees with sulphur\r\nand grease. If trees are washed with carbolic acid and soap-suds, no\r\nborer will ever attack them. I trim very slightly to keep down\r\nwatersprouts; to trim as they do in the East does not pay here. I do not\r\nthin, but believe fruit would sometimes be larger and better for it. I\r\nbelieve in fertilizing, and prefer cow-yard litter, sheep litter, and\r\nhay; on rich bottom land I would use hay mulching. Mulching should be\r\nremoved from around the trees for hoeing, and then replaced. I never\r\npasture an orchard.\r\n\r\nAm troubled some with canker-worm, twig-borer, and codling-moth. I spray\r\nthree or four times in a season, from eight to ten days apart, according\r\nto the weather, beginning as soon as the blossoms appear, with a large\r\nforce-pump, and a rod with double nozzle, for canker-worm, web-worm, and\r\ncodling-moth. I have lessened the codling-moth by using copper sulphate\r\nsolution very early [?]. For borers I use London purple, copper\r\nsulphate, Bordeaux, and Paris green [?]. We pick by hand, and sort into\r\ntwo classes: First, the finest fruit; third, the culls, and second,\r\nbetweens. Sell some in the orchard, from a bushel to wagon-loads. Sell\r\nmy best apples on orders from merchants and citizens. The second grade\r\nsame as the first, if desired. The culls I make into vinegar, which I\r\nsell in the home market. Our best market is at home. I tried shipping,\r\nbut transportation charges were too high; have not tried drying. I store\r\nfor winter outdoors, covered with hay and dirt, so as not to freeze. The\r\nRomanite keeps best. I make my piles of twenty bushels, and lose perhaps\r\none-twentieth. Do not irrigate. Prices of late: First class, fifty\r\ncents; second class, thirty-five cents per bushel. I use young men and\r\nboys at from fifty cents to one dollar per day and board. I have one of\r\nthe best small orchards in the state. Have been successful in planting\r\nand growing trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. E.

For market I prefer Missouri Pippin and Ben\r\nDavis, and for family orchard would add Winesap, Early June, and\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin. I prefer bottom land with a sandy loam soil and\r\nporous subsoil. I prefer two-year-old trees set thirty feet apart each\r\nway. I cultivate my orchard to corn or potatoes for several years, using\r\na common cultivator; cease cropping when they begin to bear, and sow to\r\norchard-grass. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of\r\nforest-trees. I prune to thin the branches; think it beneficial. Do not\r\nthin the fruit while on the trees. My trees are in mixed plantings. I do\r\nnot fertilize my orchard. I do not pasture my orchard. Codling-moth\r\ntroubles my apples; have not sprayed. Pick my apples by hand; sort into\r\ntwo classes--marketable and cider. I sell some apples while in the\r\norchard at retail. Sell my best apples in home market, and make cider of\r\nculls. Never tried distant markets. Do not dry any. Don't store any. Do\r\nnot irrigate.

Grow only Ben Davis, Winesap, and Missouri Pippin.\r\nHave discarded Willow Twig on account of blight. My location is in the\r\nbottom, with rich loam and sandy subsoil. I have planted in rows\r\nthirty-two feet distant; cultivate in corn for four years after\r\nplanting, and use the disc harrow as much as possible. In a bearing\r\norchard I would put clover. Believe windbreaks are essential, made of\r\nany kind of forest-trees, planted thickly, in two or three rows around\r\nthe orchard, and cultivated while small. Protect from rabbits with a dog\r\nand gun, and also by wrapping the trees. Prune very little; simply keep\r\ndown sprouts and remove crossed limbs. Have never thinned on the tree,\r\nand believe barn-yard litter useful as a fertilizer. I pasture with a\r\nfew calves, but think it does not pay. Am troubled with some insect, and\r\nspray moderately in May with London purple, for web-worm and\r\nleaf-crumpler. Pick from the wagon, driving under the trees. Sell at\r\nboth wholesale and retail, and my best market is the commercial buyer.\r\nFeed my culls mostly to the pigs. Never have dried any, nor stored any\r\nfor winter. Have a pipe running from my water-tank, by which means have\r\nwatered a few trees for a number of years, and these trees are very\r\nlarge and yield very fine fruit. If I were to start again, instead of\r\nplanting 500 apple trees I would plant sixty, and dig a well and put a\r\nwindmill in the midst of them; and I am confident I would get more\r\nsatisfactory returns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. A. MULLINEAUX, Cherryvale, Montgomery county: I have been in Kansas\r\ntwenty-nine years. Have 350 apple trees of various ages and sizes,\r\nmainly Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin. Have tried and discarded the\r\nRomanite as too small. I prefer bottom or second-bottom land, red soil,\r\nwith sandy subsoil, and a south slope. I plant two-year-old trees in the\r\nspring, 32x32 feet; cultivate for four years, growing oats as a crop;\r\nalso grow oats in a bearing orchard. Believe windbreaks or an\r\nOsage-orange hedge are beneficial. I tie corn-stalks around my trees to\r\nkeep off the rabbits. I never prune at all. Do not thin fruit on the\r\ntrees. I fertilize with stable litter while trees are young. Believe it\r\npays to pasture orchards with hogs, as they destroy worms. I am troubled\r\nsome with borers, web-worms, and codling-moth, but have never practiced\r\nspraying. I pick by hand, and sort into first and second classes, and\r\npack in bushel boxes, selling at wholesale; haul to market on a rack;\r\nmake my culls into cider. My best market is Cherryvale. Never have\r\ndried any. Do not irrigate. I store for winter in bulk in the cellar,\r\nand am successful in keeping Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis.

RECORD, Thayer, Neosho county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-one\r\nyears; have 400 apple trees eight years old. My land is eastern slope,\r\nclay subsoil; I plant 20x28, first subsoiling the row. Cultivate to corn\r\nand potatoes with a plow, common cultivator, and five-tooth cultivator,\r\nuntil eight years old; then sow to clover. I believe a windbreak is\r\nessential, and like Russian mulberry planted on the south and west. To\r\nprotect from rabbits and borers I use a wash made of soap, lime, and\r\ncrude coal-oil. I prune with the shears to balance the top properly, and\r\nthink it pays. I think varieties that grow in clusters like Rawle's\r\nJanet should be thinned to a single specimen. I use stable litter, as my\r\nland is a light, sandy loam and needs it. I pasture my orchard with\r\nhogs, but not too many; if they run short of feed they will sometimes\r\nbark the trees. I am troubled some with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar,\r\nleaf-roller, and codling-moth. I spray as soon as the bloom is off and\r\ntwice afterwards with lime and crude oil, to kill the leaf eaters and\r\nfungus, and have probably reduced the codling-moth. I look for borers in\r\nthe fall and dig them out with a knife. My orchard is yet too young to\r\ndescribe picking, sorting, etc. I intend to build a pond and try wetting\r\nthe ground when the trees need it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAS.

I prefer hilltop, with sandy\r\nsoil, and a red, sandy subsoil, with western slope. I plant\r\ntwo-year-old, low, stocky trees, two rods apart each way. I cultivate\r\nwith plow and cultivator. I whitewash with lime and blood to keep the\r\nrabbits off, and lime to keep off borers and other insects. I prune,\r\ntaking off only surplus limbs, and think it beneficial. I never thin\r\napples. I fertilize to improve the tree; I think it advisable. Am\r\ntroubled with canker-worm, leaf-crumplers, and codling-moth. I spray\r\nwhen the leaves are just out with London purple for canker-worm, and\r\nthink I have reduced the codling-moth. For insects that are not affected\r\nby spraying, I wash the trees with lime during the fall, and in the\r\nspring with strong soap suds. I pick my apples by hand, and sort into\r\ntwo classes--best for eating, second for cider. For packing I prefer\r\nboxes made of slats [lath?], two feet wide by four feet long, and one\r\nfoot deep. I sell some in the orchard, make cider of the culls, and\r\nstore some in boxes, and am successful. I find the Missouri Pippin and\r\nWinesap keep best.

I would recommend for all purposes Ben Davis, Winesap,\r\nand Missouri Pippin. Tried Northern Spy, but it did not do well. My\r\nlocation is on hilltop, north slope, with a black loam soil and clay\r\nsubsoil. I plant two-year-old thrifty trees with a spade, in large, deep\r\nholes. Would cultivate as long as they live, with a plow, and grow no\r\ncrop among the trees. I think a windbreak of several rows of Osage\r\norange on the south side is a necessity. For borers and rabbits wash\r\nwith whale-oil soap, digging out any borers that may be in with a knife.\r\nI prune with a knife, saw, and ax, and believe it pays. I use stable\r\nlitter in my orchard. Tried pasturing my orchard once with hogs, but do\r\nnot think it advisable. Have some borers, tent-caterpillars, and\r\ncodling-moth, but have never sprayed any. Pick in baskets, buckets, and\r\nsacks, and sort into two classes--first, to sell or put away; second,\r\nculls. Prefer large boxes, with the fruit laid in carefully, each kind\r\nby itself. I wholesale as many as possible, sell some in the orchard,\r\nand make cider of culls. My best market is at home. Have never tried\r\ndrying. Keep them successfully over winter in bulk in the cellar for\r\nfamily use; Winesap keeps best.

BROWN, Waverly, Coffey county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-six\r\nyears. Have 1100 apple trees from three to twenty-five years old. My\r\nmarket varieties are Winesap and Missouri Pippin; for family orchard I\r\nadd Yellow Transparent and Grimes's Golden Pippin. My location is\r\nhilltop, with a northern slope. I plant two-year-old trees by running a\r\nfurrow with a plow and opening holes with a shovel. I cultivate with a\r\nplow and cultivator from ten to twelve years, growing corn for ten\r\nyears; after that, nothing. I believe windbreaks are essential, and\r\nwould make them of Osage orange or maples, on the east, north, and\r\nnorthwest. For rabbits I wrap the trees; for borers I wash with soft\r\nsoap. I prune to make the apples larger. I use stable litter between the\r\nrows. I do not think it advisable to pasture the orchard. I do not\r\nspray, and am troubled with canker-worm, flat-headed borer, and\r\ncurculio. We hand-pick into sacks, and sort into four grades--No. 1, No.\r\n2, No. 3, and culls. I peddle my best apples; make culls into cider. My\r\nbest market is Waverly; never tried distant markets. I have dried apples\r\non the Zimmerman drier with satisfaction. I box the dried product and\r\nfind a ready market for it, and think it pays. I do not store any\r\napples. The prevailing price for apples is fifty cents per bushel, and\r\nfor dried apples twelve cents per pound. I use men for help, and pay one\r\ndollar per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDICK MAY, Elk, Chase county: Have lived in Kansas since 1860. Have a\r\nfamily apple orchard of sixty trees eighteen years old. I prefer Ben\r\nDavis and Winesap, on bottom land with a second slope. I cultivate my\r\norchard fourteen years, using a cultivator, and plant corn in a young\r\norchard and orchard-grass in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; I would make them of timber by planting in groves. For\r\nrabbits I wrap the trees; and use soap-suds for borers. I prune with a\r\npruning-knife, and think it pays. I do not thin the fruit while on the\r\ntrees. I would advise the use of fertilizers on all soils. I do not\r\npasture my orchard; do not think it advisable; it does not pay. My trees\r\nare troubled with roundhead borer, and tent-caterpillar. I do not spray.\r\nI pick by hand and sort into two classes. I haul to market in a wagon\r\nand wholesale them. I have put apples in cold storage and find Winesap\r\nand Missouri Pippin keep best and satisfactorily. I have to repack\r\nstored apples before marketing. I do not irrigate. Prices have been from\r\nfifty cents to one dollar per bushel, and dried apples six cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE. O. BEAVERS, Ottumwa, Lyon county: Have been in Kansas twenty-three\r\nyears. Have 2000 apple trees, from one to twenty-three years planted.\r\nPrefer for market Winesap, Mammoth Black Twig, Gano, Ben Davis, and\r\nMissouri Pippin; and for family use Winesap, Mammoth Black Twig, Gano,\r\nBen Davis, Jonathan, and Early Harvest. Have tried and discarded Lawver,\r\nbecause they do not hang on until maturity. I prefer a north slope of\r\nhigh, level, bottom land, with black soil and clay subsoil. Plant\r\ntwo-year-old, whole-root, round-topped trees, in large holes dug two\r\nfeet deep and filled for six inches with surface soil, packed well. Have\r\nnow in bearing some good seedlings. Grow corn in orchard from eight to\r\nten years, and cultivate the tree rows well with shallow plowing, and\r\nharrow and cultivator. After ten years sow to red clover. Want a\r\nwindbreak of timber on south. Shoot the rabbits. Prune with saw and axe\r\nto \"get nicer apples,\" and think it pays exceedingly well. Prefer to\r\nplant in blocks of a kind, as they are more fruitful. Use stable litter,\r\nbut not close up to the trees. Believe it pays to pasture with hogs, if\r\nnot overstocked. Have canker-worm and codling-moth; spray three times,\r\nthe first before blooming, for canker-worm. Have surely reduced\r\ncodling-moth by spraying. Borers never bother any. Pick by hand from\r\ncommon ladders, with sack over shoulder. Sort into three classes: No. 1\r\nperfect, No. 2, and culls. Have a different man to pick out each grade.\r\nUse eleven-peck barrels; face two layers, then fill, shake, and press.\r\nUsually sell marketable fruit in orchard to shippers. Sell culls by\r\nwagon-loads in orchard. My best near-by market is Emporia, Kan. Have\r\nshipped to a distant market and made it pay. I have stored some in\r\nbarrels in cellar, and all kept well, Winesap perhaps a little the\r\nbetter. Prices range from forty to sixty cents per bushel. I employ the\r\nbest experienced men I can get, and pay one dollar per day of ten hours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. ELLISON, Chautauqua, Chautauqua county: Has lived thirty-two years in\r\nKansas. Has an orchard of 800 trees--300 fifteen years, and 500 twelve\r\nyears planted. Prefers Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, Rawle's Janet and\r\nJonathan for market, and for family use adds Maiden's Blush. Has\r\ndiscarded every other kind; the above are the only profitable ones.\r\nPrefers sandy loam with clay subsoil, high eastern slope, protected on\r\nnorth. Sets three-foot yearling trees in spring, marking out with\r\nfourteen-inch plow, thirty-five feet apart each way, and set at\r\ncrossing. Cultivates with stubble plow in April, then keeps harrow going\r\nuntil August 1. Uses hoe around trees. Grows corn in orchard until ten\r\nyears old; then keeps ground well cultivated. Does not desire\r\nwindbreaks. Feeds the rabbits poisoned fruit. Says borers are not\r\ntroublesome if cultivation is kept up every two weeks through June and\r\nJuly. Prunes any time from January to June, to improve the fruit and\r\nprolong the life of the tree. Says stable litter on all sandy loam, not\r\nnearer than three feet from the tree, will make the fruit larger,\r\ncrisper, and better flavor. Allows no stock but poultry in the orchard.\r\nSprays with London purple, on April 10, 20, 30, and May 10, for\r\ncanker-worms, and destroys them completely. Has cleaned out the\r\ncodling-moth, too. For borers he washes his trees in June and September\r\nwith carbolic acid ten pounds, sulphur forty pounds, lime enough to make\r\na thick whitewash. On picking he sorts into three grades: No. 1, select,\r\nlarge, sound, smooth; No. 2, small and sound; No. 3, knotty and specked.\r\nUses for marketing one-bushel baskets packed full. His best market is in\r\nthe orchard, selling by wagon-loads. He uses some culls for vinegar and\r\ngives many to his neighbors. Does not dry any. Stores some for winter in\r\ntrenches in bulk, in the soil, covered with pure earth, and they keep as\r\nfollows: Missouri Pippin, first; Rawle's Janet, second; Ben Davis,\r\nthird. Prices vary from forty cents to one dollar per bushel. Uses\r\ncommon farm help at sixty cents to eighty cents per day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nN. SANFORD, Oswego, Labette county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-seven\r\nyears. Have an apple orchard of 150 trees, twenty-four years old, ten\r\ninches in diameter. For all purposes I prefer Red June, Jonathan,\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, Rome Beauty, and Winesap. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Ben Davis, White Winter Pearmain, Red Winter Pearmain, and\r\nMissouri Pippin; they don't do well here. I prefer clay bottom land with\r\nnorth aspect. I prefer well-grown two-year-old trees, set a little\r\ndeeper than nurserymen recommend. I cultivate my orchard to corn or\r\npotatoes four years, using a five-tooth cultivator, and cease cropping\r\nafter six years. I plant nothing but raspberries and blackberries in a\r\nbearing orchard. Windbreaks are not essential. For rabbits I wrap the\r\nyoung trees with cloth. I prune the tree while young to give shape and\r\nget rid of dead branches; I think it pays. I do not thin my apples while\r\non the trees; it does not pay. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter\r\nand ashes; would advise their use on all soils. I pasture my orchard in\r\nearly spring and during the fall and winter with horses and cattle;\r\nthink it advisable, and that it pays. My trees are troubled with\r\ncanker-worm, bud moth, root aphis, and twig-borer, and my apples with\r\ncodling-moth, curculio, and gouger. I spray with a force-pump; use Paris\r\ngreen, London purple and Bordeaux mixture for canker-worms and all other\r\npests. I pick my apples from ladders with care; sort into two\r\nclasses--first, all large and sound; second, small and sound; pack them\r\nin eleven-peck barrels as we pick them; fill the barrels full with a\r\nlittle pressure; mark with variety and grade. I wholesale, retail and\r\npeddle my apples; I evaporate the second and third grades and culls. My\r\nbest market is Colorado; I have tried distant markets and found they\r\npaid. I dry apples with a home-made drier, which is quite satisfactory;\r\nafter they are dry we pack in fifty-pound boxes, but do not find a ready\r\nmarket; they pay some years if the quality is good. Am successful in\r\nstoring apples in barrels in a stone cellar, and find Winesaps keep\r\nbest. I have to repack stored apples, losing about one-sixth or\r\none-eighth of them. Do not irrigate. Prices have been from fifty cents\r\nto one dollar per bushel; dried apples from five to nine cents, if\r\nfancy. I employ women at fifty cents per day for preparing the\r\nevaporated apples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC. G. WICKERSHAM, Parsons, Labette county: I have lived in Kansas\r\ntwenty-six years. Have an apple orchard, the oldest of which are\r\ntwenty-seven years. For all purposes I prefer Jonathan, Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin, and Winesap. I prefer hilltop, with the very best of black soil,\r\nhaving a north or northwest slope. I prefer two- or three-year-old\r\nmedium-sized trees, set in holes dug for them. I cultivate my orchard to\r\npotatoes, using a common cultivator, and cease cropping after ten or\r\nfifteen years; nothing should be planted in a bearing orchard.\r\nWindbreaks are essential; would make them of three to six rows of elms.\r\nWe destroy all the rabbits we can. I prune the trees when first set out\r\nto shorten in the limbs; then keep it up every year; it pays big. I do\r\nnot thin the fruit on the trees; the wind does it for me; it pays to not\r\nhave the trees too full. Makes no material difference whether the trees\r\nare in block of one variety or mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard\r\nwith slightly rotted stable litter, and think it pays, and is\r\nbeneficial. I would advise its use on all soils, but not as extensively\r\non rich soils. I pasture my orchard with chickens only; they are a\r\nbenefit and pay well. My apples are troubled with codling-moth,\r\ncurculio, and bud moth. I spray with London purple, Paris green, and\r\nBordeaux mixture. I pick my apples by hand, sort in from three to six\r\ngrades, and put them on hay in the shade. Pack in one- and\r\none-and-a-half-bushel packages. I wholesale, retail and peddle a very\r\nlittle. Give the culls to neighbors who have no apples. Have tried\r\ndistant markets, but it did not pay. Home market is best. I do not dry\r\nany. I store some in a frost-proof house. Have to repack stored apples.\r\nI water my orchard frequently.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nO. W. HECKETHORN, McPherson, McPherson county: I have resided in Kansas\r\ntwenty-four years; have an apple orchard of 350 trees; 180 of them are\r\ntwelve years old; the balance are younger. For market I prefer Missouri\r\nPippin and Maiden's Blush; for family use, Maiden's Blush. I prefer a\r\nsandy loam with an east or northeast aspect. I prefer two-year-old,\r\nlow-headed trees, planted in rows thirty feet apart. I cultivate my\r\norchard as long as the weeds grow, and plant a young orchard to corn,\r\nusing a small cultivator and disc. Cease cropping after eight or nine\r\nyears, and plant nothing in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are essential;\r\nwould make them of peach trees planted close together. I have pruned to\r\nshape trees, but do not prune at all now. I do not thin the fruit while\r\non the trees. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter; I think it\r\nbeneficial, and would advise its use on all soils. I do not pasture my\r\norchard. My trees are troubled with tent-caterpillar, and my apples with\r\ncurculio.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA. B.

For all purposes I prefer Ben Davis, Winesap,\r\nJonathan, and Missouri Pippin. My trees are planted on a hilltop, with\r\nnorth slope, having a black limestone soil. I prefer two-year-old trees,\r\nset in rows twenty feet apart. I cultivate my orchard to sweet corn\r\nuntil four years old, using a plow and harrow, then cease cropping; put\r\nclover in a bearing orchard. We make windbreaks of Osage orange on the\r\nnorth side of the orchard. For rabbits I use lath, and dig borers out. I\r\nprune with a chisel and mallet; think it pays. I do not thin the fruit\r\nwhile on the trees. I do not mix my trees when planting. I fertilize my\r\norchard between the rows with stable litter; would not advise its use on\r\nall soils. I have pastured my orchard with hogs, but do not think it\r\nadvisable, as it does not pay. My trees are troubled with\r\ntent-caterpillar and flathead borer, and my apples with codling-moth. I\r\ndo not spray; my neighbors do, without success. I hand-pick my apples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD. W. COZAD, La Cygne, Linn county: I have resided in the state\r\ntwenty-five years. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Jonathan, Willow Twig,\r\nand Missouri Pippin, and for family orchard, Early Harvest, Maiden's\r\nBlush, Winesap, Rawle's Janet, and Huntsman's Favorite. Have tried and\r\ndiscarded Lawver, Yellow Bellflower, Gilpin, and Cooper's Early White,\r\non account of shy bearing, poor quality, and small size. I would choose\r\nhill for some and valley land for others, according to variety planted;\r\nwould prefer southeast aspect with limestone soil and porous subsoil. I\r\nprefer one-year-old trees. I cultivate my orchard to corn and potatoes,\r\nusing a surface cultivator and harrow; cease cropping at bearing age and\r\nsow to clover. Windbreaks are essential. I would make them of double\r\nrows of evergreens on the north and west. Protect from rabbits and\r\nborers by \"eternal vigilance.\" I prune with a saw and knife for\r\nsymmetry, air, and light, and think it pays. I thin the fruit while on\r\nthe trees, at different times; it pays. I fertilize my orchard with\r\nstable litter and clover; would advise its use on all soils. I pasture\r\nmy orchard with hogs; think it advisable, and that it pays. My trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, root aphis, flathead borer,\r\nand woolly aphis; my apples with codling-moth and curculio. I pick my\r\napples by hand; sort into three classes, sound and large, sound and\r\nsmall, and culls. I sell apples in the orchard, wholesale, retail, and\r\npeddle. Sell my best apples from the cellar, also second grade. Of the\r\nculls we make cider and feed to the hogs. My best market is at home. I\r\ndo not dry any. I am successful in storing apples in barrels in a cellar\r\nand a cave; I find the Gilpin, McAfee, Rawle's Janet and Willow Twig\r\nkeep best. I have to repack stored apples before marketing, losing about\r\none-twentieth of them. I do not irrigate. Prices have been: Summer,\r\ntwenty-five to thirty cents; fall, forty to fifty cents; winter sixty to\r\neighty cents per bushel.

BARNGROVER, Hamilton, Greenwood county: I have been in Kansas\r\nseventeen years, and have an orchard of 100 apple trees fifteen years\r\nold, twenty-four inches in circumference. For market I prefer Ben Davis,\r\nand for family use Winesap. I prefer bottom land, with a black loam soil\r\nand a red clay subsoil. I prefer two-year-old, low-headed trees, set in\r\nbig holes. I cultivate my orchard about every four years with a disc and\r\nharrow, and sow English blue-grass in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential to orchards on the hills; I would make them of a row of maples\r\nbetween every row of apple trees. For rabbits and borers I paint the\r\nbody of the tree with a solution of coal-tar and carbolic acid. I prune\r\nmy trees to protect them from the hard winds; always trim the highest\r\nlimbs--never the low ones. I fertilize my orchard with about twelve\r\ninches of old hay for four years, and think it should be used on all\r\nsoils, as the tree growth will be one-third larger. I pasture my orchard\r\nwith calves, and think it advisable and that it pays. My trees are\r\ntroubled with leaf-rollers. I spray with Paris green. In picking, I use\r\na step-ladder and a pole with a hook on the end. On the under side of\r\nthe pole I sew a long sack [a canvas tube]; the apples fall in this sack\r\nand roll down to me. I pack in barrels; sell in orchard; use the waste\r\napples at home. Have tried distant markets; it did not pay. Do not dry\r\nany. I store apples for winter in barrels, and find White Winter\r\nPearmain keeps best. I have to repack stored apples before marketing;\r\nthe loss depends a great deal on the season. I do not irrigate. Prices\r\nhave been from thirty cents to one dollar per bushel.

For market I prefer Winesap, Missouri Pippin,\r\nBen Davis, and Jonathan, and for family orchard would add Maiden's\r\nBlush. I prefer hilltop with a black loam and an east slope. I prefer\r\none- or two-year-old trees, two feet tall, with good roots, set thirty\r\nfeet apart in rows. I cultivate my orchard to corn for ten years, using\r\na harrow and five-tooth cultivator very shallow. Cease cropping after\r\nten years, and plant turnips in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential; would make them of red cedar, ash, or catalpa, by planting\r\neight by eight feet in rows. I prune my trees when young with a\r\npruning-knife to get rid of all unnecessary limbs; I think it pays. I\r\nfertilize my orchard with stable litter that will not heat, and would\r\nadvise its use on all soils, but lightly on rich soils. I pasture my\r\norchard with hogs, but do not think it advisable; it does not pay. My\r\ntrees are troubled with borers, and my apples with curculio. For insects\r\nnot affected by spraying, I use one box of concentrated lye and four\r\nounces of tincture of tobacco to four gallons of water; wash well with a\r\nswab three times a year--the 15th of June, July, and August.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW.

Prefers for commerce\r\nBen Davis, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and Huntsman's Favorite, and for\r\nfamily orchard adds Maiden's Blush and Rome Beauty. Prefers north slope,\r\nupland. Plants two-year-olds, with straight centers, at sixteen to\r\neighteen feet apart, in rows twenty-two to twenty-four feet apart.\r\nCultivates with two-horse cultivator, often enough to keep the weeds\r\ndown; then harrows, aiming to keep the ground mellow. Grows corn from\r\nnine to ten years, then clover; says small grain hurts trees. Thinks\r\nevergreens best for windbreaks, but does not think such protection\r\nessential. Keeps dogs for the rabbits. Prunes with hedge shears, and\r\nsays it certainly pays. Believes barn-yard litter beneficial in any\r\norchard, on any soil. While he thinks pasturing not advisable, and that\r\nit will not pay, he says he will probably pasture in fore part of\r\nseasons with calves, after he has seeded to clover. Sprays with London\r\npurple and lime as soon as canker-worm appears. Is not troubled with\r\nborers. Would irrigate if he could.

For\r\nmarket I use Ben Davis; for family, Early Harvest, Winesap, and\r\nRomanite. I prefer hilltop, with an eastern slope, black loam soil, with\r\ngravelly subsoil. I plant two-year-old thrifty trees, thirty-three feet\r\napart each way, in the spring. I cultivate until they bear, growing corn\r\nand potatoes, after that grass. I prefer a disc cultivator. I think\r\nwindbreaks are a great help; and Osage orange is the best I know of. For\r\nrabbits I tie stalks or wire cloth around the tree. Have never had any\r\nborers. I trim with a saw and knife to take out superfluous wood and\r\ngive light, and I think it pays. I never have thinned any. I think\r\nbarn-yard fertilizer will pay in the orchard. I pasture my orchard very\r\nlittle, and think it does not pay. I have never sprayed any, and believe\r\ntent-caterpillar is the worst insect that troubles me. I pick in a sack\r\ntied over my shoulder, and sort into three classes--number one, the very\r\nbest; number two, those that are specked; number three, culls. I\r\ngenerally sell to retailers, at our home market, and make cider of the\r\nculls; never tried a distant market. Have never dried any. I store\r\nsometimes in bulk in a cellar under the house, and find that Winesap and\r\nRomanite keep the best. Prices run from twenty-five cents to one dollar\r\nper bushel, and dried fruit from two and a half to six cents per pound.\r\nI use regular monthly farm help.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN A.

I think Ben Davis\r\nand Missouri Pippin are the best varieties for all purposes. Discarded\r\nthe Bellflower because it would not bear. I prefer bottom land with a\r\nnorth aspect, black soil, and clay subsoil. Plant good one-year-old\r\ntrees, 33x20 feet. Cultivate with plow and \"gopher.\" I grow corn and\r\ncastor-beans in the orchard as long as it will pay. Believe windbreaks\r\nare necessary, made of anything that will check the wind; would plant\r\ntrees on the south and west. Keep rabbits off by wrapping. I prune\r\nenough to keep in shape. I believe it pays to pasture the orchard with\r\nhogs in the winter, and think they get away with canker-worms. I spray\r\nfor canker-worm and codling-moth with London purple, and think I have\r\nchecked the codling-moth to some extent. I pick and sort by hand in two\r\nclasses only--marketable and culls. I wholesale in bulk, make cider of\r\nthe culls, and find my best market in Texas. I never dry any; never\r\nstore any for winter; have never irrigated.

COCHRAN, Ottumwa, Lyon county: Have lived in Kansas thirteen\r\nyears; my orchard is in Coffey county, and contains 800 trees; 100 have\r\nbeen planted thirty-five years, and 700 twelve years. I market Winesap,\r\nBen Davis, and Missouri Pippin, and add to this for family use Jonathan\r\nand some early apples. I prefer ashy bottom land. I would plant trees in\r\ngood condition thirty by thirty-five feet. Cultivate in corn about eight\r\nyears, then sow to clover. I believe that a windbreak of hedge or\r\nforest-trees should be planted on the southwest, in rows four feet\r\napart. I prune in fall and winter with a saw, and my experience is that\r\nit makes better fruit. I have never thinned on the tree. Barn-yard\r\nlitter scattered through the orchard improves the land. I pasture with\r\nhogs early in spring and late in fall; they eat the refuse apples. Am\r\ntroubled with canker-worm, web-worm, and codling-moth. I spray with\r\nLondon purple and air-slaked lime just as soon as I see the insect, or\r\nas soon as the trees are in bloom. I think I have reduced the\r\ncodling-moth. I pick in a sack tied and hung on the shoulder, using a\r\nladder against the tree. I sort into two classes: No. 1, clear of rot;\r\nNo. 2, clear of bruises. Pack in eleven-peck barrels, full and pressed.\r\nI wholesale mostly; suits me best to sell in orchard. The culls and\r\nseconds I sell at home. My best market is Fort Worth, Texas. Freight is\r\ntoo high to send farther. Never dry any; store in a cellar in barrels\r\nfor home use only. Am not always successful. Winesap keeps best. I lose\r\none-fourth sometimes.

Have tried and discarded Esopus\r\nSpitzenburg, on account of sun-scald. Prefer hilltop with square-jointed\r\n[?] subsoil, and northeast slope, deep, rich soil. I plant in check\r\nplats. Have tried root grafts. I cultivate until the trees interfere\r\nwith working. I plant young orchard to corn and potatoes; bearing\r\norchard to nothing, and cease cropping when it injures the limbs of the\r\ntrees. Windbreaks are essential sometimes, and should be made of Osage\r\norange, because of its quick growth. I prune when limbs interfere. I\r\nthin apples a little. Do not mix my trees; bees do the work. Fertilizers\r\nare beneficial on all soils. Pasture my orchard with hogs and calves. My\r\ntrees are troubled with canker-worm, root aphis, bag-worm, flathead\r\nborer, roundhead borer, woolly aphis, twig borer, fall web-worm,\r\nleaf-roller, leaf-crumpler, and others. My apples are troubled with\r\ncodling-moth, curculio, and gouger. Spray when the blossoms are open,\r\nwith Bordeaux mixture; have not reduced the codling-moth. I use the\r\nknife on borers and insects that are not affected by spraying. Sort into\r\ntwo classes; have both perfect. Sell in the orchard sometimes. Store\r\nsome apples for winter market; have not tried artificial cold storage.\r\nWe have to repack stored apples before marketing, losing one to ten per\r\ncent. The prevailing price has been sixty cents per bushel. I employ men\r\nat from fifteen to eighteen dollars per month.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF. L. KENOYER, Independence, Montgomery county: I have lived in the\r\nstate ten years, and have an apple orchard of 240 trees from three to\r\nnine years old. For market I prefer Jonathan, Missouri Pippin, and Ben\r\nDavis, and for family use add Maiden's Blush. I prefer hilltop with a\r\nsandy loam and a porous subsoil. I prefer two-year-old, low-headed\r\ntrees, with plenty of roots. I plant them one rod north and south, and\r\ntwo rods east and west. I will cultivate my orchard as long as the trees\r\nlive with a Planet jr. twelve-tooth cultivator. I plant strawberries in\r\na bearing orchard; they are as good as clover. Windbreaks would be\r\nbeneficial; I would make them of Osage orange. For rabbits I rub blood\r\non the trees. I dig the borers out with a knife and wire. I prune very\r\nlittle, with the pruning shears, to remove watersprouts and interlocking\r\nlimbs. It preserves their symmetry, but does not make them more\r\nfruitful. I do not thin the fruit while on the trees; the wind does it\r\nfor me. My trees are in mixed plantings. I fertilize my orchard with\r\nstable litter between the trees. It is very beneficial, and I would\r\nadvise its use on all soils excepting very rich bottoms, where it would\r\ncause too much wood growth at the expense of the fruit. I do not pasture\r\nmy orchard; it is not advisable. My trees are troubled with canker-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, root aphis, roundhead borer, and leaf-crumpler, and my\r\napples with codling-moth and curculio. I am successful in spraying,\r\nusing London purple with a pump when the canker-worms appear, and a few\r\ndays afterward. For root-lice I remove the earth from around the trees\r\nand pour in tobacco water. I do not dry any. I do not irrigate. Prices\r\nhave been forty cents for apples in the fall, one dollar per bushel\r\nduring the winter, while home-grown lasted, and two dollars per bushel\r\nnow (April). Dried apples sold for five to ten cents per pound,\r\naccording to quality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. H. BILSING, Udall, Cowley county: I have lived in Kansas twenty-seven\r\nyears. Have an orchard of sixty apple trees from sixteen to twenty-six\r\nyears old. For market I prefer Ben Davis, Limber Twig, Jonathan, and\r\nGrimes's Golden Pippin, and for family use Jonathan, Grimes's Golden\r\nPippin, Red June, and Maiden's Blush. Have tried and discarded Big\r\nRomanite; it is a good grower but a poor bearer. I prefer bottom land\r\nwith sandy loam and clay subsoil, and a north slope. Prefer thrifty\r\ntwo-year-old trees, set in land which has been plowed as deeply as\r\npossible, and the soil loosened fifteen to eighteen inches by digging.\r\nMy trees are set 30x30 feet; this is a little too wide north and south.\r\nI am still cultivating my first planting of trees, use a plow, harrow,\r\nand cultivator. Plant corn in a young orchard, and cease cropping after\r\neight or ten years. Windbreaks are essential; would make them of peach\r\ngroves for quick growth, or for slower and surer growth would make them\r\nof several rows of Osage orange or ash, set fifteen to sixteen feet east\r\nand west by breaking rows. I prune my trees from the beginning with a\r\npocket-knife; think it pays. Do not thin the fruit on the trees.\r\nFertilize my orchard with ashes and stable litter; think it beneficial,\r\nas it keeps the ground from packing, and also keeps the trees vigorous;\r\nwould not advise its use on very sandy soils. Do not pasture my orchard;\r\nam going to try it with young pigs and calves. My trees are troubled\r\nwith root aphis and borers, and my apples with codling-moth, curculio,\r\nand gouger. Have sprayed three seasons, soon after the blossom fell and\r\nuntil the apples were the size of marbles, using London purple; think I\r\nkilled the first brood of codling-moth, but a later brood came which\r\nhurt the fruit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF. H. BURNETT, Benedict, Wilson county: I have lived in the state\r\nfifteen years. Have 2200 apple trees six years old, of fair size.\r\nPlanted for market Gano, Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Jonathan, and\r\nfor family use Jonathan, Winesap, Gano, Early Harvest, and Maiden's\r\nBlush. Bottom land is best in this locality. I prefer soil somewhat\r\nclayish, underlaid with limestone, with a north or east slope. Prefer\r\ngood one- and two-year-old, stocky, low-headed trees. Would plant on\r\nupland twenty by thirty-two feet, and on rich bottom twenty-four by\r\nthirty-six feet. I believe in thorough cultivation, and during the first\r\ntwo years I use the hoe. I cultivate until five or six years old,\r\nusually growing corn, as it protects the trees from the strong south\r\nwinds. I then sow to clover, changing every two or three years to\r\ncastor-beans or corn. Trees planted close north and south form their own\r\nwindbreaks. For rabbits, wrap the trees. I prune a little to keep the\r\ntrees from getting too heavy on the north side. I should thin Missouri\r\nPippins to keep from overbearing. I should use sawdust and barn-yard\r\nfertilizer on hard-pan spots. I allow no live stock in the orchard but\r\npoultry. Am troubled some with leaf-rollers and canker-worm. I spray as\r\nsoon as the leaves start, for canker-worm and leaf-roller, using one\r\npound of London purple to 120 gallons of water. For borers, keep the\r\ntrees thrifty; borers cannot thrive, as the sap will kill them. I\r\nbelieve it would be well during the first two years to wash the trees\r\nwith a solution of soft soap, coal-oil, and water, in May and June. I\r\nsort in first, second, and cider or culls; pack in three-bushel barrels\r\nso full they cannot bruise. I expect to put in an evaporator and use\r\nnatural gas for fuel, and think it will pay. I recommend subsoiling to\r\nretain moisture. Prices have ranged here from thirty to fifty cents per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nF. S. HALL, Fulton, Bourbon county: Has lived in Kansas fourteen years.\r\nHave 10,000 apple trees from two to eight years old. For commercial\r\npurposes the Ben Davis and Arkansas Black are doing best. Will not plant\r\nany more Missouri Pippins. My orchard is on a hill, with northeast\r\nslope, black soil, set thirty-three feet east and west and sixteen feet\r\nnorth and south. Set one- and two-year-old well-branched trees.\r\nCultivate entirely with a disc, and allow nothing to grow within six\r\nfeet of the trees. Grow only clover, and expect to grow only clover in\r\nmy orchard. Think an Osage hedge a good windbreak. Use tar paper and\r\ntraps against rabbits. Prune nothing above twenty inches from the\r\nground. Never thinned apples on trees. Fertilize with ashes and all the\r\nmanure I can get, and turn under clover. Think such fertilizers\r\nbeneficial for apples on all soils. Opposed to pasturing an orchard. Not\r\nmuch troubled with insects. Spray before and after blooming, first with\r\nBordeaux mixture, then sulphate of copper and either Paris green or\r\nLondon purple. Think I have reduced the codling-moth by this method.\r\nKeep down borers by cultivation and a wash of lime, concentrated lye,\r\nand carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. N. MARK, Strawn, Coffey county: Have lived in Kansas thirty years.\r\nHave an orchard of twelve acres; trees twelve years old. For commercial\r\npurposes I prefer Winesap and Ben Davis. Timber bottom is best. I\r\ncultivate my orchard to corn and potatoes, and cease cropping when ten\r\nor twelve years old; plant potatoes in a bearing orchard. Windbreaks are\r\nessential on the south; would make them of forest-trees. To protect from\r\nrabbits I wrap young trees, or kill rabbits, cut open, and rub\r\nthoroughly on the tree. I prune my trees to give proper shape, and think\r\nit beneficial, especially on poor land, as it makes the trees more\r\nproductive. Do not thin fruit on the trees. I pasture my orchard\r\ncarefully with hogs and calves at any time when it is not wet. Trees are\r\ntroubled with canker-worm. I spray early and often with London purple. I\r\npick my apples in sacks from ladders. The shipper [buyer] sorts from\r\nbarrels in orchard. I sell my first grade in the orchard; also second-\r\nand third-grade apples in the orchard. We sell the culls. Do not dry\r\nany; does not pay. I store very few. Average price of apples is fifty\r\ncents per bushel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nW. M. FRENCH, Chicopee, Crawford county: I have resided in the state\r\neighteen years. Have an apple orchard of 200 trees twelve years old,\r\naveraging six inches in diameter. For market I prefer Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap, Missouri Pippin, Willow Twig, and Jonathan; and for family\r\norchard would add Early Harvest, Maiden's Blush, and Rambo. Have tried\r\nand discarded Limber Twig; it does not mature. I prefer bottom with an\r\neastern or northern slope, having a good deep soil with a clay subsoil.\r\nI prefer three-year-old, stocky trees, set in holes dug 3x3 feet and\r\n2-1/2 feet deep, filled with surface soil. I cultivate my orchard to\r\ncorn as long as I can without injuring the trees, and use a plow; avoid\r\nridging too much. I cease cropping after nine to twelve years. I sow the\r\nbearing orchard to millet or something to be mowed. Windbreaks are not\r\nessential, but think they would be beneficial; would make them of\r\ncatalpa or maples, set in two or three rows on north, south and west\r\nsides. I prune my trees with a saw to keep the top from getting too\r\nheavy; I think it beneficial, and that it pays. Shall not thin my fruit\r\nthis year. I can see no difference whether trees are in blocks of one\r\nkind or mixed. I fertilize my orchard with stable litter, putting it in\r\ntrenches between the trees; I avoid putting it around them. I think it\r\nhas proven beneficial, and would advise its use on all soils, unless\r\nvery rich and the tree growth very strong. I pasture my orchard a little\r\nwith calves, but do not think it advisable. My trees are troubled with\r\ntent-caterpillar. I do not spray. I hand-pick in a basket from a\r\nstep-ladder. I sort into two classes, and wholesale, retail, and peddle.\r\nThe home market takes all my best apples; the culls are fed to hogs and\r\nmade into cider. Never have tried distant markets. Do not dry any. Am\r\nsuccessful at storing apples in bulk in a cellar; find Ben Davis,\r\nWinesap, Willow Twig and Rawle's Janet keep best.

ROSS, Havana, Montgomery county: Have lived in Kansas twenty-seven\r\nyears; have an orchard of 100 apple trees twenty-three years old. I\r\nprefer for all purposes Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin, and Winesap. Have\r\ntried and discarded Rawle's Janet and Romanite. I prefer low land at\r\nfoot of hills, with deep loam subsoil and a medium slope. I set my trees\r\ntwenty feet apart. I cultivate in oats and corn up to bearing with\r\ncommon twelve-inch stirring plow. Windbreaks are essential on north;\r\nwould make them of Osage orange planted in rows. Rabbits are hard to\r\ncontend with; for borers I use a solution of slaked lime. I prune with a\r\nsaw; do not think it very beneficial, as the rain gets in, and the wood\r\ndecays. I never thin apples. My trees are in mixed varieties. I mulch my\r\ntrees with straw, and think it beneficial. I pasture with calves and\r\nhogs; do not think it advisable; it does not pay. Am somewhat troubled\r\nwith insects; I spray with a solution of coal-oil, using a small pump;\r\nthink I have reduced the codling-moth. For borers I dissolve lime to a\r\npaste in water, and apply to the roots with a scrub broom. I pick my\r\nfruit from ladders. I sort into three classes: first, second, and third.\r\nI use common barrels to pack the fruit in; mark, and send by freight to\r\nnear-by markets. I wholesale sometimes, and sometimes sell in orchard;\r\nmarket my best apples at near-by towns; I make cider and vinegar of\r\nculls. I dry some fruit; use a large pan filled with hot water; then put\r\nin sacks and boxes. I find a ready market; think it pays. I store some\r\napples in a cellar in large, open boxes, and in bulk. Some rot; those\r\nthat keep best are Winesap, Rawle's Janet, and Romanite. We have to sort\r\nstored apples before marketing them; we lose from one-fourth to\r\none-third of them. I do not irrigate.

I prefer bottom land, with a black loam and clay subsoil, with\r\nnorth slope. I plant two-year-old, medium-top trees, in well-cultivated\r\nground, and mix the top soil with the roots. I have tried root grafts,\r\nbut not satisfactory. I cultivate shallow every year, using the\r\ncultivator after the tree is grown. I grow oats in a young orchard, but\r\nnothing in a bearing orchard, and cease cropping when about eight years\r\nold. Windbreaks are essential on high ground. I would make them of\r\nwalnut trees planted in rows. I never thinned the fruit. My trees are in\r\nmixed plantings, and prove satisfactory.

I prefer for commercial orchard Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin,\r\nWinesap, and Gano; and for family orchard Winesap, Missouri Pippin, and\r\nJonathan. I prefer hilltop, with black loam and porous subsoil, with\r\nnorth slope. I plant three-year-old whole-root grafts. I cultivate in\r\ncorn for five years with one-horse cultivator; seed a bearing orchard to\r\nclover. Windbreaks are essential on the south. I prune with the saw to\r\nlet the sun in, and think it beneficial. Never have thinned apples. I\r\nsometimes use stable litter as a fertilizer, but would not advise its\r\nuse on all soils. Sometimes I pasture my orchard with hogs and horses,\r\nand think it advisable. I hand-pick my apples. I sell in the orchard,\r\npeddle the second and third grades, make vinegar of culls, and feed some\r\nto hogs; never tried distant markets. Never dry any. Prices have been\r\nfrom $1 to $1.50 per barrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF THE FOREGOING DISTRICT REPORTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Davis is the leading market apple, followed closely by Missouri\r\nPippin. These two lead all others, and are followed by Winesap and\r\nJonathan. Rawle's Janet, York Imperial, Huntsman's Favorite, Grimes's\r\nGolden Pippin and Maiden's Blush are also favorites. We find the Yellow\r\nBellflower, Newtown Pippin, Lawver and a few others are condemned all\r\nover the state.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern third of the state hilltop or slope is preferred to\r\nbottom land, but in the central and western portions bottom land is\r\npreferred. The reason for this is obvious. Any good soil is\r\nsatisfactory, if subsoil is porous.\r\n\r\nThe favorite distance seems to be thirty-two feet east and west and\r\nsixteen to twenty feet north and south, some putting peach or\r\nearly-bearing apples between, the wide way, to be cut out when they\r\ncrowd. This undoubtedly brings the quickest returns, but many believe it\r\nrobs the permanent trees of their future sustenance.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four prefer one-year-old trees; 7 one to two years old; 153\r\ntwo-year-old; 10 two- to three-year-old; 21 three-year-old; 3 want\r\nfour-year-old, and 59 give no age. It is only a matter of cost and\r\nconvenience. A one-year-old tree costs less and allows the would-be\r\norchardist to set more trees for a given amount of cash. The one- and\r\ntwo-year-old trees require the removal of less earth, and are more\r\nreadily handled and planted. There is no reason why an apple tree three\r\ninches in diameter cannot be transplanted as easily as an elm or maple.\r\nA man is willing to set a few large shade-trees at a cost of one dollar\r\nto five dollars per tree, but cannot feel that it is economy to set\r\norchard trees at as great individual expense.\r\n\r\n\"Whole-root grafts\" is a misleading appellation, as it will be found to\r\nbe only a crown graft. Its advocates make great claims that are at\r\nvariance with the facts. There can scarcely be such a thing unless\r\ngrafted on a seedling without removal of such seedling from the earth.\r\nOur best nurserymen prefer the second cut, about one and one-half to\r\nthree inches taken from the seedling root a couple of inches below the\r\ncrown. In any case the piece of root taken has little influence on the\r\nfuture tree. All our ordinary varieties make roots from the scion, and\r\nthe original seedling root may be found--like the piece of potato we\r\nplant--shriveled and useless in the midst of the new roots. The nature\r\nof the root growth shows this plainly, as all its peculiarities will be\r\nfound to be a counterpart of the roots of the variety from which the\r\nscion was cut. It is folly to pay any added price for so-called\r\n\"whole-root grafts.\"\r\n\r\nA very great majority believe in thorough cultivation, at least for from\r\nsix to ten years; some during the life of the tree. Nearly all agree\r\nthat Indian corn is the best crop to grow in a young orchard; it shades\r\nthe ground, and protects from wind. The corn in a young orchard should\r\nnot be cut in the fall, neither should the stalks be pastured; let them\r\nstand till spring as a partial protection; it pays.\r\n\r\nMany parts of the state, especially the western half, believe windbreaks\r\non the south and west very valuable, if not quite necessary.\r\nForest-trees with the outside row or rows of Russian mulberries, and\r\nperhaps an Osage orange hedge, seem to meet the general opinion.\r\n\r\nAs a protection from rabbits, the ever-present corn-stalks seem most\r\neconomical, and the favorite. The cost is little, and the boys and\r\ngirls, or the farmer and his wife, at odd times can put them on. It is\r\nan open question as to the benefit or harm of leaving them on\r\npermanently for the first five years. It looks slovenly, but certainly\r\nhas many arguments in its favor.\r\n\r\nThe serio-comic idea of boring into an apple tree and placing therein\r\nsulphur, asafetida or other drugs does not really deserve a serious\r\nthought. It is impossible for the tree to assimilate these substances,\r\nespecially sulphur, and carry them to the foliage or fruit for\r\npreventive or any other purpose. Boring and plugging--like any other\r\nthreatened death to the tree--may cause temporary fruitfulness, as also\r\nwill girdling.\r\n\r\nWhile several washes are claimed to prevent or destroy borers, the large\r\nmajority of extensive orchardists believe the knife and a hooked wire in\r\nthe hands of a thoroughgoing employee the best and surest way of knowing\r\nthat you destroy the larva of this persistent and destructive insect.\r\n\r\nSmearing trees with any undiluted grease, especially axle grease made\r\nfrom petroleum refuse, is hazardous, and the man who advises it is an\r\nenemy to your orchard. If you have applied it, the sooner you wash it\r\noff the longer will your orchard thrive.\r\n\r\nPruning has its advocates, but the Eastern style of a long stem has\r\nscarcely a follower in our state; a great majority simply cut out\r\n\"watersprouts\" and limbs that cross or rub, or are wind-broken.\r\n\r\nThinning on the trees has many advocates, but few followers. All admit\r\nit would often improve the size and quality, yet most growers believe\r\nthe difference would not be sufficient to pay for the labor, and it\r\nwould require skilled labor to do it without injury.\r\n\r\nA large number, perhaps a majority, believe it pays to apply\r\nfertilizers, more especially barn-yard litter, to the orchard; but cases\r\nare known where it has done much harm. All agree that it should be kept\r\naway from the body of the tree.\r\n\r\nAs to pasturing the orchard, some think it pays; others that it does no\r\nharm; others still--and they are many--condemn it. The larger proportion\r\nof those who pasture confine the stock to calves, colts, and pigs. Some\r\nwould allow only poultry in the orchard, and the poultry must not roost\r\nin the trees. This latter point is an excellent one.\r\n\r\nWe find we have plenty of insects; this is natural. Insects settle in a\r\ncountry that provides proper food for them and their larva. As apple\r\ntrees are planted in new localities the insects that delight in\r\napple-tree wood, apple-tree roots, apple-tree foliage and apple-tree\r\nfruits immigrate, grow, and multiply.\r\n\r\nSpraying or using some preventive or destroyer has become necessary, and\r\nthe man who believes it unnecessary and intends to trust to nature or\r\nprovidence or God will find no truer saying than \"God helps those who\r\nhelp themselves.\" Sit down calmly and watch the worms eat your trees,\r\ntrust to the woodpecker and the sparrows, and you will in time buy\r\napples from your more active, thoroughgoing neighbor, or go without.\r\n\r\nMethods of picking do not vary much, yet all agree that it should be\r\ndone carefully. If shaken from the tree, poured out carelessly, or\r\njolted about in a lumber wagon, it simply increases the culls and\r\ndecreases the cash returns.\r\n\r\nSorting is done in various ways (a sorting table or device is explained\r\nelsewhere), but a majority seem to make three classes: First class, the\r\nunblemished best of each variety; culls, which are the unmarketable,\r\nspecked, bruised and gnarled fruit; second class, which are between the\r\nother two, and really valuable for immediate use. In some cases the\r\n\"second best\" have been put in cold storage, and they sold well after\r\nthe usual fall glut.\r\n\r\nPacking: While there are many who handle in a small way in boxes--and\r\nthe time is near when all fancy apples will be marketed in boxes--yet\r\nall the larger growers use barrels, and it is encouraging to find they\r\nuse full twelve-peck barrels. The eleven-peck barrels should be\r\nboycotted out of existence.\r\n\r\nMarketing: In our large apple-growing districts the crop is generally\r\nwholesaled, either in the orchard or subject to delivery at the\r\nrailroad, generally in barrels. In the western half of the state the\r\napples are largely taken in bulk, in wagons, hauled farther west and\r\nsouth, and sold at a good profit to the wagoner. Thousands of\r\nwagon-loads are thus disposed of every year. The same wagons often\r\nappear in the same neighborhood year after year, to the mutual advantage\r\nof all. Shipping to distant markets by the growers, especially when\r\nconsigned, has been generally unsatisfactory. I need not give reasons;\r\nmy own experience along similar lines makes me \"hot under the hat\" when\r\nI think over it.\r\n\r\nDrying is not practiced to the extent that it ought to be. It seems\r\nalmost a sin to allow so many thousands of bushels of apples to rot on\r\nthe ground every year simply because the owner lacks faith in his\r\nability to turn them into a product that will keep while he looks up a\r\nmarket. Dried apples are in demand--hundreds of tons of them--and Kansas\r\ndried apples stand as good chances to bring as remunerative prices to\r\nthe manufacturer as those from other states. If the work is economically\r\ndone a profit is sure. Storing for winter is described elsewhere.\r\n\r\nCold storage, cave storage, and cellar storage: All know that, after the\r\nperishable and inferior apples are gone, good winter apples bring sure\r\nand large returns. How best to preserve them is a vital question. The\r\nart of keeping apples by the artificial cold-storage process is yet\r\nimperfect and unsatisfactory, and the losses have been so great that,\r\nunless the owner of the plant will take part of the risk, at least to\r\nthe extent of his fee, he will find the average grower standing back. To\r\nlose your apples, and then pay fifty cents per barrel to the man whose\r\nignorance or carelessness may have caused the loss, is a burden too\r\nheavy to be borne. The hillside cave is described elsewhere, and the\r\norchardist who has such a cave well built, and gives it careful\r\nattention, will save a large portion of the fee, and have his apples\r\nalways under his own supervision, besides saving in hauling, and perhaps\r\nrailroad freight to and from a distant cold-storage plant. House\r\ncellars, small caves and buried heaps each and all have their advocates,\r\nmostly for family use or among the small growers.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be determined that the Winesap is the better keeper,\r\nfollowed closely by the Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis. Of less\r\nmarketable varieties, Rawle's Janet and Rambo seem to keep best. The per\r\ncent. of loss, excepting in a few cases, does not seem great considering\r\nthe (usually) greatly increased value of the sound apples.\r\n\r\nThe reports from those who irrigate are not as full as we could wish. It\r\nis claimed that with irrigation every apple becomes a perfect specimen\r\nof its kind; that there are no culls. If this is so, and we hope it is,\r\nwhat a grand opening for those rightly situated.\r\n\r\nOur Lakin correspondent sells his apples at top prices at the tree for\r\ncash, to men who could but do not heed the injunction, \"Go thou and do\r\nlikewise.\" Prices, like wages, vary greatly. Apples put on board cars in\r\na northeastern county at twenty cents per bushel often retail in western\r\ngroceries at one dollar per bushel. The railroad and grocer get the\r\n\"lion's share.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, a close study of all that is in this book ought to give an\r\nimpetus to the planting of proper varieties, the careful and complete\r\ndestruction of insects, the growing, picking, packing and marketing of\r\nmore profitable apples, all to the glory of the Kansas grower and\r\nincidentally swelling his bank account. This means better dwellings,\r\nbetter furniture therein, better food on the tables, better education\r\nfor the children, and more and better literature in the house. If these\r\naims are realized, then the labor of the compiler shall not have been in\r\nvain, but will prove to be a help in making Kansas and the Kansas apple\r\nknown throughout the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS ARTICLES RELATING TO ORCHARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE CULTURE.\r\n\r\n     A paper read by JACOB GOOD, of Coffeyville, Kan., before the Kansas\r\n     State Horticultural Society, at a summer meeting in Coffeyville,\r\n     June 22, 1898.\r\n\r\nBeginning in the early Roman period, the apple has been handed down\r\nthrough the successive ages as the standard fruit. True, the hard,\r\nbitter, uneatable crab or wild apple of former times was not much like\r\nthe tempting apple of to-day; yet it is the parent of all, or nearly\r\nall, the varieties of apples so much prized at the present time. From\r\nits great hardiness, easy cultivation, and long continuance through the\r\nwhole twelve months, it may be styled the \"king\" of all fruits. The\r\napple tree is now one of the most widely diffused of fruit-trees, and in\r\nthe estimation of many is the most valuable. But what has brought about\r\nthis great change in tree and fruit? The same cause which makes the man\r\nof America or Europe superior to the tribes of northern Africa or India.\r\nThe same cause by which the most wonderful inventions of any age have\r\nbeen placed before the public, viz., cultivation and constant attention.\r\nHaving made these questions a study for twenty-five years or more, and\r\nhaving gathered all the points possible from the experience of the\r\nfruit-growers with whom we have come in contact, we have become\r\nthoroughly convinced that the growth of a perfect fruit is possible in\r\nthis climate. One of the main difficulties in a general fruit-growing\r\nbusiness is encountered in a hard subsoil--too hard when it is dry and\r\ntoo soft and yielding when wet. Deep and thorough draining is therefore\r\na great requisite in tree culture.\r\n\r\nThe next step would be the means for securing plenty of moisture. We\r\nwould first open trenches each way not less than twenty-five feet apart.\r\nThey should be thrown out as deep as can be done with a plow, then\r\nfollowed by subsoiler twelve to eighteen inches deep. Draw the surface\r\nearth back into the crosses creating a mound. Plant the trees there and\r\nfill up the ditches by back-furrowing, and bring the land to a perfect\r\nlevel. It will not pay to plant trees on hard-pan soil without\r\npreparation. It is better to avoid the hard-pan altogether, and select a\r\ndeep, rich subsoil. Trees planted in river bottoms have been known to be\r\nvigorous and productive after twenty-five years; while those on the\r\nprairie hard-pan planted at the same time have entirely disappeared. The\r\nbest time for planting is in November, in order that the fiber roots may\r\nbe ready for the first warm days of February. Nice, healthy trees, from\r\ntwo to three years old, should be selected; cut the tops back and trim\r\noff most of the fiber roots. The reason for cutting the tops back is to\r\nmake the tree more productive, more easily harvested, and to aid in\r\nkeeping off the tree borers, of which we will speak later. Our orchards\r\nshould not be allowed to grow up in waste and neglect, neither should\r\nthey be planted in those things which sap the life of the soil and\r\nleave nothing to sustain the tree. One of the main causes of\r\nnon-productiveness of the apple orchard is land starvation. An orchard\r\ncannot produce fruit in addition to a crop of wheat, oats, rye, etc.;\r\nand so, if a man continues to take off crops of these every year, he\r\nsimply does it at the expense of his trees. There are crops, however,\r\nwhich may be used with good effect, such as corn, peas, hay, potatoes,\r\netc. In this the owner gets the profit of his fruit and also the use of\r\nhis land. Yet, with all our care of the soil, minuteness in following\r\ndirections as to setting out and trimming, etc., there are other\r\ndifficulties still to overcome.\r\n\r\nMany kinds of insects may infest the trunks and larger branches of the\r\ntrees. Among them are the apple-tree louse, round- and flathead borers,\r\nSan Jose scale, canker-worm, tent-caterpillar, etc. I would name the\r\nborers and San Jose scale [None yet found in the state.--Sec.] as being\r\nthe worst of the pests with which to contend. The borers attack the\r\ntrunks and larger limbs of the trees; they seek the sunny side of the\r\ntree, not being found where the sap is abundant or where there is a\r\ncontinual shade. Under the first they drown, and under the last they\r\nweaken and die. This is a strong argument in favor of low heading and\r\nshady growth of the trees. The parent of the borer, a long, green or\r\npale brown beetle, may be caught and destroyed, but it is not to be\r\npresumed that all the beetles can be caught; it becomes necessary to\r\nexamine the trees quite often, in order to destroy the worms hatched\r\nfrom the eggs of the uncaptured beetles. To detect the spots which\r\nindicate the whereabouts of these worms is, to the inexperienced, quite\r\na difficult undertaking; for during the spring, and until quite late in\r\nthe summer, there are no external marks save a small speck, or perhaps a\r\ndark blue line so fine that it will not attract the attention of those\r\nnot understanding the cause. When they are first detected a sharp knife\r\nmay be used to remove them, but if they have entered the wood, about the\r\nonly way of removing them is by means of a probe made of common broom\r\nwire, with which to thrust them through or drag them out of their holes.\r\n\r\nThe San Jose scale, a native of Australia, was first found on the\r\nAmerican continent in California in 1873. It has not troubled Kansas\r\nyet, but it is quite prevalent in the Western States, and, as it spreads\r\nrapidly, it is much feared. Its detection is almost the work of a\r\nspecialist, yet there are a few general characteristics which may be\r\ndetected by the naked eye; for instance, the bark of the tree loses its\r\nvigorous, healthy appearance, and takes on a rough, gray, scurfy\r\ndeposit. As yet I have heard of no permanent cure. Spraying has a great\r\ndeal to do with keeping off the insects--of which the canker-worm is\r\ngetting to be one of the worst--from the upper branches of the trees. It\r\nis a mistake to think that a tree should not be sprayed because it has\r\nnot been infested by any insect or fungous growth. The attacks of both\r\nare often unnoticed at first, and the man who is not prepared for them\r\noften neglects spraying until it is too late to save the crop of that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nMy experience in regard to the varieties of apples grown has been quite\r\nvaried. My first orchard, in 1871, did well; I took great pains in\r\nsetting it out, and for five years there were none of the injurious\r\ninsects which make us so much trouble. In my second orchard, ten years\r\nlater, I made great mistakes in the varieties I chose, some of them not\r\nbeing adapted to either soil or climate. By the time I set my third\r\norchard, six years from then, my experience had taught me that the\r\nvarieties which were best for home and commercial purposes, and which\r\nwere best adapted to both the soil and climate, were the Ben Davis,\r\nMissouri Pippin, and Mother, and in these varieties I planted most of my\r\norchard. The habits of the Ben Davis and Missouri Pippin are too well\r\nknown to need further description. In my orchard I found them both\r\nshort-lived. My Ben Davis began to die out at twenty years, and a very\r\nfew reached the age of twenty-six. The Mother is an apple not so well\r\nknown. It originated at Bolton, Mass. Tree is moderately vigorous,\r\nupright, and productive; one of the best apples on the list there, and I\r\nconsider it equally so here. Thomas, the American fruit culturist, in\r\nhis description of the apple, says it is rather large, oblong, ovate,\r\napproaching conical; slightly and obtusely ribbed; color a light, warm,\r\nrich red, on a yellow ground; moderately juicy, rich, very mild subacid,\r\nwith a mixture of sweet. Growth slow; late autumnal and early winter.\r\nHowever, it ripens earlier in this climate; follows the Maiden's Blush.\r\nDowning says no orchard is complete without it.\r\n\r\nWhile the Ben Davis, Missouri Pippin and Mother are my favorites for\r\nproductiveness, we have other varieties that are quite productive and\r\nlong-lived trees, such as the Early Margaret or Striped June, that is an\r\nannual and profuse bearer and one of our earliest. Duchess of Oldenburg\r\nhas never failed with me. Maiden's Blush has given good success. We have\r\nthe Romanite, Rawle's Janet and Limber Twig that are good keepers, but\r\nowing to size are not desirable for home use or market. I find more\r\ncomplaint of the Ben Davis than any other apple, though its beauty\r\ninvariably causes it to sell. My greatest mistake in planting was in\r\nselecting Rhode Island Greening and Nonsuch, which have proven almost\r\nnon-bearers. The trees are healthy and grow almost like an elm or oak. A\r\nnumber of varieties, such as the Mammoth Black Twig, Arkansas Black,\r\nMuklen, Rome Beauty, I have not fruited, and cannot tell as to their\r\nqualities in this locality. In all my experience in the apple line I\r\nfind that no orchard will grow and bear without attention, and constant\r\nattention at that. The apple tree requires as much interest from its\r\nowner as cattle do from the stock-raiser. From a tiny seed, it is\r\nsubject to disease and pests which, if not destroyed, will destroy it. I\r\nwould say in conclusion that success in apple raising comes only through\r\neternal vigilance.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD CULTURE.\r\n\r\n     By JAMES McNICOL, Lost Springs, Marion county, Kansas.\r\n\r\nOrchard culture being my subject, of course the varieties of trees are\r\nsupposed to be carefully selected and planted; but the distance apart is\r\nimportant. If too close, no matter how thorough the cultivation, they\r\nwill suffer for moisture; and if too wide apart the winds will play\r\nhavoc with the trees and fruit. What is best for this locality, to break\r\nthe prevailing south winds and yet have plenty of space for the roots to\r\nfind moisture? Is it better to plant closely north and south or east and\r\nwest? I would prefer close rows running east and west, as each row would\r\nhelp break the wind when the trees in the row reached each other--then\r\nhow close in the row and how far apart the rows? I would plant the trees\r\ntwenty feet apart in the rows and the rows thirty feet apart. I would\r\nlike to recommend planting a row of cherry, dwarf pear, plum or peach\r\nbetween each apple row, provided they are cut out when they rob each\r\nother of moisture.\r\n\r\nEternal vigilance is the price of fruit, but, in central Kansas, to\r\neternal vigilance you must add thorough cultivation. For a few years\r\ncultivated crops may be grown, leaving a good space next to the trees to\r\nbe cultivated--not to grow up in weeds. Do not, like one of my\r\nneighbors, cultivate the corn row, that cost only about five cents a row\r\nfor seed, four times, and leave the tree row, which cost two dollars per\r\nrow, uncultivated. Do not use a stirring plow; it will hill up earth\r\naround the trees too much. With a lister you can list in your corn or\r\nfurrow out potato rows, running east and west one year, and north and\r\nsouth the next. Growing crops for five or six years is long enough; then\r\ncultivation should be done with a disc, an Acme or a common harrow; I\r\nprefer a reversible disc. Acme is all right if you do not let the weeds\r\nget the start of you (which you should never do, but you will\r\nsometimes); then the disc is the implement.\r\n\r\nWhatever tool you use keep it a going, east, west, and diagonal, and\r\nwhen blessed with a good rain through the summer don't wait till the\r\nweeds get started, but cultivate as soon as dry enough to form a dust\r\nmulch. Few seem to know the value of a dust mulch. A high state of\r\ncultivation can be kept up in the orchard with what implements the\r\nfarmer has. Use the one-horse, five-tooth cultivator close to the trees,\r\nand the two-horse cultivator for the middle, going both ways; then\r\npulverize with the harrow; use the harrow often. Six days' work at the\r\nproper time will keep a five-acre orchard in good shape the whole\r\nseason. \"But,\" says some one, \"it doesn't pay; this is not a fruit\r\ncountry.\" No, it is no fruit country, and never will be, to the one who\r\nhas no time to cultivate; but to the one that will there is a big\r\nreward, for the very reason that it is not a fruit country.\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARD TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n     A paper read before the Kansas Horticultural Society, by W. D.\r\n     CELLAR, of Edwardsville, Kan.\r\n\r\nA wide difference of opinion prevails as to the proper distance apart\r\nfor apple trees, some growers maintaining that forty feet is close\r\nenough, while others plant as close as fifteen feet. With varieties that\r\ncome into bearing early, planting close in the row north and south, with\r\nthe intention of cutting out every other tree when they are large enough\r\nto crowd, may be good husbandry. Two or three crops might be secured\r\nbefore it would be necessary to cut out the extra trees. The objections\r\nare, that the orchard cannot be so thoroughly cultivated, and the drain\r\nnecessary to grow the extra trees might so debilitate the soil as to\r\nseriously affect succeeding crops. One grower says: \"I am satisfied it\r\nwill pay in the short run, but it remains to be seen whether it will pay\r\nin the long run.\" In this section, where we have so much wind and\r\nsunshine, twenty-five to thirty feet seems to be the proper distance for\r\napple trees, fifteen feet for plums, and fifteen by twenty feet for\r\npeach and cherry, and twenty feet for pear trees. Upland is thought\r\nbetter than river bottom for orchards, and a north or east slope is\r\nchosen for apples.\r\n\r\nA difference in location is required for different varieties of apples.\r\nA vigorous-growing variety will do well on the thin soil of the hills,\r\nwhile a variety deficient in root vigor, which might be profitable in\r\ndeep soil, would not thrive on the hilltops. I gathered this year from\r\neight-year-old Missouri Pippin trees, planted in the deep soil of a\r\ncreek bottom, five bushels of apples to the tree, while Missouri Pippins\r\nin the same orchard, on the hilltops, planted at the same time and\r\nhaving the same treatment, yielded scarcely a bushel to the tree. In the\r\nsame orchard Jonathans yielded about as well on the hill as in the\r\nvalley. I would not choose an exposed north or northwest slope for\r\npeaches or cherries. Better an east, or even a south slope. Professor\r\nWhitten, of the Missouri State Agricultural College, has recommended\r\nwhitening peach trees in winter by spraying with lime to prevent\r\npremature swelling of the buds.\r\n\r\nIn my locality the best varieties of apples, from a commercial\r\nstandpoint, are Ben Davis, Jonathan, and Missouri Pippin. More Kieffer\r\nand Duchess pears are planted than any other kind. The leading peaches\r\nare Elberta, Old Mixon Free, Stump, Champion, Smock, and Salway. The\r\nmost profitable plum is the Wild Goose. Some of the Japans, Abundance\r\nand Burbank promise well. Of cherries, Dyehouse, Early Richmond,\r\nMontmorency, English Morello and Ostheim make a succession in the order\r\nnamed, and are the best for either a family or commercial orchard.\r\n\r\nCultivation of the orchard for the first few years is deemed absolutely\r\nnecessary to success, but it is a serious problem how to cultivate the\r\nhills, and at the same time keep them from washing into the hollows and\r\nso denuding the roots of the trees at the top. I know one orchard in\r\nwhich a back furrow has been thrown to each tree row in the same\r\ndirection for several years, leaving a dead furrow (which has become a\r\nditch) between the rows. It looks like a field of huge sweet-potato\r\nrows, with the trees standing on tripods or \"quadrapeds\" at the top of\r\nthe ridges. Neither back furrow nor dead furrow should be made in the\r\ntree row. As few dead furrows as possible should be left. They should be\r\nfrequently changed, and should never run up and down the hill. If\r\nditches have started, they cannot be stopped by plowing them full of\r\nearth; the loose soil will wash out at the first rain. Fill them with\r\nold hay, straw, stalks, or brush. Old raspberry or blackberry canes are\r\nexcellent for this purpose. Begin at the bottom and work up the hill,\r\nletting the forkfuls overlap like shingles. Drive a stake through at\r\nfrequent intervals, and secure firmly at the top; else a hard freshet\r\nwill wash it all out. Deep ditches may be filled by dams of loose stone\r\na rod or two apart. On many farms these stones need to be gathered\r\nanyway, and one may \"kill two birds with one stone\" by filling a big\r\nditch with a good many stones. \"An ounce of prevention, however, is\r\nworth a pound of cure,\" and the best prevention from washing that I know\r\nof is clover. I would advise seeding a hill orchard as soon as the trees\r\nhave had a year or two of vigorous growth. The orchard may be cultivated\r\nafter the spring rains, and seeded again in time to prevent washing the\r\nnext winter. After the orchard is seven or eight years old, I should\r\nleave it in clover and weeds, mowing two or three times a year to make a\r\nmulch and prevent tall growth of weeds.\r\n\r\n\"Hogs in the orchard\" is generally condemned. I have seen old orchards,\r\nhowever, that were decidedly benefited by hogs. Hogs and plums go\r\ntogether. This is no theory, but an established fact. Let them rub the\r\ntrees as much as they will; let them tramp the ground till it is as bare\r\nand as hard as the road. It will do no harm; it will do good. Hogs may\r\nnot like green apples, but there is something specially delectable to a\r\nhog in a green, wormy plum. He will pick up every one that drops, and so\r\ndiminish the crop of curculio. In my locality, pruning of apple and\r\ncherry orchards is practiced very sparingly. Cutting out broken, decayed\r\nand interlacing branches and the suckers at the base seems to be about\r\nall the pruning that is desirable. Peach and plum orchards are likewise\r\nneglected, though some growers practice heading in to make the trees\r\ngrow more compact, and to thin the fruit. I think that, with tall and\r\nstraggling apple trees, such as Missouri Pippin, Winesap, or Minkler,\r\nheading in might be profitably practiced.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the profit of spraying for insects and fungi, as far\r\nas my observation goes, is not settled yet. The theory is all\r\nright--indeed, it has become one of the strongest articles of faith in\r\nthe horticulturist's creed. When the subject comes up in the\r\nhorticultural meeting all commend it. Very few growers, however, make a\r\nbusiness of spraying. Most of the growers in my locality who used to\r\nspray have quit it. They deny that they have lost faith in it, but they\r\ndon't do it. My opinion, based not on my own experience, but the\r\npractice--or rather lack of practice--of others, is that, save in\r\nexceptional cases, it doesn't pay; that the ravages of codling-moth and\r\ncurculio are not appreciably lessened by spraying; that the loss from\r\nscab in this dry climate is so light as not to justify the cost of\r\nspraying; that, just as many of the doctrines of the churchmen would\r\ndie out if the preachers should turn teachers, so the doctrine of\r\nspraying as a cure-all would die out if the pump men and experimenters\r\nshould turn fruit-growers; that the average man believes in a\r\nperfunctory way many things which his experience forbids him to\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe damage from borers is a serious drawback to orcharding. There are\r\nvarious patent contrivances and washes that are recommended to prevent\r\nthe work of borers, but all, so far as my observation goes, fall short\r\nof complete success. The only safe way is to hunt the borers out. This\r\nshould be done twice a year, late in August, when the newly hatched ones\r\nare large enough to be easily seen, and in April or May, after they have\r\ncome up out of the roots, to get the ones overlooked in the fall.\r\n\r\nRabbits the past year have been specially troublesome. In my locality\r\nthey frequently attack large trees, six to ten inches in diameter, and,\r\nin some instances, entirely destroy them. Their mischief for the most\r\npart, however, is confined to young orchards, and may be prevented by\r\nwrapping the trees with grass, stalks, paper, or, better than anything\r\nelse, wooden wrappers made especially for the purpose. These wrappers\r\nare now manufactured in Kansas City. They cost about one-third of a cent\r\neach, are easily put on, and last four or five years. They are said to\r\nprotect the tree from sun-scald and borer also, but I would not rely on\r\nthem as a protection from borers, but would remove them and hunt the\r\nborers at least once a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKING AND PACKING.\r\n\r\n     Description of sorting table used by D. S. HAINES, Edwardsville,\r\n     Wyandotte county, Kansas.\r\n\r\nOur packing-house is on hilly land, and it is considerable trouble to\r\nhaul apples to it. My packer now sorts and packs right in the orchard,\r\nusing a sorting table. This table stands say three feet high and ten\r\nfeet long, and three and one-half feet wide, with a common six-inch\r\nboard on edge on the side. The men in picking use a ladder twelve to\r\neighteen feet long. We did wrong in making our ladders; we could have\r\nbought them already made that were lighter and just the right thing. We\r\nset this sorting table among the trees; the men fill their sacks,\r\nemptying them on this table, which is carpeted; they barrel the apples\r\nup beside this table by letting them through an opening into a barrel.\r\nAn apron is so arranged as to let the apples fall on it, and gently roll\r\ninto the barrel without bruising. A man heads the barrels as soon as\r\npacked. In packing apples in the field we found that something solid was\r\nneeded upon which to shake the barrels. The man who fills the barrels\r\nshakes them to make them more solid; then when pressed they bruise less.\r\nOur man can head about 100 barrels a day. In our rough country it is a\r\ngreat advantage to sort and pack in the orchard. We move this table\r\nabout in the orchard. The expense to pick and pack a barrel of apples is\r\nabout twenty cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PICKING SACK.\r\n\r\n     Description of one used by FRED WELLHOUSE.\r\n\r\nWe usually pick two rows of apples at a time, using gangs of twelve men\r\nwith a foreman. We cannot use more to advantage. Each man has a common\r\ngrain sack with a leather fastened to the bottom, as used in sowing\r\ngrain. These picking sacks are made by taking a strong two-bushel grain\r\nsack. Sew a leather strap six inches long and four inches wide to a\r\nbottom corner of the sack. On the loose end of this strap fasten a\r\nstrong metallic hook. To the upper corner on same side of sack fasten a\r\nstrong metallic ring or link. Opposite this ring fasten with rivets a\r\npiece of iron six or eight inches long and about half an inch wide and\r\none-eighth an inch thick, rounded, across the sack mouth at the edge to\r\nhold the sack open. This sack is worn under the left arm, the strap\r\ngoing over the right shoulder and hooking in front. We use ladders from\r\ntwelve to sixteen feet long. The top of the ladder is made narrow so it\r\ncan be put between the limbs, being just wide enough at top to set one\r\nfoot on at a time. The apples are picked and put in bushel boxes on a\r\nplatform on a wagon. The boxes are sixteen inches wide, twenty-four\r\ninches long, and eight inches deep, holding about a bushel, sixteen to a\r\nwagon.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISCUSSION ON PACKAGES.\r\n\r\nEdwin Snyder, Jefferson county: I want to say something about marking\r\npackages. I had a nice crop of Jonathan apples; expert men barreled them\r\nfor me, and put my address on the end of the barrel, outside. The\r\ncommission man just took his little knife and raked it [the address]\r\noff. It is policy to put your name on [packages] if going to a\r\nwholesaler, but not to a commission house. I know economy pays in\r\nhandling fruits, from packing to marketing. I should think boxes better\r\n[than barrels]. We have had trouble with barrel hoops breaking. I do not\r\nbelieve it best to sort too closely. If you put first-class apples on\r\ntop, and second-class on the bottom, your customers expect to find the\r\nbest on top and worst on bottom.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: I have been in Kansas City, and never saw a name scratched\r\noff a barrel yet. In grading strawberries, give each picker six boxes in\r\na tray; have them fill three with large berries and three with medium\r\nsize [impracticable]; allow no inferior or small ones put in.\r\n\r\nA Member: About fifty per cent. of our fruit, especially apples, is not\r\nreadily marketed. Can we possibly handle this fifty per cent. so as to\r\nmake it pay the expense of handling the better part of the fruit?\r\n\r\nEdwin Taylor: If the culls are fifty per cent. of the crop, it is not\r\ndifficult to make them pay for handling the entire crop. This year the\r\nculls would readily sell at fifteen cents in the orchard. Last year\r\nthere was no trouble to sell \"down apples\" for ten cents in the orchard.\r\nThe cost of packing is slightly more or less than fifteen cents a\r\nbarrel. If your apples are scattered, more; if near together, less.\r\n\r\nDr. G. Bohrer: Would it not pay better to work them [the culls] into\r\ncider and vinegar?\r\n\r\nEdwin Taylor: No, sir. I had rather they would rot on the ground than be\r\nmade into cider.\r\n\r\nA Member: Our second grade brought forty cents a crate; the best, sixty\r\ncents. It pays me best to mix them. I ship to Kansas City, and they\r\nhandle my fruit with success.\r\n\r\nH. L. Ferris: This year I sent a Minnesota man a car load of very small\r\nWinesap and Missouri Pippin apples, such as we use for making cider, in\r\nexchange for potatoes. I sold part of the potatoes at seventy-five cents\r\nand eighty cents, and some are in the cellar.\r\n\r\nGeo. Van Houten: In our state [Iowa] we are most successful in handling\r\napples in barrels. For a small trade, bushel boxes made of light\r\nmaterial may serve better. Many car-loads are sent out in eight-pound\r\nbaskets.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOGS IN THE ORCHARD.\r\n\r\nQuestion: _Does swine grazing injure orchards?_\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: Not if the hogs are kept out of it. It is death to an\r\norchard to let hogs in. To let them rub against the trees closes the\r\npores, and growth ceases. We notice in the newspapers that fish oil,\r\naxle grease, etc., keep off rabbits. I tried using axle grease two\r\nyears. You could see the mark around where the oil had been, and note\r\nwhere growth had stopped below this mark. By washing this with soap, we\r\nwere enabled to get the trees to grow again. Hogs, as I stated before,\r\nwill, by rubbing, close the pores. The tramping hardens the soil and\r\nshuts out any percolation of water into it. As well plant a tree in the\r\nmiddle of the road as where hogs have been. They, of all animals, tramp\r\nthe ground the hardest.\r\n\r\nSamuel Reynolds: Would pigs injure the soil?\r\n\r\nT. A. Stanley: I have had experience in this, yet, while I do not know\r\nanything about the gentleman's land packing, I believe it benefits some\r\norchards to run hogs in them. I tried it on an orchard that had ceased\r\nbearing. I inclosed the orchard and put hogs in for a year or more. New\r\ngrowth started on the trees, and they at once began to bear, and bore\r\nfor several years after I took the hogs out. I could see no injury\r\ncaused by their rubbing the trees. I do not think they will rub the\r\ntrees if the orchard is large. I do not see what injury they do. After\r\nthe apples grew large enough, if wormy they fell, and the hogs ate the\r\napples and the worms also.\r\n\r\nEdwin Taylor: I have had a little experience in that line. I fenced\r\naround a twenty-acre orchard, expecting to combine horticulture and\r\nagriculture right there. My hogs were lousy, and they did rub the trees,\r\nand whenever they rub they destroy. Anybody who tries it will find they\r\nwill absolutely squeal for something to eat when there are bushels of\r\napples on the ground. I was at large expense to fence, but was so\r\ndisappointed with the hog business that I took the fence down.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLD STORAGE.\r\n\r\n     By GEO. RICHARDSON, of Leavenworth, Kan.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that \"Necessity is the mother of invention.\" Cold\r\nstorage of the present time is understood as \"mechanical refrigeration,\"\r\nand in general, the preservation of perishable articles by means of low\r\ntemperature, hence, the act of reducing the temperature of any body, or\r\nmaintaining the same below the temperature of the atmosphere, is called\r\nrefrigeration, or more familiarly known as cold storage, produced by the\r\nemployment of machinery of various types. Of those mostly in use, are\r\nthe compression system, using anhydrous ammonia as a refrigerant, by\r\nexpanding the ammonia either directly through coils of pipe arranged in\r\nthe storage rooms, or through coils of pipe that are submerged in salt\r\nbrine, where the brine is reduced to a low temperature and then forced\r\nand circulated through pipes in the storage rooms, one being known as\r\ndirect expansion, the other, brine circulation, but both accomplish same\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nTo utilize anhydrous ammonia requires complicated and expensive\r\nmachinery, and to those not acquainted with the subject it may seem\r\nstrange that more units of heat are produced by the burning of coal,\r\nwood or oil than there are units of cold produced to reduce the\r\ntemperature of storage rooms.\r\n\r\nOf the uses and benefits of cold storage it can be truthfully stated,\r\nthat nothing in recent years has been of more direct benefit to the\r\nfarmer, stock-raiser, and fruit-grower. But a brief period has passed\r\nsince cellars, caves and underground grottos served as the best means,\r\nand in a limited way under certain conditions of weather, for the\r\nprotection and preservation of perishable articles.\r\n\r\nTo-day machinery has made it possible to control temperature at any\r\ndegree and in all climates. The burning heat under the equator would not\r\nbe an impediment to secure a zero temperature in a cold-storage room.\r\n\r\nThe construction and successful operation of the mammoth packing-houses\r\nare the outgrowth of the success of the application of mechanical\r\nrefrigeration, where any day of the year a market is made for live\r\nstock. But few years have elapsed since the vast herds of South American\r\ncattle had no value, except for their hides, horns, and tallow, and the\r\ngreat bands of Australian sheep for their wool. Now immense\r\nrefrigerating plants are in operation, freezing the beef and mutton,\r\nwith fleets of ocean steamers equipped with refrigerating machinery and\r\nstorage rooms filled with frozen meat for European markets. From the\r\nUnited States the dressed-beef traffic is of large proportions. Storage\r\nspeculators are always ready buyers at remunerative prices for butter\r\nand eggs, that in value exceed the great wheat crop of America.\r\n\r\nTo fruit-growers, especially those engaged in apple culture, cold\r\nstorage is attracting more than common interest, as it has been\r\ndemonstrated a grand success in the preservation of apples from three to\r\nsix months longer, in good condition, than in natural storage that is\r\nsubject to the changeable influences of the atmosphere. At the same\r\ntime, the apples retain their original and individual flavor, color, and\r\ncrispness.\r\n\r\nCold storage, or mechanical refrigeration, arrests fermentation and\r\ndecay, or, better stated, prolongs the life and keeping qualities.\r\n\r\nOf the advantages gained, it offers a place of safe-keeping for future\r\nmarket, and affords a protection for the grower if market conditions are\r\nnot favorable; such as an overstocked market, consequently low prices,\r\ncaused largely and influenced by many other varieties of fruit that are\r\nin season while the apple crop is being gathered.\r\n\r\nAgain, the fact of the existence of cold-storage houses has brought into\r\nthe field speculators, which has a wholesome influence, and oftentimes\r\nstrengthens the markets and lessens the quantity that would of necessity\r\nbe forced on sale at an earlier period at a great sacrifice, which is\r\nthe situation this year, where the enormous crops of New York, New\r\nEngland and Michigan apples are being sold at from fifty to seventy-five\r\ncents a barrel (including barrels) placed aboard cars, for the want of\r\nproper and sufficient storage facilities to relieve part of the burden.\r\nNo such condition or low price has yet been felt by the Western grower.\r\n\r\nThere may be years when the buyers will look far into the future and\r\nthink they can see visions of long prices, when it would be wise for the\r\ngrowers to sell, as there is some risk to be taken as to future markets\r\nbeing lower than prices in the fall, but such is not the rule.\r\n\r\nFrom six years' experience with mechanical refrigeration and the storage\r\nof Western-grown apples, there has not been a year but what a profit has\r\nbeen shown over and above the cost of storage, insurance, and minor\r\nincidental charges. One of the first to make the experiment, and who\r\nhave been patrons of Ryan & Richardson's cold storage, at Leavenworth,\r\nsince the plant was erected, were Wellhouse & Son, the largest apple\r\ngrowers in the United States, and the records show a net profit of from\r\nfifty cents a barrel, as the lowest of any year, to as high as $1.50\r\nother years. It is gratifying to state that, in all the years, not a\r\nsingle car-load was rejected when sold. Much of the success must be\r\ngiven credit to the grower who gathers his crop at the right time, in a\r\ncareful manner, graded and packed according to the requirements of the\r\ntrade. Then, if the cold storage to which he intrusts the care of his\r\ncrop uses the same watchfulness as to necessary temperature, proper\r\nventilation at the right time, the result usually will be gratifying and\r\nremunerative to both.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FRUIT DRYER.\r\n\r\nThe dryers used by Wellhouse & Son are made as follows: A rough building\r\neighteen feet square and sixteen feet to the eaves is built. In building\r\nthe roof, a lantern or ventilator is built along the ridge, over an\r\nopening in the ridge two feet wide. At eight feet from the ground is\r\nbuilt a slatted floor. The timbers [?] upon which this floor is laid are\r\nbest made of one-inch boards, ten to twelve inches wide, placed only ten\r\nor twelve inches apart. The floor slats are best made of poplar, as pine\r\noften flavors the fruit. They are sawn from inch lumber one and one-half\r\ninches on one face and one and one-quarter inches on the other face. The\r\nslats are nailed to the floor joists [?] with the wide faces uppermost\r\nand about one eighth to three-sixteenths of an inch apart, thus making\r\nthe crevices wider below, which, together with the narrowness of the\r\nfloor joists [?], allows free circulation and prevents clogging. The\r\nlower floor is of earth, cinders, stone, or other material. On each\r\nside, near the ground, are two openings, each two feet square, with\r\nshutters to close them; these are to admit fresh air, and can be closed\r\nto regulate draft. A chimney is built up through the center of the\r\nbuilding, out through the roof. A door is made to each floor; in front\r\nof the upper door is built a balcony reached by outside stairs. This\r\ncompletes the dryer.\r\n\r\nIt may be used for storing hay, fodder, tools, etc., after the drying\r\nseason is over. The upper floor might be made removable. Many farmers\r\nhave a suitable building if the slatted floor is added. Any kind of a\r\nwood or coal stove (or a brick furnace) is placed in the lower room and\r\na good heat kept up; maximum 150 degrees. The prepared fruit is simply\r\nspread evenly upon the slatted floor from four to twelve inches deep.\r\nFire must be continuous, and a dryer eighteen feet square will dry 100\r\nbushels in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBleaching is done as follows: An upright box about two feet square and\r\ntwelve feet long is built outside against the balcony. A set of trays\r\nare made to fit it; these trays have bottoms of galvanized-wire\r\nscreening. A pot of sulphur is kept burning on the ground under the\r\ncenter of said box, the apples, peeled and cored, are placed in the tray\r\nand the tray slid in above the sulphur. An endless chain mechanism moves\r\nthe tray up ten to twelve inches and another goes in; as they come to\r\nthe top an employee removes them and runs the fruit through a slicer and\r\nthen spreads it out on the drying floor. In twenty-four hours the\r\nproduct will be dry, but not alike; they are then piled up under cover,\r\nand pass through a sweat, making them alike throughout. As soon as cool\r\nthey are packed, and pressed into boxes for shipment. This dryer costs\r\nbut little, and the building may be used eight to ten months of the year\r\nfor any cleanly purpose. President Wellhouse has six of these dryers in\r\na row in one of his orchards. A single bleacher answers for several\r\ndryers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOYER FRUIT EVAPORATOR.\r\n\r\nBill of lumber for dry-house: Four pieces 2x4, 10 feet long; flooring,\r\n150 feet; 1x1 strips, for trays, 400 feet, lineal measure; 1x2, 47 feet,\r\nlineal measure; 1x4, for tray rest in center, 47 feet, lineal measure.\r\n\r\nHow to build and operate: For the house or box part, take four pieces of\r\n2x4, 56 inches long, and four pieces 2x4, 37-1/2 inches long; nail\r\ntogether with the short pieces on the inside, lapping the long ones on\r\nthe end of the shorter--thus making a frame 52x37-1/2 on the inside.\r\nThis makes the sills and plates. Close three sides of this with matched\r\nflooring, up and down, seven feet high; now you have a box seven feet\r\nhigh, 52x37-1/2 inches. Leave the one side open to be closed with four\r\ndoors similar to double stable doors, and in the exact center of this\r\ndoor space nail a 1x2 inch piece up and down to nail tray rest to. This\r\nwill give two rows of trays.\r\n\r\nPut comb roof on with the flooring, leaving a vent open at comb two\r\ninches the entire length of box. Make a V trough, which turn upside down\r\nwith one inch blocks under the corners; this gives ventilation and also\r\nkeeps out the rain; also make two six-inch holes below, to be opened or\r\nclosed as needed; this admits cold air and drives the hot air up,\r\ncausing complete draft. When the evaporator is full of fruit, the holes\r\nbelow should be open full size, except at night, when fruit is nearly\r\ndried, they should be closed, or partly so, which is done by tacking a\r\nsmall piece of board over hole, which can be pushed to one side and a\r\nnail or screw hold it in place. For the trays to rest on, take a piece\r\n1x4, 37-1/2 inches long, nail a two-inch piece of same length in center\r\nof this, on top; this gives one inch on each side for rabbet; this is\r\nfor center, and the rabbet rest is nailed to it through the 1x2 inch in\r\nfront, and through the siding on rear side. For the outside rabbet, one\r\npiece 1x1 inch, 37-1/2 long; this nailed to the end of the box forms\r\nrabbet for the trays to rest on. As many of these tray rests can be made\r\nas needed to fill the box to near the top of doors. Place the first ones\r\ntwelve inches from bottom of box, and continue up, placing them three\r\nand one-half inches apart. The trays are made of 1x1 inch strips for the\r\nframe part, and are 2x3 feet square; bottom is made of plastering lath\r\nsawed in two, and also cut in two lengthwise, as they are too wide; nail\r\nthese to bottom of frame, three-sixteenths of an inch apart. When used\r\nfor berries or sweet corn, tack cheese cloth stretched tightly over the\r\nlath. There should be four doors, in order to have as small a space open\r\nas possible in attending to the fruit; these are hung by light hinges to\r\noutside and fastened by a wooden button screwed to center upright. The\r\nlumber can all be bought at planer ready for use cheaper than it can be\r\ncut by hand.\r\n\r\nFor the furnace, build a box of brick or stone as large on the inside as\r\nthe house, letting the most of the wall extend on the outside, in order\r\nto have all the space possible inside, for heating. Build into this wall\r\nat the bottom and ends a piece of heavy stack or sheet iron; any old\r\nsmoke-stack will do, but must be at least one foot in diameter: if\r\nsmoke-stack is used, split it and spread as much as possible, to have\r\nlarge enough place for fire and all the heating surface possible. This\r\nopen edge of iron must be well plastered down with mortar, or brick and\r\nmortar, that no smoke may get inside. Let it extend just through the\r\nwall to a flue built at the end on the outside, of brick or stone, as\r\nhigh or a little higher than the wall; then a common six-inch stovepipe\r\nset on, to run as high as the evaporator, will do. A damper in pipe is\r\nan advantage to check draft and control heat, and pipe should be at\r\nleast one foot from evaporator.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of furnace should be at same end as the ventilator holes in\r\nthe evaporator, and can be closed by a piece of sheet iron with a small\r\ndraft underneath, the same as a stove door.\r\n\r\nSet your box evaporator on this wall, and mud or plaster it down tight.\r\nIn using, always have your house well heated before putting in fruit.\r\nThe top of wall must be fully one foot above top of iron; this will make\r\ntwo feet space from iron to first tray. In putting the trays in, shove\r\nthe first one clear back, let second be flush in front, the third clear\r\nback again--placing them the same in both sides; this sends the heated\r\nair directly over each tray to the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MISSOURI APPLE HOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe property of Col. J. C. Evans, Harlem, Mo., president of Missouri\r\nState Horticultural Society. Dimensions: Length, 200 feet; width, 46\r\nfeet; depth, 11 feet; earth bank, 5-1/2 feet thick. Capacity, 15,000\r\nbarrels. Cost, $1,000 and eighty-five loads of sawdust. Double floor\r\noverhead, with eight inches of sawdust between. Roof projects three feet\r\nall round. Ground slopes away rapidly, to carry away water. Winter\r\nentrance through anteroom 12x12. Driveway twelve feet wide through whole\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANY WAYS OF USING CULL APPLES.\r\n\r\nCider: Newly made sweet cider is both pleasant and healthful, and is a\r\nuseful ingredient in some culinary preparations; but it should be used\r\nfresh from the press or not more than twenty-four hours old. To make it,\r\ncut out all the rotten and bruised spots, also the worms and their\r\nburrows. To make cider or vinegar from rotten and wormy apples ought to\r\nbe considered a crime. The famous Russet cider of New York is made from\r\nsound Russet apples and brings top price.\r\n\r\nSweet cider may be canned or bottled and will keep interminably, if\r\nheated to 160 degrees and kept hot for twenty minutes, then canned and\r\nsealed as for fruit.\r\n\r\nBoiled cider, that is, reduced to one-fifth by boiling, and canned, is a\r\nnice article for culinary use, for making apple-butter, apple-sauce and\r\nin apple or mince pies. It would sell.\r\n\r\nCider vinegar is the best for home use and market. No one having an\r\napple orchard should ever buy vinegar, and ought to have some to sell to\r\nneighbors or at the stores. To make: Sweet cider carefully made should\r\nbe placed in clean, sweet, oak barrels, placed in a room where sun and\r\nfrost cannot reach it. The barrels should be laid on their sides, with\r\nthe open bung-hole upward, and double mosquito net or wire tacked over\r\nit. It requires from eighteen months to two years to become first class,\r\nbut there is no more labor excepting to rack or siphon it off from the\r\nsediment; do not be impatient; make some every year, and if you are a\r\n\"rustler\" you will make good money out of it. Our home demand requires\r\nover 50,000 barrels per month.\r\n\r\nApple-butter, to be good, requires boiled cider, and if to the boiled\r\ncider is added the good parts of the best culls, and carefully and\r\nskilfully boiled, either with or without spices, it sells for one dollar\r\nper gallon and is very profitable.\r\n\r\nDried apples: The best of the culls, carefully trimmed, peeled, cored,\r\nand quartered or sliced, may be dried in the sun and air anywhere in\r\nKansas. A cheap rack of poles or slats three or four feet above the\r\nground, a lot of trays made of lath with muslin bottoms and plenty of\r\nmosquito netting to spread on hoops or bars above the fruit to keep off\r\nflies, are all that is needed. Do not leave them spread out during rain,\r\nor at night. The trays can be piled at night, with the fruit in them,\r\nunder a shed or cover. Keep all vermin from them and stir often.\r\n\r\nEvaporated apples sell better, and by many are preferred. [I like the\r\nsun-kissed ones the best.--Sec.] There are numerous patent evaporators,\r\nall very good; but any ingenious man can make his own. The evaporators\r\nin which the Wellhouse culls are dried are very simple. President\r\nWellhouse says he spent over $2,500 on patent dryers without any\r\nsatisfaction, and then built his own, which are described elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENEMIES OF THE APPLE.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] We are pleased to acknowledge our obligations for much of the\r\nfollowing valuable information on our insect enemies and for the loan of\r\ncuts used to Prof. J. M. Stedman, of Columbia College, Mo., and Prof. E.\r\nE. Faville, of the Kansas Agricultural College.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE-WORMS.\r\n\r\nMany believe that worms are the parents of worms, and that they come\r\nsuddenly, like a \"wolf on the fold.\" A letter is received at this office\r\ntelling of the sudden appearance in immense numbers of a worm that is\r\ndestroying all that is before it, and wondering where they came from \"so\r\nsuddenly.\" Speaking of apple pests, the canker-worm, tent-caterpillar,\r\nthe worm (larva) of the handmaid-moth, and the apple-worm (larva of the\r\ncodling-moth), they did not come (travel) from anywhere; and no\r\ndifference if they cover your trees, or are like the \"sands on the\r\nseashore,\" they were all hatched right there on your trees.\r\n\r\nAn observer looks at an apple or a nut with a hole in it, and says,\r\n\"There is where the worm went in.\" It is directly the opposite; that is\r\nwhere the worm went out. He hatched from an egg, placed on, near by or\r\njust under the surface of the fruit; and eating a burrow to the core it\r\ngrew large and plump, became a full-grown worm, burrowed to the surface,\r\nand passed out. When you see worms hanging in great numbers from single\r\nwebs or the bole of your tree alive, with myriads of worms crawling,\r\nsome up, some down, some crosswise, know of a surety that they are not\r\ngoing _up_, but coming _down_ to Mother Earth. Insect life changes more\r\nin a day than humanity does in a year. These worms have quit feeding,\r\nand are in a nervous, uneasy, often blind and skin-tight condition,\r\ngoing through a change from the luxury of leaf or fruit eating to a\r\ndesire and ability to burrow into a living tomb several inches below the\r\nearth's surface. These myriads of worms are doing you no harm now; they\r\nwill never eat again, no matter how tempting the morsel. This shows the\r\nabsurdity of bands of cotton, etc., placed about a tree when the bole is\r\ncovered with worms, \"to keep them from going up.\"\r\n\r\nThe real parents, the ones that lay the eggs and propagate their\r\nspecies, are usually winged moths or butterflies. A beautiful moth that\r\nyou admire and will not allow your child to hurt may be the parent of\r\nthe disgusting and destructive worms covering your trees or shrubs. In\r\nthe following pages, we have tried in the least and simplest language to\r\ndescribe our commonest and most objectionable apple pests.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING CANKER-WORM.\r\n\r\nThis is the worm that the amateur and the very busy man suddenly\r\ndiscovers in April defoliating his apple trees, and, on examination, he\r\nfinds them in such myriads that he imagines some power has suddenly sown\r\nthem broadcast over his orchard. See fig. 1. Had he been observant\r\nduring the sunny middays of February, he would have noticed insects\r\nsimilar to figure 2 crawling up the bole of the tree, and looking closer,\r\na little later, he would see small masses of eggs, shown in figures\r\n3 _a_ and _b_, glued fast, usually near the base of limbs or twigs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. Adult Female.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. _a_, Eggs deposited at base of limb. _b_,\r\nEgg mass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. _a_, Larva, or worm. _b_, Cluster, and\r\na magnified egg.]\r\n\r\nAlong early in April these eggs, warmed by the same sun that swells the\r\nbuds and causes the green tips of the leaves to protrude, hatch into\r\ntiny worms looking like a dark thread snipped into bits about an eighth\r\nof an inch long. These millions of tiny worms, scarcely visible, occupy\r\ntheir time eating and growing, and the orchardist is possibly unaware of\r\nthe army he is feeding until they grow into lusty, fat worms, from one\r\nand one-eighth to one and one-fourth inches long, of a dark olive-green\r\ncolor, with black heads. See _a_, fig. 4. If disturbed they quickly spin\r\na single web and fall suspended at its end, as in fig. 1. Their life, as\r\nworms, lasts only about six weeks, then they seem suddenly to have\r\nvanished. They have gone into the earth to pass into the pupa state,\r\ncoming out the following spring as adults; the males with wings to fly,\r\nthe female wingless, as in fig. 2, to crawl up the tree as described.\r\nNow, as these myriads of tiny worms must make the tons of grown worms\r\nentirely from the foliage on the trees in which they hatched, it is\r\nplain that the said foliage must suffer, and it will look as if scorched\r\nby fire.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ Bands smeared with sticky material put tightly around the\r\ntree bole early in February has stopped many a female from crawling up\r\nto lay her eggs. Spraying with London purple or Paris green, one pound\r\nwith two pounds of lime and 150 gallons of water, is the common remedy.\r\nTo be efficacious the drug must be of a normal strength, say forty-five\r\nper cent. arsenic, and as the worms grow larger and stronger the water\r\nmust be lessened. When the worms are an inch or more long it may require\r\nonly fifty gallons of water. Another formula is, two pounds white\r\narsenic, four pounds sal soda, two gallons of water; boil until the\r\narsenic is dissolved. One pint is enough for forty gallons of water. As\r\nthe worms usually feed on the under side of the leaves, spraying should\r\nbe from below as much as possible. \"The early bird catches the worm\" is\r\ntrue here. Therefore, spray while the worms are tiny and the foliage\r\nthin, and the work will count as the \"stitch in time,\" destroying nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENT-CATERPILLAR.\r\n\r\nNearly every one has seen the \"tents\" of these in neglected trees. See\r\nfig. 5. They usually betoken the too busy man--the man with too many\r\nirons in the fire. They are large, unsightly bunches of webs, closely\r\nwoven together at the forks of twigs at the ends of limbs or branches.\r\nThe parents of these worms are moths (see fig. 6) which appear in June\r\neach year, and deposit their eggs in clusters containing two or three\r\nhundred, surrounding small twigs. See fig. 7. Sharp eyes, a sharp knife\r\nand nimble fingers will bring many to the kitchen fire. These eggs hatch\r\nin the warm days of spring, and the tiny worms immediately seek and\r\ndevour the tender buds and leaves. The day they hatch they begin to\r\nbuild the \"tent.\" Those from the same mass of eggs, say 250, combine to\r\nmake the home nest or tent. They come out from this tent to feed in the\r\nmorning, return for a _siesta_ or sleep, and emerge again in the\r\nafternoon for a second feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Tent with larvae.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Adult.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Tent-caterpillar.]\r\n\r\nThey live in this way four or five weeks, becoming, when full grown,\r\nabout two inches long and nearly as large as a lead-pencil. See fig. 8.\r\nThey are black, with light-colored tufts of hair on the back. Down the\r\ncenter of the back is a white line bordered with irregular yellowish\r\nlines. The sides of the body are marked with pale blue, while the under\r\nside of the worm is black. When grown they pass to the ground and hunt a\r\nsheltered place, where they spin a cocoon, from which, in about three\r\nweeks, emerges the adult moth, fig. 6, the color of which varies from\r\nyellowish to reddish brown. The front wings each contain two oblique,\r\nwhitish lines, dividing the wing into three nearly equal parts. These\r\nmoths are night flyers during the last half of June and first half of\r\nJuly. They eat nothing. The female lays her eggs as described, and dies.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ Spare the birds; put up boxes for the bats and owls. Cut off\r\nthe egg clusters during the winter. Cut and burn the tents, or burn the\r\ntents on the tree, with any kind of a torch. Early morning or late\r\nevening is the time, as they are then all home. Spray the foliage\r\nnearest the tents with solutions for canker-worm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCODLING-MOTH.\r\n\r\nThe apple-worm, which every apple eater has found many times in the\r\napple, is the child of the codling-moth. See _b_, fig. 9. It is a\r\nscourge all over the apple-growing district. It destroys or reduces the\r\nvalue of the apple crop many millions of dollars annually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. _a_, Female Codling-moth. _b_, Larva of same in\r\napple.]\r\n\r\nThe parent--adult insect, or moth--see _a_, fig. 9, is a small moth with\r\na spread of wings three-fourths of an inch, the first pair marked with\r\nwavy lines of gray and brown, with a large, oval brown spot, streaked\r\ncoppery, on hinder margin. The hind wings are yellowish brown. These\r\nmoths appear, and begin to lay on the surface of the leaves, in the\r\ncalyx, or on the surface of the apple, about the 1st of May. The eggs\r\nhatch in about one week, and the young worm immediately begins to burrow\r\ninto the apple, working its way to the center, where it works around the\r\ncore, gaining strength and size for about three weeks, when it leaves\r\nthe apple and seeks a hiding place in which to spin its cocoon, the\r\nfavorite place being under projections of the rough bark of the tree.\r\nWhen first hatched these worms are small, hardly one-eighth of an inch\r\nlong, white, with a black head and shoulders. When mature, the body is\r\npinkish and the head and shoulders brown. The adult, _a_, fig. 9, issues\r\nfrom the cocoon in about two weeks, appearing near June 15. They\r\ncommence at once to lay eggs. The worms of this, the second brood, live\r\nin the apple all winter, and it is these that disgust the apple eater\r\nand cut the profits of the orchardist.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ The same spray as for canker-worms, used just after the\r\npetals of the blossom fall. No eggs are deposited earlier than this. At\r\nthis time the calyx cup is open, and a little poison in it is apt to\r\nprove fatal to the infant worm. In a few days after the egg is laid the\r\ncalyx closes, and no spray will reach the worm. Remember, this early\r\nspraying does away with the parents of the _second_ brood, and hence\r\nshould not be neglected. Bands of burlaps, paper or other material,\r\nloosely tied about the tree before June 1, make attractive places for\r\nthe worms to pupate in. These bands should be examined often, say\r\nweekly, and all worms killed. Fallen fruit should be gathered and fed to\r\nstock. Cellars, caves and fruit houses should be thoroughly cleaned and\r\nfumigated and the cleanings burned every spring, as many thousands of\r\nmoths are wintered over in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAT-HEADED BORER.\r\n\r\nThe adult, fig. 10, is flat, about three-eighths of an inch long, of a\r\ngreenish black with coppery reflections. They appear about the last of\r\nMay and deposit eggs from then until September. They generally lay their\r\neggs in a diseased portion of the tree, where it has been bruised, or\r\nsun-scalded, or in trees of weak vitality, in bad health from lack of\r\ncultivation or moisture, or from soil poverty. The eggs are small and\r\nyellowish, and are found singly or in numbers in crevices in the bark.\r\nThe larva, or borer, fig. 11, when young, is yellowish, with a broad,\r\nflat head; it soon bores to the sap-wood, where it feeds. At this time\r\nit is easily discovered by the \"castings\" from the opening. As they\r\nbecome older and larger they bore into the harder wood, making flattened\r\nchambers. In about a year they gnaw a channel to the outside, excepting\r\na thin layer of bark, and backing a little way they crowd castings to\r\nthe front and change into the perfect insect, emerging about the last of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Adult Flat-headed Borer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. Larva of a Flat-headed Borer.]\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ Keep the tree thrifty, free from bruises or sun-scald, and\r\nthe flow of sap will drown them. If any are detected by the castings,\r\ncut in, and use a hooked wire to pull them out. Some washes will deter\r\nthe female from depositing eggs. For instance: Equal parts of soft soap\r\nand sal soda, with enough crude carbolic acid to give a strong odor.\r\nApply with a brush several times in a season, especially where the bark\r\nappears unhealthy.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUND-HEADED BORER.\r\n\r\nAttacks the same trees under the same conditions as the flat-headed\r\nborer. The adult, fig. 12, is about five-eighths of an inch long, brown\r\nabove, with two white stripes the whole length of the back. Head and\r\nunder surface grayish. It is a night flyer. The female appears about\r\nJune 1, and stays until September. She deposits her eggs at night, in\r\nsmall incisions made angling into the bark, generally near the ground.\r\nIn about two weeks they hatch, and the little borers, _a_, fig. 13,\r\nbegin to bore their way into the inner bark and sap-wood, leaving the\r\nbore filled with \"castings,\" fig. 14. For two summers they stay in the\r\nsap-wood and do great damage, often girdling young trees. After the\r\nsecond winter they cut channels up into the hard wood; attaining their\r\ngrowth by fall, they burrow outward to the under side of the bark, and\r\nthere remain until spring, changing to adults. See _b_, fig. 13. They\r\nthen gnaw through the bark, and emerge about June 1 to propagate their\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ Same as for flat-headed borer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Adult Round-headed Borer, greatly enlarged.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Larva and pupa of the Round-headed Borer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. _a_, Incision in which egg is deposited; _b_,\r\nsame, the wood has been split along line _a_; _e_, showing egg in place;\r\n_c_, showing how egg is inserted under bark; _d_, egg greatly magnified;\r\n_e_, hole through which adult emerged; _f_, channel of larva; _g_,\r\ninsect in pupal state just before issuing as an adult.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTREE WASHES FOR BORERS.\r\n\r\n     Observations by members of the Kansas State Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nA. Chandler: I used a tree wash last year on apple trees for borers and\r\ninsects. I have been troubled in my timber (recently cleared) land with\r\nborers, and if I had not taken this precaution they would have been\r\nworse. It is known as the \"Carnahan tree wash.\" Obtaining it ready\r\nprepared in a can, I applied it in June with a whitewash brush to the\r\ntree trunks and a portion of the limbs, and found it very beneficial.\r\nWhile it will not _destroy_ the borer, I think it will prevent the borer\r\nbeetle from depositing eggs on the outside. From the healthy appearance\r\nof the tree and the smooth appearance of the bark, I think it equals\r\nanything I ever tried. It is also good for the prevention of other\r\ninsects, as tree-crickets, etc., and I think it will destroy the\r\ncurculio to some extent, and will prevent insects climbing the trees. My\r\ntrees never looked more thrifty. I cannot say it will prevent root-rot.\r\n\r\nF. Holsinger: I would like to inquire whether your ground was thoroughly\r\ncultivated?\r\n\r\nA. Chandler: All the cultivation I could give would not prevent borers.\r\nI applied the wash from the ground up, as far as I could reach. It costs\r\nabout two cents per tree from four to six years old, and I do not know\r\nbut what that might be reduced. This wash is obtained in gallon and\r\nhalf-gallon cans. It should be applied about twice a year--spring and\r\nfall--costing about four cents per year for each tree.\r\n\r\nT. A. Stanley: Would not a strong lime wash do as well.\r\n\r\nA. Chandler: No; I have no success with it. If the borer is in the tree,\r\nyou must dig him out with a knife. By examination you can tell whether\r\nborers have deposited eggs or not. I do not say it will rid the tree of\r\nborers if they have been allowed to deposit eggs and are left for years.\r\nIt makes the tree grow more vigorous. I do not know what is in this tree\r\nwash, but it did no damage.\r\n\r\nB. F. Smith: Chandler has tried this wash, and it has proven successful\r\nwith him. There are always new things being tried. If he has found\r\nsomething good for trees, we should not object to it. If I receive a\r\npackage I will try it.\r\n\r\nT. A. Stanley: My experience with borers will date back as far as fifty\r\nyears ago, when I was a boy, and the best thing to exterminate them with\r\nwas a jack-knife. A Boston gentleman visiting my father went into the\r\norchard and asked father if he had ever seen any borers. Father told him\r\nhe knew nothing about them (they were something new in those days).\r\nExamining a tree, he took out his jack-knife and went to work near the\r\nground, and he soon showed why the tree was not doing well. With his\r\nknife he dug the borer out and said the jack-knife was the best\r\nexterminator he knew of. My experience is, if you will attend to it\r\nabout the 1st of June, when the beetles come out on the tree and deposit\r\ntheir eggs behind loose scales of bark, and wash the tree with strong\r\nlime wash, it will kill them. I prefer lime wash to any \"nostrum\" ever\r\nintroduced. When they once get into the tree no wash will take them out.\r\nHorticulturists have been deceived enough by patent nostrums.\r\n\r\nE. J. Holman: By instinct this insect never lays its eggs on the\r\nsurface. It lays as completely in the wood as the locust, which\r\npunctures almost to the heart of a twig. A borer lives three years in\r\nthe wood; the third year it comes out in perfect form. It goes below in\r\nthe wood every winter, and the third spring passes the cocoon stage\r\nthere. They lay about fifty eggs, each placed separate and apart in the\r\nwood. Rarely does an egg fail to hatch.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Robison: These beetles are very fierce. Put a half dozen into a\r\nbottle and they will beat a bull fight, and will not stop until they\r\nkill each other. She is a philosopher; she makes punctures sideways, so\r\nthe eggs can be laid in a row, and the bark close over them. It is only\r\na few days until they hatch; open the lip where deposited and you can\r\nsee them plainly. Without cutting the bark, thrust your knife under the\r\nlip and you can hear the eggs crack. The larva works round and round\r\nuntil of the size of a pea, and then usually starts upward until he gets\r\nlevel with the surface of the ground, staying there until the next\r\nseason. He comes up early in the spring. My practice is to hoe around\r\nthe tree before the time for the round-headed borer to deposit eggs. I\r\nkeep the weeds clear, so that I can see where the borer went in. If he\r\nhas been in a year or two he is near the middle, and you had better let\r\nhim alone, as it will injure the tree to remove him. It is impossible to\r\nget rid of these borers by a wash, because the eggs are covered. There\r\nis no connection between the round-headed and flat-headed borers.\r\n\r\nT. A. Stanley: It requires three years for the borer to mature and come\r\nout. In my experience, the borer selects a spot where loose bark is on\r\nthe tree, and goes in where it is tender. It lays eggs in even rows.\r\nThese eggs stay under the bark but a short time when they hatch and the\r\nlittle worm eats into the tender bark, and goes through it, to live and\r\ngrow there; when large enough they go into the body of the tree. They\r\nstay there for three years. Scrape off the bark and put whitewash on the\r\neggs and it will destroy them.\r\n\r\nPresident Wellhouse: By taking a knife, cutting into the tree, and\r\nrunning a hooked wire in, you can pull them out. Each female beetle\r\ndeposits fifty or sixty eggs, and we find it better and less expensive\r\nto hunt the borers early in the spring. By carefully examining the\r\nbottom of the tree for six or eight inches above the ground you will see\r\na little brown spot. He came to the bark the fall previous, and sets\r\nabout two inches back in his cavity. If you wait till May, he is out and\r\ngone; he is easier taken out in spring than later. By killing the insect\r\nyou prevent the egg laying. We always have our men hunt for the insects\r\nthat are about to come out. It is easy to find the little brown spot\r\nabout the size of your finger end, and you can kill them by pouring a\r\nfew drops of coal-oil from a machine can into the cavity.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Stayman: Can we prevent the borer from entering the tree? I have\r\npracticed banking up my trees as steep as I can, about a foot high; less\r\nmay do. The beetle will not deposit eggs where the tree is banked up. I\r\nhave practiced this for thirty years, and have never seen a borer in my\r\ntrees since I began it. Like these gentlemen, I at first cut out the\r\nborers. We can prevent them by banking up early in the spring. By\r\ninstinct, it knows the bank will wash down. If it deposits its eggs, how\r\neasy to scrape away the mound. I never saw a flathead borer on a tree\r\nthat was banked. They always work on the south side, where the sun\r\nshines on the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUD MOTH.\r\n\r\nThis insect is often very destructive, attacking the blossom and\r\nleaf-buds, and in a few mouthfuls destroying that which must make the\r\nleaves and fruit, \"nipping in the bud\" the entire crop of fruit and\r\ndebilitating the tree. This worm works in early spring, as soon as the\r\nbuds begin to open; it delights in the prominent terminal buds and its\r\nwork stops all new growth, causes many leaves to turn brown, and thus\r\nbrings to the notice of the orchardist its bad work. The moth measures\r\nabout three-quarters of an inch across its wings, and is mainly a gray\r\ncolor, the middle of the fore wings being lighter, or creamy. This\r\ninsect first appears on the buds as a small, dark brown worm, about\r\none-fourth of an inch long, with shining black head and shoulders. It\r\nimbeds itself in the center of the bud, tying the leaves together with\r\nits web. It is an irregular worker, and leaves the bud in a ragged,\r\nbrown, dilapidated condition.\r\n\r\nIts work is most destructive in the nursery, destroying terminal shoots,\r\nwhich sadly interferes with the growth and symmetry of the young tree.\r\nSometimes it burrows from the bud into the pith of the twig for several\r\ninches, killing the shoot to the tip. The worm finally settles upon a\r\nleaf, cutting the leaf stalk partly off, so that the leaf withers; it\r\nthen rolls this soft, wilted leaf into a tube around its body, fastening\r\nit with webs and lining it for a nest. From this tube nest it comes\r\nforth only at night to feed, and when disturbed it hastens into it out\r\nof sight. In feeding, it draws leaves towards its home by silken\r\nthreads, thus forming a bunch of partly eaten leaves, which turn brown,\r\nmaking the nest conspicuous.\r\n\r\nAfter attaining its growth it lies as a pupa in its silk-lined tube\r\nabout ten days, when it emerges an adult moth, and in three or four days\r\nbegins to lay its eggs. These moths appear from about June 1 and remain\r\nto July 5 or July 10. They are night flyers, and do no damage in the\r\nwinged state. As the worms are leaf-eaters, spraying with London purple\r\nor Paris green, as for canker-worms, must kill many. Whenever their\r\nnests are seen they should, if possible, be gathered and burned, and in\r\na badly infested orchard it will pay to rake and burn all the leaves\r\nunder the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLE CURCULIO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. _a_, Beetle, natural size; _b_, beetle,\r\nmagnified; _c_, side and back view of same, magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. _a_, Pupa stage; _b_, larva, or worm. Hair-lines\r\nto the left of pupa show natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis insect, fig. 15, is usually of a uniform rusty brown color. Four\r\nhumps or tubercles are easily seen, two on each wing cover near the\r\nrear. The snout varies from half to the full length of the insect. With\r\nthis snout it drills round holes into the apple; these holes are made\r\nfor food, and are about one-tenth of an inch deep, widened out below\r\nlike a gourd. The female deposits an egg in such hole, which soon\r\nhatches into a tiny worm that usually burrows to the core, and produces\r\na reddish excrement. In a month, when fully grown, the worm is soft and\r\nwhite, without feet, wrinkled, and curved crosswise, as in _b_, fig. 16;\r\ntoo humped and crooked to crawl about out of the apple, it stays in and\r\nchanges to pupa, as in _a_, fig. 16, leaving the apple as a perfect\r\nbeetle after two or three weeks. It passes the winter in the adult state\r\nand begins laying eggs about June 1, continuing until late in August.\r\nPresident Wellhouse says he has surely reduced them by spraying.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAF-CRUMPLER, or LEAF-ROLLER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.       FIG. 18.\r\nHere _a_ represents worm case; _b_, case attached to a limb; _c_, head\r\nand first segments; _d_, perfect moth. All are magnified; the hair-lines\r\njust under the moth, _d_, represent the natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe parent of this is a small grayish moth, _d_, fig. 17, which emerges\r\nfrom the unsightly mass of dry leaves, as in _b_, fig. 18, formed the\r\nprevious season by the insect, and may be seen, gathered, and burned,\r\nduring the winter. The female immediately begins laying eggs upon the\r\nleaves of the tree. During the fore part of June small, brownish worms\r\nappear, which at once construct tubular silken cases, in which they\r\nhide. They leave these cases, generally at night, to feed. As they grow\r\nthey attach webs to the partly eaten leaves and gather them about\r\nthemselves, so that finally the irregular mass of leaves completely\r\nhides the tubular case. In the spring, as the buds swell and the leaves\r\nappear, they come out and do great damage. They grow until in May, when\r\nthey close up the opening to the case, and in two weeks the moth\r\nemerges, as above.\r\n\r\n_Remedies._ There are two parasites that prey upon them. Collect the\r\ncases and tufts of leaves during the winter and burn them. The spray\r\nrecommended for canker-worm is successful in destroying them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWIG-GIRDLER, TWIG-PRUNER, and TWIG-BORER.\r\n\r\nSometimes trouble orchards, but in Kansas they are not bad. Their habits\r\nare indicated by their names, and it is scarcely necessary to describe\r\nthem in this work. Numerous bulletins are issued free, describing them\r\nand their habits. See fig. 19.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Twig-girdler at work.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT-LOUSE, or WOOLLY APHIS.\r\n\r\nThe young are hatched from a minute egg laid in crevices of the bark,\r\nnear the ground, and are covered with white down. The grown female\r\nmeasures about one-tenth of an inch in length, oval in shape, with black\r\nhead and feet, dusty legs and antennae. They attach themselves to the\r\nbranches and trunk with their long beaks, sucking the vitality from the\r\ntree, which they will kill if in large numbers. During the summer the\r\nfemales are wingless, but at autumn both sexes have wings, and it is in\r\nthis condition that they spread rapidly. They are produced alive at this\r\ntime of the year with wonderful rapidity. Where plentiful the trunk and\r\nbranches have a moldy appearance. \"Lady-birds\" and their larvae, the\r\nlarvae of lace-winged flies and syrphus-flies, the small chalcid fly and\r\nspiders devour them. No birds are known to feed upon them.\r\n\r\n_Remedy._ Plenty of lye wash, even soap-suds or soap wash is good.\r\nKerosene emulsion is good. The insect above described is only one form,\r\nviz., woolly aphis. The other form, as root-louse, is described below.\r\nTo the public they are two distinct insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOT-LOUSE.\r\n\r\nThey work underground, puncturing the root to draw its nourishing juice,\r\ncausing the root tissue to expand into knots and irregularities, _a_,\r\nfig. 20, thus making the roots unhealthy and very brittle. These insects\r\nare often found in myriads, looking like bluish-white wool, on the\r\nroots. Certain beetles, maggots and flies prey upon them, but to only a\r\nsmall extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Root-louse.]\r\n\r\n_Remedy._ Scalding water, at 150 degrees, poured on the uncovered roots.\r\nIf some concentrated lye is added it is still better. Filling above the\r\nroots with tobacco dust is recommended. Soap-suds and wood ashes are\r\nbeneficial. Young trees from the nursery, if infested, should have the\r\nroots well trimmed (burn the trimmings) and then dipped in lye. If quite\r\nhot it is still better.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRINGED-WING APPLE-BUD MOTH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe following is condensed from bulletin No. 42, written by Prof. J. M.\r\nStedman, entomologist of the state university, Columbia, Mo.: The\r\nfringed-wing apple-bud moth is a new and heretofore undescribed species\r\nof insect, increasing rapidly and infesting new areas. The best spray to\r\ndestroy them is, one pound pure Paris green, three pounds of fresh lime,\r\nand 150 gallons of water, constantly agitated while spraying. First\r\napplication as soon as the buds open sufficiently to give the tree a\r\ngreen tinge; second, five days later; third, at time flower-buds open;\r\nif it rains do it over at once. Kill the worms before they eat into the\r\nbud. The egg is very small, light yellow, and oval, and apt to escape\r\nnotice. The young worm is also very small when hatched and of a light\r\nyellow color, which afterwards turns to pale green, a shining black\r\nhead, and a brown spot (which soon turns black) back of the head. It has\r\nthree pairs of dark-colored true legs under its fore parts, and five\r\npairs of prolegs under the rear three-fifths of the body. As soon as\r\nhatched they begin to feed on the unfolding leaves, and at once crawl to\r\nthe heart of the expanded flower or leaf-bud.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Work of the Fringed-wing Apple-bud Moth.]\r\n\r\nThe destructive effects cause the tree to look as if swept by fire,\r\nowing to the brown and partly developed foliage. See fig. 24. These\r\nworms (fig. 21) complete their growth in about four weeks, enter the\r\nearth, and, passing one or two inches below the surface, spin a cocoon.\r\nThey come out as adult moths in about six weeks, or about the middle of\r\nJuly. Fig. 22 is the moth enlarged; fig. 23, natural size. The females\r\nsoon begin to lay eggs, singly, on the young apple leaves. From these\r\neggs a second brood is hatched more quickly than the spring brood. This\r\nsecond brood often eats through the heart of the terminal bud into the\r\ntwig. When grown, this second brood enters the ground as did the first,\r\nbut do not come forth as adults until the following spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABBITS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe Wellhouse rabbit trap, of which we here give description and\r\nillustrations, is one used by President Wellhouse. He has 3000 of them,\r\ndistributed two per acre, and says it is the result of thirty years'\r\nexperience. He uses nothing else to protect his trees. Figure 25 is a\r\nlongitudinal section of the trap. Figure 26 is a front-end view of the\r\ntrap, on a scale three times that of fig. 25, and shows the details of\r\nthe door. The trap consists of a box made of fence boards (old ones\r\npreferred) six inches wide and one inch thick. The boards are cut\r\ntwenty-two inches long, and the top and bottom boards are nailed onto\r\nthe side boards, thus making the opening four inches wide and six inches\r\nhigh. The door, _a_, is made of wire, shaped as shown in fig. 26, and\r\nhung to under side of the top board with two staples, shown at _dd_. The\r\ntrigger, _b_, is of wire, bent as in fig. 25, spread out, or with a loop\r\nor figure 8, at the hanging end, and is fastened loosely along the\r\ncenter on the under side of the top board with two staples.\r\n\r\nTo operate the trap, push the door, _a_, inward, and with the forefinger\r\ncatch the hooked end of the trigger, _g_, and pull it forward until the\r\ndoor rests on the wire above the hook at _g_. The rabbit enters the\r\ntrap, prompted by curiosity or otherwise, and by so doing pushes the\r\ntrigger, _c_, back as he would a little brush in a hollow log, without\r\nany suspicion or alarm. This action loosens the door, which falls behind\r\nhim, its lower edge resting against the shoulder at _f_, and bunny is\r\nthen caught. This trap was invented by Walter Wellhouse, but it is not\r\npatented. He uses no bait. The trap cannot be sprung by birds or wind.\r\nIf new lumber is used, it must be stained some dark color, using\r\nmaterial not offensive to a rabbit's delicate sense of smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLES FOR THE TABLE.\r\n\r\n     Compiled, by request, by Miss GERTRUDE COBURN, Professor of\r\n     Domestic Economy, Iowa Agricultural College, Ames, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemical analysis of apples, fairly representing the average\r\ncomposition, indicates that the total nutriment is about fifteen per\r\ncent. of the whole weight, and consists principally of sugar, organic\r\nacid, and pectin (which gelatinizes when boiled and cooled). Although\r\nthe fruit is thus shown to be but slightly nutritious, it is generally\r\npalatable and wholesome. It easily supplies variety in diet throughout\r\nthe year, and it has the advantage of being suitable for any meal and\r\ncombining agreeably with many other common food materials.\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, and carefully selected, the uncooked apple is toothsome and\r\nhealthful, either alone and between meals or as one of the table fruits.\r\nThe indigestible skin and cellulose, with the water and acid, contribute\r\nto the dietetic value, in that they make the whole raw apple a laxative\r\nfood, especially effective when eaten before breakfast or at night.\r\n\r\nCooked entire, and without any addition, the well-flavored apple is\r\namong the most perfect and economical of the subacid fruits for\r\nevery-day use, and for the invalid's tray is seldom surpassed. Baked in\r\nits own juice, with sugar and additional flavoring, or boiled in syrup,\r\nit is relished equally with the breakfast mush, the dinner meat, and the\r\nsupper bread and cake. Combined with cream, custard, whipped white of\r\negg, or tapioca, which add nutriment without destroying the fruit\r\nflavor, it affords a delicate dessert, inexpensive and easily prepared.\r\nSteamed or baked, with a light covering or crust of biscuit dough or\r\npastry, it has a variety of forms, all used for dinner, and usually made\r\ncomplete with sweetened cream, or in other cases with a bit of good\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\nThe skin, while not digestible, is not often injurious, and as the best\r\nflavor is contained in the surface portion of the apple, careless paring\r\nis wasteful and unnecessary, especially when the fruit is to be baked.\r\nThe unbroken envelope retains the steam produced as the juice is heated,\r\nthus hastening the process of expanding and bursting the tiny cells and\r\nconverting the firm pulp into a delicate sauce. This suggests that, in\r\norder to produce the desirable lightness, the oven should be\r\nsufficiently hot to change the water of the fruit into steam. If the\r\nskin is tough or for other reasons is removed, the clean, unblemished\r\nparings, with the cores, may be simmered in water until the flavor and\r\ncolor make it a useful addition for pudding sauce, preserves, or jelly.\r\nIt is usually best to remove the core before cooking, and, when the\r\napple (as for compote) is not to be otherwise cut after paring, it\r\nshould be cored before the skin is taken off, to prevent breaking.\r\n\r\nThe various forms of boiled and steamed apples are attractive and\r\ngenerally liked. The requisites are: To select good fruit and wash it\r\nclean before cutting; to remove only a thin paring, _all_ of the core,\r\nand the bruised, discolored and defective parts; to intensify rather\r\nthan obscure the apple flavor, using only enough of sugar, spice, or\r\nlemon, when any is needed, to accomplish this purpose; to use granite or\r\nporcelain-lined utensils (avoiding even tin covers) and silver or wooden\r\nspoons; to retain by slow cooking and careful handling the perfect form\r\nof the fruit, or else to produce, by stirring and straining, a light,\r\nlumpless sauce; to serve the apple preparation with the same respectful\r\nand dainty care that is usually bestowed upon the rarer but not more\r\nworthy pineapple and orange.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and autumn, when the fruit is at its best, no additional\r\nflavor is needed. Toward spring, when it becomes less palatable, the\r\ndeficiency may be best supplied with a little lemon juice and grated\r\nrind, a bit of pineapple or quince, a few drops of almond extract or\r\nrose water, or a few whole cloves. Sweet apples which are dry and rather\r\ntasteless may be utilized satisfactorily if stewed, canned or preserved\r\nwith one-third their bulk of quince.\r\n\r\nApples, Raw, for Breakfast.--Select fresh, unspotted apples of good\r\nflavor, but not very sour, wash and wipe thoroughly, and arrange\r\ntastefully, alone or with other fruit. For serving, use small plates and\r\nfruit-knives, to be removed with them. Individual taste must decide\r\nwhether the fruit should be eaten before or after the heavier part of\r\nthe breakfast.\r\n\r\nApples and Cream.--A delicious breakfast dish, to be served with the\r\ncooked cereal or alone, consists of fresh, mellow, sweet apples, pared\r\nand sliced, sprinkled with fine sugar and dressed with cream.\r\n\r\nApples and Bread and Milk.--For a summer luncheon, a bowl of rich milk\r\nand bread may be pleasantly varied by the addition of a ripe sweet\r\napple, pared and thinly sliced. If the fruit is not thoroughly ripe and\r\nmellow, it is improved by slow baking until quite soft.\r\n\r\nBaked Apples.--Select moderately tart or very juicy sweet apples, of\r\nequal size. Wash them, remove the cores (or at least the blossom ends)\r\nand any imperfections, with the skin also, if it is objectionable. Put\r\nin a shallow baking dish, and fill the cavities with sugar and such\r\nflavoring as seems to be demanded, allowing from one-third to one-half\r\nof a cup of sugar and about one-fourth of a teaspoonful of nutmeg or\r\ncinnamon to eight apples, with sometimes the juice and grated rind of\r\nhalf a lemon. Cover the bottom of the dish with boiling water (which may\r\nneed to be replenished if the fruit is not very juicy), and bake in a\r\nhot oven until soft, basting often with the syrup in the dish. Sweet\r\napples need to bake longer and more slowly than sour, and when done\r\nshould be very soft. Set the baking dish in a cool place until the fruit\r\nis almost cold, then transfer the apples to a glass dish and pour the\r\nsyrup, which should be thick and amber colored, around them.\r\n\r\nApples in Bloom. (By consent, from \"Boston Cooking-School Cook-Book,\" by\r\nMiss Farmer.)--Select eight red apples, cook in boiling water until\r\nsoft, turning them often. Have water half surround apples. Remove skins\r\ncarefully, that the red color may remain, and arrange on a serving dish.\r\nTo the water add one cup sugar, grated rind one-half lemon, and juice\r\none orange; simmer until reduced to one cup. Cool, and pour over apples.\r\nServe with sweetened whipped cream or cream sauce.\r\n\r\nBaked Apple-Sauce. (By consent, from \"Every-Day Dishes,\" by Mrs. E. E.\r\nKellogg.)--Pare, core and quarter apples to fill an earthen crock or\r\ndeep pudding dish, taking care to use apples of uniform degree of\r\nhardness and pieces of the same size. For two quarts of fruit thus\r\nprepared, add a cup of water and, if the apples are sour, a cup of\r\nsugar. Cover closely, and bake in a moderate oven several hours, or\r\nuntil of a dark red color. Sweet apples and quinces, in the proportion\r\nof two parts of apple to one of quince, baked in this way, are also\r\ngood. Cut the apples into quarters, but slice the quinces much thinner\r\nas they are more difficult to cook. Put a layer of quince on the bottom\r\nof the dish, and alternate with layers of apple until the dish is full.\r\nAdd cold water to half cover the fruit, and stew in the oven, well\r\ncovered, without stirring, until tender. Fruit cooked in this way may be\r\ncanned while hot and kept for a long period.\r\n\r\nStewed Apples.--Pare, quarter and core six or eight tart apples; put\r\nthem into a granite kettle, strew with one cup or less of sugar, add\r\njuice of half a lemon and a few bits of the yellow rind; cover with\r\nboiling water and simmer (not boil) until tender. Dish carefully,\r\nwithout breaking, and serve cold.\r\n\r\nGreen-Apple Sauce.--For sour green apples it is best to use a sharp\r\nsilver knife, to prevent discoloration. Cut the apples in quarters,\r\nremove the cores and skin, and drop them as fast as pared into a bowl of\r\ncold water. Skim them out into a granite kettle with a large bottom, so\r\nthat there will not be much depth to the apples. Add boiling water\r\nenough to show among the pieces, cover tightly, and cook quickly. Shake\r\nthe pan occasionally, and as soon as the fruit is soft mash it with a\r\nsilver fork, add sugar to taste, and when it is dissolved remove from\r\nthe fire. Serve hot or cold. This sauce should be free from lumps, light\r\ncolored and not very sweet. A pinch of salt may be an improvement.\r\n\r\nApple-Sauce For Goose or Pork.--Pare, quarter and core six tart apples.\r\nPut them in a granite saucepan, cover with water, boil until tender, and\r\npress through a colander; add a teaspoonful of butter, a dash of nutmeg\r\nor cinnamon, and sugar to taste, being careful to keep the sauce tart.\r\n\r\nCanned Apples. (By consent, from Mrs. Rorer's \"Philadelphia\r\nCook-Book.\")--To four pounds of apples use one pound of sugar, the juice\r\nand yellow rind of one lemon, and one quart of water. Choose fine ripe\r\nPippins or Bellflowers. Pare, core, and throw them into cold water. When\r\nyou have sufficient to fill one or two jars, lift them carefully from\r\nthe water, weigh, then put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with\r\nboiling water, bring quickly to the boiling-point, and then stand them\r\nover a moderate fire, where they will scarcely bubble, until tender.\r\nWhile they are cooking, put the sugar and water into another kettle,\r\nstir with a clean wooden spoon until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved,\r\nadd the lemon, and boil three minutes. With a perforated skimmer lift\r\nthe apples from the water, hold a moment until drained, and then slide\r\nthem carefully into the boiling syrup; continue until the bottom of the\r\nkettle is covered; boil until the apples are sufficiently tender to\r\nadmit a straw, then lift them carefully and slide one at time into the\r\njar. The jars should be thoroughly cleaned and heated and set on a\r\nfolded wet towel. After passing a silver spoon handle around the inside\r\nof the filled jar to break any air bubbles present, screw on the top as\r\nquickly as possible. Stand the jars in a warm place in the kitchen over\r\nnight, and in the morning again tighten the covers and put away in a\r\ncool, dark, dry closet.\r\n\r\nApple Compote. (By consent, from Mrs. Lincoln's \"Boston\r\nCook-Book.\")--Make a syrup with one cup of sugar, one cup of water, and\r\na square inch of stick cinnamon. Boil slowly for ten minutes, skimming\r\nwell. Core and pare eight or ten tart apples and cook until nearly done\r\nin the syrup. Drain, and cook them for a few minutes in the oven, with\r\nthe door open. Boil the syrup until almost like a jelly. Arrange the\r\napples on a dish for serving, fill the core cavities with jelly or\r\nmarmalade, and pour the syrup over them. Put whipped cream around the\r\nbase and garnish the cream with jelly.\r\n\r\nApple Preserves. (By consent, from Mrs. Rorer's \"Philadelphia\r\nCook-Book.\")--Core and pare fine ripe Pippins, and cut them into\r\nquarters. Weigh, and to each pound allow one pound of granulated sugar\r\nand a half pint of boiling water, the grated rind of one and the juice\r\nof two lemons. Boil the sugar and water until clear (about three\r\nminutes), skimming when necessary; add the lemon juice and rind, then\r\nthe apples, and _simmer_ gently until they are clear and tender, but not\r\nbroken; then stand aside to cool. When cold put them into jars, cover\r\nclosely, and stand them in a cool, dark place for one week. At the end\r\nof that time turn them carefully into the kettle, bring them to the\r\nboiling-point, and _simmer_ for five minutes; then return them to the\r\njars, cover closely with tissue paper brushed over with the white of an\r\negg, and put in a dark, cool place to keep.\r\n\r\nApple Butter. (By consent, from Mrs. Rorer's \"Philadelphia\r\nCook-Book.\")--This should be made from new cider, fresh from the press,\r\nand not yet fermented. Fill a porcelain-lined kettle with cider, and\r\nboil until reduced one-half. Then boil another kettleful in the same\r\nway, and so continue until you have sufficient quantity. To every four\r\ngallons of boiled cider allow a half-bushel of nice, juicy apples,\r\npared, cored, and quartered. The cider should be boiled the day before\r\nyou make the apple butter. Put the boiled cider in a very large kettle,\r\nand add as many apples as can be kept moist. Stir frequently, and when\r\nthe apples are soft beat with a wooden stick until they are reduced to a\r\npulp. Cook and stir continuously until the consistency is that of soft\r\nmarmalade and the color is very dark brown. Have boiled cider at hand in\r\ncase it becomes too thick, and apples if too thin. Twenty minutes before\r\nyou take it from the fire add ground cinnamon and nutmeg to taste. It\r\nrequires no sugar. When cold, put into stone jars and cover closely.\r\n\r\nApple Jelly. (By consent, from Mrs. Rorer's \"Philadelphia Cook\r\nBook.\")--Lady Blush or Fall Pippins are best for jelly. The first make a\r\nbright-red jelly, and the latter an almost white jelly. Wipe the fruit,\r\ncut it into pieces without paring or removing the seeds. Put into kettle\r\nand barely cover with cold water; cover the kettle, and boil slowly\r\nuntil the apples are very tender; then drain them through a flannel\r\njelly bag--do not squeeze or the jelly will be cloudy. To every pint of\r\nthis juice allow one pound of granulated sugar. Put the juice into the\r\nkettle and bring it quickly to the boiling-point; add the sugar and stir\r\nuntil dissolved, and then boil rapidly and continuously until it\r\njellies, skimming as a scum rises to the surface. Twenty minutes is\r\nusually sufficient for the boiling, though not always. After fifteen\r\nminutes' boiling begin the testing by taking out one teaspoonful of the\r\nboiling jelly, pouring it into the bottom of a saucepan, and standing it\r\nin a cool place for a moment. Scrape it up with the side of a spoon,\r\nand, if jellied, the surface will be partly solid; if not, boil a few\r\nminutes longer and try again; as soon as it jellies roll the tumblers in\r\nboiling water and fill with the boiling liquid. Stand aside until cold\r\nand firm (about twenty-four hours). If the glasses have lids put them\r\non; if not, cover with two thicknesses of tissue paper and paste the\r\nedges down over the edge of the tumbler. Then moisten the papers with a\r\nsponge dipped in cold water, so that when it dries it will shrink and be\r\ntight. Keep in a cool, dark place.\r\n\r\nApple Rose Cream. (By consent, from Mrs. E. E. Kellogg's \"Every-Day\r\nDishes.\")--Wash, core, slice and cook without paring a dozen fresh Snow\r\napples until soft and very dry. Rub through a colander to remove skins,\r\nadd sugar to taste and the beaten whites of two eggs, beating vigorously\r\nuntil stiff; add a teaspoonful of rose-water for flavoring, and serve at\r\nonce or keep on ice. It is important that the apples be very dry, as\r\notherwise the cream will not be light. Other varieties of apples may be\r\nused, and flavored with vanilla or pineapple. It is sometimes better to\r\nsteam the apples than to stew them tender.\r\n\r\nApple Tapioca Pudding. (By consent, from Mrs. Lincoln's \"Boston\r\nCook-Book.\")--Pick over and wash three-quarters of a cup of pearl\r\ntapioca. Pour one quart of boiling water over it, and cook in the double\r\nboiler until transparent; stir often and add a half teaspoonful of salt.\r\nCore and pare seven apples. Put them in a round baking dish and fill the\r\ncore cavities with sugar and lemon juice. Pour the tapioca over them\r\nand bake until the apples are very soft. Serve hot or cold, with sugar\r\nand cream. A delicious variation may be made by using half pears or\r\ncanned quinces and half apples.\r\n\r\nApple and Rice Pudding.--Steam one cupful of rice in two cupfuls of\r\nboiling salted water until soft. With this, line a buttered pudding dish\r\non the sides and bottom, leaving a portion for the top. Fill the dish\r\nwith thinly sliced tart apples and cover with the remainder of the rice.\r\nPut the dish in a steamer and steam until the apples are found to be\r\ntender by running a fork into them. Set it away to cool and invert the\r\ndish so that the pudding will come out entire. Serve with sweetened\r\ncream, thin custard, or fruit sauce. Flavoring may be added to the apple\r\naccording to taste.\r\n\r\nDutch Apple Cake. (By consent, from Mrs. Lincoln's \"Boston\r\nCook-Book.\")--One pint flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, two heaping\r\nteaspoonfuls baking-powder, one-fourth cup butter, one egg, one scant\r\ncup milk, four sour apples, two tablespoonfuls sugar. Mix the dry\r\ningredients in the order given; rub in the butter, beat the egg and mix\r\nit with the milk, then stir this into the dry mixture. The dough should\r\nbe soft enough to spread half an inch thick on a shallow baking pan.\r\nCore, pare and cut four or five apples into eighths; lay them in\r\nparallel rows on top of the dough, the sharp edge down, and press enough\r\nto make the edge penetrate slightly. Sprinkle the sugar on the apple.\r\nBake in a hot oven twenty or thirty minutes. To be eaten hot with butter\r\nas a tea cake, or with lemon sauce or with sugar and cream as a pudding.\r\n\r\nScalloped Apples. (By consent, from Mrs. Lincoln's \"Boston\r\nCook-Book.\")--Mix half a cup of sugar and an eighth of a teaspoonful of\r\ncinnamon or the grated rind of half a lemon. Melt half a cup of butter\r\nand stir it into one pint of soft bread crumbs; prepare three pints of\r\nsliced apples. Butter a pudding dish, put in a layer of crumbs, then\r\nsliced apple, and sprinkle with sugar; then another layer of crumbs,\r\napple, and sugar, until the materials are used. Have a thick layer of\r\ncrumbs on top. When the apples are not juicy, add half a cup of cold\r\nwater; and if not tart apples, add the juice of half a lemon. Bake about\r\nan hour, covering at first to prevent burning. Serve with cream. Ripe\r\nberries and other acid fruits may be used instead of the apples, and\r\noat-meal or cracked-wheat mush in place of the bread crumbs.\r\n\r\nBrown Betty. (By consent, from \"Century Cook-Book.\")--In a quart pudding\r\ndish arrange alternate layers of sliced apples and bread crumbs; season\r\neach layer with bits of butter, a little sugar, and a pinch each of\r\nground cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. When the dish is full pour over\r\nit a half cupful each of molasses and water mixed; cover the top with\r\ncrumbs. Place the dish in a pan containing hot water, and bake for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour, or until the apples are soft. Serve with\r\ncream or with any sauce. Raisins or chopped almonds improve the pudding.\r\n\r\nFriar's Omelet. (Mrs. Treat.)--Stew six or seven good-sized apples as\r\nfor apple-sauce; when cooked and still warm stir in one teaspoonful of\r\nbutter and one cupful of sugar; when cold, stir in three well-beaten\r\neggs and a little lemon juice. Now put a small piece of butter into a\r\nsaucepan, and, when hot, add to it a cupful of bread crumbs and stir\r\nuntil they assume a light-brown color. Butter a pudding mold, and\r\nsprinkle on the bottom and sides as many of these bread crumbs as will\r\nadhere; fill in the apple preparation, sprinkle bread crumbs on top,\r\nbake it for fifteen or twenty minutes, and turn it out on a good-sized\r\nplatter. It can be eaten with or without a sweet sauce.\r\n\r\nBaked Apple Dumplings.--Make a short pie-crust; roll it thin and cut it\r\ninto squares large enough to cover an apple. Select apples of the same\r\nsize, core and pare them, and fill the space with sugar, butter, and a\r\nlittle ground cinnamon or nutmeg. Place an apple in each square of\r\npie-crust; wet the edges with water or white of egg, and fold together\r\nso that the points meet on the top. Pinch and turn the edges so that\r\nthey are fluted. Bake in a moderate oven about forty minutes, or until\r\nthe apples are soft without having lost their form. Serve with hard\r\nsauce or with sugar and cream.\r\n\r\nSteamed Apple Dumplings.--Core and pare six or eight apples. Make a\r\nbiscuit dough, using four cups of flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls of\r\nbaking-powder, one large tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of\r\nsalt, and one cup of milk. Use more or less milk as is needed to make a\r\nsoft dough that will roll out without being sticky. Roll the dough about\r\nhalf an inch thick and cut in squares to cover the apples, as in the\r\npreceding recipe, after sweetening and flavoring. Place the dumplings on\r\na dinner plate which can be set in the steamer. Steam forty minutes and\r\nserve from the same plate, with hard sauce or sweetened cream. A\r\nvariation of this recipe, which is sometimes more convenient, is as\r\nfollows: Cut the apples into eighths, and put them, with half a cup of\r\nwater, into a granite pudding pan; roll the biscuit dough out to fit the\r\npan, and cover the apples; cover the pan, and steam or cook in the oven.\r\nSprinkle sugar thickly over the top and serve in the pudding pan, with\r\nhard sauce in another dish.\r\n\r\nApple Pie. (By consent, from \"Boston Cooking-School Cook-Book,\" by Miss\r\nFarmer.)--Four or five sour apples, one-third cup sugar, one-fourth\r\nteaspoon grated nutmeg, one-eighth teaspoon salt, one teaspoon butter,\r\none teaspoon lemon juice, few gratings lemon rind. Line pie plate with\r\npaste. Pare, core, and cut the apples into eighths; put row around the\r\nplate one-half inch from the edge, and work toward the center until the\r\nplate is covered; then pile on the remainder. Mix sugar, nutmeg, salt,\r\nlemon juice and rind and sprinkle over the apples. Dot over with butter.\r\nWet edges of under crust, cover with upper crust, and press edges\r\ntogether. Bake forty to forty-five minutes in a moderate oven. A very\r\ngood pie may be made without butter or lemon. Cinnamon may be\r\nsubstituted for nutmeg. Evaporated apples soaked over night in cold\r\nwater may be used in place of the fresh fruit.\r\n\r\nApple Fritters.--Core and pare three or four apples. Cut them crosswise\r\ninto slices one-third of an inch thick, leaving the opening in the\r\ncenter. Sprinkle with lemon, sugar, and spice. Let stand one hour. Dip\r\neach slice in fritter batter, and fry in deep, hot fat. Drain, and\r\nsprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve hot, with or without hard sauce.\r\n\r\nBatter For Fritters.--One cup flour, one-fourth teaspoonful salt,\r\ntwo-thirds cup milk, yolks and whites of two eggs beaten separately, one\r\ntablespoonful olive oil or melted butter. Mix salt and flour, add milk\r\ngradually, yolks of eggs, butter, and stiff whites.

Thus the water is H2O.\r\n\r\nMixed fractions in the text version have been represented with a hyphen\r\nseparating the whole and fractional parts. Thus two and five eighths is\r\n2-5/8.\r\n\r\nThere was no table of contents in the original; I added a short one for\r\nthe reader's convenience.\r\n\r\nChanged 'horticulural' to 'horticultural' on page 4: \"horticultural\r\nsocieties\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'CoO' (cobalt oxide) to 'CaO' (calcium oxide) in header of table\r\non page 7.\r\n\r\nThe numbers in table No. 1 on page 9 only add to 97 lbs. I left them as\r\nis. A good guess would be that water should be 85.66 lbs.\r\n\r\nChanged '49-5/9' to '45-5/9' to correct the arithmetic on page 9:\r\n\"averaging 45-5/9 pounds per barrel\".\r\n\r\nThe last two lines of text on page 11, \"like this: One barrel Ben Davis,\r\n$3.80; freight, $1.35; commission, 20 cents; net proceeds, $2.25. This\r\nis supposing they should reach the other side loose.\", apparently belong\r\non page 12. They were moved after \"A report of sales would read\r\nsomething\".\r\n\r\nThe acreages for the Wellhouse orchards don't add up right on page 14,\r\nbut I just left them as is.\r\n\r\nOn pages 29 and 30, there are two varieties both called Haas. I've left\r\nthem as is.\r\n\r\nChanged 'greet' to 'great' on page 40: \"on a great variety of soils\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'Average' to 'Acreage' in table on page 42 to be consistent with\r\nother tables: \"Acreage, about\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'caterpiller' to 'caterpillar' on page 43: \"canker-worm and\r\ntent-caterpillar\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'successfuly' to 'successfully' on page 43: \"never successfully\r\ncombated\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'Kanses' to 'Kansas' on page 48: \"suitable for Kansas\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'togther' to 'together' on page 48: \"two furrows together\".\r\n\r\nLeft 'oak plant sixteen feet long' on page 52, although I suspect the\r\nauthor meant 'plank'.\r\n\r\nChanged 'wifh' to 'with' on page 58: \"with a knife\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'occassion' to 'occasion' on page 63: \"had no occasion\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'caterpiller' to 'caterpillar' on page 66: \"canker-worm,\r\ntent-caterpillar, bud moth\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'of' on page 67: \"amount of water\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'staight' to 'straight' on page 69: \"set them up straight\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'paris' to 'Paris' on page 72: \"London purple and Paris green\".\r\n\r\nChanged comma to period on page 75: \"planted two rods apart around\r\norchard.\"\r\n\r\nChanged 'Domine' to 'Dominie' on page 75: \"Early Harvest and Dominie\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'spliting' to 'splitting' on page 76: \"keep from splitting\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'caterpillas' to 'caterpillars' on page 81: \"the [tent]\r\ncaterpillars\".\r\n\r\nChanged comma to period on page 81: \"Winesap and Rawle's Janet keep\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nAdded comma on page 82: \"Westmoreland, Pottawatomie county\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'mixure' to 'mixture' on page 86: \"with Bordeaux mixture\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'empyting' to 'emptying' on page 89: \"emptying into bushel\r\nboxes\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra period at end of sentence on page 93: \"with London\r\npurple.\"\r\n\r\nChanged 'fell' to 'fall' on page 94: \"fall web-worm\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'the' on page 102: \"all the way down\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'out' on page 104: \"twenty out of twenty-four\".\r\n\r\nLeft the text \"I plant potatoes or sweet corn in a bearing orchard\" on\r\npage 116, although it seems more likely that \"non-bearing\" was intended.\r\n\r\nChanged 'filed' to 'filled' on page 122: \"filled with sweet water\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'a' between 'I' and 'plow' on page 124: \"I plow\r\nshallow\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'stable-litter' to 'stable litter' on page 129: \"with stable\r\nlitter\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'north-east' to 'northeast' on page 129 for spelling\r\nconsistency: \"a northeast slope\".\r\n\r\nRemoved repeated word 'for' on page 141: \"wind does it for me\".\r\n\r\nChanged period to semi-colon on page 143: \"plant nothing;\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'nor' to 'not' on page 143: \"Do not spray\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'caterpiller' to 'caterpillar' on page 144: \"tent-caterpillar\r\nand borers\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra hyphen after 'in' on page 146: \"in the orchard\".\r\n\r\nChanged comma to period to end sentence on page 155: \"in the order\r\nnamed.\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'Tomkins' to 'Tompkins' on page 155: \"King of Tompkins County\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'thing' to 'think' on page 164: \"think it advisable\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'culivator' to 'cultivator' on page 167: \"plow and cultivator\".\r\n\r\nChanged comma to period to end sentence on page 167: \"they thin\r\nthemselves.\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'windbreake' to 'windbreaks' on page 170: \"windbreaks are\r\nessential\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'nothwest' to 'northwest' on page 170: \"northwest aspect\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'two-year old' to 'two-year-old' on page 171: \"two-year-old\r\nmedium-sized trees\". Also on page 174: \"prefer two-year-old trees\".\r\n\r\nChanged comma to period to end sentence on page 176: \"repack stored\r\napples before marketing.\".\r\n\r\nInserted hyphen on page 179: \"codling-moth\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'yearss' to 'years' on page 184: \"eighteen years\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'a' on page 187: \"a couple of inches\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'cornstalks' to 'corn-stalks' on page 188 to be consistent with\r\nall other spellings: \"the ever-present corn-stalks\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'of' on page 189: \"part of the risk\".\r\n\r\nChanged garbled text 'o beet nasily see' to 'to be easily seen' on page\r\n196.\r\n\r\nChanged 'figures 3 and 5' to 'figures 3 _a_ and _b_' on page 204 to\r\nmatch up with the figures.\r\n\r\nThe caption for figure 4 on page 205 is missing the explanation for\r\nfigures c and d.\r\n\r\nChanged 'coccoon' to 'cocoon' on page 206: \"spin a cocoon\".\r\n\r\nRemoved extra word 'a' between 'one' and 'at' on page 220: \"one at time\r\ninto the jar\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'Domine' to 'Dominie' on page 225: \"Dominie, 39\".\r\n\r\nChanged 'Burrto' to 'Burrton' on page 229: \"Saltzman, A. J., Burrton\".\r\n\r\nKept both 'leaf-crumpler' and 'leaf-crumbler', though I suspect the\r\ndifferent writers meant the same insect.\r\n\r\nKept inconsistent spelling of 'Axelton' and 'Axleton'; 'bagworm' and\r\n'bag-worm'; 'Belleflower', 'Bell-flower' and 'Bellflower'; 'Christensen'\r\nand 'Christenson'; 'Domony' and 'Domoney'; 'Gennetting', 'Genneting' and\r\n'Gennettan'; \"Grimes'\" and \"Grimes's\"; 'jackknife' and 'jack-knife';\r\n'Lovett' and 'Lovette'; 'McCullogh' and 'McCullough'; 'Morganville' and\r\n'Morgantown'; 'Nonsuch' and 'Nonesuch'; 'Pippin' and 'Pippen';\r\n'pollenizer' and 'pollinator'; 'round-headed' and 'roundheaded';\r\n'Sayles' and 'Sales'; 'soap-suds' and 'soapsuds'; 'Spitzenburg' and\r\n'Spitzenberg'; 'Vandevere' and 'Vandervere'.\r\n\r\nFor ASCII version, replaced Section Sign (U+00A7) with 'Sect.'; replaced\r\nMultiplication Sign (U+00D7) with lowercase 'x'; replaced Latin Small\r\nLetter AE (U+00E6) with 'ae'; and replaced Latin Small Letter E With\r\nAcute (U+00E9) with 'e'.",
