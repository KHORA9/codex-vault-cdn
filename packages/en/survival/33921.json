This essay is prompted first,\r\nbecause much of the cacao grown here is of such excellent quality as\r\nto induce keen rivalry among buyers to procure it at an advance of\r\nquite 50 per cent over the common export grades of the Java bean,\r\nnotwithstanding the failure on the part of the local grower to\r\n\"process\" or cure the product in any way; second, because in parts\r\nof Mindanao and Negros, despite ill treatment or no treatment, the\r\nplant exhibits a luxuriance of growth and wealth of productiveness\r\nthat demonstrates its entire fitness for those regions and leads us\r\nto believe in the successful extension of its propagation throughout\r\nthese Islands; and lastly because of the repeated calls upon the Chief\r\nof the Agricultural Bureau for literature or information bearing upon\r\nthis important horticultural industry.\r\n\r\nThe importance of cacao-growing in the Philippines can hardly be\r\noverestimated. Recent statistics place the world's demand for cacao\r\n(exclusive of local consumption) at 200,000,000 pounds, valued at\r\nmore than $30,000,000 gold.\r\n\r\nThere is little danger of overproduction and consequent low prices\r\nfor very many years to come. So far as known, the areas where cacao\r\nprospers in the great equatorial zone are small, and the opening and\r\ndevelopment of suitable regions has altogether failed to keep pace\r\nwith the demand.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography of cacao is rather limited, and some of the best\r\npublications, [2] being in French, are unavailable to many. The leading\r\nEnglish treatise, by Professor Hart, [3] admirable in many respects,\r\ndeals mainly with conditions in Trinidad, West Indies, and is fatally\r\ndefective, if not misleading, on the all-important question of pruning.\r\n\r\nThe life history of the cacao, its botany, chemistry, and statistics\r\nare replete with interest, and will, perhaps, be treated in a future\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,\r\n\r\n        Wm. S. Lyon,\r\n        In Charge of Seed and Plant Introduction.\r\n\r\n        Hon. F. Lamson-Scribner,\r\n        Chief of the Insular Bureau of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCACAO CULTURE IN THE PHILIPPINES.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCacao in cultivation exists nearly everywhere in the Archipelago. I\r\nhave observed it in several provinces of Luzon, in Mindanao, Joló,\r\nBasilan, Panay, and Negros, and have well-verified assurances of its\r\npresence in Cebú, Bohol, and Masbate, and it is altogether reasonable\r\nto predicate its existence upon all the larger islands anywhere under\r\nan elevation of 1,000 or possibly 1,200 meters. Nevertheless, in many\r\nlocalities the condition of the plants is such as not to justify the\r\ngeneral extension of cacao cultivation into all regions. The presence\r\nof cacao in a given locality is an interesting fact, furnishing a\r\nuseful guide for investigation and agricultural experimentation, but,\r\nas the purpose of this paper is to deal with cacao growing from a\r\ncommercial standpoint, it is well to state that wherever reference is\r\nmade to the growth, requirements, habits, or cultural treatment of the\r\nplant the commercial aspect is alone considered. As an illustration,\r\nattention is called to the statement made elsewhere, that \"cacao exacts\r\na minimum temperature of 18°\"; although, as is perfectly well known\r\nto the writer, its fruit has sometimes matured where the recorded\r\ntemperatures have fallen as low as 10°. There is much to be learned\r\nhere by experimentation, for as yet the cultivation is primitive\r\nin the extreme, pruning of any kind rudimentary or negative, and\r\n\"treatment\" of the nut altogether unknown.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in cacao-producing countries its cultivation has long passed\r\nthe experimental stage, and the practices that govern the management\r\nof a well-ordered cacao plantation are as clearly defined as those\r\nof an orange grove in Florida or a vineyard in California.\r\n\r\nIn widely scattered localities the close observer will find many\r\nyoung trees that in vigor, color, and general health leave nothing\r\nto be desired, but before making final selection for a plantation he\r\nshould inspect trees of larger growth for evidences of \"die back\" of\r\nthe branches. If \"die back\" is present, superficial examination will\r\ngenerally determine if it is caused by neglect or by the attacks\r\nof insects. If not caused by neglect or insect attacks, he may\r\nassume that some primary essential to the continued and successful\r\ncultivation of the tree is wanting and that the location is unsuited\r\nto profitable plantations.\r\n\r\nWith due regard to these preliminary precautions and a close\r\noversight of every subsequent operation, there is no reason why the\r\ngrowing of cacao may not ultimately become one of the most profitable\r\nhorticultural enterprises that can engage the attention of planters\r\nin this Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is customary, when writing of any crop culture, to give precedence\r\nto site and soil, but in the case of cacao these considerations are\r\nof secondary importance, and while none of the minor operations of\r\nplanting, pruning, cultivation, and fertilizing may be overlooked,\r\nthey are all outweighed by the single essential--climate.\r\n\r\nIn general, a state of atmospheric saturation keeps pace with heavy\r\nrainfall, and for that reason we may successfully look for the highest\r\nrelative humidity upon the eastern shores of the Archipelago, where\r\nthe rainfall is more uniformly distributed over the whole year,\r\nthan upon the west.\r\n\r\nThere are places where the conditions are so peculiar as to challenge\r\nespecial inquiry. We find on the peninsula of Zamboanga a recorded\r\nannual mean rainfall of only 888 mm., and yet cacao (unirrigated)\r\nexhibits exceptional thrift and vigor. It is true that this rain is\r\nso evenly distributed throughout the year that every drop becomes\r\navailable, yet the total rainfall is insufficient to account for\r\nthe very evident and abundant atmospheric humidity indicated by\r\nthe prosperous conditions of the cacao plantations. The explanation\r\nof this phenomenon, as made to me by the Rev. Father Algué, of the\r\nObservatory of Manila, is to the effect that strong equatorial ocean\r\ncurrents constantly prevail against southern Mindanao, and that their\r\ninfluence extend north nearly to the tenth degree of latitude. These\r\ncurrents, carrying their moisture-laden atmosphere, would naturally\r\naffect the whole of this narrow neck of land and influence as well\r\nsome of the western coast of Mindanao, and probably place it upon\r\nthe same favored hygrometric plane as the eastern coast, where the\r\nrainfall in some localities amounts to 4 meters a year.\r\n\r\nWhile 2,000 mm. of mean annual rainfall equably distributed is ample\r\nto achieve complete success, it seems almost impossible to injure\r\ncacao by excessive precipitation. It has been known to successfully\r\ntide over inundation of the whole stem up to the first branches for\r\na period covering nearly a month.\r\n\r\nIrrigation must be resorted to in cases of deficient or unevenly\r\ndistributed rainfall, and irrigation is always advantageous whenever\r\nthere is suspension of rain for a period of more than fifteen days.\r\n\r\nConcerning temperatures the best is that with an annual mean of 26°\r\nto 28°, with 20° as the mean minimum where any measure of success\r\nmay be expected. A mean temperature of over 30° is prejudicial to\r\ncacao growing.\r\n\r\nThe last but not least important of the atmospheric phenomena for\r\nour consideration are the winds. Cacao loves to \"steam and swelter in\r\nits own atmosphere\" and high winds are inimical, and even refreshing\r\nbreezes are incompatible, with the greatest success. As there are but\r\nfew large areas in these Islands that are exempt from one or other\r\nof our prevailing winds, the remedies that suggest themselves are:\r\nThe selection of small sheltered valleys where the prevailing winds\r\nare directly cut off by intervening hills or mountains; the plantation\r\nof only small groves in the open, and their frequent intersection by\r\nthe plantation of rapid growing trees; and, best of all, plantings\r\nmade in forest clearings, where the remaining forested lands will\r\nfurnish the needed protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is always desirable to select a site that is approximately level\r\nor with only enough fall to assure easy drainage. Such sites may\r\nbe planted symmetrically and are susceptible to the easiest and\r\nmost economical application of the many operations connected with\r\na plantation.\r\n\r\nProvided the region is well forested and therefore protected from\r\nsea breezes, the plantation may be carried very near to the coast,\r\nprovided the elevation is sufficient to assure the grove immunity from\r\nincursions of tide water, which, however much diluted, will speedily\r\ncause the death of the plants.\r\n\r\nExcavations should be made during the dry season to determine that\r\nwater does not stand within 1 1/2 meters of the surface, a more\r\nessential condition, however, when planting is made \"at stake\" than\r\nwhen nursery reared trees are planted.\r\n\r\nHillsides, when not too precipitous, frequently offer admirable shelter\r\nand desirable soils, but their use entails a rather more complicated\r\nsystem of drainage, to carry away storm water without land washing,\r\nand for the ready conversion of the same into irrigating ditches during\r\nthe dry season. Further, every operation involved must be performed\r\nby hand labor, and in the selection of such a site the planter must\r\nbe largely influenced by the quantity and cost of available labor.\r\n\r\nThe unexceptionable shelter, the humidity that prevails, and the\r\ninexhaustible supply of humus that is generally found in deep\r\nforest ravines frequently lead to their planting to cacao where\r\nthe slope is even as great as 45°. Such plantations, if done upon\r\na considerable commercial scale, involve engineering problems and\r\nthe careful terracing of each tree, and, except for a dearth of more\r\nsuitable locations, is a practice that has little to commend it to\r\nthe practical grower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther things being equal, preference should be given to a not too\r\ntenacious, clayey loam. Selection, in fact, may be quite successfully\r\nmade through the process of exclusion, and by eliminating all soils\r\nof a very light and sandy nature, or clays so tenacious that the\r\nsurface bakes and cracks while still too wet within 3 or 4 inches of\r\nthe surface to operate with farm tools. These excluded, still leave\r\na very wide range of silt, clay, and loam soils, most of which are\r\nsuitable to cacao culture.\r\n\r\nWhere properly protected from the wind a rocky soil, otherwise good,\r\nis not objectionable; in fact, such lands have the advantage of\r\npromoting good drainage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the plantation is made upon forest lands, it is necessary to\r\ncut and burn all underbrush, together with all timber trees other\r\nthan those designed for shade. If such shade trees are left (and the\r\nadvisability of leaving them will be discussed in the proper place),\r\nonly those of the pulse or bean family are to be recommended. It should\r\nalso be remembered that, owing in part to the close planting of cacao\r\nand in part to the fragility of its wood and its great susceptibility\r\nto damage resulting from wounds, subsequent removal of large shade\r\ntrees from the plantation is attended with difficulty and expense,\r\nand the planter should leave few shade trees to the hectare. Clearing\r\nthe land should be done during the dry season, and refuse burned in\r\nsitu, thereby conserving to the soil the potash salts so essential\r\nto the continued well-being of cacao.\r\n\r\nThe land should be deeply plowed, and, if possible, subsoiled as well,\r\nand then, pending the time of planting the orchard, it may be laid\r\ndown to corn, cotton, beans, or some forage plant. Preference should\r\nbe given to \"hoed crops,\" as it is essential to keep the surface in\r\nopen tilth, as well as to destroy all weeds.\r\n\r\nThe common practice in most cacao-growing countries is to simply dig\r\ndeep holes where the trees are to stand, and to give a light working\r\nto the rest of the surface just sufficient to produce the intermediate\r\ncrops. This custom is permissible only on slopes too steep for the\r\nsuccessful operation of a side hill plow, or where from lack of draft\r\nanimals all cultivation has to be done by hand.\r\n\r\nCacao roots deeply, and with relatively few superficial feeders,\r\nand the deeper the soil is worked the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number and size of the drains will depend upon the amount of\r\nrainfall, the contour of the land, and the natural absorbent character\r\nof the soil. In no case should the ditches be less than 1 meter wide\r\nand 60 cm. deep, and if loose stones are at hand the sloping sides\r\nmay be laid with them, which will materially protect them from washing\r\nby torrential rains.\r\n\r\nThese main drains should all be completed prior to planting. Connecting\r\nlaterals may be opened subsequently, as the necessities of further\r\ndrainage or future irrigation may demand; shallow furrows will\r\ngenerally answer for these laterals, and as their obliteration will\r\npractically follow every time cultivation is given, their construction\r\nmay be of the cheapest and most temporary nature. Owing to the\r\nnecessity of main drainage canals and the needful interplanting of\r\nshade plants between the rows of cacao, nothing is gained by laying off\r\nthe land for planting in what is called \"two ways,\" and all subsequent\r\nworking of the orchard will consequently be in one direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCacao, relatively to the size of the tree, may be planted very\r\nclosely. We have stated that it rejoices in a close, moisture-laden\r\natmosphere, and this permits of a closer planting than would be\r\nadmissible with any other orchard crop.\r\n\r\nIn very rich soil the strong-growing Forastero variety may be planted\r\n3.7 meters apart each way, or 745 trees to the hectare, and on lighter\r\nlands this, or the more dwarf-growing forms of Criollo, may be set\r\nas close as 3 meters or rather more than 1,000 trees to the hectare.\r\n\r\nThe rows should be very carefully lined out in one direction and\r\nstaked where the young plants are to be set, and then (a year before\r\nthe final planting) between each row of cacao a line of temporary\r\nshelter plants are to be planted. These should be planted in quincunx\r\norder, i. e., at the intersecting point of two lines drawn between\r\nthe diagonal corners of the square made by four cacaos set equidistant\r\neach way. This temporary shelter is indispensable for the protection\r\nof the young plantation from wind and sun.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal custom is to plant, for temporary shelter, suckers\r\nof fruiting bananas, but throughout the Visayas and in Southern Luzon\r\nI think abacá could be advantageously substituted. It is true that,\r\nas commonly grown, abacá does not make so rank a growth as some\r\nof the plantains, but if given the perfect tillage which the cacao\r\nplantation should receive, and moderately rich soils, abacá ought to\r\nfurnish all necessary shade. This temporary shade may be maintained\r\ntill the fourth or fifth year, when it is to be grubbed out and the\r\nstalks and stumps, which are rich in nitrogen, may be left to decay\r\nupon the ground. At present prices, the four or five crops which\r\nmay be secured from the temporary shelter plants ought to meet the\r\nexpenses of the entire plantation until it comes into bearing.\r\n\r\nIn the next step, every fourth tree in the fourth or fifth row\r\nof cacao may be omitted and its place filled by a permanent shade\r\ntree. The planting of shade trees or \"madre de cacao\" among the cacao\r\nhas been observed from time immemorial in all countries where the crop\r\nis grown, and the primary purpose of the planting has been for shade\r\nalone. Observing that these trees were almost invariably of the pulse\r\nor legume family, the writer, in the year 1892, raised the question,\r\nin the Proceedings of the Southern California Horticultural Society,\r\nthat the probable benefits derived were directly attributable to the\r\nabundant fertilizing microörganisms developed in the soil by these\r\nleguminous plants, rather than the mechanical protection they afforded\r\nfrom the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. O. F. Cook, of the United States Department of Agriculture,\r\nhowever, belongs the credit of publishing, in 1901, [4] a résumé of\r\nhis inquiries into the subject of the shades used for both the coffee\r\nand the cacao, and which fully confirmed the previous opinions that\r\nthe main benefit derived from these trees was their influence in\r\nmaintaining a constant supply of available nitrogen in the soil.\r\n\r\nThat cacao and its wild congenors naturally seek the shelter of\r\nwell-shaded forests is well established; but having seen trees in these\r\nIslands that were fully exposed at all times showing no evidences of\r\neither scald, burn, or sun spot, and in every respect the embodiment\r\nof vigor and health, we are fully justified in assuming that here the\r\nclimatic conditions are such as will permit of taking some reasonable\r\nliberties with this time-honored practice and supply needed nitrogen\r\nto the soil by the use of cheap and effective \"catch crops,\" such us\r\ncowpeas or soy beans.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, an Erythrina, known as \"dap-dap,\" is a favorite\r\nshade tree among native planters; the rain tree (Pithecolobium saman)\r\nis also occasionally used, and in one instance only have I seen a\r\ndeparture from the use of the Leguminosæ, and that in western Mindanao,\r\nthere is a shade plantation composed exclusively of Cananga odorata,\r\nlocally known as ilang-ilang.\r\n\r\nWhile not yet prepared to advocate the total exclusion of all shade\r\ntrees, I am prepared to recommend a shade tree, if shade trees there\r\nmust be, whose utility and unquestioned value has singularly escaped\r\nnotice. The tree in question, the Royal Poinciana (Poinciana regia),\r\nembodies all of the virtues that are ascribed to the best of the\r\npulse family, is easily procured, grows freely and rapidly from seed\r\nor cutting, furnishes a minimum of shade at all times, and, in these\r\nIslands, becomes almost leafless, at the season of maturity of the\r\nlargest cacao crop when the greatest sun exposure is desired.\r\n\r\nThe remaining preparatory work consists in the planting of intersecting\r\nwind breaks at intervals throughout the grove, and upon sides exposed\r\nto winds, or where a natural forest growth does not furnish such a\r\nshelter belt. Unless the plantation lies in a particularly protected\r\nvalley, no plantation, however large in the aggregate, should cover\r\nmore than 4 or 5 hectares unbroken by at least one row of wind-break\r\ntrees. Nothing that I know of can approach the mango for this\r\npurpose. It will hold in check the fiercest gale and give assurance\r\nto the grower that after any storm his cacao crop is still on the\r\ntrees and not on the ground, a prey to ants, mice, and other vermin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF VARIETIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of cacao in general cultivation may be referred to\r\nthree general types, the Criollo, Forastero, and Calabacillo; and\r\nof these, those that I have met in cultivation in the Archipelago\r\nare the first and second only. The Criollo is incomparably the\r\nfinest variety in general use, and may perhaps be most readily\r\ndistinguished by the inexperienced through the ripe but unfermented\r\nseed or almond, as it is often called. This, on breaking, is found\r\nto be whitish or yellowish-white, while the seeds of those in which\r\nthe Forastero or Calabacillo blood predominates are reddish, or, in\r\nthe case of Forastero, almost violet in color. For flavor, freedom\r\nfrom bitterness, facility in curing, and high commercial value,\r\nthe Criollo is everywhere conceded to be facile princeps.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in point of yield, vigor, freedom from disease,\r\nand compatibility to environment it is not to be compared with the\r\nothers. Nevertheless, where such perfect conditions exist as are\r\nfound in parts of Mindanao, I do not hesitate to urge the planting\r\nof Criollo. Elsewhere, or wherever the plantation is tentative or the\r\nconditions not very well known to the planter, the Forastero is to be\r\nrecommended. The former is commercially known as \"Caracas\" and \"old\r\nred Ceylon,\" and may be obtained from Ceylon dealers; and the latter,\r\nthe Forastero, or forms of it which have originated in the island,\r\ncan be procured from Java.\r\n\r\nIt seems not unlikely that the true Forastero may have been brought\r\nto these Islands from Acapulco, Mexico, two hundred and thirty-two\r\nyears ago, [5] as it was at that time the dominant kind grown in\r\nsoutheastern Mexico, and, if so, the place where the pure type would\r\nmost likely be found in these Islands would be in the Camarines,\r\nSouthern Luzon. Aside from the seed characters already given, Forastero\r\nis recognized by its larger, thicker, more abundant, and rather more\r\nabruptly pointed fruit than Criollo, and its coarse leaves which are\r\nfrom 22 to 50 cm. long by 7 to 13 cm. wide, dimensions nearly double\r\nthose reached by the Criollo or Calabacillo varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING.\r\n\r\nPlanting may be done \"at stake\" or from the nursery. For the unskilled\r\nor inexperienced planter, who has means at hand to defray the greater\r\ncost, planting \"at stake\" is perhaps to be recommended. This is no\r\nmore than the dropping and lightly covering, during the rainy season,\r\nof three or four seeds at the stake where the plant is to stand,\r\nprotecting the spot with a bit of banana leaf, left till the seeds\r\nhave sprouted, and subsequently pulling out all but the one strongest\r\nand thriftiest plant.\r\n\r\nThe contingencies to be met by this system are many. The enemies of\r\nthe cacao seed are legion. Drought, birds, worms, ants, beetles, mice,\r\nand rats will all contribute their quota to prevent a good \"stand\"\r\nand entail the necessity of repeated plantings. Success by planting\r\n\"at stake\" is so doubtful that it is rarely followed by experienced\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nThe consequent alternative lies in rearing seedlings in seed beds that\r\nare under immediate control, and, when the plants are of sufficient\r\nsize, in transplanting them to their proper sites in the orchard. In\r\nview of the remarkable short-lived vitality of the cacao seed, it is\r\nin every way advisable that the untrained grower procure his plants\r\nfrom professional nurserymen, or, if this resource is lacking, that he\r\nimport the young plants in Wardian cases from some of the many firms\r\nabroad who make a specialty of preparing them for foreign markets.\r\n\r\nBoth of these expedients failing, then it is advised that the seeds\r\nbe sown one by one in small pots, or, if these are not procurable,\r\nin small bamboo tubes, and, for the sake of uniform moisture, plunge\r\nthem to their rims in any free, light soil in a well-shaded easily\r\nprotected spot where they may be carefully watered. In three to six\r\nmonths (according to growth) the tube with its included plant may be\r\nplanted in the open field, when the former will speedily decompose\r\nand the growth of the cacao proceed without check or injury.\r\n\r\nAt best, all of the above suggested methods are but crude expedients\r\nto replace the more workmanlike, expeditious, and satisfactory process\r\nof planting the conventional nursery grown stock. There is nothing\r\nmore difficult in the rearing of cacao seedlings than in growing any\r\nother evergreen fruit tree. Briefly stated, it is only the finding\r\nof a well-prepared, well-shaded seed bed and sowing the seeds in rows\r\nor drills, and, when the seedlings are of proper size, in lifting and\r\ntransferring them to the plantation. But in actual practice there are\r\nmany details calling for the exercise of trained judgment from the\r\npreparation of the seed bed down to the final process of \"hardening\r\noff,\" concerning which the reader is referred to the many available\r\ntext-books on general nursery management.\r\n\r\nIt may be said for the benefit of those unable to adopt more scientific\r\nmethods: Let the seed bed be selected in a well-shaded spot, and, if\r\npossible, upon a rather stiff, plastic, but well-drained soil. After\r\nthis is well broken up and made smooth, broadcast over all 3 or 4\r\ninches of well-decomposed leaf mold mixed with sand, and in this sow\r\nthe seed in furrows about 1 inch deep. This sowing should be made\r\nduring the dry season, not only to avoid the beating and washing\r\nof violent storms but to have the nursery plants of proper size for\r\nplanting at the opening of the rainy season. The seed bed should be\r\naccessible to water, in order that it may be conveniently watered by\r\nfrequent sprinklings throughout the dry season.\r\n\r\nThe rich top dressing will stimulate the early growth of the seedling,\r\nand when its roots enter the heavier soil below it will encourage a\r\nstocky growth. Four or five months later the roots will be so well\r\nestablished in the stiffer soil that if lifted carefully each plant\r\nmay be secured with a ball of earth about its roots, placed in a tray\r\nor basket, and in this way carried intact to the field. Plants thus\r\nreared give to the inexperienced an assurance of success not always\r\nobtained by the trained or veteran planter of bare rooted subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlanters are united in the opinion that pruning, cutting, or in any\r\nway lacerating the roots is injurious to the cacao, and in deference\r\nto this opinion all cultivation close to the tree should be done with\r\na harrow-tooth cultivator, or shallow scarifier. All intermediate\r\ncultivation should be deep and thorough, whenever the mechanical\r\ncondition of the soil will permit it. A plant stunted in youth will\r\nnever make a prolific tree; early and continuous growth can only be\r\nsecured by deep and thorough cultivation.\r\n\r\nOf even more consideration than an occasional root cutting is any\r\ninjury, however small, to the tree stem, and on this account every\r\nprecaution should be taken to protect the trees from accidental injury\r\nwhen plowing or cultivating. The whiffletree of the plow or cultivator\r\nused should be carefully fendered with rubber or a soft woolen packing\r\nthat will effectually guard against the carelessness of workmen. Wounds\r\nin the bark or stem offer an inviting field for the entry of insects\r\nor the spores of fungi, and are, furthermore, apt to be overlooked\r\nuntil the injury becomes deep seated and sometimes beyond repair.\r\n\r\nWith the gradual extension of root development, cultivation will\r\nbe reduced to a narrow strip between the rows once occupied by the\r\nplantain or the abacá, but, to the very last, the maintenance of the\r\nproper soil conditions should be observed by at least one good annual\r\nplowing and by as many superficial cultivations as the growth of the\r\ntrees and the mechanical state of the land will admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen left to its own resources the cacao will fruit for an almost\r\nindefinite time. When well and strenuously grown it will bear much more\r\nabundant fruit from its fifth to its twenty-fifth year, and by a simple\r\nprocess of renewal can be made productive for a much longer time.\r\n\r\nA necessary factor to this result is an annual pruning upon strictly\r\nscientific lines. The underlying principle involved is, primarily,\r\nthe fact that the cacao bears its crop directly upon the main branches\r\nand trunk, and not upon spurs or twigs; secondly, that wood under\r\nthree years is rarely fruitful, and that only upon stems or branches\r\nof five years or upward does the maximum fruitfulness occur; that the\r\nseat of inflorescence is directly over the axil of a fallen leaf, from\r\nwhence the flowers are born at irregular times throughout the year.\r\n\r\nWith this necessary, fundamental information as a basis of operations,\r\nthe rational system of pruning that suggests itself is the maintenance\r\nof as large an extension at all times of straight, well-grown mature\r\nwood and the perfecting of that by the early and frequent removal\r\nof all limbs or branches that the form of the tree does not admit of\r\ncarrying without overcrowding.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that this extension of the branch system should be\r\nlateral rather than vertical, for the greater facility with which\r\nfruit may be plucked and possible insect enemies fought; and on this\r\naccount the leading growths should be stopped when a convenient height\r\nhas been attained.\r\n\r\nWhen well grown and without accident to its leader, the cacao will\r\nnaturally branch at from 1 to 1.4 meters from the ground. These\r\nprimary branches are mostly three to five in number, and all in\r\nexcess of three should be removed as soon as selection can be made\r\nof three strongest that are as nearly equidistant from each other\r\nas may be. When these branches are from 80 cm. to 1 meter long, and\r\npreferably the shorter distance, they are to be stopped by pinching\r\nthe extremities. This will cause them and the main stem as well to\r\n\"break,\" i. e., to branch in many places.\r\n\r\nAt this point the vigilance and judgment of the planter are called\r\ninto greater play. These secondary branches are, in turn, all to\r\nbe reduced as were the primary ones, and their selection can not be\r\nmade in a symmetrical whorl, for the habit of the tree does not admit\r\nof it, and selection of the three should be made with reference to\r\ntheir future extension, that the interior of the tree should not be\r\novercrowded and that such outer branches be retained as shall fairly\r\nmaintain the equilibrium of the crown.\r\n\r\nThis will complete the third year and the formative stage of the\r\nplant. Subsequent prunings will be conducted on the same lines, with\r\nthe modification that when the secondary branches are again cut back,\r\nthe room in the head of the tree will rarely admit of more than one,\r\nat most two, tertiary branches being allowed to remain. When these\r\nare grown to an extent that brings the total height of the tree\r\nto 3 or 4 meters, they should be cut back annually, at the close\r\nof the dry season. Such minor operations as the removal of thin,\r\nwiry, or hide-bound growths and all suckers suggest themselves to\r\nevery horticulturist, whether he be experienced in cacao growing\r\nor not. When a tree is exhausted by overbearing, or has originally\r\nbeen so ill formed that it is not productive, a strong sucker or\r\n\"gourmand\" springing from near the ground may be encouraged to grow. By\r\ndistributing the pruning over two or three periods, in one year the\r\nold tree can be entirely removed and its place substituted by the\r\n\"gourmand.\" During the third year flowers will be abundant and some\r\nfruit will set, but it is advisable to remove it while small and\r\npermit all of the energy of the plant to be expended in wood making.\r\n\r\nFrom what we know of its flowering habit, it is obvious that every\r\noperation connected with the handling or pruning of a cacao, should\r\nbe conducted with extreme care; to see that the bark is never injured\r\nabout the old leaf scars, for to just the extent it is so injured is\r\nthe fruit-bearing area curtailed. Further, no pruning cut should ever\r\nbe inflicted, except with the sharpest of knives and saws, and the use\r\nof shears, that always bruise to some extent, is to be avoided. All\r\nthe rules that are laid down for the guidance of the pruning of most\r\norchard trees in regard to clean cuts, sloping cuts, and the covering\r\nof large wounds with tar or resin apply with fourfold force to the\r\ncacao. Its wood is remarkably spongy and an easy prey to the enemies\r\never lying in wait to attack it, and the surest remedies for disease\r\nare preventive ones, and by the maintenance of the bark of the tree\r\nat all times in the sound condition, we are assured that it is best\r\nqualified to resist invasion. Of the great number of worm-riddled\r\ntrees to be seen in the Archipelago, it is easy in every case to\r\ntrace the cause to the neglect and brutal treatment which left them\r\nin a condition to invite the attacks of disease of every kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ripening period of cacao generally occurs at two seasons of the\r\nyear, but in these islands the most abundant crop is obtained at about\r\nthe commencement of the dry season, and the fruits continue to ripen\r\nfor two months or longer. The time of its approaching maturity is\r\neasily recognized by the tyro by the unmistakable aroma of chocolate\r\nthat pervades the orchard at that period, and by some of the pods\r\nturning reddish or yellow according to the variety.\r\n\r\nThe pods are attached by a very short stalk to the trunk of the tree,\r\nand those within reach of the hand are carefully cut with shears. Those\r\nhigher up are most safely removed with an extension American tree\r\npruner. A West Indian hook knife with a cutting edge above and below\r\nand mounted on a bamboo pole, if kept with the edges very sharp, does\r\nexcellently well, but should only be intrusted to the most careful\r\nworkmen. There is hardly a conceivable contingency to warrant the\r\nclimbing of a cacao tree. If it should occur, the person climbing\r\nshould go barefooted. As soon as the fruit, or so much of it as is\r\nwell ripened, has been gathered, it is thrown into heaps and should\r\nbe opened within twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe opening is done in a variety of ways, but the practice followed in\r\nSurinam would be an excellent one here if experienced labor was not at\r\ncommand. There, with a heavy knife or cutlass (bolo), they cut off the\r\nbase or stem end of the fruit and thereby expose the column to which\r\nthe seeds are attached, and then women and children, who free most of\r\nthe seeds, are able to draw out the entire seed mass intact. It is\r\nexceedingly important that the seeds are not wounded, and for that\r\nreason it is inexpedient to intrust the more expeditious method of\r\nhalving the fruit with a sharp knife to any but experienced workmen.\r\n\r\nThe process of curing that I have seen followed in these Islands is\r\nsimplicity itself. Two jars half filled with water are provided for\r\nthe cleaners, and as the seeds are detached from the pulp they are\r\nsorted and graded on the spot. Only those of large, uniform size,\r\nwell formed and thoroughly ripe, being thrown into one; deformed,\r\nsmall, and imperfectly matured seeds going to the other. In these\r\njars the seeds are allowed to stand in their own juice for a day,\r\nthen they are taken out, washed in fresh water, dried in the sun from\r\ntwo to four days, according to the weather, and the process from the\r\nFilipino standpoint is complete.\r\n\r\nMuch of the product thus obtained is singularly free from bitterness\r\nand of such excellent quality; as to be saleable at unusually high\r\nprices, and at the same time in such good demand that it is with\r\nsome hesitancy that the process of fermentation is recommended for\r\ngeneral use.\r\n\r\nBut it is also equally certain that localities in these Islands\r\nwill be planted to cacao where all the conditions that help to\r\nturn out an unrivaled natural product are by no means assured. For\r\nsuch places, where the rank-growing, more coarse-flavored, and\r\nbitter-fruited Forastero may produce exceptionally good crops,\r\nit will become incumbent on the planter to adopt some of the many\r\nmethods of fermentation, whereby he can correct the crudeness of the\r\nuntreated bean and receive a remunerative price for the \"processed\"\r\nor ameliorated product.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the Strickland method, or some modification of it, is\r\nthe best, and is now in general use on all considerable estates where\r\nthe harvest is 200 piculs or upward per annum, and its use probably\r\nassures a more uniform product than any of the ruder processes in\r\ncommon use by small proprietors.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be forgotten that the present planters in the\r\nPhilippines are all small proprietors, and that until such time as the\r\nmaturing of large plantations calls for the more elaborate apparatus\r\nof the Strickland pattern, some practice whereby the inferior crude\r\nbean may be economically and quickly converted into a marketable\r\nproduct can not be avoided. As simple and efficacious as any is that\r\nlargely pursued in some parts of Venezuela, where is produced the\r\nfamous Caracas cacao.\r\n\r\nThe beans and pulp are thrown into wooden vats that are pierced with\r\nholes sufficient to permit of the escape of the juice, for which\r\ntwenty-four hours suffices. The vat is then exposed to the sun for\r\nfive or six hours, and the beans, while still hot, are taken out,\r\nthrown into large heaps, and covered with blankets.\r\n\r\nThe next day they are returned to the box, subjected to a strong sun\r\nheat and again returned to the heap. This operation is repeated for\r\nseveral days, until the beans, by their bright chocolate color and\r\nsuppleness, indicate that they are cured. If, during the period of\r\nfermentation, rain is threatened or occurs, the beans are shoveled,\r\nstill hot, into bags and retained there until they can once more be\r\nexposed to the sun. Before the final bagging they are carefully hand\r\nrubbed in order to remove the adherent gums and fibrous matters that\r\ndid not pass off in the primary fermentation.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon, immediately after the beans have been fermented they\r\nare washed, and the universally high prices obtained by the Ceylon\r\nplanters make it desirable to reproduce here a brief résumé of their\r\nmethod. The fermentation is carried on under sheds, and the beans are\r\nheaped up in beds of 60 cm. to 1 meter in thickness upon a platform of\r\nparallel joists arranged to permit of the escape of the juices. This\r\nplatform is elevated from the ground and the whole heap is covered\r\nwith sacks or matting. The fermentation takes from five to seven days,\r\naccording to the heat of the atmosphere and the size of the heap,\r\nand whenever the temperature rises above 40° the mass is carefully\r\nturned over with wooden shovels.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the fermentation is completed the Ceylon planter\r\npasses the mass through repeated washings, and nothing remains but\r\nto dry the seed. This in Ceylon is very extensively done, in dryers\r\nof different kinds, some patterned after the American fruit dryer,\r\nsome in slowly rotating cylinders through the axis of which a powerful\r\nblast of hot air is driven.\r\n\r\nThe process of washing unquestionably diminishes somewhat the weight\r\nof the cured bean; for that reason the practice is not generally\r\nfollowed in other countries, but in the case of the Ceylon product\r\nit is one of the contributing factors to the high prices obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENEMIES AND DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonkeys, rats, and parrots are here and in all tropical countries\r\nthe subject of much complaint, and if the plantation is remote from\r\ntowns or in the forest, their depredations can only be held in check\r\nby the constant presence of well-armed hunter or watchman. Of the\r\nmore serious enemies with which we have to deal, pernicious insects\r\nand in particular those that attack the wood of the tree, everything\r\nhas yet to be learned.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles N. Banks, an accomplished entomologist, now stationed\r\nat Maao, Occidental Negros, is making a close study of the life\r\nhistory of the insect enemies of cacao, and through his researches\r\nit is hoped that much light will be thrown upon the whole subject and\r\nthat ways will be devised to overcome and prevent the depredations of\r\nthese insect pests. The most formidable insect that has so far been\r\nencountered is a beetle, which pierces and deposits its eggs within\r\nthe bark. When the worm hatches, it enters the wood and traverses it\r\nlongitudinally until it is ready to assume the mature or beetle state,\r\nwhen it comes to the surface and makes its escape. These worms will\r\nfrequently riddle an entire branch and even enter the trunk. The\r\napertures that the beetle makes for the laying of its eggs are so\r\nsmall--more minute than the head of a pin--that discovery and probing\r\nfor the worm with a fine wire is not as fruitful of results as has\r\nbeen claimed.\r\n\r\nOf one thing, however, we are positively assured, i. e., that the\r\nepoch of ripening of the cacao fruit is the time when its powerful\r\nfragrance serves to attract the greatest number of these beetles\r\nand many other noxious insects to the grove. This, too, is the\r\ntime when the most constant and abundant supply of labor is on the\r\nplantation and when vast numbers of these insects can be caught and\r\ndestroyed. The building of small fires at night in the groves, as\r\ncommonly practiced here and in many tropical countries, is attended\r\nwith some benefits. Lately, in India, this remedy has been subject\r\nto an improvement that gives promise of results which will in time\r\nminimize the ravages of insect pests. It is in placing powerful\r\nacetylene lights over broad, shallow vats of water overlaid with\r\nmineral  oil or petroleum. Some of these lamps now made under recent\r\npatents yield a light of dazzling brilliancy, and if well distributed\r\nwould doubtless lure millions of insects to their death. The cheap cost\r\nof the fuel also makes the remedy available for trial by every planter.\r\n\r\nThere is a small hemipterous insect which stings the fruit when about\r\ntwo-thirds grown, and deposits its eggs within. For this class of\r\ninsects M. A. Tonduz, who has issued publications on the diseases of\r\ncacao in Venezuela, recommends washing the fruit with salt water, and\r\nagainst the attacks of beetles in general by painting the tree stem and\r\nbranches with Bordeaux mixture, or with the vassiliére insecticide,\r\nof which the basis is a combination of whale-oil soap and petroleum\r\nsuspended in lime wash. There can be no possible virtue in the former,\r\nexcept as a preventive against possible fungous diseases; of the\r\nsanitive value of the latter we can also afford to be skeptical, as\r\nthe mechanical sealing of the borer's holes, and thereby cutting off\r\nthe air supply, would only result in driving the worm sooner to the\r\nsurface. The odor of petroleum and particularly of whale-oil soap is\r\nso repellent, however, to most insects that its prophylactic virtues\r\nwould undoubtedly be great.\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands appear to be so far singularly exempt from\r\nthe very many cryptogamic or fungous diseases, blights, mildews,\r\nrusts, and cankers that have played havoc with cacao-growing in many\r\ncountries. That we should enjoy continued immunity will depend greatly\r\nupon securing seeds or young plants only from noninfested districts or\r\nfrom reputable dealers, who will carefully disinfect any shipments,\r\nand to supplement this by a close microscopical examination upon\r\narrival and the immediate burning of any suspected shipments.\r\n\r\nAnother general precaution that will be taken by every planter who\r\naims to maintain the best condition in his orchard is the gathering\r\nand burning of all prunings or trimmings from the orchard, whether\r\nthey are diseased or not. Decaying wood of any kind is a field for\r\nspecial activity for insect life and fungous growth, and the sooner\r\nit is destroyed the better.\r\n\r\nOn this account it is customary in some countries to remove the fruit\r\npods from the field. But unless diseased, or unless they are to be\r\nreturned after the harvest, they should be buried upon the land for\r\ntheir manurial value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few cultivated crops that make less drain upon soil\r\nfertility than cacao, and few drafts upon the land are so easily and\r\ninexpensively returned. From an examination made of detailed analyses\r\nby many authors and covering many regions, it may be broadly stated\r\nthat an average crop of cacao in the most-favored districts is about\r\n9 piculs per hectare, and that of the three all-important elements of\r\nnitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, a total of slightly more than\r\n4.2 kilograms is removed in each picul of cured seeds harvested. These\r\n37 kilos of plant food that are annually taken from each hectare may\r\nbe roughly subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    18 kilos of nitrogen,\r\n                    10 kilos of potash,\r\n                     9 kilos of phosphoric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn this basis, after the plantation is in full bearing, we would have\r\nto make good with standard fertilizers each year for each hectare\r\nabout 220 kilos of nitrate of soda, or, if the plantation was shaded\r\nwith leguminous trees, only one-half that amount, or 110 kilos. Of\r\npotash salts, say the sulphate, only one-half that amount, or 55\r\nkilos, if the plantation was unshaded. If, however, it was shaded,\r\nas the leguminous trees are all heavy feeders of potash, we would\r\nhave to double the amount and use 110 kilos.\r\n\r\nIn any case, as fixed nitrogen always represents a cost quite double\r\nthat of potash, from an economical standpoint the planter is still\r\nthe gainer who supplies potash to the shade trees. There still remains\r\nphosphoric acid, which, in the form of the best superphosphate of lime,\r\nwould require 55 kilos for unshaded orchards, and about 70 if dap-dap,\r\nPionciana, or any leguminous tree was grown in the orchard. These\r\nthree ingredients may be thoroughly incorporated and used as a top\r\ndressing and lightly harrowed in about each tree.\r\n\r\nIf the commercial nitrates can not be readily obtained, then\r\nrecourse must be had to the sparing use of farm manures. Until the\r\nbearing age these may be used freely, but after that with caution and\r\ndiscrimination. Although I have seen trees here that have been bearing\r\ncontinuously for twenty-two years, I have been unable to find so much\r\nas one that to the knowledge of the oldest resident has ever been\r\nfertilized in any way, yet, notwithstanding our lack of knowledge of\r\nlocal conditions, it seems perfectly safe to predicate that liberal\r\nmanuring with stable manure or highly ammoniated fertilizers would\r\ninsure a rank, succulent growth that is always prejudicial to the best\r\nand heaviest fruit production. In this I am opposed to Professor Hart,\r\n[6] who seems to think that stable manures are those only that may\r\nbe used with a free hand.\r\n\r\nWe have many safe ways of applying nitrogen through the medium of\r\nvarious catch crops of pulse or beans, with the certainty that we\r\ncan never overload the soil with more than the adjacent tree roots\r\ncan take up and thoroughly assimilate. When the time comes that the\r\norchard so shades the ground that crops can no longer be grown between\r\nthe rows, then, in preference to stable manures I would recommend\r\ncotton-seed cake or \"poonac,\" the latter being always obtainable in\r\nthis Archipelago.\r\n\r\nWhile the most desirable form in which potash can be applied is in\r\nthe form of the sulphate, excellent results have been had with the\r\nuse of Kainit or Stassfurth salts, and as a still more available\r\nsubstitute, wood ashes is suggested. When forest lands are near,\r\nthe underbrush may be cut and burned in a clearing or wherever it\r\nmay be done without detriment to the standing timber, and the ashes\r\nscattered in the orchard before they have been leached by rains. The\r\nremaining essential of phosphoric acid in the form of superphosphates\r\nwill for some years to come necessarily be the subject of direct\r\nimportation. In the cheap form of phosphate slag it is reported to\r\nhave been used with great success in both Grenada and British Guiana,\r\nand would be well worthy of trial here.\r\n\r\nLands very rich in humus, as some of our forest valleys are,\r\nundoubtedly carry ample nitrogenous elements of fertility to maintain\r\nthe trees at a high standard of growth for many years, but provision\r\nis indispensable for a regular supply of potash and phosphoric acid\r\nas soon as the trees come into heavy bearing. It is to them and not\r\nto the nitrogen that we look for the formation of strong, stocky,\r\nwell-ripened wood capable of fruit bearing and for fruit that shall\r\nbe sound, highly flavored, and well matured.\r\n\r\nThe bearing life of such a tree will surely be healthfully prolonged\r\nfor many years beyond one constantly driven with highly stimulating\r\nfoods, and in the end amply repay the grower for the vigilance,\r\ntoil, and original expenditure of money necessary to maintaining a\r\nwell-grown and well-appointed cacao plantation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTAL NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Varieties.--Cacao is exclusively grown from seed, and it is only\r\nby careful selection of the most valuable trees that the planter\r\ncan hope to make the most profitable renewals or additions to his\r\nplantations. It is by this means that many excellent sorts are now\r\nin cultivation in different regions that have continued to vary from\r\nthe three original, common forms of Theobroma cacao, until now it is\r\na matter of some difficulty to differentiate them.\r\n\r\nResidence.--The conditions for living in the Philippines offer\r\npeculiar, it may be said unexampled, advantages to the planter of\r\ncacao. The climate as a whole is remarkably salubrious, and sites are\r\nto be found nearly everywhere for the estate buildings, sufficiently\r\nelevated to obviate the necessity of living near stagnant waters.\r\n\r\nMalarial fevers are relatively few, predacious animals unknown,\r\nand insects and reptiles prejudicial to human life or health\r\nextraordinarily few in number. In contrast to this we need only\r\ncall attention to the entire Caribbean coast of South America, where\r\nthe climate and soil conditions are such that the cacao comes to a\r\nsuperlative degree of perfection, and yet the limits of its further\r\nextension have probably been reached by the insuperable barrier of\r\na climate so insalubrious that the Caucasian's life is one endless\r\nconflict with disease, and when not engaged in active combat with some\r\nform of malarial poisoning his energies are concentrated upon battle\r\nwith the various insect or animal pests that make life a burden in\r\nsuch regions.\r\n\r\nNonresidence upon a cacao plantation is an equivalent term for ultimate\r\nfailure. Every operation demands the exercise of the observant\r\neye and the directing hand of a master, but there is no field of\r\nhorticultural effort that offers more assured reward, or that will\r\nmore richly repay close study and the application of methods wrought\r\nout as the sequence of those studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATED COST AND REVENUES DERIVED FROM A CACAO PLANTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEstimates of expenses in establishing a cacao farm in the Visayas\r\nand profits after the fifth year. The size of the farm selected is\r\n16 hectares, the amount of land prescribed by Congress of a single\r\npublic land entry. The cost of procuring such a tract of land\r\nis as yet undetermined and can not be reckoned in the following\r\ntables. The prices of the crop are estimated at 48 cents per kilo,\r\nwhich is the current price for the best grades of cacao in the world's\r\nmarkets. The yield per tree is given as 2 catties, or 1.25 kilos,\r\na fair and conservative estimate for a good tree, with little or\r\nno cultivation. The prices for unskilled labor are 25 per cent in\r\nadvance of the farm hand in the Visayan islands. No provision is\r\nmade for management or supervision, as the owner will, it is assumed,\r\nact as manager.\r\n\r\nCharges to capital account are given for the second, third, and fourth\r\nyear, but no current expenses are given, for other crops are to defray\r\noperating expenses until the cacao trees begin to bear.

4,500.00\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the tenth year there should be no increase in taxes or fertilizers,\r\nand a slight increase in yield, sufficient to bring the net profits\r\nof the estate to the approximate amount of $5,000. This would amount\r\nto a dividend of rather more than $312 per hectare, or its equivalent\r\nof about $126 per acre.\r\n\r\nThese tables further show original capitalization cost of nearly $90\r\nper acre, and from the ninth year annual operating expenses of rather\r\nmore than $60 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated, however, that the operating expenses are based\r\nupon a systematic and scientific management of the estate; while the\r\nreturns or income are based upon revenue from trees that are at the\r\ndisadvantage of being without culture of any kind, and, while I am\r\nof the opinion that the original cost per acre of the plantation, nor\r\nits current operating expenses may be much reduced below the figures\r\ngiven, I feel that there is a reasonable certainty that the crop\r\nproduct may be materially increased beyond the limit of two \"catties.\"\r\n\r\nIn Camerouns, Dr. Preuss, a close and well-trained observer, gives\r\nthe mean annual yield of trees of full-bearing age at 4.4 pounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Rousselot places the yield on the French Congo at the same\r\nfigure. In the Caroline Islands it reaches 5 pounds and in Surinam,\r\naccording to M. Nichols, the average at maturity is 6 1/2 pounds. In\r\nMindanao, I have been told, but do not vouch for the report, of\r\nmore than ten \"catties\" taken in one year from a single tree; and,\r\nas there are well-authenticated instances of record, of single trees\r\nhaving yielded as much as 30 pounds, I am not prepared to altogether\r\ndiscredit the Mindanao story.\r\n\r\nThe difference, however, between good returns and enormous profits\r\narising from cacao growing in the Philippines will be determined by\r\nthe amount of knowledge, experience, and energy that the planter is\r\ncapable of bringing to bear upon the culture in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A short introduction to cacao and its cultivation in the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\n[2] Le Cacaoyer, par Henri Jumelle.
