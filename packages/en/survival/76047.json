Its purpose is\r\nto promote a better understanding of the factors which influence prices\r\nof farm products and stimulate an intelligent interest in statistical\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\nAside from a rather small number of specialists at the larger terminal\r\nmarkets, few of the people who buy or sell farm products have any very\r\ndefinite ideas concerning the legitimate price-making forces. A better\r\nunderstanding of such forces by farmers generally should in itself\r\ngradually bring about prices which will approach more nearly cost of\r\nproduction, and tend to reduce the violent fluctuations above and below\r\nthe compensatory average.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the facts herein set forth should aid leaders of farm\r\norganizations to avoid costly mistakes which too often result from hasty\r\nand ill-considered action.\r\n\r\nWhile not written primarily for economists, I trust many of them may\r\nfind something of practical value in the matter herein. They may,\r\nperhaps, feel that at times I have not been as respectful as they would\r\nlike toward many of the ideas of the classical school, but I have no\r\napologies to offer on this score. In anticipation of possible criticism\r\nof my treatment of cost of production, I shall ask them to remember that\r\nI use “cost of production” as a ratio concept (if need be, a shifting\r\nratio) and not as a cost-accounting concept. I may say, also, that I\r\nhold to no particular philosophy of economics unless a very firm belief\r\nin the utility of thoro mathematical price studies might be considered\r\nas constituting the basis of a philosophy.\r\n\r\nWhile the book is frankly written from the farmer’s point of view, there\r\nis no bias whatsoever to the mathematics used, and it is believed that\r\nso far as it may influence opinion and practice, the results will in the\r\nlong run benefit both farm producer and city consumer.\r\n\r\nStudents who may take up this book for serious study will get the\r\ngreatest good from it by following prices of agricultural products from\r\nday to day and month to month, and noting when the relationship is\r\nnormal and when abnormal. In this way they will acquire habits of\r\nintelligent observation of price trends that should prove of very great\r\nvalue to them when they get into business for themselves.\r\n\r\nIf this book is used as a college text, it is hoped that it will be by\r\nclasses which are especially concerned in applying statistical laws to\r\nagricultural prices. Such classes should have free access to calculating\r\nmachines, multiplying tables, etc., and should make a serious effort to\r\nwork out various ratios and also to work out supply and demand laws for\r\nvarious farm products by means of correlation coefficients, lines of\r\nregression, etc. The tables given in the appendix should be of some\r\nvalue as a source of raw material. For further material, it is suggested\r\nthat the Year Books of the United States Department of Agriculture, the\r\nMonthly Crop Reporters of the Bureau of Crop Estimates, and the Reports\r\nof the Chicago Board of Trade be consulted. A good book on correlation\r\ncoefficients, etc., is Yule’s Theory of Statistics. The teacher of the\r\nsuggested class in agricultural price statistics should simplify the\r\nmathematics to mere method, not concerning himself or his pupils with\r\nthe theory back of it all. Wherever possible, the teacher should study\r\nvery carefully the January and April, 1919, volumes of The Review of\r\nEconomic Statistics, published by the Harvard University Press. The\r\nmethods as exemplified in these volumes can very profitably be applied\r\nto the field of agricultural prices.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement is made to Professors J. M. Evvard and E. G. Nourse, of\r\nthe Iowa State College, and to Professor F. A. Pearson, of the\r\nUniversity of Illinois, for criticisms and helpful suggestions.\r\n\r\n                                                       HENRY A.

The farmer visitor in Chicago, who has a few minutes to spare,\r\nfinds it very interesting to look down from the Chicago Board of Trade\r\ngalleries on the corn pit. For several minutes, the pit may be the\r\ndullest thing imaginable, and suddenly news will “break.” Perhaps it is\r\nthe month of August, and it has begun to rain in Nebraska. As a result,\r\ncertain operators are anxious to dispose of the corn for which they had\r\ncontracted. Perhaps it is 9:30 on another August morning, and the\r\ntemperature, even this early in the day, is 85 degrees, and the\r\nprospects are for hot winds sweeping Kansas and southwestern Iowa. Men\r\nwho have sold corn “short” a few days before, on the strength of local\r\nrains, are now thoroly scared, and rush into the pit to buy back before\r\nthe price runs up more than three or four cents.\r\n\r\nThe farmers sitting in the gallery, watching the speculators buy and\r\nsell “paper” corn, by shaking their fists and nodding their heads, feel\r\nthat the Board of Trade is a gambling institution. So firm is this\r\nconviction that several of our largest farmers’ organizations have gone\r\non record as being opposed to the speculative system as a method for\r\nregistering prices of farm products.\r\n\r\nSo far as the business world is concerned, the system of buying and\r\nselling future contracts employed by the Board of Trade is in the nature\r\nof risk insurance. A feed concern may have sold to farmers twenty\r\ncarloads of their feed at a price based on $1.20 corn. They have not\r\nbought this corn as yet, and do not have room to store it. They\r\ntherefore buy a contract for future delivery at $1.20, in order to\r\nprotect themselves against corn going up in the meantime. This feed\r\nconcern is in the manufacturing game; it can not afford to take a risk,\r\nand for that reason buys a future on the Board of Trade. When this feed\r\nconcern accepts the actual corn, it sells the contract. It may make or\r\nlose money on the purchase and sale of the contract, but in either event\r\nthe net result is that the actual corn cost $1.20 per bushel plus the\r\ncommission charge of a fraction of a cent per bushel.\r\n\r\nThe speculator takes the risk, and the spirit in which he approaches the\r\ngame is often the gambling spirit, pure and simple. But, like all shrewd\r\ngamblers, he takes his risks as shrewdly as possible, and after a time\r\nbecomes expert in judging the probable effects of weather, political\r\nnews, transportation difficulties, etc., on corn prices. And these\r\nfactors are more real than some of our agitators would have us believe.\r\n\r\nBut while speculators perform a real service to society, there is\r\nnothing angelic about them. They are concerned with a profit, not with\r\nservice. The professional speculator is generally either “long” or\r\n“short” of the market; that is, he has corn bought or sold for future\r\ndelivery. The man who has December corn bought for future delivery at\r\n$1.20 per bushel is hoping with all his energy that the corn crop is\r\nshort and price will therefore advance, that transportation difficulties\r\nwill materialize, that an unusual demand will spring up from Europe for\r\nfoodstuffs, that something will happen to send up the price. He is\r\nfavorable to the promulgation of any kind of news which will help him to\r\nsell his corn at a profit. While the Board of Trade has regulations\r\nagainst the dissemination of false news, nevertheless these men at times\r\nseem to be able to color the crop news very effectively. Situations\r\ndevelop where most of the professional speculators are on one side of\r\nthe market, and where they are apparently able to use propaganda to\r\nforce prices very rapidly either up or down, at the expense of the\r\namateur speculators.\r\n\r\nThe products most traded in on the Board of Trade are wheat, corn and\r\noats, and to a lesser extent the cured hog products, rib sides, lard,\r\nand mess pork. The smallest units traded in are 5,000 bushels of grain\r\nand 50,000 pounds of provisions. In the case of the grains, the\r\ncontracts most commonly traded in are contracts for delivery in\r\nDecember, May, July and September. In the case of the pork products, the\r\ncontracts most traded in are contracts for delivery in January, May,\r\nJuly and September. Before the war, trading in December corn customarily\r\nopened in the month of May. The price of December corn as quoted in May\r\nwas necessarily based on the supposition that the ensuing crop would be\r\na normal crop, neither greater nor less than the average. If there was\r\ncold, wet weather in May or June, the price advanced. If the weather was\r\nwarm and rather dry, the price declined slightly. However, as a general\r\nproposition, before the war, the price held practically steady during\r\nthe months of May and June. During July and August, however, corn values\r\non the Chicago market oscillated back and forth with rainfall and\r\ndrouth, registering the changes in marvelously delicate fashion.\r\nCustomarily, before the war, it took an average rainfall, in the seven\r\ngreat corn states, of about one and a quarter inches during ten days, to\r\nhold the price of December corn futures practically stationary. A\r\nrainfall of as much as one and three-quarters inches in a ten-day period\r\nduring July and August would ordinarily depress the price by several\r\ncents a bushel, whereas a ten-day period with no rainfall at all would\r\ncustomarily advance the price by eight or nine cents a bushel or even\r\nmore if the temperature was high.\r\n\r\nAnyone who studies these things is surprised at the accuracy with which\r\nthe market price before the war actually reflected crop conditions as\r\nthey changed from day to day. Since the war, it has been more difficult\r\nto measure the price-making forces. Political conditions in Europe even\r\nduring the months of July and August often have had as much influence as\r\nthe weather in determining the price of corn.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Trade has to do with both cash grain and future trading. So\r\nfar as prices are concerned, the cash market is supposed to be less\r\nsensitive than the market for futures. The business of the future market\r\nis to register changing conditions as promptly and accurately as\r\npossible. Occasionally, however, artificial situations develop. For\r\ninstance, in a year of a very good corn crop, a large number of\r\nspeculators may have sold December corn “short” at around $1.20 a\r\nbushel. At the time of the sale, they may have had every reason to\r\nbelieve that they could eventually buy the actual grain for less than\r\nthis price when the month of December finally arrived. Then gradually\r\ntransportation difficulties began to grow and bad weather came on, and\r\naltho there might be an enormous crop in the country, there would be\r\nvery little corn in Chicago. Then certain other speculators might go to\r\nwork buying large quantities of December corn futures, knowing that\r\nother men were “short” a long line of December corn at $1.20. These\r\nspeculators might not actually want the corn, but nevertheless, by\r\nplaying the technique of the market, might be able to create a “squeeze”\r\nand force the price of corn up to $1.50 a bushel before permitting the\r\n“shorts” to settle. And this might happen in spite of the fact that by\r\nJanuary 2d there might be enough actual corn coming into Chicago to\r\nenable cash corn to be sold as low as $1.20.\r\n\r\nThe object of this book is neither to praise nor condemn the speculative\r\nsystem as a method for registering prices of farm products. We are\r\npointing out the strong points in the present system. Idealistic social\r\nworkers, representatives of organized labor, and many farmers, would\r\nlike to do away with the speculative system of registering prices. They\r\nwould like to substitute therefor price-fixing legislation. These\r\npeople, as a rule, are densely ignorant of the legitimate price-making\r\nforces, and it is impossible that they should be able to shape a\r\nprice-registering machinery superior to that which we now have.[2]\r\n\r\nOne reason for the writing of this book is the belief that organized\r\nfarmers and organized labor, working in conjunction with certain\r\nidealists, will make an effort to modify our present price-registering\r\nsystem. We are heartily in sympathy with such an effort, for the\r\nspeculative system is far from perfect. But it is such a delicate system\r\nof registering prices that we believe that even the most virulent\r\nopponents should allow the system to run unchecked for a good many years\r\nyet, in order that they may study its functions more carefully. Here is\r\na great field of research for the economists, who for some unknown\r\nreason have failed to study Board of Trade prices during the past fifty\r\nyears as closely as they should.\r\n\r\nImprovement on our present system can be made only after a thoroly\r\nscientific and dispassionate study of its strength and weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THREE PRICE-MAKING FORCES\r\n\r\nThree forces are prominent in making agricultural prices—cost of\r\nproduction, supply and demand, and strategic considerations. Farmers and\r\nlaborers believe that cost of production should be the chief\r\nconsideration. Business men preach “supply and demand” as the great\r\nprice-making force, and in addition use strategic propaganda when it is\r\nto their advantage to do so.\r\n\r\nCost of production in the long run is on the average practically\r\nidentical with both the supply-and-demand price and the actual price. It\r\nis in the very nature of things that those producers who can not on the\r\naverage get cost of production will go out of business. In the case of\r\nthe hog business, it takes about three years for the average man to get\r\nin and out. Ten years, which is fully three times the “in and out”\r\ncycle, is “long run” in the hog business. A ten-year average of actual\r\nhog prices should therefore be approximately equal to a ten-year average\r\nof the cost-of-production price of hogs. As a matter of fact, we find\r\nthat the cost of production, as shown by the corn-hog ratio, is\r\npractically the same from one decade to the next. Decade after decade,\r\nthe corn-hog ratio has remained constant at eleven to twelve bushels of\r\nChicago corn per hundred pounds of Chicago hog ever since the Civil war.\r\nFarm management investigations indicate that for the average farmer this\r\nratio represents approximately cost of production. As a matter of fact,\r\nthis ratio is “cost of production” in the very truest sense of the term.\r\nThis ratio represents the reward necessary to keep enough farmers\r\nproducing hogs to satisfy the consuming demand, year in and year out.\r\nStated thus baldly and simply, we see how the cost of producing a\r\nhundred pounds of hog weight must in the long run average the same as\r\nthe “actual” price and also the “supply and demand” price. And yet hogs\r\nmay sell for a year or so for the value of fifteen bushels of corn, as\r\nthey did in 1866 and 1910, or they may sell for a year or so for the\r\nvalue of nine bushels of corn, as they did in 1908 and 1917. At any\r\ngiven time, the cost-of-production price is likely to be decidedly lower\r\nor higher than the actual price or the supply-and-demand price. It is\r\nonly on the average that cost of production becomes identical with the\r\nactual price.\r\n\r\nSupply-and-demand price departs from the cost-of-production price at any\r\ngiven time because of such things as unusual weather, accidents, etc.\r\nDry weather in July and August may cut the corn crop short, and as a\r\nresult temporarily increase the number of hogs marketed. Under such\r\nconditions, the packer buyers make no attempt to pay for the hogs the\r\nincreased price which the higher price of corn would warrant, but\r\ninstead buy as cheaply as they can, quoting in defense, “supply and\r\ndemand.”\r\n\r\nA business panic may come on, as in October of 1907, and as a result the\r\ndemand for meats of all kinds may shrink. Corn prices, the cost of\r\nproducing hogs, may stay up, as was the case in 1907–1908, but hog\r\nprices nevertheless are reduced. A study of the hog market for many\r\nyears past reveals the fact that the immediate price-making force is\r\n“supply and demand,” and that “cost of production” has no influence\r\nwhatever on prices except in the long swings.\r\n\r\nThe supply-and-demand theory of prices is well understood by nearly\r\nevery one. Supposedly, actual prices at any given moment represent an\r\nequilibrium of supply and demand. The next day larger supplies come in,\r\nand the demand remains unchanged; naturally the price declines to a\r\npoint where supply and demand are again equal. There is a presumption in\r\nthe minds of many people that supply and demand interact with almost\r\nmathematical accuracy to determine prices. In the long run, possibly\r\nthis is true. The day-by-day price, however, is as much a matter of\r\npsychology as mathematics.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a consideration of those more intangible price forces\r\nwhich may be grouped together under the head of strategy. In January and\r\nin August of 1919, we had excellent examples of the use of strategy as a\r\nprice-making force. In both months, certain powerful interests worked in\r\nconjunction with the newspapers to modify public psychology in the\r\ninterests of lower prices. Day after day, the lower price bombardment\r\nwas directed against the farmers by the daily press and the politicians.\r\nPrices declined in spite of the fact that the supply was greatly\r\ncurtailed and the potential demand was as great as ever. In the corn\r\nmarket, receipts were exceedingly light at Chicago during both price\r\nraids. Hog receipts in August of 1919, when prices dropped $5 per\r\nhundredweight, were the smallest of the year. But government officials\r\nconstantly talked about the vast army supply of bacon. As a matter of\r\nfact, the quantity of pork products put on the market by the government\r\nwas not enough to account for much of a drop in hog prices. But the\r\npublicity which went with the government announcements, combined with\r\ndetermined pressure on the speculative markets in this country and\r\nabroad, sufficed to lower prices tremendously in defiance of any\r\nmathematical expression of supply and demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Solid line shows exports from U. S. Dotted line, ocean freights from\r\n    New York to Liverpool. Ocean freights are low in summer when exports\r\n    are low, and high in the fall when exports are heavy.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is a strategy to the timing of a determined price drive. All\r\nfarmers know that such a drive may be expected in the fall of the year.\r\nA drive in the fall is partly normal as a result of the increased supply\r\nat that time, but oftentimes strategic. In the fall of 1865, following\r\nthe Civil war, there was a determined price drive, roughly corresponding\r\nto the price drive initiated in August of 1919. In both cases, strategic\r\nfactors were apparently paramount. Certainly, no mathematical\r\nformulation of the law of supply and demand could account for the price\r\nchanges which took place in 1865 and 1919.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Solid line, U. S. exports; dotted line, British exchange in U. S.\r\n    Dotted line is inverted to show how heavy exports and weak exchange\r\n    go together. Chart\r\n  is based on 1903–1913 conditions.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFarmers have discovered since 1914 that such disturbances as\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease, interrupted railroad service, and falling\r\nforeign exchange may influence prices without changing either potential\r\nsupply or potential demand. They have suspected the “interests” of\r\nmanipulating foreign exchange in the fall of the year to make lower\r\nprice for farm products. They have known that ocean freights have\r\ngenerally advanced in the fall of the year, to the detriment of farm\r\nproduct prices in the United States, and they have suspected that part\r\nof this advance in ocean freight rates was due to England trying to get\r\na large return on her shipping and at the same time buy her food more\r\ncheaply.\r\n\r\nThe two charts presented herewith indicate the normal seasonal trends,\r\nduring the decade preceding the war, of exports from the United States\r\nas related to British exchange, and to ocean freights from New York to\r\nLiverpool. It will be noted that United States prices must necessarily\r\nbe weakened in the fall of the year by weak British exchange and high\r\nocean freights.\r\n\r\nThe speculative price as set from day to day is sometimes a result of\r\ntechnical situations altogether apart from supply and demand.\r\nOrdinarily, the speculative price as represented by “futures” and the\r\ncash price move in sympathy, but occasionally a scared “short” finds the\r\nmarket oversold and bids up prices unduly in an effort to cover, or a\r\ntired “long” finds the market overbought and sends prices down unduly in\r\nan effort to sell. And occasionally there is manipulation—interests\r\nworking together to make the price temporarily higher or lower than a\r\nnormal working of supply and demand would justify. Sometimes the cash\r\nmarkets, following the lead of the speculative markets, may get out of\r\nline with ultimate supply-and-demand conditions for several months at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CRITICISM OF OUR PRICE-MAKING SYSTEM\r\n\r\nPrices of corn, hogs, etc., are determined chiefly by supply and demand,\r\ntogether with the occasional influence of strategic manipulation. The\r\nsystem as operated by the packers and Board of Trade speculators really\r\nreflected conditions before the war with remarkable accuracy. During the\r\nwar, so many extraordinary conditions were at work that it was\r\nimpossible to measure supply-and-demand conditions at all accurately,\r\nand it is impossible to say how efficiently the speculators did their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut speculators and packers, in so far as they set prices, are concerned\r\nsolely in making a profit for themselves. If, by manipulating the\r\nmarket, they can make a bigger profit than by trying to express\r\nsupply-and-demand conditions with mathematical exactitude, then they may\r\nbe expected to manipulate. The violence with which hog prices swing\r\nabove and below cost of production would suggest that the packers are\r\nconsciously endeavoring to send prices too low for a year or two, in\r\norder later to send them too high. They go into the low-price period\r\nwith a small amount of high-priced products on hand, and come out into\r\nthe higher level with a large quantity of low-price products. It would\r\nseem that by laying in a stock of hog products at the low point, they\r\nhope to profit later by an advance in price.\r\n\r\nIt is typical of supply and demand, as it makes prices of standard farm\r\nproducts, that a small crop sells for more than a large crop. A twenty\r\nper cent decrease in the supply raises the price more than twenty per\r\ncent, possibly thirty per cent, or even fifty per cent. Old Gregory\r\nKing, in the latter part of the Seventeenth century, recognized this\r\nprinciple when he stated:\r\n\r\n“We take it a defect in the harvest may raise the price of corn [wheat]\r\nin the following proportions:\r\n\r\n                  Defect.    Above the common rate.\r\n                  1 tenth  raises the price 3 tenths\r\n                  2 tenths raises the price 8 tenths\r\n                  3 tenths raises the price 16 tenths\r\n                  4 tenths raises the price 28 tenths\r\n\r\nModern statistical study indicates that this statement of King’s is\r\nsomewhat exaggerated, but undeniably the tendency exists among standard\r\nagricultural products for small crops to bring in a greater return than\r\nlarge crops. In other words, the demand for farm products is inelastic.\r\nThe ultimate consumer wants just so much of staple foods, no more, no\r\nless. If farmers raise more than so much, they must accept a\r\nconsiderable reduction in price; if they raise less, they can command an\r\nadvance out of all proportion to the shortage. The law of demand for\r\nstaple farm products being inelastic, small crops bring in a greater\r\nreturn than large crops.[3]\r\n\r\nThe classical economists, the people of _laissez faire_ persuasion,\r\naccept this condition as natural, as inevitable, and therefore\r\ndesirable. But is it desirable? The sharp price rise which comes as a\r\nshortage becomes apparent benefits those lucky producers who have\r\nsupplies on hand, and especially those keen speculators who first saw\r\nthe oncoming shortage and bought in anticipation. This sharp price rise\r\nmay overstimulate production. The high hog prices in 1909–1910\r\nstimulated the production of too many hogs, and when this increased\r\nproduction reached market, the price was $6.50 instead of the expected\r\n$8 to $10. And the low prices of 1911–1912 in turn begat the high prices\r\nof 1913–1914.\r\n\r\nThe question comes, Would it not be to the public interest if, in price\r\nmaking, more emphasis could be placed on cost of production and less on\r\nthe short-time working of the law of supply and demand? Prices should\r\nrise with a short crop, but not to such an extent as to make a short\r\ncrop more profitable than a normal crop. If a moderate rise in prices\r\nwill not sufficiently curtail demand, then the public should be educated\r\nto the fact that there has been a drouth, and that unless they curtail\r\ntheir demand, there will not be enough to go around. Of course, under\r\nour present _laissez faire_ attitude, every speculative business man\r\nwould take such a pronouncement as a “bull” statement, and the demand\r\nwould immediately increase instead of decrease. There is danger that any\r\nattempt to make cost of production the guiding factor in price\r\ndetermination will amount to close government supervision of storage,\r\nspeculation and similar market phenomena. The disadvantages of\r\ngovernment supervision are apparent to all who watched the Food\r\nAdministration at work during the war. The Food Administration performed\r\na hard job remarkably well, but farmers found that the officials were\r\nignorant of agriculture, and that, moreover, agricultural interests\r\ncould not expect a square deal except in so far as they were organized\r\nto compel a square deal, or except as the emergency itself compelled a\r\nsquare deal to insure continued production.\r\n\r\nIf farmers are to continue under the present _laissez faire_ system with\r\nsupply and demand, together with strategic manipulations, as the\r\nprice-making force, they must necessarily learn to play the game\r\nthemselves. They will find it necessary to practice sabotage in the same\r\nscientific, businesslike way as labor and capital. They will reduce the\r\nsize of their crops at strategic moments, because they know that small\r\ncrops ordinarily bring in a greater return than large crops. Of course,\r\nif farmers should practice sabotage in the same heartless, efficient way\r\nas labor and capital, our society will be imperiled. The burden of the\r\nsabotage practiced by labor and capital has been borne chiefly by the\r\nfarmer. When farmers also practice sabotage, labor and capital will be\r\nforced to come to an agreement with farmers on production and price\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nIs there not a possibility that capital, laborers and farmers, by\r\nplacing themselves in equally powerful bargaining positions, may come to\r\nsee the futility of sabotage as a price-sustaining force? Once farmers\r\nare able to meet the other classes of society on equal terms, all three\r\nclasses ought to unite on production as the source of profit, rather\r\nthan on clever bargaining. This involves close-knit organizations of\r\nboth farmers and laborers under the leadership of men well educated in\r\ngeneral economics, in strategic bargaining, and in production. There\r\nmust be men studying the system as a whole, men who perceive the\r\nlegitimate physical difficulties which our society faces. The labor\r\nleaders must come to see that there is a point beyond which labor can\r\nnot go in raising wages and reducing hours. Farm leaders must come to\r\nsee that there is a point beyond which farmers can not go in reducing\r\nacreage and raising prices. Business leaders must come to see that the\r\ncommon people will not stand for curtailment of production to two-thirds\r\nfactory capacity in order to secure abnormal profits, when by running\r\nthe factories to full capacity the business will give normal profits.\r\nThe best brains of all classes must unite in overcoming legitimate\r\nphysical handicaps, not in figuring out ways in which a specific class\r\nmay benefit at the expense of other classes. In the meantime, farmers\r\nmust learn to use sagacious sabotage as effectively as labor and\r\ncapital. Otherwise they will continue to be at the mercy of capital and\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best means of overcoming the food shortage resulting from\r\ndrouth? _Laissez faire_ economists and business men say: Let high prices\r\ncurtail demand and stimulate production. But this remedy is “locking the\r\nstable after the horse is stolen.” Is it practical to build government\r\nwarehouses to store wheat in years when the acre yield is more than\r\nfifteen bushels, and from which wheat may be drawn in years when the\r\nyield is less than thirteen bushels?\r\n\r\nNo scheme of this sort can be definitely laid out in advance. But\r\nstatistical science will soon reach a point where it should be possible\r\nto meet our physical handicaps in the way of drouth, floods and\r\naccident, in the spirit of doing what is best for society, instead of\r\nutilizing the crisis for individual or class profit.\r\n\r\nIf we are to continue our present complex society, we must educate our\r\nchildren very thoroly in social mathematics. Our problems are not only\r\nproblems of the spirit, but also of exact measurement. What is the fair\r\nprice for bacon? This involves the cost-of-production idea. Is bacon\r\nrelatively lower or higher than hogs? Are hogs relatively lower or\r\nhigher than corn? Is there a normal supply in the country? If bacon were\r\nlower in price, would the future supply be imperiled? Would an injustice\r\nbe done to farmers? If bacon were higher in price, would an undue profit\r\naccrue to the packers, or would the farmers be stimulated to produce too\r\nmany hogs a year from now?\r\n\r\nPossibly it will be wise for the government to provide funds to finance\r\na Price Publicity Committee, to be made up of economists appointed by\r\nour state universities and agricultural colleges. The duty of this\r\ncommission would be to make public week by week the relevant price\r\nfacts. They would point out which products are relatively high and which\r\nare relatively low, and issue index numbers of various kinds, in an\r\nendeavor to educate the public to fundamental price facts. The object of\r\nsuch a Price Publicity Committee will be to furnish such constant\r\npublicity that it will be difficult for any product to sell for any\r\nlength of time either above or below cost of production. And in saying\r\nthis we define cost-of-production price as that price which is necessary\r\nin the long run to keep enough producers in the business to satisfy the\r\ndemand. It is believed that adequate publicity will favor the prevailing\r\nof the long run cost-of-production price as opposed to the short run\r\nsupply-and-demand price.\r\n\r\nMen in whom the laborers of the country have faith should have an\r\nintimate, statistical knowledge of the supply and demand forces as they\r\nmake prices and as they make for the prosperity of laborers and society\r\nas a whole. Men in whom farmers have faith should have an intimate,\r\nstatistical knowledge of labor and business problems in order that they\r\nmay know approximately when labor and business are charging fair prices\r\nfor their services. Business men already have a fair statistical\r\nknowledge of farming and labor conditions, but they need an even more\r\nintimate knowledge, as well as a change of heart. They must learn to\r\noperate their businesses from the standpoint of greatest service and a\r\nfair profit, not from the standpoint of greatest profit. Those\r\nbusinesses which do not learn this may expect to be taken over either by\r\nthe government, organized labor, or organized farmers, if not in one\r\nway, then in another.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SUPPLY AND DEMAND\r\n\r\nBoth farmers and city consumers have expressed much dissatisfaction in\r\nrecent years with the methods of price determination as used by the\r\nboards of trade and packing houses. The representatives of the boards of\r\ntrade and packing houses have answered these complaints with the simple\r\nformula, “supply and demand.”\r\n\r\nDuring the war, many people announced that prices in the United States\r\nwere no longer the result of supply and demand. For a period of two and\r\na half years, wheat prices were held at approximately $2.20 a bushel, in\r\nspite of the fact that both supply and demand conditions were varying\r\nconstantly during this period, and in spite of the fact that under\r\nsupply-and-demand conditions as they ordinarily work, prices might have\r\nbeen expected to have gone as high as $4 and as low as $1.50, at\r\ndifferent times during this period of two and one-half years. Social\r\nworkers and others of idealistic temperament who have always been pained\r\nwith the rather heartless way in which the law of supply and demand has\r\nworked, were much pleased with the stabilized wheat price, and referred\r\nto it as an instance of the repeal of the law of supply and demand.\r\n\r\nOf course, the law of supply and demand never has been repealed, and\r\nnever will be repealed. Instead of trying to repeal it, we should try to\r\nsecure the best type of price-fixing machinery thru which this law may\r\nwork. Man has not repealed the law of gravitation, but has devised such\r\nmachines as automobiles, airplanes, etc., thru which he accomplishes his\r\npurposes notwithstanding.\r\n\r\nOur city friends who favor government attempts to repeal the law of\r\nsupply and demand and to fix uniform and relatively cheap prices should\r\ndirect their efforts toward the search for a new price-fixing machinery.\r\nFor arbitrary interference with this law invariably brings penalties in\r\nthe form of conditions which often are more severe than the condition\r\nwhich it was hoped to improve.\r\n\r\nWhat we should strive for rather is a better understanding of the law of\r\nsupply and demand, in the hope that we may be able to modify the\r\nseverity of its operation and thus avoid periods of feast and famine,\r\nwith their unreasonably low prices and unreasonably high prices.\r\n\r\nThousands of men in the corn belt, especially the leaders of the\r\norganized farmers, should be familiar with the normal, mathematical\r\nworking of the law of supply and demand. They should know not only when\r\nprices are lower than warranted by the supply, but just how much too\r\nlow. Exact measurement is necessary in order to perceive when unusual\r\nfactors are at work. The price indicated by a mathematical\r\ninterpretation of supply and demand may be $1.25 for corn, whereas the\r\nactual price, because of a purely speculative drive, may be only $1. It\r\nis wise to measure prices to some extent by purely mathematical\r\nconsiderations, in order that we may perceive more clearly when\r\nextraordinary forces are at work.\r\n\r\nAfter having arrived at a price based on a mathematical interpretation\r\nof supply and demand, the problem is to determine to what extent\r\nextraordinary forces are at work and to what extent it may be worth\r\nwhile to combat them by extraordinary measures. If corn is 15 cents a\r\nbushel below the mathematically justified price, will it be advisable\r\nfor farmers generally to hold their corn and cause a shortage at the\r\nterminal markets? Will it be advisable to put out newspaper propaganda\r\nshowing the public how the market price of corn is below cost of\r\nproduction, or put on an advertising campaign to increase the demand?\r\nThese matters of larger policy are mostly outside the field of\r\nmathematics. They are largely matters of strategy. How much bargaining\r\nforce do the farmers represent? To what extent will they follow\r\ndirections? At what season of the year is it best to strike?\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, a farmers’ drive for higher prices would best begin\r\nabout January 1st, and should reach its greatest intensity about March\r\n1st. After March 1st, seasonal scarcity begins, and no further\r\npropaganda is needed. A consumers’ drive for lower prices best begins\r\nabout August 15th, and reaches its greatest intensity about October\r\n15th. After October 15th the seasonal surplus, especially of corn and\r\nhogs, begins, and there is no further need for consumers to bring\r\nartificial propaganda to bear. It is interesting to note in this\r\nconnection that the “bear” campaign engineered by the governments of the\r\nworld in 1919 began in late July and continued until about October 15th,\r\nat which time the weight of the season’s marketings was sufficient to\r\nhold prices down without additional use of newspaper space.\r\n\r\nAfter a mathematical study of prices, the leaders of farm organizations,\r\nin so far as they attempt to influence prices, must consider the state\r\nof the export trade, rate of foreign exchange, ocean freights, world\r\ncrop conditions, business conditions at home and abroad, and, in fact,\r\nall the factors which the trained speculators take into account on the\r\nBoard of Trade. They must take all of these things into account, and yet\r\nbe able on occasion to act decisively. They must learn to play the game\r\nin the same fashion as a skillful whist player. They must not “overbid”\r\ntheir hand, but bid its full worth, and they must take all the tricks\r\nthey can.\r\n\r\nTo have even a fair chance of success in an effort of this sort, farmers\r\nmust set up a very strong statistical organization, in charge of a\r\nhighly competent staff of thoroly trustworthy experts. For farmers\r\nthemselves have neither the time nor the opportunity to secure the\r\ntraining necessary to enable them to acquire and assimilate the\r\ninformation needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CAN “PRICE” MAKE “SUPPLY AND DEMAND”?\r\n\r\nDissatisfied farmers and city consumers have been told often that\r\n“supply and demand” makes the price. Economists have backed up the Board\r\nof Trade people and the packers in making this assertion.\r\n\r\nBut is it not almost equally true to say that “price” makes the “supply\r\nand demand”? Is it not possible to set a price which, as can be\r\ndemonstrated mathematically, is out of line with the present supply and\r\ndemand, and thru this price to create new and unexpected\r\nsupply-and-demand conditions?\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable, for example, that oleomargarine might be sold for\r\nseveral years at a price below that warranted by supply and demand and\r\nequally below a price warranted by cost of production. It is conceivable\r\nthat the abnormally low price, without reducing the supply, would\r\nincrease the demand and result in the formation of the oleomargarine\r\nhabit among millions of people. And it is equally conceivable that later\r\non the price of oleomargarine might be increased more nearly to a parity\r\nwith butter, and that the oleomargarine eating public might continue the\r\noleomargarine, even tho it was underselling butter by only 10 cents a\r\npound, instead of the 15 cents a pound differential which was existing\r\nwhen the habit was formed.\r\n\r\nA low price may be used to create a demand, which will continue even\r\nafter the low price no longer exists. In like manner, a low price may be\r\nused to curtail the supply of the competing article. In the\r\nillustration, an artificially low price for oleomargarine might reduce\r\nthe demand for butter, thereby reducing the supply, and increase the\r\ndemand for oleomargarine, and this situation of a reduced supply of\r\nbutter and an increased supply of oleomargarine might continue, even tho\r\nthe price of oleomargarine were later raised to its customary\r\nrelationship with butter. Price may act as a cause and “supply and\r\ndemand” may be a result.\r\n\r\nIn open, competitive markets, “supply and demand” generally comes first\r\nand price follows after. Before the war, for instance, the dominating\r\nfactor in the corn market was the supply of corn, and during the months\r\nof July and August, when the new corn crop was being made, the price of\r\ncorn varied with almost mathematical accuracy with the rainfall and\r\ntemperature which were making the new corn crop. The demand for corn was\r\na fairly constant factor. The supply of corn was the price-making force.\r\n\r\nSince the war, corn prices have not been the result of “supply and\r\ndemand” in the sense that they were before the war. During 1919, price\r\noften came first in the corn market, and supply and demand followed\r\nafterward. For example, in January and February, 1919, corn prices broke\r\n20 cents a bushel, in spite of the fact that receipts at central markets\r\nwere decidedly below their customary level. Influential people had\r\npostulated the theory that the war was over, and that supply and demand,\r\nif given an opportunity, would operate to bring about a lower price\r\nlevel. They set a lower price level, but supply and demand refused to\r\noperate on the new level. The lower corn prices which prevailed during\r\nthe spring of 1919, however, probably had a very material effect on the\r\nacreage planted. At any rate, there was about four per cent less corn\r\nplanted in 1919 than in 1918.\r\n\r\nAccording to the customary view, when the supply is smaller than usual,\r\nthe price should be greater than usual, and vice versa. In the hog\r\nmarket this does not necessarily hold true. In November of 1907, hog\r\nprices were dropped with a terrific jerk, as a result of certain unusual\r\nconditions. The drop was so great that farmers refused to market their\r\nhogs, and receipts of hogs in November of 1907 were about one-third\r\nsmaller than in the ordinary November. The price of hogs was lower than\r\ncustomary by about one-fourth, and the supply of hogs marketed was less\r\nby about one-third. A similar situation prevailed in August of 1919.\r\nPrices dropped about $5 per hundredweight, or faster than ever before in\r\nhistory. Receipts also dropped, and much fewer hogs were received than\r\nin the ordinary August.\r\n\r\nIn both 1907 and 1919, the packers figured that the business world was\r\nso upset that to be on the safe side they would best buy their hogs\r\ncheaper than they had been buying them. Farmers were slow to realize\r\njust how great the disturbances had been in the business world, and\r\nfailed to understand that in a situation of this sort the packers could\r\nput thru their program for lower prices, in spite of reduced hog\r\nreceipts for a month or two. It is in the very nature of things that the\r\npackers can outlast the farmers at such a game. The packers know more\r\naccurately than the farmers the supply-and-demand conditions, and they\r\nknow that after a hog reaches two hundred pounds, it is only a question\r\nof weeks till the farmer will let him go, no matter what the price. It\r\nwill take an extraordinarily able farmers’ organization to beat the\r\npackers at this game, an organization which holds as its trump card\r\n“ultimate supply and demand.”\r\n\r\nPrices may make supply and demand, and supply and demand may make\r\nprices. First one has the lead, and then the other; they are constantly\r\nacting and reacting. Before the war, the relationship in some\r\ncommodities might be expressed with almost mathematical exactness, but\r\nthere were constant little departures. Since the war prices have much\r\nmore often taken the initiative than they did before the war. The\r\nresult, of course, is a more violently fluctuating condition of both\r\nsupply and demand.\r\n\r\nThe problem which farmers and city consumers should put to the Board of\r\nTrade people and the packers is: What are you doing to place prices at a\r\npoint which will result in a more uniform supply and a more uniform\r\ndemand?\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COST OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe common man prefers to approach the question of price not from the\r\nstandpoint of supply and demand, but from the standpoint of cost of\r\nproduction. The laboring man says that he has no quarrel with the\r\nfarmer, that in fact he is glad to pay the farmer what it costs him to\r\nproduce food. Most people take it for granted that the just price is\r\ncost of production. In July of 1917, President Wilson gave his scholarly\r\ndefinition of a just price: “By a just price I mean a price which will\r\nsustain the industries concerned in a high state of efficiency, provide\r\na living for those who conduct them, enable them to pay good wages and\r\nmake possible the expansion of their enterprises which will, from time\r\nto time, become necessary, as the stupendous undertaking of this great\r\nwar develops.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of a just price, covering cost of production and reasonable\r\nprofit, is considerably different from market price or supply-and-demand\r\nprice. The market price typically alternates considerably above and\r\nconsiderably below the production cost of the bulk of the people engaged\r\nin the enterprise. For instance, when prices go up and profits become\r\nlarger, new people are attracted into the business and production is\r\nincreased until finally there is more supply than there is demand, and\r\nthen prices have to go down and profits become losses, and the people\r\nwho can not produce except at the high prices must go out of business.\r\nBoth the farming world and the business world are composed of a great\r\nmany different men, each of whom is chasing a profit in his own way.\r\nMany of these men are very short-sighted and are lured into an\r\napparently profitable business just at the wrong time, and in like\r\nmanner become discouraged with an apparently unprofitable business at\r\njust the wrong time. Under the competitive regime, it is apparent to any\r\nthoughtful business man that both in business and in farming the market\r\nprice or supply-and-demand price is almost never the same as cost of\r\nproduction, but fluctuates in rather rhythmical manner, now above and\r\nthen below cost of production, tending to equal almost exactly, over any\r\nlong period of years, true production cost.\r\n\r\nUnder the market price or supply-and-demand price system as it has\r\nprevailed, the constant tendency is for the wealthier people, both among\r\nfarmers and among business men, to increase their wealth at the expense\r\nof the poorer people. Poor people who embark in general business or in\r\nfarming, no matter how intelligent, are likely to go into and come out\r\nof any particular enterprise at just the wrong time. The average man who\r\nis moderately well fixed and stays by a particular enterprise year in\r\nand year out, manages to secure for himself just a little better than\r\nordinary wages. The man who is wealthy and expands his operations just\r\nas prices are starting up, and reduces operations just as prices are\r\nstarting down, secures large profits.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuating price system, which means great profits to a wealthy\r\nfew, serious losses and wrecked lives for a few, and a bare livelihood\r\nfor many, is the natural result of the _laissez faire_ policy of the old\r\nclassical economists. Their idea was to let things alone, on the theory\r\nthat, let alone, prices would sooner or later adjust themselves to the\r\nproper point. In practice, prices almost never reach a proper point, but\r\nare constantly moving either above or below cost of production. One\r\nhundred years of _laissez faire_ policy have demonstrated beyond a doubt\r\nthat under such a system the wealthy few inevitably become richer,\r\nwhereas the bulk of the people get just enough to keep them going.\r\n\r\nThe _laissez faire_, supply and demand, speculative, or market price\r\nsystem, is condemned by nearly every one except the business men who run\r\nit and believe they understand its beneficent workings, and the\r\neconomists of the classical type who, in their careful reasoning, are\r\nunable to think of any other way of determining satisfactory prices over\r\nany period of time. The common people and the lofty idealists were\r\ngreatly elated during 1917 and 1918 at the apparently successful working\r\nof fixed prices established more or less in defiance of the speculative\r\nor _laissez faire_ price system.\r\n\r\nThose who have given the most thought to price fixing advocate as a\r\nguide “cost of production plus a reasonable profit.” But what is cost of\r\nproduction? Even in industries so well controlled by man as coal mining,\r\nwhere the weather does not enter in, there are some mines that can\r\nproduce a ton of coal for two or three dollars, while other mines can\r\nnot produce a ton of coal for less than six or seven dollars. The North\r\nDakota wheat farmer, in a year of rust, may produce wheat at a cost of\r\nfour or five dollars a bushel, whereas the Kansas farmer the same year\r\nmay produce wheat at a cost of only a dollar or a dollar and a half per\r\nbushel. Shall both the Dakota farmer and the Kansas farmer be paid cost\r\nof production plus a reasonable profit for their wheat? From this\r\nstandpoint we see that there is no such thing as a standard cost of\r\nproduction. A single producer may be able to determine his personal cost\r\nof production of a given quantity under a given set of conditions. But\r\nin the general sense, as it is commonly thought of, cost of production\r\nis a will-o’-the-wisp, a creature that seems to exist but really does\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is a rough-and-ready method of determining cost of\r\nproduction or just price as distinguished from _laissez faire_ or\r\nsupply-and-demand price. We refer to the ratio method of price\r\ndetermination. Over a long series of years, cost of production plus a\r\nreasonable profit is roughly expressed by the relationship which exists\r\nbetween a raw product and the finished product. In rough form it may be\r\nmost easily grasped in the case of corn and hogs. Over any long period\r\nof years, hogs sell on the Chicago market at a price per hundredweight\r\nequal to the Chicago price of 11.5 bushels of corn. When hogs have sold\r\nfor fourteen bushels of corn, they have sold for more than cost of\r\nproduction plus a reasonable profit, while, on the other hand, when they\r\nhave sold for nine bushels of corn, they have sold for less than cost of\r\nproduction plus a reasonable profit. All this is not saying that certain\r\nproducers have not been able to make a profit when hogs have sold for\r\nnine bushels of corn. Neither is it saying that certain producers may\r\nnot have been selling at a loss when hogs sold for as much as fourteen\r\nbushels of corn. It is simply saying that it has required the pulling\r\npower of a price for hogs which is equal to the price of 11.5 bushels of\r\ncorn to keep enough men in the hog business year in and year out to\r\nsupply the demand of this country for hog products during the past sixty\r\nyears. This is what we mean by the ratio method of price determination.\r\nIt is the only practical method of determining cost of production in\r\nsuch a business as farming, where there are millions of producers\r\nworking under a variety of conditions.\r\n\r\nWe have the greatest respect for the old _laissez faire_ or speculative\r\nmethod of price determination. It worked very nicely under competitive\r\nconditions, such as existed before the war. No one knows as to whether\r\nor not times now are right for adopting a different machinery thru which\r\nthe law of supply and demand may work. We offer the ratio method as a\r\nmethod which is probably better adapted to a thoroly democratized\r\nco-operative society than the old-fashioned _laissez faire_ method,\r\nwhich was adapted primarily to a competitive society.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the ratio method is highly technical. The examples given\r\nin this book must necessarily be simple. But in actual practice, the\r\nratio method would necessarily become quite technical, requiring for its\r\nadministration highly specialized statisticians. At the present time\r\nvery few men are available for work of this sort. The ordinary man who\r\ntries to fix prices by the ratio method is biased by either personal or\r\nclass interests. A notable example of this was the Chicago Milk\r\nCommission, composed of leading citizens of the state of Illinois, which\r\nsat from December, 1917, to February, 1918, and finally offered as a\r\nmethod of milk price determination the ratio method. The majority of the\r\nmembers of this Milk Commission were city people, and on that account,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, they twisted the ratio method so as to\r\nbring about a low price for milk. If the majority of the commission had\r\nbeen farmers, they could have twisted the ratio method to bring about a\r\nmuch higher price for milk. But there are now, and in the future will be\r\nmore, men properly trained in the weighting of agricultural index\r\nnumbers, who can look into matters of this sort with a scientific nicety\r\nand determine prices by the ratio method with the greatest accuracy, by\r\nwhich we mean the minimum of bias toward either producer or consumer.\r\n\r\nIt is our intention in this book to indicate ways of securing ratio\r\nprices for various agricultural products. The methods outlined in\r\nsucceeding chapters are definite and exact; we grant, however, that they\r\nmay be made more comprehensive and be further refined so as to cover\r\ntheir respective fields in more effective fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n           RATIO METHOD OF DETERMINING COST OF PRODUCING HOGS\r\n\r\nThe ratio method of price determination was first publicly recognized in\r\nthe United States by the Food Administration, in November of 1917. A\r\ncommission of seven swine men had been appointed by the Food\r\nAdministration to determine the cost of producing hogs, and in\r\nsubmitting their report the commission adopted practically without\r\nchange the ratio method of price determination as advocated in Wallaces’\r\nFarmer during the summer and fall of 1917. The commission, composed of\r\nexpert swine men from all over the United States, after a careful\r\ntechnical survey of the situation and consideration of the figures\r\nsubmitted by the author, came to the conclusion that the ratio method\r\nactually expressed cost of production more simply and accurately than\r\nany other method.\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, the hog producer of fifty years ago grasped the\r\nratio idea. Without any statistical investigation, the swine growers of\r\nthose days came to the conclusion that they could make money when they\r\nsold their hogs for a value per hundredweight of more than the value of\r\nten bushels of corn. For a generation or two, hog men looked on a ratio\r\nof ten bushels of corn to one hundred pounds of hog flesh as about\r\nright, altho they felt that such a ratio might not cover risk.\r\n\r\nFrom an exact statistical standpoint, take the ten-year period extending\r\nfrom 1907 to 1916, inclusive. During that time No. 2 Chicago corn\r\naveraged 66.3 cents a bushel, whereas hogs averaged $7.53 per\r\nhundredweight. The ratio for that particular ten-year period was 11.4\r\nbushels of Chicago No. 2 corn to equal in value one hundred pounds of\r\nChicago hog flesh. How uniform is this ratio between corn and hogs from\r\ndecade to decade may be judged from the following table, which gives the\r\nratios as they have prevailed year by year for the past sixty years, and\r\nthe average by decades. The second column shows the number of bushels of\r\ncorn required each year to equal in value one hundred pounds of live\r\nhog:\r\n\r\n                              1858–1867.\r\n                         1858              8.7\r\n                         1859              7.1\r\n                         1860             12.4\r\n                         1861             14.0\r\n                         1862             10.0\r\n                         1863              7.0\r\n\r\n                              1868–1877.\r\n                         1868              9.5\r\n                         1869             14.0\r\n                         1870             11.9\r\n                         1871             10.2\r\n                         1872             11.1\r\n                         1873             12.3\r\n                         1864              7.3\r\n                         1865             16.3\r\n                         1866             16.2\r\n                         1867              7.2\r\n                                          ————\r\n                         Ten-year average 10.6\r\n\r\n                         1874              8.9\r\n                         1875             11.8\r\n                         1876             15.3\r\n                         1877             11.5\r\n                                          ————\r\n                         Ten-year average 11.7\r\n\r\n                              1878–1887.\r\n                         1878              9.7\r\n                         1879             10.3\r\n                         1880             12.3\r\n                         1881             12.1\r\n                         1882             10.9\r\n                         1883             11.3\r\n                         1884             10.5\r\n                         1885              9.7\r\n                         1886             11.1\r\n                         1887             12.4\r\n                                          ————\r\n                         Ten-year average 11.0\r\n\r\n                              1888–1897.\r\n                         1888             12.3\r\n                         1889             12.5\r\n                         1890              9.9\r\n                         1891              7.4\r\n                         1892             11.8\r\n                         1893             16.5\r\n                         1894             11.6\r\n                         1895             10.8\r\n                         1896             10.7\r\n                         1897             14.2\r\n                                          ————\r\n                         Ten-year average 11.8\r\n\r\n                              1898–1907.\r\n                         1898             14.6\r\n                         1899             12.0\r\n                         1900             13.2\r\n                         1901             11.8\r\n                         1902             11.6\r\n                         1903             13.0\r\n                         1904             10.2\r\n                         1905             10.4\r\n                         1906             13.4\r\n                         1907             11.4\r\n                                          ————\r\n                         Ten-year average 12.2\r\n\r\n                              1908–1917.\r\n                         1908              8.4\r\n                         1909             11.3\r\n                         1910             15.2\r\n                         1911             11.2\r\n                         1912             10.9\r\n                         1913             13.2\r\n                         1914             11.7\r\n                         1915              9.6\r\n                         1916             11.5\r\n                         1917              9.7\r\n                                          ————\r\n                         Ten-year average 11.3\r\n\r\nTo refine the method to meet market conditions, we need to know the\r\nratio between corn and hogs at different seasons of the year. There are\r\nseasonal periods of over-supply and scarcity of both corn and hogs. In\r\nNovember, for instance, the 1907–1916 price of corn was 67.2 cents and\r\nthe price of hogs $7.23, or a ratio of 10.6 bushels to one hundred\r\npounds of hog flesh, while in March of the ten-year period the average\r\nprice of corn was 61.7 cents and the price of hogs $7.66, or a ratio of\r\n12.4 bushels of corn for one hundred pounds of hog flesh. In like\r\nmanner, there is a fairly normal ratio for each month of the year and\r\nfor each week of the year. All this is on the assumption that hogs are\r\nsimply condensed corn. It does not take into account the fact that hogs\r\nhave been made out of corn at varying values during a period of about a\r\nyear preceding time of marketing. Obviously, then, we must have a\r\ncomposite corn value. In matters of this sort, statisticians know that\r\nit is absolutely impossible to weight matters so as to represent actual\r\nconditions, but at the same time they know that absolute accuracy is not\r\nat all essential, that in fact a difference in weighting will ordinarily\r\nmake very little difference in results.\r\n\r\nWhile the author personally recommended to the commission appointed by\r\nthe Food Administration to investigate cost of producing hogs, a\r\nslightly different weighting, yet nevertheless we will use here the\r\nweighting recommended by that committee. The committee assumed that the\r\ncorn going into the making of a hog was distributed over twelve months;\r\nthat during the first month 2 per cent of this corn went into the hog or\r\nits dam; the second month, 2 per cent; third month, 2 per cent; fourth\r\nmonth, 3 per cent; fifth month, 4 per cent; sixth month, 6 per cent;\r\nseventh month, 5 per cent; eighth month, 9 per cent; ninth month, 15 per\r\ncent; tenth month, 20 per cent; eleventh month, 17 per cent, and twelfth\r\nmonth, 15 per cent. Securing composite corn values by this kind of\r\nweighting, we find that as an average of the ten-year period, 1907–1916,\r\nthe January ratio was 11 bushels; February, 11.6 bushels; March, 12.4\r\nbushels; April, 12.7 bushels; May, 12.3 bushels; June, 12.1 bushels;\r\nJuly, 12 bushels; August, 11.8 bushels; September, 11.8 bushels;\r\nOctober, 11.3 bushels; November, 10.6 bushels, and December, 10.4\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustrating the departure of actual Chicago hog prices from the\r\n    ten-year standard ratio, corrected seasonally.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor sake of example, determine cost of producing hogs for the Chicago\r\nmarket for the month of April, 1918. Corn values month by month,\r\nbeginning April, 1917, were as follows: 144.9 cents, 163.9 cents, 170.7\r\ncents, 200 cents, 197.2 cents, 208.6 cents, 199.2 cents, 201 cents,\r\n173.2 cents, 180.6 cents, 174.5 cents, and 172.3 cents. Weighting these\r\non the basis indicated, we get a composite value of corn of 182.5 cents.\r\n\r\nThe historical ratio for the month of April is 12.7 bushels of such\r\ncomposite corn. Multiply 182.5 cents by 12.7, and we secure $23.18 as\r\nthe cost of producing hogs for the Chicago market in April of 1918,\r\nunder the ten-year ratio method. The actual price was $17.45, or a loss\r\nof $5.73 per hundredweight. The chart which is published herewith\r\nillustrates graphically results secured in the same manner for every\r\nmonth during the ten-year period beginning 1907.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, Chicago No. 2 corn measures very accurately the changes in\r\ncorn value on the farm, the corn out of which hogs are actually made.\r\nDuring part of the winter of 1917–1918, Chicago No. 2 corn ceased to be\r\nquite such an accurate measure as usual, for the reason that the quality\r\nof the crop was so poor that only a small amount of corn graded No. 2,\r\nand for the further reason that there were severe transportation\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nSome people have urged not using Chicago No. 2 corn values, but corn\r\nvalues on farms as reported to the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, monthly, by crop reporters. This price is no doubt compiled\r\nwith considerable accuracy, but is open to objection for the reason that\r\nit does not represent a uniform grade. In soft corn years, a bushel of\r\ncorn as valued by crop reporters on farms is poor stuff. In such years,\r\nthere is always a wider spread between the farm value of corn and the\r\nChicago No. 2 value than in years when the quality is good. It might do\r\nfairly well to take farm values of corn and farm values of hogs if\r\ndefinite grades could be established. If they can not be, it is probably\r\nbest to take Chicago values of No. 2 corn and heavy hogs as a basis,\r\nmaking allowance occasionally when exceptional conditions arise in the\r\nway of artificial prices temporarily created by transportation\r\ndifficulties, and remembering always that the true point at issue is to\r\napply a ratio between certain grades of actual feed on the one hand and\r\na certain grade of hogs on the other. This is a technical matter which\r\nreally can not be decided by lawyers or business men, however competent\r\nsuch men may be to run a food administration or a department of\r\nagriculture, or by farmers, however competent such men may be to feed\r\nhogs. It is a matter which must be handled by men who understand markets\r\nand who have had sufficient economic training so that they understand a\r\nlittle something of the making of index numbers, and who have had\r\nsufficient touch with agricultural conditions so that they understand a\r\nlittle something of the technique of feeding hogs.\r\n\r\nSoon after the report of the commission on cost of producing hogs, the\r\nFood Administration announced among other things that it would do its\r\nbest to pay hog producers, for a hundred pounds of hog flesh, the\r\nequivalent of thirteen bushels of the corn which went into these hogs,\r\nthe ratio system to apply to hogs farrowed in the spring of 1918. It was\r\nexpected that there would be an urgent need for hog products during\r\n1919, and it has generally been regarded that this announcement of the\r\nFood Administration was wise. The thirteen-bushel ratio was 13 per cent\r\nover the historic ratio, and encouraged the transforming of a larger\r\namount of corn into hogs than usual.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to putting the thirteen-bushel ratio into effect, in the\r\nfall and winter of 1918–1919, the Food Administration did all in its\r\npower to squirm out of living up to its guarantee. First, the effort was\r\nmade, in the month of September, 1918, to make it appear that the\r\nthirteen-bushel ratio was based on a ratio between farm corn prices and\r\nChicago hog prices, in spite of the fact that the pamphlets originally\r\nissued by the Food Administration to farmers of the corn belt in\r\nNovember of 1917 explained the ratio on a basis of Chicago corn prices\r\nand Chicago hog prices. By using farm corn prices, the Food\r\nAdministration secured a figure of about $2.50 per hundredweight lower\r\nthan if the thirteen-bushel ratio had been applied literally as\r\ndescribed in the original pamphlets. The Food Administration, however,\r\nclaimed that it could not live up to its original guarantee, because the\r\nexport prices of pork would not justify it. In this respect, it is\r\ninteresting to note that in August of 1918, just before the Food\r\nAdministration took up this matter of carrying out its thirteen-bushel\r\nguarantee, Great Britain reduced its maximum price on American bacon by\r\nabout $12 per hundredweight. It is also interesting to note that the\r\nBritish Food Administration was making money on its handling of pork\r\nproducts, altho it was losing money on its wheat. Those American\r\nproducers who were most familiar with the situation believed that there\r\nwas a concerted effort by the American and British food administrations\r\nto buy the large American hog crop, which had been secured by the\r\nthirteen-bushel guarantee, as cheaply as possible, avoiding its\r\nguarantee with such chicanery and deceit as an experienced business man\r\nknows how to use in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nThe committee of some fifteen men, supposedly representing the American\r\nhog producers, which met with the United States Food Administration in\r\nthis matter, were not well educated along statistical or economic lines,\r\nand they went down to defeat in September, 1918, scarcely realizing just\r\nwhat the Food Administration had done to them. Only two members of this\r\ncommittee had served on the original commission, and it was impossible\r\nfor them to give the other members a full comprehension of what the\r\nratio meant. When the facts became known, widespread indignation among\r\nthe farmers of the corn belt compelled the Food Administration to\r\nabandon the hypocritical pretense of living up to the thirteen-bushel\r\nratio and come out flatly for a $17.50 minimum, which was really a ratio\r\nof 10.8 bushels. The Food Administration was able to thus repudiate in\r\npart its definite obligation to hog producers, because there were no\r\nthoroly organized farmers with leaders trained to think in terms of\r\nstatistics and economics.\r\n\r\nThe author does not care to create a prejudice against the Food\r\nAdministration. It probably did its work as efficiently as any branch of\r\nthe government during the war. The sole purpose is to point out to\r\nagricultural students the extreme disadvantage under which farmers labor\r\nin bargaining with other classes of society. It is hoped that as farmers\r\nlearn to follow the example of keen business men and employ trained\r\nexperts to look after their interests, and as farm leaders become better\r\ntrained in statistics, economics and business principles, this\r\ndisadvantage will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n              SUPPLY AND DEMAND VERSUS COST OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nWhat makes hour-by-hour and day-by-day prices under _laissez faire_\r\nconditions is not cost of production, but that brute force which we call\r\n“supply and demand.” In its blind groping, this force necessarily\r\napproximates cost of production as an average of any long period of\r\ntime. But it never specifically recognizes cost of production as a\r\nfactor which should be considered. It approximates cost of production\r\nbecause it has to, not because it wants to.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the strategy of the hog market is a case in point.\r\nImagine a Monday hog market in early March, at which season of the year\r\nprices are generally rising. Suppose that instead of the accustomed\r\n40,000 Monday hog run, 60,000 have been received. Suppose that, owing to\r\ncar shortage or some other reason, eastern shippers are out of the\r\nmarket. There is a larger supply than usual and a smaller demand, and\r\nprices decline 15 or 20 cents a hundredweight, perhaps very much more.\r\n“Supply and demand,” say the packers and practical economists, with\r\nunction. But at that very time every one may know that the potential\r\nsupply in the country is very small, and the potential demand is very\r\ngreat. At that very time this wider situation may be taken fully into\r\naccount by the packers in the prices which they are charging for their\r\nproducts to the retailers. The hog market may have broken 15 to 20\r\ncents, but the lard, ham and bacon markets may have held steady or even\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nThe packers, in the prices which they pay for live hogs and the prices\r\nwhich they charge for hog products, are governed chiefly by strategic\r\nconsiderations. Day by day they change their prices to meet the surface\r\nindications of changing supply and demand conditions. They may sometimes\r\nexercise such poor strategy that they will be compelled to manufacture\r\nhog products at a loss for a time. The prime consideration is to buy as\r\ncheaply as possible and to sell as high as possible and yet meet the\r\ncompetition, which is rather more active than many farmers have\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious that a ratio system of hog prices is not compatible\r\nwith the system employed by the packers, or by any typical business man,\r\nfor that matter. Big business enjoys a speculative profit which comes\r\nwith fluctuating prices. But a daily fluctuating price is not consistent\r\nwith the idea of a just price or a cost-ofproduction price. If the\r\npacking business were a monopoly under government control, stabilized\r\nprices under the ratio system might be paid with some degree of\r\nsatisfaction, provided we assume that the governmental authorities have\r\na real insight into market conditions and a thoro understanding of the\r\nratio system of price judgment as related to supply and demand. Under\r\nthe present regime, however, it is difficult to see much prospect of hog\r\nprices ever being stabilized, for the reason that under a _laissez\r\nfaire_ system business profits result from fluctuating prices, those\r\nbusinesses profiting most which are best organized and most long-lived,\r\nand are able to take strategic positions over long periods of time.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if cost of production were to be paid in the hog\r\nmarket day by day, year in and year out? By cost of production is meant\r\nthe 11.5-bushel ratio, modified seasonally. Packers can think of many\r\nobjections. For instance, they can conceive of periods of a year or two\r\nat a time when the 11.5-bushel ratio would necessitate paying the\r\nfarmers more for their hogs than they could get for the meat. Equally,\r\nthey can see how it might be that for periods of a year or two at a\r\ntime, they would be able to get out of the consumers a price equivalent\r\nto considerably more than the 11.5-bushel ratio. Admittedly, these\r\nobjections are sound under present conditions; supply-and-demand price\r\nis the only price adapted to the _laissez faire_ situation.\r\n\r\nIf farmers as a class are to secure cost of production for their hogs\r\nmonth after month and year after year, they must organize into powerful\r\nassociations to do business co-operatively. They must control the supply\r\nof hogs with an iron hand and an intelligent head. They must be willing\r\nto play fair with the consumers and not charge more for their hogs than\r\nthe ratio of the past sixty years. In fact, it is conceivable that they\r\nmight be able to sell their hogs at slightly less than the 11.5-bushel\r\nratio of the past sixty years. If the organization was really powerful\r\nenough to enforce the cost-of-production ratio over any period of time,\r\nthe market risk, which has been a very serious factor in the past, would\r\ndisappear. This risk has been such a factor that it is quite possible\r\nthat farmers would be willing to produce enough hogs to satisfy the\r\nmarket at an eleven-bushel ratio if the risk no longer existed. The\r\nauthor estimates that as an average of the past sixty years the\r\nconsuming public has been paying at least 50 cents per hundredweight\r\nmore than necessary for its hog products. This extra 50 cents has been\r\nin the nature of risk insurance.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that both farmer producers and city consumers might\r\norganize to carry this risk between them, the city consumer co-operative\r\norganizations agreeing in advance to take a certain number of pounds of\r\nhog products, and the farmer producing organizations agreeing to furnish\r\nsuch a quantity of hog products on the basis of a corn-hog ratio\r\nrepresenting cost of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   CATTLE PRICES AND THE RATIO METHOD\r\n\r\nA ratio between corn and cattle does not represent cost of production\r\nnearly as accurately as a ratio between corn and hogs. However, such a\r\nratio, when worked out and applied over a long period of years, reveals\r\nthe interesting historical fact that the swings in cattle prices above\r\nand below the ratio line are periods of about seven years each way.\r\n\r\nA more accurate method is to take into account the fact that fat cattle\r\nas produced in the corn belt and marketed at Chicago are commonly made\r\nout of feeders which were bought a few months previously, taken to the\r\nfarm, and finished chiefly on corn, together with a little in the way of\r\npasture, hay, silage and concentrated feeds, such as cottonseed meal and\r\noil meal.\r\n\r\nAs an average of the ten-year period, 1906–1915, ordinary 1,000-pound\r\nfeeders on Chicago, in October, cost $51.20. As an average of the\r\nten-year period, these same 1,000-pound feeders, as ordinary,\r\nwell-finished fat steers weighing 1,300 pounds each, sold the following\r\nApril for $98.35. During this ten-year period it seemed to take $47.15\r\nto cover the cost of feed, risk, labor, etc., of bringing a 1,000-pound\r\nfeeder to 1,300-pound fat condition. Ordinarily, it is substantially\r\naccurate to measure these things in terms of corn only. During the\r\nten-year period under consideration, the weighted price of corn was 61.5\r\ncents. Dividing $47.15 by 61.5 cents equals 76.7 bushels. As an average\r\nof the ten-year period it has required the value of 76.7 bushels of\r\nweighted corn to make a 1,000-pound feeder, bought in October,\r\nmoderately fat for the Chicago market the following April. The corn is\r\nweighted on the theory that the steers consume 8 per cent of it the\r\nmonth after they are bought, 15 per cent the second month, 20 per cent\r\nthe third month, 20 per cent the fourth, 20 per cent the fifth, and 17\r\nper cent the last month. Applying the ten-year ratio to the specific\r\nmonth of April, 1918, we find that a 1,000-pound feeder in October,\r\n1917, cost $84, and the value of 76.7 bushels of composite corn was\r\n$139.40, making a total cost of the finished 1,300-pound steer, $223.40.\r\nThe actual selling price in the month of April, 1918, was $199.55, or a\r\nloss of about $23.85 per steer. Applying the same method month by month,\r\nwe get the chart as herewith published. It expresses profits and losses\r\nwith a fair degree of accuracy to the ordinary cattleman who buys\r\nfeeders at the central market and feeds them for five to seven months,\r\nlargely on corn. During the winter of 1917–1918, the chart was not quite\r\nso accurate as usual, for the reason that the other expenses did not\r\nmount at this time as rapidly as corn. While heavy losses were incurred\r\nby cattle feeders, they were not so great as indicated in the chart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustrating the departure of prices of 1,300-pound native steers at\r\n    Chicago from the ten-year ratio.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe profits and losses of the big cattlemen of the far-western and\r\nsouthwestern states are not to be measured by such a chart. Their chief\r\nexpenses are labor and the cost of pasture. Weather conditions affect\r\nthem directly, whereas weather conditions in the corn belt affect cattle\r\nprofits indirectly, thru the price of corn. During 1917 and 1918, the\r\nwestern cattle men, with the exception possibly of those in certain\r\nsections of the southwest, which suffered from unprecedented drouth in\r\n1917, made unusually good profits. As a class, their profits were\r\nprobably not as large as the profits of the grain-growing farmers of the\r\nmiddle-west, but were far larger than the profits of the cattle feeders\r\nof the middle-west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PACKER PRICES AND THE RATIO METHOD\r\n\r\nThe Chicago packers buy hogs as cheaply as they can and sell the pork as\r\nhigh as they can. Nevertheless, for months at a time they may sell pork\r\nproducts at a loss. Over any long period of time there is a fairly\r\nconstant ratio between the value of one hundred pounds of live hog flesh\r\nand one hundred pounds of lard, ribs or other standard hog products. To\r\nsimplify matters, and for purposes of illustration, we will consider\r\nthat standard hog product, dry salt ribs, which makes up about 35 per\r\ncent of the live hog.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs an average of the ten years from 1886 to 1895, dry salt ribs\r\n(low-grade bacon) sold for the value of 136 pounds of live hog. During\r\nthe ten-year period from 1896 to 1905, ribs sold for the value of 137\r\npounds of live hog. During the ten-year period from 1906 to 1915, they\r\nsold for the value of 135 pounds of live hog. But while this ratio is\r\nquite constant over any long period of time, it varies considerably\r\naccording to the season of the year. As an average of the ten-year\r\nperiod of 1907–1916, the ratio was 136 pounds in January, 132 pounds in\r\nFebruary, 127 pounds in March, 126 pounds in April, 133 pounds in May,\r\n137 pounds in June, 137 pounds in July, 137 pounds in August, 135 pounds\r\nin September, 136 pounds in October, 140 pounds in November, and 139\r\npounds in December. In April of 1918, hogs averaged about $17.45 per\r\nhundredweight. Using the standard ratio for the month of April, of 126\r\npounds of live hog for one hundred pounds of ribs, we would get as the\r\nhog price of ribs $21.97. The actual price was about $23.21, or the\r\npackers got for the dry salt ribs in the month of April, 1918, about\r\n$1.24 more than the customary ratio. The chart tells the story,\r\nextending from 1905 to 1919. The black area above the line might be\r\ncalled packers’ profits and the black area below the line packers’\r\nlosses on the manufacture of ribs. As a matter of fact, the packers’\r\nprofits in the latter part of 1917 and early in 1918 were probably\r\nlarger than indicated. This method assumes that the packers’\r\nmanufacturing charges rise and fall in the same ratio as hog prices rise\r\nand fall. In the rough way, over any long period of time, this is\r\napproximately true, but it was probably not true in late 1917. Hog\r\nprices at that time were over 200 per cent of the ten-year period,\r\nwhereas packers’ manufacturing costs were probably not in excess of 170\r\nper cent of the ten-year period.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that as the packing business becomes even more\r\ncentralized and further improvements in the use of by-products are\r\ndiscovered, it may be possible for packers to sell short-ribs, as an\r\naverage of a ten-year period, for a price no more than the cost to them\r\nof 133 pounds of hog flesh. Under conditions as they prevail at present,\r\nhowever, the 135-pound ratio is approximately correct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustrating when short-rib sides have been above and below their\r\n    ten-year average ratio to live hog prices.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ratio method of determining profits and losses in the manufacture of\r\nvarious packers’ products is not put forward as an aid in any method of\r\npacking house accounting. It is, however, put forward as a method by\r\nwhich the consumer and the farmer can discover in a rough way when the\r\npackers are absorbing more than their customary share.\r\n\r\nA similar chart worked out for lard gives much the same results, altho\r\nat times the profit and loss of the two products do not always coincide\r\nexactly. For instance, in 1914, lard sold for far less than its normal\r\nratio during the entire year, whereas ribs sold for slightly more than\r\ntheir normal ratio. In 1919, lard sold far above its normal ratio and\r\nribs were below. Similar ratios might be worked out for all the various\r\nhog meats, and also for cattle and the various cuts of beef. What\r\nexamination we have made of some of these ratios indicates that the\r\npackers, in their buying of live stock and selling of products, regard\r\neach product as a law unto itself. If there is a large amount of stored\r\nlard on the market, on account of the shutting off of the German demand,\r\nlard prices may be reduced, even tho hog prices are such as to warrant\r\nlard selling at a dollar or two more per hundredweight. On the other\r\nhand, if the Allies at the same time are in the market for ribs, the\r\nprices will be advanced, even tho ribs may be made from hogs at a dollar\r\nor two less per hundredweight. The problem of the packers is to buy as\r\ncheaply as possible and sell as high as possible, in the knowledge that\r\ntoo wide a spread will invite competition. In the case of hog products,\r\na loss may be withstood on a rapidly rising market, because the\r\nmanufacturing loss will be compensated for by the speculative profit.\r\nThis was illustrated during a considerable part of the year 1917, when\r\nmost hog products sold at considerably less than their normal ratio, but\r\nwhen the packers actually made splendid profits, owing to the continual\r\nadvance of prices and speculative gain on products on hand.\r\n\r\nIn normal times we regard charts based on principles as stated in this\r\nchapter as approximately accurate in measuring packers’ profits and\r\nlosses in the manufacture of given products.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that the normal lard ratios may go lower in the near\r\nfuture. Corn oil, cocoanut oil, cottonseed oil and other tropical\r\nvegetable fats are being used as lard substitutes, and as a result lard\r\nmay sell decidedly below its normal pre-war ratio to hogs. However, in\r\nthis case the bacon hog will gain in popularity and the supply of lard\r\nwill be curtailed to a point which will justify a ratio almost as great\r\nas existed before the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MILK PRICE DETERMINATION\r\n\r\nJust what price farmers should get for their milk has been a peculiarly\r\nvexing question. Before the war, farmers selling milk to city dealers\r\nwere in an unusually weak bargaining position. When their position\r\nbecame intolerable, they organized into powerful bargaining\r\nassociations, many of which were said to be illegal under strict\r\ninterpretation of the law.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest formed and most powerful of these producers’\r\nassociations has been the Chicago Milk Producers’ Association, numbering\r\n16,000 members and controlling most of the milk that is shipped into\r\nChicago or manufactured in the district immediately around Chicago.\r\nDuring the years immediately preceding the entry of the United States\r\ninto the great war, this association bargained directly with the Chicago\r\nmilk dealers as to what prices the farmer members of the association\r\ncould get for their milk. They held a successful strike in April of\r\n1916, and thereafter the Chicago milk dealers seemed to regard the\r\nassociation with considerable respect. The city press and the city\r\npoliticians, however, felt that the farmers were too high-handed in\r\ntheir disregard of certain laws, and forthwith began agitation which\r\nfinally resulted in indictments against the leaders in the Producers’\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1917, the milk producers adopted as their guide in\r\narriving at milk prices what has been called Pearson’s formula.\r\nAccording to this formula, the cost of producing a hundred pounds of\r\nmilk in the Chicago milk district is equal to the cost of 44 pounds of\r\ngrain, plus 188 pounds of silage, plus 50 pounds of hay, plus 39 pounds\r\nof bedding, plus 2.42 man hours of labor. To the valuation thus secured,\r\ncertain differentials were to be applied to each month of the year, the\r\nwidest differential being 120.3 per cent, in December, and the narrowest\r\n70.6 per cent, in June. This formula was devised by Professor F. A.\r\nPearson, of the Dairy Economics Division of the University of Illinois,\r\nafter several years of actual cost-accounting work in the Chicago milk\r\ndistrict. It really represents actual cost of production on a large\r\nnumber of farms in certain specific years. Using Pearson’s formula as a\r\nguide, the Chicago milk producers asked the dealers $3.71 per\r\nhundredweight for their milk in November, 1917. The dealers refused, and\r\na strike was declared. The Food Administration intervened in an\r\nunofficial way and induced the producers to agree to a price of $3.22\r\nper hundredweight, pending an investigation by the federal government as\r\nto a price which should cover cost of production and a reasonable\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nThe Food Administration appointed as a committee to determine cost of\r\nproducing milk plus a reasonable profit, six people of essentially city\r\ninterests and three people of essentially agricultural interests. This\r\ncommittee took testimony during the months of December and January, and\r\nin their report took as a guiding principle in determining the cost of\r\nproducing milk the ratio method. Early in December, the author was asked\r\nto present to the commission a profit and loss chart on milk produced in\r\nthe Chicago district since January, 1907, the profits and losses being\r\nbased on ratios between milk prices per hundredweight on the one hand,\r\nand a composite of corn, oats, bran, cottonseed meal, gluten feed, hay,\r\nand labor prices on the other hand. These latter ingredients were\r\nweighted roughly as in the Pearson formula, but corn was given greater\r\nemphasis. Incidentally, it is interesting to note as corroborative both\r\nof the ratio method and the cost-of-production method as employed by\r\nProfessor Pearson, that the two methods give very similar results. Of\r\ncourse, it is conceivable that if Professor Pearson had made his\r\ncost-accounting investigation in a year either of extremely good pasture\r\nor extremely poor pasture, the two methods would not agree. But taking\r\nas he did fairly average years, the results check very closely.\r\n\r\nWhile the Chicago Milk Commission adopted the principle of the ratio\r\nmethod, it did so with certain modifications. To illustrate the method\r\nas adopted by the Chicago Milk Commission, we quote from the report as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“The commission has therefore selected as a base, representing cost of\r\nproduction and a fair profit, the average sale price per one hundred\r\n(100) pounds over the years 1908 to 1915, inclusive. The result of\r\ncourse does not represent present value, due to the large advance in\r\ncost of feed and labor since that time. The quantity of feed and labor\r\nper one hundred (100) pounds of milk, however, is the same in both\r\nperiods. Considering the eight-year period as a base and distributing\r\nfeed and labor on a basis of 100 per cent total, the commission\r\ndeveloped the following ratio: Nineteen per cent home-grown grains, 19\r\nper cent mill-feeds (wheat, bran, wheat middlings, hominy, cottonseed\r\nmeal, oil meal, gluten feed, dry salt), 35 per cent hay (including\r\nsilage valued at the ratio of three tons of silage to one ton of hay),\r\n27 per cent labor.\r\n\r\n“It was agreed by the commission that variations in the prices of those\r\nfour units represent with sufficient accuracy, when applied according to\r\nthe above ratio, the increase or decrease in the cost of production of\r\nmilk. The only criticism made to this base or this plan was by a\r\nminority of the members of the commission, that the price to the\r\nproducer during the eight-year period referred to was not satisfactory\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n“From the monthly price reports issued by the Department of Agriculture,\r\nthe farm prices of home-grown grains and hay are obtainable, and from a\r\nreliable trade journal published in Milwaukee the wholesale prices of\r\nmill-feeds are obtainable. The average over the eight-year period from\r\nthese records is as follows: Corn, $1.107 per hundred pounds;\r\nmill-feeds, $1.306 per hundred pounds; hay, 55.7 cents per hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n“It appears fair to the industry that it is entitled to the same\r\nproportionate increase in the price of its product as has occurred in\r\nthe elements which make up the product. From the records of the\r\nDepartment for November, 1917, the beginning of the period under\r\nconsideration, the following prices prevailed, obtained from the same\r\nsources: Corn, $3.089 per hundred pounds; mill-feeds, $2.3655 per\r\nhundred pounds; hay, 78 cents per hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n“The commission has considered from the evidence and such information as\r\nwas obtainable that the price of labor in November represents 50 per\r\ncent advance over the average for the eight-year period. Using the\r\nproportion of feed and labor and prices over the eight-year period, and\r\ncomparing with November prices from the same source of information and\r\non the same products, we find the following ratio of increase:\r\n\r\n ═══════════╤═══════════╤═══════════╤═══════════╤═══════════╤═══════════\r\n            │   Basic   │Eight-year │ November, │   Pct.    │New Index.\r\n            │  Index.   │  period   │   1917,   │ increase  │\r\n            │           │ average.  │  price.   │Nov., 1917,│\r\n            │           │           │           │over 8-year│\r\n            │           │           │           │  period.  │\r\n ───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n Corn       │         19│     $1.107│     $3.089│        179│      53.01\r\n Mill-feeds │         19│      1.306│     2.3655│       81.1│      34.41\r\n Hay        │         35│       .557│       .780│         40│      49.00\r\n Labor      │         27│           │           │         50│      40.50\r\n ───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n            │        100│           │           │           │        177\r\n ───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────\r\n\r\n“The average price of milk per one hundred (100) pounds for the month of\r\nNovember, from 1908 to 1915, inclusive, was $1.768. Applying the new\r\nindex ratio of 1.77, the November, 1917, price would be, therefore,\r\n$3.13. In the same manner, the price for any month may be determined by\r\ntaking the average price over the eight-year period for that month and\r\nmultiplying it by the index figure, 1.77. It will be noted that by the\r\nuse of this method the _ratio_ of the costs of feed and labor between\r\nthe average of the eight-year period and the November, 1917, period, is\r\nused rather than the actual prices of the commodities.\r\n\r\n“The average monthly prices of milk per hundred pounds over the\r\neight-year period were as follows: November, $1.768; December, $1.812;\r\nJanuary, $1.781; February, $1.737; March, $1.60; April, $1.406; May,\r\n$1.15; June, $1.017. Applying this index, 1.77 November price, to these\r\nfigures: November, $3.13; December, $3.20; January, $3.15; February,\r\n$3.07; March, $2.83; April, $2.49; May, $2.04; June, $1.80.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustrating when Chicago milk prices have been above and below their\r\n    ten-year average ratio to feed and labor prices.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis report was signed only by the city members of the commission. The\r\nagriculturally-minded members and the Chicago milk producers knew that\r\nthe prices secured by the ratio method as advocated by the commission\r\nwere not high enough to cover cost of production. The fault was in the\r\nmethod of application. Hay and labor between them were made to\r\nrepresent, according to the commission, 62 per cent of the total cost of\r\nproducing milk, which is altogether too high a weighting. This bad\r\nweighting was made worse because of the fact that thoroly up-to-date\r\nfigures on hay and labor were not available, and the figures which were\r\ntaken were far lower than those existing at the time when the report was\r\nactually published. The converting of silage into terms of hay instead\r\nof into terms of corn is a matter open to grave question in view of the\r\nfact that silage production costs are almost identical with corn\r\nproduction costs, and the alternative market for silage is the corn\r\nmarket and not the hay market. Several other mistakes were made which\r\nmight have been avoided if the method had been applied by a thoroly\r\nimpartial body well versed in the technique of dairying as well as the\r\nweighting of agricultural index numbers. The unjust prices secured by\r\nthe commission should not be blamed on the ratio method, but on the way\r\nin which it was applied. The finest scales are not dependable in the\r\nhands of an ignorant or a dishonest man.\r\n\r\nWe present herewith a historical milk chart indicating profits and\r\nlosses from January, 1908.\r\n\r\nA full description of the derivation of the Pearson formula is to be\r\nfound in Bulletin No. 216 of the Illinois Experiment Station.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COST OF PRODUCING CROPS\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of determining the cost of producing crops—the\r\ncost-accounting method and the ratio method. The common method is the\r\ncost-accounting system, as employed by farm management investigators.\r\nFor example, it has been found that the average farmer in the corn belt\r\nputs about twenty hours of man labor and fifty hours of horse labor on\r\nthe average acre of corn. This divides up roughly into three hours of\r\nman labor and twelve hours of horse labor for plowing, three hours of\r\nman labor and twelve hours of horse labor for disking and harrowing,\r\nthree-fourths of an hour of man labor and one and one-half hours of\r\nhorse labor for planting, six hours of man labor and twelve hours of\r\nhorse labor for cultivating, six hours of man labor and twelve hours of\r\nhorse labor for husking, two hours of man labor and five hours of horse\r\nlabor for manuring and miscellaneous. In addition to the man and horse\r\nlabor charges are machinery expense, seed, manure or fertilizer,\r\ninsurance and depreciation on the general overhead charges, and the rent\r\nof land. With man labor at 35 cents an hour, horse labor at 18 cents an\r\nhour, land rent at $12 an acre, and machinery and miscellaneous expenses\r\nat $4 an acre, the total cost of producing an acre of corn in 1919 was\r\nabout $32. On extra good land, the rent was as high as $18 or $20 an\r\nacre, and the cost of an acre was increased accordingly. However, on\r\nextra good land the yield was decidedly above the average. The average\r\nacre yield in Iowa in 1919 was forty bushels, or the cost of producing a\r\nbushel of corn was roughly 80 cents on the farm in the month of\r\nDecember. The 1919 crop was decidedly above the average; with an average\r\ncrop it would have cost the Iowa farmer right around 90 cents a bushel\r\nin such a year as 1919.\r\n\r\nThe ratio method when applied to corn corroborates the farm management\r\ninvestigational method. The ratio method is based on the supposition\r\nthat the cost of producing corn varies with the cost of man labor, horse\r\nlabor and machinery. For the sake of convenience, it is taken that the\r\ncost of horse labor varies with the price of corn, oats and hay, and\r\nthat the price of agricultural machinery varies with that part of Dun’s\r\nindex known as metals. Roughly, it is figured that of the cost of\r\nproducing corn in Iowa, 35 per cent is represented by land charge, 20\r\nper cent by man labor, 15 per cent by corn (used either as seed or fed\r\nto horses), 10 per cent by hay fed to horses, 5 per cent by oats fed to\r\nhorses, 10 per cent by Dun’s metals, and 5 per cent by Dun’s\r\nmiscellaneous. Dun’s metals are given a lag of two years, and Dun’s\r\nmiscellaneous of one year, owing to the fact that machinery and the\r\nmiscellaneous overhead expenses entering into the cost of corn\r\nproduction become felt rather slowly.\r\n\r\nApplying the ratio method, we will take as our base the ten-year period\r\nfrom 1897 to 1906. During this period Iowa land averaged about $50 an\r\nacre; harvest labor, without board, $2 a day; corn, 29.4 cents a bushel;\r\nhay, $5.47 a ton; oats, 23 cents a bushel; Dun’s metals, about $14, and\r\nDun’s miscellaneous, about $15. The average acre of Iowa corn during\r\nthis ten-year period was worth on a December 1st farm basis $10.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1919, Iowa land was worth about $192 an acre, or 384 per cent of\r\nthe basic ten-year period; man labor, without board, at harvest time was\r\naround $5.20 a day, or approximately 260 per cent of this ten-year basic\r\nperiod. In like manner, corn was 410 per cent; oats, 280 per cent; hay,\r\n330 per cent; Dun’s metals, 230 per cent, and Dun’s miscellaneous, 230\r\nper cent. If land is allowed a weighting of 35 per cent; man labor, 20\r\nper cent; corn, 15 per cent; hay, 10 per cent; oats, 5 per cent; Dun’s\r\nmetals, 10 per cent, and Dun’s miscellaneous, 5 per cent, we arrive at\r\n329 per cent as the cost of producing an acre of corn in 1919, as\r\ncompared with 100 per cent for the basic ten-year period. In the basic\r\nten-year period, an acre of corn actually sold for $10. In 1919, in\r\norder to come as near breaking even as in the basic ten-year period, an\r\nacre of corn should sell for $32.90. The ratio method gives almost\r\nidentically the same results as the farm management method. Both\r\nindicate that it cost the average Iowa farmer in 1919 about 80 cents to\r\nproduce a bushel of corn on a basis of December 1st farm values.[4]\r\n\r\nThe ratio method may be applied to other crops by using a somewhat\r\ndifferent weighting of the production factors. In the case of oats in\r\nIowa, for instance, land may be given a weighting of about 35 per cent;\r\nman labor, 15 per cent; corn, 10 per cent; hay, 10 per cent; oats, 15\r\nper cent; Dun’s metals, 10 per cent, and Dun’s miscellaneous, 5 per\r\ncent. This would indicate that oats in Iowa in 1919 cost about 324 per\r\ncent as much as in the basic ten years. In the basic ten-year period,\r\nthe average acre of oats in Iowa sold for $8. We may therefore conclude\r\nthat the cost of producing oats in 1919 was 324 per cent of $8, or\r\n$25.92. With an average yield of thirty-three bushels per acre, the cost\r\nper bushel was about 78 cents on a December 1st farm basis.\r\n\r\nManifestly, the weak point in the ratio method of determining cost of\r\nproducing crops is the character of the basic period. Did the crops\r\nactually sell during the basic ten-year period for cost of production?\r\nManifestly, in some years they sold for less, and in some years they\r\nsold for more. As an average of the entire ten-year period, they must\r\nhave sold for at least cost of production, or farmers would gradually\r\nhave reduced their acreage of the particular crop under consideration,\r\nor else gone out of business entirely. As a matter of fact, in the\r\nten-year period under consideration, 1897–1906, land values were\r\nconstantly advancing. It would seem, on the whole that this particular\r\nten-year period is a fair one to use, and that as an average of these\r\nten years crops sold for approximately cost of production, no more, no\r\nless.\r\n\r\nIt is always conceivable that over long periods of time there might have\r\noccurred changes in supply or demand conditions that would make the\r\nbasic ten-year period altogether false for the purpose of comparison.\r\nFor example, in the case of oats, it is conceivable that tractors,\r\ntrucks and automobiles might so displace horses as to make the city\r\ndemand for oats decidedly less than during the ten-year period extending\r\nfrom 1897 to 1906. The oats acreage might therefore be considerably\r\ndecreased, and oats be produced in large quantities only in those\r\nsections especially adapted to growing oats. It is conceivable,\r\ntherefore, that the ratio method may possibly give the cost of oats\r\nproduction at rather too high a figure, a figure impossible of\r\nrealization, one year with another. In the case of standard crops,\r\nhowever, there is remarkably little change in either supply conditions\r\nor demand conditions. Methods of producing corn are pretty well\r\nstandardized. The market for corn is almost equally stable. It is\r\nbelieved that the ratio method of determining cost of corn production\r\nwill be approximately accurate for the next fifty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONSUMERS’ RATIOS\r\n\r\nDuring the past fifty years, a number of people have set themselves to\r\nwork to measure the shifting economic tides with index numbers. The more\r\ncomplete of these index numbers really undertake to measure the changing\r\nvalue of the dollar. In July of 1914, for instance, Dun’s index number\r\nwas $119.71, which meant that it required $119.71 to buy a certain given\r\namount of wheat, corn, oats, pork, beef, butter, eggs, wool, hides, pig\r\niron, lumber, petroleum, etc. On September 1, 1919, it required $238.34\r\nto buy these same goods. The dollar of July of 1914 had become worth\r\nabout 50 cents in September of 1919, in its ability to buy wholesale\r\nproducts. The consumer, in his buying, has certain choices. The man who\r\nthinks pork is too high in price can shift to beef or mutton; or he can\r\nleave meat altogether out of his ration and secure the needed nutrients\r\nin dairy or poultry products.\r\n\r\nThe producers’ ratios, as described in preceding chapters, have to do\r\nfundamentally with supply conditions. They deal with the relation\r\nbetween a raw product and a more finished product. They are concerned,\r\nbut not immediately, with demand conditions. The attempt in this chapter\r\nis to develop a ratio which gives more particular weight to demand\r\nconditions. Therefore, ratios are developed between a standard index\r\nnumber on the one hand and a given commodity on the other. However,\r\nbecause index numbers include some of the items of expense entering into\r\nthe production of any commodity, such a ratio also represents to a\r\nconsiderable extent a producers’ ratio.\r\n\r\nTo understand the matter more definitely, we shall look into the ratio\r\nactually prevailing between Dun’s index number and Chicago hog prices.\r\nAs an average of the ten-year period, 1907–1916, Dun’s index number in\r\nJanuary has averaged $120.16, whereas hogs during the same period have\r\naveraged $6.99 per hundredweight. In other words, live hogs have sold\r\nper hundredweight for about one-seventeenth of the value of Dun’s index\r\nnumber. On this basis, in January of 1907, the index price of hogs was\r\n$6.24, whereas the actual price was $6.60, or 36 cents higher. In\r\nJanuary of 1908, the index price of hogs was $6.59, whereas the actual\r\nprice was $4.45, or $2.14 lower. And so it goes. For the period of a\r\nyear or two, hogs will sell proportionately higher than other\r\ncommodities, and then for a like length of time they will sell lower.\r\nThis is graphically illustrated in the accompanying chart. This chart,\r\nit will be noted, is very similar in appearance to the corn-hog ratio\r\nchart. The chief point of difference is in 1917 and 1918, during which\r\ntime hogs sold relatively higher than an average of other commodities,\r\nas indicated by Dun’s index number, whereas they were relatively lower\r\nthan corn. War conditions, creating an unprecedented demand for\r\nbreadstuffs, raised grain prices out of all proportion to other\r\ncommodities. On studying this chart closely, it will be noticed that\r\nthere is a tendency, generally speaking, for hogs to sell relatively\r\ncheap to other commodities a few months in advance of the time that they\r\nsell relatively cheap to corn, and vice versa. In other words, the\r\nvariations shown on the chart as given in this chapter are often two or\r\nthree months ahead of the chart as given in the chapter on corn-hog\r\nratios.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustrating the departure of Chicago hog prices from the ten-year\r\n    ratio between hog prices and Dun’s index number.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA historical study of the ratio between index numbers and Chicago steer\r\nprices indicates that steer prices swing first above and then below\r\ntheir index number value in periods of from five to nine years each way,\r\nwith an average of around seven years.\r\n\r\nThe 1907–1916 ratio between Dun’s index number and wholesale prices of\r\ncertain farm products is given in the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n ═════════╤══════════════╤═══════════════╤══════════════╤═══════════════\r\n          │Heavy hogs at │   1,200 to    │Butter extras │ No. 2 corn at\r\n          │ Chicago, per │   1,500-lb.   │  at Elgin,   │Chicago, cents\r\n          │     cwt.     │   steers at   │  cents per   │  per bushel.\r\n          │              │  Chicago per  │    pound.    │\r\n          │              │     cwt.      │              │\r\n ─────────┼──────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────┼───────────────\r\n January  │         .0583│          .0597│          .263│           .499\r\n February │         .0604│          .0593│          .255│           .503\r\n March    │         .0638│          .0620│          .251│           .514\r\n April    │         .0652│          .0631│          .241│           .537\r\n May      │         .0631│          .0636│          .215│           .555\r\n June     │         .0632│          .0655│          .212│           .551\r\n July     │         .0638│          .0659│          .212│           .572\r\n August   │         .0638│          .0670│          .219│           .602\r\n September│         .0642│          .0665│          .233│           .582\r\n October  │         .0620│          .0656│          .242│           .559\r\n November │         .0578│          .0634│          .254│           .537\r\n December │         .0568│          .0621│          .264│           .518\r\n ─────────┴──────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────┴───────────────\r\n\r\n  With Dun’s index number at $245 for December of 1919, the method of\r\n  finding the index price of hogs is to multiply $245 by .0568, which\r\n  gives $13.92.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not claimed that the ratio between Dun’s index number and hogs,\r\nfor instance, is as constant as the ratio between hogs and corn. In the\r\ndecade of the ’60’s, hogs sold for one-third lower in relation to Dun’s\r\nindex number than in the decade ending in 1916. There has been a\r\nconstant tendency for farm products to sell constantly higher in\r\nrelation to Dun’s index number. And this tendency doubtless will\r\ncontinue until population becomes stationary, altho there may be several\r\nyears at a time when the tendency is apparently halted because of\r\nimprovements in agricultural efficiency. In the main, the possibility of\r\nimprovements in industrial efficiency is so much greater than in\r\nagriculture that we may expect that agricultural prices will stand in\r\nconstantly higher ratio to other prices, until finally the increase in\r\npopulation is checked.\r\n\r\nWorking out ratios between Dun’s index number and retail prices as\r\nreported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we find that as an average\r\nof the 1907–1916 period, .183 of Dun’s index number represented the\r\nprice of sirloin steak in cents per pound. For other commodities sold at\r\nretail the ratio factors were:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 1.\r\n\r\n                  Round steak, per pound        $.159\r\n                  Rib roast, per pound           .148\r\n                  Pork chops, per pound          .157\r\n                  Bacon, per pound               .206\r\n                  Ham, per pound                 .199\r\n                  Lard, per pound                .122\r\n                  Hens, per pound                .165\r\n                  Eggs, per dozen                .267\r\n                  Butter, per pound              .294\r\n                  Milk, per quart                .071\r\n                  Flour, per bag of 24.5 pounds  .722\r\n                  Corn meal, per pound           .023\r\n                  Potatoes, per peck             .243\r\n                  Sugar, per pound               .051\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in September of 1919, when there was a\r\nuniversal outcry against retail prices, an outcry vigorously encouraged\r\nby notoriety-seeking politicians, that retail prices were about as might\r\nhave been expected from Dun’s index number. Dun’s index number was\r\n$238.34 on September 1, 1919, and the first column of Table 2 gives the\r\nretail price which we might expect by applying the standard ratios. The\r\nsecond column gives actual prices on September 15th, as reported by the\r\nBureau of Labor Statistics:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLE 2.\r\n\r\n               Sirloin steak, per pound      $.436 $.409\r\n               Round steak, per pound         .379  .379\r\n               Rib roast, per pound           .352  .312\r\n               Pork chops, per pound          .374  .460\r\n               Bacon, per pound               .490  .556\r\n               Ham, per pound                 .474  .552\r\n               Lard, per pound                .291  .382\r\n               Hens, per pound                .393  .414\r\n               Eggs, per dozen                .636  .632\r\n               Butter, per pound              .701  .657\r\n               Milk, per quart                .169  .157\r\n               Flour, per bag of 24.5 pounds 1.721 1.790\r\n               Corn meal, per pound           .055  .067\r\n               Potatoes, per peck             .579  .645\r\n               Sugar, per pound               .122  .110\r\n\r\nThe factors as worked out in Table 1 are ratios between yearly average\r\nretail prices and yearly average Dun’s index numbers. Even retail\r\nprices, however, have some seasonal swing. For instance, meats tend to\r\nbe cheaper in the winter than in the summer, whereas butter and eggs\r\ntend to be cheaper in the summer than in the winter. Because of the\r\nseasonal swing, the first column of Table 2 is not absolutely accurate.\r\nFor instance, the retail price of sirloin steak in September is usually\r\nabout 2 per cent higher than the yearly average, and, corrected for the\r\nmonth of September, the price should have been 44.5 cents, instead of\r\n43.6 cents. On the same basis, the seasonally corrected price for butter\r\nfor September, 1919, was 68.6 cents, instead of 70.1 cents.\r\n\r\nIn the main, however, Table 2 is fairly accurate as it stands. It will\r\nbe noted that with the exception of hog products, wheat and potatoes,\r\nretail prices in September of 1919 tended to be lower than their normal\r\nratio to Dun’s index number.\r\n\r\nPossibly a consumers’ attack on the price of pork products, wheat and\r\npotatoes was warranted in September of 1919. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that there was supposedly a world need for hog products and\r\nwheat at that time, and that potatoes were unduly high on account of a\r\nshort crop.\r\n\r\nConsumers should be educated in the use of index numbers and to an\r\nunderstanding of normal ratios between index numbers and the various\r\ncommodities which they buy. In times of violent price fluctuations they\r\nshould know just what is the index price of the commodities whose prices\r\nare acting in a questionable way. At the same time they should realize\r\nthat the index price is not necessarily the just price. However, the\r\nindex price gives a basis upon which the consumer may work. He may then\r\ninquire why it is that the actual price departs from the index price. In\r\nMay of 1918, for instance, the index price of corn in Chicago was $1.25,\r\nwhereas the actual price was $1.60. The actual price was above the index\r\nprice partly because of a poor quality corn crop in 1917, but\r\nparticularly because of an unprecedented demand for breadstuffs.\r\nNevertheless, everything considered, the consumer may have had some\r\nbasis for resentment against the high price of corn and corn products,\r\nwhereas if he had studied the milk and butter situation, he would have\r\nseen that the dairy products were being sold at a real bargain. Strange\r\nto say, consumers kicked vigorously against milk prices, but had nothing\r\nto say about corn prices. Consumers are always concerned with\r\nsuperficial appearances, never with fundamental causes. And this\r\ncharacteristic of city consumers, combined with an unscrupulous,\r\nignorant city press, is a grave menace to our civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TECHNIQUE OF THE RATIO METHOD\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea of the ratio method is that the price of every\r\nproduct is determined in the long run by the price of some other product\r\nor products. The price of hogs is determined in the long run by the\r\nprice of corn. The price of corn is determined in the long run by the\r\nprice of land, labor, farm machinery and horse feed.[5]\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form, the ratio method deals with only two products, as\r\nfor example, with hogs and corn. As an average of the ten Januarys\r\nextending from 1907 to 1916, No. 2 corn on the Chicago market sold for\r\n59.9 cents a bushel, and heavy hogs on the same market sold for $7 per\r\nhundredweight. In other words, as an average of this ten-year period, it\r\nhas required the value of 11.7 bushels of corn to equal in value one\r\nhundred pounds of heavy hog flesh. In the specific month of January,\r\n1907, corn was 41.6 cents per bushel. The corn price of hogs was 11.7\r\ntimes 41.6 cents, or $4.87. The actual price of hogs in January, 1907,\r\nwas $6.60. Actual hogs sold for $1.73 above the customary corn-hog\r\nratio. In January of 1908, with corn at 58.5 cents a bushel, the corn\r\nprice of hogs would be 11.7 times 58.5, or $6.84. The actual price was\r\n$4.45, or $2.39 below the ratio price. The ratio for February is\r\ndifferent from the ratio for January, but once a set of ratios is\r\nsecured for each of the twelve months of the year, it is easily possible\r\nto work out charts showing month by month the periods of time when hogs\r\nwere selling relatively higher than their customary ratio to corn, and\r\nwhen they were selling relatively lower.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary to work ratios month by month, or week by\r\nweek, in the case of all products which have a seasonal swing. Nearly\r\nall agricultural products are cheap in the fall of the year. Some\r\nproducts begin weakening sooner than others; for instance, oats and\r\nwheat weaken sooner than corn or hogs.\r\n\r\nA genuinely scientific method of applying the ratio method to hog prices\r\nwould also take into consideration that hogs are to some extent made out\r\nof tankage, pasture and labor, as well as corn. Of course, these things\r\nvary in value in a rough way, in just about the same way as corn prices,\r\nand for practical purposes, the ratio between hogs and corn is probably\r\nexact enough.\r\n\r\nAs an example of a more complex application of the ratio method, assume\r\nthat after thoro investigation by the farm management people, it is\r\nfound that on typical farms 70 per cent of the cost of producing hogs is\r\nrepresented by corn, 5 per cent by tankage, 3 per cent by oats, 3 per\r\ncent by pasture, 2 per cent by middlings, 6 per cent by man labor, and\r\n11 per cent by miscellaneous items, such as risk, interest, etc., all of\r\nwhich vary in about the same ratio as the other items already\r\nenumerated. Spreading the 11 per cent of miscellaneous items over the\r\nother items, we find that of the cost of producing hogs, 78 per cent is\r\nrepresented by corn, 3 per cent by oats, 6 per cent by tankage, 4 per\r\ncent by pasture, 2 per cent by middlings, and 7 per cent by man labor.\r\nNow, as an average of the ten-year period, 1907 to 1916, the value in\r\nthe month of January, at Chicago, was 59.9 cents for corn and 43.4 cents\r\nfor oats. The value of middlings on a Milwaukee basis was $22.77 per\r\nton. The value of tankage (this is a rough estimate) was $46 per ton;\r\nthe value of pasture land, $66 per acre, and the value of an hour of man\r\nlabor 14.6 cents. Hogs averaged $7 per hundredweight.\r\n\r\nAccording to the ratio theory, this ten-year average price of $7 per\r\nhundredweight for hogs must represent approximately cost of production.\r\nSeventy-eight per cent of $7 gives $5.46 as the share of corn in the\r\nproduction cost, and in like manner 21 cents is the value of the oats,\r\n42 cents the value of the tankage, 28 cents the value of the pasture, 14\r\ncents the value of the middlings, and 49 cents the value of the man\r\nlabor. With corn at 79.9 cents a bushel, as it was during this ten-year\r\nperiod, and other feeds at prices as mentioned in the foregoing, it is\r\nobvious that it required, to equal one hundred pounds of hog weight, the\r\nvalue of 9.1 bushels of corn, one-half bushel of oats, one-two hundred\r\nand fiftieth of the value of an acre of ordinary rough pasture land,\r\ntwelve pounds of middlings, eighteen pounds of tankage, and 3.4 hours of\r\nman labor. In the specific month of January, 1907, corn was worth 41.6\r\ncents; oats, 35.4 cents; middlings, $18.37; ordinary rough pasture land,\r\n$51 per acre; tankage, $40 a ton, and man labor, 13 cents an hour. Nine\r\nbushels of corn at 41.6 cents gives $3.78; half a bushel of oats at 35.4\r\ncents gives 18 cents; twelve pounds of middlings at $18.37 per ton gives\r\n10 cents; one-two hundred and fiftieth of the value of an acre of\r\nordinary pasture land, at $51 per acre, gives 20 cents; eighteen pounds\r\nof tankage at $40 per ton gives 36 cents, and 3.4 hours of man labor at\r\n13 cents gives 44 cents. Adding, we get $5.06 as the cost of producing\r\nhogs in January, 1907. In January, 1908, with corn at 58.5 cents per\r\nbushel, oats at 49.9 cents, middlings at $22.62 per ton, tankage at $40\r\nper ton, pasture at $51 per acre, and man labor at 13 cents an hour, we\r\nfind, by applying the same formula, that the cost of producing one\r\nhundred pounds of hogs was $6.69. The straight corn ratio method gave\r\n$4.87 for January of 1907, and $6.84 for January of 1908, departing from\r\nthe more complex ratio on the minus side by 19 cents in 1907 and on the\r\nplus side by 15 cents in 1908. The results are so nearly alike that in\r\nthe case of hogs we think that it is ordinarily satisfactory to depend\r\non corn ratios alone, altho in the case of such products as milk and\r\nbutter it is well to include feeds other than corn and to use a method\r\nsimilar to that just outlined.\r\n\r\nIn order to allow the general public to judge of the merits of wage\r\nincreases, strikes and price advances, it would be well if the ratio\r\nmethod might be applied to manufacturing and mining industries; for\r\ninstance, in the case of coal, it might be shown (these figures are\r\npurely illustrative and possibly are wide of the facts) that 40 per cent\r\nof the cost of producing coal is labor, 20 per cent machinery charge,\r\nand 40 per cent risk, interest on investment and similar factors, which\r\nvary in just about the same ratio as the other two factors already\r\nmentioned. Distributing this 40 per cent miscellaneous charge, we get 67\r\nper cent of the cost of producing coal represented by labor and 33 per\r\ncent by machinery charge. Now, assume that, in 1920 the labor charge has\r\nadvanced over the ten-year base by 90 per cent, and the machinery charge\r\nby 110 per cent. Multiplying 67 by 190 and 33 by 210 and adding, we find\r\nthat on this basis coal in 1920 should be about 94 per cent above the\r\nten-year base. If the ten-year base is $3.50 per ton, the proper price\r\nfor coal in 1920 should evidently be somewhere around $6.80 per ton.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is obvious that anyone applying the ratio method must be\r\nthoroly familiar with the industry under consideration. There should be,\r\nhowever, competent experts in whom the public has confidence, to express\r\nfor the benefit of the public, in ratio form, the cost-of-production\r\nprice of all staple products, and possibly labor as well.\r\n\r\nOur grade schools and our high schools should train their students to\r\nhave an appreciation of the ratio method of determining prices. An\r\nappreciation of this sort developed in the minds of the bulk of our\r\npeople would do much to stabilize the price system, preventing undue\r\nexcesses, and yet allowing prices which cover in a fair way cost of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIMITATIONS OF THE RATIO METHOD\r\n\r\nThe ratio method, while astonishingly accurate as a method for\r\nascertaining production costs, is not infallible. In the case of hogs\r\nand corn, for example, the ratio has remained constant, decade by\r\ndecade, for sixty years. It is always conceivable, however, that a\r\nchange in production methods will come which will enable farmers to\r\nproduce hogs for less than the 11.5-bushel ratio. It is also conceivable\r\nthat as population increases, there will be a smaller premium put on\r\nmeat and a greater premium put on grain, with the result that the\r\nstandard ratio will fall below eleven bushels. But in any event the\r\nchange will be slow, and in all probability the ratio of the fifty years\r\nfrom 1925 to 1975 will not fall below 11 bushels.\r\n\r\nIn the case of such products as butter, where improvements in method\r\ncount for more than in the case of hogs, there is more likelihood of the\r\nstandard ratio changing as time goes on. In the case of such standard\r\ncrops as corn and wheat, there is small probability of great change in\r\nthe standard ratios. Any undue and prolonged profit will be promptly\r\nabsorbed by land values and labor wages.\r\n\r\nAbout the only technological improvement which would throw the standard\r\nratios altogether out of line would be the discovery of how to make food\r\nout of air and water by manufacturing processes.\r\n\r\nThe ratio method, when used in price fixing, rather than in price\r\njudging, is open to several objections. Under a _laissez faire_ system\r\nit may be necessary for months at a time to cater to the consumers by\r\nselling food at below the ratio or cost-of-production price. And again\r\nit is possible for months at a time to gouge the consumer by selling\r\nfood above the ratio or cost-of-production price. It is only as farmers,\r\nconsumers and business men become educated to the desirability of prices\r\nmore nearly approximating cost of production that the ratio system can\r\nbe used extensively in actual price fixing. When it is so used, there\r\nwill be less likelihood of over-production on the one hand and\r\nunder-production on the other hand.\r\n\r\nWherever the ratio system comes to be used in actual price fixing, it\r\nwill be open to the criticism that prices will start pyramiding. For\r\nexample, in the case of hogs and corn, a guaranteed ratio may increase\r\nthe price of corn, and this in turn the price of hogs, and so on in a\r\nnever-ending climb. The reverse is also imaginable. In the case of\r\nfixing crop prices by ratio, it is imaginable that land values would\r\nconstantly increase, and this would increase the price of crops, which\r\nagain will be reflected back into land, and so on in a never-ending\r\ncycle. Economists like to dwell on situations of this kind. They are to\r\na large extent purely imaginary. To stop a vicious rise under the ratio\r\nsystem, a rise which would bring about an over-production, all that\r\nwould be necessary would be to very slightly lower the standard ratio.\r\nIn the case of hogs, for example, it might be necessary to lower the\r\nratio from 11.5 bushels to 11.2 bushels.\r\n\r\nHowever, in all that is said concerning the ratio method of judging\r\nprices, there is no intention to prescribe any definite method of using\r\nthe system. The chief function of ratios will doubtless continue to be\r\neducational. It is hoped that a knowledge of standard ratios by large\r\nnumbers of people will suffice to stabilize prices at more nearly cost\r\nof production and to stabilize production at a point more nearly\r\nidentical with normal demand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      RETAIL AND WHOLESALE PRICES\r\n\r\nThere has been much outcry in recent years against the retailer.\r\nUnquestionably, the retailer is working under a cumbersome distributive\r\nsystem which burdens the consumer with prices fully 20 per cent too\r\nhigh. It is commonly recognized that this extra 20 per cent does not\r\nrepresent retailers’ profits, but that it is used simply to perpetuate a\r\nsystem which will cater most effectively to the whims of indolent\r\nhousewives. The cure for the system is for consumers to organize\r\nthemselves into co-operative buying associations. When consumers are\r\nwilling to band themselves together in such associations, to anticipate\r\ntheir needs of staple products by ordering ahead, it will be possible to\r\nfurnish such products at very little above wholesale prices. In fact, it\r\nis conceivable that under such a regime co-operative consumers might buy\r\nof co-operative producers. All this, however, involves infinitely more\r\nforesight than the average citizen or his wife cares to exercise. Also\r\nit involves putting a vast number of small grocerymen out of business.\r\nIn the long run, this will be a good thing for every one, but the\r\nimmediate effect will be a great outcry against interfering with\r\nlegitimate business, and the issue will be obscured by the customary\r\nsmoke screen used by scared business men.\r\n\r\nAs long as we cling to our present retail system, it is worth while to\r\nknow the standard differential between retail prices on the one hand and\r\nwholesale prices and farmers’ prices on the other hand. For instance, in\r\n1913, ham quite customarily retailed at around 26 or 27 cents a pound,\r\nwhereas the wholesale price at the same time was around 16 or 17 cents a\r\npound, and farmers were selling their hogs at around 8 cents a pound. It\r\nwas a fairly normal state of affairs, previous to the war, for ham to\r\nsell retail at 10 cents a pound above the wholesale price, or 18 cents\r\nor 19 cents a pound above the price of hogs. Just what the normal\r\ndifferential will be, now that the war is over, can not be foretold with\r\naccuracy. As long as we are on a price level twice as high as in 1914,\r\nit is obvious that the differential between retail and wholesale prices\r\nwill be just about twice as great. The retailer may not pay quite twice\r\nas much to his labor, and he may not pay quite twice as much rent, but\r\nhe will have to have twice as much operating capital, and his bad debts\r\nwill probably be twice as great. At this writing, early in 1920, it\r\nseems obvious that the retailers should be allowed to have a\r\ndifferential fully 80 per cent larger than before the war, if they are\r\nto fare as well as most other classes. As a matter of fact, the\r\nretailers now seem to be selling ham at a differential of about 18 cents\r\na pound over the wholesale price and about 36 cents a pound over the\r\nprice of hogs. In the case of ham, the retailers began demanding an\r\nincreased margin in May of 1917, the month after the war broke out. They\r\nkept increasing the margin as opportunity presented itself, but not till\r\nthe summer of 1919 were the retailers able to widen out the differential\r\nbetween retail and wholesale prices sufficiently to cover the cost of\r\ndoing business on a price level twice as high as in 1914.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Illustrating how the differential between farmers’ price and wholesale\r\n    and retail price widens in proportion to the higher price level.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe facts concerning the retail price of ham, wholesale price of ham,\r\nand price of hogs, are presented in the accompanying chart. Other retail\r\nprices are given in the appendix, and it is possible from the figures\r\nthere presented to work out normal differentials for such products as\r\nwheat and wheat flour, corn and corn meal, sirloin steak and cattle,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n           PORK EXPORTS THE BAROMETER OF CORN BELT PROSPERITY\r\n\r\nFor years we have exported from the United States more corn in the form\r\nof pork than in the form of shelled corn or corn meal. In recent years\r\nwe have been exporting an average of about 40,000,000 bushels of corn in\r\nthe form of corn and corn meal, whereas we have been exporting the\r\nequivalent of about 130,000,000 bushels of corn in the form of pork\r\nproducts. And for the year 1919 we exported the equivalent of about\r\n350,000,000 bushels of corn in the form of pork.\r\n\r\nThere is an extraordinary sympathy between the corn and hog industries.\r\nTrue it is that we feed almost as much corn to our horses as we do to\r\nour hogs, but the corn which we feed to horses is for the purpose of\r\nkeeping the farm plant running. The corn fed to horses does not bring in\r\ndirect cash returns in the same way as the corn fed to hogs. Nearly\r\none-third of all our corn is fed to hogs, and from the standpoint of\r\nmarket strategy, this third which is fed to hogs counts more than the\r\nother two-thirds. The demand for the other two-thirds by horses and\r\ncattle and by the grist mills of the towns and cities is practically\r\nstationary from one year to the next. It is the corn which is fed to\r\nhogs that varies so greatly from one year to the next.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten months of 1919, the value of the pork products\r\nexported from the United States was $778,000,000, or about one-eighth of\r\nthe value of all the exports from the United States for this period. The\r\nonly other product of practically equal magnitude with pork products was\r\ncotton, with a total value of $775,000,000 for the first ten months of\r\n1919. Wheat and wheat flour, which most people think rank decidedly\r\nabove the value of pork products, totaled during this period\r\n$556,000,000. Corn and corn meal exports during this period were worth\r\nan insignificant $15,000,000. Of course we are now exporting more pork\r\nproducts than ever before in history, but even before the war the corn\r\nbelt expressed itself in international trade pre-eminently thru its\r\nexports of pork products. The ham, bacon and lard of the corn belt are\r\ncomparable with the wheat of the northwest and the cotton of the south.\r\n\r\nBefore the war, we exported every year the equivalent of about five or\r\nsix million hogs. Last year we exported the equivalent of thirteen or\r\nfourteen million hogs, nearly one-fifth of our total production. Exports\r\ndropped off during September, October and November, but this is a\r\ncustomary seasonal occurrence, and there is now the prospect of a\r\nresumption of a tremendous exportation of hog products during the winter\r\nand early summer.\r\n\r\nThe two charts printed herewith indicate the very close connection\r\nbetween pork exports and profits in corn raising. The chart giving the\r\nprofits and losses on the average acre of corn for the past forty-five\r\nyears is re-published from Wallaces’ Farmer of May 17, 1918, the profits\r\nfor the years 1918 and 1919 having been added since. It will be noted\r\nthat the other chart gives the exports of hog products in pounds from\r\nthe United States year by year. The exports are in fiscal years, ending\r\non June 30th. It will be noted that in a broad, general way, there is a\r\nconsiderable relationship between the two charts. When pork exports have\r\nbeen less than normal for a year or two, there is a decided tendency for\r\ncorn to become unprofitable, and vice versa. Note how the big hog\r\nexports, starting in 1877 and continuing thru 1881, were accompanied by\r\na period of unusual corn profits. Note how the falling off in hog\r\nexports, starting with 1882 and continuing until 1890, was also\r\naccompanied by unprofitable corn crops. Then there was a temporary turn\r\nfor the better in both corn and hog exports in 1890 and 1891, and a sag\r\nin both until 1897, when hog exports picked up and continued to pick up\r\nto a very marked degree for several years, the change in hog exports\r\nbeing slowly reflected in corn profits. Generally speaking, pork exports\r\nseem to lead the way, and corn tags along behind. During the war years,\r\nhowever, corn seemed to move just about as fast as hog exports. The\r\nfirst year of really heavy hog exports was the year ending June 30,\r\n1916, and the first corn crop to sell unusually high was that harvested\r\nin the fall of 1916. The corn crops of 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919 have\r\nall been extraordinarily profitable, and the pork exports during these\r\nsame years have been unusually heavy. Unquestionably, there is a very\r\nclose relationship between hog exports and the general level of corn\r\nprices. We do not mean to say that there is a month-by-month\r\nrelationship, or even a year-by-year relationship. We do mean to say,\r\nhowever, that it is impossible for the United States to export an\r\nunusual volume of hog products without sooner or later raising corn\r\nprices. It may take a year or two for the effect to be felt by corn, but\r\nsooner or later the influence seems to be inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Curved line indicates the normal trend of pork exports from the United\r\n    States. When the irregular line is above the curved line, pork\r\n    exports are unusually large. Large pork exports beginning with 1877\r\n    caused the corn belt prosperity beginning with 1879. Large pork\r\n    exports beginning with 1898 initiated the corn belt prosperity\r\n    beginning with 1920. The 1920 figure is a preliminary estimate.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHeavy hog exports make for higher corn prices, and higher corn prices\r\nmake for higher values in corn belt farm land. Without much question,\r\nthe fundamental cause of corn land rising so much more rapidly than land\r\nin other sections is the unusual volume of pork products starting with\r\nthe year 1916. It would have been impossible for the corn market to have\r\nreached or sustained its high altitude without the prop of such\r\ntremendous hog exports. In view of the evidence presented, we make bold\r\nto say that hog exports furnish a most delicate barometer of corn belt\r\nprosperity. The huge volume of pork exports during the past three years\r\nis the explanation of corn belt land rising faster than in other\r\nsections. Iowa raises twice as many hogs as any other state, and this\r\ndoubtless is the reason why land in Iowa has risen faster than in any\r\nother state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Corn profits and losses in the twelve north central states, as\r\n    determined by the ratio method described in the chapter on “Cost of\r\n    Producing Crops.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhat of the future? Is there any chance that pork exports will maintain\r\ntheir present volume? We may as well face the issue squarely and come to\r\nthe conclusion that in all probability pork exports, within three or\r\nfour years, will decline to about one-third their present volume. For\r\nfour or five years previous to the war, the tendency of pork exports was\r\nsomewhat downward. It is reported that at that time Great Britain was\r\nbuying less and less of her hog products from the United States, and\r\nthat she was thinking of buying more and more of her coarser quality of\r\nhog products from China. At the present time there is considerable\r\nChinese bacon on the English market. It is also worth while to note in\r\nthis connection that the English consumption of meat is now 1,200,000\r\ntons, which is 600,000 tons less than her pre-war consumption of meat.\r\nIf England has cut down on her meat consumption one-third, the\r\nprobabilities are that the continent of Europe has cut down on its meat\r\nconsumption one-half. Probably never again will the world eat as much\r\nmeat per capita as it did before the war. Whether we like it or not, we\r\nmay as well face the probability that our pork exports are on the\r\ndecline, and will not stop declining until they are down to about\r\none-third of the 1919 volume.\r\n\r\nAnd we may expect that this decline in pork exports will have some\r\ninfluence on corn prices, and therefore on corn land prices. The future\r\nsituation is of course considerably different than that which has\r\nexisted at any time during the past forty-five years. The volume of\r\nmoney in circulation may be such that there will be no actual decline in\r\ncorn prices or in corn land prices. Just the same, we may expect that\r\nthe unusually favorable position which has been enjoyed by the corn belt\r\nduring the past three years will disappear with the decline in pork\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the war, Great Britain and Germany absorbed more of our pork\r\nexports than any other nations. Great Britain took 73 per cent of our\r\npork exports, 86 per cent of our exports of hams and shoulders, and 36\r\nper cent of our lard exports. Germany took 30 per cent of our lard\r\nexports and practically nothing in the way of bacon, hams or shoulders.\r\nCuba, Holland and Belgium were the other large importers of American hog\r\nproducts, but these three nations together required only about one-tenth\r\nas much as Great Britain. If Great Britain cuts down her consumption of\r\nmeat to two-thirds what it was before the war, she will be much more\r\nnearly self-supporting from a meat standpoint than she is now, and\r\nprobably will not import from the United States more than one-half as\r\nmuch meat as she did before the war. Great Britain owes considerable\r\nmoney to the United States, and, moreover, in the future she will not\r\nget from the United States in such large measure ocean freight charges\r\non the British merchant marine. In the old days, Great Britain had a\r\nconsiderable credit balance coming to her every year from the United\r\nStates, and she took a large part of this in the form of pork products.\r\nNow that the situation is reversed, it is difficult to see how Great\r\nBritain can import as much in the way of hog products from the United\r\nStates as she did before the war. True it is that for the year 1919 she\r\nhas imported about three times as much from the United States as before\r\nthe war, but once the present emergency is past, it seems obvious that\r\nGreat Britain will cut her pork imports down to the minimum.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Germany, the situation is even worse. Germany, which\r\nnormally took 150,000,000 pounds of lard from us every year before the\r\nwar, must now pay the allied nations an indemnity every year of at least\r\n$600,000,000. In order to pay this huge sum, Germany must cut her\r\nimports down to the absolute minimum, and become extraordinarily\r\nefficient in exporting. For the next two or three years, Germany may\r\nperhaps import more lard from us than she did before the war, but, as\r\nrapidly as possible, Germany will re-establish her swine industry and\r\nreduce the imports of American lard.\r\n\r\nWe may be painting the situation too black, but we can not see how our\r\npork exports, by the year 1925, can total to more than 800,000,000 or\r\npossibly 900,000,000 pounds, which is less than one-third the 1919\r\nvolume of exports. Of course, another war may break out in the meantime,\r\nor some other extraordinary thing may happen, but in the ordinary course\r\nof events, it would seem that our pork exports must inevitably decrease\r\nuntil they are considerably less than the pre-war normal. And it would\r\nseem that this decrease in pork exports will have a very considerable\r\nbearing on corn prices, which will in turn have a bearing on corn land\r\nprices. Again, we wish to say, however, that we do not necessarily\r\nbelieve that corn land in 1925 or 1930 will be selling cheaper than it\r\nis today. Prices of all kinds doubtless will continue to be high in 1925\r\nand 1930, for the simple reason that inflated currency the world over\r\nwill still continue. The point we are trying to make is that once hog\r\nexports decline to the pre-war normal, or less, corn belt farming will\r\ncease to enjoy the unusual advantage which it had during the war. It may\r\nfor a time be relatively less profitable than farming in certain other\r\nsections of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere are many curious paradoxes in the hog export trade in the United\r\nStates. While a heavy export of hog products sooner or later means high\r\ncorn prices, high hog prices and corn belt prosperity generally, yet as\r\na usual proposition, heavy hog exports do not start except in times of\r\nunusually low hog prices. The heavy exports of 1877–1881 did not start\r\ntill hogs had declined below $5 a hundred, and reached their height\r\nwhile hogs were $3 to $4 a hundred. In 1882, when hog prices climbed to\r\nover $8 per hundred on the Chicago market, hog exports promptly fell\r\noff, and did not climb again until hog prices again went below $4 a\r\nhundred, in 1890. In early 1893, when hog prices on the Chicago market\r\nclimbed up to nearly $8 a hundred again, hog exports dropped off very\r\nsuddenly. They did not pick up at once in 1896, when hog prices went\r\nunder $4 again, but did pick up very rapidly in 1897 and 1898, during\r\nboth of which years hog prices on the Chicago market were under $4 a\r\nhundred most of the time. In 1902, there were heavy exports, in spite of\r\nthe fact that hog prices were relatively high, but by 1903 the British\r\napparently had had enough of buying high-priced pork on the American\r\nmarket, and they curtailed their importations very decidedly. Again, in\r\n1910, the exceedingly high prices stopped the export demand. During the\r\npast three years there have been unprecedented exports in spite of\r\nunusually high prices. But as a matter of fact, hog prices in the United\r\nStates have been cheaper during the past three years than any place else\r\nin the world. We have been selling hogs at a great bargain, or Great\r\nBritain would not have bought such tremendous quantities from us.\r\n\r\nA thoro study of the exports of the United States month by month from\r\nJanuary, 1903, thru the year 1914, indicates that there is a continual\r\ntendency for hog exports to be large when hog prices are low, and vice\r\nversa. The correlation coefficient between hog prices and hog exports is\r\nminus .52. There seems to be a closer correlation between hog exports\r\nand hog prices than between receipts of hogs at central markets and hog\r\nprices. The tendency has been for hog exports to be 40 per cent above\r\nnormal when hog prices are 15 per cent below normal; for hog exports to\r\nbe 20 per cent above normal when hog prices are 8 per cent below normal,\r\netc. In November of 1919, when hog exports were about 40 per cent above\r\nnormal, it would have appeared, therefore, that hog prices were about 15\r\nper cent below normal. This is a long-swing tendency, and of course\r\nthere are occasional exceptions. This part of the problem may be summed\r\nup to the effect that big exports start in times of low hog prices, and\r\nthat these exports after a time stimulate both corn and hog prices, with\r\nthe result that after a time both corn and hogs become so high in price\r\nthat exports dry up, and then corn and hog prices weaken, and the whole\r\nthing starts over again. There was a continuous series of these cycles\r\nprevious to the war, and it is to be expected, now that the war is over,\r\nthat the phenomena will repeat themselves, altho with some added\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nOne thing we must remember is that very possibly the export trade of the\r\nUnited States will not count so big in the future as it has in the past.\r\nThe United States has loaned something like $10,000,000,000 to foreign\r\ncountries, and every year she will have hundreds of millions of dollars\r\nin interest coming her way, instead of owing hundreds of millions of\r\ndollars to countries across the water, as was the case before the war.\r\nAnd as long as the United States has so much money coming to her in\r\ninterest charges, we must expect that eventually the United States must\r\nimport more goods than she exports. This does not necessarily mean the\r\ndestruction of the hog industry in the corn belt, but it may mean that\r\nit will have to shift onto a somewhat different basis. It may be that in\r\nthe future we must plan on growing enough hogs only to satisfy the needs\r\nof the United States, carefully avoiding a glut which will make it\r\nessential to export any large quantity. Or it may be that the American\r\nfarmer is so exceedingly efficient in the business of producing hogs\r\nthat the United States will always export large quantities of pork\r\nproducts, even tho the balance of trade otherwise is against the United\r\nStates. If we approach the problem from the standpoint of going after a\r\nlarge trade in hog products with foreign countries, we must put\r\nourselves in position to produce with the utmost economy possible.\r\n“Price” talks in the export business, and we shall export large\r\nquantities of hog products whenever we are selling hogs decidedly\r\ncheaper than the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nJust what kind of a whistle do we want, and what price are we willing to\r\npay for it? Here is a problem which we commend to the earnest study of\r\nthe research department which the National Farm Bureau Federation may\r\nsome day possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CORN BELT LAND VALUES IN RELATION TO COST OF PRODUCING CORN\r\n\r\nRent or interest on the money invested in land is a legitimate item in\r\ncost of production—so far as the individual farmer is concerned. But\r\nsociety is likely to reach a time when it will assert the right to\r\nobject to paying a price for corn which will permit of paying a very\r\nhigh rent, which in turn is used to support very high land values.\r\n\r\nSociety may say, in effect: Your high land values are just as vicious as\r\nwatered railway stock, and you have no more right to expect a five per\r\ncent return on the inflated value than the railroads have to expect such\r\na return on their watered stock.\r\n\r\nSociety may be expected to pay a price for corn which is established by\r\ncompetition between farmers in this country and in the Argentine, and by\r\nthe need of Europe for our pork products. This price doubtless will bear\r\nmuch the same relation to the general price level as before the war. It\r\nmay be high enough to permit of corn belt land values as they existed in\r\n1920, or even higher values. Or it may be low enough to compel a\r\nreduction in corn belt values and farm-hand wages.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a severe drop in corn prices, it is conceivable but not\r\nprobable that corn belt farmers will organize sufficiently to compel the\r\nreturn to a price high enough to maintain 1920 land values and farm-hand\r\nwages.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that under conditions of free competition it will be\r\nnecessary for corn to sell for about 85 cents a bushel, on a basis of\r\nDecember 1st farm valuations in the corn belt in the ordinary crop year,\r\nin order to maintain land values as they existed in 1920. This means\r\nthat prices might go as low as 70 cents a bushel in years of big crops,\r\nor as high as $1 in years of small crops. It is also assumed that labor\r\nat harvest, without board, will settle down to about $4.25 a day, which\r\nwas the 1918 level. If labor at harvest, without board, continues at $5\r\na day, which was the 1919 level, it will be necessary for corn to sell\r\nfor about 88 cents a bushel, on a December 1st farm basis, in order to\r\nmaintain the 1920 level of land values and farm-hand wages.\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that this prediction may be wide of the mark in case\r\nfarmers are able to organize themselves for selfish purposes as\r\neffectively as capital and union labor. For forty years preceding the\r\nwar, the farmer paid his regular monthly labor a sweated wage, and, in\r\neffect, sold his own labor just as cheaply. During the war, the farmer\r\nhad a taste of a higher standard of living, and, having had this taste,\r\nhe will be loath to let farm product prices slip back to a point where\r\nhe will be reduced to his former state or even lower.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested as the only effective way out of the difficulty that\r\nfarmers organize into powerful bargaining organizations, which, on\r\noccasion, can practice sabotage as skillfully as capital or union labor.\r\nBut, in addition, and above all, it is absolutely necessary to become\r\nextraordinarily efficient. We must continue to apply our best brains to\r\nproduction problems, perfecting methods which will enable us to produce\r\ncorn 10 cents a bushel cheaper in Iowa than in Argentina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   PRICE STABILITY AND SOIL FERTILITY\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest arguments for more stable prices is the effect on\r\nsoil fertility. While the best farmers will try to maintain the\r\nfertility of their land, no matter what may be the economic outlook, the\r\nbulk of our farming population will not make any serious efforts along\r\nthis line as long as the price outlook is uncertain. When prices are\r\nadvancing, the tendency is for millions of acres of farm land to find\r\ntheir way into the hands of speculators and investors, who hold for a\r\nrise, and who take no interest whatever in the application of lime and\r\nphosphate or the growing of clover. When prices are tending downward,\r\nthere is a tendency to economize to the limit. Even those farmers who\r\nnormally use fertilizers are likely to postpone purchases until next\r\nyear or the year after, in the hope of lower prices. It is only under a\r\nsystem of relatively stable prices that we may expect really effective\r\nattention to be given to soil fertility problems by the bulk of our\r\nfarmers. The quicker we can get onto a stable price level, the more\r\neffectively will the fertility of our soil be conserved.\r\n\r\nIt is common observation that live stock farming maintains the fertility\r\nof the soil more effectively than grain farming. In the corn belt, live\r\nstock farms ordinarily produce five bushels more corn per acre than\r\ngrain farms. Two great obstacles to live stock farming are tenancy and\r\nprice uncertainty. The man of small means who has been farming for\r\nhimself for only a few years can not afford to take a chance. He does\r\nnot know whether or not hogs will be at a price next year which will\r\nfurnish a good market for corn, and he therefore plays safe by breeding\r\nonly three or four sows, instead of the five or six which he might very\r\nwell handle. Unquestionably, the farmers in the corn belt would be\r\njustified in keeping more live stock if the price of live stock should\r\nrepresent cost of production day by day and month by month. In fact,\r\ncorn belt farmers, as an average of a five-year period, could probably\r\nafford to produce both hogs and cattle at lower relative prices than\r\nwere customary before the war, if only prices were more nearly stable,\r\nif they could feel reasonably sure of getting a price more nearly\r\nrepresenting production cost.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the fertility of our soil is a matter of national\r\nconcern. In the long run, it is of more vital interest to the people of\r\nthe cities than to the farmer. Men engaged in industrial enterprises\r\nshould do what they can to favor such adjustment of prices as will make\r\nit to the advantage of the farmer to keep his land in good heart,\r\nbecause that will make for larger production and more economical\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MEASURING TOTAL CROP PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThis chapter does not follow the same line of thought as the other\r\nchapters. It has an indirect bearing, however, and we believe the\r\nsuggested method of measuring total crop production to be of some value.\r\n\r\nSmall crops ordinarily bring the farming class more money than large\r\ncrops. Nevertheless, in the long run big crops mean prosperity to the\r\ncountry as a whole. To judge just when crops as a whole are large and\r\nwhen they are small, a method has been devised, which may be illustrated\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nIn 1918, the United States produced 2,582,814,000 bushels of corn,\r\n917,100,000 bushels of wheat, 89,833,000 tons of hay, 11,700,000 bales\r\nof cotton, etc. Now, to ascertain total crop production, it is obviously\r\nimpossible to add together bushels, tons, bales, etc. We can add\r\ntogether the value of the crops, but the price level shifts from year to\r\nyear, and this method is not satisfactory.\r\n\r\nNow, the 1907–1916 ten-year average price of corn was 61 cents, of wheat\r\n96.2 cents, of hay $11.49 a ton, of cotton $59 a bale, etc. A ten-year\r\naverage illustrates the relative economic emphasis. These prices are\r\ntherefore used as constant factors, applicable to any crop year.\r\n\r\nThe 1918 corn crop of 2,582,814,000 bushels, converted into economic\r\ncrop units by multiplying by 61, equals 157,500,000,000. The 1918 wheat\r\ncrop of 917,100,000 bushels, multiplied by 96.2, equals 63,600,000,000.\r\nThe same thing done with the thirteen leading crops gives\r\n559,900,000,000 crop units produced by the United States in 1918, or\r\n5,270 crop units per capita.\r\n\r\nThe per capita production of crop units since 1880 has been as follows:\r\n\r\n       ══════════════════════╤═══════════╤═══════════╤═══════════\r\n       1880             5,360│1890  4,720│1900  5,820│1910  5,320\r\n       1881             4,280│1891  5,820│1901  4,470│1911  4,850\r\n       1882             5,330│1892  4,840│1902  5,480│1912  5,690\r\n       1883             5,120│1893  4,710│1903  4,930│1913  4,950\r\n       1884             5,560│1894  4,030│1904  5,220│1914  5,410\r\n       1885             5,250│1895  4,980│1905  5,200│1915  5,770\r\n       1886             4,970│1896  5,170│1906  5,560│1916  4,940\r\n       1887             4,690│1897  5,070│1907  4,940│1917  5,530\r\n       1888             5,240│1898  5,360│1908  5,220│1918  5,270\r\n       1889             5,910│1899  5,760│1909  5,100│1919  5,400\r\n       ──────────────────────┼───────────┼───────────┼───────────\r\n       Decade Averages, 5,171│      5,046│      5,194│      5,313\r\n       ──────────────────────┴───────────┴───────────┴───────────\r\n\r\nNote how constant has been the productive power of the United States in\r\neconomic crop units per capita, decade by decade, since 1880. Note that\r\nsince 1910 crop production has more than kept pace with the increase in\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn the ’80’s we exported the equivalent of about 650 economic crop units\r\nper capita (in this we convert pork exports into corn), which left,\r\nroughly, 4,500 economic crop units per capita for home consumption. In\r\nthe fiscal year ending June 30, 1919, we exported about 750 economic\r\ncrop units per capita, which left, roughly, 4,500 economic crop units of\r\nthe 1918 crop for home consumption. During the decade ending 1919 there\r\nhas been an average of about 4,800 economic crop units per capita left\r\nfor home consumption. It was probably necessary to retain more economic\r\ncrop units per capita at home during the last decade than during the\r\n’80’s, because of the smaller live stock production per capita.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of production per farm, there has been a tremendous\r\nincrease every decade. As an average of 1880–1889, the production per\r\nfarm was 66,420 units, as compared with 67,990 units for the 1890–1899\r\ndecade, 71,600 units for the 1900–1909 decade, and 81,000 units for the\r\n1910–1919 decade. In response to the higher price level, the\r\nproductivity of the average farm has constantly been increasing. If both\r\nthe general price level and the price of farm crops had been the same in\r\nthe 1910–1919 decade as in the 1900–1909 decade, the probabilities are\r\nthat the average production per farm would have been about 73,000\r\neconomic crop units instead of 81,000. If by the 1940–1949 decade we\r\nhave a population of 150,000,000, and if Dun’s index number at that time\r\nis $170, it will be necessary to pay at Chicago an average of about\r\n$1.80 for wheat, $1.15 for corn, and 65 cents for oats, in order to call\r\nforth as much production per capita as was called forth by the prices\r\npaid during the past forty years. When Dun’s index number is as low as\r\n$170 (at this writing, in early 1920, it is $244), $1.80 for wheat,\r\netc., will be very high relatively. Rather than pay such a high relative\r\nprice, the consumers of the United States will probably turn to\r\nArgentina and other countries where farmers produce food cheaply by\r\nliving on a lower standard. The position of the United States, rising\r\nout of the world war, whereby she is the creditor nation of the world,\r\nwill favor food importations.\r\n\r\nIt is a commonplace among business men that good crops mean good\r\nbusiness. The effect, however, is not as close as they imagine. The\r\nshort crop of 1901 did not affect the business world till 1903 and 1904.\r\nThe short crops of 1892, 1893 and 1894 did not have full effect till\r\n1895 and 1896. A single crop year which is only slightly below average\r\nmay have no effect whatever on business. But when three crop years\r\naverage below normal, there is almost certain to be some effect on\r\nbusiness. From 1903 to 1919, the correlation between crops and the price\r\nof securities on the stock exchange was about .53. Professor H. L.\r\nMoore, in his book on “Economic Cycles,” finds between crop yields per\r\nacre and pig iron production a correlation coefficient of .72, pig iron\r\nproduction lagging about a year behind crops.\r\n\r\nBig crops do mean good business, altho they mean prosperity to the\r\nfarming class chiefly in an indirect way. A small crop generally brings\r\nfarmers more money than a large crop, but small crops over a period of\r\ntwo or three years cause business depression and this reacts on farmers.\r\n\r\nThe problem of both business men and farmers is to devise some means of\r\ngiving farmers as a class a financial interest in producing big crops\r\nrather than small crops.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Part II\r\n\r\n\r\n       MATHEMATICAL STUDY OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE HOG MARKET\r\n\r\nMathematical formulation of price-making factors is necessary in order\r\nto know when extraordinary or strategic considerations are influencing\r\nthe market. The mathematical methods are highly technical, and in order\r\nto explain most clearly we shall follow a specific problem thru from\r\nbeginning to end.\r\n\r\nThe problem is to determine the price of hogs from hog receipts (supply)\r\nand from business conditions (demand). To represent business conditions,\r\nwe are using bank clearings outside of New York City. The actual figures\r\nfor heavy hog prices at Chicago are given in the Appendix. Hog receipts\r\nat Chicago and bank clearings outside of New York City are given on\r\npages 81 and 82. The problem is to evolve from these figures the law of\r\nhog prices.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to determine the secular or long-time trend of these\r\nfigures. Find, for example, the secular trend of such a series as:\r\n\r\n                                 1901 2\r\n                                 1902 3\r\n                                 1903 2\r\n                                 1904 5\r\n                                 1905 2\r\n                                 1906 6\r\n                                 1907 4\r\n                                 1908 6\r\n                                 1909 6\r\n\r\nFrom looking at these figures, we know that the secular trend slopes\r\nupward, starting with about 2 in 1901, reaching 3 or 4 by 1905, and 5 or\r\n6 by 1909. To express the matter with mathematical accuracy, the method\r\nas applied to this series is as follows: First add all the figures\r\ntogether. Answer in this case, 36. Then divide by the number of\r\nfigures—in this case 9. Thirty-six divided by 9 gives 4, which is the\r\nvalue of the secular trend for 1905, which is the central year.\r\n\r\nThe year 1904 is the −1 year, 1903 the −2 year, 1902 the −3 year, 1901\r\nthe −4 year, and in like manner 1906 is the +1 year, 1907 the +2 year,\r\n1908 the +3 year and 1909 the +4 year. Multiply the minus years by their\r\nrespective values: −1 by 5, −2 by 2, −3 by 3 and −4 by 2, and also the\r\nplus years, +1 by 6, +2 by 4, +3 by 6 and +4 by 6. The totals are −26\r\nand +56, or a net of +30. Now the sum of the squares of −1, −2, −3, −4,\r\n+1, +2, +3 and +4 is 60. Sixty divided into 30 gives .5, which is the\r\nrate of movement of the secular trend each year, or if, as we found, 4\r\nis the secular trend value for 1905, then 3.5 is the value for 1904, 3.0\r\nfor 1903, 2.5 for 1902, and 2.0 for 1901, and in like manner 4.5 for\r\n1906, 5.0 for 1907, 5.5 for 1908 and 6 for 1909. The secular trend is a\r\nstraight line, and the actual goes above and below the secular trend in\r\nmore or less wave-like fashion. In Chart I, the straight line is the\r\nsecular trend of heavy hog prices at Chicago for 1903–1916, and the\r\nirregular line fluctuating above and below is the actual price of heavy\r\nhogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n       BANK CLEARINGS OF THE UNITED STATES OUTSIDE NEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\n                          (7 ciphers omitted)\r\n\r\n

For\r\nexample, hog prices have a normal tendency to go down in the fall of the\r\nyear, whereas bank clearings have an equally normal tendency to go up.\r\nObviously, seasonal trends must be eliminated if such series as hog\r\nprices and bank clearings are to be compared.\r\n\r\nAs an average of the fourteen years from 1903 to 1916, inclusive, heavy\r\nhog prices at Chicago averaged in January, $6.54; February, $6.83;\r\nMarch, $7.22; April, $7.30; May, $7.10; June, $7.10; July, $7.18;\r\nAugust, $7.14; September, $7.29; October, $7.08; November, $6.65;\r\nDecember, $6.55; average for the entire year, $7. On this basis, January\r\nis 93 per cent of the yearly average; February, 98 per cent; March, 103\r\nper cent; April, 104 per cent; May, 101 per cent; June, 101 per cent;\r\nJuly, 103 per cent; August, 102 per cent; September, 104 per cent;\r\nOctober, 101 per cent; November, 95 per cent, and December, 94 per cent.\r\nThe December average for 1902–1915 is $6.30, or 90 per cent. Obviously,\r\nthe seasonal variation as just stated in percentages is affected to some\r\nextent by the secular trend, for the Decembers of 1902–1915 average 90\r\nper cent, and those of 1903–1916 average 94 per cent. Taking the secular\r\ntrend out of our seasonal, or adding 2 points to the early months of the\r\nyear and subtracting 2 points from the last months of the year, we get\r\napproximately: January, 95; February, 99; March, 104; April, 105; May,\r\n102; June, 101; July, 103; August, 102; September, 103; October, 100;\r\nNovember, 94, and December, 92.[6]\r\n\r\nHog receipts at Chicago, in the same manner, have a modified seasonal\r\nfactor of January, 132 per cent; February, 117 per cent; March, 102 per\r\ncent; April, 85 per cent; May, 99 per cent; June, 99 per cent; July, 87\r\nper cent; August, 87 per cent; September, 74 per cent; October, 86 per\r\ncent; November, 103 per cent; December, 129 per cent.\r\n\r\nFor bank clearings outside of New York City, the modified seasonal\r\nfactors are: January, 109; February, 93; March, 104; April, 100; May,\r\n99; June, 97; July, 98; August, 90; September, 93; October, 108;\r\nNovember, 103, and December, 106.\r\n\r\nAfter securing normal seasonal variation, the next step is to modify\r\nsecular trend for seasonal variation. Secular trend of hog prices, as\r\nmodified seasonally, is portrayed in Chart II. The secular trend price\r\nof hogs in January, 1903, is $5.19, which sum, multiplied by the\r\nseasonal factor 96, gives $4.98 as the secular price of hogs modified\r\nseasonally for January, 1903. The actual price was $6.60, or $1.62 above\r\nthe secular modified seasonally, or 31 per cent greater than the secular\r\nprice of $5.19. In this way the percentage of departure for each month\r\nfrom 1903 thru 1916 may be figured. This has been done for hog prices,\r\nhog receipts and bank clearings outside of New York City.[7]\r\n\r\nNow, as it happens, hog receipts are a much more violently fluctuating\r\nseries than bank clearings outside of New York City. To put the series\r\non an even footing, resort is made to what is known as the standard\r\ndeviation. To secure the standard deviation of hog price percentage\r\ndepartures, add up the squares of these departures. The total for the\r\n168 months from 1903 thru 1916 is 31,894, or, dividing by 168, we get\r\n190. The square root of 190 is 13.8, which is the standard deviation of\r\nhog prices. Standard deviation means that the probabilities are that on\r\nthe average not more than one out of three of the series of figures\r\nunder consideration will exceed the standard deviation. Standard\r\ndeviation for hog receipts is 15, and for bank clearings 8.7. This\r\nindicates that hog receipts depart from the secular trend as modified\r\nseasonally with nearly twice as great violence as do bank clearings.\r\n\r\nTo put all three series on the same footing, we divide the percentage\r\ndepartures by the standard deviation, 13.8 in the case of hog prices, 15\r\nin the case of hog receipts, and 8.7 in the case of bank clearings. In\r\nJanuary of 1903, for example, hog prices were greater than the secular\r\nmodified seasonally by 2.3 times the standard deviation; hog receipts\r\nwere less by .3 of the standard deviation, and bank clearings were over\r\nby .9 of the standard deviation. The cycles of the hog prices, hog\r\nreceipts and bank clearings, as secured in this way by reducing for\r\nstandard deviation, are comparable. The results are charted in Charts\r\nIII, IV, V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chart I—Irregular line represents actual Chicago hog prices. Straight\r\n    line represents secular trend.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chart II is identical with Chart I except that the dotted line has\r\n    been added, which represents the secular trend as corrected\r\n    seasonally.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt may be seen from examining these charts that hog prices seem to be\r\nrelated directly to bank clearings and inversely to hog receipts. The\r\nproblem is: Blend hog receipts and bank clearings together in such a way\r\nas to secure hog prices. The mathematical method of approach is by\r\ncorrelation coefficients and lines of regression.\r\n\r\nFirst, a simple illustration of the method of securing correlation\r\ncoefficients:\r\n\r\nTake the two series, A and B, which deviate from their respective means\r\nby the amounts stated in Columns 2 and 3. In Column 1 is the year, which\r\nhas nothing to do with the mathematics of the case. Column 4 is A\r\nsquared, Column 5 is B squared, and Column 6 is A multiplied by B.\r\n\r\n      ═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════╤═════════\r\n          1    │    2    │    3    │    4    │    5    │    6\r\n      ─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n               │    A    │    B    │A squared│B squared│A times B\r\n      ─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n      1901     │       −3│       −5│        9│       25│      +15\r\n      1902     │       −1│       +1│        1│        1│       −1\r\n      1903     │       +2│       +3│        4│        9│       +6\r\n      1904     │       +2│       +1│        4│        1│       +2\r\n         Sum   │         │         │       18│       36│      +22\r\n      ─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\nThe standard deviation of A is the square root of the sum of the A\r\nsquares, or 18, divided by 4. The square root of 18 divided by 4 is 2.1.\r\nStandard deviation of B, in like manner, is 3. The sum of AB divided by\r\n4, or +22 divided by 4, equals +5.5. The correlation coefficient is +5.5\r\ndivided by the standard deviation of A multiplied by the standard\r\ndeviation of B, or 5.5 divided by 6.3, which gives +.87. A correlation\r\ncoefficient of .87 is very high, perfect correlation being 1.\r\nCorrelation over .5 is considered fairly good, especially if there is a\r\nlong list (fifty or more) of figures in each series.\r\n\r\nThe formula for determining A in terms of B is:\r\n\r\n                      A equals r((σ_{a})/(σ_{b}))B\r\n\r\nIn this formula, r is the correlation coefficient and σa is the standard\r\ndeviation of A, and σb is the standard deviation of B. Substituting for\r\nthe specific problem, we get:\r\n\r\n                     A equals .87((2.1)/(3.0))B or\r\n\r\n                     A equals .609 B\r\n\r\nWhen B is −5 we would expect A to be 3.05; when B is +1 we would expect\r\nA to be +.609; when B is +3, we would expect A to be 1.827.\r\n\r\nSuppose now, in addition, that there are three series: A, B and C, and\r\nthat the object is to determine A in terms of B and C. The three series\r\nstand:\r\n\r\n              ════╤════════════╤════════════╤════════════\r\n                  │     A      │     B      │     C\r\n              ────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────\r\n              1901│          −3│          −5│          +2\r\n              1902│          −1│          +1│          +3\r\n              1903│          +2│          +3│          −3\r\n              1904│          +2│          +1│          −2\r\n              ────┴────────────┴────────────┴────────────\r\n\r\nWe already know that the standard deviation of A is 2.1, and of B is\r\n3.0, and that the correlation coefficient between A and B is +.87. Using\r\nthe customary method, we find that the standard deviation of C is 2.55\r\nand that the correlation coefficient of A and C is −.89, and of B and C\r\n−.59. To find A in terms of B and C, we use the following formula:\r\n\r\n  A equals ((r_{ab} − r_{ac}r_{bc})/(1 − r^2_{bc}))((σ_{a})/(σ_{b}))B\r\n  + ((r_{ac} − r_{ab}r_{bc})/(1 − r^2_{bc}))((σ_{a})/(σ_{c}))C\r\n\r\nIn this formula r_{ab} means correlation coefficient between A and B,\r\netc.; σ_{a} means standard deviation of A.\r\n\r\nSubstituting, we get:\r\n\r\n   A equals ((+.87 − .53)/(.65))((2.1)/(3.0))B − ((−.89 +\r\n      .51)/(.65))((2.1)/(2.55))C\r\n or, A equals .37B − .49C\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chart III.

Practically the same method is used with the 168\r\nmonths from 1903 thru 1916, as with the four years which have just been\r\nused for illustration.\r\n\r\nThe standard deviations are 10.1 for hog receipts, 10.5 for hog prices\r\nand 9.8 for bank clearings. The correlation coefficients are +.39\r\nbetween hog prices and bank clearings, +.26 between hog receipts and\r\nbank clearings, and −.4 between hog receipts and hog prices.\r\n\r\nUsing the formula:\r\n\r\n                      A equals r((σ_{a})/(σ_{b}))B\r\n\r\nand allowing A to represent hog prices and B to represent bank\r\nclearings, we get:\r\n\r\n         Hog prices equal .39((10.5)/(0.8)) bank clearings, or\r\n\r\n         Hog prices equal .417 bank clearings\r\n\r\nThis formula is converted back into percentage departures from secular\r\ntrend modified seasonally, and finally into hog prices as affected by\r\nbank clearings. The demand, or bank clearing, price, of hogs as compared\r\nwith the actual is shown in Chart VI.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we get:\r\n\r\n          Hog prices equal −.4((10.5)/(10.1)) hog receipts, or\r\n\r\n          Hog prices equal −.426 hog receipts\r\n\r\nThis formula is converted back into percentage departures from the\r\nsecular trend modified seasonally, and finally into hog prices as\r\naffected by hog receipts. The supply price of hogs as compared with the\r\nactual is shown in Chart VII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chart VI—Dotted line is the demand price of hogs, based on bank\r\n    clearings.

Irregular solid line is actual\r\n    price.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUsing the longer formula on page 89, we get: Hog prices equal .56 bank\r\nclearings minus .56 hog receipts. Or converted into percentage\r\ndepartures from the secular trend corrected seasonally: .90 of bank\r\nclearings in percentage departures minus .51 of hog receipts in\r\npercentage departures equals the percentage which hog prices depart from\r\ntheir secular corrected seasonally. For instance, in January, 1903, bank\r\nclearings were 8 per cent above the secular corrected seasonally, and\r\nhog receipts were 5 per cent below. Eight times .90 plus 5 times .51\r\ngives 9.7 as the percentage which we would expect hog prices to be over\r\ntheir secular corrected seasonally. The secular for January, 1903, was\r\n$5.19; 9.7 per cent of $5.19 gives 50 cents. The secular corrected\r\nseasonally for January, 1903, is $4.98. Add 50 cents to $4.98 and we get\r\n$5.48 as the price which we would have expected heavy hogs to sell at\r\nChicago in January, 1903, on the basis of good business and small hog\r\nreceipts. Actually, hogs sold for $6.60, or $1.12 over the price\r\npredicted by formula.\r\n\r\nThis is done for all the months from 1903 to 1916, and the\r\nsupply-and-demand price of hogs, as derived from hog receipts at Chicago\r\nand bank clearings outside of New York is charted in Chart VIII, in\r\ncomparison with the actual prices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  PREDICTING THE FUTURE OF HOG PRICES\r\n\r\nWe assume that at the present time, and probably for some time to come,\r\nwe are on a basis of 90 per cent above 1913 for hog prices, and 100 per\r\ncent over 1913 in bank clearings. This conclusion is based to some\r\nextent on the reasoning presented in the June monthly supplement of the\r\nHarvard Review of Economic Statistics for the year 1919.\r\n\r\nOn this basis, the secular trend of heavy hog prices at Chicago,\r\nmodified seasonally, should be roughly as follows for the several years\r\nbeginning with 1919: January, $14.35; February, $15.07; March, $15.82;\r\nApril, $15.67; May, $15.22; June, $15.22; July, $15.52; August, $15.22;\r\nSeptember, $15.52; October, $15.07; November, $14.16, and December,\r\n$13.86.[8] This is on the assumption that hog prices and prices\r\ngenerally will have for their normal mean a level 90 per cent above the\r\n1913 level. It is expected that in a rough way hog prices will depart\r\nfrom this level according to the size of hog receipts and the condition\r\nof general business as expressed by bank clearings. (During 1920, and\r\npossibly 1921, heavy exports will doubtless have influence.)\r\n\r\nThe secular trend of bank clearings outside New York, modified\r\nseasonally, for the year beginning with 1919, is taken as: January,\r\n$13,952,000,000; February, $11,648,000,000; March, $13,056,000,000;\r\nApril, $12,800,000,000; May, $12,416,000,000; June, $12,416,000,000;\r\nJuly, $12,544,000,000; August, $11,648,000,000; September, $12,032,000;\r\nOctober, $13,824,000,000; November, $13,440,000,000, and December,\r\n$13,824,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe secular trend of hog receipts at Chicago in millions of pounds,\r\nmodified seasonally, for the period beginning with 1919, is taken as:\r\nJanuary, 184; February, 163; March, 143; April, 118; May, 139; June,\r\n139; July, 121; August, 121; September, 103; October, 120; November,\r\n144, and December, 180.\r\n\r\nBased on the formula as secured in the preceding chapter (hog price\r\nequals .56 bank clearings minus .56 hog receipts), we would expect the\r\nfollowing scale of hog prices in January, when receipts follow the\r\nsecular trend (184,000,000 pounds at Chicago), but bank clearings are\r\nvariable:\r\n\r\n         Bank Clearings in January.     Heavy Hog Prices.\r\n                    $11,000,000,000                     $11.35\r\n                     11,500,000,000                      11.85\r\n                     16,500,000,000                      16.85\r\n\r\nIn like manner, tables may be made up for each month of the year, the\r\nidea being that for each $500,000,000 the bank clearings outside of New\r\nYork are above or below the secular trend seasonally modified, fifty\r\ncents is added to or subtracted from the secular trend hog price\r\nseasonally modified. Thus for April the tables would be:\r\n\r\n          Bank Clearings in April.      Heavy Hog Prices.\r\n                    $ 9,800,000,000                     $12.67\r\n                     12,800,000,000                      15.67\r\n                     15,800,000,000                      18.67\r\n\r\nTaking the tables as worked out for bank clearings and hog prices, we\r\nnext modify for hog receipts. An excess of 33,000,000 pounds of hog\r\nreceipts at Chicago in a month means on the average $1.80 lower prices,\r\nand vice versa. Thus, in January, with bank clearings at\r\n$13,952,000,000, we would expect the following prices with various sizes\r\nof hog receipts:\r\n\r\n         Hog Receipts (in Pounds).      Heavy Hog Prices.\r\n                        162,000,000                     $15.55\r\n                        184,000,000                      14.35\r\n                        195,000,000                      13.75\r\n                        206,000,000                      13.15\r\n                        228,000,000                      11.95\r\n\r\nThe tables herewith give this problem worked out in detail for the\r\nvarious months. It is realized that at this writing, in early 1920,\r\nfinancial matters are still so deranged by the great war that our\r\nsecular trend for bank clearings may be wide of the mark. This is the\r\nbest prediction we can offer at this writing, and we are offering it\r\nfully aware of its weakness, but fully believing that predictions of\r\nthis sort will stimulate more thoro research. It is believed that better\r\nmeasures of demand may eventually be found than bank clearings outside\r\nof New York City, and that better measures of supply may be found than\r\nreceipts at Chicago. Also there is a possibility that the varying size\r\nof exports of hog products should be taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n PRICE OF HEAVY HOGS PER HUNDREDWEIGHT, AS PREDICTED FROM HOG RECEIPTS\r\n

THE MATHEMATICAL METHOD\r\n\r\nSuch a mathematical formula as: Hog prices equal .56 bank clearings—.56\r\nhog receipts must always be applied with common sense. In November of\r\n1914, for instance, hog receipts at Chicago were abnormally small on\r\naccount of foot-and-mouth disease, and in December of the same year they\r\nwere abnormally large for the same reason. Judging from receipts, we\r\nmight have expected heavy hogs to sell for $8.83 in November and $6.44\r\nin December. As a matter of fact, the actual price was $7.50 in November\r\nand $7.10 in December. It was commonly recognized by the trade that hog\r\nreceipts at Chicago in November and December of 1914 were abnormal, and\r\nnot representative of the potential supply in the country at large.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, as in November of 1907, falling prices act to curtail\r\nreceipts. The small receipts in November, 1907, would have indicated a\r\nprice of $6.75, whereas the actual price was $4.90. As a matter of fact,\r\nthere was a large number of hogs that year, and the actual price\r\nreflected the potential supply rather than the temporary supply.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to refine the method considerably. For instance, it may\r\nbe worth while to proceed on the assumption that the relation between\r\nhog prices and hog receipts is best expressed by an equation\r\nrepresentative of a hyperbola or skew curve instead of a straight line.\r\nThe straight line equation, based on the years 1903 to 1915, inclusive,\r\nis:\r\n\r\n              Hog prices equal −.8 −.56 hog receipts.\r\n\r\nThe hyperbola equation for these years is:\r\n\r\n              Hog prices equal −1.24 −.55 hog receipts\r\n                               +.0046 hog receipts\r\n                                 squared.\r\n\r\nThe skew or cubic curve equation is:\r\n\r\n              Hog prices equal −1.18 −.24 hog receipts\r\n                               +.0027 hog receipts squared\r\n                               −.00079 hog receipts cubed.\r\n\r\nUsing these more complex mathematical methods, it is often possible to\r\nexpress the relationships more exactly. But no method, however far\r\nrefined, will take the place of common sense market judgment.\r\nNevertheless, it may be decidedly helpful to a better understanding of\r\nthe normal working of supply and demand to use both hyperbolas and cubic\r\ncurves on occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chart illustrating the straight line as compared with the skew curve,\r\n    for purposes of expressing the relation between hog receipts at\r\n    Chicago and hog prices at Chicago. On the basis of the curve when\r\n    the receipts are 45 per cent less than the secular trend corrected\r\n    seasonally, the price should be 38 per cent over, and when the\r\n    receipts are 42 per cent over the secular trend corrected\r\n    seasonally, the price should be 33 per cent under.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOther refinements of the mathematical study of hog prices may consist in\r\nworking out the correlation coefficients between hog prices and receipts\r\nat six markets or eleven markets instead of using Chicago receipts\r\nalone. Work may be done looking into the relation between hog prices and\r\npotential supply as contrasted with the temporary or month-by-month\r\nsupply. So far as the relation between hog prices and business\r\nconditions is concerned, it should be worth while to work out\r\ncorrelation coefficients between hog prices and the amount of new\r\nbuilding, or hog prices and Dun’s index number. In fact, there are a\r\ngreat many measures of business activities which may possibly measure\r\nthe demand for hogs better than bank clearings outside of New York\r\nCity.[9]\r\n\r\nSome people may think it advisable to work out a correlation and line of\r\nregression illustrating the relation between hog prices and corn prices.\r\nThis has been attempted, but it has been found that after the secular\r\nand seasonal trends are taken out of both corn prices and hog prices\r\nthere is practically no relation between them. It is a curious\r\ncommentary on our present marketing systems that corn prices and hog\r\nprices, while very closely related decade by decade, have very little\r\ninfluence on each other month by month. In other words, changing costs\r\nof production can have practically nothing to do with the month-by-month\r\nchanges in the market price under our present economic system. Unusually\r\nhigh corn prices today are more likely to influence the hog prices of\r\nnext year than the hog prices of today.\r\n\r\nAfter everything has been done which can be done by mathematical method,\r\nthere will still be room for common sense judgment. But such judgment is\r\nbest applied by men wise in market lore, men familiar with the technique\r\nof production, and who also are familiar with such mathematical methods\r\nas are here described.\r\n\r\n\r\n    CONCLUSIONS BASED ON RATIOS AND MATHEMATICS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND\r\n\r\nBy means of corn-hog ratios, it is possible to determine with great\r\naccuracy month by month the production cost of one hundred pounds of hog\r\nflesh. The actual price, however, has been quite different from the\r\ncost-of-production price, except as an average of long periods of time.\r\nThis is indicated by the profit and loss chart on page 32, the black\r\nareas above and below the zero line indicating the departure of the\r\nactual price from the ratio or cost of production price.\r\n\r\nThe actual price heretofore has been determined chiefly by the action of\r\nsupply and demand and not by cost of production. The close agreement\r\nbetween actual price and the supply-and-demand price as based on a\r\nformula derived from bank clearings and hog receipts is shown on page\r\n96. In the chart on page 107 are presented the cost-of-production price\r\nbased on ratios and the supply-and-demand price as based on bank\r\nclearings and hog receipts.\r\n\r\nThe ratio or cost-of-production price is much steadier than the\r\nsupply-and-demand price. If the farmers could arrange with the packers\r\nfor a price more nearly representing the cost-of-production or ratio\r\nprice, it is obvious that the supply of hogs might be considerably\r\nsteadied. Once farmers realize that neither excessive profits nor\r\nexcessive losses are to be expected in the hog business, they will\r\nsteady down to producing about the same number of hogs each year, and\r\nthey will send them to market in a uniform stream, instead of in\r\nirregular spurts.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are always uncertainties in the way of weather,\r\ndisease, etc. Hot, dry weather in July and August may curtail the corn\r\ncrop and shoot up the price of corn and the cost of producing hogs. Such\r\nhot, dry weather immediately increases the cost of producing hogs. The\r\npackers, heretofore, have been either unable or unwilling to pay a price\r\nfor hogs sufficient to cover the increased cost of production caused by\r\nthe hot, dry weather, and as a result they have been compelled to pay\r\nmore than cost of production a year or so later. Why shouldn’t the\r\npackers and farmers constantly educate the public to pay the\r\ncost-of-production price? Tell the public that the drouth and high corn\r\nprices have increased the cost of producing hogs, and the price must be\r\nincreased to prevent a shortage next year. Why shouldn’t the farmers try\r\nto find a way to regulate the supply with an iron hand, in an endeavor\r\nto maintain approximately the cost-of-production price at all times?\r\nThis means willingness to lower the price of hogs in years when the corn\r\ncrop is large, as well as ability to raise the price in years of a short\r\ncorn crop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dotted line represents the supply-and-demand price of hogs as derived\r\n    from bank clearings and hog receipts. Solid line represents cost of\r\n    producing hogs, based on corn-hog ratios.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUnquestionably there are vagaries in the consuming demand for pork which\r\nmight make the payment of a cost-of-production price difficult for a\r\ntime. It is believed, however, that powerful corn belt farmers’\r\norganizations working in co-operation with the packers should be able to\r\neducate consumers to the cost-of-production idea, and so far as seasonal\r\nvagaries in the demand are concerned, the farmers and packers should be\r\nable to come to an agreement providing for paying rather more than the\r\ndemand price for hogs in times of poor demand and rather less than the\r\ndemand price for hogs in times of good demand, in an effort to make\r\nprice meet cost of production rather than temporary demand\r\nidiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nIt is realized that the difficulties in the way of paying cost of\r\nproduction at all times are even greater than here indicated. The idea,\r\nin fact, runs counter to the _laissez faire_, competitive price system\r\nunder which business is conducted today. It is believed, however, that\r\nin the future more and more attention must be paid to production and\r\nless and less to price manipulation. To this end, products must be sold\r\nat all times as nearly as possible at the cost-of-production price.\r\nThere must be no prospect of unusual profit or unusual loss in the\r\nproduction of staple products. We are now referring to industries as a\r\nwhole. It is inevitable, of course, that certain individuals will make\r\ngreat profits and others will incur losses, even in years when the\r\ncost-of-production or ratio price is paid. Full consideration must\r\nalways be given to the physical facts and to special emergencies as they\r\narise. Standard ratios representing cost of production for an industry\r\nmay suddenly be rendered out-of-date by a new invention. New situations\r\nmust be recognized frankly, but at all times the guiding motive should\r\nbe to pay the cost-of-production price, in order that supply and demand\r\nmay operate more smoothly.\r\n\r\nTo give the cost of production price broader sway in our price system\r\ndoes not necessarily involve governmental control. The first step is\r\neducation in price judging. Even in the grade schools and country\r\nschools, ratio methods of price judgment should be taught. In high\r\nschools the matter may be carried farther, and it is suggested that not\r\nonly should the ratio method of price judging be taught in high school,\r\nbut also the practical use of correlation coefficients and lines of\r\nregression in determining prices from business conditions and the\r\nsupply. In college (and the colleges have been most neglectful in this\r\nmatter) specific problems should be worked out in great detail. Students\r\nin such classes should have access to adding machines, calculating\r\nmachines, rechentaffels, and other modern devices for making\r\ncalculations easy and accurate. But the most important thing of all just\r\nnow is adequate research by colleges, by experiment stations, and by\r\ngovernmental departments. The government and market agencies must\r\ncontinue to improve their statistical records, and research students\r\nmust study these records with all the refinements of statistical method.\r\n\r\nAn excellent start along this line has been made by the Harvard\r\nUniversity Committee on Economic Research. This committee seems to be\r\nconcerned altogether with the industrial world. It is essential that the\r\nagricultural world be given similar service.\r\n\r\nThe object of it all is to discover the best possible kind of machinery\r\nthru which the law of supply and demand may work to the end that violent\r\nfluctuations in supply and demand may be reduced to the lowest possible\r\npoint consistent with changing weather and unforeseeable accidents. The\r\npresent price system is not perfect; it can be improved. But before\r\nimprovements can be made, the present system must be studied with the\r\ngreatest thoroness. The great weakness of the present price system is\r\nthat the men who operate it are concerned chiefly with making the\r\ngreatest possible profit, and not at all with making the law of supply\r\nand demand operate smoothly on a price level roughly equivalent to cost\r\nof production.\r\n\r\nThe highest purpose of our price system should be to tell producers\r\ntruthfully what to do in the future, instead of capitalizing a temporary\r\nsupply and demand situation to the advantage of certain bright\r\nspeculators. The $4.50 price for hogs in January of 1908 was a lie so\r\nfar as it guided the future action of hog producers. So also was the $11\r\nprice in March of 1910. Both prices told the approximate truth about a\r\ntemporary supply-and-demand situation. But both were fundamentally lies.\r\nOur whole _laissez faire_ system is full of lies of this sort. Surely we\r\nhave enough in the way of legitimate physical handicaps such as weather\r\nand pests so that we should be willing to run our price system more\r\ntruthfully.\r\n\r\nSo far as farmers are concerned, the object of studies of this kind is,\r\nfirst, to play the price game as well as capital and labor; and, second,\r\nto co-operate with capital and labor to enforce prices roughly\r\nequivalent to cost of production, to the end that supply and demand may\r\noperate more smoothly.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that greater emphasis on “cost-of-production price”\r\nand less emphasis on “supply-and-demand price” will result in gradually\r\nreplacing most business men with production engineers and statistical\r\neconomists. Business men have had profit as their sole motive. What we\r\nneed is production engineers whose chief concern is production methods,\r\nand statistical economists who are able to understand the delicate\r\ninter-relations of different industries. It is believed that there is in\r\nmost men a desire to do their work well, and that this desire will find\r\nmore complete expression, to the benefit of the bulk of the people,\r\nunder the guidance of men whose supreme motive is not profit but\r\ntechnical understanding and love of the work to be done. All this\r\nconcerns the farmer, to the extent that when the industrial world shifts\r\nto this kind of basis, he may be more certain of a stable price for his\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nSubstituting production engineers and statistical economists for\r\nbusiness men means doing away with the chance of excessive gains and\r\nexcessive losses. And this is proper so far as production of and trade\r\nin staple products is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe only place where the commercial imagination of the old-fashioned\r\nrisk-taking business men has legitimate place is in working with things\r\nwhich are not staple, such as theaters, luxuries, newspapers, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n           SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE TABLES IN THE APPENDIX\r\n\r\nThe man who studies the figures as to receipts, prices, etc., as they\r\nunroll day by day and month by month in the great central markets\r\ngradually develops market judgment. Of course, there is more in the\r\nmarket than figures, but a thoro understanding of statistical\r\nrelationships, of normal seasonal trends, etc., is necessary before one\r\ncan fully appreciate the extraordinary or strategical considerations\r\nwhich are occasionally involved.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that those who are really interested in prices should\r\nfill in month by month in the blank tables the figures as they become\r\navailable. Sources of current figures are the Market Reporter, published\r\nweekly by the United States Department of Agriculture; the daily live\r\nstock papers published at the great central markets; the Monthly Crop\r\nReporters, published by the United States Department of Agriculture,\r\nand, so far as retail prices are concerned, the monthly publications of\r\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is hoped that eventually the Bureau\r\nof Markets of the United States Department of Agriculture will have\r\navailable exceedingly valuable figures. At present, however, the Bureau\r\nof Markets figures are practically worthless because they have not been\r\ncontinued long enough to have sufficient background to enable anyone to\r\njudge them properly.\r\n\r\nThe effort has been made in the prices here collected to cover the\r\nperiod immediately preceding the war quite thoroly, in order that those\r\nwho are interested may work out normal pre-war relationships.\r\n\r\nIn all price questions, the problem of grade is involved. Gradually the\r\ngrade classifications have been made more and more scientific, but even\r\nto this day there is haziness in certain products, notably cattle. It is\r\nbelieved, therefore, that the cattle prices are more unreliable than any\r\nother. Scientific grading of cattle is possible, and will be adopted as\r\nsoon as the producers are in position to demand it.\r\n\r\nMarket figures furnish the laboratory of economics. It is believed that\r\nit is as essential for students at agricultural colleges to do\r\nlaboratory work in economics as it is for them to spend such a large\r\npart of their time in the chemical, zoological or botanical\r\nlaboratories. When the agricultural students judge marketable live\r\nstock, it is suggested that they be required to estimate the weight,\r\ngrade, dressing percentage and probable Chicago price. An ingenious\r\nteacher, who is familiar with economics and market grades of grain and\r\nlive stock, can think of many devices to bring home to his students the\r\nfact that the market is a living thing, yet subject to certain laws\r\nwhich are almost as exact as Mendel’s law of inheritance.\r\n\r\nThe author will appreciate being informed of any mistakes in the\r\nfigures. Great pains have been taken to make them accurate, but it is\r\ninevitable that a few mistakes will creep in.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following gives a description of grades and sources of information\r\nfor some of the products for which figures are given in the tables of\r\nthe Appendix:\r\n\r\n\r\n                      HEAVY HOG PRICES AT CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From 1896 to date, heavy hog prices, as compiled by Chas. A. S.\r\n  McCracken for the Chicago Drovers’ Journal Year Book, have been used.\r\n  From 1881 to 1895, inclusive, the average of the range of Chicago hog\r\n  prices, as compiled by the Cincinnati Price Current, has been used.\r\n  Properly speaking, these prices refer more nearly to average hogs than\r\n  to heavy hogs. Previous to 1881, prices have been compiled from the\r\n  Chicago Board of Trade Reports, the grade known as heavy packers and\r\n  shippers being used so far as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CORN PRICES AT CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  No. 2 mixed has been used thruout. From 1880 to 1916, inclusive, the\r\n  average of the high and low for the month has been taken. Since\r\n  January, 1917, each day of the month has been averaged. Previous to\r\n  1880, averages were taken either weekly or semi-monthly. All figures\r\n  are derived either from the Howard-Bartels Red Book or the Chicago\r\n  Board of Trade Reports. The two sources generally agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OATS PRICES AT CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Previous to 1876, the grade known as No. 1 was chiefly used. Since\r\n  1876, No. 2, Standard or Contract oats has been used. Previous to\r\n  1881, averages were taken weekly or semi-monthly. Since 1881, the high\r\n  and low for the month have been averaged. Previous to 1881, Chicago\r\n  Board of Trade Reports were used. Since 1881, the Howard-Bartels Red\r\n  Books have been used, which quote practically the same figures as the\r\n  Board of Trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                        WHEAT PRICES AT CHICAGO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Previous to 1883, the grade known as No. 2 Spring was used, weekly or\r\n  semi-monthly averages being taken from the Chicago Board of Trade\r\n  Reports. From 1883 to 1903, inclusive, there is a slight confusion in\r\n  grades, but the No. 2 Spring is used chiefly, averages of high and low\r\n  for the month being taken from the Howard-Bartels Red Book.\r\n\r\n  From 1904 to 1913, inclusive, prices are based on No. 2 Red and No. 1\r\n  Northern, the high of the one and the low of the other being used.\r\n  From 1914 on, prices are based on No. 2 Red, No. 2 Hard and No. 1\r\n  Northern, the highest of the highest-priced grade and the lowest of\r\n  the lowest-priced grade being averaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LIVE STOCK PRICES AND RECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Practically all of the live stock figures since 1903 have been\r\n  compiled from the Chicago Drovers’ Journal Year Books. Mr. Chas. A. S.\r\n  McCracken has compiled the price figures from actual transactions day\r\n  by day in the stockyards for the past thirty years, and is still with\r\n  the Drovers’ Journal. The original source for live stock receipts is\r\n  the stock yards companies, but we have used the reports of the\r\n  Drovers’ Journal. For the years 1903, 1904 and 1905, for receipts at\r\n  six markets, we have used figures furnished by Mr. M. F. Horine,\r\n  statistician for the Chicago Union Stock Yards. These figures seem to\r\n  be comparable with the figures for the later years, except in the case\r\n  of cattle, where there is evidently some confusion in the counting of\r\n  calves. The cattle receipts at six markets, as published by 1903, 1904\r\n  and 1905 reports, are about 8 per cent too large to be truly\r\n  comparable with the later years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RETAIL PRICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Retail price figures are taken from the publications of the Bureau of\r\n  Labor Statistics. Concerning the significance of these figures, the\r\n  following statement of Royal Meeker, Commissioner of Labor Statistics,\r\n  is of value: “We secure retail prices of 44 articles of food from 50\r\n  cities on the 15th of each month. The stores selected are those\r\n  patronized by wage-earners. The goods carried are standard grades and\r\n  brands. The Bureau requests that these grades and brands be uniform\r\n  thruout the year, as nearly as possible. Some of these stores are\r\n  ‘cash-and-carry,’ and some of them deliver, depending on the locality\r\n  in which they are situated. The Bureau makes every effort to have each\r\n  city represented by a sufficient number of stores so the prices\r\n  published for that city will represent the average prices charged to\r\n  the wage-earner. Of course, the chances are that there will be\r\n  differences, as we do not carry either the high-class stores or the\r\n  cut-rate stores.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CHICAGO HEAVY HOG

As a\r\nmatter of interest, a few future contract prices are averaged. It will\r\nbe noted that the future prices differ considerably from the cash prices\r\nuntil the date of the delivery month draws near, when the future and the\r\ncash prices become almost identical. Before the war, the future contract\r\nsystem worked very well, but during the war it was rather\r\nunsatisfactory. There is an interesting field of study in the seasonal\r\ntrend of northern wheat (spring) as compared with red wheat (winter).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                JANUARY.\r\n\r\n

suggested that those who are especially interested in a study of\r\n  speculative markets read “Braces’ Organized Speculation,” or “Emery’s\r\n  Speculation on the Stock and Produce Exchanges of the United States.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The following defense of the functions of the Board of Trade was\r\n  compiled by Mr. John R. Mauff, the secretary: “The Chicago Board of\r\n  Trade has exclusive characteristics, indispensable to the welfare of\r\n  the producer and consumer. It offers the producer a constant and\r\n  infallible fluctuating market, determined and regulated by the\r\n  inexorable law of supply and demand. It creates, thru the trading of\r\n  its large membership, representing the various branches of\r\n  agricultural and industrial activity, continuous quotations that are\r\n  collected and distributed generally and without cost to the public.\r\n  There is thus presented the opportunity for the producer to determine\r\n  at any time the exact value of his products. A further advantage is\r\n  that he can dispose of these products at any time by making a future\r\n  delivery ‘hedging’ contract to suit his inclination, regardless of bad\r\n  roads or transportation problems. Another benefit is the large and\r\n  daily open competitive market in which to display his wares before a\r\n  multitude of buyers simultaneously, obviating the otherwise impossible\r\n  task of communicating with this diversity of demands by personal\r\n  effort. Protected at all times by a set of rules and regulations\r\n  holding its members to a strict accountability for their proper\r\n  conduct as commission merchants; mandatory for suspension or expulsion\r\n  for any violation of the ethics of trade. Having at their disposal a\r\n  variety of ability only to be found in a large membership, insuring in\r\n  this way proper handling and attention because a strenuous effort is\r\n  always masterful and resourceful where competition is rife.\r\n  Dissemination of statistics relating to agriculture; the benefits of\r\n  terminal elevators equipped with modern apparatus for the proper care\r\n  of sample grades. For consumers, car shortage and other transportation\r\n  difficulties productive of business stagnation overcome by the\r\n  opportunity to purchase for future delivery the raw material where\r\n  ‘short’ sales of product call for protection. Consummation of\r\n  contracts possible at all times thru the machinery of a market for\r\n  future delivery at continuous prices, reliable to the fluctuations of\r\n  a small fraction—one-eighth of one cent per bushel. In conclusion, and\r\n  by no means least, the facilities offered for thus establishing value\r\n  in every part of the United States, with no inequality because of\r\n  geographical location, and so a death knell to the exploiters of\r\n  producers and consumers because of this knowledge widely disseminated\r\n  and so easy of understanding.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The skew curves of supply and demand, as derived by H. L. Moore, in\r\n  his book on “Economic Cycles,” furnish mathematical proof of this\r\n  statement so far as corn and oats are concerned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The chart printed in connection with the chapter, “Pork Exports, the\r\n  Barometer of Corn Belt Prosperity,” gives forty-four years of profit\r\n  and loss areas per acre of corn in the twelve north central states,\r\n  the method used being the ratio method as described in the above.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  It may be argued that the price of hogs determines the price of corn,\r\n  and that the price of corn determines the price of land. This to a\r\n  large extent may be true, and yet not interfere with the usefulness of\r\n  the ratio method for purposes of price judging.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  The link relative method of finding the normal seasonal variation, as\r\n  used by Warren M. Persons, in the January, 1919, Review of Economic\r\n  Statistics, is far more difficult than the method here used, and for\r\n  our purposes is not worth while.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Warren M. Persons, in a footnote on page 35 of the January, 1919,\r\n  Review of Economic Statistics, expresses the method of ascertaining\r\n  percentage departure from the secular trend in mathematical symbols as\r\n  follows: “Let the original series beginning with January be X_{1},\r\n  X_{2}, X_{3}, ... X_{n}, the ordinates of secular trend be O_{1},\r\n  O_{2}, O_{3}, ... O_{n}, and the adjusted indices of seasonal\r\n  variation for twelve months be S_{1}, S_{2}, S_{3}, ... S_{12} per\r\n  cent, respectively. Then the items for secular trend and seasonal\r\n  variation are:\r\n\r\n  X_{1} − S_{1}O_{1}/O_{1}, X_{2} − S_{2}O_{2}/O_{2}, X_{3} −\r\n  S_{3}O_{3}/O_{3}, ... X_{3} − S_{1}O_{13}/O_{13} etc.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  These figures are based on seasonal correction factors as follows:\r\n  January, 96; February, 100; March, 105; April, 104; May, 101; June,\r\n  101; July, 103; August, 101; September, 103; October, 100; November,\r\n  94; December, 92. These factors are practically the same as those used\r\n  on page 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Since the chapter, “Limitations of the Mathematical Method,” was\r\n  written, it has been discovered that hog receipts at eleven markets\r\n  are a more accurate indicator of hog prices than receipts at Chicago,\r\n  and that prices of Connelsville coke are a better indicator of the\r\n  demand for hogs than bank clearings outside New York City. The\r\n  multiple coefficient of correlation between hog prices on the one hand\r\n  and Chicago hog receipts and bank clearings outside New York City on\r\n  the other hand is .65, whereas between hog prices and hog receipts at\r\n  eleven markets and coke prices the multiple coefficient of correlation\r\n  is .70.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  This is the average as given in the Drovers’ Journal Year Books. It\r\n  evidently is a weighted average based on varying receipts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  This is a simple average and not strictly comparable with the Chicago\r\n  averages, which are weighted on the basis of varying receipts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Interpolated from Kansas City market, on account of foot-and-mouth\r\n  disease closing Chicago market.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  Omaha prices, 1903 to 1907, inclusive; Chicago prices after 1907.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Prices for both wheat and corn are taken from the Year Books of the\r\n  Rosario Board of Trade. Rosario is the Chicago of Argentina. The\r\n  Argentine unit of weight, the quintal, is taken as equivalent to 3.67\r\n  bushels of wheat and 3.936 bushels of corn. The Argentine dollar is\r\n  taken as equivalent to 42.6 cents. After July of 1918, prices are\r\n  taken from the International Institute of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Flour exports converted into wheat at the rate of four and one-half\r\n  bushels of wheat to a barrel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  These figures, previous to 1917, were taken from charts furnished by\r\n  Dr. L. D. H. Weld, of Swift Company. Since 1917, the source has been\r\n  the Daily Trade Bulletin of Howard Bartels. The top price for the\r\n  month is used in every case.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  These figures, previous to 1917, were taken from charts furnished by\r\n  Dr. L. D. H. Weld, of Swift Company. Since 1917, the source has been\r\n  the Daily Trade Bulletin of Howard Bartels. The top price for the\r\n  month is used in every case.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  The Milwaukee prices were compiled by Professor F. A. Pearson, of the\r\n  University of Illinois, from the reports of the Western Feed Bureau.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  From 1860 to 1890, wages are based on the investigation made by the\r\n  Department of Labor for the senate committee investigating prices and\r\n  wages, and reported in Senate Document 1394. Wages from 1890 to 1907\r\n  are based on Bulletin 77 of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and from\r\n  1907 to 1913 on unpublished data of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\r\n  prepared for the San Francisco Exposition. Figures since 1913 are\r\n  estimated from reports of manufacturing establishments in New York\r\n  state, reports of wages paid by the United States Steel Corporation,\r\n  and reports of the Bureau of Labor Statistics as to wages existing in\r\n  cotton goods, men’s clothing, lumber, and furniture industries. It is\r\n  believed that the figures since 1913 are roughly accurate, but that\r\n  they may have to be revised to make them comparable with the preceding\r\n  series. Farm-hand wages are derived from the December, 1919, Monthly\r\n  Crop Reporter of the Bureau of Crop Estimates.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n ● Typos fixed; non-standard spelling and dialect retained.\r\n ● Enclosed italics font in _underscores_.\r\n ● Enclosed blackletter font in =equals=.",
