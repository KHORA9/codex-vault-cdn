As I feel that the opportunities which I\r\nenjoyed of studying the Natural History of the different countries we\r\nvisited, have been wholly due to Captain Fitz Roy, I hope I may here be\r\npermitted to repeat my expression of gratitude to him; and to add that,\r\nduring the five years we were together, I received from him the most\r\ncordial friendship and steady assistance.  Both to Captain Fitz Roy and\r\nto all the Officers of the Beagle [1] I shall ever feel most thankful\r\nfor the undeviating kindness with which I was treated during our long\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains, in the form of a Journal, a history of our\r\nvoyage, and a sketch of those observations in Natural History and\r\nGeology, which I think will possess some interest for the general\r\nreader.  I have in this edition largely condensed and corrected some\r\nparts, and have added a little to others, in order to render the volume\r\nmore fitted for popular reading; but I trust that naturalists will\r\nremember, that they must refer for details to the larger publications\r\nwhich comprise the scientific results of the Expedition.  The Zoology\r\nof the Voyage of the Beagle includes an account of the Fossil Mammalia,\r\nby Professor Owen; of the Living Mammalia, by Mr. Waterhouse; of the\r\nBirds, by Mr. Gould; of the Fish, by the Rev. L. Jenyns; and of the\r\nReptiles, by Mr. Bell.  I have appended to the descriptions of each\r\nspecies an account of its habits and range.  These works, which I owe\r\nto the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above distinguished\r\nauthors, could not have been undertaken, had it not been for the\r\nliberality of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury, who,\r\nthrough the representation of the Right Honourable the Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer, have been pleased to grant a sum of one thousand pounds\r\ntowards defraying part of the expenses of publication.\r\n\r\nI have myself published separate volumes on the 'Structure and\r\nDistribution of Coral Reefs;' on the 'Volcanic Islands visited during\r\nthe Voyage of the Beagle;' and on the 'Geology of South America.' The\r\nsixth volume of the 'Geological Transactions' contains two papers of\r\nmine on the Erratic Boulders and Volcanic Phenomena of South America.\r\nMessrs. Waterhouse, Walker, Newman, and White, have published several\r\nable papers on the Insects which were collected, and I trust that many\r\nothers will hereafter follow.  The plants from the southern parts of\r\nAmerica will be given by Dr. J. Hooker, in his great work on the Botany\r\nof the Southern Hemisphere.  The Flora of the Galapagos Archipelago is\r\nthe subject of a separate memoir by him, in the 'Linnean Transactions.'\r\nThe Reverend Professor Henslow has published a list of the plants\r\ncollected by me at the Keeling Islands; and the Reverend J. M. Berkeley\r\nhas described my cryptogamic plants.\r\n\r\nI shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the great assistance which I\r\nhave received from several other naturalists, in the course of this and\r\nmy other works; but I must be here allowed to return my most sincere\r\nthanks to the Reverend Professor Henslow, who, when I was an\r\nundergraduate at Cambridge, was one chief means of giving me a taste\r\nfor Natural History,--who, during my absence, took charge of the\r\ncollections I sent home, and by his correspondence directed my\r\nendeavours,--and who, since my return, has constantly rendered me every\r\nassistance which the kindest friend could offer.\r\n\r\nDOWN, BROMLEY, KENT, June 9, 1845\r\n\r\n[1] I must take this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to Mr.\r\nBynoe, the surgeon of the Beagle, for his very kind attention to me\r\nwhen I was ill at Valparaiso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE BEAGLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nST. JAGO--CAPE DE VERD ISLANDS\r\n\r\nPorto Praya--Ribeira Grande--Atmospheric Dust with Infusoria--Habits of\r\na Sea-slug and Cuttle-fish--St. Paul's Rocks, non-volcanic--Singular\r\nIncrustations--Insects the first Colonists of Islands--Fernando\r\nNoronha--Bahia--Burnished Rocks--Habits of a Diodon--Pelagic Confervae\r\nand Infusoria--Causes of discoloured Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER having been twice driven back by heavy southwestern gales, Her\r\nMajesty's ship Beagle, a ten-gun brig, under the command of Captain\r\nFitz Roy, R. N., sailed from Devonport on the 27th of December, 1831.\r\nThe object of the expedition was to complete the survey of Patagonia\r\nand Tierra del Fuego, commenced under Captain King in 1826 to 1830,--to\r\nsurvey the shores of Chile, Peru, and of some islands in the\r\nPacific--and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the\r\nWorld. On the 6th of January we reached Teneriffe, but were prevented\r\nlanding, by fears of our bringing the cholera: the next morning we saw\r\nthe sun rise behind the rugged outline of the Grand Canary island, and\r\nsuddenly illuminate the Peak of Teneriffe, whilst the lower parts were\r\nveiled in fleecy clouds.  This was the first of many delightful days\r\nnever to be forgotten. On the 16th of January, 1832, we anchored at\r\nPorto Praya, in St. Jago, the chief island of the Cape de Verd\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Porto Praya, viewed from the sea, wears a desolate\r\naspect.  The volcanic fires of a past age, and the scorching heat of a\r\ntropical sun, have in most places rendered the soil unfit for\r\nvegetation.  The country rises in successive steps of table-land,\r\ninterspersed with some truncate conical hills, and the horizon is\r\nbounded by an irregular chain of more lofty mountains.  The scene, as\r\nbeheld through the hazy atmosphere of this climate, is one of great\r\ninterest; if, indeed, a person, fresh from sea, and who has just\r\nwalked, for the first time, in a grove of cocoa-nut trees, can be a\r\njudge of anything but his own happiness.  The island would generally be\r\nconsidered as very uninteresting, but to anyone accustomed only to an\r\nEnglish landscape, the novel aspect of an utterly sterile land\r\npossesses a grandeur which more vegetation might spoil.  A single green\r\nleaf can scarcely be discovered over wide tracts of the lava plains;\r\nyet flocks of goats, together with a few cows, contrive to exist.  It\r\nrains very seldom, but during a short portion of the year heavy\r\ntorrents fall, and immediately afterwards a light vegetation springs\r\nout of every crevice.  This soon withers; and upon such naturally\r\nformed hay the animals live.  It had not now rained for an entire year.\r\nWhen the island was discovered, the immediate neighbourhood of Porto\r\nPraya was clothed with trees, [1] the reckless destruction of which has\r\ncaused here, as at St. Helena, and at some of the Canary islands,\r\nalmost entire sterility.  The broad, flat-bottomed valleys, many of\r\nwhich serve during a few days only in the season as water-courses, are\r\nclothed with thickets of leafless bushes.  Few living creatures inhabit\r\nthese valleys.  The commonest bird is a kingfisher (Dacelo Iagoensis),\r\nwhich tamely sits on the branches of the castor-oil plant, and thence\r\ndarts on grasshoppers and lizards.  It is brightly coloured, but not so\r\nbeautiful as the European species: in its flight, manners, and place of\r\nhabitation, which is generally in the driest valley, there is also a\r\nwide difference.\r\n\r\nOne day, two of the officers and myself rode to Ribeira Grande, a\r\nvillage a few miles eastward of Porto Praya.  Until we reached the\r\nvalley of St. Martin, the country presented its usual dull brown\r\nappearance; but here, a very small rill of water produces a most\r\nrefreshing margin of luxuriant vegetation.  In the course of an hour we\r\narrived at Ribeira Grande, and were surprised at the sight of a large\r\nruined fort and cathedral.  This little town, before its harbour was\r\nfilled up, was the principal place in the island: it now presents a\r\nmelancholy, but very picturesque appearance.  Having procured a black\r\nPadre for a guide, and a Spaniard who had served in the Peninsular war\r\nas an interpreter, we visited a collection of buildings, of which an\r\nancient church formed the principal part.  It is here the governors and\r\ncaptain-generals of the islands have been buried.  Some of the\r\ntombstones recorded dates of the sixteenth century. [2]\r\n\r\nThe heraldic ornaments were the only things in this retired place that\r\nreminded us of Europe.  The church or chapel formed one side of a\r\nquadrangle, in the middle of which a large clump of bananas were\r\ngrowing.  On another side was a hospital, containing about a dozen\r\nmiserable-looking inmates.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the Venda to eat our dinners.  A considerable number of\r\nmen, women, and children, all as black as jet, collected to watch us.\r\nOur companions were extremely merry; and everything we said or did was\r\nfollowed by their hearty laughter.  Before leaving the town we visited\r\nthe cathedral.  It does not appear so rich as the smaller church, but\r\nboasts of a little organ, which sent forth singularly inharmonious\r\ncries.  We presented the black priest with a few shillings, and the\r\nSpaniard, patting him on the head, said, with much candour, he thought\r\nhis colour made no great difference.  We then returned, as fast as the\r\nponies would go, to Porto Praya.\r\n\r\nAnother day we rode to the village of St. Domingo, situated near the\r\ncentre of the island.  On a small plain which we crossed, a few stunted\r\nacacias were growing; their tops had been bent by the steady\r\ntrade-wind, in a singular manner--some of them even at right angles to\r\ntheir trunks. The direction of the branches was exactly N. E. by N.,\r\nand S. W. by S., and these natural vanes must indicate the prevailing\r\ndirection of the force of the trade-wind.  The travelling had made so\r\nlittle impression on the barren soil, that we here missed our track,\r\nand took that to Fuentes.  This we did not find out till we arrived\r\nthere; and we were afterwards glad of our mistake.  Fuentes is a pretty\r\nvillage, with a small stream; and everything appeared to prosper well,\r\nexcepting, indeed, that which ought to do so most--its inhabitants. The\r\nblack children, completely naked, and looking very wretched, were\r\ncarrying bundles of firewood half as big as their own bodies.\r\n\r\nNear Fuentes we saw a large flock of guinea-fowl--probably fifty or\r\nsixty in number.  They were extremely wary, and could not be\r\napproached.  They avoided us, like partridges on a rainy day in\r\nSeptember, running with their heads cocked up; and if pursued, they\r\nreadily took to the wing.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of St. Domingo possesses a beauty totally unexpected, from\r\nthe prevalent gloomy character of the rest of the island.  The village\r\nis situated at the bottom of a valley, bounded by lofty and jagged\r\nwalls of stratified lava. The black rocks afford a most striking\r\ncontrast with the bright green vegetation, which follows the banks of a\r\nlittle stream of clear water.  It happened to be a grand feast-day, and\r\nthe village was full of people.  On our return we overtook a party of\r\nabout twenty young black girls, dressed in excellent taste; their black\r\nskins and snow-white linen being set off by coloured turbans and large\r\nshawls.  As soon as we approached near, they suddenly all turned round,\r\nand covering the path with their shawls, sung with great energy a wild\r\nsong, beating time with their hands upon their legs. We threw them some\r\nvintems, which were received with screams of laughter, and we left them\r\nredoubling the noise of their song.\r\n\r\nOne morning the view was singularly clear; the distant mountains being\r\nprojected with the sharpest outline on a heavy bank of dark blue\r\nclouds.  Judging from the appearance, and from similar cases in\r\nEngland, I supposed that the air was saturated with moisture.  The\r\nfact, however, turned out quite the contrary.  The hygrometer gave a\r\ndifference of 29.6 degs., between the temperature of the air, and the\r\npoint at which dew was precipitated.  This difference was nearly double\r\nthat which I had observed on the previous mornings.  This unusual\r\ndegree of atmospheric dryness was accompanied by continual flashes of\r\nlightning.  Is it not an uncommon case, thus to find a remarkable\r\ndegree of aerial transparency with such a state of weather?\r\n\r\nGenerally the atmosphere is hazy; and this is caused by the falling of\r\nimpalpably fine dust, which was found to have slightly injured the\r\nastronomical instruments.  The morning before we anchored at Porto\r\nPraya, I collected a little packet of this brown-coloured fine dust,\r\nwhich appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the\r\nvane at the mast-head.  Mr. Lyell has also given me four packets of\r\ndust which fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these\r\nislands.  Professor Ehrenberg [3] finds that this dust consists in\r\ngreat part of infusoria with siliceous shields, and of the siliceous\r\ntissue of plants.  In five little packets which I sent him, he has\r\nascertained no less than sixty-seven different organic forms!  The\r\ninfusoria, with the exception of two marine species, are all\r\ninhabitants of fresh-water.  I have found no less than fifteen\r\ndifferent accounts of dust having fallen on vessels when far out in the\r\nAtlantic.  From the direction of the wind whenever it has fallen, and\r\nfrom its having always fallen during those months when the harmattan is\r\nknown to raise clouds of dust high into the atmosphere, we may feel\r\nsure that it all comes from Africa.  It is, however, a very singular\r\nfact, that, although Professor Ehrenberg knows many species of\r\ninfusoria peculiar to Africa, he finds none of these in the dust which\r\nI sent him. On the other hand, he finds in it two species which\r\nhitherto he knows as living only in South America.  The dust falls in\r\nsuch quantities as to dirty everything on board, and to hurt people's\r\neyes; vessels even have run on shore owing to the obscurity of the\r\natmosphere.  It has often fallen on ships when several hundred, and\r\neven more than a thousand miles from the coast of Africa, and at points\r\nsixteen hundred miles distant in a north and south direction.  In some\r\ndust which was collected on a vessel three hundred miles from the land,\r\nI was much surprised to find particles of stone above the thousandth of\r\nan inch square, mixed with finer matter.  After this fact one need not\r\nbe surprised at the diffusion of the far lighter and smaller sporules\r\nof cryptogamic plants.\r\n\r\nThe geology of this island is the most interesting part of its natural\r\nhistory.  On entering the harbour, a perfectly horizontal white band,\r\nin the face of the sea cliff, may be seen running for some miles along\r\nthe coast, and at the height of about forty-five feet above the water.\r\nUpon examination this white stratum is found to consist of calcareous\r\nmatter with numerous shells embedded, most or all of which now exist on\r\nthe neighbouring coast.  It rests on ancient volcanic rocks, and has\r\nbeen covered by a stream of basalt, which must have entered the sea\r\nwhen the white shelly bed was lying at the bottom.  It is interesting\r\nto trace the changes produced by the heat of the overlying lava, on the\r\nfriable mass, which in parts has been converted into a crystalline\r\nlimestone, and in other parts into a compact spotted stone. Where the\r\nlime has been caught up by the scoriaceous fragments of the lower\r\nsurface of the stream, it is converted into groups of beautifully\r\nradiated fibres resembling arragonite. The beds of lava rise in\r\nsuccessive gently-sloping plains, towards the interior, whence the\r\ndeluges of melted stone have originally proceeded.  Within historical\r\ntimes, no signs of volcanic activity have, I believe, been manifested\r\nin any part of St. Jago.  Even the form of a crater can but rarely be\r\ndiscovered on the summits of the many red cindery hills; yet the more\r\nrecent streams can be distinguished on the coast, forming lines of\r\ncliffs of less height, but stretching out in advance of those belonging\r\nto an older series: the height of the cliffs thus affording a rude\r\nmeasure of the age of the streams.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay, I observed the habits of some marine animals.  A large\r\nAplysia is very common.  This sea-slug is about five inches long; and\r\nis of a dirty yellowish colour veined with purple.  On each side of the\r\nlower surface, or foot, there is a broad membrane, which appears\r\nsometimes to act as a ventilator, in causing a current of water to flow\r\nover the dorsal branchiae or lungs.  It feeds on the delicate sea-weeds\r\nwhich grow among the stones in muddy and shallow water; and I found in\r\nits stomach several small pebbles, as in the gizzard of a bird.  This\r\nslug, when disturbed, emits a very fine purplish-red fluid, which\r\nstains the water for the space of a foot around.  Besides this means of\r\ndefence, an acrid secretion, which is spread over its body, causes a\r\nsharp, stinging sensation, similar to that produced by the Physalia, or\r\nPortuguese man-of-war.\r\n\r\nI was much interested, on several occasions, by watching the habits of\r\nan Octopus, or cuttle-fish.  Although common in the pools of water left\r\nby the retiring tide, these animals were not easily caught.  By means\r\nof their long arms and suckers, they could drag their bodies into very\r\nnarrow crevices; and when thus fixed, it required great force to remove\r\nthem.  At other times they darted tail first, with the rapidity of an\r\narrow, from one side of the pool to the other, at the same instant\r\ndiscolouring the water with a dark chestnut-brown ink.  These animals\r\nalso escape detection by a very extraordinary, chameleon-like power of\r\nchanging their colour. They appear to vary their tints according to the\r\nnature of the ground over which they pass: when in deep water, their\r\ngeneral shade was brownish purple, but when placed on the land, or in\r\nshallow water, this dark tint changed into one of a yellowish green.\r\nThe colour, examined more carefully, was a French grey, with numerous\r\nminute spots of bright yellow: the former of these varied in intensity;\r\nthe latter entirely disappeared and appeared again by turns.  These\r\nchanges were effected in such a manner, that clouds, varying in tint\r\nbetween a hyacinth red and a chestnut-brown, [4] were continually\r\npassing over the body.  Any part, being subjected to a slight shock of\r\ngalvanism, became almost black: a similar effect, but in a less degree,\r\nwas produced by scratching the skin with a needle.  These clouds, or\r\nblushes as they may be called, are said to be produced by the alternate\r\nexpansion and contraction of minute vesicles containing variously\r\ncoloured fluids. [5]\r\n\r\nThis cuttle-fish displayed its chameleon-like power both during the act\r\nof swimming and whilst remaining stationary at the bottom.  I was much\r\namused by the various arts to escape detection used by one individual,\r\nwhich seemed fully aware that I was watching it.  Remaining for a time\r\nmotionless, it would then stealthily advance an inch or two, like a cat\r\nafter a mouse; sometimes changing its colour: it thus proceeded, till\r\nhaving gained a deeper part, it darted away, leaving a dusky train of\r\nink to hide the hole into which it had crawled.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for marine animals, with my head about two feet above the\r\nrocky shore, I was more than once saluted by a jet of water,\r\naccompanied by a slight grating noise.  At first I could not think what\r\nit was, but afterwards I found out that it was this cuttle-fish, which,\r\nthough concealed in a hole, thus often led me to its discovery.  That\r\nit possesses the power of ejecting water there is no doubt, and it\r\nappeared to me that it could certainly take good aim by directing the\r\ntube or siphon on the under side of its body.  From the difficulty\r\nwhich these animals have in carrying their heads, they cannot crawl\r\nwith ease when placed on the ground.  I observed that one which I kept\r\nin the cabin was slightly phosphorescent in the dark.\r\n\r\nST. PAUL'S ROCKS.--In crossing the Atlantic we hove-to during the\r\nmorning of February 16th, close to the island of St. Paul's.  This\r\ncluster of rocks is situated in 0 degs. 58' north latitude, and 29\r\ndegs. 15' west longitude.  It is 540 miles distant from the coast of\r\nAmerica, and 350 from the island of Fernando Noronha.  The highest\r\npoint is only fifty feet above the level of the sea, and the entire\r\ncircumference is under three-quarters of a mile.  This small point\r\nrises abruptly out of the depths of the ocean.  Its mineralogical\r\nconstitution is not simple; in some parts the rock is of a cherty, in\r\nothers of a felspathic nature, including thin veins of serpentine.  It\r\nis a remarkable fact, that all the many small islands, lying far from\r\nany continent, in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, with the\r\nexception of the Seychelles and this little point of rock, are, I\r\nbelieve, composed either of coral or of erupted matter.  The volcanic\r\nnature of these oceanic islands is evidently an extension of that law,\r\nand the effect of those same causes, whether chemical or mechanical,\r\nfrom which it results that a vast majority of the volcanoes now in\r\naction stand either near sea-coasts or as islands in the midst of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of St. Paul appear from a distance of a brilliantly white\r\ncolour.  This is partly owing to the dung of a vast multitude of\r\nseafowl, and partly to a coating of a hard glossy substance with a\r\npearly lustre, which is intimately united to the surface of the rocks.\r\nThis, when examined with a lens, is found to consist of numerous\r\nexceedingly thin layers, its total thickness being about the tenth of\r\nan inch.  It contains much animal matter, and its origin, no doubt, is\r\ndue to the action of the rain or spray on the birds' dung.  Below some\r\nsmall masses of guano at Ascension, and on the Abrolhos Islets, I found\r\ncertain stalactitic branching bodies, formed apparently in the same\r\nmanner as the thin white coating on these rocks.  The branching bodies\r\nso closely resembled in general appearance certain nulliporae (a family\r\nof hard calcareous sea-plants), that in lately looking hastily over my\r\ncollection I did not perceive the difference.  The globular extremities\r\nof the branches are of a pearly texture, like the enamel of teeth, but\r\nso hard as just to scratch plate-glass.  I may here mention, that on a\r\npart of the coast of Ascension, where there is a vast accumulation of\r\nshelly sand, an incrustation is deposited on the tidal rocks by the\r\nwater of the sea, resembling, as represented in the woodcut, certain\r\ncryptogamic plants (Marchantiae) often seen on damp walls.  The surface\r\nof the fronds is beautifully glossy; and those parts formed where fully\r\nexposed to the light are of a jet black colour, but those shaded under\r\nledges are only grey. I have shown specimens of this incrustation to\r\nseveral geologists, and they all thought that they were of volcanic or\r\nigneous origin!  In its hardness and translucency--in its polish, equal\r\nto that of the finest oliva-shell--in the bad smell given out, and loss\r\nof colour under the blowpipe--it shows a close similarity with living\r\nsea-shells.  Moreover, in sea-shells, it is known that the parts\r\nhabitually covered and shaded by the mantle of the animal, are of a\r\npaler colour than those fully exposed to the light, just as is the case\r\nwith this incrustation.  When we remember that lime, either as a\r\nphosphate or carbonate, enters into the composition of the hard parts,\r\nsuch as bones and shells, of all living animals, it is an interesting\r\nphysiological fact [6] to find substances harder than the enamel of\r\nteeth, and coloured surfaces as well polished as those of a fresh\r\nshell, reformed through inorganic means from dead organic\r\nmatter--mocking, also, in shape, some of the lower vegetable\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nWe found on St. Paul's only two kinds of birds--the booby and the\r\nnoddy.  The former is a species of gannet, and the latter a tern.  Both\r\nare of a tame and stupid disposition, and are so unaccustomed to\r\nvisitors, that I could have killed any number of them with my\r\ngeological hammer. The booby lays her eggs on the bare rock; but the\r\ntern makes a very simple nest with sea-weed.  By the side of many of\r\nthese nests a small flying-fish was placed; which I suppose, had been\r\nbrought by the male bird for its partner.  It was amusing to watch how\r\nquickly a large and active crab (Graspus), which inhabits the crevices\r\nof the rock, stole the fish from the side of the nest, as soon as we\r\nhad disturbed the parent birds.  Sir W. Symonds, one of the few persons\r\nwho have landed here, informs me that he saw the crabs dragging even\r\nthe young birds out of their nests, and devouring them.  Not a single\r\nplant, not even a lichen, grows on this islet; yet it is inhabited by\r\nseveral insects and spiders.  The following list completes, I believe,\r\nthe terrestrial fauna: a fly (Olfersia) living on the booby, and a tick\r\nwhich must have come here as a parasite on the birds; a small brown\r\nmoth, belonging to a genus that feeds on feathers; a beetle (Quedius)\r\nand a woodlouse from beneath the dung; and lastly, numerous spiders,\r\nwhich I suppose prey on these small attendants and scavengers of the\r\nwater-fowl.  The often repeated description of the stately palm and\r\nother noble tropical plants, then birds, and lastly man, taking\r\npossession of the coral islets as soon as formed, in the Pacific, is\r\nprobably not correct; I fear it destroys the poetry of this story, that\r\nfeather and dirt-feeding and parasitic insects and spiders should be\r\nthe first inhabitants of newly formed oceanic land.\r\n\r\nThe smallest rock in the tropical seas, by giving a foundation for the\r\ngrowth of innumerable kinds of sea-weed and compound animals, supports\r\nlikewise a large number of fish. The sharks and the seamen in the boats\r\nmaintained a constant struggle which should secure the greater share of\r\nthe prey caught by the fishing-lines.  I have heard that a rock near\r\nthe Bermudas, lying many miles out at sea, and at a considerable depth,\r\nwas first discovered by the circumstance of fish having been observed\r\nin the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFERNANDO NORONHA, Feb. 20th.--As far as I was enabled to observe,\r\nduring the few hours we stayed at this place, the constitution of the\r\nisland is volcanic, but probably not of a recent date.  The most\r\nremarkable feature is a conical hill, about one thousand feet high, the\r\nupper part of which is exceedingly steep, and on one side overhangs its\r\nbase.  The rock is phonolite, and is divided into irregular columns. On\r\nviewing one of these isolated masses, at first one is inclined to\r\nbelieve that it has been suddenly pushed up in a semi-fluid state.  At\r\nSt. Helena, however, I ascertained that some pinnacles, of a nearly\r\nsimilar figure and constitution, had been formed by the injection of\r\nmelted rock into yielding strata, which thus had formed the moulds for\r\nthese gigantic obelisks.  The whole island is covered with wood; but\r\nfrom the dryness of the climate there is no appearance of luxuriance.\r\nHalf-way up the mountain, some great masses of the columnar rock,\r\nshaded by laurel-like trees, and ornamented by others covered with fine\r\npink flowers but without a single leaf, gave a pleasing effect to the\r\nnearer parts of the scenery.\r\n\r\nBAHIA, OR SAN SALVADOR.  BRAZIL, Feb. 29th.--The day has passed\r\ndelightfully.  Delight itself, however, is a weak term to express the\r\nfeelings of a naturalist who, for the first time, has wandered by\r\nhimself in a Brazilian forest.  The elegance of the grasses, the\r\nnovelty of the parasitical plants, the beauty of the flowers, the\r\nglossy green of the foliage, but above all the general luxuriance of\r\nthe vegetation, filled me with admiration.  A most paradoxical mixture\r\nof sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood.  The noise\r\nfrom the insects is so loud, that it may be heard even in a vessel\r\nanchored several hundred yards from the shore; yet within the recesses\r\nof the forest a universal silence appears to reign.  To a person fond\r\nof natural history, such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure\r\nthan he can ever hope to experience again.  After wandering about for\r\nsome hours, I returned to the landing-place; but, before reaching it, I\r\nwas overtaken by a tropical storm.  I tried to find shelter under a\r\ntree, which was so thick that it would never have been penetrated by\r\ncommon English rain; but here, in a couple of minutes, a little torrent\r\nflowed down the trunk. It is to this violence of the rain that we must\r\nattribute the verdure at the bottom of the thickest woods: if the\r\nshowers were like those of a colder climate, the greater part would be\r\nabsorbed or evaporated before it reached the ground.  I will not at\r\npresent attempt to describe the gaudy scenery of this noble bay,\r\nbecause, in our homeward voyage, we called here a second time, and I\r\nshall then have occasion to remark on it.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole coast of Brazil, for a length of at least 2000 miles,\r\nand certainly for a considerable space inland, wherever solid rock\r\noccurs, it belongs to a granitic formation. The circumstance of this\r\nenormous area being constituted of materials which most geologists\r\nbelieve to have been crystallized when heated under pressure, gives\r\nrise to many curious reflections.  Was this effect produced beneath the\r\ndepths of a profound ocean? or did a covering of strata formerly extend\r\nover it, which has since been removed? Can we believe that any power,\r\nacting for a time short of infinity, could have denuded the granite\r\nover so many thousand square leagues?\r\n\r\nOn a point not far from the city, where a rivulet entered the sea, I\r\nobserved a fact connected with a subject discussed by Humboldt. [7] At\r\nthe cataracts of the great rivers Orinoco, Nile, and Congo, the\r\nsyenitic rocks are coated by a black substance, appearing as if they\r\nhad been polished with plumbago.  The layer is of extreme thinness; and\r\non analysis by Berzelius it was found to consist of the oxides of\r\nmanganese and iron.  In the Orinoco it occurs on the rocks periodically\r\nwashed by the floods, and in those parts alone where the stream is\r\nrapid; or, as the Indians say, \"the rocks are black where the waters\r\nare white.\" Here the coating is of a rich brown instead of a black\r\ncolour, and seems to be composed of ferruginous matter alone.  Hand\r\nspecimens fail to give a just idea of these brown burnished stones\r\nwhich glitter in the sun's rays.  They occur only within the limits of\r\nthe tidal waves; and as the rivulet slowly trickles down, the surf must\r\nsupply the polishing power of the cataracts in the great rivers.  In\r\nlike manner, the rise and fall of the tide probably answer to the\r\nperiodical inundations; and thus the same effects are produced under\r\napparently different but really similar circumstances.  The origin,\r\nhowever, of these coatings of metallic oxides, which seem as if\r\ncemented to the rocks, is not understood; and no reason, I believe, can\r\nbe assigned for their thickness remaining the same.\r\n\r\nOne day I was amused by watching the habits of the Diodon antennatus,\r\nwhich was caught swimming near the shore.  This fish, with its flabby\r\nskin, is well known to possess the singular power of distending itself\r\ninto a nearly spherical form.  After having been taken out of water for\r\na short time, and then again immersed in it, a considerable quantity\r\nboth of water and air is absorbed by the mouth, and perhaps likewise by\r\nthe branchial orifices.  This process is effected by two methods: the\r\nair is swallowed, and is then forced into the cavity of the body, its\r\nreturn being prevented by a muscular contraction which is externally\r\nvisible: but the water enters in a gentle stream through the mouth,\r\nwhich is kept wide open and motionless; this latter action must,\r\ntherefore, depend on suction.  The skin about the abdomen is much\r\nlooser than that on the back; hence, during the inflation, the lower\r\nsurface becomes far more distended than the upper; and the fish, in\r\nconsequence, floats with its back downwards.  Cuvier doubts whether the\r\nDiodon in this position is able to swim; but not only can it thus move\r\nforward in a straight line, but it can turn round to either side.  This\r\nlatter movement is effected solely by the aid of the pectoral fins; the\r\ntail being collapsed, and not used.  From the body being buoyed up with\r\nso much air, the branchial openings are out of water, but a stream\r\ndrawn in by the mouth constantly flows through them.\r\n\r\nThe fish, having remained in this distended state for a short time,\r\ngenerally expelled the air and water with considerable force from the\r\nbranchial apertures and mouth.  It could emit, at will, a certain\r\nportion of the water, and it appears, therefore, probable that this\r\nfluid is taken in partly for the sake of regulating its specific\r\ngravity.  This Diodon possessed several means of defence.  It could\r\ngive a severe bite, and could eject water from its mouth to some\r\ndistance, at the same time making a curious noise by the movement of\r\nits jaws.  By the inflation of its body, the papillae, with which the\r\nskin is covered, become erect and pointed.  But the most curious\r\ncircumstance is, that it secretes from the skin of its belly, when\r\nhandled, a most beautiful carmine-red fibrous matter, which stains\r\nivory and paper in so permanent a manner that the tint is retained with\r\nall its brightness to the present day: I am quite ignorant of the\r\nnature and use of this secretion.  I have heard from Dr. Allan of\r\nForres, that he has frequently found a Diodon, floating alive and\r\ndistended, in the stomach of the shark, and that on several occasions\r\nhe has known it eat its way, not only through the coats of the stomach,\r\nbut through the sides of the monster, which has thus been killed.  Who\r\nwould ever have imagined that a little soft fish could have destroyed\r\nthe great and savage shark?\r\n\r\nMarch 18th.--We sailed from Bahia.  A few days afterwards, when not far\r\ndistant from the Abrolhos Islets, my attention was called to a\r\nreddish-brown appearance in the sea.  The whole surface of the water,\r\nas it appeared under a weak lens, seemed as if covered by chopped bits\r\nof hay, with their ends jagged.  These are minute cylindrical\r\nconfervae, in bundles or rafts of from twenty to sixty in each.  Mr.\r\nBerkeley informs me that they are the same species (Trichodesmium\r\nerythraeum) with that found over large spaces in the Red Sea, and\r\nwhence its name of Red Sea is derived. [8] Their numbers must be\r\ninfinite: the ship passed through several bands of them, one of which\r\nwas about ten yards wide, and, judging from the mud-like colour of the\r\nwater, at least two and a half miles long.  In almost every long voyage\r\nsome account is given of these confervae.  They appear especially\r\ncommon in the sea near Australia; and off Cape Leeuwin I found an\r\nallied but smaller and apparently different species.  Captain Cook, in\r\nhis third voyage, remarks, that the sailors gave to this appearance the\r\nname of sea-sawdust.\r\n\r\nNear Keeling Atoll, in the Indian Ocean, I observed many little masses\r\nof confervae a few inches square, consisting of long cylindrical\r\nthreads of excessive thinness, so as to be barely visible to the naked\r\neye, mingled with other rather larger bodies, finely conical at both\r\nends.  Two of these are shown in the woodcut united together.  They\r\nvary in length from .04 to .06, and even to .08 of an inch in length;\r\nand in diameter from .006 to .008 of an inch.  Near one extremity of\r\nthe cylindrical part, a green septum, formed of granular matter, and\r\nthickest in the middle, may generally be seen.  This, I believe, is the\r\nbottom of a most delicate, colourless sac, composed of a pulpy\r\nsubstance, which lines the exterior case, but does not extend within\r\nthe extreme conical points.  In some specimens, small but perfect\r\nspheres of brownish granular matter supplied the places of the septa;\r\nand I observed the curious process by which they were produced.  The\r\npulpy matter of the internal coating suddenly grouped itself into\r\nlines, some of which assumed a form radiating from a common centre; it\r\nthen continued, with an irregular and rapid movement, to contract\r\nitself, so that in the course of a second the whole was united into a\r\nperfect little sphere, which occupied the position of the septum at one\r\nend of the now quite hollow case. The formation of the granular sphere\r\nwas hastened by any accidental injury.  I may add, that frequently a\r\npair of these bodies were attached to each other, as represented above,\r\ncone beside cone, at that end where the septum occurs.\r\n\r\nI will add here a few other observations connected with the\r\ndiscoloration of the sea from organic causes.  On the coast of Chile, a\r\nfew leagues north of Concepcion, the Beagle one day passed through\r\ngreat bands of muddy water, exactly like that of a swollen river; and\r\nagain, a degree south of Valparaiso, when fifty miles from the land,\r\nthe same appearance was still more extensive.  Some of the water placed\r\nin a glass was of a pale reddish tint; and, examined under a\r\nmicroscope, was seen to swarm with minute animalcula darting about, and\r\noften exploding.  Their shape is oval, and contracted in the middle by\r\na ring of vibrating curved ciliae.  It was, however, very difficult to\r\nexamine them with care, for almost the instant motion ceased, even\r\nwhile crossing the field of vision, their bodies burst.  Sometimes both\r\nends burst at once, sometimes only one, and a quantity of coarse,\r\nbrownish, granular matter was ejected.  The animal an instant before\r\nbursting expanded to half again its natural size; and the explosion\r\ntook place about fifteen seconds after the rapid progressive motion had\r\nceased: in a few cases it was preceded for a short interval by a\r\nrotatory movement on the longer axis.  About two minutes after any\r\nnumber were isolated in a drop of water, they thus perished. The\r\nanimals move with the narrow apex forwards, by the aid of their\r\nvibratory ciliae, and generally by rapid starts. They are exceedingly\r\nminute, and quite invisible to the naked eye, only covering a space\r\nequal to the square of the thousandth of an inch.  Their numbers were\r\ninfinite; for the smallest drop of water which I could remove contained\r\nvery many.  In one day we passed through two spaces of water thus\r\nstained, one of which alone must have extended over several square\r\nmiles.  What incalculable numbers of these microscopical animals!  The\r\ncolour of the water, as seen at some distance, was like that of a river\r\nwhich has flowed through a red clay district, but under the shade of\r\nthe vessel's side it was quite as dark as chocolate.  The line where\r\nthe red and blue water joined was distinctly defined. The weather for\r\nsome days previously had been calm, and the ocean abounded, to an\r\nunusual degree, with living creatures. [9]\r\n\r\nIn the sea around Tierra del Fuego, and at no great distance from the\r\nland, I have seen narrow lines of water of a bright red colour, from\r\nthe number of crustacea, which somewhat resemble in form large prawns.\r\nThe sealers call them whale-food.  Whether whales feed on them I do not\r\nknow; but terns, cormorants, and immense herds of great unwieldy seals\r\nderive, on some parts of the coast, their chief sustenance from these\r\nswimming crabs.  Seamen invariably attribute the discoloration of the\r\nwater to spawn; but I found this to be the case only on one occasion.\r\nAt the distance of several leagues from the Archipelago of the\r\nGalapagos, the ship sailed through three strips of a dark yellowish, or\r\nmud-like water; these strips were some miles long, but only a few yards\r\nwide, and they were separated from the surrounding water by a sinuous\r\nyet distinct margin. The colour was caused by little gelatinous balls,\r\nabout the fifth of an inch in diameter, in which numerous minute\r\nspherical ovules were imbedded: they were of two distinct kinds, one\r\nbeing of a reddish colour and of a different shape from the other.  I\r\ncannot form a conjecture as to what two kinds of animals these\r\nbelonged.  Captain Colnett remarks, that this appearance is very common\r\namong the Galapagos Islands, and that the directions of the bands\r\nindicate that of the currents; in the described case, however, the line\r\nwas caused by the wind.  The only other appearance which I have to\r\nnotice, is a thin oily coat on the water which displays iridescent\r\ncolours.  I saw a considerable tract of the ocean thus covered on the\r\ncoast of Brazil; the seamen attributed it to the putrefying carcase of\r\nsome whale, which probably was floating at no great distance.  I do not\r\nhere mention the minute gelatinous particles, hereafter to be referred\r\nto, which are frequently dispersed throughout the water, for they are\r\nnot sufficiently abundant to create any change of colour.\r\n\r\nThere are two circumstances in the above accounts which appear\r\nremarkable: first, how do the various bodies which form the bands with\r\ndefined edges keep together?  In the case of the prawn-like crabs,\r\ntheir movements were as co-instantaneous as in a regiment of soldiers;\r\nbut this cannot happen from anything like voluntary action with the\r\novules, or the confervae, nor is it probable among the infusoria.\r\nSecondly, what causes the length and narrowness of the bands?  The\r\nappearance so much resembles that which may be seen in every torrent,\r\nwhere the stream uncoils into long streaks the froth collected in the\r\neddies, that I must attribute the effect to a similar action either of\r\nthe currents of the air or sea.  Under this supposition we must believe\r\nthat the various organized bodies are produced in certain favourable\r\nplaces, and are thence removed by the set of either wind or water.  I\r\nconfess, however, there is a very great difficulty in imagining any one\r\nspot to be the birthplace of the millions of millions of animalcula and\r\nconfervae: for whence come the germs at such points?--the parent bodies\r\nhaving been distributed by the winds and waves over the immense ocean.\r\nBut on no other hypothesis can I understand their linear grouping.  I\r\nmay add that Scoresby remarks that green water abounding with pelagic\r\nanimals is invariably found in a certain part of the Arctic Sea.\r\n\r\n[1] I state this on the authority of Dr. E. Dieffenbach, in his German\r\ntranslation of the first edition of this Journal.\r\n\r\n[2] The Cape de Verd Islands were discovered in 1449. There was a\r\ntombstone of a bishop with the date of 1571; and a crest of a hand and\r\ndagger, dated 1497.\r\n\r\n[3] I must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness\r\nwith which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my\r\nspecimens.  I have sent (June, 1845) a full account of the falling of\r\nthis dust to the Geological Society.\r\n\r\n[4] So named according to Patrick Symes's nomenclature.\r\n\r\n[5] See Encyclop. of Anat. and Physiol., article Cephalopoda\r\n\r\n[6] Mr. Horner and Sir David Brewster have described (Philosophical\r\nTransactions, 1836, p. 65) a singular \"artificial substance resembling\r\nshell.\" It is deposited in fine, transparent, highly polished,\r\nbrown-coloured laminae, possessing peculiar optical properties, on the\r\ninside of a vessel, in which cloth, first prepared with glue and then\r\nwith lime, is made to revolve rapidly in water.  It is much softer,\r\nmore transparent, and contains more animal matter, than the natural\r\nincrustation at Ascension; but we here again see the strong tendency\r\nwhich carbonate of lime and animal matter evince to form a solid\r\nsubstance allied to shell.\r\n\r\n[7] Pers.

Peron, the\r\ndistinguished naturalist, in the Voyage aux Terres Australes, gives no\r\nless than twelve references to voyagers who have alluded to the\r\ndiscoloured waters of the sea (vol. ii. p. 239).

I gladly accepted his kind offer of allowing\r\nme to accompany him.\r\n\r\nApril 8th.--Our party amounted to seven.  The first stage was very\r\ninteresting.  The day was powerfully hot, and as we passed through the\r\nwoods, everything was motionless, excepting the large and brilliant\r\nbutterflies, which lazily fluttered about.  The view seen when crossing\r\nthe hills behind Praia Grande was most beautiful; the colours were\r\nintense, and the prevailing tint a dark blue; the sky and the calm\r\nwaters of the bay vied with each other in splendour. After passing\r\nthrough some cultivated country, we entered a forest, which in the\r\ngrandeur of all its parts could not be exceeded.  We arrived by midday\r\nat Ithacaia; this small village is situated on a plain, and round the\r\ncentral house are the huts of the negroes.  These, from their regular\r\nform and position, reminded me of the drawings of the Hottentot\r\nhabitations in Southern Africa.  As the moon rose early, we determined\r\nto start the same evening for our sleeping-place at the Lagoa Marica.\r\nAs it was growing dark we passed under one of the massive, bare, and\r\nsteep hills of granite which are so common in this country.  This spot\r\nis notorious from having been, for a long time, the residence of some\r\nrunaway slaves, who, by cultivating a little ground near the top,\r\ncontrived to eke out a subsistence.  At length they were discovered,\r\nand a party of soldiers being sent, the whole were seized with the\r\nexception of one old woman, who, sooner than again be led into slavery,\r\ndashed herself to pieces from the summit of the mountain.  In a Roman\r\nmatron this would have been called the noble love of freedom: in a poor\r\nnegress it is mere brutal obstinacy.  We continued riding for some\r\nhours.  For the few last miles the road was intricate, and it passed\r\nthrough a desert waste of marshes and lagoons.  The scene by the dimmed\r\nlight of the moon was most desolate.  A few fireflies flitted by us;\r\nand the solitary snipe, as it rose, uttered its plaintive cry.  The\r\ndistant and sullen roar of the sea scarcely broke the stillness of the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nApril 9th.--We left our miserable sleeping-place before sunrise.  The\r\nroad passed through a narrow sandy plain, lying between the sea and the\r\ninterior salt lagoons.  The number of beautiful fishing birds, such as\r\negrets and cranes, and the succulent plants assuming most fantastical\r\nforms, gave to the scene an interest which it would not otherwise have\r\npossessed.  The few stunted trees were loaded with parasitical plants,\r\namong which the beauty and delicious fragrance of some of the orchideae\r\nwere most to be admired. As the sun rose, the day became extremely hot,\r\nand the reflection of the light and heat from the white sand was very\r\ndistressing.  We dined at Mandetiba; the thermometer in the shade being\r\n84 degs.  The beautiful view of the distant wooded hills, reflected in\r\nthe perfectly calm water of an extensive lagoon, quite refreshed us. As\r\nthe venda [1] here was a very good one, and I have the pleasant, but\r\nrare remembrance, of an excellent dinner, I will be grateful and\r\npresently describe it, as the type of its class.  These houses are\r\noften large, and are built of thick upright posts, with boughs\r\ninterwoven, and afterwards plastered.  They seldom have floors, and\r\nnever glazed windows; but are generally pretty well roofed. Universally\r\nthe front part is open, forming a kind of verandah, in which tables and\r\nbenches are placed.  The bed-rooms join on each side, and here the\r\npassenger may sleep as comfortably as he can, on a wooden platform,\r\ncovered by a thin straw mat.  The venda stands in a courtyard, where\r\nthe horses are fed.  On first arriving it was our custom to unsaddle\r\nthe horses and give them their Indian corn; then, with a low bow, to\r\nask the senhor to do us the favour to give up something to eat.\r\n\"Anything you choose, sir,\" was his usual answer. For the few first\r\ntimes, vainly I thanked providence for having guided us to so good a\r\nman.  The conversation proceeding, the case universally became\r\ndeplorable.  \"Any fish can you do us the favour of giving ?\"--\"Oh! no,\r\nsir.\"--\"Any soup?\"--\"No, sir.\"--\"Any bread?\"--\"Oh! no, sir.\"--\"Any\r\ndried meat?\"--\"Oh! no, sir.\" If we were lucky, by waiting a couple of\r\nhours, we obtained fowls, rice, and farinha.  It not unfrequently\r\nhappened, that we were obliged to kill, with stones, the poultry for\r\nour own supper.  When, thoroughly exhausted by fatigue and hunger, we\r\ntimorously hinted that we should be glad of our meal, the pompous, and\r\n(though true) most unsatisfactory answer was, \"It will be ready when it\r\nis ready.\" If we had dared to remonstrate any further, we should have\r\nbeen told to proceed on our journey, as being too impertinent.  The\r\nhosts are most ungracious and disagreeable in their manners; their\r\nhouses and their persons are often filthily dirty; the want of the\r\naccommodation of forks, knives, and spoons is common; and I am sure no\r\ncottage or hovel in England could be found in a state so utterly\r\ndestitute of every comfort.  At Campos Novos, however, we fared\r\nsumptuously; having rice and fowls, biscuit, wine, and spirits, for\r\ndinner; coffee in the evening, and fish with coffee for breakfast.  All\r\nthis, with good food for the horses, only cost 2s. 6d. per head.  Yet\r\nthe host of this venda, being asked if he knew anything of a whip which\r\none of the party had lost, gruffly answered, \"How should I know? why\r\ndid you not take care of it?--I suppose the dogs have eaten it.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving Mandetiba, we continued to pass through an intricate wilderness\r\nof lakes; in some of which were fresh, in others salt water shells.  Of\r\nthe former kinds, I found a Limnaea in great numbers in a lake, into\r\nwhich, the inhabitants assured me that the sea enters once a year, and\r\nsometimes oftener, and makes the water quite salt.  I have no doubt\r\nmany interesting facts, in relation to marine and fresh water animals,\r\nmight be observed in this chain of lagoons, which skirt the coast of\r\nBrazil.  M. Gay [2] has stated that he found in the neighbourhood of\r\nRio, shells of the marine genera solen and mytilus, and fresh water\r\nampullariae, living together in brackish water.  I also frequently\r\nobserved in the lagoon near the Botanic Garden, where the water is only\r\na little less salt than in the sea, a species of hydrophilus, very\r\nsimilar to a water-beetle common in the ditches of England: in the same\r\nlake the only shell belonged to a genus generally found in estuaries.\r\n\r\nLeaving the coast for a time, we again entered the forest. The trees\r\nwere very lofty, and remarkable, compared with those of Europe, from\r\nthe whiteness of their trunks.  I see by my note-book, \"wonderful and\r\nbeautiful, flowering parasites,\" invariably struck me as the most novel\r\nobject in these grand scenes.  Travelling onwards we passed through\r\ntracts of pasturage, much injured by the enormous conical ants' nests,\r\nwhich were nearly twelve feet high.  They gave to the plain exactly the\r\nappearance of the mud volcanos at Jorullo, as figured by Humboldt.  We\r\narrived at Engenhodo after it was dark, having been ten hours on\r\nhorseback.  I never ceased, during the whole journey, to be surprised\r\nat the amount of labour which the horses were capable of enduring; they\r\nappeared also to recover from any injury much sooner than those of our\r\nEnglish breed.  The Vampire bat is often the cause of much trouble, by\r\nbiting the horses on their withers.  The injury is generally not so\r\nmuch owing to the loss of blood, as to the inflammation which the\r\npressure of the saddle afterwards produces.  The whole circumstance has\r\nlately been doubted in England; I was therefore fortunate in being\r\npresent when one (Desmodus d'orbignyi, Wat.) was actually caught on a\r\nhorse's back.  We were bivouacking late one evening near Coquimbo, in\r\nChile, when my servant, noticing that one of the horses was very\r\nrestive, went to see what was the matter, and fancying he could\r\ndistinguish something, suddenly put his hand on the beast's withers,\r\nand secured the vampire.  In the morning the spot where the bite had\r\nbeen inflicted was easily distinguished from being slightly swollen and\r\nbloody.  The third day afterwards we rode the horse, without any ill\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nApril 13th.--After three days' travelling we arrived at Socego, the\r\nestate of Senhor Manuel Figuireda, a relation of one of our party.  The\r\nhouse was simple, and, though like a barn in form, was well suited to\r\nthe climate.  In the sitting-room gilded chairs and sofas were oddly\r\ncontrasted with the whitewashed walls, thatched roof, and windows\r\nwithout glass.  The house, together with the granaries, the stables,\r\nand workshops for the blacks, who had been taught various trades,\r\nformed a rude kind of quadrangle; in the centre of which a large pile\r\nof coffee was drying.  These buildings stand on a little hill,\r\noverlooking the cultivated ground, and surrounded on every side by a\r\nwall of dark green luxuriant forest.  The chief produce of this part of\r\nthe country is coffee.  Each tree is supposed to yield annually, on an\r\naverage, two pounds; but some give as much as eight.  Mandioca or\r\ncassada is likewise cultivated in great quantity.  Every part of this\r\nplant is useful; the leaves and stalks are eaten by the horses, and the\r\nroots are ground into a pulp, which, when pressed dry and baked, forms\r\nthe farinha, the principal article of sustenance in the Brazils.  It is\r\na curious, though well-known fact, that the juice of this most\r\nnutritious plant is highly poisonous.  A few years ago a cow died at\r\nthis Fazenda, in consequence of having drunk some of it. Senhor\r\nFiguireda told me that he had planted, the year before, one bag of\r\nfeijao or beans, and three of rice; the former of which produced\r\neighty, and the latter three hundred and twenty fold.  The pasturage\r\nsupports a fine stock of cattle, and the woods are so full of game that\r\na deer had been killed on each of the three previous days.  This\r\nprofusion of food showed itself at dinner, where, if the tables did not\r\ngroan, the guests surely did; for each person is expected to eat of\r\nevery dish.  One day, having, as I thought, nicely calculated so that\r\nnothing should go away untasted, to my utter dismay a roast turkey and\r\na pig appeared in all their substantial reality.  During the meals, it\r\nwas the employment of a man to drive out of the room sundry old hounds,\r\nand dozens of little black children, which crawled in together, at\r\nevery opportunity.  As long as the idea of slavery could be banished,\r\nthere was something exceedingly fascinating in this simple and\r\npatriarchal style of living: it was such a perfect retirement and\r\nindependence from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nAs soon as any stranger is seen arriving, a large bell is set tolling,\r\nand generally some small cannon are fired.  The event is thus announced\r\nto the rocks and woods, but to nothing else.  One morning I walked out\r\nan hour before daylight to admire the solemn stillness of the scene; at\r\nlast, the silence was broken by the morning hymn, raised on high by the\r\nwhole body of the blacks; and in this manner their daily work is\r\ngenerally begun.  On such fazendas as these, I have no doubt the slaves\r\npass happy and contented lives.  On Saturday and Sunday they work for\r\nthemselves, and in this fertile climate the labour of two days is\r\nsufficient to support a man and his family for the whole week.\r\n\r\nApril 14th.--Leaving Socego, we rode to another estate on the Rio\r\nMacae, which was the last patch of cultivated ground in that direction.\r\nThe estate was two and a half miles long, and the owner had forgotten\r\nhow many broad.  Only a very small piece had been cleared, yet almost\r\nevery acre was capable of yielding all the various rich productions of\r\na tropical land.  Considering the enormous area of Brazil, the\r\nproportion of cultivated ground can scarcely be considered as anything,\r\ncompared to that which is left in the state of nature: at some future\r\nage, how vast a population it will support!  During the second day's\r\njourney we found the road so shut up, that it was necessary that a man\r\nshould go ahead with a sword to cut away the creepers.  The forest\r\nabounded with beautiful objects; among which the tree ferns, though not\r\nlarge, were, from their bright green foliage, and the elegant curvature\r\nof their fronds, most worthy of admiration. In the evening it rained\r\nvery heavily, and although the thermometer stood at 65 degs., I felt\r\nvery cold.  As soon as the rain ceased, it was curious to observe the\r\nextraordinary evaporation which commenced over the whole extent of the\r\nforest.  At the height of a hundred feet the hills were buried in a\r\ndense white vapour, which rose like columns of smoke from the most\r\nthickly wooded parts, and especially from the valleys.  I observed this\r\nphenomenon on several occasions. I suppose it is owing to the large\r\nsurface of foliage, previously heated by the sun's rays.\r\n\r\nWhile staying at this estate, I was very nearly being an eye-witness to\r\none of those atrocious acts which can only take place in a slave\r\ncountry.  Owing to a quarrel and a lawsuit, the owner was on the point\r\nof taking all the women and children from the male slaves, and selling\r\nthem separately at the public auction at Rio.  Interest, and not any\r\nfeeling of compassion, prevented this act.  Indeed, I do not believe\r\nthe inhumanity of separating thirty families, who had lived together\r\nfor many years, even occurred to the owner.  Yet I will pledge myself,\r\nthat in humanity and good feeling he was superior to the common run of\r\nmen. It may be said there exists no limit to the blindness of interest\r\nand selfish habit.  I may mention one very trifling anecdote, which at\r\nthe time struck me more forcibly than any story of cruelty.  I was\r\ncrossing a ferry with a negro, who was uncommonly stupid.  In\r\nendeavouring to make him understand, I talked loud, and made signs, in\r\ndoing which I passed my hand near his face.  He, I suppose, thought I\r\nwas in a passion, and was going to strike him; for instantly, with a\r\nfrightened look and half-shut eyes, he dropped his hands.  I shall\r\nnever forget my feelings of surprise, disgust, and shame, at seeing a\r\ngreat powerful man afraid even to ward off a blow, directed, as he\r\nthought, at his face.  This man had been trained to a degradation lower\r\nthan the slavery of the most helpless animal.\r\n\r\nApril 18th.--In returning we spent two days at Socego, and I employed\r\nthem in collecting insects in the forest.  The greater number of trees,\r\nalthough so lofty, are not more than three or four feet in\r\ncircumference.  There are, of course, a few of much greater dimensions.\r\nSenhor Manuel was then making a canoe 70 feet in length from a solid\r\ntrunk, which had originally been 110 feet long, and of great thickness.\r\nThe contrast of palm trees, growing amidst the common branching kinds,\r\nnever fails to give the scene an intertropical character.  Here the\r\nwoods were ornamented by the Cabbage Palm--one of the most beautiful of\r\nits family.  With a stem so narrow that it might be clasped with the\r\ntwo hands, it waves its elegant head at the height of forty or fifty\r\nfeet above the ground.  The woody creepers, themselves covered by other\r\ncreepers, were of great thickness: some which I measured were two feet\r\nin circumference.  Many of the older trees presented a very curious\r\nappearance from the tresses of a liana hanging from their boughs, and\r\nresembling bundles of hay.  If the eye was turned from the world of\r\nfoliage above, to the ground beneath, it was attracted by the extreme\r\nelegance of the leaves of the ferns and mimosae. The latter, in some\r\nparts, covered the surface with a brushwood only a few inches high.  In\r\nwalking across these thick beds of mimosae, a broad track was marked by\r\nthe change of shade, produced by the drooping of their sensitive\r\npetioles. It is easy to specify the individual objects of admiration in\r\nthese grand scenes; but it is not possible to give an adequate idea of\r\nthe higher feelings of wonder, astonishment, and devotion, which fill\r\nand elevate the mind.\r\n\r\nApril 19th.--Leaving Socego, during the two first days, we retraced our\r\nsteps.  It was very wearisome work, as the road generally ran across a\r\nglaring hot sandy plain, not far from the coast.  I noticed that each\r\ntime the horse put its foot on the fine siliceous sand, a gentle\r\nchirping noise was produced.  On the third day we took a different\r\nline, and passed through the gay little village of Madre de Deos. This\r\nis one of the principal lines of road in Brazil; yet it was in so bad a\r\nstate that no wheeled vehicle, excepting the clumsy bullock-wagon,\r\ncould pass along.  In our whole journey we did not cross a single\r\nbridge built of stone; and those made of logs of wood were frequently\r\nso much out of repair, that it was necessary to go on one side to avoid\r\nthem. All distances are inaccurately known.  The road is often marked\r\nby crosses, in the place of milestones, to signify where human blood\r\nhas been spilled.  On the evening of the 23rd we arrived at Rio, having\r\nfinished our pleasant little excursion.\r\n\r\nDuring the remainder of my stay at Rio, I resided in a cottage at\r\nBotofogo Bay.  It was impossible to wish for anything more delightful\r\nthan thus to spend some weeks in so magnificent a country.  In England\r\nany person fond of natural history enjoys in his walks a great\r\nadvantage, by always having something to attract his attention; but in\r\nthese fertile climates, teeming with life, the attractions are so\r\nnumerous, that he is scarcely able to walk at all.\r\n\r\nThe few observations which I was enabled to make were almost\r\nexclusively confined to the invertebrate animals.  The existence of a\r\ndivision of the genus Planaria, which inhabits the dry land, interested\r\nme much.  These animals are of so simple a structure, that Cuvier has\r\narranged them with the intestinal worms, though never found within the\r\nbodies of other animals.  Numerous species inhabit both salt and fresh\r\nwater; but those to which I allude were found, even in the drier parts\r\nof the forest, beneath logs of rotten wood, on which I believe they\r\nfeed.  In general form they resemble little slugs, but are very much\r\nnarrower in proportion, and several of the species are beautifully\r\ncoloured with longitudinal stripes.  Their structure is very simple:\r\nnear the middle of the under or crawling surface there are two small\r\ntransverse slits, from the anterior one of which a funnel-shaped and\r\nhighly irritable mouth can be protruded.  For some time after the rest\r\nof the animal was completely dead from the effects of salt water or any\r\nother cause, this organ still retained its vitality.\r\n\r\nI found no less than twelve different species of terrestrial Planariae\r\nin different parts of the southern hemisphere. [3] Some specimens which\r\nI obtained at Van Dieman's Land, I kept alive for nearly two months,\r\nfeeding them on rotten wood.  Having cut one of them transversely into\r\ntwo nearly equal parts, in the course of a fortnight both had the shape\r\nof perfect animals.  I had, however, so divided the body, that one of\r\nthe halves contained both the inferior orifices, and the other, in\r\nconsequence, none.  In the course of twenty-five days from the\r\noperation, the more perfect half could not have been distinguished from\r\nany other specimen.  The other had increased much in size; and towards\r\nits posterior end, a clear space was formed in the parenchymatous mass,\r\nin which a rudimentary cup-shaped mouth could clearly be distinguished;\r\non the under surface, however, no corresponding slit was yet open.  If\r\nthe increased heat of the weather, as we approached the equator, had\r\nnot destroyed all the individuals, there can be no doubt that this last\r\nstep would have completed its structure.  Although so well-known an\r\nexperiment, it was interesting to watch the gradual production of every\r\nessential organ, out of the simple extremity of another animal.  It is\r\nextremely difficult to preserve these Planariae; as soon as the\r\ncessation of life allows the ordinary laws of change to act, their\r\nentire bodies become soft and fluid, with a rapidity which I have never\r\nseen equalled.\r\n\r\nI first visited the forest in which these Planariae were found, in\r\ncompany with an old Portuguese priest who took me out to hunt with him.\r\nThe sport consisted in turning into the cover a few dogs, and then\r\npatiently waiting to fire at any animal which might appear.  We were\r\naccompanied by the son of a neighbouring farmer--a good specimen of a\r\nwild Brazilian youth.  He was dressed in a tattered old shirt and\r\ntrousers, and had his head uncovered: he carried an old-fashioned gun\r\nand a large knife.  The habit of carrying the knife is universal; and\r\nin traversing a thick wood it is almost necessary, on account of the\r\ncreeping plants. The frequent occurrence of murder may be partly\r\nattributed to this habit.  The Brazilians are so dexterous with the\r\nknife, that they can throw it to some distance with precision, and with\r\nsufficient force to cause a fatal wound.  I have seen a number of\r\nlittle boys practising this art as a game of play and from their skill\r\nin hitting an upright stick, they promised well for more earnest\r\nattempts.  My companion, the day before, had shot two large bearded\r\nmonkeys.  These animals have prehensile tails, the extremity of which,\r\neven after death, can support the whole weight of the body.  One of\r\nthem thus remained fast to a branch, and it was necessary to cut down a\r\nlarge tree to procure it.  This was soon effected, and down came tree\r\nand monkey with an awful crash.  Our day's sport, besides the monkey,\r\nwas confined to sundry small green parrots and a few toucans.  I\r\nprofited, however, by my acquaintance with the Portuguese padre, for on\r\nanother occasion he gave me a fine specimen of the Yagouaroundi cat.\r\n\r\nEvery one has heard of the beauty of the scenery near Botofogo.  The\r\nhouse in which I lived was seated close beneath the well-known mountain\r\nof the Corcovado.  It has been remarked, with much truth, that abruptly\r\nconical hills are characteristic of the formation which Humboldt\r\ndesignates as gneiss-granite.  Nothing can be more striking than the\r\neffect of these huge rounded masses of naked rock rising out of the\r\nmost luxuriant vegetation.\r\n\r\nI was often interested by watching the clouds, which, rolling in from\r\nseaward, formed a bank just beneath the highest point of the Corcovado.\r\nThis mountain, like most others, when thus partly veiled, appeared to\r\nrise to a far prouder elevation than its real height of 2300 feet.  Mr.\r\nDaniell has observed, in his meteorological essays, that a cloud\r\nsometimes appears fixed on a mountain summit, while the wind continues\r\nto blow over it.  The same phenomenon here presented a slightly\r\ndifferent appearance.  In this case the cloud was clearly seen to curl\r\nover, and rapidly pass by the summit, and yet was neither diminished\r\nnor increased in size.  The sun was setting, and a gentle southerly\r\nbreeze, striking against the southern side of the rock, mingled its\r\ncurrent with the colder air above; and the vapour was thus condensed;\r\nbut as the light wreaths of cloud passed over the ridge, and came\r\nwithin the influence of the warmer atmosphere of the northern sloping\r\nbank, they were immediately re-dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe climate, during the months of May and June, or the beginning of\r\nwinter, was delightful.  The mean temperature, from observations taken\r\nat nine o'clock, both morning and evening, was only 72 degs.  It often\r\nrained heavily, but the drying southerly winds soon again rendered the\r\nwalks pleasant.  One morning, in the course of six hours, 1.6 inches of\r\nrain fell.  As this storm passed over the forests which surround the\r\nCorcovado, the sound produced by the drops pattering on the countless\r\nmultitude of leaves was very remarkable, it could be heard at the\r\ndistance of a quarter of a mile, and was like the rushing of a great\r\nbody of water. After the hotter days, it was delicious to sit quietly\r\nin the garden and watch the evening pass into night.  Nature, in these\r\nclimes, chooses her vocalists from more humble performers than in\r\nEurope.  A small frog, of the genus Hyla, sits on a blade of grass\r\nabout an inch above the surface of the water, and sends forth a\r\npleasing chirp: when several are together they sing in harmony on\r\ndifferent notes.  I had some difficulty in catching a specimen of this\r\nfrog.  The genus Hyla has its toes terminated by small suckers; and I\r\nfound this animal could crawl up a pane of glass, when placed\r\nabsolutely perpendicular.  Various cicidae and crickets, at the same\r\ntime, keep up a ceaseless shrill cry, but which, softened by the\r\ndistance, is not unpleasant.  Every evening after dark this great\r\nconcert commenced; and often have I sat listening to it, until my\r\nattention has been drawn away by some curious passing insect.\r\n\r\nAt these times the fireflies are seen flitting about from hedge to\r\nhedge.  On a dark night the light can be seen at about two hundred\r\npaces distant.  It is remarkable that in all the different kinds of\r\nglowworms, shining elaters, and various marine animals (such as the\r\ncrustacea, medusae, nereidae, a coralline of the genus Clytia, and\r\nPyrosma), which I have observed, the light has been of a well-marked\r\ngreen colour.  All the fireflies, which I caught here, belonged to the\r\nLampyridae (in which family the English glowworm is included), and the\r\ngreater number of specimens were of Lampyris occidentalis. [4] I found\r\nthat this insect emitted the most brilliant flashes when irritated: in\r\nthe intervals, the abdominal rings were obscured.  The flash was almost\r\nco-instantaneous in the two rings, but it was just perceptible first in\r\nthe anterior one.  The shining matter was fluid and very adhesive:\r\nlittle spots, where the skin had been torn, continued bright with a\r\nslight scintillation, whilst the uninjured parts were obscured.  When\r\nthe insect was decapitated the rings remained uninterruptedly bright,\r\nbut not so brilliant as before: local irritation with a needle always\r\nincreased the vividness of the light.  The rings in one instance\r\nretained their luminous property nearly twenty-four hours after the\r\ndeath of the insect.  From these facts it would appear probable, that\r\nthe animal has only the power of concealing or extinguishing the light\r\nfor short intervals, and that at other times the display is\r\ninvoluntary.  On the muddy and wet gravel-walks I found the larvae of\r\nthis lampyris in great numbers: they resembled in general form the\r\nfemale of the English glowworm.  These larvae possessed but feeble\r\nluminous powers; very differently from their parents, on the slightest\r\ntouch they feigned death and ceased to shine; nor did irritation excite\r\nany fresh display.  I kept several of them alive for some time: their\r\ntails are very singular organs, for they act, by a well-fitted\r\ncontrivance, as suckers or organs of attachment, and likewise as\r\nreservoirs for saliva, or some such fluid.  I repeatedly fed them on\r\nraw meat; and I invariably observed, that every now and then the\r\nextremity of the tail was applied to the mouth, and a drop of fluid\r\nexuded on the meat, which was then in the act of being consumed. The\r\ntail, notwithstanding so much practice, does not seem to be able to\r\nfind its way to the mouth; at least the neck was always touched first,\r\nand apparently as a guide.\r\n\r\nWhen we were at Bahia, an elater or beetle (Pyrophorus luminosus,\r\nIllig.) seemed the most common luminous insect. The light in this case\r\nwas also rendered more brilliant by irritation.  I amused myself one\r\nday by observing the springing powers of this insect, which have not,\r\nas it appears to me, been properly described. [5] The elater, when\r\nplaced on its back and preparing to spring, moved its head and thorax\r\nbackwards, so that the pectoral spine was drawn out, and rested on the\r\nedge of its sheath.  The same backward movement being continued, the\r\nspine, by the full action of the muscles, was bent like a spring; and\r\nthe insect at this moment rested on the extremity of its head and\r\nwing-cases. The effort being suddenly relaxed, the head and thorax flew\r\nup, and in consequence, the base of the wing-cases struck the\r\nsupporting surface with such force, that the insect by the reaction was\r\njerked upwards to the height of one or two inches.  The projecting\r\npoints of the thorax, and the sheath of the spine, served to steady the\r\nwhole body during the spring.  In the descriptions which I have read,\r\nsufficient stress does not appear to have been laid on the elasticity\r\nof the spine: so sudden a spring could not be the result of simple\r\nmuscular contraction, without the aid of some mechanical contrivance.\r\n\r\nOn several occasions I enjoyed some short but most pleasant excursions\r\nin the neighbouring country.  One day I went to the Botanic Garden,\r\nwhere many plants, well known for their great utility, might be seen\r\ngrowing.  The leaves of the camphor, pepper, cinnamon, and clove trees\r\nwere delightfully aromatic; and the bread-fruit, the jaca, and the\r\nmango, vied with each other in the magnificence of their foliage. The\r\nlandscape in the neighbourhood of Bahia almost takes its character from\r\nthe two latter trees.  Before seeing them, I had no idea that any trees\r\ncould cast so black a shade on the ground.  Both of them bear to the\r\nevergreen vegetation of these climates the same kind of relation which\r\nlaurels and hollies in England do to the lighter green of the deciduous\r\ntrees.  It may be observed, that the houses within the tropics are\r\nsurrounded by the most beautiful forms of vegetation, because many of\r\nthem are at the same time most useful to man.  Who can doubt that these\r\nqualities are united in the banana, the cocoa-nut, the many kinds of\r\npalm, the orange, and the bread-fruit tree?\r\n\r\nDuring this day I was particularly struck with a remark of Humboldt's,\r\nwho often alludes to \"the thin vapour which, without changing the\r\ntransparency of the air, renders its tints more harmonious, and softens\r\nits effects.\" This is an appearance which I have never observed in the\r\ntemperate zones.  The atmosphere, seen through a short space of half or\r\nthree-quarters of a mile, was perfectly lucid, but at a greater\r\ndistance all colours were blended into a most beautiful haze, of a pale\r\nFrench grey, mingled with a little blue. The condition of the\r\natmosphere between the morning and about noon, when the effect was most\r\nevident, had undergone little change, excepting in its dryness.  In the\r\ninterval, the difference between the dew point and temperature had\r\nincreased from 7.5 to 17 degs.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I started early and walked to the Gavia, or topsail\r\nmountain.  The air was delightfully cool and fragrant; and the drops of\r\ndew still glittered on the leaves of the large liliaceous plants, which\r\nshaded the streamlets of clear water.  Sitting down on a block of\r\ngranite, it was delightful to watch the various insects and birds as\r\nthey flew past.  The humming-bird seems particularly fond of such shady\r\nretired spots.  Whenever I saw these little creatures buzzing round a\r\nflower, with their wings vibrating so rapidly as to be scarcely\r\nvisible, I was reminded of the sphinx moths: their movements and habits\r\nare indeed in many respects very similar.\r\n\r\nFollowing a pathway, I entered a noble forest, and from a height of\r\nfive or six hundred feet, one of those splendid views was presented,\r\nwhich are so common on every side of Rio.  At this elevation the\r\nlandscape attains its most brilliant tint; and every form, every shade,\r\nso completely surpasses in magnificence all that the European has ever\r\nbeheld in his own country, that he knows not how to express his\r\nfeelings.  The general effect frequently recalled to my mind the gayest\r\nscenery of the Opera-house or the great theatres.  I never returned\r\nfrom these excursions empty-handed.  This day I found a specimen of a\r\ncurious fungus, called Hymenophallus.  Most people know the English\r\nPhallus, which in autumn taints the air with its odious smell: this,\r\nhowever, as the entomologist is aware, is, to some of our beetles a\r\ndelightful fragrance.  So was it here; for a Strongylus, attracted by\r\nthe odour, alighted on the fungus as I carried it in my hand.  We here\r\nsee in two distant countries a similar relation between plants and\r\ninsects of the same families, though the species of both are different.\r\nWhen man is the agent in introducing into a country a new species, this\r\nrelation is often broken: as one instance of this I may mention, that\r\nthe leaves of the cabbages and lettuces, which in England afford food\r\nto such a multitude of slugs and caterpillars, in the gardens near Rio\r\nare untouched.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Brazil I made a large collection of insects.  A few\r\ngeneral observations on the comparative importance of the different\r\norders may be interesting to the English entomologist.  The large and\r\nbrilliantly coloured Lepidoptera bespeak the zone they inhabit, far\r\nmore plainly than any other race of animals.  I allude only to the\r\nbutterflies; for the moths, contrary to what might have been expected\r\nfrom the rankness of the vegetation, certainly appeared in much fewer\r\nnumbers than in our own temperate regions.  I was much surprised at the\r\nhabits of Papilio feronia.  This butterfly is not uncommon, and\r\ngenerally frequents the orange-groves.  Although a high flier, yet it\r\nvery frequently alights on the trunks of trees.  On these occasions its\r\nhead is invariably placed downwards; and its wings are expanded in a\r\nhorizontal plane, instead of being folded vertically, as is commonly\r\nthe case.  This is the only butterfly which I have ever seen, that uses\r\nits legs for running. Not being aware of this fact, the insect, more\r\nthan once, as I cautiously approached with my forceps, shuffled on one\r\nside just as the instrument was on the point of closing, and thus\r\nescaped.  But a far more singular fact is the power which this species\r\npossesses of making a noise. [6] Several times when a pair, probably\r\nmale and female, were chasing each other in an irregular course, they\r\npassed within a few yards of me; and I distinctly heard a clicking\r\nnoise, similar to that produced by a toothed wheel passing under a\r\nspring catch.  The noise was continued at short intervals, and could be\r\ndistinguished at about twenty yards' distance: I am certain there is no\r\nerror in the observation.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in the general aspect of the Coleoptera. The number\r\nof minute and obscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great. [7] The\r\ncabinets of Europe can, as yet, boast only of the larger species from\r\ntropical climates.  It is sufficient to disturb the composure of an\r\nentomologist's mind, to look forward to the future dimensions of a\r\ncomplete catalogue.  The carnivorous beetles, or Carabidae, appear in\r\nextremely few numbers within the tropics: this is the more remarkable\r\nwhen compared to the case of the carnivorous quadrupeds, which are so\r\nabundant in hot countries.  I was struck with this observation both on\r\nentering Brazil, and when I saw the many elegant and active forms of\r\nthe Harpalidae re-appearing on the temperate plains of La Plata.  Do\r\nthe very numerous spiders and rapacious Hymenoptera supply the place of\r\nthe carnivorous beetles? The carrion-feeders and Brachelytra are very\r\nuncommon; on the other hand, the Rhyncophora and Chrysomelidae, all of\r\nwhich depend on the vegetable world for subsistence, are present in\r\nastonishing numbers.  I do not here refer to the number of different\r\nspecies, but to that of the individual insects; for on this it is that\r\nthe most striking character in the entomology of different countries\r\ndepends.  The orders Orthoptera and Hemiptera are particularly\r\nnumerous; as likewise is the stinging division of the Hymenoptera the\r\nbees, perhaps, being excepted.  A person, on first entering a tropical\r\nforest, is astonished at the labours of the ants: well-beaten paths\r\nbranch off in every direction, on which an army of never-failing\r\nforagers may be seen, some going forth, and others returning, burdened\r\nwith pieces of green leaf, often larger than their own bodies.\r\n\r\nA small dark-coloured ant sometimes migrates in countless numbers.  One\r\nday, at Bahia, my attention was drawn by observing many spiders,\r\ncockroaches, and other insects, and some lizards, rushing in the\r\ngreatest agitation across a bare piece of ground.  A little way behind,\r\nevery stalk and leaf was blackened by a small ant.  The swarm having\r\ncrossed the bare space, divided itself, and descended an old wall.  By\r\nthis means many insects were fairly enclosed; and the efforts which the\r\npoor little creatures made to extricate themselves from such a death\r\nwere wonderful.  When the ants came to the road they changed their\r\ncourse, and in narrow files reascended the wall.  Having placed a small\r\nstone so as to intercept one of the lines, the whole body attacked it,\r\nand then immediately retired.  Shortly afterwards another body came to\r\nthe charge, and again having failed to make any impression, this line\r\nof march was entirely given up.  By going an inch round, the file might\r\nhave avoided the stone, and this doubtless would have happened, if it\r\nhad been originally there: but having been attacked, the lion-hearted\r\nlittle warriors scorned the idea of yielding.\r\n\r\nCertain wasp-like insects, which construct in the corners of the\r\nverandahs clay cells for their larvae, are very numerous in the\r\nneighbourhood of Rio.  These cells they stuff full of half-dead spiders\r\nand caterpillars, which they seem wonderfully to know how to sting to\r\nthat degree as to leave them paralysed but alive, until their eggs are\r\nhatched; and the larvae feed on the horrid mass of powerless,\r\nhalf-killed victims--a sight which has been described by an\r\nenthusiastic naturalist [8] as curious and pleasing!  I was much\r\ninterested one day by watching a deadly contest between a Pepsis and a\r\nlarge spider of the genus Lycosa.  The wasp made a sudden dash at its\r\nprey, and then flew away: the spider was evidently wounded, for, trying\r\nto escape, it rolled down a little slope, but had still strength\r\nsufficient to crawl into a thick tuft of grass.  The wasp soon\r\nreturned, and seemed surprised at not immediately finding its victim.\r\nIt then commenced as regular a hunt as ever hound did after fox; making\r\nshort semicircular casts, and all the time rapidly vibrating its wings\r\nand antennae.  The spider, though well concealed, was soon discovered,\r\nand the wasp, evidently still afraid of its adversary's jaws, after\r\nmuch manoeuvring, inflicted two stings on the under side of its thorax.\r\nAt last, carefully examining with its antennae the now motionless\r\nspider, it proceeded to drag away the body.  But I stopped both tyrant\r\nand prey. [9]\r\n\r\nThe number of spiders, in proportion to other insects, is here compared\r\nwith England very much larger; perhaps more so than with any other\r\ndivision of the articulate animals. The variety of species among the\r\njumping spiders appears almost infinite.  The genus, or rather family,\r\nof Epeira, is here characterized by many singular forms; some species\r\nhave pointed coriaceous shells, others enlarged and spiny tibiae. Every\r\npath in the forest is barricaded with the strong yellow web of a\r\nspecies, belonging to the same division with the Epeira clavipes of\r\nFabricius, which was formerly said by Sloane to make, in the West\r\nIndies, webs so strong as to catch birds.  A small and pretty kind of\r\nspider, with very long fore-legs, and which appears to belong to an\r\nundescribed genus, lives as a parasite on almost every one of these\r\nwebs.  I suppose it is too insignificant to be noticed by the great\r\nEpeira, and is therefore allowed to prey on the minute insects, which,\r\nadhering to the lines, would otherwise be wasted.  When frightened,\r\nthis little spider either feigns death by extending its front legs, or\r\nsuddenly drops from the web.  A large Epeira of the same division with\r\nEpeira tuberculata and conica is extremely common, especially in dry\r\nsituations.  Its web, which is generally placed among the great leaves\r\nof the common agave, is sometimes strengthened near the centre by a\r\npair or even four zigzag ribbons, which connect two adjoining rays.\r\nWhen any large insect, as a grasshopper or wasp, is caught, the spider,\r\nby a dexterous movement, makes it revolve very rapidly, and at the same\r\ntime emitting a band of threads from its spinners, soon envelops its\r\nprey in a case like the cocoon of a silkworm. The spider now examines\r\nthe powerless victim, and gives the fatal bite on the hinder part of\r\nits thorax; then retreating, patiently waits till the poison has taken\r\neffect. The virulence of this poison may be judged of from the fact\r\nthat in half a minute I opened the mesh, and found a large wasp quite\r\nlifeless.  This Epeira always stands with its head downwards near the\r\ncentre of the web.  When disturbed, it acts differently according to\r\ncircumstances: if there is a thicket below, it suddenly falls down; and\r\nI have distinctly seen the thread from the spinners lengthened by the\r\nanimal while yet stationary, as preparatory to its fall.  If the ground\r\nis clear beneath, the Epeira seldom falls, but moves quickly through a\r\ncentral passage from one to the other side.  When still further\r\ndisturbed, it practises a most curious manoeuvre: standing in the\r\nmiddle, it violently jerks the web, which it attached to elastic twigs,\r\ntill at last the whole acquires such a rapid vibratory movement, that\r\neven the outline of the spider's body becomes indistinct.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that most of the British spiders, when a large insect\r\nis caught in their webs, endeavour to cut the lines and liberate their\r\nprey, to save their nets from being entirely spoiled.  I once, however,\r\nsaw in a hothouse in Shropshire a large female wasp caught in the\r\nirregular web of a quite small spider; and this spider, instead of\r\ncutting the web, most perseveringly continued to entangle the body, and\r\nespecially the wings, of its prey.  The wasp at first aimed in vain\r\nrepeated thrusts with its sting at its little antagonist. Pitying the\r\nwasp, after allowing it to struggle for more than an hour, I killed it\r\nand put it back into the web.  The spider soon returned; and an hour\r\nafterwards I was much surprised to find it with its jaws buried in the\r\norifice, through which the sting is protruded by the living wasp.  I\r\ndrove the spider away two or three times, but for the next twenty-four\r\nhours I always found it again sucking at the same place.  The spider\r\nbecame much distended by the juices of its prey, which was many times\r\nlarger than itself.\r\n\r\nI may here just mention, that I found, near St. Fe Bajada, many large\r\nblack spiders, with ruby-coloured marks on their backs, having\r\ngregarious habits.  The webs were placed vertically, as is invariably\r\nthe case with the genus Epeira: they were separated from each other by\r\na space of about two feet, but were all attached to certain common\r\nlines, which were of great length, and extended to all parts of the\r\ncommunity.  In this manner the tops of some large bushes were\r\nencompassed by the united nets.  Azara [10] has described a gregarious\r\nspider in Paraguay, which Walckanaer thinks must be a Theridion, but\r\nprobably it is an Epeira, and perhaps even the same species with mine.\r\nI cannot, however, recollect seeing a central nest as large as a hat,\r\nin which, during autumn, when the spiders die, Azara says the eggs are\r\ndeposited.  As all the spiders which I saw were of the same size, they\r\nmust have been nearly of the same age.  This gregarious habit, in so\r\ntypical a genus as Epeira, among insects, which are so bloodthirsty and\r\nsolitary that even the two sexes attack each other, is a very singular\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIn a lofty valley of the Cordillera, near Mendoza, I found another\r\nspider with a singularly-formed web.  Strong lines radiated in a\r\nvertical plane from a common centre, where the insect had its station;\r\nbut only two of the rays were connected by a symmetrical mesh-work; so\r\nthat the net, instead of being, as is generally the case, circular,\r\nconsisted of a wedge-shaped segment.  All the webs were similarly\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n[1] Venda, the Portuguese name for an inn.\r\n\r\n[2] Annales des Sciences Naturelles for 1833.\r\n\r\n[3] I have described and named these species in the Annals of Nat.\r\nHist., vol. xiv. p. 241.\r\n\r\n[4] I am greatly indebted to Mr. Waterhouse for his kindness in naming\r\nfor me this and many other insects, and giving me much valuable\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\n[5] Kirby's Entomology, vol. ii. p. 317.\r\n\r\n[6] Mr. Doubleday has lately described (before the Entomological\r\nSociety, March 3rd, 1845) a peculiar structure in the wings of this\r\nbutterfly, which seems to be the means of its making its noise.  He\r\nsays, \"It is remarkable for having a sort of drum at the base of the\r\nfore wings, between the costal nervure and the subcostal.  These two\r\nnervures, moreover, have a peculiar screw-like diaphragm or vessel in\r\nthe interior.\" I find in Langsdorff's travels (in the years 1803-7, p.\r\n74) it is said, that in the island of St. Catherine's on the coast of\r\nBrazil, a butterfly called Februa Hoffmanseggi, makes a noise, when\r\nflying away, like a rattle.\r\n\r\n[7] I may mention, as a common instance of one day's (June 23rd)\r\ncollecting, when I was not attending particularly to the Coleoptera,\r\nthat I caught sixty-eight species of that order. Among these, there\r\nwere only two of the Carabidae, four Brachelytra, fifteen Rhyncophora,\r\nand fourteen of the Chrysomelidae.  Thirty-seven species of Arachnidae,\r\nwhich I brought home, will be sufficient to prove that I was not paying\r\novermuch attention to the generally favoured order of Coleoptera.\r\n\r\n[8] In a MS. in the British Museum by Mr. Abbott, who made his\r\nobservations in Georgia; see Mr. A.

In our passage to the Plata, we\r\nsaw nothing particular, excepting on one day a great shoal of\r\nporpoises, many hundreds in number.  The whole sea was in places\r\nfurrowed by them; and a most extraordinary spectacle was presented, as\r\nhundreds, proceeding together by jumps, in which their whole bodies\r\nwere exposed, thus cut the water.  When the ship was running nine knots\r\nan hour, these animals could cross and recross the bows with the\r\ngreatest of ease, and then dash away right ahead.  As soon as we\r\nentered the estuary of the Plata, the weather was very unsettled.  One\r\ndark night we were surrounded by numerous seals and penguins, which\r\nmade such strange noises, that the officer on watch reported he could\r\nhear the cattle bellowing on shore.  On a second night we witnessed a\r\nsplendid scene of natural fireworks; the mast-head and yard-arm-ends\r\nshone with St. Elmo's light; and the form of the vane could almost be\r\ntraced, as if it had been rubbed with phosphorus.  The sea was so\r\nhighly luminous, that the tracks of the penguins were marked by a fiery\r\nwake, and the darkness of the sky was momentarily illuminated by the\r\nmost vivid lightning.\r\n\r\nWhen within the mouth of the river, I was interested by observing how\r\nslowly the waters of the sea and river mixed. The latter, muddy and\r\ndiscoloured, from its less specific gravity, floated on the surface of\r\nthe salt water.  This was curiously exhibited in the wake of the\r\nvessel, where a line of blue water was seen mingling in little eddies,\r\nwith the adjoining fluid.\r\n\r\nJuly 26th.--We anchored at Monte Video.  The Beagle was employed in\r\nsurveying the extreme southern and eastern coasts of America, south of\r\nthe Plata, during the two succeeding years.  To prevent useless\r\nrepetitions, I will extract those parts of my journal which refer to\r\nthe same districts without always attending to the order in which we\r\nvisited them.\r\n\r\nMALDONADO is situated on the northern bank of the Plata, and not very\r\nfar from the mouth of the estuary.  It is a most quiet, forlorn, little\r\ntown; built, as is universally the case in these countries, with the\r\nstreets running at right angles to each other, and having in the middle\r\na large plaza or square, which, from its size, renders the scantiness\r\nof the population more evident.  It possesses scarcely any trade; the\r\nexports being confined to a few hides and living cattle. The\r\ninhabitants are chiefly landowners, together with a few shopkeepers and\r\nthe necessary tradesmen, such as blacksmiths and carpenters, who do\r\nnearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round.  The town\r\nis separated from the river by a band of sand-hillocks, about a mile\r\nbroad: it is surrounded, on all other sides, by an open\r\nslightly-undulating country, covered by one uniform layer of fine green\r\nturf, on which countless herds of cattle, sheep, and horses graze.\r\nThere is very little land cultivated even close to the town. A few\r\nhedges, made of cacti and agave, mark out where some wheat or Indian\r\ncorn has been planted.  The features of the country are very similar\r\nalong the whole northern bank of the Plata.  The only difference is,\r\nthat here the granitic hills are a little bolder.  The scenery is very\r\nuninteresting; there is scarcely a house, an enclosed piece of ground,\r\nor even a tree, to give it an air of cheerfulness Yet, after being\r\nimprisoned for some time in a ship, there is a charm in the unconfined\r\nfeeling of walking over boundless plains of turf.  Moreover, if your\r\nview is limited to a small space, many objects possess beauty.  Some of\r\nthe smaller birds are brilliantly coloured; and the bright green sward,\r\nbrowsed short by the cattle, is ornamented by dwarf flowers, among\r\nwhich a plant, looking like the daisy, claimed the place of an old\r\nfriend.  What would a florist say to whole tracts, so thickly covered\r\nby the Verbena melindres, as, even at a distance, to appear of the most\r\ngaudy scarlet?\r\n\r\nI stayed ten weeks at Maldonado, in which time a nearly perfect\r\ncollection of the animals, birds, and reptiles, was procured.  Before\r\nmaking any observations respecting them, I will give an account of a\r\nlittle excursion I made as far as the river Polanco, which is about\r\nseventy miles distant, in a northerly direction.  I may mention, as a\r\nproof how cheap everything is in this country, that I paid only two\r\ndollars a day, or eight shillings, for two men, together with a troop\r\nof about a dozen riding-horses.  My companions were well armed with\r\npistols and sabres; a precaution which I thought rather unnecessary but\r\nthe first piece of news we heard was, that, the day before, a traveller\r\nfrom Monte Video had been found dead on the road, with his throat cut.\r\nThis happened close to a cross, the record of a former murder.\r\n\r\nOn the first night we slept at a retired little country-house; and\r\nthere I soon found out that I possessed two or three articles,\r\nespecially a pocket compass, which created unbounded astonishment.  In\r\nevery house I was asked to show the compass, and by its aid, together\r\nwith a map, to point out the direction of various places.  It excited\r\nthe liveliest admiration that I, a perfect stranger, should know the\r\nroad (for direction and road are synonymous in this open country) to\r\nplaces where I had never been.  At one house a young woman, who was ill\r\nin bed, sent to entreat me to come and show her the compass.  If their\r\nsurprise was great, mine was greater, to find such ignorance among\r\npeople who possessed their thousands of cattle, and \"estancias\" of\r\ngreat extent.  It can only be accounted for by the circumstance that\r\nthis retired part of the country is seldom visited by foreigners.  I\r\nwas asked whether the earth or sun moved; whether it was hotter or\r\ncolder to the north; where Spain was, and many other such questions.\r\nThe greater number of the inhabitants had an indistinct idea that\r\nEngland, London, and North America, were different names for the same\r\nplace; but the better informed well knew that London and North America\r\nwere separate countries close together, and that England was a large\r\ntown in London!  I carried with me some promethean matches, which I\r\nignited by biting; it was thought so wonderful that a man should strike\r\nfire with his teeth, that it was usual to collect the whole family to\r\nsee it: I was once offered a dollar for a single one.  Washing my face\r\nin the morning caused much speculation at the village of Las Minas; a\r\nsuperior tradesman closely cross-questioned me about so singular a\r\npractice; and likewise why on board we wore our beards; for he had\r\nheard from my guide that we did so.  He eyed me with much suspicion;\r\nperhaps he had heard of ablutions in the Mahomedan religion, and\r\nknowing me to be a heretick, probably he came to the conclusion that\r\nall hereticks were Turks.  It is the general custom in this country to\r\nask for a night's lodging at the first convenient house.  The\r\nastonishment at the compass, and my other feats of jugglery, was to a\r\ncertain degree advantageous, as with that, and the long stories my\r\nguides told of my breaking stones, knowing venomous from harmless\r\nsnakes, collecting insects, etc., I repaid them for their hospitality.\r\nI am writing as if I had been among the inhabitants of central Africa:\r\nBanda Oriental would not be flattered by the comparison; but such were\r\nmy feelings at the time.\r\n\r\nThe next day we rode to the village of Las Minas.  The country was\r\nrather more hilly, but otherwise continued the same; an inhabitant of\r\nthe Pampas no doubt would have considered it as truly Alpine.  The\r\ncountry is so thinly inhabited, that during the whole day we scarcely\r\nmet a single person.  Las Minas is much smaller even than Maldonado. It\r\nis seated on a little plain, and is surrounded by low rocky mountains.\r\nIt is of the usual symmetrical form, and with its whitewashed church\r\nstanding in the centre, had rather a pretty appearance.  The\r\noutskirting houses rose out of the plain like isolated beings, without\r\nthe accompaniment of gardens or courtyards.  This is generally the case\r\nin the country, and all the houses have, in consequence an\r\nuncomfortable aspect.  At night we stopped at a pulperia, or\r\ndrinking-shop.  During the evening a great number of Gauchos came in to\r\ndrink spirits and smoke cigars: their appearance is very striking; they\r\nare generally tall and handsome, but with a proud and dissolute\r\nexpression of countenance.  They frequently wear their moustaches and\r\nlong black hair curling down their backs.  With their brightly coloured\r\ngarments, great spurs clanking about their heels, and knives stuck as\r\ndaggers (and often so used) at their waists, they look a very different\r\nrace of men from what might be expected from their name of Gauchos, or\r\nsimple countrymen. Their politeness is excessive; they never drink\r\ntheir spirits without expecting you to taste it; but whilst making\r\ntheir exceedingly graceful bow, they seem quite as ready, if occasion\r\noffered, to cut your throat.\r\n\r\nOn the third day we pursued rather an irregular course, as I was\r\nemployed in examining some beds of marble.  On the fine plains of turf\r\nwe saw many ostriches (Struthio rhea).  Some of the flocks contained as\r\nmany as twenty or thirty birds.  These, when standing on any little\r\neminence, and seen against the clear sky, presented a very noble\r\nappearance.  I never met with such tame ostriches in any other part of\r\nthe country: it was easy to gallop up within a short distance of them;\r\nbut then, expanding their wings, they made all sail right before the\r\nwind, and soon left the horse astern.\r\n\r\nAt night we came to the house of Don Juan Fuentes, a rich landed\r\nproprietor, but not personally known to either of my companions.  On\r\napproaching the house of a stranger, it is usual to follow several\r\nlittle points of etiquette: riding up slowly to the door, the\r\nsalutation of Ave Maria is given, and until somebody comes out and asks\r\nyou to alight, it is not customary even to get off your horse: the\r\nformal answer of the owner is, \"sin pecado concebida\"--that is,\r\nconceived without sin.  Having entered the house, some general\r\nconversation is kept up for a few minutes, till permission is asked to\r\npass the night there.  This is granted as a matter of course.  The\r\nstranger then takes his meals with the family, and a room is assigned\r\nhim, where with the horsecloths belonging to his recado (or saddle of\r\nthe Pampas) he makes his bed.  It is curious how similar circumstances\r\nproduce such similar results in manners.  At the Cape of Good Hope the\r\nsame hospitality, and very nearly the same points of etiquette, are\r\nuniversally observed.  The difference, however, between the character\r\nof the Spaniard and that of the Dutch boer is shown, by the former\r\nnever asking his guest a single question beyond the strictest rule of\r\npoliteness, whilst the honest Dutchman demands where he has been, where\r\nhe is going, what is his business, and even how many brothers sisters,\r\nor children he may happen to have.\r\n\r\nShortly after our arrival at Don Juan's, one of the largest herds of\r\ncattle was driven in towards the house, and three beasts were picked\r\nout to be slaughtered for the supply of the establishment.  These\r\nhalf-wild cattle are very active; and knowing full well the fatal lazo,\r\nthey led the horses a long and laborious chase.  After witnessing the\r\nrude wealth displayed in the number of cattle, men, and horses, Don\r\nJuan's miserable house was quite curious.  The floor consisted of\r\nhardened mud, and the windows were without glass; the sitting-room\r\nboasted only of a few of the roughest chairs and stools, with a couple\r\nof tables.  The supper, although several strangers were present,\r\nconsisted of two huge piles, one of roast beef, the other of boiled,\r\nwith some pieces of pumpkin: besides this latter there was no other\r\nvegetable, and not even a morsel of bread.  For drinking, a large\r\nearthenware jug of water served the whole party.  Yet this man was the\r\nowner of several square miles of land, of which nearly every acre would\r\nproduce corn, and, with a little trouble, all the common vegetables.\r\nThe evening was spent in smoking, with a little impromptu singing,\r\naccompanied by the guitar.  The signoritas all sat together in one\r\ncorner of the room, and did not sup with the men.\r\n\r\nSo many works have been written about these countries, that it is\r\nalmost superfluous to describe either the lazo or the bolas.  The lazo\r\nconsists of a very strong, but thin, well-plaited rope, made of raw\r\nhide.  One end is attached to the broad surcingle, which fastens\r\ntogether the complicated gear of the recado, or saddle used in the\r\nPampas; the other is terminated by a small ring of iron or brass, by\r\nwhich a noose can be formed.  The Gaucho, when he is going to use the\r\nlazo, keeps a small coil in his bridle-hand, and in the other holds the\r\nrunning noose which is made very large, generally having a diameter of\r\nabout eight feet.  This he whirls round his head, and by the dexterous\r\nmovement of his wrist keeps the noose open; then, throwing it, he\r\ncauses it to fall on any particular spot he chooses.  The lazo, when\r\nnot used, is tied up in a small coil to the after part of the recado.\r\nThe bolas, or balls, are of two kinds: the simplest, which is chiefly\r\nused for catching ostriches, consists of two round stones, covered with\r\nleather, and united by a thin plaited thong, about eight feet long. The\r\nother kind differs only in having three balls united by the thongs to a\r\ncommon centre.  The Gaucho holds the smallest of the three in his hand,\r\nand whirls the other two round and round his head; then, taking aim,\r\nsends them like chain shot revolving through the air.  The balls no\r\nsooner strike any object, than, winding round it, they cross each\r\nother, and become firmly hitched.  The size and weight of the balls\r\nvary, according to the purpose for which they are made: when of stone,\r\nalthough not larger than an apple, they are sent with such force as\r\nsometimes to break the leg even of a horse.  I have seen the balls made\r\nof wood, and as large as a turnip, for the sake of catching these\r\nanimals without injuring them. The balls are sometimes made of iron,\r\nand these can be hurled to the greatest distance.  The main difficulty\r\nin using either lazo or bolas is to ride so well as to be able at full\r\nspeed, and while suddenly turning about, to whirl them so steadily\r\nround the head, as to take aim: on foot any person would soon learn the\r\nart.  One day, as I was amusing myself by galloping and whirling the\r\nballs round my head, by accident the free one struck a bush, and its\r\nrevolving motion being thus destroyed, it immediately fell to the\r\nground, and, like magic, caught one hind leg of my horse; the other\r\nball was then jerked out of my hand, and the horse fairly secured.\r\nLuckily he was an old practised animal, and knew what it meant;\r\notherwise he would probably have kicked till he had thrown himself\r\ndown.  The Gauchos roared with laughter; they cried out that they had\r\nseen every sort of animal caught, but had never before seen a man\r\ncaught by himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the two succeeding days, I reached the furthest point which I\r\nwas anxious to examine.  The country wore the same aspect, till at last\r\nthe fine green turf became more wearisome than a dusty turnpike road.\r\nWe everywhere saw great numbers of partridges (Nothura major).  These\r\nbirds do not go in coveys, nor do they conceal themselves like the\r\nEnglish kind.  It appears a very silly bird.  A man on horseback by\r\nriding round and round in a circle, or rather in a spire, so as to\r\napproach closer each time, may knock on the head as many as he pleases.\r\nThe more common method is to catch them with a running noose, or little\r\nlazo, made of the stem of an ostrich's feather, fastened to the end of\r\na long stick.  A boy on a quiet old horse will frequently thus catch\r\nthirty or forty in a day.  In Arctic North America [1] the Indians\r\ncatch the Varying Hare by walking spirally round and round it, when on\r\nits form: the middle of the day is reckoned the best time, when the sun\r\nis high, and the shadow of the hunter not very long.\r\n\r\nOn our return to Maldonado, we followed rather a different line of\r\nroad.  Near Pan de Azucar, a landmark well known to all those who have\r\nsailed up the Plata, I stayed a day at the house of a most hospitable\r\nold Spaniard.  Early in the morning we ascended the Sierra de las\r\nAnimas.  By the aid of the rising sun the scenery was almost\r\npicturesque. To the westward the view extended over an immense level\r\nplain as far as the Mount, at Monte Video, and to the eastward, over\r\nthe mammillated country of Maldonado.  On the summit of the mountain\r\nthere were several small heaps of stones, which evidently had lain\r\nthere for many years. My companion assured me that they were the work\r\nof the Indians in the old time.  The heaps were similar, but on a much\r\nsmaller scale, to those so commonly found on the mountains of Wales.\r\nThe desire to signalize any event, on the highest point of the\r\nneighbouring land, seems an universal passion with mankind.  At the\r\npresent day, not a single Indian, either civilized or wild, exists in\r\nthis part of the province; nor am I aware that the former inhabitants\r\nhave left behind them any more permanent records than these\r\ninsignificant piles on the summit of the Sierra de las Animas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general, and almost entire absence of trees in Banda Oriental is\r\nremarkable.  Some of the rocky hills are partly covered by thickets,\r\nand on the banks of the larger streams, especially to the north of Las\r\nMinas, willow-trees are not uncommon.  Near the Arroyo Tapes I heard of\r\na wood of palms; and one of these trees, of considerable size, I saw\r\nnear the Pan de Azucar, in lat. 35 degs.  These, and the trees planted\r\nby the Spaniards, offer the only exceptions to the general scarcity of\r\nwood.  Among the introduced kinds may be enumerated poplars, olives,\r\npeach, and other fruit trees: the peaches succeed so well, that they\r\nafford the main supply of firewood to the city of Buenos Ayres.\r\nExtremely level countries, such as the Pampas, seldom appear favourable\r\nto the growth of trees.  This may possibly be attributed either to the\r\nforce of the winds, or the kind of drainage.  In the nature of the\r\nland, however, around Maldonado, no such reason is apparent; the rocky\r\nmountains afford protected situations; enjoying various kinds of soil;\r\nstreamlets of water are common at the bottoms of nearly every valley;\r\nand the clayey nature of the earth seems adapted to retain moisture. It\r\nhas been inferred with much probability, that the presence of woodland\r\nis generally determined [2] by the annual amount of moisture; yet in\r\nthis province abundant and heavy rain falls during the winter; and the\r\nsummer, though dry, is not so in any excessive degree. [3] We see\r\nnearly the whole of Australia covered by lofty trees, yet that country\r\npossesses a far more arid climate.  Hence we must look to some other\r\nand unknown cause.\r\n\r\nConfining our view to South America, we should certainly be tempted to\r\nbelieve that trees flourished only under a very humid climate; for the\r\nlimit of the forest-land follows, in a most remarkable manner, that of\r\nthe damp winds.  In the southern part of the continent, where the\r\nwestern gales, charged with moisture from the Pacific, prevail, every\r\nisland on the broken west coast, from lat. 38 degs. to the extreme\r\npoint of Tierra del Fuego, is densely covered by impenetrable forests.\r\nOn the eastern side of the Cordillera, over the same extent of\r\nlatitude, where a blue sky and a fine climate prove that the atmosphere\r\nhas been deprived of its moisture by passing over the mountains, the\r\narid plains of Patagonia support a most scanty vegetation.  In the more\r\nnorthern parts of the continent, within the limits of the constant\r\nsouth-eastern trade-wind, the eastern side is ornamented by magnificent\r\nforests; whilst the western coast, from lat. 4 degs. S. to lat. 32\r\ndegs. S., may be described as a desert; on this western coast,\r\nnorthward of lat. 4 degs. S., where the trade-wind loses its\r\nregularity, and heavy torrents of rain fall periodically, the shores of\r\nthe Pacific, so utterly desert in Peru, assume near Cape Blanco the\r\ncharacter of luxuriance so celebrated at Guyaquil and Panama.  Hence in\r\nthe southern and northern parts of the continent, the forest and desert\r\nlands occupy reversed positions with respect to the Cordillera, and\r\nthese positions are apparently determined by the direction of the\r\nprevalent winds.  In the middle of the continent there is a broad\r\nintermediate band, including central Chile and the provinces of La\r\nPlata, where the rain-bringing winds have not to pass over lofty\r\nmountains, and where the land is neither a desert nor covered by\r\nforests.  But even the rule, if confined to South America, of trees\r\nflourishing only in a climate rendered humid by rain-bearing winds, has\r\na strongly marked exception in the case of the Falkland Islands.  These\r\nislands, situated in the same latitude with Tierra del Fuego and only\r\nbetween two and three hundred miles distant from it, having a nearly\r\nsimilar climate, with a geological formation almost identical, with\r\nfavourable situations and the same kind of peaty soil, yet can boast of\r\nfew plants deserving even the title of bushes; whilst in Tierra del\r\nFuego it is impossible to find an acre of land not covered by the\r\ndensest forest.  In this case, both the direction of the heavy gales of\r\nwind and of the currents of the sea are favourable to the transport of\r\nseeds from Tierra del Fuego, as is shown by the canoes and trunks of\r\ntrees drifted from that country, and frequently thrown on the shores of\r\nthe Western Falkland. Hence perhaps it is, that there are many plants\r\nin common to the two countries but with respect to the trees of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, even attempts made to transplant them have failed.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Maldonado I collected several quadrupeds, eighty\r\nkinds of birds, and many reptiles, including nine species of snakes. Of\r\nthe indigenous mammalia, the only one now left of any size, which is\r\ncommon, is the Cervus campestris.  This deer is exceedingly abundant,\r\noften in small herds, throughout the countries bordering the Plata and\r\nin Northern Patagonia.  If a person crawling close along the ground,\r\nslowly advances towards a herd, the deer frequently, out of curiosity,\r\napproach to reconnoitre him.  I have by this means, killed from one\r\nspot, three out of the same herd.  Although so tame and inquisitive,\r\nyet when approached on horseback, they are exceedingly wary.  In this\r\ncountry nobody goes on foot, and the deer knows man as its enemy only\r\nwhen he is mounted and armed with the bolas. At Bahia Blanca, a recent\r\nestablishment in Northern Patagonia, I was surprised to find how little\r\nthe deer cared for the noise of a gun: one day I fired ten times from\r\nwithin eighty yards at one animal; and it was much more startled at the\r\nball cutting up the ground than at the report of the rifle.  My powder\r\nbeing exhausted, I was obliged to get up (to my shame as a sportsman be\r\nit spoken, though well able to kill birds on the wing) and halloo till\r\nthe deer ran away.\r\n\r\nThe most curious fact with respect to this animal, is the\r\noverpoweringly strong and offensive odour which proceeds from the buck.\r\nIt is quite indescribable: several times whilst skinning the specimen\r\nwhich is now mounted at the Zoological Museum, I was almost overcome by\r\nnausea.  I tied up the skin in a silk pocket-handkerchief, and so\r\ncarried it home: this handkerchief, after being well washed, I\r\ncontinually used, and it was of course as repeatedly washed; yet every\r\ntime, for a space of one year and seven months, when first unfolded, I\r\ndistinctly perceived the odour.  This appears an astonishing instance\r\nof the permanence of some matter, which nevertheless in its nature must\r\nbe most subtile and volatile.  Frequently, when passing at the distance\r\nof half a mile to leeward of a herd, I have perceived the whole air\r\ntainted with the effluvium.  I believe the smell from the buck is most\r\npowerful at the period when its horns are perfect, or free from the\r\nhairy skin.  When in this state the meat is, of course, quite\r\nuneatable; but the Gauchos assert, that if buried for some time in\r\nfresh earth, the taint is removed.  I have somewhere read that the\r\nislanders in the north of Scotland treat the rank carcasses of the\r\nfish-eating birds in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThe order Rodentia is here very numerous in species: of mice alone I\r\nobtained no less than eight kinds. [4] The largest gnawing animal in\r\nthe world, the Hydrochaerus capybara (the water-hog), is here also\r\ncommon.  One which I shot at Monte Video weighed ninety-eight pounds:\r\nits length from the end of the snout to the stump-like tail, was three\r\nfeet two inches; and its girth three feet eight.  These great Rodents\r\noccasionally frequent the islands in the mouth of the Plata, where the\r\nwater is quite salt, but are far more abundant on the borders of\r\nfresh-water lakes and rivers. Near Maldonado three or four generally\r\nlive together.  In the daytime they either lie among the aquatic\r\nplants, or openly feed on the turf plain. [5] When viewed at a\r\ndistance, from their manner of walking and colour they resemble pigs:\r\nbut when seated on their haunches, and attentively watching any object\r\nwith one eye, they reassume the appearance of their congeners, cavies\r\nand rabbits.  Both the front and side view of their head has quite a\r\nludicrous aspect, from the great depth of their jaw.  These animals, at\r\nMaldonado, were very tame; by cautiously walking, I approached within\r\nthree yards of four old ones.  This tameness may probably be accounted\r\nfor, by the Jaguar having been banished for some years, and by the\r\nGaucho not thinking it worth his while to hunt them.  As I approached\r\nnearer and nearer they frequently made their peculiar noise, which is a\r\nlow abrupt grunt, not having much actual sound, but rather arising from\r\nthe sudden expulsion of air: the only noise I know at all like it, is\r\nthe first hoarse bark of a large dog.  Having watched the four from\r\nalmost within arm's length (and they me) for several minutes, they\r\nrushed into the water at full gallop with the greatest impetuosity, and\r\nemitted at the same time their bark.  After diving a short distance\r\nthey came again to the surface, but only just showed the upper part of\r\ntheir heads.  When the female is swimming in the water, and has young\r\nones, they are said to sit on her back. These animals are easily killed\r\nin numbers; but their skins are of trifling value, and the meat is very\r\nindifferent.  On the islands in the Rio Parana they are exceedingly\r\nabundant, and afford the ordinary prey to the Jaguar.\r\n\r\nThe Tucutuco (Ctenomys Brasiliensis) is a curious small animal, which\r\nmay be briefly described as a Gnawer, with the habits of a mole.  It is\r\nextremely numerous in some parts of the country, but it is difficult to\r\nbe procured, and never, I believe, comes out of the ground.  It throws\r\nup at the mouth of its burrows hillocks of earth like those of the\r\nmole, but smaller.  Considerable tracts of country are so completely\r\nundermined by these animals, that horses in passing over, sink above\r\ntheir fetlocks.  The tucutucos appear, to a certain degree, to be\r\ngregarious: the man who procured the specimens for me had caught six\r\ntogether, and he said this was a common occurrence.  They are nocturnal\r\nin their habits; and their principal food is the roots of plants, which\r\nare the object of their extensive and superficial burrows. This animal\r\nis universally known by a very peculiar noise which it makes when\r\nbeneath the ground.  A person, the first time he hears it, is much\r\nsurprised; for it is not easy to tell whence it comes, nor is it\r\npossible to guess what kind of creature utters it.  The noise consists\r\nin a short, but not rough, nasal grunt, which is monotonously repeated\r\nabout four times in quick succession: [6] the name Tucutuco is given in\r\nimitation of the sound.  Where this animal is abundant, it may be heard\r\nat all times of the day, and sometimes directly beneath one's feet.\r\nWhen kept in a room, the tucutucos move both slowly and clumsily, which\r\nappears owing to the outward action of their hind legs; and they are\r\nquite incapable, from the socket of the thigh-bone not having a certain\r\nligament, of jumping even the smallest vertical height.  They are very\r\nstupid in making any attempt to escape; when angry or frightened they\r\nutter the tucutuco. Of those I kept alive several, even the first day,\r\nbecame quite tame, not attempting to bite or to run away; others were a\r\nlittle wilder.\r\n\r\nThe man who caught them asserted that very many are invariably found\r\nblind.  A specimen which I preserved in spirits was in this state; Mr.\r\nReid considers it to be the effect of inflammation in the nictitating\r\nmembrane.  When the animal was alive I placed my finger within half an\r\ninch of its head, and not the slightest notice was taken: it made its\r\nway, however, about the room nearly as well as the others. Considering\r\nthe strictly subterranean habits of the tucutuco, the blindness, though\r\nso common, cannot be a very serious evil; yet it appears strange that\r\nany animal should possess an organ frequently subject to be injured.\r\nLamarck would have been delighted with this fact, had he known it, when\r\nspeculating [7] (probably with more truth than usual with him) on the\r\ngradually _acquired_ blindness of the Asphalax, a Gnawer living under\r\nground, and of the Proteus, a reptile living in dark caverns filled\r\nwith water; in both of which animals the eye is in an almost\r\nrudimentary state, and is covered by a tendinous membrane and skin.  In\r\nthe common mole the eye is extraordinarily small but perfect, though\r\nmany anatomists doubt whether it is connected with the true optic\r\nnerve; its vision must certainly be imperfect, though probably useful\r\nto the animal when it leaves its burrow.  In the tucutuco, which I\r\nbelieve never comes to the surface of the ground, the eye is rather\r\nlarger, but often rendered blind and useless, though without apparently\r\ncausing any inconvenience to the animal; no doubt Lamarck would have\r\nsaid that the tucutuco is now passing into the state of the Asphalax\r\nand Proteus.\r\n\r\nBirds of many kinds are extremely abundant on the undulating, grassy\r\nplains around Maldonado.  There are several species of a family allied\r\nin structure and manners to our Starling: one of these (Molothrus\r\nniger) is remarkable from its habits.  Several may often be seen\r\nstanding together on the back of a cow or horse; and while perched on a\r\nhedge, pluming themselves in the sun, they sometimes attempt to sing,\r\nor rather to hiss; the noise being very peculiar, resembling that of\r\nbubbles of air passing rapidly from a small orifice under water, so as\r\nto produce an acute sound.  According to Azara, this bird, like the\r\ncuckoo, deposits its eggs in other birds' nests.  I was several times\r\ntold by the country people that there certainly is some bird having\r\nthis habit; and my assistant in collecting, who is a very accurate\r\nperson, found a nest of the sparrow of this country (Zonotrichia\r\nmatutina), with one egg in it larger than the others, and of a\r\ndifferent colour and shape.  In North America there is another species\r\nof Molothrus (M. pecoris), which has a similar cuckoo-like habit, and\r\nwhich is most closely allied in every respect to the species from the\r\nPlata, even in such trifling peculiarities as standing on the backs of\r\ncattle; it differs only in being a little smaller, and in its plumage\r\nand eggs being of a slightly different shade of colour.  This close\r\nagreement in structure and habits, in representative species coming\r\nfrom opposite quarters of a great continent, always strikes one as\r\ninteresting, though of common occurrence.\r\n\r\nMr. Swainson has well remarked, [8] that with the exception of the\r\nMolothrus pecoris, to which must be added the M. niger, the cuckoos are\r\nthe only birds which can be called truly parasitical; namely, such as\r\n\"fasten themselves, as it were, on another living animal, whose animal\r\nheat brings their young into life, whose food they live upon, and whose\r\ndeath would cause theirs during the period of infancy.\" It is\r\nremarkable that some of the species, but not all, both of the Cuckoo\r\nand Molothrus, should agree in this one strange habit of their\r\nparasitical propagation, whilst opposed to each other in almost every\r\nother habit: the molothrus, like our starling, is eminently sociable,\r\nand lives on the open plains without art or disguise: the cuckoo, as\r\nevery one knows, is a singularly shy bird; it frequents the most\r\nretired thickets, and feeds on fruit and caterpillars.  In structure\r\nalso these two genera are widely removed from each other. Many\r\ntheories, even phrenological theories, have been advanced to explain\r\nthe origin of the cuckoo laying its eggs in other birds' nests.  M.\r\nPrevost alone, I think, has thrown light by his observations [9] on\r\nthis puzzle: he finds that the female cuckoo, which, according to most\r\nobservers, lays at least from four to six eggs, must pair with the male\r\neach time after laying only one or two eggs.  Now, if the cuckoo was\r\nobliged to sit on her own eggs, she would either have to sit on all\r\ntogether, and therefore leave those first laid so long, that they\r\nprobably would become addled; or she would have to hatch separately\r\neach egg, or two eggs, as soon as laid: but as the cuckoo stays a\r\nshorter time in this country than any other migratory bird, she\r\ncertainly would not have time enough for the successive hatchings.\r\nHence we can perceive in the fact of the cuckoo pairing several times,\r\nand laying her eggs at intervals, the cause of her depositing her eggs\r\nin other birds' nests, and leaving them to the care of foster-parents.\r\nI am strongly inclined to believe that this view is correct, from\r\nhaving been independently led (as we shall hereafter see) to an\r\nanalogous conclusion with regard to the South American ostrich, the\r\nfemales of which are parasitical, if I may so express it, on each\r\nother; each female laying several eggs in the nests of several other\r\nfemales, and the male ostrich undertaking all the cares of incubation,\r\nlike the strange foster-parents with the cuckoo.\r\n\r\nI will mention only two other birds, which are very common, and render\r\nthemselves prominent from their habits. The Saurophagus sulphuratus is\r\ntypical of the great American tribe of tyrant-flycatchers.  In its\r\nstructure it closely approaches the true shrikes, but in its habits may\r\nbe compared to many birds.  I have frequently observed it, hunting a\r\nfield, hovering over one spot like a hawk, and then proceeding on to\r\nanother.  When seen thus suspended in the air, it might very readily at\r\na short distance be mistaken for one of the Rapacious order; its stoop,\r\nhowever, is very inferior in force and rapidity to that of a hawk.  At\r\nother times the Saurophagus haunts the neighbourhood of water, and\r\nthere, like a kingfisher, remaining stationary, it catches any small\r\nfish which may come near the margin.  These birds are not unfrequently\r\nkept either in cages or in courtyards, with their wings cut.  They soon\r\nbecome tame, and are very amusing from their cunning odd manners, which\r\nwere described to me as being similar to those of the common magpie.\r\nTheir flight is undulatory, for the weight of the head and bill appears\r\ntoo great for the body.  In the evening the Saurophagus takes its stand\r\non a bush, often by the roadside, and continually repeats without a\r\nchange a shrill and rather agreeable cry, which somewhat resembles\r\narticulate words: the Spaniards say it is like the words \"Bien te veo\"\r\n(I see you well), and accordingly have given it this name.\r\n\r\nA mocking-bird (Mimus orpheus), called by the inhabitants Calandria, is\r\nremarkable, from possessing a song far superior to that of any other\r\nbird in the country: indeed, it is nearly the only bird in South\r\nAmerica which I have observed to take its stand for the purpose of\r\nsinging.  The song may be compared to that of the Sedge warbler, but is\r\nmore powerful; some harsh notes and some very high ones, being mingled\r\nwith a pleasant warbling.  It is heard only during the spring.  At\r\nother times its cry is harsh and far from harmonious.  Near Maldonado\r\nthese birds were tame and bold; they constantly attended the country\r\nhouses in numbers, to pick the meat which was hung up on the posts or\r\nwalls: if any other small bird joined the feast, the Calandria soon\r\nchased it away.  On the wide uninhabited plains of Patagonia another\r\nclosely allied species, O. Patagonica of d'Orbigny, which frequents the\r\nvalleys clothed with spiny bushes, is a wilder bird, and has a slightly\r\ndifferent tone of voice.  It appears to me a curious circumstance, as\r\nshowing the fine shades of difference in habits, that judging from this\r\nlatter respect alone, when I first saw this second species, I thought\r\nit was different from the Maldonado kind. Having afterwards procured a\r\nspecimen, and comparing the two without particular care, they appeared\r\nso very similar, that I changed my opinion; but now Mr. Gould says that\r\nthey are certainly distinct; a conclusion in conformity with the\r\ntrifling difference of habit, of which, of course, he was not aware.\r\n\r\nThe number, tameness, and disgusting habits of the carrion-feeding\r\nhawks of South America make them pre-eminently striking to any one\r\naccustomed only to the birds of Northern Europe.  In this list may be\r\nincluded four species of the Caracara or Polyborus, the Turkey buzzard,\r\nthe Gallinazo, and the Condor.  The Caracaras are, from their\r\nstructure, placed among the eagles: we shall soon see how ill they\r\nbecome so high a rank.  In their habits they well supply the place of\r\nour carrion-crows, magpies, and ravens; a tribe of birds widely\r\ndistributed over the rest of the world, but entirely absent in South\r\nAmerica.  To begin with the Polyborus Brasiliensis: this is a common\r\nbird, and has a wide geographical range; it is most numerous on the\r\ngrassy savannahs of La Plata (where it goes by the name of Carrancha),\r\nand is far from unfrequent throughout the sterile plains of Patagonia.\r\nIn the desert between the rivers Negro and Colorado, numbers constantly\r\nattend the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted\r\nanimals which chance to perish from fatigue and thirst.  Although thus\r\ncommon in these dry and open countries, and likewise on the arid shores\r\nof the Pacific, it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious\r\nforests of West Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The Carranchas,\r\ntogether with the Chimango, constantly attend in numbers the estancias\r\nand slaughtering-houses.  If an animal dies on the plain the Gallinazo\r\ncommences the feast, and then the two species of Polyborus pick the\r\nbones clean.  These birds, although thus commonly feeding together, are\r\nfar from being friends.  When the Carrancha is quietly seated on the\r\nbranch of a tree or on the ground, the Chimango often continues for a\r\nlong time flying backwards and forwards, up and down, in a semicircle,\r\ntrying each time at the bottom of the curve to strike its larger\r\nrelative.  The Carrancha takes little notice, except by bobbing its\r\nhead. Although the Carranchas frequently assemble in numbers, they are\r\nnot gregarious; for in desert places they may be seen solitary, or more\r\ncommonly by pairs.\r\n\r\nThe Carranchas are said to be very crafty, and to steal great numbers\r\nof eggs.  They attempt, also, together with the Chimango, to pick off\r\nthe scabs from the sore backs of horses and mules.  The poor animal, on\r\nthe one hand, with its ears down and its back arched; and, on the\r\nother, the hovering bird, eyeing at the distance of a yard the\r\ndisgusting morsel, form a picture, which has been described by Captain\r\nHead with his own peculiar spirit and accuracy.  These false eagles\r\nmost rarely kill any living bird or animal; and their vulture-like,\r\nnecrophagous habits are very evident to any one who has fallen asleep\r\non the desolate plains of Patagonia, for when he wakes, he will see, on\r\neach surrounding hillock, one of these birds patiently watching him\r\nwith an evil eye: it is a feature in the landscape of these countries,\r\nwhich will be recognised by every one who has wandered over them.  If a\r\nparty of men go out hunting with dogs and horses, they will be\r\naccompanied, during the day, by several of these attendants.  After\r\nfeeding, the uncovered craw protrudes; at such times, and indeed\r\ngenerally, the Carrancha is an inactive, tame, and cowardly bird.  Its\r\nflight is heavy and slow, like that of an English rook.  It seldom\r\nsoars; but I have twice seen one at a great height gliding through the\r\nair with much ease.  It runs (in contradistinction to hopping), but not\r\nquite so quickly as some of its congeners.  At times the Carrancha is\r\nnoisy, but is not generally so: its cry is loud, very harsh and\r\npeculiar, and may be likened to the sound of the Spanish guttural g,\r\nfollowed by a rough double r r; when uttering this cry it elevates its\r\nhead higher and higher, till at last, with its beak wide open, the\r\ncrown almost touches the lower part of the back.  This fact, which has\r\nbeen doubted, is quite true; I have seen them several times with their\r\nheads backwards in a completely inverted position.  To these\r\nobservations I may add, on the high authority of Azara, that the\r\nCarrancha feeds on worms, shells, slugs, grasshoppers, and frogs; that\r\nit destroys young lambs by tearing the umbilical cord; and that it\r\npursues the Gallinazo, till that bird is compelled to vomit up the\r\ncarrion it may have recently gorged.  Lastly, Azara states that several\r\nCarranchas, five or six together, will unite in chase of large birds,\r\neven such as herons.  All these facts show that it is a bird of very\r\nversatile habits and considerable ingenuity.\r\n\r\nThe Polyborus Chimango is considerably smaller than the last species.\r\nIt is truly omnivorous, and will eat even bread; and I was assured that\r\nit materially injures the potato crops in Chiloe, by stocking up the\r\nroots when first planted.  Of all the carrion-feeders it is generally\r\nthe last which leaves the skeleton of a dead animal, and may often be\r\nseen within the ribs of a cow or horse, like a bird in a cage.  Another\r\nspecies is the Polyborus Novae Zelandiae, which is exceedingly common\r\nin the Falkland Islands.  These birds in many respects resemble in\r\ntheir habits the Carranchas.  They live on the flesh of dead animals\r\nand on marine productions; and on the Ramirez rocks their whole\r\nsustenance must depend on the sea.  They are extraordinarily tame and\r\nfearless, and haunt the neighborhood of houses for offal.  If a hunting\r\nparty kills an animal, a number soon collect and patiently await,\r\nstanding on the ground on all sides.  After eating, their uncovered\r\ncraws are largely protruded, giving them a disgusting appearance.  They\r\nreadily attack wounded birds: a cormorant in this state having taken to\r\nthe shore, was immediately seized on by several, and its death hastened\r\nby their blows.  The Beagle was at the Falklands only during the\r\nsummer, but the officers of the Adventure, who were there in the\r\nwinter, mention many extraordinary instances of the boldness and\r\nrapacity of these birds.  They actually pounced on a dog that was lying\r\nfast asleep close by one of the party; and the sportsmen had difficulty\r\nin preventing the wounded geese from being seized before their eyes. It\r\nis said that several together (in this respect resembling the\r\nCarranchas) wait at the mouth of a rabbit-hole, and together seize on\r\nthe animal when it comes out.  They were constantly flying on board the\r\nvessel when in the harbour; and it was necessary to keep a good look\r\nout to prevent the leather being torn from the rigging, and the meat or\r\ngame from the stern.  These birds are very mischievous and inquisitive;\r\nthey will pick up almost anything from the ground; a large black glazed\r\nhat was carried nearly a mile, as was a pair of the heavy balls used in\r\ncatching cattle.  Mr. Usborne experienced during the survey a more\r\nsevere loss, in their stealing a small Kater's compass in a red morocco\r\nleather case, which was never recovered.  These birds are, moreover,\r\nquarrelsome and very passionate; tearing up the grass with their bills\r\nfrom rage.  They are not truly gregarious; they do not soar, and their\r\nflight is heavy and clumsy; on the ground they run extremely fast, very\r\nmuch like pheasants.  They are noisy, uttering several harsh cries, one\r\nof which is like that of the English rook, hence the sealers always\r\ncall them rooks.  It is a curious circumstance that, when crying out,\r\nthey throw their heads upwards and backwards, after the same manner as\r\nthe Carrancha.  They build in the rocky cliffs of the sea-coast, but\r\nonly on the small adjoining islets, and not on the two main islands:\r\nthis is a singular precaution in so tame and fearless a bird.  The\r\nsealers say that the flesh of these birds, when cooked, is quite white,\r\nand very good eating; but bold must the man be who attempts such a meal.\r\n\r\nWe have now only to mention the turkey-buzzard (Vultur aura), and the\r\nGallinazo.  The former is found wherever the country is moderately\r\ndamp, from Cape Horn to North America.  Differently from the Polyborus\r\nBrasiliensis and Chimango, it has found its way to the Falkland\r\nIslands.  The turkey-buzzard is a solitary bird, or at most goes in\r\npairs.  It may at once be recognised from a long distance, by its\r\nlofty, soaring, and most elegant flight.  It is well known to be a true\r\ncarrion-feeder.  On the west coast of Patagonia, among the\r\nthickly-wooded islets and broken land, it lives exclusively on what the\r\nsea throws up, and on the carcasses of dead seals.  Wherever these\r\nanimals are congregated on the rocks, there the vultures may be seen.\r\nThe Gallinazo (Cathartes atratus) has a different range from the last\r\nspecies, as it never occurs southward of lat. 41 degs.  Azara states\r\nthat there exists a tradition that these birds, at the time of the\r\nconquest, were not found near Monte Video, but that they subsequently\r\nfollowed the inhabitants from more northern districts. At the present\r\nday they are numerous in the valley of the Colorado, which is three\r\nhundred miles due south of Monte Video.  It seems probable that this\r\nadditional migration has happened since the time of Azara.  The\r\nGallinazo generally prefers a humid climate, or rather the\r\nneighbourhood of fresh water; hence it is extremely abundant in Brazil\r\nand La Plata, while it is never found on the desert and arid plains of\r\nNorthern Patagonia, excepting near some stream. These birds frequent\r\nthe whole Pampas to the foot of the Cordillera, but I never saw or\r\nheard of one in Chile; in Peru they are preserved as scavengers.  These\r\nvultures certainly may be called gregarious, for they seem to have\r\npleasure in society, and are not solely brought together by the\r\nattraction of a common prey.  On a fine day a flock may often be\r\nobserved at a great height, each bird wheeling round and round without\r\nclosing its wings, in the most graceful evolutions.  This is clearly\r\nperformed for the mere pleasure of the exercise, or perhaps is\r\nconnected with their matrimonial alliances.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned all the carrion-feeders, excepting the condor, an\r\naccount of which will be more appropriately introduced when we visit a\r\ncountry more congenial to its habits than the plains of La Plata.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a broad band of sand-hillocks which separate the Laguna del Potrero\r\nfrom the shores of the Plata, at the distance of a few miles from\r\nMaldonado, I found a group of those vitrified, siliceous tubes, which\r\nare formed by lightning entering loose sand.  These tubes resemble in\r\nevery particular those from Drigg in Cumberland, described in the\r\nGeological Transactions. [10] The sand-hillocks of Maldonado not being\r\nprotected by vegetation, are constantly changing their position.  From\r\nthis cause the tubes projected above the surface, and numerous\r\nfragments lying near, showed that they had formerly been buried to a\r\ngreater depth.  Four sets entered the sand perpendicularly: by working\r\nwith my hands I traced one of them two feet deep; and some fragments\r\nwhich evidently had belonged to the same tube, when added to the other\r\npart, measured five feet three inches.  The diameter of the whole tube\r\nwas nearly equal, and therefore we must suppose that originally it\r\nextended to a much greater depth.  These dimensions are however small,\r\ncompared to those of the tubes from Drigg, one of which was traced to a\r\ndepth of not less than thirty feet.\r\n\r\nThe internal surface is completely vitrified, glossy, and smooth.  A\r\nsmall fragment examined under the microscope appeared, from the number\r\nof minute entangled air or perhaps steam bubbles, like an assay fused\r\nbefore the blowpipe. The sand is entirely, or in greater part,\r\nsiliceous; but some points are of a black colour, and from their glossy\r\nsurface possess a metallic lustre.  The thickness of the wall of the\r\ntube varies from a thirtieth to a twentieth of an inch, and\r\noccasionally even equals a tenth.  On the outside the grains of sand\r\nare rounded, and have a slightly glazed appearance: I could not\r\ndistinguish any signs of crystallization.  In a similar manner to that\r\ndescribed in the Geological Transactions, the tubes are generally\r\ncompressed, and have deep longitudinal furrows, so as closely to\r\nresemble a shrivelled vegetable stalk, or the bark of the elm or cork\r\ntree.  Their circumference is about two inches, but in some fragments,\r\nwhich are cylindrical and without any furrows, it is as much as four\r\ninches.  The compression from the surrounding loose sand, acting while\r\nthe tube was still softened from the effects of the intense heat, has\r\nevidently caused the creases or furrows.  Judging from the uncompressed\r\nfragments, the measure or bore of the lightning (if such a term may be\r\nused) must have been about one inch and a quarter.  At Paris, M.\r\nHachette and M. Beudant [11] succeeded in making tubes, in most\r\nrespects similar to these fulgurites, by passing very strong shocks of\r\ngalvanism through finely-powdered glass: when salt was added, so as to\r\nincrease its fusibility, the tubes were larger in every dimension. They\r\nfailed both with powdered felspar and quartz.  One tube, formed with\r\npounded glass, was very nearly an inch long, namely .982, and had an\r\ninternal diameter of .019 of an inch.  When we hear that the strongest\r\nbattery in Paris was used, and that its power on a substance of such\r\neasy fusibility as glass was to form tubes so diminutive, we must feel\r\ngreatly astonished at the force of a shock of lightning, which,\r\nstriking the sand in several places, has formed cylinders, in one\r\ninstance of at least thirty feet long, and having an internal bore,\r\nwhere not compressed, of full an inch and a half; and this in a\r\nmaterial so extraordinarily refractory as quartz!\r\n\r\nThe tubes, as I have already remarked, enter the sand nearly in a\r\nvertical direction.  One, however, which was less regular than the\r\nothers, deviated from a right line, at the most considerable bend, to\r\nthe amount of thirty-three degrees. From this same tube, two small\r\nbranches, about a foot apart, were sent off; one pointed downwards, and\r\nthe other upwards.  This latter case is remarkable, as the electric\r\nfluid must have turned back at the acute angle of 26 degs., to the line\r\nof its main course.  Besides the four tubes which I found vertical, and\r\ntraced beneath the surface, there were several other groups of\r\nfragments, the original sites of which without doubt were near.  All\r\noccurred in a level area of shifting sand, sixty yards by twenty,\r\nsituated among some high sand-hillocks, and at the distance of about\r\nhalf a mile from a chain of hills four or five hundred feet in height.\r\nThe most remarkable circumstance, as it appears to me, in this case as\r\nwell as in that of Drigg, and in one described by M. Ribbentrop in\r\nGermany, is the number of tubes found within such limited spaces.  At\r\nDrigg, within an area of fifteen yards, three were observed, and the\r\nsame number occurred in Germany.  In the case which I have described,\r\ncertainly more than four existed within the space of the sixty by\r\ntwenty yards.  As it does not appear probable that the tubes are\r\nproduced by successive distinct shocks, we must believe that the\r\nlightning, shortly before entering the ground, divides itself into\r\nseparate branches.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of the Rio Plata seems peculiarly subject to electric\r\nphenomena.  In the year 1793, [12] one of the most destructive\r\nthunderstorms perhaps on record happened at Buenos Ayres: thirty-seven\r\nplaces within the city were struck by lightning, and nineteen people\r\nkilled.  From facts stated in several books of travels, I am inclined\r\nto suspect that thunderstorms are very common near the mouths of great\r\nrivers.  Is it not possible that the mixture of large bodies of fresh\r\nand salt water may disturb the electrical equilibrium?  Even during our\r\noccasional visits to this part of South America, we heard of a ship,\r\ntwo churches, and a house having been struck.  Both the church and the\r\nhouse I saw shortly afterwards: the house belonged to Mr. Hood, the\r\nconsul-general at Monte Video.  Some of the effects were curious: the\r\npaper, for nearly a foot on each side of the line where the bell-wires\r\nhad run, was blackened.  The metal had been fused, and although the\r\nroom was about fifteen feet high, the globules, dropping on the chairs\r\nand furniture, had drilled in them a chain of minute holes.  A part of\r\nthe wall was shattered, as if by gunpowder, and the fragments had been\r\nblown off with force sufficient to dent the wall on the opposite side\r\nof the room.  The frame of a looking-glass was blackened, and the\r\ngilding must have been volatilized, for a smelling-bottle, which stood\r\non the chimney-piece, was coated with bright metallic particles, which\r\nadhered as firmly as if they had been enamelled.\r\n\r\n[1] Hearne's Journey, p. 383.\r\n\r\n[2] Maclaren, art. \"America,\" Encyclop.

Those collected by myself have been named and described by\r\nMr. Waterhouse at the meetings of the Zoological Society.  I must be\r\nallowed to take this opportunity of returning my cordial thanks to Mr.\r\nWaterhouse, and to the other gentleman attached to that Society, for\r\ntheir kind and most liberal assistance on all occasions.\r\n\r\n[5] In the stomach and duodenum of a capybara which I opened I found a\r\nvery large quantity of a thin yellowish fluid, in which scarcely a\r\nfibre could be distinguished.  Mr. Owen informs me that a part of the\r\noesophagus is so constructed that nothing much larger than a crowquill\r\ncan be passed down. Certainly the broad teeth and strong jaws of this\r\nanimal are well fitted to grind into pulp the aquatic plants on which\r\nit feeds.\r\n\r\n[6] At the R. Negro, in Northern Patagonia, there is an animal of the\r\nsame habits, and probably a closely allied species, but which I never\r\nsaw.  Its noise is different from that of the Maldonado kind; it is\r\nrepeated only twice instead of three or four times, and is more\r\ndistinct and sonorous; when heard from a distance it so closely\r\nresembles the sound made in cutting down a small tree with an axe, that\r\nI have sometimes remained in doubt concerning it.\r\n\r\n[7] Philosoph.

This is the principal\r\nriver on the whole line of coast between the Strait of Magellan and the\r\nPlata.  It enters the sea about three hundred miles south of the\r\nestuary of the Plata.  About fifty years ago, under the old Spanish\r\ngovernment, a small colony was established here; and it is still the\r\nmost southern position (lat. 41 degs.) on this eastern coast of America\r\ninhabited by civilized man.\r\n\r\nThe country near the mouth of the river is wretched in the extreme: on\r\nthe south side a long line of perpendicular cliffs commences, which\r\nexposes a section of the geological nature of the country.  The strata\r\nare of sandstone, and one layer was remarkable from being composed of a\r\nfirmly-cemented conglomerate of pumice pebbles, which must have\r\ntravelled more than four hundred miles, from the Andes. The surface is\r\neverywhere covered up by a thick bed of gravel, which extends far and\r\nwide over the open plain. Water is extremely scarce, and, where found,\r\nis almost invariably brackish.  The vegetation is scanty; and although\r\nthere are bushes of many kinds, all are armed with formidable thorns,\r\nwhich seem to warn the stranger not to enter on these inhospitable\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThe settlement is situated eighteen miles up the river. The road\r\nfollows the foot of the sloping cliff, which forms the northern\r\nboundary of the great valley, in which the Rio Negro flows.  On the way\r\nwe passed the ruins of some fine \"estancias,\" which a few years since\r\nhad been destroyed by the Indians.  They withstood several attacks.  A\r\nman present at one gave me a very lively description of what took\r\nplace. The inhabitants had sufficient notice to drive all the cattle\r\nand horses into the \"corral\" [1] which surrounded the house, and\r\nlikewise to mount some small cannon.  The Indians were Araucanians from\r\nthe south of Chile; several hundreds in number, and highly disciplined.\r\nThey first appeared in two bodies on a neighbouring hill; having there\r\ndismounted, and taken off their fur mantles, they advanced naked to the\r\ncharge.  The only weapon of an Indian is a very long bamboo or chuzo,\r\nornamented with ostrich feathers, and pointed by a sharp spearhead.  My\r\ninformer seemed to remember with the greatest horror the quivering of\r\nthese chuzos as they approached near.  When close, the cacique\r\nPincheira hailed the besieged to give up their arms, or he would cut\r\nall their throats.  As this would probably have been the result of\r\ntheir entrance under any circumstances, the answer was given by a\r\nvolley of musketry.  The Indians, with great steadiness, came to the\r\nvery fence of the corral: but to their surprise they found the posts\r\nfastened together by iron nails instead of leather thongs, and, of\r\ncourse, in vain attempted to cut them with their knives.  This saved\r\nthe lives of the Christians: many of the wounded Indians were carried\r\naway by their companions, and at last, one of the under caciques being\r\nwounded, the bugle sounded a retreat.  They retired to their horses,\r\nand seemed to hold a council of war.  This was an awful pause for the\r\nSpaniards, as all their ammunition, with the exception of a few\r\ncartridges, was expended.  In an instant the Indians mounted their\r\nhorses, and galloped out of sight.  Another attack was still more\r\nquickly repulsed. A cool Frenchman managed the gun; he stopped till the\r\nIndians approached close, and then raked their line with grape-shot: he\r\nthus laid thirty-nine of them on the ground; and, of course, such a\r\nblow immediately routed the whole party.\r\n\r\nThe town is indifferently called El Carmen or Patagones. It is built on\r\nthe face of a cliff which fronts the river, and many of the houses are\r\nexcavated even in the sandstone. The river is about two or three\r\nhundred yards wide, and is deep and rapid.  The many islands, with\r\ntheir willow-trees, and the flat headlands, seen one behind the other\r\non the northern boundary of the broad green valley, form, by the aid of\r\na bright sun, a view almost picturesque.  The number of inhabitants\r\ndoes not exceed a few hundreds.  These Spanish colonies do not, like\r\nour British ones, carry within themselves the elements of growth.  Many\r\nIndians of pure blood reside here: the tribe of the Cacique Lucanee\r\nconstantly have their Toldos [2] on the outskirts of the town.  The\r\nlocal government partly supplies them with provisions, by giving them\r\nall the old worn-out horses, and they earn a little by making\r\nhorse-rugs and other articles of riding-gear.  These Indians are\r\nconsidered civilized; but what their character may have gained by a\r\nlesser degree of ferocity, is almost counterbalanced by their entire\r\nimmorality.  Some of the younger men are, however, improving; they are\r\nwilling to labour, and a short time since a party went on a\r\nsealing-voyage, and behaved very well.  They were now enjoying the\r\nfruits of their labour, by being dressed in very gay, clean clothes,\r\nand by being very idle.  The taste they showed in their dress was\r\nadmirable; if you could have turned one of these young Indians into a\r\nstatue of bronze, his drapery would have been perfectly graceful.\r\n\r\nOne day I rode to a large salt-lake, or Salina, which is distant\r\nfifteen miles from the town.  During the winter it consists of a\r\nshallow lake of brine, which in summer is converted into a field of\r\nsnow-white salt.  The layer near the margin is from four to five inches\r\nthick, but towards the centre its thickness increases.  This lake was\r\ntwo and a half miles long, and one broad.  Others occur in the\r\nneighbourhood many times larger, and with a floor of salt, two and\r\nthree feet in thickness, even when under water during the winter.  One\r\nof these brilliantly white and level expanses in the midst of the brown\r\nand desolate plain, offers an extraordinary spectacle.  A large\r\nquantity of salt is annually drawn from the salina: and great piles,\r\nsome hundred tons in weight, were lying ready for exportation.  The\r\nseason for working the salinas forms the harvest of Patagones; for on\r\nit the prosperity of the place depends.  Nearly the whole population\r\nencamps on the bank of the river, and the people are employed in\r\ndrawing out the salt in bullock-waggons. This salt is crystallized in\r\ngreat cubes, and is remarkably pure: Mr. Trenham Reeks has kindly\r\nanalyzed some for me, and he finds in it only 0.26 of gypsum and 0.22\r\nof earthy matter.  It is a singular fact, that it does not serve so\r\nwell for preserving meat as sea-salt from the Cape de Verd islands; and\r\na merchant at Buenos Ayres told me that he considered it as fifty per\r\ncent. less valuable.  Hence the Cape de Verd salt is constantly\r\nimported, and is mixed with that from these salinas.  The purity of the\r\nPatagonian salt, or absence from it of those other saline bodies found\r\nin all sea-water, is the only assignable cause for this inferiority: a\r\nconclusion which no one, I think, would have suspected, but which is\r\nsupported by the fact lately ascertained, [3] that those salts answer\r\nbest for preserving cheese which contain most of the deliquescent\r\nchlorides.\r\n\r\nThe border of this lake is formed of mud: and in this numerous large\r\ncrystals of gypsum, some of which are three inches long, lie embedded;\r\nwhilst on the surface others of sulphate of soda lie scattered about.\r\nThe Gauchos call the former the \"Padre del sal,\" and the latter the\r\n\"Madre;\" they state that these progenitive salts always occur on the\r\nborders of the salinas, when the water begins to evaporate. The mud is\r\nblack, and has a fetid odour.  I could not at first imagine the cause\r\nof this, but I afterwards perceived that the froth which the wind\r\ndrifted on shore was coloured green, as if by confervae; I attempted to\r\ncarry home some of this green matter, but from an accident failed.\r\nParts of the lake seen from a short distance appeared of a reddish\r\ncolour, and this perhaps was owing to some infusorial animalcula.  The\r\nmud in many places was thrown up by numbers of some kind of worm, or\r\nannelidous animal.  How surprising it is that any creatures should be\r\nable to exist in brine, and that they should be crawling among crystals\r\nof sulphate of soda and lime!  And what becomes of these worms when,\r\nduring the long summer, the surface is hardened into a solid layer of\r\nsalt?  Flamingoes in considerable numbers inhabit this lake, and breed\r\nhere, throughout Patagonia, in Northern Chile, and at the Galapagos\r\nIslands, I met with these birds wherever there were lakes of brine.  I\r\nsaw them here wading about in search of food--probably for the worms\r\nwhich burrow in the mud; and these latter probably feed on infusoria or\r\nconfervae.  Thus we have a little living world within itself adapted to\r\nthese inland lakes of brine.  A minute crustaceous animal (Cancer\r\nsalinus) is said [4] to live in countless numbers in the brine-pans at\r\nLymington: but only in those in which the fluid has attained, from\r\nevaporation, considerable strength--namely, about a quarter of a pound\r\nof salt to a pint of water.  Well may we affirm that every part of the\r\nworld is habitable!  Whether lakes of brine, or those subterranean ones\r\nhidden beneath volcanic mountains--warm mineral springs--the wide\r\nexpanse and depths of the ocean--the upper regions of the atmosphere,\r\nand even the surface of perpetual snow--all support organic beings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the northward of the Rio Negro, between it and the inhabited country\r\nnear Buenos Ayres, the Spaniards have only one small settlement,\r\nrecently established at Bahia Blanca.  The distance in a straight line\r\nto Buenos Ayres is very nearly five hundred British miles.  The\r\nwandering tribes of horse Indians, which have always occupied the\r\ngreater part of this country, having of late much harassed the outlying\r\nestancias, the government at Buenos Ayres equipped some time since an\r\narmy under the command of General Rosas for the purpose of\r\nexterminating them.  The troops were now encamped on the banks of the\r\nColorado; a river lying about eighty miles northward of the Rio Negro.\r\nWhen General Rosas left Buenos Ayres he struck in a direct line across\r\nthe unexplored plains: and as the country was thus pretty well cleared\r\nof Indians, he left behind him, at wide intervals, a small party of\r\nsoldiers with a troop of horses (a posta), so as to be enabled to keep\r\nup a communication with the capital.  As the Beagle intended to call at\r\nBahia Blanca, I determined to proceed there by land; and ultimately I\r\nextended my plan to travel the whole way by the postas to Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nAugust 11th.--Mr. Harris, an Englishman residing at Patagones, a guide,\r\nand five Gauchos who were proceeding to the army on business, were my\r\ncompanions on the journey. The Colorado, as I have already said, is\r\nnearly eighty miles distant: and as we travelled slowly, we were two\r\ndays and a half on the road.  The whole line of country deserves\r\nscarcely a better name than that of a desert.  Water is found only in\r\ntwo small wells; it is called fresh; but even at this time of the year,\r\nduring the rainy season, it was quite brackish. In the summer this must\r\nbe a distressing passage; for now it was sufficiently desolate.  The\r\nvalley of the Rio Negro, broad as it is, has merely been excavated out\r\nof the sandstone plain; for immediately above the bank on which the\r\ntown stands, a level country commences, which is interrupted only by a\r\nfew trifling valleys and depressions.  Everywhere the landscape wears\r\nthe same sterile aspect; a dry gravelly soil supports tufts of brown\r\nwithered grass, and low scattered bushes, armed with thorns.\r\n\r\nShortly after passing the first spring we came in sight of a famous\r\ntree, which the Indians reverence as the altar of Walleechu.  It is\r\nsituated on a high part of the plain; and hence is a landmark visible\r\nat a great distance.  As soon as a tribe of Indians come in sight of\r\nit, they offer their adorations by loud shouts.  The tree itself is\r\nlow, much branched, and thorny: just above the root it has a diameter\r\nof about three feet.  It stands by itself without any neighbour, and\r\nwas indeed the first tree we saw; afterwards we met with a few others\r\nof the same kind, but they were far from common. Being winter the tree\r\nhad no leaves, but in their place numberless threads, by which the\r\nvarious offerings, such as cigars, bread, meat, pieces of cloth, etc.,\r\nhad been suspended. Poor Indians, not having anything better, only pull\r\na thread out of their ponchos, and fasten it to the tree.  Richer\r\nIndians are accustomed to pour spirits and mate into a certain hole,\r\nand likewise to smoke upwards, thinking thus to afford all possible\r\ngratification to Walleechu.  To complete the scene, the tree was\r\nsurrounded by the bleached bones of horses which had been slaughtered\r\nas sacrifices.  All Indians of every age and sex make their offerings;\r\nthey then think that their horses will not tire, and that they\r\nthemselves shall be prosperous.  The Gaucho who told me this, said that\r\nin the time of peace he had witnessed this scene, and that he and\r\nothers used to wait till the Indians had passed by, for the sake of\r\nstealing from Walleechu the offerings.\r\n\r\nThe Gauchos think that the Indians consider the tree as the god itself,\r\nbut it seems far more probable that they regard it as the altar.  The\r\nonly cause which I can imagine for this choice, is its being a landmark\r\nin a dangerous passage. The Sierra de la Ventana is visible at an\r\nimmense distance; and a Gaucho told me that he was once riding with an\r\nIndian a few miles to the north of the Rio Colorado when the Indian\r\ncommenced making the same loud noise which is usual at the first sight\r\nof the distant tree, putting his hand to his head, and then pointing in\r\nthe direction of the Sierra.  Upon being asked the reason of this, the\r\nIndian said in broken Spanish, \"First see the Sierra.\" About two\r\nleagues beyond this curious tree we halted for the night: at this\r\ninstant an unfortunate cow was spied by the lynx-eyed Gauchos, who set\r\noff in full chase, and in a few minutes dragged her in with their\r\nlazos, and slaughtered her.  We here had the four necessaries of life\r\n\"en el campo,\"--pasture for the horses, water (only a muddy puddle),\r\nmeat and firewood.  The Gauchos were in high spirits at finding all\r\nthese luxuries; and we soon set to work at the poor cow.  This was the\r\nfirst night which I passed under the open sky, with the gear of the\r\nrecado for my bed.  There is high enjoyment in the independence of the\r\nGaucho life--to be able at any moment to pull up your horse, and say,\r\n\"Here we will pass the night.\" The death-like stillness of the plain,\r\nthe dogs keeping watch, the gipsy-group of Gauchos making their beds\r\nround the fire, have left in my mind a strongly-marked picture of this\r\nfirst night, which will never be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe next day the country continued similar to that above described.  It\r\nis inhabited by few birds or animals of any kind.  Occasionally a deer,\r\nor a Guanaco (wild Llama) may be seen; but the Agouti (Cavia\r\nPatagonica) is the commonest quadruped.  This animal here represents\r\nour hares.  It differs, however, from that genus in many essential\r\nrespects; for instance, it has only three toes behind.  It is also\r\nnearly twice the size, weighing from twenty to twenty-five pounds. The\r\nAgouti is a true friend of the desert; it is a common feature of the\r\nlandscape to see two or three hopping quickly one after the other in a\r\nstraight line across these wild plains. They are found as far north as\r\nthe Sierra Tapalguen (lat. 37 degs. 30'), where the plain rather\r\nsuddenly becomes greener and more humid; and their southern limit is\r\nbetween Port Desire and St. Julian, where there is no change in the\r\nnature of the country.  It is a singular fact, that although the Agouti\r\nis not now found as far south as Port St. Julian, yet that Captain\r\nWood, in his voyage in 1670, talks of them as being numerous there.\r\nWhat cause can have altered, in a wide, uninhabited, and rarely-visited\r\ncountry, the range of an animal like this?  It appears also, from the\r\nnumber shot by Captain Wood in one day at Port Desire, that they must\r\nhave been considerably more abundant there formerly than at present.\r\nWhere the Bizcacha lives and makes its burrows, the Agouti uses them;\r\nbut where, as at Bahia Blanca, the Bizcacha is not found, the Agouti\r\nburrows for itself.  The same thing occurs with the little owl of the\r\nPampas (Athene cunicularia), which has so often been described as\r\nstanding like a sentinel at the mouth of the burrows; for in Banda\r\nOriental, owing to the absence of the Bizcacha, it is obliged to hollow\r\nout its own habitation.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as we approached the Rio Colorado, the appearance of\r\nthe country changed; we soon came on a plain covered with turf, which,\r\nfrom its flowers, tall clover, and little owls, resembled the Pampas.\r\nWe passed also a muddy swamp of considerable extent, which in summer\r\ndries, and becomes incrusted with various salts; and hence is called a\r\nsalitral.  It was covered by low succulent plants, of the same kind\r\nwith those growing on the sea-shore.  The Colorado, at the pass where\r\nwe crossed it, is only about sixty yards wide; generally it must be\r\nnearly double that width. Its course is very tortuous, being marked by\r\nwillow-trees and beds of reeds: in a direct line the distance to the\r\nmouth of the river is said to be nine leagues, but by water\r\ntwenty-five.  We were delayed crossing in the canoe by some immense\r\ntroops of mares, which were swimming the river in order to follow a\r\ndivision of troops into the interior.  A more ludicrous spectacle I\r\nnever beheld than the hundreds and hundreds of heads, all directed one\r\nway, with pointed ears and distended snorting nostrils, appearing just\r\nabove the water like a great shoal of some amphibious animal. Mare's\r\nflesh is the only food which the soldiers have when on an expedition.\r\nThis gives them a great facility of movement; for the distance to which\r\nhorses can be driven over these plains is quite surprising: I have been\r\nassured that an unloaded horse can travel a hundred miles a day for\r\nmany days successively.\r\n\r\nThe encampment of General Rosas was close to the river. It consisted of\r\na square formed by waggons, artillery, straw huts, etc.  The soldiers\r\nwere nearly all cavalry; and I should think such a villainous,\r\nbanditti-like army was never before collected together.  The greater\r\nnumber of men were of a mixed breed, between Negro, Indian, and\r\nSpaniard.  I know not the reason, but men of such origin seldom have a\r\ngood expression of countenance.  I called on the Secretary to show my\r\npassport.  He began to cross-question me in the most dignified and\r\nmysterious manner.  By good luck I had a letter of recommendation from\r\nthe government of Buenos Ayres [5] to the commandant of Patagones. This\r\nwas taken to General Rosas, who sent me a very obliging message; and\r\nthe Secretary returned all smiles and graciousness.  We took up our\r\nresidence in the _rancho_, or hovel, of a curious old Spaniard, who had\r\nserved with Napoleon in the expedition against Russia.\r\n\r\nWe stayed two days at the Colorado; I had little to do, for the\r\nsurrounding country was a swamp, which in summer (December), when the\r\nsnow melts on the Cordillera, is over-flowed by the river.  My chief\r\namusement was watching the Indian families as they came to buy little\r\narticles at the rancho where we stayed.  It was supposed that General\r\nRosas had about six hundred Indian allies.  The men were a tall, fine\r\nrace, yet it was afterwards easy to see in the Fuegian savage the same\r\ncountenance rendered hideous by cold, want of food, and less\r\ncivilization.  Some authors, in defining the primary races of mankind,\r\nhave separated these Indians into two classes; but this is certainly\r\nincorrect.  Among the young women or chinas, some deserve to be called\r\neven beautiful.  Their hair was coarse, but bright and black; and they\r\nwore it in two plaits hanging down to the waist.  They had a high\r\ncolour, and eyes that glistened with brilliancy; their legs, feet, and\r\narms were small and elegantly formed; their ankles, and sometimes their\r\nwrists, were ornamented by broad bracelets of blue beads.  Nothing\r\ncould be more interesting than some of the family groups.  A mother\r\nwith one or two daughters would often come to our rancho, mounted on\r\nthe same horse.  They ride like men, but with their knees tucked up\r\nmuch higher. This habit, perhaps, arises from their being accustomed,\r\nwhen travelling, to ride the loaded horses.  The duty of the women is\r\nto load and unload the horses; to make the tents for the night; in\r\nshort to be, like the wives of all savages, useful slaves.  The men\r\nfight, hunt, take care of the horses, and make the riding gear.  One of\r\ntheir chief indoor occupations is to knock two stones together till\r\nthey become round, in order to make the bolas.  With this important\r\nweapon the Indian catches his game, and also his horse, which roams\r\nfree over the plain.  In fighting, his first attempt is to throw down\r\nthe horse of his adversary with the bolas, and when entangled by the\r\nfall to kill him with the chuzo.  If the balls only catch the neck or\r\nbody of an animal, they are often carried away and lost.  As the making\r\nthe stones round is the labour of two days, the manufacture of the\r\nballs is a very common employment.  Several of the men and women had\r\ntheir faces painted red, but I never saw the horizontal bands which are\r\nso common among the Fuegians.  Their chief pride consists in having\r\neverything made of silver; I have seen a cacique with his spurs,\r\nstirrups, handle of his knife, and bridle made of this metal: the\r\nhead-stall and reins being of wire, were not thicker than whipcord; and\r\nto see a fiery steed wheeling about under the command of so light a\r\nchain, gave to the horsemanship a remarkable character of elegance.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosas intimated a wish to see me; a circumstance which I was\r\nafterwards very glad of.  He is a man of an extraordinary character,\r\nand has a most predominant influence in the country, which it seems he\r\nwill use to its prosperity and advancement. [6] He is said to be the\r\nowner of seventy-four square leagues of land, and to have about three\r\nhundred thousand head of cattle.  His estates are admirably managed,\r\nand are far more productive of corn than those of others.  He first\r\ngained his celebrity by his laws for his own estancias, and by\r\ndisciplining several hundred men, so as to resist with success the\r\nattacks of the Indians.  There are many stories current about the rigid\r\nmanner in which his laws were enforced.  One of these was, that no man,\r\non penalty of being put into the stocks, should carry his knife on a\r\nSunday: this being the principal day for gambling and drinking, many\r\nquarrels arose, which from the general manner of fighting with the\r\nknife often proved fatal.  One Sunday the Governor came in great form\r\nto pay the estancia a visit, and General Rosas, in his hurry, walked\r\nout to receive him with his knife, as usual, stuck in his belt.  The\r\nsteward touched his arm, and reminded him of the law; upon which\r\nturning to the Governor, he said he was extremely sorry, but that he\r\nmust go into the stocks, and that till let out, he possessed no power\r\neven in his own house.  After a little time the steward was persuaded\r\nto open the stocks, and to let him out, but no sooner was this done,\r\nthan he turned to the steward and said, \"You now have broken the laws,\r\nso you must take my place in the stocks.\" Such actions as these\r\ndelighted the Gauchos, who all possess high notions of their own\r\nequality and dignity.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosas is also a perfect horseman--an accomplishment of no small\r\nconsequence In a country where an assembled army elected its general by\r\nthe following trial: A troop of unbroken horses being driven into a\r\ncorral, were let out through a gateway, above which was a cross-bar: it\r\nwas agreed whoever should drop from the bar on one of these wild\r\nanimals, as it rushed out, and should be able, without saddle or\r\nbridle, not only to ride it, but also to bring it back to the door of\r\nthe corral, should be their general.  The person who succeeded was\r\naccordingly elected; and doubtless made a fit general for such an army.\r\nThis extraordinary feat has also been performed by Rosas.\r\n\r\nBy these means, and by conforming to the dress and habits of the\r\nGauchos, he has obtained an unbounded popularity in the country, and in\r\nconsequence a despotic power.  I was assured by an English merchant,\r\nthat a man who had murdered another, when arrested and questioned\r\nconcerning his motive, answered, \"He spoke disrespectfully of General\r\nRosas, so I killed him.\" At the end of a week the murderer was at\r\nliberty.  This doubtless was the act of the general's party, and not of\r\nthe general himself.\r\n\r\nIn conversation he is enthusiastic, sensible, and very grave.  His\r\ngravity is carried to a high pitch: I heard one of his mad buffoons\r\n(for he keeps two, like the barons of old) relate the following\r\nanecdote.  \"I wanted very much to hear a certain piece of music, so I\r\nwent to the general two or three times to ask him; he said to me, 'Go\r\nabout your business, for I am engaged.' I went a second time; he said,\r\n'If you come again I will punish you.' A third time I asked, and he\r\nlaughed.  I rushed out of the tent, but it was too late--he ordered two\r\nsoldiers to catch and stake me.  I begged by all the saints in heaven\r\nhe would let me off; but it would not do,--when the general laughs he\r\nspares neither mad man nor sound.\" The poor flighty gentleman looked\r\nquite dolorous, at the very recollection of the staking.  This is a\r\nvery severe punishment; four posts are driven into the ground, and the\r\nman is extended by his arms and legs horizontally, and there left to\r\nstretch for several hours. The idea is evidently taken from the usual\r\nmethod of drying hides.  My interview passed away, without a smile, and\r\nI obtained a passport and order for the government post-horses, and\r\nthis he gave me in the most obliging and ready manner.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we started for Bahia Blanca, which we reached in two\r\ndays.  Leaving the regular encampment, we passed by the toldos of the\r\nIndians.  These are round like ovens, and covered with hides; by the\r\nmouth of each, a tapering chuzo was stuck in the ground.  The toldos\r\nwere divided into separate groups, which belong to the different\r\ncaciques' tribes, and the groups were again divided into smaller ones,\r\naccording to the relationship of the owners.  For several miles we\r\ntravelled along the valley of the Colorado.  The alluvial plains on the\r\nside appeared fertile, and it is supposed that they are well adapted to\r\nthe growth of corn.  Turning northward from the river, we soon entered\r\non a country, differing from the plains south of the river.  The land\r\nstill continued dry and sterile: but it supported many different kinds\r\nof plants, and the grass, though brown and withered, was more abundant,\r\nas the thorny bushes were less so.  These latter in a short space\r\nentirely disappeared, and the plains were left without a thicket to\r\ncover their nakedness.  This change in the vegetation marks the\r\ncommencement of the grand calcareo argillaceous deposit, which forms\r\nthe wide extent of the Pampas, and covers the granitic rocks of Banda\r\nOriental.  From the Strait of Magellan to the Colorado, a distance of\r\nabout eight hundred miles, the face of the country is everywhere\r\ncomposed of shingle: the pebbles are chiefly of porphyry, and probably\r\nowe their origin to the rocks of the Cordillera.  North of the Colorado\r\nthis bed thins out, and the pebbles become exceedingly small, and here\r\nthe characteristic vegetation of Patagonia ceases.\r\n\r\nHaving ridden about twenty-five miles, we came to a broad belt of\r\nsand-dunes, which stretches, as far as the eye can reach, to the east\r\nand west.  The sand-hillocks resting on the clay, allow small pools of\r\nwater to collect, and thus afford in this dry country an invaluable\r\nsupply of fresh water.  The great advantage arising from depressions\r\nand elevations of the soil, is not often brought home to the mind. The\r\ntwo miserable springs in the long passage between the Rio Negro and\r\nColorado were caused by trifling inequalities in the plain, without\r\nthem not a drop of water would have been found.  The belt of sand-dunes\r\nis about eight miles wide; at some former period, it probably formed\r\nthe margin of a grand estuary, where the Colorado now flows.  In this\r\ndistrict, where absolute proofs of the recent elevation of the land\r\noccur, such speculations can hardly be neglected by any one, although\r\nmerely considering the physical geography of the country.  Having\r\ncrossed the sandy tract, we arrived in the evening at one of the\r\npost-houses; and, as the fresh horses were grazing at a distance we\r\ndetermined to pass the night there.\r\n\r\nThe house was situated at the base of a ridge between one and two\r\nhundred feet high--a most remarkable feature in this country.  This\r\nposta was commanded by a negro lieutenant, born in Africa: to his\r\ncredit be it said, there was not a ranche between the Colorado and\r\nBuenos Ayres in nearly such neat order as his.  He had a little room\r\nfor strangers, and a small corral for the horses, all made of sticks\r\nand reeds; he had also dug a ditch round his house as a defence in case\r\nof being attacked.  This would, however, have been of little avail, if\r\nthe Indians had come; but his chief comfort seemed to rest in the\r\nthought of selling his life dearly.  A short time before, a body of\r\nIndians had travelled past in the night; if they had been aware of the\r\nposta, our black friend and his four soldiers would assuredly have been\r\nslaughtered.  I did not anywhere meet a more civil and obliging man\r\nthan this negro; it was therefore the more painful to see that he would\r\nnot sit down and eat with us.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we sent for the horses very early, and started for\r\nanother exhilarating gallop.  We passed the Cabeza del Buey, an old\r\nname given to the head of a large marsh, which extends from Bahia\r\nBlanca.  Here we changed horses, and passed through some leagues of\r\nswamps and saline marshes.  Changing horses for the last time, we again\r\nbegan wading through the mud.  My animal fell and I was well soused in\r\nblack mire--a very disagreeable accident when one does not possess a\r\nchange of clothes.  Some miles from the fort we met a man, who told us\r\nthat a great gun had been fired, which is a signal that Indians are\r\nnear.  We immediately left the road, and followed the edge of a marsh,\r\nwhich when chased offers the best mode of escape.  We were glad to\r\narrive within the walls, when we found all the alarm was about nothing,\r\nfor the Indians turned out to be friendly ones, who wished to join\r\nGeneral Rosas.\r\n\r\nBahia Blanca scarcely deserves the name of a village.  A few houses and\r\nthe barracks for the troops are enclosed by a deep ditch and fortified\r\nwall.  The settlement is only of recent standing (since 1828); and its\r\ngrowth has been one of trouble.  The government of Buenos Ayres\r\nunjustly occupied it by force, instead of following the wise example of\r\nthe Spanish Viceroys, who purchased the land near the older settlement\r\nof the Rio Negro, from the Indians.  Hence the need of the\r\nfortifications; hence the few houses and little cultivated land without\r\nthe limits of the walls; even the cattle are not safe from the attacks\r\nof the Indians beyond the boundaries of the plain, on which the\r\nfortress stands.\r\n\r\nThe part of the harbour where the Beagle intended to anchor being\r\ndistant twenty-five miles, I obtained from the Commandant a guide and\r\nhorses, to take me to see whether she had arrived.  Leaving the plain\r\nof green turf, which extended along the course of a little brook, we\r\nsoon entered on a wide level waste consisting either of sand, saline\r\nmarshes, or bare mud.  Some parts were clothed by low thickets, and\r\nothers with those succulent plants, which luxuriate only where salt\r\nabounds.  Bad as the country was, ostriches, deer, agoutis, and\r\narmadilloes, were abundant.  My guide told me, that two months before\r\nhe had a most narrow escape of his life: he was out hunting with two\r\nother men, at no great distance from this part of the country, when\r\nthey were suddenly met by a party of Indians, who giving chase, soon\r\novertook and killed his two friends.  His own horse's legs were also\r\ncaught by the bolas, but he jumped off, and with his knife cut them\r\nfree: while doing this he was obliged to dodge round his horse, and\r\nreceived two severe wounds from their chuzos.  Springing on the saddle,\r\nhe managed, by a most wonderful exertion, just to keep ahead of the\r\nlong spears of his pursuers, who followed him to within sight of the\r\nfort.  From that time there was an order that no one should stray far\r\nfrom the settlement.  I did not know of this when I started, and was\r\nsurprised to observe how earnestly my guide watched a deer, which\r\nappeared to have been frightened from a distant quarter.\r\n\r\nWe found the Beagle had not arrived, and consequently set out on our\r\nreturn, but the horses soon tiring, we were obliged to bivouac on the\r\nplain.  In the morning we had caught an armadillo, which although a\r\nmost excellent dish when roasted in its shell, did not make a very\r\nsubstantial breakfast and dinner for two hungry men.  The ground at the\r\nplace where we stopped for the night, was incrusted with a layer of\r\nsulphate of soda, and hence, of course, was without water.  Yet many of\r\nthe smaller rodents managed to exist even here, and the tucutuco was\r\nmaking its odd little grunt beneath my head, during half the night. Our\r\nhorses were very poor ones, and in the morning they were soon exhausted\r\nfrom not having had anything to drink, so that we were obliged to walk.\r\nAbout noon the dogs killed a kid, which we roasted. I ate some of it,\r\nbut it made me intolerably thirsty.  This was the more distressing as\r\nthe road, from some recent rain, was full of little puddles of clear\r\nwater, yet not a drop was drinkable.  I had scarcely been twenty hours\r\nwithout water, and only part of the time under a hot sun, yet the\r\nthirst rendered me very weak.  How people survive two or three days\r\nunder such circumstances, I cannot imagine: at the same time, I must\r\nconfess that my guide did not suffer at all, and was astonished that\r\none day's deprivation should be so troublesome to me.\r\n\r\nI have several times alluded to the surface of the ground being\r\nincrusted with salt.  This phenomenon is quite different from that of\r\nthe salinas, and more extraordinary. In many parts of South America,\r\nwherever the climate is moderately dry, these incrustations occur; but\r\nI have nowhere seen them so abundant as near Bahia Blanca.  The salt\r\nhere, and in other parts of Patagonia, consists chiefly of sulphate of\r\nsoda with some common salt.  As long as the ground remains moist in the\r\nsalitrales (as the Spaniards improperly call them, mistaking this\r\nsubstance for saltpeter), nothing is to be seen but an extensive plain\r\ncomposed of a black, muddy soil, supporting scattered tufts of\r\nsucculent plants.  On returning through one of these tracts, after a\r\nweek's hot weather, one is surprised to see square miles of the plain\r\nwhite, as if from a slight fall of snow, here and there heaped up by\r\nthe wind into little drifts.  This latter appearance is chiefly caused\r\nby the salts being drawn up, during the slow evaporation of the\r\nmoisture, round blades of dead grass, stumps of wood, and pieces of\r\nbroken earth, instead of being crystallized at the bottoms of the\r\npuddles of water.  The salitrales occur either on level tracts elevated\r\nonly a few feet above the level of the sea, or on alluvial land\r\nbordering rivers. M. Parchappe [7] found that the saline incrustation\r\non the plain, at the distance of some miles from the sea, consisted\r\nchiefly of sulphate of soda, with only seven per cent. of common salt;\r\nwhilst nearer to the coast, the common salt increased to 37 parts in a\r\nhundred.  This circumstance would tempt one to believe that the\r\nsulphate of soda is generated in the soil, from the muriate, left on\r\nthe surface during the slow and recent elevation of this dry country.\r\nThe whole phenomenon is well worthy the attention of naturalists.  Have\r\nthe succulent, salt-loving plants, which are well known to contain much\r\nsoda, the power of decomposing the muriate? Does the black fetid mud,\r\nabounding with organic matter, yield the sulphur and ultimately the\r\nsulphuric acid?\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards I again rode to the harbour: when not far from our\r\ndestination, my companion, the same man as before, spied three people\r\nhunting on horseback.  He immediately dismounted, and watching them\r\nintently, said, \"They don't ride like Christians, and nobody can leave\r\nthe fort.\" The three hunters joined company, and likewise dismounted\r\nfrom their horses.  At last one mounted again and rode over the hill\r\nout of sight.  My companion said, \"We must now get on our horses: load\r\nyour pistol;\" and he looked to his own sword.  I asked, \"Are they\r\nIndians?\"--\"Quien sabe? (who knows?) if there are no more than three,\r\nit does not signify.\" It then struck me, that the one man had gone over\r\nthe hill to fetch the rest of his tribe.  I suggested this; but all the\r\nanswer I could extort was, \"Quien sabe?\" His head and eye never for a\r\nminute ceased scanning slowly the distant horizon.  I thought his\r\nuncommon coolness too good a joke, and asked him why he did not return\r\nhome.  I was startled when he answered, \"We are returning, but in a\r\nline so as to pass near a swamp, into which we can gallop the horses as\r\nfar as they can go, and then trust to our own legs; so that there is no\r\ndanger.\" I did not feel quite so confident of this, and wanted to\r\nincrease our pace.  He said, \"No, not until they do.\" When any little\r\ninequality concealed us, we galloped; but when in sight, continued\r\nwalking.  At last we reached a valley, and turning to the left,\r\ngalloped quickly to the foot of a hill; he gave me his horse to hold,\r\nmade the dogs lie down, and then crawled on his hands and knees to\r\nreconnoitre.  He remained in this position for some time, and at last,\r\nbursting out in laughter, exclaimed, \"Mugeres!\" (women!).  He knew them\r\nto be the wife and sister-in-law of the major's son, hunting for\r\nostrich's eggs.  I have described this man's conduct, because he acted\r\nunder the full impression that they were Indians. As soon, however, as\r\nthe absurd mistake was found out, he gave me a hundred reasons why they\r\ncould not have been Indians; but all these were forgotten at the time.\r\nWe then rode on in peace and quietness to a low point called Punta\r\nAlta, whence we could see nearly the whole of the great harbour of\r\nBahia Blanca.\r\n\r\nThe wide expanse of water is choked up by numerous great mud-banks,\r\nwhich the inhabitants call Cangrejales, or _crabberies_, from the\r\nnumber of small crabs.  The mud is so soft that it is impossible to\r\nwalk over them, even for the shortest distance.  Many of the banks have\r\ntheir surfaces covered with long rushes, the tops of which alone are\r\nvisible at high water.  On one occasion, when in a boat, we were so\r\nentangled by these shallows that we could hardly find our way.  Nothing\r\nwas visible but the flat beds of mud; the day was not very clear, and\r\nthere was much refraction, or as the sailors expressed it, \"things\r\nloomed high.\" The only object within our view which was not level was\r\nthe horizon; rushes looked like bushes unsupported in the air, and\r\nwater like mud-banks, and mud-banks like water.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night in Punta Alta, and I employed myself in searching\r\nfor fossil bones; this point being a perfect catacomb for monsters of\r\nextinct races.  The evening was perfectly calm and clear; the extreme\r\nmonotony of the view gave it an interest even in the midst of mud-banks\r\nand gulls sand-hillocks and solitary vultures.  In riding back in the\r\nmorning we came across a very fresh track of a Puma, but did not\r\nsucceed in finding it.  We saw also a couple of Zorillos, or\r\nskunks,--odious animals, which are far from uncommon.  In general\r\nappearance, the Zorillo resembles a polecat, but it is rather larger,\r\nand much thicker in proportion. Conscious of its power, it roams by day\r\nabout the open plain, and fears neither dog nor man.  If a dog is urged\r\nto the attack, its courage is instantly checked by a few drops of the\r\nfetid oil, which brings on violent sickness and running at the nose.\r\nWhatever is once polluted by it, is for ever useless.  Azara says the\r\nsmell can be perceived at a league distant; more than once, when\r\nentering the harbour of Monte Video, the wind being off shore, we have\r\nperceived the odour on board the Beagle.  Certain it is, that every\r\nanimal most willingly makes room for the Zorillo.\r\n\r\n[1] The corral is an enclosure made of tall and strong stakes.  Every\r\nestancia, or farming estate, has one attached to it.\r\n\r\n[2] The hovels of the Indians are thus called.\r\n\r\n[3] Report of the Agricult. Chem. Assoc. in the Agricult. Gazette,\r\n1845, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[4] Linnaean Trans., vol. xi. p. 205. It is remarkable how all the\r\ncircumstances connected with the salt-lakes in Siberia and Patagonia\r\nare similar.  Siberia, like Patagonia, appears to have been recently\r\nelevated above the waters of the sea. In both countries the salt-lakes\r\noccupy shallow depressions in the plains; in both the mud on the\r\nborders is black and fetid; beneath the crust of common salt, sulphate\r\nof soda or of magnesium occurs, imperfectly crystallized; and in both,\r\nthe muddy sand is mixed with lentils of gypsum.  The Siberian\r\nsalt-lakes are inhabited by small crustaceous animals; and flamingoes\r\n(Edin. New Philos. Jour., Jan 1830) likewise frequent them.  As these\r\ncircumstances, apparently so trifling, occur in two distant continents,\r\nwe may feel sure that they are the necessary results of a common\r\ncause--See Pallas's Travels, 1793 to 1794, pp. 129 - 134.\r\n\r\n[5] I am bound to express in the strongest terms, my obligation to the\r\ngovernment of Buenos Ayres for the obliging manner in which passports\r\nto all parts of the country were given me, as naturalist of the Beagle.\r\n\r\n[6] This prophecy has turned out entirely and miserably wrong. 1845.\r\n\r\n[7] Voyage dans l'Amerique Merid. par M.

With Captain Fitz Roy's consent I was left\r\nbehind, to travel by land to Buenos Ayres.  I will here add some\r\nobservations, which were made during this visit and on a previous\r\noccasion, when the Beagle was employed in surveying the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe plain, at the distance of a few miles from the coast, belongs to\r\nthe great Pampean formation, which consists in part of a reddish clay,\r\nand in part of a highly calcareous marly rock.  Nearer the coast there\r\nare some plains formed from the wreck of the upper plain, and from mud,\r\ngravel, and sand thrown up by the sea during the slow elevation of the\r\nland, of which elevation we have evidence in upraised beds of recent\r\nshells, and in rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over the country. At\r\nPunta Alta we have a section of one of these later-formed little\r\nplains, which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary\r\ncharacter of the remains of gigantic land-animals embedded in it. These\r\nhave been fully described by Professor Owen, in the Zoology of the\r\nvoyage of the Beagle, and are deposited in the College of Surgeons. I\r\nwill here give only a brief outline of their nature.\r\n\r\nFirst, parts of three heads and other bones of the Megatherium, the\r\nhuge dimensions of which are expressed by its name.  Secondly, the\r\nMegalonyx, a great allied animal. Thirdly, the Scelidotherium, also an\r\nallied animal, of which I obtained a nearly perfect skeleton.  It must\r\nhave been as large as a rhinoceros: in the structure of its head it\r\ncomes according to Mr. Owen, nearest to the Cape Anteater, but in some\r\nother respects it approaches to the armadilloes. Fourthly, the Mylodon\r\nDarwinii, a closely related genus of little inferior size.  Fifthly,\r\nanother gigantic edental quadruped. Sixthly, a large animal, with an\r\nosseous coat in compartments, very like that of an armadillo.\r\nSeventhly, an extinct kind of horse, to which I shall have again to\r\nrefer. Eighthly, a tooth of a Pachydermatous animal, probably the same\r\nwith the Macrauchenia, a huge beast with a long neck like a camel,\r\nwhich I shall also refer to again.  Lastly, the Toxodon, perhaps one of\r\nthe strangest animals ever discovered: in size it equalled an elephant\r\nor megatherium, but the structure of its teeth, as Mr. Owen states,\r\nproves indisputably that it was intimately related to the Gnawers, the\r\norder which, at the present day, includes most of the smallest\r\nquadrupeds: in many details it is allied to the Pachydermata: judging\r\nfrom the position of its eyes, ears, and nostrils, it was probably\r\naquatic, like the Dugong and Manatee, to which it is also allied.  How\r\nwonderfully are the different Orders, at the present time so well\r\nseparated, blended together in different points of the structure of the\r\nToxodon!\r\n\r\nThe remains of these nine great quadrupeds, and many detached bones,\r\nwere found embedded on the beach, within the space of about 200 yards\r\nsquare.  It is a remarkable circumstance that so many different species\r\nshould be found together; and it proves how numerous in kind the\r\nancient inhabitants of this country must have been.  At the distance of\r\nabout thirty miles from Punta Alta, in a cliff of red earth, I found\r\nseveral fragments of bones, some of large size. Among them were the\r\nteeth of a gnawer, equalling in size and closely resembling those of\r\nthe Capybara, whose habits have been described; and therefore,\r\nprobably, an aquatic animal.  There was also part of the head of a\r\nCtenomys; the species being different from the Tucutuco, but with a\r\nclose general resemblance.  The red earth, like that of the Pampas, in\r\nwhich these remains were embedded, contains, according to Professor\r\nEhrenberg, eight fresh-water and one salt-water infusorial animalcule;\r\ntherefore, probably, it was an estuary deposit.\r\n\r\nThe remains at Punta Alta were embedded in stratified gravel and\r\nreddish mud, just such as the sea might now wash up on a shallow bank.\r\nThey were associated with twenty-three species of shells, of which\r\nthirteen are recent and four others very closely related to recent\r\nforms. [1] From the bones of the Scelidotherium, including even the\r\nknee-cap, being intombed in their proper relative positions, and from\r\nthe osseous armour of the great armadillo-like animal being so well\r\npreserved, together with the bones of one of its legs, we may feel\r\nassured that these remains were fresh and united by their ligaments,\r\nwhen deposited in the gravel together with the shells. [2] Hence we\r\nhave good evidence that the above enumerated gigantic quadrupeds, more\r\ndifferent from those of the present day than the oldest of the tertiary\r\nquadrupeds of Europe, lived whilst the sea was peopled with most of its\r\npresent inhabitants; and we have confirmed that remarkable law so often\r\ninsisted on by Mr. Lyell, namely, that the \"longevity of the species in\r\nthe mammalia is upon the whole inferior to that of the testacea.\" [3]\r\n\r\nThe great size of the bones of the Megatheroid animals, including the\r\nMegatherium, Megalonyx, Scelidotherium, and Mylodon, is truly\r\nwonderful.  The habits of life of these animals were a complete puzzle\r\nto naturalists, until Professor Owen [4] solved the problem with\r\nremarkable ingenuity.  The teeth indicate, by their simple structure,\r\nthat these Megatheroid animals lived on vegetable food, and probably on\r\nthe leaves and small twigs of trees; their ponderous forms and great\r\nstrong curved claws seem so little adapted for locomotion, that some\r\neminent naturalists have actually believed, that, like the sloths, to\r\nwhich they are intimately related, they subsisted by climbing back\r\ndownwards on trees, and feeding on the leaves.  It was a bold, not to\r\nsay preposterous, idea to conceive even antediluvian trees, with\r\nbranches strong enough to bear animals as large as elephants. Professor\r\nOwen, with far more probability, believes that, instead of climbing on\r\nthe trees, they pulled the branches down to them, and tore up the\r\nsmaller ones by the roots, and so fed on the leaves.  The colossal\r\nbreadth and weight of their hinder quarters, which can hardly be\r\nimagined without having been seen, become on this view, of obvious\r\nservice, instead of being an incumbrance: their apparent clumsiness\r\ndisappears. With their great tails and their huge heels firmly fixed\r\nlike a tripod on the ground, they could freely exert the full force of\r\ntheir most powerful arms and great claws.  Strongly rooted, indeed,\r\nmust that tree have been, which could have resisted such force!  The\r\nMylodon, moreover, was furnished with a long extensile tongue like that\r\nof the giraffe, which, by one of those beautiful provisions of nature,\r\nthus reaches with the aid of its long neck its leafy food.  I may\r\nremark, that in Abyssinia the elephant, according to Bruce, when it\r\ncannot reach with its proboscis the branches, deeply scores with its\r\ntusks the trunk of the tree, up and down and all round, till it is\r\nsufficiently weakened to be broken down.\r\n\r\nThe beds including the above fossil remains, stand only from fifteen to\r\ntwenty feet above the level of high-water; and hence the elevation of\r\nthe land has been small (without there has been an intercalated period\r\nof subsidence, of which we have no evidence) since the great quadrupeds\r\nwandered over the surrounding plains; and the external features of the\r\ncountry must then have been very nearly the same as now.  What, it may\r\nnaturally be asked, was the character of the vegetation at that period;\r\nwas the country as wretchedly sterile as it now is?  As so many of the\r\nco-embedded shells are the same with those now living in the bay, I was\r\nat first inclined to think that the former vegetation was probably\r\nsimilar to the existing one; but this would have been an erroneous\r\ninference for some of these same shells live on the luxuriant coast of\r\nBrazil; and generally, the character of the inhabitants of the sea are\r\nuseless as guides to judge of those on the land.  Nevertheless, from\r\nthe following considerations, I do not believe that the simple fact of\r\nmany gigantic quadrupeds having lived on the plains round Bahia Blanca,\r\nis any sure guide that they formerly were clothed with a luxuriant\r\nvegetation: I have no doubt that the sterile country a little\r\nsouthward, near the Rio Negro, with its scattered thorny trees, would\r\nsupport many and large quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat large animals require a luxuriant vegetation, has been a general\r\nassumption which has passed from one work to another; but I do not\r\nhesitate to say that it is completely false, and that it has vitiated\r\nthe reasoning of geologists on some points of great interest in the\r\nancient history of the world.  The prejudice has probably been derived\r\nfrom India, and the Indian islands, where troops of elephants, noble\r\nforests, and impenetrable jungles, are associated together in every\r\none's mind.  If, however, we refer to any work of travels through the\r\nsouthern parts of Africa, we shall find allusions in almost every page\r\neither to the desert character of the country, or to the numbers of\r\nlarge animals inhabiting it.  The same thing is rendered evident by the\r\nmany engravings which have been published of various parts of the\r\ninterior.  When the Beagle was at Cape Town, I made an excursion of\r\nsome days' length into the country, which at least was sufficient to\r\nrender that which I had read more fully intelligible.\r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Smith, who, at the head of his adventurous party, has lately\r\nsucceeded in passing the Tropic of Capricorn, informs me that, taking\r\ninto consideration the whole of the southern part of Africa, there can\r\nbe no doubt of its being a sterile country.  On the southern and\r\nsouth-eastern coasts there are some fine forests, but with these\r\nexceptions, the traveller may pass for days together through open\r\nplains, covered by a poor and scanty vegetation.  It is difficult to\r\nconvey any accurate idea of degrees of comparative fertility; but it\r\nmay be safely said that the amount of vegetation supported at any one\r\ntime [5] by Great Britain, exceeds, perhaps even tenfold, the quantity\r\non an equal area, in the interior parts of Southern Africa.  The fact\r\nthat bullock-waggons can travel in any direction, excepting near the\r\ncoast, without more than occasionally half an hour's delay in cutting\r\ndown bushes, gives, perhaps, a more definite notion of the scantiness\r\nof the vegetation.  Now, if we look to the animals inhabiting these\r\nwide plains, we shall find their numbers extraordinarily great, and\r\ntheir bulk immense.  We must enumerate the elephant, three species of\r\nrhinoceros, and probably, according to Dr. Smith, two others, the\r\nhippopotamus, the giraffe, the bos caffer--as large as a full-grown\r\nbull, and the elan--but little less, two zebras, and the quaccha, two\r\ngnus, and several antelopes even larger than these latter animals.  It\r\nmay be supposed that although the species are numerous, the individuals\r\nof each kind are few. By the kindness of Dr. Smith, I am enabled to\r\nshow that the case is very different.  He informs me, that in lat. 24\r\ndegs., in one day's march with the bullock-waggons, he saw, without\r\nwandering to any great distance on either side, between one hundred and\r\none hundred and fifty rhinoceroses, which belonged to three species:\r\nthe same day he saw several herds of giraffes, amounting together to\r\nnearly a hundred; and that although no elephant was observed, yet they\r\nare found in this district.  At the distance of a little more than one\r\nhour's march from their place of encampment on the previous night, his\r\nparty actually killed at one spot eight hippopotamuses, and saw many\r\nmore.  In this same river there were likewise crocodiles.  Of course it\r\nwas a case quite extraordinary, to see so many great animals crowded\r\ntogether, but it evidently proves that they must exist in great\r\nnumbers. Dr. Smith describes the country passed through that day, as\r\n\"being thinly covered with grass, and bushes about four feet high, and\r\nstill more thinly with mimosa-trees.\" The waggons were not prevented\r\ntravelling in a nearly straight line.\r\n\r\nBesides these large animals, every one the least acquainted with the\r\nnatural history of the Cape, has read of the herds of antelopes, which\r\ncan be compared only with the flocks of migratory birds.  The numbers\r\nindeed of the lion, panther, and hyaena, and the multitude of birds of\r\nprey, plainly speak of the abundance of the smaller quadrupeds: one\r\nevening seven lions were counted at the same time prowling round Dr.\r\nSmith's encampment.  As this able naturalist remarked to me, the\r\ncarnage each day in Southern Africa must indeed be terrific!  I confess\r\nit is truly surprising how such a number of animals can find support in\r\na country producing so little food.  The larger quadrupeds no doubt\r\nroam over wide tracts in search of it; and their food chiefly consists\r\nof underwood, which probably contains much nutriment in a small bulk.\r\nDr. Smith also informs me that the vegetation has a rapid growth; no\r\nsooner is a part consumed, than its place is supplied by a fresh stock.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that our ideas respecting the apparent\r\namount of food necessary for the support of large quadrupeds are much\r\nexaggerated: it should have been remembered that the camel, an animal\r\nof no mean bulk, has always been considered as the emblem of the desert.\r\n\r\nThe belief that where large quadrupeds exist, the vegetation must\r\nnecessarily be luxuriant, is the more remarkable, because the converse\r\nis far from true.  Mr. Burchell observed to me that when entering\r\nBrazil, nothing struck him more forcibly than the splendour of the\r\nSouth American vegetation contrasted with that of South Africa,\r\ntogether with the absence of all large quadrupeds.  In his Travels, [6]\r\nhe has suggested that the comparison of the respective weights (if\r\nthere were sufficient data) of an equal number of the largest\r\nherbivorous quadrupeds of each country would be extremely curious.  If\r\nwe take on the one side, the elephant, [7] hippopotamus, giraffe, bos\r\ncaffer, elan, certainly three, and probably five species of rhinoceros;\r\nand on the American side, two tapirs, the guanaco, three deer, the\r\nvicuna, peccari, capybara (after which we must choose from the monkeys\r\nto complete the number), and then place these two groups alongside each\r\nother, it is not easy to conceive ranks more disproportionate in size.\r\nAfter the above facts, we are compelled to conclude, against anterior\r\nprobability, [8] that among the mammalia there exists no close relation\r\nbetween the bulk of the species, and the _quantity_ of the vegetation,\r\nin the countries which they inhabit.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the number of large quadrupeds, there certainly exists\r\nno quarter of the globe which will bear comparison with Southern\r\nAfrica.  After the different statements which have been given, the\r\nextremely desert character of that region will not be disputed.  In the\r\nEuropean division of the world, we must look back to the tertiary\r\nepochs, to find a condition of things among the mammalia, resembling\r\nthat now existing at the Cape of Good Hope.  Those tertiary epochs,\r\nwhich we are apt to consider as abounding to an astonishing degree with\r\nlarge animals, because we find the remains of many ages accumulated at\r\ncertain spots, could hardly boast of more large quadrupeds than\r\nSouthern Africa does at present.  If we speculate on the condition of\r\nthe vegetation during these epochs we are at least bound so far to\r\nconsider existing analogies, as not to urge as absolutely necessary a\r\nluxuriant vegetation, when we see a state of things so totally\r\ndifferent at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nWe know [9] that the extreme regions of North America, many degrees\r\nbeyond the limit where the ground at the depth of a few feet remains\r\nperpetually congealed, are covered by forests of large and tall trees.\r\nIn a like manner, in Siberia, we have woods of birch, fir, aspen, and\r\nlarch, growing in a latitude [10] (64 degs.) where the mean temperature\r\nof the air falls below the freezing point, and where the earth is so\r\ncompletely frozen, that the carcass of an animal embedded in it is\r\nperfectly preserved.  With these facts we must grant, as far as\r\n_quantity alone_ of vegetation is concerned, that the great quadrupeds\r\nof the later tertiary epochs might, in most parts of Northern Europe\r\nand Asia, have lived on the spots where their remains are now found.  I\r\ndo not here speak of the kind of vegetation necessary for their\r\nsupport; because, as there is evidence of physical changes, and as the\r\nanimals have become extinct, so may we suppose that the species of\r\nplants have likewise been changed.\r\n\r\nThese remarks, I may be permitted to add, directly bear on the case of\r\nthe Siberian animals preserved in ice.  The firm conviction of the\r\nnecessity of a vegetation possessing a character of tropical\r\nluxuriance, to support such large animals, and the impossibility of\r\nreconciling this with the proximity of perpetual congelation, was one\r\nchief cause of the several theories of sudden revolutions of climate,\r\nand of overwhelming catastrophes, which were invented to account for\r\ntheir entombment.  I am far from supposing that the climate has not\r\nchanged since the period when those animals lived, which now lie buried\r\nin the ice.  At present I only wish to show, that as far as _quantity_\r\nof food _alone_ is concerned, the ancient rhinoceroses might have\r\nroamed over the _steppes_ of central Siberia (the northern parts\r\nprobably being under water) even in their present condition, as well as\r\nthe living rhinoceroses and elephants over the _Karros_ of Southern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will now give an account of the habits of some of the more\r\ninteresting birds which are common on the wild plains of Northern\r\nPatagonia: and first for the largest, or South American ostrich.  The\r\nordinary habits of the ostrich are familiar to every one.  They live on\r\nvegetable matter, such as roots and grass; but at Bahia Blanca I have\r\nrepeatedly seen three or four come down at low water to the extensive\r\nmud-banks which are then dry, for the sake, as the Gauchos say, of\r\nfeeding on small fish.  Although the ostrich in its habits is so shy,\r\nwary, and solitary, and although so fleet in its pace, it is caught\r\nwithout much difficulty by the Indian or Gaucho armed with the bolas.\r\nWhen several horsemen appear in a semicircle, it becomes confounded,\r\nand does not know which way to escape.  They generally prefer running\r\nagainst the wind; yet at the first start they expand their wings, and\r\nlike a vessel make all sail.  On one fine hot day I saw several\r\nostriches enter a bed of tall rushes, where they squatted concealed,\r\ntill quite closely approached. It is not generally known that ostriches\r\nreadily take to the water.  Mr. King informs me that at the Bay of San\r\nBlas, and at Port Valdes in Patagonia, he saw these birds swimming\r\nseveral times from island to island.  They ran into the water both when\r\ndriven down to a point, and likewise of their own accord when not\r\nfrightened: the distance crossed was about two hundred yards.  When\r\nswimming, very little of their bodies appear above water; their necks\r\nare extended a little forward, and their progress is slow. On two\r\noccasions I saw some ostriches swimming across the Santa Cruz river,\r\nwhere its course was about four hundred yards wide, and the stream\r\nrapid.  Captain Sturt, [11] when descending the Murrumbidgee, in\r\nAustralia, saw two emus in the act of swimming.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the country readily distinguish, even at a distance,\r\nthe cock bird from the hen.  The former is larger and darker-coloured,\r\n[12] and has a bigger head.  The ostrich, I believe the cock, emits a\r\nsingular, deep-toned, hissing note: when first I heard it, standing in\r\nthe midst of some sand-hillocks, I thought it was made by some wild\r\nbeast, for it is a sound that one cannot tell whence it comes, or from\r\nhow far distant.  When we were at Bahia Blanca in the months of\r\nSeptember and October, the eggs, in extraordinary numbers, were found\r\nall over the country.  They lie either scattered and single, in which\r\ncase they are never hatched, and are called by the Spaniards huachos;\r\nor they are collected together into a shallow excavation, which forms\r\nthe nest.  Out of the four nests which I saw, three contained\r\ntwenty-two eggs each, and the fourth twenty-seven. In one day's hunting\r\non horseback sixty-four eggs were found; forty-four of these were in\r\ntwo nests, and the remaining twenty, scattered huachos.  The Gauchos\r\nunanimously affirm, and there is no reason to doubt their statement,\r\nthat the male bird alone hatches the eggs, and for some time afterwards\r\naccompanies the young.  The cock when on the nest lies very close; I\r\nhave myself almost ridden over one.  It is asserted that at such times\r\nthey are occasionally fierce, and even dangerous, and that they have\r\nbeen known to attack a man on horseback, trying to kick and leap on\r\nhim.  My informer pointed out to me an old man, whom he had seen much\r\nterrified by one chasing him.  I observe in Burchell's travels in South\r\nAfrica, that he remarks, \"Having killed a male ostrich, and the\r\nfeathers being dirty, it was said by the Hottentots to be a nest bird.\"\r\nI understand that the male emu in the Zoological Gardens takes charge\r\nof the nest: this habit, therefore, is common to the family.\r\n\r\nThe Gauchos unanimously affirm that several females lay in one nest.  I\r\nhave been positively told that four or five hen birds have been watched\r\nto go in the middle of the day, one after the other, to the same nest.\r\nI may add, also, that it is believed in Africa, that two or more\r\nfemales lay in one nest. [13] Although this habit at first appears very\r\nstrange, I think the cause may be explained in a simple manner.  The\r\nnumber of eggs in the nest varies from twenty to forty, and even to\r\nfifty; and according to Azara, some times to seventy or eighty.  Now,\r\nalthough it is most probable, from the number of eggs found in one\r\ndistrict being so extraordinarily great in proportion to the parent\r\nbirds, and likewise from the state of the ovarium of the hen, that she\r\nmay in the course of the season lay a large number, yet the time\r\nrequired must be very long.  Azara states, [14] that a female in a\r\nstate of domestication laid seventeen eggs, each at the interval of\r\nthree days one from another.  If the hen was obliged to hatch her own\r\neggs, before the last was laid the first probably would be addled; but\r\nif each laid a few eggs at successive periods, in different nests, and\r\nseveral hens, as is stated to be the case, combined together, then the\r\neggs in one collection would be nearly of the same age. If the number\r\nof eggs in one of these nests is, as I believe, not greater on an\r\naverage than the number laid by one female in the season, then there\r\nmust be as many nests as females, and each cock bird will have its fair\r\nshare of the labour of incubation; and that during a period when the\r\nfemales probably could not sit, from not having finished laying. [15] I\r\nhave before mentioned the great numbers of huachos, or deserted eggs;\r\nso that in one day's hunting twenty were found in this state.  It\r\nappears odd that so many should be wasted.  Does it not arise from the\r\ndifficulty of several females associating together, and finding a male\r\nready to undertake the office of incubation?  It is evident that there\r\nmust at first be some degree of association between at least two\r\nfemales; otherwise the eggs would remain scattered over the wide plain,\r\nat distances far too great to allow of the male collecting them into\r\none nest: some authors have believed that the scattered eggs were\r\ndeposited for the young birds to feed on.  This can hardly be the case\r\nin America, because the huachos, although often found addled and\r\nputrid, are generally whole.\r\n\r\nWhen at the Rio Negro in Northern Patagonia, I repeatedly heard the\r\nGauchos talking of a very rare bird which they called Avestruz Petise.\r\nThey described it as being less than the common ostrich (which is there\r\nabundant), but with a very close general resemblance.  They said its\r\ncolour was dark and mottled, and that its legs were shorter, and\r\nfeathered lower down than those of the common ostrich. It is more\r\neasily caught by the bolas than the other species. The few inhabitants\r\nwho had seen both kinds, affirmed they could distinguish them apart\r\nfrom a long distance.  The eggs of the small species appeared, however,\r\nmore generally known; and it was remarked, with surprise, that they\r\nwere very little less than those of the Rhea, but of a slightly\r\ndifferent form, and with a tinge of pale blue.  This species occurs\r\nmost rarely on the plains bordering the Rio Negro; but about a degree\r\nand a half further south they are tolerably abundant. When at Port\r\nDesire, in Patagonia (lat. 48 degs.), Mr. Martens shot an ostrich; and\r\nI looked at it, forgetting at the moment, in the most unaccountable\r\nmanner, the whole subject of the Petises, and thought it was a not\r\nfull-grown bird of the common sort.  It was cooked and eaten before my\r\nmemory returned.  Fortunately the head, neck, legs, wings, many of the\r\nlarger feathers, and a large part of the skin, had been preserved; and\r\nfrom these a very nearly perfect specimen has been put together, and is\r\nnow exhibited in the museum of the Zoological Society.  Mr. Gould, in\r\ndescribing this new species, has done me the honour of calling it after\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\nAmong the Patagonian Indians in the Strait of Magellan, we found a half\r\nIndian, who had lived some years with the tribe, but had been born in\r\nthe northern provinces.  I asked him if he had ever heard of the\r\nAvestruz Petise?  He answered by saying, \"Why, there are none others in\r\nthese southern countries.\" He informed me that the number of eggs in\r\nthe nest of the petise is considerably less than in that of the other\r\nkind, namely, not more than fifteen on an average, but he asserted that\r\nmore than one female deposited them.  At Santa Cruz we saw several of\r\nthese birds.  They were excessively wary: I think they could see a\r\nperson approaching when too far off to be distinguished themselves. In\r\nascending the river few were seen; but in our quiet and rapid descent,\r\nmany, in pairs and by fours or fives, were observed.  It was remarked\r\nthat this bird did not expand its wings, when first starting at full\r\nspeed, after the manner of the northern kind.  In conclusion I may\r\nobserve, that the Struthio rhea inhabits the country of La Plata as far\r\nas a little south of the Rio Negro in lat. 41 degs., and that the\r\nStruthio Darwinii takes its place in Southern Patagonia; the part about\r\nthe Rio Negro being neutral territory.  M. A. d'Orbigny, [16] when at\r\nthe Rio Negro, made great exertions to procure this bird, but never had\r\nthe good fortune to succeed.  Dobrizhoffer [17] long ago was aware of\r\nthere being two kinds of ostriches, he says, \"You must know, moreover,\r\nthat Emus differ in size and habits in different tracts of land; for\r\nthose that inhabit the plains of Buenos Ayres and Tucuman are larger,\r\nand have black, white and grey feathers; those near to the Strait of\r\nMagellan are smaller and more beautiful, for their white feathers are\r\ntipped with black at the extremity, and their black ones in like manner\r\nterminate in white.\"\r\n\r\nA very singular little bird, Tinochorus rumicivorus, is here common: in\r\nits habits and general appearance, it nearly equally partakes of the\r\ncharacters, different as they are, of the quail and snipe.  The\r\nTinochorus is found in the whole of southern South America, wherever\r\nthere are sterile plains, or open dry pasture land.  It frequents in\r\npairs or small flocks the most desolate places, where scarcely another\r\nliving creature can exist.  Upon being approached they squat close, and\r\nthen are very difficult to be distinguished from the ground.  When\r\nfeeding they walk rather slowly, with their legs wide apart.  They dust\r\nthemselves in roads and sandy places, and frequent particular spots,\r\nwhere they may be found day after day: like partridges, they take wing\r\nin a flock.  In all these respects, in the muscular gizzard adapted for\r\nvegetable food, in the arched beak and fleshy nostrils, short legs and\r\nform of foot, the Tinochorus has a close affinity with quails.  But as\r\nsoon as the bird is seen flying, its whole appearance changes; the long\r\npointed wings, so different from those in the gallinaceous order, the\r\nirregular manner of flight, and plaintive cry uttered at the moment of\r\nrising, recall the idea of a snipe.  The sportsmen of the Beagle\r\nunanimously called it the short-billed snipe.  To this genus, or rather\r\nto the family of the Waders, its skeleton shows that it is really\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\nThe Tinochorus is closely related to some other South American birds.\r\nTwo species of the genus Attagis are in almost every respect ptarmigans\r\nin their habits; one lives in Tierra del Fuego, above the limits of the\r\nforest land; and the other just beneath the snow-line on the Cordillera\r\nof Central Chile.  A bird of another closely allied genus, Chionis\r\nalba, is an inhabitant of the antarctic regions; it feeds on sea-weed\r\nand shells on the tidal rocks.  Although not web footed, from some\r\nunaccountable habit, it is frequently met with far out at sea.  This\r\nsmall family of birds is one of those which, from its varied relations\r\nto other families, although at present offering only difficulties to\r\nthe systematic naturalist, ultimately may assist in revealing the grand\r\nscheme, common to the present and past ages, on which organized beings\r\nhave been created.\r\n\r\nThe genus Furnarius contains several species, all small birds, living\r\non the ground, and inhabiting open dry countries. In structure they\r\ncannot be compared to any European form.  Ornithologists have generally\r\nincluded them among the creepers, although opposed to that family in\r\nevery habit.  The best known species is the common oven-bird of La\r\nPlata, the Casara or housemaker of the Spaniards.  The nest, whence it\r\ntakes its name, is placed in the most exposed situations, as on the top\r\nof a post, a bare rock, or on a cactus.  It is composed of mud and bits\r\nof straw, and has strong thick walls: in shape it precisely resembles\r\nan oven, or depressed beehive.  The opening is large and arched, and\r\ndirectly in front, within the nest, there is a partition, which reaches\r\nnearly to the roof, thus forming a passage or antechamber to the true\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nAnother and smaller species of Furnarius (F. cunicularius), resembles\r\nthe oven-bird in the general reddish tint of its plumage, in a peculiar\r\nshrill reiterated cry, and in an odd manner of running by starts.  From\r\nits affinity, the Spaniards call it Casarita (or little housebuilder),\r\nalthough its nidification is quite different.  The Casarita builds its\r\nnest at the bottom of a narrow cylindrical hole, which is said to\r\nextend horizontally to nearly six feet under ground. Several of the\r\ncountry people told me, that when boys, they had attempted to dig out\r\nthe nest, but had scarcely ever succeeded in getting to the end of the\r\npassage.  The bird chooses any low bank of firm sandy soil by the side\r\nof a road or stream.  Here (at Bahia Blanca) the walls round the houses\r\nare built of hardened mud, and I noticed that one, which enclosed a\r\ncourtyard where I lodged, was bored through by round holes in a score\r\nof places.  On asking the owner the cause of this he bitterly\r\ncomplained of the little casarita, several of which I afterwards\r\nobserved at work. It is rather curious to find how incapable these\r\nbirds must be of acquiring any notion of thickness, for although they\r\nwere constantly flitting over the low wall, they continued vainly to\r\nbore through it, thinking it an excellent bank for their nests.  I do\r\nnot doubt that each bird, as often as it came to daylight on the\r\nopposite side, was greatly surprised at the marvellous fact.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned nearly all the mammalia common in this\r\ncountry.  Of armadilloes three species occur namely, the Dasypus\r\nminutus or _pichy_, the D. villosus or _peludo_, and the _apar_.  The\r\nfirst extends ten degrees further south than any other kind; a fourth\r\nspecies, the _Mulita_, does not come as far south as Bahia Blanca.  The\r\nfour species have nearly similar habits; the _peludo_, however, is\r\nnocturnal, while the others wander by day over the open plains, feeding\r\non beetles, larvae, roots, and even small snakes.  The _apar_, commonly\r\ncalled _mataco_, is remarkable by having only three moveable bands; the\r\nrest of its tesselated covering being nearly inflexible.  It has the\r\npower of rolling itself into a perfect sphere, like one kind of English\r\nwoodlouse. In this state it is safe from the attack of dogs; for the\r\ndog not being able to take the whole in its mouth, tries to bite one\r\nside, and the ball slips away.  The smooth hard covering of the\r\n_mataco_ offers a better defence than the sharp spines of the hedgehog.\r\nThe _pichy_ prefers a very dry soil; and the sand-dunes near the coast,\r\nwhere for many months it can never taste water, is its favourite\r\nresort: it often tries to escape notice, by squatting close to the\r\nground.  In the course of a day's ride, near Bahia Blanca, several were\r\ngenerally met with.  The instant one was perceived, it was necessary,\r\nin order to catch it, almost to tumble off one's horse; for in soft\r\nsoil the animal burrowed so quickly, that its hinder quarters would\r\nalmost disappear before one could alight.  It seems almost a pity to\r\nkill such nice little animals, for as a Gaucho said, while sharpening\r\nhis knife on the back of one, \"Son tan mansos\" (they are so quiet).\r\n\r\nOf reptiles there are many kinds: one snake (a Trigonocephalus, or\r\nCophias [18]), from the size of the poison channel in its fangs, must\r\nbe very deadly.  Cuvier, in opposition to some other naturalists, makes\r\nthis a sub-genus of the rattlesnake, and intermediate between it and\r\nthe viper.  In confirmation of this opinion, I observed a fact, which\r\nappears to me very curious and instructive, as showing how every\r\ncharacter, even though it may be in some degree independent of\r\nstructure, has a tendency to vary by slow degrees. The extremity of the\r\ntail of this snake is terminated by a point, which is very slightly\r\nenlarged; and as the animal glides along, it constantly vibrates the\r\nlast inch; and this part striking against the dry grass and brushwood,\r\nproduces a rattling noise, which can be distinctly heard at the\r\ndistance of six feet.  As often as the animal was irritated or\r\nsurprised, its tail was shaken; and the vibrations were extremely\r\nrapid.  Even as long as the body retained its irritability, a tendency\r\nto this habitual movement was evident. This Trigonocephalus has,\r\ntherefore, in some respects the structure of a viper, with the habits\r\nof a rattlesnake: the noise, however, being produced by a simpler\r\ndevice.  The expression of this snake's face was hideous and fierce;\r\nthe pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris;\r\nthe jaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a\r\ntriangular projection.  I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly,\r\nexcepting, perhaps, some of the vampire bats.  I imagine this repulsive\r\naspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with\r\nrespect to each other, somewhat proportional to those of the human\r\nface; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Batrachian reptiles, I found only one little toad\r\n(Phryniscus nigricans), which was most singular from its colour.  If we\r\nimagine, first, that it had been steeped in the blackest ink, and then,\r\nwhen dry, allowed to crawl over a board, freshly painted with the\r\nbrightest vermilion, so as to colour the soles of its feet and parts of\r\nits stomach, a good idea of its appearance will be gained.  If it had\r\nbeen an unnamed species, surely it ought to have been called\r\n_Diabolicus_, for it is a fit toad to preach in the ear of Eve. Instead\r\nof being nocturnal in its habits, as other toads are, and living in\r\ndamp obscure recesses, it crawls during the heat of the day about the\r\ndry sand-hillocks and arid plains, where not a single drop of water can\r\nbe found.  It must necessarily depend on the dew for its moisture; and\r\nthis probably is absorbed by the skin, for it is known, that these\r\nreptiles possess great powers of cutaneous absorption.  At Maldonado, I\r\nfound one in a situation nearly as dry as at Bahia Blanca, and thinking\r\nto give it a great treat, carried it to a pool of water; not only was\r\nthe little animal unable to swim, but I think without help it would\r\nsoon have been drowned. Of lizards there were many kinds, but only one\r\n(Proctotretus multimaculatus) remarkable from its habits.  It lives on\r\nthe bare sand near the sea coast, and from its mottled colour, the\r\nbrownish scales being speckled with white, yellowish red, and dirty\r\nblue, can hardly be distinguished from the surrounding surface.  When\r\nfrightened, it attempts to avoid discovery by feigning death, with\r\noutstretched legs, depressed body, and closed eyes: if further\r\nmolested, it buries itself with great quickness in the loose sand. This\r\nlizard, from its flattened body and short legs, cannot run quickly.\r\n\r\nI will here add a few remarks on the hybernation of animals in this\r\npart of South America.  When we first arrived at Bahia Blanca,\r\nSeptember 7th, 1832, we thought nature had granted scarcely a living\r\ncreature to this sandy and dry country.  By digging, however, in the\r\nground, several insects, large spiders, and lizards were found in a\r\nhalf-torpid state.  On the 15th, a few animals began to appear, and by\r\nthe 18th (three days from the equinox), everything announced the\r\ncommencement of spring.  The plains were ornamented by the flowers of a\r\npink wood-sorrel, wild peas, cenotherae, and geraniums; and the birds\r\nbegan to lay their eggs.  Numerous Lamellicorn and Heteromerous\r\ninsects, the latter remarkable for their deeply sculptured bodies, were\r\nslowly crawling about; while the lizard tribe, the constant inhabitants\r\nof a sandy soil, darted about in every direction. During the first\r\neleven days, whilst nature was dormant, the mean temperature taken from\r\nobservations made every two hours on board the Beagle, was 51 degs.;\r\nand in the middle of the day the thermometer seldom ranged above 55\r\ndegs.  On the eleven succeeding days, in which all living things became\r\nso animated, the mean was 58 degs., and the range in the middle of the\r\nday between 60 and 70 degs.  Here, then, an increase of seven degrees\r\nin mean temperature, but a greater one of extreme heat, was sufficient\r\nto awake the functions of life. At Monte Video, from which we had just\r\nbefore sailed, in the twenty-three days included between the 26th of\r\nJuly and the 19th of August, the mean temperature from 276 observations\r\nwas 58.4 degs.; the mean hottest day being 65.5 degs., and the coldest\r\n46 degs.  The lowest point to which the thermometer fell was 41.5\r\ndegs., and occasionally in the middle of the day it rose to 69 or 70\r\ndegs. Yet with this high temperature, almost every beetle, several\r\ngenera of spiders, snails, and land-shells, toads and lizards were all\r\nlying torpid beneath stones.  But we have seen that at Bahia Blanca,\r\nwhich is four degrees southward and therefore with a climate only a\r\nvery little colder, this same temperature with a rather less extreme\r\nheat, was sufficient to awake all orders of animated beings. This shows\r\nhow nicely the stimulus required to arouse hybernating animals is\r\ngoverned by the usual climate of the district, and not by the absolute\r\nheat.  It is well known that within the tropics, the hybernation, or\r\nmore properly aestivation, of animals is determined not by the\r\ntemperature, but by the times of drought.  Near Rio de Janeiro, I was\r\nat first surprised to observe, that, a few days after some little\r\ndepressions had been filled with water, they were peopled by numerous\r\nfull-grown shells and beetles, which must have been lying dormant.\r\nHumboldt has related the strange accident of a hovel having been\r\nerected over a spot where a young crocodile lay buried in the hardened\r\nmud.  He adds, \"The Indians often find enormous boas, which they call\r\nUji or water serpents, in the same lethargic state.  To reanimate them,\r\nthey must be irritated or wetted with water.\"\r\n\r\nI will only mention one other animal, a zoophyte (I believe Virgularia\r\nPatagonica), a kind of sea-pen.  It consists of a thin, straight,\r\nfleshy stem, with alternate rows of polypi on each side, and\r\nsurrounding an elastic stony axis, varying in length from eight inches\r\nto two feet.  The stem at one extremity is truncate, but at the other\r\nis terminated by a vermiform fleshy appendage.  The stony axis which\r\ngives strength to the stem may be traced at this extremity into a mere\r\nvessel filled with granular matter.  At low water hundreds of these\r\nzoophytes might be seen, projecting like stubble, with the truncate end\r\nupwards, a few inches above the surface of the muddy sand.  When\r\ntouched or pulled they suddenly drew themselves in with force, so as\r\nnearly or quite to disappear.  By this action, the highly elastic axis\r\nmust be bent at the lower extremity, where it is naturally slightly\r\ncurved; and I imagine it is by this elasticity alone that the zoophyte\r\nis enabled to rise again through the mud.  Each polypus, though closely\r\nunited to its brethren, has a distinct mouth, body, and tentacula.  Of\r\nthese polypi, in a large specimen, there must be many thousands; yet we\r\nsee that they act by one movement: they have also one central axis\r\nconnected with a system of obscure circulation, and the ova are\r\nproduced in an organ distinct from the separate individuals. [19] Well\r\nmay one be allowed to ask, what is an individual?  It is always\r\ninteresting to discover the foundation of the strange tales of the old\r\nvoyagers; and I have no doubt but that the habits of this Virgularia\r\nexplain one such case. Captain Lancaster, in his voyage [20] in 1601,\r\nnarrates that on the sea-sands of the Island of Sombrero, in the East\r\nIndies, he \"found a small twig growing up like a young tree, and on\r\noffering to pluck it up it shrinks down to the ground, and sinks,\r\nunless held very hard.  On being plucked up, a great worm is found to\r\nbe its root, and as the tree groweth in greatness, so doth the worm\r\ndiminish, and as soon as the worm is entirely turned into a tree it\r\nrooteth in the earth, and so becomes great.  This transformation is one\r\nof the strangest wonders that I saw in all my travels: for if this tree\r\nis plucked up, while young, and the leaves and bark stripped off, it\r\nbecomes a hard stone when dry, much like white coral: thus is this worm\r\ntwice transformed into different natures.  Of these we gathered and\r\nbrought home many.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring my stay at Bahia Blanca, while waiting for the Beagle, the place\r\nwas in a constant state of excitement, from rumours of wars and\r\nvictories, between the troops of Rosas and the wild Indians.  One day\r\nan account came that a small party forming one of the postas on the\r\nline to Buenos Ayres, had been found all murdered.  The next day three\r\nhundred men arrived from the Colorado, under the command of Commandant\r\nMiranda.  A large portion of these men were Indians (mansos, or tame),\r\nbelonging to the tribe of the Cacique Bernantio.  They passed the night\r\nhere; and it was impossible to conceive anything more wild and savage\r\nthan the scene of their bivouac.  Some drank till they were\r\nintoxicated; others swallowed the steaming blood of the cattle\r\nslaughtered for their suppers, and then, being sick from drunkenness,\r\nthey cast it up again, and were besmeared with filth and gore.\r\n\r\nNam simul expletus dapibus, vinoque sepultus Cervicem inflexam posuit,\r\njacuitque per antrum Immensus, saniem eructans, ac frusta cruenta Per\r\nsomnum commixta mero.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they started for the scene of the murder, with orders to\r\nfollow the \"rastro,\" or track, even if it led them to Chile.  We\r\nsubsequently heard that the wild Indians had escaped into the great\r\nPampas, and from some cause the track had been missed.  One glance at\r\nthe rastro tells these people a whole history.  Supposing they examine\r\nthe track of a thousand horses, they will soon guess the number of\r\nmounted ones by seeing how many have cantered; by the depth of the\r\nother impressions, whether any horses were loaded with cargoes; by the\r\nirregularity of the footsteps, how far tired; by the manner in which\r\nthe food has been cooked, whether the pursued travelled in haste; by\r\nthe general appearance, how long it has been since they passed. They\r\nconsider a rastro of ten days or a fortnight, quite recent enough to be\r\nhunted out.  We also heard that Miranda struck from the west end of the\r\nSierra Ventana, in a direct line to the island of Cholechel, situated\r\nseventy leagues up the Rio Negro.  This is a distance of between two\r\nand three hundred miles, through a country completely unknown. What\r\nother troops in the world are so independent?  With the sun for their\r\nguide, mare's flesh for food, their saddle-cloths for beds,--as long as\r\nthere is a little water, these men would penetrate to the end of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I saw another troop of these banditti-like\r\nsoldiers start on an expedition against a tribe of Indians at the small\r\nSalinas, who had been betrayed by a prisoner cacique.  The Spaniard who\r\nbrought the orders for this expedition was a very intelligent man.  He\r\ngave me an account of the last engagement at which he was present. Some\r\nIndians, who had been taken prisoners, gave information of a tribe\r\nliving north of the Colorado.  Two hundred soldiers were sent; and they\r\nfirst discovered the Indians by a cloud of dust from their horses'\r\nfeet, as they chanced to be travelling.  The country was mountainous\r\nand wild, and it must have been far in the interior, for the Cordillera\r\nwere in sight.  The Indians, men, women, and children, were about one\r\nhundred and ten in number, and they were nearly all taken or killed,\r\nfor the soldiers sabre every man.  The Indians are now so terrified\r\nthat they offer no resistance in a body, but each flies, neglecting\r\neven his wife and children; but when overtaken, like wild animals, they\r\nfight against any number to the last moment.  One dying Indian seized\r\nwith his teeth the thumb of his adversary, and allowed his own eye to\r\nbe forced out sooner than relinquish his hold.  Another, who was\r\nwounded, feigned death, keeping a knife ready to strike one more fatal\r\nblow.  My informer said, when he was pursuing an Indian, the man cried\r\nout for mercy, at the same time that he was covertly loosing the bolas\r\nfrom his waist, meaning to whirl it round his head and so strike his\r\npursuer.  \"I however struck him with my sabre to the ground, and then\r\ngot off my horse, and cut his throat with my knife.\" This is a dark\r\npicture; but how much more shocking is the unquestionable fact, that\r\nall the women who appear above twenty years old are massacred in cold\r\nblood! When I exclaimed that this appeared rather inhuman, he answered,\r\n\"Why, what can be done? they breed so!\"\r\n\r\nEvery one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war,\r\nbecause it is against barbarians.  Who would believe in this age that\r\nsuch atrocities could be committed in a Christian civilized country?\r\nThe children of the Indians are saved, to be sold or given away as\r\nservants, or rather slaves for as long a time as the owners can make\r\nthem believe themselves slaves; but I believe in their treatment there\r\nis little to complain of.\r\n\r\nIn the battle four men ran away together.  They were pursued, one was\r\nkilled, and the other three were taken alive. They turned out to be\r\nmessengers or ambassadors from a large body of Indians, united in the\r\ncommon cause of defence, near the Cordillera.  The tribe to which they\r\nhad been sent was on the point of holding a grand council, the feast of\r\nmare's flesh was ready, and the dance prepared: in the morning the\r\nambassadors were to have returned to the Cordillera.  They were\r\nremarkably fine men, very fair, above six feet high, and all under\r\nthirty years of age.  The three survivors of course possessed very\r\nvaluable information and to extort this they were placed in a line. The\r\ntwo first being questioned, answered, \"No se\" (I do not know), and were\r\none after the other shot.  The third also said \"No se;\" adding, \"Fire,\r\nI am a man, and can die!\" Not one syllable would they breathe to injure\r\nthe united cause of their country! The conduct of the above-mentioned\r\ncacique was very different; he saved his life by betraying the intended\r\nplan of warfare, and the point of union in the Andes.  It was believed\r\nthat there were already six or seven hundred Indians together, and that\r\nin summer their numbers would be doubled. Ambassadors were to have been\r\nsent to the Indians at the small Salinas, near Bahia Blanca, whom I\r\nhave mentioned that this same cacique had betrayed.  The communication,\r\ntherefore, between the Indians, extends from the Cordillera to the\r\ncoast of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nGeneral Rosas's plan is to kill all stragglers, and having driven the\r\nremainder to a common point, to attack them in a body, in the summer,\r\nwith the assistance of the Chilenos. This operation is to be repeated\r\nfor three successive years. I imagine the summer is chosen as the time\r\nfor the main attack, because the plains are then without water, and the\r\nIndians can only travel in particular directions.  The escape of the\r\nIndians to the south of the Rio Negro, where in such a vast unknown\r\ncountry they would be safe, is prevented by a treaty with the\r\nTehuelches to this effect;--that Rosas pays them so much to slaughter\r\nevery Indian who passes to the south of the river, but if they fail in\r\nso doing, they themselves are to be exterminated.  The war is waged\r\nchiefly against the Indians near the Cordillera; for many of the tribes\r\non this eastern side are fighting with Rosas.  The general, however,\r\nlike Lord Chesterfield, thinking that his friends may in a future day\r\nbecome his enemies, always places them in the front ranks, so that\r\ntheir numbers may be thinned.  Since leaving South America we have\r\nheard that this war of extermination completely failed.\r\n\r\nAmong the captive girls taken in the same engagement, there were two\r\nvery pretty Spanish ones, who had been carried away by the Indians when\r\nyoung, and could now only speak the Indian tongue.  From their account\r\nthey must have come from Salta, a distance in a straight line of nearly\r\none thousand miles.  This gives one a grand idea of the immense\r\nterritory over which the Indians roam: yet, great as it is, I think\r\nthere will not, in another half-century, be a wild Indian northward of\r\nthe Rio Negro.  The warfare is too bloody to last; the Christians\r\nkilling every Indian, and the Indians doing the same by the Christians.\r\nIt is melancholy to trace how the Indians have given way before the\r\nSpanish invaders.  Schirdel [21] says that in 1535, when Buenos Ayres\r\nwas founded, there were villages containing two and three thousand\r\ninhabitants.  Even in Falconer's time (1750) the Indians made inroads\r\nas far as Luxan, Areco, and Arrecife, but now they are driven beyond\r\nthe Salado.  Not only have whole tribes been exterminated, but the\r\nremaining Indians have become more barbarous: instead of living in\r\nlarge villages, and being employed in the arts of fishing, as well as\r\nof the chase, they now wander about the open plains, without home or\r\nfixed occupation.\r\n\r\nI heard also some account of an engagement which took place, a few\r\nweeks previously to the one mentioned, at Cholechel.  This is a very\r\nimportant station on account of being a pass for horses; and it was, in\r\nconsequence, for some time the head-quarters of a division of the army.\r\nWhen the troops first arrived there they found a tribe of Indians, of\r\nwhom they killed twenty or thirty.  The cacique escaped in a manner\r\nwhich astonished every one.  The chief Indians always have one or two\r\npicked horses, which they keep ready for any urgent occasion.  On one\r\nof these, an old white horse, the cacique sprung, taking with him his\r\nlittle son.  The horse had neither saddle nor bridle.  To avoid the\r\nshots, the Indian rode in the peculiar method of his nation namely,\r\nwith an arm round the horse's neck, and one leg only on its back.  Thus\r\nhanging on one side, he was seen patting the horse's head, and talking\r\nto him.  The pursuers urged every effort in the chase; the Commandant\r\nthree times changed his horse, but all in vain.  The old Indian father\r\nand his son escaped, and were free.  What a fine picture one can form\r\nin one's mind,--the naked, bronze-like figure of the old man with his\r\nlittle boy, riding like a Mazeppa on the white horse, thus leaving far\r\nbehind him the host of his pursuers!\r\n\r\nI saw one day a soldier striking fire with a piece of flint, which I\r\nimmediately recognised as having been a part of the head of an arrow.\r\nHe told me it was found near the island of Cholechel, and that they are\r\nfrequently picked up there. It was between two and three inches long,\r\nand therefore twice as large as those now used in Tierra del Fuego: it\r\nwas made of opaque cream-coloured flint, but the point and barbs had\r\nbeen intentionally broken off.  It is well known that no Pampas Indians\r\nnow use bows and arrows.  I believe a small tribe in Banda Oriental\r\nmust be excepted; but they are widely separated from the Pampas\r\nIndians, and border close on those tribes that inhabit the forest, and\r\nlive on foot.  It appears, therefore, that these arrow-heads are\r\nantiquarian [22] relics of the Indians, before the great change in\r\nhabits consequent on the introduction of the horse into South America.\r\n\r\n[1] Since this was written, M. Alcide d'Orbingy has examined these\r\nshells, and pronounces them all to be recent.\r\n\r\n[2] M. Aug. Bravard has described, in a Spanish work ('Observaciones\r\nGeologicas,' 1857), this district, and he believes that the bones of\r\nthe extinct mammals were washed out of the underlying Pampean deposit,\r\nand subsequently became embedded with the still existing shells; but I\r\nam not convinced by his remarks.  M. Bravard believes that the whole\r\nenormous Pampean deposit is a sub-aerial formation, like sand-dunes:\r\nthis seems to me to be an untenable doctrine.\r\n\r\n[3] Principles of Geology, vol. iv. p. 40.\r\n\r\n[4] This theory was first developed in the Zoology of the Voyage of the\r\nBeagle, and subsequently in Professor Owen's Memoir on Mylodon robustus.\r\n\r\n[5] I mean this to exclude the total amount which may have been\r\nsuccessively produced and consumed during a given period.\r\n\r\n[6] Travels in the Interior of South Africa, vol. ii. p. 207\r\n\r\n[7] The elephant which was killed at Exeter Change was estimated (being\r\npartly weighed) at five tons and a half. The elephant actress, as I was\r\ninformed, weighed one ton less; so that we may take five as the average\r\nof a full-grown elephant.  I was told at the Surry Gardens, that a\r\nhippopotamus which was sent to England cut up into pieces was estimated\r\nat three tons and a half; we will call it three.  From these premises\r\nwe may give three tons and a half to each of the five rhinoceroses;\r\nperhaps a ton to the giraffe, and half to the bos caffer as well as to\r\nthe elan (a large ox weighs from 1200 to 1500 pounds).  This will give\r\nan average (from the above estimates) of 2.7 of a ton for the ten\r\nlargest herbivorous animals of Southern Africa.  In South America,\r\nallowing 1200 pounds for the two tapirs together, 550 for the guanaco\r\nand vicuna, 500 for three deer, 300 for the capybara, peccari, and a\r\nmonkey, we shall have an average of 250 pounds, which I believe is\r\noverstating the result.  The ratio will therefore be as 6048 to 250, or\r\n24 to 1, for the ten largest animals from the two continents.\r\n\r\n[8] If we suppose the case of the discovery of a skeleton of a\r\nGreenland whale in a fossil state, not a single cetaceous animal being\r\nknown to exist, what naturalist would have ventured conjecture on the\r\npossibility of a carcass so gigantic being supported on the minute\r\ncrustacea and mollusca living in the frozen seas of the extreme North?\r\n\r\n[9] See Zoological Remarks to Capt. Back's Expedition, by Dr.\r\nRichardson.  He says, \"The subsoil north of latitude 56 degs. is\r\nperpetually frozen, the thaw on the coast not penetrating above three\r\nfeet, and at Bear Lake, in latitude 64 degs., not more than twenty\r\ninches.  The frozen substratum does not of itself destroy vegetation,\r\nfor forests flourish on the surface, at a distance from the coast.\"\r\n\r\n[10] See Humboldt, Fragments Asiatiques, p. 386: Barton's Geography of\r\nPlants: and Malte Brun.  In the latter work it is said that the limit\r\nof the growth of trees in Siberia may be drawn under the parallel of 70\r\ndegs.\r\n\r\n[11] Sturt's Travels, vol. ii. p. 74.\r\n\r\n[12] A Gaucho assured me that he had once seen a snow-white or Albino\r\nvariety, and that it was a most beautiful bird.\r\n\r\n[13] Burchell's Travels, vol. i. p. 280.\r\n\r\n[14] Azara, vol. iv. p. 173.\r\n\r\n[15] Lichtenstein, however, asserts (Travels, vol. ii. p. 25) that the\r\nhens begin sitting when they have laid ten or twelve eggs; and that\r\nthey continue laying, I presume, in another nest.  This appears to me\r\nvery improbable.  He asserts that four or five hens associate for\r\nincubation with one cock, who sits only at night.\r\n\r\n[16] When at the Rio Negro, we heard much of the indefatigable labours\r\nof this naturalist.  M. Alcide d'Orbigny, during the years 1825 to\r\n1833, traversed several large portions of South America, and has made a\r\ncollection, and is now publishing the results on a scale of\r\nmagnificence, which at once places himself in the list of American\r\ntravellers second only to Humboldt.\r\n\r\n[17] Account of the Abipones, A.D. 1749, vol. i. (English Translation)\r\np. 314\r\n\r\n[18] M. Bibron calls it T. crepitans.\r\n\r\n\r\n[19] The cavities leading from the fleshy compartments of the\r\nextremity, were filled with a yellow pulpy matter, which, examined\r\nunder a microscope, presented an extraordinary appearance.  The mass\r\nconsisted of rounded, semi-transparent, irregular grains, aggregated\r\ntogether into particles of various sizes.  All such particles, and the\r\nseparate grains, possessed the power of rapid movement; generally\r\nrevolving around different axes, but sometimes progressive.  The\r\nmovement was visible with a very weak power, but even with the highest\r\nits cause could not be perceived.  It was very different from the\r\ncirculation of the fluid in the elastic bag, containing the thin\r\nextremity of the axis.  On other occasions, when dissecting small\r\nmarine animals beneath the microscope, I have seen particles of pulpy\r\nmatter, some of large size, as soon as they were disengaged, commence\r\nrevolving.  I have imagined, I know not with how much truth, that this\r\ngranulo-pulpy matter was in process of being converted into ova.\r\nCertainly in this zoophyte such appeared to be the case.\r\n\r\n[20] Kerr's Collection of Voyages, vol. viii. p. 119.\r\n\r\n[21] Purchas's Collection of Voyages.  I believe the date was really\r\n1537.\r\n\r\n[22] Azara has even doubted whether the Pampas Indians ever used bows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBAHIA BLANCA TO BUENOS AYRES\r\n\r\nSet out for Buenos Ayres--Rio Sauce--Sierra Ventana--Third\r\nPosta--Driving Horses--Bolas--Partridges and Foxes--Features of the\r\nCountry--Long-legged Plover--Teru-tero--Hail-storm--Natural Enclosures\r\nin the Sierra Tapalguen--Flesh of Puma--Meat Diet--Guardia del\r\nMonte--Effects of Cattle on the Vegetation--Cardoon--Buenos\r\nAyres--Corral where Cattle are Slaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER 18th.--I hired a Gaucho to accompany me on my ride to Buenos\r\nAyres, though with some difficulty, as the father of one man was afraid\r\nto let him go, and another, who seemed willing, was described to me as\r\nso fearful, that I was afraid to take him, for I was told that even if\r\nhe saw an ostrich at a distance, he would mistake it for an Indian, and\r\nwould fly like the wind away. The distance to Buenos Ayres is about\r\nfour hundred miles, and nearly the whole way through an uninhabited\r\ncountry. We started early in the morning; ascending a few hundred feet\r\nfrom the basin of green turf on which Bahia Blanca stands, we entered\r\non a wide desolate plain.  It consists of a crumbling\r\nargillaceo-calcareous rock, which, from the dry nature of the climate,\r\nsupports only scattered tufts of withered grass, without a single bush\r\nor tree to break the monotonous uniformity.  The weather was fine, but\r\nthe atmosphere remarkably hazy; I thought the appearance foreboded a\r\ngale, but the Gauchos said it was owing to the plain, at some great\r\ndistance in the interior, being on fire.  After a long gallop, having\r\nchanged horses twice, we reached the Rio Sauce: it is a deep, rapid,\r\nlittle stream, not above twenty-five feet wide.  The second posta on\r\nthe road to Buenos Ayres stands on its banks, a little above there is a\r\nford for horses, where the water does not reach to the horses' belly;\r\nbut from that point, in its course to the sea, it is quite impassable,\r\nand hence makes a most useful barrier against the Indians.\r\n\r\nInsignificant as this stream is, the Jesuit Falconer, whose information\r\nis generally so very correct, figures it as a considerable river,\r\nrising at the foot of the Cordillera.  With respect to its source, I do\r\nnot doubt that this is the case for the Gauchos assured me, that in the\r\nmiddle of the dry summer, this stream, at the same time with the\r\nColorado has periodical floods; which can only originate in the snow\r\nmelting on the Andes.  It is extremely improbable that a stream so\r\nsmall as the Sauce then was, should traverse the entire width of the\r\ncontinent; and indeed, if it were the residue of a large river, its\r\nwaters, as in other ascertained cases, would be saline.  During the\r\nwinter we must look to the springs round the Sierra Ventana as the\r\nsource of its pure and limpid stream.  I suspect the plains of\r\nPatagonia like those of Australia, are traversed by many water-courses\r\nwhich only perform their proper parts at certain periods. Probably this\r\nis the case with the water which flows into the head of Port Desire,\r\nand likewise with the Rio Chupat, on the banks of which masses of\r\nhighly cellular scoriae were found by the officers employed in the\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nAs it was early in the afternoon when we arrived, we took fresh horses,\r\nand a soldier for a guide, and started for the Sierra de la Ventana.\r\nThis mountain is visible from the anchorage at Bahia Blanca; and Capt.\r\nFitz Roy calculates its height to be 3340 feet--an altitude very\r\nremarkable on this eastern side of the continent.  I am not aware that\r\nany foreigner, previous to my visit, had ascended this mountain; and\r\nindeed very few of the soldiers at Bahia Blanca knew anything about it.\r\nHence we heard of beds of coal, of gold and silver, of caves, and of\r\nforests, all of which inflamed my curiosity, only to disappoint it. The\r\ndistance from the posta was about six leagues over a level plain of the\r\nsame character as before.  The ride was, however, interesting, as the\r\nmountain began to show its true form.  When we reached the foot of the\r\nmain ridge, we had much difficulty in finding any water, and we thought\r\nwe should have been obliged to have passed the night without any.  At\r\nlast we discovered some by looking close to the mountain, for at the\r\ndistance even of a few hundred yards the streamlets were buried and\r\nentirely lost in the friable calcareous stone and loose detritus. I do\r\nnot think Nature ever made a more solitary, desolate pile of rock;--it\r\nwell deserves its name of _Hurtado_, or separated.  The mountain is\r\nsteep, extremely rugged, and broken, and so entirely destitute of\r\ntrees, and even bushes, that we actually could not make a skewer to\r\nstretch out our meat over the fire of thistle-stalks. [1] The strange\r\naspect of this mountain is contrasted by the sea-like plain, which not\r\nonly abuts against its steep sides, but likewise separates the parallel\r\nranges.  The uniformity of the colouring gives an extreme quietness to\r\nthe view,--the whitish grey of the quartz rock, and the light brown of\r\nthe withered grass of the plain, being unrelieved by any brighter tint.\r\nFrom custom, one expects to see in the neighbourhood of a lofty and\r\nbold mountain, a broken country strewed over with huge fragments. Here\r\nnature shows that the last movement before the bed of the sea is\r\nchanged into dry land may sometimes be one of tranquillity. Under these\r\ncircumstances I was curious to observe how far from the parent rock any\r\npebbles could be found.  On the shores of Bahia Blanca, and near the\r\nsettlement, there were some of quartz, which certainly must have come\r\nfrom this source: the distance is forty-five miles.\r\n\r\nThe dew, which in the early part of the night wetted the saddle-cloths\r\nunder which we slept, was in the morning frozen.  The plain, though\r\nappearing horizontal, had insensibly sloped up to a height of between\r\n800 and 900 feet above the sea.  In the morning (9th of September) the\r\nguide told me to ascend the nearest ridge, which he thought would lead\r\nme to the four peaks that crown the summit.  The climbing up such rough\r\nrocks was very fatiguing; the sides were so indented, that what was\r\ngained in one five minutes was often lost in the next.  At last, when I\r\nreached the ridge, my disappointment was extreme in finding a\r\nprecipitous valley as deep as the plain, which cut the chain\r\ntransversely in two, and separated me from the four points.  This\r\nvalley is very narrow, but flat-bottomed, and it forms a fine\r\nhorse-pass for the Indians, as it connects the plains on the northern\r\nand southern sides of the range.  Having descended, and while crossing\r\nit, I saw two horses grazing: I immediately hid myself in the long\r\ngrass, and began to reconnoitre; but as I could see no signs of Indians\r\nI proceeded cautiously on my second ascent.  It was late in the day,\r\nand this part of the mountain, like the other, was steep and rugged.  I\r\nwas on the top of the second peak by two o'clock, but got there with\r\nextreme difficulty; every twenty yards I had the cramp in the upper\r\npart of both thighs, so that I was afraid I should not have been able\r\nto have got down again.  It was also necessary to return by another\r\nroad, as it was out of the question to pass over the saddle-back.  I\r\nwas therefore obliged to give up the two higher peaks.  Their altitude\r\nwas but little greater, and every purpose of geology had been answered;\r\nso that the attempt was not worth the hazard of any further exertion. I\r\npresume the cause of the cramp was the great change in the kind of\r\nmuscular action, from that of hard riding to that of still harder\r\nclimbing.  It is a lesson worth remembering, as in some cases it might\r\ncause much difficulty.\r\n\r\nI have already said the mountain is composed of white quartz rock, and\r\nwith it a little glossy clay-slate is associated.  At the height of a\r\nfew hundred feet above the plain patches of conglomerate adhered in\r\nseveral places to the solid rock.  They resembled in hardness, and in\r\nthe nature of the cement, the masses which may be seen daily forming on\r\nsome coasts.  I do not doubt these pebbles were in a similar manner\r\naggregated, at a period when the great calcareous formation was\r\ndepositing beneath the surrounding sea. We may believe that the jagged\r\nand battered forms of the hard quartz yet show the effects of the waves\r\nof an open ocean.\r\n\r\nI was, on the whole, disappointed with this ascent.  Even the view was\r\ninsignificant;--a plain like the sea, but without its beautiful colour\r\nand defined outline.  The scene, however, was novel, and a little\r\ndanger, like salt to meat, gave it a relish.  That the danger was very\r\nlittle was certain, for my two companions made a good fire--a thing\r\nwhich is never done when it is suspected that Indians are near. I\r\nreached the place of our bivouac by sunset, and drinking much mate, and\r\nsmoking several cigaritos, soon made up my bed for the night.  The wind\r\nwas very strong and cold, but I never slept more comfortably.\r\n\r\nSeptember 10th.--In the morning, having fairly scudded before the gale,\r\nwe arrived by the middle of the day at the Sauce posta.  In the road we\r\nsaw great numbers of deer, and near the mountain a guanaco. The plain,\r\nwhich abuts against the Sierra, is traversed by some curious gullies,\r\nof which one was about twenty feet wide, and at least thirty deep; we\r\nwere obliged in consequence to make a considerable circuit before we\r\ncould find a pass.  We stayed the night at the posta, the conversation,\r\nas was generally the case, being about the Indians.  The Sierra Ventana\r\nwas formerly a great place of resort; and three or four years ago there\r\nwas much fighting there.  My guide had been present when many Indians\r\nwere killed: the women escaped to the top of the ridge, and fought most\r\ndesperately with great stones; many thus saving themselves.\r\n\r\nSeptember 11th.--Proceeded to the third posta in company with the\r\nlieutenant who commanded it.  The distance is called fifteen leagues;\r\nbut it is only guess-work, and is generally overstated.  The road was\r\nuninteresting, over a dry grassy plain; and on our left hand at a\r\ngreater or less distance there were some low hills; a continuation of\r\nwhich we crossed close to the posta.  Before our arrival we met a large\r\nherd of cattle and horses, guarded by fifteen soldiers; but we were\r\ntold many had been lost.  It is very difficult to drive animals across\r\nthe plains; for if in the night a puma, or even a fox, approaches,\r\nnothing can prevent the horses dispersing in every direction; and a\r\nstorm will have the same effect.  A short time since, an officer left\r\nBuenos Ayres with five hundred horses, and when he arrived at the army\r\nhe had under twenty.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards we perceived by the cloud of dust, that a party of\r\nhorsemen were coming towards us; when far distant my companions knew\r\nthem to be Indians, by their long hair streaming behind their backs.\r\nThe Indians generally have a fillet round their heads, but never any\r\ncovering; and their black hair blowing across their swarthy faces,\r\nheightens to an uncommon degree the wildness of their appearance. They\r\nturned out to be a party of Bernantio's friendly tribe, going to a\r\nsalina for salt.  The Indians eat much salt, their children sucking it\r\nlike sugar.  This habit is very different from that of the Spanish\r\nGauchos, who, leading the same kind of life, eat scarcely any;\r\naccording to Mungo Park, [2] it is people who live on vegetable food\r\nwho have an unconquerable desire for salt.  The Indians gave us\r\ngood-humoured nods as they passed at full gallop, driving before them a\r\ntroop of horses, and followed by a train of lanky dogs.\r\n\r\nSeptember 12th and 13th.--I stayed at this posta two days, waiting for\r\na troop of soldiers, which General Rosas had the kindness to send to\r\ninform me, would shortly travel to Buenos Ayres; and he advised me to\r\ntake the opportunity of the escort.  In the morning we rode to some\r\nneighbouring hills to view the country, and to examine the geology.\r\nAfter dinner the soldiers divided themselves into two parties for a\r\ntrial of skill with the bolas.  Two spears were stuck in the ground\r\ntwenty-five yards apart, but they were struck and entangled only once\r\nin four or five times.  The balls can be thrown fifty or sixty yards,\r\nbut with little certainty. This, however, does not apply to a man on\r\nhorseback; for when the speed of the horse is added to the force of the\r\narm, it is said, that they can be whirled with effect to the distance\r\nof eighty yards.  As a proof of their force, I may mention, that at the\r\nFalkland Islands, when the Spaniards murdered some of their own\r\ncountrymen and all the Englishmen, a young friendly Spaniard was\r\nrunning away, when a great tall man, by name Luciano, came at full\r\ngallop after him, shouting to him to stop, and saying that he only\r\nwanted to speak to him.  Just as the Spaniard was on the point of\r\nreaching the boat, Luciano threw the balls: they struck him on the legs\r\nwith such a jerk, as to throw him down and to render him for some time\r\ninsensible.  The man, after Luciano had had his talk, was allowed to\r\nescape.  He told us that his legs were marked by great weals, where the\r\nthong had wound round, as if he had been flogged with a whip. In the\r\nmiddle of the day two men arrived, who brought a parcel from the next\r\nposta to be forwarded to the general: so that besides these two, our\r\nparty consisted this evening of my guide and self, the lieutenant, and\r\nhis four soldiers. The latter were strange beings; the first a fine\r\nyoung negro; the second half Indian and negro; and the two others\r\nnon-descripts; namely, an old Chilian miner, the colour of mahogany,\r\nand another partly a mulatto; but two such mongrels with such\r\ndetestable expressions, I never saw before. At night, when they were\r\nsitting round the fire, and playing at cards, I retired to view such a\r\nSalvator Rosa scene.  They were seated under a low cliff, so that I\r\ncould look down upon them; around the party were lying dogs, arms,\r\nremnants of deer and ostriches; and their long spears were stuck in the\r\nturf.  Further in the dark background, their horses were tied up, ready\r\nfor any sudden danger.  If the stillness of the desolate plain was\r\nbroken by one of the dogs barking, a soldier, leaving the fire, would\r\nplace his head close to the ground, and thus slowly scan the horizon.\r\nEven if the noisy teru-tero uttered its scream, there would be a pause\r\nin the conversation, and every head, for a moment, a little inclined.\r\n\r\nWhat a life of misery these men appear to us to lead! They were at\r\nleast ten leagues from the Sauce posta, and since the murder committed\r\nby the Indians, twenty from another.  The Indians are supposed to have\r\nmade their attack in the middle of the night; for very early in the\r\nmorning after the murder, they were luckily seen approaching this\r\nposta.  The whole party here, however, escaped, together with the troop\r\nof horses; each one taking a line for himself, and driving with him as\r\nmany animals as he was able to manage.\r\n\r\nThe little hovel, built of thistle-stalks, in which they slept, neither\r\nkept out the wind nor rain; indeed in the latter case the only effect\r\nthe roof had, was to condense it into larger drops.  They had nothing\r\nto eat excepting what they could catch, such as ostriches, deer,\r\narmadilloes, etc., and their only fuel was the dry stalks of a small\r\nplant, somewhat resembling an aloe.  The sole luxury which these men\r\nenjoyed was smoking the little paper cigars, and sucking mate.  I used\r\nto think that the carrion vultures, man's constant attendants on these\r\ndreary plains, while seated on the little neighbouring cliffs seemed by\r\ntheir very patience to say, \"Ah! when the Indians come we shall have a\r\nfeast.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning we all sallied forth to hunt, and although we had not\r\nmuch success, there were some animated chases. Soon after starting the\r\nparty separated, and so arranged their plans, that at a certain time of\r\nthe day (in guessing which they show much skill) they should all meet\r\nfrom different points of the compass on a plain piece of ground, and\r\nthus drive together the wild animals.  One day I went out hunting at\r\nBahia Blanca, but the men there merely rode in a crescent, each being\r\nabout a quarter of a mile apart from the other.  A fine male ostrich\r\nbeing turned by the headmost riders, tried to escape on one side.  The\r\nGauchos pursued at a reckless pace, twisting their horses about with\r\nthe most admirable command, and each man whirling the balls round his\r\nhead.  At length the foremost threw them, revolving through the air: in\r\nan instant the ostrich rolled over and over, its legs fairly lashed\r\ntogether by the thong. The plains abound with three kinds of partridge,\r\n[3] two of which are as large as hen pheasants.  Their destroyer, a\r\nsmall and pretty fox, was also singularly numerous; in the course of\r\nthe day we could not have seen less than forty or fifty.  They were\r\ngenerally near their earths, but the dogs killed one.  When we returned\r\nto the posta, we found two of the party returned who had been hunting\r\nby themselves. They had killed a puma, and had found an ostrich's nest\r\nwith twenty-seven eggs in it.  Each of these is said to equal in weight\r\neleven hen's eggs; so that we obtained from this one nest as much food\r\nas 297 hen's eggs would have given.\r\n\r\nSeptember 14th.--As the soldiers belonging to the next posta meant to\r\nreturn, and we should together make a party of five, and all armed, I\r\ndetermined not to wait for the expected troops.  My host, the\r\nlieutenant, pressed me much to stop.  As he had been very obliging--not\r\nonly providing me with food, but lending me his private horses--I\r\nwanted to make him some remuneration.  I asked my guide whether I might\r\ndo so, but he told me certainly not; that the only answer I should\r\nreceive, probably would be, \"We have meat for the dogs in our country,\r\nand therefore do not grudge it to a Christian.\" It must not be supposed\r\nthat the rank of lieutenant in such an army would at all prevent the\r\nacceptance of payment: it was only the high sense of hospitality, which\r\nevery traveller is bound to acknowledge as nearly universal throughout\r\nthese provinces.  After galloping some leagues, we came to a low swampy\r\ncountry, which extends for nearly eighty miles northward, as far as the\r\nSierra Tapalguen.  In some parts there were fine damp plains, covered\r\nwith grass, while others had a soft, black, and peaty soil. There were\r\nalso many extensive but shallow lakes, and large beds of reeds.  The\r\ncountry on the whole resembled the better parts of the Cambridgeshire\r\nfens.  At night we had some difficulty in finding amidst the swamps, a\r\ndry place for our bivouac.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15th.--Rose very early in the morning and shortly after\r\npassed the posta where the Indians had murdered the five soldiers.  The\r\nofficer had eighteen chuzo wounds in his body.  By the middle of the\r\nday, after a hard gallop, we reached the fifth posta: on account of\r\nsome difficulty in procuring horses we stayed there the night.  As this\r\npoint was the most exposed on the whole line, twenty-one soldiers were\r\nstationed here; at sunset they returned from hunting, bringing with\r\nthem seven deer, three ostriches, and many armadilloes and partridges.\r\nWhen riding through the country, it is a common practice to set fire to\r\nthe plain; and hence at night, as on this occasion, the horizon was\r\nilluminated in several places by brilliant conflagrations. This is done\r\npartly for the sake of puzzling any stray Indians, but chiefly for\r\nimproving the pasture.  In grassy plains unoccupied by the larger\r\nruminating quadrupeds, it seems necessary to remove the superfluous\r\nvegetation by fire, so as to render the new year's growth serviceable.\r\n\r\nThe rancho at this place did not boast even of a roof, but merely\r\nconsisted of a ring of thistle-stalks, to break the force of the wind.\r\nIt was situated on the borders of an extensive but shallow lake,\r\nswarming with wild fowl, among which the black-necked swan was\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe kind of plover, which appears as if mounted on stilts (Himantopus\r\nnigricollis), is here common in flocks of considerable size.  It has\r\nbeen wrongfully accused of inelegance; when wading about in shallow\r\nwater, which is its favourite resort, its gait is far from awkward.\r\nThese birds in a flock utter a noise, that singularly resembles the cry\r\nof a pack of small dogs in full chase: waking in the night, I have more\r\nthan once been for a moment startled at the distant sound.  The\r\nteru-tero (Vanellus cayanus) is another bird, which often disturbs the\r\nstillness of the night.  In appearance and habits it resembles in many\r\nrespects our peewits; its wings, however, are armed with sharp spurs,\r\nlike those on the legs of the common cock.  As our peewit takes its\r\nname from the sound of its voice, so does the teru-tero. While riding\r\nover the grassy plains, one is constantly pursued by these birds, which\r\nappear to hate mankind, and I am sure deserve to be hated for their\r\nnever-ceasing, unvaried, harsh screams.  To the sportsman they are most\r\nannoying, by telling every other bird and animal of his approach: to\r\nthe traveller in the country, they may possibly, as Molina says, do\r\ngood, by warning him of the midnight robber.  During the breeding\r\nseason, they attempt, like our peewits, by feigning to be wounded, to\r\ndraw away from their nests dogs and other enemies.  The eggs of this\r\nbird are esteemed a great delicacy.\r\n\r\nSeptember 16th.--To the seventh posta at the foot of the Sierra\r\nTapalguen.  The country was quite level, with a coarse herbage and a\r\nsoft peaty soil.  The hovel was here remarkably neat, the posts and\r\nrafters being made of about a dozen dry thistle-stalks bound together\r\nwith thongs of hide; and by the support of these Ionic-like columns,\r\nthe roof and sides were thatched with reeds.  We were here told a fact,\r\nwhich I would not have credited, if I had not had partly ocular proof\r\nof it; namely, that, during the previous night hail as large as small\r\napples, and extremely hard, had fallen with such violence, as to kill\r\nthe greater number of the wild animals.  One of the men had already\r\nfound thirteen deer (Cervus campestris) lying dead, and I saw their\r\n_fresh_ hides; another of the party, a few minutes after my arrival\r\nbrought in seven more.  Now I well know, that one man without dogs\r\ncould hardly have killed seven deer in a week. The men believed they\r\nhad seen about fifteen ostriches (part of one of which we had for\r\ndinner); and they said that several were running about evidently blind\r\nin one eye. Numbers of smaller birds, as ducks, hawks, and partridges,\r\nwere killed.  I saw one of the latter with a black mark on its back, as\r\nif it had been struck with a paving-stone.  A fence of thistle-stalks\r\nround the hovel was nearly broken down, and my informer, putting his\r\nhead out to see what was the matter, received a severe cut, and now\r\nwore a bandage. The storm was said to have been of limited extent: we\r\ncertainly saw from our last night's bivouac a dense cloud and lightning\r\nin this direction.  It is marvellous how such strong animals as deer\r\ncould thus have been killed; but I have no doubt, from the evidence I\r\nhave given, that the story is not in the least exaggerated.  I am glad,\r\nhowever, to have its credibility supported by the Jesuit Dobrizhoffen,\r\n[4] who, speaking of a country much to the northward, says, hail fell\r\nof an enormous size and killed vast numbers of cattle: the Indians\r\nhence called the place _Lalegraicavalca_, meaning \"the little white\r\nthings.\" Dr. Malcolmson, also, informs me that he witnessed in 1831 in\r\nIndia, a hail-storm, which killed numbers of large birds and much\r\ninjured the cattle. These hailstones were flat, and one was ten inches\r\nin circumference, and another weighed two ounces.  They ploughed up a\r\ngravel-walk like musket-balls, and passed through glass-windows, making\r\nround holes, but not cracking them.\r\n\r\nHaving finished our dinner, of hail-stricken meat, we crossed the\r\nSierra Tapalguen; a low range of hills, a few hundred feet in height,\r\nwhich commences at Cape Corrientes. The rock in this part is pure\r\nquartz; further eastward I understand it is granitic.  The hills are of\r\na remarkable form; they consist of flat patches of table-land,\r\nsurrounded by low perpendicular cliffs, like the outliers of a\r\nsedimentary deposit.  The hill which I ascended was very small, not\r\nabove a couple of hundred yards in diameter; but I saw others larger.\r\nOne which goes by the name of the \"Corral,\" is said to be two or three\r\nmiles in diameter, and encompassed by perpendicular cliffs, between\r\nthirty and forty feet high, excepting at one spot, where the entrance\r\nlies.  Falconer [5] gives a curious account of the Indians driving\r\ntroops of wild horses into it, and then by guarding the entrance,\r\nkeeping them secure.  I have never heard of any other instance of\r\ntable-land in a formation of quartz, and which, in the hill I examined,\r\nhad neither cleavage nor stratification.  I was told that the rock of\r\nthe \"Corral\" was white, and would strike fire.\r\n\r\nWe did not reach the posta on the Rio Tapalguen till after it was dark.\r\nAt supper, from something which was said, I was suddenly struck with\r\nhorror at thinking that I was eating one of the favourite dishes of the\r\ncountry namely, a half-formed calf, long before its proper time of\r\nbirth.  It turned out to be Puma; the meat is very white and remarkably\r\nlike veal in taste.  Dr. Shaw was laughed at for stating that \"the\r\nflesh of the lion is in great esteem having no small affinity with\r\nveal, both in colour, taste, and flavour.\" Such certainly is the case\r\nwith the Puma. The Gauchos differ in their opinion, whether the Jaguar\r\nis good eating, but are unanimous in saying that cat is excellent.\r\n\r\nSeptember 17th.--We followed the course of the Rio Tapalguen, through a\r\nvery fertile country, to the ninth posta.  Tapalguen, itself, or the\r\ntown of Tapalguen, if it may be so called, consists of a perfectly\r\nlevel plain, studded over, as far as the eye can reach, with the toldos\r\nor oven-shaped huts of the Indians.  The families of the friendly\r\nIndians, who were fighting on the side of Rosas, resided here. We met\r\nand passed many young Indian women, riding by two or three together on\r\nthe same horse: they, as well as many of the young men, were strikingly\r\nhandsome,--their fine ruddy complexions being the picture of health.\r\nBesides the toldos, there were three ranchos; one inhabited by the\r\nCommandant, and the two others by Spaniards with small shops.\r\n\r\nWe were here able to buy some biscuit.  I had now been several days\r\nwithout tasting anything besides meat: I did not at all dislike this\r\nnew regimen; but I felt as if it would only have agreed with me with\r\nhard exercise.  I have heard that patients in England, when desired to\r\nconfine themselves exclusively to an animal diet, even with the hope of\r\nlife before their eyes, have hardly been able to endure it.  Yet the\r\nGaucho in the Pampas, for months together, touches nothing but beef.\r\nBut they eat, I observe, a very large proportion of fat, which is of a\r\nless animalized nature; and they particularly dislike dry meat, such as\r\nthat of the Agouti. Dr. Richardson [6] also, has remarked, \"that when\r\npeople have fed for a long time solely upon lean animal food, the\r\ndesire for fat becomes so insatiable, that they can consume a large\r\nquantity of unmixed and even oily fat without nausea:\" this appears to\r\nme a curious physiological fact. It is, perhaps, from their meat\r\nregimen that the Gauchos, like other carnivorous animals, can abstain\r\nlong from food. I was told that at Tandeel, some troops voluntarily\r\npursued a party of Indians for three days, without eating or drinking.\r\n\r\nWe saw in the shops many articles, such as horsecloths, belts, and\r\ngarters, woven by the Indian women.  The patterns were very pretty, and\r\nthe colours brilliant; the workmanship of the garters was so good that\r\nan English merchant at Buenos Ayres maintained they must have been\r\nmanufactured in England, till he found the tassels had been fastened by\r\nsplit sinew.\r\n\r\nSeptember 18th.--We had a very long ride this day.  At the twelfth\r\nposta, which is seven leagues south of the Rio Salado, we came to the\r\nfirst estancia with cattle and white women.  Afterwards we had to ride\r\nfor many miles through a country flooded with water above our horses'\r\nknees.  By crossing the stirrups, and riding Arab-like with our legs\r\nbent up, we contrived to keep tolerably dry.  It was nearly dark when\r\nwe arrived at the Salado; the stream was deep, and about forty yards\r\nwide; in summer, however, its bed becomes almost dry, and the little\r\nremaining water nearly as salt as that of the sea.  We slept at one of\r\nthe great estancias of General Rosas.  It was fortified, and of such an\r\nextent, that arriving in the dark I thought it was a town and fortress.\r\nIn the morning we saw immense herds of cattle, the general here having\r\nseventy-four square leagues of land.  Formerly nearly three hundred men\r\nwere employed about this estate, and they defied all the attacks of the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nSeptember 19th.--Passed the Guardia del Monte.  This is a nice\r\nscattered little town, with many gardens, full of peach and quince\r\ntrees.  The plain here looked like that around Buenos Ayres; the turf\r\nbeing short and bright green, with beds of clover and thistles, and\r\nwith bizcacha holes. I was very much struck with the marked change in\r\nthe aspect of the country after having crossed the Salado.  From a\r\ncoarse herbage we passed on to a carpet of fine green verdure. I at\r\nfirst attributed this to some change in the nature of the soil, but the\r\ninhabitants assured me that here, as well as in Banda Oriental, where\r\nthere is as great a difference between the country round Monte Video\r\nand the thinly-inhabited savannahs of Colonia, the whole was to be\r\nattributed to the manuring and grazing of the cattle.  Exactly the same\r\nfact has been observed in the prairies [7] of North America, where\r\ncoarse grass, between five and six feet high, when grazed by cattle,\r\nchanges into common pasture land.  I am not botanist enough to say\r\nwhether the change here is owing to the introduction of new species, to\r\nthe altered growth of the same, or to a difference in their\r\nproportional numbers.  Azara has also observed with astonishment this\r\nchange: he is likewise much perplexed by the immediate appearance of\r\nplants not occurring in the neighbourhood, on the borders of any track\r\nthat leads to a newly-constructed hovel.  In another part he says, [8]\r\n\"ces chevaux (sauvages) ont la manie de preferer les chemins, et le\r\nbord des routes pour deposer leurs excremens, dont on trouve des\r\nmonceaux dans ces endroits.\" Does this not partly explain the\r\ncircumstance?  We thus have lines of richly manured land serving as\r\nchannels of communication across wide districts.\r\n\r\nNear the Guardia we find the southern limit of two European plants, now\r\nbecome extraordinarily common.  The fennel in great profusion covers\r\nthe ditch-banks in the neighbourhood of Buenos Ayres, Monte Video, and\r\nother towns. But the cardoon (Cynara cardunculus) has a far wider\r\nrange: [9] it occurs in these latitudes on both sides of the,\r\nCordillera, across the continent.  I saw it in unfrequented spots in\r\nChile, Entre Rios, and Banda Oriental.  In the latter country alone,\r\nvery many (probably several hundred) square miles are covered by one\r\nmass of these prickly plants, and are impenetrable by man or beast.\r\nOver the undulating plains, where these great beds occur, nothing else\r\ncan now live.  Before their introduction, however, the surface must\r\nhave supported, as in other parts, a rank herbage.  I doubt whether any\r\ncase is on record of an invasion on so grand a scale of one plant over\r\nthe aborigines.  As I have already said, I nowhere saw the cardoon\r\nsouth of the Salado; but it is probable that in proportion as that\r\ncountry becomes inhabited, the cardoon will extend its limits.  The\r\ncase is different with the giant thistle (with variegated leaves) of\r\nthe Pampas, for I met with it in the valley of the Sauce. According to\r\nthe principles so well laid down by Mr. Lyell, few countries have\r\nundergone more remarkable changes, since the year 1535, when the first\r\ncolonist of La Plata landed with seventy-two horses.  The countless\r\nherds of horses, cattle, and sheep, not only have altered the whole\r\naspect of the vegetation, but they have almost banished the guanaco,\r\ndeer and ostrich.  Numberless other changes must likewise have taken\r\nplace; the wild pig in some parts probably replaces the peccari; packs\r\nof wild dogs may be heard howling on the wooded banks of the\r\nless-frequented streams; and the common cat, altered into a large and\r\nfierce animal, inhabits rocky hills.  As M. d'Orbigny has remarked, the\r\nincrease in numbers of the carrion-vulture, since the introduction of\r\nthe domestic animals, must have been infinitely great; and we have\r\ngiven reasons for believing that they have extended their southern\r\nrange.  No doubt many plants, besides the cardoon and fennel, are\r\nnaturalized; thus the islands near the mouth of the Parana, are thickly\r\nclothed with peach and orange trees, springing from seeds carried there\r\nby the waters of the river.\r\n\r\nWhile changing horses at the Guardia several people questioned us much\r\nabout the army,--I never saw anything like the enthusiasm for Rosas,\r\nand for the success of the \"most just of all wars, because against\r\nbarbarians.\" This expression, it must be confessed, is very natural,\r\nfor till lately, neither man, woman nor horse, was safe from the\r\nattacks of the Indians.  We had a long day's ride over the same rich\r\ngreen plain, abounding with various flocks, and with here and there a\r\nsolitary estancia, and its one _ombu_ tree. In the evening it rained\r\nheavily: on arriving at a posthouse we were told by the owner, that if\r\nwe had not a regular passport we must pass on, for there were so many\r\nrobbers he would trust no one.  When he read, however, my passport,\r\nwhich began with \"El Naturalista Don Carlos,\" his respect and civility\r\nwere as unbounded as his suspicions had been before.  What a naturalist\r\nmight be, neither he nor his countrymen, I suspect, had any idea; but\r\nprobably my title lost nothing of its value from that cause.\r\n\r\nSeptember 20th.--We arrived by the middle of the day at Buenos Ayres.\r\nThe outskirts of the city looked quite pretty, with the agave hedges,\r\nand groves of olive, peach and willow trees, all just throwing out\r\ntheir fresh green leaves.  I rode to the house of Mr. Lumb, an English\r\nmerchant, to whose kindness and hospitality, during my stay in the\r\ncountry, I was greatly indebted.\r\n\r\nThe city of Buenos Ayres is large; [10] and I should think one of the\r\nmost regular in the world.  Every street is at right angles to the one\r\nit crosses, and the parallel ones being equidistant, the houses are\r\ncollected into solid squares of equal dimensions, which are called\r\nquadras.  On the other hand, the houses themselves are hollow squares;\r\nall the rooms opening into a neat little courtyard.  They are generally\r\nonly one story high, with flat roofs, which are fitted with seats and\r\nare much frequented by the inhabitants in summer.  In the centre of the\r\ntown is the Plaza, where the public offices, fortress, cathedral, etc.,\r\nstand.  Here also, the old viceroys, before the revolution, had their\r\npalaces.  The general assemblage of buildings possesses considerable\r\narchitectural beauty, although none individually can boast of any.\r\n\r\nThe great _corral_, where the animals are kept for slaughter to supply\r\nfood to this beef-eating population, is one of the spectacles best\r\nworth seeing.  The strength of the horse as compared to that of the\r\nbullock is quite astonishing: a man on horseback having thrown his lazo\r\nround the horns of a beast, can drag it anywhere he chooses.  The\r\nanimal ploughing up the ground with outstretched legs, in vain efforts\r\nto resist the force, generally dashes at full speed to one side; but\r\nthe horse immediately turning to receive the shock, stands so firmly\r\nthat the bullock is almost thrown down, and it is surprising that their\r\nnecks are not broken. The struggle is not, however, one of fair\r\nstrength; the horse's girth being matched against the bullock's\r\nextended neck.  In a similar manner a man can hold the wildest horse,\r\nif caught with the lazo, just behind the ears.  When the bullock has\r\nbeen dragged to the spot where it is to be slaughtered, the matador\r\nwith great caution cuts the hamstrings. Then is given the death bellow;\r\na noise more expressive of fierce agony than any I know.  I have often\r\ndistinguished it from a long distance, and have always known that the\r\nstruggle was then drawing to a close.  The whole sight is horrible and\r\nrevolting: the ground is almost made of bones; and the horses and\r\nriders are drenched with gore.\r\n\r\n[1] I call these thistle-stalks for the want of a more correct name.  I\r\nbelieve it is a species of Eryngium.\r\n\r\n[2] Travels in Africa, p. 233.\r\n\r\n[3] Two species of Tinamus and Eudromia elegans of A. d'Orbigny, which\r\ncan only be called a partridge with regard to its habits.\r\n\r\n[4] History of the Abipones, vol. ii. p. 6.\r\n\r\n[5] Falconer's Patagonia, p. 70.\r\n\r\n[6] Fauna Boreali-Americana, vol. i. p. 35.\r\n\r\n[7] See Mr. Atwater's account of the Prairies, in Silliman's N.

Dr. Hooker (Botanical Magazine, vol.\r\niv. p. 2862), has described a variety of the Cynara from this part of\r\nSouth America under the name of inermis.  He states that botanists are\r\nnow generally agreed that the cardoon and the artichoke are varieties\r\nof one plant. I may add, that an intelligent farmer assured me that he\r\nhad observed in a deserted garden some artichokes changing into the\r\ncommon cardoon.  Dr. Hooker believes that Head's vivid description of\r\nthe thistle of the Pampas applies to the cardoon, but this is a\r\nmistake.  Captain Head referred to the plant, which I have mentioned a\r\nfew lines lower down, under the title of giant thistle.  Whether it is\r\na true thistle I do not know; but it is quite different from the\r\ncardoon; and more like a thistle properly so called.\r\n\r\n[10] It is said to contain 60,000 inhabitants.  Monte Video, the second\r\ntown of importance on the banks of the Plata, has 15,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBUENOS AYRES AND ST.

The roads in the neighbourhood of the city\r\nafter the rainy weather, were extraordinarily bad.  I should never have\r\nthought it possible for a bullock waggon to have crawled along: as it\r\nwas, they scarcely went at the rate of a mile an hour, and a man was\r\nkept ahead, to survey the best line for making the attempt.  The\r\nbullocks were terribly jaded: it is a great mistake to suppose that\r\nwith improved roads, and an accelerated rate of travelling, the\r\nsufferings of the animals increase in the same proportion.  We passed a\r\ntrain of waggons and a troop of beasts on their road to Mendoza.  The\r\ndistance is about 580 geographical miles, and the journey is generally\r\nperformed in fifty days.  These waggons are very long, narrow, and\r\nthatched with reeds; they have only two wheels, the diameter of which\r\nin some cases is as much as ten feet.  Each is drawn by six bullocks,\r\nwhich are urged on by a goad at least twenty feet long: this is\r\nsuspended from within the roof; for the wheel bullocks a smaller one is\r\nkept; and for the intermediate pair, a point projects at right angles\r\nfrom the middle of the long one.\r\n\r\nThe whole apparatus looked like some implement of war.\r\n\r\nSeptember 28th.--We passed the small town of Luxan where there is a\r\nwooden bridge over the river--a most unusual convenience in this\r\ncountry.  We passed also Areco. The plains appeared level, but were not\r\nso in fact; for in various places the horizon was distant.  The\r\nestancias are here wide apart; for there is little good pasture, owing\r\nto the land being covered by beds either of an acrid clover, or of the\r\ngreat thistle.  The latter, well known from the animated description\r\ngiven by Sir F. Head, were at this time of the year two-thirds grown;\r\nin some parts they were as high as the horse's back, but in others they\r\nhad not yet sprung up, and the ground was bare and dusty as on a\r\nturnpike-road.  The clumps were of the most brilliant green, and they\r\nmade a pleasing miniature-likeness of broken forest land.  When the\r\nthistles are full grown, the great beds are impenetrable, except by a\r\nfew tracts, as intricate as those in a labyrinth.  These are only known\r\nto the robbers, who at this season inhabit them, and sally forth at\r\nnight to rob and cut throats with impunity.  Upon asking at a house\r\nwhether robbers were numerous, I was answered, \"The thistles are not up\r\nyet;\"--the meaning of which reply was not at first very obvious. There\r\nis little interest in passing over these tracts, for they are inhabited\r\nby few animals or birds, excepting the bizcacha and its friend the\r\nlittle owl.\r\n\r\nThe bizcacha [1] is well known to form a prominent feature in the\r\nzoology of the Pampas.  It is found as far south as the Rio Negro, in\r\nlat. 41 degs., but not beyond.  It cannot, like the agouti, subsist on\r\nthe gravelly and desert plains of Patagonia, but prefers a clayey or\r\nsandy soil, which produces a different and more abundant vegetation.\r\nNear Mendoza, at the foot of the Cordillera, it occurs in close\r\nneighbourhood with the allied alpine species.  It is a very curious\r\ncircumstance in its geographical distribution, that it has never been\r\nseen, fortunately for the inhabitants of Banda Oriental, to the\r\neastward of the river Uruguay: yet in this province there are plains\r\nwhich appear admirably adapted to its habits. The Uruguay has formed an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to its migration: although the broader barrier of\r\nthe Parana has been passed, and the bizcacha is common in Entre Rios,\r\nthe province between these two great rivers.  Near Buenos Ayres these\r\nanimals are exceedingly common.  Their most favourite resort appears to\r\nbe those parts of the plain which during one-half of the year are\r\ncovered with giant thistles, to the exclusion of other plants.  The\r\nGauchos affirm that it lives on roots; which, from the great strength\r\nof its gnawing teeth, and the kind of places frequented by it, seems\r\nprobable. In the evening the bizcachas come out in numbers, and quietly\r\nsit at the mouths of their burrows on their haunches.  At such times\r\nthey are very tame, and a man on horseback passing by seems only to\r\npresent an object for their grave contemplation.  They run very\r\nawkwardly, and when running out of danger, from their elevated tails\r\nand short front legs much resemble great rats.  Their flesh, when\r\ncooked, is very white and good, but it is seldom used.\r\n\r\nThe bizcacha has one very singular habit; namely, dragging every hard\r\nobject to the mouth of its burrow: around each group of holes many\r\nbones of cattle, stones, thistle-stalks, hard lumps of earth, dry dung,\r\netc., are collected into an irregular heap, which frequently amounts to\r\nas much as a wheelbarrow would contain.  I was credibly informed that a\r\ngentleman, when riding on a dark night, dropped his watch; he returned\r\nin the morning, and by searching the neighbourhood of every bizcacha\r\nhole on the line of road, as he expected, he soon found it.  This habit\r\nof picking up whatever may be lying on the ground anywhere near its\r\nhabitation, must cost much trouble.  For what purpose it is done, I am\r\nquite unable to form even the most remote conjecture: it cannot be for\r\ndefence, because the rubbish is chiefly placed above the mouth of the\r\nburrow, which enters the ground at a very small inclination.  No doubt\r\nthere must exist some good reason; but the inhabitants of the country\r\nare quite ignorant of it.  The only fact which I know analogous to it,\r\nis the habit of that extraordinary Australian bird, the Calodera\r\nmaculata, which makes an elegant vaulted passage of twigs for playing\r\nin, and which collects near the spot, land and sea-shells, bones and\r\nthe feathers of birds, especially brightly coloured ones.  Mr. Gould,\r\nwho has described these facts, informs me, that the natives, when they\r\nlose any hard object, search the playing passages, and he has known a\r\ntobacco-pipe thus recovered.\r\n\r\nThe little owl (Athene cunicularia), which has been so often mentioned,\r\non the plains of Buenos Ayres exclusively inhabits the holes of the\r\nbizcacha; but in Banda Oriental it is its own workman.  During the open\r\nday, but more especially in the evening, these birds may be seen in\r\nevery direction standing frequently by pairs on the hillock near their\r\nburrows.  If disturbed they either enter the hole, or, uttering a\r\nshrill harsh cry, move with a remarkably undulatory flight to a short\r\ndistance, and then turning round, steadily gaze at their pursuer.\r\nOccasionally in the evening they may be heard hooting.  I found in the\r\nstomachs of two which I opened the remains of mice, and I one day saw a\r\nsmall snake killed and carried away.  It is said that snakes are their\r\ncommon prey during the daytime.  I may here mention, as showing on what\r\nvarious kinds of food owls subsist, that a species killed among the\r\nislets of the Chonos Archipelago, had its stomach full of good-sized\r\ncrabs.  In India [2] there is a fishing genus of owls, which likewise\r\ncatches crabs.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we crossed the Rio Arrecife on a simple raft made of\r\nbarrels lashed together, and slept at the post-house on the other side.\r\nI this day paid horse-hire for thirty-one leagues; and although the sun\r\nwas glaring hot I was but little fatigued.  When Captain Head talks of\r\nriding fifty leagues a day, I do not imagine the distance is equal to\r\n150 English miles.  At all events, the thirty-one leagues was only 76\r\nmiles in a straight line, and in an open country I should think four\r\nadditional miles for turnings would be a sufficient allowance.\r\n\r\n29th and 30th.--We continued to ride over plains of the same character.\r\nAt San Nicolas I first saw the noble river of the Parana. At the foot\r\nof the cliff on which the town stands, some large vessels were at\r\nanchor.  Before arriving at Rozario, we crossed the Saladillo, a stream\r\nof fine clear running water, but too saline to drink.  Rozario is a\r\nlarge town built on a dead level plain, which forms a cliff about sixty\r\nfeet high over the Parana.  The river here is very broad, with many\r\nislands, which are low and wooded, as is also the opposite shore. The\r\nview would resemble that of a great lake, if it were not for the\r\nlinear-shaped islets, which alone give the idea of running water.  The\r\ncliffs are the most picturesque part; sometimes they are absolutely\r\nperpendicular, and of a red colour; at other times in large broken\r\nmasses, covered with cacti and mimosa-trees.  The real grandeur,\r\nhowever, of an immense river like this, is derived from reflecting how\r\nimportant a means of communication and commerce it forms between one\r\nnation and another; to what a distance it travels, and from how vast a\r\nterritory it drains the great body of fresh water which flows past your\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nFor many leagues north and south of San Nicolas and Rozario, the\r\ncountry is really level.  Scarcely anything which travellers have\r\nwritten about its extreme flatness, can be considered as exaggeration.\r\nYet I could never find a spot where, by slowly turning round, objects\r\nwere not seen at greater distances in some directions than in others;\r\nand this manifestly proves inequality in the plain.  At sea, a person's\r\neye being six feet above the surface of the water, his horizon is two\r\nmiles and four-fifths distant.  In like manner, the more level the\r\nplain, the more nearly does the horizon approach within these narrow\r\nlimits; and this, in my opinion, entirely destroys that grandeur which\r\none would have imagined that a vast level plain would have possessed.\r\n\r\nOctober 1st.--We started by moonlight and arrived at the Rio Tercero by\r\nsunrise.  The river is also called the Saladillo, and it deserves the\r\nname, for the water is brackish. I stayed here the greater part of the\r\nday, searching for fossil bones.  Besides a perfect tooth of the\r\nToxodon, and many scattered bones, I found two immense skeletons near\r\neach other, projecting in bold relief from the perpendicular cliff of\r\nthe Parana.  They were, however, so completely decayed, that I could\r\nonly bring away small fragments of one of the great molar teeth; but\r\nthese are sufficient to show that the remains belonged to a Mastodon,\r\nprobably to the same species with that, which formerly must have\r\ninhabited the Cordillera in Upper Peru in such great numbers.  The men\r\nwho took me in the canoe, said they had long known of these skeletons,\r\nand had often wondered how they had got there: the necessity of a\r\ntheory being felt, they came to the conclusion that, like the bizcacha,\r\nthe mastodon was formerly a burrowing animal!  In the evening we rode\r\nanother stage, and crossed the Monge, another brackish stream, bearing\r\nthe dregs of the washings of the Pampas.\r\n\r\nOctober 2nd.--We passed through Corunda, which, from the luxuriance of\r\nits gardens, was one of the prettiest villages I saw.  From this point\r\nto St. Fe the road is not very safe.  The western side of the Parana\r\nnorthward, ceases to be inhabited; and hence the Indians sometimes come\r\ndown thus far, and waylay travellers.  The nature of the country also\r\nfavours this, for instead of a grassy plain, there is an open woodland,\r\ncomposed of low prickly mimosas.  We passed some houses that had been\r\nransacked and since deserted; we saw also a spectacle, which my guides\r\nviewed with high satisfaction; it was the skeleton of an Indian with\r\nthe dried skin hanging on the bones, suspended to the branch of a tree.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we arrived at St. Fe. I was surprised to observe how\r\ngreat a change of climate a difference of only three degrees of\r\nlatitude between this place and Buenos Ayres had caused.  This was\r\nevident from the dress and complexion of the men--from the increased\r\nsize of the ombu-trees--the number of new cacti and other plants--and\r\nespecially from the birds.  In the course of an hour I remarked\r\nhalf-a-dozen birds, which I had never seen at Buenos Ayres. Considering\r\nthat there is no natural boundary between the two places, and that the\r\ncharacter of the country is nearly similar, the difference was much\r\ngreater than I should have expected.\r\n\r\nOctober  3rd and 4th.--I was confined for these two days to my bed by a\r\nheadache.  A good-natured old woman, who attended me, wished me to try\r\nmany odd remedies.  A common practice is, to bind an orange-leaf or a\r\nbit of black plaster to each temple: and a still more general plan is,\r\nto split a bean into halves, moisten them, and place one on each\r\ntemple, where they will easily adhere.  It is not thought proper ever\r\nto remove the beans or plaster, but to allow them to drop off, and\r\nsometimes, if a man, with patches on his head, is asked, what is the\r\nmatter? he will answer, \"I had a headache the day before yesterday.\"\r\nMany of the remedies used by the people of the country are ludicrously\r\nstrange, but too disgusting to be mentioned.  One of the least nasty is\r\nto kill and cut open two puppies and bind them on each side of a broken\r\nlimb.  Little hairless dogs are in great request to sleep at the feet\r\nof invalids.\r\n\r\nSt. Fe is a quiet little town, and is kept clean and in good order. The\r\ngovernor, Lopez, was a common soldier at the time of the revolution;\r\nbut has now been seventeen years in power.  This stability of\r\ngovernment is owing to his tyrannical habits; for tyranny seems as yet\r\nbetter adapted to these countries than republicanism.  The governor's\r\nfavourite occupation is hunting Indians: a short time since he\r\nslaughtered forty-eight, and sold the children at the rate of three or\r\nfour pounds apiece.\r\n\r\nOctober 5th.--We crossed the Parana to St. Fe Bajada, a town on the\r\nopposite shore.  The passage took some hours, as the river here\r\nconsisted of a labyrinth of small streams, separated by low wooded\r\nislands.  I had a letter of introduction to an old Catalonian Spaniard,\r\nwho treated me with the most uncommon hospitality.  The Bajada is the\r\ncapital of Entre Rios.  In 1825 the town contained 6000 inhabitants,\r\nand the province 30,000; yet, few as the inhabitants are, no province\r\nhas suffered more from bloody and desperate revolutions.  They boast\r\nhere of representatives, ministers, a standing army, and governors: so\r\nit is no wonder that they have their revolutions.  At some future day\r\nthis must be one of the richest countries of La Plata.  The soil is\r\nvaried and productive; and its almost insular form gives it two grand\r\nlines of communication by the rivers Parana and Uruguay.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was delayed here five days, and employed myself in examining the\r\ngeology of the surrounding country, which was very interesting.  We\r\nhere see at the bottom of the cliffs, beds containing sharks' teeth and\r\nsea-shells of extinct species, passing above into an indurated marl,\r\nand from that into the red clayey earth of the Pampas, with its\r\ncalcareous concretions and the bones of terrestrial quadrupeds.  This\r\nvertical section clearly tells us of a large bay of pure salt-water,\r\ngradually encroached on, and at last converted into the bed of a muddy\r\nestuary, into which floating carcasses were swept.  At Punta Gorda, in\r\nBanda Oriental, I found an alternation of the Pampaean estuary deposit,\r\nwith a limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells; and\r\nthis shows either a change in the former currents, or more probably an\r\noscillation of level in the bottom of the ancient estuary.  Until\r\nlately, my reasons for considering the Pampaean formation to be an\r\nestuary deposit were, its general appearance, its position at the mouth\r\nof the existing great river the Plata, and the presence of so many\r\nbones of terrestrial quadrupeds: but now Professor Ehrenberg has had\r\nthe kindness to examine for me a little of the red earth, taken from\r\nlow down in the deposit, close to the skeletons of the mastodon, and he\r\nfinds in it many infusoria, partly salt-water and partly fresh-water\r\nforms, with the latter rather preponderating; and therefore, as he\r\nremarks, the water must have been brackish.  M. A. d'Orbigny found on\r\nthe banks of the Parana, at the height of a hundred feet, great beds of\r\nan estuary shell, now living a hundred miles lower down nearer the sea;\r\nand I found similar shells at a less height on the banks of the\r\nUruguay; this shows that just before the Pampas was slowly elevated\r\ninto dry land, the water covering it was brackish.  Below Buenos Ayres\r\nthere are upraised beds of sea-shells of existing species, which also\r\nproves that the period of elevation of the Pampas was within the recent\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIn the Pampaean deposit at the Bajada I found the osseous armour of a\r\ngigantic armadillo-like animal, the inside of which, when the earth was\r\nremoved, was like a great cauldron; I found also teeth of the Toxodon\r\nand Mastodon, and one tooth of a Horse, in the same stained and decayed\r\nstate.  This latter tooth greatly interested me, [3] and I took\r\nscrupulous care in ascertaining that it had been embedded\r\ncontemporaneously with the other remains; for I was not then aware that\r\namongst the fossils from Bahia Blanca there was a horse's tooth hidden\r\nin the matrix: nor was it then known with certainty that the remains of\r\nhorses are common in North America.  Mr. Lyell has lately brought from\r\nthe United States a tooth of a horse; and it is an interesting fact,\r\nthat Professor Owen could find in no species, either fossil or recent,\r\na slight but peculiar curvature characterizing it, until he thought of\r\ncomparing it with my specimen found here: he has named this American\r\nhorse Equus curvidens.  Certainly it is a marvellous fact in the\r\nhistory of the Mammalia, that in South America a native horse should\r\nhave lived and disappeared, to be succeeded in after-ages by the\r\ncountless herds descended from the few introduced with the Spanish\r\ncolonists!\r\n\r\nThe existence in South America of a fossil horse, of the mastodon,\r\npossibly of an elephant, [4]  and of a hollow-horned ruminant,\r\ndiscovered by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil, are highly\r\ninteresting facts with respect to the geographical distribution of\r\nanimals.  At the present time, if we divide America, not by the Isthmus\r\nof Panama, but by the southern part of Mexico [5] in lat. 20 degs.,\r\nwhere the great table-land presents an obstacle to the migration of\r\nspecies, by affecting the climate, and by forming, with the exception\r\nof some valleys and of a fringe of low land on the coast, a broad\r\nbarrier; we shall then have the two zoological provinces of North and\r\nSouth America strongly contrasted with each other.  Some few species\r\nalone have passed the barrier, and may be considered as wanderers from\r\nthe south, such as the puma, opossum, kinkajou, and peccari. South\r\nAmerica is characterized by possessing many peculiar gnawers, a family\r\nof monkeys, the llama, peccari, tapir, opossums, and, especially,\r\nseveral genera of Edentata, the order which includes the sloths,\r\nant-eaters, and armadilloes. North America, on the other hand, is\r\ncharacterized (putting on one side a few wandering species) by numerous\r\npeculiar gnawers, and by four genera (the ox, sheep, goat, and\r\nantelope) of hollow-horned ruminants, of which great division South\r\nAmerica is not known to possess a single species. Formerly, but within\r\nthe period when most of the now existing shells were living, North\r\nAmerica possessed, besides hollow-horned ruminants, the elephant,\r\nmastodon, horse, and three genera of Edentata, namely, the Megatherium,\r\nMegalonyx, and Mylodon.  Within nearly this same period (as proved by\r\nthe shells at Bahia Blanca) South America possessed, as we have just\r\nseen, a mastodon, horse, hollow-horned ruminant, and the same three\r\ngenera (as well as several others) of the Edentata.  Hence it is\r\nevident that North and South America, in having within a late\r\ngeological period these several genera in common, were much more\r\nclosely related in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than\r\nthey now are.  The more I reflect on this case, the more interesting it\r\nappears: I know of no other instance where we can almost mark the\r\nperiod and manner of the splitting up of one great region into two\r\nwell-characterized zoological provinces.  The geologist, who is fully\r\nimpressed with the vast oscillations of level which have affected the\r\nearth's crust within late periods, will not fear to speculate on the\r\nrecent elevation of the Mexican platform, or, more probably, on the\r\nrecent submergence of land in the West Indian Archipelago, as the cause\r\nof the present zoological separation of North and South America.  The\r\nSouth American character of the West Indian mammals [6] seems to\r\nindicate that this archipelago was formerly united to the southern\r\ncontinent, and that it has subsequently been an area of subsidence.\r\n\r\nWhen America, and especially North America, possessed its elephants,\r\nmastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants, it was much more closely\r\nrelated in its zoological characters to the temperate parts of Europe\r\nand Asia than it now is.  As the remains of these genera are found on\r\nboth sides of Behring's Straits [7] and on the plains of Siberia, we\r\nare led to look to the north-western side of North America as the\r\nformer point of communication between the Old and so-called New World.\r\nAnd as so many species, both living and extinct, of these same genera\r\ninhabit and have inhabited the Old World, it seems most probable that\r\nthe North American elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned\r\nruminants migrated, on land since submerged near Behring's Straits,\r\nfrom Siberia into North America, and thence, on land since submerged in\r\nthe West Indies, into South America, where for a time they mingled with\r\nthe forms characteristic of that southern continent, and have since\r\nbecome extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile travelling through the country, I received several vivid\r\ndescriptions of the effects of a late great drought; and the account of\r\nthis may throw some light on the cases where vast numbers of animals of\r\nall kinds have been embedded together.  The period included between the\r\nyears 1827 and 1830 is called the \"gran seco,\" or the great drought.\r\nDuring this time so little rain fell, that the vegetation, even to the\r\nthistles, failed; the brooks were dried up, and the whole country\r\nassumed the appearance of a dusty high road.  This was especially the\r\ncase in the northern part of the province of Buenos Ayres and the\r\nsouthern part of St. Fe.  Very great numbers of birds, wild animals,\r\ncattle, and horses perished from the want of food and water.  A man\r\ntold me that the deer [8] used to come into his courtyard to the well,\r\nwhich he had been obliged to dig to supply his own family with water;\r\nand that the partridges had hardly strength to fly away when pursued.\r\nThe lowest estimation of the loss of cattle in the province of Buenos\r\nAyres alone, was taken at one million head.  A proprietor at San Pedro\r\nhad previously to these years 20,000 cattle; at the end not one\r\nremained. San Pedro is situated in the middle of the finest country;\r\nand even now abounds again with animals; yet during the latter part of\r\nthe \"gran seco,\" live cattle were brought in vessels for the\r\nconsumption of the inhabitants. The animals roamed from their\r\nestancias, and, wandering far southward, were mingled together in such\r\nmultitudes, that a government commission was sent from Buenos Ayres to\r\nsettle the disputes of the owners.  Sir Woodbine Parish informed me of\r\nanother and very curious source of dispute; the ground being so long\r\ndry, such quantities of dust were blown about, that in this open\r\ncountry the landmarks became obliterated, and people could not tell the\r\nlimits of their estates.\r\n\r\nI was informed by an eye-witness that the cattle in herds of thousands\r\nrushed into the Parana, and being exhausted by hunger they were unable\r\nto crawl up the muddy banks, and thus were drowned.  The arm of the\r\nriver which runs by San Pedro was so full of putrid carcasses, that the\r\nmaster of a vessel told me that the smell rendered it quite impassable.\r\nWithout doubt several hundred thousand animals thus perished in the\r\nriver: their bodies when putrid were seen floating down the stream; and\r\nmany in all probability were deposited in the estuary of the Plata. All\r\nthe small rivers became highly saline, and this caused the death of\r\nvast numbers in particular spots; for when an animal drinks of such\r\nwater it does not recover.  Azara describes [9] the fury of the wild\r\nhorses on a similar occasion, rushing into the marshes, those which\r\narrived first being overwhelmed and crushed by those which followed. He\r\nadds that more than once he has seen the carcasses of upwards of a\r\nthousand wild horses thus destroyed.  I noticed that the smaller\r\nstreams in the Pampas were paved with a breccia of bones but this\r\nprobably is the effect of a gradual increase, rather than of the\r\ndestruction at any one period.  Subsequently to the drought of 1827 to\r\n1832, a very rainy season followed which caused great floods.  Hence it\r\nis almost certain that some thousands of the skeletons were buried by\r\nthe deposits of the very next year.  What would be the opinion of a\r\ngeologist, viewing such an enormous collection of bones, of all kinds\r\nof animals and of all ages, thus embedded in one thick earthy mass?\r\nWould he not attribute it to a flood having swept over the surface of\r\nthe land, rather than to the common order of things? [10]\r\n\r\nOctober 12th.--I had intended to push my excursion further, but not\r\nbeing quite well, I was compelled to return by a balandra, or\r\none-masted vessel of about a hundred tons' burden, which was bound to\r\nBuenos Ayres.  As the weather was not fair, we moored early in the day\r\nto a branch of a tree on one of the islands.  The Parana is full of\r\nislands, which undergo a constant round of decay and renovation. In the\r\nmemory of the master several large ones had disappeared, and others\r\nagain had been formed and protected by vegetation.  They are composed\r\nof muddy sand, without even the smallest pebble, and were then about\r\nfour feet above the level of the river; but during the periodical\r\nfloods they are inundated.  They all present one character; numerous\r\nwillows and a few other trees are bound together by a great variety of\r\ncreeping plants, thus forming a thick jungle. These thickets afford a\r\nretreat for capybaras and jaguars. The fear of the latter animal quite\r\ndestroyed all pleasure in scrambling through the woods.  This evening I\r\nhad not proceeded a hundred yards, before finding indubitable signs of\r\nthe recent presence of the tiger, I was obliged to come back.  On every\r\nisland there were tracks; and as on the former excursion \"el rastro de\r\nlos Indios\" had been the subject of conversation, so in this was \"el\r\nrastro del tigre.\" The wooded banks of the great rivers appear to be\r\nthe favourite haunts of the jaguar; but south of the Plata, I was told\r\nthat they frequented the reeds bordering lakes: wherever they are, they\r\nseem to require water.  Their common prey is the capybara, so that it\r\nis generally said, where capybaras are numerous there is little danger\r\nfrom the jaguar.  Falconer states that near the southern side of the\r\nmouth of the Plata there are many jaguars, and that they chiefly live\r\non fish; this account I have heard repeated.  On the Parana they have\r\nkilled many wood-cutters, and have even entered vessels at night. There\r\nis a man now living in the Bajada, who, coming up from below when it\r\nwas dark, was seized on the deck; he escaped, however, with the loss of\r\nthe use of one arm.  When the floods drive these animals from the\r\nislands, they are most dangerous.  I was told that a few years since a\r\nvery large one found its way into a church at St. Fe: two padres\r\nentering one after the other were killed, and a third, who came to see\r\nwhat was the matter, escaped with difficulty.  The beast was destroyed\r\nby being shot from a corner of the building which was unroofed. They\r\ncommit also at these times great ravages among cattle and horses.  It\r\nis said that they kill their prey by breaking their necks.  If driven\r\nfrom the carcass, they seldom return to it.  The Gauchos say that the\r\njaguar, when wandering about at night, is much tormented by the foxes\r\nyelping as they follow him.  This is a curious coincidence with the\r\nfact which is generally affirmed of the jackals accompanying, in a\r\nsimilarly officious manner, the East Indian tiger.  The jaguar is a\r\nnoisy animal, roaring much by night, and especially before bad weather.\r\n\r\nOne day, when hunting on the banks of the Uruguay, I was shown certain\r\ntrees, to which these animals constantly recur for the purpose, as it\r\nis said, of sharpening their claws.  I saw three well-known trees; in\r\nfront, the bark was worn smooth, as if by the breast of the animal, and\r\non each side there were deep scratches, or rather grooves, extending in\r\nan oblique line, nearly a yard in length.  The scars were of different\r\nages.  A common method of ascertaining whether a jaguar is in the\r\nneighbourhood is to examine these trees.  I imagine this habit of the\r\njaguar is exactly similar to one which may any day be seen in the\r\ncommon cat, as with outstretched legs and exserted claws it scrapes the\r\nleg of a chair; and I have heard of young fruit-trees in an orchard in\r\nEngland having been thus much injured. Some such habit must also be\r\ncommon to the puma, for on the bare hard soil of Patagonia I have\r\nfrequently seen scores so deep that no other animal could have made\r\nthem.  The object of this practice is, I believe, to tear off the\r\nragged points of their claws, and not, as the Gauchos think, to sharpen\r\nthem.  The jaguar is killed, without much difficulty, by the aid of\r\ndogs baying and driving him up a tree, where he is despatched with\r\nbullets.\r\n\r\nOwing to bad weather we remained two days at our moorings. Our only\r\namusement was catching fish for our dinner: there were several kinds,\r\nand all good eating.  A fish called the \"armado\" (a Silurus) is\r\nremarkable from a harsh grating noise which it makes when caught by\r\nhook and line, and which can be distinctly heard when the fish is\r\nbeneath the water.  This same fish has the power of firmly catching\r\nhold of any object, such as the blade of an oar or the fishing-line,\r\nwith the strong spine both of its pectoral and dorsal fin.  In the\r\nevening the weather was quite tropical, the thermometer standing at 79\r\ndegs.  Numbers of fireflies were hovering about, and the musquitoes\r\nwere very troublesome. I exposed my hand for five minutes, and it was\r\nsoon black with them; I do not suppose there could have been less than\r\nfifty, all busy sucking.\r\n\r\nOctober 15th.--We got under way and passed Punta Gorda, where there is\r\na colony of tame Indians from the province of Missiones.  We sailed\r\nrapidly down the current, but before sunset, from a silly fear of bad\r\nweather, we brought-to in a narrow arm of the river.  I took the boat\r\nand rowed some distance up this creek.  It was very narrow, winding,\r\nand deep; on each side a wall thirty or forty feet high, formed by\r\ntrees intwined with creepers, gave to the canal a singularly gloomy\r\nappearance.  I here saw a very extraordinary bird, called the\r\nScissor-beak (Rhynchops nigra).  It has short legs, web feet, extremely\r\nlong-pointed wings, and is of about the size of a tern.  The beak is\r\nflattened laterally, that is, in a plane at right angles to that of a\r\nspoonbill or duck.  It is as flat and elastic as an ivory paper-cutter,\r\nand the lower mandible, differing from every other bird, is an inch and\r\na half longer than the upper.  In a lake near Maldonado, from which the\r\nwater had been nearly drained, and which, in consequence, swarmed with\r\nsmall fry, I saw several of these birds, generally in small flocks,\r\nflying rapidly backwards and forwards close to the surface of the lake.\r\nThey kept their bills wide open, and the lower mandible half buried in\r\nthe water.  Thus skimming the surface, they ploughed it in their\r\ncourse: the water was quite smooth, and it formed a most curious\r\nspectacle to behold a flock, each bird leaving its narrow wake on the\r\nmirror-like surface.  In their flight they frequently twist about with\r\nextreme quickness, and dexterously manage with their projecting lower\r\nmandible to plough up small fish, which are secured by the upper and\r\nshorter half of their scissor-like\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nbills.  This fact I repeatedly saw, as, like swallows, they continued\r\nto fly backwards and forwards close before me. Occasionally when\r\nleaving the surface of the water their flight was wild, irregular, and\r\nrapid; they then uttered loud harsh cries.  When these birds are\r\nfishing, the advantage of the long primary feathers of their wings, in\r\nkeeping them dry, is very evident.  When thus employed, their forms\r\nresemble the symbol by which many artists represent marine birds. Their\r\ntails are much used in steering their irregular course.\r\n\r\nThese birds are common far inland along the course of the Rio Parana;\r\nit is said that they remain here during the whole year, and breed in\r\nthe marshes.  During the day they rest in flocks on the grassy plains\r\nat some distance from the water.  Being at anchor, as I have said, in\r\none of the deep creeks between the islands of the Parana, as the\r\nevening drew to a close, one of these scissor-beaks suddenly appeared.\r\nThe water was quite still, and many little fish were rising.  The bird\r\ncontinued for a long time to skim the surface, flying in its wild and\r\nirregular manner up and down the narrow canal, now dark with the\r\ngrowing night and the shadows of the overhanging trees.  At Monte\r\nVideo, I observed that some large flocks during the day remained on the\r\nmud-banks at the head of the harbour, in the same manner as on the\r\ngrassy plains near the Parana; and every evening they took flight\r\nseaward.  From these facts I suspect that the Rhynchops generally\r\nfishes by night, at which time many of the lower animals come most\r\nabundantly to the surface.  M. Lesson states that he has seen these\r\nbirds opening the shells of the mactrae buried in the sand-banks on the\r\ncoast of Chile: from their weak bills, with the lower mandible so much\r\nprojecting, their short legs and long wings, it is very improbable that\r\nthis can be a general habit.\r\n\r\nIn our course down the Parana, I observed only three other birds, whose\r\nhabits are worth mentioning.  One is a small kingfisher (Ceryle\r\nAmericana); it has a longer tail than the European species, and hence\r\ndoes not sit in so stiff and upright a position.  Its flight also,\r\ninstead of being direct and rapid, like the course of an arrow, is weak\r\nand undulatory, as among the soft-billed birds.  It utters a low note,\r\nlike the clicking together of two small stones.  A small green parrot\r\n(Conurus murinus), with a grey breast, appears to prefer the tall trees\r\non the islands to any other situation for its building-place.  A number\r\nof nests are placed so close together as to form one great mass of\r\nsticks. These parrots always live in flocks, and commit great ravages\r\non the corn-fields.  I was told, that near Colonia 2500 were killed in\r\nthe course of one year.  A bird with a forked tail, terminated by two\r\nlong feathers (Tyrannus savana), and named by the Spaniards\r\nscissor-tail, is very common near Buenos Ayres: it commonly sits on a\r\nbranch of the _ombu_ tree, near a house, and thence takes a short\r\nflight in pursuit of insects, and returns to the same spot.  When on\r\nthe wing it presents in its manner of flight and general appearance a\r\ncaricature-likeness of the common swallow.  It has the power of turning\r\nvery shortly in the air, and in so doing opens and shuts its tail,\r\nsometimes in a horizontal or lateral and sometimes in a vertical\r\ndirection, just like a pair of scissors.\r\n\r\nOctober 16th.--Some leagues below Rozario, the western shore of the\r\nParana is bounded by perpendicular cliffs, which extend in a long line\r\nto below San Nicolas; hence it more resembles a sea-coast than that of\r\na fresh-water river. It is a great drawback to the scenery of the\r\nParana, that, from the soft nature of its banks, the water is very\r\nmuddy. The Uruguay, flowing through a granitic country, is much\r\nclearer; and where the two channels unite at the head of the Plata, the\r\nwaters may for a long distance be distinguished by their black and red\r\ncolours.  In the evening, the wind being not quite fair, as usual we\r\nimmediately moored, and the next day, as it blew rather freshly, though\r\nwith a favouring current, the master was much too indolent to think of\r\nstarting.  At Bajada, he was described to me as \"hombre muy aflicto\"--a\r\nman always miserable to get on; but certainly he bore all delays with\r\nadmirable resignation.  He was an old Spaniard, and had been many years\r\nin this country.  He professed a great liking to the English, but\r\nstoutly maintained that the battle of Trafalgar was merely won by the\r\nSpanish captains having been all bought over; and that the only really\r\ngallant action on either side was performed by the Spanish admiral.  It\r\nstruck me as rather characteristic, that this man should prefer his\r\ncountrymen being thought the worst of traitors, rather than unskilful\r\nor cowardly.\r\n\r\n18th and 19th.--We continued slowly to sail down the noble stream: the\r\ncurrent helped us but little.  We met, during our descent, very few\r\nvessels.  One of the best gifts of nature, in so grand a channel of\r\ncommunication, seems here wilfully thrown away--a river in which ships\r\nmight navigate from a temperate country, as surprisingly abundant in\r\ncertain productions as destitute of others, to another possessing a\r\ntropical climate, and a soil which, according to the best of judges, M.\r\nBonpland, is perhaps unequalled in fertility in any part of the world.\r\nHow different would have been the aspect of this river if English\r\ncolonists had by good fortune first sailed up the Plata!  What noble\r\ntowns would now have occupied its shores!  Till the death of Francia,\r\nthe Dictator of Paraguay, these two countries must remain distinct, as\r\nif placed on opposite sides of the globe. And when the old\r\nbloody-minded tyrant is gone to his long account, Paraguay will be torn\r\nby revolutions, violent in proportion to the previous unnatural calm.\r\nThat country will have to learn, like every other South American state,\r\nthat a republic cannot succeed till it contains a certain body of men\r\nimbued with the principles of justice and honour.\r\n\r\nOctober 20th.--Being arrived at the mouth of the Parana, and as I was\r\nvery anxious to reach Buenos Ayres, I went on shore at Las Conchas,\r\nwith the intention of riding there. Upon landing, I found to my great\r\nsurprise that I was to a certain degree a prisoner.  A violent\r\nrevolution having broken out, all the ports were laid under an embargo.\r\nI could not return to my vessel, and as for going by land to the city,\r\nit was out of the question.  After a long conversation with the\r\ncommandant, I obtained permission to go the next day to General Rolor,\r\nwho commanded a division of the rebels on this side the capital.  In\r\nthe morning I rode to the encampment.  The general, officers, and\r\nsoldiers, all appeared, and I believe really were, great villains.  The\r\ngeneral, the very evening before he left the city, voluntarily went to\r\nthe Governor, and with his hand to his heart, pledged his word of\r\nhonour that he at least would remain faithful to the last.  The general\r\ntold me that the city was in a state of close blockade, and that all he\r\ncould do was to give me a passport to the commander-in-chief of the\r\nrebels at Quilmes. We had therefore to take a great sweep round the\r\ncity, and it was with much difficulty that we procured horses. My\r\nreception at the encampment was quite civil, but I was told it was\r\nimpossible that I could be allowed to enter the city.  I was very\r\nanxious about this, as I anticipated the Beagle's departure from the\r\nRio Plata earlier than it took place.  Having mentioned, however,\r\nGeneral Rosas's obliging kindness to me when at the Colorado, magic\r\nitself could not have altered circumstances quicker than did this\r\nconversation.  I was instantly told that though they could not give me\r\na passport, if I chose to leave my guide and horses, I might pass their\r\nsentinels.  I was too glad to accept of this, and an officer was sent\r\nwith me to give directions that I should not be stopped at the bridge.\r\nThe road for the space of a league was quite deserted.  I met one party\r\nof soldiers, who were satisfied by gravely looking at an old passport:\r\nand at length I was not a little pleased to find myself within the city.\r\n\r\nThis revolution was supported by scarcely any pretext of grievances:\r\nbut in a state which, in the course of nine months (from February to\r\nOctober, 1820), underwent fifteen changes in its government--each\r\ngovernor, according to the constitution, being elected for three\r\nyears--it would be very unreasonable to ask for pretexts.  In this\r\ncase, a party of men--who, being attached to Rosas, were disgusted with\r\nthe governor Balcarce--to the number of seventy left the city, and with\r\nthe cry of Rosas the whole country took arms. The city was then\r\nblockaded, no provisions, cattle or horses, were allowed to enter;\r\nbesides this, there was only a little skirmishing, and a few men daily\r\nkilled.  The outside party well knew that by stopping the supply of\r\nmeat they would certainly be victorious.  General Rosas could not have\r\nknown of this rising; but it appears to be quite consonant with the\r\nplans of his party.  A year ago he was elected governor, but he refused\r\nit, unless the Sala would also confer on him extraordinary powers. This\r\nwas refused, and since then his party have shown that no other governor\r\ncan keep his place.  The warfare on both sides was avowedly protracted\r\ntill it was possible to hear from Rosas.  A note arrived a few days\r\nafter I left Buenos Ayres, which stated that the General disapproved of\r\npeace having been broken, but that he thought the outside party had\r\njustice on their side.  On the bare reception of this, the Governor,\r\nministers, and part of the military, to the number of some hundreds,\r\nfled from the city.  The rebels entered, elected a new governor, and\r\nwere paid for their services to the number of 5500 men. From these\r\nproceedings, it was clear that Rosas ultimately would become the\r\ndictator: to the term king, the people in this, as in other republics,\r\nhave a particular dislike.  Since leaving South America, we have heard\r\nthat Rosas has been elected, with powers and for a time altogether\r\nopposed to the constitutional principles of the republic.\r\n\r\n[1] The bizcacha (Lagostomus trichodactylus) somewhat resembles a large\r\nrabbit, but with bigger gnawing teeth and a long tail; it has, however,\r\nonly three toes behind, like the agouti.  During the last three or four\r\nyears the skins of these animals have been sent to England for the sake\r\nof the fur.\r\n\r\n[2] Journal of Asiatic Soc., vol. v. p. 363.\r\n\r\n[3] I need hardly state here that there is good evidence against any\r\nhorse living in America at the time of Columbus.\r\n\r\n[4] Cuvier.

The section from Vera Cruz to\r\nAcapulco, given by Humboldt in the Polit. Essay on Kingdom of N. Spain\r\nwill show how immense a barrier the Mexican table-land forms.  Dr.\r\nRichardson, in his admirable Report on the Zoology of N. America read\r\nbefore the Brit. Assoc. 1836 (p. 157), talking of the identification of\r\na Mexican animal with the Synetheres prehensilis, says, \"We do not know\r\nwith what propriety, but if correct, it is, if not a solitary instance,\r\nat least very nearly so, of a rodent animal being common to North and\r\nSouth America.\"\r\n\r\n[6] See Dr. Richardson's Report, p. 157; also L'Institut, 1837, p. 253.\r\nCuvier says the kinkajou is found in the larger Antilles, but this is\r\ndoubtful.  M. Gervais states that the Didelphis crancrivora is found\r\nthere.  It is certain that the West Indies possess some mammifers\r\npeculiar to themselves.  A tooth of a mastadon has been brought from\r\nBahama; Edin. New Phil. Journ., 1826, p. 395.\r\n\r\n[7] See the admirable Appendix by Dr. Buckland to Beechey's Voyage;\r\nalso the writings of Chamisso in Kotzebue's Voyage.\r\n\r\n[8] In Captain Owen's Surveying Voyage (vol. ii. p. 274) there is a\r\ncurious account of the effects of a drought on the elephants, at\r\nBenguela (west coast of Africa).  \"A number of these animals had some\r\ntime since entered the town, in a body, to possess themselves of the\r\nwells, not being able to procure any water in the country.  The\r\ninhabitants mustered, when a desperate conflict ensued, which\r\nterminated in the ultimate discomfiture of the invaders, but not until\r\nthey had killed one man, and wounded several others.\" The town is said\r\nto have a population of nearly three thousand!  Dr. Malcolmson informs\r\nme that, during a great drought in India, the wild animals entered the\r\ntents of some troops at Ellore, and that a hare drank out of a vessel\r\nheld by the adjutant of the regiment.\r\n\r\n[9] Travels, vol. i. p. 374.\r\n\r\n[10] These droughts to a certain degree seem to be almost periodical; I\r\nwas told the dates of several others, and the intervals were about\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nBANDA ORIENTAL AND PATAGONIA\r\n\r\nExcursion to Colonia del Sacramiento--Value of an Estancia--Cattle, how\r\ncounted--Singular Breed of Oxen--Perforated Pebbles--Shepherd\r\nDogs--Horses broken-in, Gauchos riding--Character of Inhabitants--Rio\r\nPlata--Flocks of Butterflies--Aeronaut Spiders--Phosphorescence of the\r\nSea--Port Desire--Guanaco--Port St. Julian--Geology of\r\nPatagonia--Fossil gigantic Animal--Types of Organization\r\nconstant--Change in the Zoology of America--Causes of Extinction.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING been delayed for nearly a fortnight in the city, I was glad to\r\nescape on board a packet bound for Monte Video.  A town in a state of\r\nblockade must always be a disagreeable place of residence; in this case\r\nmoreover there were constant apprehensions from robbers within.  The\r\nsentinels were the worst of all; for, from their office and from having\r\narms in their hands, they robbed with a degree of authority which other\r\nmen could not imitate.\r\n\r\nOur passage was a very long and tedious one.  The Plata looks like a\r\nnoble estuary on the map; but is in truth a poor affair.  A wide\r\nexpanse of muddy water has neither grandeur nor beauty.  At one time of\r\nthe day, the two shores, both of which are extremely low, could just be\r\ndistinguished from the deck.  On arriving at Monte Video I found that\r\nthe Beagle would not sail for some time, so I prepared for a short\r\nexcursion in this part of Banda Oriental.  Everything which I have said\r\nabout the country near Maldonado is applicable to Monte Video; but the\r\nland, with the one exception of the Green Mount 450 feet high, from\r\nwhich it takes its name, is far more level.  Very little of the\r\nundulating grassy plain is enclosed; but near the town there are a few\r\nhedge-banks, covered with agaves, cacti, and fennel.\r\n\r\nNovember 14th.--We left Monte Video in the afternoon. I intended to\r\nproceed to Colonia del Sacramiento, situated on the northern bank of\r\nthe Plata and opposite to Buenos Ayres, and thence, following up the\r\nUruguay, to the village of Mercedes on the Rio Negro (one of the many\r\nrivers of this name in South America), and from this point to return\r\ndirect to Monte Video.  We slept at the house of my guide at Canelones.\r\nIn the morning we rose early, in the hopes of being able to ride a good\r\ndistance; but it was a vain attempt, for all the rivers were flooded.\r\nWe passed in boats the streams of Canelones, St. Lucia, and San Jose,\r\nand thus lost much time.  On a former excursion I crossed the Lucia\r\nnear its mouth, and I was surprised to observe how easily our horses,\r\nalthough not used to swim, passed over a width of at least six hundred\r\nyards.  On mentioning this at Monte Video, I was told that a vessel\r\ncontaining some mountebanks and their horses, being wrecked in the\r\nPlata, one horse swam seven miles to the shore.  In the course of the\r\nday I was amused by the dexterity with which a Gaucho forced a restive\r\nhorse to swim a river.  He stripped off his clothes, and jumping on its\r\nback, rode into the water till it was out of its depth; then slipping\r\noff over the crupper, he caught hold of the tail, and as often as the\r\nhorse turned round the man frightened it back by splashing water in its\r\nface. As soon as the horse touched the bottom on the other side, the\r\nman pulled himself on, and was firmly seated, bridle in hand, before\r\nthe horse gained the bank.  A naked man on a naked horse is a fine\r\nspectacle; I had no idea how well the two animals suited each other.\r\nThe tail of a horse is a very useful appendage; I have passed a river\r\nin a boat with four people in it, which was ferried across in the same\r\nway as the Gaucho.  If a man and horse have to cross a broad river, the\r\nbest plan is for the man to catch hold of the pommel or mane, and help\r\nhimself with the other arm.\r\n\r\nWe slept and stayed the following day at the post of Cufre.  In the\r\nevening the postman or letter-carrier arrived. He was a day after his\r\ntime, owing to the Rio Rozario being flooded.  It would not, however,\r\nbe of much consequence; for, although he had passed through some of the\r\nprincipal towns in Banda Oriental, his luggage consisted of two\r\nletters! The view from the house was pleasing; an undulating green\r\nsurface, with distant glimpses of the Plata.  I find that I look at\r\nthis province with very different eyes from what I did upon my first\r\narrival.  I recollect I then thought it singularly level; but now,\r\nafter galloping over the Pampas, my only surprise is, what could have\r\ninduced me ever to call it level.  The country is a series of\r\nundulations, in themselves perhaps not absolutely great, but, as\r\ncompared to the plains of St. Fe, real mountains.  From these\r\ninequalities there is an abundance of small rivulets, and the turf is\r\ngreen and luxuriant.\r\n\r\nNovember 17th.--We crossed the Rozario, which was deep and rapid, and\r\npassing the village of Colla, arrived at midday at Colonia del\r\nSacramiento.  The distance is twenty leagues, through a country covered\r\nwith fine grass, but poorly stocked with cattle or inhabitants.  I was\r\ninvited to sleep at Colonia, and to accompany on the following day a\r\ngentleman to his estancia, where there were some limestone rocks.  The\r\ntown is built on a stony promontory something in the same manner as at\r\nMonte Video.  It is strongly fortified, but both fortifications and\r\ntown suffered much in the Brazilian war.  It is very ancient; and the\r\nirregularity of the streets, and the surrounding groves of old orange\r\nand peach trees, gave it a pretty appearance. The church is a curious\r\nruin; it was used as a powder-magazine, and was struck by lightning in\r\none of the ten thousand thunderstorms of the Rio Plata.  Two-thirds of\r\nthe building were blown away to the very foundation; and the rest\r\nstands a shattered and curious monument of the united powers of\r\nlightning and gunpowder.  In the evening I wandered about the\r\nhalf-demolished walls of the town.  It was the chief seat of the\r\nBrazilian war;--a war most injurious to this country, not so much in\r\nits immediate effects, as in being the origin of a multitude of\r\ngenerals and all other grades of officers.  More generals are numbered\r\n(but not paid) in the United Provinces of La Plata than in the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain.  These gentlemen have learned to like power,\r\nand do not object to a little skirmishing.  Hence there are many always\r\non the watch to create disturbance and to overturn a government which\r\nas yet has never rested on any staple foundation.  I noticed, however,\r\nboth here and in other places, a very general interest in the ensuing\r\nelection for the President; and this appears a good sign for the\r\nprosperity of this little country.  The inhabitants do not require much\r\neducation in their representatives; I heard some men discussing the\r\nmerits of those for Colonia; and it was said that, \"although they were\r\nnot men of business, they could all sign their names:\" with this they\r\nseemed to think every reasonable man ought to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n18th.--Rode with my host to his estancia, at the Arroyo de San Juan. In\r\nthe evening we took a ride round the estate: it contained two square\r\nleagues and a half, and was situated in what is called a rincon; that\r\nis, one side was fronted by the Plata, and the two others guarded by\r\nimpassable brooks.  There was an excellent port for little vessels, and\r\nan abundance of small wood, which is valuable as supplying fuel to\r\nBuenos Ayres.  I was curious to know the value of so complete an\r\nestancia.  Of cattle there were 3000, and it would well support three\r\nor four times that number; of mares 800, together with 150 broken-in\r\nhorses, and 600 sheep.  There was plenty of water and limestone, a\r\nrough house, excellent corrals, and a peach orchard.  For all this he\r\nhad been offered 2000 Pounds, and he only wanted 500 Pounds additional,\r\nand probably would sell it for less.  The chief trouble with an\r\nestancia is driving the cattle twice a week to a central spot, in order\r\nto make them tame, and to count them.  This latter operation would be\r\nthought difficult, where there are ten or fifteen thousand head\r\ntogether.  It is managed on the principle that the cattle invariably\r\ndivide themselves into little troops of from forty to one hundred. Each\r\ntroop is recognized by a few peculiarly marked animals, and its number\r\nis known: so that, one being lost out of ten thousand, it is perceived\r\nby its absence from one of the tropillas.  During a stormy night the\r\ncattle all mingle together; but the next morning the tropillas separate\r\nas before; so that each animal must know its fellow out of ten thousand\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions I met with in this province some oxen of a very\r\ncurious breed, called nata or niata.  They appear externally to hold\r\nnearly the same relation to other cattle, which bull or pug dogs do to\r\nother dogs.  Their forehead is very short and broad, with the nasal end\r\nturned up, and the upper lip much drawn back; their lower jaws project\r\nbeyond the upper, and have a corresponding upward curve; hence their\r\nteeth are always exposed.  Their nostrils are seated high up and are\r\nvery open; their eyes project outwards. When walking they carry their\r\nheads low, on a short neck; and their hinder legs are rather longer\r\ncompared with the front legs than is usual.  Their bare teeth, their\r\nshort heads, and upturned nostrils give them the most ludicrous\r\nself-confident air of defiance imaginable.\r\n\r\nSince my return, I have procured a skeleton head, through the kindness\r\nof my friend Captain Sulivan, R. N., which is now deposited in the\r\nCollege of Surgeons. [1] Don F. Muniz, of Luxan, has kindly collected\r\nfor me all the information which he could respecting this breed.  From\r\nhis account it seems that about eighty or ninety years ago, they were\r\nrare and kept as curiosities at Buenos Ayres.  The breed is universally\r\nbelieved to have originated amongst the Indians southward of the Plata;\r\nand that it was with them the commonest kind.  Even to this day, those\r\nreared in the provinces near the Plata show their less civilized\r\norigin, in being fiercer than common cattle, and in the cow easily\r\ndeserting her first calf, if visited too often or molested.  It is a\r\nsingular fact that an almost similar structure to the abnormal [2] one\r\nof the niata breed, characterizes, as I am informed by Dr. Falconer,\r\nthat great extinct ruminant of India, the Sivatherium.  The breed is\r\nvery _true_; and a niata bull and cow invariably produce niata calves.\r\nA niata bull with a common cow, or the reverse cross, produces\r\noffspring having an intermediate character, but with the niata\r\ncharacters strongly displayed: according to Senor Muniz, there is the\r\nclearest evidence, contrary to the common belief of agriculturists in\r\nanalogous cases, that the niata cow when crossed with a common bull\r\ntransmits her peculiarities more strongly than the niata bull when\r\ncrossed with a common cow.  When the pasture is tolerably long, the\r\nniata cattle feed with the tongue and palate as well as common cattle;\r\nbut during the great droughts, when so many animals perish, the niata\r\nbreed is under a great disadvantage, and would be exterminated if not\r\nattended to; for the common cattle, like horses, are able just to keep\r\nalive, by browsing with their lips on twigs of trees and reeds; this\r\nthe niatas cannot so well do, as their lips do not join, and hence they\r\nare found to perish before the common cattle.  This strikes me as a\r\ngood illustration of how little we are able to judge from the ordinary\r\nhabits of life, on what circumstances, occurring only at long\r\nintervals, the rarity or extinction of a species may be determined.\r\n\r\nNovember 19th.--Passing the valley of Las Vacas, we slept at a house of\r\na North American, who worked a lime-kiln on the Arroyo de las Vivoras.\r\nIn the morning we rode to a protecting headland on the banks of the\r\nriver, called Punta Gorda.  On the way we tried to find a jaguar. There\r\nwere plenty of fresh tracks, and we visited the trees, on which they\r\nare said to sharpen their claws; but we did not succeed in disturbing\r\none.  From this point the Rio Uruguay presented to our view a noble\r\nvolume of water.  From the clearness and rapidity of the stream, its\r\nappearance was far superior to that of its neighbour the Parana.  On\r\nthe opposite coast, several branches from the latter river entered the\r\nUruguay.  As the sun was shining, the two colours of the waters could\r\nbe seen quite distinct.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we proceeded on our road towards Mercedes on the Rio\r\nNegro.  At night we asked permission to sleep at an estancia at which\r\nwe happened to arrive.  It was a very large estate, being ten leagues\r\nsquare, and the owner is one of the greatest landowners in the country.\r\nHis nephew had charge of it, and with him there was a captain in the\r\narmy, who the other day ran away from Buenos Ayres. Considering their\r\nstation, their conversation was rather amusing.  They expressed, as was\r\nusual, unbounded astonishment at the globe being round, and could\r\nscarcely credit that a hole would, if deep enough, come out on the\r\nother side.  They had, however, heard of a country where there were six\r\nmonths of light and six of darkness, and where the inhabitants were\r\nvery tall and thin!  They were curious about the price and condition of\r\nhorses and cattle in England. Upon finding out we did not catch our\r\nanimals with the lazo, they cried out, \"Ah, then, you use nothing but\r\nthe bolas:\" the idea of an enclosed country was quite new to them.  The\r\ncaptain at last said, he had one question to ask me, which he should be\r\nvery much obliged if I would answer with all truth.  I trembled to\r\nthink how deeply scientific it would be: it was, \"Whether the ladies of\r\nBuenos Ayres were not the handsomest in the world.\" I replied, like a\r\nrenegade, \"Charmingly so.\" He added, \"I have one other question: Do\r\nladies in any other part of the world wear such large combs?\" I\r\nsolemnly assured him that they did not.  They were absolutely\r\ndelighted.  The captain exclaimed, \"Look there! a man who has seen half\r\nthe world says it is the case; we always thought so, but now we know\r\nit.\" My excellent judgment in combs and beauty procured me a most\r\nhospitable reception; the captain forced me to take his bed, and he\r\nwould sleep on his recado.\r\n\r\n21st.--Started at sunrise, and rode slowly during the whole day.  The\r\ngeological nature of this part of the province was different from the\r\nrest, and closely resembled that of the Pampas.  In consequence, there\r\nwere immense beds of the thistle, as well as of the cardoon: the whole\r\ncountry, indeed, may be called one great bed of these plants.  The two\r\nsorts grow separate, each plant in company with its own kind.  The\r\ncardoon is as high as a horse's back, but the Pampas thistle is often\r\nhigher than the crown of the rider's head.  To leave the road for a\r\nyard is out of the question; and the road itself is partly, and in some\r\ncases entirely closed.  Pasture, of course there is none; if cattle or\r\nhorses once enter the bed, they are for the time completely lost. Hence\r\nit is very hazardous to attempt to drive cattle at this season of the\r\nyear; for when jaded enough to face the thistles, they rush among them,\r\nand are seen no more.  In these districts there are very few estancias,\r\nand these few are situated in the neighbourhood of damp valleys, where\r\nfortunately neither of these overwhelming plants can exist. As night\r\ncame on before we arrived at our journey's end, we slept at a miserable\r\nlittle hovel inhabited by the poorest people.  The extreme though\r\nrather formal courtesy of our host and hostess, considering their grade\r\nof life, was quite delightful.\r\n\r\nNovember 22nd.--Arrived at an estancia on the Berquelo belonging to a\r\nvery hospitable Englishman, to whom I had a letter of introduction from\r\nmy friend Mr. Lumb.  I stayed here three days.  One morning I rode with\r\nmy host to the Sierra del Pedro Flaco, about twenty miles up the Rio\r\nNegro.  Nearly the whole country was covered with good though coarse\r\ngrass, which was as high as a horse's belly; yet there were square\r\nleagues without a single head of cattle. The province of Banda\r\nOriental, if well stocked, would support an astonishing number of\r\nanimals, at present the annual export of hides from Monte Video amounts\r\nto three hundred thousand; and the home consumption, from waste, is\r\nvery considerable.  An \"estanciero\" told me that he often had to send\r\nlarge herds of cattle a long journey to a salting establishment, and\r\nthat the tired beasts were frequently obliged to be killed and skinned;\r\nbut that he could never persuade the Gauchos to eat of them, and every\r\nevening a fresh beast was slaughtered for their suppers!  The view of\r\nthe Rio Negro from the Sierra was more picturesque than any other which\r\nI saw in this province.  The river, broad, deep, and rapid, wound at\r\nthe foot of a rocky precipitous cliff: a belt of wood followed its\r\ncourse, and the horizon terminated in the distant undulations of the\r\nturf-plain.\r\n\r\nWhen in this neighbourhood, I several times heard of the Sierra de las\r\nCuentas: a hill distant many miles to the northward.  The name\r\nsignifies hill of beads.  I was assured that vast numbers of little\r\nround stones, of various colours, each with a small cylindrical hole,\r\nare found there.  Formerly the Indians used to collect them, for the\r\npurpose of making necklaces and bracelets--a taste, I may observe,\r\nwhich is common to all savage nations, as well as to the most polished.\r\nI did not know what to understand from this story, but upon mentioning\r\nit at the Cape of Good Hope to Dr. Andrew Smith, he told me that he\r\nrecollected finding on the south-eastern coast of Africa, about one\r\nhundred miles to the eastward of St.  John's river, some quartz\r\ncrystals with their edges blunted from attrition, and mixed with gravel\r\non the sea-beach.  Each crystal was about five lines in diameter, and\r\nfrom an inch to an inch and a half in length.  Many of them had a small\r\ncanal extending from one extremity to the other, perfectly cylindrical,\r\nand of a size that readily admitted a coarse thread or a piece of fine\r\ncatgut.  Their colour was red or dull white.  The natives were\r\nacquainted with this structure in crystals.  I have mentioned these\r\ncircumstances because, although no crystallized body is at present\r\nknown to assume this form, it may lead some future traveller to\r\ninvestigate the real nature of such stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile staying at this estancia, I was amused with what I saw and heard\r\nof the shepherd-dogs of the country. [3] When riding, it is a common\r\nthing to meet a large flock of sheep guarded by one or two dogs, at the\r\ndistance of some miles from any house or man.  I often wondered how so\r\nfirm a friendship had been established.  The method of education\r\nconsists in separating the puppy, while very young, from the bitch, and\r\nin accustoming it to its future companions. An ewe is held three or\r\nfour times a day for the little thing to suck, and a nest of wool is\r\nmade for it in the sheep-pen; at no time is it allowed to associate\r\nwith other dogs, or with the children of the family.  The puppy is,\r\nmoreover, generally castrated; so that, when grown up, it can scarcely\r\nhave any feelings in common with the rest of its kind.  From this\r\neducation it has no wish to leave the flock, and just as another dog\r\nwill defend its master, man, so will these the sheep.  It is amusing to\r\nobserve, when approaching a flock, how the dog immediately advances\r\nbarking, and the sheep all close in his rear, as if round the oldest\r\nram.  These dogs are also easily taught to bring home the flock, at a\r\ncertain hour in the evening.  Their most troublesome fault, when young,\r\nis their desire of playing with the sheep; for in their sport they\r\nsometimes gallop their poor subjects most unmercifully.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd-dog comes to the house every day for some meat, and as\r\nsoon as it is given him, he skulks away as if ashamed of himself.  On\r\nthese occasions the house-dogs are very tyrannical, and the least of\r\nthem will attack and pursue the stranger.  The minute, however, the\r\nlatter has reached the flock, he turns round and begins to bark, and\r\nthen all the house-dogs take very quickly to their heels.  In a similar\r\nmanner a whole pack of the hungry wild dogs will scarcely ever (and I\r\nwas told by some never) venture to attack a flock guarded by even one\r\nof these faithful shepherds.  The whole account appears to me a curious\r\ninstance of the pliability of the affections in the dog; and yet,\r\nwhether wild or however educated, he has a feeling of respect or fear\r\nfor those that are fulfilling their instinct of association.  For we\r\ncan understand on no principle the wild dogs being driven away by the\r\nsingle one with its flock, except that they consider, from some\r\nconfused notion, that the one thus associated gains power, as if in\r\ncompany with its own kind. F. Cuvier has observed that all animals that\r\nreadily enter into domestication, consider man as a member of their own\r\nsociety, and thus fulfil their instinct of association.  In the above\r\ncase the shepherd-dog ranks the sheep as its fellow-brethren, and thus\r\ngains confidence; and the wild dogs, though knowing that the individual\r\nsheep are not dogs, but are good to eat, yet partly consent to this\r\nview when seeing them in a flock with a shepherd-dog at their head.\r\n\r\nOne evening a \"domidor\" (a subduer of horses) came for the purpose of\r\nbreaking-in some colts.  I will describe the preparatory steps, for I\r\nbelieve they have not been mentioned by other travellers.  A troop of\r\nwild young horses is driven into the corral, or large enclosure of\r\nstakes, and the door is shut.  We will suppose that one man alone has\r\nto catch and mount a horse, which as yet had never felt bridle or\r\nsaddle.  I conceive, except by a Gaucho, such a feat would be utterly\r\nimpracticable.  The Gaucho picks out a full-grown colt; and as the\r\nbeast rushes round the circus he throws his lazo so as to catch both\r\nthe front legs.  Instantly the horse rolls over with a heavy shock, and\r\nwhilst struggling on the ground, the Gaucho, holding the lazo tight,\r\nmakes a circle, so as to catch one of the hind legs just beneath the\r\nfetlock, and draws it close to the two front legs: he then hitches the\r\nlazo, so that the three are bound together.  Then sitting on the\r\nhorse's neck, he fixes a strong bridle, without a bit, to the lower\r\njaw: this he does by passing a narrow thong through the eye-holes at\r\nthe end of the reins, and several times round both jaw and tongue.  The\r\ntwo front legs are now tied closely together with a strong leathern\r\nthong, fastened by a slip-knot.  The lazo, which bound the three\r\ntogether, being then loosed, the horse rises with difficulty.  The\r\nGaucho now holding fast the bridle fixed to the lower jaw, leads the\r\nhorse outside the corral.  If a second man is present (otherwise the\r\ntrouble is much greater) he holds the animal's head, whilst the first\r\nputs on the horsecloths and saddle, and girths the whole together.\r\nDuring this operation, the horse, from dread and astonishment at thus\r\nbeing bound round the waist, throws himself over and over again on the\r\nground, and, till beaten, is unwilling to rise.  At last, when the\r\nsaddling is finished, the poor animal can hardly breathe from fear, and\r\nis white with foam and sweat.  The man now prepares to mount by\r\npressing heavily on the stirrup, so that the horse may not lose its\r\nbalance; and at the moment that he throws his leg over the animal's\r\nback, he pulls the slip-knot binding the front legs, and the beast is\r\nfree.  Some \"domidors\" pull the knot while the animal is lying on the\r\nground, and, standing over the saddle, allow him to rise beneath them.\r\nThe horse, wild with dread, gives a few most violent bounds, and then\r\nstarts off at full gallop: when quite exhausted, the man, by patience,\r\nbrings him back to the corral, where, reeking hot and scarcely alive,\r\nthe poor beast is let free.  Those animals which will not gallop away,\r\nbut obstinately throw themselves on the ground, are by far the most\r\ntroublesome.  This process is tremendously severe, but in two or three\r\ntrials the horse is tamed.  It is not, however, for some weeks that the\r\nanimal is ridden with the iron bit and solid ring, for it must learn to\r\nassociate the will of its rider with the feel of the rein, before the\r\nmost powerful bridle can be of any service.\r\n\r\nAnimals are so abundant in these countries, that humanity and\r\nself-interest are not closely united; therefore I fear it is that the\r\nformer is here scarcely known.  One day, riding in the Pampas with a\r\nvery respectable \"estanciero,\" my horse, being tired, lagged behind.\r\nThe man often shouted to me to spur him.  When I remonstrated that it\r\nwas a pity, for the horse was quite exhausted, he cried out, \"Why\r\nnot?--never mind--spur him--it is my horse.\" I had then some difficulty\r\nin making him comprehend that it was for the horse's sake, and not on\r\nhis account, that I did not choose to use my spurs.  He exclaimed, with\r\na look of great surprise, \"Ah, Don Carlos, que cosa!\" It was clear that\r\nsuch an idea had never before entered his head.\r\n\r\nThe Gauchos are well known to be perfect riders. The idea of being\r\nthrown, let the horse do what it likes; never enters their head.  Their\r\ncriterion of a good rider is, a man who can manage an untamed colt, or\r\nwho, if his horse falls, alights on his own feet, or can perform other\r\nsuch exploits. I have heard of a man betting that he would throw his\r\nhorse down twenty times, and that nineteen times he would not fall\r\nhimself.  I recollect seeing a Gaucho riding a very stubborn horse,\r\nwhich three times successively reared so high as to fall backwards with\r\ngreat violence.  The man judged with uncommon coolness the proper\r\nmoment for slipping off, not an instant before or after the right time;\r\nand as soon as the horse got up, the man jumped on his back, and at\r\nlast they started at a gallop.  The Gaucho never appears to exert any\r\nmuscular force.  I was one day watching a good rider, as we were\r\ngalloping along at a rapid pace, and thought to myself, \"Surely if the\r\nhorse starts, you appear so careless on your seat, you must fall.\" At\r\nthis moment, a male ostrich sprang from its nest right beneath the\r\nhorse's nose: the young colt bounded on one side like a stag; but as\r\nfor the man, all that could be said was, that he started and took\r\nfright with his horse.\r\n\r\nIn Chile and Peru more pains are taken with the mouth of the horse than\r\nin La Plata, and this is evidently a consequence of the more intricate\r\nnature of the country.  In Chile a horse is not considered perfectly\r\nbroken, till he can be brought up standing, in the midst of his full\r\nspeed, on any particular spot,--for instance, on a cloak thrown on the\r\nground: or, again, he will charge a wall, and rearing, scrape the\r\nsurface with his hoofs.  I have seen an animal bounding with spirit,\r\nyet merely reined by a fore-finger and thumb, taken at full gallop\r\nacross a courtyard, and then made to wheel round the post of a veranda\r\nwith great speed, but at so equal a distance, that the rider, with\r\noutstretched arm, all the while kept one finger rubbing the post.  Then\r\nmaking a demi-volte in the air, with the other arm outstretched in a\r\nlike manner, he wheeled round, with astonishing force, in an opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSuch a horse is well broken; and although this at first may appear\r\nuseless, it is far otherwise.  It is only carrying that which is daily\r\nnecessary into perfection.  When a bullock is checked and caught by the\r\nlazo, it will sometimes gallop round and round in a circle, and the\r\nhorse being alarmed at the great strain, if not well broken, will not\r\nreadily turn like the pivot of a wheel.  In consequence many men have\r\nbeen killed; for if the lazo once takes a twist round a man's body, it\r\nwill instantly, from the power of the two opposed animals, almost cut\r\nhim in twain.  On the same principle the races are managed; the course\r\nis only two or three hundred yards long, the wish being to have horses\r\nthat can make a rapid dash.  The race-horses are trained not only to\r\nstand with their hoofs touching a line, but to draw all four feet\r\ntogether, so as at the first spring to bring into play the full action\r\nof the hind-quarters.  In Chile I was told an anecdote, which I believe\r\nwas true; and it offers a good illustration of the use of a well-broken\r\nanimal.  A respectable man riding one day met two others, one of whom\r\nwas mounted on a horse, which he knew to have been stolen from himself.\r\nHe challenged them; they answered him by drawing their sabres and\r\ngiving chase.  The man, on his good and fleet beast, kept just ahead:\r\nas he passed a thick bush he wheeled round it, and brought up his horse\r\nto a dead check.  The pursuers were obliged to shoot on one side and\r\nahead.  Then instantly dashing on, right behind them, he buried his\r\nknife in the back of one, wounded the other, recovered his horse from\r\nthe dying robber, and rode home.  For these feats of horsemanship two\r\nthings are necessary: a most severe bit, like the Mameluke, the power\r\nof which, though seldom used, the horse knows full well; and large\r\nblunt spurs, that can be applied either as a mere touch, or as an\r\ninstrument of extreme pain. I conceive that with English spurs, the\r\nslightest touch of which pricks the skin, it would be impossible to\r\nbreak in a horse after the South American fashion.\r\n\r\nAt an estancia near Las Vacas large numbers of mares are weekly\r\nslaughtered for the sake of their hides, although worth only five paper\r\ndollars, or about half a crown apiece. It seems at first strange that\r\nit can answer to kill mares for such a trifle; but as it is thought\r\nridiculous in this country ever to break in or ride a mare, they are of\r\nno value except for breeding.  The only thing for which I ever saw\r\nmares used, was to tread out wheat from the ear, for which purpose they\r\nwere driven round a circular enclosure, where the wheat-sheaves were\r\nstrewed.  The man employed for slaughtering the mares happened to be\r\ncelebrated for his dexterity with the lazo.  Standing at the distance\r\nof twelve yards from the mouth of the corral, he has laid a wager that\r\nhe would catch by the legs every animal, without missing one, as it\r\nrushed past him.  There was another man who said he would enter the\r\ncorral on foot, catch a mare, fasten her front legs together, drive her\r\nout, throw her down, kill, skin, and stake the hide for drying (which\r\nlatter is a tedious job); and he engaged that he would perform this\r\nwhole operation on twenty-two animals in one day.  Or he would kill and\r\ntake the skin off fifty in the same time.  This would have been a\r\nprodigious task, for it is considered a good day's work to skin and\r\nstake the hides of fifteen or sixteen animals.\r\n\r\nNovember 26th.--I set out on my return in a direct line for Monte\r\nVideo.  Having heard of some giant's bones at a neighbouring farm-house\r\non the Sarandis, a small stream entering the Rio Negro, I rode there\r\naccompanied by my host, and purchased for the value of eighteen pence\r\nthe head of the Toxodon. [4] When found it was quite perfect; but the\r\nboys knocked out some of the teeth with stones, and then set up the\r\nhead as a mark to throw at.  By a most fortunate chance I found a\r\nperfect tooth, which exactly fitted one of the sockets in this skull,\r\nembedded by itself on the banks of the Rio Tercero, at the distance of\r\nabout 180 miles from this place.  I found remains of this extraordinary\r\nanimal at two other places, so that it must formerly have been common.\r\nI found here, also, some large portions of the armour of a gigantic\r\narmadillo-like animal, and part of the great head of a Mylodon.  The\r\nbones of this head are so fresh, that they contain, according to the\r\nanalysis by Mr. T. Reeks, seven per cent of animal matter; and when\r\nplaced in a spirit-lamp, they burn with a small flame.  The number of\r\nthe remains embedded in the grand estuary deposit which forms the\r\nPampas and covers the granitic rocks of Banda Oriental, must be\r\nextraordinarily great.  I believe a straight line drawn in any\r\ndirection through the Pampas would cut through some skeleton or bones.\r\nBesides those which I found during my short excursions, I heard of many\r\nothers, and the origin of such names as \"the stream of the animal,\"\r\n\"the hill of the giant,\" is obvious.  At other times I heard of the\r\nmarvellous property of certain rivers, which had the power of changing\r\nsmall bones into large; or, as some maintained, the bones themselves\r\ngrew.  As far as I am aware, not one of these animals perished, as was\r\nformerly supposed, in the marshes or muddy river-beds of the present\r\nland, but their bones have been exposed by the streams intersecting the\r\nsubaqueous deposit in which they were originally embedded. We may\r\nconclude that the whole area of the Pampas is one wide sepulchre of\r\nthese extinct gigantic quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the day, on the 28th, we arrived at Monte Video,\r\nhaving been two days and a half on the road. The country for the whole\r\nway was of a very uniform character, some parts being rather more rocky\r\nand hilly than near the Plata.  Not far from Monte Video we passed\r\nthrough the village of Las Pietras, so named from some large rounded\r\nmasses of syenite.  Its appearance was rather pretty.  In this country\r\na few fig-trees round a group of houses, and a site elevated a hundred\r\nfeet above the general level, ought always to be called picturesque.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last six months I have had an opportunity of seeing a little\r\nof the character of the inhabitants of these provinces.  The Gauchos,\r\nor countryrmen, are very superior to those who reside in the towns. The\r\nGaucho is invariably most obliging, polite, and hospitable: I did not\r\nmeet with even one instance of rudeness or inhospitality.  He is\r\nmodest, both respecting himself and country, but at the same time a\r\nspirited, bold fellow.  On the other hand, many robberies are\r\ncommitted, and there is much bloodshed: the habit of constantly wearing\r\nthe knife is the chief cause of the latter.  It is lamentable to hear\r\nhow many lives are lost in trifling quarrels.  In fighting, each party\r\ntries to mark the face of his adversary by slashing his nose or eyes;\r\nas is often attested by deep and horrid-looking scars.  Robberies are a\r\nnatural consequence of universal gambling, much drinking, and extreme\r\nindolence.  At Mercedes I asked two men why they did not work.  One\r\ngravely said the days were too long; the other that he was too poor.\r\nThe number of horses and the profusion of food are the destruction of\r\nall industry.  Moreover, there are so many feast-days; and again,\r\nnothing can succeed without it be begun when the moon is on the\r\nincrease; so that half the month is lost from these two causes.\r\n\r\nPolice and justice are quite inefficient.  If a man who is poor commits\r\nmurder and is taken, he will be imprisoned, and perhaps even shot; but\r\nif he is rich and has friends, he may rely on it no very severe\r\nconsequence will ensue. It is curious that the most respectable\r\ninhabitants of the country invariably assist a murderer to escape: they\r\nseem to think that the individual sins against the government, and not\r\nagainst the people.  A traveller has no protection besides his\r\nfire-arms; and the constant habit of carrying them is the main check to\r\nmore frequent robberies. The character of the higher and more educated\r\nclasses who reside in the towns, partakes, but perhaps in a lesser\r\ndegree, of the good parts of the Gaucho, but is, I fear, stained by\r\nmany vices of which he is free.  Sensuality, mockery of all religion,\r\nand the grossest corruption, are far from uncommon.  Nearly every\r\npublic officer can be bribed.  The head man in the post-office sold\r\nforged government franks. The governor and prime minister openly\r\ncombined to plunder the state.  Justice, where gold came into play, was\r\nhardly expected by any one.  I knew an Englishman, who went to the\r\nChief Justice (he told me, that not then understanding the ways of the\r\nplace, he trembled as he entered the room), and said, \"Sir, I have come\r\nto offer you two hundred (paper) dollars (value about five pounds\r\nsterling) if you will arrest before a certain time a man who has\r\ncheated me.  I know it is against the law, but my lawyer (naming him)\r\nrecommended me to take this step.\" The Chief Justice smiled\r\nacquiescence, thanked him, and the man before night was safe in prison.\r\nWith this entire want of principle in many of the leading men, with the\r\ncountry full of ill-paid turbulent officers, the people yet hope that a\r\ndemocratic form of government can succeed!\r\n\r\nOn first entering society in these countries, two or three features\r\nstrike one as particularly remarkable.  The polite and dignified\r\nmanners pervading every rank of life, the excellent taste displayed by\r\nthe women in their dresses, and the equality amongst all ranks.  At the\r\nRio Colorado some men who kept the humblest shops used to dine with\r\nGeneral Rosas.  A son of a major at Bahia Blanca gained his livelihood\r\nby making paper cigars, and he wished to accompany me, as guide or\r\nservant, to Buenos Ayres, but his father objected on the score of the\r\ndanger alone.  Many officers in the army can neither read nor write,\r\nyet all meet in society as equals.  In Entre Rios, the Sala consisted\r\nof only six representatives.  One of them kept a common shop, and\r\nevidently was not degraded by the office.  All this is what would be\r\nexpected in a new country; nevertheless the absence of gentlemen by\r\nprofession appears to an Englishman something strange.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of these countries, the manner in which they have been\r\nbrought up by their unnatural parent, Spain, should always be borne in\r\nmind.  On the whole, perhaps, more credit is due for what has been\r\ndone, than blame for that which may be deficient.  It is impossible to\r\ndoubt but that the extreme liberalism of these countries must\r\nultimately lead to good results.  The very general toleration of\r\nforeign religions, the regard paid to the means of education, the\r\nfreedom of the press, the facilities offered to all foreigners, and\r\nespecially, as I am bound to add, to every one professing the humblest\r\npretensions to science, should be recollected with gratitude by those\r\nwho have visited Spanish South America.\r\n\r\nDecember 6th.--The Beagle sailed from the Rio Plata, never again to\r\nenter its muddy stream.  Our course was directed to Port Desire, on the\r\ncoast of Patagonia.  Before proceeding any further, I will here put\r\ntogether a few observations made at sea.\r\n\r\nSeveral times when the ship has been some miles off the mouth of the\r\nPlata, and at other times when off the shores of Northern Patagonia, we\r\nhave been surrounded by insects. One evening, when we were about ten\r\nmiles from the Bay of San Blas, vast numbers of butterflies, in bands\r\nor flocks of countless myriads, extended as far as the eye could range.\r\nEven by the aid of a telescope it was not possible to see a space free\r\nfrom butterflies.  The seamen cried out \"it was snowing butterflies,\"\r\nand such in fact was the appearance. More species than one were\r\npresent, but the main part belonged to a kind very similar to, but not\r\nidentical with, the common English Colias edusa.  Some moths and\r\nhymenoptera accompanied the butterflies; and a fine beetle (Calosoma)\r\nflew on board.  Other instances are known of this beetle having been\r\ncaught far out at sea; and this is the more remarkable, as the greater\r\nnumber of the Carabidae seldom or never take wing.  The day had been\r\nfine and calm, and the one previous to it equally so, with light and\r\nvariable airs.  Hence we cannot suppose that the insects were blown off\r\nthe land, but we must conclude that they voluntarily took flight.  The\r\ngreat bands of the Colias seem at first to afford an instance like\r\nthose on record of the migrations of another butterfly, Vanessa cardui;\r\n[5] but the presence of other insects makes the case distinct, and even\r\nless intelligible.  Before sunset a strong breeze sprung up from the\r\nnorth, and this must have caused tens of thousands of the butterflies\r\nand other insects to have perished.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, when seventeen miles off Cape Corrientes, I had a\r\nnet overboard to catch pelagic animals. Upon drawing it up, to my\r\nsurprise, I found a considerable number of beetles in it, and although\r\nin the open sea, they did not appear much injured by the salt water.  I\r\nlost some of the specimens, but those which I preserved belonged to the\r\ngenera Colymbetes, Hydroporus, Hydrobius (two species), Notaphus,\r\nCynucus, Adimonia, and Scarabaeus.  At first I thought that these\r\ninsects had been blown from the shore; but upon reflecting that out of\r\nthe eight species four were aquatic, and two others partly so in their\r\nhabits, it appeared to me most probable that they were floated into the\r\nsea by a small stream which drains a lake near Cape Corrientes. On any\r\nsupposition it is an interesting circumstance to find live insects\r\nswimming in the open ocean seventeen miles from the nearest point of\r\nland.  There are several accounts of insects having been blown off the\r\nPatagonian shore.  Captain Cook observed it, as did more lately Captain\r\nKing of the Adventure.  The cause probably is due to the want of\r\nshelter, both of trees and hills, so that an insect on the wing with an\r\noff-shore breeze, would be very apt to be blown out to sea.  The most\r\nremarkable instance I have known of an insect being caught far from the\r\nland, was that of a large grasshopper (Acrydium), which flew on board,\r\nwhen the Beagle was to windward of the Cape de Verd Islands, and when\r\nthe nearest point of land, not directly opposed to the trade-wind, was\r\nCape Blanco on the coast of Africa, 370 miles distant. [6]\r\n\r\nOn several occasions, when the Beagle has been within the mouth of the\r\nPlata, the rigging has been coated with the web of the Gossamer Spider.\r\nOne day (November 1st, 1832) I paid particular attention to this\r\nsubject.  The weather had been fine and clear, and in the morning the\r\nair was full of patches of the flocculent web, as on an autumnal day in\r\nEngland.  The ship was sixty miles distant from the land, in the\r\ndirection of a steady though light breeze.  Vast numbers of a small\r\nspider, about one-tenth of an inch in length, and of a dusky red\r\ncolour, were attached to the webs.  There must have been, I should\r\nsuppose, some thousands on the ship.  The little spider, when first\r\ncoming in contact with the rigging, was always seated on a single\r\nthread, and not on the flocculent mass.  This latter seems merely to be\r\nproduced by the entanglement of the single threads.  The spiders were\r\nall of one species, but of both sexes, together with young ones. These\r\nlatter were distinguished by their smaller size and more dusky colour.\r\nI will not give the description of this spider, but merely state that\r\nit does not appear to me to be included in any of Latreille's genera.\r\nThe little aeronaut as soon as it arrived on board was very active,\r\nrunning about, sometimes letting itself fall, and then reascending the\r\nsame thread; sometimes employing itself in making a small and very\r\nirregular mesh in the corners between the ropes.  It could run with\r\nfacility on the surface of the water.  When disturbed it lifted up its\r\nfront legs, in the attitude of attention.  On its first arrival it\r\nappeared very thirsty, and with exserted maxillae drank eagerly of\r\ndrops of water, this same circumstance has been observed by Strack: may\r\nit not be in consequence of the little insect having passed through a\r\ndry and rarefied atmosphere?  Its stock of web seemed inexhaustible.\r\nWhile watching some that were suspended by a single thread, I several\r\ntimes observed that the slightest breath of air bore them away out of\r\nsight, in a horizontal line.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion (25th) under similar circumstances, I repeatedly\r\nobserved the same kind of small spider, either when placed or having\r\ncrawled on some little eminence, elevate its abdomen, send forth a\r\nthread, and then sail away horizontally, but with a rapidity which was\r\nquite unaccountable.  I thought I could perceive that the spider,\r\nbefore performing the above preparatory steps, connected its legs\r\ntogether with the most delicate threads, but I am not sure whether this\r\nobservation was correct.\r\n\r\nOne day, at St. Fe, I had a better opportunity of observing some\r\nsimilar facts.  A spider which was about three-tenths of an inch in\r\nlength, and which in its general appearance resembled a Citigrade\r\n(therefore quite different from the gossamer), while standing on the\r\nsummit of a post, darted forth four or five threads from its spinners.\r\nThese, glittering in the sunshine, might be compared to diverging rays\r\nof light; they were not, however, straight, but in undulations like\r\nfilms of silk blown by the wind.  They were more than a yard in length,\r\nand diverged in an ascending direction from the orifices.  The spider\r\nthen suddenly let go its hold of the post, and was quickly borne out of\r\nsight.  The day was hot and apparently calm; yet under such\r\ncircumstances, the atmosphere can never be so tranquil as not to affect\r\na vane so delicate as the thread of a spider's web.  If during a warm\r\nday we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a bank, or over\r\na level plain at a distant landmark, the effect of an ascending current\r\nof heated air is almost always evident: such upward currents, it has\r\nbeen remarked, are also shown by the ascent of soap-bubbles, which will\r\nnot rise in an in-doors room.  Hence I think there is not much\r\ndifficulty in understanding the ascent of the fine lines projected from\r\na spider's spinners, and afterwards of the spider itself; the\r\ndivergence of the lines has been attempted to be explained, I believe\r\nby Mr. Murray, by their similar electrical condition. The circumstance\r\nof spiders of the same species, but of different sexes and ages, being\r\nfound on several occasions at the distance of many leagues from the\r\nland, attached in vast numbers to the lines, renders it probable that\r\nthe habit of sailing through the air is as characteristic of this\r\ntribe, as that of diving is of the Argyroneta.  We may then reject\r\nLatreille's supposition, that the gossamer owes its origin\r\nindifferently to the young of several genera of spiders: although, as\r\nwe have seen, the young of other spiders do possess the power of\r\nperforming aerial voyages. [7]\r\n\r\nDuring our different passages south of the Plata, I often towed astern\r\na net made of bunting, and thus caught many curious animals.  Of\r\nCrustacea there were many strange and undescribed genera.  One, which\r\nin some respects is allied to the Notopods (or those crabs which have\r\ntheir posterior legs placed almost on their backs, for the purpose of\r\nadhering to the under side of rocks), is very remarkable from the\r\nstructure of its hind pair of legs.  The penultimate joint, instead of\r\nterminating in a simple claw, ends in three bristle-like appendages of\r\ndissimilar lengths--the longest equalling that of the entire leg. These\r\nclaws are very thin, and are serrated with the finest teeth, directed\r\nbackwards: their curved extremities are flattened, and on this part\r\nfive most minute cups are placed which seem to act in the same manner\r\nas the suckers on the arms of the cuttle-fish.  As the animal lives in\r\nthe open sea, and probably wants a place of rest, I suppose this\r\nbeautiful and most anomalous structure is adapted to take hold of\r\nfloating marine animals.\r\n\r\nIn deep water, far from the land, the number of living creatures is\r\nextremely small: south of the latitude 35 degs., I never succeeded in\r\ncatching anything besides some beroe, and a few species of minute\r\nentomostracous crustacea. In shoaler water, at the distance of a few\r\nmiles from the coast, very many kinds of crustacea and some other\r\nanimals are numerous, but only during the night.  Between latitudes 56\r\nand 57 degs. south of Cape Horn, the net was put astern several times;\r\nit never, however, brought up anything besides a few of two extremely\r\nminute species of Entomostraca. Yet whales and seals, petrels and\r\nalbatross, are exceedingly abundant throughout this part of the ocean.\r\nIt has always been a mystery to me on what the albatross, which lives\r\nfar from the shore, can subsist; I presume that, like the condor, it is\r\nable to fast long; and that one good feast on the carcass of a putrid\r\nwhale lasts for a long time.  The central and intertropical parts of\r\nthe Atlantic swarm with Pteropoda, Crustacea, and Radiata, and with\r\ntheir devourers the flying-fish, and again with their devourers the\r\nbonitos and albicores; I presume that the numerous lower pelagic\r\nanimals feed on the Infusoria, which are now known, from the researches\r\nof Ehrenberg, to abound in the open ocean: but on what, in the clear\r\nblue water, do these Infusoria subsist?\r\n\r\nWhile sailing a little south of the Plata on one very dark night, the\r\nsea presented a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle.  There was a\r\nfresh breeze, and every part of the surface, which during the day is\r\nseen as foam, now glowed with a pale light.  The vessel drove before\r\nher bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was\r\nfollowed by a milky train.  As far as the eye reached, the crest of\r\nevery wave was bright, and the sky above the horizon, from the\r\nreflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure as\r\nover the vault of the heavens.\r\n\r\nAs we proceed further southward the sea is seldom phosphorescent; and\r\noff Cape Horn I do not recollect more than once having seen it so, and\r\nthen it was far from being brilliant.  This circumstance probably has a\r\nclose connection with the scarcity of organic beings in that part of\r\nthe ocean. After the elaborate paper, [8] by Ehrenberg, on the\r\nphosphorescence of the sea, it is almost superfluous on my part to make\r\nany observations on the subject.  I may however add, that the same torn\r\nand irregular particles of gelatinous matter, described by Ehrenberg,\r\nseem in the southern as well as in the northern hemisphere, to be the\r\ncommon cause of this phenomenon.  The particles were so minute as\r\neasily to pass through fine gauze; yet many were distinctly visible by\r\nthe naked eye.  The water when placed in a tumbler and agitated, gave\r\nout sparks, but a small portion in a watch-glass scarcely ever was\r\nluminous.  Ehrenberg states that these particles all retain a certain\r\ndegree of irritability.  My observations, some of which were made\r\ndirectly after taking up the water, gave a different result.  I may\r\nalso mention, that having used the net during one night, I allowed it\r\nto become partially dry, and having occasion twelve hours afterwards to\r\nemploy it again, I found the whole surface sparkled as brightly as when\r\nfirst taken out of the water. It does not appear probable in this case,\r\nthat the particles could have remained so long alive.  On one occasion\r\nhaving kept a jelly-fish of the genus Dianaea till it was dead, the\r\nwater in which it was placed became luminous.  When the waves\r\nscintillate with bright green sparks, I believe it is generally owing\r\nto minute crustacea.  But there can be no doubt that very many other\r\npelagic animals, when alive, are phosphorescent.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions I have observed the sea luminous at considerable\r\ndepths beneath the surface.  Near the mouth of the Plata some circular\r\nand oval patches, from two to four yards in diameter, and with defined\r\noutlines, shone with a steady but pale light; while the surrounding\r\nwater only gave out a few sparks.  The appearance resembled the\r\nreflection of the moon, or some luminous body; for the edges were\r\nsinuous from the undulations of the surface.  The ship, which drew\r\nthirteen feet of water, passed over, without disturbing these patches.\r\nTherefore we must suppose that some animals were congregated together\r\nat a greater depth than the bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\nNear Fernando Noronha the sea gave out light in flashes. The appearance\r\nwas very similar to that which might be expected from a large fish\r\nmoving rapidly through a luminous fluid.  To this cause the sailors\r\nattributed it; at the time, however, I entertained some doubts, on\r\naccount of the frequency and rapidity of the flashes.  I have already\r\nremarked that the phenomenon is very much more common in warm than in\r\ncold countries; and I have sometimes imagined that a disturbed\r\nelectrical condition of the atmosphere was most favourable to its\r\nproduction.  Certainly I think the sea is most luminous after a few\r\ndays of more calm weather than ordinary, during which time it has\r\nswarmed with various animals.  Observing that the water charged with\r\ngelatinous particles is in an impure state, and that the luminous\r\nappearance in all common cases is produced by the agitation of the\r\nfluid in contact with the atmosphere, I am inclined to consider that\r\nthe phosphorescence is the result of the decomposition of the organic\r\nparticles, by which process (one is tempted almost to call it a kind of\r\nrespiration) the ocean becomes purified.\r\n\r\nDecember 23rd.--We arrived at Port Desire, situated in lat. 47 degs.,\r\non the coast of Patagonia.  The creek runs for about twenty miles\r\ninland, with an irregular width.  The Beagle anchored a few miles\r\nwithin the entrance, in front of the ruins of an old Spanish settlement.\r\n\r\nThe same evening I went on shore.  The first landing in any new country\r\nis very interesting, and especially when, as in this case, the whole\r\naspect bears the stamp of a marked and individual character.  At the\r\nheight of between two and three hundred feet above some masses of\r\nporphyry a wide plain extends, which is truly characteristic of\r\nPatagonia. The surface is quite level, and is composed of well-rounded\r\nshingle mixed with a whitish earth.  Here and there scattered tufts of\r\nbrown wiry grass are supported, and still more rarely, some low thorny\r\nbushes.  The weather is dry and pleasant, and the fine blue sky is but\r\nseldom obscured.  When standing in the middle of one of these desert\r\nplains and looking towards the interior, the view is generally bounded\r\nby the escarpment of another plain, rather higher, but equally level\r\nand desolate; and in every other direction the horizon is indistinct\r\nfrom the trembling mirage which seems to rise from the heated surface.\r\n\r\nIn such a country the fate of the Spanish settlement was soon decided;\r\nthe dryness of the climate during the greater part of the year, and the\r\noccasional hostile attacks of the wandering Indians, compelled the\r\ncolonists to desert their half-finished buildings.  The style, however,\r\nin which they were commenced shows the strong and liberal hand of Spain\r\nin the old time.  The result of all the attempts to colonize this side\r\nof America south of 41 degs., has been miserable.  Port Famine\r\nexpresses by its name the lingering and extreme sufferings of several\r\nhundred wretched people, of whom one alone survived to relate their\r\nmisfortunes.  At St. Joseph's Bay, on the coast of Patagonia, a small\r\nsettlement was made; but during one Sunday the Indians made an attack\r\nand massacred the whole party, excepting two men, who remained captives\r\nduring many years.  At the Rio Negro I conversed with one of these men,\r\nnow in extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of Patagonia is as limited as its flora. [9] On the arid\r\nplains a few black beetles (Heteromera) might be seen slowly crawling\r\nabout, and occasionally a lizard darted from side to side.  Of birds we\r\nhave three carrion hawks and in the valleys a few finches and\r\ninsect-feeders.  An ibis (Theristicus melanops--a species said to be\r\nfound in central Africa) is not uncommon on the most desert parts: in\r\ntheir stomachs I found grasshoppers, cicadae, small lizards, and even\r\nscorpions. [10] At one time of the year these birds go in flocks, at\r\nanother in pairs, their cry is very loud and singular, like the\r\nneighing of the guanaco.\r\n\r\nThe guanaco, or wild llama, is the characteristic quadruped of the\r\nplains of Patagonia; it is the South American representative of the\r\ncamel of the East.  It is an elegant animal in a state of nature, with\r\na long slender neck and fine legs.  It is very common over the whole of\r\nthe temperate parts of the continent, as far south as the islands near\r\nCape Horn.  It generally lives in small herds of from half a dozen to\r\nthirty in each; but on the banks of the St. Cruz we saw one herd which\r\nmust have contained at least five hundred.\r\n\r\nThey are generally wild and extremely wary.  Mr. Stokes told me, that\r\nhe one day saw through a glass a herd of these animals which evidently\r\nhad been frightened, and were running away at full speed, although\r\ntheir distance was so great that he could not distinguish them with his\r\nnaked eye.  The sportsman frequently receives the first notice of their\r\npresence, by hearing from a long distance their peculiar shrill\r\nneighing note of alarm.  If he then looks attentively, he will probably\r\nsee the herd standing in a line on the side of some distant hill.  On\r\napproaching nearer, a few more squeals are given, and off they set at\r\nan apparently slow, but really quick canter, along some narrow beaten\r\ntrack to a neighbouring hill.  If, however, by chance he abruptly meets\r\na single animal, or several together, they will generally stand\r\nmotionless and intently gaze at him; then perhaps move on a few yards,\r\nturn round, and look again.  What is the cause of this difference in\r\ntheir shyness?  Do they mistake a man in the distance for their chief\r\nenemy the puma?  Or does curiosity overcome their timidity?  That they\r\nare curious is certain; for if a person lies on the ground, and plays\r\nstrange antics, such as throwing up his feet in the air, they will\r\nalmost always approach by degrees to reconnoitre him.  It was an\r\nartifice that was repeatedly practised by our sportsmen with success,\r\nand it had moreover the advantage of allowing several shots to be\r\nfired, which were all taken as parts of the performance.  On the\r\nmountains of Tierra del Fuego, I have more than once seen a guanaco, on\r\nbeing approached, not only neigh and squeal, but prance and leap about\r\nin the most ridiculous manner, apparently in defiance as a challenge.\r\nThese animals are very easily domesticated, and I have seen some thus\r\nkept in northern Patagonia near a house, though not under any\r\nrestraint.  They are in this state very bold, and readily attack a man\r\nby striking him from behind with both knees.  It is asserted that the\r\nmotive for these attacks is jealousy on account of their females.  The\r\nwild guanacos, however, have no idea of defence; even a single dog will\r\nsecure one of these large animals, till the huntsman can come up.  In\r\nmany of their habits they are like sheep in a flock. Thus when they see\r\nmen approaching in several directions on horseback, they soon become\r\nbewildered, and know not which way to run.  This greatly facilitates\r\nthe Indian method of hunting, for they are thus easily driven to a\r\ncentral point, and are encompassed.\r\n\r\nThe guanacos readily take to the water: several times at Port Valdes\r\nthey were seen swimming from island to island. Byron, in his voyage\r\nsays he saw them drinking salt water. Some of our officers likewise saw\r\na herd apparently drinking the briny fluid from a salina near Cape\r\nBlanco.  I imagine in several parts of the country, if they do not\r\ndrink salt water, they drink none at all.  In the middle of the day\r\nthey frequently roll in the dust, in saucer-shaped hollows.  The males\r\nfight together; two one day passed quite close to me, squealing and\r\ntrying to bite each other; and several were shot with their hides\r\ndeeply scored.  Herds sometimes appear to set out on exploring parties:\r\nat Bahia Blanca, where, within thirty miles of the coast, these animals\r\nare extremely unfrequent, I one day saw the tracks of thirty or forty,\r\nwhich had come in a direct line to a muddy salt-water creek.  They then\r\nmust have perceived that they were approaching the sea, for they had\r\nwheeled with the regularity of cavalry, and had returned back in as\r\nstraight a line as they had advanced. The guanacos have one singular\r\nhabit, which is to me quite inexplicable; namely, that on successive\r\ndays they drop their dung in the same defined heap.  I saw one of these\r\nheaps which was eight feet in diameter, and was composed of a large\r\nquantity.  This habit, according to M. A. d'Orbigny, is common to all\r\nthe species of the genus; it is very useful to the Peruvian Indians,\r\nwho use the dung for fuel, and are thus saved the trouble of collecting\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe guanacos appear to have favourite spots for lying down to die.  On\r\nthe banks of the St. Cruz, in certain circumscribed spaces, which were\r\ngenerally bushy and all near the river, the ground was actually white\r\nwith bones.  On one such spot I counted between ten and twenty heads. I\r\nparticularly examined the bones; they did not appear, as some scattered\r\nones which I had seen, gnawed or broken, as if dragged together by\r\nbeasts of prey.  The animals in most cases must have crawled, before\r\ndying, beneath and amongst the bushes.  Mr. Bynoe informs me that\r\nduring a former voyage he observed the same circumstance on the banks\r\nof the Rio Gallegos.  I do not at all understand the reason of this,\r\nbut I may observe, that the wounded guanacos at the St. Cruz invariably\r\nwalked towards the river.  At St. Jago in the Cape de Verd Islands, I\r\nremember having seen in a ravine a retired corner covered with bones of\r\nthe goat; we at the time exclaimed that it was the burial ground of all\r\nthe goats in the island.  I mention these trifling circumstances,\r\nbecause in certain cases they might explain the occurrence of a number\r\nof uninjured bones in a cave, or buried under alluvial accumulations;\r\nand likewise the cause why certain animals are more commonly embedded\r\nthan others in sedimentary deposits.\r\n\r\nOne day the yawl was sent under the command of Mr. Chaffers with three\r\ndays' provisions to survey the upper part of the harbour.  In the\r\nmorning we searched for some watering-places mentioned in an old\r\nSpanish chart.  We found one creek, at the head of which there was a\r\ntrickling rill (the first we had seen) of brackish water.  Here the\r\ntide compelled us to wait several hours; and in the interval I walked\r\nsome miles into the interior.  The plain as usual consisted of gravel,\r\nmingled with soil resembling chalk in appearance, but very different\r\nfrom it in nature.  From the softness of these materials it was worn\r\ninto many gulleys.  There was not a tree, and, excepting the guanaco,\r\nwhich stood on the hill-top a watchful sentinel over its herd, scarcely\r\nan animal or a bird.  All was stillness and desolation.  Yet in passing\r\nover these scenes, without one bright object near, an ill-defined but\r\nstrong sense of pleasure is vividly excited. One asked how many ages\r\nthe plain had thus lasted, and how many more it was doomed thus to\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\"None can reply--all seems eternal now. The wilderness has a mysterious\r\ntongue, Which teaches awful doubt.\" [11]\r\n\r\nIn the evening we sailed a few miles further up, and then pitched the\r\ntents for the night.  By the middle of the next day the yawl was\r\naground, and from the shoalness of the water could not proceed any\r\nhigher.  The water being found partly fresh, Mr. Chaffers took the\r\ndingey and went up two or three miles further, where she also grounded,\r\nbut in a fresh-water river.  The water was muddy, and though the stream\r\nwas most insignificant in size, it would be difficult to account for\r\nits origin, except from the melting snow on the Cordillera.  At the\r\nspot where we bivouacked, we were surrounded by bold cliffs and steep\r\npinnacles of porphyry.  I do not think I ever saw a spot which appeared\r\nmore secluded from the rest of the world, than this rocky crevice in\r\nthe wide plain.\r\n\r\nThe second day after our return to the anchorage, a party of officers\r\nand myself went to ransack an old Indian grave, which I had found on\r\nthe summit of a neighbouring hill. Two immense stones, each probably\r\nweighing at least a couple of tons, had been placed in front of a ledge\r\nof rock about six feet high.  At the bottom of the grave on the hard\r\nrock there was a layer of earth about a foot deep, which must have been\r\nbrought up from the plain below.  Above it a pavement of flat stones\r\nwas placed, on which others were piled, so as to fill up the space\r\nbetween the ledge and the two great blocks.  To complete the grave, the\r\nIndians had contrived to detach from the ledge a huge fragment, and to\r\nthrow it over the pile so as to rest on the two blocks.  We undermined\r\nthe grave on both sides, but could not find any relics, or even bones.\r\nThe latter probably had decayed long since (in which case the grave\r\nmust have been of extreme antiquity), for I found in another place some\r\nsmaller heaps beneath which a very few crumbling fragments could yet be\r\ndistinguished as having belonged to a man.  Falconer states, that where\r\nan Indian dies he is buried, but that subsequently his bones are\r\ncarefully taken up and carried, let the distance be ever so great, to\r\nbe deposited near the sea-coast.  This custom, I think, may be\r\naccounted for by recollecting, that before the introduction of horses,\r\nthese Indians must have led nearly the same life as the Fuegians now\r\ndo, and therefore generally have resided in the neighbourhood of the\r\nsea. The common prejudice of lying where one's ancestors have lain,\r\nwould make the now roaming Indians bring the less perishable part of\r\ntheir dead to their ancient burial-ground on the coast.\r\n\r\nJanuary 9th, 1834.--Before it was dark the Beagle anchored in the fine\r\nspacious harbour of Port St. Julian, situated about one hundred and ten\r\nmiles to the south of Port Desire. We remained here eight days. The\r\ncountry is nearly similar to that of Port Desire, but perhaps rather\r\nmore sterile.  One day a party accompanied Captain Fitz Roy on a long\r\nwalk round the head of the harbour.  We were eleven hours without\r\ntasting any water, and some of the party were quite exhausted.  From\r\nthe summit of a hill (since well named Thirsty Hill) a fine lake was\r\nspied, and two of the party proceeded with concerted signals to show\r\nwhether it was fresh water.  What was our disappointment to find a\r\nsnow-white expanse of salt, crystallized in great cubes!  We attributed\r\nour extreme thirst to the dryness of the atmosphere; but whatever the\r\ncause might be, we were exceedingly glad late in the evening to get\r\nback to the boats.  Although we could nowhere find, during our whole\r\nvisit, a single drop of fresh water, yet some must exist; for by an odd\r\nchance I found on the surface of the salt water, near the head of the\r\nbay, a Colymbetes not quite dead, which must have lived in some not far\r\ndistant pool.  Three other insects (a Cincindela, like hybrida, a\r\nCymindis, and a Harpalus, which all live on muddy flats occasionally\r\noverflowed by the sea), and one other found dead on the plain, complete\r\nthe list of the beetles.  A good-sized fly (Tabanus) was extremely\r\nnumerous, and tormented us by its painful bite.  The common horsefly,\r\nwhich is so troublesome in the shady lanes of England, belongs to this\r\nsame genus.  We here have the puzzle that so frequently occurs in the\r\ncase of musquitoes--on the blood of what animals do these insects\r\ncommonly feed?  The guanaco is nearly the only warm-blooded quadruped,\r\nand it is found in quite inconsiderable numbers compared with the\r\nmultitude of flies.\r\n\r\nThe geology of Patagonia is interesting.  Differently from Europe,\r\nwhere the tertiary formations appear to have accumulated in bays, here\r\nalong hundreds of miles of coast we have one great deposit, including\r\nmany tertiary shells, all apparently extinct.  The most common shell is\r\na massive gigantic oyster, sometimes even a foot in diameter.  These\r\nbeds are covered by others of a peculiar soft white stone, including\r\nmuch gypsum, and resembling chalk, but really of a pumiceous nature. It\r\nis highly remarkable, from being composed, to at least one-tenth of its\r\nbulk, of Infusoria. Professor Ehrenberg has already ascertained in it\r\nthirty oceanic forms.  This bed extends for 500 miles along the coast,\r\nand probably for a considerably greater distance.  At Port St. Julian\r\nits thickness is more than 800 feet!  These white beds are everywhere\r\ncapped by a mass of gravel, forming probably one of the largest beds of\r\nshingle in the world: it certainly extends from near the Rio Colorado\r\nto between 600 and 700 nautical miles southward, at Santa Cruz (a river\r\na little south of St. Julian), it reaches to the foot of the\r\nCordillera; half way up the river, its thickness is more than 200 feet;\r\nit probably everywhere extends to this great chain, whence the\r\nwell-rounded pebbles of porphyry have been derived: we may consider its\r\naverage breadth as 200 miles, and its average thickness as about 50\r\nfeet.  If this great bed of pebbles, without including the mud\r\nnecessarily derived from their attrition, was piled into a mound, it\r\nwould form a great mountain chain!  When we consider that all these\r\npebbles, countless as the grains of sand in the desert, have been\r\nderived from the slow falling of masses of rock on the old coast-lines\r\nand banks of rivers, and that these fragments have been dashed into\r\nsmaller pieces, and that each of them has since been slowly rolled,\r\nrounded, and far transported the mind is stupefied in thinking over the\r\nlong, absolutely necessary, lapse of years.  Yet all this gravel has\r\nbeen transported, and probably rounded, subsequently to the deposition\r\nof the white beds, and long subsequently to the underlying beds with\r\nthe tertiary shells.\r\n\r\nEverything in this southern continent has been effected on a grand\r\nscale: the land, from the Rio Plata to Tierra del Fuego, a distance of\r\n1200 miles, has been raised in mass (and in Patagonia to a height of\r\nbetween 300 and 400 feet), within the period of the now existing\r\nsea-shells.  The old and weathered shells left on the surface of the\r\nupraised plain still partially retain their colours.  The uprising\r\nmovement has been interrupted by at least eight long periods of rest,\r\nduring which the sea ate, deeply back into the land, forming at\r\nsuccessive levels the long lines of cliffs, or escarpments, which\r\nseparate the different plains as they rise like steps one behind the\r\nother.  The elevatory movement, and the eating-back power of the sea\r\nduring the periods of rest, have been equable over long lines of coast;\r\nfor I was astonished to find that the step-like plains stand at nearly\r\ncorresponding heights at far distant points.  The lowest plain is 90\r\nfeet high; and the highest, which I ascended near the coast, is 950\r\nfeet; and of this, only relics are left in the form of flat\r\ngravel-capped hills.  The upper plain of Santa Cruz slopes up to a\r\nheight of 3000 feet at the foot of the Cordillera.  I have said that\r\nwithin the period of existing sea-shells, Patagonia has been upraised\r\n300 to 400 feet: I may add, that within the period when icebergs\r\ntransported boulders over the upper plain of Santa Cruz, the elevation\r\nhas been at least 1500 feet.  Nor has Patagonia been affected only by\r\nupward movements: the extinct tertiary shells from Port St. Julian and\r\nSanta Cruz cannot have lived, according to Professor E. Forbes, in a\r\ngreater depth of water than from 40 to 250 feet; but they are now\r\ncovered with sea-deposited strata from 800 to 1000 feet in thickness:\r\nhence the bed of the sea, on which these shells once lived, must have\r\nsunk downwards several hundred feet, to allow of the accumulation of\r\nthe superincumbent strata.  What a history of geological changes does\r\nthe simply-constructed coast of Patagonia reveal!\r\n\r\nAt Port St. Julian, [12] in some red mud capping the gravel on the\r\n90-feet plain, I found half the skeleton of the Macrauchenia\r\nPatachonica, a remarkable quadruped, full as large as a camel.  It\r\nbelongs to the same division of the Pachydermata with the rhinoceros,\r\ntapir, and palaeotherium; but in the structure of the bones of its long\r\nneck it shows a clear relation to the camel, or rather to the guanaco\r\nand llama. From recent sea-shells being found on two of the higher\r\nstep-formed plains, which must have been modelled and upraised before\r\nthe mud was deposited in which the Macrauchenia was entombed, it is\r\ncertain that this curious quadruped lived long after the sea was\r\ninhabited by its present shells.  I was at first much surprised how a\r\nlarge quadruped could so lately have subsisted, in lat. 49 degs. 15',\r\non these wretched gravel plains, with their stunted vegetation; but the\r\nrelationship of the Macrauchenia to the Guanaco, now an inhabitant of\r\nthe most sterile parts, partly explains this difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe relationship, though distant, between the Macrauchenia and the\r\nGuanaco, between the Toxodon and the Capybara,--the closer relationship\r\nbetween the many extinct Edentata and the living sloths, ant-eaters,\r\nand armadillos, now so eminently characteristic of South American\r\nzoology,--and the still closer relationship between the fossil and\r\nliving species of Ctenomys and Hydrochaerus, are most interesting\r\nfacts.  This relationship is shown wonderfully--as wonderfully as\r\nbetween the fossil and extinct Marsupial animals of Australia--by the\r\ngreat collection lately brought to Europe from the caves of Brazil by\r\nMM. Lund and Clausen. In this collection there are extinct species of\r\nall the thirty-two genera, excepting four, of the terrestrial\r\nquadrupeds now inhabiting the provinces in which the caves occur; and\r\nthe extinct species are much more numerous than those now living: there\r\nare fossil ant-eaters, armadillos, tapirs, peccaries, guanacos,\r\nopossums, and numerous South American gnawers and monkeys, and other\r\nanimals.  This wonderful relationship in the same continent between the\r\ndead and the living, will, I do not doubt, hereafter throw more light\r\non the appearance of organic beings on our earth, and their\r\ndisappearance from it, than any other class of facts.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reflect on the changed state of the American\r\ncontinent without the deepest astonishment.  Formerly it must have\r\nswarmed with great monsters: now we find mere pigmies, compared with\r\nthe antecedent, allied races.  If Buffon had known of the gigantic\r\nsloth and armadillo-like animals, and of the lost Pachydermata, he\r\nmight have said with a greater semblance of truth that the creative\r\nforce in America had lost its power, rather than that it had never\r\npossessed great vigour.  The greater number, if not all, of these\r\nextinct quadrupeds lived at a late period, and were the contemporaries\r\nof most of the existing sea-shells.  Since they lived, no very great\r\nchange in the form of the land can have taken place.  What, then, has\r\nexterminated so many species and whole genera?  The mind at first is\r\nirresistibly hurried into the belief of some great catastrophe; but\r\nthus to destroy animals, both large and small, in Southern Patagonia,\r\nin Brazil, on the Cordillera of Peru, in North America up to Behring's\r\nStraits, we must shake the entire framework of the globe.  An\r\nexamination, moreover, of the geology of La Plata and Patagonia, leads\r\nto the belief that all the features of the land result from slow and\r\ngradual changes.  It appears from the character of the fossils in\r\nEurope, Asia, Australia, and in North and South America, that those\r\nconditions which favour the life of the _larger_ quadrupeds were lately\r\nco-extensive with the world: what those conditions were, no one has yet\r\neven conjectured.  It could hardly have been a change of temperature,\r\nwhich at about the same time destroyed the inhabitants of tropical,\r\ntemperate, and arctic latitudes on both sides of the globe.  In North\r\nAmerica we positively know from Mr. Lyell, that the large quadrupeds\r\nlived subsequently to that period, when boulders were brought into\r\nlatitudes at which icebergs now never arrive: from conclusive but\r\nindirect reasons we may feel sure, that in the southern hemisphere the\r\nMacrauchenia, also, lived long subsequently to the ice-transporting\r\nboulder-period.  Did man, after his first inroad into South America,\r\ndestroy, as has been suggested, the unwieldy Megatherium and the other\r\nEdentata?  We must at least look to some other cause for the\r\ndestruction of the little tucutuco at Bahia Blanca, and of the many\r\nfossil mice and other small quadrupeds in Brazil.  No one will imagine\r\nthat a drought, even far severer than those which cause such losses in\r\nthe provinces of La Plata, could destroy every individual of every\r\nspecies from Southern Patagonia to Behring's Straits.  What shall we\r\nsay of the extinction of the horse?  Did those plains fail of pasture,\r\nwhich have since been overrun by thousands and hundreds of thousands of\r\nthe descendants of the stock introduced by the Spaniards?  Have the\r\nsubsequently introduced species consumed the food of the great\r\nantecedent races? Can we believe that the Capybara has taken the food\r\nof the Toxodon, the Guanaco of the Macrauchenia, the existing small\r\nEdentata of their numerous gigantic prototypes?  Certainly, no fact in\r\nthe long history of the world is so startling as the wide and repeated\r\nexterminations of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we consider the subject under another point of view,\r\nit will appear less perplexing.  We do not steadily bear in mind, how\r\nprofoundly ignorant we are of the conditions of existence of every\r\nanimal; nor do we always remember, that some check is constantly\r\npreventing the too rapid increase of every organized being left in a\r\nstate of nature.  The supply of food, on an average, remains constant,\r\nyet the tendency in every animal to increase by propagation is\r\ngeometrical; and its surprising effects have nowhere been more\r\nastonishingly shown, than in the case of the European animals run wild\r\nduring the last few centuries in America. Every animal in a state of\r\nnature regularly breeds; yet in a species long established, any _great_\r\nincrease in numbers is obviously impossible, and must be checked by\r\nsome means. We are, nevertheless, seldom able with certainty to tell in\r\nany given species, at what period of life, or at what period of the\r\nyear, or whether only at long intervals, the check falls; or, again,\r\nwhat is the precise nature of the check. Hence probably it is, that we\r\nfeel so little surprise at one, of two species closely allied in\r\nhabits, being rare and the other abundant in the same district; or,\r\nagain, that one should be abundant in one district, and another,\r\nfilling the same place in the economy of nature, should be abundant in\r\na neighbouring district, differing very little in its conditions.  If\r\nasked how this is, one immediately replies that it is determined by\r\nsome slight difference, in climate, food, or the number of enemies: yet\r\nhow rarely, if ever, we can point out the precise cause and manner of\r\naction of the check!  We are therefore, driven to the conclusion, that\r\ncauses generally quite inappreciable by us, determine whether a given\r\nspecies shall be abundant or scanty in numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the cases where we can trace the extinction of a species through\r\nman, either wholly or in one limited district, we know that it becomes\r\nrarer and rarer, and is then lost: it would be difficult to point out\r\nany just distinction [13] between a species destroyed by man or by the\r\nincrease of its natural enemies.  The evidence of rarity preceding\r\nextinction, is more striking in the successive tertiary strata, as\r\nremarked by several able observers; it has often been found that a\r\nshell very common in a tertiary stratum is now most rare, and has even\r\nlong been thought extinct.  If then, as appears probable, species first\r\nbecome rare and then extinct--if the too rapid increase of every\r\nspecies, even the most favoured, is steadily checked, as we must admit,\r\nthough how and when it is hard to say--and if we see, without the\r\nsmallest surprise, though unable to assign the precise reason, one\r\nspecies abundant and another closely allied species rare in the same\r\ndistrict--why should we feel such great astonishment at the rarity\r\nbeing carried one step further to extinction?  An action going on, on\r\nevery side of us, and yet barely appreciable, might surely be carried a\r\nlittle further, without exciting our observation. Who would feel any\r\ngreat surprise at hearing that the Magalonyx was formerly rare compared\r\nwith the Megatherium, or that one of the fossil monkeys was few in\r\nnumber compared with one of the now living monkeys? and yet in this\r\ncomparative rarity, we should have the plainest evidence of less\r\nfavourable conditions for their existence.  To admit that species\r\ngenerally become rare before they become extinct--to feel no surprise\r\nat the comparative rarity of one species with another, and yet to call\r\nin some extraordinary agent and to marvel greatly when a species ceases\r\nto exist, appears to me much the same as to admit that sickness in the\r\nindividual is the prelude to death--to feel no surprise at\r\nsickness--but when the sick man dies to wonder, and to believe that he\r\ndied through violence.\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Waterhouse has drawn up a detailed description of this head,\r\nwhich I hope he will publish in some Journal.\r\n\r\n[2] A nearly similar abnormal, but I do not know whether hereditary,\r\nstructure has been observed in the carp, and likewise in the crocodile\r\nof the Ganges: Histoire des Anomalies, par M. Isid. Geoffroy St.\r\nHilaire, tom. i. p. 244.\r\n\r\n[3] M.

This river is situated about sixty miles south of Port St.\r\nJulian.  During the last voyage Captain Stokes proceeded thirty miles\r\nup it, but then, from the want of provisions, was obliged to return.\r\nExcepting what was discovered at that time, scarcely anything was known\r\nabout this large river.  Captain Fitz Roy now determined to follow its\r\ncourse as far as time would allow.  On the 18th three whale-boats\r\nstarted, carrying three weeks' provisions; and the party consisted of\r\ntwenty-five souls--a force which would have been sufficient to have\r\ndefied a host of Indians.  With a strong flood-tide and a fine day we\r\nmade a good run, soon drank some of the fresh water, and were at night\r\nnearly above the tidal influence.\r\n\r\nThe river here assumed a size and appearance which, even at the highest\r\npoint we ultimately reached, was scarcely diminished.  It was generally\r\nfrom three to four hundred yards broad, and in the middle about\r\nseventeen feet deep.  The rapidity of the current, which in its whole\r\ncourse runs at the rate of from four to six knots an hour, is perhaps\r\nits most remarkable feature.  The water is of a fine blue colour, but\r\nwith a slight milky tinge, and not so transparent as at first sight\r\nwould have been expected.  It flows over a bed of pebbles, like those\r\nwhich compose the beach and the surrounding plains.  It runs in a\r\nwinding course through a valley, which extends in a direct line\r\nwestward.  This valley varies from five to ten miles in breadth; it is\r\nbounded by step-formed terraces, which rise in most parts, one above\r\nthe other, to the height of five hundred feet, and have on the opposite\r\nsides a remarkable correspondence.\r\n\r\nApril 19th.--Against so strong a current it was, of course, quite\r\nimpossible to row or sail: consequently the three boats were fastened\r\ntogether head and stern, two hands left in each, and the rest came on\r\nshore to track.  As the general arrangements made by Captain Fitz Roy\r\nwere very good for facilitating the work of all, and as all had a share\r\nin it, I will describe the system.  The party including every one, was\r\ndivided into two spells, each of which hauled at the tracking line\r\nalternately for an hour and a half.  The officers of each boat lived\r\nwith, ate the same food, and slept in the same tent with their crew, so\r\nthat each boat was quite independent of the others.  After sunset the\r\nfirst level spot where any bushes were growing, was chosen for our\r\nnight's lodging.  Each of the crew took it in turns to be cook.\r\nImmediately the boat was hauled up, the cook made his fire; two others\r\npitched the tent; the coxswain handed the things out of the boat; the\r\nrest carried them up to the tents and collected firewood.  By this\r\norder, in half an hour everything was ready for the night.  A watch of\r\ntwo men and an officer was always kept, whose duty it was to look after\r\nthe boats, keep up the fire, and guard against Indians. Each in the\r\nparty had his one hour every night.\r\n\r\nDuring this day we tracked but a short distance, for there were many\r\nislets, covered by thorny bushes, and the channels between them were\r\nshallow.\r\n\r\nApril 20th.--We passed the islands and set to work.  Our regular day's\r\nmarch, although it was hard enough, carried us on an average only ten\r\nmiles in a straight line, and perhaps fifteen or twenty altogether.\r\nBeyond the place where we slept last night, the country is completely\r\n_terra incognita_, for it was there that Captain Stokes turned back. We\r\nsaw in the distance a great smoke, and found the skeleton of a horse,\r\nso we knew that Indians were in the neighbourhood. On the next morning\r\n(21st) tracks of a party of horse and marks left by the trailing of the\r\nchuzos, or long spears, were observed on the ground. It was generally\r\nthought that the Indians had reconnoitred us during the night. Shortly\r\nafterwards we came to a spot where, from the fresh footsteps of men,\r\nchildren, and horses, it was evident that the party had crossed the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nApril 22nd.--The country remained the same, and was extremely\r\nuninteresting.  The complete similarity of the productions throughout\r\nPatagonia is one of its most striking characters.  The level plains of\r\narid shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants; and in the\r\nvalleys the same thorn-bearing bushes grow.  Everywhere we see the same\r\nbirds and insects.  Even the very banks of the river and of the clear\r\nstreamlets which entered it, were scarcely enlivened by a brighter tint\r\nof green.  The curse of sterility is on the land, and the water flowing\r\nover a bed of pebbles partakes of the same curse.  Hence the number of\r\nwater-fowls is very scanty; for there is nothing to support life in the\r\nstream of this barren river.\r\n\r\nPatagonia, poor as she is in some respects, can however boast of a\r\ngreater stock of small rodents [1] than perhaps any other country in\r\nthe world.  Several species of mice are externally characterized by\r\nlarge thin ears and a very fine fur.  These little animals swarm\r\namongst the thickets in the valleys, where they cannot for months\r\ntogether taste a drop of water excepting the dew.  They all seem to be\r\ncannibals for no sooner was a mouse caught in one of my traps that it\r\nwas devoured by others.  A small and delicately shaped fox, which is\r\nlikewise very abundant, probably derives its entire support from these\r\nsmall animals.  The guanaco is also in his proper district, herds of\r\nfifty or a hundred were common; and, as I have stated, we saw one which\r\nmust have contained at least five hundred.  The puma, with the condor\r\nand other carrion-hawks in its train, follows and preys upon these\r\nanimals.  The footsteps of the puma were to be seen almost everywhere\r\non the banks of the river; and the remains of several guanacos, with\r\ntheir necks dislocated and bones broken, showed how they had met their\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nApril 24th.--Like the navigators of old when approaching an unknown\r\nland, we examined and watched for the most trivial sign of a change.\r\nThe drifted trunk of a tree, or a boulder of primitive rock, was hailed\r\nwith joy, as if we had seen a forest growing on the flanks of the\r\nCordillera.  The top, however, of a heavy bank of clouds, which\r\nremained almost constantly in one position, was the most promising\r\nsign, and eventually turned out a true harbinger.  At first the clouds\r\nwere mistaken for the mountains themselves, instead of the masses of\r\nvapour condensed by their icy summits.\r\n\r\nApril 26th.--We this day met with a marked change in the geological\r\nstructure of the plains.  From the first starting I had carefully\r\nexamined the gravel in the river, and for the two last days had noticed\r\nthe presence of a few small pebbles of a very cellular basalt.  These\r\ngradually increased in number and in size, but none were as large as a\r\nman's head.  This morning, however, pebbles of the same rock, but more\r\ncompact, suddenly became abundant, and in the course of half an hour we\r\nsaw, at the distance of five of six miles, the angular edge of a great\r\nbasaltic platform. When we arrived at its base we found the stream\r\nbubbling among the fallen blocks.  For the next twenty-eight miles the\r\nriver-course was encumbered with these basaltic masses. Above that\r\nlimit immense fragments of primitive rocks, derived from its\r\nsurrounding boulder-formation, were equally numerous.  None of the\r\nfragments of any considerable size had been washed more than three or\r\nfour miles down the river below their parent-source: considering the\r\nsingular rapidity of the great body of water in the Santa Cruz, and\r\nthat no still reaches occur in any part, this example is a most\r\nstriking one, of the inefficiency of rivers in transporting even\r\nmoderately-sized fragments.\r\n\r\nThe basalt is only lava, which has flowed beneath the sea; but the\r\neruptions must have been on the grandest scale.  At the point where we\r\nfirst met this formation it was 120 feet in thickness; following up the\r\nriver course, the surface imperceptibly rose and the mass became\r\nthicker, so that at forty miles above the first station it was 320 feet\r\nthick. What the thickness may be close to the Cordillera, I have no\r\nmeans of knowing, but the platform there attains a height of about\r\nthree thousand feet above the level of the sea; we must therefore look\r\nto the mountains of that great chain for its source; and worthy of such\r\na source are streams that have flowed over the gently inclined bed of\r\nthe sea to a distance of one hundred miles.  At the first glance of the\r\nbasaltic cliffs on the opposite sides of the valley, it was evident\r\nthat the strata once were united.  What power, then, has removed along\r\na whole line of country, a solid mass of very hard rock, which had an\r\naverage thickness of nearly three hundred feet, and a breadth varying\r\nfrom rather less than two miles to four miles?  The river, though it\r\nhas so little power in transporting even inconsiderable fragments, yet\r\nin the lapse of ages might produce by its gradual erosion an effect of\r\nwhich it is difficult to judge the amount.  But in this case,\r\nindependently of the insignificance of such an agency, good reasons can\r\nbe assigned for believing that this valley was formerly occupied by an\r\narm of the sea.  It is needless in this work to detail the arguments\r\nleading to this conclusion, derived from the form and the nature of the\r\nstep-formed terraces on both sides of the valley, from the manner in\r\nwhich the bottom of the valley near the Andes expands into a great\r\nestuary-like plain with sand-hillocks on it, and from the occurrence of\r\na few sea-shells lying in the bed of the river.  If I had space I could\r\nprove that South America was formerly here cut off by a strait, joining\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific oceans, like that of Magellan. But it may yet\r\nbe asked, how has the solid basalt been moved?  Geologists formerly\r\nwould have brought into play the violent action of some overwhelming\r\ndebacle; but in this case such a supposition would have been quite\r\ninadmissible, because, the same step-like plains with existing\r\nsea-shells lying on their surface, which front the long line of the\r\nPatagonian coast, sweep up on each side of the valley of Santa Cruz. No\r\npossible action of any flood could thus have modelled the land, either\r\nwithin the valley or along the open coast; and by the formation of such\r\nstep-like plains or terraces the valley itself had been hollowed out.\r\nAlthough we know that there are tides, which run within the Narrows of\r\nthe Strait of Magellan at the rate of eight knots an hour, yet we must\r\nconfess that it makes the head almost giddy to reflect on the number of\r\nyears, century after century, which the tides, unaided by a heavy surf,\r\nmust have required to have corroded so vast an area and thickness of\r\nsolid basaltic lava.  Nevertheless, we must believe that the strata\r\nundermined by the waters of this ancient strait, were broken up into\r\nhuge fragments, and these lying scattered on the beach were reduced\r\nfirst to smaller blocks, then to pebbles and lastly to the most\r\nimpalpable mud, which the tides drifted far into the Eastern or Western\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\nWith the change in the geological structure of the plains the character\r\nof the landscape likewise altered.  While rambling up some of the\r\nnarrow and rocky defiles, I could almost have fancied myself\r\ntransported back again to the barren valleys of the island of St. Jago.\r\nAmong the basaltic cliffs I found some plants which I had seen nowhere\r\nelse, but others I recognised as being wanderers from Tierra del Fuego.\r\nThese porous rocks serve as a reservoir for the scanty rain-water; and\r\nconsequently on the line where the igneous and sedimentary formations\r\nunite, some small springs (most rare occurrences in Patagonia) burst\r\nforth; and they could be distinguished at a distance by the\r\ncircumscribed patches of bright green herbage.\r\n\r\nApril 27th.--The bed of the river became rather narrower and hence the\r\nstream more rapid.  It here ran at the rate of six knots an hour. From\r\nthis cause, and from the many great angular fragments, tracking the\r\nboats became both dangerous and laborious.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis day I shot a condor.  It measured from tip to tip of the wings,\r\neight and a half feet, and from beak to tail, four feet.  This bird is\r\nknown to have a wide geographical range, being found on the west coast\r\nof South America, from the Strait of Magellan along the Cordillera as\r\nfar as eight degrees north of the equator.  The steep cliff near the\r\nmouth of the Rio Negro is its northern limit on the Patagonian coast;\r\nand they have there wandered about four hundred miles from the great\r\ncentral line of their habitations in the Andes.  Further south, among\r\nthe bold precipices at the head of Port Desire, the condor is not\r\nuncommon; yet only a few stragglers occasionally visit the sea-coast. A\r\nline of cliff near the mouth of the Santa Cruz is frequented by these\r\nbirds, and about eighty miles up the river, where the sides of the\r\nvalley are formed by steep basaltic precipices, the condor reappears.\r\nFrom these facts it seems that the condors require perpendicular\r\ncliffs.  In Chile, they haunt, during the greater part of the year, the\r\nlower country near the shores of the Pacific, and at night several\r\nroost together in one tree; but in the early part of summer, they\r\nretire to the most inaccessible parts of the inner Cordillera, there to\r\nbreed in peace.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their propagation, I was told by the country people in\r\nChile, that the condor makes no sort of nest, but in the months of\r\nNovember and December lays two large white eggs on a shelf of bare\r\nrock.  It is said that the young condors cannot fly for an entire year;\r\nand long after they are able, they continue to roost by night, and hunt\r\nby day with their parents.  The old birds generally live in pairs; but\r\namong the inland basaltic cliffs of the Santa Cruz, I found a spot,\r\nwhere scores must usually haunt.  On coming suddenly to the brow of the\r\nprecipice, it was a grand spectacle to see between twenty and thirty of\r\nthese great birds start heavily from their resting-place, and wheel\r\naway in majestic circles.  From the quantity of dung on the rocks they\r\nmust long have frequented this cliff for roosting and breeding.  Having\r\ngorged themselves with carrion on the plains below, they retire to\r\nthese favourite ledges to digest their food.  From these facts, the\r\ncondor, like the gallinazo, must to a certain degree be considered as a\r\ngregarious bird. In this part of the country they live altogether on\r\nthe guanacos which have died a natural death, or as more commonly\r\nhappens, have been killed by the pumas.  I believe, from what I saw in\r\nPatagonia, that they do not on ordinary occasions extend their daily\r\nexcursions to any great distance from their regular sleeping-places.\r\n\r\nThe condors may oftentimes be seen at a great height, soaring over a\r\ncertain spot in the most graceful circles. On some occasions I am sure\r\nthat they do this only for pleasure, but on others, the Chileno\r\ncountryman tells you that they are watching a dying animal, or the puma\r\ndevouring its prey.  If the condors glide down, and then suddenly all\r\nrise together, the Chileno knows that it is the puma which, watching\r\nthe carcass, has sprung out to drive away the robbers.  Besides feeding\r\non carrion, the condors frequently attack young goats and lambs; and\r\nthe shepherd-dogs are trained, whenever they pass over, to run out, and\r\nlooking upwards to bark violently.  The Chilenos destroy and catch\r\nnumbers.  Two methods are used; one is to place a carcass on a level\r\npiece of ground within an enclosure of sticks with an opening, and when\r\nthe condors are gorged to gallop up on horseback to the entrance, and\r\nthus enclose them: for when this bird has not space to run, it cannot\r\ngive its body sufficient momentum to rise from the ground. The second\r\nmethod is to mark the trees in which, frequently to the number of five\r\nor six together, they roost, and they at night to climb up and noose\r\nthem.  They are such heavy sleepers, as I have myself witnessed, that\r\nthis is not a difficult task.  At Valparaiso, I have seen a living\r\ncondor sold for sixpence, but the common price is eight or ten\r\nshillings. One which I saw brought in, had been tied with rope, and was\r\nmuch injured; yet, the moment the line was cut by which its bill was\r\nsecured, although surrounded by people, it began ravenously to tear a\r\npiece of carrion.  In a garden at the same place, between twenty and\r\nthirty were kept alive. They were fed only once a week, but they\r\nappeared in pretty good health. [2] The Chileno countrymen assert that\r\nthe condor will live, and retain its vigour, between five and six weeks\r\nwithout eating: I cannot answer for the truth of this, but it is a\r\ncruel experiment, which very likely has been tried.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is killed in the country, it is well known that the\r\ncondors, like other carrion-vultures, soon gain intelligence of it, and\r\ncongregate in an inexplicable manner. In most cases it must not be\r\noverlooked, that the birds have discovered their prey, and have picked\r\nthe skeleton clean, before the flesh is in the least degree tainted.\r\nRemembering the experiments of M. Audubon, on the little smelling\r\npowers of carrion-hawks, I tried in the above mentioned garden the\r\nfollowing experiment: the condors were tied, each by a rope, in a long\r\nrow at the bottom of a wall; and having folded up a piece of meat in\r\nwhite paper, I walked backwards and forwards, carrying it in my hand at\r\nthe distance of about three yards from them, but no notice whatever was\r\ntaken.  I then threw it on the ground, within one yard of an old male\r\nbird; he looked at it for a moment with attention, but then regarded it\r\nno more.  With a stick I pushed it closer and closer, until at last he\r\ntouched it with his beak; the paper was then instantly torn off with\r\nfury, and at the same moment, every bird in the long row began\r\nstruggling and flapping its wings.  Under the same circumstances, it\r\nwould have been quite impossible to have deceived a dog.  The evidence\r\nin favour of and against the acute smelling powers of carrion-vultures\r\nis singularly balanced. Professor Owen has demonstrated that the\r\nolfactory nerves of the turkey-buzzard (Cathartes aura) are highly\r\ndeveloped, and on the evening when Mr. Owen's paper was read at the\r\nZoological Society, it was mentioned by a gentleman that he had seen\r\nthe carrion-hawks in the West Indies on two occasions collect on the\r\nroof of a house, when a corpse had become offensive from not having\r\nbeen buried, in this case, the intelligence could hardly have been\r\nacquired by sight.  On the other hand, besides the experiments of\r\nAudubon and that one by myself, Mr. Bachman has tried in the United\r\nStates many varied plans, showing that neither the turkey-buzzard (the\r\nspecies dissected by Professor Owen) nor the gallinazo find their food\r\nby smell.  He covered portions of highly-offensive offal with a thin\r\ncanvas cloth, and strewed pieces of meat on it: these the\r\ncarrion-vultures ate up, and then remained quietly standing, with their\r\nbeaks within the eighth of an inch of the putrid mass, without\r\ndiscovering it.  A small rent was made in the canvas, and the offal was\r\nimmediately discovered; the canvas was replaced by a fresh piece, and\r\nmeat again put on it, and was again devoured by the vultures without\r\ntheir discovering the hidden mass on which they were trampling.  These\r\nfacts are attested by the signatures of six gentlemen, besides that of\r\nMr. Bachman. [3]\r\n\r\nOften when lying down to rest on the open plains, on looking upwards, I\r\nhave seen carrion-hawks sailing through the air at a great height.\r\nWhere the country is level I do not believe a space of the heavens, of\r\nmore than fifteen degrees above the horizon, is commonly viewed with\r\nany attention by a person either walking or on horseback.  If such be\r\nthe case, and the vulture is on the wing at a height of between three\r\nand four thousand feet, before it could come within the range of\r\nvision, its distance in a straight line from the beholder's eye, would\r\nbe rather more than two British miles.  Might it not thus readily be\r\noverlooked? When an animal is killed by the sportsman in a lonely\r\nvalley, may he not all the while be watched from above by the\r\nsharp-sighted bird?  And will not the manner of its descend proclaim\r\nthroughout the district to the whole family of carrion-feeders, that\r\ntheir prey is at hand?\r\n\r\nWhen the condors are wheeling in a flock round and round any spot,\r\ntheir flight is beautiful.  Except when rising from the ground, I do\r\nnot recollect ever having seen one of these birds flap its wings.  Near\r\nLima, I watched several for nearly half an hour, without once taking\r\noff my eyes, they moved in large curves, sweeping in circles,\r\ndescending and ascending without giving a single flap.  As they glided\r\nclose over my head, I intently watched from an oblique position, the\r\noutlines of the separate and great terminal feathers of each wing; and\r\nthese separate feathers, if there had been the least vibratory\r\nmovement, would have appeared as if blended together; but they were\r\nseen distinct against the blue sky.  The head and neck were moved\r\nfrequently, and apparently with force; and the extended wings seemed to\r\nform the fulcrum on which the movements of the neck, body, and tail\r\nacted.  If the bird wished to descend, the wings were for a moment\r\ncollapsed; and when again expanded with an altered inclination, the\r\nmomentum gained by the rapid descent seemed to urge the bird upwards\r\nwith the even and steady movement of a paper kite.  In the case of any\r\nbird soaring, its motion must be sufficiently rapid so that the action\r\nof the inclined surface of its body on the atmosphere may\r\ncounterbalance its gravity.  The force to keep up the momentum of a\r\nbody moving in a horizontal plane in the air (in which there is so\r\nlittle friction) cannot be great, and this force is all that is wanted.\r\nThe movements of the neck and body of the condor, we must suppose, is\r\nsufficient for this.  However this may be, it is truly wonderful and\r\nbeautiful to see so great a bird, hour after hour, without any apparent\r\nexertion, wheeling and gliding over mountain and river.\r\n\r\nApril 29th.--From some high land we hailed with joy the white summits\r\nof the Cordillera, as they were seen occasionally peeping through their\r\ndusky envelope of clouds. During the few succeeding days we continued\r\nto get on slowly, for we found the river-course very tortuous, and\r\nstrewed with immense fragments of various ancient slate rocks, and of\r\ngranite.  The plain bordering the valley has here attained an elevation\r\nof about 1100 feet above the river, and its character was much altered.\r\nThe well-rounded pebbles of porphyry were mingled with many immense\r\nangular fragments of basalt and of primary rocks.  The first of these\r\nerratic boulders which I noticed, was sixty-seven miles distant from\r\nthe nearest mountain; another which I measured was five yards square,\r\nand projected five feet above the gravel.  Its edges were so angular,\r\nand its size so great, that I at first mistook it for a rock _in situ_,\r\nand took out my compass to observe the direction of its cleavage.  The\r\nplain here was not quite so level as that nearer the coast, but yet in\r\nbetrayed no signs of any great violence.  Under these circumstances it\r\nis, I believe, quite impossible to explain the transportal of these\r\ngigantic masses of rock so many miles from their parent-source, on any\r\ntheory except by that of floating icebergs.\r\n\r\nDuring the two last days we met with signs of horses, and with several\r\nsmall articles which had belonged to the Indians--such as parts of a\r\nmantle and a bunch of ostrich feathers--, but they appeared to have\r\nbeen lying long on the ground. Between the place where the Indians had\r\nso lately crossed the river and this neighbourhood, though so many\r\nmiles apart, the country appears to be quite unfrequented.  At first,\r\nconsidering the abundance of the guanacos, I was surprised at this; but\r\nit is explained by the stony nature of the plains, which would soon\r\ndisable an unshod horse from taking part in the chase.  Nevertheless,\r\nin two places in this very central region, I found small heaps of\r\nstones, which I do not think could have been accidentally thrown\r\ntogether.  They were placed on points, projecting over the edge of the\r\nhighest lava cliff, and they resembled, but on a small scale, those\r\nnear Port Desire.\r\n\r\nMay 4th.--Captain Fitz Roy determined to take the boats no higher. The\r\nriver had a winding course, and was very rapid; and the appearance of\r\nthe country offered no temptation to proceed any further. Everywhere we\r\nmet with the same productions, and the same dreary landscape.  We were\r\nnow one hundred and forty miles distant from the Atlantic and about\r\nsixty from the nearest arm of the Pacific.  The valley in this upper\r\npart expanded into a wide basin, bounded on the north and south by the\r\nbasaltic platforms, and fronted by the long range of the snow-clad\r\nCordillera.  But we viewed these grand mountains with regret, for we\r\nwere obliged to imagine their nature and productions, instead of\r\nstanding, as we had hoped, on their summits. Besides the useless loss\r\nof time which an attempt to ascend the river and higher would have cost\r\nus, we had already been for some days on half allowance of bread. This,\r\nalthough really enough for reasonable men, was, after a hard day's\r\nmarch, rather scanty food: a light stomach and an easy digestion are\r\ngood things to talk about, but very unpleasant in practice.\r\n\r\n5th.--Before sunrise we commenced our descent.  We shot down the stream\r\nwith great rapidity, generally at the rate of ten knots an hour. In\r\nthis one day we effected what had cost us five-and-a-half hard days'\r\nlabour in ascending. On the 8th, we reached the Beagle after our\r\ntwenty-one days' expedition.  Every one, excepting myself, had cause to\r\nbe dissatisfied; but to me the ascent afforded a most interesting\r\nsection of the great tertiary formation of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nOn March 1st, 1833, and again on March 16th, 1834, the Beagle anchored\r\nin Berkeley Sound, in East Falkland Island. This archipelago is\r\nsituated in nearly the same latitude with the mouth of the Strait of\r\nMagellan; it covers a space of one hundred and twenty by sixty\r\ngeographical miles, and is little more than half the size of Ireland.\r\nAfter the possession of these miserable islands had been contested by\r\nFrance, Spain, and England, they were left uninhabited.  The government\r\nof Buenos Ayres then sold them to a private individual, but likewise\r\nused them, as old Spain had done before, for a penal settlement.\r\nEngland claimed her right and seized them.  The Englishman who was left\r\nin charge of the flag was consequently murdered.  A British officer was\r\nnext sent, unsupported by any power: and when we arrived, we found him\r\nin charge of a population, of which rather more than half were runaway\r\nrebels and murderers.\r\n\r\nThe theatre is worthy of the scenes acted on it.  An undulating land,\r\nwith a desolate and wretched aspect, is everywhere covered by a peaty\r\nsoil and wiry grass, of one monotonous brown colour.  Here and there a\r\npeak or ridge of grey quartz rock breaks through the smooth surface\r\nEvery one has heard of the climate of these regions; it may be compared\r\nto that which is experienced at the height of between one and two\r\nthousand feet, on the mountains of North Wales; having however less\r\nsunshine and less frost but more wind and rain. [4]\r\n\r\n16th.--I will now describe a short excursion which made round a part of\r\nthis island.  In the morning I started with six horses and two Gauchos:\r\nthe latter were capital men for the purpose, and well accustomed to\r\nliving on their own resources.  The weather was very boisterous and\r\ncold with heavy hail-storms.  We got on, however, pretty well but,\r\nexcept the geology, nothing could be less interesting than our day's\r\nride.  The country is uniformly the same undulating moorland; the\r\nsurface being covered by light brown withered grass and a few very\r\nsmall shrubs, all springing out of an elastic peaty soil.  In the\r\nvalleys here and there might be seen a small flock of wild geese, and\r\neverywhere the ground was so soft that the snipe were able to feed.\r\nBesides these two birds there were few others. There is one main range\r\nof hills, nearly two thousand feet in height, and composed of quartz\r\nrock, the rugged and barren crests of which gave us some trouble to\r\ncross.  On the south side we came to the best country for wild cattle;\r\nwe met, however, no great number, for they had been lately much\r\nharassed.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we came across a small herd.  One of my companions, St.\r\nJago by name, soon separated a fat cow: he threw the bolas, and it\r\nstruck her legs, but failed in becoming entangled.  Then dropping his\r\nhat to mark the spot where the balls were left, while at full gallop,\r\nhe uncoiled his lazo, and after a most severe chase, again came up to\r\nthe cow, and caught her round the horns.  The other Gaucho had gone on\r\nahead with the spare horses, so that St. Jago had some difficulty in\r\nkilling the furious beast.  He managed to get her on a level piece of\r\nground, by taking advantage of her as often as she rushed at him; and\r\nwhen she would not move, my horse, from having been trained, would\r\ncanter up, and with his chest give her a violent push.  But when on\r\nlevel ground it does not appear an easy job for one man to kill a beast\r\nmad with terror.  Nor would it be so, if the horse, when left to itself\r\nwithout its rider, did not soon learn, for its own safety, to keep the\r\nlazo tight, so that, if the cow or ox moves forward, the horse moves\r\njust as quickly forward; otherwise, it stands motionless leaning on one\r\nside.  This horse, however, was a young one, and would not stand still,\r\nbut gave in to the cow as she struggled.  It was admirable to see with\r\nwhat dexterity St. Jago dodged behind the beast, till at last he\r\ncontrived to give the fatal touch to the main tendon of the hind leg\r\nafter which, without much difficulty, he drove his knife into the head\r\nof the spinal marrow, and the cow dropped as if struck by lightning. He\r\ncut off pieces of flesh with the skin to it, but without any bones,\r\nsufficient for our expedition.  We then rode on to our sleeping-place,\r\nand had for supper \"carne con cuero,\" or meat roasted with the skin on\r\nit.  This is as superior to common beef as venison is to mutton.  A\r\nlarge circular piece taken from the back is roasted on the embers with\r\nthe hide downwards and is the form of a saucer, so that none of the\r\ngravy is lost. If any worthy alderman had supped with us that evening,\r\n\"carne con cuero,\" without doubt, would soon have been celebrated in\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nDuring the night it rained, and the next day (17th) was very stormy,\r\nwith much hail and snow.  We rode across the island to the neck of land\r\nwhich joins the Rincon del Toro (the great peninsula at the S. W.\r\nextremity) to the rest of the island.  From the great number of cows\r\nwhich have been killed, there is a large proportion of bulls.  These\r\nwander about single, or two and three together, and are very savage.  I\r\nnever saw such magnificent beasts; they equalled in the size of their\r\nhuge heads and necks the Grecian marble sculptures.  Capt. Sulivan\r\ninforms me that the hide of an average-sized bull weighs forty-seven\r\npounds, whereas a hide of this weight, less thoroughly dried, is\r\nconsidered as a very heavy one at Monte Video.  The young bulls\r\ngenerally run away, for a short distance; but the old ones do not stir\r\na step, except to rush at man and horse; and many horses have been thus\r\nkilled.  An old bull crossed a boggy stream, and took his stand on the\r\nopposite side to us; we in vain tried to drive him away, and failing,\r\nwere obliged to make a large circuit.  The Gauchos in revenge\r\ndetermined to emasculate him and render him for the future harmless. It\r\nwas very interesting to see how art completely mastered force.  One\r\nlazo was thrown over his horns as he rushed at the horse, and another\r\nround his hind legs: in a minute the monster was stretched powerless on\r\nthe ground. After the lazo has once been drawn tightly round the horns\r\nof a furious animal, it does not at first appear an easy thing to\r\ndisengage it again without killing the beast: nor, I apprehend, would\r\nit be so if the man was by himself.  By the aid, however, of a second\r\nperson throwing his lazo so as to catch both hind legs, it is quickly\r\nmanaged: for the animal, as long as its hind legs are kept\r\noutstretched, is quite helpless, and the first man can with his hands\r\nloosen his lazo from the horns, and then quietly mount his horse; but\r\nthe moment the second man, by backing ever so little, relaxes the\r\nstrain, the lazo slips off the legs of the struggling beast, which then\r\nrises free, shakes himself, and vainly rushes at his antagonist.\r\n\r\nDuring our whole ride we saw only one troop of wild horses.  These\r\nanimals, as well as the cattle, were introduced by the French in 1764,\r\nsince which time both have greatly increased.  It is a curious fact,\r\nthat the horses have never left the eastern end of the island, although\r\nthere is no natural boundary to prevent them from roaming, and that\r\npart of the island is not more tempting than the rest.  The Gauchos\r\nwhom I asked, though asserting this to be the case, were unable to\r\naccount for it, except from the strong attachment which horses have to\r\nany locality to which they are accustomed.  Considering that the island\r\ndoes not appear fully stocked, and that there are no beasts of prey, I\r\nwas particularly curious to know what has checked their originally\r\nrapid increase.  That in a limited island some check would sooner or\r\nlater supervene, is inevitable; but why had the increase of the horse\r\nbeen checked sooner than that of the cattle?  Capt. Sulivan has taken\r\nmuch pains for me in this inquiry.  The Gauchos employed here attribute\r\nit chiefly to the stallions constantly roaming from place to place, and\r\ncompelling the mares to accompany them, whether or not the young foals\r\nare able to follow.  One Gaucho told Capt. Sulivan that he had watched\r\na stallion for a whole hour, violently kicking and biting a mare till\r\nhe forced her to leave her foal to its fate.  Capt. Sulivan can so far\r\ncorroborate this curious account, that he has several times found young\r\nfoals dead, whereas he has never found a dead calf.  Moreover, the dead\r\nbodies of full-grown horses are more frequently found, as if more\r\nsubject to disease or accidents, than those of the cattle.  From the\r\nsoftness of the ground their hoofs often grow irregularly to a great\r\nlength, and this causes lameness.  The predominant colours are roan and\r\niron-grey.  All the horses bred here, both tame and wild, are rather\r\nsmall-sized, though generally in good condition; and they have lost so\r\nmuch strength, that they are unfit to be used in taking wild cattle\r\nwith the lazo: in consequence, it is necessary to go to the great\r\nexpense of importing fresh horses from the Plata.  At some future\r\nperiod the southern hemisphere probably will have its breed of Falkland\r\nponies, as the northern has its Shetland breed.\r\n\r\nThe cattle, instead of having degenerated like the horses seem, as\r\nbefore remarked, to have increased in size; and they are much more\r\nnumerous than the horses. Capt. Sulivan informs me that they vary much\r\nless in the general form of their bodies and in the shape of their\r\nhorns than English cattle.  In colour they differ much; and it is a\r\nremarkable circumstance, that in different parts of this one small\r\nisland, different colours predominate.  Round Mount Usborne, at a\r\nheight of from 1000 to 1500 feet above the sea, about half of some of\r\nthe herds are mouse or lead-coloured, a tint which is not common in\r\nother parts of the island. Near Port Pleasant dark brown prevails,\r\nwhereas south of Choiseul Sound (which almost divides the island into\r\ntwo parts), white beasts with black heads and feet are the most common:\r\nin all parts black, and some spotted animals may be observed.  Capt.\r\nSulivan remarks, that the difference in the prevailing colours was so\r\nobvious, that in looking for the herds near Port Pleasant, they\r\nappeared from a long distance like black spots, whilst south of\r\nChoiseul Sound they appeared like white spots on the hill-sides.  Capt.\r\nSulivan thinks that the herds do not mingle; and it is a singular fact,\r\nthat the mouse-coloured cattle, though living on the high land, calve\r\nabout a month earlier in the season than the other coloured beasts on\r\nthe lower land.  It is interesting thus to find the once domesticated\r\ncattle breaking into three colours, of which some one colour would in\r\nall probability ultimately prevail over the others, if the herds were\r\nleft undisturbed for the next several centuries.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit is another animal which has been introduced; and has\r\nsucceeded very well; so that they abound over large parts of the\r\nisland.  Yet, like the horses, they are confined within certain limits;\r\nfor they have not crossed the central chain of hills, nor would they\r\nhave extended even so far as its base, if, as the Gauchos informed me,\r\nsmall colonies has not been carried there.  I should not have supposed\r\nthat these animals, natives of northern Africa, could have existed in a\r\nclimate so humid as this, and which enjoys so little sunshine that even\r\nwheat ripens only occasionally.  It is asserted that in Sweden, which\r\nany one would have thought a more favourable climate, the rabbit cannot\r\nlive out of doors.  The first few pairs, moreover, had here to content\r\nagainst pre-existing enemies, in the fox and some large hawks.  The\r\nFrench naturalists have considered the black variety a distinct\r\nspecies, and called it Lepus Magellanicus. [5] They imagined that\r\nMagellan, when talking of an animal under the name of \"conejos\" in the\r\nStrait of Magellan, referred to this species; but he was alluding to a\r\nsmall cavy, which to this day is thus called by the Spaniards.  The\r\nGauchos laughed at the idea of the black kind being different from the\r\ngrey, and they said that at all events it had not extended its range\r\nany further than the grey kind; that the two were never found separate;\r\nand that they readily bred together, and produced piebald offspring. Of\r\nthe latter I now possess a specimen, and it is marked about the head\r\ndifferently from the French specific description.  This circumstance\r\nshows how cautious naturalists should be in making species; for even\r\nCuvier, on looking at the skull of one of these rabbits, thought it was\r\nprobably distinct!\r\n\r\nThe only quadruped native to the island [6]; is a large wolf-like fox\r\n(Canis antarcticus), which is common to both East and West Falkland.  I\r\nhave no doubt it is a peculiar species, and confined to this\r\narchipelago; because many sealers, Gauchos, and Indians, who have\r\nvisited these islands, all maintain that no such animal is found in any\r\npart of South America.\r\n\r\nMolina, from a similarity in habits, thought that this was the same\r\nwith his \"culpeu;\" [7] but I have seen both, and they are quite\r\ndistinct.  These wolves are well known from Byron's account of their\r\ntameness and curiosity, which the sailors, who ran into the water to\r\navoid them, mistook for fierceness.  To this day their manners remain\r\nthe same. They have been observed to enter a tent, and actually pull\r\nsome meat from beneath the head of a sleeping seaman.  The Gauchos also\r\nhave frequently in the evening killed them, by holding out a piece of\r\nmeat in one hand, and in the other a knife ready to stick them.  As far\r\nas I am aware, there is no other instance in any part of the world, of\r\nso small a mass of broken land, distant from a continent, possessing so\r\nlarge an aboriginal quadruped peculiar to itself.  Their numbers have\r\nrapidly decreased; they are already banished from that half of the\r\nisland which lies to the eastward of the neck of land between St.\r\nSalvador Bay and Berkeley Sound.  Within a very few years after these\r\nislands shall have become regularly settled, in all probability this\r\nfor will be classed with the dodo, as an animal which has perished from\r\nthe face of the earth.\r\n\r\nAt night (17th) we slept on the neck of land at the head of Choiseul\r\nSound, which forms the south-west peninsula. The valley was pretty well\r\nsheltered from the cold wind, but there was very little brushwood for\r\nfuel.  The Gauchos, however, soon found what, to my great surprise,\r\nmade nearly as hot a fire as coals; this was the skeleton of a bullock\r\nlately killed, from which the flesh had been picked by the\r\ncarrion-hawks.  They told me that in winter they often killed a beast,\r\ncleaned the flesh from the bones with their knives, and then with these\r\nsame bones roasted the meat for their suppers.\r\n\r\n18th.--It rained during nearly the whole day.  At night we managed,\r\nhowever, with our saddle-cloths to keep ourselves pretty well dry and\r\nwarm; but the ground on which we slept was on each occasion nearly in\r\nthe state of a bog, and there was not a dry spot to sit down on after\r\nour day's ride.  I have in another part stated how singular it is that\r\nthere should be absolutely no trees on these islands, although Tierra\r\ndel Fuego is covered by one large forest.  The largest bush in the\r\nisland (belonging to the family of Compositae) is scarcely so tall as\r\nour gorse.  The best fuel is afforded by a green little bush about the\r\nsize of common heath, which has the useful property of burning while\r\nfresh and green.  It was very surprising to see the Gauchos, in the\r\nmidst of rain and everything soaking wet, with nothing more than a\r\ntinder-box and a piece of rag, immediately make a fire.  They sought\r\nbeneath the tufts of grass and bushel for a few dry twigs, and these\r\nthey rubbed into fibres; then surrounding them with coarser twigs,\r\nsomething like a bird's nest, they put the rag with its spark of fire\r\nin the middle and covered it up.  The nest being then held up to the\r\nwind, by degrees it smoked more and more, and at last burst out in\r\nflames.  I do not think any other method would have had a chance of\r\nsucceeding with such damp materials.\r\n\r\n19th.--Each morning, from not having ridden for some time previously, I\r\nwas very stiff.  I was surprised to hear the Gauchos, who have from\r\ninfancy almost lived on horseback, say that, under similar\r\ncircumstances, they always suffer.  St. Jago told me, that having been\r\nconfined for three months by illness, he went out hunting wild cattle,\r\nand in consequence, for the next two days, his thighs were so stiff\r\nthat he was obliged to lie in bed.  This shows that the Gauchos,\r\nalthough they do not appear to do so, yet really must exert much\r\nmuscular effort in riding.  The hunting wild cattle, in a country so\r\ndifficult to pass as this is on account of the swampy ground, must be\r\nvery hard work.  The Gauchos say they often pass at full speed over\r\nground which would be impassable at a slower pace; in the same manner\r\nas a man is able to skate over thin ice.  When hunting, the party\r\nendeavours to get as close as possible to the herd without being\r\ndiscovered.  Each man carries four or five pair of the bolas; these he\r\nthrows one after the other at as many cattle, which, when once\r\nentangled, are left for some days till they become a little exhausted\r\nby hunger and struggling. They are then let free and driven towards a\r\nsmall herd of tame animals, which have been brought to the spot on\r\npurpose. From their previous treatment, being too much terrified to\r\nleave the herd, they are easily driven, if their strength last out, to\r\nthe settlement.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued so very bad that we determine to make a push, and\r\ntry to reach the vessel before night. From the quantity of rain which\r\nhad fallen, the surface of the whole country was swampy.  I suppose my\r\nhorse fell at least a dozen times, and sometimes the whole six horses\r\nwere floundering in the mud together.  All the little streams are\r\nbordered by soft peat, which makes it very difficult for the horses to\r\nleap them without falling.  To complete our discomforts we were obliged\r\nto cross the head of a creek of the sea, in which the water was as high\r\nas our horses' backs; and the little waves, owing to the violence of\r\nthe wind, broke over us, and made us very wet and cold.  Even the\r\niron-framed Gauchos professed themselves glad when they reached the\r\nsettlement, after our little excursion.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure of these islands is in most respects simple.\r\nThe lower country consists of clay-slate and sandstone, containing\r\nfossils, very closely related to, but not identical with, those found\r\nin the Silurian formations of Europe; the hills are formed of white\r\ngranular quartz rock.  The strata of the latter are frequently arched\r\nwith perfect symmetry, and the appearance of some of the masses is in\r\nconsequence most singular.  Pernety [8] has devoted several pages to\r\nthe description of a Hill of Ruins, the successive strata of which he\r\nhas justly compared to the seats of an amphitheatre.  The quartz rock\r\nmust have been quite pasty when it underwent such remarkable flexures\r\nwithout being shattered into fragments.  As the quartz insensibly\r\npasses into the sandstone, it seems probable that the former owes its\r\norigin to the sandstone having been heated to such a degree that it\r\nbecame viscid, and upon cooling crystallized.  While in the soft state\r\nit must have been pushed up through the overlying beds.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the island the bottoms of the valleys are covered in\r\nan extraordinary manner by myriads of great loose angular fragments of\r\nthe quartz rock, forming \"streams of stones.\" These have been mentioned\r\nwith surprise by every voyager since the time of Pernety.  The blocks\r\nare not water-worn, their angles being only a little blunted; they vary\r\nin size from one or two feet in diameter to ten, or even more than\r\ntwenty times as much.  They are not thrown together into irregular\r\npiles, but are spread out into level sheets or great streams.  It is\r\nnot possible to ascertain their thickness, but the water of small\r\nstreamlets can be heard trickling through the stones many feet below\r\nthe surface. The actual depth is probably great, because the crevices\r\nbetween the lower fragments must long ago have been filled up with\r\nsand.  The width of these sheets of stones varied from a few hundred\r\nfeet to a mile; but the peaty soil daily encroaches on the borders, and\r\neven forms islets wherever a few fragments happen to lie close\r\ntogether.  In a valley south of Berkeley Sound, which some of our party\r\ncalled the \"great valley of fragments,\" it was necessary to cross an\r\nuninterrupted band half a mile wide, by jumping from one pointed stone\r\nto another.  So large were the fragments, that being overtaken by a\r\nshower of rain, I readily found shelter beneath one of them.\r\n\r\nTheir little inclination is the most remarkable circumstance in these\r\n\"streams of stones.\" On the hill-sides I have seen them sloping at an\r\nangle of ten degrees with the horizon; but in some of the level,\r\nbroad-bottomed valleys, the inclination is only just sufficient to be\r\nclearly perceived. On so rugged a surface there was no means of\r\nmeasuring the angle, but to give a common illustration, I may say that\r\nthe slope would not have checked the speed of an English mail-coach. In\r\nsome places, a continuous stream of these fragments followed up the\r\ncourse of a valley, and even extended to the very crest of the hill. On\r\nthese crests huge masses, exceeding in dimensions any small building,\r\nseemed to stand arrested in their headlong course: there, also, the\r\ncurved strata of the archways lay piled on each other, like the ruins\r\nof some vast and ancient cathedral.  In endeavouring to describe these\r\nscenes of violence one is tempted to pass from one simile to another.\r\nWe may imagine that streams of white lava had flowed from many parts of\r\nthe mountains into the lower country, and that when solidified they had\r\nbeen rent by some enormous convulsion into myriads of fragments. The\r\nexpression \"streams of stones,\" which immediately occurred to every\r\none, conveys the same idea.  These scenes are on the spot rendered more\r\nstriking by the contrast of the low rounded forms of the neighbouring\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nI was interested by finding on the highest peak of one range (about 700\r\nfeet above the sea) a great arched fragment, lying on its convex side,\r\nor back downwards.  Must we believe that it was fairly pitched up in\r\nthe air, and thus turned?  Or, with more probability, that there\r\nexisted formerly a part of the same range more elevated than the point\r\non which this monument of a great convulsion of nature now lies.  As\r\nthe fragments in the valleys are neither rounded nor the crevices\r\nfilled up with sand, we must infer that the period of violence was\r\nsubsequent to the land having been raised above the waters of the sea.\r\nIn a transverse section within these valleys, the bottom is nearly\r\nlevel, or rises but very little towards either side.  Hence the\r\nfragments appear to have travelled from the head of the valley; but in\r\nreality it seems more probable that they have been hurled down from the\r\nnearest slopes; and that since, by a vibratory movement of overwhelming\r\nforce, [9] the fragments have been levelled into one continuous sheet.\r\nIf during the earthquake [10] which in 1835 overthrew Concepcion, in\r\nChile, it was thought wonderful that small bodies should have been\r\npitched a few inches from the ground, what must we say to a movement\r\nwhich has caused fragments many tons in weight, to move onwards like so\r\nmuch sand on a vibrating board, and find their level?  I have seen, in\r\nthe Cordillera of the Andes, the evident marks where stupendous\r\nmountains have been broken into pieces like so much thin crust, and the\r\nstrata thrown of their vertical edges; but never did any scene, like\r\nthese \"streams of stones,\" so forcibly convey to my mind the idea of a\r\nconvulsion, of which in historical records we might in vain seek for\r\nany counterpart: yet the progress of knowledge will probably some day\r\ngive a simple explanation of this phenomenon, as it already has of the\r\nso long-thought inexplicable transportal of the erratic boulders, which\r\nare strewed over the plains of Europe.\r\n\r\nI have little to remark on the zoology of these islands. have before\r\ndescribed the carrion-vulture of Polyborus. There are some other hawks,\r\nowls, and a few small land-birds. The water-fowl are particularly\r\nnumerous, and they must formerly, from the accounts of the old\r\nnavigators, have been much more so.  One day I observed a cormorant\r\nplaying with a fish which it had caught.  Eight times successively the\r\nbird let its prey go, then dived after it, and although in deep water,\r\nbrought it each time to the surface. In the Zoological Gardens I have\r\nseen the otter treat a fish in the same manner, much as a cat does a\r\nmouse: I do not know of any other instance where dame Nature appears so\r\nwilfully cruel.  Another day, having placed myself between a penguin\r\n(Aptenodytes demersa) and the water, I was much amused by watching its\r\nhabits.  It was a brave bird; and till reaching the sea, it regularly\r\nfought and drove me backwards. Nothing less than heavy blows would have\r\nstopped him; every inch he gained he firmly kept, standing close before\r\nme erect and determined.  When thus opposed he continually rolled his\r\nhead from side to side, in a very odd manner, as if the power of\r\ndistinct vision lay only in the anterior and basal part of each eye.\r\nThis bird is commonly called the jackass penguin, from its habit, while\r\non shore, of throwing its head backwards, and making a loud strange\r\nnoise, very like the braying of an ass; but while at sea, and\r\nundisturbed, its note is very deep and solemn, and is often heard in\r\nthe night-time. In diving, its little wings are used as fins; but on\r\nthe land, as front legs.  When crawling, it may be said on four legs,\r\nthrough the tussocks or on the side of a grassy cliff, it moves so very\r\nquickly that it might easily be mistaken for a quadruped.  When at sea\r\nand fishing, it comes to the surface for the purpose of breathing with\r\nsuch a spring, and dives again so instantaneously, that I defy any one\r\nat first sight to be sure that it was not a fish leaping for sport.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of geese frequent the Falklands.  The upland species (Anas\r\nMagellanica) is common, in pairs and in small flocks, throughout the\r\nisland.  They do not migrate, but build on the small outlying islets.\r\nThis is supposed to be from fear of the foxes: and it is perhaps from\r\nthe same cause that these birds, though very tame by day, are shy and\r\nwild in the dusk of the evening.  They live entirely on vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe rock-goose, so called from living exclusively on the sea-beach\r\n(Anas antarctica), is common both here and on the west coast of\r\nAmerica, as far north as Chile.  In the deep and retired channels of\r\nTierra del Fuego, the snow-white gander, invariably accompanied by his\r\ndarker consort, and standing close by each other on some distant rocky\r\npoint, is a common feature in the landscape.\r\n\r\nIn these islands a great loggerheaded duck or goose (Anas brachyptera),\r\nwhich sometimes weighs twenty-two pounds, is very abundant.  These\r\nbirds were in former days called, from their extraordinary manner of\r\npaddling and splashing upon the water, race-horses; but now they are\r\nnamed, much more appropriately, steamers.  Their wings are too small\r\nand weak to allow of flight, but by their aid, partly swimming and\r\npartly flapping the surface of the water, they move very quickly.  The\r\nmanner is something like that by which the common house-duck escapes\r\nwhen pursued by a dog; but I am nearly sure that the steamer moves its\r\nwings alternately, instead of both together, as in other birds.  These\r\nclumsy, loggerheaded ducks make such a noise and splashing, that the\r\neffect is exceedingly curious.\r\n\r\nThus we find in South America three birds which use their wings for\r\nother purposes besides flight; the penguins as fins, the steamer as\r\npaddles, and the ostrich as sails: and the Apteryz of New Zealand, as\r\nwell as its gigantic extinct prototype the Deinornis, possess only\r\nrudimentary representatives of wings.  The steamer is able to dive only\r\nto a very short distance.  It feeds entirely on shell-fish from the\r\nkelp and tidal rocks: hence the beak and head, for the purpose of\r\nbreaking them, are surprisingly heavy and strong: the head is so strong\r\nthat I have scarcely been able to fracture it with my geological\r\nhammer; and all our sportsmen soon discovered how tenacious these birds\r\nwere of life.  When in the evening pluming themselves in a flock, they\r\nmake the same odd mixture of sounds which bull-frogs do within the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, as well as in the Falkland Islands, made many\r\nobservations on the lower marine animals, [11] but they are of little\r\ngeneral interest.  I will mention only one class of facts, relating to\r\ncertain zoophytes in the more highly organized division of that class.\r\nSeveral genera (Flustra, Eschara, Cellaria, Crisia, and others) agree\r\nin having singular moveable organs (like those of Flustra avicularia,\r\nfound in the European seas) attached to their cells.  The organ, in the\r\ngreater number of cases, very closely resembles the head of a vulture;\r\nbut the lower mandible can be opened much wider than in a real bird's\r\nbeak.  The head itself possessed considerable powers of movement, by\r\nmeans of a short neck. In one zoophyte the head itself was fixed, but\r\nthe lower jaw free: in another it was replaced by a triangular hood,\r\nwith beautifully-fitted trap-door, which evidently answered to the\r\nlower mandible.  In the greater number of species, each cell was\r\nprovided with one head, but in others each cell had two.\r\n\r\nThe young cells at the end of the branches of these corallines contain\r\nquite immature polypi, yet the vulture-head attached to them, though\r\nsmall, are in every respect perfect When the polypus was removed by a\r\nneedle from any of the cells, these organs did not appear in the least\r\naffected.  When one of the vulture-like heads was cut off from the\r\ncell, the lower mandible retained its power of opening and closing.\r\nPerhaps the most singular part of their structure is, that when there\r\nwere more than two rows of cells on a branch, the central cells were\r\nfurnished with these appendages, of only one-fourth the size of the\r\noutside ones.  Their movements varied according to the species; but in\r\nsome I never saw the least motion; while others, with the lower\r\nmandible generally wide open, oscillated backwards and forwards at the\r\nrate of about five seconds each turn, others moved rapidly and by\r\nstarts.  When touched with a needle, the beak generally seized the\r\npoint so firmly, that the whole branch might be shaken.\r\n\r\nThese bodies have no relation whatever with the production of the eggs\r\nor gemmules, as they are formed before the young polypi appear in the\r\ncells at the end of the growing branches; as they move independently of\r\nthe polypi, and do not appear to be in any way connected with them; and\r\nas they differ in size on the outer and inner rows of cells, I have\r\nlittle doubt, that in their functions, they are related rather to the\r\nhorny axis of the branches than to the polypi in the cells.  The fleshy\r\nappendage at the lower extremity of the sea-pen (described at Bahia\r\nBlanca) also forms part of the zoophyte, as a whole, in the same manner\r\nas the roots of a tree form part of the whole tree, and not of the\r\nindividual leaf or flower-buds.\r\n\r\nIn another elegant little coralline (Crisia?), each cell was furnished\r\nwith a long-toothed bristle, which had the power of moving quickly.\r\nEach of these bristles and each of the vulture-like heads generally\r\nmoved quite independently of the others, but sometimes all on both\r\nsides of a branch, sometimes only those on one side, moved together\r\ncoinstantaneously, sometimes each moved in regular order one after\r\nanother.  In these actions we apparently behold as perfect a\r\ntransmission of will in the zoophyte, though composed of thousands of\r\ndistinct polypi, as in any single animal.  The case, indeed, is not\r\ndifferent from that of the sea-pens, which, when touched, drew\r\nthemselves into the sand on the coast of Bahia Blanca.  I will state\r\none other instance of uniform action, though of a very different\r\nnature, in a zoophyte closely allied to Clytia, and therefore very\r\nsimply organized. Having kept a large tuft of it in a basin of\r\nsalt-water, when it was dark I found that as often as I rubbed any part\r\nof a branch, the whole became strongly phosphorescent with a green\r\nlight: I do not think I ever saw any object more beautifully so.  But\r\nthe remarkable circumstance was, that the flashes of light always\r\nproceeded up the branches, from the base towards the extremities.\r\n\r\nThe examination of these compound animals was always very interesting\r\nto me.  What can be more remarkable that to see a plant-like body\r\nproducing an egg, capable of swimming about and of choosing a proper\r\nplace to adhere to, which then sprouts into branches, each crowded with\r\ninnumerable distinct animals, often of complicated organizations. The\r\nbranches, moreover, as we have just seen, sometimes possess organs\r\ncapable of movement and independent of the polypi.  Surprising as this\r\nunion of separate individuals in common stock must always appear, every\r\ntree displays the same fact, for buds must be considered as individual\r\nplants. It is, however, natural to consider a polypus, furnished with a\r\nmouth, intestines, and other organs, as a distinct individual, whereas\r\nthe individuality of a leaf-bud is not easily realised, so that the\r\nunion of separate individuals in a common body is more striking in a\r\ncoralline than in a tree.  Our conception of a compound animal, where\r\nin some respects the individuality of each is not completed, may be\r\naided, by reflecting on the production of two distinct creatures by\r\nbisecting a single one with a knife, or where Nature herself performs\r\nthe task of bisection.  We may consider the polypi in a zoophyte, or\r\nthe buds in a tree, as cases where the division of the individual has\r\nnot been completely effected.  Certainly in the case of trees, and\r\njudging from analogy in that of corallines, the individuals propagated\r\nby buds seem more intimately related to each other, than eggs or seeds\r\nare to their parents.  It seems now pretty well established that plants\r\npropagated by buds all partake of a common duration of life; and it is\r\nfamiliar to every one, what singular and numerous peculiarities are\r\ntransmitted with certainty, by buds, layers, and grafts, which by\r\nseminal propagation never or only casually reappear.\r\n\r\n[1] The desserts of Syria are characterized, according to Volney (tom.\r\ni. p. 351), by woody bushes, numerous rats, gazelles and hares.  In the\r\nlandscape of Patagonia, the guanaco replaces the gazelle, and the\r\nagouti the hare.\r\n\r\n[2] I noticed that several hours before any one of the condors died,\r\nall the lice, with which it was infested, crawled to the outside\r\nfeathers.  I was assured that this always happens.\r\n\r\n[3] London's Magazine of Nat. Hist., vol. vii.\r\n\r\n[4] From accounts published since our voyage, and more especially from\r\nseveral interesting letters from Capt. Sulivan, R. N., employed on the\r\nsurvey, it appears that we took an exaggerated view of the badness of\r\nthe climate on these islands.  But when I reflect on the almost\r\nuniversal covering of peat, and on the fact of wheat seldom ripening\r\nhere, I can hardly believe that the climate in summer is so fine and\r\ndry as it has lately been represented.\r\n\r\n[5] Lesson's Zoology of the Voyage of the Coquille, tom. i. p. 168. All\r\nthe early voyagers, and especially Bougainville, distinctly state that\r\nthe wolf-like fox was the only native animal on the island.  The\r\ndistinction of the rabbit as a species, is taken from peculiarities in\r\nthe fur, from the shape of the head, and from the shortness of the\r\nears.  I may here observe that the difference between the Irish and\r\nEnglish hare rests upon nearly similar characters, only more strongly\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\n[6] I have reason, however, to suspect that there is a field-mouse. The\r\ncommon European rat and mouse have roamed far from the habitations of\r\nthe settlers.  The common hog has also run wild on one islet; all are\r\nof a black colour: the boars are very fierce, and have great trunks.\r\n\r\n[7] The \"culpeu\" is the Canis Magellanicus brought home by Captain King\r\nfrom the Strait of Magellan.  It is common in Chile.\r\n\r\n[8] Pernety, Voyage aux Isles Malouines, p. 526.\r\n\r\n[9] \"Nous n'avons pas ete moins saisis d'etonnement a la vue de\r\nl'innombrable quantite de pierres de touts grandeurs, bouleversees les\r\nunes sur les autres, et cependent rangees, comme si elles avoient ete\r\namoncelees negligemment pour remplir des ravins.  On ne se lassoit pas\r\nd'admirer les effets prodigieux de la nature.\"--Pernety, p. 526.\r\n\r\n[10] An inhabitant of Mendoza, and hence well capable of judging,\r\nassured me that, during the several years he had resided on these\r\nislands, he had never felt the slightest shock of an earthquake.\r\n\r\n[11] I was surprised to find, on counting the eggs of a large white\r\nDoris (this sea-slug was three and a half inches long), how\r\nextraordinarily numerous they were.  From two to five eggs (each\r\nthree-thousandths of an inch in diameter) were contained in spherical\r\nlittle case.  These were arranged two deep in transverse rows forming a\r\nribbon.  The ribbon adhered by its edge to the rock in an oval spire.\r\nOne which I found, measured nearly twenty inches in length and half in\r\nbreadth.  By counting how many balls were contained in a tenth of an\r\ninch in the row, and how many rows in an equal length of the ribbon, on\r\nthe most moderate computation there were six hundred thousand eggs. Yet\r\nthis Doris was certainly not very common; although I was often\r\nsearching under the stones, I saw only seven individuals.  No fallacy\r\nis more common with naturalists, than that the numbers of an individual\r\nspecies depend on its powers of propagation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTIERRA DEL FUEGO\r\n\r\nTierra del Fuego, first arrival--Good Success Bay--An Account of the\r\nFuegians on board--Interview With the Savages--Scenery of the\r\nForests--Cape Horn--Wigwam Cove--Miserable Condition of the\r\nSavages--Famines--Cannibals--Matricide--Religious Feelings--Great\r\nGale--Beagle Channel--Ponsonby Sound--Build Wigwams and settle the\r\nFuegians--Bifurcation of the Beagle Channel--Glaciers--Return to the\r\nShip--Second Visit in the Ship to the Settlement--Equality of Condition\r\namongst the Natives.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17th, 1832.--Having now finished with Patagonia and the\r\nFalkland Islands, I will describe our first arrival in Tierra del\r\nFuego.  A little after noon we doubled Cape St.  Diego, and entered the\r\nfamous strait of Le Maire.  We kept close to the Fuegian shore, but the\r\noutline of the rugged, inhospitable Statenland was visible amidst the\r\nclouds.  In the afternoon we anchored in the Bay of Good Success. While\r\nentering we were saluted in a manner becoming the inhabitants of this\r\nsavage land.  A group of Fuegians partly concealed by the entangled\r\nforest, were perched on a wild point overhanging the sea; and as we\r\npassed by, they sprang up and waving their tattered cloaks sent forth a\r\nloud and sonorous shout.  The savages followed the ship, and just\r\nbefore dark we saw their fire, and again heard their wild cry. The\r\nharbour consists of a fine piece of water half surrounded by low\r\nrounded mountains of clay-slate, which are covered to the water's edge\r\nby one dense gloomy forest.  A single glance at the landscape was\r\nsufficient to show me how widely different it was from anything I had\r\never beheld.  At night it blew a gale of wind, and heavy squalls from\r\nthe mountains swept past us.  It would have been a bad time out at sea,\r\nand we, as well as others, may call this Good Success Bay.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the Captain sent a party to communicate with the\r\nFuegians.  When we came within hail, one of the four natives who were\r\npresent advanced to receive us, and began to shout most vehemently,\r\nwishing to direct us where to land.  When we were on shore the party\r\nlooked rather alarmed, but continued talking and making gestures with\r\ngreat rapidity.  It was without exception the most curious and\r\ninteresting spectacle I ever beheld: I could not have believed how wide\r\nwas the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than\r\nbetween a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a\r\ngreater power of improvement.  The chief spokesman was old, and\r\nappeared to be the head of the family; the three others were powerful\r\nyoung men, about six feet high.  The women and children had been sent\r\naway.  These Fuegians are a very different race from the stunted,\r\nmiserable wretches farther westward; and they seem closely allied to\r\nthe famous Patagonians of the Strait of Magellan.  Their only garment\r\nconsists of a mantle made of guanaco skin, with the wool outside: this\r\nthey wear just thrown over their shoulders, leaving their persons as\r\noften exposed as covered.  Their skin is of a dirty coppery-red colour.\r\n\r\nThe old man had a fillet of white feathers tied round his head, which\r\npartly confined his black, coarse, and entangled hair.  His face was\r\ncrossed by two broad transverse bars; one, painted bright red, reached\r\nfrom ear to ear and included the upper lip; the other, white like\r\nchalk, extended above and parallel to the first, so that even his\r\neyelids were thus coloured.  The other two men were ornamented by\r\nstreaks of black powder, made of charcoal.  The party altogether\r\nclosely resembled the devils which come on the stage in plays like Der\r\nFreischutz.\r\n\r\nTheir very attitudes were abject, and the expression of their\r\ncountenances distrustful, surprised, and startled.  After we had\r\npresented them with some scarlet cloth, which they immediately tied\r\nround their necks, they became good friends. This was shown by the old\r\nman patting our breasts, and making a chuckling kind of noise, as\r\npeople do when feeding chickens.  I walked with the old man, and this\r\ndemonstration of friendship was repeated several times; it was\r\nconcluded by three hard slaps, which were given me on the breast and\r\nback at the same time.  He then bared his bosom for me to return the\r\ncompliment, which being done, he seemed highly pleased.  The language\r\nof these people, according to our notions, scarcely deserves to be\r\ncalled articulate.  Captain Cook has compared it to a man clearing his\r\nthroat, but certainly no European ever cleared his throat with so many\r\nhoarse, guttural, and clicking sounds.\r\n\r\nThey are excellent mimics: as often as we coughed or yawned, or made\r\nany odd motion, they immediately imitated us.  Some of our party began\r\nto squint and look awry; but one of the young Fuegians (whose whole\r\nface was painted black, excepting a white band across his eyes)\r\nsucceeded in making far more hideous grimaces.  They could repeat with\r\nperfect correctness each word in any sentence we addressed them, and\r\nthey remembered such words for some time.  Yet we Europeans all know\r\nhow difficult it is to distinguish apart the sounds in a foreign\r\nlanguage.  Which of us, for instance, could follow an American Indian\r\nthrough a sentence of more than three words?  All savages appear to\r\npossess, to an uncommon degree, this power of mimicry.  I was told,\r\nalmost in the same words, of the same ludicrous habit among the\r\nCaffres; the Australians, likewise, have long been notorious for being\r\nable to imitate and describe the gait of any man, so that he may be\r\nrecognized.  How can this faculty be explained? is it a consequence of\r\nthe more practised habits of perception and keener senses, common to\r\nall men in a savage state, as compared with those long civilized?\r\n\r\nWhen a song was struck up by our party, I thought the Fuegians would\r\nhave fallen down with astonishment.  With equal surprise they viewed\r\nour dancing; but one of the young men, when asked, had no objection to\r\na little waltzing. Little accustomed to Europeans as they appeared to\r\nbe, yet they knew and dreaded our fire-arms; nothing would tempt them\r\nto take a gun in their hands.  They begged for knives, calling them by\r\nthe Spanish word \"cuchilla.\" They explained also what they wanted, by\r\nacting as if they had a piece of blubber in their mouth, and then\r\npretending to cut instead of tear it.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet noticed the Fuegians whom we had on board.  During\r\nthe former voyage of the Adventure and Beagle in 1826 to 1830, Captain\r\nFitz Roy seized on a party of natives, as hostages for the loss of a\r\nboat, which had been stolen, to the great jeopardy of a party employed\r\non the survey; and some of these natives, as well as a child whom he\r\nbought for a pearl-button, he took with him to England, determining to\r\neducate them and instruct them in religion at his own expense.  To\r\nsettle these natives in their own country, was one chief inducement to\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy to undertake our present voyage; and before the\r\nAdmiralty had resolved to send out this expedition, Captain Fitz Roy\r\nhad generously chartered a vessel, and would himself have taken them\r\nback.  The natives were accompanied by a missionary, R. Matthews; of\r\nwhom and of the natives, Captain Fitz Roy has published a full and\r\nexcellent account.  Two men, one of whom died in England of the\r\nsmall-pox, a boy and a little girl, were originally taken; and we had\r\nnow on board, York Minster, Jemmy Button (whose name expresses his\r\npurchase-money), and Fuegia Basket.  York Minster was a full-grown,\r\nshort, thick, powerful man: his disposition was reserved, taciturn,\r\nmorose, and when excited violently passionate; his affections were very\r\nstrong towards a few friends on board; his intellect good.  Jemmy\r\nButton was a universal favourite, but likewise passionate; the\r\nexpression of his face at once showed his nice disposition.  He was\r\nmerry and often laughed, and was remarkably sympathetic with any one in\r\npain: when the water was rough, I was often a little sea-sick, and he\r\nused to come to me and say in a plaintive voice, \"Poor, poor fellow!\"\r\nbut the notion, after his aquatic life, of a man being sea-sick, was\r\ntoo ludicrous, and he was generally obliged to turn on one side to hide\r\na smile or laugh, and then he would repeat his \"Poor, poor fellow!\" He\r\nwas of a patriotic disposition; and he liked to praise his own tribe\r\nand country, in which he truly said there were \"plenty of trees,\" and\r\nhe abused all the other tribes: he stoutly declared that there was no\r\nDevil in his land. Jemmy was short, thick, and fat, but vain of his\r\npersonal appearance; he used always to wear gloves, his hair was neatly\r\ncut, and he was distressed if his well-polished shoes were dirtied.  He\r\nwas fond of admiring himself in a looking glass; and a merry-faced\r\nlittle Indian boy from the Rio Negro, whom we had for some months on\r\nboard, soon perceived this, and used to mock him: Jemmy, who was always\r\nrather jealous of the attention paid to this little boy, did not at all\r\nlike this, and used to say, with rather a contemptuous twist of his\r\nhead, \"Too much skylark.\" It seems yet wonderful to me, when I think\r\nover all his many good qualities that he should have been of the same\r\nrace, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable,\r\ndegraded savages whom we first met here.  Lastly, Fuegia Basket was a\r\nnice, modest, reserved young girl, with a rather pleasing but sometimes\r\nsullen expression, and very quick in learning anything, especially\r\nlanguages.  This she showed in picking up some Portuguese and Spanish,\r\nwhen left on shore for only a short time at Rio de Janeiro and Monte\r\nVideo, and in her knowledge of English.  York Minster was very jealous\r\nof any attention paid to her; for it was clear he determined to marry\r\nher as soon as they were settled on shore.\r\n\r\nAlthough all three could both speak and understand a good deal of\r\nEnglish, it was singularly difficult to obtain much information from\r\nthem, concerning the habits of their countrymen; this was partly owing\r\nto their apparent difficulty in understanding the simplest alternative.\r\nEvery one accustomed to very young children, knows how seldom one can\r\nget an answer even to so simple a question as whether a thing is black\r\nor white; the idea of black or white seems alternately to fill their\r\nminds.  So it was with these Fuegians, and hence it was generally\r\nimpossible to find out, by cross questioning, whether one had rightly\r\nunderstood anything which they had asserted.  Their sight was\r\nremarkably acute; it is well known that sailors, from long practice,\r\ncan make out a distant object much better than a landsman; but both\r\nYork and Jemmy were much superior to any sailor on board: several times\r\nthey have declared what some distant object has been, and though\r\ndoubted by every one, they have proved right, when it has been examined\r\nthrough a telescope.  They were quite conscious of this power; and\r\nJemmy, when he had any little quarrel with the officer on watch, would\r\nsay, \"Me see ship, me no tell.\"\r\n\r\nIt was interesting to watch the conduct of the savages, when we landed,\r\ntowards Jemmy Button: they immediately perceived the difference between\r\nhim and ourselves, and held much conversation one with another on the\r\nsubject.  The old man addressed a long harangue to Jemmy, which it\r\nseems was to invite him to stay with them. But Jemmy understood very\r\nlittle of their language, and was, moreover, thoroughly ashamed of his\r\ncountrymen.  When York Minster afterwards came on shore, they noticed\r\nhim in the same way, and told him he ought to shave; yet he had not\r\ntwenty dwarf hairs on his face, whilst we all wore our untrimmed\r\nbeards.  They examined the colour of his skin, and compared it with\r\nours.  One of our arms being bared, they expressed the liveliest\r\nsurprise and admiration at its whiteness, just in the same way in which\r\nI have seen the ourangoutang do at the Zoological Gardens.  We thought\r\nthat they mistook two or three of the officers, who were rather shorter\r\nand fairer, though adorned with large beards, for the ladies of our\r\nparty.  The tallest amongst the Fuegians was evidently much pleased at\r\nhis height being noticed.  When placed back to back with the tallest of\r\nthe boat's crew, he tried his best to edge on higher ground, and to\r\nstand on tiptoe.  He opened his mouth to show his teeth, and turned his\r\nface for a side view; and all this was done with such alacrity, that I\r\ndare say he thought himself the handsomest man in Tierra del Fuego.\r\nAfter our first feeling of grave astonishment was over, nothing could\r\nbe more ludicrous than the odd mixture of surprise and imitation which\r\nthese savages every moment exhibited.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day I attempted to penetrate some way into the country. Tierra\r\ndel Fuego may be described as a mountainous land, partly submerged in\r\nthe sea, so that deep inlets and bays occupy the place where valleys\r\nshould exist.  The mountain sides, except on the exposed western coast,\r\nare covered from the water's edge upwards by one great forest. The\r\ntrees reach to an elevation of between 1000 and 1500 feet, and are\r\nsucceeded by a band of peat, with minute alpine plants; and this again\r\nis succeeded by the line of perpetual snow, which, according to Captain\r\nKing, in the Strait of Magellan descends to between 3000 and 4000 feet.\r\nTo find an acre of level land in any part of the country is most rare.\r\nI recollect only one little flat piece near Port Famine, and another of\r\nrather larger extent near Goeree Road.  In both places, and everywhere\r\nelse, the surface is covered by a thick bed of swampy peat. Even within\r\nthe forest, the ground is concealed by a mass of slowly putrefying\r\nvegetable matter, which, from being soaked with water, yields to the\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nFinding it nearly hopeless to push my way through the wood, I followed\r\nthe course of a mountain torrent.  At first, from the waterfalls and\r\nnumber of dead trees, I could hardly crawl along; but the bed of the\r\nstream soon became a little more open, from the floods having swept the\r\nsides.  I continued slowly to advance for an hour along the broken and\r\nrocky banks, and was amply repaid by the grandeur of the scene.  The\r\ngloomy depth of the ravine well accorded with the universal signs of\r\nviolence.  On every side were lying irregular masses of rock and\r\ntorn-up trees; other trees, though still erect, were decayed to the\r\nheart and ready to fall.  The entangled mass of the thriving and the\r\nfallen reminded me of the forests within the tropics--yet there was a\r\ndifference: for in these still solitudes, Death, instead of Life,\r\nseemed the predominant spirit.  I followed the water-course till I came\r\nto a spot where a great slip had cleared a straight space down the\r\nmountain side.  By this road I ascended to a considerable elevation,\r\nand obtained a good view of the surrounding woods.  The trees all\r\nbelong to one kind, the Fagus betuloides; for the number of the other\r\nspecies of Fagus and of the Winter's Bark, is quite inconsiderable.\r\nThis beech keeps its leaves throughout the year; but its foliage is of\r\na peculiar brownish-green colour, with a tinge of yellow.  As the whole\r\nlandscape is thus coloured, it has a sombre, dull appearance; nor is it\r\noften enlivened by the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nDecember 20th.--One side of the harbour is formed by a hill about 1500\r\nfeet high, which Captain Fitz Roy has called after Sir J. Banks, in\r\ncommemoration of his disastrous excursion, which proved fatal to two\r\nmen of his party, and nearly so to Dr. Solander.  The snow-storm, which\r\nwas the cause of their misfortune, happened in the middle of January,\r\ncorresponding to our July, and in the latitude of Durham! I was anxious\r\nto reach the summit of this mountain to collect alpine plants; for\r\nflowers of any kind in the lower parts are few in number.  We followed\r\nthe same water-course as on the previous day, till it dwindled away,\r\nand we were then compelled to crawl blindly among the trees. These,\r\nfrom the effects of the elevation and of the impetuous winds, were low,\r\nthick and crooked.  At length we reached that which from a distance\r\nappeared like a carpet of fine green turf, but which, to our vexation,\r\nturned out to be a compact mass of little beech-trees about four or\r\nfive feet high.  They were as thick together as box in the border of a\r\ngarden, and we were obliged to struggle over the flat but treacherous\r\nsurface.  After a little more trouble we gained the peat, and then the\r\nbare slate rock.\r\n\r\nA ridge connected this hill with another, distant some miles, and more\r\nlofty, so that patches of snow were lying on it.  As the day was not\r\nfar advanced, I determined to walk there and collect plants along the\r\nroad.  It would have been very hard work, had it not been for a\r\nwell-beaten and straight path made by the guanacos; for these animals,\r\nlike sheep, always follow the same line.  When we reached the hill we\r\nfound it the highest in the immediate neighbourhood, and the waters\r\nflowed to the sea in opposite directions.  We obtained a wide view over\r\nthe surrounding country: to the north a swampy moorland extended, but\r\nto the south we had a scene of savage magnificence, well becoming\r\nTierra del Fuego.  There was a degree of mysterious grandeur in\r\nmountain behind mountain, with the deep intervening valleys, all\r\ncovered by one thick, dusky mass of forest.  The atmosphere, likewise,\r\nin this climate, where gale succeeds gale, with rain, hail, and sleet,\r\nseems blacker than anywhere else.  In the Strait of Magellan looking\r\ndue southward from Port Famine, the distant channels between the\r\nmountains appeared from their gloominess to lead beyond the confines of\r\nthis world.\r\n\r\nDecember 21st.--The Beagle got under way: and on the succeeding day,\r\nfavoured to an uncommon degree by a fine easterly breeze, we closed in\r\nwith the Barnevelts, and running past Cape Deceit with its stony peaks,\r\nabout three o'clock doubled the weather-beaten Cape Horn.  The evening\r\nwas calm and bright, and we enjoyed a fine view of the surrounding\r\nisles.  Cape Horn, however, demanded his tribute, and before night sent\r\nus a gale of wind directly in our teeth. We stood out to sea, and on\r\nthe second day again made the land, when we saw on our weather-bow this\r\nnotorious promontory in its proper form--veiled in a mist, and its dim\r\noutline surrounded by a storm of wind and water.  Great black clouds\r\nwere rolling across the heavens, and squalls of rain, with hail, swept\r\nby us with such extreme violence, that the Captain determined to run\r\ninto Wigwam Cove. This is a snug little harbour, not far from Cape\r\nHorn; and here, at Christmas-eve, we anchored in smooth water.  The\r\nonly thing which reminded us of the gale outside, was every now and\r\nthen a puff from the mountains, which made the ship surge at her\r\nanchors.\r\n\r\nDecember 25th.--Close by the Cove, a pointed hill, called Kater's Peak,\r\nrises to the height of 1700 feet.  The surrounding islands all consist\r\nof conical masses of greenstone, associated sometimes with less regular\r\nhills of baked and altered clay-slate.  This part of Tierra del Fuego\r\nmay be considered as the extremity of the submerged chain of mountains\r\nalready alluded to.  The cove takes its name of \"Wigwam\" from some of\r\nthe Fuegian habitations; but every bay in the neighbourhood might be so\r\ncalled with equal propriety.  The inhabitants, living chiefly upon\r\nshell-fish, are obliged constantly to change their place of residence;\r\nbut they return at intervals to the same spots, as is evident from the\r\npiles of old shells, which must often amount to many tons in freight.\r\nThese heaps can be distinguished at a long distance by the bright green\r\ncolour of certain plants, which invariably grow on them.  Among these\r\nmay be enumerated the wild celery and scurvy grass, two very\r\nserviceable plants, the use of which has not been discovered by the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nThe Fuegian wigwam resembles, in size and dimensions, a haycock.  It\r\nmerely consists of a few broken branches stuck in the ground, and very\r\nimperfectly thatched on one side with a few tufts of grass and rushes.\r\nThe whole cannot be the work of an hour, and it is only used for a few\r\ndays. At Goeree Roads I saw a place where one of these naked men had\r\nslept, which absolutely offered no more cover than the form of a hare.\r\nThe man was evidently living by himself, and York Minster said he was\r\n\"very bad man,\" and that probably he had stolen something.  On the west\r\ncoast, however, the wigwams are rather better, for they are covered\r\nwith seal-skins.  We were detained here several days by the bad\r\nweather.  The climate is certainly wretched: the summer solstice was\r\nnow passed, yet every day snow fell on the hills, and in the valleys\r\nthere was rain, accompanied by sleet.  The thermometer generally stood\r\nabout 45 degs., but in the night fell to 38 or 40 degs.  From the damp\r\nand boisterous state of the atmosphere, not cheered by a gleam of\r\nsunshine, one fancied the climate even worse than it really was.\r\n\r\nWhile going one day on shore near Wollaston Island, we pulled alongside\r\na canoe with six Fuegians.  These were the most abject and miserable\r\ncreatures I anywhere beheld.  On the east coast the natives, as we have\r\nseen, have guanaco cloaks, and on the west they possess seal-skins.\r\nAmongst these central tribes the men generally have an otter-skin, or\r\nsome small scrap about as large as a pocket-handkerchief, which is\r\nbarely sufficient to cover their backs as low down as their loins.  It\r\nis laced across the breast by strings, and according as the wind blows,\r\nit is shifted from side to side. But these Fuegians in the canoe were\r\nquite naked, and even one full-grown woman was absolutely so.  It was\r\nraining heavily, and the fresh water, together with the spray, trickled\r\ndown her body.  In another harbour not far distant, a woman, who was\r\nsuckling a recently-born child, came one day alongside the vessel, and\r\nremained there out of mere curiosity, whilst the sleet fell and thawed\r\non her naked bosom, and on the skin of her naked baby!  These poor\r\nwretches were stunted in their growth, their hideous faces bedaubed\r\nwith white paint, their skins filthy and greasy, their hair entangled,\r\ntheir voices discordant, and their gestures violent.  Viewing such men,\r\none can hardly make one's self believe that they are fellow-creatures,\r\nand inhabitants of the same world.  It is a common subject of\r\nconjecture what pleasure in life some of the lower animals can enjoy:\r\nhow much more reasonably the same question may be asked with respect to\r\nthese barbarians!  At night, five or six human beings, naked and\r\nscarcely protected from the wind and rain of this tempestuous climate,\r\nsleep on the wet ground coiled up like animals.  Whenever it is low\r\nwater, winter or summer, night or day, they must rise to pick\r\nshell-fish from the rocks; and the women either dive to collect\r\nsea-eggs, or sit patiently in their canoes, and with a baited hair-line\r\nwithout any hook, jerk out little fish.  If a seal is killed, or the\r\nfloating carcass of a putrid whale is discovered, it is a feast; and\r\nsuch miserable food is assisted by a few tasteless berries and fungi.\r\n\r\nThey often suffer from famine: I heard Mr. Low, a sealing-master\r\nintimately acquainted with the natives of this country, give a curious\r\naccount of the state of a party of one hundred and fifty natives on the\r\nwest coast, who were very thin and in great distress.  A succession of\r\ngales prevented the women from getting shell-fish on the rocks, and\r\nthey could not go out in their canoes to catch seal.  A small party of\r\nthese men one morning set out, and the other Indians explained to him,\r\nthat they were going a four days' journey for food: on their return,\r\nLow went to meet them, and he found them excessively tired, each man\r\ncarrying a great square piece of putrid whale's-blubber with a hole in\r\nthe middle, through which they put their heads, like the Gauchos do\r\nthrough their ponchos or cloaks.  As soon as the blubber was brought\r\ninto a wigwam, an old man cut off thin slices, and muttering over them,\r\nbroiled them for a minute, and distributed them to the famished party,\r\nwho during this time preserved a profound silence.  Mr. Low believes\r\nthat whenever a whale is cast on shore, the natives bury large pieces\r\nof it in the sand, as a resource in time of famine; and a native boy,\r\nwhom he had on board, once found a stock thus buried.  The different\r\ntribes when at war are cannibals.  From the concurrent, but quite\r\nindependent evidence of the boy taken by Mr. Low, and of Jemmy Button,\r\nit is certainly true, that when pressed in winter by hunger, they kill\r\nand devour their old women before they kill their dogs: the boy, being\r\nasked by Mr. Low why they did this, answered, \"Doggies catch otters,\r\nold women no.\" This boy described the manner in which they are killed\r\nby being held over smoke and thus choked; he imitated their screams as\r\na joke, and described the parts of their bodies which are considered\r\nbest to eat.  Horrid as such a death by the hands of their friends and\r\nrelatives must be, the fears of the old women, when hunger begins to\r\npress, are more painful to think of; we are told that they then often\r\nrun away into the mountains, but that they are pursued by the men and\r\nbrought back to the slaughter-house at their own firesides!\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy could never ascertain that the Fuegians have any\r\ndistinct belief in a future life.  They sometimes bury their dead in\r\ncaves, and sometimes in the mountain forests; we do not know what\r\nceremonies they perform. Jemmy Button would not eat land-birds, because\r\n\"eat dead men\": they are unwilling even to mention their dead friends.\r\nWe have no reason to believe that they perform any sort of religious\r\nworship; though perhaps the muttering of the old man before he\r\ndistributed the putrid blubber to his famished party, may be of this\r\nnature.  Each family or tribe has a wizard or conjuring doctor, whose\r\noffice we could never clearly ascertain.  Jemmy believed in dreams,\r\nthough not, as I have said, in the devil: I do not think that our\r\nFuegians were much more superstitious than some of the sailors; for an\r\nold quartermaster firmly believed that the successive heavy gales,\r\nwhich we encountered off Cape Horn, were caused by our having the\r\nFuegians on board.  The nearest approach to a religious feeling which I\r\nheard of, was shown by York Minster, who, when Mr. Bynoe shot some very\r\nyoung ducklings as specimens, declared in the most solemn manner, \"Oh,\r\nMr. Bynoe, much rain, snow, blow much.\" This was evidently a\r\nretributive punishment for wasting human food.  In a wild and excited\r\nmanner he also related, that his brother, one day whilst returning to\r\npick up some dead birds which he had left on the coast, observed some\r\nfeathers blown by the wind.  His brother said (York imitating his\r\nmanner), \"What that?\" and crawling onwards, he peeped over the cliff,\r\nand saw \"wild man\" picking his birds; he crawled a little nearer, and\r\nthen hurled down a great stone and killed him.  York declared for a\r\nlong time afterwards storms raged, and much rain and snow fell. As far\r\nas we could make out, he seemed to consider the elements themselves as\r\nthe avenging agents: it is evident in this case, how naturally, in a\r\nrace a little more advanced in culture, the elements would become\r\npersonified.  What the \"bad wild men\" were, has always appeared to me\r\nmost mysterious: from what York said, when we found the place like the\r\nform of a hare, where a single man had slept the night before, I should\r\nhave thought that they were thieves who had been driven from their\r\ntribes; but other obscure speeches made me doubt this; I have sometimes\r\nimagined that the most probable explanation was that they were insane.\r\n\r\nThe different tribes have no government or chief; yet each is\r\nsurrounded by other hostile tribes, speaking different dialects, and\r\nseparated from each other only by a deserted border or neutral\r\nterritory: the cause of their warfare appears to be the means of\r\nsubsistence.  Their country is a broken mass of wild rocks, lofty\r\nhills, and useless forests: and these are viewed through mists and\r\nendless storms.  The habitable land is reduced to the stones on the\r\nbeach; in search of food they are compelled unceasingly to wander from\r\nspot to spot, and so steep is the coast, that they can only move about\r\nin their wretched canoes.  They cannot know the feeling of having a\r\nhome, and still less that of domestic affection; for the husband is to\r\nthe wife a brutal master to a laborious slave.  Was a more horrid deed\r\never perpetrated, than that witnessed on the west coast by Byron, who\r\nsaw a wretched mother pick up her bleeding dying infant-boy, whom her\r\nhusband had mercilessly dashed on the stones for dropping a basket of\r\nsea-eggs!  How little can the higher powers of the mind be brought into\r\nplay: what is there for imagination to picture, for reason to compare,\r\nor judgment to decide upon? to knock a limpet from the rock does not\r\nrequire even cunning, that lowest power of the mind.  Their skill in\r\nsome respects may be compared to the instinct of animals; for it is not\r\nimproved by experience: the canoe, their most ingenious work, poor as\r\nit is, has remained the same, as we know from Drake, for the last two\r\nhundred and fifty years.\r\n\r\nWhilst beholding these savages, one asks, whence have they come?  What\r\ncould have tempted, or what change compelled a tribe of men, to leave\r\nthe fine regions of the north, to travel down the Cordillera or\r\nbackbone of America, to invent and build canoes, which are not used by\r\nthe tribes of Chile, Peru, and Brazil, and then to enter on one of the\r\nmost inhospitable countries within the limits of the globe? Although\r\nsuch reflections must at first seize on the mind, yet we may feel sure\r\nthat they are partly erroneous.  There is no reason to believe that the\r\nFuegians decrease in number; therefore we must suppose that they enjoy\r\na sufficient share of happiness, of whatever kind it may be, to render\r\nlife worth having.  Nature by making habit omnipotent, and its effects\r\nhereditary, has fitted the Fuegian to the climate and the productions\r\nof his miserable country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having been detained six days in Wigwam Cove by very bad weather,\r\nwe put to sea on the 30th of December. Captain Fitz Roy wished to get\r\nwestward to land York and Fuegia in their own country.  When at sea we\r\nhad a constant succession of gales, and the current was against us: we\r\ndrifted to 57 degs. 23' south.  On the 11th of January, 1833, by\r\ncarrying a press of sail, we fetched within a few miles of the great\r\nrugged mountain of York Minster (so called by Captain Cook, and the\r\norigin of the name of the elder Fuegian), when a violent squall\r\ncompelled us to shorten sail and stand out to sea.  The surf was\r\nbreaking fearfully on the coast, and the spray was carried over a cliff\r\nestimated to 200 feet in height.  On the 12th the gale was very heavy,\r\nand we did not know exactly where we were: it was a most unpleasant\r\nsound to hear constantly repeated, \"keep a good look-out to leeward.\"\r\nOn the 13th the storm raged with its full fury: our horizon was\r\nnarrowly limited by the sheets of spray borne by the wind.  The sea\r\nlooked ominous, like a dreary waving plain with patches of drifted\r\nsnow: whilst the ship laboured heavily, the albatross glided with its\r\nexpanded wings right up the wind.  At noon a great sea broke over us,\r\nand filled one of the whale boats, which was obliged to be instantly\r\ncut away.  The poor Beagle trembled at the shock, and for a few minutes\r\nwould not obey her helm; but soon, like a good ship that she was, she\r\nrighted and came up to the wind again.  Had another sea followed the\r\nfirst, our fate would have been decided soon, and for ever.  We had now\r\nbeen twenty-four days trying in vain to get westward; the men were worn\r\nout with fatigue, and they had not had for many nights or days a dry\r\nthing to put on.  Captain Fitz Roy gave up the attempt to get westward\r\nby the outside coast.  In the evening we ran in behind False Cape Horn,\r\nand dropped our anchor in forty-seven fathoms, fire flashing from the\r\nwindlass as the chain rushed round it.  How delightful was that still\r\nnight, after having been so long involved in the din of the warring\r\nelements!\r\n\r\nJanuary 15th, 1833.--The Beagle anchored in Goeree Roads.  Captain Fitz\r\nRoy having resolved to settle the Fuegians, according to their wishes,\r\nin Ponsonby Sound, four boats were equipped to carry them there through\r\nthe Beagle Channel.  This channel, which was discovered by Captain Fitz\r\nRoy during the last voyage, is a most remarkable feature in the\r\ngeography of this, or indeed of any other country: it may be compared\r\nto the valley of Lochness in Scotland, with its chain of lakes and\r\nfriths.  It is about one hundred and twenty miles long, with an average\r\nbreadth, not subject to any very great variation, of about two miles;\r\nand is throughout the greater part so perfectly straight, that the\r\nview, bounded on each side by a line of mountains, gradually becomes\r\nindistinct in the long distance.  It crosses the southern part of\r\nTierra del Fuego in an east and west line, and in the middle is joined\r\nat right angles on the south side by an irregular channel, which has\r\nbeen called Ponsonby Sound. This is the residence of Jemmy Button's\r\ntribe and family.\r\n\r\n19th.--Three whale-boats and the yawl, with a party of twenty-eight,\r\nstarted under the command of Captain Fitz Roy.  In the afternoon we\r\nentered the eastern mouth of the channel, and shortly afterwards found\r\na snug little cove concealed by some surrounding islets.  Here we\r\npitched our tents and lighted our fires.  Nothing could look more\r\ncomfortable than this scene.  The glassy water of the little harbour,\r\nwith the branches of the trees hanging over the rocky beach, the boats\r\nat anchor, the tents supported by the crossed oars, and the smoke\r\ncurling up the wooded valley, formed a picture of quiet retirement. The\r\nnext day (20th) we smoothly glided onwards in our little fleet, and\r\ncame to a more inhabited district.  Few if any of these natives could\r\never have seen a white man; certainly nothing could exceed their\r\nastonishment at the apparition of the four boats.  Fires were lighted\r\non every point (hence the name of Tierra del Fuego, or the land of\r\nfire), both to attract our attention and to spread far and wide the\r\nnews.  Some of the men ran for miles along the shore.  I shall never\r\nforget how wild and savage one group appeared: suddenly four or five\r\nmen came to the edge of an overhanging cliff; they were absolutely\r\nnaked, and their long hair streamed about their faces; they held rugged\r\nstaffs in their hands, and, springing from the ground, they waved their\r\narms round their heads, and sent forth the most hideous yells.\r\n\r\nAt dinner-time we landed among a party of Fuegians. At first they were\r\nnot inclined to be friendly; for until the Captain pulled in ahead of\r\nthe other boats, they kept their slings in their hands.  We soon,\r\nhowever, delighted them by trifling presents, such as tying red tape\r\nround their heads. They liked our biscuit: but one of the savages\r\ntouched with his finger some of the meat preserved in tin cases which I\r\nwas eating, and feeling it soft and cold, showed as much disgust at it,\r\nas I should have done at putrid blubber.  Jemmy was thoroughly ashamed\r\nof his countrymen, and declared his own tribe were quite different, in\r\nwhich he was wofully mistaken.  It was as easy to please as it was\r\ndifficult to satisfy these savages.  Young and old, men and children,\r\nnever ceased repeating the word \"yammerschooner,\" which means \"give\r\nme.\" After pointing to almost every object, one after the other, even\r\nto the buttons on our coats, and saying their favourite word in as many\r\nintonations as possible, they would then use it in a neuter sense, and\r\nvacantly repeat \"yammerschooner.\" After yammerschoonering for any\r\narticle very eagerly, they would by a simple artifice point to their\r\nyoung women or little children, as much as to say, \"If you will not\r\ngive it me, surely you will to such as these.\"\r\n\r\nAt night we endeavoured in vain to find an uninhabited cove; and at\r\nlast were obliged to bivouac not far from a party of natives.  They\r\nwere very inoffensive as long as they were few in numbers, but in the\r\nmorning (21st) being joined by others they showed symptoms of\r\nhostility, and we thought that we should have come to a skirmish.  An\r\nEuropean labours under great disadvantages when treating with savages\r\nlike these, who have not the least idea of the power of fire-arms.  In\r\nthe very act of levelling his musket he appears to the savage far\r\ninferior to a man armed with a bow and arrow, a spear, or even a sling.\r\nNor is it easy to teach them our superiority except by striking a fatal\r\nblow.  Like wild beasts, they do not appear to compare numbers; for\r\neach individual, if attacked, instead of retiring, will endeavour to\r\ndash your brains out with a stone, as certainly as a tiger under\r\nsimilar circumstances would tear you.  Captain Fitz Roy on one occasion\r\nbeing very anxious, from good reasons, to frighten away a small party,\r\nfirst flourished a cutlass near them, at which they only laughed; he\r\nthen twice fired his pistol close to a native.  The man both times\r\nlooked astounded, and carefully but quickly rubbed his head; he then\r\nstared awhile, and gabbled to his companions, but he never seemed to\r\nthink of running away.  We can hardly put ourselves in the position of\r\nthese savages, and understand their actions.  In the case of this\r\nFuegian, the possibility of such a sound as the report of a gun close\r\nto his ear could never have entered his mind.  He perhaps literally did\r\nnot for a second know whether it was a sound or a blow, and therefore\r\nvery naturally rubbed his head.  In a similar manner, when a savage\r\nsees a mark struck by a bullet, it may be some time before he is able\r\nat all to understand how it is effected; for the fact of a body being\r\ninvisible from its velocity would perhaps be to him an idea totally\r\ninconceivable.  Moreover, the extreme force of a bullet, that\r\npenetrates a hard substance without tearing it, may convince the savage\r\nthat it has no force at all.  Certainly I believe that many savages of\r\nthe lowest grade, such as these of Tierra del Fuego, have seen objects\r\nstruck, and even small animals killed by the musket, without being in\r\nthe least aware how deadly an instrument it is.\r\n\r\n22nd.--After having passed an unmolested night, in what would appear to\r\nbe neutral territory between Jemmy's tribe and the people whom we saw\r\nyesterday, we sailed pleasantly along.  I do not know anything which\r\nshows more clearly the hostile state of the different tribes, than\r\nthese wide border or neutral tracts.  Although Jemmy Button well knew\r\nthe force of our party, he was, at first, unwilling to land amidst the\r\nhostile tribe nearest to his own.  He often told us how the savage Oens\r\nmen \"when the leaf red,\" crossed the mountains from the eastern coast\r\nof Tierra del Fuego, and made inroads on the natives of this part of\r\nthe country.  It was most curious to watch him when thus talking, and\r\nsee his eyes gleaming and his whole face assume a new and wild\r\nexpression.  As we proceeded along the Beagle Channel, the scenery\r\nassumed a peculiar and very magnificent character; but the effect was\r\nmuch lessened from the lowness of the point of view in a boat, and from\r\nlooking along the valley, and thus losing all the beauty of a\r\nsuccession of ridges.  The mountains were here about three thousand\r\nfeet high, and terminated in sharp and jagged points.  They rose in one\r\nunbroken sweep from the water's edge, and were covered to the height of\r\nfourteen or fifteen hundred feet by the dusky-coloured forest.  It was\r\nmost curious to observe, as far as the eye could range, how level and\r\ntruly horizontal the line on the mountain side was, at which trees\r\nceased to grow: it precisely resembled the high-water mark of\r\ndrift-weed on a sea-beach.\r\n\r\nAt night we slept close to the junction of Ponsonby Sound with the\r\nBeagle Channel.  A small family of Fuegians, who were living in the\r\ncove, were quiet and inoffensive, and soon joined our party round a\r\nblazing fire.  We were well clothed, and though sitting close to the\r\nfire were far from too warm; yet these naked savages, though further\r\noff, were observed, to our great surprise, to be streaming with\r\nperspiration at undergoing such a roasting.  They seemed, however, very\r\nwell pleased, and all joined in the chorus of the seamen's songs: but\r\nthe manner in which they were invariably a little behindhand was quite\r\nludicrous.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the news had spread, and early in the morning (23rd) a\r\nfresh party arrived, belonging to the Tekenika, or Jemmy's tribe.\r\nSeveral of them had run so fast that their noses were bleeding, and\r\ntheir mouths frothed from the rapidity with which they talked; and with\r\ntheir naked bodies all bedaubed with black, white, [1] and red, they\r\nlooked like so many demoniacs who had been fighting.  We then proceeded\r\n(accompanied by twelve canoes, each holding four or five people) down\r\nPonsonby Sound to the spot where poor Jemmy expected to find his mother\r\nand relatives.  He had already heard that his father was dead; but as\r\nhe had had a \"dream in his head\" to that effect, he did not seem to\r\ncare much about it, and repeatedly comforted himself with the very\r\nnatural reflection--\"Me no help it.\" He was not able to learn any\r\nparticulars regarding his father's death, as his relations would not\r\nspeak about it.\r\n\r\nJemmy was now in a district well known to him, and guided the boats to\r\na quiet pretty cove named Woollya, surrounded by islets, every one of\r\nwhich and every point had its proper native name.  We found here a\r\nfamily of Jemmy's tribe, but not his relations: we made friends with\r\nthem; and in the evening they sent a canoe to inform Jemmy's mother and\r\nbrothers.  The cove was bordered by some acres of good sloping land,\r\nnot covered (as elsewhere) either by peat or by forest-trees.  Captain\r\nFitz Roy originally intended, as before stated, to have taken York\r\nMinster and Fuegia to their own tribe on the west coast; but as they\r\nexpressed a wish to remain here, and as the spot was singularly\r\nfavourable, Captain Fitz Roy determined to settle here the whole party,\r\nincluding Matthews, the missionary.  Five days were spent in building\r\nfor them three large wigwams, in landing their goods, in digging two\r\ngardens, and sowing seeds.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after our arrival (the 24th) the Fuegians began to\r\npour in, and Jemmy's mother and brothers arrived.  Jemmy recognised the\r\nstentorian voice of one of his brothers at a prodigious distance.  The\r\nmeeting was less interesting than that between a horse, turned out into\r\na field, when he joins an old companion.  There was no demonstration of\r\naffection; they simply stared for a short time at each other; and the\r\nmother immediately went to look after her canoe.  We heard, however,\r\nthrough York that the mother has been inconsolable for the loss of\r\nJemmy and had searched everywhere for him, thinking that he might have\r\nbeen left after having been taken in the boat.  The women took much\r\nnotice of and were very kind to Fuegia.  We had already perceived that\r\nJemmy had almost forgotten his own language.  I should think there was\r\nscarcely another human being with so small a stock of language, for his\r\nEnglish was very imperfect.  It was laughable, but almost pitiable, to\r\nhear him speak to his wild brother in English, and then ask him in\r\nSpanish (\"no sabe?\") whether he did not understand him.\r\n\r\nEverything went on peaceably during the three next days whilst the\r\ngardens were digging and wigwams building.  We estimated the number of\r\nnatives at about one hundred and twenty.  The women worked hard, whilst\r\nthe men lounged about all day long, watching us.  They asked for\r\neverything they saw, and stole what they could.  They were delighted at\r\nour dancing and singing, and were particularly interested at seeing us\r\nwash in a neighbouring brook; they did not pay much attention to\r\nanything else, not even to our boats.  Of all the things which York\r\nsaw, during his absence from his country, nothing seems more to have\r\nastonished him than an ostrich, near Maldonado: breathless with\r\nastonishment he came running to Mr. Bynoe, with whom he was out\r\nwalking--\"Oh, Mr. Bynoe, oh, bird all same horse!\" Much as our white\r\nskins surprised the natives, by Mr. Low's account a negro-cook to a\r\nsealing vessel, did so more effectually, and the poor fellow was so\r\nmobbed and shouted at that he would never go on shore again.\r\nEverything went on so quietly that some of the officers and myself took\r\nlong walks in the surrounding hills and woods.  Suddenly, however, on\r\nthe 27th, every woman and child disappeared.  We were all uneasy at\r\nthis, as neither York nor Jemmy could make out the cause.  It was\r\nthought by some that they had been frightened by our cleaning and\r\nfiring off our muskets on the previous evening; by others, that it was\r\nowing to offence taken by an old savage, who, when told to keep further\r\noff, had coolly spit in the sentry's face, and had then, by gestures\r\nacted over a sleeping Fuegian, plainly showed, as it was said, that he\r\nshould like to cut up and eat our man.  Captain Fitz Roy, to avoid the\r\nchance of an encounter, which would have been fatal to so many of the\r\nFuegians, thought it advisable for us to sleep at a cove a few miles\r\ndistant. Matthews, with his usual quiet fortitude (remarkable in a man\r\napparently possessing little energy of character), determined to stay\r\nwith the Fuegians, who evinced no alarm for themselves; and so we left\r\nthem to pass their first awful night.\r\n\r\nOn our return in the morning (28th) we were delighted to find all\r\nquiet, and the men employed in their canoes spearing fish.  Captain\r\nFitz Roy determined to send the yawl and one whale-boat back to the\r\nship; and to proceed with the two other boats, one under his own\r\ncommand (in which he most kindly allowed me to accompany him), and one\r\nunder Mr. Hammond, to survey the western parts of the Beagle Channel,\r\nand afterwards to return and visit the settlement.  The day to our\r\nastonishment was overpoweringly hot, so that our skins were scorched:\r\nwith this beautiful weather, the view in the middle of the Beagle\r\nChannel was very remarkable.  Looking towards either hand, no object\r\nintercepted the vanishing points of this long canal between the\r\nmountains.  The circumstance of its being an arm of the sea was\r\nrendered very evident by several huge whales [2] spouting in different\r\ndirections.  On one occasion I saw two of these monsters, probably male\r\nand female, slowly swimming one after the other, within less than a\r\nstone's throw of the shore, over which the beech-tree extended its\r\nbranches. We sailed on till it was dark, and then pitched our tents in\r\na quiet creek.  The greatest luxury was to find for our beds a beach of\r\npebbles, for they were dry and yielded to the body.  Peaty soil is\r\ndamp; rock is uneven and hard; sand gets into one's meat, when cooked\r\nand eaten boat-fashion; but when lying in our blanket-bags, on a good\r\nbed of smooth pebbles, we passed most comfortable nights.\r\n\r\nIt was my watch till one o'clock.  There is something very solemn in\r\nthese scenes.  At no time does the consciousness in what a remote\r\ncorner of the world you are then standing, come so strongly before the\r\nmind.  Everything tends to this effect; the stillness of the night is\r\ninterrupted only by the heavy breathing of the seamen beneath the\r\ntents, and sometimes by the cry of a night-bird.  The occasional\r\nbarking of a dog, heard in the distance, reminds one that it is  the\r\nland of the savage.\r\n\r\nJanuary 20th.--Early in the morning we arrived at the point where the\r\nBeagle Channel divides into two arms; and we entered the northern one.\r\nThe scenery here becomes even grander than before.  The lofty mountains\r\non the north side compose the granitic axis, or backbone of the country\r\nand boldly rise to a height of between three and four thousand feet,\r\nwith one peak above six thousand feet.  They are covered by a wide\r\nmantle of perpetual snow, and numerous cascades pour their waters,\r\nthrough the woods, into the narrow channel below.  In many parts,\r\nmagnificent glaciers extend from the mountain side to the water's edge.\r\nIt is scarcely possible to imagine anything more beautiful than the\r\nberyl-like blue of these glaciers, and especially as contrasted with\r\nthe dead white of the upper expanse of snow. The fragments which had\r\nfallen from the glacier into the water were floating away, and the\r\nchannel with its icebergs presented, for the space of a mile, a\r\nminiature likeness of the Polar Sea.  The boats being hauled on shore\r\nat our dinner-hour, we were admiring from the distance of half a mile a\r\nperpendicular cliff of ice, and were wishing that some more fragments\r\nwould fall.  At last, down came a mass with a roaring noise, and\r\nimmediately we saw the smooth outline of a wave travelling towards us.\r\nThe men ran down as quickly as they could to the boats; for the chance\r\nof their being dashed to pieces was evident.  One of the seamen just\r\ncaught hold of the bows, as the curling breaker reached it: he was\r\nknocked over and over, but not hurt, and the boats though thrice lifted\r\non high and let fall again, received no damage.  This was most\r\nfortunate for us, for we were a hundred miles distant from the ship,\r\nand we should have been left without provisions or fire-arms.  I had\r\npreviously observed that some large fragments of rock on the beach had\r\nbeen lately displaced; but until seeing this wave, I did not understand\r\nthe cause.  One side of the creek was formed by a spur of mica-slate;\r\nthe head by a cliff of ice about forty feet high; and the other side by\r\na promontory fifty feet high, built up of huge rounded fragments of\r\ngranite and mica-slate, out of which old trees were growing.  This\r\npromontory was evidently a moraine, heaped up at a period when the\r\nglacier had greater dimensions.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the western mouth of this northern branch of the Beagle\r\nChannel, we sailed amongst many unknown desolate islands, and the\r\nweather was wretchedly bad. We met with no natives.  The coast was\r\nalmost everywhere so steep, that we had several times to pull many\r\nmiles before we could find space enough to pitch our two tents: one\r\nnight we slept on large round boulders, with putrefying sea-weed\r\nbetween them; and when the tide rose, we had to get up and move our\r\nblanket-bags.  The farthest point westward which we reached was Stewart\r\nIsland, a distance of about one hundred and fifty miles from our ship.\r\nWe returned into the Beagle Channel by the southern arm, and thence\r\nproceeded, with no adventure, back to Ponsonby Sound.\r\n\r\nFebruary 6th.--We arrived at Woollya.  Matthews gave so bad an account\r\nof the conduct of the Fuegians, that Captain Fitz Roy determined to\r\ntake him back to the Beagle; and ultimately he was left at New Zealand,\r\nwhere his brother was a missionary.  From the time of our leaving, a\r\nregular system of plunder commenced; fresh parties of the natives kept\r\narriving: York and Jemmy lost many things, and Matthews almost\r\neverything which had not been concealed underground. Every article\r\nseemed to have been torn up and divided by the natives. Matthews\r\ndescribed the watch he was obliged always to keep as most harassing;\r\nnight and day he was surrounded by the natives, who tried to tire him\r\nout by making an incessant noise close to his head.  One day an old\r\nman, whom Matthews asked to leave his wigwam, immediately returned with\r\na large stone in his hand: another day a whole party came armed with\r\nstones and stakes, and some of the younger men and Jemmy's brother were\r\ncrying: Matthews met them with presents.  Another party showed by signs\r\nthat they wished to strip him naked and pluck all the hairs out of his\r\nface and body.  I think we arrived just in time to save his life.\r\nJemmy's relatives had been so vain and foolish, that they had showed to\r\nstrangers their plunder, and their manner of obtaining it.  It was\r\nquite melancholy leaving the three Fuegians with their savage\r\ncountrymen; but it was a great comfort that they had no personal fears.\r\nYork, being a powerful resolute man, was pretty sure to get on well,\r\ntogether with his wife Fuegia.  Poor Jemmy looked rather disconsolate,\r\nand would then, I have little doubt, have been glad to have returned\r\nwith us.  His own brother had stolen many things from him; and as he\r\nremarked, \"What fashion call that:\" he abused his countrymen, \"all bad\r\nmen, no sabe (know) nothing\" and, though I never heard him swear\r\nbefore, \"damned fools.\" Our three Fuegians, though they had been only\r\nthree years with civilized men, would, I am sure, have been glad to\r\nhave retained their new habits; but this was obviously impossible.  I\r\nfear it is more than doubtful, whether their visit will have been of\r\nany use to them.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, with Matthews on board, we made sail back to the ship,\r\nnot by the Beagle Channel, but by the southern coast.  The boats were\r\nheavily laden and the sea rough, and we had a dangerous passage.  By\r\nthe evening of the 7th we were on board the Beagle after an absence of\r\ntwenty days, during which time we had gone three hundred miles in the\r\nopen boats.  On the 11th, Captain Fitz Roy paid a visit by himself to\r\nthe Fuegians and found them going on well; and that they had lost very\r\nfew more things.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of February in the succeeding year (1834) the Beagle\r\nanchored in a beautiful little cove at the eastern entrance of the\r\nBeagle Channel.  Captain Fitz Roy determined on the bold, and as it\r\nproved successful, attempt to beat against the westerly winds by the\r\nsame route, which we had followed in the boats to the settlement at\r\nWoollya. We did not see many natives until we were near Ponsonby Sound,\r\nwhere we were followed by ten or twelve canoes.  The natives did not at\r\nall understand the reason of our tacking, and, instead of meeting us at\r\neach tack, vainly strove to follow us in our zigzag course.  I was\r\namused at finding what a difference the circumstance of being quite\r\nsuperior in force made, in the interest of beholding these savages.\r\nWhile in the boats I got to hate the very sound of their voices, so\r\nmuch trouble did they give us.  The first and last word was\r\n\"yammerschooner.\" When, entering some quiet little cove, we have looked\r\nround and thought to pass a quiet night, the odious word\r\n\"yammerschooner\" has shrilly sounded from some gloomy nook, and then\r\nthe little signal-smoke has curled up to spread the news far and wide.\r\nOn leaving some place we have said to each other, \"Thank heaven, we\r\nhave at last fairly left these wretches!\" when one more faint hallo\r\nfrom an all-powerful voice, heard at a prodigious distance, would reach\r\nour ears, and clearly could we distinguish--\"yammerschooner.\" But now,\r\nthe more Fuegians the merrier; and very merry work it was.  Both\r\nparties laughing, wondering, gaping at each other; we pitying them, for\r\ngiving us good fish and crabs for rags, etc.; they grasping at the\r\nchance of finding people so foolish as to exchange such splendid\r\nornaments for a good supper.  It was most amusing to see the\r\nundisguised smile of satisfaction with which one young woman with her\r\nface painted black, tied several bits of scarlet cloth round her head\r\nwith rushes.  Her husband, who enjoyed the very universal privilege in\r\nthis country of possessing two wives, evidently became jealous of all\r\nthe attention paid to his young wife; and, after a consultation with\r\nhis naked beauties, was paddled away by them.\r\n\r\nSome of the Fuegians plainly showed that they had a fair notion of\r\nbarter.  I gave one man a large nail (a most valuable present) without\r\nmaking any signs for a return; but he immediately picked out two fish,\r\nand handed them up on the point of his spear.  If any present was\r\ndesigned for one canoe, and it fell near another, it was invariably\r\ngiven to the right owner.  The Fuegian boy, whom Mr. Low had on board\r\nshowed, by going into the most violent passion, that he quite\r\nunderstood the reproach of being called a liar, which in truth he was.\r\nWe were this time, as on all former occasions, much surprised at the\r\nlittle notice, or rather none whatever, which was taken of many things,\r\nthe use of which must have been evident to the natives.  Simple\r\ncircumstances--such as the beauty of scarlet cloth or blue beads, the\r\nabsence of women, our care in washing ourselves,--excited their\r\nadmiration far more than any grand or complicated object, such as our\r\nship.  Bougainville has well remarked concerning these people, that\r\nthey treat the \"chefs d'oeuvre de l'industrie humaine, comme ils\r\ntraitent les loix de la nature et ses phenomenes.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of March, we anchored in a cove at Woollya, but we saw not a\r\nsoul there.  We were alarmed at this, for the natives in Ponsonby Sound\r\nshowed by gestures, that there had been fighting; and we afterwards\r\nheard that the dreaded Oens men had made a descent.  Soon a canoe, with\r\na little flag flying, was seen approaching, with one of the men in it\r\nwashing the paint off his face.  This man was poor Jemmy,--now a thin,\r\nhaggard savage, with long disordered hair, and naked, except a bit of\r\nblanket round his waist.  We did not recognize him till he was close to\r\nus, for he was ashamed of himself, and turned his back to the ship.  We\r\nhad left him plump, fat, clean, and well-dressed;--I never saw so\r\ncomplete and grievous a change.  As soon, however, as he was clothed,\r\nand the first flurry was over, things wore a good appearance. He dined\r\nwith Captain Fitz Roy, and ate his dinner as tidily as formerly.  He\r\ntold us that he had \"too much\" (meaning enough) to eat, that he was not\r\ncold, that his relations were very good people, and that he did not\r\nwish to go back to England: in the evening we found out the cause of\r\nthis great change in Jemmy's feelings, in the arrival of his young and\r\nnice-looking wife.  With his usual good feeling he brought two\r\nbeautiful otter-skins for two of his best friends, and some spear-heads\r\nand arrows made with his own hands for the Captain.  He said he had\r\nbuilt a canoe for himself, and he boasted that he could talk a little\r\nof his own language!  But it is a most singular fact, that he appears\r\nto have taught all his tribe some English: an old man spontaneously\r\nannounced \"Jemmy Button's wife.\" Jemmy had lost all his property.  He\r\ntold us that York Minster had built a large canoe, and with his wife\r\nFuegia, [3] had several months since gone to his own country, and had\r\ntaken farewell by an act of consummate villainy; he persuaded Jemmy and\r\nhis mother to come with him, and then on the way deserted them by\r\nnight, stealing every article of their property.\r\n\r\nJemmy went to sleep on shore, and in the morning returned, and remained\r\non board till the ship got under way, which frightened his wife, who\r\ncontinued crying violently till he got into his canoe.  He returned\r\nloaded with valuable property.  Every soul on board was heartily sorry\r\nto shake hands with him for the last time.  I do not now doubt that he\r\nwill be as happy as, perhaps happier than, if he had never left his own\r\ncountry.  Every one must sincerely hope that Captain Fitz Roy's noble\r\nhope may be fulfilled, of being rewarded for the many generous\r\nsacrifices which he made for these Fuegians, by some shipwrecked sailor\r\nbeing protected by the descendants of Jemmy Button and his tribe!  When\r\nJemmy reached the shore, he lighted a signal fire, and the smoke curled\r\nup, bidding us a last and long farewell, as the ship stood on her\r\ncourse into the open sea.\r\n\r\nThe perfect equality among the individuals composing the Fuegian tribes\r\nmust for a long time retard their civilization. As we see those\r\nanimals, whose instinct compels them to live in society and obey a\r\nchief, are most capable of improvement, so is it with the races of\r\nmankind.  Whether we look at it as a cause or a consequence, the more\r\ncivilized always have the most artificial governments.  For instance,\r\nthe inhabitants of Otaheite, who, when first discovered, were governed\r\nby hereditary kings, had arrived at a far higher grade than another\r\nbranch of the same people, the New Zealanders,--who, although benefited\r\nby being compelled to turn their attention to agriculture, were\r\nrepublicans in the most absolute sense.  In Tierra del Fuego, until\r\nsome chief shall arise with power sufficient to secure any acquired\r\nadvantage, such as the domesticated animals, it seems scarcely possible\r\nthat the political state of the country can be improved.  At present,\r\neven a piece of cloth given to one is torn into shreds and distributed;\r\nand no one individual becomes richer than another.  On the other hand,\r\nit is difficult to understand how a chief can arise till there is\r\nproperty of some sort by which he might manifest his superiority and\r\nincrease his power.\r\n\r\nI believe, in this extreme part of South America, man exists in a lower\r\nstate of improvement than in any other part of the world.  The South\r\nSea Islanders, of the two races inhabiting the Pacific, are\r\ncomparatively civilized.  The Esquimau in his subterranean hut, enjoys\r\nsome of the comforts of life, and in his canoe, when fully equipped,\r\nmanifests much skill.  Some of the tribes of Southern Africa prowling\r\nabout in search of roots, and living concealed on the wild and arid\r\nplains, are sufficiently wretched.  The Australian, in the simplicity\r\nof the arts of life, comes nearest the Fuegian: he can, however, boast\r\nof his boomerang, his spear and throwing-stick, his method of climbing\r\ntrees, of tracking animals, and of hunting.  Although the Australian\r\nmay be superior in acquirements, it by no means follows that he is\r\nlikewise superior in mental capacity: indeed, from what I saw of the\r\nFuegians when on board and from what I have read of the Australians, I\r\nshould think the case was exactly the reverse.\r\n\r\n[1] This substance, when dry, is tolerably compact, and of little\r\nspecific gravity: Professor Ehrenberg has examined it: he states (Konig\r\nAkad. der Wissen: Berlin, Feb. 1845) that it is composed of infusoria,\r\nincluding fourteen polygastrica, and four phytolitharia.  He says that\r\nthey are all inhabitants of fresh-water; this is a beautiful example of\r\nthe results obtainable through Professor Ehrenberg's microscopic\r\nresearches; for Jemmy Button told me that it is always collected at the\r\nbottoms of mountain-brooks.  It is, moreover, a striking fact that in\r\nthe geographical distribution of the infusoria, which are well known to\r\nhave very wide ranges, that all the species in this substance, although\r\nbrought from the extreme southern point of Tierra del Fuego, are old,\r\nknown forms.\r\n\r\n[2] One day, off the East coast of Tierra del Fuego, we saw a grand\r\nsight in several spermaceti whales jumping upright quite out of the\r\nwater, with the exception of their tail-fins. As they fell down\r\nsideways, they splashed the water high up, and the sound reverberated\r\nlike a distant broadside.\r\n\r\n[3] Captain Sulivan, who, since his voyage in the Beagle, has been\r\nemployed on the survey of the Falkland Islands, heard from a sealer in\r\n(1842?), that when in the western part of the Strait of Magellan, he\r\nwas astonished by a native woman coming on board, who could talk some\r\nEnglish.  Without doubt this was Fuega Basket.  She lived (I fear the\r\nterm probably bears a double interpretation) some days on board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSTRAIT OF MAGELLAN.--CLIMATE OF THE SOUTHERN COASTS\r\n\r\nStrait of Magellan--Port Famine--Ascent of Mount Tarn--Forests--Edible\r\nFungus--Zoology--Great Sea-weed--Leave Tierra del\r\nFuego--Climate--Fruit-trees and Productions of the Southern\r\nCoasts--Height of Snow-line on the Cordillera--Descent of Glaciers to\r\nthe Sea--Icebergs formed--Transportal of Boulders--Climate and\r\nProductions of the Antarctic Islands--Preservation of Frozen\r\nCarcasses--Recapitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE end of May, 1834, we entered for a second time the eastern mouth\r\nof the Strait of Magellan.  The country on both sides of this part of\r\nthe Strait consists of nearly level plains, like those of Patagonia.\r\nCape Negro, a little within the second Narrows, may be considered as\r\nthe point where the land begins to assume the marked features of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego.  On the east coast, south of the Strait, broken park-like\r\nscenery in a like manner connects these two countries, which are\r\nopposed to each other in almost every feature.  It is truly surprising\r\nto find in a space of twenty miles such a change in the landscape.  If\r\nwe take a rather greater distance, as between Port Famine and Gregory\r\nBay, that is about sixty miles, the difference is still more wonderful.\r\nAt the former place, we have rounded mountains concealed by impervious\r\nforests, which are drenched with the rain, brought by an endless\r\nsuccession of gales; while at Cape Gregory, there is a clear and bright\r\nblue sky over the dry and sterile plains.  The atmospheric currents,\r\n[1] although rapid, turbulent, and unconfined by any apparent limits,\r\nyet seem to follow, like a river in its bed, a regularly determined\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nDuring our previous visit (in January), we had an interview at Cape\r\nGregory with the famous so-called gigantic Patagonians, who gave us a\r\ncordial reception.  Their height appears greater than it really is,\r\nfrom their large guanaco mantles, their long flowing hair, and general\r\nfigure: on an average, their height is about six feet, with some men\r\ntaller and only a few shorter; and the women are also tall; altogether\r\nthey are certainly the tallest race which we anywhere saw.  In features\r\nthey strikingly resemble the more northern Indians whom I saw with\r\nRosas, but they have a wilder and more formidable appearance: their\r\nfaces were much painted with red and black, and one man was ringed and\r\ndotted with white like a Fuegian.  Captain Fitz Roy offered to take any\r\nthree of them on board, and all seemed determined to be of the three.\r\nIt was long before we could clear the boat; at last we got on board\r\nwith our three giants, who dined with the Captain, and behaved quite\r\nlike gentlemen, helping themselves with knives, forks, and spoons:\r\nnothing was so much relished as sugar.  This tribe has had so much\r\ncommunication with sealers and whalers that most of the men can speak a\r\nlittle English and Spanish; and they are half civilized, and\r\nproportionally demoralized.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a large party went on shore, to barter for skins and\r\nostrich-feathers; fire-arms being refused, tobacco was in greatest\r\nrequest, far more so than axes or tools.  The whole population of the\r\ntoldos, men, women, and children, were arranged on a bank.  It was an\r\namusing scene, and it was impossible not to like the so-called giants,\r\nthey were so thoroughly good-humoured and unsuspecting: they asked us\r\nto come again.  They seem to like to have Europeans to live with them;\r\nand old Maria, an important woman in the tribe, once begged Mr. Low to\r\nleave any one of his sailors with them.  They spend the greater part of\r\nthe year here; but in summer they hunt along the foot of the\r\nCordillera: sometimes they travel as far as the Rio Negro 750 miles to\r\nthe north.  They are well stocked with horses, each man having,\r\naccording to Mr. Low, six or seven, and all the women, and even\r\nchildren, their one own horse.  In the time of Sarmiento (1580), these\r\nIndians had bows and arrows, now long since disused; they then also\r\npossessed some horses.  This is a very curious fact, showing the\r\nextraordinarily rapid multiplication of horses in South America. The\r\nhorse was first landed at Buenos Ayres in 1537, and the colony being\r\nthen for a time deserted, the horse ran wild; [2] in 1580, only\r\nforty-three years afterwards, we hear of them at the Strait of\r\nMagellan!  Mr. Low informs me, that a neighbouring tribe of\r\nfoot-Indians is now changing into horse-Indians: the tribe at Gregory\r\nBay giving them their worn-out horses, and sending in winter a few of\r\ntheir best skilled men to hunt for them.\r\n\r\nJune 1st.--We anchored in the fine bay of Port Famine. It was now the\r\nbeginning of winter, and I never saw a more cheerless prospect; the\r\ndusky woods, piebald with snow, could be only seen indistinctly,\r\nthrough a drizzling hazy atmosphere.  We were, however, lucky in\r\ngetting two fine days.  On one of these, Mount Sarmiento, a distant\r\nmountain 6800 feet high, presented a very noble spectacle.  I was\r\nfrequently surprised in the scenery of Tierra del Fuego, at the little\r\napparent elevation of mountains really lofty.  I suspect it is owing to\r\na cause which would not at first be imagined, namely, that the whole\r\nmass, from the summit to the water's edge, is generally in full view. I\r\nremember having seen a mountain, first from the Beagle Channel, where\r\nthe whole sweep from the summit to the base was full in view, and then\r\nfrom Ponsonby Sound across several successive ridges; and it was\r\ncurious to observe in the latter case, as each fresh ridge afforded\r\nfresh means of judging of the distance, how the mountain rose in height.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching Port Famine, two men were seen running along the shore\r\nand hailing the ship.  A boat was sent for them.  They turned out to be\r\ntwo sailors who had run away from a sealing-vessel, and had joined the\r\nPatagonians.  These Indians had treated them with their usual\r\ndisinterested hospitality.  They had parted company through accident,\r\nand were then proceeding to Port Famine in hopes of finding some ship.\r\nI dare say they were worthless vagabonds, but I never saw more\r\nmiserable-looking ones.  They had been living for some days on\r\nmussel-shells and berries, and their tattered clothes had been burnt by\r\nsleeping so near their fires. They had been exposed night and day,\r\nwithout any shelter, to the late incessant gales, with rain, sleet, and\r\nsnow, and yet they were in good health.\r\n\r\nDuring our stay at Port Famine, the Fuegians twice came and plagued us.\r\nAs there were many instruments, clothes, and men on shore, it was\r\nthought necessary to frighten them away.  The first time a few great\r\nguns were fired, when they were far distant.  It was most ludicrous to\r\nwatch through a glass the Indians, as often as the shot struck the\r\nwater, take up stones, and, as a bold defiance, throw them towards the\r\nship, though about a mile and a half distant!  A boat was sent with\r\norders to fire a few musket-shots wide of them. The Fuegians hid\r\nthemselves behind the trees, and for every discharge of the muskets\r\nthey fired their arrows; all, however, fell short of the boat, and the\r\nofficer as he pointed at them laughed.  This made the Fuegians frantic\r\nwith passion, and they shook their mantles in vain rage.  At last,\r\nseeing the balls cut and strike the trees, they ran away, and we were\r\nleft in peace and quietness.  During the former voyage the Fuegians\r\nwere here very troublesome, and to frighten them a rocket was fired at\r\nnight over their wigwams; it answered effectually, and one of the\r\nofficers told me that the clamour first raised, and the barking of the\r\ndogs, was quite ludicrous in contrast with the profound silence which\r\nin a minute or two afterwards prevailed.  The next morning not a single\r\nFuegian was in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhen the Beagle was here in the month of February, I started one\r\nmorning at four o'clock to ascend Mount Tarn, which is 2600 feet high,\r\nand is the most elevated point in this immediate district.  We went in\r\na boat to the foot of the mountain (but unluckily not to the best\r\npart), and then began our ascent.  The forest commences at the line of\r\nhigh-water mark, and during the first two hours I gave over all hopes\r\nof reaching the summit.  So thick was the wood, that it was necessary\r\nto have constant recourse to the compass; for every landmark, though in\r\na mountainous country, was completely shut out.  In the deep ravines,\r\nthe death-like scene of desolation exceeded all description; outside it\r\nwas blowing a gale, but in these hollows, not even a breath of wind\r\nstirred the leaves of the tallest trees.  So gloomy, cold, and wet was\r\nevery part, that not even the fungi, mosses, or ferns could flourish.\r\nIn the valleys it was scarcely possible to crawl along, they were so\r\ncompletely barricaded by great mouldering trunks, which had fallen down\r\nin every direction. When passing over these natural bridges, one's\r\ncourse was often arrested by sinking knee deep into the rotten wood; at\r\nother times, when attempting to lean against a firm tree, one was\r\nstartled by finding a mass of decayed matter ready to fall at the\r\nslightest touch.  We at last found ourselves among the stunted trees,\r\nand then soon reached the bare ridge, which conducted us to the summit.\r\nHere was a view characteristic of Tierra del Fuego; irregular chains of\r\nhills, mottled with patches of snow, deep yellowish-green valleys, and\r\narms of the sea intersecting the land in many directions.  The strong\r\nwind was piercingly cold, and the atmosphere rather hazy, so that we\r\ndid not stay long on the top of the mountain.  Our descent was not\r\nquite so laborious as our ascent, for the weight of the body forced a\r\npassage, and all the slips and falls were in the right direction.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the sombre and dull character of the evergreen\r\nforests, [3] in which two or three species of trees grow, to the\r\nexclusion of all others.  Above the forest land, there are many dwarf\r\nalpine plants, which all spring from the mass of peat, and help to\r\ncompose it: these plants are very remarkable from their close alliance\r\nwith the species growing on the mountains of Europe, though so many\r\nthousand miles distant.  The central part of Tierra del Fuego, where\r\nthe clay-slate formation occurs, is most favourable to the growth of\r\ntrees; on the outer coast the poorer granitic soil, and a situation\r\nmore exposed to the violent winds, do not allow of their attaining any\r\ngreat size.  Near Port Famine I have seen more large trees than\r\nanywhere else: I measured a Winter's Bark which was four feet six\r\ninches in girth, and several of the beech were as much as thirteen\r\nfeet.  Captain King also mentions a beech which was seven feet in\r\ndiameter, seventeen feet above the roots.\r\n\r\nThere is one vegetable production deserving notice from its importance\r\nas an article of food to the Fuegians.  It is a globular, bright-yellow\r\nfungus, which grows in vast numbers on the beech-trees.  When young it\r\nis elastic and turgid, with\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\na smooth surface; but when mature it shrinks, becomes tougher, and has\r\nits entire surface deeply pitted or honey-combed, as represented in the\r\naccompanying woodcut.  This fungus belongs to a new and curious genus,\r\n[4] I found a second species on another species of beech in Chile: and\r\nDr. Hooker informs me, that just lately a third species has been\r\ndiscovered on a third species of beech in Van Diernan's Land.  How\r\nsingular is this relationship between parasitical fungi and the trees\r\non which they grow, in distant parts of the world!  In Tierra del Fuego\r\nthe fungus in its tough and mature state is collected in large\r\nquantities by the women and children, and is eaten un-cooked.  It has a\r\nmucilaginous, slightly sweet taste, with a faint smell like that of a\r\nmushroom.  With the exception of a few berries, chiefly of a dwarf\r\narbutus, the natives eat no vegetable food besides this fungus.  In New\r\nZealand, before the introduction of the potato, the roots of the fern\r\nwere largely consumed; at the present time, I believe, Tierra del Fuego\r\nis the only country in the world where a cryptogamic plant affords a\r\nstaple article of food.\r\n\r\nThe zoology of Tierra del Fuego, as might have been expected from the\r\nnature of its climate and vegetation, is very poor.  Of mammalia,\r\nbesides whales and seals, there is one bat, a kind of mouse (Reithrodon\r\nchinchilloides), two true mice, a ctenomys allied to or identical with\r\nthe tucutuco, two foxes (Canis Magellanicus and C. Azarae), a\r\nsea-otter, the guanaco, and a deer.  Most of these animals inhabit only\r\nthe drier eastern parts of the country; and the deer has never been\r\nseen south of the Strait of Magellan.  Observing the general\r\ncorrespondence of the cliffs of soft sandstone, mud, and shingle, on\r\nthe opposite sides of the Strait, and on some intervening islands, one\r\nis strongly tempted to believe that the land was once joined, and thus\r\nallowed animals so delicate and helpless as the tucutuco and Reithrodon\r\nto pass over. The correspondence of the cliffs is far from proving any\r\njunction; because such cliffs generally are formed by the intersection\r\nof sloping deposits, which, before the elevation of the land, had been\r\naccumulated near the then existing shores.  It is, however, a\r\nremarkable coincidence, that in the two large islands cut off by the\r\nBeagle Channel from the rest of Tierra del Fuego, one has cliffs\r\ncomposed of matter that may be called stratified alluvium, which front\r\nsimilar ones on the opposite side of the channel,--while the other is\r\nexclusively bordered by old crystalline rocks: in the former, called\r\nNavarin Island, both foxes and guanacos occur; but in the latter, Hoste\r\nIsland, although similar in every respect, and only separated by a\r\nchannel a little more than half a mile wide, I have the word of Jemmy\r\nButton for saying that neither of these animals are found.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy woods are inhabited by few birds: occasionally the plaintive\r\nnote of a white-tufted tyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius albiceps) may be\r\nheard, concealed near the summit of the most lofty trees; and more\r\nrarely the loud strange cry of a black wood-pecker, with a fine scarlet\r\ncrest on its head.  A little, dusky-coloured wren (Scytalopus\r\nMagellanicus) hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the\r\nfallen and decaying trunks.  But the creeper (Oxyurus tupinieri) is the\r\ncommonest bird in the country.  Throughout the beech forests, high up\r\nand low down, in the most gloomy, wet, and impenetrable ravines, it may\r\nbe met with. This little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it\r\nreally is, from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any\r\nperson who enters these silent woods: continually uttering a harsh\r\ntwitter, it flutters from tree to tree, within a few feet of the\r\nintruder's face.  It is far from wishing for the modest concealment of\r\nthe true creeper (Certhia familiaris); nor does it, like that bird, run\r\nup the trunks of trees, but industriously, after the manner of a\r\nwillow-wren, hops about, and searches for insects on every twig and\r\nbranch.  In the more open parts, three or four species of finches, a\r\nthrush, a starling (or Icterus), two Opetiorhynchi, and several hawks\r\nand owls occur.\r\n\r\nThe absence of any species whatever in the whole class of Reptiles, is\r\na marked feature in the zoology of this country, as well as in that of\r\nthe Falkland Islands.  I do not ground this statement merely on my own\r\nobservation, but I heard it from the Spanish inhabitants of the latter\r\nplace, and from Jemmy Button with regard to Tierra del Fuego.  On the\r\nbanks of the Santa Cruz, in 50 degs.  south, I saw a frog; and it is\r\nnot improbable that these animals, as well as lizards, may be found as\r\nfar south as the Strait of Magellan, where the country retains the\r\ncharacter of Patagonia; but within the damp and cold limit of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego not one occurs. That the climate would not have suited some\r\nof the orders, such as lizards, might have been foreseen; but with\r\nrespect to frogs, this was not so obvious.\r\n\r\nBeetles occur in very small numbers: it was long before I could believe\r\nthat a country as large as Scotland, covered with vegetable productions\r\nand with a variety of stations, could be so unproductive.  The few\r\nwhich I found were alpine species (Harpalidae and Heteromidae) living\r\nunder stones.  The vegetable-feeding Chrysomelidae, so eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the Tropics, are here almost entirely absent; [5] I\r\nsaw very few flies, butterflies, or bees, and no crickets or\r\nOrthoptera.  In the pools of water I found but a few aquatic beetles,\r\nand not any fresh-water shells: Succinea at first appears an exception;\r\nbut here it must be called a terrestrial shell, for it lives on the\r\ndamp herbage far from the water.  Land-shells could be procured only in\r\nthe same alpine situations with the beetles.  I have already contrasted\r\nthe climate as well as the general appearance of Tierra del Fuego with\r\nthat of Patagonia; and the difference is strongly exemplified in the\r\nentomology.  I do not believe they have one species in common;\r\ncertainly the general character of the insects is widely different.\r\n\r\nIf we turn from the land to the sea, we shall find the latter as\r\nabundantly stocked with living creatures as the former is poorly so. In\r\nall parts of the world a rocky and partially protected shore perhaps\r\nsupports, in a given space, a greater number of individual animals than\r\nany other station.  There is one marine production which, from its\r\nimportance, is worthy of a particular history.  It is the kelp, or\r\nMacrocystis pyrifera.  This plant grows on every rock from low-water\r\nmark to a great depth, both on the outer coast and within the channels.\r\n[6] I believe, during the voyages of the Adventure and Beagle, not one\r\nrock near the surface was discovered which was not buoyed by this\r\nfloating weed.  The good service it thus affords to vessels navigating\r\nnear this stormy land is evident; and it certainly has saved many a one\r\nfrom being wrecked.  I know few things more surprising than to see this\r\nplant growing and flourishing amidst those great breakers of the\r\nwestern ocean, which no mass of rock, let it be ever so hard, can long\r\nresist.  The stem is round, slimy, and smooth, and seldom has a\r\ndiameter of so much as an inch.  A few taken together are sufficiently\r\nstrong to support the weight of the large loose stones, to which in the\r\ninland channels they grow attached; and yet some of these stones were\r\nso heavy that when drawn to the surface, they could scarcely be lifted\r\ninto a boat by one person.  Captain Cook, in his second voyage, says,\r\nthat this plant at Kerguelen Land rises from a greater depth than\r\ntwenty-four fathoms; \"and as it does not grow in a perpendicular\r\ndirection, but makes a very acute angle with the bottom, and much of it\r\nafterwards spreads many fathoms on the surface of the sea, I am well\r\nwarranted to say that some of it grows to the length of sixty fathoms\r\nand upwards.\" I do not suppose the stem of any other plant attains so\r\ngreat a length as three hundred and sixty feet, as stated by Captain\r\nCook.  Captain Fitz Roy, moreover, found it growing [7] up from the\r\ngreater depth of forty-five fathoms.  The beds of this sea-weed, even\r\nwhen of not great breadth, make excellent natural floating breakwaters.\r\nIt is quite curious to see, in an exposed harbour, how soon the waves\r\nfrom the open sea, as they travel through the straggling stems, sink in\r\nheight, and pass into smooth water.\r\n\r\nThe number of living creatures of all Orders, whose existence\r\nintimately depends on the kelp, is wonderful.  A great volume might be\r\nwritten, describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of sea-weed.\r\nAlmost all the leaves, excepting those that float on the surface, are\r\nso thickly incrusted with corallines as to be of a white colour.  We\r\nfind exquisitely delicate structures, some inhabited by simple\r\nhydra-like polypi, others by more organized kinds, and beautiful\r\ncompound Ascidiae.  On the leaves, also, various patelliform shells,\r\nTrochi, uncovered molluscs, and some bivalves are attached. Innumerable\r\ncrustacea frequent every part of the plant.  On shaking the great\r\nentangled roots, a pile of small fish, shells, cuttle-fish, crabs of\r\nall orders, sea-eggs, star-fish, beautiful Holuthuriae, Planariae, and\r\ncrawling nereidous animals of a multitude of forms, all fall out\r\ntogether.  Often as I recurred to a branch of the kelp, I never failed\r\nto discover animals of new and curious structures.  In Chiloe, where\r\nthe kelp does not thrive very well, the numerous shells, corallines,\r\nand crustacea are absent; but there yet remain a few of the\r\nFlustraceae, and some compound Ascidiae; the latter, however, are of\r\ndifferent species from those in Tierra del Fuego: we see here the fucus\r\npossessing a wider range than the animals which use it as an abode.  I\r\ncan only compare these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere\r\nwith the terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions.  Yet if in any\r\ncountry a forest was destroyed, I do not believe nearly so many species\r\nof animals would perish as would here, from the destruction of the\r\nkelp.  Amidst the leaves of this plant numerous species of fish live,\r\nwhich nowhere else could find food or shelter; with their destruction\r\nthe many cormorants and other fishing birds, the otters, seals, and\r\nporpoises, would soon perish also; and lastly, the Fuegian savage, the\r\nmiserable lord of this miserable land, would redouble his cannibal\r\nfeast, decrease in numbers, and perhaps cease to exist.\r\n\r\nJune 8th.--We weighed anchor early in the morning and left Port Famine.\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy determined to leave the Strait of Magellan by the\r\nMagdalen Channel, which had not long been discovered.  Our course lay\r\ndue south, down that gloomy passage which I have before alluded to as\r\nappearing to lead to another and worse world.  The wind was fair, but\r\nthe atmosphere was very thick; so that we missed much curious scenery.\r\nThe dark ragged clouds were rapidly driven over the mountains, from\r\ntheir summits nearly down to their bases.  The glimpses which we caught\r\nthrough the dusky mass were highly interesting; jagged points, cones of\r\nsnow, blue glaciers, strong outlines, marked on a lurid sky, were seen\r\nat different distances and heights.  In the midst of such scenery we\r\nanchored at Cape Turn, close to Mount Sarmiento, which was then hidden\r\nin the clouds.  At the base of the lofty and almost perpendicular sides\r\nof our little cove there was one deserted wigwam, and it alone reminded\r\nus that man sometimes wandered into these desolate regions. But it\r\nwould be difficult to imagine a scene where he seemed to have fewer\r\nclaims or less authority.  The inanimate works of nature--rock, ice,\r\nsnow, wind, and water--all warring with each other, yet combined\r\nagainst man--here reigned in absolute sovereignty.\r\n\r\nJune 9th.--In the morning we were delighted by seeing the veil of mist\r\ngradually rise from Sarmiento, and display it to our view.  This\r\nmountain, which is one of the highest in Tierra del Fuego, has an\r\naltitude of 6800 feet.  Its base, for about an eighth of its total\r\nheight, is clothed by dusky woods, and above this a field of snow\r\nextends to the summit.  These vast piles of snow, which never melt, and\r\nseem destined to last as long as the world holds together, present a\r\nnoble and even sublime spectacle.  The outline of the mountain was\r\nadmirably clear and defined.  Owing to the abundance of light reflected\r\nfrom the white and glittering surface, no shadows were cast on any\r\npart; and those lines which intersected the sky could alone be\r\ndistinguished: hence the mass stood out in the boldest relief.  Several\r\nglaciers descended in a winding course from the upper great expanse of\r\nsnow to the sea-coast: they may be likened to great frozen Niagaras;\r\nand perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are full as beautiful as the\r\nmoving ones of water.  By night we reached the western part of the\r\nchannel; but the water was so deep that no anchorage could be found. We\r\nwere in consequence obliged to stand off and on in this narrow arm of\r\nthe sea, during a pitch-dark night of fourteen hours long.\r\n\r\nJune 10th.--In the morning we made the best of our way into the open\r\nPacific.  The western coast generally consists of low, rounded, quite\r\nbarren hills of granite and greenstone. Sir J. Narborough called one\r\npart South Desolation, because it is \"so desolate a land to behold:\"\r\nand well indeed might he say so.  Outside the main islands, there are\r\nnumberless scattered rocks on which the long swell of the open ocean\r\nincessantly rages.  We passed out between the East and West Furies; and\r\na little farther northward there are so many breakers that the sea is\r\ncalled the Milky Way.  One sight of such a coast is enough to make a\r\nlandsman dream for a week about shipwrecks, peril, and death; and with\r\nthis sight we bade farewell for ever to Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nThe following discussion on the climate of the southern parts of the\r\ncontinent with relation to its productions, on the snow-line, on the\r\nextraordinarily low descent of the glaciers, and on the zone of\r\nperpetual congelation in the antarctic islands, may be passed over by\r\nany one not interested in these curious subjects, or the final\r\nrecapitulation alone may be read.  I shall, however, here give only an\r\nabstract, and must refer for details to the Thirteenth Chapter and the\r\nAppendix of the former edition of this work.\r\n\r\nOn the Climate and Productions of Tierra del Fuego and of the\r\nSouth-west Coast.--The following table gives the mean temperature of\r\nTierra del Fuego, the Falkland Islands, and, for comparison, that of\r\nDublin:--\r\n\r\n                                 Summer   Winter   Mean of Summer\r\n                     Latitude    Temp.

Humming-birds may be seen sucking\r\nthe flowers, and parrots feeding on the seeds of the Winter's Bark, in\r\nlat. 55 degs. S. I have already remarked to what a degree the sea\r\nswarms with living creatures; and the shells (such as the Patellae,\r\nFissurellae, Chitons, and Barnacles), according to Mr. G. B. Sowerby,\r\nare of a much larger size and of a more vigorous growth, than the\r\nanalogous species in the northern hemisphere.  A large Voluta is\r\nabundant in southern Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands.  At\r\nBahia Blanca, in lat. 39 degs. S., the most abundant shells were three\r\nspecies of Oliva (one of large size), one or two Volutas, and a\r\nTerebra.  Now, these are amongst the best characterized tropical forms.\r\nIt is doubtful whether even one small species of Oliva exists on the\r\nsouthern shores of Europe, and there are no species of the two other\r\ngenera. If a geologist were to find in lat 39 degs. on the coast of\r\nPortugal a bed containing numerous shells belonging to three species of\r\nOliva, to a Voluta and Terebra, he would probably assert that the\r\nclimate at the period of their existence must have been tropical; but\r\njudging from South America, such an inference might be erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe equable, humid, and windy climate of Tierra del Fuego extends, with\r\nonly a small increase of heat, for many degrees along the west coast of\r\nthe continent.  The forests for 600 miles northward of Cape Horn, have\r\na very similar aspect.  As a proof of the equable climate, even for 300\r\nor 400 miles still further northward, I may mention that in Chiloe\r\n(corresponding in latitude with the northern parts of Spain) the peach\r\nseldom produces fruit, whilst strawberries and apples thrive to\r\nperfection.  Even the crops of barley and wheat [9] are often brought\r\ninto the houses to be dried and ripened.  At Valdivia (in the same\r\nlatitude of 40 degs., with Madrid) grapes and figs ripen, but are not\r\ncommon; olives seldom ripen even partially, and oranges not at all.\r\nThese fruits, in corresponding latitudes in Europe, are well known to\r\nsucceed to perfection; and even in this continent, at the Rio Negro,\r\nunder nearly the same parallel with Valdivia, sweet potatoes\r\n(convolvulus) are cultivated; and grapes, figs, olives, oranges, water\r\nand musk melons, produce abundant fruit.  Although the humid and\r\nequable climate of Chiloe, and of the coast northward and southward of\r\nit, is so unfavourable to our fruits, yet the native forests, from lat.\r\n45 to 38 degs., almost rival in luxuriance those of the glowing\r\nintertropical regions.  Stately trees of many kinds, with smooth and\r\nhighly coloured barks, are loaded by parasitical monocotyledonous\r\nplants; large and elegant ferns are numerous, and arborescent grasses\r\nentwine the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty or\r\nforty feet above the ground.  Palm-trees grow in lat 37 degs.; an\r\narborescent grass, very like a bamboo, in 40 degs.; and another closely\r\nallied kind, of great length, but not erect, flourishes even as far\r\nsouth as 45 degs. S.\r\n\r\nAn equable climate, evidently due to the large area of sea compared\r\nwith the land, seems to extend over the greater part of the southern\r\nhemisphere; and, as a consequence, the vegetation partakes of a\r\nsemi-tropical character.  Tree-ferns thrive luxuriantly in Van Diemen's\r\nLand (lat. 45 degs.), and I measured one trunk no less than six feet in\r\ncircumference. An arborescent fern was found by Forster in New Zealand\r\nin 46 degs., where orchideous plants are parasitical on the trees.  In\r\nthe Auckland Islands, ferns, according to Dr. Dieffenbach [10] have\r\ntrunks so thick and high that they may be almost called tree-ferns; and\r\nin these islands, and even as far south as lat. 55 degs. in the\r\nMacquarrie Islands, parrots abound.\r\n\r\nOn the Height of the Snow-line, and on the Descent of the Glaciers in\r\nSouth America.--For the detailed authorities for the following table, I\r\nmust refer to the former edition:--\r\n\r\n                                   Height in feet\r\n  Latitude                         of Snow-line    Observer\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Equatorial region; mean result   15,748           Humboldt.

S.    3,500 - 4,000    King.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the height of the plane of perpetual snow seems chiefly to be\r\ndetermined by the extreme heat of the summer, rather than by the mean\r\ntemperature of the year, we ought not to be surprised at its descent in\r\nthe Strait of Magellan, where the summer is so cool, to only 3500 or\r\n4000 feet above the level of the sea; although in Norway, we must\r\ntravel to between lat. 67 and 70 degs. N., that is, about 14 degs.\r\nnearer the pole, to meet with perpetual snow at this low level.  The\r\ndifference in height, namely, about 9000 feet, between the snow-line on\r\nthe Cordillera behind Chiloe (with its highest points ranging from only\r\n5600 to 7500 feet) and in central Chile [11] (a distance of only 9\r\ndegs. of latitude), is truly wonderful.  The land from the southward of\r\nChiloe to near Concepcion (lat. 37 degs.) is hidden by one dense forest\r\ndripping with moisture.  The sky is cloudy, and we have seen how badly\r\nthe fruits of southern Europe succeed.  In central Chile, on the other\r\nhand, a little northward of Concepcion, the sky is generally clear,\r\nrain does not fall for the seven summer months, and southern European\r\nfruits succeed admirably; and even the sugar-cane has been cultivated.\r\n[12] No doubt the plane of perpetual snow undergoes the above\r\nremarkable flexure of 9000 feet, unparalleled in other parts of the\r\nworld, not far from the latitude of Concepcion, where the land ceases\r\nto be covered with forest-trees; for trees in South America indicate a\r\nrainy climate, and rain a clouded sky and little heat in summer.\r\n\r\nThe descent of glaciers to the sea must, I conceive, mainly depend\r\n(subject, of course, to a proper supply of snow in the upper region) on\r\nthe lowness of the line of perpetual snow on steep mountains near the\r\ncoast.  As the snow-line is so low in Tierra del Fuego, we might have\r\nexpected that many of the glaciers would have reached the sea.\r\nNevertheless, I was astonished when I first saw a range, only from 3000\r\nto 4000 feet in height, in the latitude of Cumberland, with every\r\nvalley filled with streams of ice descending to the sea-coast. Almost\r\nevery arm of the sea, which penetrates to the interior higher chain,\r\nnot only in Tierra del Fuego, but on the coast for 650 miles\r\nnorthwards, is terminated by \"tremendous and astonishing glaciers,\" as\r\ndescribed by one of the officers on the survey.  Great masses of ice\r\nfrequently fall from these icy cliffs, and the crash reverberates like\r\nthe broadside of a man-of-war through the lonely channels.  These\r\nfalls, as noticed in the last chapter, produce great waves which break\r\non the adjoining coasts.  It is known that earthquakes frequently cause\r\nmasses of earth to fall from sea-cliffs: how terrific, then, would be\r\nthe effect of a severe shock (and such occur here [13]) on a body like\r\na glacier, already in motion, and traversed by fissures!  I can readily\r\nbelieve that the water would be fairly beaten back out of the deepest\r\nchannel, and then, returning with an overwhelming force, would whirl\r\nabout huge masses of rock like so much chaff.  In Eyre's Sound, in the\r\nlatitude of Paris, there are immense glaciers, and yet the loftiest\r\nneighbouring mountain is only 6200 feet high.  In this Sound, about\r\nfifty icebergs were seen at one time floating outwards, and one of them\r\nmust have been at least 168 feet in total height.  Some of the icebergs\r\nwere loaded with blocks of no inconsiderable size, of granite and other\r\nrocks, different from the clay-slate of the surrounding mountains.  The\r\nglacier furthest from the pole, surveyed during the voyages of the\r\nAdventure and Beagle, is in lat. 46 degs. 50', in the Gulf of Penas. It\r\nis 15 miles long, and in one part 7 broad and descends to the\r\nsea-coast.  But even a few miles northward of this glacier, in Laguna\r\nde San\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nRafael, some Spanish missionaries [14] encountered \"many icebergs, some\r\ngreat, some small, and others middle-sized,\" in a narrow arm of the\r\nsea, on the 22nd of the month corresponding with our June, and in a\r\nlatitude corresponding with that of the Lake of Geneva!\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the most southern glacier which comes down to the sea is met\r\nwith, according to Von Buch, on the coast of Norway, in lat. 67 degs.\r\nNow, this is more than 20 degs. of latitude, or 1230 miles, nearer the\r\npole than the Laguna de San Rafael.  The position of the glaciers at\r\nthis place and in the Gulf of Penas may be put even in a more striking\r\npoint of view, for they descend to the sea-coast within 7.5 degs. of\r\nlatitude, or 450 miles, of a harbour, where three species of Oliva, a\r\nVoluta, and a Terebra, are the commonest shells, within less than 9\r\ndegs. from where palms grow, within 4.5 degs. of a region where the\r\njaguar and puma range over the plains, less than 2.5 degs. from\r\narborescent grasses, and (looking to the westward in the same\r\nhemisphere) less than 2 degs. from orchideous parasites, and within a\r\nsingle degree of tree-ferns!\r\n\r\nThese facts are of high geological interest with respect to the climate\r\nof the northern hemisphere at the period when boulders were\r\ntransported.  I will not here detail how simply the theory of icebergs\r\nbeing charged with fragments of rock, explain the origin and position\r\nof the gigantic boulders of eastern Tierra del Fuego, on the high plain\r\nof Santa Cruz, and on the island of Chiloe.  In Tierra del Fuego, the\r\ngreater number of boulders lie on the lines of old sea-channels, now\r\nconverted into dry valleys by the elevation of the land.  They are\r\nassociated with a great unstratified formation of mud and sand,\r\ncontaining rounded and angular fragments of all sizes, which has\r\noriginated [15] in the repeated ploughing up of the sea-bottom by the\r\nstranding of icebergs, and by the matter transported on them.  Few\r\ngeologists now doubt that those erratic boulders which lie near lofty\r\nmountains have been pushed forward by the glaciers themselves, and that\r\nthose distant from mountains, and embedded in subaqueous deposits, have\r\nbeen conveyed thither either on icebergs or frozen in coast-ice.  The\r\nconnection between the transportal of boulders and the presence of ice\r\nin some form, is strikingly shown by their geographical distribution\r\nover the earth. In South America they are not found further than 48\r\ndegs. of latitude, measured from the southern pole; in North America it\r\nappears that the limit of their transportal extends to 53.5 degs. from\r\nthe northern pole; but in Europe to not more than 40 degs. of latitude,\r\nmeasured from the same point.  On the other hand, in the intertropical\r\nparts of America, Asia, and Africa, they have never been observed; nor\r\nat the Cape of Good Hope, nor in Australia. [16]\r\n\r\nOn the Climate and Productions of the Antarctic Islands.--Considering\r\nthe rankness of the vegetation in Tierra del Fuego, and on the coast\r\nnorthward of it, the condition of the islands south and south-west of\r\nAmerica is truly surprising. Sandwich Land, in the latitude of the\r\nnorth part of Scotland, was found by Cook, during the hottest month of\r\nthe year, \"covered many fathoms thick with everlasting snow;\" and there\r\nseems to be scarcely any vegetation.  Georgia, an island 96 miles long\r\nand 10 broad, in the latitude of Yorkshire, \"in the very height of\r\nsummer, is in a manner wholly covered with frozen snow.\" It can boast\r\nonly of moss, some tufts of grass, and wild burnet; it has only one\r\nland-bird (Anthus correndera), yet Iceland, which is 10 degs. nearer\r\nthe pole, has, according to Mackenzie, fifteen land-birds.  The South\r\nShetland Islands, in the same latitude as the southern half of Norway,\r\npossess only some lichens, moss, and a little grass; and Lieut. Kendall\r\n[17] found the bay, in which he was at anchor, beginning to freeze at a\r\nperiod corresponding with our 8th of September.  The soil here consists\r\nof ice and volcanic ashes interstratified; and at a little depth\r\nbeneath the surface it must remain perpetually congealed, for Lieut.\r\nKendall found the body of a foreign sailor which had long been buried,\r\nwith the flesh and all the features perfectly preserved.  It is a\r\nsingular fact, that on the two great continents in the northern\r\nhemisphere (but not in the broken land of Europe between them ), we\r\nhave the zone of perpetually frozen under-soil in a low\r\nlatitude--namely, in 56 degs. in North America at the depth of three\r\nfeet, [18] and in 62 degs. in Siberia at the depth of twelve to fifteen\r\nfeet--as the result of a directly opposite condition of things to those\r\nof the southern hemisphere.  On the northern continents, the winter is\r\nrendered excessively cold by the radiation from a large area of land\r\ninto a clear sky, nor is it moderated by the warmth-bringing currents\r\nof the sea; the short summer, on the other hand, is hot.  In the\r\nSouthern Ocean the winter is not so excessively cold, but the summer is\r\nfar less hot, for the clouded sky seldom allows the sun to warm the\r\nocean, itself a bad absorbent of heat: and hence the mean temperature\r\nof the year, which regulates the zone of perpetually congealed\r\nunder-soil, is low.  It is evident that a rank vegetation, which does\r\nnot so much require heat as it does protection from intense cold, would\r\napproach much nearer to this zone of perpetual congelation under the\r\nequable climate of the southern hemisphere, than under the extreme\r\nclimate of the northern continents.\r\n\r\nThe case of the sailor's body perfectly preserved in the icy soil of\r\nthe South Shetland Islands (lat. 62 to 63 degs. S.), in a rather lower\r\nlatitude than that (lat. 64 degs. N.) under which Pallas found the\r\nfrozen rhinoceros in Siberia, is very interesting.  Although it is a\r\nfallacy, as I have endeavoured to show in a former chapter, to suppose\r\nthat the larger quadrupeds require a luxuriant vegetation for their\r\nsupport, nevertheless it is important to find in the South Shetland\r\nIslands a frozen under-soil within 360 miles of the forest-clad islands\r\nnear Cape Horn, where, as far as the _bulk_ of vegetation is concerned,\r\nany number of great quadrupeds might be supported. The perfect\r\npreservation of the carcasses of the Siberian elephants and\r\nrhinoceroses is certainly one of the most wonderful facts in geology;\r\nbut independently of the imagined difficulty of supplying them with\r\nfood from the adjoining countries, the whole case is not, I think, so\r\nperplexing as it has generally been considered.  The plains of Siberia,\r\nlike those of the Pampas, appear to have been formed under the sea,\r\ninto which rivers brought down the bodies of many animals; of the\r\ngreater number of these, only the skeletons have been preserved, but of\r\nothers the perfect carcass.  Now, it is known that in the shallow sea\r\non the Arctic coast of America the bottom freezes, [19] and does not\r\nthaw in spring so soon as the surface of the land, moreover at greater\r\ndepths, where the bottom of the sea does not freeze the mud a few feet\r\nbeneath the top layer might remain even in summer below 32 degs., as in\r\nthe case on the land with the soil at the depth of a few feet.  At\r\nstill greater depths, the temperature of the mud and water would\r\nprobably not be low enough to preserve the flesh; and hence, carcasses\r\ndrifted beyond the shallow parts near an Arctic coast, would have only\r\ntheir skeletons preserved: now in the extreme northern parts of Siberia\r\nbones are infinitely numerous, so that even islets are said to be\r\nalmost composed of them; [20] and those islets lie no less than ten\r\ndegrees of latitude north of the place where Pallas found the frozen\r\nrhinoceros.  On the other hand, a carcass washed by a flood into a\r\nshallow part of the Arctic Sea, would be preserved for an indefinite\r\nperiod, if it were soon afterwards covered with mud sufficiently thick\r\nto prevent the heat of the summer-water penetrating to it; and if, when\r\nthe sea-bottom was upraised into land, the covering was sufficiently\r\nthick to prevent the heat of the summer air and sun thawing and\r\ncorrupting it.\r\n\r\nRecapitulation.--I will recapitulate the principal facts with regard to\r\nthe climate, ice-action, and organic productions of the southern\r\nhemisphere, transposing the places in imagination to Europe, with which\r\nwe are so much better acquainted. Then, near Lisbon, the commonest\r\nsea-shells, namely, three species of Oliva, a Voluta, and a Terebra,\r\nwould have a tropical character.  In the southern provinces of France,\r\nmagnificent forests, intwined by arborescent grasses and with the trees\r\nloaded with parasitical plants, would hide the face of the land.  The\r\npuma and the jaguar would haunt the Pyrenees.  In the latitude of Mont\r\nBlanc, but on an island as far westward as Central North America,\r\ntree-ferns and parasitical Orchideae would thrive amidst the thick\r\nwoods. Even as far north as central Denmark, humming-birds would be\r\nseen fluttering about delicate flowers, and parrots feeding amidst the\r\nevergreen woods; and in the sea there, we should have a Voluta, and all\r\nthe shells of large size and vigorous growth.  Nevertheless, on some\r\nislands only 360 miles northward of our new Cape Horn in Denmark, a\r\ncarcass buried in the soil (or if washed into a shallow sea, and\r\ncovered up with mud) would be preserved perpetually frozen.  If some\r\nbold navigator attempted to penetrate northward of these islands, he\r\nwould run a thousand dangers amidst gigantic icebergs, on some of which\r\nhe would see great blocks of rock borne far away from their original\r\nsite.  Another island of large size in the latitude of southern\r\nScotland, but twice as far to the west, would be \"almost wholly covered\r\nwith everlasting snow,\" and would have each bay terminated by\r\nice-cliffs, whence great masses would be yearly detached: this island\r\nwould boast only of a little moss, grass, and burnet, and a titlark\r\nwould be its only land inhabitant.  From our new Cape Horn in Denmark,\r\na chain of mountains, scarcely half the height of the Alps, would run\r\nin a straight line due southward; and on its western flank every deep\r\ncreek of the sea, or fiord, would end in \"bold and astonishing\r\nglaciers.\" These lonely channels would frequently reverberate with the\r\nfalls of ice, and so often would great waves rush along their coasts;\r\nnumerous icebergs, some as tall as cathedrals, and occasionally loaded\r\nwith \"no inconsiderable blocks of rock,\" would be stranded on the\r\noutlying islets; at intervals violent earthquakes would shoot\r\nprodigious masses of ice into the waters below.  Lastly, some\r\nmissionaries attempting to penetrate a long arm of the sea, would\r\nbehold the not lofty surrounding mountains, sending down their many\r\ngrand icy streams to the sea-coast, and their progress in the boats\r\nwould be checked by the innumerable floating icebergs, some small and\r\nsome great; and this would have occurred on our twenty-second of June,\r\nand where the Lake of Geneva is now spread out! [21]\r\n\r\n[1] The south-westerly breezes are generally very dry. January 29th,\r\nbeing at anchor under Cape Gregory: a very hard gale from W. by S.,\r\nclear sky with few cumuli; temperature 57 degs., dew-point 36\r\ndegs.,--difference 21 degs. On January 15th, at Port St. Julian: in the\r\nmorning, light winds with much rain, followed by a very heavy squall\r\nwith rain,--settled into heavy gale with large cumuli,--cleared up,\r\nblowing very strong from S.S.W.

S. 334.\r\n\r\n[3] Captain Fitz Roy informs me that in April (our October), the leaves\r\nof those trees which grow near the base of the mountains change colour,\r\nbut not those on the more elevated parts.  I remember having read some\r\nobservations, showing that in England the leaves fall earlier in a warm\r\nand fine autumn than in a late and cold one, The change in the colour\r\nbeing here retarded in the more elevated, and therefore colder\r\nsituations, must be owing to the same general law of vegetation. The\r\ntrees of Tierra del Fuego during no part of the year entirely shed\r\ntheir leaves.\r\n\r\n[4] Described from my specimens and notes by the Rev. J. M. Berkeley,\r\nin the Linnean Transactions (vol. xix. p. 37), under the name of\r\nCyttaria Darwinii; the Chilean species is the C. Berteroii.  This genus\r\nis allied to Bulgaria.\r\n\r\n[5] I believe I must except one alpine Haltica, and a single specimen\r\nof a Melasoma.  Mr. Waterhouse informs me, that of the Harpalidae there\r\nare eight or nine species--the forms of the greater number being very\r\npeculiar; of Heteromera, four or five species; of Rhyncophora, six or\r\nseven; and of the following families one species in each:\r\nStaphylinidae, Elateridae, Cebrionidae, Melolonthidae.  The species in\r\nthe other orders are even fewer.  In all the orders, the scarcity of\r\nthe individuals is even more remarkable than that of the species.  Most\r\nof the Coleoptera have been carefully described by Mr. Waterhouse in\r\nthe Annals of Nat. Hist.\r\n\r\n[6] Its geographical range is remarkably wide; it is found from the\r\nextreme southern islets near Cape Horn, as far north on the eastern\r\ncoast (according to information given me by Mr. Stokes) as lat. 43\r\ndegs.,--but on the western coast, as Dr. Hooker tells me, it extends to\r\nthe R. San Francisco in California, and perhaps even to Kamtschatka. We\r\nthus have an immense range in latitude; and as Cook, who must have been\r\nwell acquainted with the species, found it at Kerguelen Land, no less\r\nthan 140 degs. in longitude.\r\n\r\n[7] Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle, vol. i. p. 363.--It appears\r\nthat sea-weed grows extremely quick.--Mr. Stephenson found (Wilson's\r\nVoyage round Scotland, vol. ii. p. 228) that a rock uncovered only at\r\nspring-tides, which had been chiselled smooth in November, on the\r\nfollowing May, that is, within six months afterwards, was thickly\r\ncovered with Fucus digitatus two feet, and F. esculentus six feet, in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[8] With regard to Tierra del Fuego, the results are deduced from the\r\nobservations of Capt.

The author does not appear aware of\r\na case published by me (Geographical Journal, vol. ix. p. 528) of a\r\ngigantic boulder embedded in an iceberg in the Antarctic Ocean, almost\r\ncertainly one hundred miles distant from any land, and perhaps much\r\nmore distant.  In the Appendix I have discussed at length the\r\nprobability (at that time hardly thought of) of icebergs, when\r\nstranded, grooving and polishing rocks, like glaciers.  This is now a\r\nvery commonly received opinion; and I cannot still avoid the suspicion\r\nthat it is applicable even to such cases as that of the Jura.  Dr.\r\nRichardson has assured me that the icebergs off North America push\r\nbefore them pebbles and sand, and leave the submarine rocky flats quite\r\nbare; it is hardly possible to doubt that such ledges must be polished\r\nand scored in the direction of the set of the prevailing currents.\r\nSince writing that Appendix, I have seen in North Wales (London Phil.\r\nMag., vol. xxi. p. 180) the adjoining action of glaciers and floating\r\nicebergs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCENTRAL CHILE\r\n\r\nValparaiso--Excursion to the Foot of the Andes--Structure of the\r\nLand--Ascend the Bell of Quillota--Shattered Masses of\r\nGreenstone--Immense Valleys--Mines--State of\r\nMiners--Santiago--Hot-baths of\r\nCauquenes--Gold-mines--Grinding-mills--Perforated Stones--Habits of the\r\nPuma--El Turco and Tapacolo--Humming-birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY 23rd.--The Beagle anchored late at night in the bay of Valparaiso,\r\nthe chief seaport of Chile.  When morning came, everything appeared\r\ndelightful.  After Tierra del Fuego, the climate felt quite\r\ndelicious--the atmosphere so dry, and the heavens so clear and blue\r\nwith the sun shining brightly, that all nature seemed sparkling with\r\nlife.  The view from the anchorage is very pretty.  The town is built\r\nat the very foot of a range of hills, about 1600 feet high, and rather\r\nsteep.  From its position, it consists of one long, straggling street,\r\nwhich runs parallel to the beach, and wherever a ravine comes down, the\r\nhouses are piled up on each side of it.  The rounded hills, being only\r\npartially protected by a very scanty vegetation, are worn into\r\nnumberless little gullies, which expose a singularly bright red soil.\r\nFrom this cause, and from the low whitewashed houses with tile roofs,\r\nthe view reminded me of St. Cruz in Teneriffe.  In a north-westerly\r\ndirection there are some fine glimpses of the Andes: but these\r\nmountains appear much grander when viewed from the neighbouring hills:\r\nthe great distance at which they are situated can then more readily be\r\nperceived.  The volcano of Aconcagua is particularly magnificent.  This\r\nhuge and irregularly conical mass has an elevation greater than that of\r\nChimborazo; for, from measurements made by the officers in the Beagle,\r\nits height is no less than 23,000 feet.  The Cordillera, however,\r\nviewed from this point, owe the greater part of their beauty to the\r\natmosphere through which they are seen.  When the sun was setting in\r\nthe Pacific, it was admirable to watch how clearly their rugged\r\noutlines could be distinguished, yet how varied and how delicate were\r\nthe shades of their colour.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to find living here Mr. Richard Corfield, an old\r\nschoolfellow and friend, to whose hospitality and kindness I was\r\ngreatly indebted, in having afforded me a most pleasant residence\r\nduring the Beagle's stay in Chile. The immediate neighbourhood of\r\nValparaiso is not very productive to the naturalist.  During the long\r\nsummer the wind blows steadily from the southward, and a little off\r\nshore, so that rain never falls; during the three winter months,\r\nhowever, it is sufficiently abundant.  The vegetation in consequence is\r\nvery scanty: except in some deep valleys, there are no trees, and only\r\na little grass and a few low bushes are scattered over the less steep\r\nparts of the hills.  When we reflect, that at the distance of 350 miles\r\nto the south, this side of the Andes is completely hidden by one\r\nimpenetrable forest, the contrast is very remarkable.  I took several\r\nlong walks while collecting objects of natural history.  The country is\r\npleasant for exercise.  There are many very beautiful flowers; and, as\r\nin most other dry climates, the plants and shrubs possess strong and\r\npeculiar odours--even one's clothes by brushing through them became\r\nscented.  I did not cease from wonder at finding each succeeding day as\r\nfine as the foregoing. What a difference does climate make in the\r\nenjoyment of life!  How opposite are the sensations when viewing black\r\nmountains half enveloped in clouds, and seeing another range through\r\nthe light blue haze of a fine day!  The one for a time may be very\r\nsublime; the other is all gaiety and happy life.\r\n\r\nAugust 14th.--I  set out on a riding excursion, for the purpose of\r\ngeologizing the basal parts of the Andes, which alone at this time of\r\nthe year are not shut up by the winter snow.  Our first day's ride was\r\nnorthward along the sea-coast. After dark we reached the Hacienda of\r\nQuintero, the estate which formerly belonged to Lord Cochrane.  My\r\nobject in coming here was to see the great beds of shells, which stand\r\nsome yards above the level of the sea, and are burnt for lime.  The\r\nproofs of the elevation of this whole line of coast are unequivocal: at\r\nthe height of a few hundred feet old-looking shells are numerous, and I\r\nfound some at 1300 feet.  These shells either lie loose on the surface,\r\nor are embedded in a reddish-black vegetable mould.  I was much\r\nsurprised to find under the microscope that this vegetable mould is\r\nreally marine mud, full of minute particles of organic bodies.\r\n\r\n15th.--We returned towards the valley of Quillota.  The country was\r\nexceedingly pleasant; just such as poets would call pastoral: green\r\nopen lawns, separated by small valleys with rivulets, and the cottages,\r\nwe may suppose of the shepherds scattered on the hill-sides.  We were\r\nobliged to cross the ridge of the Chilicauquen.  At its base there were\r\nmany fine evergreen forest-trees, but these flourished only in the\r\nravines, where there was running water.  Any person who had seen only\r\nthe country near Valparaiso, would never have imagined that there had\r\nbeen such picturesque spots in Chile. As soon as we reached the brow of\r\nthe Sierra, the valley of Quillota was immediately under our feet.  The\r\nprospect was one of remarkable artificial luxuriance.  The valley is\r\nvery broad and quite flat, and is thus easily irrigated in all parts.\r\nThe little square gardens are crowded with orange and olive trees, and\r\nevery sort of vegetable.  On each side huge bare mountains rise, and\r\nthis from the contrast renders the patchwork valley the more pleasing.\r\nWhoever called \"Valparaiso\" the \"Valley of Paradise,\" must have been\r\nthinking of Quillota.  We crossed over to the Hacienda de San Isidro,\r\nsituated at the very foot of the Bell Mountain.\r\n\r\nChile, as may be seen in the maps, is a narrow strip of land between\r\nthe Cordillera and the Pacific; and this strip is itself traversed by\r\nseveral mountain-lines, which in this part run parallel to the great\r\nrange.  Between these outer lines and the main Cordillera, a succession\r\nof level basins, generally opening into each other by narrow passages,\r\nextend far to the southward: in these, the principal towns are\r\nsituated, as San Felipe, Santiago, San Fernando.  These basins or\r\nplains, together with the transverse flat valleys (like that of\r\nQuillota) which connect them with the coast, I have no doubt are the\r\nbottoms of ancient inlets and deep bays, such as at the present day\r\nintersect every part of Tierra del Fuego and the western coast.  Chile\r\nmust formerly have resembled the latter country in the configuration of\r\nits land and water. The resemblance was occasionally shown strikingly\r\nwhen a level fog-bank covered, as with a mantle, all the lower parts of\r\nthe country: the white vapour curling into the ravines, beautifully\r\nrepresented little coves and bays; and here and there a solitary\r\nhillock peeping up, showed that it had formerly stood there as an\r\nislet.  The contrast of these flat valleys and basins with the\r\nirregular mountains, gave the scenery a character which to me was new\r\nand very interesting.\r\n\r\nFrom the natural slope to seaward of these plains, they are very easily\r\nirrigated, and in consequence singularly fertile.  Without this process\r\nthe land would produce scarcely anything, for during the whole summer\r\nthe sky is cloudless. The mountains and hills are dotted over with\r\nbushes and low trees, and excepting these the vegetation is very\r\nscanty. Each landowner in the valley possesses a certain portion of\r\nhill-country, where his half-wild cattle, in considerable numbers,\r\nmanage to find sufficient pasture.  Once every year there is a grand\r\n\"rodeo,\" when all the cattle are driven down, counted, and marked, and\r\na certain number separated to be fattened in the irrigated fields.\r\nWheat is extensively cultivated, and a good deal of Indian corn: a kind\r\nof bean is, however, the staple article of food for the common\r\nlabourers. The orchards produce an overflowing abundance of peaches\r\nfigs, and grapes.  With all these advantages, the inhabitants of the\r\ncountry ought to be much more prosperous than they are.\r\n\r\n16th.--The mayor-domo of the Hacienda was good enough to give me a\r\nguide and fresh horses; and in the morning we set out to ascend the\r\nCampana, or Bell Mountain, which is 6400 feet high.  The paths were\r\nvery bad, but both the geology and scenery amply repaid the trouble. We\r\nreached by the evening, a spring called the Agua del Guanaco, which is\r\nsituated at a great height.  This must be an old name, for it is very\r\nmany years since a guanaco drank its waters. During the ascent I\r\nnoticed that nothing but bushes grew on the northern slope, whilst on\r\nthe southern slope there was a bamboo about fifteen feet high.  In a\r\nfew places there were palms, and I was surprised to see one at an\r\nelevation of at least 4500 feet.  These palms are, for their family,\r\nugly trees. Their stem is very large, and of a curious form, being\r\nthicker in the middle than at the base or top.  They are excessively\r\nnumerous in some parts of Chile, and valuable on account of a sort of\r\ntreacle made from the sap.  On one estate near Petorca they tried to\r\ncount them, but failed, after having numbered several hundred thousand.\r\nEvery year in the early spring, in August, very many are cut down, and\r\nwhen the trunk is lying on the ground, the crown of leaves is lopped\r\noff.  The sap then immediately begins to flow from the upper end, and\r\ncontinues so doing for some months: it is, however, necessary that a\r\nthin slice should be shaved off from that end every morning, so as to\r\nexpose a fresh surface.  A good tree will give ninety gallons, and all\r\nthis must have been contained in the vessels of the apparently dry\r\ntrunk. It is said that the sap flows much more quickly on those days\r\nwhen the sun is powerful; and likewise, that it is absolutely necessary\r\nto take care, in cutting down the tree, that it should fall with its\r\nhead upwards on the side of the hill; for if it falls down the slope,\r\nscarcely any sap will flow; although in that case one would have\r\nthought that the action would have been aided, instead of checked, by\r\nthe force of gravity.  The sap is concentrated by boiling, and is then\r\ncalled treacle, which it very much resembles in taste.\r\n\r\nWe unsaddled our horses near the spring, and prepared to pass the\r\nnight.  The evening was fine, and the atmosphere so clear, that the\r\nmasts of the vessels at anchor in the bay of Valparaiso, although no\r\nless than twenty-six geographical miles distant, could be distinguished\r\nclearly as little black streaks.  A ship doubling the point under sail,\r\nappeared as a bright white speck.  Anson expresses much surprise, in\r\nhis voyage, at the distance at which his vessels were discovered from\r\nthe coast; but he did not sufficiently allow for the height of the\r\nland, and the great transparency of the air.\r\n\r\nThe setting of the sun was glorious; the valleys being black whilst the\r\nsnowy peaks of the Andes yet retained a ruby tint.  When it was dark,\r\nwe made a fire beneath a little arbour of bamboos, fried our charqui\r\n(or dried slips of beef), took our mate, and were quite comfortable.\r\nThere is an inexpressible charm in thus living in the open air.  The\r\nevening was calm and still;--the shrill noise of the mountain bizcacha,\r\nand the faint cry of a goatsucker, were occasionally to be heard.\r\nBesides these, few birds, or even insects, frequent these dry, parched\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nAugust 17th.--In the morning we climbed up the rough mass of greenstone\r\nwhich crowns the summit.  This rock, as frequently happens, was much\r\nshattered and broken into huge angular fragments.  I observed, however,\r\none remarkable circumstance, namely, that many of the surfaces\r\npresented every degree of freshness some appearing as if broken the day\r\nbefore, whilst on others lichens had either just become, or had long\r\ngrown, attached.  I so fully believed that this was owing to the\r\nfrequent earthquakes, that I felt inclined to hurry from below each\r\nloose pile.  As one might very easily be deceived in a fact of this\r\nkind, I doubted its accuracy, until ascending Mount Wellington, in Van\r\nDiemen's Land, where earthquakes do not occur; and there I saw the\r\nsummit of the mountain similarly composed and similarly shattered, but\r\nall the blocks appeared as if they had been hurled into their present\r\nposition thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nWe spent the day on the summit, and I never enjoyed one more\r\nthoroughly.  Chile, bounded by the Andes and the Pacific, was seen as\r\nin a map.  The pleasure from the scenery, in itself beautiful, was\r\nheightened by the many reflections which arose from the mere view of\r\nthe Campana range with its lesser parallel ones, and of the broad\r\nvalley of Quillota directly intersecting them.  Who can avoid wondering\r\nat the force which has upheaved these mountains, and even more so at\r\nthe countless ages which it must have required to have broken through,\r\nremoved, and levelled whole masses of them? It is well in this case to\r\ncall to mind the vast shingle and sedimentary beds of Patagonia, which,\r\nif heaped on the Cordillera, would increase its height by so many\r\nthousand feet. When in that country, I wondered how any mountain-chain\r\ncould have supplied such masses, and not have been utterly obliterated.\r\nWe must not now reverse the wonder, and doubt whether all-powerful time\r\ncan grind down mountains--even the gigantic Cordillera--into-gravel and\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Andes was different from that which I had\r\nexpected.  The lower line of the snow was of course horizontal, and to\r\nthis line the even summits of the range seemed quite parallel.  Only at\r\nlong intervals, a group of points or a single cone showed where a\r\nvolcano had existed, or does now exist.  Hence the range resembled a\r\ngreat solid wall, surmounted here and there by a tower, and making a\r\nmost perfect barrier to the country.\r\n\r\nAlmost every part of the hill had been drilled by attempts to open\r\ngold-mines: the rage for mining has left scarcely a spot in Chile\r\nunexamined.  I spent the evening as before, talking round the fire with\r\nmy two companions.  The Guasos of Chile, who correspond to the Gauchos\r\nof the Pampas, are, however, a very different set of beings.  Chile is\r\nthe more civilized of the two countries, and the inhabitants, in\r\nconsequence, have lost much individual character.  Gradations in rank\r\nare much more strongly marked: the Guaso does not by any means consider\r\nevery man his equal; and I was quite surprised to find that my\r\ncompanions did not like to eat at the same time with myself.  This\r\nfeeling of inequality is a necessary consequence of the existence of an\r\naristocracy of wealth.  It is said that some few of the greater\r\nlandowners possess from five to ten thousand pounds sterling per annum:\r\nan inequality of riches which I believe is not met with in any of the\r\ncattle-breeding countries eastward of the Andes. A traveller does not\r\nhere meet that unbounded hospitality which refuses all payment, but yet\r\nis so kindly offered that no scruples can be raised in accepting it.\r\nAlmost every house in Chile will receive you for the night, but a\r\ntrifle is expected to be given in the morning; even a rich man will\r\naccept two or three shillings.  The Gaucho, although he may be a\r\ncutthroat, is a gentleman; the Guaso is in few respects better, but at\r\nthe same time a vulgar, ordinary fellow.  The two men, although\r\nemployed much in the same manner, are different in their habits and\r\nattire; and the peculiarities of each are universal in their respective\r\ncountries.  The Gaucho seems part of his horse, and scorns to exert\r\nhimself except when on his back: the Guaso may be hired to work as a\r\nlabourer in the fields.  The former lives entirely on animal food; the\r\nlatter almost wholly on vegetable.  We do not here see the white boots,\r\nthe broad drawers and scarlet chilipa; the picturesque costume of the\r\nPampas.  Here, common trousers are protected by black and green worsted\r\nleggings.  The poncho, however, is common to both.  The chief pride of\r\nthe Guaso lies in his spurs, which are absurdly large.  I measured one\r\nwhich was six inches in the _diameter_  of the rowel, and the rowel\r\nitself contained upwards of thirty points.  The stirrups are on the\r\nsame scale, each consisting of a square, carved block of wood, hollowed\r\nout, yet weighing three or four pounds.  The Guaso is perhaps more\r\nexpert with the lazo than the Gaucho; but, from the nature of the\r\ncountry, he does not know the use of the bolas.\r\n\r\nAugust 18th.--We descended the mountain, and passed some beautiful\r\nlittle spots, with rivulets and fine trees. Having slept at the same\r\nhacienda as before, we rode during the two succeeding days up the\r\nvalley, and passed through Quillota, which is more like a collection of\r\nnursery-gardens than a town.  The orchards were beautiful, presenting\r\none mass of peach-blossoms.  I saw, also, in one or two places the\r\ndate-palm; it is a most stately tree; and I should think a group of\r\nthem in their native Asiatic or African deserts must be superb.  We\r\npassed likewise San Felipe, a pretty straggling town like Quillota. The\r\nvalley in this part expands into one of those great bays or plains,\r\nreaching to the foot of the Cordillera, which have been mentioned as\r\nforming so curious a part of the scenery of Chile.  In the evening we\r\nreached the mines of Jajuel, situated in a ravine at the flank of the\r\ngreat chain.  I stayed here five days.  My host the superintendent of\r\nthe mine, was a shrewd but rather ignorant Cornish miner.  He had\r\nmarried a Spanish woman, and did not mean to return home; but his\r\nadmiration for the mines of Cornwall remained unbounded.  Amongst many\r\nother questions, he asked me, \"Now that George Rex is dead, how many\r\nmore of the family of Rexes are yet alive?\" This Rex certainly must be\r\na relation of the great author Finis, who wrote all books!\r\n\r\nThese mines are of copper, and the ore is all shipped to Swansea, to be\r\nsmelted.  Hence the mines have an aspect singularly quiet, as compared\r\nto those in England: here no smoke, furnaces, or great steam-engines,\r\ndisturb the solitude of the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\nThe Chilian government, or rather the old Spanish law, encourages by\r\nevery method the searching for mines.  The discoverer may work a mine\r\non any ground, by paying five shillings; and before paying this he may\r\ntry, even in the garden of another man, for twenty days.\r\n\r\nIt is now well known that the Chilian method of mining is the cheapest.\r\nMy host says that the two principal improvements introduced by\r\nforeigners have been, first, reducing by previous roasting the copper\r\npyrites--which, being the common ore in Cornwall, the English miners\r\nwere astounded on their arrival to find thrown away as useless:\r\nsecondly, stamping and washing the scoriae from the old furnaces--by\r\nwhich process particles of metal are recovered in abundance.  I have\r\nactually seen mules carrying to the coast, for transportation to\r\nEngland, a cargo of such cinders. But the first case is much the most\r\ncurious.  The Chilian miners were so convinced that copper pyrites\r\ncontained not a particle of copper, that they laughed at the Englishmen\r\nfor their ignorance, who laughed in turn, and bought their richest\r\nveins for a few dollars.  It is very odd that, in a country where\r\nmining had been extensively carried on for many years, so simple a\r\nprocess as gently roasting the ore to expel the sulphur previous to\r\nsmelting it, had never been discovered. A few improvements have\r\nlikewise been introduced in some of the simple machinery; but even to\r\nthe present day, water is removed from some mines by men carrying it up\r\nthe shaft in leathern bags!\r\n\r\nThe labouring men work very hard.  They have little time allowed for\r\ntheir meals, and during summer and winter they begin when it is light,\r\nand leave off at dark.  They are paid one pound sterling a month, and\r\ntheir food is given them: this for breakfast consists of sixteen figs\r\nand two small loaves of bread; for dinner, boiled beans; for supper,\r\nbroken roasted wheat grain.  They scarcely ever taste meat; as, with\r\nthe twelve pounds per annum, they have to clothe themselves, and\r\nsupport their families.  The miners who work in the mine itself have\r\ntwenty-five shillings per month, and are allowed a little charqui.  But\r\nthese men come down from their bleak habitations only once in every\r\nfortnight or three weeks.\r\n\r\nDuring my stay here I thoroughly enjoyed scrambling about these huge\r\nmountains.  The geology, as might have been expected, was very\r\ninteresting.  The shattered and baked rocks, traversed by innumerable\r\ndykes of greenstone, showed what commotions had formerly taken place.\r\nThe scenery was much the same as that near the Bell of Quillota--dry\r\nbarren mountains, dotted at intervals by bushes with a scanty foliage.\r\nThe cactuses, or rather opuntias were here very numerous.  I measured\r\none of a spherical figure, which, including the spines, was six feet\r\nand four inches in circumference.  The height of the common\r\ncylindrical, branching kind, is from twelve to fifteen feet, and the\r\ngirth (with spines) of the branches between three and four feet.\r\n\r\nA heavy fall of snow on the mountains prevented me during the last two\r\ndays, from making some interesting excursions.  I attempted to reach a\r\nlake which the inhabitants, from some unaccountable reason, believe to\r\nbe an arm of the sea.  During a very dry season, it was proposed to\r\nattempt cutting a channel from it for the sake of the water, but the\r\npadre, after a consultation, declared it was too dangerous, as all\r\nChile would be inundated, if, as generally supposed, the lake was\r\nconnected with the Pacific.  We ascended to a great height, but\r\nbecoming involved in the snow-drifts failed in reaching this wonderful\r\nlake, and had some difficulty in returning.  I thought we should have\r\nlost our horses; for there was no means of guessing how deep the drifts\r\nwere, and the animals, when led, could only move by jumping.  The black\r\nsky showed that a fresh snow-storm was gathering, and we therefore were\r\nnot a little glad when we escaped.  By the time we reached the base the\r\nstorm commenced, and it was lucky for us that this did not happen three\r\nhours earlier in the day.\r\n\r\nAugust 26th.--We left Jajuel and again crossed the basin of San Felipe.\r\nThe day was truly Chilian: glaringly bright, and the atmosphere quite\r\nclear.  The thick and uniform covering of newly fallen snow rendered\r\nthe view of the volcano of Aconcagua and the main chain quite glorious.\r\nWe were now on the road to Santiago, the capital of Chile.  We crossed\r\nthe Cerro del Talguen, and slept at a little rancho. The host, talking\r\nabout the state of Chile as compared to other countries, was very\r\nhumble: \"Some see with two eyes, and some with one, but for my part I\r\ndo not think that Chile sees with any.\"\r\n\r\nAugust 27th.--After crossing many low hills we descended into the small\r\nland-locked plain of Guitron.  In the basins, such as this one, which\r\nare elevated from one thousand to two thousand feet above the sea, two\r\nspecies of acacia, which are stunted in their forms, and stand wide\r\napart from each other, grow in large numbers.  These trees are never\r\nfound near the sea-coast; and this gives another characteristic feature\r\nto the scenery of these basins.  We crossed a low ridge which separates\r\nGuitron from the great plain on which Santiago stands.  The view was\r\nhere pre-eminently striking: the dead level surface, covered in parts\r\nby woods of acacia, and with the city in the distance, abutting\r\nhorizontally against the base of the Andes, whose snowy peaks were\r\nbright with the evening sun.  At the first glance of this view, it was\r\nquite evident that the plain represented the extent of a former inland\r\nsea.  As soon as we gained the level road we pushed our horses into a\r\ngallop, and reached the city before it was dark.\r\n\r\nI stayed a week in Santiago, and enjoyed myself very much.  In the\r\nmorning I rode to various places on the plain, and in the evening dined\r\nwith several of the English merchants, whose hospitality at this place\r\nis well known.  A never-failing source of pleasure was to ascend the\r\nlittle hillock of rock (St. Lucia) which projects in the middle of the\r\ncity.  The scenery certainly is most striking, and, as I have said,\r\nvery peculiar.  I am informed that this same character is common to the\r\ncities on the great Mexican platform.  Of the town I have nothing to\r\nsay in detail: it is not so fine or so large as Buenos Ayres, but is\r\nbuilt after the same model.  I arrived here by a circuit to the north;\r\nso I resolved to return to Valparaiso by a rather longer excursion to\r\nthe south of the direct road.\r\n\r\nSeptember 5th.--By the middle of the day we arrived at one of the\r\nsuspension bridges, made of hide, which cross the Maypu, a large\r\nturbulent river a few leagues southward of Santiago.  These bridges are\r\nvery poor affairs.  The road, following the curvature of the suspending\r\nropes, is made of bundles of sticks placed close together.  It was full\r\nof holes, and oscillated rather fearfully, even with the weight of a\r\nman leading his horse.  In the evening we reached a comfortable\r\nfarm-house, where there were several very pretty senoritas.  They were\r\nmuch horrified at my having entered one of their churches out of mere\r\ncuriosity.  They asked me, \"Why do you not become a Christian--for our\r\nreligion is certain?\" I assured them I was a sort of Christian; but\r\nthey would not hear of it--appealing to my own words, \"Do not your\r\npadres, your very bishops, marry?\" The absurdity of a bishop having a\r\nwife particularly struck them: they scarcely knew whether to be most\r\namused or horror-struck at such an enormity.\r\n\r\n6th.--We proceeded due south, and slept at Rancagua. The road passed\r\nover the level but narrow plain, bounded on one side by lofty hills,\r\nand on the other by the Cordillera. The next day we turned up the\r\nvalley of the Rio Cachapual, in which the hot-baths of Cauquenes, long\r\ncelebrated for their medicinal properties, are situated.  The\r\nsuspension bridges, in the less frequented parts, are generally taken\r\ndown during the winter when the rivers are low.  Such was the case in\r\nthis valley, and we were therefore obliged to cross the stream on\r\nhorseback.  This is rather disagreeable, for the foaming water, though\r\nnot deep, rushes so quickly over the bed of large rounded stones, that\r\none's head becomes quite confused, and it is difficult even to perceive\r\nwhether the horse is moving onward or standing still.  In summer, when\r\nthe snow melts, the torrents are quite impassable; their strength and\r\nfury are then extremely great, as might be plainly seen by the marks\r\nwhich they had left.  We reached the baths in the evening, and stayed\r\nthere five days, being confined the two last by heavy rain.  The\r\nbuildings consist of a square of miserable little hovels, each with a\r\nsingle table and bench.  They are situated in a narrow deep valley just\r\nwithout the central Cordillera.  It is a quiet, solitary spot, with a\r\ngood deal of wild beauty.\r\n\r\nThe mineral springs of Cauquenes burst forth on a line of dislocation,\r\ncrossing a mass of stratified rock, the whole of which betrays the\r\naction of heat.  A considerable quantity of gas is continually escaping\r\nfrom the same orifices with the water.  Though the springs are only a\r\nfew yards apart, they have very different temperature; and this appears\r\nto be the result of an unequal mixture of cold water: for those with\r\nthe lowest temperature have scarcely any mineral taste. After the great\r\nearthquake of 1822 the springs ceased, and the water did not return for\r\nnearly a year.  They were also much affected by the earthquake of 1835;\r\nthe temperature being suddenly changed from 118 to 92 degs. [1] It\r\nseems probable that mineral waters rising deep from the bowels of the\r\nearth, would always be more deranged by subterranean disturbances than\r\nthose nearer the surface.  The man who had charge of the baths assured\r\nme that in summer the water is hotter and more plentiful than in\r\nwinter.  The former circumstance I should have expected, from the less\r\nmixture, during the dry season, of cold water; but the latter statement\r\nappears very strange and contradictory.  The periodical increase during\r\nthe summer, when rain never falls, can, I think, only be accounted for\r\nby the melting of the snow: yet the mountains which are covered by snow\r\nduring that season, are three or four leagues distant from the springs.\r\nI have no reason to doubt the accuracy of my informer, who, having\r\nlived on the spot for several years, ought to be well acquainted with\r\nthe circumstance,--which, if true, certainly is very curious: for we\r\nmust suppose that the snow-water, being conducted through porous strata\r\nto the regions of heat, is again thrown up to the surface by the line\r\nof dislocated and injected rocks at Cauquenes; and the regularity of\r\nthe phenomenon would seem to indicate that in this district heated rock\r\noccurred at a depth not very great.\r\n\r\nOne day I rode up the valley to the farthest inhabited spot.  Shortly\r\nabove that point, the Cachapual divides into two deep tremendous\r\nravines, which penetrate directly into the great range.  I scrambled up\r\na peaked mountain, probably more than six thousand feet high.  Here, as\r\nindeed everywhere else, scenes of the highest interest presented\r\nthemselves.  It was by one of these ravines, that Pincheira entered\r\nChile and ravaged the neighbouring country.  This is the same man whose\r\nattack on an estancia at the Rio Negro I have described.  He was a\r\nrenegade half-caste Spaniard, who collected a great body of Indians\r\ntogether and established himself by a stream in the Pampas, which place\r\nnone of the forces sent after him could ever discover.  From this point\r\nhe used to sally forth, and crossing the Cordillera by passes hitherto\r\nunattempted, he ravaged the farm-houses and drove the cattle to his\r\nsecret rendezvous.  Pincheira was a capital horseman, and he made all\r\naround him equally good, for he invariably shot any one who hesitated\r\nto follow him.  It was against this man, and other wandering Indian\r\ntribes, that Rosas waged the war of extermination.\r\n\r\nSeptember 13th.--We left the baths of Cauquenes, and, rejoining the\r\nmain road, slept at the Rio Clara.  From this place we rode to the town\r\nof San Fernando.  Before arriving there, the last land-locked basin had\r\nexpanded into a great plain, which extended so far to the south, that\r\nthe snowy summits of the more distant Andes were seen as if above the\r\nhorizon of the sea.  San Fernando is forty leagues from Santiago; and\r\nit was my farthest point southward; for we here turned at right angles\r\ntowards the coast.  We slept at the gold-mines of Yaquil, which are\r\nworked by Mr. Nixon, an American gentleman, to whose kindness I was\r\nmuch indebted during the four days I stayed at his house.  The next\r\nmorning we rode to the mines, which are situated at the distance of\r\nsome leagues, near the summit of a lofty hill.  On the way we had a\r\nglimpse of the lake Tagua-tagua, celebrated for its floating islands,\r\nwhich have been described by M. Gay. [2] They are composed of the\r\nstalks of various dead plants intertwined together, and on the surface\r\nof which other living ones take root.  Their form is generally\r\ncircular, and their thickness from four to six feet, of which the\r\ngreater part is immersed in the water.  As the wind blows, they pass\r\nfrom one side of the lake to the other, and often carry cattle and\r\nhorses as passengers.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the mine, I was struck by the pale appearance of\r\nmany of the men, and inquired from Mr. Nixon respecting their\r\ncondition.  The mine is 450 feet deep, and each man brings up about 200\r\npounds weight of stone. With this load they have to climb up the\r\nalternate notches cut in the trunks of trees, placed in a zigzag line\r\nup the shaft. Even beardless young men, eighteen and twenty years old,\r\nwith little muscular development of their bodies (they are quite naked\r\nexcepting drawers) ascend with this great load from nearly the same\r\ndepth.  A strong man, who is not accustomed to this labour, perspires\r\nmost profusely, with merely carrying up his own body.  With this very\r\nsevere labour, they live entirely on boiled beans and bread.  They\r\nwould prefer having bread alone; but their masters, finding that they\r\ncannot work so hard upon this, treat them like horses, and make them\r\neat the beans.  Their pay is here rather more than at the mines of\r\nJajuel, being from 24 to 28 shillings per month.  They leave the mine\r\nonly once in three weeks; when they stay with their families for two\r\ndays.  One of the rules of this mine sounds very harsh, but answers\r\npretty well for the master.  The only method of stealing gold is to\r\nsecrete pieces of the ore, and take them out as occasion may offer.\r\nWhenever the major-domo finds a lump thus hidden, its full value is\r\nstopped out of the wages of all the men; who thus, without they all\r\ncombine, are obliged to keep watch over each other.\r\n\r\nWhen the ore is brought to the mill, it is ground into an impalpable\r\npowder; the process of washing removes all the lighter particles, and\r\namalgamation finally secures the gold-dust.  The washing, when\r\ndescribed, sounds a very simple process; but it is beautiful to see how\r\nthe exact adaptation of the current of water to the specific gravity of\r\nthe gold, so easily separates the powdered matrix from the metal.  The\r\nmud which passes from the mills is collected into pools, where it\r\nsubsides, and every now and then is cleared out, and thrown into a\r\ncommon heap.  A great deal of chemical action then commences, salts of\r\nvarious kinds effloresce on the surface, and the mass becomes hard.\r\nAfter having been left for a year or two, and then rewashed, it yields\r\ngold; and this process may be repeated even six or seven times; but the\r\ngold each time becomes less in quantity, and the intervals required (as\r\nthe inhabitants say, to generate the metal) are longer.  There can be\r\nno doubt that the chemical action, already mentioned, each time\r\nliberates fresh gold from some combination.  The discovery of a method\r\nto effect this before the first grinding would without doubt raise the\r\nvalue of gold-ores many fold.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find how the minute particles of gold, being scattered\r\nabout and not corroding, at last accumulate in some quantity.  A short\r\ntime since a few miners, being out of work, obtained permission to\r\nscrape the ground round the house and mills; they washed the earth thus\r\ngot together, and so procured thirty dollars' worth of gold.  This is\r\nan exact counterpart of what takes place in nature.  Mountains suffer\r\ndegradation and wear away, and with them the metallic veins which they\r\ncontain.  The hardest rock is worn into impalpable mud, the ordinary\r\nmetals oxidate, and both are removed; but gold, platina, and a few\r\nothers are nearly indestructible, and from their weight, sinking to the\r\nbottom, are left behind. After whole mountains have passed through this\r\ngrinding mill, and have been washed by the hand of nature, the residue\r\nbecomes metalliferous, and man finds it worth his while to complete the\r\ntask of separation.\r\n\r\nBad as the above treatment of the miners appears, it is gladly accepted\r\nof by them; for the condition of the labouring agriculturists is much\r\nworse.  Their wages are lower, and they live almost exclusively on\r\nbeans.  This poverty must be chiefly owing to the feudal-like system on\r\nwhich the land is tilled: the landowner gives a small plot of ground to\r\nthe labourer for building on and cultivating, and in return has his\r\nservices (or those of a proxy) for every day of his life, without any\r\nwages.  Until a father has a grown-up son, who can by his labour pay\r\nthe rent, there is no one, except on occasional days, to take care of\r\nhis own patch of ground. Hence extreme poverty is very common among the\r\nlabouring classes in this country.\r\n\r\nThere are some old Indian ruins in this neighbourhood, and I was shown\r\none of the perforated stones, which Molina mentions as being found in\r\nmany places in considerable numbers.  They are of a circular flattened\r\nform, from five to six inches in diameter, with a hole passing quite\r\nthrough the centre.  It has generally been supposed that they were used\r\nas heads to clubs, although their form does not appear at all well\r\nadapted for that purpose.  Burchell [3] states that some of the tribes\r\nin Southern Africa dig up roots by the aid of a stick pointed at one\r\nend, the force and weight of which are increased by a round stone with\r\na hole in it, into which the other end is firmly wedged.  It appears\r\nprobable that the Indians of Chile formerly used some such rude\r\nagricultural instrument.\r\n\r\nOne day, a German collector in natural history, of the name of Renous,\r\ncalled, and nearly at the same time an old Spanish lawyer.  I was\r\namused at being told the conversation which took place between them.\r\nRenous speaks Spanish so well, that the old lawyer mistook him for a\r\nChilian.  Renous alluding to me, asked him what he thought of the King\r\nof England sending out a collector to their country, to pick up lizards\r\nand beetles, and to break stones?  The old gentleman thought seriously\r\nfor some time, and then said, \"It is not well,--_hay un gato encerrado\r\naqui_ (there is a cat shut up here).  No man is so rich as to send out\r\npeople to pick up such rubbish.  I do not like it: if one of us were to\r\ngo and do such things in England, do not you think the King of England\r\nwould very soon send us out of his country?\" And this old gentleman,\r\nfrom his profession, belongs to the better informed and more\r\nintelligent classes!  Renous himself, two or three years before, left\r\nin a house at San Fernando some caterpillars, under charge of a girl to\r\nfeed, that they might turn into butterflies.  This was rumoured through\r\nthe town, and at last the padres and governor consulted together, and\r\nagreed it must be some heresy.  Accordingly, when Renous returned, he\r\nwas arrested.\r\n\r\nSeptember 19th.--We left Yaquil, and followed the flat valley, formed\r\nlike that of Quillota, in which the Rio Tinderidica flows.  Even at\r\nthese few miles south of Santiago the climate is much damper; in\r\nconsequence there are fine tracts of pasturage, which are not\r\nirrigated. (20th.) We followed this valley till it expanded into a\r\ngreat plain, which reaches from the sea to the mountains west of\r\nRancagua. We shortly lost all trees and even bushes; so that the\r\ninhabitants are nearly as badly off for firewood as those in the\r\nPampas.  Never having heard of these plains, I was much surprised at\r\nmeeting with such scenery in Chile.  The plains belong to more than one\r\nseries of different elevations, and they are traversed by broad\r\nflat-bottomed valleys; both of which circumstances, as in Patagonia,\r\nbespeak the action of the sea on gently rising land.  In the steep\r\ncliffs bordering these valleys, there are some large caves, which no\r\ndoubt were originally formed by the waves: one of these is celebrated\r\nunder the name of Cueva del Obispo; having formerly been consecrated.\r\nDuring the day I felt very unwell, and from that time till the end of\r\nOctober did not recover.\r\n\r\nSeptember 22nd.--We continued to pass over green plains without a tree.\r\nThe next day we arrived at a house near Navedad, on the sea-coast,\r\nwhere a rich Haciendero gave us lodgings.  I stayed here the two\r\nensuing days, and although very unwell, managed to collect from the\r\ntertiary formation some marine shells.\r\n\r\n24th.--Our course was now directed towards Valparaiso, which with great\r\ndifficulty I reached on the 27th, and was there confined to my bed till\r\nthe end of October.  During this time I was an inmate in Mr. Corfield's\r\nhouse, whose kindness to me I do not know how to express.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will here add a few observations on some of the animals and birds of\r\nChile.  The Puma, or South American Lion, is not uncommon.  This animal\r\nhas a wide geographical range; being found from the equatorial forests,\r\nthroughout the deserts of Patagonia as far south as the damp and cold\r\nlatitudes (53 to 54 degs.) of Tierra del Fuego.  I have seen its\r\nfootsteps in the Cordillera of central Chile, at an elevation of at\r\nleast 10,000 feet.  In La Plata the puma preys chiefly on deer,\r\nostriches, bizcacha, and other small quadrupeds; it there seldom\r\nattacks cattle or horses, and most rarely man.  In Chile, however, it\r\ndestroys many young horses and cattle, owing probably to the scarcity\r\nof other quadrupeds: I heard, likewise, of two men and a woman who had\r\nbeen thus killed. It is asserted that the puma always kills its prey by\r\nspringing on the shoulders, and then drawing back the head with one of\r\nits paws, until the vertebrae break: I have seen in Patagonia the\r\nskeletons of guanacos, with their necks thus dislocated.\r\n\r\nThe puma, after eating its fill, covers the carcass with many large\r\nbushes, and lies down to watch it.  This habit is often the cause of\r\nits being discovered; for the condors wheeling in the air every now and\r\nthen descend to partake of the feast, and being angrily driven away,\r\nrise all together on the wing.  The Chileno Guaso then knows there is a\r\nlion watching his prey--the word is given--and men and dogs hurry to\r\nthe chase.  Sir F. Head says that a Gaucho in the pampas, upon merely\r\nseeing some condors wheeling in the air, cried \"A lion!\" I could never\r\nmyself meet with any one who pretended to such powers of\r\ndiscrimination.  It is asserted that, if a puma has once been betrayed\r\nby thus watching the carcass, and has then been hunted, it never\r\nresumes this habit; but that, having gorged itself, it wanders far\r\naway. The puma is easily killed.  In an open country, it is first\r\nentangled with the bolas, then lazoed, and dragged along the ground\r\ntill rendered insensible.  At Tandeel (south of the plata), I was told\r\nthat within three months one hundred were thus destroyed.  In Chile\r\nthey are generally driven up bushes or trees, and are then either shot,\r\nor baited to death by dogs.  The dogs employed in this chase belong to\r\na particular breed, called Leoneros: they are weak, slight animals,\r\nlike long-legged terriers, but are born with a particular instinct for\r\nthis sport.  The puma is described as being very crafty: when pursued,\r\nit often returns on its former track, and then suddenly making a spring\r\non one side, waits there till the dogs have passed by.  It is a very\r\nsilent animal, uttering no cry even when wounded, and only rarely\r\nduring the breeding season.\r\n\r\nOf birds, two species of the genus Pteroptochos (megapodius and\r\nalbicollis of Kittlitz) are perhaps the most conspicuous. The former,\r\ncalled by the Chilenos \"el Turco,\" is as large as a fieldfare, to which\r\nbird it has some alliance; but its legs are much longer, tail shorter,\r\nand beak stronger: its colour is a reddish brown.  The Turco is not\r\nuncommon. It lives on the ground, sheltered among the thickets which\r\nare scattered over the dry and sterile hills.  With its tail erect, and\r\nstilt-like legs, it may be seen every now and then popping from one\r\nbush to another with uncommon quickness. It really requires little\r\nimagination to believe that the bird is ashamed of itself, and is aware\r\nof its most ridiculous figure.  On first seeing it, one is tempted to\r\nexclaim, \"A vilely stuffed specimen has escaped from some museum, and\r\nhas come to life again!\" It cannot be made to take flight without the\r\ngreatest trouble, nor does it run, but only hops.  The various loud\r\ncries which it utters when concealed amongst the bushes, are as strange\r\nas its appearance.  It is said to build its nest in a deep hole beneath\r\nthe ground.  I dissected several specimens: the gizzard, which was very\r\nmuscular, contained beetles, vegetable fibres, and pebbles.  From this\r\ncharacter, from the length of its legs, scratching feet, membranous\r\ncovering to the nostrils, short and arched wings, this bird seems in a\r\ncertain degree to connect the thrushes with the gallinaceous order.\r\n\r\nThe second species (or P. albicollis) is allied to the first in its\r\ngeneral form.  It is called Tapacolo, or \"cover your posterior;\" and\r\nwell does the shameless little bird deserve its name; for it carries\r\nits tail more than erect, that is, inclined backwards towards its head.\r\nIt is very common, and frequents the bottoms of hedge-rows, and the\r\nbushes scattered over the barren hills, where scarcely another bird can\r\nexist. In its general manner of feeding, of quickly hopping out of the\r\nthickets and back again, in its desire of concealment, unwillingness to\r\ntake flight, and nidification, it bears a close resemblance to the\r\nTurco; but its appearance is not quite so ridiculous.  The Tapacolo is\r\nvery crafty: when frightened by any person, it will remain motionless\r\nat the bottom of a bush, and will then, after a little while, try with\r\nmuch address to crawl away on the opposite side.  It is also an active\r\nbird, and continually making a noise: these noises are various and\r\nstrangely odd; some are like the cooing of doves, others like the\r\nbubbling of water, and many defy all similes.  The country people say\r\nit changes its cry five times in the year--according to some change of\r\nseason, I suppose. [4]\r\n\r\nTwo species of humming-birds are common; Trochilus forficatus is found\r\nover a space of 2500 miles on the west coast, from the hot dry country\r\nof Lima, to the forests of Tierra del Fuego--where it may be seen\r\nflitting about in snow-storms.  In the wooded island of Chiloe, which\r\nhas an extremely humid climate, this little bird, skipping from side to\r\nside amidst the dripping foliage, is perhaps more abundant than almost\r\nany other kind.  I opened the stomachs of several specimens, shot in\r\ndifferent parts of the continent, and in all, remains of insects were\r\nas numerous as in the stomach of a creeper.  When this species migrates\r\nin the summer southward, it is replaced by the arrival of another\r\nspecies coming from the north.  This second kind (Trochilus gigas) is a\r\nvery large bird for the delicate family to which it belongs: when on\r\nthe wing its appearance is singular.  Like others of the genus, it\r\nmoves from place to place with a rapidity which may be compared to that\r\nof Syrphus amongst flies, and Sphinx among moths; but whilst hovering\r\nover a flower, it flaps its wings with a very slow and powerful\r\nmovement, totally different from that vibratory one common to most of\r\nthe species, which produces the humming noise.  I never saw any other\r\nbird where the force of its wings appeared (as in a butterfly) so\r\npowerful in proportion to the weight of its body. When hovering by a\r\nflower, its tail is constantly expanded and shut like a fan, the body\r\nbeing kept in a nearly vertical position.  This action appears to\r\nsteady and support the bird, between the slow movements of its wings.\r\nAlthough flying from flower to flower in search of food, its stomach\r\ngenerally contained abundant remains of insects, which I suspect are\r\nmuch more the object of its search than honey.  The note of this\r\nspecies, like that of nearly the whole family, is extremely shrill.\r\n\r\n[1] Caldeleugh, in Philosoph.

On the 21st we anchored in the bay of S.\r\nCarlos, the capital of Chiloe.\r\n\r\nThis island is about ninety miles long, with a breadth of rather less\r\nthan thirty.  The land is hilly, but not mountainous, and is covered by\r\none great forest, except where a few green patches have been cleared\r\nround the thatched cottages. From a distance the view somewhat\r\nresembles that of Tierra del Fuego; but the woods, when seen nearer,\r\nare incomparably more beautiful.  Many kinds of fine evergreen trees,\r\nand plants with a tropical character, here take the place of the gloomy\r\nbeech of the southern shores.  In winter the climate is detestable, and\r\nin summer it is only a little better.  I should think there are few\r\nparts of the world, within the temperate regions, where so much rain\r\nfalls.  The winds are very boisterous, and the sky almost always\r\nclouded: to have a week of fine weather is something wonderful.  It is\r\neven difficult to get a single glimpse of the Cordillera: during our\r\nfirst visit, once only the volcano of Osorno stood out in bold relief,\r\nand that was before sunrise; it was curious to watch, as the sun rose,\r\nthe outline gradually fading away in the glare of the eastern sky.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, from their complexion and low stature; appear to have\r\nthree-fourths of Indian blood in their veins. They are an humble,\r\nquiet, industrious set of men.  Although the fertile soil, resulting\r\nfrom the decomposition of the volcanic rocks, supports a rank\r\nvegetation, yet the climate is not favourable to any production which\r\nrequires much sunshine to ripen it.  There is very little pasture for\r\nthe larger quadrupeds; and in consequence, the staple articles of food\r\nare pigs, potatoes, and fish.  The people all dress in strong woollen\r\ngarments, which each family makes for itself, and dyes with indigo of a\r\ndark blue colour.  The arts, however, are in the rudest state;--as may\r\nbe seen in their strange fashion of ploughing, their method of\r\nspinning, grinding corn, and in the construction of their boats.  The\r\nforests are so impenetrable, that the land is nowhere cultivated except\r\nnear the coast and on the adjoining islets.  Even where paths exist,\r\nthey are scarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil.\r\nThe inhabitants, like those of Tierra del Fuego, move about chiefly on\r\nthe beach or in boats.  Although with plenty to eat, the people are\r\nvery poor: there is no demand for labour, and consequently the lower\r\norders cannot scrape together money sufficient to purchase even the\r\nsmallest luxuries.  There is also a great deficiency of a circulating\r\nmedium.  I have seen a man bringing on his back a bag of charcoal, with\r\nwhich to buy some trifle, and another carrying a plank to exchange for\r\na bottle of wine.  Hence every tradesman must also be a merchant, and\r\nagain sell the goods which he takes in exchange.\r\n\r\nNovember  24th.--The yawl and whale-boat were sent under the command of\r\nMr. (now Captain) Sulivan, to survey the eastern or inland coast of\r\nChiloe; and with orders to meet the Beagle at the southern extremity of\r\nthe island; to which point she would proceed by the outside, so as thus\r\nto circumnavigate the whole.  I accompanied this expedition, but\r\ninstead of going in the boats the first day, I hired horses to take me\r\nto Chacao, at the northern extremity of the island. The road followed\r\nthe coast; every now and then crossing promontories covered by fine\r\nforests.  In these shaded paths it is absolutely necessary that the\r\nwhole road should be made of logs of wood, which are squared and placed\r\nby the side of each other.  From the rays of the sun never penetrating\r\nthe evergreen foliage, the ground is so damp and soft, that except by\r\nthis means neither man nor horse would be able to pass along.  I\r\narrived at the village of Chacao shortly after the tents belonging to\r\nthe boats were pitched for the night.\r\n\r\nThe land in this neighbourhood has been extensively cleared, and there\r\nwere many quiet and most picturesque nooks in the forest.  Chacao was\r\nformerly the principal port in the island; but many vessels having been\r\nlost, owing to the dangerous currents and rocks in the straits, the\r\nSpanish government burnt the church, and thus arbitrarily compelled the\r\ngreater number of inhabitants to migrate to S. Carlos.  We had not long\r\nbivouacked, before the barefooted son of the governor came down to\r\nreconnoitre us.  Seeing the English flag hoisted at the yawl's\r\nmast-head, he asked with the utmost indifference, whether it was always\r\nto fly at Chacao.  In several places the inhabitants were much\r\nastonished at the appearance of men-of-war's boats, and hoped and\r\nbelieved it was the forerunner of a Spanish fleet, coming to recover\r\nthe island from the patriot government of Chile.  All the men in power,\r\nhowever, had been informed of our intended visit, and were exceedingly\r\ncivil.  While we were eating our supper, the governor paid us a visit.\r\nHe had been a lieutenant-colonel in the Spanish service, but now was\r\nmiserably poor.  He gave us two sheep, and accepted in return two\r\ncotton handkerchiefs, some brass trinkets, and a little tobacco.\r\n\r\n25th.--Torrents of rain: we managed, however, to run down the coast as\r\nfar as Huapi-lenou.  The whole of this eastern side of Chiloe has one\r\naspect; it is a plain, broken by valleys and divided into little\r\nislands, and the whole thickly covered with one impervious\r\nblackish-green forest.  On the margins there are some cleared spaces,\r\nsurrounding the high-roofed cottages.\r\n\r\n26th--The day rose splendidly clear.  The volcano of Orsono was\r\nspouting out volumes of smoke.  This most beautiful mountain, formed\r\nlike a perfect cone, and white with snow, stands out in front of the\r\nCordillera.  Another great volcano, with a saddle-shaped summit, also\r\nemitted from its immense crater little jets of steam.  Subsequently we\r\nsaw the lofty-peaked Corcovado--well deserving the name of \"el famoso\r\nCorcovado.\" Thus we beheld, from one point of view, three great active\r\nvolcanoes, each about seven thousand feet high.  In addition to this,\r\nfar to the south, there were other lofty cones covered with snow,\r\nwhich, although not known to be active, must be in their origin\r\nvolcanic. The line of the Andes is not, in this neighbourhood, nearly\r\nso elevated as in Chile; neither does it appear to form so perfect a\r\nbarrier between the regions of the earth.  This great range, although\r\nrunning in a straight north and south line, owing to an optical\r\ndeception, always appeared more or less curved; for the lines drawn\r\nfrom each peak to the beholder's eye, necessarily converged like the\r\nradii of a semicircle, and as it was not possible (owing to the\r\nclearness of the atmosphere and the absence of all intermediate\r\nobjects) to judge how far distant the farthest peaks were off, they\r\nappeared to stand in a flattish semicircle.\r\n\r\nLanding at midday, we saw a family of pure Indian extraction. The\r\nfather was singularly like York Minster; and some of the younger boys,\r\nwith their ruddy complexions, might have been mistaken for Pampas\r\nIndians.  Everything I have seen, convinces me of the close connexion\r\nof the different American tribes, who nevertheless speak distinct\r\nlanguages. This party could muster but little Spanish, and talked to\r\neach other in their own tongue.  It is a pleasant thing to see the\r\naborigines advanced to the same degree of civilization, however low\r\nthat may be, which their white conquerors have attained.  More to the\r\nsouth we saw many pure Indians: indeed, all the inhabitants of some of\r\nthe islets retain their Indian surnames.  In the census of 1832, there\r\nwere in Chiloe and its dependencies forty-two thousand souls; the\r\ngreater number of these appear to be of mixed blood.  Eleven thousand\r\nretain their Indian surnames, but it is probable that not nearly all of\r\nthese are of a pure breed.  Their manner of life is the same with that\r\nof the other poor inhabitants, and they are all Christians; but it is\r\nsaid that they yet retain some strange superstitious ceremonies, and\r\nthat they pretend to hold communication with the devil in certain\r\ncaves.  Formerly, every one convicted of this offence was sent to the\r\nInquisition at Lima.  Many of the inhabitants who are not included in\r\nthe eleven thousand with Indian surnames, cannot be distinguished by\r\ntheir appearance from Indians. Gomez, the governor of Lemuy, is\r\ndescended from noblemen of Spain on both sides; but by constant\r\nintermarriages with the natives the present man is an Indian.  On the\r\nother hand the governor of Quinchao boasts much of his purely kept\r\nSpanish blood.\r\n\r\nWe reached at night a beautiful little cove, north of the island of\r\nCaucahue.  The people here complained of want of land.  This is partly\r\nowing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods, and partly to\r\nrestrictions by the government, which makes it necessary, before buying\r\never so small a piece, to pay two shillings to the surveyor for\r\nmeasuring each quadra (150 yards square), together with whatever price\r\nhe fixes for the value of the land.  After his valuation the land must\r\nbe put up three times to auction, and if no one bids more, the\r\npurchaser can have it at that rate.  All these exactions must be a\r\nserious check to clearing the ground, where the inhabitants are so\r\nextremely poor.  In most countries, forests are removed without much\r\ndifficulty by the aid of fire; but in Chiloe, from the damp nature of\r\nthe climate, and the sort of trees, it is necessary first to cut them\r\ndown. This is a heavy drawback to the prosperity of Chiloe.  In the\r\ntime of the Spaniards the Indians could not hold land; and a family,\r\nafter having cleared a piece of ground, might be driven away, and the\r\nproperty seized by the government. The Chilian authorities are now\r\nperforming an act of justice by making retribution to these poor\r\nIndians, giving to each man, according to his grade of life, a certain\r\nportion of land. The value of uncleared ground is very little.  The\r\ngovernment gave Mr. Douglas (the present surveyor, who informed me of\r\nthese circumstances) eight and a half square miles of forest near S.\r\nCarlos, in lieu of a debt; and this he sold for 350 dollars, or about\r\n70 pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nThe two succeeding days were fine, and at night we reached the island\r\nof Quinchao.  This neighbourhood is the most cultivated part of the\r\nArchipelago; for a broad strip of land on the coast of the main island,\r\nas well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones, is almost completely\r\ncleared.  Some of the farm-houses seemed very comfortable.  I was\r\ncurious to ascertain how rich any of these people might be, but Mr.\r\nDouglas says that no one can be considered as possessing a regular\r\nincome.  One of the richest landowners might possibly accumulate, in a\r\nlong industrious life, as much as 1000 pounds sterling; but should this\r\nhappen, it would all be stowed away in some secret corner, for it is\r\nthe custom of almost every family to have a jar or treasure-chest\r\nburied in the ground.\r\n\r\nNovember 30th.--Early on Sunday morning we reached Castro, the ancient\r\ncapital of Chiloe, but now a most forlorn and deserted place. The usual\r\nquadrangular arrangement of Spanish towns could be traced, but the\r\nstreets and plaza were coated with fine green turf, on which sheep were\r\nbrowsing.  The church, which stands in the middle, is entirely built of\r\nplank, and has a picturesque and venerable appearance. The poverty of\r\nthe place may be conceived from the fact, that although containing some\r\nhundreds of inhabitants, one of our party was unable anywhere to\r\npurchase either a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife.  No individual\r\npossessed either a watch or a clock; and an old man, who was supposed\r\nto have a good idea of time, was employed to strike the church bell by\r\nguess.  The arrival of our boats was a rare event in this quiet retired\r\ncorner of the world; and nearly all the inhabitants came down to the\r\nbeach to see us pitch our tents.  They were very civil, and offered us\r\na house; and one man even sent us a cask of cider as a present.  In the\r\nafternoon we paid our respects to the governor--a quiet old man, who,\r\nin his appearance and manner of life, was scarcely superior to an\r\nEnglish cottager.  At night heavy rain set in, which was hardly\r\nsufficient to drive away from our tents the large circle of lookers-on.\r\nAn Indian family, who had come to trade in a canoe from Caylen,\r\nbivouacked near us.  They had no shelter during the rain.  In the\r\nmorning I asked a young Indian, who was wet to the skin, how he had\r\npassed the night.  He seemed perfectly content, and answered, \"Muy\r\nbien, senor.\"\r\n\r\nDecember 1st.--We steered for the island of Lemuy.  I was anxious to\r\nexamine a reported coal-mine which turned out to be lignite of little\r\nvalue, in the sandstone (probably of an ancient tertiary epoch) of\r\nwhich these islands are composed.  When we reached Lemuy we had much\r\ndifficulty in finding any place to pitch our tents, for it was\r\nspring-tide, and the land was wooded down to the water's edge.  In a\r\nshort time we were surrounded by a large group of the nearly pure\r\nIndian inhabitants.  They were much surprised at our arrival, and said\r\none to the other, \"This is the reason we have seen so many parrots\r\nlately; the cheucau (an odd red-breasted little bird, which inhabits\r\nthe thick forest, and utters very peculiar noises) has not cried\r\n'beware' for nothing.\" They were soon anxious for barter.  Money was\r\nscarcely worth anything, but their eagerness for tobacco was something\r\nquite extraordinary.  After tobacco, indigo came next in value; then\r\ncapsicum, old clothes, and gunpowder.  The latter article was required\r\nfor a very innocent purpose: each parish has a public musket, and the\r\ngunpowder was wanted for making a noise on their saint or feast days.\r\n\r\nThe people here live chiefly on shell-fish and potatoes.  At certain\r\nseasons they catch also, in \"corrales,\" or hedges under water, many\r\nfish which are left on the mud-banks as the tide falls.  They\r\noccasionally possess fowls, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle; the\r\norder in which they are here mentioned, expressing their respective\r\nnumbers.  I never saw anything more obliging and humble than the\r\nmanners of these people.  They generally began with stating that they\r\nwere poor natives of the place, and not Spaniards and that they were in\r\nsad want of tobacco and other comforts. At Caylen, the most southern\r\nisland, the sailors bought with a stick of tobacco, of the value of\r\nthree-halfpence, two fowls, one of which, the Indian stated, had skin\r\nbetween its toes, and turned out to be a fine duck; and with some\r\ncotton handkerchiefs, worth three shillings, three sheep and a large\r\nbunch of onions were procured.  The yawl at this place was anchored\r\nsome way from the shore, and we had fears for her safety from robbers\r\nduring the night.  Our pilot, Mr. Douglas, accordingly told the\r\nconstable of the district that we always placed sentinels with loaded\r\narms and not understanding Spanish, if we saw any person in the dark,\r\nwe should assuredly shoot him.  The constable, with much humility,\r\nagreed to the perfect propriety of this arrangement, and promised us\r\nthat no one should stir out of his house during that night.\r\n\r\nDuring the four succeeding days we continued sailing southward.  The\r\ngeneral features of the country remained the same, but it was much less\r\nthickly inhabited.  On the large island of Tanqui there was scarcely\r\none cleared spot, the trees on every side extending their branches over\r\nthe sea-beach.  I one day noticed, growing on the sandstone cliffs,\r\nsome very fine plants of the panke (Gunnera scabra), which somewhat\r\nresembles the rhubarb on a gigantic scale. The inhabitants eat the\r\nstalks, which are subacid, and tan leather with the roots, and prepare\r\na black dye from them. The leaf is nearly circular, but deeply indented\r\non its margin. I measured one which was nearly eight feet in diameter,\r\nand therefore no less than twenty-four in circumference! The stalk is\r\nrather more than a yard high, and each plant sends out four or five of\r\nthese enormous leaves, presenting together a very noble appearance.\r\n\r\nDecember 6th.--We reached Caylen, called \"el fin del Cristiandad.\" In\r\nthe morning we stopped for a few minutes at a house on the northern end\r\nof Laylec, which was the extreme point of South American Christendom,\r\nand a miserable hovel it was.  The latitude is 43 degs. 10', which is\r\ntwo degrees farther south than the Rio Negro on the Atlantic coast.\r\nThese extreme Christians were very poor, and, under the plea of their\r\nsituation, begged for some tobacco.  As a proof of the poverty of these\r\nIndians, I may mention that shortly before this, we had met a man, who\r\nhad travelled three days and a half on foot, and had as many to return,\r\nfor the sake of recovering the value of a small axe and a few fish. How\r\nvery difficult it must be to buy the smallest article, when such\r\ntrouble is taken to recover so small a debt.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we reached the island of San Pedro, where we found the\r\nBeagle at anchor.  In doubling the point, two of the officers landed to\r\ntake a round of angles with the theodolite.  A fox (Canis fulvipes), of\r\na kind said to be peculiar to the island, and very rare in it, and\r\nwhich is a new species, was sitting on the rocks.  He was so intently\r\nabsorbed in watching the work of the officers, that I was able, by\r\nquietly walking up behind, to knock him on the head with my geological\r\nhammer.  This fox, more curious or more scientific, but less wise, than\r\nthe generality of his brethren, is now mounted in the museum of the\r\nZoological Society.\r\n\r\nWe stayed three days in this harbour, on one of  which Captain Fitz\r\nRoy, with a party, attempted to ascend to the summit of San Pedro.  The\r\nwoods here had rather a different appearance from those on the northern\r\npart of the island. The rock, also, being micaceous slate, there was no\r\nbeach, but the steep sides dipped directly beneath the water.  The\r\ngeneral aspect in consequence was more like that of Tierra del Fuego\r\nthan of Chiloe.  In vain we tried to gain the summit: the forest was so\r\nimpenetrable, that no one who has not beheld it can imagine so\r\nentangled a mass of dying and dead trunks.  I am sure that often, for\r\nmore than ten minutes together, our feet never touched the ground, and\r\nwe were frequently ten or fifteen feet above it, so that the seamen as\r\na joke called out the soundings.  At other times we crept one after\r\nanother on our hands and knees, under the rotten trunks.  In the lower\r\npart of the mountain, noble trees of the Winter's Bark, and a laurel\r\nlike the sassafras with fragrant leaves, and others, the names of which\r\nI do not know, were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane. Here\r\nwe were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal.  On\r\nthe higher parts, brushwood takes the place of larger trees, with here\r\nand there a red cedar or an alerce pine.  I was also pleased to see, at\r\nan elevation of a little less than 1000 feet, our old friend the\r\nsouthern beech. They were, however, poor stunted trees, and I should\r\nthink that this must be nearly their northern limit.  We ultimately\r\ngave up the attempt in despair.\r\n\r\nDecember 10th.--The yawl and whale-boat, with Mr. Sulivan, proceeded on\r\ntheir survey, but I remained on board the Beagle, which the next day\r\nleft San Pedro for the southward. On the 13th we ran into an opening in\r\nthe southern part of Guayatecas, or the Chonos Archipelago; and it was\r\nfortunate we did so, for on the following day a storm, worthy of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego, raged with great fury.  White massive clouds were piled up\r\nagainst a dark blue sky, and across them black ragged sheets of vapour\r\nwere rapidly driven.  The successive mountain ranges appeared like dim\r\nshadows, and the setting sun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam, much\r\nlike that produced by the flame of spirits of wine.  The water was\r\nwhite with the flying spray, and the wind lulled and roared again\r\nthrough the rigging: it was an ominous, sublime scene.  During a few\r\nminutes there was a bright rainbow, and it was curious to observe the\r\neffect of the spray, which being carried along the surface of the\r\nwater, changed the ordinary semicircle into a circle--a band of\r\nprismatic colours being continued, from both feet of the common arch\r\nacross the bay, close to the vessel's side: thus forming a distorted,\r\nbut very nearly entire ring.\r\n\r\nWe stayed here three days.  The weather continued bad: but this did not\r\nmuch signify, for the surface of the land in all these islands is all\r\nbut impassable.  The coast is so very rugged that to attempt to walk in\r\nthat direction requires continued scrambling up and down over the sharp\r\nrocks of mica-slate; and as for the woods, our faces, hands, and\r\nshin-bones all bore witness to the maltreatment we received, in merely\r\nattempting to penetrate their forbidden recesses.\r\n\r\nDecember 18th.--We stood out to sea.  On the 20th we bade farewell to\r\nthe south, and with a fair wind turned the ship's head northward.  From\r\nCape Tres Montes we sailed pleasantly along the lofty weather-beaten\r\ncoast, which is remarkable for the bold outline of its hills, and the\r\nthick covering of forest even on the almost precipitous flanks.  The\r\nnext day a harbour was discovered, which on this dangerous coast might\r\nbe of great service to a distressed vessel.  It can easily be\r\nrecognized by a hill 1600 feet high, which is even more perfectly\r\nconical than the famous sugar-loaf at Rio de Janeiro.  The next day,\r\nafter anchoring, I succeeded in reaching the summit of this hill.  It\r\nwas a laborious undertaking, for the sides were so steep that in some\r\nparts it was necessary to use the trees as ladders.  There were also\r\nseveral extensive brakes of the Fuchsia, covered with its beautiful\r\ndrooping flowers, but very difficult to crawl through. In these wild\r\ncountries it gives much delight to gain the summit of any mountain.\r\nThere is an indefinite expectation of seeing something very strange,\r\nwhich, however often it may be balked, never failed with me to recur on\r\neach successive attempt.  Every one must know the feeling of triumph\r\nand pride which a grand view from a height communicates to the mind. In\r\nthese little frequented countries there is also joined to it some\r\nvanity, that you perhaps are the first man who ever stood on this\r\npinnacle or admired this view.\r\n\r\nA strong desire is always felt to ascertain whether any human being has\r\npreviously visited an unfrequented spot. A bit of wood with a nail in\r\nit, is picked up and studied as if it were covered with hieroglyphics.\r\nPossessed with this feeling, I was much interested by finding, on a\r\nwild part of the coast, a bed made of grass beneath a ledge of rock.\r\nClose by it there had been a fire, and the man had used an axe. The\r\nfire, bed, and situation showed the dexterity of an Indian; but he\r\ncould scarcely have been an Indian, for the race is in this part\r\nextinct, owing to the Catholic desire of making at one blow Christians\r\nand Slaves.  I had at the time some misgivings that the solitary man\r\nwho had made his bed on this wild spot, must have been some poor\r\nshipwrecked sailor, who, in trying to travel up the coast, had here\r\nlaid himself down for his dreary night.\r\n\r\nDecember 28th.--The weather continued very bad, but it at last\r\npermitted us to proceed with the survey.  The time hung heavy on our\r\nhands, as it always did when we were delayed from day to day by\r\nsuccessive gales of wind.  In the evening another harbour was\r\ndiscovered, where we anchored.  Directly afterwards a man was seen\r\nwaving a shirt, and a boat was sent which brought back two seamen. A\r\nparty of six had run away from an American whaling vessel, and had\r\nlanded a little to the southward in a boat, which was shortly\r\nafterwards knocked to pieces by the surf. They had now been wandering\r\nup and down the coast for fifteen months, without knowing which way to\r\ngo, or where they were.  What a singular piece of good fortune it was\r\nthat this harbour was now discovered!  Had it not been for this one\r\nchance, they might have wandered till they had grown old men, and at\r\nlast have perished on this wild coast. Their sufferings had been very\r\ngreat, and one of their party had lost his life by falling from the\r\ncliffs.  They were sometimes obliged to separate in search of food, and\r\nthis explained the bed of the solitary man.  Considering what they had\r\nundergone, I think they had kept a very good reckoning of time, for\r\nthey had lost only four days.\r\n\r\nDecember 30th.--We anchored in a snug little cove at the foot of some\r\nhigh hills, near the northern extremity of Tres Montes.  After\r\nbreakfast the next morning, a party ascended one of these mountains,\r\nwhich was 2400 feet high.  The scenery was remarkable The chief part of\r\nthe range was composed of grand, solid, abrupt masses of granite, which\r\nappeared as if they had been coeval with the beginning of the world.\r\nThe granite was capped with mica-slate, and this in the lapse of ages\r\nhad been worn into strange finger-shaped points.  These two formations,\r\nthus differing in their outlines, agree in being almost destitute of\r\nvegetation.  This barrenness had to our eyes a strange appearance, from\r\nhaving been so long accustomed to the sight of an almost universal\r\nforest of dark-green trees.  I took much delight in examining the\r\nstructure of these mountains.  The complicated and lofty ranges bore a\r\nnoble aspect of durability--equally profitless, however, to man and to\r\nall other animals.  Granite to the geologist is classic ground: from\r\nits widespread limits, and its beautiful and compact texture, few rocks\r\nhave been more anciently recognised.  Granite has given rise, perhaps,\r\nto more discussion concerning its origin than any other formation. We\r\ngenerally see it constituting the fundamental rock, and, however\r\nformed, we know it is the deepest layer in the crust of this globe to\r\nwhich man has penetrated.  The limit of man's knowledge in any subject\r\npossesses a high interest, which is perhaps increased by its close\r\nneighbourhood to the realms of imagination.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1st 1835.--The new year is ushered in with the ceremonies\r\nproper to it in these regions.  She lays out no false hopes: a heavy\r\nnorth-western gale, with steady rain, bespeaks the rising year.  Thank\r\nGod, we are not destined here to see the end of it, but hope then to be\r\nin the Pacific Ocean, where a blue sky tells one there is a heaven,--a\r\nsomething beyond the clouds above our heads.\r\n\r\nThe north-west winds prevailing for the next four days, we only managed\r\nto cross a great bay, and then anchored in another secure harbour.  I\r\naccompanied the Captain in a boat to the head of a deep creek.  On the\r\nway the number of seals which we saw was quite astonishing: every bit\r\nof flat rock, and parts of the beach, were covered with them.  There\r\nappeared to be of a loving disposition, and lay huddled together, fast\r\nasleep, like so many pigs; but even pigs would have been ashamed of\r\ntheir dirt, and of the foul smell which came from them.  Each herd was\r\nwatched by the patient but inauspicious eyes of the turkey-buzzard.\r\nThis disgusting bird, with its bald scarlet head, formed to wallow in\r\nputridity, is very common on the west coast, and their attendance on\r\nthe seals shows on what they rely for their food.  We found the water\r\n(probably only that of the surface) nearly fresh: this was caused by\r\nthe number of torrents which, in the form of cascades, came tumbling\r\nover the bold granite mountains into the sea.  The fresh water attracts\r\nthe fish, and these bring many terns, gulls, and two kinds of\r\ncormorant.  We saw also a pair of the beautiful black-necked swans, and\r\nseveral small sea-otters, the fur of which is held in such high\r\nestimation.  In returning, we were again amused by the impetuous manner\r\nin which the heap of seals, old and young, tumbled into the water as\r\nthe boat passed.  They did not remain long under water, but rising,\r\nfollowed us with outstretched necks, expressing great wonder and\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n7th.--Having run up the coast, we anchored near the northern end of the\r\nChonos Archipelago, in Low's Harbour, where we remained a week. The\r\nislands were here, as in Chiloe, composed of a stratified, soft,\r\nlittoral deposit; and the vegetation in consequence was beautifully\r\nluxuriant.  The woods came down to the sea-beach, just in the manner of\r\nan evergreen shrubbery over a gravel walk.  We also enjoyed from the\r\nanchorage a splendid view of four great snowy cones of the Cordillera,\r\nincluding \"el famoso Corcovado;\" the range itself had in this latitude\r\nso little height, that few parts of it appeared above the tops of the\r\nneighbouring islets.  We found here a party of five men from Caylen,\r\n\"el fin del Cristiandad,\" who had most adventurously crossed in their\r\nmiserable boat-canoe, for the purpose of fishing, the open space of sea\r\nwhich separates Chonos from Chiloe.  These islands will, in all\r\nprobability, in a short time become peopled like those adjoining the\r\ncoast of Chiloe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wild potato grows on these islands in great abundance, on the\r\nsandy, shelly soil near the sea-beach.  The tallest plant was four feet\r\nin height.  The tubers were generally small, but I found one, of an\r\noval shape, two inches in diameter: they resembled in every respect,\r\nand had the same smell as English potatoes; but when boiled they shrunk\r\nmuch, and were watery and insipid, without any bitter taste.  They are\r\nundoubtedly here indigenous: they grow as far south, according to Mr.\r\nLow, as lat. 50 degs., and are called Aquinas by the wild Indians of\r\nthat part: the Chilotan Indians have a different name for them.\r\nProfessor Henslow, who has examined the dried specimens which I brought\r\nhome, says that they are the same with those described by Mr. Sabine\r\n[1] from Valparaiso, but that they form a variety which by some\r\nbotanists has been considered as specifically distinct.  It is\r\nremarkable that the same plant should be found on the sterile mountains\r\nof central Chile, where a drop of rain does not fall for more than six\r\nmonths, and within the damp forests of these southern islands.\r\n\r\nIn the central parts of the Chonos Archipelago (lat. 45 degs.), the\r\nforest has very much the same character with that along the whole west\r\ncoast, for 600 miles southward to Cape Horn. The arborescent grass of\r\nChiloe is not found here; while the beech of Tierra del Fuego grows to\r\na good size, and forms a considerable proportion of the wood; not,\r\nhowever, in the same exclusive manner as it does farther southward.\r\nCryptogamic plants here find a most congenial climate.  In the Strait\r\nof Magellan, as I have before remarked, the country appears too cold\r\nand wet to allow of their arriving at perfection; but in these islands,\r\nwithin the forest, the number of species and great abundance of mosses,\r\nlichens, and small ferns, is quite extraordinary. [2] In Tierra del\r\nFuego trees grow only on the hill-sides; every level piece of land\r\nbeing invariably covered by a thick bed of peat; but in Chiloe flat\r\nland supports the most luxuriant forests.  Here, within the Chonos\r\nArchipelago, the nature of the climate more closely approaches that of\r\nTierra del Fuego than that of northern Chiloe; for every patch of level\r\nground is covered by two species of plants (Astelia pumila and Donatia\r\nmagellanica), which by their joint decay compose a thick bed of elastic\r\npeat.\r\n\r\nIn Tierra del Fuego, above the region of woodland, the former of these\r\neminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the production of peat.\r\nFresh leaves are always succeeding one to the other round the central\r\ntap-root, the lower ones soon decay, and in tracing a root downwards in\r\nthe peat, the leaves, yet holding their place, can be observed passing\r\nthrough every stage of decomposition, till the whole becomes blended in\r\none confused mass.  The Astelia is assisted by a few other\r\nplants,--here and there a small creeping Myrtus (M. nummularia), with a\r\nwoody stem like our cranberry and with a sweet berry,--an Empetrum (E.\r\nrubrum), like our heath,--a rush (Juncus grandiflorus), are nearly the\r\nonly ones that grow on the swampy surface.  These plants, though\r\npossessing a very close general resemblance to the English species of\r\nthe same genera, are different.  In the more level parts of the\r\ncountry, the surface of the peat is broken up into little pools of\r\nwater, which stand at different heights, and appear as if artificially\r\nexcavated.  Small streams of water, flowing underground, complete the\r\ndisorganization of the vegetable matter, and consolidate the whole.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the southern part of America appears particularly\r\nfavourable to the production of peat.  In the Falkland Islands almost\r\nevery kind of plant, even the coarse grass which covers the whole\r\nsurface of the land, becomes converted into this substance: scarcely\r\nany situation checks its growth; some of the beds are as much as twelve\r\nfeet thick, and the lower part becomes so solid when dry, that it will\r\nhardly burn.  Although every plant lends its aid, yet in most parts the\r\nAstelia is the most efficient.  It is rather a singular circumstance,\r\nas being so very different from what occurs in Europe, that I nowhere\r\nsaw moss forming by its decay any portion of the peat in South America.\r\nWith respect to the northern limit, at which the climate allows of that\r\npeculiar kind of slow decomposition which is necessary for its\r\nproduction, I believe that in Chiloe (lat. 41 to 42 degs.), although\r\nthere is much swampy ground, no well-characterized peat occurs: but in\r\nthe Chonos Islands, three degrees farther southward, we have seen that\r\nit is abundant.  On the eastern coast in La Plata (lat. 35 degs.) I was\r\ntold by a Spanish resident who had visited Ireland, that he had often\r\nsought for this substance, but had never been able to find any.  He\r\nshowed me, as the nearest approach to it which he had discovered, a\r\nblack peaty soil, so penetrated with roots as to allow of an extremely\r\nslow and imperfect combustion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe zoology of these broken islets of the Chonos Archipelago is, as\r\nmight have been expected, very poor.  Of quadrupeds two aquatic kinds\r\nare common.  The Myopotamus Coypus (like a beaver, but with a round\r\ntail) is well known from its fine fur, which is an object of trade\r\nthroughout the tributaries of La Plata.  It here, however, exclusively\r\nfrequents salt water; which same circumstance has been mentioned as\r\nsometimes occurring with the great rodent, the Capybara.  A small\r\nsea-otter is very numerous; this animal does not feed exclusively on\r\nfish, but, like the seals, draws a large supply from a small red crab,\r\nwhich swims in shoals near the surface of the water.  Mr. Bynoe saw one\r\nin Tierra del Fuego eating a cuttle-fish; and at Low's Harbour, another\r\nwas killed in the act of carrying to its hole a large volute shell.  At\r\none place I caught in a trap a singular little mouse (M. brachiotis);\r\nit appeared common on several of the islets, but the Chilotans at Low's\r\nHarbour said that it was not found in all.  What a succession of\r\nchances, [3] or what changes of level must have been brought into play,\r\nthus to spread these small animals throughout this broken archipelago!\r\n\r\nIn all parts of Chiloe and Chonos, two very strange birds occur, which\r\nare allied to, and replace, the Turco and Tapacolo of central Chile.\r\nOne is called by the inhabitants \"Cheucau\" (Pteroptochos rubecula): it\r\nfrequents the most gloomy and retired spots within the damp forests.\r\nSometimes, although its cry may be heard close at hand, let a person\r\nwatch ever so attentively he will not see the cheucau; at other times,\r\nlet him stand motionless and the red-breasted little bird will approach\r\nwithin a few feet in the most familiar manner.  It then busily hops\r\nabout the entangled mass of rotting cones and branches, with its little\r\ntail cocked upwards. The cheucau is held in superstitious fear by the\r\nChilotans, on account of its strange and varied cries.  There are three\r\nvery distinct cries: One is called \"chiduco,\" and is an omen of good;\r\nanother, \"huitreu,\" which is extremely unfavourable; and a third, which\r\nI have forgotten.  These words are given in imitation of the noises;\r\nand the natives are in some things absolutely governed by them.  The\r\nChilotans assuredly have chosen a most comical little creature for\r\ntheir prophet. An allied species, but rather larger, is called by the\r\nnatives \"Guid-guid\" (Pteroptochos Tarnii), and by the English the\r\nbarking-bird.  This latter name is well given; for I defy any one at\r\nfirst to feel certain that a small dog is not yelping somewhere in the\r\nforest.  Just as with the cheucau, a person will sometimes hear the\r\nbark close by, but in vain many endeavour by watching, and with still\r\nless chance by beating the bushes, to see the bird; yet at other times\r\nthe guid-guid fearlessly comes near.  Its manner of feeding and its\r\ngeneral habits are very similar to those of the cheucau.\r\n\r\nOn the coast, [4] a small dusky-coloured bird (Opetiorhynchus\r\nPatagonicus) is very common.  It is remarkable from its quiet habits;\r\nit lives entirely on the sea-beach, like a sandpiper.  Besides these\r\nbirds only few others inhabit this broken land.  In my rough notes I\r\ndescribe the strange noises, which, although frequently heard within\r\nthese gloomy forests, yet scarcely disturb the general silence.  The\r\nyelping of the guid-guid, and the sudden whew-whew of the cheucau,\r\nsometimes come from afar off, and sometimes from close at hand; the\r\nlittle black wren of Tierra del Fuego occasionally adds its cry; the\r\ncreeper (Oxyurus) follows the intruder screaming and twittering; the\r\nhumming-bird may be seen every now and then darting from side to side,\r\nand emitting, like an insect, its shrill chirp; lastly, from the top of\r\nsome lofty tree the indistinct but plaintive note of the white-tufted\r\ntyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius) may be noticed. From the great\r\npreponderance in most countries of certain common genera of birds, such\r\nas the finches, one feels at first surprised at meeting with the\r\npeculiar forms above enumerated, as the commonest birds in any\r\ndistrict.  In central Chile two of them, namely, the Oxyurus and\r\nScytalopus, occur, although most rarely.  When finding, as in this\r\ncase, animals which seem to play so insignificant a part in the great\r\nscheme of nature, one is apt to wonder why they were created.\r\n\r\nBut it should always be recollected, that in some other country perhaps\r\nthey are essential members of society, or at some former period may\r\nhave been so.  If America south of 37 degs. were sunk beneath the\r\nwaters of the ocean, these two birds might continue to exist in central\r\nChile for a long period, but it is very improbable that their numbers\r\nwould increase.  We should then see a case which must inevitably have\r\nhappened with very many animals.\r\n\r\nThese southern seas are frequented by several species of Petrels: the\r\nlargest kind, Procellaria gigantea, or nelly (quebrantahuesos, or\r\nbreak-bones, of the Spaniards), is a common bird, both in the inland\r\nchannels and on the open sea. In its habits and manner of flight, there\r\nis a very close resemblance with the albatross; and as with the\r\nalbatross, a person may watch it for hours together without seeing on\r\nwhat it feeds.  The \"break-bones\" is, however, a rapacious bird, for it\r\nwas observed by some of the officers at Port St. Antonio chasing a\r\ndiver, which tried to escape by diving and flying, but was continually\r\nstruck down, and at last killed by a blow on its head.  At Port St.\r\nJulian these great petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls.\r\nA second species (Puffinus cinereus), which is common to Europe, Cape\r\nHorn, and the coast of Peru, is of much smaller size than the P.\r\ngigantea, but, like it, of a dirty black colour.  It generally\r\nfrequents the inland sounds in very large flocks: I do not think I ever\r\nsaw so many birds of any other sort together, as I once saw of these\r\nbehind the island of Chiloe. Hundreds of thousands flew in an irregular\r\nline for several hours in one direction.  When part of the flock\r\nsettled on the water the surface was blackened, and a noise proceeded\r\nfrom them as of human beings talking in the distance.\r\n\r\nThere are several other species of petrels, but I will only mention one\r\nother kind, the Pelacanoides Berardi which offers an example of those\r\nextraordinary cases, of a bird evidently belonging to one well-marked\r\nfamily, yet both in its habits and structure allied to a very distinct\r\ntribe.  This bird never leaves the quiet inland sounds.  When disturbed\r\nit dives to a distance, and on coming to the surface, with the same\r\nmovement takes flight.  After flying by a rapid movement of its short\r\nwings for a space in a straight line, it drops, as if struck dead, and\r\ndives again.  The form of its beak and nostrils, length of foot, and\r\neven the colouring of its plumage, show that this bird is a petrel: on\r\nthe other hand, its short wings and consequent little power of flight,\r\nits form of body and shape of tail, the absence of a hind toe to its\r\nfoot, its habit of diving, and its choice of situation, make it at\r\nfirst doubtful whether its relationship is not equally close with the\r\nauks.  It would undoubtedly be mistaken for an auk, when seen from a\r\ndistance, either on the wing, or when diving and quietly swimming about\r\nthe retired channels of Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\n[1] Horticultural Transact., vol. v. p. 249. Mr. Caldeleugh sent home\r\ntwo tubers, which, being well manured, even the first season produced\r\nnumerous potatoes and an abundance of leaves.  See Humboldt's\r\ninteresting discussion on this plant, which it appears was unknown in\r\nMexico,--in Polit. Essay on New Spain, book iv. chap. ix.\r\n\r\n[2] By sweeping with my insect-net, I procured from these situations a\r\nconsiderable number of minute insects, of the family of Staphylinidae,\r\nand others allied to Pselaphus, and minute Hymenoptera.  But the most\r\ncharacteristic family in number, both of individuals and species,\r\nthroughout the more open parts of Chiloe and Chonos is that of\r\nTelephoridae.\r\n\r\n[3] It is said that some rapacious birds bring their prey alive to\r\ntheir nests.  If so, in the course of centuries, every now and then,\r\none might escape from the young birds. Some such agency is necessary,\r\nto account for the distribution of the smaller gnawing animals on\r\nislands not very near each other.\r\n\r\n[4] I may mention, as a proof of how great a difference there is\r\nbetween the seasons of the wooded and the open parts of this coast,\r\nthat on September 20th, in lat. 34 degs., these birds had young ones in\r\nthe nest, while among the Chonos Islands, three months later in the\r\nsummer, they were only laying, the difference in latitude between these\r\ntwo places being about 700 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCHILOE AND CONCEPCION: GREAT EARTHQUAKE\r\n\r\nSan Carlos, Chiloe--Osorno in eruption, contemporaneously with\r\nAconcagua and Coseguina--Ride to Cucao--Impenetrable Forests--Valdivia\r\nIndians--Earthquake--Concepcion--Great Earthquake--Rocks\r\nfissured--Appearance of the former Towns--The Sea Black and\r\nBoiling--Direction of the Vibrations--Stones twisted round--Great\r\nWave--Permanent Elevation of the Land--Area of Volcanic Phenomena--The\r\nconnection between the Elevatory and Eruptive Forces--Cause of\r\nEarthquakes--Slow Elevation of Mountain-chains.\r\n\r\n\r\nON JANUARY the 15th we sailed from Low's Harbour, and three days\r\nafterwards anchored a second time in the bay of S. Carlos in Chiloe. On\r\nthe night of the 19th the volcano of Osorno was in action.  At midnight\r\nthe sentry observed something like a large star, which gradually\r\nincreased in size till about three o'clock, when it presented a very\r\nmagnificent spectacle.  By the aid of a glass, dark objects, in\r\nconstant succession, were seen, in the midst of a great glare of red\r\nlight, to be thrown up and to fall down. The light was sufficient to\r\ncast on the water a long bright reflection.  Large masses of molten\r\nmatter seem very commonly to be cast out of the craters in this part of\r\nthe Cordillera. I was assured that when the Corcovado is in eruption,\r\ngreat masses are projected upwards and are seen to burst in the air,\r\nassuming many fantastical forms, such as trees: their size must be\r\nimmense, for they can be distinguished from the high land behind S.\r\nCarlos, which is no less than ninety-three miles from the Corcovado. In\r\nthe morning the volcano became tranquil.\r\n\r\nI was surprised at hearing afterwards that Aconcagua in Chile, 480\r\nmiles northwards, was in action on the same night; and still more\r\nsurprised to hear that the great eruption of Coseguina (2700 miles\r\nnorth of Aconcagua), accompanied by an earthquake felt over a 1000\r\nmiles, also occurred within six  hours of this same time.  This\r\ncoincidence is the more remarkable, as Coseguina had been dormant for\r\ntwenty-six years; and Aconcagua most rarely shows any signs of action.\r\nIt is difficult even to conjecture whether this coincidence was\r\naccidental, or shows some subterranean connection.  If Vesuvius, Etna,\r\nand Hecla in Iceland (all three relatively nearer each other than the\r\ncorresponding points in South America), suddenly burst forth in\r\neruption on the same night, the coincidence would be thought\r\nremarkable; but it is far more remarkable in this case, where the three\r\nvents fall on the same great mountain-chain, and where the vast plains\r\nalong the entire eastern coast, and the upraised recent shells along\r\nmore than 2000 miles on the western coast, show in how equable and\r\nconnected a manner the elevatory forces have acted.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy being anxious that some bearings should be taken on\r\nthe outer coast of Chiloe, it was planned that Mr. King and myself\r\nshould ride to Castro, and thence across the island to the Capella de\r\nCucao, situated on the west coast.  Having hired horses and a guide, we\r\nset out on the morning of the 22nd.  We had not proceeded far, before\r\nwe were joined by a woman and two boys, who were bent on the same\r\njourney.  Every one on this road acts on a \"hail fellow well met\"\r\nfashion; and one may here enjoy the privilege, so rare in South\r\nAmerica, of travelling without fire-arms. At first, the country\r\nconsisted of a succession of hills and valleys: nearer to Castro it\r\nbecame very level.  The road itself is a curious affair; it consists in\r\nits whole length, with the exception of very few parts, of great logs\r\nof wood, which are either broad and laid longitudinally, or narrow and\r\nplaced transversely.  In summer the road is not very bad; but in\r\nwinter, when the wood is rendered slippery from rain, travelling is\r\nexceedingly difficult.  At that time of the year, the ground on each\r\nside becomes a morass, and is often overflowed: hence it is necessary\r\nthat the longitudinal logs should be fastened down by transverse poles,\r\nwhich are pegged on each side into the earth.  These pegs render a fall\r\nfrom a horse dangerous, as the chance of alighting on one of them is\r\nnot small.  It is remarkable, however, how active custom has made the\r\nChilotan horses.  In crossing bad parts, where the logs had been\r\ndisplaced, they skipped from one to the other, almost with the\r\nquickness and certainty of a dog.  On both hands the road is bordered\r\nby the lofty forest-trees, with their bases matted together by canes.\r\nWhen occasionally a long reach of this avenue could be beheld, it\r\npresented a curious scene of uniformity: the white line of logs,\r\nnarrowing in perspective, became hidden by the gloomy forest, or\r\nterminated in a zigzag which ascended some steep hill.\r\n\r\nAlthough the distance from S. Carlos to Castro is only twelve leagues\r\nin a straight line, the formation of the road must have been a great\r\nlabour.  I was told that several people had formerly lost their lives\r\nin attempting to cross the forest.  The first who succeeded was an\r\nIndian, who cut his way through the canes in eight days, and reached S.\r\nCarlos: he was rewarded by the Spanish government with a grant of land.\r\nDuring the summer, many of the Indians wander about the forests (but\r\nchiefly in the higher parts, where the woods are not quite so thick) in\r\nsearch of the half-wild cattle which live on the leaves of the cane and\r\ncertain trees.  It was one of these huntsmen who by chance discovered,\r\na few years since, an English vessel, which had been wrecked on the\r\nouter coast.  The crew were beginning to fail in provisions, and it is\r\nnot probable that, without the aid of this man, they would ever have\r\nextricated themselves from these scarcely penetrable woods.  As it was,\r\none seaman died on the march, from fatigue.  The Indians in these\r\nexcursions steer by the sun; so that if there is a continuance of\r\ncloudy weather, they can not travel.\r\n\r\nThe day was beautiful, and the number of trees which were in full\r\nflower perfumed the air; yet even this could hardly dissipate the\r\neffects of the gloomy dampness of the forest.  Moreover, the many dead\r\ntrunks that stand like skeletons, never fail to give to these primeval\r\nwoods a character of solemnity, absent in those of countries long\r\ncivilized.  Shortly after sunset we bivouacked for the night.  Our\r\nfemale companion, who was rather good-looking, belonged to one of the\r\nmost respectable families in Castro: she rode, however, astride, and\r\nwithout shoes or stockings.  I was surprised at the total want of pride\r\nshown by her and her brother.  They  brought food with them, but at all\r\nour meals sat watching Mr. King and myself whilst eating, till we were\r\nfairly shamed into feeding the whole party.  The night was cloudless;\r\nand while lying in our beds, we enjoyed the sight (and it is a high\r\nenjoyment) of the multitude of stars which illumined the darkness of\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nJanuary 23rd.--We rose early in the morning, and reached the pretty\r\nquiet town of Castro by two o'clock.  The old governor had died since\r\nour last visit, and a Chileno was acting in his place.  We had a letter\r\nof introduction to Don Pedro, whom we found exceedingly hospitable and\r\nkind, and more disinterested than is usual on this side of the\r\ncontinent.  The next day Don Pedro procured us fresh horses, and\r\noffered to accompany us himself.  We proceeded to the south--generally\r\nfollowing the coast, and passing through several hamlets, each with its\r\nlarge barn-like chapel built of wood.  At Vilipilli, Don Pedro asked\r\nthe commandant to give us a guide to Cucao.  The old gentleman offered\r\nto come himself; but for a long time nothing would persuade him that\r\ntwo Englishmen really wished to go to such an out-of-the-way place as\r\nCucao.  We were thus accompanied by the two greatest aristocrats in the\r\ncountry, as was plainly to be seen in the manner of all the poorer\r\nIndians towards them.  At Chonchi we struck across the island,\r\nfollowing intricate winding paths, sometimes passing through\r\nmagnificent forests, and sometimes through pretty cleared spots,\r\nabounding with corn and potato crops.  This undulating woody country,\r\npartially cultivated, reminded me of the wilder parts of England, and\r\ntherefore had to my eye a most fascinating aspect.  At Vilinco, which\r\nis situated on the borders of the lake of Cucao, only a few fields were\r\ncleared; and all the inhabitants appeared to be Indians.  This lake is\r\ntwelve miles long, and runs in an east and west direction.  From local\r\ncircumstances, the sea-breeze blows very regularly during the day, and\r\nduring the night it falls calm: this has given rise to strange\r\nexaggerations, for the phenomenon, as described to us at S. Carlos, was\r\nquite a prodigy.\r\n\r\nThe road to Cucao was so very bad that we determined to embark in a\r\n_periagua_.  The commandant, in the most authoritative manner, ordered\r\nsix Indians to get ready to pull us over, without deigning to tell them\r\nwhether they would be paid.  The periagua is a strange rough boat, but\r\nthe crew were still stranger: I doubt if six uglier little men ever got\r\ninto a boat together.  They pulled, however, very well and cheerfully.\r\nThe stroke-oarsman gabbled Indian, and uttered strange cries, much\r\nafter the fashion of a pig-driver driving his pigs.  We started with a\r\nlight breeze against us, but yet reached the Capella de Cucao before it\r\nwas late.  The country on each side of the lake was one unbroken\r\nforest.  In the same periagua with us, a cow was embarked.  To get so\r\nlarge an animal into a small boat appears at first a difficulty, but\r\nthe Indians managed it in a minute.  They brought the cow alongside the\r\nboat, which was heeled towards her; then placing two oars under her\r\nbelly, with their ends resting on the gunwale, by the aid of these\r\nlevers they fairly tumbled the poor beast heels over head into the\r\nbottom of the boat, and then lashed her down with ropes.  At Cucao we\r\nfound an uninhabited hovel (which is the residence of the padre when he\r\npays this Capella a visit), where, lighting a fire, we cooked our\r\nsupper, and were very comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe district of Cucao is the only inhabited part on the whole west\r\ncoast of Chiloe.  It contains about thirty or forty Indian families,\r\nwho are scattered along four or five miles of the shore.  They are very\r\nmuch secluded from the rest of Chiloe, and have scarcely any sort of\r\ncommerce, except sometimes in a little oil, which they get from\r\nseal-blubber. They are tolerably dressed in clothes of their own\r\nmanufacture, and they have plenty to eat.  They seemed, however,\r\ndiscontented, yet humble to a degree which it was quite painful to\r\nwitness.  These feelings are, I think, chiefly to be attributed to the\r\nharsh and authoritative manner in which they are treated by their\r\nrulers.  Our companions, although so very civil to us, behaved to the\r\npoor Indians as if they had been slaves, rather than free men.  They\r\nordered provisions and the use of their horses, without ever\r\ncondescending to say how much, or indeed whether the owners should be\r\npaid at all.  In the morning, being left alone with these poor people,\r\nwe soon ingratiated ourselves by presents of cigars and mate.  A lump\r\nof white sugar was divided between all present, and tasted with the\r\ngreatest curiosity.  The Indians ended all their complaints by saying,\r\n\"And it is only because we are poor Indians, and know nothing; but it\r\nwas not so when we had a King.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day after breakfast, we rode a few miles northward to Punta\r\nHuantamo.  The road lay along a very broad beach, on which, even after\r\nso many fine days, a terrible surf was breaking.  I was assured that\r\nafter a heavy gale, the roar can be heard at night even at Castro, a\r\ndistance of no less than twenty-one sea-miles across a hilly and wooded\r\ncountry.  We had some difficulty in reaching the point, owing to the\r\nintolerably bad paths; for everywhere in the shade the ground soon\r\nbecomes a perfect quagmire.  The point itself is a bold rocky hill.  It\r\nis covered by a plant allied, I believe, to Bromelia, and called by the\r\ninhabitants Chepones. In scrambling through the beds, our hands were\r\nvery much scratched.  I was amused by observing the precaution our\r\nIndian guide took, in turning up his trousers, thinking that they were\r\nmore delicate than his own hard skin.  This plant bears a fruit, in\r\nshape like an artichoke, in which a number of seed-vessels are packed:\r\nthese contain a pleasant sweet pulp, here much esteemed.  I saw at\r\nLow's Harbour the Chilotans making chichi, or cider, with this fruit:\r\nso true is it, as Humboldt remarks, that almost everywhere man finds\r\nmeans of preparing some kind of beverage from the vegetable kingdom.\r\nThe savages, however, of Tierra del Fuego, and I believe of Australia,\r\nhave not advanced thus far in the arts.\r\n\r\nThe coast to the north of Punta Huantamo is exceedingly rugged and\r\nbroken, and is fronted by many breakers, on which the sea is eternally\r\nroaring.  Mr. King and myself were anxious to return, if it had been\r\npossible, on foot along this coast; but even the Indians said it was\r\nquite impracticable.  We were told that men have crossed by striking\r\ndirectly through the woods from Cucao to S. Carlos, but never by the\r\ncoast.  On these expeditions, the Indians carry with them only roasted\r\ncorn, and of this they eat sparingly twice a day.\r\n\r\n26th.--Re-embarking in the periagua, we returned across the lake, and\r\nthen mounted our horses.  The whole of Chiloe took advantage of this\r\nweek of unusually fine weather, to clear the ground by burning.  In\r\nevery direction volumes of smoke were curling upwards.  Although the\r\ninhabitants were so assiduous in setting fire to every part of the\r\nwood, yet I did not see a single fire which they had succeeded in\r\nmaking extensive.  We dined with our friend the commandant, and did not\r\nreach Castro till after dark.  The next morning we started very early.\r\nAfter having ridden for some time, we obtained from the brow of a steep\r\nhill an extensive view (and it is a rare thing on this road) of the\r\ngreat forest. Over the horizon of trees, the volcano of Corcovado, and\r\nthe great flat-topped one to the north, stood out in proud\r\npre-eminence: scarcely another peak in the long range showed its snowy\r\nsummit.  I hope it will be long before I forget this farewell view of\r\nthe magnificent Cordillera fronting Chiloe.  At night we bivouacked\r\nunder a cloudless sky, and the next morning reached S. Carlos.  We\r\narrived on the right day, for before evening heavy rain commenced.\r\n\r\nFebruary 4th.--Sailed from Chiloe.  During the last week I made several\r\nshort excursions.  One was to examine a great bed of now-existing\r\nshells, elevated 350 feet above the level of the sea: from among these\r\nshells, large forest-trees were growing.  Another ride was to P.\r\nHuechucucuy. I had with me a guide who knew the country far too well;\r\nfor he would pertinaciously tell me endless Indian names for every\r\nlittle point, rivulet, and creek.  In the same manner as in Tierra del\r\nFuego, the Indian language appears singularly well adapted for\r\nattaching names to the most trivial features of the land.  I believe\r\nevery one was glad to say farewell to Chiloe; yet if we could forget\r\nthe gloom and ceaseless rain of winter, Chiloe might pass for a\r\ncharming island. There is also something very attractive in the\r\nsimplicity and humble politeness of the poor inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWe steered northward along shore, but owing to thick weather did not\r\nreach Valdivia till the night of the 8th.  The next morning the boat\r\nproceeded to the town, which is distant about ten miles.  We followed\r\nthe course of the river, occasionally passing a few hovels, and patches\r\nof ground cleared out of the otherwise unbroken forest; and sometimes\r\nmeeting a canoe with an Indian family.  The town is situated on the low\r\nbanks of the stream, and is so completely buried in a wood of\r\napple-trees that the streets are merely paths in an orchard. I have\r\nnever seen any country, where apple-trees appeared to thrive so well as\r\nin this damp part of South America: on the borders of the roads there\r\nwere many young trees evidently self-grown.  In Chiloe the inhabitants\r\npossess a marvellously short method of making an orchard.  At the lower\r\npart of almost every branch, small, conical, brown, wrinkled points\r\nproject: these are always ready to change into roots, as may sometimes\r\nbe seen, where any mud has been accidentally splashed against the tree.\r\nA branch as thick as a man's thigh is chosen in the early spring, and\r\nis cut off just beneath a group of these points, all the smaller\r\nbranches are lopped off, and it is then placed about two feet deep in\r\nthe ground.  During the ensuing summer the stump throws out long\r\nshoots, and sometimes even bears fruit: I was shown one which had\r\nproduced as many as twenty-three apples, but this was thought very\r\nunusual.  In the third season the stump is changed (as I have myself\r\nseen) into a well-wooded tree, loaded with fruit.  An old man near\r\nValdivia illustrated his motto, \"Necesidad es la madre del invencion,\"\r\nby giving an account of the several useful things he manufactured from\r\nhis apples.  After making cider, and likewise wine, he extracted from\r\nthe refuse a white and finely flavoured spirit; by another process he\r\nprocured a sweet treacle, or, as he called it, honey.  His children and\r\npigs seemed almost to live, during this season of the year, in his\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nFebruary 11th.--I set out with a guide on a short ride, in which,\r\nhowever, I managed to see singularly little, either of the geology of\r\nthe country or of its inhabitants.  There is not much cleared land near\r\nValdivia: after crossing a river at the distance of a few miles, we\r\nentered the forest, and then passed only one miserable hovel, before\r\nreaching our sleeping-place for the night.  The short difference in\r\nlatitude, of 150 miles, has given a new aspect to the forest compared\r\nwith that of Chiloe.  This is owing to a slightly different proportion\r\nin the kinds of trees.  The evergreens do not appear to be quite so\r\nnumerous, and the forest in consequence has a brighter tint.  As in\r\nChiloe, the lower parts are matted together by canes: here also another\r\nkind (resembling the bamboo of Brazil and about twenty feet in height)\r\ngrows in clusters, and ornaments the banks of some of the streams in a\r\nvery pretty manner.  It is with this plant that the Indians make their\r\nchuzos, or long tapering spears. Our resting-house was so dirty that I\r\npreferred sleeping outside: on these journeys the first night is\r\ngenerally very uncomfortable, because one is not accustomed to the\r\ntickling and biting of the fleas.  I am sure, in the morning, there was\r\nnot a space on my legs the size of a shilling which had not its little\r\nred mark where the flea had feasted.\r\n\r\n12th.--We continued to ride through the uncleared forest; only\r\noccasionally meeting an Indian on horseback, or a troop of fine mules\r\nbringing alerce-planks and corn from the southern plains.  In the\r\nafternoon one of the horses knocked up: we were then on a brow of a\r\nhill, which commanded a fine view of the Llanos.  The view of these\r\nopen plains was very refreshing, after being hemmed in and buried in\r\nthe wilderness of trees.  The uniformity of a forest soon becomes very\r\nwearisome.  This west coast makes me remember with pleasure the free,\r\nunbounded plains of Patagonia; yet, with the true spirit of\r\ncontradiction, I cannot forget how sublime is the silence of the\r\nforest.  The Llanos are the most fertile and thickly peopled parts of\r\nthe country, as they possess the immense advantage of being nearly free\r\nfrom trees.  Before leaving the forest we crossed some flat little\r\nlawns, around which single trees stood, as in an English park: I have\r\noften noticed with surprise, in wooded undulatory districts, that the\r\nquite level parts have been destitute of trees.  On account of the\r\ntired horse, I determined to stop at the Mission of Cudico, to the\r\nfriar of which I had a letter of introduction. Cudico is an\r\nintermediate district between the forest and the Llanos.  There are a\r\ngood many cottages, with patches of corn and potatoes, nearly all\r\nbelonging to Indians. The tribes dependent on Valdivia are \"reducidos y\r\ncristianos.\" The Indians farther northward, about Arauco and Imperial,\r\nare still very wild, and not converted; but they have all much\r\nintercourse with the Spaniards.  The padre said that the Christian\r\nIndians did not much like coming to mass, but that otherwise they\r\nshowed respect for religion. The greatest difficulty is in making them\r\nobserve the ceremonies of marriage.  The wild Indians take as many\r\nwives as they can support, and a cacique will sometimes have more than\r\nten: on entering his house, the number may be told by that of the\r\nseparate fires.  Each wife lives a week in turn with the cacique; but\r\nall are employed in weaving ponchos, etc., for his profit.  To be the\r\nwife of a cacique, is an honour much sought after by the Indian women.\r\n\r\nThe men of all these tribes wear a coarse woolen poncho: those south of\r\nValdivia wear short trousers, and those north of it a petticoat, like\r\nthe chilipa of the Gauchos.  All have their long hair bound by a\r\nscarlet fillet, but with no other covering on their heads.  These\r\nIndians are good-sized men; their cheek-bones are prominent, and in\r\ngeneral appearance they resemble the great American family to which\r\nthey belong; but their physiognomy seemed to me to be slightly\r\ndifferent from that of any other tribe which I had before seen.  Their\r\nexpression is generally grave, and even austere, and possesses much\r\ncharacter: this may pass either for honest bluntness or fierce\r\ndetermination.  The long black hair, the grave and much-lined features,\r\nand the dark complexion, called to my mind old portraits of James I. On\r\nthe road we met with none of that humble politeness so universal in\r\nChiloe.  Some gave their \"mari-mari\" (good morning) with promptness,\r\nbut the greater number did not seem inclined to offer any salute.  This\r\nindependence of manners is probably a consequence of their long wars,\r\nand the repeated victories which they alone, of all the tribes in\r\nAmerica, have gained over the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nI spent the evening very pleasantly, talking with the padre.  He was\r\nexceedingly kind and hospitable; and coming from Santiago, had\r\ncontrived to surround himself with some few comforts.  Being a man of\r\nsome little education, he bitterly complained of the total want of\r\nsociety.  With no particular zeal for religion, no business or pursuit,\r\nhow completely must this man's life be wasted!  The next day, on our\r\nreturn, we met seven very wild-looking Indians, of whom some were\r\ncaciques that had just received from the Chilian government their\r\nyearly small stipend for having long remained faithful.  They were\r\nfine-looking men, and they rode one after the other, with most gloomy\r\nfaces.  An old cacique, who headed them, had been, I suppose, more\r\nexcessively drunk than the rest, for he seemed extremely grave and very\r\ncrabbed.  Shortly before this, two Indians joined us, who were\r\ntravelling from a distant mission to Valdivia concerning some lawsuit.\r\nOne was a good-humoured old man, but from his wrinkled beardless face\r\nlooked more like an old woman than a man.  I frequently presented both\r\nof them with cigars; and though ready to receive them, and I dare say\r\ngrateful, they would hardly condescend to thank me.  A Chilotan Indian\r\nwould have taken off his hat, and given his \"Dios le page!\" The\r\ntravelling was very tedious, both from the badness of the roads, and\r\nfrom the number of great fallen trees, which it was necessary either to\r\nleap over or to avoid by making long circuits.  We slept on the road,\r\nand next morning reached Valdivia, whence I proceeded on board.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards I crossed the bay with a party of officers, and\r\nlanded near the fort called Niebla.  The buildings were in a most\r\nruinous state, and the gun-carriages quite rotten.  Mr. Wickham\r\nremarked to the commanding officer, that with one discharge they would\r\ncertainly all fall to pieces.  The poor man, trying to put a good face\r\nupon it, gravely replied, \"No, I am sure, sir, they would stand two!\"\r\nThe Spaniards must have intended to have made this place impregnable.\r\nThere is now lying in the middle of the courtyard a little mountain of\r\nmortar, which rivals in hardness the rock on which it is placed.  It\r\nwas brought from Chile, and cost 7000 dollars.  The revolution having\r\nbroken out, prevented its being applied to any purpose, and now it\r\nremains a monument of the fallen greatness of Spain.\r\n\r\nI wanted to go to a house about a mile and a half distant, but my guide\r\nsaid it was quite impossible to penetrate the wood in a straight line.\r\nHe offered, however, to lead me, by following obscure cattle-tracks,\r\nthe shortest way: the walk, nevertheless, took no less than three\r\nhours!  This man is employed in hunting strayed cattle; yet, well as he\r\nmust know the woods, he was not long since lost for two whole days, and\r\nhad nothing to eat.  These facts convey a good idea of the\r\nimpracticability of the forests of these countries. A question often\r\noccurred to me--how long does any vestige of a fallen tree remain? This\r\nman showed me one which a party of fugitive royalists had cut down\r\nfourteen years ago; and taking this as a criterion, I should think a\r\nbole a foot and a half in diameter would in thirty years be changed\r\ninto a heap of mould.\r\n\r\nFebruary 20th.--This day has been memorable in the annals of Valdivia,\r\nfor the most severe earthquake experienced by the oldest inhabitant.  I\r\nhappened to be on shore, and was lying down in the wood to rest myself.\r\nIt came on suddenly, and lasted two minutes, but the time appeared much\r\nlonger.  The rocking of the ground was very sensible. The undulations\r\nappeared to my companion and myself to come from due east, whilst\r\nothers thought they proceeded from south-west: this shows how difficult\r\nit sometimes is to perceive the directions of the vibrations.  There\r\nwas no difficulty in standing upright, but the motion made me almost\r\ngiddy: it was something like the movement of a vessel in a little\r\ncross-ripple, or still more like that felt by a person skating over\r\nthin ice, which bends under the weight of his body. A bad earthquake at\r\nonce destroys our oldest associations: the earth, the very emblem of\r\nsolidity, has moved beneath our feet like a thin crust over a\r\nfluid;--one second of time has created in the mind a strange idea of\r\ninsecurity, which hours of reflection would not have produced.  In the\r\nforest, as a breeze moved the trees, I felt only the earth tremble, but\r\nsaw no other effect.  Captain Fitz Roy and some officers were at the\r\ntown during the shock, and there the scene was more striking; for\r\nalthough the houses, from being built of wood, did not fall, they were\r\nviolently shaken, and the boards creaked and rattled together.  The\r\npeople rushed out of doors in the greatest alarm.  It is these\r\naccompaniments that create that perfect horror of earthquakes,\r\nexperienced by all who have thus seen, as well as felt, their effects.\r\nWithin the forest it was a deeply interesting, but by no means an\r\nawe-exciting phenomenon.  The tides were very curiously affected. The\r\ngreat shock took place at the time of low water; and an old woman who\r\nwas on the beach told me that the water flowed very quickly, but not in\r\ngreat waves, to high-water mark, and then as quickly returned to its\r\nproper level; this was also evident by the line of wet sand.  The same\r\nkind of quick but quiet movement in the tide happened a few years since\r\nat Chiloe, during a slight earthquake, and created much causeless\r\nalarm.  In the course of the evening there were many weaker shocks,\r\nwhich seemed to produce in the harbour the most complicated currents,\r\nand some of great strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 4th.--We entered the harbour of Concepcion.  While the ship was\r\nbeating up to the anchorage, I landed on the island of Quiriquina.  The\r\nmayor-domo of the estate quickly rode down to tell me the terrible news\r\nof the great earthquake of the 20th:--\"That not a house in Concepcion\r\nor Talcahuano (the port) was standing; that seventy villages were\r\ndestroyed; and that a great wave had almost washed away the ruins of\r\nTalcahuano.\" Of this latter statement I soon saw abundant proofs--the\r\nwhole coast being strewed over with timber and furniture as if a\r\nthousand ships had been wrecked.  Besides chairs, tables, book-shelves,\r\netc., in great numbers, there were several roofs of cottages, which had\r\nbeen transported almost whole.  The storehouses at Talcahuano had been\r\nburst open, and great bags of cotton, yerba, and other valuable\r\nmerchandise were scattered on the shore. During my walk round the\r\nisland, I observed that numerous fragments of rock, which, from the\r\nmarine productions adhering to them, must recently have been lying in\r\ndeep water, had been cast up high on the beach; one of these was six\r\nfeet long, three broad, and two thick.\r\n\r\nThe island itself as plainly showed the overwhelming power of the\r\nearthquake, as the beach did that of the consequent great wave.  The\r\nground in many parts was fissured in north and south lines, perhaps\r\ncaused by the yielding of the parallel and steep sides of this narrow\r\nisland.  Some of the fissures near the cliffs were a yard wide.  Many\r\nenormous masses had already fallen on the beach; and the inhabitants\r\nthought that when the rains commenced far greater slips would happen.\r\nThe effect of the vibration on the hard primary slate, which composes\r\nthe foundation of the island, was still more curious: the superficial\r\nparts of some narrow ridges were as completely shivered as if they had\r\nbeen blasted by gunpowder. This effect, which was rendered conspicuous\r\nby the fresh fractures and displaced soil, must be confined to near the\r\nsurface, for otherwise there would not exist a block of solid rock\r\nthroughout Chile; nor is this improbable, as it is known that the\r\nsurface of a vibrating body is affected differently from the central\r\npart.  It is, perhaps, owing to this same reason, that earthquakes do\r\nnot cause quite such terrific havoc within deep mines as would be\r\nexpected.  I believe this convulsion has been more effectual in\r\nlessening the size of the island of Quiriquina, than the ordinary\r\nwear-and-tear of the sea and weather during the course of a whole\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe next day I landed at Talcahuano, and afterwards rode to Concepcion.\r\nBoth towns presented the most awful yet interesting spectacle I ever\r\nbeheld.  To a person who had formerly known them, it possibly might have\r\nbeen still more impressive; for the ruins were so mingled together, and\r\nthe whole scene possessed so little the air of a habitable place, that\r\nit was scarcely possible to imagine its former condition. The\r\nearthquake commenced at half-past eleven o'clock in the forenoon.  If\r\nit had happened in the middle of the night, the greater number of the\r\ninhabitants (which in this one province must amount to many thousands)\r\nmust have perished, instead of less than a hundred: as it was, the\r\ninvariable practice of running out of doors at the first trembling of\r\nthe ground, alone saved them.  In Concepcion each house, or row of\r\nhouses, stood by itself, a heap or line of ruins; but in Talcahuano,\r\nowing to the great wave, little more than one layer of bricks, tiles,\r\nand timber with here and there part of a wall left standing, could be\r\ndistinguished.  From this circumstance Concepcion, although not so\r\ncompletely desolated, was a more terrible, and if I may so call it,\r\npicturesque sight. The first shock was very sudden.  The mayor-domo at\r\nQuiriquina told me, that the first notice he received of it, was\r\nfinding both the horse he rode and himself, rolling together on the\r\nground.  Rising up, he was again thrown down.  He also told me that\r\nsome cows which were standing on the steep side of the island were\r\nrolled into the sea.  The great wave caused the destruction of many\r\ncattle; on one low island near the head of the bay, seventy animals\r\nwere washed off and drowned.  It is generally thought that this has\r\nbeen the worst earthquake ever recorded in Chile; but as the very\r\nsevere ones occur only after long intervals, this cannot easily be\r\nknown; nor indeed would a much worse shock have made any difference,\r\nfor the ruin was now complete.  Innumerable small tremblings followed\r\nthe great earthquake, and within the first twelve days no less than\r\nthree hundred were counted.\r\n\r\nAfter viewing Concepcion, I cannot understand how the greater number of\r\ninhabitants escaped unhurt.  The houses in many parts fell outwards;\r\nthus forming in the middle of the streets little hillocks of brickwork\r\nand rubbish.  Mr. Rouse, the English consul, told us that he was at\r\nbreakfast when the first movement warned him to run out.  He had\r\nscarcely reached the middle of the courtyard, when one side of his\r\nhouse came thundering down.  He retained presence of mind to remember,\r\nthat if he once got on the top of that part which had already fallen,\r\nhe would be safe.  Not being able from the motion of the ground to\r\nstand, he crawled up on his hands and knees; and no sooner had he\r\nascended this little eminence, than the other side of the house fell\r\nin, the great beams sweeping close in front of his head.  With his eyes\r\nblinded, and his mouth choked with the cloud of dust which darkened the\r\nsky, at last he gained the street.  As shock succeeded shock, at the\r\ninterval of a few minutes, no one dared approach the shattered ruins,\r\nand no one knew whether his dearest friends and relations were not\r\nperishing from the want of help.  Those who had saved any property were\r\nobliged to keep a constant watch, for thieves prowled about, and at\r\neach little trembling of the ground, with one hand they beat their\r\nbreasts and cried \"Misericordia!\" and then with the other filched what\r\nthey could from the ruins.  The thatched roofs fell over the fires, and\r\nflames burst forth in all parts.  Hundreds knew themselves ruined, and\r\nfew had the means of providing food for the day.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes alone are sufficient to destroy the prosperity of any\r\ncountry.  If beneath England the now inert subterranean forces should\r\nexert those powers, which most assuredly in former geological ages they\r\nhave exerted, how completely would the entire condition of the country\r\nbe changed! What would become of the lofty houses, thickly packed\r\ncities, great manufactories, the beautiful public and private edifices?\r\nIf the new period of disturbance were first to commence by some great\r\nearthquake in the dead of the night, how terrific would be the carnage!\r\nEngland would at once be bankrupt; all papers, records, and accounts\r\nwould from that moment be lost.  Government being unable to collect the\r\ntaxes, and failing to maintain its authority, the hand of violence and\r\nrapine would remain uncontrolled.  In every large town famine would go\r\nforth, pestilence and death following in its train.\r\n\r\nShortly after the shock, a great wave was seen from the distance of\r\nthree or four miles, approaching in the middle of the bay with a smooth\r\noutline; but along the shore it tore up cottages and trees, as it swept\r\nonwards with irresistible force.  At the head of the bay it broke in a\r\nfearful line of white breakers, which rushed up to a height of 23\r\nvertical feet above the highest spring-tides.  Their force must have\r\nbeen prodigious; for at the Fort a cannon with its carriage, estimated\r\nat four tons in weight, was moved 15 feet inwards. A schooner was left\r\nin the midst of the ruins, 200 yards from the beach.  The first wave\r\nwas followed by two others, which in their retreat carried away a vast\r\nwreck of floating objects.  In one part of the bay, a ship was pitched\r\nhigh and dry on shore, was carried off, again driven on shore, and\r\nagain carried off.  In another part, two large vessels anchored near\r\ntogether were whirled about, and their cables were thrice wound round\r\neach other; though anchored at a depth of 36 feet, they were for some\r\nminutes aground.  The great wave must have travelled slowly, for the\r\ninhabitants of Talcahuano had time to run up the hills behind the town;\r\nand some sailors pulled out seaward, trusting successfully to their\r\nboat riding securely over the swell, if they could reach it before it\r\nbroke.  One old woman with a little boy, four or five years old, ran\r\ninto a boat, but there was nobody to row it out: the boat was\r\nconsequently dashed against an anchor and cut in twain; the old woman\r\nwas drowned, but the child was picked up some hours afterwards clinging\r\nto the wreck. Pools of salt-water were still standing amidst the ruins\r\nof the houses, and children, making boats with old tables and chairs,\r\nappeared as happy as their parents were miserable. It was, however,\r\nexceedingly interesting to observe, how much more active and cheerful\r\nall appeared than could have been expected.  It was remarked with much\r\ntruth, that from the destruction being universal, no one individual was\r\nhumbled more than another, or could suspect his friends of\r\ncoldness--that most grievous result of the loss of wealth.  Mr. Rouse,\r\nand a large party whom he kindly took under his protection, lived for\r\nthe first week in a garden beneath some apple-trees. At first they were\r\nas merry as if it had been a picnic; but soon afterwards heavy rain\r\ncaused much discomfort, for they were absolutely without shelter.\r\n\r\nIn Captain Fitz Roy's excellent account of the earthquake, it is said\r\nthat two explosions, one like a column of smoke and another like the\r\nblowing of a great whale, were seen in the bay.  The water also\r\nappeared everywhere to be boiling; and it \"became black, and exhaled a\r\nmost disagreeable sulphureous smell.\" These latter circumstances were\r\nobserved in the Bay of Valparaiso during the earthquake of 1822; they\r\nmay, I think, be accounted for, by the disturbance of the mud at the\r\nbottom of the sea containing organic matter in decay.  In the Bay of\r\nCallao, during a calm day, I noticed, that as the ship dragged her\r\ncable over the bottom, its course was marked by a line of bubbles.  The\r\nlower orders in Talcahuano thought that the earthquake was caused by\r\nsome old Indian women, who two years ago, being offended, stopped the\r\nvolcano of Antuco.  This silly belief is curious, because it shows that\r\nexperience has taught them to observe, that there exists a relation\r\nbetween the suppressed action of the volcanos, and the trembling of the\r\nground.  It was necessary to apply the witchcraft to the point where\r\ntheir perception of cause and effect failed; and this was the closing\r\nof the volcanic vent. This belief is the more singular in this\r\nparticular instance, because, according to Captain Fitz Roy, there is\r\nreason to believe that Antuco was noways affected.\r\n\r\nThe town of Concepcion was built in the usual Spanish fashion, with all\r\nthe streets running at right angles to each other; one set ranging S.W.\r\nby W., and the other set N.W. by N.  The walls in the former direction\r\ncertainly stood better than those in the latter; the greater number of\r\nthe masses of brickwork were thrown down towards the N.E. Both these\r\ncircumstances perfectly agree with the general idea, of the undulations\r\nhaving come from the S.W., in which quarter subterranean noises were\r\nalso heard; for it is evident that the walls running S.W. and N.E.\r\nwhich presented their ends to the point whence the undulations came,\r\nwould be much less likely to fall than those walls which, running N.W.\r\nand S.E., must in their whole lengths have been at the same instant\r\nthrown out of the perpendicular; for the undulations, coming from the\r\nS.W., must have extended in N.W. and S.E. waves, as they passed under\r\nthe foundations.  This may be illustrated by placing books edgeways on\r\na carpet, and then, after the manner suggested by Michell, imitating\r\nthe undulations of an earthquake: it will be found that they fall with\r\nmore or less readiness, according as their direction more or less\r\nnearly coincides with the line of the waves.  The fissures in the\r\nground generally, though not uniformly, extended in a S.E. and N.W.\r\ndirection, and therefore corresponded to the lines of undulation or of\r\nprincipal flexure.  Bearing in mind all these circumstances, which so\r\nclearly point to the S.W. as the chief focus of disturbance, it is a\r\nvery interesting fact that the island of S. Maria, situated in that\r\nquarter, was, during the general uplifting of the land, raised to\r\nnearly three times the height of any other part of the coast.\r\n\r\nThe different resistance offered by the walls, according to their\r\ndirection, was well exemplified in the case of the Cathedral.  The side\r\nwhich fronted the N.E. presented a grand pile of ruins, in the midst of\r\nwhich door-cases and masses of timber stood up, as if floating in a\r\nstream.  Some of the angular blocks of brickwork were of great\r\ndimensions; and they were rolled to a distance on the level plaza, like\r\nfragments of rock at the base of some high mountain.  The side walls\r\n(running S.W. and N.E.), though exceedingly fractured, yet remained\r\nstanding; but the vast buttresses (at right angles to them, and\r\ntherefore parallel to the walls that fell) were in many cases cut clean\r\noff, as if by a chisel, and hurled to the ground.  Some square\r\nornaments on the coping of these same walls, were moved by the\r\nearthquake into a diagonal position.  A similar circumstance was\r\nobserved after an earthquake at Valparaiso, Calabria, and other places,\r\nincluding some of the ancient Greek temples. [1] This twisting\r\ndisplacement, at first appears to indicate a vorticose movement beneath\r\neach point thus affected; but this is highly improbable.  May it not be\r\ncaused by a tendency in each stone to arrange itself in some particular\r\nposition, with respect to the lines of vibration,--in a manner somewhat\r\nsimilar to pins on a sheet of paper when shaken?  Generally speaking,\r\narched doorways or windows stood much better than any other part of the\r\nbuildings.  Nevertheless, a poor lame old man, who had been in the\r\nhabit, during trifling shocks, of crawling to a certain doorway, was\r\nthis time crushed to pieces.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to give any detailed description of the appearance\r\nof Concepcion, for I feel that it is quite impossible to convey the\r\nmingled feelings which I experienced. Several of the officers visited\r\nit before me, but their strongest language failed to give a just idea\r\nof the scene of desolation.  It is a bitter and humiliating thing to\r\nsee works, which have cost man so much time and labour, overthrown in\r\none minute; yet compassion for the inhabitants was almost instantly\r\nbanished, by the surprise in seeing a state of things produced in a\r\nmoment of time, which one was accustomed to attribute to a succession\r\nof ages.  In my opinion, we have scarcely beheld, since leaving\r\nEngland, any sight so deeply interesting.\r\n\r\nIn almost every severe earthquake, the neighbouring waters of the sea\r\nare said to have been greatly agitated.  The disturbance seems\r\ngenerally, as in the case of Concepcion, to have been of two kinds:\r\nfirst, at the instant of the shock, the water swells high up on the\r\nbeach with a gentle motion, and then as quietly retreats; secondly,\r\nsome time afterwards, the whole body of the sea retires from the coast,\r\nand then returns in waves of overwhelming force.  The first movement\r\nseems to be an immediate consequence of the earthquake affecting\r\ndifferently a fluid and a solid, so that their respective levels are\r\nslightly deranged: but the second case is a far more important\r\nphenomenon.  During most earthquakes, and especially during those on\r\nthe west coast of America, it is certain that the first great movement\r\nof the waters has been a retirement.  Some authors have attempted to\r\nexplain this, by supposing that the water retains its level, whilst the\r\nland oscillates upwards; but surely the water close to the land, even\r\non a rather steep coast, would partake of the motion of the bottom:\r\nmoreover, as urged by Mr. Lyell, similar movements of the sea have\r\noccurred at islands far distant from the chief line of disturbance, as\r\nwas the case with Juan Fernandez during this earthquake, and with\r\nMadeira during the famous Lisbon shock.  I suspect (but the subject is\r\na very obscure one) that a wave, however produced, first draws the\r\nwater from the shore, on which it is advancing to break: I have\r\nobserved that this happens with the little waves from the paddles of a\r\nsteam-boat.  It is remarkable that whilst Talcahuano and Callao (near\r\nLima), both situated at the head of large shallow bays, have suffered\r\nduring every severe earthquake from great waves, Valparaiso, seated\r\nclose to the edge of profoundly deep water, has never been overwhelmed,\r\nthough so often shaken by the severest shocks.  From the great wave not\r\nimmediately following the earthquake, but sometimes after the interval\r\nof even half an hour, and from distant islands being affected similarly\r\nwith the coasts near the focus of the disturbance, it appears that the\r\nwave first rises in the offing; and as this is of general occurrence,\r\nthe cause must be general: I suspect we must look to the line, where\r\nthe less disturbed waters of the deep ocean join the water nearer the\r\ncoast, which has partaken of the movements of the land, as the place\r\nwhere the great wave is first generated; it would also appear that the\r\nwave is larger or smaller, according to the extent of shoal water which\r\nhas been agitated together with the bottom on which it rested.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable effect of this earthquake was the permanent\r\nelevation of the land, it would probably be far more correct to speak\r\nof it as the cause.  There can be no doubt that the land round the Bay\r\nof Concepcion was upraised two or three feet; but it deserves notice,\r\nthat owing to the wave having obliterated the old lines of tidal action\r\non the sloping sandy shores, I could discover no evidence of this fact,\r\nexcept in the united testimony of the inhabitants, that one little\r\nrocky shoal, now exposed, was formerly covered with water.  At the\r\nisland of S. Maria (about thirty miles distant) the elevation was\r\ngreater; on one part, Captain Fitz Roy founds beds of putrid\r\nmussel-shells _still adhering to the rocks_, ten feet above high-water\r\nmark: the inhabitants had formerly dived at lower-water spring-tides\r\nfor these shells. The elevation of this province is particularly\r\ninteresting, from its having been the theatre of several other violent\r\nearthquakes, and from the vast numbers of sea-shells scattered over the\r\nland, up to a height of certainly 600, and I believe, of 1000 feet.  At\r\nValparaiso, as I have remarked, similar shells are found at the height\r\nof 1300 feet: it is hardly possible to doubt that this great elevation\r\nhas been effected by successive small uprisings, such as that which\r\naccompanied or caused the earthquake of this year, and likewise by an\r\ninsensibly slow rise, which is certainly in progress on some parts of\r\nthis coast.\r\n\r\nThe island of Juan Fernandez, 360 miles to the N.E., was, at the time\r\nof the great shock of the 20th, violently shaken, so that the trees\r\nbeat against each other, and a volcano burst forth under water close to\r\nthe shore: these facts are remarkable because this island, during the\r\nearthquake of 1751, was then also affected more violently than other\r\nplaces at an equal distance from Concepcion, and this seems to show\r\nsome subterranean connection between these two points.  Chiloe, about\r\n340 miles southward of Concepcion, appears to have been shaken more\r\nstrongly than the intermediate district of Valdivia, where the volcano\r\nof Villarica was noways affected, whilst in the Cordillera in front of\r\nChiloe, two of the volcanos burst-forth at the same instant in violent\r\naction.  These two volcanos, and some neighbouring ones, continued for\r\na long time in eruption, and ten months afterwards were again\r\ninfluenced by an earthquake at Concepcion.  Some men, cutting wood near\r\nthe base of one of these volcanos, did not perceive the shock of the\r\n20th, although the whole surrounding Province was then trembling; here\r\nwe have an eruption relieving and taking the place of an earthquake, as\r\nwould have happened at Concepcion, according to the belief of the lower\r\norders, if the volcano at Antuco had not been closed by witchcraft. Two\r\nyears and three-quarters afterwards, Valdivia and Chiloe were again\r\nshaken, more violently than on the 20th, and an island in the Chonos\r\nArchipelago was permanently elevated more than eight feet. It will give\r\na better idea of the scale of these phenomena, if (as in the case of\r\nthe glaciers) we suppose them to have taken place at corresponding\r\ndistances in Europe:--then would the land from the North Sea to the\r\nMediterranean have been violently shaken, and at the same instant of\r\ntime a large tract of the eastern coast of England would have been\r\npermanently elevated, together with some outlying islands,--a train of\r\nvolcanos on the coast of Holland would have burst forth in action, and\r\nan eruption taken place at the bottom of the sea, near the northern\r\nextremity of Ireland--and lastly, the ancient vents of Auvergne,\r\nCantal, and Mont d'Or would each have sent up to the sky a dark column\r\nof smoke, and have long remained in fierce action.  Two years and\r\nthree-quarters afterwards, France, from its centre to the English\r\nChannel, would have been again desolated by an earthquake and an island\r\npermanently upraised in the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe space, from under which volcanic matter on the 20th was actually\r\nerupted, is 720 miles in one line, and 400 miles in another line at\r\nright angles to the first: hence, in all probability, a subterranean\r\nlake of lava is here stretched out, of nearly double the area of the\r\nBlack Sea.  From the intimate and complicated manner in which the\r\nelevatory and eruptive forces were shown to be connected during this\r\ntrain of phenomena, we may confidently come to the conclusion, that the\r\nforces which slowly and by little starts uplift continents, and those\r\nwhich at successive periods pour forth volcanic matter from open\r\norifices, are identical.  From many reasons, I believe that the\r\nfrequent quakings of the earth on this line of coast are caused by the\r\nrending of the strata, necessarily consequent on the tension of the\r\nland when upraised, and their injection by fluidified rock.  This\r\nrending and injection would, if repeated often enough (and we know that\r\nearthquakes repeatedly affect the same areas in the same manner), form\r\na chain of hills;--and the linear island of S. Mary, which was upraised\r\nthrice the height of the neighbouring country, seems to be undergoing\r\nthis process.  I believe that the solid axis of a mountain, differs in\r\nits manner of formation from a volcanic hill, only in the molten stone\r\nhaving been repeatedly injected, instead of having been repeatedly\r\nejected.  Moreover, I believe that it is impossible to explain the\r\nstructure of great mountain-chains, such as that of the Cordillera,\r\nwere the strata, capping the injected axis of plutonic rock, have been\r\nthrown on their edges along several parallel and neighbouring lines of\r\nelevation, except on this view of the rock of the axis having been\r\nrepeatedly injected, after intervals sufficiently long to allow the\r\nupper parts or wedges to cool and become solid;--for if the strata had\r\nbeen thrown into their present highly inclined, vertical, and even\r\ninverted positions, by a single blow, the very bowels of the earth\r\nwould have gushed out; and instead of beholding abrupt mountain-axes of\r\nrock solidified under great pressure, deluges of lava would have flowed\r\nout at innumerable points on every line of elevation.

The wind being northerly, we only reached the mouth of\r\nthe harbour of Concepcion before it was dark.  Being very near the\r\nland, and a fog coming on, the anchor was dropped. Presently a large\r\nAmerican whaler appeared alongside of us; and we heard the Yankee\r\nswearing at his men to keep quiet, whilst he listened for the breakers.\r\nCaptain Fitz Roy hailed him, in a loud clear voice, to anchor where he\r\nthen was.  The poor man must have thought the voice came from the\r\nshore: such a Babel of cries issued at once from the ship--every one\r\nhallooing out, \"Let go the anchor! veer cable! shorten sail!\" It was\r\nthe most laughable thing I ever heard.  If the ship's crew had been all\r\ncaptains, and no men, there could not have been a greater uproar of\r\norders.  We afterwards found that the mate stuttered: I suppose all\r\nhands were assisting him in giving his orders.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th we anchored at Valparaiso, and two days afterwards I set\r\nout to cross the Cordillera.  I proceeded to Santiago, where Mr.\r\nCaldcleugh most kindly assisted me in every possible way in making the\r\nlittle preparations which were necessary.  In this part of Chile there\r\nare two passes across the Andes to Mendoza: the one most commonly used,\r\nnamely, that of Aconcagua or Uspallata--is situated some way to the\r\nnorth; the other, called the Portillo, is to the south, and nearer, but\r\nmore lofty and dangerous.\r\n\r\nMarch 18th.--We set out for the Portillo pass.  Leaving Santiago we\r\ncrossed the wide burnt-up plain on which that city stands, and in the\r\nafternoon arrived at the Maypu, one of the principal rivers in Chile.\r\nThe valley, at the point where it enters the first Cordillera, is\r\nbounded on each side by lofty barren mountains; and although not broad,\r\nit is very fertile.  Numerous cottages were surrounded by vines, and by\r\norchards of apple, nectarine, and peach-trees--their boughs breaking\r\nwith the weight of the beautiful ripe fruit.  In the evening we passed\r\nthe custom-house, where our luggage was examined.  The frontier of\r\nChile is better guarded by the Cordillera, than by the waters of the\r\nsea.  There are very few valleys which lead to the central ranges, and\r\nthe mountains are quite impassable in other parts by beasts of burden.\r\nThe custom-house officers were very civil, which was perhaps partly\r\nowing to the passport which the President of the Republic had given me;\r\nbut I must express my admiration at the natural politeness of almost\r\nevery Chileno.  In this instance, the contrast with the same class of\r\nmen in most other countries was strongly marked.  I may mention an\r\nanecdote with which I was at the time much pleased: we met near Mendoza\r\na little and very fat negress, riding astride on a mule.  She had a\r\n_goitre_ so enormous that it was scarcely possible to avoid gazing at\r\nher for a moment; but my two companions almost instantly, by way of\r\napology, made the common salute of the country by taking off their\r\nhats.  Where would one of the lower or higher classes in Europe, have\r\nshown such feeling politeness to a poor and miserable object of a\r\ndegraded race?\r\n\r\nAt night we slept at a cottage.  Our manner of travelling was\r\ndelightfully independent.  In the inhabited parts we bought a little\r\nfirewood, hired pasture for the animals, and bivouacked in the corner\r\nof the same field with them.  Carrying an iron pot, we cooked and ate\r\nour supper under a cloudless sky, and knew no trouble.  My companions\r\nwere Mariano Gonzales, who had formerly accompanied me in Chile, and an\r\n\"arriero,\" with his ten mules and a \"madrina.\" The madrina (or\r\ngodmother) is a most important personage:\r\n\r\nShe is an old steady mare, with a little bell round her neck; and\r\nwherever she goes, the mules, like good children, follow her.  The\r\naffection of these animals for their madrinas saves infinite trouble.\r\nIf several large troops are turned into one field to graze, in the\r\nmorning the muleteers have only to lead the madrinas a little apart,\r\nand tinkle their bells; although there may be two or three hundred\r\ntogether, each mule immediately knows the bell of its own madrina, and\r\ncomes to her.  It is nearly impossible to lose an old mule; for if\r\ndetained for several hours by force, she will, by the power of smell,\r\nlike a dog, track out her companions, or rather the madrina, for,\r\naccording to the muleteer, she is the chief object of affection.  The\r\nfeeling, however, is not of an individual nature; for I believe I am\r\nright in saying that any animal with a bell will serve as a madrina. In\r\na troop each animal carries on a level road, a cargo weighing 416\r\npounds (more than 29 stone), but in a mountainous country 100 pounds\r\nless; yet with what delicate slim limbs, without any proportional bulk\r\nof muscle, these animals support so great a burden!  The mule always\r\nappears to me a most surprising animal.  That a hybrid should possess\r\nmore reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular\r\nendurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to\r\nindicate that art has here outdone nature.  Of our ten animals, six\r\nwere intended for riding, and four for carrying cargoes, each taking\r\nturn about.  We carried a good deal of food in case we should be snowed\r\nup, as the season was rather late for passing the Portillo.\r\n\r\nMarch 19th.--We rode during this day to the last, and therefore most\r\nelevated, house in the valley.  The number of inhabitants became\r\nscanty; but wherever water could be brought on the land, it was very\r\nfertile.  All the main valleys in the Cordillera are characterized by\r\nhaving, on both sides, a fringe or terrace of shingle and sand, rudely\r\nstratified, and generally of considerable thickness.  These fringes\r\nevidently once extended across the valleys and were united; and the\r\nbottoms of the valleys in northern Chile, where there are no streams,\r\nare thus smoothly filled up.  On these fringes the roads are generally\r\ncarried, for their surfaces are even, and they rise, with a very gentle\r\nslope up the valleys: hence, also, they are easily cultivated by\r\nirrigation.  They may be traced up to a height of between 7000 and 9000\r\nfeet, where they become hidden by the irregular piles of debris.  At\r\nthe lower end or mouths of the valleys, they are continuously united to\r\nthose land-locked plains (also formed of shingle) at the foot of the\r\nmain Cordillera, which I have described in a former chapter as\r\ncharacteristic of the scenery of Chile, and which were undoubtedly\r\ndeposited when the sea penetrated Chile, as it now does the more\r\nsouthern coasts.  No one fact in the geology of South America,\r\ninterested me more than these terraces of rudely-stratified shingle.\r\nThey precisely resemble in composition the matter which the torrents in\r\neach valley would deposit, if they were checked in their course by any\r\ncause, such as entering a lake or arm of the sea; but the torrents,\r\ninstead of depositing matter, are now steadily at work wearing away\r\nboth the solid rock and these alluvial deposits, along the whole line\r\nof every main valley and side valley.  It is impossible here to give\r\nthe reasons, but I am convinced that the shingle terraces were\r\naccumulated, during the gradual elevation of the Cordillera, by the\r\ntorrents delivering, at successive levels, their detritus on the\r\nbeachheads of long narrow arms of the sea, first high up the valleys,\r\nthen lower and lower down as the land slowly rose.  If this be so, and\r\nI cannot doubt it, the grand and broken chain of the Cordillera,\r\ninstead of having been suddenly thrown up, as was till lately the\r\nuniversal, and still is the common opinion of geologists, has been\r\nslowly upheaved in mass, in the same gradual manner as the coasts of\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific have risen within the recent period.  A\r\nmultitude of facts in the structure of the Cordillera, on this view\r\nreceive a simple explanation.\r\n\r\nThe rivers which flow in these valleys ought rather to be called\r\nmountain-torrents.  Their inclination is very great, and their water\r\nthe colour of mud.  The roar which the Maypu made, as it rushed over\r\nthe great rounded fragments, was like that of the sea.  Amidst the din\r\nof rushing waters, the noise from the stones, as they rattled one over\r\nanother, was most distinctly audible even from a distance.  This\r\nrattling noise, night and day, may be heard along the whole course of\r\nthe torrent.  The sound spoke eloquently to the geologist; the\r\nthousands and thousands of stones, which, striking against each other,\r\nmade the one dull uniform sound, were all hurrying in one direction. It\r\nwas like thinking on time, where the minute that now glides past is\r\nirrevocable. So was it with these stones; the ocean is their eternity,\r\nand each note of that wild music told of one more step towards their\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for the mind to comprehend, except by a slow\r\nprocess, any effect which is produced by a cause repeated so often,\r\nthat the multiplier itself conveys an idea, not more definite than the\r\nsavage implies when he points to the hairs of his head.  As often as I\r\nhave seen beds of mud, sand, and shingle, accumulated to the thickness\r\nof many thousand feet, I have felt inclined to exclaim that causes,\r\nsuch as the present rivers and the present beaches, could never have\r\nground down and produced such masses.  But, on the other hand, when\r\nlistening to the rattling noise of these torrents, and calling to mind\r\nthat whole races of animals have passed away from the face of the\r\nearth, and that during this whole period, night and day, these stones\r\nhave gone rattling onwards in their course, I have thought to myself,\r\ncan any mountains, any continent, withstand such waste?\r\n\r\nIn this part of the valley, the mountains on each side were from 3000\r\nto 6000 or 8000 feet high, with rounded outlines and steep bare flanks.\r\nThe general colour of the rock was dullish purple, and the\r\nstratification very distinct.  If the scenery was not beautiful, it was\r\nremarkable and grand.  We met during the day several herds of cattle,\r\nwhich men were driving down from the higher valleys in the Cordillera.\r\nThis sign of the approaching winter hurried our steps, more than was\r\nconvenient for geologizing.  The house where we slept was situated at\r\nthe foot of a mountain, on the summit of which are the mines of S.\r\nPedro de Nolasko.  Sir F. Head marvels how mines have been discovered\r\nin such extraordinary situations, as the bleak summit of the mountain\r\nof S. Pedro de Nolasko.  In the first place, metallic veins in this\r\ncountry are generally harder than the surrounding strata: hence, during\r\nthe gradual wear of the hills, they project above the surface of the\r\nground.  Secondly, almost every labourer, especially in the northern\r\nparts of Chile, understands something about the appearance of ores.  In\r\nthe great mining provinces of Coquimbo and Copiapo, firewood is very\r\nscarce, and men search for it over every hill and dale; and by this\r\nmeans nearly all the richest mines have there been discovered.\r\nChanuncillo, from which silver to the value of many hundred thousand\r\npounds has been raised in the course of a few years, was discovered by\r\na man who threw a stone at his loaded donkey, and thinking that it was\r\nvery heavy, he picked it up, and found it full of pure silver: the vein\r\noccurred at no great distance, standing up like a wedge of metal.  The\r\nminers, also, taking a crowbar with them, often wander on Sundays over\r\nthe mountains.  In this south part of Chile, the men who drive cattle\r\ninto the Cordillera, and who frequent every ravine where there is a\r\nlittle pasture, are the usual discoverers.\r\n\r\n20th.--As we ascended the valley, the vegetation, with the exception of\r\na few pretty alpine flowers, became exceedingly scanty, and of\r\nquadrupeds, birds, or insects, scarcely one could be seen.  The lofty\r\nmountains, their summits marked with a few patches of snow, stood well\r\nseparated from each other, the valleys being filled up with an immense\r\nthickness of stratified alluvium.  The features in the scenery of the\r\nAndes which struck me most, as contrasted with the other mountain\r\nchains with which I am acquainted, were,--the flat fringes sometimes\r\nexpanding into narrow plains on each side of the valleys,--the bright\r\ncolours, chiefly red and purple, of the utterly bare and precipitous\r\nhills of porphyry, the grand and continuous wall-like dykes,--the\r\nplainly-divided strata which, where nearly vertical, formed the\r\npicturesque and wild central pinnacles, but where less inclined,\r\ncomposed the great massive mountains on the outskirts of the\r\nrange,--and lastly, the smooth conical piles of fine and brightly\r\ncoloured detritus, which sloped up at a high angle from the base of the\r\nmountains, sometimes to a height of more than 2000 feet.\r\n\r\nI frequently observed, both in Tierra del Fuego and within the Andes,\r\nthat where the rock was covered during the greater part of the year\r\nwith snow, it was shivered in a very extraordinary manner into small\r\nangular fragments.  Scoresby [1] has observed the same fact in\r\nSpitzbergen.  The case appears to me rather obscure: for that part of\r\nthe mountain which is protected by a mantle of snow, must be less\r\nsubject to repeated and great changes of temperature than any other\r\npart.  I have sometimes thought, that the earth and fragments of stone\r\non the surface, were perhaps less effectually removed by slowly\r\npercolating snow-water [2] than by rain, and therefore that the\r\nappearance of a quicker disintegration of the solid rock under the\r\nsnow, was deceptive.  Whatever the cause may be, the quantity of\r\ncrumbling stone on the Cordillera is very great.  Occasionally in the\r\nspring, great masses of this detritus slide down the mountains, and\r\ncover the snow-drifts in the valleys, thus forming natural ice-houses.\r\nWe rode over one, the height of which was far below the limit of\r\nperpetual snow.\r\n\r\nAs the evening drew to a close, we reached a singular basin-like plain,\r\ncalled the Valle del Yeso.  It was covered by a little dry pasture, and\r\nwe had the pleasant sight of a herd of cattle amidst the surrounding\r\nrocky deserts.  The valley takes its name of Yeso from a great bed, I\r\nshould think at least 2000 feet thick, of white, and in some parts\r\nquite pure, gypsum.  We slept with a party of men, who were employed in\r\nloading mules with this substance, which is used in the manufacture of\r\nwine.  We set out early in the morning (21st), and continued to follow\r\nthe course of the river, which had become very small, till we arrived\r\nat the foot of the ridge, that separates the waters flowing into the\r\nPacific and Atlantic Oceans.  The road, which as yet had been good with\r\na steady but very gradual ascent, now changed into a steep zigzag track\r\nup the great range, dividing the republics of Chile and Mendoza.\r\n\r\nI will here give a very brief sketch of the geology of the several\r\nparallel lines forming the Cordillera.  Of these lines, there are two\r\nconsiderably higher than the others; namely, on the Chilian side, the\r\nPeuquenes ridge, which, where the road crosses it, is 13,210 feet above\r\nthe sea; and the Portillo ridge, on the Mendoza side, which is 14,305\r\nfeet.  The lower beds of the Peuquenes ridge, and of the several great\r\nlines to the westward of it, are composed of a vast pile, many thousand\r\nfeet in thickness, of porphyries which have flowed as submarine lavas,\r\nalternating with angular and rounded fragments of the same rocks,\r\nthrown out of the submarine craters. These alternating masses are\r\ncovered in the central parts, by a great thickness of red sandstone,\r\nconglomerate, and calcareous clay-slate, associated with, and passing\r\ninto, prodigious beds of gypsum.  In these upper beds shells are\r\ntolerably frequent; and they belong to about the period of the lower\r\nchalk of Europe.  It is an old story, but not the less wonderful, to\r\nhear of shells which were once crawling on the bottom of the sea, now\r\nstanding nearly 14,000 feet above its level.  The lower beds in this\r\ngreat pile of strata, have been dislocated, baked, crystallized and\r\nalmost blended together, through the agency of mountain masses of a\r\npeculiar white soda-granitic rock.\r\n\r\nThe other main line, namely, that of the Portillo, is of a totally\r\ndifferent formation: it consists chiefly of grand bare pinnacles of a\r\nred potash-granite, which low down on the western flank are covered by\r\na sandstone, converted by the former heat into a quartz-rock.  On the\r\nquartz, there rest beds of a conglomerate several thousand feet in\r\nthickness, which have been upheaved by the red granite, and dip at an\r\nangle of 45 degs. towards the Peuquenes line.  I was astonished to find\r\nthat this conglomerate was partly composed of pebbles, derived from the\r\nrocks, with their fossil shells, of the Peuquenes range; and partly of\r\nred potash-granite, like that of the Portillo.  Hence we must conclude,\r\nthat both the Peuquenes and Portillo ranges were partially upheaved and\r\nexposed to wear and tear, when the conglomerate was forming; but as the\r\nbeds of the conglomerate have been thrown off at an angle of 45 degs.\r\nby the red Portillo granite (with the underlying sandstone baked by\r\nit), we may feel sure, that the greater part of the injection and\r\nupheaval of the already partially formed Portillo line, took place\r\nafter the accumulation of the conglomerate, and long after the\r\nelevation of the Peuquenes ridge.  So that the Portillo, the loftiest\r\nline in this part of the Cordillera, is not so old as the less lofty\r\nline of the Peuquenes.  Evidence derived from an inclined stream of\r\nlava at the eastern base of the Portillo, might be adduced to show,\r\nthat it owes part of its great height to elevations of a still later\r\ndate.  Looking to its earliest origin, the red granite seems to have\r\nbeen injected on an ancient pre-existing line of white granite and\r\nmica-slate.  In most parts, perhaps in all parts, of the Cordillera, it\r\nmay be concluded that each line has been formed by repeated upheavals\r\nand injections; and that the several parallel lines are of different\r\nages.  Only thus can we gain time, at all sufficient to explain the\r\ntruly astonishing amount of denudation, which these great, though\r\ncomparatively with most other ranges recent, mountains have suffered.\r\n\r\nFinally, the shells in the Peuquenes or oldest ridge, prove, as before\r\nremarked, that it has been upraised 14,000 feet since a Secondary\r\nperiod, which in Europe we are accustomed to consider as far from\r\nancient; but since these shells lived in a moderately deep sea, it can\r\nbe shown that the area now occupied by the Cordillera, must have\r\nsubsided several thousand feet--in northern Chile as much as 6000\r\nfeet--so as to have allowed that amount of submarine strata to have\r\nbeen heaped on the bed on which the shells lived.  The proof is the\r\nsame with that by which it was shown, that at a much later period,\r\nsince the tertiary shells of Patagonia lived, there must have been\r\nthere a subsidence of several hundred feet, as well as an ensuing\r\nelevation.  Daily it is forced home on the mind of the geologist, that\r\nnothing, not even the wind that blows, is so unstable as the level of\r\nthe crust of this earth.\r\n\r\nI will make only one other geological remark: although the Portillo\r\nchain is here higher than the Peuquenes, the waters draining the\r\nintermediate valleys, have burst through it.  The same fact, on a\r\ngrander scale, has been remarked in the eastern and loftiest line of\r\nthe Bolivian Cordillera, through which the rivers pass: analogous facts\r\nhave also been observed in other quarters of the world.  On the\r\nsupposition of the subsequent and gradual elevation of the Portillo\r\nline, this can be understood; for a chain of islets would at first\r\nappear, and, as these were lifted up, the tides would be always wearing\r\ndeeper and broader channels between them. At the present day, even in\r\nthe most retired Sounds on the coast of Tierra del Fuego, the currents\r\nin the transverse breaks which connect the longitudinal channels, are\r\nvery strong, so that in one transverse channel even a small vessel\r\nunder sail was whirled round and round.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout noon we began the tedious ascent of the Peuquenes ridge, and then\r\nfor the first time experienced some little difficulty in our\r\nrespiration.  The mules would halt every fifty yards, and after resting\r\nfor a few seconds the poor willing animals started of their own accord\r\nagain.  The short breathing from the rarefied atmosphere is called by\r\nthe Chilenos \"puna;\" and they have most ridiculous notions concerning\r\nits origin.  Some say \"all the waters here have puna;\" others that\r\n\"where there is snow there is puna;\"--and this no doubt is true.  The\r\nonly sensation I experienced was a slight tightness across the head and\r\nchest, like that felt on leaving a warm room and running quickly in\r\nfrosty weather.  There was some imagination even in this; for upon\r\nfinding fossil shells on the highest ridge, I entirely forgot the puna\r\nin my delight.  Certainly the exertion of walking was extremely great,\r\nand the respiration became deep and laborious: I am told that in Potosi\r\n(about 13,000 feet above the sea) strangers do not become thoroughly\r\naccustomed to the atmosphere for an entire year.  The inhabitants all\r\nrecommend onions for the puna; as this vegetable has sometimes been\r\ngiven in Europe for pectoral complaints, it may possibly be of real\r\nservice:--for my part I found nothing so good as the fossil shells!\r\n\r\nWhen about half-way up we met a large party with seventy loaded mules.\r\nIt was interesting to hear the wild cries of the muleteers, and to\r\nwatch the long descending string of the animals; they appeared so\r\ndiminutive, there being nothing but the black mountains with which they\r\ncould be compared.  When near the summit, the wind, as generally\r\nhappens, was impetuous and extremely cold.  On each side of the ridge,\r\nwe had to pass over broad bands of perpetual snow, which were now soon\r\nto be covered by a fresh layer. When we reached the crest and looked\r\nbackwards, a glorious view was presented.  The atmosphere resplendently\r\nclear; the sky an intense blue; the profound valleys; the wild broken\r\nforms: the heaps of ruins, piled up during the lapse of ages; the\r\nbright-coloured rocks, contrasted with the quiet mountains of snow, all\r\nthese together produced a scene no one could have imagined.  Neither\r\nplant nor bird, excepting a few condors wheeling around the higher\r\npinnacles, distracted my attention from the inanimate mass.  I felt\r\nglad that I was alone: it was like watching a thunderstorm, or hearing\r\nin full orchestra a chorus of the Messiah.\r\n\r\nOn several patches of the snow I found the Protococcus nivalis, or red\r\nsnow, so well known from the accounts of Arctic navigators.  My\r\nattention was called to it, by observing the footsteps of the mules\r\nstained a pale red, as if their hoofs had been slightly bloody.  I at\r\nfirst thought that it was owing to dust blown from the surrounding\r\nmountains of red porphyry; for from the magnifying power of the\r\ncrystals of snow, the groups of these microscopical plants appeared\r\nlike coarse particles.  The snow was coloured only where it had thawed\r\nvery rapidly, or had been accidentally crushed. A little rubbed on\r\npaper gave it a faint rose tinge mingled with a little brick-red.  I\r\nafterwards scraped some off the paper, and found that it consisted of\r\ngroups of little spheres in colourless cases, each of the thousandth\r\npart of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe wind on the crest of the Peuquenes, as just remarked, is generally\r\nimpetuous and very cold: it is said [3] to blow steadily from the\r\nwestward or Pacific side.  As the observations have been chiefly made\r\nin summer, this wind must be an upper and return current.  The Peak of\r\nTeneriffe, with a less elevation, and situated in lat. 28 degs., in\r\nlike manner falls within an upper return stream.  At first it appears\r\nrather surprising, that the trade-wind along the northern parts of\r\nChile and on the coast of Peru, should blow in so very southerly a\r\ndirection as it does; but when we reflect that the Cordillera, running\r\nin a north and south line, intercepts, like a great wall, the entire\r\ndepth of the lower atmospheric current, we can easily see that the\r\ntrade-wind must be drawn northward, following the line of mountains,\r\ntowards the equatorial regions, and thus lose part of that easterly\r\nmovement which it otherwise would have gained from the earth's\r\nrotation.  At Mendoza, on the eastern foot of the Andes, the climate is\r\nsaid to be subject to long calms, and to frequent though false\r\nappearances of gathering rain-storms: we may imagine that the wind,\r\nwhich coming from the eastward is thus banked up by the line of\r\nmountains, would become stagnant and irregular in its movements.\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the Peuquenes, we descended into a mountainous country,\r\nintermediate between the two main ranges, and then took up our quarters\r\nfor the night.  We were now in the republic of Mendoza.  The elevation\r\nwas probably not under 11,000 feet, and the vegetation in consequence\r\nexceedingly scanty.  The root of a small scrubby plant served as fuel,\r\nbut it made a miserable fire, and the wind was piercingly cold.  Being\r\nquite tired with my days work, I made up my bed as quickly as I could,\r\nand went to sleep. About midnight I observed the sky became suddenly\r\nclouded: I awakened the arriero to know if there was any danger of bad\r\nweather; but he said that without thunder and lightning there was no\r\nrisk of a heavy snow-storm.  The peril is imminent, and the difficulty\r\nof subsequent escape great, to any one overtaken by bad weather between\r\nthe two ranges. A certain cave offers the only place of refuge: Mr.\r\nCaldcleugh, who crossed on this same day of the month, was detained\r\nthere for some time by a heavy fall of snow.  Casuchas, or houses of\r\nrefuge, have not been built in this pass as in that of Uspallata, and,\r\ntherefore, during the autumn, the Portillo is little frequented.  I may\r\nhere remark that within the main Cordillera rain never falls, for\r\nduring the summer the sky is cloudless, and in winter snow-storms alone\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nAt the place where we slept water necessarily boiled, from the\r\ndiminished pressure of the atmosphere, at a lower temperature than it\r\ndoes in a less lofty country; the case being the converse of that of a\r\nPapin's digester.  Hence the potatoes, after remaining for some hours\r\nin the boiling water, were nearly as hard as ever.  The pot was left on\r\nthe fire all night, and next morning it was boiled again, but yet the\r\npotatoes were not cooked.  I found out this, by overhearing my two\r\ncompanions discussing the cause, they had come to the simple\r\nconclusion, \"that the cursed pot [which was a new one] did not choose\r\nto boil potatoes.\"\r\n\r\nMarch  22nd.--After eating our potatoless breakfast, we travelled\r\nacross the intermediate tract to the foot of the Portillo range.  In\r\nthe middle of summer cattle are brought up here to graze; but they had\r\nnow all been removed: even the greater number of the Guanacos had\r\ndecamped, knowing well that if overtaken here by a snow-storm, they\r\nwould be caught in a trap.  We had a fine view of a mass of mountains\r\ncalled Tupungato, the whole clothed with unbroken snow, in the midst of\r\nwhich there was a blue patch, no doubt a glacier;--a circumstance of\r\nrare occurrence in these mountains.  Now commenced a heavy and long\r\nclimb, similar to that of the Peuquenes.  Bold conical hills of red\r\ngranite rose on each hand; in the valleys there were several broad\r\nfields of perpetual snow.  These frozen masses, during the process of\r\nthawing, had in some parts been converted into pinnacles or columns,\r\n[4] which, as they were high and close together, made it difficult for\r\nthe cargo mules to pass. On one of these columns of ice, a frozen horse\r\nwas sticking as on a pedestal, but with its hind legs straight up in\r\nthe air.  The animal, I suppose, must have fallen with its head\r\ndownward into a hole, when the snow was continuous, and afterwards the\r\nsurrounding parts must have been removed by the thaw.\r\n\r\nWhen nearly on the crest of the Portillo, we were enveloped in a\r\nfalling cloud of minute frozen spicula.  This was very unfortunate, as\r\nit continued the whole day, and quite intercepted our view.  The pass\r\ntakes its name of Portillo, from a narrow cleft or doorway on the\r\nhighest ridge, through which the road passes.  From this point, on a\r\nclear day, those vast plains which uninterruptedly extend to the\r\nAtlantic Ocean can be seen.  We descended to the upper limit of\r\nvegetation, and found good quarters for the night under the shelter of\r\nsome large fragments of rock.  We met here some passengers, who made\r\nanxious inquiries about the state of the road.  Shortly after it was\r\ndark the clouds suddenly cleared away, and the effect was quite\r\nmagical.  The great mountains, bright with the full moon, seemed\r\nimpending over us on all sides, as over a deep crevice: one morning,\r\nvery early, I witnessed the same striking effect.  As soon as the\r\nclouds were dispersed it froze severely; but as there was no wind, we\r\nslept very comfortably.\r\n\r\nThe increased brilliancy of the moon and stars at this elevation, owing\r\nto the perfect transparency of the atmosphere, was very remarkable.\r\nTravelers having observed the difficulty of judging heights and\r\ndistances amidst lofty mountains, have generally attributed it to the\r\nabsence of objects of comparison.  It appears to me, that it is fully\r\nas much owing to the transparency of the air confounding objects at\r\ndifferent distances, and likewise partly to the novelty of an unusual\r\ndegree of fatigue arising from a little exertion,--habit being thus\r\nopposed to the evidence of the senses.  I am sure that this extreme\r\nclearness of the air gives a peculiar character to the landscape, all\r\nobjects appearing to be brought nearly into one plane, as in a drawing\r\nor panorama.  The transparency is, I presume, owing to the equable and\r\nhigh state of atmospheric dryness.  This dryness was shown by the\r\nmanner in which woodwork shrank (as I soon found by the trouble my\r\ngeological hammer gave me); by articles of food, such as bread and\r\nsugar, becoming extremely hard; and by the preservation of the skin and\r\nparts of the flesh of the beasts, which had perished on the road.  To\r\nthe same cause we must attribute the singular facility with which\r\nelectricity is excited.  My flannel waistcoat, when rubbed in the dark,\r\nappeared as if it had been washed with phosphorus,--every hair on a\r\ndog's back crackled;--even the linen sheets, and leathern straps of the\r\nsaddle, when handled, emitted sparks.\r\n\r\nMarch 23rd.--The descent on the eastern side of the Cordillera is much\r\nshorter or steeper than on the Pacific side; in other words, the\r\nmountains rise more abruptly from the plains than from the alpine\r\ncountry of Chile.  A level and brilliantly white sea of clouds was\r\nstretched out beneath our feet, shutting out the view of the equally\r\nlevel Pampas.  We soon entered the band of clouds, and did not again\r\nemerge from it that day.  About noon, finding pasture for the animals\r\nand bushes for firewood at Los Arenales, we stopped for the night. This\r\nwas near the uppermost limit of bushes, and the elevation, I suppose,\r\nwas between seven and eight thousand feet.\r\n\r\nI was much struck with the marked difference between the vegetation of\r\nthese eastern valleys and those on the Chilian side: yet the climate,\r\nas well as the kind of soil, is nearly the same, and the difference of\r\nlongitude very trifling. The same remark holds good with the\r\nquadrupeds, and in a lesser degree with the birds and insects.  I may\r\ninstance the mice, of which I obtained thirteen species on the shores\r\nof the Atlantic, and five on the Pacific, and not one of them is\r\nidentical.  We must except all those species, which habitually or\r\noccasionally frequent elevated mountains; and certain birds, which\r\nrange as far south as the Strait of Magellan. This fact is in perfect\r\naccordance with the geological history of the Andes; for these\r\nmountains have existed as a great barrier since the present races of\r\nanimals have appeared; and therefore, unless we suppose the same\r\nspecies to have been created in two different places, we ought not to\r\nexpect any closer similarity between the organic beings on the opposite\r\nsides of the Andes than on the opposite shores of the ocean.  In both\r\ncases, we must leave out of the question those kinds which have been\r\nable to cross the barrier, whether of solid rock or salt-water. [5]\r\n\r\nA great number of the plants and animals were absolutely the same as,\r\nor most closely allied to, those of Patagonia. We here have the agouti,\r\nbizcacha, three species of armadillo, the ostrich, certain kinds of\r\npartridges and other birds, none of which are ever seen in Chile, but\r\nare the characteristic animals of the desert plains of Patagonia.  We\r\nhave likewise many of the same (to the eyes of a person who is not a\r\nbotanist) thorny stunted bushes, withered grass, and dwarf plants. Even\r\nthe black slowly crawling beetles are closely similar, and some, I\r\nbelieve, on rigorous examination, absolutely identical.  It had always\r\nbeen to me a subject of regret, that we were unavoidably compelled to\r\ngive up the ascent of the S. Cruz river before reaching the mountains:\r\nI always had a latent hope of meeting with some great change in the\r\nfeatures of the country; but I now feel sure, that it would only have\r\nbeen following the plains of Patagonia up a mountainous ascent.\r\n\r\nMarch  24th.--Early in the morning I climbed up a mountain on one side\r\nof the valley, and enjoyed a far extended view over the Pampas. This\r\nwas a spectacle to which I had always looked forward with interest, but\r\nI was disappointed: at the first glance it much resembled a distant\r\nview of the ocean, but in the northern parts many irregularities were\r\nsoon distinguishable.  The most striking feature consisted in the\r\nrivers, which, facing the rising sun, glittered like silver threads,\r\ntill lost in the immensity of the distance.  At midday we descended the\r\nvalley, and reached a hovel, where an officer and three soldiers were\r\nposted to examine passports. One of these men was a thoroughbred Pampas\r\nIndian: he was kept much for the same purpose as a bloodhound, to track\r\nout any person who might pass by secretly, either on foot or horseback.\r\nSome years ago, a passenger endeavoured to escape detection, by making\r\na long circuit over a neighbouring mountain; but this Indian, having by\r\nchance crossed his track, followed it for the whole day over dry and\r\nvery stony hills, till at last he came on his prey hidden in a gully.\r\nWe here heard that the silvery clouds, which we had admired from the\r\nbright region above, had poured down torrents of rain.  The valley from\r\nthis point gradually opened, and the hills became mere water-worn\r\nhillocks compared to the giants behind: it then expanded into a gently\r\nsloping plain of shingle, covered with low trees and bushes.  This\r\ntalus, although appearing narrow, must be nearly ten miles wide before\r\nit blends into the apparently dead level Pampas.  We passed the only\r\nhouse in this neighbourhood, the Estancia of Chaquaio: and at sunset we\r\npulled up in the first snug corner, and there bivouacked.\r\n\r\nMarch 25th.--I  was reminded of the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, by seeing\r\nthe disk of the rising sun, intersected by an horizon level as that of\r\nthe ocean.  During the night a heavy dew fell, a circumstance which we\r\ndid not experience within the Cordillera.  The road proceeded for some\r\ndistance due east across a low swamp; then meeting the dry plain, it\r\nturned to the north towards Mendoza.  The distance is two very long\r\ndays' journey.  Our first day's journey was called fourteen leagues to\r\nEstacado, and the second seventeen to Luxan, near Mendoza.  The whole\r\ndistance is over a level desert plain, with not more than two or three\r\nhouses.  The sun was exceedingly powerful, and the ride devoid of all\r\ninterest.  There is very little water in this \"traversia,\" and in our\r\nsecond day's journey we found only one little pool. Little water flows\r\nfrom the mountains, and it soon becomes absorbed by the dry and porous\r\nsoil; so that, although we travelled at the distance of only ten or\r\nfifteen miles from the outer range of the Cordillera, we did not cross\r\na single stream.  In many parts the ground was incrusted with a saline\r\nefflorescence; hence we had the same salt-loving plants which are\r\ncommon near Bahia Blanca.  The landscape has a uniform character from\r\nthe Strait of Magellan, along the whole eastern coast of Patagonia, to\r\nthe Rio Colorado; and it appears that the same kind of country extends\r\ninland from this river, in a sweeping line as far as San Luis and\r\nperhaps even further north.  To the eastward of this curved line lies\r\nthe basin of the comparatively damp and green plains of Buenos Ayres.\r\nThe sterile plains of Mendoza and Patagonia consist of a bed of\r\nshingle, worn smooth and accumulated by the waves of the sea while the\r\nPampas, covered by thistles, clover, and grass, have been formed by the\r\nancient estuary mud of the Plata.\r\n\r\nAfter our two days' tedious journey, it was refreshing to see in the\r\ndistance the rows of poplars and willows growing round the village and\r\nriver of Luxan.  Shortly before we arrived at this place, we observed\r\nto the south a ragged cloud of dark reddish-brown colour.  At first we\r\nthought that it was smoke from some great fire on the plains; but we\r\nsoon found that it was a swarm of locusts.  They were flying northward;\r\nand with the aid of a light breeze, they overtook us at a rate of ten\r\nor fifteen miles an hour.  The main body filled the air from a height\r\nof twenty feet, to that, as it appeared, of two or three thousand above\r\nthe ground; \"and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots\r\nof many horses running to battle:\" or rather, I should say, like a\r\nstrong breeze passing through the rigging of a ship.  The sky, seen\r\nthrough the advanced guard, appeared like a mezzotinto engraving, but\r\nthe main body was impervious to sight; they were not, however, so thick\r\ntogether, but that they could escape a stick waved backwards and\r\nforwards.  When they alighted, they were more numerous than the leaves\r\nin the field, and the surface became reddish instead of being green:\r\nthe swarm having once alighted, the individuals flew from side to side\r\nin all directions.  Locusts are not an uncommon pest in this country:\r\nalready during the season, several smaller swarms had come up from the\r\nsouth, where, as apparently in all other parts of the world, they are\r\nbred in the deserts.  The poor cottagers in vain attempted by lighting\r\nfires, by shouts, and by waving branches to avert the attack.  This\r\nspecies of locust closely resembles, and perhaps is identical with, the\r\nfamous Gryllus migratorius of the East.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Luxan, which is a river of considerable size, though its\r\ncourse towards the sea-coast is very imperfectly known: it is even\r\ndoubtful whether, in passing over the plains, it is not evaporated and\r\nlost.  We slept in the village of Luxan, which is a small place\r\nsurrounded by gardens, and forms the most southern cultivated district\r\nin the Province of Mendoza; it is five leagues south of the capital. At\r\nnight I experienced an attack (for it deserves no less a name) of the\r\n_Benchuca_, a species of Reduvius, the great black bug of the Pampas.\r\nIt is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects, about an inch\r\nlong, crawling over one's body.  Before sucking they are quite thin,\r\nbut afterwards they become round and bloated with blood, and in this\r\nstate are easily crushed.  One which I caught at Iquique, (for they are\r\nfound in Chile and Peru,) was very empty.  When placed on a table, and\r\nthough surrounded by people, if a finger was presented, the bold insect\r\nwould immediately protrude its sucker, make a charge, and if allowed,\r\ndraw blood.  No pain was caused by the wound.  It was curious to watch\r\nits body during the act of sucking, as in less than ten minutes it\r\nchanged from being as flat as a wafer to a globular form. This one\r\nfeast, for which the benchuca was indebted to one of the officers, kept\r\nit fat during four whole months; but, after the first fortnight, it was\r\nquite ready to have another suck.\r\n\r\nMarch 27th.--We rode on to Mendoza.  The country was beautifully\r\ncultivated, and resembled Chile.  This neighbourhood is celebrated for\r\nits fruit; and certainly nothing could appear more flourishing than the\r\nvineyards and the orchards of figs, peaches, and olives.  We bought\r\nwater-melons nearly twice as large as a man's head, most deliciously\r\ncool and well-flavoured, for a halfpenny apiece; and for the value of\r\nthreepence, half a wheelbarrowful of peaches.  The cultivated and\r\nenclosed part of this province is very small; there is little more than\r\nthat which we passed through between Luxan and the capital.  The land,\r\nas in Chile, owes its fertility entirely to artificial irrigation; and\r\nit is really wonderful to observe how extraordinarily productive a\r\nbarren traversia is thus rendered.\r\n\r\nWe stayed the ensuing day in Mendoza.  The prosperity of the place has\r\nmuch declined of late years.  The inhabitants say \"it is good to live\r\nin, but very bad to grow rich in.\" The lower orders have the lounging,\r\nreckless manners of the Gauchos of the Pampas; and their dress,\r\nriding-gear, and habits of life, are nearly the same.  To my mind the\r\ntown had a stupid, forlorn aspect.  Neither the boasted alameda, nor\r\nthe scenery, is at all comparable with that of Santiago; but to those\r\nwho, coming from Buenos Ayres, have just crossed the unvaried Pampas,\r\nthe gardens and orchards must appear delightful.  Sir F. Head, speaking\r\nof the inhabitants, says, \"They eat their dinners, and it is so very\r\nhot, they go to sleep--and could they do better?\" I quite agree with\r\nSir F. Head: the happy doom of the Mendozinos is to eat, sleep and be\r\nidle.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 29th.--We set out on our return to Chile, by the Uspallata pass\r\nsituated north of Mendoza.  We had to cross a long and most sterile\r\ntraversia of fifteen leagues.  The soil in parts was absolutely bare,\r\nin others covered by numberless dwarf cacti, armed with formidable\r\nspines, and called by the inhabitants \"little lions.\" There were, also,\r\na few low bushes.  Although the plain is nearly three thousand feet\r\nabove the sea, the sun was very powerful; and the heat as well as the\r\nclouds of impalpable dust, rendered the travelling extremely irksome.\r\nOur course during the day lay nearly parallel to the Cordillera, but\r\ngradually approaching them. Before sunset we entered one of the wide\r\nvalleys, or rather bays, which open on the plain: this soon narrowed\r\ninto a ravine, where a little higher up the house of Villa Vicencio is\r\nsituated.  As we had ridden all day without a drop of water, both our\r\nmules and selves were very thirsty, and we looked out anxiously for the\r\nstream which flows down this valley.  It was curious to observe how\r\ngradually the water made its appearance: on the plain the course was\r\nquite dry; by degrees it became a little damper; then puddles of water\r\nappeared; these soon became connected; and at Villa Vicencio there was\r\na nice little rivulet.\r\n\r\n30th.--The solitary hovel which bears the imposing name of Villa\r\nVicencio, has been mentioned by every traveller who has crossed the\r\nAndes.  I stayed here and at some neighbouring mines during the two\r\nsucceeding days.  The geology of the surrounding country is very\r\ncurious.  The Uspallata range is separated from the main Cordillera by\r\na long narrow plain or basin, like those so often mentioned in Chile,\r\nbut higher, being six thousand feet above the sea.  This range has\r\nnearly the same geographical position with respect to the Cordillera,\r\nwhich the gigantic Portillo line has, but it is of a totally different\r\norigin: it consists of various kinds of submarine lava, alternating\r\nwith volcanic sandstones and other remarkable sedimentary deposits; the\r\nwhole having a very close resemblance to some of the tertiary beds on\r\nthe shores of the Pacific.  From this resemblance I expected to find\r\nsilicified wood, which is generally characteristic of those formations.\r\nI was gratified in a very extraordinary manner. In the central part of\r\nthe range, at an elevation of about seven thousand feet, I observed on\r\na bare slope some snow-white projecting columns.  These were petrified\r\ntrees, eleven being silicified, and from thirty to forty converted into\r\ncoarsely-crystallized white calcareous spar.  They were abruptly broken\r\noff, the upright stumps projecting a few feet above the ground.  The\r\ntrunks measured from three to five feet each in circumference.  They\r\nstood a little way apart from each other, but the whole formed one\r\ngroup.  Mr. Robert Brown has been kind enough to examine the wood: he\r\nsays it belongs to the fir tribe, partaking of the character of the\r\nAraucarian family, but with some curious points of affinity with the\r\nyew.  The volcanic sandstone in which the trees were embedded, and from\r\nthe lower part of which they must have sprung, had accumulated in\r\nsuccessive thin layers around their trunks; and the stone yet retained\r\nthe impression of the bark.\r\n\r\nIt required little geological practice to interpret the marvellous\r\nstory which this scene at once unfolded; though I confess I was at\r\nfirst so much astonished that I could scarcely believe the plainest\r\nevidence.  I saw the spot where a cluster of fine trees once waved\r\ntheir branches on the shores of the Atlantic, when that ocean (now\r\ndriven back 700 miles) came to the foot of the Andes.  I saw that they\r\nhad sprung from a volcanic soil which had been raised above the level\r\nof the sea, and that subsequently this dry land, with its upright\r\ntrees, had been let down into the depths of the ocean.  In these\r\ndepths, the formerly dry land was covered by sedimentary beds, and\r\nthese again by enormous streams of submarine lava--one such mass\r\nattaining the thickness of a thousand feet; and these deluges of molten\r\nstone and aqueous deposits five times alternately had been spread out.\r\nThe ocean which received such thick masses, must have been profoundly\r\ndeep; but again the subterranean forces exerted themselves, and I now\r\nbeheld the bed of that ocean, forming a chain of mountains more than\r\nseven thousand feet in height.  Nor had those antagonistic forces been\r\ndormant, which are always at work wearing down the surface of the land;\r\nthe great piles of strata had been intersected by many wide valleys,\r\nand the trees now changed into silex, were exposed projecting from the\r\nvolcanic soil, now changed into rock, whence formerly, in a green and\r\nbudding state, they had raised their lofty heads.  Now, all is utterly\r\nirreclaimable and desert; even the lichen cannot adhere to the stony\r\ncasts of former trees.  Vast, and scarcely comprehensible as such\r\nchanges must ever appear, yet they have all occurred within a period,\r\nrecent when compared with the history of the Cordillera; and the\r\nCordillera itself is absolutely modern as compared with many of the\r\nfossiliferous strata of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nApril 1st.--We crossed the Upsallata range, and at night slept at the\r\ncustom-house--the only inhabited spot on the plain.  Shortly before\r\nleaving the mountains, there was a very extraordinary view; red,\r\npurple, green, and quite white sedimentary rocks, alternating with\r\nblack lavas, were broken up and thrown into all kinds of disorder by\r\nmasses of porphyry of every shade of colour, from dark brown to the\r\nbrightest lilac.  It was the first view I ever saw, which really\r\nresembled those pretty sections which geologists make of the inside of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe next day we crossed the plain, and followed the course of the same\r\ngreat mountain stream which flows by Luxan. Here it was a furious\r\ntorrent, quite impassable, and appeared larger than in the low country,\r\nas was the case with the rivulet of Villa Vicencio.  On the evening of\r\nthe succeeding day, we reached the Rio de las Vacas, which is\r\nconsidered the worst stream in the Cordillera to cross.  As all these\r\nrivers have a rapid and short course, and are formed by the melting of\r\nthe snow, the hour of the day makes a considerable difference in their\r\nvolume.  In the evening the stream is muddy and full, but about\r\ndaybreak it becomes clearer, and much less impetuous.  This we found to\r\nbe the case with the Rio Vacas, and in the morning we crossed it with\r\nlittle difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe scenery thus far was very uninteresting, compared with that of the\r\nPortillo pass.  Little can be seen beyond the bare walls of the one\r\ngrand flat-bottomed valley, which the road follows up to the highest\r\ncrest.  The valley and the huge rocky mountains are extremely barren:\r\nduring the two previous nights the poor mules had absolutely nothing to\r\neat, for excepting a few low resinous bushes, scarcely a plant can be\r\nseen.  In the course of this day we crossed some of the worst passes in\r\nthe Cordillera, but their danger has been much exaggerated.  I was told\r\nthat if I attempted to pass on foot, my head would turn giddy, and that\r\nthere was no room to dismount; but I did not see a place where any one\r\nmight not have walked over backwards, or got off his mule on either\r\nside.  One of the bad passes, called _las Animas_ (the souls), I had\r\ncrossed, and did not find out till a day afterwards, that it was one of\r\nthe awful dangers. No doubt there are many parts in which, if the mule\r\nshould stumble, the rider would be hurled down a great precipice; but\r\nof this there is little chance.  I dare say, in the spring, the\r\n\"laderas,\" or roads, which each year are formed anew across the piles\r\nof fallen detritus, are very bad; but from what I saw, I suspect the\r\nreal danger is nothing.  With cargo-mules the case is rather different,\r\nfor the loads project so far, that the animals, occasionally running\r\nagainst each other, or against a point of rock, lose their balance, and\r\nare thrown down the precipices.  In crossing the rivers I can well\r\nbelieve that the difficulty may be very great: at this season there was\r\nlittle trouble, but in the summer they must be very hazardous.  I can\r\nquite imagine, as Sir F. Head describes, the different expressions of\r\nthose who _have_ passed the gulf, and those who _are_ passing.  I never\r\nheard of any man being drowned, but with loaded mules it frequently\r\nhappens.  The arriero tells you to show your mule the best line, and\r\nthen allow her to cross as she likes: the cargo-mule takes a bad line,\r\nand is often lost.\r\n\r\nApril 4th.--From the Rio de las Vacas to the Puente del Incas, half a\r\nday's journey.  As there was pasture for the mules, and geology for me,\r\nwe bivouacked here for the night.  When one hears of a natural Bridge,\r\none pictures to one's self some deep and narrow ravine, across which a\r\nbold mass of rock has fallen; or a great arch hollowed out like the\r\nvault of a cavern.  Instead of this, the Incas Bridge consists of a\r\ncrust of stratified shingle cemented together by the deposits of the\r\nneighbouring hot springs.  It appears, as if the stream had scooped out\r\na channel on one side, leaving an overhanging ledge, which was met by\r\nearth and stones falling down from the opposite cliff.  Certainly an\r\noblique junction, as would happen in such a case, was very distinct on\r\none side.  The Bridge of the Incas is by no means worthy of the great\r\nmonarchs whose name it bears.\r\n\r\n5th.--We had a long day's ride across the central ridge, from the Incas\r\nBridge to the Ojos del Agua, which are situated near the lowest\r\n_casucha_ on the Chilian side.  These casuchas are round little towers,\r\nwith steps outside to reach the floor, which is raised some feet above\r\nthe ground on account of the snow-drifts.  They are eight in number,\r\nand under the Spanish government were kept during the winter well\r\nstored with food and charcoal, and each courier had a master-key.  Now\r\nthey only answer the purpose of caves, or rather dungeons.  Seated on\r\nsome little eminence, they are not, however, ill suited to the\r\nsurrounding scene of desolation. The zigzag ascent of the Cumbre, or\r\nthe partition of the waters, was very steep and tedious; its height,\r\naccording to Mr. Pentland, is 12,454 feet.  The road did not pass over\r\nany perpetual snow, although there were patches of it on both hands.\r\nThe wind on the summit was exceedingly cold, but it was impossible not\r\nto stop for a few minutes to admire, again and again, the colour of the\r\nheavens, and the brilliant transparency of the atmosphere.  The scenery\r\nwas grand: to the westward there was a fine chaos of mountains, divided\r\nby profound ravines.  Some snow generally falls before this period of\r\nthe season, and it has even happened that the Cordillera have been\r\nfinally closed by this time.  But we were most fortunate.  The sky, by\r\nnight and by day, was cloudless, excepting a few round little masses of\r\nvapour, that floated over the highest pinnacles.  I have often seen\r\nthese islets in the sky, marking the position of the Cordillera, when\r\nthe far-distant mountains have been hidden beneath the horizon.\r\n\r\nApril 6th.--In the morning we found some thief had stolen one of our\r\nmules, and the bell of the madrina.  We therefore rode only two or\r\nthree miles down the valley, and stayed there the ensuing day in hopes\r\nof recovering the mule, which the arriero thought had been hidden in\r\nsome ravine. The scenery in this part had assumed a Chilian character:\r\nthe lower sides of the mountains, dotted over with the pale evergreen\r\nQuillay tree, and with the great chandelier-like cactus, are certainly\r\nmore to be admired than the bare eastern valleys; but I cannot quite\r\nagree with the admiration expressed by some travellers.  The extreme\r\npleasure, I suspect, is chiefly owing to the prospect of a good fire\r\nand of a good supper, after escaping from the cold regions above: and I\r\nam sure I most heartily participated in these feelings.\r\n\r\n8th.--We left the valley of the Aconcagua, by which we had descended,\r\nand reached in the evening a cottage near the Villa del St. Rosa.  The\r\nfertility of the plain was delightful: the autumn being advanced, the\r\nleaves of many of the fruit-trees were falling; and of the\r\nlabourers,--some were busy in drying figs and peaches on the roofs of\r\ntheir cottages, while others were gathering the grapes from the\r\nvineyards. It was a pretty scene; but I missed that pensive stillness\r\nwhich makes the autumn in England indeed the evening of the year.  On\r\nthe 10th we reached Santiago, where I received a very kind and\r\nhospitable reception from Mr. Caldcleugh. My excursion only cost me\r\ntwenty-four days, and never did I more deeply enjoy an equal space of\r\ntime.  A few days afterwards I returned to Mr. Corfield's house at\r\nValparaiso.\r\n\r\n[1] Scoresby's Arctic Regions, vol. i. p. 122.\r\n\r\n[2] I have heard it remarked in Shropshire that the water, when the\r\nSevern is flooded from long-continued rain, is much more turbid than\r\nwhen it proceeds from the snow melting in the Welsh mountains.\r\nD'Orbigny (tom. i. p. 184), in explaining the cause of the various\r\ncolours of the rivers in South America, remarks that those with blue or\r\nclear water have there source in the Cordillera, where the snow melts.\r\n\r\n[3] Dr. Gillies in Journ. of Nat. and Geograph. Science, Aug., 1830.\r\nThis author gives the heights of the Passes.\r\n\r\n[4] This structure in frozen snow was long since observed by Scoresby\r\nin the icebergs near Spitzbergen, and, lately, with more care, by\r\nColonel Jackson (Journ. of Geograph. Soc., vol. v. p. 12) on the Neva.\r\nMr. Lyell (Principles, vol. iv. p. 360) has compared the fissures by\r\nwhich the columnar structure seems to be determined, to the joints that\r\ntraverse nearly all rocks, but which are best seen in the\r\nnon-stratified masses.  I may observe, that in the case of the frozen\r\nsnow, the columnar structure must be owing to a \"metamorphic\" action,\r\nand not to a process during deposition.\r\n\r\n[5] This is merely an illustration of the admirable laws, first laid\r\ndown by Mr. Lyell, on the geographical distribution of animals, as\r\ninfluenced by geological changes.  The whole reasoning, of course, is\r\nfounded on the assumption of the immutability of species; otherwise the\r\ndifference in the species in the two regions might be considered as\r\nsuperinduced during a length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nNORTHERN CHILE AND PERU\r\n\r\nCoast-road to Coquimbo--Great Loads carried by the\r\nMiners--Coquimbo--Earthquake--Step-formed Terrace--Absence of recent\r\nDeposits--Contemporaneousness of the Tertiary Formations--Excursion up\r\nthe Valley--Road to Guasco--Deserts--Valley of Copiapo--Rain and\r\nEarthquakes--Hydrophobia--The Despoblado--Indian Ruins--Probable Change\r\nof Climate--River-bed arched by an Earthquake--Cold Gales of\r\nWind--Noises from a Hill--Iquique--Salt Alluvium--Nitrate of\r\nSoda--Lima--Unhealthy Country--Ruins of Callao, overthrown by an\r\nEarthquake--Recent Subsidence--Elevated Shells on San Lorenzo, their\r\ndecomposition--Plain with embedded Shells and fragments of\r\nPottery--Antiquity of the Indian Race.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 27th.--I set out on a journey to Coquimbo, and thence through\r\nGuasco to Copiapo, where Captain Fitz Roy kindly offered to pick me up\r\nin the Beagle. The distance in a straight line along the shore\r\nnorthward is only 420 miles; but my mode of travelling made it a very\r\nlong journey.  I bought four horses and two mules, the latter carrying\r\nthe luggage on alternate days.  The six animals together only cost the\r\nvalue of twenty-five pounds sterling, and at Copiapo I sold them again\r\nfor twenty-three. We travelled in the same independent manner as\r\nbefore, cooking our own meals, and sleeping in the open air.  As we\r\nrode towards the Vino del Mar, I took a farewell view of Valparaiso,\r\nand admired its picturesque appearance.  For geological purposes I made\r\na detour from the high road to the foot of the Bell of Quillota.  We\r\npassed through an alluvial district rich in gold, to the neighbourhood\r\nof Limache, where we slept.  Washing for gold supports the inhabitants\r\nof numerous hovels, scattered along the sides of each little rivulet;\r\nbut, like all those whose gains are uncertain, they are unthrifty in\r\nall their habits, and consequently poor.\r\n\r\n28th.--In the afternoon we arrived at a cottage at the foot of the Bell\r\nmountain.  The inhabitants were freeholders, which is not very usual in\r\nChile.  They supported themselves on the produce of a garden and a\r\nlittle field, but were very poor.  Capital is here so deficient, that\r\nthe people are obliged to sell their green corn while standing in the\r\nfield, in order to buy necessaries for the ensuing year.  Wheat in\r\nconsequence was dearer in the very district of its production than at\r\nValparaiso, where the contractors live.  The next day we joined the\r\nmain road to Coquimbo.  At night there was a very light shower of rain:\r\nthis was the first drop that had fallen since the heavy rain of\r\nSeptember 11th and 12th, which detained me a prisoner at the Baths of\r\nCauquenes. The interval was seven and a half months; but the rain this\r\nyear in Chile was rather later than usual.  The distant Andes were now\r\ncovered by a thick mass of snow, and were a glorious sight.\r\n\r\nMay 2nd.--The road continued to follow the coast, at no great distance\r\nfrom the sea.  The few trees and bushes which are common in central\r\nChile decreased rapidly in numbers, and were replaced by a tall plant,\r\nsomething like a yucca in appearance.  The surface of the country, on a\r\nsmall scale, was singularly broken and irregular; abrupt little peaks\r\nof rock rising out of small plains or basins.  The indented coast and\r\nthe bottom of the neighbouring sea, studded with breakers, would, if\r\nconverted into dry land, present similar forms; and such a conversion\r\nwithout doubt has taken place in the part over which we rode.\r\n\r\n3rd.--Quilimari to Conchalee.  The country became more and more barren.\r\nIn the valleys there was scarcely sufficient water for any irrigation;\r\nand the intermediate land was quite bare, not supporting even goats. In\r\nthe spring, after the winter showers, a thin pasture rapidly springs\r\nup, and cattle are then driven down from the Cordillera to graze for a\r\nshort time.  It is curious to observe how the seeds of the grass and\r\nother plants seem to accommodate themselves, as if by an acquired\r\nhabit, to the quantity of rain which falls upon different parts of this\r\ncoast.  One shower far northward at Copiapo produces as great an effect\r\non the vegetation, as two at Guasco, and three or four in this\r\ndistrict.  At Valparaiso a winter so dry as greatly to injure the\r\npasture, would at Guasco produce the most unusual abundance. Proceeding\r\nnorthward, the quantity of rain does not appear to decrease in strict\r\nproportion to the latitude. At Conchalee, which is only 67 miles north\r\nof Valparaiso, rain is not expected till the end of May; whereas at\r\nValparaiso some generally falls early in April: the annual quantity is\r\nlikewise small in proportion to the lateness of the season at which it\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\n4th.--Finding the coast-road devoid of interest of any kind, we turned\r\ninland towards the mining district and valley of Illapel.  This valley,\r\nlike every other in Chile, is level, broad, and very fertile: it is\r\nbordered on each side, either by cliffs of stratified shingle, or by\r\nbare rocky mountains.  Above the straight line of the uppermost\r\nirrigating ditch, all is brown as on a high road; while all below is of\r\nas bright a green as verdigris, from the beds of alfalfa, a kind of\r\nclover.  We proceeded to Los Hornos, another mining district, where the\r\nprincipal hill was drilled with holes, like a great ants'-nest.  The\r\nChilian miners are a peculiar race of men in their habits.  Living for\r\nweeks together in the most desolate spots, when they descend to the\r\nvillages on feast-days, there is no excess of extravagance into which\r\nthey do not run.  They sometimes gain a considerable sum, and then,\r\nlike sailors with prize-money, they try how soon they can contrive to\r\nsquander it.  They drink excessively, buy quantities of clothes, and in\r\na few days return penniless to their miserable abodes, there to work\r\nharder than beasts of burden.  This thoughtlessness, as with sailors,\r\nis evidently the result of a similar manner of life.  Their daily food\r\nis found them, and they acquire no habits of carefulness: moreover,\r\ntemptation and the means of yielding to it are placed in their power at\r\nthe same time.  On the other hand, in Cornwall, and some other parts of\r\nEngland, where the system of selling part of the vein is followed, the\r\nminers, from being obliged to act and think for themselves, are a\r\nsingularly intelligent and well-conducted set of men.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the Chilian miner is peculiar and rather picturesque He\r\nwears a very long shirt of some dark-coloured baize, with a leathern\r\napron; the whole being fastened round his waist by a bright-coloured\r\nsash.  His trousers are very broad, and his small cap of scarlet cloth\r\nis made to fit the head closely.  We met a party of these miners in\r\nfull costume, carrying the body of one of their companions to be\r\nburied.  They marched at a very quick trot, four men supporting the\r\ncorpse.  One set having run as hard as they could for about two hundred\r\nyards, were relieved by four others, who had previously dashed on ahead\r\non horseback. Thus they proceeded, encouraging each other by wild\r\ncries: altogether the scene formed a most strange funeral.\r\n\r\nWe continued travelling northward, in a zigzag line; sometimes stopping\r\na day to geologize.  The country was so thinly inhabited, and the track\r\nso obscure, that we often had difficulty in finding our way.  On the\r\n12th I stayed at some mines.  The ore in this case was not considered\r\nparticularly good, but from being abundant it was supposed the mine\r\nwould sell for about thirty or forty thousand dollars (that is, 6000 or\r\n8000 pounds sterling); yet it had been bought by one of the English\r\nAssociations for an ounce of gold (3l. 8s.).  The ore is yellow\r\npyrites, which, as I have already remarked, before the arrival of the\r\nEnglish, was not supposed to contain a particle of copper.  On a scale\r\nof profits nearly as great as in the above instance, piles of cinders,\r\nabounding with minute globules of metallic copper, were purchased; yet\r\nwith these advantages, the mining associations, as is well known,\r\ncontrived to lose immense sums of money.  The folly of the greater\r\nnumber of the commissioners and shareholders amounted to\r\ninfatuation;--a thousand pounds per annum given in some cases to\r\nentertain the Chilian authorities; libraries of well-bound geological\r\nbooks; miners brought out for particular metals, as tin, which are not\r\nfound in Chile; contracts to supply the miners with milk, in parts\r\nwhere there are no cows; machinery, where it could not possibly be\r\nused; and a hundred similar arrangements, bore witness to our\r\nabsurdity, and to this day afford amusement to the natives.  Yet there\r\ncan be no doubt, that the same capital well employed in these mines\r\nwould have yielded an immense return, a confidential man of business, a\r\npractical miner and assayer, would have been all that was required.\r\n\r\nCaptain Head has described the wonderful load which the \"Apires,\" truly\r\nbeasts of burden, carry up from the deepest mines.  I confess I thought\r\nthe account exaggerated: so that I was glad to take an opportunity of\r\nweighing one of the loads, which I picked out by hazard.  It required\r\nconsiderable exertion on my part, when standing directly over it, to\r\nlift it from the ground.  The load was considered under weight when\r\nfound to be 197 pounds.  The apire had carried this up eighty\r\nperpendicular yards,--part of the way by a steep passage, but the\r\ngreater part up notched poles, placed in a zigzag line up the shaft.\r\nAccording to the general regulation, the apire is not allowed to halt\r\nfor breath, except the mine is six hundred feet deep.  The average load\r\nis considered as rather more than 200 pounds, and I have been assured\r\nthat one of 300 pounds (twenty-two stone and a half) by way of a trial\r\nhas been brought up from the deepest mine! At this time the apires were\r\nbringing up the usual load twelve times in the day; that is 2400 pounds\r\nfrom eighty yards deep; and they were employed in the intervals in\r\nbreaking and picking ore.\r\n\r\nThese men, excepting from accidents, are healthy, and appear cheerful.\r\nTheir bodies are not very muscular.  They rarely eat meat once a week,\r\nand never oftener, and then only the hard dry charqui.  Although with a\r\nknowledge that the labour was voluntary, it was nevertheless quite\r\nrevolting to see the state in which they reached the mouth of the mine;\r\ntheir bodies bent forward, leaning with their arms on the steps, their\r\nlegs bowed, their muscles quivering, the perspiration streaming from\r\ntheir faces over their breasts, their nostrils distended, the corners\r\nof their mouth forcibly drawn back, and the expulsion of their breath\r\nmost laborious. Each time they draw their breath, they utter an\r\narticulate cry of \"ay-ay,\" which ends in a sound rising from deep in\r\nthe chest, but shrill like the note of a fife.  After staggering to the\r\npile of ore, they emptied the \"carpacho;\" in two or three seconds\r\nrecovering their breath, they wiped the sweat from their brows, and\r\napparently quite fresh descended the mine again at a quick pace.  This\r\nappears to me a wonderful instance of the amount of labour which habit,\r\nfor it can be nothing else, will enable a man to endure.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, talking with the _mayor-domo_ of these mines about the\r\nnumber of foreigners now scattered over the whole country, he told me\r\nthat, though quite a young man, he remembers when he was a boy at\r\nschool at Coquimbo, a holiday being given to see the captain of an\r\nEnglish ship, who was brought to the city to speak to the governor.  He\r\nbelieves that nothing would have induced any boy in the school, himself\r\nincluded, to have gone close to the Englishman; so deeply had they been\r\nimpressed with an idea of the heresy, contamination, and evil to be\r\nderived from contact with such a person.  To this day they relate the\r\natrocious actions of the bucaniers; and especially of one man, who took\r\naway the figure of the Virgin Mary, and returned the year after for\r\nthat of St. Joseph, saying it was a pity the lady should not have a\r\nhusband.  I heard also of an old lady who, at a dinner at Coquimbo,\r\nremarked how wonderfully strange it was that she should have lived to\r\ndine in the same room with an Englishman; for she remembered as a girl,\r\nthat twice, at the mere cry of \"Los Ingleses,\" every soul, carrying\r\nwhat valuables they could, had taken to the mountains.\r\n\r\n14th.--We reached Coquimbo, where we stayed a few days.  The town is\r\nremarkable for nothing but its extreme quietness.  It is said to\r\ncontain from 6000 to 8000 inhabitants. On the morning of the 17th it\r\nrained lightly, the first time this year, for about five hours.  The\r\nfarmers, who plant corn near the sea-coast where the atmosphere is most\r\nhumid, taking advantage of this shower, would break up the ground;\r\nafter a second they would put the seed in; and if a third shower should\r\nfall, they would reap a good harvest in the spring.  It was interesting\r\nto watch the effect of this trifling amount of moisture.  Twelve hours\r\nafterwards the ground appeared as dry as ever; yet after an interval of\r\nten days, all the hills were faintly tinged with green patches; the\r\ngrass being sparingly scattered in hair-like fibres a full inch in\r\nlength.  Before this shower every part of the surface was bare as on a\r\nhigh road.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, Captain Fitz Roy and myself were dining with Mr.\r\nEdwards, an English resident well known for his hospitality by all who\r\nhave visited Coquimbo, when a sharp earthquake happened.  I heard the\r\nforecoming rumble, but from the screams of the ladies, the running of\r\nthe servants, and the rush of several of the gentlemen to the doorway,\r\nI could not distinguish the motion.  Some of the women afterwards were\r\ncrying with terror, and one gentleman said he should not be able to\r\nsleep all night, or if he did, it would only be to dream of falling\r\nhouses.  The father of this person had lately lost all his property at\r\nTalcahuano, and he himself had only just escaped a falling roof at\r\nValparaiso, in 1822.  He mentioned a curious coincidence which then\r\nhappened: he was playing at cards, when a German, one of the party, got\r\nup, and said he would never sit in a room in these countries with the\r\ndoor shut, as owing to his having done so, he had nearly lost his life\r\nat Copiapo.  Accordingly he opened the door; and no sooner had he done\r\nthis, than he cried out, \"Here it comes again!\" and the famous shock\r\ncommenced.  The whole party escaped.  The danger in an earthquake is\r\nnot from the time lost in opening the door, but from the chance of its\r\nbecoming jammed by the movement of the walls.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to be much surprised at the fear which natives and old\r\nresidents, though some of them known to be men of great command of\r\nmind, so generally experience during earthquakes.  I think, however,\r\nthis excess of panic may be partly attributed to a want of habit in\r\ngoverning their fear, as it is not a feeling they are ashamed of.\r\nIndeed, the natives do not like to see a person indifferent.  I heard\r\nof two Englishmen who, sleeping in the open air during a smart shock,\r\nknowing that there was no danger, did not rise.  The natives cried out\r\nindignantly, \"Look at those heretics, they do not even get out of their\r\nbeds!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI spent some days in examining the step-formed terraces of shingle,\r\nfirst noticed by Captain B. Hall, and believed by Mr. Lyell to have\r\nbeen formed by the sea, during the gradual rising of the land.  This\r\ncertainly is the true explanation, for I found numerous shells of\r\nexisting species on these terraces.  Five narrow, gently sloping,\r\nfringe-like terraces rise one behind the other, and where best\r\ndeveloped are formed of shingle: they front the bay, and sweep up both\r\nsides of the valley.  At Guasco, north of Coquimbo, the phenomenon is\r\ndisplayed on a much grander scale, so as to strike with surprise even\r\nsome of the inhabitants.  The terraces are there much broader, and may\r\nbe called plains, in some parts there are six of them, but generally\r\nonly five; they run up the valley for thirty-seven miles from the\r\ncoast. These step-formed terraces or fringes closely resemble those in\r\nthe valley of S. Cruz, and, except in being on a smaller scale, those\r\ngreat ones along the whole coast-line of Patagonia. They have\r\nundoubtedly been formed by the denuding power of the sea, during long\r\nperiods of rest in the gradual elevation of the continent.\r\n\r\nShells of many existing species not only lie on the surface of the\r\nterraces at Coquimbo (to a height of 250 feet), but are embedded in a\r\nfriable calcareous rock, which in some places is as much as between\r\ntwenty and thirty feet in thickness, but is of little extent.  These\r\nmodern beds rest on an ancient tertiary formation containing shells,\r\napparently all extinct.  Although I examined so many hundred miles of\r\ncoast on the Pacific, as well as Atlantic side of the continent, I\r\nfound no regular strata containing sea-shells of recent species,\r\nexcepting at this place, and at a few points northward on the road to\r\nGuasco.  This fact appears to me highly remarkable; for the explanation\r\ngenerally given by geologists, of the absence in any district of\r\nstratified fossiliferous deposits of a given period, namely, that the\r\nsurface then existed as dry land, is not here applicable; for we know\r\nfrom the shells strewed on the surface and embedded in loose sand or\r\nmould that the land for thousands of miles along both coasts has lately\r\nbeen submerged.  The explanation, no doubt, must be sought in the fact,\r\nthat the whole southern part of the continent has been for a long time\r\nslowly rising; and therefore that all matter deposited along shore in\r\nshallow water, must have been soon brought up and slowly exposed to the\r\nwearing action of the sea-beach; and it is only in comparatively\r\nshallow water that the greater number of marine organic beings can\r\nflourish, and in such water it is obviously impossible that strata of\r\nany great thickness can accumulate.  To show the vast power of the\r\nwearing action of sea-beaches, we need only appeal to the great cliffs\r\nalong the present coast of Patagonia, and to the escarpments or ancient\r\nsea-cliffs at different levels, one above another, on that same line of\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe old underlying tertiary formation at Coquimbo, appears to be of\r\nabout the same age with several deposits on the coast of Chile (of\r\nwhich that of Navedad is the principal one), and with the great\r\nformation of Patagonia. Both at Navedad and in Patagonia there is\r\nevidence, that since the shells (a list of which has been seen by\r\nProfessor E. Forbes) there entombed were living, there has been a\r\nsubsidence of several hundred feet, as well as an ensuing elevation. It\r\nmay naturally be asked, how it comes that, although no extensive\r\nfossiliferous deposits of the recent period, nor of any period\r\nintermediate between it and the ancient tertiary epoch, have been\r\npreserved on either side of the continent, yet that at this ancient\r\ntertiary epoch, sedimentary matter containing fossil remains, should\r\nhave been deposited and preserved at different points in north and\r\nsouth lines, over a space of 1100 miles on the shores of the Pacific,\r\nand of at least 1350 miles on the shores of the Atlantic, and in an\r\neast and west line of 700 miles across the widest part of the\r\ncontinent?  I believe the explanation is not difficult, and that it is\r\nperhaps applicable to nearly analogous facts observed in other quarters\r\nof the world. Considering the enormous power of denudation which the\r\nsea possesses, as shown by numberless facts, it is not probable that a\r\nsedimentary deposit, when being upraised, could pass through the ordeal\r\nof the beach, so as to be preserved in sufficient masses to last to a\r\ndistant period, without it were originally of wide extent and of\r\nconsiderable thickness: now it is impossible on a moderately shallow\r\nbottom, which alone is favourable to most living creatures, that a\r\nthick and widely extended covering of sediment could be spread out,\r\nwithout the bottom sank down to receive the successive layers.  This\r\nseems to have actually taken place at about the same period in southern\r\nPatagonia and Chile, though these places are a thousand miles apart.\r\nHence, if prolonged movements of approximately contemporaneous\r\nsubsidence are generally widely extensive, as I am strongly inclined to\r\nbelieve from my examination of the Coral Reefs of the great oceans--or\r\nif, confining our view to South America, the subsiding movements have\r\nbeen co-extensive with those of elevation, by which, within the same\r\nperiod of existing shells, the shores of Peru, Chile, Tierra del Fuego,\r\nPatagonia, and La Plata have been upraised--then we can see that at the\r\nsame time, at far distant points, circumstances would have been\r\nfavourable to the formation of fossiliferous deposits of wide extent\r\nand of considerable thickness; and such deposits, consequently, would\r\nhave a good chance of resisting the wear and tear of successive\r\nbeach-lines, and of lasting to a future epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 21st.--I set out in company with Don Jose Edwards to the\r\nsilver-mine of Arqueros, and thence up the valley of Coquimbo.  Passing\r\nthrough a mountainous country, we reached by nightfall the mines\r\nbelonging to Mr. Edwards. I enjoyed my night's rest here from a reason\r\nwhich will not be fully appreciated in England, namely, the absence of\r\nfleas!  The rooms in Coquimbo swarm with them; but they will not live\r\nhere at the height of only three or four thousand feet: it can scarcely\r\nbe the trifling diminution of temperature, but some other cause which\r\ndestroys these troublesome insects at this place.  The mines are now in\r\na bad state, though they formerly yielded about 2000 pounds in weight\r\nof silver a year.  It has been said that \"a person with a copper-mine\r\nwill gain; with silver he may gain; but with gold he is sure to lose.\"\r\nThis is not true: all the large Chilian fortunes have been made by\r\nmines of the more precious metals.  A short time since an English\r\nphysician returned to England from Copiapo, taking with him the profits\r\nof one share of a silver-mine, which amounted to about 24,000 pounds\r\nsterling.  No doubt a copper-mine with care is a sure game, whereas the\r\nother is gambling, or rather taking a ticket in a lottery.  The owners\r\nlose great quantities of rich ores; for no precautions can prevent\r\nrobberies. I heard of a gentleman laying a bet with another, that one\r\nof his men should rob him before his face.  The ore when brought out of\r\nthe mine is broken into pieces, and the useless stone thrown on one\r\nside.  A couple of the miners who were thus employed, pitched, as if by\r\naccident, two fragments away at the same moment, and then cried out for\r\na joke \"Let us see which rolls furthest.\" The owner, who was standing\r\nby, bet a cigar with his friend on the race.  The miner by this means\r\nwatched the very point amongst the rubbish where the stone lay.  In the\r\nevening he picked it up and carried it to his master, showing him a\r\nrich mass of silver-ore, and saying, \"This was the stone on which you\r\nwon a cigar by its rolling so far.\"\r\n\r\nMay 23rd.--We descended into the fertile valley of Coquimbo, and\r\nfollowed it till we reached an Hacienda belonging to a relation of Don\r\nJose, where we stayed the next day. I then rode one day's journey\r\nfurther, to see what were declared to be some petrified shells and\r\nbeans, which latter turned out to be small quartz pebbles.  We passed\r\nthrough several small villages; and the valley was beautifully\r\ncultivated, and the whole scenery very grand.  We were here near the\r\nmain Cordillera, and the surrounding hills were lofty.  In all parts of\r\nnorthern Chile, fruit trees produce much more abundantly at a\r\nconsiderable height near the Andes than in the lower country.  The figs\r\nand grapes of this district are famous for their excellence, and are\r\ncultivated to a great extent.  This valley is, perhaps, the most\r\nproductive one north of Quillota.  I believe it contains, including\r\nCoquimbo, 25,000 inhabitants.  The next day I returned to the Hacienda,\r\nand thence, together with Don Jose, to Coquimbo.\r\n\r\nJune 2nd.--We set out for the valley of Guasco, following the\r\ncoast-road, which was considered rather less desert than the other. Our\r\nfirst day's ride was to a solitary house, called Yerba Buena, where\r\nthere was pasture for our horses.  The shower mentioned as having\r\nfallen, a fortnight ago, only reached about half-way to Guasco; we had,\r\ntherefore, in the first part of our journey a most faint tinge of\r\ngreen, which soon faded quite away.  Even where brightest, it was\r\nscarcely sufficient to remind one of the fresh turf and budding flowers\r\nof the spring of other countries.  While travelling through these\r\ndeserts one feels like a prisoner shut up in a gloomy court, who longs\r\nto see something green and to smell a moist atmosphere.\r\n\r\nJune 3rd.--Yerba Buena to Carizal.  During the first part of the day we\r\ncrossed a mountainous rocky desert, and afterwards a long deep sandy\r\nplain, strewed with broken sea-shells. There was very little water, and\r\nthat little saline: the whole country, from the coast to the\r\nCordillera, is an uninhabited desert.  I saw traces only of one living\r\nanimal in abundance, namely, the shells of a Bulimus, which were\r\ncollected together in extraordinary numbers on the driest spots.  In\r\nthe spring one humble little plant sends out a few leaves, and on these\r\nthe snails feed.  As they are seen only very early in the morning, when\r\nthe ground is slightly damp with dew, the Guascos believe that they are\r\nbred from it.  I have observed in other places that extremely dry and\r\nsterile districts, where the soil is calcareous, are extraordinarily\r\nfavourable to land-shells.  At Carizal there were a few cottages, some\r\nbrackish water, and a trace of cultivation: but it was with difficulty\r\nthat we purchased a little corn and straw for our horses.\r\n\r\n4th.--Carizal to Sauce.  We continued to ride over desert plains,\r\ntenanted by large herds of guanaco.  We crossed also the valley of\r\nChaneral; which, although the most fertile one between Guasco and\r\nCoquimbo, is very narrow, and produces so little pasture, that we could\r\nnot purchase any for our horses.  At Sauce we found a very civil old\r\ngentleman, superintendent of a copper-smelting furnace.  As an especial\r\nfavour, he allowed me to purchase at a high price an armful of dirty\r\nstraw, which was all the poor horses had for supper after their long\r\nday's journey.  Few smelting-furnaces are now at work in any part of\r\nChile; it is found more profitable, on account of the extreme scarcity\r\nof firewood, and from the Chilian method of reduction being so\r\nunskilful, to ship the ore for Swansea.  The next day we crossed some\r\nmountains to Freyrina, in the valley of Guasco.  During each day's ride\r\nfurther northward, the vegetation became more and more scanty; even the\r\ngreat chandelier-like cactus was here replaced by a different and much\r\nsmaller species.  During the winter months, both in northern Chile and\r\nin Peru, a uniform bank of clouds hangs, at no great height, over the\r\nPacific. From the mountains we had a very striking view of this white\r\nand brilliant aerial-field, which sent arms up the valleys, leaving\r\nislands and promontories in the same manner, as the sea does in the\r\nChonos archipelago and in Tierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nWe stayed two days at Freyrina.  In the valley of Guasco there are four\r\nsmall towns.  At the mouth there is the port, a spot entirely desert,\r\nand without any water in the immediate neighbourhood.  Five leagues\r\nhigher up stands Freyrina, a long straggling village, with decent\r\nwhitewashed houses. Again, ten leagues further up Ballenar is situated,\r\nand above this Guasco Alto, a horticultural village, famous for its\r\ndried fruit.  On a clear day the view up the valley is very fine; the\r\nstraight opening terminates in the far-distant snowy Cordillera; on\r\neach side an infinity of crossing-lines are blended together in a\r\nbeautiful haze.  The foreground is singular from the number of parallel\r\nand step-formed terraces; and the included strip of green valley, with\r\nits willow-bushes, is contrasted on both hands with the naked hills.\r\nThat the surrounding country was most barren will be readily believed,\r\nwhen it is known that a shower of rain had not fallen during the last\r\nthirteen months.  The inhabitants heard with the greatest envy of the\r\nrain at Coquimbo; from the appearance of the sky they had hopes of\r\nequally good fortune, which, a fortnight afterwards, were realized.  I\r\nwas at Copiapo at the time; and there the people, with equal envy,\r\ntalked of the abundant rain at Guasco.  After two or three very dry\r\nyears, perhaps with not more than one shower during the whole time, a\r\nrainy year generally follows; and this does more harm than even the\r\ndrought.  The rivers swell, and cover with gravel and sand the narrow\r\nstrips of ground, which alone are fit for cultivation.  The floods also\r\ninjure the irrigating ditches.  Great devastation had thus been caused\r\nthree years ago.\r\n\r\nJune 8th.--We rode on to Ballenar, which takes its name from Ballenagh\r\nin Ireland, the birthplace of the family of O'Higgins, who, under the\r\nSpanish government, were presidents and generals in Chile. As the rocky\r\nmountains on each hand were concealed by clouds, the terrace-like\r\nplains gave to the valley an appearance like that of Santa Cruz in\r\nPatagonia.  After spending one day at Ballenar I set out, on the 10th,\r\nfor the upper part of the valley of Copiapo.  We rode all day over an\r\nuninteresting country.  I am tired of repeating the epithets barren and\r\nsterile.  These words, however, as commonly used, are comparative; I\r\nhave always applied them to the plains of Patagonia, which can boast of\r\nspiny bushes and some tufts of grass; and this is absolute fertility,\r\nas compared with northern Chile.  Here again, there are not many spaces\r\nof two hundred yards square, where some little bush, cactus or lichen,\r\nmay not be discovered by careful examination; and in the soil seeds lie\r\ndormant ready to spring up during the first rainy winter.  In Peru real\r\ndeserts occur over wide tracts of country. In the evening we arrived at\r\na valley, in which the bed of the streamlet was damp: following it up,\r\nwe came to tolerably good water. During the night, the stream, from not\r\nbeing evaporated and absorbed so quickly, flows a league lower down\r\nthan during the day.  Sticks were plentiful for firewood, so that it\r\nwas a good place to bivouac for us; but for the poor animals there was\r\nnot a mouthful to eat.\r\n\r\nJune 11th.--We rode without stopping for twelve hours till we reached\r\nan old smelting-furnace, where there was water and firewood; but our\r\nhorses again had nothing to eat, being shut up in an old courtyard. The\r\nline of road was hilly, and the distant views interesting, from the\r\nvaried colours of the bare mountains.  It was almost a pity to see the\r\nsun shining constantly over so useless a country; such splendid weather\r\nought to have brightened fields and pretty gardens.  The next day we\r\nreached the valley of Copiapo. I was heartily glad of it; for the whole\r\njourney was a continued source of anxiety; it was most disagreeable to\r\nhear, whilst eating our own suppers, our horses gnawing the posts to\r\nwhich they were tied, and to have no means of relieving their hunger.\r\nTo all appearance, however, the animals were quite fresh; and no one\r\ncould have told that they had eaten nothing for the last fifty-five\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nI had a letter of introduction to Mr. Bingley, who received me very\r\nkindly at the Hacienda of Potrero Seco.  This estate is between twenty\r\nand thirty miles long, but very narrow, being generally only two fields\r\nwide, one on each side the river.  In some parts the estate is of no\r\nwidth, that is to say, the land cannot be irrigated, and therefore is\r\nvalueless, like the surrounding rocky desert.  The small quantity of\r\ncultivated land in the whole line of valley, does not so much depend on\r\ninequalities of level, and consequent unfitness for irrigation, as on\r\nthe small supply of water.  The river this year was remarkably full:\r\nhere, high up the valley, it reached to the horse's belly, and was\r\nabout fifteen yards wide, and rapid; lower down it becomes smaller and\r\nsmaller, and is generally quite lost, as happened during one period of\r\nthirty years, so that not a drop entered the sea.  The inhabitants\r\nwatch a storm over the Cordillera with great interest; as one good fall\r\nof snow provides them with water for the ensuing year.  This is of\r\ninfinitely more consequence than rain in the lower country.  Rain, as\r\noften as it falls, which is about once in every two or three years, is\r\na great advantage, because the cattle and mules can for some time\r\nafterwards find a little pasture in the mountains.  But without snow on\r\nthe Andes, desolation extends throughout the valley.  It is on record\r\nthat three times nearly all the inhabitants have been obliged to\r\nemigrate to the south.  This year there was plenty of water, and every\r\nman irrigated his ground as much as he chose; but it has frequently\r\nbeen necessary to post soldiers at the sluices, to see that each estate\r\ntook only its proper allowance during so many hours in the week.  The\r\nvalley is said to contain 12,000 souls, but its produce is sufficient\r\nonly for three months in the year; the rest of the supply being drawn\r\nfrom Valparaiso and the south.  Before the discovery of the famous\r\nsilver-mines of Chanuncillo, Copiapo was in a rapid state of decay; but\r\nnow it is in a very thriving condition; and the town, which was\r\ncompletely overthrown by an earthquake, has been rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Copiapo, forming a mere ribbon of green in a desert, runs\r\nin a very southerly direction; so that it is of considerable length to\r\nits source in the Cordillera.  The valleys of Guasco and Copiapo may\r\nboth be considered as long narrow islands, separated from the rest of\r\nChile by deserts of rock instead of by salt water.  Northward of these,\r\nthere is one other very miserable valley, called Paposo, which contains\r\nabout two hundred souls; and then there extends the real desert of\r\nAtacama--a barrier far worse than the most turbulent ocean.  After\r\nstaying a few days at Potrero Seco, I proceeded up the valley to the\r\nhouse of Don Benito Cruz, to whom I had a letter of introduction.  I\r\nfound him most hospitable; indeed it is impossible to bear too strong\r\ntestimony to the kindness with which travellers are received in almost\r\nevery part of South America.  The next day I hired some mules to take\r\nme by the ravine of Jolquera into the central Cordillera.  On the\r\nsecond night the weather seemed to foretell a storm of snow or rain,\r\nand whilst lying in our beds we felt a trifling shock of an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe connection between earthquakes and the weather has been often\r\ndisputed: it appears to me to be a point of great interest, which is\r\nlittle understood.  Humboldt has remarked in one part of the Personal\r\nNarrative, [1] that it would be difficult for any person who had long\r\nresided in New Andalusia, or in Lower Peru, to deny that there exists\r\nsome connection between these phenomena: in another part, however he\r\nseems to think the connection fanciful.  At Guayaquil it is said that a\r\nheavy shower in the dry season is invariably followed by an earthquake.\r\nIn Northern Chile, from the extreme infrequency of rain, or even of\r\nweather foreboding rain, the probability of accidental coincidences\r\nbecomes very small; yet the inhabitants are here most firmly convinced\r\nof some connection between the state of the atmosphere and of the\r\ntrembling of the ground: I was much struck by this when mentioning to\r\nsome people at Copiapo that there had been a sharp shock at Coquimbo:\r\nthey immediately cried out, \"How fortunate! there will be plenty of\r\npasture there this year.\" To their minds an earthquake foretold rain as\r\nsurely as rain foretold abundant pasture.  Certainly it did so happen\r\nthat on the very day of the earthquake, that shower of rain fell, which\r\nI have described as in ten days' time producing a thin sprinkling of\r\ngrass.  At other times rain has followed earthquakes at a period of the\r\nyear when it is a far greater prodigy than the earthquake itself: this\r\nhappened after the shock of November, 1822, and again in 1829, at\r\nValparaiso; also after that of September, 1833, at Tacna. A person must\r\nbe somewhat habituated to the climate of these countries to perceive\r\nthe extreme improbability of rain falling at such seasons, except as a\r\nconsequence of some law quite unconnected with the ordinary course of\r\nthe weather. In the cases of great volcanic eruptions, as that of\r\nCoseguina, where torrents of rain fell at a time of the year most\r\nunusual for it, and \"almost unprecedented in Central America,\" it is\r\nnot difficult to understand that the volumes of vapour and clouds of\r\nashes might have disturbed the atmospheric equilibrium.  Humboldt\r\nextends this view to the case of earthquakes unaccompanied by\r\neruptions; but I can hardly conceive it possible, that the small\r\nquantity of aeriform fluids which then escape from the fissured ground,\r\ncan produce such remarkable effects.  There appears much probability in\r\nthe view first proposed by Mr. P. Scrope, that when the barometer is\r\nlow, and when rain might naturally be expected to fall, the diminished\r\npressure of the atmosphere over a wide extent of country, might well\r\ndetermine the precise day on which the earth, already stretched to the\r\nutmost by the subterranean forces, should yield, crack, and\r\nconsequently tremble.  It is, however, doubtful how far this idea will\r\nexplain the circumstances of torrents of rain falling in the dry season\r\nduring several days, after an earthquake unaccompanied by an eruption;\r\nsuch cases seem to bespeak some more intimate connection between the\r\natmospheric and subterranean regions.\r\n\r\nFinding little of interest in this part of the ravine, we retraced our\r\nsteps to the house of Don Benito, where I stayed two days collecting\r\nfossil shells and wood.  Great prostrate silicified trunks of trees,\r\nembedded in a conglomerate, were extraordinarily numerous.  I measured\r\none, which was fifteen feet in circumference: how surprising it is that\r\nevery atom of the woody matter in this great cylinder should have been\r\nremoved and replaced by silex so perfectly, that each vessel and pore\r\nis preserved!  These trees flourished at about the period of our lower\r\nchalk; they all belonged to the fir-tribe.  It was amusing to hear the\r\ninhabitants discussing the nature of the fossil shells which I\r\ncollected, almost in the same terms as were used a century ago in\r\nEurope,--namely, whether or not they had been thus \"born by nature.\" My\r\ngeological examination of the country generally created a good deal of\r\nsurprise amongst the Chilenos: it was long before they could be\r\nconvinced that I was not hunting for mines.  This was sometimes\r\ntroublesome: I found the most ready way of explaining my employment,\r\nwas to ask them how it was that they themselves were not curious\r\nconcerning earthquakes and volcanos?--why some springs were hot and\r\nothers cold?--why there were mountains in Chile, and not a hill in La\r\nPlata?  These bare questions at once satisfied and silenced the greater\r\nnumber; some, however (like a few in England who are a century\r\nbehindhand), thought that all such inquiries were useless and impious;\r\nand that it was quite sufficient that God had thus made the mountains.\r\n\r\nAn order had recently been issued that all stray dogs should be killed,\r\nand we saw many lying dead on the road.  A great number had lately gone\r\nmad, and several men had been bitten and had died in consequence.  On\r\nseveral occasions hydrophobia has prevailed in this valley.  It is\r\nremarkable thus to find so strange and dreadful a disease, appearing\r\ntime after time in the same isolated spot.  It has been remarked that\r\ncertain villages in England are in like manner much more subject to\r\nthis visitation than others.  Dr. Unanue states that hydrophobia was\r\nfirst known in South America in 1803: this statement is corroborated by\r\nAzara and Ulloa having never heard of it in their time.  Dr. Unanue\r\nsays that it broke out in Central America, and slowly travelled\r\nsouthward.  It reached Arequipa in 1807; and it is said that some men\r\nthere, who had not been bitten, were affected, as were some negroes,\r\nwho had eaten a bullock which had died of hydrophobia.  At Ica\r\nforty-two people thus miserably perished.  The disease came on between\r\ntwelve and ninety days after the bite; and in those cases where it did\r\ncome on, death ensued invariably within five days.  After 1808, a long\r\ninterval ensued without any cases.  On inquiry, I did not hear of\r\nhydrophobia in Van Diemen's Land, or in Australia; and Burchell says,\r\nthat during the five years he was at the Cape of Good Hope, he never\r\nheard of an instance of it.  Webster asserts that at the Azores\r\nhydrophobia has never occurred; and the same assertion has been made\r\nwith respect to Mauritius and St. Helena. [2] In so strange a disease\r\nsome information might possibly be gained by considering the\r\ncircumstances under which it originates in distant climates; for it is\r\nimprobable that a dog already bitten, should have been brought to these\r\ndistant countries.\r\n\r\nAt night, a stranger arrived at the house of Don Benito, and asked\r\npermission to sleep there.  He said he had been wandering about the\r\nmountains for seventeen days, having lost his way.  He started from\r\nGuasco, and being accustomed to travelling in the Cordillera, did not\r\nexpect any difficulty in following the track to Copiapo; but he soon\r\nbecame involved in a labyrinth of mountains, whence he could not\r\nescape.  Some of his mules had fallen over precipices, and he had been\r\nin great distress.  His chief difficulty arose from not knowing where\r\nto find water in the lower country, so that he was obliged to keep\r\nbordering the central ranges.\r\n\r\nWe returned down the valley, and on the 22nd reached the town of\r\nCopiapo.  The lower part of the valley is broad, forming a fine plain\r\nlike that of Quillota.  The town covers a considerable space of ground,\r\neach house possessing a garden: but it is an uncomfortable place, and\r\nthe dwellings are poorly furnished.  Every one seems bent on the one\r\nobject of making money, and then migrating as quickly as possible. All\r\nthe inhabitants are more or less directly concerned with mines; and\r\nmines and ores are the sole subjects of conversation. Necessaries of\r\nall sorts are extremely dear; as the distance from the town to the port\r\nis eighteen leagues, and the land carriage very expensive.  A fowl\r\ncosts five or six shillings; meat is nearly as dear as in England;\r\nfirewood, or rather sticks, are brought on donkeys from a distance of\r\ntwo and three days' journey within the Cordillera; and pasturage for\r\nanimals is a shilling a day: all this for South America is wonderfully\r\nexorbitant.\r\n\r\n\r\nJune 26th.--I hired a guide and eight mules to take me into the\r\nCordillera by a different line from my last excursion. As the country\r\nwas utterly desert, we took a cargo and a half of barley mixed with\r\nchopped straw.  About two leagues above the town a broad valley called\r\nthe \"Despoblado,\" or uninhabited, branches off from that one by which\r\nwe had arrived.  Although a valley of the grandest dimensions, and\r\nleading to a pass across the Cordillera, yet it is completely dry,\r\nexcepting perhaps for a few days during some very rainy winter.  The\r\nsides of the crumbling mountains were furrowed by scarcely any ravines;\r\nand the bottom of the main valley, filled with shingle, was smooth and\r\nnearly level.  No considerable torrent could ever have flowed down this\r\nbed of shingle; for if it had, a great cliff-bounded channel, as in all\r\nthe southern valleys, would assuredly have been formed.  I feel little\r\ndoubt that this valley, as well as those mentioned by travellers in\r\nPeru, were left in the state we now see them by the waves of the sea,\r\nas the land slowly rose.  I observed in one place, where the Despoblado\r\nwas joined by a ravine (which in almost any other chain would have been\r\ncalled a grand valley), that its bed, though composed merely of sand\r\nand gravel, was higher than that of its tributary. A mere rivulet of\r\nwater, in the course of an hour, would have cut a channel for itself;\r\nbut it was evident that ages had passed away, and no such rivulet had\r\ndrained this great tributary.  It was curious to behold the machinery,\r\nif such a term may be used, for the drainage, all, with the last\r\ntrifling exception, perfect, yet without any signs of action.  Every\r\none must have remarked how mud-banks, left by the retiring tide,\r\nimitate in miniature a country with hill and dale; and here we have the\r\noriginal model in rock, formed as the continent rose during the secular\r\nretirement of the ocean, instead of during the ebbing and flowing of\r\nthe tides.  If a shower of rain falls on the mud-bank, when left dry,\r\nit deepens the already-formed shallow lines of excavation; and so it is\r\nwith the rain of successive centuries on the bank of rock and soil,\r\nwhich we call a continent.\r\n\r\nWe rode on after it was dark, till we reached a side ravine with a\r\nsmall well, called \"Agua amarga.\" The water deserved its name, for\r\nbesides being saline it was most offensively putrid and bitter; so that\r\nwe could not force ourselves to drink either tea or mate.  I suppose\r\nthe distance from the river of Copiapo to this spot was at least\r\ntwenty-five or thirty English miles; in the whole space there was not a\r\nsingle drop of water, the country deserving the name of desert in the\r\nstrictest sense.  Yet about half way we passed some old Indian ruins\r\nnear Punta Gorda: I noticed also in front of some of the valleys, which\r\nbranch off from the Despoblado, two piles of stones placed a little way\r\napart, and directed so as to point up the mouths of these small\r\nvalleys.  My companions knew nothing about them, and only answered my\r\nqueries by their imperturbable \"quien sabe?\"\r\n\r\nI observed Indian ruins in several parts of the Cordillera: the most\r\nperfect which I saw, were the Ruinas de Tambillos, in the Uspallata\r\nPass.  Small square rooms were there huddled together in separate\r\ngroups: some of the doorways were yet standing; they were formed by a\r\ncross slab of stone only about three feet high.  Ulloa has remarked on\r\nthe lowness of the doors in the ancient Peruvian dwellings.  These\r\nhouses, when perfect, must have been capable of containing a\r\nconsiderable number of persons.  Tradition says, that they were used as\r\nhalting-places for the Incas, when they crossed the mountains.  Traces\r\nof Indian habitations have been discovered in many other parts, where\r\nit does not appear probable that they were used as mere resting-places,\r\nbut yet where the land is as utterly unfit for any kind of cultivation,\r\nas it is near the Tambillos or at the Incas Bridge, or in the Portillo\r\nPass, at all which places I saw ruins.  In the ravine of Jajuel, near\r\nAconcagua, where there is no pass, I heard of remains of houses\r\nsituated at a great height, where it is extremely cold and sterile.  At\r\nfirst I imagined that these buildings had been places of refuge, built\r\nby the Indians on the first arrival of the Spaniards; but I have since\r\nbeen inclined to speculate on the probability of a small change of\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nIn this northern part of Chile, within the Cordillera, old Indian\r\nhouses are said to be especially numerous: by digging amongst the\r\nruins, bits of woollen articles, instruments of precious metals, and\r\nheads of Indian corn, are not unfrequently discovered: an arrow-head\r\nmade of agate, and of precisely the same form with those now used in\r\nTierra del Fuego, was given me.  I am aware that the Peruvian Indians\r\nnow frequently inhabit most lofty and bleak situations; but at Copiapo\r\nI was assured by men who had spent their lives in travelling through\r\nthe Andes, that there were very many (muchisimas)  buildings at heights\r\nso great as almost to border upon the perpetual snow, and in parts\r\nwhere there exist no passes, and where the land produces absolutely\r\nnothing, and what is still more extraordinary, where there is no water.\r\nNevertheless it is the opinion of the people of the country (although\r\nthey are much puzzled by the circumstance), that, from the appearance\r\nof the houses, the Indians must have used them as places of residence.\r\nIn this valley, at Punta Gorda, the remains consisted of seven or eight\r\nsquare little rooms, which were of a similar form with those at\r\nTambillos, but built chiefly of mud, which the present inhabitants\r\ncannot, either here or, according to Ulloa, in Peru, imitate in\r\ndurability.  They were situated in the most conspicuous and defenceless\r\nposition, at the bottom of the flat broad valley. There was no water\r\nnearer than three or four leagues, and that only in very small\r\nquantity, and bad: the soil was absolutely sterile; I looked in vain\r\neven for a lichen adhering to the rocks.  At the present day, with the\r\nadvantage of beasts of burden, a mine, unless it were very rich, could\r\nscarcely be worked here with profit.  Yet the Indians formerly chose it\r\nas a place of residence!  If at the present time two or three showers\r\nof rain were to fall annually, instead of one, as now is the case\r\nduring as many years, a small rill of water would probably be formed in\r\nthis great valley; and then, by irrigation (which was formerly so well\r\nunderstood by the Indians), the soil would easily be rendered\r\nsufficiently productive to support a few families.\r\n\r\nI have convincing proofs that this part of the continent of South\r\nAmerica has been elevated near the coast at least from 400 to 500, and\r\nin some parts from 1000 to 1300 feet, since the epoch of existing\r\nshells; and further inland the rise possibly may have been greater.  As\r\nthe peculiarly arid character of the climate is evidently a consequence\r\nof the height of the Cordillera, we may feel almost sure that before\r\nthe later elevations, the atmosphere could not have been so completely\r\ndrained of its moisture as it now is; and as the rise has been gradual,\r\nso would have been the change in climate.  On this notion of a change\r\nof climate since the buildings were inhabited, the ruins must be of\r\nextreme antiquity, but I do not think their preservation under the\r\nChilian climate any great difficulty.  We must also admit on this\r\nnotion (and this perhaps is a greater difficulty) that man has\r\ninhabited South America for an immensely long period, inasmuch as any\r\nchange of climate effected by the elevation of the land must have been\r\nextremely gradual.  At Valparaiso, within the last 220 years, the rise\r\nhas been somewhat less than 19 feet: at Lima a sea-beach has certainly\r\nbeen upheaved from 80 to 90 feet, within the Indo-human period: but\r\nsuch small elevations could have had little power in deflecting the\r\nmoisture-bringing atmospheric currents.  Dr. Lund, however, found human\r\nskeletons in the caves of Brazil, the appearance of which induced him\r\nto believe that the Indian race has existed during a vast lapse of time\r\nin South America.\r\n\r\nWhen at Lima, I conversed on these subjects [3] with Mr. Gill, a civil\r\nengineer, who had seen much of the interior country.  He told me that a\r\nconjecture of a change of climate had sometimes crossed his mind; but\r\nthat he thought that the greater portion of land, now incapable of\r\ncultivation, but covered with Indian ruins, had been reduced to this\r\nstate by the water-conduits, which the Indians formerly constructed on\r\nso wonderful a scale, having been injured by neglect and by\r\nsubterranean movements.  I may here mention, that the Peruvians\r\nactually carried their irrigating streams in tunnels through hills of\r\nsolid rock.  Mr. Gill told me, he had been employed professionally to\r\nexamine one: he found the passage low, narrow, crooked, and not of\r\nuniform breadth, but of very considerable length.  Is it not most\r\nwonderful that men should have attempted such operations, without the\r\nuse of iron or gunpowder?  Mr. Gill also mentioned to me a most\r\ninteresting, and, as far as I am aware, quite unparalleled case, of a\r\nsubterranean disturbance having changed the drainage of a country.\r\nTravelling from Casma to Huaraz (not very far distant from Lima), he\r\nfound a plain covered with ruins and marks of ancient cultivation but\r\nnow quite barren.  Near it was the dry course of a considerable river,\r\nwhence the water for irrigation had formerly been conducted.  There was\r\nnothing in the appearance of the water-course to indicate that the\r\nriver had not flowed there a few years previously; in some parts, beds\r\nof sand and gravel were spread out; in others, the solid rock had been\r\nworn into a broad channel, which in one spot was about 40 yards in\r\nbreadth and 8 feet deep.  It is self-evident that a person following up\r\nthe course of a stream, will always ascend at a greater or less\r\ninclination: Mr. Gill, therefore, was much astonished, when walking up\r\nthe bed of this ancient river, to find himself suddenly going down\r\nhill.  He imagined that the downward slope had a fall of about 40 or 50\r\nfeet perpendicular.  We here have unequivocal evidence that a ridge had\r\nbeen uplifted right across the old bed of a stream.  From the moment\r\nthe river-course was thus arched, the water must necessarily have been\r\nthrown back, and a new channel formed.  From that moment, also, the\r\nneighbouring plain must have lost its fertilizing stream, and become a\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nJune 27th.--We set out early in the morning, and by midday reached the\r\nravine of Paypote, where there is a tiny rill of water, with a little\r\nvegetation, and even a few algarroba trees, a kind of mimosa. From\r\nhaving firewood, a smelting-furnace had formerly been built here: we\r\nfound a solitary man in charge of it, whose sole employment was hunting\r\nguanacos.  At night it froze sharply; but having plenty of wood for our\r\nfire, we kept ourselves warm.\r\n\r\n28th.--We continued gradually ascending, and the valley now changed\r\ninto a ravine.  During the day we saw several guanacos, and the track\r\nof the closely-allied species, the Vicuna: this latter animal is\r\npre-eminently alpine in its habits; it seldom descends much below the\r\nlimit of perpetual snow, and therefore haunts even a more lofty and\r\nsterile situation than the guanaco.  The only other animal which we saw\r\nin any number was a small fox: I suppose this animal preys on the mice\r\nand other small rodents, which, as long as there is the least\r\nvegetation, subsist in considerable numbers in very desert places.  In\r\nPatagonia, even on the borders of the salinas, where a drop of fresh\r\nwater can never be found, excepting dew, these little animals swarm.\r\nNext to lizards, mice appear to be able to support existence on the\r\nsmallest and driest portions of the earth--even on islets in the midst\r\nof great oceans.\r\n\r\nThe scene on all sides showed desolation, brightened and made palpable\r\nby a clear, unclouded sky.  For a time such scenery is sublime, but\r\nthis feeling cannot last, and then it becomes uninteresting.  We\r\nbivouacked at the foot of the \"primera linea,\" or the first line of the\r\npartition of waters. The streams, however, on the east side do not flow\r\nto the Atlantic, but into an elevated district, in the middle of which\r\nthere is a large saline, or salt lake; thus forming a little Caspian\r\nSea at the height, perhaps, of ten thousand feet.  Where we slept,\r\nthere were some considerable patches of snow, but they do not remain\r\nthroughout the year.  The winds in these lofty regions obey very\r\nregular laws. Every day a fresh breeze blows up the valley, and at\r\nnight, an hour or two after sunset, the air from the cold regions above\r\ndescends as through a funnel.  This night it blew a gale of wind, and\r\nthe temperature must have been considerably below the freezing-point,\r\nfor water in a vessel soon became a block of ice.  No clothes seemed to\r\npose any obstacle to the air; I suffered very much from the cold, so\r\nthat I could not sleep, and in the morning rose with my body quite dull\r\nand benumbed.\r\n\r\nIn the Cordillera further southward, people lose their lives from\r\nsnow-storms; here, it sometimes happens from another cause.  My guide,\r\nwhen a boy of fourteen years old, was passing the Cordillera with a\r\nparty in the month of May; and while in the central parts, a furious\r\ngale of wind arose, so that the men could hardly cling on their mules,\r\nand stones were flying along the ground.  The day was cloudless, and\r\nnot a speck of snow fell, but the temperature was low.  It is probable\r\nthat the thermometer could not have stood very many degrees below the\r\nfreezing-point, but the effect on their bodies, ill protected by\r\nclothing, must have been in proportion to the rapidity of the current\r\nof cold air.  The gale lasted for more than a day; the men began to\r\nlose their strength, and the mules would not move onwards.  My guide's\r\nbrother tried to return, but he perished, and his body was found two\r\nyears afterwards. Lying by the side of his mule near the road, with the\r\nbridle still in his hand.  Two other men in the party lost their\r\nfingers and toes; and out of two hundred mules and thirty cows, only\r\nfourteen mules escaped alive.  Many years ago the whole of a large\r\nparty are supposed to have perished from a similar cause, but their\r\nbodies to this day have never been discovered.  The union of a\r\ncloudless sky, low temperature, and a furious gale of wind, must be, I\r\nshould think, in all parts of the world an unusual occurrence.\r\n\r\nJune 29th--We gladly travelled down the valley to our former night's\r\nlodging, and thence to near the Agua amarga. On July 1st we reached the\r\nvalley of Copiapo.  The smell of the fresh clover was quite delightful,\r\nafter the scentless air of the dry, sterile Despoblado.  Whilst staying\r\nin the town I heard an account from several of the inhabitants, of a\r\nhill in the neighbourhood which they called \"El Bramador,\"--the roarer\r\nor bellower.  I did not at the time pay sufficient attention to the\r\naccount; but, as far as I understood, the hill was covered by sand, and\r\nthe noise was produced only when people, by ascending it, put the sand\r\nin motion.  The same circumstances are described in detail on the\r\nauthority of Seetzen and Ehrenberg, [4] as the cause of the sounds\r\nwhich have been heard by many travellers on Mount Sinai near the Red\r\nSea.  One person with whom I conversed had himself heard the noise: he\r\ndescribed it as very surprising; and he distinctly stated that,\r\nalthough he could not understand how it was caused, yet it was\r\nnecessary to set the sand rolling down the acclivity.  A horse walking\r\nover dry coarse sand, causes a peculiar chirping noise from the\r\nfriction of the particles; a circumstance which I several times noticed\r\non the coast of Brazil.\r\n\r\nThree days afterwards I heard of the Beagle's arrival at the Port,\r\ndistant eighteen leagues from the town.  There is very little land\r\ncultivated down the valley; its wide expanse supports a wretched wiry\r\ngrass, which even the donkeys can hardly eat.  This poorness of the\r\nvegetation is owing to the quantity of saline matter with which the\r\nsoil is impregnated. The Port consists of an assemblage of miserable\r\nlittle hovels, situated at the foot of a sterile plain.  At present, as\r\nthe river contains water enough to reach the sea, the inhabitants enjoy\r\nthe advantage of having fresh water within a mile and a half.  On the\r\nbeach there were large piles of merchandise, and the little place had\r\nan air of activity.  In the evening I gave my adios, with a hearty\r\ngood-will, to my companion Mariano Gonzales, with whom I had ridden so\r\nmany leagues in Chile.  The next morning the Beagle sailed for Iquique.\r\n\r\nJuly 12th.--We anchored in the port of Iquique, in lat. 20 degs. 12',\r\non the coast of Peru.  The town contains about a thousand inhabitants,\r\nand stands on a little plain of sand at the foot of a great wall of\r\nrock, 2000 feet in height, here forming the coast.  The whole is\r\nutterly desert.  A light shower of rain falls only once in very many\r\nyears; and the ravines consequently are filled with detritus, and the\r\nmountain-sides covered by piles of fine white sand, even to a height of\r\na thousand feet.  During this season of the year a heavy bank of\r\nclouds, stretched over the ocean, seldom rises above the wall of rocks\r\non the coast.  The aspect of the place was most gloomy; the little\r\nport, with its few vessels, and small group of wretched houses, seemed\r\noverwhelmed and out of all proportion with the rest of the scene.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants live like persons on board a ship: every necessary\r\ncomes from a distance: water is brought in boats from Pisagua, about\r\nforty miles northward, and is sold at the rate of nine reals (4s. 6d.)\r\nan eighteen-gallon cask: I bought a wine-bottle full for threepence. In\r\nlike manner firewood, and of course every article of food, is imported.\r\nVery few animals can be maintained in such a place: on the ensuing\r\nmorning I hired with difficulty, at the price of four pounds sterling,\r\ntwo mules and a guide to take me to the nitrate of soda works.  These\r\nare at present the support of Iquique.  This salt was first exported in\r\n1830: in one year an amount in value of one hundred thousand pounds\r\nsterling, was sent to France and England.  It is principally used as a\r\nmanure and in the manufacture of nitric acid: owing to its deliquescent\r\nproperty it will not serve for gunpowder. Formerly there were two\r\nexceedingly rich silver-mines in this neighbourhood, but their produce\r\nis now very small.\r\n\r\nOur arrival in the offing caused some little apprehension. Peru was in\r\na state of anarchy; and each party having demanded a contribution, the\r\npoor town of Iquique was in tribulation, thinking the evil hour was\r\ncome.  The people had also their domestic troubles; a short time\r\nbefore, three French carpenters had broken open, during the same night,\r\nthe two churches, and stolen all the plate: one of the robbers,\r\nhowever, subsequently confessed, and the plate was recovered. The\r\nconvicts were sent to Arequipa, which though the capital of this\r\nprovince, is two hundred leagues distant, the government there thought\r\nit a pity to punish such useful workmen, who could make all sorts of\r\nfurniture; and accordingly liberated them.  Things being in this state,\r\nthe churches were again broken open, but this time the plate was not\r\nrecovered. The inhabitants became dreadfully enraged, and declaring\r\nthat none but heretics would thus \"eat God Almighty,\" proceeded to\r\ntorture some Englishmen, with the intention of afterwards shooting\r\nthem.  At last the authorities interfered, and peace was established.\r\n\r\n\r\n13th.--In the morning I started for the saltpetre-works, a distance of\r\nfourteen leagues.  Having ascended the steep coast-mountains by a\r\nzigzag sandy track, we soon came in view of the mines of Guantajaya and\r\nSt. Rosa.  These two small villages are placed at the very mouths of\r\nthe mines; and being perched up on hills, they had a still more\r\nunnatural and desolate appearance than the town of Iquique.  We did not\r\nreach the saltpetre-works till after sunset, having ridden all day\r\nacross an undulating country, a complete and utter desert.  The road\r\nwas strewed with the bones and dried skins of many beasts of burden\r\nwhich had perished on it from fatigue.  Excepting the Vultur aura,\r\nwhich preys on the carcasses, I saw neither bird, quadruped, reptile,\r\nnor insect. On the coast-mountains, at the height of about 2000 feet\r\nwhere during this season the clouds generally hang, a very few cacti\r\nwere growing in the clefts of rock; and the loose sand was strewed over\r\nwith a lichen, which lies on the surface quite unattached.  This plant\r\nbelongs to the genus Cladonia, and somewhat resembles the reindeer\r\nlichen.  In some parts it was in sufficient quantity to tinge the sand,\r\nas seen from a distance, of a pale yellowish colour.  Further inland,\r\nduring the whole ride of fourteen leagues, I saw only one other\r\nvegetable production, and that was a most minute yellow lichen, growing\r\non the bones of the dead mules.  This was the first true desert which I\r\nhad seen: the effect on me was not impressive; but I believe this was\r\nowing to my having become gradually accustomed to such scenes, as I\r\nrode northward from Valparaiso, through Coquimbo, to Copiapo. The\r\nappearance of the country was remarkable, from being covered by a thick\r\ncrust of common salt, and of a stratified saliferous alluvium, which\r\nseems to have been deposited as the land slowly rose above the level of\r\nthe sea. The salt is white, very hard, and compact: it occurs in water\r\nworn nodules projecting from the agglutinated sand, and is associated\r\nwith much gypsum.  The appearance of this superficial mass very closely\r\nresembled that of a country after snow, before the last dirty patches\r\nare thawed.  The existence of this crust of a soluble substance over\r\nthe whole face of the country, shows how extraordinarily dry the\r\nclimate must have been for a long period.\r\n\r\nAt night I slept at the house of the owner of one of the saltpetre\r\nmines.  The country is here as unproductive as near the coast; but\r\nwater, having rather a bitter and brackish taste, can be procured by\r\ndigging wells.  The well at this house was thirty-six yards deep: as\r\nscarcely any rain falls, it is evident the water is not thus derived;\r\nindeed if it were, it could not fail to be as salt as brine, for the\r\nwhole surrounding country is incrusted with various saline substances.\r\nWe must therefore conclude that it percolates under ground from the\r\nCordillera, though distant many leagues.  In that direction there are a\r\nfew small villages, where the inhabitants, having more water, are\r\nenabled to irrigate a little land, and raise hay, on which the mules\r\nand asses, employed in carrying the saltpetre, are fed.  The nitrate of\r\nsoda was now selling at the ship's side at fourteen shillings per\r\nhundred pounds: the chief expense is its transport to the sea-coast.\r\nThe mine consists of a hard stratum, between two and three feet thick,\r\nof the nitrate mingled with a little of the sulphate of soda and a good\r\ndeal of common salt.  It lies close beneath the surface, and follows\r\nfor a length of one hundred and fifty miles the margin of a grand basin\r\nor plain; this, from its outline, manifestly must once have been a\r\nlake, or more probably an inland arm of the sea, as may be inferred\r\nfrom the presence of iodic salts in the saline stratum.  The surface of\r\nthe plain is 3300 feet above the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n19th.--We anchored in the Bay of Callao, the seaport of Lima, the\r\ncapital of Peru.  We stayed here six weeks but from the troubled state\r\nof public affairs, I saw very little of the country.  During our whole\r\nvisit the climate was far from being so delightful, as it is generally\r\nrepresented.  A dull heavy bank of clouds constantly hung over the\r\nland, so that during the first sixteen days I had only one view of the\r\nCordillera behind Lima.  These mountains, seen in stages, one above the\r\nother, through openings in the clouds, had a very grand appearance.  It\r\nis almost become a proverb, that rain never falls in the lower part of\r\nPeru.  Yet this can hardly be considered correct; for during almost\r\nevery day of our visit there was a thick drizzling mist, which was\r\nsufficient to make the streets muddy and one's clothes damp: this the\r\npeople are pleased to call Peruvian dew.  That much rain does not fall\r\nis very certain, for the houses are covered only with flat roofs made\r\nof hardened mud; and on the mole shiploads of wheat were piled up,\r\nbeing thus left for weeks together without any shelter.\r\n\r\nI cannot say I liked the very little I saw of Peru: in summer, however,\r\nit is said that the climate is much pleasanter. In all seasons, both\r\ninhabitants and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague.  This\r\ndisease is common on the whole coast of Peru, but is unknown in the\r\ninterior.  The attacks of illness which arise from miasma never fail to\r\nappear most mysterious.  So difficult is it to judge from the aspect of\r\na country, whether or not it is healthy, that if a person had been told\r\nto choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for\r\nhealth, very probably he would have named this coast.  The plain round\r\nthe outskirts of Callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass, and\r\nin some parts there are a few stagnant, though very small, pools of\r\nwater.  The miasma, in all probability, arises from these: for the town\r\nof Arica was similarly circumstanced, and its healthiness was much\r\nimproved by the drainage of some little pools.  Miasma is not always\r\nproduced by a luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate; for many\r\nparts of Brazil, even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation,\r\nare much more healthy than this sterile coast of Peru.  The densest\r\nforests in a temperate climate, as in Chiloe, do not seem in the\r\nslightest degree to affect the healthy condition of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe island of St. Jago, at the Cape de Verds, offers another strongly\r\nmarked instance of a country, which any one would have expected to find\r\nmost healthy, being very much the contrary.  I have described the bare\r\nand open plains as supporting, during a few weeks after the rainy\r\nseason, a thin vegetation, which directly withers away and dries up: at\r\nthis period the air appears to become quite poisonous; both natives and\r\nforeigners often being affected with violent fevers. On the other hand,\r\nthe Galapagos Archipelago, in the Pacific, with a similar soil, and\r\nperiodically subject to the same process of vegetation, is perfectly\r\nhealthy.  Humboldt has observed, that, \"under the torrid zone, the\r\nsmallest marshes are the most dangerous, being surrounded, as at Vera\r\nCruz and Carthagena, with an arid and sandy soil, which raises the\r\ntemperature of the ambient air.\" [5] On the coast of Peru, however, the\r\ntemperature is not hot to any excessive degree; and perhaps in\r\nconsequence, the intermittent fevers are not of the most malignant\r\norder.  In all unhealthy countries the greatest risk is run by sleeping\r\non shore.  Is this owing to the state of the body during sleep, or to a\r\ngreater abundance of miasma at such times?  It appears certain that\r\nthose who stay on board a vessel, though anchored at only a short\r\ndistance from the coast, generally suffer less than those actually on\r\nshore.  On the other hand, I have heard of one remarkable case where a\r\nfever broke out among the crew of a man-of-war some hundred miles off\r\nthe coast of Africa, and at the same time one of those fearful periods\r\n[6] of death commenced at Sierra Leone.\r\n\r\nNo state in South America, since the declaration of independence, has\r\nsuffered more from anarchy than Peru.  At the time of our visit, there\r\nwere four chiefs in arms contending for supremacy in the government: if\r\none succeeded in becoming for a time very powerful, the others\r\ncoalesced against him; but no sooner were they victorious, than they\r\nwere again hostile to each other.  The other day, at the Anniversary of\r\nthe Independence, high mass was performed, the President partaking of\r\nthe sacrament: during the _Te Deum laudamus_, instead of each regiment\r\ndisplaying the Peruvian flag, a black one with death's head was\r\nunfurled.  Imagine a government under which such a scene could be\r\nordered, on such an occasion, to be typical of their determination of\r\nfighting to death!  This state of affairs happened at a time very\r\nunfortunately for me, as I was precluded from taking any excursions\r\nmuch beyond the limits of the town.  The barren island of St. Lorenzo,\r\nwhich forms the harbour, was nearly the only place where one could walk\r\nsecurely.  The upper part, which is upwards of 1000 feet in height,\r\nduring this season of the year (winter), comes within the lower limit\r\nof the clouds; and in consequence, an abundant cryptogamic vegetation,\r\nand a few flowers cover the summit.  On the hills near Lima, at a\r\nheight but little greater, the ground is carpeted with moss, and beds\r\nof beautiful yellow lilies, called Amancaes.  This indicates a very\r\nmuch greater degree of humidity, than at a corresponding height at\r\nIquique. Proceeding northward of Lima, the climate becomes damper, till\r\non the banks of the Guayaquil, nearly under the equator, we find the\r\nmost luxuriant forests.  The change, however, from the sterile coast of\r\nPeru to that fertile land is described as taking place rather abruptly\r\nin the latitude of Cape Blanco, two degrees south of Guayaquil.\r\n\r\nCallao is a filthy, ill-built, small seaport.  The inhabitants, both\r\nhere and at Lima, present every imaginable shade of mixture, between\r\nEuropean, Negro, and Indian blood.  They appear a depraved, drunken set\r\nof people.  The atmosphere is loaded with foul smells, and that\r\npeculiar one, which may be perceived in almost every town within the\r\ntropics, was here very strong.  The fortress, which withstood Lord\r\nCochrane's long siege, has an imposing appearance.  But the President,\r\nduring our stay, sold the brass guns, and proceeded to dismantle parts\r\nof it.  The reason assigned was, that he had not an officer to whom he\r\ncould trust so important a charge.  He himself had good reason for\r\nthinking so, as he had obtained the presidentship by rebelling while in\r\ncharge of this same fortress.  After we left South America, he paid the\r\npenalty in the usual manner, by being conquered, taken prisoner, and\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nLima stands on a plain in a valley, formed during the gradual retreat\r\nof the sea.  It is seven miles from Callao, and is elevated 500 feet\r\nabove it; but from the slope being very gradual, the road appears\r\nabsolutely level; so that when at Lima it is difficult to believe one\r\nhas ascended even one hundred feet: Humboldt has remarked on this\r\nsingularly deceptive case.  Steep barren hills rise like islands from\r\nthe plain, which is divided, by straight mud-walls, into large green\r\nfields.  In these scarcely a tree grows excepting a few willows, and an\r\noccasional clump of bananas and of oranges. The city of Lima is now in\r\na wretched state of decay: the streets are nearly unpaved; and heaps of\r\nfilth are piled up in all directions, where the black gallinazos, tame\r\nas poultry, pick up bits of carrion.  The houses have generally an\r\nupper story, built on account of the earthquakes, of plastered woodwork\r\nbut some of the old ones, which are now used by several families, are\r\nimmensely large, and would rival in suites of apartments the most\r\nmagnificent in any place.  Lima, the City of the Kings, must formerly\r\nhave been a splendid town. The extraordinary number of churches gives\r\nit, even at the present day, a peculiar and striking character,\r\nespecially when viewed from a short distance.\r\n\r\nOne day I went out with some merchants to hunt in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the city.  Our sport was very poor; but I had an\r\nopportunity of seeing the ruins of one of the ancient Indian villages,\r\nwith its mound like a natural hill in the centre.  The remains of\r\nhouses, enclosures, irrigating streams, and burial mounds, scattered\r\nover this plain, cannot fail to give one a high idea of the condition\r\nand number of the ancient population.  When their earthenware, woollen\r\nclothes, utensils of elegant forms cut out of the hardest rocks, tools\r\nof copper, ornaments of precious stones, palaces, and hydraulic works,\r\nare considered, it is impossible not to respect the considerable\r\nadvance made by them in the arts of civilization.  The burial mounds,\r\ncalled Huacas, are really stupendous; although in some places they\r\nappear to be natural hills incased and modelled.\r\n\r\nThere is also another and very different class of ruins, which\r\npossesses some interest, namely, those of old Callao, overwhelmed by\r\nthe great earthquake of 1746, and its accompanying wave.  The\r\ndestruction must have been more complete even than at Talcahuano.\r\nQuantities of shingle almost conceal the foundations of the walls, and\r\nvast masses of brickwork appear to have been whirled about like pebbles\r\nby the retiring waves.  It has been stated that the land subsided\r\nduring this memorable shock: I could not discover any proof of this;\r\nyet it seems far from improbable, for the form of the coast must\r\ncertainly have undergone some change since the foundation of the old\r\ntown; as no people in their senses would willingly have chosen for\r\ntheir building place, the narrow spit of shingle on which the ruins now\r\nstand. Since our voyage, M. Tschudi has come to the conclusion, by the\r\ncomparison of old and modern maps, that the coast both north and south\r\nof Lima has certainly subsided.\r\n\r\nOn the island of San Lorenzo, there are very satisfactory proofs of\r\nelevation within the recent period; this of course is not opposed to\r\nthe belief, of a small sinking of the ground having subsequently taken\r\nplace.  The side of this island fronting the Bay of Callao, is worn\r\ninto three obscure terraces, the lower one of which is covered by a bed\r\na mile in length, almost wholly composed of shells of eighteen species,\r\nnow living in the adjoining sea.  The height of this bed is eighty-five\r\nfeet.  Many of the shells are deeply corroded, and have a much older\r\nand more decayed appearance than those at the height of 500 or 600 feet\r\non the coast of Chile.  These shells are associated with much common\r\nsalt, a little sulphate of lime (both probably left by the evaporation\r\nof the spray, as the land slowly rose), together with sulphate of soda\r\nand muriate of lime.  They rest on fragments of the underlying\r\nsandstone, and are covered by a few inches thick of detritus.  The\r\nshells, higher up on this terrace could be traced scaling off in\r\nflakes, and falling into an impalpable powder; and on an upper terrace,\r\nat the height of 170 feet, and likewise at some considerably higher\r\npoints, I found a layer of saline powder of exactly similar appearance,\r\nand lying in the same relative position.  I have no doubt that this\r\nupper layer originally existed as a bed of shells, like that on the\r\neighty-five-feet ledge; but it does not now contain even a trace of\r\norganic structure.  The powder has been analyzed for me by Mr. T.\r\nReeks; it consists of sulphates and muriates both of lime and soda,\r\nwith very little carbonate of lime.  It is known that common salt and\r\ncarbonate of lime left in a mass for some time together, partly\r\ndecompose each other; though this does not happen with small quantities\r\nin solution.  As the half-decomposed shells in the lower parts are\r\nassociated with much common salt, together with some of the saline\r\nsubstances composing the upper saline layer, and as these shells are\r\ncorroded and decayed in a remarkable manner, I strongly suspect that\r\nthis double decomposition has here taken place.  The resultant salts,\r\nhowever, ought to be carbonate of soda and muriate of lime, the latter\r\nis present, but not the carbonate of soda.  Hence I am led to imagine\r\nthat by some unexplained means, the carbonate of soda becomes changed\r\ninto the sulphate.  It is obvious that the saline layer could not have\r\nbeen preserved in any country in which abundant rain occasionally fell:\r\non the other hand, this very circumstance, which at first sight appears\r\nso highly favourable to the long preservation of exposed shells, has\r\nprobably been the indirect means, through the common salt not having\r\nbeen washed away, of their decomposition and early decay.\r\n\r\nI was much interested by finding on the terrace, at the height of\r\neighty-five feet, _embedded_  amidst the shells and much sea-drifted\r\nrubbish, some bits of cotton thread, plaited rush, and the head of a\r\nstalk of Indian corn: I compared these relics with similar ones taken\r\nout of the Huacas, or old Peruvian tombs, and found them identical in\r\nappearance. On the mainland in front of San Lorenzo, near Bellavista,\r\nthere is an extensive and level plain about a hundred feet high, of\r\nwhich the lower part is formed of alternating layers of sand and impure\r\nclay, together with some gravel, and the surface, to the depth of from\r\nthree to six feet, of a reddish loam, containing a few scattered\r\nsea-shells and numerous small fragments of coarse red earthenware, more\r\nabundant at certain spots than at others.  At first I was inclined to\r\nbelieve that this superficial bed, from its wide extent and smoothness,\r\nmust have been deposited beneath the sea; but I afterwards found in one\r\nspot, that it lay on an artificial floor of round stones.  It seems,\r\ntherefore, most probable that at a period when the land stood at a\r\nlower level there was a plain very similar to that now surrounding\r\nCallao, which being protected by a shingle beach, is raised but very\r\nlittle above the level of the sea.  On this plain, with its underlying\r\nred-clay beds, I imagine that the Indians manufactured their earthen\r\nvessels; and that, during some violent earthquake, the sea broke over\r\nthe beach, and converted the plain into a temporary lake, as happened\r\nround Callao in 1713 and 1746.  The water would then have deposited\r\nmud, containing fragments of pottery from the kilns, more abundant at\r\nsome spots than at others, and shells from the sea. This bed, with\r\nfossil earthenware, stands at about the same height with the shells on\r\nthe lower terrace of San Lorenzo, in which the cotton-thread and other\r\nrelics were embedded.\r\n\r\nHence we may safely conclude, that within the Indo-human period there\r\nhas been an elevation, as before alluded to, of more than eighty-five\r\nfeet; for some little elevation must have been lost by the coast having\r\nsubsided since the old maps were engraved.  At Valparaiso, although in\r\nthe 220 years before our visit, the elevation cannot have exceeded\r\nnineteen feet, yet subsequently to 1817, there has been a rise, partly\r\ninsensible and partly by a start during the shock of 1822, of ten or\r\neleven feet.  The antiquity of the Indo-human race here, judging by the\r\neighty-five feet rise of the land since the relics were embedded, is\r\nthe more remarkable, as on the coast of Patagonia, when the land stood\r\nabout the same number of feet lower, the Macrauchenia was a living\r\nbeast; but as the Patagonian coast is some way distant from the\r\nCordillera, the rising there may have been slower than here. At Bahia\r\nBlanca, the elevation has been only a few feet since the numerous\r\ngigantic quadrupeds were there entombed; and, according to the\r\ngenerally received opinion, when these extinct animals were living, man\r\ndid not exist. But the rising of that part of the coast of Patagonia,\r\nis perhaps no way connected with the Cordillera, but rather with a line\r\nof old volcanic rocks in Banda Oriental, so that it may have been\r\ninfinitely slower than on the shores of Peru. All these speculations,\r\nhowever, must be vague; for who will pretend to say that there may not\r\nhave been several periods of subsidence, intercalated between the\r\nmovements of elevation; for we know that along the whole coast of\r\nPatagonia, there have certainly been many and long pauses in the upward\r\naction of the elevatory forces.\r\n\r\n[1] Vol. iv. p. 11, and vol. ii. p. 217.

They are situated under the\r\nEquator, and between five and six hundred miles westward of the coast\r\nof America.  They are all formed of volcanic rocks; a few fragments of\r\ngranite curiously glazed and altered by the heat, can hardly be\r\nconsidered as an exception.  Some of the craters, surmounting the\r\nlarger islands, are of immense size, and they rise to a height of\r\nbetween three and four thousand feet.  Their flanks are studded by\r\ninnumerable smaller orifices.  I scarcely hesitate to affirm, that\r\nthere must be in the whole archipelago at least two thousand craters.\r\nThese consist either of lava or scoriae, or of finely-stratified,\r\nsandstone-like tuff.  Most of the latter are beautifully symmetrical;\r\nthey owe their origin to eruptions of volcanic mud without any lava: it\r\nis a remarkable circumstance that every one of the twenty-eight\r\ntuff-craters which were examined, had their southern sides either much\r\nlower than the other sides, or quite broken down and removed.  As all\r\nthese craters apparently have been formed when standing in the sea, and\r\nas the waves from the trade wind and the swell from the open Pacific\r\nhere unite their forces on the southern coasts of all the islands, this\r\nsingular uniformity in the broken state of the craters, composed of the\r\nsoft and yielding tuff, is easily explained.\r\n\r\nConsidering that these islands are placed directly under the equator,\r\nthe climate is far from being excessively hot; this seems chiefly\r\ncaused by the singularly low temperature of the surrounding water,\r\nbrought here by the great southern\r\n\r\n\r\n[map]\r\n\r\n\r\nPolar current.  Excepting during one short season, very little rain\r\nfalls, and even then it is irregular; but the clouds generally hang\r\nlow.  Hence, whilst the lower parts of the islands are very sterile,\r\nthe upper parts, at a height of a thousand feet and upwards, possess a\r\ndamp climate and a tolerably luxuriant vegetation.  This is especially\r\nthe case on the windward sides of the islands, which first receive and\r\ncondense the moisture from the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn the morning (17th) we landed on Chatham Island, which, like the\r\nothers, rises with a tame and rounded outline, broken here and there by\r\nscattered hillocks, the remains of former craters.  Nothing could be\r\nless inviting than the first appearance.  A broken field of black\r\nbasaltic lava, thrown into the most rugged waves, and crossed by great\r\nfissures, is everywhere covered by stunted, sun-burnt brushwood, which\r\nshows little signs of life.  The dry and parched surface, being heated\r\nby the noon-day sun, gave to the air a close and sultry feeling, like\r\nthat from a stove: we fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly.\r\nAlthough I diligently tried to collect as many plants as possible, I\r\nsucceeded in getting very few; and such wretched-looking little weeds\r\nwould have better become an arctic than an equatorial Flora.  The\r\nbrushwood appears, from a short distance, as leafless as our trees\r\nduring winter; and it was some time before I discovered that not only\r\nalmost every plant was now in full leaf, but that the greater number\r\nwere in flower. The commonest bush is one of the Euphorbiaceae: an\r\nacacia and a great odd-looking cactus are the only trees which afford\r\nany shade.  After the season of heavy rains, the islands are said to\r\nappear for a short time partially green.  The volcanic island of\r\nFernando Noronha, placed in many respects under nearly similar\r\nconditions, is the only other country where I have seen a vegetation at\r\nall like this of the Galapagos Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Beagle sailed round Chatham Island, and anchored in several bays.\r\nOne night I slept on shore on a part of the island, where black\r\ntruncated cones were extraordinarily numerous: from one small eminence\r\nI counted sixty of them, all surmounted by craters more or less\r\nperfect.  The greater number consisted merely of a ring of red scoriae\r\nor slags, cemented together: and their height above the plain of lava\r\nwas not more than from fifty to a hundred feet; none had been very\r\nlately active.  The entire surface of this part of the island seems to\r\nhave been permeated, like a sieve, by the subterranean vapours: here\r\nand there the lava, whilst soft, has been blown into great bubbles; and\r\nin other parts, the tops of caverns similarly formed have fallen in,\r\nleaving circular pits with steep sides.  From the regular form of the\r\nmany craters, they gave to the country an artificial appearance, which\r\nvividly reminded me of those parts of Staffordshire, where the great\r\niron-foundries are most numerous. The day was glowing hot, and the\r\nscrambling over the rough surface and through the intricate thickets,\r\nwas very fatiguing; but I was well repaid by the strange Cyclopean\r\nscene. As I was walking along I met two large tortoises, each of which\r\nmust have weighed at least two hundred pounds: one was eating a piece\r\nof cactus, and as I approached, it stared at me and slowly walked away;\r\nthe other gave a deep hiss, and drew in its head.  These huge reptiles,\r\nsurrounded by the black lava, the leafless shrubs, and large cacti,\r\nseemed to my fancy like some antediluvian animals.  The few\r\ndull-coloured birds cared no more for me than they did for the great\r\ntortoises.\r\n\r\n23rd.--The Beagle proceeded to Charles Island.  This archipelago has\r\nlong been frequented, first by the bucaniers, and latterly by whalers,\r\nbut it is only within the last six years, that a small colony has been\r\nestablished here.  The inhabitants are between two and three hundred in\r\nnumber; they are nearly all people of colour, who have been banished\r\nfor political crimes from the Republic of the Equator, of which Quito\r\nis the capital.  The settlement is placed about four and a half miles\r\ninland, and at a height probably of a thousand feet.  In the first part\r\nof the road we passed through leafless thickets, as in Chatham Island.\r\nHigher up, the woods gradually became greener; and as soon as we\r\ncrossed the ridge of the island, we were cooled by a fine southerly\r\nbreeze, and our sight refreshed by a green and thriving vegetation.  In\r\nthis upper region coarse grasses and ferns abound; but there are no\r\ntree-ferns: I saw nowhere any member of the palm family, which is the\r\nmore singular, as 360 miles northward, Cocos Island takes its name from\r\nthe number of cocoa-nuts.  The houses are irregularly scattered over a\r\nflat space of ground, which is cultivated with sweet potatoes and\r\nbananas.  It will not easily be imagined how pleasant the sight of\r\nblack mud was to us, after having been so long, accustomed to the\r\nparched soil of Peru and northern Chile.  The inhabitants, although\r\ncomplaining of poverty, obtain, without much trouble, the means of\r\nsubsistence. In the woods there are many wild pigs and goats; but the\r\nstaple article of animal food is supplied by the tortoises.  Their\r\nnumbers have of course been greatly reduced in this island, but the\r\npeople yet count on two days' hunting giving them food for the rest of\r\nthe week.  It is said that formerly single vessels have taken away as\r\nmany as seven hundred, and that the ship's company of a frigate some\r\nyears since brought down in one day two hundred tortoises to the beach.\r\n\r\nSeptember  29th.--We doubled the south-west extremity of Albemarle\r\nIsland, and the next day were nearly becalmed between it and Narborough\r\nIsland.  Both are covered with immense deluges of black naked lava,\r\nwhich have flowed either over the rims of the great caldrons, like\r\npitch over the rim of a pot in which it has been boiled, or have burst\r\nforth from smaller orifices on the flanks; in their descent they have\r\nspread over miles of the sea-coast.  On both of these islands,\r\neruptions are known to have taken place; and in Albemarle, we saw a\r\nsmall jet of smoke curling from the summit of one of the great craters.\r\nIn the evening we anchored in Bank's Cove, in Albemarle Island.  The\r\nnext morning I went out walking.  To the south of the broken\r\ntuff-crater, in which the Beagle was anchored, there was another\r\nbeautifully symmetrical one of an elliptic form; its longer axis was a\r\nlittle less than a mile, and its depth about 500 feet.  At its bottom\r\nthere was a shallow lake, in the middle of which a tiny crater formed\r\nan islet.  The day was overpoweringly hot, and the lake looked clear\r\nand blue: I hurried down the cindery slope, and, choked with dust,\r\neagerly tasted the water--but, to my sorrow, I found it salt as brine.\r\n\r\nThe rocks on the coast abounded with great black lizards, between three\r\nand four feet long; and on the hills, an ugly yellowish-brown species\r\nwas equally common.  We saw many of this latter kind, some clumsily\r\nrunning out of the way, and others shuffling into their burrows.  I\r\nshall presently describe in more detail the habits of both these\r\nreptiles.  The whole of this northern part of Albemarle Island is\r\nmiserably sterile.\r\n\r\nOctober 8th.--We arrived at James Island: this island, as well as\r\nCharles Island, were long since thus named after our kings of the\r\nStuart line.  Mr. Bynoe, myself, and our servants were left here for a\r\nweek, with provisions and a tent, whilst the Beagle went for water.  We\r\nfound here a party of Spaniards, who had been sent from Charles Island\r\nto dry fish, and to salt tortoise-meat.  About six miles inland, and at\r\nthe height of nearly 2000 feet, a hovel had been built in which two men\r\nlived, who were employed in catching tortoises, whilst the others were\r\nfishing on the coast.  I paid this party two visits, and slept there\r\none night.  As in the other islands, the lower region was covered by\r\nnearly leafless bushes, but the trees were here of a larger growth than\r\nelsewhere, several being two feet and some even two feet nine inches in\r\ndiameter.  The upper region being kept damp by the clouds, supports a\r\ngreen and flourishing vegetation.  So damp was the ground, that there\r\nwere large beds of a coarse cyperus, in which great numbers of a very\r\nsmall water-rail lived and bred.  While staying in this upper region,\r\nwe lived entirely upon tortoise-meat: the breast-plate roasted (as the\r\nGauchos do _carne con cuero_), with the flesh on it, is very good; and\r\nthe young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my\r\ntaste is indifferent.\r\n\r\nOne day we accompanied a party of the Spaniards in their whale-boat to\r\na salina, or lake from which salt is procured.  After landing, we had a\r\nvery rough walk over a rugged field of recent lava, which has almost\r\nsurrounded a tuff-crater, at the bottom of which the salt-lake lies.\r\nThe water is only three or four inches deep, and rests on a layer of\r\nbeautifully crystallized, white salt.  The lake is quite circular, and\r\nis fringed with a border of bright green succulent plants; the almost\r\nprecipitous walls of the crater are clothed with wood, so that the\r\nscene was altogether both picturesque and curious.  A few years since,\r\nthe sailors belonging to a sealing-vessel murdered their captain in\r\nthis quiet spot; and we saw his skull lying among the bushes.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of our stay of a week, the sky was cloudless,\r\nand if the trade-wind failed for an hour, the heat became very\r\noppressive.  On two days, the thermometer within the tent stood for\r\nsome hours at 93 degs.; but in the open air, in the wind and sun, at\r\nonly 85 degs.  The sand was extremely hot; the thermometer placed in\r\nsome of a brown colour immediately rose to 137 degs., and how much\r\nabove that it would have risen, I do not know, for it was not graduated\r\nany higher.  The black sand felt much hotter, so that even in thick\r\nboots it was quite disagreeable to walk over it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and well\r\ndeserves attention.  Most of the organic productions are aboriginal\r\ncreations, found nowhere else; there is even a difference between the\r\ninhabitants of the different islands; yet all show a marked\r\nrelationship with those of America, though separated from that\r\ncontinent by an open space of ocean, between 500 and 600 miles in\r\nwidth.  The archipelago is a little world within itself, or rather a\r\nsatellite attached to America, whence it has derived a few stray\r\ncolonists, and has received the general character of its indigenous\r\nproductions.  Considering the small size of the islands, we feel the\r\nmore astonished at the number of their aboriginal beings, and at their\r\nconfined range.  Seeing every height crowned with its crater, and the\r\nboundaries of most of the lava-streams still distinct, we are led to\r\nbelieve that within a period geologically recent the unbroken ocean was\r\nhere spread out.  Hence, both in space and time, we seem to be brought\r\nsomewhat near to that great fact--that mystery of mysteries--the first\r\nappearance of new beings on this earth.\r\n\r\nOf terrestrial mammals, there is only one which must be considered as\r\nindigenous, namely, a mouse (Mus Galapagoensis), and this is confined,\r\nas far as I could ascertain, to Chatham Island, the most easterly\r\nisland of the group.  It belongs, as I am informed by Mr. Waterhouse,\r\nto a division of the family of mice characteristic of America.  At\r\nJames Island, there is a rat sufficiently distinct from the common kind\r\nto have been named and described by Mr. Waterhouse; but as it belongs\r\nto the old-world division of the family, and as this island has been\r\nfrequented by ships for the last hundred and fifty years, I can hardly\r\ndoubt that this rat is merely a variety produced by the new and\r\npeculiar climate, food, and soil, to which it has been subjected.\r\nAlthough no one has a right to speculate without distinct facts, yet\r\neven with respect to the Chatham Island mouse, it should be borne in\r\nmind, that it may possibly be an American species imported here; for I\r\nhave seen, in a most unfrequented part of the Pampas, a native mouse\r\nliving in the roof of a newly built hovel, and therefore its\r\ntransportation in a vessel is not improbable: analogous facts have been\r\nobserved by Dr. Richardson in North America.\r\n\r\nOf land-birds I obtained twenty-six kinds, all peculiar to the group\r\nand found nowhere else, with the exception of one lark-like finch from\r\nNorth America (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), which ranges on that continent\r\nas far north as 54 degs., and generally frequents marshes.  The other\r\ntwenty-five birds consist, firstly, of a hawk, curiously intermediate\r\nin structure between a buzzard and the American group of\r\ncarrion-feeding Polybori; and with these latter birds it agrees most\r\nclosely in every habit and even tone of voice.  Secondly, there are two\r\nowls, representing the short-eared and white barn-owls of Europe.\r\nThirdly, a wren, three tyrant-flycatchers (two of them species of\r\nPyrocephalus, one or both of which would be ranked by some\r\nornithologists as only varieties), and a dove--all analogous to, but\r\ndistinct from, American species.  Fourthly, a swallow, which though\r\ndiffering from the Progne purpurea of both Americas, only in being\r\nrather duller colored, smaller, and slenderer, is considered by Mr.\r\nGould as specifically distinct.  Fifthly, there are three species of\r\nmocking thrush--a form highly characteristic of America.  The remaining\r\nland-birds form a most singular group of finches, related to each other\r\nin the structure of their beaks, short tails, form of body and plumage:\r\nthere are thirteen species, which Mr. Gould has divided into four\r\nsub-groups.  All these species are peculiar to this archipelago; and so\r\nis the whole group, with the exception of one species of the sub-group\r\nCactornis, lately brought from Bow Island, in the Low Archipelago.  Of\r\nCactornis, the two species may be often seen climbing about the flowers\r\nof the great cactus-trees; but all the other species of this group of\r\nfinches, mingled together in flocks, feed on the dry and sterile ground\r\nof the lower districts.  The males of all, or certainly of the greater\r\nnumber, are jet black; and the females (with perhaps one or two\r\nexceptions) are brown.  The most curious fact is the perfect gradation\r\nin the size of the beaks in the different species of Geospiza, from one\r\nas large as that of a hawfinch to that of a chaffinch, and (if Mr.\r\nGould is right in including his sub-group, Certhidea, in the main\r\ngroup) even to that of a warbler.  The largest beak in the genus\r\nGeospiza is shown in Fig. 1, and the smallest in Fig. 3; but instead of\r\nthere being only one intermediate species, with a beak of the size\r\nshown in Fig. 2, there are no less than six species with insensibly\r\ngraduated beaks.  The beak of the sub-group Certhidea, is shown in Fig.\r\n4.  The beak of Cactornis is\r\n\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\n1. Geospiza magnirostris.      2. Geospiza fortis. 3. Geospiza parvula.\r\n4. Certhidea olivasea.\r\n\r\n\r\nsomewhat like that of a starling, and that of the fourth sub-group,\r\nCamarhynchus, is slightly parrot-shaped.  Seeing this gradation and\r\ndiversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds,\r\none might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this\r\narchipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different\r\nends.  In a like manner it might be fancied that a bird originally a\r\nbuzzard, had been induced here to undertake the office of the\r\ncarrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent.\r\n\r\nOf waders and water-birds I was able to get only eleven kinds, and of\r\nthese only three (including a rail confined to the damp summits of the\r\nislands) are new species.  Considering the wandering habits of the\r\ngulls, I was surprised to find that the species inhabiting these\r\nislands is peculiar, but allied to one from the southern parts of South\r\nAmerica. The far greater peculiarity of the land-birds, namely,\r\ntwenty-five out of twenty-six, being new species, or at least new\r\nraces, compared with the waders and web-footed birds, is in accordance\r\nwith the greater range which these latter orders have in all parts of\r\nthe world.  We shall hereafter see this law of aquatic forms, whether\r\nmarine or fresh-water, being less peculiar at any given point of the\r\nearth's surface than the terrestrial forms of the same classes,\r\nstrikingly illustrated in the shells, and in a lesser degree in the\r\ninsects of this archipelago.\r\n\r\nTwo of the waders are rather smaller than the same species brought from\r\nother places: the swallow is also smaller, though it is doubtful\r\nwhether or not it is distinct from its analogue.  The two owls, the two\r\ntyrant-catchers (Pyrocephalus) and the dove, are also smaller than the\r\nanalogous but distinct species, to which they are most nearly related;\r\non the other hand, the gull is rather larger.  The two owls, the\r\nswallow, all three species of mocking-thrush, the dove in its separate\r\ncolours though not in its whole plumage, the Totanus, and the gull, are\r\nlikewise duskier coloured than their analogous species; and in the case\r\nof the mocking-thrush and Totanus, than any other species of the two\r\ngenera. With the exception of a wren with a fine yellow breast, and of\r\na tyrant-flycatcher with a scarlet tuft and breast, none of the birds\r\nare brilliantly coloured, as might have been expected in an equatorial\r\ndistrict.  Hence it would appear probable, that the same causes which\r\nhere make the immigrants of some peculiar species smaller, make most of\r\nthe peculiar Galapageian species also smaller, as well as very\r\ngenerally more dusky coloured.  All the plants have a wretched, weedy\r\nappearance, and I did not see one beautiful flower.  The insects,\r\nagain, are small-sized and dull-coloured, and, as Mr. Waterhouse\r\ninforms me, there is nothing in their general appearance which would\r\nhave led him to imagine that they had come from under the equator. [1]\r\nThe birds, plants, and insects have a desert character, and are not\r\nmore brilliantly coloured than those from southern Patagonia; we may,\r\ntherefore, conclude that the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical\r\nproductions, is not related either to the heat or light of those zones,\r\nbut to some other cause, perhaps to the conditions of existence being\r\ngenerally favourable to life.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the order of reptiles, which gives the most\r\nstriking character to the zoology of these islands. The species are not\r\nnumerous, but the numbers of individuals of each species are\r\nextraordinarily great.  There is one small lizard belonging to a South\r\nAmerican genus, and two species (and probably more) of the\r\nAmblyrhynchus--a genus confined to the Galapagos Islands.  There is one\r\nsnake which is numerous; it is identical, as I am informed by M.\r\nBibron, with the Psammophis Temminckii from Chile. [2] Of sea-turtle I\r\nbelieve there are more than one species, and of tortoises there are, as\r\nwe shall presently show, two or three species or races.  Of toads and\r\nfrogs there are none: I was surprised at this, considering how well\r\nsuited for them the temperate and damp upper woods appeared to be.  It\r\nrecalled to my mind the remark made by Bory St. Vincent, [3] namely,\r\nthat none of this family are found on any of the volcanic islands in\r\nthe great oceans.  As far as I can ascertain from various works, this\r\nseems to hold good throughout the Pacific, and even in the large\r\nislands of the Sandwich archipelago.  Mauritius offers an apparent\r\nexception, where I saw the Rana Mascariensis in abundance: this frog is\r\nsaid now to inhabit the Seychelles, Madagascar, and Bourbon; but on the\r\nother hand, Du Bois, in his voyage in 1669, states that there were no\r\nreptiles in Bourbon except tortoises; and the Officier du Roi asserts\r\nthat before 1768 it had been attempted, without success, to introduce\r\nfrogs into Mauritius--I presume for the purpose of eating: hence it may\r\nbe well doubted whether this frog is an aboriginal of these islands.\r\nThe absence of the frog family in the oceanic islands is the more\r\nremarkable, when contrasted with the case of lizards, which swarm on\r\nmost of the smallest islands.  May this difference not be caused, by\r\nthe greater facility with which the eggs of lizards, protected by\r\ncalcareous shells might be transported through salt-water, than could\r\nthe slimy spawn of frogs?\r\n\r\nI will first describe the habits of the tortoise (Testudo nigra,\r\nformerly called Indica), which has been so frequently alluded to. These\r\nanimals are found, I believe, on all the islands of the archipelago;\r\ncertainly on the greater number. They frequent in preference the high\r\ndamp parts, but they likewise live in the lower and arid districts.  I\r\nhave already shown, from the numbers which have been caught in a single\r\nday, how very numerous they must be.  Some grow to an immense size: Mr.\r\nLawson, an Englishman, and vice-governor of the colony, told us that he\r\nhad seen several so large, that it required six or eight men to lift\r\nthem from the ground; and that some had afforded as much as two hundred\r\npounds of meat.  The old males are the largest, the females rarely\r\ngrowing to so great a size: the male can readily be distinguished from\r\nthe female by the greater length of its tail.  The tortoises which live\r\non those islands where there is no water, or in the lower and arid\r\nparts of the others, feed chiefly on the succulent cactus.  Those which\r\nfrequent the higher and damp regions, eat the leaves of various trees,\r\na kind of berry (called guayavita) which is acid and austere, and\r\nlikewise a pale green filamentous lichen (Usnera plicata), that hangs\r\nfrom the boughs of the trees.\r\n\r\nThe tortoise is very fond of water, drinking large quantities, and\r\nwallowing in the mud.  The larger islands alone possess springs, and\r\nthese are always situated towards the central parts, and at a\r\nconsiderable height.  The tortoises, therefore, which frequent the\r\nlower districts, when thirsty, are obliged to travel from a long\r\ndistance.  Hence broad and well-beaten paths branch off in every\r\ndirection from the wells down to the sea-coast; and the Spaniards by\r\nfollowing them up, first discovered the watering-places.  When I landed\r\nat Chatham Island, I could not imagine what animal travelled so\r\nmethodically along well-chosen tracks.  Near the springs it was a\r\ncurious spectacle to behold many of these huge creatures, one set\r\neagerly travelling onwards with outstretched necks, and another set\r\nreturning, after having drunk their fill.  When the tortoise arrives at\r\nthe spring, quite regardless of any spectator, he buries his head in\r\nthe water above his eyes, and greedily swallows great mouthfuls, at the\r\nrate of about ten in a minute.  The inhabitants say each animal stays\r\nthree or four days in the neighbourhood of the water, and then returns\r\nto the lower country; but they differed respecting the frequency of\r\nthese visits.  The animal probably regulates them according to the\r\nnature of the food on which it has lived.  It is, however, certain,\r\nthat tortoises can subsist even on these islands where there is no\r\nother water than what falls during a few rainy days in the year.\r\n\r\nI believe it is well ascertained, that the bladder of the frog acts as\r\na reservoir for the moisture necessary to its existence: such seems to\r\nbe the case with the tortoise.  For some time after a visit to the\r\nsprings, their urinary bladders are distended with fluid, which is said\r\ngradually to decrease in volume, and to become less pure.  The\r\ninhabitants, when walking in the lower district, and overcome with\r\nthirst, often take advantage of this circumstance, and drink the\r\ncontents of the bladder if full: in one I saw killed, the fluid was\r\nquite limpid, and had only a very slightly bitter taste.  The\r\ninhabitants, however, always first drink the water in the pericardium,\r\nwhich is described as being best.\r\n\r\nThe tortoises, when purposely moving towards any point, travel by night\r\nand day, and arrive at their journey's end much sooner than would be\r\nexpected.  The inhabitants, from observing marked individuals, consider\r\nthat they travel a distance of about eight miles in two or three days.\r\nOne large tortoise, which I watched, walked at the rate of sixty yards\r\nin ten minutes, that is 360 yards in the hour, or four miles a\r\nday,--allowing a little time for it to eat on the road.  During the\r\nbreeding season, when the male and female are together, the male utters\r\na hoarse roar or bellowing, which, it is said, can be heard at the\r\ndistance of more than a hundred yards. The female never uses her voice,\r\nand the male only at these times; so that when the people hear this\r\nnoise, they know that the two are together.  They were at this time\r\n(October) laying their eggs.  The female, where the soil is sandy,\r\ndeposits them together, and covers them up with sand; but where the\r\nground is rocky she drops them indiscriminately in any hole: Mr. Bynoe\r\nfound seven placed in a fissure.  The egg is white and spherical; one\r\nwhich I measured was seven inches and three-eighths in circumference,\r\nand therefore larger than a hen's egg.  The young tortoises, as soon as\r\nthey are hatched, fall a prey in great numbers to the carrion-feeding\r\nbuzzard.  The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from\r\nfalling down precipices: at least, several of the inhabitants told me,\r\nthat they never found one dead without some evident cause.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf;\r\ncertainly they do not overhear a person walking close behind them.  I\r\nwas always amused when overtaking one of these great monsters, as it\r\nwas quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it\r\nwould draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the\r\nground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead.  I frequently got on\r\ntheir backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their\r\nshells, they would rise up and walk away;--but I found it very\r\ndifficult to keep my balance.  The flesh of this animal is largely\r\nemployed, both fresh and salted; and a beautifully clear oil is\r\nprepared from the fat.  When a tortoise is caught, the man makes a slit\r\nin the skin near its tail, so as to see inside its body, whether the\r\nfat under the dorsal plate is thick.  If it is not, the animal is\r\nliberated and it is said to recover soon from this strange operation.\r\nIn order to secure the tortoise, it is not sufficient to turn them like\r\nturtle, for they are often able to get on their legs again.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that this tortoise is an aboriginal\r\ninhabitant of the Galapagos; for it is found on all, or nearly all, the\r\nislands, even on some of the smaller ones where there is no water; had\r\nit been an imported species, this would hardly have been the case in a\r\ngroup which has been so little frequented.  Moreover, the old Bucaniers\r\nfound this tortoise in greater numbers even than at present: Wood and\r\nRogers also, in 1708, say that it is the opinion of the Spaniards, that\r\nit is found nowhere else in this quarter of the world.  It is now\r\nwidely distributed; but it may be questioned whether it is in any other\r\nplace an aboriginal.  The bones of a tortoise at Mauritius, associated\r\nwith those of the extinct Dodo, have generally been considered as\r\nbelonging to this tortoise; if this had been so, undoubtedly it must\r\nhave been there indigenous; but M. Bibron informs me that he believes\r\nthat it was distinct, as the species now living there certainly is.\r\n\r\nThe Amblyrhynchus, a remarkable genus of lizards, is confined to this\r\narchipelago; there are two species, resembling\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\neach other in general form, one being terrestrial and the other\r\naquatic.  This latter species (A. cristatus) was first characterized by\r\nMr. Bell, who well foresaw, from its short, broad head, and strong\r\nclaws of equal length, that its habits of life would turn out very\r\npeculiar, and different from those of its nearest ally, the Iguana.  It\r\nis extremely common on all the islands throughout the group, and lives\r\nexclusively on the rocky sea-beaches, being never found, at least I\r\nnever saw one, even ten yards in-shore.  It is a hideous-looking\r\ncreature, of a dirty black colour, stupid, and sluggish in its\r\nmovements. The usual length of a full-grown one is about a yard, but\r\nthere are some even four feet long; a large one weighed twenty pounds:\r\non the island of Albemarle they seem to grow to a greater size than\r\nelsewhere.  Their tails are flattened sideways, and all four feet\r\npartially webbed.  They are occasionally seen some hundred yards from\r\nthe shore, swimming about; and Captain Collnett, in his Voyage says,\r\n\"They go to sea in herds a-fishing, and sun themselves on the rocks;\r\nand may be called alligators in miniature.\" It must not, however, be\r\nsupposed that they live on fish.  When in the water this lizard swims\r\nwith perfect ease and quickness, by a serpentine movement of its body\r\nand flattened tail--the legs being motionless and closely collapsed on\r\nits sides. A seaman on board sank one, with a heavy weight attached to\r\nit, thinking thus to kill it directly; but when, an hour afterwards, he\r\ndrew up the line, it was quite active.  Their limbs and strong claws\r\nare admirably adapted for crawling over the rugged and fissured masses\r\nof lava, which everywhere form the coast.  In such situations, a group\r\nof six or seven of these hideous reptiles may oftentimes be seen on the\r\nblack rocks, a few feet above the surf, basking in the sun with\r\noutstretched legs.\r\n\r\nI opened the stomachs of several, and found them largely distended with\r\nminced sea-weed (Ulvae), which grows in thin foliaceous expansions of a\r\nbright green or a dull red colour.  I do not recollect having observed\r\nthis sea-weed in any quantity on the tidal rocks; and I have reason to\r\nbelieve it grows at the bottom of the sea, at some little distance from\r\nthe coast.  If such be the case, the object of these animals\r\noccasionally going out to sea is explained.  The stomach contained\r\nnothing but the sea-weed.  Mr. Baynoe, however, found a piece of crab\r\nin one; but this might have got in accidentally, in the same manner as\r\nI have seen a caterpillar, in the midst of some lichen, in the paunch\r\nof a tortoise.  The intestines were large, as in other herbivorous\r\nanimals.  The nature of this lizard's food, as well as the structure of\r\nits tail and feet, and the fact of its having been seen voluntarily\r\nswimming out at sea, absolutely prove its aquatic habits; yet there is\r\nin this respect one strange anomaly, namely, that when frightened it\r\nwill not enter the water.  Hence it is easy to drive these lizards down\r\nto any little point overhanging the sea, where they will sooner allow a\r\nperson to catch hold of their tails than jump into the water.  They do\r\nnot seem to have any notion of biting; but when much frightened they\r\nsquirt a drop of fluid from each nostril.  I threw one several times as\r\nfar as I could, into a deep pool left by the retiring tide; but it\r\ninvariably returned in a direct line to the spot where I stood.  It\r\nswam near the bottom, with a very graceful and rapid movement, and\r\noccasionally aided itself over the uneven ground with its feet.  As\r\nsoon as it arrived near the edge, but still being under water, it tried\r\nto conceal itself in the tufts of sea-weed, or it entered some crevice.\r\nAs soon as it thought the danger was past, it crawled out on the dry\r\nrocks, and shuffled away as quickly as it could.  I several times\r\ncaught this same lizard, by driving it down to a point, and though\r\npossessed of such perfect powers of diving and swimming, nothing would\r\ninduce it to enter the water; and as often as I threw it in, it\r\nreturned in the manner above described.  Perhaps this singular piece of\r\napparent stupidity may be accounted for by the circumstance, that this\r\nreptile has no enemy whatever on shore, whereas at sea it must often\r\nfall a prey to the numerous sharks.  Hence, probably, urged by a fixed\r\nand hereditary instinct that the shore is its place of safety, whatever\r\nthe emergency may be, it there takes refuge.\r\n\r\nDuring our visit (in October), I saw extremely few small individuals of\r\nthis species, and none I should think under a year old.  From this\r\ncircumstance it seems probable that the breeding season had not then\r\ncommenced.  I asked several of the inhabitants if they knew where it\r\nlaid its eggs: they said that they knew nothing of its propagation,\r\nalthough well acquainted with the eggs of the land kind--a fact,\r\nconsidering how very common this lizard is, not a little extraordinary.\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the terrestrial species (A. Demarlii), with a round\r\ntail, and toes without webs.  This lizard, instead of being found like\r\nthe other on all the islands, is confined to the central part of the\r\narchipelago, namely to Albemarle, James, Barrington, and Indefatigable\r\nislands.  To the southward, in Charles, Hood, and Chatham islands, and\r\nto the northward, in Towers, Bindloes, and Abingdon, I neither saw nor\r\nheard of any.  It would appear as if it had been created in the centre\r\nof the archipelago, and thence had been dispersed only to a certain\r\ndistance.  Some of these lizards inhabit the high and damp parts of the\r\nislands, but they are much more numerous in the lower and sterile\r\ndistricts near the coast.  I cannot give a more forcible proof of their\r\nnumbers, than by stating that when we were left at James Island, we\r\ncould not for some time find a spot free from their burrows on which to\r\npitch our single tent.  Like their brothers the sea-kind, they are ugly\r\nanimals, of a yellowish orange beneath, and of a brownish red colour\r\nabove: from their low facial angle they have a singularly stupid\r\nappearance.  They are, perhaps, of a rather less size than the marine\r\nspecies; but several of them weighed between ten and fifteen pounds. In\r\ntheir movements they are lazy and half torpid.  When not frightened,\r\nthey slowly crawl along with their tails and bellies dragging on the\r\nground.  They often stop, and doze for a minute or two, with closed\r\neyes and hind legs spread out on the parched soil.\r\n\r\nThey inhabit burrows, which they sometimes make between fragments of\r\nlava, but more generally on level patches of the soft sandstone-like\r\ntuff.  The holes do not appear to be very deep, and they enter the\r\nground at a small angle; so that when walking over these\r\nlizard-warrens, the soil is constantly giving way, much to the\r\nannoyance of the tired walker.  This animal, when making its burrow,\r\nworks alternately the opposite sides of its body.  One front leg for a\r\nshort time scratches up the soil, and throws it towards the hind foot,\r\nwhich is well placed so as to heave it beyond the mouth of the hole.\r\nThat side of the body being tired, the other takes up the task, and so\r\non alternately.  I watched one for a long time, till half its body was\r\nburied; I then walked up and pulled it by the tail, at this it was\r\ngreatly astonished, and soon shuffled up to see what was the matter;\r\nand then stared me in the face, as much as to say, \"What made you pull\r\nmy tail?\"\r\n\r\nThey feed by day, and do not wander far from their burrows; if\r\nfrightened, they rush to them with a most awkward gait.  Except when\r\nrunning down hill, they cannot move very fast, apparently from the\r\nlateral position of their legs. They are not at all timorous: when\r\nattentively watching any one, they curl their tails, and, raising\r\nthemselves on their front legs, nod their heads vertically, with a\r\nquick movement, and try to look very fierce; but in reality they are\r\nnot at all so: if one just stamps on the ground, down go their tails,\r\nand off they shuffle as quickly as they can.  I have frequently\r\nobserved small fly-eating lizards, when watching anything, nod their\r\nheads in precisely the same manner; but I do not at all know for what\r\npurpose.  If this Amblyrhynchus is held and plagued with a stick, it\r\nwill bite it very severely; but I caught many by the tail, and they\r\nnever tried to bite me. If two are placed on the ground and held\r\ntogether, they will fight, and bite each other till blood is drawn.\r\n\r\nThe individuals, and they are the greater number, which inhabit the\r\nlower country, can scarcely taste a drop of water throughout the year;\r\nbut they consume much of the succulent cactus, the branches of which\r\nare occasionally broken off by the wind.  I several times threw a piece\r\nto two or three of them when together; and it was amusing enough to see\r\nthem trying to seize and carry it away in their mouths, like so many\r\nhungry dogs with a bone.  They eat very deliberately, but do not chew\r\ntheir food.  The little birds are aware how harmless these creatures\r\nare: I have seen one of the thick-billed finches picking at one end of\r\na piece of cactus (which is much relished by all the animals of the\r\nlower region), whilst a lizard was eating at the other end; and\r\nafterwards the little bird with the utmost indifference hopped on the\r\nback of the reptile.\r\n\r\nI opened the stomachs of several, and found them full of vegetable\r\nfibres and leaves of different trees, especially of an acacia.  In the\r\nupper region they live chiefly on the acid and astringent berries of\r\nthe guayavita, under which trees I have seen these lizards and the huge\r\ntortoises feeding together.  To obtain the acacia-leaves they crawl up\r\nthe low stunted trees; and it is not uncommon to see a pair quietly\r\nbrowsing, whilst seated on a branch several feet above the ground.\r\nThese lizards, when cooked, yield a white meat, which is liked by those\r\nwhose stomachs soar above all prejudices.\r\n\r\nHumboldt has remarked that in intertropical South America, all lizards\r\nwhich inhabit dry regions are esteemed delicacies for the table.  The\r\ninhabitants state that those which inhabit the upper damp parts drink\r\nwater, but that the others do not, like the tortoises, travel up for it\r\nfrom the lower sterile country.  At the time of our visit, the females\r\nhad within their bodies numerous, large, elongated eggs, which they lay\r\nin their burrows: the inhabitants seek them for food.\r\n\r\nThese two species of Amblyrhynchus agree, as I have already stated, in\r\ntheir general structure, and in many of their habits.  Neither have\r\nthat rapid movement, so characteristic of the genera Lacerta and\r\nIguana.  They are both herbivorous, although the kind of vegetation on\r\nwhich they feed is so very different.  Mr. Bell has given the name to\r\nthe genus from the shortness of the snout: indeed, the form of the\r\nmouth may almost be compared to that of the tortoise: one is led to\r\nsuppose that this is an adaptation to their herbivorous appetites.  It\r\nis very interesting thus to find a well-characterized genus, having its\r\nmarine and terrestrial species, belonging to so confined a portion of\r\nthe world.  The aquatic species is by far the most remarkable, because\r\nit is the only existing lizard which lives on marine vegetable\r\nproductions.  As I at first observed, these islands are not so\r\nremarkable for the number of the species of reptiles, as for that of\r\nthe individuals, when we remember the well-beaten paths made by the\r\nthousands of huge tortoises--the many turtles--the great warrens of the\r\nterrestrial Amblyrhynchus--and the groups of the marine species basking\r\non the coast-rocks of every island--we must admit that there is no\r\nother quarter of the world where this Order replaces the herbivorous\r\nmammalia in so extraordinary a manner.  The geologist on hearing this\r\nwill probably refer back in his mind to the Secondary epochs, when\r\nlizards, some herbivorous, some carnivorous, and of dimensions\r\ncomparable only with our existing whales, swarmed on the land and in\r\nthe sea.  It is, therefore, worthy of his observation, that this\r\narchipelago, instead of possessing a humid climate and rank vegetation,\r\ncannot be considered otherwise than extremely arid, and, for an\r\nequatorial region, remarkably temperate.\r\n\r\nTo finish with the zoology: the fifteen kinds of sea-fish which I\r\nprocured here are all new species; they belong to twelve genera, all\r\nwidely distributed, with the exception of Prionotus, of which the four\r\npreviously known species live on the eastern side of America.  Of\r\nland-shells I collected sixteen kinds (and two marked varieties), of\r\nwhich, with the exception of one Helix found at Tahiti, all are\r\npeculiar to this archipelago: a single fresh-water shell (Paludina) is\r\ncommon to Tahiti and Van Diemen's Land.  Mr. Cuming, before our voyage\r\nprocured here ninety species of sea-shells, and this does not include\r\nseveral species not yet specifically examined, of Trochus, Turbo,\r\nMonodonta, and Nassa.  He has been kind enough to give me the following\r\ninteresting results: Of the ninety shells, no less than forty-seven are\r\nunknown elsewhere--a wonderful fact, considering how widely distributed\r\nsea-shells generally are.  Of the forty-three shells found in other\r\nparts of the world, twenty-five inhabit the western coast of America,\r\nand of these eight are distinguishable as varieties; the remaining\r\neighteen (including one variety) were found by Mr. Cuming in the Low\r\nArchipelago, and some of them also at the Philippines.  This fact of\r\nshells from islands in the central parts of the Pacific occurring here,\r\ndeserves notice, for not one single sea-shell is known to be common to\r\nthe islands of that ocean and to the west coast of America.  The space\r\nof open sea running north and south off the west coast, separates two\r\nquite distinct conchological provinces; but at the Galapagos\r\nArchipelago we have a halting-place, where many new forms have been\r\ncreated, and whither these two great conchological provinces have each\r\nsent up several colonists.  The American province has also sent here\r\nrepresentative species; for there is a Galapageian species of\r\nMonoceros, a genus only found on the west coast of America; and there\r\nare Galapageian species of Fissurella and Cancellaria, genera common on\r\nthe west coast, but not found (as I am informed by Mr. Cuming) in the\r\ncentral islands of the Pacific.  On the other hand, there are\r\nGalapageian species of Oniscia and Stylifer, genera common to the West\r\nIndies and to the Chinese and Indian seas, but not found either on the\r\nwest coast of America or in the central Pacific.  I may here add, that\r\nafter the comparison by Messrs. Cuming and Hinds of about 2000 shells\r\nfrom the eastern and western coasts of America, only one single shell\r\nwas found in common, namely, the Purpura patula, which inhabits the\r\nWest Indies, the coast of Panama, and the Galapagos.  We have,\r\ntherefore, in this quarter of the world, three great conchological\r\nsea-provinces, quite distinct, though surprisingly near each other,\r\nbeing separated by long north and south spaces either of land or of\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nI took great pains in collecting the insects, but excepting Tierra del\r\nFuego, I never saw in this respect so poor a country. Even in the upper\r\nand damp region I procured very few, excepting some minute Diptera and\r\nHymenoptera, mostly of common mundane forms.  As before remarked, the\r\ninsects, for a tropical region, are of very small size and dull\r\ncolours. Of beetles I collected twenty-five species (excluding a\r\nDermestes and Corynetes imported, wherever a ship touches); of these,\r\ntwo belong to the Harpalidae, two to the Hydrophilidae, nine to three\r\nfamilies of the Heteromera, and the remaining twelve to as many\r\ndifferent families.  This circumstance of insects (and I may add\r\nplants), where few in number, belonging to many different families, is,\r\nI believe, very general.  Mr. Waterhouse, who has published [4] an\r\naccount of the insects of this archipelago, and to whom I am indebted\r\nfor the above details, informs me that there are several new genera:\r\nand that of the genera not new, one or two are American, and the rest\r\nof mundane distribution. With the exception of a wood-feeding Apate,\r\nand of one or probably two water-beetles from the American continent,\r\nall the species appear to be new.\r\n\r\nThe botany of this group is fully as interesting as the zoology.  Dr.\r\nJ. Hooker will soon publish in the \"Linnean Transactions\" a full\r\naccount of the Flora, and I am much indebted to him for the following\r\ndetails.  Of flowering plants there are, as far as at present is known,\r\n185 species, and 40 cryptogamic species, making altogether 225; of this\r\nnumber I was fortunate enough to bring home 193.  Of the flowering\r\nplants, 100 are new species, and are probably confined to this\r\narchipelago.  Dr. Hooker conceives that, of the plants not so confined,\r\nat least 10 species found near the cultivated ground at Charles Island,\r\nhave been imported. It is, I think, surprising that more American\r\nspecies have not been introduced naturally, considering that the\r\ndistance is only between 500 and 600 miles from the continent, and that\r\n(according to Collnet, p. 58) drift-wood, bamboos, canes, and the nuts\r\nof a palm, are often washed on the south-eastern shores.  The\r\nproportion of 100 flowering plants out of 183 (or 175 excluding the\r\nimported weeds) being new, is sufficient, I conceive, to make the\r\nGalapagos Archipelago a distinct botanical province; but this Flora is\r\nnot nearly so peculiar as that of St. Helena, nor, as I am informed by\r\nDr. Hooker, of Juan Fernandez.  The peculiarity of the Galapageian\r\nFlora is best shown in certain families;--thus there are 21 species of\r\nCompositae, of which 20 are peculiar to this archipelago; these belong\r\nto twelve genera, and of these genera no less than ten are confined to\r\nthe archipelago! Dr. Hooker informs me that the Flora has an\r\nundoubtedly Western American character; nor can he detect in it any\r\naffinity with that of the Pacific.  If, therefore, we except the\r\neighteen marine, the one fresh-water, and one land-shell, which have\r\napparently come here as colonists from the central islands of the\r\nPacific, and likewise the one distinct Pacific species of the\r\nGalapageian group of finches, we see that this archipelago, though\r\nstanding in the Pacific Ocean, is zoologically part of America.\r\n\r\nIf this character were owing merely to immigrants from America, there\r\nwould be little remarkable in it; but we see that a vast majority of\r\nall the land animals, and that more than half of the flowering plants,\r\nare aboriginal productions. It was most striking to be surrounded by new\r\nbirds, new reptiles, new shells, new insects, new plants, and yet by\r\ninnumerable trifling details of structure, and even by the tones of\r\nvoice and plumage of the birds, to have the temperate plains of\r\nPatagonia, or rather the hot dry deserts of Northern Chile, vividly\r\nbrought before my eyes.  Why, on these small points of land, which\r\nwithin a late geological period must have been covered by the ocean,\r\nwhich are formed by basaltic lava, and therefore differ in geological\r\ncharacter from the American continent, and which are placed under a\r\npeculiar climate,--why were their aboriginal inhabitants, associated, I\r\nmay add, in different proportions both in kind and number from those on\r\nthe continent, and therefore acting on each other in a different\r\nmanner--why were they created on American types of organization?  It is\r\nprobable that the islands of the Cape de Verd group resemble, in all\r\ntheir physical conditions, far more closely the Galapagos Islands, than\r\nthese latter physically resemble the coast of America, yet the\r\naboriginal inhabitants of the two groups are totally unlike; those of\r\nthe Cape de Verd Islands bearing the impress of Africa, as the\r\ninhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago are stamped with that of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet noticed by far the most remarkable feature in the\r\nnatural history of this archipelago; it is, that the different islands\r\nto a considerable extent are inhabited by a different set of beings. My\r\nattention was first called to this fact by the Vice-Governor, Mr.\r\nLawson, declaring that the tortoises differed from the different\r\nislands, and that he could with certainty tell from which island any\r\none was brought.  I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to\r\nthis statement, and I had already partially mingled together the\r\ncollections from two of the islands.  I never dreamed that islands,\r\nabout 50 or 60 miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other,\r\nformed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar\r\nclimate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently\r\ntenanted; but we shall soon see that this is the case.  It is the fate\r\nof most voyagers, no sooner to discover what is most interesting in any\r\nlocality, than they are hurried from it; but I ought, perhaps, to be\r\nthankful that I obtained sufficient materials to establish this most\r\nremarkable fact in the distribution of organic beings.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, as I have said, state that they can distinguish the\r\ntortoises from the different islands; and that they differ not only in\r\nsize, but in other characters.  Captain Porter has described [5] those\r\nfrom Charles and from the nearest island to it, namely, Hood Island, as\r\nhaving their shells in front thick and turned up like a Spanish saddle,\r\nwhilst the tortoises from James Island are rounder, blacker, and have a\r\nbetter taste when cooked.  M. Bibron, moreover, informs me that he has\r\nseen what he considers two distinct species of tortoise from the\r\nGalapagos, but he does not know from which islands.  The specimens that\r\nI brought from three islands were young ones: and probably owing to\r\nthis cause neither Mr. Gray nor myself could find in them any specific\r\ndifferences.  I have remarked that the marine Amblyrhynchus was larger\r\nat Albemarle Island than elsewhere; and M. Bibron informs me that he\r\nhas seen two distinct aquatic species of this genus; so that the\r\ndifferent islands probably have their representative species or races\r\nof the Amblyrhynchus, as well as of the tortoise.  My attention was\r\nfirst thoroughly aroused, by comparing together the numerous specimens,\r\nshot by myself and several other parties on board, of the\r\nmocking-thrushes, when, to my astonishment, I discovered that all those\r\nfrom Charles Island belonged to one species (Mimus trifasciatus) all\r\nfrom Albemarle Island to M. parvulus; and all from James and Chatham\r\nIslands (between which two other islands are situated, as connecting\r\nlinks) belonged to M. melanotis.  These two latter species are closely\r\nallied, and would by some ornithologists be considered as only\r\nwell-marked races or varieties; but the Mimus trifasciatus is very\r\ndistinct. Unfortunately most of the specimens of the finch tribe were\r\nmingled together; but I have strong reasons to suspect that some of the\r\nspecies of the sub-group Geospiza are confined to separate islands.  If\r\nthe different islands have their representatives of Geospiza, it may\r\nhelp to explain the singularly large number of the species of this\r\nsub-group in this one small archipelago, and as a probable consequence\r\nof their numbers, the perfectly graduated series in the size of their\r\nbeaks.  Two species of the sub-group Cactornis, and two of the\r\nCamarhynchus, were procured in the archipelago; and of the numerous\r\nspecimens of these two sub-groups shot by four collectors at James\r\nIsland, all were found to belong to one species of each; whereas the\r\nnumerous specimens shot either on Chatham or Charles Island (for the\r\ntwo sets were mingled together) all belonged to the two other species:\r\nhence we may feel almost sure that these islands possess their\r\nrespective species of these two sub-groups.  In land-shells this law of\r\ndistribution does not appear to hold good. In my very small collection\r\nof insects, Mr. Waterhouse remarks, that of those which were ticketed\r\nwith their locality, not one was common to any two of the islands.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to the Flora, we shall find the aboriginal plants of the\r\ndifferent islands wonderfully different.  I give all the following\r\nresults on the high authority of my friend Dr. J. Hooker.  I may\r\npremise that I indiscriminately collected everything in flower on the\r\ndifferent islands, and fortunately kept my collections separate.  Too\r\nmuch confidence, however, must not be placed in the proportional\r\nresults, as the small collections brought home by some other\r\nnaturalists though in some respects confirming the results, plainly\r\nshow that much remains to be done in the botany of this group: the\r\nLeguminosae, moreover, has as yet been only approximately worked out:--\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                                         Number of\r\n                                                         Species\r\n                                                         confined\r\n                                                         to the\r\n                      Number of   Number of              Galapagos\r\n                      species     species      Number    Archipelago\r\n             Total    found in    confined     confined  but found\r\n  Name       Number   other       to the       to the    on more\r\n  of         of       parts of    Galapagos    one       than the\r\n  Island     Species  the world   Archipelago  island    one island\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  James      71       33          38           30        8\r\n  Albemarle  46       18          26           22        4\r\n  Chatham    32       16          16           12        4\r\n  Charles    68       39          29           21        8\r\n                   (or 29, if\r\n                   the probably\r\n                   imported\r\n                   plants be\r\n                   subtracted.)\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHence we have the truly wonderful fact, that in James Island, of the\r\nthirty-eight Galapageian plants, or those found in no other part of the\r\nworld, thirty are exclusively confined to this one island; and in\r\nAlbemarle Island, of the twenty-six aboriginal Galapageian plants,\r\ntwenty-two are confined to this one island, that is, only four are at\r\npresent known to grow in the other islands of the archipelago; and so\r\non, as shown in the above table, with the plants from Chatham and\r\nCharles Islands.  This fact will, perhaps, be rendered even more\r\nstriking, by giving a few illustrations:--thus, Scalesia, a remarkable\r\narborescent genus of the Compositae, is confined to the archipelago: it\r\nhas six species: one from Chatham, one from Albemarle, one from Charles\r\nIsland, two from James Island, and the sixth from one of the three\r\nlatter islands, but it is not known from which: not one of these six\r\nspecies grows on any two islands.  Again, Euphorbia, a mundane or\r\nwidely distributed genus, has here eight species, of which seven are\r\nconfined to the archipelago, and not one found on any two islands:\r\nAcalypha and Borreria, both mundane genera, have respectively six and\r\nseven species, none of which have the same species on two islands, with\r\nthe exception of one Borreria, which does occur on two islands. The\r\nspecies of the Compositae are particularly local; and Dr. Hooker has\r\nfurnished me with several other most striking illustrations of the\r\ndifference of the species on the different islands.  He remarks that\r\nthis law of distribution holds good both with those genera confined to\r\nthe archipelago, and those distributed in other quarters of the world:\r\nin like manner we have seen that the different islands have their\r\nproper species of the mundane genus of tortoise, and of the widely\r\ndistributed American genus of the mocking-thrush, as well as of two of\r\nthe Galapageian sub-groups of finches, and almost certainly of the\r\nGalapageian genus Amblyrhynchus.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the tenants of this archipelago would not be nearly\r\nso wonderful, if, for instance, one island had a mocking-thrush, and a\r\nsecond island some other quite distinct genus,--if one island had its\r\ngenus of lizard, and a second island another distinct genus, or none\r\nwhatever;--or if the different islands were inhabited, not by\r\nrepresentative species of the same genera of plants, but by totally\r\ndifferent genera, as does to a certain extent hold good: for, to give\r\none instance, a large berry-bearing tree at James Island has no\r\nrepresentative species in Charles Island.  But it is the circumstance,\r\nthat several of the islands possess their own species of the tortoise,\r\nmocking-thrush, finches, and numerous plants, these species having the\r\nsame general habits, occupying analogous situations, and obviously\r\nfilling the same place in the natural economy of this archipelago, that\r\nstrikes me with wonder.  It may be suspected that some of these\r\nrepresentative species, at least in the case of the tortoise and of\r\nsome of the birds, may hereafter prove to be only well-marked races;\r\nbut this would be of equally great interest to the philosophical\r\nnaturalist.  I have said that most of the islands are in sight of each\r\nother: I may specify that Charles Island is fifty miles from the\r\nnearest part of Chatham Island, and thirty-three miles from the nearest\r\npart of Albemarle Island.  Chatham Island is sixty miles from the\r\nnearest part of James Island, but there are two intermediate islands\r\nbetween them which were not visited by me.  James Island is only ten\r\nmiles from the nearest part of Albemarle Island, but the two points\r\nwhere the collections were made are thirty-two miles apart.  I must\r\nrepeat, that neither the nature of the soil, nor height of the land,\r\nnor the climate, nor the general character of the associated beings,\r\nand therefore their action one on another, can differ much in the\r\ndifferent islands.  If there be any sensible difference in their\r\nclimates, it must be between the Windward group (namely, Charles and\r\nChatham Islands), and that to leeward; but there seems to be no\r\ncorresponding difference in the productions of these two halves of the\r\narchipelago.\r\n\r\nThe only light which I can throw on this remarkable difference in the\r\ninhabitants of the different islands, is, that very strong currents of\r\nthe sea running in a westerly and W.N.W. direction must separate, as\r\nfar as transportal by the sea is concerned, the southern islands from\r\nthe northern ones; and between these northern islands a strong N.W.\r\ncurrent was observed, which must effectually separate James and\r\nAlbemarle Islands.  As the archipelago is free to a most remarkable\r\ndegree from gales of wind, neither the birds, insects, nor lighter\r\nseeds, would be blown from island to island.  And lastly, the profound\r\ndepth of the ocean between the islands, and their apparently recent (in\r\na geological sense) volcanic origin, render it highly unlikely that\r\nthey were ever united; and this, probably, is a far more important\r\nconsideration than any other, with respect to the geographical\r\ndistribution of their inhabitants.  Reviewing the facts here given, one\r\nis astonished at the amount of creative force, if such an expression\r\nmay be used, displayed on these small, barren, and rocky islands; and\r\nstill more so, at its diverse yet analogous action on points so near\r\neach other.  I have said that the Galapagos Archipelago might be called\r\na satellite attached to America, but it should rather be called a group\r\nof satellites, physically similar, organically distinct, yet intimately\r\nrelated to each other, and all related in a marked, though much lesser\r\ndegree, to the great American continent.\r\n\r\nI will conclude my description of the natural history of these islands,\r\nby giving an account of the extreme tameness of the birds.\r\n\r\nThis disposition is common to all the terrestrial species; namely, to\r\nthe mocking-thrushes, the finches, wrens, tyrant-flycatchers, the dove,\r\nand carrion-buzzard.  All of them are often approached sufficiently\r\nnear to be killed with a switch, and sometimes, as I myself tried, with\r\na cap or hat.  A gun is here almost superfluous; for with the muzzle I\r\npushed a hawk off the branch of a tree.  One day, whilst lying down, a\r\nmocking-thrush alighted on the edge of a pitcher, made of the shell of\r\na tortoise, which I held in my hand, and began very quietly to sip the\r\nwater; it allowed me to lift it from the ground whilst seated on the\r\nvessel: I often tried, and very nearly succeeded, in catching these\r\nbirds by their legs. Formerly the birds appear to have been even tamer\r\nthan at present.  Cowley (in the year 1684) says that the \"Turtledoves\r\nwere so tame, that they would often alight on our hats and arms, so as\r\nthat we could take them alive, they not fearing man, until such time as\r\nsome of our company did fire at them, whereby they were rendered more\r\nshy.\" Dampier also, in the same year, says that a man in a morning's\r\nwalk might kill six or seven dozen of these doves.  At present,\r\nalthough certainly very tame, they do not alight on people's arms, nor\r\ndo they suffer themselves to be killed in such large numbers.  It is\r\nsurprising that they have not become wilder; for these islands during\r\nthe last hundred and fifty  years have been frequently visited by\r\nbucaniers and whalers; and the sailors, wandering through the wood in\r\nsearch of tortoises, always take cruel delight in knocking down the\r\nlittle birds. These birds, although now still more persecuted, do not\r\nreadily become wild.  In Charles Island, which had then been colonized\r\nabout six years, I saw a boy sitting by a well with a switch in his\r\nhand, with which he killed the doves and finches as they came to drink.\r\nHe had already procured a little heap of them for his dinner, and he\r\nsaid that he had constantly been in the habit of waiting by this well\r\nfor the same purpose.  It would appear that the birds of this\r\narchipelago, not having as yet learnt that man is a more dangerous\r\nanimal than the tortoise or the Amblyrhynchus, disregard him, in the\r\nsame manner as in England shy birds, such as magpies, disregard the\r\ncows and horses grazing in our fields.\r\n\r\nThe Falkland Islands offer a second instance of birds with a similar\r\ndisposition.  The extraordinary tameness of the little Opetiorhynchus\r\nhas been remarked by Pernety, Lesson, and other voyagers.  It is not,\r\nhowever, peculiar to that bird: the Polyborus, snipe, upland and\r\nlowland goose, thrush, bunting, and even some true hawks, are all more\r\nor less tame.  As the birds are so tame there, where foxes, hawks, and\r\nowls occur, we may infer that the absence of all rapacious animals at\r\nthe Galapagos, is not the cause of their tameness here.  The upland\r\ngeese at the Falklands show, by the precaution they take in building on\r\nthe islets, that they are aware of their danger from the foxes; but\r\nthey are not by this rendered wild towards man.  This tameness of the\r\nbirds, especially of the water-fowl, is strongly contrasted with the\r\nhabits of the same species in Tierra del Fuego, where for ages past\r\nthey have been persecuted by the wild inhabitants. In the Falklands,\r\nthe sportsman may sometimes kill more of the upland geese in one day\r\nthan he can carry home; whereas in Tierra del Fuego it is nearly as\r\ndifficult to kill one, as it is in England to shoot the common wild\r\ngoose.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Pernety (1763), all the birds there appear to have been\r\nmuch tamer than at present; he states that the Opetiorhynchus would\r\nalmost perch on his finger; and that with a wand he killed ten in half\r\nan hour.  At that period the birds must have been about as tame as they\r\nnow are at the Galapagos.  They appear to have learnt caution more\r\nslowly at these latter islands than at the Falklands, where they have\r\nhad proportionate means of experience; for besides frequent visits from\r\nvessels, those islands have been at intervals colonized during the\r\nentire period.  Even formerly, when all the birds were so tame, it was\r\nimpossible by Pernety's account to kill the black-necked swan--a bird\r\nof passage, which probably brought with it the wisdom learnt in foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nI may add that, according to Du Bois, all the birds at Bourbon in\r\n1571-72, with the exception of the flamingoes and geese, were so\r\nextremely tame, that they could be caught by the hand, or killed in any\r\nnumber with a stick.  Again, at Tristan d'Acunha in the Atlantic,\r\nCarmichael [6] states that the only two land-birds, a thrush and a\r\nbunting, were \"so tame as to suffer themselves to be caught with a\r\nhand-net.\" From these several facts we may, I think, conclude, first,\r\nthat the wildness of birds with regard to man, is a particular instinct\r\ndirected against _him_, and not dependent upon any general degree of\r\ncaution arising from other sources of danger; secondly, that it is not\r\nacquired by individual birds in a short time, even when much\r\npersecuted; but that in the course of successive generations it becomes\r\nhereditary.  With domesticated animals we are accustomed to see new\r\nmental habits or instincts acquired or rendered hereditary; but with\r\nanimals in a state of nature, it must always be most difficult to\r\ndiscover instances of acquired hereditary knowledge.  In regard to the\r\nwildness of birds towards man, there is no way of accounting for it,\r\nexcept as an inherited habit: comparatively few young birds, in any one\r\nyear, have been injured by man in England, yet almost all, even\r\nnestlings, are afraid of him; many individuals, on the other hand, both\r\nat the Galapagos and at the Falklands, have been pursued and injured by\r\nman, yet have not learned a salutary dread of him.  We may infer from\r\nthese facts, what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must\r\ncause in a country, before the instincts of the indigenous inhabitants\r\nhave become adapted to the stranger's craft or power.\r\n\r\n[1] The progress of research has shown that some of these birds, which\r\nwere then thought to be confined to the islands, occur on the American\r\ncontinent.  The eminent ornithologist, Mr. Sclater, informs me that\r\nthis is the case with the Strix punctatissima and Pyrocephalus nanus;\r\nand probably with the Otus Galapagoensis and Zenaida Galapagoensis: so\r\nthat the number of endemic birds is reduced to twenty-three, or\r\nprobably to twenty-one.  Mr. Sclater thinks that one or two of these\r\nendemic forms should be ranked rather as varieties than species, which\r\nalways seemed to me probable.\r\n\r\n[2] This is stated by Dr. Gunther (Zoolog. Soc. Jan 24th, 1859) to be a\r\npeculiar species, not known to inhabit any other country.\r\n\r\n[3] Voyage aux Quatre Iles d'Afrique.  With respect to the Sandwich\r\nIslands, see Tyerman and Bennett's Journal, vol. i. p. 434.  For\r\nMauritius, see Voyage par un Officier, etc., part i. p. 170.  There are\r\nno frogs in the Canary Islands (Webb et Berthelot, Hist. Nat. des Iles\r\nCanaries).  I saw none at St. Jago in the Cape de Verds.  There are\r\nnone at St. Helena.\r\n\r\n[4] Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist., vol. xvi. p. 19.\r\n\r\n[5] Voyage in the U. S. ship Essex, vol. i. p. 215.\r\n\r\n[6] Linn. Trans., vol. xii. p. 496.  The most anomalous fact on this\r\nsubject which I have met with is the wildness of the small birds in the\r\nArctic parts of North America (as described by Richardson, Fauna Bor.,\r\nvol. ii. p. 332), where they are said never to be persecuted.  This\r\ncase is the more strange, because it is asserted that some of the same\r\nspecies in their winter-quarters in the United States are tame.  There\r\nis much, as Dr. Richardson well remarks, utterly inexplicable connected\r\nwith the different degrees of shyness and care with which birds conceal\r\ntheir nests.  How strange it is that the English wood-pigeon, generally\r\nso wild a bird, should very frequently rear its young in shrubberies\r\nclose to houses!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTAHITI AND NEW ZEALAND\r\n\r\nPass through the Low Archipelago--Tahiti--Aspect--Vegetation on the\r\nMountains--View of Eimeo--Excursion into the Interior--Profound\r\nRavines--Succession of Waterfalls--Number of wild useful\r\nPlants--Temperance of the Inhabitants--Their moral state--Parliament\r\nconvened--New Zealand--Bay of Islands--Hippahs--Excursion to\r\nWaimate--Missionary Establishment--English Weeds now run\r\nwild--Waiomio--Funeral of a New Zealand Woman--Sail for Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 20th.--The survey of the Galapagos Archipelago being concluded,\r\nwe steered towards Tahiti and commenced our long passage of 3200 miles.\r\nIn the course of a few days we sailed out of the gloomy and clouded\r\nocean-district which extends during the winter far from the coast of\r\nSouth America.  We then enjoyed bright and clear weather, while running\r\npleasantly along at the rate of 150 or 160 miles a day before the\r\nsteady trade-wind. The temperature in this more central part of the\r\nPacific is higher than near the American shore.  The thermometer in the\r\npoop cabin, by night and day, ranged between 80 and 83 degs., which\r\nfeels very pleasant; but with one degree or two higher, the heat\r\nbecomes oppressive.  We passed through the Low or Dangerous\r\nArchipelago, and saw several of those most curious rings of coral land,\r\njust rising above the water's edge, which have been called Lagoon\r\nIslands.  A long and brilliantly white beach is capped by a margin of\r\ngreen vegetation; and the strip, looking either way, rapidly narrows\r\naway in the distance, and sinks beneath the horizon From the mast-head\r\na wide expanse of smooth water can be seen within the ring.  These low\r\nhollow coral islands bear no proportion to the vast ocean out of which\r\nthey abruptly rise; and it seems wonderful, that such weak invaders are\r\nnot overwhelmed, by the all-powerful and never-tiring waves of that\r\ngreat sea, miscalled the Pacific.\r\n\r\nNovember 15th.--At daylight, Tahiti, an island which must for ever\r\nremain classical to the voyager in the South Sea, was in view.  At a\r\ndistance the appearance was not attractive.  The luxuriant vegetation\r\nof the lower part could not yet be seen, and as the clouds rolled past,\r\nthe wildest and most precipitous peaks showed themselves towards the\r\ncentre of the island.  As soon as we anchored in Matavai Bay, we were\r\nsurrounded by canoes.  This was our Sunday, but the Monday of Tahiti:\r\nif the case had been reversed, we should not have received a single\r\nvisit; for the injunction not to launch a canoe on the sabbath is\r\nrigidly obeyed. After dinner we landed to enjoy all the delights\r\nproduced by the first impressions of a new country, and that country\r\nthe charming Tahiti.  A crowd of men, women, and children, was\r\ncollected on the memorable Point Venus, ready to receive us with\r\nlaughing, merry faces.  They marshalled us towards the house of Mr.\r\nWilson, the missionary of the district, who met us on the road, and\r\ngave us a very friendly reception.  After sitting a very short time in\r\nhis house, we separated to walk about, but returned there in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThe land capable of cultivation, is scarcely in any part more than a\r\nfringe of low alluvial soil, accumulated round the base of the\r\nmountains, and protected from the waves of the sea by a coral reef,\r\nwhich encircles the entire line of coast.  Within the reef there is an\r\nexpanse of smooth water, like that of a lake, where the canoes of the\r\nnatives can ply with safety and where ships anchor.  The low land which\r\ncomes down to the beach of coral-sand, is covered by the most beautiful\r\nproductions of the intertropical regions.  In the midst of bananas,\r\norange, cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit trees, spots are cleared where yams,\r\nsweet potatoes, and sugar-cane, and pine-apples are cultivated.  Even\r\nthe brushwood is an imported fruit-tree, namely, the guava, which from\r\nits abundance has become as noxious as a weed.  In Brazil I have often\r\nadmired the varied beauty of the bananas, palms, and orange-trees\r\ncontrasted together; and here we also have the bread-fruit, conspicuous\r\nfrom its large, glossy, and deeply digitated leaf.  It is admirable to\r\nbehold groves of a tree, sending forth its branches with the vigour of\r\nan English oak, loaded with large and most nutritious fruit.  However\r\nseldom the usefulness of an object can account for the pleasure of\r\nbeholding it, in the case of these beautiful woods, the knowledge of\r\ntheir high productiveness no doubt enters largely into the feeling of\r\nadmiration.  The little winding paths, cool from the surrounding shade,\r\nled to the scattered houses; the owners of which everywhere gave us a\r\ncheerful and most hospitable reception.\r\n\r\nI was pleased with nothing so much as with the inhabitants. There is a\r\nmildness in the expression of their countenances which at once banishes\r\nthe idea of a savage; and intelligence which shows that they are\r\nadvancing in civilization.  The common people, when working, keep the\r\nupper part of their bodies quite naked; and it is then that the\r\nTahitians are seen to advantage.  They are very tall, broad-shouldered,\r\nathletic, and well-proportioned.  It has been remarked, that it\r\nrequires little habit to make a dark skin more pleasing and natural to\r\nthe eye of an European than his own colour.  A white man bathing by the\r\nside of a Tahitian, was like a plant bleached by the gardener's art\r\ncompared with a fine dark green one growing vigorously in the open\r\nfields.  Most of the men are tattooed, and the ornaments follow the\r\ncurvature of the body so gracefully, that they have a very elegant\r\neffect.  One common pattern, varying in its details, is somewhat like\r\nthe crown of a palm-tree. It springs from the central line of the back,\r\nand gracefully curls round both sides.  The simile may be a fanciful\r\none, but I thought the body of a man thus ornamented was like the trunk\r\nof a noble tree embraced by a delicate creeper.\r\n\r\nMany of the elder people had their feet covered with small figures, so\r\nplaced as to resemble a sock.  This fashion, however, is partly gone\r\nby, and has been succeeded by others. Here, although fashion is far\r\nfrom immutable, every one must abide by that prevailing in his youth.\r\nAn old man has thus his age for ever stamped on his body, and he cannot\r\nassume the airs of a young dandy.  The women are tattooed in the same\r\nmanner as the men, and very commonly on their fingers.  One unbecoming\r\nfashion is now almost universal: namely, shaving the hair from the\r\nupper part of the head, in a circular form, so as to leave only an\r\nouter ring.  The missionaries have tried to persuade the people to\r\nchange this habit; but it is the fashion, and that is a sufficient\r\nanswer at Tahiti, as well as at Paris.  I was much disappointed in the\r\npersonal appearance of the women: they are far inferior in every\r\nrespect to the men.  The custom of wearing a white or scarlet flower in\r\nthe back of the head, or through a small hole in each ear, is pretty. A\r\ncrown of woven cocoa-nut leaves is also worn as a shade for the eyes.\r\nThe women appear to be in greater want of some becoming costume even\r\nthan the men.\r\n\r\nNearly all the natives understand a little English--that is, they know\r\nthe names of common things; and by the aid of this, together with\r\nsigns, a lame sort of conversation could be carried on.  In returning\r\nin the evening to the boat, we stopped to witness a very pretty scene.\r\nNumbers of children were playing on the beach, and had lighted bonfires\r\nwhich illumined the placid sea and surrounding trees; others, in\r\ncircles, were singing Tahitian verses.  We seated ourselves on the\r\nsand, and joined their party.  The songs were impromptu, and I believe\r\nrelated to our arrival: one little girl sang a line, which the rest\r\ntook up in parts, forming a very pretty chorus.  The whole scene made\r\nus unequivocally aware that we were seated on the shores of an island\r\nin the far-famed South Sea.\r\n\r\n17th.--This day is reckoned in the log-book as Tuesday the 17th,\r\ninstead of Monday the 16th, owing to our, so far, successful chase of\r\nthe sun.  Before breakfast the ship was hemmed in by a flotilla of\r\ncanoes; and when the natives were allowed to come on board, I suppose\r\nthere could not have been less than two hundred.  It was the opinion of\r\nevery one that it would have been difficult to have picked out an equal\r\nnumber from any other nation, who would have given so little trouble.\r\nEverybody brought something for sale: shells were the main articles of\r\ntrade.  The Tahitians now fully understand the value of money, and\r\nprefer it to old clothes or other articles.  The various coins,\r\nhowever, of English and Spanish denomination puzzle them, and they\r\nnever seemed to think the small silver quite secure until changed into\r\ndollars.  Some of the chiefs have accumulated considerable sums of\r\nmoney.  One chief, not long since, offered 800 dollars (about 160\r\npounds sterling) for a small vessel; and frequently they purchase\r\nwhale-boats and horses at the rate of from 50 to 100 dollars.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I went on shore, and ascended the nearest slope to a\r\nheight of between two and three thousand feet. The outer mountains are\r\nsmooth and conical, but steep; and the old volcanic rocks, of which\r\nthey are formed, have been cut through by many profound ravines,\r\ndiverging from the central broken parts of the island to the coast.\r\nHaving crossed the narrow low girt of inhabited and fertile land, I\r\nfollowed a smooth steep ridge between two of the deep ravines.  The\r\nvegetation was singular, consisting almost exclusively of small dwarf\r\nferns, mingled higher up, with coarse grass; it was not very dissimilar\r\nfrom that on some of the Welsh hills, and this so close above the\r\norchard of tropical plants on the coast was very surprising.  At the\r\nhighest point, which I reached, trees again appeared.  Of the three\r\nzones of comparative luxuriance, the lower one owes its moisture, and\r\ntherefore fertility, to its flatness; for, being scarcely raised above\r\nthe level of the sea, the water from the higher land drains away\r\nslowly.  The intermediate zone does not, like the upper one, reach into\r\na damp and cloudy atmosphere, and therefore remains sterile.  The woods\r\nin the upper zone are very pretty, tree-ferns replacing the cocoa-nuts\r\non the coast.  It must not, however, be supposed that these woods at\r\nall equal in splendour the forests of Brazil.  The vast numbers of\r\nproductions, which characterize a continent, cannot be expected to\r\noccur in an island.\r\n\r\nFrom the highest point which I attained, there was a good view of the\r\ndistant island of Eimeo, dependent on the same sovereign with Tahiti.\r\nOn the lofty and broken pinnacles, white massive clouds were piled up,\r\nwhich formed an island in the blue sky, as Eimeo itself did in the blue\r\nocean.  The island, with the exception of one small gateway, is\r\ncompletely encircled by a reef.  At this distance, a narrow but\r\nwell-defined brilliantly white line was alone visible, where the waves\r\nfirst encountered the wall of coral.  The mountains rose abruptly out\r\nof the glassy expanse of the lagoon, included within this narrow white\r\nline, outside which the heaving waters of the ocean were dark-coloured.\r\nThe view was striking: it may aptly be compared to a framed engraving,\r\nwhere the frame represents the breakers, the marginal paper the smooth\r\nlagoon, and the drawing the island itself.  When in the evening I\r\ndescended from the mountain, a man, whom I had pleased with a trifling\r\ngift, met me, bringing with him hot roasted bananas, a pine-apple, and\r\ncocoa-nuts.  After walking under a burning sun, I do not know anything\r\nmore delicious than the milk of a young cocoa-nut.  Pine-apples are\r\nhere so abundant that the people eat them in the same wasteful manner\r\nas we might turnips.  They are of an excellent flavor--perhaps even\r\nbetter than those cultivated in England; and this I believe is the\r\nhighest compliment which can be paid to any fruit.  Before going on\r\nboard, Mr. Wilson interpreted for me to the Tahitian who had paid me so\r\nadroit an attention, that I wanted him and another man to accompany me\r\non a short excursion into the mountains.\r\n\r\n18th.--In the morning I came on shore early, bringing with me some\r\nprovisions in a bag, and two blankets for myself and servant.  These\r\nwere lashed to each end of a long pole, which was alternately carried\r\nby my Tahitian companions on their shoulders.  These men are accustomed\r\nthus to carry, for a whole day, as much as fifty pounds at each end of\r\ntheir poles.  I told my guides to provide themselves with food and\r\nclothing; but they said that there was plenty of food in the mountains,\r\nand for clothing, that their skins were sufficient.  Our line of march\r\nwas the valley of Tiaauru, down which a river flows into the sea by\r\nPoint Venus. This is one of the principal streams in the island, and\r\nits source lies at the base of the loftiest central pinnacles, which\r\nrise to a height of about 7000 feet.  The whole island is so\r\nmountainous that the only way to penetrate into the interior is to\r\nfollow up the valleys.  Our road, at first, lay through woods which\r\nbordered each side of the river; and the glimpses of the lofty central\r\npeaks, seen as through an avenue, with here and there a waving\r\ncocoa-nut tree on one side, were extremely picturesque.  The valley\r\nsoon began to narrow, and the sides to grow lofty and more precipitous.\r\nAfter having walked between three and four hours, we found the width of\r\nthe ravine scarcely exceeded that of the bed of the stream.  On each\r\nhand the walls were nearly vertical, yet from the soft nature of the\r\nvolcanic strata, trees and a rank vegetation sprung from every\r\nprojecting ledge. These precipices must have been some thousand feet\r\nhigh; and the whole formed a mountain gorge far more magnificent than\r\nanything which I had ever before beheld.  Until the midday sun stood\r\nvertically over the ravine, the air felt cool and damp, but now it\r\nbecame very sultry.  Shaded by a ledge of rock, beneath a facade of\r\ncolumnar lava, we ate our dinner.  My guides had already procured a\r\ndish of small fish and fresh-water prawns.  They carried with them a\r\nsmall net stretched on a hoop; and where the water was deep and in\r\neddies, they dived, and like otters, with their eyes open followed the\r\nfish into holes and corners, and thus caught them.\r\n\r\nThe Tahitians have the dexterity of amphibious animals in the water. An\r\nanecdote mentioned by Ellis shows how much they feel at home in this\r\nelement.  When a horse was landing for Pomarre in 1817, the slings\r\nbroke, and it fell into the water; immediately the natives jumped\r\noverboard, and by their cries and vain efforts at assistance almost\r\ndrowned it.  As soon, however, as it reached the shore, the whole\r\npopulation took to flight, and tried to hide themselves from the\r\nman-carrying pig, as they christened the horse.\r\n\r\nA little higher up, the river divided itself into three little streams.\r\nThe two northern ones were impracticable, owing to a succession of\r\nwaterfalls which descended from the jagged summit of the highest\r\nmountain; the other to all appearance was equally inaccessible, but we\r\nmanaged to ascend it by a most extraordinary road.  The sides of the\r\nvalley were here nearly precipitous, but, as frequently happens with\r\nstratified rocks, small ledges projected, which were thickly covered by\r\nwild bananas, lilaceous plants, and other luxuriant productions of the\r\ntropics.  The Tahitians, by climbing amongst these ledges, searching\r\nfor fruit, had discovered a track by which the whole precipice could be\r\nscaled. The first ascent from the valley was very dangerous; for it was\r\nnecessary to pass a steeply inclined face of naked rock, by  the aid of\r\nropes which we brought with us.  How any person discovered that this\r\nformidable spot was the only point where the side of the mountain was\r\npracticable, I cannot imagine.  We then cautiously walked along one of\r\nthe ledges till we came to one of the three streams.  This ledge formed\r\na flat spot, above which a beautiful cascade, some hundred feet in\r\nheight, poured down its waters, and beneath, another high cascade fell\r\ninto the main stream in the valley below.  From this cool and shady\r\nrecess we made a circuit to avoid the overhanging waterfall.  As\r\nbefore, we followed little projecting ledges, the danger being partly\r\nconcealed by the thickness of the vegetation.  In passing from one of\r\nthe ledges to another, there was a vertical wall of rock.  One of the\r\nTahitians, a fine active man, placed the trunk of a tree against this,\r\nclimbed up it, and then by the aid of crevices reached the summit.  He\r\nfixed the ropes to a projecting point, and lowered them for our dog and\r\nluggage, and then we clambered up ourselves.  Beneath the ledge on\r\nwhich the dead tree was placed, the precipice must have been five or\r\nsix hundred feet deep; and if the abyss had not been partly concealed\r\nby the overhanging ferns and lilies my head would have turned giddy,\r\nand nothing should have induced me to have attempted it.  We continued\r\nto ascend, sometimes along ledges, and sometimes along knife-edged\r\nridges, having on each hand profound ravines.  In the Cordillera I have\r\nseen mountains on a far grander scale, but for abruptness, nothing at\r\nall comparable with this. In the evening we reached a flat little spot\r\non the banks of the same stream, which we had continued to follow, and\r\nwhich descends in a chain of waterfalls: here we bivouacked for the\r\nnight.  On each side of the ravine there were great beds of the\r\nmountain-banana, covered with ripe fruit.  Many of these plants were\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five feet high, and from three to four in\r\ncircumference.  By the aid of strips of bark for rope, the stems of\r\nbamboos for rafters, and the large leaf of the banana for a thatch, the\r\nTahitians in a few minutes built us an excellent house; and with\r\nwithered leaves made a soft bed.\r\n\r\nThey then proceeded to make a fire, and cook our evening meal.  A light\r\nwas procured, by rubbing a blunt pointed stick in a groove made in\r\nanother, as if with intention of deepening it, until by the friction\r\nthe dust became ignited. A peculiarly white and very light wood (the\r\nHibiscus tiliareus) is alone used for this purpose: it is the same\r\nwhich serves for poles to carry any burden, and for the floating\r\nout-riggers to their canoes.  The fire was produced in a few seconds:\r\nbut to a person who does not understand the art, it requires, as I\r\nfound, the greatest exertion; but at last, to my great pride, I\r\nsucceeded in igniting the dust.  The Gaucho in the Pampas uses a\r\ndifferent method: taking an elastic stick about eighteen inches long,\r\nhe presses one end on his breast, and the other pointed end into a hole\r\nin a piece of wood, and then rapidly turns the curved part, like a\r\ncarpenter's centre-bit.  The Tahitians having made a small fire of\r\nsticks, placed a score of stones, of about the size of cricket-balls,\r\non the burning wood.  In about ten minutes the sticks were consumed,\r\nand the stones hot.  They had previously folded up in small parcels of\r\nleaves, pieces of beef, fish, ripe and unripe bananas, and the tops of\r\nthe wild arum. These green parcels were laid in a layer between two\r\nlayers of the hot stones, and the whole then covered up with earth, so\r\nthat no smoke or steam could escape.  In about a quarter of an hour,\r\nthe whole was most deliciously cooked. The choice green parcels were\r\nnow laid on a cloth of banana leaves, and with a cocoa-nut shell we\r\ndrank the cool water of the running stream; and thus we enjoyed our\r\nrustic meal.\r\n\r\nI could not look on the surrounding plants without admiration. On every\r\nside were forests of banana; the fruit of which, though serving for\r\nfood in various ways, lay in heaps decaying on the ground.  In front of\r\nus there was an extensive brake of wild sugar-cane; and the stream was\r\nshaded by the dark green knotted stem of the Ava,--so famous in former\r\ndays for its powerful intoxicating effects.  I chewed a piece, and\r\nfound that it had an acrid and unpleasant taste, which would have\r\ninduced any one at once to have pronounced it poisonous.  Thanks to the\r\nmissionaries, this plant now thrives only in these deep ravines,\r\ninnocuous to every one.  Close by I saw the wild arum, the roots of\r\nwhich, when well baked, are good to eat, and the young leaves better\r\nthan spinach.  There was the wild yam, and a liliaceous plant called\r\nTi, which grows in abundance, and has a soft brown root, in shape and\r\nsize like a huge log of wood: this served us for dessert, for it is as\r\nsweet as treacle, and  with a pleasant taste.  There were, moreover,\r\nseveral other wild fruits, and useful vegetables.  The little stream,\r\nbesides its cool water, produced eels, and cray-fish.  I did indeed\r\nadmire this scene, when I compared it with an uncultivated one in the\r\ntemperate zones.  I felt the force of the remark, that man, at least\r\nsavage man, with his reasoning powers only partly developed, is the\r\nchild of the tropics.\r\n\r\nAs the evening drew to a close, I strolled beneath the gloomy shade of\r\nthe bananas up the course of the stream. My walk was soon brought to a\r\nclose, by coming to a waterfall between two and three hundred feet\r\nhigh; and again above this there was another.  I mention all these\r\nwaterfalls in this one brook, to give a general idea of the inclination\r\nof the land.  In the little recess where the water fell, it did not\r\nappear that a breath of wind had ever blown.  The thin edges of the\r\ngreat leaves of the banana, damp with spray, were unbroken, instead of\r\nbeing, as is so generally the case, split into a thousand shreds.  From\r\nour position, almost suspended on the mountain side, there were\r\nglimpses into the depths of the neighbouring valleys; and the lofty\r\npoints of the central mountains, towering up within sixty degrees of\r\nthe zenith, hid half the evening sky.  Thus seated, it was a sublime\r\nspectacle to watch the shades of night gradually obscuring the last and\r\nhighest pinnacles.\r\n\r\nBefore we laid ourselves down to sleep, the elder Tahitian fell on his\r\nknees, and with closed eyes repeated a long prayer in his native\r\ntongue.  He prayed as a Christian should do, with fitting reverence,\r\nand without the fear of ridicule or any ostentation of piety.  At our\r\nmeals neither of the men would taste food, without saying beforehand a\r\nshort grace. Those travellers who think that a Tahitian prays only when\r\nthe eyes of the missionary are fixed on him, should have slept with us\r\nthat night on the mountain-side.  Before morning it rained very\r\nheavily; but the good thatch of banana-leaves kept us dry.\r\n\r\nNovember 19th.--At daylight my friends, after their morning prayer,\r\nprepared an excellent breakfast in the same manner as in the evening.\r\nThey themselves certainly partook of it largely; indeed I never saw any\r\nmen eat near so much.  I suppose such enormously capacious stomachs\r\nmust be the effect of a large part of their diet consisting of fruit\r\nand vegetables, which contain, in a given bulk, a comparatively small\r\nportion of nutriment.  Unwittingly, I was the means of my companions\r\nbreaking, as I afterwards learned, one of their own laws, and\r\nresolutions: I took with me a flask of spirits, which they could not\r\nrefuse to partake of; but as often as they drank a little, they put\r\ntheir fingers before their mouths, and uttered the word \"Missionary.\"\r\nAbout two years ago, although the use of the ava was prevented,\r\ndrunkenness from the introduction of spirits became very prevalent. The\r\nmissionaries prevailed on a few good men, who saw that their country\r\nwas rapidly going to ruin, to join with them in a Temperance Society.\r\nFrom good sense or shame, all the chiefs and the queen were at last\r\npersuaded to join.  Immediately a law was passed, that no spirits\r\nshould be allowed to be introduced into the island, and that he who\r\nsold and he who bought the forbidden article should be punished by a\r\nfine.  With remarkable justice, a certain period was allowed for stock\r\nin hand to be sold, before the law came into effect.  But when it did,\r\na general search was made, in which even the houses of the missionaries\r\nwere not exempted, and all the ava (as the natives call all ardent\r\nspirits) was poured on the ground. When one reflects on the effect of\r\nintemperance on the aborigines of the two Americas, I think it will be\r\nacknowledged that every well-wisher of Tahiti owes no common debt of\r\ngratitude to the missionaries.  As long as the little island of St.\r\nHelena remained under the government of the East India Company,\r\nspirits, owing to the great injury they had produced, were not allowed\r\nto be imported; but wine was supplied from the Cape of Good Hope.  It\r\nis rather a striking and not very gratifying fact, that in the same\r\nyear that spirits were allowed to be sold in Helena, their use was\r\nbanished from Tahiti by the free will of the people.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast we proceeded on our Journey.  As my object was merely\r\nto see a little of the interior scenery, we returned by another track,\r\nwhich descended into the main valley lower down.  For some distance we\r\nwound, by a most intricate path, along the side of the mountain which\r\nformed the valley.  In the less precipitous parts we passed through\r\nextensive groves of the wild banana.  The Tahitians, with their naked,\r\ntattooed bodies, their heads ornamented with flowers, and seen in the\r\ndark shade of these groves, would have formed a fine picture of man\r\ninhabiting some primeval land.  In our descent we followed the line of\r\nridges; these were exceedingly narrow, and for considerable lengths\r\nsteep as a ladder; but all clothed with vegetation.  The extreme care\r\nnecessary in poising each step rendered the walk fatiguing. I did not\r\ncease to wonder at these ravines and precipices: when viewing the\r\ncountry from one of the knife-edged ridges, the point of support was so\r\nsmall, that the effect was nearly the same as it must be from a\r\nballoon.  In this descent we had occasion to use the ropes only once,\r\nat the point where we entered the main valley.  We slept under the same\r\nledge of rock where we had dined the day before: the night was fine,\r\nbut from the depth and narrowness of the gorge, profoundly dark.\r\n\r\nBefore actually seeing this country, I found it difficult to understand\r\ntwo facts mentioned by Ellis; namely, that after the murderous battles\r\nof former times, the survivors on the conquered side retired into the\r\nmountains, where a handful of men could resist a multitude.  Certainly\r\nhalf a dozen men, at the spot where the Tahitian reared the old tree,\r\ncould easily have repulsed thousands.  Secondly, that after the\r\nintroduction of Christianity, there were wild men who lived in the\r\nmountains, and whose retreats were unknown to the more civilized\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nNovember 20th.--In the morning we started early, and reached Matavai at\r\nnoon.  On the road we met a large party of noble athletic men, going\r\nfor wild bananas.  I found that the ship, on account of the difficulty\r\nin watering, had moved to the harbour of Papawa, to which place I\r\nimmediately walked.  This is a very pretty spot.  The cove is\r\nsurrounded by reefs, and the water as smooth as in a lake.  The\r\ncultivated ground, with its beautiful productions, interspersed with\r\ncottages, comes close down to the water's edge. From the varying\r\naccounts which I had read before reaching these islands, I was very\r\nanxious to form, from my own observation, a judgment of their moral\r\nstate,--although such judgment would necessarily be very imperfect.\r\nFirst impressions at all times very much depend on one's previously\r\nacquired ideas.  My notions were drawn from Ellis's \"Polynesian\r\nResearches\"--an admirable and most interesting work, but naturally\r\nlooking at everything under a favourable point of view, from Beechey's\r\nVoyage; and from that of Kotzebue, which is strongly adverse to the\r\nwhole missionary system.  He who compares these three accounts will, I\r\nthink, form a tolerably accurate conception of the present state of\r\nTahiti.  One of my impressions which I took from the two last\r\nauthorities, was decidedly incorrect; viz., that the Tahitians had\r\nbecome a gloomy race, and lived in fear of the missionaries.  Of the\r\nlatter feeling I saw no trace, unless, indeed, fear and respect be\r\nconfounded under one name. Instead of discontent being a common\r\nfeeling, it would be difficult in Europe to pick out of a crowd half so\r\nmany merry and happy faces.  The prohibition of the flute and dancing\r\nis inveighed against as wrong and foolish;--the more than presbyterian\r\nmanner of keeping the sabbath is looked at in a similar light.  On\r\nthese points I will not pretend to offer any opinion to men who have\r\nresided as many years as I was days on the island.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, it appears to me that the morality and religion of the\r\ninhabitants are highly creditable.  There are many who attack, even\r\nmore acrimoniously than Kotzebue, both the missionaries, their system,\r\nand the effects produced by it.  Such reasoners never compare the\r\npresent state with that of the island only twenty years ago; nor even\r\nwith that of Europe at this day; but they compare it with the high\r\nstandard of Gospel perfection.  They expect the missionaries to effect\r\nthat which the Apostles themselves failed to do. Inasmuch as the\r\ncondition of the people falls short of this high standard, blame is\r\nattached to the missionary, instead of credit for that which he has\r\neffected.  They forget, or will not remember, that human sacrifices,\r\nand the power of an idolatrous priesthood--a system of profligacy\r\nunparalleled in any other part of the world--infanticide a consequence\r\nof that system--bloody wars, where the conquerors spared neither women\r\nnor children--that all these have been abolished; and that dishonesty,\r\nintemperance, and licentiousness have been greatly reduced by the\r\nintroduction of Christianity. In a voyager to forget these things is\r\nbase ingratitude; for should he chance to be at the point of shipwreck\r\non some unknown coast, he will most devoutly pray that the lesson of\r\nthe missionary may have extended thus far.\r\n\r\nIn point of morality, the virtue of the women, it has been often said,\r\nis most open to exception.  But before they are blamed too severely, it\r\nwill be well distinctly to call to mind the scenes described by Captain\r\nCook and Mr. Banks, in which the grandmothers and mothers of the\r\npresent race played a part.  Those who are most severe, should consider\r\nhow much of the morality of the women in Europe is owing to the system\r\nearly impressed by mothers on their daughters, and how much in each\r\nindividual case to the precepts of religion.  But it is useless to\r\nargue against such reasoners;--I believe that, disappointed in not\r\nfinding the field of licentiousness quite so open as formerly, they\r\nwill not give credit to a morality which they do not wish to practise,\r\nor to a religion which they undervalue, if not despise.\r\n\r\nSunday, 22nd.--The harbour of Papiete, where the queen resides, may be\r\nconsidered as the capital of the island: it is also the seat of\r\ngovernment, and the chief resort of shipping. Captain Fitz Roy took a\r\nparty there this day to hear divine service, first in the Tahitian\r\nlanguage, and afterwards in our own.  Mr. Pritchard, the leading\r\nmissionary in the island, performed the service.  The chapel consisted\r\nof a large airy framework of wood; and it was filled to excess by tidy,\r\nclean people, of all ages and both sexes.  I was rather disappointed in\r\nthe apparent degree of attention; but I believe my expectations were\r\nraised too high.  At all events the appearance was quite equal to that\r\nin a country church in England. The singing of the hymns was decidedly\r\nvery pleasing, but the language from the pulpit, although fluently\r\ndelivered, did not sound well: a constant repetition of words, like\r\n\"tata ta, mata mai,\" rendered it monotonous.  After English service, a\r\nparty returned on foot to Matavai.  It was a pleasant walk, sometimes\r\nalong the sea-beach and sometimes under the shade of the many beautiful\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nAbout two years ago, a small vessel under English colours was plundered\r\nby some of the inhabitants of the Low Islands, which were then under\r\nthe dominion of the Queen of Tahiti. It was believed that the\r\nperpetrators were instigated to this act by some indiscreet laws issued\r\nby her majesty.  The British government demanded compensation; which\r\nwas acceded to, and the sum of nearly three thousand dollars was agreed\r\nto be paid on the first of last September.  The Commodore at Lima\r\nordered Captain Fitz Roy to inquire concerning this debt, and to demand\r\nsatisfaction if it were not paid.  Captain Fitz Roy accordingly\r\nrequested an interview with the Queen Pomarre, since famous from the\r\nill-treatment she had received from the French; and a parliament was\r\nheld to consider the question, at which all the principal chiefs of the\r\nisland and the queen were assembled.  I will not attempt to describe\r\nwhat took place, after the interesting account given by Captain Fitz\r\nRoy.  The money, it appeared, had not been paid; perhaps the alleged\r\nreasons were rather equivocal; but otherwise I cannot sufficiently\r\nexpress our general surprise at the extreme good sense, the reasoning\r\npowers, moderation, candour, and prompt resolution, which were\r\ndisplayed on all sides.  I believe we all left the meeting with a very\r\ndifferent opinion of the Tahitians, from what we entertained when we\r\nentered.  The chiefs and people resolved to subscribe and complete the\r\nsum which was wanting; Captain Fitz Roy urged that it was hard that\r\ntheir private property should be sacrificed for the crimes of distant\r\nislanders.  They replied, that they were grateful for his\r\nconsideration, but that Pomarre was their Queen, and that they were\r\ndetermined to help her in this her difficulty.  This resolution and its\r\nprompt execution, for a book was opened early the next morning, made a\r\nperfect conclusion to this very remarkable scene of loyalty and good\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nAfter the main discussion was ended, several of the chiefs took the\r\nopportunity of asking Captain Fitz Roy many intelligent questions on\r\ninternational customs and laws, relating to the treatment of ships and\r\nforeigners.  On some points, as soon as the decision was made, the law\r\nwas issued verbally on the spot.  This Tahitian parliament lasted for\r\nseveral hours; and when it was over Captain Fitz Roy invited Queen\r\nPomarre to pay the Beagle a visit.\r\n\r\nNovember 25th.--In the evening four boats were sent for her majesty;\r\nthe ship was dressed with flags, and the yards manned on her coming on\r\nboard.  She was accompanied by most of the chiefs.  The behaviour of\r\nall was very proper: they begged for nothing, and seemed much pleased\r\nwith Captain Fitz Roy's presents.  The queen is a large awkward woman,\r\nwithout any beauty, grace or dignity.  She has only one royal\r\nattribute: a perfect immovability of expression under all\r\ncircumstances, and that rather a sullen one.  The rockets were most\r\nadmired, and a deep \"Oh!\" could be heard from the shore, all round the\r\ndark bay, after each explosion.  The sailors' songs were also much\r\nadmired; and the queen said she thought that one of the most boisterous\r\nones certainly could not be a hymn!  The royal party did not return on\r\nshore till past midnight.\r\n\r\n26th.--In the evening, with a gentle land-breeze, a course was steered\r\nfor New Zealand; and as the sun set, we had a farewell view of the\r\nmountains of Tahiti--the island to which every voyager has offered up\r\nhis tribute of admiration.\r\n\r\nDecember 19th.--In the evening we saw in the distance New Zealand. We\r\nmay now consider that we have nearly crossed the Pacific.  It is\r\nnecessary to sail over this great ocean to comprehend its immensity.\r\nMoving quickly onwards for weeks together, we meet with nothing but the\r\nsame blue, profoundly deep, ocean.  Even within the archipelagoes, the\r\nislands are mere specks, and far distant one from the other. Accustomed\r\nto look at maps drawn on a small scale, where dots, shading, and names\r\nare crowded together, we do not rightly judge how infinitely small the\r\nproportion of dry land is to water of this vast expanse. The meridian\r\nof the Antipodes has likewise been passed; and now every league, it\r\nmade us happy to think, was one league nearer to England. These\r\nAntipodes call to one's mind old recollections of childish doubt and\r\nwonder.  Only the other day I looked forward to this airy barrier as a\r\ndefinite point in our voyage homewards; but now I find it, and all such\r\nresting-places for the imagination, are like shadows, which a man\r\nmoving onwards cannot catch.  A gale of wind lasting for some days, has\r\nlately given us full leisure to measure the future stages in our\r\nhomeward voyage, and to wish most earnestly for its termination.\r\n\r\nDecember 21st.--Early in the morning we entered the Bay of Islands, and\r\nbeing becalmed for some hours near the mouth, we did not reach the\r\nanchorage till the middle of the day.  The country is hilly, with a\r\nsmooth outline, and is deeply intersected by numerous arms of the sea\r\nextending from the bay.  The surface appears from a distance as if\r\nclothed with coarse pasture, but this in truth is nothing but fern.  On\r\nthe more distant hills, as well as in parts of the valleys, there is a\r\ngood deal of woodland.  The general tint of the landscape is not a\r\nbright green; and it resembles the country a short distance to the\r\nsouth of Concepcion in Chile. In several parts of the bay, little\r\nvillages of square tidy looking houses are scattered close down to the\r\nwater's edge. Three whaling-ships were lying at anchor, and a canoe\r\nevery now and then crossed from shore to shore; with these exceptions,\r\nan air of extreme quietness reigned over the whole district.  Only a\r\nsingle canoe came alongside.  This, and the aspect of the whole scene,\r\nafforded a remarkable, and not very pleasing contrast, with our joyful\r\nand boisterous welcome at Tahiti.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we went on shore to one of the larger groups of\r\nhouses, which yet hardly deserves the title of a village.  Its name is\r\nPahia: it is the residence of the missionaries; and there are no native\r\nresidents except servants and labourers.  In the vicinity of the Bay of\r\nIslands, the number of Englishmen, including their families, amounts to\r\nbetween two and three hundred.  All the cottages, many of which are\r\nwhitewashed and look very neat, are the property of the English.  The\r\nhovels of the natives are so diminutive and paltry, that they can\r\nscarcely be perceived from a distance. At Pahia, it was quite pleasing\r\nto behold the English flowers in the gardens before the houses; there\r\nwere roses of several kinds, honeysuckle, jasmine, stocks, and whole\r\nhedges of sweetbrier.\r\n\r\nDecember 22nd.--In the morning I went out walking; but I soon found\r\nthat the country was very impracticable.  All the hills are thickly\r\ncovered with tall fern, together with a low bush which grows like a\r\ncypress; and very little ground has been cleared or cultivated.  I then\r\ntried the sea-beach; but proceeding towards either hand, my walk was\r\nsoon stopped by salt-water creeks and deep brooks.  The communication\r\nbetween the inhabitants of the different parts of the bay, is (as in\r\nChiloe) almost entirely kept up by boats.  I was surprised to find that\r\nalmost every hill which I ascended, had been at some former time more\r\nor less fortified.  The summits were cut into steps or successive\r\nterraces, and frequently they had been protected by deep trenches.  I\r\nafterwards observed that the principal hills inland in like manner\r\nshowed an artificial outline.  These are the Pas, so frequently\r\nmentioned by Captain Cook under the name of \"hippah;\" the difference of\r\nsound being owing to the prefixed article.\r\n\r\nThat the Pas had formerly been much used, was evident from the piles of\r\nshells, and the pits in which, as I was informed, sweet potatoes used\r\nto be kept as a reserve.  As there was no water on these hills, the\r\ndefenders could never have anticipated a long siege, but only a hurried\r\nattack for plunder, against which the successive terraces would have\r\nafforded good protection.  The general introduction of fire-arms has\r\nchanged the whole system of warfare; and an exposed situation on the\r\ntop of a hill is now worse than useless. The Pas in consequence are, at\r\nthe present day, always built on a level piece of ground.  They consist\r\nof a double stockade of thick and tall posts, placed in a zigzag line,\r\nso that every part can be flanked.  Within the stockade a mound of\r\nearth is thrown up, behind which the defenders can rest in safety, or\r\nuse their fire-arms over it.  On the level of the ground little\r\narchways sometimes pass through this breastwork, by which means the\r\ndefenders can crawl out to the stockade and reconnoitre their enemies.\r\nThe Rev. W. Williams, who gave me this account, added, that in one Pas\r\nhe had noticed spurs or buttresses projecting on the inner and\r\nprotected side of the mound of earth.  On asking the chief the use of\r\nthem, he replied, that if two or three of his men were shot, their\r\nneighbours would not see the bodies, and so be discouraged.\r\n\r\nThese Pas are considered by the New Zealanders as very perfect means of\r\ndefence: for the attacking force is never so well disciplined as to\r\nrush in a body to the stockade, cut it down, and effect their entry.\r\nWhen a tribe goes to war, the chief cannot order one party to go here\r\nand another there; but every man fights in the manner which best\r\npleases himself; and to each separate individual to approach a stockade\r\ndefended by fire-arms must appear certain death.  I should think a more\r\nwarlike race of inhabitants could not be found in any part of the world\r\nthan the New Zealanders. Their conduct on first seeing a ship, as\r\ndescribed by Captain Cook, strongly illustrates this: the act of\r\nthrowing volleys of stones at so great and novel an object, and their\r\ndefiance of \"Come on shore and we will kill and eat you all,\" shows\r\nuncommon boldness.  This warlike spirit is evident in many of their\r\ncustoms, and even in their smallest actions.  If a New Zealander is\r\nstruck, although but in joke, the blow must be returned and of this I\r\nsaw an instance with one of our officers.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, from the progress of civilization, there is much\r\nless warfare, except among some of the southern tribes.  I heard a\r\ncharacteristic anecdote of what took place some time ago in the south.\r\nA missionary found a chief and his tribe in preparation for war;--their\r\nmuskets clean and bright, and their ammunition ready.  He reasoned long\r\non the inutility of the war, and the little provocation which had been\r\ngiven for it.  The chief was much shaken in his resolution, and seemed\r\nin doubt: but at length it occurred to him that a barrel of his\r\ngunpowder was in a bad state, and that it would not keep much longer.\r\nThis was brought forward as an unanswerable argument for the necessity\r\nof immediately declaring war: the idea of allowing so much good\r\ngunpowder to spoil was not to be thought of; and this settled the\r\npoint.  I was told by the missionaries that in the life of Shongi, the\r\nchief who visited England, the love of war was the one and lasting\r\nspring of every action.  The tribe in which he was a principal chief\r\nhad at one time been oppressed by another tribe from the Thames River.\r\nA solemn oath was taken by the men that when their boys should grow up,\r\nand they should be powerful enough, they would never forget or forgive\r\nthese injuries.  To fulfil this oath appears to have been Shongi's\r\nchief motive for going to England; and when there it was his sole\r\nobject.  Presents were valued only as they could be converted into\r\narms; of the arts, those alone interested him which were connected with\r\nthe manufacture of arms.  When at Sydney, Shongi, by a strange\r\ncoincidence, met the hostile chief of the Thames River at the house of\r\nMr. Marsden: their conduct was civil to each other; but Shongi told him\r\nthat when again in New Zealand he would never cease to carry war into\r\nhis country. The challenge was accepted; and Shongi on his return\r\nfulfilled the threat to the utmost letter.  The tribe on the Thames\r\nRiver was utterly overthrown, and the chief to whom the challenge had\r\nbeen given was himself killed. Shongi, although harbouring such deep\r\nfeelings of hatred and revenge, is described as having been a\r\ngood-natured person.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went with Captain Fitz Roy and Mr. Baker, one of the\r\nmissionaries, to pay a visit to Kororadika: we wandered about the\r\nvillage, and saw and conversed with many of the people, both men,\r\nwomen, and children.  Looking at the New Zealander, one naturally\r\ncompares him with the Tahitian; both belonging to the same family of\r\nmankind. The comparison, however, tells heavily against the New\r\nZealander.  He may, perhaps be superior in energy, but in every other\r\nrespect his character is of a much lower order.  One glance at their\r\nrespective expressions, brings conviction to the mind that one is a\r\nsavage, the other a civilized man.  It would be vain to seek in the\r\nwhole of New Zealand a person with the face and mien of the old\r\nTahitian chief Utamme.  No doubt the extraordinary manner in which\r\ntattooing is here practised, gives a disagreeable expression to their\r\ncountenances.  The complicated but symmetrical figures covering the\r\nwhole face, puzzle and mislead an unaccustomed eye: it is moreover\r\nprobable, that the deep incisions, by destroying the play of the\r\nsuperficial muscles, give an air of rigid inflexibility.  But, besides\r\nthis, there is a twinkling in the eye, which cannot indicate anything\r\nbut cunning and ferocity.  Their figures are tall and bulky; but not\r\ncomparable in elegance with those of the working-classes in Tahiti.\r\n\r\nBut their persons and houses are filthily dirty and offensive: the idea\r\nof washing either their bodies or their clothes never seems to enter\r\ntheir heads.  I saw a chief, who was wearing a shirt black and matted\r\nwith filth, and when asked how it came to be so dirty, he replied, with\r\nsurprise, \"Do not you see it is an old one?\" Some of the men have\r\nshirts; but the common dress is one or two large blankets, generally\r\nblack with dirt, which are thrown over their shoulders in a very\r\ninconvenient and awkward fashion.  A few of the principal chiefs have\r\ndecent suits of English clothes; but these are only worn on great\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nDecember 23rd.--At a place called Waimate, about fifteen miles from the\r\nBay of Islands, and midway between the eastern and western coasts, the\r\nmissionaries have purchased some land for agricultural purposes.  I had\r\nbeen introduced to the Rev. W. Williams, who, upon my expressing a\r\nwish, invited me to pay him a visit there.  Mr. Bushby, the British\r\nresident, offered to take me in his boat by a creek, where I should see\r\na pretty waterfall, and by which means my walk would be shortened.  He\r\nlikewise procured for me a guide.\r\n\r\nUpon asking a neighbouring chief to recommend a man, the chief himself\r\noffered to go; but his ignorance of the value of money was so complete,\r\nthat at first he asked how many pounds I would give him, but afterwards\r\nwas well contented with two dollars.  When I showed the chief a very\r\nsmall bundle, which I wanted carried, it became absolutely necessary\r\nfor him to take a slave.  These feelings of pride are beginning to wear\r\naway; but formerly a leading man would sooner have died, than undergone\r\nthe indignity of carrying the smallest burden.  My companion was a\r\nlight active man, dressed in a dirty blanket, and with his face\r\ncompletely tattooed.  He had formerly been a great warrior.  He\r\nappeared to be on very cordial terms with Mr. Bushby; but at various\r\ntimes they had quarrelled violently.  Mr. Bushby remarked that a little\r\nquiet irony would frequently silence any one of these natives in their\r\nmost blustering moments. This chief has come and harangued Mr. Bushby\r\nin a hectoring manner, saying, \"great chief, a great man, a friend of\r\nmine, has come to pay me a visit--you must give him something good to\r\neat, some fine presents, etc.\" Mr. Bushby has allowed him to finish his\r\ndiscourse, and then has quietly replied by some answer such as, \"What\r\nelse shall your slave do for you?\" The man would then instantly, with a\r\nvery comical expression, cease his braggadocio.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, Mr. Bushby suffered a far more serious attack.  A chief\r\nand a party of men tried to break into his house in the middle of the\r\nnight, and not finding this so easy, commenced a brisk firing with\r\ntheir muskets.  Mr. Bushby was slightly wounded, but the party was at\r\nlength driven away.  Shortly afterwards it was discovered who was the\r\naggressor; and a general meeting of the chiefs was convened to consider\r\nthe case.  It was considered by the New Zealanders as very atrocious,\r\ninasmuch as it was a night attack, and that Mrs. Bushby was lying ill\r\nin the house: this latter circumstance, much to their honour, being\r\nconsidered in all cases as a protection.  The chiefs agreed to\r\nconfiscate the land of the aggressor to the King of England.  The whole\r\nproceeding, however, in thus trying and punishing a chief was entirely\r\nwithout precedent.  The aggressor, moreover, lost caste in the\r\nestimation of his equals and this was considered by the British as of\r\nmore consequence than the confiscation of his land.\r\n\r\nAs the boat was shoving off, a second chief stepped into her, who only\r\nwanted the amusement of the passage up and down the creek.  I never saw\r\na more horrid and ferocious expression than this man had.  It\r\nimmediately struck me I had somewhere seen his likeness: it will be\r\nfound in Retzch's outlines to Schiller's ballad of Fridolin, where two\r\nmen are pushing Robert into the burning iron furnace.  It is the man\r\nwho has his arm on Robert's breast.  Physiognomy here spoke the truth;\r\nthis chief had been a notorious murderer, and was an arrant coward to\r\nboot.  At the point where the boat landed, Mr. Bushby accompanied me a\r\nfew hundred yards on the road: I could not help admiring the cool\r\nimpudence of the hoary old villain, whom we left lying in the boat,\r\nwhen he shouted to Mr. Bushby, \"Do not you stay long, I shall be tired\r\nof waiting here.\"\r\n\r\nWe now commenced our walk.  The road lay along a well beaten path,\r\nbordered on each side by the tall fern, which covers the whole country.\r\nAfter travelling some miles, we came to a little country village, where\r\na few hovels were collected together, and some patches of ground\r\ncultivated with potatoes.  The introduction of the potato has been the\r\nmost essential benefit to the island; it is now much more used than any\r\nnative vegetable.  New Zealand is favoured by one great natural\r\nadvantage; namely, that the inhabitants can never perish from famine.\r\nThe whole country abounds with fern: and the roots of this plant, if\r\nnot very palatable, yet contain much nutriment.  A native can always\r\nsubsist on these, and on the shell-fish, which are abundant on all\r\nparts of the sea-coast.  The villages are chiefly conspicuous by the\r\nplatforms which are raised on four posts ten or twelve feet above the\r\nground, and on which the produce of the fields is kept secure from all\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nOn coming near one of the huts I was much amused by seeing in due form\r\nthe ceremony of rubbing, or, as it ought to be called, pressing noses.\r\nThe women, on our first approach, began uttering something in a most\r\ndolorous voice; they then squatted themselves down and held up their\r\nfaces; my companion standing over them, one after another, placed the\r\nbridge of his nose at right angles to theirs, and commenced pressing.\r\nThis lasted rather longer than a cordial shake of the hand with us, and\r\nas we vary the force of the grasp of the hand in shaking, so do they in\r\npressing.  During the process they uttered comfortable little grunts,\r\nvery much in the same manner as two pigs do, when rubbing against each\r\nother.  I noticed that the slave would press noses with any one he met,\r\nindifferently either before or after his master the chief.  Although\r\namong the savages, the chief has absolute power of life and death over\r\nhis slave, yet there is an entire absence of ceremony between them. Mr.\r\nBurchell has remarked the same thing in Southern Africa, with the rude\r\nBachapins.  Where civilization has arrived at a certain point, complex\r\nformalities soon arise between the different grades of society: thus at\r\nTahiti all were formerly obliged to uncover themselves as low as the\r\nwaist in presence of the king.\r\n\r\nThe ceremony of pressing noses having been duly completed with all\r\npresent, we seated ourselves in a circle in the front of one of the\r\nhovels, and rested there half-an-hour. All the hovels have nearly the\r\nsame form and dimensions, and all agree in being filthily dirty.  They\r\nresemble a cow-shed with one end open, but having a partition a little\r\nway within, with a square hole in it, making a small gloomy chamber. In\r\nthis the inhabitants keep all their property, and when the weather is\r\ncold they sleep there.  They eat, however, and pass their time in the\r\nopen part in front.  My guides having finished their pipes, we\r\ncontinued our walk. The path led through the same undulating country,\r\nthe whole uniformly clothed as before with fern.  On our right hand we\r\nhad a serpentine river, the banks of which were fringed with trees, and\r\nhere and there on the hill sides there was a clump of wood.  The whole\r\nscene, in spite of its green colour, had rather a desolate aspect.  The\r\nsight of so much fern impresses the mind with an idea of sterility:\r\nthis, however, is not correct; for wherever the fern grows thick and\r\nbreast-high, the land by tillage becomes productive.  Some of the\r\nresidents think that all this extensive open country originally was\r\ncovered with forests, and that it has been cleared by fire. It is said,\r\nthat by digging in the barest spots, lumps of the kind of resin which\r\nflows from the kauri pine are frequently found.  The natives had an\r\nevident motive in clearing the country; for the fern, formerly a staple\r\narticle of food, flourishes only in the open cleared tracks.  The\r\nalmost entire absence of associated grasses, which forms so remarkable\r\na feature in the vegetation of this island, may perhaps be accounted\r\nfor by the land having been aboriginally covered with forest-trees.\r\n\r\nThe soil is volcanic; in several parts we passed over shaggy lavas, and\r\ncraters could clearly be distinguished on several of the neighbouring\r\nhills.  Although the scenery is nowhere beautiful, and only\r\noccasionally pretty, I enjoyed my walk.  I should have enjoyed it more,\r\nif my companion, the chief, had not possessed extraordinary\r\nconversational powers.  I knew only three words: \"good,\" \"bad,\" and\r\n\"yes:\" and with these I answered all his remarks, without of course\r\nhaving understood one word he said.  This, however, was quite\r\nsufficient: I was a good listener, an agreeable person, and he never\r\nceased talking to me.\r\n\r\nAt length we reached Waimate.  After having passed over so many miles\r\nof an uninhabited useless country, the sudden appearance of an English\r\nfarm-house, and its well-dressed fields, placed there as if by an\r\nenchanter's wand, was exceedingly pleasant.  Mr. Williams not being at\r\nhome, I received in Mr. Davies's house a cordial welcome.  After\r\ndrinking tea with his family party, we took a stroll about the farm. At\r\nWaimate there are three large houses, where the missionary gentlemen,\r\nMessrs. Williams, Davies, and Clarke, reside; and near them are the\r\nhuts of the native labourers.  On an adjoining slope, fine crops of\r\nbarley and wheat were standing in full ear; and in another part, fields\r\nof potatoes and clover. But I cannot attempt to describe all I saw;\r\nthere were large gardens, with every fruit and vegetable which England\r\nproduces; and many belonging to a warmer clime.  I may instance\r\nasparagus, kidney beans, cucumbers, rhubarb, apples, pears, figs,\r\npeaches, apricots, grapes, olives, gooseberries, currants, hops, gorse\r\nfor fences, and English oaks; also many kinds of flowers.  Around the\r\nfarm-yard there were stables, a thrashing-barn with its winnowing\r\nmachine, a blacksmith's forge, and on the ground ploughshares and other\r\ntools: in the middle was that happy mixture of pigs and poultry, lying\r\ncomfortably together, as in every English farm-yard.  At the distance\r\nof a few hundred yards, where the water of a little rill had been\r\ndammed up into a pool, there was a large and substantial water-mill.\r\n\r\nAll this is very surprising, when it is considered that five years ago\r\nnothing but the fern flourished here.  Moreover, native workmanship,\r\ntaught by the missionaries, has effected this change;--the lesson of\r\nthe missionary is the enchanter's wand.  The house had been built, the\r\nwindows framed, the fields ploughed, and even the trees grafted, by a\r\nNew Zealander. At the mill, a New Zealander was seen powdered white\r\nwith flower, like his brother miller in England.  When I looked at this\r\nwhole scene, I thought it admirable.  It was not merely that England\r\nwas brought vividly before my mind; yet, as the evening drew to a\r\nclose, the domestic sounds, the fields of corn, the distant undulating\r\ncountry with its trees might well have been mistaken for our\r\nfatherland: nor was it the triumphant feeling at seeing what Englishmen\r\ncould effect; but rather the high hopes thus inspired for the future\r\nprogress of this fine island.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral young men, redeemed by the missionaries from slavery, were\r\nemployed on the farm.  They were dressed in a shirt, jacket, and\r\ntrousers, and had a respectable appearance. Judging from one trifling\r\nanecdote, I should think they must be honest.  When walking in the\r\nfields, a young labourer came up to Mr. Davies, and gave him a knife\r\nand gimlet, saying that he had found them on the road, and did not know\r\nto whom they belonged!  These young men and boys appeared very merry\r\nand good-humoured.  In the evening I saw a party of them at cricket:\r\nwhen I thought of the austerity of which the missionaries have been\r\naccused, I was amused by observing one of their own sons taking an\r\nactive part in the game.  A more decided and pleasing change was\r\nmanifested in the young women, who acted as servants within the houses.\r\nTheir clean, tidy, and healthy appearance, like that of the dairy-maids\r\nin England, formed a wonderful contrast with the women of the filthy\r\nhovels in Kororadika. The wives of the missionaries tried to persuade\r\nthem not to be tattooed; but a famous operator having arrived from the\r\nsouth, they said, \"We really must just have a few lines on our lips;\r\nelse when we grow old, our lips will shrivel, and we shall be so very\r\nugly.\" There is not nearly so much tattooing as formerly; but as it is\r\na badge of distinction between the chief and the slave, it will\r\nprobably long be practised.  So soon does any train of ideas become\r\nhabitual, that the missionaries told me that even in their eyes a plain\r\nface looked mean, and not like that of a New Zealand gentleman.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening I went to Mr. Williams's house, where I passed the\r\nnight.  I found there a large party of children, collected together for\r\nChristmas Day, and all sitting round a table at tea.  I never saw a\r\nnicer or more merry group; and to think that this was in the centre of\r\nthe land of cannibalism, murder, and all atrocious crimes!  The\r\ncordiality and happiness so plainly pictured in the faces of the little\r\ncircle, appeared equally felt by the older persons of the mission.\r\n\r\nDecember 24th.--In the morning, prayers were read in the native tongue\r\nto the whole family.  After breakfast I rambled about the gardens and\r\nfarm.  This was a market-day, when the natives of the surrounding\r\nhamlets bring their potatoes, Indian corn, or pigs, to exchange for\r\nblankets, tobacco, and sometimes, through the persuasions of the\r\nmissionaries, for soap.  Mr. Davies's eldest son, who manages a farm of\r\nhis own, is the man of business in the market.  The children of the\r\nmissionaries, who came while young to the island, understand the\r\nlanguage better than their parents, and can get anything more readily\r\ndone by the natives.\r\n\r\nA little before noon Messrs. Williams and Davies walked with me to a\r\npart of a neighbouring forest, to show me the famous kauri pine.  I\r\nmeasured one of the noble trees, and found it thirty-one feet in\r\ncircumference above the roots. There was another close by, which I did\r\nnot see, thirty-three feet; and I heard of one no less than forty feet.\r\nThese trees are remarkable for their smooth cylindrical boles, which\r\nrun up to a height of sixty, and even ninety feet, with a nearly equal\r\ndiameter, and without a single branch.  The crown of branches at the\r\nsummit is out of all proportion small to the trunk; and the leaves are\r\nlikewise small compared with the branches.  The forest was here almost\r\ncomposed of the kauri; and the largest trees, from the parallelism of\r\ntheir sides, stood up like gigantic columns of wood.  The timber of the\r\nkauri is the most valuable production of the island; moreover, a\r\nquantity of resin oozes from the bark, which is sold at a penny a pound\r\nto the Americans, but its use was then unknown.  Some of the New\r\nZealand forest must be impenetrable to an extraordinary degree.  Mr.\r\nMatthews informed me that one forest only thirty-four miles in width,\r\nand separating two inhabited districts, had only lately, for the first\r\ntime, been crossed.  He and another missionary, each with a party of\r\nabout fifty men, undertook to open a road, but it cost more than a\r\nfortnight's labour!  In the woods I saw very few birds.  With regard to\r\nanimals, it is a most remarkable fact, that so large an island,\r\nextending over more than 700 miles in latitude, and in many parts\r\nninety broad, with varied stations, a fine climate, and land of all\r\nheights, from 14,000 feet downwards, with the exception of a small rat,\r\ndid not possess one indigenous animal. The several species of that\r\ngigantic genus of birds, the Deinornis seem here to have replaced\r\nmammiferous quadrupeds, in the same manner as the reptiles still do at\r\nthe Galapagos archipelago.  It is said that the common Norway rat, in\r\nthe short space of two years, annihilated in this northern end of the\r\nisland, the New Zealand species.  In many places I noticed several\r\nsorts of weeds, which, like the rats, I was forced to own as\r\ncountrymen.  A leek has overrun whole districts, and will prove very\r\ntroublesome, but it was imported as a favour by a French vessel.  The\r\ncommon dock is also widely disseminated, and will, I fear, for ever\r\nremain a proof of the rascality of an Englishman, who sold the seeds\r\nfor those of the tobacco plant.\r\n\r\nOn returning from our pleasant walk to the house, I dined with Mr.\r\nWilliams; and then, a horse being lent me, I returned to the Bay of\r\nIslands.  I took leave of the missionaries with thankfulness for their\r\nkind welcome, and with feelings of high respect for their\r\ngentlemanlike, useful, and upright characters.  I think it would be\r\ndifficult to find a body of men better adapted for the high office\r\nwhich they fulfil.\r\n\r\nChristmas Day.--In a few more days the fourth year of our absence from\r\nEngland will be completed.  Our first Christmas Day was spent at\r\nPlymouth, the second at St. Martin's Cove, near Cape Horn; the third at\r\nPort Desire, in Patagonia; the fourth at anchor in a wild harbour in\r\nthe peninsula of Tres Montes, this fifth here, and the next, I trust in\r\nProvidence, will be in England.  We attended divine service in the\r\nchapel of Pahia; part of the service being read in English, and part in\r\nthe native language.  Whilst at New Zealand we did not hear of any\r\nrecent acts of cannibalism; but Mr. Stokes found burnt human bones\r\nstrewed round a fire-place on a small island near the anchorage; but\r\nthese remains of a comfortable banquet might have been lying there for\r\nseveral years.  It is probable that the moral state of the people will\r\nrapidly improve.  Mr. Bushby mentioned one pleasing anecdote as a proof\r\nof the sincerity of some, at least, of those who profess Christianity.\r\nOne of his young men left him, who had been accustomed to read prayers\r\nto the rest of the servants.  Some weeks afterwards, happening to pass\r\nlate in the evening by an outhouse, he saw and heard one of his men\r\nreading the Bible with difficulty by the light of the fire, to the\r\nothers.  After this the party knelt and prayed: in their prayers they\r\nmentioned Mr. Bushby and his family, and the missionaries, each\r\nseparately in his respective district.\r\n\r\nDecember 26th.--Mr. Bushby offered to take Mr. Sulivan and myself in\r\nhis boat some miles up the river to Cawa-Cawa, and proposed afterwards\r\nto walk on to the village of Waiomio, where there are some curious\r\nrocks.  Following one of the arms of the bay, we enjoyed a pleasant\r\nrow, and passed through pretty scenery, until we came to a village,\r\nbeyond which the boat could not pass.  From this place a chief and a\r\nparty of men volunteered to walk with us to Waiomio, a distance of four\r\nmiles.  The chief was at this time rather notorious from having lately\r\nhung one of his wives and a slave for adultery.  When one of the\r\nmissionaries remonstrated with him he seemed surprised, and said he\r\nthought he was exactly following the English method. Old Shongi, who\r\nhappened to be in England during the Queen's trial, expressed great\r\ndisapprobation at the whole proceeding: he said he had five wives, and\r\nhe would rather cut off all their heads than be so much troubled about\r\none. Leaving this village, we crossed over to another, seated on a\r\nhill-side at a little distance.  The daughter of a chief, who was still\r\na heathen, had died there five days before.  The hovel in which she had\r\nexpired had been burnt to the ground: her body being enclosed between\r\ntwo small canoes, was placed upright on the ground, and protected by an\r\nenclosure bearing wooden images of their gods, and the whole was\r\npainted bright red, so as to be conspicuous from afar.  Her gown was\r\nfastened to the coffin, and her hair being cut off was cast at its\r\nfoot.  The relatives of the family had torn the flesh of their arms,\r\nbodies, and faces, so that they were covered with clotted blood; and\r\nthe old women looked most filthy, disgusting objects.  On the following\r\nday some of the officers visited this place, and found the women still\r\nhowling and cutting themselves.\r\n\r\nWe continued our walk, and soon reached Waiomio.  Here there are some\r\nsingular masses of limestone, resembling ruined castles.  These rocks\r\nhave long served for burial places, and in consequence are held too\r\nsacred to be approached. One of the young men, however, cried out, \"Let\r\nus all be brave,\" and ran on ahead; but when within a hundred yards,\r\nthe whole party thought better of it, and stopped short.  With perfect\r\nindifference, however, they allowed us to examine the whole place.  At\r\nthis village we rested some hours, during which time there was a long\r\ndiscussion with Mr. Bushby, concerning the right of sale of certain\r\nlands. One old man, who appeared a perfect genealogist, illustrated the\r\nsuccessive possessors by bits of stick driven into the ground.  Before\r\nleaving the houses a little basketful of roasted sweet potatoes was\r\ngiven to each of our party; and we all, according to the custom,\r\ncarried them away to eat on the road.  I noticed that among the women\r\nemployed in cooking, there was a man-slave: it must be a humiliating\r\nthing for a man in this warlike country to be employed in doing that\r\nwhich is considered as the lowest woman's work. Slaves are not allowed\r\nto go to war; but this perhaps can hardly be considered as a hardship.\r\nI heard of one poor wretch who, during hostilities, ran away to the\r\nopposite party; being met by two men, he was immediately seized; but as\r\nthey could not agree to whom he should belong, each stood over him with\r\na stone hatchet, and seemed determined that the other at least should\r\nnot take him away alive.  The poor man, almost dead with fright, was\r\nonly saved by the address of a chief's wife.  We afterwards enjoyed a\r\npleasant walk back to the boat, but did not reach the ship till late in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nDecember 30th.--In the afternoon we stood out of the Bay of Islands, on\r\nour course to Sydney.  I believe we were all glad to leave New Zealand.\r\nIt is not a pleasant place. Amongst the natives there is absent that\r\ncharming simplicity which is found in Tahiti; and the greater part of\r\nthe English are the very refuse of society.  Neither is the country\r\nitself attractive.  I look back but to one bright spot, and that is\r\nWaimate, with its Christian inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nSydney--Excursion to Bathurst--Aspect of the Woods--Party of\r\nNatives--Gradual Extinction of the Aborigines--Infection generated by\r\nassociated Men in health--Blue Mountains--View of the grand gulf-like\r\nValleys--Their origin and formation--Bathurst, general civility of the\r\nLower Orders--State of Society--Van Diemen's Land--Hobart\r\nTown--Aborigines all banished--Mount Wellington--King George's\r\nSound--Cheerless Aspect of the Country--Bald Head, calcareous casts of\r\nbranches of Trees--Party of Natives--Leave Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY 12th, 1836.--Early in the morning a light air carried us\r\ntowards the entrance of Port Jackson.  Instead of beholding a verdant\r\ncountry, interspersed with fine houses, a straight line of yellowish\r\ncliff brought to our minds the coast of Patagonia.  A solitary\r\nlighthouse, built of white stone, alone told us that we were near a\r\ngreat and populous city.  Having entered the harbour, it appears fine\r\nand spacious, with cliff-formed shores of horizontally stratified\r\nsandstone.  The nearly level country is covered with thin scrubby\r\ntrees, bespeaking the curse of sterility. Proceeding further inland,\r\nthe country improves: beautiful villas and nice cottages are here and\r\nthere scattered along the beach.  In the distance stone houses, two and\r\nthree stories high, and windmills standing on the edge of a bank,\r\npointed out to us the neighbourhood of the capital of Australia.\r\n\r\nAt last we anchored within Sydney Cove.  We found the little basin\r\noccupied by many large ships, and surrounded by warehouses.  In the\r\nevening I walked through the town, and returned full of admiration at\r\nthe whole scene.  It is a most magnificent testimony to the power of\r\nthe British nation. Here, in a less promising country, scores of years\r\nhave done many more times more than an equal number of centuries have\r\neffected in South America.  My first feeling was to congratulate myself\r\nthat I was born an Englishman.  Upon seeing more of the town\r\nafterwards, perhaps my admiration fell a little; but yet it is a fine\r\ntown.  The streets are regular, broad, clean, and kept in excellent\r\norder; the houses are of a good size, and the shops well furnished.  It\r\nmay be faithfully compared to the large suburbs which stretch out from\r\nLondon and a few other great towns in England; but not even near London\r\nor Birmingham is there an appearance of such rapid growth.  The number\r\nof large houses and other buildings just finished was truly surprising;\r\nnevertheless, every one complained of the high rents and difficulty in\r\nprocuring a house.  Coming from South America, where in the towns every\r\nman of property is known, no one thing surprised me more than not being\r\nable to ascertain at once to whom this or that carriage belonged.\r\n\r\nI hired a man and two horses to take me to Bathurst, a village about\r\none hundred and twenty miles in the interior, and the centre of a great\r\npastoral district.  By this means I hoped to gain a general idea of the\r\nappearance of the country. On the morning of the 16th (January) I set\r\nout on my excursion. The first stage took us to Paramatta, a small\r\ncountry town, next to Sydney in importance.  The roads were excellent,\r\nand made upon the MacAdam principle, whinstone having been brought for\r\nthe purpose from the distance of several miles.  In all respects there\r\nwas a close resemblance to England: perhaps the alehouses here were\r\nmore numerous.  The iron gangs, or parties of convicts who have\r\ncommitted here some offense, appeared the least like England: they were\r\nworking in chains, under the charge of sentries with loaded arms.\r\n\r\nThe power which the government possesses, by means of forced labour, of\r\nat once opening good roads throughout the country, has been, I believe,\r\none main cause of the early prosperity of this colony.  I slept at\r\nnight at a very comfortable inn at Emu ferry, thirty-five miles from\r\nSydney, and near the ascent of the Blue Mountains.  This line of road\r\nis the most frequented, and has been the longest inhabited of any in\r\nthe colony.  The whole land is enclosed with high railings, for the\r\nfarmers have not succeeded in rearing hedges.  There are many\r\nsubstantial houses and good cottages scattered about; but although\r\nconsiderable pieces of land are under cultivation, the greater part yet\r\nremains as when first discovered.\r\n\r\nThe extreme uniformity of the vegetation is the most remarkable feature\r\nin the landscape of the greater part of New South Wales.  Everywhere we\r\nhave an open woodland, the ground being partially covered with a very\r\nthin pasture, with little appearance of verdure.  The trees nearly all\r\nbelong to one family, and mostly have their leaves placed in a\r\nvertical, instead of as in Europe, in a nearly horizontal position: the\r\nfoliage is scanty, and of a peculiar pale green tint, without any\r\ngloss.  Hence the woods appear light and shadowless: this, although a\r\nloss of comfort to the traveller under the scorching rays of summer, is\r\nof importance to the farmer, as it allows grass to grow where it\r\notherwise would not.  The leaves are not shed periodically: this\r\ncharacter appears common to the entire southern hemisphere, namely,\r\nSouth America, Australia, and the Cape of Good Hope.  The inhabitants\r\nof this hemisphere, and of the intertropical regions, thus lose perhaps\r\none of the most glorious, though to our eyes common, spectacles in the\r\nworld--the first bursting into full foliage of the leafless tree. They\r\nmay, however, say that we pay dearly for this by having the land\r\ncovered with mere naked skeletons for so many months.  This is too true\r\nbut our senses thus acquire a keen relish for the exquisite green of\r\nthe spring, which the eyes of those living within the tropics, sated\r\nduring the long year with the gorgeous productions of those glowing\r\nclimates, can never experience. The greater number of the trees, with\r\nthe exception of some of the Blue-gums, do not attain a large size; but\r\nthey grow tall and tolerably straight, and stand well apart.  The bark\r\nof some of the Eucalypti falls annually, or hangs dead in long shreds\r\nwhich swing about with the wind, and give to the woods a desolate and\r\nuntidy appearance.  I cannot imagine a more complete contrast, in every\r\nrespect, than between the forests of Valdivia or Chiloe, and the woods\r\nof Australia.\r\n\r\nAt sunset, a party of a score of the black aborigines passed by, each\r\ncarrying, in their accustomed manner, a bundle of spears and other\r\nweapons.  By giving a leading young man a shilling, they were easily\r\ndetained, and threw their spears for my amusement.  They were all\r\npartly clothed, and several could speak a little English: their\r\ncountenances were good-humoured and pleasant, and they appeared far\r\nfrom being such utterly degraded beings as they have usually been\r\nrepresented.  In their own arts they are admirable.  A cap being fixed\r\nat thirty yards distance, they transfixed it with a spear, delivered by\r\nthe throwing-stick with the rapidity of an arrow from the bow of a\r\npractised archer.  In tracking animals or men they show most wonderful\r\nsagacity; and I heard of several of their remarks which manifested\r\nconsiderable acuteness. They will not, however, cultivate the ground,\r\nor build houses and remain stationary, or even take the trouble of\r\ntending a flock of sheep when given to them.  On the whole they appear\r\nto me to stand some few degrees higher in the scale of civilization\r\nthan the Fuegians.\r\n\r\nIt is very curious thus to see in the midst of a civilized people, a\r\nset of harmless savages wandering about without knowing where they\r\nshall sleep at night, and gaining their livelihood by hunting in the\r\nwoods.  As the white man has travelled onwards, he has spread over the\r\ncountry belonging to several tribes.  These, although thus enclosed by\r\none common people, keep up their ancient distinctions, and sometimes go\r\nto war with each other.  In an engagement which took place lately, the\r\ntwo parties most singularly chose the centre of the village of Bathurst\r\nfor the field of battle.  This was of service to the defeated side, for\r\nthe runaway warriors took refuge in the barracks.\r\n\r\nThe number of aborigines is rapidly decreasing.  In my whole ride, with\r\nthe exception of some boys brought up by Englishmen, I saw only one\r\nother party.  This decrease, no doubt, must be partly owing to the\r\nintroduction of spirits, to European diseases (even the milder ones of\r\nwhich, such as the measles, [1] prove very destructive), and to the\r\ngradual extinction of the wild animals.  It is said that numbers of\r\ntheir children invariably perish in very early infancy from the effects\r\nof their wandering life; and as the difficulty of procuring food\r\nincreases, so must their wandering habits increase; and hence the\r\npopulation, without any apparent deaths from famine, is repressed in a\r\nmanner extremely sudden compared to what happens in civilized\r\ncountries, where the father, though in adding to his labour he may\r\ninjure himself, does not destroy his offspring.\r\n\r\nBesides the several evident causes of destruction, there appears to be\r\nsome more mysterious agency generally at work.  Wherever the European\r\nhas trod, death seems to pursue the aboriginal.  We may look to the\r\nwide extent of the Americas, Polynesia, the Cape of Good Hope, and\r\nAustralia, and we find the same result.  Nor is it the white man alone\r\nthat thus acts the destroyer; the Polynesian of Malay extraction has in\r\nparts of the East Indian archipelago, thus driven before him the\r\ndark-coloured native.  The varieties of man seem to act on each other\r\nin the same way as different species of animals--the stronger always\r\nextirpating the weaker.  It was melancholy at New Zealand to hear the\r\nfine energetic natives saying that they knew the land was doomed to\r\npass from their children.  Every one has heard of the inexplicable\r\nreduction of the population in the beautiful and healthy island of\r\nTahiti since the date of Captain Cook's voyages: although in that case\r\nwe might have expected that it would have been increased; for\r\ninfanticide, which formerly prevailed to so extraordinary a degree, has\r\nceased; profligacy has greatly diminished, and the murderous wars\r\nbecome less frequent.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Williams, in his interesting work, [2] says, that the first\r\nintercourse between natives and Europeans, \"is invariably attended with\r\nthe introduction of fever, dysentery, or some other disease, which\r\ncarries off numbers of the people.\" Again he affirms, \"It is certainly\r\na fact, which cannot be controverted, that most of the diseases which\r\nhave raged in the islands during my residence there, have been\r\nintroduced by ships; [3] and what renders this fact remarkable is, that\r\nthere might be no appearance of disease among the crew of the ship\r\nwhich conveyed this destructive importation.\" This statement is not\r\nquite so extraordinary as it at first appears; for several cases are on\r\nrecord of the most malignant fevers having broken out, although the\r\nparties themselves, who were the cause, were not affected.  In the\r\nearly part of the reign of George III., a prisoner who had been\r\nconfined in a dungeon, was taken in a coach with four constables before\r\na magistrate; and although the man himself was not ill, the four\r\nconstables died from a short putrid fever; but the contagion extended\r\nto no others.  From these facts it would almost appear as if the\r\neffluvium of one set of men shut up for some time together was\r\npoisonous when inhaled by others; and possibly more so, if the men be\r\nof different races.  Mysterious as this circumstance appears to be, it\r\nis not more surprising than that the body of one's fellow-creature,\r\ndirectly after death, and before putrefaction has commenced, should\r\noften be of so deleterious a quality, that the mere puncture from an\r\ninstrument used in its dissection, should prove fatal.\r\n\r\n17th.--Early in the morning we passed the Nepean in a ferry-boat. The\r\nriver, although at this spot both broad and deep, had a very small body\r\nof running water.  Having crossed a low piece of land on the opposite\r\nside, we reached the slope of the Blue Mountains.  The ascent is not\r\nsteep, the road having been cut with much care on the side of a\r\nsandstone cliff.  On the summit an almost level plain extends, which,\r\nrising imperceptibly to the westward, at last attains a height of more\r\nthan 3000 feet.  From so grand a title as Blue Mountains, and from\r\ntheir absolute altitude, I expected to have seen a bold chain of\r\nmountains crossing the country; but instead of this, a sloping plain\r\npresents merely an inconsiderable front to the low land near the coast.\r\nFrom this first slope, the view of the extensive woodland to the east\r\nwas striking, and the surrounding trees grew bold and lofty.  But when\r\nonce on the sandstone platform, the scenery becomes exceedingly\r\nmonotonous; each side of the road is bordered by scrubby trees of the\r\nnever-failing Eucalyptus family; and with the exception of two or three\r\nsmall inns, there are no houses or cultivated land: the road, moreover,\r\nis solitary; the most frequent object being a bullock-waggon, piled up\r\nwith bales of wool.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the day we baited our horses at a little inn, called\r\nthe Weatherboard.  The country here is elevated 2800 feet above the\r\nsea.  About a mile and a half from this place there is a view\r\nexceedingly well worth visiting.  Following down a little valley and\r\nits tiny rill of water, an immense gulf unexpectedly opens through the\r\ntrees which border the pathway, at the depth of perhaps 1500 feet.\r\nWalking on a few yards, one stands on the brink of a vast precipice,\r\nand below one sees a grand bay or gulf, for I know not what other name\r\nto give it, thickly covered with forest. The point of view is situated\r\nas if at the head of a bay, the line of cliff diverging on each side,\r\nand showing headland behind headland, as on a bold sea-coast.  These\r\ncliffs are composed of horizontal strata of whitish sandstone; and are\r\nso absolutely vertical, that in many places a person standing on the\r\nedge and throwing down a stone, can see it strike the trees in the\r\nabyss below.  So unbroken is the line of cliff, that in order to reach\r\nthe foot of the waterfall, formed by this little stream, it is said to\r\nbe necessary to go sixteen miles round.  About five miles distant in\r\nfront, another line of cliff extends, which thus appears completely to\r\nencircle the valley; and hence the name of bay is justified, as applied\r\nto this grand amphitheatrical depression.  If we imagine a winding\r\nharbour, with its deep water surrounded by bold cliff-like shores, to\r\nbe laid dry, and a forest to spring up on its sandy bottom, we should\r\nthen have the appearance and structure here exhibited.  This kind of\r\nview was to me quite novel, and extremely magnificent.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we reached the Blackheath.  The sandstone plateau has\r\nhere attained the height of 3400 feet; and is covered, as before, with\r\nthe same scrubby woods.  From the road, there were occasional glimpses\r\ninto a profound valley, of the same character as the one described; but\r\nfrom the steepness and depth of its sides, the bottom was scarcely ever\r\nto be seen.  The Blackheath is a very comfortable inn, kept by an old\r\nsoldier; and it reminded me of the small inns in North Wales.\r\n\r\n18th.--Very early in the morning, I walked about three miles to see\r\nGovett's Leap; a view of a similar character with that near the\r\nWeatherboard, but perhaps even more stupendous.  So early in the day\r\nthe gulf was filled with a thin blue haze, which, although destroying\r\nthe general effect of the view added to the apparent depth at which the\r\nforest was stretched out beneath our feet.  These valleys, which so\r\nlong presented an insuperable barrier to the attempts of the most\r\nenterprising of the colonists to reach the interior, are most\r\nremarkable.  Great arm-like bays, expanding at their upper ends, often\r\nbranch from the main valleys and penetrate the sandstone platform; on\r\nthe other hand, the platform often sends promontories into the valleys,\r\nand even leaves in them great, almost insulated, masses.  To descend\r\ninto some of these valleys, it is necessary to go round twenty miles;\r\nand into others, the surveyors have only lately penetrated, and the\r\ncolonists have not yet been able to drive in their cattle.  But the\r\nmost remarkable feature in their structure is, that although several\r\nmiles wide at their heads, they generally contract towards their mouths\r\nto such a degree as to become impassable.  The Surveyor-General, Sir T.\r\nMitchell, [4] endeavoured in vain, first walking and then by crawling\r\nbetween the great fallen fragments of sandstone, to ascend through the\r\ngorge by which the river Grose joins the Nepean, yet the valley of the\r\nGrose in its upper part, as I saw, forms a magnificent level basin some\r\nmiles in width, and is on all sides surrounded by cliffs, the summits\r\nof which are believed to be nowhere less than 3000 feet above the level\r\nof the sea.  When cattle are driven into the valley of the Wolgan by a\r\npath (which I descended), partly natural and partly made by the owner\r\nof the land, they cannot escape; for this valley is in every other part\r\nsurrounded by perpendicular cliffs, and eight miles lower down, it\r\ncontracts from an average width of half a mile, to a mere chasm,\r\nimpassable to man or beast.  Sir T. Mitchell states that the great\r\nvalley of the Cox river with all its branches, contracts, where it\r\nunites with the Nepean, into a gorge 2200 yards in width, and about\r\n1000 feet in depth.  Other similar cases might have been added.\r\n\r\nThe first impression, on seeing the correspondence of the horizontal\r\nstrata on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatrical\r\ndepressions, is that they have been hollowed out, like other valleys,\r\nby the action of water; but when one reflects on the enormous amount of\r\nstone, which on this view must have been removed through mere gorges or\r\nchasms, one is led to ask whether these spaces may not have subsided.\r\nBut considering the form of the irregularly branching valleys, and of\r\nthe narrow promontories projecting into them from the platforms, we are\r\ncompelled to abandon this notion.  To attribute these hollows to the\r\npresent alluvial action would be preposterous; nor does the drainage\r\nfrom the summit-level always fall, as I remarked near the Weatherboard,\r\ninto the head of these valleys, but into one side of their bay-like\r\nrecesses.  Some of the inhabitants remarked to me that they never\r\nviewed one of those bay-like recesses, with the headlands receding on\r\nboth hands, without being struck with their resemblance to a bold\r\nsea-coast.  This is certainly the case; moreover, on the present coast\r\nof New South Wales, the numerous, fine, widely-branching harbours,\r\nwhich are generally connected with the sea by a narrow mouth worn\r\nthrough the sandstone coast-cliffs, varying from one mile in width to a\r\nquarter of a mile, present a likeness, though on a miniature scale, to\r\nthe great valleys of the interior.  But then immediately occurs the\r\nstartling difficulty, why has the sea worn out these great, though\r\ncircumscribed depressions on a wide platform, and left mere gorges at\r\nthe openings, through which the whole vast amount of triturated matter\r\nmust have been carried away?  The only light I can throw upon this\r\nenigma, is by remarking that banks of the most irregular forms appear\r\nto be now forming in some seas, as in parts of the West Indies and in\r\nthe Red Sea, and that their sides are exceedingly steep.  Such banks, I\r\nhave been led to suppose, have been formed by sediment heaped by strong\r\ncurrents on an irregular bottom.  That in some cases the sea, instead\r\nof spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet, heaps it round submarine\r\nrocks and islands, it is hardly possible to doubt, after examining the\r\ncharts of the West Indies; and that the waves have power to form high\r\nand precipitous cliffs, even in land-locked harbours, I have noticed in\r\nmany parts of South America.  To apply these ideas to the sandstone\r\nplatforms of New South Wales, I imagine that the strata were heaped by\r\nthe action of strong currents, and of the undulations of an open sea,\r\non an irregular bottom; and that the valley-like spaces thus left\r\nunfilled had their steeply sloping flanks worn into cliffs, during a\r\nslow elevation of the land; the worn-down sandstone being removed,\r\neither at the time when the narrow gorges were cut by the retreating\r\nsea, or subsequently by alluvial action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the Blackheath, we descended from the sandstone\r\nplatform by the pass of Mount Victoria.  To effect this pass, an\r\nenormous quantity of stone has been cut through; the design, and its\r\nmanner of execution, being worthy of any line of road in England.  We\r\nnow entered upon a country less elevated by nearly a thousand feet, and\r\nconsisting of granite.  With the change of rock, the vegetation\r\nimproved, the trees were both finer and stood farther apart; and the\r\npasture between them was a little greener and more plentiful.  At\r\nHassan's Walls, I left the high road, and made a short detour to a farm\r\ncalled Walerawang; to the superintendent of which I had a letter of\r\nintroduction from the owner in Sydney.  Mr. Browne had the kindness to\r\nask me to stay the ensuing day, which I had much pleasure in doing.\r\nThis place offers an example of one of the large farming, or rather\r\nsheep-grazing establishments of the colony.  Cattle and horses are,\r\nhowever, in this case rather more numerous than usual, owing to some of\r\nthe valleys being swampy and producing a coarser pasture.  Two or three\r\nflat pieces of ground near the house were cleared and cultivated with\r\ncorn, which the harvest-men were now reaping: but no more wheat is sown\r\nthan sufficient for the annual support of the labourers employed on the\r\nestablishment.  The usual number of assigned convict-servants here is\r\nabout forty, but at the present time there were rather more.  Although\r\nthe farm was well stocked with every necessary, there was an apparent\r\nabsence of comfort; and not one single woman resided here.  The sunset\r\nof a fine day will generally cast an air of happy contentment on any\r\nscene; but here, at this retired farm-house, the brightest tints on the\r\nsurrounding woods could not make me forget that forty hardened,\r\nprofligate men were ceasing from their daily labours, like the slaves\r\nfrom Africa, yet without their holy claim for compassion.\r\n\r\nEarly on the next morning, Mr. Archer, the joint superintendent, had\r\nthe kindness to take me out kangaroo-hunting. We continued riding the\r\ngreater part of the day, but had very bad sport, not seeing a kangaroo,\r\nor even a wild dog. The greyhounds pursued a kangaroo rat into a hollow\r\ntree, out of which we dragged it: it is an animal as large as a rabbit,\r\nbut with the figure of a kangaroo.  A few years since this country\r\nabounded with wild animals; but now the emu is banished to a long\r\ndistance, and the kangaroo is become scarce; to both the English\r\ngreyhound has been highly destructive.  It may be long before these\r\nanimals are altogether exterminated, but their doom is fixed.  The\r\naborigines are always anxious to borrow the dogs from the farm-houses:\r\nthe use of them, the offal when an animal is killed, and some milk from\r\nthe cows, are the peace-offerings of the settlers, who push farther and\r\nfarther towards the interior.  The thoughtless aboriginal, blinded by\r\nthese trifling advantages, is delighted at the approach of the white\r\nman, who seems predestined to inherit the country of his children.\r\n\r\nAlthough having poor sport, we enjoyed a pleasant ride. The woodland is\r\ngenerally so open that a person on horseback can gallop through it.  It\r\nis traversed by a few flat-bottomed valleys, which are green and free\r\nfrom trees: in such spots the scenery was pretty like that of a park.\r\nIn the whole country I scarcely saw a place without the marks of a\r\nfire; whether these had been more or less recent--whether the stumps\r\nwere more or less black, was the greatest change which varied the\r\nuniformity, so wearisome to the traveller's eye.  In these woods there\r\nare not many birds; I saw, however, some large flocks of the white\r\ncockatoo feeding in a corn-field, and a few most beautiful parrots;\r\ncrows, like our jackdaws were not uncommon, and another bird something\r\nlike the magpie.  In the dusk of the evening I took a stroll along a\r\nchain of ponds, which in this dry country represented the course of a\r\nriver, and had the good fortune to see several of the famous\r\nOrnithorhynchus paradoxus.  They were diving and playing about the\r\nsurface of the water, but showed so little of their bodies, that they\r\nmight easily have been mistaken for water-rats.  Mr. Browne shot one:\r\ncertainly it is a most extraordinary animal; a stuffed specimen does\r\nnot at all give a good idea of the appearance of the head and beak when\r\nfresh; the latter becoming hard and contracted. [5]\r\n\r\n20th.--A long day's ride to Bathurst.  Before joining the highroad we\r\nfollowed a mere path through the forest; and the country, with the\r\nexception of a few squatters' huts, was very solitary.  We experienced\r\nthis day the sirocco-like wind of Australia, which comes from the\r\nparched deserts of the interior.  Clouds of dust were travelling in\r\nevery direction; and the wind felt as if it had passed over a fire.  I\r\nafterwards heard that the thermometer out of doors had stood at 119\r\ndegs., and in a closed room at 96 degs.  In the afternoon we came in\r\nview of the downs of Bathurst.  These undulating but nearly smooth\r\nplains are very remarkable in this country, from being absolutely\r\ndestitute of trees.  They support only a thin brown pasture.  We rode\r\nsome miles over this country, and then reached the township of\r\nBathurst, seated in the middle of what may be called either a very\r\nbroad valley, or narrow plain.  I was told at Sydney not to form too\r\nbad an opinion of Australia by judging of the country from the\r\nroadside, nor too good a one from Bathurst; in this latter respect, I\r\ndid not feel myself in the least danger of being prejudiced.  The\r\nseason, it must be owned, had been one of great drought, and the\r\ncountry did not wear a favourable aspect; although I understand it was\r\nincomparably worse two or three months before.  The secret of the\r\nrapidly growing prosperity of Bathurst is, that the brown pasture which\r\nappears to the stranger's eye so wretched, is excellent for\r\nsheep-grazing.  The town stands, at the height of 2200 feet above the\r\nsea, on the banks of the Macquarie.  This is one of the rivers flowing\r\ninto the vast and scarcely known interior. The line of water-shed,\r\nwhich divides the inland streams from those on the coast, has a height\r\nof about 3000 feet, and runs in a north and south direction at the\r\ndistance of from eighty to a hundred miles from the sea-side.  The\r\nMacquarie figures in the map as a respectable river, and it is the\r\nlargest of those draining this part of the water-shed; yet to my\r\nsurprise I found it a mere chain of ponds, separated from each other by\r\nspaces almost dry.  Generally a small stream is running; and sometimes\r\nthere are high and impetuous floods.  Scanty as the supply of the water\r\nis throughout this district, it becomes still scantier further inland.\r\n\r\n22nd.--I commenced my return, and followed a new road called Lockyer's\r\nLine, along which the country is rather more hilly and picturesque.\r\nThis was a long day's ride; and the house where I wished to sleep was\r\nsome way off the road, and not easily found.  I met on this occasion,\r\nand indeed on all others, a very general and ready civility among the\r\nlower orders, which, when one considers what they are, and what they\r\nhave been, would scarcely have been expected.  The farm where I passed\r\nthe night, was owned by two young men who had only lately come out, and\r\nwere beginning a settler's life.  The total want of almost every\r\ncomfort was not attractive; but future and certain prosperity was\r\nbefore their eyes, and that not far distant.\r\n\r\nThe next day we passed through large tracts of country in flames,\r\nvolumes of smoke sweeping across the road.  Before noon we joined our\r\nformer road, and ascended Mount Victoria. I slept at the Weatherboard,\r\nand before dark took another walk to the amphitheatre.  On the road to\r\nSydney I spent a very pleasant evening with Captain King at Dunheved;\r\nand thus ended my little excursion in the colony of New South Wales.\r\n\r\nBefore arriving here the three things which interested me most\r\nwere--the state of society amongst the higher classes, the condition of\r\nthe convicts, and the degree of attraction sufficient to induce persons\r\nto emigrate.  Of course, after so very short a visit, one's opinion is\r\nworth scarcely anything; but it is as difficult not to form some\r\nopinion, as it is to form a correct judgment.  On the whole, from what\r\nI heard, more than from what I saw, I was disappointed in the state of\r\nsociety.  The whole community is rancorously divided into parties on\r\nalmost every subject.  Among those who, from their station in life,\r\nought to be the best, many live in such open profligacy that\r\nrespectable people cannot associate with them.  There is much jealousy\r\nbetween the children of the rich emancipist and the free settlers, the\r\nformer being pleased to consider honest men as interlopers. The whole\r\npopulation, poor and rich, are bent on acquiring wealth: amongst the\r\nhigher orders, wool and sheep-grazing form the constant subject of\r\nconversation.  There are many serious drawbacks to the comforts of a\r\nfamily, the chief of which, perhaps, is being surrounded by convict\r\nservants. How thoroughly odious to every feeling, to be waited on by a\r\nman who the day before, perhaps, was flogged, from your representation,\r\nfor some trifling misdemeanor.  The female servants are of course, much\r\nworse: hence children learn the vilest expressions, and it is\r\nfortunate, if not equally vile ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the capital of a person, without any trouble on his\r\npart, produces him treble interest to what it will in England; and with\r\ncare he is sure to grow rich.  The luxuries of life are in abundance,\r\nand very little dearer than in England, and most articles of food are\r\ncheaper.  The climate is splendid, and perfectly healthy; but to my\r\nmind its charms are lost by the uninviting aspect of the country.\r\nSettlers possess a great advantage in finding their sons of service\r\nwhen very young.  At the age of from sixteen to twenty, they frequently\r\ntake charge of distant farming stations. This, however, must happen at\r\nthe expense of their boys associating entirely with convict servants. I\r\nam not aware that the tone of society has assumed any peculiar\r\ncharacter; but with such habits, and without intellectual pursuits, it\r\ncan hardly fail to deteriorate.  My opinion is such, that nothing but\r\nrather sharp necessity should compel me to emigrate.\r\n\r\nThe rapid prosperity and future prospects of this colony are to me, not\r\nunderstanding these subjects, very puzzling. The two main exports are\r\nwool and whale-oil, and to both of these productions there is a limit.\r\nThe country is totally unfit for canals, therefore there is a not very\r\ndistant point, beyond which the land-carriage of wool will not repay\r\nthe expense of shearing and tending sheep.  Pasture everywhere is so\r\nthin that settlers have already pushed far into the interior: moreover,\r\nthe country further inland becomes extremely poor.  Agriculture, on\r\naccount of the droughts, can never succeed on an extended scale:\r\ntherefore, so far as I can see, Australia must ultimately depend upon\r\nbeing the centre of commerce for the southern hemisphere, and perhaps\r\non her future manufactories.  Possessing coal, she always has the\r\nmoving power at hand.  From the habitable country extending along the\r\ncoast, and from her English extraction, she is sure to be a maritime\r\nnation.  I formerly imagined that Australia would rise to be as grand\r\nand powerful a country as North America, but now it appears to me that\r\nsuch future grandeur is rather problematical.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the state of the convicts, I had still fewer\r\nopportunities of judging than on other points.  The first question is,\r\nwhether their condition is at all one of punishment: no one will\r\nmaintain that it is a very severe one. This, however, I suppose, is of\r\nlittle consequence as long as it continues to be an object of dread to\r\ncriminals at home. The corporeal wants of the convicts are tolerably\r\nwell supplied: their prospect of future liberty and comfort is not\r\ndistant, and, after good conduct, certain.  A \"ticket of leave,\" which,\r\nas long as a man keeps clear of suspicion as well as of crime, makes\r\nhim free within a certain district, is given upon good conduct, after\r\nyears proportional to the length of the sentence; yet with all this,\r\nand overlooking the previous imprisonment and wretched passage out, I\r\nbelieve the years of assignment are passed away with discontent and\r\nunhappiness.  As an intelligent man remarked to me, the convicts know\r\nno pleasure beyond sensuality, and in this they are not gratified.  The\r\nenormous bribe which Government possesses in offering free pardons,\r\ntogether with the deep horror of the secluded penal settlements,\r\ndestroys confidence between the convicts, and so prevents crime.  As to\r\na sense of shame, such a feeling does not appear to be known, and of\r\nthis I witnessed some very singular proofs.  Though it is a curious\r\nfact, I was universally told that the character of the convict\r\npopulation is one of arrant cowardice: not unfrequently some become\r\ndesperate, and quite indifferent as to life, yet a plan requiring cool\r\nor continued courage is seldom put into execution.  The worst feature\r\nin the whole case is, that although there exists what may be called a\r\nlegal reform, and comparatively little is committed which the law can\r\ntouch, yet that any moral reform should take place appears to be quite\r\nout of the question.  I was assured by well-informed people, that a man\r\nwho should try to improve, could not while living with other assigned\r\nservants;--his life would be one of intolerable misery and persecution.\r\nNor must the contamination of the convict-ships and prisons, both here\r\nand in England, be forgotten.  On the whole, as a place of punishment,\r\nthe object is scarcely gained; as a real system of reform it has\r\nfailed, as perhaps would every other plan; but as a means of making men\r\noutwardly honest,--of converting vagabonds, most useless in one\r\nhemisphere, into active citizens of another, and thus giving birth to a\r\nnew and splendid country--a grand centre of civilization--it has\r\nsucceeded to a degree perhaps unparalleled in history.\r\n\r\n\r\n30th.--The Beagle sailed for Hobart Town in Van Diemen's Land.  On the\r\n5th of February, after a six days' passage, of which the first part was\r\nfine, and the latter very cold and squally, we entered the mouth of\r\nStorm Bay: the weather justified this awful name.  The bay should\r\nrather be called an estuary, for it receives at its head the waters of\r\nthe Derwent.  Near the mouth, there are some extensive basaltic\r\nplatforms; but higher up the land becomes mountainous, and is covered\r\nby a light wood.  The lower parts of the hills which skirt the bay are\r\ncleared; and the bright yellow fields of corn, and dark green ones of\r\npotatoes, appear very luxuriant. Late in the evening we anchored in the\r\nsnug cove, on the shores of which stands the capital of Tasmania.  The\r\nfirst aspect of the place was very inferior to that of Sydney; the\r\nlatter might be called a city, this is only a town.  It stands at the\r\nbase of Mount Wellington, a mountain 3100 feet high, but of little\r\npicturesque beauty; from this source, however, it receives a good\r\nsupply of water.  Round the cove there are some fine warehouses and on\r\none side a small fort. Coming from the Spanish settlements, where such\r\nmagnificent care has generally been paid to the fortifications, the\r\nmeans of defence in these colonies appeared very contemptible.\r\nComparing the town with Sydney, I was chiefly struck with the\r\ncomparative fewness of the large houses, either built or building.\r\nHobart Town, from the census of 1835, contained 13,826 inhabitants, and\r\nthe whole of Tasmania 36,505.\r\n\r\nAll the aborigines have been removed to an island in Bass's Straits, so\r\nthat Van Diemen's Land enjoys the great advantage of being free from a\r\nnative population.  This most cruel step seems to have been quite\r\nunavoidable, as the only means of stopping a fearful succession of\r\nrobberies, burnings, and murders, committed by the blacks; and which\r\nsooner or later would have ended in their utter destruction. I fear\r\nthere is no doubt, that this train of evil and its consequences,\r\noriginated in the infamous conduct of some of our countrymen.  Thirty\r\nyears is a short period, in which to have banished the last aboriginal\r\nfrom his native island,--and that island nearly as large as Ireland.\r\nThe correspondence on this subject, which took place between the\r\ngovernment at home and that of Van Diemen's Land, is very interesting.\r\nAlthough numbers of natives were shot and taken prisoners in the\r\nskirmishing, which was going on at intervals for several years; nothing\r\nseems fully to have impressed them with the idea of our overwhelming\r\npower, until the whole island, in 1830, was put under martial law, and\r\nby proclamation the whole population commanded to assist in one great\r\nattempt to secure the entire race.  The plan adopted was nearly similar\r\nto that of the great hunting-matches in India: a line was formed\r\nreaching across the island, with the intention of driving the natives\r\ninto a _cul-de-sac_ on Tasman's peninsula. The attempt failed; the\r\nnatives, having tied up their dogs, stole during one night through the\r\nlines.  This is far from surprising, when their practised senses, and\r\nusual manner of crawling after wild animals is considered.  I have been\r\nassured that they can conceal themselves on almost bare ground, in a\r\nmanner which until witnessed is scarcely credible; their dusky bodies\r\nbeing easily mistaken for the blackened stumps which are scattered all\r\nover the country.  I was told of a trial between a party of Englishmen\r\nand a native, who was to stand in full view on the side of a bare hill;\r\nif the Englishmen closed their eyes for less than a minute, he would\r\nsquat down, and then they were never able to distinguish him from the\r\nsurrounding stumps.  But to return to the hunting-match; the natives\r\nunderstanding this kind of warfare, were terribly alarmed, for they at\r\nonce perceived the power and numbers of the whites.  Shortly afterwards\r\na party of thirteen belonging to two tribes came in; and, conscious of\r\ntheir unprotected condition, delivered themselves up in despair.\r\nSubsequently by the intrepid exertions of Mr. Robinson, an active and\r\nbenevolent man, who fearlessly visited by himself the most hostile of\r\nthe natives, the whole were induced to act in a similar manner.  They\r\nwere then removed to an island, where food and clothes were provided\r\nthem.  Count Strzelecki states, [6] that \"at the epoch of their\r\ndeportation in 1835, the number of natives amounted to 210.  In 1842,\r\nthat is, after the interval of seven years, they mustered only\r\nfifty-four individuals; and, while each family of the interior of New\r\nSouth Wales, uncontaminated by contact with the whites, swarms with\r\nchildren, those of Flinders' Island had during eight years an accession\r\nof only fourteen in number!\"\r\n\r\nThe Beagle stayed here ten days, and in this time I made several\r\npleasant little excursions, chiefly with the object of examining the\r\ngeological structure of the immediate neighbourhood.  The main points\r\nof interest consist, first in some highly fossiliferous strata,\r\nbelonging to the Devonian or Carboniferous period; secondly, in proofs\r\nof a late small rise of the land; and lastly, in a solitary and\r\nsuperficial patch of yellowish limestone or travertin, which contains\r\nnumerous impressions of leaves of trees, together with land-shells, not\r\nnow existing.  It is not improbable that this one small quarry includes\r\nthe only remaining record of the vegetation of Van Diemen's Land during\r\none former epoch.\r\n\r\nThe climate here is damper than in New South Wales, and hence the land\r\nis more fertile.  Agriculture flourishes; the cultivated fields look\r\nwell, and the gardens abound with thriving vegetables and fruit-trees.\r\nSome of the farm-houses, situated in retired spots, had a very\r\nattractive appearance. The general aspect of the vegetation is similar\r\nto that of Australia; perhaps it is a little more green and cheerful;\r\nand the pasture between the trees rather more abundant.  One day I took\r\na long walk on the side of the bay opposite to the town: I crossed in a\r\nsteam-boat, two of which are constantly plying backwards and forwards.\r\nThe machinery of one of these vessels was entirely manufactured in this\r\ncolony, which, from its very foundation, then numbered only three and\r\nthirty years!  Another day I ascended Mount Wellington; I took with me\r\na guide, for I failed in a first attempt, from the thickness of the\r\nwood.  Our guide, however, was a stupid fellow, and conducted us to the\r\nsouthern and damp side of the mountain, where the vegetation was very\r\nluxuriant; and where the labour of the ascent, from the number of\r\nrotten trunks, was almost as great as on a mountain in Tierra del Fuego\r\nor in Chiloe.  It cost us five and a half hours of hard climbing before\r\nwe reached the summit. In many parts the Eucalypti grew to a great\r\nsize, and composed a noble forest.  In some of the dampest ravines,\r\ntree-ferns flourished in an extraordinary manner; I saw one which must\r\nhave been at least twenty feet high to the base of the fronds, and was\r\nin girth exactly six feet.  The fronds forming the most elegant\r\nparasols, produced a gloomy shade, like that of the first hour of the\r\nnight.  The summit of the mountain is broad and flat, and is composed\r\nof huge angular masses of naked greenstone.  Its elevation is 3100 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.  The day was splendidly clear, and we\r\nenjoyed a most extensive view; to the north, the country appeared a\r\nmass of wooded mountains, of about the same height with that on which\r\nwe were standing, and with an equally tame outline: to the south the\r\nbroken land and water, forming many intricate bays, was mapped with\r\nclearness before us.  After staying some hours on the summit, we found\r\na better way to descend, but did not reach the Beagle till eight\r\no'clock, after a severe day's work.\r\n\r\nFebruary 7th.--The Beagle sailed from Tasmania, and, on the 6th of the\r\nensuing month, reached King George's Sound, situated close to the S. W.\r\ncorner of Australia.  We stayed there eight days; and we did not during\r\nour voyage pass a more dull and uninteresting time.  The country,\r\nviewed from an eminence, appears a woody plain, with here and there\r\nrounded and partly bare hills of granite protruding. One day I went out\r\nwith a party, in hopes of seeing a kangaroo hunt, and walked over a\r\ngood many miles of country. Everywhere we found the soil sandy, and\r\nvery poor; it supported either a coarse vegetation of thin, low\r\nbrushwood and wiry grass, or a forest of stunted trees.  The scenery\r\nresembled that of the high sandstone platform of the Blue Mountains;\r\nthe Casuarina (a tree somewhat resembling a Scotch fir) is, however,\r\nhere in greater number, and the Eucalyptus in rather less.  In the open\r\nparts there were many grass-trees,--a plant which, in appearance, has\r\nsome affinity with the palm; but, instead of being surmounted by a\r\ncrown of noble fronds, it can boast merely of a tuft of very coarse\r\ngrass-like leaves.  The general bright green colour of the brushwood\r\nand other plants, viewed from a distance, seemed to promise fertility.\r\nA single walk, however, was enough to dispel such an illusion; and he\r\nwho thinks with me will never wish to walk again in so uninviting a\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOne day I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to Bald Head; the place\r\nmentioned by so many navigators, where some imagined that they saw\r\ncorals, and others that they saw petrified trees, standing in the\r\nposition in which they had grown. According to our view, the beds have\r\nbeen formed by the wind having heaped up fine sand, composed of minute\r\nrounded particles of shells and corals, during which process branches\r\nand roots of trees, together with many land-shells, became enclosed.\r\nThe whole then became consolidated by the percolation of calcareous\r\nmatter; and the cylindrical cavities left by the decaying of the wood,\r\nwere thus also filled up with a hard pseudo-stalactical stone.  The\r\nweather is now wearing away the softer parts, and in consequence the\r\nhard casts of the roots and branches of the trees project above the\r\nsurface, and, in a singularly deceptive manner, resemble the stumps of\r\na dead thicket.\r\n\r\nA large tribe of natives, called the White Cockatoo men happened to pay\r\nthe settlement a visit while we were there. These men, as well as those\r\nof the tribe belonging to King George's Sound, being tempted by the\r\noffer of some tubs of rice and sugar, were persuaded to hold a\r\n\"corrobery,\" or great dancing-party.  As soon as it grew dark, small\r\nfires were lighted, and the men commenced their toilet, which consisted\r\nin painting themselves white in spots and lines. As soon as all was\r\nready, large fires were kept blazing, round which the women and\r\nchildren were collected as spectators; the Cockatoo and King George's\r\nmen formed two distinct parties, and generally danced in answer to each\r\nother. The dancing consisted in their running either sideways or in\r\nIndian file into an open space, and stamping the ground with great\r\nforce as they marched together.  Their heavy footsteps were accompanied\r\nby a kind of grunt, by beating their clubs and spears together, and by\r\nvarious other gesticulations, such as extending their arms and\r\nwriggling their bodies.  It was a most rude, barbarous scene, and, to\r\nour ideas, without any sort of meaning; but we observed that the black\r\nwomen and children watched it with the greatest pleasure.  Perhaps\r\nthese dances originally represented actions, such as wars and\r\nvictories; there was one called the Emu dance, in which each man\r\nextended his arm in a bent manner, like the neck of that bird.  In\r\nanother dance, one man imitated the movements of a kangaroo grazing in\r\nthe woods, whilst a second crawled up, and pretended to spear him. When\r\nboth tribes mingled in the dance, the ground trembled with the\r\nheaviness of their steps, and the air resounded with their wild cries.\r\nEvery one appeared in high spirits, and the group of nearly naked\r\nfigures, viewed by the light of the blazing fires, all moving in\r\nhideous harmony, formed a perfect display of a festival amongst the\r\nlowest barbarians.  In Tierra del Fuego, we have beheld many curious\r\nscenes in savage life, but never, I think, one where the natives were\r\nin such high spirits, and so perfectly at their ease.  After the\r\ndancing was over, the whole party formed a great circle on the ground,\r\nand the boiled rice and sugar was distributed, to the delight of all.\r\n\r\nAfter several tedious delays from clouded weather, on the 14th of\r\nMarch, we gladly stood out of King George's Sound on our course to\r\nKeeling Island.  Farewell, Australia! you are a rising child, and\r\ndoubtless some day will reign a great princess in the South: but you\r\nare too great and ambitious for affection, yet not great enough for\r\nrespect.  I leave your shores without sorrow or regret.\r\n\r\n[1] It is remarkable how the same disease is modified in different\r\nclimates.  At the little island of St. Helena the introduction of\r\nscarlet fever is dreaded as a plague.  In some countries, foreigners\r\nand natives are as differently affected by certain contagious disorders\r\nas if they had been different animals; of which fact some instances\r\nhave occurred in Chile; and, according to Humboldt, in Mexico (Polit.\r\nEssay, New Spain, vol. iv.).\r\n\r\n[2] Narrative of Missionary Enterprise, p. 282.\r\n\r\n[3] Captain Beechey (chap. iv., vol. i.) states that the inhabitants of\r\nPitcairn Island are firmly convinced that after the arrival of every\r\nship they suffer cutaneous and other disorders.  Captain Beechey\r\nattributes this to the change of diet during the time of the visit. Dr.\r\nMacculloch (Western Isles, vol. ii. p. 32) says: \"It is asserted, that\r\non the arrival of a stranger (at St. Kilda) all the inhabitants, in the\r\ncommon phraseology, catch a cold.\" Dr. Macculloch considers the whole\r\ncase, although often previously affirmed, as ludicrous.  He adds,\r\nhowever, that \"the question was put by us to the inhabitants who\r\nunanimously agreed in the story.\" In Vancouver's Voyage, there is a\r\nsomewhat similar statement with respect to Otaheite.  Dr. Dieffenbach,\r\nin a note to his translation of the Journal, states that the same fact\r\nis universally believed by the inhabitants of the Chatham Islands, and\r\nin parts of New Zealand.  It is impossible that such a belief should\r\nhave become universal in the northern hemisphere, at the Antipodes, and\r\nin the Pacific, without some good foundation.  Humboldt (Polit. Essay\r\non King of New Spain, vol. iv.) says, that the great epidemics of\r\nPanama and Callao are \"marked\" by the arrival of ships from Chile,\r\nbecause the people from that temperate region, first experience the\r\nfatal effects of the torrid zones.  I may add, that I have heard it\r\nstated in Shropshire, that sheep, which have been imported from\r\nvessels, although themselves in a healthy condition, if placed in the\r\nsame fold with others, frequently produce sickness in the flock.\r\n\r\n[4] Travels in Australia, vol. i. p. 154.  I must express my obligation\r\nto Sir T. Mitchell, for several interesting personal communications on\r\nthe subject of these great valleys of New South Wales.\r\n\r\n[5] I was interested by finding here the hollow conical pitfall of the\r\nlion-ant, or some other insect; first a fly fell down the treacherous\r\nslope and immediately disappeared; then came a large but unwary ant;\r\nits struggles to escape being very violent, those curious little jets\r\nof sand, described by Kirby and Spence (Entomol., vol. i. p. 425) as\r\nbeing flirted by the insect's tail, were promptly directed against the\r\nexpected victim.  But the ant enjoyed a better fate than the fly, and\r\nescaped the fatal jaws which lay concealed at the base of the conical\r\nhollow.  This Australian pitfall was only about half the size of that\r\nmade by the European lion-ant.\r\n\r\n[6] Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, p.\r\n354.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nKEELING ISLAND:--CORAL FORMATIONS\r\n\r\nKeeling Island--Singular appearance--Scanty Flora--Transport of\r\nSeeds--Birds and Insects--Ebbing and flowing Springs--Fields of dead\r\nCoral--Stones transported in the roots of Trees--Great Crab--Stinging\r\nCorals--Coral eating Fish--Coral Formations--Lagoon Islands, or\r\nAtolls--Depth at which reef-building Corals can live--Vast Areas\r\ninterspersed with low Coral Islands--Subsidence of their\r\nfoundations--Barrier Reefs--Fringing Reefs--Conversion of Fringing\r\nReefs into Barrier Reefs, and into Atolls--Evidence of changes in\r\nLevel--Breaches in Barrier Reefs--Maldiva Atolls, their peculiar\r\nstructure--Dead and submerged Reefs--Areas of subsidence and\r\nelevation--Distribution of Volcanoes--Subsidence slow, and vast in\r\namount.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL 1st.--We arrived in view of the Keeling or Cocos Islands,\r\nsituated in the Indian Ocean, and about six hundred miles distant from\r\nthe coast of Sumatra.  This is one of the lagoon-islands (or atolls) of\r\ncoral formation, similar to those in the Low Archipelago which we\r\npassed near.  When the ship was in the channel at the entrance, Mr.\r\nLiesk, an English resident, came off in his boat.  The history of the\r\ninhabitants of this place, in as few words as possible, is as follows.\r\nAbout nine years ago, Mr. Hare, a worthless character, brought from the\r\nEast Indian archipelago a number of Malay slaves, which now including\r\nchildren, amount to more than a hundred.  Shortly afterwards, Captain\r\nRoss, who had before visited these islands in his merchant-ship,\r\narrived from England, bringing with him his family and goods for\r\nsettlement: along with him came Mr. Liesk, who had been a mate in his\r\nvessel. The Malay slaves soon ran away from the islet on which Mr. Hare\r\nwas settled, and joined Captain Ross's party.  Mr. Hare upon this was\r\nultimately obliged to leave the place.\r\n\r\nThe Malays are now nominally in a state of freedom, and certainly are\r\nso, as far as regards their personal treatment; but in most other\r\npoints they are considered as slaves.  From their discontented state,\r\nfrom the repeated removals from islet to islet, and perhaps also from a\r\nlittle mismanagement, things are not very prosperous.  The island has\r\nno domestic quadruped, excepting the pig, and the main vegetable\r\nproduction is the cocoa-nut.  The whole prosperity of the place depends\r\non this tree: the only exports being oil from the nut, and the nuts\r\nthemselves, which are taken to Singapore and Mauritius, where they are\r\nchiefly used, when grated, in making curries.  On the cocoa-nut, also,\r\nthe pigs, which are loaded with fat, almost entirely subsist, as do the\r\nducks and poultry.  Even a huge land-crab is furnished by nature with\r\nthe means to open and feed on this most useful production.\r\n\r\nThe ring-formed reef of the lagoon-island is surmounted in the greater\r\npart of its length by linear islets.  On the northern or leeward side,\r\nthere is an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage\r\nwithin.  On entering, the scene was very curious and rather pretty; its\r\nbeauty, however, entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding\r\ncolours.  The shallow, clear, and still water of the lagoon, resting in\r\nits greater part on white sand, is, when illumined by a vertical sun,\r\nof the most vivid green.  This brilliant expanse, several miles in\r\nwidth, is on all sides divided, either by a line of snow-white breakers\r\nfrom the dark heaving waters of the ocean, or from the blue vault of\r\nheaven by the strips of land, crowned by the level tops of the\r\ncocoa-nut trees.  As a white cloud here and there affords a pleasing\r\ncontrast with the azure sky, so in the lagoon, bands of living coral\r\ndarken the emerald green water.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after anchoring, I went on shore on Direction Island.\r\nThe strip of dry land is only a few hundred yards in width; on the\r\nlagoon side there is a white calcareous beach, the radiation from which\r\nunder this sultry climate was very oppressive; and on the outer coast,\r\na solid broad flat of coral-rock served to break the violence of the\r\nopen sea.  Excepting near the lagoon, where there is some sand, the\r\nland is entirely composed of rounded fragments of coral.  In such a\r\nloose, dry, stony soil, the climate of the intertropical regions alone\r\ncould produce a vigorous vegetation. On some of the smaller islets,\r\nnothing could be more elegant than the manner in which the young and\r\nfull-grown cocoa-nut trees, without destroying each other's symmetry,\r\nwere mingled into one wood.  A beach of glittering white sand formed a\r\nborder to these fairy spots.\r\n\r\nI will now give a sketch of the natural history of these islands,\r\nwhich, from its very paucity, possesses a peculiar interest.  The\r\ncocoa-nut tree, at first glance, seems to compose the whole wood; there\r\nare however, five or six other trees.  One of these grows to a very\r\nlarge size, but from the extremes of softness of its wood, is useless;\r\nanother sort affords excellent timber for ship-building.  Besides the\r\ntrees, the number of plants is exceedingly limited, and consists of\r\ninsignificant weeds.  In my collection, which includes, I believe,\r\nnearly the perfect Flora, there are twenty species, without reckoning a\r\nmoss, lichen, and fungus.  To this number two trees must be added; one\r\nof which was not in flower, and the other I only heard of.  The latter\r\nis a solitary tree of its kind, and grows near the beach, where,\r\nwithout doubt, the one seed was thrown up by the waves.  A Guilandina\r\nalso grows on only one of the islets.  I do not include in the above\r\nlist the sugar-cane, banana, some other vegetables, fruit-trees, and\r\nimported grasses.  As the islands consist entirely of coral, and at one\r\ntime must have existed as mere water-washed reefs, all their\r\nterrestrial productions must have been transported here by the waves of\r\nthe sea. In accordance with this, the Florula has quite the character\r\nof a refuge for the destitute: Professor Henslow informs me that of the\r\ntwenty species nineteen belong to different genera, and these again to\r\nno less than sixteen families! [1]\r\n\r\nIn Holman's [2] Travels an account is given, on the authority of Mr. A.\r\nS. Keating, who resided twelve months on these islands, of the various\r\nseeds and other bodies which have been known to have been washed on\r\nshore.  \"Seeds and plants from Sumatra and Java have been driven up by\r\nthe surf on the windward side of the islands.  Among them have been\r\nfound the Kimiri, native of Sumatra and the peninsula of Malacca; the\r\ncocoa-nut of Balci, known by its shape and size; the Dadass, which is\r\nplanted by the Malays with the pepper-vine, the latter intwining round\r\nits trunk, and supporting itself by the prickles on its stem; the\r\nsoap-tree; the castor-oil plant; trunks of the sago palm; and various\r\nkinds of seeds unknown to the Malays settled on the islands. These are\r\nall supposed to have been driven by the N. W. monsoon to the coast of\r\nNew Holland, and thence to these islands by the S. E. trade-wind. Large\r\nmasses of Java teak and Yellow wood have also been found, besides\r\nimmense trees of red and white cedar, and the blue gumwood of New\r\nHolland, in a perfectly sound condition.  All the hardy seeds, such as\r\ncreepers, retain their germinating power, but the softer kinds, among\r\nwhich is the mangostin, are destroyed in the passage.  Fishing-canoes,\r\napparently from Java, have at times been washed on shore.\" It is\r\ninteresting thus to discover how numerous the seeds are, which, coming\r\nfrom several countries, are drifted over the wide ocean.  Professor\r\nHenslow tells me, he believes that nearly all the plants which I\r\nbrought from these islands, are common littoral species in the East\r\nIndian archipelago.  From the direction, however, of the winds and\r\ncurrents, it seems scarcely possible that they could have come here in\r\na direct line.  If, as suggested with much probability by Mr. Keating,\r\nthey were first carried towards the coast of New Holland, and thence\r\ndrifted back together with the productions of that country, the seeds,\r\nbefore germinating, must have travelled between 1800 and 2400 miles.\r\n\r\nChamisso, [3] when describing the Radack Archipelago, situated in the\r\nwestern part of the Pacific, states that \"the sea brings to these\r\nislands the seeds and fruits of many trees, most of which have yet not\r\ngrown here.  The greater part of these seeds appear to have not yet\r\nlost the capability of growing.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also said that palms and bamboos from somewhere in the torrid\r\nzone, and trunks of northern firs, are washed on shore: these firs must\r\nhave come from an immense distance.  These facts are highly\r\ninteresting.  It cannot be doubted that if there were land-birds to\r\npick up the seeds when first cast on shore, and a soil better adapted\r\nfor their growth than the loose blocks of coral, that the most isolated\r\nof the lagoon-islands would in time possess a far more abundant Flora\r\nthan they now have.\r\n\r\nThe list of land animals is even poorer than that of the plants.  Some\r\nof the islets are inhabited by rats, which were brought in a ship from\r\nthe Mauritius, wrecked here.  These rats are considered by Mr.\r\nWaterhouse as identical with the English kind, but they are smaller,\r\nand more brightly coloured. There are no true land-birds, for a snipe\r\nand a rail (Rallus Phillippensis), though living entirely in the dry\r\nherbage, belong to the order of Waders.  Birds of this order are said\r\nto occur on several of the small low islands in the Pacific.  At\r\nAscension, where there is no land-bird, a rail (Porphyrio simplex) was\r\nshot near the summit of the mountain, and it was evidently a solitary\r\nstraggler.  At Tristan d'Acunha, where, according to Carmichael, there\r\nare only two land-birds, there is a coot.  From these facts I believe\r\nthat the waders, after the innumerable web-footed species, are\r\ngenerally the first colonists of small isolated islands.  I may add,\r\nthat whenever I noticed birds, not of oceanic species, very far out at\r\nsea, they always belonged to this order; and hence they would naturally\r\nbecome the earliest colonists of any remote point of land.\r\n\r\nOf reptiles I saw only one small lizard.  Of insects I took pains to\r\ncollect every kind.  Exclusive of spiders, which were numerous, there\r\nwere thirteen species. [4] Of these, one only was a beetle.  A small\r\nant swarmed by thousands under the loose dry blocks of coral, and was\r\nthe only true insect which was abundant.  Although the productions of\r\nthe land are thus scanty, if we look to the waters of the surrounding\r\nsea, the number of organic beings is indeed infinite.  Chamisso has\r\ndescribed [5] the natural history of a lagoon-island in the Radack\r\nArchipelago; and it is remarkable how closely its inhabitants, in\r\nnumber and kind, resemble those of Keeling Island.  There is one lizard\r\nand two waders, namely, a snipe and curlew.  Of plants there are\r\nnineteen species, including a fern; and some of these are the same with\r\nthose growing here, though on a spot so immensely remote, and in a\r\ndifferent ocean.\r\n\r\nThe long strips of land, forming the linear islets, have been raised\r\nonly to that height to which the surf can throw fragments of coral, and\r\nthe wind heap up calcareous sand. The solid flat of coral rock on the\r\noutside, by its breadth, breaks the first violence of the waves, which\r\notherwise, in a day, would sweep away these islets and all their\r\nproductions. The ocean and the land seem here struggling for mastery:\r\nalthough terra firma has obtained a footing, the denizens of the water\r\nthink their claim at least equally good.  In every part one meets\r\nhermit crabs of more than one species, [6] carrying on their backs the\r\nshells which they have stolen from the neighbouring beach.  Overhead,\r\nnumerous gannets, frigate-birds, and terns, rest on the trees; and the\r\nwood, from the many nests and from the smell of the atmosphere, might\r\nbe called a sea-rookery.  The gannets, sitting on their rude nests,\r\ngaze at one with a stupid yet angry air.  The noddies, as their name\r\nexpresses, are silly little creatures.  But there is one charming bird:\r\nit is a small, snow-white tern, which smoothly hovers at the distance\r\nof a few feet above one's head, its large black eye scanning, with\r\nquiet curiosity, your expression.  Little imagination is required to\r\nfancy that so light and delicate a body must be tenanted by some\r\nwandering fairy spirit.\r\n\r\nSunday, April 3rd.--After service I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to the\r\nsettlement, situated at the distance of some miles, on the point of an\r\nislet thickly covered with tall cocoa-nut trees.  Captain Ross and Mr.\r\nLiesk live in a large barn-like house open at both ends, and lined with\r\nmats made of woven bark.  The houses of the Malays are arranged along\r\nthe shore of the lagoon.  The whole place had rather a desolate aspect,\r\nfor there were no gardens to show the signs of care and cultivation.\r\nThe natives belong to different islands in the East Indian archipelago,\r\nbut all speak the same language: we saw the inhabitants of Borneo,\r\nCelebes, Java, and Sumatra.  In colour they resemble the Tahitians,\r\nfrom whom they do not widely differ in features.  Some of the women,\r\nhowever, show a good deal of the Chinese character.  I liked both their\r\ngeneral expressions and the sound of their voices. They appeared poor,\r\nand their houses were destitute of furniture; but it was evident, from\r\nthe plumpness of the little children, that cocoa-nuts and turtle afford\r\nno bad sustenance.\r\n\r\nOn this island the wells are situated, from which ships obtain water.\r\nAt first sight it appears not a little remarkable that the fresh water\r\nshould regularly ebb and flow with the tides; and it has even been\r\nimagined, that sand has the power of filtering the salt from the\r\nsea-water.  These ebbing wells are common on some of the low islands in\r\nthe West Indies. The compressed sand, or porous coral rock, is\r\npermeated like a sponge with the salt water, but the rain which falls\r\non the surface must sink to the level of the surrounding sea, and must\r\naccumulate there, displacing an equal bulk of the salt water.  As the\r\nwater in the lower part of the great sponge-like coral mass rises and\r\nfalls with the tides, so will the water near the surface; and this will\r\nkeep fresh, if the mass be sufficiently compact to prevent much\r\nmechanical admixture; but where the land consists of great loose blocks\r\nof coral with open interstices, if a well be dug, the water, as I have\r\nseen, is brackish.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we stayed to see a curious half superstitious scene acted\r\nby the Malay women.  A large wooden spoon dressed in garments, and\r\nwhich had been carried to the grave of a dead man, they pretend becomes\r\ninspired at the full of the moon, and will dance and jump about.  After\r\nthe proper preparations, the spoon, held by two women, became\r\nconvulsed, and danced in good time to the song of the surrounding\r\nchildren and women.  It was a most foolish spectacle; but Mr. Liesk\r\nmaintained that many of the Malays believed in its spiritual movements.\r\nThe dance did not commence till the moon had risen, and it was well\r\nworth remaining to behold her bright orb so quietly shining through the\r\nlong arms of the cocoa-nut trees as they waved in the evening breeze.\r\nThese scenes of the tropics are in themselves so delicious, that they\r\nalmost equal those dearer ones at home, to which we are bound by each\r\nbest feeling of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe next day I employed myself in examining the very interesting, yet\r\nsimple structure and origin of these islands. The water being unusually\r\nsmooth, I waded over the outer flat of dead rock as far as the living\r\nmounds of coral, on which the swell of the open sea breaks.  In some of\r\nthe gullies and hollows there were beautiful green and other coloured\r\nfishes, and the form and tints of many of the zoophytes were admirable.\r\nIt is excusable to grow enthusiastic over the infinite numbers of\r\norganic beings with which the sea of the tropics, so prodigal of life,\r\nteems; yet I must confess I think those naturalists who have described,\r\nin well-known words, the submarine grottoes decked with a thousand\r\nbeauties, have indulged in rather exuberant language.\r\n\r\nApril 6th.--I accompanied Captain Fitz Roy to an island at the head of\r\nthe lagoon: the channel was exceedingly intricate, winding through\r\nfields of delicately branched corals. We saw several turtle and two\r\nboats were then employed in catching them.  The water was so clear and\r\nshallow, that although at first a turtle quickly dives out of sight,\r\nyet in a canoe or boat under sail, the pursuers after no very long\r\nchase come up to it.  A man standing ready in the bow, at this moment\r\ndashes through the water upon the turtle's back; then clinging with\r\nboth hands by the shell of its neck, he is carried away till the animal\r\nbecomes exhausted and is secured. It was quite an interesting chase to\r\nsee the two boats thus doubling about, and the men dashing head\r\nforemost into the water trying to seize their prey.  Captain Moresby\r\ninforms me that in the Chagos archipelago in this same ocean, the\r\nnatives, by a horrible process, take the shell from the back of the\r\nliving turtle.  \"It is covered with burning charcoal, which causes the\r\nouter shell to curl upwards, it is then forced off with a knife, and\r\nbefore it becomes cold flattened between boards.  After this barbarous\r\nprocess the animal is suffered to regain its native element, where,\r\nafter a certain time, a new shell is formed; it is, however, too thin\r\nto be of any service, and the animal always appears languishing and\r\nsickly.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the head of the lagoon, we crossed a narrow islet,\r\nand found a great surf breaking on the windward coast.  I can hardly\r\nexplain the reason, but there is to my mind much grandeur in the view\r\nof the outer shores of these lagoon-islands.  There is a simplicity in\r\nthe barrier-like beach, the margin of green bushes and tall cocoa-nuts,\r\nthe solid flat of dead coral-rock, strewed here and there with great\r\nloose fragments, and the line of furious breakers, all rounding away\r\ntowards either hand.  The ocean throwing its waters over the broad reef\r\nappears an invincible, all-powerful enemy; yet we see it resisted, and\r\neven conquered, by means which at first seem most weak and inefficient.\r\nIt is not that the ocean spares the rock of coral; the great fragments\r\nscattered over the reef, and heaped on the beach, whence the tall\r\ncocoa-nut springs, plainly bespeak the unrelenting power of the waves.\r\nNor are any periods of repose granted.  The long swell caused by the\r\ngentle but steady action of the trade-wind, always blowing in one\r\ndirection over a wide area, causes breakers, almost equalling in force\r\nthose during a gale of wind in the temperate regions, and which never\r\ncease to rage.  It is impossible to behold these waves without feeling\r\na conviction that an island, though built of the hardest rock, let it\r\nbe porphyry, granite, or quartz, would ultimately yield and be\r\ndemolished by such an irresistible power.  Yet these low, insignificant\r\ncoral-islets stand and are victorious: for here another power, as an\r\nantagonist, takes part in the contest.  The organic forces separate the\r\natoms of carbonate of lime, one by one, from the foaming breakers, and\r\nunite them into a symmetrical structure.  Let the hurricane tear up its\r\nthousand huge fragments; yet what will that tell against the\r\naccumulated labour of myriads of architects at work night and day,\r\nmonth after month?  Thus do we see the soft and gelatinous body of a\r\npolypus, through the agency of the vital laws, conquering the great\r\nmechanical power of the waves of an ocean which neither the art of man\r\nnor the inanimate works of nature could successfully resist.\r\n\r\nWe did not return on board till late in the evening, for we stayed a\r\nlong time in the lagoon, examining the fields of coral and the gigantic\r\nshells of the chama, into which, if a man were to put his hand, he\r\nwould not, as long as the animal lived, be able to withdraw it.  Near\r\nthe head of the lagoon I was much surprised to find a wide area,\r\nconsiderably more than a mile square, covered with a forest of\r\ndelicately branching corals, which, though standing upright, were all\r\ndead and rotten.  At first I was quite at a loss to understand the\r\ncause afterwards it occurred to me that it was owing to the following\r\nrather curious combination of circumstances.  It should, however, first\r\nbe stated, that corals are not able to survive even a short exposure in\r\nthe air to the sun's rays, so that their upward limit of growth is\r\ndetermined by that of lowest water at spring tides.  It appears, from\r\nsome old charts, that the long island to windward was formerly\r\nseparated by wide channels into several islets; this fact is likewise\r\nindicated by the trees being younger on these portions.  Under the\r\nformer condition of the reef, a strong breeze, by throwing more water\r\nover the barrier, would tend to raise the level of the lagoon.  Now it\r\nacts in a directly contrary manner; for the water within the lagoon not\r\nonly is not increased by currents from the outside, but is itself blown\r\noutwards by the force of the wind.  Hence it is observed, that the tide\r\nnear the head of the lagoon does not rise so high during a strong\r\nbreeze as it does when it is calm.  This difference of level, although\r\nno doubt very small, has, I believe, caused the death of those\r\ncoral-groves, which under the former and more open condition of the\r\nouter reef has attained the utmost possible limit of upward growth.\r\n\r\nA few miles north of Keeling there is another small atoll, the lagoon\r\nof which is nearly filled up with coral-mud.  Captain Ross found\r\nembedded in the conglomerate on the outer coast, a well-rounded\r\nfragment of greenstone, rather larger than a man's head: he and the men\r\nwith him were so much surprised at this, that they brought it away and\r\npreserved it as a curiosity.  The occurrence of this one stone, where\r\nevery other particle of matter is calcareous, certainly is very\r\npuzzling.  The island has scarcely ever been visited, nor is it\r\nprobable that a ship had been wrecked there.  From the absence of any\r\nbetter explanation, I came to the conclusion that it must have come\r\nentangled in the roots of some large tree: when, however, I considered\r\nthe great distance from the nearest land, the combination of chances\r\nagainst a stone thus being entangled, the tree washed into the sea,\r\nfloated so far, then landed safely, and the stone finally so embedded\r\nas to allow of its discovery, I was almost afraid of imagining a means\r\nof transport apparently so improbable.  It was therefore with great\r\ninterest that I found Chamisso, the justly distinguished naturalist who\r\naccompanied Kotzebue, stating that the inhabitants of the Radack\r\narchipelago, a group of lagoon-islands in the midst of the Pacific,\r\nobtained stones for sharpening their instruments by searching the roots\r\nof trees which are cast upon the beach.  It will be evident that this\r\nmust have happened several times, since laws have been established that\r\nsuch stones belong to the chief, and a punishment is inflicted on any\r\none who attempts to steal them. When the isolated position of these\r\nsmall islands in the midst of a vast ocean--their great distance from\r\nany land excepting that of coral formation, attested by the value which\r\nthe inhabitants, who are such bold navigators, attach to a stone of any\r\nkind, [7]--and the slowness of the currents of the open sea, are all\r\nconsidered, the occurrence of pebbles thus transported does appear\r\nwonderful.  Stones may often be thus carried; and if the island on\r\nwhich they are stranded is constructed of any other substance besides\r\ncoral, they would scarcely attract attention, and their origin at least\r\nwould never be guessed.  Moreover, this agency may long escape\r\ndiscovery from the probability of trees, especially those loaded with\r\nstones, floating beneath the surface.  In the channels of Tierra del\r\nFuego large quantities of drift timber are cast upon the beach, yet it\r\nis extremely rare to meet a tree swimming on the water.  These facts\r\nmay possibly throw light on single stones, whether angular or rounded,\r\noccasionally found embedded in fine sedimentary masses.\r\n\r\nDuring another day I visited West Islet, on which the vegetation was\r\nperhaps more luxuriant than on any other. The cocoa-nut trees generally\r\ngrow separate, but here the young ones flourished beneath their tall\r\nparents, and formed with their long and curved fronds the most shady\r\narbours. Those alone who have tried it, know how delicious it is to be\r\nseated in such shade, and drink the cool pleasant fluid of the\r\ncocoa-nut.  In this island there is a large bay-like space, composed of\r\nthe finest white sand: it is quite level and is only covered by the\r\ntide at high water; from this large bay smaller creeks penetrate the\r\nsurrounding woods. To see a field of glittering white sand,\r\nrepresenting water, with the cocoa-nut trees extending their tall and\r\nwaving trunks around the margin, formed a singular and very pretty view.\r\n\r\nI have before alluded to a crab which lives on the cocoa-nuts; it is\r\nvery common on all parts of the dry land, and grows to a monstrous\r\nsize: it is closely allied or identical with the Birgos latro.  The\r\nfront pair of legs terminate in very strong and heavy pincers, and the\r\nlast pair are fitted with others weaker and much narrower.  It would at\r\nfirst be thought quite impossible for a crab to open a strong cocoa-nut\r\ncovered with the husk; but Mr. Liesk assures me that he has repeatedly\r\nseen this effected.  The crab begins by tearing the husk, fibre by\r\nfibre, and always from that end under which the three eye-holes are\r\nsituated; when this is completed, the crab commences hammering with its\r\nheavy claws on one of the eye-holes till an opening is made.  Then\r\nturning round its body, by the aid of its posterior and narrow pair of\r\npincers, it extracts the white albuminous substance. I think this is as\r\ncurious a case of instinct as ever I heard of, and likewise of\r\nadaptation in structure between two objects apparently so remote from\r\neach other in the scheme of nature, as a crab and a cocoa-nut tree. The\r\nBirgos is diurnal in its habits; but every night it is said to pay a\r\nvisit to the sea, no doubt for the purpose of moistening its branchiae.\r\nThe young are likewise hatched, and live for some time, on the coast.\r\nThese crabs inhabit deep burrows, which they hollow out beneath the\r\nroots of trees; and where they accumulate surprising quantities of the\r\npicked fibres of the cocoa-nut husk, on which they rest as on a bed.\r\nThe Malays sometimes take advantage of this, and collect the fibrous\r\nmass to use as junk.  These crabs are very good to eat; moreover, under\r\nthe tail of the larger ones there is a mass of fat, which, when melted,\r\nsometimes yields as much as a quart bottle full of limpid oil.  It has\r\nbeen stated by some authors that the Birgos crawls up the cocoa-nut\r\ntrees for the purpose of stealing the nuts: I very much doubt the\r\npossibility of this; but with the Pandanus [8] the task would be very\r\nmuch easier.  I was told by Mr. Liesk that on these islands the Birgos\r\nlives only on the nuts which have fallen to the ground.\r\n\r\nCaptain Moresby informs me that this crab inhabits the Chagos and\r\nSeychelle groups, but not the neighbouring Maldiva archipelago.  It\r\nformerly abounded at Mauritius, but only a few small ones are now found\r\nthere.  In the Pacific, this species, or one with closely allied\r\nhabits, is said [9] to inhabit a single coral island, north of the\r\nSociety group.  To show the wonderful strength of the front pair of\r\npincers, I may mention, that Captain Moresby confined one in a strong\r\ntin-box, which had held biscuits, the lid being secured with wire; but\r\nthe crab turned down the edges and escaped.  In turning down the edges,\r\nit actually punched many small holes quite through the tin!\r\n\r\nI was a good deal surprised by finding two species of coral of the\r\ngenus Millepora (M. complanata and alcicornis), possessed of the power\r\nof stinging.  The stony branches or plates, when taken fresh from the\r\nwater, have a harsh feel and are not slimy, although possessing a\r\nstrong and disagreeable smell.  The stinging property seems to vary in\r\ndifferent specimens: when a piece was pressed or rubbed on the tender\r\nskin of the face or arm, a pricking sensation was usually caused, which\r\ncame on after the interval of a second, and lasted only for a few\r\nminutes.  One day, however, by merely touching my face with one of the\r\nbranches, pain was instantaneously caused; it increased as usual after\r\na few seconds, and remaining sharp for some minutes, was perceptible\r\nfor half an hour afterwards.  The sensation was as bad as that from a\r\nnettle, but more like that caused by the Physalia or Portuguese\r\nman-of-war.  Little red spots were produced on the tender skin of the\r\narm, which appeared as if they would have formed watery pustules, but\r\ndid not.  M. Quoy mentions this case of the Millepora; and I have heard\r\nof stinging corals in the West Indies.  Many marine animals seem to\r\nhave this power of stinging: besides the Portuguese man-of-war, many\r\njelly-fish, and the Aplysia or sea-slug of the Cape de Verd Islands, it\r\nis stated in the voyage of the Astrolabe, that an Actinia or\r\nsea-anemone, as well as a flexible coralline allied to Sertularia, both\r\npossess this means of offence or defence.  In the East Indian sea, a\r\nstinging sea-weed is said to be found.\r\n\r\nTwo species of fish, of the genus Scarus, which are common here,\r\nexclusively feed on coral: both are coloured of a splendid\r\nbluish-green, one living invariably in the lagoon, and the other\r\namongst the outer breakers.  Mr. Liesk assured us, that he had\r\nrepeatedly seen whole shoals grazing with their strong bony jaws on the\r\ntops of the coral branches: I opened the intestines of several, and\r\nfound them distended with yellowish calcareous sandy mud.  The slimy\r\ndisgusting Holuthuriae (allied to our star-fish), which the Chinese\r\ngourmands are so fond of, also feed largely, as I am informed by Dr.\r\nAllan, on corals; and the bony apparatus within their bodies seems well\r\nadapted for this end.  These Holuthuriae, the fish, the numerous\r\nburrowing shells, and nereidous worms, which perforate every block of\r\ndead coral, must be very efficient agents in producing the fine white\r\nmud which lies at the bottom and on the shores of the lagoon.  A\r\nportion, however, of this mud, which when wet resembled pounded chalk,\r\nwas found by Professor Ehrenberg to be partly composed of\r\nsiliceous-shielded infusoria.\r\n\r\nApril 12th.--In the morning we stood out of the lagoon on our passage\r\nto the Isle of France.  I am glad we have visited these islands: such\r\nformations surely rank high amongst the wonderful objects of this\r\nworld.  Captain Fitz Roy found no bottom with a line 7200 feet in\r\nlength, at the distance of only 2200 yards from the shore; hence this\r\nisland forms a lofty submarine mountain, with sides steeper even than\r\nthose of the most abrupt volcanic cone.  The saucer-shaped summit is\r\nnearly ten miles across; and every single atom, [10] from the least\r\nparticle to the largest fragment of rock, in this great pile, which\r\nhowever is small compared with very many other lagoon-islands, bears\r\nthe stamp of having been subjected to organic arrangement.  We feel\r\nsurprise when travellers tell us of the vast dimensions of the Pyramids\r\nand other great ruins, but how utterly insignificant are the greatest\r\nof these, when compared to these mountains of stone accumulated by the\r\nagency of various minute and tender animals!  This is a wonder which\r\ndoes not at first strike the eye of the body, but, after reflection,\r\nthe eye of reason.\r\n\r\nI will now give a very brief account of the three great classes of\r\ncoral-reefs; namely, Atolls, Barrier, and Fringing-reefs, and will\r\nexplain my views [11] on their formation.  Almost every voyager who has\r\ncrossed the Pacific has expressed his unbounded astonishment at the\r\nlagoon-islands, or as I shall for the future call them by their Indian\r\nname of atolls, and has attempted some explanation.  Even as long ago\r\nas the year 1605, Pyrard de Laval well exclaimed, \"C'est\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nune merveille de voir chacun de ces atollons, environne d'un grand banc\r\nde pierre tout autour, n'y ayant point d'artifice humain.\" The\r\naccompanying sketch of Whitsunday Island in the Pacific, copied from,\r\nCapt. Beechey's admirable Voyage, gives but a faint idea of the\r\nsingular aspect of an atoll: it is one of the smallest size, and has\r\nits narrow islets united together in a ring.  The immensity of the\r\nocean, the fury of the breakers, contrasted with the lowness of the\r\nland and the smoothness of the bright green water within the lagoon,\r\ncan hardly be imagined without having been seen.\r\n\r\nThe earlier voyagers fancied that the coral-building animals\r\ninstinctively built up their great circles to afford themselves\r\nprotection in the inner parts; but so far is this from the truth, that\r\nthose massive kinds, to whose growth on the exposed outer shores the\r\nvery existence of the reef depends, cannot live within the lagoon,\r\nwhere other delicately-branching kinds flourish.  Moreover, on this\r\nview, many species of distinct genera and families are supposed to\r\ncombine for one end; and of such a combination, not a single instance\r\ncan be found in the whole of nature.  The theory that has been most\r\ngenerally received is, that atolls are based on submarine craters; but\r\nwhen we consider the form and size of some, the number, proximity, and\r\nrelative positions of others, this idea loses its plausible character:\r\nthus Suadiva atoll is 44 geographical miles in diameter in one line, by\r\n34 miles in another line; Rimsky is 54 by 20 miles across, and it has a\r\nstrangely sinuous margin; Bow atoll is 30 miles long, and on an average\r\nonly 6 in width; Menchicoff atoll consists of three atolls united or\r\ntied together.  This theory, moreover, is totally inapplicable to the\r\nnorthern Maldiva atolls in the Indian Ocean (one of which is 88 miles\r\nin length, and between 10 and 20 in breadth), for they are not bounded\r\nlike ordinary atolls by narrow reefs, but by a vast number of separate\r\nlittle atolls; other little atolls rising out of the great central\r\nlagoon-like spaces.  A third and better theory was advanced by\r\nChamisso, who thought that from the corals growing more vigorously\r\nwhere exposed to the open sea, as undoubtedly is the case, the outer\r\nedges would grow up from the general foundation before any other part,\r\nand that this would account for the ring or cup-shaped structure.  But\r\nwe shall immediately see, that in this, as well as in the\r\ncrater-theory, a most important consideration has been overlooked,\r\nnamely, on what have the reef-building corals, which cannot live at a\r\ngreat depth, based their massive structures?\r\n\r\nNumerous soundings were carefully taken by Captain Fitz Roy on the\r\nsteep outside of Keeling atoll, and it was found that within ten\r\nfathoms, the prepared tallow at the bottom of the lead, invariably came\r\nup marked with the impression of living corals, but as perfectly clean\r\nas if it had been dropped on a carpet of turf; as the depth increased,\r\nthe impressions became less numerous, but the adhering particles of\r\nsand more and more numerous, until at last it was evident that the\r\nbottom consisted of a smooth sandy layer: to carry on the analogy of\r\nthe turf, the blades of grass grew thinner and thinner, till at last\r\nthe soil was so sterile, that nothing sprang from it.  From these\r\nobservations, confirmed by many others, it may be safely inferred that\r\nthe utmost depth at which corals can construct reefs is between 20 and\r\n30 fathoms. Now there are enormous areas in the Pacific and Indian\r\nOcean, in which every single island is of coral formation, and is\r\nraised only to that height to which the waves can throw up fragments,\r\nand the winds pile up sand.  Thus Radack group of atolls is an\r\nirregular square, 520 miles long and 240 broad; the Low Archipelago is\r\nelliptic-formed, 840 miles in its longer, and 420 in its shorter axis:\r\nthere are other small groups and single low islands between these two\r\narchipelagoes, making a linear space of ocean actually more than 4000\r\nmiles in length, in which not one single island rises above the\r\nspecified height.  Again, in the Indian Ocean there is a space of ocean\r\n1500 miles in length, including three archipelagoes, in which every\r\nisland is low and of coral formation.  From the fact of the\r\nreef-building corals not living at great depths, it is absolutely\r\ncertain that throughout these vast areas, wherever there is now an\r\natoll, a foundation must have originally existed within a depth of from\r\n20 to 30 fathoms from the surface.  It is improbable in the highest\r\ndegree that broad, lofty, isolated, steep-sided banks of sediment,\r\narranged in groups and lines hundreds of leagues in length, could have\r\nbeen deposited in the central and profoundest parts of the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans, at an immense distance from any continent, and where the\r\nwater is perfectly limpid.  It is equally improbable that the elevatory\r\nforces should have uplifted throughout the above vast areas,\r\ninnumerable great rocky banks within 20 to 30 fathoms, or 120 to 180\r\nfeet, of the surface of the sea, and not one single point above that\r\nlevel; for where on the whole surface of the globe can we find a single\r\nchain of mountains, even a few hundred miles in length, with their many\r\nsummits rising within a few feet of a given level, and not one pinnacle\r\nabove it?  If then the foundations, whence the atoll-building corals\r\nsprang, were not formed of sediment, and if they were not lifted up to\r\nthe required level, they must of necessity have subsided into it; and\r\nthis at once solves the difficulty.  For as mountain after mountain,\r\nand island after island, slowly sank beneath the water, fresh bases\r\nwould be successively afforded for the growth of the corals.  It is\r\nimpossible here to enter into all the necessary details, but I venture\r\nto defy [12] any one to explain in any other manner how it is possible\r\nthat numerous islands should be distributed throughout vast areas--all\r\nthe islands being low--all being built of corals, absolutely requiring\r\na foundation within a limited depth from the surface.\r\n\r\nBefore explaining how atoll-formed reefs acquire their peculiar\r\nstructure, we must turn to the second great class, namely,\r\nBarrier-reefs.  These either extend in straight lines in front of the\r\nshores of a continent or of a large island, or they encircle smaller\r\nislands; in both cases, being separated from the land by a broad and\r\nrather deep channel of water, analogous to the lagoon within an atoll.\r\nIt is remarkable how little attention has been paid to encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs; yet they are truly wonderful structures.  The following\r\nsketch represents part of the barrier encircling the island of Bolabola\r\nin the Pacific, as seen from one of the central peaks. In this instance\r\nthe whole line of reef has been converted into land; but usually a\r\nsnow-white line of great breakers, with only here and there a single\r\nlow islet crowned with cocoa-nut trees, divides the dark heaving waters\r\nof the ocean from the light-green expanse of the lagoon-channel.  And\r\nthe quiet waters of this channel generally bathe a fringe of low\r\nalluvial soil, loaded with the most beautiful productions of the\r\ntropics, and lying at the foot of the wild, abrupt, central mountains.\r\n\r\nEncircling barrier-reefs are of all sizes, from three miles to no less\r\nthan forty-four miles in diameter; and that which fronts one side, and\r\nencircles both ends, of New Caledonia, is 400 miles long.  Each reef\r\nincludes one, two, or several rocky islands of various heights; and in\r\none instance, even as many as twelve separate islands.  The reef runs\r\nat a greater or less distance from the included land; in the Society\r\narchipelago generally from one to three or four miles; but at Hogoleu\r\nthe reef is 20 miles on the southern side, and 14 miles on the opposite\r\nor northern side, from the included islands.  The depth within the\r\nlagoon-channel also varies much; from 10 to 30 fathoms may be taken as\r\nan average; but at Vanikoro there are spaces no less than 56 fathoms or\r\n363 feet deep.  Internally the reef either slopes gently into the\r\nlagoon-channel, or ends in a perpendicular wall sometimes between two\r\nand three hundred feet under water in height: externally the reef\r\nrises, like an atoll, with extreme abruptness out of the profound\r\ndepths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more singular than these structures?  We see\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nan island, which may be compared to a castle situated on the summit of\r\na lofty submarine mountain, protected by a great wall of coral-rock,\r\nalways steep externally and sometimes internally, with a broad level\r\nsummit, here and there breached by a narrow gateway, through which the\r\nlargest ships can enter the wide and deep encircling moat.\r\n\r\nAs far as the actual reef of coral is concerned, there is not the\r\nsmallest difference, in general size, outline, grouping, and even in\r\nquite trifling details of structure, between a barrier and an atoll.\r\nThe geographer Balbi has well remarked, that an encircled island is an\r\natoll with high land rising out of its lagoon; remove the land from\r\nwithin, and a perfect atoll is left.\r\n\r\nBut what has caused these reefs to spring up at such great distances\r\nfrom the shores of the included islands?  It cannot be that the corals\r\nwill not grow close to the land; for the shores within the\r\nlagoon-channel, when not surrounded by alluvial soil, are often fringed\r\nby living reefs; and we shall presently see that there is a whole\r\nclass, which I have called Fringing Reefs from their close attachment\r\nto the shores both of continents and of islands.  Again, on what have\r\nthe reef-building corals, which cannot live at great depths, based\r\ntheir encircling structures?  This is a great apparent difficulty,\r\nanalogous to that in the case of atolls, which has generally been\r\noverlooked.  It will be perceived more clearly by inspecting the\r\nfollowing sections which are real ones, taken in north and south lines,\r\nthrough the islands with their barrier-reefs, of Vanikoro, Gambier, and\r\nMaurua; and they are laid down, both vertically and horizontally, on\r\nthe same scale of a quarter of an inch to a mile.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that the sections might have been taken in any\r\ndirection through these islands, or through\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nmany other encircled islands, and the general features would have been\r\nthe same.  Now, bearing in mind that reef-building coral cannot live at\r\na greater depth than from 20 to 30 fathoms, and that the scale is so\r\nsmall that the plummets on the right hand show a depth of  200 fathoms,\r\non what are these barrier-reefs based?  Are we to suppose that each\r\nisland is surrounded by a collar-like submarine ledge of rock, or by a\r\ngreat bank of sediment, ending abruptly where the reef ends?\r\n\r\nIf the sea had formerly eaten deeply into the islands, before they were\r\nprotected by the reefs, thus having left a shallow ledge round them\r\nunder water, the present shores would have been invariably bounded by\r\ngreat precipices, but this is most rarely the case.  Moreover, on this\r\nnotion, it is not possible to explain why the corals should have sprung\r\nup, like a wall, from the extreme outer margin of the ledge, often\r\nleaving a broad space of water within, too deep for the growth of\r\ncorals.  The accumulation of a wide bank of sediment all round these\r\nislands, and generally widest where the included islands are smallest,\r\nis highly improbable, considering their exposed positions in the\r\ncentral and deepest parts of the ocean.  In the case of the\r\nbarrier-reef of New Caledonia, which extends for 150 miles beyond the\r\nnorthern point of the islands, in the same straight line with which it\r\nfronts the west coast, it is hardly possible to believe that a bank of\r\nsediment could thus have been straightly deposited in front of a lofty\r\nisland, and so far beyond its termination in the open sea.  Finally, if\r\nwe look to other oceanic islands of about the same height and of\r\nsimilar geological constitution, but not encircled by coral-reefs, we\r\nmay in vain search for so trifling a circumambient depth as 30 fathoms,\r\nexcept quite near to their shores; for usually land that rises abruptly\r\nout of water, as do most of the encircled and non-encircled oceanic\r\nislands, plunges abruptly under it.  On what then, I repeat, are these\r\nbarrier reefs based?  Why, with their wide and deep moat-like channels,\r\ndo they stand so far from the included land?  We shall soon see how\r\neasily these difficulties disappear.\r\n\r\nWe come now to our third class of Fringing-reefs, which will require a\r\nvery short notice.  Where the land slopes abruptly under water, these\r\nreefs are only a few yards in width, forming a mere ribbon or fringe\r\nround the shores: where the land slopes gently under the water the reef\r\nextends further, sometimes even as much as a mile from the land; but in\r\nsuch cases the soundings outside the reef always show that the\r\nsubmarine prolongation of the land is gently inclined. In fact, the\r\nreefs extend only to that distance from the shore, at which a\r\nfoundation within the requisite depth from 20 to 30 fathoms is found.\r\nAs far as the actual reef is concerned, there is no essential\r\ndifference between it and that forming a barrier or an atoll: it is,\r\nhowever, generally of less width, and consequently few islets have been\r\nformed on it.  From the corals growing more vigorously on the outside,\r\nand from the noxious effect of the sediment washed inwards, the outer\r\nedge of the reef is the highest part, and between it and the land there\r\nis generally a shallow sandy channel a few feet in depth.  Where banks\r\nor sediments have accumulated near to the surface, as in parts of the\r\nWest Indies, they sometimes become fringed with corals, and hence in\r\nsome degree resemble lagoon-islands or atolls, in the same manner as\r\nfringing-reefs, surrounding gently sloping islands, in some degree\r\nresemble barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo theory on the formation of coral-reefs can be considered\r\nsatisfactory which does not include the three great\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nclasses.  We have seen that we are driven to believe in the subsidence\r\nof those vast areas, interspersed with low islands, of which not one\r\nrises above the height to which the wind and waves can throw up matter,\r\nand yet are constructed by animals requiring a foundation, and that\r\nfoundation to lie at no great depth.  Let us then take an island\r\nsurrounded by fringing-reefs, which offer no difficulty in their\r\nstructure; and let this island with its reefs, represented by the\r\nunbroken lines in the woodcut, slowly subside.  Now, as the island\r\nsinks down, either a few feet at a time or quite insensibly, we may\r\nsafely infer, from what is known of the conditions favourable to the\r\ngrowth of coral, that the living masses, bathed by the surf on the\r\nmargin of the reef, will soon regain the surface.  The water, however,\r\nwill encroach little by little on the shore, the island becoming lower\r\nand smaller, and the space between the inner edge of the reef and the\r\nbeach proportionately broader.  A section of the reef and island in\r\nthis state, after a subsidence of several hundred feet, is given by the\r\ndotted lines.  Coral islets are supposed to have been formed on the\r\nreef; and a ship is anchored in the lagoon-channel.  This channel will\r\nbe more or less deep, according to the rate of subsidence, to the\r\namount of sediment accumulated in it, and to the growth of the\r\ndelicately branched corals which can live there.  The section in this\r\nstate resembles in every respect one drawn through an encircled island:\r\nin fact, it is a real section (on the scale of .517 of an inch to a\r\nmile) through Bolabola in the Pacific.  We can now at once see why\r\nencircling barrier-reefs stand so far from the shores which they front.\r\nWe can also perceive, that a line drawn perpendicularly down from the\r\nouter edge of the new reef, to the foundation of solid rock beneath the\r\nold fringing-reef, will exceed by as many feet as there have been feet\r\nof subsidence, that small limit of depth at which the effective corals\r\ncan live:--the little architects having built up their great wall-like\r\nmass, as the whole sank down, upon a basis formed of other corals and\r\ntheir consolidated fragments. Thus the difficulty on this head, which\r\nappeared so great, disappears.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of an island, we had taken the shore of a continent fringed\r\nwith reefs, and had imagined it to have subsided, a great straight\r\nbarrier, like that of Australia or New Caledonia, separated from the\r\nland by a wide and deep channel, would evidently have been the result.\r\n\r\nLet us take our new encircling barrier-reef, of which the section is\r\nnow represented by unbroken lines, and which, as I have said, is a real\r\nsection through Bolabola, and let it go on subsiding.  As the\r\nbarrier-reef slowly sinks down, the corals will go on vigorously\r\ngrowing upwards; but as the island sinks, the water will gain inch by\r\ninch on the shore--the separate mountains first forming separate\r\nislands within\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\none great reef--and finally, the last and highest pinnacle\r\ndisappearing.  The instant this takes place, a perfect atoll is formed:\r\nI have said, remove the high land from within an encircling\r\nbarrier-reef, and an atoll is left, and the land has been removed.  We\r\ncan now perceive how it comes that atolls, having sprung from\r\nencircling barrier-reefs, resemble them in general size, form, in the\r\nmanner in which they are grouped together, and in their arrangement in\r\nsingle or double lines; for they may be called rude outline charts of\r\nthe sunken islands over which they stand.  We can further see how it\r\narises that the atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans extend in lines\r\nparallel to the generally prevailing strike of the high islands and\r\ngreat coast-lines of those oceans.  I venture, therefore, to affirm,\r\nthat on the theory of the upward growth of the corals during the\r\nsinking of the land, [13] all the leading features in those wonderful\r\nstructures, the lagoon-islands or atolls, which have so long excited\r\nthe attention of voyagers, as well as in the no less wonderful\r\nbarrier-reefs, whether encircling small islands or stretching for\r\nhundreds of miles along the shores of a continent, are simply explained.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, whether I can offer any direct evidence of the\r\nsubsidence of barrier-reefs or atolls; but it must be borne in mind how\r\ndifficult it must ever be to detect a movement, the tendency of which\r\nis to hide under water the part affected.  Nevertheless, at Keeling\r\natoll I observed on all sides of the lagoon old cocoa-nut trees\r\nundermined and falling; and in one place the foundation-posts of a\r\nshed, which the inhabitants asserted had stood seven years before just\r\nabove high-water mark, but now was daily washed by every tide: on\r\ninquiry I found that three earthquakes, one of them severe, had been\r\nfelt here during the last ten years.  At Vanikoro, the lagoon-channel\r\nis remarkably deep, scarcely any alluvial soil has accumulated at the\r\nfoot of the lofty included mountains, and remarkably few islets have\r\nbeen formed by the heaping of fragments and sand on the wall-like\r\nbarrier reef; these facts, and some analogous ones, led me to believe\r\nthat this island must lately have subsided and the reef grown upwards:\r\nhere again earthquakes are frequent and very severe.  In the Society\r\narchipelago, on the other hand, where the lagoon-channels are almost\r\nchoked up, where much low alluvial land has accumulated, and where in\r\nsome cases long islets have been formed on the barrier-reefs--facts\r\nall showing that the islands have not very lately subsided--only feeble\r\nshocks are most rarely felt.  In these coral formations, where the land\r\nand water seem struggling for mastery, it must be ever difficult to\r\ndecide between the effects of a change in the set of the tides and of a\r\nslight subsidence: that many of these reefs and atolls are subject to\r\nchanges of some kind is certain; on some atolls the islets appear to\r\nhave increased greatly within a late period; on others they have been\r\npartially or wholly washed away.  The inhabitants of parts of the\r\nMaldiva archipelago know the date of the first formation of some\r\nislets; in other parts, the corals are now flourishing on water-washed\r\nreefs, where holes made for graves attest the former existence of\r\ninhabited land.  It is difficult to believe in frequent changes in the\r\ntidal currents of an open ocean; whereas, we have in the earthquakes\r\nrecorded by the natives on some atolls, and in the great fissures\r\nobserved on other atolls, plain evidence of changes and disturbances in\r\nprogress in the subterranean regions.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, on our theory, that coasts merely fringed by reefs\r\ncannot have subsided to any perceptible amount; and therefore they\r\nmust, since the growth of their corals, either have remained stationary\r\nor have been upheaved.  Now, it is remarkable how generally it can be\r\nshown, by the presence of upraised organic remains, that the fringed\r\nislands have been elevated: and so far, this is indirect evidence in\r\nfavour of our theory.  I was particularly struck with this fact, when I\r\nfound, to my surprise, that the descriptions given by MM. Quoy and\r\nGaimard were applicable, not to reefs in general as implied by them,\r\nbut only to those of the fringing class; my surprise, however, ceased\r\nwhen I afterwards found that, by a strange chance, all the several\r\nislands visited by these eminent naturalists, could be shown by their\r\nown statements to have been elevated within a recent geological era.\r\n\r\nNot only the grand features in the structure of barrier-reefs and of\r\natolls, and to their likeness to each other in form, size, and other\r\ncharacters, are explained on the theory of subsidence--which theory we\r\nare independently forced to admit in the very areas in question, from\r\nthe necessity of finding bases for the corals within the requisite\r\ndepth--but many details in structure and exceptional cases can thus\r\nalso be simply explained.  I will give only a few instances.  In\r\nbarrier-reefs it has long been remarked with surprise, that the\r\npassages through the reef exactly face valleys in the included land,\r\neven in cases where the reef is separated from the land by a\r\nlagoon-channel so wide and so much deeper than the actual passage\r\nitself, that it seems hardly possible that the very small quantity of\r\nwater or sediment brought down could injure the corals on the reef.\r\nNow, every reef of the fringing class is breached by a narrow gateway\r\nin front of the smallest rivulet, even if dry during the greater part\r\nof the year, for the mud, sand, or gravel, occasionally washed down\r\nkills the corals on which it is deposited.  Consequently, when an\r\nisland thus fringed subsides, though most of the narrow gateways will\r\nprobably become closed by the outward and upward growth of the corals,\r\nyet any that are not closed (and some must always be kept open by the\r\nsediment and impure water flowing out of the lagoon-channel) will still\r\ncontinue to front exactly the upper parts of those valleys, at the\r\nmouths of which the original basal fringing-reef was breached.\r\n\r\nWe can easily see how an island fronted only on one side, or on one\r\nside with one end or both ends encircled by barrier-reefs, might after\r\nlong-continued subsidence be converted either into a single wall-like\r\nreef, or into an atoll with a great straight spur projecting from it,\r\nor into two or three atolls tied together by straight reefs--all of\r\nwhich exceptional cases actually occur.  As the reef-building corals\r\nrequire food, are preyed upon by other animals, are killed by sediment,\r\ncannot adhere to a loose bottom, and may be easily carried down to a\r\ndepth whence they cannot spring up again, we need feel no surprise at\r\nthe reefs both of atolls and barriers becoming in parts imperfect.  The\r\ngreat barrier of New Caledonia is thus imperfect and broken in many\r\nparts; hence, after long subsidence, this great reef would not produce\r\none great atoll 400 miles in length, but a chain or archipelago of\r\natolls, of very nearly the same dimension with those in the Maldiva\r\narchipelago.  Moreover, in an atoll once breached on opposite sides,\r\nfrom the likelihood of the oceanic and tidal currents passing straight\r\nthrough the breaches, it is extremely improbable that the corals,\r\nespecially during continued subsidence, would ever be able again to\r\nunite the rim; if they did not, as the whole sank downwards, one atoll\r\nwould be divided into two or more.  In the Maldiva archipelago there\r\nare distinct atolls so related to each other in position, and separated\r\nby channels either unfathomable or very deep (the channel between Ross\r\nand Ari atolls is 150 fathoms, and that between the north and south\r\nNillandoo atolls is 200 fathoms in depth), that it is impossible to\r\nlook at a map of them without believing that they were once more\r\nintimately related.  And in this same archipelago, Mahlos-Mahdoo atoll\r\nis divided by a bifurcating channel from 100 to 132 fathoms in depth,\r\nin such a manner, that it is scarcely possible to say whether it ought\r\nstrictly to be called three separate atolls, or one great atoll not yet\r\nfinally divided.\r\n\r\nI will not enter on many more details; but I must remark that the\r\ncurious structure of the northern Maldiva atolls receives (taking into\r\nconsideration the free entrance of the sea through their broken\r\nmargins) a simple explanation in the upward and outward growth of the\r\ncorals, originally based both on small detached reefs in their lagoons,\r\nsuch as occur in common atolls, and on broken portions of the linear\r\nmarginal reef, such as bounds every atoll of the ordinary form.  I\r\ncannot refrain from once again remarking on the singularity of these\r\ncomplex structures--a great sandy and generally concave disk rises\r\nabruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse studded,\r\nand its edge symmetrically bordered with oval basins of coral-rock just\r\nlipping the surface of the sea, sometimes clothed with vegetation, and\r\neach containing a lake of clear water!\r\n\r\nOne more point in detail: as in the two neighbouring archipelagoes\r\ncorals flourish in one and not in the other, and as so many conditions\r\nbefore enumerated must affect their existence, it would be an\r\ninexplicable fact if, during the changes to which earth, air, and water\r\nare subjected, the reef-building corals were to keep alive for\r\nperpetuity on any one spot or area.  And as by our theory the areas\r\nincluding atolls and barrier-reefs are subsiding, we ought occasionally\r\nto find reefs both dead and submerged.  In all reefs, owing to the\r\nsediment being washed out of the lagoon-channel to leeward, that side\r\nis least favourable to the long-continued vigorous growth of the\r\ncorals; hence dead portions of reef not unfrequently occur on the\r\nleeward side; and these, though still retaining their proper wall-like\r\nform, are now in several instances sunk several fathoms beneath the\r\nsurface.  The Chagos group appears from some cause, possibly from the\r\nsubsidence having been too rapid, at present to be much less favourably\r\ncircumstanced for the growth of reefs than formerly: one atoll has a\r\nportion of its marginal reef, nine miles in length, dead and submerged;\r\na second has only a few quite small living points which rise to the\r\nsurface, a third and fourth are entirely dead and submerged; a fifth is\r\na mere wreck, with its structure almost obliterated.  It is remarkable\r\nthat in all these cases, the dead reefs and portions of reef lie at\r\nnearly the same depth, namely, from six to eight fathoms beneath the\r\nsurface, as if they had been carried down by one uniform movement.  One\r\nof these \"half-drowned atolls,\" so called by Capt. Moresby (to whom I\r\nam indebted for much invaluable information), is of vast size, namely,\r\nninety nautical miles across in one direction, and seventy miles in\r\nanother line; and is in many respects eminently curious.  As by our\r\ntheory it follows that new atolls will generally be formed in each new\r\narea of subsidence, two weighty objections might have been raised,\r\nnamely, that atolls must be increasing indefinitely in number; and\r\nsecondly, that in old areas of subsidence each separate atoll must be\r\nincreasing indefinitely in thickness, if proofs of their occasional\r\ndestruction could not have been adduced. Thus have we traced the\r\nhistory of these great rings of coral-rock, from their first origin\r\nthrough their normal changes, and through the occasional accidents of\r\ntheir existence, to their death and final obliteration.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my volume on \"Coral Formations\" I have published a map, in which I\r\nhave coloured all the atolls dark-blue, the barrier-reefs pale-blue,\r\nand the fringing reefs red.  These latter reefs have been formed whilst\r\nthe land has been stationary, or, as appears from the frequent presence\r\nof upraised organic remains, whilst it has been slowly rising: atolls\r\nand barrier-reefs, on the other hand, have grown up during the directly\r\nopposite movement of subsidence, which movement must have been very\r\ngradual, and in the case of atolls so vast in amount as to have buried\r\nevery mountain-summit over wide ocean-spaces.  Now in this map we see\r\nthat the reefs tinted pale and dark-blue, which have been produced by\r\nthe same order of movement, as a general rule manifestly stand near\r\neach other.  Again we see, that the areas with the two blue tints are\r\nof wide extent; and that they lie separate from extensive lines of\r\ncoast coloured red, both of which circumstances might naturally have\r\nbeen inferred, on the theory of the nature of the reefs having been\r\ngoverned by the nature of the earth's movement.  It deserves notice\r\nthat in more than one instance where single red and blue circles\r\napproach near each other, I can show that there have been oscillations\r\nof level; for in such cases the red or fringed circles consist of\r\natolls, originally by our theory formed during subsidence, but\r\nsubsequently upheaved; and on the other hand, some of the pale-blue or\r\nencircled islands are composed of coral-rock, which must have been\r\nuplifted to its present height before that subsidence took place,\r\nduring which the existing barrier-reefs grew upwards.\r\n\r\nAuthors have noticed with surprise, that although atolls are the\r\ncommonest coral-structures throughout some enormous oceanic tracts,\r\nthey are entirely absent in other seas, as in the West Indies: we can\r\nnow at once perceive the cause, for where there has not been\r\nsubsidence, atolls cannot have been formed; and in the case of the West\r\nIndies and parts of the East Indies, these tracts are known to have\r\nbeen rising within the recent period.  The larger areas, coloured red\r\nand blue, are all elongated; and between the two colours there is a\r\ndegree of rude alternation, as if the rising of one had balanced the\r\nsinking of the other.  Taking into consideration the proofs of recent\r\nelevation both on the fringed coasts and on some others (for instance,\r\nin South America) where there are no reefs, we are led to conclude that\r\nthe great continents are for the most part rising areas: and from the\r\nnature of the coral-reefs, that the central parts of the great oceans\r\nare sinking areas.  The East Indian archipelago, the most broken land\r\nin the world, is in most parts an area of elevation, but surrounded and\r\npenetrated, probably in more lines than one, by narrow areas of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nI have marked with vermilion spots all the many known active volcanos\r\nwithin the limits of this same map.  Their entire absence from every\r\none of the great subsiding areas, coloured either pale or dark blue, is\r\nmost striking and not less so is the coincidence of the chief volcanic\r\nchains with the parts coloured red, which we are led to conclude have\r\neither long remained stationary, or more generally have been recently\r\nupraised.  Although a few of the vermilion spots occur within no great\r\ndistance of single circles tinted blue, yet not one single active\r\nvolcano is situated within several hundred miles of an archipelago, or\r\neven small group of atolls.  It is, therefore, a striking fact that in\r\nthe Friendly archipelago, which consists of a group of atolls upheaved\r\nand since partially worn down, two volcanos, and perhaps more, are\r\nhistorically known to have been in action.  On the other hand, although\r\nmost of the islands in the Pacific which are encircled by\r\nbarrier-reefs, are of volcanic origin, often with the remnants of\r\ncraters still distinguishable, not one of them is known to have ever\r\nbeen in eruption.  Hence in these cases it would appear, that volcanos\r\nburst forth into action and become extinguished on the same spots,\r\naccordingly as elevatory or subsiding movements prevail there.\r\nNumberless facts could be adduced to prove that upraised organic\r\nremains are common wherever there are active volcanos; but until it\r\ncould be shown that in areas of subsidence, volcanos were either absent\r\nor inactive, the inference, however probable in itself, that their\r\ndistribution depended on the rising or falling of the earth's surface,\r\nwould have been hazardous.  But now, I think, we may freely admit this\r\nimportant deduction.\r\n\r\nTaking a final view of the map, and bearing in mind the statements made\r\nwith respect to the upraised organic remains, we must feel astonished\r\nat the vastness of the areas, which have suffered changes in level\r\neither downwards or upwards, within a period not geologically remote.\r\nIt would appear also, that the elevatory and subsiding movements follow\r\nnearly the same laws.  Throughout the spaces interspersed with atolls,\r\nwhere not a single peak of high land has been left above the level of\r\nthe sea, the sinking must have been immense in amount.  The sinking,\r\nmoreover, whether continuous, or recurrent with intervals sufficiently\r\nlong for the corals again to bring up their living edifices to the\r\nsurface, must necessarily have been extremely slow.  This conclusion is\r\nprobably the most important one which can be deduced from the study of\r\ncoral formations;--and it is one which it is difficult to imagine how\r\notherwise could ever have been arrived at.  Nor can I quite pass over\r\nthe probability of the former existence of large archipelagoes of lofty\r\nislands, where now only rings of coral-rock scarcely break the open\r\nexpanse of the sea, throwing some light on the distribution of the\r\ninhabitants of the other high islands, now left standing so immensely\r\nremote from each other in the midst of the great oceans.  The\r\nreef-constructing corals have indeed reared and preserved wonderful\r\nmemorials of the subterranean oscillations of level; we see in each\r\nbarrier-reef a proof that the land has there subsided, and in each\r\natoll a monument over an island now lost.  We may thus, like unto a\r\ngeologist who had lived his ten thousand years and kept a record of the\r\npassing changes, gain some insight into the great system by which the\r\nsurface of this globe has been broken up, and land and water\r\ninterchanged.\r\n\r\n[1] These Plants are described in the Annals of Nat.

From this point of view the aspect of\r\nthe island equalled the expectations raised by the many well-known\r\ndescriptions of its beautiful scenery.  The sloping plain of the\r\nPamplemousses, interspersed with houses, and coloured by the large\r\nfields of sugar-cane of a bright green, composed the foreground.  The\r\nbrilliancy of the green was the more remarkable because it is a colour\r\nwhich generally is conspicuous only from a very short distance. Towards\r\nthe centre of the island groups of wooded mountains rose out of this\r\nhighly cultivated plain; their summits, as so commonly happens with\r\nancient volcanic rocks, being jagged into the sharpest points. Masses\r\nof white clouds were collected around these pinnacles, as if for the\r\nsake of pleasing the stranger's eye.  The whole island, with its\r\nsloping border and central mountains, was adorned with an air of\r\nperfect elegance: the scenery, if I may use such an expression,\r\nappeared to the sight harmonious.\r\n\r\nI spent the greater part of the next day in walking about the town and\r\nvisiting different people.  The town is of considerable size, and is\r\nsaid to contain 20,000 inhabitants; the streets are very clean and\r\nregular.  Although the island has been so many years under the English\r\nGovernment, the general character of the place is quite French:\r\nEnglishmen speak to their servants in French, and the shops are all\r\nFrench; indeed, I should think that Calais or Boulogne was much more\r\nAnglified.  There is a very pretty little theatre, in which operas are\r\nexcellently performed.  We were also surprised at seeing large\r\nbooksellers' shops, with well-stored shelves;--music and reading\r\nbespeak our approach to the old world of civilization; for in truth\r\nboth Australia and America are new worlds.\r\n\r\nThe various races of men walking in the streets afford the most\r\ninteresting spectacle in Port Louis.  Convicts from India are banished\r\nhere for life; at present there are about 800, and they are employed in\r\nvarious public works.  Before seeing these people, I had no idea that\r\nthe inhabitants of India were such noble-looking figures.  Their skin\r\nis extremely dark, and many of the older men had large mustaches and\r\nbeards of a snow-white colour; this, together with the fire of their\r\nexpression, gave them quite an imposing aspect.  The greater number had\r\nbeen banished for murder and the worst crimes; others for causes which\r\ncan scarcely be considered as moral faults, such as for not obeying,\r\nfrom superstitious motives, the English laws.  These men are generally\r\nquiet and well-conducted; from their outward conduct, their\r\ncleanliness, and faithful observance of their strange religious rites,\r\nit was impossible to look at them with the same eyes as on our wretched\r\nconvicts in New South Wales.\r\n\r\nMay 1st.--Sunday.  I took a quiet walk along the sea-coast to the north\r\nof the town.  The plain in this part is quite uncultivated; it consists\r\nof a field of black lava, smoothed over with coarse grass and bushes,\r\nthe latter being chiefly Mimosas.  The scenery may be described as\r\nintermediate in character between that of the Galapagos and of Tahiti;\r\nbut this will convey a definite idea to very few persons.  It is a very\r\npleasant country, but it has not the charms of Tahiti, or the grandeur\r\nof Brazil.  The next day I ascended La Pouce, a mountain so called from\r\na thumb-like projection, which rises close behind the town to a height\r\nof 2,600 feet.  The centre of the island consists of a great platform,\r\nsurrounded by old broken basaltic mountains, with their strata dipping\r\nseawards.  The central platform, formed of comparatively recent streams\r\nof lava, is of an oval shape, thirteen geographical miles across, in\r\nthe line of its shorter axis.  The exterior bounding mountains come\r\ninto that class of structures called Craters of Elevation, which are\r\nsupposed to have been formed not like ordinary craters, but by a great\r\nand sudden upheaval.  There appears to me to be insuperable objections\r\nto this view: on the other hand, I can hardly believe, in this and in\r\nsome other cases, that these marginal crateriform mountains are merely\r\nthe basal remnants of immense volcanos, of which the summits either\r\nhave been blown off, or swallowed up in subterranean abysses.\r\n\r\nFrom our elevated position we enjoyed an excellent view over the\r\nisland.  The country on this side appears pretty well cultivated, being\r\ndivided into fields and studded with farm-houses. I was, however,\r\nassured that of the whole land, not more than half is yet in a\r\nproductive state; if such be the case, considering the present large\r\nexport of sugar, this island, at some future period when thickly\r\npeopled, will be of great value.  Since England has taken possession of\r\nit, a period of only twenty-five years, the export of sugar is said to\r\nhave increased seventy-five fold.  One great cause of its prosperity is\r\nthe excellent state of the roads.  In the neighbouring Isle of Bourbon,\r\nwhich remains under the French government, the roads are still in the\r\nsame miserable state as they were here only a few years ago.  Although\r\nthe French residents must have largely profited by the increased\r\nprosperity of their island, yet the English government is far from\r\npopular.\r\n\r\n3rd.--In the evening Captain Lloyd, the Surveyor-general, so well known\r\nfrom his examination of the Isthmus of Panama, invited Mr. Stokes and\r\nmyself to his country-house, which is situated on the edge of Wilheim\r\nPlains, and about six miles from the Port.  We stayed at this\r\ndelightful place two days; standing nearly 800 feet above the sea, the\r\nair was cool and fresh, and on every side there were delightful walks.\r\nClose by, a grand ravine has been worn to a depth of about 500 feet\r\nthrough the slightly inclined streams of lava, which have flowed from\r\nthe central platform.\r\n\r\n5th.--Captain Lloyd took us to the Riviere Noire, which is several\r\nmiles to the southward, that I might examine some rocks of elevated\r\ncoral.  We passed through pleasant gardens, and fine fields of\r\nsugar-cane growing amidst huge blocks of lava.  The roads were bordered\r\nby hedges of Mimosa, and near many of the houses there were avenues of\r\nthe mango.  Some of the views, where the peaked hills and the\r\ncultivated farms were seen together, were exceedingly picturesque; and\r\nwe were constantly tempted to exclaim, \"How pleasant it would be to\r\npass one's life in such quiet abodes!\" Captain Lloyd possessed an\r\nelephant, and he sent it half way with us, that we might enjoy a ride\r\nin true Indian fashion.  The circumstance which surprised me most was\r\nits quite noiseless step.  This elephant is the only one at present on\r\nthe island; but it is said others will be sent for.\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 9th.--We sailed from Port Louis, and, calling at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, on the 8th of July, we arrived off St. Helena.  This island, the\r\nforbidding aspect of which has been so often described, rises abruptly\r\nlike a huge black castle from the ocean.  Near the town, as if to\r\ncomplete nature's defence, small forts and guns fill up every gap in\r\nthe rugged rocks.  The town runs up a flat and narrow valley; the\r\nhouses look respectable, and are interspersed with a very few green\r\ntrees.  When approaching the anchorage there was one striking view: an\r\nirregular castle perched on the summit of a lofty hill, and surrounded\r\nby a few scattered fir-trees, boldly projected against the sky.\r\n\r\nThe next day I obtained lodgings within a stone's throw of Napoleon's\r\ntomb; [1] it was a capital central situation, whence I could make\r\nexcursions in every direction.  During the four days I stayed here, I\r\nwandered over the island from morning to night, and examined its\r\ngeological history.  My lodgings were situated at a height of about\r\n2000 feet; here the weather was cold and boisterous, with constant\r\nshowers of rain; and every now and then the whole scene was veiled in\r\nthick clouds.\r\n\r\nNear the coast the rough lava is quite bare: in the central and higher\r\nparts, feldspathic rocks by their decomposition have produced a clayey\r\nsoil, which, where not covered by vegetation, is stained in broad bands\r\nof many bright colours. At this season, the land moistened by constant\r\nshowers, produces a singularly bright green pasture, which lower and\r\nlower down, gradually fades away and at last disappears.  In latitude\r\n16 degs., and at the trifling elevation of 1500 feet, it is surprising\r\nto behold a vegetation possessing a character decidedly British.  The\r\nhills are crowned with irregular plantations of Scotch firs; and the\r\nsloping banks are thickly scattered over with thickets of gorse,\r\ncovered with its bright yellow flowers.  Weeping-willows are common on\r\nthe banks of the rivulets, and the hedges are made of the blackberry,\r\nproducing its well-known fruit.  When we consider that the number of\r\nplants now found on the island is 746, and that out of these fifty-two\r\nalone are indigenous species, the rest having been imported, and most\r\nof them from England, we see the reason of the British character of the\r\nvegetation. Many of these English plants appear to flourish better than\r\nin their native country; some also from the opposite quarter of\r\nAustralia succeed remarkably well.  The many imported species must have\r\ndestroyed some of the native kinds; and it is only on the highest and\r\nsteepest ridges that the indigenous Flora is now predominant.\r\n\r\nThe English, or rather Welsh character of the scenery, is kept up by\r\nthe numerous cottages and small white houses; some buried at the bottom\r\nof the deepest valleys, and others mounted on the crests of the lofty\r\nhills.  Some of the views are striking, for instance that from near Sir\r\nW. Doveton's house, where the bold peak called Lot is seen over a dark\r\nwood of firs, the whole being backed by the red water-worn mountains of\r\nthe southern coast.  On viewing the island from an eminence, the first\r\ncircumstance which strikes one, is the number of the roads and forts:\r\nthe labour bestowed on the public works, if one forgets its character\r\nas a prison, seems out of all proportion to its extent or value.  There\r\nis so little level or useful land, that it seems surprising how so many\r\npeople, about 5000, can subsist here.  The lower orders, or the\r\nemancipated slaves, are I believe extremely poor: they complain of the\r\nwant of work.  From the reduction in the number of public servants\r\nowing to the island having been given up by the East Indian Company,\r\nand the consequent emigration of many of the richer people, the poverty\r\nprobably will increase.  The chief food of the working class is rice\r\nwith a little salt meat; as neither of these articles are the products\r\nof the island, but must be purchased with money, the low wages tell\r\nheavily on the poor people. Now that the people are blessed with\r\nfreedom, a right which I believe they value fully, it seems probable\r\nthat their numbers will quickly increase: if so, what is to become of\r\nthe little state of St. Helena?\r\n\r\nMy guide was an elderly man, who had been a goatherd when a boy, and\r\nknew every step amongst the rocks.  He was of a race many times\r\ncrossed, and although with a dusky skin, he had not the disagreeable\r\nexpression of a mulatto.  He was a very civil, quiet old man, and such\r\nappears the character of the greater number of the lower classes.  It\r\nwas strange to my ears to hear a man, nearly white and respectably\r\ndressed, talking with indifference of the times when he was a slave.\r\nWith my companion, who carried our dinners and a horn of water, which\r\nis quite necessary, as all the water in the lower valleys is saline, I\r\nevery day took long walks.\r\n\r\nBeneath the upper and central green circle, the wild valleys are quite\r\ndesolate and untenanted.  Here, to the geologist, there were scenes of\r\nhigh interest, showing successive changes and complicated disturbances.\r\nAccording to my views, St. Helena has existed as an island from a very\r\nremote epoch: some obscure proofs, however, of the elevation of the\r\nland are still extant.  I believe that the central and highest peaks\r\nform parts of the rim of a great crater, the southern half of which has\r\nbeen entirely removed by the waves of the sea: there is, moreover, an\r\nexternal wall of black basaltic rocks, like the coast-mountains of\r\nMauritius, which are older than the central volcanic streams.  On the\r\nhigher parts of the island, considerable numbers of a shell, long\r\nthought to be a marine species occur imbedded in the soil.\r\n\r\nIt proved to be a Cochlogena, or land-shell of a very peculiar form;\r\n[2] with it I found six other kinds; and in another spot an eighth\r\nspecies.  It is remarkable that none of them are now found living.\r\nTheir extinction has probably been caused by the entire destruction of\r\nthe woods, and the consequent loss of food and shelter, which occurred\r\nduring the early part of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe history of the changes, which the elevated plains of Longwood and\r\nDeadwood have undergone, as given in General Beatson's account of the\r\nisland, is extremely curious. Both plains, it is said in former times\r\nwere covered with wood, and were therefore called the Great Wood.  So\r\nlate as the year 1716 there were many trees, but in 1724 the old trees\r\nhad mostly fallen; and as goats and hogs had been suffered to range\r\nabout, all the young trees had been killed. It appears also from the\r\nofficial records, that the trees were unexpectedly, some years\r\nafterwards, succeeded by a wire grass which spread over the whole\r\nsurface. [3] General Beatson adds that now this plain \"is covered with\r\nfine sward, and is become the finest piece of pasture on the island.\"\r\nThe extent of surface, probably covered by wood at a former period, is\r\nestimated at no less than two thousand acres; at the present day\r\nscarcely a single tree can be found there.  It is also said that in\r\n1709 there were quantities of dead trees in Sandy Bay; this place is\r\nnow so utterly desert, that nothing but so well attested an account\r\ncould have made me believe that they could ever have grown there.  The\r\nfact, that the goats and hogs destroyed all the young trees as they\r\nsprang up, and that in the course of time the old ones, which were safe\r\nfrom their attacks, perished from age, seems clearly made out.  Goats\r\nwere introduced in the year 1502; eighty-six years afterwards, in the\r\ntime of Cavendish, it is known that they were exceedingly numerous.\r\nMore than a century afterwards, in 1731, when the evil was complete and\r\nirretrievable, an order was issued that all stray animals should be\r\ndestroyed.  It is very interesting thus to find, that the arrival of\r\nanimals at St. Helena in 1501, did not change the whole aspect of the\r\nisland, until a period of two hundred and twenty years had elapsed: for\r\nthe goats were introduced in 1502, and in 1724 it is said \"the old\r\ntrees had mostly fallen.\" There can be little doubt that this great\r\nchange in the vegetation affected not only the land-shells, causing\r\neight species to become extinct, but likewise a multitude of insects.\r\n\r\nSt. Helena, situated so remote from any continent, in the midst of a\r\ngreat ocean, and possessing a unique Flora, excites our curiosity.  The\r\neight land-shells, though now extinct, and one living Succinea, are\r\npeculiar species found nowhere else.  Mr. Cuming, however, informs me\r\nthat an English Helix is common here, its eggs no doubt having been\r\nimported in some of the many introduced plants.  Mr. Cuming collected\r\non the coast sixteen species of sea-shells, of which seven, as far as\r\nhe knows, are confined to this island.  Birds and insects, [4] as might\r\nhave been expected, are very few in number; indeed I believe all the\r\nbirds have been introduced within late years.  Partridges and pheasants\r\nare tolerably abundant; the island is much too English not to be\r\nsubject to strict game-laws.  I was told of a more unjust sacrifice to\r\nsuch ordinances than I ever heard of even in England.  The poor people\r\nformerly used to burn a plant, which grows on the coast-rocks, and\r\nexport the soda from its ashes; but a peremptory order came out\r\nprohibiting this practice, and giving as a reason that the partridges\r\nwould have nowhere to build.\r\n\r\nIn my walks I passed more than once over the grassy plain bounded by\r\ndeep valleys, on which Longwood stands. Viewed from a short distance,\r\nit appears like a respectable gentleman's country-seat.  In front there\r\nare a few cultivated fields, and beyond them the smooth hill of\r\ncoloured rocks called the Flagstaff, and the rugged square black mass\r\nof the Barn.  On the whole the view was rather bleak and uninteresting.\r\nThe only inconvenience I suffered during my walks was from the\r\nimpetuous winds.  One day I noticed a curious circumstance; standing on\r\nthe edge of a plain, terminated by a great cliff of about a thousand\r\nfeet in depth, I saw at the distance of a few yards right to windward,\r\nsome tern, struggling against a very strong breeze, whilst, where I\r\nstood, the air was quite calm.  Approaching close to the brink, where\r\nthe current seemed to be deflected upwards from the face of the cliff,\r\nI stretched out my arm, and immediately felt the full force of the\r\nwind: an invisible barrier, two yards in width, separated perfectly\r\ncalm air from a strong blast.\r\n\r\nI so much enjoyed my rambles among the rocks and mountains of St.\r\nHelena, that I felt almost sorry on the morning of the 14th to descend\r\nto the town.  Before noon I was on board, and the Beagle made sail.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July we reached Ascension.  Those who have beheld a\r\nvolcanic island, situated under an arid climate, will at once be able\r\nto picture to themselves the appearance of Ascension.  They will\r\nimagine smooth conical hills of a bright red colour, with their summits\r\ngenerally truncated, rising separately out of a level surface of black\r\nrugged lava. A principal mound in the centre of the island, seems the\r\nfather of the lesser cones.  It is called Green Hill: its name being\r\ntaken from the faintest tinge of that colour, which at this time of the\r\nyear is barely perceptible from the anchorage.  To complete the\r\ndesolate scene, the black rocks on the coast are lashed by a wild and\r\nturbulent sea.\r\n\r\nThe settlement is near the beach; it consists of several houses and\r\nbarracks placed irregularly, but well built of white freestone.  The\r\nonly inhabitants are marines, and some negroes liberated from\r\nslave-ships, who are paid and victualled by government.  There is not a\r\nprivate person on the island.  Many of the marines appeared well\r\ncontented with their situation; they think it better to serve their\r\none-and-twenty years on shore, let it be what it may, than in a ship;\r\nin this choice, if I were a marine, I should most heartily agree.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I ascended Green Hill, 2840 feet high, and thence\r\nwalked across the island to the windward point. A good cart-road leads\r\nfrom the coast-settlement to the houses, gardens, and fields, placed\r\nnear the summit of the central mountain.  On the roadside there are\r\nmilestones, and likewise cisterns, where each thirsty passer-by can\r\ndrink some good water.  Similar care is displayed in each part of the\r\nestablishment, and especially in the management of the springs, so that\r\na single drop of water may not be lost: indeed the whole island may be\r\ncompared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order.  I could not help,\r\nwhen admiring the active industry, which had created such effects out\r\nof such means, at the same time regretting that it had been wasted on\r\nso poor and trifling an end.  M. Lesson has remarked with justice, that\r\nthe English nation would have thought of making the island of Ascension\r\na productive spot, any other people would have held it as a mere\r\nfortress in the ocean.\r\n\r\nNear this coast nothing grows; further inland, an occasional green\r\ncastor-oil plant, and a few grasshoppers, true friends of the desert,\r\nmay be met with.  Some grass is scattered over the surface of the\r\ncentral elevated region, and the whole much resembles the worse parts\r\nof the Welsh mountains. But scanty as the pasture appears, about six\r\nhundred sheep, many goats, a few cows and horses, all thrive well on\r\nit.  Of native animals, land-crabs and rats swarm in numbers. Whether\r\nthe rat is really indigenous, may well be doubted; there are two\r\nvarieties as described by Mr. Waterhouse; one is of a black colour,\r\nwith fine glossy fur, and lives on the grassy summit, the other is\r\nbrown-coloured and less glossy, with longer hairs, and lives near the\r\nsettlement on the coast.  Both these varieties are one-third smaller\r\nthan the common black rat (M. rattus); and they differ from it both in\r\nthe colour and character of their fur, but in no other essential\r\nrespect.  I can hardly doubt that these rats (like the common mouse,\r\nwhich has also run wild) have been imported, and, as at the Galapagos,\r\nhave varied from the effect of the new conditions to which they have\r\nbeen exposed: hence the variety on the summit of the island differs\r\nfrom that on the coast.  Of native birds there are none; but the\r\nguinea-fowl, imported from the Cape de Verd Islands, is abundant, and\r\nthe common fowl has likewise run wild.  Some cats, which were\r\noriginally turned out to destroy the rats and mice, have increased, so\r\nas to become a great plague.  The island is entirely without trees, in\r\nwhich, and in every other respect, it is very far inferior to St.\r\nHelena.\r\n\r\nOne of my excursions took me towards the S. W. extremity of the island.\r\nThe day was clear and hot, and I saw the island, not smiling with\r\nbeauty, but staring with naked hideousness.  The lava streams are\r\ncovered with hummocks, and are rugged to a degree which, geologically\r\nspeaking, is not of easy explanation.  The intervening spaces are\r\nconcealed with layers of pumice, ashes and volcanic tuff.  Whilst\r\npassing this end of the island at sea, I could not imagine what the\r\nwhite patches were with which the whole plain was mottled; I now found\r\nthat they were seafowl, sleeping in such full confidence, that even in\r\nmidday a man could walk up and seize hold of them.  These birds were\r\nthe only living creatures I saw during the whole day.  On the beach a\r\ngreat surf, although the breeze was light, came tumbling over the\r\nbroken lava rocks.\r\n\r\nThe geology of this island is in many respects interesting. In several\r\nplaces I noticed volcanic bombs, that is, masses of lava which have\r\nbeen shot through the air whilst fluid, and have consequently assumed a\r\nspherical or pear-shape.  Not only their external form, but, in several\r\ncases, their internal structure shows in a very curious manner that\r\nthey have revolved in their aerial course.  The internal structure of\r\none of these bombs, when broken, is represented very accurately in the\r\nwoodcut.  The central part is coarsely cellular, the cells decreasing\r\nin size towards the exterior; where there is a shell-like case about\r\nthe third of an inch in thickness, of compact stone, which again is\r\noverlaid by the outside crust of finely cellular lava.  I think there\r\ncan be little doubt, first that the external crust cooled rapidly in\r\nthe state in which we now see it; secondly, that the still fluid lava\r\nwithin, was packed by the centrifugal force, generated by\r\n\r\n[picture]\r\n\r\nthe revolving of the bomb, against the external cooled crust, and so\r\nproduced the solid shell of stone; and lastly, that the centrifugal\r\nforce, by relieving the pressure in the more central parts of the bomb,\r\nallowed the heated vapours to expand their cells, thus forming the\r\ncoarse cellular mass of the centre.\r\n\r\nA hill, formed of the older series of volcanic rocks, and which has\r\nbeen incorrectly considered as the crater of a volcano, is remarkable\r\nfrom its broad, slightly hollowed, and circular summit having been\r\nfilled up with many successive layers of ashes and fine scoriae.  These\r\nsaucer-shaped layers crop out on the margin, forming perfect rings of\r\nmany different colours, giving to the summit a most fantastic\r\nappearance; one of these rings is white and broad, and resembles a\r\ncourse round which horses have been exercised; hence the hill has been\r\ncalled the Devil's Riding School.  I brought away specimens of one of\r\nthe tufaceous layers of a pinkish colour and it is a most extraordinary\r\nfact, that Professor Ehrenberg [5] finds it almost wholly composed of\r\nmatter which has been organized: he detects in it some\r\nsiliceous-shielded fresh-water infusoria, and no less than twenty-five\r\ndifferent kinds of the siliceous tissue of plants, chiefly of grasses.\r\nFrom the absence of all carbonaceous matter, Professor Ehrenberg\r\nbelieves that these organic bodies have passed through the volcanic\r\nfire, and have been erupted in the state in which we now see them.  The\r\nappearance of the layers induced me to believe that they had been\r\ndeposited under water, though from the extreme dryness of the climate I\r\nwas forced to imagine, that torrents of rain had probably fallen during\r\nsome great eruption, and that thus a temporary lake had been formed\r\ninto which the ashes fell.  But it may now be suspected that the lake\r\nwas not a temporary one.  Anyhow, we may feel sure, that at some former\r\nepoch the climate and productions of Ascension were very different from\r\nwhat they now are.  Where on the face of the earth can we find a spot,\r\non which close investigation will not discover signs of that endless\r\ncycle of change, to which this earth has been, is, and will be\r\nsubjected?\r\n\r\nOn leaving Ascension, we sailed for Bahia, on the coast of Brazil, in\r\norder to complete the chronometrical measurement of the world.  We\r\narrived there on August 1st, and stayed four days, during which I took\r\nseveral long walks. I was glad to find my enjoyment in tropical scenery\r\nhad not decreased from the want of novelty, even in the slightest\r\ndegree.  The elements of the scenery are so simple, that they are worth\r\nmentioning, as a proof on what trifling circumstances exquisite natural\r\nbeauty depends.\r\n\r\nThe country may be described as a level plain of about three hundred\r\nfeet in elevation, which in all parts has been worn into flat-bottomed\r\nvalleys.  This structure is remarkable in a granitic land, but is\r\nnearly universal in all those softer formations of which plains are\r\nusually composed. The whole surface is covered by various kinds of\r\nstately trees, interspersed with patches of cultivated ground, out of\r\nwhich houses, convents, and chapels arise.  It must be remembered that\r\nwithin the tropics, the wild luxuriance of nature is not lost even in\r\nthe vicinity of large cities: for the natural vegetation of the hedges\r\nand hill-sides overpowers in picturesque effect the artificial labour\r\nof man. Hence, there are only a few spots where the bright red soil\r\naffords a strong contrast with the universal clothing of green.  From\r\nthe edges of the plain there are distant views either of the ocean, or\r\nof the great Bay with its low-wooded shores, and on which numerous\r\nboats and canoes show their white sails.  Excepting from these points,\r\nthe scene is extremely limited; following the level pathways, on each\r\nhand, only glimpses into the wooded valleys below can be obtained.  The\r\nhouses I may add, and especially the sacred edifices, are built in a\r\npeculiar and rather fantastic style of architecture.  They are all\r\nwhitewashed; so that when illumined by the brilliant sun of midday, and\r\nas seen against the pale blue sky of the horizon, they stand out more\r\nlike shadows than real buildings.\r\n\r\nSuch are the elements of the scenery, but it is a hopeless attempt to\r\npaint the general effect.  Learned naturalists describe these scenes of\r\nthe tropics by naming a multitude of objects, and mentioning some\r\ncharacteristic feature of each. To a learned traveller this possibly\r\nmay communicate some definite ideas: but who else from seeing a plant\r\nin an herbarium can imagine its appearance when growing in its native\r\nsoil?  Who from seeing choice plants in a hothouse, can magnify some\r\ninto the dimensions of forest trees, and crowd others into an entangled\r\njungle?  Who when examining in the cabinet of the entomologist the gay\r\nexotic butterflies, and singular cicadas, will associate with these\r\nlifeless objects, the ceaseless harsh music of the latter, and the lazy\r\nflight of the former,--the sure accompaniments of the still, glowing\r\nnoon-day of the tropics?  It is when the sun has attained its greatest\r\nheight, that such scenes should be viewed: then the dense splendid\r\nfoliage of the mango hides the ground with its darkest shade, whilst\r\nthe upper branches are rendered from the profusion of light of the most\r\nbrilliant green.  In the temperate zones the case is different--the\r\nvegetation there is not so dark or so rich, and hence the rays of the\r\ndeclining sun, tinged of a red, purple, or bright yellow color, add\r\nmost to the beauties of those climes.\r\n\r\nWhen quietly walking along the shady pathways, and admiring each\r\nsuccessive view, I wished to find language to express my ideas. Epithet\r\nafter epithet was found too weak to convey to those who have not\r\nvisited the intertropical regions, the sensation of delight which the\r\nmind experiences. I have said that the plants in a hothouse fail to\r\ncommunicate a just idea of the vegetation, yet I must recur to it.  The\r\nland is one great wild, untidy, luxuriant hothouse, made by Nature for\r\nherself, but taken possession of by man, who has studded it with gay\r\nhouses and formal gardens.  How great would be the desire in every\r\nadmirer of nature to behold, if such were possible, the scenery of\r\nanother planet! yet to every person in Europe, it may be truly said,\r\nthat at the distance of only a few degrees from his native soil, the\r\nglories of another world are opened to him.  In my last walk I stopped\r\nagain and again to gaze on these beauties, and endeavoured to fix in my\r\nmind for ever, an impression which at the time I knew sooner or later\r\nmust fail.  The form of the orange-tree, the cocoa-nut, the palm, the\r\nmango, the tree-fern, the banana, will remain clear and separate; but\r\nthe thousand beauties which unite these into one perfect scene must\r\nfade away: yet they will leave, like a tale heard in childhood, a\r\npicture full of indistinct, but most beautiful figures.\r\n\r\nAugust 6th.--In the afternoon we stood out to sea, with the intention\r\nof making a direct course to the Cape de Verd Islands.  Unfavourable\r\nwinds, however, delayed us, and on the 12th we ran into Pernambuco,--a\r\nlarge city on the coast of Brazil, in latitude 8 degs. south.  We\r\nanchored outside the reef; but in a short time a pilot came on board\r\nand took us into the inner harbour, where we lay close to the town.\r\n\r\nPernambuco is built on some narrow and low sand-banks, which are\r\nseparated from each other by shoal channels of salt water.  The three\r\nparts of the town are connected together by two long bridges built on\r\nwooden piles.  The town is in all parts disgusting, the streets being\r\nnarrow, ill-paved, and filthy; the houses, tall and gloomy.  The season\r\nof heavy rains had hardly come to an end, and hence the surrounding\r\ncountry, which is scarcely raised above the level of the sea, was\r\nflooded with water; and I failed in all my attempts to take walks.\r\n\r\nThe flat swampy land on which Pernambuco stands is surrounded, at the\r\ndistance of a few miles, by a semicircle of low hills, or rather by the\r\nedge of a country elevated perhaps two hundred feet above the sea.  The\r\nold city of Olinda stands on one extremity of this range.  One day I\r\ntook a canoe, and proceeded up one of the channels to visit it; I found\r\nthe old town from its situation both sweeter and cleaner than that of\r\nPernambuco.  I must here commemorate what happened for the first time\r\nduring our nearly five years' wandering, namely, having met with a want\r\nof politeness. I was refused in a sullen manner at two different\r\nhouses, and obtained with difficulty from a third, permission to pass\r\nthrough their gardens to an uncultivated hill, for the purpose of\r\nviewing the country.  I feel glad that this happened in the land of the\r\nBrazilians, for I bear them no good will--a land also of slavery, and\r\ntherefore of moral debasement.  A Spaniard would have felt ashamed at\r\nthe very thought of refusing such a request, or of behaving to a\r\nstranger with rudeness.  The channel by which we went to and returned\r\nfrom Olinda, was bordered on each side by mangroves, which sprang like\r\na miniature forest out of the greasy mud-banks.  The bright green\r\ncolour of these bushes always reminded me of the rank grass in a\r\nchurch-yard: both are nourished by putrid exhalations; the one speaks\r\nof death past, and the other too often of death to come.\r\n\r\nThe most curious object which I saw in this neighbourhood, was the reef\r\nthat forms the harbour.  I doubt whether in the whole world any other\r\nnatural structure has so artificial an appearance. [6] It runs for a\r\nlength of several miles in an absolutely straight line, parallel to,\r\nand not far distant from, the shore.  It varies in width from thirty to\r\nsixty yards, and its surface is level and smooth; it is composed of\r\nobscurely stratified hard sandstone.  At high water the waves break\r\nover it; at low water its summit is left dry, and it might then be\r\nmistaken for a breakwater erected by Cyclopean workmen.  On this coast\r\nthe currents of the sea tend to throw up in front of the land, long\r\nspits and bars of loose sand, and on one of these, part of the town of\r\nPernambuco stands.  In former times a long spit of this nature seems to\r\nhave become consolidated by the percolation of calcareous matter, and\r\nafterwards to have been gradually upheaved; the outer and loose parts\r\nduring this process having been worn away by the action of the sea, and\r\nthe solid nucleus left as we now see it.  Although night and day the\r\nwaves of the open Atlantic, turbid with sediment, are driven against\r\nthe steep outside edges of this wall of stone, yet the oldest pilots\r\nknow of no tradition of any change in its appearance.  This durability\r\nis much the most curious fact in its history: it is due to a tough\r\nlayer, a few inches thick, of calcareous matter, wholly formed by the\r\nsuccessive growth and death of the small shells of Serpulae, together\r\nwith some few barnacles and nulliporae.  These nulliporae, which are\r\nhard, very simply-organized sea-plants, play an analogous and important\r\npart in protecting the upper surfaces of coral-reefs, behind and within\r\nthe breakers, where the true corals, during the outward growth of the\r\nmass, become killed by exposure to the sun and air.  These\r\ninsignificant organic beings, especially the Serpulae, have done good\r\nservice to the people of Pernambuco; for without their protective aid\r\nthe bar of sandstone would inevitably have been long ago worn away and\r\nwithout the bar, there would have been no harbour.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of August we finally left the shores of Brazil. I thank\r\nGod, I shall never again visit a slave-country.  To this day, if I hear\r\na distant scream, it recalls with painful vividness my feelings, when\r\npassing a house near Pernambuco, I heard the most pitiable moans, and\r\ncould not but suspect that some poor slave was being tortured, yet knew\r\nthat I was as powerless as a child even to remonstrate.  I suspected\r\nthat these moans were from a tortured slave, for I was told that this\r\nwas the case in another instance.  Near Rio de Janeiro I lived opposite\r\nto an old lady, who kept screws to crush the fingers of her female\r\nslaves.  I have stayed in a house where a young household mulatto,\r\ndaily and hourly, was reviled, beaten, and persecuted enough to break\r\nthe spirit of the lowest animal.  I have seen a little boy, six or\r\nseven years old, struck thrice with a horse-whip (before I could\r\ninterfere) on his naked head, for having handed me a glass of water not\r\nquite clean; I saw his father tremble at a mere glance from his\r\nmaster's eye. These latter cruelties were witnessed by me in a Spanish\r\ncolony, in which it has always been said, that slaves are better\r\ntreated than by the Portuguese, English, or other European nations.  I\r\nhave seen at Rio de Janeiro a powerful negro afraid to ward off a blow\r\ndirected, as he thought, at his face.  I was present when a\r\nkind-hearted man was on the point of separating forever the men, women,\r\nand little children of a large number of families who had long lived\r\ntogether.  I will not even allude to the many heart-sickening\r\natrocities which I authentically heard of;--nor would I have mentioned\r\nthe above revolting details, had I not met with several people, so\r\nblinded by the constitutional gaiety of the negro as to speak of\r\nslavery as a tolerable evil.  Such people have generally visited at the\r\nhouses of the upper classes, where the domestic slaves are usually well\r\ntreated, and they have not, like myself, lived amongst the lower\r\nclasses.  Such inquirers will ask slaves about their condition; they\r\nforget that the slave must indeed be dull, who does not calculate on\r\nthe chance of his answer reaching his master's ears.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that self-interest will prevent excessive cruelty; as if\r\nself-interest protected our domestic animals, which are far less likely\r\nthan degraded slaves, to stir up the rage of their savage masters.  It\r\nis an argument long since protested against with noble feeling, and\r\nstrikingly exemplified, by the ever-illustrious Humboldt.  It is often\r\nattempted to palliate slavery by comparing the state of slaves with our\r\npoorer countrymen: if the misery of our poor be caused not by the laws\r\nof nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin; but how this\r\nbears on slavery, I cannot see; as well might the use of the\r\nthumb-screw be defended in one land, by showing that men in another\r\nland suffered from some dreadful disease.  Those who look tenderly at\r\nthe slave owner, and with a cold heart at the slave, never seem to put\r\nthemselves into the position of the latter; what a cheerless prospect,\r\nwith not even a hope of change! picture to yourself the chance, ever\r\nhanging over you, of your wife and your little children--those objects\r\nwhich nature urges even the slave to call his own--being torn from you\r\nand sold like beasts to the first bidder!  And these deeds are done and\r\npalliated by men, who profess to love their neighbours as themselves,\r\nwho believe in God, and pray that his Will be done on earth!  It makes\r\none's blood boil, yet heart tremble, to think that we Englishmen and\r\nour American descendants, with their boastful cry of liberty, have been\r\nand are so guilty: but it is a consolation to reflect, that we at least\r\nhave made a greater sacrifice, than ever made by any nation, to expiate\r\nour sin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the last day of August we anchored for the second time at Porto\r\nPraya in the Cape de Verd archipelago; thence we proceeded to the\r\nAzores, where we stayed six days.  On the 2nd of October we made the\r\nshore, of England; and at Falmouth I left the Beagle, having lived on\r\nboard the good little vessel nearly five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Voyage having come to an end, I will take a short retrospect of the\r\nadvantages and disadvantages, the pains and pleasures, of our\r\ncircumnavigation of the world.  If a person asked my advice, before\r\nundertaking a long voyage, my answer would depend upon his possessing a\r\ndecided taste for some branch of knowledge, which could by this means\r\nbe advanced.  No doubt it is a high satisfaction to behold various\r\ncountries and the many races of mankind, but the pleasures gained at\r\nthe time do not counterbalance the evils.  It is necessary to look\r\nforward to a harvest, however distant that may be, when some fruit will\r\nbe reaped, some good effected.\r\n\r\nMany of the losses which must be experienced are obvious; such as that\r\nof the society of every old friend, and of the sight of those places\r\nwith which every dearest remembrance is so intimately connected.  These\r\nlosses, however, are at the time partly relieved by the exhaustless\r\ndelight of anticipating the long wished-for day of return.  If, as\r\npoets say, life is a dream, I am sure in a voyage these are the visions\r\nwhich best serve to pass away the long night.  Other losses, although\r\nnot at first felt, tell heavily after a period: these are the want of\r\nroom, of seclusion, of rest; the jading feeling of constant hurry; the\r\nprivation of small luxuries, the loss of domestic society and even of\r\nmusic and the other pleasures of imagination.  When such trifles are\r\nmentioned, it is evident that the real grievances, excepting from\r\naccidents, of a sea-life are at an end.  The short space of sixty years\r\nhas made an astonishing difference in the facility of distant\r\nnavigation.  Even in the time of Cook, a man who left his fireside for\r\nsuch expeditions underwent severe privations. A yacht now, with every\r\nluxury of life, can circumnavigate the globe.  Besides the vast\r\nimprovements in ships and naval resources, the whole western shores of\r\nAmerica are thrown open, and Australia has become the capital of a\r\nrising continent.  How different are the circumstances to a man\r\nshipwrecked at the present day in the Pacific, to what they were in the\r\ntime of Cook!  Since his voyage a hemisphere has been added to the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\nIf a person suffer much from sea-sickness, let him weigh it heavily in\r\nthe balance.  I speak from experience: it is no trifling evil, cured in\r\na week.  If, on the other hand, he take pleasure in naval tactics, he\r\nwill assuredly have full scope for his taste.  But it must be borne in\r\nmind, how large a proportion of the time, during a long voyage, is\r\nspent on the water, as compared with the days in harbour.  And what are\r\nthe boasted glories of the illimitable ocean.  A tedious waste, a\r\ndesert of water, as the Arabian calls it.  No doubt there are some\r\ndelightful scenes.  A moonlight night, with the clear heavens and the\r\ndark glittering sea, and the white sails filled by the soft air of a\r\ngently blowing trade-wind, a dead calm, with the heaving surface\r\npolished like a mirror, and all still except the occasional flapping of\r\nthe canvas. It is well once to behold a squall with its rising arch and\r\ncoming fury, or the heavy gale of wind and mountainous waves.  I\r\nconfess, however, my imagination had painted something more grand, more\r\nterrific in the full-grown storm. It is an incomparably finer spectacle\r\nwhen beheld on shore, where the waving trees, the wild flight of the\r\nbirds, the dark shadows and bright lights, the rushing of the torrents\r\nall proclaim the strife of the unloosed elements.  At sea the albatross\r\nand little petrel fly as if the storm were their proper sphere, the\r\nwater rises and sinks as if fulfilling its usual task, the ship alone\r\nand its inhabitants seem the objects of wrath.  On a forlorn and\r\nweather-beaten coast, the scene is indeed different, but the feelings\r\npartake more of horror than of wild delight.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the brighter side of the past time.  The pleasure\r\nderived from beholding the scenery and the general aspect of the\r\nvarious countries we have visited, has decidedly been the most constant\r\nand highest source of enjoyment.  It is probable that the picturesque\r\nbeauty of many parts of Europe exceeds anything which we beheld.  But\r\nthere is a growing pleasure in comparing the character of the scenery\r\nin different countries, which to a certain degree is distinct from\r\nmerely admiring its beauty.  It depends chiefly on an acquaintance with\r\nthe individual parts of each view.  I am strongly induced to believe\r\nthat as in music, the person who understands every note will, if he\r\nalso possesses a proper taste, more thoroughly enjoy the whole, so he\r\nwho examines each part of a fine view, may also thoroughly comprehend\r\nthe full and combined effect.  Hence, a traveller should be a botanist,\r\nfor in all views plants form the chief embellishment.  Group masses of\r\nnaked rock, even in the wildest forms, and they may for a time afford a\r\nsublime spectacle, but they will soon grow monotonous.  Paint them with\r\nbright and varied colours, as in Northern Chile, they will become\r\nfantastic; clothe them with vegetation, they must form a decent, if not\r\na beautiful picture.\r\n\r\nWhen I say that the scenery of parts of Europe is probably superior to\r\nanything which we beheld, I except, as a class by itself, that of the\r\nintertropical zones.  The two classes cannot be compared together; but\r\nI have already often enlarged on the grandeur of those regions.  As the\r\nforce of impressions generally depends on preconceived ideas, I may\r\nadd, that mine were taken from the vivid descriptions in the Personal\r\nNarrative of Humboldt, which far exceed in merit anything else which I\r\nhave read.  Yet with these high-wrought ideas, my feelings were far\r\nfrom partaking of a tinge of disappointment on my first and final\r\nlanding on the shores of Brazil.\r\n\r\nAmong the scenes which are deeply impressed on my mind, none exceed in\r\nsublimity the primeval forests undefaced by the hand of man; whether\r\nthose of Brazil, where the powers of Life are predominant, or those of\r\nTierra del Fuego, where Death and decay prevail.  Both are temples\r\nfilled with the varied productions of the God of Nature:--no one can\r\nstand in these solitudes unmoved, and not feel that there is more in\r\nman than the mere breath of his body.  In calling up images of the\r\npast, I find that the plains of Patagonia frequently cross before my\r\neyes; yet these plains are pronounced by all wretched and useless. They\r\ncan be described only by negative characters; without habitations,\r\nwithout water, without trees, without mountains, they support merely a\r\nfew dwarf plants.  Why, then, and the case is not peculiar to myself,\r\nhave these arid wastes taken so firm a hold on my memory?  Why have not\r\nthe still more level, the greener and more fertile Pampas, which are\r\nserviceable to mankind, produced an equal impression?  I can scarcely\r\nanalyze these feelings: but it must be partly owing to the free scope\r\ngiven to the imagination.  The plains of Patagonia are boundless, for\r\nthey are scarcely passable, and hence unknown: they bear the stamp of\r\nhaving lasted, as they are now, for ages, and there appears no limit to\r\ntheir duration through future time.  If, as the ancients supposed, the\r\nflat earth was surrounded by an impassable breadth of water, or by\r\ndeserts heated to an intolerable excess, who would not look at these\r\nlast boundaries to man's knowledge with deep but ill-defined sensations?\r\n\r\nLastly, of natural scenery, the views from lofty mountains, through\r\ncertainly in one sense not beautiful, are very memorable.  When looking\r\ndown from the highest crest of the Cordillera, the mind, undisturbed by\r\nminute details, was filled with the stupendous dimensions of the\r\nsurrounding masses.\r\n\r\nOf individual objects, perhaps nothing is more certain to create\r\nastonishment than the first sight in his native haunt of a\r\nbarbarian--of man in his lowest and most savage state. One's mind\r\nhurries back over past centuries, and then asks, could our progenitors\r\nhave been men like these?--men, whose very signs and expressions are\r\nless intelligible to us than those of the domesticated animals; men,\r\nwho do not possess the instinct of those animals, nor yet appear to\r\nboast of human reason, or at least of arts consequent on that reason. I\r\ndo not believe it is possible to describe or paint the difference\r\nbetween savage and civilized man.  It is the difference between a wild\r\nand tame animal: and part of the interest in beholding a savage, is the\r\nsame which would lead every one to desire to see the lion in his\r\ndesert, the tiger tearing his prey in the jungle, or the rhinoceros\r\nwandering over the wild plains of Africa.\r\n\r\nAmong the other most remarkable spectacles which we have beheld, may be\r\nranked, the Southern Cross, the cloud of Magellan, and the other\r\nconstellations of the southern hemisphere--the water-spout--the glacier\r\nleading its blue stream of ice, overhanging the sea in a bold\r\nprecipice--a lagoon-island raised by the reef-building corals--an\r\nactive volcano--and the overwhelming effects of a violent earthquake.\r\nThese latter phenomena, perhaps, possess for me a peculiar interest,\r\nfrom their intimate connection with the geological structure of the\r\nworld.  The earthquake, however, must be to every one a most impressive\r\nevent: the earth, considered from our earliest childhood as the type of\r\nsolidity, has oscillated like a thin crust beneath our feet; and in\r\nseeing the laboured works of man in a moment overthrown, we feel the\r\ninsignificance of his boasted power.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that the love of the chase is an inherent delight in\r\nman--a relic of an instinctive passion.  If so, I am sure the pleasure\r\nof living in the open air, with the sky for a roof and the ground for a\r\ntable, is part of the same feeling, it is the savage returning to his\r\nwild and native habits.  I always look back to our boat cruises, and my\r\nland journeys, when through unfrequented countries, with an extreme\r\ndelight, which no scenes of civilization could have created.  I do not\r\ndoubt that every traveller must remember the glowing sense of happiness\r\nwhich he experienced, when he first breathed in a foreign clime, where\r\nthe civilized man had seldom or never trod.\r\n\r\nThere are several other sources of enjoyment in a long voyage, which\r\nare of a more reasonable nature.  The map of the world ceases to be a\r\nblank; it becomes a picture full of the most varied and animated\r\nfigures.  Each part assumes its proper dimensions: continents are not\r\nlooked at in the light of islands, or islands considered as mere\r\nspecks, which are, in truth, larger than many kingdoms of Europe.\r\nAfrica, or North and South America, are well-sounding names, and easily\r\npronounced; but it is not until having sailed for weeks along small\r\nportions of their shores, that one is thoroughly convinced what vast\r\nspaces on our immense world these names imply.\r\n\r\nFrom seeing the present state, it is impossible not to look forward\r\nwith high expectations to the future progress of nearly an entire\r\nhemisphere.  The march of improvement, consequent on the introduction\r\nof Christianity throughout the South Sea, probably stands by itself in\r\nthe records of history.  It is the more striking when we remember that\r\nonly sixty years since, Cook, whose excellent judgment none will\r\ndispute, could foresee no prospect of a change.  Yet these changes have\r\nnow been effected by the philanthropic spirit of the British nation.\r\n\r\nIn the same quarter of the globe Australia is rising, or indeed may be\r\nsaid to have risen, into a grand centre of civilization, which, at some\r\nnot very remote period, will rule as empress over the southern\r\nhemisphere.  It is impossible for an Englishman to behold these distant\r\ncolonies, without a high pride and satisfaction.  To hoist the British\r\nflag, seems to draw with it as a certain consequence, wealth,\r\nprosperity, and civilization.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it appears to me that nothing can be more improving to a\r\nyoung naturalist, than a journey in distant countries.  It both\r\nsharpens, and partly allays that want and craving, which, as Sir J.\r\nHerschel remarks, a man experiences although every corporeal sense be\r\nfully satisfied.  The excitement from the novelty of objects, and the\r\nchance of success, stimulate him to increased activity.  Moreover, as a\r\nnumber of isolated facts soon become uninteresting, the habit of\r\ncomparison leads to generalization.  On the other hand, as the\r\ntraveller stays but a short time in each place, his descriptions must\r\ngenerally consist of mere sketches, instead of detailed observations.\r\nHence arises, as I have found to my cost, a constant tendency to fill\r\nup the wide gaps of knowledge, by inaccurate and superficial hypotheses.\r\n\r\nBut I have too deeply enjoyed the voyage, not to recommend any\r\nnaturalist, although he must not expect to be so fortunate in his\r\ncompanions as I have been, to take all chances, and to start, on\r\ntravels by land if possible, if otherwise, on a long voyage.  He may\r\nfeel assured, he will meet with no difficulties or dangers, excepting\r\nin rare cases, nearly so bad as he beforehand anticipates.  In a moral\r\npoint of view, the effect ought to be, to teach him good-humoured\r\npatience, freedom from selfishness, the habit of acting for himself,\r\nand of making the best of every occurrence.  In short, he ought to\r\npartake of the characteristic qualities of most sailors.  Travelling\r\nought also to teach him distrust; but at the same time he will\r\ndiscover, how many truly kind-hearted people there are, with whom he\r\nnever before had, or ever again will have any further communication,\r\nwho yet are ready to offer him the most disinterested assistance.\r\n\r\n[1] After the volumes of eloquence which have poured forth on this\r\nsubject, it is dangerous even to mention the tomb.  A modern traveller,\r\nin twelve lines, burdens the poor little island with the following\r\ntitles,--it is a grave, tomb, pyramid, cemetery, sepulchre, catacomb,\r\nsarcophagus, minaret, and mausoleum!\r\n\r\n[2] It deserves notice, that all the many specimens of this shell found\r\nby me in one spot, differ as a marked variety, from another set of\r\nspecimens procured from a different spot.\r\n\r\n[3] Beatson's St. Helena.  Introductory chapter, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[4] Among these few insects, I was surprised to find a small Aphodius\r\n(nov. spec.) and an Oryctes, both extremely numerous under dung.  When\r\nthe island was discovered it certainly possessed no quadruped,\r\nexcepting perhaps a mouse: it becomes, therefore, a difficult point to\r\nascertain, whether these stercovorous insects have since been imported\r\nby accident, or if aborigines, on what food they formerly subsisted. On\r\nthe banks of the Plata, where, from the vast number of cattle and\r\nhorses, the fine plains of turf are richly manured, it is vain to seek\r\nthe many kinds of dung-feeding beetles, which occur so abundantly in\r\nEurope.  I observed only an Oryctes (the insects of this genus in\r\nEurope generally feed on decayed vegetable matter) and two species of\r\nPhanaeus, common in such situations.  On the opposite side of the\r\nCordillera in Chiloe, another species of Phanaeus is exceedingly\r\nabundant, and it buries the dung of the cattle in large earthen balls\r\nbeneath the ground.  There is reason to believe that the genus\r\nPhanaeus, before the introduction of cattle, acted as scavengers to\r\nman.  In Europe, beetles, which find support in the matter which has\r\nalready contributed towards the life of other and larger animals, are\r\nso numerous that there must be considerably more than one hundred\r\ndifferent species.  Considering this, and observing what a quantity of\r\nfood of this kind is lost on the plains of La Plata, I imagined I saw\r\nan instance where man had disturbed that chain, by which so many\r\nanimals are linked together in their native country.  In Van Diemen's\r\nLand, however, I found four species of Onthophagus, two of Aphodius,\r\nand one of a third genus, very abundantly under the dung of cows; yet\r\nthese latter animals had been then introduced only thirty-three years.\r\nPrevious to that time the kangaroo and some other small animals were\r\nthe only quadrupeds; and their dung is of a very different quality from\r\nthat of their successors introduced by man.  In England the greater\r\nnumber of stercovorous beetles are confined in their appetites; that\r\nis, they do not depend indifferently on any quadruped for the means of\r\nsubsistence.  The change, therefore, in habits which must have taken\r\nplace in Van Diemen's Land is highly remarkable.  I am indebted to the\r\nRev. F. W. Hope, who, I hope, will permit me to call him my master in\r\nEntomology, for giving me the names of the foregoing insects.\r\n\r\n[5] Monats. der Konig. Akad. d. Wiss. zu Berlin.
