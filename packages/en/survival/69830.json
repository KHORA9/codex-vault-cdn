After sixty years of\r\nvolcanoes I have learned reversal of preconceived notions. Gradually I\r\nhave learned a totally different approach.\r\n\r\nShaler of Harvard was my inspirer, worker in the wonders of swamp and\r\nice and sea beaches. He set me to work and turned me loose; among books\r\nand storm waves and men; especially among men, young men, ever reaping\r\nsomething new. When I chose volcanoes for my field Shaler said, “You\r\nhave certainly selected the hardest.” It was a missionary field, for in\r\nit people were being killed. But the products of internal earth fluids,\r\nlava sea bottom, and vast Canadian ancient meltings, seemed to promise\r\nreal natural history. Volcanoes squirt up the very ancient stuff of the\r\nsolar system. Therein, I knew, must be something for future discovery.\r\nThe investigation of it was a clear field, if action was the goal.\r\n\r\nMy field education in geology was by Hague, the friend of Archibald\r\nGeikie. By Emmons, skilled in ore deposits, and like Hague, trained by\r\nClarence King. By Bailey Willis, son of a poet, a superlative draftsman\r\nand field man, and a brilliant experimenter. I went into the American\r\nWest with these men.\r\n\r\nBut this story of a volcano experimenter’s life would have reached\r\nnowhere without Frank Alvord Perret, whom I first met on the slope\r\nof Vesuvius in 1906. I knew at once that he was the world’s greatest\r\nvolcanologist. His skill was taking pictures. Mine was making\r\nexperiments. We agreed that these two skills in action would accomplish\r\nwhat theories never could approach.\r\n\r\nPerret was an inventor. He was an artist. He was a poet. He was a lover\r\nof little children, and a worshiper of the music of the stars. Always\r\nin delicate health, he circled the world. I was with him on Sakurajima,\r\non Kilauea, and on Montserrat. We did not agree. He had a vast love of\r\nthe romantic and bizarre. I was always a sceptic. But I thank Heaven\r\nthat his posthumous and nobly illustrated book reached magnificent\r\npublication. His other books set a standard for all time for what the\r\nfield science of volcanoes shall be.\r\n\r\nPerret and his camera were my models. He gave me all of his pictures\r\nto use as I chose, and he and Tempest Anderson taught me volcano\r\nphotography. The latter, a Yorkshireman, was a British geographer and\r\nwe met on many volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this book is to tell what one man saw. I was actuated\r\nby the will to learn. I wanted to copy ripplemarks on the bottom of\r\nthe sea, to understand what force pushed up Harney Peak as coarse\r\ngranite in the Black Hills, and to imitate Yellowstone geysers spouting\r\nrhythmically. I wanted to know how cracks made the Cascade Mountains\r\npile up in a line.\r\n\r\nFinally, I studied the San Francisco earthquake rift, sliding open\r\nparallel to the shore for hundreds of miles. How thick was the crust\r\nof the globe? Then I was called to Hawaii, islands on a ridge 1,700\r\nmiles long with volcanoes at one end, coral atolls at the other. And I\r\nstarted a volcano experiment station at a very lucky time. Volcanoes\r\nproved surprisingly amenable to experiment.\r\n\r\nForty years of this lead far away from Lyell’s geology--the geology\r\nof uniform processes past and present--and from brachiopods and\r\ntrilobites. It lead to the ancestor of volcanoes. It lead to ancestral\r\ngas. It lead back 10 billion years. A lava splash might be a live\r\nsouvenir of that age. More than anything else, this belief pointed our\r\ninstruments down, to the inside of the globe.\r\n\r\nSix decades of a man’s life. Decades of geology, exploration,\r\nfoundation, outspreading, prediction, and fruition. The fact of\r\nfruition makes the telling worth while. Geological education was\r\nunbelief. Fruition was belief, verified by growth of unified science.\r\nCulmination was not geology but science. Uniformity, evolution, and\r\nsymmetry are in nature. Value and number are human. I have been called\r\ngeologist and seismologist, volcanologist and geophysicist. I am none\r\nof these. I am interested in the evolution of what Hoyle calls “This\r\nquite incredible universe.” I am just as interested in Bergson’s\r\n“Creative evolution” as in Hoyle and Lyttleton’s “New cosmology.”\r\nAnd more interested in life than in either. The elements of fruition\r\nare a thick earth crust, a comparable pattern for earth and moon,\r\nand a mechanism for earth core. This is the story of sixty years of\r\nvolcaneering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _My Experiments With_\r\n\r\n                               Volcanoes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                            Young Scientist\r\n\r\n      “_The gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the\r\n                             onyx stone._”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the training of my youth under a father who loved God’s\r\nout-of-doors that led me to Audubon’s birds; to tramping miles over\r\ncarries in Maine, Labrador, and Nova Scotia; and to fishing with\r\nanother eight year old, named Willie Grant.\r\n\r\nWhen I was fourteen my father the Reverend Thomas Augustus Jaggar, took\r\nour family to Europe, where botany and bird life were as much a part\r\nof my education as geography, French, and Italian. And it was during\r\nour visit in Italy that I made my first trip up Vesuvius. All of these\r\nearly interests convinced me that I wanted to be a naturalist.\r\n\r\nIt was Nathaniel Shaler at Harvard who told me to go and study the\r\nbeaches at Lynn and Nahant. So I walked and photographed, and measured\r\nripplemarks. I found a headland and a longshore accumulation with\r\nscallops dwindling regularly along the high-tide level. I found swash\r\nmarks a foot across forming as the tide went out. On the dunes were\r\nother sand waves beautifully regular.\r\n\r\nTry it. Lie on your stomach and watch them. They are at right angles to\r\nthe wind. Smooth them out and see what the wind does. It piles little\r\nflocculent heaps of course grains, each with an eddy downwind. The fine\r\nstuff migrates up the slopes forward with the wind, backward on the\r\nleeward side. The powder streams meet and lengthen the hills right and\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nI watched the swash marks. The swash of the surf full of sand rushed up\r\nthe beach, cleared suddenly, and retreated, leaving a ridge along the\r\nbeach. This elevation became the tide limit, and a new series started\r\nlower down. The swashes couldn’t climb over the ridge because the tide\r\nwas going out. And so for hours ridge after ridge was built.\r\n\r\nI watched high-tide scallops, six feet apart, forming heaps at the\r\ntop of the beach. The swash waves ran into the bays between the heaps\r\nduring the flood hours, making a rush up and a suck down. The rush up\r\nwas muddy, the suck down was clear. Pebbles and sand were building up\r\non the sides of the small promontories. Each heap was horseshoe-shaped,\r\nwith the toe seaward. Forty or fifty crescents got smaller and more\r\nsandy toward the middle of the beach. Here was rhythmic force making\r\nrepetition. The ripples and swash marks were repeated seaward. Clearly\r\nthe headland of rock was making pebbles and sand, sending pulsations\r\nalong the beach, instead of across it.\r\n\r\nThe ripplemarks were packed sand of the low-tide flat, formed totally\r\nunder water parallel to the waves. The back-and-forth motion of waves\r\nmade a pattern of sweep and eddy on the bottom. Were beaches, then,\r\nthings of habit like birds? Here were four kinds of sand waves, all\r\non one beach, all of them complicated by wind and water and tide; big\r\nand little; shapely and regular. The beach was alive. It was building\r\nfrom the end, it was rippling under wave action. It fed the wind as\r\nit dried, and the wind made an exquisite dune pattern of the grains.\r\nPerhaps beaches might be natural history, just as much as the birds\r\nthat inspired my interest in nature when I was eight years old.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the beaches drove me to a new discovery; to the\r\nuniversity library, where I found French and English references to\r\nripplemarks. I found experiments, soundings, fossil sandstone ripples.\r\nI learned that such great authors as the botanist De Candolle and Sir\r\nGeorge Darwin had interested themselves profoundly in what happened to\r\nthe sand grains. From the library I went to mud puddles in a tank and\r\nto experimentation. Thus I found my way from beach to books and from\r\nbooks to the making of baby beaches.\r\n\r\nLater, at Harvard, zoology and botany were all cells and embryos\r\nand the microscope. The habits of animals scarcely entered into our\r\nstudies. The natural history of Audubon and my boyhood had vanished.\r\nThe new words were phylogeny and cytology, development of the\r\nindividual, and cell development.\r\n\r\nSo in mineralogy the microscope and the tiny crystal governed; the\r\nmolecules of the crystal, and the chemical atoms of the molecule.\r\nScience was headed toward the infinitely little, though later, by\r\nway of the spectroscope, it was to leap to the infinitely big of the\r\nheavens. I never learned to think the universe finite.\r\n\r\nProfessor Shaler wrote in 1893, “In the next century there will be a\r\nstate of science in which the unknown will be conceived as peopled with\r\npowers whose existence is justly and necessarily inferred from the\r\nknowledge which has been obtained from their manifestations. In other\r\nwords, it seems to me that the naturalist is most likely to approach\r\nthe position of the philosophical theologian by paths which at first\r\nseemed to lie far apart from his domain.” Just this has happened in the\r\nworld of galaxies and electrons, producing Einstein and Planck, Jeans\r\nand Eddington, Hubble and Hoyle. And I suspect that sea bottoms and\r\nvolcanoes are “peopled with powers” yet to be inferred.\r\n\r\nThrough Josiah Cooke and his wonders of projection apparatus; through\r\nCook’s nephew Oliver Huntington and his mineral crystals; through John\r\nEliot Wolff, whose assistant in optical microscopy I became; through\r\nRobert Jackson with his museum collection technique and the hexagon\r\nplates on fossil sea urchins; through all these I was introduced to the\r\nlaboratory collections and instruments. I found a fascinating world.\r\n\r\nThe theater, too, furthered my education. Like many Harvard students,\r\nI “suped” for several great actors and actresses, among them Julia\r\nMarlowe and Sarah Bernhardt. And in one play I even had a speaking\r\npart: “My lord, Posthumus is without.” I also practiced legerdemain\r\nas amateur assistant to Kellar and Hermann, who called me out of the\r\naudience and pulled rabbits out of my coat and eggs out of my mouth.\r\nThus I learned of the psychology of audiences, how to experiment in\r\npublic, and how easily deluded is the average mind. Just so nature\r\nmay delude, if the scientist doesn’t keep his wits about him. But\r\nI also learned the value of vivid demonstration before students. A\r\ngreat exponent of this method of teaching is Professor Hubert Alyea of\r\nPrinceton. His chemical experimentation is marvellous. His chemistry\r\ntextbook is modern physical chemistry at its best. He demonstrates that\r\nthe art of the magician has come down to the twentieth century and that\r\neven mathematical science may pass over to the layman. I suspect that\r\ngeophysics does not need to be buried under differential equations as\r\nit is today. Certainly experimental volcanology made exciting at the\r\nlecture table could work wonders in getting the globe explored.\r\n\r\nAt Harvard we were taught that geology was a detective history.\r\nVaguely, the same fossils were the same age. Vaguely, man had come from\r\na fish which climbed up on the land. It was much later that radio\r\nactivity of rocks was accepted as setting ages in millions of years.\r\nKing and Kelvin taught us that the age of the earth was 24 million\r\nyears and the sun was dying. A half century later, 2,000 million years\r\nwas the figure and the sun was heating up. Now cosmogonists talk easily\r\nof 10,000 million years as an item in star history. I have learned that\r\none can have any theory he chooses, and that some new discovery will\r\nprobably reverse it. A discovery is the uncovering of an appealing,\r\nbright idea.\r\n\r\nThe idea of geology as history based on Darwin’s evolution never took\r\nroot in my consciousness. Geology to me is the science of the globe.\r\nScience studies how things work, how things change, how they accomplish\r\nwhat they do, how they grow, and how they compare. It does not study\r\nthe “why,” or the necessity for an origin of anything. Originating is\r\neternally in progress. Astronomy today is giving up origins. History\r\nbased on a few relics seems futile. Relics, or specimens, must be\r\ncompared with action.\r\n\r\nGuessing that we must have come from a fish, with no evolution sequence\r\nin successive strata and no mammals whatever in very ancient strata\r\nand no preservation of soft creatures possible, seems a contradiction\r\nof Darwin’s own testimony. He insisted on “the imperfection of the\r\ngeological record.” But he had no conception that the Cambrian was\r\n500 million years B.C., nor that the fiery Keewatin of Lake Superior\r\nwas 1,800 million years B.C. Darwin knew that the bivalve brachiopod\r\n_Lingula_, now alive in quiet seas, is exactly the same today as\r\nit was then.\r\n\r\n_Lingula_ is found fossilized in the intermediate geologic\r\neras. We have no proof that intelligent beings in ships from unknown\r\nlands did not dredge him up in Cambrian time. Five hundred million\r\nyears is so absurdly long that there may have been at least twenty\r\ndifferent flowerings of intelligence on the earth, having no relation\r\nto us. Continents are places of catastrophe. Sea bottoms are places\r\nof constancy. Man lives on continents, and his fossilized bones are\r\nshort-lived.\r\n\r\nIf each Adam preceded a new humankind of 100,000 years, the time since\r\nthe Cambrian allows for 5,000 deluges, or eruptive conflagrations.\r\nEach one would exterminate that particular Adam’s descendants. If\r\nglacial periods are deluges, we know their scratched boulders back to\r\n400 million years before _Lingula_. These older ice sheets were\r\nin Canada. But we know fiery floods of lava 1,300 million years before\r\n_Lingula_, on the north shore of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nWe have not one particle of evidence that before the race was killed\r\noff primordial volcanologists, who were very queer looking chaps, might\r\nhave studied those eruptions with expensive instruments. Certainly they\r\nhad a lot of copper at their disposal. Perhaps the great lakes were a\r\ncontinental sea, and some ancestor of _Lingula_ was scooped up for\r\nfood by those doomed beings.\r\n\r\nBut geology at Harvard was not all history. When R. A. Daly and I\r\nwere graduate students, we worked on Ascutney Mountain, studying\r\nancient fire-made granites. The hills were lumps of the ancient\r\npastes crystallized. The crystals were feldspars, mica, quartz, and\r\niron oxides. Oldest prisms were lime phosphate, the mineral apatite\r\ncontaining imprisoned brown glass. How did the several kinds of red\r\nhot paste invade the altered sedimentary slates? Was brown glass the\r\nancestor? Lava is brown glass. Some of the phosphate crystals contain\r\ngas bubbles and liquids. Daly, who published the work, found that\r\nancient lava pushed up while deep in the claystones, and shattered a\r\nhole by heat and cracking. The pieces sank and the paste or gas foam\r\nwas injected in successive lumps. Each new lump had more silica.\r\n\r\nApparently the fragments melted--some of the old sediments of Lower\r\nSilurian age were silica--and the invading magma was contaminated with\r\nmore and more molten sand. So basalt turned into granite. Thus Ascutney\r\nMountain in Vermont became a classic place for hot fluids squirting up\r\nand recrystallizing the under rock of New England. It made eventually,\r\nby erosion, the Connecticut River landscape.\r\n\r\nDaly became a specialist on granites, I became a specialist on lavas.\r\nWe became professors at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology.\r\n\r\nSomething new came into world geology when Wheeler, Hayden, King,\r\nPowell, Gilbert, and Dutton surveyed the Utah block fault mountains and\r\nthe Rockies. They revealed the globe with a crust of gigantic cracked\r\ndeep prisms, and an eroding surface. Davis of Harvard, the physical\r\ngeographer, was at his zenith, and from Powell’s and Gilbert’s example\r\ncame his classified river valleys. He devised systems of splendid\r\ntopographic maps and models, and demonstrations of glacier steam beds\r\nand deltas. He made surface wear and dumping debris a living thing, and\r\nthe land forms a record of it.\r\n\r\nThus I was overjoyed when, in 1893, I received the summons to go with\r\nArnold Hague to the land of geysers, colorful canyon, old volcanoes,\r\nand the source rivers of the Mississippi. My job was to take pictures\r\nwith a huge camera, but I posed as microscope man, too. I climbed the\r\nhighest peaks of the Absaroka Range, and I traveled with Hague and a\r\nmule packtrain back and forth across the range, collecting specimens.\r\nHague had been with Clarence King during the 40th Parallel Survey for\r\nthe Union Pacific railroads.\r\n\r\nHague’s field method was to climb a peak, study the view, and ponder\r\nthe visible strata, dikes, valleys, escarpments, and pinnacles for\r\nmiles around, thus formulating each problem. Then we moved camp to a\r\nnew place to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nWe sought the ancient craters. The volcanic tuffs and agglomerates\r\ncovered thousands of square miles, dating from 30 million years ago\r\nand continuing outpourings until 2 million years ago, and there were\r\nlava flows, ropy or bouldery. Here were petrified trees; there could\r\nbe found fossil leaves. The tree species told the formation ages of\r\nTertiary time. Many peaks appeared but no volcano cones. The craters\r\nhad been over what now were eroded dikes, or fissure fillings of lava,\r\nwhich stood out in crisscrossing walls. Where they clustered, ores\r\nwere found: the Sunlight, Crandall Creek, and Stinking Water mining\r\nclaims. These were the roots of lost volcanoes, lost by decay, tumble,\r\nrainfall, glaciers, and rivers. Underneath the mountainous lavas,\r\nappeared white marine limestone cliffs, and still lower appeared\r\nancient granite gneiss.\r\n\r\nThe geology of ancient seabeds, fossils, eruptions, and glaciers was\r\npainted on a whole panorama of mountains and river basins. From a\r\nmountain top silently gazing through field glasses--which he was always\r\nlosing and recovering--Hague would look around for hours. “That ledge\r\nis the Madison limestone, those are the Red Beds, those pink, rounded\r\nhills are Archean granites.”\r\n\r\nAfter a day of packtrain travel I was free to fish or hunt. It was a\r\nprivilege to hunt with Anderson, the old negro cook, whose gray beard\r\nand bushy white wool belied his keen eyes. He had been a slave, later\r\na soldier in General Custer’s Big Horn expedition, and a pioneer and\r\nhunter. His father had been massacred by Indians, and Anderson swore he\r\nwould kill any Indian on sight.\r\n\r\nOne of our hunting trips near Crandall Creek was especially memorable.\r\n“Mr. Jaggar, I smell sheep up on that shelf!”, said Anderson. And he\r\nclimbed up a pine tree growing at the bottom against the limestone\r\ncliff. He laid his Winchester rifle on top of the steep slide rock\r\nslope at the foot of the tree, muzzle upward, butt end downhill. “You\r\nmind my gun, I’ll climb out on a limb against the cliff and get on\r\nthe shelf, and yo’ all hand the gun up to me.” He reached the shelf,\r\nmade of Cambrian limestone of trilobite fame, and sitting over on it\r\nimmediately knocked down slabs of rock. They fell on the gun which\r\nstarted to slide down the slope. I grabbed for the muzzle pointed\r\ntoward my throat, the stock wiggling right and left. The gun went\r\noff and I felt a nick in my ankle. Anderson had left a cartridge in\r\nthe barrel with the hammer resting on it, but my nick was made by a\r\npebble ploughed up by the bullet. So the trilobites took a shot at me.\r\n“Well, this is natural history,” I murmured. Old Anderson was less\r\nphilosophical. He cussed me for letting the rifle kick itself far down\r\namong the trees.\r\n\r\nElk, grouse, blacktail deer, antelope, rattlesnakes, prairie dogs,\r\nskunks, badgers, owls, whistling martens, wild sheep, and the grizzlies\r\nwe never saw alive were all part of the great West. So were the bucking\r\ncayuses and kicking mules with which we lived, numerous ranchers,\r\nprospectors, soldiers, sportsmen, and guides. Once we were joined by a\r\nsheriff looking for an escaped desperado from Red Lodge Prison.\r\n\r\nJust before I left the Yellowstone, I visited the hot springs and\r\ngeysers. With more than 4,000 vents, the geyser basins are steaming\r\nareas in the forest. At Mammoth, the carbonate terraces show exquisite\r\nripples and sculptured cups in steps. One hotter group of waters,\r\nthrough the igneous lavas and granites, becomes full of silica and\r\ndeposits sinter. The other, through limestones, deposits travertine.\r\nThe alkaline siliceous waters deposit such strong silica edifices\r\nas to hold the explosive steam boilers of the geysers. Both silica\r\nand lime deposits are led to gorgeous sculpturing and to brilliant\r\ncolors at their borders caused by the blue-green algae, which live at\r\ntemperatures up to 150° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe boiling waters have been superheated volcanically since Tertiary\r\nvolcano times, when first dark magnesian, and afterwards siliceous,\r\nlavas were ejected. Here is the same order Daly and I found in Vermont;\r\nthe dark rocks first, rifting through slate, the granites last, with\r\nquartz cutting the dark rocks. The cavities among the Yellowstone\r\ngeysers show quartz.\r\n\r\nThe surprise to me was that the geyser basins were eternally breaking\r\ndown, cracking, dissolving, making new geysers in the forest. Instead\r\nof being chiefly deposition, the hot spring action is chiefly erosion.\r\nIt is a vast cycle of hot magma gases and rainwaters from Tertiary\r\ntimes to now; from 20 million years ago to now. A long time.\r\n\r\nRemember that the last retreat of the glacier-period ice was only\r\n20,000 years ago. That ice found the geyser basins in full swing. A\r\nthousand times farther back were the Yellowstone volcanoes in full\r\nactivity, and they kept going while the continent lifted and pushed\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico from the Great Plains to where it is now. And yet\r\nthat 20 million years was only a twenty-fifth of the time back to the\r\ntrilobites, and a Yellowstone seabottom bed of that age is under all\r\nthe lavas. Our schoolbook history is pretty small.\r\n\r\nIn all directions the ground of Norris Geyser Basin is cracking and\r\nchanging. The geysers are utterly unreliable, here today and mere hot\r\nsprings or empty cracks tomorrow. Old Faithful intervals range from\r\nthirty-eight to eighty-one minutes, quite irregular. The New Crater\r\nwas a squirting, scalding jet which killed the trees and vegetation\r\nall about. Its seemingly regular, twenty-five foot jets shot up at\r\nforty-five degrees inclination about every three minutes. Later, in\r\n1922, I was to find this geyser totally different. Careful studies\r\nhave shown that water of this elevation boils at 199° Fahrenheit; one\r\ngeyser gave off 253° Fahrenheit, or fifty-four degrees of superheat,\r\nseventy-two feet down its shaft. This is the only place of superheated\r\nwaters known on earth. The roaring steam of the Black Growler has\r\neighty-one degrees of superheat. The quantity of carbon, sulfur, and\r\nchlorine in the waters is so excessive, though it is very small in the\r\nrock, that a source of heat from volcanic gas is certain.\r\n\r\nThe net result is thousands of boiling springs of rainwater, soaking a\r\nsponge of rhyolite rock over hundreds of square miles, erupting over a\r\nremnant volcanic furnace beneath, and eroding and dissolving out basins\r\nat the headwaters of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nHere is an object lesson in volcanic erosion. Here is a perpetual\r\neruption of volcanic gases which has dwindled after millions of years\r\nof melting siliceous and carbonaceous rocks. It recrystallizes them\r\nas andesites, rhyolites, and obsidians, and mixes deep steam with\r\nrainwater to do the work of erosion and water solution and of deposits,\r\nover a vent at the heart of the Rocky Mountains. As usual, this vent\r\nhas cluttered itself from age to age with the melt of the deep earth\r\ncrust, namely basalt, which Yellowstone’s lavas show repeatedly from\r\nbottom to top of its accumulations. And as usual, the vents themselves\r\nare hard to recognize, buried as they are under heapings.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 I returned to the Yellowstone, where I visited Death Gulch,\r\na dismal solfataric gully with a trickle of cold, acid water near\r\nCache Creek. Accompanied by Dr. F. P. King, I climbed up this gorge,\r\nwhere there was a bad smell and burning oppression of the lungs from\r\nhydrogen sulfide. It was a V-shaped trench 50 feet deep in volcanic\r\npuddingstones, whitened with alum and epsom salts. Bubbles rose through\r\nthe water in many places.\r\n\r\nThe remains of eight big bears were found in the gorge, clustered in\r\none place. The latest victim was a young grizzly with a clot of blood\r\nstaining his nostrils from his last hemorrhage. Poison gas had killed\r\nhim. Earlier visitors had found squirrels, hares, and butterflies and\r\nother insects killed by gas. Probably both sulfuretted hydrogen and\r\ncarbonic acid gas do murder in still weather. However, we had the wind\r\nblowing up the gulch. We lit matches in hollows and carbon dioxide did\r\nnot extinguish them. The same thing had happened when Mr. Weed in 1888\r\ntested for carbon dioxide at Death Gulch.\r\n\r\nNow, knowing the case of Mr. Clive, the Englishman, and his guide,\r\nWylie, who were overwhelmed by hydrogen sulfide while photographing\r\nBoiling Lake on December 10, 1901, it looks to me as though the\r\nrotten-egg smell may play a large part in the killings at Death\r\nGulch, as well as in some poison tragedies of Java. Boiling Lake is\r\nat the south end of Dominica Island north of Martinique. There are\r\nfour solfataras and the scalding lake, the latter near the interior\r\nvillage of Laudat, at the head of a volcanic valley, and four miles\r\non horseback from Roseau, a shore town southwest. When Mr. Clive,\r\nWylie, and Matson--another native guide--looked down at the hot pool,\r\nMatson noticed it boiling without vapor, and called attention to the\r\ndanger. However, they went on to the lake. Matson later reported, “I\r\ninhaled something offensive and felt as if I was dying. I ran, and lost\r\nconsciousness. I came to in a ravine and found Wylie lying where I had\r\nleft him.” Clive, refusing to leave Wylie, sent Matson for help, but\r\nwhen rescue parties arrived, both men were dead.\r\n\r\nAt Boiling Lake there was no eruption, no vapor, only the very bad\r\nsmell. All the symptoms indicated a sudden change in the pool from\r\nsteam to excessive hydrogen sulfide. And five months later, at Pelée\r\nacross the channel from Dominica, excessive hydrogen sulfide set off\r\nthe great explosions.\r\n\r\nIn view of these phenomena it seems likely that Death Gulch in the\r\nYellowstone also kills with sulfur gas, the odor of which is so strong\r\nthere. Day and Allen associate hydrogen sulfide with the limited\r\nYellowstone sulfate areas, of small water discharged, and such is\r\nDeath Gulch. One part hydrogen sulfide in 200 parts of air is fatal to\r\nmammals, and it may come up in gushes. Carbonic acid asphyxiates, but\r\nit is not a poison and when it is free is so heavy as to mix with air\r\nvery little. Death Gulch is not a place of lime deposition like Mammoth\r\nHot Springs, where carbonated water decomposes underlying limestone.\r\n\r\nEurope was to be the next step in my education. As assistant in\r\npetrography and graduate student at Harvard, I was encouraged by\r\nWolff to plan for Heidelberg. There I was to find H. Rosenbusch, who\r\nhad put system into the infinite series of minerals in rocks. But my\r\njourney to Heidelberg began with a geography congress in London and\r\na geology congress in Zurich. These meetings were with such bigwigs\r\nas Lord Curzon, Henry M. Stanley, and famous arctic explorers, and I\r\nwas surprised to find that all these VIP’s looked like ordinary men.\r\nUnfortunately for me, this realization came a little late.\r\n\r\nLooking for a luncheon beer garden in Zurich, I picked up a small\r\nside-whiskered Englishman, and suggested we join a group of foreign\r\ngeologists in a buffet. “Oh no,” he replied, “no beer. I only want a\r\ncup of tea and a biscuit.” So I left him and crudely and youthfully\r\njoined the younger men in the beer parlor for sauerkraut and wienies\r\nand Munich beer. Later at the opening meeting, the Geological Congress\r\nwas addressed in French by the famous Sir Archibald Geikie, Director\r\nGeneral of the Geological Survey of Great Britain and Ireland, and the\r\nauthor of “The textbook of geology,” the greatest of geology manuals.\r\nHe was my pickup, whom I had deserted at lunch time. I had lost the\r\nopportunity of a lifetime, for a tête-a-tête with the world’s most\r\nfamous geologist.\r\n\r\nBefore going to Munich, Harry Gummeré of Haverford and I trekked\r\nthrough Denmark in a third class carriage amid peasants smoking\r\nfearful-smelling tobacco in long china-bowl pipes. Then we crossed to\r\nChristiansand in Norway. We traversed the fjords north to Trondhjem\r\nby rowboat, in “stoolcars” with little girl drivers. Then we traveled\r\non foot, and everywhere in rain. Waterfalls were so numerous we never\r\nwanted to hear of another one. We climbed up to Stalheim from Bergen,\r\nsaw the Jordalsknut, a magnificent half dome in a vast granite canyon\r\nlike Yosemite. We rowed around the Kaiser’s yacht in the Nordfjord,\r\nand tried to pick him out on deck. We got soaked with days of rain in\r\na backcountry village, and went to the inn, got into bed, and sent our\r\nclothing to dry in the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThe local Norwegian bank looked at our Brown Brothers letter of credit\r\nand said, “Nothing doing,” which inspired us to compose a poem:\r\n\r\n    We’re so happy we don’t know what to do.\r\n    We haven’t any clothes to wear,\r\n    We’re wet all through and through.\r\n    We haven’t any money and we ought to feel quite blue\r\n    But we don’t, we feel so happy, we don’t know what to do.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the innkeeper was amused by our poem and sympathetic\r\ntoward our plight. He took our IOU’s and told us we could have all the\r\nmoney we wanted and to send it back when we reached Trondhjem.\r\n\r\nFrom Trondhjem we crossed Scandinavia by rail to Stockholm, like Venice\r\na city of canals. Delightful maiden ladies kept the breakfast place\r\nand served us with many queer breads, goats’-milk cheese, and sublime\r\ncleanliness. The canal boat took us across Sweden to Göteborg. It was\r\na little steamer, from the porthole of which we saw a cow comfortably\r\ngrazing a few feet away. And we saw and were impressed by the superb\r\nlandscaping of lawns, by tree horticulture, and by lock masonry. In\r\nboth Norway and Sweden the people talked English, the national costumes\r\nwere delightful, the girls were pretty, and everybody was clean and\r\ndemocratic.\r\n\r\nThe winter semester of 1894–1895 was spent in Munich, where Groth’s\r\nmineral and crystal collections were the main attraction, and where I\r\nheard the lectures of Sir Doktor Privy-Councillor Knight Karl A. von\r\nZittel, author of six huge volumes on fossil shells, fossil horses,\r\nfossil dragons, and fossil trees, and a history of geology. We once saw\r\nhim rigged out in gold braid and an admiral’s fore-and-aft cocked hat\r\nfor some imperial function.\r\n\r\nHe was a forceful lecturer. The assistant arranged diagrams on the\r\nrack, the students gathered, and then his majesty entered. Everyone\r\nrose and Zittel held forth with a rattan pointer: “Es gibt, meine\r\nHerren, ein ganze anzahl von ausgezeichnete beobachten über” and so\r\nforth. Then he whacked the drawings, and made graceful allusion to\r\nAmerican investigators as he explained a giant stegosaurus.\r\n\r\nIn the “Heidelberger Geologischer Panoptikum,” as an attic room on the\r\nNeckar was called, I afterwards posted a ditty based on “Ole Uncle Ned”:\r\n\r\n    There was an Orthopod\r\n    Stegosaurus Marshii\r\n    Laid him down on his Jurassic bed.\r\n    He had a row of shovels down the middle of his back\r\n    But he didn’t have a very big head.\r\n\r\n    _Chorus_:\r\n\r\n    Hammer, hammer, hammer on the stone\r\n    Chisel, chisel, chisel on the bone\r\n    There’s no more rest for poor old Steg\r\n    For Zittel couldn’t leave him alone.\r\n\r\nHeidelberg days were memorable for the lectures of Rosenbusch,\r\nGoldschmidt, and Osann; for laboratory system; and for long collection\r\ntrips. With specimen bag and hammer, we went to Saxony, Bohemia and\r\nthe Vosges Mountains, the Black Forest, and the Oberwald. I had a\r\nlarge, pointed hammer named Umslopagaas, after Rider Haggard’s hero who\r\nwielded such a weapon. When Palache and Brock and I were in a quarry\r\nand an unwieldy boulder had to be broken, the yell arose, “Umslopagaas\r\ncome quick!” The collection of rock specimens at “classical”\r\nlocalities, meant the textbook rocks of Rosenbusch, or of Zirkel of\r\nLeipzig. Every student dreamed of having a private collection.\r\n\r\nAfter the Ascutney experience, I was impressed by Schneeberg granite\r\nin Saxony. At the border of the granite are slates, baked in zones\r\nback from the granite edge: hard horn rock, spotted rock, mica rock,\r\nthen claystone. The colored geological map of Saxony was superb. This\r\nincludes the mining district of the birthplace of geology in Europe,\r\nwhere in Freiberg, A. G. Werner had founded an arbitrary science in\r\nthe eighteenth century, imagining granites to be crystallized from a\r\nworld-wide ocean.\r\n\r\nIn one place I found a hand specimen with tiny granite tongues which\r\nhad split their way, as liquid as alcohol, between the blackened folia\r\nof slate. The granite itself was all crystals, but here was proof of\r\na fluid when the granite penetrated. What was it, how hot was it, a\r\ngas, a foam, a paste, or a liquid? The time this occurred was millions\r\nof years before Kaiser Wilhelm. I had found something similar in\r\nthe Yellowstone, the little dikes of sylvan intrusives in Absaroka\r\nMountains. The smallest tongues showed the most perfect granite in the\r\nmicroscope, of Tertiary intrusive stocks. It was as though in these\r\nsiliceous invasions of basaltic agglomerate, nature made its best\r\nexperimental granitization on a very small scale.\r\n\r\nWe soaked up the surprises of European scholarship. We pored over books\r\nin the bookshops, loaded ourselves with microscopes, goniometers, and\r\nfour-volume textbooks. We found all the science of Europe in attractive\r\nunbound form and had it bound in half morocco. Mineral dealers were\r\neverywhere, offering beautifully labeled specimens. All things in\r\nEurope seemed inexpensive.\r\n\r\nRosenbusch, who had big brown eyes and a gray beard, came to look over\r\nmy work on feldspar, in his laboratory. When I asked enthusiastically\r\nwhat make and model of German microscope I ought to buy, he turned me\r\naround and looked deep into my eyes: “Herr Jaggar,” he said, “Es is\r\nnicht das Mikroskop, es ist der Mensch.”\r\n\r\nAnother time he produced a dense black rock and said to Matteucci of\r\nVesuvius, to Palache, and to me, “You are geologists. What for a rock\r\nis that?” We, of course, got it wrong, thinking it must be a lava. It\r\nturned out to be a black limestone, easily identified, had we scratched\r\nit instead of putting our lenses on it. He chuckled at the gullibility\r\nof geologists.\r\n\r\nOsann gave a course on petrographic chemistry which met at 7\r\nA.M.! We usually got there, but once or twice the teacher\r\nhimself was late. We would gather around Osann, who was fat and genial,\r\nand say “Herr Professor, how about some sausages and beer and a little\r\nbreakfast?” He always replied “Why not? There is plenty of time,” and\r\nwe sought the nearest cafe.\r\n\r\nSome professors got up at two o’clock in the morning and wrote, taking\r\nadvantage of the quiet hours. Rosenbusch had a high desk and wrote\r\nstanding up. Their objectives were to produce enormous tomes listing\r\nall crystals and all rocks and all publications, in all languages. This\r\nis German science. Its password is “thoroughness.”\r\n\r\nThe net effect of German scholarship on me was a feeling of irksomeness\r\nand resentment, but what I learned of thoroughness and of mechanisms\r\nI value extremely. I honor the memory of those teachers, and I\r\nhonor their pupils, who by specialism have penetrated deeper and\r\ndeeper into the smaller and smaller things of matter. The ultimate\r\nis the background material between the galaxies of the universe and\r\nthe unknown background particles of life. But for me, the middle\r\nfield--the development of mountains, rivers and sea bottoms, continents\r\nand volcanoes, earthquakes and depressions of land, the sky, clouds,\r\nand waters--all the outside world, needed experimental engineers.\r\nIntermediate bigger things like the crust of the earth and moon, within\r\nthe time that is measured in human years, seemed to be neglected by\r\nscience, and yet to be accessible to the giant power of engineering.\r\n\r\nRosenbusch set me at one feldspar specimen for an entire summer. I\r\nwanted things moving, changing, and evolving. I wanted a narrative of\r\nthat tabular feldspar crystallizing, or better, a dish wherein to watch\r\nit crystallize. To me it seemed that Faraday or Pasteur would have\r\ndescribed the quality of a moving feldspar medium in pressure, heat,\r\ngas, liquid, or changing particles. The qualitative investigator would\r\nhave a furnace and make many trials and produce synthetic feldspar, and\r\nhe would write a narrative approximating what the under earth must do.\r\nHe would make melt or froth conditions successful in imitating such\r\nrocks as basalt or granite, using hot gases.\r\n\r\nThe problem of basalt and granite began to be recognized in the\r\neighteenth century. Werner guessed, and taught his pupils, that\r\nthese rocks were sea bottom deposits. A few determined Europeans\r\nin the nineteenth century--Fouqué and Michel-Lévy, Doelter, and\r\nMorozewicz--melted mineral mixtures and made igneous rocks by cooling\r\nthem. The motive was approximation; the result was good and useful.\r\nNo one reached melting by hot gases and absorption of hot gases. No\r\none made granite. Volcanic rocks were imitated approximately as to\r\ncrystals, but not as to gases. And the whole of volcanism was later\r\nproved to be gases, as is the whole of physics and astronomy and\r\nbiology. Man is largely a puff of hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThese visions were what I brought back from Europe, along with much\r\npondering of such experimenters as Daubrée, Lacroix, Stanislas\r\nMeunier, Reyer, and my teacher Goldschmidt, all brilliant imitators\r\nof the earth. Goldschmidt gave a course in blowpipe analysis which\r\nwas completely original. His methods went far beyond those of his\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, W. M. Davis had written me to come home to Harvard and give\r\nthe course in field geological surveying. This was in 1895–1896.\r\n\r\nMy teaching was devised to cut up the map of Boston. I pasted the\r\npieces in notebooks and sent out students in pairs, equipped with\r\nmap books. They were to keep pencils sharp, use a uniform system, and\r\nhammer off specimens from ledges. They were to examine the rock under\r\na magnifying glass, then name it; but I cautioned them, “If you don’t\r\nknow the rock, call it ‘FRDK, funny rock don’t know.’” Students marked\r\nthe page opposite each map with symbols for the rocks on that map. Then\r\nthey came together in seminar, and we made a colored map of the geology\r\nof Boston. Laurence La Forge, now professor at Tufts College, was my\r\nstudent and later my assistant. He published the results of our work\r\nmany years after the study was made.\r\n\r\nWhen teaching was extended into experimental geology and geology of\r\nthe United States, laboratories were set up in the basement of Agassiz\r\nMuseum and I was given carte blanche to furnish them. I equipped them\r\nwith a water tank, a gas furnace for melting and recrystallizing\r\nminerals, pressure machines, an air compressor, and motors. Students\r\nwere assigned experiments with wax, plaster, cement, sands, coal dust,\r\nand marble dust. They imitated strata, rivers, deltas, intrusions, and\r\nmountain folds, and familiarized themselves with the way solids break.\r\n\r\nEach man took a special arbeit for his final thesis, and worked by\r\nhimself with clock or metronome, thermometer or pressure gauge,\r\nspring balance or centimeter scale, and he reviewed the experiments\r\nof the past. Prominent among my students were Ralph Stone, afterwards\r\nstate geologist for Pennsylvania; Vernon Marsters of Indiana; Julius\r\nEggleston of Riverside, California; and Ernest Howe of Yale.\r\n\r\nIn the course on United States geology were such students as Amadeus\r\nGrabau who became leading paleontologist of China; Stefansson the\r\narctic explorer; Ellsworth Huntington, afterwards the distinguished\r\nYale author and geographer; and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. With so\r\nmany Roosevelts at Harvard, I quite forgot my famous student until\r\nhis first visit to Hawaii, in 1934. Mr. Roosevelt had remembered his\r\ngeology professor, though, and an aide phoned the Volcano headquarters\r\nto request that I be at Hilo when the President’s ship arrived.\r\n\r\nThe United States geology course was the product of my two seasons in\r\nthe Yellowstone and my interest in the great Hayden, King, and Powell\r\nsurveys. The youthful geologists needed to know the continent and its\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe big Washington monographs and folios have made a gallery of\r\nunderground pictures of one of the greatest continents, and these are\r\nsupplemented by the work of the Canadian geologists. America shows\r\nAppalachian folds and thrusts, fault blocks of the Utah plateaus, and\r\neruptives of the Rockies. It contains the amazing metamorphism of very\r\nrecently upheaved sea beds along the Pacific shore. It records the\r\nremnant sea bottoms and dust-storm deposits of the vast plains, bearing\r\nbeside the obvious buffalo skulls, the old bones of whales, reptiles,\r\nand rhinos.\r\n\r\nSuperposed on all this is so-called physiography, the science of\r\nfalling materials and water, the rotting of the lands, and the\r\naccumulation of debris. A net of rivers over ground and under ground is\r\nwhat stands out, and the living river pattern has changed incessantly\r\nthrough the ages. But through and over it is a moving process of the\r\nages, kinetic, alive with glaciers, hot springs, underground heat or\r\nsurface cold, soaking rains and rushing storms, earthquake and uplift,\r\nfault motions and sinkings. Everything is in motion to one who senses\r\nslow motion, occasionally breaking down resistance and charging ahead.\r\nAnd geology is a sense of slow motion and its jumps for 5 million\r\nyears, with this human year, here and now, of great importance.\r\nGeology, like humanity, is not just history.\r\n\r\nUnder all are gas and heat; Saratoga Springs, Yellowstone, the Comstock\r\nLode, and Mount Shasta. The series gets hotter from New York to\r\nCalifornia. And out at sea the refuse of the continent is dumping all\r\nday long. And science is anxiously waiting to learn how hot sea bottom\r\nis.\r\n\r\nIn addition to laboratory work, I wanted to conduct cross-country hikes\r\nfor such subjects as botany, geology, and zoology in the forests and\r\nswamps and hills of Massachusetts. And it was in connection with these\r\nplans that I learned a lesson in simplicity. I went to President Eliot,\r\nremembering the high sounding “Pierian Sodality” name for the college\r\norchestra, to get a classical calendar name for my cross-country\r\ntramps. He said, “What, in brief, is your idea?” I replied, “In\r\nordinary language they will be natural history walks.” He took a pen\r\nand said, “Why not this for a name?” On the paper was written “Natural\r\nHistory Walks.”\r\n\r\nAn important part of our curriculum was the Tuesday evening geological\r\nconference, during which any graduate worker could give a paper. To\r\nthese conferences came, at different times, Brooks, Spurr, Schrader,\r\nGoodrich, Mendenhall, P. S. Smith, Mansfield, Matthes, Lane, Crosby,\r\nBarton, Douglas Johnson, Daly, and all the Harvard staff. The men\r\ngot confidence in public speaking and exhibiting, and the professors\r\ncommented in kindly fashion. Topics ranged from summer work in the far\r\nwest and current studies in meteorology under Ward to petrographic or\r\nexperimental work with projection apparatus under Wolff and me. Jackson\r\nand Hyatt brought in fossils, and the Geological Survey was always in\r\nevidence as a goal for young men, or a subject for review. Shaler’s\r\ncomments were accompanied by a string of good stories. The conferences\r\ntaught students how to teach by making them speak in public. It was one\r\nof Shaler’s most productive inventions, and has been copied far and\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nWalcott in the Survey looked to Harvard to produce field mappers of\r\nrocks. Graduate students had the choice between process and history,\r\ngeography linked to school teaching, microscopical petrography and\r\ncrystallography linked to the minerals and rock collections, or\r\nevolution linked to museums and fossils. Beecher of Yale had found\r\nhairs on the legs of fossil trilobites. Someone else had found fossil\r\nbacteria. A group of petrographers got together and founded an\r\nartificial classification of fire-made rocks based on chemistry--no\r\nuse at all to the field man with a rock specimen. Agassiz had built a\r\nmagnificent museum. The research motive was based on collections; the\r\npublic exhibit motive was based on evolution and big, rare things.\r\nThe publication motive imitated Europe; “be as technical as possible,\r\ndetest reporters and newspapers, and never be popular.”\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Harvard University gave me a Ph.D. degree, after a double\r\nthesis and an oral examination. I passed the examination very\r\nawkwardly, as my capacity for remembering text book information is nil.\r\nMy theses were (1) on an invention, a mineral hardness instrument; and\r\n(2) on the included fragments found in Boston dikes.\r\n\r\nThe microsclerometer, as the instrument was called (that is, a\r\nmicroscope scratcher), was designed to diamond drill a mineral to a\r\nfixed depth. The hardness was measured by the time consumed, on the\r\ntheory that the energy required for the standard hole varied with the\r\ntime, and the time with the hardness. The number of rotations with a\r\nconstant speed motor is a measure of the time.\r\n\r\nThe paper was published in America and Germany, and elaborately\r\nreviewed by a microscopical society in England. The instrument was\r\nborrowed by H. C. Boynton, a graduate student in metallurgy, and he\r\ngot good results on the microscopic crystals that constitute steel.\r\nThe inventing and constructing with the aid of Sven Nelson, a Swedish\r\nmechanician of ability, were to me an education in themselves. For one\r\nthing, I learned how enthusiastically science feeds on ultra-little\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMy petrography of included quartz fragments in basalt dikes was partly\r\npublished, but made no hit at all. It was outdoor work, it concerned\r\nthe granite problem, it revealed the “fluid” of granite minerals as\r\n“waters or vapors” having no effect on augite, the green fusible\r\nmineral of basalt. But the same fluid was revealed as corroding quartz\r\ninclusions, harder and supposedly more infusible.\r\n\r\nIf temperature had anything to do with it, the granite fluid could melt\r\nholes in quartz inclusions, but the mantle of augite dark crystals\r\nwhich the basalt had plastered on the outside of the quartz fragments\r\nremained unmelted. This was my first adventure with the ancient problem\r\nof fusion, or melting. I became convinced that granite fluids, like\r\nthe makers of gold quartz veins, are low temperature vapors or gasses.\r\nThis agrees with what is now well known, that silica has a low melting\r\npoint. But melting and temperature are not the whole story.\r\n\r\nTo me, the spreading of one’s fame by scientific papers was\r\ncommercialization. “You must make your name known” and “what have\r\nyou published?” rang through the scientific halls of learning. No\r\nsuggestion of art, literature, drama, beauty, or philosophy ever came\r\nto me from my scientific colleagues. Some literary friends, like\r\nWilliam Garrott Brown and my classmate William Vaughn Moody, thought\r\nreadability important. Brown warned me against the dullness of small\r\npapers in scientific writing. Agassiz warned me against exactly the\r\nopposite, namely, against popularizing or being interesting. This\r\nantithesis between science journals and art probably never comes\r\ninto the field of vision of many young scientific writers. They see\r\nonly “Write for your scientific peers and for no one else, that is\r\nyour world.” All my life I have been plagued by “be as technical as\r\npossible” versus “tell the public what it all means.”\r\n\r\nI suspect that our system is producing diagrams and statistics in\r\ngeology (and perhaps in science generally) and no longer produces works\r\nof art. I know few geologists who are fine draftsmen. They accept\r\nphotography instead. I know none who is a literary stylist. They write\r\nfor ultra conciseness and tabulations. The nineteenth century taught\r\nclassical English and drawing.\r\n\r\nGeology is a science of the dreamland of the earth’s interior and\r\nof millennia of the ages and of the overwhelming expanse of rich,\r\nproductive, unknown ores under ocean bottoms. It is a field for men of\r\nletters, and for new Magellans, Humboldts, and Darwins bursting with\r\nimagination and the will to explore.\r\n\r\nThis seeming digression is really germane to the purport of this book.\r\nIt is one man’s review of a half century of evolving discovery. Also\r\na half century of evolving error and departure from the ways of the\r\nleaders. The leaders, from William Smith’s thoroughness with strata\r\nin England, to Clarence King’s summary of a thousand miles across the\r\nCordillera, explored upward and outward. It persuaded governments.\r\nPersuasion before the court of public opinion no longer uses and\r\nemploys explorer men of letters. The United Nations is not employing\r\nClarence Kings on the world geology of the remaining three quarters of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe confusion, the secrecy, and the loss of art are occasioned by\r\nvulgarization. In 1875 real men of distinction explored the earth.\r\nNow that is left to incorporated establishments, teaching trusts, and\r\ncalculating machines. Clarence King was a linguist and was the son of a\r\ntrader in China. His Yale training under Dana and Brush gave him real\r\nculture. His founding of the United States Geological Survey was the\r\nevolution of a genius who disliked politics and whose friends rejoiced\r\nwith him in great prose, good pictures, and fine sculpture. Then he was\r\nwrecked by a false ambition and the decadence of the very thing which\r\nmade him great, the simplicity of high thinking, noble writing, and\r\ncultivated friends. Lacking today are cultivated boys with an ambition\r\nto explore the globe, both under the sea and in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nGeology in 1897 was a jigsaw puzzle, with a choice between the museum\r\nand the field, between the easy thing of collections, fine microscopes,\r\nand the scientific societies, and the hard thing of exploring the\r\nglobe. Collections and instruments were an overpowering attraction,\r\nparticularly when photography and experiment were involved. But\r\nroughing it in the wilderness has made some of the finest characters I\r\never knew.\r\n\r\nGeological surveys of the west continued to occupy me during the\r\nsummers. I worked in the Black Hills of South Dakota under Samuel\r\nFranklin Emmons, and my associates included John Mason Boutwell, John\r\nDuer Irving, Philip Sidney Smith, Bailey Willis, and N. H. Darton.\r\nBoutwell was to become a copper geologist and copper magnate in the\r\nmines of Utah; Irving, Professor of Economic Geology at Lehigh and\r\nYale; and Smith, head of the Alaskan branch of the U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey.\r\n\r\nBeing with Emmons, Willis, and Darton in the Black Hills field was to\r\nlearn variously how geologists work in the field and how their minds\r\nwork. Emmons was of the Boston Brahmins, a Harvard man, mining geology\r\nhis specialty, with the Clarence King tradition of the Great West, the\r\n40th Parallel Survey.\r\n\r\nBailey Willis as Chief Geologist spent a week with us in camp, and I\r\nsaw his genius for drawing in line, and he explained the four-step\r\npacing method. Willis mapped distances by pacing across mountains,\r\ncounting in his head, while talking at the same time. He compiled in\r\ncolor a geologic map of the United States. His marvellous experiments\r\non mountain folding, his explorations in all the continents and his\r\npoetic faith in hydrogen and crystallization as internal forces made\r\nhis name immortal.\r\n\r\nN. H. Darton mapped the Great Plains; and his genius was for hard work,\r\nlong field hours, color photography at its very beginning, and an\r\nextraordinary eye for detail in the field.\r\n\r\nDarton showed me how to find the Chadron Formation on the divides,\r\nwhite clays easily overlooked. Darton’s many years, traversing the\r\nentire West, and publishing superb monographs of artesian waters and\r\nof immense fossil sea bottoms, summarizing the geology of whole states\r\nfrom Texas to Canada, ranks him among the great geologists. I learned\r\nfrom him detail of infinite discovery possible in every rock ledge. He\r\nfound tiny fossil shells everyone else had missed. Powell and King had\r\npainted impressionistic geology. Darton followed and painted thousands\r\nof miniatures, but also combined these into large books.\r\n\r\nCharles Doolittle Walcott was Director of the U. S. Geological Survey\r\nat that time, and no greater geologist ever lived. His Cambrian\r\nfossils, those of the first great fossil-making “Mediterranean Sea” of\r\nNorth America, lay buried in the United States from shore to shore.\r\nUnswervingly he followed every inland sea of 531 million years ago and\r\nthereafter, through advances three times across the continent. Lands\r\nwere of moderate relief and climates were mild. Marine animals and\r\nsea weeds, large and small, were abundant for 80 million years. And\r\nremember that a million years is a thousand times the interval since\r\nWilliam the Conqueror.\r\n\r\nThe continent Walcott mapped of that ancient time was the North\r\nAmerica of today, with sags that let in shallow sea strips and\r\npools where the Cambrian shales and limestones now lie. He wrote a\r\ndescription of that vast history, and all his later summers were spent\r\nin the Canadian Rockies, where fossil-bearing strata make the most\r\nstartling mountain peaks on earth.\r\n\r\nMy Black Hills surveys of 1898 and 1899 were near Deadwood and\r\nSpearfish and Mato Tepee, the Devil’s Tower National Monument. In\r\nthose badlands with weird desert gorges, appear the bones of ancient\r\nrhinoceroses and many grotesque animals, huge and tiny, of 40 to 60\r\nmillion years ago. We found little bones in white earth on the divides\r\nstill preserved against erosion.\r\n\r\nOur big job was to map the laccoliths near Deadwood. A laccolith, or\r\nrock cistern, is a lava body which in very ancient times squirted into\r\nthe cracks of the strata. The lava had penetrated between the strata of\r\nthe northern cover of the Black Hills, swelled to lenses between the\r\nstrata; and, particularly, it selected and penetrated the soft shale\r\nbeds which grow thicker and more numerous upward among the formations.\r\nThus after erosion of the present landscape, both large and small lava\r\nlenses were revealed as resistant hills, the largest toward the bottom\r\nof the pile of strata and the smallest and steepest toward the top in\r\nthick, black ancient mud deposits.\r\n\r\nMostly, the laccoliths were injections of volcanic fluid up a crack,\r\nwhich met a hard bed and bent to squeeze the paste or lava into a soft\r\nlayer. The result was an underground lava flow which ruptured the beds.\r\nApparently the first rush brought up fragments of the rocks below. This\r\nfragmentary stuff of mud and gravel was overridden by the lava, until\r\nthe latter penetrated horizontally a mile or two between strata, arched\r\nthe layers above, and solidified at the Devil’s Tower with vertical\r\ncolumns like the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis group of subterranean volcanic eruptions between strata probably\r\ncame under sea bottom at the same time that the Yellowstone upland\r\nbegan its open-air outpourings farther west. But in the Black Hills\r\nthere is no sign the laccolith lavas ever broke up to the top country.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hills, like the Rocky Mountains, were a long time rising in\r\nwaves of action, whereas the lava intrusion was a relatively short\r\nepisode of one of the latest of these spasms. However, that episode\r\nentails a long story of numerous injections. It takes us down into\r\ncrust and along through the millennia.\r\n\r\nAlways think in millions of years. It is wise also to think in millions\r\nof miles and to remember that the sun and the Milky Way are parts of\r\nthe same system as the earth. And remember that a ledge or a boulder\r\ndoesn’t worry about living 20 million or 100 million years. A skull\r\nis a boulder. That old brontotherium rhinoceros with a forked horn,\r\nstanding eight feet high and fifteen feet long, lived in the upper\r\nOligocene, when clay and volcanic ash were being deposited in the Bad\r\nLands of South Dakota. Probably vast flood plains of rivers were his\r\nhabitat, swamp reeds and leaves were his food, and floods washed his\r\nbones and buried his skull where we find them today. The country of\r\nopen glades was probably like the safari land of central Africa.\r\n\r\nBrontotherium’s skull in Chicago Natural History Museum dates from\r\nabout 30 million years ago. The bones are scattered, and few complete\r\nskeletons have been found. Man’s ancestor may have started 10 million\r\nyears ago, but the nearest approach to an ape who lived in the trees of\r\nold Bronto’s forests was an opossum. Furthermore, nothing like flint\r\ntools have been found in the rhino strata. The apes started in Europe\r\nand Asia in the next geologic period, and some fossilized monkeys have\r\nbeen found in South America. But men and monkeys are too soft. They\r\ndon’t make good fossils.\r\n\r\nThe bones we found were of turtles, in clays upheaved on the top of the\r\nBlack Hills uplift. These clays were afterwards eroded into the present\r\nvalleys, and probably were contemporaneous with the riverbed silts,\r\nwhere the rhinoceros skulls were found. So our turtles and rhinos were\r\nno doubt neighbors in 29,998,000 B.C.\r\n\r\nOur sojourn in the Black Hills was not without adventure. One evening\r\nwhen Boutwell and I were riding home to Deadwood, I dismounted and\r\njumped into the shrubs of a gully to knock a rock specimen off a ledge.\r\nFrom beneath my feet came a buz-z-z like a swarm of bees. I had jumped\r\nright on a rattlesnake and could feel his coils against my ankle, and\r\nno leggings that day. Boutwell called out, “Oh let me see him! I’ve\r\nnever seen a rattlesnake.” I made a suitable reply and, somehow, leapt\r\nclear before the snake had a chance to strike.\r\n\r\nAnother adventure concerned my gold watch, a gift from my dad on my\r\ntwenty-first birthday. I lost it from a chain which broke against\r\nthe saddle pommel at some dismounting point. I advertised for it by\r\nplacards at railway stations and, amazingly, it was returned. A\r\nSalvation Army man found the watch, badly trampled by my horse, at a\r\nback country place, brought it to me in Deadwood, and received the\r\nreward. I took it to the maker in Waltham, where it was restored; and I\r\nam wearing it fifty-four years later, converted from a hunting case to\r\na stemwinder.\r\n\r\nJohn Irving of Yale, whose father had been a mining geologist in the\r\nGreat Lakes district, was one of the most lovable companions I ever\r\ncamped and tramped with. We were together in the Black Hills, where\r\nwe hired a wagon outfit to cross the Hills to the Devil’s Tower. The\r\npersonnel was a masterpiece of improvisation. The cook was a fat boy\r\nwho told marvellous tales of adventures. Among other things, he had\r\nbeen a human ostrich in the circus, and he assured us that chewing up\r\nglass and swallowing it did no harm if you knew how. So elaborate was\r\nhis cooking that again and again we ran out of grub. Furthermore, meals\r\nwere generally late, but we knew better than to hurry the supper and\r\nhis finishing touches. When finally a meal was ready, he advanced to\r\nour tent, bowed, and called out, “Gentlemen, you will now proceed to\r\nsagastuate.”\r\n\r\nJohnston the teamster was an ambitious South Dakota high school\r\ngraduate and farm boy who wanted to learn all he could from geological\r\nsurveyors. A few years ago, in the nineteen forties, I received a\r\nletter from him in southwest Africa saying that he had been successful\r\nin placer mining for gold and diamonds and that he was writing a book\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nArizona was my fourth field of fire-made irruptions; after New England,\r\nthe Black Hills, and the Yellowstone (old, middle-aged, and young). To\r\nthe Bradshaw Mountains between Prescott and Phoenix and lying south\r\nof the Grand Canyon, I was sent with Palache to make the Bradshaw\r\nMountains folio.\r\n\r\nAt Prescott we had the rare privilege of talks with Clarence King. An\r\naged bachelor dying of tuberculosis, he was living in a cottage with\r\nan old negro servant. King was a fascinating talker and writer. He had\r\nbeen the first director of the Geological Survey and was the author\r\nof “Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada.” His great summary volume\r\nof the 40th Parallel, the survey along the Union Pacific, is one of\r\nthe classics in literature and in geology. His model, unhappily for\r\nhim, was Alexander Agassiz, who made a great fortune out of Calumet\r\nand Hecla copper. When King went into mining to make a fortune he\r\ncontracted tuberculosis. He died soon after we saw him.\r\n\r\nThe problem of what makes granite was never better illustrated than\r\nin the Bradshaws. One formation, in upright bands for miles across\r\ncountry, showed dark schist, diorite, granite, diabase, granite, light\r\nschist, quartzite, granite, gabbro, and schist again, like a succession\r\nof dikes, slabs, and veins side by side. A mountain spur, like a\r\nbookshelf with colored books on edge, is called Crooks Complex, and was\r\nnamed after Crooks Canyon. The trend was with the pinched strata but\r\nthe stuff was mostly igneous.\r\n\r\nIt was as though a mechanism of melting-up was mixed with intrusion\r\nof fluid, but what fluid? A glass? or a gas? There was no smearing,\r\nbut clean-cut dikes and schist slabs on edge. In the big granite hills\r\nthere were contact breakups with fragments of schist imprisoned in\r\ngranite, but not smeared or streaked. The impression was of millions\r\nof years and thousands of episodes, all dike-making and guided by the\r\nupright lamination or vertical structure of the ancient altered tightly\r\nfolded clay and sand strata, squeezed together by horizontal pressure.\r\n\r\nSince learning of the million-year periods taught by radioactivity, and\r\nof the many million years within a single era of geology, I have begun\r\nto wonder whether these very old formations may represent hundreds of\r\nmillennia, with granitization happening over and over again, in each\r\ngeological revolution of upheaval and mountain building above.\r\n\r\nGranitization, then, is a process of heat pressure, gases, melting,\r\nand crystal making, of which the ancient words magma or emulsion or\r\npaste give no conception. And volcanism, up through the deep crust, is\r\nthe mystery devil. May it not be nucleonics and melting of deep crust,\r\nrather than chemistry? And is not the mystery devil always hydrogen gas?\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century I visited two places which\r\nare close together and related to the Bradshaw Mountains. One was\r\nSearchlight in the southern tip of Nevada, the other was the Grand\r\nCanyon of the Colorado River.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my arrival in Searchlight. A strike of miners was\r\ngoing on, and Stanford geology students had been sent in as strike\r\nbreakers. Big Bill, the sheriff, brought the boys across the desert\r\nfrom the railway. His buckboard was in front and the Stanforders\r\nfollowed in a wagon. The strikers lined the road out from Searchlight,\r\nintent on loosing the horses. But when they saw Bill’s star and his\r\nnotched six-shooter, they dropped their hands to their sides and stood\r\nlike a row of tin soldiers, while Big Bill led the way through at a\r\ngallop, cursing them roundly.\r\n\r\nWhen I got off the train at Ivanpah, a small place with only a few\r\nhouses, I spoke to a young station agent where the ancient Wells Fargo\r\nsign hung. He told me that the Quartette Mine team would meet me soon,\r\nand shortly a cloud of dust on the desert proclaimed the vehicle which\r\ncame dashing up, a phaeton rig with two big horses. The five men inside\r\nwere armed, with rifles and pump shotguns protruding. One man pulled\r\nout a heavy leathern pouch, and another stood over it with his rifle.\r\n“Come on, Jack, lets go over to Wolf Saloon.” “No,” said Jack, “not\r\ntill I get my receipt.” The mild station man yanked out a receipt\r\nbook, filled the blank acknowledging $20,000 in bullion from the mine,\r\nthrew the pouch into an open safe, and Jack with his receipt departed,\r\nleaving the gold brick to the mystic protection of that sign, “Wells\r\nFargo and Co.” Two ablebodied bandits could easily have held up the\r\nwhole rail terminus.\r\n\r\nWhen I started for the mine, accompanied by detectives and guards, we\r\nall carried pistols in holsters strapped under our arms. En route, we\r\nspent Christmas amid the smell of sagebrush and the glorious sunset\r\nlights of a purple desert. Once more I murmured, “So this is natural\r\nhistory.”\r\n\r\nI was employed to examine the Quartette Gold Mine, and the geologic\r\nmystery of the origin of a million dollars in dirt between a level\r\n200 feet down and another at a depth of 500 feet. The million dollars\r\nwas along a crushed, slipped, so-called vein, where a fault followed\r\nthe upright bedding of just such gneisses, granite dikes, and schists\r\nas had made Crooks Complex in the Bradshaws. Where gold was richest,\r\nminerals were richest--beautiful orange-colored wulfenite, green\r\nchrysocolla, blue azurite, onyx, quartz, and calcite. Everywhere were\r\nquantities of gouge, or crushed clays, from grinding walls. Native gold\r\nparticles were distributed through all this.\r\n\r\nThe schists were filled with lava fissure fillings, and the mine\r\nwas where this pattern of bands was interrupted by a very ancient\r\ngreenstone or basalt body. Hot fluids of the volcanic period, deep\r\nunderground, had accompanied fault slipping or fracture where the ore\r\nwas, the vertical fault parallel to the upright layers and across the\r\ngreenstone contact.\r\n\r\nOre and gold particles were directly related to fracture, to the fault\r\nslipping on an upright crack of one mountain block against another,\r\nto the hot vapors depositing the mineral collection, and to renewed\r\ncrushing and sliding on the mountain blocks. This was during or\r\nfollowing some part of the volcanic period when all the cracks were\r\ninjected with andesite lavas, or what the miners call porphyry. The\r\norigin of the minerals was in lead and copper sulfides which lie deeper\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA hundred miles to the northeast is the Grand Canyon, and all around\r\nare granite mountains, just as in Arizona. These Searchlight schists\r\nare the same Algonkian ancient strata, recrystallized and granitized,\r\nthat make the inner gorge of the canyon, and are traversed up cracks\r\nby volcano-making lavas, such as dot the north bank of the canyon\r\nwith crater cones. Above in the canyon are the horizontal strata from\r\nCambrian up to the Coal Measures and beyond. The vast maze of castles\r\nand turrets is a net of branch valleys of the Colorado, trenching\r\nthrough these old seabed deposits.\r\n\r\nIncluding Searchlight ore, the whole history going backward is top\r\ncountry desert, deep trench, strata piled in rivers and sea bottoms for\r\n500 million years, and lastly faulting and cracking that squirted steam\r\nand made gold minerals over and over again during the last 100 million\r\nyears. There were at least a dozen revolutions that lifted and lowered\r\nmountain ranges and continents for 2,000 million years, and the remains\r\nof iron-eating bacteria and of seaweeds and other living things that\r\ngo back for 1,500 million years. Through it all are granite injections\r\nas a process, as a mystery, going over the whole range of years in\r\ndifferent ages, and meaning what?\r\n\r\nOne of the puzzles of Grand Canyon, Bradshaw Mountains, and\r\nSearchlight--if not also of New England, the Black Hills, and the\r\nYellowstone--is faulting. A fault is what a geologist means by a crack\r\ndown deep where the country rock has dropped down on one side so as to\r\nmake a discordance across country. Earthquake faults make a visible\r\nbank or step or sidewise slip, changing the surface after an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThe northwestern states are partly mapped as fault block mountains. The\r\nisland of Hawaii has a series of fault step blocks southeast, slipping\r\ntoward the ocean. The steep east face of the Sierra Nevada is a fault\r\nfracture.\r\n\r\nProfessor Shaler once stopped me on the street and said of my field\r\nwork, “Jaggar, you don’t teach faulting enough.” Faults were shown\r\nalong straight lines on the color maps of formation in the old Boston\r\nbooks, and were located by guesswork if glacier deposits covered up\r\nthe ledges. It seemed to me that faults ought to be proved or else\r\nomitted from the maps. Probably I too was wrong, for faults or cracks\r\ncompletely concealed by soil and strata are tremendous unknown lines on\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nThe Searchlight ore body is certainly a fault fracture, and so are\r\nthose of Tonopah and hundreds of mines. It was digging that proved it.\r\nThe cracking and slipping and steaming and mud-making on the fissure\r\nare what brought up the minerals.\r\n\r\nA question arises as to how much the Grand Canyon itself and its\r\ntributaries are guided by fault fractures under valleys. My impression\r\nwas in 1901, and it still is, that “Jaggar ought to teach faulting”\r\nmore than he then did.\r\n\r\nThe primitive ocean blocks of earth crust sank, while continents\r\nremained high, leaving the earth crust a mosaic of blocks large and\r\nsmall, high and low. Between the blocks spout the volcanoes. I have\r\nnever agreed with C. E. Dutton that volcanic heat energy could come\r\nfrom shallow pockets under those fault blocks. Even he acknowledged the\r\nweakness of the argument. If the earth crust broke up and the blocks\r\nvariously sank in the core matter, leaving continents as a complex\r\nof high blocks, then the blocks are deep and are still moving. The\r\nmovements are in years, year-thousands and year-millions. Volcanism up\r\nthe cracks releases core energy. So does much of fault movement, namely\r\nearthquakes. And these facts geologists do not appreciate.\r\n\r\nSo we get faulted river courses and fault cracks up which came fluids\r\nthat transformed sediments of rivers, lakes, deserts, and seas into\r\ngranite, felsite, and greenstone. These are the ancient names. There\r\nare hundreds of other, geology names. But geology produced no Faraday.\r\n\r\nI disliked geology in 1902. And I disliked mining because of its\r\nsecrecy and its devotion to profits. Geology failed to tell businessmen\r\nthe mystery of granite, of felsite, and of greenstone. Astronomers told\r\nthe same men of mysteries, and they were fascinated. Physiology led\r\nthem to cells, plants, animals, and chemicals in the blood, solving\r\nmystery after mystery. Men, money, inventions, engineers, buildings,\r\nand staffs grew by leaps and bounds in those sciences. The best geology\r\ncould do was guesswork--a mastodon, a big reptile skeleton, a guesswork\r\ncolor map--while seventy percent of the earth was seabottom rock,\r\nunmapped, and twenty percent more consisted of fractures covered with\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nSeeing the Carnegie and Rockefeller laboratories and observatories, I\r\ngrieved for field geology. The public did not even know that granite,\r\nthe mystery, is the commonest rock and that quartz, the gold maker, is\r\nthe commonest mineral. Nor did they know that both are almost absent\r\nfrom the whole Pacific. Nor that geology is almost ignorant of their\r\norigin and injection, if it is injection. Here was the globe, the\r\nend product of astronomy, the most fascinating research in the whole\r\nrange of science. The source of all raw materials of commerce, yet its\r\nfire-made rocks and its seabottom rocks remained a mystery.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Grand Canyon, let me record my impressions of the\r\nerosion. It is a gorge a mile deep usually described as “cut” by the\r\nColorado River. As I shall show in discussion of experiments with the\r\nGrand Canyon model, it is possible, in stratified layers yielding grit\r\nto flowing rainwater, to cut a deep canyon by surface runoff. It is\r\npossible for underground water and tributaries from side rainfalls\r\nto increase the volume of such a stream greatly in a hundred miles.\r\nBut Dutton’s showing of upheaved and downdropped big blocks of broken\r\nmountains, and such obvious breaks as the Tonto and Bright Angel faults\r\nshown to tourists as traced out by Bright Angel Canyon, prove that the\r\nearth crust is broken. And Searchlight showed a fault to be a water\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nThe enormous canyon appeared to me to be a million-year break system\r\nof earth-crust rotting. The water is a giant modern grinding mill of\r\nrainfall, underground accumulation, and transport. But with five great\r\nerosion surfaces shown in the discordances, from 2,000 million years\r\nago to the present day; and with upheaval of the high plateaus in block\r\nfaults, and bent strata age after age; and farther north with recent\r\nvolcanoes that spouted up the cracks, it seems more vivid to think\r\nthe valleys at least partly water-filled cracks and chasms. Volcanoes\r\ncannot be shallow. The canyons and the great bend are different from\r\nthe Green River source, because of upward push in waves. The up-push\r\nof the Uinta Mountains is well known to have been slow. It kept pace\r\nwith the ruptures followed by the river. Going back to Daubrée, rivers\r\nfollow cracks much more than do the textbooks.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 two things happened which affected the rest of my life. First,\r\nDirector Walcott asked me to furnish estimates for a Hawaii geologic\r\nsurvey, a request which eventually led me to Hawaii. Second, the\r\nYakutat Bay earthquake snapped on an astonished world, though most of\r\nthe world didn’t know it.\r\n\r\nThe Yakutat Bay earthquakes in Alaska, in September 1899, were\r\naccompanied by the pushing up of the bedrock shoreline by forty-seven\r\nfeet. Lowered beneath the sea were whole forests, on glacial deposits\r\npulled down by submarine landslips. It was an uninhabited region at\r\nthe foot of Mount St. Elias, along a fjord penetrating far into the\r\nmountains. It came in line with the Aleutian trench, under the Pacific,\r\n4,000 fathoms deep. The earthquakes lasted two weeks.\r\n\r\nThis colossal movement of blocks of the earth’s crust hundreds of miles\r\nacross gave one the impression that we knew little of what was going\r\non. Remembering that seventy-two percent of the earth’s surface is\r\ncovered by oceans and that less than ten percent is really inhabited, I\r\nawoke to how much there was to learn. If whole forests and their roots\r\ncould float away into the Pacific currents, with all their plants and\r\nanimals and seeds and bacteria, what might not have occurred in past\r\nages, when such jostling of crust blocks was common.\r\n\r\nBut before I was to experiment with live volcanoes came a decade of\r\nlaboratory experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                         Imitating Ripplemarks\r\n\r\n                 “_The Constitution is an experiment,\r\n                    as all life is an experiment._”\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the century my experiments with the sclerometer, and with\r\nthe class in experimental geology, steered me for years into laboratory\r\nexperiment. Europe was headed toward geophysics and geochemistry,\r\nmeaning chiefly mathematical and statistical analysis. My vision was\r\nnonmathematical, though I used pressures, temperatures, clocks, and\r\nyardsticks to measure erosion, sediment, warping of strata, and melting.\r\n\r\nThis took me away from petrography, for the polarizing microscope was\r\ndealing with infinite series of minerals and molecules. I could see\r\nnothing but infinite penetration into the smaller and smaller. Clarence\r\nKing and Frank Perret had been on the way to infinite journeying\r\noutward to the bigger and bigger.\r\n\r\nThe guiding formula was “erosion, sedimentation, deformation, and\r\neruption.” Measure these on the globe, imitate them with mud pies\r\nin the laboratory. Compare the global examples with the mud pies.\r\nTry to get the mud pies to illuminate the gigantic stream systems,\r\nflood plains, sea bottoms, folded mountains, intrusions, and lavas\r\nof the earth. Then try to measure in the field those processes with\r\nobservatories. So, to me, came the transition from collections to\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nThe machinery of nature, whether with sand heaps or sand grains or\r\ncoral pebbles, is the same. It is impelled by currents flowing over\r\nloose materials which make eddies in the lee of lumps. The eddies\r\nare either billows or cyclones. At the middle they are billows; at\r\nthe ends they are cyclones. The billow eddies obstruct the heaping.\r\nThe cyclone eddies lengthen the heaps right and left of the current\r\ndirection. George Darwin studied the eddies by means of a drop of thick\r\nink in a glass tank on top of a ripple ridgelet. The ink migrated to\r\nform underwater billows and cyclones, or vortexes. He used a dropper\r\nto place the ink globule, and then watched the vortexes form as he\r\noscillated the tank.\r\n\r\nLow parts travel fastest, namely the points. High parts build on the\r\nupstream side, and travel slowest, and the stuff tumbles over the crest\r\nline and is corniced by the eddy. Snow does it, pebbles under sea do\r\nit, and marine life adapts itself to it, wherever the food supply is\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nIn the study of ripplemarks, Harry Gummeré, a graduate in astronomy,\r\nwas my collaborator. Ripplemarks are made by back-and-forth eddies on\r\nthe bottom, while big waves oscillate the water. We moved the bottom\r\ninstead of making waves in the water. A glass plate sprinkled with sand\r\nunder water in a tank was oscillated back and forth horizontally. It\r\nwas clamped under a carriage which oscillated on wire tracks stretched\r\nacross the tank. A string pulled the carriage against an elastic on\r\nthe other side. A wooden wheel and crank, set upright edgeways, had\r\nholes and pegs to pull on the string, and the crank turns were timed\r\nwith a metronome. The holes in the flat wheel were a centimeter apart,\r\nso that a revolution of the wheel pulled the string for every two\r\ncentimeters of travel of the carriage. Thus the sand-covered plate was\r\njerked back and forth under water two centimeters, four centimeters,\r\nsix centimeters, and so forth; once a second, or two seconds, or three\r\nseconds, and so forth, by beats of the metronome.\r\n\r\nThe result was beautiful ripplemarks on a glass which could be lifted\r\nout of the water, dried, and placed over blueprint paper to preserve\r\nthe record. The sizes of ridge to ridge ripples were from a fraction of\r\nan inch to two or more inches. The little ones diminished to zero when\r\nthe jerking was small, the big ones washed out when the jerking was too\r\nbig.\r\n\r\nThe blueprints showed that both length and speed of strokes (amplitude\r\nand acceleration of motion) made the ripples increase in size, and\r\nsomewhere between the largest and smallest sand ripples was the optimum\r\nperfection of ripple form. The blueprints look like mackerel skies.\r\nAnd mackerel-sky clouds are billows of condensation between an upper\r\ncold stream of air and a lower moist one. In between are the same\r\nback-and-forth billows of vortex as in our sand.\r\n\r\nAt a geological conference at Harvard I showed blueprints made directly\r\nfrom glass plates covered with artificial ripplemarks. At the same time\r\nI exhibited rock slabs of fossil ripplemarks and photographs of others\r\nshaped like horseshoes. These were variants of the rippledrift process\r\nseen on sandy beds of running streams. I also showed photographs of\r\nswash marks running along the upper steep slopes of beaches. And of the\r\nwind-formed rippledrift of dry sand dunes. From the deserts of Peru\r\ncome photographs of _medaños_, or crescent dunes, hills of sand\r\ntapering to curved points at both ends. The points are downwind, the\r\nhigh horseshoe toe of the hill is upwind, and like a coral atoll the\r\nedifice is current-formed.\r\n\r\nRipplemarks can form in hundreds of fathoms of ocean water if the storm\r\nwaves on the surface of the sea are big enough. A particle of water on\r\nthe crest of a wave is lifted up and down in a long vertical ellipse.\r\nA particle deep down under the wave is lifted fore and aft in a long\r\nhorizontal ellipse. Under a three-hundred-foot length of wave in the\r\nEnglish Channel in deep water the bottom particles of water are shoving\r\nsand back and forth, and making packed ripplemarks.\r\n\r\nA big sand grain becomes a lump for small sand grains to bump against.\r\nThey make a heap which piles up and lengthens out. The heaps merge and\r\nwe get a tightly packed and ridged sandy bottom. Each ridge has an eddy\r\nfirst on one side, then on the other, as the water particles reverse in\r\ndirection. Oscillation builds first flocculence, then alignment, then\r\neven spacing. The opposite sides of a ridge have equal slopes.\r\n\r\nRippledrift is made by a current in one direction. It is usually not so\r\nregular or in such straight ridges as ripplemarks. If a stream of water\r\nis jetted over sand round and round in a ringshaped tank, ridges will\r\nmigrate along the bottom, but they are smeary. The regular ripples in\r\ndry sand on dunes have flatter slopes upwind, steep scarps downwind.\r\nThey are regular, probably because wind blowing is intermittent and\r\nback currents occur. So they become more like ripplemarks.\r\n\r\nOn the bottoms of water streams, the horseshoe rippledrift requires\r\na nice adjustment of lumps and side points migrating downstream. All\r\nrippling requires a sand of mixed sizes of grains. If they were all\r\nalike they would not ripple, for the larger grains have to obstruct the\r\nsmaller ones in order to produce the ripple pattern. Rippledrifting\r\nas a whole is a building mechanism. Mixed with wave currents which\r\nmove beaches along, including beach pebbles, it can be compounded\r\ninto building oceanic islands. The crescent dunes of the desert are\r\ndependent on the prevailing winds being loaded with a sand supply at a\r\nwindward erosion source.\r\n\r\nOceanic currents depend on the winds, like the trades in the tropics,\r\nand an obstructing bank or shoal adds surf action to the streaming. If\r\ncorallines and _Tridacna_ clams and crabs add organic cements, a\r\nhorseshoe hill is built on the sea bottom. Big eddies will do the same\r\nkind of work as little eddies. This phenomenon extends all the way\r\nfrom the galaxies of stars with their beautiful spirals, to the spiral\r\neddies in molten lava rushing down a pit crater, or to the streaming of\r\nprotoplasm in a plant.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle, the great botanist, studied rippledrift in order to try to\r\nsolve the most abstruse problem in all biology, the unsolved mystery of\r\ncell division. At some critical point a budding cell decides to form\r\na partition and divide in two. Why or how? De Candolle thought that\r\nthe protoplasm granules circulating around the cell walls might start\r\nregular lumps on those walls, and so build rippledrifts and make eddies.\r\n\r\nThus a current and an eddy and mathematics might start many of the\r\ndoubles, triples, hexagons, and stars of the world of shells and living\r\ntissues. And the cells could pile up in symmetry in the submicroscopic\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe erosion of the earth’s surface reveals symmetries. River maps look\r\nlike trees with branches and with rivulets as twigs. Other symmetry is\r\nin the horizontal plane of the ocean, where headland furnishes pebbles\r\nand the sand sweeps into pure curves of beach and bar and cusp. So a\r\ndelta builds into a lake of leaf shape and annual layers are added as\r\nthe flood seasons come.\r\n\r\nSome of the fingerlike drainage of erosion cuts into plowed lands\r\nduring a rainy spell. This suggests what might be done with a spray, a\r\nmud bank, and a tank, to see how the finger valleys form. This erosion\r\nof the runoff of water was imitated in the Harvard laboratory.\r\n\r\nA beautiful river pattern on a slope, like the trickle of raindrops on\r\na windshield, was made by tipping up a rectangular glass plate covered\r\nwith very liquid clay. A portion clung to the glass, and exquisite\r\nfernlike streams formed on the upper half of the plate, with a bank of\r\ndistributaries of V-shape on the lower slope.\r\n\r\nThis glass plate was used for a surface of stamp mill slimes, of\r\nthicker beds, and was eroded with an atomizer and water by means of a\r\nbarbershop air compressor. The slimes are very fine pounded sands with\r\nangular fragments. To get a stream pattern, this is necessary, so as\r\nto have fine grit to cut down the rivulets between the coarse grit\r\nremnants. This resembles the requirements for ripples.\r\n\r\nThe spray was kept going for hours. Meanwhile the river pattern at the\r\nsteep sides of the sloping plate ate into the bank of sediment, robbing\r\nthe streams of the main slope, because the side streams were oblique\r\ncascades. They dug deep, took off the water, and left the main slope\r\nstreams without their headwater drainage. The pattern of the main slope\r\nbecame the headwater branches of the side streams, the streams which in\r\nplan drained over the edge of the uplifted plate right and left. This\r\nwas somewhat like stream robbery.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Lewis River at the south end of Yellowstone Park\r\nonce drained Yellowstone Lake, including the Lamar River, which is\r\nnow the headwaters of Yellowstone River. The Yellowstone plateau\r\nformerly drained south into the Snake River and the Pacific Ocean.\r\nThe Yellowstone River headwaters suddenly tapped the system, thanks\r\nto geyser erosion and acid corrosion, and the Yellowstone Canyon cut\r\ndown rapidly, reversing to the north the outlet of Yellowstone Lake.\r\nThereafter the lake flowed into the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nAt some critical time about the glacial period the continental divide\r\nmade a leap of thirty miles from the present head of the Canyon to the\r\nneighborhood of Lewis Lake, or from one end of Yellowstone Lake to the\r\nother. This is stream robbery.\r\n\r\nSpray and runoff and rainfall and wash did not alone cut down the\r\nYellowstone Canyon. The essentials were the rotting of rock and the\r\npull of gravitation on the fragments. The Yellowstone rotted away on\r\nthe north side, but it was hard granite and mountain-built quartzites\r\non the south, toward the Tetons. Hot spring rotting, geyser erosion,\r\nacid waters, and sulfur decomposed the north country. The underground\r\nwater head followed the easiest channels, and the canyon was the\r\nresult. The canyon line encircles Mount Washburn, the old volcano, and\r\nconceivably is over an old crack concentric to the dome.\r\n\r\nWater is a transporter, and cracking opens ways to the rotting agents.\r\nOnly in rivulets and floods does water actually corrade, or grind, the\r\nbottoms of streams. In our spray and fern patterns there is analogy to\r\nrainfall springs on flat strata, but nine-tenths of the elements of\r\nerosion are left out: jointing, weathering, ice, faulting, gravitation,\r\nrotting down, quaking, solution, sliding, and last, spring water.\r\n\r\nErosion by sliding continues by wind action in desert mountains, and\r\non volcanic cones under bombardment, and by rocks snapping under chill\r\nand sunshine on the moon. Creep of loose stuff is the greatest eroder\r\non earth. Rainfall cloudbursts certainly help, especially where soil is\r\nnot held together by a mat of roots.\r\n\r\nThe process of erosion is supposedly slow, as all geological processes\r\nare slow, if we neglect the possibility of such submarine landslips\r\nor supramarine upheavals as occurred at Yakutat in 1899. But even\r\nNew England has floods, hurricanes, landslides, forest fires, and\r\ncloudbursts which are exclamation points on an otherwise sleepy\r\nhistory. And in the past it has had ice sheets, and subsidences beneath\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the making of valleys and stream patterns for the\r\nmap is accented occasionally, and the occasions may come in climatal\r\nwaves unknown to us. The stream patterns in the Bad Lands, Tennessee,\r\nPennsylvania, the Grand Canyon, and New England make very different\r\nmaps. The rotting of the rock, limestone caverns, rainfall, faults, and\r\nsloping underground strata bearing spring water all influence these\r\nmaps. What is erosion and what index is written on the land to say the\r\nGrand Canyon and tributaries are being carved downward faster than the\r\nMystic River in Boston?\r\n\r\nRalph Stone tackled the Mystic River, and marked ledges and set stakes\r\nopposite the flood plain meanders. The idea was that ledges split by\r\nwinter freezes, and that the meanders of a stream build on one side\r\nand cut on the other. Maps were made repeatedly, and the ledge cracks\r\nwere measured in millimeters. Some movement was found, but a college\r\nyear was not enough time. If we could combine as a motion picture,\r\nphotographs from the air taken once a year for many years, doubtless\r\nthe film would show that the stream meander pattern is migrating toward\r\nthe sea like a wiggling snake.\r\n\r\nStone next made a model three inches thick in a tank of water, by\r\nsedimenting sixty-one very thin layers of marble dust, coal dust,\r\nclay, red lead, and sand. He tipped it up as an island and sprayed it\r\nin periods which lasted one to ninety-two hours, up to a total of 719\r\nhours. A forking stream and its delta were formed in the lagoon of\r\nthe tank. The stream cut a canyon with waterfalls, treelike branches,\r\nesplanades, and a flood plain. There were three principal hard white\r\nmultiple strata layers in the model, separated by sand. The white\r\nlayers made waterfalls and were eaten back to form the canyons.\r\n\r\nWhen the cross section of the delta was sliced with a knife, it showed\r\nthree white layers foreset at thirty degrees under the tank pool\r\nand separated by more sandy strata. The bottommost of these was the\r\nsediment of the top thick marble dust layer of the model as first\r\neroded by the spray, and the top frontal layer of the leaf-shaped delta\r\nwas the product of the erosion of the canyon bottom on the lowest of\r\nthe white layers. This must happen in nature where one formation in\r\nreverse order is derived by river erosion undermining a stratified\r\nolder pile of sediments.\r\n\r\nWe called this the Grand Canyon model, and it showed many features\r\nsimilar to those of South Dakota Bad Lands and the Colorado River\r\ndrainage. It was strictly rainfall erosion and stratification soakage\r\nand seepage. The model surface sloped ten degrees, the high divide\r\nat the top had a backslope of forty-five degrees, and everything was\r\nsprayed for two months with special hose nozzles, making during part of\r\neach day a mistlike rainfall.\r\n\r\nThe steep backslope did not trench itself at all despite its steepness.\r\nThis slope, on the contrary, absorbed moisture and carried the rainfall\r\nunderground down the dip of the strata to add spring water to the main\r\nstreams. The backslope was a “steep escarpment,” supposed in physical\r\ngeography to migrate by trenching backward, but the rills never gained\r\nvolume enough to cut into it. All the water volume acquired its grit\r\nfor cutting from the large surfaces, which were gradually tilted in the\r\ndirection of the rivers.\r\n\r\nWhen the complete series of experiments on erosion and sediment\r\nwas published, it showed that the treelike branching of rivers is\r\ndependent on underground water surfaces; that meanders on a flood plain\r\nare partly a bubbling-up process of flood-plain soakage; that when\r\nside tributaries form by undermining, the upstream branches cut off\r\nunderground water from the downstream branches; and that when a country\r\nis tilted in one direction, there is a tendency to parallel streams,\r\nseparated by intervals controlled by underground water areas reached by\r\nthe undermining tracery of headwater springs.\r\n\r\nThis arborescence in a spray model is a regular and delicate\r\nadjustment, where a bunch of tributaries is not mere catchment of\r\nrainfall, but is the product of sheet flood in belts of underground\r\nwater related to the tilt of the country. Arborescence of river\r\ndrainage on a surface of flat strata, like the coastal plain of the\r\nsoutheastern United States, is a rhythmical pattern of exquisite\r\ndesign capable of reproduction and study in the laboratory. It is a\r\nmathematical forking and headward development dependent on volume\r\nof water, undermining impermeable strata along permeable ones. And\r\nafter the “tree” map is formed, the bulb of branches and twigs and\r\nunderground leaves of spring water holds all the downslope country in\r\nits “shadow,” so that no new rivers can form there. This is what makes\r\nour great maps of river systems. It is not haphazard. It is a vast\r\nocean of underground water, with mountains of water and valleys of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA great lake marks an underground soakage water level. A riverbed marks\r\nan underground seepage topography. The sea of water inside a continent\r\nis just as much a map of hills and dales of water as the land is a\r\nmap of the hills and valleys of geography. The water is dynamic, it\r\nis flowing. The land surface is dynamic and rain fed; it is creeping\r\nsoils. Together, groundwater and rivers are melting down the landscape\r\nas a living thing. Man dams the water and uses the power of the erosion\r\nmelting down the land.\r\n\r\nWhen we went to Haystack Basin north of the Yellowstone Park, we found\r\nthat all of the mountains surrounding it were audibly crumbling.\r\nUltimately, the continent is all one thing: a falling body of rotten\r\nrock, ice, water, sand, boulders, and soils, self carved into valleys\r\nand mountains, always tumbling. And down below are the fault blocks,\r\nprisms of earth shell over the white hot core. And that also is\r\neternally in motion, irrupting, earthquaking, lifting, falling,\r\nscraping, heating, cooling in waves through the ages. Man is very tiny,\r\nbut if he listens he can hear the earth’s heartbeats.\r\n\r\nAt hot springs the water mantle meets the hot earth shell. So the\r\ngeyser basins of Yellowstone, California, New Zealand, and Iceland are\r\na hot part of the great erosion system of groundwater. This brings us\r\nto the next group of experiments, the making of artificial geysers.\r\n\r\nGeysers as eroders show that the under earth is hot and is invaded by\r\nrainwater. In exceptional volcanic places the water is boiling hot. The\r\nFirehole River of the Yellowstone is carving down basins of solution\r\nfaster than the regular geysers are building up siliceous sinter. Here\r\nis boiling-spring erosion by solution. It may be called the extreme\r\nthermal aspect of ordinary spring-water erosion. How does spring water\r\nerode? By bubbling up under the beds of rivers. The bubbling out of\r\nsprings starts rivers, and flood rainfall starts soil gullies; land\r\nsculpture is the result.\r\n\r\nWe introduce geyser experiments here because boiling springs make drama\r\nout of ordinary springs, just as active volcanoes make drama out of\r\nburied volcanoes. Ordinary springs and buried lavas intruding invisibly\r\nare much more important and extensive than geysers and volcanoes. Most\r\npeople never think of a spring as one of millions bubbling up the beds\r\nof brooks and rivers and sea bottoms.\r\n\r\nMost people never think of volcanoes erupting--properly speaking,\r\nirrupting or inrupting--under Kansas or Brazil. Nobody denies those\r\nplaces are hot underground, but it all seems remote. Yet every spring\r\nis thermal if there is heat escaping through the rocks around it.\r\n\r\nGeyser basins lower the country around them and leave hills in relief.\r\nThe proportions of basins and hills depend upon the runoff of rotting\r\nand dissolving rock. The shape of a hill standing high, what Davis\r\ncalled a monadnock in New England, depends on its whole history, not\r\non its hardness. Ascutney Mountain stands high as a lump because\r\nsurrounding slates have rotted down. Mount Monadnock may stand high\r\nbecause the springs under the river pattern of cracks neglected it in\r\nthe rotting and crunching of a continent.\r\n\r\nDynamic weight eternally falling makes low places. Hardness against\r\nweathering makes a mountain high only as a relic or residual. It is\r\na node in the gigantic process of gravitation rotting and the spring\r\nsquirting of groundwater. The water heats, rises, dissolves, siphons,\r\nsprings up, and transports dirt. Underneath is a definitely heated\r\nearth crust.\r\n\r\nAccordance of summit levels of mountains and hills as one looks across\r\ncountry does not have to represent an upraised plane surface. There\r\nis more undermining where the spring squirting is most voluminous.\r\nWhen spring squirting is equal, the opposed slopes of a valley adjust\r\nthemselves. The tree line, the snow line, the rain line, and the wind\r\nline are definite levels of erosion. Under it all the rotting rock is\r\nfalling toward the earth’s center, slowly, creakingly. The everlasting\r\nhills are not everlasting, they are everfalling; rocks, boulders,\r\nslopes, waters, gravels, sands, and muds. And adjustment to the\r\natmosphere and groundwater surface is irresistible.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _1. Experimental Geology Laboratory, Harvard\r\n  University, 1900_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _2. Fountain at edge of lava lake, May 17,\r\n  1917_]\r\n\r\nThe notion of erosion pulling down hills to a flat plane near sea level\r\nis fascinating to geometry-minded people, but not to the mechanically\r\nminded. A flat plane near sea level in the Mississippi delta is\r\nwhere the river has swung right and left against valley walls, over\r\nits own flood plain. A flat plain, secured by ice sheets or planed off\r\nby encroaching wave action as land sinks is mechanically probable. In\r\nthese circumstances we look for river or ice or wave-beach deposits.\r\nBut an “almost plane” occasioned by the multiple action called erosion\r\ndown to base level is to me the delightful dream of map students. If\r\na landscape has been planed off, a machine router or planer did it.\r\nThe great rivers of China have had a long time to bang back and forth\r\nagainst their confining boxes of rock and on top of their own mud.\r\n\r\nTo return to geyser-spring experiments, I built a simple quart flask\r\nsurmounted by a four-foot glass tube. At the top the tube rose through\r\na cork in the bottom of a two-foot pan. In the side of the cork of the\r\nflask was a second tube with a hose leading up to a reservoir bottle of\r\nwater. The reservoir bottle could be raised or lowered. If the water in\r\nit was level with the pan, there was hydrostatic equilibrium: the pan\r\na pool, the bottle a source, the flask and tube full. When we applied\r\nheat to the bottom of the flask, the water boiled, the pan overflowed,\r\nand some cold water from the bottle chilled the flask. The pan had\r\nbecome a boiling spring.\r\n\r\nNext we lowered the reservoir bottle. The reduced head of water\r\npermitted no overflow at the pan, and steam bubbles accumulated in the\r\nfour-foot upright tube. The boiling point was controlled by four feet\r\nof water pressure. If the bubble lift reduced this to three feet, there\r\nwas a lower boiling point, the pressure was reduced by overflow above,\r\nand the whole flaskful boiled. The geyser tube became a regular geyser\r\nat intervals of a minute and a half, with eruptions enduring twenty\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThis was a miniature of Old Faithful in the Yellowstone. Old Faithful\r\nis bigger, its intervals average sixty-five minutes, and they range\r\nfrom thirty-one to eighty-one minutes. It jets up 150 feet for a period\r\nof four minutes. It throws out 3,000 barrels of water at each eruption.\r\nOur little machine threw up about a pint to a height of four feet.\r\n\r\nWe hear much about soaping geysers as an artificial stimulus. The\r\napparatus in our laboratory showed the effect of soap right away. When\r\nsome soap was put in the pan, the intervals of a minute and a half\r\nshortened to one minute. Soapsuds accumulated in the tube and depressed\r\nthe water to the neck of the flask. The multiple bubbles, film against\r\nfilm, made the water system viscous. The myriads of tiny steam bubbles\r\nformed so fast that they shortened the lifting time for the column.\r\nIf the height of the reservoir bottle was so adjusted that the geyser\r\ndidn’t quite know whether it was a geyser or a boiling spring, the soap\r\nmade the decision, and the thing went off with a bang.\r\n\r\nThis simple group of experiments makes springs very real. The\r\nYellowstone explosive springs differ from other springs in having\r\nsuperheated steam from live lavas to heat them. The rock is cracked and\r\nthe water is doing a job of solution and deposition. It deposits stout\r\ntough silica around some openings and builds them up against the head\r\nof groundwater, and they become geysers. It deposits lime dissolved off\r\nunderlying limestone at Mammoth, and this makes sculptured terraces\r\nbut not explosive springs because the temperatures are not so hot. In\r\nboth lime and silica regions, blue-green algae, which love hot water,\r\ndecoratively sculpture the pools.\r\n\r\nLike a magician I exhibited the artificial geysers before New York\r\nand Boston science academies, and gave the summaries of the results\r\nof our geyser experiments, as follows: (1) Boiling springs are like\r\nother springs, controlled by the head or pressure of underground water\r\nin the hills. (2) Upstreaming of heated water and building up of\r\nsilica (convection is the scientific jargon) may push the vent of a\r\nboiling spring even higher than its source (reversed head). (3) In this\r\ndelicate condition, even rainfall or sinter building up or outburst\r\nat a lower level or clogging of a pipe may change spring to geyser or\r\ngeyser to spring. There are many more boiling springs than there are\r\ngeysers, and many more hot springs than there are boiling springs, and\r\nthe word cold means nothing at all. There may be boiling springs under\r\nNew York City if you go deep enough. That is why the riot of geyser\r\napparatus is worth thinking about. (4) Irregular geysers overflow\r\ncontinually, regular geysers discharge their waters only during\r\neruptions. Both are methods of feeding rivers, just like any other\r\nsprings. But there is a lot of volcanic heat underground.\r\n\r\nThis brings up the question of how much a volcanic eruption is like\r\na geyser. Geologists apply a glib word, phreatic, to Japan’s Bandai\r\nVolcano, which blew steam and rocks out of the side of a mountain and\r\ndammed a river. Hawaiian volcanoes squirt liquid basalt up a crack\r\nwith flames and red fume and sulfur gas, and almost no steam at all.\r\nThe answer seems to be that the Palisades of the Hudson may once have\r\nbeen Hawaiian lava eruptions and, further, that lava is still erupting\r\nthere if you go down deep enough. New York doesn’t know about it, but\r\nit sensed it in 1886, when it felt the Charleston earthquake.\r\n\r\nAll that Catskill water supply of the great city is in cracks above the\r\nlevel of the deep lava, and extends out under Long Island Sound. If the\r\nHudson fault fissure wiggled a little more than usual, and if the deep\r\nlava lowered and pulled down some of the Atlantic water, an eruption\r\nlike Bandai is not impossible in the Watchung Ridge of New Jersey.\r\nThis is not likely; but the globe has been through revolutions and\r\ncataclysms, and the Watchung explosions might start a new geyser basin.\r\nSomething like that happened in northwest Wyoming in the Pliocene\r\nage, during 11 million years, next preceding the ice ages that began\r\n2 million years ago. And the Yellowstone was the result. We shall see\r\nmore volcano geysers.\r\n\r\nNext, the making of deltas became a hobby in our laboratory, in\r\nconnection with the old leaf deltas scattered on the New England\r\nlandscape, partly covered with trees within the grounds of the country\r\nvillas about Boston.\r\n\r\nDelta deposits extend upstream, within the mould of the cavern within\r\nice of the glacial period. Thus the map shows a snake-like ridge of\r\ngravel, ending in a maple-leaf flat, with lobate frontal slopes. These\r\nslopes were much steeper where the dump of the stream on the delta fell\r\nover the beach line at the lagoon or lake level in which the delta was\r\nbuilt. This was like the delta shown in Stone’s erosion model.\r\n\r\nStone prospected the idea of torrential deltas in a tank, while E. W.\r\nDorsey and I started a tank imitation of the glacial sand delta. In the\r\nglacier, the ice tunnel had been supplied with water by melting through\r\nthe ice crevasses, just like tunnels seen in Switzerland, floored with\r\nsand ground up by the ice. There was thus a torrent pouring along\r\ninside an arched tunnel, the mouth of which emerged on a delta in a\r\npool, with water surface either at the tunnel level or above it against\r\nthe rounded front of the ice mass.\r\n\r\nIn imitation of a rounded bank of ice with a pool of water in front\r\nand with a subglacial meandering cave fed with sands and a torrent,\r\nan apparatus was built and supplied by a hose. A sheet of lead was\r\nbent in the form of the glacier surface, with an arched opening, and\r\nset in our tank. This fitted over a tunnel of sheet iron, soldered\r\nso as to meander in plan, and fitted at its upper end with pipe and\r\nhose connection. A sheet-iron funnel rose from the upper end of this\r\nartificial cavern, wherewith to supply different colored sands to the\r\nmodel subglacial river, represented by the hose jet and iron tunnel.\r\nThe iron tunnel ended flush with the leaden arch.\r\n\r\nThe object of the experiments was, first, to set the leaden glacier\r\nin a pool of water in the laboratory tank. Next, to jet water through\r\nthe tunnel, supply sediment in successive colors through the funnel,\r\nand let that accumulate on the bottom of the tunnel and in a delta\r\nin front of the artificial leaden glacier. The deltas and their\r\nsliced cross sections in different experiments represented the noted\r\ndifference of kinds of sand supply or difference in water level of the\r\npool. In one case the water level was below the ceiling of the tunnel\r\nwhere it emerged from the arch entrance. In another, it was above the\r\ncavern mouth, so that water of the cavern stream, debouching from the\r\nsubmerged cavern mouth in the lagoon, spurted up with its mud and made\r\na half crater against the glacier front.\r\n\r\nThese experiments illuminate the gravel-quarry sections of\r\nMassachusetts. In those cuts in eskers (serpent ridges) and sand plains\r\n(glacial delta fans) were seen topset beds, or flood wash, or foreset\r\nbeds at forty-five degrees which are the sublagoon frontal wash, and\r\noccasionally backset beds where cavern wash gushed upward.\r\n\r\nSo our cross sections, cut with a knife in the delta, and the winding\r\ncake extending upstream in the cavern showed topset, foreset, and\r\nbackset strata after draining the tank and lifting out the apparatus.\r\nFrom the embryo delta the flood-plain beds overlap the earlier frontal,\r\nor foreset, beds. The frontal beds are always under the lagoon. The\r\nflood-plain beds (topset) were made by a meandering river course under\r\nthe air. Always this plain is built at beach level as a wash fan shaped\r\nlike a leaf, with the cavern stream bottom as the stem of the leaf.\r\n\r\nNew England has been covered with mountainous ice, miles high.\r\nSubglacial streams and subglacial clear ice caverns are abundantly\r\nfound at the lower ends of all glaciers in the world. They merely\r\nrepresent the melting snow and ice in pulses of sunshine, snow at the\r\nsource, ice in the course, crevasses and gravitation making water seep\r\nthrough. This water shapes a channel for itself and erodes a sewer\r\nsystem of scouring along the bottom of the subglacial valley. This\r\ngrinds and melts the bottom ice into arched caverns; and the sediment\r\nbuilds up on the stream bottoms, eventually carving the roofs of the\r\ncaverns into high arches or arcades. The subglacial caverns are self\r\nconstructed drainage pipes.\r\n\r\nThe glacial stream is really a river flood cutting its valley. The ice\r\nriver grinds and scrapes, and the water under the ice pipes and drains\r\nthe melting. The ice carries chisels of broken rock. The enormous\r\nweight, in gliding plane layers of ice, flows in accordance with the\r\ncrystal laws of snowflakes and ice crystals. The moraines, or debris\r\nfields, at the sides and on top and underneath the eroding ice jumble\r\nyield mud and sand and boulders. The torrent underneath removes the\r\nrubbish.\r\n\r\nThe delta in front follows laws of sedimentation. If there is no lake\r\nin front, the delta is a flat wash fan, or valley flood plain. All\r\nthese things become clear to the student who makes a baby glacier out\r\nof tinware, sand, a tank, a hose, and a faucet.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of cataclysms, or what early geologists called\r\ncatastrophe, happening occasionally in the world of erosion and\r\nsubterranean geysers. Such were the Yakutat crash and the Bandaisan\r\nexplosion. But each glacier-period field, like an ice mountain over\r\nEurope and America, constituted a cataclysm lasting 500,000 years,\r\nand this happened four times even in the centuries of early man. The\r\nMediterranean and the Great Lakes are offspring of such cataclysms.\r\nBut Lyell carried the doctrine of uniformity to extremes; he thought\r\nthat what man sees is what always happens. I do not believe Lyell ever\r\nrealized that earth or sun might conceivably explode in a month of our\r\ntime. Again, this is not likely.\r\n\r\nThe opposite of uniformitarianism is occasional catastrophic trigger.\r\nThe process of erosion pulls the trigger for sudden deformation. Slow\r\ndeformation pulls a trigger for eruption. Eruption triggers internal\r\nintrusions. The Frank Landslip; the Charleston, San Francisco, and\r\nNapier earthquakes; the Pelée eruption; and the Yakutat upheaval all\r\ncreated terrific surprises for geologists.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic intrusions through millions of years from the core of the\r\nearth, made of white hot star matter, percolating to surface volcano\r\nbelts up 1,800 miles of permanent, primitive cracks, are mostly\r\nbalanced by the crustal weight. This is the adjusting globe. But the\r\nintrusive mechanism, under tides in the rock and in the oceans, always\r\nin motion, pulls the trigger for the big geologic revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe very deep broken earth blocks shift, volcanism between them heats\r\nthe surface, floods the surface with gas foam, and lifts areas of\r\nsurface by heat swellings; and on the surface, what was a glacial\r\nperiod gives place to a volcanic period. The last of these was the\r\nMiocene Tertiary, with large-scale volcanic eruptions all over the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nComparing Boston with the Black Hills showed underground eruptions in\r\nthe latter, for which a warping uplift pulled the trigger. These were\r\nthe rock cisterns or lenses of porphyry injected among the strata. The\r\ntime of this was Miocene or Eocene Tertiary, probably later than most\r\nof the volcanoes of the Yellowstone, farther west.\r\n\r\nBoston, on the other hand, was making black basaltic dikes, probably\r\nidentical with the volcanoes of the Berkshire Hills and New Haven, of\r\nthe age of the big reptiles, 150 million years before the Black Hills\r\ninjections. The trigger which pulled off the Boston eruptions was the\r\nAppalachian warping. That which fired off the Black Hills was the\r\nLaramie revolution that pushed up the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe injection of lava lenses in the Black Hills was a form of\r\ndeformation of strata which we experimented with in the laboratory. The\r\nlayers of sandstone, limestone, and old ocean muds covering over the\r\narch of these hills were injected by dikes or fissure fillings from\r\nbelow. How would injections behave?\r\n\r\nWith Ernest Howe as my associate, I arranged a square tank for\r\nsedimenting sand, plaster powder, coal dust, or marble dust in layers\r\nunder water. Under it was an iron cylinder in which wax could be\r\nmelted. A screw piston pushed the molten wax up to inclined or upright\r\nslots in the middle of the tank box. The water was drained off, and\r\nthe hot wax was injected up into the strata. The tank sides were taken\r\ndown, and hardened lenses of wax were sliced vertically with a hot\r\nknife to show what had happened to the strata by the process of wax\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\nIn some of the experiments 300 pounds of shot were piled over a cloth\r\nlayer on top of the strata to imitate the weight of natural sediments.\r\nThis was before injection of the hot wax, and the result was a neat\r\ndome of deformed layers at the surface, a domical hill over a lens of\r\nwax inside. This hill was eroded with a spray of water to show what\r\nkind of radial valleys would form. Such radial streams were found in\r\nSouth Dakota, with infacing escarpments, around some of the dome hills\r\nmade by laccoliths.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning it appeared that a lens of injection would form,\r\nthat the strata would arch over a dome of wax. The arched strata\r\nstretched on the crest and the breaks gaped upward, while the side\r\nbends cracked gaping downward. It was there that the wax could break\r\nits way upward and make a volcano. Some nice little experimental\r\nvolcanoes of wax-built cones and craters formed on top of the model.\r\n\r\nAs with all folded strata arched downward under weight, the cracks\r\non the bend of a downward arch, or syncline, admit lava from below,\r\nwhereas the cracks on the upward arch, or anticline, are held tight,\r\nclosed by the weight of strata above. Thus an intrusive dome will not\r\nerupt through its crest, but through its sides.\r\n\r\nThe results of all these tests showed that rigid beds carried the\r\narching force and that soft beds were most invaded and pushed aside by\r\nthe wax. The steepness of curvature of arch varied with the load. An\r\ninclined pipe formed an irregular lens thickest away from the incline.\r\nIn a hard bed ruptured on a downbend, concentric fractures around a\r\ndome let the lava up to higher strata.\r\n\r\nOn the crest of a hard bed the fractures are like the spokes of a\r\nwheel, but they do not make dikes; they yawn open upward. Liquid wax\r\ntended to spread as a thin sheet in soft layers of strata, stiffer wax\r\ntended to arch up in a steeper dome. Rapid injection made a higher and\r\nsmaller dome than slow injection.\r\n\r\nCompared with the arching up the whole long mountain oval of the entire\r\nBlack Hills dome, with granite on the crest, this intrusion of wax\r\nonly imitates the small domes of lava intrusion or injection, where\r\nthe injection carries the energy or stress. Indeed, in nature, even\r\nthe lava lenses are influenced by the buckling that is going on in the\r\nstrata under stresses of crust warping. For the warping crust of the\r\nearth is always pulling the trigger and straining the strata. The lava\r\nrising from below seeks out the weak places and assists the buckling,\r\nas well as following the most incoherent mud or shale beds.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the big oval of the whole Black Hills uplift--swollen\r\nup like the Rocky Mountains during millions of years and within which\r\nthe lava injections were only an item--we are dealing with a push from\r\nbelow or an expansion that swelled up the pre-Cambrian ancient rocks as\r\nwell as the later granites. Such swellings were doubtless made again\r\nand again in Massachusetts. There, also, we find lavas and granites and\r\nRed Beds and glacial boulders, older than the Appalachian Mountains,\r\nas well as younger. The younger Triassic lavas are definitely erupted\r\nbetween fault blocks.\r\n\r\nAll that our experiments showed was what melted stuff will do in\r\nstrata under weight, when the force of melted stuff overcomes that\r\npressure to find a place for itself, although the weight may be more\r\nor less lifted by big arching that is taking place on a big scale. The\r\narching is bigger than the hydraulic or gas pressure squirting.\r\n\r\nThere is another possibility besides buckling. This is faulting, or\r\nmovement of deep crust blocks the boundaries of which do not appear.\r\nThe deep crust is a movable mosaic above the core, and this movement\r\nrenews itself, now here, now there. Dutton shows that we may think of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains this way all the way out to the Pacific coast. We\r\nmay have the core fluids sucking down the blocks, the volcanic fluids\r\npushing up the local strata. And the volcanic fluids in cracks are the\r\ndegenerate gassy top remnants of the core fluids which man has never\r\nseen and which are 1,800 miles down.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the crust blocks do not appear because the whole\r\nfirst shell of the globe is buried under lavas and intrusions and\r\ncrystals and mud, meaning by mud, countless dumpings of lakes and\r\nrivers and seas through 3,000 million years. Such is the kind of\r\nthinking started by making wax injections.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the experiments that whether we are imitating\r\nunderground heat with a Bunsen burner to start a geyser, or overground\r\ncold with delta apparatus to simulate a glacier, we are dealing with\r\nerosion of the earth’s surface. Erosion started with the first attack\r\non lava by the atmosphere or by sea water. Never was the pristine\r\nlava anything like the magma inside the globe; it snapped and chilled\r\nand oxidized. Whether we call it basalt or obsidian, it degenerated.\r\nMoreover, it degenerated in the outer crust when it loosed its gases,\r\nheated itself and the rock wall, found groundwater and free air, and\r\nstarted oxidation new to it. Thermal action is just as much concerned\r\nwith erosion as is rainfall or snow. Therefore, whether injecting\r\nwax and swelling strata or imitating geysers and ripplemarks, we\r\nwere experimenting with volcanoes, for the crust of the earth is\r\nfundamentally volcanic. For the purposes of this book these facts\r\ndemand reiteration.\r\n\r\nIn what are called geosynclines, or earth sags, the great beds of\r\nstrata are accumulated. They are the dirt washed from highlands into\r\nmidland seas. They are strata of sandstone, mudstone, or limestone;\r\nthin films in comparison with the fire-made earth crust. It was\r\nthe wrinkling of basin fills by expansion or end push that built\r\nHimalaya and Appalachia. The mountains are etched out of foldings and\r\noverthrusts and faults by rotting and water transport. Pressing the\r\nstrata endways to wrinkle them is called mountain building, much better\r\nnamed strata wrinkling. The thickest of them reached twelve miles\r\nvertically, but what is that to the earth’s crust of 1,800 miles? The\r\ncrust lifts and lowers fault blocks. The little strata basins expand\r\nwith heat on their bottoms and get pulled and pushed by underground\r\nlava intrusions. Also they get squeezed by global contraction between\r\ncrust blocks, and shoved up and down by the agelong wobbles. The\r\nbiggest wobble was the downdrop of the great oceans over fault blocks\r\nwhen the crust first cracked and settled over the core. Those oceans\r\nhave shifted and adjusted in waves of global action ever since. The\r\ncrust has kept the earth a sphere while lavas erupted and weighted down\r\nthe blocks. This block wobble extends into the innermost continents.\r\nEruptions up the cracks migrated from the continental seas to the\r\nshores of the present oceans. They changed composition as they did so,\r\nbecause they changed from under-air eruptions to under-sea eruptions,\r\nfifteen pounds pressure to 600 atmospheres pressure. From erosion\r\neruptions with enormous heat, to deep sea eruptions with enormous\r\nchilling and pressure. And the latter are the volcanoes of the present\r\nday, mostly concealed except for the islands and sea borders.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the crust blocks continue to wobble up and down, and quakes\r\ncontinue to creak under the rock tides of sun and moon pulls. The\r\ncreaks and wobbles are our big earthquakes, tidal waves, and eruptions.\r\nSuch big accumulations of eruptions as the Cordillera or the Hawaiian\r\nRidge is a terrific weight in a few million years. Both heaps have been\r\nat it since Miocene time, or for about 18 million years, banging down\r\nthrough the crust blocks on top of the core. Whether such balancing\r\nof heavy weights on top of the crust blocks is due to change of lava\r\nweights or sediment basins, six to twelve miles of rock vertically, the\r\ndown squeeze and underflow is called by the Greek word isostasy. It\r\nmeans standing level and is a poor word because the earth’s crust never\r\nstands still. The blocks are eternally adjusting and creaking over a\r\nfluid core, the globe is whirling, the sun and moon are pulling, the\r\nvolcanoes are erupting, and the solar system is shooting through space.\r\nTerra firma is never static. And our little atmospheric lives on top of\r\nit never stand still. We are hot, and we ourselves do a great deal of\r\neroding.\r\n\r\nThis oration is introduction to the next series of Harvard experiments,\r\nwhich dealt with squeezing and wrinkling strata in imitation of the\r\nfolds and faults of the Appalachian Mountains. Bailey Willis, at the\r\nGeological Survey, made a press of wax models of strata. A heavy oak\r\npiston was advanced by a screw crank. The models were waxes mixed with\r\nplaster for hard strata and waxes mixed with Venice turpentine for soft\r\nstrata. They were cast to imitate actual successions of hard, thick\r\nlimestones; less hard sandstones; soft mudstones; or slates. The piston\r\nadvanced at a measured rate against one end of the model, the other\r\nend being a fixed box, the strata lying horizontally. The elongate\r\nAppalachian basin had a continent (the piston) to the east; a wide flat\r\nfill of limestones or sea bottom to the west (the box); and the deepest\r\ntrough of pebbles, sands, and muds on the east, toward the rivers of\r\nthe eroding continent of that ancient time. The heavy limestone tapered\r\nfrom the west into these thinner beds and made a stiff rib in their\r\nmidst. The final result of their wrinkling was linear folds with axes\r\nnorth and south parallel to the trough, and close set at the east.\r\nThe folds overturned toward the west, the overturns developing into\r\noverthrust fractures westward when the beds ruptured. Also, the folds\r\nbecame bigger, flatter, and wider apart westward under the deeper sea,\r\nthe famous one being the Cincinnati arch.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in the middle eastern states is that the trough bottom\r\nsank as the heavy shore sediments were dumped by rivers into the sea.\r\nThe west-central states received a wide flat of limestone. Uplift of\r\nthe continent shallowed the ocean and pushed it, narrower, over to the\r\ngreat plains. So there were left a deep trough of weak beds, a massive\r\nlimestone, and an overlap of continental wash across the uplifted later\r\ncontinent of the present time. The problems to be studied in Willis’\r\nmodels were how folding would affect such a pile, what transmitted the\r\nwrinkling force, what started a single fold, and how soft and hard\r\nstrata behaved under horizontal pressure.\r\n\r\nHe found that hard, thick layers of limestone transmitted the push\r\nfarthest. That soft beds piled up on each other near the piston. That\r\nthese beds showed beautiful overthrust faults inclined away from the\r\npiston. And that the start of individual folds was favored by very\r\nsmall initial bends in a transmitting layer. These downbends away from\r\nthe continent would be made as the trough bottom sank through the ages.\r\nThe nature of this sinking in upright slices of the bottom rock is\r\nprobably downfaulting. Each vertical slice would make a step-bend as it\r\nsank.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of Willis’ box did not admit of down motion by underflow,\r\nnor did the piston pressure create an opposed horizontal force that\r\nmight have come from the ocean area. In restraining up motion over the\r\nfolds that formed, Willis piled bags of shot on top of the model to\r\nrepresent downweighting. The folding in the Appalachians was down at\r\nthe bottom of the heap where things were hot and compressed, and heat\r\ncould extend individual strata.\r\n\r\nIn our pressure chest we extended the Willis conception. We made two\r\npistons at opposite ends of an oaken box, with thick plate glass\r\npanes at one side, so as to watch the folding. The two pistons would\r\ndistribute the end pressure better and admit the possibility that all\r\nthe pressure did not come from the continent. The bottom under the\r\nmodel was an inner box that could move down, hung on heavy spring\r\nbalances. These could be screwed up to a pressure upward to compensate\r\nthe load of shot. Thus the first fold could arch downward as well as\r\nupward. This imitated a possible lowered trough bottom. The piston rate\r\nof advance was controlled by metronome, one man at each screw.\r\n\r\nFor examples, models E, F, and G had four white and four black layers,\r\nall alike in substance, at fast, medium, and slow rates. The quickest\r\nwas shortened one inch in five minutes. The slowest was one inch in\r\nan hour and three-quarters. The quick-squeeze model flexed smoothly,\r\nall folds seemed to flow, and the model held together compactly. The\r\nslow-squeeze model shortened the same amount, cracked in many places,\r\nwas brittle, and did not hold together compactly. This appeared to\r\nprove that slow motion will fracture where quicker motion will hold\r\nstrata intact, under otherwise identical conditions of substance, of\r\nfolding and shortening, and of vertical confinement.\r\n\r\nWe verified Willis’ conclusions that stiff and thick beds transmit the\r\npressure farthest and that overthrust tends to form in soft beds, which\r\nthicken near a piston. In one model we got overthrusts in opposite\r\ndirections on opposite sides of the model along a single-fold axis,\r\nwith a twist in between. While an experiment was in progress, the chest\r\ncreaked occasionally, the equivalent of an earthquake. One model was\r\ncast to represent overlap of strata near shore, like a coastal plain.\r\nWhen squeezed, it made a group of overthrusts away from the piston\r\nacting as shore rock.\r\n\r\nIn burial of strata there is a possibility whereby they wrinkle,\r\nand wrinkle most in one direction, which piston pressure does not\r\nimitate. That is the heating by burial and expansion or lengthening\r\nof controlling layers. In a long basin like the Appalachians, the\r\nwrinkling under expansion across the greatest length is easiest,\r\nbecause the axis of stiffness is parallel to the long trough.\r\nTransitions off the coastal line from one sediment to the next--sand\r\nto mud, mud to lime--will be weaknesses to start bends when expansion\r\npressure takes place under burial along the layers separately heated.\r\nThese bends develop into wrinkles and the wrinkles, into propagated\r\nfolds, with the axis parallel to the initial change of weaknesses.\r\nExpansion lengthwise on folds, once begun, may make long flat arches\r\npitching in one direction. This heating by burial distributes the\r\nfolding better and farther than pushing abutments, and makes initial\r\nbends. All bottom strata heat and expand in all directions. The\r\ndirection of easiest yielding to a folding impulse is across the weak\r\ntransition belts. After that the motion is taken up by linear folds and\r\nfractures in one direction.\r\n\r\nThe models, after continuous or intermittent squeezing, were removed\r\nfrom the chest and sliced with a hot wire for sectioning and\r\nphotographing. In one, brittle, broken series of folds in a hard layer,\r\nthe model was taken apart on that layer and the surface photographed.\r\nThe crest of the folds showed jointing or regular cracks. One set\r\nparalleled the fold axes as would be expected; the other set crossed\r\nthe slopes diagonally and in curves. These last indicated the strains\r\nof a twisting nature on a single layer between a downfold and an upfold.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the end thrust, or piston push, in nature? According to the\r\nold idea, it was contraction of the inner earth by loss of heat. Willis\r\nwrote that the basin sank, isostasy or deep flow was at right angles to\r\nthe length of the basin, and general contraction took effect by reason\r\nof the deep flow. The deep flow was toward the lighter continent, from\r\nwhich the sands were originally lost.\r\n\r\nThe recent notion that radioactivity heat is in the outer shell denies\r\ncontraction of the inner earth. Furthermore, I do not believe in a\r\nshallow underlayer of lava fifty or less miles down and capable of\r\nflowing horizontally under shifting weight. I do believe in a deep\r\nunderlayer of fluid 1,800 miles down, under a block-faulted crust.\r\nThis fluid core adjusted itself to the ocean-bottom blocks originally,\r\nmaking the upright slices moving-down controllers of the Appalachian\r\nbasin. There is no proof that sediment weight did it. It is more likely\r\nthat igneous, or fire-made, lava, as the thick outer armor plate of\r\nthe globe erupted in acts of intrusion, lubricated the vertical slices.\r\nIntrusions are under every sedimentary mountain range on earth. It is\r\nmore likely that an agelong up of ridge fault blocks and a down of the\r\nbasin fault blocks decided where the central continental basin should\r\nbe, all of it well within the permanent side ridges of North America.\r\nFor this was a continental mediterranean sea, and the warping of its\r\nhighland of Philadelphia and its basin of Cincinnati was a mere episode\r\nin the 2,000 million year history of Atlantic and Pacific borders of\r\nthe continent. The sinking of the intracontinental sea, relative to\r\nthe staying up of the highlands, was a wave in the history of globe\r\nand core. Erosion and deposition were results, not causes. They were\r\nresults of the volcanic history of the ever moving active mosaic of the\r\nglobe. The permanent North America remained high, relative to Atlantic\r\nand Pacific deeps.\r\n\r\nThe folding of the sediments merges into intrusions of magma in the\r\nsouthern Appalachians. Here arose the granite problem on a tremendous\r\nscale, which is repeated in our Ascutney Mountain in Vermont. What\r\nit was doing under the bottom of those vast fields of limestone from\r\nOhio to Illinois we have no idea. No more do we know what is doing\r\nunder the vast fields of lime and red ooze at the present bottoms of\r\nthe deep oceans. But we do know that fire-made rock squirts up under\r\nall sea-laid sediments which anyone has ever studied on islands or\r\ncontinents. This fire-made rock, solidified, has thickness and a\r\nbottom. We do not know its thickness nor its bottom. We do know that\r\nunder it are big cracks 2,000 miles long rupturing it into volcano\r\nsystems. The conclusion is that the globe is mantled by a layer of\r\nigneous matter which has spouted up cracks since more than 3,000\r\nmillion years ago. How did this matter migrate by new intrusions,\r\nto pull, push, heat, and wrinkle through 500 million years the dirt\r\naccumulated in shallow Appalachian trenches from Alabama to Indiana? We\r\ndo not know.\r\n\r\nThe last of the Harvard experiments that I took part in concerned\r\nmelting up powders of basaltic minerals and rocks, letting them cool\r\ndown gradually, and then sectioning them for the polarizing microscope\r\nto see how they resembled lavas. V. F. Marsters of the University of\r\nIndiana helped me. Based on the European work of Doelter, Fouqué,\r\nMichel-Lévy, and others, we used a French furnace with gas flame\r\nblast and small crucibles of diatomaceous earth mixed with clay. The\r\nspecimen powders of crushed natural basalts, or mixtures of pyroxene,\r\nfeldspar and olivine, were kept glowing for forty to 150 hours, and\r\ncooled either rapidly or slowly. The belief in those days was that slow\r\ncooling was the main control of coarse crystallization. Quick or slow\r\ncooling certainly does produce these effects in lava flows.\r\n\r\nFrom quick cooling, we generally got radial bunches of crystals or\r\nspherulites, in a glassy groundmass. From slow cooling, we got diabase\r\nstructure or coarser crystallization, with some openwork hollow\r\ncrystals. And there were little grains of magnetite and spinel. Much\r\ntime was wasted on furnace safety and methods, and on fire-punctured\r\ncrucibles of platinum, carbon, and graphite.\r\n\r\nNothing had been learned in 1900 about stirring, nor about gas as an\r\ningredient in basalt. It was not until years later, at the Hawaiian\r\nVolcano Observatory, that Emerson proved that aa lava was made by\r\nstirring a crucible. Aa is crystalline. Emerson got glassy lava by\r\nquiet melting. No one has yet subjected lava to hydrogen blasts like\r\nthose of a Bessemer furnace, nor to other gases. There is a big field\r\nhere for imitating Mauna Loa and Etna fountains, and for critical\r\npetrography of artificial basalts. Modern work has been concerned with\r\nphysical chemistry of limited mineral systems. So far as I know, no one\r\nhas mathematically synthesized natural rocks as an object in natural\r\nhistory since the work of Carl Barus for the U. S. Geological Survey in\r\nthe nineties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                           Expedition Decade\r\n\r\n                      “_The voice of thy thunder\r\n                        was in the whirlwind._”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas small scale experiments in the laboratory helped me to think\r\nabout the details of nature’s experiments, there remained the need to\r\nmeasure nature itself. The deep lavas of South Dakota, squeezing among\r\nshale beds, posed many questions. What penetrating of strata goes on\r\nunder Vesuvius? Does lava inrush tilt or lift the ground? Does this\r\nmeasure up to eruptions in or from craters? Cannot experiments with\r\ncraters themselves be made by dwelling there? Certainly the progress of\r\nlavas can be measured as they flow forth.\r\n\r\nThe decade following my mud-pie experiments saw me assistant\r\nprofessor at Harvard and head professor of the geological department\r\nat Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These appointments were\r\nunder Presidents Eliot, Pritchett, and Maclaurin. From 1901 to 1910 I\r\ncontinued to serve the Geological Survey, writing up back reports. Then\r\nnature took a hand. Along came earthquakes and eruptions in Guatemala,\r\na terrific disaster in the West Indies, expeditions to the Caribbees,\r\nItaly, the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Hawaii, and Central America,\r\nanother in north Japan, and disastrous earthquakes at San Francisco,\r\nValparaiso, Messina, and Costa Rica. The destruction of St. Pierre in\r\nMartinique set the stage for field work on volcanoes and earthquakes,\r\nwork which I was to continue for a half century.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening papers of May 8, 1902, announced the sudden\r\nannihilation of 26,000 people that morning at 8 o’clock at St. Pierre,\r\nMartinique, I went immediately to President Eliot. Knowing that I had\r\nbeen urging field study of volcanoes, he agreed that I ought to go\r\nto St. Pierre and wired Secretary of the Navy, William H. Moody, to\r\narrange for transportation. Immediate financial support came to me\r\nfrom Alexander Agassiz, the National Geographic Society, and numerous\r\nfriends; and my Harvard colleagues agreed to give my lectures.\r\n\r\nI reported to the training ship _Dixie_ in Brooklyn, where I found\r\nCaptain Robert Berry, a stalwart Virginian, in command of a cadet\r\ncrew. On board were I. C. Russell of Michigan, author of “Volcanoes\r\nof North America”; E. O. Hovey of the American Museum; Curtis, the\r\nmaker of topographic models; R. T. Hill of the Geological Survey, and\r\nexpert on Caribbean lands; and numerous other scientists, and newspaper\r\ncorrespondents.\r\n\r\nThe voyage to the West Indies was unique. On the navy cruiser were\r\nstores of food, tents, clothing, and medical supplies for the refugees\r\nand an oddly assorted passenger list; all assembled because of warfare\r\nagainst mankind by two utterly unknown volcanoes, Soufrière on the\r\nBritish island of St. Vincent, and Pelée at the north end of the French\r\ncolony of Martinique. Geologists gave lectures to the crew on deck; and\r\nin turn, we learned about naval discipline and efficiency.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at Fort de France, thirteen days after the terrific\r\ndisaster, we were transported at once to St. Pierre on the naval tug\r\n_Potomac_. We landed and walked through the ruined sugar city, the\r\nstreets puddled with molasses and rum. Thousands of dead were buried\r\nunderfoot amid the rubble, for the day before our visit, there had\r\nbeen a second blast from Pelée, the 4,000 foot volcano smoking four\r\nmiles away. This had thrown down what roofs remained after the first\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nWe arrived opposite St. Pierre May 21, 1902, and saw a smoking, dusty\r\nline of ruins along the shore. Before we landed we were warned that if\r\nthe tug’s whistle should blow we were to make for the boats. The dusty\r\nhill lay on our left like a gray snow landscape, not at all like a\r\ncone. The crater was a gorge in an ordinary mountain under clouds.\r\n\r\nWe wandered through the dreary ruin and found masonry completely\r\ndestroyed and no visible large volcanic fragments. The streets were\r\nfull of rubble, and everything was coated with green-gray powder. Roofs\r\nwere gone, an occasional timber was burning, and bodies were still\r\nnumerous in the shells of houses. We saw a baby in an iron cradle, a\r\nman face down in a tank, and a big man on his back in a deep baker’s\r\noven. His flesh was shriveled and drawn away from his joints by heat.\r\nElsewhere eight or ten bodies were crowded at the foot of a cliff.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _3. Explosion cloud rising from Halemaumau\r\n  during explosive eruption, May 13, 1924_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _4. Crag in lava lake, January 23, 1918_]\r\n\r\nThe end of the town toward the volcano, all backed by cliffs, was\r\ndeeply buried under gravel, but the southern end had a covering of only\r\na foot or two of sand. The second explosion was greater than the first\r\none, demolishing third storeys and the second belfry of the cathedral.\r\nThe beautiful bells “whose soft liquid notes used to ring across the\r\nbay with touching cadence at the Angelus hour” lay tumbled in rubbish,\r\nsplinters, and steaming vapors; their ancient embossed inscriptions\r\nhalf buried in dust.\r\n\r\nThe bodies were mostly shriveled to a crisp from the second eruption,\r\nfor earlier the bodies had not been much altered. The odor was a\r\nhaunting one that returned in dreams--of foundry, steam, sulfur\r\nmatches, and burnt stuff, and every now and then a whiff of roast,\r\ndecayed flesh that was horrible. It was impossible to realize that this\r\nPompeii had been a thriving French town two weeks before. Not a roof\r\nwas left, and scarcely a timber; steam came through little holes in the\r\nwet brown sand, and a sickening whiff showed whence it came.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to distinguish where streets had been. Everything was\r\nburied under fallen walls of cobblestone and pink plaster and tiles,\r\nincluding 20,000 bodies. A New England town would have blown away as\r\nwhite ashes before the giant blowpipe acting on the flame of burning\r\nrum.\r\n\r\nI looked toward the gray old volcano, with shrouded summit. The\r\nlandscape was dusty, like old statuary. Mountain slope and cliff were\r\ndenuded of trees. An overturned factory boiler had holes punctured by\r\nflying stones. A circular marble fountain basin was chipped away on the\r\nvolcano side by bombardment. Old cannon used as mooring posts at the\r\nquay had been uprooted violently. The green landscape ended abruptly at\r\nthe city along a sharp line, with coconut palms half green, half brown.\r\nThere was no motion except steam jets on Pelée’s slopes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I wondered what those steam vents were doing. At first there\r\nhad been one or two along the sea front; but now there were eight, ten,\r\ntwenty, spurting high and scattered all over the volcano. A physician,\r\nDr. Church, was standing near me, and we agreed that we disliked the\r\noutlook. Now there were forty jets, like so many ghostly locomotives\r\nrun out from the Pelée roundhouse. Meanwhile, white-coated officers and\r\nscientists were scattered about in groups under the cliffs, some out of\r\nsight of Mount Pelée.\r\n\r\nWe looked toward the USS _Potomac_; she had seen the steam, and\r\nher own white steam presaged quick, repeated toots of her fog horn.\r\nPellmell the passengers came tumbling to the landing. The sailors\r\nhad no sooner started the boats than two more white-coated figures\r\nappeared, and we had to put back for them. The mountain looked as\r\nthough it were rifting in a hundred places preparatory to an outburst,\r\nand there were many stories of new craters forming. What we saw was\r\nactually the product of a smart rain shower, falling on red hot dry\r\ngravel; but we were to learn later about rain rill explosion. Wherever\r\na stream rill runs down to such contact, a jet of steam forms at once.\r\n\r\nThe main water gorge of the Pelée crater was blown clear of clouds as\r\nwe steamed past, and we saw a cup under the summit amphitheater where a\r\nlake had been, with a pile of scaly looking hot boulders in its midst\r\nsteaming violently. This crater extended into a deep gulch to the\r\nocean, whence had come a disastrous mud flood on May 5 which buried a\r\nsugar mill. This had happened three days before the destruction of St.\r\nPierre. Water preceded steam. The cracks under the gulch undoubtedly\r\ndipped away from the city, and from an unknown chasm athwart the gulch\r\nline ejected water and superheated steam toward the city, like a jet\r\nfrom a hose. This happened on May 8. The ejected material had been in\r\ndry steam, and red hot, accounting for early reports of lava at night.\r\n\r\nI saw molten rock five weeks after the _Potomac_ trip, when the\r\ncrater cone was above the rim of the gorge, apparently large fragments\r\nof brown angular material resting on finer gravel. Cauliflower clouds\r\nof reddish dust spurted up the bed of the gulch below every half hour,\r\nand migrated down the gulch. This was followed by a low growl, perhaps\r\nfrom avalanches. The basin widened during the month, and the dome\r\ngained in height and breadth. A bright incandescent crack at night\r\nwas seen to cross the heap obliquely. A sudden increase of glow was\r\nfollowed by a rumbling, as though the dome were heaving. Breadcrust\r\nbombs of andesite, cracked on their surface in deep gashes, and picked\r\nup on the mountain at both Pelée and Soufrière were pieces of the\r\ninternal lava.\r\n\r\nA chance clearing of the whole dome came two months after the\r\nobliteration of St. Pierre. This we photographed, when brown dust\r\nwas rising, and steam jets appeared southeast on the dome and in the\r\ngulch. On top was an extraordinary spine, shaped like a shark fin, with\r\nsteep escarpment to the east, curved and smooth and scraped to the\r\nwest, pushed up and out of a central rupture of the dome. It was like\r\npaste from a tube, a hard central pencil of lava that had been shoved\r\nup by the expansive force within. Jagged surfaces of breaking showed\r\non the vertical east cliff and long, smooth, arched striations of\r\nscrape appeared on the rounded west profile of the protuberance. Other\r\nhornlike projections showed on the dome. The summit spine was 200 feet\r\nabove the surface of the heap.\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 1902, came the first report of the famous Pelée spine.\r\nIt crumbled in August, and a year later a new spine, facing in the\r\nopposite direction, reached a height of 1,000 feet. It was a central\r\ntongue of the semisolid lava of the dome, sufficiently plastic to be\r\nurged out by forces within. Otherwise the dome was a nearly solid\r\nextrusion covered with fallen bombs. This was the magma, or lava, of\r\nthe Pelée-Soufrière eruptions. Dike ribs extended radially from the\r\nspine athwart the dome. I published an erroneous explanation that the\r\ndome of boulders consisted of old fragments melted by a superblast and\r\nwas not true lava. I was so far right, however, as to anticipate the\r\ngas-heat theory and melting of all volcanism.\r\n\r\nThe direct crisis of these Carib islands in 1902 was introduced by\r\nSoufrière Volcano on St. Vincent, 100 miles south of Martinique, at 1\r\np.m. on May 7, nineteen hours before the St. Pierre disaster. Soufrière\r\nexploded, as the common saying is, through a crater lake pit southwest\r\nof its 4,000-foot summit, the crater edge being 3,500 feet high. It\r\nis notable how many volcanoes are 4,000 feet high, and how many have\r\ncrater pits, not at the top, but along a rift below the peak. Just this\r\nwas the case of Pelée, just this characterizes the calderas of Kilauea\r\nand Mauna Loa. A dozen other volcanoes could be named where the vents\r\nare through the flank of the heap.\r\n\r\nHovey, Curtis, and I were taken by the _Dixie_ to St. Vincent,\r\nwhere the hospitable English colonists provided us with houses at the\r\nbase of Soufrière, and with servants and horses; and the Government\r\nsupply steamer took us around the island. We made the ascent of\r\nSoufrière to the edge of the great crater and looked down at boiling\r\nwaters far below, green and muddy, and sending up a column of steam on\r\none wall.\r\n\r\nWe three Americans guided by T. M. MacDonald, a Scottish planter, made\r\nthe first ascent after the fearful eruptions of May 7 and 18. Leaving\r\nour quarters at Chateau Belair, we climbed on foot from the southwest\r\nbase, with six stalwart negroes carrying instruments, water, and food.\r\nIn the ruins of Wallibu sugar mill we encountered a wild-eyed East\r\nIndian coolie and his helpers looting sugar.\r\n\r\nThe Wallibu River received the brunt of the heavy, dry, red hot,\r\ngravel of the eruptions, drifted like snow and crusted with wet mud.\r\nWater supplied by the river broke its way into the eighty feet of\r\nincandescent fill of the valley. Instantly a steam explosion was hurled\r\nup in white volutes, and the river dammed its own channel with the\r\nstone shower from upblasts. This forced its own waters into fresh hot\r\ncinder and so maintained explosive action. One such exploding river\r\nsent up a column three quarters of a mile high, indescribably majestic,\r\ncausing the natives to report new craters. A shower of mud and sand\r\nfell on our party.\r\n\r\nThe old road crossing Soufrière mountain was destroyed, the river\r\nflats were deeply trenched, and difficult ridges and hollows were\r\nencountered at every step. The gulches were deepened into gorges, the\r\nslopes above furrowed with a feathery rill drainage pattern. Each spur\r\nbetween gulches was like a very steep roof, with a smooth pathway\r\nuphill along the watershed. This made progress easier. Big tree stumps\r\nof _Ficus_ jutted ragged through the hardened mud, the branches\r\ncharred and sharpened by sand blast.\r\n\r\nA whirl of volcanic sand made an unpleasant stinging shower of dust,\r\nand sulfuretted hydrogen smelled of rotten eggs. But near the summit\r\nthe air was fresh and the sunshine bright. A rain would have made\r\nthe mud slippery and perilous, for the gulch slopes were practically\r\ncliffs. Finally we did come to mud clots, resembling a cattle wallow,\r\nknee deep and sticky. Large blocks of rock two feet across lay on the\r\nsurface, flung-out pieces of the old crater walls; and there were some\r\nbombs of new lava.\r\n\r\nAfter three hours we assembled at the rim of the old crater, which\r\nbefore the outbreak had been full of a high crater lake. Suddenly we\r\ncame to an immense chasm almost circular, then the profile of a black\r\nprecipice falling away 2,000 feet; and up its face we saw a silent\r\nsteam column purling away in billows. The bottom was a green pool of\r\nboiling water, muddied by springs from the wall; and a hundred tails of\r\nwhite steam joined the column on the wall.\r\n\r\nThe inner walls showed horizontal bands of old lava, and intrusions\r\nboth in lens shape and as dikes. There were red brown puddingstones\r\nmade up of fragments. A funnel-shaped intrusion looked like the diagram\r\ncross section of a volcano, making a perfect T of gray lava, like a\r\nmushroom. A large fissure, filling west, rose from bottom to top. A\r\nnorthern rocky horseshoe rim, or somma, at the top made the peak of St.\r\nVincent. The crater lip was a mile wide and the interior a half mile\r\ndeep; and the green puddle at the bottom was 1,200 feet across. The\r\nbase of the wall column sputtered fiercely and sent up spurts of black\r\nmud and rock fragments. The lake level was 1,100 feet above the ocean,\r\n800 feet lower than before the eruption; and the pool was shallow, with\r\nmud flats and islets. We operated cameras, compass, and sketch books;\r\npaced off a base line; and noted that the northwest corner of the\r\ncrater had been blown away to leave a big notch.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Chateau Belair, the negro peasant women brought out\r\ntheir children to gaze at us, the godlike men who had dared the crater.\r\nMr. MacDonald had to steer us through the crowd, and we felt like the\r\ntwelve apostles after a miracle.\r\n\r\nThe Soufrière eruption during the first week of May was more voluminous\r\nand violent than that of Pelée, for Pelée was concentrated on one\r\ntarget. Soufrière wrought havoc east and west, whereas Pelée was in\r\na sector southwest of the mountain. They were equally devastating,\r\nhowever, and both made downblasts of superheated steam and gravels.\r\nScalding dust killed people, but so did water waves, conflagration,\r\nsteam, stones, drowning, and burial.\r\n\r\nSoufrière’s dust fall was reported all the way to Trinidad and\r\nBarbados; and from ships east and southeast, directly against the\r\ntrade winds, from 100 to 900 miles away. The dust column penetrated\r\nthe antitrades of the upper atmosphere. Sounds were loud 150 miles\r\naway, but not heard close to the mountains. In the red hot gravel were\r\ninnumerable landslides, river waters rushed into the gravel and made\r\nfalse eruptions, and shore cliffs collapsed.\r\n\r\nNo lava, except as fragments, appeared in St. Vincent, whereas it rose\r\nas a crateral heap in Pelée. Floods of rivers radial to the volcanoes\r\nappeared both before and after the first eruptions, and scientists\r\nerroneously attributed them to cloudburst rains. Later, exact\r\ndescriptions by natives showed that the sources were hot waters gushing\r\nout in places where there was no rain.\r\n\r\nA succession of eruptions at increasing intervals from May to December\r\nactuated both volcanoes. In succeeding years, explosions dwindled; but\r\nover Pelée’s crater rose a mighty dome and spine of stiff quartz-basalt\r\nlava, like ointment from a tube.\r\n\r\nThere was, on Pelée, a splitting of the bottom of the long crater\r\ngulch. Cauliflower steam volutes charged with dust gushed up the\r\ncracks, hard-edged in profile down near the shore, soft and diffuse\r\nnear the crater. Scalding waters in the gulch bottom carried mud. The\r\nmountain was cracking open along radial gulches, and squirting up steam\r\nand geysers, but this all concealed itself with sediment. Nobody ever\r\nsaw the cracks open. The migrating steam clouds charged with gravel\r\nwere called glow clouds and were believed to “flow” as gas fluids from\r\nthe crater.\r\n\r\nAn elucidation of all this mystery came many years later, after a\r\nthorough study of all reports. The glow clouds, which were at first\r\nconfused with the gigantic blasts that had destroyed the city, were\r\ngradually explained. It became apparent that radial cracks are ancient\r\ncharacters of lava domes, and that lava domes lie under heaps of\r\nagglomerate. Pelée and Soufrière are heaps of agglomerate. Kilauea and\r\nMauna Loa are lava domes. Vesuvius is an intermediate type of volcano.\r\n\r\nI remained in the field from May to July, returned to Mount Pelée,\r\ncruised through the northern Caribbee Islands, and went to the bottom\r\nof the deep crater of Mount Misery, on St. Kitts. My guides on St.\r\nKitts were two colored men, Johnny Eddy and Samuel Jim. In the crater\r\nwe found steam and sulfur and a rotten-egg smell, on the bank of a\r\ncold crater lake. We descended by seemingly vertical cliffs covered\r\nwith roots. This was a typical fumarole, or solfatara, one of the\r\nunsatisfactory characteristics of craters. We collected specimens and\r\ntook snapshots, wondered how often such places change suddenly, and\r\nknew hydrogen sulfide gas only by the smell. It all jibed with what I\r\nwas later to discover in Hawaii; that the only way to know a crater is\r\nto live with it, and that gases can melt lava.\r\n\r\nAs I look back on the Martinique expedition, I know what a crucial\r\npoint in my life it was and that it was the human contacts, not field\r\nadventures, which inspired me. Gradually I realized that the killing\r\nof thousands of persons by subterranean machinery totally unknown to\r\ngeologists and then unexplainable was worthy of a life work.\r\n\r\nThe story of Rita Stokes made a tremendous impression on me. In\r\nBarbados hospital I talked with this young white girl and her colored\r\nnurse, Clara King, who had been passengers on the SS _Roraima_\r\nwhich was at St. Pierre when the city was destroyed. When I saw them\r\nthey were swathed in bandages. Clara’s burns were severe on knee, arm,\r\nand hand. Rita’s were on her head, hands, and arms, and one seriously\r\ndisfigured ear. Both were somewhat injured for life. Mrs. Stokes, a\r\nboy, and a baby girl in the cabin with them had been killed. All saw\r\nthe adjacent mountain sending up puffs, as the ship lay at anchor\r\noff the St. Pierre waterfront on the morning of May 8, but they were\r\nreassured by the ship’s officers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the steward rushed by shouting, “Close the cabin door, the\r\nvolcano is coming!” Mrs. Stokes slammed the door just before a terrific\r\nexplosion came which nearly burst the ear drums. The vessel was lifted\r\nhigh and sank down, and all were thrown off their feet by the shock,\r\nand huddled crouching in one corner of the little cabin. Scalding moist\r\nashes poured in through a broken skylight in inky darkness. Next came\r\nsuffocation, relieved by the door bursting open and air rushing in.\r\n\r\nWhen a little daylight came back, Mrs. Stokes and the little boy were\r\nplastered black with hot mud, the baby girl was dying, and the nurse\r\nand Rita were in great agony. A heap of scorching mud had collected on\r\none corner of the floor, and as the young girl put her hand down to\r\nraise herself, her arm plunged to the elbow in scalding sand. They were\r\nall taken out to the deck where mother, boy, and baby died. The ship\r\nwas on fire, and the nearby city was a mass of roaring flames. More\r\nashes fell and scalded the victims. Curiously, third degree burns were\r\nleft on flesh, through underclothing not burned at all.\r\n\r\nClara said that the mountain appeared gray with smoke rolling west,\r\nthat the weather was very calm, and that the dust smelled like\r\ngunpowder. She saw no flames during the blast and did not know what set\r\nfire to the steamer. The fires probably came from the city. Ashes came\r\nin sputtering splashes like “moist marl.” No rocks fell and the grit\r\nin cabin and on burns was wet sand. Before the blast there had been\r\nfalling dust but, according to Clara, no difficulty in breathing. The\r\nsun was brownish red.\r\n\r\nThe bow of the ship was pointed seaward, and the vessel heeled over\r\nleft, then right. The stern, toward the conflagration, caught fire\r\nfirst, the bow later. There was no rumbling, only shock and rattling\r\nthunder all at once, no noise before or after. The only people Clara\r\nKing saw toward the shore were some men on a raft.\r\n\r\nI wrote President Eliot and the American Relief Committee about the\r\ncase of Rita Stokes, half American and the only white woman saved in\r\nSt. Pierre. And I rejoiced to learn from her guardian and uncle, J. E.\r\nCroney of Barbados, that she was provided for. The sum of $450 was sent\r\nto the committee, and $6,000 in trust was set aside for her. She was\r\nnever separated from her devoted nurse, Clara King.\r\n\r\nApart from the experiences of the wounded, I found much to contemplate\r\nin the findings of numerous geologists; in the accounts of doctors,\r\nsailors, naval officers, resident government men, the local newspapers,\r\nand photographers; in the specimens we collected; and in the work of\r\ngreat newspaper and magazine correspondents.\r\n\r\nThe facts and photographs we collected were baffling. They did not\r\ncorrespond with the text books. Two volcanoes a hundred miles apart\r\nsuddenly spouted death downward. Obviously they were connected along\r\nthe island chain, with ocean to the east and ocean to the west.\r\nTelegraph cables were broken. Why? That which lay under the ocean was\r\ntotally unknown, both events and topography. The biggest part of these\r\nvolcanoes was submarine.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes at Pelée were relatively small but often continuous. Tidal\r\nwaves were local and accompanied by downblasts of steam. The downblasts\r\nwere at first supposed to be due to fallen avalanches from the\r\nupblasts. Then it appeared they were really sloping jets from concealed\r\nholes or cracks in the gulches, with inclined orifices amid the blocks\r\nof a cracked-up mountain. For at Pelée the blast that destroyed St.\r\nPierre shot from the crater gulch in cascades of water and steam, while\r\nobservers on high ground saw the horizon, or clear sky, over the crater.\r\n\r\nThe speed of the blast was six miles in two minutes, or 180 miles per\r\nhour. This was different from the glow clouds in the later months,\r\nmigrating slowly along cracks in the gulch bottom.\r\n\r\nMan’s perception of speed relative to himself has nothing to do with\r\nactual speeds. It may be argued that a miniature volcano erupts faster\r\nthan a big volcanic system, but not if the whole terrestrial plexus of\r\nsystems is taken into account. An eruption of Mauna Loa is a very slow\r\naffair, in comparison with the 10,000 underground squirtings of lava in\r\ncracks totally unperceived, except as tremors on seismograph.\r\n\r\nPelée’s eruption was like turning on a hose. A structural valve or\r\norifice, suddenly opened by underground heaving of the mountain block\r\nand letting out steam and mud, appears to be the only reasonable\r\nexplanation of what happened. And the only agents possible were glowing\r\nstiff lava heating boiling water underground. Both of these were later\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\nGrove Karl Gilbert of the U.S. Geological Survey, who had criticized\r\nfavorably my manuscript on the Black Hills intrusive lavas, wrote me\r\nnot to drop the enigma of Mount Pelée, because he found the published\r\nreports unsatisfying. In 1949, forty-seven years after the disaster, I\r\npublished “Steam blast eruptions,” dealing with Pelée. In the interim I\r\nstudied many volcanoes.\r\n\r\nAlexander Agassiz, who had been urging me to do a memoir on volcanoes,\r\nfinanced a trip to Vesuvius when it exploded and poured out lava in\r\n1906. Ottajano northeast of Vesuvius was demolished by jets of gravel\r\nand stones; and Boscotrecase at the south was invaded by black streams\r\nof heavy, sprouting, bouldery slag. Here was a change of habit,\r\nfrom heaping up lavas for thirty-four years, to collapse, internal\r\navalanching, and pure steam explosion accompanied by remnants of\r\nstirred lava flow.\r\n\r\nWhy thirty-four years? A third of a century? Three times the sunspot\r\ninterval? The previous steamblast explosion of Vesuvius before 1906 had\r\nbeen in 1872. In the case of Mount Pelée and Soufrière the intervals\r\nsince past explosions had been fifty-one years and ninety years. But\r\nit should be pointed out that the Carib volcanoes had two years of\r\nterrifying rumblings, odors, and quakes just before 1902. Groundwater\r\nexists in large volume under all three volcanoes. Soufrière, Pelée and\r\nVesuvius all began the steamblasts with collapsing craters, that is,\r\nwith internal lava going down into the bowels of the earth. The lava\r\nusually showed in Vesuvius, whereas at Pelée and Soufrière it merely\r\nmade fumaroles, or gas vents. Man, a mere microbe, could make nothing\r\nof hot sulfurous cracks.\r\n\r\nOn April 25 the electric train slowly pushed us up as far as the\r\nobservatory station, beyond which all was destroyed. Outside Naples\r\nthe fields were covered with two inches of gray-green dust, and pines\r\nand palms were loaded with a two or three foot drift of sand. Near\r\nthe observatory a heavy six-inch mantle of sand and dust buried the\r\nlava fields. The Vesuvian cone was covered with straight sand slides,\r\nwhitish gray, which occasionally slipped downward. The landscape was\r\nshrouded in drifts of white ashes revealing obscurely the slaggy\r\ncontortions of lava beneath. Pure white steam boiled up from the cavity\r\nin the peak, surrounded by an older rain cloud, like a hat on the\r\nvolcano’s crown.\r\n\r\nMy companions--Dr. Tempest Anderson and Messrs. Yeld and Brigg--were\r\nall from Yorkshire. We started the ascent of the twenty-nine degree\r\nslope in a strong west wind. The steam settled down on the summit, than\r\nalternated with clear spells. We followed the west profile of the cone\r\nstraight up, noting how the funicular rails were twisted by landslides.\r\nEverything was covered with pebbles, sand, and dust, with here and\r\nthere large fragments up to five feet across. We found solid footing on\r\nthe radial elevations of either scoured old lava or packed fragments.\r\nThe gullies were filled with deep sand.\r\n\r\nThe rim we could see ahead was the edge of the crater itself. The\r\nabruptness of the fall off, when we finally came to it, was startling\r\nin the extreme. The wind was pelting our necks with stinging sand\r\ngrains which, incidentally, were ruinous to my new Kodak. Only\r\noccasionally did sunshine sift through the mixture of sand, steam,\r\nand cloud. We could make out an inward slope of thirty-five degrees,\r\nterminated 100 feet below by a jutting, fuming precipice. The circular\r\ncurvature of the crater was embayed. The only noise was the howling\r\nwind. We could not see the opposite side of the collapsed cauldron a\r\nhalf mile across. The summit was 4,000 feet above sea level by aneroid\r\nmeasure, 350 feet lower than before the eruption. There was a great\r\nnotch northeast toward Ottajano where thousands of tons of gravel were\r\nhurled clear over the top of Monte Somma, the encircling old ridge. The\r\neast-west diameter was left much greater than that of the north-south.\r\nThe radial ridges and gullies were like a corrugated roof, and sand\r\nmade a flattened angle of scree at the base of the scoured cone. The\r\ncorrugations were not rain erosion, but were made by backfallen debris\r\nsliding. I got some photographs and Mr. Perret gave me others.\r\n\r\nThe big thing was the line of mountain blocks of earth crust. In Italy\r\nit is made up of Ischia, Pozzuoli, Vesuvius, Lipari, and Etna, whereas\r\nthe Carribbee line is made up of Mount Misery, Montserrat, Guadeloupe,\r\nDominica, Martinique, and St. Vincent. Such a line of broken earth\r\nblocks is a volcanic system. Hundreds of miles long, it is never\r\nquiet. A single place seems quiet because superficially we are totally\r\nunconscious of the other places. A microbe on the scalp knows nothing\r\nof the skin of the toes. Men are mere microbes on the skin of shore,\r\nsea, and island. And they are remote from any consciousness of sea\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nVast distances and long intervals are writing records, but man does not\r\nmeasure them. He measures civilization, wars, and dynasties, not the\r\nadventures of the ground he dwells upon. Ground he considers static.\r\nActually it is intensely dynamic. Occasionally it explodes and man\r\nis destroyed. Earth history and volcanic systems make wars look very\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous accumulations of broken rocks over lava beds on the cone\r\nof Vesuvius, and on all the Caribbee Islands, recall the breccias, or\r\nvolcanic conglomerates, of the Yellowstone and of the High Plateaus\r\nof Utah. Floods of basalt alternate with vast falls or outwashes of\r\nvolcanic gravel. Avalanches, landslides, torrents, floods--call them\r\nwhat you will--cover immense areas of the Cordillera. Vesuvius and\r\nPelée pile up cones, but the Caribbees and Italy are also heaped with\r\nagglomerates. Erosion destroys cones, but erosion makes agglomerations\r\nor valley fills of rocks and mud. This is the history of every volcanic\r\nsystem on the globe. Stübel discovered smooth basalt domes like Mauna\r\nLoa under every volcanic system.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 Vesuvius had vented a lava flow which stopped in September, and\r\nits cone was sharp, with only a little crater and inner conelet on top.\r\nIn 1905 lava had flowed from a northwest split. On April 4, 1906, a\r\nsplendid black cauliflower cloud arose. The northwest flow stopped and\r\na southern radial rift made lava mouths progress 500, 1,800, and 2,400\r\nfeet below the top, more than halfway down the mountain. From the lower\r\nmouth came glassy pahoehoe, or smooth destructive streams intensely\r\nincandescent and liquid, quickly cooling to aa, or sprouting rough\r\nfudge, black crusts, and clinker. The molten porridge flowed as a snaky\r\navalanche into the masonry village of Boscotrecase.\r\n\r\nOn April 7, at the crater, a column of boulder-laden steam shot up four\r\nmiles, snapping with lightning. New lava mouths sent forking snakes\r\ncrushing and swallowing parts of the village. A graveyard was neatly\r\nfilled within its masonry wall, showing that internally the rocky\r\ntorrent was a liquid.\r\n\r\nMeantime trajectories like those of a hose sent falls of gravel for\r\nmiles, to Ottajano on the opposite side of the mountain. These also\r\ncame from the central crater. On the west flank, at the observatory,\r\nthe house was rocking, and heavy stones forced its occupants to\r\nretreat. Matteucci and his staff went halfway down the cone, to return\r\nnext day. Explosions dwindled during the next fortnight, though one day\r\nan adverse wind from the crater carried carbon dioxide and hydrogen\r\nsulfide almost asphyxiating some persons. Thereafter cauliflower clouds\r\nof white steam arose and the noise of big avalanches was heard.\r\n\r\nThe clinker field that invaded Boscatrecase was 16 feet thick, and\r\nhouses were cut in two by a slaggy torrent. In Ottajano, on the\r\nopposite side of the mountain, flat tile roofs collapsed, buried under\r\nthree feet of heavy gravel, some of it the size of an apple. Nearer the\r\ncrater, boulders five feet in diameter were thrown a mile. The volcano\r\nwas probably blocked inside by welling lava on the Boscotrecase side,\r\nwhich caused it to vomit steam and earthy avalanche material obliquely\r\noutward on the opposite, Ottajano, side.\r\n\r\nThe Italians have a word, _sprofondimento_, which means to make\r\nprofound by insucking, that expresses what happened. This plexus of\r\nuprush of slag and inrush of avalanche, against a water-steam geyser,\r\nboth happening at once, was very different from the quiet outpouring of\r\nlava during the preceding years. It definitely meant rupture of earth\r\nblocks, deep escape of that lava probably at the underocean part of\r\nthe radial cracks, and deep entrance of spring water into incandescent\r\nvacated chambers. It meant a rupture crisis, collapsing the peak, and\r\na new geyser quite unrecognized. The eruption ended when the slag\r\npressure was relieved, the mountain blocks had settled, and the frozen\r\nslag had shut off groundwater. The remaining lava entered into decades\r\nof deep accumulation and gas bubbling, the solfataric phase. That which\r\nended the thirty-year upbuilding was probably downward pressure due to\r\nweight of surface heaping of the cone. Cracking released water inward.\r\n\r\nThe next thirty-eight years were to culminate in a similar crisis\r\nfor Vesuvius which lasted ten days, and again its peak collapsed.\r\nThis was in March 1944, when our American troops entered Naples. It\r\nis interesting that these culminations have been from a third to a\r\nhalf century apart, but the meaning of intervals can only be really\r\nunderstood when volcanoes like Etna, Stromboli, and Vesuvius are\r\ngrouped together. The same thing is true of Kilauea and Mauna Loa,\r\nand of Pelée and St. Vincent. Ponte reports the eruptions of Etna as\r\nten years apart, similar to the sunspot interval; and Perret notes a\r\nten-year interval for the smaller eruptions of Vesuvius. We measured an\r\neleven-year interval for Hawaii, with culminations close to the minimum\r\nof sunspots. A culmination is when lava goes down and keeps quiet, or\r\nwhen sunspot numbers go down and remain few. No one knows why, or of\r\nany connecting cause.\r\n\r\nThree eleven-year culminations make a third of a century, when at\r\nKilauea and Vesuvius, something bigger happens. Sunspots have numbered\r\na suspiciously similar curve at corresponding dates.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of Vesuvius taken just before the 1944 collapse showed\r\nthe 1906 crater hole completely filled and overflowing. There was an\r\ninner flat floor, a conelet standing in the middle. The 1944 eruption\r\ncollapsed the conelet, split the big outer cone, and sent flows to\r\ndestroy San Sebastiano and several villages. The torrents of ash\r\nkilled people and the electric station of the funicular railroad was\r\ndestroyed, as usual. The mountain split in several directions.\r\n\r\nJust as in 1906, the stages of the 1944 outbreak were lava flows,\r\nmixed lava gushing intensely liquid, crateral caving in, tremendous\r\ngas emission, black ash changing to vapor and white ash as the\r\nemission increased, and ultimately white steam. The black ash was the\r\ncontemporaneous lava with dark augite; the snowlike white ash was\r\nground up old lavas, containing the white crystals, leucite.\r\n\r\nThe liquid phase took an unusual fountain form, resembling that of\r\nMauna Loa in Hawaii, and nine spells of bright incandescent explosive\r\nfountaining occurred. The collapse began on March 13; the fountaining\r\noccurred during March 20 to 22, with jets of bright liquid lava and\r\nflames, 1,000 to 3,000 feet high; and the crater became a lava lake.\r\nThe flames were occasioned by hydrogen within the lava itself, and\r\nperhaps some carbon gases. This liquid fountaining phase was the\r\nculmination of explosions, making pumice, with water vapor the gaseous\r\nproduct. Ash fell four feet deep three miles away, and some fell on the\r\nAdriatic coast. Both white steam clouds and black ash clouds arose with\r\nthe fountains, white and black side by side.\r\n\r\nThe net effect was to leave a bowl 1,500 feet in diameter and 800 feet\r\ndeep, floored with avalanche gravel. This reconstructed the funnel\r\nof 1906, and as in 1906, the height of the rim was 4,100 feet after\r\neruption. In other words, the thirty-eight years had filled the vast\r\ncrater, only to have 1944 engulf and eject the contents, and strew them\r\ndown the slopes, adding an immense weight to the outer shell of the\r\ncone.\r\n\r\nA hundred million cubic yards of lava was poured out, and 50 million\r\ncubic yards of ash now lie on the volcano. Three times as much was\r\ncarried far away, and the volume of gases was ten times as great.\r\nThe rock fragments, probably 200 times as great, were engulfed by\r\navalanches.\r\n\r\nThe big achievement of an eruption is to wedge open a mountain, let\r\nthe internal lava effervesce and go down, admit ground water, and make\r\nspectacular fireworks of burning gas and meltings. Release of pressure\r\nby splitting open the crust permits a great show of fiery foaming,\r\nbut no geologist sees the profound accomplishment of lava sinking\r\nand flowing away by underground channels. It may flow out along the\r\nMediterranean Sea bottom. At Vesuvius, it may slip through deep cracks\r\nin the direction of Sicily.\r\n\r\nCertainly a periodic adjustment of the big system\r\n(Vesuvius-Stromboli-Etna) has taken place deep down in the earth, and\r\nthe thirty-eight years of accumulation mean a stress by weighting down.\r\nThe pressure of 100 million tons of stored lava inside a weak cone\r\nmountain and ready to effervesce with heat and give up its hydrogen is\r\nwhat science too often forgets.\r\n\r\nThe continental crack system between crust blocks and full of rain\r\nwater is waiting to assist the crisis, while the blocks are poised\r\nover uprising gases of the ages. The gases of the ages, reaching to\r\nthe core of the globe, are eternally melting the walls with white-hot\r\ncore matter, walls of siliceous rock blocks 1,800 miles deep. In this\r\nsystem, Vesuvius is a tiny pimple. Incidentally, the 1944 earthquakes\r\nwere recorded in largest number during the period when the liquid\r\npumice fountains were in action in the nine different spells between\r\nMarch 20 and March 23. This means that the maxima of engulfing\r\ncrater, seething slag, outrushing gas, crunching mountain weight, and\r\navalanching inner walls were all happening together. The clogging of\r\nvents forced the ground water steam into pulsations. This could not\r\nlast; the mountain blocks settled and resumed pressure, deep lava\r\ndrained off, heat dwindled, and gas was relieved. The bigger volcanic\r\nsystem asserted its downward weight of the adjusted globe.\r\n\r\nBy making much of pulsations and thirty-three year intervals, we are\r\ndreaming of an ideal volcano such as might be constructed as was our\r\ngeyser apparatus. But there is no question of the reality of tides\r\nin rock, as well as in ocean; of day and night; cold and sunshine;\r\nyear and century. Continent and ocean are positive, globe and solar\r\nsystem are positive. The ideal volcano is part of a tidal system and\r\nis limited in size. Therefore science has a right to inquire how it\r\nhappens that through centuries most volcanoes stay 4,000 feet high. It\r\nhas a right to look for averages and periodicities, just as a doctor\r\nlooks for respiration, temperature, and heartbeats.\r\n\r\nLike men, volcanoes are not all alike, but both men and volcanoes are\r\norderly organisms. The object of volcanology is to find order and\r\nrelate the small orderliness to the big regularity of globe and solar\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nMy 1906 visit at the end of the Vesuvian eruption crystallized my\r\nlifework idea, begun at Pelée; but my accomplishment was dwarfed to\r\ntriviality by that of Perret, whom I first met while he was assisting\r\nthe Italian volcano observatory. He was a photographer and observer\r\nof rare merit. He had been living in Naples and photographing all the\r\nItalian volcanoes, and he had worked out a solar control diagram for\r\npredicting volcano tides. Italy had made a volcanologist out of a\r\nphysicist-engineer. Discovery of Perret meant to me much more than any\r\nphenomenon of geology.\r\n\r\nFrank Alvord Perret was an electrical engineer from Brooklyn, and a\r\ngenius with an ordinary Kodak. He took at Vesuvius, by sheer daring,\r\nthe most remarkable photographs ever made of an active volcano. His\r\nknowledge of astronomy, meteorology, and physics made him see in a\r\nvolcano something to study close at hand, as Benjamin Franklin studied\r\na thunderstorm. He developed and printed his photographs himself,\r\nand colored his lantern slides. He helped Matteucci, the observatory\r\ndirector on Vesuvius, and was decorated as Chevalier by the King of\r\nItaly. He tramped close to lava vents and explosion clouds, and took\r\nhundreds of pictures.\r\n\r\nPerret and I had exactly the same conception of a volcano. We thought\r\nof it as a living organism to record, just as rainfall is recorded\r\nby the weather man. For our recording, we had to invent volcano\r\ninstruments. Though the camera was Perret’s supreme instrument, he had\r\nbeen an electrical inventor all his life. Businessmen in Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, financed his work in Italy; and I went to Springfield to\r\nlecture and encourage their research association, the predecessor of\r\nour Hawaiian association.\r\n\r\nPerret photographed Etna, Stromboli, Teneriffe, Sakurajima, Kilauea,\r\nthe Carib cones and other volcanoes, and performed heroic work at the\r\nMessina earthquake of 1908. When, in 1929, Pelée entered into another\r\nof its periods of exploding and heaving it was studied critically by\r\nPerret who had established a museum and observatory at Martinique. He\r\nfinally settled down at his museum in St. Pierre, and was of great\r\nservice at the Montserrat earthquake crisis of 1933 and thereafter. He\r\nwas not physically strong and the volcanic dust gave him pneumonia, but\r\nseveral times he recovered from attacks. He died in New York, having\r\nbeen forced north by the second World War.\r\n\r\nI also met the Yorkshire oculist, geologist, and photographer, Dr.\r\nTempest Anderson, on Vesuvius in 1906. This was another happy meeting.\r\nHe too was a skilled volcano photographer, and had taken pictures\r\nin New Zealand and Iceland with his privately built cameras, using\r\nmethods of extreme originality. He afterwards made for me a camera\r\nwith small glass plates, dark chamber, arm sleeves, no plate-holder,\r\nalpenstock tripod, bottle strip-testing developer, self-drying metal\r\ncase, and great perfection of rigidity and focus. We were to meet again\r\nand again in different parts of the world. He became one of the British\r\nexperts sent to Soufrière by the Royal Society. He died of typhoid on a\r\nvolcano voyage to the Philippines.\r\n\r\nShortly after my Vesuvius expedition I moved from Harvard to become\r\nhead of geology at Massachusetts Tech. My teaching overlapped that of\r\nProfessors W. Niles and W. O. Crosby at Tech and Wellesley, while for\r\na time I continued my Harvard work. It was at this time that I began\r\nto think of possible ways of financing an expedition to the Aleutian\r\nIslands and their forty active volcanoes. The year 1906–1907 was a\r\ntime of financial boom, so I went to Calumet and Hecla, the great\r\ncopper company of which Agassiz was president. To my astonishment they\r\nsubscribed $1,000 to start the Technology Expedition. State Street and\r\nWall Street raised this to $13,000 in ten days, and I learned much\r\nabout the availability of money during a boom of the stock market.\r\nPresident Pritchett of Harvard approved the expedition, and I organized\r\nit for a sailing schooner from Seattle, with nine in the crew and seven\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _5. Scientists of Technical Expedition to\r\n  Aleutians, 1907; left to right: Jaggar, Gummere, Vandyke, Eakle,\r\n  Sweeney, and Myers_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _6. Captain George Seeley of the _Lydia_,\r\n  Technical Expedition to Aleutians, 1907_]\r\n\r\nWe set sail in the spring of 1907 and spent four months in that ocean\r\nof gales, fogs, rain, and cold between Dutch Harbor and Atka--the\r\neastern half of the Aleutians. One man, Colby, was a bear hunter who\r\nexplored the Alaskan Peninsula and reported on coal and gold. The\r\nscientists were two geologists, two mining students, a physician who\r\nwas also botanist and entomologist, and an astronomer. They were Eakle,\r\nMyers, Sweeny, Vandyke, and Gummeré. The sailing master and mate were\r\nuncle and nephew, both Nova Scotians named Seeley. The following poem\r\nby the master tells the story better than I could.\r\n\r\n                           AN ALASKAN IDYLL\r\n\r\n    An Eastern College of renown\r\n    Had purchased in Seattle town\r\n    The schooner Lydia of ill fame\r\n    And Seeley was the Captain’s name.\r\n    The Scientist they numbered seven\r\n    Their subjects ranged from H----l to Heaven\r\n    One on volcano’s one on stars\r\n    Botany, bugs, short cuts to Mars.\r\n\r\n    Like knights of old were they prepared to shoot\r\n    The mighty whale, ferocious malamoot.\r\n    Good fellows all.

The journal of the expedition, thirty-seven pages\r\nlong with photographs, was published by the _Technology Review_.\r\n\r\nLike every such volcano expedition, we were hampered by the\r\nnecessity of using a sailing vessel, by bad weather, by rain which\r\ninterfered with photography, by long spells on the open sea in fog,\r\nand by inaccessible craters amid the ice of mountain tops. From the\r\nadministrative viewpoint, two things stood out: the need for an\r\namphibian boat, independent of harbors, and the need for a land station\r\nmore or less permanent, wherefrom an amphibian boat could operate to\r\nreach and land on determinate beaches. A permanent station could work\r\non specimens in bad weather. These discoveries determined the policy\r\nthat was to eventuate in the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, to the\r\nbuilding of amphibian boats, and to five other Aleutian journeys by\r\n1932.\r\n\r\nI might describe sliding down the slippery grass of Unalaska, on the\r\nsteep slopes peculiar to the Aleutians; exploring ice craters on top\r\nof Makushin in Unalaska; or getting storm bound for five days trying\r\nto reach Atka’s Korovinski Volcano on foot. But these tales have been\r\npublished elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe most exciting of the Aleutian volcanoes is Bogoslof, a peak\r\nsubmerged north of Umnak, with its crater, a line of erupting crags,\r\njust at sea level. We had good luck with weather and landed on Bogoslof\r\nin the forenoon of August 7, 1907. Hundreds of sea lions, bellowing\r\nclose to the dories, would pop up and stare at us and then plunge\r\nfrantically beneath the waves. On the beach we found one bull asleep,\r\nbut he awoke and awkwardly floundered to the sea. The islet was then\r\nfour peaks with sand flats between, the central one a steaming mass of\r\nlava protuberances shaped like potatoes. Next to it was a half cone\r\nbroken in two, with a horned spine like a shark fin; Pelée all over\r\nagain. It was also similar to New Zealand’s White Island. At the two\r\nends of the island were older, peaked lava rocks. The active heap was\r\n450 feet high with bright yellow coatings, and a ring pool of hot salt\r\nwater around it, yellow with iron-stained mud. The rocky cliffs were\r\ncovered with thousands of murres, their chicks, and eggs; and the birds\r\ndarkened the sky in flight. The stench from offal and rotten eggs was\r\nintense.\r\n\r\nThe sea was full of fish, the beaches were full of sea lions, the hot\r\nlava and air were full of birds. Thus life and deadly volcanism lived\r\ntogether. The active rock was refractory basalt, semisolid, crusting\r\nand breaking into blocks as it rose from a submerged crater.\r\n\r\nOn September 1 after we left, the crater exploded, throwing sand and\r\ndust a distance of 100 miles to the east. The middle heap was engulfed,\r\nleaving only a lagoon; and the remaining peaks were shrouded in a heavy\r\nmantle of debris. Such a history of building and bursting and spreading\r\nout as a shoal has gone on for more than 111 years. Bogoslof is the\r\npeak of a submarine Pelée, several thousand feet above sea bottom. It\r\nis always active, the index volcano of the Aleutians.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that the need for observatories began to be\r\nrecognized. Something new and of grave menace had come into geology,\r\nterrible steam blasts capable of shooting out horizontally and\r\nexplosively. And even as I write in 1952 these have been taking human\r\nlives at Mount Lamington in Papua and Mount Hibokhibok on Camiguin\r\nIsland of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAt Vesuvius, under Palmieri, an observatory had been established\r\nabout 1859. The director was interested in meteorology as affected by\r\nVesuvius, and annual reports were published irregularly. Successive\r\ndirectors became interested in making instruments for volcano science\r\nand Mercalli, the director in 1907, published a book in Italian on the\r\nactive volcanoes of the world. When I went to Mount Pelée I was mindful\r\nof the venture at Vesuvius; and Professor Lacroix of Paris established\r\nartillery officers near St. Pierre ruins after the disaster, to watch\r\nand report as a volcano observatory. They furnished details and\r\nphotographs of the many eruptions and the growth of the lava dome and\r\nspine. Doctors Hovey, Flett, Anderson, Lacroix, and Heilprin returned\r\nto Mount Pelée and added much to the observational and photographic\r\nrecord, and Dr. Stübel published a special book inspired by critical\r\nstudy of the Caribbees, in comparison with Andean volcanoes.\r\n\r\nHovey and I put through a resolution in 1907 at the meeting of the\r\nGeological Society of America, “strongly recommending the establishment\r\nof volcano and earthquake observatories.” Perret and I were both\r\ninventors of instruments, both experimenters, and both convinced that\r\nthe expedition method alone would never solve the volcano problem. The\r\nbrothers Friedlaender of Zurich were establishing a “Zeitschrift für\r\nVulkanologie,” in Naples, and a laboratory with German, Swiss, and\r\nItalian assistants. The Carnegie Institution established in Washington\r\na geophysical laboratory devoted to high temperature physical\r\nchemistry. We others were influenced by field ambition, and since 1899\r\nI had fought for a Hawaii geological survey, for I was convinced that\r\nKilauea Volcano there must have an American volcano observatory.\r\n\r\nMy experiments on erosion, sedimentation, deformation, and eruption\r\nconvinced me that a field experimental science was bound to grow up in\r\neach of those parts of dynamical geology. All of these needed field\r\nobservatories to determine index of erosion, index of sedimentation,\r\nindex of ground movement and earthquake, index of volcanism; these\r\nindices to be quantitative just as the thermometer and barometer and\r\nwind gauge made climatology a quantitative science of the air. I found\r\nalmost nothing being accomplished in these new field sciences. No one\r\ndreamt of attacking the Mississippi as a field of pure science of\r\nerosionology, compared to the Amazon. It was felt that these things\r\ncould be left to commerce and the engineers.\r\n\r\nBy index of eruption I mean the geographical peculiarity of Vesuvius,\r\nfor example, as an eruption center. Perret tried to reduce this to\r\ndiagram form. I published, in Washington, a plea for geophysical\r\nobservatories.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake in 1908, predicted and photographed by Perret, had killed\r\n125,000 people in Italy at Messina, near Mount Etna. Hence I felt more\r\nstrongly than ever that something must be done. So it was that in 1909,\r\nat my own expense, I made a journey to Hawaii and Japan with my family.\r\nEverything within me converged on making a life work of the results of\r\nmy Pacific journey.\r\n\r\nIn Honolulu I was invited to show my colored lantern slides of the\r\nMount Pelée disaster and to describe Massachusetts Tech’s plan for a\r\nseismograph station on Blue Hill near Boston. When the Honorable L. A.\r\nThurston of the _Pacific Commercial Advertiser_ interviewed me\r\nafter the lecture, and asked whether Kilauea Volcano on the island of\r\nHawaii would not be better than Blue Hill, I replied that it certainly\r\nwould have many more earthquakes and, in addition, would offer volcano\r\nlavas to observe in action. Thurston asked, “Is it then a question\r\nof money?” I replied that it was, largely, but that it also entailed\r\npersuading Tech authorities that I was right.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting Kilauea, where I stayed at the Volcano House and saw\r\nHalemaumau lava pit in action, I went on to Japan. There I visited the\r\nseismograph stations of Professor Omori and traveled to active Tarumai\r\nVolcano in Hokkaido. Tarumai, which was undergoing an interesting\r\neruption at that time, is a 4,000 foot cone in pine forests on the\r\nnorth island of Japan. (Notice the usual 4,000 feet.) It had broken\r\nout explosively, sent up a great spiral of cauliflower clouds of steam\r\nand ash thousands of feet, and followed this by piling up a lava dome\r\nin its summit crater, the dome lifting the crater floor and protruding\r\nabove the top of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThis was an extrusion of andesite, more refractory and giving hotter\r\nsteam than Kilauea vents, as measured with an electric thermometer. We\r\ngot 450° Centigrade with Bristol thermocouple in sulfur-covered cracks\r\nhissing on the actual face of the lava dome. Kilauea had given 300°\r\nCentigrade in the famous “postal card crack” where visitors browned\r\ntheir cards.\r\n\r\nThe stiff rising lava dome of Tarumai was a duplicate of the lavas of\r\nBogoslof and Pelée, but Bogoslof was a crater at sea level, and Pelée’s\r\nbig dome and spine above the mountain top developed in the second year\r\nof eruptions. I found further inspiration in a visit to Asama volcano\r\nin central Japan. Here, just as at Tarumai, the hard lava lay in a\r\nrigid swirl, hissing and steaming at the bottom of the summit crater\r\nafter the crater had announced eruption by “cauliflower” uprushes.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that hard lava push-ups from the bottom of craters were\r\ncharacteristic of the Pacific and Carib shores, in contrast to Hawaiian\r\nand Italian flow-downs. The pressure upward breaks a mountain, the slag\r\nand boiling groundwater inside churns up avalanche gravel and dust,\r\ncolumns of dust-laden steam rush out, the break-up lets up lava, and\r\naccording to its frothing gas and heat and the air temperature, it is\r\ncapable physically of either foaming out liquid through radial cracks\r\nor pushing up semisolid and piling as an aa heap.\r\n\r\nThe net effect is flat lava shields for Hawaii, with flows into and\r\nunder the ocean, and shapely high cones for the Andes and Japan, with\r\nItaly somewhere in between. The difference in the lavas is a matter of\r\ninternal meltability, due to chemistry and gases.\r\n\r\nIn the first decade of the twentieth century this was new to me as\r\na geologist, for the books did not explain internal gas in lava.\r\nGeography understood nothing of the relation of a volcano to lines\r\nof cracking earth crust and depth of crust, and gigantic explosions\r\ndominated history as exceptions. Refractory slags were then believed\r\nto be stiff by reason of chemical fusibility, and gas in solution in\r\na melt is not understood even today. The Japan journey explained the\r\ntextbook contrast between oceanic Hawaii and continental Ecuador, both\r\nvolcanic, and the further contrast with Yellowstone agglomerates, and\r\nintrusions of the Black Hills of South Dakota. Clearly Hawaii must be\r\nstudied, and experimental geology extended to the globe as a laboratory.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Honolulu, Professor Ralph Hosmer, forester, met me and\r\nreported that Honolulu money was available, if Massachusetts Tech would\r\nsend me to Hawaii to found a volcano experiment station. Then and there\r\nthe Hawaiian Volcano Research Association formed by business leaders\r\nin Honolulu became a reality, to crystallize later into an educational\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, while I was still a professor at Massachusetts Tech, the\r\nUnited Fruit Company invited me to go in one of their ships to study\r\nthe earthquake destruction of Cartago, Costa Rica. I saw an opportunity\r\nto study seismology in the field, as I had studied volcanology in\r\nMartinique. The United Fruit Company owned the railroad and much of\r\nthe national debt of Costa Rica. F. R. Hart, treasurer of M. I. T.\r\nand director of the fruit company told me to make my own plans and\r\nthe company would pay all expenses. Knowing that engineering is of\r\nfirst importance in earthquake disaster, I invited Professor Charles\r\nSpofford, head of our Civil Engineering Department, to go with me, and\r\nhe promptly accepted.\r\n\r\nOur journey was from New Orleans, in one of the splendid snow-white\r\nsteamers of the fruit company. This ship, going by Belize in British\r\nHonduras, took us to Limon on the Caribbean side of Costa Rica, a place\r\nof banana plantations and Jamaica-negro labor. From Limon we took a\r\nmountain-climbing, narrow-gauge railroad, to the high and healthful\r\ncapital, San Jose. We passed the ruins of the city of Cartago, with\r\nits earthquake tumbled churches and wrecked lower buildings, all\r\ncovered with heavy roofs of red tiles. Don Anastasio Alfaro, government\r\nscientist, showed us seismographs and maps, and we called on President\r\nJimenez, who owned a dairy farm on the high slopes of Irazu Volcano\r\ndirectly above Cartago. I arranged with the President to have the\r\ngovernment make an official inquiry all over the Republic, suggesting a\r\nstudy of ten grades of earthquake damage, adapted to Central American\r\nhabits. These grades, from mere alarm up to wrecked churches, were to\r\napply to what had happened in each place. According to the answers, we\r\nwould make for each place a numerical value of intensity and plot these\r\non the map.\r\n\r\nWe visited the wreckage of Cartago, where the quake had come like the\r\ncrack of a whip on May 4, 1910, just at the supper hour. An American\r\nrailway conductor and his family were seated at table and with the\r\nfirst jarrings, they all pitched forward under the dining room table.\r\nWhen the low adobe house fell on top of them, the table saved their\r\nlives. A pathetic object was the hollow square of the Carnegie Palace,\r\ndesigned by a Costa Rican architect to promote Central American\r\npeace. It was improperly braced, and everything came down, including\r\nthe ornate stone wall around the grounds; and a cracked gate post\r\nheld a melancholy buzzard in the hideous ruin. This and several of\r\nthe big churches, cracked and disrupted, gave Spofford food for his\r\narchitectural notes.\r\n\r\nThe President’s farm on Irazu was a lovely place of green glades, fat\r\ncattle, and attractive Spanish dairymaids, at an altitude of more than\r\n9,000 feet. The crater of Irazu at 10,300 feet was a tumbled depression\r\non the top of the mountain with a steaming solfatara on one side, and a\r\nlot of circular holes inside, within a rim more or less circular.\r\n\r\nPoas crater was very different, with a crater lake of boiling water\r\nsurrounded by bright-colored horizontal layers of ash. We found buried\r\nbombs from a recent eruption which had punctured the soil with holes\r\none or two feet across. There was wild adventure for me in being given\r\na horse at 4 A.M., equipped with a rotten saddle, which slipped when\r\nI mounted him. The horse resented me in the early morning darkness,\r\nhaving just left his grain, and immediately bucked off both me and the\r\nsaddle. More adventure followed. On the ride up the mountain and in the\r\nmidst of the forest we encountered a jaguar trap which had recently\r\ncaught two big cats. It was a pen, roofed with logs baited with a\r\nfowl, and disguised with brush; a shutter fell and closed the opening\r\nwhen the bait was touched. On the way down we had a terrific tropical\r\nthunder storm, with sheets of cold rain, and I got chilled to the bone\r\nand was sick with dysentery for two or three days.\r\n\r\nThere are a dozen volcanoes like these two on the backbone of the Costa\r\nRica rocky mountains. They trend in a ragged line from the Panama\r\nboundary on the southeast, to Nicaragua on the northwest. All have\r\nrecords of explosive activity, but lava flows are rare. Beginning at\r\nNicaragua the line of the Cordillera, capped with volcanoes, continues\r\nthrough Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala; and some of the lower ones\r\nhave lava flows. Cosequina is famous among them; and conspicuous as a\r\nfrequently active volcano is Santa Ana in Salvador, one peak of which\r\nis Izalco, the index volcano of Central America, erupting frequently.\r\nOther index volcanoes are Kilauea for Hawaii, Stromboli for Italy, and\r\nBogoslof for the Aleutians. The next line of volcanoes, also trending\r\nnorthwest, extends from Guatemala into southern Mexico. The Costa Rica\r\nline overlaps the northeast side of the Nicaragua-Salvador line, and\r\nthis in turn overlaps the Guatemala line, and so on. The chains of\r\nvolcanoes are over an echelon of cracks, surmounted by heaped-up lava\r\npeaks on the continental divide.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of experimenting with volcanoes, the exploration\r\nof the Cartago earthquake and Poas and Irazu craters and a study of\r\ntheir relations typified the unsatisfactory combination of upheaved\r\nmountains of strata and of volcanic eruptions and underground friction.\r\nThis extends all the way along the Cordillera from Patagonia to Alaska.\r\nI say unsatisfactory because from the science standpoint, the action\r\nof eruption or earthquake is far scattered in time and place, and only\r\nlocal observatory geophysics and traveling scientists will do the work.\r\nCartago is directly at the foot of Irazu Volcano, but the volcano did\r\nnot erupt simultaneously with the earthquake. In the same way Messina\r\nis at the foot of Etna, and Tokyo is at the foot of Fujiyama; and the\r\ngreat earthquakes do not accord with eruptions. Sakurajima in 1914 was\r\nan exception, it had a quake after outbreak.\r\n\r\nThe direct outcome of my study, on the map of Costa Rica, of lines\r\nof equal earthquake effects, showed the maximum of the 1910 quake on\r\nthe continental backbone, and the lines were crowded together along\r\nthe western mountains. However, they spread out wider and wider along\r\nthe Caribbean coastal plain, which is an elevated sea bottom on the\r\nnortheast side of the country. In other words the terrific jolt was\r\na deep slipping or scraping under the volcano line, and the elastic\r\nwaves of like strong effects were close together in the mountains\r\non the Pacific side, opposed by hard rock. On the other hand these\r\nwaves, much feebler, widened out their lines in going through flat,\r\nsoft strata on the Caribbean side. The answer seems to be that along\r\nthe jagged rupture which underlies the volcanoes there is continuous\r\nupward pressure of lava, which occasionally is accelerated into a big\r\nbump or slip, now here, now there, as the whole great mountain range\r\nvolcanically heaves through the ages.\r\n\r\nOur next journey was from Barrios across to Guatemala City, where we\r\nhad distant views of such volcanoes as the pure cone of Agua and the\r\nsharp peak of Santa Maria, which in October of 1902 had blown out its\r\nflank and left a vast hole. The Guatemalan plateau of rich soil and\r\nabundant market products rises gradually from the wet banana lands on\r\nthe Caribbean side to a height of 4,870 feet at Guatemala City. This\r\nis on the line of volcano cracks. Then the land plunges abruptly in a\r\nprecipitous down-faulted slope, to a low flat shelf along the Pacific\r\nOcean. This shelf is covered with the merging of many deltas formed\r\nby the streams and torrents which drain the well-watered plateau.\r\nAlong this line at the top of the precipice is the chain of volcanoes,\r\nwith rich coffee lands at their feet on the upper slopes. Coffee\r\nplantations were destroyed by steam, mud flood, and ash blasts in 1902,\r\nand similar destruction was destined to begin again in 1923.\r\n\r\nA large model of Central America has been built in a park in the\r\nopen air in Guatemala City, showing magnificently the upland plateau\r\nand its mountains, the flat slope to the east, and the long straight\r\nsteep plunge to the Pacific coastal shelf. This is one of the best\r\nillustrations of the block faulting of a continent, lifted like a huge\r\nflat slab along a crack, and tilted away from the Pacific. The Pacific\r\nblock dropped down.\r\n\r\nThe same structure is true, on a larger scale, of the line of the\r\nAndes, lifted as a volcano-covered slab, down-faulted along the Chilean\r\ncoastal plain. The upland slopes away to the basin of the Amazon. In\r\nthese studies we are experimenting with volcanoes on the scale of\r\ngeography, but the principles involved apply to Mexico and to the\r\nCascade Range in Oregon. They probably apply also to the Aleutian, the\r\nKamchatkan, and the western Pacific arcs, considered as upheaved and\r\neroded ridges. They are arcs because they are ancient calderas.\r\n\r\nWe traveled by steamer along the Pacific coast to Panama, where the\r\ncanal was being finished. We were impressed by General Goethals and\r\nhis associate engineers, and with the marvellous organization of big\r\nengineering as the United States could administer it. Yellow fever had\r\nbeen conquered, ships constantly brought dairy products from New York\r\nto canal employees, houses were screened and unglazed, and the jungle\r\nwas cut back to limits of safety from the mosquitoes. We found lively\r\nyoung American college graduates, both men and women, playing tennis in\r\nthe deep tropics, where earlier hundreds had died of fever. We arrived\r\njust at the time when sides of the Culebra Cut were continuously\r\nsliding inward like a glacier, to close up the ditch. The ground under\r\na village at the top of the bank was cracking in long crevasses, and\r\nhabitations had to be abandoned. The only answer was to dig away the\r\nhill with hundreds of dump cars, until the slope was flat enough to\r\nstop sliding.\r\n\r\nAn amusing episode occurred at the Pacific end of the canal, where\r\ngiant monitors, or hose nozzles, were being used to cut away the banks.\r\nEngineer Williamson had conceived the idea of mounting these monitors\r\non concrete barges made on the spot. He covered the frames with steel\r\nmesh, and sprayed concrete against the mesh until a water-tight hull\r\nwas produced. Fellow engineers jeered at Williamson and said that a\r\nboat made of rock would surely sink. Someone asked Williamson, when his\r\nfirst barge bore up the heavy monitors and was successful, what he was\r\ngoing to name it. He painted the name in large letters on the barge\r\n“Ivory Soap, it floats.”\r\n\r\nWe met in Costa Rica and Panama Arthur Herschel, city engineer of\r\nKingston, Jamaica, who was responsible for the reconstruction of that\r\ncity after the terrific earthquake of 1907. Herschel invited Spofford\r\nand me to stay with him on our way home, stopping off when we passed\r\nJamaica. We did so, were delightfully entertained, and learned about\r\nengineering and rehabilitation after the most intense earthquake of all\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe momentary intensity of the quake had been utterly without warning,\r\nas though two mountains had collided, and the masonry of the business\r\nsection of Kingston crumbled almost instantaneously. A British major\r\nwas walking along the main thoroughfare, carrying a heavy walking\r\nstick, when at the other end of the street, he noticed a commotion and\r\nthought it was a negro riot. The disturbance came toward him with a\r\nroar, and he saw clouds of dust rise from the street like a tornado and\r\napproach him. He felt the ground jolting, raised his stick, and decided\r\nto stand and fight it. The buildings right and left simply exploded,\r\nand he was fending off bricks and stones and timbers. His feet were\r\nhalf buried in rubble, and he sat down on a steel girder which had\r\nlunged out into the street behind him. The dust was suffocating, the\r\nnoise was a traveling roar which went past him and on down the street\r\nbehind him. He called to a black man to dig out his feet, but the man\r\nrushed by with staring, crazy eyes. He heard screams and saw women\r\nrunning. It was some time before Red Cross stations were established\r\nand the army men rescued him.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by this earthquake, more intense than the one at\r\nCartago, was that the wooden bungalows of the hilly suburbs on rocky\r\nground stood the disaster better than even reinforced concrete in the\r\ncongested waterfront district. The better built government buildings\r\nwere preserved in part.\r\n\r\nThe Jamaica law of 1907 had established definite boundaries for wooden\r\nconstruction, limited to the suburbs, and made new and wider streets in\r\nthe business district. It had also established rigorous fire insurance\r\nlaws, and a city building code requiring specified construction for\r\nall masonry. The result was a marked ring of parkway separating the\r\ncommercial center from the dwellings in the suburbs. The trouble with\r\nsuch legislation, the effect of which I saw in Kingston twenty-six\r\nyears later, is that earthquakes are hopelessly discontinuous. With\r\nno more big earthquakes as testers, such laws become dead letter, a\r\nnew generation remembers nothing, and an irresponsible and ignorant\r\nnative population poses new problems of poverty and vice. Earthquake\r\nconstruction reform becomes an impractical dream. This is part of the\r\nunsatisfactory quality of earthquake science, where assistance to\r\nhumanity is concerned.\r\n\r\nSo ends my expedition decade, 1901 to 1910, after a succession of\r\nstudies in the field, which may be called Operation Pelée-Soufrière,\r\nOperation Vesuvius, Operation Aleutians, Operation Kilauea-Tarumai,\r\nand finally Operation Cartago. I did not think of these at the time\r\nas the strategic work of warring with a task force in geographical\r\nvolcanology; but now as I look back on it, I can see in each expedition\r\nthe organization of an institution and men, and progress of volcanic\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nThe Martinique event was destined, through many explorers, to reform\r\ngeophysics. Vesuvius introduced me to the importance of superb\r\nphotography as represented by Perret and Anderson. The Aleutian Islands\r\nintroduced the question of nautical exploration and the importance of\r\na field base laboratory for work in a land of adverse weather. The\r\nJapan-Hawaii expedition showed me the national seismometric work of Dr.\r\nOmori in the field, and laid the foundation for the Hawaiian Volcano\r\nObservatory. Finally, the Costa Rica expedition introduced me to the\r\ncomplexity of seismological field work in a land of volcanoes, with the\r\nproblems of engineering ably investigated, and afterwards published by\r\nSpofford. This decade thus logically leads into a totally different\r\none, field experiment in geography and founding a volcano observatory\r\nin and on the most active volcano in the world, with a permanent\r\ndwelling on a crater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                         Living with Volcanoes\r\n\r\n              “_He took his journey into a far country._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next decade began true experiments with volcanoes, when two\r\norganizations some 5,000 miles apart combined their resources. The\r\nWhitney Foundation created at Massachusetts Institute of Technology an\r\nendowment of $25,000 for geophysical work on earthquakes and volcanoes,\r\nexpressing a preference for work in Hawaii; and a group of businessmen\r\nin Honolulu, the Volcano Research Association, offered to pay my salary\r\nfor five years.\r\n\r\nWhen President Maclaurin and a group of professors at M. I. T. gave me\r\na dinner at the University Club in Boston to celebrate my departure for\r\nHonolulu, the dinner table conversation turned to the terrors of the\r\ndeep sea, the dangers of volcanoes, the awfulness of leprosy in Hawaii,\r\nand the heroism of giving up a secure teaching job in Boston. I replied\r\nthat their pessimism reminded me of the last words of Daniel Webster,\r\nas quoted by a New England farmer, who said “Dan’l opened his eyes,\r\ntook one look at the glass of whiskey on the table at his bedside,\r\nanother at the pretty nurse, and said ‘I ain’t dead yet.’”\r\n\r\nI had organized the funds available so that a pair of Bosch-Omori\r\nseismographs were shipped from Strassburg, and other seismographs\r\nwere ordered from Omori’s instrument maker in Tokyo. I collected\r\nexperimental instruments such as high temperature thermometers and\r\nchronographs, of the type used in experimental physiology. Vaguely,\r\nI was going to take the blood pressure and pulse of the globe. Also\r\nI obtained a full set of weather bureau instruments for temperature,\r\nrainfall, barometric pressure, and humidity, together with the electric\r\npyrometers, range finders, and photographic apparatus used in my\r\nprevious expeditions. And I had some small Japanese transits, as well\r\nas plane tables and alidades for topographic experiments.\r\n\r\nI was unable to go to Hawaii until 1912, so I was delighted when\r\nPerret consented to go to Kilauea Volcano in company with E. S.\r\nShepherd, gas chemist of the Carnegie Geophysical Laboratory of\r\nWashington, in the summer of 1911. Dr. A. L. Day, director of the\r\nCarnegie laboratory, kindly supplied at our expense two Leeds and\r\nNorthrop resistance pyrometers and the accompanying Wheatstone bridge,\r\nas well as thermocouples loaned from his equipment. Perret and Shepherd\r\nwent to Kilauea Volcano House; and Perret built a hut at the edge of\r\nHalemaumau pit, where an inner lava lake was bubbling and maintaining\r\nan island some 200 feet below the rim. Kilauea is the big cauldron,\r\nHalemaumau is the firepit in its floor. “Kilauea” activity generally\r\nmeans Halemaumau. They have separate cliff margins.\r\n\r\nL. A. Thurston, leading journalist and publicist of Hawaii and keen\r\npromoter of a proposed Hawaii National Park, did everything possible to\r\nhelp the scientists. Perret wrote weekly reports on the condition of\r\nHalemaumau lava, and sent in photographs to Mr. Thurston’s newspaper,\r\nthe _Pacific Commercial Advertiser_. Living and camping at the\r\nfire pit, Perret inaugurated something new for Hawaii, and set a\r\nstandard for the Volcano Observatory. These continuous reports had been\r\nmy dream for such volcanoes as Vesuvius, where publication had usually\r\nbeen in delayed annuals and gave no current news of what the volcano\r\nwas doing. Furthermore, the Vesuvius observatory was at the foot of the\r\npeak.\r\n\r\nI had ordered from the Lidgerwood Company an equipment of cables,\r\nincluding some containing electric wires. These were to span the 1,500\r\nfeet and to lower a thermometer into the pit of Halemaumau. Assisted by\r\nAlex Lancaster, the active little half-breed guide from Virginia, and\r\nby numerous laborers from the plantations, whose managers, spurred on\r\nby Thurston, took a great interest in the project, Perret and Shepherd\r\nerected two high A-frames on opposite sides of the fire pit and built\r\na trolley on the cable stretched between them. Perret kept constant\r\nangular measurement of the changing height of the liquid lava, as the\r\nglowing slaggy pool rose and fell overflowing its banks. At one side\r\nof a triangular island was a point of ebullition called “Old Faithful”\r\nwhere gas bubbles burst in a fiery dome, irregularly, but approximately\r\nonce a minute. The objective was to find the temperature of the liquid\r\nlava in the vicinity of the bubbling. This was achieved by actually\r\ndipping the electric pyrometers into the molten slag, then observing\r\nthe precise temperature at the recording box, which was in the hands\r\nof Dr. Shepherd, who remained on the pit rim at the upper end of the\r\nconnecting wires.\r\n\r\nFinally the day came, after numerous rehearsals, when the long steel\r\ntube, or terminal, on the end of the movable cable could be moved out\r\nby the trolley to a middle point over the pit, where it would make\r\ncontact with bubbling liquid lava when lowered. This was an extremely\r\nticklish procedure, for the lava was a heavy mat of self-crusting\r\nliquid rock with the crust forming hard slabs; few places kept up an\r\nappearance of bubbling porridge. No one had ever made contact before\r\nwith the liquid of a fountain like “Old Faithful.” It was fortunate\r\nthat the apparatus, which was expensive, consisting of platinum wires\r\nimbedded in silica glass, was made in duplicate so that we had two of\r\neverything. The splashing liquid of “Old Faithful” looked as harmless\r\nas a kettle of boiling soup, but Perret and Shepherd were in for a\r\nsurprise. When Shepherd lowered the terminal directly into the liquid,\r\n“Old Faithful” exploded, for the molten slag proved to be a suction\r\nwhirlpool which threw tentacles of lava over the steel pipe. The\r\napparatus went down to destruction “like a bass under a log,” and the\r\ncable was bitten off like a piece of line. The entire terminal vanished\r\ninto the vortex, leaving only a corroded wire.\r\n\r\nTo shorten a long story, the second terminal was lowered into a\r\nseemingly safer liquid place. A wave of the melt slapped and strained\r\nthe pipe, and though it was recovered, no electric resistance reading\r\nwas obtained at any time with the box at the rim of the pit. Close to\r\n$1,000 in equipment was lost. The resistance pyrometer is a sensitive\r\ntool in the laboratory, for giving precise degrees of temperature in\r\nthe region of 1200° Centigrade, supposedly the melting point of basalt.\r\nBut it was unsuited for the rugged bubbling of basalt slag, where\r\nflaming gases and chilling air play more important parts than mere\r\nmelting.\r\n\r\nFortunately Shepherd and Perret were not at the end of their resources.\r\nThere still remained the thermocouple, a simpler pair of wires of\r\nplatinum and iridium encased in a steel tube. The connectors from these\r\ngo to a simple galvanometer in the hands of the operator. The trolley\r\ncould still be used, and the thermocouple pipe had no glass inside it\r\nto be shattered. A temperature of 1000° Centigrade was recorded in a\r\nbubbling area, and this was considered good enough for an approximation.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment was to lower an iron bucket into the liquid, and\r\npull it up full and dripping with black lava glass. This was sent off\r\nto Washington for analysis. Afterwards the lava lake went down, no more\r\nexperiments that year were possible, and Perret began the plotting of a\r\ncurve of high and low in the rise and fall at the bottom of the pit.\r\n\r\nIt may seem extravagant to waste valuable apparatus on such seemingly\r\nsmall results; but as a matter of fact, the Shepherd-Perret journal\r\nof the summer of 1911 was epoch-making in the history of volcanology\r\nand in the work of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. It proved that\r\nskilled observers could dwell inside an active crater and there apply\r\ntheir skills in photography, chemistry, note-taking, and continuous\r\npublication. The substance of active lava lakes was proved to have\r\nviscosities and solidifications quite different from those implied\r\nby gases, and it was shown that different types of thermometers\r\ngave negative or positive results useful for the future. Above all,\r\nthe notes on volcano chemistry by Shepherd and Perret demonstrated\r\nthat engineering apparatus could be applied to the hottest and most\r\ncontinuously active pit in the world. Their success was at the\r\nrelatively small expense of a journey and a few machines. Brun of\r\nGeneva had set an example of similar work, but Perret’s curve of rise\r\nand fall added a more detailed record of the Kilauea pit from day to\r\nday than had ever been made before.\r\n\r\nAn observatory is a place of observation and measurement, whether the\r\nthings observed are glaciers, rivers, stars, the weather, or volcanoes.\r\nThe motive of observation in modern science is either the quality of\r\nwhat happens or the quantity expressed in lengths and degrees and rates\r\nof speed. Remembering the precedent of Vesuvius, I was confronted\r\nin Hawaii with the necessity of determining how a volcano should be\r\nobserved, the need to measure changes in a single volcano, and the need\r\nfor permanent records of what those changes are. We chose measuring\r\ninstruments, photographic equipment, and thermometers, and I invented a\r\nnote-taking system which was compiled into a single record book, from\r\nfield notes taken uniformly by many different assistants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _7.

Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, 1912_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _10. Jaggar in seismograph vault beneath Volcano\r\n  Observatory, 1916_]\r\n\r\nThe textbook needs for volcanology are records of the shape, height,\r\nnumber, distribution, temperature, and differences among volcanoes. How\r\ngaseous is lava? how radioactive is it? how often does it erupt? and\r\nhow dangerous is it for human beings? With reference to the source,\r\ncrack or crater, we need knowledge of how the earth crust is ruptured,\r\nhow deep are the fractures, and how much accompanied by earthquake\r\nis the wedging upward of lava in those cracks.\r\n\r\nMy first job on arriving in Hawaii was to make contact with Mr.\r\nThurston and his associates. The next was to get a good map made of\r\nKilauea Volcano as a basis for measurement of changes in the fire pit.\r\nGovernor Walter F. Frear came to my rescue and immediately sent Colonel\r\nClaude Birdseye and Captain Albert Burkland to make a topographic map\r\nof the proposed Hawaii National Park. These engineers brought into the\r\nfield the topographic camp of the U.S. Geological Survey, and they were\r\nextremely sympathetic with my project, furnishing me with surveying\r\nmonuments, and sketching out methods wherewith to make an accurate base\r\nline for measurement of changes inside the pit.\r\n\r\nA laboratory on the northeast edge of Kilauea Crater was quickly\r\nprovided through the energy of the brilliant Demosthenes Lycurgus,\r\nhospitable Greek manager of the Volcano House, the hotel where I\r\nstayed. All the merchants of Hilo, thirty miles away, contributed funds\r\nand in a few weeks carpenters were at work, on land belonging to the\r\nBishop Estate and sublet by the Volcano House. Furniture was paid for\r\nby the Whitney Fund.\r\n\r\nA cellar for seismographs was blasted by Territorial prisoners in\r\nthe hot rock under the laboratory, at the actual northeast edge\r\nof the greater crater of Kilauea. The lava pit Halemaumau, always\r\nsmoking, was in full view two miles away. The cellar lined with\r\nconcrete, which shut off the steam cracks, became a warm, dry place\r\nfor instruments at a constant temperature of about 80° Fahrenheit.\r\nConcrete tables on the floor of the cellar held the pair of east-west\r\nand north-south horizontal pendulums, recording with delicate pens\r\non smoked paper, stretched over a chronograph drum. These paper\r\nrecords, removed every day and fixed with shellac varnish, became the\r\nseismograms of the permanent files. Long belts of wavy lines on each\r\npaper exhibited seconds, minutes, and hours; and when a sharp zigzag\r\nin one of the lines occurred, it was evidence of either a local or a\r\ndistant earthquake. H. O. Wood, who had been my assistant in field\r\ngeology at Harvard and had had experience with Omori seismographs\r\nat the University of California, was summoned to the Observatory as\r\nseismologist.\r\n\r\nThus in the first six months of 1912 I became a resident of a volcano\r\nin Hawaii and had an adequate laboratory of eight rooms, and suitable\r\nporches, a darkroom for photography, and the beginnings of seismograph\r\nrecords in the basement. Horses and saddles were purchased, the\r\nnecessary outer houses were built, and Alec Lancaster was employed as\r\njanitor and field man. Francis Dodge, athletic young Honoluluan and son\r\nof a government surveyor, was appointed topographic assistant. He was a\r\nhardy cowboy, with some experience as rodman for the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of my arrival I adopted uniform pocket scratch pads\r\nwith detachable sheets for the use of all employees, insisting that\r\nanyone who went to the lava pit should write notes, inscribe the\r\ndate and hour, tell what he saw, and hand the notes to me. Even Alec\r\nLancaster, whose father was a Cherokee Indian carpenter and whose\r\nmother was a mulatto, took notes and learned about the points of the\r\ncompass and the names of the coves and blowholes of the lava lake in\r\nthe bottom of the pit. Some of Alec’s notes were very amusing, as when\r\nhe wrote, “9:30 A.M. April 3, Old Faithful is on her job right\r\nsturdy.” However, he quickly learned the correct technical expressions\r\nfor surface streaming of the lava, brightness of the fountains at\r\nnight, numbers of the bubble fountains, and places of smoke on the\r\nbottom of the pit. At all times Alec was a useful camp man, a good\r\ncook, and a fearless climber of cliffs. When it came to making and\r\nusing rope ladders with hickory rungs for descent down a 200-foot cliff\r\nto the edge of the lava, Alec was the first to volunteer. He drove\r\nspikes into cracks in the rock and tested out the ladders, surrounded\r\nby smoke. This was done in June and December of 1912, when the gas\r\nchemists of the Carnegie Institution were conducted to the bottom to\r\ncollect gases, by pumps and vacuum tubes, from flaming spatter cones.\r\n\r\nI hope this introduction gives some idea of what the first year of\r\nthe Observatory accomplished. Meanwhile problems of policy and of the\r\npublishing of results crowded upon me thick and fast. The notes of all\r\nemployees had to be compiled; critical scientific visitors had to be\r\nconvinced of the usefulness of the new effort; the Massachusetts Tech\r\nand Honolulu sponsors had to be given suitable reports; a permanent\r\nrecord book, reproducing surveys, notes, and photographs, had to be\r\ndevised; and I had to make occasional journeys to California, Boston,\r\nand Washington for contact with the Government, with scientific\r\nsocieties, and with scientific magazines.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to keep track of improvements in photographic plates,\r\nfor the fire pit with its dark red heat and dark red rocks was a\r\ndifficult subject for photography. Fortunately, the panchromatic plate\r\nhad recently been invented by Dr. C. E. K. Mees, and was a godsend for\r\nexperiments in recording liquid lava splashing at night. Dr. Mees,\r\nchief of research at Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester, has since\r\nbeen a visitor and good friend of the Observatory. Both surveying and\r\nphotographing were difficult during 1912 because the inner pit sent up\r\na dense column of fume which diminished only at those times when the\r\nliquid lava became hotter and developed fountaining. There was such\r\nsmokeless development with hundreds of roaring fountains of liquid lava\r\nin January and July. The intervening period showed a great deal of\r\nsmoke, and in August there was a dense column of silently rising gray\r\nfume the full width of the pit, so that nothing of the bottom could be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nTo determine the height of the bottom lava it was necessary to work\r\nfrom a fixed station with a transit, using a flashlight at night, and\r\nwaiting for a view of a glowing spot or fountain. This involved reading\r\nvertical and horizontal angles, dependent on difficult determination\r\nfrom two stations, of the distance to the glow spot measured. Often\r\nin daytime one had to wait hours in order to get a view of the bottom\r\nthrough the fumes, from stations at the ends of a base line on the edge\r\nof the pit. At no time later, fortunately, were the fume conditions\r\nso bad as during 1912. A procedure was adopted of making a daily\r\nphotograph of the smoke of the distant pit from the window of the\r\nobservatory, and this proved of value when the inner lava lakes and\r\ncrags rose to view in 1917.\r\n\r\nLike Perret, I made reports to the newspapers in Honolulu; and\r\ngradually these reports took the form of a monthly bulletin, edited\r\nin Honolulu by Dr. Howard Ballou, who was the secretary of the\r\nHawaiian Volcano Research Association. This association had occasional\r\nDirectors’ meetings, which I attended and before which I made reports\r\nand gave lectures. The report of the complete work done during\r\nthe first few months of the year 1912 was published in Boston by\r\nMassachusetts Tech.\r\n\r\nThe earlier history of Hawaiian volcanoes had been recorded in\r\nexcellent books by such travelers as the Misses Gordon-Cumming and\r\nIsabella Bird, William Lowthian Green, and Drs. C. H. Hitchcock and\r\nW. T. Brigham, and Professor James D. Dana of Yale. Dana had been\r\nfurnished with data from 1840 to 1890 by a Hilo missionary, Titus Coan.\r\nWhen I arrived in Hawaii, two books on Kilauea’s activity in 1909 had\r\njust been published, and a big monograph by Brun of Geneva who had\r\ndetermined that Kilauea lava was free from water vapor and was the\r\nhottest lava in the world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, R. A. Daly of Harvard had published his “Nature of\r\nvolcanic action” on the basis of his summer at Kilauea in 1909. There\r\nwas strong controversy against Brun on the water question, but the\r\nexperts, including Day and Shepherd, came to the conclusion that\r\nlava eruption of the Kilauea type was actuated by such flaming gases\r\nas hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and sulfur; that these gases were in\r\nsolution in some elemental form deep down in the earth; and that the\r\nchemistry of their emission heated the lava on its way up. The lava\r\nlakes were hotter at the top than at the bottom. We shall see that all\r\nlava partly solidifies at its own bottom and stays liquid above.\r\n\r\nThe items of activity at Kilauea Volcano during the decade from 1911 to\r\n1920 were marked fluctuation up and down in 1912–1913, with a notable\r\nlow level in 1913, culminating in a strong earthquake in October. In\r\n1914 the liquid lava came back into the bottom of Halemaumau pit, and\r\nin December Mauna Loa erupted in a fountain at its summit crater. The\r\nlava lakes of Kilauea grew bigger in 1915, and a triangular island\r\nappeared, lifting itself up from a shallow flat and even rotating or\r\nhinging horizontally. Its uplift was as a peaked escarpment of lava\r\nlayers tilted in one direction, something very like Perret’s island of\r\n1911.\r\n\r\nAn affinity between Kilauea and Mauna Loa was obvious. In 1916 Mauna\r\nLoa completed its summit gushing by splitting open the mountain’s\r\nsouthwest rift and making a lava flow into ranch and forest lands of\r\nSouth Kona. But just as Mauna Loa activity ended, the entire Halemaumau\r\nbottom thirty miles away lowered dramatically during one day, leaving a\r\ndeep seething puddle of melt, surrounded by roaring red hot avalanches.\r\nThe coincidence, along with appropriate earthquakes, was unmistakable.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the lowering, the liquid lava of Halemaumau welled up\r\nborder wall cracks and cascaded through the talus to form an oval pool\r\nin the bottom funnel of broken rock. The lava column rose 600 feet in\r\nthe next six months and a lobate lake developed, its coves separated\r\nby sectors of overflow lava which lifted slowly into crags in the\r\ncenter. In 1917 the lakes and crags inside Halemaumau were less than\r\n100 feet down, the lake shores became accessible for experiments with\r\niron pipes, and the crags came into view from the Observatory, fully\r\njustifying the daily photograph for comparing changes of the distant\r\npit.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _11. Lava lake, showing bench, March 30,\r\n  1917_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _12. Halemaumau, showing lava lake and crags,\r\n  December 8, 1916_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _13. Jaggar holding pipe for sounding lava lake,\r\n  1917. Cylinder on end of pipe holds Seger cones for measuring\r\n  lava temperature_]\r\n\r\nBy 1918 and 1919 the pit was full and overflowing the Kilauea floor.\r\nDuring the whole of 1919 Halemaumau, as a pit, was obliterated by its\r\ndome of fill. In autumn the south flank of Mauna Loa broke out again,\r\ninto a flood of lava that reached the sea in South Kona. Remembering\r\n1916, we predicted that, even though Halemaumau was full to the brim,\r\nthe sinking away of Mauna Loa lava would pull down Kilauea lava\r\nsuddenly, like a siphon. Exactly this happened on November 28, 1919.\r\nDuring the night the crags, the clover-leaf lake, and the bulging\r\ndome of the lava fill above Halemaumau’s edge went down as a cylinder\r\nto a depth of 400 feet in two or three hours leaving incandescent\r\navalanching walls, a gratifying confirmation of theory.\r\n\r\nAs in 1916, the Halemaumau lava immediately returned to the bottom of\r\nthe pit, and lifted itself thirty feet a day for three weeks, so that\r\nin December it was a violently boiling ringshaped puddle, surrounding\r\na horseshoe of crags with a quiet inner lagoon and resembling a coral\r\natoll. The Kilauea floor, which is dome-shaped outside of Halemaumau,\r\nsplit open radially to the south, made floods of lava into the Kilauea\r\nCrater wall valley, and even escaped out into the Kau Desert. This was\r\nextended into a mountain crack, making flank lava flows of Kilauea\r\nMountain, nine miles away to the southwest, something which had not\r\nhappened since 1823 and 1868. Concentric craters like Kilauea caldera\r\nand Halemaumau pit are thus ring-in-ring, or cup-in-cup, structures\r\nby means of slag heapings over a deep fracture in the rock crust, the\r\ncircularity determined by occasional central sinking.\r\n\r\nThis circularity has sometimes reached perfection. In 1894 and 1909\r\nthe liquid pool inside Halemaumau, by steady welling up about a\r\ncentral hole, became perfectly circular within a circumferential\r\nrampart of overflow. This is a rare condition dependent on steadiness\r\nof upwelling, temperature, and viscosity. It is important because it\r\nshows how the perfect circles, and rampart cauldrons, were made on the\r\nmoon, where there are also angular calderas of subsidence like Kilauea\r\nCrater. Evidently gas heating and liquidity changed on the moon, just\r\nas it has done in Hawaii. The sources there are over cracks, as in\r\nHawaii. The analogies are so complete in these and many other ways that\r\nI completely disbelieve in meteor impact for the moon craters. The moon\r\nawaits a complete comparison with active terrestrial basaltic lavas,\r\nby a modern volcanologist.\r\n\r\nThis is only a thumbnail sketch of the astonishing luck which met the\r\nphotographers and note takers of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory\r\nin its first decade. There were similar decades in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and there were similar jagged crags rising as islands and\r\nshorelines around clover-leaf lakes in 1879 and at other times. There\r\nwere undoubtedly earlier similar sympathetic movements whereby Kilauea\r\nhad lowered following the end of Mauna Loa outbreaks. But none of this\r\nhad ever before been measured from day to day. Our staff from 1912\r\non occupied the trig stations, every day or night when the weather\r\npermitted, in order to measure within one foot the level of the live\r\nlava up or down. The lava was like the mercury in a barometer and\r\nneeded incessant watching. This was done with a telescope, by people\r\nwho dwelt on the edge of the vertical pipe. After 1913 the measurements\r\nclearly showed that sinkings were just as important as risings. They\r\nproved that the solid overflow matter and slide-rock slopes around the\r\nedges of lava lakes and coves measurably were a paste. This containing\r\nbank rose and fell at a different rate from that of the gassy liquid\r\nwhich streamed and fountained inside. The compiled results showed that\r\nthe source of the liquid streaming was always at the west side of the\r\npit bottom and that the streaming was toward fountaining grottos at\r\nthe east. The liquid might at any time overflow its banks or sink down\r\nleaving inner cliffs, by failure of full supply up the west wall crack.\r\n\r\nAll of this may sound highly technical; but notes, photographs,\r\nseismograms, records of weather, and unceasing press releases and\r\nreports to the sponsors, while difficult for literary description,\r\ncreated a new technique. Science, when one is devising a new approach,\r\nconsists of observation first, of experiment second, and of explanation\r\nor theory third. Something of that order has to be followed in the\r\nrecord of a scientist’s life.\r\n\r\nThe surprising sympathetic lowering of Kilauea following the end of\r\nMauna Loa eruptions was only one of numerous surprises during the first\r\ndecade of the Observatory. For instance, the temperatures of hot cracks\r\nwere repeatedly and systematically measured, and nothing sympathetic\r\nwith lava motion was found. The same may be said about the weather.\r\nAt the beginning it was supposed that rainfall, air temperature,\r\nbarometric pressure, and possibly fluctuation of the trade wind, would\r\naffect the volcano. However, the only quickly evident effect was the\r\nvisible vaporing of many cracks on the Kilauea floor which dried up and\r\ndiminished when the sunshine appeared, becoming dense and increasing\r\nin cold or wet weather. This obviously meant that the moisture content\r\nof the vaporing cracks, some steam, but mostly moist hot air came from\r\nshallow rain water a short distance underground.\r\n\r\nAn effect that was more volcanic, but similar in principle, was the\r\nvisible vapor inside of Halemaumau, close to the lava lakes, which\r\nalways increased when the lava lowered and let the groundwater seep\r\ninward. These visible vapors dwindled when the hot slag bubbled and\r\nrose, and acquired a brighter glow. No steam vapor rose from the\r\nglowing lakes. There was drying up of groundwater by increased volcanic\r\nheat, just as the cracks of the bigger crater had their moisture dried\r\nby the action of sunshine.\r\n\r\nI shall have more to say on the subject of the seasons, the calendar\r\neffects on the plat of rising and falling lava, and especially the\r\nsolar equinoxes and solstices. There appeared the hint of a daily\r\ntide-like rise and fall of the lava in the pit.\r\n\r\nFinally, there arose the question of counting earthquakes, measuring\r\ntheir spacing in time and place, and seeing which belonged to Mauna Loa\r\nand which to Kilauea fault rifts. We had to plot earthquake frequency\r\nand size in relation to lowering lava, to day and night or to the\r\nseasons. The study of rhythmic swelling and creaking inside the great\r\npasty mountains became an exciting quest. It gave promise of cycles\r\nfrom the hours of the day to the decades of the century.\r\n\r\nWe also discovered, by measuring vertical angles, that the inner floors\r\nrose and fell differently from the liquid lakes, hence the floors\r\ncould be called the bench magma, as distinct from the liquid magma.\r\nThis led to a bold experiment in 1917 when the liquid lava lakes\r\nbecame accessible, after a casual visitor, Mr. Walter Spalding of\r\nHonolulu, discovered an easy path down to the overflow floors at the\r\nedge of the north lake. Here the streaming slag rushed toward a glowing\r\ngrotto, built up by spatter of a border fountain into a huge half-dome\r\ncontaining a glowing cavern hung with stalactites on the shore of the\r\nlake. The platform outside of the grotto was overflowed, and built up\r\nas the liquid lake rose, the platforms of overflow sloping away to\r\nthe wall valley under the pit cliff. Thus the lake was at the top of\r\nan inner dome a thousand feet across, just as Halemaumau pit rim was\r\nat the top of an inner dome of Kilauea floor three miles across. The\r\nouter edge of Kilauea Crater is a big oval at the top of the outward\r\nsloping greater dome of Kilauea Mountain forty or fifty miles across.\r\n\r\nWhen a little conelet formed on the northern or western floor platform\r\ninside Halemaumau, its slope around a splashing and fountaining crack\r\nwould make a fourth innermost dome a few feet across in the series\r\nof progressively smaller cone-in-cone structures from the outer rim\r\nof the big mountain inward to the Halemaumau centers of eruption. We\r\nsaw such a conelet cave in just where I had stood and tested a flame\r\nthe day before. Quietly the cone collapsed into a fountaining well of\r\nboiling lava beneath. The ring-in-ring conception must be held in mind\r\nwith regard to any volcano, for one thing which we discovered is that\r\ncones are not only built up and collapsed but they are also swollen\r\nup by internal percolation of cracks and expansion of the hot stuff.\r\nThis tumefying, or swelling, is concerned with the experiment now to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nEven after Perret described his “floating island” of 1911 and I saw the\r\ntriangular islands appearing like shoals in a mud flat and gradually\r\nrising into crags in 1916 and 1917, I remained incredulous of the\r\npossibility of a basaltic island floating. When solid lava cracked\r\noff in pieces from inner cliffs around the lava lakes, the fragments\r\nimmediately sank. Furthermore, when solid crusts formed on top of the\r\nfoaming and streaming slag, the shells, when they got thick enough,\r\ncracked up, tilted up, and slid down and foundered in the melt beneath.\r\nIt was obvious that lava rock is heavier than lava foam. Hence as an\r\nisland is a rock, it would not float. This raised several questions.\r\nWhere was the bottom of the lava lake on which it rested? Did the lava\r\nlake have a bottom, and if so how far down was the bottom when the same\r\nlake rose 600 feet in Halemaumau pit between June and December of 1916?\r\nIn other words, was the lake 600 feet deep in December?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the answer at any time if a stiff iron pipe were thrust\r\ndown vertically into the liquid lake as a sounding rod? No one had ever\r\nraised the question. Cross-section drawings had always depicted the\r\nliquid as extending downward indefinitely within a vertical tube. When\r\nthe lake became accessible in 1917, it seemed to me that a long steel\r\npipe might be shoved over the border rampart, end on, and allowed to\r\nbend and sink, or to strike bottom. If the pipe could be recovered by\r\ndragging it back, fusible samples of known melting point might show the\r\ntemperature of the depths.\r\n\r\nFor the experiment, 200 feet of one-inch iron pipe, which was screwed\r\ntogether in a single long piece, was laid across the north floor of\r\nHalemaumau. Ten assistants were distributed along the pipe twenty feet\r\napart, and I stood on the rampart with Alec at the edge of the central\r\nportion of the lava lake. This was a high bank ten feet or more above\r\nthe streaming liquid lava. The men were instructed to lift the entire\r\nlong tube and walk forward with it, so that it would plunge into the\r\nliquid lengthwise, arching down toward the center of the lake as it\r\ncame past me. Alec helped guide the pipe over the bank, and the men\r\ncame forward with it at a steady walk. The end of the pipe, covered\r\nwith a screw cap, was plunged into the liquid lava, traveling toward\r\nthe bottom at a good speed. The strong current toward the left dragged\r\nit somewhat, but not enough to prevent its sinking. After two and\r\na half 20-foot joints of the pipe had plunged into the liquid at a\r\nslope of about fifty degrees, I could feel the pipe encountering the\r\nincreasing resistance of a pasty bottom. Continued forward progress of\r\nthe pipe caused it to stop and arch up, while the surface lava streamed\r\npast it, and its lower end was definitely stuck in the bottom substance\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\nI then gave the signal to the carriers to try to walk back to the\r\nplace where they had started, with a view to pulling the pipe up and\r\nrecovering the terminal length. The pipe trailed upward out of the lava\r\nlake like a red hot rope, then stuck and refused to come out. It came\r\nclose against the bank where it was frozen solid in the stiff blankets\r\nof pahoehoe crust, which gripped it like hot iron.\r\n\r\nThe terminal length had been equipped internally with a spiral of\r\nspring steel, containing Seger cones which are used in the porcelain\r\nindustry and which bear numbers indicating they melt at graded\r\ntemperatures. This first thermometer by meltability was never\r\nrecovered. The free lengths of pipe had to be unscrewed close to the\r\nbank, and four twenty-foot lengths were lost. In later tests we learned\r\nto keep the pipe oscillating back and forth so it would not freeze.\r\n\r\nThe epoch-making significance of this experiment was not understood\r\nuntil later. Calculation of the angle of slope of the pipe, where it\r\nwent down into the liquid and hit on the bottom, showed that vertically\r\nthe liquid was about fifty feet deep. With the aid of soldiers from the\r\nKilauea Military Camp, this experiment was repeated several times; and\r\neach time the lake was found to be the same depth.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was later verified by sudden subsidences of the liquid\r\nlava until the cliffs bordering the liquid were fifty feet high. The\r\neastern grottos turned into cascades, with the liquid pouring down\r\na well. The liquid lake had become a river pouring over a ledge of\r\nits own bottom, across from the western source wells to the eastern\r\nsinkholes. These latter were fountaining grottos when the lakes were\r\nfull, but they exhibited internal rectangular upright sinkholes\r\nwhen the lake level was down. This was verified repeatedly, and the\r\nphenomena of source wells at the west and cascading sinkholes at the\r\neast were confirmed and photographed. It thus became evident that the\r\nlava lakes were nothing more than convectional lava flows over pasty\r\nsolidified substance of their own bottom sediment. Convection means\r\nrising foam, loss of gas, and sinking gas-free heavier liquid.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the bench magma capped with overflows on the marginal\r\nplatforms was a paste, cooled from the top and bottom and sides\r\nand making the saucer of streaming liquid. It was this paste which\r\nconstituted the swelling heart of the bench magma. The fountaining of\r\ngas bubbles escaping from solution robbed the lava of heat and caused\r\nit partially to solidify, always at a depth of about fifty feet. Thus\r\nthere were necessarily three substances: The deep lava fizzing with\r\nself-heating gases (later proved to be inflammable hydrogen, carbon\r\nmonoxide, sulfur, and inert nitrogen and argon), the streaming foam\r\ninto which the deep lava expanded, and the semi-solidified refuse of\r\nthe foam created at the bottoms and banks of the liquid lava when it\r\ncooled from bright yellow heat (about 1150° Centigrade) to a dark-red\r\nheat (about 900° Centigrade).\r\n\r\nThe streaming across the bottom from west to east meant that during six\r\nmonths of rising lava, some 600 feet in the last half of 1916, the lava\r\ncolumn was a cylinder of semicooled lava, maintained by upward pressure\r\nof the deep lava bubbling up in the western crack between the cylinder\r\nand Halemaumau wall. Meanwhile, at all times, the lakes were nothing\r\nmore than streams of foam fifty feet deep and skinned over on top,\r\ncongealing on their bottoms and shores and cascading down sinkholes in\r\nthe eastern wall cracks of the cylinder. A convectional circulation\r\nwas what maintained the rising, foaming, heating, and cooling and the\r\nchanges in density of the liquid as it lost its gas. Thus the entire\r\nfountaining phenomenon of the lava lakes was due to the self-heating\r\nof what is known as exothermic reaction of gas escaping from solution\r\nin molten basalt. Much of this is actually the burning of hydrogen in\r\nair, creating a convectional circulation wherever the deep lava can\r\nfind an outlet.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily these outlets are along cracks or rifts in the slope of the\r\nmountain, where they are seen to break out in gassy fountains 500 feet\r\nhigh, and often to flow along the crack to a cavity where they cascade\r\ndownward when less foamy and heavier. A lava flow is always solving a\r\nproblem of foaming and liquefying, just as does champagne or beer.\r\n\r\nThere still remains the unsolved problems of how much of the deep\r\nlava is gas and whether it is mere pressure which holds the gases in\r\nsolution, as in soda water. The alternative is for the deeper magma\r\nto be entirely gas, oozing up cracks in the globe, and reacting with\r\noxygen from the air and solid rock, percolating from the core of the\r\nearth upward, and melting its walls.\r\n\r\nIn a sense, the entire decade to 1920 was an experiment. The results\r\nof that decade showed that the mountain swells and shrinks in tides\r\nwith the passages of the sun and moon, but that Kilauea Mountain and\r\nMauna Loa Mountain are all parts of what might be called Hawaii Island\r\nMountain. The island of Hawaii is above an old ocean bottom 18,000\r\nfeet deep and is only the end of a ridge 1,700 miles long, which even\r\nat its lowest end, Midway and Ocean Islands, is still 12,000 feet high\r\nabove the smooth mud-over-rock ball of the Pacific Ocean bottom. All\r\nthe evidence shows the ridge to be a pile of lava flows over a crack,\r\nwith a veneer of coral. If, then, the relatively small Kilauea dome\r\nis swelling and shrinking in sympathy with the sun, the long Hawaiian\r\nridge is doing the same thing to a much greater degree.\r\n\r\nMichelson has shown that the solid rock of the globe rises and falls\r\nin a tide about one foot every half day. As I have said, our daily\r\nmeasurements in 1912 showed that the lava in Halemaumau had a daily\r\ntide and that the larger movements reached maxima in June and December\r\nand minima in the intervening months, which proved it must be a solar\r\neffect. This was very exciting information and suggested a long train\r\nof experiments, which were to be successful in the next decade, based\r\non the idea that the whole mountain swells as shown by leveling. This\r\nextends out to a radius of twenty miles from Kilauea Crater, and\r\nprobably extends all the way to the seashore.\r\n\r\nThe actual measurement of a lava tide in Halemaumau was done during\r\nJuly and August 1919. R. H. Finch had just come from Washington to be\r\nmy assistant. Oliver Emerson of Honolulu was another assistant, and two\r\nHarvard youths, Sumner Roberts and Charles Thorndike, who had been on\r\nwar missions in submarine chasers, sent word through their parents that\r\nthey were anxious to do something dangerous around an active volcano. I\r\njumped at the chance to employ them to help me measure the lava tide.\r\n\r\nThe north lake in Halemaumau was quite accessible, and we organized\r\nnight and day shifts for surveying measurements from a canvas shelter\r\non the actual bench lava near the lake. For twenty-minute periods, each\r\nobserver critically measured a number of monuments on the bench magma\r\nand glowing places of the lake edge. Then a new measurement was started\r\nby leveling the transit. This sequence was kept up night and day for a\r\nlunar month, namely twenty-eight days. One of the monuments was a fixed\r\nHalemaumau benchmark, equipped at night with a lantern and used as a\r\ndatum for the fluctuating lake points.\r\n\r\nA second tent back from the Halemaumau rim was a camping base. Ford\r\ncars were kept running from the Volcano House for the changing of crew,\r\nMrs. Jaggar looked out for the food, and I directed repeated surveys of\r\nthe position of monuments and of the observation shelter.\r\n\r\nMeantime the lava steadily rose during July, and at one time split\r\nopen the Kilauea floor making an outflow back of the shelter. The\r\nvertical angles kept track of the movements of both the liquid and the\r\nsemisolid lava. The instrument was planted on the lava column itself.\r\nOn one occasion, Mrs. Jaggar’s glove fell into a floor crack inside the\r\nshelter and burst into flame.\r\n\r\nIn all, there were more than 20,000 observations recorded. These were\r\nplotted on coordinate paper, and results were reduced to a smooth\r\ncurve by overlapping averages. The actual curve of measurements was\r\nsubjected to harmonic analysis at Yale University by Professor E. W.\r\nBrown, mathematician and specialist on motion of the moon and on lunar\r\ntides. The results showed a definite daily tide in both liquid lava\r\nand semisolid lava; of a few inches for the lunar tide, and of larger\r\namounts for the solar effect. The curve plotted reached its greatest\r\nperfection of daily up-and-down waves during July at periods when the\r\nlava was steady. This became interrupted and ragged when accidents of\r\ndrainage out on Kilauea floor pulled the liquid lava down.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _14.

Wood, seismologist at the Volcano Observatory, was skilled in\r\ncompiling the volcano’s historical heights and depths of the nineteenth\r\ncentury and in plotting our curve of surveys of the liquid lava. He\r\npublished a commentary on such plots for 1912–1913 in relation to\r\nsolar curves of solstice and equinox, and to the oscillations of the\r\nglobal axis. He demonstrated a definite correlation between seasonal\r\nfluctuation of sun and moon and the seasonal rise and fall of the lava,\r\npresenting an extensive analysis of the rock tide in the globe and its\r\napplication to Hawaiian volcanoes for a century. Perret had made a\r\nsimilar analysis for earthquakes and volcanoes in Italy.\r\n\r\nThese curves applied to the seasons, if compared with our lava tide\r\napplied to the hours of the day, left me with the conviction that the\r\ncyclical variations are a fact. They show correspondence between the\r\nswelling and shrinking of the globe and the movements of lava, when\r\nthose movements are free and subject to surveying measurements. For few\r\nvolcanoes are surveys possible, and our measurements were the first in\r\nthe world of any continuity.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, too, were studied. Dr. Arnold Romberg of the University\r\nof Texas--who has become a distinguished inventor in the world of\r\nseismology, magnetism, gravity, and oil prospecting--was Professor\r\nof Physics at the University of Hawaii about 1918 and for several\r\nsummers came to the Hawaiian Observatory to assist me in experimental\r\nseismology.\r\n\r\nFrom 1917 to 1920 I took the records of earthquakes and other seismic\r\nmovements, as recorded by our Omori instruments, and Romberg remodelled\r\nthese instruments. With his knowledge of the fundamental mathematics\r\nof pendulums, for at Harvard he had experimented with sensitive\r\ngalvanometers, his facility for making instruments out of nothing but\r\nwire, solder, and old clockworks was wonderful and inspiring.\r\n\r\nI spent many months measuring our smoked-paper seismograms of 1913\r\nthrough 1918, with the assistance of Mrs. Jaggar, to whom I dictated. I\r\nmeasured types of local earthquakes, of volcanic tremors (some of which\r\ndefinitely accompany lava fountaining), and tilting of the ground,\r\npublishing the results in 1920. Tilt upswelling is shown in amount and\r\ndirection by gradual change of the writing seismograph pens, and this\r\nis correlated with the recorded rise and fall of the lava.\r\n\r\nIn the course of three years, with Romberg’s valuable advice, we\r\nchanged the seismographs to record with little mirrors supported on\r\nsilken fibers and with beams of light projected on photographic paper.\r\nAnd Romberg invented an ingenious improvement with a vane and a bath of\r\noil, whereby a tilt-free seismograph for earthquakes only would keep\r\nthe spacing of its lines uniform. Ground tilt crowds the lines.\r\n\r\nWe also experimented with a heavy cylinder which hung as a normal\r\npendulum and which was capable of swinging in any direction, so that\r\nit threw a beam of light vertically upward to a chronograph covered\r\nwith bromide paper. The chronograph was capable of being revolved and\r\nstopped, until the mocroseisms and microtremors reached their maximum\r\nof amplitude, for any given period of recording.\r\n\r\nThe permanent waviness of ground motion, the tremors with periods of\r\nabout two-tenths of a second, and the microseisms with periods of\r\nabout five seconds showed their maxima of back-and-forth movement\r\nwhen the chronograph was revolved to a position where the pendulum\r\nswung northeast-southwest. This northeast-southwest tendency was found\r\nto be a characteristic of the seismograph cellar for many seismic\r\nmeasurements, including local earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThis was the direction at right angles to the edge of the cliff\r\non which the Observatory stood. We concluded that this motion was\r\ncharacteristic of the upright flat slabs, with cracks behind them,\r\nwhich constitute the face of the crater cliff, and decided that any\r\nmotion communicated to these slabs would tend to be a swaying toward\r\nthe crater, rather than in the direction of stiffness parallel to the\r\ncrater’s edge. Omori has found a similar permanent tendency for Tokyo\r\ncity, where the directions are northwest and southeast for maximum\r\namplitude. This means that any spot on earth oscillates easiest in one\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nThese first ten years of the Observatory answered many questions and\r\npointed the way for future experiment and study. It now appears that\r\nliquid lava is a gas froth, that Kilauea and Mauna Loa are all one\r\nsystem, that hydrogen is the most elemental gas in eruption, that a\r\ngas-free paste is the residue of flowing foam both in pits and lava\r\nflows, that earthquakes and vibrations are a function of this paste\r\nwedging up cracks and sinking back underground, and that the rise and\r\nfall is in tides and cycles, short and long. These things are not\r\nguesses, but measurements.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake problem at volcanoes is misunderstood in geology. The\r\nsuperstition that volcanic quakes are small is wrong. “Volcanic” in\r\nvolcanology is not limited to volcanoes. Los Angeles, Charleston,\r\nLisbon, and the deep ocean bottom are all volcanic, are all tremulous;\r\nand all have “lava” underneath. Kilauea and Midway Island are one, Rome\r\nand Etna are one, Iceland and St. Helena are one, Redlands and Mount\r\nRainier are one, and the paste is underneath. These facts concern the\r\nglobe, not a little bundle of wrinkles like the Alps.\r\n\r\nWe do not know what an earthquake is or what lava is. However, “lava”\r\nfalling suddenly and rising slowly with big and few earthquakes\r\naccompanying fall, and little and many earthquakes appearing with\r\nrise, are facts observed at Kilauea. At Tokyo in 1923 the greatest\r\nquake in history centered at lowered lava and lowered sea-bottom next\r\nto Oshima Volcano island. The Messina quake in 1908 made a hissing\r\nnoise, and nearby Etna lava was low. There are long cracks in the earth\r\nshell somewhere deep down, and we know little about them except that\r\nvolcanoes and faults are in lines. So long as the three-quarters of\r\nthe globe under oceans are unexplored by man, with no rock specimens\r\nor even decent maps, and so long as there are no instruments planted\r\non sea bottoms, we cannot use the term volcanic intelligently. Most\r\nvolcanoes of the earth are undiscovered. Kilauea measurements whet\r\nthe appetite for a new scientific frontier, the prospecting for ores,\r\nvolcanoes, and mountains under the sea. The absence of core drilling\r\nand rock sampling over three-quarters of the earth is a disgrace to the\r\noil-drilling and quarrying sciences of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe founding decade of the Hawaiian Observatory produced two effective\r\nexpeditions, one to Japan and one to New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe Research Association voted to send me to Kagoshima in Kyushu, the\r\nsouth island of Japan, where the volcano Sakurajima made earthquakes,\r\nexplosions, and lava flows in January of 1914. About the same time\r\nPerret was sent to Sakurajima by Friedlaender of Naples, so we met in\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nSakurajima, or Cherry Island, is a 4,000-foot cone in Kagoshima Sound,\r\na deep inlet at the southernmost end of Kyushu. The volcano threatened\r\n22,000 persons in villages on Sakurajima Island itself, and 70,000\r\nin Kagoshima. It is a land of orange groves, fisherfolk, Satsuma\r\nporcelain, and maritime commerce, situated at the north end of the\r\nOkinawa-Ryukyu islands, a volcano chain extending north to Nagasaki.\r\n\r\nAuthorities in Kagoshima knew all about Pelée; and the army, navy,\r\nand governor wasted no time. Professor Omori, who had a seismograph\r\nat the weather station of Kagoshima, went at once to the volcano, and\r\nprofiting from the lesson of Pelée, guided the lives of 90,000 persons.\r\n\r\nThe Sakurajima eruption began on a Saturday and Sunday with hundreds\r\nof earthquakes locally identified as coming from the volcano. Public\r\nand private vessels were called into service to move all the people of\r\nthe island over to Kagoshima and beyond. With a general of the army in\r\ncommand, this was accomplished in two days. On Monday at ten o’clock\r\nthe great, picturesque peak, quite like Pelée or Vesuvius, suddenly\r\nejected vertically and quietly, from a crack in its flank, a column of\r\n“smoke” 30,000 feet high. This was answered by another, similar column\r\non the opposite side of the mountain; and the two columns joined above\r\ninto a colossal arch of cauliflower clouds consisting of sand, dust,\r\nand boulders. The crack in the mountain which gave vent to all this\r\nopened with slight rumble and behaved like two radial ruptures meeting\r\ntoward the peak, extending southwest and southeast. The sector of the\r\nmountain between them appeared to have been lifted like a piece of pie\r\nshoved up in the center. But the summit craters played no appreciable\r\npart in the eruption, unless it was a gush of steam on Sunday evening.\r\nThe line of craterlets along the cracks and only half way up the\r\nmountain quickly developed lava flows, and these poured down, the one\r\ntoward Kagoshima Strait, the other toward the narrow Osumi Strait,\r\nwhich separated the volcano from the wilder eastern mainland. This\r\nstrait was filled up with heavy block lava, or aa, converting the\r\nisland into a peninsula. A similar aa lava flow, fifty feet high in\r\nfront, swept down to the beach on the Kagoshima side, with boulders as\r\nbig as a house tumbling over its andesite front.\r\n\r\nTidal waves made by these two lava flows entering the sea were small\r\nbut perceptible. The principal effect was thousands of white steam jets\r\nwhere the red hot blocks entered the ocean. Culmination of glowing heat\r\ncame the second night, Tuesday. The flows continued for months, but the\r\nmaximum of seismic effect had happened at six o’clock in the evening of\r\nthe first day, Monday.\r\n\r\nThis was a really big earthquake damaging masonry and causing landslips\r\nfrom the cliff next to Kagoshima city and killing a number of people.\r\nThe flux of refugees from the volcano villages on Monday was a\r\ndramatic event. When the lava outbreak occurred in the forenoon,\r\nthe schools sent the children home. On their way, the children gazed\r\nentranced toward the terrific arch of cloud over the mountain, vomiting\r\ntrajectories of stones. Shops closed, and the city was quiet while\r\neverybody sized up the crisis. As a schoolboy in English class wrote,\r\n“Monster rocks went horizontally from the down to the up, with smokes\r\non their behind.”\r\n\r\nAfter the evening earthquake, however, when many buildings had shaken\r\ndown, all except public officials were ordered to leave for the back\r\ncountry. Young men’s clubs organized to receive the refugees along\r\nthe roads which led into the interior of Satsuma province, while\r\ntemples and schoolhouses were impressed into service to house them.\r\nThe migration of more than 50,000 people with packs on their backs and\r\nwith handcarts bearing household goods, demonstrated how easily the\r\nJapanese people took to a nomad existence. This hegira came to an end\r\non Wednesday, when Dr. Omori arrived from Tokyo, sized up the seismic\r\nrecord and the fiery crisis of Tuesday night, and took the grave\r\nresponsibility of announcing that the population of Kagoshima might\r\nsafely return. This was done, he was right, and no further damage beset\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nThrough all of this eruption, so different from Pelée in administrative\r\ncontrol, no one was killed by the volcano, though one or two old people\r\ndied of shock. One old lady who refused to leave her home on the island\r\nsurvived. Village roofs were bent down, crushed, and half buried under\r\na heavy snowfall of ash, and it was notable that flat-roofed cottages\r\nwere crushed, whereas those with steeper roofs were less damaged.\r\nOrange orchards were hopelessly destroyed.\r\n\r\nAt the west shore of Sakurajima in a place called Hakamagoshi, a fiery\r\nblast rushed down to the sea from the rift. Trees were stripped of\r\nlimbs and bark, saplings were bent away from the volcano, and wood\r\nfiber on stumps was shredded by flying rocks. This blast was very short\r\nlived and never reached across to the city. It bore the marks of being\r\nsimilar to the downblasts of Mount Pelée. The lava flows kept on for a\r\nyear and built new shore islands.\r\n\r\nI had the remarkable experience of being rowed in a skiff over the\r\nsubmerged tongue of an eastern flow, trailing a thermometer in the\r\nincreasingly boiling water. When the steaming water about us reached\r\nscalding temperature, we had the unpleasant thought that if we should\r\ncapsize we would be cooked. We found boiled horses and cattle along the\r\nbeaches, and thousands of dead fish. A climb near the eastern flank\r\nvent showed a portion of the moving lava flow pouring down the slope\r\ninto a glowing cavern under a shell of its own bouldery texture.\r\n\r\nThe thousands of dollars of relief which came to Japan from America and\r\nelsewhere were handled with scrupulous honesty, and the inhabitants of\r\nthe island were rehabilitated on Tanegashima, another island of the\r\nRyukyu Archipelago.\r\n\r\nScientific investigations showed by leveling that the mountain had\r\nbeen lifted a few feet by the internal penetration of the lava, and\r\nreexamination of the benchmarks along roads extending out radially\r\nindicated that the north end of the bay bottom and shore had definitely\r\nsunk, as though underground lava had been withdrawn from that region,\r\nto push up, swell, and overflow the mountain. This effect of subsidence\r\noutside was traced and shown to gradually lessen for a hundred miles\r\nfrom the place of greatest sinking. Investigation carried out by the\r\ngeologist colleagues of Omori culminated in a monumental publication\r\nwhich demonstrates the solidarity of the Japanese methods of science.\r\nAnd both Omori and Professor Koto published books on Sakurajima in\r\nEnglish, with maps, photographs, curves, and seismograms.\r\n\r\nOmori, in 1910, had anticipated movement of the earth about a volcanic\r\ncenter as swelling up one place and sinking down in another while\r\neruption was going on. At that time, he described Usu Volcano at\r\nthe opposite end of Japan, where leveling instruments showed graded\r\nchanges in height made by the Usu eruption. A remarkable physiographic\r\ncharacter of Usu Mountain, and of the adjacent basin of Lake Toya,\r\nis that basin and dome appear complementary, just as Kagoshima Bay\r\nwas compensated by Sakurajima. This same pairing of lake with volcano\r\nhas been noted in other parts of Japan, as though tumefaction by\r\nlava penetration and lava eruption had robbed the underpinning of an\r\nadjacent piece of ground, which lowered and became a lake by filling up\r\nwith groundwater.\r\n\r\nFrom Sakurajima I went to Bandaisan, or Kobandai, a famous volcano in\r\ncentral Japan northwest of Tokyo and on the shore of a beautiful lake.\r\nIt looks like an ordinary rocky peak, but its fame was made by a steam\r\nexplosion from its flank which blew out the side of the mountain and\r\nleft avast sulfurous quarry with numerous solfataras and hot springs.\r\nBandai was known by geologists to be one of a chain of volcanoes, but\r\nprior to 1885 its activity was in question. One morning the sky was\r\ndarkened by the overwhelming explosion, and vast volumes of rock from\r\nthe outbreak poured down as a landslide and completely dammed a river\r\nsystem. It left extraordinary little heaps in the new dammed up lake.\r\nThese appeared to be individual blocks of rock against which heaps of\r\ndebris were piled so as to leave pyramidal humps scattered over the\r\nsurface of the impounded water near the volcano. An excellent report in\r\nEnglish on this eruption was published at the time, and the eruption\r\nbecame the type of what geologists call a phreatic explosion, meaning\r\npure steam. There was doubt as to whether any fragments of new lava\r\nwere thrown up.\r\n\r\nI took with me to Bandaisan a photographer-guide. We camped in a\r\nmountain inn with thatched roof, visited a hot spring resort, and hiked\r\nto the crater where we measured temperatures and took photographs. It\r\nwas a vast flat-floored shelf, dug out of the side of the mountain,\r\nwith steam jets and puddles of boiling water at the back. Looking out\r\nat the new water-filled valley with its many islands at the base of\r\nthe slope below the crater, we could see shoreline levels higher than\r\nthe present beach, where the damming had produced the highest stand of\r\nthe water. The eruption and landslide overwhelmed villages and killed\r\nmany people, though it lasted only a few days. It was on the side\r\nof the mountain remote from the older lake. In clambering over the\r\nbroken debris, which looked more like glacial deposits than volcanic\r\nagglomerate, I picked up some pieces of vesicular basalt that were\r\ndefinitely lava. Wada, a Japanese geologist, had found the same thing,\r\nand we both concluded that these were an internal live basalt blown to\r\nfragments in the Bandaisan eruption, but that most of the material was\r\nfrom the shattered old mountain.\r\n\r\nMy interpretation of Bandaisan is that it is an old volcano in the\r\nline of Asama and other volcanoes of central Japan, and that the line\r\nis a deep crack always full of lava in the depths, which is selective\r\nof outlet, depending upon what part of the crack opens as the path of\r\nleast resistance. Eruption may be occasioned by lava wedging upward at\r\none volcano, or by lava sinking downward at another volcano, according\r\nto the way the medial rift of continental Honshu is warped and stressed\r\nby the earthquake forces. One part of a volcano chain is always\r\nsinking, with lava withdrawn. Another part is always swelling up, with\r\nlava penetrating the cracks under active crater pits, like that of\r\nAsama.\r\n\r\nAsama is the Vesuvius of central Japan near the village of Karuizawa,\r\nfamous as the resort of American missionaries. Bandaisan is one of a\r\nline of volcanic peaks north of Asama, all of which have hot springs\r\nand solfataras. The explosion of Bandaisan, where the big natural lake\r\nrepresents the groundwater level of abundant rainfall, occurred when\r\nthe underground lava column suddenly sank rapidly by the gaping open\r\nof the deep rift. The water poured into red hot cavities, while the\r\nlava was rising and erupting by frothing up in the depths of one of\r\nthe other volcanoes. The results of Bandai’s explosion were first,\r\nearthquake collapse, which was assisted by vast outjets of boiling\r\nsteam from groundwater, and then the blowing out of the mountainside.\r\n\r\nOf special interest is the spacing, twenty to forty miles, between\r\nvolcanoes along such a system as Asama-Bandai. The underlying cracks\r\nmust be in echelon arrangement, and the spacing is a function of the\r\nthickness of the upper earth crust and its capacity through the ages of\r\nproducing spaced-out widenings or bends in the crack, above whatever\r\nshell confines the lava. The same spacing of the new and old volcanoes\r\nis true in the Caribbees and in the Costa Rica-Mexico line. There\r\nan old peak might make a Bandaisan by unforeseen breakage and steam\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis applies also to the Ryukyu-Sakurajima line. I visited Kaimon at\r\nthe extreme south end of Kyushu, a steep dome blocked on top by a\r\nlava plug. South of here to Suwanose Island, an active volcano, the\r\nspacing of islands is similar to the northward spacing of Sakurajima,\r\nKirishima, and Asosan, following the same law of selected vents\r\nand offset cracks. Kirishima thirty miles north of Sakurajima is a\r\ntreacherous and dangerous volcano that made a bad explosion just prior\r\nto the Sakurajima eruption. I saw on the rim of its summit cavity a\r\nbreadcrust bomb, a triangular block of rock eight feet long, with its\r\nsurface beautifully tessellated with gaping cracks. This breadcrust\r\nfracture indicates that the fragment of glowing andesite was thrown\r\nup while pasty, then congealed on its surface to smooth glass and\r\ncontinued to swell evenly with internal gas, so as to rupture the\r\nglassy surface as expanding dough.\r\n\r\nAt Aso Volcano farther north I entered a natural gateway into a\r\ncauldron nine miles across, surrounded by a wall, and with a hilly\r\ncountry inside, from which a river escaped through the gateway. The\r\nsummit peak in this landscape proved to contain an active pit on top.\r\nThe pit was steaming and the source of the steam was boiling puddles\r\nof mud at the bottom. This was the “Halemaumau” of Asosan, which has\r\nhad a record of many eruptions near the city of Kumamoto. The chain\r\nof Kyushu volcanoes ends, after the usual spacing, with a volcano at\r\nNagasaki.\r\n\r\nFrom Shimonoseki Strait, going northeastward, new belts of volcanic\r\nfissures have built the mountains of central Japan, cut across\r\nnorthwest of Tokyo by what Naumann called the fossa magna or big\r\ntrench. This is famous in the history of Japanese geology, for which\r\nthis German geologist laid the foundations. The fossa magna extends\r\nnorthwest and southeast, through Fujiyama and Oshima Volcanoes to the\r\nOgasawara Islands and the Bonin Islands, scene of volcanoes making and\r\ndisappearing, from craters under the ocean.\r\n\r\nOmori had discovered historical similarities between the eruptions of\r\nthis chain and those of the Ryukyu chain. This is significant, because\r\nas we go from the small spacing of the individual volcanoes, we come to\r\nsome deeper and larger fracturing of the whole crust of the earth that\r\ndetermines a spacing of hundreds of miles between such larger arcs of\r\nrupture as those of Kyushu and the Bonin Islands. As all are volcanic\r\nand have been so since the birth of the globe, it is unthinkable to me\r\nthat they are anything but deep fractures which go down to the earth’s\r\ncore. The surface geology of marine strata is a mere veneer compared\r\nwith the deep and ancient igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nI went to New Zealand in 1920, taking with me in manuscript form\r\nthe Hawaiian Observatory results of the past decade. Notable among\r\ngeologists there was Dr. Allan Thomson, director of the Dominion Museum\r\nin Wellington. Dr. Thomson and his distinguished father, the Honorable\r\nWilliam Thomson, guided Mrs. Jaggar and me all the way from Auckland to\r\nDunedin. It was my task to give lectures on volcano research, to show\r\nlantern slides of Mount Pelée and Kilauea, to tell about seismographs\r\nand cycles, and to urge upon New Zealand science the importance\r\nof establishing a volcano observatory system in the Taupo Belt of\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nHere, in 1886, had occurred the terrific eruption of Tarawera. Here\r\nare spaced out volcanoes extending north into the islands of Tonga.\r\nHere, possibly, along the Cook Channel between the North and the South\r\nIslands, is a transition from volcanoes to earthquakes, and quite\r\npossibly another fossa magna worthy of comparison with Japan. Off to\r\nthe east lies the profound linear Tonga Deep, compensating the New\r\nZealand volcanic uplift. This is analogous to the Tuscarora Deep east\r\nof Japan.\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate to procure accommodations in Rotorua, the boiling\r\ngeyser district, at the time of the visit of the Prince of Wales, later\r\nKing Edward VIII, and to see the hakas, or dances, of an encampment of\r\n5,000 Maoris, gathered to honor British royalty.\r\n\r\nI was interested in the relics of liquid basalt collected on the lip\r\nof the great rift through Tarawera Mountain. The rupture extends the\r\nlength of Rotomahana Lake, which sank away as a groundwater phenomenon\r\nin 1886. This, like Bandaisan, was one of the great steamblast\r\neruptions of history. It was right on the line of volcano spacing\r\nextending from White Island in the Bay of Plenty, to Ngauruhoe and\r\nRuapehu Volcanoes, beyond Lake Taupo at the south. Here was a land\r\nof echelons of deep cracks, building up along scores of miles from\r\nsubmarine eruptions such as Falcon Island in the Tonga group. Farther\r\nsouth is the dangerous looking White Island close to the New Zealand\r\nshoreline, resembling Bogoslof, and so on to the lava volcanoes at the\r\nsouth. Big earthquakes have been characteristic, along with uplift, of\r\nboth shorelines of Cook Strait.\r\n\r\nThis kind of gradation is certainly like the transitions from\r\nsubmarine eruption to continental uplift, crowned with volcanoes, so\r\ncharacteristic of Japan, the Aleutians, California, and Italy. It is\r\nimpossible to think of it, when we consider water depths of 4,000\r\nfathoms, and a step upward to such altitudes as the New Zealand alps,\r\nall linear for a distance of several hundred miles, except in terms of\r\nthe faulted deep earth crust. And seismologists tell us that that crust\r\nis 1,800 miles deep.\r\n\r\nThe associations made on this trip were destined to have far-reaching\r\neffect in meetings with New Zealand scientists at later dates. I\r\nmet Professor Bartrum of Auckland; the officials of the New Zealand\r\nGeological Survey; Dr. Ernest Marsden, distinguished physicist who\r\nhad worked with Rutherford in England; and Dr. C. A. Cotton, physical\r\ngeographer and author. Cotton showed us the elevated shorelines\r\nof Wellington associated with the big earthquakes of 1851. Other\r\npersonages were Professor Speight, geologist of Christchurch College,\r\nand in Dunedin, Professor R. L. Jack, physicist of Otago University\r\nand our host. Dr. C. E. Adams, government astronomer of Wellington,\r\nwe were to meet again on Tin Can Island in 1930, during the United\r\nStates Eclipse Expedition. Dr. J. MacMillan-Brown, chancellor of\r\nthe University of New Zealand, and his daughter entertained us in\r\nChristchurch; and he later visited us several times in Hawaii in the\r\ncourse of his extensive travels.\r\n\r\nI was glad to stimulate volcanology in New Zealand and pleased when\r\nthere eventually appeared the splendid work of Dr. L. I. Grange, on\r\nthe “Rotorua District,” with a project for geophysical surveys made\r\nimperative by the Napier earthquake disaster.\r\n\r\nBefore this chapter is closed, some personalities of the first decade\r\nof the Observatory should be mentioned. Foremost was L. A. Thurston,\r\nfounder of the Volcano Research Association and its president for many\r\nyears. It was his interest and enthusiasm coupled with that of the\r\nother members of the Association that made the Observatory possible.\r\nProminent among those members was L. W. de Vis-Norton, for many years\r\nsecretary of the Association and a devoted apostle of volcanology.\r\n\r\nMrs. Isabel Jaggar, from 1917, was my helper not only as wife and\r\namanuensis, but as general assistant at the Observatory. She could\r\noperate instruments, take notes at the pit, keep the record books, and\r\nact as buffer against an overinquisitive public.\r\n\r\nThere was Demosthenes Lycurgus, genial Greek host of the Volcano House,\r\nwho did all in his power to help us, by grants of lands, raising money,\r\nand personally promoting science with all the vigor of his wonderful\r\npersonality. He went home to Greece to be married, and alas, died\r\nduring his honeymoon. Later came my good friend George Lycurgus, who\r\nstill operates the Volcano House.\r\n\r\nColleagues of the founding decade included H. O. Wood, who came from\r\nBerkeley in 1912, acted as seismologist and geological assistant, and\r\nestablished a seismological bulletin. He left to enter the army in\r\n1917. In years to come Wood established in Pasadena under the Carnegie\r\nInstitution one of the great seismographic laboratories of the world,\r\nand his name became coupled with a California Institute of Technology\r\nphysicist to name the Wood-Anderson seismograph. Later came R. H. Finch\r\nwho had worked with Dr. Humphreys of the Weather Bureau in Washington\r\nand had been a flight meteorologist in Ireland during the first World\r\nWar. He was assigned by Marvin to me as assistant in 1919, when the\r\nCongress took over our work for the U.S. Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nFinally, I should like to name the numerous workers of the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey in topography and geology, notably Birdseye,\r\nBurkland, Stearns, Wilson, Clark, Meinzer, and Macdonald. These men\r\nbrought to reality my Geological Survey estimate of 1899, when I\r\nrecommended to Walcott a survey of the Hawaiian Islands.\r\n\r\nThe Hawaii geologic survey included investigations of water, highways,\r\nand minerals, and was to map lavas, volcanic processes, and island\r\ngrowth. The annual cost of the work had been estimated at $22,000,\r\nincluding $6,300 for salaries in geology and $10,000 for the total\r\ncost of topography study, or $90,000 for five years. The project was\r\nbegun in 1909 in cooperation with the Territory of Hawaii. In 1951 the\r\nmapping was completed and the cost had been many times the original\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nAmong visitors who contributed to the Observatory work were Sidney\r\nPowers, a voluntary observer who had been one of my students in Boston.\r\nHe explored and published on many volcanoes around the world and\r\nfollowed me in Sakurajima and the Aleutian Islands. He later became an\r\noutstanding petroleum geologist of the Amerada Company in Tulsa. Arthur\r\nHannon, an architect from Cleveland, acted as a volunteer mapper, and\r\nfor months aided with sketches of the changes in Halemaumau. William\r\nTwigg-Smith, an artist from New Zealand, joined us in the lava-sounding\r\nexperiment and made numerous sketches and paintings. He later became\r\nthe illustrator and photographer for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters’\r\nAssociation. Dr. A. L. Day of the Geophysical Laboratory visited us\r\nrepeatedly, in association with gas chemist E. S. Shepherd. He wrote\r\nimportant monographs, along with E. H. Allen the chemist for the\r\nCarnegie Institution, on the Yellowstone and Lassen National Parks, and\r\non Geyserville. Allen came to the Observatory for critical analysis of\r\nthe steam of Sulphur Bank.\r\n\r\nAmong other visitors were geologists, geodesists, and biologists of the\r\nPacific Science Congress, held in the spring of 1920. These included\r\nH. E. Gregory, Griffith Taylor, Frederick Wood-Jones, William Bowie,\r\nT. W. Vaughan, E. O. Hovey, E. C. Andrews, F. Omori, H. S. Washington,\r\nand Dr. Chilton of Christchurch, who had been one of our inspirers in\r\nthe New Zealand trip. This Honolulu world congress assigned one meeting\r\nto Kilauea Volcano, which enabled me to summarize results before a\r\ncosmopolitan group of scientists.\r\n\r\nThe Washington executives who at this time promoted the Observatory\r\nwere Secretary of Agriculture David F. Houston, Director George Otis\r\nSmith of Geological Survey, Chief Charles Marvin of the Weather Bureau,\r\nand Charles D. Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian. Later came W. C.\r\nMendenhall, firm friend of the Observatory, and Director of the Survey.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune that between 1914 and 1919 Mauna Loa and\r\nKilauea were building up lava toward a fiery crisis, and that the\r\nsugar business of Hawaii boomed at the same time. When the 1920\r\nscience congress convened there was much fresh lava to be seen, and\r\nour Research Association was so prosperous that M. I. T. in Boston\r\nkept up its financial interest. The _American Journal of Science_\r\nunder Edward Dana of Yale published our results. This was fitting, as\r\nDana’s father, J. D. Dana, had published much about Hawaiian volcanoes.\r\nConsequently the end of the foundation decade made easier the financing\r\nof the next five years. Just at this time the Geological Survey spurted\r\nahead, the National Park was opened, the Army built a recreation camp\r\nand a trail up Mauna Loa, the Inter-island Steamship Company took over\r\nthe Volcano House, and a Promotion Committee was bringing many tourists.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Fluctuations of Halemaumau lava from 1790 to\r\n  1952, the verticals indicating maximum lowering preceding repose\r\n  periods; minor fluctuations not shown._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                           Expansion Decade\r\n\r\n               “_There shall be famines and earthquakes\r\n                          in divers places._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decade from 1921 through 1930 was a period of tremendous events and\r\nof experimentation at Kilauea and Mauna Loa. It was also an expansion\r\ndecade for the Observatory, and for me. Additional funds made possible\r\nnew buildings and equipment on Hawaii; observatory activity was\r\nestablished at Lassen Volcano in California; and expeditionary work\r\nincluded a study of the 1923 Tokyo earthquakes, explorations on Alaska\r\nvolcanoes in 1927, and a visit to Niuafoou in Tonga, part of the great\r\nNew Zealand-Tonga volcanic chain.\r\n\r\nIncreased government aid was largely due to the help of the Honorable\r\nLouis C. Cramton of Michigan, Republican floor leader of Congress, who\r\ntook great interest in extending activities within national parks.\r\nAfter we moved from Weather Bureau control to Geological Survey in\r\n1924, Cramton visited our Observatory, concluded that it was an orphan\r\nchild of the government, and asked me what I wanted. I told him that\r\nI needed men and machines, and I suggested expanding our studies to\r\nCalifornia and the Aleutians.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Research Association was persuaded that we needed a\r\nfire-resistant iron building to house library accumulation, record\r\nbooks, and photographic negatives, as well as seismograms and lava\r\nspecimens. These were precious relics of the very active overflows\r\nand experiments of the 1912–1921 period. With the advice of Walter F.\r\nDillingham and Engineer John Mason Young of the University of Hawaii, I\r\nbuilt a sheet-iron house with concrete floor and wire-glass skylights,\r\nand installed steel furniture. This became an invaluable office,\r\ndrafting room, and workroom, as well as a place for files.\r\n\r\nThe Volcano Research Association, in cooperation with Hawaii National\r\nPark, built a trail side museum and lecture hall atop the high western\r\nbluff of Kilauea Crater. Later, when the drive was extended completely\r\naround the greater crater, the museum was on the road to Halemaumau.\r\nThis museum had a plate glass front, concrete floor, skylight\r\nillumination, and an esplanade looking down on the caldera and across\r\nthe vast panorama of Mauna Loa, Mauna Kea, and the Kau Desert. The\r\nbuilding protected the lookout platform from the trade winds.\r\n\r\nWe housed in the museum a gleaming, nickel-plated seismograph from\r\nJapan, suitable photographs, and the best of our specimens for visitors\r\nto see. This combined with the magnificent views to instruct the public\r\nin volcanology as nothing else could have done. At the same time, I\r\nequipped machine shops and added a first class mechanic to the staff.\r\n\r\nIt was during this decade and after my New Zealand trip that such\r\npersons as Omori and Nakamura, in Japan, and geologists in Seattle,\r\nBerkeley, and Pasadena began to take an interest in the volcano problem\r\nas dominant in the study of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThere were conflicting theories about the earth crust. Earlier, in\r\nHawaii, Wood was a disciple of the tectonic or contracting theories of\r\nthe earth, whereas I increasingly believed volcanism to be profound,\r\ncrustal, oceanic, and ancient. It is more fundamental than the strata\r\nand mountain folds of continents.\r\n\r\nThis conflict extended to the water question in volcanology. I was\r\ninclined to believe the waters of eruption to be oxidized hydrogen,\r\nwhereas such physical chemists as Day, Shepherd, and Allen believed\r\nwater vapor, like carbon dioxide, to be fundamental in magma.\r\n\r\nThe whole question of the origin of oxygen--the most abundant element\r\nof the rocks, air, and water--is a matter of startling doubt in\r\ngeology. Where oxides are known to exist in lava, flames of oxidation\r\nmake the gaseous fires; and underground water full of oxygen plays a\r\npart in steamblast eruption. All the waters of glaciers and oceans are\r\noxides, and prove that the volcanic oxidation of hydrogen was the most\r\nprimitive of the volcanic processes. Dr. E. H. Allen found water vapor\r\ndominant in the Sulphur Bank gas at Kilauea, whereas Day and Shepherd,\r\nwho opposed Brun, thought water dominant in the gases of live lava.\r\nIts great preponderance in geological theory for such eruptions as\r\nVesuvius led Allen to review theories and publish a long paper designed\r\nto refute my notion that oxidizing hydrogen is the primary volcanic\r\ningredient.\r\n\r\nAs to earthquakes and so-called tectonic faults, the whole of geology\r\nhas its thinking so warped by continents, the dwelling place of\r\nmankind, and so diverted from the great linear trenches and the ridges\r\nof the ocean crowned with volcanoes parallel to the deeps, that I\r\nbecame incredulous, along with Willis and Oldham, about the textbook\r\ncause of earthquakes.\r\n\r\nThe fascination offered by fossils, by ages of shellfish and reptiles,\r\nand by mountains of folded strata like the Alps and the Himalaya makes\r\nthe votaries of evolutionary science neglect the mud-covered rocks and\r\noceanic mountain ranges of almost three-quarters of the surface of the\r\nglobe. This seventy-two percent they have never seen, nor collected\r\nhard rock specimens from, nor even mapped topographically. They are not\r\nacquainted with it by exploration, and their theories about it are a\r\nblank, except that gravity pendulums indicate it to be basalt.\r\n\r\nThe so-called geosyncline, or continental basin of sediments, filled\r\nwith shells and strata as is the Mediterranean, is at the heart of\r\nall the theories of continents and mountains; and geology expressly\r\nexcludes the geosyncline and its strata from the probabilities of deep\r\nocean valleys. The most interesting subjects of continental geology\r\nare simply banished from conjecture. Interest in deep-ocean geology is\r\nlacking because science has made no field effort to bore or blast into\r\nit, and so extend engineering science to the deep ocean bottoms.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes made a theme wherein I instinctively distrusted the word\r\n“tectonic.” For generations the geological mind thought the earth\r\nlosing heat, contracting internally, and wrinkling a crust in bumps,\r\nwith vast overthrusts of broken strata, thus folding the Appalachians\r\nand the Andes. All sorts of accommodations to a thin crust thirty miles\r\ndeep were invented; by Dana and Geikie, by Suess and Wiechert, and\r\nfinally by one who should have been the foremost block faulting expert,\r\nDutton. Hawaii convinced him that volcanoes are only skin deep and that\r\nthe thin crust is so sensitive that a shift of the weight of river\r\nmuds and sands is enough to push down the great valley of California,\r\nwhile an underflow pushes up the Sierra Nevada. This is the doctrine\r\nof “isostasy.” It agrees with the Stübel idea of shallow remnant\r\nreservoirs for the lava of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIsostasy was devised by Dutton and pounced upon by the mathematicians,\r\nuntil they had gravity proving the whole world thin-crusted over an\r\nunderstratum of plastic lava. The seismologists on continents agreed,\r\nfinding a density change, but with no evidence of fluidity. The world\r\nbecame, mathematically and petrologically, a sphere built of layers\r\nall the way down to the heavy fluid hot core, which was conveniently\r\nimagined to consist of iron and nickel, because some bolides of the\r\nsolar system made of those metals occasionally fall on the earth.\r\n\r\nAll my experience of volcanoes and of deep oceans militated against a\r\nthin crust, a shallow underlayer of basalt to feed volcanoes, and a\r\nnickel iron core. The core is heavy, and sixty-two elements are heavier\r\nthan iron. All reason seemed against the notion that the vast volcanic\r\nsea bottoms are a thin crust wrinkling under contraction. Reason found\r\nevery evidence on both earth and moon for a thick peridotite or olivine\r\ncrust, broken into ancient blocks, bounded by long lines of fracture,\r\nthe blocks variously settling and scraping against each other from\r\ntime immemorial, actuated by volcanic forces from the core. The whole\r\nof volcanology points toward sinking and down-faulted ocean basins,\r\nalongside the remnant upstanding continents which are the minor feature\r\nof the primitive earth surface. Water condensed and filled hollows.\r\nThe processes of the core that made all this were volcanism--mother of\r\nair, ocean, seabottom, land, and life. The crust was thick enough to\r\nmake cracks 2,000 miles long on a globe 8,000 miles in diameter. If\r\nthere was a balancing of weights as in “isostasy,” it was between high\r\nsilica in continental lava and low silica basalt that spread under the\r\noceans. This is not static, but is a continuing process of a kinetic,\r\nor changing, earth.\r\n\r\nThis excursion into theory is intentional, so that in the middle\r\nof this book the geologically trained reader will understand that\r\nexperience of volcanoes in Hawaii, the Caribbean, New Zealand, Alaska,\r\nItaly, and Japan had made me a rebel against conventional geology. The\r\nreason is that the great submerged mountain range of the long Hawaiian\r\nArchipelago is different from the mountain ranges of Europe and Asia\r\nand must be accounted for in global history. How would the three\r\ndecades 1921 to 1950 confirm expectation that the deep ocean bottom is\r\nthe most important and volcanic thing in geology, just as it is the\r\nbiggest thing?\r\n\r\nRoutine observation and photography at Halemaumau pit reached a climax\r\nof recording brilliant fiery events in March 1921, and it changed\r\nto the recording of explosive steam in May 1924. The first of these\r\nfireworks, after lava flows from a rift in the Kau Desert, draining the\r\npit and fluctuating with the ups and downs of the pit lava, occurred in\r\n1919–1920. This was a return to Halemaumau of effervescence in frothy\r\nvolumes, so that the pit was overflowing on five sides. On March 20,\r\n1921, occurred the most intense display of brilliancy, culminating the\r\ngradual rising of the lava column to outflow following 1918.\r\n\r\nThen came, in the later months of 1921, a sinking away and recovery of\r\nthe lava. In 1922 came a sinking again, with the lava breaking out in\r\nthe Chain of Craters of the eastern rift, as though it had been blocked\r\nby freezing in the southwest rift and was forced over to split open the\r\nold cracks of the mountain to the east. This was confirmed in 1923 by\r\nanother outbreak in the forest adjacent to the sixth crater, Makaopuhi,\r\nwhich with Napau pit beyond, had been the scene of the 1922 outflows.\r\n\r\nThis action was all extended in April 1924 to the shoreline end of\r\nthe eastern rift, thirty miles away from Halemaumau, when the Kapoho\r\ncountry cracked open with many earthquakes, and a block of the mountain\r\nsettled beneath sea level. Coconut palms at the beach were left in a\r\nlagoon of sea water eight feet deep. Seventy-five earthquakes in a\r\nday frightened away Filipino plantation laborers; railway and roads\r\nwere ruptured, with new cliffs forming nine feet high; and all of this\r\nfollowed a monumental sinking of Halemaumau bottom, from a vast sea of\r\nlava to a tumble of debris in two months.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that between 1920 and 1924 the fracture of the long\r\ncurved rift athwart Kilauea cauldron from the Kau Desert to the east\r\npoint of the island was draining the lava out under the ocean to the\r\neast. Forty miles from the shore, the submarine slope is covered by\r\n18,000 feet of water.\r\n\r\nWhat is the result? The whole of Kilauea Mountain is charged with\r\ngroundwater, which trickles warm through the beach at Pohoiki and\r\npartly warms ponds near Kapoho. Obviously this groundwater of the\r\nsoutheastern lobe of the island mountain surrounds the shaft of\r\nHalemaumau at some undefined depth, and the rising and falling glassy\r\nlava in the shaft ordinarily glazes itself with a water-tight skin, and\r\nmay be thought of as a crusted tube. About this tube the groundwater\r\nshows only as the lazy steam of the little vents of the pit margins.\r\nOn May 10, 1924, came the collapse of the Halemaumau pit walls,\r\nintroducing an explosive steam eruption such as had not been seen by\r\nfive generations of Hawaiians.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of this period were glorious ones for the scientists.\r\nFirst should be mentioned the amazing subsidence which occurred\r\nsuddenly at 2 A.M. November 28, 1919, just as Mrs. Jaggar\r\nlooked across Kilauea Crater at the outline of crags and lava lakes\r\nmaking a glowing dome where Halemaumau pit should have been. We felt\r\na lot of little earthquakes and saw the dome of lava heapings, with\r\nglowing lakes on top, sink slowly and majestically and leave the old\r\nfamiliar glowing pit. For almost the whole of 1919 this had been a\r\ndome, with overflows, now here, now there. At ten o’clock only the\r\nevening before, old Alec had conducted tourists to the top of the dome,\r\nwhere they looked down at the clover-leaf lakes. If it had started to\r\ngo down while they were there--and any of us might have been there--it\r\nis awesome to think of the inevitable fiery engulfment.\r\n\r\nAfter watching the sinking, which was followed by puffs of dust and\r\nsmoke and some avalanche noise, we took a car to the pit at once. And\r\nwhen we got there in the early morning hours we found the pit enlarged\r\nto 2,000 feet across, with the pattern of the lava lakes still apparent\r\nat the bottom, indicating that the entire cylinder had lowered as a\r\nunit to a depth of about 700 feet. Red hot avalanches were tumbling\r\ninward with a roar, from the veneer of lava plastered on the wall.\r\nBy the forenoon of that day the liquid lava started to pour up and\r\ninward as a ring of bubbling fountains all around the edges. What this\r\nring represented was the wall crack between the subsided cylinder\r\nof semisolid lava, now pushing upward, and the funnel of rock wall\r\noutside. This V-shaped filling grew wider as the uprising progressed,\r\nand so the ring lake became wider, while the top of the harder column\r\nbecame a ring of crags and the space inside became a quiet lava puddle\r\nsupplied by inflow from the ring lake. The whole column of ring crags\r\nwith the lagoon inside and the brilliantly fountaining lake outside\r\nrose with unheard of rapidity during the next three weeks.\r\n\r\nIn mid-December, I took Mrs. Jaggar and a woman friend down to inspect\r\nthis amazing corolla, or lily, of hard crags which had blossomed up in\r\nless than a month, so that the outer ring of boiling fluid was less\r\nthan a hundred feet below us. We stood at the rift in the Kilauea floor\r\nwhich heads toward the southwest cliff, and suddenly we felt slight\r\nearthquakes and saw the face of that cliff crumbling in a visible\r\ntumble of rocks. The mountain was quietly breaking open athwart the\r\nKilauea caldera floor, and while we watched we saw forty or fifty low\r\nlava fountains in a straight line burst up along a floor crack between\r\nus and the cliff.\r\n\r\nRemember that this crack traversed the downslope between Halemaumau\r\nedge and Kilauea wall. Looking back at the ring lake, we saw it\r\nbeginning to lower and leave a shoreline of black plastering spatter.\r\nWhen we looked into the rift crack at our feet, only one or two feet\r\ngaping open, the liquid lava showed about twenty feet down. We were\r\nstanding on the side of the crack away from the motor car terminus, and\r\nfloods of lava on the Kilauea floor were spreading right and left from\r\nthe straight line of vents between us and Kilauea wall. We had to get\r\naway from there pronto, as no one could tell what ground might erupt\r\nbetween us and our car.\r\n\r\nI carefully instructed our friend to be deliberate and step across the\r\nfissure; but the girl felt sure that crossing a red hot crack called\r\nfor a leap. She stepped on a loose slab at the edge of the narrow chasm\r\nand slipped into the crack, where she was wedged until we pulled her\r\nout. We then stepped across the fissure, for the live lava was far\r\nbelow, and made our way back to the car without further trouble.\r\n\r\nThe lake lowered only apportionately to the slowing black outflow on\r\nthe south floor, which was short-lived. This was the beginning of a\r\nsplitting open of the main Kilauea Mountain flank southwest and outside\r\nthe crater which continued for months.\r\n\r\nAnother adventure, and an important one, happened with the outflooding\r\nof lava in the Kau Desert, where terrace upon terrace of pahoehoe lava\r\nwas building up. This finally became a hill over the rift, two miles\r\nlong and 200 feet high, which we called Mauna Iki, or little Mauna Loa.\r\nThe exploration, day after day, of the extending quiet lava outwelling\r\nalong this rift made it necessary to find new trails from the Pahala\r\nroadway and across the desert to the lengthening hillock.\r\n\r\nFollowing the new Mauna Iki trail, Mr. Finch noticed that the ancient\r\nash beds, two or three feet thick, had surfaces as hard as Portland\r\ncement. And on one of these he, like Robinson Crusoe, found the print\r\nof a naked foot, made when the old ash was a mud. On the trail across\r\nthese old surfaces many more hardened, ancient footprints were found,\r\nof men, women, children, and pigs headed both up and down the mountain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _18. Isabel and Tom Jaggar in woods on Kilauea\r\n  Volcano on their return from viewing 1923 eruption in Napau\r\n  Crater_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _19. Lava lake, fountains, and crags, March 20,\r\n  1921_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _20. Footprints in ash west of Mauna Iki, said\r\n  to have been made by Keoua’s army during Halemaumau eruption of\r\n  1790_]\r\n\r\nThese prints recalled the story of Keoua’s army when there was a big\r\nexplosive eruption of Halemaumau in 1790 and the mud rains of the\r\nperiod were from ash which had been baked by the volcanic fires. If\r\nroasted and moistened, the chemical composition of powdered basalt\r\nis that of weak cement, and these surfaces were in hollows which had\r\nresisted erosion wash for 130 years. Part of the slopes closer to\r\nHalemaumau had been eroded bare, but they also showed footprints.\r\nLater the trail was followed up the mountain close to Kilauea Crater\r\nand down toward Pahala, and the ash of 1790 was found to be made up of\r\npisolites, or fossil raindrops, in many places. Evidently the eruption\r\nhad been accompanied by torrential thunder storms, and the natives had\r\nwalked through the deposits of mud, which had in a century been dried\r\nby the sun into a resistant surface. These fossil footprints were to\r\nbecome one of the attractions of a tourist trail in the National Park.\r\n\r\nOne night in 1922, after some earthquakes of the evening, we were\r\nawakened by friends who told us that a glow like a forest fire could\r\nbe seen from the high cliffs of Kilauea in the easterly direction of\r\nMakaopuhi. This big crater had a platform at one end and a pit at the\r\nother. We aroused Mr. Finch, then traveled by car as far as we could go\r\non the truck trail, got lost, and with flashlights made our way on foot\r\ntoward the glow and fume in a rugged wilderness, over cracked ground\r\nand old aa lava and obstructing vegetation. We were chilled by a cold\r\ndrizzle and not at all sure where we would emerge.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the country is sufficiently open so that we could see the\r\n“pillar of fire by night.” It turned out that the new fire was in the\r\ndeep end of Makaopuhi itself. From the western edge of Makaopuhi pit\r\nwe looked down on ten or fifteen ribbons of lava, made by a line of\r\nspouting fountains at the top of the talus heap, and pouring from the\r\ntop of the big slide-rock slope. We spent the night on the edge in much\r\ndiscomfort, and watched the puddle of accumulation in the bottom of the\r\nfunnel and the glowing streaks which fed it. It was evident that the\r\neastern rift of Kilauea Mountain had opened, and the lava outflow was\r\nfound to extend to Napau Crater, a shallow saucer pit farther east.\r\nAt the same time the lava in Halemaumau went down, enlarging the pit,\r\nand cauliflower dust clouds arose from much internal avalanching. This\r\nanticipated and resembled the avalanche steam blasts of 1924.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of the 1924 explosive eruption were too numerous and\r\ncomplicated to elaborate here. However, it was a tremendous event in\r\nthe history of Hawaii and was totally unforeseeable on the basis of\r\nearlier experience. Mrs. Jaggar and I were in New York writing magazine\r\narticles and I was giving lectures, when word came from Finch and the\r\nnewspapers that Halemaumau was caving in and throwing up rocks. We\r\ntraveled with all haste to Honolulu, where the Navy agreed to send me\r\nby plane to Hilo, though they refused to take Mrs. Jaggar.\r\n\r\nThe Admiral’s car took us to Pearl Harbor, where a seaplane was ready\r\nand Mr. Thurston was waiting to see me off, accompanied by a motion\r\npicture cameraman. Then pilot Chourré took me into the sky over Diamond\r\nHead on my first flight. A companion plane was piloted by Lieutenant\r\nSinton, who had radio communication with Pearl Harbor. Crossing high\r\nabove the Molokai Channel, I looked down at the beautiful pattern\r\nof trade-wind formed whitecaps, and was surprised after a half hour\r\nto observe that the wave crests were farther apart. I was even more\r\nsurprised to see Sinton’s plane far above us. The mechanic in the\r\nforward cockpit had been putting up his fingers repeatedly during our\r\nflight, to indicate, I later learned, how many cylinders were missing\r\nin the Liberty engine supported above us. Our plane was getting closer\r\nand closer to the waves and flying fish raced beside us. Finally we\r\nfelt the bump of wave after wave on the bottoms of the pontoons, and\r\nthe pilot brought the seaplane to a squelching stop, close to the surf\r\nof the Molokai reef.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves in fifteen feet of water, the coral reef visible\r\nbelow. I was deputed to throw out an anchor and make the line fast to\r\na cleat, while pilot and mechanic climbed up to the engine, which had\r\nbeen losing compression and could not keep up the requisite speed.\r\nLieutenant Sinton’s pilot plane came down and circled above us until he\r\nsaw we were safe, then went on to Maui. Meanwhile, I watched the water\r\nwith great interest, for sharks. When our boys got the engine going\r\nwith a roar, I pulled up the anchor and we took off against wind and\r\nwave, with the pontoons going bang, bang, bang, against the tops of the\r\nwaves. But finally we were airborne and out above the blue water.\r\n\r\nThen the engine gave out again and we came down. This time the men\r\nrigged a sea anchor made of buckets with a line attached to the bow,\r\nto hold the ship’s nose up to the wind, and battened the hatches with\r\ncanvas covers. We clambered up on top of the upper wing to wait for\r\nrescue. The wind was blowing a gale, the whitecaps hissed by us, and we\r\nlay on our bellies. The aviators told me that this was the first forced\r\nlanding they had had. The word landing seemed to me inapplicable.\r\n\r\nWe drifted for five hours, moving slowly down the wind, before a white\r\nmotor boat appeared, coming from Molokai. At the same time smoke showed\r\nfrom two rescue vessels in the Pearl Harbor and Maui directions\r\nrespectively. Sinton, who had radioed for help, flew back and circled\r\nabove us, reminding me of the goonies soaring over a wounded bird on a\r\nfish line which I had seen in Alaskan waters. The Molokai boat reached\r\nus first, picked up our sea anchor and towed us into Kaunakakai. We\r\npitched so and took such a pounding from the gigantic trade-wind waves\r\nthat it didn’t seem possible that the mahogany hull and the two lateral\r\npontoons could hold together. However, we made the harbor and tied up\r\nto the buoy.\r\n\r\nI hoped and prayed that the commercial packet, the _Mauna Kea_,\r\nmight take me to Hilo. But no, the navy tug _Navaho_ came from\r\nLahaina, and Captain Green put up his megaphone and announced that the\r\nAdmiral’s instructions were that he was to take Dr. Jaggar to Hawaii.\r\nMy heart sank because I knew what a seaway would be running against\r\nthat little tub. The second rescue ship proved to be the _Pelican_\r\nequipped with a crane to swing the plane on board and take it back to\r\nPearl Harbor.\r\n\r\nOn board the _Navaho_ I was assigned a canvas camp cot in the\r\nlower, circular wheelhouse at the bow; and all night long waves broke\r\nover the bow and a foot of water sloshed back and forth under my cot.\r\nThe pitching was so heavy and our speed so reduced that it took us all\r\nnight to get across the Hawaii Channel, and we didn’t make Hilo until 2\r\nP.M. the second day. After that wet and seasick night, I found\r\nwry humor in our reception at Hilo Wharf, where we were met by Frank\r\nCody with his motion picture camera and a bunch of hula girls and leis.\r\nInstead of five hours, the journey took thirty and quite failed to make\r\nme air-minded. Furthermore, I arrived at Kilauea Volcano in time for\r\nonly the final stages of the explosive eruption.\r\n\r\nFinch had organized volunteers, including Oliver Emerson as\r\nphotographer, and even our collie dog, Teddy, who could hear and feel\r\nan explosion coming before we had any other warning. All observers\r\nwrote notes and fondled the seismographs during the three weeks of\r\nsteam blast and cavings in of the pit, which had enlarged itself by\r\ncollapse 700 feet outward radially in all directions. When I got there\r\nit was 3,500 by 3,000 feet in diameters and 1,300 feet deep, the bottom\r\na funnel of converging taluses, made of avalanches from the pit walls.\r\nThe taluses were wet and steaming vigorously in vertical lines, and\r\nat night showed red hot avalanches from the north and west walls,\r\nwhere two intrusive bodies of hard rock were red hot inside. The talus\r\nbelow stayed hot, and slides occurred for only a few seconds. The\r\nincandescent matter was not flowing in any sense, but was, rather, the\r\npeeling of a rocky boss of reddish color at the west and a canoe-shaped\r\nledge at the north about 600 feet below the rim.\r\n\r\nThis showed the cross section of old screes, revealed above it, and\r\nhorizontal basalt flows overlapping above that. It was a beautiful\r\nsection of an ancient pit, of the same quality as Halemaumau itself,\r\nand the incandescent canoe sill at the bottom appeared to be an\r\nintrusion of fine-grained gabbro, which had pushed its way in under an\r\nolder talus funnel, similar to the present talus cup of Halemaumau, the\r\nbottom of which was 700 feet lower.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite wall of the pit the Kau Desert rift was displayed as\r\na vertical cavern or arcade, merging into a group of dikes higher\r\nup and tapering to zero thinness at the top. These same dikes, less\r\nconspicuous, cut the canoe sill on the northeast wall, to indicate\r\nthat the ring of the pit was fractured vertically from below. This\r\nfracture is the main deep rift of the mountain which crosses under\r\nKilauea, bending in the direction of Kilauea Iki, and this it was which\r\nhad opened as a curved chasm to let the lava down. Lava had gone down\r\nin a succession of flank outflows, with intervening rises, from the\r\nKau Desert in 1920 to the final drainage under the sea at the east.\r\nThis drainage had let in the groundwater, made a steam boiler, and so\r\ncaused the explosive eruption and engulfment of Halemaumau walls as the\r\nmountain yawned open.\r\n\r\nA. L. Day made one of his return excursions to Kilauea at this time\r\nand thus saw the extraordinary phenomenon of the hard basaltic\r\nintrusive bodies half way down the walls, caving to a red hot talus.\r\nThe explosions, which started with two-hour intervals, gradually\r\ndecreased, coming at four hours and eight hours; and on May 18 came the\r\nculminating cauliflower clouds with torrents downward of broken rock,\r\nsome of it showing low red heat. At all times the motive power was\r\nsteam jets 10 to 15 thousand feet high, which plastered the pahoehoe of\r\nthe pit edge with broken wall rock fragments of every size.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of pasty lava or glassy bombs in the ejecta, and\r\nthe red incandescence seen at night in some of the explosions was the\r\navalanche material of the western boss and the canoe sill.\r\n\r\nIt took the pit less than two months, to mid-July, to recover its\r\nliquid lava, which poured through the talus and made aa puddles,\r\nto form a new pattern of cone source and short-lived flows. Then\r\neverything came to rest, and lava activity was not resumed there until\r\nthe summer of 1927. However, in 1926 Mauna Loa went into action on its\r\nsouthwestern rift, and sent an aa flow into the sea at South Kona,\r\ndestroying the village of Hoopuloa.\r\n\r\nHere was history in the island lava column of majestic decline and\r\nrecovery from 1914 onward. Outflow in Mauna Loa crater at 13,000 feet\r\nin 1914 extended to outflow from the southwest rift in 1916 and 1919 at\r\n8,000 feet. Next, in 1920, came outflow in the Kau Desert from Kilauea,\r\nat 3,000 feet. There were alternating spurts upward within Halemaumau\r\npit, acting as a crater similar to Mauna Loa’s at the lower Kilauea\r\nlevel of 3,700 feet.\r\n\r\nThen this whole progress downward moved over to the Chain of Craters at\r\n2,500 feet, and finally to the ruptured earthquake rift of Kapoho on\r\nthe east point of Hawaii and at beach level. Some miles farther east,\r\non the same rift beneath the sea, the gigantic submarine mountain of\r\nHawaii drained the last lava from Halemaumau pit and let in groundwater\r\nwhich caused steam explosions.\r\n\r\nJuly 1924 saw the deep lava recovering in the crack and sealing off the\r\nwater, so as to bubble up in the bottom debris of Halemaumau and push\r\nits way upward into the crevices of the island. It reached the top of\r\nMauna Loa in 1926 and reactuated outflow at the center of the island.\r\nThis migration of vents from top to bottom and back again took twelve\r\nyears of fracturing, and it relieved from lava this big piece of the\r\nHawaiian ridge. In reaching the groundwater and steamblast phase, it\r\naccomplished something which had not happened since 1790, making a\r\nsupercycle of 134 years.\r\n\r\nThe decade after explosion at Halemaumau was marked by small lava\r\ngushes in the bottom of the pit, bringing the depth from 1,300 feet in\r\n1924 to 750 feet in 1934. The layers were something less than 100 feet\r\neach, and they were fed by pahoehoe conelets at the slide-rock margin.\r\nAs usual, the lava was gushing up the western wall crack along the\r\nmargin of the bottom magma cylinder. There was no trace of recurrence\r\nof steam blasts.\r\n\r\nDespite the excitement of actual events, experimentation continued; and\r\nI continued working on inventions for the experiments. Two approaches\r\nto our problems concerned seismic recorders which could be put in the\r\nhands of amateurs, and range finders for improving pit surveys. I had\r\nbeen convinced for many years that the three-component seismograph was\r\ntoo elaborate to be operated by volunteer school teachers or telephone\r\noperators who have other things to do. Such a seismograph records with\r\nphotographic paper the north-south, east-west, and up-down motion of\r\nthe ground, on a chronograph which keeps accurate time and registers a\r\nwavy line every second, so that the recording paper has to be changed\r\nand developed every day. Moreover, these instruments are for measuring\r\ndistance to earthquake origins by physics of wave motion, and they have\r\nbecome hopelessly mathematical. Such mathematics makes for assumptions\r\nof uniformity about a rock crust which is not uniform. Qualitative\r\nscience wants to know what happens at a specific rock location and\r\nwants the motion recorded by the simplest possible mechanical device.\r\nIt also wants a value in number at each location, for size and\r\ndirection of the first motion. This is for an earthquake, identified\r\nas one incident, over such an island as Hawaii, where the rock units\r\nare many and different. This is especially true of long periods of time\r\nwhen there may be no earthquakes to record.\r\n\r\nI devised a simple shock recorder, consisting of a horizontal boom of\r\nvery light wood attached to a hinged weight which swung like a door,\r\nso that the boom scratched a line on a circular card which was rotated\r\nand moved along by a common alarm clock. The result was a spiral mark\r\non the card, such that an earthquake interposed would write a zigzag\r\nopposite a place on the clock face appropriate to the time of day. All\r\nthat was necessary was to remove and date the card, wind the clock once\r\na day, and measure the zigzag.\r\n\r\nMr. Ingalls of _Scientific American_ read an article by me in\r\nwhich I described my shock recorder and thought it would lead amateur\r\nmachinists to devise their own machines and to record the vibrations\r\nabout them. Numerous amateurs did send in designs for instruments, and\r\nIngalls believed that the seismograph hobby would become as popular as\r\nthe amateur astronomical telescope hobby. But it failed because the\r\namateurs were waiting for earthquakes, which didn’t happen. They were\r\nnot content with vibrations from trucks, railroad trains, waterfalls,\r\nsurf on rocks, artillery practice, or wind storms.\r\n\r\nMy improved shock recorder gained some use later in New Zealand\r\nand Montserrat, after big earthquakes in those places stirred the\r\nauthorities to build simple instruments. However, popular seismoscope\r\nsimply doesn’t exist.\r\n\r\nThe range finder I had been working on since my teaching days in\r\nMassachusetts Tech, where I had made an optical device with a traveling\r\nindex mirror which moved along an upright scale of centimeters, and\r\na sextant telescope. The idea was a transit, with self-contained base\r\nline close to the operator. My theory was that in such measurements of\r\ndistance as we had to use--to about a thousand feet or less, to the\r\nlava fountains in the bottom of Halemaumau pit--we might read off the\r\nvertical distance from a single station, when all other stations were\r\nenclosed in smoke.\r\n\r\nIn the Aleutian Islands and elsewhere I experimented with a Zeiss\r\nstereoscopic rangefinder designed for artillery ranges, but it was\r\nnot accurate enough for short distances. Everything in my instrument\r\ndepended on moving a telescope parallel to itself with superlative\r\nprecision, on a scale within the instrument. I finally hit upon using\r\na track of taut piano wire, probably the straightest line in all\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nIf one first looked at an object twenty miles away (infinite distance),\r\nthe telescope could be moved along right and left and the image would\r\nremain immovable on a vertical hair. If it were now focussed on an\r\nobject 1,000 feet away, the displacement of the telescope on the\r\ncentimeter scale would measure the distance with a high degree of\r\naccuracy. This was the stadia principle inverted to contain the rod at\r\nthe observing position.\r\n\r\nI also made several graphic devices for surveying Halemaumau daily from\r\nthe rim benchmarks. However, when lava overtopped the rim and destroyed\r\nthe datum posts, mapping became difficult.\r\n\r\nDrilling temperature wells into the floor and rim of Kilauea Crater\r\nwas a project I had anticipated when Mr. John Brooks Henderson of\r\nWashington came to Hawaii and offered to help finance it. We had taken\r\nthe temperature of hot cracks in many places, and found them to range\r\nfrom 320° Centigrade at the Postal Card Crack close to Halemaumau, down\r\nto 96° Centigrade at Sulphur Bank, and then on to lower temperatures at\r\nmany cracks which yielded visible vapor in damp weather but no vapor at\r\nall in sunshine. A spectacle for tourists was a crack on the Sulphur\r\nBank flat, where a cigar to windward or the exhaust gas of a car would\r\nnucleate the invisible vapor and cause a big puff of white “steam” to\r\nshow. This phenomenon, which depends on smoke particles condensing\r\ninvisible water vapor, is well known at Solfatara near Naples.\r\n\r\nThe experimental approach to finding out what the temperature of the\r\nground really is, is to drill a hole and keep the temperature measured\r\nrepeatedly with a thermometer, and to find out the thermal gradient\r\nchange vertically if possible. This means to measure how much the\r\ntemperature changes with depth. The whole problem concerns how much\r\nunusual heat energy is released at a place like Kilauea Crater.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of Hobart, a drilling engineer, I started at Sulphur Bank\r\nwith a churn drill. We quickly discovered that we were going through\r\nintensely hard basalt, containing metallic sulfide which appeared to\r\nbe pyrite but turned out to be marcasite. After drilling for several\r\nyears--with four holes at Sulphur Bank, one sixty-foot hole under\r\nthe observatory shop, and about twenty-five holes in the eastern\r\npart of the Kilauea floor over a surveyed map pattern--we changed to\r\na rotary core drill using steel shot, and then changed again to a\r\npercussion drill actuated by compressed air, for shallow holes to show\r\ncross-country temperatures. Unfortunately core drilling requires large\r\nquantities of water, which we did not have, for the Hawaii National\r\nPark depends upon rainwater collected from roofs in redwood tanks.\r\nWithout water cooling, rotary bits heat and expand in hot rock, stick,\r\nand are often lost.\r\n\r\nTwo seventy-foot holes, one at Sulphur Bank and the other in the middle\r\nof Kilauea floor, showed no definite thermal gradient; and in general\r\nit turned out that drill holes were dependent on steam in the cracks\r\nfor their temperatures.\r\n\r\nHeat was brought up by vapor, and in a number of ten-foot holes\r\nscattered over the Kilauea floor, the hottest were at the edge of the\r\nfloor. The Postal Card Crack, near the edge of Halemaumau and 600\r\nfeet above red hot intrusives, was exceptionally hot, and it is not\r\nat all clear how the water made contact with the hot intrusive rock\r\nunderneath. This place completely caved in and was lost forever within\r\nthe enlarged pit of 1924. Sulphur Bank itself is at the edge of an old\r\nKilauea floor on a shelf at a high level. The extra heat at floor edges\r\nmeans a wall crack between the crater fill and the confining funnel, so\r\nthat hot gas comes up from intrusive lava somewhere deep down toward\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nThus when a mercurial thermometer was lowered, ten-foot holes would\r\nshow a hot place half way down and cold rock at the bottom. Some holes\r\nhad no heat at all, which meant that an inclined steam crack was cut\r\nacross by the hole or that no steam crack was present. The heat supply\r\nwas dependent upon vapor channels from heated rainwater, but we were\r\nnever able, owing to lack of funds, to drill a hole deep enough to find\r\nthe water supply which made the steam. It is a remarkable fact that the\r\ncasings on three wells at Sulphur Bank emit continuously a column of\r\nsteam exactly at the theoretical boiling point for this altitude, as\r\nthough the groundwater were boiling only a short distance below. Dr.\r\nAllen by his analyses proved that Sulphur Bank vapor was ninety-nine\r\npercent steam and that the remainder contained fractions of a percent\r\nof sulfur and carbon dioxide, but this sulfur was enough in the course\r\nof months to coat the interior of our casings with yellow crystals over\r\nblack iron sulfide. It coated the Sulphur Bank with yellow crystals of\r\nsulfur and soaked the rock below to generate brassy iron sulfide.\r\n\r\nThe result of these experiments was to exhibit the complexity of any\r\nsolfatara in its relation to underground lava, and to the soakage\r\nof a volcanic country by rainfall. This is especially important for\r\nMartinique and Montserrat.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment was conducted by Emerson, who was equipped by the\r\nObservatory with chemical apparatus to make qualitative analyses of\r\nnumerous Kilauea products, and he also did critical photographic\r\nwork, including some photography in the infra-red. In one valuable\r\nexperiment, he melted Kilauea lava in a refractory crucible at a\r\ntemperature of about 1200° Centigrade until it was as fluid as honey.\r\nAllowed to chill and harden naturally, it was shiny glass like pahoehoe\r\nlava. If stirred with an iron rod, it made sprouted black needles,\r\ncrystallized all through, like aa lava. Thus he proved that stirring\r\nmade Hawaiian lava crystallize and sprout like fudge, or like the\r\nsolidification of such metals as silver and bismuth. Sudden outbreak\r\nand stirring anywhere will convert pahoehoe to aa; but never does aa\r\nbecome converted physically to pahoehoe, unless flame melts it. The\r\nstanding pinnacles in the midst of an aa flow, which breaks up into\r\nboulders, give evidence of the stirring process.\r\n\r\nWhen Emerson’s discovery is applied to basaltic lava flows, it appears\r\nthat the glassy lava of a source, when stirred by gas fountaining or\r\nby flowing, will change from its glassy condition to a sprouting and\r\ncrystallizing condition. All flows are glassy pahoehoe pumice fountains\r\nat source vents, and a quarter of a mile away they become aa. Later the\r\nsource pahoehoe preserves itself within a glassy skin and pours forward\r\nunder glassy shells and frontal toes.\r\n\r\nR. M. Wilson’s work supplied proof of a swelling mountain. Wilson\r\nwas one of the three leading members of the topographic party of the\r\nGeological Survey. The other two were C. Birdseye and A. Burkland.\r\nWilson, whom I had known as a student in M. I. T., was a product of\r\nSpofford’s Civil Engineering department and was to become the chief\r\ncomputer of the Survey in Washington. As levelman in Birdseye’s\r\norganization, he became topographic engineer of the Observatory, and\r\nproduced by precise leveling and triangulation the brilliant experiment\r\nwhich showed [the swelling and shrinking of the mountain during fifteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBy close cooperation with the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey we\r\nplaced a tide gauge at Hilo, both for a sea level base and to record\r\ntidal waves. Wilson also, in 1921, ran a level line from Hilo to the\r\nVolcano House benchmark, where the Geological Survey had run levels\r\nin 1911. The county roadway was marked with bronze plates inscribed\r\nwith leveling heights, and Wilson’s results showed the edge of Kilauea\r\nCrater to be three feet higher in 1921 than it had been in 1911.\r\n\r\nWilson’s determination of heights above sea level certified that the\r\nwhole mountain swelled up during the ten years prior to 1921. About\r\n1918, lava and seismographs had proved rising overflow at the center,\r\nwhile the edge of Kilauea Crater was being tilted away from the\r\ncenter. This went on during the massive rising of the interior lava\r\nof Halemaumau into a dome where the pit had been, and it proved that\r\nKilauea Mountain was being injected along cracks, not only under the\r\npit, but along the rifts, as indicated by outflow on the southwest and\r\neast in the years 1920 and 1924.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all of Wilson’s work. He revisited all surveying\r\nstations after the big collapse of Halemaumau that accompanied the\r\nexplosive eruption of May 1924, and found that the Volcano House\r\nbenchmark lowered a little more than three feet during May 1924 and\r\nthat places close to Halemaumau dropped nearly fifteen feet. This\r\nlowering of the mountain was graduated outward twenty miles from the\r\ncenter at trig stations, or concrete posts, in the Kau Desert and at\r\nstations along the road to Hilo. These stations changed altitude to\r\nshow that the big mountain tumefied or swelled up to that distance of\r\ntwenty miles during the big intrusion of cracks at the overflowing\r\ntime, as though the mountain dome were a tumor forty miles in diameter\r\nwith Halemaumau at the center. Of course there is no certainty that\r\nthe shore line in Puna, or even the Hilo tide gauge itself, did not go\r\ndown with the slumping of the mountain, for the thing called sea level\r\nis nothing but an average of tide gauge readings at a fixed wharf.\r\nRemember that the east point of Hawaii sank eight feet on the Kilauea\r\nrift during the April crisis.\r\n\r\nWilson also surveyed by horizontal triangulation in 1921, determining\r\nthat stations around Halemaumau had moved inward toward the center,\r\nby a specified number of feet, different at each station, and that\r\nother stations outside of Kilauea Crater had changed position\r\nhorizontally on the map, as though the mountain were shrinking. This\r\nentire series of measurements of change between 1911 and 1926 jibed\r\nwith the seismograph’s measurements of the tilting of the ground.\r\nThe seismograph picked out 1918, when Halemaumau overflowed, as the\r\nswelling year. In 1924 the tilt reversed itself, turning inward toward\r\nHalemaumau, and became tremendous when the pit collapsed and exploded.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to accent sufficiently the importance of the discovery\r\nof a measured swelling and slumping of a volcano throughout a lava\r\ncrisis occupying fifteen years. It was so tremendous that critical\r\nengineers in Washington refused to believe Wilson’s results. However,\r\nhis findings were verified by the contemporaneous lava measurement\r\nresults, earthquake enumerations, and tilt meter results. These showed\r\nthat earthquake frequency increased when Kilauea slumped and that a\r\nlava mountain had swelled until it was three feet higher at the summit\r\nin ten years and had contracted by a larger amount during the years of\r\nan explosive eruption period immediately thereafter. This all agrees\r\nwith the excellent results in Omori’s volcanic and seismic events,\r\nobtained by Japanese army and navy engineers at several volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes. It also agrees with the positive facts of Vesuvius and the\r\nCanary Islands, starting with the controversy about “elevation craters”\r\nstarted by Leopold von Buch in the first half of the nineteenth century\r\nand carried forward by Mercalli on Vesuvius in 1894 when a lava hill\r\nwas seen to swell up. There, too, others would not believe. The\r\nopposition always insisted that a volcano was built by heaped material,\r\nthat it could not possibly swell.\r\n\r\nWilson’s results are far-reaching, for the whole of geology depends\r\non uplift of continents and downsinking of sedimentary basins. Most\r\ngeologists account for these things by the theory of weighting and\r\nunderflow at a thin crust (isostasy), refusing to grant that volcanic\r\nheat and tumefaction yield intrusive power everywhere through cracks in\r\nthe deeper crust.\r\n\r\nI wish that I could describe adequately the high adventure of this\r\nfruitful time. We built a vehicle from a model T Ford with a Ruckstell\r\naxle, stripped of mudguards and equipped with balloon tires doubled at\r\nthe rear, so as to travel and carry loads over the smooth pahoehoe\r\nof the Kilauea floor. We found that a powerful light rig of this\r\ntype, with excessively low gear, could climb up on lava lobes one to\r\ntwo feet high. But this called for experienced driving and special\r\nmethods. Sending a man on foot ahead to pick a way and to drag a\r\ncrowbar which scratched a track, we could drive anywhere on the lava.\r\nAnd we used this rig to haul drums of water and drill apparatus. I once\r\ndrove artillery officers out over the rough floor of the crater, and\r\nafterwards saw similar cars used by the army in the first World War as\r\ncross-country transportation for the doctors and wounded in No Man’s\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nBefore a roadway encircled Kilauea Crater, Mr. Finch and I, carrying\r\ntwo-inch planks for bridging cracks, made the complete circuit of the\r\ncrater by way of the rifted Kau Desert in our special vehicle, which\r\nhas now been succeeded by the jeep, the most universal vehicle of World\r\nWar II. Volcanology prospected the field of war in more ways than one,\r\nso I named my popular book “Volcanoes declare war.”\r\n\r\nInventions led to expeditions both in Hawaii and in distant lands\r\nduring the decade of the twenties, some by invitation, some to offer\r\nassistance at disasters, and some for the natural extension of my own\r\nwork. On September 1, 1923, came the big earthquake at Tokyo. With\r\nMrs. Jaggar, I was permitted to land in Japan and make a study of the\r\neffects of the disaster. The destruction of Tokyo and Yokohama was a\r\nfinal, sad tragedy for Omori, who for years had worked to protect the\r\nEmperor and Japan by studying earthquake forecasts for Tokyo and by\r\nconducting research in earthquake-proof engineering. It was a cruel\r\ncommentary that the disaster came while he was attending a science\r\ncongress in Australia, particularly as the great destruction of life\r\nwas occasioned by fire and typhoon winds. But Omori’s organization\r\nhandled the seismic event admirably. Omori returned at once, but almost\r\nimmediately died.\r\n\r\nWe steamed into Yokohama harbor, were welcomed by Captain Gatesford\r\nLincoln U. S. N. and his destroyer flotilla. We went on board his\r\nflagship, and were sent in his launch to the broken jetties of\r\nYokohama, where we found no custom house or police. We walked up to the\r\ncamp of United States marines, amid the wreckage of the United States\r\nConsulate, where the Consul had been killed.\r\n\r\nYokohama, which I had known well in 1909 and 1914, was a tumble of\r\nruins; and the long Bund with its splendid waterfront structures,\r\nincluding the Grand Hotel, was a heap of rubble. My classmate\r\nPurington, a mining geologist who had been staying at the Grand with\r\nhis family escaped with one child and went back to rescue his wife. A\r\nsecond shock brought down more masonry and crushed him.\r\n\r\nWe were given a tent and allowed to mess with the marines, and next\r\nday we crowded into a train for Tokyo. It was packed to the doors and\r\nhad people seated on the roof. We were warned by Americans to dress\r\nas roughly as possible, as the populace was on edge, and foreigners\r\nmust not appear to be tourists. By great good luck we got into the\r\nImperial Hotel which had withstood the shake and fire, though it was\r\nconsiderably damaged.\r\n\r\nWe visited the Honjo district of the river bottom, where the damage\r\nwas at maximum, and we saw the remains of a pile of corpses, clothes,\r\nand household goods in one small yard where 30,000 people had been\r\nincinerated. Fire had closed in from all sides, and the shrieking\r\nmob of men, women, and children piled up on top of each other, amid\r\nhandcarts and clothing bundles--kindling which added fuel to the horror.\r\n\r\nThe mayor of Tokyo sent us in a small steamer to the island of Oshima,\r\non which is the volcano Mihara, close to the earthquake center. We\r\nclimbed up and looked down into a glowing pit which was making no lava\r\noutflow at the time, though Mihara is famous for basalt flows.\r\n\r\nWater soundings showed 900 feet of subsidence in Sagami Bay opposite\r\nOshima, and there were changed depths elsewhere, some of them\r\nshallowing by underwater land slips. We went to the Boshu Peninsula\r\neast of Tokyo, where the beach had been rising for many years, and\r\nwhere the earthquake rising left wharves high and dry. The principal\r\neffect of the earthquake, occurring at noon just when all charcoal\r\nbraziers were lighted for luncheon in the flimsy Japanese houses of\r\nwood and paper, was to set fires in an area of hundreds of square miles\r\nand a score of towns. Water reservoirs were destroyed, there was no\r\nadequate fire department to care for a conflagration, and a high wind\r\nwas blowing in the bright sunshine. A characteristic of Japanese cities\r\nwas the absence of open parkways for refugees, hence the crushing,\r\nburning, drowning, suffocation, and annihilation of hundreds of\r\nthousands of people and the destruction of factories, railroad trains,\r\nwater supplies, power plants, and every essential utility in a great\r\nmetropolitan area with a population of many millions. The horizontal\r\nmovement of the ground in the shock was about eight inches, and\r\naftershocks kept on for many months.\r\n\r\nWe explored Yokohama, clambering up to the Bluff where everything was\r\nwrecked and where land slips had tumbled down the precipice. We visited\r\nwhat remained of a beautiful English type villa with a slate roof,\r\nwhich had been occupied by two missionary ladies and their numerous\r\nparrots. These people were encamped, along with their parrots, in a\r\nshack built by their yardman, for the residence had tumbled down like a\r\nhouse of cards. One woman had been imprisoned between her bed and the\r\nwall, and was quite uninjured when the gardener dug her out through\r\ncracks of the roof.\r\n\r\nScientifically, what happened to the ground in this earthquake was\r\nnot explained by any single fault. Whatever happened to the bottom\r\nof Sagami Bay was not communicated across the beach to the coast as\r\nany great rift. Small faults were identified in a number of places,\r\nthe shoreline in one place lifted a few feet and lowered in another;\r\nbut no such movement as the big subsidence of the bottom of the bay\r\ncrossed the contact of sea and land. It appeared as though the margin\r\nof the bay itself outlined an area of sudden slumping, somehow related\r\nto Mihara Volcano on Oshima; but the shoreline of that island was not\r\nseriously affected. The great mountains of the foothills of Fujiyama,\r\nand the Hakone district, were shaken to a hash of broken railway\r\ntunnels and land slips, but the topography was not altered.\r\n\r\nA resurvey of trig stations west of Tokyo revealed movements that\r\nindicated the country had been spirally twisted. However, it has always\r\nseemed a mystery to me that all the motion on land was so small, when\r\nchange on the bottom of the bay was so great.\r\n\r\nThere was a local tidal wave at the bay shore of Kamakura, but no great\r\ntidal wave from the deep ocean came to Tokyo. Some volcanic effort of\r\ndeep lava had wedged open and jolted the sea bottom, but how it acted\r\nis entirely obscure. It was quite different from the San Francisco\r\nquake, with its side slip of twenty-one feet and a crack 400 miles long.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Japan in 1926 with the Pacific Science Congress,\r\nthe restoration of Tokyo was practically complete and a magnificent\r\ngreater city had been built with wide and large parkways. The\r\ngovernment was lavish in its entertainment of the scientists attending\r\nthe congress. Dr. Lacroix and I were sent to Osaka to lecture, and to\r\nshow lantern slides of Mount Pelée; and expeditions all over Japan were\r\narranged for the visitors. I had an opportunity to see for the first\r\ntime the large basaltic lava fields of the lake district at the base\r\nof Fujiyama, and I was astonished at the similarity of the basaltic\r\npahoehoe to our Hawaiian outflows and the freshness of the lavas and\r\nthe lava caverns. I had never thought of Fujiyama as a “lava flow”\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nMy next expedition was in the autumn of 1924, when I was invited by\r\nH. E. Gregory, Director of Bishop Museum, to go on an expedition\r\non the USS _Whippoorwill_, Commander Samuel King, to Howland\r\nand Baker Islands. Others on the expedition were C. Montague Cooke\r\n(malacologist), George Munro (ornithologist), Erling Christophersen\r\n(botanist), Ted Dranga (marine shell collector), George Collins (Museum\r\nTrustee), and Bruce Cartwright (naturalist). These men were invited to\r\nmake up one of several Bishop Museum parties which were sent out to\r\nsouth sea islands for collection and report.\r\n\r\nAs geologist, my job was to carry a portable seismograph and record\r\nearthquakes or microseisms and to take photographs. We had made up\r\nat the Observatory a one-component horizontal pendulum, in which\r\nthe chronograph drum used smoked paper. In camp I lowered the box\r\ncontaining the seismograph into a hole in the sand under my cot, with a\r\nview to finding out what tremors occurred on these flat coral islands.\r\nHowever, no movements were detected during the period of our stay,\r\nwithin the sensitivity limit of the small seismograph.\r\n\r\nHowland and Baker are coral islets, not atolls, close to the equator,\r\nwith no lagoons and with deep water all around them. Howland later\r\nbecame famous in the tragedy of Amelia Earhart, for whom the Coast\r\nGuard prepared an airfield on the island. These islands had been guano\r\ndiggings for parties from Honolulu fifty years earlier, and we found\r\nold cisterns and tracks. The islands were inhabited by thousands of\r\ngoonies (gannets), man-of-war birds, and terns. In some places they\r\ncovered the ground with their nests, eggs, and young, rising noisily\r\nin terrifying swarms as we walked among them. The land was perfectly\r\nflat brown guano and red weeds, with beaches of coral boulders and\r\n_Tridacna_, or giant clams, the highest bit ridges on the windward\r\nside. The easterly trade winds blew a powerful gale most of the time,\r\nand our ship had to land us on the leeward beaches, where we made our\r\ncamp in a line of tents. The staff was divided into pairs for each\r\ntent, and Filipino mess boys did the cooking.\r\n\r\nLanding was arduous, for there was heavy surf, even on the leeward\r\nside, and it was necessary to have a man swim in with a line in his\r\nteeth. The swimmer, Ted Dranga, made the line fast between a buoy and\r\nthe shore, then built a signal fire while the ship stood off. Men and\r\nbaggage were loaded into a skiff and hauled ashore by the sailor in the\r\nbow, who pulled, hand over hand, on the rope from the buoy, when the\r\nwaves were favorable. The ship had to drift away each night and come\r\nback, as there was no anchorage. A few stunted kou trees still survived\r\nfrom guano-digging days, and numerous grasses and fleshy-leaved salt\r\nweeds grew. The beaches were covered with rats, hermit crabs, and some\r\nwhite ghost crabs. The ghost crabs were seen at night flittering down\r\ninto the water when a flashlight was turned on the waves.\r\n\r\nThe hermit crabs, with borrowed shells, came clanking over the canvas\r\nfloor under our cots at night; and as one walked along the beach with a\r\nflashlight, Polynesian rats pattered away in all directions. They had\r\nbeen brought by the guano schooners and doubtless lived on shellfish,\r\nbirds, eggs, and fledglings.\r\n\r\nThe principal products of this expedition were notes, pictures, maps,\r\nand collections.\r\n\r\nWithin the next few years we were to combine expeditions with\r\nexperimentation in the organization of new observatories in California\r\nand Alaska.\r\n\r\nCalifornia volcanoes as a field of observatory study were an obvious\r\nchoice when Judge Cramton proposed enlargement of the volcano\r\nenterprise. He succeeded in getting me a Section of Volcanology in the\r\nGeological Survey, and I sent R. H. Finch to Lassen Volcanic National\r\nPark, where he made his headquarters at Mineral. Lassen had made\r\nsteamblast explosions in 1912 through 1914 which had rushed down into\r\nthe forest with such horizontal destruction as occurred at Mount Pelée.\r\nIt was not realized that this blast was terrible, for it was in the\r\nbackwoods on top of the Sierra Nevada and little known. The national\r\npark there was created later. It is an area with a recent (1871?)\r\ncinder cone and rocky lava flow, boiling lakes and mud pots, numerous\r\nsolfataras and hot springs, and a lava cavern much like those on Hawaii.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _21.

Lava flow of 1926 Mauna Loa eruption\r\n  approaching Hoopuloa Village, which was destroyed. Photo section\r\n  U.S. Army Air Force_]\r\n\r\nLassen Peak is the southernmost volcano on the line where the\r\nCascade Range merges with the Sierra Nevada. The line of volcanoes\r\nextends beyond Mount Baker into Canada. North of Lassen is the Glass\r\nMountain region where there are obsidian lava flows. Like Mount\r\nShasta, Lassen is a volcano of very few recent eruptions, but there\r\nwere at least two outbreaks in the nineteenth century. These two\r\nvolcanoes resemble Pelée and Soufrière. Their linear quality implies\r\na long ragged rift in the earth’s crust, and south of Lassen there\r\nis suggested an offset rift at Mount St. Helena, near the famous\r\nsuperheated steam of Geyserville. This is near the northern end of the\r\ngreat San Andreas rift, which extends many hundreds of miles southeast\r\nof San Francisco. The rift shifted in a north-south direction during\r\nthe earthquake of 1906, and is one of the many evidences that the\r\nnorth-south faults of California are all a part of the faulting up,\r\nover lava, of the Cordillera, relative to downsunken Pacific Ocean\r\nslabs.\r\n\r\nI put Finch in charge of Aleutian Islands seismographs, as well as\r\nthe one he was to establish at Mineral. With Wilson as seismologist\r\nand instrument designer in Hawaii, we started constructing horizontal\r\npendulums, like those used in Hawaii, making the weights out of\r\nlarge iron pipes, to be filled with sand at the place of operation.\r\nThese were two-component seismographs, recording on a single\r\nchronograph drum. We sent one to the Coast Survey station at Sitka\r\nand built two more for Kodiak and Unalaska. Finch built and set up\r\nhis own seismograph at Mineral. He started systematic surveys of the\r\ntemperatures of hot springs and steam jets in different parts of\r\nLassen Park and kept close contact with the Geological Department of\r\nthe University of California at Berkeley. Lassen was the subject of\r\ngeological surveys by Anderson and Finch, and later the park area was\r\nstudied by Howel Williams.\r\n\r\nI went to Washington to see government authorities, particularly\r\nProfessor Charles F. Marvin, Chief of the Weather Bureau, and Dr. G.\r\nO. Smith, Director of the Geological Survey. I can never express my\r\nindebtedness to Marvin, a good designer who built an inverted pendulum\r\nseismograph in Washington. Finch had worked with Marvin when he was\r\nweather observer in airplanes based on Ireland during the first World\r\nWar. Hence methods of government contact and reports, in the early days\r\nof our Observatory, were kindly guided by Marvin. The Weather Bureau\r\nwas a place of self-recording instruments, something new for geology,\r\nand much needed for volcano observation. For weather is a matter of\r\npresent changes, whereas geology had long been a matter of ancient\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nDirector Smith was instrumental in calling a meeting in Washington,\r\nof scientists of all bureaus interested in the Aleutian Islands. I\r\nwas selected to lead the symposium, which included representatives\r\nof climatology, biology and fisheries, geology and geochemistry,\r\noceanography and geodesy, hydrographic charting, gravity, and\r\nmagnetism. There proved to be great interest in the Alaskan Peninsula\r\nand the islands, and the Survey published a special bulletin on the\r\nsymposium.\r\n\r\nW. C. Mendenhall, who had written a monograph on the volcano of Mount\r\nWrangell in the great bend of the continent around the Gulf of Alaska,\r\nbecame director of the Geological Survey and one of my best friends.\r\n\r\nIn 1927 I was ready with cross-country cars and a seismograph to\r\nexplore once more the volcanoes of Alaska. Organizing an expensive\r\nexpedition which called for a special ship was obviously out, but\r\nin the years after the Technology Expedition of 1907 I had learned\r\nmany economies which I wanted to try out. Also I had two experimental\r\nand mechanical tests to make. The first was to set up in Alaska\r\na seismograph, the second was to test Alaskan beaches with a\r\ncross-country car, with a view to building an amphibian boat. I had\r\nread in several languages on the subject of motor vehicles with boat\r\nbodies, and my 1907 experience of finding no anchorage on Umnak Island\r\nhad convinced me of the need for a vessel on wheels which could climb\r\nup an Alaskan beach and be converted into a camp. So I started from\r\nSeattle with a low gear Ford runabout. I unloaded it first in Kodiak\r\nvillage, where there were only one or two cars, and made tests of\r\ndriving it along beaches.\r\n\r\nAt Kodiak the Agricultural Experiment Station allowed me to set up the\r\nseismograph in a vacant basement, and I arranged with a local housewife\r\nto operate the instrument. Aided by a sheet of instructions, she made\r\ntests, changed the smoked papers, varnished them, mailing them to\r\nHawaii, and kept notes on earthquakes which were felt.\r\n\r\nThe roadster and I then traveled by the local mailboat steamer\r\n_Starr_, Captain Johanssen, and sailed along the south shore of\r\nthe Alaskan Peninsula to King Cove, visiting Bradford on the way.\r\nDisembarking at King Cove, I made runs on the beach with the car. With\r\nthe aid of the cannery mechanic, I tried attaching winch spools to\r\ndrive wheels, in order to haul the car up to grassy land behind the\r\nbeach. No car had ever landed at the cannery, there were no roads,\r\nand the problem of getting from the wharf to the tundra, and from\r\nthe tundra to the beach and back again, posed practical mechanical\r\nproblems, the solution of which was to be useful later. We ran along\r\nthe beach as far as a rocky headland, until we needed an amphibian boat\r\nin which to round the point and rejoin the stony beach at some place\r\nbeyond. How that boat body should be constructed was planned from this\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent, the physician, and the boatbuilders of the large\r\nKing Cove cannery planned an exploration for me, with John Gardner as\r\nboatman and Peter Yatchmeneff as his mate. These two were on their way\r\nto hunt bears for an eastern museum and were going to Pavlof Volcano,\r\nthe Vesuvius of the Alaskan Peninsula. I transferred my baggage to\r\ntheir motor sloop, the _Plug Ugly_, and we headed for Pavlof Bay.\r\n\r\nAt Volcano Bay we landed for a bear hunt, which was very exciting for\r\nme. When we found bear tracks in an amphitheater under big mountains,\r\nwe climbed toward the divide at the head; but we could find no pass\r\nover it. From the high ground we looked across the river at clumps of\r\nalders. John borrowed my field glass, handed it back, and pointed out\r\na black spot far away under the bushes. “I just saw it move,” he said,\r\n“that spot is a big brown bear where he has been holed up.”\r\n\r\nI remained watching while John and Pete, with their 25-caliber Savage\r\ncarbines, crept across the valley bottom, keeping down the wind from\r\nthe bear in the shelter of bushes. I saw that they were getting very\r\nclose to the game, lost sight of them for a few minutes, then heard two\r\nsharp cracks and saw the bear in violent motion, thrashing around and\r\ntearing up the ground, then quickly subsiding. I made my way across the\r\nvalley and found they had neatly shot a year old Alaskan brown bear.\r\nThe rest of the day was given to skinning it, and we sank the skull,\r\ntied to a fish line from the sloop, to the bottom of the bay where\r\nmarine organisms would eat away remaining flesh and leave the bone\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nNext we sailed up to the head of Pavlof Bay and camped at a barabara,\r\nor sod hut, preparatory to a trek to a small volcano that lies near a\r\nshallow lake on the north side of the magnificent pair of snowy volcano\r\ncones known as Pavlof and Pavlof Sister. We were early in the season\r\nand could see a glacier extending down from Pavlof Crater, which is a\r\ncup containing a conelet at the side of the summit. The crater is like\r\na collar, the conelet like the knot of a necktie, while the glacier\r\nis the ribbon of the necktie, itself, extending down to a jumble of\r\nsnowy hills with rocky moraines at the edge of the lake. We made camp\r\nand ran into some adverse weather, and also into a party of mainland\r\nsportsmen. We gave up further hunting and returned to King Cove, for\r\nJohn had his bear and that was enough. The curved beauty of the Pavlof\r\ncones, with a sweep of lava flows to the west of them, heavily mantled\r\nwith snow, was exquisite and a knowledge of the cones was useful when\r\nplans were made for a later expedition.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jaggar, after a trip by way of the Yukon into the interior of\r\nAlaska waited for me at Kodiak while I took Captain Johanssen’s SS\r\n_Starr_ to Unalaska where I saw my friends of the Coast Guard and\r\nreceived an invitation to go later on the _Unalga_ to Attu. I\r\nstayed on the _Starr_ to Bristol Bay on the Bering Sea side, in\r\norder to see the Alaskan Peninsula from the north.\r\n\r\nA rewarding view showed me the almost inaccessible Aghileen Pinnacles,\r\na marvelous mountain west of Pavlof, consisting of dozens of upright\r\nspires, all covered with ice, and looking like a cluster of cathedrals\r\nin a snow storm. At the head of Bristol Bay I saw one of the government\r\nIndian schools, met some of the teachers, and met trappers who came\r\non board with interesting collections of fox furs. They told me about\r\nNaknek Lake, which gives access to Katmai from that side by dog sled in\r\nwinter. The necessary husky dogs were tied out in the fields around a\r\nmission station.\r\n\r\nA rumpus on deck between a storekeeper of the district and the United\r\nStates Marshall arose over a feud between two villages which were\r\nquarreling about the placing of a United States post office. There was\r\nno shooting, though it looked bad for a few minutes, and I realized the\r\nfar north was a replica of the far west.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Unalaska, Coast Guard officers and I were invited to\r\na dinner on board the German cruiser and training ship _Emden_.\r\nI had nothing to wear but a hunting coat, whereas the others were in\r\ndress uniforms, but the Germans didn’t mind. I greatly enjoyed the\r\n_Emden’s_ officers, whom I heard from later, including Captain\r\nFoerster, an acquaintance of my son in Seattle.\r\n\r\nOn board the _Unalga_ I was given the Captain’s cabin, for he was\r\nabsent on sick leave. Executive Officer Perkins, who acted as skipper,\r\npreferred to live in his own quarters. Another guest on the trip to\r\nAttu was Jack McCord, whose interests were sheep herding and whaling,\r\ntwo industries which were making experimental progress in the islands.\r\nWe saw a sheep ranch in the western part of Unalaska Island and learned\r\nthat a recent landing on Bogoslof had found the conditions much like\r\nthose I had seen in 1907 when I noted the smoking cone, the millions of\r\nmurres, the three islands, the connecting beaches, the warm lagoon, and\r\nthe dozens of sea lions.\r\n\r\nAt Nikolski on the west end of Umnak Island, a flat land where\r\nsedimentary rocks appeared, we had to mine and blow up a schooner\r\nrecently sunk in the harbor. Going westward, we passed cones in groups\r\nor on individual islands, and we met the usual fogs and gales. The\r\nofficers were interested in Adak Harbor, but our plan to enter it was\r\ndefeated by storms.\r\n\r\nWe anchored off Chugul, where two Aleutian men and a boy had been\r\nmarooned for months by the non-return of the wrecked schooner. A trader\r\nhad leased the island and left them to collect blue foxes for him. When\r\ntheir supplies gave out, they lived on fish, vegetation, eggs, and sea\r\nbirds. They had matches left but no ammunition, so they had loaded\r\ncartridges by assembling match ends. However, they were sheltered in a\r\nsod hut at one side of the grassy volcano, and were living proof that\r\nan Aleut cannot starve. They were fat and healthy and had a good load\r\nof furs. When we transported them to the village on Attu, the first\r\nthing one of these men did was to marry an Attu girl, with the aid of\r\nthe local priest.\r\n\r\nChugul was the last of the shapely volcanic cones. Attu geology was\r\ndifferent, with old metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and ancient\r\nlavas, but without any sign of fresh volcanoes. It is a mountainous\r\nisland with deep fjords, and we crossed a divide in order to look down\r\non Sarana Bay, made famous by World War II. McCord and I walked out on\r\nthe peninsula west of the village of Chernofski, and saw snowy ranges\r\nbeyond the next bay to the west. The Aleutian uplands are covered\r\nwith luxurious grasses, many flowers, and much mossy swamp; and there\r\nare signs of terracing in places, as though made by old elevated\r\nbeaches. The country is too wet and stormy to be attractive for raising\r\nlivestock. However, when we landed on Amchitka Island on the south side\r\nof the chain, we found it drier with fine grassy uplands. We found also\r\nthe usual shore cliffs and foxes.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Unalaska, where I was attracted by the empty hotel\r\nbuilding and wharves at Dutch Harbor, deserted by the Alaska Commercial\r\nCompany after the booming maritime trade of the Cape Nome gold days. I\r\ntalked to Company officers about using the buildings as a scientific\r\nstation. An old powder house would be suitable for a seismograph\r\ncellar; the wireless station was nearby; and there was water, lumber,\r\nand housing for every possible purpose. It was ideal for an Aleutian\r\ngeophysical station, if financing and collaboration could be had.\r\nLater, in Seattle, I addressed the Chamber of Commerce and published in\r\nour Bulletin a proposal for an Aleutian Geographical Observatory, but\r\nnothing came of it at that time. The Aleutian Islands became a center\r\nfor landing craft, airfields, and defense forces during World War II,\r\nand eventually our men Howard Powers and Austin Jones were employed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn 1928, Gilbert Grosvenor of the National Geographic Society, in\r\ncooperation with the Geological Survey, equipped me with an expedition\r\nto map, photograph, and survey 2,500 square miles in the vicinity\r\nof Pavlof Volcano. Again I had John Gardner and Pete as camp men.\r\nMcKinley, our topographer, brought pack animals and Alex Bradford\r\ntransported us to our base camp in Canoe Bay. I slept during summer\r\nin the _Honukai_, a twin-screw steel amphibian boat, which was\r\nmanufactured in Chicago, after a preliminary vessel made of wood\r\nand impelled by paddle wheels had been constructed at our Hawaiian\r\nObservatory shop and tried out over a 400-mile course along the shores\r\nof Hawaii.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the preliminary vessel, which we called _Ohiki_,\r\nHawaiian for ghost crab, took place during the spring of 1928. The\r\nentire staff of our Observatory were engaged in it, with Mrs. Jaggar\r\nas stewardess, as usual. Mr. Thurston went along as a passenger and\r\npublicity man on the trip up the west coast of Hawaii, where I tested\r\nout Kona beaches and checked on the craft’s seaworthiness.\r\n\r\nWe had misadventure at the start, in that the driving wheels tended to\r\ndig in on soft beaches; and we found it necessary to build washboards\r\nto raise the gunwhale amidships to avoid shipping water in choppy seas.\r\nIn the cross country trek from Kilauea, using the boat as a truck, Mr.\r\nThurston was overwhelmed with admiration for the twenty-one foot work\r\nskiff, thundering down the steep hills of Kona on wheels, controlled by\r\nthe low gears of a Ford. Its boat body excited all the roadside kids to\r\nwild antics of delight. My excellent truck builder, Boyrie, used the\r\nsame Ford which had run along the beaches in Alaska, reconstructing it\r\nin the observatory machine shop.\r\n\r\nWilson’s photograph of the _Ohiki_, with Mr. Thurston on board,\r\nbecame the frontispiece of a top secret publication on amphibians of\r\nWorld War II’s joint army staffs in London. The amphibian war of the\r\nPacific Ocean and Normandy was to develop dozens of different designs\r\nof landing craft, but war use was unforeseen by me at the time of our\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nWith a crew of four we cruised from Kailua to Kawaihae along the west\r\ncoast of Hawaii, landing on beaches and lava flows, and camping at\r\nMakalawena, Kiholo, and Puako. We encountered real grief at Kawaihae\r\nagainst the front of a soft submerged bank in shallow water, where the\r\nfront wheels made too much resistance and the rear wheels dug into a\r\nmud bottom. We needed front wheel pull, but we finally got the craft up\r\nthe beach by power hauling with gypsy and cable and a tree. More grief\r\ndeveloped on our way up to Waimea when we fractured wooden rear axle\r\nattachments. We went gratefully into the Parker Ranch shop for some\r\ndays, until we were able to return to Hilo and the volcano, completing\r\nthe circuit of the island.\r\n\r\nThe National Geographic vessel was built by George Powell who\r\nadvertised a Ford “mobileboat,” designed for the use of fishermen to\r\nenter midcontinent lakes. He had started on a larger model, which\r\nGrosvenor accepted for the National Geographic Expedition. Powell and\r\nI tried it out on Bellingham roads and lakes and on beaches of Puget\r\nSound. We provided everything extra, for Alaska had no roadside filling\r\nstations. A wheeled vehicle on the peninsula was unheard of. We had\r\nelongate steel mats to give traction across the upper sands of a beach,\r\nand this plus bow winch, levers, and manpower enabled us to abandon\r\nbeaches and enter the tundra. Our planning paid off, for in the 400\r\nmiles along the coast of Alaska from Shumagin Islands to King Cove,\r\nover water, beaches, and tundra, we did not even have to pump up the\r\ntires. The _Honukai’s_ numerous excessively low gears even enabled\r\nus to drive to the snowline and bring out the heavy fur and bones of a\r\nbear that I had shot on a snowy volcano, Mount Dana.\r\n\r\nThe expedition was very productive. McKinley made an excellent\r\ntopographic map; we corrected errors in old maps; we obtained many\r\nphotographs through Richard Stewart, who carried still, color, and\r\nmovie cameras; and we obtained minerals, fossils, geologic notes, and\r\nmany plants which I collected. McKinley used a panorama camera for his\r\ntopographic work and his wide photographs were invaluable as a record\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I kept in tough with the seismograph station at Kodiak. The\r\nsteamers of the Pacific Commercial Company, which owned several of the\r\ncanneries and had headquarters in Bellingham, transported us from\r\nPuget Sound to King Cove, and the many tugs for the canneries’ salmon\r\ntraps enabled me to make local explorations along the southern coast.\r\nAt one trap the fishermen had a tame baby seal, who would eat nothing\r\nbut little trout caught for him from the brook. He lived in a box,\r\nand went off to sea by himself at night; but he always came home next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIn 1929 Finch sent Austin Jones, a seismologist, to construct and\r\nestablish a hut at the Dutch Harbor radio station for a second Alaskan\r\nseismograph, of the Hawaiian type designed by R. M. Wilson. Jones\r\ntaught the wife of a radio operator to manipulate the station and\r\ntransmit the seismograms. The women in charge of the two stations at\r\nKodiak and Dutch Harbor kept their work up for several years, and kept\r\nin constant correspondence with me. Though in the winter time they had\r\nto dig the stations out of snowdrifts, and to cope with all kinds of\r\ndamage from rain and storm, they courageously and faithfully visited\r\nthe instruments. It is a hellish country for weather.\r\n\r\nAlthough both stations were within fifty miles of active volcanoes,\r\nearthquakes were not numerous, and the story was very different from\r\nthat told by our records made at the edge of Kilauea caldera, only two\r\nmiles from an active lava center. Thus we have demonstrated that the\r\nonly way to study an active volcano is to live close to the crater\r\nitself, even if a shelter has to be built underground.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this story of our Alaskan expeditions of the twenties, in\r\ncontrast to my windjamming experience of 1907, I must underscore the\r\nimportance of water transportation and credit those who have provided\r\nit. In fact, all transportation was by water until aircraft became\r\nsupplemental. I feel that the U.S. Coast Guard, which takes care of the\r\nPribilof Island seals, is the supreme achievement of our government in\r\npolicing these stormy waters. Their 60-foot motor cruiser, equipped\r\nwith sails has come to be standard for such government bureaus as\r\nthe Biological Survey and has replaced the earlier, 80-foot sealing\r\nschooner among the traders.\r\n\r\nThe canneries maintain big boatbuilding yards and operate large and\r\npowerful tugs for visiting the salmon traps. The traps are heavy\r\nweirs made of northwest pine logs, which are battered to pieces by\r\nthe winter storms and must be rebuilt with pile drivers every spring.\r\nThus a by product of cannery activities, and a godsend for trappers,\r\nfishermen, Aleuts, and campers is the pine lumber distributed all along\r\nthe beaches from the annual wreckage of salmon traps. It is the only\r\nfirewood and construction material of the country to be found anywhere\r\nwest of Kodiak, for the land has no forests.\r\n\r\nOur contribution to the boating problem was the exhibition of what an\r\namphibian landing truck will do on Alaskan beaches and its usefulness\r\nalong those beaches where a boat may be in difficulties from stormy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nI returned to my Hawaii headquarters in the fall of 1928. The year 1929\r\nwas marked by an earthquake crisis which began in mid-September with an\r\nunusual number of shocks in the vicinity of Hualalai Volcano, a place\r\nhitherto notably free from earthquakes. This was of interest because\r\nevents on Mauna Loa had shown higher and higher lava sources and quake\r\ncenters for the south rift. The 1926 outflow had begun by splitting\r\nnorthward across the summit crater, and there making a considerable\r\nflow eastward toward Wood Valley while Wingate and his topographic\r\nparty were in camp close to the summit. Therefore, when the 1929 quakes\r\nbegan near Puuwaawaa, it looked as though Mauna Loa eruptions might\r\nbegin again at the northwest.\r\n\r\nA very strong quake of September 25 was felt all over the island, and\r\nin our seismograph cellar was a peculiar swaying movement that set\r\nall the instruments jiggling, dismantled recording pens, and produced\r\na queer feeling that the building was floating like a boat in a\r\nwhirlpool. Immediately came word that North Kona had suffered heavily,\r\nparticularly at Puuwaawaa Ranch near the cone of that name, where the\r\n1859 Mauna Loa flow had swept past.\r\n\r\nI motored at once with Mrs. Jaggar to Puuwaawaa, where we were\r\nhospitably entertained by the family of Mrs. Robert Hind. The damage\r\nall about was fantastic, with houses pulled apart, stone walls flung\r\ndown in a seaward direction, redwood water tanks wrecked, and shops\r\non the lower side of the highway moved toward the sea leaving a chasm\r\nbetween them and the road. Resting in our bedroom, we could hear the\r\nwindow frames ticking like clocks for long periods of time, then coming\r\nto a sudden wrench which felt as though a lifting wave had passed\r\nthrough the mountain under us.\r\n\r\nI returned to the Observatory to get a shock recorder for use at the\r\nranch porch to count these strong motion shocks. Meanwhile residents in\r\nKona jotted down times of the shocks, which were coming by hundreds. On\r\nOctober 5 at about 6 P.M., as I was returning through North\r\nKona in my car, I noticed a little unexplained excitement among people\r\nby the roadside. I stopped at the residence of Frank Greenwell, whose\r\nwife was a faithful counter of quakes, to find Mrs. Greenwell and her\r\ndaughter on the veranda in tears. They had just been through fearful\r\nearthquakes, which in a moving car I had not felt. Flower vases were\r\noverturned, furniture was disarranged, dishes were flung off the dining\r\nroom table, and kitchen utensils and milk were in a jumble. It was hard\r\nto believe that anything so terrific could have happened without my\r\nfeeling it.\r\n\r\nI found even more dire catastrophe at Puuwaawaa. The stone chimney was\r\noverturned, breakage of china and of glass in the preserve closet in\r\nthe basement was severe, a stone bench was flung down and broken on\r\nthe lawn, and one side of the cellar was caved in. We took to living\r\nin automobiles, for there had been land slips on the mountain. This\r\nearthquake had been worse than that of September 25. Even hillside\r\ncottages were split apart.\r\n\r\nI set up the shock recorder, which registered about 3,000 earthquakes\r\nduring the next three months, until mid-December. The intensity and\r\nfrequency of these quakes declined, as is usual with aftershocks of\r\na big earthquake, recalling 1868 and the south end of the island. At\r\nthat time both Mauna Loa and Kilauea had had rift outflows, and as the\r\nseismographic center of the new earthquakes was close to the 1800 and\r\n1859 flows from Hualalai and Mauna Loa, everybody expected a lava flow;\r\nbut none came. Armine von Tempski who was a visitor during this period\r\nwas inspired to write “Lava.” She added a Hualalai lava flow using\r\nmaterial that I gave her to describe it. Her description is magnificent\r\nalthough she, herself, had never seen a lava flow.\r\n\r\nThe October 5 shock was bad on the west flank of Mauna Kea, where\r\nwater tanks were overturned and the high wireless station was damaged,\r\nand at Kamuela, where plumbing pipes were fractured. Parker Ranch was\r\ndamaged, and the constant racking along the entire length of the Kona\r\nsettlements caused land slips and broken masonry in many places, always\r\ndamaging north-south stone fences more than those at right angles to\r\nthe seashore.\r\n\r\nThis three months of northwest earthquakes, a condition unknown since\r\n1801, the year when Hualalai lava flowed into the sea, indicated that\r\nlava was coming north of Mauna Loa. This had not happened since 1899,\r\nfor the flows on the southwest rift, always beginning near the summit\r\ncrater, had been during 1903, 1907, 1914, 1916, 1919, and 1926.\r\n\r\nBelief was that the southwestern rift of the mountain was filling\r\nprogressively higher with solidified redhot cement, not brittle enough\r\nto fracture open easily, whereas the northern rifts--such as the\r\nsources of 1859, 1881, and 1899--were now hard and brittle and ready\r\nfor fracture. The fracturing took the form of northwest cracking and\r\nthis was lava wedging, confirmed by the summit and northern outflows\r\nwhich were to come in 1933 and 1935.\r\n\r\nJuly of 1929 produced a new influx of lava into Halemaumau, nineteen\r\ndegrees north of the equator. And a curiously simultaneous event\r\noccurred on nearly the same date 2,000 miles away at Tin Can Island\r\n(Niuafoou) in Tonga where the influx broke into basaltic eruption\r\nfifteen degrees south of the equator. Apparently a stress lagging\r\nbehind the solstice time had acted on the equatorial protuberance to\r\nrelease the wedging open of lava fractures on both sides of the equator.\r\n\r\nI was pleased when the U.S. Naval Observatory invited me to go to\r\nNiuafoou in 1930 as the geologist on an expedition going to study\r\nthe total eclipse of the sun. The expedition, under Captain C. H.\r\nC. Keppler, used the Naval Station at Samoa as a base. Mrs. Jaggar\r\naccompanied me as far as Pago Pago and made trips to Western Samoa,\r\nFiji, and the Tonga Islands. With other wives of expedition members,\r\nshe was allowed to make a short visit to Tin Can Island at the time of\r\nthe eclipse in October. Spending some time in Samoa, she listened to\r\nthe Congressional hearings under Senator Hiram Bingham, which were to\r\ninvestigate civil versus naval government. We were delighted to find\r\nour old friend Captain Lincoln, of Tokyo earthquake relief, in command\r\nof the Navy at Samoa, and I also renewed acquaintance with the pilot of\r\nmy companion plane in the Molokai forced landing of 1924, Lieutenant\r\nBill Sinton, and his family, whom we were to meet again in Honolulu.\r\nProminent on Captain Keppler’s staff was Lieutenant-Commander Kellers,\r\nphysician and naturalist, whose enterprise on the Niuafoou expedition,\r\nlike mine, dealt with sciences other than astronomy.\r\n\r\nFrom the sea, Niuafoou looks like a hat in shape. It is about five\r\nmiles in diameter with eleven villages, mostly along the eastern\r\nshores, and at that time had a population of about a thousand people.\r\nIn the center is a circular lake, bordered by cliffs, and much like\r\nCrater Lake in Oregon. Standing about seventy feet above sea level\r\nand 250 feet deep, it has slightly brackish water. The naval camp was\r\nestablished at Angaha on the north side of the island, and here a new\r\nvillage housed the refugees from Futu to the northwest, destroyed in\r\n1929 by an aa lava flow. This flow came from erupting cracks trending\r\nnorth and south, along the west side of the ring ridge around the\r\ncrater lake. These lava flows had been liquid pahoehoe at the source;\r\nhad poured into the sea in many places; and had made striking tree\r\nmolds around coconut palms, which were left as stone trees when the\r\nwood burned and the liquid lava lowered. The western source crack\r\nextends to the south end of the island and has accounted for most of\r\nthe earlier eruptions known to history. Futu had been the only western\r\nsettlement left.\r\n\r\nAngaha came nearest to being a harbor, but was really on an open\r\nroadstead, with a rocky boat landing and copra chute below the village\r\nwhich stood on a cliff above.\r\n\r\nCopra, the only commercial product, is bought and warehoused by two\r\nAustralian firms. The two grown sons of the manager of one assisted\r\nme in tramping and photographing all over the island. The landing\r\nat Angaha brought about the name Tin Can Island, for the visiting\r\nsteamers stopped a mile off shore and incoming mail, soldered into\r\nlarge biscuit tins by the steamship engineer, was lowered into the\r\nsea, tied together. The tins were towed in by the village policeman.\r\nOutgoing mail was carried out in paper packages tied on top of sticks\r\nand held aloft by hardy swimmers with hau wood poles, which they held\r\nunder their arms as floats. A short time after our trip a shark got a\r\nswimmer, and canoes were adopted.\r\n\r\nThanks to the infrequent visits of vessels, the natives were unspoiled,\r\nsplendid specimens of the Polynesian race. The laws of Tonga required\r\nevery youth to cultivate an area of coconut trees and vegetables, and\r\nthe island was traversed by lovely trails. The houses and churches were\r\nexquisite arched structures with thatched roofs, the beams tied with\r\ncoconut-fiber cords. There were native ministers, and the choirs were\r\nsuperb. Services often started at 4 A.M.\r\n\r\nMy jobs were to take photographs with three cameras and make a\r\ngeological map. Northeast of the crater lake is a cluster of sand\r\nhills, relics of an unusual explosive eruption in 1878, another\r\nHawaiian eruption date. This eruption was confined to one side of\r\nthe crater and came up the wall crack, between the encircling cliff\r\nand the top of the lava plug under the lake. Its description is very\r\nreminiscent of the Kilauea steamblasts of 1924.\r\n\r\nWe found a remarkable inhabitant of the sand in the malau bird, a small\r\npartridge with big feet, with which it dug a deep hole in the sand for\r\nits large egg which was then covered up. The sun’s heat did the rest,\r\nwith the warm sand acting as incubator. The young bird scratched its\r\nway to freedom and flight without aid from its mother. Another item of\r\nDr. Kellers’ natural history was the flying fox, a giant bat with a\r\nhigh singing note and odoriferous rookeries in the tops of trees. It\r\nhad a heavy flight like an eagle’s. A third item was the tiny black\r\ncrab, the size of a ten-cent piece, which lived in the midst of limey\r\nflats at one side of the lake, where there were crusts that suggested\r\ncalcareous algae. The little black crabs, which lived by thousands in\r\nthe midst of the crust, resembled compact spiders.\r\n\r\nAn artificial feature of great convenience was a trail following the\r\ntop of the ring ridge, all around the crater. The Quensell boys had\r\na rowboat on the lake, and Dr. Kellers and I were guided by them to\r\nall parts of the island, making the acquaintance of the people in the\r\nvillages along the eastern trade-wind shore. Just as in Hawaii, the\r\ntrade wind is a controlling feature; and the surf erodes cliffs on\r\nthe east, whereas beaches are more common along the lava flows of the\r\nwestern strand line. These are sheltered from wind but are remote from\r\nhabitations. The entire island is made of lava and ash deposits, and is\r\nevidently the top of a volcano cone extending far below sea level. The\r\nlava activity, as shown by the arrangement of the old and new source\r\ncracks, depends on concentric cracking around the caldera, which makes\r\nconcentric rifts, rather than the long radial ones found in Hawaii. The\r\ncrack along the west side--which had vented the succession of flows\r\nfrom south to north, ending with the Futu flow of 1929--indicated that\r\nthe next flow might threaten Angaha. This is just what happened during\r\nthe next decade, forcing the island population to be evacuated.\r\n\r\nMy geology photographs and pictures of people, ships, and dwellings\r\nwere developed in a darkroom tent, which I set up in a copra shed, so\r\nas to keep the development of negatives abreast of the exposures. Copra\r\nbugs crawling over me in the dark and getting into developer added\r\nexcitement, and the eternal smell of copra began to tinge my dreams.\r\n\r\nThe routine of our work was broken by two good fights, a fist fight\r\nbetween a Filipino steward and a sailor, and a knock-down and drag-out\r\nbetween two native women of Angaha. The real fun was the row between\r\nthe two women. A younger woman who was a loose, shrill character,\r\ndisliked by the villagers and the sailors, attempted to attack an\r\nolder woman who was a big husky dame. There was screaming and hair\r\npulling and fisticuffs, while the Navy men stood around and cheered\r\nthem on. The younger woman made most of the noise, while the older\r\nwoman laughed and ripped off the other’s clothes. Finally the young\r\nwoman, in tears and with clothing in tatters, retreated and disappeared.\r\n\r\nBut to get back to the eclipse, telescope lenses were mounted on high\r\nscaffolds, the ladies arrived in October, and the total eclipse of the\r\nsun happened and was photographed at the time anticipated.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for us to return to Samoa, some of us were fortunate\r\nenough to get a place on the Flood Brothers’ copra ship _Carisso_,\r\nout of San Francisco. Along with the family of a Navy officer, we went\r\nashore at Niuatoputapu (Keppel Island) after climbing down a rope\r\nladder to a bobbing whale boat. We found beautiful mats, which are the\r\nwealth of the people throughout Tonga. The village men and women who\r\nhad mats to sell were not so much interested in coins or trinkets and\r\nmerchandise as they were in the clothing we wore. I literally divested\r\nmyself of a shirt and a suit for a beautiful fringed mat ornamented\r\nwith clusters of shells, made to be given to Queen Charlotte on her\r\nnext visit. We were fortunate in reaching Samoa in good weather, but\r\na big storm after we got there wrought havoc with the _Tanager_\r\ncarrying astronomical photo plates and bundles of Polynesian mats which\r\nwere much damaged by sea water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                           Prophecy and Hope\r\n\r\n           “_For we know in part, and we prophesy in part._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth decade of my sixty years of geology, 1931 through 1940, was\r\na time of culmination at Kilauea; the ending of an eleven-year cycle\r\non Mauna Loa; and the introduction, in 1940, of a new Mauna Loa cycle.\r\nThis new cycle resembled strikingly the one which followed 1843 because\r\nof the similarity of places--notably the north side of Mauna Loa toward\r\nHumuula, followed by the northeast side toward Hilo--and the intervals\r\nof eruption. Kilauea behaved differently in the nineteenth century,\r\nbecause in 1840 it rent open the east flank to make a flood of lava\r\ninto the ocean, though afterwards it restored its lava to Halemaumau.\r\n\r\nIn 1934, on the other hand, Halemaumau went to sleep, after adding one\r\nmore extra thick filling in the bottom of Halemaumau pit in September,\r\nwhen it gushed up behind wall slabs 300 feet high, cascading down the\r\ntalus in twenty-five ribbons of lava. This proved that effervescence in\r\na small crack can rise far above the level of the lava lake in the pit.\r\nIt made a marvelous display in early morning darkness, and the new lava\r\nlake rose rapidly within the flatly funneling talus. This lay at thirty\r\ndegrees, so that the outward spread enlarged the lake and reached\r\nbeyond the foot of the talus.\r\n\r\nThe slide-rock slope that was conspicuous had been fed by avalanches,\r\nand it rested against the half-circle of wall slab, behind which had\r\nrisen the cascades. This source migrated around the slab to the north\r\nand developed the biggest fountaining jets there. By the outward and\r\nupward spread of the new lake these jets became lake fountains, while\r\nthe cascading ribbons at the slope stopped. The lake rose and crusted\r\nover. The northern fountains became a small oval pond and center of\r\naccumulation and upward doming, while pahoehoe lava radiated down a\r\nslope to the edges of the floor heap, south and east. Surveys at this\r\ntime placed the northern lava pond definitely at the top of an inner\r\nheap. The fountains in the pond changed to conelets with their own\r\ncraterlets. These, after a month, developed gas explosions, flinging up\r\nlava shreds to 800 feet and sometimes higher than the edge of the pit.\r\n\r\nThis started a slumping of the exploding cones. The explosions were\r\na symptom of increasing viscosity of lava under the bottom heap, and\r\nthe viscosity was revealed in stiff lava welling up around the edges\r\nof the floor. This filled up the wall valley, and so compensated the\r\nslump that the bottom became level. Then the activity ceased. It all\r\ndemonstrated how an inner dome in Halemaumau could become filled with\r\nan intrusive lens, which by welling out around the edges, could restore\r\nthe dome to horizontality. It was like the “laccoliths” of the Black\r\nHills. After the 1934 eruption, Kilauea simply went out of business for\r\neighteen years. Halemaumau lava returned in 1952.\r\n\r\nMauna Loa activity was renewed meanwhile, with summit crater inflows in\r\n1933 and with intense seismic activity under the northeast rift. Depths\r\nof seismic centers were at first seventeen miles down, and thereafter\r\nfive miles down, as reported by seismologist Hugh Waesche. He worked\r\nwith the formulae of distance, direction, and depth established\r\nby Austin Jones, using preliminary tremor, comparative excursions\r\nof lines, and a model of the island. These had become precise by\r\nmathematical triangulation of the island of Hawaii, with seismograph\r\nrecords from Kilauea, Hilo, and Kona stations. The distance from each\r\nstation was interpreted from the duration of the preliminary tremor;\r\nand the meeting point of the several distances within the island model\r\nlocated the seismic focus inside Mauna Loa Mountain where the lava was\r\nsplitting it open. The epicenter, or point over the focus, when the\r\nlava in Mauna Loa’s summit crater was stiffening, lay on the northeast\r\nrift in 1933. Therefore the eruption was expected at an old cone,\r\nwhence had come the first outbreak of 1843. This came to pass in 1935.\r\n\r\nE. G. Wingate, who had become superintendent of Hawaii National Park,\r\nagreed with my dictum, made on the basis of seismograms and history,\r\nthat the next outflow would come at the north within two years and\r\nwould endanger Hilo. This I discussed at a public meeting of the Hilo\r\nChamber of Commerce in January 1934, and the report was published under\r\nthe title “The coming lava flow.” The prediction was fulfilled in\r\nDecember 1935, when the flow came as it had in 1843. The eruption broke\r\nout on top and traveled down to Humuula, the saddle between Mauna\r\nLoa and Mauna Kea, then pooled in the saddle and turned toward Hilo.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _25. Jaggar in office of Observatory in “Tin\r\n  House,” 1937_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _26. Bomb bursting on lava flow, December 27,\r\n  1935. Photo by Eleventh Photo Section, A.C., Wheeler Field,\r\n  T.H._]\r\n\r\nThe 1843 flow had reached the saddle and turned toward Kona, and the\r\nsolid remnant of that lava bank deflected the 1935 puddle to the east.\r\nIt was traveling toward Hilo at the rate of a mile a day. This was\r\nthe signal to try stopping it by bombing from airplanes, a procedure\r\nwhich had been proposed from experience with flows in tunnels of their\r\nown crust, where a person on the Kilauea floor could look through a\r\ncaved-in hole in the roof and see the glowing river inside. Thurston\r\nand I had discussed blasting such a roof to cool off the lava and pile\r\nit up, thus forcing it to a new outlet and stopping the frontal flow.\r\nIt was Guido Giacometti of Olaa who suggested bombing rather than\r\ndynamiting. I called on the Army Air Force, and a conference was held\r\nin Hilo. With Colonel Delos C. Emmons, Wing Commander, I flew over\r\nthe source tunnel. This was at 9,000 feet on the north side of Mauna\r\nLoa, where a gleaming silvery ribbon of pahoehoe emerged from a hole\r\nin the north slope. This was a crusted lava river, and the fliers were\r\ninstructed to smash it with 600-pound demolition bombs of TNT.\r\n\r\nThe forenoon of December 27 was fixed for the bombing; and by\r\ninvitation of Herbert Shipman, Mrs. Jaggar and I went to Puu Oo Ranch\r\non Mauna Kea to watch what happened. The day was clear, and I saw one\r\nexplosion send up a column of incandescent liquid lava hundreds of feet\r\nhigh, looking like a geyser of blood. In the foreground was the front\r\nof the flow, which we watched as it moved toward Hilo. At the same\r\ntime we were receiving reports from cowboys on its rapidly diminishing\r\nspeed. For about a week the liquid lava remaining in the tunnels kept\r\nspilling forward, and then it stopped. The front was in the headwaters\r\nof the Wailuku River, Hilo’s water supply.\r\n\r\nWe afterwards visited the bomb craters in the source region, to find\r\nthat there had been numerous hits on the lava tunnel and that the\r\ncooling off had solidified the source lava back into the mountain\r\nrift. The remainder of the eruption expended itself with internal\r\nfountaining in the summit wells at the top end of the flank rift. From\r\nthe coincidence of the times of bombing and the slowing down of frontal\r\nflow, there appeared no question that the smashing of the source tunnel\r\nwas effective and had saved Hilo. We had not anticipated that active\r\nfountaining would be forced back to the summit well from the 9,000-foot\r\ncraterlet, but summit smoke continuing for two months verified that\r\nthis had happened. This showed the physical chemistry of bubbling slag\r\nto be in delicate adjustment and a lava eruption once started to be\r\nmore sensitive to shock than anyone had dreamed. This conclusion was\r\nreconfirmed by the bombing of the 1942 flow.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, changes in Observatory personnel led to new\r\nresearches. Wingate, who succeeded Wilson as engineer, set up\r\ntriangulation monuments in Puna to test further motion on the Kapoho\r\nrift of 1924. He also devised and set up three tilt instruments in\r\nthree cellars which were blasted out of the lava around Halemaumau\r\npit. Howard Powers came from Harvard as petrologist and collected and\r\nmapped many rock specimens in Kona, on Hualalai, and in Olaa. He also\r\nmade curves of the tilt records for the first twenty years of the\r\nObservatory. Hugh Waesche was transferred from the Park Service to the\r\nposition of geologist at the Observatory. A skilled radio amateur, he\r\ntook over seismological work. In 1938 he dealt with an important group\r\nof earthquakes along the Chain of Craters east of Kilauea. These were\r\naccompanied by faulting, which made cracks, chasms, and humps in the\r\nroad, and some new hot places. This indicated a reaction underground,\r\nback toward Halemaumau from the submarine outflow of April 1924.\r\n\r\nFinch from his headquarters at Lassen reported regularly in the\r\n_Volcano Letter_, on hot spring temperatures and earthquakes.\r\nHe conducted two expeditions to Alaska, inspecting the seismographs\r\nand making volcano explorations and maps on Akutan Island. Another\r\nexpedition was to Shishaldin Volcano, at the west end of the big\r\nAleutian island of Unimak during one of its eruptive spells.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time and earlier H. T. Stearns represented the\r\nGeological Survey and the Territory of Hawaii in publications on\r\ngeology and water supply on all the islands. The island of Hawaii was\r\nmade the subject of a splendid geological map in color by Stearns and\r\nGordon Macdonald, petrographer, with a book on the geological history\r\nof Hawaii, profusely illustrated with photographs and diagrams. Their\r\nbook is practically a modern textbook on the geology of active lava\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nRichmond Hodges, sent by the Geological Survey from Washington, was\r\ntrained in the technique of government filing and relieved me of work\r\nwith correspondence and routine. He also took over the editing of the\r\n_Volcano Letter_ and assisted Mr. Wilson with the writing of\r\narticles when I was away in Alaska. My secretaries after Hodges were\r\nRuth Baker and Sutejiro Sato, and Miss Baker’s work extended into the\r\n1940’s.\r\n\r\nTilt studies made at the three cellars around the rim of Halemaumau\r\ndid not produce the anticipated results, but they answered our\r\nquestions. The three cellars were placed at 120 degrees to each other,\r\nwith reference to a meridian crossing the pit, one at the north, one\r\neast-southeast and one west-southwest.\r\n\r\nIt was thought, when these tiltoscopes were set up, that the Kilauea\r\nfloor would swell or shrink as an inner dome, with the pit at its\r\ncenter. But nothing of the kind was revealed. The tilting was found to\r\nbe more or less at right angles to the long western wall of Kilauea\r\nCrater, itself an extension from the southwestern rift of Kilauea\r\nMountain. The rift extends under Halemaumau pit, as was proved in\r\n1920, when the Kau Desert outflows from the rift cracks kept pace\r\nwith the lowering of Halemaumau lava. This means that the ring of\r\nHalemaumau’s rock wall is in two pieces, divided by the rift dikes\r\ntrending northeast-southwest, and that the tilting over upward pressure\r\nfrom below is not radial but is northwest and southeast. Wilson’s\r\nleveling results that showed the whole mountain swelling up were based\r\non isolated benchmarks relative to sea level, and this swelling was\r\nprobably unsymmetrical, just as the southwest rift and the eastern rift\r\nof the Chain of Craters make a bend in plan and are unsymmetrical. The\r\nmountain is not a uniform elliptical dome.\r\n\r\nI have said that the decade of the 1930’s was a time of culmination\r\nfor Kilauea. It was also a period of financial depression and stress\r\nfor all of us. The Volcano House burned down, the new hotel was placed\r\non the Observatory site, and the Observatory administration barely\r\nsurvived. The Hawaiian Volcano Research Association did much to keep\r\nthe Observatory alive, but one year we all went on half pay. By dint\r\nof this half-pay episode and because everybody insisted that volcano\r\nrecords must not be permitted to lapse, the Secretary of the Interior\r\ntransferred the Observatory in 1935 to the better financed National\r\nPark Service.\r\n\r\nWith Wingate as superintendent of Hawaii National Park, we were assured\r\nof loyal support and were able to combine scientific aims with National\r\nPark activities. Thus, the Volcano Observatory regained its status.\r\nWe were also assisted by the publication of the economic success of\r\nthe Mauna Loa bombing, in face of the threat to Hilo which involved\r\nsome 51 million dollars of buildings and harbor. This threat Wingate\r\nand I studied carefully in the light of history, and we succeeded in\r\ngetting $10,000 from Congress for an investigation by U.S. Engineers\r\nof the possibility of a construction to protect Hilo from a disastrous\r\nlava flow. Colonel Bermel appointed civil engineer Belcher to Hilo,\r\nand Belcher worked for a year in 1938 on my design of a lava diversion\r\nchannel and earthworks, to extend for seven miles from the Wailuku\r\nRiver gorge above Hilo to the airport.\r\n\r\nThis was to take care of another such lava flow as that of 1881 by\r\ndeflecting it with the natural valleys southward from the congested\r\ndistrict. A critical design was made of the channel, the height of the\r\nobstruction, and the openings needed for waterways and public roads.\r\nThe plan was not to block the passage of lava, but merely to deflect it\r\nby means of an artificial barrier to channel it downhill. This would\r\nsend it along the natural grades, diagonally forcing a lava stream away\r\nfrom the business district, the harbor, the factories, and the airport.\r\n\r\nThe design was approved by a reviewing board in Washington as effective\r\nfor the purpose intended. However, with this project went a redesign\r\nof Hilo breakwater and a plan for dredging the harbor which took into\r\nconsideration the possibility of a severe tidal wave. Unfortunately the\r\nappropriation estimate was considered too large and was turned down in\r\nWashington. When the great tidal wave came in 1946 it proved that such\r\nan extended breakwater attached to the northern shore of Hilo harbor\r\nwould have lessened the terrible destruction and loss of life.\r\n\r\nA diversion in the lives of Mrs. Jaggar and myself was an invitation in\r\n1936 from the Royal Society of London, to go to Montserrat in the West\r\nIndies where for three years they had been having bad earthquakes. Sir\r\nGerald Lenox-Conyngham, whom we had met at the Japan congress, wrote\r\nme asking for my help because Montserrat’s dormant hot volcano was\r\nmaking excessive hydrogen sulfide gas at its two solfataras. The smell\r\nsickened and alarmed the inhabitants of the port of Plymouth, and the\r\ngas was blackening the paint of white steamships. The earthquakes had\r\ncome in spasms culminating in big damage to masonry from 1934 onward.\r\nPerret had flown over from Martinique and tried to help by applying\r\nsound theories to prediction of seasonal tidal controls of the volcano,\r\nbut he was scoffed at as a voodoo soothsayer by a British Navy captain.\r\nThe scientific commission appointed was Dr. C. F. Powell of Bristol,\r\nnow Nobel Prize physicist, and Dr. A. G. MacGregor of the Geological\r\nSurvey, besides Dr. Lenox-Conyngham, formerly Director of the Geodetic\r\nSurvey of India. Dr. Powell used adaptations of my shock recorder, both\r\nhorizontal and vertical, built by the Kew Observatory. Designs had been\r\nobtained from instruments I sent to Dr. Marsden in New Zealand, after\r\nthe Napier earthquake.\r\n\r\nWhen I received the invitation to go to Montserrat, I packed up such\r\ninstruments as I could find, and telephoned Mrs. Jaggar in Honolulu\r\nto be ready to go with me to Los Angeles the following Saturday. She\r\nwas always ready to act as secretary on a new adventure, and with much\r\nbustle and scramble we packed her things. Later I joined her at the\r\nsteamer, a Danish freighter which was to take us through the Canal to\r\nthe Caribbean. Boarding as we did on such short notice, we were given\r\na steward’s room in the bowels of the ship; but we had the run of the\r\nfirst cabin. It was a delightful trip through Panama and Jamaica, both\r\nof which I was happy to see again, twenty-six years after my 1910\r\nexperience with the canal engineers. Great changes had been wrought,\r\nand it was a thrill to see the ship pulled through step-up after\r\nstep-up of canal locks, by the “iron mules” of that marvelous machinery.\r\n\r\nWe left the delightful freighter people at Charlotte Amalie in the\r\nVirgin Islands where we stayed at Blue Beard’s Castle. After a wait of\r\nsome days, we got a small Dutch island freighter to go to Montserrat.\r\nWe stopped at St. Martin, an astonishing place, French at one end\r\nand Dutch at the other, with practically no custom house to mark the\r\nboundary, though the wines and the language changed in the middle of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nSaba is a startling extinct volcano rising as a steep rocky cone\r\ndirectly from the water, with no harbor but a stop opposite a gully\r\nthat leads up to the crater. After landing in small boats, we climbed\r\nup the gulch to the settlement, a picturesque place, with masonry\r\nhouses and many flowers, where the government is Dutch but all talk\r\nEnglish, and its history goes back to the buccaneers. The village is on\r\na flat in the lowest part of a cup crater, the top of our climb, but\r\nthe name of the settlement is The Bottoms.\r\n\r\nOur little ship joined the main line of the leeward volcanoes at\r\nSt. Kitts, where we made connections for Antigua and Montserrat.\r\nIn Montserrat we stayed with Miss Gillie at the Rainbow House and\r\njoined the Englishman Powell and the Scot MacGregor. I met Perret at\r\nAntigua, and we compared notes on the similarity of the earthquakes\r\nand the rotten-egg smell (sulfuretted hydrogen) at Montserrat to the\r\neruptions of Pelée in Martinique, where these phenomena were followed\r\nby explosions and lava. The Montserrat authorities justly feared what\r\nwas coming.\r\n\r\nPerret had for two years kept track of events at Montserrat in relation\r\nto equinox and solstice. He had built a hut there at the dangerous\r\nsolfatara near town, had made an instrument shelter with a thermograph,\r\nand on a pedestal close to a nearby residence had set up an ingenious\r\nearthquake accumulator, which had recorded at the end of twenty-four\r\nhours the total expenditure of seismic energy in each direction. As\r\nthere were hundreds of strong shocks, the instruments recorded total\r\nseismic energy per day and its dominant direction.\r\n\r\nI found that Powell had set up my shock recorders among volunteers on\r\nthe island, and a seismograph at the agricultural station. A new form\r\nof the Jaggar shock recorder had the weight attached to horizontal flat\r\nsprings so as to oscillate up and down. I was especially pleased with\r\nthe earthquake records kept by a Mr. English living in the countryside.\r\nAssisted by his wife, he had carefully listed the times and intensities\r\nof hundreds of shocks, with notes on important events.\r\n\r\nMuch help was furnished by the Agricultural Experiment Station, which\r\nprovided an assistant to take us to many geologic places and to the\r\nsecond solfatara, consisting of hot springs and sulfur in a southern\r\nvalley of the volcano. The volcano of Montserrat is at the south end of\r\nthe island, while the northern part consists of older hills. The summit\r\ncrater is a remote and inaccessible forested area among peaks. The\r\nvolcano is much like Pelée in size and appearance.\r\n\r\nWe were allowed to take a steamer to St. Vincent and Barbados, stopping\r\nat Dominica. There the Governor kindly entertained us for a few hours,\r\nsending the government launch and driving us up the valley on a fête\r\nday when the negro women were all in picturesque costume. We saw\r\nhis summer place with lovely gardens. We had tea with his wife, and\r\nI discussed with him the earthquake problem. On the drive we saw a\r\nremarkable cliff of hexagonal columns, some of them curved like a fan,\r\nrepresenting the old lavas of Dominica.\r\n\r\nThe administrative problems of the British islands involved not only\r\nhurricanes and earthquakes, but tactful handling of the dominant negro,\r\nCarib Indian, and mulatto population, which is very ticklish, for there\r\nhave been riots and labor troubles. I was astonished in several of\r\nthe islands to learn that distinguished Englishmen in government and\r\nplanter classes were partly colored. In the society club of Montserrat\r\nwe met a leading lawyer who was coal black, and we saw London-educated\r\nnegroes dancing with English girls. We found the same customs in St.\r\nVincent, and to a much lesser extent, in Barbados.\r\n\r\nIn St. Vincent Mr. Abbot, MacDonald’s secretary, took us to see my\r\nold friend T. M. MacDonald the planter, at Chateau Belair on the west\r\nside of Soufrière, where Hovey, Curtis, and I had climbed in 1902. We\r\ntraveled up the west coast by automobile, and saw one of the primitive\r\nsugar mills, where the juice is boiled down to a syrup to be shipped\r\nto lumber mills in Canada. Nothing could be in greater contrast to\r\nthe modern sugar factories in Hawaii, and the negro labor gives the\r\nindustry an entirely different aspect. To get to Chateau Belair we had\r\nto motor up a canyon far into the interior, around hairpin turns over\r\nvertical cliffs and along a narrow ridge, and then return to shore\r\non the other side of the valley. We rode along the beach under the\r\nvolcano, and saw the rehabilitated Richmond plantation, with the west\r\nflank of Soufrière Volcano under heavy clouds. Owing to torrents of\r\nrain, we had to make part of the return to Kingstown in a rowboat.\r\n\r\nLater we drove over an excellent road up the east shore to Georgetown,\r\nand beyond that on the foot of the volcano slope, where a group of\r\nplantations had been purchased after the eruption of 1902 by Mr.\r\nBarnard, who with his charming wife, entertained us. Hundreds of acres\r\nof coconut trees, arrowroot, and sugar cane had replaced the utter\r\ndevastation of 1902. Barnard showed us a modern still for making rum\r\nfrom sugar cane, and I was astonished to see that the product is just\r\nas clear as alcohol, the rum color being artificial. We rode horseback\r\nmost of the way to the crater of Soufrière, over a trail through\r\nforests and across streams, very different from hiking in horrible\r\ndesolation and fog up bare ridges covered with volcanic bombs, such as\r\nHovey and Curtis and I had encountered on this same slope at the time\r\nof the eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe trail still followed knife-edge divides with perilous slopes on\r\nboth sides of the path, but now concealed with mountain growth. We rode\r\nnearly to the edge of the crater, now a very different picture, with\r\na large lake only a few hundred feet below, as it had been before the\r\neruption of 1902. Two sturdy native women coming from Chateau Belair\r\nappeared with baskets of fruit on their heads, tramping a 3,000 foot\r\nheight to deliver their goods to Georgetown on the east side of the\r\nisland. This is an old story for these straight-backed natives, and\r\nthese treks across mountains were equally characteristic of the creoles\r\nin Martinique and the northern islands. These people would spend the\r\nnight near their market on the opposite side of the islands.\r\n\r\nIn Kingstown we were shown the elaborate process by which arrowroot is\r\nmade into edible starch, the powdery product being critically graded by\r\ndelicate shades of color. This corm, which makes inconspicuous fields\r\nof low growing pointed _Canna_ leaves and small white flowers, is\r\nquite different from the cassava, or manioc, which I had known on my\r\nfirst visits to the West Indies. Arrowroot has been developed by the\r\nagricultural experiment stations of the British, who for many years\r\nsearched for a new commercial product. The St. Vincent arrowroot is\r\nnow a major industry which has spread to the other islands and is\r\ncultivated by small planters.\r\n\r\nIn the volcano islands I interviewed government people to call\r\nattention to the crisis in Montserrat, using it as an illustration\r\nof the need at the numerous vents for the development of observatory\r\nmethods, particularly in geology, chemistry, oceanography, and\r\nseismology, including measurements of ground surface movements and\r\ntilt. I had recommended this for Martinique and St. Vincent in 1902;\r\nand Perret, with some support by the French government, had gone to\r\nlive in St. Pierre and make a museum, stimulated by the Pelée outbreak\r\nof 1929. So far as geophysics is concerned, the governments of St.\r\nVincent and Jamaica have gone to sleep since the volcano disaster of\r\n1902 and the earthquake building reforms of 1907. It is discouraging\r\nto a scientist to know that the science of economic geophysics and\r\ngeography in such a magnificent field as the West Indian volcanoes has\r\nto be awakened by such disasters as were now occurring in Montserrat,\r\nwith no forecasting at all. The whole Montserrat episode was like our\r\nunforeseen Hualalai earthquakes of 1929, and in both places my shock\r\nrecorder was called in to help.\r\n\r\nWe went on to Barbados, a flat non-seismic land, where in 1902 I had\r\ninterviewed the _Roraima_ victims. We returned by way of St.\r\nLucia, where we drove to the solfatara, which as usual is in a valley\r\nwith sulfur and hot springs, near sea level, and not in a crater.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Montserrat, where the earthquakes and bad gases\r\nhad died down after 1936. The investigations of the Commission\r\n(Lenox-Conyngham made his visit after I left), came to publication in\r\nPowell and MacGregor’s reports on the seismic analysis and the geology.\r\nI sent in a report with photographs and charts on the whole chain of\r\nvolcanoes, in relation to the Montserrat crisis, by comparison with\r\nother volcanoes. Lenox-Conyngham wrote an article for _Nature_.\r\nMacGregor later published a critical analysis of modern data on the\r\nprobabilities of eruption in all of the West Indian volcanoes. Perret\r\npublished a large monograph on Montserrat, illustrated with his\r\nbeautiful photographs.\r\n\r\nWe passed Martinique by sea, and I saw the huge pile of lava the 1929\r\neruption had added, to make an entirely new summit to Mount Pelée.\r\nVegetation and habitation had reappeared at St. Pierre, but the\r\nmountain was bare.\r\n\r\nWe returned to Hawaii by way of Bermuda, Boston, and Washington, where\r\nthe temperature was hotter than we had felt in the tropics. Reviewing\r\nthe journey, I was encouraged to perceive that geology had changed a\r\ngreat deal since the struggle that Hovey and I, after our experience at\r\nMount Pelée, had had to make geological societies realize that changes\r\nin the field must be constantly measured. The real obstacles to getting\r\nfield measurements permanently manned as pure science are lack of money\r\nand the fashions of education. Perret and I have been two isolated\r\nenthusiasts crying in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nAny young scientist with photographic skill who will give his life\r\nto living with and reporting upon a single volcano group can make a\r\ngreat contribution to science. He must have suitable financial backers\r\nand a publication agency and instruments not dependent upon frequent\r\neruptions. What volcano science needs most is permanent dwellers, using\r\nall the resources of sensitive geophysics and chemistry and dwelling\r\nclose to craters or solfataras. Such lands as the Taupo District of\r\nNew Zealand are ideal, but not when observed at a distance. Wairaki is\r\nnow under investigation for commercial power. Hilo is being critically\r\nexamined for a lava diversion scheme. But these projects are not what\r\nI mean, and are not pure science. The personal devotion of a lifetime,\r\nas in the cases of Pasteur or Schweitzer, is what produces the emergent\r\nevolution of true science.\r\n\r\nI have called this chapter Prophecy and Hope because of six fruitful\r\nprognostications and hope for the future of volcanology. Of the\r\nprognostications, one was the threat to Hilo which came true in 1934.\r\nTwo, the forecast to the effect that bombing would stop a lava flow\r\ncame true. Three, the belief that a volcano observatory would be\r\nproductive of instruments came true. Four, the prediction of danger\r\nto Hilo produced definite defensive plans by U.S. Engineers. Five,\r\npredictions of time and place of Mauna Loa outbreaks, seismically and\r\nhistorically proved practical. Six, the prediction of Kilauea sinking\r\nlava, based on sinking at Mauna Loa, had repeatedly been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhen my government service as Volcanologist ended in 1940 and R. H.\r\nFinch had been appointed my successor, substantial recognition of\r\nthe Observatory had come from Washington, New Zealand, and Great\r\nBritain. Great help had come from Presidents Arthur L. Dean and\r\nDavid L. Crawford of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, and new\r\nassistance came from President Gregg M. Sinclair. This was to lead to\r\nmy employment by the University as Research Associate in 1940. Thus\r\nI was to continue, during the next decade, the publishing of Volcano\r\nObservatory results.\r\n\r\nOver and over again Hawaiian volcanology demonstrated the need of\r\nadvertisement, occasionally reaching such men as Everett Morss, M.I.T.\r\ntrustee in Boston; Lorin Thurston, business leader in Honolulu;\r\nHenderson, Washington financier, for our borings; and Cramton, leader\r\nof Congress. The Volcano Research Association in Honolulu is a devoted\r\ngroup of businessmen keeping up a small fund of $6,000 per annum,\r\ntrivial compared to the big laboratories of commerce and astronomy. A\r\npure science of volcanology, with world-wide laboratories is now needed\r\nto catch the eye and ear of imaginative men of business. Friedlaender\r\nin Naples, Perret on Mount Pelée, and Omori in Tokyo almost created\r\nenough imaginative stimulus to real exploration of volcanoes and of the\r\ninner earth. They were battered down by natural catastrophe and by wars.\r\n\r\nThe 1940’s were enriched by three good friends Vern Hinkley, Stanley\r\nPorteus, and Frank Rieber; respectively journalist, psychologist, and\r\nphysicist-inventor. They all took a keen interest in my writing and\r\nmechanical inventions, and Hinkley assisted in the Observatory work\r\nduring the explosive eruption and wrote “that was the top experience of\r\nmy newspaper career.”\r\n\r\nHinkley, who had edited the _Hilo Tribune Herald_, became managing\r\neditor of the _Honolulu Star-Bulletin_ and published a series\r\nof my radio addresses on Kilauea. He also sent his photographer to\r\nphotograph our laboratories, thereby keeping the public informed about\r\nvolcano study. And he worked up a history of my navy monographs and\r\nhardness testing instruments. He was a lovable fellow whose publicity\r\ninstinct was a great asset to volcano science. He did not think of a\r\nvolcano as something sensational, but remained moderate about it and\r\ninformed his public accurately. Through him, the Volcano Observatory\r\nreports came to be accepted as desirable routine, and he was elected\r\na director of the Volcano Research Association. His many friends were\r\ndesolated by his early and sudden death.\r\n\r\nPorteus is an Australian man of science who conducted expeditions\r\namong the Australian blacks and the primitive Africans of Kalihari and\r\nspecialized in the mental outlook of primitive peoples. He devised a\r\nfamous maze for intelligence tests. He has published numerous books\r\nabout Hawaii and several novels, including “Restless voyage,” the life\r\nof Archibald Campbell, who lived with Kamehameha the great and survived\r\namputation of both legs.\r\n\r\nWith Guido Giacometti, who suggested airplane bombing of the volcano\r\nlava flows, Porteus and I foregathered at the crater frequently to\r\ndiscuss the constitution of earth interior. Porteus differed with\r\nmy belief on the evolution of mind as a mutation of evolution. Like\r\nHinkley he became a member of the Board of Directors of our Research\r\nAssociation. He is a judge of the juvenile court, skilled in curing\r\ndelinquency. Porteus is a world thinker, who agrees with me in thinking\r\nof altruism as a form of energy. Porteus invented the title of this\r\npresent book.\r\n\r\nRieber started from the University of California where he became\r\ninterested in making an echo from underground strata to locate oil. He\r\nmoved to Los Angeles, where his father was a professor of classical\r\nlanguages and a college dean. Frank invented a complex recording\r\nseismograph carried on a motor truck, wherewith he set off explosive\r\nbombs and registered echo earthquakes from every important underground\r\nlayer. These layers identified oil-bearing strata, so that the marks\r\non a revolving drum practically mapped a section underground for\r\na guide to oil drilling. He moved to New York and established war\r\ninventions, among them phonograph disks for repeating whole conferences\r\nof many talkers. He founded Geovision Ltd., a company which greatly\r\nabbreviated the scanning of echoes for subterranean mapping. Then he\r\ndied suddenly, like Hinkley, in the full flower of a brilliant mind.\r\nRieber and I corresponded for years on invention gadgets, comparing\r\nnotes by letters, and meeting all too rarely. To me he was one of\r\nour most productive physicists, always inspiring. He was convinced\r\nthat discovery of petroleum will endlessly increase and will become\r\nautomatic. He and I looked downward into the shell of the globe.\r\n\r\nThis decade I devoted primarily to writing and publication, some of\r\nthe writing voluminous and still unpublished. In 1941 I moved into an\r\noffice in Hawaii Hall of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. My paper\r\nwork consisted primarily in completing, revising, and illustrating a\r\nmemoir on “Origin and development of craters,” in cooperation with the\r\nGeological Society of America. The censor chosen by the Society was Dr.\r\nHowel Williams of the University of California, who cordially endorsed\r\nthe book.\r\n\r\nThe Society subscribed $350 from its Penrose Fund to assist with\r\ndrafting and clerical work on the substantial results of our\r\nobservations of Hawaiian craters in the twentieth century. The\r\ngroundwork had long been laid, for beginning under Alexander Agassiz at\r\nthe Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge and during my visit to\r\nVesuvius in 1906, I planned a book on volcanology. Later, in 1910 after\r\ncareful study of the work of Dana, Hitchcock, and Brigham on Hawaiian\r\nvolcanoes, I started analysis of Kilauea Volcano in the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Thus this one large volume with photogravures, maps, and\r\ndiagrams covers the history of observations and conclusions from\r\nHawaiian Volcano Observatory work for thirty years.\r\n\r\nMy thesis is that there must be some order in time and space for what\r\nis obviously 1,700 miles of submarine volcanic upbuilding in the\r\nHawaiian chain. Active volcanoes are hot and erupting in Hawaii; sunken\r\nones are covered with coral at Midway Island; and intermediate ones,\r\nhalf coral and half lava, are in the middle of the chain. Disregarding\r\nthe ocean water, all of these are gigantic mountains below sea level.\r\nOn the island of Hawaii I found symmetry, which I called “The cross of\r\nHawaii” in an address to the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce in 1912. I\r\nnoted that Mauna Kea forms the top of a cross on the map; the upright\r\nextends along the southwest rift of Mauna Loa, and two symmetrical\r\ncurved arms extend to Hualalai summit and Kilauea summit. The lava\r\nflows from Mauna Loa north and south arrange themselves symmetrically\r\nabout this design, with every evidence that Mauna Loa dome was piled\r\nup in a spoon underlaid by Hualalai, Mauna Kea, and Kilauea. It is\r\nobvious on the map that Mauna Loa upbuilding was obstructed by grandpa\r\nMauna Kea and that it has been forced off to the southwest by the two\r\ndaughters, to build the elongate point of the island. Kilauea is old on\r\nthe Haleakala, Kohala, Kea line; and Hualalai is old on a right angle\r\nline at Kea.\r\n\r\nFrom my training in physiography under W. M. Davis of Harvard, I was\r\nconvinced when I first saw Hawaii and studied the books about it that\r\ndownward faulting toward the sea bottom, of sliding island blocks, is\r\nconspicuous. It shows in the V-shaped fracture of Haleakala Crater,\r\na broken sector, and in the straight fracture of the north half of\r\nMolokai volcano, leaving the mighty cliffs there. It shows in the\r\neastern half of Kohala volcano leaving the fault facets and hanging\r\nvalleys of Waimanu, and in the Mohokea embayment of the southeast\r\nend of Mauna Loa. The embayment shows evidence of the breakdown of\r\nan ancient crater as described by Hitchcock. Moreover, Kilauea, Wood\r\nValley, Mohokea, and Waiohinu amphitheater are four old calderas of\r\nfaulting in a line. This seemed to me confirmed by the down-faulted\r\nsteps of the southeast side of Kilauea Mountain, and the observed\r\ndown-breaking there of the shoreline during earthquakes. This, in 1868,\r\ndrowned coconut trees below the sea and caused big earthquakes on a\r\nsubmerged fault in 1868 and 1952.\r\n\r\nSuch action was further confirmed by our experience of a down-faulted\r\nblock during earthquakes at Kapoho in April 1924, before Halemaumau\r\nexploded, confirming the view that the active volcanoes break downward\r\nin slices along shorelines, even when they swell upward around craters.\r\nHarold Stearns always combatted the idea of faulting and made Mohokea,\r\nHaleakala, and Waipio erosion forms; but this I cannot accept.\r\n\r\nThe logic to the effect that in the long and large the old volcanoes\r\nfrom Hawaii to Midway have been on slices of the earth’s crust faulted\r\ndownward below sea level through the ages seems incontrovertible. The\r\nfault planes are diagonals across the main volcanic rift trend and make\r\nthe channels between the islands at an angle in plan to the trend of\r\nthe island chain. These channels are very deep. All of this philosophy\r\ndeveloped in my mind before I came to Hawaii.\r\n\r\nAlso I thought that the origin of life might have been from volcanic\r\ngas, owing to the prominence of carbon dioxide, water vapor, hydrogen,\r\nsulfur, and nitrogen, all ingredients of both protein and volcanoes.\r\nI put this up to R. T. Jackson, who taught me phylogeny when I was\r\nstudying fossils and he was studying genetics. Knowing the sulfurous\r\nquality of an egg yolk, I asked him if it wasn’t possible that as\r\nevolution goes back behind the embryo, we should find volcanic traces\r\nchemically. Phylogeny means that the history of the embryo reenacts the\r\nhistory of the race, and I merely extended this back to the inorganic.\r\nI was laughed at for carrying biological origin back to gases of\r\nvolcanoes; but Shepherd and I collected gases from flaming Kilauea\r\nlava, and found the five elemental constituents: carbon, oxygen,\r\nnitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur. These also make up the aminoacids\r\nof protein, so my philosophy of origin still seemed to me to be\r\nreasonable. Volcanoes erupted through the ocean, and life came out of\r\nthe unexplored deeps of the sea.\r\n\r\nThus in 1910 I began a book on craters which came to fruition in a\r\nMemoir of the Geological Society. This was not published until 1947,\r\nbut I was working on it, drawing the diagrams, dictating the typescript\r\nto Sato, and selecting for illustration the best of our photographs\r\nduring the thirties.\r\n\r\nOne of the diagrams shows eleven-year cycles, beginning with 1790\r\nand ending with 1935. I adopted this after finding in Hitchcock a\r\ntabulation for Halemaumau, indicating big lowerings of lava in 1790,\r\n1823, 1855, and 1891, to which we added 1924 from our own experience.\r\nThese were approximately thirty-three years apart, as I found when I\r\nplotted the data on a curve of Hitchcock’s table. Taking other major\r\nsinkings as punctuation points--such as the outflows and collapse\r\nof Halemaumau in 1832, 1840, 1868, and 1931--there developed a\r\ncorrespondence in the subsidence times treated as repose periods, with\r\nthe years having the least numbers of sunspots at average intervals of\r\n11.1 years. The intervening times of maxima of sunspots all occurred in\r\nthe intermediate times of rising lava.\r\n\r\nThe curve as a whole from 1823 to 1924 shows a notable crest from\r\n1855 to 1890, and a crest of the greatest volume of Mauna Loa gushing\r\noccurred between 1855 and 1877. Stearns and Macdonald object to this\r\ndiagram as not showing all the little intermediate events, but what I\r\nhave taken are the actual peaks and depressions above sea level and\r\nthose which correspond to the sunspot interval of 11.1 years. This is\r\nan average even for sunspots, which had long intervals at the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century, a time when no reports were made for Kilauea.\r\n\r\nI have guessed a drop of Kilauea lava as dating from about A. D. 1800,\r\ncorresponding to the notable expulsion of Mauna Loa lava through\r\nHualalai, and an imaginary unreported lowering eleven years thereafter,\r\nas it is improbable the island was wholly dead in the first twenty\r\nyears of the century. The explosive eruptions of 1790 certainly\r\nproduced a big collapse at Kilauea.\r\n\r\nMy faith in this diagram is based on the fact that our own eruption\r\nsinkings at eleven year intervals (1902, 1913, 1924, and 1935) agree\r\nso well with an eleven-year theory that we are justified in looking\r\nbackward for eleven year averages. Perret has found intervals of about\r\na decade for Vesuvius. All my experience of Hawaiian lava leads to the\r\nbelief, shown by our lava tides and several short-term diagrams, that\r\nrhythmic periods of a volcanic system are related to gravitational\r\ncontrol of the sun and moon. There are rhythmic controls of the globe\r\nby the gravitational control of the sun and moon. There are rhythmic\r\ncontrols of the globe by the sun, and rhythmic controls of very deep\r\nvolcanic cracks by the globe, and rhythmic controls of individual\r\ngroups of volcanoes by the long volcanic chains over cracks. Our\r\nexperimental data are limited by the little groups of volcanoes, and so\r\nthe big rhythmic movements seem inaccessible to science, mostly because\r\nwe have no record of relationships of single volcanoes 500 miles apart\r\nin such a place as Alaska.\r\n\r\nWe raise no question about night and day or about the oceanic tides or\r\nabout the moon’s phases. We know there is a rock tide in the earth,\r\nthat there is a hot earth core of about 2200° Centigrade which appears\r\nto seismology to be a very massive liquid 1,800 miles down. Gravitation\r\nis the controlling force of the solar system, the galaxy and the\r\nuniverse, and it works by rhythms, from the orbits of the planets in\r\nyears, to the outermost spiral nebulae in millions of centuries. We\r\nare ourselves controlled by it in locomotion and in the circulation of\r\nthe blood. Therefore to think of volcanoes as anything but periodic\r\nand gravitational in their relation to the globe would, to me, make\r\nthe science of volcanoes entirely uninteresting. All science lives on\r\nrhythmic action.\r\n\r\nA second manuscript entitled “Steamblast eruptions,” was based on\r\nMount Pelée in Martinique and a comparison with the 1924 steamblast of\r\nKilauea. This last had conclusively shown outflow under the sea, and\r\ninflow of groundwater, to change lava surging to blasts from a steam\r\nboiler. A paper published in 1940 was a study of the gas collections\r\nfrom flaming basalt on Kilauea and Mauna Loa, made by E. S. Shepherd\r\nand me. In this I plotted curves of relative excellence of collection\r\nin relation to the amount of the volcanic gases, in contrast to the\r\nnon-volcanic aqueous and oceanic gases. These latter, notably water\r\nvapor, decreased in proportion to the manipulative excellence of the\r\nhandling of vacuum tubes; and the volcanic gases increased, notably\r\nhydrogen and the carbon gases. This convinced me that the deep gas of\r\nvolcanoes is hydrogen, associated with carbon dioxide and nitrogen.\r\n\r\nIn this decade, too, war brought new demands on my time and experience\r\nand had its effect on the Kilauea Observatory. Major James Snedeker of\r\nthe Marine Corps, legal officer for the Commanding General in Honolulu,\r\nhaving heard of our experience with motorcar amphibians, told me that\r\nthe Pacific Ocean war would depend on amphibian landing craft. And a\r\nletter from Admiral Bloch urged me to send to the Navy details of our\r\nexperience with amphibians. As this involved geology of beaches around\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, I set to work on twelve monographs for the Navy\r\ndealing with the mechanism of amphibians and the problems they posed on\r\nbeaches in Hawaii, Puget Sound, and Alaska. Other subjects about which\r\nI supplied information were the inflammability of Japanese buildings\r\nin the Tokyo earthquake, the handling of earthquake and volcano\r\ncatastrophes and our material from journals on many places of volcanic\r\ndanger in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThen W. H. Hammond, physicist in charge of a testing laboratory at\r\nPearl Harbor, suggested that I revive my 1897–1908 testing of steel for\r\nabrasion hardness, later continued by Boynton, for his laboratory of\r\nthe Navy. Thus I started hardness testing at the University and carried\r\nit on for ten years. I used diamond and other abrasives in instruments\r\nto show directly on a dial the rate of wear of metals or minerals under\r\nstandardized conditions, with a constant and reproducible motor tool.\r\nAbrasion hardness turned out to be as tricky a problem as my range\r\nfinders and shock recorders. This activity brought together in the\r\nUniversity laboratory and in the laboratory at Hawaii National Park\r\nmany records, manuscripts, and specimens. Ruth Baker, who succeeded\r\nSato as secretary, did valiant work sorting out materials from many\r\nexpeditions which had been dumped in disorder because of war and fire\r\nat the Kilauea Observatory. Though the Park had built a new house for\r\nnaturalists, and for the seismographs, shops, and records, it was\r\ntaken over by the Commanding General on Hawaii, imposing considerable\r\nhardship on Finch and his assistants. One assistant was Burton\r\nLoucks, instrument maker, who married Miss Baker. Another, Austin\r\nJones the seismologist, was transferred to care for seismographs\r\nset up to measure faulting and tilt around Boulder Dam. Dr. Howard\r\nPowers, after work for the Geological Survey and the Territory on the\r\nisland of Maui, joined Jones eventually to enter into a new section\r\nof volcanology, established in Denver under the Geological Survey,\r\nespecially to assist the Army and Navy studies of Aleutian volcanic\r\neruptions, wherefrom harbors and airfields were sometimes endangered.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _27. Fountain in Halemaumau lava lake, May 23,\r\n  1917_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _28. Rare dome fountain during eruption of\r\n  Kilauea Crater, March 20, 1921_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _29. Lava stream issuing from a spatter cone\r\n  near rim of Halemaumau, February 9, 1921_]\r\n\r\nThree events of volcanic and seismic importance to Hawaii during the\r\n1940’s were the eruptions of Mauna Loa in 1940 and 1942 and the 1946\r\ntidal wave caused by a submarine earthquake south of Unalaska. The\r\nwave engulfed the wharves and shorefronts of Hilo and eastern Maui and\r\ncaused considerable damage elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWe were familiar with the recording by our seismographs of earthquake\r\ncenters under the sea of Alaska and Japan, and with the interval of\r\nhours that followed before dangerous water waves reached Hawaiian\r\nshores. We had also had a bad tidal wave in Kona, originating off\r\nJapan; and two or three such waves which damaged Kahului and Hilo had\r\noriginated in big submarine earthquakes off the Alaskan Peninsula. The\r\nJapanese fishermen, from our published warnings, always took their\r\nsampans to deep water, and the Navy had instructed me to let them know\r\nright away if the seismographs recorded a distant earthquake capable of\r\nmaking a tidal wave.\r\n\r\nI earlier had had one unhappy experience with warning the Navy, when\r\nwe registered a seismogram of a big earthquake in Alaska, which if\r\nsubmarine, would send us a tidal wave. I notified Pearl Harbor of the\r\nprobable time of arrival of the wave, should the quake be submarine. It\r\nhappened a big Army and Navy dinner party at Waikiki was set for just\r\nthat time, but orders went out calling officers back to their posts and\r\nthe party was disrupted. No tidal wave came, as the earthquake proved\r\nto be on the mainland of Alaska. The newspapers unmercifully jeered at\r\nme, but the Commanding Admiral told me not to change my policy.\r\n\r\nThe 1946 wave was very large and the water rose in pulsations until it\r\nswept away the railroad bridge and washed out the whole waterfront of\r\nHilo. The earthquake seismogram came at 2 A.M. when no one\r\nwas watching, and the water wave at 8 A.M. came just when the\r\nObservatory workers went on duty. When the flood of ocean destroyed the\r\nHilo breakwater and leaped over it to damage the principal wharves,\r\nmany people were drowned. Considerable damage was done on Oahu and\r\nMaui. The disaster came when Dr. F. P. Shepard, oceanographer of La\r\nJolla, was occupying a summer cottage on the north shore of Oahu; and\r\nhe was delighted to experience a big tidal wave. Collaborating with\r\ngeologists in Hawaii, Shepard compiled a most thorough report on height\r\nof waves in all bays of the Territory. Seismographs and tide gauges got\r\nto work all around the Pacific Ocean, the place on the sea bottom which\r\nhad jolted was exactly located, and the Coast Survey and Navy started\r\nfar-reaching precautions for predicting against future combinations of\r\nearthquake and water. This included seismographs that ring alarm bells\r\nat night. The object of science is always prediction and assisting\r\nhumanity; and the need is always for more men.\r\n\r\nAnother significant event of 1947 was the visit of Hans Pettersson of\r\nthe Oceanographic Institute of Sweden who was conducting an expedition\r\nwhich followed the path of the _Challenger_. The object of the\r\nproject was to study the oceanography of the sea bottom around the\r\nequator. Thus Pettersson was enthusiastic about my paper in _Natural\r\nHistory_ and its emphasis on studying sea bottoms. With him was\r\ninventor Kullenberg who had made a device for boring into the mud of\r\nthe sea bottom and taking longer cores than had been dug previously.\r\nHis apparatus consisted of a core barrel, tripped with valves close\r\nto the sea bottom under a heavy weight, which would allow it to sink\r\nsixty feet in suitable bottom ooze while the core rose inside the pipe\r\nwithout being compressed.\r\n\r\nPettersson had a skilled staff consisting of biologist, physicist,\r\nchemist, and geologist; and they had laboratories on board the\r\n_Albatross_ for study of the collected bottom materials. They\r\nalso took echo data of explosions near sea bottom, giving depths of\r\nsoft materials over hard rock. This place of transition was found to\r\nbe shallower under the Pacific Ocean than under the Atlantic. They\r\ndiscovered hard lava flows in many places between Tahiti and Hawaii\r\nand under the Indian Ocean, indicating extensive submarine volcanic\r\neruption. An attempt was made to measure the temperature of a core,\r\nand this suggested that the bottom of the boring was warmer than the\r\ntop, meaning a thermal gradient of sea bottom. A core of volcanic\r\nagglomerate was obtained in the deep trench opposite the East Indies.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period that President Gregg Sinclair of the\r\nUniversity of Hawaii urged a plan for geophysics of the Pacific, and\r\nProfessor R. W. Hiatt of that institution succeeded in advancing\r\ninterest in organic oceanography. I wrote an appeal, based on such work\r\nas that of Pettersson, Perret, and others urging the Regents of the\r\nUniversity to plan a large geophysical institute in Hawaii, to make a\r\nscience of the rock bottom of the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nThousands of soundings made in the Gulf of Alaska and in the central\r\nPacific had shown seamounts, or guyots, shaped like high volcanoes on\r\nthe sea floor, some of them with flat tops, but having characteristics\r\nof ancient isolated volcanoes. New soundings revealed mountain\r\nranges on the sea floor, probably volcanic, one of them right across\r\nthe middle of the Hawaiian chain. No one had yet discovered fiery\r\neruption in deep water, but oceanographers were beginning to use\r\nboring machines, cameras, electric lights, and devices for determining\r\nradioactivity of the muds. As sea bottom occupies three-quarters of the\r\nglobe, it is inconceivable, when compared with the continents, that\r\nit has no hot solfataras, hot springs, and hot volcanoes. In fact,\r\nwe know some of the latter in shallow water. It is only a question\r\nof scientific organization to locate the sources of Pettersson’s\r\nsubmarine lava flows. President Sinclair took to the chiefs of the\r\nRockefeller and Carnegie Foundations a proposal for a five million\r\ndollar Geophysical Institute at the University of Hawaii, to utilize\r\nthe advantages of its central Pacific position.\r\n\r\nAs for my own experiments, my Department of Volcanology at the\r\nUniversity was moved into a concrete basement room a thousand square\r\nfeet in area in the Home Economics building, and the expense was shared\r\nwith the Hawaiian Volcano Research Association. Here I had office and\r\nshop and collections of the Research Association, and the assistance\r\nof a secretary and a junior researcher who is an instrument maker.\r\nThus were assembled in a fire resistant location my petrographic and\r\nmineral collections from Europe, the Caribbean, Central America, and\r\nthe Pacific lands, together with manuscripts from my days of Harvard\r\nand Massachusetts Tech to the middle of the century and classified\r\naccumulations of my Navy monographs, lantern slides, negatives,\r\nphotographs, maps, drawings, correspondence, and instruments, including\r\nmaterial obtained by the Research Association for experiments still\r\ncontinuing on the hardness of minerals.\r\n\r\nOne objective of this hardness measurement was an instrument for\r\nmachine shops which would give in half a minute the length of a\r\nstandard scratch made by a standard dental disk of silicon carbide.\r\nI called this the “Jaggar Scratch Tester” and Mr. Paul Rushforth, a\r\nHonolulu optician, made improved models of the instrument. When a\r\nbook was published on the experiments with some three hundred woods,\r\nminerals, metals, and plastics, Dr. Grodzinski of the commercial\r\ndiamond establishments in London became interested and reproduced\r\nthe paper in a review dealing with industrial diamonds, which have\r\nbecome of great importance in the world of grinding machinery. This\r\nmade a new contact with England, similar to that made by Boynton with\r\nmy microsclerometer in 1908, when he applied it to the microscopic\r\nconstituents of steel under the British Iron and Steel Institute. I\r\nsent a copy of my new report to the Pearl Harbor industrial laboratory,\r\nalong with one of the instruments. Endorsers of this report were Mr. W.\r\nH. Hammond and Dr. Earl Ingerson, director of the mineral laboratories\r\nof the U.S. Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nA result of the experiments on hardness is the knowledge that the\r\nimportant quality is softness, or abradability, and speed of removal\r\nof material in any uniform mechanical cutting process. It was formerly\r\nthought that the big intervals in values were between the hard\r\nsubstances. It turns out that the biggest gaps in value are in soft\r\nsubstances like coals and clays and plasters. Hardness is purely a\r\nnegative quality of resistance, and measurements are of yielding, not\r\nof resisting.\r\n\r\nOther experiments on which I worked dealt with location of the Zenith\r\nin the sky for quick determination of latitude and longitude from stars\r\nand telescopic studies of the moon, an old hobby of my master, Shaler.\r\nI have long been convinced that Kilauea lava resembles moon lava in\r\nthe craters it builds, and my special interest is that Mauna Loa and\r\nKilauea build structures of basalt, small and large, which are earth\r\nexperiments imitating the moon on a smaller scale. The astronomers\r\nsay their field is the stars, the geologists must explain the moon.\r\nAs a matter of fact, one geologist has made a start. My classmate\r\nJ. E. Spurr, who after retirement to Florida from work as U.S.\r\nGeological Survey geologist among the faults and lavas of the far West,\r\npublished books on the comparison of the moon with geology. In view\r\nof increasing attempts to explain moon craters by impact (Baldwin), I\r\nfeel that experienced volcanologists should also take a hand in moon\r\nscience. Larger arcs of circles on the globe, the Aleutian Islands for\r\ninstance, resemble moon features and are deeply volcanic. Furthermore,\r\nmagnificent detailed photographs of the moon from modern telescopes\r\nare available to volcanology.\r\n\r\nI spent my summers at Hawaii National Park, becoming consulting\r\ngeophysicist. Dr. Chester K. Wentworth of the Board of Water Supply\r\nbecame geologist. The laboratories were extended to a seismograph\r\nstation seven miles up the northeast flank of Mauna Loa, but operation\r\nof the original cellar adjacent to the Volcano House was continued.\r\nA basement under the Natural History building of the Park held\r\nseismographs, Finch’s office and library, and Loucks’ shop.\r\n\r\nIn 1948 Observatory work was returned to the administration of the\r\nGeological Survey, and a volcanologic branch in Denver took over Dr.\r\nPowers to make airplane studies of the Aleutian Islands. This was under\r\nMr. Walter Frederick Hunt, in charge of geology, U.S. Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nWhen Hawaii National Park was reorganized, Frank Oberhansley,\r\nsuperintendent, the Natural History building was adopted as Park\r\nHeadquarters, and the Uwekahuna buildings, with their magnificent\r\nview in all directions, were reconstructed as the Hawaiian Volcano\r\nObservatory. A new seismograph cellar was dug, away from disturbances\r\nof Uwekahuna cliff, and modern instruments were installed. Mr. John\r\nForbes became assistant machinist; and on Mr. Finch’s retirement in\r\n1951, Dr. Gordon Macdonald became volcanologist in charge. C. K.\r\nWentworth moved from Honolulu to the National Park region and took\r\ncharge of magnetic measurement, which had been established at numerous\r\nstations by physicists of the Geological Survey. During past decades\r\nphysicists and chemists had visited the Observatory, among them\r\nDr. Stanley Ballard, who equipped the laboratories with a Gaertner\r\nspectrograph; Dr. Harvey White of Berkeley, who found no radioactivity\r\nin Hawaiian lavas; and Dr. J. J. Naughton, who found a critical isotope\r\nof carbon in the emanations of Sulphur Bank. Modern chemistry was\r\nbeginning to be applied to volcanology in the field, and this was what\r\nHovey, Perret, and I hoped for fifty years ago. So much for dry facts\r\nof organization.\r\n\r\nIn 1949 the summit crater of Mauna Loa erupted, with fracture and\r\noutflow of its south end toward Kona. This was followed in 1950 by\r\nlengthy rupture of the southwest rift with the most voluminous and\r\nrapid outflows of history, three of them going into the ocean and\r\nwreaking destruction in South Kona.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of these outflows was from high sources first, with others\r\nopening farther south, and the most conspicuous flows following the\r\nsteep Kona slope into the ocean, beginning at Hookena. Macdonald and\r\nNational Park naturalists photographed and recorded everything. The old\r\nHookena post office on the upper road at the home of the veteran Mr.\r\nLincoln was carried away, and this occasioned much drama, for the old\r\nman didn’t wish to leave his home. The next house destroyed, an old\r\nlandmark, was the Magoon Ranch. The third was the attractive and modern\r\nOhia Lodge, a resort built of native logs in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nA separate large flow forked away from the rift, to the eastern side\r\nof the mountain, reaching the lowest landward elevation in the forest\r\nof Kahuku, and short flows spilled over the southwest rift on the east\r\nside.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons approached the flows in South Kona from the ocean.\r\nThe early photographs of the first flows, where the hard sprouts and\r\nboulders of stiff aa partially cooled entered the ocean, showed big\r\ncolumns of vapor from contact with sea water. Not so with the third\r\nflow farthest south, explored from a canoe by Jack Matsumoto and a\r\ncompanion, equipped with motion picture cameras. The pictures were good\r\ncolor photographs, and the torrent of lava flowed down a steep bank\r\nof its own substance, hemmed in by hardened ridges at the sides, the\r\nstream intensely liquid and flowing directly into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe result was most remarkable. The yellow liquid lava went into the\r\nsalt water without making any column of steam at all; the sea bottom\r\nsimply received it with its rush downward, the water boiling superhot,\r\nand the lava taking the water vapor into itself. The phenomenon was not\r\ndue to the rising of dry steam, for there was no condensation cloud\r\nabove. Scientists explained it by assuming a shell of lava making a\r\ntunnel under the ocean, with the crust ending just at sea level.\r\n\r\nSuch a submarine arch was definitely not present, for the waves surged\r\nback and forth and, Matsumoto states, there was no sign of a submerged\r\nreef. The motion picture bears this out. What was probably going on\r\nis what happens to slag in a patented process of the steel mills,\r\nwhere the glow liquid is flowed over a perforated surface emitting\r\nhundreds of water jets, and the melt at 1300° Centigrade absorbs the\r\nwater without making visible steam. The slag turns into a myriad of\r\nmicroscopic glassy spheres, becoming a kind of pumice. A peculiarity\r\nof this substance is that if it is cooled at 700° Centigrade it will\r\npass a critical point and give up the absorbed water with explosive\r\neffects. It seems likely that Matsumoto’s golden torrent sweeping\r\ninto the ocean was so excessively hot that it took up the water and\r\ncontinued to flow down the sea bottom as a water-charged product. The\r\nsnapping and crackling effects, and the submarine earthquakes, making\r\nlocalized tidal waves such as those noted in 1919 when such a torrent\r\nentered the sea, may be due to the explosive cooling when the slag\r\ngives up its water.\r\n\r\nThe use of color motion pictures is one of the many improvements\r\nowed to modern science, and the mapping of lava flows by airplane\r\nphotography. This gave Macdonald a new weapon for surveying the volume\r\naccumulation at the time of the 1950 outflows, for from air photographs\r\nhe got exact outlines of the flows. These, checked against calculated\r\nthicknesses, gave him volumes which could be compared with volumes of\r\nolder flows proportionate to areas. These calculations showed that\r\nnothing since 1868 has yielded such large volumes of lava, per days of\r\noutflow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jaggar and I were returning to Hawaii from a trip to Nova Scotia,\r\nand the Matson steamer _Lurline_ took us to the Kona coast toward\r\nthe end of the 1950 eruption, for inspection of the glowing flows late\r\nat night. They looked like hot coals extending far up the mountainside\r\nunder the clouds, with occasional bright flares where trees burst into\r\nflame. Visible motion there was none, as we were too late for the\r\nrapid flowing and too far away to see detailed motion. This eruption\r\nresembled the voluminous flow of Mauna Loa in 1868, from a low vent\r\nat the south end of the mountain, and lasted only a short time after\r\npreliminary summit outbursts. The similarity was a big earthquake\r\nseries, and this was to happen again in Kona in 1951. The cataclysmal\r\nopening of the southwest rift in the nineteenth century eruption\r\nfollowed a quarter century of northern outflows, those from 1843 to\r\n1859. Next came those from 1929 to 1952 in the twentieth century. The\r\n1929 earthquakes subterraneously began the northern series.\r\n\r\nThe same argument applies to the twenty-six years of summit and\r\nsouthern outflows, from 1903 to 1929, which followed a quarter century\r\nof alternations north and south. None of this takes account of all the\r\nsummit crater outbreaks, the hinge line between the jostlings of the\r\nnorth and south rift sectors. Roughly the whole argument centers about\r\na supposed rocking of the Mauna Loa mountain sectors, northward and\r\nsouthward from the crater. The two rifts become stiff and seal up for\r\ntwenty-five years, and then break open for a new period of looseness.\r\nThe summit well is somehow full always.\r\n\r\nA remarkable event, namely repose of Kilauea for eighteen years\r\nafter 1934, may be another reaction. The previous excitement was\r\nthe buildup, collapse, and recovery of the mountain for the quarter\r\ncentury preceding 1934, with its culmination the steam blast in 1924 of\r\nunderground water, the dormancy of Kilauea beginning ten years later.\r\nKilauea in 1790 had a bigger explosive eruption, and was in repose for\r\neighteen years beginning ten years thereafter, namely in 1800. Thus\r\nit seems likely that Kilauea executes quarter centuries of crisis in\r\nits own right. These times are not exact, but are approximations of\r\nscientific search for order in a big machine, the Hawaiian volcanic\r\nsystem, where rhythmic pulsations exist wherever gravity operates. A\r\nthird of a century may prove more exact than the estimate of a quarter\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe end of this 1940 decade completes a half century of my experience\r\nof volcanoes and earthquakes, dwelling with a single crater, and\r\nlearning that volcanoes and earthquakes are tied together. They appear\r\ntied to deep ruptures 2,000 miles long, in the thick shell of the earth\r\nover a white hot liquid core.\r\n\r\nI have recently started an experiment with a thick globe of cement,\r\nmade with a shell, proportional in thickness to the earth’s crust,\r\nwhich is 1,800 miles deep, as all seismologists agree. Striking this\r\nshell with a sledge hammer, I find it breaks in straight lines at\r\nright angles to each other. Theory is bound to be influenced by the\r\nobservational answers derived from watching lava emerging from the\r\nmountain rifts, at the end of the long straight belt of rifts of the\r\nwhole Hawaiian chain.\r\n\r\nI continually review my own geological muddles, the controversies over\r\nsteam, flames, volcano swelling, explosion craters, layers in the\r\ncrust, weighting and underflowing, continental uplift, the globe’s\r\narmor plate, contraction wrinkling of basins of sediment, submarine\r\nvolcanoes, linear chains of volcanoes, siliceous shell, blocks lifted\r\nor sunk, planets solar or from the sun’s binary twin, original heat or\r\nradioactive heat, thick crust or thin shell, lava reservoirs or lava\r\ncore, pregeology ancestors of volcanoes, and craters on the moon. The\r\nonly way to calculate from observations on Hawaiian volcanoes is to\r\ncopy the mathematicians; namely, to guess at the answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                                 Envoi\r\n\r\n    “_Tho’ world on world in myriad myriads roll round us\r\n    Each with different powers and other forms of life than ours._”\r\n\r\n\r\nI have spent sixty years in qualitative experiments in geology. I began\r\nwith old volcanoes and geysers in the Yellowstone and the far west,\r\nand ended with experiments on the active Hawaiian volcano, Kilauea.\r\nBased on these experiments, I have written books about evolution of\r\ncraters, and about distinct peculiarities of explosive eruptions from\r\nunderground water.\r\n\r\nThe accusation that I am not orthodox in professional geology is false.\r\nProfessional geology is largely continental because its field work has\r\nbeen on continents. My work has been oceanic; my field, seventy percent\r\nof the earth’s surface, extending over a thick crust down to the earth\r\ncore. The earth core is fluid and massive and hot, as all geology\r\nagrees. Isostasy, which postulates a thin flexible shell, is violated\r\nby the ocean deeps and the volcanic ridges. Volcanic rift echelons like\r\nthe Cordillera and the Hawaiian ridge are too long to be generated as\r\nthe fracture of a crust fifty miles deep. The circularity and graduated\r\nsize in linear stretches of the Pacific arcs are functions of a\r\nfractured thick-shell sphere. Similar gradation of arcs is on the lunar\r\nsurface. Arguments, based on the knowledge of meteors, for an iron core\r\nand for large lunar craters are without analogy. Substratum theories,\r\nfrom Stübel to Daly, do not agree with oceanic volcanism. Gravitational\r\ncrust balance applies better to a primitive thick fault block crust\r\nthan to a thin shell. Earth lavas, as natural experimental models,\r\nimitate lunar features on small and large scales. Both make consistent\r\nhistory for two similar globes. Volcanology has to stand as global and\r\nancient, and any geologist may accept the reasonings here enumerated\r\nwithout being unorthodox.\r\n\r\nThe unquestioned certainties of modern seismology, the transmission of\r\nelastic waves through the globe to sensitive recording pendulums,\r\nare that the crust is 1,800 miles thick, that the core is a heavy ball\r\nof white hot fluid, and that its temperature at crustal contact has\r\nbeen estimated by Verhoogen at 2200° Centigrade. The deep crust is less\r\ndense than the core, and is commonly conceded to be basic heavy rock\r\nnot unlike stony meteorites. The outside shell under oceans, and over\r\nthree-quarters of the earth, is covered by basaltic lava, and wherever\r\nigneous rock has been formed by volcanic action, intrusive or extrusive\r\nblack basic lava recurs as dikes and outflows.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n                  ARMOR PLATE AT OCEANS\r\n                  ARMOR PLATE AT CONTINENTS\r\n                  EXTERIOR OF FUNDAMENTAL GLOBE TO WHICH ADJUSTMENT\r\n                    TENDS\r\n                  CORE LIMIT TO WHICH ADJUSTMENT TENDS\r\n    VOLC. OCEAN   CHAINS OF OCEAN VOLCANOES\r\n    VOLC. CONT.   CHAINS OF CONTINENTAL BORDER VOLCANOES\r\n\r\n  ON THE PAGE OPPOSITE _is a diagram of a hypothetical\r\n  globe section near the equator, showing oceans and continents\r\n  in true surface ratio; fault block segments of rigid crust\r\n  isostatically supported on a liquid core; sixteen volcanic\r\n  partitions, oceanic and continental; and Stübel’s “armorplate”\r\n  from pristine volcanic eruption. Possibly the profile is\r\n  tetrahedral. My argument for this globe section is based on the\r\n  following_:\r\n\r\n   A globe of core, siliceous shell, and armorplate was formed by\r\n   primitive volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\n   The shell resulted from external aggregation of solids and gases\r\n   and internal segregation about a molten core.\r\n\r\n   The fault blocks came from shrinkage of the shell over a liquid\r\n   core, adjusted by luni-solar gravitation and rotation through\r\n   the pre-geologic ages.\r\n\r\n   The continental and oceanic boundaries of the fault blocks were\r\n   determined by elevated and sunken blocks with core volcanism of\r\n   escaping gas melting walls and laying down an exterior siliceous\r\n   armorplate on the earliest solidified globe. This in continents\r\n   is the seismologists’ lighter exterior layer underlaid by denser\r\n   rock at the armorplate bottom.\r\n\r\n   Continental volcanism (VOLC.-CONT.) became differentiated from\r\n   oceanic volcanism, by light atmospheric pressure over the raised\r\n   blocks and much greater water pressure over three-quarters of\r\n   the earth, the sunken blocks.\r\n\r\n   The subdivision is represented in the diagrammatic section on\r\n   the globe by three-quarters of the section being ocean, namely\r\n   twelve-sixteenths.\r\n\r\n   The section shows twelve-sixteenths as sunken blocks,\r\n   four-sixteenths as raised blocks. The four sixteenths by the\r\n   tetrahedral hypothesis of Lowthian Green and Michel-Lévy make\r\n   the four continental protuberances.\r\n\r\n   Twelve-sixteenths of the surface is broken by fundamental rifts\r\n   of irregular shapes, some of them north-south, controlled by\r\n   centrifugal stresses and corresponding to the north-south deeps\r\n   and heaps and known rifts. These have persisted since the first\r\n   volcanism of primitive time.\r\n\r\n   Circum-continental volcanism is represented on the diagram by\r\n   VOLC.-CONT., oceanic volcanism is represented by VOLC.-OCEAN.\r\n   Both are shown as interblock rifts, adjusted through the\r\n   ages (exaggerated on the drawing) and always tensional over\r\n   expansional core pressure, with exothermal heating agencies.\r\n\r\n   The sixteen fundamental block boundaries correspond\r\n   approximately to sixteen fundamental volcanic fault blocks known\r\n   vaguely on the globe. Something similar is known on the moon.\r\n   The rifts are the boundaries of sixteen blocks, some polyhedral,\r\n   some elongate. Some are oceanic like New Zealand-Tonga, some\r\n   are ancient and continental like Arabia. The imperfectly\r\n   mapped ocean deeps are boundary lines. The rifts of Africa and\r\n   Chile-Patagonia are boundary lines. The great arcs of Himalaya,\r\n   Java-Sumatra, and Aleutian ridges are boundary lines of circular\r\n   blocks. Possibly they were circular calderas of engulfment on\r\n   the primitive spheroid. The edge of Mare Imbrium on the moon\r\n   shows fault rifts. The straight alignment of lunar calderas\r\n   hints at moon rifts under an unmapped mosaic. The blocks of the\r\n   theory of continental drift, are guesses at a mosaic of crust\r\n   blocks. But the possibility drift theory omitted is that the\r\n   blocks are deep. Except for the Lowthian Green, Wegener, Holmes,\r\n   and Daly speculations, based on thin crust blocks of continents,\r\n   no mapping of the shell mosaic exists. It is not feasible until\r\n   we map the detail of ocean bottoms. Primitive blocks require\r\n   acceptance of a thick crust and justify new speculation. The\r\n   cracks between blocks are the volcanic partitions of the earth,\r\n   which I call ignisepts.\r\n\r\n   There are many points for speculation, some of them subject\r\n   to mathematical inquiry. Does surface water penetrate the\r\n   partitions? Is it high pressure and saline under oceans? How\r\n   do deep earthquakes stem from friction 300 miles down under\r\n   the Cordillera and the west Pacific? Do earth and moon spheres\r\n   as rounded tetrahedra crack similarly? Because of rotation\r\n   are north-south cracks dominant? Are the core fluids changing\r\n   volcanism through the ages?]\r\n\r\nThe twenty-eight percent of earth surface which lies above the sea in\r\ncontinents is made up of siliceous sediments of shallow water basins,\r\nwith quartz as the dominant mineral, their strata wrinkled, and eroded\r\ninto mountain ranges. Desert and lake or river bottoms make up most of\r\nthe remainder. This material, when ancient, was changed by heat and\r\ninfiltration into what are called gneisses, schists, and granites; and\r\nthe process of granitization is among the metamorphic processes. It\r\nis a process of deep burial, heat, gases, and water which has always\r\nbeen a puzzle, and may affect ancient volcanic lavas wherever they\r\nhave covered the land. It is a process of solution of silica, and its\r\ndeposition is by steam and other vapors.\r\n\r\nIn the same way volcanic action by the outpouring of lava through\r\ncracks is a process of solution of the deeper crust of the earth by hot\r\ngases, largely burning hydrogen. Lavas emerging from Etna or Mauna Loa\r\nare melted earth crust, dissolved and brought up by this same hydrogen\r\nand by other gases from the walls of profound cracks leading down to\r\nthe earth core. Volcanism and metamorphism are thus the same process,\r\nnamely the action of gases up cracks through deep earth crust. But\r\nmetamorphism acts on continental sediments, whereas modern volcano\r\neruption acts through sea bottom and sea shore faulting, very ancient\r\nfeatures of the earth and distinct from continents. In Hawaii no\r\nmetamorphic rock fragments have been found.\r\n\r\nSuch primitive oceanic fault fissures extend under continents remnant\r\nfrom the time of evolution of continents. They bring up the metamorphic\r\nhot gases, which in siliceous sediments, make granites and gneisses and\r\nschists with the aid of groundwater. Geology has no knowledge whatever\r\nof whether this metamorphic process affects the hard rock under the\r\noceanic muds, because geology has never collected a piece of that rock.\r\nGeology however knows inclusions and explosive fragments from oceanic\r\nvolcanoes, and it does not find there granite and gneiss and schist.\r\nHowever, generalization does not apply to continental volcanoes like\r\nthose of Italy and Africa.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of fossils on continents is commonly considered to have\r\nbeen 500 million years ago, and this may be extended another 1,500\r\nmillion years for the most ancient identifiable continental rocks,\r\nand an estimated total thickness of 120,000 feet to the bottom of the\r\nmost ancient sediments on earth. We know nothing of thickness of most\r\nancient volcanic deposits under the oceanic mud.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the great German explorer Stübel, who mapped\r\nvolcanoes of the Andes, founded a museum of his work in Leipzig, and\r\npublished monographs on the Andes. He wrote a final book, including\r\nmaterial on Mount Pelée, on the “genetic differences of volcanic\r\nmountains.” But such modern continentalists as Daly and Bucher in\r\nAmerica have disregarded Stübel. Daly is the authority on a shallow\r\nearth shell and substratum of basalt, and Bucher of Columbia University\r\nis a specialist on continental sediments and granitization.\r\n\r\nThe point is that Stübel made a profound generalization which nobody\r\nhas proved wrong. The earth is at least 3,000 million years old, and\r\nwhen oceanic fault blocks sank and received condensing atmospheric\r\nwater and continental fault blocks remained high and became eroded,\r\nthere was already a thick shell of volcanic lavas. For volcanism\r\nwas the most ancient process on the earth’s surface. It had always\r\nbrought gases up cracks from the core, making atmosphere, water, and\r\nextrusions. Stübel, called the extrusive shell on the outside of the\r\nprimitive crust the globe’s armorplate. The primal gas escape, whatever\r\nthe ancestral turbulence inside, had to come up cracks and make\r\nvolcanic deposits. It is commonly presumed that the very thick inside\r\ncrust formed rapidly by cooling and solidifying from outside the core\r\ninward, and from inside the atmosphere outward. The latter surface\r\nwas eventually under water cooling over most of the earth and under\r\nair cooling over the small continental area, a marked difference of\r\ntemperature and pressure for the two areas.\r\n\r\nSeismometry teaches that most of the crust is of fairly uniform\r\ndensity. Therefore, presumably, a thick crust was arrived at early.\r\nThere was obviously a time of conflict between the weighting of the\r\ncrust by its heavier accumulations next to the core, by its lighter\r\naccumulations exteriorly under water and air, and finally by its\r\nexternal armor plate of unknown comparative weight, made of volcanic\r\nlava. For all we know, this might have been volcanic pumice. Rapidity\r\nof crust thickening is speculative.\r\n\r\nRight here there is an element of mystery in speculation as to which\r\nhas to accommodate comparison with the moon, the merging of atmospheric\r\ncondensation with volcanism, and the merging of suboceanic condensation\r\nof lava with pristine eruption. This is too hard a nut to crack, in\r\nour current ignorance of rock under sea bottom muds. But Stübel’s\r\ninsistence on a coating of lava armor plate over both continents and\r\nsea bottoms as the earlier volcanism, and an external veneer on the\r\nearth, is unavoidable. If it were all basalt like the present oceanic\r\nvolcanoes, we should find basalt in continents underneath the granites.\r\nWe do not do so. If it were all light weight granitizing by segregation\r\nof silica, we should find commonly granite and obsidian fragments\r\nwithin oceanic lavas. We do not do so. We have to conclude then that\r\nour sections, topographic and geologic, do not go deep enough. And\r\nas for the ocean bottoms, we have no sections at all. But Stübel was\r\nright. An unknown volcanic eruption period had to precede geologic\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe question of ancient greenstones in Africa, Scandinavia, and Canada\r\nis much discussed, for there were old volcanic lavas in many places;\r\nmixed with gneisses, schists, and granites. They were not a deep\r\nlayer, but presumed to be ancient remnants of interspersed lavas among\r\nsediments. They are one more evidence that volcanic eruption goes\r\nback to the time of the most ancient rocks on continents and that its\r\nlavas were affected by metamorphism. But no continuous deep stratum of\r\ngreenstones is known. At depths of fifty miles, under continents only,\r\nis the Mohorovicic change to denser rock. This is an echo surface in\r\nearthquake waves, but it is absent over the whole Pacific. It may be\r\nthe top of the armor plate.\r\n\r\nJustice Holmes wrote that the Constitution of the United States\r\nwas an experiment. That all law of the nation works salvation by\r\nprophecy based on experiment. The experiments were extended to the\r\nBill of Rights and all the amendments to the Constitution. I feel\r\nthat geology--in view of its extreme ignorance of submarine rocks,\r\nores, metals, oils, spring waters, temperatures, magnetism, gravity,\r\nand gases for most of the earth--needs a bill of rights and numerous\r\namendments to its constitution. Its salvation by prophecy needs to\r\nbe based on experiments with instruments, drill rigs, and anchored\r\nlaboratories in this vast area. These experiments, superficially,\r\nhave been conducted by oceanographic sampling of bottom materials, by\r\ngravity pendulums operated in submarines, by cameras on sea bottoms,\r\nand collections of bottom waters, by tests of radioactivity of\r\nbottom materials, by echo sounding to determine thickness of muds,\r\nby volcanology on oceanic islands, by topographic surveying of the\r\nbottom, and by all the excellent work of the oceanographic and geologic\r\nstations and their seismographs, with some studies of marine chemistry,\r\nphysics, and biology. The conclusions in this book amount to only one\r\nsmall prophecy based on experiments with volcanoes. But the rock under\r\ndeep ocean mud is still uncollected.\r\n\r\nMy volcano experiments are not influenced by any consensus of text\r\nbooks. I was educated on textbook opinions and found geologic science\r\ndeficient in experimental measurement of the field progress of\r\nerosion, sedimentation, deformation, and eruption. I expended most of\r\nmy teaching in a plea for field observatories of time measurement of\r\nthese four processes. The plea has done some good, and in this century\r\nwe have seen grow up the International Geophysical Union. Experiment\r\nstations have multiplied, to make geophysics and geochemistry pure\r\nquantitative sciences. But they are generally commercial and have not\r\nextended to deep boring under oceans.\r\n\r\nWhile working from volcano observatories for the extension of geology\r\nin Alaska, Japan, Hawaii, Tonga, the Caribbean and Italy, and on the\r\nmainland of California, Central America, and New Zealand, I have found\r\nmyself on the outskirts of vast oceans, engaged in a science almost as\r\nunsatisfactory as the textbook science of historical and continental\r\ngeology. It is always a compromise, for we are up against a crying need\r\nfor maps of the bedrock under the muds of the vast oceans. Volcanism\r\ncries out for a knowledge of the globe, and it is helped by such work\r\nas that of Gutenberg and Richter. These men compiled critical maps of\r\nearthquakes, measured by elastic theory the world over. Their work\r\nnecessarily made many contacts with volcanoes. The same may be said\r\nof the geophysical summaries of gravity, magnetism, climatology,\r\nhydrology, and oceanography. But all our sciences stop at the immense\r\nsea bottoms, and need salvation through experiment.\r\n\r\nScience is not doing all it can. Finances and engineering are competent\r\nto contact sea bottom directly with expensive machines not yet invented\r\nand to create oceanic rock science. Offshore boring for oil is not\r\nenough. Pure science needs an example by financiers like Carnegie and\r\nRockefeller who are not seeking profit. Engineering advice positively\r\ncan reach under the few hundred feet of mud, find the rock, and bore\r\ninto it in 2,000 fathoms. The first man who does it will open a\r\nnew frontier. All honor to Shepard, Ewing, Piggot, Pettersson, and\r\nKullenberg, men who have barely broken ground in this science. The\r\nwhole of volcanology depends on collecting the crustal rock under the\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nHoyle’s book “The Nature of the Universe” takes us one step farther.\r\nIt shows that all science is essentially cosmology, and science deals\r\nwith the origin and progress of all nature. I would go farther than the\r\nuniverse. I would include the science of life and of our brains. We\r\nneed an imaginative picture starting with the outer universe. We end on\r\nthe earth with volcanoes and the birth of life.\r\n\r\nHoyle and Lyttleton of Cambridge have presented a condensation of\r\ncurrent astrophysics, which includes earth, moon, and planets; sun\r\nand stars; origin and future of stars; and origin of solar systems. A\r\nmost gratifying conclusion is that the background material of space\r\ncreates hydrogen. This is proved by precise mathematical equations.\r\nThis accounts for the expanding universe under the pressure of such\r\ncreation. The outermost nebulae continually pass beyond the speed of\r\nlight. The galaxies move out into infinite space endlessly. They are\r\nrenovated endlessly by gravitation from hydrogen eternally created.\r\n\r\nThe sun, by knowledge built up from the days of Jeans and Eddington,\r\ncontains more than ninety percent of hydrogen, and the small remainder\r\nis helium, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and iron. It maintains its surface\r\ntemperature by nuclear reactions from within outward, at a rate\r\nsuitable to make helium out of hydrogen, so as to compensate for the\r\nenergy which the sun radiates.\r\n\r\nThis dominance of hydrogen inside the solar star makes it impossible\r\nthat the earth should be solar. Rather, it was a product of a companion\r\nstar, a supernova which exploded and, with excessive heat, created\r\nelements atomically. The sun was a binary pair of stars, and the\r\ncompanion occupied the place of the four greater planets. The remnant\r\nbody, after explosion, moved away.\r\n\r\nA gaseous ring formed around the sun condensing from many molecules\r\nto rotating superplanets. These broke up many hundred million years\r\nago into Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Small blobs escaped to\r\nbecome the inner planets including the earth. The earth captured small\r\nsolids and acquired the moon as a satellite. It got radioactive matter\r\nexteriorly, plus nitrogen, water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nThere is a hundred times more hydrogen per unit of mass in the sun than\r\nin the planets. Its supply will last for 50,000 million years. The\r\nsolar system is tunneling through variable interstellar gas. It picks\r\nup more or less material, and so changes climates occasionally. This\r\nmakes such episodes as the ice ages on earth. Lyttleton estimates that\r\nthe dust clouds encountered form bundles of particles captured by the\r\nsun to make comets.\r\n\r\nThe mathematics of the interior of the sun, applied by Bethe to the use\r\nof carbon and nitrogen as catalysts and changing hydrogen to helium, is\r\na model of experimentation. It should be imitated to explain Hawaiian\r\nbasalt. The core of the earth produces gas reactions up cracks. The\r\ngases act on deep crust. The surface product is olivine basalt.\r\nWhat are the reactions between gas and crust to make Mauna Loa foam\r\nfountains? This problem has not been tackled. Geologists have clung to\r\na theory of shallow reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe astronomers of Cambridge, successors of the American experimenter\r\nGeorge Ellery Hale and of Eddington and Jeans, are not the final word\r\nin cosmology. There will be a final word. The picture created from\r\nbackground material to gas, from gas to galaxies, and from galaxies to\r\nsolar systems ends for us in our planet with a white hot liquid core.\r\nNuclear reactions created this from the superheat of an exploding\r\nsupernova. Our erupting volcanoes are the end product. We can sit\r\nbeside erupting lava fountains and watch hydrogen flames, the same gas\r\nthat was made of the background material in the universe.\r\n\r\nAll this is outcome of gravitation. It extends from the first eddies of\r\nhydrogen in outer space to the final rotation of the earth. The final\r\nhydrogen, with carbon, made life on the earth. The five elements of\r\nvolcanic gas are identical with the five elements of organic chemistry.\r\nDr. Hoyle mistakenly concludes that we have no clue to our own fate.\r\nBut he points out that the universe is continuous creation. Our picture\r\nis one instant of time in an everlasting now. Mind is an everlasting\r\nunit beyond which we cannot go.\r\n\r\nIt is illogical to pay any attention to existence after death unless\r\nwe pay equal attention to existence before birth. All is continuous\r\ncreation. The making of hydrogen is just as true within the creation\r\nof life as within the universe. Life is under gravitation. Gravitation\r\ncontrols the instantaneous moving picture, even the emergence of life\r\nfrom volcanic gases under enormous water pressure at sea bottom. It\r\nis just as much subject to experiment as the outer boundary of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nLife is an end product; and it thinks, worships, and experiments.\r\nTreating life and volcanoes as end products of Hoyle’s universe makes\r\nscience fundamentally cosmology.\r\n\r\nOne final comment, after looking at sea bottom eruptions through all\r\nthe ages. Continental life came out of the sea, and original life comes\r\ncontinually from the earth core. This gives new dignity to the future\r\nsearch for global action on the sea bottom.\r\n\r\nThe “emergent evolution” of Lloyd Morgan makes much of mutation as\r\naccounting for progress from unconscious life to consciousness,\r\nconsciousness to memory, memory to reasoning, and reasoning to\r\nspirituality. Each one of these is a new mutation, in the same sense as\r\na new fruit by Burbank. The first unconscious life may be considered\r\na mutation from the inorganic of the globe. The totally unknown\r\npressure-temperature conditions of volcanic eruption through the\r\ncracking earth of ocean bottom, and the ground waters under the ocean,\r\nlend a final dignity to exploration of that frontier.\r\n\r\nHoyle writes that the ultimate goal of the New Cosmology is continuous\r\ncreation in outer space. The ultimate goal of the New Volcanology is\r\ncontinuous creation in oceanic depths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n              A\r\n\r\n    =aa=, 54, 67, 78, 104, 121, 124, 125, 129, 148, 174\r\n\r\n    Abbot, 159\r\n\r\n    Absaroka Range, 8\r\n\r\n    Adak Harbor, 141\r\n\r\n    Adams, C.
