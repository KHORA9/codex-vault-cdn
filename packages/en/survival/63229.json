It is very apt to get into the trunks and satchels\r\nof travelers, or into baskets of laundry, and may thus be introduced into\r\nhomes. Unfortunately, also, it is quite capable of migrating from one\r\nhouse to another and will often continue to come from an adjoining house,\r\nsometimes for a period of several months, gaining entrance daily. Such\r\nmigration is especially likely to take place if the human inhabitants of\r\nan infested house leave it. With the failure of their usual source of\r\nfood, the migratory instinct of the bedbugs is developed, and, escaping\r\nthrough windows, they pass along walls, water pipes, or gutters, and thus\r\ngain entrance into adjoining houses. In these or other ways anyone's\r\npremises may be temporarily invaded.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the presence of the bedbug in houses, both from the\r\nstandpoint of personal comfort and the possible carriage of disease, is\r\nnot to be lightly considered, and the failure on the part of anyone to\r\ninstitute immediate efforts of eradication will warrant the odium which\r\nis properly attached to \"buggy\" premises. The most important purpose of\r\nthis bulletin is, in addition to giving a general account of this house\r\npest, to indicate effective means by which it can be eradicated promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=ORIGIN; COMMON NAMES; DISTRIBUTION.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with nearly all the insects associated with man, the bedbug has had the\r\nhabits now characteristic of it as far back as the records run. It was\r\nundoubtedly of common occurrence in the dwellings of the ancient peoples\r\nof Asia. The Romans were well acquainted with it, giving it the name\r\nCimex. It was supposed by Pliny--and this was doubtless the common belief\r\namong the Romans--to have medicinal properties, and it was recommended,\r\namong other things, as a specific for the bites of serpents. It is said to\r\nhave been first introduced into England in 1503, but the references to it\r\nare of such a nature as to make it very probable that it had been there\r\nlong before. Two hundred and fifty years later it was reported to be very\r\nabundant in the seaport towns, but was scarcely known inland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Bedbug (_Cimex lectularius_): _a_, Adult female,\r\nengorged with blood; _b_, same from below; _c_, rudimentary wing pad;\r\nmouth parts, _a, b_, Much enlarged; _c_, highly magnified. (Author's\r\nillustration.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the old English names was \"wall-louse.\" It was afterward very\r\nwell known as the \"chinch,\" which continued to be the common appellation\r\nfor it until within a century or two, and is still used in parts of this\r\ncountry. The origin of the name \"bedbug\" is not known, but it is such a\r\ndescriptive one that it would seem to have been very naturally suggested.\r\nAlmost everywhere there are local names for these parasites, as, for\r\nillustration, around Boston they are called \"chintzes\" and \"chinches,\" and\r\nfrom Baltimore comes the name \"mahogany flat,\" while in New York they are\r\nstyled \"red coats,\" and in the west \"crimson ramblers.\"\r\n\r\nThe bedbug has accompanied man wherever he has gone. Ships are very\r\napt to be infested with it and have been the chief means of its wide\r\ndistribution. It probably came to this country with the earliest\r\ncolonists; at least Kalm, writing in 1748-49, stated that it was plentiful\r\nin the English colonies and in Canada, though unknown among the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=VARIETIES AND RELATED INSECTS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat may eventually prove to be mere variations of the ordinary type of\r\nhuman bedbug have been described as distinct species in several instances.\r\nFor example, the common bedbug of southern Asia is supposed to present\r\nsome slight variations from the European type, chiefly in being somewhat\r\nmore elongate. These slightly diverging forms of the bedbug in different\r\nparts of the world, which are not known to have any special bird or animal\r\nhost other than human beings, may prove to be merely local races or\r\nvarieties of the ordinary bedbug.\r\n\r\nBirds, bats, and poultry are attacked in various parts of the world by\r\na considerable number of parasitic bugs, closely related to the bedbug,\r\nwhich live on their hosts and in nests and about roosting places. One of\r\nthese species, occurring abundantly in southwestern United States and\r\nMexico,[2] probably originally a parasitic messmate on birds and bats, has\r\ncome to be an unmitigated poultry pest, and from the close association in\r\nthese regions between poultry and human beings, is often a serious house\r\npest--more so even than the true bedbug. Others of the species infesting\r\nbirds and bats may also on occasion become house pests. For example, the\r\nnests of the common barn or eaves swallow of this country often swarm with\r\nthe barn-swallow bug,[3] and from such nests under the eaves of dwelling\r\nhouses these bugs sometimes gain entrance to houses and beds and are the\r\ncause of much annoyance. Similarly a species,[4] normally a parasite of\r\nbirds and bats in the Old World, and also in Brazil and the West Indies,\r\nnot infrequently becomes a human parasite.\r\n\r\n[2] (_Cimex_) _Haematosiphon inodora_ Dugès.\r\n\r\n[3] (_Cimex_) _Oeciacus hirundinis_ Jenyns.\r\n\r\n[4] _Cimex hemipterus_ Fab. (synonym, _rotundatus_ Sign.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bedbug belongs to the order Hemiptera, which includes the true bugs or\r\npiercing insects, characterized by possessing a piercing and sucking beak.\r\nThe bedbug is to man what the chinch bug is to grains or the squash bug\r\nto cucurbs. Like nearly all the insects parasitic on animals, however, it\r\nis degraded structurally, its parasitic nature and the slight necessity\r\nfor extensive locomotion having resulted, after many ages doubtless, in\r\nthe loss of wings and the assumption of a comparatively simple structure.\r\nBefore feeding, the adult (fig. 2) is much flattened, oval, and in\r\ncolor is rust red, with the abdomen more or less tinged with black.\r\nWhen engorged the body becomes much bloated and elongated and brightly\r\ncolored from the ingested blood. The wings are represented by the merest\r\nrudiments, barely recognizable pads, and the simple eyes or ocelli of\r\nmost other true bugs are lacking. The absence of wings is a most fortunate\r\ncircumstance, since otherwise there would be no safety from it even for\r\nthe most careful of housekeepers. Some slight variation in length of wing\r\npads has been observed, but none with wings showing any considerable\r\ndevelopment has ever been found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Bedbug: Adult before engorgement. Much enlarged.\r\n(Author's illustration.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE \"BUGGY\" ODOR.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic feature of the bedbug is the very distinct and\r\ndisagreeable odor which it exhales, an odor well known to all who have\r\nbeen familiar with it as the \"buggy\" odor. This odor is by no means\r\nlimited to the bedbug, but is characteristic of most plant bugs also. The\r\ncommon chinch bug affecting small grains and the squash bugs all possess\r\nthis odor, and it is quite as pungent with these plant-feeding forms as\r\nwith the human parasite. The possession of this odor, disagreeable as\r\nit is, is very fortunate after all, as it is of considerable assistance\r\nin detecting the presence of these vermin. The odor comes from glands,\r\nsituated in various parts of the body, which secrete a clear, oily,\r\nvolatile liquid. With the plant-feeding forms this odor is certainly a\r\nmeans of protection against insectivorous birds, rendering these insects\r\nobnoxious or distasteful to their feathered enemies. With the bedbug, on\r\nthe other hand, it is probably an illustration of a very common phenomenon\r\namong animals, i. e., the persistence of a characteristic which is no\r\nlonger of any especial value to the possessor. The natural enemies of true\r\nbugs, against which this odor serves as a means of protection, in the\r\nconditions under which the bedbug lives, are kept away from it; and the\r\nroach, which sometimes feeds on bedbugs, is evidently not deterred by the\r\nodor, while the common house ant and the house centipede, which may also\r\nattack the bedbug, seem not to find this odor disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=HABITS AND LIFE HISTORY.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bedbug is normally nocturnal in habits and displays a certain degree\r\nof wariness, caution, and intelligence in its efforts at concealment\r\nduring the day. Under the stress of hunger, however, it will emerge\r\nfrom its place of concealment in a well-lighted room at night, so that\r\nunder such circumstances keeping the gas or electric light burning is\r\nnot a complete protection. It has been known under similar conditions to\r\nattack human beings voraciously in broad daylight. It usually leaves its\r\nvictim as soon as it has become engorged with blood and retires to its\r\nnormal place of concealment, either in cracks in the bedstead, especially\r\nif the latter be one of the wooden variety, or behind wainscoting, or\r\nunder loose wall paper, and in these and similar places it manifests its\r\ngregarious habit by collecting in masses. It thrives particularly in\r\nfilthy apartments and in old houses which are full of cracks and crevices,\r\nin which it can conceal itself beyond easy reach. As just noted the\r\nold-fashioned, heavy, wooden-slatted bedsteads afford especially favorable\r\nsituations for the concealment and multiplication of this insect, and the\r\ngeneral use in later years of iron and brass bedsteads has very greatly\r\nfacilitated its eradication. Such beds, however, do not insure safety, as\r\nthe insects are able to find places of concealment even about such beds,\r\nor get to them readily from their other hiding places.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary stories are current of the remarkable intelligence of this\r\ninsect in circumventing various efforts to prevent its gaining access\r\nto beds. Most of these are undoubtedly exaggerations, but the inherited\r\nexperience of many centuries of companionship with man, during which\r\nthe bedbug has always found its host an active enemy, has resulted in a\r\nknowledge of the habits of the human animal and a facility of concealment,\r\nparticularly as evidenced by its abandoning beds and often going to\r\ndistant quarters for protection and hiding during daylight, which indicate\r\nconsiderable apparent intelligence.\r\n\r\nLike its allies, the bedbug undergoes what is known as an incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis. In other words, the insect from its larval to its adult\r\nstage is active and similar in form, structure, and habit, contrasting\r\nwith flies and moths in their very diverse life stages of larva,\r\nchrysalis, or pupa, and winged adult.\r\n\r\nThe eggs (fig. 3, _d_) are white oval objects having a little projecting\r\nrim around one edge and may be found in batches of from 6 to 50 in cracks\r\nand crevices where the parent bugs go for concealment. In confinement eggs\r\nmay be deposited almost daily over a period of two months or more and\r\ncommonly at the rate of from one to five eggs per day, but sometimes much\r\nlarger batches are laid. As many as 190 eggs have been thus obtained from\r\na single captured female.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Girault, A. A. Preliminary studies on the biology of the bedbug,\r\n_Cimex lectularius_, Linn. III. Facts obtained concerning the habits of\r\nthe adult. _In_ Jour. Econ. Biol., v. 9, no. 1, p. 25-45. 1914.\r\n\r\nThe eggs hatch in a week or 10 days in the hot weather of midsummer, but\r\ncold may lengthen or even double this egg period or check development\r\naltogether. The young escape by pushing up the lid-like top with its\r\nprojecting rim. When first emerged (fig. 3, _a, b_) they are yellowish\r\nwhite and nearly transparent, the brown color of the more mature insect\r\nincreasing with the later molts (fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Bedbug: Egg and newly hatched larva: _a_, Larva\r\nfrom below; _b_, larva from above; _c_, claw; _d_, egg; _c_, hair or spine\r\nof larva.

Greatly enlarged. (Author's\r\nillustration.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of its development the bedbug molts or sheds its\r\nskin normally five times, and with the last molt the minute wing pads,\r\ncharacteristic of the adult insect, make their appearance. A period of\r\nabout 11 weeks was formerly supposed to be necessary for the complete\r\nmaturity of the insect, but breeding experiments with this insect,\r\nconducted in this department in. 1896, indicated that the life cycle is\r\nsubject to great variation, being entirely dependent on warmth and food\r\nsupply. Under favorable conditions of temperature and food it was found\r\nthat there was an average period of about eight days between moltings\r\nand between the laying of eggs and their hatching, giving about seven\r\nweeks as the period under these conditions from egg to adult insect. The\r\nmolting periods are shorter in the earlier stages and lengthen in the\r\nlater stages. There are many exceptions, however, and some individuals\r\neven under the same conditions remain two or three weeks without molting.\r\nUnder conditions of famine, or without food, as already shown, the bedbug\r\nmay remain unchanged in any of the immature stages for an indefinite\r\ntime, and the checking of development by such starvation may result in\r\nadditional molting periods.\r\n\r\nThe breeding records referred to, and numerous confirmatory experiments\r\nsubsequently made by other investigators, indicate that ordinarily but one\r\nmeal is taken between molts, so that each bedbug must puncture its host\r\nfive times before becoming mature, and at least once afterwards before\r\nit can develop eggs. Additional meals between molts may be taken under\r\nfavoring circumstances, however, and particularly when the insect has been\r\ndisturbed and has not become fully engorged at its first meal after a\r\nmolting or other period. The bedbug takes from 5 to 10 minutes to become\r\nbloated with blood, and then retires to its place of concealment for 6 to\r\n10 days for the quiet digestion of its enormous meal, and for subsequent\r\nmolting, or reproduction if in the adult stage.\r\n\r\nSuch feeding and reproduction may, under favorable conditions of\r\ntemperature, continue throughout the year, and in one instance the\r\nprogeny of a captured female adult was carried through three continuous\r\ngenerations.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] Girault, A. A. Preliminary studies on the biology of the bedbug,\r\n_Cimex lectularius_, Linn. II. Facts obtained concerning the duration of\r\nits different stages. _In_ Jour. Econ. Biol., v. 7, no. 4, p. 163-188.\r\n1912.\r\n\r\nUnfavorable conditions of temperature and food will necessarily result in\r\ngreat variation in the number of generations annually and in the rate of\r\nmultiplication, but allowing for reasonable checks on development, there\r\nmay be at least four successive broods in a year in houses kept well\r\nheated in winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=FOOD AND LONGEVITY.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions the food of the common bedbug is obtained from\r\nhuman beings only, and no other unforced feeding habit has been reported.\r\nIt is easily possible, however, to force the bedbug to feed on mice, rats,\r\nbirds, etc., and probably it may do so occasionally in nature in the\r\nabsence of its normal host. The abundance of this insect in houses which\r\nhave long been untenanted may occasionally be accounted for by such other\r\nsources of food, but probably normally such infestation can be explained\r\nby the natural longevity of the insect and its ability to survive for\r\npractically a year, and perhaps more, without food.\r\n\r\nThere are many records indicating the ability of the bedbug to survive\r\nfor long periods without food, and specimens have been kept for a year\r\nin a sealed vial with absolutely no means of sustenance whatever. In the\r\ncourse of the department's study of this insect in 1896, young bedbugs,\r\nobtained from eggs, were kept in small sealed vials for several months,\r\nremaining active in spite of the fact that they had never taken any\r\nnourishment whatever. A considerable series of experiments was later\r\nconducted by Girault[7] bearing on the longevity of the insect under\r\ndifferent conditions. A large number of adults of both sexes were kept\r\nin confinement, but with normal feeding and mating, and these survived\r\nfor periods ranging from 54 to 316 days. Similarly, the life of 71 newly\r\nhatched larvæ, without food, ranged from 17 to 42 days, averaging about 28\r\ndays. Partly grown captured insects lived without further feeding from 17\r\nto 60 days. Longevity is naturally affected more or less by temperatures.\r\nIn other words, temperatures sufficient to check the activity of the\r\ninsect and produce hibernation or semihibernation are apt to increase\r\nlongevity.\r\n\r\n[7] Loc. cit.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the bedbug is able to survive for such long periods without\r\nhuman blood has led to the theory that it could subsist in some fashion\r\non the moisture from wood or from accumulations of dust in crevices in\r\nflooring, etc. There seems to be no basis of observed fact for this idea.\r\n\r\nAnother very prevalent belief among the old settlers in the West, that\r\nthis insect normally lives on dead or diseased cottonwood logs, and is\r\nalmost certain to abound in log houses of this wood, seems to be equally\r\ndevoid of basis. As illustrating this belief, the department has on\r\nfile a very definite report from an Army officer that the bedbug often\r\noccurs in numbers under the bark of dead cottonwood trees,[8] especially\r\nalong the Big Horn and Little Horn Rivers in Montana. The basis of this\r\nreport and the origin of this very general misconception is probably, as\r\npointed out by the late Prof. Riley, due to a confusion of the bedbug with\r\nthe immature stages of an entirely distinct insect,[9] which somewhat\r\nresembles the bedbug and often occurs under cottonwood bark.\r\n\r\n[8] _Populus monilifera._\r\n\r\n[9] _Aradus_ sp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE.=\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a messmate of human beings in dwelling houses, the bedbug is normally\r\nprotected from extreme cold, and is known to be an abundant and serious\r\npest far north. In fact, it is often more troublesome in north temperate\r\nlatitudes than farther south. This may be accounted for partly by the fact\r\nthat the bedbug is very sensitive to high temperatures, and a temperature\r\nof 96° to 100° F. or more, accompanied with a fairly high degree of\r\nhumidity, results in the death of large numbers of the bugs. The mature\r\nor partly mature bedbugs can stand comparatively low temperatures, even\r\nbelow freezing, for a considerable period. The eggs and newly hatched\r\nlarvæ, however, succumb to a temperature below freezing, if this condition\r\nis prolonged for from 15 days to a month. The feeding and developing\r\nactivity of the insect practically ceases at 60° F., the insect remaining\r\nquiescent and in semihibernation at temperatures below this point. The\r\nmost favorable temperatures for activity are between 60° and 98° F.[10]\r\nThe activity of the insect is controlled entirely by temperature and food\r\nsupply, and, therefore, in heated houses the insect may remain active\r\nthroughout the winter. There is some protection in winter, therefore, in\r\nsleeping in cold bedrooms.\r\n\r\n[10] Bacot, A. W. The influence of temperature, submersion, and burial\r\non the survival of eggs and larvæ of _Cimex lectularius_. _In_ Bul. Ent.\r\nRes., v. 5, pt. 2, p. 111-117. 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE BITE OF THE BEDBUG.=\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bite of the bedbug is decidedly poisonous to some individuals,\r\nresulting in a slight swelling and disagreeable inflammation. To such\r\npersons the presence of bedbugs is sufficient to cause the greatest\r\nuneasiness, if not to put sleep and rest entirely out of the question.\r\nWith others, however, who are less sensitive, the presence of the bugs\r\nmay not be recognized at all, and, except for the occasional staining\r\nof the linen by a crushed individual, their presence might be entirely\r\noverlooked. The inflammation experienced by sensitive persons seems to\r\nresult chiefly from the puncture of the skin by the sharp piercing setæ\r\nwhich constitute the puncturing element of the mouth parts, as there seems\r\nto be no secretion of poison other than the natural fluids of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe biting organ of the bedbug is similar to that of other insects of its\r\norder. It consists of a rather heavy, fleshy under lip (the only part\r\nordinarily seen in examining the insect), within which lie four threadlike\r\nhard filaments or setæ which glide over one another with an alternating\r\nmotion and pierce the flesh. The blood is drawn up through the beak, which\r\nis closely applied to the point of puncture, and the alternating motion of\r\nthe setæ in the flesh causes the blood to flow more freely. The details of\r\nthe structure of the beak are shown in figure 1 at _d_.\r\n\r\nTo allay the irritation set up by the bite of the bedbug, peroxide of\r\nhydrogen, or dioxygen, may be used with good results.\r\n\r\nTincture of iodine either at ordinary or double strength is also a good\r\ncounter-irritant for use in cases of flea, mosquito, bedbug, and other\r\ninsect bites, but should be used with caution on the tender skin of\r\nsmall children and on those who are affected with or disposed to eczemic\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE BEDBUG AND HUMAN DISEASES.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIn common with other insects which attack man and warm-blooded animals,\r\nit is entirely possible for the bedbug and its close allies to be\r\ntransmitters of contagious human diseases, and already these insects have\r\nbeen shown to be possible carriers or transmitters of a considerable\r\nseries of diseases, including infantile Kala-azar of northern Africa and\r\nsouthern Europe, relapsing fever of Africa and Europe, the Chagas fever\r\nof Brazil, tropical sore, plague, and possibly leprosy. In the case of\r\nthese, and perhaps other diseases, the bedbug shares the responsibility of\r\ntransmitter with other biting insects, such as body lice and fleas.\r\n\r\nThe particular role of the bedbug as a carrier of disease has not been\r\nsatisfactorily determined, nor has it been shown that the bedbug is a\r\nnecessary alternate host in any instance. In general, the transmission\r\nof disease by this insect has apparently resulted from the accidental\r\ncarriage of the disease elements on the mouth parts, as pointed out by\r\nAndré,[11] after a careful study of the subject. As a parasite of human\r\nbeings in private dwelling houses, where it may seldom change its host,\r\nthe opportunity for the bedbug itself to become infected with human\r\ndiseases and again to transmit them to the human subject is very remote.\r\nThis condition, however, does not apply to hotels or to passenger boats,\r\nwhere the human occupants are constantly changing. Furthermore, the fact\r\nthat the bedbug attacks its host at comparatively long intervals of from\r\na week to several weeks or months acts as a bar to its transmission of\r\ncertain insect-borne diseases, the biology of which requires a definite\r\nand comparatively short period of development in the alternate insect host.\r\n\r\n[11] André, Ch.

One such instance is reported by the late Mr. Theodore\r\nPergande, of this department, who states that as a soldier in the Civil\r\nWar he occupied at one time a barracks at Meridian, Miss., which had\r\nbeen abandoned some time before. The premises proved to be swarming with\r\nbedbugs; but very shortly afterwards the little red house ant discovered\r\nthe presence of the bedbugs and came in enormous numbers, and Mr. Pergande\r\nwitnessed the very interesting and pleasing sight of the bedbugs being\r\ndismembered and carried away bodily by these very minute ants, many times\r\nsmaller than the bugs which they were handling so successfully. The result\r\nwas that in a single day the bedbug nuisance was completely abated. The\r\nliking of red ants for bedbugs is confirmed also by a correspondent\r\nwriting from Florida (F. C. M. Boggess), who goes so far as heartily to\r\nrecommend the artificial introduction of the ants to abate this bug\r\nnuisance.[14] Bedbugs and other household insects, however, are not of the\r\nsort which it is convenient or profitable to turn over to their natural\r\nenemies in the hope that eradication by this means will follow, and the\r\nfact that they are preyed upon by other insects furnishes no excuse to the\r\nhousekeeper for not instituting prompt remedial measures.\r\n\r\n[12] _Scutigera forceps_ Raf.\r\n\r\n[13] _Monomorium pharaonis_ L.\r\n\r\n[14] Bedbugs and red ants, _In_ Insect Life, v. 6, no. 4, p. 340. 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=REMEDIES.=\r\n\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the most efficient remedy for the bedbug is to fumigate the\r\ninfested house or rooms with hydrocyanic-acid gas. This gas will penetrate\r\ninto every crevice in the house or room where the bedbugs conceal\r\nthemselves and has an immediate effectiveness which gives it an important\r\nrecommendation, especially when the infestation is considerable or of long\r\nstanding. This method of fumigation should be intelligently employed,\r\nas the gas is deadly poisonous. A bulletin giving directions for such\r\nfumigation has been issued by the Department of Agriculture.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] Howard, L. O., and Popenoe, C. H. Hydrocyanic-acid gas against\r\nhousehold insects. U. S. Dept. Agr. Farmers' Bul. 699. 8 p. 1916.\r\n\r\nThe fumes of burning sulphur are also a very efficient means of control\r\nwhere the conditions are such that this method can be used, readily\r\ndestroying the insect in all stages, including the egg. The treatment is\r\ninexpensive compared with the use of hydrocyanic-acid gas and offers much\r\nless risk of danger to human beings. There is, however, a considerable\r\nrisk of injury to household fabrics, furnishings, and wall papers from the\r\nstrong bleaching quality of sulphur fumes. This danger will be somewhat\r\ndiminished if the fumigation can be done at a time when the room or house\r\nis thoroughly dried out, as in winter by a furnace or other heating\r\nsystem. Further precautions should be taken by removing all metallic\r\nsurfaces from the room or building, or by protecting them with a coating\r\nof vaseline. Two pounds of sulphur are recommended for each 2,000 cubic\r\nfeet of space, and the building should be closed for the treatment for at\r\nleast 5 or 6 hours, or preferably for 24 hours. Sulphur candles may be\r\nused where available, or the sulphurous gas or fumes can be generated by\r\nburning the sulphur in a dish placed in the center of the room, and for\r\nprotection set within a larger vessel. Thorough-going precautions must be\r\ntaken to prevent accidental overflowing or the starting of a fire, and\r\nafter the fumigation the house should be given a thorough airing.\r\n\r\nOther gases have been experimented with, such as formalin and the vapors\r\nof benzine, naphthaline, and camphor, but these gases are of little value.\r\nSimilarly, insect powders are of little value, largely from the difficulty\r\nof getting them into the crevices and other places of concealment of the\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nWhere the use of poisonous gas is difficult or objectionable, especially\r\nif only one room is infested, the pests may be eliminated by the\r\napplication of kerosene, benzene, or any of the lighter petroleum oils,\r\nby means of a small hand sprayer. The liquid should be directed at\r\nclose range into all cracks and crevices in the walls and behind loose\r\nwall paper. Open spaces back of baseboards and picture moldings should\r\nbe liberally treated. The bedstead and springs should receive the same\r\nattention, care being taken to spray the liquid into all crevices. The\r\nmattress should likewise be carefully gone over. All seams and spaces\r\nbeneath tuftings should be thoroughly dosed. At the expiration of 10 days\r\nthe entire treatment should be repeated with the same care, regardless of\r\nwhether any bugs are seen or not. If the two applications are made with\r\npainstaking care this should be sufficient for complete eradication.\r\n\r\n_Temperature control._--The possibility of temperature control is\r\nindicated in the discussion elsewhere of the effect of temperature on\r\nthis insect. A temperature maintained below freezing for 10 or 15 days\r\ndestroys the eggs, and this temperature continued for 15 days to a\r\nmonth will destroy the newly hatched young. It may be, therefore, that\r\nif infested houses in cold climates should be opened up and allowed to\r\nremain at a temperature well below freezing for a considerable period, all\r\neggs and the young, and possibly most if not all of the adults, would be\r\nexterminated. This method of control might perhaps be practicable at least\r\nin the case of summer houses in the north which are left untenanted in the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe maintaining of high temperatures may be an even more efficient method\r\nof control. The activity of the bedbug is at its greatest between 60° and\r\n70° to 75°. As indicated elsewhere, in a temperature of 96° to 100° F.,\r\naccompanied with a high degree of humidity, newly hatched bedbugs perish\r\nwithin a few days, and, if this temperature is raised to 113° F., in a few\r\nminutes. A temperature of 113° will also destroy the eggs, and with these\r\nhigher temperatures the item of humidity is not apparently important.\r\n\r\nA very practical test of this method of control was made in Ontario,\r\nCanada, by the Dominion Entomological Department,[16] adapting the\r\nmethod of control of insects infesting granaries and flour mills by\r\nsuperheating. In this instance an eight-room, two-story frame house, badly\r\ninfested with bedbugs, was during the month of July brought to a very\r\nhigh degree of heat by making up good fires in the heating furnace and\r\nother stoves in the house and closing up the house to retain the heat.\r\nRecording thermometers placed in different rooms indicated a gradual\r\nrise of temperature from 77° to 160° during the period from 9.30 in the\r\nmorning to 7.30 in the evening, the outside temperatures during the same\r\nperiod ranging from 64° to 73° F. At 1.30, when the temperature in the\r\ndifferent rooms ranged from 109° to 130°, many adults and immature forms\r\nhad already succumbed. By 4.30 the temperature was ranging from 127° to\r\n148° in different rooms, and all the insects were dead. The continuation\r\nof the experiment was on the supposition that it would probably require\r\na higher degree of temperature to destroy the eggs. The eradication of\r\nthe bedbug from this house was complete, and no damage was done to the\r\nhouse or its contents. That the temperatures ranged much higher than\r\nwas necessary is indicated by the temperature experiments referred to\r\nelsewhere, which indicated that the eggs as well as larvæ are destroyed\r\nwithin a few minutes at a temperature of 113° F. The latter temperature\r\nwas also sufficient to destroy quickly the adults of fleas, cockroaches,\r\nand other insects. It would seem, therefore, that superheating of houses\r\nin midsummer to a temperature of 120° to 130° F. may prove to be one of\r\nthe simplest and most effective means of eradication of this and perhaps\r\nother household pests.\r\n\r\n[16] Ross, W.
