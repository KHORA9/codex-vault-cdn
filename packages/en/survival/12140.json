Subsequently, when it appeared that\r\nthere was then no readily available English version of the Roman\r\nagronomists, this translation was made, in the spirit of old Piero\r\nVettori, the kindly Florentine scholar, whose portrait was painted by\r\nTitian and whose monument may still be seen in the Church of Santo\r\nSpirito: in the preface of his edition of Varro he says that he\r\nundertook the work, not for the purpose of displaying his learning,\r\nbut to aid others in the study of an excellent author. Victorius was\r\njustified by his scholarship and the present editor has no such\r\nclaim to attention: he, therefore, makes the confession frankly (to\r\nanticipate perhaps such criticism as Bentley's \"a very pretty poem,\r\nMr. Pope, but don't call it Homer\") and offers the little book to\r\nthose who love the country, and to read about the country amidst the\r\ncrowded life of towns, with the hope that they may find in it some\r\nmeasure of the pleasure it has afforded the editor.\r\n\r\nThe texts and commentaries used have been those of Schneider and Keil,\r\nthe latter more accurate but the former more sympathetic.\r\n\r\nF.H.

As, however,\r\nhe is neither ashamed of the book nor essays the _rôle_ of\r\n\r\n  A violet by a mossy stone\r\n  Half hidden from the eye,\r\n\r\nhe now and here signs his name.\r\n\r\nFAIRFAX HARRISON.\r\n\r\nBELVOIR HOUSE,\r\nChristmas, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nNOTE UPON THE ROMAN AGRONOMISTS\r\nNOTE ON THE OBLIGATION OF VIRGIL TO VARRO\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCATO'S _DE AGRICULTURA_\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction: Of the Dignity of the Farmer\r\nOf Buying a Farm\r\nOf the Duties of the Owner\r\nOf Laying out the Farm\r\nOf Stocking the Farm\r\nOf the Duties of the Overseer\r\nOf the Duties of the Housekeeper\r\nOf the Hands\r\nOf Draining\r\nOf Preparing the Seed Bed\r\nOf Manure\r\nOf Soil Improvement\r\nOf Forage Crops\r\nOf Planting\r\nOf Pastures\r\nOf Feeding Live Stock\r\nOf the Care of Live Stock\r\nOf Cakes and Salad\r\nOf Curing Hams\r\n\r\n\r\nVARRO'S _RERUM RUSTICARUM LIBRI TRES_\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nTHE HUSBANDRY OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nI.

Nam\r\n    multo plura reperiuntur, apud veteres, quae nobis probanda sint,\r\n    quam quae repudianda.\r\n\r\n    COLUMELLA I, I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of the Roman treatises on farm management is profitable to\r\nthe modern farmer however practical and scientific he may be. He will\r\nnot find in them any thing about bacteria and the \"nodular hypothesis\"\r\nin respect of legumes, nor any thing about plant metabolism, nor even\r\nany thing about the effects of creatinine on growth and absorption;\r\nbut, important and fascinating as are the illuminations of modern\r\nscience upon practical agriculture, the intelligent farmer with\r\nimagination (every successful farmer has imagination, whether or not\r\nhe is intelligent) will find some thing quite as important to his\r\nwelfare in the body of Roman husbandry which has come down to us,\r\nnamely: a background for his daily routine, an appreciation that two\r\nthousand years ago men were studying the same problems and solving\r\nthem by intelligent reasoning. Columella well says that in reading\r\nthe ancient writers we may find in them more to approve than to\r\ndisapprove, however much our new science may lead us to differ from\r\nthem in practice. The characteristics of the Roman methods of farm\r\nmanagement, viewed in the light of the present state of the art in\r\nAmerica, were thoroughness and patience. The Romans had learned many\r\nthings which we are now learning again, such as green manuring with\r\nlegumes, soiling, seed selection, the testing of soil for sourness,\r\nintensive cultivation of a fallow as well as of a crop, conservative\r\nrotation, the importance of live stock in a system of general farming,\r\nthe preservation of the chemical content of manure and the composting\r\nof the rubbish of a farm, but they brought to their farming operations\r\nsome thing more which we have not altogether learned--the character\r\nwhich made them a people of enduring achievement. Varro quotes one of\r\ntheir proverbs \"Romanus sedendo vincit,\" which illustrates my present\r\npoint. The Romans achieved their results by thoroughness and patience.\r\nIt was thus that they defeated Hannibal and it was thus that they\r\nbuilt their farm houses and fences, cultivated their fields, their\r\nvineyards and their oliveyards, and bred and fed their live stock.\r\nThey seem to have realized that there are no short cuts in the\r\nprocesses of nature, and that the law of compensations is invariable.\r\nThe foundation of their agriculture was the fallow[1] and one finds\r\nthem constantly using it as a simile--in the advice not to breed a\r\nmare every year, as in that not to exact too much tribute from a bee\r\nhive. Ovid even warns a lover to allow fallow seasons to intervene in\r\nhis courtship.\r\n\r\nWhile one can find instruction in their practice even today, one\r\ncan benefit even more from their agricultural philosophy, for the\r\ncharacteristic of the American farmer is that he is in too much of a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nThe ancient literature of farm management was voluminous. Varro cites\r\nfifty Greek authors on the subject whose works he knew, beginning with\r\nHesiod and Xenophon. Mago of Carthage wrote a treatise in the Punic\r\ntongue which was so highly esteemed that the Roman Senate ordered it\r\ntranslated into Latin, but, like most of the Greeks,[2] it is now lost\r\nto us except in the literary tradition.\r\n\r\nColumella says that it was Cato who taught Agriculture to speak Latin.\r\nCato's book, written in the middle of the second century B. C, was the\r\nfirst on the subject in Latin; indeed, it was one of the very first\r\nbooks written in that vernacular at all. Of the other Latin writers\r\nwhose bucolic works have survived, Varro and Virgil wrote at the\r\nbeginning of the Augustan Age and were followed by the Spanish\r\nColumella under Tiberius, and by Pliny (with his Natural History)\r\nunder Titus. After them (and \"a long way after,\" as Mr. Punch says)\r\ncame in the fourth century the worthy but dull Palladius, who supplied\r\nthe hornbook used by the agricultural monks throughout the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nMARCUS PORCIUS CATO (B.C. 234-149), known in history as the elder\r\nCato, was the type of Roman produced by the most vigorous days of\r\nthe Republic. Born at Tusculum on the narrow acres which his peasant\r\nforefathers had tilled in the intervals of military service, he\r\ncommenced advocate at the country assizes, followed his fortunes to\r\nRome and there became a leader of the metropolitan bar. He saw gallant\r\nmilitary service in Spain and in Greece, commanded an army, held all\r\nthe curule offices of state and ended a contentious life in the Senate\r\ndenouncing Carthage and the degeneracy of the times.\r\n\r\nHe was an upstanding man, but as coarse as he was vigorous in mind and\r\nin body. Roman literature is full of anecdotes about him and his wise\r\nand witty sayings.\r\n\r\nUnlike many men who have devoted a toilsome youth to agricultural\r\nlabour, when he attained fame and fortune he maintained his interest\r\nin his farm, and wrote his _De re rustica_ in green old age. It tells\r\nwhat sort of farm manager he himself was, or wanted to be thought to\r\nbe, and, though a mere collection of random notes, sets forth more\r\nshrewd common sense and agricultural experience than it is possible to\r\npack into the same number of English words. It remains today of much\r\nmore than antiquarian interest.\r\n\r\nMARCUS TERENTIUS VARRO (B.C. 116-28) whom Quintilian called \"the most\r\nlearned of the Romans,\" and Petrarch \"il terzo gran lume Romano,\"\r\nranking him with Cicero and Virgil, probably studied agriculture\r\nbefore he studied any thing else, for he was born on a Sabine farm,\r\nand although of a well to do family, was bred in the habits of\r\nsimplicity and rural industry with which the poets have made that\r\nname synonymous. All his life he amused the leisure snatched from his\r\nstudies with intelligent supervision of the farming of his several\r\nestates: and he wrote his treatise _Rerum Rusticarum_ in his eightieth\r\nyear.[3]\r\n\r\nHe had his share of active life, but it was as a scholar that he\r\ndistinguished himself.[4] Belonging to the aristocratic party, he\r\nbecame a friend and supporter of Pompey, and, after holding a naval\r\ncommand under him in the war against the Pirates in B.C. 67, was\r\nhis legatus in Spain at the beginning of the civil wars and there\r\nsurrendered to Caesar. He was again on the losing side at the battle\r\nof Pharsalia, but was pardoned by Caesar, who selected him to be\r\nlibrarian of the public library he proposed to establish at Rome.[5]\r\nFrom this time Varro eschewed politics and devoted himself to letters,\r\nalthough his troubles were not yet at an end: after the death of\r\nCaesar, the ruthless Antony despoiled his villa at Casinum (where\r\nVarro had built the aviary described in book Three), and like Cicero\r\nhe was included in the proscriptions which followed the compact of the\r\ntriumvirs, but in the end unlike Cicero he escaped and spent his last\r\nyears peacefully at his villas at Cumae and Tusculum.\r\n\r\nHis literary activity was astonishing: he wrote at least six hundred\r\nbooks covering a wide range of antiquarian research. St. Augustine,\r\nwho dearly loved to turn a balanced phrase, says that Varro had read\r\nso much that it is difficult to understand when he found time to\r\nwrite, while on the other hand he wrote so much that one can scarcely\r\nread all his books. Cicero, who claimed him as an intimate friend,\r\ndescribes (_Acad_. Ill) what Varro had written before B.C. 46, but he\r\nwent on producing to the end of his long life, eighteen years later:\r\n\"For,\" says Cicero, \"while we are sojourners, so to speak, in our own\r\ncity and wandering about like strangers, your books have conducted us,\r\nas it were, home again, so as to enable us at last to recognize who\r\nand whence we are. You have discussed the antiquities of our country\r\nand the variety of dates and chronology relating to it. You have\r\nexplained the laws which regulate sacrifices and priests: you have\r\nunfolded the customs of the city both in war and peace: you have\r\ndescribed the various quarters and districts: you have omitted\r\nmentioning none of the names, or kinds, or functions, or causes of\r\ndivine or human things: you have thrown a flood of light on our poets\r\nand altogether on Latin literature and the Latin language: you have\r\nyourself composed a poem of varied beauties and elegant in almost\r\nevery part: and you have in many places touched upon philosophy in\r\na manner sufficient to excite our curiosity, though inadequate to\r\ninstruct us.\"\r\n\r\nOf Varro's works, beside the _Rerum Rusticarum_, there have survived\r\nonly fragments, including a considerable portion of the treatise\r\non the Latin language: the story is that most of his books were\r\ndeliberately destroyed at the procurement of the Church (something\r\nnot impossible, as witness the Emperor Theodosius in _Corpus Juris\r\nCivilis_. Cod. Lib. I, tit. I, cap. 3, § I) to conceal St. Augustine's\r\nplagiarism from them; yet the _De Civitate Dei_, which is largely\r\ndevoted to refuting Varro's pagan theology, is a perennial monument to\r\nhis fame. St. Augustine says (VI, 2): \"Although his elocution has less\r\ncharm, he is so full of learning and philosophy that ... he instructs\r\nthe student of facts as much as Cicero delights the student of style.\"\r\n\r\nVarro's treatise on farm management is the best practical book on\r\nthe subject which has come down to us from antiquity. It has not the\r\nspontaneous originality of Cato, nor the detail and suave elegance of\r\nColumella. Walter Harte in his _Essays on Husbandry_ (1764) says\r\nthat Cato writes like an English squire and Varro like a French\r\nacademician. This is just comment on Cato but it is at once too much\r\nand too little to say of Varro: a French academician might be proud\r\nof his antiquarian learning, but would balk at his awkward and homely\r\nLatin, as indeed one French academician, M. Boissier, has since done.\r\nThe real merit of Varro's book is that it is the well digested system\r\nof an experienced and successful farmer who has seen and practised all\r\nthat he records.\r\n\r\nThe authority from which Virgil drew the practical farming lore, for\r\nwhich he has been extolled in all ages, was Varro: indeed, as a farm\r\nmanual the _Georgics_ go astray only when they depart from Varro. It\r\nis worth while to elaborate this point, which Professor Sellar, in his\r\nargument for the originality of Virgil, only suggests.[6]\r\n\r\nAfter Philippi the times were ripe for books on agriculture. The Roman\r\nworld had been divided between Octavian and Antony and there was peace\r\nin Italy: men were turning \"back to the land.\"\r\n\r\nAn agricultural regeneration of Italy was impending, chiefly in\r\nviticulture, as Ferrero has pointed out. With far sighted appreciation\r\nof the economic advantages of this, Octavian determined to promote the\r\nmovement, which became one of the completed glories of the Augustan\r\nAge, when Horace sang\r\n\r\n    Tua, Caesar, aetas\r\n  Fruges et agris rettulit uberes.\r\n\r\nVarro's book appeared in B.C. 37 and during that year Maecenas\r\ncommissioned Virgil to put into verse the spirit of the times; just\r\nas, under similar circumstances, Cromwell pensioned Samuel Hartlib.\r\nSuch is the co-incidence of the dates that it is not impossible that\r\nthe _Rerum Rusticarum_ suggested the subject of the _Georgics_, either\r\nto Virgil or to Maecenas.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in the _Bucolics_ that Virgil ever had any\r\npractical knowledge of agriculture before he undertook to write the\r\n_Georgics_. His father was, it is true, a farmer, but apparently in a\r\nsmall way and unsuccessful, for he had to eke out a frugal livelihood\r\nby keeping bees and serving as the hireling deputy of a _viator_ or\r\nconstable. This type of farmer persists and may be recognized in any\r\nrural community: but the agricultural colleges do not enlist such\r\nmen into their faculties. So it is possible that Virgil owed little\r\nagricultural knowledge to his father's precepts or example. Virgil\r\nperhaps had tended his father's flock, as he pictures himself doing\r\nunder the guise of Tityrus; certainly he spent many hours of youth\r\n\"patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi\" steeping his Celtic soul with the\r\nbeauty and the melancholy poetry of the Lombard landscape: and so he\r\ncame to know and to love bird and flower and the external aspects of\r\n\r\n    wheat and woodland\r\n  tilth and vineyard, hive and horse and herd,\r\n\r\nbut it does not appear that he ever followed the plough, or, what is\r\nmore important, ever laid off a ploughgate. As a poet of nature no one\r\nwas ever better equipped (the highest testimony is that of Tennyson),\r\nbut when it came to writing poetry around the art of farm management\r\nit was necessary for him to turn to books for his facts. He\r\nacknowledges (_Geo_. I, 176) his obligation only to _veterum\r\npraecepta_ without naming them, but as M. Gaston Boissier says he was\r\nevidently referring to Varro \"le plus moderne de tous les anciens.\"[7]\r\nVirgil evidently regarded Varro's treatise as a solid foundation for\r\nhis poem and he used it freely, just as he drew on Hesiod for literary\r\ninspiration, on Lucretius for imaginative philosophy, and on Mago and\r\nCato and the two Sasernas for local colour.\r\n\r\nVirgil probably had also the advantage of personal contact with Varro\r\nduring the seven years he was composing and polishing the _Georgics_.\r\nHe spent them largely at Naples (_Geo_. IV, 563) and Varro was then\r\nestablished in retirement at Cumae: thus they were neighbours, and,\r\nalthough they belonged to different political parties, the young poet\r\nmust have known and visited the old polymath; there was every\r\nreason for him to have taken advantage of the opportunity. Whatever\r\njustification there may be for this conjecture, the fact remains that\r\nVarro is in the background every where throughout the _Georgics_, as\r\nthe \"deadly parallel\" in the appended note will indicate. This is\r\nperhaps the most interesting thing about Varro's treatise: instructive\r\nand entertaining as it is to the farmer, in the large sense of the\r\neffect of literature on mankind, Virgil gave it wings--the useful cart\r\nhorse became Pegasus.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the chorus of praise of the _Georgics_, there have\r\nbeen those, in all ages, who have sneered at Virgil's farming. The\r\nfirst such _advocatus diaboli_ was Seneca, who, writing to Lucilius\r\n(_Ep_. 86) from the farm house of Scipio Africanus, fell foul of the\r\nadvice (_Geo_, I, 216) to plant both beans and millet in the spring,\r\nsaying that he had just seen at the end of June beans gathered and\r\nmillet sowed on the same day: from which he generalized that Virgil\r\ndisregarded the truth to turn a graceful verse, and sought rather to\r\ndelight his reader than to instruct the husbandman. This kind of\r\ncheap criticism does not increase our respect for Nero's philosophic\r\nminister.[8] Whatever may have been Virgil's mistakes, every farmer\r\nof sentiment should thank God that one of the greatest poems in any\r\nlanguage contains as much as it does of a sound tradition of the\r\npractical side of his art, and here is where Varro is entitled to the\r\nappreciation which is always due the schoolmaster of a genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE ON THE OBLIGATION OF VIRGIL TO VARRO\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the first _Georgic_ (1-5) Virgil lays out the\r\nscope of the poem as dealing with three subjects, agriculture, the\r\ncare of live stock and the husbandry of bees. This was Varro's plan\r\n(R.R. I, I, 2, and I, 2 passim) except that under the third head Varro\r\nincluded, with bees, all the other kinds of stock which were usually\r\nkept at a Roman steading. Varro asserts that his was the first\r\nscientific classification of the subject ever made. Virgil (G. I,\r\n5-13) begins too with the invocation of the Sun and the Moon and\r\ncertain rural deities, as did Varro (R.R. I, I, 4). The passages\r\nshould be compared for, as M. Gaston Boissier has pointed out, the\r\ndifference in the point of view of the two men is here illustrated\r\nby the fact that Varro appeals to purely Roman deities, while Virgil\r\ninvokes the literary gods of Greece. Following the _Georgics_ through,\r\none who has studied Varro will note other passages for which a\r\nsuggestion may be found in Varro, usually in facts, but some times\r\nin thought and even in words, viz: Before beginning his agricultural\r\noperations a farmer should study the character of the country (G. I,\r\n50: R.R. I, 6), the prevailing winds and the climate (G. I, 51: R.R.\r\nI, 2, 3), the farming practice of the neighbourhood (G. I, 52: R.R. I,\r\n18, 7), \"this land is fit for corn, that for vines, and the other\r\nfor trees,\" (G. I, 54: R.R. I, 6, 5). He should practise fallow\r\nand rotation (G. I, 71: R.R. I, 44, 2), and compensate the land by\r\nplanting legumes (G. I, 74: R.R. I, 23); he should irrigate his\r\nmeadows in summer (G. I, 104: R.R. I, 31, 5), and drain off surface\r\nwater in winter (G. I, 113: R.R. I, 36). Man has progressed from\r\na primitive state, when he subsisted on nuts and berries, to the\r\ndomestication of animals and to agriculture (G. I, 121-159: R.R. II,\r\n1, 3). The threshing floor must be protected from pests (G. I, 178:\r\nR.R. I, 51). Seed should be carefully selected (G. I, 197: R.R. 40,\r\n2); the time for sowing grain is the autumn (G. I, 219: R.R.

For our ancestors\r\nconsidered, and so ordained in their laws, that, while the thief\r\nshould be cast in double damages, the usurer should make four-fold\r\nrestitution. From this we may judge how much less desirable a citizen\r\nthey esteemed the banker than the thief. When they sought to commend\r\nan honest man, they termed him good husbandman, good farmer. This they\r\nrated the superlative of praise.[9] Personally, I think highly of a\r\nman actively and diligently engaged in commerce, who seeks thereby to\r\nmake his fortune, yet, as I have said, his career is full of risks and\r\npitfalls. But it is from the tillers of the soil that spring the best\r\ncitizens, the stanchest soldiers; and theirs are the enduring rewards\r\nwhich are most grateful and least envied. Such as devote themselves to\r\nthat pursuit are least of all men given to evil counsels.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to get to my subject, these observations will serve as\r\npreface to what I have promised to discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of buying a farm_\r\n\r\n(I)[10] When you have decided to purchase a farm, be careful not to buy\r\nrashly; do not spare your visits and be not content with a single tour\r\nof inspection. The more you go, the more will the place please you,\r\nif it be worth your attention. Give heed to the appearance of the\r\nneighbourhood,--a flourishing country should show its prosperity.\r\n\"When you go in, look about, so that, when needs be, you can find your\r\nway out.\"\r\n\r\nTake care that you choose a good climate, not subject to destructive\r\nstorms, and a soil that is naturally strong. If possible, your farm\r\nshould be at the foot of a mountain, looking to the South, in a\r\nhealthy situation, where labour and cattle can be had, well watered,\r\nnear a good sized town, and either on the sea or a navigable river, or\r\nelse on a good and much frequented road. Choose a place which has\r\nnot often changed ownership, one which is sold unwillingly, that has\r\nbuildings in good repair.\r\n\r\nBeware that you do not rashly contemn the experience of others. It\r\nis better to buy from a man who has farmed successfully and built\r\nwell.[11]\r\n\r\nWhen you inspect the farm, look to see how many wine presses and\r\nstorage vats there are; where there are none of these you can judge\r\nwhat the harvest is. On the other hand, it is not the number of\r\nfarming implements, but what is done with them, that counts. Where you\r\nfind few tools, it is not an expensive farm to operate. Know that with\r\na farm, as with a man, however productive it may be, if it has the\r\nspending habit, not much will be left over.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the duties of the owner._\r\n\r\n(II) When you have arrived at your country house and have saluted your\r\nhousehold, you should make the rounds of the farm the same day, if\r\npossible; if not, then certainly the next day. When you have observed\r\nhow the field work has progressed,[13] what things have been done, and\r\nwhat remains undone, you should summon your overseer the next day, and\r\nshould call for a report of what work has been done in good season and\r\nwhy it has not been possible to complete the rest, and what wine and\r\ncorn and other crops have been gathered. When you are advised on these\r\npoints you should make your own calculation of the time necessary\r\nfor the work, if there does not appear to you to have been enough\r\naccomplished. The overseer will report that he himself has worked\r\ndiligently, but that some slaves have been sick and others truant,\r\nthe weather has been bad, and that it has been necessary to work the\r\npublic roads. When he has given these and many other excuses, you\r\nshould recall to his attention the program of work which you had\r\nlaid out for him on your last visit and compare it with the results\r\nattained. If the weather has been bad, count how many stormy days\r\nthere have been, and rehearse what work could have been done despite\r\nthe rain, such as washing and pitching the wine vats, cleaning out\r\nthe barns, sorting the grain, hauling out and composting the manure,\r\ncleaning seed, mending the old gear, and making new, mending the\r\nsmocks and hoods furnished for the hands. On feast days the old\r\nditches should be mended, the public roads worked, briers cut down,\r\nthe garden dug, the meadow cleaned, the hedges trimmed and the\r\nclippings collected and burned, the fish pond cleaned out. On such\r\ndays, furthermore, the slaves' rations should be cut down as compared\r\nwith what is allowed when they are working in the fields in fine\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWhen this routine has been discussed quietly and with good humour and\r\nis thoroughly understood by the overseer, you should give orders for\r\nthe completion of the work which has been neglected.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of money, supplies and provisions should then be\r\nconsidered. The overseer should report what wine and oil has been\r\nsold, what price he got, what is on hand, and what remains for sale.\r\nSecurity should be taken for such accounts as ought to be secured. All\r\nother unsettled matters should be agreed upon. If any thing is needed\r\nfor the coming year, it should be bought; every thing which is not\r\nneeded should be sold. Whatever there is for lease should be leased.\r\nOrders should be given (and take care that they are in writing) for\r\nall work which next it is desired to have done on the farm or let to\r\ncontract. You should go over the cattle and determine what is to be\r\nsold. You should sell the oil, if you can get your price, the surplus\r\nwine and corn, the old cattle, the worn out oxen, and the cull sheep,\r\nthe wool and the hides, the old and sick slaves, and if any thing else\r\nis superfluous you should sell that. The appetite of the good farmer\r\nis to sell, not to buy.[14]\r\n\r\n(IV) Be a good neighbour. Do not roughly give offence to your own\r\npeople. If the neighbourhood regards you kindly, you will find a\r\nreadier market for what you have to sell, you will more easily get\r\nyour work done, either on the place or by contract. If you build, your\r\nneighbours will aid you with their services, their cattle and their\r\nmaterials. If any misfortune should overtake you (which God forbid!)\r\nthey will protect you with kindly interest.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of laying out the farm_\r\n\r\n(I) If you ask me what is the best disposition to make of your estate,\r\nI would say that should you have bought a farm of one hundred _jugera_\r\n(about 66 acres) all told,[16] in the best situation, it should be\r\nplanted as follows: 1° a vineyard, if it promises a good yield, 2° an\r\nirrigated garden, 3° an osier bed, 4° an olive yard, 5° a meadow, 6°\r\na corn field, 7° a wood lot, 8° a cultivated orchard, and 9° a mast\r\ngrove[17].\r\n\r\n(III) In his youth, the farmer ought, diligently to plant his land,\r\nbut he should ponder before he builds. Planting does not require\r\nreflection, but demands action. It is time enough to build when you\r\nhave reached your thirty-sixth year, if you have farmed your land well\r\nmeanwhile. When you do build, let your buildings be proportioned to\r\nyour estate, and your estate to your buildings[18]. It is fitting that\r\nthe farm buildings should be well constructed, that you should have\r\nample oil cellars and wine vats, and a good supply of casks, so that\r\nyou can wait for high prices, something which will redound to your\r\nhonour, your profit and your self-respect.\r\n\r\n(IV) Build your dwelling house in accordance with your means. If you\r\nbuild well in a good situation and on a good property, and furnish the\r\nhouse suitably for country life, you will come there more often and\r\nmore willingly[19]. The farm will then be better, fewer mistakes will\r\nbe made, and you will get larger crops. The face of the master is good\r\nfor the land.[20]\r\n\r\n(VI) Plant elm trees along the roads and fence rows, so that you may\r\nhave the leaves to feed the sheep and cattle, and the timber will be\r\navailable if you need it. If any where there are banks of streams or\r\nwet places, there plant reeds; and surround them with willows that the\r\nosiers may serve to tie the vines.\r\n\r\n(VII) It is most convenient to set out the land nearest the house as\r\nan orchard, whence fire wood and faggots may be sold and the supply of\r\nthe master obtained. In this enclosure should be planted every thing\r\nfitting to the land and vines should be married to the trees.[21]\r\n\r\n(VIII) Near the house lay out also a garden with garland flowers and\r\nvegetables[22] of all kinds, and set it about with myrtle hedges, both\r\nwhite and black, as well as Delphic and Cyprian laurel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of stocking the farm_\r\n\r\n(X) An olive farm of two hundred and forty _jugera_ (160 acres) ought\r\nto be stocked as follows: an overseer, a house keeper, five labourers,\r\nthree ox drivers, one swineherd, one ass driver, one shepherd; in all\r\nthirteen hands: three pair of oxen,[23] three asses with pack saddles,\r\nto haul out the manure, one other ass to turn the mill, and one\r\nhundred sheep.[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the duties of the overseer._[25]\r\n\r\n(V) These are the duties of the overseer: He should maintain\r\ndiscipline. He should observe the feast days. He should respect the\r\nrights of others and steadfastly uphold his own. He should settle all\r\nquarrels among the hands; if any one is at fault he should administer\r\nthe punishment. He should take care that no one on the place is in\r\nwant, or lacks food or drink; in this respect he can afford to\r\nbe generous, for he will thus more easily prevent picking and\r\nstealing.[26]\r\n\r\nUnless the overseer is of evil mind, he will himself do no wrong, but\r\nif he permits wrong-doing by others, the master should not suffer\r\nsuch indulgence to pass with impunity. He should show appreciation of\r\ncourtesy, to encourage others to practise it. He should not be given\r\nto gadding or conviviality, but should be always sober. He should\r\nkeep the hands busy, and should see that they do what the master has\r\nordered. He should not think that he knows more than his master. The\r\nfriends of the master should be his friends, and he should give heed\r\nto those whom the master has recommended to him. He should confine his\r\nreligious practices to church on Sunday, or to his own house.[27]\r\n\r\nHe should lend money to no man unbidden by the master, but what the\r\nmaster has lent he should collect. He should never lend any seed\r\nreserved for sowing, feed, corn, wine, or oil, but he should have\r\nrelations with two or three other farms with which he can exchange\r\nthings needed in emergency. He should state his accounts with his\r\nmaster frequently. He should not keep any hired men or day hands\r\nlonger than is necessary. He should not sell any thing without the\r\nknowledge of the master, nor should he conceal any thing from the\r\nmaster. He should not have any hangers-on, nor should he consult any\r\nsoothsayer, fortune teller, necromancer, or astrologer. He should not\r\nspare seed in sowing, for that is bad economy. He should strive to be\r\nexpert in all kinds of farm work, and, without exhausting himself,\r\noften lend a hand. By so doing, he will better understand the point of\r\nview of his hands, and they will work more contentedly; moreover, he\r\nwill have less inclination to gad, his health will be better, and he\r\nwill sleep more refreshingly.\r\n\r\nFirst up in the morning, he should be the last to go to bed at night;\r\nand before he does, he should see that the farm gates are closed, and\r\nthat each of the hands is in his own bed, that the stock have been\r\nfed. He should see that the best of care is taken of the oxen, and\r\nshould pay the highest compliments to the teamsters who keep their\r\ncattle in the best condition. He should see to it that the ploughs\r\nand plough shares are kept in good repair. Plan all the work in ample\r\ntime, for so it is with farm work, if one thing is done late, every\r\nthing will be late.\r\n\r\n(XXXIX) When it rains try to find some thing to do indoors. Clean up,\r\nrather than remain idle. Remember that while work may stop, expenses\r\nstill go on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the duties of the housekeeper_\r\n\r\n(CXLIII) The overseer should be responsible for the duties of the\r\nhousekeeper. If the master has given her to you for a wife, you should\r\nbe satisfied with her, and she should respect you. Require that she\r\nbe not given to wasteful habits; that she does not gossip with the\r\nneighbours and other women. She should not receive visitors either in\r\nthe kitchen or in her own quarters. She should not go out to parties,\r\nnor should she gad about.[28] She should not practise religious\r\nobservances, nor should she ask others to do so for her without the\r\npermission of the master or the mistress. Remember that the master\r\npractises religion for the entire household. She should be neat in\r\nappearance and should keep the house swept and garnished. Every night\r\nbefore she goes to bed she should see that the hearth is swept and\r\nclean. On the Kalends, the Ides, the Nones, and on all feast days, she\r\nshould hang a garland over the hearth. On those days also she should\r\npray fervently to the household gods. She should take care that she\r\nhas food cooked for you and for the hands. She should have plenty of\r\nchickens and an abundance of eggs.[29] She should diligently put up all\r\nkinds of preserves every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the hands_\r\n\r\n(LVI) The following are the customary allowances for food: For the\r\nhands, four pecks of meal for the winter, and four and one-half for\r\nthe summer. For the overseer, the housekeeper, the wagoner, the\r\nshepherd, three pecks each. For the slaves, four pounds of bread\r\nfor the winter, but when they begin to cultivate the vines this is\r\nincreased to five pounds until the figs are ripe, then return to four\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n(LVII) The sum of the wine allowed for each hand per annum is eight\r\nquadrantals, or Amphora, but add in the proportion as they do work.\r\nTen quadrantals per annum is not too much to allow them to drink.\r\n\r\n(LVIII) Save the wind fall olives as much as possible as relishes for\r\nthe hands. Later set aside such of the ripe olives as will make the\r\nleast oil. Be careful to make them go as far as possible. When the\r\nolives are all eaten, give them fish pickles and vinegar. One peck of\r\nsalt per annum is enough for each hand.\r\n\r\n(LIX) Allow each hand a smock and a cloak every other year. As often\r\nas you give out a smock or cloak to any one take up the old one, so\r\nthat caps can be made out of it. A pair of heavy wooden shoes should\r\nbe allowed every other year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of draining_\r\n\r\n(XLIII) If the land is wet, it should be drained with trough shaped\r\nditches dug three feet wide at the surface and one foot at the bottom\r\nand four feet deep. Blind these ditches with rock. If you have no rock\r\nthen fill them with green willow poles braced crosswise. If you have\r\nno poles, fill then with faggots. Then dig lateral trenches three feet\r\ndeep and four feet wide in such way that the water will flow from the\r\ntrenches into the ditches.\r\n\r\n(CLV) In the winter surface water should be drained off the fields.\r\nOn hillsides courses should be kept clear for the water to flow off.\r\nDuring the rainy season at the beginning of Autumn is the greatest\r\nrisk from water. When it begins to rain all the hands should go out\r\nwith picks and shovels and clear out the drains so that the water may\r\nflow off into the roads, and the crops be protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of preparing the seed bed_\r\n\r\n(LXI) What is the first principle of good agriculture? To plough well.\r\nWhat is the second? To plough again; and the third is to manure. When\r\nyou plough corn land, plough well and in good weather, lest you turn\r\na cloddy furrow. The other things of good agriculture are to sow seed\r\nplentifully, to thin the young sprouts, and to hill up the roots with\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n(V) Never plough rotten land[30] nor drive flocks or carts across it.\r\n\r\nIf care is not taken about this, the land so abused will be barren for\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of manure_\r\n\r\n(V) Plan to have a big compost heap and take the best of care of the\r\nmanure. When it is hauled out see that it is well rotted and spread.\r\nThe Autumn is the time to do this.\r\n\r\n(XXXVII) You can make manure of litter, lupine straw, chaff, bean\r\nstalks, husks and the leaves of ilex and of oak.[31]\r\n\r\n(XXX) Fold your sheep on the land which you are about to seed, and\r\nthere feed them leaves.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of soil improvement_\r\n\r\n(XXXVII) The things which are harmful to corn land are to plough the\r\nground when it is rotten, and to plant chick peas which are harvested\r\nwith the straw and are salt. Barley, fenugreek and pulse all exhaust\r\ncorn land, as well as all other things which are harvested with the\r\nstraw. Do not plant nut trees in the corn land. On the other hand,\r\nlupines, field beans and vetch manure corn land.[33]\r\n\r\n(VI) Where the soil is rich and fertile, without shade, there the corn\r\nland ought to be. Where the land lies low, plant rape, millet, and\r\npanic grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of forage crops_\r\n\r\n(VIII) If you have a water meadow you will not want forage, but if not\r\nthen sow an upland meadow, so that hay may not be lacking.\r\n\r\n(LIII) Save your hay when the times comes, and beware lest you mow too\r\nlate. Mow before the seed is ripe. House the best hay by itself, so\r\nthat you may feed it to the draft cattle during the spring ploughing,\r\nbefore the clover is mature.\r\n\r\n(XXVII) Sow, for feed for the cattle, clover, vetch, fenugreek, field\r\nbeans and pulse. Sow these crops a second and a third time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of planting_\r\n\r\n(XXXIV) Wherever the land is cold and wet, sow there first, and last\r\nof all in the warmest places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of pastures_\r\n\r\n(L) Manure the pastures in early spring in the dark of the moon, when\r\nthe west wind begins to blow. When you close your pastures (to the\r\nstock) clean them and root out all weeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of feeding live stock_\r\n\r\n(XXX) As long as they are available, feed green leaves of elm, poplar,\r\noak and fig to your cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\n(V) Store leaves, also, to be fed to the sheep before they have\r\nwithered.[34]\r\n\r\n(XXX) Take the best of care of your dry fodder, which you house for\r\nthe winter, and remember always how long the winter may last.\r\n\r\n(IV) Be sure you have well constructed stables furnished with\r\nsubstantial stalls and equipped with latticed feed racks. The\r\nintervals between the bars of the racks should be one foot. If you\r\nbuild them in this way, the cattle will not waste their food.\r\n\r\n(LIV) This is the way that provender should be prepared and fed: When\r\nthe seeding is finished, gather mast and soak it in water. Feed a\r\nmeasure of it every day to each steer; or if they have not been worked\r\nit will be sufficient to let them pasture the mast beds. Another good\r\nfeed is a measure of grape husks which you shall have preserved in\r\njars. By day turn the cattle out and at night feed twenty-five pounds\r\nof hay to each steer. If hay is short, feed the leaves of the ilex and\r\nivy.[35] Stack the straw of wheat, barley, beans, vetch and lupine,\r\nindeed all the grain straws, but pick out and house the best of it.\r\nScatter your straw with salt and you can then feed it in place of hay.\r\nWhen in the spring you begin to feed (more heavily to prepare for\r\nwork), feed a measure of mast or of grape husks, or a measure of\r\nground lupines, and fifteen pounds of hay. When the clover is ripe,\r\nfeed that first. Gather it by hand so that it will bloom a second\r\ntime, for what you harvest with the sickle blooms no more. Feed clover\r\nuntil it is dry, then feed vetch and then panic grass, and after the\r\npanic grass feed elm leaves. If you have poplar, mix that with the elm\r\nso that the elm may last the longer. If you have no elm feed oak and\r\nfig leaves.\r\n\r\nNothing is more profitable than to take good care of your cattle.\r\n\r\nCattle should not be put out to graze except in winter when they are\r\nnot worked; for when they eat green stuff they expect it all the time,\r\nand it is then necessary to muzzle them while they plough.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the care of live stock_\r\n\r\n(V) The flocks and herds should be well supplied with litter and their\r\nfeet kept clean. If litter is short, haul in oak leaves, they will\r\nserve as bedding for sheep and cattle. Beware of scab among the sheep\r\nand cattle. This comes from hunger and exposure to rain.\r\n\r\n(LXXII) To prevent the oxen from wearing down their hoofs, anoint\r\nthe bottom of the hoof with liquid pepper before driving them on the\r\nhighroad.\r\n\r\n(LXXIII) Take care that during the summer the cattle drink only sweet\r\nand fresh water. Their health depends on it.\r\n\r\n(XCVI) To prevent scab among sheep, make a mixture of equal parts of\r\nwell strained amurca,[36] of water in which lupine has been steeped,\r\nand of lees of good wine. After shearing, anoint all the flock with\r\nthis mixture, and let them sweat profusely for two or three days. Then\r\ndip them in the sea. If you have no sea water, make salt water and dip\r\nthen in that. If you will do this they will suffer no scab, they will\r\nhave more and better wool and they will not be molested by ticks.\r\n\r\n(LXXI) If an ox begins to sicken, give him without delay a raw hen's\r\negg and make him swallow it whole. The next day make him drink from a\r\nwooden bowl a measure of wine in which has been scraped the head of an\r\nonion. Both the ox and his attendant should do these things fasting\r\nand standing upright.\r\n\r\n(CII) If a serpent shall bite an ox, or any other quadruped, take a\r\ncup of that extract of fennel, which the physicians call smyrnean, and\r\nmix it with a measure of old wine. Inject this through his nostrils\r\nand at the same time poultice the wound with hogs' dung.[37] You can\r\ntreat a man the same way.\r\n\r\n(CLX) If a bone is dislocated it can be made sound by this\r\nincantation. Take a green reed four or five feet long, split it down\r\nthe middle and let two men hold the pieces against your hips. Begin\r\nthen to chant as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"In Alio. S.F. Motas Vaeta,\r\n  Daries Dardaries Astataries Dissunapiter\"\r\n\r\nand continue until the free ends of the reed are brought slowly\r\ntogether in front of you. Meanwhile, wave a knife above the reeds, and\r\nwhen they come together and one touches the other, seize them in your\r\nhand and cut them right and left. These pieces of reed bound upon a\r\ndislocated or fractured bone will cure it.[38]\r\n\r\nBut every day repeat the incantation, or in place of it this one:\r\n\r\n  \"Huat Hanat Huat\r\n  Ista Pista Sista\r\n  Domiabo Damnaustra\"[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of cakes and salad_[40]\r\n\r\n(LXXV) This is the recipe for cheese cake (_libum_): Bray well two\r\npounds of cheese in a mortar, and, when this is done, pour in a pound\r\nof corn meal (or, if you want to be more dainty, a half pound of\r\nflour) and mix it thoroughly with the cheese. Add one egg and beat it\r\nwell. Pat into a cake, place it on leaves and bake slowly on a hot\r\nhearth stone under a dish.\r\n\r\n(CXIX) This is the recipe for olive salad (_epityrum_): Select some\r\nwhite, black and mottled olives and stone them. Mix and cut them up.\r\nAdd a dressing of oil, vinegar, coriander, cumin, fennel, rue and\r\nmint. Mix well in an earthen ware dish, and serve with oil.\r\n\r\n(CXXI) This is the recipe for must cake (_mustaceus_): Sprinkle a peck\r\nof wheat flour with must. Add anise, cumin, two pounds of lard, a\r\npound of cheese and shredded laurel twigs. When you have kneaded the\r\ndough, put laurel leaves under it and so bake.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of curing hams_\r\n\r\n(CLXII) This is the way to cure hams in jars or tubs: When you have\r\nbought your hams trim off the hocks. Take a half peck (_semodius_) of\r\nground Roman salt for each ham. Cover the bottom of the jar or tub\r\nwith salt and put in a ham, skin down. Cover the whole with salt and\r\nput another ham on top, and cover this in the same manner. Be careful\r\nthat meat does not touch meat. So proceed, and when you have packed\r\nall the hams, cover the top with salt so that no meat can be seen, and\r\nsmooth it out even. When the hams have been in salt five days, take\r\nthem all out with the salt and repack them, putting those which were\r\non top at the bottom. Cover them in the same way with salt and press\r\nthem down.\r\n\r\nAfter the twelfth day remove the hams finally, brush off the salt and\r\nhang them for two days in the wind. On the third day wipe them off\r\nclean with a sponge and rub them with (olive) oil. Then hang them in\r\nsmoke for two days, and on the third day rub them with a mixture of\r\n(olive) oil and vinegar.\r\n\r\nThen hang them in the meat house, and neither bats nor worms will\r\ntouch them.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARRO'S RERUM RUSTICARUM\r\n\r\nLIBRI TRES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I\r\n\r\nTHE HUSBANDRY OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n_Introduction: the literary tradition of country life_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n\r\nHad I leisure, Fundania, this book would be more worthy of you, but I\r\nwrite as best I may, conscious always of the necessity of haste: for,\r\nif, as the saying is, all life is but a bubble, the more fragile is\r\nthat of an old man, and my eightieth year admonishes me to pack my\r\nfardel and prepare for the long journey.\r\n\r\nYou have bought a farm and wish to increase its fertility by good\r\ncultivation, and you ask me what I would do with it were it mine. Not\r\nonly while I am still alive will I try to advise you in this, but I\r\nwill make my counsel available to you after I am dead. For as it befel\r\nthe Sibyl to have been of service to mankind not alone while she\r\nlived, but even to the uttermost generations of men after her demise\r\n(for we are wont after so many years still to have solemn recourse to\r\nher books for guidance in interpretation of strange portents), so\r\nmay not I, while I still live, bequeath my counsel to my nearest and\r\ndearest.[42] I will then write three books for you, to which you may\r\nhave recourse for guidance in all things which must be done in the\r\nmanagement of a farm.\r\n\r\nAnd since, as men say, the gods aid those who propitiate them, I will\r\nbegin my book by invoking divine approval, not like Homer and Ennius,\r\nfrom the Muses, nor indeed from the twelve great gods of the city\r\nwhose golden images stand in the forum, six male and as many female,\r\nbut from a solemn council of those twelve divinities who are the\r\ntutelaries of husbandmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFirst: I call upon Father Jupiter and Mother Earth, who fecundate all\r\nthe processes of agriculture in the air and in the soil, and hence are\r\ncalled the great parents.\r\n\r\n_Second_: I invoke the Sun and the Moon by whom the seasons for sowing\r\nand reaping are measured.\r\n\r\n_Third_: I invoke Ceres and Bacchus because the fruits they mature\r\nare most necessary to life, and by their aid the land yields food and\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_: I invoke Robigus and Flora by whose influence the blight is\r\nkept from crop and tree, and in due season they bear fruit (for which\r\nreason is the annual festival of the _robigalia_ celebrated in honour\r\nof Robigus, and that of the _floralia_ in honour of Flora).[43]\r\n\r\n_Next_: I supplicate Minerva, who protects the olive; and Venus,\r\ngoddess of the garden, wherefore is she worshipped at the rural wine\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\n_And last_: I adjure Lympha, goddess of the fountains, and Bonus\r\nEventus, god of good fortune, since without water all vegetation is\r\nstarved and stunted and without due order and good luck all tillage is\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so having paid my duty to the gods, I proceed to rehearse some\r\nconversations[44] concerning agriculture in which I have recently taken\r\npart. From them you will derive all the practical instruction you\r\nrequire, but in case any thing is lacking and you wish further\r\nauthority, I refer you to the treatises of the Greeks and of our own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Greek writers who have treated incidentally of agriculture are\r\nmore than fifty in number. Those whom you may consult with profit\r\nare Hieron of Sicily and Attalus Philometor, among the philosophers;\r\nDemocritus the physicist; Xenophon the disciple of Socrates; Aristotle\r\nand Theophrastus, the peripatetics; Archytas the pythagorean; likewise\r\nthe Athenian Amphilochus, Anaxipolis of Thasos, Apollodorus of Lemnos,\r\nAristophanes of Mallos, Antigonus of Cyme, Agathocles of Chios,\r\nApollonius of Pergamum, Aristandrus of Athens, Bacchius of Miletus,\r\nBion of Soli, Chaeresteus and Chaereas of Athens, Diodorus of Priene,\r\nDion of Colophon, Diophanes of Nicaea, Epigenes of Rhodes, Evagon\r\nof Thasos, Euphronius of Athens, and his name sake of Amphipolis,\r\nHegesias of Maronea, the two Menanders, one of Priene, the other of\r\nHeraclaea, Nicesius of Maronea, Pythion of Rhodes. Among the rest\r\nwhose countries I do not know, are Andiotion, Aeschrion, Aristomenes,\r\nAthenagoras, Crates, Dadis, Dionysius, Euphiton, Euphorion, Eubulus,\r\nLysimachus, Mnaseas, Menestratus, Plentiphanes, Persis, and\r\nTheophilus.\r\n\r\nAll those whom I have named wrote in prose, but there are those also\r\nwho have written in verse, as Hesiod of Ascra and Menecrates of\r\nEphesus.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural writer of the greatest reputation is, however, Mago\r\nthe Carthaginian[45] who wrote in the Punic tongue and collected in\r\ntwenty-eight books all the wisdom which before him had been scattered\r\nin many works. Cassius Dionysius of Utica translated Mago into Greek\r\nin twenty books (and dedicated his work to the praetor Sextilius), and\r\nnotwithstanding that he reduced Mago by eight books he cited freely\r\nfrom the Greek authors whom I have named. Diophanes made a useful\r\ndigest of Cassius in six books, which he dedicated to Deiotarus, King\r\nof Bithynia. I have ventured to compress the subject into the still\r\nsmaller compass of three books, the first on the husbandry of\r\nagriculture, the second on the husbandry of live stock and the third\r\non the husbandry of the steading.\r\n\r\nFrom the first book I have excluded all those things which I do not\r\ndeem to relate immediately to agriculture: thus having first limited\r\nmy subject I proceed to discuss it, following its natural divisions.\r\nMy information has been derived from three sources, my own experience,\r\nmy reading, and what I have heard from others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the definition of agriculture_\r\n\r\n_a. What it is not_\r\n\r\nII. On the holiday which we call Sementivae I came to the temple\r\nof Tellus at the invitation of the Sacristan (I was taught by my\r\nancestors to call him _Aeditumus_ but the modern purist tells me\r\nI must say _Aedituus_). There I found assembled C. Fundanius, my\r\nfather-in-law, C. Agrius, a Roman Knight and a disciple of the\r\nSocratic school, and P. Agrasius, of the Revenue service: they were\r\ngazing on a map of Italy painted on the wall. \"What are you doing\r\nhere?\" said I. \"Has the festival of the seed-sowing drawn you hither\r\nto spend your holiday after the manner of our ancestors, by praying\r\nfor good crops?\" \"We are here,\" said Agrius, \"for the same reason that\r\nyou are, I imagine--because the Sacristan has invited us to dinner. If\r\nthis be true, as your nod admits, wait with us until he returns, for\r\nhe was summoned by his chief, the aedile, and has not yet returned\r\nthough he left word for us to wait for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until he comes then,\" said I, \"let us make a practical application of\r\nthe ancient proverb that 'The Roman conquers by sitting down.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" cried Agrius, and, remembering that the first step of\r\na journey is the most difficult,[46] he lead the way to the benches\r\nforthwith and we followed. When we were seated Agrasius spoke up.\r\n\"You who have travelled over many lands,\" said he, \"have you seen any\r\ncountry better cultivated than Italy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, for one, don't believe,\" replied Agrius, \"that there is any\r\ncountry which is so intensely cultivated. By a very natural division\r\nEratosthenes has divided the earth into two parts, that facing South\r\nand that facing North: and as without doubt the North is healthier\r\nthan the South, so it is more fertile, for a healthy country is always\r\nthe most fertile. It must be admitted then that the North is fitter\r\nfor cultivation than Asia, and particularly is this true of Italy;\r\nfirst, because Italy is in Europe, and, second, because this part of\r\nEurope has a more temperate climate than the interior. For almost\r\neverlasting winter grips the lands to the North of us. Nor is this to\r\nbe wondered at since there are regions within the Arctic Circle and at\r\nthe pole where the sun is not seen for six months at a time. Yea, it\r\nis even said that it is not possible to sail a ship in those parts\r\nbecause the very sea is frozen over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you think it possible,\" said Fundanius, \"for any thing to grow\r\nin such a region, and, if it did grow, how could it be cultivated? The\r\ntragedian Pacuvius has spoken sooth where he says:\r\n\r\n  'Should sun or night maintain e'er lasting reign,\r\n  Then all the grateful fruits of earth must die,\r\n  Nipped by the cold, or blasted by the heat.'\r\n\r\nEven here in this pleasant region, where night and day revolve\r\npunctually, I am not able to live in summer unless I divide the day\r\nwith my appointed midday nap. How is it possible to plant or to\r\ncultivate or to harvest any thing there where the days and nights are\r\nsix months long. On the other hand, what useful thing is there which\r\ndoes not only grow but flourish in Italy? What spelt shall I compare\r\nwith that of Campania? What wheat with that of Apulia? What wine with\r\nthat of Falernum? What oil with that of Venafrum? Is not Italy so\r\ncovered with fruit trees that it seems one vast orchard? Is Phrygia,\r\nwhich Homer calls [Greek: ampeloessa], more teeming with vines, or\r\nis Argos, which the same poet calls [Greek: polupuros] more rich in\r\ncorn?[47] In what land does one jugerum produce ten, nay even fifteen,\r\ncullei of wine, as in some regions of Italy? Has not M. Cato written\r\nin his book of _Origines_ 'That region lying this side of Ariminium\r\nand beyond Picenum, which was allotted to colonists, is called Roman\r\nGaul. There in several places a single jugerum of land produces ten\r\ncullei of wine.' Is it not the same in the region of Faventia where\r\nthe vines are called _tre centaria_ because a jugerum yields three\r\nhundred amphorae of wine,\" and, looking at me, he added, \"indeed L.\r\nMartius, your chief engineer, said that the vines on his Faventine\r\nfarm yielded that much.[48] The Italian farmer looks chiefly for\r\ntwo things in considering a farm, whether it will yield a harvest\r\nproportioned to the capital and labour he must invest, and whether the\r\nlocation is healthy. Whoever neglects either of these considerations\r\nand despite them proposes to carry on a farm, is a fool and should be\r\ntaken in charge by a committee of his relatives.[49] For no sane man is\r\nwilling to spend on an agricultural operation time and money which he\r\nknows he cannot recoup, nor even if he sees a likely profit, if it\r\nmust be at the risk of losing all by an evil climate.\r\n\r\n\"But there are here present those who can discourse on this subject\r\nwith more authority than I, for I see C. Licinius Stolo and Cn.\r\nTremelius Scrofa approaching. It was the ancestor of the first of\r\nthese who brought in the law for the regulation of land-holding; for\r\nthe law which forbade a Roman citizen to own more than 500 jugera of\r\nland was proposed by that Licinius who acquired the cognomen of Stolo\r\non account of his diligence in cultivating his land: he is said to\r\nhave dug around his trees so thoroughly that there could not be found\r\non his farm a single one of those suckers which spring up from the\r\nground at the roots of trees and are called _stolones_. Of the same\r\nfamily was that other C. Licinius who, when he was tribune of the\r\npeople, 365 years after the expulsion of the Kings, first transferred\r\nthe Sovereign function of law making from the Comitium to the Forum,\r\nthus as it were constituting that area the 'farm' of the entire\r\npeople.[50] The other whom I see come hither is Cn. Tremelius Scrofa,\r\nyour colleague on the Committee of Twenty for the division of the\r\nCampanian lands, a man distinguished by all the virtues and considered\r\nto be the Roman most expert in agriculture.[51]\r\n\r\n\"And justly so,\" I exclaimed, \"for his farms are a more pleasing\r\nspectacle to many on account of their clean cultivation than the\r\nstately palaces of others;[52] when one goes to visit his country\r\nplace, one sees granaries and not picture galleries, as at the 'farm'\r\nof Lucullus.[53] Indeed,\" I added, \"the apple market at the head of the\r\nSacred Way is the very image of Scrofa's fruit house.\"\r\n\r\nAs the new comers joined us, Stolo inquired: \"Have we arrived after\r\ndinner is over, for we do not see L. Fundilius who invited us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be of good cheer,\" replied Agrius, \"for not only has that egg which\r\nindicates the last lap of the chariot race in the games at the circus\r\nnot yet been removed, but we have not even seen that other egg which\r\nis the first course of dinner.[54] And so until the Sacristan returns\r\nand joins us do you discourse to us of the uses or the pleasures of\r\nagriculture, or of both. For now the sceptre of agriculture is in your\r\nhands, which formerly, they say, belonged to Stolo.\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" began Scrofa, \"we must have a definition. Are we to be\r\nlimited in discussing agriculture to the planting of the land or are\r\nwe to touch also on those other occupations which are carried on in\r\nthe country, such as feeding sheep and cattle. For I have observed\r\nthat those who write on agriculture, whether in Greek or Punic or\r\nLatin, wander widely from their subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that those authors should be imitated in that,\" said\r\nStolo, \"for I deem them to have done better who have confined the\r\nsubject to the straitest limits, excluding all considerations which\r\nare not strictly pertinent to the subject. Wherefore the subject of\r\ngrazing, which many writers treat as a part of agriculture, seems to\r\nme to belong rather to a treatise on live stock. That the occupations\r\nare different is apparent from the difference in the names of those we\r\nput in charge of them, for we call one the farmer (_villicus_) and the\r\nother the herdsman (_magister pecoris_). The farmer is charged with\r\nthe cultivation of the land and is so called from the _villa_ or farm\r\nhouse to which he hauls in the crops from the fields and from which he\r\nhauls them away when they are sold. Wherefore also the peasants say\r\n_vea_ for _via_, deriving their word for the road over which they haul\r\nfrom the name of the vehicle in which they do the hauling, _vectura_,\r\nand by the same derivation _vella_ for _villa_, the farm house to and\r\nfrom which they haul. In like manner the trade of a carrier is called\r\n_vellatura_ from the practice of driving a _vectura_, or cart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said Fundanius, \"feeding cattle is one thing and agriculture\r\nis another, but they are related. Just as the right pipe of the\r\n_tibia_ is different from the left pipe, yet are they complements\r\nbecause while the one leads, it is to carry the air, and the other\r\nfollows, it is for the accompaniment.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, to push your analogy further, it may be added,\" said I, \"that\r\nthe pastoral life, like the _tibia dextra_, has led and given the cue\r\nto the agricultural life, as we have on the authority of that learned\r\nman Dicaearchus who, in his _Life of Greece_ from the earliest times,\r\nshows us how in the beginning men pursued a purely pastoral life and\r\nknew not how to plough nor to plant trees nor to prune them; only\r\nlater taking up the pursuits of agriculture; whence it may be\r\nsaid that agriculture is in harmony with the pastoral life but is\r\nsubordinate to it, as the left pipe is to the right pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beware,\" exclaimed Agrius, \"of pushing your musical analogy too far,\r\nfor you would not only rob the farmer of his cattle and the shepherd\r\nof his livelihood but you would even break the law of the land in\r\nwhich it is written that a farmer may not graze a young orchard with\r\nthat pestiferous animal which astrology has placed in the heavens near\r\nthe Bull.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, Agrius,\" said Fundanius, \"let there be no mistake about\r\nthis. The law you cite applies only to certain designated kinds of\r\ncattle, as indeed there are kinds of cattle which are the foes and the\r\nbane of agriculture such as those you have mentioned--the goats--for\r\nby their nibbling they ruin young plantations, and not the least vines\r\nand olives. But, because the goat is the greatest offender in this\r\nrespect, we have a rule for him which works both ways, namely: that\r\nvictims of his family are grateful offerings on the altar of one god\r\nbut should never come near the fane of another; since by reason of the\r\nsame hate one god is not willing even to see a goat and the other is\r\npleased to see him killed. So it is that goats found among the vines\r\nare sacrificed to Father Bacchus as it were that they should pay the\r\npenalty of their evil doing with their lives; while on the contrary\r\nnothing of the goat kind is ever sacrificed to Minerva, because they\r\nare said to make the olive sterile even by licking it, for their very\r\nspittle is poison to the fruit. For this reason goats are never\r\ndriven into the Acropolis of Athens, except once a year for a certain\r\nnecessary sacrifice, lest the olive tree, which is said to have its\r\norigin there,[55] might be touched by a goat.\"\r\n\r\n\"No kind of cattle,\" said I, \"are of any use to agriculture except\r\nthose which aid in the cultivation of the land, as they do when they\r\nare yoked to the plough.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this was so,\" said Agrasius, \"how could we afford to take cattle\r\noff the land, since it is from our flocks and herds that we derive the\r\nmanure which is of the greatest benefit to our purely agricultural\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\n\"On your argument of convenience,\" said Agrius, \"we might claim that\r\nslave dealing was a branch of agriculture, if they were agricultural\r\nslaves which we dealt in. The error lies in the assumption that\r\nbecause cattle are good for the land, they make crops grow on the\r\nland. It does not follow, for by that reasoning other things would\r\nbecome part of agriculture which have nothing to do with it: as for\r\nexample spinsters and weavers and other craftsmen which you might keep\r\non your farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us then agree,\" said Scrofa, \"to exclude live stock from our\r\nconsideration of the art of agriculture. Does any one want to exclude\r\nany thing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we to follow the book of the two Sasernas,\" I inquired, \"and\r\ndiscuss whether the manufacture of pottery is more related to\r\nagriculture than mining for silver or other metals? Doubtless the\r\nmaterial comes out of the ground in both cases, but no one claims\r\nthat quarrying for stone or washing sand has any thing to do with\r\nagriculture, so why bring in the potter? It is not a question of what\r\ncomes out of the land, nor of what can be done profitably on a farm,\r\nfor if it were it might as well be argued that had one a farm lying\r\nalong a frequented road and a site on it convenient to travellers,\r\nit would be the farmer's business to build a cross-roads tavern. But\r\nsurely, however profitable this might prove, it would not make the\r\nspeculation any part of agriculture. It is not, I repeat, whether the\r\nbusiness is carried on on account of the land, nor out of the land,\r\nthat it may be classed as a part of agriculture, but only if from\r\nplanting the land one gains a profit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are jealous of this great writer,\" interrupted Stolo. \"Because of\r\nhis unfortunate potteries you rebuke him captiously and give him no\r\ncredit for all the admirable things which he says about matters which\r\ncertainly relate to agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nAt this sally, Scrofa, who knew the book and justly contemned it,\r\nsmiled, whereupon Agrasius, who thought that he and Stolo alone knew\r\nthe book demanded of Scrofa a quotation from it.\r\n\r\n\"Here is his recipe for getting rid of bugs,\" said Scrofa. \"'Steep a\r\nwild cucumber in water and where-ever you sprinkle it the bugs will\r\ndisappear,' and again, 'Grease your bed with ox gall mixed with\r\nvinegar.'\"\r\n\r\nFundanius looked at Scrofa. \"And yet Saserna gives good advice even if\r\nit is in a book on agriculture,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by Hercules,\" said Scrofa, \"and especially in his recipe for\r\nremoving superfluous hair, in which he bids you take a yellow frog and\r\nstew it down to a third of its size and then rub the body with what is\r\nleft.\"[56]\r\n\r\n\"I would rather cite,\" said I, \"Sasernas' prescription for the malady\r\nfrom which Fundanius suffers, for his corns make wrinkles on his\r\nbrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, pray, quickly,\" exclaimed Fundanius, \"for I had rather learn\r\nhow to root out my corns than how to plant beet roots.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you,\" said Stolo, \"in the very words he wrote it, or at\r\nleast as I heard Tarquenna read it: 'When a man's feet begin to hurt\r\nhe should think of you to enable you to cure him.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thinking of you,\" said Fundanius, \"now cure my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to the incantation,\" said Stolo.\r\n\r\n  'May the earth keep the malady,\r\n  May good health remain here.'\r\n\r\nSaserna bids you chant this formula thrice nine times, to touch the\r\nearth, to spit and be sure that you do it all before breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find,\" said I, \"many other wonderful secrets in Saserna, all\r\nequally foreign to agriculture, and so all to be left where they are.\r\nBut it must be admitted that such digressions are found in many other\r\nauthors. Does not the agricultural treatise of the great Cato himself\r\nfairly bristle with them, as for instance his instructions how to make\r\nmust cake and cheese cake, and how to cure hams?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" said Agrius, \"his most important precept: 'If you wish\r\nto drink freely and dine well in company, you should eat five leaves\r\nof raw cabbage steeped in vinegar, before sitting down to the table.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. What agriculture is_\r\n\r\nIII. \"And so,\" said Agrasius, \"as we have agreed upon and eliminated\r\nfrom the discussion all those things which agriculture is not, it\r\nremains to discuss what it is. Is it an art, and, if so, what are its\r\nprinciples and its purposes?\"\r\n\r\nStolo turned to Scrofa and said: \"You are our senior in age, in\r\nreputation and in experience, you should speak.\" And Scrofa, nothing\r\nloath, began as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, agriculture is not only an art but an art which\r\nis as useful as it is important. It is furthermore a science, which\r\nteaches how every kind of land should be planted and cultivated, and\r\nhow to know what kind of land will produce the largest crops for the\r\nlongest time.[57]\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_The purposes of agriculture are profit and pleasure_\r\n\r\nIV. The elements with which this science deals are the same as those\r\nwhich Ennius says are the elements of the universe--water, earth,\r\nair and fire. Before sowing your seed it behooves you to study these\r\nelements because they are the origin of all growing things. So\r\nprepared, the farmer should direct his efforts to two ends: profit and\r\npleasure,[58] one solid the other agreeable: but he should give the\r\npreference to the pursuit of profit.[59] And yet those who have regard\r\nfor appearances in their farming, as for instance by planting their\r\norchards and olive yards in orderly array, often add not only to the\r\nproductiveness of the farm but as well to its saleability, and so\r\ndoubly increase the value of their estate. For of two things of equal\r\nusefulness, who would not prefer to buy the better looking?\r\n\r\nThe farm which is healthiest is the most valuable, for there the\r\nprofit is certain. On the other hand, on an unhealthy farm, however\r\nfertile it may be, misfortune dogs the steps of the farmer. For where\r\nthe struggle is against Death, there not only is the profit uncertain,\r\nbut one's very existence is constantly at risk: and so agriculture\r\nbecomes a gamble in which the farmer hazards both his life and his\r\nfortune. And yet this risk can be diminished by forethought, for, when\r\nhealth depends upon climate, we can do much to control nature and by\r\ndiligence improve evil conditions. If the farm is unhealthy by reason\r\nof the plight of the land itself, or of the water supply, or is\r\nexposed to the miasma which breeds in some localities, or if the farm\r\nis too hot on account of the climate, or is exposed to mischievous\r\nwinds, these discomforts can be mitigated by one who knows what to do\r\nand is willing to spend some money. What is of the greatest importance\r\nin this respect is the situation of the farm buildings, their plan\r\nand convenience, and what is the aspect of their doors and gates and\r\nwindows. During the great plague, Hippocrates the physician saved not\r\nmerely one farm but many cities because he knew this. But why should\r\nI summon him as a witness: for when the army and the fleet lay at\r\nCorcyra[60] and all the houses were crowded with the sick and dying,\r\ndid not our Varro here contrive to open new windows to the healthy\r\nNorth wind and close those which gave entrance to the infected breezes\r\nof the South, to change doors and to do other such things, and so\r\nsucceed in restoring his comrades safe and sound to their native land?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The fourfold division of the study of agriculture_\r\n\r\nV. I have rehearsed the elements and the purposes of agriculture, it\r\nnow remains to consider in how many divisions this science is to be\r\nstudied.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have supposed these to be without number,\" said Agrius, \"when I\r\nhave read the many books which Theophrastus wrote on _The History of\r\nPlants_ and _The Causes of Vegetation_.\r\n\r\n\"These books,\" said Stolo, \"have always seemed to me to be fitter\r\nfor use in the schools of the philosophers than in the hands of a\r\npractical farmer. I do not mean to say that they do not contain many\r\nthings which are both useful and practical. However that may be, do\r\nyou rather explain to us the divisions in which agriculture should be\r\nstudied.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are four chapters for the study of agriculture, of the highest\r\npractical importance,\" resumed Scrofa, \"namely:\"\r\n\r\n1° What are the physical characteristics of the land to be cultivated,\r\nincluding the constitution of the soil;\r\n\r\n2° What labour and equipment are necessary for such cultivation;\r\n\r\n3° What system of farming is to be practised;\r\n\r\n4° What are the season? at which the several farming operations are to\r\nbe carried out.\r\n\r\nEach of these four chapters may be divided in at least two\r\nsubdivisions:\r\n\r\nThe first into (_a_) a study of the soil, and (_b_) a survey of the\r\nbuildings and stabling.\r\n\r\nThe second into an enquiry as to (_c_), the men who will carry on the\r\nfarming operations, and (_d_) the implements they will require.\r\n\r\nThe third into (_e_) the kind of work to be planned, and (_f_) where\r\nthat work is to be done.\r\n\r\nThe fourth into what relates (_g_) to the annual revolution of the\r\nsun, and (_h_) the monthly revolution of the moon.\r\n\r\nI will speak of the four principal parts first, and then in detail of\r\nthe eight subdivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n1° CONCERNING THE FARM ITSELF\r\n\r\n\r\n_How conformation of the land affects agriculture_\r\n\r\nVI. Four things must be considered in respect of the physical\r\ncharacteristics of the farm: its conformation, the quality of\r\nthe soil, its extent, and whether it is naturally protected. The\r\nconformation is either natural, or artificial as the result of\r\ncultivation, and may be good or bad in either case. I will speak first\r\nof natural conformation, of which there are three kinds: plain, hill\r\nand mountain--although there is a fourth kind made up of a combination\r\nof any two or all three of those mentioned, as may be seen in many\r\nplaces. A different system of cultivation is required for each of\r\nthese three kinds of farms, for without doubt that which is suited for\r\nthe hot plain would not suit the windy mountain, while a hill farm\r\nenjoys a more temperate climate than either of the other two kinds and\r\nso demands its own system of cultivation. These distinctions are most\r\napparent when the several characteristic conformations are of large\r\nextent, as for example the heat and the humidity are greater in a\r\nbroad plain, like that of Apulia, while on a mountain like Vesuvius\r\nthe climate is usually fresher and so more healthy. Those who\r\ncultivate the lowlands feel the effects of their climate most in\r\nsummer, but they are able to do their planting earlier in the spring,\r\nwhile those who dwell in the mountains suffer most from their climate\r\nin winter, and both sow and reap at later seasons. Frequently the\r\nwinter is more propitious to those who dwell in the plains because\r\nthen the pastures are fresh there and the trees may be pruned more\r\nreadily. On the other hand the summer is more kindly in the mountains\r\nfor then the upland grass is rich when the pastures of the plains are\r\nburnt, and it is more comfortable to cultivate the trees in a keen\r\nair.\r\n\r\nA lowland farm is best when it is gently sloping rather than\r\nabsolutely flat, because on a flat farm water cannot run off and so\r\nforms swampy places. But it is a disadvantage to have the surface too\r\nrolling because that causes the water to collect and form ponds.\r\n\r\nCertain trees, like the fir and the pine, flourish most in the\r\nmountains on account of the eager air, while in this region where it\r\nis more temperate the poplars and the willows thrive best. Again the\r\narbute and the oak prefer the more fertile lands, while the almond and\r\nthe fig trees love the lowlands.[61] The growth on the low hills takes\r\non more of the character of the plains, on the high hills that of the\r\nmountains. For these reasons the kind of crops to be planted must be\r\nsuited to the physical characteristics of the farm, as grain for the\r\nplains, vines for the hills and forests for the mountains.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations should be weighed separately with reference\r\nto each of the three kinds of conformation.\r\n\r\nVII. \"It seems to me,\" said Stolo, \"that, so far as concerns the\r\nnatural situation of a farm, Cato's opinion is just. He wrote, you\r\nwill recall, that the best farm was one which lay at the foot of a\r\nmountain looking to the South.\"\r\n\r\nScrofa resumed: \"So far as concerns the laying out of the farm, I\r\nmaintain that the more appearances are considered the greater will be\r\nthe profit, as, for instance, orchards should be planted in straight\r\nlines arranged in quincunxes and at a reasonable distance apart. It\r\nis a fact that, because of their unintelligent plan of planting, our\r\nancestors made less wine and corn to the acre than we do. The point is\r\nthat if each plant is set with due reference to the others they occupy\r\nless land and are less likely to screen from one another the influence\r\nof the sun and the moon and the air. This may be illustrated by an\r\nexperiment: you can press a parcel of nuts with their shells on into a\r\nmeasure having only two thirds of the capacity of what is required to\r\ncontain them after they have been cracked, because the shells keep\r\nthem naturally compacted. When trees are planted in rows the sun and\r\nthe moon have access to them equally from all sides, with the result\r\nthat more raisins and olives are developed and then mature more\r\nquickly, a double result with the double consequence of a larger crop\r\nof must and oil and a greater profit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_How character of soil affects agriculture_\r\n\r\n\"We will now take up the second consideration in respect of the\r\nphysical characteristics of a farm, namely: the quality of the soil,\r\nwhich partly, if not entirely, determines whether it is considered a\r\ngood or a bad farm: for on this depends what crops can be planted and\r\nharvested and how they should be cultivated, as it is not possible\r\nto plant everything successfully on the same soil. For one soil is\r\nsuitable for vines, another for corn, and others for other things. In\r\nthe island of Crete, near Cortynia, there is said to be a plane tree\r\nwhich does not lose its leaves even in winter--a phenomenon due\r\ndoubtless to the quality of the soil. There is another of the same\r\nkind in Cyprus, according to Theophrastus. Likewise within sight of\r\nthe city of Sybaris (which is now called Thurii) stands an oak having\r\nthe same characteristic. Again at Elephantine neither the vines nor\r\nthe fig trees lose their leaves, something that never happens with\r\nus. For the same reason many trees bear fruit twice a year, as do\r\nthe vines near the sea at Smyrna, and the apples in the fields of\r\nConsentinium. The effect of soil appears also from the fact that those\r\nplants which bear most profusely in wild places produce better fruit\r\nunder cultivation. The same explanation applies to those plants which\r\ncannot live except in a marshy place, or indeed in the very water:\r\nthey are even nice about the kind of water, some grow in ponds like\r\nthe reeds at Reate, others in streams like the alders in Epirus, some\r\neven in the sea like the palms and the squills of which Theophrastus\r\nwrites. When I was in the army, I saw in Transalpine Gaul, near the\r\nRhine, lands where neither the vine, nor the olive, nor the pear tree\r\ngrew, where they manured their fields with a white chalk which they\r\ndug out of the ground:[62] where they had no salt, either mineral or\r\nmarine, but used in place of it the salty ashes obtained from burning\r\na certain kind of wood.\"\r\n\r\nStolo here interrupted. \"You will recall,\" he said, \"that Cato in\r\ncomparing the different kinds of soil, ranked them by their merit in\r\nnine classes according to what they would produce, of which the first\r\nwas that on which the vine would grow a plentiful supply of good wine;\r\nthe second that fit for an irrigated garden; the third for an osier\r\nbed; the fourth for an olive yard; the fifth for a meadow; the sixth\r\nfor a corn field; the seventh for a wood lot; the eighth for a\r\ncultivated orchard, and the ninth for a mast grove.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know he wrote that,\" replied Scrofa, \"but every one does not agree\r\nwith him. There are some who put a good pasture first, and I am among\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nOur ancestors were wont to call them not _prala_, as we do, but\r\n_parata_ (because they are always ready for use). The sedile Caesar\r\nVopicus, in pleading a cause before the Censors, once said that the\r\nprairie of Rosea was the nurse of Italy, because if one left his\r\nsurveying instruments there on the ground over night they were lost\r\nnext day in the growth of the grass.[63]\r\n\r\n\r\n(_A digression on the maintenance of vineyards_)\r\n\r\nVIII. There be those who assert that the cost of maintaining a\r\nvineyard eats up the profit. What kind of vineyard? I ask. For there\r\nare several: in one the vines grow on the ground without props, as in\r\nSpain; in another, which is the kind common in Italy, the vines climb\r\nand are trained either separately on props or one with another on a\r\ntrellis, which last is what is called marrying the vine. There are\r\nfour kinds of trellis in use--made out of poles, of reeds, of ropes\r\nand of vines themselves, which are in use respectively in Falerum, in\r\nArpinum, in Brundisium and in Mediolanum. There are two methods of\r\ntraining the vine on trellises, one upright, as is done in the country\r\nof Canusium; the other crossed and interwoven, as is the practice\r\ngenerally throughout Italy. If one obtains the material for his\r\ntrellises from his own land, the expense of maintaining that kind\r\nof vineyard is negligible, nor is it burdensome if the material is\r\nprocured from the neighbourhood. Such trellis material, as has been\r\ndescribed, can be grown at home by planting willows, reeds and rushes,\r\nor some thing of that kind; but if you propose to rely on the vines to\r\nform their own trellis, then you must plant an _arbustum_ where the\r\nvines can be trained on trees, such as maples, which the inhabitants\r\nof Mediolanum use for that purpose; or fig trees, on which the people\r\nof Canusium train their vines. Likewise there are four kinds of props\r\nused for the cultivation of unwedded vines; first, the planted post,\r\nwhich is called _ridicum_ and is best when fashioned out of oak or\r\njuniper; second, poles cut in the swamp, and the more seasoned they\r\nare the longer they will last, but it is the practice to reset them\r\nupside down when they rot out in the ground; third, for lack of some\r\nthing better, a bundle of reeds tied together and thrust into a\r\npointed tube of baked clay, which is then planted in the ground and\r\nserves to preserve the reeds from water rot; the fourth is what may be\r\ncalled the natural prop, when vines are swung from tree to tree. Vines\r\nshould be trained to the height of a man and the interval between the\r\nprops should be sufficient to give room for a yoke of oxen to plough.\r\nThe least expensive kind of a vineyard is that which brings wine to\r\nthe jug without the aid of any sort of prop. There are two of this\r\nkind, one in which the earth serves as a bed for the grapes, as in\r\nmany places in Asia, and where usually the foxes share the crop with\r\nman;[64] or, if mice appear, it is they who make the vintage, unless\r\nyou put a mouse trap in every vine, as they do on the island of\r\nPandataria. The other kind of vineyard, is that where each shoot which\r\npromises to bear grapes is lifted from the earth and supported about\r\ntwo feet off the ground by a forked stick: by this means the grapes,\r\nas they form, learn to hang as it were from a branch and do not have\r\nto be taught after the vintage; they are held in place with a bit of\r\ncord or by that kind of tie which the ancients called a _cestus_. As\r\nsoon as the farmer sees the vintagers turn their backs he carries\r\nthese props under cover for the winter so that he may use them another\r\nyear without expense for that account. In Italy the people of Reate\r\npractise this custom.\r\n\r\nThus there are as many methods of cultivating the vine as there are\r\nkinds of soil. For where the land is wet the vine must be trained high\r\nbecause when wine is being made and matured on the vine, it needs sun,\r\nnot water--as when it is in the cup! For this reason it was, I think,\r\nthat first the vine was made to grow on trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the different kinds of soil_\r\n\r\nIX. It is expedient then, as I was saying, to study each kind of soil\r\nto determine for what it is, and for what it is not, suitable. The\r\nword _terra_ is used in three senses: general, particular and mixed.\r\nIt is a general designation when we speak of the orb of the earth, the\r\nland of Italy or any other country. In this designation is included\r\nrock and sand and other such things. In the second place, _terra_ is\r\nreferred to particularly when it is spoken of without qualification or\r\nepithet. In the third place, which is the mixed sense, when one speaks\r\nof _terra_ as soil--that in which seeds are sown and developed; as for\r\nexample, clay soil or rocky soil or others. In this sense there are as\r\nmany kinds of earth as there are when one speaks of it in the general\r\nsense, on account of the mixtures of substances in it in varying\r\nquantities which make it of different heart and strength, such as\r\nrock, marble, sand, loam, clay, red ochre, dust, chalk, gravel,\r\ncarbuncle (which is a condition of soil formed by the burning of roots\r\nin the intense heat of the sun); from which each kind of soil is\r\ncalled by a particular name, in accordance with the substances of\r\nwhich it is composed, as a chalky soil, a gravelly soil, or what ever\r\nelse may be its distinguishing quality. And as there are different\r\nvarieties of soil so each variety may be subdivided according to\r\nits quality, as, for example, a rocky soil is either very rocky,\r\nmoderately rocky or hardly rocky at all. So three grades may be made\r\nof other mixed soils. In turn each of these three grades has three\r\nqualities: some are very wet, some very dry, some moderate, These\r\ndistinctions are of the greatest importance in respect of the crops,\r\nfor the skilled husbandman plants spelt rather than wheat in wet\r\nland, and on dry land barley rather than spelt, in medium land both.\r\nFurthermore there are still more subtle distinctions to be made\r\nin respect of all these kinds of soil, as for example it must be\r\nconsidered in respect of loam, whether it is white loam or red loam,\r\nbecause white loam is unfit for nursery beds, while red loam is what\r\nthey require. But the three great distinctions of quality of soil are\r\nwhether it is lean or fat, or medium. Fat soils are apparent from the\r\nheavy growth of their vegetation, and the lean lie bare; as witness\r\nthe territory of Pupinia (in Latium), where all the foliage is meagre\r\nand the vines look starved, where the scant straw never stools, nor\r\nthe fig tree blooms, while for the most part the trees are as covered\r\nwith moss as are the arid pastures. On the other hand, a rich soil\r\nlike that of Etruria reveals itself heavy with grain and forage crops\r\nand its umbrageous trees are clean of moss. Soil of medium strength,\r\nlike that near Tibur, which one might say is rather hungry than\r\nstarved, repays cultivation in proportion as it takes on the quality\r\nof rich land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Diophanes of Bithynia,\" said Stolo, \"was very much to the point when he\r\nwrote that the best indication of the suitability of soil for\r\ncultivation can be had either from the soil itself or from what grows in\r\nit: so one should ascertain whether it is white or black, if it is light\r\nand friable when it is dug, whether its consistency is ashy, or too\r\nheavy: or it can be tested by evidence that the wild growth upon it is\r\nheavy and fruitful after its kind.[65] But proceed and tell us of your\r\nthird division, which relates to the measurement and laying out of the\r\nfarm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the units of area used in measuring land_\r\n\r\nX. Scrofa resumed: \"Every country has its own system for measuring\r\nland. In Further Spain the unit of area is the _jugum_, in Campania\r\nthe _versus_, here in the Roman country and among the Latins it is\r\nthe _jugerum_. They call a _jugum_ the area which a pair of oxen\r\ncan plough in a day. The _versus_ is one hundred feet square: the\r\n_jugerum_ is the area containing two square _actus_: the _actus\r\nquadratus_ or _acnua_, as it is called by the Latins, measuring 120\r\nfeet in width and as much in length.[66] The smallest fraction of a\r\njugerum is called a _scripulum_ and is ten feet square. From this base\r\nthe surveyors some times call the butts of land which exceed a jugerum\r\n_unciae_ (twelfths) or _sextantes_ (seventy seconds) or some other\r\nsuch duodecimal division, for the jugerum contains 288 scripula, like\r\nthe ancient pound weight which was in use before the Punic wars. Two\r\njugera, which Romulus first made the headright and which thus became\r\nthe unit of inheritance, are called an _haeredium_:[67] later one\r\nhundred haeredia were called a _centuria_, which is 2,400 _unciae_\r\nsquare. Four centuriae adjoining, so that there are two on each side,\r\nare called a _saltus_ in the distribution of the public lands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the considerations on building a steading_\r\n\r\n_a. Size_\r\n\r\nXI. As the result of faulty surveys of the farm it often happens that\r\nthe steading is constructed either too small or too large for the\r\nfarm, a mistake which in either case is of prejudice both to the\r\nproperty and its revenue. If one builds too large or too many\r\nbuildings he is eaten up by the expense of maintenance, while if one\r\nbuilds less than the farm requires the harvest is lost, for there is\r\nno doubt that the largest wine cellar must be provided for that farm\r\non which the vintages are largest, or granary, if it is a grain farm.\r\n\r\n_b. Water supply_\r\n\r\nIf possible, the steading should be so built that it shall have water\r\nwithin the walls, or certainly near at hand: it is preferable that\r\nthis should be derived from a spring, or, if not, then from an\r\nunfailing stream. If no running water is available a cistern should be\r\nconstructed within doors, and a pond in the open, the one for the use\r\nof the men, the other for the use of the cattle.\r\n\r\n_c. Location, with regard to health_\r\n\r\nXII. When you plan to build, try your best to locate the steading at\r\nthe foot of a wooded hill where the pastures are rich, and turn it so\r\nas to catch the healthiest prevailing breeze. The best situation is\r\nfacing the east so to secure shade in summer and sun in winter. But if\r\nyou must build on the bank of a river, take care that you do not let\r\nthe steading face the river, for it will be very cold in winter and\r\nunhealthy in summer. Like precautions must be taken against swampy\r\nplaces for the same reasons and particularly because as they dry,\r\nswamps breed certain animalculae which cannot be seen with the eyes\r\nand which we breathe through the nose and mouth into the body where\r\nthey cause grave maladies.\"[68]\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Fundanius, \"suppose I inherited a farm like that, what\r\nshould I do to avoid the malady you describe?\"\r\n\r\n\"The answer to that question is easy,\" said Agrius. \"You should sell\r\nthe farm for what you can get for it: and if you can't sell it, give\r\nit away.\"\r\n\r\nScrofa resumed: \"Take care to avoid having the steading face the\r\ndirection from which disagreeable winds blow, yet you should not build\r\nin a hollow. High ground is the best location for a steading: for by\r\nventilation all noxious gases are dissipated, and the steading is\r\nhealthier if exposed to the sun all day: with the further advantage\r\nthat any insects which may be bred in or brought upon the premises are\r\neither blown away or quickly perish where there is no damp. Sudden\r\nrains and overflowed streams are dangerous to those who have their\r\nsteadings in low or hollow places, and they are more at the hazard of\r\nthe ruthless hand of the robber because he is able to take advantage\r\nof those who are unprepared. Against either of these risks the higher\r\nplaces are safer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Arrangement_\r\n\r\nXIII. In arranging the steading, see that the cattle are put where\r\nthey will be warm in winter. Such crops as wine and oil should be\r\nhoused below ground in cellars, or rather in jars placed in such\r\ncellars, while dry crops like beans, and hay, are best stored on high\r\nboard floors. A rest room should be provided for the comfort of the\r\nhands where they can gather after the day's work or for protection\r\nfrom cold or heat and there recruit themselves in quiet. The room of\r\nthe overseer should be near the entrance to the farm house so that he\r\nmay know who comes in and who goes out during the night, and what they\r\nbring in or out, especially if there is no gate-keeper. The kitchen\r\nalso should be near the overseer's room because there in winter is\r\ngreat activity before daylight when food is being prepared and eaten.\r\nGood sized sheds should be built in the barn yard for the wagons and\r\nother implements which might be damaged by the rain. For while they\r\nmay be kept safe from the thief within the gates, yet if they are\r\nexposed to the weather they will be lost nevertheless. It is better to\r\nhave two barn yards for a large farm. The inner court should contain a\r\ncistern like a little fish pond into which the drainage from the eaves\r\nmay collect: as here the cattle and swine and geese can drink and\r\nbathe in summer when they are driven in from work or pasture. In the\r\nouter court there should be another pond where you can handle lupines\r\nand such other things as must be soaked in water. This exterior court\r\nyard should be strewn thick with straw and chaff, which, by being\r\ntrampled under the feet of the cattle, becomes the handmaid of the\r\nfarm by reason of the service it renders when it is hauled out. Every\r\nfarm should have two manure pits, or one divided into two parts; into\r\none division should be put the new manure from the barn, in the other\r\nthe old manure which is ready for use on the farm: for new manure is\r\nnot as good as that which is well rotted.[69] The manure pit is more\r\nserviceable when its sides and top are protected from the sun by\r\nleaves and branches, for the sun draws out from the manure those\r\nelements which the land requires; for this reason experienced farmers\r\nsprinkle water on their manure pits, and so largely preserve its\r\nquality: here too some establish the privies for the slaves. One\r\nshould build a barracks (what we call a _nubilarium_ because it\r\naffords protection from the weather) and it should be large enough to\r\ncontain under its roof the entire crop of the farm: this should be\r\nplaced near the threshing floor and left open only on the side of the\r\nthreshing floor, so that while threshing you may conveniently throw\r\nout the corn and if it begins to cloud up then quickly throw it back\r\nagain under shelter. There should be windows in this barracks on the\r\nside most fitted for ventilation.\"\r\n\r\n\"A farm would be more of a farm,\" said Fundanius, \"if the buildings\r\nwere constructed with reference to the diligence of our ancestors\r\nrather than the luxury of their descendants. For they built for use,\r\nwhile we build to gratify an unbridled luxury. Their barns were bigger\r\nthan their houses, but the contrary is often the case today. Then a\r\nhouse was praised if it had a good kitchen, roomy stables and a cellar\r\nfor wine and oil fitted, according to the custom of the country, with\r\na floor draining into a reservoir, into which the wine can flow when,\r\nas often happens after the new wine has been laid by, the fermentation\r\nof the must bursts both Spanish butts and our own Italian tuns. In\r\nlike manner our ancestors equipped a country house with whatever other\r\nthings were necessary to agriculture, but now on the contrary it is\r\nthe effort to make such a house as vast and as elegant as possible,\r\nand we vie with those palaces which men like Metellus and Lucullus\r\nhave built, to the detriment of the very state itself: in them the\r\neffort is to contrive summer dining rooms fronting the cool east, and\r\nthose designed for use in winter facing the western sun, rather than,\r\nas the ancients did, to adjust their windows with regard chiefly to\r\nthe cellars, since wine in casks keeps best when it is cool, while oil\r\ncraves warmth. For this reason also it would seem that the best place\r\nto put a house is on a hill, if nothing obstructs it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the protection of farm boundaries_\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. Fences_\r\n\r\nXIV. \"Now,\" resumed Scrofa, \"I will speak of fences, which are\r\nconstructed for the protection of the farm or for dividing the fields.\r\nThere are four kinds of such barriers: natural, dead wood, military\r\nand masonry. The first is the natural fence of live hedge, consisting\r\nof planted shrubs or thorns, and, as it has roots, runs no risk from\r\nthe flaming torch of the passing traveller who may be inclined to\r\nmischief. The second kind is built of the wood of the country, but\r\nis not alive. It is made either of palings placed close together and\r\nwattled with twigs, or posts placed at some distance apart and pierced\r\nto receive the ends of rails, which are generally built two or three\r\nto the panel, or else of trunks of trees laid on the ground and joined\r\nin line. The third, or military fence, consists of a ditch and a\r\nmound: but such a ditch should be so constructed to collect all the\r\nrain water, or it should be graded to drain the surface water off the\r\nfarm. The mound is best when constructed close adjoining the ditch, or\r\nelse it should be steep so that it will be difficult to scale. It is\r\ncustomary to construct this kind of fence along the public roads or\r\nalong streams. In the district of Crustumeria one can see in many\r\nplaces along the via Salaria ditches and mounds constructed as dikes\r\nagainst damage by the river (Tiber).[70] Mounds are some times built\r\nwithout ditches and are called walls, as in the country around Reate.\r\nThe fourth and last kind of fence is of built up masonry. There are\r\nusually four varieties: those of cut stone, as in the country around\r\nTusculum; those of burned brick, as in Gaul; those of unburned brick\r\nas in the Sabine country; those of gravel concrete,[71] as in Spain and\r\nabout Tarentum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Monuments_\r\n\r\nXV. Lacking fences, the more discreet establish the boundaries of\r\ntheir property, or of their sowings, by blazed trees, and so prevent\r\nneighbourhood quarrels and lawing about corners. Some plant pines\r\naround their boundaries, as my wife did on her Sabine farm, or\r\ncypresses, as I have on my property on Vesuvius.[72] Others plant elms,\r\nas many have done in the district of Crustumeria: indeed, for planting\r\nin plains where it flourishes there is no tree which can be set out\r\nwith such satisfaction or with more profit than the elm, for it\r\nsupports the vine and so fills many a basket with grapes, yields\r\nits leaves to be a most agreeable forage for flocks and herds, and\r\nsupplies rails for fences and wood for hearth and oven.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said Scrofa, \"I have expounded my four points upon the\r\nphysical characteristics of a farm, which were, its conformation, the\r\nquality of the soil, its extent and layout, its boundaries and their\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the considerations of neighbourhood_\r\n\r\nXVI. It remains to discuss the conditions outside the farm itself,\r\nfor the character of the neighbourhood is of the utmost importance to\r\nagriculture on account of the necessary relations with it. There\r\nare four considerations in this respect also, namely: whether the\r\nneighbourhood bears a bad reputation; whether it affords a market to\r\nwhich our products can be taken and whence we can bring back what we\r\nmay require at home; whether there is a road or a river leading to\r\nthat market, and, if so, whether it is fit for use; and fourth whether\r\nthere is in our immediate vicinity any thing which may be to our\r\nadvantage or disadvantage. Of these four considerations the most\r\nimportant is whether the neighbourhood bears a bad reputation: for\r\nthere are many farms which are fit for cultivation but not expedient\r\nto undertake on account of the brigandage in the neighbourhood, as in\r\nSardinia those farms which adjoin Oelium, and in Spain those on the\r\nborders of Lusitania.\r\n\r\nOn the second point those farms are the most profitable which have\r\nopportunities in the vicinity for marketing what they raise and buying\r\nwhat they must consume: for there are many farms which must buy corn\r\nor wine or what ever else they lack, and not a few which have a\r\nsurplus of these commodities for sale. So in the suburbs of a city it\r\nis fitting to cultivate gardens on a large scale, and to grow violets\r\nand roses and many other such things which a city consumes, while it\r\nwould be folly to undertake this on a distant farm with no facilities\r\nfor reaching the market. So, again, if there is nearby a town or a\r\nvillage or even the well furnished estate of a rich man where you can\r\nbuy cheap what you require on the farm, and where you can trade your\r\nsurplus of such things as props and poles and reeds, your farm will\r\nbe more profitable than if you had to buy at a distance; nay, more\r\nprofitable even than if you were able to produce all you require at\r\nhome: because in this situation you can make annual arrangements with\r\nyour neighbours to furnish on hire the services of physicians, fullers\r\nand blacksmiths to better advantage than if they were your own: for\r\nthe death of a single such skilled slave wipes out the entire profit\r\nof a farm. In carrying on the operation of a vast estate, the rich can\r\nafford to provide such servants for every department of the work:\r\nfor if towns and villages are far distant from the farm, they supply\r\nblacksmiths and all other necessary craftsmen and keep them on the\r\nplace, in order to prevent the hands from leaving the farm and\r\nspending working days in going leisurely to and from the shop when\r\nthey might more profitably be engaged on what should be done in the\r\nfields. So Saserna's book lays down the rule that \"No one may leave\r\nthe farm except the overseer, the butler, or such a one as the\r\noverseer sends on an errand. If any one disobeys this rule, he shall\r\nbe punished for it, but if he disobeys a second time the overseer\r\nshall be punished.\" This rule may be better stated that no one should\r\nleave the farm without the approval of the overseer, and, without the\r\nconsent of the master, not even the overseer, for more than a day at\r\na time, but in no event more frequently than the business of the farm\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nOn the third point, conveniences of transportation make a farm more\r\nprofitable, and these are whether the roads are in such condition that\r\nwagons can use them smoothly, or whether there are rivers nearby which\r\ncan be navigated. We know that each of these means of transportation\r\nis available to many farms.\r\n\r\nThe fourth point, which is concerned with how your neighbour has\r\nplanted his land, also relates to your profits: because if he has an\r\noak forest near your boundary, you cannot profitably plant olives in\r\nthat vicinity, for the oak is so perverse in its effect upon the olive\r\nthat not only will your trees bear less but they will even avoid the\r\noaks and bend away from them until they are prostrate on the ground,\r\nas the vine is wont to do when planted near vegetables. Like the oak,\r\na grove of thickly planted full grown walnut trees renders sterile all\r\nthe surrounding land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2° CONCERNING THE EQUIPMENT OF A FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. I have spoken of the four points of husbandry which relate to\r\nthe land to be cultivated and also of those other four points which\r\nhave to do with the outside relations of that land: now I will speak\r\nof those things which pertain to the cultivation of the land. Some\r\ndivide this subject into two parts, men and those assistants to men\r\nwithout which agriculture cannot be carried on. Others divide it into\r\nthree parts, the instruments of agriculture which are articulate,\r\ninarticulate and mute: the articulate being the servants,[73] the\r\ninarticulate the draught animals, and the mute being the wagons and\r\nother such implements.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of agricultural labourers_\r\n\r\nAll men carry on agriculture by means of slaves or freemen or both.\r\nThe freemen who cultivate the land do so either on their own account,\r\nas do many poor people with the aid of their own children, or for\r\nwages,[74] as when the heaviest farm operations, like the vintage and\r\nthe harvest, are accomplished with the aid of hired freemen: in which\r\nclass may be included those bond servants whom our ancestors called\r\n_obaerati_, a class which may still be found in Asia, in Egypt and in\r\nIllyricum. With respect to the use of freemen in agriculture, my own\r\nopinion is that it is more profitable to use hired hands than one's\r\nown slaves in cultivating unhealthy lands, and, even where the country\r\nis salubrious, they are to be preferred for the heaviest kind of farm\r\nwork, such as harvesting and storing grapes and corn. Cassius has this\r\nto say on the subject: 'Select for farm hands those who are fitted for\r\nheavy labour, who are not less than twenty-two years of age and have\r\nsome aptitude for agriculture, which can be ascertained by trying them\r\non several tasks and by enquiring as to what they did for their former\r\nmaster.' Slaves should be neither timid nor overconfident. The foreman\r\nshould have some little education, a good disposition and economical\r\nhabits, and it is better that they should be some what older than the\r\nhands, for then they will be listened to with more respect than if\r\nthey were boys. It is most important to choose as foremen those who\r\nare experienced in agricultural work, for they should not merely give\r\norders but lend a hand at the work, so that the labourers may learn\r\nby imitation and may also appreciate that it is greater knowledge and\r\nskill which entitles the foreman to command. The foreman should never\r\nbe authorized to enforce his discipline with the whip if he can\r\naccomplish his result with words.\r\n\r\nAvoid having many slaves of the same nation, for this gives rise to\r\ndomestic rows.\r\n\r\nThe foremen will work more cheerfully if rewards are offered them, and\r\nparticularly pains must be taken to see that they have some property\r\nof their own, and that they marry wives among their fellow servants,\r\nwho may bear them children, some thing which will make them\r\nmore steady and attach them to the place.[75] On account of such\r\nrelationships families of Epirote slaves are esteemed the best and\r\ncommand the highest prices.\r\n\r\nMarks of consideration by the master will go far in giving happiness\r\nto your hands: as, for instance, by asking the opinion of those of\r\nthem who have done good work, as to how the work ought to be done,\r\nwhich has the effect of making them think less that they are looked\r\ndown upon, and encourages them to believe that they are held in some\r\nestimation by the master.\r\n\r\nThose slaves who are most attentive to their work should be treated\r\nmore liberally either in respect of food or clothes, or in holidays,\r\nor by giving them permission to graze some cattle of their own on the\r\nplace, or some thing of that kind. Such liberality tempers the effect\r\nof a harsh order or a heavy punishment, and restores the slaves' good\r\nwill and kindly feeling towards their master.\r\n\r\nXVIII. On the subject of the number of slaves one will require for\r\noperating a farm, Cato lays down the two measures of the extent of\r\nthe farm and the kind of farming to be carried on. Writing about the\r\ncultivation of olives and vines he gives these formulas, viz.:\r\n\r\nFor carrying on an olive farm of two hundred and forty jugera,\r\nthirteen slaves are necessary, to-wit: an overseer, a housekeeper,\r\nfive labourers, three teamsters, an ass driver, a swineherd and a\r\nshepherd: for carrying on a vineyard of one hundred jugera, fifteen\r\nslaves are necessary, to-wit: an overseer, a housekeeper, ten\r\nlabourers, a teamster, an ass driver and a swineherd.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Saserna says that one man is enough for every eight\r\njugera,[76] as a man should cultivate that much land in forty-five\r\ndays: for while one man can cultivate a jugerum in four days, yet he\r\nallows thirteen days extra for the entire eight jugera to provide\r\nagainst the chance of bad weather, the illness or idleness of the\r\nlabourer and the indulgence of the master.[77]\r\n\r\nAt this Licinius Stolo put in.\r\n\r\n\"Neither of these writers has given us an adequate rule,\" he said.\r\n\"For if Cato intended, as he doubtless did, that we should add to\r\nor subtract from what he prescribes in proportion as our farm is of\r\ngreater or less extent than that he describes, he should have excluded\r\nthe overseer and the housekeeper from his enumeration. If you\r\ncultivate less than two hundred and forty jugera of olives you cannot\r\nget along with less than one overseer, while if you cultivate twice or\r\nmore as much land you will not require two or three overseers. It is\r\nthe number of labourers and teamsters only which must be added to or\r\ndiminished in proportion to the size of the farm: and this applies\r\nonly if the land is all of the same character, for if part of it is of\r\na kind which cannot be ploughed, as for example very rocky, or on\r\na steep hillside, there is that much less necessity for teams and\r\nteamsters. I pass over the fact that Cato's example of a farm of two\r\nhundred and forty jugera is neither a fair nor a comparable unit.[78]\r\nThe true unit for comparison of farms is a centuria, which contains\r\ntwo hundred jugera, but if one deducts forty jugera, or one-sixth,\r\nfrom Cato's two hundred and forty jugera, I do not see how in applying\r\nthis rule one can deduct also one-sixth of his thirteen slaves; or,\r\neven if we leave out the overseer and the housekeeper, how one can\r\ndeduct one-sixth of eleven slaves. Again, Cato says that one should\r\nhave fifteen slaves for one hundred jugera of vineyard, but suppose\r\none had a _centuria_ half in vines and half in olives, then, according\r\nto Cato's rule, one would require two overseers and two housekeepers,\r\nwhich is absurd. Wherefore it is necessary to find another measure\r\nthan Cato's for determining the number of slaves, and I myself think\r\nbetter of Saserna's rule, which is that for each jugerum it suffices\r\nto provide four days work of one hand. Yet, if this was a good rule\r\non Saserna's farm in Gaul, it might not apply on a mountain farm in\r\nLiguria. In fine you will best determine what number of slaves and\r\nwhat other equipment you will require if you diligently consider\r\nthree things, that is to say, what kind of farms are there in your\r\nneighbourhood, how large are they, and how many hands are engaged in\r\ncultivating them, and you should add to or subtract from that number\r\nin proportion as you take up more or less work. For nature gave us two\r\nschools of agriculture, which are experience and imitation. The most\r\nancient farmers established many principles by experiment and their\r\ndescendants for the most part have simply imitated them. We should\r\ndo both these things: imitate others and on our own account make\r\nexperiments, following always some principle, not chance:[79] thus we\r\nmight work our trees deeper or not so deep as others do to see what\r\nthe effect would be. It was with such intelligent curiosity that some\r\nfarmers first cultivated their vines a second and a third time, and\r\ndeferred grafting the figs from spring to summer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of draught animals_\r\n\r\nXIX. In respect of those instruments of agriculture which are called\r\ninarticulate, Saserna says that two yokes of oxen will be enough for\r\ntwo hundred jugera of arable land, while Cato prescribes three yokes\r\nfor two hundred and forty jugera in olives: thus if Saserna is\r\ncorrect, one yoke of oxen is required for every hundred jugera, but if\r\nCato is correct a yoke is needed for every eighty jugera. My opinion\r\nis that neither of these standards is appropriate for all kinds of\r\nland, but each for some kind: for some land is easy and some difficult\r\nto plough, and oxen are unable to break up some land except by great\r\neffort and often they leave the ploughshare in the furrow broken from\r\nthe beam: wherefore in this respect we should observe a triple rule on\r\nevery farm, when we are new to it, namely: find out the practice of\r\nthe last owner; that of the neighbours, and make some experiments of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\n\"Cato adds,\" resumed Scrofa, \"that on his olive farm there are\r\nrequired three asses to haul out the manure and one to turn the mill,\r\nand on his hundred jugera vineyard a yoke of oxen and a pair of asses\r\nfor the manure, and an ass for the wine press.\"\r\n\r\nIn respect of cattle kept for all these purposes, which it is\r\ncustomary to feed in the barn yard, it should be added that you should\r\nkeep as many and only as many as you need for carrying on the work of\r\nthe farm, so that more easily you can secure diligent care of\r\nthem from the servants whose chief care is of themselves. In this\r\nconnection the keeping of sheep is preferable to hogs not only by\r\nthose who have pastures but also by those who have none, for you\r\nshould keep them not merely because you have pasture, but for the sake\r\nof the manure.\r\n\r\nWatch dogs should be kept in any event for the safety of the farm.\r\n\r\nXX. The most important consideration with respect to barn yard cattle\r\nis that the draft oxen should be fit for their work: when bought\r\nunbroken they should not be less than three years old nor more than\r\nfour, strong, but well matched, lest the stronger wear out the weaker:\r\nwith large horns, black rather than any other color, broad foreheads,\r\nflat noses, deep chests and heavy quarters. Old steers which have\r\nworked in the plains cannot be trained to service in rough and\r\nmountain land; a rule as applicable when reversed. In breaking young\r\nsteers it is best to begin by fastening a fork shaped yoke on their\r\nnecks and leaving it there even when they are fed; in a few days they\r\nwill become used to it and disposed to be docile. Then they should be\r\nbroken to work gradually until they are accustomed to it, as may be\r\ndone by yoking a young ox with an old one, so that he may learn what\r\nis expected of him by imitation. It is best to work them first on\r\nlevel ground without a plough, then with a light plough, so that their\r\nfirst lessons may be easy and in sand and mellow soil.\r\n\r\nOxen intended for the wagon should be broken in the same way, at first\r\nby drawing an empty cart, if possible through the streets of a village\r\nor a town, where they may become quickly inured to sudden noises and\r\nstrange sights. You should not work an ox always on the same side of\r\nthe team, for an occasional change from right to left relieves the\r\nstrain of the work.\r\n\r\nWhere the land is light, as in Campania, they do not plough with heavy\r\nsteers but with cows or asses, as they can be driven more easily to\r\na light plough. For turning the mill and for carrying about the farm\r\nsome use asses, some cows and others mules: a choice determined by the\r\nsupply of provender. For an ass is cheaper to feed than a cow, though\r\na cow is more profitable.[80]\r\n\r\nIn the choice of the kind of draft animals he is to keep, a farmer\r\nshould always take into consideration the characteristics of his soil:\r\nthus on rocky and difficult land the prime requirement is doubtless\r\nstrength, but his purpose should be to keep that kind of stock which\r\nunder his conditions yields the largest measure of profit and still do\r\nall the necessary work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of watch dogs_\r\n\r\nXXI. It is more desirable to keep a few dogs and fierce ones than a\r\npack of curs. They should be trained to watch by night and to sleep by\r\nday chained in the kennel [so that they may be the more alert when set\r\nloose.]\r\n\r\nIt remains to speak elsewhere of unyoked cattle, like the flocks, but\r\nif there are meadows on the farm and the owner keeps no live stock, it\r\nis the business of a good farmer after he has sold his hay to graze\r\nand feed another's cattle on his land.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of farming implements_\r\n\r\nXXII. Concerning the instruments of agriculture which are called mute,\r\nin which are included baskets, wine jars and such things, this may be\r\nsaid: Those utensils which can be produced on the farm or made by the\r\nservants should never be bought, among which are what ever may be made\r\nout of osiers or other wood of the country, such as hampers, fruit\r\nbaskets, threshing sledges, mauls and mattocks, or what ever is made\r\nout of the fibre plants like hemp, flax, rushes, palm leaves and\r\nnettles, namely: rope, twine and mats. Those implements which cannot\r\nbe manufactured on the farm should be bought more with reference to\r\ntheir utility than their appearance that they may not diminish your\r\nprofit by useless expense, a result which may be best secured by\r\nbuying where the things you need may be found at once of good quality,\r\nnear at hand and cheap. The requirement of the kind and number of such\r\nimplements is measured by the extent of the farm because the further\r\nyour boundaries lie apart the more work there is to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this connection,\" put in Stolo, \"given the size of the farm, Cato\r\nrecommends with respect to implements as follows: he who cultivates\r\n240 jugera in olives should have five sets of oil making implements,\r\nwhich he enumerates severally, such as the copper utensils, including\r\nkettles, pots, ewers with three spouts, etc.; the implements made out\r\nof wood and iron, including three large wagons, six ploughs with their\r\nshares, four manure carriers, etc. So of the iron tools, what they\r\nare and how many are needed, he speaks in great detail, as eight iron\r\npitch forks, as many hoes and half as many shovels, etc.\r\n\r\n\"In like manner he lays down another formula of implements for a\r\nvineyard, viz.: if you cultivate 100 jugera you should have three sets\r\nof implements for the wine press and also covered storage vats of\r\na capacity of eight hundred _cullei_, as well as twenty harvesting\r\nhampers for grapes and as many for corn, and other things in like\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\n\"Other writers advise a smaller quantity of such conveniences, but I\r\nbelieve Cato prescribed so great a capacity in order that one might\r\nnot be compelled to sell his wine every year, for old wine sells\r\nbetter than new, and the same quality sells better at one time than\r\nanother. Cato writes further in great detail of the kind and number\r\nof iron tools which are required for a vineyard, such as the falx or\r\npruning hook, spades, hoes. So also several of these instruments are\r\nof many varieties, as for instance the falx, of which this author says\r\nthat there must be provided forty of the kind suitable for use in a\r\nvineyard, five for cutting rushes, three for pruning trees and ten for\r\ncutting briers.\"\r\n\r\nSo far Stolo, when Scrofa began again. \"The owner should have an\r\ninventory of all the farm implements and equipment, with a copy on\r\nfile both at the house and at the steading, and it should be the\r\nduty of the overseer to see that everything is checked against this\r\ninventory and is assigned its appropriate keeping place in the barn.\r\nWhat cannot be kept under lock and key should be kept in plain sight,\r\nand this is particularly necessary in respect of the utensils which\r\nare used only at intervals, as at harvest time, like the grape baskets\r\nand such things, for what ever one sees daily is in the least danger\r\nfrom the thief.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3° CONCERNING THE OPERATION OF A FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. \"And now,\" interposed Agrasius, \"as we have discussed the\r\ntwo first parts of the four-fold division of agriculture, namely:\r\nconcerning the farm itself and the implements with which it is worked,\r\nproceed with the third part.\"\r\n\r\n_Of planting field crops_\r\n\r\n\"As I hold,\" said Scrofa, \"that the profit of a farm is that only\r\nwhich comes from sowing the land, there are two considerations which\r\nremain for discussion, what one should sow and where it is most\r\nexpedient to sow it, for some lands are best suited for hay, some for\r\ncorn, some for wine and some for oil. So also should be considered the\r\nforage crops like basil, mixed fodder, vetch, alfalfa, snail clover\r\nand lupines. All things should not be sown in rich land, nor should\r\nthin land be left unsown, for it is better to sow in light soil those\r\nthings which do not require much nourishment, such as snail clover and\r\nthe legumes, except always chick peas (for this also is a legume like\r\nthe other plants which are not reaped but from which the grain is\r\nplucked) because those things which it is the custom to pluck (legere)\r\nare called legumes. In rich land should be sown what ever require\r\nmuch nourishment, such as cabbage, spring and winter, wheat and flax.\r\nCertain plants are cultivated not so much for their immediate yield as\r\nwith forethought for the coming year, because cut and left lying they\r\nimprove the land. So, if land is too thin it is the practice to plough\r\nin for manure, lupines not yet podded, and likewise the field bean, if\r\nit has not yet ripened so that it is fitting to harvest the beans.[81]\r\n\r\n\"Not less should you make provision for cultivating what yields you\r\nprofit in mere pleasure, like arbours and flower gardens: and those\r\nplantations which do not serve either for the support of man or the\r\ndelight of the senses, but are not the less useful in the economy of\r\nthe farm. Thus suitable places must be set aside for growing willows\r\nand reeds and other such things which affect wet places. On the other\r\nhand, you should sow field beans as much as possible in your corn\r\nland. There are other plants which seek dry places, and still others\r\ndemand shade, like asparagus, both when wild and cultivated: while\r\nviolets and garden flowers, which flourish in the sun should be set\r\nout in the open.\r\n\r\n\"So other things demand other planting conditions, like the osiers\r\nfrom which you derive your material for making basket ware, for wagon\r\nframes, winnowing baskets and grape hampers. Elsewhere you might plant\r\nand cultivate a forest for cut wood and a spinney for fowling.\r\n\r\n\"So you should reserve ground for planting hemp, flax, rush and Spanish\r\nbroom (spartum) which serve to make shoes for the cattle, thread,\r\ncord and rope. Other situations are suitable for still other kinds\r\nof planting, as, for example, some plant garden truck and some plant\r\nother things, in a nursery, or between the rows of a young orchard\r\nbefore the roots of the trees have spread far out, but this should\r\nnever be done when the trees have grown lest the roots be injured.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this respect,\" said Stolo, \"what Cato says about planting is in\r\npoint, that a field which is rich and in good heart and without shade\r\nshould be planted in corn, while a low lying field should be set in\r\nturnips, radishes, millet and panic grass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of planting olives_\r\n\r\nXXIV. Scrofa resumed: \"The varieties of olives to plant in rich and\r\nwarm land are the preserving olive _radius major_, the olive of\r\nSallentina, the round _orchis_, the bitter _posea_, the Sergian, the\r\nColminian, and the waxy _albicera_: which ever of these does best in\r\nyour locality, plant that most extensively. An olive yard is not worth\r\ncultivating unless it looks to the west wind and is exposed to the\r\nsun; if the soil is cold and thin there you should plant the Licinian\r\nolive, for if you set out this variety in a rich and warm soil it will\r\nnever make a _hostus_ and the tree will exhaust itself in bearing and\r\nwill become infected with red moss. (_Hostus_ is the country name for\r\nthe yield of oil from a single tree at each _factus_ or pressing: some\r\nclaim this should amount to 160 _modii_, while others reduce it to 120\r\n_modii_, and even less in proportion to the size and number of their\r\nstorage vats.)\r\n\r\n\"Cato advises you to plant elms and poplars around the farm so as to\r\nobtain from them leaves to feed the sheep and cattle as well as a\r\nsupply of lumber: while this is not necessary on all farms, nor in\r\nsome for the forage alone, it may be done with advantage as a wind\r\nbreak against the north where the trees will not shut out the sun.\"\r\n\r\nStolo added the following advice from the same author: 'If you have a\r\npiece of wet ground there plant cuttings of poplars, and also reeds\r\nwhich are set out as follows: having turned the sod with a hoe plant\r\nthe scions of reed three feet one from the other. Wild asparagus (from\r\nwhich you may cultivate garden asparagus) should also be set out in\r\nsuch a place because the same kind of cultivation is suitable for it\r\nas for reeds. You should set out Greek willows around the reed bed to\r\nsupply ties for your vines.'\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of planting vines_\r\n\r\nXXV. \"In respect of planting vines,\" resumed Scrofa, \"it should be\r\nobserved that the varieties fitted for the best land and exposure to\r\nthe sun are the little Aminean, the twin _Eugeneam_ and the little\r\nyellow kind: while on rich or wet land the best varieties are the\r\nlarge Aminean, the Murgentine, the Apician and the Lucanian. Other\r\nvines, and especially the mixed varieties, do well in any kind of\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nXXVI. \"In all vineyards care is taken that the prop should shelter the\r\nvine against the north wind. And if live cypresses are used as props\r\nthey are planted in alternate rows and are not allowed to grow higher\r\nthan is necessary for use as a prop. Cabbages are never planted near\r\nvines because they do each other damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Agrius, turning to Fundanius, \"that the Sacristan may\r\nget back before we have reached the fourth head of our subject, that\r\nof the vintage, for I am looking forward thirstily to the vintage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be of good cheer,\" said Scrofa, \"and prepare the grape baskets and\r\nthe ewer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4° CONCERNING THE AGRICULTURAL SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. We have two standards of time, the first that of the revolution\r\nof the year, because in it the sun completes his circuit, the other\r\nthe measure of the month, because it includes the waxing and the\r\nwaning of the moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the solar measure of the year_\r\n\r\nFirst I will speak of the sun, whose recurring journey is divided with\r\nreference to the pursuits of agriculture into four seasons of three\r\nmonths each, or more accurately into eight seasons of a month and a\r\nhalf each. The four seasons are Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. In\r\nSpring certain crops are sown and the sod fields are broken up,[82]\r\nso that the weeds in them may be destroyed before they have seeded\r\nthemselves again, and the clods, by drying out in the sun, may become\r\nmore accessible to the rain and when broken down by its action easier\r\nto cultivate. Such land should be ploughed not less than twice, but\r\nthree times is better.[83] The Summer is the season of the grain\r\nharvest; the Autumn, when the weather is dry, that of the vintage: and\r\nit is also the fit time for thinning out the woods, when the trees to\r\nbe removed should be cut down close to the ground and the roots should\r\nbe dug up before the first rains to prevent them from stooling. In\r\nWinter the trees may be pruned, provided this is done at a time when\r\nthe bark is free from frost and rain and ice.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. Spring begins when the sun is in Aquarius, Summer when it is\r\nin Taurus, Autumn when it is in Leo, and Winter when it is in Scorpio.\r\nSince the beginning of each of the four seasons is the twenty-third\r\nday after the entrance of the sun in these signs respectively, it\r\nfollows that Spring has ninety-one days, Summer ninety-four, Autumn\r\nninety-one and Winter eighty-nine: which, reduced to the dates of our\r\npresent official calendar,[84] makes the beginning of Spring on the\r\nseventh day before the Ides of February (February 7), of Summer on the\r\nseventh day before the Ides of May (May 9), of Autumn on the third day\r\nbefore the Ides of August (August 11), and of Winter on the fourth day\r\nbefore the Ides of November (November 10).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CALENDAR OF AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a more exact definition of the seasons, the year is divided into\r\neight parts, the first of forty-five days from the date of the rising\r\nof the west wind (February 7) to the date of the vernal equinox (March\r\n24), the second of the ensuing forty-four days to the rising of the\r\nPleiades (May 7), the third of forty-eight days to the summer solstice\r\n(June 24), the fourth of twenty-seven days to the rising of the Dog\r\nStar (July 21), the fifth of sixty-seven days to the Autumn equinox\r\n(September 26), the sixth of thirty-two days to the setting of the\r\nPleiades (October 28), the seventh of fifty-seven days to the winter\r\nsolstice (December 24), and the eighth of forty-five days to the\r\nbeginning of the first.[85]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_1° February 7-March 24_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. These are the things to be done during the first of the seasons\r\nso enumerated: All kinds of nurseries should be set out, the vines\r\nshould be first pruned, then dug, and the roots which have protruded\r\nfrom the ground should be cut out, the meadows should be cleaned,\r\nwillows planted and the corn hoed. We call that corn land (_seges_)\r\nwhich has been ploughed and sowed as distinguished from plough land\r\n(_arva_) which has been ploughed but not yet sowed, while that land\r\nwhich was formerly sowed and lies awaiting a new ploughing is called\r\nstubble (_novalis_). When land is ploughed for the first time it is\r\nsaid to be broken up (_proscindere_), and at the second ploughing to\r\nbe broken down (_offringere_) because at the first ploughing large\r\nclods are turned up and at the second ploughing these are reduced. The\r\nthird cultivation, after the seed has been sown, is called ridging\r\n(_lirare_), that is, when by fastening mould boards on the plough, the\r\nsown seed is covered up in ridges[86] and at the same time furrows are\r\ncut by means of which the surface water may drain off. Some farmers\r\nwho cultivate small farms, as in Apulia, are wont to harrow their land\r\nafter it is ridged, if perchance any large clods have been left in the\r\nseed bed. The hollow channel left by the share of the plough is called\r\nthe furrow, the raised land between two furrows is called the ridge\r\n(_porca_,) because there the seed is as it were laid upon an altar\r\n(_porricere_) to secure a crop, for when the entrails are offered to\r\nthe gods this word _porricere_ is used to describe the oblation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2° _March 24-May 7_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. These are the things to be done during the second season between\r\nthe vernal equinox and the rising of the Pleiades. Weed the corn land,\r\nbreak up old sod, cut the willows, close the pastures (to the stock)\r\nand complete any thing left undone in the preceding season. Plant\r\ntrees before the buds shoot and they begin to blossom, for deciduous\r\ntrees are not fit to transplant after they put forth leaves. Plant and\r\nprune your olives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3° _May 7-June 24_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. These are the things to be done during the third season between\r\nthe rising of the Pleiades and the summer solstice. Dig the young\r\nvines or plough them, and afterwards put the land in good order; that\r\nis to say, fine the soil so that no clods shall remain. This is called\r\nfining the soil (_occare_) because it breaks down (_occidare_) the\r\nclods. Thin out the vines, but let it be done by one who knows\r\nhow, for this operation which is considered of great importance is\r\nperformed only on vines and not on the orchard. To thin a vine is to\r\nselect and reserve the one, two and some times even three best new\r\ntendrils sprung from the stem of the vine, cutting off all the others,\r\nlest the stem may be unable to furnish nourishment for those which\r\nhave been reserved. So in a nursery it is the custom to cut it back\r\nat first so that the vine may grow with a stronger stem and may have\r\ngreater strength to produce fruitful tendrils: for a stem which grows\r\nslender like a rush is sterile through weakness and cannot throw out\r\ntendrils. Thus it is the custom to call a weak stem a flag, and\r\na strong stem, which bears grapes, a palm. The name _flagellum_,\r\nindicating something as unstable as a breeze, is derived from\r\n_flatus_, by the change of a letter, just as in the case of the word\r\n_flabellum_, which means fly fan. The name _palma_, which is given\r\nto those vine shoots which are fruitful in grapes, was it seems, at\r\nfirst, parilema, derived from _parire_ (to produce), whence by a\r\nchange of letters, such as we find in many instances, it came to be\r\ncalled _palma_.\r\n\r\nFrom another part of the vine springs the _capreolus_, which is a\r\nlittle spiral tendril, like a curled hair, by means of which the vine\r\nholds on while it creeps towards the place of which it would take\r\npossession, from which quality of taking hold of things (_capere_) it\r\nis called _capreolus_.\r\n\r\nAll forage crops should be saved at this season; first, basil, then\r\nmixed fodder (_farrago_)[87] and vetch, and last of all the hay. Our\r\nname for basil is _ocinum_, which is derived from the Greek word\r\n[Greek: ocheos] and signifies that it comes quickly, like the pot herb\r\nof the same name. It has this name also because it quickens the action\r\nof the bowels of cattle and so is fed to them as a purgative. It is\r\ncut green from a bean field before the pods are formed. On the other\r\nhand that forage which is cut with a sickle from a field in which\r\nbarley and vetch and other legumes have been sown in mixture for\r\nforage, is called _farrago_ from the instrument (_ferro_) with which\r\nit is cut, or perhaps because it was first sown in the stubble of a\r\nfield of corn (_far_). It is fed to horses and other cattle in the\r\nspring to purge and to fatten them.\r\n\r\nVetch (_vicia_) is so called from its quality of conquering\r\n(_vincire_) because this plant, like the vine, has tendrils by means\r\nof which it creeps twisting upward on the stalks of lupines or other\r\nplants where it clings until it over-tops its host.\r\n\r\nIf you have irrigated meadows, proceed to water them at this season,\r\nas soon as you have saved the hay.\r\n\r\nDuring droughts water your grafted fruit trees every evening. They\r\nprobably derive their name, (_poma_), from their appetite for drink\r\n(_potus_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4° _June 24-July 21_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. During the fourth season between the summer solstice and the\r\nrising of the Dog Star most farmers make their harvest, because it is\r\nclaimed that to mature properly corn should be allowed fifteen days to\r\ngerminate and shoot, fifteen days to bloom and fifteen days to ripen.\r\n\r\nFinish your ploughing: it will be more profitable in proportion as the\r\nearth is ploughed warm, when the land is broken up, fine it, that is,\r\nwork it again in order that all the clods may be reduced, for at the\r\nfirst ploughing large clods are always turned up. This is the time\r\nalso to sow vetch, lentils, the small variety of chick peas, pulse\r\n(_ervilia_) and the other things which we call legumes, but which\r\nothers, as for example the Gauls, call _legarica_, both of which names\r\ncome from the practice of picking their fruit (_legere_) because they\r\nare not cut but gathered.\r\n\r\nWork the old vines a second time and the young ones thrice, especially\r\nif there are any clods left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5° _July 21-September 26_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. During the fifth season between the rising of the Dog Star\r\nand the autumn equinox thresh your straw and rick it, continue the\r\nharrowing of your fallow land, prune your fruit trees, and mow your\r\nirrigated meadow the second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6° _September 26-October 28_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. The authorities advise you to begin to sow at the commencement\r\nof the sixth season immediately after the autumn equinox and to keep\r\nit up for the following 91 days, but not to attempt to sow any thing\r\nafter the winter solstice, unless it is absolutely necessary, because\r\nseed sown before the winter solstice germinates in seven days, while\r\nthat sown later hardly ever sprouts for 40 days.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the authorities say that you should not begin your\r\nsowing before the equinox, lest continued rains cause the seed to rot\r\nin the ground. The best time to plant beans is at the setting of the\r\nPleiades, but gather the grapes and make the vintage between the\r\nequinox and the setting of the Pleiades. Immediately afterward begin\r\nto prune the vines, to propagate them and plant fruit trees, but in\r\nthose regions where the frost comes early it is better to postpone\r\nthese operations until the following spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7° _October 28-December 24._\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. These are the things to do during the seventh season between\r\nthe setting of the Pleiades and the winter solstice. Plant lilies and\r\ncrocuses and propagate roses, which may be done by making cuttings\r\nabout three inches in length from a stem already rooted, set these out\r\nand later, after they have formed their own roots, transplant them.\r\nThe cultivation of violets has no place on a farm because they require\r\nelevated beds for which the soil is scraped up and these are damaged\r\nor even washed away by heavy rains, thus wasting the fertility of the\r\nland. At any time of the year between the rising of the west wind and\r\nthe rising of Arcturus (February-September) it is proper to transplant\r\nfrom the seed beds thyme, an herb, which owes its name, _serpyllum_,\r\nto its creeping habit (_quod serpit_). This is the season also to\r\ndig new ditches, clean the old ones, and to prune the trees in the\r\narbustum and the vines which are married to them, but be careful that\r\nyou suspend most of your work during the fifteen days before and after\r\nthe winter solstice: it is fitting, however, to set out some trees\r\nduring this period, as, for example, elms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8° _December 24-February 7_\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. These are the things to do during the eighth season between the\r\nwinter solstice and the rising of the west wind. Drain the fields, if\r\nany water is standing on them, but if they are dry and the land is\r\nfriable, harrow them. Prune the vines and the orchard. When it is not\r\nfitting to work in the fields then those things should be done which\r\ncan be done under cover during the winter twilight.\r\n\r\nAll these rules should be written out and posted in the farmstead and\r\nthe overseer especially should have them at the tip of his tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the influence of the moon on agriculture_\r\n\r\nXXXVII. The lunar seasons also must be considered. They are divided\r\ninto two terms, that from the new moon to the full, and that from\r\nthe full moon to the next moon, or until that day which we call\r\n_intermenstruus_, or the last and the first of a moon, whence at\r\nAthens this day is called [Greek: henae kai nea] (the old and the\r\nnew), though the other Greeks call it [Greek: triakas] the thirtieth\r\nday. Some agricultural operations may be undertaken with more\r\nadvantage during the increase of the moon, others during the\r\ndecrease,[88] as, for example, the harvest or cutting of wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I observe a practice which I learned from my father,\" said Agrasius,\r\n\"not only never to shear my sheep, but not even to have my own hair\r\ncut on the decrease of the moon, for fear that I might become bald.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are the quarters of the moon,\" said Agrius, \"and what bearing\r\nhave they on agriculture?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you never heard in the country,\" said Tremelius, \"the lore about\r\nthe influence of Jana (Diana) on the eighth day before her waxing, and\r\nagain on the eighth day before her waning; how certain things which\r\nought to be done during the increase can be done to better advantage\r\nin the second quarter than the first, and that what ever is fitting to\r\ndo on the wane of the moon can be better done when her light is less?\r\nThis is all I know about the effect of the four quarters of the moon\r\nupon agriculture.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER CALENDAR OF SIX AGRICULTURAL SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There is another division of the year,\" said Stolo, \"which takes\r\naccount of both the sun and the moon, namely: into six seasons,\r\nbecause almost all the cultivated fruits of the earth come to maturity\r\nand reach the vat or the granary after five successive agricultural\r\noperations and are put to use by a sixth, and these are, first, the\r\npreparing (_praeparandum_); second, the planting (_serendum_); third,\r\nthe cultivating of the growing crop (_nutricandum_); fourth, the\r\ningathering (_legendum_); fifth, the storing (_condendum_), and sixth,\r\nthe consuming (_promendum_).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1° PREPARING TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of tillage_\r\n\r\nIn the matter of preparation there are different things to be done for\r\ndifferent crops, as, if you wish to make an orchard or an arbustum,\r\nyou trench and grub and plough; if you plant grain, you plough and\r\nharrow; while, if you cultivate trees, you mulch their roots by\r\nbreaking the earth with a mattock, more or less according to the\r\nnature of the tree, for some trees, like the cypress, have a small,\r\nand others like the plane tree have a large, root system (for example,\r\nthat in the Lyceum at Athens described by Theophastus, which, when\r\nit was still a young tree, had a spread of roots to the extent of 33\r\ncubits). If you break the ground with a plough and cattle, it is well\r\nto work the land a second time before you sow your seed. So, if you\r\nare making a meadow the preparation is to close it to the stock, and\r\nthis is usually done when the pear tree is in bloom: if it is an\r\nirrigated meadow the preparation is to turn in the water at the proper\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of manuring_\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. As part of this same operation should be considered what\r\nplaces in a field need manure and what kind of manure you can use\r\nto the greatest advantage, for the several kinds have different\r\nqualities. Cassius says that the best manure is that of birds, except\r\nswamp and sea birds,[89] but the best of all is, he claims, the manure\r\nof pigeons because it is the hottest and causes the land to ferment.\r\nThis ought to be sown on the land like seed, not distributed in heaps\r\nlike the dung of cattle. I myself think the best manure is that from\r\naviaries in which thrushes and blackbirds are kept, because it is not\r\nonly good for the land but serves as a fattening food for cattle and\r\nhogs: for which reason those who farm aviaries pay less rent when the\r\nowner stipulates that the manure is to be used on the farm, than those\r\nto whom it is a perquisite. Cassius advises that the manure next in\r\nvalue to that of doves is human feces, and third that of goats and\r\nsheep and asses. The manure of horses is of the least value on corn\r\nland, but on meadows it is the best, because, like the manure of other\r\ndraught animals fed on barley, it brings a heavy stand of grass. The\r\nmanure pit should be near the barn in order that it may be available\r\nwith the least labour. If you plant a stake of oak wood in the manure\r\npit it will not harbour serpents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2° PLANTING TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the four methods of propagating plants_\r\n\r\nXXXIX. The second operation, namely that of propagating, must be\r\nconsidered in relation to the proper time for sowing each kind of\r\nseed, for this concerns the aspect of the field you are to sow and the\r\nseason fitting for what you are to plant. Do we not see some things\r\ngrow best in the spring, others in summer, some in autumn, and others\r\nagain in winter? For each plant is sowed or propagated or harvested in\r\nseason according to its nature: so while most trees are grafted most\r\nsuccessfully in spring, rather than the autumn, yet figs may be\r\ngrafted at the summer solstice, and cherries even in winter.\r\n\r\nAnd since there are four methods of propagation of plants, by nature\r\nand by the several processes of art, namely: transplanting from one\r\nplace to another, as is done in layering vines, what is called cuttage\r\nor propagating quick sets cut from trees, and graftage, which consists\r\nin transferring scions from one tree to another, let us consider at\r\nwhat season and in what locality you should do each of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. Seeding, and here of seed selection_\r\n\r\nXL. In the first place, the seed, which is the principle of all\r\ngermination, is of two kinds, that which is not appreciable by\r\nour senses and that which is. Seed is hidden from us when it is\r\ndisseminated in the air, as the physicist Anaxagoras holds, or is\r\ndistributed over the land by the surface water, as Theophrastus\r\nmaintains. The seeds which the farmer can see should be studied with\r\nthe greatest care. There are some varieties, like that of the cypress,\r\nwhich are so small as to be almost invisible, for those nuts which the\r\ncypress bears, that look like little balls covered with bark, are not\r\nthe seed but contain it. Nature gave the principle of germination to\r\nseed, the rest of agriculture was left for the experience of man to\r\ndiscover, for in the beginning before the interference of man plants\r\nwere generated before they were sown, afterwards those seeds which\r\nwere collected by man from the original plants did not generate until\r\nafter they had been sown.\r\n\r\nSeed should be examined to ascertain that it is not sterile by age,\r\nthat it is clean, particularly that it is not adulterated with other\r\nvarieties of similar appearances: for age has such effect upon seed as\r\nin some respects to change its very nature, thus it is said that rape\r\nwill grow from old cabbage seed, and vice versa.[90]\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. Transplanting_\r\n\r\nIn respect of transplanting, care should be taken that it is\r\ndone neither too soon nor too late. The fit time, according to\r\nTheophrastus, is spring and autumn and midsummer, but the same rule\r\nwill not apply in all places and to all kinds of plants: for in dry\r\nand thin clay soil, which has little natural moisture, the wet spring\r\nis the time, but in a rich and fat soil it is safe to transplant in\r\nautumn. Some limit the practice of transplanting to a period of thirty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c. Cuttage_\r\n\r\nIn respect of cuttage, which consists in planting in the ground a live\r\ncutting from a tree, it behooves you especially to see that this is\r\ndone at the proper time, which is before the tree has begun to bud or\r\nbloom: that you take off the cutting carefully rather than break\r\nit from the parent tree, because the cutting will be more firmly\r\nestablished in proportion as it has a broad footing which can readily\r\nput out roots: and that it is planted promptly before the sap dries\r\nout of it.\r\n\r\nIn propagating olives select a truncheon of new grown wood about\r\na foot in length and the same size at each end: some call these\r\n_clavolae_ and others call them _taleae_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d. Graftage_\r\n\r\nIn respect of graftage, which consists in transferring growing wood\r\nfrom one tree to another, care must be taken in selecting the tree\r\nfrom which the scion is taken, the tree on which it is grafted, and\r\nthe time and the manner in which it is done: for the pear cannot\r\nbe grafted on an oak, even though it may upon the apple. In this\r\noperation many men who have great faith in the sayings of the\r\nsoothsayers give heed to their warning that as many kinds of grafts\r\nthere may be on a tree so many bolts of lightning will strike it,\r\nbecause a bolt of lightning is generated by each graft (_ictu_).[91]\r\n\r\nIf you graft a cultivated pear upon a wild pear tree no matter how\r\ngood it may be, the result will not be as fortunate as if you had\r\ngrafted on another cultivated pear. Having regard for the result, on\r\nwhat ever kind of tree you graft, if it is of exactly the same kind,\r\nas, for instance, apple on apple, you should take care that the scion\r\ncomes from a better tree than that on which it is grafted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_e. A \"new\" method--inarching_\r\n\r\nThere is another operation recently suggested,[92] for propagating one\r\ntree from another, when the trees are neighbours. From the tree from\r\nwhich you wish to take a scion a branch is trained to that on which\r\nyou wish to make the graft and the scion is bound upon an incision in\r\na branch of the stock. The place of contact of both scion and stock is\r\ncut away with a knife so that the bark of one joins evenly with the\r\nbark of the other at the point of exposure to the weather. Care\r\nshould be taken that the growing top of the scion is pointed straight\r\nupwards. The following year when the graft has knitted, the scion may\r\nbe cut from its parent tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of when to use these different methods_\r\n\r\nXLI. The most important consideration in propagating is, however, the\r\ntime at which you do it: thus things which formerly were propagated in\r\nthe spring now are propagated in summer, like the fig, whose wood is\r\nnot heavy and so craves heat, as a consequence of which quality\r\nfigs cannot be grown in cold climates. For the same reason water is\r\ndangerous to a new fig graft because its soft wood rots easily. For\r\nthese reasons it is now considered that midsummer is the best season\r\nto propagate figs. On the other hand it is the custom to tie a pot\r\nof water above a graft of hard wood trees so that it may drip on\r\nthe graft and prevent the scion from drying up before it has been\r\nincorporated with the stock. Care must be taken that the bark of the\r\nscion is kept intact, and to that end it should be sharpened but so\r\nthat the pith (_medulla_) is not exposed. To prevent the rain or the\r\nheat from injuring it from without, it should be smeared with clay and\r\nbound with bark. It is customary to take off the scion of a vine three\r\ndays before it is to be grafted so that the superfluity of moisture\r\nmay drain out before the scion is inserted, or, if the graft is\r\nalready in place, an incision is made in the stock a little below the\r\ngraft from which the adventitious moisture may drain off: but this\r\nis not done with figs and pomegranates, for in all trees of a\r\ncomparatively dry nature the graft is made immediately. Indeed, some\r\ntrees, like the fig, are best grafted when the scion is in bud.\r\n\r\nOf the four kinds of propagation which I have discussed, that of\r\ngraftage is preferred in respect of those trees which, like the fig,\r\nare slow in developing: for the natural seeds of the fig are those\r\ngrains seen in the fruit we eat and are so small as scarcely to be\r\ncapable of sprouting the slenderest shoots. For all seeds which are\r\nsmall and hard are slow in germinating, while those which are soft are\r\nmore spontaneous, just as girls grow faster than boys. Thus by reason\r\nof their feminine tenderness the fig, the pomegranate and the vine are\r\nquicker to mature than the palm, the cypress and the olive, which are\r\nrather dry than humid by nature. Wherefore we some times propagate\r\nfigs in nurseries from cuttings rather than attempt to raise them from\r\nseed: unless there is no other way to secure them, as happens when one\r\nwishes to send or receive seed across the sea. For this purpose the\r\nripe figs which we eat are strung together and when they have dried\r\nout are packed and shipped wheresoever we wish, and thereafter being\r\nplanted in a nursery they germinate. In this way the Chian, the\r\nChalcidian, the Lydian, the African and other foreign varieties of\r\nfigs were imported into Italy.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason olives are usually propagated in nurseries from\r\ntruncheons such as I have described, rather than from its seed, which\r\nis hard like a nut and slow to germinate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of seeding alfalfa_\r\n\r\nXLII. You should take care not to plant alfalfa[93] in soil which is\r\neither too dry or half wet,[94] but in good order. The authorities say\r\nthat if the soil is in proper condition a _modius_ (peck) and a half\r\nof alfalfa seed will suffice to sow a _jugerum_ of land. This seed is\r\nsowed broad-cast on the land like grass and grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of seeding clover and cabbage_\r\n\r\nXLIII. Snail clover (_cytisus_) and cabbage is sowed in beds well\r\nprepared and is transplanted from them and set out so that the plants\r\nare a foot and a half apart, also cuttings are taken from the stronger\r\nplants and set out like those which were raised from seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of seeding grain_\r\n\r\nXLIV. The quantity of seed required for one _jugerum_ is, of beans,\r\nfour modii, of wheat five modii, of barley six modii, and of spelt ten\r\nmodii: in some places a little more or a little less; if the soil is\r\nrich, more; if it is thin, less. Wherefore you should observe how much\r\nit is the custom to sow in your locality in order that you may do what\r\nthe region and the quality of the soil demands, which is the more\r\nnecessary as the same amount of seed will yield in some localities ten\r\nfor one, and in others fifteen for one, as in Etruria. In Italy also,\r\nin the region of Sybaris it is said that seed yields as much as one\r\nhundred for one, and as much is claimed for the soil of Syria at\r\nGadara, and in Africa at Byzacium.[95]\r\n\r\nIt is also important to consider whether you will sow in land which\r\nis cropped every year which we call _restibilis_, or in fallow land\r\n(_vervactum_), which is [ploughed in the spring and so] allowed an\r\ninterval of rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Olynthia,\" said Agrius, \"they are said to crop the land every year\r\nbut to get a greater yield every third year.\"\r\n\r\n\"A field ought to lie fallow every other year,\" said Stolo, \"or at\r\nleast be planted with some crop which makes less demand upon the\r\nsoil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3° CULTIVATING TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Tell us,\" said Agrius, \"about the third operation which relates to\r\nthe cultivation and the nourishment of the crops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the conditions of plant growth_\r\n\r\n\"All things which germinate in the soil,\" replied Licinius, \"in the\r\nsoil also are nourished, come to maturity, conceive, are pregnant and\r\nin due time bear fruit or ear, so each fruit after its kind yields\r\nseed similar to that from which it is sprung. Thus if you pluck a\r\nblossom or a green pear from a pear tree, or the like from any other\r\ntree, nothing will grow again in that place during the same year,\r\nbecause a tree cannot have two periods of fruition in the same season.\r\nThey produce only as women bear children, when their time has come.\"\r\n\r\nXLV. Barley usually sprouts in seven days after it has been sowed, and\r\nwheat not much later, while the legumes almost always sprout in four\r\nor five days, except the bean, which is somewhat later. Millet and\r\nsesame and the other similar grains sprout in the same time unless\r\nsome thing in the nature of the soil or the weather retards them. If\r\nthe locality is cold, those plants which are propagated in the nursery\r\nand are tender by nature ought to be protected from the frosts by\r\ncoverings of leaves or straw, and, if rains follow, care should be\r\ntaken that water is not permitted to stand any where about them, for\r\nice is a poison to tender roots under ground, as to sprouts above, and\r\nprevents them from developing normally. In autumn and winter the\r\nroots develop more than does the leaf of the plant because they are\r\nnourished by the warmth of the roof of earth, while the leaf above is\r\ncut down by the frosty air. We can learn this by observation of the\r\nwild vegetation which grows without the intervention of man, for the\r\nroots grow more rapidly than that which springs from them, but only so\r\nfar as they are actuated by the rays of the sun. There are two causes\r\nof the growth of roots, the vitality of the root itself by which\r\nnature drives it forward, and the quality of the soil which yields a\r\npassage more easily in some conditions than in others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the mechanical action of plants_\r\n\r\nXLVI. In their effect upon plants such natural forces as I have\r\nmentioned produce some curious mechanical results. Thus it is possible\r\nto determine the time of the year from the motion of the leaves of\r\ncertain trees like the olive, the white poplar and the willow, for\r\nwhen the summer solstice has arrived their leaves turn over. Not less\r\ncurious is the habit of that flower which is called the heliotrope,\r\nwhich in the morning looks upon the rising sun and, following its\r\njourney to its setting, never turns away its face.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the protection of nurseries and meadows_\r\n\r\nXLVII. Those plants, which, like olives and figs, are grown in the\r\nnursery from cuttings and are of a tender nature, should be protected\r\nby sheds built of two planks fastened at each end: moreover they\r\nshould be weeded, and this should be done while the weeds are still\r\nyoung, for after they have become dry they offer resistance, and more\r\nreadily break off in your hand than yield to your pull. On the other\r\nhand the grass which springs in the meadows and gives you hope of\r\nforage not only should not be rooted out while it is growing, but\r\nshould not even be walked upon; hence both the flock and the herd\r\nshould be excluded from the meadow at this time and even man himself\r\nshould keep away, for grass disappears under the foot and the track\r\nsoon becomes a path.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the structure of a wheat plant_\r\n\r\nXLVIII. A corn plant consists of a culm bearing at its head a spike,\r\nwhich, when it is not mutilated, has, as in barley and wheat, three\r\nparts, namely: the grain, the glume and the beard, not to speak of the\r\nsheath which contains the spike while it is being formed. The grain is\r\nthat solid interior part of the spike, the glume is its hull and the\r\nbeard those long thin needles which grow out of the glume. Thus as the\r\nglume is the pontifical robe of the grain, the beard is its apex. The\r\nbeard and the grain are well known to almost every one, but the glume\r\nto very few: indeed I know only one book in which it is mentioned,\r\nthe translation which Ennius made of the verses of Evhemerus. The\r\netymology of the word _gluma_ seems to be from _glubere_, to strip,\r\nbecause the grain must be stripped from this hull: and by a like\r\nderivation the hull of the fig which we eat is called a glume. The\r\nbeard we call _arista_ because it is the first part of the corn to dry\r\n(_arescere_), while we call the grain _granum_ from the fact that it\r\nis produced (_gerere_), for we plant corn to produce grain, not glumes\r\nor beards, just as vines are planted to produce grapes, not tendrils.\r\nThe spike, which, by tradition, the country people call _speca_, seems\r\nto get its name from _spes_, hope. For men plant with hope of the\r\nharvest. A spike which has no beard is called polled (_muticus_), for,\r\nwhen the spike is first forming, the beard, like the horns of a young\r\nanimal, is not apparent but lies hid like a sword in its scabbard\r\nunder a wrapping of foliage which hence is called the sheath. When the\r\nspike is mature its taper end above the grain is called the _frit_,\r\nwhile that below, where the spike joins the straw culm, is called the\r\n_urruncum_.\r\n\r\nXLIX. When Stolo drew breath, no one asked any questions, and so,\r\nbelieving that enough had been said on the subject of the care of the\r\ngrowing crops, he resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4° HARVEST TIME\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will now speak about the gathering of the crops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the hay harvest_\r\n\r\nAnd first of the meadows: when the grass ceases to grow and begins to\r\ndry out with the heat, then it should be cut with scythes and, as it\r\nbegins to cure, turned with forks. When it is cured it should be tied\r\nin bales and hauled into the steading; then what hay was left lying\r\nshould be raked together and stacked, and, finally, when this has all\r\nbeen done, the meadow should be gleaned, that is, gone over with the\r\nsickle to save what ever grass escaped the mowing, such as that left\r\nstanding on tussocks. From this act of cutting (_sectare_) I think\r\nthat the word _sicilire_ (to glean with a sickle) is derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the wheat harvest_\r\n\r\nL. The word harvest (_messis_) is properly used with respect to the\r\ningathering of those crops which are reaped, and from this action\r\n(_metere_) its name is derived, but it is mostly used in respect of\r\ncorn. There are three methods of harvesting corn, one as in Umbria,\r\nwhere they cradle the straw close to the earth and shock up the\r\nsheaves as they are cut: when a sufficient number of shocks has been\r\nmade, they go over them again and cut each sheaf between the spikes\r\nand the straw, the spikes being thrown into baskets and sent off to\r\nthe threshing floor, while the straw is left in the field and stacked.\r\nA second method of harvesting is practised in Picenum, where they have\r\na curved wooden header[96] on the edge of which is fixed an iron saw:\r\nwhen this instrument engages the spikes of grain it cuts them off,\r\nleaving the straw standing in the field, where it is afterwards cut. A\r\nthird method of harvesting, which is used in the vicinity of Rome and\r\nin most places, is to cut the straw in the middle and take away the\r\nupper part with the left hand (whence the word to reap [_metere_] is,\r\nI think, derived from the word _medium_--connoting a cutting in the\r\nmiddle). The lower part of the straw which remains standing is cut\r\nlater,[97] while the rest, which goes with the grain, is hauled off in\r\nbaskets to the threshing floor and there in an airy place is winnowed\r\nwith a shovel (_pala_) from which perhaps the chaff (_palea_) takes\r\nits name. Some derive the name of straw (_stramentum_) from the fact\r\nthat it stands (_stare_), as they think the word _stamen_ is also\r\nderived, while others derive it from the fact that it is spread\r\n(_strare_), because straw is used as litter for cattle.\r\n\r\nThe grain should be harvested when it is ripe: it is considered that\r\nunder normal conditions and in an easy field one man should reap\r\nalmost a jugerum a day and still have time to carry the grain in\r\nbaskets to the threshing floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The threshing floor_\r\n\r\nLI. The threshing floor should be on high ground so that the wind can\r\nblow upon it from all directions. It should be constructed of a size\r\nproportioned to your crops, preferably round and with the centre\r\nslightly raised so that if it rains the water may not stand on it but\r\ndrain off as quickly as possible, and there is no shorter distance\r\nfrom the centre to the circumference of a circle than a radius:[98] it\r\nshould be paved with well packed earth, best of all of clay, so that\r\nit may not crack in the sun and open honeycombs in which the grain can\r\nhide itself, and water collect and give vent to the burrows of mice\r\nand ants. It is the practice to anoint the threshing floor with\r\namurca,[99] for that is an enemy of grass and a poison to ants and to\r\nmoles. Some build up and even pave their threshing floor with rock to\r\nmake it permanent, and some, like the people of Bagiennae, even roof\r\nit over because in that country storms are prevalent at the threshing\r\nseason. In a hot country where the threshing floor is uncovered it is\r\ndesirable to build a shelter near by where the hands can resort in the\r\nheat of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Threshing and winnowing_\r\n\r\nLII. The heaviest and best of the sheaves should be selected on the\r\nthreshing floor and the spikes laid aside for seed. The grain is\r\nthreshed from the spikes on the threshing floor, an operation which\r\nsome perform by means of a sledge drawn by a yoke of oxen: this sledge\r\nconsisting of a wooden platform, studded underneath with flints or\r\niron spikes, on which either the driver rides or some heavy weight is\r\nimposed in order, as it is drawn around, to separate the grain from\r\nthe chaff: others use for this purpose what is called the punic cart,\r\nconsisting of a series of axle trees, equipped with toothed rollers,\r\non which some one sits and drives the cattle which draw it, as they do\r\nin hither Spain and other places. Others cause the grain to be trodden\r\nout under the hoofs of a herd of driven cattle, which are kept moving\r\nby goading them with long poles.\r\n\r\nWhen the grain has been threshed it should be tossed from the ground\r\nby means of a winnowing basket or a winnowing shovel when the wind is\r\nblowing gently, and this is done in such way that the lightest part,\r\nwhich is called the chaff, is blown away beyond the threshing floor,\r\nwhile the heavy part, which is the corn, comes clean into the\r\nbasket.[100]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gleaning_\r\n\r\nLIII. After the harvest is over the grain fields should be gleaned of\r\nshattered grain, and the straw left in the field should be gathered\r\nand housed, but if there is little to be gained by such work, and the\r\nexpense is disproportionate, the stubble should be grazed: for in\r\nfarming it is of the greatest importance that the expense of an\r\noperation shall not exceed the return from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the vintage_\r\n\r\nLIV. In vineyards the vintage should begin when the grape is ripe, but\r\ncare must be taken with what kind of grapes and in what part of the\r\nvineyard you begin: for the early grapes and the mixed variety, which\r\nis called black, ripen some time before the others and should be\r\ngathered first, like the fruit grown on the side of the arbustum, or\r\nof the vineyard, which is exposed to the sun. During the gathering\r\nthose grapes from which you expect to make wine should be separated\r\nfrom those reserved for the table: the choicer being carried to the\r\nwine press and collected in empty jars, while those reserved to eat\r\nare collected in separate baskets, transferred to little pots and\r\nstored in jars packed with marc, though some are immersed in the pond\r\nin jars daubed with pitch and some raised to a shelf in the store\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe stems and the skins of the grapes which have been trodden out\r\nshould be put under the press so that any must left in them may be\r\nadded to the supply in the vat. When this marc ceases to yield a flow,\r\nit is chopped with a knife and pressed again, and the must expressed\r\nby this final operation is hence called _circumcisitum_[101] and is kept\r\nby itself because it smacks of the knife. The marc finally remaining\r\nis thrown into jars, to which water is added, thus preparing a drink\r\nwhich is called after-wine or grape juice, and is given to the hands\r\nin the winter instead of wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the olive harvest_\r\n\r\nLV. And now of the harvest of the olive yard.[102] You should pick by\r\nhand, rather than beat from the tree, all the olives which can be\r\nreached from the ground or from a ladder, because this fruit becomes\r\narid when it has been struck and does not yield so much oil: and in\r\npicking by hand it is better to do so with the bare fingers rather\r\nthan with a tool because the texture of a tool not only injures the\r\nberry but barks the branches and leaves them exposed to the frost. So\r\nit is better to use a reed than a pole to strike down the fruit which\r\ncannot be reached by hand, for (as the proverb is) the heavier the\r\nblow, the more need there is for a surgeon. He who beats his trees\r\nshould beware of doing injury, for often an olive when it is struck\r\naway brings down with it from the branch a twig, and when this happens\r\nthe fruit of the following year is lost: and this is not the least\r\nreason why it is said that the olive bears fruit, or much fruit, only\r\nevery other year.\r\n\r\nLike the grape, the olive serves a two-fold function after it is\r\ngathered. Some are set aside to be eaten and the rest are made into\r\noil, which comforts the body of man not only within but without, for\r\nit follows us into the bath and the gymnasium. Those berries from\r\nwhich it is proposed to make oil are usually stored in heaps on tables\r\nfor several days where they may mellow a little. Each heap in turn is\r\ncarried in crates to the oil jars and to the _trapetus_, or pressing\r\nmill, which is equipped with both hard and rough stones. If the olives\r\nare left too long in the heap they heat and spoil and the oil is\r\nrancid, so if you are unable to grind promptly the heaps of olives\r\nshould be ventilated by moving them. The yield of the olive is of two\r\nkinds, oil which is well known and _amurca_, of the use of which many\r\nare so ignorant that one can often see it streaming from the mill and\r\nwasting upon the ground where it not only discolours the soil, but\r\nin places where it collects even makes it sterile: while if applied\r\nintelligently it has many uses of the greatest importance to\r\nagriculture, as, for instance, by pouring it around the roots of\r\ntrees, chiefly the olive itself, or wherever it is desired to destroy\r\nweeds.[103]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_5° HOUSING TIME_\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. \"Up to this moment,\" cried Agrius, \"I have been sitting in the\r\nbarn with the keys in my hands waiting for you, Stolo, to bring in the\r\nharvest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lo, I am here at the threshold,\" replied Stolo. \"Open the gates for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of storing hay_\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is better to house your hay than to leave it\r\nstacked in the field, for thus it makes more palatable provender, as\r\nmay be proven by putting both kinds before the cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of storing grain_\r\n\r\nLVII. But corn should be stored in an elevated granary, exposed to the\r\nwinds from the east and the north, and where no damp air may reach it\r\nfrom places near at hand. The walls and the floors should be plastered\r\nwith a stucco of marble dust or at least with a mixture of clay and\r\nchaff and amurca, for amurca will serve to keep out mice and weevil\r\nand will make the grain solid and heavy. Some men even sprinkle their\r\ngrain with amurca in the proportion of a quadrantal to every thousand\r\nmodii of grain: others crumble or scatter over it, for the same\r\npurpose, other vermifuges like Chalcidian or Carian chalk or wormwood,\r\nand other things of that kind. Some farmers have their granaries under\r\nground, like caverns, which they call silos, as in Cappadocia and\r\nThrace, while in hither Spain, in the vicinity of Carthage, and at\r\nOsca pits are used for this purpose, the bottoms of which are covered\r\nwith straw: and they take care that neither moisture nor air has\r\naccess to them, except when they are opened for use, a wise precaution\r\nbecause where the air does not move the weevil will not hatch. Corn\r\nstored in this way is preserved for fifty years, and millet, indeed,\r\nfor more than a century.\r\n\r\nOn the ether hand again, in hither Spain and in certain parts of\r\nApulia they build elevated granaries above ground, which the winds\r\nkeep cool, not only by windows at the sides but also from underneath\r\nthe floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of storing legumes_\r\n\r\nLVIII. Beans and other legumes keep safe a long time in oil jars\r\ncovered with ashes. Cato says the little Aminnean grape, as well as\r\nthe large variety and that called Apician, keep very well when buried\r\nin earthen pots: or they may be preserved quite as well in boiled new\r\nwine, or in fresh after-wine. The varieties which keep best when hung\r\nup are the hard grapes and those known as the Aminnean Scantian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of storing pome fruits_\r\n\r\nLIX. The pome fruits, like the preserving sparrow apples, quinces\r\nand the varieties of apples known as Scantian, and 'little rounds'\r\n(_orbiculata_) and those which formerly were called winesap\r\n(_mustea_), and now are called honey apples (_melimela_), can all be\r\nkept safely in a cold and dry place when laid on straw, and so those\r\nwho build fruit houses take care to have the windows give upon the\r\nnorth wind and that it may blow through them: but they should not\r\nbe left without shutters for fear that the fruits should lose their\r\nmoisture and become shrivelled by the effect of the continuous wind.\r\n\r\nThe vaults, the walls and the pavements of these fruiteries are\r\nusually laid in stucco to keep them cool: thus rendering them such\r\npleasant resorts that some men even spread there their dining couches:\r\nas well they may, for if the pursuit of luxury impels some of us to\r\nturn our dining rooms into picture galleries in order to regale even\r\nour eyes with works of art [while we eat], should we not find still\r\ngreater gratification in contemplating the works of nature displayed\r\nin a savory array of beautiful fruits, especially if this was not\r\nprocured, as has been done, by setting up in your fruitery on the\r\noccasion of a party a supply of fruit purchased for the purpose in\r\ntown?\r\n\r\nSome think best to dispose their apples in the fruitery on concrete\r\ntables, others on beds of straw, and some even on flocks of wool.\r\n\r\nPomegranates are preserved by sticking their twigs in jars of sand,\r\nquinces and sparrow apples are strung together and hung up, but the\r\nlate maturing Anician pears are best preserved in boiled must. Sorbs\r\nand pears also are some times cut up and dried in the sun, though the\r\nsorb may be easily preserved intact by keeping them in a dry place:\r\nturnips are cut up and preserved in mustard, while walnuts keep well\r\nin sand, as I have explained with respect to ripe pomegranates. There\r\nis a similar way of ripening pomegranates: put the fruit, while it is\r\nstill green and attached to its branch, in a pot without a bottom,\r\nbury this in the earth and scrape the soil around the protruding\r\nbranch so as to keep out the air, and when the pomegranates are dug up\r\nthey will be found to be not only intact but larger than if they had\r\nhung all the time on the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of storing olives_\r\n\r\nLX. With respect to preserving olives, Cato advises that table olives,\r\nboth the round and the bitter berried kinds, keep best in brine both\r\nwhen they are dry and when they are green, but if they are bruised it\r\nis well to put them in mastich oil. Round olives will retain their\r\nblack colour if they are packed in salt for five days, and then, the\r\nsalt having been brushed away, are exposed for two days in the sun: or\r\nthey may be preserved in must boiled down to one-third, without the\r\nuse of salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of storing amurca_\r\n\r\nLXI. Experienced farmers do well to save their amurca as they do their\r\noil and their wine. The method of preserving it is this: immediately\r\nafter the oil has been pressed out, draw off the amurca and boil it\r\ndown to one-third and, when it has cooled, store it in vats. There are\r\nother methods also, as that in which must is mingled with the amurca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6° CONSUMING TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII. Since no one stores his crops except to bring them out again, it\r\nremains to make a few observations upon the sixth and last operation\r\nin our round of agriculture.\r\n\r\nCrops which have been stored are brought out either to care for them,\r\nto consume them or to sell them, and as all crops are not alike there\r\nare different times for caring for them and for consuming them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of cleaning grain_\r\n\r\nLXIII. Grain is taken out of store to be cleaned, when the weevil\r\nbegins to damage it. When this is apparent the grain should be laid\r\nout in the sun and bowls of water placed nearby and the weevil will\r\nswarm on this water and drown themselves. Those who store their grain\r\nin the pits which are called silos should not attempt to bring out the\r\ngrain for some time after the silo has been opened because there is\r\ndanger of suffocation in entering a recently opened silo. The corn\r\nwhich, during the harvest time, you stored in the ear and which you\r\ncontemplate using for food, should be brought out during the winter to\r\nbe crushed and ground in the grist mill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of condensing amurca_\r\n\r\nLXIV. When it flows from the oil mill, amurca is a watery fluid full\r\nof dregs. It is the custom to store it in this state in earthen jars\r\nand fifteen days later to skim off the scum from the top and transfer\r\nthis to other jars, an operation which is repeated at regular\r\nintervals twelve times during the following six months, taking care\r\nthat the last skimming is done on the wane of the moon. Then it\r\nis boiled in a copper kettle over a slow fire until it is reduced\r\ntwo-thirds, when it may be drawn off for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of racking wine_\r\n\r\nLXV. When the must is stored in the vat to make wine, it should not be\r\nracked off while it is fermenting nor until this process has advanced\r\nso far that the wine may be considered to be made. If you wish to\r\ndrink old wine, it is not made until a year is completed; when it is a\r\nyear old, then draw it out. But if your vineyard contains that kind\r\nof grape which turns sour early, you should eat the fruit, or sell it\r\nbefore the succeeding vintage. There are kinds of wine, like that of\r\nFalernum, which improve the longer you keep them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of preserved olives_\r\n\r\nLXVI. If you attempt to eat white olives immediately after you have\r\nput them up and before they are cured your palate will reject them on\r\naccount of their bitterness (and the same is true of the black olive)\r\nunless you dip them in salt to make them palatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of nuts, dates and figs_\r\n\r\nLXVII. The sooner you use nuts, dates and figs after they have been\r\nstored, the more palatable they will be, for by keeping figs lose\r\ntheir flavour, dates rot and nuts dry up.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of stored fruits_\r\n\r\nLXVIII. Fruits which are strung, such as grapes, apples and sorbs show\r\nby their appearance when they may be taken down for use, for by their\r\nchange of colour and shrinking they reveal themselves as destined to\r\nthe garbage pile unless they are eaten in time. Sorbs which have been\r\nlaid by when they are already dead-ripe should be used promptly, but\r\nthose which were picked green are slower to decay: for green fruit in\r\nthe store house must there go through the process of ripening which\r\nwas denied it on the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of marketing grain_\r\n\r\nLXIX. The spelt which you wish to have prepared for food should be\r\ntaken out in the winter to be ground in the mill: but your seed corn\r\nshould not be taken out until the fields are ready to receive it, a\r\nrule which obtains in respect of all kinds of seed. What you have for\r\nsale should be taken out at the appropriate time also, for some things\r\nwhich cannot be kept long without spoiling should be taken out and\r\nsold promptly, while others which keep should be retained so that you\r\nmay sell when the price is high, for often commodities which are kept\r\non hand a long time, will, if put on the market at the proper time,\r\nnot only yield interest for the time you held them but even a double\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nAs Stolo was speaking, the freedman of the Sacristan ran up to us with\r\nhis eyes full of tears and, begging our pardon for having kept us\r\nwaiting so long, invited us to come to the funeral on the following\r\nday. We all sprang up and cried out together \"What? To the funeral?\r\nWhose funeral? What has happened?\"\r\n\r\nThe freedman, weeping, told us that his master had been struck down by\r\na blow with a knife, but who did it he had been unable to discover by\r\nreason of the crowd, all that he heard being an exclamation that a\r\nmistake had been made. He added that when he had carried his master\r\nhome and had sent the servants to call a doctor, whom they brought\r\nback with them quickly, he trusted that it might seem reasonable to\r\nus that he had waited to attend upon the doctor rather than come to\r\nnotify us at once, and while he had not been able to be of any service\r\nto his master, who had given up the ghost in a few minutes, yet he\r\nhoped we might approve his conduct.\r\n\r\nAccepting these excuses as amply justified, we descended from the\r\ntemple bewildered more by the hazard of human life than surprised that\r\nsuch a fate should be possible at Rome:[104] and so we went our several\r\nways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\nTHE HUSBANDRY OF LIVE STOCK\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction: the decay of country life_\r\n\r\n\r\nThose great men our ancestors did well to esteem the Romans who lived\r\nin the country above those who dwelt in town. For as our peasants\r\ntoday contemn the tenant of a villa as an idler in comparison with the\r\nbusy life of an agricultural labourer, so our ancestors regarded the\r\nsedentary occupations of the town as waste of time from their habitual\r\nrural pursuits: and in consequence they so divided their time that\r\nthey might have to devote only one day of the week to their affairs in\r\ntown, reserving the remaining seven for country life.[105]\r\n\r\nSo long as they persisted in this practice they accomplished two\r\nthings both that their farms were fertile through good cultivation and\r\nthat they themselves enjoyed the best of health: they felt no need of\r\nthose Greek gymnasia which now every one of us must have in his town\r\nhouse, nor did they deem that in order to enjoy a house in the country\r\none must give sounding Greek names to all its apartments, such as\r\n[Greek: prokoiton] (antechamber) [Greek: palaistra] (exercising room)\r\n[Greek: apodutaerion] (dressing room) [Greek: peristulon] (arcade)\r\n[Greek: ornithon] or (poultry house) [Greek: peristereon] (dove cote)\r\n[Greek: oporothaekae] (fruitery) and the like.\r\n\r\nSince now forsooth most of our gentry crowd into town, abandoning\r\nthe sickle and the plough and prefer to exercise their hands in the\r\ntheatre and the circus rather than in the corn field and the vineyard,\r\nit has resulted that we must fain buy the very corn that fills our\r\nbellies and have it hauled in for us, yea, out of Africa and Sardinia,\r\nwhile we bring home the vintage in ships from the islands of Cos and\r\nChios!\r\n\r\nAnd so it has happened that those lands which the shepherds who\r\nfounded the city taught their children to cultivate are now, by their\r\nlater descendants, converted again from corn fields back to pastures,\r\nthus in their greed of gain violating even the law, since they fail to\r\ndistinguish the difference between agriculture and grazing.[106] For a\r\nshepherd is one thing and a ploughman another, nor for all that he may\r\nfeed his stock on farm land is a drover the same as a teamster: herded\r\ncattle, indeed, do nothing to create what grows in the land, but\r\ndestroy it with their teeth, while the yoked ox on the contrary\r\nconduces to the maturity of grain in the corn fields and forage in the\r\nfallow land. The practice and the art of the farmer is one thing, I\r\nsay; that of the shepherd another; the farmer's object being that what\r\never may be produced by cultivating the land should yield a profit;\r\nthat of the shepherd to make his profit from the increase of his\r\nflock; and yet the relation between them is intimate because it is\r\nmuch more desirable for a farmer to feed his forage on the land than\r\nto sell it, and a herd of cattle is the best source of supply of that\r\nwhich is the most available food of growing plants, namely, manure:[107]\r\nso it follows that whoever has a farm ought to practise both arts,\r\nthat of agriculture and that of grazing cattle, indeed, also that of\r\nfeeding game, as is done at our country houses, since no little profit\r\nmay be derived from aviaries and rabbit warrens and fish ponds.\r\nAnd since I have written a book concerning the first of these\r\noccupations--that of the husbandry of agriculture--for my wife\r\nFundania because of her interest in that subject, now, my dear\r\nTurranius Niger, I write this one on the husbandry of live stock for\r\nyou, who are so keen a stock fancier that you are a frequent attendant\r\nat the cattle market at Macri Campi, where, by your fortunate\r\nspeculations, you have found means to make provision for many crying\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nI could do this on my own authority because I am myself a considerable\r\nowner of live stock with my flocks of sheep in Apulia and my stud\r\nof horses at Reate, but I will run through the subject, briefly and\r\nsummarily rehearsing what I gathered from conversation with certain\r\nlarge stock feeders in Epirus at the time when, being in command of\r\nthe fleet in Greece during the war with the pirates, I lay between\r\nDelos and Sicily.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the origin, the importance and the economy of live stock\r\nhusbandry_\r\n\r\nI.[109] When Menates had gone, Cossinius said to me: \"We shall not let\r\nyou go until you have explained those three points which you began to\r\ndiscuss the other day when we were interrupted.\"\r\n\r\n\"What three points,\" said Murrius. \"Are they those concerning feeding\r\ncattle, of which you spoke to me yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Cossinius, \"they are the considerations of what was the\r\norigin, what the importance, and what the economy of the husbandry of\r\nlive stock. Varro here had begun to discourse upon them while we were\r\ncalling on Petus during his illness, when the arrival of the physician\r\ninterrupted us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the three divisions of the [Greek: historikon] or interpretation\r\nof this subject, which you have mentioned, I will venture,\" said I,\r\n\"to speak only of the first two, of the origin and of the importance\r\nof this industry. The third division, of how it should be practised,\r\nScrofa shall undertake for us, as one, if I may speak Greek to a\r\ncompany of half Greek shepherds [Greek: hos per mou pollon ameinon]\r\n(who is better qualified than I am),[110] for Scrofa was the teacher of\r\nC. Lucilius Hirrus, your son-in-law, whose flocks and herds in Bruttii\r\nhave such reputation.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" interrupted Scrofa, \"you shall hear what we have to say only on\r\ncondition that you, who come from Epirus and are masters of the art of\r\nfeeding cattle, shall recompense us and shall give public testimony of\r\nwhat you know on the subject: for none of us knows it all.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus assumed that my share of the discussion should be the\r\nfirst or theoretical part of the subject (which I did, although I have\r\na stock farm in Italy, because, as the proverb is, not every one who\r\nowns a lyre is a musician), I began:\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless in the very order of nature both man and cattle have\r\nexisted since the beginning of time, for whether we believe that there\r\nwas a First Cause of the generation of animals, as Thales of Miletus\r\nand Zeno of Citium maintained, or that there was none as was the\r\nopinion of Pythagoras of Samos and Aristotle of Stagira, it is, as\r\nDicaearchus points out, a necessity of human life to have descended\r\ngradually from the earliest time to the present day: thus in the\r\nbeginning was the primitive age when man lived on whatever the virgin\r\nsoil produced spontaneously; thence he descended to the second or\r\npastoral age, when, as he had formerly gathered for his use acorns,[111]\r\nstrawberries, mulberries and apples by picking them from trees and\r\nbushes, so now, to satisfy a like need, he captured in the woods such\r\nas he could of the wild beasts of the field, and, having enclosed,\r\nbegan to domesticate them. Among these it is considered not without\r\nreason that sheep were foremost, both because of their utility and\r\nbecause of their docile nature, for this animal is the gentlest of all\r\nand most readily accommodated to the life of man, and supplies him\r\nwith milk and cheese for food, and skins and wool to clothe his body.\r\n\r\n\"Finally, by the third step, man descended from the pastoral age to\r\nthat of agriculture. In this there have persisted many relics of the\r\ntwo preceding ages, which, long remaining in their original state, are\r\nfound even in our day: for in many places may yet be seen some kinds\r\nof our domestic cattle still in their wild state, such as the large\r\nflocks of wild sheep in Phrygia, and in Samothrace a species of wild\r\ngoats like those which are called \"big horns\" (platycerotes) and\r\nabound in Italy on the mountains of Fiscellum and Tetrica. Every body\r\nknows that there are wild swine, unless you maintain that the wild\r\nboar is not a true member of the swine family.\r\n\r\n\"There are still many cattle running at large in Dardania, Medica and\r\nThrace, while there are wild asses in Phrygia and Lycaonia, and wild\r\nhorses in certain regions of hither Spain.\r\n\r\n\"I have now told you of the origin of the industry of feeding cattle.\r\nAs to its importance, I have this to say:\r\n\r\n\"The most important persons of antiquity were all keepers of live\r\nstock, as both the Greek and Latin languages reveal, as well as the\r\nearliest poets, who describe their heroes some as [Greek: polyarnos]\r\n(rich in lambs), some as [Greek: polymaelos] (rich in sheep), and\r\nothers as [Greek: polyboutaes] (rich in herds), and tell of flocks\r\nwhich on account of their value were said to have golden fleeces, like\r\nthat of Atreus in Argos which he complained that Thyestes stole away\r\nfrom him: or that ram which Aeetes sacrificed at Colchis, whose fleece\r\nwas the quest of those princes known as the Argonauts: or again like\r\nthose so called golden apples (_mala_) of the Hesperides that Hercules\r\nbrought back from Africa into Greece, which were, according to the\r\nancient tradition, in fact goats and sheep which the Greeks, from the\r\nsound of their voice, called [Greek: maela]: indeed, much in the same\r\nway our country people, using a different letter (since the bleat of a\r\nsheep seems to make more of the sound of _bee_ than of _me_) say that\r\nsheep \"be-alare,\" whence by the elision of a letter as often happens,\r\nis derived the word _belare_ (or _balare_), to bleat.\r\n\r\n\"If cattle had not been held in the highest esteem among the ancients\r\nthe astrologers would not have called the signs of the zodiac by their\r\nnames in describing the heavens: and they not only did not hesitate to\r\nplace them there but many even begin their enumeration of the twelve\r\nsigns with these animal names, thus giving Aries and Taurus precedence\r\nover Apollo and Hercules, whose signs, very gods as they are, are\r\nsubordinated under the name of Gemini: nor did they deem that a sixth\r\nof these twelve signs was a sufficient proportion for the names of\r\ncattle, but they must even add Capricornus and make it a quarter.\r\nFurthermore, in naming the constellations they selected other names of\r\ncattle, as the goat, the kid, and the dog. And in like manner have not\r\ncertain parts both of the sea and of the land taken their names from\r\ncattle, as witness the Aegean Sea, which is called after the Greek\r\nname for goat [Greek: aigeos], and Mount Taurus in Syria after the\r\nbull, and Mount Cantherius in the Sabine country after the horse, and\r\nthe Thracian, as well as the Cimmerian, Bosphorus, after the ox:\r\nand again many place names on land like the town in Greece known as\r\n[Greek: hippion Argos], or horse breeding Argos. Yea, Italy itself\r\nderives its name, according to Piso, from _vitula_, our word for\r\nheifer.\r\n\r\n\"Who can deny that the Roman people themselves are sprung from a race\r\nof shepherds, for every one knows that Faustulus, the foster father\r\nof Romulus and Remus, who brought them up, was a shepherd. Is it not\r\nproof that they were shepherds that they chose the Parilia, or feast\r\nof the goddess of the shepherds, in preference to all other days, for\r\nthe founding of the city; that a penalty even to this day is assessed\r\nin terms of cattle or sheep, according to the ancient custom; that our\r\nmost ancient money, the _as_ of cast copper, always bore the effigy of\r\nsome domestic animal; that whenever a town was founded the limits of\r\nthe walls and the gates were laid off with a plough drawn by a bull\r\nand a cow yoked together; that when the Roman people are purified it\r\nis done by driving around them a boar, a ram and a bull, whence the\r\nsacrifice is known as the Suovetaurilia; that we have many family\r\nnames among us derived from both the great and small cattle: thus\r\nfrom small cattle Porcius, Ovinius, Caprilius, and from great cattle\r\nEquitius, Taurius, and some of our families have received from cattle\r\ncognomens which signify for what they are esteemed, as, for instance,\r\nthe Annius family are called Capra, the Statilius family are called\r\nTaurus and the Pomponius family are called Vitulus, and so many others\r\nare derived from cattle.\r\n\r\n\"It remains now to discuss the art of animal husbandry, and on this\r\nsubject our friend Scrofa, to whom this age has awarded the palm for\r\nexcellence in all branches of farm management, will say what ever is\r\nto be said, as he is better qualified than am I.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all eyes had been turned upon him, Scrofa began:\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless the art of breeding and of feeding cattle consists in\r\ngetting the maximum profit out of those things from which the very\r\nname of money is derived, for our word for money (_pecunia_) comes\r\nfrom _pecus_, cattle, which is the foundation of all wealth.\r\n\r\n\"Our enquiry may be divided into nine subjects, or three parts each\r\nwith three subdivisions, namely: (i) concerning small cattle, of which\r\nthe three kinds are sheep, goats and swine: (2) concerning large\r\ncattle, which are likewise divided by nature into three species, neat\r\ncattle, asses and horses: and (3) concerning those instruments of\r\nanimal husbandry which are not kept for profit but for convenience,\r\nnamely: mules, dogs and shepherds. Each of these nine subjects must be\r\nconsidered under nine heads: (a) four relating to the acquisition of\r\ncattle, (b) four to the care of them, and (c) one which has to do\r\nwith all the others. So there are at least eighty-one chapters\r\nfor discussion of the subject, all indispensable and all of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\"Under the head (a) of acquisition, it is first of all necessary, to\r\nenable you to buy good live stock, that you should know at what age it\r\nis best to buy and to keep each different kind. For instance, you may\r\nbuy neat cattle for less money before they are a year old and after\r\nthey are ten, because they begin to breed at two or three years and\r\nleave off soon after the tenth year, the beginning and the end of the\r\nlife of all live stock being sterile. The second consideration under\r\nthis head is a knowledge of the conformation of each kind of cattle\r\nand what it should be, for this is of great importance in determining\r\nthe value of all animals. Thus experienced stockmen buy cattle with\r\nblack horns rather than white, large goats rather than small, and\r\nswine with long bodies and short heads. The third consideration under\r\nthis head is to make sure of the breeding. On this account the asses\r\nof Arcadia are celebrated in Greece, as are those of Reate in Italy,\r\nso that I remember an ass that brought sixty thousand sesterces, and a\r\nfour-in-hand team at Rome that was held at four hundred thousand. The\r\nfourth consideration is of the legal precautions to be observed in\r\nbuying live stock, for in order that title may pass from one to\r\nanother certain formalities must intervene, since neither a contract\r\nnor even the payment of the purchase money suffices in all cases to\r\ntransfer a title: thus in buying you some times stipulate that the\r\nanimal is in good health, some times that it comes out of a healthy\r\nflock or herd, and some times no stipulation at all is made.\r\n\r\n\"Under the head (b) of the care of live stock, the four considerations\r\nare what should be done, after you have bought your cattle, in respect\r\nof feeding, of breeding, of raising them, and of maintaining their\r\nhealth. In the matter of feeding, which is the first of these\r\nconsiderations, the three things to be observed are where and how\r\nmuch, when, and on what your cattle will graze: thus it suits goats\r\nbetter to graze on rough and mountain land than in fat pastures,\r\nwhile the contrary is true of horses. Nor are the same places fit for\r\ngrazing for all kinds of cattle both in summer and winter: thus flocks\r\nof sheep are driven from Apulia a long distance into Samnium to spend\r\nthe summer, and are reported to the tax farmer to be registered lest\r\nthey violate the regulations of the censor.[112]\r\n\r\n\"In the same way mules are driven in the summer from the prairie of\r\nRosea to the high mountains of Gurgures.\r\n\r\n\"The rules for feeding each kind of live stock in the barn yard must\r\nalso be studied, as, for instance, that hay is fed to the horse and\r\nthe ox, while it will not do for swine which require mast, and that\r\nbarley and beans should at intervals be fed to some kinds of stock,\r\nlupines to draft cattle and alfalfa and clover to milch cows.\r\nFurthermore, it is desirable to feed the ram and the bull more heavily\r\nfor thirty days before admitting them to the flock and the herd, the\r\npurpose being to increase their strength, while on the other hand the\r\nfeed of the cows is cut down at that time because it is deemed that\r\nthey breed most successfully when they are thin.\r\n\r\n\"The next consideration is concerning breeding, which I call the period\r\nbetween conception and birth, for these are the beginning and the end\r\nof pregnancy. First of all then we should consider the stinting and\r\nthe season at which this should be accomplished, for as the\r\nseason from the rising of the west wind to the vernal equinox\r\n(February-March) is considered best for swine, so that from the\r\nsetting of Arcturus to the setting of Aquila (May-July) is best for\r\nsheep. Furthermore, a rule should be made that the male animals are\r\nkept apart from the females for some time before they are bred, a\r\nperiod which neatherds and shepherds usually fix at two months. The\r\nnext consideration is of the rules to be observed while the animal\r\nis pregnant, because the periods of gestation differ in the several\r\ndomestic animals: thus the mare goes twelve months, the cow ten, the\r\newe and the goat five and the sow four.\r\n\r\n\"In Spain is reported a phenomenon of breeding which seems incredible,\r\nbut is nevertheless true, namely: that on Mount Tagnus on that part of\r\nthe coast of Lusitania near the town of Olisippo, mares are some\r\ntimes impregnated by the wind,[113] some thing which often happens with\r\nrespect to chickens, whence their eggs are called [Greek: hypaenemios]\r\n(conceived by the wind),[114] but the foals born of such mares never\r\nlive more than three years.\r\n\r\n\"When lambs are born in due season, or what we call _chordi_ (that is\r\nto say those lambs which are born late and have remained beyond their\r\nseason in the belly of the dam, the name _chordi_, being derived from\r\n[Greek: chorion] the Greek name for the membrane which is called the\r\nafter birth), care must be taken to clean them and set them gently on\r\ntheir feet and to prevent the dam from crushing them.\r\n\r\n\"On the third consideration with respect to raising young animals, you\r\nmust consider for how long they should be permitted to suck the dam\r\nand when and where, and if the mother has an insufficient supply of\r\nmilk, how you may put the young one to nurse at the udder of another:\r\nin which case they are called _subrumi_, that is to say, under the\r\nudder, for I think that rumis is an old word for udder.\r\n\r\n\"Lambs are weaned usually at the end of four months, kids in three,\r\npigs in two. Weanling pigs, from the fact that they are considered fit\r\nto be offered for sacrifice at that age, were formerly called _sacres_\r\nas Plautus calls them when he says, \"What's the price of sacred\r\npigs?\"[115] In like manner stall fed cattle, which are being fattened\r\nfor the public sacrifices, are called _opimi_.\r\n\r\n\"The fourth consideration relates to the health of the cattle, a\r\nsubject as important as it is complex, for a single beast which may be\r\nsick or infected and ailing often brings a great calamity on an entire\r\nherd. There are two degrees of the healing art, one which requires\r\nconsultation with a surgeon, as for men: the other which the skilful\r\nshepherd can himself practise, and this consists of three parts,\r\nnamely: the consideration of what are the causes, the symptoms and the\r\ntreatment which should be followed in relation to each malady. The\r\ncommon causes of disease in cattle are excess of heat or of cold,\r\noverwork, or its opposite lack of exercise, or, if when they have been\r\nworked, you give them food and drink at once without an interval of\r\nrest. The symptoms of fever due to heat or overwork are a gaping\r\nmouth, heavy humid breath and a burning body. The cure when such is\r\nthe malady is this: bathe the animal with water, rub it with a warm\r\nmixture of oil and wine, put it on a nourishing diet, blanket it\r\nas protection against chills and give it tepid water when it is\r\nthirsty.[116] If this treatment does not suffice, let the blood, chiefly\r\nfrom the head.\r\n\r\n\"So there are different causes and different symptoms of the maladies\r\npeculiar to each kind of cattle, and the flock master should have them\r\nall written down.\r\n\r\n\"It remains to speak of the ninth head (c), which I mentioned, and this\r\nrelates to the number of cattle to be kept and so concerns both of the\r\nother heads.\r\n\r\n\"For whoever buys cattle must consider the number of herds and how many\r\nin each herd he can feed on his land, lest his pastures prove short or\r\nmore than he need, as so in either case the profit be lost. Further\r\nmore, one should know how many breeding ewes there are in the flock,\r\nhow many rams, how many lambs of each sex, how many culls to be weeded\r\nout. Thus, if a ewe has more lambs at a birth than she can nourish,\r\nyou should do what some shepherds practise--take part of them away\r\nfrom her, which is done to the end that those remaining may prosper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beware!\" put in Atticus, \"that your generalisations do not lead\r\nyou astray, and that your insistence on the rule of nine does not\r\ncontradict your own definition of small and large cattle: for how can\r\nall your principles be applied to mules and to shepherds, since those\r\nwith respect to breeding certainly cannot be followed so far as they\r\nare concerned. As to dogs I can see their application. I admit even\r\nthat men may be included in them, because they have their wives on\r\nthe farm in winter, and indeed even in their summer pasture camps,\r\na concession which is deemed beneficial because it attaches the\r\nshepherds to their flocks, and by begetting children they increase the\r\nestablishment and with it the profit on your investment.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Scrofa's number cannot be measured with a carpenter's rule,\" said\r\nI, \"neither can many other generalisations, as, for instance, when we\r\nsay that a thousand ships sailed against Troy, or that a certain court\r\nof Rome consists of a hundred judges (_centumviri_). Leave out, if you\r\nwish, the two chapters relating to breeding in so far as mules are\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should we,\" exclaimed Vaccius, \"for it is related that on\r\nseveral occasions at Rome a mule has had a foal.\"\r\n\r\nTo back up what Vaccius had said, I cited Mago and Dionysius as\r\nwriting that when mules and mares conceive they bear in the twelfth\r\nmonth. \"If,\" I added, \"it is considered a prodigy in Italy when a mule\r\nhas a foal, it is not necessarily so in all countries. For is it not\r\ntrue that swallows and swans breed in Italy, which do not lay in other\r\nlands, and don't you know that the Syrian date palm, which bears fruit\r\nin Judea, does not yield in Italy?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you prefer,\" said Scrofa, \"to make out the entire eighty-one\r\nchapters without any on the care of mules during the breeding season,\r\nthere are subjects with which you can fill this double vacancy by\r\nadding those two kinds of extraordinary profit which is derived from\r\nlive stock. One of these is the fleece which men shear or pull from\r\nsheep and goats, the other, which is more widely practised, that\r\nfrom milk and cheese: the Greek writers indeed actually treat this\r\nseparately under the title [Greek: turopoiia], and have written\r\nextensively about it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of sheep_\r\n\r\nII. \"And now, since I have completed my task and the economy of live\r\nstock husbandry has been defined, do you, men of Epirus, requite us\r\nby expounding the subject in detail, so that we may see of what the\r\nshepherds of Pergamis and Maledos are capable.\"\r\n\r\nAt this challenge, Atticus (who then was known as T. Pomponius but now\r\nas Q. Caecilius retaining the same cognomen)[117] began as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I gather that I must make the beginning since you seem to turn your\r\neyes upon me: so I will speak of those cattle which you, Varro, have\r\ncalled primitive, for you say that sheep were the first of the wild\r\nbeasts of the field which were captured and domesticated by man.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place you should buy good sheep, and they are so judged\r\nprimarily in respect of their age, that they are not what is known\r\nas aged nor yet undeveloped lambs, because neither can yield you any\r\nprofit, the one no longer, the other not yet: but you may deem that\r\nage which holds out a promise preferable to that whose only future is\r\ndeath. So far as concerns conformation, a sheep should have a round\r\nbarrel, wool thick and soft and with long fibre, and, while heavy all\r\nover the body, it should be thickest on the back and neck, and yet the\r\nbelly also should be covered, for unless the belly was covered our\r\nancestors were wont to call a sheep _apica_ and throw it out. They\r\nshould have short legs,[118] and, if they are of the Italian breed, long\r\ntails, or short tails if they come from Syria. The most important\r\npoint to guard is that your flock is headed by a good sire. The\r\nquality of a ram can usually be determined from his conformation and\r\nfrom his get. So far as concerns conformation, a ram should have a\r\nface well covered with wool, horns twisted and converging on the\r\nmuzzle, tawny eyes, woolly ears, a deep chest, wide shoulders and\r\nloin, a long and large tail. You should see also whether he has a\r\nblack or a spotted tongue,[119] for such rams usually get black or\r\nspotted lambs. You may judge them by their get, if their lambs are of\r\ngood quality. In buying sheep we practise the formalities which the\r\nlaw requires, following them more or less strictly in particular\r\ncases. Some men in fixing a price per head stipulate that two late\r\nlambs or two toothless ewes shall be counted as one. In other respects\r\nthe traditional formula is employed thus: the buyer says to the\r\nseller, \"Do you sell me these sheep for so much?\" And the seller\r\nanswers, \"They are your sheep,\" and states the price. Whereupon the\r\nbuyer stipulates according to the ancient formula: \"Do you guarantee\r\nthat these sheep, for which we have bargained, are in such good health\r\nas sheep should be; that there is none among them one-eyed, deaf or\r\nbare-bellied; that they do not come out of an infected flock and that\r\nI will take them by good right and title?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even when this is done the title to the flock does not pass until\r\nthey have been counted, but, nevertheless, the purchaser can hold the\r\nseller to the bargain if he does not make delivery, even though the\r\npurchase money has not passed, and by a like right the seller can hold\r\nthe buyer if he does not pay up.\r\n\r\n\"I will next speak about those other four subjects which Scrofa\r\noutlined, namely: the feeding, breeding, raising and physicking of\r\nsheep. In the first place, one should see that provision is made for\r\nfeeding the flock throughout the entire year, as well indoors as out.\r\nThe stable should be in a suitable location, protected against the\r\nwind, looking rather to the East than the South, on cleared and\r\nsloping ground so that it can be easily swept out and kept clean, for\r\nmoisture not only rots the wool of the sheep but their hoofs as well\r\nand causes scab. When sheep have stood for several days you should\r\nstrew the stable with new bedding, so that they may be more\r\ncomfortable and be kept cleaner, and thus eat with more appetite. You\r\nshould also contrive stalls separated from the others in which you may\r\nsegregate the ewes about to yean, as well as any which may be ailing.\r\nThis precaution is practicable, however, only with sheep fed at the\r\nsteading, but those who graze their sheep in the mountain pastures and\r\nfar from cover, carry with them wicker hurdles or nets, and other such\r\nconveniences with which they contrive folds for such separation. Sheep\r\nindeed are grazed far and wide so that often it happens that their\r\nwinter quarters are many miles from their summer pastures.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that to be true,\" said I, \"for my flocks winter in Apulia and\r\nspend the summer in the mountains above Reate: thus the public cattle\r\ndrifts between these two localities balance the separated pastures, as\r\na yoke balances two baskets.\"[120]\r\n\r\nAtticus resumed: \"When sheep are fed continually in the same locality\r\ndistinction must be made in the times of feeding them according to the\r\nseasons: thus in summer they are driven out[121] to pasture at day break\r\nbecause then the dewy grass is more appetizing than at midday, when\r\nit is dry. At sunrise they are driven to water, to make them more\r\nlickerish on their return. About noon and during the heat of the\r\nday they are permitted to lie in the shade of rocks or under broad\r\nspreading trees until the fresher evening air invites them to feed\r\nagain until sunset.[122] A sheep should always graze with the sun behind\r\nit, because its head is very sensitive to heat. At sunset the flock\r\nshould be given a short rest and then driven again to water, and so\r\nbrought back to feed again until it is dark, for at that time of day\r\nthe grass has renewed its pleasant savour. This routine is usually\r\nfollowed from the rising of the Pleiades until the autumn equinox.\r\n\r\n\"After the harvest it is of two-fold advantage to turn the flock in on\r\nthe stubble, as they will fatten on the shattered grain and improve\r\nthe land for next year's planting by spreading their manure in the\r\ntrampled straw.\r\n\r\n\"The rules for pasturing sheep in winter and spring differ from the\r\nsummer rules in this, that at those seasons the flock is not driven\r\nto pasture until the hoar frost has evaporated and they feed all day\r\nlong, one watering about noon being enough.\r\n\r\n\"This is about all there to say on the subject of feeding sheep, so I\r\npass to the consideration of breeding. The rams which you are about\r\nto use for breeding should be separated from the flock for two months\r\nbefore the season, and fed heavily by giving them a ration of barley\r\nwhen they come into the stable from the pasture: it will make them\r\nstronger for their duty.\r\n\r\n\"The best breeding season is from the setting of Arcturus to the\r\nsetting of Aquila, (May-July) because lambs begotten later are apt\r\nto be born runts, and weak. As a ewe is pregnant for one hundred and\r\nfifty days, this arrangement causes her to drop her lambs at the end\r\nof autumn when the temperature is mild and the grass is renewed by the\r\nfirst rains. During the breeding season the flock should drink only\r\nthe same kind of water, since a change not only makes spotted wool but\r\ninjures the offspring. When all the ewes have been stinted, the rams\r\nshould be separated from them again, because it injures ewes to be\r\nteased while they are pregnant. Ewe lambs should never be bred before\r\nthey are two years old, as they cannot earlier produce strong lambs,\r\nbut will themselves degenerate: indeed, it is better to keep them\r\nuntil the third year. To this end some shepherds protect their ewe\r\nlambs from the ram by tying baskets made of rushes or something of\r\nthat kind over their rumps, but it is better to feed them apart from\r\nthe flock.\r\n\r\n\"I come now to the consideration of how lambs should be raised.\r\n\r\n\"When the ewes begin to yean they are driven into a stable which has\r\nstalls set apart for the purpose, where the new born lambs can be\r\nplaced near a fire to strengthen them, and there the ewes are kept two\r\nor there days until the lambs know their dams and are able to feed\r\nthemselves. Thereafter the lambs are still kept up but the ewes are\r\ndriven out to pasture with the flock, being brought back to them in\r\nthe evening to be suckled and then once more separated, lest the lambs\r\nbe trampled by the ewes at night. In the morning before the ewes go\r\nout to pasture they are given access to their young again until the\r\nlambs are satisfied with milk. After about ten days have elapsed the\r\nlambs are picketed out of doors, being tethered with fibre or such\r\nother light material, to stakes planted some distance apart so that\r\nthe little fellows may not injure themselves as they frisk together\r\nall day.\r\n\r\n\"If a lamb will not suck, it should be held up to the teat and its lips\r\ngreased with butter or suet, and so made to smell at the milk. A few\r\ndays later some soft vetch or tender grass may be given them before\r\nthey go out to pasture and after they come in. And so they are nursed\r\nuntil they are four months old.\r\n\r\n\"There are some shepherds who do not milk the ewes during the nursing\r\nperiod, but those who do not milk them at all do better, as thus they\r\nbear more wool and more lambs.\r\n\r\n\"When the lambs are weaned great attention is necessary to prevent them\r\nfrom wasting away in their longing for the dam: they should be tempted\r\nto eat by giving them appetizing food, and care should be taken that\r\nthey do not suffer from cold or heat. When at last they have forgotten\r\nthe taste of milk and no longer yearn for the dam, they may be driven\r\nout with the flock.\r\n\r\n\"A ram lamb should not be altered until he is five months old, nor yet\r\nin very hot or very cold weather. Those which you wish to keep for\r\nrams should be chosen as far as possible from dams who are in the\r\nhabit of having twin lambs.\r\n\r\n\"Most of these recommendations apply equally to those fine wool sheep\r\nwhich are called _pellitae_, because they are jacketed with skins, as\r\nis done at Tarentum and in Attica, to protect their wool from fouling,\r\nfor by this precaution the fleece is kept in better plight for dyeing,\r\nwashing or cleaning. Greater diligence is required to keep clean the\r\nfolds and stables of such sheep than is necessary for the ordinary\r\nbreeds: so they are paved with stone to the end that no urine may\r\nstand anywhere in the stable.\r\n\r\n\"Sheep eat whatever is put before them--fig leaves, marc, even straw.\r\nBran should be fed to them in moderation, lest they eat either too\r\nmuch or too little of it, in either of which cases it is bad for the\r\ndigestion, but clover and alfalfa agree with them best and make both\r\nfat and milk with the utmost facility.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns the health of the flock, there are many things\r\nI might add, but, as Scrofa has said, the flock master keeps his\r\nprescriptions written down in a book and carries with him what he\r\nneeds in the way of physic.\r\n\r\n\"It remains to speak of the number of sheep in a flock. Some make this\r\nmore, some less, for there is no natural limit. In Epirus almost all\r\nof us have a rule not to allow more than one hundred short wool sheep\r\nor fifty fine wool jacketed sheep to a shepherd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of goats_\r\n\r\nIII. As Atticus stopped, Cossinius took him up. \"Come, my dear\r\nFaustulus,\" he cried, \"you have bleated long enough. Take now from me,\r\nas from a late born Homeric Melanthius,[123] a small offering from my\r\nflock of goats, and at the same time learn a lesson in brevity. He\r\nwho wishes to form a flock of goats should consider in choosing them:\r\nfirst of all that they are of an age capable of breeding, and that for\r\nsome time to come, for a tiro is more useful for that purpose than a\r\nveteran. As to conformation, see to it that they are strong and large,\r\nwith a smooth body and thick coat: but beware of the short haired\r\ngoat, for there are both kinds. The she goat should have two\r\nexcrescences, like little teats, hanging under the muzzle: those which\r\nhave them are fecund:[124] the larger the udder the more milk and butter\r\nfat she will yield. The qualities of a buck are that his coat should\r\nbe largely white: his crest and neck short and his gullet long. You\r\nwill have a better flock if you buy at one time goats which have been\r\naccustomed to run together, rather than by putting together a lot of\r\ngoats picked up here and there.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning breeding, I refer to what Atticus has said about sheep,\r\nwith this difference: that while you select a breed of sheep which are\r\nslow of foot, because they are of quieter disposition, all goats are\r\nas excitable as they are agile. Of, this last characteristic Cato\r\nrecords in his book _Origines_: 'In the mountains of Socrate and\r\nFiscellus there are wild goats which leap from rock to rock a distance\r\nof more than sixty feet.' For as the sheep which we feed are sprung\r\nfrom wild sheep, so the goats which we herd are sprung from wild\r\ngoats: and it is from them that the island of Caprasia, near the coast\r\nof Italy, gets its name.\r\n\r\n\"As it is recognized that the best breed of goats is one which bears\r\ntwo kids at a birth, breeding bucks are chosen from such a race\r\nwhenever possible. Some fanciers even take the trouble to import bucks\r\nfrom the island of Melia, where are bred what are considered the\r\nlargest and most beautiful specimens of the race.\r\n\r\n\"I hold that the formula for buying sheep cannot altogether apply to\r\ngoats because no sane man ever guaranteed that goats are without\r\nmalady, for the fact is that they are forever in a fever. For this\r\nreason the usual stipulation has had a few words cut out of it for use\r\nin respect of goats, and, as Manilius gives it in his treatise on the\r\nlaw of Sales, runs as follows: 'Do you guarantee that these goats are\r\nwell today; that they are able to drink, and that I will get good\r\ntitle to them?'\r\n\r\n\"There is a wonderful fact concerning goats which has been stated\r\nby certain ingenious shepherds and is even recorded in the book of\r\nArchelaus, namely, that they do not breathe through their nostrils,\r\nlike other animals, but through their ears.[125]\r\n\r\n\"Upon Scrofa's four considerations which relate to the care of goats\r\nI have this to say. The flock is better stabled in the winter if its\r\nquarters look toward the Southeast, because goats are very sensitive\r\nto cold. So also, as for most cattle, the goat stable should be paved\r\nwith stone or brick that the flock may be less exposed to damp and\r\nmud. When the flock passes the night out of doors, a place should be\r\nselected having the same exposure and the fold strewn with leaves to\r\nprotect the flock from fouling themselves.\r\n\r\n\"There is not much difference in the method of handling goats in the\r\npasture from sheep, but goats have this characteristic, that they\r\nprefer the mountain woodland pastures to meadows, for they feed\r\neagerly on the brushwood and in cultivated places crop the shrubbery;\r\nindeed, their name _caprae_ is derived from _carpere_, to crop. For\r\nthis reason it is customary to stipulate in farm leases that the\r\ntenant shall not graze any goat on the leased land, for their teeth\r\nare the enemies of all planted crops: wherefore the astrologers were\r\ncareful to station them in the heavens outside of the pale of the\r\ntwelve signs of the zodiac, but there are two kids and a goat not far\r\nfrom Taurus.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns breeding, it is the custom to separate the bucks\r\nfrom the pastured flock at the end of autumn and confine them apart,\r\nas has been said with respect to rams. The nannies which conceive at\r\nthis time drop their kids in four months, and so in the spring. In\r\nwhat regards rearing the kids, it is enough to say that when they are\r\nthree months old they are raised and may join the flock. What shall I\r\nsay of the health of these animals who never have any? yet the flock\r\nmaster should have written down what remedies are used for certain of\r\ntheir maladies and especially for the wounds which often befall them\r\nby reason of their constant fighting among themselves and their\r\nfeeding in thorny places. It remains to speak of number: this is\r\nless to the herd in the case of goats than with sheep because of the\r\nwantonness and wandering habit of the goat: sheep, on the other hand,\r\nare wont to flock together and keep in one place.\r\n\r\n\"For another reason it is the custom in Gaul to divide the goats into\r\nmany flocks rather than concentrate them in large ones, because a\r\npestilence quickly takes possession of a large herd and sweeps it to\r\ndestruction. About fifty goats is considered to be a large enough\r\nflock.\r\n\r\n\"The experience of Gaberius, a Roman of the equestrian order, will\r\nillustrate the reason for this: for he, who had a thousand jugera of\r\nland near Rome, met one day a certain goatherd leading ten goats to\r\ntown, and heard him say that he made a denier[126] a day out of each\r\ngoat, whereupon Gaberius bought a thousand goats, hoping that he might\r\nthereby derive from his property an income of a thousand deniers a\r\nday: but so it fell out that he lost all his goats after a brief\r\nillness. On the other hand, among the Sallentini and near Casinum they\r\ngraze their goats in flocks of one hundred.\r\n\r\n\"Almost the same difference of opinion exists as to the relative number\r\nof bucks to nannies, for some, and I am among them, allow a buck to\r\nevery ten nannies, but others, like Menas, make it fifteen, and some\r\neven twenty, like Murrius.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of swine_\r\n\r\nIV. \"And now,\" concluded Cossinius, \"which of you Italian swine\r\nbreeders will stand forth and tell us of his herd? Surely he should be\r\nable to speak with the most authority whose cognomen is Scrofa.\"\r\n\r\nAt this pleasantry, Tremelius turned upon Cossinius and said: \"You seem\r\nto be ignorant why I am called Scrofa, but, in order that our friends\r\nsitting beside you may understand, you should know my family did not\r\nalways bear this swinish cognomen, nor am I of the race of Eumaeus. The\r\nfirst of us to be called Scrofa was my grandfather who, when he was\r\nquaestor under the praetor Licinius Nerva, and was left in command of\r\nthe army in the province of Macedonia during the absence of the praetor,\r\nit so happened that the enemy thought they had an opportunity to gain a\r\nvictory and began to attack the camp. My grandfather, in exhorting the\r\nsoldiers to take up their arms and go out against the enemy, exclaimed\r\nthat he would soon scatter them as a sow (scrofa) does her pigs, and he\r\nwas as good as his word. For in that battle he so overwhelmed and\r\ndiscomfited the enemy, that on account of it the praetor Nerva was\r\nhailed Imperator and my grandfather obtained his cognomen and so was\r\ncalled Scrofa.[127] So, while neither my great grandfather nor any of my\r\nancestors of the Tremelian family was ever called Scrofa, yet as I am\r\nnot less than the sixth of our family in succession who has attained\r\npraetorian rank, it ill becomes me to run away in the face of your\r\nchallenge, so I will tell you what I know about swine. Indeed from my\r\nyouth I have been devoted to agriculture, so that I am perhaps as well\r\nacquainted with that animal as is any of you great stockmen: for who of\r\nus cultivates a farm but keeps hogs, and who has not heard his father\r\nsay that that man is either lazy or a spendthrift who hangs in the meat\r\nhouse a flitch of bacon obtained from the butcher rather than from his\r\nown farm.\r\n\r\n\"He who wishes to have a proper herd of swine ought to choose them, in\r\nthe first place, of the right age, and in the second place, of good\r\nconformation: which means large everywhere except in the head and feet\r\nand of a solid colour rather than spotted: but the boar should have\r\nwithout fail a thick neck in addition to these other qualities. Swine\r\nof good breed may be known from their appearance, if both boar and sow\r\nare of good conformation; from their get, if they have many pigs at\r\na birth; and from their origin, if you buy them in a place with a\r\nreputation for producing fat rather than lean hogs. The usual formula\r\nfor buying runs thus: 'Do you warrant that these hogs are in good\r\nhealth; that I shall take good title to them; that they have committed\r\nno tort, and that they do not come out of a diseased herd?'\r\n\r\n\"Some add a particular stipulation that they are not affected with\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of pasture, a marshy place is well fitted for hogs,\r\nbecause they delight not only in water, but in mud, the reason for\r\nwhich appears in the tradition that when a wolf has fallen upon a hog\r\nhe always drags the carcass into the water because his teeth cannot\r\nendure the natural heat of hog flesh.\r\n\r\n\"Swine are fed mostly on mast, though also on beans, barley and other\r\nkinds of corn, which not only make them fat but give the meat an\r\nagreeable relish. In summer they go out to pasture early in the\r\nmorning and before the heat of the day: at midday they are brought\r\ninto some shady place, preferably where there is water: in the\r\nafternoon, when the heat has abated, they are fed again. In the winter\r\ntime they do not go out to pasture until the hoar frost has evaporated\r\nand the ice has melted.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of breeding, the boar should be separated from the herd\r\nfor two months before the season, which should be arranged between\r\nthe rising of the west wind and the vernal equinox, for thus it will\r\nbefall that the sows (which are big for four months) will have their\r\nlitters in summer when forage is plenty. Sows should not be bred under\r\na year old, but it is better to wait until the twentieth month so that\r\nthey may have pigs at two years. They are said to breed regularly for\r\nseven years after the first litter. During the breeding season they\r\nshould be given access to muddy ditches and sloughs, so that they may\r\nwallow in the mud, which is the same relaxation to them that a bath\r\nis to a man. When all the sows are stinted, the boars should be\r\nsegregated again. A boar is fit for service at eight months and so\r\ncontinues until his prime, after which his vigor decreases until he is\r\nfit only for the butcher to make of his flesh a dainty offering for\r\nthe people. Our name for the hog, _sus_, is called [Greek: hus]\r\nin Greek, but formerly it was [Greek: thus], derived from [Greek:\r\nthuein], meaning to offer as a sacrifice, for it seems that victims\r\nwere chosen from the race of swine for the earliest sacrifices;\r\nevidence of which remains in the tradition that pigs are sacrificed\r\nat the initiation to the mysteries of Ceres, that when a treaty\r\nis ratified peace begins with the slaughter of a pig, and that in\r\nsolemnizing a marriage the ancient kings and mighty men of Etruria\r\ncaused the bride and the bridegroom to sacrifice a pig at the\r\nbeginning of the ceremony, a practice which the earliest Latins and\r\nthe Greek colonists in Italy seem also to have followed: nam et\r\nnostrae mulieres, maxime nutrices, naturam qua feminae sunt\r\nin virginibus appellant porcum, et graecae [Greek: choiron],\r\nsignificantes esse dignum insigni nuptiarum.[128]\r\n\r\n\"The hog is said to be created by nature for the food of man[129] and\r\nso life and salt perform the same functions for him, as they both\r\npreserve his flesh.\r\n\r\n\"The Gauls[130] are reputed to put up not only the largest quantity but\r\nthe best quality of pork: evidence of its quality being that even now\r\nhams, sausage,[131] bacon and shoulders are imported every year from\r\nGaul to Rome: while Cato writes concerning the amount of pork cured by\r\nthe Gauls: 'In (northern) Italy the Insubres are wont to put up three\r\nor four thousand cuts of pork [the bulk of which can be appreciated\r\nfrom the fact that among that people][132] the hog some times grows so\r\nfat that it is not able to stand on its feet or to walk, so that it\r\nis necessary to put it on a cart to move it any where.' Atilius the\r\nSpaniard, who is a truthful man and learned in many things, tells of\r\na hog which was killed in further Spain or Lusitania from which two\r\nchops, sent to the Senator L. Volumnius, were found to weigh three and\r\ntwenty pounds, the fat on them being so thick that it measured a foot\r\nand three fingers from the skin to the bone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can testify to some thing not less extraordinary than what you have\r\nrelated,\" said I, \"for in Arcadia I saw with my own eyes a hog which\r\nwas so fat that not only was it unable to get up but a shrew mouse\r\nhaving eaten a hole in its back had there made its nest and was\r\nrearing a family. I have heard that this same thing happened in the\r\ncountry of the Veneti.\"\r\n\r\n\"Usually,\" resumed Scrofa, \"the fecundity of a sow may be learned from\r\nher first litter, for in later litters she does not vary much from the\r\nnumber of pigs in the first.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of rearing young swine, which we call _porculatio_ it\r\nis customary to leave pigs with the sow for two months, and then when\r\nthey are able to feed themselves to separate them. Pigs born in the\r\nwinter are apt to be runts on account of the cold and because the sow\r\nrefuses to suckle them, partly by reason of her lack of milk at that\r\nseason and partly to protect her teats from the teeth of the hungry\r\npigs.\r\n\r\n\"Each sow should suckle her pigs in her own stye, because a sow will\r\nnot drive strange pigs away from her, and it results that if the\r\nlitters are mingled the breed deteriorates. The year is naturally\r\ndivided for the sow into two parts, because they breed twice a year,\r\nbeing heavy in pig for four months and suckling for two. The stye\r\nshould be built about three feet deep and a little more in width and\r\nsuch a height from the ground as will permit a pregnant sow to get out\r\nwithout straining herself, as that might cause her to abort. A good\r\nmeasure of the proper height from the ground is what is necessary to\r\nenable the swineherd to keep watch that no little pigs are crushed by\r\nthe sow, and to clean out the bedding easily. There should be a door\r\nto the stye with the lower sill elevated a foot and a palm high so as\r\nto prevent the pigs from following the sow when she goes out. As often\r\nas the swineherd cleans out the stye he should strew the floor with\r\nsand, or some thing else to absorb moisture.\r\n\r\n\"When a sow has had her pigs she should be fed liberally to enable her\r\nto make milk: for this the ration is usually two pounds of boiled\r\nbarley, indeed some feed this both at morning and at night if other\r\nfeed is lacking. When pigs are taken from their dam they are sometimes\r\ncalled _delici_ or weanlings being then no longer _lactantes_ or\r\nsucklings.\r\n\r\n\"Pigs are considered to be clean ten days after birth, and for that\r\nreason were then called by the ancients sacred, as being then first\r\nfit for sacrifice: and so in the _Menaechmi_ of Plautus, when a\r\ncharacter thinking some one in Epidamnus to be out of his wits and\r\nseeking to purify him, asks: 'How much are sacred pigs here.'\r\n\r\n\"If the farm affords them, pigs should be fed grape husks and stalks.\r\n\r\n\"After they have lost the name of _lactantes_ the shoats are called\r\n_nefrendes_ because they are not yet able to break down (_frendere_\r\nthat is _frangere_) the bean stalks. _Porcus_ is the ancient Greek\r\nname for them but is fallen into disuse, for the Greeks now call them\r\n[Greek: choiros].\r\n\r\n\"While she is giving suck the sow should be watered twice a day to\r\npromote the flow of milk. A sow should bear as many pigs as she has\r\nteats: if she has less it is considered that she is unprofitable, but\r\nif more, a prodigy. In this respect there is the ancient tradition\r\nthat the sow of Aeneas bore thirty white (_albos_) pigs at\r\nLavinium,[133] which portended that after thirty years the inhabitants\r\nof Lavinium would found the town of Alba: indeed, vestiges of this sow\r\nand of her pigs may still be seen at Lavinium where there is a brazen\r\nimage of them now in the public square, and the true body of the sow\r\nis shown by the priests, preserved in pickle.\r\n\r\n\"Sows are able at first to suckle eight little pigs, but as they grow\r\nlarger half of them are usually taken away by experienced swineherds,\r\nbecause the sow cannot supply milk enough for all, and too many pigs\r\nfed together do not prosper in any event. A sow should not be driven\r\nout of the stye for ten days after having her litter except for\r\nwater, but after that time she is permitted to graze in a paddock so\r\nconveniently near at hand that she may return to the stye frequently\r\nto suckle the pigs. When the pigs are large enough they are permitted\r\nto follow the sow to pasture, but at home they should be penned apart\r\nfrom the sow and fed by themselves until they overcome their yearning\r\nfor the dam, which usually happens in ten days. The swineherd should\r\ntrain his shoats to do every thing at the sound of the trumpet. This\r\ntraining is begun by letting the shoats hear the trumpet outside\r\ntheir pens and then at once come out to a place where barley has been\r\nscattered broad cast (for thus less is wasted than if the feed is\r\nput in heaps and more of the shoats can get to it easily). By such\r\neducation it is possible to collect pasturing hogs at the sound of a\r\ntrumpet and prevent their being lost when scattered in the woods.[134]\r\n\r\n\"Boars are altered most successfully when they are a year old, but in\r\nno case should this be done when they are less than six months old.\r\nAfter the operation they are no longer called boars, but barrows.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning the health of swine, I will say one thing only by way of\r\nexample: if the sow is not able to supply milk the sucking pigs should\r\nbe fed, until they are three months old, on roasted wheat (for when it\r\nis raw it loosens the bowels) or on barley boiled in water.\r\n\r\n\"As to number: it is considered that ten boars to an hundred sows is\r\nenough; some even reduce this proportion.\r\n\r\n\"The practice varies as to the number to a herd, but my judgment is\r\nthat a hundred is a moderate number: some make it more, say 150: some\r\nfeed two herds together, and some do even more than that. A small herd\r\nis less expensive than a large one because the swineherd requires less\r\nassistance. A swinefeeder should fix the number to be fed as a herd on\r\na principle of utility, not by the number of boars he may happen to\r\nhave, for that is determined by nature.\"\r\n\r\nSo far Scrofa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of neat cattle_\r\n\r\nV. At this point we were joined by the Senator Q. Lucienus, a man as\r\nlearned as he is agreeable and intimate with us all. \"Hail, my fellow\r\ncitizens of Epirus,\" he exclaimed in Greek,[135] \"and you, my dear\r\nVarro, 'shepherd of men,' for I have already greeted Scrofa this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nWhile one saluted him, another reproached him for having come so late\r\nto our club.\r\n\r\n\"I will see to that, my merry men, for I am about to offer you my back\r\nand a scourge: or else, Murrius, you who are my friend: come with me\r\nwhile I pay a forfeit to the goddess Pales, so that you may bear me\r\nwitness if our friends here seek to make me do it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him,\" said Atticus, turning to Murrius, \"what we have been\r\ntalking about and what is still on the programme, so that when his\r\nturn comes he may be prepared. In the meantime we will take up the\r\nsecond order of domestic live stock and proceed to a discussion of the\r\nlarger cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this,\" said Vaccius, \"my name would seem to assign me a part,\r\nsince cows (_vaccae_) are included in that category. Wherefore I will\r\ntell what I know about neat cattle, so that he who knows less may\r\nlearn, while he who knows more may correct me when I fall down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be careful what you do, Vaccius,\" said I, \"for the genus _Bos_ is\r\nof the first importance among cattle, certainly in Italy, which is\r\nthought to have taken its very name from that family, for, as Timaeus\r\nrecords, in ancient Greece a bull was called [Greek: italos], whence\r\nis derived our word _vitula_, and from this Italy is supposed to have\r\ntaken its name because of the number and beauty of its breed, of\r\ncattle (_vituli_). Others claim that the name comes from that of\r\nthe famous bull Italus which Hercules drove out of Sicily into this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\"The ox is indeed the companion and fellow labourer of man and the\r\nminister of Ceres: wherefore the ancients, holding him inviolable,\r\nmade it a capital offence to kill an ox.[136] Both Attica and\r\nPeloponnesus bear witness of the regard in which the ox was held: for\r\nhe who first yoked oxen to the plough is celebrated at Athens under\r\nthe name Buzyges and at Argos under that of Homogyros.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" replied Vaccius, \"the importance of the ox and that his\r\nvery name is used to signify that quality, as in words like [Greek:\r\nbousukon](big fig), [Greek: boupais](a big boy), [Greek: boulimos] (a\r\nravenous hunger),[Greek: boopis] (large eyed), and again that a certain\r\nlarge grape is called _bumamma_ (cow teat). Furthermore, I know it was\r\nthe form of a bull that Jupiter assumed when he wooed Europa and bore\r\nher across the sea from Phoenicia: that it was a bull which protected\r\nthe children of Neptune and Melanippe from being crushed in a stable\r\nby a herd of cattle: I know too that the bees which give the sweetest\r\nhoney are generated from the carcase of an ox, whence the Greeks call\r\nthem [Greek: bougeneis] (born of an ox), an expression which Plautius\r\nlatinized on the occasion where the praetor Hirrius, was accused at\r\nRome of having libeled the Senate. 'But be of good cheer, I will\r\ngive you at least as great satisfaction as did he who wrote the\r\nBugonia.'[137]\r\n\r\n\"In the first place there are said to be four ages of cattle,\r\nduring which they are known by the successive designation of calf\r\n(_vitulus_), yearling (_juvencus_), prime (_novellus_) and aged\r\n(_vetulus_). These designations are further divided according to sex,\r\nas bull-calf and heifer-calf, or bull and cow.\r\n\r\n\"A cow which is sterile is called _taura_: when pregnant, _horda_,\r\nfrom which last name a certain festival is called the _hordicalia\r\n(Fordicidia_) because cows in calf are sacrificed upon it.\r\n\r\n\"He who wishes to buy a herd of neat cattle should take care first that\r\nthey are of an age to produce, rather than past breeding; that they\r\nare well set up, clean limbed, square bodied, large, with black horns\r\nand broad brows, large black eyes, hairy ears, flat cheek bones,\r\nsnub-nosed, not hump-backed but rather with the back bone slightly\r\nroached, wide nostrils, blackish lips, a neck muscular and long with\r\ndew laps hanging from it, the barrel large and well ribbed, the\r\nshoulders broad and the quarters good, a tail sweeping the heels,\r\nthe end being frizzled in a heavy brush, the legs rather short and\r\nstraight with knees projecting a little and well separated, the feet\r\nnarrow and not inclined to spread in walking, the hoofs not being\r\nsplayed but consisting of light and even bones, and a hide which is\r\nnot rough and hard to the touch. The best colour is black, next red,\r\nthird chestnut and last white: for a white coat indicates weakness, as\r\nblack indicates endurance: of the other two colours red is more common\r\nthan chestnut, and both than black and white. In addition you should\r\nbe particular that the bull is of good breed, which is determined\r\nfrom his conformation and his get, as calves usually reproduce the\r\nqualities of their sire. And, finally, it is of importance whence they\r\ncome. Gallic cattle are considered in Italy to be the best for work,\r\nwhile on the other hand Ligurian cattle are worthless. The foreign\r\ncattle of Epirus are not only better than all the Greek cattle but\r\neven than the Italian: nevertheless, there are those who choose\r\nItalian cattle for victims and to serve as offerings to the gods on\r\naccount of their size: and without doubt they may be preferred for\r\nsuch holy offices, so great is the distinction of their majestic bulk\r\nand their candid coats: and they are the more suitable for such use\r\nbecause white cattle are not so common in Italy as in Thrace at the\r\ngulf of Melas, where there are few of any other colour.\r\n\r\n\"When cattle are bought already broken for work we stipulate thus: 'Do\r\nyou guarantee these cattle to be in good health and warrant me against\r\nliability for any tort committed by them?'\r\n\r\n\"When we buy them unbroken, we say: 'Do you guarantee these yearlings\r\nto be in good health and to come out of a healthy herd, and warrant me\r\nagainst liability for tort?'\r\n\r\n\"When butchers buy for the shambles they use a fuller formula\r\nrecommended by Manilius: but those who buy for the altar do not\r\nusually stipulate for health in their victims.\r\n\r\n\"Neat cattle pasture best in groves where there is brushwood and much\r\nleafage: and so when they are wintered by the sea they are driven up\r\nto pasture in summer in the hills where shrubbery abounds.\r\n\r\n\"These are my breeding rules:\r\n\r\n\"For a month before breeding I cut down the food and drink of the cows\r\nbecause it is deemed that they breed more certainly when they are\r\nthin. On the other hand, I fatten the bulls up on grass and straw and\r\nhay for two months before the breeding season, and during that time I\r\nkeep them apart from the cows. Like Atticus, I have two for seventy\r\ncows, one a yearling, the other two years old. When that constellation\r\nhas risen which the Greeks call Lyra, and we Romans, Fides, I turn\r\nthe bull into the herd again. The bull indicates whether a male or a\r\nfemale calf has been conceived by the side on which he leaves the cow:\r\nif male, on the right; if female, on the left. \"Why this is so,\" said\r\nVaccius, turning to me, \"I leave to you who read Aristotle.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cow should not be served under two years, so that she may have her\r\nfirst calf in the third year: it would be better in the fourth. Most\r\ncows bear for ten years, some even more. The most suitable time for\r\nstinting cows is during the forty days following the rising of the\r\nDolphin, or even a little later, for thus they will drop their calves\r\nat the most temperate season of the year, for a cow goes ten months\r\npregnant. On this subject I have come upon an extraordinary statement\r\nin a book that a bull which has just been altered can get a cow with\r\ncalf.\r\n\r\n\"Breeding cows should be pastured where there is abundant grass and\r\nplenty of water, and care should be taken to protect them from\r\ncrowding too close together, and from being struck, or from fighting\r\nwith one another: moreover, to protect them against being worried in\r\nsummer by cattle flies and those minute insects which get under their\r\ntails, some farmers shut them up during the heat of the day in pens,\r\nwhich should be strewn with leaves or some other bedding on which they\r\ncan rest comfortably. In summer they are driven to water twice a day,\r\nin winter once. Against the time when they are due to drop their\r\ncalves you should arrange to give them access to fresh forage near the\r\nstable which they can eat with appetite as they go out, for at that\r\ntime they are very dainty about their food. A watch out must be kept\r\nto prevent their frequenting chilly places, for cold depresses the\r\nvitality as much as hunger.\r\n\r\n\"These are the rules for raising neat cattle: the suckling calves\r\nshould not be suffered to sleep with their dams, for they might crush\r\nthem, but should be given access to them in the morning and when they\r\nreturn from pasture. When the calves are weaned the dams should be\r\ncomforted by having green stuff thrown into their stalls for them to\r\neat. The floor of a calf stable, like most others, should be paved\r\nwith stone to keep their hoofs from rotting. The calves may be\r\npastured with their dams after the autumn equinox. Bull calves should\r\nnot be altered before they are two years old, as they recover with\r\ndifficulty if the operation is performed sooner, while if it is done\r\nlater they are apt to be stubborn and useless.\r\n\r\n\"As in the case of other cattle, the herd should be gone over every\r\nyear and the culls thrown out because they occupy the room of those\r\nwhich might be profitable. If a cow loses her calf she should be given\r\nanother to nurse, taken from a cow which has not a sufficient supply\r\nof milk. Calves six months old are fed wheat bran and barley meal and\r\nyoung grass, and care should be taken that they are watered morning\r\nand evening.\r\n\r\n\"The rules for taking care of the health of neat cattle are many. I\r\nhave those which Mago has recorded written out and I take care that my\r\nherdsman reads them frequently.\r\n\r\n\"I have already said that a yearling and a two-year old bull should be\r\nprovided for every sixty cows, though some have more or less cows in\r\nthe herd: thus Atticus has two bulls for every seventy cows. Some\r\nobserve one rule as to the number of cattle to the herd, some another.\r\nI am among those who think that one hundred is enough, but Atticus\r\nhere, like Lucienus, has one hundred and twenty.\"\r\n\r\nSo far Vaccius.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of asses_\r\n\r\nVI. While Vaccius was speaking, Murrius had returned with Lucienus and\r\nnow began:\r\n\r\n\"I propose to tell about asses as well I may, because I am from Reate\r\nwhere the best and the largest are found; indeed, I have sold to the\r\nArcadians themselves asses of this race and of my own breeding. He who\r\nwishes to establish a good herd of asses should see in the first place\r\nthat he procures jacks and jennies of prime age so that they may breed\r\nas long as possible, strong, well made in all parts, of full body and\r\nof a good breed, that is to say derived from those localities whence\r\nthe best specimens come; thus the Peloponnesians, so far as possible,\r\nbuy asses bred in Arcadia and we in Italy those from the valley of\r\nReate. For if the best of those delicious fish we call _muraenae\r\nflutae_ are taken on the coast of Sicily and the best sturgeons at\r\nRhodes, it does not follow that they are of equal delicacy in all\r\nseas.\r\n\r\n\"There are two kinds of asses, one wild, which is called the onager,\r\nof which there, are many herds in Phrygia and Lycaonia; the other\r\ndomestic, as they are all over Italy. The onager is fit for use for\r\nbreeding because he is easily tamed and once domesticated never\r\nreverts to a wild life.[138]\r\n\r\n\"Because their young take after their parents, it is important to\r\nchoose both jack and jenny of good conformation. The conditions of\r\nbuying and selling asses are much the same as for other kinds of\r\ncattle and include stipulations as to their health and against tort.\r\nThey are best fed on corn and barley bran. The jennies are bred before\r\nthe solstice so that they may have their foals at the same season in\r\nthe following year, for their period of gestation is twelve months.\r\nThe jennies should be relieved from work while in foal for fatigue at\r\nthat time injures the offspring: but the jacks, on the contrary, are\r\nworked all the time, because it is lack of exercise which is bad for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of rearing, practically the same rules apply to asses as\r\nto horses. The foals are not separated from their dams for the first\r\nyear after they are born: during the second year they are permitted\r\nto stay with their dams at night, but they should then be tied with a\r\nloose halter or some other such restraint. In the third year you begin\r\nto break them for whatever service they are intended.\r\n\r\n\"As to the number: they are not usually kept in herds unless it may be\r\nfor transport service; generally they are used to turn the mill, or\r\nfor carrying about the farm, or even for the plough where the soil\r\nis light, as in Campania. Herds of asses are some times employed by\r\nmerchants, like those who transport wine, or oil, or corn, or any\r\nother commodity, from Brundisium or Apulia to the sea, by pack\r\ntrains.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of horses_\r\n\r\nVII. Here Lucienus took up the discourse. \"It is my turn,\" he said,\r\n\"to open the barrier and drive in my horses: and they are not only\r\nstallions, of which, like Atticus, I keep one for every ten breeding\r\nmares, but mares as well, such as Q. Modius Equiculus, that gallant\r\nsoldier, was wont to esteem for use even in war nearly as much as\r\nstallions.[139]\r\n\r\n\"He who wishes to have such studs of stallions and mares as may be seen\r\nin Peloponnesus and in Apulia should first consider age and see that\r\nhe obtains them not less than three nor more than ten years old. The\r\nage of a horse, as also of nearly all animals whose hoofs are not\r\ncloven, even horned animals, may be known from the condition of the\r\nteeth: thus at thirty months of age a colt is said to lose the milk\r\nincisors from the middle of his mouth, two above and two below. At the\r\nbeginning of the fourth year, in like manner he sheds the same number,\r\nbeing the incisors adjoining those previously lost, and at that age\r\nalso the teeth called canine begin to appear. At the beginning of the\r\nfifth year he loses two more incisors, and at that time the new teeth\r\nshow hollow. In the sixth year the new teeth begin to fill out their\r\ncavities, and by the seventh usually all have been renewed and the\r\npermanent mouth is made. What is the age of a horse beyond this point\r\nit is not possible to determine accurately, except that when the teeth\r\nproject and the eye brows are white and have hollows under them, it is\r\nconsidered that a horse is sixteen years old.\r\n\r\n\"A breeding mare should be of medium size, for it is not fitting that\r\nthey should be either very large or very small, but the quarters and\r\nbelly should be broad.\r\n\r\n\"A breeding stallion on the other hand should be chosen with a large\r\nbody, well made and all his parts in harmony. What sort of horse it\r\nwill turn out to be can be determined from the points of the foal, for\r\nit should exhibit a small head: limbs well knit together: a black eye,\r\nwide nostrils: ears well pricked: a mane which is thick, dark and\r\ncurly, of fine hairs and falling on the right side of the neck: a\r\nbreast broad and well developed: strong shoulders: a moderate belly:\r\nthe loins flat and rising to the quarters: long shoulder blades: a\r\nback bone well doubled [with ridges of meat] but if these are not\r\nprominent in no event should the bone itself stand out: a tail large\r\nand curly: legs straight and even and rather long: knees round and\r\nsmall and not turned in as you look at them: hard hoofs: veins visible\r\nall over the body (for a horse of this kind is fit for treatment when\r\nhe is sick).\r\n\r\n\"The breed is of the greatest importance, for there are many. In this\r\nrespect the celebrated breeds take the names of the countries from\r\nwhich they come: thus in Greece we have the Thessalian breed: in Italy\r\nthe Apulian from Apulia, and the Rosean from Rosea.[140]\r\n\r\n\"It is a sign that they will make good horses if, when at pasture\r\nwith the herd, the colts contend with one another for superiority in\r\nrunning or in any thing else, or if when a stream is to be crossed\r\nthey leap it at the head of the herd and do not look back for the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Horses are bought in almost the same manner as cattle or asses,\r\nbecause they change ownership by similar formalities, all of which are\r\nset forth in the book of Manilius.\r\n\r\n\"Horses should be pastured whenever possible in meadows of grass, and\r\nin the stable and stall they are fed on hay.\r\n\r\n\"When a mare has foaled she should be fed on barley and watered twice a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of breeding, the period of service is from the vernal\r\nequinox to the solstice so that the foal may come at a suitable\r\nseason, for they are supposed to be born on the tenth day of the\r\ntwelfth month after the mare was stinted. Those which are born after\r\nthe time are usually defective and unfit for use. When the season has\r\ncome the stallion should be admitted to the mare twice a day, in the\r\nmorning and in the evening, under the direction of the _origa_ (so the\r\nstudgroom is called), for a mare held in hand is stinted more quickly,\r\nnor does the stallion waste his seed by excess of ardor. When a mare\r\nis stinted she makes it known by defending herself. If the stallion\r\nshows an aversion for a mare, her parts should be smeared when she\r\nis in heat with the marrow of a shrimp macerated in water to the\r\nconsistency of honey, and the stallion allowed to smell of it.\r\n\r\n\"Although it may seem incredible, what I am about to relate is true and\r\nshould be remembered. Once upon a time a studgroom tried to make a\r\nstallion cover his mother, but could never get him to come near her:\r\nso one day the groom muffled the stallion's head and put him to his\r\nmother successfully: but when the bandage was removed and the stallion\r\nsaw what he had done, he fell upon the groom and killed him with his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\"When the mares have been stinted it must be seen to that they are\r\nworked only in moderation and are kept out of cold places, because\r\ncold is of the greatest prejudice to a mare in that condition. For\r\nthis reason the floor of their stable should be kept dry and the\r\nwindows and doors should be kept shut: and furthermore the mares\r\nshould be separated one from another by long poles fastened back from\r\nthe manger so that they may not fight.\r\n\r\n\"Mares in foal should neither be over-fed nor starved.\r\n\r\n\"There are some who breed their mares only every other year and claim\r\nthey get better colts, on the same principle that as corn land is\r\nexhausted by continuous cropping, so is a mare which is bred every\r\nyear.[141]\r\n\r\n\"The foal should be led out to pasture with its dam on the tenth day\r\nafter it is born, so to avoid burning its tender hoofs by standing\r\non manure in the stable. When five months old a colt should be fed,\r\nwhenever he is brought into the stable, a ration of barley meal whole\r\nwith its bran, or any other product of the earth which he will eat\r\nwith appetite. When they are a year old they may be fed barley in the\r\ngrain mixed with bran, and this should be kept up as long as they\r\nsuckle, for they should not be weaned until they have completed the\r\nsecond year. From time to time while they are still with their dams\r\nthey should be handled so that they may not be wild after they are\r\nseparated. To the same end it is well to hang bridles in their stalls\r\nso that while they are still colts they may become accustomed to the\r\nsight of them and the sound of their clanking as well. When a colt has\r\nlearned to come to an outstretched hand you should put a boy on his\r\nback, for the first two or three times stretched out flat on his\r\nbelly, but afterwards sitting upright. The time to do this is when\r\nthe colt is three years old, for then he has his full growth and is\r\nbeginning to develop muscles.\r\n\r\n\"There are those who say that a colt may be broken at eighteen months,\r\nbut it is better to wait until the third year. Then is the time too\r\nto begin to feed him that mixture of grain in the milk which we call\r\n_farrago_, for this is very good for a horse as a purgative. It\r\nshould be fed for ten days to the exclusion of all other food. On the\r\neleventh day and until the fourteenth you should feed barley, adding a\r\nlittle to the ration every day for four days and then maintaining that\r\nquantity for the ten days succeeding: during this period the horse\r\nshould be exercised moderately, and when in a sweat rubbed down with\r\noil. If it is cold a fire should be lit in the stable.\r\n\r\n\"As some horses are suitable for military service, some for the cart,\r\nsome for breeding, some for racing, and others for the carriage, it\r\nfollows that the methods of handling and looking after them all are\r\nnot the same. Thus the soldier chooses some and rears and trains them\r\nfor his particular use, and so in turn does the charioteer and the\r\ncircus rider. Nor does he who wishes a cart horse choose the same\r\nconformation or give the same training as to a horse intended for the\r\nsaddle or the carriage: for as the one desires mettle for military\r\nservice, the other prefers a gentle disposition for use on the road.\r\nIt was to provide for this difference of use that the practice of\r\ncastrating horses was inaugurated, for horses that are altered are of\r\na quieter disposition: they are called geldings, as hogs in the same\r\nstate are called barrows and chickens are called capons.\r\n\r\n\"As to medicine for the horse, there are so many symptoms of their\r\nmaladies and so many cures that the studgroom must have them written\r\ndown: indeed, on this account in Greece the veterinarians are mostly\r\ncalled [Greek: hippiatroi] (horse leeches).\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of mules_\r\n\r\nVIII. While we were talking a freedman came from Menas and said that\r\nthe sacrificial cakes were cooked and every thing ready for the\r\nsacrifice--that whoever wishes to take part had only to come.\r\n\r\n\"But I will not suffer you to go,\" I protested, \"until you have\r\nfulfilled your promise and given me the third chapter of our subject,\r\nthat concerning mules and dogs and shepherds.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be said about mules,\"[142] replied Murrius, \"may be said\r\nbriefly. Mules and hinnies are mongrels and grafts as it were on a\r\nstock of a different species, for a mule is got by an ass out of a\r\nmare, and a hinny by a horse out of a she ass. Both have their uses,\r\nbut neither is fit to reproduce its kind. For this purpose it is the\r\ncustom to put a newborn ass colt to nurse to a mare because mares'\r\nmilk will make it more vigorous: it is considered better than asses'\r\nmilk, or indeed than any other kind of milk. Later they are fed on\r\nstraw, hay and barley. The foster mother must be given good attention\r\nalso, as she must bring up her own colt in addition to her service as\r\na wet nurse. An ass raised in this way is fit to get mules when he is\r\nthree years old, nor will he contemn the mares because he has become\r\nused to their kind. If you use him for breeding earlier he will\r\nquickly exhaust himself and his get will be poor.\r\n\r\n\"If you have no ass foal to have brought up by a mare and you wish a\r\nbreeding jackass, you should buy the largest and handsomest you can\r\nfind; the best breed, as the ancients said, was that of Arcadia, but\r\nnowadays we who know maintain that the breed of Reate is best: where\r\nbreeding jacks have brought thirty and even forty thousand sesterces\r\n($1,800-$2,000).\r\n\r\n\"Jacks are bought like horses, with the same stipulations and\r\nguarantees. We feed them principally on hay and barley, increasing the\r\nration at the breeding season so as to infuse strength into their get\r\nby means of their food. The breeding season is the same as for horses,\r\nand, like them again, we have the jack handled by a studgroom.\r\n\r\n\"When a mare has dropped a mule colt or filly we bring it up with care.\r\nThose which are born in marshy and swampy country have soft hoofs, but\r\nif they are driven up into the mountain in summer, as we do at Reate,\r\ntheir hoofs become hardened.\r\n\r\n\"In buying mules you must consider age and conformation, the one that\r\nthey may be able to work under a load, the other that the eye may have\r\npleasure in looking at them: for a team of two good mules is capable\r\nof drawing any kind of a wagon on the road.\r\n\r\n\"You, my friend from Reate,\" Murrius added, turning to me, \"can vouch\r\nfor what I have said, as you yourself have herds of breeding mares at\r\nhome and have bred and sold many mules.\r\n\r\n\"The get of a horse out of a she ass is called a hinny: he is smaller\r\nin the body and usually redder in colour than a mule, and has ears\r\nlike a horse, but mane and tail like an ass. Hinnies are carried by\r\nthe dam twelve months, like a horse, and, like the horse too, they are\r\nraised and fed, and their age can be told by their teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of herd dogs_\r\n\r\nIX. \"It remains,\" said Atticus, \"to speak of the last of the\r\nquadrupeds on our programme, that is to say, of dogs, which are of the\r\ngreatest importance to us who feed the woolly flock, for the dog is\r\nthe guardian of such cattle as lack the means to defend themselves,\r\nchiefly sheep and goats. For the wolf is wont to lie in wait for\r\nthem and we oppose our dogs to him as defenders. Hogs can defend\r\nthemselves, as well pigs, boars, barrows and sows, for they are near\r\nakin to the wild boar, which we know often kills dogs in the woods,\r\nwith their tusks. What shall I say of large cattle? I know of an\r\ninstance of a herd of mules pastured together, which, when they were\r\nattacked by a wolf, joined in forming a circle about him and killed\r\nhim with blows of their hoofs: and again, bulls often stand together,\r\nrump to rump, and drive off wolves with their horns. But of dogs there\r\nare two kinds, hunting dogs, which are used against wild beasts and\r\ngame, and herd dogs, which are used by the shepherd. I will discuss\r\nthe latter methodically, following Scrofa's nine heads.\r\n\r\n\"Of the first importance is the choice of dogs of suitable age, for\r\npuppies and old dogs cannot protect themselves, much less the sheep,\r\nand so often become themselves the prey of wild beasts.\r\n\r\n\"In appearance they should be handsome, of good size, with black or\r\ntawny eyes: a symmetrical nose: lips blackish or ruddy, neither drawn\r\nback above nor hanging underneath: a short muzzle, showing two teeth\r\non either side, those of the lower jaw projecting a little, those\r\nabove rather straight and not so apparent, and the other teeth, which\r\nare covered by the lips, very sharp: a large head, ears large and\r\nturned over: a thick crest and neck: long joints: straight legs,\r\nrather bowed than knock-kneed: feet large and well developed, so that\r\nin walking they may spread out: toes slightly splayed: claws hard and\r\ncurved: the pad of the foot neither horny nor hard but as it were\r\npuffed and soft: short-coupled: a back bone neither projecting nor\r\nroached: a heavy tail: a deep bark, and wide gaping chops. The colour\r\nto be preferred is white because it gives the dog a lion-like aspect\r\nin the dark.[143] Finally, the females should have large teats equally\r\ndistributed. Care should be taken that they are of good breed, such\r\nas those called for their place of origin, Laconian, Epirot and\r\nSallentian. Be careful not to buy a sheep dog from a professional\r\nhunter or a butcher, because the one is apt to be lazy about following\r\nthe flock, while the other is more likely to make after a hare or a\r\ndeer which it might see, than to tend the sheep.\r\n\r\n\"It is better either to buy, from a shepherd, dogs which are accustomed\r\nto follow sheep or dogs which are without any training at all. While a\r\ndog does readily whatever he has been trained to do, his affection is\r\napt to be stronger for the shepherds than for the flock.[144]\r\n\r\n\"Once P. Aufidius Pontianus of Amiternum bought certain flocks of sheep\r\nin further Umbria, the dogs which herded them being included in\r\nthe bargain, but not the shepherds, who were, however, to make the\r\ndelivery at the Saltus of Metapontum and the market of Heraclea: when\r\nthese shepherds had returned home, their dogs, longing for their\r\nmasters, a few days later of their own will came back to the shepherds\r\nin Umbria, having made several days journey without other food than\r\nwhat the fields afforded. Nor had any one of those shepherds done what\r\nSaserna advises in his books on agriculture,\r\n\r\n    'Whoever wishes to be followed by a dog should throw him a cooked\r\n    frog.'[145]\r\n\r\n\"It is of importance that all your dogs should be of the same breed,\r\nfor when they are related they are of the greatest aid to one another.\r\n\r\n\"Now as to Scrofa's fourth consideration, that concerning the manner of\r\nbuying: this is accomplished by delivery by the former owner to the\r\npurchaser.\r\n\r\n\"The same stipulations as to health and against liability for tort are\r\nmade as in the case of cattle, leaving out whatever is inapplicable to\r\ndogs. Some make a price on dogs at so much per head, others stipulate\r\nthat the puppies shall go with the mother, others that two puppies\r\nshall count as one dog--as two lambs usually count as a sheep. Usually\r\nit is provided that all the dogs which have been accustomed to be\r\ntogether should be included in the bargain.\r\n\r\n\"The food appropriate for dogs is more like that of man than of sheep,\r\nfor they are fed on scraps and bones rather than on grass and leaves.\r\nCare must be taken that they are fed regularly, for, if food is not\r\nprovided, hunger will lead them in search of it away from the\r\nflock, unless, indeed, they shall find it in one another, thereby\r\ncontradicting the old proverb,[146] or perchance they may realize the\r\nfable of Actaeon and turn their teeth against their master himself.\r\nYou would do well to feed them on barley bread soaked in milk, because\r\nwhen they have become accustomed to that diet they will not readily\r\ndesert the flock. They should never be suffered to taste the flesh of\r\na carrion sheep lest the relish should tempt them to indulge in such\r\nfood again. They may be fed also broth made out of bones, or bones\r\nthemselves when broken up, for that makes their teeth stronger and the\r\nmouth wider: and thereby the jaws are stretched, while the zest of the\r\nmarrow makes the dog fiercer. They should be accustomed to take their\r\nfood in the day time where the flock is feeding and at night where the\r\nflock is folded.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of breeding it is the practice to line the bitch at the\r\nbeginning of spring, for then she is said to be in heat, that is to\r\nsay, to show a readiness for breeding. When they are lined at this\r\nseason they pup about the solstice, for they go three months. While\r\nthey are in pup they should be fed barley bread rather than wheat\r\nbread, for it is more nourishing and makes more milk.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of bringing up the puppies after birth: if there are\r\nmany in the litter you should choose those you wish to keep and\r\ndestroy the others: the fewer you keep the better they will be\r\nnourished, for then their portion of the mother's milk will be larger.\r\n\r\n\"Chaff or some thing else of that sort should be spread under them,\r\nbecause the better they are bedded the more easily they are brought\r\nup. Puppies open their eyes twenty days after birth.[147] During the\r\nfirst two months they are not separated from their mother, but wean\r\nthemselves gradually. A number of puppies should be kenneled together,\r\nwhere they may be encouraged to fight, which will make them fiercer,\r\nbut they should never be suffered to tire themselves since weariness\r\ndevelops cowardice. They should also be accustomed to be tied, at\r\nfirst with a light leash, and if they attempt to gnaw it they should\r\nbe punished by whipping, so that they may not get the habit. On rainy\r\ndays their kennels should be bedded with leaves or grass, for two\r\nreasons: that they may not soil themselves or suffer from cold. Some\r\ncastrate their puppies thinking them less likely to leave the flock,\r\nbut others do not, thinking that the operation makes them less fierce.\r\nSome rub their ears and between their toes with a suffusion of bitter\r\nalmonds steeped in water because flies, ticks and fleas usually\r\ndevelop sores in those parts, unless it is your practice to so anoint\r\nthem. To protect them from wounds from wild beasts we place collars on\r\nthem, of the kind which we call _melium_, which is a girth around the\r\nneck made from strong leather studded with nails and lined with soft\r\nleather to protect the neck from being chafed by the hard iron heads\r\nof the nails: for if a wolf or other wild beast is once wounded by\r\nthese nails all the other dogs are safe from his attack, even if they\r\nhave no collars.\r\n\r\n\"The number of dogs to be kept is determined by the size of the flock,\r\nusually one dog for every shepherd is considered enough, but the\r\npractice varies. Thus there should be more in localities where wild\r\nbeasts are plentiful, and those increase the number also who are wont\r\nto drive their flocks over the long forest drift ways to their summer\r\nor their winter feeding grounds.\r\n\r\n\"But two dogs are enough for a flock kept on a farm: in which case\r\nthey should be male and female, for they are more attached and, by\r\nemulation, fiercer, and if one is sick for a protracted time the flock\r\nwill not be without a dog.\"\r\n\r\nHere Atticus looked around as if to enquire whether he had omitted any\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"This is the silence,\" said I, \"which summons another player on the\r\nboards.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of shepherds_\r\n\r\nX. \"The rest of this act,\" I added, \"relates to how many and what kind\r\nof shepherds are necessary.\"\r\n\r\nCossinius took the cue. \"For large cattle,\" he said, \"men of full age\r\nare required; for small cattle boys will do: but in either case those\r\nwho drive their flocks and herds on the drift ways must be stouter\r\nthan those who remain on the farm and return to the steading every\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"So in the wood pastures _(saltus)_ it behooves one to have young men\r\nand usually armed men, while on the farm boys or even girls may tend\r\nthe flock. Those who use the distant feeding grounds should require\r\ntheir shepherds to feed their flocks together all day, but at night\r\nto remain each one with his own flock. They should all be under\r\nthe supervision of one flock master, who should be older and more\r\nexperienced than the others, because they will obey more cheerfully\r\none who surpasses them in age and knowledge; and yet the flock master\r\nshould be of such years that he may not be prevented by age from hard\r\nwork: for neither old men nor boys can endure the steeps of the drift\r\nways, nor the ardours and roughness of the mountains, which must be\r\nsuffered by those who follow flocks, especially cattle and goats, to\r\nwhom the rocks and the forests are pleasant grazing places.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns the conformation of the men chosen for these\r\noccupations, they should be strong and swift and active, with ready\r\nlimbs not only able to follow the cattle but to defend them from the\r\nincursions of wild beasts and of brigands: men who can load the packs\r\non the sumpter beasts: can run and throw a javelin.[148]\r\n\r\n\"Every nation is not fit for tending cattle, especially the Basculi and\r\nthe Turduli [of Spain]. The Gauls are the best of all, particularly\r\nfor draught cattle.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of the purchase of shepherds, there are six usual\r\nmethods of obtaining lawful title to a slave: (i) by inheritance, (2)\r\nby due form of mancipation, which is delivery of possession by one\r\nwho has the legal right, (3) by the legal process called surrender in\r\ncourt (_cessio in jure_) from one who has that right, the transfer\r\ntaking place where it should, (4) by prescriptive use (_usucapion_),\r\n(5) by purchase of a prisoner of war \"under the crown\" (6) by auction\r\nat the distribution of some one's property by order of court under the\r\nprocess known as _bonorum emptio_.[149]\r\n\r\n\"The _peculium_ or personal property of the slave usually passes with\r\nhim to a new master unless it is specially excepted in the terms of\r\nsale: there is also the usual guaranty as to the health of the slave\r\nand that he has committed no theft or tort for which his master is\r\nlegally responsible, and, unless the purchase is by mancipation, the\r\nbargain is bound by an obligation of double indemnity, or in the\r\namount of the purchase price alone, if that is the agreement.\r\n\r\n\"The shepherds should take their meals separately during the day, each\r\none with his flock, but in the evening they should meet at a common\r\nsupper under the supervision of the flock master.[150] It should be the\r\nduty of the flock master to see that every thing is provided which may\r\nbe required by the flock or by the shepherds, chiefly the victuals\r\nfor the men and medicine for the flock: for which the master should\r\nprovide beasts of burden, either horses or some thing else which can\r\ncarry a load on its back.\r\n\r\n\"As to what relates to the breeding of shepherds, it is easy, so far as\r\nconcerns those who remain on the farm all the time because they can\r\nhave a fellow servant to wife at the farmstead, for Venus Pastoralis\r\ndemands no more. Some hold that it is expedient also to furnish\r\nwomen[151] for those who pasture the flocks in the Saltus and the\r\nforests and have no residence but find their shelter from the rain\r\nunder improvised sheds: that such women following the flocks and\r\npreparing the food for the shepherds keep the men better satisfied and\r\nmore devoted to their duty. But they must needs be strong though not\r\ndeformed, and not less capable of work then the men themselves, as\r\nthey are in many localities and as may be seen throughout Illyricum,\r\nwhere the women feed the flocks or carry in wood for the fire and cook\r\nthe food, or keep watch over the household utensils in their cottages.\r\n\r\n\"As to the method of raising their children, it suffices to say that\r\nthe shepherd women are usually both mothers and nurses at the same\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nAt this Cossinius looked at me and said: \"I have heard you relate\r\nthat, when you were in Liburnia, you saw women big with child bringing\r\nin fire wood and at the same time carrying a nursing child, or even\r\ntwo of them, thus putting to shame those slender reeds, the women of\r\nour class, who are wont to lie abed under mosquito bars for days at a\r\ntime when they are pregnant.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" I replied, \"and the contrast is even more marked in\r\nIllyricum, where it often happens that a pregnant woman whose time has\r\ncome will leave her work for a little while and return with a new born\r\nchild which you would think she had found rather than borne.[152]\r\n\r\n\"Not only this, the custom of that country permits the girls as much as\r\ntwenty years of age, whom they call virgins, to go about unprotected\r\nand to give themselves to whomever they wish and to have children\r\nbefore marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"As to what pertains to the health of man and beast,\" resumed\r\nCossinius, \"and the leech craft which may be practised without the aid\r\nof a physician, the flock master should have the rules written down:\r\nindeed, the flock master must have some education, otherwise he can\r\nnever keep his flock accounts properly.[153]\r\n\r\n\"As to the number of shepherds, some make a narrow, some a broad,\r\nallowance. I have one shepherd for every eighty long wool sheep:\r\nAtticus here has one for every hundred. One can reduce the number\r\nof men required in respect of large flocks (like those containing\r\na thousand head or more) much more readily than in respect of\r\ncomparatively small flocks, like Atticus' and mine, for I have only\r\nseven hundred head of sheep, and you, Atticus, have, I believe, eight\r\nhundred, though we are alike in providing a ram for every ten ewes.\r\nTwo men are required to care for a herd of fifty mares: and each of\r\nthem should have a mare broken for riding to serve as a mount in those\r\nlocalities where it is the custom to drive the mares to pasture, as\r\noften happens in Apulia and Lucania.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of milk and cheese and wool_\r\n\r\nXI. \"And now that we have fulfilled our promise, let us go,\" said\r\nCossinius.\r\n\r\n\"Not until you have added some thing,\" I cried, \"concerning that\r\nsupplemental profit from cattle which was promised; namely, of milk\r\nand cheese and the shearing of wool.\"\r\n\r\nSo Cossinius resumed:\r\n\r\n\"Ewes' milk, and, after it, goats' milk, is the most nourishing of all\r\nliquids which we drink. As a purgative, mares' milk ranks first, and,\r\nafter it, in order, asses' milk, cows' milk and goats' milk, but\r\nthe quality depends upon what has been fed to the cattle, upon the\r\ncondition of the cattle, and upon when it is milked.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns the food of the cattle, milk is nourishing which\r\nis made from barley and stover and other such kinds of dry and hard\r\ncattle food.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns its purgative qualities, milk is good when made\r\nfrom green stuff, especially if it is grass containing plants which,\r\ntaken by themselves, have a purgative effect upon the human body.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns the condition of the cattle, that milk is best\r\nwhich comes from cattle in vigorous health and from those still young.\r\n\r\n\"So far as concerns the time of milking, that milk is best which comes\r\nneither from a 'stripper' nor from a recently fresh dam.\r\n\r\n\"The cheese made of cows' milk is the most agreeable to the taste but\r\nthe most difficult to digest: next, that of ewes' milk, while the\r\nleast agreeable in taste, but the most easily digested, is that of\r\ngoats' milk.\r\n\r\n\"There is also a distinction between cheese when it is soft and new\r\nmade and when it is dry and old, for when it is soft it is more\r\nnourishing and digestible, but the opposite is true of old and dry\r\ncheese.\r\n\r\n\"The custom is to make cheese from the rising of the Pleiades in spring\r\nto their rising in summer, and yet the rule is not invariable, because\r\nof difference in locality and the supply of forage.\r\n\r\n\"The practice is to add a quantity of rennet, equal to the size of an\r\nolive, to two _congii_ of milk to make it curdle. The rennet taken\r\nfrom the stomachs of the hare and the kid is better than that from\r\nlambs, but some use as a ferment the milk of the fig tree mixed with\r\nvinegar, and some times sprinkled with other vegetable products.\r\nIn parts of Greece this is called [Greek: opos], elsewhere [Greek:\r\ndakruos].\"\r\n\r\n\"I am prepared to believe,\" I said, \"that the fig tree standing beside\r\nthe chapel of the goddess Rumina[154] was planted by shepherds for the\r\npurpose you mention, for there is it the practice to make libations of\r\nmilk rather than of wine or to sacrifice suckling pigs. For men used\r\nto use the word _rumis_ or _ruma_ where we now say _mamma_, signifying\r\na teat: hence even now suckling lambs are called _subrumi_ from the\r\nteat they suck, just as we call suckling pigs _lactantes_ from _lac_,\r\nthe milk that comes from the teat.\"\r\n\r\nCossinius resumed:\r\n\r\n\"If you sprinkle your cheese with salt it is better to use the mineral\r\nthan the marine kind.\r\n\r\n\"Concerning the shearing of sheep, the first thing to be looked into\r\nbefore you begin is that the sheep are not suffering from scab or\r\nsores, as it is better to wait, if necessary, until they are cured\r\nbefore shearing.\r\n\r\n\"The time to shear is between the vernal equinox and the summer\r\nsolstice, when the sheep begin to sweat (it is the sweat which gives\r\nnew clipped wool its name _sucida_). As soon as the sheep are sheared\r\nthey are smeared with a mixture[155] of wine and oil, some add white\r\nwax and hogs' grease. If they are sheep which are kept blanketed, the\r\ninside of the blanket should be anointed with this mixture before it\r\nis put on again.\r\n\r\n\"If the sheep has suffered any wound during the shearing, it should be\r\ntreated with liquid tar.\r\n\r\n\"Long wool sheep are usually sheared about the time of the barley\r\nharvest: in some places before the hay harvest.\r\n\r\n\"Some men shear their sheep twice a year, as in hither Spain, investing\r\ndouble work because they think they get more wool, just as some men\r\nmow their meadows twice a year. Careful shepherds are wont to shear on\r\na mat so as not to lose any of the wool. A clear day should be chosen\r\nfor the shearing and it is usually done between the fourth and the\r\ntenth hours (10 a.m.-4 p.m.) since wool sheared in the hot sun is\r\nsofter, heavier and of better colour by reason of the sweat of the\r\nsheep. Wool which has been collected and packed in bags is called\r\n_vellera_ or _velamina_, words derived from _vellere_, to pull, whence\r\nit may be concluded that the practice of pulling wool is older than\r\nshearing. Those who pull the wool today make a practice of starving\r\ntheir sheep for three days before, because when they are weak the wool\r\nyields more readily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of shearing,\" I said, \"it is reported that the first\r\nbarbers were brought into Italy from Sicily in the year 453 after the\r\nfoundation of Rome (B.C. 300) by P. Ticinius Menas, as appears from\r\nthe inscription in the public square of Ardea. The statues of the\r\nancients show that formerly there were no barbers because most of them\r\nhave long hair and a heavy beard.\"[156]\r\n\r\nCossinius resumed:\r\n\r\n\"As the wool of the sheep serves to make clothes, so the hair of\r\ngoats is employed: on ships, in making military engines and certain\r\nimplements of industry. Certain nations, indeed, are clad in goat\r\nskins, as in Gaetulia and Sardinia. Their use for this purpose by\r\nthe ancient Greeks is apparent, because old men in the tragedies are\r\ncalled [Greek: diphtheriai], from the fact that they were clad in\r\ngoat skins: and it is the custom also in our comedies to dress rustic\r\ncharacters in goat skins, like the youth in the _Hypobolimaeus_ (the\r\nCounterfeit) of Caecilius, and the old man in the _Heautontimorumenos_\r\n(the Self Tormentor) of Terence.\r\n\r\n\"It is the practice to shear goats in the greater part of Phrygia\r\nbecause there the goats have heavy coats, of which cilicia (so called\r\nbecause the practice of shearing goats began in the city of that name)\r\nand other hair cloth materials of that kind are made.\"\r\n\r\nWith this Cossinius stopped, and, while he was waiting for criticism\r\nof what he had said, Vitulus' freedman, coming into town from the\r\ngardens [of his master] turned to us and said, \"I was on my way to\r\nyour house to invite you to come early so as not to shorten the\r\nholiday.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, my dear Turranius Niger, we separated: Scrofa and I going to\r\nthe gardens of Vitulus; the others, some home and some to see Menas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUSBANDRY OF THE STEADING\r\n\r\n\r\n_Introduction: the antiquity of country life_\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere are two modes of human life, my dear Pinnius, which are\r\nmanifestly as different in the time of their origin as they are in\r\ntheir habitat, that of the country and that of the town. Country life\r\nis much the more ancient, for time was when men lived altogether in\r\nthe country and had no towns: indeed, the oldest town in Greece,\r\naccording to the tradition, is the Boeotian Thebes, which was founded\r\nby King Ogyges, and in our own land that of Rome, founded by King\r\nRomulus of which now it may be affirmed with confidence, as was not\r\npossible when Ennius wrote:\r\n\r\n  \"'Tis seven hundred years, or more or less,\r\n  Since first illustrious Rome began her sway,\r\n  With hallowed augury.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if it is admitted that Thebes was founded before the deluge,\r\nwhich is known by Ogyges' name, its age is not more than about\r\ntwenty-one hundred years: and if that period is compared with the\r\nlapse of time since men began to cultivate the land and to live in\r\nhuts and hovels, knowing naught of city walls and gates, it is evident\r\nthat life in the country preceded life in town by a tale of immemorial\r\nyears. Nor is this to be wondered at since 'God made the country and\r\nman made the town.'[157] While the tradition is that all the arts were\r\ninvented in Greece within a thousand years, there never was a time\r\nwhen the earth could not be cultivated. And, as life in the country\r\nis the more ancient, so it is the better life: for it was not without\r\ngood reason that our ancestors were wont to plant colonies of citizens\r\nin the country, because by them they were both fed in times of peace\r\nand protected in times of war: nor was it without significance that\r\nthey called both the Earth and Ceres by the common name of Mother and\r\nesteemed that those who worshipped her lead a life at once pious and\r\nuseful and were the sole representatives left on earth of the race of\r\nSaturn. A proof of this is that the mysteries peculiar to the cult of\r\nCeres were called _Initia_, the very name indicating that they related\r\nto the beginning of things.\r\n\r\nA further proof that country life was earlier than that of town is\r\nfound in the name of the town of Thebes, which was bestowed from the\r\ncharacter of its situation rather than from the name of its founder:\r\nfor in the ancient language, and among the Aeolians who had their\r\norigin in Boeotia, a small hill is called _tebas_ without the\r\naspirate; and in the Sabine country, where Pelasgians from Greece\r\nsettled, they still have the same locution: witness that hill called\r\nTebae which stands in the Sabine country on the via Salaria not far\r\nfrom the mile stone of Reate. At first agriculture was conducted on so\r\nsmall a scale that it had little distinction, since those who followed\r\nit, being sprung from shepherds, at once sowed their corn and\r\npastured their flocks on the same land, but as later this art grew in\r\nimportance the husbandry of live stock was separated, and it befel\r\nthat some men were called farmers and others shepherds.\r\n\r\nThe art of feeding live stock should really be divided into two\r\nbranches, as is not yet fully appreciated, one relating to the stock\r\nkept at the steading, the other to the stock pastured in the fields.\r\nThe latter, which is designated by the name _pecuaria_, is well known\r\nand highly esteemed so that rich men, either lease or buy much\r\npasture land in order to carry it on: the other, which is known as\r\n_villatice_, has, because it seemed to be of less importance, been\r\ntreated by some as an incident of the husbandry of agriculture, when\r\nin fact it should be made a part of the husbandry of live stock: nor\r\nhas it been described separately and at length by any one, so far as I\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd so, as I think that there are three branches of farm management\r\nwhich are undertaken for profit, namely: agriculture, live stock and\r\nthe industries peculiar to the steading, I have planned three books,\r\nof which I have already written two, the first concerning the\r\nhusbandry of agriculture, which I dedicated to my wife Fundania, and\r\nthe second concerning the husbandry of live stock to Turranius Niger:\r\nthe third, relating to the profits of those industries which are\r\ncarried on at the steading, I now send herewith to you; for the fact\r\nthat we are neighbours and entertain a mutual affection seems to\r\ndemand that it should be dedicated to you above all others.\r\n\r\nAlthough you have a villa, which is remarkable for the beauty of its\r\nworkmanship within and without, and for the splendour of its mosaic\r\npavements, still you deem it to be bare unless you have the walls\r\ndecorated also with books: so in like manner that your villa may be\r\nmore distinguished by the profits you derive from it than by the\r\ncharacter of its construction, and that I may be of assistance to that\r\nend, so far as may be, I have sent you this book, which is a summary\r\nof some conversations which we have had on the subject of what makes\r\nthe perfectly equipped villa: and so I begin as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the definition of a Roman villa_\r\n\r\nII. The Senator Q. Axius, my fellow tribesman, and I had cast our\r\nvotes at the comitia for the election of aediles, and, although it was\r\nthe heat of the day, we wished to be on hand when the candidate whom\r\nwe were supporting should go home. So Axius said to me: \"What would\r\nyou think of taking shelter in the _villa publica_[158] while the votes\r\nare being sorted rather than in the booth of our candidate.\" \"I hold,\"\r\nsaid I, \"not only with the proverb that bad advice is worst for him\r\nwho gives it, but that good advice is good for both the giver and the\r\ntaker.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so we made our way to the _villa publica_, where we found Appius\r\nClaudius,[159] the Augur, seated on a bench waiting for any call for his\r\nservices by the Consul: on his left was Cornelius Merula (blackbird)\r\nof the Consular family of that name, and Fircellius Pavo (pea-cock)\r\nof Reate, and on his right Minutius Pica (mag-pie) and M. Petronius\r\nPasser (sparrow). When we had approached them Axius, smiling, said to\r\nAppius: \"May we come into your aviary where you are sitting among the\r\nbirds?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" replied Appius, \"and especially you who set before me\r\nsuch birds as still make my mouth water, when I was your guest a few\r\ndays ago at your Reatine villa on my way to lake Velinus to settle the\r\ncontroversy between the people of Interamna and Reate.[160]\r\n\r\n\"But\" he added, \"is not this villa, which our ancestors constructed,\r\nsimpler and so better than that elaborate one of yours at Reate: do\r\nyou see any where here any furniture of citrus wood or ormolu, any\r\ndecorations of vermillion or blue, any tessellations or mosaic work,\r\nall of which on the other hand were displayed in your house? And while\r\nthis is open to the entire people, yours is available to you alone:\r\nthis is the resort for the citizens after the comitia in the Campus\r\nMartius, and for all alike, while yours is reserved for mares and\r\nasses. And furthermore it should be considered that this building is\r\nuseful in carrying on the public business, for here the consuls review\r\nthe army on parade, here the arms are inspected, here the censors\r\nenumerate the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" retorted Axius, \"which is useful, this villa of yours\r\ngiving on the Campus Martius, more extravagantly arrayed with objects\r\nof art than all Reate put together, so bedizened is it with pictures\r\nand garnished with statues, or mine where there is no trace of the\r\nartists Lysippus or Antiphilus, but there are many of the farm hand\r\nand the shepherd?\r\n\r\n\"And since there can be no villa where there is no farm and that well\r\ncultivated, how can you call this house of yours a villa which has no\r\nland appurtenant to it and no cattle or horses? Again, tell me, pray,\r\nhow does your villa compare with that of your grandfather and great\r\ngrandfather, for one cannot see at yours, as one could always see at\r\ntheirs, cured hay in the mows, the vintage in the cellar, and the\r\nharvest in the granary? Because, forsooth, a house is situated out of\r\ntown, it is no more a villa for that reason than the houses of those\r\nwho dwell beyond the Porta Flumentaria or in the Aemiliana suburb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since it appears that I do not know what a villa is,\" replied Appius,\r\nsmiling, \"I wish you would be good enough to instruct me, so that I\r\nmay not make a fool of myself, as I am planning to buy from M. Seius\r\nhis villa at Ostia: for if a mere house is not a villa unless it is\r\nequipped with a jackass costing forty thousand sesterces ($2,000),\r\nlike that you showed me at your place, I fear that I would be making\r\na mistake in buying Seius' house on the shore at Ostia in the belief\r\nthat it is a villa. But it was our friend Merula here who put me in\r\nmind of buying this house, for he told me that he had spent several\r\ndays there and that he had never seen a more delightful villa, and yet\r\nhe saw there no paintings, nor any bronze or marble statues, neither\r\ndid he see any wine press, or oil mill, or oil jars.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what kind of a villa is this,\" said Axius, turning to Merula,\r\n\"where there are neither the ornaments of a town house nor the\r\nutensils of a farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you consider,\" said Merula, \"that your house on the bank of\r\nVelinus, which neither painter nor architect has ever seen, is any\r\nless a villa than the one you have in Rosea so elegantly decorated\r\nwith the work of an architect and which you share with your famous\r\njackass?\"\r\n\r\nAxius admitted, with a nod, that a simple farm house was as much\r\nentitled to be called a villa as any house which united the\r\ncharacteristics of both town and country, and asked what he deduced\r\nfrom this.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Merula. \"Why, if your estate in Rosea is to be approved\r\nby reason of the husbandry which you carry on, and is properly called\r\na villa because there cattle are fed and stabled, then, by the same\r\nreasoning, all those houses should be called villas in which large\r\nprofits are derived from husbandry: for what difference does it make\r\nwhether you derive your profit from sheep or from birds? Is the income\r\nany sweeter which comes from cattle in which bees are generated, than\r\nfrom the bees themselves, such as work in their hives at the villa of\r\nSeius? Do you sell to the butcher the hogs which you raise at your\r\nfarm for more than Seius sells his wild boars to the meat market?\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I any less able,\" replied Axius, \"to have these things at my farm\r\nat Reate: is Sicilian honey made at Seius' place and only Corsican\r\nhoney at Reate,[161] and does the mast which he buys for his wild boars\r\nmake them fat while that which I get for nothing from my woods makes\r\nmine lean?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Appius, \"Merula does not deny that you _can_ carry on at\r\nyour villa the kind of husbandry which Seius does at his, yet I myself\r\nhave seen that you don't.\r\n\r\n\"For there are two kinds of husbandry of live stock: one in the fields,\r\nas of cattle; and the other at the steading, as of chickens and\r\npigeons and bees and other such things which are usually kept at a\r\nvilla.\r\n\r\n\"About the latter, Mago the Carthaginian, and Cassius Dionysius and\r\nothers have treated specially in different parts of their books, and\r\nit would seem that Seius has read their precepts and so has learned\r\nhow to make more profit from his villa alone by such husbandry than\r\nothers make out of an entire farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" agreed Merula, \"for I have seen there great flocks of\r\ngeese, chickens, pigeons, cranes and pea-cocks: also dormice, fish,\r\nwild boars and other such game.[162] The freedman who keeps his books\r\nwhich Varro has seen, assured me when he was doing the honours in the\r\nabsence of his master, that Seius derives an income of more than fifty\r\nthousand sesterces ($2,500) per annum from his villa.\"\r\n\r\nAs Axius seemed astonished, I asked him: \"Surely you know the estate\r\nof my aunt in the Sabine country which is at the twenty-fourth mile\r\nstone from Rome on the via Salaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I do,\" Axius replied, \"for it is there that I am wont to\r\ndivide the day in summer on my way from Reate to town and to spend the\r\nnight when I come thence in winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I continued, \"in that villa there is an aviary from which\r\nI know that there were taken in one season five thousand thrushes,\r\nwhich, at three deniers apiece, means that that department of the\r\nestablishment brought in a revenue of sixty thousand sesterces that\r\nyear, or twice the yield of the entire two hundred jugera of your farm\r\nat Reate.\"[163]\r\n\r\n\"What, sixty thousand,\" exclaimed Axius, \"sixty thousand: you are\r\nmaking game of me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sixty thousand,\" I affirmed, \"but in order that you might realize\r\nsuch a lucky throw you will require either a public banquet or a\r\ntriumph on the scale of that of Scipio Metellus, or club dinners,\r\nwhich indeed have now become so frequent as to raise the price of\r\nprovisions of the market.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will perchance expect this return every year,\" said Merula, \"so I\r\ntrust that your aviary may not lead you into a loss. But surely in such\r\ngood times as these it could not happen that you would fail, except\r\nrarely, for what year is there that does not see such a feast or a\r\ntriumph, or club dinners, such as now-a-days consume victuals without\r\nnumber. Nay,\" he added, \"it seems that in our habit of luxury such a\r\npublic banquet is a daily occurrence within the gates of Rome.\"[164]\r\n\r\nTo supplement the examples of such profits: L. Albutius, a learned\r\nman and, as you know, the author of certain satires in the manner of\r\nLucilius, has said that the returns from feeding live stock on his\r\nAlban farm are always less than his income from his villa, for the\r\nfarm yields less than ten thousand sesterces and the villa more than\r\ntwenty. He even maintains that if he should establish a villa near\r\nthe sea in such a place as he might choose he could derive from it\r\nan income of more than a hundred thousand sesterces. Did not M. Cato\r\nrecently sell forty thousand sesterces worth of fishes from the fish\r\nponds of Lucullus after he had accepted the administration of his\r\nestate?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Merula,\" exclaimed Axius, \"take me, I beg of you, as your\r\npupil in the art of the husbandry of the steading.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will begin,\" replied Merula, \"as soon as you promise me a minerval\r\nin the form of a dinner.\"[165]\r\n\r\n\"You shall have it,\" said Axius, \"both today, and hereafter as well,\r\noff those delicacies you will teach me to rear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" replied Merula, \"that what you may offer me at the beginning\r\nof your experience with villa feeding will be dead geese or deceased\r\npea-cocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what difference will it make to you,\" retorted Axius, \"if I do\r\nserve you fish or fowl which has come to an untimely end: for in no\r\nevent could you eat them unless they were dead: but I beg you,\" he\r\nadded, \"matriculate me in the school of villa husbandry and expound to\r\nme the theory and the practice of it.\"\r\n\r\nMerula accepted the invitation cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Roman development of the industries of the steading_\r\n\r\nIII. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"you should know what kind of\r\ncreatures you may raise or feed in or about a villa, either for your\r\nprofit or for your pleasure. There are three divisions for this study:\r\npoultry houses, warrens and fish ponds.\r\n\r\n\"I include under the head of poultry houses the feeding of all kinds of\r\nfowls which are usually kept within the walls of a steading: under the\r\nhead of warrens not merely what our great grandfathers meant--places\r\nwhere rabbits were usually kept--but any enclosure adjoining a villa\r\nin which game animals are enclosed to be fed. In like manner I include\r\nunder the head of fish ponds all those places in which fish are kept\r\nat a villa either in fresh or salt water.\r\n\r\n\"Each of these divisions may be separated into at least two parts: thus\r\nthe first, that with respect to poultry houses, should be treated with\r\nreference to a classification of fowls as between those which are\r\ncontent on land alone, such as pea-cocks, turtle doves, thrushes; and\r\nthose which require access to water as well as land, such as geese,\r\nwidgeons and ducks. So the second division, that relating to game, has\r\ntwo different classifications: one which includes the wild boar, the\r\nroe buck and hares; the other bees, snails and dormice.\r\n\r\n\"The third, or aquatic division, likewise has two classifications, one\r\nincluding fresh water fish, the other salt water fish.\r\n\r\n\"In order to secure and maintain a supply of these six classes of stock\r\nit is necessary to provide a force of three kinds of artificers,\r\nnamely: fowlers, hunters and fishermen, or else you may buy breeding\r\nstock from such men, and trust to the diligence of your servants to\r\nrear and fatten their offspring until they are ready for market.\r\nCertain of them, such as dormice, snails and chickens, may, however,\r\nbe obtained without the aid of a hunter's net, and doubtless the\r\nbusiness of keeping them began with the stock native to every farm:\r\nfor the breeding even of chickens has not been a monopoly of the Roman\r\naugurs, to make provision for their auspices, but has been practised\r\nby all farmers from the beginning of time.[166] From such a start in the\r\nkind of husbandry we are now discussing, the next step was to provide\r\nmasonry enclosures near the steading to confine game, and these served\r\nas well for shelter for the bee-stand, for originally the bees were\r\nwont to make their hives under the eaves of the farm house itself.\r\n\r\n\"The third division, that of keeping fish, had its origin in simple\r\nfresh water ponds in which fish taken in the streams were kept.\r\n\r\n\"There have been two steps in the development of each of these three\r\nconveniences; the earlier distinguished by the ancient simplicity,\r\nthe later by our modern luxury. The earlier stage was that of our\r\nancestors, who had but two places for keeping poultry: one the court\r\nyard of the steading in which chickens were fed and their profit\r\nderived from eggs and pullets, the other above ground, for their\r\npigeons were kept in the dormers or on the roof of the farm house.\r\n\r\n\"Now-a-days, on the contrary, what our ancestors called hen-houses are\r\nknown as _ornithones_, and serve to house thrushes and pea-cocks\r\nto cater to the delicate appetite of the master: and indeed such\r\nstructures now have larger roofs than formerly sufficed to cover an\r\nentire farm house.\r\n\r\n\"Such has been the progress in respect of warrens also: your father,\r\nAxius, never saw any game but rabbits, nor did there exist in his time\r\nany such extensive enclosures as now are made, many jugera in extent,\r\nto hold wild boars and roe bucks. You can witness,\" he said, turning\r\nto me, \"that you found many wild boars in the warren of your farm at\r\nTusculum, when you bought it from M. Piso.\"\r\n\r\nIn respect of the third class, who was there who used to have any kind\r\nof a fish pond, except of fresh water, stocked merely with cat fish\r\nand mullets, while today our elegants declare that they would as soon\r\nhave a pond stocked with frogs as with those fish I have named. You\r\nwill recall the story of Philippus when he was entertained at Casinum\r\nby Ummidius: a pickerel caught in your river, Varro, was put before\r\nhim, he tasted it and forthwith spat it out, exclaiming \"May I perish,\r\nbut I thought it was fish!\"[167]\r\n\r\nAs the luxury of this age has enlarged our warrens, so has it carried\r\nour fish ponds even to the sea itself and has herded shoals of sea\r\nfish into them. Have not Sergius Orata (goldfish) and Licinius Murena\r\n(lamprey) taken their cognomens from fishes for this reason? And who\r\ndoes not know the fame of the fish ponds of Philippus, of Hortensius,\r\nand of the brothers Lucullus?\r\n\r\n\"Where, then, Axius, do you wish me to begin?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of aviaries_\r\n\r\nIV. \"I prefer,\" replied Axius, \"that you should begin with the\r\nsequel--_postprincipia_, as they say in the camps--that is, with\r\nthe present day rather than with the past, because the profits from\r\npea-cocks are greater than those from hens, I will not dissemble that\r\nI wish to hear first of _ornithones_ because the thrushes which are\r\nkept in them make the very name sound like money: indeed, the 60,000\r\nsesterces of Fircelina have consumed me with avarice.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two kinds of _ornithones_,\" replied Merula; \"one for\r\npleasure, like that so much admired which our friend Varro here has at\r\nhis villa near Casinum: the other for profit, such as are maintained\r\ncommercially, some even indoors in town, but chiefly in the Sabine\r\ncountry which abounds in thrushes. There is a third kind, consisting\r\nof a combination of the two I have mentioned, such as Lucullus\r\nmaintained at his Tusculan villa, where he contrived a dining room\r\nunder the same roof as his aviary to the end that he might feast\r\ndelicately, satisfying two senses, now by eating the birds cooked and\r\nspread on a platter, now by seeing them flying about the windows: but\r\nthe truth is that he was disappointed, for the eyes did not take as\r\nmuch pleasure from the sight of the flying birds as the nostrils were\r\noffended by their odour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_a. For profit_\r\n\r\nV. \"But, as I gather you would prefer, Axius, I will speak of that kind\r\nof _ornithon_ which is established for profit, whence, but not where,\r\nfat thrushes are served.\r\n\r\n\"For this purpose is built a dome, in the form of a peristyle, with\r\na roof over it and enclosed with netting, sufficiently large to\r\naccommodate several thousand thrushes[168] and blackbirds; indeed, some\r\nalso include other kinds of birds, such as ortolans and quail, which\r\nsell for a good price when fat. Into this enclosure water should be\r\nconducted through a conduit and so disposed as to wind through the\r\naviary in channels narrow enough to be cleaned easily (for if the\r\nwater spreads out it is quickly polluted and rendered unfit to drink)\r\nand draining like a running stream to find its vent through another\r\nconduit, so that the birds may not be exposed to the risk of mud. The\r\ndoor should be low and narrow and well balanced on its hinges like\r\nthe doors they have in the amphitheatres where bulls are fought: few\r\nwindows and so placed that the birds cannot see trees and wild birds\r\nwithout, for that makes the prisoners pine and grow thin. The place\r\nshould have only so much light as may be necessary to enable the birds\r\nto see where they are to perch and to eat and drink. The doors and the\r\nwindows should be lightly stuccoed round about to keep out rats and\r\nother such vermin.\r\n\r\n\"Around the wall of the building on the inside are fastened many\r\nperches where the birds can sit, and another such convenience should\r\nbe contrived from poles set on the ground and leaning against the\r\nwalls and tied together with other poles fastened transversely at\r\nregular intervals, thus giving the appearance of the rising degrees of\r\na theatre. Down on the ground near the drinking water you should place\r\nthe birds' food, which usually consists of little balls of a paste\r\nmade out of figs and corn meal: but for twenty days before you intend\r\nto market your thrushes it is customary to feed them more heavily,\r\nboth by giving them more food and that chiefly of finer meal.\r\n\r\n\"In this enclosure there should also be cages with wooden floors which\r\nmay serve the birds as resting places supplementing the perches.\r\n\r\n\"Next to the aviary should be contrived a smaller structure, called the\r\n_seclusorium_, in which the keeper may array the birds found dead, to\r\nrender an account of them to his master, and where he may drive the\r\nbirds which are ready for market from the larger aviary: and to this\r\nend this smaller room is connected with the main cage by a large door\r\nand has more light: and there, when he has collected the number he\r\nwishes to market, the keeper kills them, which is done secretly, lest\r\nthe others might despond at the sight and themselves die before they\r\nare ready for market.\r\n\r\n\"Thrushes are not like other birds of passage which lay their eggs in\r\nparticular places, as the swan does in the fields and the swallows\r\nunder the roof, but they lay anywhere: for, despite their masculine\r\nname (_turdus_) there are female thrushes, just as there are male\r\nblackbirds, although they have a purely feminine name (_merula_).\r\n\r\n\"All birds are divided as between those which are of passage, like\r\nswallows and cranes, and those which are domestic, like chickens and\r\npigeons: thrushes are birds of passage and every year fly from across\r\nthe sea into Italy about the time of the autumn equinox, returning\r\nabout the spring equinox. At another season doves and quail do the\r\nsame in immense numbers, as may be seen in the neighbouring islands of\r\nPontia, Palmaria and Pandataria, for there they are wont to rest a few\r\ndays on their arrival and again before they set out across the sea\r\nfrom Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_b. For pleasure_\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Appius to Axius, \"if you enclose five thousand thrushes\r\nin such an aviary as Merula has described and there happens to be a\r\nbanquet or a triumph, you will gain forthwith that sixty thousand\r\nsesterces which you so keenly covet and be able to lend the money out\r\nat good interest.\" And then, turning to me, he added, \"Do you tell us\r\nof that other kind of ornithon, namely: for pleasure merely, for it is\r\nsaid that you have constructed one near Casinum which surpasses not\r\nonly the original built by the inventor of such flying cages, our\r\nfriend M. Laenius Strabo of Brundisium (who was the first to keep\r\nbirds confined in the chamber of a peristyle and to feed them through\r\nthe net), but also the vast structures of Lucullus at Tusculum.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" I said, \"that there flows through my estate near\r\nCasinum[169] a stream which is both deep and clear and fifty-seven feet\r\nwide between the masonry embankments, so that it is necessary to use\r\nbridges to get from one part of the property to the other. On the\r\nupper reach of this stream is situated my Museum[170] and at a distance\r\nof 950 feet below is an island formed by the confluence of another\r\nstream. Along the bank for this distance is an uncovered walk ten feet\r\nbroad and between this walk and the field is the location of my aviary\r\nenclosed on both sides, right and left, with high masonry walls. The\r\n_ornithon_ itself is built in the shape of a writing tablet with a\r\ncapital on it, the main quadrangle being forty-eight feet wide and\r\nseventy-two feet long, the capital semi-circular with a radius of\r\ntwenty-seven feet. To this a covered walk or portico is joined, as\r\nit were across the bottom of the page of the tablet, with passages\r\nleading on either side of the _ornithon_ proper which contains the\r\ncages, to the upper end of the interior quadrangle [_adjoining the\r\ncapital_]. This portico is constructed of a series of stone columns\r\nbetween which and the main outside walls are planted dwarf shrubs,\r\na net of hemp being stretched from the top of the walls to the\r\narchitrave of the portico, and thence down to the stylobate or floor.\r\nThe exterior spaces thus enclosed are filled with all kinds of birds\r\nwhich are fed through the net, water being provided by a small running\r\nstream. On the interior sides of the porticos, and adjoining them at\r\nthe upper end of the interior quadrangle, are constructed on both\r\nsides two narrow oblong basins. Between these basins a path leads\r\nto the _tholus_, or rotunda, which is surrounded with two rows of\r\ncolumns, like that in the house of Catulus, except that I have\r\nsubstituted columns for walls. Beyond these columns at the end is\r\na grove of large transplanted trees forming a roof of leaves, but\r\nadmitting light underneath, as that is entirely cut off by the high\r\nwalls on the sides. Between the exterior row of columns of the\r\n_tholus_, which are of stone, and the interior row, which are of pine,\r\nthere is a narrow space, five feet in width. The exterior columns are\r\nfilled in with a transparent net instead of walls, thus permitting the\r\nbirds to look out upon the grove and the wild birds there but without\r\nescaping: the interior columns being filled in with the net of the\r\nmain aviary. The space between the two rows of columns thus enclosed\r\nis equipped with perches for the birds in the form of many rods let\r\ninto all the columns in ascending array like the degrees of a theatre;\r\nand here are enclosed all kinds of birds, but chiefly singing birds,\r\nlike nightingales and blackbirds, for whom water is conducted by means\r\nof a small canal and food is supplied under the net. [_Under the\r\nlantern of the tholus is a basin of water: and around this_] a foot\r\nand nine inches below the stylobate or pedestal of the interior row\r\nof columns, runs a stone platform. This is five feet in width and two\r\nfeet above the level of the basin, thus affording a space on which\r\nmy bird guests may hop about from the cushions to the little columns\r\n[_which are there provided for them_].[171]\r\n\r\n\"The basin is immediately surrounded with a quay a foot in width\r\nadjoining [but below the level of] the platform and has a little\r\nisland in the middle. Around the platform and the quay are contrived\r\ndocks for ducks. On the island is a little column arranged to turn\r\non its axis and carrying a wheel-shaped table with hollow drum-like\r\ndishes fashioned at the ends of the spokes two and a half feet wide\r\nand a palm in depth. This is turned by a boy whose business that is,\r\nso that meat and drink is put before all my bird guests in turn. From\r\nthe elevation of the platform, where mats are usually placed, the\r\nducks go out to swim in the basin, and from this streams flow into\r\nthe two basins I have already described, and little fish may be seen\r\ndarting from one to the other, while warm or cold water may be turned\r\non the guests from the circumference of the revolving table, which I\r\nhave described as equipped with spokes.\r\n\r\n\"Within the dome is an arrangement to tell the hours by marking the\r\nposition in the heavens of the sun by day and Hesperus by night: and\r\nfurthermore, as in the clock which [Andronicus] Cyrrestes constructed\r\nat Athens, the eight winds are depicted on the dome, and, by means of\r\nan arrow connecting with a vane, the prevailing wind is indicated to\r\nthose within.\"[172]\r\n\r\nAs we were talking an uproar was heard on the Campus Martius. While\r\nthis did not astonish old parliamentary hands[173] like ourselves, who\r\nknew the enthusiasm of an election, yet we were anxious to know what\r\nit meant, and at this moment Pantuleius Parra came up and told us that\r\nwhile the votes were being sorted some one was caught stuffing the\r\nballot box[174] and had been haled before the consul by the supporters\r\nof the rival candidate. Pavo rose to go, for it was understood that\r\nhe who had been arrested was the campaign manager of Pavo's own\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of pea-cocks_\r\n\r\nVI. \"Now that Fircellius is gone you can speak freely of pea-cocks,\"\r\nsaid Axius, \"for if you should say any thing to their disadvantage in\r\nhis presence, you might perchance have a crow to pluck with him on\r\naccount of his relationship.\"[175]\r\n\r\n\"Within my memory,\" said Merula, \"the practice of keeping commercial\r\nflocks of pea-cocks has largely developed and it has so developed\r\nthat M. Aufidius Lurco is said to derive an income of sixty thousand\r\nsesterces per annum from them. If you keep them for profit it is well\r\nto have somewhat fewer males than females; while the contrary is true\r\nif you keep them for pleasure, for the pea-cock far surpasses his hen\r\nin beauty. With us they are fed in the country, but abroad it is said\r\nthat they are kept on islands, as at Samos in the grove of Juno and at\r\nPlanasia, the island of M. Piso. In setting up a flock age and beauty\r\nmust be considered, for nature has given the palm of beauty to the\r\npea-cock among all the birds. The hens are not fit for breeding under\r\ntwo years of age, nor when they are aged. They are fed all kinds of\r\ngrain but chiefly barley. Scius makes a practice of feeding them a\r\nmodius of barley apiece for the month before they begin to breed, his\r\npurpose being to make them more productive. He expects his overseer to\r\nraise three pea fowl for every hen, and he sells them when matured for\r\nfifty deniers ($10) a piece, a price such as one never obtains for a\r\nsheep.[176]\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, he buys eggs and sets them under dunghill hens,\r\ntransferring the young pea fowls so hatched to the shelter set apart\r\nfor their kind. This house should be built large enough for the number\r\nof pea fowl to be kept and should be equipped with separate roosting\r\nplaces smoothly stuccoed, so that snakes and such vermin may not be\r\nable to get into it: and, furthermore, it should have attached to it\r\na run in which the pea fowl may feed on sunny days, and both these\r\nplaces should be kept clean, as this kind of fowl demands. The keeper\r\nshould make the rounds often with a shovel to collect and preserve\r\ntheir manure, which is not only fit for use in agriculture but serves\r\nalso as bedding for your pea chicks.\r\n\r\n\"It is said that Q. Hortensius was the first to serve pea-cocks at\r\ndinner, on the occasion of his inauguration as an augur, an evidence\r\nof prodigality which was more approved by the luxurious than by good\r\nmen of simple manners: but many others quickly followed his example,\r\nso that the price of pea fowl was raised until an egg sold for five\r\ndeniers ($1) and a pea fowl itself readily for fifty ($10), thus a\r\nflock of an hundred of them easily yields an income of forty thousand\r\nsesterces, ($2,000), or even sixty ($3,000), if, as Abuccius advises,\r\none obtains three chickens from every pea hen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of pigeons_\r\n\r\nVII. In the meanwhile an apparitor came to Appius from the Consul and\r\nsaid that the augurs were summoned. As Appius went out from the _villa\r\npublica_, a flock of pigeons flew in, whereupon Merula said to Axius:\r\n\"If you had established a [Greek: peristerogropheion] you would think\r\nthat these were your pigeons, although they are wild, for it is the\r\ncustom to keep both kinds in a [Greek: peristerotropheion]. One is the\r\nwild dove (or, as some call them the rock dove, or _saxatilis_), such\r\nas live in the towers and dormers (_columines_) of a farm house,\r\nwhence they get the name _columbae_, because, on account of their\r\nnatural timidity, they seek the highest places on the roof. On this\r\naccount wild doves usually frequent towers, to which they may fly\r\nfrom the fields of their own accord, and return.[177] The other kind of\r\npigeons is tamer and are wont to seek their food at the very threshold\r\nof a house. This kind is usually white in colour, the wild variety\r\nbeing mottled but without any white. From these two stocks a third or\r\nmixed variety has been developed for commercial profit and these are\r\ncollected in the place which some call a _peristereon_ (pigeon house),\r\nand others a _peristerotropheion_ (place for raising pigeons), where\r\nthere are often confined as many as five thousand at a time.\r\n\r\n\"A pigeon house is made like a great dome, with arched roof, a narrow\r\nentrance, and grilled windows or with wider lattices on all sides so\r\nthat the interior may be well lighted and yet no snake or other such\r\npest may have access. The walls and the dome within and the edges of\r\nthe windows without should be smeared with light stucco to keep out\r\nrats and lizards, for nothing is so timid as a pigeon. A round nest\r\nshould be provided for each pair of pigeons and these should be\r\narranged in close order so that there may be established as many as\r\npossible of them ranked from the ground to the very dome. Each nest\r\nshould have a door no bigger than necessary to enable the pigeons to\r\ngo in and out but within should be of three palms in diameter. Under\r\neach rank of nests should be fastened planks two palms broad for the\r\nuse of the pigeons as a vestibule on coming out. Water should be led\r\ninto the pigeon house, both for them to drink and to bathe in, for\r\npigeons are very clean birds. For this reason the keeper of the\r\npigeons should sweep out the house several times a month, for that\r\nwhich soils it has so great a. value in agriculture that some writers\r\neven claim that it is the best of all manures. Furthermore, the keeper\r\nin these rounds may tend any pigeon which is ailing, remove any which\r\nare dead, and take out such squabs as are fit for market. Likewise,\r\nthose which are setting should be transferred to a particular place,\r\nseparated from the others by a net but from which the mothers may\r\nbe free to get out of doors: which is done for two reasons: first,\r\nbecause if they become weary or decrepit from being cooped too long,\r\nthey will be refreshed by the free air when they go abroad: secondly,\r\nbecause they serve as decoys for other pigeons, for their squabs will\r\nalways bring them home themselves unless they are struck down by a\r\ncrow or cut off by a hawk. Pigeon breeders rid themselves of the\r\nlast mentioned pests by planting in the ground two rods smeared with\r\nbirdlime and bent in one upon the other, and then tie on some bait\r\nso disposed that when the hawk falls upon his prey he finds himself\r\nentangled in the birdlime and is taken.\r\n\r\n\"It may be noted that the pigeon has a homing instinct, as is proved by\r\nthe practice of many in letting pigeons loose from their bosoms in the\r\ntheatre expecting them to return home, for if they did not return the\r\npractice would not persist.\r\n\r\n\"The food for pigeons is placed in mangers fastened around the walls\r\nand filled from the outside by means of conduits. They thrive on\r\nmillet, wheat, barley, peas, beans and vetch. This regimen should be\r\nfollowed also, as far as possible, in the care of the wild pigeons,\r\nwhich live on the towers and the roofs of the barn.\r\n\r\n\"In equipping a [Greek: peristereon] pigeons of good age should be\r\nsecured, neither squabs nor veterans, and as many males as females.\r\nNothing is more prolific than the pigeon, for in forty days they\r\nconceive, lay, hatch and raise a brood, and they keep this up nearly\r\nall the year, stopping only from the winter solstice until spring.\r\nSquabs are hatched in pairs, and as soon as they have grown up and\r\nhave strength breed with their own mothers. Those who fatten squabs in\r\norder to sell them dearer, make a practice of isolating them as soon\r\nas they are covered with feathers, then they cram them with white\r\nbread which has been chewed:[178] in winter this is fed twice a day, in\r\nsummer three times a day, morning, noon and night, the midday meal\r\nbeing omitted in winter. Those which are just beginning to have\r\nfeathers are left in the nests, but their legs are broken, and, in\r\norder that they may be crammed, the food is put before the mothers,\r\nfor they will feed themselves and their squabs on it all day long.\r\nSquabs which are reared in this way become fat more quickly than\r\nothers and have whiter flesh.\r\n\r\n\"A pair of pigeons will commonly sell at Rome for two hundred _nummi_,\r\nif they are well made, of good colour, without blemish, and of good\r\nbreed: some times they even bring a thousand _nummi_, and there is\r\na report that recently L. Axius, a Roman of the equestrian order,\r\ndeclined that sum, refusing to sell for less than four hundred\r\ndeniers.\"[179]\r\n\r\n\"If I could procure a fully equipped [Greek: peristereon],\" cried\r\nAxius, \"as readily as I have bought a supply of earthen ware nests, I\r\nwould have had it already on the way to my farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if,\" remarked Pica, \"there were not many of them here in town. But\r\nperhaps those who have pigeon houses on their roofs do not seem to you\r\nto be justified in calling them [Greek: peristereonas] even though\r\nsome of them represent an investment of more than one hundred thousand\r\nsesterces. I advise you to buy out one of them and learn how to pocket\r\na profit here in town, before you build on a large scale in the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of turtle doves_\r\n\r\nVIII. \"So much for that then,\" said Axius. \"Proceed, please, to the\r\nnext subject, Merula.\"\r\n\r\n\"For turtle doves,\" said Merula, \"in like manner a house should be\r\nconstructed proportioned to the number you intend to feed, and this,\r\nlike the pigeon house, I have described, should have a door and\r\nwindows and fresh water and walls and a vaulted roof, but in place of\r\nbreeding nests the mutules should be extended through the walls or\r\npoles set in them in regular order with hempen mats on them, the\r\nlowest rank being not more than three feet from the floor, the rest at\r\nintervals of nine inches, the top rank six inches from the vault, and\r\nof equal breadth as the mutule stands out from the wall. On these\r\nthe doves are fed day and night. For food they are given dry wheat,\r\nusually a half modius for every one hundred and twenty doves. Every\r\nday the house should be cleaned out, that they may not be injured by\r\nthe accumulation of manure, and because also it has its place in the\r\neconomy of the farm. The best time for fattening doves is about the\r\nharvest, for then the mothers are in their best condition and produce\r\nyoung ones not only in the largest number but the best for cramming:\r\nso that is the time when they are most profitable.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of poultry_\r\n\r\nIX. \"Tell me now, if you please, Merula,\" said Axius, \"what I should\r\nknow of raising and fattening poultry and wood pigeons, then we can\r\nproceed to the discussion of the remainder of our programme.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are three kinds of fowls usually classed as poultry,\" replied\r\nMerula, \"dunghill fowl, jungle fowl and guinea fowl. The dunghill fowl\r\nare those which are constantly kept in the country at farms.\r\n\r\n\"He who wishes to establish an [Greek: ornithoboskeion] from which, by\r\nthe exercise of intelligence and care, he can take large profits, as\r\nthe people of Delos do with such great success,[180] should observe five\r\nprincipal rules: 1° in regard to buying, what kind and how many he\r\nwill keep: 2° in regard to breeding: 3° in regard to eggs, how they\r\nare set and hatched: 4° in regard to chicks, how and by whom they are\r\nreared, and 5°, which is a supplement of all the foregoing, how they\r\nare fattened.\r\n\r\n\"The females of the dunghill fowl are called hens, the breeding males\r\ncocks, and the males which have been altered capons. Cocks are\r\ncaponized by burning the spurs[181] with a hot iron until the skin is\r\nbroken, the wound being poulticed with potters' clay.\r\n\r\n\"He who wishes to have a model [Greek: ornithoboskeion] should equip it\r\nwith all three kinds of fowls, though chiefly the dunghill variety. In\r\npurchasing these last it is important to choose fertile hens, which\r\nare indicated by red feathers, black wings, unequal toes, large heads,\r\ncombs upstanding and heavy, for such hens are more likely to lay.\r\n\r\n\"A lusty cock may be known by his muscular carriage, his red comb, a\r\nbeak short, strong and sharp, eyes tawny or black, wattles a whitish\r\nred, neck spotted or tinged with gold, the second joint of his legs\r\nwell covered with feathers, short legs long spurs, a heavy tail, and\r\nprofuse feathers, also by his spirit and his frequent crowing, his\r\nreadiness to fight, and that he is not only not afraid of such animals\r\nas do the hens harm, but even goes out to fight them. You must be\r\ncareful, however, not to buy for breeding any fowls of the breeds\r\nknown as Tanagran, Medean and Chalcidean, for, while they are\r\nbeautiful to look at and are fit for fighting with one another, they\r\nare practically sterile.\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to keep a flock of two hundred, choose an enclosed place\r\nand there construct two large poultry houses side by side and looking\r\nto the East, each about ten by five feet and a little less than five\r\nfeet in height, and furnished with windows three by four feet in which\r\nare fitted shutters of wickerwork, which will serve to let in plenty\r\nof fresh air and light and yet keep out such vermin as prey upon\r\nchickens.\r\n\r\n\"Between the two houses should be a door by which the _gallinarius_ who\r\ntakes care of them, may have access. Within the houses enough poles\r\nare arranged to serve as roosts for all the chickens: opposite each\r\nroost a nest should be set in the wall. In front of the house should\r\nbe an enclosed yard to which the fowls may have access in the day time\r\nand where they can dust themselves,[182] and there should be constructed\r\nthe keeper's house, which should be equipped all about with nests,\r\neither set into the walls or firmly fastened to them, for the least\r\ndisturbance injures eggs when they are setting.\r\n\r\n\"When the hens begin to lay, straw should be spread in their nests and\r\nthis should be renewed when they begin to set, for in such bedding\r\nare bred mites and other insects which will not suffer the hen to be\r\nquiet, with the result that the eggs are hatched unequally or rot.\r\n\r\n\"A hen should not be allowed to set on more than twenty-five eggs,\r\nalthough such is her fecundity that she lays more than that in a\r\nseason. The best time for hatching is from the spring to the autumn\r\nequinox. Eggs laid before or after this season, or the first eggs laid\r\nby a pullet, should never be set. Hens used for setting should be\r\nold rather than young, without sharp beaks and claws, for those so\r\nequipped are better employed in laying than in setting. Hens a year or\r\ntwo years old are better fitted for laying.\r\n\r\n\"If you set pea-cock eggs under a hen, you should wait ten days before\r\nadding hen eggs to the nest, to insure them all hatching together, for\r\nthe period of incubation of chicken eggs is thrice seven days and that\r\nof the eggs of pea-fowl is thrice nine. Sitting hens should be shut up\r\nday and night, except for a time in the morning and evening, when they\r\nare let out to eat and drink.\r\n\r\n\"The keeper should make the rounds every few days and turn the eggs,\r\nso that they may be kept warm all over. It is said that you can tell\r\nwhether an egg is fertile or sterile by putting it in water: for if it\r\nis sterile it will float, while if it is fertile it will sink. Those\r\nwho shake their eggs to ascertain this fact make a mistake for thereby\r\nthey destroy the germ in them. It is also said that you can tell a\r\nsterile egg by the fact that it is transparent when held against the\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"To preserve eggs they should be rubbed with fine salt or soaked for\r\nthree or four hours in brine, and then cleaned off or packed in chaff\r\nor straw. Care should be taken to set eggs only in uneven numbers. The\r\nkeeper can tell whether an egg is fertile or not four days after it is\r\nset, by holding it to the light, when he should throw it out if it is\r\nfound to be empty and substitute another for it.\r\n\r\n\"The new hatched chickens should be taken from every nest and given to\r\na hen who has only a few to care for. When in this way a setting hen\r\nhas less than half her eggs left unhatched, they should be taken from\r\nher and put under another hen which has eggs still unhatched. It is\r\nnot well to give more than thirty chicks to a hen. Chicks should\r\nbe fed for the first fifteen days in the dust to protect them from\r\ninjuring their tender beaks on the hard ground: their diet being\r\ncrushed barley mixed with cress seed and soaked in wine, for prepared\r\nin this way the grain is digestible. They should be kept away from\r\nwater in the beginning. When they begin to have feathers on their legs\r\nthe mites should be carefully picked off their heads and necks, for\r\nthese banes often destroy them. Deer's horn should be burnt around\r\ntheir coops to keep snakes away, for the very smell of those vermin is\r\nfatal to young chickens. They should be allowed to run in the sun and\r\nto scratch in a dung heap, which serves to develop them. This rule\r\napplies not only to young chickens but also to the entire [Greek:\r\nornithoboskeion], and should be practised all summer and even in\r\nwinter on mild and sunny days. A net should be stretched over the\r\nchicken yard to keep the fowls themselves from flying out and to\r\nprotect them from hawks and other birds of prey. Fowls should be\r\nprotected from heat as well as cold, for both are harmful to them.\r\nWhen the chicks have got their feathers it is best to accustom them to\r\nfollow one or two hens, leaving the other hens free to go to laying,\r\nin which occupation they are more useful than in rearing chicks.\r\n\r\n\"A hen should be set after the new moon, for those which begin earlier\r\nseldom hatch many chicks.\r\n\r\n\"They hatch usually in twenty days.\r\n\r\n\"And now since I have discussed the dunghill fowl at some length, I\r\nwill make up to you by brevity with respect to the other kinds of\r\nfowls.\r\n\r\n\"Jungle fowl are rarely seen at Rome, and then usually in cages. They\r\nresemble guinea chickens more than dunghill fowls. When perfect in\r\nform and appearance they are often carried in the public processions\r\nwith parrots and white blackbirds and other such rarities. They do not\r\nusually lay or raise their chickens on a farm, but in the forests. The\r\nisland of Gallinaria, which lies in the Tuscan sea off the coast of\r\nItaly, opposite the Ligurian mountains (and the towns of Intermelii\r\nand Alba Ingannua) derives its name from them, though some maintain\r\nthat the name comes from dunghill fowl which were carried to that\r\nisland by sailors and have there run wild. Guinea fowl (_gallinae\r\nafricanae_) are large, mottled and have their humps in their backs.\r\nThe Greeks call them [Greek: meleagrís].[183] They are the last fowls\r\nwhich the culinary art has introduced to our dining tables, on account\r\nof their gamy flavour.[184] By reason of their rarity they sell for a\r\nhigh price.\r\n\r\n\"Of the three kinds of fowls, the ordinary dunghill fowl is used\r\nchiefly for cramming. For this purpose they are shut up in a small\r\nconfined and darkened coop, because both exercise and light are\r\nenemies of fat. Any large chickens may be selected for this operation,\r\nnot necessarily of that breed which the peasants call Melica\r\nincorrectly, for as the ancients said Thelis when they meant Thetis,\r\nso the country people still say Melica for Medica. This name was given\r\nat first to the fowls which were imported from Medea on account of\r\ntheir great size and then to all of that breed, but now the name is\r\ngiven indiscriminately to all large fowls by reason of their general\r\nresemblance. After the feathers have been pulled from their tails and\r\nwings they are crammed with balls of barley paste, with which may be\r\nmixed darnel meal, or flax seed soaked in soft water. They are fed\r\ntwice a day but care must be taken to see that the last meal is\r\ndigested before another is put before them. After they have been fed\r\nand their heads have been cleaned of mites, they are shut up again.\r\nThis process is kept up for twenty-five days, when they will be fat.\r\n\r\n\"Some cram them on wheat bread soaked in water, or even in wine of\r\ngood flavour and bouquet, claiming that they are thereby made fat and\r\ntender in twenty days.[185]\r\n\r\n\"If in the process of cramming the fowls lose their appetite from too\r\nmuch food, the ration should be reduced daily during the last ten days\r\nin the same proportion as it was increased during the first ten days,\r\nso that the ration will be the same on the twentieth as on the first\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\"Wood pigeons are crammed and fattened in the same way.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of geese_\r\n\r\nX. \"Let us now pass,\" said Axius, \"to that tribe which cannot live in\r\nthe barn yard all the time, or even on land, but requires access to\r\nponds. I mean those whom you philhellenes call amphibia. I understand\r\nthat you call the places in which geese are kept by the Greek name\r\n[Greek: chaenoboskeion], and that Scipio Metellus and M. Seius have\r\nseveral large flocks of geese.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Seius' practice,\" said Merula, \"to maintain his flocks of\r\ngeese[186] in accordance with the five rules I have laid down for\r\npoultry, namely: with respect to choice of individuals, breeding,\r\neggs, goslings and the process of cramming.\r\n\r\n\"On the first point he requires the slave who buys his geese to select\r\nthem of good size and of white plumage, because they reproduce their\r\nown qualities in their goslings. This is necessary for there is\r\nanother kind of geese of variegated plumage, which are called wild,\r\nand do not flock freely with the other kind and are domesticated with\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\"The best time for breeding geese is at the end of winter and for\r\nlaying and hatching from the beginning of February or March until the\r\nsummer solstice. They breed usually in the water, diving to the bottom\r\nof the stream or pond.[187] A goose lays only three times a year: and\r\neach one should be furnished with a coop about two and a half feet\r\nsquare and bedded with straw: each of their eggs should be marked for\r\nidentification, for they will not hatch any eggs but their own. They\r\nare usually set on nine or eleven eggs, never more than fifteen, nor\r\nless than five. In cold weather they set for thirty days, in warm\r\nweather twenty-five. When they are hatched the goslings are suffered\r\nto remain with their mother for five days, and then daily, when the\r\nweather is fine, they are driven out to the meadows or to the ponds\r\nor some swampy place. The gosling houses may be built either above or\r\nbelow ground, but never more than twenty should be housed together and\r\ncare must be taken lest the floor be damp and that they are bedded on\r\nchaff or some thing of that kind, and that the house is so constructed\r\nas to keep out weasels and other beasts which prey on goslings. Geese\r\nare fed in wet places and it is the practice to sow especially for\r\ntheir food supply, using for this purpose any kind of grain, but\r\nparticularly that salad plant called endive[188] which keeps green\r\nwherever there is water, freshening at the mere contact of water\r\nhowever dry it may be. This is gathered to be fed to them, for if they\r\nhave access to the place where it is growing they will destroy the\r\nplant by trampling on it, or else kill themselves by eating too much\r\nof it, for they are greedy by nature. For this reason they must be\r\nwatched, as often in feeding their greediness leads them to seize a\r\nroot and to break their own necks in attempting to pull it from the\r\nground: for the neck is weak, as the head is soft.\r\n\r\n\"If there is none of this plant they should be fed barley or some other\r\ngrain. When the farrago season is on, feed that to them, but in the\r\nsame manner as I have described in respect of endive. While they are\r\nsetting they may be fed ground barley soaked in water. The goslings\r\nmay be fed for the first two days on barley cake (_pollenta_) or raw\r\nbarley, and for the next three days fresh water cress chopped fine in\r\na dish. When they are of an age to be kept by themselves in flocks of\r\ntwenty, in the kind of house I have described, they are fed on barley\r\nmeal or farrago or some kind of young herbage cut up.\r\n\r\n\"For cramming, goslings are picked out when they are about six months\r\nold, and are shut up in the fattening pen and there are fed three\r\ntimes a day as much as they will eat, of crushed barley and flour\r\ndust mixed with water, and after meals they should be made to drink\r\ncopiously. Kept on this diet they will be fat in about two months.[189]\r\nAfter every meal the feeding place must be cleaned, for, while geese\r\nlike a clean place, they never leave any place clean in which they\r\nhave been.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of ducks_\r\n\r\nXI. \"Whoever wishes to keep a flock of ducks and to establish a [Greek:\r\nnaessotropheion], should choose for it, above all others if it is\r\npossible, a swampy location because that is most agreeable to the\r\nducks, but, if not, then a situation sloping to a natural lake or\r\npool, or to an artificial pond, with steps leading down to it,\r\npracticable for the ducks. The enclosure where they are kept should\r\nhave a wall fifteen feet high, such as you saw at Seius' villa, with\r\nonly one door opening into it. All around the wall on the inside\r\nshould run a broad platform on which are built against the wall the\r\nduck houses, fronting on a level concrete vestibule in which is\r\nconstructed a permanent channel in which their food can be placed in\r\nwater, for ducks are fed in that way. The entire wall should be given\r\na smooth coating of stucco to keep out polecats[190] and other animals\r\nof prey, and the enclosure should be covered with a net of large mesh\r\nto prevent eagles from pouncing in and the ducks themselves from\r\nflying out.[191]\r\n\r\n\"For food they are given wheat, barley, grape marc, and some times even\r\nlobsters and other such aquatic animals. The pond in the enclosure\r\nshould be fed with a large head of water so that it may be kept always\r\nfresh.\r\n\r\n\"There are other kinds of similar birds, like teals and coots which may\r\nbe fed in the same way.\r\n\r\n\"Some even keep partridges, which, as Archelaus writes, conceive\r\nwhen they hear the voice of the male bird. By reason of the natural\r\nabundance and the delicacy of their flesh, these last are not crammed\r\nlike those domestic fowls I have described, but they are fattened by\r\nfeeding in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n\"And now, as I think that I have completed the first act of the drama\r\nof the barn yard, I am done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of rabbits_\r\n\r\nXII. At this point Appius returned and, after an exchange of questions\r\nand answers as to what had been said and done during his absence, he\r\nsaid: \"Here beginneth the second act of those industries which are\r\nwont to be practised at a villa, namely of those enclosures which are\r\nstill known as _leporaria_ from their ancient special designation.\r\nToday a warren no longer means an acre or two in which hares are kept,\r\nbut some times forests of vast extent in which troops of red deer\r\nand roe deer are enclosed. Q. Fulvius Lippinus is said to have forty\r\njugera enclosed in the neighbourhood of Tarquinii[192] where he keeps\r\nnot only those animals I have named but wild sheep as well. Parks\r\nof still larger extent are found in the territory of Statonia (in\r\nEtruria) and in certain other places: indeed, in transalpine Gaul T.\r\nPompeius has so great a game preserve that the enclosure is about four\r\nmiles in extent.[193]\r\n\r\n\"It is the practice to keep in such enclosures not only the animals\r\nI have named, but also snail houses and bee hives and jars in which\r\ndormice are fed, but the care and the increase and the feeding of all\r\nthese things are easy, except in the case of bees. Who does not know\r\nthat a _leporarium_ should be enclosed with masonry walls which are\r\nat once smooth and high the one to keep out wild cats and badgers and\r\nother such beasts: the other to prevent wolves from getting over.\r\nWithin should be coverts where the hares may lurk in the day time\r\nunder bushes and grass, and trees with broad spreading branches to\r\nward off the attacks of the eagle.\r\n\r\n\"Who does not know also that if he introduces only a few hares of both\r\nsexes in a short time the place will be full of them, for such is\r\nthe fecundity of this quadruped that two pair are enough to stock an\r\nentire warren in a short time. Often a mother who has just had her\r\nlitter is found to be big with another: indeed, Archelaus says that if\r\nyou want to know how old a hare is you have only to count the number\r\nof openings in her belly, for without doubt there is one for every\r\nyear of her life.\r\n\r\n\"It has recently become the practice to cram hares as well as poultry,\r\nand for this purpose they are taken out of the warren and shut up in\r\nsmall hutches where they are fattened. There are three kinds of hares:\r\nthe first, our common Italian kind, which has short front legs and\r\nlong hind legs, the upper part of the body dark coloured, the belly\r\nwhite, and long ears. Some say that our hare conceives a second time\r\nwhile it is still big. In transalpine Gaul and Macedonia they grow to\r\na great size, but in Spain and in Italy they are not so large. The\r\nsecond kind is native in Gaul near the Alps, and is white all over the\r\nbody: these are brought to Rome, but rarely. The third kind is native\r\nin Spain and is like our hare in every way except that it is smaller\r\nand is called rabbit (_cuniculus_).[194] L. Aelius thinks that the hare\r\n(_lepus_) gets his name from his swiftness, as it were that he is\r\nlight of foot (_levipes_), but I think the name is derived from the\r\nancient Greek, because the Aeolians of Boeotia call him [Greek:\r\nleporis]. The rabbits derive their latin name of _cuniculi_ from the\r\nhabit of making underground burrows to hide in [for _cuniculus_ is a\r\nSpanish word for mine]. If possible you should have all these three\r\nkinds in your warren. I am sure you already have the first two kinds,\"\r\nApius added, turning to me, \"and, as you were so many years in Spain\r\ndoubtless some rabbits followed you home.\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of game preserves_\r\n\r\nXIII. Then addressing himself again to Axius, Appius continued:\r\n\r\n\"You know, of course, that wild boars are kept in game parks, and that\r\nthose which are brought in wild are fattened with as little trouble as\r\nthe tame ones which are born in the park, for you have doubtless seen\r\nat the farm near Tusculum, which Varro here bought from M. Pupius\r\nPiso, wild boars and roe bucks assemble at the sound of the trumpet\r\nto be fed at regular hours, when from a platform, the keeper scatters\r\nmast to the wild boars and vetch or some such forage to the roe\r\nbucks.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw this done,\" put in Axius, \"more dramatically when I was a\r\nvisitor at the villa of Q. Hortensius in the country near Laurentum.\r\nHe has there a wood of more than fifty jugera in extent, all enclosed,\r\nbut it might better be called a [Greek: theriotropheion] than a\r\nwarren; there on high ground he caused his dinner table to be spread,\r\nand while we supped Hortensius gave orders that Orpheus be summoned:\r\nwhen he came, arrayed in his long robe, with a cithara in his hands,\r\nhe was desired to sing. At that moment a trumpet was sounded and at\r\nonce Orpheus was surrounded by a large audience of deer and wild boars\r\nand other quadrupeds: it seemed to be not less agreeable a spectacle\r\nthan the shows of game, without African beasts, which the Aediles\r\nprovide in the Circus Maximus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of snails_\r\n\r\nXIV. And turning to Merula, Axius continued: \"Appius has lightened\r\nyour task, my dear Merula, so far as concerns the matter of game, and\r\nbriefly the second act of our drama may be brought to an end, for I\r\ndo not seek to learn any thing about snails and dormice, which is all\r\nthat is left on the programme, for there can be no great trouble in\r\nkeeping them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not so simple as you seem to think, my dear Axius,\" replied\r\nMerula, \"for a place suitable for keeping snails[195] I must be not only\r\nin the open air but entirely surrounded by water, otherwise you will\r\nbe kept running not only after the children but also the parents which\r\nyou have supplied for breeding.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" said I, \"they must be enclosed by water to save the\r\nmaintenance of a slave catcher.\"\r\n\r\n\"A place which is not baked by the sun and on which the dew remains is\r\npreferable,\" continued Merula. \"If the place you use for your snails\r\nis not supplied with dew naturally, as often is the case in sunny\r\nsituations, and there is no available shady recess, such as is found\r\nunder rocks or hills whose feet are laved by a lake or a stream, then\r\nyou must supply dew artificially. This may be done by leading into the\r\nsnailery a pipe on the end of which is fixed a rose nozzle, through\r\nwhich water is forced against a rock so that it scatters in spray. The\r\nproblem of feeding snails is small, for they supply themselves without\r\nhelp, finding what they require as they creep over the level ground\r\nand also while clinging to the sides of a wall, if no running water\r\nprevents their access to it. On the hucksters' stands they keep alive\r\na long time, as it were chewing their own cud, all that is done for\r\nthem being to supply a few laurel leaves and scatter a little bran\r\nover them: so a cook never knows whether he is cooking them alive or\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"There are many kinds of snails, such as the small white ones, which\r\ncome from Reate: the large variety which are imported from Illyricum,\r\nand the medium size which come from Africa: but they vary in size in\r\ncertain localities of each of those countries. Thus, there is found in\r\nAfrica a variety which are called _solitannae_ of so great size that\r\ntheir shells will hold ten quarts:[196] and so in the other countries\r\nI have named they are found together of all sizes. They produce an\r\ninnumerable progeny, which at first are very small and soft but\r\ndevelop their hard shell with time. If you have large islands in the\r\nenclosure you may expect a rich haul from your snails.\r\n\r\n\"Snails are fattened by placing them in a jar smeared with boiled must\r\nand corn meal, on which they feed, and pierced with holes to admit the\r\nair, but they are naturally hardy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of dormice_\r\n\r\nXV. \"Dormice[197] are preserved on a different systern than snails, for\r\nwhile the one is confined by barriers of water, the other is kept in\r\nby a wall which must be coated on the inside with smooth stone or\r\nstucco to prevent their escape. Young nut trees should be planted in\r\nthe enclosure, and when these are not bearing, mast and chestnuts\r\nshould be thrown in to the dormice, for that is what makes them\r\nfat. Roomy cages should be provided for them in which to rear their\r\nyoung.[198] Little water is necessary, for dormice do not require much\r\nwater, but on the contrary affect dry places. They are fattened in\r\njars which are usually kept indoors. The potters make these jars in\r\ndifferent shapes, but with paths for the dormice to use contrived on\r\nthe sides and a hollow to hold their food, which consists of mast,\r\nwalnuts and chestnuts.[199] Covers are placed on the jars and there in\r\nthe dark the dormice are fattened.\"\r\n\r\n_Of bees_\r\n\r\nXVI. \"It remains now,\" said Appius, \"to rehearse the third and last\r\nact of our drama of the husbandry of the steading and to discuss the\r\nkeeping of fishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The third, indeed,\" exclaimed Axius, \"shall we deprive ourselves of\r\nhoney because in your youth you never drank mead in your own house,\r\nsuch was your practice of frugality?\"\r\n\r\n\"He speaks the truth,\" said Appius, to us, \"for I was indeed left a\r\npoor orphan with two brothers and two sisters to provide for, and it\r\nwas not until I had married one of them to Lucullus without portion\r\nand he had named me his heir that I began to drink mead in my own\r\nhouse and to supply it to my household: but there never was a day when\r\nI did not offer it to all my guests. But apart from that, it has been\r\nmy fortune, not yours,[200] Axius, to have known these winged creatures\r\nwhom nature has endowed so richly with industry and art, and that you\r\nmay appreciate that I know more than you do of their almost incredible\r\nnatural art, listen to what I am to say. It will then be for Merula\r\nto develop the practice of the bee keeper, or, as the Greeks call it,\r\n[Greek: melittourgia], as methodically as he has his other subjects.\r\n\r\n\"To begin then,[201] bees are generated partly by other bees and partly\r\nfrom the decaying carcase of an ox: so Archelaus in one of his\r\nepigrams calls them\r\n\r\n  'flitting offspring of decaying beef,'\r\n\r\nand else where he says,\r\n\r\n  'wasps spring from horses, bees from calves.'\r\n\r\n\"Bees are not of a solitary habit like eagles, but are of a social\r\nnature, like men, a characteristic they share with daws, but not for\r\nthe same reason, for bees live in colonies, the better to work and\r\nbuild, while daws congregate for gossip. Thus the life of a bee is one\r\nof intelligence and art, for man has learned from them to manufacture,\r\nto build, and to store his food: three occupations which are not the\r\nsame but are diverse in their nature, for it is one thing to provide\r\nfood, another to manufacture wax and honey, and still another to build\r\na house. Has not each cell in a honey comb six sides, or as many as a\r\nbee has feet, the art of which arrangement appears in the teaching of\r\nthe geometricians that of all polygons the hexagon covers the largest\r\narea within a circle.[202] Bees feed out of doors, but it is at home\r\nthat they manufacture that which is the sweetest of all things,\r\nacceptable to gods and men alike: for honey comb is offered on the\r\naltars and honey is served at the beginning of a dinner and again at\r\ndessert.\r\n\r\n\"Bees have institutions like our own, consisting of royalty, government\r\nand organized society. Cleanliness in all things is their aim: and so\r\nthey never alight in any place where there is filth or an evil odour,\r\nor even where there is a strong savour of such an unguent as we may\r\nconsider agreeable. For the same reason if one who approaches them is\r\ncovered with perfume,[203] they do not lick him as flies do, but they\r\nsting him, and by the same token no one ever sees bees crawling on\r\nmeat and blood and grease, as flies do. And so they only settle in\r\nplaces of sweet savour. They do a minimum of damage because in their\r\nharvesting they leave what they touch none the worse.[204] They are not\r\nso cowardly as not to resist who ever attempts to disturb them, and\r\nyet they are fully conscious of their own weakness. They are called\r\nthe Winged Servants of the Muses, because when they swarm they are\r\nquickly brought together by the music of cymbals and the clapping of\r\nhands: and as men assign Helicon and Olympus to be the haunts of the\r\nMuses, so nature has attributed the flowery and uncultivated mountains\r\nto the bees. They follow their king[205] wheresoever he goes, supporting\r\nhim when he is tired and even taking him upon their backs if he is\r\nunable to fly, so do they wish to serve him.[206] As they are not idlers\r\nthemselves, so do they hate those who are, and thus driving out the\r\ndrones, they exclude them from the hive, because they are of no\r\nservice but merely consume honey: and it happens that a few bees,\r\nbuzzing with wrath, will drive out a number of drones.\r\n\r\n\"They smear every thing about the entrance to the hive with a gum which\r\nis found between the cells which the Greeks call [Greek: erithakae].\r\nThey live under the discipline of an army, taking turns in resting and\r\nall doing their equal share of work, and they send out colonies and\r\ncarry out the orders of their leaders, given with the voice, but as it\r\nwere with a trumpet: and in like manner they have signs of peace and\r\nof war.\r\n\r\n\"But, Merula, now in my course I pass on the torch to you, as our\r\nAxius here is doubtless languishing while he has listened to all this\r\nnatural history, for I have said nothing of profit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" said Merula, \"whether what I can say on the subject\r\nof the profit to be derived from bees will satisfy you, Axius, but I\r\nhave as my authorities not only Seius, who takes five thousand pounds\r\nof honey every year from the hives he leases,[207] but also our friend\r\nVarro here, for I have heard him tell of two brothers Veiani, from the\r\nFalerian territory, whom he had under his command in Spain and who,\r\nalthough their father left them only a small house with a curtilage of\r\nnot exceeding a jugerum in extent, nevertheless made themselves rich.\r\nThey set bee hives all about the house and planted part of the land\r\nin a garden and filled up the rest with thyme and clover and that\r\nbee plant known to us as _apiastrum_, though some call it [Greek:\r\nmeliphullon], others [Greek: mellissophullon] and still others\r\n_melittaena_: and by this means they were wont to derive, as they\r\nestimated, an average income of not less than ten thousand sesterces\r\nper annum from honey; but they did this by being willing to wait until\r\nthey could sell at their own time and price rather than by forcing the\r\nmarket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" exclaimed Axius, \"where and how I should establish a\r\nbee-stand to make such a handsome profit.\"\r\n\r\n\"The apiary,\" replied Merula, \"which some call by the Greek names\r\n[Greek: melitton] and [Greek: melittotropheion], and others\r\n_mellarium_, should preferably be placed near the house[208] in a\r\nlocation where there is no echo (for such sounds are deemed to put\r\nthem to flight, as timid men are by the din of a battle) and where the\r\ntemperature is mild, exposed neither to the heat of summer nor the\r\ncold of winter, giving preferably to the Southeast and near of access\r\nto places where their food is abundant and there is a supply of fresh\r\nwater. If there is no natural supply of food available you should\r\nplant such things as best serve bees for pasture, namely: roses,\r\nthyme, bee balm,[209] poppies, beans, lentils, peas, basil, gladiolus,\r\nalfalfa, and especially clover which is of great service to the bees\r\nwhich are sick, for it begins to bloom at the vernal equinox and lasts\r\nuntil that of autumn. As clover is the best food for sick bees, so\r\nthyme is the best for making honey, and it is because Sicily abounds\r\nin good thyme that it takes the palm for producing honey. On this\r\naccount some men bruise thyme in a mortar and mix warm water with it\r\nand then spray all their nursery plants with it for the sake of the\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n\"The hives should be set as near the house as convenient: some men even\r\nput them under the very portico for greater safety. Hives are made in\r\nvarious shapes and sizes and of different material;[210] thus some make\r\nthem round out of wicker work: others of frame covered with bark:\r\nothers use hollow tree trunks: others vessels of pottery: some even\r\nbuild them square out of rods, allowing about three feet in length and\r\na foot in height, but these dimensions should be reduced where you\r\nhave not enough bees to fill a hive of that size, for fear that the\r\nbees might become discouraged by too large an empty space.\r\n\r\n\"The bee hive derives its name _alvus_, which is the same as our word\r\nfor belly, from the fact that it holds food, that is to say, honey;\r\nand it is on this analogy that hives are usually shaped to imitate the\r\nform of the belly, small in the waist and bulging out below. When the\r\nhives are made of wicker work they should be coated evenly within and\r\nwithout with ox dung[211] so that the bees may not be driven away by\r\nthe roughness of their roof. The hives should be so ordered under the\r\nshelter of a wall that they may not be disturbed nor touch one another\r\nwhen arranged in ranks, for it is the practice to place hives in two\r\nand some times three separated ranks, but the opinion is that it is\r\nbetter to reduce the ranks to two than to increase them to four. In\r\nthe middle of the hive small openings are made on the right and the\r\nleft to serve as entrances for the bees, and on top is placed a\r\npracticable cover, which may be removed to give access to the honey\r\ncomb. This is best when made of bark, and worst of pottery, because\r\nthat is strongly affected both by the cold of winter and the heat of\r\nsummer. In spring and summer the bee keeper should inspect each hive\r\nat least three times a month, fumigating them lightly, cleaning\r\nand throwing out dirt and worms. At the same time he should take\r\nprecautions to keep down the number of princes, for they keep the bees\r\nfrom work by stirring up sedition. There are said to be three kinds of\r\nroyalties among the bees: the black, the red and the mottled, or, as\r\nMenecrates writes, two: the black and the mottled: and as the latter\r\nis the better it behooves the bee keeper, when he finds both kinds in\r\na hive, to kill the black one, as he is forever playing politics[212]\r\nagainst the other king, whereby the hive must suffer, for inevitably\r\none of the kings will flee or be driven out, in either case taking his\r\nparty with him.\r\n\r\n\"Of working bees the small round mottled variety is considered the\r\nbest. The drone, or, as some call him, the thief,[213] is black with a\r\nlarge belly. The wasp, which has some resemblance to a bee, is not,\r\nhowever, a fellow labourer, but attacks the bees with his sting,\r\nwherefore the bees keep him at a distance.\r\n\r\n\"Bees are themselves distinguished as wild and tame. I call those wild\r\nwhich feed in the forests, and those tame which feed in cultivated\r\nplaces. The forest bees are smaller in size and hairy but better\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\n\"In buying bees it behooves the purchaser to see whether they are\r\nwell or ailing. The signs of health are a thick swarm, well groomed\r\nappearance and a hive being filled in a workmanlike manner. The signs\r\nof lack of condition on the other hand are a hairy and bristling\r\nappearance and a dusty coat, unless this last is caused by a pressure\r\nof work, for under such circumstances they often wear themselves down\r\nand become thin.\r\n\r\n\"If the hives are to be transferred from one place to another it is\r\nnecessary to choose a fit time to make the move and a suitable place\r\nto receive them. As to time, spring is preferable to winter because in\r\nwinter they have difficulty in adjusting themselves to a new location\r\nand so often run away, as they do also if you move them from a good\r\nlocation to a place where proper pasture is not available. Nor is a\r\ntransfer from one hive to another in the same place to be undertaken\r\ncarelessly, but that to which the bees are to be transferred should be\r\nrubbed with bee balm, which will serve as a bait for them, and\r\nsome pieces of honey comb should be placed in it, not far from the\r\nentrances, for fear that the bees might run away if they found the\r\nlarder of their new home empty.\r\n\r\n\"Menecrates says that bees contract a malady of the bowels from their\r\nfirst spring pasture on the blossoms of the almond and the cornel\r\ncherry and are cured by giving them urine to drink.[214]\r\n\r\n\"That gummy substance which the bees use, chiefly in summer to\r\nconstruct a sort of curtain between the entrance and the hive, is\r\ncalled _propolis_, and by the same name is used by physicians in\r\nmaking plasters: by reason of which use it sells in the Via Sacra for\r\nmore than honey itself. That substance which is called _erithacen_,\r\nand is used to glue the cells together, is different from both honey\r\nand _propolis_: it is supposed to have a quality of attraction for\r\nbees and is accordingly mixed with bee balm and smeared on the branch\r\nor other place on which it is desired to have a swarm light. The comb\r\nis made of wax and is multicellular, each cell in it having six sides\r\nor as many as nature has given the bee feet. It is said that bees do\r\nnot gather from the same plants all the materials which enter in these\r\nfour substances which they manufacture, namely: propolis, erithacen,\r\nwax and honey. Thus from the pomegranate and the asparagus they gather\r\nfood alone, wax from the olive tree, honey from the fig, but not of\r\ngood quality: other plants like the bean, the bee balm, the gourd and\r\nthe cabbage serve a double purpose and yield both wax and food: while\r\nthe apple and the wild pear serve a similar double purpose but for\r\nfood and honey and the poppy again for wax and honey.\r\n\r\n\"Others again provide material for three purposes, food, honey and\r\nwax, such as the almond and the charlock.[215] In like manner there\r\nare flowers from each of which they derive a different one of these\r\nsubstances, and others from which they derive several of them: while\r\nthey make distinctions in respect of plants according to the quality\r\nof the product they yield,--or rather the plants make the distinction\r\nfor them--as with respect to honey, some yield liquid honey, like the\r\nskirwort,[216] and others thick honey like the rosemary. So again honey\r\nof insipid flavour is made from the fig, good honey from clover, and\r\nthe best of all from thyme.\r\n\r\n\"And since drink is part of a bee's diet and water is the liquid they\r\nuse, there should be provided near the stand a place for them to\r\ndrink, which may be either a running stream or a reservoir not more\r\nthan two or three fingers deep in which bricks or stones are placed\r\nin such a way as to project a little from the water, and so furnish\r\na place for the bees to sit and drink; but the greatest care must be\r\ntaken to keep this water fresh, as it is of high importance to the\r\nmaking of good honey.\r\n\r\n\"As the bees cannot go out to distant pasture in all weathers, food\r\nmust be prepared for them, as otherwise they will live on their supply\r\nof honey and so deplete the store in the hive. For this purpose ten\r\npounds of ripe figs may be boiled in six congii of water and bits\r\nof the paste thus prepared should be set out near the hives. Others\r\nprovide honey water in little dishes and float flocks of clean wool on\r\nthem through which the bees may suck without risk of either getting\r\nmore than is good for them or of being drowned. One such dish should\r\nbe provided for each hive and they should be kept filled. Others again\r\nbray dried grapes and figs together and, mixing in some boiled must,\r\nmake a paste of which bits are exposed near the hives during such part\r\nof the winter as the bees are still able to go forth in search of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n\"When a swarm is about to come out of the hive (which happens when a\r\nnumber of young bees have matured, and the hive determines to send\r\ntheir youth out to found a colony, as formerly the Sabines often were\r\ncompelled to do on account of the number of their children)[217] there\r\nare two signs by which the intention may be known: one that for\r\nseveral days before hand, and especially in the evening, many bees\r\nweave themselves together and hang upon the entrance of the hive like\r\ngrapes: the other that when they are about to go forth or have already\r\nbegun to go they buzz together lustily, as soldiers do when they break\r\ncamp. Those who have come forth first fly about the hive waiting for\r\nthe others, who have not yet collected, to join them. When the bee\r\nkeeper notices this he has only to throw dust on them and at the\r\nsame time beat upon some copper vessel to collect them, thoroughly\r\nfrightened, where he desires in some nearby place on which he has\r\nsmeared erithacen and bees' balm and other things in which they\r\ndelight. When they have settled down he should place near them a hive\r\nsmeared within with the same baits, and then, by blowing a light smoke\r\naround them, compel them to enter the hive. When thus introduced into\r\ntheir new abode the swarm makes itself at home cheerfully, so that\r\neven if placed next to the parent hive they will prefer their new\r\ncolonial settlement.\r\n\r\n\"And now, having told you all I know about the care of bees, I will\r\nspeak of that for which the industry is carried on, that is to say, of\r\nthe profit.\r\n\r\n\"The honey is taken off when the hive is full, as may be determined by\r\nremoving the cover of the hive, for if the openings of the combs are\r\nseen to be sealed, as it were with a skin, then the hive is full\r\nof honey: but the bees themselves give notice of this condition by\r\nkeeping up a loud buzzing within, by their agitation when they go in\r\nand out and by driving out the drones.\r\n\r\n\"In taking off honey some say that you should be content with nine\r\nparts, leaving the tenth, because if you take it all the bees will\r\ndesert the hive: others leave a still larger proportion than I have\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\"As those who crop their corn land every year obtain good yields only\r\nat intervals, so it is with bee hives: you will have more industrious\r\nand more profitable bees if you do not exact of them the same tribute\r\nevery year.\r\n\r\n\"It is considered that honey should be taken off for the first time at\r\nthe rising of the Pleiades, for the second time at the end of summer\r\nbefore Arcturus has reached the zenith, and for the third time after\r\nthe setting of the Pleiades, but this last time beware not to take\r\nmore than one-third of the store even if the hive is full, leaving\r\nthe other two-thirds for the winter supply, but if the hive is only\r\npartially filled nothing should be taken off. In any event, when a\r\nlarge amount of honey is to be taken off a hive it should not be done\r\nall at once or ostentatiously less the bees be discouraged. Those\r\ncombs which, on being taken off, are found to be partly unfilled with\r\nhoney or to be soiled, should be pared with a knife.\r\n\r\n\"Care must be taken that the weaker bees in a hive are not oppressed by\r\nthe stronger, for this diminishes the profit: to this end the minority\r\nparty[218] may be colonized under another king. When bees are given to\r\nfighting with one another, you should sprinkle them with honey water,\r\nupon which they will not only cease fighting but will crowd together\r\nand kiss one another: and this will prove the case even more if they\r\nare sprinkled with mead, for the savour of the wine in it will cause\r\nthem to apply themselves so greedily that they will fuddle themselves\r\nin sucking it. If the bees seem lazy about coming out to work and any\r\npart of them get the habit of remaining in the hive, they should be\r\nfumigated and odoriferous herbs, like bees' balm and thyme, should be\r\nplaced near the hive. Watchful care is necessary to protect them from\r\nruin by heat or cold. If the bees are overtaken by a sudden rain or\r\ncold while at pasture (which rarely happens for they usually foresee\r\nsuch things) and are stricken down by the heavy rain drops and laid\r\nlow and stunned, you should gather them in a dish and place them under\r\ncover in a warm place until the weather has cleared, when they should\r\nbe sprinkled with ashes of fig wood (making sure that the ashes are\r\nrather hot than warm) the dish should then be shaken gently without\r\ntouching the bees with your hand, and placed in the sun. When the bees\r\nfeel this warmth they revive and get on their feet again, just as\r\nflies do after they have been apparently drowned. This should be done\r\nnear the hive so that when the bees have come to themselves they may\r\nreturn home and to work.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of fish ponds_\r\n\r\nXVII. Here Pavo returned and said: \"You may weigh anchor now if you\r\nwish. The drawing of the lots of the tribes to determine a tie vote is\r\nover and the herald is announcing the result of the election.\"\r\n\r\nAppius arose without delay and went to congratulate his candidate, and\r\nescort him home.\r\n\r\nMerula said: \"I will leave the third act of our drama of the husbandry\r\nof the steading to you, Axius,\" and went out with the others, leaving\r\nAxius with me to wait for our candidate whom we knew would come to\r\njoin us. Axius said to me: \"I do not regret Merula's departure at this\r\npoint, for I am quite well up on the subject of fish ponds, which\r\nstill remains to complete our programme.\r\n\r\n\"There are two kinds of fish ponds, of fresh water and salt water. The\r\nformer are commonly maintained by farmers and without much expense,\r\nfor the Lymphae, the homely goddesses of the Fountains, supply the\r\nwater for them, while the latter, the sea ponds, are the play things\r\nof our nobles and are furnished with both water and fishes, as it were\r\nby Neptune himself: serving more the purposes of pleasure than of\r\nutility, their accomplishment being rather to empty than to fill the\r\nexchequers of their lords. For in the first place they are built at\r\ngreat expense, then they are stocked at great expense, and finally\r\nthey are maintained at great expense.\r\n\r\n\"Hirrus was wont to derive an income of twelve thousand sesterces from\r\nthe buildings surrounding his fish ponds, all of which he spent\r\nfor food for his fishes: and no wonder, for I remember that on one\r\noccasion he lent two thousand _murenae_ to Caesar[219] by weight\r\n(stipulating for their return in kind), so that his villa (which\r\nwas not otherwise extraordinary) sold for four million sesterces on\r\naccount of the stock of fish.\r\n\r\n\"In sooth, the inland ponds of our farmer folk may well be called\r\n_dulcis_, and those other _amara_.[220]\r\n\r\n\"A single fish pond suffices us simple folk, but those amateurs must\r\nhave a series of them linked together: for as Pausias and other\r\npainters of his school have boxes with as many compartments as they\r\nhave different coloured wax, so must they fain have as many ponds as\r\nthey have different varieties of fish.\r\n\r\n\"These fish are furthermore sacred, more sacred, indeed, than those\r\nfish which you, Varro, say you saw in Lydia, (at the same time that\r\nyou saw the dancing isles)[221] which came to the shore, where the altar\r\nwas erected for a sacrifice, in shoals at the sound of the Greek pipe,\r\nbecause no one ever ventured to molest them; so no cook has ever been\r\nknown to have 'sauced' one of these fishes.[222]\r\n\r\n\"When our friend Hortensius had those fish ponds at Baulii, which\r\nrepresented so large an investment, he was wont to send to Puteoli to\r\nbuy the fish he served on his table, as I have often seen when I was\r\nvisiting him. And it was not enough that his fishes did not supply\r\nhis table, but he was at pains to supply theirs, taking greater\r\nprecautions lest his mullets (_mulli_) should go hungry than I do for\r\nmy mules in Rosea, and it was not at less cost that he supplied meat\r\nand drink to his stock than I do to mine. For I raise my asses, which\r\nbring such fancy prices, at the cost of one servant, a little barley\r\nand the water which springs from my land, while Hortensius must needs\r\nmaintain a fleet of fishermen to keep him supplied with small fry to\r\nfeed to his fish, or, when the sea runs high and such deep sea forage\r\nis cut off by a storm, and it is not possible even to draw live bait\r\nashore in a net, he is fain to buy in the market for the delectation\r\nof the denizens of his ponds the very salt fish which is the food of\r\nthe people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless,\" said I, \"Hortensius would prefer to have you take the\r\ncarriage mules out of his stable than one of his barbel mules from the\r\nfish pond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" agreed Axius, \"and he would rather have a sick slave\r\ndrink cold water than that his beloved fish should be risked in that\r\nwhich is fresh. On the other hand, M. Lucullus was reputed to be so\r\ncareless and neglectful of his fish ponds that he did not provide any\r\nsuitable quarters for his fishes in hot weather, but permitted them to\r\nremain in ponds which were unhealthy with stagnant water: a practice\r\nvery different from that of his brother L. Lucullus, who yielded\r\nnothing to Neptune himself in his care of his fishes, for he pierced\r\na mountain at Naples, and so contrived that the sea water in his fish\r\nponds should be renewed by the action of the tides. Furthermore, he\r\nhas arranged that his beloved fishes may be driven into a cool place\r\nduring the heat of the day, just as the Apulian shepherds do when they\r\ndrive their flocks along the drift ways to the Sabine mountains: for\r\nso great was his ardour for the welfare of his fishes that he gave a\r\ncommission to his architect to drive at his sole cost a tunnel from\r\nhis fish ponds at Raise to the sea, and by throwing out a mole\r\ncontrived that the tide should flow in and out of his fish ponds twice\r\na day, from moon to moon, and so cool them off.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, while we were talking, there was a sound of foot steps\r\non the right and our candidate came into the _villa publica_ arrayed\r\nin the broad purple of his new rank as an aedile. We went to meet him\r\nand, after congratulations, escorted him to the Capitol, whence he\r\ndeparted for his home and we to ours.\r\n\r\nSo there, my dear Pinnius, is the brief record of our discourse on the\r\nhusbandry of the steading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The manner in which the ancients managed their fallow\r\nis certainly most worthy of our attention: their care in ploughing,\r\naccording to the situation of the land, and nature of the climate, and\r\ntheir manner of adapting the kind of ploughing to answer the purposes\r\nintended by the operation, are also most worthy of our imitation.\r\nTheir exactness in these things exceeds any thing of the kind found\r\namongst the moderns, and is even beyond what any practical writer on\r\nagriculture has proposed. This is an evidence that tillage is not even\r\nin this age brought to that perfection of which it is capable: and\r\nthat, notwithstanding all the improvements lately introduced, we may\r\nyet receive some instruction from a proper attention to the precepts\r\nand practices of the ancients. I am desirous to add that this\r\nattention may be useful by preventing improvers from running into\r\nevery specious scheme of agriculture produced by a lively imagination\r\nand engaging them to study the great variety of soils and even\r\nclimates in this island, and to be careful in adapting to these their\r\nseveral operations.\" Dickson _Husbandry of the Ancients_, XXIII.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Andrew Dickson, who died in 1776, was minister of Aberlady in\r\nthe county of East Lothian, the son of a progressive and successful\r\nScots farmer, and had experience in practical agriculture, as well as\r\nin scholarship, as his book shows.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The compilation of rural lore, known as the _Geoponica_,\r\nwhich exists in Greek, was made at Byzantium for the Emperor\r\nConstantine VII about the middle of the tenth century A.D.

We\r\nmay all desire that historical and philological science should push\r\nher dominion into every recess of human action and human speech, but\r\nwe must utter some protest when the very heights of Parnassus are\r\ninvaded by a spirit which surely is not science, but her unmeaning\r\nshadow; a spirit which would degrade every masterpiece of human genius\r\ninto the mere pabulum of hungry professors, and which values a poet's\r\ntext only as a field for the rivalries of sterile pedantry and\r\narbitrary conjecture.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: It was perhaps this encomium upon the farmer at the\r\nexpense of the banker which inspired Horace's friend Alfius to\r\nwithdraw his capital from his banking business and dream a delicious\r\nidyl of a simple carefree country life: but, it will be recalled\r\n(Epode II, the famous \"Beatus ille qui procul negotiis\") that Alfius,\r\nlike many a modern amateur farmer, recruited from town, soon repented\r\nthat he had ever listened to the alluring call of \"back to the land\"\r\nand after a few weeks of disillusion in the country, returned to town\r\nand sought to get his money out again at usury.\r\n\r\nColumella (I, praef.) is not content with Cato's contrast of the\r\nvirtue of the farmer with the iniquity of the banker, but he brings\r\nin the lawyer's profession for animadversion also. This, he says, the\r\nancient Romans used to term a canine profession, because it consisted\r\nin barking at the rich.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The Roman numerals at the beginning of the paragraphs\r\nindicate the chapters of Cato from which they are translated. If\r\nCato had not pretended to despise every thing which smacked of Greek\r\nliterary art he might have edited and arranged his material, in which\r\nevent his book would have been easier to read than it is, and no less\r\nvaluable. Modern scholarship would not now venture to perform such an\r\noffice for such a result, because it involves tampering with a text\r\n(as who should say, shooting a fox!) and yet modern scholarship\r\nwonders at the decay of classical studies in an impatient age. At the\r\nrisk of anathema the present version has attempted to group Cato's\r\nmaterial, and in so doing has omitted most of those portions which are\r\nnow of merely curious interest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This, of course, means buying at a high price, except\r\nin extraordinary cases. There is another system of agriculture which\r\nadmits of the pride of making two blades of grass grow where none was\r\nbefore, and the profit which comes of buying cheap and selling dear.\r\nThis is farming for improvement, an art which was well described two\r\nhundred years before Cato. Xenophon (_Economicus_ XX, 22) says:\r\n\r\n\"For those who are able to attend to their affairs, however, and\r\nwho will apply themselves to agriculture earnestly, my lather both\r\npractised himself and taught me a most successful method of making\r\nprofit; for he would never allow me to buy ground already cultivated,\r\nbut exhorted me to purchase such as from want of care or want of means\r\nin those who had possessed it, was left untilled and unplanted. He\r\nused to say that well cultivated land cost a great sum of money and\r\nadmitted of no improvement, and he considered that land which is\r\nunsusceptible of improvement did not give the same pleasure to the\r\nowner as other land, but he thought that whatever a person had or\r\nbought up that was continually growing better afforded him the highest\r\ngratification.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Every rural community in the Eastern part of the United\r\nStates has grown familiar with the contrast between the intelligent\r\namateur, who, while endeavoring earnestly to set an example of good\r\nagriculture, fails to make expenses out of his land, and the born\r\nfarmer who is self-supporting in the practice of methods contemned\r\nby the agricultural colleges. Too often the conclusion is drawn that\r\nscientific agriculture will not pay; but Cato puts his finger on the\r\ntrue reason. The man who does not depend on his land for his living\r\ntoo often permits his farm to get what Cato calls the \"spending\r\nhabit.\" Pliny (_H.N._ XVIII, 7) makes some pertinent observations on\r\nthe subject:\r\n\r\n\"I may possibly appear guilty of some degree of rashness in making\r\nmention of a maxim of the ancients which will very probably be looked\r\nupon as quite incredible, 'that nothing is so disadvantageous as to\r\ncultivate land in the highest style of perfection.'\"\r\n\r\nAnd he illustrates by the example of a Roman gentleman, who, like\r\nArthur Young in eighteenth century England, wasted a large fortune in\r\nan attempt to bring his lands to perfect cultivation. \"To cultivate\r\nland well is absolutely necessary,\" Pliny continues, \"but to cultivate\r\nit in the very highest style is mere extravagance, unless, indeed, the\r\nwork is done by the hands of a man's own family, his tenants, or those\r\nwhom he is obliged to keep at any rate.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: In this practice has been the delight of men of affairs\r\nof all ages who turn to agriculture for relaxation. Horace cites it\r\nwith telling effect in the ode (III, 5) in which he describes the\r\nnoble serenity of mind with which Regulus returned to the torture\r\nand certain death which awaited him at Carthage: and Homer makes an\r\nenduring picture of it in the person of the King supervising his\r\nfall ploughing, which Hephsestus wrought upon the shield of Achilles\r\n(_Iliad_, XVIII, 540). \"Furthermore, he set in the shield a soft fresh\r\nploughed field, rich tilth and wide, the third time ploughed, and many\r\nploughers therein drove their yokes to and fro as they wheeled about.\r\nWhensoever they came to the boundary of the field and turned, then\r\nwould a man come to each and give into his hands a goblet of sweet\r\nwine: while others would be turning back along the furrows, fain to\r\nreach the boundary of the deep tilth, ... and among them the King was\r\nstanding in silence, with his staff, rejoicing in his heart.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This advice to sell the worn out oxen and the sick slaves\r\njustly excited Plutarch's generous scorn, and has been made the text\r\nof a sweeping denunciation by Mommsen of the practice of husbandry by\r\nmen of affairs in Cato's time. \"The whole system,\" says Mommsen, \"was\r\npervaded by the utterly unscrupulous spirit characteristic of\r\nthe power of capital.\" And he adds, \"If we have risen to that\r\nlittle-to-be-envied elevation of thought which values no feature of\r\nan economy save the capital invested in it, we cannot deny to the\r\nmanagement of the Roman estates the praise of consistency, energy,\r\npunctuality, frugality and solidity.\" Without any desire to defend\r\nCato, one may suggest, out of an experience in a kind of farm\r\nmanagement not very different from that Cato pictures, that it is\r\ndoubtful whether even Cato himself was quite as economical and\r\nefficient, and so as capitalistic in his farming, as he advises others\r\nto be: certainly a whole race of contemporary country gentlemen was\r\nnot equal to it. It is much easier to write about business-like\r\nfarming than to practise it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Hesiod (W. & D. 338) had already given this same advice\r\nto the Greek farmer:\r\n\r\n\"Invite the man that loves thee to a feast, but let alone thine enemy,\r\nand especially invite him that dwelleth near thee, for if, mark you,\r\nany thing untoward shall have happened at home neighbours are wont to\r\ncome ungirt, but kinsfolk gird themselves first.\" This agreement of\r\nthe Socialist Hesiod with the Capitalist Cato is remarkable only as\r\nit illustrates that both systems when wisely expounded rest on human\r\nnature. That upon which they here agree is the foundation of the\r\nmodern European societies for rural co-operative credit which\r\nPresident Taft recommended to the American people. These societies,\r\nsays the bulletin of the International Institute of Agriculture\r\npublished at Rome in 1912, rest on three chief safeguards:\r\n\r\n(a) That membership is confined to persons residing within a small\r\ndistrict, and, therefore, the members are personally known to one\r\nanother;\r\n\r\n(b) That the members, being mutually responsible, it will be to the\r\ninterest of all members to keep an eye upon a borrower and to see that\r\nhe makes proper use of the money lent to him;\r\n\r\n(c) That in like manner, it is to the interest of all members to help\r\na member when he is in difficulties.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: This was an estate of average size, probably within\r\nVirgil's precept, (_Georgic_ II, 412). \"Laudato ingentia rura, exiguum\r\ncolito.\" Some scholars have deemed this phrase a quotation from Cato,\r\nbut it is more likely derived from Mago the Carthaginian who is\r\nreported to have said: \"Imbecilliorem agrum quam agricolam, esse\r\ndebere,\"--the farmer should be bigger than his farm.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: The philosophy of Cato's plan, of laying out a farm is\r\nfound in the agricultural history of the Romans down to the time of\r\nthe Punic wars. Mommsen (II, 370) gives the facts, and Ferrero in his\r\nfirst volume makes brilliant use of them. There is sketched the old\r\npeasant aristocrat living on his few acres, his decay and the\r\ncreation of comparatively large estates worked by slaves in charge of\r\noverseers, which followed the conquest of the Italian states about\r\nB.C. 300. This was the civilization in which Cato had been reared,\r\nbut in his time another important change was taking place. The Roman\r\nfrontier was again widened by the conquest of the Mediterranean basin:\r\nthe acquisition of Sicily and Sardinia ended breadstuff farming as the\r\nstaple on the Italian peninsular. The competition of the broad and\r\nfertile acres of those great Islands had the effect in Italy which the\r\ncultivation of the Dakota wheat lands had upon the grain farming of\r\nNew York and Virginia. About 150 B.C. the vine and the olive became\r\nthe staples of Italy and corn was superseded. Although this was not\r\naccomplished until after Cato's death, he foresaw it, and recommended\r\nthat a farm be laid out accordingly, and his scheme of putting one's\r\nreliance upon the vine and the olive was doubtless very advanced\r\ndoctrine, when it first found expression.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Pliny quotes Cato as advising to buy what others have\r\nbuilt rather than build oneself, and thus, as he says, enjoy the\r\nfruits of another's folly. The _cacoethes aedificandi_ is a familiar\r\ndisease among country gentlemen.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Columella (I,4) makes the acute observation that the\r\ncountry house should also be agreeable to the owner's wife if he\r\nwishes to get the full measure of enjoyment out of it. Mago, the\r\nCarthaginian, advised to, \"if you buy a farm, sell your house in town,\r\nlest you be tempted to prefer the cultivation of the urban gods to\r\nthose of the country.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: According to German scholarship the accepted text of\r\nCato's version of this immemorial epigram is a model of the brevity\r\nwhich is the test of wit, \"Frons occipitio prior est.\" Pliny probably\r\nquoting from memory, expands it to \"Frons domini plus prodest quam\r\noccípitíum.\" Palladius (I, 6) gives another version: \"Praesentia\r\ndomini provectus est agri.\" It is found in some form in almost every\r\nbook on agriculture since Cato, until we reach the literature in which\r\nscience has taken the place of wisdom--in the Byzantine _Geoponica_,\r\nthe Italian _Crescenzi_, the Dutch _Heresbach_, the French _Maison\r\nRustique_, and the English _Gervase Markkam. Poor Richard's Almanack_\r\ngives it twice, as \"the foot of a master is the best manure\" and\r\n\"the eye of a master will do more work than both his hands.\" It is\r\nperennial in its appeal. The present editor saw it recently in the\r\nGerman comic paper _Fliegende Blätter_. But the jest is much older\r\nthan Cato. It appears in Aeschylus, _Persae_, 171 and Xenophon employs\r\nit in _Oeconomicus_ (XII, 20):\r\n\r\n\"The reply attributed to the barbarian,\" added Ischomachus, \"appears\r\nto me to be exceedingly to the purpose, for when the King of Persia\r\nhaving met with a fine horse and wishing to have it fattened as soon\r\nas possible, asked one of those who were considered knowing about\r\nhorses what would fatten a horse soonest, it is said that he answered\r\n'the master's eye.'\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: The English word \"orchard\" scarcely translates\r\n_arbustum_, but every one who has been in Italy will recall the\r\nendless procession of small fields of maize and rye and alfalfa\r\nthrough which serried ranks of mulberry or feathery elm trees, linked\r\nwith the charming drop and garland of the vines, seem to dance toward\r\none in the brilliant sunlight, like so many Greek maidens on a frieze.\r\nThese are _arbusta_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Cato was a strong advocate of the cabbage; he called\r\nit the best of the vegetables and urged that it be planted in every\r\ngarden for health and happiness. Horace records (Odes. III, 21, 11)\r\nthat old Cato's virtue was frequently warmed with wine, and Cato\r\nhimself explains (CLVI) how this could be accomplished without loss\r\nof dignity, for, he says, if, after you have dined well, you will eat\r\nfive cabbage leaves they will make you feel as if you had had nothing\r\nto drink, so that you can drink as much more as you wish--\"bibesque\r\nquantum voles!\"\r\n\r\nThis was an ancient Egyptian precaution which the Greeks had learned.\r\nCf. Athenaeus, I, 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Henry Home, Lord Kames, a Scots judge of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, whom Dr. Johnson considered a better farmer than judge and a\r\nbetter judge than scholar, but who had many of the characteristics of\r\nour _priscus_ Cato, argues (following an English tradition which\r\nhad previously been voiced by Walter of Henley and Sir Anthony\r\nFitzherbert) in his ingenious _Gentleman Farmer_ against the expense\r\nof ploughing with horses and urges a return to oxen. He points out\r\nthat horses involve a large original investment, are worn out in farm\r\nwork, and after their prime steadily depreciate in value; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the ox can be fattened for market when his usefulness\r\nas a draught animal is over, and then sell for more than his original\r\ncost; that he is less subject to infirmities than the horse; can\r\nbe fed per tractive unit more economically and gives more valuable\r\nmanure. These are strong arguments where the cost of human labour is\r\nsmall and economical farm management does not require that the time of\r\nthe ploughman shall be limited if the unit cost of ploughing is to be\r\nreasonable. The ox is slow, but in slave times he might reasonably\r\nhave been preferred to the horse. Today Lord Kames, (or even old\r\nHesiod, who urged that a ploughman of forty year and a yoke of eight\r\nyear steers be employed because they turned a more deliberate and so a\r\nbetter furrow) would be considering the economical practicability of\r\nthe gasolene motor as tractive power for a gang of \"crooked\" ploughs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Cato adds a long list of implements and other necessary\r\nequipment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: The Roman overseer was usually a superior, and often a\r\nmuch indulged, slave. Cf. Horace's letter (_Epist._ I, 14) to his\r\noverseer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: This was the traditional wisdom which was preached also\r\nin Virginia in slave times. In his Arator (1817) Col. John Taylor of\r\nCaroline says of agricultural slaves:\r\n\r\n\"The best source for securing their happiness, their honesty and\r\ntheir usefulness is their food.... One great value of establishing a\r\ncomfortable diet for slaves is its convenience as an instrument of\r\nreward and punishment, so powerful as almost to abolish the thefts\r\nwhich often diminish considerably the owner's ability to provide for\r\nthem.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Reading \"compitalibus in compito,\" literally \"the cross\r\nroads altar on festival days.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: It is evident that Cato's housekeeper would have welcomed\r\na visit from Mr. Roosevelt's Rural Uplift Commission. We may add to\r\nthis Sir Anthony Fitzherbert's description of the duties of a farmer's\r\nwife in sixteenth century England:\r\n\r\n\"It is a wyues occupation to wynowe all maner of cornes, to make\r\nmalte, to wasshe and wrynge, to make heye, shere corne, and in tyme of\r\nnede to helpe her husbande to fyll the mucke-wayne or dounge-carte,\r\ndryue the ploughe, to loode hey, corne and suche other. And to go\r\nor ride to the market, to sel butter, chese, mylke, egges, chekyns,\r\ncapons, hennes, pygges, gese, and all maner of cornes. And also to bye\r\nall maner of necessarye thynges belongynge to houssholde, and to make\r\na trewe rekenynge and acompte to her husbande what she hath payed.\"\r\n\r\nSir Anthony Fitzherbert (1470-1538) was the English judge whose\r\nlaw books are, or should be, known to all lawyers. His _Boke of\r\nHusbandry_, published in 1534, is one of the classics of English\r\nagriculture, and justly, for it is full of shrewd observation and\r\ndeliberate wisdom expressed in a virile style, with agreeable leaven\r\nof piety and humour. Fitzherbert anticipated a modern poet, Henley, in\r\none of his most happy phrases: \"Ryght so euery man is capitayne of his\r\nowne soule\". The Husbandry is best available to the modern reader in\r\nthe edition by Skeat published for the English Dialect Society in\r\n1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Cato is careful not to undertake to say how this may be\r\nassured; another evidence of his wisdom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: In his instructive discourse on ploughing, Columella (II,\r\n4) gives the key to Cato's warning against ploughing land when it is\r\nin the condition he calls rotten (_cariosa_):\r\n\r\n\"Rich land, which holds moisture a long time, should be broken up\r\n(_proscindere_) at the season when the weather is beginning to be warm\r\nand the weeds are developing, so that none of their seed may mature:\r\nbut it should be ploughed with such close furrows that one can with\r\ndifficulty distinguish where the plough share has been, for in that\r\nway all the weeds are uprooted and destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"The spring ploughing should be followed up with frequent stirring\r\nof the soil until it is reduced to dust, so that there may be no\r\nnecessity, or very little, of harrowing after the land is seeded: for\r\nthe ancient Romans said that a field was badly ploughed which had to\r\nbe harrowed after the seed had been sown.\r\n\r\n\"A farmer should himself make sure that his ploughing has been well\r\ndone, not alone by inspection, for the eye is often amused by a smooth\r\nsurface which in fact conceals clods, but also by experiment, which is\r\nless likely to be deceived, as by driving a stout stick through the\r\nfurrows: if it penetrates the soil readily and without obstruction, it\r\nwill be evident that all the land there about is in good order: but if\r\nsome part harder than the rest resists the pressure, it will be clear\r\nthat the ploughing has been badly done. When the ploughmen see this\r\ndone from time to time they are not guilty of clod hopping.\r\n\r\n\"Hence wet land should be broken up after the Ides of April, and, when\r\nit has been ploughed at that season, it should be worked again, after\r\nan interval of twenty days, about the time of the solstice, which is\r\nthe eighth or ninth day before the Kalends of July, and again the\r\nthird time about the Kalends of September, for it is not the practice\r\nof experienced farmers to till the land in the interval after the\r\nsummer solstice, unless the ground shall have been soaked with a heavy\r\ndown-pour of sudden rain, like those of winter, as does some times\r\nhappen at this season. In that event there is no reason why the fallow\r\nshould not be cultivated during the month of July. But when you do\r\ntill at this season beware lest the land be worked while it is muddy:\r\nor when, having been sprinkled by a shower, it is in the condition\r\nwhich the country people call _varia_ and _cariosa_, that is to say,\r\nwhen, after a long drought, a light rain has moistened the surface of\r\nthe upturned sod but has not soaked to the bottom of the furrow.\r\n\r\n\"Those plough lands which are cultivated when they are miry are\r\nrendered useless for an entire year--they can be neither seeded nor\r\nharrowed nor hoed--but those which are worked when they are in the\r\nstate which has been described as varia, remain sterile for three\r\nyears on end. We should, therefore, follow a medium course and plough\r\nwhen the land neither lacks moisture nor yet is deep in marsh.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Columella (II, 13) justly says about manure, \"Wherefore\r\nif it is, as it would seem to be, the thing of the greatest value to\r\nthe farmer, I consider that it should be studied with the greatest\r\ncare, especially since the ancient authors, while they have not\r\naltogether neglected it, have nevertheless discussed it with too\r\nlittle elaboration.\" He goes on (II, 14) to lay down rules about the\r\ncompost heap which should be written in letters of gold in every farm\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate that there are certain kinds of farms on which it is\r\nimpossible to keep either live stock or birds, yet even in such places\r\nit is a lazy farmer who lacks manure: for he can collect leaves,\r\nrubbish from the hedge rows, and droppings from the high ways: without\r\ngiving offence, and indeed earning gratitude, he can cut ferns from\r\nhis neighbour's land: and all these things he can mingle with the\r\nsweepings of the courtyard: he can dig a pit, like that we have\r\ncounselled for the protection of stable manure, and there mix together\r\nashes, sewage, and straw, and indeed every waste thing which is swept\r\nup on the place. But it is wise to bury a piece of oak wood in the\r\nmidst of this compost, for that will prevent venomous snakes from\r\nlurking in it. This will suffice for a farm without live stock.\"\r\n\r\nOne can see in Flanders today the happy land smiling its appreciation\r\nof farm management such as this, but what American farmer has yet\r\nlearned this kind of conservation of his natural resources.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: The occupants of the motor cars which now roll so swiftly\r\nand so comfortably along the French national highway from Paris to\r\nTours, through the pleasant _pays de Beauce_, can see this admirable\r\nand economical method of manuring still in practice. The sheep are\r\nfolded and fed at night, under the watchful eye of the shepherd\r\nstretched at ease in his wheeled cabin, on the land which was ploughed\r\nthe day before.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: These of course are all legumes. The intelligent farmer\r\ntoday sits under his shade tree and meditates comfortably upon the\r\nleast expensive and most profitable labour on his farm, the countless\r\nmillions of beneficent bacteria who, his willing slaves, are\r\nceaselessly at work during hot weather forming root tubercles on his\r\nlegumes, be it clover or cow peas, and so fixing for their lord the\r\nfree atmospheric nitrogen contained in the soil. As Macaulay would\r\nsay, \"every school boy knows\" now that leguminous root nodules are\r\nendotrophic mycorrhiza,--but the Romans did not! Nevertheless their\r\nempirical practice of soil improvement with legumes was quite as good\r\nas ours. Varro (I, 23) explains the Roman method of green manuring\r\nmore fully than Cato. Columella (II, 13) insists further that if the\r\nhay is saved the stubble of legumes should be promptly ploughed for he\r\nsays the roots will evaporate their own moisture and continue to pump\r\nthe land of its fertility unless they are at once turned over.\r\n\r\nIf the Romans followed this wise advice they were better farmers than\r\nmost of us today, for we are usually content to let the stubble dry\r\nout before ploughing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Was this ensilage? The ancients had their silo pits, but\r\nthey used them chiefly as granaries, and as such they are described,\r\nby Varro (I, 57, 63), by Columella (I, 6), and by Pliny (XVIII, 30,\r\n73).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The extravagant American farmer has not yet learned\r\nto feed the leaves of trees, but in older and more economical\r\ncivilizations the practice is still observed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Amurca was the dregs of olive oil. Cato recommends its\r\nuse for many purposes in the economy of the farm, for a moth proof\r\n(XCVIII), as a relish for cattle (CIII), as a fertilizer (CXXX), and\r\nas an anointment for the threshing floor to kill weevil (XCI).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: There is a similar remedy for scratches in horses, which\r\nis traditional in the cavalry service today, and is extraordinarily\r\nefficacious.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Cf. Pliny _H.N._ XVII, 267 and Fraser, _The Golden\r\nBough_, XI, 177. The principle is one of magical homeopathy: as the\r\nsplit reed, when bound together, may cohere and heal by the medicine\r\nof the incantation, so may the broken bone.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: These examples will serve to illustrate how far Cato's\r\nveterinary science was behind his agriculture, and what a curious\r\nconfusion of native good sense and traditional superstition there was\r\nin his method of caring for his live stock. On questions of preventing\r\nmalady he had the wisdom of experience, but malady once arrived he was\r\na simple pagan. There was a notable advance in the Roman knowledge of\r\nhow to treat sick cattle in the century after Cato. Cf. Varro, II, 5.\r\n\r\nThe words of the incantations themselves are mere sound and fury\r\nsignifying nothing, like the \"counting out\" rhythms used by children\r\nat their games.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Cato gives many recipes of household as well as\r\nagricultural economy. Out of respect for the pure food law most of\r\nthem have been here suppressed, but these samples are ventured because\r\nVarro mentions them and the editor is advised that some enterprising\r\nyoung ladies in Wisconsin have recently had the courage to put them to\r\nthe test, and vow that they ate their handiwork! As they live to tell\r\nthe tale, it is assumed that the recipes are harmless.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Cf. the following traditional formula as practised in\r\nVirginia:\r\n\r\nA VIRGINIA RECIPE FOR CURING HAMS\r\n\r\n\"Rub each ham separately with ½ teaspoonful of saltpetre (use a small\r\nspoon); then rub each ham with a large tablespoonfulof best black\r\npepper; then rub each ham with a gill of molasses (black strap is\r\nbest).\r\n\r\n  Then for 1,000 lbs. of ham take\r\n    3-1/4 pecks of coarse salt,\r\n    2-1/2 lbs. of saltpetre,\r\n    2 qts. hickory ashes,\r\n    2 qts. molasses,\r\n    2 teacupfuls of red pepper.\r\n\r\n\"Mix all together on the salting table. Then rub each ham with this\r\nmixture, and, in packing, spread some of it on each layer of ham. Use\r\nno more salt than has been mixed. Pack skin down and let stand for\r\nfive weeks, then hang in the smoke house for five or six weeks, and\r\nsmoke in damp weather, using hickory wood.\r\n\r\n\"As a ham, however well cured, is of no use to civilized man until it\r\nis cooked, and as this crowning mystery is seldom revealed out of\r\nVirginia, it may not be out of place to record here the process.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA VIRGINIA RECIPE FOR COOKING HAMS\r\n\r\nSoak over night in cold water, having first scrubbed the ham with a\r\nsmall brush to remove all the pepper, saltpetre, etc., left from the\r\ncuring process.\r\n\r\nPut on to boil next morning in tepid water, skin downwards, letting\r\nit simmer on back of stove, never to boil hard. This takes about four\r\nhours (or until it is done, when the ham is supposed to turn over,\r\nskin upwards, of its own accord, as it will if the boiler is large\r\nenough). Set aside over another night in the water it has boiled in.\r\n\r\nThe _following_ day, skin and bake in the oven, having covered the ham\r\nwell with brown sugar, basting at intervals with cider. When it is\r\nwell baked, take it out of the oven and baste another ten to twenty\r\nminutes in the pan on top of the stove. The sugar crust should be\r\nquite brown and crisp when done.\r\n\r\nTo be thoroughly appreciated a ham should be carved on the table, by a\r\npretty woman. A thick slice of ham is a crime against good breeding.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: It is interesting that Varro has realized the hope,\r\nhere expressed, that his wisdom might survive for the benefit of the\r\n\"uttermost generations of men\" chiefly in the case of this treatise\r\non Husbandry among the many monuments of his industry and learning.\r\nPetrarch in his _Epistle to Varro_ in that first delightful book of\r\nLetters to Dead Authors (_de rebus familiaribus_ XXIV, 6) rehearses\r\nthe loss of Varro's books and, adapting the thought here expressed in\r\nthe text, regrets for that reason that Varro cannot be included in\r\nthat company of men \"whom we love even after their death owing to\r\nthe good and righteous deeds that live after them, men who mold our\r\ncharacter by their teaching and comfort us by their example, when\r\nthe rest of mankind offends both our eyes and our nostrils; men who,\r\nthough they have gone hence to the common abode of all (as Plautus\r\nsays in Casina), nevertheless continue to be of service to the\r\nliving.\" If Petrarch had been a farmer he might have saved some of his\r\nregret, for Varro is surely, by virtue of the _Rerum Rusticarum_, a\r\nmember of the fellowship Petrarch describes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Varro was essentially an antiquary and it is amusing\r\nto observe that he is unable to suppress his learning even in his\r\nprayers. One is reminded of the anecdote of the New England minister,\r\nwho, in the course of an unctuous prayer, proclaimed, with magisterial\r\nauthority, \"Paradoxical as it may appear, O Lord, it is nevertheless\r\ntrue, etc.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: Following Plato and Xenophon and Cicero, Varro cast his\r\nbooks into the form of dialogues to make them entertaining (\"and what\r\nis the use of a book,\" thought Alice in Wonderland, \"without pictures\r\nor conversations.\"): for the same reason he was careful about his\r\nlocal colour. Thus the scene of this first book, which relates to\r\nagriculture proper, is laid at Rome in the temple of Earth on the\r\nfestival of the Seed Sowing, and the characters bear names of punning\r\nreference to the tilling of the soil. Varro was strong on puns,\r\navowing (Cicero _Acad_. I, 2) that that form of humour made it easier\r\nfor people of small intelligence to swallow his learning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: The story is that when Scipio captured Carthage he\r\ndistributed the Punic libraries among the native allies, reserving\r\nonly the agricultural works of Mago, which the Roman Senate\r\nsubsequently ordered to be translated into Latin, so highly were they\r\nesteemed. Probably more real wealth was brought to Rome in the pages\r\nof these precious volumes than was represented by all the other\r\nplunder of Carthage. \"The improving a kingdom in matter of husbandry\r\nis better than conquering a new kingdom,\" says old Samuel Hartlib,\r\nMilton's friend, in his _Legacie_. It is a curious fact that as the\r\nRomans derived agricultural wisdom from their ancient enemies, so did\r\nthe English. Cf. Thorold Rogers' _Six Centuries of Work and Wages_.\r\n\"We owe the improvements in English agriculture to Holland. From this\r\ncountry we borrowed, at the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nthe cultivation of winter roots, and, at that of the eighteenth, the\r\nartificial grasses. The Dutch had practised agriculture with the\r\npatient and minute industry of market gardeners. They had tried\r\nsuccessfully to cultivate every thing to the uttermost, which could be\r\nused for human food, or could give innocent gratification to a refined\r\ntaste. They taught agriculture and they taught gardening. They were\r\nthe first people to surround their homesteads with flower beds, with\r\ngroves, with trim parterres, with the finest turf, to improve fruit\r\ntrees, to seek out and perfect edible roots and herbs at once for man\r\nand cattle. We owe to the Dutch that scurvy and leprosy have been\r\nbanished from England, that continuous crops have taken the place of\r\nbarren fallows, that the true rotation of crops has been discovered\r\nand perfected, that the population of these islands has been increased\r\nand that the cattle and sheep in England are ten times what they were\r\nin numbers and three times what they were in size and quality.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: The Roman proverb which Agrius had in mind reminds one of\r\nthe witty French woman's comment upon the achievement of St. Denis in\r\nwalking several miles to Montmartre, after his head had been cut off,\r\n(as all the world can still see him doing in the verrières of Notre\r\nDame de Chartres): \"en pareil cas, ce n'est que le premier pas qui\r\ncoûte.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: To this glowing description of agricultural Italy in\r\nthe Augustan age may be annexed that of Machiavelli on the state of\r\nTuscany in his youth: \"Ridotta tutta in somma pace e tranquillità,\r\ncoltivata non meno ne' luoghi più montuosi e più sterili che nelle\r\npianure e regioni più fertili....\" It is our privilege to see the\r\nimage of this fruitful cultivation of the mountain tops not only in\r\nMachiavelli's prose, but on the walls of the Palazzo Riccardi in\r\nGozzoli's _Journey of the Magi_, where, like King Robert of Sicily,\r\nthe Magi crossed\r\n\r\n  \"Into the lovely land of Italy\r\n  Whose loveliness was more resplendent made\r\n  By the mere passing of that cavalcade.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems almost a pity to contrast with these the comment of a careful\r\nand sympathetic student of the agricultural Italy of the age of\r\nKing Umberto: \"To return to the question of the natural richness of\r\nagricultural Italy,\" says Dr. W.N. Beauclerk in his _Rural Italy_\r\n(1888), \"we may compare the words of the German ballad: 'In Italy\r\nmacaroni ready cooked rains from the sky, and the vines are festooned\r\nwith sausages,' with the words today rife throughout the Kingdom,\r\n'Rural Italy is poor and miserable, and has no future in store for\r\nher.' The fact is that Italy is rich in capabilities of production,\r\nbut exhausted in spontaneous fertility. Her vast forests have been cut\r\ndown, giving place to sterile and malarious ground: the plains and\r\nshores formerly covered with wealthy and populous cities are now\r\ndeserted marshes: Sardinia and other ancient granaries of the Roman\r\nEmpire are empty and unproductive: two-thirds of the Kingdom are\r\noccupied by mountains impossible of cultivation, and the remainder is\r\nto a large extent ill-farmed and unremunerative. To call Italy the\r\n'Garden of Europe' under these circumstances seems cruel irony.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: As we may assume that the yields of wine of which\r\nFundanius boasts were the largest of which Varro had information in\r\nthe Italy of his time, it is interesting to compare them with the\r\nlargest yields of the most productive wine country of France today.\r\nFifteen cullei, or three hundred amphorae per jugerum, is the\r\nequivalent of 2700 gallons per acre: while according to P. Joigneaux,\r\nin the _Livre de la Ferme_, the largest yields in modern France are\r\nin the Midi (specifically Herault), where in exceptional cases they\r\namount to as much as 250 hectolitres to the hectare, or say 2672\r\ngallons per acre. It may be noted that the yields of the best modern\r\nwines, like Burgundy, are less than half of this, and it is probable\r\nthat the same was true of the _vinum Setinum_ of Augustus, if not of\r\nthe Horatian Massic.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: The modern Italian opinion of farming in a fertile but\r\nunhealthy situation is expressed with a grim humour in the Tuscan\r\nproverb: \"in Maremma s'arricchisce in un anno, si muore in sei mesi.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: This is Keil's ingenious interpretation of an obscure\r\npassage. We may compare the English designation of a church yard as\r\n\"God's acre.\" What Licinius Crassus actually did was, while haranguing\r\nfrom the rostra, to turn his back upon the Comitium, where the\r\nSenators gathered, and address himself directly to the people\r\nassembled in the Forum. The act was significant as indicating that the\r\nsovereignty had changed place.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Tremelius Scrofa was the author of a treatise on\r\nagriculture, which Columella cites, but which has not otherwise\r\nsurvived.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: \"It was a received opinion amongst the antients that a\r\nlarge, busy, well peopled village, situated in a country thoroughly\r\ncultivated, was a more magnificent sight than the palaces of noblemen\r\nand princes in the midst of neglected lands.\" Harte's _Essays on\r\nHusbandry_, p. 11. This is a delightful book, the ripe product of a\r\ngentleman and a scholar. In the middle of the eighteenth century it\r\nadvocated what we are still advocating--that agriculture, as the basis\r\nof national wealth, deserves the study and attention of the highest\r\nintelligence; specifically it proposed the introduction of new grasses\r\nand forage crops (alfalfa above all others) to enable the land to\r\nsupport more live stock. It was published in 1764, just after France\r\nhad ceded to England by the Treaty of Paris all of her possessions in\r\nAmerica east of the Mississippi River; and not the least interesting\r\npassages of Harte's book are those proposing an agricultural\r\ndevelopment of the newly acquired territory between Lake Illinois\r\n(Michigan) and the Mississippi, which he suggests may be readily\r\nbrought under cultivation with the aid of the buffaloes of the\r\ncountry. He shrewdly says: \"Maize may be raised in this part of Canada\r\nto what quantity we please, for it grows there naturally in great\r\nabundance.\" It happened, however, that a few years later, in 1778,\r\nCol. George Rogers Clark of Virginia made a certain expedition through\r\nthe wilderness to the British outpost at Vincennes, which saved\r\nEngland the trouble of taking Harte's advice, but that it has not been\r\nneglected may be evident from the fact that less than a century and\r\na half later, or in 1910, the State of Illinois produced 415 million\r\nbushels of maize, besides twice as much oats and half as much wheat as\r\ndid old England herself in the same year of grace.\r\n\r\nHarte was the travelling governor of that young Mr. Stanhope, to whom\r\nmy lord Chesterfield wrote his famous worldly wise letters. He was the\r\nauthor also of a _Life of Gustavus Adolphus_, which was a failure. Dr.\r\nJohnson, who liked Harte, said: \"It was unlucky in coming out on the\r\nsame day with Robertson's _History of Scotland_. His _Husbandry_,\r\nhowever, is good.\" (_Boswell_, IV, 91). With this judgment of Dr.\r\nJohnson there has been, and must be, general concurrence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Pliny records (H.N. XVIII, 7) that at Lucullus' farm\r\nthere was less ground for ploughing than of floor for sweeping.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Eggs were the first course, as apples were the last, at a\r\nRoman dinner, hence the saying \"ab ovo usque ad mala.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Cf. Gilbert Murray's version of Euripides' _Troades_,\r\n799:\r\n\r\n  In Salamis, filled with the foaming\r\n    Of billows and murmur of bees,\r\n  Old Telamon stayed from his roaming,\r\n    Long ago, on a throne of the seas;\r\n  Looking out on the hills olive laden,\r\n    Enchanted, where first from the earth.\r\n  The gray-gleaming fruit of the Maiden\r\n    Athena had birth.\r\n\r\nThe physical reason why the olive flourished in Attica, as\r\nTheophrastus points out (C.P.V. II, 2), was because it craves a thin\r\nsoil, and that of Attica, with its out-croppings of calcareous rock,\r\nsuits the olive perfectly, while fit for little else agricultural.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: In the _Geoponica_ (XIII, 15) there has been preserved a\r\nremedy for a similar evil, which, in all fairness, should be credited\r\nto Saserna. In any event, it is what the newspapers used to call\r\n\"important, if true,\" viz: \"If ever you come into a place where fleas\r\nabound, cry Och! Och! ([Greek: och, och]) and they will not touch\r\nyou.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: The editor of an Iowa farm journal, who has been making\r\na study of agricultural Europe, has recently reported an interesting\r\ncomparison between the results of extensive farming as practised in\r\nIowa and intensive farming as practised in Bavaria. He begins with\r\nthe thesis that the object of agriculture is to put the energy of the\r\nsun's rays into forms which animals and human beings can use, and,\r\nreducing the crop production of each country to thermal units, he\r\nfinds \"that for every man, woman and child connected with farming in\r\nIowa 14,200 therms of sun's energy were imprisoned, while for every\r\nman, woman and child connected with farming in Bavaria only 2,600\r\ntherms were stored up. In other words, the average Iowa farmer is six\r\ntimes as successful in his efforts to capture the power of the sun's\r\nrays as the average Bavarian farmer. On the other hand, the average\r\nacre of Iowa land is only about one-seventh as successful as the\r\naverage acre of Bavarian land in supporting those who live on it. If\r\nwe look on land as the unit, then the Bavarians get better results\r\nthan we in Iowa, but if we look on human labor as the unit, then the\r\nIowa farmers are far ahead of those of Bavaria.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that if the Iowa farmer, who gets his results by\r\nthe use of machinery, was to adopt also the intensive practice of the\r\nBavarian farmer, he would secure at once the greatest efficiency per\r\nacre and per man, and that is the true purpose of agriculture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: It is one of the charms of Varro's treatise that he\r\nalways insists cheerfully on the pleasure to be derived from the land.\r\nIt is the same spirit which Conington has remarked cropping out in\r\nmany places in Virgil's _Georgics_--the joy of the husbandman in his\r\nwork, as in the \"iuvat\" of\r\n\r\n                 \"iuvat Ismara Baccho\r\n  Conserere, atque olea magnum vestire Taburnum.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the blessed \"surcease of sorrow\" of which the crowded life of\r\nthe modern city knows nothing: but, as the practical Roman indicates,\r\nit will not support life of its own mere motion. Cf. Dr. Johnson's\r\npicture of Shenstone: \"He began from this time to entangle his walks\r\nand to wind his waters: which he did with such judgment and such fancy\r\nas made his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration of\r\nthe skillful. His house was mean, and he did not improve it: his care\r\nwas of his grounds.... In time his expences brought clamours about\r\nhim, that overpowered the lambs' bleat and the linnets' song; and his\r\ngroves were haunted by beings very different from fawns and fairies.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: Walter of Henley, in thirteenth century England, drove\r\nhome a shrewd comment on the country gentleman who farms without\r\nkeeping accounts and thinks he is engaged in a profitable industry.\r\n\"You know surely,\" he says, \"that an acre sown with wheat takes three\r\nploughings, except lands which are sown yearly, and that one with\r\nanother each ploughing is worth six pence, and harrowing a penny,\r\nand on the acre it is necessary to sow at least two bushels. Now two\r\nbushels at Michaelmas are worth at least twelve pence, and weeding a\r\nhalf penny and reaping five pence, and carrying in August a penny: the\r\nstraw will pay for the threshing. At three times your sowing you ought\r\nto have six bushels, worth three shillings; and the cost amounts to\r\nthree shillings and three half pence, and the ground is yours and not\r\nreckoned.\"\r\n\r\nOf Walter of Henley little is known, but it is conjectured that he was\r\nthe bailiff of the manors near Henley which belonged to the Abbey of\r\nCanterbury. His curious and valuable _Dite de Hosebondrie_, which is\r\nas original in its way as Cato's treatise, being entirely free from\r\nmere literary tradition, is now available to the modern reader in\r\na translation, from the original barbarous English law French, by\r\nElizabeth Lamond, made for the Royal Historical Society in 1890.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: This was just before Pharsalia, and the army was that of\r\nPompey which Varro had joined after surrendering to Caesar in Spain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: In this enumeration of trees Varro does not include the\r\nchestnut which is now one of the features of the Italian mountain\r\nlandscape and furnishes support for a considerable part of the Italian\r\npopulation, who subsist on _necci_, those indigestible chestnut flour\r\ncakes, just as the Irish peasants do on potatoes. The chestnut was\r\nlate in getting a foothold in Italy but it was there in Varro's day.\r\nHe mentions the nuts as part of the diet of dormice (III, 15).\r\n\r\nBy the thirteenth century chestnuts had become an established article\r\nof human food in Italy. Pietro Crescenzi (1230-1307) describes two\r\nvarieties, the cultivated and the wild, and quotes the Arabian\r\nphysician Avicenna to the effect that chestnuts are \"di tarda\r\ndigestione ma di buono nuttimento.\" It is perhaps for this very reason\r\nthat chestnut bread is acceptable to those engaged in heavy labor.\r\nFynes Moryson says in his _Itinerary_ (1617) that maslin bread made\r\nof a mixture of rye and wheat flour was used by labourers in England\r\nbecause it \"abode longer in the stomach and was not so soon digested\r\nwith their labour.\"\r\n\r\nCrescenzi, who was a lawyer and a judge, says in his preface that he\r\nhad left his native Bologna because of the civil strifes, had taken\r\nforeign service in several parts of Italy, and so had opportunity to\r\nsee the world. He wrote his book on agriculture because, as he says,\r\nof all the things he learned on his travels there was nothing \"piu a\r\nbondevole, niuna piu dolce, et niuna piu degna de l'huomo libero,\" a\r\nsentiment which Socrates had expressed sixteen hundred years earlier\r\nand which was echoed six hundred years later by another far-sighted\r\nItalian, the statesman Cavour.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: The white chalk which Scrofa saw used as manure in\r\nTransalpine Gaul, when he was serving in the army under Julius Caesar,\r\nwas undoubtedly marl, the use of which in that region as in Britain\r\nwas subsequently noted by Pliny (H.N. XVII, 4).\r\n\r\nThere were no deposits of marl in Italy, and so the Romans knew\r\nnothing of its use, from experience, but Pliny's treatment of the\r\nsubject shows a sound source of information. In England, where several\r\nkinds of marl are found in quantities, its use was probably never\r\ndiscontinued after the Roman times. Walter of Henley discusses its use\r\nin the thirteenth century, and Sir Anthony Fitzherbert continues the\r\ndiscussion in the sixteenth century. In connection with the history of\r\nthe use of marl in agriculture may be cited the tender tribute which\r\nArthur Young recorded on the tombstone of his wife in Bradfield\r\nChurch. The lady's chief virtue appears to have been, in the memory\r\nof her husband, that she was \"the great-grand-daughter of John\r\nAllen, esq. of Lyng House in the County of Norfolk, the first person\r\naccording to the Comte de Boulainvilliers, who there used marl.\"\r\n\r\nThe Romans did not have the fight against sour land which is the\r\nheritage of the modern farmer after years of continuous application\r\nto his land of phosphoric and sulphuric acid in the form of mineral\r\nfertilizers. What sour land the Romans had they corrected with humus\r\nmaking barnyard manure, or the rich compost which Cato and Columella\r\nrecommend. They had, however, a test for sourness of land which is\r\nstill practised even where the convenient litmus paper is available.\r\nVirgil (_Georgic_ II, 241) gives the formula: \"Fill a basket with\r\nsoil, and strain fresh water through it. The taste of water strained\r\nthrough sour soil will twist awry the taster's face.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: This sounds like the boast of the modern proprietor of an\r\nold blue grass sod in Northern Virginia or Kentucky. On the general\r\nquestion of pasture vs. arable land, cf. Hartlib's _Legacie_: \"It is a\r\nmisfortune that pasture lands are not more improved. England abounds\r\nin pasturage more than any other country, and is, therefore, richer.\r\nIn France, acre for acre, the land is not comparable to ours: and,\r\ntherefore, Fortescue, chancellor to Henry VI, observes that we get\r\nmore in England by standing still (alluding to our meadows) than the\r\nFrench do by working (that is, cultivating their vineyards and corn\r\nlands).\"\r\n\r\nWe may permit Montesquieu (_Esprit des Lois_ II, 23, 14) to voice the\r\nFrench side of this question. \"Les pais de pâturage sont pen peuplês.\r\nLes terres à bled occupent plus d'hommes et les vignobles infiniment\r\nd'avantage. En Angleterre on s'est souvent plaint que l'augmentation\r\ndes pâturage diminuoit les habitans.\"\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to his Book Two (_post_, p. 179) Varro states the\r\nsound conclusion, that the two kinds of husbandry should be combined\r\non the same land. Sir Anthony Fitzherbert knew this: \"An housbande can\r\nnot well thryue by his corne without he haue other cattell, nor by his\r\ncattell without corne. For els he shall be a byer, a borrower or a\r\nbeggar.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: This is the explanation of why Aesop's fox found the\r\ngrapes to be sour which grew on a trellis, for he had expected to find\r\nthem of easy access on the ground. Aesop was a Phrygian, and, while\r\nBentley has proved that Aesop never wrote the existing fables which go\r\nby that name, yet it is recognized that they are of Oriental origin\r\nand it is evident that that of the Fox and the Grapes came out of\r\nAsia, where, as Varro says, the grapes were usually allowed to grow on\r\nthe ground.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 65: One is tempted to include here Pliny's observations upon\r\nthe tests of good soil if only for the sake of his description of one\r\nof the sweetest sensations of the farmer every where, the aroma of new\r\nploughed fertile land:--\r\n\r\n\"Those unguents which have a taste of earth are better,\" says Cicero,\r\n\"than those which smack of saffron,\" it seeming to him more to the\r\npurpose to express himself by the word taste than smell. And such is\r\nthe fact no doubt, that soil is the best which has the savour of a\r\nperfume. If the question should be put to us, what is this odour of\r\nthe earth that is held in such estimation; our answer is that it\r\nis the same that is often to be recognized at the moment of sunset\r\nwithout the necessity even of turning up the ground, at the spots\r\nwhere the extremities of the rainbow have been observed to meet the\r\nearth: as also, when after long continued drought, the rain has soaked\r\nthe ground. Then it is that the earth exhales the divine odour that is\r\nso peculiarly its own, and to which, imparted to it by the sun, there\r\nis no perfume however sweet that can possibly be compared. It is this\r\nodour which the earth, when turned up, ought to emit, and which, when\r\nonce found, can never deceive any person: and this will be found the\r\nbest criterion for judging of the quality of the soil. Such, too, is\r\nthe odour that is usually perceived in land newly cleared when an\r\nancient forest has been just cut down; its excellence is a thing that\r\nis universally admitted.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 66: The _actus_ was the head land or as much land as a yoke\r\nof oxen could plough at a single spell without stopping, and measured\r\n120 feet in length and four feet in width. Cf. Pliny, H.N. XVIII, 3.\r\nHence the square of the head land became the basis of the Roman land\r\nmeasure. With the derivation of the _actus_ may be compared that of\r\nthe English furlong (furrow-long) and the French _arpent_ (literally,\r\nhead land).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: On the socialistic principle of Strepsiades in\r\nAristophanes' _Clouds_ that the use of geometry is to divide the land\r\ninto _equal_ parts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: As it is difficult to appreciate that the Roman Campagna\r\nwas formerly populous with villas, when one contemplates its green\r\nsolitudes today, so when one faces the dread malaria which there\r\nbreeds, one wonders how the Romans of the Republic maintained so long\r\ntheir hardy constitutions. It is now agreed that there was no malaria\r\nin the Land of Saturn so long as the volcanos in the Alban hills\r\nwere active, because their gases purified the air and kept down the\r\nmosquitoes, and geology tells us that Monte Pila was in eruption for\r\ntwo or three centuries after the foundation of Rome. By the beginning\r\nof the second century B.C. the fever seems to have become endemic.\r\nPlautus and Terence both mention it and Cato (CLVII) describes its\r\nsymptoms unmistakably. In his book on the effect of malaria in\r\nhistory, W.H. Jones expresses the opinion that the malady was brought\r\ninto Italy from Africa by Hannibal's soldiers, but it is more probable\r\nthat it was always there. See the discussion in Lanciani's _Wanderings\r\nin the Roman Campagna_. In Varro's time the Roman fever had begun to\r\nsap the vitality of the Roman people, and the \"animalia minuta\" in\r\nthis passage suggests that Varro had a curious appreciation of what\r\nwe call the modern science of the subject. Columella (I, 5, 6) indeed\r\nspecifically mentions mosquitoes (infestis aculeis armata animalia) as\r\none of the risks incident to living near a swamp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: In the thirteenth century Ibn-al-Awam, a learned Moor,\r\nwrote at Seville his _Kitab al-felahah_, or Book of Agriculture, which\r\nhas preserved for us not only the wisdom of the Moorish practice in\r\nagriculture and gardening which made Spain an enchanted paradise, but\r\nalso the tradition of the Arabs in such matters, purporting to go\r\nback, through the Nabataeans to the Chaldaean books, which recorded\r\nthe agricultural methods that obtained \"by the waters of Babylon.\"\r\nIbn-al-Awam's book has, therefore, a double interest for us, and\r\nwe are fortunate in having it available in an admirable French\r\ntranslation from the Arabic by J.J. Clement-Mullet (Paris, Librairie\r\nA. Franck, 1864). Not the least profitable chapters in this book are\r\nthose devoted to the preparation of manure in composts, to be ripened\r\nin pits as Varro advises in the text. They show a thoroughness, a care\r\nand an art in the mixing of the various animal dungs, with straw,\r\nwoodsearth and cinders, which few modern gardeners could equal. German\r\nscholarship has questioned the Chaldaean origin of the authorities\r\nquoted, but there is internal evidence which smacks of an oriental\r\ndespotism that might well be Babylonian. In a recipe for a rich\r\ncompost suitable for small garden plants, we are advised (I, 2, I, p.\r\n95), without a quiver, to mix in blood--that of the camel or the sheep\r\nif necessary--_but human blood is to be preferred!_]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: What Varro describes as the military fence of ditch and\r\nbank was doubtless the typical Herefordshire fence of modern England\r\nwhich Arthur Young, in _The Farmers' Letters_, recommends so highly as\r\nat once most effective and most economical. The bank is topped with a\r\nplashed hedge of white thorn in which sallow, ash, hazel and beech are\r\nplanted for \"firing.\" The fencing practice of the American farmer has\r\nfollowed the line of least resistance and is founded on the lowest\r\nfirst cost: the original \"snake\" fences of split rails, upon the\r\nmaking of which a former generation of pioneer American boys qualified\r\nthemselves for Presidential campaigns, being followed by woven wire\r\n\"made by a trust\" and not the most enduring achievement of Big\r\nBusiness. The practical farmer, as well as the lover of rural scenery,\r\nhas cause for regret that American agricultural practice has not yet\r\nhad the patience to enclose the land within live hedges and ditches.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 71: The kind of fence which Varro here describes as \"ex terra\r\net lapillis compositis in formis\" is also described by Pliny (H.N.\r\nXXXV, 169), as formaceos or moulded, and he adds, \"aevis durant.\" It\r\nwould thus clearly appear to have been of gravel concrete, the use of\r\nwhich the manufacturers of cement are now telling us, is the badge of\r\nthe modern progressive farmer. Cato (XXXVIII) told how to burn lime on\r\nthe farm, and these concrete fences were, of course, formed with lime\r\nas the matrix. When only a few years ago, Portland cement was first\r\nproduced in America at a cost and in a quantity to stimulate the\r\ndevelopment of concrete construction, engineers began with rough\r\nbroken stone and sand as the constituents of what they call the\r\naggregate, but some one soon \"discovered\" that the use of smooth\r\nnatural gravel made more compact concrete and \"gravel concrete\" became\r\nthe last word in engineering practice. But it was older even than\r\nVarro. A Chicago business man visiting Mycenae picked up and brought\r\nhome a bit of rubbish from Schliemann's excavations of the ancient\r\nmasonry: lying on his office desk it attracted the attention of an\r\nengineering friend who exclaimed, \"That is one of the best samples of\r\nthe new gravel concrete I have seen. Did it come out of the Illinois\r\ntunnel?\" \"No,\" replied the returned traveller, \"it came out of the\r\ntomb of Agamemnon!\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 72: Varro here seems to forget the unities. He speaks in his\r\nown person, when Scrofa has the floor.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 73: It will be recalled that Aristotle described slaves as\r\nliving tools. In Roman law a slave was not a _persona_ but a _res_.\r\nCf. Gaius II, 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 74: One of the most interesting of these freemen labourers of\r\nwhom we know is that Ofellus whom Horace (Satire II, 2) tells us\r\nwas working with cheerful philosophy as a hired hand upon his\r\nown ancestral property from which he had been turned out in the\r\nconfiscations following the battle of Philippi. This might have been\r\nthe fate of Virgil also had he not chanced to have powerful friends.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: \"Mais lorsque, malgré le dégoût de la chaîne domestique,\r\nnous voyons naître entre les males et les femelles ces sentiments\r\nque la nature a partout fondés sur un libre choix: lorsque l'amour a\r\ncommencé a unir ces couples captifs, alors leur esclavage, devenu pour\r\neux aussi doux que la douce liberté, leur fait oublier peu à peu\r\nleur droits de franchise naturelle et les prérogatives de leur état\r\nsauvage; et ces lieux des premiers plaisirs, des premières amours,\r\nces lieux si chers à tout être sensible, deviennent leur demeure de\r\nprédilection et leur habitation de choix: l'éducation de la famille\r\nrend encore cette affection plus profonde et la communique en même\r\ntemps aux petits, qui s'étant trouvés citoyens par naissance d'un\r\nséjour adopté par leur parents, ne cherchent point à en changer: car\r\nne pouvant avoir que pen ou point d'idée d'un état different ni d'un\r\nautre séjour ils s'attachent au lieu ou ils sont nés comme à leur\r\npatrie; et l'on sait que la terre natale est chère a ceux même qui\r\nl'habitent en esclaves.\"\r\n\r\nOne might assume that this eloquent and comfortable essay on\r\ncontentment in slavery had been written to illustrate Varro's text\r\nat this point, but, as a matter of fact, it is Buffon's observation\r\n(VIII, 460) on the domestication of wild ducks!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: Saserna's rule would be the equivalent of one hand to\r\nevery five acres cultivated. With slave labour, certainly with negro\r\nslave labour, the experience of American cotton planters in the\r\nnineteenth century very nearly confirmed this requirement, but one of\r\nthe economic advantages of the abolition of slavery is illustrated by\r\nthis very point. In Latimer's _First Sermon before King Edward VI_,\r\nanimadverting on the advance in farm rents in his day, he says that\r\nhis father, a typical substantial English yeoman of the time of the\r\ndiscovery of America, was able to employ profitably six labourers in\r\ncultivating 120 acres, or, say, one hand for each twenty acres, which\r\nwas precisely what Arthur Young recommended as necessary for high\r\nfarming at the end of the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the\r\ntwentieth century the American farmer seldom employs more than one\r\nhand for every eighty acres cultivated, but this is partly due to the\r\nuse of improved machinery and partly to the fact that his land is not\r\nthoroughly cultivated.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: This example of Roman cost accounting is matched by\r\nWalter of Henley in thirteenth century England.\r\n\r\n\"Some men will tell you that a plough cannot work eight score or nine\r\nscore acres yearly, but I will show you that it can. You know well\r\nthat a furlong ought to be forty perches long and four wide, and the\r\nKing's perch is sixteen feet and a half: then an acre is sixty-six\r\nfeet in width. Now in ploughing go thirty-six times round to make\r\nthe ridge narrower, and when the acre is ploughed then you have made\r\nseventy-two furlongs, which are six leagues, for be it known that\r\ntwelve furlongs are a league. And the horse or ox must be very poor\r\nthat cannot from the morning go easily in pace three leagues in length\r\nfrom his starting place and return by three o'clock. And I will show\r\nyou by another reason that it can do as much. You know that there are\r\nin the year fifty-two weeks. Now take away eight weeks for holy days\r\nand other hindrances, then are there forty-four working weeks left.\r\nAnd in all that time the plough shall only have to plough for fallow\r\nor for spring or winter sowing three roods and a half daily, and for\r\nsecond fallowing an acre. Now see if a plough were properly kept and\r\nfollowed, if it could not do as much daily.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: Stolo is quibbling. Cato's unit of 240 jugera was based\r\non the duodecimal system of weights and measures which the Romans had\r\noriginally derived from Babylon but afterwards modified by the use\r\nof a decimal system. The enlightened and progressive nations of the\r\nmodern world who have followed the Romans in adopting a decimal system\r\nmay perhaps approve Stolo's remarks, but it behooves those of us who\r\nstill cling to the duodecimal system to defend Cato, if only to keep\r\nup our own courage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Here, in a few words, is the whole doctrine of\r\nintelligent agriculture. Cf. Donaldson's _Agricultural Biography,\r\ntit_. Jethro Tull. \"The name of Tull will ever descend to posterity as\r\none of the greatest luminaries, if not the very greatest benefactor,\r\nthat British agriculture has the pride to acknowledge. His example\r\nfurnishes the vast advantages of educated men directing their\r\nattention to the cultivation of the soil, as they bring enlightened\r\nminds to bear upon its practice and look at the object in a naked\r\npoint of view, being divested of the dogmas and trammels of the craft\r\nwith which the practitioners of routine are inexpugnably provided and\r\nentrenched.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: Pliny quotes Cato: \"What ever can be done by the help\r\nof the ass costs the least money,\" which is the philosophy of modern\r\npower machinery on the farm, as elsewhere. It is largely a question of\r\nthe cost of fuel, as Varro says.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Green manuring is one of the oldest, as it is one of\r\nthe best, of agricultural practices. Long before Varro, Theophrastus\r\n(II.P. 9, I) had recorded what the agricultural colleges teach\r\ntoday--that beans are valuable for this purpose because they rot\r\nreadily, and, he adds, in Macedonia and Thessaly it has always been\r\nthe custom to turn them under when they bloom.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Although Varro advises the first ploughing in the spring,\r\nthe ancients were not unmindful of the advantages of winter ploughing\r\nof stiff and heavy clay. Theophrastus, who died in B.C. 287, advises\r\nit \"that the earth may feel the cold.\" Indeed, he was fully alive to\r\nthe reasons urged by the modern professors of agronomy for intensive\r\ncultivation. \"For the soil,\" he says (C.P. III, 25), \"often inverted\r\nbecomes free, light and clear of weeds, so that it can most easily\r\nafford nourishment.\"\r\n\r\nKing Solomon gives the same advice, \"The sluggard will not plough\r\nby reason of the winter, therefore shall he begin harvest and have\r\nnothing.\" _Proverbs_, XX, 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: The Romans understood the advantages of thorough\r\ncultivation of the soil. As appears from the text, they habitually\r\nbroke up a sod in the spring, ploughed it again at midsummer, and once\r\nmore in September before seeding. Pliny prescribes that the first\r\nploughing should be nine inches deep, and says that the Etruscans some\r\ntimes ploughed their stiff clay as many as nine times. The accepted\r\nRoman reason for this was the eradication of weeds, but it also\r\naccomplished in some measure the purpose of \"dry farming\"--the\r\nconservation of the moisture content of the soil, as that had\r\nbeen practised for countless generations in the sandy Valley of\r\nMesopotamia. Varro makes no exception to this rule, but Virgil was\r\nhere, as in other instances, induced to depart from Varro's wisdom,\r\nwith the result that he imposed upon Roman agriculture several\r\nthoroughly bad practices. Thus, while he applies Varro ploughing rules\r\nto rich land and bids the farmer \"exercetque frequens tellurem atque\r\nimperat arvis,\" he says (Geo. I, 62) that it will suffice to give\r\nsandy land a single shallow ploughing in September immediately before\r\nseeding, for fear, forsooth, that the summer suns will evaporate\r\nwhatever moisture there is in it! Again, Virgil recommends, what Varro\r\ndoes not, cross-ploughing and burning the stubble and Virgil's advice\r\nwas generally followed.\r\n\r\nIn William Benson's edition (1725) of the _Georgics_ \"with notes\r\ncritical and rustick,\" it is stated that \"the husbandry of England\r\nin general is Virgilian, which is shown by paring and burning the\r\nsurface: by raftering and cross-ploughing, and that in those parts of\r\nEngland where the Romans principally inhabited all along the Southern\r\ncoast Latin words remain to this hour among shepherds and ploughmen in\r\ntheir rustick affairs: and what will seem more strange at first sight\r\nto affirm though in fact really true, there is more of Virgil's\r\nhusbandry put in practice in England at this instant than in Italy\r\nitself.\" That this was the fact in the thirteenth century is clear\r\nfrom the quotations we have made from Walter of Henley's _Dite de\r\nHosebondrie_. Cf. also Sir Anthony Fitzherbert and the account of the\r\nmanorial system of farming in England in Prothero's _English Farming\r\nPast and Present_.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Jethro Tull of the _Horseshoeing Husbandry_ to unloose\r\nin England the long spell of the magic of Virgil's poetry upon\r\npractical agriculture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: The Julian calendar, which took effect on January 1, B.C.\r\n45, had been in use only eight years when Varro was writing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Schneider and others have attempted to emend the\r\nenumeration of the days in this succession of seasons, but Keil\r\njustly observes: \"As we do not know what principle Varro followed in\r\nestablishing these divisions of the year, it is safer to set them\r\ndown as they are written in the codex than to be tempted by uncertain\r\nemendation.\" I have accordingly followed Keil here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: The practice of ridging land seeded to grain was\r\nnecessary before the invention of the modern drill. Dickson, in his\r\n_Husbandry of the Ancients_, XXIV, argues that, while wasteful of\r\nland, it had the advantage of preventing the grain from lodging.\r\nWalter of Henley, who followed the Roman methods by tradition without\r\nknowing it, advises with them that to be successful in this kind of\r\nseeding the furrow at the last ploughing of the fallow should be so\r\nnarrow as to be indistinguishable. \"At sowing do not plough large\r\nfurrows,\" he says, \"but little and well laid together that the seed\r\nmay fall evenly: if you plough a large furrow to be quick you will do\r\nharm. How? I will tell you. When, the ground is sown then the harrow\r\nwill come and pull the corn into the hollow which is between the two\r\nridges and the large ridge shall be uncovered, then no corn shall grow\r\nthere. And will you see this? When the corn is above ground go to the\r\nend of the ridge and you will see that I tell you truly. And if the\r\nland must be sown below the ridge see that it is ploughed with small\r\nfurrows and the earth raised as much as you are able. And see that the\r\nridge which is between the two furrows is narrow. And let the earth,\r\nwhich lies like a crest in the furrow under the left foot after the\r\nplough, be over-turned, and then shall the furrow be narrow enough.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Farrago was a mixture of refuse _far_, or spelt, with\r\nvetch, sown thick and cut green to be fed to cattle in the process\r\nnow called soiling.

The rural confidence in the influence of the moon upon\r\nthe life of a farm still persists vigorously: thus as Pliny (H.N.\r\nXVIII, 75) counselled that one wean a colt only when the moon is on\r\nthe wane, so it will be found that the moon is consulted before a colt\r\nis weaned on most American farms today: for that may be safely done,\r\nsays the rural oracle, only when the moon's sign, as given in the\r\nalmanack, corresponds with a part of the almanack's \"moon's man\" or\r\n\"anatomic\" at or below the knees, i.e., when the moon is in one or the\r\nother of the signs Pisces, Capricornus or Aquarius: but never at a\r\ntime of day when the moon is in its \"Southing.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Modern agricultural chemistry has contradicted this\r\njudgment of Cassius, for the manure of sea birds, especially that\r\nbrought from the South American islands in the Pacific, known\r\ncommercially as Peruvian guano, is found on analysis to be high in the\r\nelements which are most beneficial to plant life.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: Seed selection, which is now preached so earnestly by\r\nthe Agricultural Department of the United States as one of the things\r\nnecessary to increase the yield of wheat and corn, has ever been good\r\npractice. Following Varro Virgil (_Georgic_ I, 197) insists upon it:\r\n\"I have seen those seeds on whose selection much time and labour\r\nhad been spent, nevertheless degenerate if men did not every year\r\nrigorously separate by hand all the largest specimens.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: Cicero (de Div. II, 24) records a _mot_ of Cato's that\r\nhe wondered that an haruspex did not laugh when he saw another--\"qui\r\nmirari se aiebat, quod non rideret aruspex, aruspicem quum vidisset.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: This process of propagation which Varro describes as\r\n\"new\" is still practised by curious orchardists under the name\r\n\"inarching.\" The free end of a growing twig is introduced into a\r\nlimb of its own tree, back of a specimen fruit, thus pushing its\r\ndevelopment by means of the supplemental feeding so provided. Cf. Cyc.\r\nAm. Hort. II, 664.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: _Alfalfa_ is the Moorish name which the Spaniards brought\r\nto America with the forage plant _Medicago Sativa_, Linn., which all\r\nover Southern Europe is known by the French name _lucerne_. It is\r\nproper to honour the Moors by continuing in use their name for this\r\ninteresting plant, because undoubtedly they preserved it for the use\r\nof the modern world, just as undoubtedly they bequeathed to us that\r\nfine sentiment known as personal honour.\r\n\r\nAlfalfa was one of the standbys of ancient agriculture. According to\r\nPliny, it was introduced into Italy from Greece, whence it had been\r\nbrought from Asia during the Persian wars, and so derived its Greek\r\nand Roman name _Medica_. As Cato does not mention it with the other\r\nlegumes he used, it is probable that the Romans had not yet adopted\r\nit in Cato's day, but by the time of Varro and Virgil it was well\r\nestablished in Italy. In Columella's day it was already a feature of\r\nthe agriculture of Andalousia, and there the Moors, who loved plants,\r\nkept it alive, as it were a Vestal fire, while it died out of Italy\r\nduring the Dark Ages: from Spain it spread again all over Southern\r\nEurope, and with America it was a fair exchange for tobacco. Alfalfa\r\nhas always been the subject of high praise wherever it has been known.\r\nThe Greek Amphilochus devoted a whole book to it, as have the English\r\nWalter Harte in the middle of the eighteenth century and the American\r\nCoburn at the beginning of the twentieth century, but none of them is\r\nmore instructive on the subject of its culture than is Columella in a\r\nfew paragraphs. Because of the difficulty of getting a stand of it in\r\nmany soils, it is important to realize the pains which the Romans took\r\nwith the seed bed, for it is on this point that most American farmers\r\nfail. Says Columella (II, 10):\r\n\r\n\"But of all the legumes, alfalfa is the best, because, when once it is\r\nsown, it lasts ten years: because it can be mowed four times, and even\r\nsix times, a year: because it improves the soil: because all lean\r\ncattle grow fat by feeding upon it: because it is a remedy for sick\r\nbeasts: because a jugerum (two-thirds of an acre) of it will feed\r\nthree horses plentifully for a year. We will teach you the manner of\r\ncultivating it, as follows: The land which you wish to set in alfalfa\r\nthe following spring should be broken up about the Kalends of October,\r\nso that it may mellow through the entire winter. About the Kalends of\r\nFebruary harrow it thoroughly, remove all the stones and break up the\r\nclods. Later, about the month of March, harrow it for the third time.\r\nWhen you have so got the land in good order, lay it off after the\r\nmanner of a garden, in beds ten feet wide and fifty feet long, so that\r\nit may be possible to let in water by the paths, and access on every\r\nside may be had by the weeders. Then cover the beds with well rotted\r\nmanure. At last, about the end of April, sow plentifully so that a\r\nsingle measure (cyanthus) of seed will cover a space ten feet long\r\nand five wide. When you have done this brush in the seed with wooden\r\nrakes: this is most important for otherwise the sprouts will be\r\nwithered by the sun. After the sowing no iron tool should touch the\r\nbeds; but, as I have said, they should be cultivated with wooden\r\nrakes, and in the same manner they should be weeded so that no foreign\r\ngrass can choke out the young alfalfa. The first cutting should be\r\nlate, when the seed begins to fall: afterwards, when it is well\r\nrooted, you can cut it as young as you wish to feed to the stock. Feed\r\nit at first sparingly, until the stock becomes accustomed to it, for\r\nit causes bloat and excess of blood. After cutting, irrigate the beds\r\nfrequently, and after a few days, when the roots begin to sprout, weed\r\nout all other kinds of grass. Cultivated in this way alfalfa can be\r\nmowed six times a year, and it will last for ten years.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: See the explanation of what the Romans meant by _terra\r\nvaria_ in the note on Cato V. _ante_, p. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: It is interesting to note from the statements in the text\r\nthat in Varro's time the Roman farmer in Italy both sowed and reaped\r\nsubstantially the same amount of wheat as does the American farmer\r\ntoday. Varro says that the Romans sowed five modii of wheat to the\r\njugerum and reaped on the maximum fifteen for one. As the modius was\r\nnearly the equivalent of our peck, the Roman allowance for sowing\r\ncorresponds to the present American practice of sowing seven pecks\r\nof wheat to the acre: and on this basis a yield of 26 bushels to the\r\nacre, which is not uncommon in the United States, is the equivalent of\r\nthe Roman harvest of fifteen for one.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to the average Italian farmer of the present day who is\r\nheld up by the economists to scorn because he does not produce\r\nmore than eleven bushels of wheat to the acre, to record that in\r\nColumella's time, when agriculture had declined as compared with\r\nVarro's experience, the average yield of grain in many parts of Italy\r\ndid not exceed four for one (_Columella_, III, 3), or say seven and a\r\nhalf bushels to the acre.\r\n\r\nVarro's statement that at Byzacium in Africa wheat yielded 100 for\r\none, which Pliny (_II.N._ XVIII, 23) increases to 150 for one, means\r\nfrom 175 to 260 bushels per acre, seems incredible to us, but is\r\nconfirmed by the testimony of agricultural practice in Palestine.\r\nIsaac claimed to reap an hundred fold, and the parable of the Sower\r\nalludes to yields of 30, 60 and 100 fold.\r\n\r\nHarte _Essays on Husbandry_, 91, says that the average yield in\r\nEngland in the middle of the eighteenth century was seven for one,\r\nthough he records the case of an award by the Dublin Society in 1763\r\nto an Irish gentleman who raised 50 bushels of wheat from a single\r\npeck of seed! Harte was a parson, but apparently he did not bring the\r\nsame unction into his agriculture as did the Rev. Robert Herrick to\r\nthe husbandry of his Devonshire glebe, a century earlier. In Herrick's\r\n_Thanksgiving to God for his House_ he sings:\r\n\r\n  \"Lord, 'tis thy plenty dropping hand\r\n    That soils my land\r\n  And giv'st me for my bushel sown\r\n    Twice ten for one.\r\n  Thou makst my teeming hen to lay\r\n    Her egg each day:\r\n  Besides my healthful ewes to bear\r\n    Me twins each year.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: As the Gallic header here described by Varro is the\r\ndirect ancestor of our modern marvellous self-binding harvester, it is\r\nof interest to rehearse the other ancient references to it.\r\n\r\nPliny (_H. N_. XVIII, 72) says:\r\n\r\n\"In the vast domains of the provinces of Gaul a large hollow frame\r\narmed with teeth and supported on two wheels is driven through the\r\nstanding corn, the beasts being yoked behind it, the result being that\r\nthe ears are torn off and fall within the frame.\" Palladius (VII, 2)\r\ngoes more into detail:\r\n\r\n\"The people of the more level regions of Gaul have devised a method of\r\nharvesting quickly and with a minimum of human labour, for thereby a\r\nsingle ox is made to bear the burden of the entire harvest. A cart is\r\nconstructed on two low wheels and is furnished with a square body, of\r\nwhich the side boards are adjusted to slope upward and outward to make\r\ngreater capacity. The front of the body is left open and there across\r\nthe width of the cart are set a series of lance shaped teeth spaced to\r\nthe distance between the grain stalks and curved upward. Behind the\r\ncart two short shafts are fashioned, like those of a litter, where the\r\nox is yoked and harnessed with his head towards the cart: for this\r\npurpose it is well to use a well broken and sensible ox, which will\r\nnot push ahead of his driver. When this machine is driven through the\r\nstanding grain all the heads are stripped by the teeth and are thrown\r\nback and collected in the body of the cart, the straw being left\r\nstanding. The machine is so contrived that the driver can adjust its\r\nheight to that of the grain. Thus with little going and coming and in\r\na few short hours the entire harvest is made. This method is available\r\nin level or prairie countries and to those who do not need to save the\r\nstraw.\"\r\n\r\nThat ingenious Dutchman Conrad Heresbach refers, in his _Husbandry_,\r\nto Palladius' description of the Gallic header with small respect,\r\nwhich indicates that in the sixteenth century it was no longer in use.\r\nI quote from Barnaby Googe's translation of Heresbach (the book which\r\nserved Izaak Walton as the model for his _Compleat Angler_): \"This\r\ntricke might be used in levell and champion countries, but with us it\r\nwould make but ill-favoured worke.\"\r\n\r\nDondlinger, in his excellent _Book of Wheat_ (1908), which should be\r\nin the hands of every grain farmer, gives a picture reproducing the\r\nGallic header and says:\r\n\r\n\"After being used during hundreds of years the Gallic header\r\ndisappeared, and it seems to have been completely forgotten for\r\nseveral centuries. Only through literature did it escape the fate of\r\npermanent oblivion and become a heritage for the modern world. The\r\npublished description of the machine by Pliny and Palladius furnished\r\nthe impulse in which modern harvesting inventions originated. Its\r\ndistinctive features are retained in several modern inventions of this\r\nclass, machines which have a practical use and value under conditions\r\nsimilar to those which existed on the plains of Gaul. Toward the close\r\nof the eighteenth century, the social, economic and agricultural\r\nconditions in England, on account of increasing competition and the\r\nhigher value of labour, were ripe for the movement of invention that\r\nwas heralded by the printed account of the Gallic header. The first\r\nheader was constructed by William Pitt in 1786. It was an attempted\r\nimprovement on the ancient machine in that the stripping teeth were\r\nplaced in a cylinder which was revolved by power transmitted from the\r\nwheels. This 'rippling cylinder' carried the heads of the wheat into\r\nthe box of the machine, and gradually evolved into the present day\r\nreel.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the William Pitt mentioned was not the statesman,\r\nbut a contemporary agricultural writer of the same name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: According to Sir Anthony Fitzherbert it was the custom in\r\nEngland to shear wheat and rye and to leave the straw standing after\r\nthe third method described by Varro, the purpose being to preserve the\r\nstraw to be cut later for thatching, as threshing it would necessarily\r\ndestroy its value for thatching. It was the custom in England,\r\nhowever, to mow barley and oats.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: Pliny advises that the grain which collects on the\r\ncircumference of a threshing floor of this description be saved for\r\nseed because it is evidently the heaviest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: In the Apennines today the threshing floor, or _aja_, is\r\nanointed with cow dung smeared smooth with water, doubtless for the\r\nsame reason that the Romans so used amurca.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: Between harvests the winnowing basket is quite generally\r\nused in Italy today for a cradle, as it was from the beginning of\r\ntime, for there is an ancient gem representing the infant Bacchus\r\nasleep in a winnowing basket.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: What the French call, from the same practice, _vin de\r\nrognure_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: Varro does not mention the season of the olive harvest,\r\nbut Virgil tells us (G. II, 519) that in their day as now it was\r\nwinter. Cato (XX-XXII) described the construction and operation of the\r\n_trapetus_ in detail. 'It can still be seen in operation in Italy,\r\nturned by a patient donkey and flowing with the new oil of an intense\r\nblue-green colour. It is always flanked by an array of vast storage\r\njars (Cato's _dolii_ now called _orci_), which make one realize the\r\nstory of _Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: The Roman waste of amurca, through ignorance of its\r\nvalue, was like the American waste of the cotton seed, which for many\r\nyears was thrown out from the gin to rot upon the ground, even its\r\nfertilizing use being neglected. Now cotton seed has a market value\r\nequivalent to nearly 20 per cent of that of the staple. It is used for\r\ncattle feed and also is made into lard and \"pure olive oil,\" being\r\nexported in bulk and imported again in bottles with Italian labels.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: Cf. Fowler, _Social Life at Rome in the Age of Cicero_.\r\n\"Let us consider that in a large city today the person and property\r\nof all, rich or poor, are adequately protected by a sound system of\r\npolice and by courts of first instance which are sitting every day.\r\nAssault and murder, theft and burglary are exceptional. It might be\r\ngoing too far to say that at Rome they were the rule: but it is the\r\nfact that in what we may call the slums of Rome there was no machinery\r\nfor checking them.... It is the great merit of Augustus that he made\r\nRome not only a city of marble but one in which the persons and\r\nproperty of all citizens were fairly secure.\"\r\n\r\nThere are several contemporary references to the crowded and dangerous\r\ncondition of the streets of Rome at the end of the Republic. Cicero\r\n(_Plancius_, 7) tells how he was pushed against the arch of Fabius\r\nwhile struggling through the press of the Via Sacra, and exonerates\r\nfrom blame the man who was the immediate cause of his inconvenience,\r\nholding that the one next beyond was more responsible: in which\r\njudgment Cicero was of the opinion of Mr. Justice Blackstone in the\r\nfamous leading case of Scott _v_. Shepherd (1 _Smith's L.C._, 480),\r\nwhere the question was who was liable for the damage eventually done\r\nby the burning squib which was passed about the market house by\r\nsuccessive hands. The majority of the court held, however, against\r\nBlackstone and Cicero, and established the doctrine of proximate\r\ncause.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: The Roman week (_nundinum_, or more properly _inter\r\nnundinum_) was of eight days, the last being the market day on which\r\nthe citizens rested from agricultural labour and came into town to\r\nsell and buy and talk politics. Cf. Pliny, XVIII, 3. This custom which\r\nVarro regrets had fallen into desuetude so far as Rome was concerned\r\nwas in his day still practised in the provinces. Thus the five tenants\r\non Horace's Sabine farm were wont to go every _nundinum_ to the market\r\ntown of Varia (the modern Vicovaro) to transact public business\r\n(_Epist_. I, 14, 2).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: Varro here refers to the great economic change which was\r\ncoming over Italian husbandry in the last days of the Republic, the\r\ndisappearance of the small farms, the \"septem jugera\" which nurtured\r\nthe early Roman heroes like Cincinnatus and Dentatus, and even the\r\nlarger, but still comparatively small, farms which Cato describes, and\r\nthe development of the _latifundia_ given over to grazing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: The tradition is, says Pliny, that King Augeas was the\r\nfirst in Greece to use manure, and that Hercules introduced the\r\npractice into Italy. To the wise farmer the myth of the Augean stables\r\nis the genesis of good agriculture.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: This was the \"crowded hour\" in Varro's life, and, as M.\r\nBoissier has pointed out, he loved to dwell upon its episodes. It\r\nwill be recalled that Pompey divided the Mediterranean into thirteen\r\ndistricts for the war with the Pirates and put a responsible\r\nlieutenant in command of each, thus enabling him by concurrent action\r\nin all the districts to clear the seas in three months. Appian gives\r\nthe list of officers and the limits of their commands, saying: \"The\r\ncoasts of Sicily and the Ionian sea as far as Acarnania were entrusted\r\nto Plotius and Varro.\" It is difficult to understand Varro's own\r\nreference to Delos, but Appian makes clear how it happened that Varro\r\nwas stationed on the coast of Epirus and so fell in with the company\r\nof \"half Greek shepherds\" who are the _dramatis personae_ of the\r\nsecond book. As the scene of the first book was laid in a temple of\r\nTellus, so this relating to live stock is cast in a temple of Pales,\r\nthe goddess of shepherds, on the occasion of the festival of the\r\nParilia, and the names of the characters have a punning reference to\r\nlive stock.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: The codices here contain an interpolation of the words\r\n\"HIC INTERMISIMUS,\" to indicate that a part of the text is missing,\r\nwith which judgment of some early student of the archetype Victorius,\r\nScaliger and Ursinus, as well as their successors among the\r\ncommentators on Varro, have all agreed. It is a pleasure to record the\r\nagreement on this point, because it is believed to be unique: but\r\nmany precedents for plunging the reader _in medias res_, as does the\r\nsurviving text, might be found in the modern short story of the\r\nartist in style. As M. Boissier points out Varro might have cited the\r\nbeginning of the Odyssey as a precedent for this.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: This is a paraphase of a favorite locution of Homer's\r\nheroes, whose characteristic modesty does not, however, permit them\r\nto apply it to themselves, as Varro does. Thus in _Iliad_, VII, 114,\r\nAgamemnon advises Menelaos not to venture against Hector, whom \"even\r\nAchilles dreadeth to meet in battle, wherein is the warrior's glory,\r\nand Achilles is better far than thou.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Virgil (Aen. VII, 314) made a fine line out of this\r\ntradition, endowing the sturdy race of Fauns and Nymphs who inhabited\r\nthe land of Saturn before the Golden Age, with the qualities of the\r\ntrees on whose fruit they subsisted, \"gensque virum truncis et duro\r\nrobore nata.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: In the registers of the censors every thing from which\r\nthe public revenues were derived was set down under the head of\r\n_pascua_, or \"pasture lands,\" because for a long time the pasture\r\nlands were the only source of such revenue. Cf. Pliny, _H.N._ XVIII,\r\n3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Olisippo is the modern Lisbon. This tradition about the\r\nmares of the region is repeated by Virgil (Geo. III, 272) by Columella\r\n(VI, 27) and by Pliny (VIII, 67). Professor Ridgeway in _The Origin\r\nand Influence of the Thoroughbred Horse_ describes it as \"an\r\naetiological myth to explain the swiftness of horses\" for the fleetest\r\nhorses came out of the West; thus Pegasus was born at the springs of\r\nthe ocean, and there is the passage in Homer (_Iliad_, XVI, 149) about\r\nthe horses \"that flew as swift as the winds, the horses that the\r\nharpy Podarge (Swift Foot) bare to the West Wind as she grazed on the\r\nmeadows by the stream of the Ocean.\" Hence we may conclude that there\r\nwas a race of swift horses in Portugal in the earliest times, which\r\nProfessor Ridgeway would doubtless like very much to prove, in support\r\nof his interesting thesis, were derived from Libya.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: _Hypenemia_, or barren eggs, are described intelligently\r\nby Aristotle (H.A.V. 1, 4, VI. 2, 5), and, with Varro's confidence in\r\nthe country traditions, by Pliny, H.N. X, 80.\r\n\r\nIf he had known it, Varro might have here cited the fact that the\r\nunfertilized queen bee is parthenogenetic, though producing only male\r\nbees; i.e., drones: but it remained for a German clergyman, Dzierzon,\r\nto discover this in the eighteenth century.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Cf. Plautus _Menaechmi_, II, 2, 279. One of the two\r\nMenaechmi is, on his arrival at Epidamnus, mistaken for his brother,\r\nof whose existence he does not know, and much to his amazement is\r\nintroduced into the brother's life and possessions. At first he\r\nexpostulates, accusing the slave of the brother, who has mistaken his\r\nidentity, of being crazy and offers to exorcise him by a sacrifice\r\nof weanling pigs, wherefore he asks the question quoted in the text.\r\nVarro was evidently fond of this passage, as he quotes it again,\r\n_post_, p. 221. The _Menaechmi_ is one of the immortal comedies and\r\nhas survived in many forms on the modern stage all over Europe. From\r\nit Shakespeare derived the plot of the _Comedy of Errors_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: It is interesting to compare these sane therapeutics with\r\nCato's practice less than two hundred years previous (_ante_, p. 47),\r\nwhich was characteristic of the superstitious peasant who in Italy\r\nstill seeks the priest to bless his ailing live stock.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: This Atticus was Cicero's intimate friend to whom he\r\naddressed so many of his charming letters. He changed his name as\r\nstated in the text, the new name being that of an uncle who adopted\r\nhim, as we learn from his life by Nepos. As is well known to all\r\nstudents of Cicero, Atticus had dwelt in Athens many years and derived\r\nhis income from estates in Epirus, which is the point of Scrofa's\r\njest.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: This requirement of short legs is the more remarkable\r\nbecause of the long journeys which Varro says the Roman sheep were\r\nrequired to make between their summer and winter pastures. A similar\r\nnecessity and bad roads created in England, before the eighteenth\r\ncentury, a demand for long legged sheep. Prothero (_English Farming\r\nPast and Present_) quotes a description of the \"true old Warwickshire\r\nram\" in 1789: \"His frame large and remarkably loose. His bone\r\nthroughout heavy. His legs long and thick, terminating in large splaw\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the things which Bakewell accomplished was to shorten the legs\r\nas well as to increase the mutton on his New Leicesters. Of Bakewell,\r\nMr. Prothero justly says, \"By providing meat for the million he\r\ncontributed as much to the wealth of the country as Arkwright or\r\nWatt.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Shepherds still look for the black or spotted tongue in\r\nthe mouth of the ram, for the reason given by Varro, but the warning\r\nis no longer put in the shepherds' manual.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: Varro would still feel at home in Apulia, for there the\r\nsheep industry is carried on much as it was in his time, and thence\r\nthe _calles publicae_, to which he refers, still lead to the summer\r\npastures in the Apennines. Cf. Beauclerk _Rural Italy_, chap. V. \"The\r\nextensive pasturages of the 'Tavoliere di Puglia' (Apulia) are of\r\ngreat importance and have a history of their own. This vast domain\r\ncovers 750,000 acres: its origin belongs to the time of the Roman\r\nConquests and the protracted wars of the Republic, which were fought\r\nout in the plains, whence they became deserted and uncultivated, fit\r\nonly for public pastures in winter time ... the periodical emigrations\r\nof the flocks continue as in the past times: they descend from the\r\nmountains into the plains by a network of wide grassy roads which\r\ntraverse the region in every direction and are called _tratturi_.\r\nThese lanes are over 100 yards in width and cover a total length\r\nof 940 miles.... Not less than 50,000 animals are pastured on the\r\nTavoliere, requiring over 1,500 square miles of land for their\r\nsubsistence.... Five thousand persons are employed as shepherds.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: Varro quite uniformly uses words which indicate that he\r\nwas accustomed to see sheep driven (_abigere, propellere, adpellere_)\r\nbut we can see the flocks _led_ in Italy today, as they were in\r\nPalestine soon after Varro's death, according to the testimony of that\r\nbeautiful figure of the Good Shepherd (_St. John_, X, 4): \"And when he\r\nputteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them, and the sheep follow\r\nhim, for they know his voice.\" R. Child, in his \"Large Letter\" in\r\nHartlib's _Legacie_, gives the explanation of the difference in the\r\ncustom:\r\n\r\n\"Our sheep do not follow their shepherds as they do in all other\r\ncountries: for the shepherd goeth before and the sheep follow like a\r\npack of dogs. This disobedience of our sheep doth not happen to us,\r\nas the Papist Priests tell their simple flocks, because we have left\r\ntheir great shepherd the Pope; but because we let our sheep range\r\nnight and day in our fields without a shepherd: which other countries\r\ndare not for fear of wolves and other ravenous beasts, but are\r\ncompelled to guard them all day with great dogs and to bring them home\r\nat night, or to watch them in their folds.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Cf. Dante, _Purg_. XXVII, 79.\r\n\r\n      \"Le capre\r\n  Tacite all' ombra mentre che'l sol ferve\r\n  Guardate dal pastor che'n su la verga\r\n  Poggiato s'e, e lor poggiato serve.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: It will be recalled that when Odysseus, disguised as a\r\nbeggar, was making his way to his house in company with the faithful\r\nswineherd Eumaeus, they met the goatherd Melanthius \"leading his goats\r\nto feast the wooers, the best goats that were in all the herds.\"\r\n(_Odyssey_, XVII, 216), and that subsequently he suffered a terrible\r\npunishment for this unfaithfulness to his master's interests.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: Pliny (VIII, 76) calls these excrescences _lanciniae_, or\r\nfolds, and attributes them exclusively to the she goat, as Varro seems\r\nto do also, but Columella (VII, 6) attributes them to the buck.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: Aristotle (H.A. I, 9.1) refers to this opinion and\r\ndenounces it as erroneous.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: The Roman _denarius_, which has been here and later\r\ntranslated _denier_, may be considered for the purpose of comparing\r\nvalues as, roughly, the equivalent of the modern franc, or lira, say\r\n20 cents United States money.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Macrobius (_Saturn_. I, 6) tells another story of the\r\norigin of this cognomen, which, if not so heroic as that in the text,\r\nis entertaining. It is related that a neighbour's sow strayed on\r\nTremelius' land and was caught and killed as a vagrant. When the\r\nowner came to claim it and asserted the right to search the premises\r\nTremelius hid the carcass in the bed in which his wife was lying and\r\nthen took a solemn oath that there was no sow in his house except that\r\nin the bed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: It would seem, as Gibbon says of the Empress Theodora,\r\nthat this passage could be left \"veiled in the obscurity of a learned\r\nlanguage\"; but it may be noted that the _locus classicus_ for the\r\nplay on the word is the incident of the Megarian \"mystery pigs\" in\r\nAristophanes' _Acharnians_, 728 ff. Cf. also Athenaeus, IX, 17, 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Cf. Pliny (_H.N._ VIII, 77): \"There is no animal that\r\naffords a greater variety to the palate of the epicure: all the others\r\nhave their own peculiar flavour, but the flesh of the hog has nearly\r\nfifty different flavours.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: In his stimulating book, _Comment la route crée le type\r\nSocial_, Edmond Desmolins submits an ingenious hypothesis to explain\r\nthe pre-eminence of the Gauls in the growing and making of pork,\r\nand how that pre-eminence was itself the explanation of their early\r\nsuccess in cultivating the cereals. He describes their migrating\r\nancestors, the Celts, pushing their way up the Danube as hordes of\r\nnomad shepherds with their vast flocks and herds of horses and cattle,\r\non the milk of which they had hitherto subsisted. So long as they\r\njourneyed through prairie steppes, the last of which was Hungary, they\r\nmaintained their shepherd character, but when they once passed the\r\nsite of the present city of Vienna and entered the plateau of Bavaria,\r\nthey found new physical conditions which caused them to reduce and to\r\nseparate their herds of large cattle--an unbroken forest affording\r\nlittle pasture of grass. Here they found the wild boar subsisting upon\r\nthe mast of the forest, and him they domesticated out of an economic\r\nnecessity, to take the place of their larger cattle as a basis of food\r\nsupply. Until then they had not been meat eaters, and so had known no\r\nnecessity for cereals, for milk is a balanced ration in itself. But\r\nthis change of diet required them also to take to agriculture and so\r\nto abandon their nomad life.\r\n\r\n'By reason of the habits of the animal, swine husbandry has a tendency\r\nin itself to confine those engaged in it to a more or less sedentary\r\nlife, but we are about to see how the Celts were compelled to\r\naccomplish this important evolution by an even more powerful force.\r\nMeat cannot be eaten habitually except in conjunction with a\r\ncereal ... and of all the meats pork is the one which demands this\r\nassociation most insistently, because it is the least easily digested\r\nand the most heating of all the meats.... So that is how the adoption\r\nof swine husbandry and a diet of pork compelled our nomad Celts to\r\ntake the next step and settle down to agriculture.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: This Gallic _tomacina_ was doubtless the ancestor of the\r\n_mortadella_ now produced in the Emilia and known to English speaking\r\nconsumers as \"Bologna\" sausage.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: The Gaul of which Cato was here writing is the modern\r\nLombardy, one of the most densely populated and richest agricultural\r\ndistricts in the world. Here are found today those truly marvellous\r\n\"marchite\" or irrigated meadows which owe the initiative for their\r\nexistence to the Cistercian monks of the Chiaravalle Abbey, who began\r\ntheir fruitful agricultural labours in the country near Milan in the\r\ntwelfth century. There is a recorded instance of one of these meadows\r\nwhich yielded in a single season 140 tons of grass per hectare, equal\r\nto 75 tons of hay, or 30 tons per acre! The meadows are mowed six\r\ntimes a year, and the grass is fed green to Swiss cows, which are kept\r\nin great numbers for the manufacture of \"frommaggio di grana,\" or\r\nParmesan cheese. This system of green soiling maintains the fertility\r\nof the meadows, while the by-product of the dairies is the feeding of\r\nhogs, which are kept in such quantity that they are today exported as\r\nthey were in the times of Cato and Varro. There is no region of the\r\nearth, unless it be Flanders, of which the aspect so rejoices the\r\nheart of a farmer as the Milanese. Well may the Lombard proverb say,\r\n\"Chi ha prato, ha tutto.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Virgil (_Aen_. VII, 26) subsequently made good use of\r\nthis tradition of the founding of Lavinium, the sacred city of the\r\nRomans where the Penates dwelt and whither solemn processions were\r\nwont to proceed from Rome until Christianity became the State\r\nreligion. The site has been identified as that of the modern village\r\nof Practica, where a few miserable shepherds collect during the winter\r\nmonths, fleeing to the hills at the approach of summer and the dread\r\n_malaria_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Cf. Polybius, XII, 4: 'For in Italy the swineherds manage\r\nthe feeding of their pigs in the same way. They do not follow close\r\nbehind the beasts, as in Greece, but keep some distance in front of\r\nthem, sounding their horn every now and then: and the animals follow\r\nbehind and run together at the sound. Indeed, the complete familiarity\r\nwhich the animals show with the particular horn to which they belong\r\nseems at first astonishing and almost incredible. For, owing to the\r\npopulousness and wealth of the country, the droves of swine in Italy\r\nare exceedingly large, especially along the sea coast of the Tuscans\r\nand Gauls: for one sow will bring up a thousand pigs, or some times\r\neven more. They, therefore, drive them out from their night styes to\r\nfeed according to their litters and ages. When if several droves are\r\ntaken to the same place they cannot preserve these distinctions of\r\nlitters: but they, of course, get mixed up with each other both as\r\nthey are being driven out and as they feed, and as they are being\r\nbrought home. Accordingly, the device of the horn blowing has been\r\ninvented to separate them when they have got mixed up together,\r\nwithout labour or trouble. For as they feed one swineherd goes in\r\none direction sounding his horn, and another in another and thus the\r\nanimals sort themselves of their own accord and follow their own horn\r\nwith such eagerness that it is impossible by any means to stop or\r\nhinder them. But in Greece when the swine get mixed up in the oak\r\nforests in their search for the mast, the swineherd who has most\r\nassistants and the best help at his disposal, when collecting his own\r\nanimals drives off his neighbours' also. Some times, too, a thief lies\r\nin wait and drives them off without the swineherd knowing how he has\r\nlost them, because the beasts straggle a long way from their drivers\r\nin their eagerness to find acorns, when they are just beginning to\r\nfall.'\r\n\r\nBishop Latimer in one of his sermons quotes the phrase used in his\r\nyouth, at the time of the discovery of America, in calling hogs: 'Come\r\nto thy minglemangle, come pur, come pur.' It would be impossible to\r\ntranscribe the traditional call used in Virginia. One some times\r\nthinks that it was the original of the celebrated 'rebel yell' of\r\nGeneral Lee's army.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: The use of the Greek salutation was esteemed by the more\r\naustere Romans of the age of Scipio an evidence of preciosity, to be\r\nlaughed at: and so Lucienus' jesting apology for the use of it here\r\ndoubtless was in reference to Lucilius' epigram which Cicero has\r\npreserved, _de Finibus_, I, 3.\r\n\r\n       \"Graece ergo praetor Athenis\r\n  Id quod maluisti te, quum ad me accedi, saluto\r\n  [Greek: Chaire] inquam, Tite: lictores turma omni cohorsque\r\n  [Greek: Chaire] Tite!

Valerius Maximus (VIII, 8 _ad fin_.) cites a case of\r\na Roman citizen who was put to death, because, to satisfy the craving\r\nof one of his children for beef to eat, he slew an ox from the plough.\r\nOvid puts this sentiment in the mouth of Pythagoras, when he agrees\r\nthat pigs and goats are fit subjects for sacrifice, but protests\r\nagainst such use of sheep and oxen.

It may be conjectured, however, on the analogy of Samson's\r\nriddle to the Philistines, \"Out of the eater came forth meat, and\r\nout of the strong came forth sweetness,\" (_Judges_, XIV, 14), that\r\nPlautius meant to imply that some good might be the consequence of the\r\nevil Hirrius had done: and that Vaccius cited the allusion to suggest\r\nto Varro that, while he might know nothing much about cattle,\r\nhis attempt to deal with the subject might provoke some useful\r\ndiscussion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Darwin, _Animals and Plants_, II, 20, cites this passage\r\nand says that \"at the present day the natives of Java some times drive\r\ntheir cattle into the forests to cross with the wild Banteng.\" The\r\ncrossing of wild blood on domestic animals is not, however, always\r\nsuccessful. A recent visitor to the German agricultural experiment\r\nstation at Halle describes \"a curious hairy beast with great horns,\r\na wild look in his eye, a white streak down his back and a bumpy\r\nforehead, which had in it blood from cattle which had lived on the\r\nplains of Thibet, which had grazed on the lowland pastures of Holland,\r\nwhich had roamed the forests of northeast India and of the Malay\r\nPeninsular, and had wandered through the forests of Germany. We\r\nAmericans had sympathy for this beast. He was some thing like\r\nourselves, with the blood of many different races flowing through his\r\nveins.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Pliny (VIII, 66) cites the fact that the Scythians always\r\npreferred mares to stallions for war, and gives an ingenious reason\r\nfor the preference. Aristotle (_H.A._ VI, 22) says that the Scythians\r\nrode their pregnant mares until the very last, saying that the\r\nexercise rendered parturition more easy. Every breeder of heavy draft\r\nhorses has seen a mare taken from the plough and have her foal in the\r\nfield, with no detriment to either: and the story of the mare Keheilet\r\nAjuz, who founded the best of the Arab families, is well known, but\r\nbears repetition. I quote from Spencer Borden, _The Arab Horse_, p.\r\n44: \"It is related that a certain Sheik was flying from an enemy,\r\nmounted on his favourite mare. Arab warriors trust themselves only to\r\nmares, they will not ride a stallion in war. The said mare was at the\r\ntime far along toward parturition: indeed she became a mother when the\r\nflying horseman stopped for rest at noonday, the new comer being a\r\nfilly. Being hard pressed the Sheik was compelled to remount his mare\r\nand again seek safety in flight, abandoning the newborn filly to her\r\nfate. Finally reaching safety among his own people, great was the\r\nsurprise of all when, shortly after the arrival of the Sheik on his\r\nfaithful mare, the little filly less than a day old came into camp\r\nalso, having followed her mother across miles of desert. She was\r\nimmediately given into the care of an old woman of the tribe (Ajuz\r\n= an old woman), hence her name Keheilet Ajuz, 'the mare of the old\r\nwoman,' and grew to be the most famous of all the animals in the\r\nhistory of the breed.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: Varro does not describe the livery of the horses of his\r\nday, as he does of cattle, but Virgil (_Georg_. III, 81) supplies the\r\ndeficiency, asserting that the best horses were bay (_spadices_) and\r\nroan (_glauci_) while the least esteemed were white (_albi_) and dun\r\n(_gilvi_), which is very interesting testimony in support of the most\r\nrecent theory of the origin of the thoroughbred horse. Professor\r\nRidgeway who, opposing Darwin's conclusion, contends for a multiple\r\norigin of the historic and recent races of horses, has collected a\r\nmass of information about the marking of famous horses of all ages in\r\nhis _Origin and Influence of the Thoroughbred Horse_. He maintains\r\nthat a bay livery, with a white star and stockings, the development\r\nof protective coloration from an originally striped coat, such as has\r\ngone on more recently in the case of the quaggas, is absolute evidence\r\nof the North African origin of a horse, and he shows that all the\r\nswiftest horses mentioned in history are of that race, while the\r\nheavier and less mettlesome horses of Northern origin have been, when\r\npure bred, dun coloured or white.\r\n\r\nOf the Italian breeds mentioned by Varro, Professor Ridgeway\r\nconjectures that the Etruscan (or Rosean) was probably an improved\r\nNorthern horse, while the Apulian, from the South of Italy,\r\nrepresented an admixture of Libyan blood.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: Aristotle (_H.A._ VI, 22) preceded Varro with this good\r\nadvice, saying that a mare \"produces better foals at the end of four\r\nor five years. It is quite necessary that she should wait one year\r\nand should pass through a fallow, as it were--[Greek: poiein osper\r\nneion].\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Mules were employed in antiquity from the earliest times.\r\nIn Homer they were used for drawing wagons: thus Nausicaa drove a mule\r\nteam to haul out the family wash, and Priam made his visit to Achilles\r\nin a mule litter. Homer professes to prefer mules to oxen for\r\nploughing. There were mule races at the Greek games. Aristotle\r\n(_Rhetoric_, III, 2) tells an amusing story of Simonides, who, when\r\nthe victor in the mule race offered him only a poor fee, refused to\r\ncompose an ode, pretending to be shocked at the idea of writing about\r\n\"semi-asses,\" but, on receipt of a proper fee, he wrote the ode\r\nbeginning: \"Hail, daughters of storm-footed mares,\" although they were\r\nequally daughters of the asses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: The breed of Maremma sheep dogs, still preferred in\r\nItaly, is white. He is doubtless the descendant of the large woolly\r\n\"Spitz\" or Pomeranian wolf dog which is figured on Etruscan coins.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: In his essay,_Notre ami le chien_, Maeterlinck maintains\r\neloquently that the dog alone among the domestic animals has given his\r\nconfidence and friendship to man. \"We are alone, absolutely alone, on\r\nthis chance planet: and amid all the forms of life that surround us\r\nnot one excepting the dog has made alliance with us. A few creatures\r\nfear us, most are unaware of us, and not one loves us. In the world of\r\nplants, we have dumb and motionless slaves: but they serve us in spite\r\nof themselves.... The rose and the corn, had they wings, would fly at\r\nour approach, like birds. Among the animals, we number a few servants\r\nwho have submitted only through indifference, cowardice or stupidity:\r\nthe uncertain and craven horse, who responds only to pain and is\r\nattached to nothing ... the cow and the ox happy so long as they are\r\neating and docile because for centuries they have not had a thought of\r\ntheir own.... I do not speak of the cat, to whom we are nothing more\r\nthan a too large and uneatable prey: the ferocious cat whose side long\r\ncontempt tolerates us only as encumbering parasites in our own homes.\r\nShe at least curses us in her mysterious heart: but all the others\r\nlive beside us as they might live beside a rock or a tree.\"\r\n\r\nThe effective use of this thesis in the scene of the revolt of the\r\ndomestic animals in the Blue Bird will be remembered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: This method of securing the faithful affection of a dog\r\nis solemnly recommended, without acknowledgment to Saserna, in the\r\nseventeenth century editions of the _Maison Rustique_ (I, 27).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Keil happily points out that in his book on the Latin\r\nlanguage (VII, 31), Varro quotes the \"ancient proverb\" to which he\r\nhere refers, viz.: \"canis caninam non est\" dog doesn't eat dog.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Aristotle (_H.A._ VI, 20) says that puppies are blind\r\nfrom twelve to seventeen days, depending upon the season of the year\r\nat which they are born.

These are tall conical thatched huts which the\r\nshepherds make their winter abode. For in Italy, the lowlands being\r\ngenerally unhealthy in summer, the flocks are driven to the mountains\r\nabout May, and as soon as the great heats are past are brought back to\r\nthe rich pastures of the plains. It is a curious sight, the interior\r\nof a _capanna_, and affords an agreeable diversity to the antiquity\r\nhunter. A little boldness is requisite to pass through the pack of\r\ndogs, white as new dropt lambs, but large and fierce as wolves, which,\r\nwere the shepherd not at hand, would tear in pieces whoever might\r\nventure to approach the hut: but with one of the _pecoraj_ for a\r\nTeucer, nothing is to be feared. The _capanne_ are of various sizes.\r\nOne I entered not far from Veii was thirty or forty feet in diameter\r\nand fully as high, propped in the centre by two rough masts, between\r\nwhich a hole was left in the roof for the escape of smoke. Within the\r\ndoor lay a large pile of lambs, there might be a hundred, killed that\r\nmorning and already flayed, and a number of shepherds were busied\r\nin operating on the carcases of others: all of which were to be\r\ndispatched forthwith to the Roman market. Though a fierce May sun\r\nblazed without, a huge fire roared in the middle of the hut: but this\r\nwas for the sake of the _ricotta_, which was being made in another\r\npart of the _capanna_. Here stood a huge cauldron, full of boiling\r\newes' milk. In a warm state this curd is a delicious jelly and has\r\noften tempted me to enter a _capanna_ in quest of it, to the amazement\r\nof the _pecoraj_, to whom it is _vilior alga_. Lord of the cauldron,\r\nstood a man dispensing ladlefuls of the rich simmering mess to his\r\nfellows, as they brought their bowls for their morning allowance:\r\nand he varied his occupation by pouring the same into certain small\r\nbaskets, the serous part running off through the wicker and the\r\nresidue caking as it cooled. On the same board stood the cheeses,\r\npreviously made from the cream. In this hut lived twenty-five men,\r\ntheir nether limbs clad in goat skins, with the hair outwards,\r\nrealizing the satyrs of ancient fable: but they had no nymphs to\r\ntease, nor shepherdesses to woo, and never\r\n\r\n          'sat all day\r\n  Playing on pipes of corn, and versing love\r\n  To amorous Phillida.'\r\n\r\nThey were a band of celibates without the vows. In such huts they\r\ndwell all the year round, flaying lambs or shearing sheep, living\r\non bread, _ricotta_ and water, very rarely tasting meat or wine and\r\nsleeping on shelves ranged round the hut, like berths in a ship's\r\ncabin. Thus are the dreams of Arcadia dispelled by realities.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: In modern Italy the shepherds do not take their women\r\nwith them to the _saltus_, but, as Dennis says, lead there the life of\r\n\"celibates, without the vows.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: In the Venitian provinces of Italy today the women are\r\nstill seen at work in the harvest and rice fields with their babes in\r\ntheir bosoms: but the most amazing modern spectacle of this kind\r\nis that of women coaling ships in the East, carrying their unhappy\r\nyoungsters up and down the coal ladders throughout the work.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: The author of _Maison Rustique_ did not agree with Varro\r\nin this opinion. I quote from Surflet's translation of 1606 (I, 7):\r\n\r\n\"And for writing and reading it skilleth not whether he be able to\r\ndoe it or no, or that he should have any other charge to looke unto\r\nbesides that of yours, or else that he should use another to set downe\r\nin writing such expences as he hath laid out: for paper will admit any\r\nthing.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: This temple and fig tree stood in Rome at the foot of the\r\nPalatine hill, in the neighbourhood of the Lupercal.

Varro himself wore a beard, as appears on the coin he\r\nstruck during the war with the Pirates. It is reproduced in Smiths\r\n_Dict. Gr. and Rom. Biog_., III, p. 1227.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: Cowper's verse in _The Task_ seems to be all that is\r\nhappy in the way of translation of Varro's text, \"divina natura dedit\r\nagros, ars humana aedificavit urbes\": but Cowley's \"God the first\r\ngarden made, and the first city Cain\" was probably Cowper's source.\r\nCowley was a reader of Varro, as his pleasant and sane essay _Of\r\nAgriculture_ shows.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: Following the precedent of the first and second books in\r\nthe matter of local colour, the scene of this third book, relating to\r\nvillas and the \"small deer,\" which were there reared, is laid in\r\nthe _villa publica_ at Rome, and the characters of the dialogue are\r\nselected for the suggestion which their names may make of the denizens\r\nof the aviary, the barn yard and the bee-stand.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: This Appius Claudius Pulcher served in Asia under his\r\nbrother-in-law Lucullus, was Augur in B.C. 59, Consul in 54 and Censor\r\nin 50. He wrote a book on augural law and the habits of birds at which\r\nCicero poked some rather mean fun. He fixes the date of the dialogue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: In Varro's time, as today, the river Velinus drained the\r\nfresh pastures of the Umbrian prairie of Rosea, \"the nurse of Italy,\"\r\nwhich lay below the town of Reate (the modern Rieti), and was\r\noriginally the bed of a lake. Its waters are so strongly impregnated\r\nwith carbonate of lime that by their deposit of travertine they tend\r\nto block their own channel. The drainage of Rosea has, therefore,\r\nalways been a matter of concern to the live stock industry of Reate,\r\nand in B.C. 272 M. Curius Dentatus opened the first of several\r\nsuccessful artificial canals (the last dating from the sixteenth\r\ncentury, A.D.), which still serve to lead the Velinus into the Nar at\r\nthe renowned Cascate delle Marmore. For two hundred years the people\r\nof Interamna (the modern Terni) had complained that their situation\r\nbelow the falls was endangered by Curius' canal, and finally in B.C.\r\n54 the Roman Senate appointed the commission to which Appius Claudius\r\nrefers in the text, to hear the controversy. Cicero was retained as\r\ncounsel for the people of Reate, and during the hearing stopped, as\r\nAppius Claudius did, with our friend Axius at his Reatine villa, and\r\nwrote about the visit to the same Atticus whom we met in Varro's\r\nsecond book, as follows (_ad Atticum_, IV, 15): \"After this was over\r\nthe people of Reate summoned me to their Tempe to plead their\r\ncause against the people of Interamna, before the Consul and ten\r\ncommissioners, the question being concerning the Veline lake, which,\r\ndrained by M. Curius by means of a channel cut through the mountain,\r\nnow flows into the Nar: by this means the famous Rosea has been\r\nreclaimed from the swamp, though still fairly moist. I stopped with\r\nAxius, who took me also to visit the Seven Waters.\" What was once\r\ndeemed a danger is a double source of profit to the modern folk of\r\nInteramna. Tourists today crowd to see the same waterfall which Cicero\r\nvisited, taking a tram from the busy little industrial town of Terni:\r\nand the waters which flow from Velinus now serve to generate power\r\nwith which armour plates are manufactured for the Italian navy on the\r\nsite of the ancient Interamna.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: Sicilian honey was famous for its flavour because of\r\nthe bee pasture of thyme which there abounded, especially at Hybla.\r\nTheophrastus (H.P. III, 15, 5) explains that the honey of Corsica had\r\nan acrid taste, because the bees pastured there largely on box trees.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: These denizens of the Roman villa are all enumerated by\r\nMartial in his delightful verses (III, 38) upon Faustinus' villa at\r\nBaiae. The picture of the barn yard is very true to life in all ages,\r\nespecially the touch of the hungry pigs sniffing after the pail of the\r\nfarmer's wife:\r\n\r\n  \"Vagatur omnis turba sordidae cortis\r\n  Argutus anser, gemmeique pavones\r\n  Nomenque debet quae rubentibus pennis,\r\n  Et picta perdix, Numidicaeque guttatae\r\n  Et impiorum phasiana Colchorum.\r\n  Rhodias superbi feminas prement galli\r\n  Sonantque turres plausibus columbarum,\r\n  Gemit hinc palumbus, inde cereus turtur\r\n  Avidi sequuntur villicae sinum porci:\r\n  Matremque plenam mollis agnus exspectat.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: The _sestertius_ was one quarter of a _denarius_, or,\r\nsay, the equivalent of five cents. It was also called _nummus_, as\r\nwe say \"nickel.\" The ordinary unit used by the Romans in reckoning\r\nconsiderable sums of money was 1,000 sesterces, which may accordingly\r\nbe translated as the equivalent of (say) $50. Axius' jackass thus cost\r\n$2,000, while Seius' income from his villa was $2,500 per annum, that\r\nof Varro's aunt from her aviary was $3,000, and that of Axius from\r\nhis farm $1,500. Cicero records that Axius was a money lender, which\r\nexplains the fun here made of his avarice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: Columella, writing about one hundred years after Varro,\r\nrefers to this passage and says that luxury had so developed since\r\nVarro's time that it no longer required an extraordinary occasion,\r\nlike a triumph, to bring the price of thrushes to three _denarii_ a\r\npiece, but that that had become a current quotation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: A minerval was the fee (of Minerva) paid to a school\r\nteacher.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 166: The inventor of the auspices _ex tripudiis_ or the\r\nfeeding of chickens was evidently an ingenious poultry fancier who\r\nsucceeded in securing the care of his favourites at the public\r\ncharge.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 167: This was L. Marcius Philippus, the orator mentioned\r\nby Horace (_Epist_. I, 7, 46), who was Consul in B.C. 91, and was\r\ncelebrated for his luxurious habits, which his wealth enabled him to\r\ngratify. His son married the widow of C. Octavius and so became the\r\nstep-father of the Emperor Augustus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: This was _turdus pilaris_, the variety of thrush which is\r\ncalled field fare.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 169: The traveller by railway from Rome to Naples passes near\r\nVarro's estate of Casinum, and if he stops at the mediaeval town of\r\nSan Germano to visit the neighbouring Badia di Monte Cassino, where\r\nthe \"angelic doctor\" Thomas Aquinas was educated, he will find Varro's\r\nmemory kept green: for he will be entertained at the _Albergo Varrone_\r\n(\"very fair but bargaining advisable,\" sagely counsels Mr. Baedeker)\r\nand on his way up the long winding road to the Abbey there will be\r\npointed out to him the river Rapido, on the banks of which Varro's\r\naviary stood, and nearby what is reputed to be the site of the\r\nold polymath's villa which Antony polluted with the orgies Cicero\r\ndescribed in the second Philippic. Antony's destruction of his library\r\nwas a great blow to Varro, but one likes to think that his ghost can\r\ntake satisfaction in the maintenance, so near the haunts of his flesh,\r\nof such a noble collection of books as is the continuing pride of the\r\nAbbey on the mountain above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 170: Varro's Museum, or study where he wooed the Muses, on his\r\nestate at Casinum was not unlike that of Cicero at his native Arpinum,\r\nwhich he described (de Leg. II, 3) agreeably as on an island in the\r\ncold and clear Fibrenus just above its confluence with the more\r\nimportant river Liris, where, like a plebeian marrying into a\r\npatrician family, it lost its name but contributed its freshness. The\r\nyounger Pliny built a study in the garden of his Laurentine villa near\r\nOstia, which he describes (II, 17) with enthusiasm: \"horti diaeta est,\r\namores mei, re vera amores\": and here he found refuge from the tumult\r\nof his household during the festivities of the Saturnalia, which\r\ncorresponded with our Christmas. In the ante bellum days every\r\nVirginia gentleman had such an \"office\" in his house yard where he\r\npretended to transact his farm business, but where actually he\r\nwas wont to escape from the obligations of family and continuous\r\nhospitality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 171: The commentators on this interesting but obscure\r\ndescription of Varro's aviary have at this point usually endeavoured\r\nto explain the arrangements of the chamber under the lantern of\r\nthe _tholus_ with respect to its use as a dining room which Varro\r\nfrequented himself, and hence have been amused into all kinds of\r\ndifficulties of interpretation. The references to the _convivae_ are\r\nwhat lead them astray, and it remained for Keil to suggest that this\r\nwas a playful allusion to the birds themselves, a conclusion which is\r\nstrengthened by Varro's previous statement of the failure of Lucullus'\r\nattempt to maintain a dining room in his aviary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Cf. Vitruvius, I, 6: \"Andronicus Cyrrhestes built at\r\nAthens an octagonal marble tower, on the sides of which were carved\r\nimages of the eight winds, each on the side opposite that from which\r\nit blew. On the pyramidal roof of this tower he placed a bronze Triton\r\nholding a rod in his right hand, and so contrived that the Triton,\r\nrevolving with the wind, always stood opposed to that which prevailed,\r\nand thus pointed with his rod to the image on the tower of the wind\r\nthat was blowing at the moment.\" The ruins of this Tower of the Winds\r\nmay still be seen in Athens. There is a picture of it in Harper's\r\nDictionary of Classical Antiquities in the article _Andronicus_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 173: One ventures to translate _athletoe comitiorum_ by Mr.\r\nGladstone's famous phrase.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 174: Reading \"tesserulas coicientem in loculum.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 175: A French translator might better convey the intention\r\nof the pun, contained in the _ducere serram_ of the text, by the\r\nlocution, _une prise de bec_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 176: It probably will not comfort the ultimate consumer who\r\nholds in such odium the celebrated \"Schedule K\" of the Payne-Aldrich\r\ntariff, to realize that the American wool grower puts no higher\r\nvalue on his sheep than did his Roman ancestor, as revealed by this\r\nquotation from the stock yards of Varro's time. It is interesting,\r\nhowever, to the breeder to know that a good price for wool has always\r\nstimulated the production of the best stock. Strabo says that the wool\r\nof Turdetania in Spain was so celebrated in the generation after Varro\r\nthat a ram of the breed (the ancestors of the modern Merino) fetched\r\na talent, say $1,200; a price which may be compared with that of the\r\nprize ram recently sold in England for export to the Argentine for as\r\nmuch as a thousand pounds sterling, and considered a good commercial\r\ninvestment at that. Doubtless the market for Rosean mules comforted\r\nAxius in his investment of the equivalent of £400 in a breeding jack.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 177: In feudal times the right to maintain a dove cote was\r\nthe exclusive privilege of the lord of the manor. According to their\r\nimmemorial custom, which Varro notices, the pigeons preyed on the\r\nneighbourhood crops and were detested by the community in consequence.\r\nDuring the French revolution they were one of the counts in the\r\nindictment of the land-owning aristocracy, and in the event the\r\npigeons as well as their owners had the sins of their forefathers\r\njustly visited upon them. The American farmer who has a pigeon-keeping\r\nneighbour and is restrained by the pettiness of the annoyance from\r\nmaking a point on their trespasses, feels something of the blind and\r\nimpotent wrath of the French peasant against the whole pigeon family.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 178: It appears that the Romans actually hired men to chew the\r\nfood intended for cramming birds, so as to relieve the unhappy victims\r\neven of such exercise as they might get from assimilating their diet.\r\nColumella (VII, 10) in discussing the diet of thrushes deprecates\r\nthis practice, sagely saying that the wages of the chewers are out\r\nof proportion to the benefit obtained, and that any way the chewers\r\nswallow a good part of what they are given to macerate.\r\n\r\nThe typical tramp of the comic papers who is forever looking for\r\noccupation without work might well envy these Roman professional\r\nchewers. Not even Dr. Wiley's \"poison squad\" employed to test food\r\nproducts could compare with them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 179: These prices of $10 and $50 and even $80 a pair for\r\npigeons, large as they seem, were surpassed under the Empire.\r\nColumella says (VIII, 8): \"That excellent author, M. Varro, tells us\r\nthat in his more austere time it was not unusual for a pair of pigeons\r\nto sell for a thousand sesterces, a price at which the present day\r\nshould blush, if we may believe the report that men have been found to\r\npay for a pair as much as four thousand _nummi_.\" ($200.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 180: The market for chickens and eggs in the United States\r\nwould doubtless astonish the people of Delos as much as the statistics\r\ndo us (ipsa suas mirantur Gargara messes!).

This practice is explained\r\nmore at length by Columella (VIII, 2, 3) who specifies the spurs,\r\n_calcaribus inustis_.\r\n\r\nBuffon, who describes a 'practice of trimming the combs of capons,\r\nadds (V, 302) an interesting account of an experiment which he says he\r\nhad made \"une espece de greffe animale\": after trimming the comb of\r\na growing cockerel his budding spurs were cut out and grafted on the\r\nroots of the comb, where they took root and flourished, growing to a\r\nlength of two and a half inches, in some cases curving forward like\r\nthe horns of a ram, and in others turning back like those of a goat.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 182: The dusting yard which Varro here describes was in the\r\nopen, but Columella (VIII, 3) advises what modern poultry farmers\r\npride themselves upon having recently discovered,--a covered\r\nscratching pen strewn with litter to afford exercise for the hens in\r\nrough weather. It will be observed that, so far as ventilation is\r\nconcerned, Varro recommends a hen house open to the weather: this is\r\nanother standard of modern practice which has had a hard struggle\r\nagainst prejudice. Columella adds two more interesting bits of advice,\r\nthat for the comfort of the hens the roosts should be cut square, and\r\nfor cleanliness their water trough should be enclosed leaving\r\nonly openings large enough to receive a hen's head. With so much\r\nenlightenment and sanitation one would expect one or the other of\r\nthese Romans to tell us of some \"teeming hen\" like Herrick's who laid\r\n\"her egg each day.\"\r\n\r\nWe are proud to be able to cite the eminent Roseburg Industrious Biddy\r\nwho, in the year of grace 1912, achieved the championship of America\r\nwith a record of 266 eggs in ten months and nineteen days, and was\r\nsold for $800: but Varro is content to suggest that a hen will lay\r\nmore eggs in a season than she can hatch, and the conservative\r\nColumella (VIII, 5) that the number of eggs depends upon diet.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 183: The guinea fowl got their Greek name, _meleagrides_,\r\nbecause the story was that the sisters of Meleager were turned into\r\nguinea hens. Pliny (_H.N._ X, 38) says that they fight every year on\r\nMeleager's tomb. It is a fact that they are a pugnacious fowl. Buffon\r\nsays that guinea fowl disappeared from Europe in the Dark Ages and\r\nwere not known again until the route to the Indies via the Cape of\r\nGood Hope was opened when they were imported anew from the west coast\r\nof Africa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 184: Reading, \"propter fastidium hominum.\" Cf. Pliny (X, 38),\r\nwhose explanation is \"propter ingratum virus.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 185: There is a Virginia practice of feeding a fat turkey\r\nheavily on bread soaked in wine or liquor just before he is killed,\r\nthe result being that as the turkey gets into that condition which\r\nused to put our ancestors under the table, he relaxes all his tendons\r\nand so is sweeter and more tender when he comes above the table. There\r\nis a humanitarian side to the practice which should recommend it even\r\nto the W.C.T.U. as well as to the epicure.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 186: Many thousands of geese used to be driven every year to\r\nRome from the land of the Morini in Northern Gaul, but the Germans are\r\nthe modern consumers. A British consular report says that in addition\r\nto the domestic supply a special \"goose train\" of from fifteen to\r\nforty cars is received daily in Berlin from Russia. It would seem that\r\nthe goose that lays the golden egg has emigrated to Muscovy. Buffon\r\nsays that the introduction of the Virginia turkey into Europe drove\r\nthe goose off the tables of all civilized peoples.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 187: Columella (VIII, 14) repeats this myth, but Aristotle\r\n(_H.A._ V, 2, 9) says that geese bathe _after_ breeding. Buffon gives\r\na Gallic touch, \"ces oiseaux preludent aux actes de l'amour en allant\r\nd'abord s'egayer dans l'eau.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 188: Reading _seris_. It is the _Cichorium endivia_ of\r\nLinnaeus. Cf. Pliny (_H.N._ XX, 32.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 189: Varro does not mention it, but the Romans knew and prized\r\n_pâté de foie gras_ under the name _ficatum_, which indicates that\r\nthey produced it by cramming their geese with a diet of figs. Cf.\r\nHorace's verse \"pinguibus et ficis pastum iecur anseris albi.\"\r\n\r\nIn Toulouse, whence now comes the best of this dainty of the epicure,\r\nthe geese are crammed daily with a dough of corn meal mixed with the\r\noil of poppies, fed through a tin funnel, which is introduced into the\r\nesophagus of the unhappy bird. At the end of a month the stertorous\r\nbreathing of the victim proclaims the time of sacrifice to Apicius.\r\nThe liver is expected to weigh a kilogram, (say two pounds), while\r\nat least two kilograms of fat are saved in addition, to garnish the\r\nfamily _plat_ of vegetables during the remainder of the year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 190: Reading _foeles_, which Keller, in his account of the\r\nfauna of ancient Italy in the Cambridge _Companion to Latin Studies_,\r\nidentifies with _Martes vulgaris_. Sir Anthony Fitzherbert calls them\r\nfullymartes. It does not appear that the Romans had in Varro's time\r\nbrought from Egypt our household cat, _F. maniculata_. They used\r\nweasels and tame snakes for catching mice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 191: Darwin (_Animals and Plants_, I, 8) cites this passage\r\nand argues that Varro's advice to cover the duck yard with netting to\r\nkeep the ducks from flying out is evidence that in Varro's time ducks\r\nwere not entirely domesticated, and hence that the modern domestic\r\nduck is the same species as the wild duck. It may be noted, however,\r\nthat Varro gives the same advice about netting the chicken yard,\r\nhaving said that chickens had been domesticated from the beginning of\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 192: The ancient Etruscan city of Tarquinii is now known\r\nas Corneto. The wild sheep which Lippinus there kept in his game\r\npreserves were probably the _mouflon_ which are still hunted in\r\nSardinia and Corsica, though they may have been the Phrygian wild\r\nsheep (_Aegoceros argali_) which Varro mentions in Book II. Pliny\r\n(_H.N._ VIII, 211) says that this Lippinus was the first of the Romans\r\nto keep wild animals enclosed; that he established his preserves\r\nshortly before the Civil Wars, and that he soon had imitators.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 193: Reading * * * * [Transcriber's note: the preceding four\r\n*s are actually four instances of the \"infinity\" symbol (like a digit\r\n8 rotated horizontally)]_passum_. The Roman mile, _mille passuum_, was\r\n142 yards less than the English mile.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 194: Of the three kinds of hares mentioned by Varro the\r\n\"common Italian kind\" was _L. timidus_, a roast shoulder of which\r\nHorace vaunts as a delicacy: the Alpine hare was _L. variabilis_,\r\nwhich grows white on the approach of winter: and the _cuniculus_ was\r\nthe common rabbit known to our English ancestors as the coney. Strabo\r\nrecords (Casaub, 144) that the inhabitants of the Gymnesian (Balearic)\r\nIslands in Spain sent a deputation to Augustus to request a military\r\nforce to exterminate the pest of rabbits, for such was their multitude\r\nthat the people were being crowded out of their homes by them, in\r\nwhich their plight was that of modern Australia. They were usually\r\nhunted in Spain with muzzled ferrets imported from Africa.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: The edible snail, _helix pomatia_, L., is still an\r\narticle of commerce in France and Italy. They prey upon vines and\r\ngive evidence of their appreciation of the best by abounding in the\r\nvineyards of the _Cote d'or_, the ancient Burgundy. There at the end\r\nof summer they are gathered for the double purpose of protecting the\r\nvines and delighting the epicure: are then stored in a safe place\r\nuntil cold weather, when they considerately seal up their own shells\r\nwith a calcareous secretion and so are shipped to market.\r\n\r\nHere is the recipe for 'escargots à la bourguignonne,' which despite\r\nthe prejudice engendered by _Leviticus_ (XI, 30.) may be recommended\r\nto the American palate jaded by beefsteak and potatoes and the high\r\ncost of living: \"Mettre les escargots a bouillir pendant 5 a 10\r\nminutes dans de l'eau salée, les retirer de leur coquille, les laver\r\na l'eau froide pour les debarrasser du limon, les cuire dans un\r\ncourt-bouillon fortement assaisonné. Apres cuisson les replacer dans\r\nle coquille bien nettoyee, en les garnissant au fond et par dessus\r\nd'une farce de beurre frais manipule avec un fin hachis de persil,\r\ncerfeuil, ail, echalote, sel et poivre. Avant de servir, faire\r\nchauffer au four.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: Reading LXXX _quadrantes_. A comparison may be made of\r\nthis capacity with that of the ordinary snail known to the Romans,\r\nfor their smallest unit of liquid measure was called a _cochlear_, or\r\nsnail shell, and contained.02 of a modern pint, or, as we may say,\r\na spoonful: indeed the French word _cuiller_ is derived from\r\n_cochlear_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: It is perhaps well to remind the American reader that the\r\nEuropean dormouse (_Myoxus glis_. Fr. _loir_. Ger. _siebenschlafer_)\r\nis rather a squirrel than a mouse, and that he is still esteemed a\r\ndainty edible, as he was by the Romans: indeed when fat, just before\r\nhe retires to hibernate, he might be preferred to 'possum and other\r\nstrange dishes on which some hospitable Americans regale themselves\r\nand the patient palates of touring Presidents. In his treatise _De re\r\nculinaria_ Apicius gives a recipe for a ragout of dormice which sounds\r\nappetizing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Darwin (_Animals and Plants_, XVIII) says: \"I have never\r\nheard of the dormouse breeding in captivity.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: Varro makes no mention of tea and bread and butter as\r\npart of the diet of a dormouse; so we are better able to understand\r\nhis abstinence at the mad tea party in _Alice in Wonderland_. As\r\nMartial (III, 58) calls him _somniculosus_, it is probable that his\r\ntable manners on that occasion were nothing new and that his English\r\nand German names were always justified.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: This is one of Varro's puns which requires a surgical\r\noperation to get it into one's head. Appius is selected to talk about\r\nbees because his name has some echo of the sound of _apis_, the word\r\nfor bee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: The study of bees was as interesting to the ancients as\r\nit is to us. There have survived from among many others the treatises\r\nof Aristotle, Varro, Virgil, Columella and Pliny, but they are all\r\nmade up, as Maeterlinck has remarked, of \"erreurs charmantes,\" and for\r\nthat reason the antique lore of bees is read perhaps to best advantage\r\nin the mellifluous verses of the fourth _Georgic_, which follow Varro\r\nclosely.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: He might have said also that the hexagonal form of\r\nconstruction employed by bees produces the largest possible result\r\nwith the least labour and material. Maeterlinck rehearses (_La Vie des\r\nAbeilles_, 138) the result of the study of this problem in the highest\r\nmathematics:\r\n\r\n\"Réaumur avait proposé au célèbre mathematicien Koenig le problem\r\nsuivant: 'Entre toutes les cellules hexagonales a fond pyramidal\r\ncompose de trois rhombes semblables et égaux, determiner celle qui\r\npeut être construite avec le moins de matière?' Koenig trouva qu'une\r\ntelle cellule avait son fond fait de trois rhombes dont chaque grand\r\nangle était de 109 degrés, 26 minutes et chaque petit de 70 degrés, 34\r\nminutes. Or, un autre savant, Maraldi, ayant mesuré aussi exactement\r\nque possible les angles des rhombes construits par les abeilles fixa\r\nles grands à 109 degrés, 28 minutes, et les petits a 70 degrés, 32\r\nminutes. Il n'y avait done, entre les deux solutions qu'une difference\r\nde 2 minutes. II est probable que l'erreur, s'il y en a une, doit être\r\nimputee a Maraldi plutot qu'aux abeilles, car aucun instrument ne\r\npermet de mesurer avec une precision infaìllible les angles des\r\ncellules qui ne sont pas assez nettlement definis.\"\r\n\r\nMaclaurin, a Scotch physicist, checked Koenig's computations and\r\nreported to the Royal Society in London in 1743 that he found a\r\nsolution in exact accord with Maraldi's measurements, thereby\r\ncompletely justifying the mathematics of the bee architect.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203: The Romans were as curious and as constant in the use of\r\nperfumes as we are of tobacco. It is perhaps well to remember that\r\nthey might find our smoke as offensive as we would their unguents.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Indeed one of the marvels of nature is the service\r\nwhich certain bees perform for certain plants in transferring their\r\nfertilizing pollen which has no other means of transportation. Darwin\r\nis most interesting on this subject.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 205: The ancients, even Aristotle, did not know that the queen\r\nbee is the common mother of the hive. They called her the king, and it\r\nremained for Swammerdam in the seventeenth century to determine with\r\nthe microscope this important fact. From that discovery has developed\r\nour modern knowledge of the bee; that the drones are the males and are\r\nsuffered by the (normally) sterile workers to live only until one of\r\nthem has performed his office of fertilizing once for all the new\r\nqueen in that nuptial flight, so dramatically fatal to the successful\r\nswain, which Maeterlinck has described with wonderful rhetoric,\r\nwhereupon the workers massacre the surviving males without mercy. This\r\nis the \"driving out\" which Varro mentions.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 206: This picture of the queen bee is hardly in accord with\r\nmodern observations. It seems that while the queen is treated with\r\nthe utmost respect, she is rather a royal prisoner than a ruler, and,\r\nafter her nuptial flight, is confined to her function of laying eggs\r\nincessantly unless she may be unwillingly dragged forth to lead a\r\nswarm. Maeterlinck thus pictures (_La Vie des Abeilles_, 174) her\r\nexistence with a Gallic pencil:\r\n\r\n\"Elle n'aura aucune des habitudes, aucunes des passions que nous\r\ncroyons inherentes à l'abeille. Elle n'eprouvera ni le desir du\r\nsoleil, ni le besoin de l'espace et mourra sans avoir visite une\r\nfleur. Elle passera son existence dans l'ombre et l'agitation de la\r\nfoule à la recherche infatigable de berceaux à peupler. En revanche,\r\nelle connaitra seule l'inquietude de l'amour.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 207: It would have interested Axius to know that the annual\r\nconsumption of honey in the United States today is from 100 to 125\r\nmillion pounds and that the crop has a money value of at least ten\r\nmillion dollars. To match Seius, we might put forward a bee farmer in\r\nCalifornia who produces annually 150,000 pounds of honey from 2,000\r\nhives.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 208: Maeterlinck has made a charming picture of this habit of\r\npropinquity of the bee-stand to the human habitation. He describes\r\n(_La Vie des Abeilles_, 14) the old man who taught him to love bees\r\nwhen he was a boy in Flanders, an old man whose entire happiness\r\n\"consistait aux beautés d'un jardin et parmi ces beautés la mieux\r\naimee et la plus visitées etait un roucher, composé de douze cloches\r\nde paille qu'il avait peint, les unes de rose vif, les autres de jaune\r\nclair, la plupart d'un bleu tendre, car il avail observé, bien avant\r\nles experiences de Sir John Lubbock, que le bleu est la couleur\r\npreferée des abeilles. Il avait installé ce roucher centre le mur\r\nblanchi de la maison, dans l'angle que formait une des ces savoureuses\r\net fraiches cuisines hollondaises aux dressoirs de faience ou\r\nétincalaient les etains et les cuivres qui, par la porte ouverte,\r\nse reflétaient dans un canal paisible. Et l'eau chargés d'images\r\nfamilières, sous un rideau de peupliers, guidait les regards jusqu'au\r\nrépos d'un horizon de moulins et de prés.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 209: Reading _Apiastro_. This is the _Melissa officinalis_ of\r\nLinnaeus. Cf. Pliny, XX, 45 and XXI, 86.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 210: Bee keepers attribute to Reaumur the invention of the\r\nmodern glass observation hive, which has made possible so much of our\r\nknowledge of the bee, but it may be noted that Pliny (_H.N._ XXI, 47)\r\nmentions hives of \"lapis specularis,\" some sort of talc, contrived for\r\nthe purpose of observing bees at work. The great advance in bee hives\r\nis, however, the sectional construction attributed to Langstroth and\r\ndeveloped in America by Root.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 211: Columella, (IX, 14) referring to the myth of the\r\ngeneration of bees in the carcase of an ox (out of which Virgil made\r\nthe fable of the pastor Aristaeus in the Fourth Georgic), explains\r\nthe practice mentioned in the text with the statement \"hic enim quasi\r\nquadam cognatione generis maxime est apibus aptus.\" The plastering\r\nof wicker hives with ox dung persisted and is recommended in the\r\nseventeenth century editions of the _Maison Rustique_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 212: Reading _seditiosum_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 213: This is a mistake upon which Aristotle could have\r\ncorrected Varro.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 214: After studying the commentators on this obscure passage,\r\nI have elected to follow the emendation of Ursinus, which, although\r\nKeil sneers at its license, has the advantage of making sense.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: _Sinapis arvensis_, Linn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: _Sium sisarum_, Linn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: The philosophy of the bee is not as selfish as that human\r\nprinciple which Varro attributes to them. The hive does not send forth\r\nits \"youth\" to found a colony, but, on the contrary, abandons its home\r\nand its accumulated store of wealth to its youth and itself ventures\r\nforth under the leadership of the old queen to face the uncertainties\r\nof the future, leaving only a small band of old bees to guard the\r\nhive and rear the young until the new queen shall have supplied a new\r\npopulation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: Reading _imbecilliores_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Pliny (_H.N_.
