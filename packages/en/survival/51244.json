And yet American\r\nbusiness, discounting all this, entered upon and passed through this\r\nperiod with full faith in a favorable outcome.\r\n\r\nWhile prosperity was general, the processes of realignment of our\r\neconomic relations hurt or temporarily hampered some lines of business.\r\nThe livestock and packing industries did not escape entirely unharmed.\r\n\r\nNaturally, proposed radical legislation, with accompanying agitation,\r\nand a slump in American meat exports, caused such violent disturbance\r\nof the livestock markets during the latter half of the year that both\r\nproducers and packers became deeply concerned as to the immediate\r\nfuture of the industry.\r\n\r\nNo array of proved facts as to the low percentage of packer profits,\r\nno pointing out of the real factors controlling meat and livestock\r\nprices was sufficient to convince the disturbed element of the public\r\nand certain agents of the Government that packers’ operations on the\r\nexisting large scale were justifiable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, by a recent understanding with the Government, Armour and\r\nCompany will dispose of all their interests in food production, not\r\ndirectly associated with and dependent upon the meat packing business.\r\nIn addition, Armour and other packers agree to relinquish interests\r\nin stock yards and railway terminal properties at the various market\r\ncenters. The terms of the understanding permit the retention of dairy\r\nand poultry products in view of the dependence of these on such\r\nrefrigerating and distributive facilities as the packers have provided.\r\n\r\nBoth patriotism and enlightened self-interest command every citizen\r\nand business to make concessions and sacrifices in times of crises,\r\nwhether of war or peace; and while Armour and Company felt that they\r\nwere clearly within their rights in their operations previous to this\r\nunderstanding with the Government, it was plainly in the line of public\r\nservice to make concessions that would clear the way towards public\r\nconfidence in the development of the livestock industry.\r\n\r\n    J. Ogden Armour\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Running against a “glutted market” in the “good old\r\ndays.” Today the stockman’s market is nation-wide.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow and Why Livestock Market Grew\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE was a time, within the memory of men still active in the cattle\r\nbusiness, when the capacity and demand of the local butcher shop\r\nmeasured the demand for fat stock and fixed the price as well.\r\n\r\nOn driving his cattle to the village, or negotiating for their sale,\r\nit was not uncommon for the stockman to be met with the news that a\r\nneighbor had got ahead of him and glutted the market with two or three\r\nor more meat animals. No matter how good the offerings, there was no\r\npresent market at any price.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of the livestock business in the “good old\r\ndays” before the establishing of the great packing centers; before the\r\ndevelopment of economical systems of slaughtering, saving the waste,\r\nand distributing dressed beef quickly and continuously to the remotest\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nNo stockman now considers the demand of the local butcher as a serious\r\nfactor in making or breaking the market for his cattle. If he is\r\nfeeding a carload or more, he has an approximate date set for the\r\nfinishing of his feed. By keeping in close touch with the supply of\r\ncattle in the country, their movement and the trend of prices, he\r\nchooses what appears to be the most favorable day and ships them to the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nEven if he is feeding only a few head, the disposal of them is not\r\ndependent upon local demand. He may double-up with his neighbors to\r\nmake up a car. He may belong to a shipping association that makes a\r\nbusiness of collecting small lots into carloads for direct shipment,\r\nand although he sells to the local stock buyer, his knowledge of what\r\nhis cattle are worth at the central markets enables him to secure a\r\nfair price.\r\n\r\nSo it has come about that world demand determines prices and governs\r\nbuying activities in every town and village where livestock is\r\npurchased. For local butchers everywhere are governed by prices at the\r\ncentral markets. The truth is that the most successful butchers no\r\nlonger do their own killing, but buy their beef from packers’ branch\r\nhouses in the larger cities and towns or from “route cars” running from\r\npacking plants or branch houses into the smaller communities.\r\n\r\nIn doing this they get better beef at lower cost than by local\r\nslaughtering, and they can serve their customers with a safer and more\r\nsatisfactory article because the animal is killed and the meat prepared\r\nunder the stringent government inspection and sanitary regulations\r\nthat are practiced only in the larger establishments. This insures\r\nabsolute freedom from diseased conditions and careless handling.\r\n\r\nPractical butchers, who are also feeders, have proved by test that they\r\ncan ship their beef cattle hundreds of miles to the big packer, have\r\nthem slaughtered, dressed and returned at less cost than they can do\r\ntheir own killing. This is possible because the utilization of every\r\nscrap of the animals in valuable by-products, and the saving in labor\r\nby wholesale slaughtering and handling, pay all expenses, including the\r\nfreight both ways, and leave a margin for the butcher besides.\r\n\r\nThe local butcher or livestock producer can little better afford to\r\nkill and prepare his own beef than he can afford to tan the hide and\r\nmake his own shoes. There was a time, even in America, when the farmer\r\nhimself actually did these things. He also sheared his own sheep by\r\nhand, while his wife and daughters spun the wool into yarn and wove\r\ncloth for the family clothing. Progress has made such methods absurd,\r\nunprofitable and impracticable.\r\n\r\nBut the great machinery of economical production and distribution\r\nwas not built in a day, or a year, or a decade. Armour and Company’s\r\nactivities began more than fifty years ago. At first the packing\r\nhouse was only a butcher shop on an enlarged scale, preparing and\r\nhandling pork products almost exclusively. Cattle were killed for\r\nlocal consumption only, as there was no such thing as cold storage,\r\nrefrigerator car lines or branch houses for the distribution of fresh\r\nmeats.\r\n\r\nIn those days the offal from the packing houses was thrown away or\r\nburied, as is still done to considerable extent by the small butcher\r\nat the present time. The by-products industries, by which hundreds\r\nof valuable articles are now created from what was once waste,\r\nwere developed through long years of scientific investigation and\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the Armour organization of today is the result of the\r\naccumulated efforts of thousands of trained scientific and business\r\nminds, applied through half a century to the solution of the problem of\r\nfactoring and furnishing food supplies for the nation and the world by\r\nthe most direct and efficient means.\r\n\r\nNothing less than a great and thoroughly organized concern could effect\r\nthe economies that make such achievement possible. Armour and Company’s\r\ngrowth has been, and is, simply the natural expansion of a great\r\nindustry keeping pace with the progress of the producer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-investment and Expansion Policy\r\n\r\n\r\nNO amount of criticism, investigation, misrepresentations or\r\n“exposures” has ever shaken Armour and Company’s faith in the fairness\r\nand final endorsement of the great body of American livestock producers.\r\n\r\nThat the consumer found grievance in recent high food prices and\r\nattributed his troubles to the packer or producer, or both, was perhaps\r\nnot to be wondered at, though his reasoning was not sound. That\r\ncompeting food distributors should object to the extension of packer\r\nefficiency to general food distribution is easily understood from these\r\ncompetitors’ viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of Armour and Company from all lines of production\r\nand distribution not directly associated with meats and livestock\r\nby-products, was in response to these disturbed elements of public\r\nopinion. But these restrictions of packer activities in no way affect\r\nthe relations of mutual confidence and dependence between Armour and\r\nCompany and the livestock producers.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental things remain, and they are these: The livestock\r\nindustry must continue to exist and expand; producers must be rewarded\r\nwith fair profits; livestock markets must be maintained and made more\r\nconvenient; and the markets for meat products must be enlarged and\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nTo these basic facts Armour and Company have pinned their business\r\nfaith, and upon them shaped their policy. Ninety per cent of the\r\nprofits of the Company have been re-invested in the business and\r\nare represented today by great packing plants at sixteen market\r\ncenters, and many branch houses throughout the country, together with\r\nrefrigerator car lines connecting the livestock markets with the\r\nconsuming centers of the nation.\r\n\r\nIt requires no argument to show the livestock producer that his\r\ninterests and profits are inseparably associated with these properties,\r\nand it is quite as plain that the necessities and conveniences of the\r\nconsuming public are dependent upon and served by them.\r\n\r\nAmerica and the world will continue to demand more and more meat and\r\nother products from livestock. Agriculture will not successfully\r\ncontinue without the production of meat animals. So the future reveals\r\nno reason why Armour and Company should not continue the policy of\r\nre-investing their earnings in the business that gives the most direct\r\nand substantial support to the basic industry of animal husbandry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The packer must, with utmost carefulness, balance his\r\ndaily purchases against his daily sales.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAspects of Big Business Explained\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE simple recital of an ordinary day’s doings of Armour and Company’s\r\nbeef department will make plain a number of things that may appear\r\nmysterious to a casual observer. Each day, at the opening of the\r\nmarket, the manager of the beef department must carefully weigh the\r\npossibilities of his sales and shipments of beef carcasses against the\r\nreceipts of cattle of the quality demanded by his trade. And he must\r\nbuy accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing idea that, because of cold storage facilities at\r\nthe packing centers, unlimited numbers of cattle of all grades and\r\nqualities can be absorbed and slaughtered, is wrong. For even though\r\ncold storage capacity were unlimited, beef cannot be held. Each day’s\r\nkill must find room in chill and storage rooms by the shipment of about\r\nan equal number of carcasses _out_ of storage to Armour’s branch houses\r\nlocated in all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThese branch houses must, in turn, dispose of each shipment promptly to\r\nmake room for new arrivals. Each branch manager receives a memorandum\r\nof the cost of the beef, and of course is expected to sell it at a\r\nprofit. But he _must_ sell it within a very limited time, even if he\r\ncannot show a profit.\r\n\r\nLocal conditions determine this. He may meet with unforeseen\r\ncompetition in the kind of meats he has ordered, or the demand for\r\nmeats may have fallen off for one or a dozen of reasons, or for no\r\ndiscoverable reason at all. These known and unknown influences on the\r\ndemand govern his market and he has to accept the situation, depending\r\non evening up the score under more favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nOf course a decline or advance at one or a few branch house points,\r\nfrom merely local causes, does not materially affect the market at the\r\npacking centers, but any widespread fluctuation from general causes is\r\nimmediately reflected in cattle prices at all of the great markets.\r\n\r\nThe best way for a producer to learn what determines the price he gets\r\nfor his livestock is to visit the nearest Armour branch house and get\r\nfirst hand information on the facts that govern meat prices at the\r\nfinal market.\r\n\r\nAny Armour branch manager will welcome visitors and willingly answer\r\nquestions. He will explain not only the factors that influence the\r\ngeneral level of prices, but will point out why cuts from certain types\r\nof beef carcasses are in constant demand at the highest prices, while\r\nsimilar cuts from other carcasses are neglected and sell materially\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nThere is a type of beef carcass that is best and commands the best\r\nprice, and it costs no more to produce than an inferior type. The same\r\nis true of mutton and pork. Any Armour branch manager will show you\r\nwhat these types are and the Armour Farm Bureau will furnish, without\r\ncharge, information on improved methods of producing the sort of\r\nanimals that are most in demand for meat purposes.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of the big packing business, the importance of which is not\r\ngenerally appreciated, is refrigeration. It is not too much to say that\r\nwithout ample means of refrigeration, both in storage and in transit,\r\nno fit and adequate supply of fresh meats and dairy products could be\r\nsupplied to the public.\r\n\r\nFood refrigeration originated with the meat packing business early in\r\nits history. At first only storage refrigeration was practiced for\r\nthe purpose of conserving and equalizing the supply of fresh meats\r\nfor local or near-by consumption. Then came the conception of transit\r\nrefrigeration, and the refrigerator car was invented, primarily for the\r\npurpose of shipping fresh meats from the producing centers of the West\r\nto the consuming centers of the East.\r\n\r\nFrom the transportation of fresh meats, the extension of the service\r\nto the carrying of fresh fruits, vegetables and dairy products was a\r\nnatural and easy step, resulting in the development and maintenance of\r\nthe great orchard lands and fruit and market garden areas from coast to\r\ncoast, and the tremendous expansion of the indispensable industry of\r\ndairy farming all over America.\r\n\r\nTo the livestock producer refrigeration in storage and in transit means\r\neverything. Without it the great packing interests could not exist and\r\nlivestock husbandry would revert to the primitive and unprofitable\r\nconditions prevailing fifty years ago and described in the preceding\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThese facts explain why Armour and Company have persistently\r\nopposed every attempt to deprive them of the exclusive use of their\r\nprivately-owned refrigerator cars and turn them over to the railroad\r\ncompanies for general use. To maintain the necessary constant movement\r\nof meat products Armour must have an adequate supply of these cars\r\nevery day in the year. Extended experience has proven that they would\r\nnot and could not be supplied by any form of railroad administration,\r\neither governmental or corporate, yet devised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeclining Livestock Prices and the Causes\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEFLY outlined herewith is a resumé of what are accepted as the chief\r\ncauses contributing to the sharp decline in livestock prices during\r\n1919.\r\n\r\nThe discontinuance of Government orders for beef was the principal\r\nthing which affected cattle prices in the late spring. From being a\r\npurchaser the Government became a seller in the domestic market. Added\r\nto this, there has been unusual labor unrest, large supplies, agitation\r\nagainst the high cost of living, low foreign exchange rates, and the\r\nEnglish boycott against high prices.\r\n\r\nThe falling off in hog prices was far more serious than in the case of\r\nbeef, because normal demand for hogs is based on the consideration of\r\nlarge exports, while the market for beef is primarily and principally\r\ndomestic.\r\n\r\nThe great demand for American pork products which was confidently\r\nexpected from European countries did not materialize, because of the\r\nextraordinary and unforeseen development of exchange conditions which\r\nmade purchases on the American market practically impossible.\r\n\r\nThe earlier part of 1919 was marked by an unprecedented export of pork\r\nproducts, reaching in the month of June the high point of over 400\r\nmillion pounds. From this point the drop was sharp and continuous,\r\nmonth by month, the figures for October showing total exports of less\r\nthan 120 million pounds—a falling off of 70% in four months. These\r\nlater exports were on orders booked earlier in the year, and not on new\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAdded to these principal factors, and aggravating them, were attempted\r\nboycotts of meat and proposed radical legislation for the regulation\r\nand restriction of the packing industry, and the resulting condition\r\nof uncertainty up to the very closing weeks of 1919, when the\r\nunderstanding between the packers and the U. S. Department of Justice\r\nwas made public.\r\n\r\nThe big question is, What of the year 1920? While nothing positive can\r\nbe predicted, better conditions is a practical certainty. The domestic\r\nconsumption of beef is increasing to a gratifying degree; the arranging\r\nof international credits and the opening of foreign markets is a matter\r\nof comparatively short time. European need for pork products will be\r\nurgent and excessive for a considerable time, and this will not only\r\ntake care of our surplus hogs, but will react favorably upon the market\r\nfor cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard Breeds _of_ Beef Cattle\r\n\r\n\r\nABERDEEN-ANGUS\r\n\r\nEarly maturing; transmits polled character; high dressing percentage;\r\nhigh proportion valuable cuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aberdeen-Angus]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTHORN\r\n\r\nGreatest weight for age; dress out well at slaughter; quiet\r\ndisposition; strong milking tendencies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shorthorn]\r\n\r\n\r\nGALLOWAY\r\n\r\nPrepotent; adapted to rugged regions; high carcass value; valuable hide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galloway]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLED SHORTHORN\r\n\r\nCharacteristics similar to Shorthorn except polled; some strains dual\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polled Shorthorn]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEREFORD\r\n\r\nBest grazing breed; matures early; fattens rapidly; good weight for age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hereford]\r\n\r\n\r\nRED POLLED\r\n\r\nStrictly dual purpose; fair grazers; early maturing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Red Polled]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Livestock Situation\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGHT now is a good time to stick to the middle of the highway of\r\ncommon sense. As shown in earlier chapters, the conditions adverse\r\nto the business can be only temporary, and even the losses incurred\r\nmay be turned to profit in the end, if the livestock men shall learn\r\nthe lesson of economy and efficiency of production and more complete\r\nco-operation among themselves and with the packing industry.\r\n\r\nRecent experiences will impel some producers to curtail or discontinue\r\ntheir operations temporarily, but others will take their places and\r\nquantity of production will be maintained while quality will be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nHigh-priced land, grain and labor will compel stockmen to grade up\r\ntheir herds, to discriminate more closely in the purchase of feeding\r\nstock, to improve feeding methods and to keep exact records of costs.\r\nFor at the higher level of costs and values all around, as compared\r\nwith prewar times, both the risks and rewards of the business will be\r\ngreater.\r\n\r\nAs co-operative activities are extended among producers, it may be\r\nfound advisable for livestock associations to employ expert buyers\r\nat the various markets whose duty shall be the filling of orders for\r\nassociation members, for the choice of feeders cannot be safely based\r\non personal fancy. The only true guide is unbiased judgment as to what\r\nthe market demands in the finished product and what type of feeding\r\ncattle will yield the result.\r\n\r\nAn experienced buyer of keen judgment, constantly in touch with the\r\nmarket, should prove as valuable to producers as the expert buyer of\r\nfat cattle is to the packer.\r\n\r\nSuch expert selection of feeders would take the guesswork out of the\r\nfirst and most important step in feeding.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the consumers’ demand is constantly for better\r\nmeats from comparatively young animals. Taking the situation the\r\ncountry over with present prices of feed stuffs considered, it has been\r\nfound that beef cattle make most money for the producer if not held\r\npast the age of two years. But there is no hard-and-fast rule for the\r\nguidance of every individual producer; the heavy, well-finished cattle\r\nalways bring high prices. Only by keeping an accurate feeding record\r\ncan the producer decide for himself what policy is most advantageous in\r\nhis case, or determine when his steers stop making sufficient gains to\r\ncompensate him for the feed required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArmour’s 1919 Livestock Purchases\r\n\r\n\r\nRISING prices of farm land and feed have changed entirely the\r\ncharacter of livestock received on the market as compared to twenty\r\nyears ago. The period following the war shows all conditions more or\r\nless accentuated, and one can trace very definitely the tendency to\r\nmarket animals younger and to feed to lesser ripeness than prevailed\r\nin the earlier years of the last decade. In 1919 Armour and Company\r\npurchased 12,235,451 head of livestock, while in 1918 they purchased\r\n11,398,131. Yet the animals bought last year weighed actually fewer\r\npounds, in spite of their greater numbers, than those received the\r\nyear preceding; the former weight being 3,740,347,223 pounds and the\r\nlatter 3,939,278,534 pounds. Furthermore, the animals of 1919 cost over\r\nnineteen million dollars more. The following table presents these facts\r\non a percentage basis:\r\n\r\n    Increased number animals 1919 over 1918    7.3%\r\n    Decrease in total weight animal purchases  5.0%\r\n    Increase in cost of animals                3.7%\r\n    Increased price per pound live weight      1.2¢\r\n\r\nProbably the fundamental factor in bringing about these conditions,\r\nwhich are distinctly unfavorable from a quality trade standpoint, is\r\nthe feeder’s expectation of declining prices. This attitude has driven\r\nall the animals to market almost as soon as they were in merchantable\r\nform. The late winter months of 1919-20 saw an opposite tendency among\r\nhog feeders, but this was not sufficiently marked to check the general\r\ntrend.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in stimulating this hurried marketing has been the\r\nbelief that more money could be made by selling the grain crop than by\r\nfeeding it. This has given short rations to many animals that would\r\nhave made suitable market records if handled properly, but it has\r\nenabled farmers to cash in their grain and meat crops while prices were\r\nrelatively high.\r\n\r\nIn terms of permanent agriculture it would have been better to leave\r\na greater share of this cash invested in a further development of\r\nlivestock, but the war order against feeding wheat placed the situation\r\nin some western states beyond the control of the average stockman. As a\r\ngeneral practice in production this incomplete utilization of livestock\r\nmust be deplored, although one cannot criticize the tendency under the\r\nspecial market conditions of 1919 and early 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Aspects of Livestock Industry\r\n\r\n\r\nONE of the most significant and gratifying gains in the livestock\r\nbusiness during the decade just past is the recognition of its\r\nfinancial soundness. This is reflected in the changed attitude of\r\nfinanciers and investors towards cattle paper. While a decade ago\r\nbankers in the great financial centers looked with suspicion upon\r\nsuch securities, now bankers and business men throughout the country\r\npurchase approximately $500,000,000 of cattle paper annually and regard\r\nit as among the safest investments.\r\n\r\nMelvin A. Traylor, President of the First Trust and Savings Bank\r\nof Chicago, declares that “loans on livestock are the best of all\r\ninvestments,” and President Thos. P. Martin, of the Oklahoma Stock\r\nYards Bank, Oklahoma City, agrees with him. This latter bank loaned\r\n$45,000,000 in seven years to cattle producers in Oklahoma, Texas and\r\nNew Mexico, only fifty dollars of the amount loaned being lost. It is\r\ndoubtful if any other industrial securities could make a better or even\r\nan equal showing.\r\n\r\nThere is still some difficulty in arranging loans in some sections of\r\nthe country, where bankers have not yet realized the changed conditions\r\nof the business and farmers have not given the proper emphasis to the\r\nimprovement of livestock production. But generally speaking the cattle\r\nfeeder with good judgment in the breeding and selection of feeders\r\nmeets with no obstacles in financing his operations.\r\n\r\nMost country bankers freely accept cattle paper because it is readily\r\nrediscounted in the country’s financial centers. But many of them urge\r\nthe borrowing feeders to keep accounts and determine accurately their\r\nprofits and losses.\r\n\r\nThis is to the interest of the feeder and the cattle industry as a\r\nwhole. For if the business is ever to be placed on a cost-of-production\r\nbasis for the reckoning of market prices, it must be done by an\r\naccumulation of thousands of actual tests in feeding practice. It\r\nis plain that each individual feeder could not set or ask a certain\r\npercentage of profit, since a poor judge of stock and a careless feeder\r\nwould demand more for an inferior product than the more efficient\r\nfeeder would ask for a better article.\r\n\r\nThe feasibility of any such scheme of regulating prices does not now\r\nappear, but it is clear in any case that each lot of cattle would have\r\nto be appraised at what their production _ought_ to cost, considering\r\nquality, and not what it actually _did_ cost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bankers now recognize cattle loans as good investments,\r\nand the skilled stockman has access to needed funds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLosses on Declining Markets\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT the packing industry suffers with the livestock producers on a\r\nfalling market was never more clearly emphasized than in the year\r\n1919. Armour and Company’s losses on dressed beef alone amounted, in\r\nthe twelve months, to several million dollars; and on the sale of pork\r\nproducts the losses were even greater.\r\n\r\nThese losses are figured on the basis of the primary sales, which\r\ninclude not only the meat but the hides and all other by-products\r\nderived from the animals.\r\n\r\nSuch deficits do not mean that the Armour organization, as a whole,\r\nsuffered a net loss for the year. But there is no mystery about the\r\nmethods of countering these deficits. They are offset by the profit\r\nmade in manufacturing by-products into merchantable commodities.\r\nEach by-product industry in the Armour organization is placed on its\r\nown responsibility. It must pay to the beef, hog, or sheep killing\r\ndepartment the market value for its raw materials—the same price it\r\nwould pay if it purchased on the outside market.\r\n\r\nFor example, the beef department buys its cattle to the best possible\r\nadvantage in competition with other buyers, and sells the beef at the\r\nbest price obtainable. The hides go to the tannery at prices ruling on\r\nthe open market. If the Armour tannery cannot pay this price the hides\r\ngo to outside buyers. To sell at less would be favoring the tannery at\r\nthe expense of the beef department, or robbing Peter to pay Paul.\r\n\r\nThe same business methods are pursued with every scrap of the animal,\r\nwhether used in making glue, soap, sand-paper, drugs, fertilizers, or\r\nany other commodity.\r\n\r\nWhile on this basis Armour and Company sustained heavy losses in their\r\nmeat departments, the by-product industries showed profits, as they\r\nusually do, because their products are not so perishable and are not so\r\nmuch influenced by market fluctuations.\r\n\r\nThese by-product industries are, in short, the insurance of the packers\r\nagainst crippling losses, and may be likened to the activities of the\r\nup-to-date livestock farmer, who diversifies his operations by feeding\r\ncattle and hogs and by keeping fowls, sheep and dairy cows, so that if\r\nhe loses on cattle or hogs he may offset his losses by better prices\r\nfor lambs, wool, butter, eggs, poultry, or a money crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Prices Fluctuate\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES for livestock are not controlled by packers, and only to a\r\nlimited extent by the supply of cattle in the market. They go up or\r\ndown in response to the price the consumer is willing to pay for meat.\r\n\r\nNote how closely the two lines in the chart, representing prices of\r\ncattle and dressed beef, follow each other through the two and a half\r\nyears covered by the graph. America’s twenty million food shoppers\r\ndetermine the dressed beef price, by their willingness or refusal to\r\naccept beef at the price asked in competition with other food. And\r\nnaturally dressed beef prices react directly and at once on cattle\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nIt is often necessary for the packer to take a marginal loss on beef in\r\norder to stimulate demand, but he must at once hedge against this loss\r\nby buying cattle cheaper. He tries to fit the price he pays for cattle\r\neach day to the price he is obtaining for beef. Only by so doing can he\r\nmaintain his business on present small margins. Large receipts of fish,\r\npoultry, game, eggs, vegetables or fruit at certain seasons also affect\r\nthe price the public is willing to pay for beef, and this is reflected\r\nin the price the packer can afford to pay for the live animal.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the packer cannot determine retail meat prices, simply\r\nbecause he cannot say to the consumer at the butcher’s counter, “You\r\nmust buy meat and you must pay such and such a price.” Because he\r\ncannot do this he cannot control the prices of livestock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT MAKES THE PRICE OF CATTLE\r\n\r\nTHIS CHART SHOWS THAT DEMAND BY CONSUMERS IS THE BIG FACTOR]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Efficient Distribution Means\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVESTOCK producers are, of course, engaged in an absolutely\r\nindispensable industry. Of scarcely less importance is the packing\r\nbusiness. For upon food production and preparation depend all other\r\nindustries and activities.\r\n\r\nBut it is profitable and enlightening to ask, of what use would be\r\nproduction and preparation without means for delivering the food to the\r\nconsumer? The mere asking brings realization of the prime importance\r\nof ample and uninterrupted transportation and distribution of packing\r\nhouse products to consumers through the retailers of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd this, in turn, brings us to the consideration of the packers’\r\nsalesmen in the hundreds of cities and towns throughout America, which\r\nas a whole make up the final market for the producer’s livestock.\r\n\r\nWith the sale of his meat animals by the commission man at the primary\r\nmarket, the owner seems to witness the end of the transaction as far as\r\nhe is concerned. But does he?\r\n\r\nCould the commission man sell and the packer buy the livestock if it\r\nwere not for another salesman and another buyer out at the farthest end\r\nof the market system transacting business with each other in the retail\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\nAgain the question answers itself. For the packer’s salesman is\r\nliterally the salesman of the livestock producer at the final market,\r\nupon which all other markets depend. The advertising and educational\r\nactivities conducted by the packer continuously broaden and intensify\r\nthe ultimate market for the products which the livestock man produces.\r\nIt devolves upon these agencies to keep the meat products moving\r\ntowards final consumption, just as the man at the measuring spout of\r\nthe old-fashioned threshing machine had to keep the grain out of the\r\nway and prevent congestion.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct divisions of the process of turning livestock\r\ninto available meat supplies. First, the production, shipment and sale\r\nof livestock. Second, the preparation, transportation and distribution\r\nof meat products to retailers. The two are interrelated and absolutely\r\ndependent one upon the other.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for organized producers to take complete possession\r\nof their end of the process by assuming control of the stockyards, is\r\noffered in the passing of that control from the packing industries by\r\nvirtue of the recent understanding with the U. S. Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The packer’s salesman is literally the farmer’s salesman\r\nin the thousands of “final markets” throughout the land.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFarming as a Business\r\n\r\n\r\nALL business undertakings are ventures. Under the best of conditions\r\nthere are fat and lean years, and the possibility of failure, due to\r\npoor management, lack of capital, or adversity, is always present.\r\n\r\nFarming is no exception. It is in essence a business proposition, and\r\nshould be so regarded.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of crops, of soils and tillage, of livestock breeding\r\nand feeding and other purely agricultural subjects constitutes but\r\none side of the farming industry. On top of this come the important\r\nmatters of business management—the buying of seeds, fertilizers, feed\r\nstuffs, livestock and general equipment and supplies; the erecting\r\nand maintenance of buildings; the arrangements for necessary credit;\r\nkeeping in touch with market conditions and prices; the hiring of\r\nhelp, and finally the establishing and operation of an accurate\r\ncost-accounting system.\r\n\r\nYet when all is said and done, records indicate that farming offers\r\nmore chances of success than almost any other line of business\r\nendeavor. A retail merchant, according to statistics, has from two\r\nto four chances in ten to conduct his business successfully for\r\nfifteen years; a manufacturer has from two to seven chances to do the\r\nsame. Farming is conspicuous for its small percentage of out-and-out\r\nfailures. Living is practically assured, which gives the farmer a\r\ndistinct working advantage to begin with. He enjoys a cash market and\r\nis not called upon to suffer bad debt losses. He is in an industry that\r\nis absolutely essential, which cannot be destroyed by any shifting of\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe greatest need is doubtless for cost-accounting systems which will\r\nserve as a guide, not only to prevent unwise purchases, but to indicate\r\nwise expenditures in improvements that will bring a good return on\r\ninvestment, and to show definitely the amount of profit obtained on\r\neach transaction. Next to this in importance is perhaps the need\r\nfor a thorough understanding of crop rotation and the principle of\r\ndiversified farming as a means of offsetting losses in one line with\r\ngains in another. The securing of credit to enable expansion, and the\r\nadoption of labor-saving devices are also essential.\r\n\r\nProfits and losses in farming must be reckoned, as in all other\r\nbusinesses, on averages over a term of years. But the future\r\noffers better assurance than ever before to the man who is a good\r\nagriculturist and at the same time a skillful business manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe Stand or Fall Together\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH some elements of the American public there seems to persist the\r\nconviction that the great packing concerns are seeking the injury of\r\nlivestock producers to their own enrichment. How such an idea can be\r\nseriously harbored by thinking men is hard to understand. For the\r\npacking industry to plan for the farmer anything but prosperity is to\r\nendanger or destroy the source of supply of the raw material by which\r\nit lives and grows.\r\n\r\nIt should be perfectly plain that the packers are selfishly interested\r\nin encouraging the producer. Their selling efforts are directed towards\r\ndisposing of the largest possible volume of meat products, at the best\r\nprice obtainable in competition with other foods, in order that they\r\nmay maintain large volume of livestock purchases at prices that will\r\nencourage both quantity and quality of production.\r\n\r\nBetween the producer and the consumer, between the buying and the\r\nselling price, the packers operate upon a smaller margin of profit than\r\nany other large industry. On invested capital they have realized an\r\naverage of about 9 per cent over a term of years, on volume of sales\r\nabout 2 per cent, and on each pound of meat less than one-half of a\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the risks of the business are greater than in other\r\nlines, both on account of the perishable nature of the product and the\r\nviolent fluctuations of food prices, the causes for which cannot always\r\nbe foreseen.\r\n\r\nThe comparative low prices of hogs and pork products at the end of 1919\r\nis a case in point. The packing business entered upon the year in the\r\nbelief that the world shortage of food would maintain pork prices at\r\nhigh levels for a number of years; that European demand would absorb\r\neven a larger surplus of American hogs than the pre-war period. The\r\nearlier months of 1919 confirmed this belief. The foreign demand was\r\nvery brisk, exports reached unprecedented volume and prices were\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nThen came the unlooked-for event. Foreign exchange rates fell to so low\r\na point that Europeans could no longer afford to buy American meats.\r\nThe packers extended credit for a time, but the limit of safety was\r\nsoon reached, and when the year closed very little American pork was\r\nbeing exported and no new contracts were being made.\r\n\r\nThe result was great loss to both producers and packers. Armour and\r\nCompany alone packed millions of pounds of pork during the period of\r\nhigh prices, much of which was still in the course of curing when the\r\nslump in the market came.\r\n\r\nBut the conditions that caused this decline and loss are exceptional\r\nand only temporary. The great foreign need for American meats still\r\nexists—the greatest need in the world’s history. The ability of Europe\r\nto buy will be restored with the full restoration of peace and the\r\narrangement of international credits. The result will be a return of\r\nprofits and prosperity to both producers and packers of pork.\r\n\r\nThe facts to keep in mind are these:\r\n\r\nFirst, there must finally be a realignment of prices on all livestock\r\nand meats, to levels below the prevailing high war prices. A fair\r\nbalance must be struck between the interests of the consumer and those\r\nof the producer. Prices for meat must be sufficiently attractive to\r\nconsumers to insure an adequate volume of sales; on the other hand\r\nprices for livestock must be sufficiently high to encourage production.\r\nOnly on this basis can the industry thrive.\r\n\r\nSecond, the utmost care must be taken in breeding and buying of feeding\r\nstock and the most exacting economy practiced in feeding methods.\r\n\r\nThird, the producer must realize that the packer is his natural ally\r\nin maintaining the prosperity of the two inseparable branches of the\r\nlivestock industry—production and packing.\r\n\r\nIt is a reassuring sign that producers and packers are already getting\r\ntogether on a platform of better understanding of their mutual\r\ninterests, both for protection against disturbing agitation and\r\nlegislation and for the correction of whatever inequalities or abuses\r\nmay exist in the shipping and marketing of livestock.\r\n\r\nArmour and Company’s Farm Bureau was established three years ago as a\r\npoint of contact with livestock men, through which better methods of\r\nbreeding, feeding, shipping and marketing could be promoted.\r\n\r\nBeing in constant touch with the requirements of the markets, Armour\r\nand Company know the types of meat animals which are most demanded\r\nand which bring the largest profit to the stockman. The Farm Bureau\r\nhas available many facts regarding the economical production of these\r\ntypes, and these facts can be had by addressing the Bureau, care of\r\nArmour and Company, Chicago.",
