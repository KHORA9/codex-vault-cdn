One reason for\r\ndoing so was that in consequence of the supineness of successive\r\nGovernments, and the neglect and wanton destruction by individuals, the\r\nBritish monuments are rapidly disappearing.\r\n\r\nAlthough, and indeed because, these inquiries are still incomplete, I\r\nnow bring together some of the notes I have collected, as they may\r\ninduce other inquirers to go on with the work. Some of the results\r\nalready obtained have been communicated to the Royal Society, and others\r\nhave appeared in articles published in _Nature_, but only a small\r\npercentage of the monuments available has so far been examined. Further\r\nobservations are required in order that the hypothesis set forth in this\r\nbook may be rejected or confirmed.\r\n\r\nIn the observations made at Stonehenge referred to in Chapter VII. I had\r\nthe inestimable advantage of the collaboration of the late Mr. Penrose.\r\nOur work there would not have been possible without the sympathetic\r\nassistance of Sir Edmund Antrobus, Bart.; Colonel Duncan A. Johnston,\r\nR.E., Director-General of the Ordnance Survey, also was good enough on\r\nseveral occasions to furnish us with much valuable information which is\r\nreferred to in its place. Messrs. Howard Payn and Fowler skilfully and\r\nzealously helped in the observations and computations. To all these I am\r\nglad to take this opportunity of expressing my obligations.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other monuments besides Stonehenge, I have to tender\r\nmy thanks to the following gentlemen for most valuable local\r\nassistance:--\r\n\r\n  Brittany--Lieut. de Vaisseau Devoir.\r\n\r\n  Stenness--Mr. Spence.\r\n\r\n  Stanton Drew--Professor Lloyd Morgan, Mr. Morrow, and Mr. Dymond.\r\n\r\n  The Hurlers, and the Merry Maidens--the Right Hon. Viscount Falmouth,\r\n  Capt. Henderson, Mr. Horton Bolitho and Mr. Wallis.\r\n\r\n  Tregaseal--Mr. Horton Bolitho and Mr. Thomas.\r\n\r\n  The Dartmoor Avenues--Mr. Worth.\r\n\r\nThe following have helped me in many ways, among them with advice and\r\ncriticism:--Principal Rhys, Dr. Wallis Budge, Dr. J. G. Frazer, and Mr.\r\nA. L. Lewis.\r\n\r\nThe assistance so generously afforded in the case of Stonehenge by\r\nColonel Johnston, R.E., in furnishing me with accurate azimuths was\r\ncontinued for the monuments subsequently investigated till his\r\nretirement. To his successor, Colonel R. C. Hellard, R.E., I am already\r\nunder deep obligations.\r\n\r\nFor the use of some of the Illustrations my thanks are due to the Royal\r\nSociety, the Society of Antiquaries, the Royal Institute of British\r\nArchitects, Messrs. Macmillan, and Mr. John Murray.\r\n\r\nI have to thank Mr. Rolston, F.R.A.S., one of my staff, for assistance\r\nin the computations involved.\r\n\r\n  NORMAN LOCKYER.\r\n\r\n  SOLAR PHYSICS OBSERVATORY,\r\n  _17th May, 1906_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  PREFACE                                                              v\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n  I.

Amongst these ceremonies, one especially refers\r\nto the fixing of the temple-axis; it is called, technically, “the\r\nstretching of the cord,” and is not only illustrated by inscriptions on\r\nthe walls of the temples of Karnak, Denderah and Edfu--to mention the\r\nbest-known cases--but is referred to elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDuring the ceremony the king proceeded to the site where the temple was\r\nto be built, accompanied mythically by the goddess Sesheta, who is\r\nstyled “the mistress of the laying of the foundation-stone.”\r\n\r\nEach was armed with a stake. The two stakes were connected by a cord.\r\nNext the cord was aligned towards the sun on some day of the year, or a\r\nstar, as the case might be; when the alignment was perfect the two\r\nstakes were driven into the ground by means of a wooden mallet. One\r\nboundary wall parallel to the main axis of the temple was built along\r\nthe line marked out by this stretched cord.\r\n\r\nIf the moment of the rising or setting of the sun or star were chosen,\r\nas we have every reason to believe was the case, seeing that all the\r\nearly observations were made on the horizon, it is obvious that the\r\nlight from the body towards which the temple was thus aligned would\r\npenetrate the axis of the temple from one end to the other in the\r\noriginal direction of the cord.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Chabas that the Egyptian word which expresses the idea of\r\nfounding or laying the foundation-stone of a temple is _Senti_--a word\r\nwhich still exists in Coptic. But in the old language another word\r\n_Pet-ser_, which no longer remains in Coptic, has been traced. It has\r\nbeen established that _pet_ means to stretch, and _ser_ means cord, so\r\nthat that part of the ceremonial which consisted in stretching a cord in\r\nthe direction of a star was considered of so great an importance that it\r\ngave its name to the whole ceremonial.\r\n\r\nDealing with the existing remains of Egyptian temples, it may be said\r\nthat the most majestic among them was that of Amen-Rā at Karnak,\r\ndedicated to the Sun-God, and oriented to catch the light of the sun\r\nsetting at the summer solstice, the time of the year at which the\r\nall-important rise of the Nile began.\r\n\r\nAlthough the sun is no longer worshipped in Egypt or Britain,\r\nsun-worship has not yet disappeared from the world. Professor Gowland\r\nhas recently[2] brought to notice a surviving form of sun-worship in\r\nJapan. I quote his statement:--\r\n\r\n“There on the seashore at Fûta-mi-ga-ura (as will be seen in a copy of a\r\nprint which I obtained at that ancient place) the orientation of the\r\nshrine of adoration is given by two gigantic rocks which rise from the\r\nsea as natural pillars. The sun as it rises over the mountains of the\r\ndistant shore is observed between them, and the customary prayers and\r\nofferings made in that direction (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n“It is, too, specially worthy of note that the point from which the sun\r\nis revered is marked by a structure of the form of a trilithon, but made\r\nof wood, placed immediately behind the altar. This representative of the\r\ntrilithon is of very remote date in Japan, and has been in use there\r\nfrom the earliest times in connection with the observances of the\r\nancient Shintō cult in which the Sun-Goddess is the chief deity. One of\r\nits important uses, which still survives, was to indicate the direction\r\nof the position of some sacred place or object of veneration, in order\r\nthat worshippers might make their prayers and oblations towards the\r\nproper quarter.”\r\n\r\nThe table of offerings must also be noted.\r\n\r\nIn the book to which I have referred, I also endeavoured to show that a\r\nknowledge of even elementary astronomy may be of very great assistance\r\nto students of archæology, history, folk-lore and all that learning\r\nwhich deals with man’s first attempts to grasp the meaning and phenomena\r\nof the universe in which he found himself before any scientific methods\r\nwere available to him; before he had any idea of the origins or the\r\nconditionings of the things around him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Present sun worship in Japan.]\r\n\r\nIt may be well, however, in the present book to restate the underlying\r\nastronomical principles in the briefest possible manner; and this is the\r\nmore easily done because, in the absence of measuring instruments, the\r\nhorizon was the only circle which the ancient peoples could employ\r\neffectively, and we need only therefore consider it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, whether we regard the Rig-Veda or the Egyptian monuments from an\r\nastronomical point of view, we are struck by the fact that the early\r\nworship and all the early observations related to the horizon. This was\r\ntrue not only for the sun, but for all the stars which studded the\r\ngeneral expanse of sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The celestial sphere, conditions at the North\r\nPole. A parallel sphere. _N.P._, North celestial Pole; _N_, position of\r\nobserver.]\r\n\r\nWe have therefore chiefly to consider the relation of the horizon of any\r\nplace to the apparent movements of celestial bodies at that place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The celestial sphere, conditions at the Equator.\r\nA right sphere. _Q_, standpoint of observer; _PP_, the celestial poles;\r\n_EW_, east and west points.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--The celestial sphere, conditions in a middle\r\nlatitude. An oblique sphere. In this woodcut _DD′_ shows the apparent\r\npath of a circumpolar star; _BB′B″_ the path and rising and setting\r\npoints of an equatorial star; _CC′C″_ and _AA′A″_, those of stars of mid\r\ndeclination, one north and the other south; _O_, standpoint of\r\nobserver.]\r\n\r\nWe now know that the earth rotates on its axis, but this idea was of\r\ncourse quite unknown to these early peoples. Since the earth rotates,\r\nwith stars infinitely removed surrounding it on all sides, the apparent\r\nmovements of the stars will depend very much upon the position we\r\nhappen to occupy on the earth. An observer at the North Pole of the\r\nearth, for instance, would see the stars moving round in circles\r\nparallel to the horizon (Fig. 2). No star could therefore either rise or\r\nset--one half of the heavens would be always visible above his horizon,\r\nand the other half invisible. An observer at the South Pole would of\r\ncourse see that half of the stars invisible to the observer at the\r\nnorthern one.\r\n\r\nIf the observer be on the equator, the movements of the stars will\r\nappear to be as indicated in this diagram (Fig. 3)--that is, all the\r\nstars will rise and set, and each star will be, in turn, twelve hours\r\nabove the horizon, and the same time below it. But if we consider the\r\nposition of an observer in a middle latitude, say at Stonehenge, we find\r\nthat some stars will always be above the horizon, some always\r\nbelow--that is, they will neither rise nor set. All other stars will\r\nboth rise and set, but some of them will be above the horizon for a long\r\ntime and below for a short time, whereas others will be a very short\r\ntime above the horizon and a long time below it, each star completing a\r\ncircle in a day (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nWherever we are upon the earth we always imagine that we are on the top\r\nof it. The idea held by all the early peoples was that the surface of\r\nthe earth near them was an extended plain: they imagined that the land\r\nthat they knew and just the surrounding lands were really in the centre\r\nof the extended plain. Plato, for instance, was content to think the\r\nMediterranean and Greece upon the top of a cube, and Anaximander placed\r\nthe same region at the top of a cylinder.\r\n\r\nBy the use of a terrestrial globe we can best study the conditions of\r\nobservation at the poles of the earth, the equator and some place in\r\nmiddle latitude. The wooden horizon of the globe is parallel to the\r\nhorizon of a place at the top of the globe, which horizon we can\r\nrepresent by a wafer. By inclining the axis of the globe and watching\r\nthe movement of the wafer as the globe is turned round, we can get a\r\nvery concrete idea of the different relations of the observer’s horizon\r\nto the apparent paths of the stars in different latitudes.\r\n\r\nWe have next to deal with the astronomical relations of the horizon of\r\nany place, in connection with the observation of the sun and stars at\r\nthe times of rising or setting, when of course they are on or near the\r\nhorizon; and in order to bring this matter nearer to the ancient\r\nmonuments, we will study this question for both Thebes and Stonehenge.\r\nWe may take the latitude of Thebes as 25°, Stonehenge as 51°, and we\r\nwill begin with Thebes.\r\n\r\nTo consider an observer on the Nile at Thebes and to adjust things\r\nproperly we must rectify a celestial globe to the latitude of 25° N.,\r\nor, in other words, incline the axis of the globe at that angle to the\r\nwooden horizon.\r\n\r\nSince all the stars which pass between the North Pole and the horizon\r\ncannot set, all their apparent movements will take place above the\r\nhorizon. All the stars between the horizon and the South Pole will never\r\nrise. Hence, stars within the distance of 25° from the North Pole will\r\nnever set at Thebes, and those stars within 25° of the South Pole will\r\nnever be visible there. At any place the latitude and the elevation of\r\nthe pole are the same. It so happens that many of those places with\r\nwhich archæologists have to do in studying the history of early\r\npeoples--Chaldæa, Egypt, Babylonia, &c.--are in low middle latitudes,\r\ntherefore we have to deal with bodies in the skies which do set and\r\nbodies which do not, and the elevation of the pole is neither very great\r\nnor very small. But although in each different latitude the inclination\r\nof the equator to the horizon as well as the elevation of the pole will\r\nvary, there will be a strict relationship between the inclination of the\r\nequator at each place and the elevation of the pole. Except at the poles\r\nthemselves the equator will cut the horizon due east and due west;\r\ntherefore every celestial body to the north of the celestial equator\r\nwhich rises and sets will cut the horizon between the east and west\r\npoint and the north point; those bodies which do not rise will of course\r\nnot cut the horizon at all.\r\n\r\nThe stars near the equator, and the sun, in such a latitude as that of\r\nThebes, will appear to rise or set at no very considerable angle from\r\nthe vertical; but when we deal with stars very near to the north or\r\nsouth points of the horizon they will seem to skim along the horizon\r\ninstead of rising directly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now pass on to Stonehenge. To represent the new condition the axis of\r\nthe globe will now require to be inclined 51° to the horizon. The number\r\nof northern stars which do not set and of southern stars which do not\r\nrise will be much greater than at Thebes. The most northern and southern\r\nstars visible will in their movement hug the horizon more closely than\r\nwas observed under the Thebes condition.\r\n\r\nThe sun, both at Thebes and Stonehenge, since it moves among the stars\r\nfrom 23¹⁄₂° N. to 23¹⁄₂° S. each year, will change its place of rising\r\nand setting at different times of the year.\r\n\r\nNow it will at once be obvious that there must be a strict law\r\nconnecting the position of a star with its place of rising or setting.\r\nStars at the same distance from the celestial pole or equator will rise\r\nor set at the same point of the horizon, and if a star does not change\r\nits place in the heavens it will always rise or set in the same place.\r\n\r\nThe sun as it changes its position each day, in its swing N. and S. of\r\nthe equator, will rise and set on any day in the same place as a star\r\nwhich permanently has the same distance from the equator as that\r\ntemporarily occupied by the sun.\r\n\r\nHere it will be convenient to introduce one or two technical terms: we\r\ngenerally define a star’s place by giving, as one ordinate, its distance\r\nin degrees from the equator: this distance is called its _declination_.\r\n\r\nFurther, we generally define points on the horizon by dividing its whole\r\ncircumference into 360°, so that we can have _azimuths_ up to 90° from\r\nthe north and south points to the east and west points. We also have\r\n_amplitudes_ from the east and west points towards the north and south\r\npoints. We can say, then, that a star of a certain declination, or the\r\nsun when it occupies that declination, will rise or set at such an\r\nazimuth, or at such an amplitude. This will apply to both north and\r\nsouth declinations.\r\n\r\nThen supposing the azimuth to be 39° in the N.E. quadrant, it is written\r\nN. 39° E. For the other quadrants we have N. 39° W., S. 39° E., and S.\r\n39° W., respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the amplitudes of rising or setting (north or\r\nsouth) of celestial bodies having declinations from 0° to 64°, at Thebes\r\nand Stonehenge respectively.\r\n\r\nAMPLITUDES AT THEBES AND STONEHENGE.\r\n\r\n  ------------+--------------------\r\n              |     Amplitude.\r\n  Declination.+-------+-----------\r\n              |Thebes.|Stonehenge.\r\n  ------------+-------+-----------\r\n       0°     |  0° 0′|   0° 0′\r\n       1      |  1  7 |   1 36\r\n       2      |  2 13 |   3 11\r\n       3      |  3 20 |   4 46\r\n       4      |  4 26 |   6 22\r\n       5      |  5 33 |   7 58\r\n       6      |  6 40 |   9 34\r\n       7      |  7 47 |  11 10\r\n       8      |  8 53 |  12 47\r\n       9      |  9 59 |  14 23\r\n      10      | 11  6 |  16  1\r\n      11      | 12 13 |  17 39\r\n      12      | 13 20 |  19 18\r\n      13      | 14 27 |  20 57\r\n      14      | 15 34 |  22 36\r\n      15      | 16 41 |  24 17\r\n      16      | 17 49 |  25 58\r\n      17      | 18 56 |  27 45\r\n      18      | 20  3 |  29 24\r\n      19      | 21 10 |  31 10\r\n      20      | 22 17 |  32 55\r\n      21      | 23 25 |  34 43\r\n      22      | 24 33 |  36 32\r\n      23      | 25 41 |  38 23\r\n      24      | 26 49 |  40 16\r\n      25      | 27 58 |  42 11\r\n      26      | 29  6 |  44 10\r\n      27      | 30 15 |  46 10\r\n      28      | 31 23 |  48 15\r\n      29      | 32 32 |  50 22\r\n      30      | 33 41 |  52 36\r\n      31      | 34 51 |  54 55\r\n      32      | 36  1 |  57 21\r\n      33      | 37 11 |  59 56\r\n      34      | 38 21 |  62 42\r\n      35      | 39 31 |  65 44\r\n      36      | 40 42 |  69  4\r\n      37      | 41 53 |  73  0\r\n      38      | 43  5 |  78  4\r\n      39      | 44 17 |  90  0\r\n      40      | 45 30 |\r\n      41      | 46 43 |\r\n      42      | 47 56 |\r\n      43      | 49 10 |\r\n      44      | 50 25 |\r\n      45      | 51 41 |\r\n      46      | 52 57 |\r\n      47      | 54 14 |\r\n      48      | 55 32 |\r\n      49      | 56 51 |\r\n      50      | 58 12 |\r\n      51      | 59 34 |\r\n      52      | 60 58 |\r\n      53      | 62 23 |\r\n      54      | 63 51 |\r\n      55      | 65 21 |\r\n      56      | 66 54 |\r\n      57      | 68 31 |\r\n      58      | 70 12 |\r\n      59      | 71 59 |\r\n      60      | 73 55 |\r\n      61      | 76  1 |\r\n      62      | 78 25 |\r\n      63      | 81 19 |\r\n      64      | 85 42 |\r\n  ------------+-------+------------\r\n\r\nThe amplitude is always the complement of the azimuth, so that amplitude\r\n+ azimuth = 90°.

In the very early\r\nobservations that were made in Egypt, Chaldæa and elsewhere, when the\r\nsun was considered to be a god who every morning got into his boat and\r\nfloated across space, there was no particular reason for considering the\r\namplitude at which the boat left, or came to, shore. But a few centuries\r\nshowed that this rising or setting of the sun in widely varying\r\namplitudes at different times of the year at the same place obeyed a\r\nvery definite law.\r\n\r\nIn its northward passage it reaches the highest point at our summer\r\nsolstice, and then goes down again till it reaches its greatest southern\r\ndeclination, as it does in our winter. At both these points the sun\r\nappears to stand still in its north or south movement, and the Latin\r\nword solstice exactly expresses that idea. The change of declination\r\nbrought about by these movements will affect the place of the sun’s\r\nrising and setting; this is why the sun sets most to the north in\r\nsummer and most to the south in winter. At the equinoxes the sun has\r\nalways 0° Decl., so it rises and sets due east and west all over the\r\nworld. But at the solstices it has its greatest declination of 23¹⁄₂° N.\r\nor S.; it will rise and set therefore furthest from the east and west\r\npoints; how far, will depend upon the latitude of the place, as will\r\nhave been gathered from the preceding table (p. 11).\r\n\r\nThese solstices and their accompaniments are among the striking things\r\nin the natural world. In the winter solstice we have the depth of\r\nwinter, in the summer solstice we have the height of summer, while at\r\nthe equinoxes we have but transitional changes; in other words, while\r\nthe solstices point out for us the conditions of greatest heat and\r\ngreatest cold, the equinoxes point out for us those two times of the\r\nyear at which the temperature conditions are very nearly equal, although\r\nof course in the one case we are saying good-bye to summer and in the\r\nother to winter.\r\n\r\nDid the ancients know anything about these solstices and these\r\nequinoxes? Dealing with the monumental evidence in Egypt alone, the\r\nanswer is absolutely overwhelming. Many thousand years ago the Egyptians\r\nwere perfectly familiar with the solstices, and therefore with the\r\nyearly path of the sun.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental division of the sun’s apparent revolution and course\r\nwhich define our year into four nearly equal parts may be indicated as\r\nin Fig. 5, the highest point reached by the sun in our northern\r\nhemisphere being represented at the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The four Astronomical Divisions of the year.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--The various bearings of the sun risings and\r\nsettings in a place with a N. latitude of 51°.]\r\n\r\nIn order better to consider the problem as it was presented to the early\r\nastronomers who built observatories (temples) to mark these points, we\r\nmay deal with the bearings of the points occupied by the sun on the\r\nhorizon (either at rising or setting) at the times indicated. These\r\npoints are defined, as we have seen, by their “amplitude” or their\r\ndistance in degrees from the E. or W. points of the horizon. In the\r\ndiagram (Fig. 6) I represent the conditions of our chief British\r\nsun-temple, Stonehenge, in latitude 51° N. approximately.\r\n\r\nTaking the astronomical facts regarding the solstices and equinoxes for\r\nthe first year (1901) of the present century, we find--\r\n\r\n  Sun enters Aries,       Spring equinox,  March 21.\r\n   „    „    Gemini,      Summer solstice, June 21.\r\n   „    „    Libra,       Autumn equinox,  September 23.\r\n   „    „    Sagittarius, Winter solstice, December 23.\r\n\r\nThese points, then, are approximately ninety-one days apart (91 × 4 =\r\n364).\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6 I deal with the “amplitudes” at Stonehenge, that is, the\r\nangular distance along the horizon from the E. and W. points, at which\r\nthe sunrise and sunset are seen at the solstices; at the equinoxes they\r\nare seen at the E. and W. points. But as these amplitudes vary with the\r\nlatitude and therefore depend upon the place of observation, a more\r\ngeneral treatment is possible if we deal with the declination of the sun\r\nitself, that is, its angular distance from the equator.\r\n\r\nThe maximum declination depends upon the obliquity of the ecliptic, that\r\nis, the angle between the plane of the ecliptic and that of the equator\r\nat the time of observation. When the Stonehenge Sarsen Stones were\r\nerected this angle was, as I shall show later on, 23° 54′ 30″. Its mean\r\nvalue for the present year (1906) is 23° 27′ 5″; it is decreasing very\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious from Fig. 6 that in temples built to observe the\r\nsolstices or equinoxes, if they were open from end to end, looking in\r\none direction we should see the sun rising at a solstice or equinox, and\r\nlooking in the other we should see the sun setting at the opposite one.\r\nI shall show later on that this statement requires a slight\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nBut temples so built interfered with the ceremonial, which required that\r\nthe light should illuminate a naos--that is, the Sanctuary or Holy of\r\nHolies, only entered by the High Priest, and generally kept dark.\r\nUsually, therefore, two temples were built back to back, with a common\r\naxis, as at Karnak.\r\n\r\nAnd here a very important point comes in; which time of the year and day\r\nof the year are most easy to fix by astronomical observation? As a\r\nmatter of fact the summer solstice, the position of the sun on the\r\nlongest day, is a point easily fixed. All we have to do is to observe\r\nthe sun rising more and more to the north as the summer approaches,\r\nuntil at the very height of the summer we have the extreme\r\nnorth-easterly point of the horizon reached, and the sun stands still.\r\nWe have the solstice. We can then put a row of stakes up, and so fix the\r\nsolstitial line. Of course we find, as mankind has found generally, that\r\nthe sun comes back next year to that same solstitial place of rising or\r\nsetting. So that when we have once got such an alignment for the rising\r\nof the sun at midsummer, we can determine the length of the year in\r\ndays, and therefore the beginning of each year as it comes round.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the chief points in what we may term the astronomical\r\nyear, those at which the sun’s declination is greatest and least. We see\r\nthat they are approximately ninety-one days apart--say three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE AGRICULTURAL DIVISIONS OF THE YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early peoples have been very much misrepresented, and held to have\r\nbeen uninstructed, by several writers who have not considered what they\r\nwere really driving at. It was absolutely essential for early man,\r\nincluding the inhabitants of Britain as it was then--townless,\r\nuncivilised--that the people should know something about the proper time\r\nfor performing their agricultural operations. We now go into a shop and\r\nfor a penny buy an almanack which gives us everything we want to know\r\nabout the year, the month and the day, and that is the reason why so few\r\nof us care about astronomy: we can get all we want from astronomy for a\r\npenny or twopence. But these poor people, unless they found out the time\r\nof the year and the month and the day for themselves, or got some one to\r\ntell them--and their priests were the men who knew, and they were\r\npriests because they knew--had absolutely no means of determining when\r\ntheir various agricultural operations should take place. So that we find\r\nall over the world temples erected in the very first flush of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nOn this a point comes in of very considerable interest. If we study the\r\ncivilisations in Egypt, we find that, so far as we know, one of the\r\nfirst peoples who used this principle of orientation for agricultural\r\npurposes was some tribe that came down the Nile about 6400 years B.C.\r\nThey used the star Canopus, and their determination was that of the\r\nautumnal equinox, which practically was the time when the Nile began to\r\ngo down, and when their sowing might begin. There was another race who,\r\ninstead of being interested in the sun, and therefore in agriculture, at\r\nthe time of the autumnal equinox, were interested in the year about the\r\ntime of Easter as well. This race built the Pyramids about four thousand\r\nyears B.C. There was an interval of about two or three thousand years\r\nbetween these races. As we shall see there were others, who at Thebes\r\nstarted the solstitial worship--that is to say, the worship of the sun\r\nat midsummer--and at Memphis in May, so as to enable them to go on with\r\ntheir agricultural operations with greater certainty. We must not forget\r\nthat first of all the farmers tried to plough and sow by the moon. We\r\ncan see how hopeless agriculture must have been under such conditions.\r\nThe month, indeed, was the only unit of time employed, even of human\r\nlife. We hear of people who lived 1200 years; that means 1200\r\nmonths--there is no question whatever about that now.\r\n\r\nWhen we study the history of our own country--when we come back from\r\nEgypt to Britain, leaving alone Greece and Rome--we find that in various\r\ntimes in our country we have had a year, a farmer’s year, beginning in\r\nthe month of May; we have had another farmer’s year beginning in the\r\nmonth of August; we have had another farmer’s year beginning at the\r\nlongest day; and it appears that the year beginning at the longest day\r\nwas really the last year to be introduced. So that while we have in\r\nStonehenge a solstitial temple--that is to say, a temple to make\r\nobservations of the length of the year by observing the rise of the sun\r\non the longest day of the year--in other parts of England there were\r\nother temples observing the sun, not on the 21st of June, but early in\r\nMay and early in August.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have indicated, the priest-astronomers in these temples could\r\nonly have won and kept the respect of the agricultural population with\r\nwhom alone they were surrounded in early times, and by whom they were\r\nsupported, by being useful to them in some way or another. This could\r\nonly have been in connection with what we may term generally the\r\n_farming_ operations necessary at different times of the year, whether\r\nin the shape of preparing the ground or gathering the produce. For this\r\nthey must have watched the stars.\r\n\r\nA very large part of mythology has sprung out of the temple cults,\r\nprayer, sacrifices and thanksgiving connected with these farming\r\noperations in different lands and ages.\r\n\r\nI wish to show next that by studying the orientation of temples erected\r\nto watch the stars and sunrise and sunset at times other than the\r\nsolstices or equinoxes, an immense amount of information may be gained\r\nif we endeavour to find the way in which the problem must have been\r\nattacked before the year was thoroughly established, and when it was\r\nstill a question of grass- or corn-kings or gods who had to be\r\npropitiated; and we may even be enabled to understand why the particular\r\ndivisions of the year were chosen.\r\n\r\nIn a solstitial temple the sun makes its appearance only once a year,\r\nwhen it reaches its greatest north or south declination; but in the\r\ntemples dealing with lower declinations the sun appears twice, once on\r\nits journey from the summer to the winter solstice, and again on its\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulty of the inquiry in the direction I have indicated\r\narises from the fact that the products of different countries vary, and\r\nthat identical farming operations have to be carried on at different\r\ntimes in these countries. We must, then, begin with some one country,\r\nand as the record is fullest for Greece I will begin with it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we find is that the chief points in the farmer’s year in\r\nGreece are about as far from the fixed points in the astronomical year\r\nas they well can be.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek information so admirably collated by M. Ruelle in the\r\narticle on the calendar in Daremberg and Saglio’s monumental\r\n“Dictionnaire des Antiquités Grecques et Romaines,” the earlier\r\nGregorian dates on which the seasons were reckoned to commence in\r\nancient Greece were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Summer              May 6.\r\n  Autumn (φθινοπωρον) August 11.\r\n  Winter              November 10.\r\n  Spring              February 7.\r\n\r\nI may also add from the same source that in the calendars of the Latins\r\nthe dates become:--\r\n\r\n  Summer              May 9.\r\n  Autumn              August 8.\r\n  Winter              November 9.\r\n  Spring              February 7.\r\n\r\nNow we see at once that these dates are, roughly, half-way between the\r\nsolstices and equinoxes.\r\n\r\nThis, then, at once brings us back to the orientation problem, which was\r\nto fix by means of a temple in the ordinary way dates nearer to these\r\nturning-points in the local farmer’s years than those fixed by the\r\nsolstitial and equinoctial temples.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that it is not merely a question of stately\r\npiles such as Karnak and the Parthenon in populous centres, but of the\r\nhumblest dolmen or stone circle, in scattered agricultural communities,\r\nwhich was as certainly used for orientation purposes, that is, for\r\nrecording the lapse of time at night or return of some season important\r\nto the tiller of the soil. The advent of the season thus determined\r\ncould be announced to outlying districts by fire signals at night.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that any temple, dolmen or cromlech oriented\r\nto a sunrise or sunset at any dates between the solstices will receive\r\nthe sunlight twice a year.\r\n\r\nIf the temple is pointed nearly solstitially the two dates at which the\r\nsun appears in it will be near the solstice; similarly, for a temple\r\npointed nearly equinoctially the dates will be near the equinox; but if\r\nthe ancients wished to divide the ninety-one days’ interval between the\r\nsolstice and equinox, a convenient method of doing this would be to\r\nobserve the sun at the half-time interval, such that the same temple\r\nwould serve on both occasions. This could be done by orienting the\r\ntemple to the sun’s place on the horizon when it had the declination 16°\r\n20′ on its upward and downward journey, or, in other words, was, _in\r\ndays_, half-way between the equinox and solstice. Thus, for the 45 days\r\n\r\n  (   91 days )\r\n  ( = ------- )\r\n  (      2    )\r\n\r\nfrom March 22, we have in--\r\n\r\n  March       9\r\n  April      30\r\n  May         6\r\n            ---\r\n             45\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the non-equinoctial, non-solstitial days of the year\r\nwhen the sun has this declination?\r\n\r\nThey are, in the sun’s journey from the vernal equinox to the summer\r\nsolstice and back again,\r\n\r\n  May 6 and August 8          Sun’s decl. N. 16° 20′.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for the journey to the winter solstice and return we have\r\n\r\n  November 8 and February 4   Sun’s decl. S. 16° 20′.\r\n\r\nWe get, then, a year symmetrical with the astronomical year, which can\r\nbe indicated with it as in Fig. 7; a year roughly halving the intervals\r\nbetween the chief dates of the astronomical year.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the dates shown I have already pointed out that farming\r\noperations would not occur at the same time in different lands; that\r\nploughing and seed time and harvest would vary with crops and latitudes;\r\nand I must now add that when we wish to determine the exact days of the\r\nmonth we have to struggle with all the difficulties introduced by the\r\nvarious systems adopted by different ancient nations to bring together\r\nthe reckoning of months by the moon and of years by the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The astronomical and vegetation divisions of the\r\nyear.]\r\n\r\nIn more recent times there is an additional difficulty owing to the\r\nincomplete reconstruction of the calendar by Julius Cæsar, who gave us\r\nthe Julian year. Thus, while the spring equinox occurred on March 21 at\r\nthe time of the Council of Nice, in 325 A.D., by the year 1751 the\r\ndating of the year on which it took place had slipped back to the 10th.\r\nHence the Act 24 George II. c. 23, by which September 2, 1752, was\r\nfollowed by September 14 instead of by the 3rd, thus regaining the\r\neleven days lost. This change from the so-called “old style” to the “new\r\nstyle” is responsible for a great deal of confusion.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of trouble was the forsaking by the Jews of the solar\r\nyear, with which they commenced, in favour of the Babylonian lunar year,\r\nwhich has been continued for the purposes of worship by Christians,\r\ngiving us “movable feasts” to such an extent that Easter Day, which once\r\ninvariably marked the spring equinox, may vary from March 22 to April\r\n25, and Whit Sunday from May 10 to June 13. It is at once obvious that\r\nno fixed operations of Nature can be indicated by such variable dates as\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nHence in what follows I shall only deal with the months involved; these\r\namply suffice for a general statement, but a discussion as to exact\r\ndates may come later.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the astronomer-priests had (1) to watch the time at\r\nnight by observing a star rising near the north point of the horizon.\r\nThis star would act as a warner of sunrise at some time of the year.\r\n\r\n(2) To watch for the rising or setting of other stars in various\r\nazimuths warning sunrise at the other critical times of the May or\r\nSolstitial years.\r\n\r\n(3) To watch the sunrise and sunset.\r\n\r\n(4) To mark all rising or setting places of the warning stars and sun by\r\nsight-lines from the circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOUS NEW-YEAR DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the astronomical year it may be stated that each solstice\r\nand equinox has in turn in some country or another, and even in the same\r\ncountry at different times, been taken as the beginning of the year.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, to begin with, the following which may be called\r\n_astronomical_ years:--\r\n\r\n  Solstitial   { June        December    June.\r\n  year.        { December    June        December.\r\n\r\n  Equinoctial  { March       September   March.\r\n  year.        { September   March       September.\r\n\r\nNext, if we treat the intermediate points we have found in the same way,\r\nwe have the following _vegetation_ years:--\r\n\r\n  Flower       { May         November    May.\r\n  year.        { November    May         November.\r\n\r\n  Harvest      { August      February    August.\r\n  year.        { February    August      February.\r\n\r\nIt will have been gathered from Fig. 7 that the temples or cromlechs\r\nerected to watch the first sunrise of the May-November-May year could\r\nalso perform the same office for the August-February-August year; and in\r\na stone circle the priests, by looking along the axis almost in an\r\nopposite direction, could note the sunsets marking the completion of the\r\nhalf of the sun’s yearly round in November and February.\r\n\r\nNow to those who know anything of the important contributions of Grimm,\r\nRhŷs, Frazer, and many others we might name, to our knowledge of the\r\nmythology, worships, and customs in the Mediterranean basin and western\r\nEurope, an inspection of the first columns in the above tables will show\r\nthat here we have a common meeting-ground for temple orientation,\r\nvegetation and customs depending on it, religious festivals, and\r\nmythology. From the Egyptian times at least to our own a generic sun-god\r\nhas been specifically commemorated in each of the named months. Generic\r\ncustoms with specific differences are as easily traced in the same\r\nmonths; while generic vegetation with specific representatives proper to\r\nthe season of the year has been so carefully regarded that even\r\nDecember, though without May flowers or August harvests, not to be\r\noutdone, brings forward its offering in the shape of the berries of the\r\nmistletoe and holly.\r\n\r\nAbout the mistletoe there is this difficulty. Innumerable traditions\r\nassociate it with worship and the oak tree. Undoubtedly the year in\r\nquestion was the solstitial year, so that so far as this goes the\r\nassociation is justified. But as a rule the mistletoe does not grow on\r\noaks. This point has been frequently inquired into, especially by Dr.\r\nHenry Ball (_Journal of Botany_, vol. ii. p. 361, 1864) in relation to\r\nthe growth of the plant in Herefordshire, and by a writer in the\r\n_Quarterly Review_ (vol. cxiv.), who spoke of the mistletoe “deserting\r\nthe oak” in modern times and stated, “it is now so rarely found on that\r\ntree as to have led to the suggestion that we must look for the\r\nmistletoe of the Druids, not in the _Viscum album_ of our own trees and\r\norchards, but in the _Loranthus Europaeus_ which is frequently found on\r\noaks in the south of Europe.”\r\n\r\nOn this point I consulted two eminent botanical friends, Mr. Murray, of\r\nthe British Museum, and Prof. Farmer, from whom I have learned that the\r\ndistribution of _V. album_ is in Europe universal except north of Norway\r\nand north of Russia; in India in the temperate Himalayas from Kashmir to\r\nNepaul, altitude 3000 to 7000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe _Viscum aureum_, otherwise called _Loranthus Europaeus_, is a near\r\nrelation of the familiar mistletoe, and in Italy grows on the oak almost\r\nexclusively. There are fifty species of Loranthus in the Indian flora,\r\nbut _L. Europaeus_ does not occur.\r\n\r\nIn the _Viscum aureum_ we have the “golden bough,” the oak-borne _Aurum\r\nfrondens_ and _Ramus aureus_ of Virgil; and it can easily be imagined\r\nthat when the Druids reached our shores from a country which had\r\nsupplied them with the _Viscum aureum_, this would be replaced by the\r\n_V. album_ growing chiefly on apple trees and not on oaks; indeed, Mr.\r\nDavies, in his “Celtic Researches,” tells us that the apple was the next\r\nsacred tree to the oak, and that apple orchards were planted in the\r\nvicinity of the sacred groves. The transplanting of the mistletoe from\r\nthe apple to the oak tree before the mystic ceremonies began was not\r\nbeyond the resources of priestcraft.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that these ceremonies took place at both\r\nsolstices--once in June, when the oak was in full leaf, and again in\r\nDecember, when the parasitic plant was better visible in the light of\r\nthe young moon. Mr. Frazer, in his “Golden Bough” (iii. p. 328), points\r\nout that at the summer solstice not only was mistletoe gathered, but\r\nmany other “magic plants, whose evanescent virtue can be secured at this\r\nmystic season alone.”\r\n\r\nIt is the ripening of the berries at the winter solstice which secured\r\nfor the mistletoe the paramount importance the ceremonials connected\r\nwith it possessed at that time, when the rest of the vegetable world was\r\ndormant.\r\n\r\nWith regard especially to the particular time of the year chosen for\r\nsun-worship and the worship of the gods and solar heroes connected with\r\nthe years to which I have referred, I may add that the vague year in\r\nEgyptian chronology makes it a very difficult matter to determine the\r\nexact Gregorian dates for the ancient Egyptian festivals, but,\r\nfortunately, there is another way of getting at them. Mr. Roland\r\nMitchell, when compiling his valuable “Egyptian Calendar” (Luzac and\r\nCo., 1900), found that the Koptic calendar really presents to us the old\r\nEgyptian year, “which has been in use for thousands of years, and has\r\nsurvived all the revolutions.”\r\n\r\nOf the many festivals included in the calendar, the great Tanta fair,\r\nwhich is also a Mohammedan feast. “is the most important of all held in\r\nEgypt. Religion, commerce, and pleasure offer combined attractions.” As\r\nmany as 600,000 or 700,000 often attend this great fair, “no doubt the\r\nsurvival of one of the ancient Egyptian national festivals.”\r\n\r\nIt is held so as to end on a Friday, and in 1901 the Friday was August\r\n9!\r\n\r\nThis naturally suggests that we should look for a feast in the early\r\npart of May. We find the Festival of Al-Khidr, or Elias in the middle of\r\nthe wheat harvest in Lower Egypt; of this we read:--\r\n\r\n“Al-Khidr is a mysterious personage, who, according to learned opinion,\r\nwas a just man, or saint, the Visīr of Dhu’l-Karnên (who was a great\r\nconqueror, contemporary with Ibrahīm--Abraham--and identified in other\r\nlegends with Alexander the Great, St. George, &c.). Al-Khidr, it is\r\nbelieved, still lives, and will live until the Day of Judgment. He is\r\nclad in green garments, whence probably the name. He is commonly\r\nidentified with Elias (Elijah), and this confusion seems due to a\r\nconfusion or similarity of some of the attributes that tradition assigns\r\nto both.”\r\n\r\n“The ‘Festival of El-Khidr and of Elias,’ falling generally on May 6,\r\nmarks the two-fold division of the year, in the Turkish and Armenian\r\ncalendars, into the Rūz Kāsim and the Rūz Khidr (of 179-80 and 185-6\r\ndays respectively).”\r\n\r\nThis last paragraph is important, as it points to ancient sun-worship,\r\nHelios being read for Elias; and 179 days from May 6 bring us to\r\nNovember 1. So we find that the modern Turks and Armenians have the old\r\nMay-November year as well as the ancient Egyptians who celebrated it in\r\nthe Temple of Menu at Thebes.\r\n\r\nThe traces of the Ptah worship are not so obvious. Finally, it may be\r\nstated that the second Tanta fair occurs at the spring equinox, so that\r\nthe pyramid worship can still be traced in the modern Egyptian\r\ncalendar. The proof that this was an exotic[3] is established, I think,\r\nby the fact that no important agricultural operations occur at this\r\nperiod in Egypt, while in May we have the harvest, in August and\r\nNovember sowing, going on.\r\n\r\nA cursory examination of Prof. Rhŷs’ book containing the Hibbert\r\nLectures of 1886, in the light of these years, used as clues, suggests\r\nthat in Ireland the sequence was May-November (Fomori and Fir Bolg),\r\nAugust-February (Lug and the Tuatha Dé Danann), and, lastly,\r\nJune-December (Cúchulainn). Should this be confirmed we see that the\r\nfarmers’ years were the first to be established, and it is interesting\r\nto note that the agricultural rent year in many parts of Ireland still\r\nruns from May to November. It is well also to bear in mind, if it be\r\nestablished that the solstitial year did really arrive last, that the\r\nfacts recorded by Mr. Frazer in his “Golden Bough” indicate that the\r\ncustom of lighting fires on hills has been in historic times most\r\nprevalent at the summer solstice; evidently maps showing the\r\ngeographical distribution of the May, June, and August fires would be of\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\nSome customs of the May and August years are common to the solstitial\r\nand equinoctial years. Each was ushered in by fires on hills and the\r\nlike; flowers in May and the fruits of the earth in August are\r\nassociated with them; there are also special customs in the case of\r\nNovember. In western Europe, however, it does not seem that such\r\ntraditions exist over such a large area as that over which the remnants\r\nof the solstitial practices have been traced.\r\n\r\nI have pointed out that both the May and August years began when the sun\r\nhad the same declination (16° N. or thereabouts); once, on its ascent\r\nfrom March to the summer solstice in June, again in its decline from the\r\nsolstice to September. Hence it may be more difficult in this case to\r\ndisentangle and follow the mythology, but the two years stand out here\r\nand there. With regard to August, Mr. Penrose’s orientation data for the\r\nPanathenæa fix the 19th day (Gregorian) for the festival in the\r\nHecatompedon; similar celebrations were not peculiar to western Europe\r\nand Greece, as a comparison of dates of worship will show.\r\n\r\n  Hecatompedon                            April 28 and August 16.\r\n  Older Erechtheum                        April 29  „  August 13.\r\n  Temple of Diana, Ephesus                April 29  „  August 13.\r\n      „     Min, Thebes                   May    1  „  August 12.\r\n      „     Ptah, Memphis                 April 18  „  August 24.\r\n      „       „   Annu                    April 18  „  August 24.\r\n      „     Solar Disc, Tell el-Amarna    April 18  „  August 24.\r\n\r\nIn the above table I have given both the dates on which the sunlight (at\r\nrising or setting) entered the temple, but we do not know for certain,\r\nexcept in the case of the Hecatompedon, on which of the two days the\r\ntemples were used; it is likely they were all used on both days, and\r\nthat the variation from the dates proper to the sun’s declination of N.\r\n16° indicates that they were very accurately oriented to fit the local\r\nvegetation conditions in the most important and extensive temple fields\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThis is the more probable because the Jews also, after they had left\r\nEgypt, established their feast of Pentecost fifty days after Easter =\r\nMay 10, on which day loaves made of newly harvested corn formed the\r\nchief offering.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the equinoctial year, the most complete account of the\r\ntemple arrangements is to be found in Josephus touching that at\r\nJerusalem. The temple had to be so erected that at the spring equinox\r\nthe sunrise light should fall on, and be reflected to, the worshippers\r\nby the sardonyx stones on the high priest’s garment. At this festival\r\nthe first barley was laid upon the altar.\r\n\r\nBut this worship was in full swing in Egypt for thousands of years\r\nbefore we hear of it in connection with the Jews. It has left its\r\ntemples at Ephesus, Athens, and other places, and with the opening of\r\nthis year as well as of the solstitial one the custom of lighting fires\r\nis associated, not only on hills, but also in churches.\r\n\r\nHere the sequence of cult cannot be mistaken. We begin with Isis and the\r\nyoung Sun-god Horus at the Pyramids, and we end with “Lady Day,” a\r\nBritish legal date; while St. Peter’s at Rome is as truly oriented to\r\nthe equinox as the Pyramids themselves, so that we have a distinct\r\nchange of cult with no change of orientation.\r\n\r\nIf such considerations as these help us to connect Egyptian with British\r\nworships we may hope that they will be no less useful when we go further\r\nafield. I gather from a study of Mr. Maudslay’s admirable plans of\r\nPalenque and Chichén-Itzá that the solstitial and farmers’ years’\r\nworships were provided for there. How did these worships and associated\r\ntemples with naos and sphinxes[4] get from Egypt to Yucatan? The more we\r\nknow of ancient travel the more we are convinced that it was coastwise,\r\nthat is, from one point of visible land to the next. Are the cults as\r\nold as differences in the coast-lines which would most easily explain\r\ntheir wide distribution?\r\n\r\n[3] In Babylonia the spring equinox was the critical time of the year\r\nbecause the Tigris and Euphrates then began to rise.\r\n\r\n[4] See _Dawn of Astronomy_, Plate facing p. 182, for the lines of\r\nsphinxes at Karnak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS AND TRADITIONS AT STONEHENGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Penrose, by his admirable observations in Greece, had shown\r\nthat the orientation theory accounted as satisfactorily for the\r\ndirections in which the chief temples in Greece had been built as I had\r\nshown it did for some in Egypt, it seemed important to apply the same\r\nmethods of inquiry with all available accuracy to some example, at all\r\nevents, of the various stone circles in Britain which have so far\r\nescaped destruction. Many attempts had been previously made to secure\r\ndata, but the instruments and methods employed did not seem to be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nMuch time has, indeed, been lost in the investigation of a great many of\r\nthese circles, for the reason that in many cases the relations of the\r\nmonuments to the chief points of the horizon have not been considered;\r\nand when they were, the observations were made only with reference to\r\nthe magnetic north, which is different at different places, and besides\r\nis always varying; few indeed have tried to get at the astronomical\r\nconditions of the problem.\r\n\r\nThe first, I think, was Mr. Jonathan Otley, who in 1849 showed the\r\n“Orientation” of the Keswick Circle “according to the solar meridian,”\r\ngiving true solar bearings throughout the year.\r\n\r\nI wrote a good deal in _Nature_[5] on sun and star temples in 1891, and\r\nMr. Lewis the next year expressed the opinion that the British Stone\r\nMonuments, or some of them, were sun and star temples.\r\n\r\nMr. Magnus Spence of Deerness in Orkney published a pamphlet, “Standing\r\nStones and Maeshowe of Stenness,[6]” in 1894; it is a reprint of an\r\narticle in the _Scottish Review_, Oct. 1893. Mr. Cursiter, F.S.A., of\r\nKirkwall, in a letter to me dated 15 March 1894, a letter suggested by\r\nmy _Dawn of Astronomy_ which appeared in that year and in which the\r\narticles which had appeared in _Nature_ in 1891 had been expanded, drew\r\nmy attention to the pamphlet; the observations had no pretension to\r\nscientific accuracy, and although some of the sight-lines were\r\nincorrectly shown in an accompanying map, May year and solstitial\r\nalignments were indicated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, there has never been a complete inquiry into the stone\r\ncircles in Britain, but Mr. Lewis, who has paid great attention to these\r\nmatters, has dealt in a general manner with them (_Archaeological\r\nJournal_, vol. xlix. p. 136), and has further described (_Journal_\r\nAnthropological Institute, n.s., iii., 1900) the observations made by\r\nhim of stone circles in various parts of Scotland. From an examination\r\nof the latter he concludes that they may be divided into different\r\ntypes, each of which has its centre in a different locality. The types\r\nare--(1) the Western Scottish type, consisting of a rather irregular\r\nsingle ring or sometimes of two concentric rings; (2) the Inverness\r\ntype, consisting of a more regular ring of better-shaped stones,\r\nsurrounding a tumulus with a retaining wall, containing a built-up\r\nchamber and passage leading to it, or a kist without a passage; (3) the\r\nAberdeen type, consisting of a similar ring with the addition of a\r\nso-called “altar-stone” and usually having traces of a tumulus and kist\r\nin the middle. In addition to these three types of circles, there are in\r\nBritain generally what Mr. Lewis calls sun and star circles, with their\r\nalignments of stones, and apparently proportioned measurements. He has\r\nshown that there is a great preponderance of outlying stones and\r\nhill-tops lying between the circles and the N.E. quarter of the horizon.\r\nFrom what has been stated in Chapter III with regard to the nightly\r\nobservations of stars it will be gathered that these may have been used\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following list gives some of the bearings of outlying stones and\r\nother circles from the centres of the named circles:--\r\n\r\n  Roll-rich, Oxon.--Kingstone                   N. 27°   E.\r\n  Stripple Stones, Cornwall--Bastion on bank    N. 26    E.\r\n  Long Meg, Cumberland--Small circle            N. 27    E.\r\n  The Hurlers, Cornwall--Two outlying circles   N. 13-16 E.\r\n  Trippet Stones--Leaze circle                  N. 11    E.\r\n\r\nIf these alignments mean anything they must of course refer to the\r\nrising of _stars_, as the position on the horizon is outside the sun’s\r\npath.\r\n\r\nThe many circles in Cornwall have been dealt with by Mr. Lukis in a\r\nvolume published by the Society of Antiquaries in 1895.[7] A carefully\r\nprepared list of circles will be found in Mr. Windle’s recently\r\npublished work entitled “Remains of the Prehistoric Age in England.”\r\n\r\nIt may be useful here to state, with regard to megalithic remains\r\ngenerally, that they may be classed as follows; some details will be\r\ndiscussed later on.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Circles. These may be single, double, or multiple, and either\r\nconcentric or not.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Menhirs, large single stones, used to mark sight-lines from\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Alignments, _i.e._, lines of stones in single, double, or in many\r\nparallel lines. If these alignments are short they are termed avenues.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Holed-stones, doubtless used for observing sight-lines, sometimes\r\n_over_ a circle.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Coves. A term applied by Dr. Stukeley and others to what they\r\nconsidered shrines formed by three upright stones, thus leaving one side\r\nopen. I take them to be partially protected observing places. There are\r\nwell-marked examples at Avebury, Stanton Drew and Kit’s Coity House.\r\n\r\n(_f_) Cromlechs. This term generally means a grouping of upright stones;\r\nit is applied to irregular circles in Brittany. It also applies to a\r\nstone or stones raised on the summits of three or more pillar stones\r\nforming the end and sides of an irregular vault generally open at one\r\nend (“Dolmens of Ireland,” Borlase, p. 429). The top stone is called in\r\nS.W. England a “quoit.” Cromlechs in most cases have been covered by\r\nbarrows or cairns.\r\n\r\n(_g_) Dolmens, from Dol Men, a table stone. These consist of stones,\r\nresting on two or more upright stones forming a more or less complete\r\nchamber, some of which are of great length. I note the following\r\nsubdivisions: “Dolmen à galerie” having an entrance way of sufficient\r\nheight, and “Galgal,” similar but smaller. In the “Dolmen à l’allée\r\ncouverte” there is a covered passage way to the centre. It is a more\r\nelaborate cove. For the relation between cromlechs and dolmens, see\r\nBorlase (_loc. cit._ and p. 424 _et seq._).\r\n\r\nWith regard to dolmens, I give the following quotation from Mr. Penrose\r\n(_Nature_, vol. lxiv., September 12, 1901):--\r\n\r\n“Near Locmariaquer in the estuary named Rivière d’Auray, there is an\r\nisland named Gavr’ Inis, or Goat Island, which contains a good specimen\r\nof the kind of dolmen which has been named ‘Galgal.’\r\n\r\n“At the entrance our attention is at once arrested by the profusion of\r\ntracery which covers the walls. From the entrance to the wall facing us\r\nthe distance is between 50 and 60 feet. The square chamber to which the\r\ngallery leads is composed of two huge slabs, the sides of the room and\r\ngallery being composed of upright stones, about a dozen on each side.\r\nThe mystic lines and hieroglyphics similar to those above mentioned\r\nappear to have a decorative character.\r\n\r\n“An interesting feature of Gavr’ Inis is its remarkable resemblance to\r\nthe New Grange tumulus at Meath. In construction there is again a\r\nstrong resemblance to Mæs-Howe, in the island of Orkney. There is also\r\nsome resemblance in smaller details.”\r\n\r\nWhile we generally have circles in Britain without, or with small,\r\nalignments; in Brittany we have alignments without circles, some of them\r\nbeing on an enormous scale;[8] thus at Menec (the place of stones) we\r\nhave eleven lines of menhirs, terminating towards the west in a\r\ncromlech, and, notwithstanding that great numbers have been converted to\r\nother uses, 1169 menhirs still remain, some reaching as much as 18 feet\r\nin height.\r\n\r\nThe alignments of Kermario (the place of the dead) contain 989 menhirs\r\nin ten lines. Those of Kerlescant (the place of burning), which\r\nbeginning with eleven rows are afterwards increased to thirteen, contain\r\naltogether 579 stones and thirty-nine in the cromlech, with some\r\nadditional stones. The adoration paid these stones yielded very slowly\r\nto Christianity. In the church history of Brittany the _Cultus Lapidum_\r\nwas denounced in 658 A.D.\r\n\r\nMany of the fallen menhirs in these alignments have been restored to\r\ntheir upright position by the French Government. Some of them may have\r\nbeen overturned in compliance with the decree of 658 A.D. above referred\r\nto. Several of the loftier menhirs are surmounted by crosses of stone or\r\niron.\r\n\r\nBoth circles and alignments are associated with holidays and the\r\nlighting of fires on certain days of the year. This custom has remained\r\nmore general in Brittany than in Britain. At Mount St. Michael, near\r\nCarnac, the custom still prevails of lighting a large bonfire on its\r\nsummit at the time of the summer solstice; others, kindled on prominent\r\neminences for a distance of twenty or thirty miles round, reply to it.\r\nThese fires are locally called “Tan Heol,” and also by a later use, Tan\r\nSt. Jean. In Scotland there was a similar custom in the first week in\r\nMay under the name of Bel Tan, or Baal’s Fire; the synonym for summer\r\nused by Sir Walter Scott in the “Lady of the Lake”:--\r\n\r\n  Ours is no sapling chance-sown by the fountain,\r\n  Blooming at Beltane in winter to fade.\r\n\r\nAt Kerlescant the winter solstice is celebrated by a holiday, whilst\r\nMenec greets the summer solstice, and Kermario the equinoxes, with\r\nfestivals. Concerning these fires and the associated customs Mr.\r\nFrazer’s “Golden Bough” is a perfect mine of information and should be\r\nconsulted. It may simply be said here that the May and November, and\r\nJune and December fires seem to be the most ancient. It is stated that\r\nthe Balder bale fires on Mayday Eve were recognised by the primitive\r\nrace, and I shall prove this in the sequel when British customs are\r\nreferred to. On the introduction of Christianity the various customs\r\nwere either transferred to or reorganised in association with church\r\nfestivals; but as some of these, such as Easter, are movable feasts, it\r\nis difficult to follow the dates.\r\n\r\nRegarding both circles and alignments in the light of the orientation\r\ntheory, we may consider simple circles with a central stone as a\r\ncollection of sight-lines from the central stone to one or more of the\r\nouter ones, or the interval between any two; indicating the place of the\r\nrise or setting of either the sun or a star on some particular day of\r\nthe year, which day, in the case of the sun, will be a new year’s day.\r\n\r\nAlignments, on the other hand, will play the same part as the\r\nsight-lines in the circles.\r\n\r\nSometimes the sight-line may be indicated by a menhir outside, and even\r\nat a considerable distance from, the circle; later on tumuli replaced\r\nmenhirs.\r\n\r\nThe dolmens have, I am convinced, been in many cases not graves\r\noriginally, but darkened observing places whence to observe along a\r\nsight-line; this would be best done by means of an _allée couverte_, the\r\npredecessor of the darkened naos at Stonehenge, shielded by its covered\r\ntrilithons.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain some measurements to test the orientation theory in\r\nBritain, I found that Stonehenge is the ancient monument in this country\r\nwhich lends itself to accurate theodolite work better than any other.\r\nMr. Spence’s excellent work on astronomical lines at Stenness, where the\r\nstones, till some years ago at all events, have been more respected than\r\nfurther south, suggested a beginning there, but the distance from London\r\nmade it impossible.\r\n\r\nAvebury and Stanton Drew are well known to a great many archæologists;\r\nthere are also other very wonderful stone circles near Keswick and in\r\nother parts of England; but unfortunately it is very much more difficult\r\nto get astronomical data from these ancient monuments than it is in the\r\ncase of Stonehenge, one reason being that Stonehenge itself lies high,\r\nand the horizon round it in all directions is pretty nearly the same\r\nheight, so that the important question of the heights of the hills along\r\nthe sight-line--a matter which is fundamental from an astronomical point\r\nof view, although it has been neglected, so far as I can make out, by\r\nmost who have made observations on these ancient monuments--is quite a\r\nsimple one at Stonehenge. Hence it was much easier to determine a date\r\nthere than by working at any of the other ancient remains to which I\r\nhave referred.\r\n\r\nIn orientation generally--such orientation as has been dealt with by Mr.\r\nPenrose and myself in Egypt and in Greece--the question frequently was a\r\nchange in direction in the axis of a temple, or the laying down of the\r\naxis of a temple, by means of observations of stars. Unfortunately for\r\nus as archæologists, not as astronomers, the changes of position of the\r\nstars, owing to certain causes, chiefly the precessional movement, are\r\nvery considerable; so that if a temple pointed to a star in one year, in\r\ntwo or three hundred years it would no longer point to the same star,\r\nbut to another.\r\n\r\nThese star observations were requisite in order to warn the priests\r\nabout an hour before sunrise so that they might prepare for the morning\r\nsacrifice which always took place at the first appearance of the sun.\r\nHence the morning star to be visible in the dawn must be a bright one,\r\nand the further north or south of the sun’s rising place it rose, the\r\nmore easily it would be seen. Some stars so chosen rose not far from\r\nthe north point of the horizon. The alignments with small azimuths\r\nreferred to in the British circles (p. 36) I believe to be connected\r\nwith the Egyptian and Greek practice.\r\n\r\nActing on a very old tradition, some people from Salisbury and other\r\nsurrounding places go to observe the sunrise on the longest day of the\r\nyear at Stonehenge. We therefore are perfectly justified in assuming\r\nthat it was a solar temple used for observation in the height of\r\nmidsummer. But at dawn in midsummer in these latitudes the sky is so\r\nbright that it is not easy to see stars even if we get up in the morning\r\nto look for them; stars, therefore, were not in question, so that some\r\nother principle had to be adopted, and that was to point the temple\r\ndirectly to the position on the horizon at which the sun rose on that\r\nparticular day of the year, and no other.\r\n\r\nNow, if there were no change in the position of the sun, that, of\r\ncourse, would go on for ever and ever; but, fortunately for\r\narchæologists, there is a slight change in the position of the sun, as\r\nthere is in the case of a star, but for a different reason; the planes\r\nof the ecliptic and of the equator undergo a slight change in the angle\r\nincluded between them. So far as we know, that angle has been gradually\r\ngetting less for many thousands of years, so that, in the case of\r\nStonehenge, if we wish to determine the date, having no stars to help\r\nus, the only thing that we can hope to get any information from is the\r\nvery slow change of this angle; that, therefore, was the special point\r\nwhich Mr. Penrose and I were anxious to study at Stonehenge, for the\r\nreason that we seemed in a position to do it there more conveniently\r\nthan anywhere else in Britain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--The original tooling of the stone protected from\r\nthe action of the weather.]\r\n\r\nBut while the astronomical conditions are better at Stonehenge than\r\nelsewhere, the ruined state of the monument makes accurate measurements\r\nvery difficult.\r\n\r\nGreat age and the action of weather are responsible for much havoc, so\r\nthat very many of the stones are now recumbent, as will be gathered from\r\nan article by Mr. Lewis, who described the condition of the monument in\r\n1901, in _Man_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--View of Stonehenge from the west. A, stone which\r\nfell in 1900; _BB_, stones which fell in 1797. (Reproduced from an\r\narticle on the fallen stones by Mr. Lewis in _Man_.)]\r\n\r\nProfessor Gowland in his excavations at Stonehenge, to which I shall\r\nrefer in the sequel, found the original tooled surface near the bottom\r\nof one of the large sarsens which had been protected from the action of\r\nthe weather by having been buried in the ground. It enables us to\r\nimagine the appearance of the monument as it left the hands of the\r\nbuilders (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Copy of Hoare’s plan of 1810, showing the\r\nunbroken Vallum and its relation with the Avenue.]\r\n\r\nBut the real destructive agent has been man himself; savages could not\r\nhave played more havoc with the monument than the English who have\r\nvisited it at different times for different purposes. It is said the\r\nfall of one great stone was caused in 1620 by some excavations, but this\r\nhas been doubted; the fall of another in 1797 was caused by gipsies\r\ndigging a hole in which to shelter, and boil their kettle; many of the\r\nstones have been used for building walls and bridges; masses weighing\r\nfrom 56 lb. downwards have been broken off by hammers or cracked off as\r\na result of fires lighted by excursionists.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the temenos wall or vallum, which is shown complete in\r\nHoare’s plan of 1810, is now broken down in many places by vehicles\r\nindiscriminately driven over it. Indeed, its original importance has now\r\nbecome so obliterated that many do not notice it as part of the\r\nstructure--that, in fact, it bears the same relation to the interior\r\nstone circle as the nave of St. Paul’s does to the Lady Chapel (Fig.\r\n10).\r\n\r\nIt is within the knowledge of all interested in archæology that not long\r\nago Sir Edmund Antrobus, the owner of Stonehenge, advised by the famous\r\nWiltshire local society, the Society for the Protection of Ancient\r\nBuildings, and the Society of Antiquaries, enclosed the monument in\r\norder to preserve it from further wanton destruction, and--a first step\r\nin the way of restoration--with the skilled assistance of Prof. Gowland\r\nand Messrs. Carruthers, Detmar Blow and Stallybrass, set upright the\r\nmost important menhir, which threatened to fall or else break off at one\r\nof the cracks. This menhir, the so-called “leaning stone,” once formed\r\none of the uprights of the trilithon the fall of the other member of\r\nwhich is stated by Mr. Lewis to have occurred before 1574. The latter,\r\nbroken in two pieces, and the supported impost, now lie prostrate\r\nacross the altar stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Leaning Stone in 1901.]\r\n\r\nThis piece of work was carried out with consummate skill and care, and\r\nmost important conclusions, as we shall see in a subsequent chapter,\r\nwere derived from the minute inquiry into the conditions revealed in the\r\nexcavations which were necessary for the proper conduct of the work.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that we have heard the last of the work of devastators, and\r\neven that, before long, some of the other larger stones, now inclined or\r\nprostrate, may be set upright.\r\n\r\nSince Sir Edmund Antrobus, the present owner, has acted on the advice of\r\nthe societies I have named to enclose the monument, with a view to guard\r\nit from destruction and desecration, he has been assailed on all sides.\r\nIt is not a little surprising that the “unclimbable wire fence”\r\nrecommended by the societies in question (the Bishop of Bristol being\r\nthe president of the Wiltshire society at the time) is by some regarded\r\nas a suggestion that the property is not national, the fact being that\r\nthe nation has not bought the property, and that it has been private\r\nproperty for centuries, and treated in the way we have seen.\r\n\r\nLet us hope also that before long the gaps in the vallum may be filled\r\nup. These, as I have already stated, take away from the meaning of an\r\nimportant part of one of the most imposing monuments of the world. In\r\nthe meantime, it is comforting to know that, thanks to what Sir Edmund\r\nAntrobus has done, no more stones will be stolen, or broken by\r\nsledge-hammers; that fires; that excavations such as were apparently the\r\nprime cause of the disastrous fall of one of the majestic trilithons in\r\n1797; that litter, broken bottles and the like, with which too many\r\nBritish sightseers mark their progress, besides much indecent\r\ndesecration, are things of the past.\r\n\r\nIf Stonehenge had been built in Italy, or France, or Germany, it would\r\nhave been in charge of the State long ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI now pass from the monument itself to a reference to some of the\r\ntraditions and historical statements concerning it.\r\n\r\nThose who are interested in these matters should thank the Wiltshire\r\nArchæological and Natural History Society, which is to be warmly\r\ncongratulated on its persistent and admirable efforts to do all in its\r\npower to enable the whole nation to learn about the venerable monuments\r\nof antiquity which it has practically taken under its scientific charge.\r\nIt has published two most important volumes[9] dealing specially with\r\nStonehenge, including both its traditions and history.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Mr. Long’s memoir, it may be stated that it includes\r\nimportant extracts from notices of Stonehenge from the time of Henry of\r\nHuntingdon (twelfth century) to Hoare (1812), and that all extant\r\ninformation is given touching on the questions by whom the stones were\r\nerected, whence they came, and what was the object of the structure.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Harrison’s more recently published bibliography, no reference\r\nto Stonehenge by any ancient author, no letter to the _Times_ for the\r\nlast twenty years dealing with any question touching the monuments,\r\nseems to be omitted.\r\n\r\nIt is very sad to read, both in Mr. Long’s volume and the bibliography,\r\nof the devastation which has been allowed to go on for so many years and\r\nof the various forms it has taken.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs almost the whole of the notes which follow deal with the assumption\r\nof Stonehenge having been a solar temple, a short reference to the\r\nearliest statements concerning this view is desirable; and, again, as\r\nthe approximate date arrived at by Mr. Penrose and myself in 1901 is an\r\nearly one, a few words may be added indicating the presence in Britain\r\nat that time of a race of men capable of designing and executing such\r\nwork. I quote from the paper communicated by Mr. Penrose and myself to\r\nthe Royal Society:--\r\n\r\n“As to the first point, Diodorus Siculus (ii., 47, ed. Didot, p. 116)\r\nhas preserved a statement of Hecatæus in which Stonehenge alone can by\r\nany probability be referred to.\r\n\r\n“‘We think that no one will consider it foreign to our subject to say a\r\nword respecting the Hyperboreans.\r\n\r\n“‘Amongst the writers who have occupied themselves with the mythology of\r\nthe ancients, Hecatæus and some others tell us that opposite the land of\r\nthe Celts [ἑν τοις ἁντιπεραν της Κελτικης τοποις] there exists in the\r\nOcean an island not smaller than Sicily, and which, situated under the\r\nconstellation of The Bear, is inhabited by the Hyperboreans; so called\r\nbecause they live beyond the point from which the North wind blows....\r\nIf one may believe the same mythology, Latona was born in this island,\r\nand for that reason the inhabitants honour Apollo more than any other\r\ndeity. A sacred enclosure [νησον] is dedicated to him in the island, as\r\nwell as a magnificent circular temple adorned with many rich\r\nofferings.... The Hyperboreans are in general very friendly to the\r\nGreeks.’”\r\n\r\n“The Hecatæus above referred to was probably Hecatæus of Abdera, in\r\nThrace, fourth century B.C.; a friend of Alexander the Great. This\r\nHecatæus is said to have written a history of the Hyperboreans: that it\r\nwas Hecatæus of Miletus, an historian of the sixth century B.C., is less\r\nlikely.\r\n\r\n“As to the second point, although we cannot go so far back in evidence\r\nof the power and civilisation of the Britons, there is an argument of\r\nsome value to be drawn from the fine character of the coinage issued by\r\nBritish kings early in the second century B.C., and from the statement\r\nof Julius Cæsar (‘De Bello Gallico,’ vi., c. 14) that in the schools of\r\nthe Druids the subjects taught included the movements of the stars, the\r\nsize of the earth, and the nature of things (multa præterea de sideribus\r\net eorum motu, de mundi magnitudine, de rerum natura, de deorum\r\nimmortalium vi ac potestate disputant et juventuti tradunt).\r\n\r\n“Studies of such a character seem quite consistent with, and to demand,\r\na long antecedent period of civilisation.”\r\n\r\nHenry of Huntingdon is the first English writer to refer to Stonehenge,\r\nwhich he calls Stanenges. Geoffrey of Monmouth (1138) and Giraldus\r\nCambrensis come next.\r\n\r\nIn 1771, Dr. John Smith, in a work entitled “Choir Gawr, the Grand\r\nOrrery of the Ancient Druids, called Stonehenge, Astronomically\r\nExplained, and proved to be a Temple for Observing the Motions of the\r\nHeavenly Bodies,” wrote as follows:--\r\n\r\n“From many and repeated visits, I conceived it to be an astronomical\r\ntemple; and from what I could recollect to have read of it, no author\r\nhad as yet investigated its uses. Without an instrument or any\r\nassistance whatever, but White’s ‘Ephemeris,’ I began my survey. I\r\nsuspected the stone called _The Friar’s Heel_ to be the index that would\r\ndisclose the uses of this structure; nor was I deceived. This stone\r\nstands in a right line with the centre of the temple, pointing to the\r\nnorth-east. I first drew a circle round the vallum of the ditch and\r\ndivided it into 360 equal parts; and then a right line through the body\r\nof the temple to the Friar’s Heel; at the intersection of these lines I\r\nreckoned the sun’s greatest amplitude at the summer solstice, in this\r\nlatitude, to be about 60 degrees, and fixed the eastern points\r\naccordingly. Pursuing this plan, I soon discovered the uses of all the\r\ndetached stones, as well as those that formed the body of the temple.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to this “Choir Gawr,” translated Chorea Gigantum, Leland’s\r\nopinion is quoted (Long, p. 51) that we should read Choir vawr, the\r\nequivalent of which is Chorea nobilis or magna.[10]\r\n\r\nIn spite of Inigo Jones’s (1600) dictum that Stonehenge was of Roman\r\norigin, Stukeley came to the conclusion in 1723 that the Druids were\r\nresponsible for its building; and Halley, who visited it in\r\n1720--probably with Stukeley--concluded from the weathering of the\r\nstones that it was at least 3000 years old; if he only had taken his\r\ntheodolite with him, how much his interest in the monument would have\r\nbeen increased!\r\n\r\n[5] See especially _Nature_, July 2, 1891 p. 201.\r\n\r\n[6] Gardner, Paisley and London.\r\n\r\n[7] “The Prehistoric Stone Monuments of the British Isles--Cornwall.”\r\n\r\n[8] “The French Stonehenge: An Account of the Principal Megalithic\r\nRemains in the Morbihan Archipelago.” By T.

The temple axis along the line pointing to the\r\ncelestial body involved, then became the chief feature, and tens of\r\nyears were spent in lengthening, constricting and embellishing it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--The axis of the Temple of Karnak, looking\r\nsouth-east, from outside the north-west pylon (from a photograph by the\r\nauthor).]\r\n\r\nFrom one end of an Egyptian temple to the other we find the axis marked\r\nout by narrow apertures in the various pylons, and many walls with doors\r\ncrossing the axis. There are seventeen or eighteen of these apertures in\r\nthe solar temple of Amen-Rā at Karnak, limiting the light which falls\r\ninto the Holy of Holies or Sanctuary. This construction gives one a very\r\ndefinite impression that every part of the temple was built to subserve\r\na special object, viz., to limit the sunlight which fell on its front\r\ninto a narrow beam, and to carry it to the other extremity of the\r\ntemple--into the sanctuary, where the high priest performed his\r\nfunctions. The sanctuary was always blocked. There is no case in which\r\nthe beam of light can pass absolutely through a temple (Figs. 12 and\r\n13).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Plan of the Temple of Ramses II. in the\r\nMemnonia at Thebes (from Lepsius), showing the pylon at the open end,\r\nthe various doors along the axis, the sanctuary at the closed end, and\r\nthe temple at right angles.]\r\n\r\nIn Britain the case was different, there was neither skill nor workers\r\nsufficient to erect such stately piles, and as a consequence one\r\nstructure had to do the work of several and it had to be done in the\r\nmost economical way. Hence the circle with the observer at the centre\r\nand practically a temple axis in every direction among which could be\r\nchosen the chief directions required, each alignment being defined by\r\nstones, more or less distant, or openings in the circle itself.\r\n\r\nNow for some particulars with regard to those parts of Stonehenge which\r\nlend themselves to the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe main architecture of Stonehenge consisted of an external circle of\r\nabout 100 feet in diameter, composed of thirty large upright stones,\r\nnamed sarsens, connected by continuous lintels. The upright stones\r\nformerly stood 14 feet above the surface of the ground. They have nobs\r\nor tenons on the top which fit into mortice holes in the lintels. Within\r\nthis peristyle there was originally an inner structure of ten still\r\nlarger upright stones, arranged in the shape of a horseshoe, formed by\r\nfive isolated trilithons which rose progressively from N.E. to S.W., the\r\nloftiest stones being 25 feet above the ground. About one-half of these\r\nuprights have fallen, and a still greater number of the imposts which\r\nthey originally carried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--One of the remaining Trilithons.]\r\n\r\nThere is also another circle of smaller upright stones, respecting which\r\nthe only point requiring notice now is that none of them would have\r\ninterrupted the line of the axis of the avenue. The circular temple was\r\nalso surrounded by the earthen bank, shown in Fig. 15, of about 300\r\nfeet in diameter, interrupted towards the north-east by receiving into\r\nitself the banks forming the avenue before mentioned, which is about 50\r\nfeet across. Within this avenue, no doubt an old _via sacra_, and\r\nlooking north-east from the centre of the temple, at about 250 feet\r\ndistance and considerably to the right hand of the axis, stands an\r\nisolated stone, which from a mediæval legend has been named the Friar’s\r\nHeel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--General plan; the outer circle, naos and avenue\r\nof Stonehenge.\r\n\r\n_F.H._ = Friar’s Heel.]\r\n\r\nThe axis passes very nearly centrally through an intercolumniation (so\r\nto call it) between two uprights of the external circle and between the\r\nuprights of the westernmost trilithon as it originally stood. Of this\r\ntrilithon the southernmost upright with the lintel stone fell in 1620,\r\nbut the companion survived as the leaning stone which formed a\r\nconspicuous and picturesque object for many years, but happily now\r\nrestored to its original more dignified and safer condition of\r\nvertically. The inclination of this stone, however, took place in the\r\ndirection of the axis of the avenue, and as the distance between it and\r\nits original companion is known both by the analogy of the two perfect\r\ntrilithons and by the measure of the mortice holes on the lintel they\r\nformerly supported, we obtain by bisection the distance, 11 inches, from\r\nits edge, of a point in the continuation of the central axis of the\r\navenue and temple.\r\n\r\nThe banks which form the avenue have suffered much degradation. It\r\nappears from Sir Richard Colt Hoare’s account that at the beginning of\r\nthe last century they were distinguishable for a much greater distance\r\nthan at present, but they are still discernible, especially on the\r\nnorthern side, for more than 1300 feet from the centre of the temple,\r\nand particularly the line of the bottom of the ditch from which the\r\nearth was taken to form the bank, and which runs parallel to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AT STONEHENGE IN 1901[11]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn investigation was undertaken by Mr. Penrose and myself in the spring\r\nof 1901, as a sequel to analogous work in Egypt and Greece, with a view\r\nto determine whether the orientation theory could throw any light upon\r\nthe date of the foundation of Stonehenge, concerning which authorities\r\nvary in their estimates by some thousands of years. Ours was not the\r\nfirst attempt to obtain the date of Stonehenge by means of astronomical\r\nconsiderations. In Mr. Godfrey Higgins’ work[12] he refers to a method\r\nof attack connected with precession. This furnished him with the date\r\n4000 B.C.\r\n\r\nMore recently, Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie,[13] whose plan of the stones\r\nis a valuable contribution to the study of Stonehenge, was led by his\r\nmeasures of the orientation to a date very greatly in the opposite\r\ndirection, but, owing to an error in his application of the change of\r\nobliquity, clearly a mistaken one.\r\n\r\nThe chief astronomical evidence in favour of the solar temple theory\r\nlies in the fact that the “avenue,” as it is called, formed by two\r\nancient earthen banks, extends for a considerable distance from the\r\nstructure, in the general direction of the sunrise at the summer\r\nsolstice, precisely in the same way as in Egypt a long avenue of\r\nsphinxes indicates the principal outlook of a temple.\r\n\r\nThese earthen banks defining the avenue do not exist alone. As will be\r\nseen from the sketch plan (Fig. 15), there is a general common line of\r\ndirection for the avenue and the principal axis of the structure; and\r\nthe general design of the building, together with the position and shape\r\nof the naos, indicates a close connection of the whole temple structure\r\nwith the direction of the avenue. There may have been other pylon and\r\nscreen equivalents as in other ancient temples, which have disappeared,\r\nthe object being to confine the illumination to a small part of the\r\nnaos. There can be little doubt, also, that the temple was originally\r\nroofed in, and that the sun’s first ray, suddenly shining into the\r\ndarkness, formed a fundamental part of the cultus.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the question of the roof, however, the above suggestion,\r\nI now find, is not new, the view having been held by no less an\r\nauthority than Dr. Thurnham, who apparently was led to it by the\r\nrepresentations of the Scandinavian temples as covered and enclosed\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nSince the actual observation of sunrise was doubtless made within the\r\nsanctuary itself, we seem justified in taking the orientation of the\r\naxis to be the same as that of the avenue, and since in the present\r\nstate of the S.W. trilithon the direction of the avenue can probably be\r\ndetermined with greater accuracy than that of the temple axis itself,\r\nthe estimate of date must be based upon the orientation of the avenue.\r\nFurther evidence will be given, however, to show that the direction of\r\nthe axis of the temple, so far as it can now be determined, is\r\nsufficiently accordant with the direction of the avenue.\r\n\r\nThe orientation of this avenue may be examined upon the same principles\r\nthat have been found successful in the case of Greek and Egyptian\r\ntemples--that is, on the assumption that Stonehenge was a solar temple,\r\nand that the greatest function took place at sunrise on the longest day\r\nof the year. This not only had a religious motive; it had also the\r\neconomic value of marking officially and distinctly that time of the\r\nyear and the beginning of an annual period.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, possible that the present structure may have had other\r\ncapabilities, such as being connected with the May year, the equinoxes\r\nor the winter solstice; but it is with its uses at the summer solstice\r\nalone that we now deal.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference in treatment between the observations required for\r\nStonehenge and those which are available for Greek or Egyptian solar\r\ntemples. In the case of the latter, the effect of the precession of the\r\nequinoxes upon the stars, which as warning clock stars were almost\r\ninvariably connected with those temples, offers the best measure of the\r\ndates of foundation; but in Britain, owing to the brightness of the dawn\r\nat the summer solstice, such a star could not have been employed, so\r\nthat we can rely only on the secular change of the obliquity as\r\naffecting the azimuth of the point of sunrise. This requires the\r\nmeasurements to be taken with very great precision, and as the azimuth\r\nof the place of sunrise varies with the latitude, and as a datum point\r\non the horizon in a known position was also required, Colonel Johnston,\r\nR.E., the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey, was asked for and\r\nobligingly supplied the following particulars:\r\n\r\n                                        { Lat.    51° 10′ 42″\r\n  Centre of stone circle, Stonehenge    { Long. W. 1  49  99\r\n\r\n                                        { Lat.    51°  3′ 52″\r\n  Centre of spire, Salisbury Cathedral  { Long.    1  47  45\r\n\r\nThe real point was to determine the direction of the so-called avenue.\r\nMeasurements taken from the line of the bottom of the ditch assisted\r\nmaterially those taken from the crown of the bank itself. With this help\r\nand by using the southern bank and ditch whenever it admitted of\r\nrecognition, a fair estimate of the central line could be arrived at. To\r\nverify this, two pegs were placed at points 140 feet apart along the\r\nline near the commencement of the avenue, and four others at distances\r\naveraging 100 feet apart nearer the further recognisable extremity, and\r\ntheir directions were measured with the theodolite, independently by two\r\nobservers, the reference point being Salisbury Spire, of which the exact\r\nbearing had been communicated by Colonel Johnston.\r\n\r\nThis bearing was also measured locally by observations of the Sun and of\r\nPolaris, the mean of which differed by less than 20″ from the Ordnance\r\nvalue. The resulting observations gave for the axis of the avenue\r\nnearest the commencement an azimuth of 49° 38′ 48″, and for that of the\r\nmore distant part 49° 32′ 54″. The mean of these two lines drawn from\r\nthe central interval of the great trilithon, already referred to, passes\r\nbetween two of the sarsens of the exterior circle, which have an opening\r\nof about 4 feet, within a few inches of their middle point, the\r\ndeviation being northwards. This may be considered to prove the close\r\ncoincidence of the original axis of the temple with the direction of the\r\navenue.\r\n\r\nThis value of the azimuth, the mean of which is 49° 35′ 51″, is\r\nconfirmed by the information, also supplied from the Ordnance Survey,\r\nthat from the centre of the temple, the bearing to the N.E. of the\r\nprincipal bench mark on a hill, about 8 miles distant, the bench mark\r\nbeing very near a well-known ancient fortified British encampment named\r\nSilbury or Sidbury, is 49° 34′ 18″; and that the same line continued\r\nthrough Stonehenge, to the south-west, strikes another ancient\r\nfortification, namely, Grovely Castle, about 6 miles distant, and at\r\npractically the same azimuth, viz., 49° 35′ 51″. For the above reasons\r\n49° 34′ 18″ has been adopted for the azimuth of the avenue.\r\n\r\nThe summer solstice sunrise in 1901 was also watched for by Mr. Howard\r\nPayn on five successive mornings, viz., June 21 to 25, and was\r\nsuccessfully observed on the last occasion. As soon as the Sun’s limb\r\nwas sufficiently above the horizon for its bisection to be well\r\nmeasured, it was found to be 8′ 40″ northwards of the peak of the\r\nFriar’s Heel, which was used as the reference point; the altitude of the\r\nhorizon being 35′ 48″. The azimuth of this peak from the point of\r\nobservation had been previously ascertained to be 50° 39′ 5″, giving for\r\nthat of the Sun when measured, 50° 30′ 25″; by calculation that of the\r\nSun, with the limb 2′ above the horizon, should be 50° 30′ 54″. This\r\nobservation was therefore completely in accordance with the results\r\nwhich had been obtained otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe time which would elapse between geometrical sunrise, that is, with\r\nthe upper limb tangential with the horizon, and that which is here\r\nsupposed, would be about 17 seconds, and the difference of azimuth would\r\nbe 3′ 15″.\r\n\r\nThe remaining point was to find what value should be given to the Sun’s\r\ndeclination when it appeared showing itself 2′ above the horizon, the\r\nazimuth being 49° 34′ 18″.\r\n\r\nThe data obtained for the determination of the required epoch were as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n(1.) The elevation of the local horizon at the sunrise point seen by a\r\nman standing between the uprights of the great trilithon (a distance of\r\nabout 8000 feet) is about 35′ 30″, and 2′ additional for Sun’s upper\r\nlimb makes 37′ 30″.\r\n\r\n(2.) -Refraction + parallax, 27′ 20″.\r\n\r\n(3.) Sun’s semi-diameter, allowance being made for greater eccentricity\r\nthan at present, 15′ 45″.\r\n\r\n(4.) Sun’s azimuth, 49° 34′ 18″, and N. latitude, 51° 10′ 42″.\r\n\r\nFrom the above data the Sun’s declination works out 23° 54′ 30″ N., and\r\nby Stockwell’s tables of the obliquity, which are based upon modern\r\ndeterminations of the elements of the solar system,[14] the date is\r\nfound to be 1680 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt is to be understood that on account of the slight uncertainty as to\r\nthe original line of observation and the very slow rate of change in\r\nthe obliquity of the ecliptic, the date thus derived may possibly be in\r\nerror by 200 years more or less; this gives us a date of construction\r\nlying between say 1900 and 1500 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn this investigation the so-called Friar’s Heel was used only as a\r\nconvenient point for reference and verification in measurement, and no\r\ntheory was formed as to its purpose. It is placed at some distance, as\r\nbefore mentioned, to the south of the axis of the avenue, so that at the\r\ndate arrived at for the erection of the temple the Sun must have\r\ncompletely risen before it was vertically over the summit of the stone.\r\nIt may be remarked, further, that more than 500 years must yet elapse\r\nbefore such a coincidence can take place at the beginning of sunrise.\r\n\r\nIn an Appendix certain details of the observations are given.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter I propose to show that an independent archæological\r\ninquiry carried out, in a most complete and admirable way, just after\r\nMr. Penrose and myself had obtained our conclusion, entirely\r\ncorroborates the date at which we had arrived.\r\n\r\n[11] This chapter and the end of the previous one are mainly based on\r\nthe paper communicated by Mr. Penrose and myself to the Royal Society\r\n(see _Proceedings_, _Royal Society_, vol. 69, p. 137 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n[12] _The Celtic Druids_. 4to.

The operations which secured them\r\nwere designed and carried out in order to re-erect the leaning stone\r\nwhich threatened to fall, a piece of work recommended to Sir Edmund\r\nAntrobus by the Society of Antiquaries of London and other learned\r\nbodies, and conducted at his desire and expense.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--The arrangements for raising the stone, looking\r\nnorth-east.]\r\n\r\nThey were necessarily on a large scale, for the great monolith, “the\r\nleaning stone,” is the largest in England, the Rudston monolith\r\nexcepted. It stood behind the altar stone, over which it leant at an\r\nangle of 65 degrees, resting at one point against a small stone of\r\nsyenite. Half-way up it had a fracture one-third across it; the weight\r\nof stone above this fracture was a dangerous strain on it, so that both\r\npowerful machinery and great care and precautions had to be used.\r\nProfessor Gowland was charged by the Society of Antiquaries with the\r\nconduct of the excavations necessary in the work. The engineering\r\noperations were planned by Mr. Carruthers, and Mr. Detmar Blow was\r\nresponsible for the local superintendence. Mr. Blow thus describes the\r\narrangements (_Journal_ Institute of British Architects, 3rd series,\r\nix., January, 1902):--\r\n\r\n“A strong cradle of 12-inch square baulks of timber was bolted round the\r\nstone, with packing and felt, to prevent any marking of the stone. To\r\nthe cradle were fixed two 1-inch steel eyebolts to receive the blocks\r\nfor two six-folds of 6-inch ropes. These were secured and wound on to\r\ntwo strong winches fifty feet away, with four men at each winch. When\r\nthe ropes were thoroughly tight, the first excavation was made as the\r\nstone was raised on its west side.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--The cradle and supports, looking west.]\r\n\r\nThe method employed by Professor Gowland in the excavation should be a\r\nmodel for all future work of the kind.\r\n\r\nAbove each space to be excavated was placed a frame of wood, bearing on\r\nits long sides the letters A to H, and on its short sides the letters R\r\nM L, each letter being on a line one foot distant from the next. By this\r\nmeans the area to be excavated was divided into squares each having the\r\ndimension of a square foot. A long rod divided into 6-inch spaces,\r\nnumbered from 1 to 16, was also provided for indicating the depth from\r\nthe datum line of anything found. In this way a letter on the long sides\r\nof the frame, together with one on the short sides, and a number on the\r\nvertical rod, indicated the position of any object found in any part of\r\nthe excavation.\r\n\r\nExcavations were necessary because to secure the stone for the future\r\nthe whole of the adjacent soil had to be removed down to the rock level,\r\nso that it could be replaced by concrete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--The frame used to locate the finds.]\r\n\r\nAll results were registered by Professor Gowland in relation to a datum\r\nline 337·4 feet above sea level. The material was removed in buckets,\r\nand carefully sifted through a series of sieves 1-inch, ¹⁄₂-inch,\r\n¹⁄₄-inch, and ¹⁄₈-inch mesh, in order that the smallest object might\r\nnot be overlooked.\r\n\r\nFrom the exhaustive account of his work given by Professor Gowland to\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries (_Archaeologia_, lviii.), I gather three\r\nresults of the highest importance from the point of view I am\r\nconsidering. These were, first, the finding of an enormous number of\r\nimplements; secondly, the disposition and relative quantities of the\r\nchippings of the sarsen and blue stones; and thirdly, the discovery of\r\nthe method by which the stones were originally erected.\r\n\r\nI will take the implements first. This, in a condensed form, is what\r\nProfessor Gowland says about them:--\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred flint implements were found, and the greater number\r\noccurred in the stratum of chalk rubble which either directly overlaid\r\nor was on a level with the bed rock. They may all be arranged generally\r\nin the following classes:--\r\n\r\n_Class I._--Axes roughly chipped and of rude forms, but having\r\nwell-defined, more or less sharp cutting edges.\r\n\r\n_Class II._--Hammerstones, with more or less well-chipped, sharp curved\r\nedges. Most may be correctly termed hammer-axes. They are chipped to an\r\nedge at one end, but at the other are broad and thick, and in many\r\nexamples terminated there by a more or less flat surface. In some the\r\nnatural coating of the flint is left untouched at the thick end.\r\n\r\n_Class III._--Hammerstones, more or less rounded. Some specimens appear\r\nto have once had distinct working edges, but they are now much blunted\r\nand battered by use.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above flint implements were found about thirty\r\nhammerstones, consisting of large pebbles or small boulders of the hard\r\nquartzite variety of sarsen. Some have been roughly broken into\r\nconvenient forms for holding in the hand, whilst a few have been rudely\r\ntrimmed into more regular shapes. They vary in weight from about a pound\r\nup to six and a half pounds. To these we have to add mauls, a more\r\nremarkable kind of hammerstone than those just enumerated. They are\r\nponderous boulders of the quartzite variety of sarsen with their\r\nbroadest sides more or less flat. Their weights range from about 40 lb.\r\nto 64 lb.\r\n\r\nHow came these flints and stones where they were found? Prof. Gowland\r\ngives an answer which everybody will accept. The implements must be\r\nregarded as the discarded tools of the builders of Stonehenge, dumped\r\ndown into the holes as they became unfit for use, and, in fact, used to\r\npack the monoliths as they were erected. We read:--“Dealing with the\r\ncavity occupied by No. 55 before its fall, the mauls were found wedged\r\nin below the front of its base to act together with the large blocks of\r\nsarsen as supports” (p. 54). Nearly all bear evidence of extremely rough\r\nusage, their edges being jagged and broken, just as we should expect to\r\nfind after such rough employment. We evidently have to deal with\r\nbuilders doing their work in the Stone and not in the Bronze age. But\r\nwas the age Palæolithic or Neolithic?\r\n\r\nProf. Gowland writes:--\r\n\r\n“Perhaps the most striking features of the flint implements is their\r\nextreme rudeness, and that there is not a single ground or polished\r\nspecimen among them. This, at first sight and without due consideration,\r\nmight be taken to indicate an extremely remote age. But in this\r\nconnection it must be borne in mind that in the building of such a\r\nstupendous structure as Stonehenge, the tools required must have been\r\nnumbered by thousands. The work, too, was of the roughest character, and\r\nfor such only rude tools were required. The highly finished and polished\r\nimplements which we are accustomed to consider, and rightly so, as\r\ncharacteristic of Neolithic man, would find no place in such work. They\r\nrequired too much labour and time for their manufacture, and, when made,\r\ncould not have been more effective than the hammer-axes and hammerstones\r\nfound in the excavations, which could be so easily fashioned by merely\r\nrudely shaping the natural flints, with which the district abounds, by a\r\nfew well directed blows of a sarsen pebble.”\r\n\r\nOn this ground Prof. Gowland is of opinion that, notwithstanding their\r\nrudeness, they may be legitimately ascribed to the Neolithic age, and,\r\nit may be, near its termination, that is, before the Bronze age, the\r\ncommencement of which has been placed at 1400 B.C. by Sir John Evans for\r\nBritain, though he is inclined to think that estimate too low, and 2000\r\nB.C. by Montelius for Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Some of the Flint Implements.]\r\n\r\nProf. Gowland guardedly writes:--\r\n\r\n“The occurrence of stone tools does not alone prove with absolute\r\ncertainty that Stonehenge belongs to the Neolithic age, although it\r\naffords a strong presumption in favour of that view. But, and this is\r\nimportant, had bronze been in general or even moderately extensive use\r\nwhen the stones were set up, it is in the highest degree probable that\r\nsome implement of that metal would have been lost within the area of the\r\nexcavations, and if so lost, it would certainly have been found together\r\nwith the stone tools. Further, the employment of deer’s horn picks for\r\nthe extensive excavations made in the chalk around the base of the\r\nmonoliths also tends to support the view that bronze implements cannot\r\nhave been in common use. If they had it would seem not unreasonable to\r\nassume that they would have been employed, as they would have been so\r\nmuch more effective for such work than the picks of deer’s horn.\r\n\r\n“Again, the chippings of the stones of Stonehenge in two of the Bronze\r\nage barrows[15] in its neighbourhood show that it is of earlier date\r\nthan they.”\r\n\r\nAnd finally:--\r\n\r\n“In my opinion, the date when copper or bronze was first known in\r\nBritain is a very remote one, as no country in the world presented\r\ngreater facilities for their discovery. The beginning of their\r\napplication to practical uses should, I think, be placed at least as far\r\nback as 1800 B.C., and that date I am inclined to give, until further\r\nevidence is forthcoming, as the approximate date of the erection of\r\nStonehenge.”\r\n\r\nNow the date arrived at by Mr. Penrose and myself on astronomical\r\ngrounds was about 1700 B.C. It is not a little remarkable that\r\nindependent astronomical and archæological inquiries conducted in the\r\nsame year should have come so nearly to the same conclusion. If a\r\ngeneral agreement be arrived at regarding it, we have a firm basis for\r\nthe study of other similar ancient monuments in this country.\r\n\r\nI have previously in this book referred to the fact that the trilithons\r\nof the naos and the stones of the outer circle are all built up of\r\nso-called “sarsen” stones. To describe their geological character, I\r\ncannot do better than quote, from Mr. Cunnington’s “Geology of\r\nStonehenge,”[16] their origin according to Prestwich.\r\n\r\n“Among the _Lower Tertiaries_ (the Eocene of Sir Charles Lyell) are\r\ncertain sands and mottled clays, named by Mr. Prestwich the Woolwich and\r\nReading beds, from their being largely developed at these places, and\r\nfrom these he proves the sarsens to have been derived; although they are\r\nseldom found _in situ_, owing to the destruction of the stratum to which\r\nthey belonged. They are large _masses of sand concreted together_ by a\r\nsiliceous cement, and when the looser portions of the stratum were\r\nwashed away, the blocks of sandy rocks were left scattered over the\r\nsurface of the ground.\r\n\r\n“At Standen, near Hungerford, large masses of sarsen are found,\r\nconsisting almost _entirely_ of flints, formed into conglomerate with\r\nthe sand. Flints are also common in some of the large stones forming the\r\nancient temple of Avebury.\r\n\r\n“The abundance of these remains, especially in some of the valleys of\r\nNorth Wilts, is very remarkable. Few persons who have not seen them can\r\nform an adequate idea of the extraordinary scene presented to the eye\r\nof the spectator, who standing on the brow of one of the hills near\r\nClatford, sees stretching for miles before him, countless numbers of\r\nthese enormous stones, occupying the middle of the valley, and winding\r\nlike a mighty stream towards the south.”\r\n\r\nThese stones, then, may be regarded as closely associated with the local\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nThe exact nature of the stones, called “blue stones,” can best be\r\ngathered from a valuable “Note” by Prof. Judd which accompanies Prof.\r\nGowland’s paper. These blue stones are entirely unconnected with the\r\nlocal geology; they must, therefore, represent boulders of the Glacial\r\ndrift, or they must have been brought by man, from distant localities.\r\nProf. Judd inclines to the first opinion.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between these two kinds of stone are well shown by Prof.\r\nGowland:--\r\n\r\n“The large monoliths of the outer circle, and the trilithons of the\r\nhorse-shoe are all sarsens. [See general plan, Fig. 15.] These sarsens\r\nin their composition are sandstones, consisting of quartz-sand, either\r\nfine or coarse, occasionally mixed with pebbles and angular bits of\r\nflint, all more or less firmly cemented together with silica. They are\r\nthe relics of the concretionary masses which had become consolidated in\r\nthe sandstone beds that once overlaid the chalk of the district, and had\r\nresisted the destructive agencies by which the softer parts of the beds\r\nwere removed in geological times. They range in structure from a\r\ngranular rock resembling loaf sugar in internal appearance to one of\r\ngreat compactness similar to and sometimes passing into quartzite.\r\n\r\n“The monoliths and trilithons all consist of the granular rock. The\r\nexamples of the compact quartzite variety, of which many were found in\r\nthe excavations, were almost without exception either hammerstones that\r\nhad been used in shaping and dressing the monoliths, or fragments which\r\nhad been broken from off them in these operations.\r\n\r\n“The small monoliths, the so-called ‘blue stones,’ which form the inner\r\ncircle and the inner horse-shoe, are, with the undermentioned\r\nexceptions, all of diabase more or less porphyritic. Two are porphyrite\r\n(formerly known as felstone or hornstone). Two are argillaceous\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\n“Mr. William Cunnington, in his valuable paper, ‘Stonehenge Notes,’\r\nrecords the discovery of two stumps of ‘blue stones’ now covered by the\r\nturf. One of these lies in the inner horseshoe between Nos. 61 and 62,\r\nand 9 feet distant from the latter. It is diabase. The other is in the\r\ninner circle between Nos. 32 and 33, 10 feet from the former, and\r\nconsists of a soft calcareous altered tuff, afterwards designated for\r\nthe sake of brevity fissile rock.\r\n\r\n“The altar stone is of micaceous sandstone.”\r\n\r\nI now come to the second point, to which I shall return in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nIn studying the material obtained from the excavations, it was found in\r\nalmost every case that the number of chippings and fragments of blue\r\nstone largely exceeded that of the sarsens; more than this, diabase\r\n(blue stone) and sarsen were found together in the layer overlying the\r\nsolid chalk (p. 15). Chippings of diabase were the most abundant, but\r\nthere were few large pieces of it. Sarsen, on the other hand, occurred\r\nmost abundantly in lumps (p. 20); very few small chips of sarsen were\r\nfound (p. 42). Hence Prof. Gowland is of opinion that the sarsen blocks\r\nwere roughly hewn where they were found (p. 40); the local tooling,\r\nexecuted with the small quartzite hammers and mauls, would produce not\r\nchips but dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Showing the careful tooling of the Sarsens.]\r\n\r\nFinally, I reach the third point of importance from the present\r\nstandpoint; the excavations produced clear evidence touching the mode of\r\nerection. Prof. Gowland’s memoir deals only with the leaning stone, but\r\nI take it for granted that the same method was employed throughout: the\r\nmethod was this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Face of rock against which a stone was made to\r\nrest.]\r\n\r\n(1) The ground in the site a stone was to occupy was removed, the chalk\r\nrock being cut into in such a manner as to leave a ledge, on which the\r\nbase of the stone was to rest, _and a perpendicular face rising from it,\r\nagainst which as a buttress_ one side would bear when set up. From the\r\nbottom of this hole an inclined plane was cut to the surface down which\r\nthe monolith which had already been dressed was slid until its base\r\nrested on the ledge.\r\n\r\n(2) It was then gradually raised into a vertical position by means first\r\nof levers and afterwards of ropes. The levers would be long trunks of\r\ntrees, to one end of which a number of ropes was attached (this method\r\nis still employed in Japan); so that the weights and pulling force of\r\nmany men might be exerted on them. The stronger ropes were probably of\r\nhide or hair, but others of straw, or of withes of hazel or willow, may\r\nhave been in use for minor purposes.\r\n\r\n(3) As the stone was raised, it was packed up with logs of timber and\r\nprobably also with blocks of stone placed beneath it.\r\n\r\n(4) After its upper end had reached a certain elevation, ropes were\r\nattached to it, and it was then hauled by numerous men into a vertical\r\nposition, _so that its back rested against the perpendicular face of the\r\nchalk which had been prepared for it_. During this part of the\r\noperation, struts of timber would probably be placed against its sides\r\nto guard against slip, a precaution taken when the leaning stone was\r\nraised and until the foundation was properly set.\r\n\r\nAs regards the raising of the lintels, and imposts, and the placing of\r\nthem on the tops of the uprights, there would be even less difficulty\r\nthan in the erection of the uprights themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--The leaning stone upright before the struts\r\nwere removed.]\r\n\r\nIt could be easily effected by the simple method practised in Japan for\r\nplacing heavy blocks of stone in position. The stone, when lying on the\r\nground, would be raised a little at one end by means of long wooden\r\nlevers. A packing of logs would then be placed under the end so raised,\r\nthe other extremity of the stone would be similarly raised and packed,\r\nand the raising and packing at alternate ends would be continued until\r\nthe block had gradually reached the height of the uprights. It would\r\nthen be simply pushed forward by levers until it rested upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Stonehenge, 1905.]\r\n\r\nIt is not often that an engineering operation has been made so\r\nsubservient to the interests of science as the one we have dealt with in\r\nthis chapter. It is satisfactory to know not only that much new\r\nknowledge has been acquired by Professor Gowland and his coadjutors, but\r\nthat the famous leaning stone has now been set upright in such fashion\r\nthat it will remain upright for hundreds of years. May the other leaning\r\nstones soon receive the same treatment.\r\n\r\n[15] Sir Richard Colt Hoare, _Ancient History of South Wiltshire_, p.\r\n127. (London, 1812); W. Stukeley, _Stonehenge_, p. 46.

These stones, all composed of\r\nsarsen, which, be it remarked, have been trimmed and tooled, are not\r\nalone in question. We have:--\r\n\r\n(1) An interior circle broken in many places, and other stones near the\r\nnaos, composed of stones, “blue stones,” which, as we have seen, are of\r\nan entirely different origin and composition.\r\n\r\n(2) Two smaller _untrimmed_ sarsen stones lying near the vallum, _not_\r\nat the same distance from it, the line joining them passing nearly, but\r\nnot quite, through the centre of the sarsen circle. The amplitude of the\r\nline joining them is approximately 26° S. of E. and 26° N. of W. Of\r\nthese stones, the stump of the N.W. one is situated 22 feet from the top\r\nof the vallum according to the Ordnance plan. The S.E. stone has fallen,\r\nbut according to careful observations and measurements by Mr. Penrose,\r\nwhen erect its centre was 14 feet from the top of the vallum. The centre\r\nof the line joining the stones is therefore about 4 feet to the S.E. of\r\nthe axis of the present circles, which, it may be stated, passes 3 feet\r\nto the N.W. of the N.W. edge of the Friar’s Heel (see Fig. 24).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Map of the Stones made by the Ordnance\r\nSurvey.[17] A, N.W. stone; B, S.E. stone; C, Friar’s Heel; D, Slaughter\r\nstone.]\r\n\r\nThere are besides these two large _untrimmed_ sarsen stones, one\r\nstanding some distance outside the vallum, one recumbent lying on the\r\nvallum; both nearly, but not quite, in the sunrise line as viewed from\r\nthe centre of the sarsen circle. These are termed the “Friar’s Heel” and\r\n“Slaughter Stone” respectively.\r\n\r\nI will deal with (1) first, and begin by another quotation from Mr.\r\nCunnington, who displayed great acumen in dealing with the smaller\r\nstones not sarsens.\r\n\r\n“The most important consideration connected with the smaller stones, and\r\none which in its archæological bearing has been too much overlooked, is\r\nthe fact of their having been brought from a great distance. I expressed\r\nan opinion on this subject in a lecture delivered at Devizes more than\r\neighteen years ago, and I have been increasingly impressed with it\r\nsince. I believe that these stones would not have been brought from such\r\na distance to a spot where an abundance of building stones equally\r\nsuitable in every respect already existed, unless some special or\r\nreligious value had been attached to them. This goes far to prove that\r\nStonehenge was _originally a temple_, and neither a monument raised to\r\nthe memory of the dead, nor an astronomical calendar or almanac.\r\n\r\n“It has been suggested that they were Danams, or the offerings of\r\nsuccessive votaries. Would there in such case have been such uniformity\r\nof design, or would they have been all alike of foreign materials? I\r\nwould make one remark about the small impost of a trilithon of syenite,\r\nnow lying prostrate within the circle. One writer has followed another\r\nin taking it for granted that there must have been a second,\r\ncorresponding with it, on the opposite side. Of this there is neither\r\nproof nor record, not a trace of one having been seen by any person who\r\nhas written on the subject. This small impost, not being of sarsen, but\r\nsyenite, must have belonged to the original old circle; _it may even\r\nhave suggested to the builders of the present Stonehenge the idea of the\r\nlarge imposts, and trilithons with their tenons and mortices_.”\r\n\r\nIn Prof. Gowland’s examination of the contents of the holes necessarily\r\ndug in his operations, it was found over and over again, indeed almost\r\nuniversally, that the quantity of blue stone chippings was much greater\r\nthan that from the sarsen stones. While the sarsen stones had only been\r\nworked or tooled on their surface, the blue stones had been hewed and\r\ntrimmed in extraordinary fashion; indeed it is stated by Prof. Judd that\r\nthey had been reduced to half their original dimensions in this process,\r\nthe chippings almost equalling the volume of the stones themselves.\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that when the sarsen stones were set up, the sarsen and\r\nblue stones were treated very differently. This being so, the following\r\nquotation from Prof. Judd’s “Note” is interesting (_Archaeologia_,\r\nlviii., p. 81):--\r\n\r\n“I may repeat my conviction that if the prevalent beliefs and traditions\r\nconcerning Stonehenge were true, and the “bluestone” circles were\r\ntransported from some distant locality, either as trophies of war or as\r\nthe sacred treasures of a wandering tribe, it is quite inconceivable\r\nthat they should have been hewed and chipped, as we now know them to\r\nhave been, and reduced in some cases to half their dimensions, _after\r\nhaving been carried with enormous difficulty over land and water, and\r\nover hills and valleys_. On the other hand, in the glacial drift, which\r\nonce probably thinly covered the district, the glacial deposits dying\r\nout very gradually as we proceed southwards, we have a source from which\r\nsuch stones might probably have been derived. It is quite a well-known\r\npeculiarity of the glacial drift to exhibit considerable assemblages of\r\nstones of a particular character at certain spots, each of these\r\nassemblages having probably been derived from the same source.\r\n\r\n“I would therefore suggest as probable that when the early inhabitants\r\nof this island commenced the erection of Stonehenge, Salisbury Plain was\r\nsprinkled over thickly with the great white masses of the sarsen-stones\r\n(‘grey wethers’), and much more sparingly with darker coloured boulders\r\n(the so-called ‘blue-stones’), the last relics of the glacial drift,\r\nwhich have been nearly denuded away. From these two kinds of materials\r\nthe stones suitable for the contemplated temple were selected. It is\r\neven possible that the abundance and association of these two kinds of\r\nmaterials so strikingly contrasted in colour and appearance, at a\r\nparticular spot, may not only have decided the site, but to some extent\r\nhave suggested the architectural features of the noble structure of\r\nStonehenge.”\r\n\r\nIf we grant everything that Prof. Judd states, the question remains--why\r\ndid the same men in the same place at the same time treat the sarsen and\r\nblue stones so differently?\r\n\r\nI shall show subsequently that there is a definite answer to the\r\nquestion on one assumption.\r\n\r\nI next come to (2). The important point about these stones is that with\r\nthe amplitude 26°, at Stonehenge, a line from the centre of the circle\r\nover the N.W. stone would mark the sunset place in the first week in\r\nMay, and a line over the S.E. stone would similarly deal with the\r\nNovember sunrise. We are thus brought in presence of the May-November\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAnother point about these stones is that they are not at the same\r\ndistance from the centre of the sarsen stone circle, which itself is\r\nconcentric with the temenos mound; this is why they lie at different\r\ndistances from the mound. Further, a line drawn from the point of the\r\nFriar’s Heel over the now recumbent Slaughter Stone with the amplitude\r\ndetermined by Mr. Penrose and myself for the summer solstice sunrise in\r\n1680 B.C. cuts the line joining the stones at the middle point,\r\nsuggesting that the four untrimmed sarsen stones provided alignments\r\nboth for the May and June years at about that date.\r\n\r\nNor is this all; the so-called tumuli within the vallum (Fig. 10) may\r\nhave been observation mounds, for the lines passing from the northern\r\ntumulus over the N.W. stone and from the southern tumulus over the S.E.\r\none are parallel to the avenue, and therefore represent the solstitial\r\norientation.\r\n\r\nSo much, then, for the stones. We see that, dealing only with the\r\nuntrimmed sarsens that remain, the places of the May sunset and June and\r\nNovember sunrises were marked from the same central point.\r\n\r\nStatements have been made that there was the stump of another stone\r\nnear the vallum to the S.W., in the line of the Friar’s Heel and\r\nSlaughter Stone, produced backwards, at the same distance from the old\r\ncentre as the N.W. and S.E. stones. This stone was _not_ found in an\r\nexploration by Sir Edmund Antrobus, Mr. Penrose and Mr. Howard Payn by\r\nmeans of a sword and an auger. But the question will not be settled\r\nuntil surface digging is permitted, as a “road” about which there is a\r\npresent contention passes near the spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--The rod on the recumbent stone is placed in and\r\nalong the common axis of the present circle and avenue. It is seen that\r\nthe Friar’s Heel, the top of which is shown in the distance, would hide\r\nthe sunrise place if the axis were a little further to the S.E.]\r\n\r\nBut even this is not the only evidence we have for the May worship in\r\nearly times. There is an old tradition of the slaughter of Britons by\r\nthe Saxons at Stonehenge, known as “The Treachery of the Long Knives”;\r\naccording to some accounts, 460 British chieftains were killed while\r\nattending a banquet and conference. Now at what time of the year did\r\nthis take place? Was it at the summer solstice on June 21? I have\r\ngathered from Guest’s “Mabinogion,” vol. ii. p. 433, and Davies’s\r\n“Mythology of the British Druids,” p. 333, that _the banquet took place\r\non May eve_ “_Meinvethydd_.” Is it likely that this date would have been\r\nchosen in a solar temple dedicated exclusively to the solstice?\r\n\r\nNow the theory to which my work and thought have led me is that the\r\nmegalithic structures at Stonehenge--the worked sarsens with their\r\nmortices and lintels, and above all the trilithons of the magnificent\r\nnaos--represent a re-dedication and a reconstruction, on a more imposing\r\nplan and scale, of a much older temple, which was originally used for\r\nworship in connection with the May year.\r\n\r\n[17] Plans and photographs of Stonehenge, &c., by Colonel Sir Henry\r\nJames, R.E., F.R.S., Director-General of the Ordnance Survey, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MAY AND JUNE WORSHIPS IN BRITTANY\r\n\r\n\r\nI purpose next to inquire whether in the wonderful series of Megalithic\r\nremains in Brittany, remains more extensive than any in Britain, any\r\nlight is thrown on the suggestion I have made that the May Worship\r\npreceded the Solstitial Worship at Stonehenge.\r\n\r\nIt has long been known that the stones which compose the prehistoric\r\nremains in Brittany are generally similar in size and shape to those at\r\nStonehenge, but, as I have already stated, in one respect there is a\r\nvast difference. Instead of a few, arranged in circles as at Stonehenge,\r\nwe have an enormous multitude of the so-called menhirs arranged in many\r\nparallel lines for great distances. Some of these are unhewn like the\r\nFriar’s Heel, some have as certainly been trimmed.\r\n\r\nThe literature which has been devoted to them is very considerable, but\r\nthe authors of it, for the most part, have taken little or no pains to\r\nmaster the few elementary astronomical principles which are necessary to\r\nregard the monuments from the point of view of orientation.\r\n\r\nIt is consoling to know that this cannot be said of the last published\r\ncontribution to our knowledge of this region, which we owe to Monsieur\r\nF. Gaillard, a member of the Paris Anthropological Society and of the\r\nPolymathic Society of Morbihan at Plouharnel.[18]\r\n\r\nM. Gaillard is a firm believer in the orientation theory, and accepts\r\nthe view that a very considerable number of the alignments are\r\nsolstitial. But although he gives the correct azimuths for the\r\nsolstitial points and also figures showing the values of the obliquity\r\nof the ecliptic as far as 2200 B.C., his observations are not\r\nsufficiently precise to enable a final conclusion to be drawn, and his\r\nmethod of fixing the alignments and the selection of the index menhir\r\nare difficult to gather from his memoir and the small plans which\r\naccompany it, which, alas! deal with compass bearings only.\r\n\r\nAll the same, those interested in such researches owe a debt of\r\ngratitude to M. Gaillard for his laborious efforts to increase our\r\nknowledge, and will sympathise with him at the manner in which his\r\nconclusions were treated by the Paris anthropologists. One of them,\r\napparently thinking that the place of sun rising is affected by the\r\nprecession of the equinoxes, used this convincing argument:--“Si, à\r\nl’origine les alignements étaient orientés, comme le pense M. Gaillard,\r\nils ne le pourraient plus être aujourd’hui; au contraire, s’ils le sont\r\nactuellement, on peut affirmer qu’ils ne l’étaient pas alors!”\r\n\r\nM. Gaillard is not only convinced of the solstitial orientation of the\r\navenues, but finds the same result in the case of the dolmens.\r\n\r\nI cannot find any reference in the text to any orientations dealing with\r\nthe farmers’ years, that is with amplitudes of about 25° N. and S. of\r\nthe E. and W. points; but in the diagrams on pp. 78 and 127 I find both\r\navenue and dolmen alignments, which within the limits of accuracy\r\napparently employed may perhaps with justice be referred to them; but\r\nobservations of greater accuracy must be made, and details of the\r\nheights of the horizon at the various points given, before anything\r\ncertain can be said about them.\r\n\r\nI append a reproduction of one of M. Gaillard’s plans, which will give\r\nan idea of his use of the index menhir. It shows the alignments at Le\r\nMénec, lat. 47¹⁄₂° (Fig. 26). The line A--Soleil runs across the stone\r\nalignments and is fixed from A by the menhir B, but there does not seem\r\nany good reason for selecting B except that it appears to fall in the\r\nline of the solstitial azimuth according to M. Gaillard. But if we take\r\nthis azimuth as N. 54° E., then we find the alignments to have an\r\nazimuth roughly of N. 66° E., which gives us the amplitude of 24° N.\r\nmarking the place of sunrise at the beginning of the May and November\r\nyears, and the alignments may have dealt principally with those times of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nI esteem it a most fortunate thing that while I have been casting about\r\nas to the best way of getting more accurate data, Lieutenant Devoir, of\r\nthe French Navy and therefore fully equipped with all the astronomical\r\nknowledge necessary; who resides at Brest and has been studying the\r\nprehistoric monuments in his neighbourhood for many years, has been good\r\nenough to give me the results of his work in that region, in which the\r\nproblems seem to be simpler than further south; for while in the\r\nvicinity of Carnac the menhirs were erected in groups numbering five or\r\nsix thousand, near Brest, lat. 48¹⁄₂°, they are much more restricted in\r\nnumber. I am much indebted to him for permission to use and publish his\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Alignments at Le Ménec.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Devoir, by his many well-planned and approximately accurate\r\nobservations, has put the solstitial orientation beyond question, and,\r\nfurther, has made important observations which prove that the May and\r\nAugust sunrises were also provided for in the systems of alignments. I\r\ngive the following extracts from his letter:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Menhir (A) on Melon Island.]\r\n\r\n“It is about twelve years ago that I remarked in the west part of the\r\nDepartment of Morbihan (near Lorient) the parallelism of the lines\r\nmarked out by monuments of all sorts, and frequently oriented to the\r\nN.E., or rather between N. 50° E. and N. 55° E. I had ascertained,\r\nmoreover, the existence of lines perpendicular to the first named, the\r\nright angle being very well measured.\r\n\r\n“The plans, which refer to the cantons of Ploudalmézeau and of St. Renan\r\n(district of Brest) and of Crozon (district of Chateaulin), have been\r\nmade on a plane-table; the orientations are exact to one or two degrees.\r\n\r\n“In the cantons of Ploudalmézeau and of St. Renan, the monuments are\r\ngenerally simple; seven menhirs are visible of enormous dimensions,\r\nremarkable by the polish of their surface and the regularity of their\r\nsection. The roughnesses hardly ever reach a centimetre; the sections\r\nare more often ovals, sometimes rectangles with the angles rounded or\r\nterminated by semicircles. In the canton of Crozon the monuments are, on\r\nthe contrary, complex; we find a cromlech with an avenue leading to it\r\nof a length of 800 metres, another of 300 metres. Unfortunately, the\r\nrocks employed (sandstone and schist from Plungastel and Crozon) have\r\nresisted less well than the granulite from the north part of the\r\nDepartment. The monuments are for the most part in a very bad condition;\r\nthe whole must, nevertheless, formerly have been comparable with that of\r\nCarnac-Leomariaquer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Melon Island, showing Menhir (A) and Cromlech\r\n(B and C).]\r\n\r\n“For the two regions, granitic and schistose, the results of the\r\nobservations are identical.\r\n\r\n“The monuments lie along lines oriented S. 54° W. → N. 54° E. (54° =\r\nazimuth at the solstices for L = 48° 30′ and _i_ = 23° 30′) and N. 54°\r\nW. → S. 54° E. Some of them determine lines perpendicular to the\r\nmeridian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Menhirs of St. Dourzal, D, E, F.]\r\n\r\n“One menhir (A), 6m. 90 in height and 9m. 20 in circumference, erected\r\nin the small island of Melon (canton of Ploudalmézeau, latitude 48° 29′\r\n05″) a few metres from a tumulus surrounded by the ruins of a cromlech\r\n(B and C), has the section such that the faces, parallel and remarkably\r\nplane, are oriented N. 54° E. (Figs. 27 and 28).\r\n\r\n“At 1300 metres in the same azimuth there is a line of three large\r\nmenhirs (D, E, F), of which one (E) is overthrown. The direction of the\r\nline passes exactly by the menhir A. Prolonged towards the N.E. it\r\nmeets at 3k. 700m. an overturned block of 2m. 50 in height, which is\r\nwithout doubt a menhir; towards the S.W. it passes a little to the south\r\nsome lines of the island of Molène.... (Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Alignment at Lagatjar, G G′.]\r\n\r\n“There exists in the neighbourhood other groups, forming also lines of\r\nthe same orientation and that of the winter solstice. It is advisable to\r\nremark that orientations well determined for the solstices are much less\r\nso for the equinoxes, which is natural, the rising amplitude varying\r\nvery rapidly at this time of year.\r\n\r\n“The same general dispositions are to be found in the complex monuments\r\nof the peninsula of Crozon. I take for example the alignments of\r\nLagatjar. Two parallel lines of menhirs, G G′ H H′, are oriented to S.\r\n54° E. and cut perpendicularly by a third line, I I′. There existed less\r\nthan fifty years ago a menhir at K, 6 metres high, which is to-day\r\nbroken and overturned. This megalith, known in the country by the name\r\nof ‘pierre du Conseil’ (a bronze axe was found underneath it) gives with\r\na dolmen situated near Camaret the direction of the sunrise on June 21\r\n(Fig. 31).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Alignments at Lagatjar, showing the pierre du\r\nConseil and the direction of the dolmen. From the pierre du Conseil the\r\ndolmen marks the sunrise place at the summer solstice, and the avenue G\r\nG′ H H′ the sunset place on the same day.]\r\n\r\n“I have just spoken of the lines perpendicular to the solstitial one;\r\nthere exists more especially in the complex monuments another\r\nparticularity which merits attention. Between two monuments, M and N, on\r\na solstitial line, sometimes other menhirs are noticed, the line joining\r\nthem being inclined 12° to the solstitial line, always towards the east”\r\n(Fig. 32).\r\n\r\nI must call particular attention to this important observation of\r\nLieutenant Devoir, for it gives us the amplitude 24° N., the direction\r\nof sunrise at the beginning of the May and August years. It shows,\r\nmoreover, that, as at Le Ménec according to M. Gaillard, the solstitial\r\nand May-August directions were both provided for at the monuments in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Brest so carefully studied by Lieutenant Devoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Menhirs, M N on N.E.-S.W. solstitial alignment.\r\nMenhirs 1, 2, on May-August years alignment, sunrise May-August, sunset\r\nNovember-February.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Devoir points out the wonderful regularity of form and the\r\nfine polish of many of the menhirs. It will have been gathered from his\r\naccount that those most carefully trimmed and tooled belong to the\r\nsolstitial alignments. The one at Kerloas (11 metres high) heads the\r\nlist in point of size; others in the island of Melon (7 metres), at\r\nKergadion (8 metres and 10 metres), Kerenneur, Kervaon and Kermabion\r\nfollow suit. He considers them to have been erected at the time of the\r\nhighest civilisation of the Megalithic peoples. He also states that\r\nthese regularly formed menhirs do not exist at Carnac, or in the region\r\nof Pont l’Abbé, so rich in other remains which certainly refer chiefly\r\nto the May-November year. It seems, then, that in these localities the\r\nMay-August worship first chiefly predominated, and that the index\r\nmenhirs of M. Gaillard which indicate the solstice and which do not form\r\npart of the alignments were erected subsequently.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, the appeal to Brittany is entirely in favour of the\r\nMay-November year worship having preceded the solstitial one.\r\n\r\nI have already stated the evidence at Stonehenge that the sunrise at the\r\nbeginning of the May and August years was observed in an earlier temple\r\nwhich existed before the present structure existed. Were this so we have\r\nanother point common to the British and Breton monuments. I therefore\r\nthink that I may justly claim the Brittany evidence as entirely in\r\nfavour of the suggestion put forward in Chap. IX with regard to\r\nStonehenge.\r\n\r\n[18] “L’Astronomie Préhistorique.” Published in “Les Sciences\r\nPopulaires, revue mensuelle internationale,” and issued separately by\r\nthe administration des “Sciences populaires,” 15 Rue Lebrun, Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL HINTS FOR ARCHÆOLOGISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing chapters will have shown that in dealing with the ancient\r\nmonuments from an astronomical point of view, we have to consider\r\nchiefly the direction of the sight-lines, whether they are marked as in\r\nBrittany by long rows of stones--alignments; as at Stonehenge by an\r\navenue; as in some of our British circles, by two or more circles the\r\ndirection being indicated from the central stone of one to the central\r\nstone of the other, or finally by a single standing stone or barrow.\r\n\r\nIt is important then that before we proceed further in our inquiries we\r\nshould consider how a meaning is got out of these directions, and I\r\npropose to devote this chapter to this question, so that the full use of\r\nthe “azimuths” already referred to and others which are to follow may be\r\nfully understood.\r\n\r\nThere is another matter, at which I hinted on pp. 36 and 42. We have to\r\ninquire whether there are any stones or barrows marking the direction of\r\nthe rising or setting of _stars_, as well as those which deal with the\r\nrising and setting of the _sun_ at different times of the year, which we\r\nhave already found at Stonehenge and in Brittany. To face this question\r\nwe have to consider the stellar as well as solar conditions of\r\nobservations, and as the former are the simpler I will begin with them,\r\nespecially as now there is no question whatever that the rising and\r\nsetting of stars were provided for.\r\n\r\nIn continuation of my work in Egypt in 1891, and Mr. Penrose’s in Greece\r\nin 1892, I have recently endeavoured to see whether there are any traces\r\nin Britain of star observations, including those connected with the\r\nworship of the sun at certain times of the year. We both discovered that\r\nstars, far out of the sun’s course, especially in Egypt, were observed\r\nin the dawn as heralds of sunrise--“warning-stars”--so that the priests\r\nmight have time to prepare the sunrise sacrifice. To do this properly\r\nthe star should rise while the sun is still about 10° below the horizon.\r\nThere is also reason to believe that stars rising not far from the north\r\npoint were also used as clock-stars to enable the time to be estimated\r\nduring the night in the same way as the time during the day could be\r\nestimated by the position of the sun.\r\n\r\nI stated (_Dawn of Astronomy_, p. 319) that Spica was the star the\r\nheliacal rising of which heralded the sun on May-day 3200 B.C. in the\r\ntemple of Menu at Thebes. Sirius was associated with the summer solstice\r\nat about the same time.\r\n\r\nMr. Penrose found this May-day worship continued at Athens on\r\nfoundations built in 1495 B.C. and 2020 B.C., on which the Hecatompedon\r\nand older Erechtheum respectively were subsequently built, the warning\r\nstar being now no longer Spica, but the cluster of the Pleiades rising,\r\nor Antares setting, in the dawn.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that Stonehenge is associated with the solstitial\r\nyear, and I have suggested that it was originally connected with the\r\nMay year; but the probable date of its re-dedication, 1680 B.C., was\r\ndetermined by Mr. Penrose and myself by the change of obliquity.\r\n\r\nNow if Stonehenge or any other British stone circle could be proved to\r\nhave used observations of warning stars, the determination of the date\r\nwhen such observations were made would be enormously facilitated. Mr.\r\nPenrose and myself were content to think that our date might be within\r\n200 years of the truth, whereas if we could use the rapid movement of\r\nstars in declination brought about by the precession of the equinoxes,\r\ninstead of the slow change of the sun’s declination brought about by the\r\nchange of the value of the obliquity, a possible error of 200 years\r\nwould be reduced to one of 10 years.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this enormous advantage, no one so far as I know has yet\r\nmade any inquiry to connect star observations with any of the British\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\nI have recently obtained clear evidence that some circles in different\r\nparts of Britain were used for night work and also in relation to the\r\nMay year, which we know was general over the whole of Europe in early\r\ntimes, and which still determines the quarter-days in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIf the Egyptian and Greek practice were continued here, we should expect\r\nthen to find some indications of the star observations utilised at the\r\ntemple of Min and at the Hecatompedon for the beginning, or the other\r\nchief months, of the May year.\r\n\r\nI have found them, and I will now show the method employed.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, if we assume that the astronomer-priests here did\r\nattempt such observations, what is the most likely way in which they\r\nwould have gone to work?\r\n\r\nThe easiest way for the astronomer-priests to conduct such observations\r\nin a stone circle would be to erect a stone or barrow indicating the\r\ndirection of the place on the horizon at which the star would rise as\r\nseen from the centre of the circle. If the dawn the star was to herald\r\noccurred in the summer, the stone or barrow itself might be visible if\r\nnot too far away, but there was a reason why they should not be too\r\nclose; in a solemn ceremonial the less seen of the machinery the better.\r\n\r\nDoubtless such stones and barrows would be rendered obvious in the dark\r\nby a light placed on or near them. Cups which could hold oil or grease\r\nare known in connection with such stones, and a light thus fed would\r\nsuffice in the open if there were no wind; but in windy weather a\r\ncromlech or some similar shelter must have been provided for it.\r\n\r\nNow if these standing stones or barrows were ever erected and still\r\nremain, accurate plans--not the slovenly plans with which Ferguson and\r\ntoo many others have provided us, giving us either no indication of the\r\nnorth or any other point, or else a rough compass bearing without taking\r\nthe trouble to state the variation at the time and place--will help us.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out that much time has been lost in the\r\ninvestigation of our stone circles, for the reason that in many cases\r\nthe exact relations of the monuments to the chief points of the horizon,\r\nand therefore to the place of sunrise at different times of the year,\r\nhave not been considered; and when they were, the observations were\r\nmade only with reference to the magnetic north, which is different at\r\ndifferent places, and besides is always varying; few indeed have tried\r\nto get at the real astronomical conditions of the problem. The first, I\r\nthink, was Mr. Jonathan Otley, who in 1849 showed the “orientation” of\r\nthe Keswick circle “according to the solar meridian,” giving true solar\r\nbearings throughout the year.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the most accurate plans conceivable, in the absence of a\r\nlong and minute local inquiry, are the 25-inch maps of the Ordnance\r\nSurvey, on which, I have it on the authority of Colonel Johnston the\r\ndistinguished Director, each stone may be taken to be shown with a limit\r\nof error of 6 feet. With a large circular protractor azimuths can be\r\nread to one minute of arc, and in critical cases the true azimuth of the\r\nside lines, which are not necessarily meridians as latitudes are not\r\nmarked, can be found on inquiry at the Ordnance Office, Southampton.\r\n\r\nHaving then true azimuths, the next question concerns the declinations\r\nof the stars which may have been observed.\r\n\r\nThe work of Stockwell in America, Danckworth in Germany,[19] and Dr. W.\r\nJ. S. Lockyer in England, has provided us with tables of the changing\r\ndeclinations of stars throughout past time, or enough of it for our\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAn accurate determination on the 25-inch map of either the _azimuth_\r\n(angular distance from the N. or S. points) or _amplitude_ (angular\r\ndistance from the E. or W. points) of the stone or barrow as seen from\r\nthe centre of the stone circle will enable us to determine the\r\ndeclination of the star at the time when it was observed.\r\n\r\nI give a diagram which enables this determination to be made with the\r\ngreatest ease for any monuments between Land’s End and John o’ Groats,\r\nwhether the direction is recorded by amplitude or azimuth; the\r\ndeclination is read at the side from the value of either indicated, say,\r\nby a dot, at the proper latitude.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, only gives us a first approximation. The angular height\r\nof the point on the horizon to which the alignment or sight-line is\r\ndirected by the stone or barrow from the centre of the circle must be\r\nmost accurately determined, otherwise the declinations may be one or two\r\ndegrees out.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of measurements it is convenient to assume, in the first\r\ninstance, that the horizon is half a degree high, as with this elevation\r\nrefraction is compensated, as the following table will show:\r\n\r\n  Elevation of actual   Bessel’s\r\n       horizon.       refraction.

Danckworth, _Vierteljahrschrift der Astronomischen\r\nGesellschaft_, 16. Jahrgang 1881, p. 9. Dr. Stockwell’s results have\r\nbeen communicated to me by letter. Some, but not all, of Dr. Lockyer’s\r\ncalculations appeared in _The Dawn of Astronomy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL HINTS FOR ARCHÆOLOGISTS--_Continued._\r\n\r\n\r\nI next come to the sun observations.\r\n\r\nFirst we must consider the astronomical differences between the rising\r\nof a star and of the sun, by which we generally mean that small part of\r\nthe sun’s limb first visible.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently imagined that for determining the exact place of\r\nsunrise or sunset in connection with these ancient monuments we have to\r\ndeal with the sun’s centre, as we should do with the sun half risen. As\r\na matter of fact, we must consider that part of the sun’s limb which\r\nfirst makes its appearance above the horizon; the first glimpse of the\r\nupper limb of the sun is in question, say, when the visible limb is 2′\r\nhigh; and we must carefully take the height of the hills over which it\r\nrises into account.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram will at once show the difference between the\r\nrising conditions we have now to consider. It deals with the summer\r\nsolstice, as being the most precise case, in Lat. 59° N.\r\n\r\nAt this time the position of the sun, _that is of the sun’s centre_, as\r\ngiven in the “Nautical Almanac,” is represented by the double circle on\r\nthe sea horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--The Conditions of “Sunrise” at the Summer\r\nSolstice in Lat. 59° N.\r\n\r\n~Vertical axis from bottom: Altitudes SEA HORIZON, HILL ¹⁄₂° HIGH, HILL\r\n1° HIGH, HILL 1¹⁄₂° HIGH.~\r\n\r\n~Horizontal axis from left: Azimuths N 37°-42° E.~]\r\n\r\nThe azimuth of this position is N. 39° 16′ E. This is the equivalent of\r\nthe declination of a star, but it will be seen that the real azimuths we\r\nwant are very different. The dotted circles represent the actual\r\nposition of the sun with regard to the horizon, the continuous circles\r\nthe apparent positions caused by the lifting-up effect of refraction. We\r\nhave the positions in azimuth of the apparent sun as it appears on a sea\r\nhorizon, and when the horizon is formed by hills up to 1¹⁄₂° in vertical\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nTo make this quite clear I give a table which has been computed by Mr.\r\nRolston, of the Solar Physics Observatory, showing azimuths with hills\r\nup to 1¹⁄₂° high for lat. 59° N., and 51° N. nearly the latitude of\r\nStonehenge, of the sun’s upper limb for the summer solstice:--\r\n\r\n                                               Lat. 59°       Lat. 51°\r\n\r\n                                 SUMMER     Rising N-E or  Rising N-E or\r\n                                SOLSTICE.

The\r\ndifference arises, of course, from the fact that the limb is some 16′\r\nfrom the sun’s centre, so that considering the sun’s centre as a star\r\nwith fixed declination, at rising the limb appears before the centre,\r\nand at setting it lags behind it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--The Azimuths of the Sunrise (upper limb) at the\r\nSummer Solstice.\r\n\r\nThe values given in the table have been plotted, and the effect of the\r\nheight of hills on the azimuth is shown. The range of latitude given\r\nenables the diagram to be used in connection with the solstitial\r\nalignments at Carnak, Le Ménac, and other monuments in Brittany.\r\n\r\n~Vertical axis from bottom: LAT. 47-59.~\r\n\r\n~Horizontal axis from left: AZIMUTHS 37-56.~\r\n\r\n~Curves from left: SEA HORIZON, HILLS ¹⁄₂°, 1°, 1¹⁄₂°~]\r\n\r\nIt will also be seen that at sunrise hills increase the azimuth from N.,\r\nand refraction reduces it; while at setting, hills reduce the azimuth\r\nfrom S. and refraction increases it.\r\n\r\nThis diagram and table should fully explain the variation of azimuth at\r\nsunrise caused by the fact that from our present point of view we do not\r\ndeal with the sun as a star.\r\n\r\nTo make the foregoing applicable for monuments in all latitudes between\r\nBrittany and the Orkneys, I give still another diagram, Fig. 37, also\r\nprepared for me by Mr. Rolston which will enable any archæologist to\r\ndetermine approximately, _for the present time_, the azimuth of sunrise\r\nat the summer solstice, without waiting for the 21st of June in any year\r\nactually to observe it.\r\n\r\nAs before stated, I have dealt with the solstice in this chapter because\r\nit affords us the most precise case. I hope to be able to deal with the\r\nMay year sun in the same way later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSTENNESS (Lat. 59° N.).\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote a good deal in _Nature_[20] on sun and star temples in 1891, and\r\nMr. Lewis the next year expressed the opinion that the British stone\r\nmonuments, or some of them, were sun and star temples.\r\n\r\nMr. Magnus Spence, of Deerness, in Orkney, published a pamphlet,\r\n“Standing Stones and Maeshowe of Stenness,”[21] in 1894; it is a reprint\r\nof an article in the _Scottish Review_, October, 1893, showing that the\r\nstones were set up for solar worship. Mr. Cursiter, F.S.A., of Kirkwall,\r\nin a letter to me dated March 15, 1894, a letter suggested by my “Dawn\r\nof Astronomy,” which appeared in that year, and in which the articles\r\nwhich had been published in _Nature_ in 1891 had been expanded, directed\r\nmy attention to the pamphlet.\r\n\r\nI began the consideration of the Stenness circles and alignments in\r\n1901, but other pressing calls on my time then caused me to break off\r\nthe inquiry. Quite recently it occurred to me that a complete study of\r\nthe Stenness circles might throw light on the question of an earlier\r\nStonehenge, so I have gone over the old papers, plotting the results on\r\nthe Ordnance map.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Maeshowe, in the foreground, and the Stones of\r\nStenness. From “Notice of Runic Inscriptions,” by James Farrer, M.P.\r\n(1862).]\r\n\r\nNow that the inquiry is as complete as I can make it without spending\r\nsome time in Orkney with a theodolite, I will begin my reference to\r\nother circles besides Stonehenge by stating the conclusions at which I\r\nhave arrived with regard to the stones of Stenness.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I may state that although many of the alignments to\r\nwhich Mr. Spence refers in his pamphlet on Maeshowe prove to be very\r\ndifferent from those he supposed and drew on the map which accompanies\r\nhis paper, the main point of his contention is amply confirmed.\r\n\r\nI give a copy of the Ordnance map showing the true orientation of these\r\nand of other sight-lines I have made out.\r\n\r\nThe alignments on which Mr. Spence chiefly depended were two, one\r\nrunning from the stone circle past the entrance of Maeshowe to the place\r\nof sunrise at Hallowe’en (November 1), another from the same circle by\r\nthe Barnhouse standing stone to the mid-winter sunrise at the solstice.\r\n\r\nAlthough the map gives these sight-lines, I shall show that they had not\r\nthe use Mr. Spence attributes to them; but still observations of the sun\r\nwere provided for on the days in question, and the circles and\r\noutstanding stones were undoubtedly set up to guide astronomical\r\nobservations relating to the different times of the year. Of course, as\r\nI have shown elsewhere, such astronomical observations were always\r\nassociated with religious celebrations of one kind or another, as the\r\nastronomer and the priest were one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Copy of Ordnance Map showing chief sight-lines\r\nfrom the stones of Stenness.]\r\n\r\nI shall not refer to all the sight-lines indicated, but deal only with\r\nthose which I have without local knowledge been able to test and justify\r\nby means of the 25-inch Ordnance map.\r\n\r\nNot only does calculation prove the worship of the May and June years,\r\nbut I think the facts now before us really go to show that in Orkney the\r\nMay year was the first established, and that the solstitial (June) year\r\ncame afterwards, and this was one of the chief questions I had in view.\r\n\r\nI will begin with the May year. I have already shown, p. 22, that the\r\nhalf-way time between an equinox and a solstice is when the sun’s centre\r\nhas a declination approximately 16° 20′ N. or S. In Orkney, with the\r\nlatitude of 59°, assuming a sea horizon, the approximate amplitude of\r\nsunrise or sunset is 33° 6′, the corresponding azimuth being 56° 54′.\r\n\r\nNow the most interesting and best defined line near this azimuth on the\r\nOrdnance map is the one stretching S.E. from the centre of the Stenness\r\ncircle to the Barnstone, with an azimuth of 57° 15′. The line contains\r\nbetween the two points I have named another stone, the Watchstone, 18¹⁄₂\r\nfeet high, in the precise alignment; and from the statements made and\r\nmeasures given it is to be inferred that a still more famous and\r\nperforated stone, the “Stone of Odin,” demolished seventy years since,\r\nwas also in the same line within the extremities named.\r\n\r\nIf we may accept this we learn something about perforated stones, and\r\ncan understand most of the folk lore associated with them, and few have\r\nmore connected with them than the one at Stenness. I suggest that the\r\nperforation, which was in this case 5 feet from the ground, was used by\r\nthe astronomer-priest to view the sunrise in November over the Barnhouse\r\nstone in one direction, and the sunset in May over the circle in the\r\nother. I hope to be able to return to this question subsequently.\r\n\r\nThere is another echo of this fundamental line; that joining the Ring of\r\nBookan and the Stones of Via has the same azimuth and doubtless served\r\nthe same purpose for the May year.\r\n\r\nBut this line, giving us the May sunset and November sunrise, _not_ the\r\nDecember solstitial sunrise as Mr. Spence shows it, is not the only\r\norientation connected with the May year at the stones of Stenness. The\r\nNovember sunset is provided for by a sight-line from the circle to a\r\nstone across the Loch of Stenness with an azimuth of S. 53° 30′ W.\r\n\r\nTo apply the table, given on p. 120, to the solstitial risings and\r\nsettings at Stenness, and the sight-lines which I have plotted on the\r\nmap, it will be seen that the table shows us that the lines marked\r\n\r\n                  S. 41°  0′ E.\r\n  N. 41° 16′ E.   S. 36° 30′ W.\r\n\r\nare solstitial lines; to get exact agreement with the table the heights\r\nof the hills must be found and allowed for.\r\n\r\nI have roughly determined this height from the 1-inch map in the case of\r\nthe Barnstone-Maeshowe alignment. On the N.E. horizon are the Burrien\r\nHills, four miles away, 600 feet high at the sunrise place, gradually\r\nascending to the E., vertical angle = 1° 36′ 30″. The near alignment is\r\non and over the centre of Maeshowe. Colonel Johnston, the\r\nDirector-General of the Ordnance Survey, has informed me that the true\r\nazimuth of this bearing is N. 41° 16′ E., and in all probability it\r\nrepresents the place of sunrise as seen from the Barnstone when Maeshowe\r\nwas erected. What is most required in Orkney now is that some one with a\r\ngood 6-inch theodolite should observe the sun’s place of rising and the\r\nangular height of the hills at the next summer solstice in order to\r\ndetermine the date of the erection of Maeshowe. Mr. Spence and others\r\nmade an attempt to determine this value with a sextant in 1899, but not\r\nfrom the Barnstone.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of this observation we may use the diagram given on p.\r\n121. With the height of hill previously given the sun should rise\r\naccording to calculation at about the azimuth N. 41° 50′ E.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the new and old azimuth then, on the assumption\r\nthat az. N. 41° 16′ E. really represents an observation over Maeshowe,\r\ngives us the difference of date.\r\n\r\nTreating these figures then as we have done in the case of Stonehenge in\r\nChapter VII, the result is as follows. The Barnhouse-Maeshowe line was\r\nestablished about 700 B.C., when the obliquity had a value of 23° 48′\r\naccording to Stockwell’s tables. (Fig. 40.)\r\n\r\nI confess the late date does not surprise me. The masonry of Maeshowe\r\ndiffers widely from that of other similar structures in that the sides\r\nof the gallery and chamber, instead of being composed of upright stones,\r\nare built in regular courses.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the Maeshowe structure was built to observe a\r\nwinter sunrise twenty days from the solstice, nor can I think it was set\r\nup at midsummer by someone who had only dealt with a high sun and a sea\r\nhorizon, and imagined that the sunrise and sunset points were exactly\r\nopposite to each other. It was a priest’s house, and the alignment of\r\nthe passage to the Barnstone was for the exchange of signals, probably\r\nby lights in Maeshowe itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Variation of the Obliquity of the Ecliptic, 100\r\nA.D.-4000 B.C.

From bottom: 23.40-24.10.~]\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance maps give no indication of stones, &c., by which the\r\ndirection of the midsummer setting or the midwinter rising and setting\r\nmight have been indicated from either the Maeshowe or the Barnstone.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the solar alignments from the circle.\r\n\r\nWe have the May sunrise marked by the top of Burrien Hill, from 600 to\r\n700 feet high, Az. 59° 30′.\r\n\r\nWe have the November sunset marked by a standing stone on the other side\r\nof the Loch of Stenness, Az. 53° 30′.\r\n\r\nJune rising, Line from Barnstone over Maeshowe tumulus.\r\n\r\nDecember rising, tumulus (Az. 41°) on Ward Hill.\r\n\r\nDecember setting, tumulus Onston 36° 30′.\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable that the summer solstice rising and the\r\nwinter solstice rising and setting seem to have been provided for at the\r\nStenness circle by alignment on the centres of tumuli, two of them,\r\nacross the Loch, one the Onston tumulus to the S.W. (Az. 36° 30′), the\r\nother tumulus being on Ward Hill to the S.E., Az. 41° (rough\r\nmeasurement).\r\n\r\nIf the Maeshowe tumulus was a structure erected at the time I have\r\nsuggested to use the Barnstone for the summer solstice rising; then\r\nthese two other tumuli, to deal with the winter solstice at Stenness\r\ncircle, may have been built at the same time. All these provided for a\r\nnew cult.\r\n\r\nThere are also tumuli near the line (which cannot be exactly determined\r\nbecause the heights of the hills are unknown) of the summer solstice\r\nsetting; none was required for the sunrise at this date, as the line\r\npasses over the highest point of Hindera fiold, a natural tumulus more\r\nthan 500 feet high, and on that account a triangulation station.\r\n\r\nAnother argument in favour of the tumuli being additions to the original\r\ndesign is that the place of the _November_ setting from the Stenness\r\ncircle is marked, _not_ by a tumulus, but by a standing stone. As this\r\nstone, near Deepdale, and the tumulus at Onston are only about 1200\r\nyards apart, the suggestion may be made that under certain unknown\r\nconditions and possibly in later times tumuli in some cases replaced\r\nstones as collimation marks.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the clock-star, it is to be feared that the stones in the\r\nN.E. quadrant as viewed from the circle which might have given us a clue\r\nhave been removed. As the latitude of Stenness is N. 59°, some star with\r\na less declination than N. 31° would have been chosen, assuming that the\r\nsky-line towards the N. point is not very high.\r\n\r\n[20] See especially _Nature_, July 2, 1891, p. 201.\r\n\r\n[21] Gardner: Paisley and London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE HURLERS (Lat. 50° 31′ N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sight-lines to which I have drawn attention in relation to the\r\nstones of Stenness had to do with the places of sunrise and sunset in\r\nthe May and Solstitial years. I now pass to another group of circles in\r\nwhich we deal chiefly with the places of star-rise and star-set, some of\r\nthe stars being used as warners for sunrise at the critical times of the\r\ntwo years in question.\r\n\r\nFollowing the clue given me in the case of the Egyptian temples, such as\r\nLuxor, by successive small changes of the axis necessitated by the\r\nchange in a star’s place due to precession, I began this stellar branch\r\nof the inquiry by looking out for this peculiarity in an examination of\r\nmany maps and plans of circles.\r\n\r\nI very soon came across two examples in which the sight-line had been\r\nchanged in the Egyptian manner. The first is the three circles of the\r\nHurlers, some 5 miles to the north of Liskeard, a plan of which is given\r\nin “Prehistoric Stone Monuments of the British Isles: Cornwall,” by W.\r\nC. Lukis, Rector of Wath, Yorkshire, published by the Society of\r\nAntiquaries, who were so good as to furnish me with a copy, and also\r\nsome _unfolded_ plans on which sight-lines could be accurately drawn and\r\ntheir azimuths determined. I am anxious to express my obligations to the\r\ncouncil and officers of the society for the help thus afforded me.\r\n\r\nThe three circles are thus referred to by Lukis in the valuable\r\nmonograph which I have already mentioned.\r\n\r\n“On the moor, about a mile to the south of the singular pile of granite\r\nslabs, which rest upon and overlap each other, and is vulgarly called\r\nthe Cheesewring, there are three large circles of granite stones placed\r\nin a nearly straight line in a north-north-east, and south-south-west\r\ndirection, of which the middle one is the largest, being 135 feet in\r\ndiameter, the north 110 feet, and the south 105 feet.\r\n\r\n“The north Circle is 98 feet, and the south 82 feet from the central\r\none. If a line be drawn uniting the centres of the extreme Circles, the\r\ncentre of the middle ring is found to be 12 feet 6 inches to the west of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“These Circles have been greatly injured. The largest consists of 9\r\nerect and 5 prostrate stones; the north Circle has 6 erect and 6\r\nprostrate, and a fragment of a seventh; and the south has 3 erect and 8\r\nprostrate. In Dr. Borlase’s time they were in a slightly better\r\ncondition. A pen-and-ink sketch made by him, which is extant in one of\r\nDr. Stukeley’s volumes of original drawings, represents the middle\r\nCircle as consisting of 7 erect and 10 prostrate stones; the north of 10\r\nerect and 6 prostrate; and the south of 3 erect and 9 prostrate. The\r\nstone to the east of that marked C in the plan of the middle Circle is\r\nthe highest, and is 5 feet 8 inches out of the ground, and appears to\r\nhave been wantonly mutilated recently. Two of the prostrate stones of\r\nthe north Circle are 6 feet 6 inches in length.\r\n\r\n“About 17 feet south from the centre of the middle Circle there is a\r\nprostrate stone 4 feet long and 15 inches wide at one end. It may\r\npossibly have been of larger dimensions formerly, and been erected on\r\nthe spot where it now lies, but as Dr. Borlase has omitted it in his\r\nsketch it is probably a displaced stone of the ring.\r\n\r\n“If we allow, as before, an average interval of 12 feet between the\r\nstones, there will have been about 28 pillars in the north, 26 in the\r\nsouth, and 33 in the middle Circle.\r\n\r\n“At a distance of 409 feet westwards from K in the middle Circle there\r\nare 2 stones, 7 feet apart, both inclined northwards. One is 4 feet 11\r\ninches in height out of the ground, and overhangs its base 2 feet 7\r\ninches; the other is 5 feet 4 inches high, and overhangs 18 inches.”\r\n\r\nI now pass from a general description of the circles to the azimuths of\r\nthe sight-lines already referred to, so far as they can be determined\r\nfrom the published Ordnance maps.\r\n\r\nTo investigate them as completely as possible without local observations\r\nin the first instance, I begged Colonel Johnston, R.E., C.B., the\r\nDirector-General of the Ordnance Survey, to send me the 25-inch maps of\r\nthe site giving the exact azimuth of the side lines. This he obligingly\r\ndid, and I have to express my great indebtedness to him.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 41 I show the sight-lines from the south and north Circles as\r\ndetermined by the stones and barrows marked on the map. The sight-lines\r\non Arcturus are from the centres of the three circles in succession. I\r\nshall point out later the significance of the fact that the November\r\nalignments are from the south, the solstitial ones from the north\r\nCircle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--The Sight-lines at the Hurlers.]\r\n\r\nOf the various sight-lines found, those to which I wish to direct\r\nattention in the first instance, and which led me to the others, are\r\napproximately, reading the azimuths to the nearest degree,\r\n\r\n        Lat. 50° 31′ N.              Az.\r\n  S. circle to central circle     N. 12° E.\r\n  Central to N. circle            N. 15° E.\r\n  N. circle to tumulus            N. 19° E.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary inquiry in anticipation of the necessary local\r\nobservations with a theodolite, I assumed hills half a degree high, for\r\nthe reason given on p. 112. We have the following declinations\r\napproximately:--\r\n\r\n  Dec. N. 38¹⁄₂°\r\n    „     38°\r\n    „     37°\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have declinations to work on, but declinations of what\r\nstar? To endeavour to answer this question I studied the declinations of\r\nthe three brightest stars in the northern heavens, having approximately\r\nthe declinations in question some time or other during the period 0 to\r\n2500 B.C.\r\n\r\nVega is ruled out as its declination was too high. The remaining stars\r\nCapella and Arcturus may have been observed so far as the declinations\r\ngo. For time limits we have:--\r\n\r\n  Dec. N.     Capella.      Arcturus.\r\n  38¹⁄₂°       500 B.C.     1600 B.C.\r\n  36°         1050  „       1150  „\r\n\r\nNow there is no question as to which of these two stars we have to deal\r\nwith, for the northern circle is evidently less ancient than the\r\nothers, for some of the stones are squared and the others are less\r\nirregular than those in the S. circle.\r\n\r\nThis being so, the approximate dates of the use of the three circles at\r\nthe Hurlers can be derived. They are, with the above assumption:--\r\n\r\n                                                                  B.C.\r\n  Southern circle aligning Arcturus over centre of central circle 1600\r\n  Central        „             „          „        N. circle      1500\r\n  Northern       „             „          „        tumulus        1300\r\n\r\nThe next step was to obtain, by means of a large circular protractor,\r\nmore accurate readings of the Ordnance Map. This I could do, but the all\r\nimportant question of the angular height of the horizon remained. As it\r\nwas impossible for me to leave London when the significance of the\r\nalignments was made out, I appealed to the authorities of the Royal\r\nCornwall Polytechnic Society for aid in obtaining the necessary angles,\r\nand as a result, Captain J. S. Henderson, of Falmouth, an accomplished\r\nsurveyor, volunteered his aid and shortly sent me the angular heights\r\nalong some of the alignments, the means of eight readings obtained with\r\na 6-inch theodolite, both verniers and reversed telescopes being\r\nemployed. Other students of science besides myself will, I am sure, feel\r\ntheir indebtedness for such opportune help.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the large protractor and theodolite work gives the\r\nfollowing final values. The difference between them and the provisional\r\nones given above speaks volumes as to the necessity of a local study of\r\nthe height of the horizon, a point I believe invariably neglected by\r\narchæologists.\r\n\r\nFINAL VALUES.\r\n\r\n  _Arcturus from S. circle to central circle._\r\n\r\n  Az.

Many have been found of which more in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe next point which arose was that Arcturus used as a clock-star (p.\r\n108) would serve as a warner for August. This necessitated another\r\ninquiry into the chief festivals in Cornwall: among these the August\r\n(Harvest) festival is one.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider was whether there was any evidence of a local\r\nAugust festival. It happens that the Hurlers are in the parish of St.\r\nCleer, and some of the other Arcturus sight-lines are in that of St.\r\nJust. Now, a local festival in old days was often associated with the\r\nlocal Saint. As most of the Cornish Saints are common to Cornwall and\r\nBrittany, I looked up the Calendar of the _Annuaire_ of the _Institut de\r\nFrance_, and found that the days dedicated to SS. Justin and Claire are\r\nthe 9th and 12th of August. It seems, then, that at the Hurlers it was\r\nreally a question of a clock-star also used as a warning star for the\r\nAugust festival. I think we have at last, then, run to earth the origin\r\nof some of the northerly alignments referred to on pages 36 and 43.\r\n\r\nIt will have been noted that the last sight-line on Arcturus was marked\r\nby a barrow. Captain Henderson inspected it and found it much ruined by\r\nexplorers, remains of a chamber inside being visible.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent visit, in which Captain Henderson was accompanied by Mr.\r\nHorton Bolitho, my wife and myself, we not only visited this barrow, but\r\nfound that the whole hill had been honeycombed to such an extent by\r\nmining operations that it was very difficult to discriminate between\r\n“investigated” barrows and other heaps and holes, unless the barrow\r\nshowed the remains of a chamber.\r\n\r\nOur examination was not limited to barrows. Captain Henderson had spent\r\na long bleak day in examining and measuring the stones marked on the\r\nOrdnance Map, to which I had called his special attention. We went over\r\npart of the ground with him, and came to the conclusion that the whole\r\nquestion of the Cornish treatment of “ancient stones” would have to be\r\ngone into--an inquiry which Mr. Bolitho is now carrying on.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that any stone or barrow used in the sight-lines\r\nwe are now considering must have been put up nearly 4,000 years ago, so\r\nlong ago, in fact, that many of the chief barrows have been reduced to\r\nthe skeletons of their former selves, the enclosed stone chamber, built\r\nof mighty stones, alone remaining.\r\n\r\nCromlechs and standing stones then formed important points in the\r\nlandscape long before ecclesiastical divisions were thought of, or any\r\nattempt was made to indicate the boundaries of private property.\r\n\r\nWe should expect then to find these ancient monuments freely made use of\r\nto mark what we now term “parish boundaries.” This is so. Four parishes\r\nhave thus used one of the larger cromlechs, and it is more than probable\r\nthat something beside the denunciation of the _cultus lapidum_, which we\r\nhave seen at work in Brittany (p. 39), has been responsible for the many\r\nstone crosses in Cornwall. Of some of them near circles I have gathered\r\nthe astronomical use, while now they “mark the bounds,” as do some of\r\nthe stone rows in Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nI believe that in later times this practice of the Church was followed\r\nby those among whom the land was distributed, and this has gone on till\r\nat last there are many ancient stones trimmed on one side and bearing\r\ninitials and so having a modern appearance. The astronomer, and even the\r\narchæologist, may regret this practice, but as the habit in Cornwall\r\nappears to be for anybody to use the nearest uncrossed and uninitialled\r\nstone for a wall or a pigsty, Mr. Bolitho’s inquiry may show that in\r\nsome cases, at all events, it has been a blessing in disguise, for the\r\nstones are still there.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a long chambered barrow, the top of which nearly touches\r\nthe horizon, as seen from a circle near it, there is less danger of\r\nbeing misled.\r\n\r\nIn my notes on the stones of Stenness (Chapter XIII) I pointed out that\r\nthe chambered Cairns at Onston and Maeshowe suggested that such\r\nstructures were later variants of the more ancient standing stones. Some\r\nbarrows at the Hurlers lend further confirmation of this view. I will\r\ndeal with them first. Of one the data are Az. from N. Circle S. 72° 49′\r\nW., height of horizon 12′ (Capt. Henderson). The resulting declination\r\nis S. 11° 5′, the declination of Antares 1720 B.C. But why should\r\nAntares be thus singled out? The table on page 117 shows the reason. At\r\nthe date involved the setting of Antares in the dawn was the warner of\r\nthe sunrise on May morning, the greatest day in all the year.\r\n\r\nIs there any precedent for this use of Antares?\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out (p. 108) that Mr. Penrose found the warning\r\nstars for May morning at the dates of foundation of the Hecatompedon,\r\nand the older Erechtheum, to be the group of the Pleiades rising and\r\n_Antares_ setting. As the foundations of the Hecatompedon were built\r\nonly some few years after the stones of the central circle of the\r\nHurlers were used, we ought to find traces of the observations of the\r\nsame May-morning stars.\r\n\r\nWe have, then, now a third term in the astronomical use of stars to\r\nherald the sunrise on May morning.\r\n\r\n  Temple of Min            Thebes    3200 B.C.  Spica.\r\n  Temple at the Hurlers    Liskeard  1720  „    Antares.\r\n  Older Erechtheum         Athens    1070  „       „\r\n\r\nThe next barrow to be referred to--it is shown to be a long one on the\r\nOrdnance Map--is situated near the top of Caradon Hill, and is visible\r\non the sky-line from the circles. Data: Az. from N. Circle S. 65° E.,\r\nheight of horizon 1° 38′ (Henderson). This corresponds almost exactly\r\nwith the azimuth of the rise of the sun’s upper limb with declination S.\r\n16° 20′ on the two critical dates in November and February of the\r\nMay-year (Halloween and Candlemas, see p. 23), so I am inclined to\r\nconsider it more than a mere coincidence that the azimuths coincide so\r\nclosely. It, however, may be urged that there are other barrows on\r\nCaradon Hill, but judging from the Ordnance Map they seem to be of the\r\nround variety used for burials, perhaps a thousand years after the\r\ncircles were in use, and in my opinion by a different race of men; but\r\nthis matter must not detain us now, I hope to return to it later.\r\n\r\nStill one more barrow and a stone, uncrossed and uninitialled, in the\r\nsame sight-line, data: Az. from N. circle S. 59° 35′ E. Height of\r\nhorizon 1° 38′ 23″ (Henderson), resulting declination S. 19° 50′. This\r\nwas the declination of Sirius 1690 B.C. Why Sirius? The table on p. 117\r\ngives us the answer. Sirius replaced Arcturus as a warning star for the\r\nAugust festival, and we have seen that the last use of Arcturus was\r\nconnected with the sight-line to the barrow about 1900 B.C.\r\n\r\nI pass now from barrows to stones. There is one about which there can be\r\nno question. It is a famous Cross, a “Longstone” at which all travellers\r\nstop on their way from St. Cleer to the Hurlers. It occupies nearly the\r\nsame position on the S.W. horizon as does the long tumulus on Caradon\r\nHill in the S.E. quadrant. From the _South_ Circle, and this is\r\nimportant, its Azimuth, S. 64° W., is nearly the same; it marked, and\r\nstill marks, the sunset point on the critical days of the May year in\r\nNovember and February.\r\n\r\nThere is another stone marked on the Ordnance Map Az. N. 88° E. from the\r\nN. circle. It has been removed, so I may fairly assume that it was\r\nreally an ancient stone. Captain Henderson’s value for the height of the\r\nhorizon is 11′ 31″. The table on p. 117 will show that in this direction\r\nwe have to deal with Betelgeuse as a warner for the summer solstice. The\r\nresulting date is 1730 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that possibly this is not the only stone dealing with\r\n(later) solstitial alignments. Lukis gives two stones on the west side\r\nof the circles which on the Ordnance Map are classed as boundary stones:\r\nthey lie on a boundary beyond all question, but also beyond all question\r\nthey are as ancient as the stones of the circles themselves. From the N.\r\ncircle they are almost but not quite in a line, and the azimuth of the\r\nsouth stone is S. 49° W. This is a solstitial azimuth. I think,\r\ntherefore, that we may accept this as another evidence of the worship of\r\nthe setting sun at the winter solstice, _from the N. circle_, and in\r\nthis we have still further evidence that to the worship of the May year\r\nin the south circle was added later one dealing with the solstitial year\r\nwhich was chiefly carried on in the N. circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE DARTMOOR AVENUES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XI. I referred to the very numerous alignments of stones in\r\nBrittany, and I was allowed by Lieutenant Devoir, of the French Navy, to\r\ngive some of his theodolite observations of the directions along which\r\nthe stones had been set up.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was that we were really dealing with monuments connected\r\nwith the worship of the sun of the May year, a year which the recent\r\nevidence has shown to have been the first used after the length of the\r\nyear had been determined; thus replacing the lunar unit of time which\r\nwas in vogue previously, and the use of which is brought home to us by\r\nthe reputed ages of Methuselah and other biblical personages, who knew\r\nno other measurer of time than the moon.\r\n\r\nThere was also evidence to the effect that in later times solstitial\r\nalignments had been added, so that the idea that we were dealing with\r\nastronomically oriented rows of stones was greatly strengthened, not to\r\nsay established.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Brittany alignments were things of mystery, their origin,\r\nas well as that of the more or less similar monuments in Britain, was\r\nvariously explained; they were models in stone of armies in battle\r\narray, or they represented funeral processions, to mention only two\r\nsuggestions. I should add that Mr. H. Worth, who has devoted much time\r\nto their study, considers that some sepulchral interest attaches to\r\nthem, though he thinks it may be argued that that was secondary, even as\r\nare interments in cathedrals and churches. About burials associated with\r\nthem, of course, there is no question, for the kistvaens and cairns are\r\nthere; but my observations suggest that they were added long after the\r\navenues were built, because some cairns _block_ avenues. Perhaps a\r\ncareful study of the modes of burial adopted may throw light on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe equivalents of the Brittany alignments are not common in Britain;\r\nthey exist in the greatest number on Dartmoor, whither I went recently\r\nto study them. The conditions on high Dartmoor are peculiar; dense\r\nblinding mists are common, and, moreover, sometimes come on almost\r\nwithout warning. From its conformation the land is full of streams.\r\nThere are stones everywhere. What I found, therefore, as had others\r\nbefore me, was that as a consequence of the conditions to which I have\r\nreferred, directions had been indicated by rows of stones for quite\r\nother than ceremonial purposes. Here, then, was another possible origin.\r\nIt was a matter of great importance to discriminate most carefully\r\nbetween these alignments, and to endeavour to sort them out. My special\r\ninquiry, of course, was to see if they, like their apparent equivalents\r\nin Brittany, could have had an astronomical origin. The first thing to\r\ndo, then, was to see which might have been erected for worship or which\r\nfor practical purposes.\r\n\r\nIn doing this there is no difficulty in dealing with extremes. Thus one\r\nnotable line of large flat stones has been claimed by Messrs. R. N.\r\nWorth and R. Burnard as a portion of the Great Fosseway (Rowe’s\r\n_Perambulation_, third edition, p. 63); it has been traced for eighteen\r\nmiles from beyond Hameldon nearly to Tavistock, the stones being about 2\r\nfeet thick and the road 10 feet wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo. by Lady Lockyer._\r\n\r\nFIG. 42.--The Southern Avenue at Merrivale, looking East.]\r\n\r\nThere are two notable avenues of upright stones at Merrivale; they are\r\nin close connection with a circle, and could have had no practical use.\r\nThese stones, then, we may claim as representing the opposite extreme of\r\nthe Fosseway and as suggesting an astronomical, as opposed to a\r\npractical, use; the adjacent circle, of course greatly strengthens this\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIt is between these extremes that difficulties may arise, but the\r\nverdict can, in a great many cases at all events, be settled without any\r\nvery great hesitation, especially where practical or astronomical\r\nuselessness can be established. But even here care is necessary, as I\r\nshall show.\r\n\r\nThe stones now in question, originally upright, are variously called\r\navenues, rows, alignments or parallelithons. Their study dates from\r\n1827, when Rowe and Colonel Hamilton Smith examined those at Merrivale\r\n(Rowe, _op. cit._, p. 31). Their number has increased with every careful\r\nstudy of any part of the moor, and doubtless many are still\r\nunmapped.[22] The late Mr. R. N. Worth, of Plymouth, and his son, Mr. H.\r\nWorth, have given great attention to these monuments, and the former\r\ncommunicated a paper on them to the Devonshire Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science in 1892 (_Trans._, xxv. pp. 387-417).\r\n\r\nA word of caution must be said before I proceed. We must not take for\r\ngranted that the stone-rows are now as they left the hands of the\r\nbuilders. The disastrous carelessness of the Government in the matter of\r\nour national antiquities is, I am locally informed, admirably imitated\r\nby the Devonshire County and other lesser councils, and, indeed, by\r\nanybody who has a road to mend or a wall to build. On this account, any\r\nof the rows may once have been much longer and with an obvious practical\r\nuse; and those which now appear to be far removed from circles may once\r\nhave been used for sacred processions at shrines which have disappeared.\r\n\r\nAgain, the rows of stones we are now considering must not be confounded\r\nwith the “track lines” or “boundary banks” which are so numerous on\r\nDartmoor, and are represented in Wiltshire according to Sir R. C. Hoare;\r\nthese serve for bounds and pathways, and for connecting and enclosing\r\nfields or houses.\r\n\r\nDealing, then, with stone rows or avenues, which may be single, double,\r\nor multiple; any which are very long and crooked, following several\r\ndirections, are certainly not astronomical; and it is easy to see in\r\nsome cases that they might have been useful guides at night or in mist\r\nin difficult country with streams to cross. This possible utility must\r\nnot be judged wholly by the present conformation of the ground or the\r\npresent beds of streams.\r\n\r\nFor multiple avenues it is hard to find practical uses such as the\r\nabove, and we know how such avenues were used in Brittany for sun\r\nworship. Mr. Baring Gould considers there were eight rows in an avenue\r\non Challacombe Down 528 feet long; of these only three rows remain, the\r\nothers being represented by single stones here and there (Rowe, p. 33).\r\nI shall have something to say about this avenue further on.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have said, long rows bending in various directions are\r\nnot likely to have had an astronomical origin, it must not be assumed\r\nthat all astronomical avenues must be _exactly_ straight. This, of\r\ncourse, would be true for level ground, but if the avenue has to pass\r\nover ridges and furrows, the varying height of the horizon must be\r\nreckoned with, and therefore the azimuth of the avenue at any point\r\nalong it.\r\n\r\nI think it possible that in the Stalldon Moor row we have the mixture of\r\nreligious and practical intention at which I have before hinted. Both\r\nMr. Lukis and Mr. Hansford Worth have studied this monument, which is\r\ntwo miles and a quarter long. There is a circle at the south end about\r\n60 feet in diameter, while at its northern end there is a cairn.\r\n\r\nWhere the line starts from the circle the direction of the row is\r\nparallel to many sight-lines in Cornwall, and Arcturus would rise in the\r\nazimuth indicated. But this direction is afterwards given up for one\r\nwhich leads towards an important collection of hut circles, and it\r\ncrosses the Erme, no doubt at the most convenient spot. More to the\r\nnorth it crosses another stream and the bog of Red Lake. All this is\r\nsurely practical enough, although the way indicated might have been\r\nfollowed by the priests of the hut circles to the stone circle to\r\nprepare the morning sacrifice and go through the ritual.\r\n\r\nBut there is still another method of discrimination. If any of these\r\navenues were used at all for purposes of worship, their azimuths should\r\nagree with those already found in connection with circles in other parts\r\nof Britain, for we need not postulate a special race with a special cult\r\nlimited to Dartmoor; and in my inquiries what I have to do is to\r\nconsider the general question of orientation wherever traces of it can\r\nbe found. The more the evidences coincide the better it is for the\r\nargument, while variations afford valuable tests.\r\n\r\nNow, speaking very generally (I have not yet compared all my numerous\r\nnotes), in Cornwall the chief alignments from the circles there are with\r\nazimuths N. 10°-20° E. watching the rise of the clock-star, N. 64°-68°\r\nE. watching the rise of the May sun, N. 75°-82° E. watching the rise of\r\nthe Pleiades. The variation in the azimuths is largely due to the\r\ndifferent heights of the horizon towards which the sight-lines are\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion I have come to is that these alignments, depending upon\r\ncircles and menhirs in Cornwall, are all well represented on Dartmoor\r\nassociated with the avenues; and further, so far as I have learned at\r\npresent, in the case of the avenues connected with circles, there are\r\nnot many alignments I have not met with in connection with circles in\r\nCornwall and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis is not only a _prima facie_ argument in favour of the astronomical\r\nuse underlying the structures, but it is against the burial theory, for\r\ncertainly there must have been burials in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nIn order, therefore, to proceed with the utmost caution, I limit myself\r\nin the first instance to the above azimuths, and will begin by applying\r\na test which should be a rigid one.\r\n\r\nIf the avenues on Dartmoor had to deal with the same practices and cults\r\nas did the circles in Cornwall, they ought to prove themselves to have\r\nbeen in use at _about_ the same time, and from this point of view the\r\ninvestigation of the avenues becomes of very great importance, because\r\nof the destruction of circles and menhirs which has been going on, and\r\nis still going on, on Dartmoor. We have circles without menhirs and\r\nmenhirs without circles, so that the azimuths of the avenues alone\r\nremain to give us any chance of dating the monuments if they were used\r\nin connection with star worship. The case is far different in Cornwall,\r\nwhere both circles and menhirs have in many cases been spared.\r\n\r\nOn Dartmoor, where in some cases the menhirs still remain, they have\r\nbeen annexed as crosses and perhaps as boundary stones, and squared and\r\ninitialed; hence the Ordnance surveyors have been misled, and they are\r\nnot shown as ancient stones on the map. In some cases the azimuth of the\r\nstones suggests that this has been the sequence of events.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the above that I have not tackled a question full\r\nof pitfalls without due caution, and this care was all the more\r\nnecessary as the avenues have for long been the meeting ground of the\r\nfriends and foes of what Rowe calls “Druidical speculations”; even yet\r\nthe war rages, and my writing and Lieut. Devoir’s observing touching the\r\nsimilar but grander avenues of Brittany have so far been all in vain;\r\nchiefly, I think, because no discrimination has been considered possible\r\nbetween different uses of avenues, and because the statements made by\r\narchæologists as to their direction have been quite useless to anybody\r\nin consequence of their vagueness, and last of all because the recent\r\nwork on the Brittany remains is little known.\r\n\r\nI began my acquaintance with the Dartmoor monuments by visiting\r\nMerrivale, and the result of my inquiries there left absolutely no doubt\r\nwhatever on my mind. I was armed, thanks to the kindness of Colonel\r\nJohnston, the Director of the Ordnance Survey, with the 25-inch map,\r\nwhile Mr. Hansford Worth had been so good as to send me one showing his\r\nspecial survey.\r\n\r\nThe Merrivale avenues (lat. 50° 33′ 15″) are composed of two double\r\nrows, roughly with the azimuth N. 82° E.; the northern row is shorter\r\nthan the other. Rowe, in his original description (1830), makes the\r\nnorthern 1143 feet long; they are not quite parallel, and the southern\r\nrow has a distinct “kink” or change of direction in it at about the\r\ncentre. The stones are mostly 2 or 3 feet high, and in each row they are\r\nabout 3 feet apart; the distance between the rows is about 80 feet.\r\n\r\nI have before pointed out (p. 149) that an avenue directed to the rising\r\nplace of a star, if it is erected over undulating ground, cannot be\r\nstraight. I may now mention another apparent paradox. If two avenues are\r\ndirected to the rising place of the same star _at different times_, they\r\ncannot be parallel. It is not a little curious that absence of\r\nparallelism has been used against avenues having had an astronomical\r\nuse!\r\n\r\nBoth the Ordnance surveyors and Mr. Worth have shown the want of\r\nparallelism of the two avenues, and Mr. Worth has noted the kink in the\r\nsouthern one. The height of the horizon, as determined from my measures,\r\nis 3° 18′. The results of these inquiries, assuming the Pleiades to have\r\nbeen observed warning May morning, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Azimuth.   Authority.   N. Declination.   Date B.C.\r\n       °                      °  ′  ″\r\n  N. 83·15 E.    Worth        6 47 47          1710\r\n     82·30       Worth        7 16 20          1630\r\n     82·10      Ordnance      7 32  0          1580\r\n     80·40       Worth        8 26  0          1420\r\n     80·30      Ordnance      8 30  0          1400\r\n\r\nTo simplify matters we may deal with the Ordnance values and neglect the\r\nsmall change of direction in the southern avenue. We have, then, the two\r\ndates 1580 B.C. and 1420 B.C. for the two avenues. The argument for the\r\nPleiades is strengthened by the fact that at Athens the Hecatompedon was\r\noriented to these stars in 1495 B.C. according to Mr. Penrose’s\r\ndetermination of the azimuth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Plan, from the Ordnance Map, showing the\r\navenues, circle and stones at Merrivale, with their azimuths.]\r\n\r\nNow this is not the first time I have referred to avenues in these\r\nnotes. The azimuth of one at Stonehenge was used to fix the date at\r\nwhich sun worship went on there. That avenue, unlike the Dartmoor ones,\r\nwas built of earth, and it is not alone. There is another nearly two\r\nmiles long called the Cursus. So far, I have found no solstitial worship\r\non Dartmoor, so there are no avenues parallel to the one at Stonehenge\r\nleading N.E. from the temple. But how about the other? _It is roughly\r\nparallel to the avenues at Merrivale, and I think, therefore, was, like\r\nthem, used as a processional road, a via sacra, to watch the rising of\r\nthe Pleiades._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Reprint of Ordnance Map showing that the Cursus\r\nat Stonehenge is nearly parallel to the Merrivale Avenue. The azimuth is\r\n82° and not 84° as shown in the figure.]\r\n\r\nI said roughly parallel; its azimuth is about the same (N. 82° E.\r\nroughly); but the horizon is only about 1° high; it was therefore in use\r\nbefore those at Merrivale; the exact date of use must wait for\r\ntheodolite values of the height of the horizon, but in the meantime we\r\ncan see from the above estimates that the declination of the Pleiades\r\nwas about N. 5° 28′ 30″ and the date of use 1950 B.C., that is some 300\r\nyears before the solstitial restoration.\r\n\r\nMr. Worth’s survey gives another line of stones. It is undoubtedly, I\r\nthink, an ancient line, although it is not shown in the Ordnance map, a\r\nclear indication of the difficulty of discriminating these avenues on\r\nland cumbered with stones in all directions. Its azimuth is N. 24° 25′\r\nE., and the height of the horizon 5° 10′. This gives us Arcturus at the\r\ndate 1860 B.C., showing that, as at the Hurlers, Arcturus was used as a\r\nclock-star. Hence a possible _astronomical_ use is evident, while this\r\nrow, like the others, could have been of no _practical_ use to anybody.\r\nIt is interesting to note that this single row of stones is older than\r\nthe double ones; this seems natural.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to say a word as to the different treatment of the\r\nends of the south avenue now that it seems probable that it was used to\r\nwatch the rising of the Pleiades. At the east end there is what\r\narchæologists term a “blocking stone”; these observations suggest that\r\nit was really a _sighting_ stone. At the west end such a stone is\r\nabsent, but the final stones in the avenue are longer than the rest.\r\nThis may help us in the true direction of the sight-lines in other\r\navenues; and, indeed, I shall show in the sequel that this consideration\r\naffords a criterion which, in the cases I have come across, is entirely\r\nin harmony with others.\r\n\r\n[22] On June 15, 1905, that excellent guide of the Chagford part of the\r\nmoor, Mr. S. Perrott, showed me an avenue (Azimuth N. 20° E. true) near\r\nHurston Ridge which is not given in the 1-inch map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE DARTMOOR AVENUES (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\nMy inquiries began at Merrivale because there is a circle associated\r\nwith the avenues a little to the south of the west end of the longest;\r\nand again nearly, or quite, south of this there is a fine menhir,\r\npossibly used to give a north-south line. There is another menhir given\r\non the Ordnance map, azimuth N. 70° 30′ E., which, with hills 3° high,\r\npoints out roughly the place of sunrise from the circle in May (April\r\n29). Although this stone has been squared and initialed, I think I am\r\njustified in claiming it as an ancient monument. There is still another,\r\nazimuth N. 83° E., giving a line from the circle almost parallel to the\r\navenue. I hope some local archæologist will examine it, for if ancient\r\nit will tell us whether the N. avenue or the circle was built first, a\r\npoint of which it is difficult to overrate the importance, as it will\r\nshow the strict relationship between the astronomy of the avenues and\r\nthat of the circle, and we can now, I think, deal with the astronomical\r\nuse of circles after the results obtained at Stonehenge, Stenness and\r\nthe Hurlers as an accepted fact. With the above approximate values the\r\ndate comes out 1750 B.C., the declination of the Pleiades being N. 6°\r\n35′.\r\n\r\nI now pass on from Merrivale as an example of those avenues the\r\ndirection of which lies somewhere in the E.-W. direction. Others which I\r\nhave not seen, given by Rowe, are at Assacombe, Drizzlecombe and\r\nTrowlesworthy; to these Mr. Worth adds Harter or Har Tor (or Black Tor).\r\n\r\nThe avenues which lie nearly N. and S. are more numerous. Rowe gives the\r\nfollowing:--Fernworthy, Challacombe, Trowlesworthy, Stalldon Moor,\r\nBattendon, Hook Lake, and Tristis Rock. Of these I have visited the\r\nfirst two, as well as one on Shovel Down not named by Rowe, and the next\r\ntwo I have studied on the 6-inch Ordnance map.\r\n\r\n_Fernworthy_ (lat. 50° 38′).--Here are two avenues, one with azimuth N.\r\n15° 45′ E., hills 1° 15′. There is a sighting stone at the N. end. We\r\nappear to be dealing with Arcturus as clock-star 1610 B.C. This is about\r\nthe date of the erection of the N. avenue at Merrivale.\r\n\r\nThe second avenue has its sighting stone built into a wall at the south\r\nend. Looking south along the avenue, the conditions are azimuth S. 8°\r\n42′ W., hills 3° 30′.\r\n\r\nBoth these avenues are aligned on points within, but _not_ at the centre\r\nof, the circle.\r\n\r\n_Challacombe_ (lat. 50° 36′).--This is a case of a triple avenue,\r\nprobably the remains of eight rows, in a depression between two hills,\r\nChallacombe Down and Warrington. There is no circle. The azimuth is 23°\r\n37′ N.W. or S.E., according to direction. The northern end has been\r\ndestroyed by an old stream work; there is no blocking stone to the south\r\non either of the remaining avenues, but one large menhir terminates one\r\nrow of stones. The others may have been removed. So it is probable that\r\nthe alignment was to the north. If so, we are dealing with the setting\r\nof Arcturus, warning the summer solstice sunrise in 1860 B.C. To the S.\r\nthe hills are 4° 48′, to the N. 4° 50′.\r\n\r\nTo this result some importance must be attached, first, because it\r\nbrings us into presence of the cult of the solstitial year, secondly,\r\nbecause it shows us that the system most in vogue in Brittany was\r\nintroduced in relation to that year. In Brittany, as I have before\r\nshown, the complicated alignments, there are 11 parallel rows at Le\r\nMénac (p. 99) (there _were_ 8 parallel rows at Challacombe), were set up\r\nto watch the May and August sunrises, and the solstitial alignments came\r\nafterwards. The Brittany May alignments, therefore, were probably used\r\nlong before 1860 B.C., the date we have found for Challacombe, where not\r\nthe sunrise but the setting star which gave warning of it was observed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--The remains of the eight rows of the\r\nChallacombe Avenue. Looking North of East. Terminal Menhir on the\r\nextreme right.]\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to point out that at Challacombe, as elsewhere, the\r\npriest-astronomers so located their monuments that the nearly\r\ncircumpolar stars which were so useful to them should rise over an\r\nhorizon of some angular height. In this way the direction-lines would be\r\navailable for a longer period of time, for near the north point the\r\nchange of azimuth with change in the declination of the star observed is\r\nvery rapid.\r\n\r\n_Shovel Down_, near Batworthy (lat. 50° 39′ 20″).--A group of five rows\r\nof stones, four double, one single, with two sets of azimuths.\r\n\r\nOne set gives az. 22° 25°, and 28°. They seem to be associated. I will\r\ncall them A, B, and C. A is directed to the circle on Godleigh Common.\r\nIts ends are free. B is a single line of stones to the E. of the triple\r\ncircle, about which more presently. It is not marked on the Ordnance\r\nmap; its ends are also free. C has its south end blocked, I think in\r\nlater times, by a kistvaen. The astronomical direction may be,\r\ntherefore, either N.W. or S.E. We find a probable use in the N.W.\r\nquadrant, as at Challacombe, Arcturus setting at daybreak as a warner of\r\nthe summer solstice.\r\n\r\nThe height of hills is 46′; we have then:--\r\n\r\n     Az.        N. Dec.        Star.    Date.\r\n  N. 22° W.   36° 19′ 40″   Arcturus   1210 B.C.\r\n  N. 25° W.   35° 23′ 20″       „      1040  „\r\n  N. 28° W.   34° 19′ 30″       „       850  „\r\n\r\nAdjacent to A, B, C, is another avenue, which I will call D. Unlike the\r\nothers, its northern end points 2° E. of N. Its southern end is blocked\r\nby a remarkable triple circle, the end of the avenue close to it being\r\ndefined by two tall terminal stones. We are justified, then, in thinking\r\nthat its orientation was towards the north; the height of the horizon I\r\nmeasured as 45′. It may have been an attempt to mark the N. point of\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nThe triple circle to which I have referred is not an ordinary circle. I\r\nbelieve it to be a later added, much embellished, cairn. According to\r\nOrmerod, the diameters are 26, 20, and 3 feet, and there are three small\r\nstones at the centre.\r\n\r\nAll the above avenues are on the slope of the hill to the north. On the\r\nsouth slope we find the longest of all, as shown on the Ordnance map\r\nsurvey of 1885. There is a “long stone” in its centre, and at the\r\nsouthern end was formerly a cromlech, the “three boys.” Part of this\r\navenue, and two of the three “boys,” have been taken to build a wall.\r\nThe long stone remains, because it is a boundary stone!\r\n\r\nThe azimuth is 2° 30′ W. of north or E. of south. Looking N. from the\r\nlong stone, the height of the horizon is 2° 30′. I think this avenue was\r\nan attempt to mark the S. point.\r\n\r\n_Trowlesworthy_ (lat. 50° 27′ 30″).--The remains here are most\r\ninteresting. This is the only monument on Dartmoor in which I have so\r\nfar traced any attempt to locate the sun’s place at rising either for\r\nthe May or solstitial year. But I will deal with the N.-S. avenue first,\r\nas it is this feature which associates it with Fernworthy and\r\nChallacombe.\r\n\r\nAs at Merrivale, the avenue has a decided “kink” or change of direction.\r\nThe facts as gathered from the 6-inch map are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                        Az.     Hills.   Dec. N.       Star.

From the Ordnance map.]\r\n\r\nThis date is very nearly that of the use of the S. circle at the\r\nHurlers, and it is early for Dartmoor; but it is quite possible that\r\nlocal observations on an associated avenue a little to the west of the\r\ncircle which terminates the N.-S. avenue will justify it. This is not\r\nfar from parallel to that at Merrivale, but its northern azimuth is\r\ngreater, so that if it turns out to have been aligned on the Pleiades\r\nits date will be some time before that of Merrivale, that is, before\r\n1580 B.C. I can say nothing more about it till I have visited it.\r\n\r\nThe new features to which I have referred are two tumuli which in all\r\nprobability represent more recent additions to the original scheme of\r\nobservation, as we have found at Stenness, and show that Trowlesworthy\r\nwas for long one of the chief centres of worship on Dartmoor. Their\r\nazimuths are S. 64° E. and S. 49° W., dealing, therefore, with the May\r\nyear sunrises in November and February and the solstitial sunset in\r\nDecember. It is probable that, as at the Hurlers, tumuli were used\r\ninstead of stones not earlier than 1900 B.C.\r\n\r\n_Stalldon Moor_ (lat. 50° 27′ 45″) I have already incidentally referred\r\nto. The azimuth of the stone row as it leaves the circle, _not_ from its\r\ncentre as I read the 6-inch map, is N. 3° E.; as the azimuth gradually\r\nincreases for a time, we may be dealing with Arcturus, but local\r\nobservation is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the Cornish and Dartmoor monuments give much\r\nfood for thought, and it is to be hoped that they will be carefully\r\nstudied by future students of orientation, as so many questions are\r\nsuggested. I will refer to some of them.\r\n\r\n(1) Are the avenues, chiefly consisting of two rows of stones, a\r\nreflection of the sphinx avenues of Egypt? and, if so, how can the\r\nintensification of them on Dartmoor be explained?\r\n\r\n(2) Was there a double worship going on in the avenues and the circles\r\nat the same time? If not, why were the former not aligned on the\r\ncircles? On a dead level, of course, if the avenues were aligned on the\r\ncentre of the circle towards the rising or setting of the sun or a star,\r\nthe procession in the _via sacra_ would block the view of those in the\r\ncircle. We have the avenue at Stonehenge undoubtedly aligned on the\r\ncentre of the circle, but there the naos was on an eminence, so that the\r\nprocession in the avenue was always below the level of the horizon, and\r\nso did not block the view.\r\n\r\n(3) Do all the cairns and cists in the avenues represent later\r\nadditions, so late, indeed, that they may have been added after the\r\navenues had ceased to be used for ceremonial purposes? The cairn at\r\nnearly the central point of the S. avenue at Merrivale was certainly not\r\nthere as a part of the structure when the avenue was first used as a\r\n_via sacra_ for observing the rising of the Pleiades. I have always held\r\nthat these ancient temples, and even their attendant long and chambered\r\nbarrows, were for the living and not for the dead, and this view has\r\nbeen strengthened by what I have observed on Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nThere was good reason for burials after the sacred nature of the spot\r\nhad been established, and they may have taken place at any time since;\r\nthe most probable time being after 1000 B.C. up to a date as recent as\r\narchæologists may consider probable.\r\n\r\nMr. Worth, whose long labours on the Dartmoor avenues give such\r\nimportance to his opinions, objects to the astronomical use of those\r\navenues because there are so many of them; he informs me that he knows\r\nof 50; I think this objection may be considered less valid if the\r\navenues show that they were dedicated to different uses, some practical\r\nand others sacred, at different times of the year. For instance,\r\nChallacombe is not a duplicate of Merrivale; one is solstitial, the\r\nother deals with the May year; and a complete examination of them--I\r\nhave only worked on the fringe--may show other differences having the\r\nsame bearing.\r\n\r\nIn favour of the astronomical view it must be borne in mind that the\r\nresults obtained in Devon and Cornwall are remarkably similar, and the\r\ndates are roughly the same. Among the whole host of heaven from which\r\nobjectors urge it is free for me to select any star I choose, at present\r\nonly six stars have been considered, two of which were certainly used,\r\nas in Egypt, as clock-stars as they just dipped below the northern\r\nhorizon, and other two afterwards at Athens; and these six stars are\r\nshown by nothing more recondite than an inspection of a precessional\r\nglobe to have been precisely the stars, the “morning stars,” wanted by\r\nthe priest-astronomers who wished to be prepared for the instant of\r\nsunrise at the critical points of the May or solstitial year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSTANTON DREW (Lat. 51° 10′ N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOther circles to which I have given some attention are at Stanton Drew\r\nin Somerset. I regret to say that I have not as yet had an opportunity\r\nof visiting them. But a cursory inspection on the Ordnance map of the\r\npossible sight-lines from circle to circle, for there are three,\r\nsuggested at once that we were dealing with the same problem as that\r\nworked out, if somewhat differently, at the Hurlers.\r\n\r\nThe three circles, two avenues leading from two of the circles towards\r\nthe river, and some outstanding stones were most carefully surveyed by\r\nMr. C. E. Dymond some years ago. He was good enough to send me copies of\r\nhis plans and levelling sections. I have not had the advantage of\r\nperusing his memoir, but I have studied the monuments as well as I could\r\nby means of the 25-inch Ordnance map. This, combined with an azimuth\r\nwhich Colonel Johnston, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey, was\r\nkind enough to send me, should give me bearings within a degree.\r\n\r\nI will begin by giving a short account of the stones which remain,\r\nabridged from the convenient pamphlet prepared for the British\r\nAssociation meeting at Bristol in 1898 by Prof. Lloyd Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe circles at Stanton Drew, though far less imposing than those of\r\nAvebury and Stonehenge, are thought to be more ancient than are the\r\nlatter, for the rough-hewn uprights and plinths of Stonehenge bear the\r\nmarks of a higher and presumably later stage of mechanical development.\r\nTaken as a group, the Somersetshire circles are in some respects more\r\ncomplex than their better known rivals in Wiltshire. There are three\r\ncircles, from two of which “avenues” proceed for a short distance in a\r\nmore or less easterly direction; there is a shattered but large\r\ndolmen--if we may so regard the set of stones called “the cove”; and\r\nthere are outlying stones--the “quoit,” and those in Middle Ham--which\r\nbear such relations to the circles as to suggest that they too formed\r\nparts of some general scheme of construction.\r\n\r\nFrom the photograph of the Ordnance map (Fig. 47) it will be seen, as\r\npointed out by Prof. Lloyd Morgan,\r\n\r\n(1) That the centre of the great circle, that of the S.W. circle, and\r\nthat of the quoit, are nearly in the same straight line.\r\n\r\n(2) That the cove, the centre of the great circle, and that of the N.E.\r\ncircle, are nearly in the same straight line.\r\n\r\nThe quoit, which generally means the covering stone of a\r\ncromlech--“Hautville’s Quoit,” as it is named on the Ordnance map--looms\r\nlarge in Stanton Drew tradition; it is locally as much respected as the\r\ncircles themselves. It is pointed to most unmistakably by the fact that\r\na line from it to the S.W. circle passes nearly through the centre of\r\nthe great circle.\r\n\r\nIf the observation line, then, meant anything astronomically, it can\r\nonly have had to do with the rising of a star far to the north, in a\r\nposition far more northerly than the sun ever reaches.\r\n\r\nThe “quoit,” lying in an orchard by the roadside, has nothing very\r\nimpressive about its appearance--a recumbent mass of greyish sandstone;\r\nbut it seems to be a brick in the Stanton Drew building. By some\r\nregarded as a sarsen block from Wiltshire, it is, in Prof. Lloyd\r\nMorgan’s opinion, more probably derived from the Old Red Sandstone of\r\nMendip. In any case it is not, geologically speaking, _in situ_; nor has\r\nit reached its present position by natural agency.\r\n\r\nWith regard to two of the megalithic circles, at first sight the\r\nconstituent stones seem irregularly dotted about the field; but as we\r\napproach them the unevenly spaced stones group themselves.\r\n\r\nThe material of which the greater number of the rude blocks is composed\r\nis peculiar and worthy of careful examination. It is a much altered rock\r\nconsisting, in most of the stones, of an extremely hard siliceous\r\nbreccia with angular fragments embedded in a red or deep brown matrix,\r\nand with numerous cavities which give it a rough slaggy appearance. Many\r\nof these hollows are coated internally with a jasper-like material, the\r\ncentral cavity being lined with gleaming quartz-crystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--The Circles and Avenues at Stanton Drew.\r\nPhotograph of 25-inch Ordnance map, shewing approximate azimuths of\r\nsight-lines.]\r\n\r\nThe majority of the stones were probably brought from Harptree Ridge on\r\nMendip, distant some six miles. Weathered blocks of Triassic breccia,\r\nshowing various stages of silicification, there lie on the surface; and\r\nthere probably lay the weathered monoliths which have been transported\r\nto Stanton Drew. It is important to note that they were erected\r\nunhewn and untouched by the tool. A few stones are of other\r\nmaterial--sandstone, like the “quoit,” or oolite from Dundry.\r\n\r\nIn the great circle, of the visible stones some retain their erect\r\nposition, others are recumbent, several are partially covered by\r\naccumulation of grass-grown soil. Others are completely buried, their\r\nposition being revealed in dry seasons by the withering of the grass\r\nabove them.\r\n\r\nTo the east of this circle a short avenue leads out, there being three\r\nvisible stones and one buried block on the one hand, and two visible\r\nstones on the other. But one’s attention is apt to be diverted from\r\nthese to the very large and massive megaliths of the small N.E. circle.\r\nThis is composed of eight weathered masses, one of which (if indeed it\r\ndo not represent more than one), Prof. Lloyd Morgan tells us, is\r\nrecumbent and shattered. From this circle, all the stones of which are\r\nof the siliceous breccia, a short avenue of small stones also opens out\r\neastwards.\r\n\r\nThe third or S.W. circle lies at some little distance from the others.\r\nThe average size of the stones is smaller than in either of the other\r\ncircles, and not all are composed of the same material.\r\n\r\n“The Cove,” which has been variously regarded as a dolmen, a druidical\r\nchair of state, and a shelter for sacrificial fire, is close to the\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions and numbers of the stones are as follow:\r\n\r\n  Great circle, diameter 368 feet, 30 stones.\r\n  N.E.   „        „       97   „    8    „\r\n  S.W.   „        „      145   „   12    „\r\n\r\nAs I was not able to visit Stanton Drew when the significance of the\r\nnortherly alignments struck me, I made an appeal to Prof. Lloyd Morgan,\r\nof whose pamphlet I have so largely made use, to obtain some theodolite\r\nobservations. As a result such observations have been made by himself\r\nand Mr. Morrow, from whom I have recently received a report with full\r\npermission to make use of it in this place.\r\n\r\nThe monuments are not easy to measure, as the centres of the circles are\r\nnot readily determined, as so many of the stones are either absent,\r\nrecumbent or buried.\r\n\r\nIn my rough reading of the Ordnance map given in Fig. 47, I thought I\r\nmight be guided by taking centres, such that the avenues would be\r\naligned on them as at Stonehenge. I had not then seen the Dartmoor\r\navenues, which in some cases are not aligned on the centres. In this it\r\nis possible that I was wrong, as both Mr. Dymond’s and Mr. Morrow’s\r\nobservations suggest that the avenues are really of the Dartmoor\r\npattern. Mr. Morrow writes: “The centres of the circles are (to a\r\ncertain small extent) a matter of choice, a difference of a few minutes\r\nmay easily occur. In dealing with the avenues a larger discrepancy may\r\noccur. I have taken what, in my opinion, was the best centre line of\r\neach avenue and thus determined its azimuth. But I believe that\r\noriginally the southern line of stones forming each avenue was directed\r\ntowards the centre of the corresponding circle, and that the avenue was\r\nthen completed by the erection of a parallel line of stones. A\r\ndifference of a few degrees may thus be accounted for in the azimuth\r\nsupposed to have been originally marked out.”\r\n\r\nAbout Mr. Morrow’s azimuths there can be no question. He writes:\r\n\r\n“The instruments used were, first, a 6″ theodolite, and second, a 6″\r\ntransit theodolite. The final results were obtained with the latter. It\r\ncannot be reversed when measuring elevations. I tested it very carefully\r\nfor the adjustments of (_a_) line of collimation at right angles to the\r\nhorizontal axis, (_b_) horizontal axis perpendicular to vertical axis,\r\nand (_c_) line of collimation and spirit level parallel to each other.\r\nThe instrument was in first-rate order, the error in elevation, for\r\nexample, being within that corresponding to a slope of 1 in 40,000; that\r\nis well within the limit of 20″ to which vertical angles can be read.\r\n\r\n“The meridian was obtained by two different methods applied several\r\ntimes, the results agreeing very closely. Readings of azimuths and\r\naltitude of sun were taken between three and four hours after noon,\r\ncorrected for semi-diameter, &c., and the true bearing obtained with the\r\naid of the latitude and the declination given in Nautical Almanac\r\n(corrected for time).\r\n\r\n“With regard to the elevations of the horizon, the existence of trees on\r\nor just below the sky-line renders readings to the nearest minute\r\nuncertain. In all cases I have tried to give the most probable value,\r\nsupposing the trees to be absent. In some places the heights will have\r\naltered slightly during recent years owing to the construction of\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\n“The values given are the means of observations. They are not corrected\r\nfor height of instrument above ground, which might increase the angles\r\nby about 5 mins. Trees on the sky-line appear to make a difference of\r\nsome 35 mins.”\r\n\r\nThe azimuths as found by Mr. Morrow and myself are as under:\r\n\r\n                                                      Height of horizon\r\n                                                      (excluding trees).\r\n                                    Morrow.

The facts are:\r\n\r\n     Az.      N. Decln.     Height      Star.

It may be suggested that\r\nthe use of this avenue was to observe the May and August sunrises of the\r\nMay year. If we take the sun’s declination at 16° 20′ N., see p. 22, the\r\nazimuth should be about N. 64° E.; this is 1° from my value and 5° from\r\nthat given by Mr. Morrow, but it must not be forgotten that the choice\r\nof a day in May and August slightly differing from the normal date might\r\neasily produce such a variation.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the great circle was one of the first erected,\r\nand the fact that, like Stonehenge, it had an avenue, but that, unlike\r\nStonehenge, the avenue was directed towards the May and not the June\r\n(solstitial) sunrise further, I think, suggests that the May worship was\r\nconsidered the most important and was the first provided for.\r\n\r\nThere is reason for supposing that the great circle was at all events\r\nbuilt before the S.W. one. The great circle is situated at a lower level\r\nthan the S.W. one. The angular elevation of the hills over which\r\nArcturus rose would appear, therefore, to be higher from the great than\r\nfrom the S.W. circle. Arcturus has been reducing its declination for\r\ncenturies in consequence of the precessional movement. It would\r\ntherefore rise gradually in a greater azimuth, that is, nearer the east.\r\nAn observer in the centre of the great circle, to follow this more\r\neasterly rising over the quoit, would have to change his position\r\ngradually to the westward. But there was another way. The original\r\ndirection could be nearly maintained if the observation were made at a\r\nhigher level near the original line, as then the relative elevation of\r\nthe rising-place would be reduced.\r\n\r\nThis is what possibly was done, and this indeed may be the _vera causa_\r\nof the building of the S.W. circle.\r\n\r\nThis view of the possible function of the “quoit” is, of course,\r\nstrengthened by the fact that we find traces of high northerly alignment\r\nin other stone circles. I have already shown that there are such\r\nalignments in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe “quoit” is nearly on a level with the great circle, while the hills\r\nrise behind it. It has been suggested that it would have been more\r\nuseful on the top of the hill, but this suggestion cannot be accepted\r\nfor a moment if it were used in the way I have indicated. On a dark\r\nnight it would have been invisible, and it also would have prevented the\r\nobservation of star-rise if it were truly aligned. Being comparatively\r\nnear the circle it could easily have been illuminated at the critical\r\ntime, and thus have anticipated the bright line micrometer of more\r\nmodern times.\r\n\r\nSo far I have found no obvious use for the avenue attached to the N.E.\r\ncircle. The conditions are:\r\n\r\n              Az.            Height of                Dec.\r\n                               Hills.\r\n     Morrow.      Lockyer.    Morrow.      Morrow.

S. 79° E.   1° 40′    3° 52′ 30″ S.     5° 49′ 30″ S.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this N.E. circle, in relation to the large circle, the\r\ndata are as follows:\r\n\r\n           Az.            Height of            Dec. N.\r\n                            Hills.\r\n   Morrow.    Lockyer.     Morrow.       Morrow.       Lockyer.\r\n  N. 53° E.   N. 51° E.     1° 5′      22° 43′ 50″   23° 48′ 46″\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Morrow states, the choice of centre of the circle may alter the\r\nazimuth obtained by as much as “a few degrees,” but the value obtained\r\nfrom the Ordnance map is, definitely, N. 51° E., and with the height of\r\nhills determined by Mr. Morrow this would suggest that the N.E. circle\r\nwas really erected to provide the alignment, from the centre of the\r\ngreat circle, or from the Cove, to the summer solstitial sun, about the\r\nyear 870 B.C., Stockwell’s values for the obliquity being taken. This\r\nresult is the more striking as it gives a date for the substitution of\r\nthe June for the May worship at Stanton Drew, which is in full\r\naccordance with that obtained for the similar change at Stenness.\r\n\r\nThere is other evidence, to which I attach importance, as it deals with\r\na method and policy found in many temple fields in Egypt, that of\r\nblocking the alignment of an older star- or sun-cult, which the\r\nastronomer-priests replaced by their own. The stones of the avenue of\r\nthe solstitial N.E. circle I expect once blocked the May sunrise line\r\nfrom the great circle; judging from the Ordnance map, and remembering\r\nthe number of stones that have disappeared, this is probable if not\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nIf this were so, then the N.E. circle was the last to be erected, and\r\nthis suggestion is strengthened by Mr. Lewis’s statement that it is the\r\nmost perfect of the three.\r\n\r\nProf. Lloyd Morgan concludes his interesting account of which I have\r\nmade so much use with the following remarks:\r\n\r\n“In what order the circles were constructed we do not know. Whether the\r\nsmall N.E. circle with its more massive megaliths preceded or succeeded\r\nthe great circle with its more numerous but, on the average, less\r\nmassive stones, is a matter of mere conjecture. They may have been\r\ncontemporaneous: but it is more likely that so large a work took a long\r\ntime in execution; nor does the unity of plan of the final product\r\npreclude a gradual process of development. Finally as to the purpose of\r\nthe erection, and its hidden astronomical, mythological, or social\r\nmeaning (if it have one), we are once more at the mercy of more or less\r\nplausible conjecture. There stand the circles in a quiet Somersetshire\r\nvalley, silent memorials of a race concerning whose modes of life, of\r\nlabour, and of thought we can but speculate.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that before the monument has disappeared like so many\r\nof its fellows, some student with more knowledge and time to devote to\r\nthe inquiry than myself will endeavour to answer more of the questions\r\nraised by it.\r\n\r\n[23] With regard to these values Mr. Morrow writes: “At present\r\nHauteville’s quoit is not visible from the centre of great circle. If\r\nthe stone were erect, however, and any intervening trees and walls\r\nremoved, the top of the stone would no doubt be within view. The\r\nHauteville quoit line is thus rather a difficult one to obtain with\r\naccuracy, but the azimuth given should be correct to the nearest\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nFOLKLORE AND TRADITION\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have so far considered the circles at Stonehenge, Stenness, the\r\nHurlers and Stanton Drew, and the avenues in Brittany and on Dartmoor.\r\nBefore I refer to my later work in the south-west of England or attempt\r\nto present a summary of the results of the inquiry, I think it will be\r\nconvenient to turn for a time to another branch of it, for that there is\r\nanother closely connected series of facts to be considered in relation\r\nto the monuments folklore and tradition abundantly prove.\r\n\r\nSo far in this book I have dealt chiefly with stones--as I hold,\r\nassociated with, or themselves composing, sanctuaries. We have become\r\nacquainted with circles, menhirs, dolmens, altars, viæ sacræ, various\r\nstructures built up of stones. Barrows and earthern banks represented\r\nthem later.\r\n\r\nThe view which I have been led to bring forward so far is that these\r\nstructures had in one way or another to do with the worship of the sun\r\nand stars; that they had for the most part an astronomical use in\r\nconnection with religious ceremonials.\r\n\r\nThe next question which concerns us in an attempt to get at the bottom\r\nof the matter is to see whether there are any concomitant phenomena,\r\nand, if there be any, to classify them and study the combined results.\r\n\r\nTradition and folklore, which give dim references to the ancient uses of\r\nthe stones, show in most unmistakable fashion that the stones were not\r\nalone; associated with them almost universally were many practices\r\nreferred to on p. 26, such as the lighting of fires, passing through\r\nthem, and dancing round them; in the neighbourhood of the stones and\r\nassociated with the fire practices were also sacred trees and sacred\r\nwells or streams.\r\n\r\nFolklore and tradition not only thus may help us, but I think they will\r\nbe helped by such a general survey, brief though it must be. So far as\r\nmy reading has gone each special tradition has been considered by\r\nitself; there has been no general inquiry having for its object the\r\nstudy of the possible origin and _connection_ of many of the ancient\r\npractices and ideas which have so dimly come down to us in many cases\r\nand which we can only completely reconstruct by piecing together the\r\ninformation derived from various sources.\r\n\r\nI now propose to refer to all these matters with the view of seeing\r\nwhether there be any relation between practices apparently disconnected\r\nin so many cases if we follow the literature in which they are\r\nchronicled. We must not blame the literature, since the facts which\r\nremain to be recorded now here, now there, are but a small fraction of\r\nthose that have been forgotten. Fortunately, the practices forgotten in\r\none locality have been remembered in another, so that it is possible the\r\npicture can be restored more completely than one might have thought at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that from the point of view with which we are\r\nat present concerned, one of the chief relations we must look for is\r\nthat of time, seeing that my chief affirmation with regard to the stone\r\nmonuments is that they were used for ceremonial purposes at certain\r\nseasons, those seasons being based first upon the agricultural, and\r\nlater upon the astronomical divisions of the year, to which I drew\r\nattention in Chapter III. In Chapter IV., when referring to the\r\nagricultural and astronomical new years’ days, I indicated a possible\r\nrelation between the temple worship and the floral celebrations of that\r\ntime, and later on (p. 40), in connection with the monuments in\r\nBrittany, I pointed out the coincidence of fire customs at the same time\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\nBut in a matter of this kind it will not do to depend upon isolated\r\ncases; the general trend of all the facts available along several lines\r\nof inquiry must be found and studied, first separately and then _inter\r\nse_, if any final conclusion is to be reached.\r\n\r\nThis is what I now propose to do in a very summary manner. It is not my\r\ntask to arrange the facts of folklore and tradition, but simply to cull\r\nfrom the available sources precise statements which bear upon the\r\nquestions before us. These statements, I think, may be accepted as\r\ntrustworthy, and all the more so as many of the various recorders have\r\nhad no idea either of the existence of a May year at all or of the\r\nconnection between the different classes of the phenomena which ought to\r\nexist if my theory of their common origin in connection with ancient\r\nworship and the monuments is anywhere near the truth.\r\n\r\nThis question of time relations is surrounded by difficulties.\r\n\r\nI gave in Fig. 7 the Gregorian dates of the beginning of the quarters\r\nof the May year, if nothing but the sun’s declination of 16° 20′ N. or\r\nS., four times in its yearly path, be considered. These were:--\r\n\r\n                           May      Greek       Roman\r\n                          Year.   Calendar.

Efforts were made to\r\nchange the date and so obliterate gradually the old traditions; another\r\nway, and this turned out to be the more efficacious, was to change the\r\nvenue of the festival, so to speak, in favour of some Christian\r\ncelebration or saint’s day. The old festivals took no account of\r\nweek-days, so it was ruled that the festivals were to take place on the\r\nfirst day of the week; later on some of them were ruled to begin on the\r\nfirst day of the month.\r\n\r\nWhen Easter became a movable feast, the efforts of the priests were\r\ngreatly facilitated, and indeed it would seem as if this result of such\r\na change was not absent from the minds of those who favoured it.\r\n\r\nThe change of style was, as I have before stated, a fruitful source of\r\nconfusion, and this was still further complicated by another difficulty.\r\nPiers[25] tells us that consequent upon the change “the Roman Catholics\r\nlight their fires by the new style, as the correction originated from a\r\npope; and for that very same reason the Protestants adhere to the old.”\r\n\r\nI will refer to each of the festivals and their changes of date.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February 4._\r\n\r\nBefore the movable Easter the February festival had been transformed\r\ninto Ash Wednesday (February 4). The eve of the festival was Shrove\r\nTuesday, and it is quite possible that the ashes used by the priests on\r\nWednesday were connected with the bonfires of the previous night.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that initially the festival, with its accompanying\r\nbonfire, was transferred to the first Sunday in Lent, February 8.\r\n\r\nI quote the following from Hazlitt[26]:--\r\n\r\n“Durandus, in his ‘Rationale,’ tells us, Lent was counted to begin on\r\nthat which is now the first Sunday in Lent, and to end on Easter Eve;\r\nwhich time, saith he, containing forty-two days, if you take out of them\r\nthe six Sundays (on which it was counted not lawful at any time of the\r\nyear to fast), then there will remain only thirty-six days: and,\r\ntherefore, that the number of days which Christ fasted might be\r\nperfected, Pope Gregory added to Lent four days of the week\r\nbefore-going, viz., that which we now call Ash Wednesday, and the three\r\ndays following it. So that we see the first observation of Lent began\r\nfrom a superstitious, unwarrantable, and indeed profane, conceit of\r\nimitating Our Saviour’s miraculous abstinence. Lent is so called from\r\nthe time of the year wherein it is observed: Lent in the Saxon language\r\nsignifying Spring.”\r\n\r\nWhether this be the origin of the lenten fast or not it is certain that\r\nthe connection thus established between an old pagan feast and a new\r\nChristian one is very ingenious: 24 days in February plus 22 days in\r\nMarch (March 22 being originally the fixed date for Easter) gives us 46\r\ndays (6 × 7) + 4, and from the point of view of priestcraft the result\r\nwas eminently satisfactory, for thousands of people still light fires\r\non Shrove Tuesday or on the first Sunday of Lent, whether those days\r\noccur in February or March. They are under the impression that they are\r\ndoing homage to a church festival, and the pagan origin is entirely\r\nforgotten not only by them but even by those who chronicle the practices\r\nas “Lent customs.”[27]\r\n\r\nFinally, after the introduction of the movable Easter, the priests at\r\nRome, instead of using the “pagan” ashes produced on the eve of the\r\nfirst Sunday in Lent or Ash Wednesday in each year, utilised those\r\nderived from the burning of the palms used on Palm Sunday of the year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nFurther steps were taken to conceal from future generations the origin\r\nof the “pagan” custom due on February 4. February 3 was dedicated to St.\r\n“Blaze.” How well this answered is shown by the following quotation from\r\nPercy.[28] “The anniversary of St. Blazeus is the 3rd February, when it\r\nis still the custom in many parts of England to light up fires on the\r\nhills on St. Blayse night: _a custom antiently taken up perhaps for no\r\nbetter reason than the jingling resemblance of his name to the word\r\nBlaze_.”\r\n\r\nThis even did not suffice. A great candle church festival was\r\nestablished on February 2. This was called “Candlemas,” and Candlemas is\r\nstill the common name of the beginning of the Scotch legal year. In the\r\nCathedral of Durham when Cosens was bishop he “busied himself from two\r\nof the clocke in the afternoone till foure, in climbing long ladders to\r\nstick up wax candles in the said Cathedral Church; the number of all the\r\ncandles burnt that evening was 220, besides 16 torches; 60 of those\r\nburning tapers and torches standing upon and near the high altar.”[29]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the pagan fires at other times of the year were\r\nalso gradually replaced by candles in the churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May 6._\r\n\r\nThe May festival has been treated by the Church in the same way as the\r\nFebruary one. With a fixed Easter Sunday on March 22, 46 days after\r\nbrought us to a Thursday (May 7), hence Holy Thursday[30] and Ascension\r\nDay. With Easter movable there of course was more confusion. Whit\r\nSunday, the Feast of Pentecost, was only nine days after Holy Thursday,\r\nand it occurred, in some years, on the same day of the month as\r\nAscension Day in others. In Scotland the festival now is ascribed to\r\nWhit Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt is possibly in consequence of this that the festival before even the\r\nchange of style was held on the 1st of the month.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall, where the celebrations still survive, the day chosen is May\r\n8.\r\n\r\n\r\n_August 8._\r\n\r\nFor the migrations of the dates of the “pagan” festival in the beginning\r\nof August from the 1st to the 12th, migrations complicated by the old\r\nand new style, I refer to Prof. Rhys’ Hibbert Lectures, p. 418, in\r\nwhich work a full account of the former practices in Ireland and Wales\r\nis given. The old festival in Ireland was associated with Lug, a form of\r\nthe Sun-God; the most celebrated one was held at Tailetin. This\r\nfeast--Lugnassad--was changed into the church celebration Lammas, from\r\nA.S. hl’áfmaesse--that is loaf-mass or bread-mass, so named as a mass or\r\nfeast of thanksgiving for the first fruits of the corn harvest. The old\r\ncustoms in Wales and the Isle of Alan included the ascent of hills in\r\nthe early morning, but so far I have found no record of fires in\r\nconnection with this date.[31]\r\n\r\n\r\n_November 8._\r\n\r\nThe facts that November 11 is quarter day in Scotland, that mayors are\r\nelected on or about that date, show, I think, pretty clearly that we are\r\nhere dealing with the old “pagan” date.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Church anticipated it by the feast of All Souls’ on\r\nNovember 1 reminds us of what happened in the case of the February\r\ncelebration; later I give a reference to the change of date; and perhaps\r\nthis date was also determined by the natural gravitation to the first of\r\nthe month, as in the case of May, and because it marked at one time the\r\nbeginning of the Celtic year.\r\n\r\nBut what seems quite certain is that the feast which should have been\r\nheld on November 8 on astronomical grounds was first converted by the\r\nChurch into the feast of St. Martin on November 11. The _Encyclopædia\r\nBritannica_ tells us: “The feast of St. Martin (Martinmas) took the\r\nplace of an old pagan festival, and inherited some of its usages, such\r\nas the Martinsmännchen, Martinsfeuer, Martinshorn, and the like, in\r\nvarious parts of Germany.”\r\n\r\nSt. Martin lived about A.D. 300. As the number of saints increased, it\r\nbecame impossible to dedicate a feast-day to each. Hence it was found\r\nexpedient to have an annual aggregate commemoration of such as had not\r\nspecial days for themselves. So a church festival “All Hallows,” or\r\n“Hallowmass,” was instituted about A.D. 610 in memory of the martyrs,\r\nand it was to take place on May 1. For some reason or another this was\r\nchanged in A.D. 834; May was given up, and the date fixed as November 1.\r\nThis was a commemoration of all the saints, so we get the new name “All\r\nSaints’ Day.”\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the intention of the Church was to\r\nanticipate, and therefore gradually to obliterate the pagan festival\r\nstill held at Martinmas, and it has been successful in many places. In\r\nIreland, for instance; at Samhain,[32] November 1, “the proper time for\r\nprophecy and the unveiling of mysteries.”... It was then that fire was\r\nlighted at a place called after Mog Ruith’s daughter Tlachtga. From\r\nTlachtga all the hearths in Ireland are said to have been annually\r\nsupplied, just as the Lemnians had once a year to put their fires out\r\nand light them anew from that brought in the sacred ship from Delos. The\r\nhabit of celebrating _Nos Galan-galaf_ in Wales by lighting bonfires on\r\nthe hills is possibly not yet extinct.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we find the pagan fires transferred from the 8th to the 1st\r\nof November in Ireland, but in the Isle of Man this is not so. I will\r\nanticipate another reference to Rhys by stating that Martinmas had\r\nprogressed from the 11th to the 24th before the change of style brought\r\nit back, “old Martinmas,” November 24, being one of the best recognised\r\n“old English holidays,” “old Candlemas” being another, at the other end\r\nof the May year; this last had slipped from February 2 to February 15\r\nbefore it was put back again.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Isle of Man Rhys writes[33] that the feast is there\r\ncalled Hollantide, and is kept on November 12, a reckoning which he\r\nstates “is according to the old style.” The question is, are we not\r\ndealing here with the Martinmas festival _not_ antedated to November 1?\r\nHe adds, “that is the day when the tenure of land terminates, and when\r\nserving men go to their places. In other words it is the beginning of a\r\nnew year.” This is exactly what happens in Scotland, and the day is\r\nstill called Martinmas.\r\n\r\nThere is a custom in mid-England which strikingly reminds us of the\r\nimportance of Martinmas in relation to old tenures, if even the custom\r\ndoes not carry us still further back. This is the curious and\r\ninteresting ceremony of collecting the wroth silver, due and payable to\r\nhis Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensbury on “Martinmas Eve.”\r\nThe payment is made on an ancient mound on the summit of Knightlow\r\nHill, about five miles out of Coventry, and in the parish of\r\nRyton-on-Dunsmore. One feature about this singular ceremonial is that it\r\nmust take place before sun-rising.\r\n\r\n[24] Hazlitt, _Dictionary of Faiths and Folklore_, under Gule of August.\r\n\r\n[25] _Survey of the South of Ireland_, p. 232.\r\n\r\n[26] Under Ash Wednesday.\r\n\r\n[27] Frazer, _Golden Bough_, iii., 238 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[28] _Notes to Northumberland Household Book_, 1770, p. 333.\r\n\r\n[29] Quoted by Hazlitt.\r\n\r\n[30] Much confusion has arisen with regard to the Holy Thursday in\r\nRogation week because there is another Holy or Maundy Thursday in Easter\r\nweek. Archæologists have also been often misled by the practice of many\r\nwriters of describing the May festivals as midsummer festivals. The\r\nfirst of May, of course, marked the beginning of summer.\r\n\r\n[31] Mr. Frazer informs me that the 13th August was Diana’s day at Nemi\r\nand there was a fire festival.\r\n\r\n[32] _Rhys’ Hibbert Lectures_, p. 514.\r\n\r\n[33] _Celtic Folklore_, p. 315.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSACRED FIRES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnificent collection of facts bearing on this subject which has\r\nbeen brought together by Mr. Frazer in _The Golden Bough_ renders it\r\nunnecessary for me to deal with the details of this part of my subject\r\nat any great length.\r\n\r\nWe have these records of fires:--\r\n\r\n(1) In February, May, August and November of the original May year.\r\n\r\n(2) In June and December on the longest and shortest days of the\r\nsolstitial year, concerning which there could not be, and has not been,\r\nany such change of date as has occurred in relation to the May year\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\n(3) A fire at Easter, in all probability added not long before or at the\r\nintroduction of Christianity. I find no traces of a fire festival at the\r\ncorresponding equinox in September.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Cormac that the fires were generally double and that\r\ncattle were driven between them.\r\n\r\nConcerning this question of fire, both Mr. Frazer and the Rev. S.\r\nBaring-Gould[34] suggest that we are justified in considering the\r\nChristian treatment of the sacred fire as a survival of pagan times. Mr.\r\nBaring-Gould writes as follows:--“When Christianity became dominant, it\r\nwas necessary to dissociate the ideas of the people from the central\r\nfire as mixed up with the old gods; at the same time the central fire\r\nwas an absolute need. Accordingly the Church was converted into the\r\nsacred depository of the perpetual fire.”\r\n\r\nHe further points out that there still remain in some of our churches\r\n(in Cornwall, York, and Dorset) the contrivances--now called\r\ncresset-stones--used. They are blocks of stone with cups hollowed out.\r\nSome are placed in lamp-niches furnished with flues. On these he remarks\r\n(p. 122):--\r\n\r\n“Now although these lamps and cressets had their religious\r\nsignification, yet this religious signification was an afterthought. The\r\norigin of them lay in the necessity of there being in every place a\r\ncentral light, from which light could at any time be borrowed; and the\r\nreason why this central light was put in the church was to dissociate it\r\nfrom the heathen ideas attached formerly to it. As it was, the good\r\npeople of the Middle Ages were not quite satisfied with the central\r\nchurch fire, and they had recourse in times of emergency to other, and\r\nas the Church deemed them unholy, fires. When a plague and murrain\r\nappeared among cattle, then they lighted need-fires from two pieces of\r\ndry wood, and drove the cattle between the flames, believing that this\r\nnew flame was wholesome to the purging away of the disease. For kindling\r\nthe need-fires the employment of flint and steel was forbidden. The fire\r\nwas only efficacious when extracted in prehistoric fashion, out of\r\nwood. The lighting of these need-fires was forbidden by the Church in\r\nthe eighth century. What shows that this need-fire was distinctly\r\nheathen is that in the Church new fire was obtained at Easter annually\r\nby striking flint and steel together. It was supposed that the old fire\r\nin a twelvemonth had got exhausted, or perhaps that all light expired\r\nwith Christ, and that new fire must be obtained. Accordingly the priest\r\nsolemnly struck new fire out of flint and steel. But fire from flint and\r\nsteel was a novelty; and the people, Pagan at heart, had no confidence\r\nin it, and in time of adversity went back to the need-fire kindled in\r\nthe time-honoured way from wood by friction, before this new-fangled way\r\nof drawing it out of stone and iron was invented.”\r\n\r\nThe same authority informs us that before Christianity was introduced\r\ninto Ireland by St. Patrick there was a temple at Tara “where fire\r\nburned ever, and was on no account suffered to go out.”\r\n\r\nMr. Frazer,[35] quoting Cerbied, shows that in the ancient religion of\r\nArmenia the new fire was kindled at the February festival of the May\r\nyear, in honour of the fire-god Mihr. “A bonfire was made in a public\r\nplace, and lamps kindled at it were kept burning throughout the year in\r\neach of the fire-god’s temples.” This festival now takes place at\r\nCandlemas, February 2.\r\n\r\nWe must assume, then, that the pagan fires were produced by the friction\r\nof dry wood, and possibly in connection with an ever-burning fire. In\r\neither case the priests officiating at the various circles must have had\r\na place handy where the wood was kept dry or the fire kept burning, and\r\non this ground alone we may again inquire whether such structures as\r\nMaeshowe at the Stenness circle, the Fougou at that of the Merry\r\nMaidens, and indeed chambered barrows and cairns generally, were not\r\nused for these purposes amongst others; whether indeed they were not\r\nprimarily built for the living and not for the dead, and whether this\r\nwill explain the finding of traces of fires and of hollowed stones in\r\nthem, as well as some points in their structure. Mr. MacRitchie[36] has\r\nbrought together several of these points, among them fireplaces and\r\nflues for carrying away smoke.\r\n\r\nAt both solstices it would appear that a special fire-rite was\r\npractised. This consisted of tying straw on a wheel and rolling it when\r\nlighted down a hill. There is much evidence for the wheel at the summer,\r\nbut less at the winter, solstice; still, we learn from the old Runic\r\n_fasti_ that a wheel was used to denote the festival of Christmas. With\r\nregard to the summer solstice I quote the following from Hazlitt (under\r\nJohn, St.):--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--The Carro, Florence. From Baring-Gould’s\r\n_Strange Survivals_.]\r\n\r\n“Durandus, speaking of the rites of the Feast of St. John Baptist,\r\ninforms us of this curious circumstance, that in some places they roll a\r\nwheel about to signify that the sun, then occupying the highest place in\r\nthe Zodiac, is beginning to descend. ‘Rotam quoque hoc die in quibusdam\r\nlocis volvunt, ad significandum quod Sol altissimum tunc locum in Cœlo\r\noccupet, et descendere incipiat in Zodiaco.’ Harl. MSS. 2345 (on\r\nvellum), Art. 100, is an account of the rites of St. John Baptist’s Eve,\r\nin which the wheel is also mentioned. In the amplified account of these\r\nceremonies given by Naogeorgus, we read that this wheel was taken up to\r\nthe top of a mountain and rolled down thence; and that, as it had\r\npreviously been covered with straw, twisted about it and set on fire, it\r\nappeared at a distance as if the sun had been falling from the sky. And\r\nhe further observes, that the people imagine that all their ill-luck\r\nrolls away from them together with this wheel. At Norwich, says a writer\r\nin _Current Notes_ for March, 1854, the rites of St. John the Baptist\r\nwere anciently observed, ‘when it was the custom to turn or roll a wheel\r\nabout, in signification of the sun’s annual course, or the sun, then\r\noccupying the highest place in the Zodiac, was about descending.’”\r\n\r\nAt Magdalen College, Oxford, the May and June years are clearly\r\ndifferentiated. There is a vocal service at sunrise on May morning,\r\nfollowed by boys blowing horns. At the summer solstice there is a sermon\r\npreached during the day in the quadrangle.\r\n\r\nOne of the most picturesque survivals of this ancient custom takes place\r\nat Florence each year at Easter. This is fully described by\r\nBaring-Gould. The moment the sacred fire is produced at the high altar a\r\ndove (in plaster) carries it along a rope about 200 yards long to a car\r\nin the square outside the west door of the cathedral and sets fire to a\r\nfuse, thus causing the explosion of fireworks.\r\n\r\nThe car with its explosives is the survival of the ancient bonfire.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the lighting of these fires on a large scale\r\nlingered longest in Ireland and Brittany.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ (February, 1795) thus\r\ndescribes the Irish Beltane fires in 1782, “the most singular sight in\r\nIreland”:--\r\n\r\n“Exactly at midnight, the fires began to appear, and taking the\r\nadvantage of going up to the leads of the house, which had a widely\r\nextended view, I saw on a radius of thirty miles, all around, the fires\r\nburning on every eminence which the country afforded. I had a farther\r\nsatisfaction in learning, from undoubted authority, that the people\r\ndanced round the fires, and at the close went through these fires, and\r\nmade their sons and daughters, together with their cattle, pass through\r\nthe fire; and the whole was conducted with religious solemnity.”\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed with reference to these fire festivals that\r\nalthough there were undoubtedly four, in May, August, November and\r\nFebruary, those in May and November were more important than the others.\r\nThis no doubt arose from the fact that at different times the May and\r\nNovember celebrations were _New Year_ festivals. With regard to the New\r\nYear in November in Celtic and later times. Rhys writes as follows\r\n(_Hibbert Lectures_, p. 514):--\r\n\r\n“The Celts were in the habit formerly of counting winters, and of\r\ngiving precedence in their reckoning to night and winter over day and\r\nsummer (p. 360); I should argue that the last day of the year in the\r\nIrish story of Diarmait’s death meant the eve of November or\r\nAll-halloween, the night before the Irish _Samhain_, and known in Welsh\r\nas _Nos Galan-gaeaf_, or the Night of the Winter Calends. But there is\r\nno occasion to rest on this alone, as we have the evidence of Cormac’s\r\nGlossary that the month before the beginning of winter was the last\r\nmonth; so that the first day of the first month of winter was also the\r\nfirst day of the year.”\r\n\r\nThat the November bonfire was recognised as heralding the dominion of\r\nthe gods and spirits of darkness,[37] that the old ideas surrounding\r\nHorus and Set in Egypt were not forgotten, is evidenced by the fact that\r\nwhen it was extinct the whole company round it would suddenly take to\r\ntheir heels, shouting at the top of their voices:--\r\n\r\n  Yr hwch đu gwta  | The cropped black sow\r\n  A gipio ’r ola’! | Seize the hindmost!\r\n\r\nA piecing together of the folklore and traditions of different districts\r\nsuggests that sacrifices were made in connection with the fire\r\nfestivals, in fact that the fire at one of the critical times of the May\r\nyear at least was a sacrificial one.\r\n\r\nI will quote two cases given by Gomme[38] for May Day and All Souls’ Day\r\nrespectively:--\r\n\r\n“At the village of Holne, situated on one of the spurs of Dartmoor, is a\r\nfield of about two acres, the property of the parish, and called the\r\nPloy Field. In the centre of this field stands a granite pillar (Menhir)\r\nsix or seven feet high. On May-morning, before daybreak, the young men\r\nof the village used to assemble there, and then proceed to the moor,\r\nwhere they selected a ram lamb, and after running it down, brought it in\r\ntriumph to the Ploy Field, fastened it to the pillar, cut its throat and\r\nthen roasted it whole, skin, wool, &c. At midday a struggle took place,\r\nat the risk of cut hands, for a slice, it being supposed to confer luck\r\nfor the ensuing year on the fortunate devourer. As an act of gallantry\r\nthe young men sometimes fought their way through the crowd to get a\r\nslice for the chosen amongst the young women, all of whom, in their best\r\ndresses, attended the Ram Feast, as it was called. Dancing, wrestling,\r\nand other games, assisted by copious libations of cider during the\r\nafternoon, prolonged the festivity till midnight.”\r\n\r\nIn the parish of King’s Teignton, Devonshire, “a lamb is drawn about the\r\nparish on Whitsun Monday in a cart covered with garlands of lilac,\r\nlaburnum and other flowers, when persons are requested to give something\r\ntowards the animal and attendant expenses; on Tuesday it is then killed\r\nand roasted whole in the middle of the village. The lamb is then sold in\r\nslices to the poor at a cheap rate.”\r\n\r\nThe popular legend concerning the origin of this custom introduces two\r\nimportant elements--a reference to “heathen days” and the title of\r\n“sacrifice” ascribed to the killing of the lamb (p. 31).\r\n\r\n“At St. Peter’s, Athlone, every family of a village on St. Martin’s Day\r\nkills an animal of some kind or other; those who are rich kill a cow or\r\nsheep, others a goose or turkey, while those who are poor kill a hen or\r\ncock; with the blood of the animal they sprinkle the threshold and also\r\nthe four corners of the house, and ‘this performance is done to exclude\r\nevery kind of evil spirit from the dwelling where the sacrifice is made\r\ntill the return of the same day the following year’” (p. 163).\r\n\r\nOther traditions indicate that human sacrifices were in question, and\r\nthat lots were drawn, or some other method of the choice of a victim was\r\nadopted. I quote from Hazlitt (i., 44) the following report of the\r\nMinister of Callender in 1794:--\r\n\r\n“The people of this district have two customs, which are fast wearing\r\nout, not only here, but all over the Highlands, and therefore ought to\r\nbe taken notice of, while they remain. Upon the first day of May, which\r\nis called Beltan, or Bàl-tein-day, all the boys in a township or hamlet\r\nmeet in the moors. They cut a table in the green sod, of a round figure,\r\nby casting a trench in the ground of such a circumference as to hold the\r\nwhole company. They kindle a fire, and dress a repast of eggs and milk\r\nin the consistence of a custard. They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is\r\ntoasted at the embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten up,\r\nthey divide the cake into so many portions, as similar as possible to\r\none another in size and shape, as there are persons in the company. They\r\ndaub one of these portions all over with charcoal, until it be perfectly\r\nblack. They put all the bits of the cake into a bonnet. Everyone,\r\nblindfold, draws out a portion. He who holds the bonnet is entitled to\r\nthe last bit. Whoever draws the black bit is the devoted person, who is\r\nto be sacrificed to Baal, whose favour they mean to implore in rendering\r\nthe year productive of the sustenance of man and beast. There is little\r\ndoubt of these inhuman sacrifices having been once offered in this\r\ncountry as well as in the East, although they now pass from the act of\r\nsacrificing, and only compel the devoted person to leap three times\r\nthrough the flames; with which the ceremonies of the festival are\r\nclosed.”\r\n\r\nI may conclude this chapter by referring to similar practices in\r\nBrittany, where Baring-Gould[39] has so successfully studied them.\r\n\r\nThe present remnants of the old cult in the different parishes are now\r\ncalled “pardons”;[40] they are still numerous. I give those for the May\r\nand August festivals (p. 83).\r\n\r\n                              _May._\r\n\r\n  Ascension Day.

The fire has\r\nto be lighted only by a pure virgin, and the sick and feeble are carried\r\nto the spot, as the bonfire flames are held to be gifted with miraculous\r\nhealing powers.\r\n\r\nWhen the flames are abated, stones are placed for the souls of the dead\r\nto sit there through the remainder of the night and enjoy the heat.\r\n“Every member of the community carries away a handful of ashes as a\r\nsovereign cure for sundry maladies. The whole proceeding is instinct\r\nwith paganism” (p. 75). With regard to the accompanying sacrifices we\r\nread: “In ancient times sacrifices were made of cocks and oxen at\r\ncertain shrines--now they are still presented, but it is to the chapels\r\nof saints. S. Herbot receives cow’s tails, and these may be seen heaped\r\nupon his altar in Loqeffret. At Coadret as many as seven hundred are\r\noffered on the day of the “pardon.” At S. Nicolas-des-Eaux, it is S.\r\nNicodemus who in his chapel receives gifts of whole oxen, and much the\r\nsame takes place at Carnac.”\r\n\r\n[34] _Strange Survivals_, p. 120 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[35] _Golden Bough_, iii. 248.\r\n\r\n[36] _The Testimony of Tradition._\r\n\r\n[37] _Hibbert Lectures_, p. 516; _Dawn of Astronomy_, p. 215.\r\n\r\n[38] _Ethnology in Folklore_, pp. 32 and 163.\r\n\r\n[39] _A Book of Brittany._\r\n\r\n[40] These “pardons” run strangely parallel with the “Feast Days” in E.\r\nand W. Penrith, in Cornwall, where of 26 feasts, 13 occur around the\r\nchief days of the May year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nSACRED TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of tree-worship is a vast one, as anyone may gather who will\r\nread the _Golden Bough_. Fortunately for my readers it is not necessary\r\nto discuss the whole or even any great part of it in connection with the\r\ninquiry which now concerns us. I may say that only rarely is the old\r\ntree-worship considered with its concomitant of temple-worship, so that\r\nI now have to bring together information widely separated because the\r\nconnection which I have to show was intimate has not been enlarged upon;\r\nindeed, in many cases it has not been suspected.\r\n\r\nThere is another limitation of the inquiry. We have only to deal chiefly\r\nwith those plants and trees recorded as worshipped at the chief festival\r\ntimes of the year, which have already been marked out for us by the fire\r\nceremonials. These fires were like the chronofer installed in modern\r\ndays at the General Post Office, their practical function being to give\r\nthe time; they announced the beginning of a new season.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV. I referred to the association of Mistletoe with the\r\nSolstitial worship. When we deal with the May year we meet constantly\r\nwith references to the Rowan and the Hawthorn in the folklore connected\r\nwith it. We seem in presence, then, not only of tree cult generally, but\r\nof sacred trees special to each of the two worships we have been\r\nconsidering. I propose now, therefore, to bring together some of the\r\ninformation to be gathered from a very cursory reference to the vast\r\nliterature which exists on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance I begged my friend, Professor Bayley Balfour,\r\nKeeper of the King’s Garden at Edinburgh, to give me some particulars of\r\nthe Rowan Tree, which I imagined (1) to have been chosen on account of\r\nits flowers being prominent about May Day (Beltane) and its berries in\r\nearly November (Hallowe’en), and (2) to have a different habitat from\r\nthe Mistletoe. I have to thank my friend for much valuable information.\r\n\r\nThe Rowan Tree, called also the Mountain Ash (_Pyrus Aucuparia_), seems\r\nto grow pretty freely all over the _Northern_ parts of Europe. Professor\r\nBalfour tells me: “Rowan is essentially a Northern plant--an immigrant\r\nto Europe from N.W. Asia--and now is spread all over North and Central\r\nEurope in abundance, with only some ‘feelers’ passing south into the\r\nMediterranean Basin. It does not go south of Cappadocia in Asia Minor.\r\nIt does not reach Greece. In Italy it occurs on the Eastern Apennines,\r\nand also in N.E. Sicily. In Spain it runs over the higher regions in the\r\nN. and into the centre, passing just into Portugal. Its occurrence in\r\nMadeira is not certainly established as a natural phenomenon; perhaps it\r\nis only introduced there. In all these Southern outruns the tree cannot\r\nbe said to have any dominance, and its area and abundance are infinitely\r\nless than in the North. Scandinavia is one of its best homes. Everywhere\r\nit is found right north to 71°, there becoming a bush only, but yet\r\nripening seed. It reaches Iceland, where trees of some size occur. All\r\nover Great Britain and Ireland it is generally spread. You may certainly\r\nsay there is much in Norway, and there is equally certainly less, even\r\nlittle, in Italy.”\r\n\r\nIn Pratt’s _Flowering Plants of Great Britain_ (vol. 2, p. 260) it is\r\nstated, “The flowers, which grow in dense clusters, and are\r\ngreenish-white, appear in May.... In autumn, however, the tree is more\r\nbeautiful than in summer, for at that season the rich cluster of red\r\nfruits gleams among the foliage, each berry having the form of a tiny\r\napple, and containing a little core and seeds within.”\r\n\r\nAt Christiania the mean of ten years’ flowering is given by Professor\r\nSchübeler[41] as--first flowers, June 19; general flowering, June 30.\r\nThis, then, is later than in Britain. On high grounds the fruit is\r\nconspicuous here on November 1; on lower levels the birds attack it and\r\nreduce its striking appearance before that date.\r\n\r\nAssociated with the Rowan in the folklore connected with temple worship\r\nis the Hawthorn, Whitethorn or “May” (_Crategus oxyocantha_), which also\r\nflowers at the beginning of May, while its berries or “haws,” like those\r\nof the Rowan, are conspicuous in November. We see, then, that there is a\r\nmost obvious reason in this for the association of the two trees.\r\nAccording to Rhys,[42] the English name appears to be of Scandinavian\r\norigin, the Old Norse being _reynir_, Danish _rönne_, Swedish _rönn_;\r\nand the old Norsemen treated the tree as holy and sacred to Thor.\r\n\r\nThese two trees interest us from three points of view. We find them\r\nconnected with:--\r\n\r\n  1. May and November celebrations.\r\n\r\n  2. Superstitions concerning witchcraft, &c.\r\n\r\n  3. Holy wells.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I shall deal with the two former.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _The May Celebrations._\r\n\r\nSeeing that the year beginning in May was established because that month\r\nreally opened the vegetation year, it is little to be wondered at that\r\namong the chief features of New Year’s Day was what we may term a flower\r\nworship; it is probable that we are here dealing with the sacred-tree\r\nside of the general festival at all the monuments erected in connection\r\nwith the May year worship. The old traditions have lingered longest\r\naround the things we have still with us, the trees and flowers; and it\r\nis in connection with this side of the worship that most information is\r\navailable. From the facts I have already stated, for Britain the Rowan\r\nand Hawthorn were most naturally selected as the typical forms.[43]\r\n\r\nMany poets have written of this festival[44]: Chaucer, Shakspere,\r\nMilton, Bourne, Herrick and others. Chaucer writes:\r\n\r\n  “Fourth goeth al the Court both most and lest,\r\n   To fetch the flouris fresh and branche and blome,”\r\n\r\nwhen not the courtiers only, but lowliest of men and maidens sallied\r\nforth\r\n\r\n  “To do observaunce to a morn of May.”\r\n\r\nThere is a vast literature connected with May Day celebrations, among it\r\nreferences to Celtic customs, and I may add that, besides May Day,\r\nAugust, November and February had their flower festivals also. I shall,\r\nhowever, deal chiefly with May in this book to keep it within bounds.\r\n\r\nMay Day in Manx was termed _Shenn Laa Boaldyn_; it is the _belltaine_ of\r\nCormac’s _Glossary_, the Scotch Gaelic equivalent of which is\r\n_bealtuinn_.\r\n\r\nThe traditions and customs connected with May Day in Great Britain have\r\nsurvived longest in the West of England; even now, as will be seen by\r\nthe account of recent celebrations at Helston in Cornwall, given below,\r\nthey are still continued.\r\n\r\nAltogether the customs, ancient and modern, of which the flower worship\r\nformed a part, may be summed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Lighting of bonfires,[45] and, in the evening, houses illuminated\r\n  with candles, torches carried about, and fireballs played with.\r\n\r\n  2. Man and beast passed through the fire or between two fires.\r\n\r\n  3. Going out at daybreak to gather Whitethorn or May (Sycamore in\r\n  Cornwall), and making whistles of the branches for the May-music and\r\n  merry-making. Blowing of tin horns at daybreak by boys, and from money\r\n  received getting breakfast at a farmhouse.\r\n\r\n  4. Flower-bedecked girls dance round a Maypole, and one chosen as\r\n  “Queen of the May.”\r\n\r\n  5. In Cornwall the custom prevailed till lately of going out with\r\n  buckets or any available vessels full of water and thoroughly wetting\r\n  anyone who was not wearing a piece of May.\r\n\r\n  6. The “Furry Dance” (in Cornwall), which consists in dancing through\r\n  the town and also through as many houses as desired. If resistance is\r\n  offered it is permitted to break open the door, and no penalty can be\r\n  imposed.\r\n\r\n  7. Sacrifices made (Isle of Man) at a very ancient date, and probably\r\n  human ones still earlier (Scotland).\r\n\r\n  8. Special worship at holy wells.\r\n\r\nFlowers are public property on Flora Day, and this custom of dancing\r\nthrough the _houses_ is supposed to have originated probably for the\r\npurpose of picking the flowers in the gardens behind.\r\n\r\nThe following is a short abstract of a very interesting account given in\r\n_The Western Weekly News_, May 13th, 1905, of the “Flora Day” at\r\nHelston, Cornwall, which took place this year. It gives us an idea of\r\nformer festivals which are so quickly dying out:--\r\n\r\nThe Furry Dance is always the feature of the day. The first part took\r\nplace at seven o’clock in the morning, at which hour two couples started\r\nout and danced through the streets and through some houses of residents.\r\nThe great dance was at noon, and those taking part in it assembled in\r\nthe Corn Exchange.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready the whole company, headed by a band playing the old\r\nFurry Dance, started out and danced through the town and through many\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was given over to a Horse Show and to much\r\nmerry-making. Excursions had been run from all parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Rowan Tree and Witchcraft._\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that in the constant association of the Rowan with\r\nthe May worship and the holy wells which were adjacent to the stone\r\ncircles where the worship was conducted, we find the reason of the\r\nselection of the wood of the Rowan Tree as an antidote to all the ills\r\nwhich witchcraft was supposed to bring about. Rhys tells us that “The\r\ntree has also the old names of Quicken-tree, Roddon, and Witchen-tree.”\r\n\r\nTo quote again from Pratt (_op. cit._ vol. 2, p. 261): “The old notion\r\nthat the Mountain Ash, or Rowan Tree, as it is called in the North, was\r\nefficacious against witchcraft and the evil eye, still prevails in the\r\nNorth of England and the Scottish Highlands. Pennant remarks, in his\r\n_Tour of Scotland_, that the farmers carefully preserve their cattle\r\nagainst witchcraft by placing branches of Honeysuckle and Mountain Ash\r\nin their cowhouses on the 2nd of May. The milkmaid in Westmorland may\r\noften be seen, even now, with a branch of this tree either in her hand\r\nor tied to her milking-pail, from a similar superstition; and in earlier\r\ndays crosses cut out of its wood were worn about the person. In an old\r\nsong called “Laidley Wood,” in the _Northumberland Garland_, we find a\r\nreference to this:\r\n\r\n  “The spells were vain, the hag return’d\r\n   To the Queen in sorrowful mood,\r\n   Crying, that witches have no power\r\n   Where there is Rown-tree wood.”\r\n\r\nRhys, referring to May Day customs in the Isle of Man, writes[46]: “This\r\nwas a day when systematic efforts were made to protect man and beast\r\nagainst elves and witches; for it was then that people carried crosses\r\nof rowan in their hats and placed may-flowers over the tops of their\r\ndoors and elsewhere as preservatives against all malignant influences.\r\nWith the same object in view, crosses of rowan were likewise fastened to\r\nthe tails of the cattle, small crosses which had to be made without the\r\nhelp of a knife.”\r\n\r\nIn connection with this last reference, Rhys quotes a passage showing\r\nthat a similar thing is done in Wales on May Eve.[47] “Another bad\r\npapistic habit which prevails among some Welsh people is that of placing\r\nsome of the wood of the rowan-tree (_coed cerdin_ or criafol) in their\r\ncorn lands (_ttafyrieu_) and their fields on May-eve (_Nos Glamau_) with\r\nthe idea that such a custom brings a blessing on their fields, a\r\nproceeding which would better become atheists and pagans than\r\nChristians.”\r\n\r\nRhys also tells us that in Lincolnshire,[48] “a twig of the rowan-tree,\r\nor wicken, as it is called, was effective against all evil things,\r\nincluding witches. It is useful in many ways to guard the welfare of the\r\nhousehold, and to preserve both the live stock and the crops; while\r\nplaced on the churn it prevents any malign influence from retarding the\r\ncoming of the butter.”\r\n\r\nWe also read (p. 358): “Not only the Celts, but some also of the\r\nTeutons, have been in the habit of attaching great importance to the\r\nrowan or roan tree, and regarding it as a preservative against the\r\nmalignant influence of witches and all things uncanny.... Moreover, the\r\nSwede of modern times believes the rowan a safeguard against witchcraft,\r\nand likes to have on board his ship something or other made of its wood,\r\nto protect him against tempests and the demons of the water world.”\r\n\r\nIn the Hibbert Lectures, 1886, we have another interesting reference to\r\nthis tree. Rhys first relates an old Irish fairy story, the scene of\r\nwhich is supposed to have been “on the plain near the Lake of Lein of\r\nthe Crooked Teeth, that is to say, the Lake of Killarney.” In it we are\r\ntold that the scarlet quicken-berries were first brought from the “Land\r\nof Promise,” that one was accidentally dropped and took root, and “from\r\nthe berry there grew up a tree which had the virtues of the quicken-tree\r\ngrowing in fairy-land, for all the berries on it had many virtues.” Then\r\nwe learn (page 358) that these berries “formed part of the sustenance of\r\nthe gods, according to Goidelic notions; and the description which has\r\nbeen quoted of the berries makes them a sort of Celtic counterpart to\r\nthe soma-plant of Hindu mythology.”\r\n\r\nThis suggests that at the November Celebration a decoction or brew of\r\nRowan berries was used for curative or superstitious purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have thought it desirable to enter at some length into the use of the\r\nRowan as a protection against witchcraft and as the basis of a brew used\r\nfor different purposes, because the Mistletoe has been dealt with in\r\nexactly the same manner; indeed, it was to the later Solstitial worship\r\nwhat the Rowan and Maythorn were to the earlier May worship.\r\n\r\nMr. Frazer has collected in his _Golden Bough_[49] much information\r\nbearing on these points.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, on Midsummer Eve, Mistletoe is sought after, the people\r\n“believing it to be, in a high degree, possessed of mystic qualities;\r\nand that if a sprig of it be attached to the ceiling of the\r\ndwelling-house, the horse’s stall, or the cow’s crib, the ‘Troll’ will\r\nthen be powerless to injure either man or beast.” The Oak Mistletoe, we\r\nare told, is “held in the highest repute in Sweden, and is commonly seen\r\nin farmhouses hanging from the ceiling to protect the dwelling from all\r\nharm, but especially from fire; and persons afflicted with the falling\r\nsickness think they can ward off attacks of the malady by carrying about\r\nwith them a knife which has a handle of Oak Mistletoe.\r\n\r\n“A Swedish remedy for other complaints is to hang a sprig of Mistletoe\r\nround the sufferer’s neck, or to make him wear on his finger a ring made\r\nfrom the plant.”\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Mr. Frazer’s inquiries that the Mistletoe was _en\r\névidence_ at both the summer and winter solstice--precisely as the Rowan\r\nand Hawthorn were associated with the May and November festivals.\r\n\r\nHe writes:--\r\n\r\n“The sacred mistletoe may have acquired, in the eyes of the Druids, a\r\ndouble portion of its mystic qualities at the solstice in June, and\r\naccordingly they may have regularly cut it with solemn ceremony on\r\nMidsummer Eve. The conjecture is confirmed when we find it to be still a\r\nrule of folklore that the mistletoe should be cut on this day. Further,\r\nthe peasants of Piedmont and Lombardy still go out on Midsummer-morning\r\nto search the oak-leaves for the ‘oil of St. John,’ which is supposed to\r\nheal all wounds made with cutting instruments. Originally, perhaps, the\r\n‘oil of St. John’ was simply the mistletoe, or a decoction made from it.\r\nFor in Holstein the mistletoe, especially oak-mistletoe, is still\r\nregarded as a panacea for green wounds; and if, as is alleged,\r\n‘all-healer’ is the name of the plant in the modern Celtic speech of\r\nBrittany, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, this can be nothing but a\r\nsurvival of the name by which, as we have seen, the Druids addressed the\r\noak, or rather, perhaps, the mistletoe. At Lacaune, in France, the old\r\nDruidical belief in the mistletoe as an antidote to all poisons still\r\nsurvives among the people; they apply the plant to the stomach of the\r\nsufferer, or give him a decoction of it to drink.”\r\n\r\nIf we attempt to collate the different festivals with the vegetation\r\nmost striking or abundant at each, in different countries naturally\r\npossessing different floras, a great variety of plants and trees has to\r\nbe considered. It is probable that the Rowan-tree was chiefly taken here\r\nas the representative of the ash in more southern and eastern lands, and\r\nthe ash indeed did not always take second rank, especially in the\r\nworship connected with wells, as we shall see. Grimm[50] calls the ash\r\n“a world tree which links heaven, earth and hell together; of all trees\r\nthe greatest and holiest.”\r\n\r\nIn the same way at the later established Vernal Equinox festival, the\r\npalm which grows in lower latitudes was replaced here by the willow.\r\nColes, in his _Adam in Eden_,[51] writes: “The willow blossoms come\r\nforth before any leaves appear, and are in their most flourishing state\r\nusually before Easter, divers gathering them to deck up their houses on\r\nPalm Sunday, and therefore the said flowers are called palme.” Willows\r\nare still used to deck churches at this time.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Rowan, the willow (or palm) was a protection\r\nagainst witchcraft; small crosses and palm were carried about in the\r\npurses and placed upon doors. These crosses had to be made on Palm\r\nSunday out of the wood used in the church. Sometimes box replaced the\r\nwillow.\r\n\r\nWe are driven to the conclusion that practices connected with magic, the\r\nprecursor of the later “witchcraft,” were associated with the festivals\r\nnow in question, and that the products of the vegetable world at the\r\ndifferent seasons were utilized for these purposes.\r\n\r\nThe putting on of a special garb by the vegetable world at each season\r\nin turn would be one of the first things to be manifested, and the close\r\nassociation of it with the stars and the sun in their yearly course\r\nwould cause the representatives of it to be worshipped together with\r\nthem, and it would appear from the records that the astronomer priests\r\ndid not neglect those magical arts which were practised by man in the\r\nearly stages of civilisation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, these magical practices seem to have taken such firm root that\r\nit was difficult to get rid of them even in much later times. Newton[52]\r\nwrites: “I once knew a foolish cock-brained priest which ministered to a\r\ncertaine young man the ashes of boxe, being (forsooth) hallowed on Palme\r\nSunday, according to the superstitious order and doctrine of the Romish\r\nChurch, which ashes he mingled with their unholie holie water using to\r\nthe same a kind of... exorcisme; which... medicine (as he persuaded the\r\nstanders by) had vertue to drive away any ague.”\r\n\r\nAmong the virtues attributed to the May thorn was that of preserving the\r\nbeauty of those maidens who at daybreak on May morning each year would\r\nwash themselves in hawthorn dew. As late as 1515 it was recorded that\r\nCatherine of Aragon, accompanied by twenty-five of her ladies, sallied\r\nout on May morning for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[41] Schübeler, _Die Pflanzenwelt Norwegens_, Christiania, 1873-75, p.\r\n439.\r\n\r\n[42] _Hibbert Lectures_, p. 358.\r\n\r\n[43] The Rowan had to be cut on Ascension Day, _Golden Bough_, III, p.\r\n448.\r\n\r\n[44] Pratt’s _British Flowering Plants_, vol. 2, p. 266.\r\n\r\n[45] The word bonfire, according to the _Century Dictionary_, comes from\r\nthe “early modern English, boonfire, bondfire, bounfire, later burnfire;\r\nScotch, banefire; the earliest known instance is banefyre. ‘ignis\r\nossium,’ in the _Catholicon Anglicum_, A.D. 1483; from bone (Scotch,\r\nbane, Middle English, bone, bon, bane, &c.) + fire.”\r\n\r\nHence the word seems formerly to have meant a fire of bones; a funeral\r\npile, a pyre. And it has gradually developed into a fire out in the\r\nopen, whatever its object.\r\n\r\n[46] _Celtic Folklore_, vol. i. p. 308.\r\n\r\n[47] Vol. ii. p. 691.\r\n\r\n[48] _Celtic Folklore_, vol. i. p. 325.\r\n\r\n[49] Second Edition, vol. iii. pp. 343 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[50] _Teutonic Mythology_, Stallybrass’s translation, ii. 796.\r\n\r\n[51] Quoted by Hazlitt under Palm Sunday.\r\n\r\n[52] _Herbal for the Bible_, p. 207.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nHOLY WELLS AND STREAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thought it most important to look up this subject with a view of\r\nseeing whether any clues were available which could help us to associate\r\nthe introduction of the well ceremonials with the worshippers of the May\r\nor of the Solstitial year. For shortness I will call the ceremonial\r\n“baptism,” not necessarily baptism in the modern sense, but as implying\r\nthe use of water for purifying or other religious purpose.\r\n\r\nThat baptism was pre-Christian is shown by John the Baptist using the\r\nJordan for this purpose before Christ’s ministration began. (Matt. 3.\r\n6.)\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous literature[53] dealing with the folklore of holy\r\nwells and streams. The number of holy wells and streams in Britain is\r\nlegion; there are 3,000 in Ireland alone, and the first thing which\r\nstrikes us in a casual study of the folklore is the close association of\r\nthe wells with sacred trees. Almost equally distinctly we gather that\r\nboth were situated near holy stones, and that the worship included\r\nceremonials connected with all three.\r\n\r\nThe folklore dealing with holy wells and well-worship is so various that\r\nit will be useful for our present purpose to classify the portions we\r\nneed under the following headings.\r\n\r\n1. Well-worship outcome of pre-Christian days and customs.\r\n\r\n2. Wells generally situated near circles, dolmens, cromlechs or cairns,\r\nor churches which have replaced them.\r\n\r\n3. Association with sacred trees.\r\n\r\n4. Well-worship and offerings.\r\n\r\n5. Time of the chief festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Pagan origin._--It seems to be accepted now that well-worship in\r\nBritain originated long before the Christian era; that it was not\r\nintroduced by the Christian missionaries, but rather they found it in\r\nvogue on their arrival, and tolerated it at first and utilized it\r\nafterwards, as they did a great many other Pagan customs.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this point Wood-Martin writes:[54]\r\n\r\n“In many Irish MSS. there are allusions to this pre-Christian worship.\r\nFor example, Tirehan relates that St. Patrick, in his progress through\r\nIreland, came to a fountain called Slaun, to which the Druids offered\r\nsacrifices, and which they worshipped as a God; and in Adamnan’s _Life\r\nof St. Columkille_ it is recounted that this saint, when in the country\r\nof the Picts, heard of a notable fountain to which the Pagans paid\r\ndivine honour.”\r\n\r\nHe adds (p. 50):\r\n\r\n“It evidently did not originate in the blessing of wells by early saints\r\nand thus spread downwards, until it became almost, if not quite,\r\nuniversal; on the contrary, it began from the people, who were being\r\nChristianized, and thence permeated the entire system of Irish\r\nChristianity.”\r\n\r\nBaring-Gould tells us much concerning the transitional state (pp. 28 _et\r\nseq._). Wood-Martin divides holy wells into three classes: (1) those\r\nwhich “derive their reputed virtues from Pagan superstition”; (2) those\r\nwhich were “transferred from Pagan to so-called Christian uses,” and (3)\r\n“a few which may lay claim to a merely Christian origin.”[55]\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to understand how the purely devout custom developed in\r\ncourse of time, in the case of some wells at any rate, into a more\r\nsuperstitious one, how some wells came to be called “wishing-wells” and\r\nothers were regarded as prophetic. Rhys gives us several instances of\r\nthese two classes in Wales.[56]\r\n\r\nWishing-wells are known all over the United Kingdom; many authors give\r\naccounts of them.[57]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that in the most ancient times magical practices\r\nwere carried on at wells or at the religious centre of which the well\r\nformed a constituent part. Local practices of witchcraft would be a\r\nnatural survival of these. Gomme (p. 87) thus refers to the well of St.\r\nAelian, not far from Bettws Abergeley, in Denbighshire.\r\n\r\n“Near the well resided a woman who officiated as a kind of priestess.\r\nAnyone who wished to inflict a curse upon an enemy resorted to this\r\npriestess, and for a trifling sum she registered, in a book kept for the\r\npurpose, the name of the person on whom the curse was wished to fall. A\r\npin was then dropped into the well in the name of the victim, and the\r\ncurse was complete.”\r\n\r\nThe magical associations with wells appear in the following extract\r\n(given by Quiller-Couch, p. 134) of a letter from Dr. O’Connor, the\r\nauthor of the letters of Columbanus, to his brother.\r\n\r\n“I have often inquired of your tenants what they themselves thought of\r\ntheir pilgrimages to the wells of _Kill-Aracht_, _Tobbar Brighde_,\r\n_Tobbar Muir_, near Elphin, _Moor_, near _Castlereagh_, where multitudes\r\nannually assembled to celebrate what they, in broken English, termed\r\n_Patterns_ (Patron’s days); and when I pressed a very old man, Owen\r\nHester, to state what possible advantage he expected to derive from the\r\nsingular custom of frequenting in particular such wells as were\r\ncontiguous to an old blasted oak, _or an upright hewn stone_, and what\r\nthe meaning was of the yet more singular custom of _sticking rags_ on\r\nthe branches of such trees and spitting on them, his answer, and the\r\nanswer of the oldest men, was that their ancestors always did it, and\r\nthat it was a preservation against _Geasa Draoidecht_, _i.e._, the\r\nsorceries of the Druids, and that their cattle were preserved by it from\r\ninfectious disorders; that the _daoini maithe_, _i.e._, the fairies,\r\nwere kept in good humour by it; and so thoroughly persuaded were they of\r\nthe sanctity of these Pagan practices that they would travel bareheaded\r\nand barefooted from ten to twenty miles for the purpose of crawling on\r\ntheir knees round these wells, upright stones, and oak trees, westward,\r\nas the sun travels, some three times, some six, some nine, and so on in\r\nuneven numbers until their voluntary penances were completely\r\nfulfilled.”\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Wells generally situated near stone monuments or churches which have\r\nreplaced them._--We find many instances of wells near stone circles and\r\ndolmens.\r\n\r\nIt may even be that the existence of the spring determined the position\r\nof the circle, for the officiating astronomer-priest must like other\r\nmortals have had a water supply available. “Where a spring or a river\r\nflows,” says Seneca, “there should we build altars and offer sacrifices”\r\n(Hope, p. 47). The following shows how closely connected they were.[58]\r\n\r\n“Closely associated with the circles, and occupying an equally important\r\nposition in the religious rites and ceremonies of the ancient\r\ninhabitants, were sacred wells. These were more numerous than circles,\r\nno doubt owing to the fact that their acquisition was more easily\r\naccomplished: but amongst sacred wells we find some, as we find certain\r\ncircles, occupying a position of pre-eminence in the religious cult of\r\ntheir votaries, and these, as a rule, in close proximity to sun and moon\r\ntemples. At Tillie Beltane, in Aberdeenshire, in close proximity to the\r\nremains of a larger and smaller circle, is a well which was held sacred\r\nby the people. According to Col. Leslie, on Beltane and Midsummer days,\r\nthose on whom the dire hand of disease had fallen, or those desirous of\r\naverting that calamity, went seven times round the sacred wells sunwise\r\n(deasil)[59] and then proceeded to the circles, where a like ceremony\r\nwas performed.”\r\n\r\n“In Stenness we find the same association of the well and the circles.\r\nBut in harmony with the unrivalled completeness of these monuments... we\r\nfind the sacred well here in a closer and deeper connection with the\r\ncircles than elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“In the parish of Stenness there is a district called Bigswell, in the\r\ncentre of which is a sacred well, and from which the district takes its\r\nname, Big(s)well.... Be that as it may, we know from tradition that down\r\nto the time when the Stone of Odin was demolished, parents came to the\r\nwell with children, on Beltane and Midsummer, passed round it sunwise,\r\nand having bathed their little ones (a healthy ordeal), carried them\r\nthence to the Stone of Odin, and passed them through the hole as a\r\ndivine protection against the malignant influences of the evil one.”\r\n\r\nBorlase records an instance of a well near a stone-circle in Ireland in\r\nthe Townland of Ballyferriter, in County Kerry.[60]\r\n\r\nThe same author also gives examples in Ireland of wells near dolmens,\r\nand of wells _covered_ by dolmens.[61]\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that in Cornwall Chapel Euny well is associated with\r\nthe circles at Bartinné and Carn Euny; St. Cleer with the three circles\r\nat the Hurlers, and Alsia well is near the Bolleit circle. Mr. Horton\r\nBolitho is my authority for these statements.\r\n\r\nA well is often found near a cell, cairn or _keeill_. Rhys gives us two\r\nexamples in the Isle of Man.[62] At Ardmore Bay the holy well is within\r\nthe ruined chapel of the saint.[63] A vast pile of stones surrounds the\r\nholy well in Glencolumbkille in Donegal.[64]\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to add here that it is a very common thing to find a\r\nwell by a so-called tomb of a saint.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to wells situated near churches.\r\n\r\nIt is very generally known that many churches have been built on the\r\nsites of stone-circles, menhirs, &c. This leads us to think that some\r\nform of worship must have taken place at the “ancient-stones”\r\noriginally. The following extract from Wilson’s _Archæology_ (page 110)\r\nis given in _Stonehenge_ by Sir Henry James (page 17):\r\n\r\n“The common Gaelic phrase--Am bheil thu dol don chlachan--Are you going\r\nto the stones?--by which the Scottish Highlander still enquires at a\r\nneighbour if he is bound for church, seems in itself no doubtful\r\ntradition of ancient worship within the monolithic ring.”\r\n\r\nRhys[65] gives us many instances of wells near churches, and here it may\r\nbe useful to add that the Welsh for well is Ffynnon.\r\n\r\nFfynnon Faglan is described as being near a church, also Ffynnon Fair, a\r\nwishing-well. Criccieth Church is supposed to have had a well near it at\r\none time. Again, Ffynnon Beris is near the parish church of Llanberis\r\n(p. 366), and Ffynnon Elian near to the church of Llanelian,\r\nDenbighshire. Then there are St. Teilo’s Church and Well at Llandeilo\r\nLlwydarth, near Maen Clochog, North Pembrokeshire.\r\n\r\nWood-Martin[66] refers to the rites at the well of Tubberpatrick, part\r\nof the ceremony taking place in the church near by.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Association of sacred wells with sacred trees._--Rhys, and many\r\nother authors, give us several instances of a tree by the side of a\r\nwell.[67]\r\n\r\nWhen we come to deal with well offerings we shall find, in fact, that in\r\nalmost every case a tree has been a necessary companion of the well, as\r\nthe well offerings were hung on them.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, of course, the kind of tree is not specified. When it is,\r\nit is almost invariably the rowan or hawthorn. Rhys tells us: “The tree\r\nto expect by a sacred well is doubtless some kind of thorn.”[68]\r\n\r\nThen again, with reference to Ireland, Rhys, p. 335, quotes a passage\r\nfrom a letter by the late Mr. W. C. Borlase, on Rag Offerings and\r\nPrimitive Pilgrimages in Ireland, to the effect that a hawthorn almost\r\ninvariably stands by the brink of the typical Irish “holy well.”\r\n\r\nThere are also many references to thorn trees in the same position in\r\nWales.\r\n\r\nThere are thorn trees at St. Madron’s well in Cornwall, and at Chapel\r\nwell St. Breward in the same county near Bodmin, there is a thorn tree\r\nover the well.\r\n\r\nNot only are wells often recorded as near sacred trees, but in the case\r\nof some we learn that at the chief annual festival they were decked with\r\nflowers and garlands, and “encircled with a jovial band of young people\r\ncelebrating the day with song and dance.” This is recorded of the\r\n“blessing of the Brine” at Nantwich (Hope, p. 7).\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Well worship and offerings._--Although the traditions and\r\nsuperstitions connected with wells are fast becoming things of the past,\r\nin certain parts they are still believed and practised.\r\n\r\nGomme[69] informs us that well-worship prevails in every county of the\r\nthree kingdoms. He finds it “most vital in the Gaelic countries,\r\nsomewhat less so in the British, and almost entirely wanting in the\r\nTeutonic south-east. In some cases wells were resorted to for the cure\r\nof diseases; in others to obtain change of weather or good luck.\r\nOfferings were made to them to propitiate their guardian gods and\r\nnymphs. Pennant tells us that in olden times the rich would sacrifice\r\none of their horses at a well near Abergelen to secure a blessing upon\r\nthe rest.[70] Fowls were offered at St. Tegla’s Well, near Wrexham, by\r\nepileptic patients,[71] but of late years the well spirits have had to\r\nbe content with much smaller tributes--such trifles as pins, rags,\r\ncoloured pebbles and small coins.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this dwindling down of the offering we have chiefly to\r\ndo with rags, but I think we may learn from the traditions that\r\noriginally it was an offering of a garment, and to the officiating\r\npriest, at the well, or temple with which the well was connected. It is\r\nalso a question whether the almost universal association of pins with\r\nthe garment or part of it might not have originated at a time when such\r\nan offering--it was probably originally a skin--to a priest without a\r\npin (of bone) to fasten it on would not have been complete. In Kent’s\r\ncavern pins of bone have been found associated with bones of palæolithic\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nMr. Gomme tells us,[72] “In the case of some wells, especially in\r\nScotland, at one time the whole garment was put down as an offering.\r\nGradually these offerings of clothes became less and less till they came\r\ndown to rags.” He also points out, as we have already seen, that “the\r\ngeographical distribution of rag-offerings coincides with the existence\r\nof monoliths and dolmens.”\r\n\r\nAs has been noted, almost invariably by the side of every well there\r\ngrows the “sacred tree,” a rowan or thorn for the most part; on this\r\ntree the rags are hung, then the bent pin is dropped in. If there\r\nhappens to be no tree, or if it is so old that only the stump is left,\r\nthen the rags may sometimes be seen wedged in between the stones of the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nQuiller-Couch (p. 135) tells us that at Ahagour in Mayo is a well much\r\nfrequented by pilgrims, for penance chiefly, where among other offerings\r\nthey cut up their clothes, be they ever so new, and tie them to the two\r\nold trees growing near, “lest, on the day of judgment,” thinks the\r\nsuperstitious peasant, “the Almighty should forget that he came there,\r\nand in order that the tokens should be known, when St. Patrick should\r\nlay them before the tribunal.”\r\n\r\nWhen the original well-worship in relation with the temples became\r\ndisestablished, if the well-worship were kept up at all, reasons other\r\nthan the old one would soon be invented, and many of these would\r\nnaturally be connected with magic and sorcery. In the oldest days the\r\npriest would be a physician as well as an astronomer and a magician, and\r\nhis advice might be good for various disorders, but after he had\r\ndisappeared there was only magic to depend upon; and this atmosphere is\r\nreflected in the traditions.\r\n\r\nI will now give a few extracts to show what goes on at present in\r\ncertain localities with regard to the offerings, and the frame of mind\r\nof the devotees.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the reasons for the offerings made in the present day,\r\nWood-Martin writes:[73]\r\n\r\n“Wells were the haunts of spirits that proved to be propitious if\r\nremembered, but were vindictive if neglected, and hence no devotee\r\napproached the sacred precincts empty-handed, the principle being no\r\ngift no cure; therefore the modern devotee, when tying up a fragment\r\nfrom the clothing, or dropping a cake, a small coin, or a crooked pin\r\ninto the well, is unconsciously worshipping the old presiding spirit of\r\nthe place.”\r\n\r\nRhys[74] gives us a great deal of information on this. The ritual varies\r\nat some of them. People came from far and near; it is the custom to make\r\nsome sort of offering, rags and pins being the most modern, and about\r\nthese we have most information as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nRhys quotes statements he has received about three wells in the county\r\nof Glamorgan (Vol. 1, p. 356). At the first it was the custom “that the\r\nperson who wishes his health to be benefited should wash in the water of\r\nthe well, and throw a pin into it afterwards.” At another “the custom\r\nprevails of tying rags to the branches of a tree growing close at hand”;\r\nand at the third, “it is the custom for those who are healed in it to\r\ntie a shred of linen or cotton to the branches of a tree that stands\r\nclose by; and there the shreds are almost as numerous as the leaves.”\r\n\r\nFurther (p. 363) we read of another Ffynnon Faglan, and of this Rhys\r\nsays, “One told me his mother used to take him to it when he was a child\r\nfor sore eyes, bathe them with the water, and then drop in a pin. The\r\nother man, when he was young, bathed in it for rheumatism.” Of this well\r\nit is recorded that when it was cleaned out about fifty years ago “two\r\nbasinfuls of pins were taken out,” which were all bent, but no coins\r\nwere found in it.\r\n\r\nWood-Martin[75] also gives an interesting account of the rite performed\r\nat a certain well in Ireland; it is a little more elaborate than at\r\nsome, but affords an idea of what was probably at one time a very usual\r\nceremony in connection with stones in other places.\r\n\r\n“In a statistical account of the parish of Dungiven, written in 1813, it\r\nis stated that at the well of Tubberpatrick, after performing the usual\r\nrounds, devotees wash their hands and feet with the water and tear off a\r\nsmall rag from their clothes, which they tie on a bush overhanging the\r\nwell; from whence they all proceed to a large stone in the River Roe,\r\nimmediately below the old church, and having performed an oblation they\r\nwalk round the stone, bowing to it, and repeating prayers as at the\r\nwell. Their next movement is to the old church, within which a similar\r\nceremony goes on, and they finish this rite by a procession and prayers\r\nround the upright stone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Time of the chief festival._--On this point there is not a great\r\nquantity of precise information, but what we have points to May 1 as\r\nbeing about the time when the holy wells are most frequented and\r\nconsidered most efficacious.\r\n\r\nThis lack of information arises from the fact that the existence of the\r\nMay year in prehistoric times has not been even dreamt of by those who\r\nhave compiled the various accounts of the fast fading traditions, and in\r\nvery many instances a reference to an unknown saint’s day is the only\r\ninformation given as to the time of the annual celebration. Wide\r\ngeneralisation, therefore, from the material at hand is risky.\r\n\r\nI will refer in the first instance to the May worship, and begin with\r\nthe famous Madron well in Cornwall, the walls of which I found to be\r\noriented to the May sunrise, so that the priest officiating at the altar\r\nwould face the sunrise. Quiller-Couch (p. 137) thus refers to what\r\nhappened there.\r\n\r\n“Children used to be taken to this well on the first three Sunday\r\nmornings in May to be dipped in the water, that they might be cured of\r\nthe rickets, or any other disorder with which they were troubled. Three\r\ntimes they were plunged into the water, after having been stripped\r\nnaked; the parent, or person dipping them, standing facing the sun;\r\nafter the dipping they were passed nine times round the well from east\r\nto west; then they were dressed and laid on St. Madern’s bed; should\r\nthey sleep, and the water in the well bubble, it was considered a good\r\nomen. Strict silence had to be kept during the entire performance, or\r\nthe spell was broken. At the present time the people go to the well in\r\ncrowds on the first Sunday in May, when the Wesleyans hold a service\r\nthere, and a sermon is preached; after which the people throw in two\r\npins or pebbles to consult the spirit, or try for sweethearts; if the\r\ntwo articles sink together, they will soon be married.\r\n\r\n“Here divination is performed on May morning by rustic maidens anxious\r\nto know when they are to be married. Two pieces of straw about an inch\r\nlong are crossed and transfixed with a pin. This, floated on the waters,\r\nelicits bubbles, the number of which, carefully counted, denotes the\r\nyears before the happy day.”\r\n\r\nChapel Euny in Cornwall, near the Bartinné circle, has a wishing (lucky)\r\nwell near it. It was used on one of the three first Wednesdays in May.\r\nChildren suffering from mesenteric disease are dipped three times\r\n“widderschynnes,” that is contrary to the sun’s motion, and dragged\r\nround the well three times in the same direction.[76]\r\n\r\nEdmunds[77] thus refers to this well:--\r\n\r\n“Some years since I had the curiosity to go with a friend to Chapel Euny\r\non one of these Wednesdays, and, whilst watching at a distance, we saw\r\ntwo women come to the well at the appointed hour, and perform this\r\nceremony on an infant.”\r\n\r\n_Alsia Well_, in the parish of Buryan, same parish as Bolleit circle,\r\nhas its well ceremonials on the first three Wednesdays in May.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall the May bathing ceremonial is even carried out in salt\r\nwater.[78] The time chosen is the same as that at Madron and Chapel\r\nEuny, the first three Sundays in May.\r\n\r\nThis Sunday in May celebration is not confined to Cornwall. At Eden\r\nHall, Giant’s Cave, water with sugar is drunk on the third Sunday in\r\nMay. A vast concourse of both sexes is present.[79]\r\n\r\nAt Rorrington, a township in the parish of Chirbury, was a holy well at\r\nwhich a wake was celebrated on Ascension Day.\r\n\r\nIn the account of this well given by Gomme (p. 82) we get a glimpse of\r\nmany associated usages.\r\n\r\n“The well was adorned with a bower of green boughs, rushes, and flowers,\r\nand a may-pole was set up. The people walked round the well, dancing and\r\nfrolicking as they went. They threw pins into the well to bring good\r\nluck and to preserve them from being bewitched, and they also drank some\r\nof the water. Cakes were also eaten; they were round flat buns from\r\nthree to four inches across, sweetened, spiced, and marked with a cross,\r\nand they were supposed to bring good luck if kept.”\r\n\r\nThe legend given by Quiller-Couch (p. 55) respecting St. Cuthbert’s well\r\nin North Cornwall is that “in olden times mothers on Ascension Day\r\nbrought their deformed or sickly children here, and dipped them in, at\r\nthe same time passing them through the aperture connecting the two\r\ncisterns; and thus, it is said, they became healed of their disease or\r\ndeformity. It would seem that other classes also believed virtue to\r\nreside in its water; for it is said that the cripples were accustomed to\r\nleave their crutches in the hole at the head of the well.”\r\n\r\nAt the village of Tissington, near Ashbourne, in Derbyshire, the custom\r\nof well-flowering is still observed on every anniversary of the\r\nAscension (Hope, p. 48).\r\n\r\nWe may gather from these associated observances at different places that\r\nthe wells themselves were situated near circles, for the worshippers\r\nwould not be distributed at such a time. This argument is strengthened\r\nby the custom of “waking the well” which took place on the patron\r\nsaint’s day.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the time of the day or night at which well-worship took\r\nplace, there seems little doubt that for the most part it was carried on\r\nat night. The practices connected with the “waking of the well” indicate\r\nthis clearly, and when it is remembered that these ancient worships were\r\ncarried on at a time when marriage had not been instituted, we can\r\nunderstand that many ‘pagan’ rituals savoured of sensualism as we should\r\nnow think and call it.\r\n\r\nThe particular times when it was considered most propitious for the\r\n_sick_ to visit the wells appear anciently to have been at daybreak or\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\nAt the well at Farr, in Sutherlandshire, it is held that the patient,\r\nafter undergoing his plunge, drinking of the water, and making his\r\noffering, “must be away from the banks so as to be fairly out of sight\r\nof the water before the sun rises, else no cure is effected.” At Roche\r\nHolywell, in Cornwall, before sunrise on holy Thursday was the appointed\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSometimes the moment of sunrise is chosen. To bathe in the well of St.\r\nMedan, at Kirkmaiden in Wigtonshire, as the sun rose on the first Sunday\r\nin May was considered an infallible cure for almost any disease.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in some cases, as at St. Madron’s well, noon is\r\nchosen on the first three Sundays in May, “not believing that these\r\nwaters have any virtue if resorted to on any other days of the year, or\r\nat any other hour of the day.”\r\n\r\nWith regard to the August festival, there is a holy well at St. Cleer,\r\nnear the Hurlers; the festival is held on August 9th.[80] I have no\r\nspecial references to August wells in Ireland, but there is evidence\r\ngiven by Piers[81] that at that time cattle were bathed.\r\n\r\n“On the first Sunday in harvest, viz., in August, they will be sure to\r\ndrive their cattle into some pool or river and therein swim them; this\r\nthey observe as inviolable as if it were a point of religion, for they\r\nthink no beast will live the whole year thro’ unless they be thus\r\ndrenched. I deny not but that swimming cattle, and chiefly in this\r\nseason of the year, is healthful unto them, as the poet hath observed:--\r\n\r\n  “Balantemque gregem fluvio mersare salubri.”--_Virg._\r\n\r\n  In th’ healthful flood to plunge the bleating flock.\r\n\r\nbut precisely to do this on the first Sunday in harvest, I look on as\r\nnot only superstitious but profane.”\r\n\r\nI next come to the solstice in June.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence concerning wells quite akin to that furnished by the\r\nastronomical use of the circles, that the May year festivals were\r\nsubsequently changed to solstitial dates. The well worship does not\r\nappear to have been carried on in the cold weather--hence the absence of\r\nreferences to February and November; for the same reason we have only\r\nnow to do with the summer solstice.\r\n\r\nHazlitt quotes the following from the Irish Hudibras (1689) concerning\r\nJune worship at a well in the North of Ireland:--\r\n\r\n  “Have you beheld, when people pray\r\n   At St. John’s well on Patron-Day,\r\n   By charm of priest and miracle,\r\n   To cure diseases at this well;\r\n   The valleys filled with blind and lame,\r\n   And go as limping as they came.”\r\n\r\nAt Barnwell (Beirna-well = youths’ well), near Cambridge, the festival\r\ntook place on St. John’s Day.[82]\r\n\r\nBrand, in his history of Newcastle (ii. 54), refers to a well still\r\ncalled Bede’s Well, near Jarrow. “As late as 1740 it was a prevailing\r\ncustom to bring children troubled with any disease or infirmity; a\r\ncrooked pin was put in, and the well laved dry between each dipping. My\r\ninformant has seen twenty children brought together on a Sunday, to be\r\ndipped in this well, at which also, on Midsummer Eve, there was a great\r\nresort of neighbouring people, with bonfires, music, etc.”\r\n\r\nHope gives references to seven wells dedicated to “St. John,” one to\r\n“St. John the Baptist,” and four to St. Peter. These _may_ have been\r\nsolstitial wells, but the information given is very slight and not to\r\nthe present point. He states (xxii) that the most important celebrations\r\nwere first held in May and at the summer solstice. He then adds, “later\r\nEaster and Ascensiontide were the favoured seasons.” May, Summer\r\nSolstice and Easter was, I think, the true order.\r\n\r\nFinally, I may refer to the earliest holy well known to history. This is\r\nthe famous well at Heliopolis where Rā used to wash himself, and\r\nPiankhi, B.C. 740, went and washed his face in it. At this same well the\r\nVirgin sat and washed her Son’s swaddling bands in it. Its water made\r\nthe balsam trees to grow. It is now called by the Arabs “The Fountain of\r\nthe Sun” ‘Êyn ash-Shems.\r\n\r\n[53] The literature that I have chiefly consulted is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  R. C.

In this we see the\r\nreason for the local combination of the worship in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe stones, for the stones were really the instruments which enabled the\r\nastronomer-priest to be useful to the community; that he in process of\r\ntime became powerful and sacred because he was wise, and added medicine\r\nand magic to his other qualifications, was only what was to be expected.\r\n\r\nI am not the first to have been driven by the facts to note the close\r\nassociation to which I have referred, that the cults were not separate\r\nbut were parts of one whole.\r\n\r\nWood-Martin speaks with the most certain sound on this point. “It will\r\nbe seen that, from a review of the whole subject, stone, water, tree,\r\nand animal-worship are intimately connected.”[83]\r\n\r\nWhat the analysis in the recent chapters, taken in connection with the\r\nastronomical results previously stated, has done is perhaps to give a\r\nclear reason for the connection. Not only were the cults started\r\ntogether, but they remained together for a long time; it is only in\r\nquite late years that the traditions have become so dim that practices\r\nonce closely connected are now dealt with apart from the rest.\r\n\r\nHope points out (p. xxii) that the 16th of the canons of the reign of\r\nEdgar, A.D. 963, which enjoins the clergy to be diligent, advance\r\nChristianity, and extinguish heathenism, mentions especially the worship\r\nof stones, trees, and fountains. The laws of Knut (A.D. 1018) specify\r\nthe worship “of heathen gods, the sun, moon, fire, rivers, fountains,\r\nrocks, or trees.”\r\n\r\nNow, although the folklore evidence I have brought together has been\r\ngathered for the most part from the British Isles, my inquiries have not\r\nbeen limited to that area.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that when the study of folklore had suggested that there\r\nwas a close connection between the worship carried on in Britain at\r\nstone monuments, sacred trees, and sacred wells an attempt should have\r\nbeen made to see whether these three cults had been associated out of\r\nBritain with the ceremonials of any of the early peoples for which\r\ncomplete and trustworthy information is available.\r\n\r\nOn this point the traditions of widely sundered countries is amazingly\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nThe folklore of the Pyrenees, France, Spain and Portugal regarding\r\nsacred wells is very similar to that of Ireland. Borlase writes:[84]\r\n\r\n“It is interesting to notice that the pre-Christian custom called\r\n_dessil_, or circuit around a venerated spot, which is practised in\r\nIreland in the case of one dolmen at least, as well as at wells and\r\nChurches innumerable, is found also in Portugal.”\r\n\r\nIn the Pyrenees, too, fairies and spirits are thought much of in this\r\nconnection. Borlase tells us:[85] “They are the presiding genii of\r\ncertain wells.” He adds:\r\n\r\n“It is not in Ireland alone that dolmens are associated with the notion\r\nof wells and water springs. The Portuguese names, Anta do Fontao, Fonte\r\nCoberta, Anta do Fonte-de Mouratao, and the French names, Fonte de\r\nRourre, and Fonte nay le Marmion, show this to be the case.”[86]\r\n\r\nIn Persia Sir Wm. Ouseley saw a tree covered with rags, and similar\r\ntrees in the Himalayas are associated with large heaps of stones (Gomme,\r\np. 105).\r\n\r\nThe late General Pitt-Rivers affirms that the customs of well-offerings\r\nI referred to in the last chapter are invariably associated with cairns,\r\nmegalithic monuments or some such early Pagan institutions, and he adds\r\nthat the area in which traces of well-offerings are found is\r\nconterminous with the area of the megalithic monuments.[87]\r\n\r\nThe idea that the waters of certain wells have marvellous healing powers\r\nis also not confined to the British Isles, for in a great many parts of\r\nEurope, perhaps more especially in France, Spain and Portugal, we find\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nThe practice of worshipping in connection with wells and the sacred\r\nstones and sacred trees which were associated with them, as we have\r\nseen, was indeed in ancient days almost, if not quite, universal\r\nwherever man existed. The traditions of the past, therefore, are to be\r\ngathered over a very wide area. I quote a summary of the universality of\r\nthis practice given by the late General Pitt-Rivers in the paper already\r\nnoticed:\r\n\r\n“Burton says it extends throughout northern Africa from west to east;\r\nMungo Park mentions it in western Africa; Sir Samuel Baker speaks of it\r\non the confines of Abyssinia, and says that the people who practised it\r\nwere unable to assign a reason for doing so; Burton also found the same\r\ncustom in Arabia during his pilgrimage to Mecca; in Persia Sir William\r\nOuseley saw a tree _close to a large monolith_ covered with these rags,\r\nand he describes it as a practice appertaining to a religion long since\r\nproscribed in that country; in the Dekkan and Ceylon Colonel Leslie says\r\nthat the trees in the neighbourhood of wells may be seen covered with\r\nsimilar scraps of cotton: Dr. A. Campbell speaks of it as being\r\npractised by the Limboos near Darjeeling in the Himalaya, where it is\r\nassociated, as in Ireland, with large heaps of stones; and Huc in his\r\ntravels mentions it among the Tartars.”\r\n\r\nThe astronomical facts given in this book, gathered from a study of the\r\nmonuments in these islands, can only give us information touching the\r\nintroduction of the combined worship here.\r\n\r\nMy investigations have strongly suggested, to say the least, that there\r\nwere men here with knowledge enough to utilise the movements of the sun\r\nand stars for temple, and no doubt practical purposes before 2000 B.C.,\r\nthat is, a thousand years before Solomon was born, and at about the time\r\nthat the Hecatompedon was founded at Athens.\r\n\r\nIf this is anywhere near the truth, these men must have been\r\nrepresentatives of a very old civilisation.\r\n\r\nNow the civilisation principally considered by archæologists in\r\nconnection with the building of the monuments which I have studied is\r\nthe Aryan, of which the Celts formed a branch. This view, however, is\r\nnot universally held; the late General Pitt-Rivers, and I know of no\r\nhigher authority, stated his opinion that “The megalithic monuments...\r\ntake us back to pre-Aryan people, and suggest the spread of this people\r\nover the area covered by their remains.”[88]\r\n\r\nMr. Gomme is of the same opinion (p. 27):\r\n\r\n“Ceremonies which are demonstrably non-Aryan in India, even in the\r\npresence of Aryan people, must in origin have been non-Aryan in Europe,\r\nthough the race from whom they have descended is not at present\r\nidentified by ethnologists.”\r\n\r\nSergi also points out:--\r\n\r\n“Indo-Germanism led to almost entire forgetfulness of the most ancient\r\ncivilisations of the earth, those born in the valleys of the Euphrates\r\nand the Tigris, and in the valley of the Nile; no influence was granted\r\nto them over Greco-Roman classic civilisation, almost none anywhere in\r\nthe Mediterranean.”[89]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for me to deal at length with the great Aryan\r\ncontroversy in this book, even if the subject were within my competence,\r\nwhich it is not; but now that we have a large number of monuments dated,\r\nsay, within twenty years of their use, it is important to bring forward\r\nsome dates arrived at by archæologists and philologists to compare with\r\nthose which the astronomical method of inquiry has revealed.\r\n\r\nHall[90] gives evidence to show that the Aryans did not reach Greece\r\ntill after the earlier period of the Mycenæan age, which he dates at\r\nabout 1700 B.C.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the date of the Aryan invasion of Britain, Mr. Read, of\r\nthe Department of Ethnography, British Museum, informs me that it may be\r\ntaken as about 1000 B.C.; it was associated with cremation. It is highly\r\nprobable that these Aryans were the Goidels or the Gael. These were\r\nfollowed some 700 years later by another Aryan sept--the Brythons. Mr.\r\nRead is also of opinion that the Goidels reached Britain from the\r\ncountry round the South Baltic, and the Brythons from or through\r\nnorth-east France.\r\n\r\nArchæologists, however, recognise a pre-Aryan invasion, about 1800 B.C.\r\n(a date determined by the introduction of bronze), of a brachycephalic\r\nfolk who built covered barrows, different in these respects from the\r\nneolithic folk, who were long-skulled and built long barrows. Now, in\r\nrelation to the stone structures to which this book especially refers,\r\nthe question arises, are we then dealing with this swarm or the people\r\nwhom they found on the soil?\r\n\r\nThere are some indications in the traditions which imply that we are\r\nreally dealing with an early stone age, when flints were the only\r\nweapons, and there were no clothes to speak of. I will give one or two\r\nexamples of these traditions. Gomme (p. 53) refers to a singular fact\r\npreserved among the ceremonies of witchcraft in Scotland:\r\n\r\n“In order to injure the waxen image of the intended victim, the\r\nimplements used in some cases by the witches were stone arrowheads, or\r\nelf-shots, as they were called, and their use was accompanied by an\r\nincantation. Here we have, in the undoubted form of a prehistoric\r\nimplement, the oldest untouched detail of early life which has been\r\npreserved by witchcraft.”\r\n\r\nGomme (p. 39) also tells us that one of the May practices at Stirling is\r\nfor boys of ten and twelve years old to divest themselves of their\r\nclothing, and in a state of nudity to run round certain natural or\r\nartificial circles. “Formerly the rounded summit of Demyat, an eminence\r\nin the Ochil range, was a favourite scene of this strange pastime, but\r\nfor many years it has been performed at the King’s Knot, in Stirling, an\r\noctagonal mound in the Royal Gardens. The performances are not\r\ninfrequently repeated at Midsummer and Lammas.” He adds, “The fact that\r\nin this instance the practice is continued only by ‘boys of ten and\r\ntwelve years old,’ shows that we have here one of the last stages of an\r\nold rite before its final abolition.”\r\n\r\nBaring-Gould (p. 21) provides us with a practice in Brittany which would\r\nseem to be a remnant of a pre-clothing age.\r\n\r\nNear Carnac is a menhir, at which a singular “ceremony took place till\r\ncomparatively recently, and may perhaps still be practised in secret. A\r\nmarried couple that have no family repair to this stone when the moon is\r\nfull, strip themselves stark naked and course one another round it a\r\nprescribed number of times, whilst their relations keep guard against\r\nintrusion at a respectful distance.”\r\n\r\nNow it is in connection with this question that I am in hopes that some\r\nhelp may be got from the astronomical results recorded in the present\r\nvolume. The dates revealed by the orientation of the circles and\r\noutstanding stones already dealt with (and there is a large number to\r\nfollow) indicate that it is among the records of some people of whom the\r\ncivilisation is very ancient that we must look in the first instance\r\nwith a view of tracing the origin of our British monuments.\r\n\r\nFurther, now that we have been able to follow their astronomical\r\nmethods, to note how sound they were, and to gather the purposes of\r\nutility they were intended to serve, it is simply common sense to\r\ninquire, in the first instance, if they may have been connected with\r\nthese ancient peoples whose astronomical skill is universally\r\nrecognised, and whose records and even observations have come down to\r\nus.\r\n\r\nNow, while we know nothing of the astronomy of the Aryans generally, or\r\nthat of the Celts in particular, the astronomical knowledge of the\r\nBabylonians and Egyptians is one of the wonders of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nHence Babylonia and Egypt are at once suggested, and the suggestion is\r\nnot rendered a less probable one when we remember that both these\r\npeoples studied and utilised astronomy at least some 8,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nBut here we are dealing with two peoples. It is more than probable that\r\nthey both were associated more or less near the origin with one race,\r\nthe ideas of which permeated both civilisations.\r\n\r\nI have it on the highest authority, that of Dr. Budge, that in Babylonia\r\nthere were originally the Sumerians and the Semites. The primitive race\r\nwhich conquered the Egyptians seems to have been connected with the\r\nformer as regards civilisation, and with the latter as regards some\r\naspects of the Egyptian language.\r\n\r\nThis race was Semitic, and as the pyramids, built some 6,000 years ago,\r\nare a proof of the interaction of the two civilisations at that time,\r\nfor the Easter festival celebrated on the banks of the Nile came from\r\nthe valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, we may omit the pre-Semites\r\nfrom our consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is other evidence that the connection between the Semites and\r\nEgyptians was close astronomically, so that any Semitic influence in\r\nlater times or in other lands would be sure to show traces of this\r\nconnection, and in temple worship it would be traceable. While the\r\ncarefully oriented Egyptian temples built of stone remain and have been\r\ncarefully studied, those erected in the centres of Semitic power, built\r\nof unbaked brick, have for the most part disappeared, but for the most\r\npart only; some stone structures remain, but in regard to them there has\r\nbeen no Lepsius; of their orientation, too, little is known. This is all\r\nthe more to be regretted since Layard, in addition to many E. and N.\r\nbuildings found at Nimrood, noted at the mound of Kouyunjik, the site of\r\nNineveh, lat. 36° 20′ N., that Sennacherib’s palace, which appears to\r\nhave been built round a central temple, was oriented to the May\r\nyear.[91] (Az. N. 68° 30′ E. = Dec. N. 16°.)\r\n\r\nNow, calling in the Babylonians as the originators of what went on in\r\nBritain 4,000 years ago may seem to some to be far-fetched in more ways\r\nthan one; but the Babylonians were a remarkable people; according to\r\nsome they originated all the voyaging of the early world, though other\r\nauthorities point out that the first ships in the eastern seas must have\r\nbeen Indian.\r\n\r\nIhering[92] adduces a series of facts which indicate clearly that the\r\nBabylonians carried on maritime navigation at least as early as about\r\n3500 B.C. But, whatever this time was, the Semites and Egyptians had\r\nalready a rich culture behind them at a time when the Aryans, whatever\r\nor wherever their origin, had not made themselves a place in the world’s\r\nhistory. An ancient sea connection between Babylonia and India may\r\nexplain the similarity of the British and Indian folklore.\r\n\r\nSome facts with regard to long distance ancient travel are the\r\nfollowing. Our start-point may be that Gudea, a Babylonian king who\r\nreigned about 2500 B.C., brought stones from Melukhkha and Makan, that\r\nis, Egypt and Sinai (Budge, _History of Egypt_, ii., 130). Now these\r\nstones were taken coastwise Sinai to Eridu, at the head of the Persian\r\nGulf, a distance of 4,000 miles, and it is also said that then, or even\r\nbefore then, there was a coast-wise traffic to and from Malabar, where\r\nteak was got to be used in house- and boat-building. The distance from\r\nEridu coastwise to Malabar, say the present Cannanore, is 2,400 miles.\r\n\r\nThe distance, coastwise, from Alexandria to Sandwich, where we learn\r\nthat Phœnicians and others shipped the tin extracted from the mines in\r\nCornwall, is only 5,300 miles, so that a voyage of this length was quite\r\nwithin the powers of the compassless navigators of 2500 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe old idea that the ancient merchants could make a course from Ushant\r\nto, say, Falmouth or Penzance need no longer be entertained; the\r\ncrossing from Africa to Gibraltar and from Cape Grisnez to Sandwich were\r\nboth to visible land, _i.e._ coastwise. The cliffs on the opposite land\r\nare easily seen on a clear day.\r\n\r\nHence it would have been easier before the days of astronomical\r\nknowledge and compasses to have reached England, and therefore Ireland\r\nand the Orkneys, than to get to some of the islands in the\r\nMediterranean itself.[93]\r\n\r\nIt is seen then that it is possible that Semites might have built our\r\nstone monuments between 2000 and 1200 B.C., while it is quite certain\r\nthat the Aryans did not build them, if the archæologists are not widely\r\nwrong in their dates.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, begin our inquiries by considering the information\r\navailable with regard to the Semites. Let us see in the first instance\r\nwhether they had stone monuments, and sacred trees and sacred wells; a\r\nsystem of worship; and whether this worship was connected with the sun\r\nand stars.\r\n\r\nIt is fortunate for us in this matter that one of the most fully\r\nequipped scholars which the last century produced, Robertson Smith,\r\ndevoted his studies for many years to _The Religion of the Semites_, and\r\ninformation on the points raised is to our hand; all I need do is to\r\ngive as shortly as possible a statement of the various conclusions he\r\nhad reached on the points to which our attention may in the first\r\ninstance be confined. I quote from his book _The Religion of the\r\nSemites_.\r\n\r\nThe Semites include the Babylonians, who spoke a Semitic dialect, for\r\nthere were Sumerian speaking peoples among them, Assyrians, Phœnicians,\r\nHebrews, Arabs and Aramæans, who in ancient times occupied the fertile\r\nlands of Syria, Mesopotamia and Irak from the Mediterranean coast to the\r\nbase of the mountains of Iran and Armenia. They also embrace the\r\ninhabitants of the great Arabian peninsula, which is believed to have\r\nbeen the centre of dispersion.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary artificial mark of a Semitic sanctuary was the sacrificial\r\npillar, cairn, or rude altar (p. 183): it was a fixed point where,\r\naccording to primitive rule, the blood of the offering was applied to\r\nthe sacred stones; or where a sacred tree, as we shall see presently,\r\nwas hung with gifts; the stones and tree being symbols of the God (p.\r\n151).\r\n\r\nFurther, it is certain that the original altar among the northern\r\nSemites was a great unhewn[94] stone, or a cairn, at which the blood of\r\nthe victim was shed (p. 185).\r\n\r\nMonolithic pillars or cairns of stones are frequently mentioned in the\r\nmore ancient parts of the Old Testament as marking sanctuaries; Shechem,\r\nBethel, Gilead, Gilgal, Mizpah, Gibeon, and En-Rogel are referred to (p.\r\n186).\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that in very early times the sanctuary was a cave (p.\r\n183). The obvious successors of a natural cave are, (1) an artificial\r\ncave made in the earth like the natural one, and (2) a model or\r\nrepresentation of a cave built of stone, with a small entrance which\r\nwould be barred, and covered over with earth, thus protecting the\r\npriests from wild animals and the weather.\r\n\r\nThe dolmens and cromlechs which are found in the Semitic area where\r\nthere are stones doubtless had this origin.\r\n\r\nThe use of a cave was probably borrowed both by the Egyptians and Greeks\r\n(there is a cave, for instance, at Eleusis) from the Semites.\r\n\r\nIn later times, when caves or their equivalents were no longer in vogue\r\nand temples were erected, they enclosed a Bit-ili or Beth-el, an upright\r\nstone, consecrated by oil.[95]\r\n\r\nWe next learn (pp. 170 and 183) that no Canaanite high place was\r\ncomplete without its sacred tree standing beside the altar.\r\n\r\nIn tree-worship pure and simple as in Arabia, the tree is adored at an\r\nannual feast (? May), when it is hung with clothes and women’s ornaments\r\n(p. 169).\r\n\r\nThe tree at Mecca to which offerings are made is spoken of as a “tree to\r\nhang things on.”\r\n\r\nThe references to “groves” given in the Bible as associated with temple\r\nworship are misleading, “groves” being a wrong translation of the word\r\nAsherah, which was a pole made of wood which the Jews adopted from the\r\nCanaanites. It was ornamented and perhaps draped, and was most probably\r\noriginally a tree. It may have been used in the “high places” because\r\nsingle trees would not grow there in the East any more than on the moors\r\nin Devon and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of this emblem is proved by Smith’s statement (p. 171)\r\nthat in an Assyrian monument from Khorsābād an ornamental pole is shown\r\nbeside a portable altar. “Priests stand before it engaged in an act of\r\nworship and touch the pole with their hands or perhaps anoint it with\r\nsome liquid substance.”\r\n\r\nThe draping of the tree seems to be proved by the passage which\r\nsuggested the mistranslation to me before I wrote to some Hebrew\r\nscholars among my friends who allowed me to consult them. The passage is\r\nas follows (II. Kings, xxiii., 6, 7):--\r\n\r\n“And he brought out the grove from the house of the Lord, without\r\nJerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and\r\nstamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves\r\nof the children of the people.\r\n\r\n“And he brake down the houses of the Sodomites, that were by the house\r\nof the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the grove.”\r\n\r\nTo show how little variation there was in the Semitic practices to those\r\nrecorded in British folklore I may state that one of my friends--one of\r\nthe revision committee--informed me that his impression was that the\r\nAsherah was furnished with pegs or hooks, so that the garments, &c.,\r\nmight be easily hung on it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI next come to the sacred waters. A sacred fountain, as well as the\r\nsacred tree, was a common symbol at Semitic sanctuaries (p. 183).\r\nNevertheless, they were sometimes absent, the main place being given to\r\naltar worship. Further, Robertson Smith was of opinion that this altar\r\nworship did not originate with tree [? or water] worship (p. 170); but\r\nstill, sacred wells are among the oldest and most ineradicable objects\r\nof reverence among all the Semites, and were credited with oracular\r\npowers (pp. 128, 154). The fountain or stream was not a mere adjunct to\r\nthe temple, but was itself one of the principal _sacra_ of the spot (p.\r\n155).\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there were ordeals among other things at these wells (p.\r\n163). One case is given in Numbers, v., 17, where the words “holy water”\r\noccur, and other water “that causeth the curse” is referred to. Ordeal\r\nby water is not unknown among British customs.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that special sanctity was attached to groups\r\nof seven wells (p. 167), and that one such group was called\r\nThorayga=Pleiades (p. 153).[96] We may gather from this that one of the\r\nmost sacred times for Semitic worship was at the May festival, marked by\r\nthe rising of the Pleiades.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not find many references in Robertson Smith’s book as to\r\ngreat festival days, there is other evidence which shows that the May\r\nfestival was the greatest, and represented New Year’s Day. I have\r\nalready shown that the May-November year is the one recognised in the\r\npresent Turkish, Armenian and I believe Persian calendars (p. 29). As\r\nthis was the year used at Thebes 3200 B.C., we may take it that at that\r\ntime it was universal in W. Asia and the adjacent lands. The Jews\r\nafterwards adopted the equinoctial year.\r\n\r\nIt seems highly probable that we may learn from many passages in the\r\nOld Testament what the Semitic temple practices were generally. There\r\nwere sacrifices of men and beasts, burnt offerings, and lighting of\r\nfires, through which the children were made to pass.\r\n\r\nI give some references to these fire practices.\r\n\r\n“And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to\r\nMolech.”--Leviticus, xviii., 21.\r\n\r\n“There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his\r\ndaughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an\r\nobserver of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,\r\n\r\n“Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a\r\nnecromancer.”--Deuteronomy, xviii., 10, 11.\r\n\r\n“He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his son to\r\npass through the fire.”--II. Kings, xvi., 3.\r\n\r\n“And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the\r\nfire, and used divination and enchantments.”--II. Kings, xvii., 17.\r\n\r\n“And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of\r\nHinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through\r\nthe fire to Molech.”--II. Kings, xxiii., 10. (See also 4 and 5.)\r\n\r\nFire sacrifices which were interpreted as offerings of fragrant smoke\r\nwere prevalent among the settled Semites (p. 218). Sacrificial fat was\r\nburned on the altar. Smith remarks: “This could be done without any\r\nfundamental modification of the old type of sacred stone or altar\r\npillar, simply by making a hollow on the top to receive the grease, and\r\nthere is some reason to think that fire-altars of this simple kind,\r\nwhich in certain Phœnician types are developed into altar candlesticks,\r\nare older than the broad platform altar proper for receiving a burnt\r\noffering” (p. 364).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith regard to the worship of the sun and stars by the Semites, we read\r\nthat the Semite addressed his God as Baal or Bal. The simple form of\r\nBaal was the sun.[97]\r\n\r\nBy the Semites the stars were, on account of their movements, held to be\r\nalive; they were therefore gods, and it was in consequence of this\r\nwidespread belief that the stars were worshipped (p. 127). The\r\nworshippers “burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, to the moon and to\r\nthe planets, and to all the hosts of heaven” (II. Kings, xxiii., 5). Job\r\ncongratulated himself that “his heart had not been enticed, nor his\r\nmouth kissed his hand, if he beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon\r\nwalking in her brightness” (Job, xxxi., 26-27). The worship of the\r\nmorning star as a god is the old Semitic conception (Isa., xiv., 12),\r\n“Lucifer son of the Dawn.”\r\n\r\nWe gather from the later practices of the Saracens that the sacrifices\r\nto the morning star could not be made after the star had disappeared in\r\nthe dawn.[98] The God had to be in the presence of the worshippers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Semitic worship was generally carried on in “high places”; in the\r\nBabylonian temples built in a river valley the “high places” were\r\nsecured by building towers with the sanctuary on the top.\r\n\r\nThese high places were necessary because exact observations of the\r\nrisings of the heavenly bodies formed part of the ceremonial, and a\r\nclear horizon was absolutely imperative. That this was generally\r\nunderstood and acted on is well evidenced by the fact that in the Old\r\nTestament the mention of high places is nearly always associated with\r\nthe references to the religion of the Canaanites and other Semitic\r\nnations as if the high places were among the most important points in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther arguments may be founded upon linguistic considerations. Prof. J.\r\nMorris Jones[99] finds that the syntax of Welsh and Irish differs from\r\nthat of other Aryan languages in many important respects, _e.g._ the\r\nverb is put first in every simple sentence. Prof. Rhys had suggested\r\nthat these differences represented the persistence in Welsh and Irish of\r\nthe syntax of a pre-Aryan dialect, and as the anthropologists hold that\r\nthe pre-Aryan population of these islands came from North Africa, it\r\nseemed to Prof. Jones that that was the obvious place to look for the\r\norigin of these syntactical peculiarities. He finds the similarities\r\nbetween Old Egyptian and neo-Celtic syntax to be astonishing; he shows\r\nthat practically all the peculiarities of Welsh and Irish syntax are\r\nfound in the Hamitic languages.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion practically implies that the bulk of the population of\r\nthese islands, before the arrival of the Celts, spoke dialects allied to\r\nthose of North Africa. The syntactical peculiarities must have\r\nrepresented the habits of thought of the people, which survived in the\r\nCeltic vocabulary imposed upon them.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions were not known to me when I began to see the necessity\r\nof separating the cult of the June from that of the May year, and the\r\nidentity of the conclusions drawn from astronomical and linguistic data\r\nis to me very striking and also suggests further special inquiries.\r\n\r\nIt is also worth while to state that the Semites, including the Hebrews\r\nand Phœnicians, did not burn their dead. Finally, I may quote a remark\r\nmade by General Pitt-Rivers in the paper already referred to:--“If we do\r\nnot accept one old civilization as the origin of the various practices,\r\nthen we must assume accidental origins in each country.”\r\n\r\n[83] Wood-Martin, p. 265.\r\n\r\n[84] _Dolmens of Ireland_, ii., p. 696.\r\n\r\n[85] _Ibid._, ii., p. 580.\r\n\r\n[86] _Ibid._, p. 772.\r\n\r\n[87] _Journal Eth.

Glascott, R.N., who\r\napparently accompanied Mr. Layard. He indicates the true north point\r\nwith a sailor’s precision in such matters. (See p. 305).\r\n\r\n[92] _Evolution of the Aryan_, Translation by Drucker, § 32.\r\n\r\n[93] The prevalence of solstitial customs in Sardinia and Corsica, with\r\napparently no trace of the May year, tends to support this view, which\r\nis also strengthened by the fact that the solstitial customs in Morocco\r\nare very similar to those we read of in Britain: the May year is\r\nunnoticed, and there is a second feast at Easter (March 16th). See\r\nWestermarck in _Folk-lore_, vol. xxi., p. 27.\r\n\r\n[94] And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it\r\nof hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted\r\nit.--Exodus, xx., 25.\r\n\r\n[95] And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he\r\nhad put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon\r\nthe top of it.\r\n\r\nAnd this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and\r\nof all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto\r\nthee.--Genesis, xxviii., 18, 22.\r\n\r\n[96] Herodotus, iii., 8, refers to an Arabian rite in which seven stones\r\nare smeared with blood among peoples whose only gods were Dionysos and\r\nUrania, whom they called Orotalt and Alilat.\r\n\r\n[97] Sayce, _Babylonians and Assyrians_, p. 234.\r\n\r\n[98] _Nili op. quaedam_ (Paris, 1639), pp. 28, 117, quoted by Robertson\r\nSmith, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[99] “Pre-Aryan Syntax in Insular Celtic,” in the _Welsh People_, by\r\nRhys and Brynmor-Jones, pp. 617-641.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE SIMILARITY OF THE SEMITIC AND BRITISH WORSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose in this chapter to bring into juxtaposition the various\r\nBritish and Semitic-Egyptian practices which we have so far considered.\r\n\r\nI confess I am amazed at the similarities we have come across in the\r\nfirst cast of the net; we have found so much that is common to both\r\nworships in connection with all the points we considered separately. I\r\nwill, for convenience, deal with the various points seriatim.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The cult of sacred stones or cairns.\r\n\r\nThe only objection which, so far as I can see, may be raised to these\r\npractices being absolutely common is the idea among many British\r\narchæologists that the cairns, in which term I include chambered barrows\r\nor dolmens and their skeletons, the cromlechs and stone passages, were\r\nset up for burial and not for worship. This idea has arisen because some\r\nof them have been used for burials. But I cannot accept this argument,\r\nbecause since the burials might have taken place at any time subsequent\r\nto their erection they prove nothing as to the reason of the erection;\r\nand further, if these chambered cairns were meant for burials, there\r\nshould be burials in all of them, and yet there are none in the most\r\nmajestic of them all, Maeshowe.\r\n\r\nLet us consider a few facts in relation to the Semitic use of cairns\r\nreferred to on p. 244.\r\n\r\nThat the cromlechs found both in Britain and Syria--there are 780 in\r\nIreland and 700 in Moab--are the remains of chambered cairns is pretty\r\nclear from the evidence brought forward by Borlase.[100]\r\n\r\nMr. John Bell, of Dundalk, disinterred over sixty cromlechs from cairns\r\nin Ulster. All dolmens were covered by tumuli according to Mr. Bell and\r\nMr. Lukis. Monuments called cairns in the earliest Ordnance Survey have\r\nbeen marked dolmens in subsequent surveys (_e.g._ Townland of Leana in\r\nClare) because the earth covering the stones had disappeared in the\r\nmeantime.\r\n\r\nAmong the evidences of natural and artificial caves preceding cairns\r\nwhich replaced them are the twenty-four caves which have been explored\r\nin France (_op. cit._, p. 568).[101]\r\n\r\nBorlase points out with regard to the Irish dolmens that large tumuli\r\nwere not essential; all that was necessary was that the walls of the\r\ncell or crypt should be impervious to the elements and to wild animals.\r\nA creep or passage communicating with the edge of the mound is common to\r\nIreland, Wales, Portugal and Brittany (_op. cit._, p. 428).\r\n\r\nThe facts that the cairns so often had their open ends facing the N.E.\r\nor S.E., and that the west end was generally higher, like the naos\r\ntrilithons at Stonehenge, must be borne in mind.\r\n\r\nMost of what we know of earliest man has been obtained from their lives\r\nin caves; what they ate, the contemporary fauna and their art are thus\r\nknown to us, but caves have not been considered as tombs, though men\r\nhave died and left their remains in them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a dolmen, however, an artificial cave, as we shall see,\r\nthe possibility of people living in them appears never to have been\r\nconsidered seriously, and the tomb theory has led to bad reasoning and\r\nforced argument.\r\n\r\nWhen burials are absent it has been suggested that “owing to some\r\npeculiarity of the soil, the entire of the human remains have become\r\ndecomposed, only the imperishable stone implements entombed with the\r\nbody remaining.”[102]\r\n\r\nMr. Spence has pointed out the extreme improbability of Maeshowe being\r\nanything but a temple, and I may now add on the Semitic model. There\r\nwere a large central hall and side rooms for sleeping, a stone door\r\nwhich could have been opened or shut _from the inside_, and a niche for\r\na guard, janitor or hall porter! So high an authority as Colonel Leslie\r\nhas pointed out that neither Maeshowe, New Grange and Dowth on the\r\nBoyne, nor Gavr Innis in Brittany bear any internal proof of being\r\nspecially prepared as tombs.[103]\r\n\r\nThere is another point connected with these dolmens and cromlechs. An\r\norigin in the Semitic area easily explains why in Asia and Britain the\r\ndolmens are so alike, down to small details, such as the perforation of\r\none of the side stones. Borlase has remarked also upon the similarity of\r\nIndian and Irish dolmens (_op. cit._, p. 755), similar holes also being\r\ncommon to them. The curious concentric circles, &c., found on some\r\ndolmen stones are common to Assyrian vessels.[104]\r\n\r\nThe most philosophical study of this question I have seen[105] certainly\r\nsuggests that much light may be expected from this source.\r\n\r\nPart of the cult of the sacred stones was the ceremony of _anointing\r\nthem_. Robertson Smith (p. 214) gives us the meaning and history of\r\nanointing among the Semites, and notes its continuation from Jacob’s\r\npouring oil on sacred stones at Bethel, through the time of Pausanias to\r\nthat of the Pilgrims of the fourth century A.D.\r\n\r\nThe anointing of stones was certainly carried on in ancient times in\r\nBritain and Brittany. Baring-Gould tells us:[106]\r\n\r\n“Formerly the menhir was beplastered with oil and honey and wax, and\r\nthis anointing of the stones was condemned by the bishops. In certain\r\nplaces the local clergy succeeded in diverting the practice to the\r\nChurches. There are still some in Lower Brittany whose exterior walls\r\nare strung with wax lines arranged in festoons and patterns.\r\n\r\n“In some places childless women still rub themselves against menhirs,\r\nexpecting thereby to be cured of barrenness, but in others, instead,\r\nthey rub themselves against stone images of saints.”\r\n\r\nWhen I visited the Cave of Elephanta in 1871 I was told that the barren\r\nwomen of Bombay visit the cave once a year and anoint the standing stone\r\nin the chief chamber. In Egypt they still rub their bodies on the\r\nColossi.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Sacred fires.\r\n\r\nAmong the Semites the sacrificial fat was burned on the altar. And we\r\nhave seen that “this could be done without any fundamental modification\r\nof the old type of sacred stone or altar pillar, simply by making a\r\nhollow on the top to receive the grease.”[107]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Cresset-stone, Lewannick. From Baring-Gould’s\r\n_Strange Survivals_.]\r\n\r\nBaring-Gould[108] has written on the question of sacrificial and sacred\r\nfires in ancient times in Britain, and points out that there still\r\nremain in some of our churches (in Cornwall, York and Dorset) the\r\ncontrivances--now called cresset-stones--used. They are blocks of stone\r\nwith cups hollowed out precisely as described by Robertson Smith. Some\r\nare placed in lamp-niches furnished with flues. On these he remarks (p.\r\n122):--\r\n\r\n“Now although these lamps and cressets had their religious\r\nsignification, yet this religious signification was an afterthought. The\r\norigin of them lay in the necessity of there being in every place a\r\ncentral light, from which light could at any time be borrowed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The cult of the sacred tree.\r\n\r\nI have shown that the sacred trees in Britain, whether rowan, thorn or\r\nmistletoe, were at their best at the times of the festivals at which\r\nthey were chiefly worshipped. Mrs. J. H. Philpot, in her valuable book\r\non “the sacred tree,” gives us the names of some used in different\r\ncountries; it would be interesting to inquire whether the same\r\nconsideration applies to them in the Semitic and other areas.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that the Semitic Asherah was the precursor of\r\nthe British Maypole, even to its dressing of many coloured ribands, and\r\nfrom the Maypole customs we may infer something of the Semitic practices\r\nwhich have not come down to us. Even “Jack o’ the Green” may eventually\r\nbe traced to Al-Khidr (p. 29) of the old May festivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The cult of the sacred well.\r\n\r\nHere we find only trifling differences. The chief one is the use of\r\npins in Britain. If we knew more about the Asherah with its hooks this\r\ndifference might disappear.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out by several authors that the worship of wells and\r\nwater would be most likely to arise in a dry and thirsty land.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The time of the chief festivals.\r\n\r\nHere we find beyond all question that the festival times were the same\r\nto begin with. May is the chief month both in West Asia and West Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was not till a subsequent time that June and December were added in\r\nEgypt and Britain, and April and September among the Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The characteristics of the festivals.\r\n\r\nHere again is precise agreement. The list I gave on p. 205 of what can\r\nbe gathered from British folklore is identical with the statements as to\r\nSemitic practices which I quoted from Robertson Smith in the last\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The worship in high places.\r\n\r\nAbsolute identity; and from this we can gather that the ancient\r\ncondition of the high places wherever selected for temple worship was as\r\ntreeless as it is now; otherwise the observations of sun- and star-rise\r\nand -set would be greatly interfered with.\r\n\r\nOf course, there may have been “groves” associated with, but away from,\r\nsanctuaries in both Semitic and British areas: but it is not impossible\r\nthat much which has been written on this subject with regard to Britain\r\nand the “Druids” may have been suggested in part by the erroneous\r\ntranslation of Asherah to which I have referred. It has also been stated\r\nthat an early transcriber who, in error, substituted lucus for locus may\r\nalso be held partly responsible, even if lucus does not mean a clearing\r\nin a grove, as some maintain.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. The god or gods worshipped.\r\n\r\nThe year-gods in Babylonia and Egypt respectively were Baal and Thoth.\r\nIt is worth while to inquire whether either name has made its appearance\r\nas a loan-word in the traditions of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nAbout Baal there can be no question as to the coincidence, whether\r\naccidental, as some philologists affirm, or not.\r\n\r\nWe find Bel or Baal common to the two areas. Mr. Borlase informs us\r\n(_op. cit._, p. 1164) that in Western Europe Bel, Beal, Balor, Balder,\r\nand Phol, Fal, Fáil are the equivalents of the Semitic Baal. Balus,\r\nindeed, is named as the first king of Orkney. A May worship is connected\r\nwith all the above. Beltaine and many variants describe the fires\r\nlighted at the festival, and it is worthy of note that although this\r\nfire worship has been extended to the solstitial ceremonials in June,\r\nthe name Baltaine has never been applied to it at that time except by\r\nwriters who think that the term “midsummer” may be applied\r\nindiscriminately to the beginning of May and the end of June.\r\n\r\nI next deal with the Egyptian year-god Thoth. In Greece he became\r\nHermes, among the Romans Mercury. In this connection I can most usefully\r\nrefer to Rhys’s Hibbert Lectures and his chapter on the Gaulish\r\nPantheon. He tells us (p. 5) that “Mercury is the god with whom the\r\nmonuments lead one to begin.” There is also mention of a god Toutates or\r\nTeutates, and a Toutius, who might have been a public official (? priest\r\nof Toutates). Only Celtic or other later origins of the words are\r\nsuggested; it is not said whether the possible Egyptian root has been\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nWe may even, I think, go further and ask whether some of the\r\nconstellations were not figured as in Egypt, otherwise it is difficult\r\nto account for the horror of the black pig (p. 195) at Hallowe’en. The\r\nwhole Egyptian story is told in my _Dawn of Astronomy_[109] in\r\nconnection with the worship of Set, that is the stars visible at night,\r\nblotted out at dawn by the rising sun, or becoming predominant after\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. The worship of the sun and stars.\r\n\r\nHere also, as I have shown, is complete agreement. The same astronomical\r\nmethods have been employed for the same purpose. The chief difference\r\nlies in the fact that by lapse of time the precessional movement caused\r\ndifferent stars to be observed as clock stars or to herald the sunrise\r\non the chief ceremonial days.\r\n\r\n[100] _Dolmens of Ireland_, p. 426.\r\n\r\n[101] “France, indeed, furnishes us with a stepping-stone, as it were,\r\nbetween the natural cave and the dolmen in certain artificial caves\r\nwhich offer comparison both with the former and the latter... the\r\nnatural cave was scooped out into a large chamber or chambers either by\r\nthe swirling of water pent up in the limestone or other yielding rock\r\nand finding its way out through some narrow crevice. The ground plan and\r\nsection, therefore, is that of an _allée couverte_ with a vestibule...\r\nthe artificial cave is modelled on the natural one, and yet bears, as M.\r\nMortillet points out, a close resemblance to the dolmen.”\r\n\r\n[102] Wandle, _Remains of Prehistoric Age in England_, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[103] It is interesting to point out in relation to the fact that\r\ndifferent swarms successively introduced the May and solstitial years\r\nthat the “sleeping rooms” of the May year cairns at New Grange are about\r\n3 feet square, while at the solstitial Maeshowe, built very much later,\r\nthe dimensions are 6 feet × 4¹⁄₂ feet. There were differences of\r\nsleeping posture in the old days among different peoples as well as\r\ndifferent methods of burial.\r\n\r\n[104] Borlase, p. 617.\r\n\r\n[105] “The Builders and the Antiquity of our Cornish Dolmens,” by Rev.\r\nD. Gath Whitley (_Journal R.I.

This was the chief\r\nrevelation of the monuments when they were studied from the astronomical\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nWithout confirmation from some other sources this result might have been\r\nconsidered as doubtful, and the orientation theory might have been\r\nthought valueless. It has, however, been seen that folklore and\r\ntradition confirm it up to the hilt. I think it may be said, therefore,\r\nthat the theory I put forward in this book touching the astronomical use\r\nof our ancient temples is so far justified.\r\n\r\nThe British monuments I had considered before this appeal to tradition\r\nwas made were the circles at Stonehenge, Stenness, The Hurlers and\r\nStanton Drew, and the avenues on Dartmoor. These were studied generally,\r\nthe main special result being that to which I have referred; we not only\r\nfound alignments to sunrise and sunset on the critical quarter-days of\r\nthe May years, but we found alignments to the stars which should have\r\nbeen observed either at rising or setting to control the morning\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nBut this inquiry had left out of account several circles in south-west\r\nCornwall, of which I had vaguely heard but never seen. When I had\r\nwritten the previous chapters showing how fully May-year practices are\r\nreferred to in the folklore of that part of the country, I determined to\r\nvisit the circles, dealing with them as test objects in regard to this\r\nspecial branch of orientation. I had not time to make a complete survey;\r\nthis I must leave to others; but with the help so readily afforded me,\r\nwhich I shall acknowledge in its proper place, I thought it possible in\r\na brief visit to see whether or not there were any May-year alignments.\r\nIn the following chapters I will give an account of the observations\r\nmade, but before doing so, in order to prove how solid the evidence\r\nafforded by the Cornish monuments is, I will state the details of the\r\nlocal astronomical conditions depending upon the latitude of the Land’s\r\nEnd region, N. 50°. In the chapter containing some astronomical hints to\r\narchæologists I referred (p. 122) to the solstice conditions for\r\nStenness beyond John o’ Groat’s, because those conditions afforded a\r\nspecial case, the solstice being determined by the arrival of the sun at\r\nits highest or lowest declination, which happens on particular dates\r\nwhich recur each year. But with regard to the May year, during the\r\nfirst week of May the sun’s declination is changing by over a quarter of\r\na degree daily, so that we must not expect to find the declination of\r\n16° 20′ (see p. 22) rigidly adhered to.\r\n\r\nAs I have shown (p. 23), the sun’s passage through this declination four\r\ntimes on its annual path on the dates stated accurately divides the year\r\ninto four equal parts. But this accuracy might have been neglected by\r\nthe early observers, so that, for instance, the sun’s position on the\r\n4th or 8th of May instead of that on the 6th might have been chosen as\r\nbeing in greater harmony with the agricultural conditions at the place.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the sunrise from John o’ Groat’s to Land’s End, 2′ of\r\nthe sun being visible above the sky-line, can be gathered from the\r\nfollowing diagram:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Place of first appearance of the May sun, in\r\nBritish latitudes.\r\n\r\n~Vertical axis: N.

From left: 55-67.~\r\n\r\n~Curves, from left: HORIZON, 0° HILL, 2°HILL.~]\r\n\r\nThe exact azimuths for this sunrise in the Land’s End region (Lat. 50°)\r\nin relation to the place of the sunrise when half the sun has risen,\r\nwith a sea horizon, are shown in Fig. 51.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Showing the influence of the height of the\r\nsky-line on the apparent place of sunrise in May and August. The double\r\ncircle shows the tabular place of sun’s centre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE MERRY MAIDENS CIRCLE (LAT. 50° 4′ N.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best preserved circles that I know of is near Penzance. It is\r\ncalled the Merry Maidens[110] (Dawns-Maen), and is thus described by\r\nLukis[111] (p. 1):--\r\n\r\n“This very perfect Circle, which is 75 feet 8 inches in diameter, stands\r\nin a cultivated field which slopes gently to the south.\r\n\r\n“It consists of 19 granite stones placed at tolerably regular distances\r\nfrom each other, but there is a gap on the east side, where another\r\nstone was most probably once erected.\r\n\r\n“Many of the stones are rectangular in plan at the ground level, vary\r\nfrom 3 feet 3 inches to 4 feet in height, and are separated by a space\r\nof from 10 to 12 feet. There is a somewhat shorter interval between\r\nfour of the stones on the south side.\r\n\r\n“In the vicinity of this monument are two monoliths called the Pipers;\r\nanother called Goon-Rith; a holed stone (not long ago there were two\r\nothers); and several [5] Cairns.”\r\n\r\nLukis thus describes the “Pipers”:--\r\n\r\n“Two rude stone pillars of granite stand erect, 317 feet apart, and\r\nabout 400 yards to the north-east of the Circle of Dawns-Maen. No. 1 is\r\n15 feet high, 4 feet 6 inches in breadth, and has an average thickness\r\nof 22 inches, and is 2 feet 9 inches out of the perpendicular. The stone\r\nis of a laminated nature, and a thin fragment has flaked off from the\r\nupper part. No. 2 is 13 feet 6 inches high, and is much split\r\nperpendicularly. At the ground level its plan in section is nearly a\r\nsquare of about 3 feet.”\r\n\r\nGoon-Rith is next described:--“No. 3 is naturally of a rectangular form\r\nin plan, and is 10 feet 6 inches in height. The land on which it stands\r\nis called Goon-Rith, or Red Downs. The upper part of the stone is of\r\nirregular shape.”\r\n\r\nBorlase, in his _History of Cornwall_ (1769), only mentions the circle,\r\nbut W. C. Borlase, in his _Nænia Cornubiæ_ (1872), gives a very rough\r\nplan including the stones before mentioned and several barrows, some of\r\nwhich have been ploughed up.\r\n\r\nAt varying distances from the circle and in widely different azimuths\r\nare other standing stones, ancient crosses and holed stones, while some\r\nof the barrows can still be traced.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of the locality given by Borlase and Lukis, however,\r\ndo not exhaust the points of interest. Edmonds[112] writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n“A cave still perfect... is on an eminence in the tenement of Boleit\r\n(Boleigh) in St. Buryan, and about a furlong south-west of the village\r\nof Trewoofe (Trove). It is called the ‘Fowgow,’ and consists of a trench\r\n6 feet deep and 36 long, faced on each side with unhewn and uncemented\r\nstones, across which, to serve as a roof, long stone posts or slabs are\r\nlaid covered with thick turf, planted with furze. The breadth of the\r\ncave is about 5 feet. On its north-west side, near the south-west end, a\r\nnarrow passage leads into a branch cave of considerable extent,\r\nconstructed in the same manner. At the south-west end is an entrance by\r\na descending path; but this, as well as the cave itself, is so well\r\nconcealed by the furze that the whole looks like an ordinary furze break\r\nwithout any way into it. The direction of the line of this cave is about\r\nnorth-east and south-west, which line, if continued towards the\r\nsouth-west, would pass close to the two ancient pillars called the\r\nPipers, and the Druidical temple of Dawns Myin, all within half of a\r\nmile.”\r\n\r\nThis fougou is situated on a hill on the other side of the Lamorna\r\nValley, near the village of Castallack, and the site of the Roundago\r\nshown in the 1-inch Ordnance map.\r\n\r\nBorlase[113] says that many similar caves were to be seen “in these\r\nparts” in his time, and others had been destroyed by converting the\r\nstones to other uses.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the circle conditions at the Merry Maidens were\r\nonce similar to those at Stenness, Stanton Drew, the Hurlers, Tregaseal\r\nand Botallack, that is that there was more than one, the numbers running\r\nfrom 2 to 7. Mr. Horton Bolitho, without whose aid in local\r\ninvestigations this chapter in all probability would never have been\r\nwritten, in one of his visits came across “the oldest inhabitant,” who\r\nremembered a second circle. He said, “It was covered with furze and\r\nnever shown to antiquarians”; ultimately the field in which it stood was\r\nploughed up and the stones removed. It is to prevent a similar fate\r\nhappening to the “Merry Maidens” themselves that Lord Falmouth will not\r\nallow the field in which they stand to be ploughed, and all antiquarians\r\ncertainly owe him a debt of gratitude for this and other proofs of his\r\ninterest in antiquities. Mr. Bolitho carefully marked the site thus\r\nindicated on a copy of the 25-inch map. I shall subsequently show that\r\nthe circle which formerly existed here, like the others named, was\r\nlocated on an important sight-line.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton Bolitho was good enough to make a careful examination of the\r\nbarrows A and B of Borlase.[114] In A (S. 69° W.) he found a long stone\r\nstill lying in the barrow, suggesting that the barrow had been built\r\nround it, and that the apex of the barrow formed a new alignment. In B\r\nthere is either another recumbent long stone or the capstone of a\r\ndolmen. This suggests work for the local antiquarians.\r\n\r\nI should state that there may be some doubt about barrow A, for there\r\nare two not far from each other with approximate azimuths S. 69° W. and\r\nS. 64° W. The destruction of these and other barrows was probably the\r\naccompaniment of the reclamation of waste lands and the consequent\r\ninterference with antiquities which in Cornwall has mostly taken place\r\nsince 1800.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo. by Lady Lockier._\r\n\r\nFIG. 52.--The Merry Maidens (looking East).]\r\n\r\nBut it did not begin then, nor has it been confined to barrows. Dr.\r\nBorlase, in his parochial memoranda under date September 29, 1752,\r\ndescribes a monolith 20 feet above ground, and planted 4 feet in it, the\r\n“Men Peru” (stone of sorrow) in the parish of Constantine. A farmer\r\nacknowledged that he had cut it up, and had made twenty gate-posts out\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I visited the Merry Maidens at Easter, 1905, for the\r\npurpose of making a reconnaissance. Mr. Horton Bolitho and Mr. Cornish\r\nwere good enough to accompany us.\r\n\r\nOn my return to London I began work on the 25-inch Ordnance map, and\r\nsubsequently Colonel R. C. Hellard, R.E., director of the Ordnance\r\nSurvey, was kind enough to send me the true azimuths of the Pipers. In\r\nOctober, 1905, Mr. Horton Bolitho and Captain Henderson, whose help at\r\nthe Hurlers I have already had an opportunity of acknowledging, made a\r\nmuch more complete survey of the adjacent standing stones and barrows.\r\n\r\nIn this survey they not only made use of the 25-inch map, but of the old\r\nplan given by W. C. Borlase dating from about 1870. Although the\r\noutstanding stones shown by Borlase remain, some of the barrows\r\nindicated by him have disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1906, my wife and I paid other visits to the monuments, and\r\nMr. Horton Bolitho was again good enough to accompany us. Thanks to him\r\npermission had been obtained to break an opening in the high\r\nwall-boundary which prevented any view along the “Pipers” sight-line. I\r\nmay here add that unfortunately in Cornwall the field boundaries often\r\nconsist of high stone walls topped by furze, so that the outstanding\r\nstones once visible from the circles can now no longer be seen from\r\nthem; another trouble is that from this cause the angular height of the\r\nsky-line along the alignment cannot be measured in many cases.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to refer to the chief sight-lines seriatim. The first\r\nis that connecting the circle which still exists with the site of the\r\nancient one. On this line exactly I found four points, a barrow (L)\r\nwhich Borlase had missed (further from the circle than his barrow A),\r\nthe site, the present circle, and the fougou; azimuth from centre of\r\ncircle N. 64° E. and S. 64° W. This is the May-year line found at\r\nStonehenge, Stenness, the Hurlers and Stanton Drew.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this there is another sight-line which must not be\r\npassed over; from the circle the bearing of the church of St. Burian is\r\nabout N. 64° W.; like the fougou it is situated on a hill, and near it\r\nare ancient crosses which I suspect were menhirs first and crosses\r\nafterwards.[115] However this may be, we see in this azimuth of 64°\r\nthree times repeated that the May and August sunrises and sunsets and\r\nthe February and November sunsets were provided for.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the other sight-lines I will begin with that of the\r\nPipers, as it is quite obviously connected with the eastern circle only;\r\nthe stones could not have been seen from the other on account of rising\r\nground. The barrow shown in this direction by Borlase has now entirely\r\ndisappeared, and the earth has evidently been spread over the\r\nsurrounding field; its surface is therefore higher than formerly, so\r\nthat when the opening was made in the wall the top of the nearest piper\r\ncould not be seen from the centre of the circle; an elevation of about 2\r\nfeet from the ground level was necessary. Walking straight from the\r\ncircle to the first piper, the second piper was exactly in a line,\r\nthough at a much lower level. This showed that the Ordnance values were\r\nnot quite accurate, which was not to be wondered at as no direct\r\nobservation had been possible. I therefore adopted the mean of the\r\nOrdnance values as the true azimuth:--\r\n\r\n  Piper 1.--N. 37° 58′ 36″ E.\r\n  Piper 2.--   38  52  36\r\n               ----------\r\n  Mean         38  25  36\r\n\r\nThe sky-line from the centre of the circle was defined by the site of\r\nthe vanished barrow, angular elevation 20′, and it is highly probable\r\nthat the function of the barrow when built was to provide a new\r\nsight-line when the star-rise place was no longer exactly pointed out by\r\nthe piper line.\r\n\r\nWith these data the star in question was Capella, dec. 29° 58′ N.,\r\nheralding the February sunrise, 2160 B.C.\r\n\r\nI next come to the famous menhir Goon-Rith. The conditions are as\r\nfollows:--from the circle Az. S. 81° 35′ W. Altitude of sky-line 34′.\r\n\r\nConcerning this alignment from the circle, it may be stated that it cuts\r\nacross many ancient stones, including one resembling a rock basin or\r\nlaver, and another either a holed stone or the socket of a stone cross.\r\nI suspect also the presence in old days of a holy well attached to the\r\ncircle, for there is a pool of water in a depression which is shown in\r\nthe 25-inch map.\r\n\r\nI regard it as quite possible that we are here in presence of the\r\nremains of a cursus, an old _via sacra_, for processions between the\r\ncircle and the monolith.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to find any astronomical use for this stone from\r\nthe circle or from the site of the old one, but if we suppose it to have\r\nbeen used like the Barnstone at Stenness for observations _over_ the\r\ncircle its object at once becomes obvious.\r\n\r\nFrom the azimuth given, the declination of the star was 5° 24′ N. Now\r\nthis was the position of the Pleiades B.C. 1960, when they would have\r\nwarned the rising of the May sun.\r\n\r\nSo that it is possible that the erection of the Pipers and of Goon-Rith\r\ntook place at about the same time, and represent the first operations.\r\n\r\nThe next alignment has an azimuth of S. 69° W. from the circle; it would\r\nbe the same within a degree from the site of the one which has\r\ndisappeared; altitude of sky-line 32′; this line is to a stone cross on\r\nrising ground,[116] doubtless a re-dressing of an old menhir, and on the\r\nline nearer the circle are the remains of a barrow.\r\n\r\nWith these data the star in question was Antares, dec. S. 13° 18′,\r\nheralding the May sunrise 1310 B.C.\r\n\r\nThere is another stone cross defining a line az. N. 11° 45′ E. from the\r\ncircle, altitude of sky-line about the same as along the Piper azimuth;\r\nan intervening house prevents measurement. These values give us N. dec.\r\n38° 46′, referring to Arcturus warning the August sunrise in 1640 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe three alignments already referred to, then, give us the warning\r\nstars for three out of the four quarter-days of the May year.\r\n\r\nThere is still another stone cross, Az. N. 82° 5′ W., hills about 34′.\r\nThis has no connection with the May year, but may refer to the\r\nequinoctial one.\r\n\r\nW. C. Borlase refers to several holed stones. The data for two of these,\r\nsupplied by Capt. Henderson, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                   Az.       Alt. of sky-line\r\n  Stone in hedge N. of road    S. 50°33′ E.        45′\r\n  Stone, half still standing   S. 79 25  W.        49\r\n\r\nAzimuths near these have been noted before at other circles, and it must\r\nnot be forgotten that as the holed stones on my view were used for\r\nobservation, these azimuths must be reversed, since it is probable that\r\nthe observations were made over the circle. If this were so, then S.E.\r\nwould be changed into N.W., and we should get N. 50° 33′ W. indicating\r\nthe solstitial sunset. Similarly, S.W. would become N.E., and we should\r\nhave N. 79° 25′ E., possibly a Pleiades alignment.\r\n\r\nI have brought together in the following table all the sight-lines so\r\nfar referred to. Where the altitude of the sky-line has been measured it\r\nis marked with a *.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--25-inch Ordnance Map of Merry Maidens, showing\r\nalignments.]\r\n\r\nIn the map the probable site of the second circle and the barrows have\r\nspecial marks attached to them.

It is a short title for 19 maidens. Lukis implies\r\nthat Dawns-Maen once consisted of 20 stones. If all the circles followed\r\nsuit it would be interesting to note if the present number of 19 is\r\nalways associated with a gap on the eastern side. The “pipers” are, of\r\ncourse, the musicians who keep the maidens merry, as does the “blind\r\nfiddler” at Boscowen-un Circle.\r\n\r\n[111] _Prehistoric Stone Monuments, Cornwall._\r\n\r\n[112] _The Land’s End District_, p. 46.\r\n\r\n[113] _Antiquities_, p. 274.\r\n\r\n[114] _Nænia_, p. 214.\r\n\r\n[115] In A.D. 658 a council assembled at Nantes decreed:--“As in remote\r\nplaces and in woodlands there stand certain stones which the people\r\noften worship, and at which vows are made, and to which oblations are\r\npresented--we decree that they be all cast down and concealed in such a\r\nplace that their worshippers may not be able to find them.”\r\n\r\n“Now the carrying out of their order was left to the country parsons,\r\nand partly because they had themselves been brought up to respect these\r\nstones, and partly because the execution of the decree would have\r\nbrought down a storm upon their heads, they contented themselves with\r\nputting a cross on top of the stones.”--_Book of Brittany_, by\r\nBaring-Gould, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[116] With regard to this Mr. Horton Bolitho has sent me the following\r\nnote:--“The rising ground here is called locally ‘Lanine Hill’ (spelt\r\nLanyon and pronounced Lanine); this is worth noticing, as it is the same\r\nname as the dolmen six or seven miles away from Boleit, and in the same\r\ndistrict as the Men an Tôl and Boskednan Circle, to say nothing of\r\nLannion in Brittany. Lan signifies something sacred, the place of the\r\nsaint, or belonging to the saint.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE TREGASEAL CIRCLES (LAT. 50° 8′ 25″ N., LONG. 5° 39′ 25″ W.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two circles situated on Truthwall Common near to Tregaseal and\r\nnot far from St. Just; the one is nearly to the east of the other, and\r\nthere are outstanding stones, including four holed stones, and several\r\nbarrows. The eastern temple has a diameter of 69 feet, and includes, at\r\nthe present time, nine erect and four prostrate stones; the original\r\nstructure seems to have contained twenty-eight stones according to\r\nLukis.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I visited the region in January, 1906, but previously to our\r\ngoing Mr. Horton Bolitho, accompanied by Mr. Thomas, whose knowledge of\r\nthe local antiquities is very great, had explored the region and taught\r\nus what to observe.\r\n\r\nThe chief interest appears to lie on the N.E. quadrant, where, in\r\naddition to a famous longstone on a hill about a mile away, the nest of\r\nholed stones and several of the barrows are located. Carn Kenidjack, a\r\nfamous landmark, lies to the north.\r\n\r\nOf the two circles, I confined my attention almost exclusively to the\r\neastern one, as the other is in a fragmentary condition, though it is\r\nstill traceable. It is hidden almost entirely from the eastern circle by\r\na modern hedge.\r\n\r\nMr. Horton Bolitho, who accompanied us in January, has again visited the\r\nspot, with Mr. Thomas, for the purpose of further exploration, and\r\ndetermining the angular height of the sky-line along the different\r\nalignments, which I have plotted from the 6-inch and 25-inch maps. My\r\nreaders will therefore see that my part of the work has been a small\r\none, and that they are chiefly indebted to those I have named.\r\n\r\nNo theodolite survey has as yet been made for determining the azimuths\r\nand the height of the hills. The following approximate azimuths have\r\nbeen determined by myself from a 25-inch map, and the elevations by Mr.\r\nHorton Bolitho by means of a miner’s dial.\r\n\r\n         Alignments.

The Longstone,[117] 1¹⁄₂ miles\r\nto the N.E., is a monolith 10 feet high on the western side of a hill;\r\nit is visible from the circle though furze has grown round and partly\r\nhidden it.\r\n\r\nThe meanings of the various alignments seem to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                  Decl. N.       Star.        Date.\r\n  1. Apex of Carn                42° 33′  0″   Arcturus      2330 B.C.\r\n  2. Barrow 800′ distant         40  29   0       „          1970  „\r\n  3.

Stone                        9  15   0    Pleiades      1270 B.C.\r\n\r\nRegarding the possible solstitial alignments, the declinations obtained\r\nmay be neglected until the azimuths and angular heights of the hills\r\nhave been determined with a good theodolite. A change of -10′ in the\r\nangular elevation, and hence about that in the resulting declination,\r\nwould bring the date given by the barrows to about 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Longstone is well worthy of attention. Several very\r\nfine monuments which mark the surrounding horizon are visible from it in\r\nazimuths with which other monuments have made us familiar. They are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n            Alignment.                        Az.        Hills.\r\n  Longstone to Mên-an-tol                N. 50° 30′ E.   0° 34′\r\n        „      Nine Maidens (Boskednan)  N. 54   0  E.   1   0\r\n        „      W. Lanyon Quoit           N. 67   0  E.   0   0\r\n        „      Lanyon Quoit              N. 72  45  E.   0   0\r\n\r\nThese values, of which the angular heights of the hills were determined\r\napproximately from the contours on the 1-inch Ordnance map, lead us to\r\nthe following declinations:--\r\n\r\n            Alignment.             Decl.         Star.        Date.\r\n  Longstone to Mên-an-tol        24° 7′ N.  Solstitial sun.\r\n        „      Nine Maidens      22 37  N.       „\r\n               (Boskednan)\r\n        „      W. Lanyon Quoit   14  3  N.  May sun.\r\n        „      Lanyon Quoit      10 30  N.  Pleiades         1030 B.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Photograph of Ordnance Map, showing\r\nsight-lines.]\r\n\r\nThe May-sun alignment, it may be noted, differs from that from the\r\ncircle. The heights of hills when determined may give us the same solar\r\ndeclination; that now used gives the declination for April 28 and August\r\n15 in our present calendar.\r\n\r\nRegarding the alignment on Lanyon Quoit, it need only be pointed out\r\nthat the Pleiades date obtained is some 200 years after the date\r\nobtained for the analagous alignment from the circle, showing that if\r\nthese two monuments--the Tregaseal circle and the Longstone--have any\r\nrelationship, the removal to the high plain, now known as Woon Gumpus\r\nand Boswen Commons, was an afterthought improvement.\r\n\r\nI next come to the holed stones, not only the nest of them not far from\r\nthe circle, but the famous Mên-an-tol itself.\r\n\r\nI had heard before going to Tregaseal that the four holed stones shown\r\non the Ordnance map had been knocked down and set up again (not\r\nnecessarily in their old places) two or three times. Mr. Horton Bolitho\r\nand Mr. Thomas, however, in their examination were convinced that the\r\nlargest of them has never been moved. They also express the belief that\r\nthe others are not more than a foot or so from their original positions,\r\nand that this change is only due to their re-erection by Mr. Cornish\r\nafter they had fallen down. So far I have heard nothing of the direction\r\nof the hole in the stone which retains its original position.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting matter is that the explorers in question were able\r\nto trace an ancient stone alignment from the circle to the holed\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nI have long held that these holed stones were arrangements for\r\ndetermining an alignment. The famous Odin stone at Stenness, long since\r\ndisappeared, was, if we may trust the very definite statements made\r\nabout its position, used to observe the Barnstone in one direction and\r\nthe chief circle in the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Plan of the Mên-an-tol from Lukis, showing that\r\nit was an apparatus for observing the sunrise in May and August in one\r\ndirection and the sunset in February and November in the other. Sun’s\r\ndeclination, 16° N. or S.]\r\n\r\nThe azimuths suggest that theodolite measures may show that the\r\nTregaseal stones might have been used in the same way; they, the\r\nLongstone and Lanyon Quoit, are in nearly the same straight line, the\r\nalignment, holed stones to Longstone and Lanyon Quoit, being N. 67° E.,\r\nso that the May sunrise may have been noted in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo. by Lady Lockyer._\r\n\r\nFIG. 57.--The Mên-an-tol.]\r\n\r\nSeveral other monuments, _e.g._, Chûn Castle and Cromlech, are to be\r\nfound in the immediate neighbourhood of the Tregaseal circle and the\r\nLongstone, but these will have to await further investigation as to\r\ntheir character and antiquity before any conclusions concerning their\r\nastronomical use can be deduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--The Mên-an-tol. Front view and section, from\r\nLukis.\r\n\r\n~Front view: D. LOOKING S.W., SCALE 1 INCH TO 1 FOOT.~\r\n\r\n~Section: SECTION OF D.~]\r\n\r\nNot only do we find in this neighbourhood the nest of holed stones to\r\nwhich I have referred, but the Mên-an-tol, the most famous of them all,\r\nin England at all events. This, then, is the place to say a few words\r\nabout them. I have before stated my opinion that these stones, instead\r\nof being used as slaughter stones or posts at which to tie up the victim\r\nbefore sacrifice, or in any other similar employment, were really\r\nsighting stones to enable an alignment to be easily picked up. As such\r\nthese were, of course, treated as sacred, and hence the folk-lore\r\nconnected with them. This folk-lore seems to be most complete in the\r\ncase of the famous stone of Odin at Stenness, so I condense Mr. Spence’s\r\naccount of it.\r\n\r\nChildren brought to the stone at Beltaine and Midsummer, after being\r\ncarried sunwise round the holy well were passed through the hole as a\r\nprotection against the powers of the evil one. Marriage ceremony\r\nconsisted of joining hands through the hole, a vow held as sacred as\r\nthe legal marriage of to-day. Pains in the head cured by inserting the\r\nhead in the cavity, cure of palsy in children. Children and adults\r\ntravelled many miles to secure relief in this way.\r\n\r\nAt the Mên-an-tol the curative effects could only be obtained by\r\ncrawling through the aperture, which is of considerable size.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, the aperture is much more restricted. The general\r\nsize of the holed stone and the position of the aperture in it may be\r\nwell gathered from the fact that almost all of them have been used for\r\ngateposts, and are now to be seen fulfilling that function. In some\r\ncases the old special use can be inferred, but in others this is more\r\ndifficult, as the stones have been shifted or slewed round, or the\r\nancient monument to which the sighting stone was directed has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical origin of the Mên-an-tol, which obviously has never\r\nbeen disturbed, is quite obvious. Fig. 56 (from Lukis) shews that it was\r\narranged along the May year alignment, the advent of May and August,\r\nFebruary and November being indicated by the shadows cast by the stones\r\nthrough the aperture on to the opposite ones.\r\n\r\nTo the south-west the alignment for the February and November sunsets\r\npasses exactly over Chûn Castle.\r\n\r\nThe “Tolmen” near Gweek, Constantine, another famous holed stone 7 feet\r\n9 inches high and with an aperture of 17 inches, is according to a\r\nmagnetic bearing I took last Easter parallel to the Mên-an-tol, and\r\ndoubtless was used for the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[117] In Cornwall this is the name generally given to a monolith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nSOME OTHER CORNISH MONUMENTS\r\n\r\n_Boscawen-un_, _N. Lat._ 50° 5′ 20″\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife and I visited Boscawen-un on a pouring day, when it was\r\nimpossible to make any observations. Mr. Horton Bolitho, who was with\r\nus, introduced us to the tenant of Boscawen-noon--Mr. Hannibal Rowe--who\r\nvery kindly, in spite of the bad weather, took us to the circle and the\r\nstone cross to the N.E. of it.\r\n\r\nLukis thus described this monument:[118]--\r\n\r\n“The enclosed ground on which this circle stands is uncultivated and\r\nheathy, and slopes gently to the south. Twenty years ago a hedge ran\r\nacross it and bisected the circle.\r\n\r\n“This monument is composed of nineteen standing stones, and is of an\r\noval form, the longer diameter being 80 feet and the shorter 71 feet 6\r\ninches. One of the stones is a block of quartz 4 feet high, and the\r\nrest, which are of granite, vary from 2 feet 9 inches to 4 feet 7 inches\r\nin height. On the west side there is a gap, whence it is probable that\r\na stone has been removed. Within the area, 9 feet to the south-west from\r\nthe centre, is a tall monolith, 8 feet out of the ground, which inclines\r\nto the north-east, and is 3 feet 3 inches out of the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--Photograph of the Ordnance Map.]\r\n\r\n“In 1594 Camden describes this monument as consisting of nineteen\r\nstones, 12 feet from each other, with one much larger than the rest in\r\nthe centre. It must have been much in the same condition then as now. As\r\nhe does not say that the monolith enclosed within it was inclined, it is\r\npossible that it was upright at that time.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Stukeley’s supposition was that it originally stood upright, and\r\nthat ‘somebody digging by it to find treasure disturbed it.’\r\n\r\n“On the north-east side there are two fallen stones which Dr. Borlase,\r\nin 1749, imagined to have formed part of a Cromlech. It is more probable\r\nthat they are the fragments of a second pillar which was placed to the\r\nnorth-east of the centre, and as far from it as the existing one is.\r\nThere are instances, I believe, of two pillars occupying similar\r\npositions within a circle. One of the stones, that marked C in my plan,\r\non the eastern side of the ring, was prostrate in the Doctor’s time.\r\n\r\n“At a short distance to the south-east and south-west there are cairns,\r\nwhich have been explored.”\r\n\r\nFor this monument I have used the 6-inch map, as the circle lies nearly\r\nat the centre, and all the outstanding stones are within its limits. The\r\nheights of the sky-line were measured by Mr. H. Bolitho at a subsequent\r\nvisit with a miner’s dial; the resulting declinations have been\r\ncalculated by Mr. Rolston. A theodolite survey will doubtless revise\r\nsome of them:--\r\n\r\n          Marks.          Az.       Hills.    Dec.         Star.   Date.\r\n  1. F.

(DATE OF STONEHENGE), 48°\r\n40′-53° 40′.~]\r\n\r\nI gather from a report which Mr. H. Bolitho has been good enough to send\r\nme that modern hedges and farming operations have changed the conditions\r\nof the sight-lines, so that 1 and 3 are just invisible from the circle.\r\nThis is by no means the only case in which the sighting stone has just\r\nbeen hidden over the brow of a hill and in which signals from an\r\nobserver on the brow itself have been suggested, or a _via sacra_ to the\r\nbrow from the circle; there are many monoliths in this direction which\r\ncertainly never belonged to the circle.\r\n\r\nFrom the menhir P (No. 2) a fine view is obtained from N. to S. through\r\nE., so that the Blind Fiddler and the two large menhirs, and almost the\r\ncircle, are visible. The curious shapes of 1 and 2 are noted, the east\r\nface vertical and the west boundary curved, like several sighting stones\r\non Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nThe circle itself has several peculiarities. In the first place, as\r\nshown by Lukis, it is not circular, the diameters being about 85 and 65\r\nfeet; the minor axis runs through the pillar stone in the centre and the\r\n“fallen stones” of Dr. Borlase towards the “stone cross” (which is no\r\ncross but a fine menhir) in Az. N. 43° 15′ E. This would suggest that\r\nthis was the original alignment in 2250 B.C., but against this is the\r\nfact that the two stones of the circle between which the “fallen stones”\r\nlie are more carefully squared than the rest. It is true, however, that\r\nthis might have been done afterwards, and this seems probable, for they\r\nare closer together than the other circle stones.\r\n\r\nThe one quartz stone occupies an azimuth S. 66° W. It was obviously\r\nplaced in a post of honour. As a matter of fact, from it the May sun\r\nwas seen to rise over the centre of the circle.\r\n\r\nAs there are both at Tregaseal and Boscawen-un alignments suggesting the\r\nobservation of the summer solstice sunrise, it is desirable here to\r\nrefer to the azimuths as calculated. For this purpose Fig. 60 has been\r\nprepared, which shows these for lat. 50° both at the present day and at\r\nthe date of the restoration at Stonehenge.\r\n\r\nMy readers should compare this with Fig. 36, which gives the solstice\r\nsunrise conditions of Stenness in Lat. N. 59°. Such a comparison will\r\nshow how useless it is to pursue these inquiries without taking the\r\nlatitude and the height of the sky-line into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Stripple Stones_” (lat. 50° 32′ 50″ N., long. 4° 37′ W.)\r\n\r\nThis is a very remarkable circle consisting of 5 erect and 11 prostrate\r\nstones situated on a circular level platform 175 feet in diameter on the\r\nboggy south slope of Hawk’s Tor on the Hawkstor Downs in the parish of\r\nBlisland. The circle itself is about 148 feet in diameter, and the whole\r\nmonument is, in Lukis’s opinion, the most interesting and remarkable in\r\nthe country. Surrounding the platform is a ditch 11 feet wide, and\r\nbeyond that a penannular vallum about 10 feet in width. The peculiarity\r\nof the vallum is that it has three bastions situate on the north-east,\r\nnorth-west, and east sides. It is to the north-east bastion that I wish\r\nto refer.\r\n\r\nSighting from the huge monolith, which is now prostrate but originally\r\nmarked the centre of the circle, along a line bisecting the arc of this\r\nbastion we find that the azimuth of the sight-line is N. 25° E.; the\r\nangular elevation of the horizon from the 1-inch Ordnance map appears to\r\nbe about 0° 22′. From these values, proceeding as in the former cases,\r\nwe find\r\n\r\n                Alignment.                 Decl.     Star.     Date.\r\n  Centre of circle to centre of bastion  35° 1′ N.  Capella  1250 B.C.\r\n\r\nindicating that this alignment was formed for the same purpose as that\r\nwhich dominated the erection of the “Pipers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Nine Maidens_” (lat. 50° 28′ 20″ N., long. 4° 54′ 35″ W.)\r\n\r\nIn this monument we find a very different type from those considered\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nThe Nine Maidens are simply 9 stones in a straight line 262 feet in\r\nlength at the present day; possibly, as suggested by Lukis, it may have\r\nextended originally to the monolith known as “The Fiddler,” situated\r\nsome 800 yards away in a north-easterly direction. Measuring the azimuth\r\nof the alignment on Lukis’s plan, and finding the horizon elevations\r\nfrom the 1-inch Ordnance map, we have the following:--\r\n\r\n     Az.       Hills.     Decl.

Capella    1480 B.C.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that here we have a date for the use of Capella\r\nintermediate between those obtained for the “Pipers” and the “Strippie\r\nStones” respectively.\r\n\r\n[118] _Prehistoric Stone Monuments of the British Isles: Cornwall._ W.\r\nC. Lukis. P. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLOCK-STARS IN EGYPT AND BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now finished my astronomical reconnaissance of the British\r\nmonuments. I trust I have shown how important it is that my holiday task\r\nshould be followed by a serious inquiry by other workers so that the\r\napproximate values with which I have had to content myself for want of\r\ntime may be replaced by others to which the highest weight can be\r\nattached. This means at each circle reversed observations with a\r\nsix-inch theodolite and determination of azimuths by means of\r\nobservations of the sun if necessary.\r\n\r\nI propose in the present chapter to bring together the general results\r\nalready obtained in cases where the inquiry has been complete enough to\r\nwarrant definite conclusions to be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe first result to be gathered from the observations, and one to which\r\nI attach the highest importance, is that the practice, so long employed\r\nin Egypt, of determining time at night by the revolution of a star round\r\nthe pole, was almost universally followed in the British circles. This\r\npractice was to watch a first-magnitude star, which I named a\r\n“clock-star,”[119] of such a declination that it just dipped below the\r\nnorthern horizon so that it was visible for almost the whole of its\r\npath.\r\n\r\nDoubtless this same method of determining the flow of time during the\r\nnight watches was also employed in Babylonia,[120] but there, alas! the\r\ntemples, or, in other words, the astronomical observatories, have\r\ndisappeared, so that only the Egyptian practice remains for us to study.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Egypt._\r\n\r\nLet us, before we proceed, consider some results which have been\r\ngathered from the study of the Egyptian observations.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest temples in Egypt concerning which we have historical\r\nreferences to check the orientation results was built to carry on these\r\nnight observations at Denderah, lat. N. 26° 10′. The star observed was α\r\nUrsae Majoris, decl. N. 58° 52′, passing 5° below the northern horizon;\r\ndate (assuming horizon 1° high) about 4950 B.C., _i.e._, in the times of\r\nthe Shemsu Heru, before Mena, as is distinctly stated in the\r\ninscriptions.\r\n\r\nAfter α Ursae Majoris had become circumpolar in the latitude of\r\nDenderah, γ Draconis, which had ceased to be circumpolar, and so\r\nfulfilled the conditions to which I have referred, replaced it. Its\r\ndeclination was 58° 52′ N. about 3100 B.C., and it, therefore, could\r\nhave been watched rising in the axis prolonged of the old temple in the\r\ntime of Pepi, who restored it then, no doubt on account of the advent\r\nof the new star, and is stated to have deposited a copy of the old plan\r\nin a cavity in the new walls.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have two dates given by orientation of a clock-star\r\ntemple entirely agreeing with the most recent views of Egyptian\r\nchronology.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Budge’s _History of Egypt_ (iii. 14) the story of the rebuilding\r\nof the temple at Annu by Usertsen (2433 B.C., Brugsch) is given from an\r\nancient roll. Supposing this temple built parallel with the faces of the\r\nremaining obelisk, γ Draconis would rise in its axis prolonged 2500\r\nB.C., proving that Usertsen did at Annu what Pepi previously did at\r\nDenderah, and that the same reason for restoration and even the same\r\nstar were in question.[121]\r\n\r\nWhen the clock-star ceased to be visible in the chief temple other\r\nsubsidiary temples were subsequently built to watch it. Thus γ Draconis\r\nwas watched at Thebes from 3500 B.C. to the times of the Ptolemys by\r\ntemples oriented successively from that of Mut Az. N. 72° 30′ E. to 68°\r\n30′, 63° 30′, and 62°.[122]\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to show that what we know now of the Egyptian methods\r\nof observation enables us to carry the matter further, while we gather\r\nat the same time that in consequence of the difference of latitude the\r\nmethod employed in Egypt could not be followed in Britain.\r\n\r\nI showed in the _Dawn of Astronomy_ that several ancient shrines\r\nconsisted of two temples at right angles to each other (see Fig. 13),\r\none axis pointing high N.E. to observe the clock-star--the worship of\r\nSet--the other low N.W. to observe either the sun by itself, or in\r\nassociation with some important star of the same declination as the sun.\r\n\r\nThe temples of Mut and Menu (or Min), and of Amen, with the associated\r\ntemple M. of Lepsius, at Karnak, are the best extant examples of this\r\nprinciple of temple building.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that both at Annu and Memphis the same principle was\r\nfollowed, but at Annu one obelisk alone remains, and at Memphis one\r\ntemple; from these, however, Captain Lyons and myself have obtained\r\nsufficient data to enable the original directions of the temple-systems\r\nto be gathered.\r\n\r\nAt Denderah, if such a N.W. temple ever existed it has disappeared, but\r\nas the monument stands there are still two temples at right angles to\r\neach other, but the second one faces S.E. instead of N.W.\r\n\r\nThis premised, I will now give, in anticipation of another one dealing\r\nwith the British monuments, a list of the most ancient star temples in\r\nEgypt, with their azimuths and the first-magnitude clock-stars which\r\ncould have been observed in them at different dates. These dates have\r\nbeen approximately determined by the use of a precessional globe, an\r\nhorizon of 1° elevation being assumed. As I have shown, the present\r\nviews of Egyptian chronology and the inscriptions carry us back to α\r\nUrsae Majoris, at Denderah. But there is a suggestion at Luxor, and\r\nperhaps also at Abydos, that Vega was used before that star, though\r\nthere are, so far as I know, no temple traces of Arcturus.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-------+------+-------+-----+------+--------+---------\r\n      Temple.   |N.

In the latter case no date can be given unless we have reason to\r\nbelieve that both the sun _and_ a star rose or set at the same point of\r\nthe horizon at the same date; in other words, the sun and star had the\r\nsame declination, and the rising or setting of both could be seen in the\r\nsame temple.\r\n\r\nI assumed, without historical data, that this view was acted on in\r\nEgypt, at the temple of Menu; Mr. Penrose found, with historical data,\r\nthat it was actually acted on in Greece at the Parthenon. To show that\r\nwe are at all justified in this view we must study the association of\r\ngods with temple worship, and look for temples in different azimuths\r\nerected at different times if the god is a star; and we can run the star\r\nhome if the dates fall in with the star’s precessional change. Thus\r\nthere is reason for supposing that the god Ptah and the star Capella\r\nwere associated. There is a temple of Ptah at Memphis, Az. N. 77° 15′\r\nW., hills 50′, decl. N. 11°, star Capella, date 5200. In the rectangular\r\nsystem at Memphis, then, α Ursae Majoris was watched in one temple and\r\nCapella in the other at that date. There is also evidence that the god\r\nMenu was associated with the star Spica. In the temple system of Mut at\r\nThebes, in 3200 B.C., γ Draconis was used as a clock-star in one temple,\r\nwhile the setting of Spica was watched in the other.\r\n\r\nIf a temple is erected to the sun with no specially named cult, it may\r\nbe a sun-temple pure and simple, not connected with star worship because\r\nthere was no star with the proper declination at the time.\r\n\r\nIn Greece temple-building was carried on at a much later time, so late\r\nthat perhaps water clocks were available, so that we should not expect\r\nto find many clock-star temples in that country. As a matter of fact\r\nthere is only one, of which the data, according to Mr. Penrose, are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                  N. Decl.     Star.    Date.\r\n  Thebes, The City of the Dragon  +54° 28′  γ Draconis  1160\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the star used in Greece was the last clock-star\r\ntraced in the Egyptian temples.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Britain._\r\n\r\nI now come to Britain. So far as my inquiries have gone, these\r\nclock-star observations were introduced into these islands about 2300\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nIn my statement concerning them I will deal with the astronomical\r\nconditions for lat. 50° N., as it is in Cornwall that the evidence is\r\nmost plentiful and conclusive.\r\n\r\nIn that latitude and at that time Arcturus, decl. N. 41°, was just\r\ncircumpolar with a sea horizon, and therefore neither rose nor set.\r\nCapella, decl. N. 31°, when northing was 9° below the horizon, so that\r\nit rose and set in azimuths N. 37° E. and N. 37° W. respectively; it was\r\ntherefore invisible for a long time and was an awkward clock-star in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Arcturus and Capella as clock-stars in Britain.\r\n\r\n    AB = sea horizon.\r\n  A′B′ = horizon 3° high.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 61 represents diagrammatically the conditions named, the\r\ncircumpolar paths of Arcturus and Capella being shown by the smaller and\r\nlarger circle respectively. _A B_ represents the actual sea horizon and\r\n_A′ B′_ a locally raised horizon 3° high, whilst the dotted portion of\r\nthe larger circle represents the non-visible part of Capella’s apparent\r\npath.\r\n\r\nWhat the British astronomer-priests did, therefore, in the majority of\r\ncases was to set up their temples in a locality where the N.E. horizon\r\nwas high, so that Arcturus rose and set over it and was invisible for\r\nonly a short time, as shown in the diagram by the raised horizon _A′\r\nB′_.\r\n\r\nThe two lists following contain the names of the monuments where I\r\nsuggest Arcturus was used as a clock-star. In the first, the angular\r\nelevation of the sky-line as seen from the circle in each case has been\r\nactually measured, and the date of the alignment is, therefore, fairly\r\ntrustworthy; but in the second list the elevations have been estimated\r\nfrom the differences of contour shown on the one-inch Ordnance map, and\r\nthe dates must be accepted as open to future revision.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTURUS AS A CLOCK-STAR.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n  -------------+-------------------+---------------------------------+\r\n               |     Position.     |                                 |\r\n   Monument.   +---------+---------+            Alignment.           |\r\n               | Lat.

The\r\nintroduction of graduated circles permitted the employment of\r\ncircumpolar stars, and the “guards” of the Little Bear or the “pointers”\r\nof the Great Bear were thus used. There was a disc with a central\r\naperture through which the pole star could be observed; the disc could\r\nbe adjusted for every night in the year; an arm was then moved round so\r\nthat the direction of the pointers (or the guards) with regard to the\r\nvertical could be measured; on a second concentric circle the time of\r\nnight could be read off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--A “night-dial.”]\r\n\r\n[119] _Dawn of Astronomy_, 1894, p. 343.\r\n\r\n[120] Jensen, _Kosmologie der Babylonier_, p. 147.\r\n\r\n[121] _Dawn of Astronomy_, p. 215.\r\n\r\n[122] _Ibid._, p. 214.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nA SHORT HISTORY OF SUN TEMPLES\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Original Cult_\r\n\r\nI have given detailed evidence showing that the first circle builders in\r\nBritain worshipped the May-year sun, whether they brought it with them\r\nor not. This year was used in Babylon, Egypt, and afterwards in Greece.\r\nIn the two former countries May was the harvest month, and thus became\r\nthe chief month in the year. The dates were apt to vary with the local\r\nharvest time.\r\n\r\nThe earliest extant temple aligned to the sun at this festival seems to\r\nhave been that of Ptah at Memphis, 5200 B.C. I have already referred to\r\nthis temple in relation to the clock-star observations carried on in it.\r\n\r\nThis approximate date of the building of the temple is obtained by the\r\nevidence afforded (1) by the associated clock-star (see p. 298), and (2)\r\nby the fact that the god Ptah represented the star Capella, since there\r\nis a Ptah temple at Thebes aligned on Capella at a later time, when by\r\nthe processional movement it had been carried outside the solar limit.\r\nThere was also a similar temple at Annu (Heliopolis, lat. N. 30° 10′),\r\nbut it has disappeared. The light of the sun fell along the axis when\r\nthe sun had the declination N. 11°, the Gregorian dates being April 18\r\nand August 24.\r\n\r\nAnother May-year temple was that of Menu at Thebes, Az. N. 72° 30′ W.\r\n(lat. N. 25°; sun’s declination N. 15°; Gregorian date, May 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Layard’s plan of the Palace of Sennacherib\r\ndiscovered in the mound of Kouyunjik. The temple axis, XXXVI., XXXIV.,\r\nXXIX., XIX. (XXII. is on a lower level), faces the rising of the May\r\nsun.]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen (p. 299), Spica had this declination in 3200 B.C., and\r\nthe coincidence may have been the reason for the erection, or, more\r\nprobably, the restoration, of the temple,[123] especially as γ Draconis\r\ncame into play as a new clock-star at the same date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Layard’s plan of the Mound at Nimrood showing\r\nits equinoctial orientation.]\r\n\r\nThe researches of Mr. Penrose in Greece have provided us with temples\r\noriented to the May-year sun. I shall return to them afterwards, as they\r\nare later in time than the British monuments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The Temples at Chichen Itza.]\r\n\r\nThe explorations of Sir H. Layard at Nineveh, lat. 36° N., have shown\r\nthat the temple in Sennacherib’s palace, which may have been a\r\nrestoration of a much older temple, was also oriented to the May sun.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that our present-day archæologists do not more strictly\r\nfollow the fine example set by Sir Henry Layard in his explorations of\r\nKouyunjik. When he had unearthed Sennacherib’s palace (700 B.C.) he was\r\ncareful to give the astronomical and magnetic bearings of the buildings\r\nand of the temple which seemed to form the core of them. The bearing is\r\nAz. N. 68° 30′ E., giving the sun’s declination as N. 16°.\r\n\r\nI am enabled by the kindness of Mr. John Murray to give copies of the\r\nplans which Sir H. Layard prepared of the excavations both at Kouyunjik\r\nand Nimrood, showing the careful orientation which enables us to claim\r\nSennacherib’s temple as one consecrated to the May year, while at\r\nNimrood (Babylon) the equinoctial worship was in vogue as at the\r\npyramids.\r\n\r\nIn association with these plans of Layard’s, I give another by Mr.\r\nMaudslay of the as carefully oriented temples at Chichen Itza (N. lat.\r\n20°) explored by him. In these temples, of unknown date and origin, the\r\nazimuths of two show that the May year was worshipped.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The May-Year Monuments in Britain._\r\n\r\nIn the first glimpses of the May year in Egypt we have dates from 5000\r\nB.C. It does not follow that it did not reach Great Britain before about\r\n2000 B.C. because monuments made their appearance about that time. It is\r\nclear, also, that with the possibilities of coastwise traffic as we have\r\nfound it, it might as easily have reached Ireland by then; 2000 B.C.,\r\ntherefore, is a probable date for the May worship to have reached\r\nBritain arguing on general principles; we now come to a detailed summary\r\nof the facts showing that it really reached Britain earlier.\r\n\r\nAlignments in British monuments designed to mark the place of the sun’s\r\nrising or setting on the quarter-days of the May year have been found as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  -------------+----------------------+----------------+----------------\r\n               |       Position.      |  May and Aug.  |  Feb. and Nov.\r\n    Monument.  +----------+-----------+-------+--------+-------+--------\r\n               |  Lat.

This\r\npractice was fully employed in Britain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May Warnings._--The following table gives the stars I have so far noted\r\nwhich were used as warners for the May festival.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+------------+-------------\r\n                       |            |Date or dates\r\n       Monument.       |    Star.   |    B.C.\r\n                       |            |\r\n  ---------------------+------------+-------------\r\n  Stonehenge           |Pleiades (R)|    1950\r\n                       |            |\r\n  Merry Maidens        |Pleiades (R)|    1930\r\n                       |Antares  (S)|    1310\r\n                       |            |\r\n  The Hurlers          |Antares  (S)|    1720\r\n                       |Pleiades (R)|    1610\r\n  Merrivale            |Pleiades (R)|    1610\r\n                       |     „      |    1420\r\n                       |            |\r\n  Boscawen-un          |Pleiades (R)|    1480\r\n                       |            |\r\n  Tregaseal            |Pleiades (R)|    1270\r\n                       |            |\r\n  Stenness             |Pleiades (R)|    1230\r\n                       |            |\r\n  Longstone (Tregaseal)|Pleiades (R)|    1030\r\n  ---------------------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\n  (R) = rising.

The alignments and dates given in the Arcturus table\r\ntherefore hold good for August. At the Hurlers, where the hill over\r\nwhich Arcturus was observed fell away abruptly, we find Sirius\r\nsupplanting Arcturus as the warning star for August in 1690 B.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November warnings._--So far I have discovered no evidence that any star\r\nwas employed to herald the November sun. There may be two reasons for\r\nthis. In the first place the November festival “Halloween” took place at\r\nsun_set_ and the sun itself could be watched, no heralding star being\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the atmospheric conditions which prevail in Britain during\r\nNovember would not be conducive to the making of stellar observations\r\n_at the horizon_, and only risings or settings were observed with regard\r\nto the quarter-days.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February Warnings._--In the same way that Arcturus served the double\r\npurpose of clock-star and herald for the August sun, so did Capella\r\nserve to warn the February sun in addition to its use at night. The\r\nalignments and dates given in the Capella table will therefore hold good\r\nfor its employment at the February quarter-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Solstitial Year Monuments._\r\n\r\nIn Egypt generally, the solstitial worship followed that of the May and\r\nequinoctial years. The religion of Thothmes III. and the Rameses was in\r\ngreatest vogue 2200-1500 B.C.\r\n\r\nWe find little trace of it in Greece proper, though Mr. Penrose has\r\ntraced it in Calabria and Pompeii, and in some of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe solstitial cult was born in Egypt; it is a child of the Nile-rise. I\r\nhave shown in my _Dawn of Astronomy_ that the long series of temples\r\nconnected with the solstice may have commenced about 3000 B.C.; but for\r\nlong it was a secondary cult; it was parochial until the twelfth\r\ndynasty, say 2300 B.C. Egypt’s solstitial “golden age” may be given as\r\n1700 B.C., and her influence abroad was very great, so that much travel,\r\n“coastwise” and other, may be anticipated. It is for some centuries\r\nafter the first date that the introduction of the solstitial worship\r\ninto Britain may be anticipated. It, for instance, is quite probable\r\nthat the pioneers of this worship should have reached Stonehenge in 2000\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nThe solstitial alignments found by Mr. Penrose in Greece are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  +----------------+-----------------+--------+-------+-----\r\n  |Temples.        |                 | Decl.  |  Day. |Year.\r\n  +----------------+-----------------+--------+-------+-----\r\n  |                |                 |        |       |B.C.\r\n  |                |  JUNE.          |        |       |\r\n  |Athens, Dionysus|Antares (setting)|-11°  2′|June 20|1700\r\n  |(Upper Temple)  |                 |        |       |\r\n  |Pompeii (Isis)  |β-Geminorum      |-16  44 | „   19| 750\r\n  |                |                 |        |       |\r\n  |                | DECEMBER.       |        |       |\r\n  |Metapontum      |β-Geminorum      |+29° 38′|Dec. 21| 610\r\n  |                |  (setting)      |        |       |\r\n  |Locri           |     „           |+29  40 | „   21| 610\r\n  +----------------+-----------------+--------+-------+-----\r\n\r\nWe find plentiful evidence that the worship of the solstitial sun such\r\nas was carried on in Egypt at Karnak and at other places[125] was\r\nintroduced into Britain some time after the May-year worship was\r\nprovided for in the monuments.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the alignments already discovered are in all\r\nprobability solstitial, the variation of the sun’s solstitial\r\ndeclination is so slow and takes place between such narrow limits that a\r\nmost careful determination of the actual azimuths and of the angular\r\nheights of the various horizons must be made before any definite\r\nconclusion as to dates can be arrived at. The necessity for this care is\r\nillustrated in the paper on Stonehenge[126] communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety by Mr. Penrose and myself in 1891, where, after taking the\r\ngreatest precautions, the resulting date was in doubt to the amount of\r\n200 years in either direction.\r\n\r\nSo far Stonehenge is the only temple at which these observations have\r\nbeen made, so that for the other alignments contained in the following\r\nlist no dates can yet be given.\r\n\r\n  -----------+---------------+--------------+------------+---------+----\r\n   Monument. |   Alignment.  |      Az.     |   Decl.    | Season. |Date\r\n             |               |              |  (provi-   |         |B.C.\r\n             |               |              |  sional).  |         |\r\n  -----------+---------------+--------------+------------+---------+----\r\n  Stonehenge |Direction of   |N.49°34′18″ E.|23°54′30″ N.|Summer(R)|1680\r\n             |avenue         |              |            |         |\r\n             |               |              |            |         |\r\n  Boscawen-  |Circ. to fine  |N.53 30  0  E.|22 58 13    |Summer(R)|\r\n  un         |menhir         |              |            |         |\r\n             |Circ. to Blind |N.54 30  0  E.|22 24 12    |   „     |\r\n             |Fiddler        |              |            |         |\r\n             |               |              |            |         |\r\n  Tregaseal  |Circ. to row of|N.53 20 25  E.|22 53 26    |Summer(R)|\r\n             |holed stones   |              |            |         |\r\n             |Circ. to two   |N.50  0  0  E.|24  7  0    |   „     |\r\n             |barrows  900′  |              |            |         |\r\n             |distant        |              |            |         |\r\n             |               |              |            |         |\r\n  Longstone  |Mèn-an-tol to  |S.50 30  0  W.|24 33  0  S.|Winter(S)|\r\n  (Tregaseal)|Longstone      |              |            |         |\r\n             |               |              |            |         |\r\n  The        |N. circ. to    |S.50 50  0  E.|24 17 20  S.|Winter(S)|\r\n  Hurlers    |S.E. stone     |              |            |         |\r\n             |               |              |            |         |\r\n  Stanton    |Gt.

So far, however, I have not yet found any suggestion of\r\nits use elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAt Shovel Down and Challacombe on Dartmoor there are avenues pointing a\r\nfew degrees west of north. The sight-lines along these avenues would\r\nmark the setting-point of Arcturus at the time that that star (setting)\r\nwarned the rising of the sun at the summer solstice; but this use cannot\r\nbe considered as established, as Arcturus would scarcely set before its\r\nlight was drowned in that of the rising sun. The absence of darkness in\r\nhigh summer in these latitudes and the bad weather in the winter may\r\nboth be responsible for so few alignments for the solstices.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Equinoctial Year Monuments._\r\n\r\nThe equinoctial pyramid and Babylonian cult in vogue in Egypt in the\r\nearly dynasties (4000 B.C.), with the warning stars Aldebaran (March)\r\nand Vega (September), was represented in Greece at a much later period.\r\nThe facts for Greece, according to Mr. Penrose, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------+---------------+------+--------+-----\r\n  |                           |               | Decl.|  Day.  |Year.\r\n  +---------------------------+---------------+------+--------+-----\r\n  |                           |               |      |        |B.C.\r\n  |                           |MARCH.         |      |        |\r\n  |                           |               |      |        |\r\n  |Nike Apteros               |Spica (setting)|+6°10′|Mar.  17|1130\r\n  |Juno Lacinia (near Croton) |α-Arietis      |+7 27 | „    28|1000\r\n  |Paestum (Neptune)          |Spica (setting)|+3  5 | „    22| 535\r\n  |Gergenti (Hercules)        |      „        |+2 30 | „    30| 470\r\n  |                           |               |      |        |\r\n  |                           |SEPTEMBER.     |      |        |\r\n  |                           |               |      |        |\r\n  |Rhamnus (Themis)           |Spica (rising) |+6° 0′|Sept. 17|1092\r\n  |Tegea (Minerva)            |  „      „     |+5 51 |  „   18|1075\r\n  |Syracuse (?

This something, we have learned, might be another\r\ncircle, a standing stone, a dolmen, a cove, or a holed stone.\r\n\r\nA study of the sight-lines shows us that these collimation marks, as we\r\nmay call them, were of set purpose, generally placed some distance away\r\nfrom the circles, so far that they would require to be illuminated in\r\nsome way for the night and dawn observations. When there was no wind,\r\none or more hollows in a stone, whether a menhir or a quoit, might have\r\nheld grease to feed a wick or a pine-wood torch. But in a wind some\r\nshelter would be necessary, and the light might have been used in a\r\ncromlech or allée couverte. Stones have been found with such cups, and\r\ndébris of fires have been found in cromlechs.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that here there was no oil as in the Semitic\r\ncountries whence, as we have seen, the immigrants came; and it was not a\r\nquestion of a light on the sight-line alone. If wood were used, it must\r\nhave been kept dry for use, and whether wood or animal fat were employed\r\nthe most practical and convenient way of lighting up would have been to\r\nkeep a fire ever burning in some sheltered place.\r\n\r\n(2) Dwellings, which would be cromlechs or many-chambered barrows,\r\naccording to the number of astronomer-priests at the station. These\r\ndwellings would require to be protected against the invasions of the\r\nlocal fauna, very different from what it is now, and for this a small,\r\nand on that account easily blocked, entrance would be an essential.\r\n\r\nThese dwellings would naturally suggest themselves as the shelter place\r\nfor the ever-burning fire or the supply of dry wood. Tradition points\r\nwith no uncertain sound to the former existence of life and light in\r\nthese “hollow hills.” Mr. MacRitchie’s book[127] contains a mine of most\r\nvaluable and interesting information on this subject.\r\n\r\n(3) A water supply for drinking and bathing, which might be a spring,\r\nriver or lake, according to the locality.\r\n\r\nGiven a supply of food we have now provided for the shelter and\r\nprotection of the astronomer and the man.\r\n\r\nBut the man who brought this new astronomical knowledge was, before he\r\ncame, astrologer and magician as well, and, further, he was a priest;\r\nhence on account of his knowledge of the seasons, he could not only help\r\nthe aboriginal tiller of the soil as he had never been helped before, by\r\nhis knowledge; but he could appeal in the strongest way to his\r\nsuperstitious fears and feelings, by his function as the chief\r\nsacrificer and guardian of the sacrificial altars and fires. Hence it\r\nwas that everything relating to the three different classes of things to\r\nwhich I have referred was regarded as very holy because they were\r\nclosely associated with the astronomer-priests, on whom the early\r\npeoples depended for guidance in all things, not only of economic, but\r\nof religious, medical and superstitious value.\r\n\r\nThe perforated stones were regarded as sacred, so that passing through\r\nthem was supposed to cure disease. Whether men and women, or children\r\nonly, passed through the hole depended upon its size. But a hole large\r\nenough for a head to be inserted was good for head complaints.\r\n\r\nThe wells, rivers, and lakes used by the priests were, as holy places,\r\nalso invested with curative properties, and offerings of garments\r\n(skins?), and pins to fasten them on, as well as bread and wine and\r\ncheese, were made at these places to the priests.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tree on which the garment was hung was either a rowan\r\nor a thorn shows that these offerings commenced as early as the\r\nMay-November worship.\r\n\r\nThe holed stones, besides being curative, were in long after years,\r\nwhen marriage had been instituted, used for the interchange of marriage\r\nvows by clasping hands through the opening.\r\n\r\nThe cups for the light would also be sacred objects; and many of them\r\nhave been since used for holy water.\r\n\r\nThe cursus at Stonehenge and the avenues on Dartmoor may be regarded as\r\nevidences that sacred processions formed part of the ceremonial on the\r\nholy days, but sacrifices and sacred ceremonials were not alone in\r\nquestion; many authors have told us that feasts, games and races were\r\nnot forgotten. This, so far as racing is concerned, is proved, I think,\r\nby the facts that the cursus at Stonehenge is 10,000 feet long and 350\r\nfeet broad, that it occupies a valley between two hills, thus permitting\r\nof the presence of thousands of spectators, and that our horses are\r\nstill decked in gaudy trappings on May Day.\r\n\r\nNor is this all. It is hard to understand some of the folklore and\r\ntradition unless we recognise that at a time before marriage was\r\ninstituted, at some of the sacred festivals the intercourse of the sexes\r\nwas permitted if not encouraged. This view is strengthened by the\r\nresearches of Westermarck[128] and Rhys.[129] Given such a practice, the\r\norigin of matriarchal customs and of the _couvade_ is at once explained;\r\nand it is clear that the charges against the Druids of special cruelty\r\nand impurity must be withdrawn. Their sacrifices and customs were those\r\ncommon to all priesthoods in the ancient world.\r\n\r\nI have shown that some circles used in the worship of the May year were\r\nin operation 2200 B.C., and that there was the introduction of a new\r\ncult about 1600 B.C., or shortly afterwards, in southern Britain, so\r\ndefinite that the changes in the chief orientation lines in the stone\r\ncircles can be traced.\r\n\r\nTo the worship of the sun in May, August, November and February was\r\nadded a solstitial worship in June and December.\r\n\r\nThe associated phenomena are that the May-November Balder and Beltaine\r\ncult made much of the rowan and may thorn. The June-December cult\r\nbrought the worship of the mistletoe.\r\n\r\nThe flowering of the rowan and thorntree in May, and their berries in\r\nearly November, made them the most appropriate and striking floral\r\naccompaniments of the May and November worships, and the same ideas\r\nwould point to a similar use of the mistletoe in June and December.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the June-December cult succeeded and largely replaced the\r\nMay-November one could hardly have been put in a cryptic and poetic\r\nstatement more happily than it appears in folklore: Balder was killed by\r\nmistletoe.\r\n\r\nThis change of cult may be due to the intrusion of a new tribe, but I am\r\ninclined to attribute it to a new view taken by the priests themselves\r\ndue to a greater knowledge, among it being the determination, in Egypt,\r\nof the true length of the year which could be observed by the recurrence\r\nof the solstices, and of the intervals between the festivals reckoned in\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHowever this may have been, all the old practices and superstitions\r\nwere retained, only the time of year at which they took place was\r\nchanged. As the change of cult was slow, in any one locality the\r\ncelebrations would be continued at _both_ times of the year, and for\r\nlong both sets of holidays were retained.\r\n\r\nSince I have shewn that the solstitial worship came last, traces of\r\nthis, as a rule, would be most obvious in places where it eventually\r\nprevailed over the cult of the May year. In such places the absence of\r\ntraces of the May festival would be no valid argument against its former\r\nprevalence. In other places, like Scotland, where the solstitial cult\r\nwas apparently introduced late and was never prevalent, we should expect\r\nstrong traces of the May worship, and, as a matter of fact, it is very\r\nevident in the folk lore and customs of Scotland; even the old May year\r\nquarter days are still maintained.\r\n\r\nBetween the years 2300 B.C. and 1600 B.C., whether we are dealing with\r\nthe same race of immigrants or not, we pass from unhewn to worked\r\nstones. The method of this working and its results have been admirably\r\nshown to us by Prof. Gowland’s explorations at Stonehenge.\r\n\r\nFrom the tables, given in Chap. XXVIII, it can be seen that, so far as\r\nthe present evidence goes, there was a pretty definite time--about 2300\r\nB.C.--of beginning the astronomical work at the chief monuments;\r\nCornwall came first, Dartmoor was next.\r\n\r\nAlmost as marked as the simultaneous beginning are the dates of ending\r\nthe observations, if we may judge of the time of ending by the fact that\r\nthe precessional changes in the star places were no longer marked by the\r\nmarking out of new sight lines.\r\n\r\nThe clock-star work was the first to go, about 1500 B.C. The May-warning\r\nstars followed pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that we have full evidence of astronomical activity of\r\nall kinds at the circles for a period of some 700 years.\r\n\r\nWhat prevented its continuance on the old lines? It may have been that\r\nthe invention of some other method of telling time by night had rendered\r\nthe old methods of observation, and therefore the apparatus to carry\r\nthem on, no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may have been that some new race, less\r\nastronomically inclined, had swept over the land.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to take the former view. It is quite certain that for the\r\nclock-stars other observations besides those on the horizon would soon\r\nhave suggested themselves for determining the lapse of time during the\r\nnight. The old, high, bleak, treeless moorlands might then in process of\r\ntime have been gradually forsaken, and life may have gone on in valleys\r\nand even in sheltered woods, except on the chief festivals. When this\r\nwas so astronomy and superstition would give way to politics and other\r\nnew human interests, and the priests would become in a wider sense the\r\nleaders and the teachers of the more highly organised community.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that in later days as at the commencement they were still\r\nahead in the knowledge of the time. “Hi terrae mundique magnitudinem et\r\nformam, motus coeli ac siderum, ac quod dii velunt sciere profitentur”\r\nis Pomponius Mela’s statement concerning them.[130] From 1500 B.C. to\r\nCæsar’s time is a long interval, and yet the astronomical skill of the\r\nso-called Druids, who beyond all question were the descendants of our\r\nastronomical-priests, was then a matter of common repute. Cæsar’s\r\naccount of the Druids in Gaul (_Bello Gallico_, vi. c. 13, 14, 15) is\r\nextremely interesting because it indicates, I think, that the Druid\r\nculture had not passed through Gaul and had therefore been waterborne to\r\nBritain, whither the Gauls therefore went to study it.[131]\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the non-use of the ancient stones, we may imagine\r\nthat the priests--of ever-increasing importance--no longer dwelt in\r\ntheir cromlechs, but, rather, occupied such buildings as those which\r\nremain at Chysoister, and from this date it is possible that burials may\r\nhave taken place in some of the mounds then given up as dwelling places.\r\nAs sacred places they were subsequently used for burials, as Westminster\r\nAbbey has been; but burials were not the object of their erection.[132]\r\nThis new habit may have started the practice of cist burial by later\r\npeople in barrows thrown up for that special purpose.\r\n\r\nI cannot close this Chapter without expressing my admiration of the\r\nlearning and acumen displayed by Dr. Borlase in his treatment of the\r\nsubject of the Druids in his _History of Cornwall_, published in 1769; I\r\nfind he has anticipated me in suggesting that the hollowed stones were\r\nused for fires. It is clear, now that the monuments have been dated,\r\nthat the astronomical knowledge referred to by Cæsar and Pomponius Mela\r\nwas no new importation; if, therefore, the present view of ethnologists\r\nthat the Celtic intrusion took place about 1000 B.C. is correct, it is\r\ncertain the Celts brought no higher intelligence with them than was\r\npossessed by those whom they found here; nor is this to be expected if,\r\nas the inquiry has suggested, the latter were the representatives of the\r\nhighest civilisation of the East with which possibly the former had\r\nnever been brought into contact.\r\n\r\n[127] _The Testimony of Tradition._\r\n\r\n[128] _History of Human Marriage_, Chapter II.\r\n\r\n[129] _Celtic Folklore_, ii., 654.\r\n\r\n[130] _Pomp.

DETAILS OF THE THEODOLITE OBSERVATIONS AT STONEHENGE\r\n\r\nThe instrument chiefly employed was a six-inch transit theodolite by\r\nCooke with verniers reading to 20″ in altitude and azimuth. Most of the\r\nobservations were made at two points very near the axis, which may be\r\ndesignated by _a_, _b_. Station _a_ was at a distance of 61 feet to the\r\nsouth-west of the centre of the temple, and _b_ 364 feet to the\r\nnorth-east. The distance from the centre of Stonehenge to Salisbury\r\nSpire being 41,981 feet, the calculated corrections for parallax at the\r\npoints of observation with reference to Salisbury Spire are:--\r\n\r\n  Station _a_  +  4′ 12″.\r\n     „    _b_  - 25′ 20″.\r\n\r\n(1) _Relative Azimuths._--Theodolite at station _a_--\r\n\r\n  Salisbury Spire                                             0°  0′  0″\r\n  N. side of opening in N.E. trilithon of the external ring 237  27  40\r\n  Tree in middle of clump on Sidbury Hill                   237  40  20\r\n  Highest point of Friar’s Heel                             239  47  25\r\n  S. side of opening in N.E. trilithon                      240  14  40\r\n  Middle      „          „      „                           238  51  10\r\n\r\n(2) _Absolute Azimuths._--All the azimuths were referred to that of\r\nSalisbury Spire, the azimuth of which was determined by observations of\r\nthe Sun and Polaris.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Observation of Sun_, _June 23, 1901_, 3.30-3.40 P.M.\r\n\r\n  Mean of observed altitudes of Sun   41° 26′ 35″\r\n  Refraction                  -1′ 4″}  0   0  58\r\n  Parallax                    +   6 }\r\n                                      -----------\r\n  True altitude of Sun’s centre       41  25  37\r\n\r\nLatitude = 51° 10′ 42″.

This result agrees well with the value of the\r\nazimuth communicated by the Ordnance Survey Office, namely, 9° 4′ 8″\r\nfrom the centre of the circle, which being corrected by +4′ 12″ for the\r\nposition of station _a_, is increased to 9° 8′ 20″.\r\n\r\nHence, from the point of observation _a_, 9° 8′ 20″ has been adopted as\r\nthe azimuth of Salisbury Spire.\r\n\r\nWe thus get the following absolute values of the principal azimuths from\r\nthe point _a_:\r\n\r\n  Highest point of Friar’s Heel         239°  47′  25″\r\n                                         -9    8   20\r\n                                        --------------\r\n                                        230   39    5\r\n                                 or N.   50   39    5 E.\r\n  Middle of opening in N.E. trilithon   238   51   10\r\n                                         -9    8   20\r\n                                        --------------\r\n                                        229   42   50\r\n                                 or N.   49   42   50 E.\r\n\r\nThe difference of 8¹⁄₂′ between this and the assumed axis 49° 34′ 18″ is\r\nso slight that considering the indirect method which has necessarily\r\nbeen employed in determining the axis of the temple from the position of\r\nthe leaning stone, and the want of verticality, parallelism and\r\nstraightness of the inner surfaces of the opening in the N.E. trilithon,\r\nwe are justified in adopting the azimuth of the avenue as that of the\r\ntemple.\r\n\r\nNext, with regard to the determination of the azimuth of the avenue as\r\nindicated by the line of pegs to which reference is made on p. 65. The\r\nsmall angle between the nearest pegs A and B (which are supposed to be\r\nparallel to the axis of the avenue), observed from station _a_, was\r\nmeasured, and the corresponding calculated correction was applied to the\r\nascertained true bearing of the more distant peg B.\r\n\r\nThus\r\n\r\n  True bearing of peg B =                238°  35′  0″\r\n  Calculated correction to peg A =         0   12   8\r\n                                         ------------\r\n  True bearing of line AB                238   47   8\r\n  Bearing of Salisbury Spire             189    8  20\r\n                                         ------------\r\n  True bearing of a line parallel to\r\n    the axis of near part of avenue    N. 49   38  48 E.\r\n\r\nThe mean of the three independent determinations by another observer was\r\n49° 39′ 6″.\r\n\r\nThe calculated bearing of the more distant part of the axis of the\r\navenue determined in the same manner by observations from station _b_ is\r\n49° 32′ 54″. The mean of the two, namely, 49° 35′ 51″, justifies the\r\nadoption of the value 49° 34′ 18″ as given by the Ordnance Survey for\r\nthe straight line from Stonehenge to Sidbury Hill.\r\n\r\n(3) _Observation of Sunrise._--On the morning of June 25, 1901, sunrise\r\nwas observed from station _a_, and a setting made as nearly as possible\r\non the middle of the visible segment as soon as could be done after the\r\nSun appeared.\r\n\r\nThe telescope was then set on the highest point of the Friar’s Heel, and\r\nthe latter was found to be 8′ 40″ south of the Sun.\r\n\r\n  Sun’s declination at time of observation                23° 25′  5″\r\n  Elevation of horizon at point of sunrise                 0  35  48\r\n  Assuming 2′ vertical of Sun to have been visible at\r\n  observation, we have apparent altitude of Sun’s upper\r\n  limb                                                     0  37  48\r\n      Refraction                            - 27′ 27″ }   -0  27  18\r\n      Parallax                              +  0   9  }\r\n                                                          -----------\r\n  True altitude of upper limb                              0  10  30\r\n  Sun’s semi-diameter                                      0  15  46\r\n                                                          -----------\r\n  True altitude of Sun’s centre                           -0   5  16\r\n\r\n  From this it results that the true azimuth of\r\n  the Sun at the time of observation                 = N. 50° 30′ 54″ E.\r\n\r\n  And since azimuth of Friar’s Heel                  =    50  39   5\r\n                                                          -----------\r\n  2′ of sunrise should be N. of Friar’s Heel               0   8  11\r\n  Observed difference of azimuth                     =     0   8  40\r\n                                                          -----------\r\n        Observed - calculated                        =     0   0  29\r\n\r\nThe observation thus agrees with calculation, if we suppose about 2′ of\r\nthe Sun’s limb to have been above the horizon when it was made, and\r\ntherefore substantially confirms the azimuth above given of the Friar’s\r\nHeel and generally the data adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HINTS ON MAKING, AND METHOD OF REDUCING, THE FIELD OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be found useful if I give here a few hints as to the\r\nprecautions which must be taken in making the field observations and an\r\nexample of their reduction to an astronomical basis.\r\n\r\nFor the _azimuths_ of the sight-lines the investigator of these\r\nmonuments cannot do better than use the 25-inch, or 6-inch, maps\r\npublished by the Ordnance Survey. Their accuracy is of a very high order\r\nand is not likely to be exceeded, even if approached, by any casual\r\nobserver having to make his own special arrangements for correct time\r\nbefore he can begin his surveying work.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, it may be found that the Survey has not included\r\nevery outstanding stone which may be found by an investigator on making\r\na careful search; many of the stones are covered by gorse, &c., and are\r\nnot, therefore, easily found.\r\n\r\nIn such cases the azimuth of some object that is marked on the map\r\nshould be taken as a reference line and the difference of azimuth\r\nbetween that and the unmarked objects determined. By this means the\r\nazimuths of all the sight-lines may be obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen using the 25-inch maps for determining azimuths it must be borne in\r\nmind that the side-lines are not, necessarily, due north and south. The\r\nDirector-General of the Ordnance Survey, Southampton, will probably on\r\napplication state the correction to be applied to the azimuths on this\r\naccount, and this should be applied, of course, to each of the values\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason it is found necessary or desirable to make\r\nobservations of the azimuths independently of the Ordnance Survey, full\r\ninstructions as to the method of procedure may be found in an\r\ninexpensive instruction book[133] issued by the Board of Education. The\r\ninstructions given on p. 49, § 3, are most generally applicable, and\r\nthe form on p. 76 will be found very handy for recording and reducing\r\nthe observations.\r\n\r\nIn making observations of the angular elevation of the horizon a good\r\ntheodolite is essential. Both verniers should be read, the mean taken,\r\nand then the telescope should be reversed in its Ys, reset, and both\r\nreadings taken again. One setting and reading are of little use.\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance Survey maps may also be employed _in a preliminary\r\nreconnaissance_ to obtain approximate values of the horizon elevations.\r\nThis may be done by measuring the distances and contour-lines shown on\r\nthe one-inch maps. This method, however, is only very roughly\r\napproximate owing to the fact that sharp but very local elevations close\r\nto the monuments may not appear on these maps and yet be of sufficient\r\nmagnitude to cause large errors in the results.\r\n\r\nWhere trees, houses, &c., top the horizon, they should, of course, be\r\nneglected and the elevation of the ground level, at that spot, taken.\r\nShould the top of the azimuth mark (stone, &c.) show above the actual\r\nhorizon, its elevation should be recorded and not that of the horizon.\r\n\r\nHaving measured the angular elevation of the horizon along the\r\nsight-line, it is necessary to convert this into actual zenith distance\r\nand to apply the refraction correction before the computations of\r\ndeclination can be made.\r\n\r\nThe process of doing this and of calculating the declination will be\r\ngathered from the examples given below:--\r\n\r\n  _Data._\r\n\r\n  Monument:--E. circle Tregeseal, lat. 50° 8′ N. _i.e._ colat = 39° 52′.\r\n\r\n  Alignment. Centre of circle to Longstone.\r\n\r\n  Az. (from 25″ Ordnance Map). N. 66° 38′ E.\r\n\r\n  Elevation of horizon (measured) 2° 10′.\r\n\r\nReference to the May-Sun curve, given on p. 263, indicates that this is\r\nprobably an alignment to the sunrise on May morning. Therefore, in\r\ndetermining the zenith distance, the correction for the sun’s\r\nsemi-diameter (16′) must be taken into account, allowing that 2′ of the\r\nsun’s disc was above the horizon when the observation was made.\r\n\r\n_Zenith Distance_:--\r\n\r\n  Zenith distance of true  horizon                = 90°\r\n    „       „        local    „    = 90° - 2° 10′ = 87° 50′\r\n\r\nBessel’s tables show that refraction, at altitude 2° 10′, raises sun\r\n17′. If 2′ of sun’s limb is above horizon, sun’s centre is 14′ below.\r\n\r\n∴ True zenith distance of sun’s centre = 87° 50′ + 17′ + 14′ = 88° 21′.\r\n\r\n_Declination_:--\r\n\r\nHaving obtained the zenith distance, and the azimuth, the latitude being\r\nknown, the N.P.D. (North Polar Distance) of the sun may be found by the\r\nfollowing equations:--\r\n\r\n  (1) tan θ = tan _z_. cos A,\r\n\r\nwhere θ is the subsidiary angle which must be determined for the purpose\r\nof computation, _z_ is the true zenith distance, and A is the distance\r\nfrom the _North_ point.\r\n\r\n              cos _z_. cos (c - θ)[134]\r\n  (2) cos Δ = -------------------------,\r\n                       cos θ\r\n\r\nwhere Δ is the N.P.D. of the celestial object, and _c_ is the colatitude\r\n(90° - lat.) of the place of observation.\r\n\r\nIn the example taken this gives us--\r\n\r\n  (1) tan θ = tan 88° 21′. cos 66° 38′\r\n          θ = 85° 50′ 45″\r\n\r\n              cos 88° 21′. cos (39° 52′ - 85° 50′ 45″)\r\n  (2) cos Δ = ----------------------------------------\r\n                         cos 85° 50′ 45″\r\n\r\n          Δ = 73° 57′ 50″\r\n\r\n  Declination, δ, = (90° - Δ) = 16° 2′ 10″ N.\r\n\r\nReference to the Nautical Almanac shows that this is the sun’s\r\ndeclination on May 5 and August 9. We may therefore conclude that the\r\nLong-stone was erected to mark the May sunrise, as seen from the\r\nTregeseal Circle.\r\n\r\nHad we been dealing with a star, instead of the sun, the only\r\nmodification necessary in the process of calculating the declination\r\nwould have been to omit the semi-diameter correction of 14′.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a declination, we must refer to the curves given on pp.\r\n115-6 in order to see if there is any star which fits it, and to find\r\nthe date.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, the case of the apex of Carn Kenidjack, as seen from\r\nthe Tregeseal circle--\r\n\r\nAz. = N. 12° 8′ E.; hill = 4° 0.′ lat. = 50° 8′.\r\n\r\nThis gives us a declination of 42° 33′ N., and a reference to the\r\nstellar-declination curves (p. 115-6) shows that Arcturus had that\r\ndeclination in 2330 B.C. From the table given on p. 117, we see that at\r\nthat epoch Arcturus acted as warning-star for the August sun.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the elevation of the horizon is 30′, or in preliminary\r\nexaminations, where it may be assumed as 30′, the refraction exactly\r\ncounterbalances the hill, and therefore the true zenith distance at the\r\nmoment of star-rise is 90°. Hence the N.P.D. of the star may be found\r\nfrom the following simple equation--\r\n\r\n  (3) cos Δ = cos A cos λ\r\n\r\nwhere Δ and A have the same significance as before and λ is the\r\n_latitude_ of the place of observation.\r\n\r\n[133] _Demonstrations and Practical Work in Astronomical Physics at the\r\nRoyal College of Science, South Kensington._ Wyman and Sons, 1_s._\r\n\r\n[134] cos (c - θ) = cos -(c - θ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  =Abydos=, clock star at, 297.\r\n\r\n  =Africa=, sacred stones and trees, 235.\r\n\r\n  =Aldebaran=, _see_ Tauri α.\r\n\r\n  “=Allée couverte=,” 41, 317.\r\n\r\n  “=All Hallows=,” 187;\r\n    Irish and Welsh equivalents, 195.\r\n\r\n  “=All Souls=,” change of date, 186.\r\n\r\n  =Alsia well=, 227.\r\n\r\n  =Altar stone=, Stonehenge, 81;\r\n    Aberdeen type, 36.\r\n\r\n  =Amen-Rā=, 2;\r\n    temple of, 55, 297.\r\n\r\n  =Amplitude=, 10, 111.\r\n\r\n  =Animals=, sacrifices of, 197.\r\n\r\n  =Annu=, temples at, 296, 297, 304.\r\n\r\n  =Antares=, _see_ Scorpionis α.\r\n\r\n  =Antiquaries=, Society of, 69, 133.\r\n\r\n  =Antrobus=, Sir Edward, 49, 69, 94.\r\n\r\n  =Apollo=, 52.\r\n\r\n  =Arabia=, sacred stones and trees in, 235.\r\n\r\n  =Archæology=, relation to astronomy, 4.\r\n\r\n  =Arcturus=, _see_ Boötis α.\r\n\r\n  =Aries=, 15, 315.\r\n\r\n  =Armenia=, calendar in, 29;\r\n    fire festival in, 191.\r\n\r\n  =Aryans=, 40, 236.\r\n\r\n  =Ascension Day=, 185, 231.\r\n\r\n  _Asherah_, 245, 257.\r\n\r\n  =Ash Wednesday=, 182.\r\n\r\n  =Assacombe=, 158.\r\n\r\n  =Assyria=, sacred trees, &c., 245.\r\n\r\n  =Astronomer-priests=, procedure of, 110, 316.\r\n\r\n  =Athens=, May-day worship, 108;\r\n    temples at, 32;\r\n    warning stars at, 311.\r\n\r\n  =August-festival=, dates of, 185;\r\n    in Brittany, 199;\r\n    in Ireland and Wales, 186;\r\n    warning-stars, 311.\r\n\r\n  =Aurigae= α (=Capella=), clock- and warning-star, 117, 272, 290, 292,\r\n  293, 298, 299, 304, 312;\r\n    associated with Ptah, 304.\r\n\r\n  =Avebury=, cove at, 37.\r\n\r\n  =Avenue=, at Stonehenge, 63, 65.\r\n\r\n  =Avenues=, in Brittany, 149;\r\n    on Dartmoor, 146, 319;\r\n    definition of, 37.\r\n\r\n  =Axis= (=of temple=), Stonehenge, 55, 60;\r\n    Karnak, 56;\r\n    Kouyunjik, 305;\r\n    Annu, 305;\r\n    change of, 42.\r\n\r\n  =Azimuth=, defined, 10, 111;\r\n    changes in, 122;\r\n    of May sunrise, 264.\r\n\r\n  =Azimuth-marks=, illumination of, 110.\r\n\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n  =Baal=, 197, 249, 259.\r\n\r\n  “=Baal’s Fire=” (=Beltan=), 40.\r\n\r\n  =Babylon=, 24, 240, 259, 295, 308;\r\n    May year in, 304.\r\n\r\n  =Babylonians=, astronomical knowledge of, 240;\r\n    early navigators, 241.\r\n\r\n  =Baker=, Sir Samuel, 235.\r\n\r\n  =Balder=, 320.\r\n\r\n  =Balfour=, Prof. Bayley, 201.\r\n\r\n  =Ball=, Dr. Henry, 26.\r\n\r\n  =Balus=, first king of Orkney, 259.\r\n\r\n  =Baring-Gould=, Rev.

CLAY AND SONS, LTD., BREAD STREET HILL, E.C., AND BUNGAY, SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inconsistent, archaic and unusual spelling, hyphenation and\r\n  capitalisation have been retained, except as mentioned below. This\r\n  includes proper and geographical names.\r\n\r\n  Depending on the hard- and software used, not all elements may display\r\n  as intended. Some tables are best viewed in a wide browser window.\r\n\r\n  Index: the occasional error in the order of entries has not been\r\n  corrected.\r\n\r\n  For the illustrated versions: Where the quality of the illustration in\r\n  the source document permits and where the visibility of details in or\r\n  the legibility of the illustration requires, larger versions of\r\n  illustrations have been provided. Availability of these larger\r\n  illustrations depends on the version used.\r\n\r\n  Page 100, Fig. 27, Menhir (A): the reference letter is missing from\r\n  the illustration.\r\n\r\n  Page 101, Carnac-Leomariaquer: probably Carnac-Locmariaquer (as on\r\n  Page 38).\r\n\r\n  Footnote [124], table Chichen Itza, last line: the E. or W. is missing\r\n  in the source document.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Changes made\r\n\r\n  Illustrations and tables have been moved out of text paragraphs;\r\n  footnotes were moved to the end of the chapter. Some tables have been\r\n  re-arranged. Ditto marks have occasionally been replaced with the\r\n  dittoed text.\r\n\r\n  Some obvious minor typographical and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected silently; some minor formatting inconsistencies have been\r\n  standardised silently. Some Greek accents and diacritics have been\r\n  ignored.\r\n\r\n  Page 29: closing bracket inserted after 185-6 days respectively\r\n\r\n  Page 90, Fig. 24: reference letters A, B, C and D inside the\r\n  illustration have been enlarged for better visibility.\r\n\r\n  Page 97: alignments changed to alignements; aujourdhui changed to\r\n  aujourd’hui\r\n\r\n  Page 173, first table: 19° 51′ E. changed to N. 19° 51′ E.\r\n\r\n  Page 220: footnote marker [65] inserted after Rhys where it seems to\r\n  fit best (lacking in source document).",
