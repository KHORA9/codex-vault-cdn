N. McBryde, senior bacteriologist in the\r\nBiochemic Division of this Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe souring of hams is a source of considerable loss in the\r\nmeat-packing industry, and the cause of this trouble has heretofore\r\nbeen in doubt. Dr. McBryde’s paper presents the results of an\r\nexhaustive study of the subject, from which it appears that he has\r\nsucceeded in discovering the true cause of the trouble. Besides a\r\ndescription of the experimental work the paper discusses methods of\r\npreventing the souring of hams and the proper disposal of those which\r\nhave become affected.\r\n\r\n    Respectfully,       A.

The subject has given\r\nrise to much speculation on the part of those engaged in the curing\r\nof meats, as to the cause of the trouble and how it may be remedied,\r\nand has received considerable attention in a practical way, but little\r\nseems to have been done in a scientific way toward determining the\r\ncause and nature of ham souring.\r\n\r\nIn a well-regulated meat-packing establishment the loss from ham\r\nsouring is usually figured at about one-tenth of 1 per cent of the\r\ntotal weight of hams cured. At first thought this would seem but a\r\nsmall loss, but when one reflects that in a single large packing\r\nestablishment some 3,000,000 hams are cured during the year, the loss,\r\nwhen figured out, is considerable. Taking 15 pounds as the average\r\nweight of a ham, 3,000,000 hams would represent 45,000,000 pounds of\r\nmeat. Figuring the loss from souring on the basis mentioned, the amount\r\nof meat condemned and destroyed during the year would be 45,000 pounds.\r\nAssuming that hams sell at an average wholesale price of 15 cents a\r\npound, the yearly loss for a single plant which cures 3,000,000 hams a\r\nyear would be nearly $7,000.\r\n\r\nWhile one-tenth of 1 per cent of the total weight of hams cured would\r\nrepresent the loss from souring in a well-regulated establishment,\r\nstatistics obtained through Government meat inspectors show that\r\n0.25 per cent would more nearly represent the loss for the entire\r\ncountry. During the fiscal year from July 1, 1908, to June 30, 1909,\r\nsome 670,000,000 pounds of hams were placed in cure in packing\r\nestablishments subject to Government inspection. Estimating the loss\r\nfrom souring at 0.25 per cent, the total amount of meat condemned\r\nand destroyed as sour would be 1,675,000 pounds. At 15 cents a pound\r\nthe total annual loss from ham souring in packing houses subject to\r\nGovernment inspection would figure up something over a quarter of a\r\nmillion of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe problem of ham souring, therefore, is quite an important one from a\r\npractical and financial standpoint; but aside from these considerations\r\nit is also a subject of considerable scientific interest, and in\r\nview of the fact that all sour meats are condemned under the Federal\r\nregulations governing meat inspection it has seemed fitting that this\r\nquestion should be made the subject of scientific investigation on the\r\npart of the Bureau which is charged with the administration of this\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\nThe investigation reported in this paper has been conducted chiefly\r\nalong bacteriological lines, and has been confined entirely to the wet\r\nmethod of curing hams, as this method is the one generally used in\r\nAmerican packing houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        METHOD OF CURING HAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make clear certain points in regard to the nature and\r\noccurrence of ham souring and to insure a better understanding of the\r\nexperiments which are to be described later, it would seem best to\r\nbegin with a brief outline of the method of curing hams as practiced in\r\nthe larger packing establishments of the country. This description is\r\nmerely a general outline of the method of preparing hams for cure and\r\nthe method of handling hams while in cure, and deals chiefly with those\r\npoints that bear on the question of souring.\r\n\r\nAfter the slaughtered animal has been cleaned, scraped, eviscerated,\r\nwashed, and split down the middle, the carcass is usually allowed to\r\nhang for an hour or so in a large room open to the outside air, known\r\nas the “hanging floor.” This is done with a view to getting rid of a\r\ncertain amount of the body heat before the carcass is run into the\r\nchill rooms, and effects a saving in refrigeration.\r\n\r\nThe carcasses are next run into “coolers” or chill rooms, and subjected\r\nto refrigeration with a view to ridding them entirely of their body\r\nheat. The coolers are large rooms fitted with brine pipes and capable\r\nof accommodating several hundred carcasses. The temperature of the\r\ncoolers when the carcasses are run in is about 32° F. When filled, the\r\ntemperature of the cooler rises to about 45° F., owing to the heat\r\ngiven off from the carcasses. The temperature is then gradually reduced\r\nto 28 or 30° F. Hog carcasses are left in the coolers as a rule for\r\nforty-eight hours, at the end of which time they are stiff and firm,\r\nbut not frozen. The temperature of the chill rooms is always carefully\r\nwatched, thermometer readings being made every few hours and duly\r\nrecorded. The temperature of the carcasses is always tested when they\r\nleave the chill room. In those plants provided with a hanging floor, a\r\ncertain number of the carcasses are also tested before they are sent to\r\nthe chill rooms in order to determine the amount of heat lost on the\r\nhanging floor.\r\n\r\nThe carcasses are tested by means of an especially constructed\r\nthermometer, known as a “ham thermometer,” which has a pointed metal\r\nprotector so that it can be thrust into the body of the ham. (See fig.\r\n4.) The ham has been rightly selected as the proper portion of the\r\ncarcass at which to take the temperature, as it constitutes the largest\r\nmass of muscular tissue in the carcass and holds the body heat longer\r\nthan any other portion. In taking the temperature, the thermometer\r\nis thrust deep into the body of the ham so that the point of the\r\nthermometer rests alongside or a little behind the upper portion of the\r\nfemur or middle bone, the latter being used as a guide in introducing\r\nthe thermometer. A certain number of the carcasses from each cooler\r\nare tested in this way as a check on the refrigeration. The inside\r\ntemperature of the hams when they leave the chill rooms should be about\r\n34° F.\r\n\r\nThe carcasses are next cut up and the hams trimmed for pickling. In\r\nsome houses the hams are given an additional chilling of 48 hours after\r\nthey are cut from the carcasses, but this is not done as a rule, nor\r\ndoes it seem to be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe hams are now sent to the pickling rooms, or “sweet pickle\r\ndepartment,” as this branch of the packing house is designated, and\r\nhere a certain number are again tested with a thermometer, as described\r\nabove. This test is carried out by the foreman in charge of the sweet\r\npickle department in order that he may satisfy himself that the\r\nhams are properly chilled before they go into the pickle and as an\r\nadditional check on the refrigeration.\r\n\r\nThe hams are now ready to be “pumped,” and this pumping, as will be\r\nshown later, constitutes an important step in a successful cure.\r\nPumping consists in forcing a strong brine solution containing\r\nsaltpeter into the muscular tissues of the ham, and is accomplished by\r\nmeans of a large, hollow, fenestrated needle connected by means of a\r\nrubber hose with a powerful hand pump. The needle is introduced along\r\nthe bone, the latter being used as a guide.\r\n\r\nIn all of the larger packing establishments two general methods of\r\ncuring hams are followed, the two methods being designated as the\r\n“fancy” or “mild cure” and the “regular cure,” the term “cure” being\r\nused to designate the curing period. Various trade names are given\r\nby the different packing establishments to the hams cured by these\r\nmethods. In the fancy cure the hams are pumped in the shank only,\r\nwhereas in the regular cure they are pumped in both body and shank.\r\nThe same pumping pickle is generally used for the two cures. It is a\r\nsignificant fact that the greater proportion of the “sours” are found\r\namong the fancy or mild cure hams. This point will be discussed farther\r\non in connection with some experiments to be described later.\r\n\r\nThe actual curing is usually carried out in large vats which hold about\r\n1,400 pounds of meat or some hundred hams. The hams are packed in the\r\nvats in layers and are entirely covered with the pickling solution or\r\nbrine. A certain proportion is always observed between the weight of\r\nthe meat and the amount of the solution. The pickling solution, or\r\n“pickle,” as it is termed, is a brine solution containing saltpeter\r\nand sugar. The composition of the pickle varies somewhat with the\r\ndifferent packing establishments. The fancy-cure hams are usually cured\r\nin a milder pickle, that is, one that contains less salt and saltpeter\r\nthan the pickle used in the regular cure, although in some packing\r\nestablishments the same curing pickle is used for the two cures, the\r\nonly difference being the additional pumping given the regular-cure\r\nhams. The pickling rooms, or “cellars,” as they are called, are held at\r\na temperature of 34° to 36° F., and the pickling solutions are always\r\nchilled to this temperature before being used.\r\n\r\nThe hams are allowed to remain in cure for about 60 days, and during\r\nthis time are “overhauled” several times. Overhauling consists in\r\nthrowing the hams from the vat in which they are packed into a\r\nneighboring empty vat, and then transferring the pickle to the new vat.\r\nThe pickle is not changed, and the same pickle follows the hams through\r\nthe entire curing process. The object in overhauling is to stir up the\r\npickle and expose fresh surfaces of the meat to its action.\r\n\r\nHams are also cured in tierces which hold about 300 pounds of meat.\r\nIn the tierce cure, the hams are packed in the tierces, the latter\r\nare then headed up, the pickling solution is next run in through the\r\nbunghole, so as to fill the tierce entirely, and a wooden stopper is\r\nfinally driven into the bunghole. The tierces are rolled back and forth\r\nacross the floor on dates corresponding to the dates of overhauling in\r\nthe vat cure. The object of the rolling is to stir up the pickle, and\r\nin this way it corresponds to overhauling in the vat cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DEFINITION OF SOURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the meat inspector, a sour ham is one which has a tainted or “off”\r\nodor, that is, any odor which deviates from the normal. The odor may be\r\nvery slight, so slight that at times only the trained meat inspector\r\ncan detect it. When slight, the odor is elusive and hard to define, but\r\nwhen pronounced it has a distinctly putrefactive quality. When not very\r\npronounced, the odor possesses, as a rule, a slightly sour quality,\r\nchemically speaking, and at times this sour quality may be quite\r\nmarked; hence the term “sour ham,” or “sour” has originated. In a badly\r\nsoured ham—using the term “sour” in the packing-house sense to denote\r\nany ham that is tainted—the odor loses this sour quality and becomes\r\ndistinctly putrefactive in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        CLASSIFICATION OF SOUR HAMS AND LOCATION OF SOUR AREAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSour hams are classed as “shank sours” and “body sours,” according to\r\nthe location of the souring, and these may be “light” or “heavy.” When\r\nthe souring is very pronounced, the ham is termed a “stinker.”\r\n\r\nSouring appears to start, as a rule, around the stifle joint\r\n(femorotibial articulation), and extends upward into the body of the\r\nham.\r\n\r\nIn quite a large proportion of the hams which are sour in the\r\nbody—probably from 40 to 50 per cent—the souring extends through to\r\nthe bone marrow of the femur or middle bone, and the sour odor is at\r\ntimes more pronounced in the bone marrow than in the meat. The odor\r\nof the bone marrow, when pronounced, is strongly suggestive of a\r\ndissecting-room odor, and is distinctly putrefactive in quality.\r\n\r\nIn the case of light body sours the sour odor is confined to a small\r\narea immediately around the bone, and may be so slight that it is\r\ndetected only with difficulty. In such hams the bone marrow is apt to\r\nbe sweet, and it is not until the souring becomes more extensive that\r\nthe bone marrow becomes involved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Cross section through body of ham, with sour\r\nareas indicated by shading and dotted lines.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the sour area in the body of a well-developed sour\r\nis shown in figure 1.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a well-developed body sour the sour area is more\r\npronounced near the bone, as represented in figure 1 by the shaded\r\narea, and may extend out into the body of the ham for a variable\r\ndistance, according to the degree of souring, as represented by the\r\ndotted lines, gradually fading off toward the margins, where it may be\r\nimperceptible or entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nIn the pronounced sours, termed “stinkers,” the odor pervades the\r\nentire ham, and is of a distinctly putrefactive quality.\r\n\r\nIn shank sours, the souring is more or less confined to the shank, or\r\nthe region about the tibio-femoral articulation, but may extend upward\r\ninto the lower portion of the body of the ham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    METHOD OF DETECTING SOUR HAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouring is detected and located by means of a pointed metal instrument\r\nknown as a “ham trier,” which resembles a long, slightly flattened ice\r\npick. The trier is thrust into the ham at different points along the\r\nbone, rapidly withdrawn, and the odor which clings to the metal noted.\r\nThe trained inspector works very rapidly, and is able to detect even\r\nthe slightest sour or off odor which might be imperceptible to one not\r\ntrained to the work. At the end of the cure all hams are tested with\r\nthe trier under the supervision of Government meat inspectors.\r\n\r\nHams are also given what is called the “30-day inspection” by plant\r\ninspectors during the process of curing. An average ham weighing\r\nfrom 14 to 16 pounds requires about 60 days to cure, and at the end\r\nof 30 days a certain number of hams in each run are usually tested\r\nto see how the cure is progressing. If no sour hams are discovered\r\nat this inspection the packer knows that the cure is progressing\r\nsatisfactorily, and moreover he feels sure that his hams will finish\r\nsatisfactorily, for experience has taught him that souring develops\r\nwithin the first four weeks of the curing period, and if his hams are\r\nsweet at the end of this time, he can feel practically sure that no\r\nsours will develop later on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THEORIES IN REGARD TO HAM SOURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theories as to the cause of souring are many and varied. The\r\nmajority of them are pure speculation and have no foundation upon\r\nobserved facts. A few of these theories may be enumerated to show how\r\nwide and varied has been the speculation upon this subject.\r\n\r\nA theory which is quite prevalent among packing-house employees\r\nattributes souring to overheating of the animal previous to slaughter,\r\nbut tests were made by driving hogs to the point of exhaustion just\r\nprior to slaughter and curing the hams from these animals in comparison\r\nwith hams taken from animals which had been rested prior to slaughter,\r\nwith no difference in the cured product; that is, the hams taken from\r\noverheated hogs cured equally as well as those taken from rested hogs.\r\n\r\nAnother theory attributes souring to a diseased condition of the meat.\r\nPrior to the enforcement of the Federal regulations governing meat\r\ninspection there might have been some ground for such a supposition,\r\nbut this theory could not hold at the present time, in view of the\r\nthorough and efficient inspection now in force, for it can be safely\r\nsaid that no diseased meat now passes the Government inspectors, and\r\ntherefore no diseased meat goes into cure in inspected houses. In\r\norder to test this theory, however, hams were secured from a number\r\nof condemned animals which showed various diseased conditions, such\r\nas hog cholera, pyemia, septicemia, scirrhous chord, etc., and these\r\nhams were cured in comparison with hams taken from normal hogs. It was\r\nfound that the hams taken from the diseased hogs cured equally as well\r\nas those taken from healthy hogs. The hams from the diseased hogs were\r\ndestroyed after the experiment, as the meat taken from diseased animals\r\nwas of course not considered fit for consumption, the object of the\r\nexperiment being merely to determine whether or not souring is caused\r\nby diseased conditions.\r\n\r\nAnother theory attributes souring to imperfect or too rapid chilling\r\nof the meat before it is put in pickle, and places the blame upon the\r\nrefrigeration. According to this theory, souring results when the meat\r\nis chilled too suddenly, the idea being that by the rapid congealing of\r\nthe juices of the meat a coating is formed on the outside of the ham\r\nwhereby the animal heat is prevented from escaping from the interior,\r\nleaving the meat next to the bone at a higher temperature than the\r\noutside of the ham.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this last theory, a number of hog carcasses were run\r\ndirect from the killing floor to a cooler at 28° F. and a like number\r\nof carcasses of the same average weight which had been allowed to stand\r\nfor two hours at the outside temperature of the air (53° F.) were\r\nplaced in the same cooler. The carcasses which had hung for two hours\r\nin the air had lost an average of 14 degrees in temperature before\r\ngoing to the cooler. The temperature of the cooler rose to 29° F. after\r\nthe carcasses were put in, but was soon reduced to 28° F. and held at\r\nthis temperature. The temperatures of the hams were taken at the end\r\nof 24 hours, and practically no difference was found in the inside\r\ntemperatures of the two lots; that is, the hams on the hot carcasses\r\nwhich were subjected to a sudden chilling exhibited practically the\r\nsame inside temperature (i. e., next to the bone) as those which had\r\ncooled for two hours at the temperature of the air before being placed\r\nin the cooler.\r\n\r\nStill another theory attributes souring to lack of penetration of the\r\npickling fluids, but analyses of sour and sound hams do not seem to\r\nbear out this theory. The rate of penetration of the pickling fluids,\r\nhowever, would seem to have some bearing on the subject, and this point\r\nwill be discussed later in connection with some laboratory experiments\r\non the inhibitory effects of sodium chlorid and potassium nitrate.\r\n\r\nSo much for the more commonly accepted theories which have been\r\nadvanced to explain ham souring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL WORK TO DETERMINE CAUSE OF HAM SOURING.\r\n\r\n\r\nA review of the literature reveals but one article bearing directly on\r\nthe subject of the cause of ham souring.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1908, Klein[1] published in the London Lancet an article\r\non “miscured” hams. He describes a miscured ham as one which has a\r\ndistinctly putrid smell, and the tainted areas he describes as varying\r\nin color from a dirty gray to a dirty green, the muscular tissues in\r\nthe strongly tainted areas being swollen and soft, or jelly-like. From\r\nsuch hams he isolated a large nonmotile, nonspore-bearing, anaerobic\r\nbacillus which he calls _Bacillus fœdans_. He cultivated the organism\r\non different media and obtained from the cultures a putrid odor\r\nresembling that of the ham from which the culture was obtained, but\r\ndid not attempt to produce tainting by injecting sound hams with the\r\nbacillus.\r\n\r\n[1] Klein, E. On the nature and causes of taint in miscured hams. The\r\nLancet, vol. 174, London, June 27, 1908.\r\n\r\nWhile there can be little doubt that Klein’s bacillus was the cause of\r\nthe tainting in those hams which he examined, the proof would certainly\r\nhave been stronger had he injected sound hams with cultures and thus\r\nproven that he could reproduce tainting experimentally by means of his\r\nbacillus. Klein examined only dry-cured hams and does not state the\r\ntemperature at which they were cured. He fails to offer any explanation\r\nas to how the bacillus gained entrance into the hams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MEDIA EMPLOYED.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable experimentation as to a suitable culture medium for\r\nthe bacteriological study of sour hams, a modification of the “egg-meat\r\nmixture” used by Rettger[2] in his studies on putrefaction was found\r\nto be the most satisfactory. This medium, which consists of chopped\r\nmeat and egg albumen, furnishes an excellent medium for the growth of\r\nputrefactive organisms which rapidly break down the proteids of the\r\nmeat, giving rise to the characteristic odors of putrid decomposition.\r\nRettger used chopped beef and egg albumen, but for the present work\r\nchopped pork was substituted for the beef, as affording a more suitable\r\nmedium for the growth of organisms accustomed to growth in pork hams.\r\nThe modified medium is prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nA. One-half pound of lean pork, freed from excess of fat and sinew,\r\nis finely chopped in a meat chopper, 250 cubic centimeters of water\r\nis then added, the meat acids are neutralized with sodium carbonate,\r\nand the mixture is heated in an Arnold sterilizer for 30 minutes, with\r\noccasional stirring. It is then set away in a cold place for several\r\nhours. A small amount of fat collects at the top in the form of a fatty\r\nscum, as it is impossible to remove all of the fat from the meat before\r\nit is chopped. The fatty scum, which hardens upon standing in the cold,\r\nis now removed.\r\n\r\nB. The whites of three eggs are mixed with 250 cubic centimeters of\r\nwater. The mixture is rendered neutral to phenolphthalein by means\r\nof dilute hydrochloric acid and heated for 30 minutes in the Arnold\r\nsterilizer, with occasional stirring.\r\n\r\nA and B are now mixed and 2.5 grams (0.5 per cent) of powdered calcium\r\ncarbonate added. The mixture is next run into large sterile test tubes,\r\nor sterile flasks, and sterilized in an Arnold sterilizer on three\r\nsuccessive days.\r\n\r\n[2] Rettger, L. F. Studies on putrefaction. Journal of Biological\r\nChemistry, vol. 2, 1906.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the egg-pork mixture described above, culture tubes\r\nof agar and bouillon prepared from pork instead of beef, with the\r\naddition of 1 per cent of glucose, were also used; but the best results\r\nwere obtained with the egg-pork medium, as with this medium, the\r\nearly development of sour or putrefactive odors furnished a valuable\r\nindication as to the presence of organisms capable of producing sour or\r\nputrefactive changes in meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                METHOD OF PROCEDURE IN EXAMINING HAMS.\r\n\r\nThe hams were sectioned through the body, the femur, or “middle bone,”\r\nas it is known in packing-house parlance, being cut at a point about\r\n1½ or 2 inches below its head. A cross section of a ham thus cut\r\nis shown in figure 1. After sectioning, the hams were subjected to a\r\nmicroscopical, bacteriological, and chemical examination as follows:\r\n\r\n_Microscopical examination._—Bits of muscular tissue, taken from\r\nvarious points, were teased out in salt solution and the condition of\r\nthe muscle fibers noted. Smear preparations were also made from bits\r\nof muscular tissue and from the bone marrow, and these were stained\r\nand subjected to microscopical examination. Portions of the meat were\r\nalso hardened and cut into microscopic sections, which were stained and\r\nmounted for histological and bacteriological study.\r\n\r\n_Bacteriological examination._—In the bacteriological examination\r\nof sour hams, especial attention was directed to the detection of\r\nanaerobic species, as it seemed reasonable to suppose that if the\r\nchanges taking place in sour hams were due to bacteria these bacteria\r\nwould in all likelihood be anaerobes (i. e., organisms which develop\r\nin the absence of oxygen). This assumption was based upon the fact\r\nthat, as a rule, souring begins in the interior of the ham next to the\r\nbone, and, furthermore, the hams are cured in large vats where they\r\nare completely submerged in the pickling fluids, so that any bacteria\r\nwhich develop within the bodies of the hams while they are in cure are\r\nprobably restricted to practically anaerobic conditions.\r\n\r\nCultures were made from the interiors of the hams at various points by\r\nfirst searing the cut surface thoroughly with a heavy metal spatula and\r\nthen cutting out, by means of sterile scissors and forceps, plugs of\r\nmeat about 1 cm. square. The plugs of meat were then dropped into tubes\r\ncontaining the egg-pork medium and pushed down to the bottom of the\r\ntubes, where they were held in place by the chopped meat above; in this\r\nway conditions favorable for the development of anaerobic organisms\r\nwere obtained. In inoculating the pork-agar tubes, the medium was\r\nfirst boiled to expel any inclosed air and cooled to 43° to 45° C; the\r\nplugs of meat were then dropped into the tubes and the agar rapidly\r\nsolidified by plunging the tubes in cold water; in this way the bits of\r\nmeat were inclosed in the agar at the bottom of the tubes, affording\r\nsuitable conditions for anaerobic growth. Aerobic and anaerobic plates\r\nwere also made from the meat, and in most cases bouillon tubes were\r\nalso inoculated. Cultures were always taken from the bone marrow as\r\nwell as from the meat. Novy jars were also used for obtaining anaerobic\r\nconditions in growing the cultures.\r\n\r\n_Chemical examination._—In order to determine whether the souring was\r\nconnected with or dependent upon a lack of penetration of the pickling\r\nfluids to the interior of the meat, the hams were further subjected to\r\na chemical examination and the content of the meat in sodium chlorid\r\nand potassium nitrate determined at varying depths.\r\n\r\n\r\n            RESULTS OF EXAMINATION OF SOUR AND SOUND HAMS.\r\n\r\nThe sour hams examined were obtained from four different packing\r\nestablishments. All of the hams studied were “sweet-pickle hams” which\r\nhad not been smoked. The sour hams selected for examination were good\r\ntypical body sours, in which the sour odor was well developed, but not\r\nof the very pronounced or putrefactive type.\r\n\r\nThe sour odor in every case was found to be more pronounced next to\r\nthe bone, being usually rather more pronounced just behind the bone,\r\nthat is, on the fat side of the bone. The sour odor in each instance\r\nwas confined to an area of meat immediately surrounding the femur and\r\nextending out through the body of the ham for a variable distance, as\r\nshown by the dotted lines in figure 1, but in no case did the sour odor\r\nextend all the way to the margin of the meat, nor did it as a rule\r\nextend below the tibio-femoral articulation, the shank proper and the\r\nbone marrow of the shank (i. e., of the tibia) being usually sweet. The\r\nbutt portion of the hams—that portion above and behind the hitch bone\r\n(symphasis pubis)—was also sweet.\r\n\r\nImmediately after sectioning, the sour areas, as a rule, could be\r\nreadily distinguished by a difference in color. In the freshly cut\r\nhams the muscular tissue near the bone, where the sour odor was more\r\npronounced, exhibited a slight but distinct grayish hue, at times\r\nhaving a slight greenish tinge; in other words, the muscular tissue in\r\nthe sour areas lacked the normal bright red color of the sound meat\r\nand was distinctly lighter in color than the surrounding tissues.\r\nUpon exposure to air, however, the lighter, grayish, sour areas tend\r\nto assume a reddish hue and become much less pronounced than in the\r\nfreshly cut ham. After the cut surface of the ham has been exposed to\r\nthe air for some time it may be difficult to distinguish the sour areas\r\nby any difference in color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBUL. 132, BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY, U. S.

This was usually quite noticeable in cutting out plugs of the\r\nmeat for making cultures. In a ham which shows pronounced souring the\r\nmuscular tissues in the worst affected areas may become quite soft and\r\neven slightly gelatinous.\r\n\r\nThe sour areas, when tested with litmus paper, frequently showed a\r\nslight but distinct alkaline reaction. When aqueous extracts of the\r\nsour meat, however, were titrated with phenolphthalein they were found\r\nto be acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  HISTOLOGICAL CHANGES IN SOUR HAMS.\r\n\r\nIn preparations made by teasing out bits of the meat in physiological\r\nsalt solution, the cross striation of the muscle fibers from the sour\r\nareas was found to be much less distinct than in similar preparations\r\ntaken from sound portions of the meat or from sound hams. At times it\r\nwas found that the muscle fibers in the sour areas had completely lost\r\ntheir cross striæ, but the longitudinal striation could still be made\r\nout. In cases where the souring was pronounced there was sometimes\r\ncomplete loss of both longitudinal and cross striation; in these cases\r\nthe muscle fibers appeared to have undergone slight swelling and the\r\nprotoplasm exhibited a finely granular appearance.\r\n\r\nIn stained sections of the sour meat another striking change was\r\nnoticed in the disintegration of the nuclei of the muscle fibers, which\r\nare at times completely broken up, appearing as bluish granular masses\r\nin sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. (Compare figs. 1 and 2\r\nof Pl. I.)\r\n\r\nIn sections stained by the Gram-Weigert method to show the presence of\r\nbacteria, a large Gram-staining bacillus was noted between the muscle\r\nfibers in the connective-tissue elements of the muscle. In some of the\r\nsections these bacilli were present in great numbers, sometimes in\r\ndensely packed clumps or masses, while in other sections, or in other\r\nportions of the same section, they were only sparsely distributed\r\nbetween the muscle fibers. Where the bacteria were more numerous the\r\nhistological changes in the muscle fibers, especially the breaking\r\ndown of the nuclei, were more noticeable. The intermuscular connective\r\ntissue had apparently furnished paths of least resistance along which\r\nthe organism followed. In Plate II, figures 1 and 2, the bacteria are\r\nshown between the muscle fibers under low and high power magnifications.\r\n\r\nIn Plate II, figure 1, under the low-power magnification, the bacteria\r\nappear as dark clumps or bands between the muscle bundles. Under the\r\nhigh power they are shown following along the sarcolemma sheaths\r\nbetween the muscle fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF SOUR AND SOUND HAMS.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether there was any difference in regard to the\r\npenetration of the pickling fluids in the sour hams as compared with\r\nsound hams, a series of four sour hams were subjected to a chemical\r\nexamination in comparison with four sound hams. All were sweet-pickle\r\nhams and were obtained from the same packing establishment. They were\r\nall of the same cure and the same approximate age (i. e., length of\r\ncure) and the same approximate weight.\r\n\r\nIn taking samples for chemical analysis, the following procedure was\r\nadopted: A section about 2½ inches wide was cut from the center of\r\nthe body. The two ends of this section were then trimmed off along\r\nthe lines L-M and N-O, as shown in figure 2. Beginning at the skinned\r\nsurface, four slices, A, B, C, and D, were then made, as indicated by\r\nthe dotted lines. Slice B contained the bone in each instance. Slice\r\nD was practically all fat. Each slice was ground separately in a meat\r\nchopper and the sample thoroughly mixed before taking out portions for\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Cross section through body of ham to show method\r\nof sampling for chemical analysis.

KNO₃.\r\n    Average for 4 sour hams (entire ham)   per cent.  3.84    0.143\r\n    Average for 4 sound hams (entire ham)     do      3.93     .131\r\n\r\nThese figures show practically no difference between the sour and the\r\nsound hams as regards the sodium chlorid and potassium nitrate content\r\nof the entire ham.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we compare the bone slices—and these afford really a better\r\nbasis for comparison, as in sour-body hams the souring is always more\r\npronounced around the bone—we have the following figures:\r\n\r\n                                                      NaCl.   KNO₃.\r\n    Average for 4 sour hams (bone slice)   per cent.  4.48    0.155\r\n    Average for 4 sound hams (bone slice)     do      4.52    0.129\r\n\r\nHere, again, we find no essential difference between the sour and the\r\nsound hams, and we must conclude from these analyses that souring does\r\nnot depend upon or result from a lack of penetration of the pickling\r\nfluids.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that in mild-cure hams, which are pumped in the\r\nshank only, the souring begins in the upper portion of the shank and\r\nextends upward along the bone into the body of the ham, and that it\r\ntakes place before the pickling fluid has penetrated to the interior\r\nof the ham. When the pickling fluid reaches the interior of the ham\r\nit tends to inhibit the souring, which, as will be shown later, is\r\ndue to the development of bacteria within the bodies of the hams. The\r\ngrowth of the bacteria, however, within the bodies of the hams and the\r\nhistological changes in the muscle fibers do not seem to interfere with\r\nthe penetration of the pickling fluids.\r\n\r\n\r\n          BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SOUR AND SOUND HAMS.\r\n\r\nIn all of the sour hams which were examined bacteriologically a large\r\nanaerobic bacillus was found to be constantly present. From several\r\nof the hams this bacillus was obtained in pure culture; that is, it\r\nwas the only organism present in cultures made from the sour meat and\r\nfrom the bone marrow of the femur. Such cultures, when held at room\r\ntemperature, gave, at three days, a sour-meat odor exactly resembling\r\nthat obtained from sour hams.\r\n\r\nIn many of the sour hams other bacteria were found in association with\r\nthe anaerobic bacillus noted above. These other bacteria, however, were\r\nnot constant, being sometimes present and sometimes absent. Among the\r\nother bacteria noted in the sour hams, the following forms occurred\r\nmost frequently:\r\n\r\n1. A nonmotile, gram-positive bacillus, measuring from 1.5 to 4 microns\r\nin length by 0.5 micron in breadth, sometimes in chains and filaments.\r\n\r\n2. A small, nonmotile, gram-negative bacillus, about the size of\r\n_Bacillus coli_ and usually in pairs.\r\n\r\n3. A large micrococcus.\r\n\r\nSometimes one and sometimes all of these bacteria were present in a\r\ngiven ham. They were encountered most frequently in hams which had\r\nbeen pumped in both body and shank, and were probably ordinary pickle\r\nbacteria. They were not strict anaerobes, but belonged to the class of\r\nfacultative or optional anaerobes; that is, organisms which will grow\r\neither with or without free oxygen. These bacteria were isolated and\r\ngrown on the egg-pork medium, but failed to give any characteristic\r\nsour or putrefactive odors, and were therefore discarded.\r\n\r\nA series of sound hams, all of them of mild cure—that is, hams which\r\nhad been pumped in the shank only—were also examined bacteriologically.\r\nIn examining these hams cultures were taken at varying depths,\r\nbeginning at the skinned surface and going backward toward the fat.\r\nCultures were also taken from the bone marrow of the femur. In the\r\ncultures taken near the skinned surfaces the ordinary pickle bacteria\r\nwere obtained, but these did not, as a rule, extend beyond a depth of\r\n3 centimeters below the skinned surface. The cultures taken from the\r\ndeeper portions of the hams and from the bone marrow of the femur were\r\nentirely negative—that is, failed to show any growth—and the anaerobic\r\nbacillus noted in the sour hams was not encountered in any of the\r\ncultures made from these hams.\r\n\r\nThe anaerobic bacillus isolated from the sour hams was found to\r\ncorrespond in morphology with the organism noted in the microscopic\r\nsections made from the muscular tissue. In view of this fact and the\r\nfact that it was constantly present in the sour hams examined, and was\r\ncapable of producing in egg-pork cultures a sour-meat odor of the same\r\nnature as that obtained from sour hams, this organism was subjected to\r\nfurther study and experimentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  INOCULATION EXPERIMENTS WITH HAMS.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which follow were conducted at two different packing\r\nestablishments in one of the larger packing centers of the country.\r\nThe officials at each of these establishments showed great interest in\r\nthe experiments and were most courteous and obliging in supplying the\r\nnecessary materials.\r\n\r\nThe first question to be decided was whether the bacillus isolated from\r\nsour hams was actually capable of causing ham souring. The bacillus in\r\nquestion had, when cultivated on the egg-pork medium, given rise to a\r\nsour odor similar to that obtained from sour hams, but this was not\r\nregarded as proof positive that the organism was the actual cause of\r\nsouring in hams. The proper way to decide this point seemed to be to\r\ninoculate hams with the bacillus and then subject these hams to the\r\nregular method of cure and see whether they became sour, just as the\r\npathogenic properties of a disease-producing organism are determined by\r\nthe inoculation of experiment animals. The first two experiments which\r\nfollow were designed to decide this point.\r\n\r\nIt was regarded as important to conduct similar experiments at two\r\ndifferent establishments, in order to determine whether the same\r\nresults would be obtained under the somewhat different conditions\r\nimposed by different methods of cure. The two experiments which follow\r\nwere carried out, therefore, at different establishments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Experiment I._\r\n\r\nIn carrying out this experiment four tierces of hams were “put down”\r\nor “packed”—that is, placed in cure. Two of the tierces were given the\r\nfancy or mild cure and two the regular or stronger cure. The hams in\r\ntwo of the tierces, one mild and one regular cure, were injected with\r\na culture suspension of the bacillus; the other two tierces were not\r\ninjected with culture and were put down to serve as checks on the\r\ncure. Hams weighing from 12 to 14 pounds were used for the mild cure,\r\nwhile for the regular cure hams weighing from 14 to 16 pounds were\r\nused. This was in accordance with the general rule which prevails in\r\npacking houses, the lighter hams being subjected to the mild cure and\r\nthe heavier hams to the regular cure. The only difference between the\r\nmild and the regular cure in this experiment lay in the pumping. The\r\nhams which were given the mild cure were pumped in the shank only,\r\nwhile those given the regular cure were pumped in the body as well as\r\nin the shank.\r\n\r\nAll of the hams had received the usual 48-hour chill. They were all\r\npumped with the same pumping pickle and cured in the same curing\r\npickle, and were in cure for the same length of time. The pumping and\r\ncuring pickles used were the regular pumping and curing pickles of the\r\nestablishment at which the experiment was carried out, and the hams\r\nwere cured in accordance with the fancy and regular cures as practiced\r\nat this establishment.\r\n\r\nThe hams were packed in new tierces which had been thoroughly scalded\r\nwith boiling water. The tierces were held in a curing room which was\r\nkept at an average temperature of from 34° to 36° F., the temperature\r\noccasionally going as high as 38° and 40° F., but never above 40°\r\nF. The hams were left in cure for about 70 days, which is a little\r\nlonger than the usual cure. The tierces were rolled three times during\r\nthe cure. At the end of the cure the hams in all four tierces were\r\ncarefully tested by an expert meat inspector, who knew nothing of the\r\ntreatment which the hams had received.\r\n\r\nThe hams in two of the tierces were inoculated with a culture\r\nsuspension prepared as follows: Ten tubes of egg-pork medium, each\r\ntube containing approximately 10 cubic centimeters of the medium,\r\nwere inoculated with the bacillus and held at room temperature (20°\r\nto 25° C.) for six days. The cultures were then filtered through\r\nsterile gauze into a large sterile flask; this was done in order to\r\nremove the particles of meat, which might otherwise have clogged the\r\nsyringes used in inoculating the hams. In transferring the contents\r\nof the culture tubes to the filter the tubes were washed out with\r\nsterile physiological salt solution (0.6 per cent sodium chlorid),\r\nand the meat particles on the filter were afterwards washed with the\r\nsalt solution, a sufficient quantity of the latter being used to bring\r\nthe total volume of filtrate to 400 cubic centimeters. A microscopic\r\npreparation from the filtrate showed the organisms in large numbers,\r\nwith an occasional rod showing a large terminal spore. This suspension\r\nwas used for the injection of 40 hams, each ham being given 10 cubic\r\ncentimeters, or the equivalent of 2.5 cubic centimeters of the original\r\nculture. The hams were injected with the culture suspension by means of\r\na sterile syringe carrying a long 5-inch needle. The needle was thrust\r\nwell into the body of the ham at a point near the upper end of the\r\nmiddle bone or femur, the latter being used as a guide in inserting\r\nthe needle and the injection being made into the tissues just behind\r\nand a little to one side of the upper end of the femur.\r\n\r\nThe details of the experiment were as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 1 (fancy cure)._—This tierce contained 20 hams\r\n    weighing from 12 to 14 pounds each. These hams were pumped in\r\n    the shank only. Immediately after pumping they were injected\r\n    with 10 cubic centimeters each of the liquid culture or\r\n    suspension described above. After injection the hams were\r\n    immediately packed in the tierce, which was then headed up,\r\n    filled with the regular curing pickle, and placed in cure.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure all of the hams\r\n    in this tierce save one were found to be sour. In 10 of them\r\n    the souring was very marked throughout the body of the ham\r\n    and extended into the shank as well. In six the souring was\r\n    very marked in the body of the ham, but did not extend into\r\n    the shank. In three there was slight but well-marked souring\r\n    in the body of the ham with no souring in the shank, and one\r\n    remained sweet. The probable explanation of the variation in\r\n    the degree and the extent of the souring will be discussed\r\n    later. The bone marrow of the femur or middle bone was tested\r\n    in all of the hams and found to be sour in 18. In one of the\r\n    hams which showed only slight souring in the body the souring\r\n    did not extend through to the bone marrow, and in the ham which\r\n    remained sweet the bone marrow was also sweet. The fact that\r\n    one ham in this tierce remained sweet was in all likelihood\r\n    due to an oversight in making the inoculations. In making the\r\n    inoculations the hams were spread out in a row on a table by a\r\n    packing-house assistant, who removed the hams as soon as they\r\n    were inoculated and placed them in tierces; and it is more than\r\n    probable that the assistant removed one of the hams before it\r\n    was inoculated in the interval when the writer was busy filling\r\n    the syringe for the next inoculation.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 2 (fancy cure)._—This tierce contained 20 hams of\r\n    the same average weight as the preceding. They were pumped in\r\n    the shank only, but were not injected with culture, being put\r\n    down to serve as checks on the hams in tierce No. 1. These\r\n    hams, therefore, were subjected to exactly the same cure and\r\n    were held under exactly the same conditions as those in tierce\r\n    No. 1, the only difference being that the hams in this tierce\r\n    were not injected with culture.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure all of the hams in\r\n    this tierce were found to be perfectly sound and sweet, showing\r\n    that the curing in this instance was properly carried out and\r\n    that the souring of the hams in tierce No. 1 was undoubtedly\r\n    due to the injections of culture which they received.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 3 (regular cure)._—This tierce contained 20 hams\r\n    weighing from 14 to 16 pounds each. These hams were pumped in\r\n    the shank and also in the body. Immediately after pumping they\r\n    were each injected in the same manner as those in tierce No. 1\r\n    with 10 cubic centimeters of culture. The hams were then packed\r\n    in tierce and placed in cure.\r\n\r\n    Result: At the end of the cure 9 of the hams were found to be\r\n    sour, while 11 remained sweet. Of the 9 hams which became sour,\r\n    1 showed very pronounced souring in the body and in the shank\r\n    as well, 3 showed very pronounced souring in the body, 1 showed\r\n    pronounced souring in the body, and 4 slight souring in the\r\n    body. The bone marrow of the femur was tested in all of the\r\n    sour hams and was found to be sour in 7. In 2 of the sour hams\r\n    which showed slight souring in the body the souring noted in\r\n    the meat had not extended through to the bone marrow.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 4 (regular cure)._—This tierce contained 20 hams\r\n    of the same average weight as those in tierce No. 3, and, like\r\n    the latter, were pumped in both shank and body, but were not\r\n    injected with culture. This tierce was put down to serve as\r\n    a check on tierce No. 3 and was held under exactly the same\r\n    conditions, the only difference being that these hams were not\r\n    injected with culture.\r\n\r\n    Result: At the end of the cure the hams were carefully tested\r\n    and all were found to be perfectly sound and sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Results of Experiment I._\r\n\r\n    ───────┬────────┬─────────┬────────┬─────────────\r\n    No. of │ Number │ Average │ Cure.  │ How pumped.\r\n    tierce.│of hams.│ weight  │        │\r\n           │        │ of hams.│        │\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n    ───────┼────────┼─────────┼────────┼─────────────\r\n           │        │_Pounds._│        │\r\n       1   │   20   │  12-14  │ Fancy  │Shank only\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n       2   │   20   │  12-14  │   do   │    do\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n       3   │   20   │  14-16  │Regular │Shank and body\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n       4   │   20   │  14-16  │   do   │    do\r\n           │        │         │        │\r\n    ───────┴────────┴─────────┴────────┴─────────────\r\n\r\n    ───────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────\r\n           │                 │    Condition at end\r\n           │                 │        of cure\r\n           │                 ├───────────┬─────────────\r\n    No. of │    Treatment    │ Number of │Percentage of\r\n    tierce.│                 │ sour hams │  sour hams\r\n    ───────┼─────────────────┼───────────┼─────────────\r\n       1   │Each ham injected│    19     │    95\r\n           │with 10 c.c. of  │           │\r\n           │culture.         │           │\r\n           │                 │           │\r\n       2   │Not injected with│     0     │     0\r\n           │culture; check on│           │\r\n           │tierce 1.        │           │\r\n           │                 │           │\r\n       3   │Each ham injected│     9     │    45\r\n           │with 10 c.c. of  │           │\r\n           │culture.         │           │\r\n           │                 │           │\r\n       4   │Not injected with│     0     │     0\r\n           │culture; check on│           │\r\n           │tierce 3.        │           │\r\n    ───────┴─────────────────┴───────────┴─────────────\r\n\r\nThree hams from each tierce were selected for bacteriological and\r\nhistological examination. From tierces 1 and 3, which contained the\r\ninjected hams, three of the most pronounced “sours” were selected from\r\neach tierce. In examining the hams bacteriologically the following\r\nmethod was adopted: The hams were sectioned near the center of the body\r\nand the larger or butt end turned up so as to expose the cut surface. A\r\ncross section of a ham thus cut is shown in figure 3.\r\n\r\nCultures were taken at the points indicated by the numbers and from the\r\nexposed bone marrow of the femur by first searing the surface, and then\r\ntaking out plugs of the meat or marrow by means of sterile instruments.\r\nThe plugs of meat or marrow were dropped into tubes containing egg-pork\r\nmedium and pushed to the bottom of the tubes by means of a sterile\r\nplatinum wire. In the cultures made from the sour hams from tierces 1\r\nand 3, which were injected with culture, the bacillus with which these\r\nhams were injected was found in practically every culture, although it\r\nwas sometimes absent in the cultures taken at points near the skinned\r\nsurfaces of the hams (i. e., at points 1, 4, and 5 in fig. 3). In the\r\ncultures taken from the meat, the bacillus was not always present in\r\npure culture, but this is not to be wondered at when we remember that\r\nthe pickling fluids often contain large numbers of bacteria of various\r\nkinds, and these, of course, find their way into the hams in the\r\npickling fluids. Especially is this true of the hams which are pumped\r\nin the body, where bacteria are actually pumped into the bodies of the\r\nhams in the pumping pickle. In the case of hams which are not pumped in\r\nthe body, the pickle bacteria do not appear to penetrate the body of\r\nthe ham to any great depth.\r\n\r\nIn figure 3 the plus signs after the figures represent the distribution\r\nof the sour-ham bacillus in one of the hams from tierce 1, and this\r\nmay be taken as a typical example of the other sour hams which were\r\nexamined in this experiment. It should be explained that the shaded\r\nareas are not intended to represent the actual limits of souring, but\r\nsimply the areas in which the sour odor was most pronounced and from\r\nwhich it could be readily obtained with the trier. In comparing the\r\nregular and mild cure hams, it was found that the areas of souring as\r\ndefined with the trier were more restricted in the regular cure hams,\r\nand this was undoubtedly due to the additional pumping which these hams\r\nreceived, whereby the growth of the bacillus was partially inhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    FIG. 3.—Cross section through body of artificially soured ham,\r\n    showing sour areas and points at which cultures were taken.\r\n    Darker shading indicates sour area in hams pumped in body and\r\n    shank; light shading indicates sour area in hams pumped in\r\n    shank only; figures indicate points at which cultures were\r\n    taken; plus signs indicate presence of bacillus; minus sign\r\n    indicates absence of bacillus; X indicates point of inoculation.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the sour-ham bacillus was present in cultures\r\ntaken at points outside the shaded areas, indicating that the organism\r\nhad extended generally throughout the bodies of the hams. As the\r\nhams were inoculated at a point just to one side of and a little\r\nbehind the femur (i. e., at the point X in the figure), the presence\r\nof the bacillus generally throughout the hams would indicate a very\r\nextensive multiplication of the original bacilli with which the hams\r\nwere injected. In view of the fact that the bacillus in question is\r\nnonmotile, the spread of the bacilli throughout the hams must result\r\nsimply from subdivision and growth by extension, and in spreading\r\nthroughout the hams the bacilli appear to follow along the connective\r\ntissue bands which afford paths of least resistance. In the cultures\r\nmade from the bone marrow the bacillus was recovered in pure culture\r\nfrom each of the hams examined, and it is probable that the bacillus\r\nfinds its way into the bone marrow from the meat by following along the\r\nsmall arteries which pass through the bone. The fact that the bacillus\r\nwas found in pure culture (i. e., uncontaminated) in the cultures\r\nmade from the bone marrow is explained probably by its capacity for\r\ngrowth by extension, and also by the fact that the pickling solutions\r\nprobably do not reach the bone marrow until late in the curing and\r\nthen only to a limited extent. The bacteria which ordinarily occur in\r\npickling fluids are not strict anaerobes and are not placed under the\r\nmost suitable conditions for growth when they reach the interior of\r\nthe ham, for it seems probable that in the interior of hams which are\r\ntotally submerged in pickling fluids the amount of available oxygen\r\nmust be extremely small. The ordinary pickle bacteria, therefore, would\r\nnot multiply as rapidly in the interior of the hams and would not find\r\ntheir way into the bone marrow as soon as would a strictly anaerobic\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nPure cultures of the sour-ham bacillus, recovered from the meat and\r\nbone marrow of the injected hams, were compared with cultures of the\r\noriginal bacillus used for inoculating the hams, and were found to be\r\nidentical. Furthermore, the bacillus with which the hams were injected\r\nwas recovered from the injected hams at points far removed from the\r\noriginal point of injection, showing that the organism had multiplied\r\nand extended throughout the bodies of the hams and that it was clearly\r\nresponsible for the souring which the hams had undergone.\r\n\r\nSound hams from tierces 2 and 4 were examined bacteriologically in the\r\nsame manner as the injected hams, and some of the cultures showed the\r\nordinary pickle bacteria, but in not a single instance did egg-pork\r\ncultures yield a sour odor, and in no case could the sour-ham bacillus\r\nbe demonstrated in any of these hams.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic sections and teased preparations of the muscle fibers in\r\nsalt solution were prepared from several of the sour hams in this\r\nexperiment, and these preparations showed the same histological changes\r\nand the same distribution of bacilli as noted in the natural sours.\r\n\r\nIn Plate III, figures 1 and 2, sections are shown of artificially\r\nsoured hams, that is, hams which were artificially soured by injections\r\nof culture; and if these figures be compared with the sections made\r\nfrom hams which had undergone spontaneous souring (see Pl. II, figs. 1\r\nand 2) the similarity in the form and distribution of the bacilli will\r\nbe at once apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    BUL. 132, BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY, U. S. DEPT.

In view of the fact that these tierces were held\r\nunder exactly the same conditions, we must conclude that the souring\r\nof the hams in tierce 1 was due to the injection of culture which they\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nComparing tierces 3 and 4, where the hams were pumped in both shank and\r\nbody, the hams in tierce 3 being injected with culture while those in\r\ntierce 4 were not, we find that in tierce 3 nine out of twenty, or 45\r\nper cent, of the hams became sour, whereas in tierce 4 all of the hams\r\nremained sweet. As the conditions of cure were the same for all four\r\ntierces, we must again conclude that the souring of the hams in tierce\r\n3 was directly attributable to the injections of culture which they\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIf now we compare tierces 1 and 3, the two tierces which were injected\r\nwith culture, we find that in the case of tierce 1, where the hams were\r\npumped in the shank only, 95 per cent became sour; whereas in the case\r\nof tierce 3, where the hams were pumped in both shank and body, only\r\n45 per cent became sour. In other words, the percentage of souring in\r\nthose hams which were pumped in the body as well as in the shank was 50\r\npercent less than in those hams which were pumped in the shank only.\r\nInasmuch as the only difference in the treatment accorded tierces 1\r\nand 3 lay in the additional pumping given the hams in tierce 3, we\r\nmust conclude that the marked diminution in the percentage of souring\r\nin the case of tierce 3 was undoubtedly due to the additional pumping\r\nwhich these hams received, the hams being saturated at the start with\r\nthe pumping pickle. It will be shown later that both sodium chlorid and\r\npotassium nitrate exert an inhibitory effect upon the bacillus with\r\nwhich the hams were injected, which directly bears out the foregoing\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIn tierces 2 and 4, the two check tierces which were not injected with\r\nculture, all of the hams were sweet at the end of the cure, showing\r\nthat the conditions under which the experiment was carried out were\r\nentirely favorable to a successful cure.\r\n\r\nThe sour odor obtained from the artificially soured hams in this\r\nexperiment was pronounced by the meat inspector who tested the hams,\r\nand who was entirely unaware of the treatment they had received, to be\r\nidentical with the usual sour odor which characterizes hams that have\r\nundergone spontaneous souring; in other words, there was no difference\r\nin odor between these artificially soured hams and natural sours.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the variation in the degree and the extent of the\r\nsouring exhibited by the individual hams in the two inoculated tierces,\r\nwhere some of the hams showed pronounced souring throughout the body\r\nand shank, while others which had been injected with the same amount of\r\nculture showed only slight souring in the body, several factors must\r\nbe considered, viz: (1) Differences in the reaction of the meat of the\r\nindividual hams which may have exerted an influence on the growth of\r\nthe bacteria with which the hams were injected. (2) Variations in the\r\ntexture of the muscle fibers and connective tissue of the individual\r\nhams, permitting in some cases a more rapid and thorough penetration of\r\nthe pickling fluids to the interior of the hams, whereby the inhibitory\r\neffect of the sodium chlorid and the potassium nitrate on the bacteria\r\nwould come into play earlier. (3) Variations in pumping, whereby more\r\nof the pickling solution was forced into some of the hams than into\r\nothers. Probably all three of these factors would have to be taken into\r\naccount in explaining the variation in the degree and extent of the\r\nsouring exhibited by the injected hams.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the souring of the bone marrow, we find that of nineteen\r\nsour hams in tierce 1 eighteen showed sour marrows, while in tierce 3\r\nnine sour hams showed seven sour marrows. The high proportion of marrow\r\nsours is not surprising when it is recalled that of the nineteen sour\r\nhams in tierce 1 the meat was markedly sour in sixteen, while of the\r\nnine sour hams in tierce 3 the meat was markedly sour in five. In the\r\ncase of the four sour hams in tierce 3 which showed slight souring in\r\nthe body, two of these showed sour marrows, while in two the marrows\r\nwere sweet. In this experiment the percentage of sour hams showing sour\r\nmarrows corresponds with the percentage of marrow-sour hams found in\r\nthe packing house, where, as has been pointed out before, a ham which\r\nis markedly sour in the body will practically always show sour marrow,\r\nwhile in hams which show only slight souring in the body the marrow is\r\ninvolved in about 50 per cent of the cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Experiment II._\r\n\r\nThis experiment was essentially a repetition of Experiment I, but was\r\ncarried out at a different packing establishment and under somewhat\r\ndifferent conditions.\r\n\r\nTwo lots of hams were injected with a culture suspension of the\r\nbacillus at different stages of the cure, or rather at different stages\r\nin the preparation for cure, i. e., (1) on the hanging floor, previous\r\nto chilling, and (2) after chilling and pumping and immediately before\r\npacking. Three tierces, each containing 20 hams, were put down. Two of\r\nthe tierces contained the hams injected with culture, while the third\r\ntierce contained check hams which had not been treated with culture.\r\nHalf of the hams in each tierce were pumped in the shank, while the\r\nother half were pumped in both body and shank. The same pumping and\r\ncuring pickles were used for all three tierces, and were the regular\r\npumping and regular curing pickles of the establishment at which the\r\nexperiment was carried out. The hams used were all 14 to 16 pounds\r\nin weight and were subjected to the usual 48-hour chill with an\r\nadditional chill of 48 hours after they were cut from the carcass. They\r\nwere packed in tierces which had been thoroughly scrubbed and cleaned\r\nwith boiling water. The tierces were held in a pickling room at a\r\ntemperature of 33° to 36° F., the temperature never rising above 36°\r\nF., and were rolled three times during the curing period. The hams were\r\nin cure for about eighty days. At the end of the cure the hams were\r\ncarefully tested by a trained meat inspector, who knew nothing of the\r\ntreatment they had received.\r\n\r\nThe culture suspension was prepared from 20 tubes of egg-pork medium\r\nin the same manner as that used in Experiment I, the cultures being\r\ndiluted with sufficient salt solution to give 400 cubic centimeters of\r\nsuspension. The cultures from which the suspension was prepared had\r\ngrown at room temperature for ten days. The suspension was examined\r\nmicroscopically and showed large numbers of the bacilli in the form\r\nof filaments or long chains, with many of the individual organisms\r\nshowing large terminal spores. The hams were injected with the culture\r\nsuspension in the same manner as those in Experiment I.\r\n\r\nThe details of the experiment were as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 1._—Contained 20 hams, each ham being injected\r\n    with 20 cubic centimeters of the suspension or the equivalent\r\n    of 10 cubic centimeters of the original culture. The hams were\r\n    injected while on the hanging floor, before they had been cut\r\n    from the carcasses and previous to chilling. The carcasses were\r\n    still quite warm—that is, had lost but little of their body\r\n    heat when the injections were made. The carcasses, which had\r\n    been carefully tagged, were then run into coolers and given the\r\n    usual 48-hour chill, after which the hams were severed from the\r\n    carcasses and given an additional 48-hour chill in accordance\r\n    with the custom of the packing house at which the experiment\r\n    was carried out. The hams were next pumped with regular pumping\r\n    pickle, 10 being pumped in both body and shank and 10 in shank\r\n    only. They were finally packed in a tierce, which was then\r\n    headed up, filled with regular curing pickle, and placed in\r\n    cure.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure it was found that\r\n    the 10 hams which were pumped in the shank only were all sour.\r\n    In each of them the souring extended throughout the entire ham,\r\n    in the shank as well as in the body, and was very pronounced,\r\n    so much so that they were characterized as “stinkers” by the\r\n    meat inspector who assisted in testing them. The bone marrow\r\n    of the femur or middle bone was sour in all of these hams. Of\r\n    the 10 hams which were pumped in both body and shank 7 showed\r\n    well-marked souring throughout the body, but the souring did\r\n    not extend into the shank. The bone marrow of the femur was\r\n    found to be sour in 6 of these hams, while in 1 the souring had\r\n    not extended through to the bone marrow.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 2._—Contained 20 hams which were chilled and pumped\r\n    in exactly the same manner as those in tierce No. 1. These hams\r\n    were injected with culture after they had been chilled and\r\n    pumped, or just before they were placed in cure. The hams in\r\n    this tierce, therefore, were injected with culture four days\r\n    later than those in tierce 1. The hams were injected with a\r\n    bacterial suspension prepared in the same manner as that used\r\n    for tierce 1, except that the egg-pork cultures from which\r\n    the suspension was prepared were 7 days instead of 10 days\r\n    old. Each ham was injected with 20 cubic centimeters of the\r\n    suspension or the equivalent of 10 cubic centimeters of the\r\n    original culture. The hams were injected in the same manner as\r\n    those in tierce 1.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure, it was found that\r\n    of the 10 hams which were pumped in the shank all were sour; in\r\n    8 of these the souring was very marked throughout the body of\r\n    the ham and extended into the shank; in all of these hams the\r\n    souring had extended through to the bone marrow of the middle\r\n    bone or femur. Of the 10 hams which were pumped in both body\r\n    and shank 6 were sour in the body. These hams were classed by\r\n    the meat inspector who examined them as “light body sours,”\r\n    and in none of them did the souring extend into the shank or\r\n    through the bone into the bone marrow of the femur.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce No. 3._—Contained 20 hams which were chilled and pumped\r\n    in the same manner as those in the two preceding tierces. These\r\n    hams were not injected with culture and were put down to serve\r\n    as checks on the cure. In other words, they were pumped with\r\n    the same pickling fluids, were subjected to exactly the same\r\n    cure, and were held under precisely the same conditions as\r\n    those in the preceding tierces, the only difference being that\r\n    the hams in this tierce were not injected with culture.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure, all of the hams in\r\n    this tierce were found to be perfectly sound and sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Results of Experiment II._\r\n\r\n    ───────┬──────┬─────────┬──────────────────────\r\n           │      │         │\r\n    No. of │Number│ Average │     How pumped.\r\n    tierce.│  of  │ weight  │\r\n           │hams. │ of hams.│\r\n           │      │         │\r\n    ───────┼──────┼─────────┼──────────────────────\r\n           │      │_Pounds._│\r\n           │      │         │{ 10 in shank\r\n       1   │  20  │  14-16  │{\r\n           │      │         │{\r\n           │      │         │{ 10 in body and shank\r\n           │      │         │\r\n           │      │         │{ 10 in shank\r\n       2   │  20  │  14-16  │{\r\n           │      │         │{\r\n           │      │         │{ 10 in body and shank\r\n           │      │         │\r\n       3   │  20  │  14-16  │{ 10 in shank\r\n           │      │         │{ 10 in body and shank\r\n    ───────┴──────┴─────────┴───────────────────────\r\n    ───────┬───────────────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n           │                           │Condition at end of\r\n    No. of │        Treatment.         │      cure.\r\n    tierce.│                           ├————————┬——————————\r\n           │                           │ Number │Percentage\r\n           │                           │of sour │ of sour\r\n           │                           │  hams. │  hams.\r\n    ───────┼───────────────────────────┼────────┼───────────\r\n           │                           │        │\r\n           │Each ham injected with 20  │   10   │   100\r\n       1   │c. c. of culture prior to  │        │\r\n           │chilling and pumping.      │        │\r\n           │    do                     │    7   │    70\r\n           │                           │        │\r\n           │Each ham injected with 20  │   10   │   100\r\n       2   │c. c. of culture subsequent│        │\r\n           │to chilling and pumping.   │        │\r\n           │    do                     │    6   │    60\r\n           │                           │        │\r\n       3   │Not injected with culture. │    0   │     0\r\n           │    do                     │    0   │     0\r\n    ───────┴───────────────────────────┴────────┴──────────\r\n\r\nFour hams were selected from each tierce for bacteriological and\r\nhistological examination. From tierces 1 and 2, in which the hams\r\nwere injected with culture, 4 of the sourest hams were selected from\r\neach tierce. Cultures were made from these hams in the same manner\r\nas described under Experiment I and with the same result—that is,\r\nthe sour-ham bacillus was found throughout the bodies of the hams.\r\nMicroscopic sections were also prepared from these hams and showed the\r\nsame histological changes and the same distribution of bacilli as noted\r\nfor the hams in Experiment I.\r\n\r\n_Summary and discussion of Experiment II._—Comparing tierces 1 and 2,\r\nin which the hams were injected with culture, with tierce 3, where the\r\nhams were not injected with culture, we find that in tierce 1 seventeen\r\nhams (85 per cent) became sour and in tierce 2 sixteen hams (80 per\r\ncent) became sour, whereas in tierce 3 all of the hams were sweet. The\r\nfact that all of the hams in tierce 3, the check tierce, were sweet\r\nindicates that the conditions were favorable for a successful cure; and\r\nas all three tierces were cured under exactly the same conditions, the\r\nonly difference being that the hams in tierces 1 and 2 were injected\r\nwith culture, whereas those in tierce 3 were not injected with culture,\r\nwe must conclude that the souring of the hams in tierces 1 and 2 was\r\ndue to the injections of culture which they received.\r\n\r\nComparing tierce 1 with tierce 2, we find that the hams in tierce 1\r\nshowed more extensive souring than did those in tierce 2, this being\r\nespecially noticeable in the case of the hams which were pumped in both\r\nbody and shank. This difference in the extent or degree of souring was\r\nprobably due to the fact that the hams in tierce 1 were injected while\r\nthey were still warm and before they had lost their animal heat, the\r\nbacterial suspension thus having a better chance to become disseminated\r\nthrough the meat. The hams in tierce 2 were injected with culture after\r\nthey had been chilled, when the tissues were more or less contracted\r\nand the conditions less favorable for the dissemination of the\r\nsuspension throughout the meat. The hams in tierce 1 were also injected\r\nfour days earlier than those in tierce 2, and prior to pumping; and\r\nthis would explain the greater difference in the extent of the souring\r\nin the case of the hams which were pumped in both body and shank, as in\r\ntierce 1 the bacteria had four days in which to develop before coming\r\nin contact with the pickling fluids, whereas in tierce 2 the bacteria\r\nwere injected after the hams were pumped with pickle and were thus\r\nbrought into immediate contact with the pickling fluids, which, as will\r\nbe shown later, have a distinct inhibitory action upon the bacillus in\r\nquestion. In the case of the hams which were pumped in the shank but\r\nnot in the body there was not this difference, as in these hams the\r\npickling fluids must penetrate into the bodies of the hams from the\r\noutside. As it requires some time for the pickling fluids to reach the\r\ninterior of a ham, the bacteria were thus afforded quite an interval\r\nin which to develop before being exposed to the inhibitory action of\r\nthe pickling fluids. A chemical study of the processes involved in\r\nham curing has been carried out in the Biochemic Division and the\r\napproximate rate of penetration of the curing pickle determined,\r\nand it was found that it required about four weeks for the interior\r\nof a 10-pound ham which had not been pumped to acquire its maximum\r\npercentage of sodium chlorid.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: In this experiment 40 hams were injected with culture,\r\nhalf of this number being pumped in the shank only and half in both\r\nbody and shank. Of the 20 which were pumped in the shank only, every\r\nham without exception, or 100 per cent, became sour. Of those which\r\nwere pumped in both body and shank, 13, or 65 per cent, became sour.\r\nThe reduction in the percentage of sours in the last lot was clearly\r\ndue to the additional pumping which these hams received.\r\n\r\nIf now we compare tierce 2 in this experiment with tierces 1 and 3 in\r\nExperiment I—these three tierces being comparable, as they were all\r\ninjected with culture at the same stage in their preparation for cure,\r\nthat is, subsequent to chilling and pumping—we find, in the case of the\r\nhams pumped in both body and shank, 65 per cent of sours in Experiment\r\nII as against 45 per cent in Experiment I, and this difference is\r\nundoubtedly due to the heavier dose of culture used in Experiment\r\nII, where the hams were given the equivalent of 10 cubic centimeters\r\nof egg-pork culture as against 2½ cubic centimeters in Experiment\r\nI. In the case of the hams which were pumped in the shank but not in\r\nthe body, the percentage of sours was practically the same in the two\r\nexperiments—in Experiment I all but one of these hams became sour,\r\nwhile in Experiment II all of them became sour. The degree or extent of\r\nthe souring in these last hams, however, was greater in Experiment II,\r\na result of the heavier injections of culture which they received.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Summary of Experiments I and II._\r\n\r\nSummarizing the results obtained in Experiments I and II, we find that\r\nculture suspensions of the anaerobic bacillus isolated from sour hams\r\ncaused souring with great uniformity when injected into the bodies of\r\nsound hams which were pumped in the shank only. In the two experiments,\r\n40 sound hams which were pumped in the shank only were injected with\r\nculture suspensions of the bacillus, with the result that 39, or 97.5\r\nper cent, became sour during the process of cure; and it is quite\r\nprobable, as we have pointed out before, that one of these hams was\r\noverlooked in making the inoculations, otherwise the entire lot would\r\nhave become sour.\r\n\r\nThe inhibitory action of the pickling fluids upon the bacillus is well\r\nshown in the case of those hams which were pumped in both body and\r\nshank. Out of 40 hams which were pumped in both body and shank, 22, or\r\n55 per cent, became sour in the process of curing. Inasmuch as these\r\nhams were cured under precisely the same conditions as the hams which\r\nwere pumped in the shank only, we must conclude that the diminution in\r\nsouring in these hams was undoubtedly due to the additional pumping\r\nwhich they received, whereby the bacteria with which these hams were\r\ninjected were brought into immediate contact with the strong pumping\r\npickle and their development thereby inhibited.\r\n\r\nIn these two experiments it was proven beyond doubt that the anaerobic\r\nbacillus isolated from sour hams was capable of producing souring\r\nwhen introduced into the bodies of sound hams; and in view of the fact\r\nthat this bacillus was constantly present in hams which had undergone\r\nspontaneous or natural souring, and was the only organism that could\r\nbe isolated from such hams that was capable of producing in egg-pork\r\ncultures the characteristic sour-ham odor, the conclusion seems\r\njustifiable that this bacillus is an undoubted cause of the ham souring\r\nwhich occurs in the packing house; and the results thus far obtained\r\nindicate that it is an important, if not the only, factor concerned in\r\nham souring.\r\n\r\nHaving established the etiological relation of the bacillus isolated\r\nfrom sour hams with ham souring, the next point to be considered was\r\nthe manner in which this bacillus finds its way into the bodies of the\r\nhams.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PROBABLE METHOD BY WHICH HAM-SOURING BACILLUS ENTERS HAMS.\r\n\r\nRegarding the question of the probable method by which the ham-souring\r\nbacillus enters hams, there were three possibilities to be taken into\r\nconsideration: (1) That the bacillus is present in the flesh of hogs at\r\nthe time of slaughter, (2) that the bacillus gains entrance through the\r\npickling fluids, (3) that the bacillus is introduced into the bodies\r\nof the hams in the handling or manipulation which the hams undergo in\r\npreparation for, or during, the process of curing.\r\n\r\n\r\n             POSSIBILITY OF INFECTION PRIOR TO SLAUGHTER.\r\n\r\nIn order to throw some light upon this point, a number of fresh\r\nhams—that is, hams which had been chilled but not pumped or subjected\r\nto any other manipulation—were examined bacteriologically, but in no\r\ncase could the anaerobic bacillus which was isolated from sour hams\r\nbe detected in any of them. The fact that in certain of the smaller\r\npacking establishments which cure their hams without pumping the\r\npercentage of souring is extremely low would also seem to negative this\r\npossibility, for if the bacillus which causes souring were present in\r\nthe hams at the time of slaughter, sour hams would be as frequent at\r\nsuch establishments as at those establishments which make a practice of\r\npumping. Furthermore, a laboratory study, biological and chemical, of\r\nthe bacillus isolated from sour hams shows that this organism belongs\r\nto the class of putrefactive bacteria, and while such bacteria may be\r\npresent in the intestines of healthy animals, as, for example, the\r\nbacillus of Bienstock (_Bacillus putrificus_), these bacteria do not\r\ninvade the organs and tissues of the body until after the death of the\r\nanimal, and the packing-house practice of rapidly eviscerating the hogs\r\nimmediately after slaughter would certainly preclude this possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n               POSSIBLE INFECTION FROM PICKLING FLUIDS.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second possibility, that the bacillus finds its way\r\ninto the hams in the curing pickles, it was determined by laboratory\r\nexperiment that the addition of 3 per cent of sodium chlorid or 3 per\r\ncent of potassium nitrate to laboratory media completely inhibits\r\nthe growth of the bacillus. As the pickling solutions always contain\r\nconsiderably more than these percentages of sodium chlorid and\r\npotassium nitrate, it would be impossible for the bacillus to multiply\r\nin the pickles. Additional laboratory experiments demonstrated,\r\nhowever, that the bacillus or its spores may remain alive in the curing\r\npickles for at least thirty days, and it seemed possible that the\r\ncuring pickles might become contaminated at times with the bacilli, and\r\nthat the bacilli, although incapable of multiplying in the pickles,\r\nmight find their way into the bodies of the hams in the pickling\r\nfluids. In order to throw some light upon this point, the following\r\nexperiment was carried out:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT TO SHOW WHETHER INFECTION TAKES PLACE FROM THE CURING PICKLE.\r\n\r\nIn this experiment two tierces were put down, each containing 20 hams.\r\nThe hams weighed from 14 to 16 pounds and had received the usual\r\n48-hour chilling. The pickling solutions employed were the regular\r\ncuring pickles of the establishment at which the experiment was carried\r\nout. The curing pickle in one tierce was inoculated with 400 cubic\r\ncentimeters of a culture suspension of the bacillus, prepared in the\r\nsame manner as that used for the injection of the hams in tierce 2 in\r\nExperiment II. A microscopic preparation made from a small drop of the\r\nculture suspension before adding it to the pickle showed the bacilli\r\nin large numbers, and in the 400 cubic centimeters of the suspension\r\nthere were millions of the bacteria. The curing pickle in the other\r\ntierce was left untreated, the hams in this tierce serving as a check.\r\nThe tierces used in this experiment, as in all of the experiments, were\r\nthoroughly cleaned with boiling water before the hams were placed in\r\nthem. The experiment was conducted in a pickling room which was held at\r\n33° to 36° F., and the tierces were rolled three times during the cure.\r\nThe details of the experiment are as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Tierce 1._—Contained 20 hams, half of which were pumped in\r\n    both body and shank and half in the shank only. As soon as they\r\n    were pumped the hams were packed in the tierce. Sufficient\r\n    curing pickle to fill the tierce was then measured out in a\r\n    clean barrel and to it was added the culture suspension. The\r\n    culture was thoroughly mixed with the pickle and the latter was\r\n    then run into the tierce containing the hams.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure, two of the hams\r\n    which had been pumped in the shank only showed slight souring\r\n    in the body. The rest of the hams were sweet.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce 2._—Contained 20 hams which were pumped in the same\r\n    manner as those in tierce 1. The curing pickle was the same as\r\n    that used for tierce 1, but without the addition of culture.\r\n    This tierce was put down as a check on tierce 1, the hams\r\n    being cured under exactly the same conditions, but without the\r\n    addition of culture to the curing pickle.\r\n\r\n    Result: One of the hams which was pumped in the shank only\r\n    developed slight souring in the body. The remainder of the hams\r\n    were sweet.\r\n\r\nComparing tierce 1, which contained the inoculated pickle, with tierce\r\n2, the check tierce which contained uninoculated pickle, we find\r\nthere was practically no difference in the final result. In tierce 1\r\ntwo of the hams developed slight souring, while in tierce 2 one of\r\nthe hams became slightly sour. All of these hams had been pumped in\r\nthe shank only. The fact that one of the hams in the check tierce\r\ndeveloped slight souring was undoubtedly due to bacterial contamination\r\nin pumping or in the handling which the hams underwent prior to\r\npickling, and the slight souring of the two hams in tierce 1 must\r\nalso be attributed to the same cause or causes, for had the souring\r\nin these last hams resulted from the penetration of the bacteria from\r\nthe pickling solution a higher percentage should have become sour.\r\nFurthermore, if the souring of the two hams in tierce 1 had resulted\r\nfrom the penetration of the bacteria from the curing pickle, the\r\nsouring should have been general throughout the bodies of these hams,\r\nwhereas the souring was only evident around the bone and was slight in\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nFrom this experiment the conclusion would seem justified that the\r\nbacillus which causes ham souring does not usually find its way into\r\nthe bodies of the hams from the curing pickle, although it would be\r\ngoing too far, perhaps, to say that infection never takes place from\r\nthe curing pickle. The experiment, however, indicates clearly that the\r\ncuring pickles are certainly not the main channel through which the\r\nhams become infected. In referring to the curing pickles, it should be\r\nunderstood that we refer here to the pickling solutions in which the\r\nhams are immersed, and not to the pumping pickles. The possibility of\r\ninfection through the pumping pickle will be discussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n         POSSIBLE INFECTION THROUGH MANIPULATION OR HANDLING.\r\n\r\nThere are at least three possible ways in which hams may become\r\ninfected from the handling which they receive in preparation for, or\r\nduring the process of curing, viz: From the thermometers used in taking\r\nthe inside temperatures of the hams, from the pumping needles, and from\r\nthe billhooks used in lifting the hams.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   INFECTION FROM HAM THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\nThe packing-house method of taking the temperatures of hams by means\r\nof a pointed, metal-capped thermometer which is thrust deep into the\r\nbodies of the hams has already been referred to, but deserves to be\r\ndescribed somewhat more in detail, as it will be at once apparent\r\nthat this manipulation furnishes a ready means whereby hams may\r\nbecome infected with putrefactive bacteria. The construction of a ham\r\nthermometer is shown in figure 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.   B.\r\n\r\n    FIG. 4.—Diagrammatic views showing construction of ham\r\n    thermometer. A, front view, showing open space between metal\r\n    point and mercury bulb, which becomes filled with particles of\r\n    meat, grease, and dirt; B, side view.]\r\n\r\nThe instrument consists of a glass thermometer inclosed in a metal\r\ncase, the front portions of the case being cut away so as to expose\r\nthe scale above and the mercury bulb below. As was explained before,\r\nthe thermometer is thrust deep into the body of the ham so that the\r\npointed end containing the mercury bulb rests beside or a little behind\r\nthe upper portion of the femur, the bone being used as a guide in\r\nintroducing the thermometer.\r\n\r\nHam temperatures are taken at three stages in the preparation for\r\ncure—(1) on the hanging floor, just before the hams go to the chill\r\nrooms, in order to determine the amount of heat lost prior to chilling;\r\n(2) on leaving the chill rooms, in order to determine the thoroughness\r\nof the chill; (3) on the packing floor, just before the hams are placed\r\nin pickle, as a further check on the thoroughness of the chilling.\r\n\r\nIn taking the temperatures of hams which have been chilled—and most\r\nof the temperatures are taken subsequent to chilling—it is customary\r\nfor the packing-house attendant who has this matter in charge to warm\r\nthe thermometer by holding the pointed or bulb end in his hand, so\r\nas to force the mercury column up to about 60° F., or well above the\r\ntemperature of hams. The thermometer is then thrust into the ham and\r\nallowed to remain for several minutes, by which time the mercury column\r\nwill have fallen to the temperature of the ham. The thermometer is then\r\nslowly withdrawn so as to expose the top of the mercury column, and\r\nan accurate reading is thus obtained of the inside temperature of the\r\nham. The thermometer is warmed by the hand before each ham is tested,\r\nand this undoubtedly insures more accurate readings than would result\r\nwere the thermometer removed from one ham and plunged immediately into\r\nanother, but the procedure is open to certain objections, for the open\r\nspace between the metal point of the thermometer and the mercury bulb\r\nsoon becomes filled with particles of meat and with grease and dirt\r\nfrom the attendant’s hands, and it is at once apparent that a thermometer\r\nin this condition would furnish a ready means whereby extraneous matter\r\nmight be introduced into the bodies of the hams. In other words, a\r\ncontaminated thermometer would furnish an excellent means whereby hams\r\ncould be inoculated with putrefactive bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine whether hams actually become inoculated in this\r\nmanner, the following experiment was carried out:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENT TO SHOW WHETHER HAMS BECOME INFECTED FROM HAM THERMOMETERS.\r\n\r\nThis experiment was designed to show (1) whether the usual\r\npacking-house method of taking ham temperatures was apt to induce\r\nsouring in the hams thus tested, and (2) whether souring would result\r\nin hams which were tested with a thermometer purposely contaminated\r\nwith the bacillus isolated from sour hams.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was carried out as follows: Thirty hog carcasses were\r\nselected as they entered the hanging floor from the killing floor. They\r\nhad been cleaned, eviscerated, and split, and were of the same average\r\nweight and of sufficient size to yield hams weighing from 12 to 14\r\npounds. They were divided into three lots of 10 each and were allowed\r\nto remain on the hanging floor for two hours, after which they were\r\ngiven the usual 48-hour chilling.\r\n\r\n    _Lot 1._—The hams in this lot were tested with an ordinary ham\r\n    thermometer as they entered the hanging floor, as they left the\r\n    hanging floor, and as they left the coolers. The thermometer\r\n    used was borrowed from one of the plant attendants and was used\r\n    in the condition in which it was received from him; that is, it\r\n    was not cleaned or disinfected prior to use.\r\n\r\n    _Lot 2._—The hams in this lot were tested as they entered the\r\n    hanging floor with a thermometer which had been previously\r\n    cleaned and disinfected and then dipped in a culture suspension\r\n    of the meat-souring bacillus which was isolated from sour\r\n    hams. The thermometer was dipped in the culture suspension\r\n    before each ham was tested. No further temperatures were taken\r\n    of these hams. The thermometer was carefully cleaned and\r\n    disinfected before it was returned to the attendant from whom\r\n    it was borrowed.\r\n\r\n    _Lot 3._—The hams in this lot were not tested at all, and were\r\n    intended as checks on the cure.\r\n\r\nThe three lots of carcasses were carefully tagged and were chilled in a\r\nspecial cooler to themselves. Upon leaving the cooler the hams were cut\r\nfrom the carcasses and trimmed. The three lots of hams were then cured\r\nin separate tierces. All of the hams were subjected to exactly the same\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nThe pickles used were the regular pumping and regular curing pickles of\r\nthe establishment at which the experiment was carried out.\r\n\r\nThe hams in lot 3 were pumped first and those in lot 1 were pumped\r\nnext. The needle was then removed and a fresh, clean needle was used\r\nfor lot 2. This was done in order to prevent the possibility of\r\ncarrying over bacteria from one lot of hams to another on the pumping\r\nneedle. The tierces were thoroughly cleaned with boiling water before\r\nbeing used. The curing was carried out in a pickling cellar which was\r\nheld at 33° to 36° F., the temperature never rising above the latter\r\nfigure. The tierces were rolled three times during the curing. The\r\ndetails and results were as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Tierce 1._—Contained 20 hams, half of which were pumped in\r\n    both body and shank and half in the shank only. These hams were\r\n    taken from the carcasses in lot 1 and had been tested several\r\n    times with a ham thermometer, as already described.\r\n\r\n    Result: At the end of the cure it was found that of the 10 hams\r\n    which were pumped in the shank, 5 showed well-marked souring in\r\n    the body, while of the 10 hams which were pumped in both body\r\n    and shank, 2 showed slight souring in the body.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce 2._—Contained 20 hams, which were pumped in the same\r\n    manner as those in tierce 1. These hams were taken from the\r\n    carcasses in lot 2 and had been tested once with a thermometer\r\n    which was dipped in a culture suspension of the bacillus\r\n    isolated from sour hams.\r\n\r\n    Result: The 10 hams which were pumped in the shank only all\r\n    became sour. When they were tried out at the end of the cure,\r\n    they showed pronounced souring throughout the entire body and\r\n    were classed as “stinkers” by the meat inspector who examined\r\n    them. The souring extended through to the bone marrow of the\r\n    femur in all of these hams. Of the 10 hams which were pumped in\r\n    both body and shank, 7 showed well-marked souring in the body,\r\n    but not as pronounced as in those pumped in the shank only; in\r\n    five of these hams the souring extended through to the bone\r\n    marrow of the femur, while in 2 the bone marrow remained sweet.\r\n\r\n    _Tierce 3._—Contained 20 hams, which were pumped in the same\r\n    manner as those in the two preceding tierces. These hams were\r\n    not tested with a thermometer, and were put down as a check\r\n    on the cure. They were pumped with the same pumping pickle,\r\n    subjected to the same cure, and held under precisely the same\r\n    conditions as the hams in the two preceding tierces.\r\n\r\n    Result: When tested at the end of the cure, all of these hams\r\n    were found to be perfectly sound and sweet.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Results of experiment to show whether hams become infected from ham\r\n                            thermometers._\r\n   ────────┬────────┬───────────┬──────────────┐\r\n           │        │           │              │\r\n           │        │           │              │\r\n    No. of │ Number │  Average  │ How pumped.  │\r\n    tierce.│   of   │ weight of │              │\r\n           │  hams. │   hams.   │              │\r\n   ────────┼────────┼───────────┼──────────────┤\r\n           │        │ _Pounds._ │              │\r\n           │        │           │              │\r\n           │        │           │{ 10 in shank │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n       1   │   20   │   12-14   │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{ 10 in body  │\r\n           │        │           │{   and shank │\r\n           │        │           │              │\r\n           │        │           │{ 10 in shank │\r\n       2   │   20   │   12-14   │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{ 10 in body  │\r\n           │        │           │{   and shank │\r\n           │        │           │              │\r\n           │        │           │{ 10 in shank │\r\n       3   │   20   │   12-14   │{             │\r\n           │        │           │{ 10 in body  │\r\n           │        │           │{   and shank │\r\n   ────────┴────────┴───────────┴──────────────┘\r\n\r\n   ────────┬─────────────────┬──────────────────\r\n           │                 │  Condition at\r\n           │                 │   end of cure.\r\n    No. of │                 ├───────┬──────────\r\n    tierce.│    Treatment.   │Number │Percentage\r\n           │                 │of sour│  of sour\r\n           │                 │ hams. │   hams.\r\n   ────────┼─────────────────┼───────┼──────────\r\n           │                 │       │\r\n           │Tested at several│   5   │    50\r\n           │stages in        │       │\r\n       1   │preparation for  │       │\r\n           │cure with ham    │       │\r\n           │thermometer which│       │\r\n           │had not been     │       │\r\n           │cleaned.         │       │\r\n           │     do          │   2   │    20\r\n           │                 │       │\r\n           │                 │       │\r\n           │Tested once with │  10   │   100\r\n       2   │ham thermometer  │       │\r\n           │dipped in culture│       │\r\n           │suspension of    │       │\r\n           │anaerobic        │       │\r\n           │bacillus isolated│       │\r\n           │from sour hams.  │       │\r\n           │     do          │   7   │    70\r\n           │                 │       │\r\n           │                 │       │\r\n       3   │Not tested with  │   0   │     0\r\n           │thermometer.     │       │\r\n           │     do          │   0   │     0\r\n   ────────┴─────────────────┴───────┴──────────\r\n\r\nSeveral hams from each tierce were examined bacteriologically. cultures\r\nbeing taken from the meat near the bone and from the bone marrow of the\r\nfemur.\r\n\r\nIn the sour hams from tierce 1 cultures taken from the meat near the\r\nbone showed the same anaerobic bacillus noted in other sour hams (i.e.,\r\nthe same bacillus which caused souring in Experiments I and II),\r\nbut these cultures were contaminated with other bacteria which were\r\nprobably introduced on the thermometer along with the ham-souring\r\nbacillus. None of the contaminating bacteria were capable, however,\r\nof producing a sour-meat odor when grown on the egg-pork medium. Pure\r\ncultures of the ham-souring bacillus were obtained from the bone marrow\r\nof some of these hams, showing that this bacillus had penetrated\r\nthrough to the bone marrow while the other bacteria had not.\r\n\r\nFrom the sour hams in tierce 2 the ham-souring bacillus was recovered\r\nreadily, and often in pure culture, from the hams which had been pumped\r\nin the shank only, whereas it was usually contaminated with pickle\r\nbacteria in the hams which had been pumped in both body and shank.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the sound hams in tierce 3, cultures taken from the meat\r\nnear the bone and from the bone marrow of the femur were negative in\r\nthe hams which had been pumped in the shank only, while cultures taken\r\nfrom corresponding points in the hams pumped in both body and shank\r\nshowed ordinary pickle bacteria, which had evidently been introduced\r\ninto the bodies of these hams in the pumping pickles. None of these\r\nhams exhibited the slightest sour odor.\r\n\r\n_Summary of experiment._—In this experiment 20 hams (tierce 1) were\r\ntested with an ordinary ham thermometer in the usual packing-house\r\nmanner. Half of these hams were subjected to the mild cure and half\r\nwere given the regular cure, with the result that 50 per cent of those\r\nreceiving the mild cure and 20 per cent of those receiving the regular\r\ncure became sour.\r\n\r\nA second lot of 20 hams (tierce 2) were tested with a thermometer\r\nwhich had been purposely contaminated with a culture suspension of the\r\nham-souring bacillus. These hams were cured in the same manner as the\r\nfirst lot, with the result that all of those receiving the mild cure\r\nand 70 per cent of those receiving the regular cure became sour.\r\n\r\nA third lot of 20 hams (tierce 3) which had not been tested at all were\r\ncured in the same manner as the two preceding lots, as a check on the\r\ncure. All of these hams were sweet at the end of the cure.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the three lots of hams were cured under precisely the same\r\nconditions and were handled in the same manner prior to pickling, the\r\nonly difference being that the hams in tierces 1 and 2 were tested with\r\nthe ham thermometer while those in tierce 3 were not, we must conclude\r\nthat the souring of the hams in tierces 1 and 2 resulted from the\r\ntesting which these hams received. In the case of tierce 1 the hams\r\nbecame infected from a thermometer which, in the ordinary routine use\r\nof the packing house, had become accidentally contaminated with the\r\nham-souring bacillus. In the case of tierce 2 the hams became infected\r\nfrom a thermometer which had been artificially contaminated with the\r\nbacillus. The high percentage of sours in this last lot is due to\r\nthe fact that these hams were heavily infected with the ham-souring\r\nbacillus, for owing to the construction of the ham thermometer many\r\nthousands of the bacilli were unquestionably introduced into each\r\nham on the point of the thermometer. In the ordinary routine of ham\r\ntesting, where hams become infected from foreign matter introduced on\r\nthe thermometer, the percentage of souring, as shown in tierce 1, would\r\nbe less, for it is not to be supposed that ham thermometers are always\r\ncontaminated with the ham-souring bacillus, but that they only become\r\nso at times, and that probably only a few of the bacilli are then\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThis experiment, we think, proves conclusively (1) that the ham-souring\r\nbacillus may be introduced into the bodies of hams on the thermometers\r\nused in testing the hams, and (2) that the packing-house method of\r\ntaking ham temperatures by means of a thermometer which is thrust deep\r\ninto the bodies of the hams may cause souring in the hams thus tested.\r\n\r\nAs a further proof that hams may become contaminated in this manner,\r\na series of cultures were made from scrapings taken from ham\r\nthermometers. The scrapings consisted of the accumulations of bits\r\nof meat, grease, and dirt that collect on the thermometers, and were\r\ntaken from the thermometers while the latter were in ordinary routine\r\nuse in the packing house. In a series of six cultures which were made\r\nfrom such scrapings at different times, the same bacillus which was\r\nisolated from sour hams and shown to cause meat souring was found three\r\ntimes. In other words, the ham-souring bacillus was present in 50 per\r\ncent of the cultures made from thermometer scrapings, and many hams\r\nundoubtedly become infected from the thermometers. Souring would be\r\nalmost certain to result in mild-cure hams if these hams were tested\r\nwith a thermometer which had become accidentally contaminated with\r\nthe ham-souring bacillus, as the bacillus would have time to develop\r\nwithin the bodies of the hams before being inhibited by the curing\r\npickle, which penetrates slowly into the bodies of these hams. In the\r\ncase of regular cure hams—that is, hams which are pumped in both body\r\nand shank—souring would be much less apt to occur after the use of a\r\ncontaminated thermometer, as these hams are more or less saturated with\r\na strong pumping pickle at the beginning of the cure, which would tend\r\nto inhibit the growth of any bacteria that might be introduced on the\r\nthermometers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that souring may result in hams from the use of a contaminated\r\nthermometer would explain the occurrence of several sours in one vat,\r\nfor in testing hams just before they go into cure several hams are\r\nusually tested in succession, and these would in all likelihood go into\r\nthe same vat. Supposing the thermometer to have been contaminated with\r\nthe ham-souring bacillus at the time these hams were tested, this would\r\nexplain a fact which has been often noted, namely, the occurrence of\r\nseveral sours in one vat while other vats containing the same run of\r\nhams show no sours.\r\n\r\nIf souring resulted in all of the hams which are subjected to a\r\nthermometer test in the daily routine of the packing house, this\r\nmanipulation alone might account for nearly all of the sours which\r\noccur, but the experiment which has been just described shows that\r\nall of these hams do not become sour. In tierce 1, where each ham\r\nwas subjected to three thermometer tests at different times, souring\r\nresulted in 35 percent (this includes both mild and regular cure) of\r\nthe hams thus tested, and in actual practice the percentage of sours in\r\nhams which have been subjected to the thermometer test would probably\r\nbe somewhat less. Quite a large percentage of sour hams are thus left\r\nunaccounted for by the thermometer test, and we believe that these are\r\nchiefly the result of contamination carried in on the pumping needles\r\nor in the pumping pickles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INFECTION FROM PUMPING NEEDLES.\r\n\r\nIn view of the results obtained in the last experiment, in which it was\r\nshown that hams may become infected from the use of ham thermometers,\r\nit seemed not improbable that hams might also become infected from\r\nthe pumping needles, which, like the thermometers, are thrust deep\r\ninto the bodies of the hams beside the bone. In order to throw some\r\nlight upon this point, cultures were taken from the grease and dirt\r\nthat accumulate on the shields at the bases of the pumping needles,\r\nas such material must undoubtedly be carried into the hams at times\r\non the needles. The ham-souring bacillus was found several times in\r\nthese cultures, and hence it is fair to infer that hams may also\r\nbecome infected at times from the pumping needles, just as they become\r\ninfected from the thermometers. Bits of contaminated meat and grease\r\nand particles of dirt carried in on the pumping needles would be forced\r\nout into the hams by the pumping pickle, which passes out through small\r\nopenings or fenestræ in the needles, and this probably affords one\r\nexplanation as to why so many more body sours occur in the mild-cure\r\nhams. In the mild-cure hams, which are pumped in the shank only, the\r\npumping needle is introduced near the femorotibial articulation, and\r\nthe shank is saturated at the start with a strong brine solution, while\r\nthe body of the ham is not. If the ham-souring bacillus were carried\r\ninto these hams on the pumping needle, the growth of the bacillus in\r\nthe shank would be inhibited by the strong brine solution with which\r\nthe shank is saturated, but there would be nothing to prevent the\r\nbacillus from growing upward into the body of the ham, which has not\r\nbeen pumped and is free from pickle. This would also explain the fact\r\nthat the souring often starts at the knee joint and extends upward into\r\nthe body of the ham. In the case of the regular cure hams, where the\r\nham is pumped in both body and shank, the entire ham is more or less\r\nsaturated at the start with the strong brine of the pumping pickle,\r\nwhich tends to inhibit the growth of the ham-souring bacillus even\r\nif this bacillus should find its way into these hams on the pumping\r\nneedles. It is in the mild-cure or partly pumped hams, where the body\r\nof the ham is left unpumped, that the ham-souring bacillus finds its\r\nbest opportunity for development, and the greater proportion of the\r\nsours that occur in the packing house are found in these hams.\r\n\r\nAs regards the possibility of infection from the pumping pickle\r\nitself, it does not seem probable that this would often occur, for\r\nthe pumping and curing pickles are always prepared on an upper floor\r\nof the pickling houses and are delivered to the pickle cellars in\r\nclosed pipes, so the chances for the accidental contamination of these\r\nsolutions from floating dust or dirt would not be great. Furthermore,\r\nthe strong brine of the pumping pickle would completely inhibit the\r\ngrowth of the ham-souring bacillus, and the bacillus would be incapable\r\nof multiplying, even if it found its way into the pickle. On the other\r\nhand, laboratory experiments show that the bacillus or its spores may\r\nremain alive for a considerable length of time in the pumping pickle,\r\nso the possibility of infection from this source can not be overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INFECTION FROM BILLHOOKS.\r\n\r\nAfter the hams are cut from the carcasses they are handled entirely\r\nby means of billhooks. In handling the hams the hooks are inserted\r\nbeneath the skin of the shank at a point just above the tibio-femoral\r\narticulation. The hooks should be inserted in the connective tissue\r\nbeneath the skin and should not penetrate the muscular tissue to any\r\ndepth. When the hams lie in the right position, with the butt or large\r\nportion away from and the shank toward the operator, it is an easy\r\nmatter to pick them up in the proper manner; but when they lie at\r\ndifferent angles and are being rapidly handled it is almost impossible\r\nto prevent the hook from penetrating the muscular tissues, and if the\r\nhook should penetrate to the bone it might carry in foreign matter\r\ncontaminated with the meat-souring bacillus. It is not probable that\r\nmany hams become contaminated in this way, as the men who handle the\r\nhams are very skillful in manipulating their hooks; but the possibility\r\nthat hams may become contaminated in this manner should not be entirely\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BIOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HAM-SOURING\r\n                               BACILLUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO GROWTH.\r\n\r\nThe most favorable medium for the growth of the organism was found\r\nto be the modified egg-meat mixture of Rettger, which has been\r\npreviously described. In this medium the organism develops rapidly\r\nat a temperature of 20° to 25° C., giving rise to the characteristic\r\nsour-meat odor. Like the bacillus described by Klein, it also grows\r\nreadily on pork-agar and pork-bouillon containing glucose, but differs\r\nfrom Klein’s bacillus in that it will grow, though less luxuriantly,\r\non ordinary nutrient media—agar, gelatin, and bouillon—without the\r\naddition of glucose.\r\n\r\nThe optimum temperature for growth is 20° to 25° C. The organism does\r\nnot grow at incubator temperature (37.5° C.). At ice-box temperature\r\n(8° to 10° C.) it develops readily, although the growth is less rapid\r\nthan at 20° to 25° C. That the organism will develop at even lower\r\ntemperatures was shown in the inoculation experiments with hams, where\r\nit developed and multiplied extensively in the bodies of the hams at\r\nthe temperature of the pickling cellars, which are held usually at 34°\r\nto 36° F. (1° to 2° C.).\r\n\r\nThe organism develops best in a neutral or slightly alkaline medium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  GROWTH ON DIFFERENT CULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\n_Growth on egg-pork medium._—At a temperature of 20° to 25° C. the\r\ncultures show a slight but distinct sour odor in from two to three\r\ndays. This odor, as before stated, closely resembles the odor of a\r\nsour ham. Egg-pork cultures from three to five days old were given to\r\na trained meat inspector, who knew nothing whatever as to the contents\r\nof the tubes, and he was asked to describe the odor; he described it as\r\nthat of a sour ham.\r\n\r\nAt one week the albumins of the medium are gelatinized or partly\r\ncoagulated and the odor is more pronounced. At ten days the albumins\r\nare completely coagulated except at the surface, where there is\r\nno apparent growth; the odor is more putrefactive in nature, and\r\nthe reaction of the medium is slightly acid. At three weeks the\r\ncoagulated albumin splits up into fragments and appears to undergo a\r\nslow digestion, gas bubbles form in the lower portion of the culture,\r\nand the odor becomes distinctly putrefactive in character. The slow\r\ndigestion of the albumin is probably due to a proteolytic enzyme\r\nelaborated by the bacillus.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week a dark zone usually appears at the surface of the\r\ncoagulated albumin and gradually darkens until it becomes almost black.\r\nThis zone is probably due to a pigment elaborated by the bacillus.\r\n\r\nAt ice-box temperature (8° to 10° C.) the same changes and the same\r\nodor were noted, but were somewhat slower in developing.\r\n\r\n_Glucose-pork-agar._—This medium was prepared from pork in the same\r\nmanner as beef-agar, and contained 1 per cent of glucose. The organism\r\ngrows readily on this medium and may be conveniently cultivated in deep\r\nstab cultures. The medium was always thoroughly boiled and then rapidly\r\ncooled in order to expel the inclosed air. The growth of the organism\r\nwas found to vary considerably with the reaction.\r\n\r\nWhen the reaction was +1.5, deep stab cultures at three days (20° to\r\n25° C.) showed a well-marked arborescent growth, appearing as delicate\r\nfilaments extending outward from the line of stab. The growth stopped\r\nwithin one-fourth or one-half inch of the surface of the agar on\r\naccount of the presence of oxygen in the upper part of the culture\r\nmedium. As the growth extended toward the walls of the test tube the\r\nagar became clouded, and there were sometimes gas bubbles in the depth\r\nof the agar, but the gas formation was not extensive.\r\n\r\nWhen the reaction of the agar is neutral or slightly alkaline,\r\nextensive gas formation occurs and the agar is often much broken up.\r\n\r\nThe cultures developed a disagreeable, somewhat putrefactive odor,\r\nbut did not give the characteristic sour-ham odor obtained from the\r\negg-pork cultures.\r\n\r\nThe organism was also grown on anaerobic agar plates by Zinsser’s method,\r\nwhich is said to give absolutely anaerobic conditions. The colonies on\r\nagar have a cottony or woolly appearance at first, and spread slowly,\r\nwith slightly irregular margins.\r\n\r\nIn glucose-pork-agar to which azolitmin was added the azolitmin in the\r\nlower portion of deep stab cultures was completely decolorized in five\r\ndays at room temperature (20° to 25° C).\r\n\r\nIn glucose-pork-agar containing neutral red the red color in the lower\r\nportion of the tube was changed to yellow with the development of\r\nfluorescence.\r\n\r\n_Neutral gelatin._—Tubes of ordinary neutral gelatin without the\r\naddition of glucose were inoculated and held at ice-box temperature\r\n(8° to 10° C). At five days a delicate white growth appeared along\r\nthe line of stab in the lower portion of the tube. At seven days the\r\ngrowth showed fine radial striæ, presenting an arborescent or tree-like\r\nappearance, and extended halfway from the line of stab to the walls of\r\nthe test tube. At two weeks the growth had caused a delicate clouding\r\nof the medium in the lower portion of the tube. At three weeks the\r\ngelatin in the lower portion of the tube had become liquefied and the\r\ngrowth had settled to the bottom as a white precipitate.\r\n\r\nIn gelatin containing glucose, gas bubbles are formed in the depth\r\nof the medium through the splitting up of the glucose, and the\r\ncharacteristic arborescent growth is obscured.\r\n\r\n_Glucose-pork-bouillon._—This medium was prepared from pork instead\r\nof beef and contained 1 per cent of glucose. The best results were\r\nobtained when the reaction of the medium was neutral or slightly\r\nalkaline.\r\n\r\nCulture tubes, which had been previously boiled to expel the contained\r\nair and then inoculated, were held in a Novy jar, in an atmosphere of\r\nhydrogen at a temperature of 20° to 25° C. At three days the tubes\r\nshowed well-marked clouding. At one week the growth appeared as a\r\nheavy, white, flocculent, cottony precipitate in the bottom of the\r\ntubes with a slight flocculent precipitate above. When the culture was\r\nremoved from the jar and shaken, the heavy, flocculent precipitate at\r\nthe bottom of the tube broke up without much difficulty, giving rise to\r\na heavy uniform clouding with some small floating masses, which soon\r\nsettled to the bottom. On shaking the tube some evolution of gas in the\r\nform of very fine bubbles was noticed.\r\n\r\nIn Smith fermentation tubes containing neutral glucose-pork-bouillon\r\nthe closed arm of the tube shows well-marked clouding with gas\r\nformation at three days at room temperature (20° to 25° C). The\r\ngrowth has a tufted, cottony appearance, and there are many filaments\r\nand threads. The growth settles to the bottom of the closed arm as\r\na cottony, white precipitate (see Pl. IV). The organism splits the\r\nglucose vigorously, and at 10 days the tubes show from 40 to 50\r\nper cent of gas. The bouillon in the open arm of the tube remains\r\nunclouded. The maximum gas production at room temperature is reached\r\nin from 10 to 14 days, by which time the growth in the closed arm has\r\ncompletely settled into the bend of the tube, leaving the bouillon\r\nin the closed arm clear. The gas formula, as determined by Smith’s\r\nmethod, was H/CO₂ = 5/1. The reaction of the bouillon becomes acid to\r\nphenolphthalein.\r\n\r\nThe organism will grow on ordinary neutral bouillon without the\r\naddition of glucose, and in Smith tubes containing this medium a small\r\namount of gas was formed, due to the splitting of the muscle sugar.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus also grows in a sugar-free broth—that is, a broth free\r\nfrom muscle sugar—and from cultures grown in this medium a well-marked\r\nindol test was obtained.\r\n\r\n_Litmus-milk._—The organism was grown in litmus-milk in Smith\r\nfermentation tubes at 20° to 25° C. At seven days the litmus in the\r\nlower portion of the closed arm had assumed a brownish-buff color.\r\nAt two weeks the litmus in the closed arm had been reduced to a\r\nbrownish-buff color except at the top of the tube, where a pale, bluish\r\ntinge remained, and the litmus in the open arm showed very slight\r\nreddening as compared with a check tube. At three weeks the litmus in\r\nthe closed arm was entirely reduced to a light, brownish-buff color,\r\nand the litmus in the open arm showed a slight but distinct reddening\r\nas compared with the check. The reddening of the litmus in the open arm\r\nwas evidently due to the transfusion of acids formed by the growth of\r\nthe bacillus in the closed arm. After several weeks the milk is slowly\r\npeptonized, probably as a result of enzyme action.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              MORPHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe organism is a large bacillus having an average size of 4 to 8 μ in\r\nlength by 0.5 to 0.7 μ in thickness, but there are many longer forms\r\nmeasuring from 10 to 20 μ in length. It develops in long, irregular\r\nchains or filaments, which at times show a slightly spiral form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    FIG. 5.—Ham-souring bacillus (_Bacillus putrefaciens_) grown\r\n    on egg-pork medium, showing tendency to form chains. Partly\r\n    developed and fully developed spores are shown at ends of rods;\r\n    also free spores. (Pen-and-ink drawing made with camera lucida\r\n    from preparation stained by Gram’s method. × 640.)]\r\n\r\nThe individual organisms show at times a widely open, slightly spiral\r\nform, which was more apparent in hanging-drop preparations made\r\nfrom bouillon cultures, where the organisms had been comparatively\r\nundisturbed. This appearance was also noted at times in the stained\r\nsections of soured muscular tissue, where the organisms were stained in\r\nplace. The organism possesses no motility. It stains with the ordinary\r\naniline dyes and by Gram’s method.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SPORE FORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe organism develops large, terminal spores, which are at first oval,\r\nbut when fully developed are perfectly round and measure from 1.5 to 2\r\nμ in diameter.\r\n\r\nSpores develop rapidly in the egg-pork medium at 20° to 25° C., fully\r\ndeveloped spores being noted in from five to seven days. At ice-box\r\ntemperature (8° to 10° C.) partly developed spores were noted in the\r\negg-pork medium at 10 days and fully developed spores at 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nOccasional spores were noted in old agar and gelatin cultures, but\r\nabundant spore formation was seen only in the egg-pork medium. No\r\nspores were noted in bouillon cultures, even at 10 weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                RESISTANCE TO HEAT AND CHEMICAL AGENTS.\r\n\r\nIn its vegetative form the bacillus is killed at 55° C. in 10 minutes.\r\nThe spores survive a temperature of 80° C. for 20 minutes, but are\r\nkilled at 100° C. in 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen sodium chlorid and potassium nitrate were added to glucose-pork\r\nbroth in varying amounts, it was found that 3 per cent of sodium\r\nchlorid or 3 per cent of potassium nitrate was sufficient to inhibit\r\ncompletely the growth of the bacillus at room temperature (20° to 25°\r\nC.).\r\n\r\nWhile the growth of the bacillus was inhibited by sodium chlorid and\r\npotassium nitrate as just stated, it was found that very much stronger\r\nsolutions of the two salts failed to destroy the bacillus. Thus it was\r\nfound that the bacillus or its spores retained their vitality after\r\nan exposure of 30 days in a solution containing 23 per cent of sodium\r\nchlorid and 6 per cent of potassium nitrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GAS PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe organism splits glucose, but not lactose or saccharose. That\r\nit possesses the power of splitting muscle sugar was shown by the\r\nformation of gas in Smith fermentation tubes containing ordinary\r\nneutral bouillon without the addition of any sugar.\r\n\r\nThe formation of gas in glucose bouillon varies considerably with\r\nthe reaction of the medium. The largest amount of gas was formed\r\nwhen the broth was neutral or slightly alkaline. When the reaction\r\nof the broth was distinctly acid or distinctly alkaline the amount\r\nof gas was diminished. The gas which is formed in bouillon cultures\r\nconsists chiefly of hydrogen and carbon dioxide. In order to collect a\r\nsufficient amount of the gas for analysis, two large fermentation tubes\r\ncapable of holding 150 cubic centimeters each were constructed. These\r\ntubes were filled with pork-bouillon and inoculated with the bacillus.\r\nAfter 20 days at room temperature (20° to 25° C.) the gas was collected\r\nand the carbon dioxide and hydrogen determined, with the following\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n                                            Cubic centimeters.\r\n    Total amount of gas collected                 37.7\r\n    Carbon dioxide, by absorption with NaOH        6.2\r\n    Hydrogen, by difference                       31.5\r\n\r\nThis analysis gives an approximate gas formula of H/CO₂ = 5/1, which\r\nagrees with the gas formula as determined in the small fermentation\r\ntubes by Smith’s method.\r\n\r\nIn hams which had undergone spontaneous souring and in hams which had\r\nbeen artificially soured by inoculation, hydrogen-sulphid was often\r\nnoted when the sour portions of the meat were tested with lead-acetate\r\npaper, but no distinct odor of the gas could be obtained. Hydrogen\r\nsulphid was also noted in egg-pork cultures of the bacillus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ACID PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn glucose-bouillon, butyric and lactic acids are formed and the\r\nreaction of the medium becomes distinctly acid. Butyric and lactic\r\nacids were also noted in the egg-pork cultures.\r\n\r\nA series of Smith fermentation tubes containing 10 c. c. each of\r\nglucose-pork broth medium was inoculated with the bacillus and held\r\nat room temperature (20° to 25° C.). These cultures were titrated\r\nagainst [N/40]NaOH, with phenolphthalein as an indicator at intervals\r\nof two days up to nineteen days, and then at two-week intervals up to\r\nsixty-one days. Three of the cultures were titrated each time so as to\r\ngive a fair average of the acidity of the cultures, and an uninoculated\r\ncheck tube was also titrated each time to see if there was any change\r\nin the reaction of the medium. The results of the titrations are shown\r\nin the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\n       _Acidity determinations in glucose-pork broth cultures._\r\n\r\n    ──────────────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬────────┬───────┬───────────\r\n    Age of culture│Culture│Culture│Culture│Average.│Medium.│Acidity of\r\n       (days).    │   A.  │   B.  │   C.  │        │       │ culture.\r\n    ──────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼────────┼───────┼───────────\r\n                  │       │       │       │        │       │_Per cent._\r\n           2      │ 0.038 │ 0.030 │ 0.040 │  0.036 │ 0.009 │   0.027\r\n           4      │  .105 │  .100 │  .102 │   .102 │  .009 │    .093\r\n           6      │  .106 │  .110 │  .109 │   .108 │  .009 │    .099\r\n           8      │  .124 │  .115 │  .117 │   .119 │  .009 │    .110\r\n          10      │  .128 │  .130 │  .126 │   .128 │  .009 │    .119\r\n          12      │  .129 │  .120 │  .129 │   .126 │  .009 │    .117\r\n          19      │  .126 │  .125 │  .125 │   .125 │  .009 │    .116\r\n          33      │  .125 │  .123 │  .125 │   .124 │  .009 │    .115\r\n          47      │  .122 │  .120 │  .121 │   .121 │  .009 │    .112\r\n          61      │  .121 │  .116 │  .119 │   .118 │  .009 │    .109\r\n    ──────────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴────────┴───────┴───────────\r\n\r\nFrom the above table it will be seen that the maximum acidity was\r\nreached at ten days, after which there was a gradual reduction in the\r\nacidity, due probably to the formation of ammonia compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PATHOGENIC PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\nRabbits, guinea pigs, and white mice were inoculated and fed with\r\ncultures of the bacillus without effect, from which it would appear\r\nthat the bacillus possesses no pathogenic or disease-producing\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NATURE OF THE BACILLUS.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus is essentially a saprogenic bacterium with zymogenic\r\nproperties. A preliminary study of the chemical changes which take\r\nplace in sour hams shows that these changes are of a putrefactive\r\nnature. Hams which had undergone spontaneous souring were compared\r\nwith hams which had been artificially soured by inoculation, and the\r\nchemical changes were found to be identical. A chemical study was also\r\nmade of the changes taking place in egg-pork cultures of the bacillus\r\nat different stages of growth, and these changes were found to be of a\r\nputrefactive nature and similar in character to the changes which occur\r\nin sour hams. Among the putrefactive products formed by the growth of\r\nthe bacillus in the egg-pork medium were indol, skatol, volatile fatty\r\nacids, skatol-carbonic acid, and hydrogen sulphid.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] The tests for the putrefactive products formed by the growth\r\nof the bacillus in the egg-pork medium were made by P. Castleman,\r\nof the Biochemic Division, who also determined the percentage\r\ncomposition of the gas formed by the growth of the bacillus in the\r\nglucose-pork-bouillon medium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    BUL. 132, BUREAU OF ANIMAL INDUSTRY, U. S.

The\r\nresults of this investigation will be given in a later paper.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus described in this paper belongs to the class of\r\nputrefactive anaerobes, which are widely distributed in nature in dust,\r\nsoil, and excrementitious matters. This group of bacteria contains\r\nboth pathogenic and nonpathogenic forms. The former have received\r\nconsiderable attention, but the latter have never been thoroughly\r\ncleared up. The bacillus isolated from sour hams belongs in the latter\r\ncategory, being possessed of no pathogenic or disease-producing\r\nproperties. It occurs in the dust and dirt of the packing house and\r\nfinds its way into the hams in the various manipulations to which the\r\nhams are subjected.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus described in this paper does not seem to correspond\r\nwith any forms heretofore described. It differs from Klei bacillus\r\n(_Bacillus fœdans_) in the following important particulars: (1) It\r\nforms large terminal spores, whereas Klein’s bacillus formed no spores;\r\n(2) it will grow at a temperature of 34° F., while Klei bacillus did\r\nnot grow below 50° F.; (3) it produces an acid reaction in culture\r\nmedia, while Klei bacillus gave a distinctly alkaline reaction;\r\n(4) it will grow on the ordinary nutrient media—gelatin, agar, and\r\nbroth—without the addition of glucose, while Klein’s bacillus did not;\r\n(5) it peptonizes the casein in milk, whereas Klein’s bacillus had no\r\naction on milk; (6) it liquefies gelatin more rapidly, causing complete\r\nliquefaction after three weeks at 8° to 10° C., whereas Klein’s bacillus\r\ncaused only partial liquefaction after eight weeks at 20° C.; (7) it\r\ncan be conveyed\r\nfrom turbid broth cultures to new culture material by means of the\r\nplatinum loop, whereas Klein’s bacillus could not be thus conveyed.\r\n\r\nFor the bacillus described in the present paper the following name is\r\nproposed: _Bacillus putrefaciens_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PREVENTION OF HAM SOURING.\r\n\r\nAs it has been shown that souring in hams results from the growth\r\nof a bacterium which is introduced into the bodies of the hams in\r\nthe various manipulations which the hams undergo, the only way to\r\neliminate souring in hams, as they are cured in the larger packing\r\nestablishments, would be to cure the hams under aseptic or sterile\r\nconditions, which would, of course, be a physical impossibility.\r\n\r\nWhile it will probably be impossible, therefore, to eliminate souring\r\nentirely under the methods of ham curing which are at present employed\r\nin the larger packing establishments, much can undoubtedly be done\r\ntoward reducing the percentage of sours. In the matter of taking ham\r\ntemperatures, for instance, if the thermometers used were thoroughly\r\ncleaned and disinfected and the surfaces of the hams seared at the\r\npoint where the thermometer is introduced, infection from this source\r\ncould be entirely prevented; or it might be possible so to regulate\r\nthe temperature of the chill rooms that the taking of ham temperatures\r\ncould be discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of the souring that results from the introduction of\r\nforeign matter on the pumping needles could be effected in two ways\r\nonly, (1) by not pumping the hams at all, or (2) by pumping them under\r\nsterile or aseptic conditions. As has been stated before, some of the\r\nsmaller packing establishments cure their hams without pumping, and in\r\nthese establishments the percentage of sours runs very low. When hams\r\nare cured without pumping, however, the period of curing has to be\r\nmaterially lengthened in order to give the curing pickles sufficient\r\ntime to penetrate thoroughly, and this is what the larger plants wish\r\nto avoid because of the greater space and greater number of vats which\r\nwould be necessitated. The object of pumping in the larger plants,\r\nwhere the number of hams handled daily runs into the thousands, is to\r\nhasten the cure and thus prevent the accumulation of a great number of\r\nhams at one time. It is doubtful, therefore, whether the larger packing\r\nhouses could conveniently discontinue pumping.\r\n\r\nTo pump the hams under aseptic conditions would necessitate a technique\r\nfar too elaborate for routine use in the packing house; in fact,\r\nanything like complete asepsis would be out of the question. Certain\r\nmeasures might be adopted, however, that would tend to prevent the\r\npossible introduction of ham-souring bacilli in the process of pumping.\r\nIt would undoubtedly be safer, for instance, to boil the pumping pickle\r\nbefore use, and the chances of carrying in contaminated foreign matter\r\non the pumping needles could be lessened by sterilizing the pumps and\r\nneedles with boiling water and by frequently dipping the needles, while\r\nin use, in boiling water. If the hams were sprayed with clean water\r\njust prior to pumping, there would be less likelihood of carrying in\r\nforeign matter on the needles. The danger of introducing contaminated\r\nforeign matter on the needles might be further obviated by searing the\r\nsurfaces of the hams at the points where the needles are introduced;\r\nbut such a procedure would be hardly practicable in the larger packing\r\nhouses, where the great number of hams cured necessitates rapid\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\nWhile the danger of possible contamination in pumping, through the\r\nintroduction of contaminated foreign matter on the pumping needles,\r\ncan not well be avoided, this danger is partly counterbalanced by the\r\ninhibitory action of the pumping pickle, which is strikingly shown in\r\nthe experiments which have been described. In these experiments, 100\r\nhams received large doses of the ham-souring bacillus, half of these\r\nhams being subjected to the mild cure and half to the regular cure,\r\nwith the following result: In the case of the mild-cure hams, which\r\nwere pumped in the shank only, the percentage of sours was practically\r\n100 per cent, every ham with possibly one exception becoming sour;\r\nwhereas in the regular-cure hams, which were pumped in both body and\r\nshank, only 58 per cent of the hams became sour. In other words, the\r\nadditional pumping which the regular-cure hams received served to\r\nprevent souring in 42 per cent of these hams. In these experiments the\r\nnumber of bacteria introduced into the hams was very great, thousands\r\nand even millions of the bacilli being introduced into each ham,\r\nwhereas in the routine of the packing house it is not likely that\r\nmore than a few of the bacilli are ever introduced at one time on the\r\nthermometers and pumping needles. In view of these results it is safe\r\nto say that in the larger packing houses, where pumping seems to be\r\nnecessary, the number of sours could be reduced fully 50 per cent if\r\nall hams were pumped in the body as well as in the shank.\r\n\r\nAt present the usual procedure is to pump all hams, both mild and\r\nregular cure, with the same pumping pickle, the mild-cure hams being\r\npumped in the shank only and the regular-cure hams at two additional\r\npoints in the body. The experiments quoted above show that the\r\nadditional pumping which the regular-cure hams receive undoubtedly\r\ntends to prevent the development of souring in these hams, and this\r\nresult is unquestionably due to the inhibitory action of the salts\r\ncontained in the pumping pickle, as it was found by laboratory\r\nexperiment that the addition of 3 per cent of sodium chlorid to\r\nculture media is sufficient to inhibit the growth of the ham-souring\r\nbacillus. The pumping pickles consist of strong brine solutions and\r\nalways contain considerably more than 3 per cent of sodium chlorid.\r\nIf, therefore, the pumping of regular-cure hams were made more\r\nthorough than at present, and all of the deeper portions of the ham\r\nwere thoroughly saturated with the strong brine solution, souring\r\ncould be largely eliminated, if not entirely prevented, in these hams,\r\nas an unfavorable medium or soil would thus be created in which the\r\nham-souring bacillus could not develop. The ham-souring bacillus is\r\nable to develop within the bodies of the regular-cure hams because the\r\npumping of these hams is not always thorough and there are certain\r\nareas in the inner or deeper portions of the hams in which the tissues\r\nare not thoroughly saturated with the pumping pickle.\r\n\r\nUnder the present methods of curing, the greater proportion of the\r\nsours occur among the partly pumped or mild-cure hams. These hams are\r\npumped in the shank only, and the growth of the ham-souring bacillus\r\nwithin the bodies of these hams is not interfered with until the curing\r\npickle has penetrated from the outside. As it requires several weeks\r\nfor the curing pickle to penetrate thoroughly into the deeper portions\r\nof these hams, the bacillus is thus afforded a considerable interval\r\nin which to develop before it is exposed to the inhibitory action of\r\nthe pickle. If these hams could be thoroughly pumped in the body at\r\nthe beginning of the cure in the same manner as the regular-cure hams,\r\nthe chief loss from ham souring would be eliminated. It would not do,\r\nhowever, to pump these hams in the body with the same pumping pickle\r\nused in the regular cure, as the meat would be rendered too salty and\r\nthe mild flavor of the ham would be lost. There is undoubtedly a demand\r\nfor mild-cure hams, otherwise they would not be on the market; and the\r\nquestion then arises how to pump these hams and still retain a mild\r\ncure. This might be accomplished by pumping these hams with their own\r\ncuring pickle, which is usually a milder pickle than that employed in\r\nthe regular cure, or an even milder pumping pickle might be used. If\r\nmild-cure hams were pumped in this way, the percentage of souring in\r\nthese hams could undoubtedly be greatly diminished without materially\r\naffecting the flavor of the ham.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate briefly, the prevention of ham souring is to be sought\r\nin two ways: (1) Through greater care in handling the hams and the\r\nadoption of precautionary measures to prevent the introduction of the\r\nham-souring bacillus into the bodies of the hams, and (2) through more\r\nthorough pumping of the deeper or inner portions of the hams, so as to\r\ncreate an unfavorable soil or medium in which the ham-souring bacillus\r\ncan not develop even if it should gain entrance into the bodies of the\r\nhams.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be apparent that ham souring can\r\nprobably never be entirely eliminated from the packing house under the\r\npresent methods of curing, but the adoption of precautionary measures\r\nin testing and pumping hams, together with a more thorough pumping\r\nof all hams in ways similar to those suggested, would unquestionably\r\nreduce very materially the losses from this source.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n1. In this paper it has been shown that ham souring, as encountered in\r\nthe wet cure where the hams are entirely submerged in pickling fluids,\r\nis due to the growth of an anaerobic bacillus within the bodies of the\r\nhams. This bacillus (_B. putrefaciens_) was found in sour hams obtained\r\nfrom four different packing establishments. It was isolated and grown\r\nin various laboratory media, in one of which, the egg-pork medium, it\r\ngave rise to the characteristic sour-ham odor. This bacillus was the\r\nonly organism that could be isolated from sour hams that was capable of\r\nproducing the characteristic sour-ham odor in the egg-pork medium.\r\n\r\n2. When injected into the bodies of sound hams, the bacillus caused\r\nthese hams to sour in the process of curing. In hams which had been\r\ninoculated with the bacillus and thus artificially soured, the bacillus\r\nwas recovered in cultures taken at points far removed, relatively\r\nspeaking, from the point of inoculation, indicating that the bacillus\r\nhad multiplied and progressed by extension throughout the bodies of the\r\nhams.\r\n\r\n3. The bacillus possesses no motility, and its extension throughout\r\nthe bodies of the hams is a result of multiplication. In its growth it\r\nfollows along the connective-tissue bands between the muscle bundles,\r\nwhich are composed of comparatively loose tissue and afford paths of\r\nleast resistance. When it invades the muscle tissue proper, it follows\r\nalong the sarcolemma sheaths between the muscle fibers. As a result of\r\nthis growth the muscular tissue becomes softer and tends to break more\r\neasily.\r\n\r\n4. The bacillus belongs to the class of putrefactive anaerobes which\r\nare widely distributed in nature in dust, soil, and excrementitious\r\nmatters. The bacillus or its spores is present in the dust and dirt\r\nof packing houses and finds its way into the hams in the various\r\nmanipulations to which they are subjected.\r\n\r\n5. The bacillus or its spores may be introduced into hams on the\r\nthermometers used in testing the hams, on the pumping needles, and\r\npossibly on the billhooks used in handling the hams. It may also be\r\ncarried into the hams in the pumping pickle, and may even find its way\r\ninto the hams from the curing pickle, although infection through the\r\nlatter channel probably does not often occur.\r\n\r\n6. The bacillus develops in the deeper portions of the ham because of\r\nthe anaerobic conditions there prevailing, and souring is most often\r\nencountered, therefore, in the deeper portions of the ham near the\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n7. A preliminary study of the chemical changes which take place in\r\nthe process of souring shows that these changes are of a putrefactive\r\nnature, and ham souring, as ordinarily encountered, is to be regarded\r\nas an incipient putrefaction. Hams which had been artificially soured\r\nby injections of culture were compared with sour hams obtained from the\r\npacking house, and the putrefactive changes were found to be identical.\r\n\r\n8. Hams which have once become sour can never be restored to a sound\r\ncondition, because of the chemical changes which result from the growth\r\nof the bacillus. In other words, the tissues of the ham undergo certain\r\nchemical changes in the process of souring, and when these changes\r\nhave once taken place the tissues can never be restored to a sound\r\ncondition. The repumping of slightly soured hams with a strong pumping\r\npickle will check further souring, by inhibiting the growth of the\r\nbacillus, but will not restore to a sound condition those portions of\r\nthe ham which have become sour.\r\n\r\n9. The salts of the pickling fluids have a marked inhibitory action\r\non the ham-souring bacillus, and sours occur less frequently in\r\nregular-cure hams.\r\n\r\n10. In regular-cure hams the growth of the ham-souring bacillus is\r\nrestricted and often completely inhibited as a result of the additional\r\npumping which these hams receive, whereby they are more or less\r\nsaturated with pickle at the beginning of the cure.\r\n\r\n11. If the pumping of regular-cure hams were more thorough and all\r\nof the deeper portions of the ham were thoroughly saturated with the\r\npumping pickle, souring could be largely eliminated if not entirely\r\nprevented in the hams, as an unfavorable medium or soil would thus\r\nbe created, in which the ham-souring bacillus could not develop. The\r\nreason that souring does develop in regular-cure hams is because the\r\npumping is not always thorough and there are certain areas in the\r\ndeeper portions of these hams which are not saturated with the pumping\r\npickle.\r\n\r\n12. Under the present methods of curing, the partly pumped or mild-cure\r\nhams furnish the greater proportion of the sours, as these hams are not\r\npumped in the body and the growth of the ham-souring bacillus within\r\nthe bodies of these hams is not interfered with until the curing pickle\r\nhas penetrated from the outside. As it requires several weeks for the\r\ncuring pickle to penetrate thoroughly into the deeper portions of these\r\nhams, the bacillus is thus afforded a considerable interval in which to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n13. The percentage of souring in the mild-cure hams could be greatly\r\nreduced without materially affecting the cure by pumping these hams\r\nwith their own curing pickle, which is usually a milder pickle than\r\nthat employed in the regular cure; and if the pumping were thorough\r\nthe number of sours in these hams could be reduced to a small figure.\r\n\r\n14. The only way by which ham souring could be entirely eliminated from\r\nthe larger packing establishments under the present methods of curing\r\nwould be to handle the hams throughout under aseptic conditions, and\r\nthis, for obvious reasons, would be an impossibility. The losses from\r\nham souring may be materially reduced, however, by greater care in\r\nhandling the hams and the adoption of precautionary measures designed\r\nto prevent the introduction of contaminated foreign matter into the\r\nbodies of the hams, together with more thorough methods of pumping.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the writer desires to express his obligations to Dr. S.\r\nE. Bennett, of the Inspection Division, inspector in charge at Chicago,\r\nfor the assignment of trained meat inspectors to assist in the work,\r\nas well as for kind assistance in obtaining data and material for\r\nlaboratory study, and to Dr. L. E. Day, of the Pathological Division,\r\nwho kindly prepared the sections which are figured and described in the\r\npresent article.",
