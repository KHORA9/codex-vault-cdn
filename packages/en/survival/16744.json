And retained it through all\r\nthese years.\r\n\r\nIt was the constant aim and effort of those who founded this business,\r\nand of those who have carried out the founders' work to the present, to\r\nanticipate the needs of the industry, to co-operate with the individuals\r\nin it, to show their vital interest in the success of their customers.\r\n\r\nThese principles of business practice won the good will that established\r\nthis company as the authority in its important field.\r\n\r\nOur future success depends upon the continuance of that good will. Our\r\nappreciation of that fact is your best assurance that in the future the\r\nservices of this company, as well as the superiority of its products,\r\nwill justify the confidence and good will of the thousands to whom the\r\nname of _Pratt_ is but another name for _Quality_ and _Service_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~PROFITABLE LIVESTOCK~\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farm Animals]\r\n\r\n\r\n~INTRODUCTION~\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal husbandry is the sure foundation of profitable, permanent\r\nagriculture. Where many animals are kept and their manure properly cared\r\nfor and returned to the land, the soil becomes richer and\r\ncrop-production steadily increases. And the farmer grows rich with his\r\nland.\r\n\r\nFurther, the keeping of live stock distributes the farm labor and the\r\nfarm income over the entire year. This is true whether meat, milk or\r\neggs are the money crops. And certainly both factors are worthy of\r\nconsideration from a straight business standpoint. With labor as\r\nvaluable as it is at present, lost time cuts into the profits. And when\r\nthe income is regular, not concentrated in a short period or dependent\r\nupon the success of a single crop, the matter of farm finance is much\r\nsimplified.\r\n\r\nConsider the richest and most desirable agricultural sections of our\r\ngreat land. With very few exceptions, the best and most valuable farms\r\nare those which are heavily stocked with domestic animals. Here, too,\r\nare found the finest farm homes, the most prosperous and contented farm\r\nfamilies. And this fact, which is so well established that it requires\r\nno argument, plainly shows that _animal husbandry pays_.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages you will find much valuable information\r\nregarding the proper care--in health and sickness--of horses, cattle,\r\nswine, sheep and poultry.\r\n\r\nWe trust, and believe that you will find it most helpful in connection\r\nwith your work. That it will enable you to be more successful, earn\r\nbigger profits.\r\n\r\nRight at the start we wish to emphasize two facts which are really\r\nfundamental and which are recognized by the most successful stock\r\nkeepers. The first is this: It does not pay to keep scrub stock, animals\r\nwhich cannot under any conditions give the big returns. The second: No\r\nanimal, regardless of breeding, can do its best work unless it is kept\r\nin perfect physical condition.\r\n\r\nThe selection of your animals is up to you. Get good ones. Than _keep\r\nthem good_ and _make them better_. The Pratt line of stock and poultry\r\npreparations, regulators, tonics, disinfectants and remedies, will help\r\nyou greatly. Made for nearly fifty years by America's pioneer concern in\r\nthis line, each article is the best of its kind, each is backed by this\r\nsquare-deal guarantee--\"Your Money Back If You Are Not Satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n                         PRATT FOOD COMPANY\r\n\r\n               Philadelphia      Chicago      Toronto\r\n\r\n                        ~THE PRATT GUARANTEE~\r\n\r\n              \"~Your Money Back If YOU Are Not Satisfied~\"\r\n\r\nThe Pratt Food Company believes in fair play. We desire that our\r\nmillions of customers _shall receive full value_ for every cent they\r\nspend in purchasing our goods. And to that end we spare no expense in\r\nmaking each article in the Pratt Line just as good, just as efficient,\r\nas is humanly possible.\r\n\r\nMore than that, we wish each customer to be _completely satisfied_. If\r\nfor any reason any article bearing the Pratt trade-mark fails to give\r\nsuch satisfaction, the full purchase price will be refunded on demand by\r\nthe dealer who made the sale.\r\n\r\nYou can buy and use Pratts Stock and Poultry Preparations with fullest\r\nconfidence because you are protected by\r\n\r\n      ~The Guarantee That Has Stood For Nearly Fifty Years~\r\n\r\n               Copyright, 1919, by Pratt Food Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~PRATTS PRACTICAL POINTERS~\r\n\r\n\r\n~HORSES~\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the automobile and the tractor are now doing much of the work\r\nformerly done by horses, the \"horseless era\" is still far off. A good\r\nhorse will always be worth good money, will always be a desirable and\r\nprofitable member of the farm family. But the undersized no-breed\r\nspecimen will be even less valuable in the future than in the past.\r\n\r\nThe great demand for horses for army use and the high prices paid by the\r\nGovernment, tempted horse breeders and farmers to dispose of the fine\r\nspecimens which alone met the exacting requirements of army buyers. It\r\nwill take years to make good this tremendous wastage of horse flesh. But\r\nthis is a big opportunity for breeders of good horses and we may expect\r\nthem to make the most of it.\r\n\r\nPrices of really desirable horses are now high. If you have a good one,\r\ntake good care of him. Protect his health, lengthen his life. If you\r\nmust buy, be sure that you get a sound animal which will serve you long\r\nand faithfully.\r\n\r\nSee the horse in his stall. If he has a spavin he will hop on one leg\r\nwhen made to \"get over,\" or jerk it up as he backs out if he is affected\r\nwith chorea (St. Vitus' dance). In the latter disease the tail is\r\nsuddenly raised and quivers when the animal backs out of stall. Watch to\r\nsee if the horse \"cribs\" and \"sucks wind\": also that he is not vicious\r\nin the stall. Stand him at rest on a level floor before exercise. If he\r\nis lame he will rest the sore foot.\r\n\r\nExamine both sides of the horse. The dealer may stand the \"bad side\"\r\nnext to a wall. Pick up each foot in turn. Suspect something wrong if he\r\nwears bar shoes, special shape shoes, leather soles or rubber pads.\r\nRemove all such things and examine carefully before buying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~PERCHERON HORSE~]\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Englewood, Colo.\r\n\r\n      I have had many dealings with rundown horses, both in the draft\r\n      and hot blood classes, and Pratts goods have always brought them\r\n      out on top.\r\n\r\n     JAS. S. KINSLEY, JR._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nReject for contracted feet, steep heels, shrunken frogs and bars,\r\ndropped soles, corns, quarter cracks and signs of founder. See that hoof\r\ndressing does not cover evidences of un-soundness. Following bad\r\nattacks of founder the hoof grows out long at the toes, shows marked\r\ngrooves and ridges, is convex at the points of the frogs, and the horse\r\ntends to thrust his forefeet out in front when standing and walks and\r\ntrots on his heels. Ringbones are indicated by hard bony enlargements on\r\nthe pastern; side-bones, by similar enlargements at the quarters just\r\nabove juncture of horn and hair. Examine front of knees for scars\r\nindicating results of stumbling and falling. Similar scars on the inside\r\nof knees and fetlocks indicate objectionable cutting and interfering.\r\nShoulders and hips should be smooth, well covered, and free from tumors\r\nor sores. No sores should be seen on back or top of neck under collar.\r\n\r\nExamine teeth for age and soundness. See that eyes are of like color,\r\nare sound, and the eyelids whole.\r\n\r\nThe horse should allow one to examine his ears, and should neither hold\r\nthem absolutely still nor keep them constantly moving. Still ears may\r\nindicate deafness; restless ones, poor eyesight or nervousness.\r\n\r\nSee that the horse goes sound and does not \"roar\" when galloped. Give\r\nhim all the water he will drink before testing for \"wind.\" It will bring\r\nout the characteristic symptoms of \"heaves\" if he has been \"doped.\"\r\nHeaves is indicated by labored bellows-like action of the abdominal\r\nmuscles when breathing. Examine the nostrils, as sponges or squeezed\r\nlemons may have been inserted to hide roaring.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Madison, Wis.\r\n\r\n      I think every man that owns horses should have Pratts Animal\r\n      Regulator on hand. I am a teamster and find it of great benefit to\r\n      my horses, whether run down or not.\r\n\r\n      HARRY E. BURMEISTER_\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~CLYDESDALE HORSE~]\r\n\r\nA spavined horse starts out lame for a few steps or rods and then goes\r\nsound. A lame shoulder causes dragging of the toe and rolling when in\r\nmotion. A ring-bone causes an extra long step and lameness increases\r\nwith exercise. Stifle lameness causes walking on the heels of shoe and\r\nconsequent wearing of the iron. Hip lameness causes outward rolling of\r\nthe leg in trotting, and wasting of the muscles of stifle and hip leads\r\nto a characteristic drop. See that the horse's tail is sound, has not\r\nbeen joined on and is free from sores, tumors or evidences of recent\r\ndocking. Always remember to back the horse up as well as drive or ride\r\nhim and see that he is not only sound and gentle but suitable for the\r\nspecial work he will be required to do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Care of the Horse]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Care of the Horse~\r\n\r\nA grown work horse requires daily about one pound of grain (concentrate)\r\nfor each hundred pounds of live weight. Of hay he will need a slightly\r\nlarger amount or about fourteen to eighteen pounds a day, according to\r\nsize, weight, and character of work done. The idle horse will do well on\r\nless grain and more roughage.\r\n\r\nFor a farm horse, 10 pounds of oats, 5 pounds of corn, and 3 pounds of\r\nbran, divided into three equal feeds, will make a suitable ration for\r\none day.\r\n\r\nThe corn may be fed at noon to give variety. For the evening meal\r\ncrushed oats, bran, and a few handfuls of cut hay, wetted and salted,\r\nwill be relished. The bulk of the hay should be fed at night, and but\r\ntwo or three pounds of it at noon, during hot weather. Avoid dusty hay.\r\nClover hay is apt to be moldy. It is suitable food for work horses, or\r\nidle drafters, if sound and not too liberally fed. Increase the corn in\r\ncold weather. Omit it in hot weather entirely. Alfalfa is of high\r\nfeeding value, but if moldy, or fed as a well-nigh exclusive ration, is\r\napt to affect the kidneys injuriously. It is deemed unsafe food for\r\nstallions, as it is said to induce impotence or sterility.\r\n\r\nHorses should drink _before_ they eat, unless they have ready access to\r\nfresh water. It is best to allow drinking water often in small\r\nquantities, even if the horse is hot. So used it will not hurt him. The\r\nhorse's stomach holds three and one-half gallons. Water flows through\r\nthe stomach along seventy or more feet of small intestine, into the\r\n\"waterbag.\" Hay is not digested to any extent in the stomach. That organ\r\ncares for the concentrated food. Theoretically, a horse should drink\r\nfirst, then eat hay, then grain. Practically no great amount of water\r\nshould be taken just after a meal as it tends to flush undigested food\r\nout of the stomach; nor should it be given soon after a meal.\r\n\r\nAll stables, pens, out houses, poultry houses and yards should be\r\nregularly disinfected every week; nothing better can be used than Pratts\r\nDip and Disinfectant.\r\n\r\nThis preparation is entirely free from all dangerous substances,\r\narsenic, mercury, etc., but full of medicinal qualities and properties\r\nwhich make it most effective without the dangerous results which are\r\nexperienced with many other preparations, such as carbolic acid, etc. It\r\nkills disease germs and prevents contagious diseases from spreading.\r\n\r\nFarm horses do not need blanketing in the stable under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. A thin sheet in the stable keeps off flies and dust and\r\nis necessary. Pratts Fly Chaser is a proved and safe fly repellant. It\r\ndoes not gum the hair. Its efficiency is unequalled.\r\n\r\nIf a horse sweats under the blanket, uncover his rear parts. Always tuck\r\nthe blanket about a horse's chest when standing on the street in\r\ninclement weather or when cooling off. Rubber loin covers, used on\r\ncarriage horses in wet weather, should be perforated. In the spring, the\r\namount of Pratts Animal Regulator given should be somewhat increased.\r\nThis will put the horse into condition in much less time, and be of\r\ngreat assistance in helping to shed readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Winthrop, N.Y.\r\n\r\n      I have used Pratts Animal Regulator for the past three years and\r\n      have found it very successful with both horses and hogs._\r\n\r\n      THOS.

It is a thin\r\nmass of horn overlying and intimately attached to a sensitive, blood and\r\nnerve-endowed tissue called the \"quick\" which is capable of suffering\r\nexcruciating agony.\r\n\r\nThe slices should be made to fit the hoof and need to be reset once a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe permanent teeth are forty--twenty-four grinders, twelve front teeth\r\nand four tusks, except in mares, which seldom have tusks. The age of a\r\nhorse can be told more or less accurately by the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are liable to disease and should be closely watched.\r\n\r\nBad teeth are often an unsuspected cause of indigestion, loss of\r\ncondition, bad coat, slobbering and other troubles which puzzle the\r\nowner. Horses very often have decayed teeth, and suffer with toothache.\r\nThese teeth should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Horse Diseases~\r\n\r\nIf horses and cattle were left free to roam as Nature intended, many of\r\ntheir present-day ailments would be unknown. Man has taken these animals\r\nfrom Nature's broad garden, and confined them to the narrow limits of\r\nstable and stall. No longer can they seek out and instinctively find\r\njust those roots, herbs, seeds, and barks which their systems demand.\r\n\r\nThis explains why Pratts Animal Regulator has been used by successful\r\nhorsemen for nearly a half century, as it is largely composed of these\r\nsame vegetable ingredients from Nature's garden.\r\n\r\nMerit and quality count, and while hosts of imitators have sprung up,\r\nnone have ever come near equalling our product. Pratts Animal Regulator\r\nrestores to the animals their natural constitutions and functions,\r\nsupplying just that which they formerly had, but now lack. While not a\r\ncure for every disease, it is a positive preventive of the most common\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nIt aids digestion and insures the animal receiving full benefit of its\r\nfood; purifies the blood and keeps the bowels free and regular. After\r\nyou have accomplished these three things, you need not fear disease in\r\nthe shape of colic, bloat, heaves, hide-bound, distemper, constipation,\r\nworms, and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n     _I shall be pleased to recommend Pratts Animal Regulator always, as\r\n     my horse has gained in strength and weight and is looking fine,\r\n     always having a glossy coat. He works hard every day in the dray\r\n     business._\r\n\r\n     _H.G. AMERINE._\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n~Barb-Wire Cuts~\r\n\r\nClean with soap and water, and apply Pratts Healing Ointment or Pratts\r\nHealing Powder. These remedies heal naturally and leave no dangerous\r\nscar.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Colds~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A dull appearance of the horse, rough coat; the body will\r\nbe hot in parts and cold in others; running of the eyes and a discharge\r\nfrom the nose.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Keep the horse warm and free from draughts; use nose bag\r\nand give Pratts Heave, Cough and Cold Remedy according to directions. It\r\nnever fails. Give nourishing feed and bran mashes and Pratts Animal\r\nRegulator daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Colic~\r\n\r\nCommon causes of colic are sudden changes of food; feeding too much or\r\ntoo seldom; feeding when the horse is hot and tired; watering or working\r\ntoo soon after a meal; feeding new oats, or new hay, or grass; or, in\r\nshort, anything that is apt to derange digestion. There are various\r\nforms of colic. In cramp (spasmodic) colic, pains come and go and the\r\nhorse rolls violently and fearlessly. In wind (flatulent) colic there is\r\nbloating of the right flank and the horse lies down, rolls without\r\nviolence, breathes with difficulty, paws, looks around at his sides and\r\nfinds no relief. In bloat of the stomach, gas and fluid gush back and\r\nforth from the stomach to the throat; flanks may not show bloat; pain is\r\nsteady but not violent; horse sweats; nostrils flap; pulse is fast and\r\nweak; countenance is haggard and anxious. In enteritis (inflammation of\r\nthe bowels) pain is constant and severe; the horse makes frequent\r\nattempts to lie down but is afraid to do so; pulse and temperature run\r\nhigh; membranes of eyelids, nostrils, and mouth are red; bowels and\r\nbladder do not act; horse may walk persistently in a circle. In\r\nimpaction of the bowels, pains are comparatively mild or fugitive; horse\r\nis restless, paws often, strains and passes no manure, or only a few\r\nballs covered with slime and streaks of white mucus. In gut-tie, hernia,\r\nand other absolute stoppage of the bowels, symptoms of enteritis are\r\ncommon and the horse may, when down, strain and then sit on his\r\nhaunches. The latter condition, and enteritis, usually prove fatal. Wind\r\ncolic may need prompt use of the trocar and cannula to puncture high up\r\nin the right flank for liberation of gas. In impaction, raw linseed oil\r\nshould be freely given in repeated doses of one pint, and rectal\r\ninjections of soapy warm water and glycerine will help. No irritants\r\nshould be inserted in the vagina or sheath in any form of colic.\r\nStoppage of urine is a result of pain, not the cause of colic. The urine\r\nwill come when the pain subsides. A good all-around colic remedy will be\r\nfound in Pratts Veterinary Colic Remedy. It is compounded from the\r\nprescription of a qualified veterinarian and has a record of curing 998\r\ncases out of 1,000 treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Constipation~\r\n\r\nAll horses should be given a warm bran mash weekly and Pratts Animal\r\nRegulator daily, and constipation will be unknown. Constipation is often\r\nthe cause of hide bound, rough coat and loss of flesh. Give a good\r\nphysic of linseed oil, aloes or cantor oil, and use the Regulator\r\nmentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Coughs~\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Chronic coughs are the result of distemper, sore throat, a\r\nneglected cold, catarrh or dusty hay, and frequently turn into heaves,\r\nbronchitis, etc.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give only the best and most nourishing foods, dampened.\r\nKeep horse warm, and blanketed in a well ventilated stable.\r\n\r\nIf there is a swelling of the throat it should be blistered with Pratts\r\nLiniment, or Pratts Spavin Paste--A Blister. Use Pratts Heave, Cough and\r\nCold Remedy according to directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Diarrhoea~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--At first it resembles colic, and will be followed by\r\nviolent diarrhoea; the discharge soon becomes merely discolored water\r\nand smells bad; the horse is very thirsty, the pulse thick and feeble,\r\nthe heart skips its beats, the position of the horse is something like\r\ncolic, and he sweats freely.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--From diseased condition of teeth, eating rich, juicy food,\r\ndrinking impure water or from overdose of physic.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the diarrhoea is severe, call a veterinarian. During\r\nand after recovery pay attention to the food. Avoid bran mashes. Much\r\ndepends on the care at this time, and the constant using of Pratts\r\nAnimal Regulator, with all feed, during his recovery. Feed lightly for\r\nfirst two or three days.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Distemper~\r\n\r\nDistemper and Pink Eye are closely related and one is often mistaken for\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nIt usually affects colts between the ages of three and five years. If a\r\nhorse is once afflicted it is immune from a second attack. The feature\r\nof distemper is the swelling under the jaw, the size indicating the\r\nseverity of the case. The animal is dull; the head has a \"poked-out\"\r\nappearance; coughs; no appetite; feet are cold; saliva runs from its\r\nmouth; has catarrhal symptoms and difficulty in swallowing; the name\r\n\"strangles\" is often applied to it. When this swelling forms on the\r\nlungs, liver, etc., the case is aggravated and difficult to cure.\r\n\r\nDistemper is contagious. It may occur at any time, but is most prevalent\r\nfrom September to April.\r\n\r\nPratts Distemper and Pink Eye Remedy will positively relieve the disease\r\nat once. Blanket the horse and keep in a well-ventilated stable, free\r\nfrom draughts. Give cold water frequently in small quantities and feed\r\nwith whatever he will eat. When an abscess forms on the outside and\r\nbecomes soft, it should be opened and the soft parts surrounding it\r\npoulticed so that there will be no \"bunch\" left after it heals.\r\nDisinfect stable with Pratts Dip and Disinfectant.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Founder or Laminitis~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--An inflammation of the entire foot which causes such\r\nintense pain that the animal cannot stand. The pulse is strong, thick\r\nand throbbing, and the horse lies down with legs stretched out.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Over-exertion, or after-effects from chilling, inflammation of\r\nthe lungs, bowels or mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n     _Frankford, Pa.\r\n\r\n      I doctored a very lame horse with Pratts Liniment after trying\r\n      other treatment for months. In a couple of days the lameness left\r\n      and we used him every day till he died of old age._\r\n\r\n      ARTHUR C. SHIMEL_\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Remove the shoe, and soak the feet in warm water for six\r\nor eight hours and repeat in two or three days. Also apply Pratts\r\nPeerless Hoof Ointment at night all over the bottom of the foot and to\r\nall parts of the frog and at top of hoof joining the hair, and cover the\r\nentire wall of the foot. The horse should stand on a deep, soft bed.\r\nCover with blankets. Feed bran mashes, vegetables and hay; no grain. Use\r\nwide-webbed shoes two weeks after recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Heaves~\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of this disease are chronic, spasmodic cough and\r\nsimultaneous passage of gas from the rectum; double bellowslike action\r\nof the abdominal muscles in breathing; harsh staring coat; hide-bound\r\nskin; weakness, and ill-health in general. Over-burdening of the stomach\r\nwith coarse, bulky, dusty, or woody hay or other roughage, and working\r\nthe horse immediately after such a meal induces heaves. The horse that\r\nhas inherited a gluttonous appetite is especially subject to the\r\ndisease. Probably the most effective remedy for this disease is Pratts\r\nHeave Remedy. In addition to using the Remedy as directed, we would\r\nsuggest wetting all food with lime water, feeding wet oat straw in\r\nwinter and grass in summer in preference to hay; allowing double the\r\ncustomary rest period after meals and keeping the bowels freely open by\r\nfeeding bran mashes containing raw linseed oil or flaxseed meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Itch~\r\n\r\nThis is the name given to mange, eczema and other skin diseases. It is\r\nusually prevalent in summer and from a small beginning on an animal,\r\nwill rapidly spread all over the body.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash the parts thoroughly with a solution of one part of\r\nPratts Disinfectant to 20 parts water. Let it dry and then apply Pratts\r\nHealing Ointment or Healing Powder two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Lice~\r\n\r\nSprinkle Pratts Disinfectant on an old blanket and tie it around the\r\nanimal for two or three hours. This will quickly kill all vermin. Spray\r\nlightly upon the legs and such places that the blanket will not cover.\r\nThen spray thoroughly the stable and all poultry houses near with the\r\nDisinfectant, according to directions. Give Pratts Animal Regulator to\r\nbuild up the animals that have been affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Puncture and Wounds in the Foot~\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the opening or puncture in the hoof must be made larger,\r\nso as to give free vent for the matter which is sure to form. If this is\r\nnot done, quittor will follow. Then dress with Pratts Peerless Hoof\r\nOintment.\r\n\r\nWhile working the horse, a pledget of tow, covered with Pratts Peerless\r\nHoof Ointment, may be placed in and over the puncture and confined; but\r\nit must not be allowed to remain after the horse returns to the stable.\r\nSoak the feet for eight or ten hours a day for two or three days in a 5%\r\nsolution of Pratts Disinfectant and apply the Ointment. Horse will not\r\nhave proud flesh when this remedy is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Quarter Cracks~\r\n\r\nCut top of hoof above the crack deep enough to draw blood. Soak foot in\r\nhot water, apply Pratts Peerless Hoof Ointment and cover with oakum.\r\nPare out sole and open heel--blacksmith must use care in expanding.\r\nApply Pratts Peerless Hoof Ointment daily to the coronet and frogs--this\r\nis very important. Use bar shoe.\r\n\r\n~Thin Flesh~\r\n\r\nAnimal needs a good tonic. Use Pratts Animal Regulator daily with the\r\nfeed according to directions. This is a regulator, tonic and digestive\r\nand so works upon the blood, liver, bowels and digestive organs that the\r\nanimal is quickly built up, and is given strength, health and flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Thrush~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Shown by a foul discharge issuing from the cleft of the\r\nfoot, and usually attended with decay of the horn and a vile odor. The\r\nfoot is hot and hard.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--In the fore feet, it is generally the result of navicular\r\ndisease or contraction of the feet. In the hind feet it is entirely\r\ncaused by filthy stables, allowing the feet to stand in decaying manure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Have absolute cleanliness in the stable and stalls,\r\ndisinfecting with Pratts Disinfectant. Wash the foot thoroughly with\r\nsoap and water, and cut away all diseased and ragged parts as well as\r\nthe white, powdery decayed horn and substance, even if the flesh is\r\nexposed and the frog much reduced. Then pour Pratts Liniment over the\r\naffected parts. Dress daily until cured. Another excellent remedy is to\r\nwash out diseased portion of hoof with one part Pratts Disinfectant and\r\n20 parts of water three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Worms~\r\n\r\nHorses take in worm eggs on pasture, in hay, and in drinking water from\r\ncontaminated troughs or ponds. Marsh or swale hay is particularly liable\r\nto infest with worms. Avoid sources of worms. Cleanliness is imperative.\r\n\r\nCut down feed one-half, mix bran with feed and dampen it. Give one dose\r\nof Pratts Specially Prepared Worm Powder with the feed twice a day for\r\nfour days. After fourth day give large, soft, well-scalded bran mash to\r\nloosen bowels freely. Repeat the bran mashes if necessary, as the bowels\r\nmust be moved freely. Should the horse refuse to eat the bran mash, it\r\nwill be necessary to give him a dose of Glauber's salts, or some other\r\npurge to loosen the bowels.\r\n\r\n_Pin Worms._--Sometimes pin worms remain just inside the rectum, and are\r\nvery hard and stubborn to cure. In cases of this kind, if the desired\r\nresult is not obtained by feeding Pratts Worm Powder, dissolve one of\r\nthe powders in a quart of water and inject in the rectum. Repeat this\r\nonce a day in the evening, and continue for four or five days. Do not\r\nfail in this case, as in all other cases of worms, to feed bran mashes\r\nuntil the bowels are freely moved, and should the horse refuse the bran\r\nmash or should it fail to move the bowels, give the horse a dose of\r\nGlauber's salts.\r\n\r\nPratts Worm Powder is a special preparation for the destruction of all\r\nkinds of worms in horses, hogs, and sheep. It is purely vegetable, has a\r\nstrong tonic effect that builds up and helps the animal to regain\r\nstrength, and is the quickest and most thorough worm destroyer on the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n\r\n     +-------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n     |~Every PRATT PREPARATION is sold with a positive and absolute|\r\n     |GUARANTEE--\"Your Money Back If You Are Not Satisfied.\"~      |\r\n     +-------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Care of Cows]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~CATTLE~\r\n\r\n\r\nCows will bring large or small profits in proportion to the care they\r\nreceive. If properly housed, properly fed, properly bred, and properly\r\nprotected against disease they will fully repay the little extra\r\nattention required. Strive intelligently to secure the greatest possible\r\nregular production. Keep a sharp lookout for unfavorable symptoms and be\r\nprompt in finding a cause for poor condition and remedying it. Cows kept\r\nin perfect health are the least expense, least trouble, and the greatest\r\nprofit-earners.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to be a veterinarian to know that the health of a cow\r\ndepends on a good healthy appetite with complete digestion and perfect\r\nassimilation of the daily ration.\r\n\r\nThat is just plain common sense. No cow which is not a big eater can be\r\nprofitable. But appetite is not of itself sufficient to make a cow a\r\nmoney maker. There must be sound digestion.\r\n\r\nOnce establish and maintain good digestion, food performs its natural\r\nfunctions. Bodily waste is repaired. Strength and growth are noticed and\r\nthe cow gives the utmost possible amount of milk. See then, that your\r\ncows have hearty, healthy appetites and good digestion. Good digestion\r\ndoes not always follow a large appetite. A cow giving only a few quarts\r\nof milk a day will often eat as much as one giving gallons. She requires\r\nthe same amount of care and attention.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that she does not have good digestion to convert food\r\ninto milk. Of course there are cows which will always be small milkers,\r\nbut there are many many more cows which can be made to give substantial,\r\npaying increase of milk production if proper attention is given them.\r\nPerhaps there are such cows in your herd. Without your even realizing\r\nit, they are out of condition. A little help and they would give enough\r\nmore milk to pay you a satisfactory profit.\r\n\r\nThis \"help\" can easily be given. Your own dealer has it. We mean Pratts\r\nCow Remedy, for cows only.\r\n\r\nWe all know how, when we are well, the sight or smell of pleasant\r\ntasting food, \"makes the mouth water.\" This is literally true because\r\nthe digestive glands of the mouth and stomach pour out their secretions\r\nand are ready to begin digesting the food.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the nerves fail to send their messages to the glands or\r\nthe glands fail to respond, we have a diseased condition and we take\r\nmedicine to assist in recovery.\r\n\r\nThus the sensation known as appetite is really at the basis of sound\r\nhealth. Without it, it is doubtful if animals would eat enough to supply\r\ntheir bodily needs.\r\n\r\nThe mere forcing of food into the stomach would avail little. There must\r\nbe desire for food, and restoring the appetite is the first step in\r\nbringing the health back. In other words an appetizer is often required\r\nto induce us to eat. Then thorough digestion builds up bodily strength.\r\n\r\nPratts Cow Remedy does all this for the cow, assisting Nature in\r\nbringing up the appetite, stimulating digestion, restoring and\r\nmaintaining health.\r\n\r\nCattle is generally divided into dairy, beef and dual purpose breeds.\r\nThe names signify the advantages claimed for them. In the dairy breeds,\r\nthe Holstein, Jersey, Guernseys, French Canadian and Ayrshire are\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nShorthorns, Herefords, Polled Durhams are the best-known beef breeds.\r\n\r\nWhile among the dual purpose breeds, Milking Shorthorns, Red Polls,\r\nBrown Swiss and Devons have many admirers.\r\n\r\nThe indications when selecting dairy females, and important in the order\r\ngiven, are: (1) Much length or depth in the barrel or coupling,\r\nindicating a large possible consumption and utilization of food. (2)\r\nRefinement of form, as evidenced more particularly in the head, neck,\r\nwithers, thighs, and limbs. (3) Good development of udder and milk\r\nveins.

(5) Downward and yet outward spring and open-spaced ribs,\r\ncovered with a soft, pliable and elastic skin.\r\n\r\nThe essential indications of correct form in beef cattle are: (1) A\r\ncompact form wide and deep throughout, and but moderately long in the\r\ncoupling. (2) A good back, wide from neck to tail, well fleshed, and\r\nstraight. (3) A good front quarter, wide, deep, and full. (4) A good\r\nhind quarter, long, wide, and deep. (5) Good handling qualities, as\r\nindicated in elastic flesh and pliant skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~GUERNSEY COW~]\r\n\r\nThe important indications of good form in dual females are: (1) Medium\r\nto large size for the breed or grade. (2) Good length and depth in the\r\ncoupling. (3) Good development of udder and milk veins. (4) Good\r\nconstitution, as indicated by good width through the heart. (5) Head and\r\nneck inclining to long and fine. (6) Ribs of medium spring, open spaced,\r\nand covered with a good handling skin. The dual types have an absence of\r\nextreme development in the direction of either the dairy or the beef\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIn males selected for breeding, the evidences of masculinity should be\r\nmarkedly present. These include increased strength as shown in the head,\r\nneck, breast, shoulders, back and limbs.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of having pure blood stock over \"scrubs\" is apparent. For\r\nthose, however, who want something better than scrubstock and cannot pay\r\nthe high price which pure blood commands, the ownership of grade cattle\r\noffers a satisfactory solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nGrading consists in mating thoroughbred sires with common females and\r\nwith the female progeny for a number of generations. Where the work is\r\nwisely done by the use of good sires, accompanied by the rejection of\r\nall inferior animals for future breeding, the progeny of beef sires may\r\nbe brought up to the level of the pure breed for beef making from which\r\nthe sires have been selected in four generations. To bring milking\r\nqualities up to the level may call for one or two more generations of\r\nsuch breeding. Not only do these grade animals answer almost equally\r\nwell, with pure breeds, but they may be bought for much less.\r\n\r\nIf cows are to produce a maximum return in milk, they must be kept in\r\ncomfort. In winter they are usually tied in the stall. The light should\r\nbe ample and the ventilation thorough. Lack of proper ventilation causes\r\nthe spread of tuberculosis in cattle.\r\n\r\nCows must be allowed exercise, even in winter.\r\n\r\nThey should be allowed to go out daily for an hour or more into a\r\nsheltered yard, save on days when the weather is extreme; or, better\r\nstill, be given the liberty of a closed and well-ventilated shed during\r\na portion of the day. It should be supplied with a fodder rack.\r\n\r\nIn summer, cows in milk must be protected from storms, from excessive\r\nsunshine, and from flies, as far as this may be practicable. Pratts Fly\r\nChaser is unequalled as a fly repellant. It is perfectly safe to use,\r\ndoes not injure or gum the hair, and is economical. A light spray is\r\nboth lasting and effective.\r\n\r\nCows in milk should be driven gently. The pasture should not be too\r\ndistant from the stable, and driving during the heat of the day should\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\nThe quality of milk is easily injured by coming in direct contact with\r\nforeign substances or by imbibing odors. The milk must be drawn from\r\nclean udders, with clean hands, into clean pails, and amid clean\r\nsurroundings. The stables must have attention. The udder and teats\r\nshould be wiped off by using a damp cloth. Milking should be done with\r\ndry hands into metal pails, kept clean by scalding. Milking before\r\nfeeding prevents dust particles from getting into the milk. Noxious\r\nodors are kept down by the prompt removal of droppings and by strewing\r\nsand, plaster, rock phosphate, or dry earth in the manure gutters.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Elderton, Pa.\r\n\r\n     \"I have used Pratts Cow Remedy with best results. I fully believe\r\n     it cannot be surpassed for increasing the flow of milk.\"\r\n\r\n     JAS. YOUNG._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless milking is done at stated times, and by the same person, there\r\nwill be a loss in the production. When milking is delayed, a decreased\r\nflow is noticeable the following morning. When a change of milkers is\r\nmade, some cows resent it by withholding a part of the milk.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to dry some dairy cows prior to the birth of the next\r\ncalf, and yet, as a rule, it ought to be done. When they are to be dried\r\nthe process should begin by milking them once a day and putting them on\r\ndry food. The food may also be reduced somewhat in quantity. Later the\r\nmilk is taken out at intervals which constantly increase in length until\r\nthe cow is dry. The udder should be carefully watched during the later\r\nstages of the drying process.\r\n\r\nWhere suitable pasture may be obtained, it is usually a cheaper source\r\nof food for cows than soiling food or cured fodders, as the element of\r\nlabor in giving the food is largely eliminated. The best pastures,\r\nviewed from the standpoint of production, are those grown on lands that\r\nmay be irrigated during the season of growth. These consist of clover\r\nand certain grasses. Permanent pastures which are grown on moist land,\r\nand which contain a number of grasses, are usually satisfactory, but the\r\nnature of the pasture must, of course, be largely determined by the\r\nattendant conditions. Blue grass pastures are excellent while succulent\r\nand abundant, but in midsummer they lose their succulence for weeks in\r\nsuccession. Brouer grass is a favorite pasture in northwestern areas,\r\nand Bermuda grass in the South. In the Eastern and Central States, the\r\nmost suitable pastures are made up of blue grass, timothy, and orchard\r\ngrass, and of the common red, white and alsike clovers.\r\n\r\nThere is more or less of hazard to cows when grazing on\r\nalfalfa--liability to bloating, which may result fatally. Likewise\r\nsecond growth sorghum or the second growth of the non-saccharine\r\nsorghums is full of hazard, especially in dry seasons when it has become\r\nstunted in growth. Nor should rape and rye be grazed, save for a short\r\ntime after the cows have been milked, lest they give a taint to the\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\nThe change from winter rations to grazing should never be suddenly made,\r\nor purging caused by the fresh grass will lead to loss in weight and\r\nloss of milk, though at first there will probably be an advance in the\r\nsame. The change may be made in outline as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The cows will not be turned out until after the food given in the\r\nmorning has been sufficiently consumed.\r\n\r\n(2) They will be kept out an hour, or two the first day, and the time\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n(3) The time called for to effect the change should never be less than\r\none week or more than three.\r\n\r\n(4) As soon as the change begins, the reduction in succulent food,\r\nensilage, and field roots should also begin.\r\n\r\n(5) The dry fodder should be continued morning and evening as long as\r\nthe cows will take it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~AYRSHIRE COW~]\r\n\r\n(6) There should be some reduction and it may be modification in the\r\ngrain for a short time.\r\n\r\nAfter turning out a full supply may be necessary. Should the pasture be\r\ncomposed mainly of grasses, food rich in protein, as wheat bran, should\r\nbe fed, but if it is composed mainly of clover, then more carbonaceous\r\ngrain, as corn, should be fed.\r\n\r\nWhen pasture is succulent and abundant, it is a disputed point as to\r\nwhether it will pay to feed meal of any kind in addition. The following\r\nconclusion in regard to this question would seem safe:\r\n\r\nWhen cows are fed grain on pastures succulent and abundant, the tendency\r\nis to increase the yield in the milk and also to increase flesh.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the milk is not materially influenced.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Millsboro, Del.\r\n\r\n     Pratts Cow Remedy was fed to the cow from the receipt of Remedy\r\n     until the calf was eight weeks old and the calf weighed 234 pounds\r\n     and was acknowledged unanimously to be the nicest calf that was\r\n     ever shipped from this depot.\r\n\r\n     W.R.

Alfalfa, where it can be freely grown, is king among soiling\r\nfoods. Peas and oats grown together are excellent, the bulk being peas.\r\nCorn is more commonly used, and in some sections sweet sorghum is given\r\nan important place. The aim should be to grow soiling foods that will be\r\nready for feeding in that succession that will provide food through all\r\nthe summer and autumn. Soiling furnished by grains, grasses, and clovers\r\nare usually fed in the stables or feed yards, and corn and sorghum are\r\nusually strewn over the pastures, as much as is needed from day to day.\r\n\r\nWhere much soiling food is wanted from year to year, it would seem safe\r\nto say that it can be most cheaply supplied in the form of silage. Even\r\nwhen grass is abundant, cows will eat with avidity more or less of\r\nensilage well made. They should not be fed in winter more than 25 pounds\r\nper animal per day, but the quantity needed is determined largely by the\r\ncondition of the pastures. Because of the less quantity of the silage\r\ncalled for in summer, the silo that contains the silage should be of\r\nless diameter than the silo that holds food for winter use, otherwise\r\nthe exposed silage will dry out too much between the times of feeding\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn autumn soiling foods may be fed with profit that are possessed of\r\nless succulence than would suffice at an earlier period, as in the\r\nautumn the pastures are usually more succulent than in the summer. Corn\r\nmay be fed at such a time with much advantage from the shock, and\r\nsorghum that has been harvested may likewise be fed from the shock or\r\nfrom the cocks. Pumpkins may be thrown into the pasture and broken when\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nViewed from the standpoint of milk production, the legumes (clover, cow\r\npeas, soy beans, etc.) must be assigned first rank. After these come\r\ngrain fodders, corn and sorghum fodders, and fodders from grasses,\r\nsuitable in the order named. Lowest of all is straw furnished by the\r\nsmall cereals. Fodders when fed are not restricted in quantity as\r\nconcentrates are.\r\n\r\nAmong legumes, hay furnished by alfalfa, any of the clovers, cow peas,\r\nsoy beans and vetches, is excellent for producing milk when these are\r\ncut at the proper stage and properly cured. Alfalfa should be cut for\r\nsuch feeding when only a small per cent. of blooms have been formed,\r\nclovers when in full bloom, and cow peas, soy beans, and vetches when\r\nthe first forward pods are filling. Proper curing means by the aid of\r\nwind stirring through the mass rather than sun bleaching it.\r\n\r\nWhen good leguminous fodders are fed, from 33 to 50 per cent. less grain\r\nwill suffice than would be called for when non-leguminous fodders only\r\nare fed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Leavenworth, Kansas.\r\n\r\n     When two veterinarians had given up a cow to die, I gave her Pratts\r\n     Animal Regulator with the result that she was on her feed in about\r\n     a week.

Such food is excellent for milk\r\nproduction when fed with suitable adjuncts, even though the fodder is\r\ngrown so thickly that nubbins do not form. The aim should be to feed the\r\nsorghums in the autumn and early winter and the corn so that it may be\r\nsupplemented by other hay when the winter is past, as later than the\r\ntime specified these foods deteriorate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~JERSEY COW~]\r\n\r\nRye and wheat straw are of little use in making milk, oat straw is\r\nbetter, and good bright pea straw is still more valuable.

JONES._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe necessity for feeding succulent food in some form where maximum milk\r\nyields are to be attained has come to be recognized by all dairy-men.\r\nThe plants that furnish succulence in winter are corn in all its\r\nvarieties, field roots of certain kinds, and the sorghums. Corn and\r\nsorghum to furnish the necessary succulence must be ensiled. Corn\r\nensilage is without a rival in providing winter succulence for cows.\r\nField roots furnish succulence that, pound for pound, is more valuable\r\nthan corn, because of the more favorable influence which it exerts on\r\nthe digestion. But roots cost more to grow than corn. Rutabagas and\r\nturnips will give the milk an offensive taint if fed freely at any other\r\ntime than just after the milk has been withdrawn, but that is not true\r\nof mangel wurtzel, sugar beets, or carrots.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for giving grain feed containing high percentage of\r\ndigestible matter (known as concentrates) to dairy cows is based on the\r\ninability of the cow to consume and digest enough coarse fodders to\r\nresult in maximum production, even though the fodders should be in\r\nbalance as to their constituents.\r\n\r\nConcentrates are purchased or home grown. It matters not from which\r\nsource they are obtained, but the values of those purchased are becoming\r\nso high as to force upon dairy-men the necessity of growing them at home\r\nas far as this may be practicable, and of insuring sound digestion by\r\ngiving some such tonic and appetizer as Pratts Cow Remedy. This splendid\r\nprescription should be kept on hand the year round, and should be given\r\nwith every feeding, especially in winter. Its value in keeping up milk\r\nproduction and for maintaining health is unequalled.\r\n\r\nThe method of furnishing concentrates by growing certain of the small\r\ngrains in combination is growing in favor. These combinations may\r\ninclude wheat, barley, outs, peas, and flax. Frequently but two\r\nvarieties are grown together. They are grown thus, in the first place,\r\nto secure better yields, and, in the second, to furnish concentrates in\r\napproximate balance. Such a food, for instance, is obtained from\r\ngrowing wheat and oats together, and if some flax is grown in the\r\nmixture it will be further improved.\r\n\r\nWhen choosing concentrates for feeding cows, the aim should be to select\r\nthem so that when fed along with the roughage on hand, they will be in\r\napproximate balance, that is, the elements in them will best meet the\r\nneeds of the cows.\r\n\r\nIf a flesh and milk-making food, like clover, is the source of the\r\nfodder, then a fat and heat-producing food, like corn, should furnish a\r\nlarge proportion of the grain fed. But it is not more profitable in all\r\ninstances to feed foods in exact balance. Some of the factors may be so\r\nhigh priced and others so cheap that it will pay better to feed them\r\nmore or less out of balance.\r\n\r\nWhen good clover hay or alfalfa is being fed to cows in milk, any one of\r\nthe following grain supplements will give satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n(1) Corn meal and wheat bran, equal parts by weight.\r\n\r\n(2) Corn meal, wheat bran, and ground oats in the proportions of 2, 1,\r\nand 1 parts.\r\n\r\n(3) Corn meal, wheat bran, and cottonseed meal in the proportion of 2,\r\n1, and 1 parts. Whether corn meal or corn and cob meals is fed is not\r\nvery material. Barley meal may be fed instead of corn.\r\n\r\nShould corn ensilage be fed to the extent of, say, 40 pounds per day\r\nalong with clover or alfalfa, any one of the following grain supplements\r\nshould suffice:\r\n\r\n(1) Corn or barley meal, wheat bran, and ground oats, fed in equal parts\r\nby weight.\r\n\r\n(2) Corn or barley meal and wheat bran, fed in the proportions of 1 and\r\n2 parts.\r\n\r\n(3) Corn or barley meal, cottonseed meal, and wheat or rice bran, fed in\r\nequal proportions.\r\n\r\n(4) Ground peas and oats, also fed in equal proportions. The succotash\r\nmixture may be fed alone or in conjunction with other meal added to make\r\nthe food still more in balance.\r\n\r\nIt is preferable to feed meal admixed with cut fodders. The mastication\r\nthat follows will then be more thorough and the digestion more complete.\r\nWhen ensilage is fed, admixture will result sufficiently if the meal is\r\nthrown over the ensilage where it has been put into the mangers.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure the animal obtaining full benefit of all its feed, it\r\nwill be found highly profitable to include Pratts Cow Remedy with the\r\ndaily ration. It acts as a digestive and at the same time insures a\r\nhealthy and natural action of the bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nBulls should be fed and managed with a view to secure good, large and\r\nrobust physical development and the retention of begetting powers\r\nunimpaired to a good old age. The aim should be to avoid tying bulls in\r\nthe stall continuously for any prolonged period, but to give them\r\nopportunity to take exercise in box stalls, paddocks, and pastures to\r\nthe greatest extent that may be practicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Jacksonville, Fla.\r\n\r\n     Have used Pratts Cow Remedy with good success as a general tonic\r\n     and for increasing milk.

A hole is then made with a suitable implement through\r\nthe cartilage between the nasal passages, and forward rather than\r\nbackward in the cartilage. The ring is then inserted, the two parts are\r\nbrought together again, and they are held in place by a small screw.\r\nWhen ringed, a strap or rope with a spring attached will suffice for a\r\ntime when leading them, but later they should be led with a lead, which\r\nis a strong, tough circular piece of wood, four to five feet long, with\r\na snap attached to one end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRATTS PRACTICAL POINTERS]\r\n\r\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|             ~SELL THE MILK BUT GROW THE CALVES~                      |\r\n|                                                                      |\r\n|Whole milk is too valuable to use as calf feed, even if calves--both  |\r\n|veals and those kept for dairy purposes--are selling at such high     |\r\n|prices.

During the one-year form\r\nthey should not be allowed to serve more than a score of cows; after\r\nthey have reached the age of 24 to 30 months they may be used with much\r\nfreedom in service until the vital forces begin to weaken with age. When\r\nproperly managed, waning should not begin before the age of 7 or 8\r\nyears. It has been found that the bull's service can be made more sure\r\nby the use of Pratts Cow Remedy, because of its mild and safe tonic\r\nproperties. Bulls should he able to serve from 75 to 300 cows a year\r\nwithout injury when the times of service spread over much of the year.\r\n\r\nCalves reared to be made into meat at a later period are very frequently\r\nallowed to nurse from their dams. This should never be done in the\r\ndairy. Such a method of raising them is adverse to maximum milk giving,\r\nas the calves when young cannot take all the milk the cows are capable\r\nof giving; hence the stimulus is absent that would lead her to give\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAt no time in the life of a dairy cow should she be allowed to suckle\r\nher calf longer than the third day of its existence.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the country, especially where whole milk is sold for\r\nconsumption in the cities, dairy-men frequently kill calves at birth\r\nbecause of lack of milk for feeding them. This practice is wrong and\r\nunnecessary. All strong calves should be grown, either for milking\r\nanimals or veal. And this can now be done, easily and cheaply, by\r\nfeeding Pratts Calf Meal, the perfect milk substitute, the guaranteed\r\n\"baby food for baby calves.\" When this scientific food is used, calves\r\nof really superior quality, big, sturdy, vigorous, are grown practically\r\nwithout milk.\r\n\r\nPratts Calf Meal must not be confused with coarse mixtures of mill\r\nby-products sometimes sold as \"calf meal\" or \"calf food.\" Pratts is as\r\ncarefully made as the baby foods which are so widely used for children.\r\nIt appeals to the calf's appetite, is easily and quickly digested,\r\nproduces rapid growth and even development. It does not cause scours and\r\nother digestive troubles. And it is easy to prepare and feed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~SHORT HORN COW~]\r\n\r\nIn chemical composition, Pratts Calf Meal is practically identical with\r\nthe solids of whole milk. It is made exclusively of materials especially\r\nsuited to calf feeding and these are always of the highest quality\r\nobtainable. This is one secret of the great success of this truly\r\nremarkable feed.\r\n\r\nThe various materials are ground very fine, milled separately, and are\r\nthen bolted to remove any coarse particles. They are then combined in\r\nexact proportions and thoroughly mixed.\r\n\r\nFinally, the mixture is steam-cooked, which makes the feed easy to\r\ndigest and assimilate. This expensive, but most necessary process,\r\nprevents indigestion and bowel troubles which accompany the use of\r\nunbolted, uncooked meals.\r\n\r\nWhere milk is available for calf feeding the following plan may be used:\r\n\r\nThe young calf should take milk from its dam for, say, three days.\r\nDuring that period the milk is only fit for feeding purposes. It is very\r\nimportant that the calf shall be started right, and in no way can this\r\nbe done so well as by Nature's method, that is, by allowing it to take\r\nmilk from the dam at will. At the end of that time it should be taught\r\nto drink. This can usually be accomplished without difficulty by\r\nallowing the calf to become hungry before its first lesson in drinking.\r\nIt should be given all whole milk, for say, two weeks. This given in\r\nthree feeds per day, and not more in quantity, as a rule, than two\r\nquarts at a feed.\r\n\r\nThe change from whole to skim-milk should be made gradually. A small\r\namount of skim-milk should be added to the whole milk the first day, and\r\na corresponding amount of whole milk withheld. The amount of skim-milk\r\nincreased from day to day, and the whole milk fed decreased\r\ncorrespondingly. The time covered in making the change from all whole to\r\nall skim-milk should be from one to two weeks. Any skim-milk that is\r\nsweet will answer, but it should not be fed to young calves at a lower\r\ntemperature than about 98 degrees in winter. Milk obtained by cream\r\nseparators, soon after drawn from the cow, is particularly suitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~HOLSTEIN COW~]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the change from whole to skim-milk is begun, some substitute\r\nshould be added to replace the fat withheld by reducing the amount of\r\nwhole milk fed. Ground flax or oil-meal is the best. It is generally fed\r\nin the latter form. In some instances the oil-meal is put directly into\r\nthe milk beginning with a heaping teaspoonful and gradually increasing\r\nthe quantity. A too lax condition of the digestion would indicate that\r\nan excessive amount was being fed. Later the meal may be more\r\nconveniently fed when mixed with other meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Riverdale, Md.\r\n\r\n     Very much pleased with results of Pratts Animal Regulator during\r\n     the present period of my cows breeding. An extraordinary strong\r\n     calf and the mother in fine condition.\r\n\r\n     WM. C. GRAY._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the calves will eat meal it should be given to them. No meal\r\nis more suitable at the first than ground oats and wheat bran. A little\r\nlater whole oats will answer quite well. To calves grown for dairy uses\r\nthey may form the sole grain food. If the calves are to be grown for\r\nbeef, some more fattening food, as ground corn, or ground barley, should\r\nbe added to the meal. For such calves, equal parts of bran, oats whole\r\nor ground, and ground corn, barley, rye, or speltz are excellent. Until\r\nthree months old they may be allowed to take all the grain that they\r\nwill eat. Later it may be necessary to restrict the quantity fed. Calves\r\nfor the dairy must be kept in a good growing condition, but without an\r\nexcess of fat. The meal should be kept in a box at all times accessible\r\nto the calves and should be frequently renewed. Grain feeding may cease\r\nwhen the calves are put upon pasture.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the calves will eat fodder it should be given to them. Fodder\r\ngives the necessary distention to the digestive organs, which makes the\r\nanimals capable of taking a sufficient quantity of food to result in\r\nhigh production. Alfalfa, clover-hay, and pea and oat hay are excellent,\r\nprovided they are of fine growth and cut before they are too advanced in\r\ngrowth. If field roots can be added to the fodder the result in\r\ndevelopment and good digestion will be excellent. Any kind of field\r\nroots are good, but mangels, sugar beets, and rutabagas are the most\r\nsuitable because of their good keeping qualities. They should be fed\r\nsliced, preferably with a root slicer, and the calves may be given all\r\nthat they will eat without harm resulting.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the milk period more commonly covers three to four\r\nmonths with calves that are hand fed, but it may be extended\r\nindefinitely providing skim-milk may be spared for such a use. Such\r\nfeeding is costly. Calves reared on their dams are seldom allowed milk\r\nfor more than six or seven months, save when they are reared for show\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n(1) The amount should be determined by the observed capacity of the calf\r\nto take milk and by the relative cost of the skim-milk and the adjuncts\r\nfed along with it.\r\n\r\n(2) During the first weeks until it begins to eat other food freely, it\r\nshould be given all the milk that it will take without disturbing the\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\n(3) Usually it would be safe to begin with six pounds of milk per day,\r\ngiving eight pounds at the end of the first week, and to add one pound\r\neach week subsequently until the age of 10 to 12 weeks. Any excess of\r\nmilk given at one time usually disturbs the digestion and is followed by\r\ntoo lax a condition of the bowels.\r\n\r\nWhen milk has been the chief food, and the weaning is sudden, usually\r\ngrowth will be more or less arrested. When sustained largely on other\r\nfoods, the change may be made without any check to the growth, even in\r\nthe case of calves that suck their dams. When hand raised, the quantity\r\nof milk is gradually reduced until none is given. In the case of sucking\r\ncalves they should be allowed to take milk once a day for a time before\r\nbeing shut entirely away from the dams. The supplementary food should be\r\nstrengthened as the milk is withheld.\r\n\r\nCalves should have constant access to good water, even during the milk\r\nperiod, and also to salt.\r\n\r\nWhere many are fed simultaneously, the milk should be given in pails\r\nkept scrupulously clean. The pails should be set in a manger, but not\r\nuntil the calves have been secured by the neck in suitable stanchions.\r\nAs soon as they have taken the milk, a little meal should be thrown into\r\neach pail. Eating the dry meal takes away the desire to suck one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nCalves of the dairy, dual purpose, and beef breeds may be reared by hand\r\nalong the same lines, but with the following points of difference:\r\n\r\n(1) The dual types want to carry more flesh than the dairy types, and\r\nthe beef types more than either.\r\n\r\n(2) To secure this end, more and richer milk must be given to calves of\r\nthe beef type, especially during the first weeks of growth. Forcing\r\ncalves of the beef type would be against the highest development\r\nattainable. Until the milking period is reached, the food and general\r\ntreatment for the three classes is the same. They should be in fair\r\nflesh until they begin to furnish milk.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Coshocton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n     With good care and Pratts Animal Regulator (which I have used for\r\n     two years) this Jersey calf grew like a weed.

ELLEN BUTZ._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen calves come in the autumn, the heifers enter the first winter\r\nstrong and vigorous. They should be so fed that growth will be\r\ncontinuous right through the winter, but on cheap foods. It is different\r\nwith animals for the block, which should have grain every winter until\r\nsold, when reared on the arable farm, unless roots are freely fed, when\r\nthey may be carried through the winter in fine form on straw and\r\ncornstalks, feeding some hay toward spring. They may be fed in an open\r\nor a closed shed, and without being tied when dehorned as they ought to\r\nbe when not purely bred. It is a good time to dehorn them when about one\r\nyear old, as they will be more peaceful subsequently than if the horns\r\nhad never been allowed to grow. The bedding should be plentiful and they\r\nshould have free access to water and salt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~HEREFORD BULL~]\r\n\r\nTo carry growing animals through the winter so that they make no\r\nincrease and in some instances lose weight, to be made up the following\r\nsummer, is short-sighted policy and wasteful of food. If a stunted\r\ncondition is allowed at any time, increase is not only retarded, but the\r\ncapacity for future increase is also lessened.\r\n\r\nThe pastures for heifers should be abundant, or supplemented by soiling\r\nfood where they are short. This is specially necessary because the\r\nheifers will then be pregnant, and because of the burden thus put upon\r\nthem in addition to that of growth, certain evils will follow.\r\n\r\nIn some instances calves are grown on whole milk and adjuncts, and are\r\nsold at the age of 6 to 9 months. This is practicable when two or three\r\ncalves are reared on one cow. The meal adjuncts to accompany such\r\nfeeding may consist of ground corn, oats, bran, and oil meal, fed in the\r\nproportions of, say 4, 2, 1, and 1 parts by weight. In some instances\r\nthey are kept two or three months longer, and when sold such calves well\r\nfattened bring high prices.\r\n\r\nThe growing of baby beef is coming into much favor. Baby beef means beef\r\nput upon the market when it can no longer be called veal and when\r\nconsiderably short of maturity, usually under the age of 24 months. To\r\ngrow such beef properly animals must be given a good healthy start,\r\ngrowth must not be interrupted and must be reasonably rapid, and the\r\ncondition of flesh in which they are kept must be higher than for\r\nbreeding uses. The process is in a sense a forcing one through feeding\r\nof relatively large amounts of grain. Though kept in good flesh all the\r\nwhile, the highest condition of flesh should be sought during the latter\r\nstages of feeding.\r\n\r\nWhen stall feeding begins, cattle are led up gradually during\r\npreliminary feeding to full feeding. Full feeding means consumption of\r\nall grain and other food the animal can take without injuring digestion.\r\nA lean animal cannot be fattened quickly. Before rapid deposits of fat\r\ncan occur the lean animal must be brought into a well-nourished\r\ncondition. Preliminary feeding should cover a period of four to eight\r\nweeks in ordinary fattening.\r\n\r\nWhen cattle are to be finished on grass, they are usually fed a moderate\r\namount of grain daily the previous winter. The amount will be influenced\r\nby the character of the fodders and by the season when the cattle are to\r\nbe sold. Usually it is not less than three pounds per animal, daily, nor\r\nmore than six pounds. Steers will fatten in much shorter time when\r\nPratts Cow Remedy is used. It causes them to quickly put on solid flesh,\r\ndue to its action on the blood, bowels, and digestive organs.\r\n\r\n~COMMON DISEASES OF CATTLE~\r\n\r\nThe cow is generally healthy and if fed, stabled and cared for properly\r\nshe will seldom be ill.\r\n\r\nWhen a cow is sick, provide clean, comfortable quarters, with plenty of\r\nbedding and let her lie down. If weather is cold, cover her with a\r\nblanket. A healthy cow has a good appetite, the muzzle is moist, the eye\r\nbright, coat is smooth, the horns are warm, breathing is regular, the\r\nmilk is given in good quantities and the process of rumination is\r\nconstant soon after eating. The sick cow has more or less fever, the\r\nmuzzle is dry and hot, the breathing is rapid, no appetite, an increase\r\nin the pulse, dull eye, rough coat, a suspension of rumination, and the\r\ncow will stand alone with head down. Usually all that is needed is\r\nPratts Cow Remedy with bran mashes and good digestible feed. Give pure,\r\nclean water, and careful attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Preventing Milk Fever~\r\n\r\nMany excellent cows have been lost through milk fever within a day or\r\ntwo of the birth of the calf. The preventive measures include:\r\n\r\n(1) Reducing the quantity of the food fed.\r\n\r\n(2) Feeding food that is not unduly succulent, lest the milk flow should\r\nbe overstimulated.\r\n\r\n(3) Giving a mild purgative a day or two before the calf is born, or\r\nwithin a few hours after its birth. The purgative most commonly used is\r\nEpsom salts, and the dose is three-quarters of a pound to one pound.\r\n\r\n(4) Removing only a small portion of the milk at a time for the first\r\ntwo or three days. Only moderate amounts of food are necessary until the\r\ndanger of milk fever is past. Where Pratts Cow Remedy has been given,\r\nthere is little, if any, danger of milk fever. The value of this\r\nsplendid prescription during the calving season has been tested time and\r\ntime again.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Abortion~\r\n\r\nA germ disease highly contagious and one of the most injurious of those\r\nwhich affect dairy cattle. The money-making value of a herd in which the\r\ngerms of contagious abortion are permitted to exist will be completely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nA cow which has once aborted will do so again unless carefully treated.\r\nSo contagious is the disease that the germs introduced into a perfectly\r\nhealthy cow will cause her to abort, and it is no uncommon thing for the\r\ninfection to spread through an entire herd in a single season. The herd\r\nbull readily becomes a source of herd infection, and service from a\r\nbull, where there are aborting cows should be refused.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--By infection, the herding together of a large number of cows,\r\nhigh feeding, smutty corn and ergotty pastures. In a small number of\r\ncows abortion may result from accidental injuries. Such cases are pure\r\naccidents and are not to be considered along with contagious abortion.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Bradford, Ohio.\r\n\r\n     Abortion had got a hold on my herd and I was expecting to have to\r\n     dispose of them, when Pratts Cow Remedy came to my rescue.

LOXLEY, JR._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As in all contagious diseases, treatment should be given\r\nthe infected animals and sanitary measures with treatment should be\r\nadopted to prevent its spread to healthy cows. For increasing the\r\ndisease resistance of cows as well as for building up the vitality of\r\ninfected and suspected animals, Pratts Cow Remedy is most effective. It\r\nis a true remedy and tonic, which restores to health and upbuilds the\r\ncow's constitution. It is all medicine, free from harmful ingredients or\r\nmineral poisons.\r\n\r\nGive one level tablespoonful of Pratts Cow Remedy three times a day to\r\neach cow, either with the grain or separately.\r\n\r\nPratts Cow Remedy should be given before and after service, and when\r\nContagious Abortion is only suspected, should be continued during the\r\nperiod when the cow is in calf.\r\n\r\nAn excellent preventive practice is to douche the vagina of all pregnant\r\ncows and to wash the tails and hind quarters of the entire herd with one\r\npart Pratts Dip and Disinfectant to 100 parts warm water.\r\n\r\nAs a certain number of the cows will harbor the germ in the womb when\r\ntreatment is started, it is not to be expected that abortion will cease\r\nat once, but by keeping up the treatment the trouble will probably\r\ndisappear the following year.\r\n\r\nWhen the small cost of Pratts Cow Remedy and Pratts Dip and Disinfectant\r\nand their wonderful effectiveness in ridding the cow of the disease are\r\nconsidered, there is no question but that it ought always to be given to\r\nall cows to keep them well.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the spread of Contagious Abortion, the entire premises should\r\nbe disinfected regularly with Pratts Dip and Disinfectant.\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                ~COMFORT FOR COW AND MILKER~                            |\r\n|                                                                        |\r\n|Milking is a twice-a-day job.

It is most likely to occur after abortion.\r\nAgain, in low conditions of health and an imperfect power of\r\ncontraction, we have causes for retention. The condition is common when\r\nthe cow is given food insufficient in quantity or in nutriment.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Blanket the cow in a warm stable, and three times a day\r\ngive hot drinks and hot mashes of wheat bran to which two\r\ntablespoonfuls of Pratts Cow Remedy have been added. When the\r\nafter-birth comes away, continue treatment giving one tablespoonful of\r\nPratts Cow Remedy until full recovery. The vagina and womb should be\r\nsyringed with a solution of one ounce of Pratts Dip and Disinfectant to\r\na gallon of warm water. Repeat daily until all discharge has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--If the cow has been given Pratts Cow Remedy during\r\npregnancy or from two to four weeks before calving, there will be very\r\nfew cases of this trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Barrenness and Sterility~\r\n\r\nWhen a cow persistently fails to breed and bear young, she is said to be\r\nbarren. That a barren cow cannot be a profit maker, goes without saying.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Barrenness in many cases is due to malformation of the\r\ngenerative organs, tumors or other diseased conditions. Very frequently\r\nit is a result of Contagious Abortion, and this should always be\r\nsuspected. Cows bred at too early an age frequently produce calves which\r\nprove to be barren, due to constitutional weakness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The true preventive of such conditions is to be found in\r\nsound hygiene. Use Pratts Dip and Disinfectant freely about the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nThe breeding animal should be of adult age neither overfed nor underfed,\r\nbut well fed and moderately exercised.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the beneficial results of exercise, it is of record that a\r\ncow pronounced barren, when driven to a new owner, living several miles\r\ndistant, became fertile and for years thereafter produced healthy\r\ncalves.\r\n\r\nVigorous health must be sought, not only that a strong race may be\r\npropagated but that the cow may breed with certainty.\r\n\r\nFor toning up the generative organs, so that they can perform their\r\nnatural functions, Pratts Cow Remedy is safe and positive.\r\n\r\nThe usual dose is a level tablespoonful twice a day in the feed.\r\n\r\nThus for less than a cent a day, you can make sure of the cow enjoying\r\nhealth and being productive.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Aphtha, Sores on the Lips and Tongue~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Painful blisters which become sores on the lips and tongue.\r\nOccurs often in sucking calves.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash the mouth twice a day with one ounce of borax and one\r\nfluid ounce of myrrh mixed in one quart of water or a mild solution of\r\nPratts Dip and Disinfectant. Give Pratts Cow Remedy daily. If the mouth\r\nis very sore give the remedies in gruel form. Feed animal on regular\r\ngruel feed. If it occurs in calves, give Pratts Cow Remedy with milk and\r\nuse borax as mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Pittsfield, Ill.\r\n\r\n     Am using Pratts Bag Ointment on young heifer with a very sore bag\r\n     and she is doing fine.

Then came a\r\nperiod of depression in this line accompanied by a steady decrease in\r\nthe number of sheep kept. But the tide turned again about 1914 and the\r\nsheep are rapidly coming back to American farms and ranges.\r\n\r\nThis change is doubtless due to the steadily increasing cost of grain\r\nand labor accompanied by correspondingly high prices of lamb, mutton and\r\nwool. Also to a general recognition of the economic value of sheep--both\r\nof the mutton and wool breeds--as quick producers of income, no little\r\npart of which should be profit. The latter point is due to the fact that\r\nsheep are inexpensive to maintain as they thrive upon the roughest of\r\npastures and coarse feeds which will not sell to advantage, and their\r\ncare consumes but little time. Low production costs--feed and labor--and\r\nhigh prices for the products make a most satisfactory combination.\r\n\r\nMethods of successful sheep management vary in different sections of the\r\ncountry. The beginner may well consult the successful sheep-growers in\r\nhis section and adopt the methods which give good results under the\r\nconditions existing in his locality. At the same time he should neglect\r\nno opportunity to secure more information from all sources, in order to\r\nknow and use the most advanced methods and so make the maximum profits.\r\n\r\nHere are a few basic facts:\r\n\r\nSheep raising requires careful attention, but does not demand a great\r\namount of heavy labor or expensive equipment.\r\n\r\nThe best time to make a start is in the early fall when good breeding\r\nstock may be selected.\r\n\r\nWhile pure-bred breeders are best, a pure-bred ram and ewes of good\r\ngrade will prove very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nA start may be made in a small way, but it is best to have at least\r\ntwenty to forty breeders for economy of time, labor and other expenses.\r\n\r\nAs a rule it is most profitable to push the lambs for growth and market\r\nthem when they weigh 65 to 75 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis weight can be secured in about four months.\r\n\r\nIf a very large pasture is available the flock will thrive on this.\r\nOtherwise fields must be fenced off and forage crops provided.\r\n\r\nBreeding ewes must be exercised in the winter to insure strong lambs.\r\nBut protect them from rain or wet snow as soaked fleeces cause colds and\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~SHROPSHIRE SHEEP~]\r\n\r\nThrifty condition and vigorous health must be maintained at all costs.\r\nOtherwise the lambs will be small and weak and fleeces of inferior\r\nquality. The regular use of Pratts Animal Regulator will improve\r\ncondition, insure health and vigor, increase number and quality of\r\nlambs, promote growth of flesh and wool. And in large measure, it keeps\r\ncommon diseases away because Pratt-fed sheep are in condition to\r\n_resist_ disease.\r\n\r\nShearing should be done after lambing, usually in late spring or early\r\nsummer. If lambing time is late, the shearing may be done before the\r\nlambs arrive. Tie up the fleeces separately, first sorting out dung\r\nlocks and tags.\r\n\r\nAfter lambing, the individual ewes should be carefully watched to see\r\nthat they have plenty of milk and are in good condition. They should be\r\nkept in pens for about three days, when they may be permitted to run\r\nwith the flock. Feed lightly for two or three days, then heavily to\r\nstimulate the milk flow so lambs will be well-nourished. They may\r\nprofitably receive one to two pounds of grain per day during the nursing\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nInferior ewes should be marketed as rapidly as they are identified. Get\r\nrid of the barren ones, producers of poor lambs, poor milkers, light\r\nshearers.\r\n\r\nSheep must be protected against blood-thirsty dogs and external and\r\ninternal parasites. In many sections sheep growers have united to fight\r\nsheep-killing dogs and good results have been secured. United action\r\nagainst a common enemy is best, as public sentiment may thus be aroused.\r\n\r\nBecause of their thick fleeces and helplessness, sheep suffer greatly\r\nfrom the attacks of ticks, lice and other parasites. Ticks are\r\nparticularly injurious. They annoy and weaken the adult animals, torture\r\nthe lambs and check their growth. The result is always a money loss to\r\nthe sheep owner.\r\n\r\nFortunately it is a simple matter to exterminate the ticks and lice and\r\novercome the ordinary skin diseases of sheep. Merely dip the sheep in a\r\nsolution of Pratts Disinfectant. It is non-poisonous, inexpensive--does\r\nthe work!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~MERINO RAM~]\r\n\r\nJuly and August is the popular time for dipping, but the work can be\r\ndone as soon after shearing as the shear cuts heal. Two dippings are\r\nnecessary, about twenty-four days apart. The first treatment may not\r\nkill all the eggs, but the second will kill the young ticks, thus\r\ncompleting the job. For successful results, it is necessary to use a\r\ndipping tank or vat large enough to hold sufficient of the solution to\r\nimmerse and thoroughly saturate each animal.\r\n\r\nIntestinal parasites, of which the stomach worm is perhaps the most\r\ndreaded, cause great loss to sheep owners. These worms live in the\r\nfourth stomach. They are easily identified, being from one-half to one\r\nand a quarter inches long, marked with a red stripe. Their eggs are\r\nfound in the droppings of the sheep, so infection is secured in the\r\npasture.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Augusta, Me.\r\n\r\n     As a constant user of Pratts Animal Regulator, for sheep, I find\r\n     that it not only helps them to put on flesh but keeps their system\r\n     in fine condition.

Swine are specially valuable for\r\nutilizing food that would otherwise go to waste. They are an invaluable\r\nadjunct to the dairy, particularly when the whole milk is separated on\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nYou can grow big, healthy, profit-paying hogs, if you will merely meet\r\ncertain clearly defined hog requirements. If you do this, and it's easy,\r\nyou need never worry about profits. You are _sure_ to succeed.\r\n\r\nThe world needs and will pay you well for all the hogs you can produce.\r\nAside from the pork products required for consumption in America, the\r\nhog growers of the United States must for years export to Europe more\r\npork in various forms, and more lard, than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe European herds of hogs have been sadly depleted. Dr. Vernon Kellogg,\r\nof the United States Food Administration, has personally investigated\r\nthe situation. He reports decreases in hogs in leading countries as\r\nfollows: France, 49 per cent.; Great Britain, 25 per cent.; Italy,\r\n12 1/2 per cent. And, of course, conditions are even worse in Germany,\r\nAustria and the Balkan Nations, all of which are big producers in normal\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nProperly handled, kept healthy and vigorous, the American hog is a\r\nmoney-maker. Many farmers know this from experience: others fail to\r\nrealize how useful and profitable the hog really is.\r\n\r\nThe experts connected with the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nmake the following assertions in Farmers' Bulletin 874:\r\n\r\n\"No branch of live-stock farming gives better results than the raising\r\nof well-bred swine when conducted with a reasonable amount of\r\nintelligence. The hog is one of the most important animals to raise on\r\nthe farm, either for meat or for profit, and no farm is complete unless\r\nsome hogs are kept to aid in the modern method of farming. The farmers\r\nof the South and West, awakening to the merits of the hog, are rapidly\r\nincreasing their output of pork and their bank accounts. The hog\r\nrequires less labor, less equipment, less capital, and makes greater\r\ngains per hundred pounds of concentrates than any other farm animal, and\r\nreproduces himself faster and in greater numbers; and returns the money\r\ninvested more quickly than any other farm animal except poultry.\"\r\n\r\nThe University of Minnesota, in Extension Bulletin 7, sums up the matter\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"From a business point of view, the hog is described as a great national\r\nresource, a farm mortgage lifter and debt-payer, and the most generally\r\nprofitable domesticated animal in American agriculture.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this summarizes the general opinion of progressive hog growers and\r\nthe experts connected with the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nand the various State Agricultural Experiment Stations and Colleges.\r\n\r\nBreeds of hogs are divided into two general classes--bacon type and lard\r\ntype. Where milk is plentiful, and especially where such foods as barley\r\nand peas are grown, the bacon type will be the most profitable, as they\r\nfurnish the largest litters and also make pork that brings the best\r\nprice in the market. The lard type of swine are usually kept where corn\r\nis the cereal that is most grown.\r\n\r\nThe large Yorkshire and Tamworth are the leading bacon breeds. The\r\nPoland China, the Duroc Jersey, and the Chester White are leading lard\r\ntypes. The Berkshires, Cheshires, and Hampshires are intermediate\r\nbetween the bacon and lard types. When bacon sires are crossed upon sows\r\nof any of the other breeds, the progeny are excellent for pork.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who is about to adopt a breed should be sure to select one of\r\nthe standard and common breeds of his own neighborhood. Many men make\r\nthe mistake of introducing a breed new to the section, and when the time\r\ncomes that a new boar must be secured much difficulty and expense are\r\nincurred before a satisfactory one can be found.\r\n\r\nThe bulletin quoted above further says: \"To the production of pork,\r\nthen, in _the largest amount_, in _the shortest time_, and with _the\r\nminimum of money and labor_, all the details of the hog-raising industry\r\nare directed.\" Here is the whole secret--pork in largest amount, in\r\nshortest time, at lowest production costs. And the very foundation is\r\nperfect health and vigorous condition of the hogs, both breeding animals\r\nand market stock.\r\n\r\nHealth and vigor are necessary in the breeding animals if they are to\r\nproduce big litters of sturdy pigs--in the market animals if they are to\r\nconsume large amounts of food and economically and quickly convert it\r\ninto fat and muscle. Weak, sickly, run-down hogs are a constant source\r\nof trouble and are never profitable under any conditions. Disease is one\r\nof the greatest drawbacks in the hog industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~POLAND CHINA PIG~]\r\n\r\nWhen selecting brood sows of any breed, the preference should be given\r\nto those which have reasonably long sides and limbs of medium length.\r\nWhen selecting boars make sure that vigor is present in a marked degree\r\nand also strong limbs. Any weakness in the back of male or female is to\r\nbe carefully shunned.\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy two facts must be borne in mind. The first is that the\r\nsow is doing double duty. She is keeping up her own bodily functions, as\r\nwell as developing her fetal litter. Therefore, feeding should be\r\nliberal. The mistakes in feeding breeding animals are more frequently\r\nthose which keep such stock thin. The importance of ample feeding at\r\nthis time is a demonstrated fact, as well as one which appeals to common\r\nsense.\r\n\r\nIn the second place the sow is building new tissue. Hence the kind of\r\nfeed is important. Bran, peas, oats and barley and such forage plants as\r\nclover, alfalfa, vetches and the like. Ordinary pasture grasses are of\r\nmuch value.\r\n\r\nAll breeders lay great emphasis on the condition of the bowels during\r\npregnancy, and particularly at farrowing. The special danger to be\r\navoided is constipation. It is right here that Pratts Hog Tonic shows\r\nits great worth to hog raiser. It puts the digestion organs into healthy\r\ncondition and the result is safe farrowing and a healthy litter which\r\nis not apt to suffer from scours or thumps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~DUROC-JERSEY BOAR~]\r\n\r\nGood health is inherited from vigorous, healthy ancestors. It is\r\nintensified and preserved by proper management. \"The time to begin\r\nfitting pigs for market is before they are farrowed. For this reason it\r\nis advisable to pay particular attention to the feed and care of the\r\nbrood sow from breeding to farrowing time.\" And \"It must be understood\r\nthat it is much easier to continue an animal (hog) in a thrifty, hardy\r\ncondition than to bring the animal back to his normal appetite and rate\r\nof growth, once he is out of order.\" (Circular 90, New Jersey Agr. Exp.\r\nStation.)\r\n\r\nThese common-sense statements must appeal to the reason of every\r\nthinking hog producer. And they make plain the wisdom of regularly\r\nsupplying Pratts Hog Tonic to the entire herd, to breeding stock,\r\ngrowing pigs, fattening hogs.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable natural tonic and conditioners _is not_ a specific for\r\nany single disease. It is a health-builder and health-preserver. In this\r\nconnection we wish to particularly mention that most dreaded and\r\ndestructive of all hog diseases--hog cholera. We do not claim that\r\nPratts Hog Tonic will entirely prevent or cure this scourge. But it will\r\nput and keep your herd in such fine condition that the individuals will\r\nbe more resistant and will not as readily contract cholera or other germ\r\ndiseases. It will prevent and control such troubles as indigestion,\r\ndiarrhoea, constipation and the like, which are such a source of trouble\r\nin the average herd.\r\n\r\nYou may not appreciate the value of using such a conditioner, but the\r\nKentucky Agr. Exp. Station, in Bulletin 181, contains the following\r\nstatement which deserves the careful consideration of every thoughtful\r\nhog raiser: _\"General conditioners have been found to be advantageous in\r\nthe maintenance of healthy conditions in hogs_.\"\r\n\r\nBrood sows should not produce their first litter under twelve months.\r\nWhether they should produce one or two litters a year will depend\r\nlargely upon the conditions, especially of climate. Sows should be kept\r\nfor breeding as long as they will produce good, even litters.\r\nWell-chosen sows should rear an average of eight to the litter.\r\n\r\nBrood sows should have ample exercise. They get it in good form when\r\nthey are allowed to turn over litter in the barnyard on which a little\r\ngrain, as corn, has previously been sprinkled. Two-thirds of the winter\r\nrations may consist of mangels or alfalfa hay--the other third being\r\ngrain or swill. Alfalfa for hogs should be cut before blossoming.\r\n\r\nWhen sows farrow they should be fed lightly for the first three days.\r\nLater give all they will eat of milk-making foods. A combination of\r\nground oats, wheat shorts, and some corn is excellent. And Pratts Hog\r\nTonic will be found especially valuable during the nursing period. Meal\r\nis fed ground and soaked. As soon as young pigs will take skim-milk they\r\nshould get it in a trough apart from the sow. They are weaned at seven\r\nor eight weeks where two litters are grown in a year, and at twelve\r\nweeks where but one is grown.\r\n\r\nWhen pigs are weaned, and previously, there is nothing better than\r\nshorts and skim milk. They should be grown subsequently to weaning on\r\npasture, with one to two pounds of grain added daily. In season, winter\r\nor spring rye, clover, alfalfa, barley, and rape all make excellent\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nThe fattening period with swine covers from six to eight weeks. Unground\r\ncorn and water will fatten swine in good form. The same is true of\r\nbarley and rye, ground and soaked. They may be fattened nicely while\r\ngrazing on field peas. They may also be similarly fattened by hogging\r\noff corn or gathering it from the excrement of cattle that are being\r\nfattened on it. Swine well grown should make an average gain of a pound\r\na day. Bacon swine may be best sold at 175 to 200 pounds in weight. Lard\r\ntypes are usually grown to greater weights.\r\n\r\nSwine breeders have long recognized the value of Pratts Hog Tonic as a\r\ndisease preventive and fattener. Progressive breeders now consider it a\r\nnecessity in profitable hog raising.\r\n\r\nIf a second litter is wanted during a year the sows should be put to the\r\nboar during the first heat after weaning. Many breeders do not like to\r\npass periods of heat for fear that the sows may become \"shy,\" and there\r\nis little reason why a sow should not have two litters a year. In any\r\ncase, the sows should be carried on comparatively light feed until time\r\nto breed again, gaining a little in weight; and their treatment after\r\nbreeding should be as already detailed for pregnant sows.\r\n\r\nWhen the boar arrives at the farm he should be dipped in a solution of\r\nPratts Dip and Disinfectant, as a matter of ordinary precaution against\r\nthe introduction of vermin. As an additional precaution, a quarantine\r\npen should be ready for him, especially if epizootics are prevalent. His\r\nfeed before change of owners should be known, and either adhered to or\r\nchanged gradually to suit the new conditions. If he has come from a long\r\ndistance it will be well to feed lightly until he is well acclimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~TAMWORTH PIG~]\r\n\r\nBreeders generally advocate the practice of keeping a boar to himself\r\nduring the entire year--out of sight and hearing of the sows. However, a\r\nboar is often allowed to run with the sows after they are safe in pig;\r\nbut during the breeding season it is by far the best policy to keep him\r\nby himself, admitting a sow to his yard for mating, and allowing but one\r\nservice. The litters will generally be larger and the pigs stronger.\r\n\r\nThe boar should not serve more than two sows daily, preferably one in\r\nthe morning and one in the afternoon, and can serve 50 to 60 in a season\r\nwithout difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the boar in vigorous physical condition, he should be\r\ngiven Pratts Hog Tonic regularly. The beneficial results will be seen in\r\nthe way of larger litters and stronger pigs.\r\n\r\nThe greatest drawback to the hog industry which breeders in this country\r\nhave to contend against is found in the losses which may be experienced\r\nthrough the infestation of the animals, especially young pigs, by\r\nparasites, through outbreaks of hog cholera or swine plague, or through\r\nthe contraction of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~CHESTER WHITE BOAR~]\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the diseases of hogs, preventive measures must be most\r\nrelied upon. The animals must be given dry and well-ventilated quarters,\r\nwhich must be kept clean. Contrary to common belief, hogs have some\r\nhabits which raise them above other domestic animals from the\r\nstandpoint of cleanliness. For example, unless compelled to do so, a\r\nhog will not sleep in its own filth. If part of the floor of the pen is\r\nraised and kept well bedded with straw, while the rest is not, all\r\nexcrement will be left on the unbedded portion of the floor, and the bed\r\nitself will be always clean.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cleanliness, close attention should be given to the feed\r\nwhich is supplied, that nothing may be fed which will convey the germs\r\nof disease, especially tuberculosis, to the herd. If the hogs are fed\r\nmilk in any form obtained from cows kept upon the same farm, the cows\r\nshould be subjected to the tuberculin test, as by this means all\r\ntuberculous milk may be kept from the hogs. If they run with the cattle\r\nof the farm a tuberculin test of all the cattle is none the less\r\ndesirable. Animals dead from any disease should not be fed to the hogs\r\nuntil the meat has been made safe by cooking. Skim milk or refuse from a\r\npublic creamery should not be fed to hogs until it has been thoroughly\r\nsterilized.\r\n\r\nFeeding and drinking places should be clean and the water supply pure.\r\nUnless the origin is known to be uncontaminated and there has been no\r\npossibility of infection during its course, hogs should not be allowed\r\naccess to any stream. Wallows should be drained out or kept filled up as\r\nmuch as possible. At least once a month the quarters should be\r\ndisinfected with a solution of Pratts Dip and Disinfectant. These\r\nprecautions will be found valuable aids in the destruction of the\r\nvarious animal parasites, as well as a protection from some more serious\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nThe methods of feeding and management outlined above have been\r\nsuccessfully followed by hog growers for many years. They are\r\nconservative and safe. But during recent years a new method of feeding\r\nhas been developed and is being generally adopted, especially by\r\nspecialists who make hog growing a real business. This is known as the\r\n\"self-fed\" plan, under which system feed is kept before the hogs at all\r\ntimes and they are permitted to eat at will. In poultry feeding this is\r\ncalled \"the dry mash system.\"\r\n\r\nJust who deserves credit for originating or developing this plan cannot\r\nbe stated. That it is a good one is evidenced by the fact that it has\r\nreceived the endorsement of the Bureau of Animal Industry, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture; of many Agricultural Experiment Stations; of\r\nthe specialty swine journals; of practical hog breeders in all sections\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nFor this self-feed plan it is claimed that both feed and labor are\r\nsaved, thus reducing production costs. That a 250-pound hog can be grown\r\nin thirty days less time than is possible where slop-feeding is\r\npracticed, thus getting the hogs to market earlier and avoiding danger\r\nof loss during this time. That it produces pork of highest quality, the\r\nmeat being fine in flavor, firm, and with lean and fat well distributed.\r\n\r\nAdvocates of the self-feeding plan make the following comparison with\r\nthe old-time slop-feeding method:\r\n\r\nWhen dry food is supplied in automatic feeders, the attendant may fill\r\nthe feeders at any convenient time of day and that at intervals of\r\nseveral days. In slop feeding, the meals must be prepared and fed twice\r\ndaily, usually when other duties are pressing and time especially\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nWhen dry, ground grains are kept before the hogs at all times, they eat\r\nwhen they feel the need of food and are not liable to overeat at any\r\ntime. Because of the dry character of the feed, they eat slowly,\r\nmasticating the food thoroughly and mixing it with saliva. This means\r\nmore thorough digestion and an absence of indigestion and bowel\r\ntroubles. And, of course, quicker growth.\r\n\r\nSlop-fed hogs, on the other hand, get very hungry between meals. At\r\nfeeding time they pile up around the troughs, the stronger rushing and\r\npushing away the weaker ones, those that really need the feed the most.\r\nThen they bolt the food without chewing it, taking all they can hold and\r\nleaving little for those that cannot find a place at the \"first table.\"\r\n\r\nThe quality of the dry-fed pork has been mentioned. Equally important,\r\nfrom the standpoint of the butcher, is the loss in dressing of hogs.\r\nTests have shown that slop-fed stock loses six to eight pounds more per\r\nhundredweight than does the dry-fed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~BERKSHIRE BOAR~]\r\n\r\nAnother big advantage of dry-feeding lies in the fact that large numbers\r\nof swine, including those of various ages and sizes, can be safely kept\r\nin one herd. The writer has seen over two hundred head of swine, ranging\r\nin size from pigs just weaned to 250-pound porkers ready for market,\r\nliving in peace and contentment in one building, eating and sleeping and\r\nsharing the forage pastures together. Of course this means a big saving\r\nin buildings and fencing and a great reduction in the amount of\r\nnecessary labor.\r\n\r\nThe self-feeder may be used all through the life of the hog, beginning\r\nwhen the pigs are still nursing and continuing until they reach market\r\nweight. During all this time the ration should contain Pratts Hog Tonic,\r\nthe guaranteed hog conditioner, in order that at all times the herd may\r\nbe maintained in vigorous condition, be kept free from disease, may\r\navoid wasting feed through imperfect or sluggish digestion, may earn for\r\nthe farmer the maximum amount of profit. We suggest that you make a test\r\nof this results-insuring, profit-producing tonic. Watch results. If\r\n_you_ are not satisfied the dealer from whom you purchased the goods\r\nwill refund the full amount you paid for them.\r\n\r\nThe self-feeding plan of growing hogs gives best results when the\r\nanimals are given access to growing forage crops. The feeders may be\r\nplaced under cover out in the fields or kept in the hog house if the\r\nlatter is reasonably near the pasture lots. An unlimited supply of fresh\r\nwater must be available at all times because dry-fed stock drinks many\r\ntimes the amount of water that slop-fed hogs do. The reason is plain.\r\n\r\nThere are many different systems of handling hogs under this plan,\r\nvarying according to local conditions. We will give in detail the method\r\nused most successfully for many years on a Pennsylvania farm which each\r\nseason markets several hundred hogs of a quality which commands a\r\npremium above current quotations.\r\n\r\nOn this farm, particular attention is paid to keeping the hog houses\r\nclean and sanitary, light, sunny and dry. Dampness is always a fertile\r\nsource of loss. Further, the houses are never crowded. Each animal is\r\ngiven plenty of room.\r\n\r\nThe brood sows are placed in separate pens at farrowing time and watched\r\ncarefully when giving birth to the pigs. They are fed a rich slop, a\r\nsmall quantity at first, but in gradually increasing amount until they\r\nare receiving enough to insure a big flow of milk.\r\n\r\nWhen the pigs are eight to ten days of age they are permitted to go at\r\nwill to the self-feeder containing a mixture of ground grains. As a\r\nrule, several sows farrow at about the same time and the pens are so\r\narranged that the pigs from several litters may all use one feeder.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement results in the pigs taking more exercise, eating more\r\nfood and making more rapid growth. It reduces the danger of thumps and\r\ngives the youngsters a wonderfully strong start in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|              ~MORE PIGS PER HOG--MORE HOG PER PIG~                     |\r\n|                                                                        |\r\n|Big litters of strong-boned, growthy pigs, and rapid growth of pigs from|\r\n|birth to maturity are the natural result of health and vigor of breeding|\r\n|stock and youngsters.

A sample pig ration is made up as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  RATION FOR YOUNG PIGS\r\n\r\n  Winter wheat middlings         40   lbs.\r\n  Hominy meal                    40   lbs.\r\n  Oil meal                        3   lbs.\r\n  Whole oats (heavy)              5   lbs.\r\n  60 per cent. Digester tankage  12   lbs.\r\n  Fine salt                      1/2  lb.\r\n\r\nMix thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWhen the pigs are weaned they are placed with the herd, a safe practice\r\nbecause of the general contentment and quietness and the entire absence\r\nof meal-time stampedes. They quickly adjust themselves to their new\r\nsurroundings, and, because accustomed to the use of self-feeders, at\r\nonce begin eating the regular hog ration with the rest of the herd.\r\n\r\nIn the hog house, enough self-feeders are provided to permit all animals\r\nto eat at will without being crowded. One feeder to each twenty-five\r\nhogs is the rule.\r\n\r\nThe hog ration, like the pig ration, varies according to conditions. But\r\nat all times it is palatable and contains feeds which build bone, muscle\r\nand fat. A favorite formula is this:\r\n\r\n  RATION FOR GROWING HOGS\r\n\r\n  Winter wheat middlings         50 lbs.\r\n  Wheat bran                     50 lbs.\r\n  Corn chop                      50 lbs.\r\n  Whole oats                     10 lbs.\r\n  50 per cent. Digester tankage  20 lbs.\r\n\r\nSoft coal and salt are kept before the herd at all times. The hogs eat\r\nthese at will.\r\n\r\nThe grazing system is used on this farm. Many different forage crops are\r\nplanted, in order to insure a regular succession of succulent feeds. As\r\neach field reaches proper condition for grazing, a hog fence is thrown\r\naround it and the herd admitted. The hogs do all the work of harvesting,\r\nthus securing valuable exercise and at the same time saving man labor.\r\nUnder this system the fields have steadily improved in fertility, due to\r\nthe turning under of the uneaten green stuff and the direct application\r\nof the valuable hog manure.\r\n\r\nForage crops vary in different sections of the country. On the farm in\r\nquestion the earliest forage is rye, followed in rotation by the various\r\nclovers and mixtures of oats, Canada field peas, vetch, soy beans, etc.\r\nDwarf Essex rape is a favorite crop and one that furnishes a tremendous\r\namount of forage per acre.\r\n\r\nWhen the corn crop matures, the larger individuals are given the liberty\r\nof the corn fields and the crop is \"hogged down.\" This again saves a\r\ngreat amount of hand labor, a big item under existing conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, when grazing is out of the question, the herd receives\r\nonce daily a liberal feed of second crop alfalfa or clover hay.\r\n\r\nUnderstand, the feeders containing the dry mixture of ground grains, are\r\navailable to the hogs _at all times_. They help themselves at will, day\r\nand night.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _La Fontaine, Ind.\r\n\r\n     We have been trying to produce the largest hog in the world and we\r\n     have done it!

If the pen is old, knock it to pieces\r\nand burn it. Disinfect pens and sleeping places using Pratts Dip and\r\nDisinfectant on the floors, walls and ceilings. Whitewash everything. If\r\na hog dies from any cause, the carcass should never be exposed where it\r\nmay be devoured by the other hogs or by passing birds or beasts, but\r\nshould be burned at once or buried deeply and the pens thoroughly\r\ndisinfected immediately. If possible, do not move the carcass from the\r\nplace where it falls; but if this cannot be done the ground over which\r\nit is dragged should be disinfected. Hog-cholera bacilli can live in the\r\nground for at least three months. Care must be taken to maintain an\r\nabsolute quarantine between the sick and well hogs. The same attendant\r\nshould not care for both lots unless he disinfects himself thoroughly\r\nafter each visit to the infected hogs. Dogs should be confined until the\r\ndisease is stamped out.\r\n\r\nTreatment of hogs suffering from cholera or swine plague is not always\r\nsatisfactory. The disease runs its course so rapidly that curative\r\nmeasures are more or less ineffectual, and prevention of an outbreak\r\nshould be relied upon rather than the cure of sick animals. Pratts Hog\r\nTonic has been successful in less virulent outbreaks when administered\r\nas soon as signs of sickness are shown.\r\n\r\nPratts Hog Tonic should be thoroughly mixed with the feed, which should\r\nbe soft, made of bran and middlings, corn meal and middlings, corn meal\r\nand ground and sifted oats, or crushed wheat, mixed with hot water. If\r\nthe hogs are too sick to come to the feed, the tonic should be given as\r\na drench. Pull the cheek away from the teeth and pour the mixture in\r\nslowly. Care should be exercised, as hogs are easily suffocated by\r\ndrenching. Do not turn a hog on its back to drench it.\r\n\r\nHogs often suffer very much from vermin. Lice are introduced from\r\nneighboring herds, and the losses in feeding are often severe,\r\nespecially among young pigs, when death is sometimes a secondary if not\r\nan immediate result. When very numerous, lice are a very serious drain\r\non vitality, fattening is prevented, and in case of exposure to disease\r\nthe lousy hogs are much more liable to contract and succumb to it.\r\n\r\nNewly purchased hogs should be carefully examined for vermin, and they\r\nshould not be turned out with the herd until they are known to be free\r\nfrom these pests.\r\n\r\nWhen the herd is found to be badly infested with lice all bedding should\r\nbe burned and loose boards and partitions torn out. Old boards and\r\nrubbish should be burned. The quarters should then be thoroughly\r\ndisinfected by spraying with Pratts Dip and Disinfectant.\r\n\r\nVermin are most common around the ears, inside the legs, and in the\r\nfolds of the skin on the jowl sides and flanks. In light and isolated\r\ncases they may be destroyed by washing the hogs with Pratts Dip and\r\nDisinfectant, properly diluted, applied with a broom.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases, however, especially where the whole herd is affected,\r\nthorough spraying or dipping should be resorted to. In this case a\r\ndipping tank will be a great convenience.\r\n\r\nWhenever any animals are brought to the farm, or when animals are\r\nbrought home from shows or from neighboring farms, they should be kept\r\napart from the rest of the herd for at least three weeks. If they have\r\nbeen exposed to hog cholera or swine plague the diseases will be\r\nmanifested within this time, and the sick animals can be treated or\r\nkilled and disposed of at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Galway, N.Y.\r\n\r\n     I bought two spring pigs the 15th of April and began feeding them\r\n     Pratts Animal Regulator until the 15th of December when I butchered\r\n     them. One weighed 415 pounds, the other 420 pounds. I know this\r\n     Regulator does what you claim it to do.\r\n\r\n     BALDWIN O'BREY._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nIf cholera breaks out in the neighborhood the farmer should maintain a\r\nstrict quarantine against the infected herds. He should refrain from\r\nvisits to farms where they are located, and should insist on requiring\r\nthat his neighbors stay out of his hog lots. Visiting of all kinds at\r\nthis time should be carefully restricted. Dogs, cats, crows, and\r\nbuzzards are very active carriers of infection from farm to farm, and\r\nshould be guarded against as far as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRATTS PRACTICAL POINTERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n~COMMON DISEASES OF SWINE~\r\n\r\n(Symptoms and Treatment)\r\n\r\n\r\n~Diarrhoea or Scours~\r\n\r\n_Cause._--By milk of the dam being affected by feeding of food tainted\r\nwith the elements of decay; by making a sudden change in the food; by\r\nsome disordered condition in the health of the sow, and by excess of\r\nmilk furnished by the dam.\r\n\r\nUsually occurs before the weaning stage, as a rule in swine not yet ten\r\ndays old.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Very soft condition of the voidings which are sometimes\r\nalmost watery.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Being highly contagious, spray the floor thoroughly with\r\nPratts Disinfectant. Keep the young swine comfortable and remove the\r\nvoidings carefully two or three times a day. Correct the food given the\r\ndam, mixing Pratts Hog Tonic with her feed. Also give a small\r\ntablespoonful of sulphur daily to the sow.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hog Cholera and Swine Plague~\r\n\r\nHog Cholera and Swine Plague are very much alike. Both are characterized\r\nby inflammation of stomach and intestines, enlarged and inflamed\r\nlymphatic glands and sloughing of portions of the skin. The treatment\r\nand preventive measures are alike in many respects.\r\n\r\nThey are germ diseases, contracted in purchasing swine which may\r\ncontract the germs when in transit on cars; by exhibiting at fairs;\r\nthrough persons who have visited infected herds; through the feet of\r\ndogs and birds to which the germs may have adhered; through the water of\r\nan infected pond or stream.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous source of infection by far is coming in touch with\r\ndiseased animals.\r\n\r\nReduced stamina and filthy quarters favor the spread of these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Hog Cholera~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Dullness, loss of appetite or depraved appetite and a\r\ndisposition to lie down; constipation or diarrhoea; stiff gait; red\r\nspots or blotches discernible about the ears and under the neck and\r\nbelly; in some instances there is difficulty in breathing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Authorities agree that there is no known cure for real hog\r\ncholera. Preventive measures, therefore, are of vital importance. Pratts\r\nDisinfectant should be used frequently and to build up the general\r\nhealth of the hog, giving it full disease-resisting power, Pratts Hog\r\nTonic should be added to the ration. Besides, it is a valuable tonic and\r\nfattener.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Swine Plague~\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Extensive inflammation of the lungs, by which it can be\r\ndistinguished from hog cholera. There is coughing and labored, painful\r\nand oppressed breathing.\r\n\r\nIt frequently comes as a pneumonia or an inflammation of the lungs and\r\npleural membrane. The animal is in a sleepy and even comatose condition\r\nmuch of the time. If it walks it staggers. The skin reddens in a marked\r\ndegree and the bowels become constipated. This disease, though not\r\nnearly so common as hog cholera is usually very fatal. Preventive\r\nmeasures, as indicated for hog cholera, are all important. Use Pratts\r\nHog Tonic as directed and disinfect with Pratts Disinfectant.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Thumps~\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Too liberal feeding and lack of exercise, resulting in poor\r\ndigestion. The diaphragm contracts suddenly at irregular intervals, thus\r\ngiving the name to the disease. The pig becomes unthrifty and stunted.\r\nIf the sow is a liberal milker, nursing pigs may be affected. Treatment\r\nis usually preventive, consisting of exercise and careful feeding,\r\nPratts Hog Tonic being added to the feed.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Tuberculosis in Swine~\r\n\r\nThe losses from this disease are beginning to assume enormous\r\nproportions. It results largely from swine drinking the milk of\r\ntuberculous cattle.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Digestive disorders, such as diarrhoea and vomiting; a\r\nstunted condition and a staring coat and breathing more or less labored.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--There is no positive cure for this severe disease, but\r\ngood sanitation is the best preventive. Use Pratts Disinfectant freely\r\nand maintain health and vigor by regularly using Pratts Hog Tonic.\r\n\r\nThe importance of testing heads of cattle that may be affected with\r\ntuberculosis is thus further emphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Worms~\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no other animal troubled to so great an extent or with\r\nso many varieties of worms, as the hog. Indeed it is almost a rule with\r\nsome growers when a hog is sick and it cannot be told exactly what is\r\nthe matter that they doctor for worms.\r\n\r\nThere are four species of worms that live in the intestines of swine,\r\nresulting in more or less harm. The Common Round Worm, Pin Worm and Whip\r\nWorm develop from eggs taken in in food and water. The Thornheaded Worm\r\ndevelops from a white grub which swine eat. To a great extent these are\r\nkept in check by Pratts Hog Tonic.\r\n\r\nAs preventive measures, drain stagnant pools and wet places where these\r\neggs may be found; plough up yards and pastures; do not feed on floors\r\nnot properly cleaned, or on ground that may have been much used for such\r\nfeeding; do not give water from a deep well, do not allow the swine to\r\nwallow in the drinking trough.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Frequently a gluttonous appetite without corresponding\r\nimprovement in flesh. Again a much impaired appetite is found; diarrhoea\r\nor constipation; excessive itching, causing the animal to rub,\r\nespecially the hind parts. These symptoms will only exist when worms are\r\npresent in large numbers.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give each adult hog one heaping tablespoonful of Pratts\r\nWorm Powder with the feed once a day for four days. After the last dose\r\ngive a bran mash to loosen bowels.\r\n\r\nRepeat this treatment two weeks after the first to insure killing any\r\nworms which may have hatched in the meantime.\r\n\r\nEven if you are not sure that your hogs have worms--as they _probably_\r\nhave--you should use Pratts Worm Powder as above as a matter of\r\nprecaution.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Woodsboro, Md.\r\n\r\n     I bought four pigs, four months' old, weighing about 16 pounds\r\n     each, and, in bad condition.

And certainly this number of fowls, and many more,\r\ncan be easily and profitably maintained on the average farm. Easily,\r\nbecause under free range conditions, which are possible on the farm they\r\nrequire but little attention. Profitably, because under these\r\nconditions, where they pick up much of their living, the cost of\r\nproduction is comparatively low, while eggs and flesh sell at good\r\nprices. Further, these delicious and nutritious foods add variety to the\r\nfarm table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~BARRED PLYMOUTH ROCKS~]\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _South Easton, Mass.\r\n\r\n     I have used Pratts Poultry Regulator regularly.\r\n\r\n     The egg record for 900 fowls for five months the past winter was as\r\n     follows: Dec., 50%; Jan., 43%; Feb., 55%; March, 69%; April, 69%.\r\n     The lower record of January was caused by some pullets moulting.\r\n\r\n     Would say that fertility of eggs averaged 87% in December to over\r\n     90% later in the spring.\r\n\r\n     J.H.

WHITE LEGHORNS~]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Breeds of Poultry~\r\n\r\nRegardless of breeding and appearance, a heavy layer is a good hen to\r\nown. And laying ability is not confined to any one breed or class of\r\nfowls. There are exceptional layers, dependable profit-payers, in\r\npractically every fair-sized flock, whether made up of standard-bred\r\nstock or mongrels.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, however, standard-bred birds are best. By that term\r\nwe mean those which have been bred to meet the typical breed and variety\r\ndescriptions as appearing in the official Standard of Perfection which\r\nis published by the American Poultry Association. Such a flock is bound\r\nto be uniform in size, appearance and general characteristics, is easier\r\nto manage properly because of its uniformity, and its products, both\r\neggs and table poultry, will also be uniform. Further the income from\r\nsuch a flock may be increased through the sale of eggs for hatching and\r\nof breeding stock at prices many times greater than those of table eggs\r\nand poultry.\r\n\r\nNo matter what breed you select, the most important matter, the very\r\nfoundation of success, is the securing of _individual birds which are\r\nstrong, sturdy, vigorous and healthy_. Only stock of high vitality can\r\nbe depended upon to give continuously good results. It is time and money\r\nwasted to keep fowls which are weak, sickly or \"run-down,\" the result\r\nof improper breeding or management.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it is best to select that breed which is most popular\r\nlocally, because such popularity indicates that the breed in question\r\nthrives under local conditions and meets the requirements of the local\r\nmarkets. Further, one has greater opportunities of securing good birds\r\nand a larger market for hatching eggs and stock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~RHODE ISLAND REDS~]\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Clemson College, S.C.\r\n\r\n     We have been using Pratts Baby Chick Food and are very well pleased\r\n     with it.

HARE, Prof. of Poultry Husbandry._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the farmers whose markets demand white-shelled eggs, the S.C.\r\nWhite Leghorn is the most popular fowl. The Black Minorca is another\r\nfavorite. It produces the largest white eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOLMAN TYPE HOUSE]\r\n\r\nWhere brown-shelled eggs are wanted, the Plymouth Rock, Wyandotte, Rhode\r\nIsland Red and Orpington lead. And for the production of the largest\r\ntable carcasses the Light Brahma, either pure or crossed with a more\r\nactive breed, is a favorite. The live weights of adult birds of these\r\nbreeds are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Breed.              Cock.       Hen.\r\n\r\n  Leghorns           5 1/2 lbs.     4  lbs.\r\n  Black Minorcas     9  lbs.     7 1/2 lbs.\r\n  Plymouth Rocks     9 1/2 lbs.  7 1/2 lbs.\r\n  Wyandottes         8 1/2 lbs.  6 1/2 lbs.\r\n  Rhode Island Reds  8 1/2 lbs.  6 1/2 lbs.\r\n  Orpingtons        10  lbs.        8  lbs.\r\n  Light Brahmas     12  lbs.     9 1/2 lbs.\r\n\r\nMost of these breeds have varieties, determined by color of plumage or\r\nshape of comb. Select that one which best pleases you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNEVEN SPAN ROOF HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\n~Poultry Houses~\r\n\r\nWhen locating the poultry house remember that it is a great advantage to\r\nhave soil which is light and naturally well drained, since such soil\r\ndries off quickly after a rain and is \"much warmer,\" as poultrymen\r\nexpress it. Heavy soil, even stiff clay, may be made to serve the\r\npurpose admirably if provision is made to drain off all surface water.\r\nBut avoid a site on which water settles in pools, as the surface soon\r\nbecomes filthy and is a menace to the health of the flock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW JERSEY MULTIPLE UNIT HOUSE Two units combined to\r\nhouse two hundred fowls]\r\n\r\nThe birds should have the benefit of several hours of sunshine each day.\r\nSo locate the poultry house where the sun can strike it freely. The\r\nshelter of tall buildings on the north, or even on the east or west, is\r\nfrequently an advantage during the winter months, but the south side\r\nshould be open if conditions permit. Shade trees and large shrubs about\r\nthe house are a source of comfort to the fowls during hot weather and\r\nmay be used to screen or partially hide the poultry plant.\r\n\r\nThe poultry house must be dry, well-ventilated, free from draughts,\r\nlight, sunny and cheerful. And if it is planned with reference to the\r\nconvenience of the poultryman, so much the better. The most simple and\r\ninexpensive form of construction should be used. In all sections of the\r\ncountry, excepting the extreme north, a single wall of matched boards on\r\na light frame is perfectly satisfactory. Unmatched boards with battens\r\nnailed over the cracks or a layer of lightweight roofing paper over all\r\nare equally good. In fact, in case of necessity, one may use the\r\nroughest of lumber, and by covering the entire structure with roofing\r\npaper make a building which is tight and comfortable and acceptable in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe rear and end walls and roof must be _tight_ to insure dryness and\r\nprevent all draughts. Windows and doors may be placed in end walls, but\r\nthese should usually be located forward of the center of the building\r\nand made to fit snugly. The rear part of the house, where the roosts are\r\nlocated, must at all costs be protected against cross-currents of air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROOST]\r\n\r\nThe south or front walls, on the other hand, should have ample openings\r\nto admit air and sunshine. The open-front or fresh-air type of house is\r\nmuch superior to the old tightly closed type. Plenty of fresh air means\r\ncomfort, health, vitality and increased production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRATTS PRACTICAL POINTERS]\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                   \"~PRATTS MAKES HENS LAY~\"                            |\r\n|                                                                        |\r\n|~What is Pratts Poultry Regulator?~ A positive tonic and conditioner for|\r\n|poultry of all kinds and ages. _A health-builder and health-preserver._ |\r\n|Not a food.                                                             |\r\n|                                                                        |\r\n|~What does it contain?~ Roots, herbs, spices, mineral substances, etc.  |\r\n|Each ingredient performs a certain duty.

FLAHERTY._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIMPLE A-SHAPED HOUSE]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a quarter to a third of the front wall should be left open. Cover\r\nthe openings with one-inch mesh wire netting to keep the fowls in and\r\nrepel all enemies and food-seeking sparrows. Cloth-covered frames should\r\nbe provided to close these openings and keep out driving storms. The\r\ncloth, should be open in texture, as coarse cotton or heavy cheese\r\ncloth, not \"boardy\" and air-tight. Frames may be left loose to hook or\r\nbutton on inside or outside, or hinged to the top of the openings and\r\nswung up against the roof when not in use. In some cases, as in the\r\nTolman house, these openings are never closed, day or night, summer or\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to provide one or more glass windows in addition to the\r\nopenings referred to above in order to admit light when the\r\ncloth-covered frames are closed. The windows may be placed in either the\r\nfront wall or the side walls. In the latter case the sun is admitted to\r\nthe building more hours each day, which is a big advantage during the\r\nfall and winter months.\r\n\r\nPoultry house floors may be of cement, boards or earth. Cement is best\r\nfor large, permanent structures. Board floors are excellent in houses of\r\nany size and are almost a necessity in small ones which may be moved\r\nfrequently. Earth floors seem to be favored by the fowls, but if used\r\nthe earth should be filled in to bring the floor level several inches\r\nabove the surrounding ground. This to insure dryness.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cuts show typical designs of satisfactory poultry\r\nhouses. When building, just bear the above principles in mind and the\r\nresults will be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Tolman type is a strictly \"fresh air\" or \"open front\" house. For a\r\nflock of thirty to forty birds this house should be ten feet wide,\r\nsixteen feet front to back, seven feet to peak of roof, front wall four\r\nfeet and rear wall five feet high.

Almost immediately I notice their appetites improve,\r\n     their combs redden and they lay better. I have also made trial of\r\n     your other remedies and I find them all absolutely reliable.\r\n\r\n     JOHN S. MARTIN_\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a flock of one hundred or more birds the New Jersey Multiple Unit\r\nLaying House is to be recommended. Each unit is twenty feet square,\r\naccommodating a hundred fowls. Similar units may be added for each\r\nhundred additional birds. The drawing on page 48 shows two units.\r\n\r\nIn this house the front studs are nine feet high, rear studs are four\r\nand a half feet high.\r\n\r\nSimple, inexpensive furnishings are best. The cuts show home-made\r\nequipment which will meet all practical requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Getting the Eggs~\r\n\r\nEarly-hatched, well-matured pullets are the most dependable layers\r\nduring the fall and early winter months. Some few yearling hens may\r\ncontinue to lay fairly well during their molting period, but, as a rule,\r\negg production drops with the feathers and does not begin until the new\r\ncoat of plumage is completed and the system readjusted. So yearlings,\r\ntaken as a whole, do little toward filling the egg-basket until January\r\nor later.\r\n\r\nGet the early-hatched pullets into winter quarters by late September or\r\nearly October before they begin to lay. But be sure the house is fully\r\nprepared in advance. Clean house! Disinfect thoroughly with a strong\r\nsolution of Pratts Poultry Disinfectant. Kill every germ. Avoid possible\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Cherokee, Iowa.\r\n\r\n     I have used Pratts Poultry Regulator for the last twenty years and\r\n     always had the best of results. It is a great egg producer and the\r\n     best feed to keep little chicks strong and guard off that terrible\r\n     disease, bowel complaint. In fact, I cannot do without it.\r\n\r\n     GEO. WM. LYON._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n~Get Fall and Winter Eggs~\r\n\r\nIt is most desirable that the flock begin egg production before the\r\nweather becomes severe. Get the laying habit established while the\r\nseason is favorable, and it is comparatively easy to maintain it. And,\r\nas production will not commence until the layers are fully matured, the\r\npullets must be hatched early to give ample time for them to make the\r\nneeded growth.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, it takes about seven months to mature pullets of the general\r\npurpose breeds and six months for the egg breeds. Therefore, March and\r\nApril chicks of the former, and April and May chicks of the latter, are\r\nmost valuable. This is a general rule. Some poultrymen are experts in\r\nthis matter of growing chicks and can bring them to laying maturity in\r\nless time.\r\n\r\nIf disease appears take instant action to check it. Delay of a day or\r\ntwo may permit an epidemic to get well started. In order to enable you\r\nto give proper treatment without delay you may well keep a stock of\r\nPratts Poultry Remedies on hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLYING LICE POWDER]\r\n\r\nGive every bird a thorough treatment for lice. Work Pratts Powdered Lice\r\nKiller all through the plumage. This will fix the lice, but will not\r\nkill the eggs. In anticipation of the latter hatching, rub Pratts Lice\r\nSalve in the small feathers about the vent and beneath the wings. That\r\nmeans death to the young lice as they appear, but to make sure, apply\r\nthe salve at intervals of a few weeks.\r\n\r\nDon't overcrowd the house. Better have a hundred hens comfortable and\r\nlaying than double the number crowded and loafing.\r\n\r\nLeave all ventilating openings wide open. Keep them open until winter\r\nstorms make more protection necessary. During the summer months the\r\npullets have had plenty of fresh air. To bring them into a warm, tightly\r\nclosed house is to invite general debility and an epidemic of colds,\r\ncatarrh, roup and other allied diseases. (Pratts Roup Remedy dissolved\r\nin the drinking water every few days, especially during changes of\r\nweather, will help to prevent such troubles.)\r\n\r\nKeep the house clean. Remove the litter from the floor as soon as it\r\nbecomes damp or soiled and replace with new, fresh material. Clean the\r\ndroppings boards at frequent intervals. Wash with Pratts Poultry\r\nDisinfectant or scald the food and water dishes. Disinfect the whole\r\nhouse every few weeks, taking advantage of sunny weather so quick drying\r\nwill follow. Disease causes loss--disinfection prevents disease.\r\nTherefore, DISINFECT whether you see need of it or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Poultry Feeding~\r\n\r\nThe more food the birds eat beyond bodily requirements the greater the\r\namount of the salable products they create. Any hen that is a natural\r\nlayer will turn the surplus food into eggs. If she is naturally a meat\r\nproducer she will build flesh or take on fat. And the sooner the fat\r\nproducers are identified and removed from the laying flock, the better\r\nfor all concerned. Your birds will not \"get too fat to lay\"--they will\r\nget fat if they don't lay. And _the big problem is to induce the layers\r\nto eat as much food as they can digest_ in order that they may lay\r\nheavily and steadily.\r\n\r\nTo overcome all possible danger of overfeeding, Pratts Poultry Regulator\r\nshould be regularly added to the mash. This natural tonic and\r\nconditioner contains appetizers, to stimulate the desire for\r\nfood--digestives, to insure complete digestion and assimilation of the\r\nfood consumed--laxatives, to regulate the bowels--internal antiseptics,\r\nto keep the entire digestive tract in a condition of perfect\r\nhealth--worm destroyers, to expel irritating and dangerous intestinal\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\nRegularly used, Pratts Poultry Regulator insures freedom from the more\r\ncommon poultry disorders, reduces feed bills by preventing feed waste\r\ndue to sluggish digestion, hastens growth, improves the egg-yield,\r\nshortens the molt, makes the entire flock more efficient, swells the\r\nprofits.\r\n\r\nPratts Poultry Regulator should be added to the mash at the rate of one\r\nand three-quarters pound to each hundred pounds of mash. Mix thoroughly\r\nso each layer will get her share. The ideal poultry ration is a varied\r\none. It contains mineral matter, green food, animal food and grains. The\r\nabsence of any one of these groups of foodstuffs means a reduced egg\r\nyield.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _I am both selling and feeding Pratts Poultry Regulator, and make a\r\n     specialty of high-bred Buff Orpingtons. Twelve cockerels, worth\r\n     from $20 to $75 each, were all placed in healthy condition by use\r\n     of Pratts Poultry Regulator and their quarters disinfected with\r\n     Pratts Disinfectant.\r\n\r\n     W.H. TOPP, Westgate, Iowa._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe staple grain feeds are corn, oats, wheat, barley and buckwheat. The\r\ngrain by-products, bran, middlings and gluten feed, to which may be\r\nadded corn meal, ground oats and ground barley.\r\n\r\nAnimal food of some kind is an essential to growth and egg-production.\r\nSkim milk and butter milk, fish scrap made from oil-free fish, beef\r\nscrap, fresh cut green bone and good grades of digester tankage are all\r\nexcellent. But use only feeds of this character which are of prime\r\nquality. Oily fish, poor beef scrap and mouldy green bone will surely\r\ncause trouble.\r\n\r\nFowls on range during the growing season will pick up all needed green\r\nfood. In the winter one may feed cabbages, mangel wurtzels, beets,\r\ncarrots, etc. Or, if fresh stuff is not available, heavy oats may be\r\nsprouted and fed when the sprouts are two or three inches long. Dried\r\nbeet pulp, a dairy food made at beet sugar factories, is a convenient\r\ngreen food. It must be well soaked before feeding.\r\n\r\nOne saves much time, and not infrequently some money, by buying\r\nready-mixed feeds, especially dry mash. In, making such purchases, be\r\nguided by _quality_ rather than price. Adopt some brand made by a\r\nreputable concern and give it a fair trial. But do not hesitate to\r\nchange if a better brand becomes available. Just try Pratts Milk Egg\r\nMash.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Kingston, R.I.\r\n\r\n     I have used your Baby Chick Food with the best success and would\r\n     gladly recommend it to anyone wanting such food.

BRETT, Rhode Island State College Dept. of Poultry Service._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n~Feeding Dry Mash~\r\n\r\nThe most simple and generally satisfactory feeding method is the dry\r\nmash system. Feed a certain amount of the scratch mixture--whole and\r\ncracked grains--each day and permit the fowls to complete the daily\r\nration by eating dry mash--ground grains--at will. Keep mash before them\r\nin open hoppers and let them help themselves.\r\n\r\nThe mash, because of its high protein content, is the real egg-maker.\r\nAnd during recent years there has been a tendency toward restricting the\r\nscratch feed and inducing the layers to eat more mash. Results seem to\r\nindicate that this plan is best, increasing the yield and reducing feed\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\nThe laying ration now recommended by the New Jersey Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station is simple and efficient. This ration is made as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    ~Dry Mash~            lbs.\r\n\r\n  Wheat Bran              100\r\n  Wheat Middlings         100\r\n  Ground Oats (heavy)     100\r\n  Corn Meal               100\r\n\r\n  ~High-grade Fish Scrap or Meat~\r\n\r\n  Scrap                   100\r\n\r\n\r\n  ~Scratch Grain~         lbs.\r\n\r\n  Cracked Corn            200\r\n  Wheat                   100\r\n  Oats (heavy)            100\r\n  Barley                  100\r\n\r\nThe same institution has perfected the following feeding table showing\r\nwhat amount of scratch feed should be given the layers daily each month\r\nin the year. This is a most valuable guide, especially to the\r\ninexperienced poultryman. When the birds are fed scratch grain, as\r\nindicated, they will naturally eat enough mash from the open hoppers to\r\nmeet their requirements.\r\n\r\n  ~Amount of Grain to Feed Layers Each Month in the Year~\r\n\r\n  Months          Amount Per Day Per          Pounds For Each\r\n                       100 Birds                  Feeding\r\n                                          A.M.

For late markets and home\r\nuse, you may bring off hatches at intervals throughout the entire\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe incubator and brooder are big helps where many chicks are hatched.\r\nPratts Poultry Service Department will gladly advise you regarding makes\r\nof such machines which are giving general satisfaction.\r\n\r\nJust a word of caution. Operate incubators and brooders in accordance\r\nwith the directions furnished by the maker. Go slow in making changes.\r\n\r\nSitting hens are very satisfactory if properly handled. Use only quiet,\r\nmotherly sitters and place them where they will not be troubled by the\r\nrest of the flock. Feed whole grain and a little green food and supply\r\nplenty of water.\r\n\r\nDust the sitting hens occasionally with Pratts Powdered Lice Killer so\r\nthey won't hatch a brood of lice with the chicks. And paint the nest\r\nboxes with Pratts Red Mite Special to keep the blood-thirsty mites away.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Growing the Chicks~\r\n\r\nLittle chicks must be attended to no matter what else is done, because\r\nlack of intelligent care in early life will be reflected in poor\r\nperformance when the chicks reach maturity. One can seldom, if ever,\r\noffset the mistakes of brooding time by the best of attention later on.\r\n\r\nProtect your chicks against the weather, against their various enemies,\r\nagainst diseases, against lice and mites. Keep them comfortable and\r\nhappy. Start them right, keep them growing steadily until they attain\r\ntheir full size.\r\n\r\nProtection against unfavorable weather conditions--rain, cold winds,\r\nblazing sun--is secured by providing well-built coops and natural or\r\nartificial shade. Coops should be weather-proof, but well ventilated,\r\nand so located that surface water from sudden showers cannot flood their\r\nfloors. They should also be sufficiently roomy to keep the flock happy\r\nduring long hours of confinement in periods of stormy weather.\r\n\r\nChick enemies include those that do their work in the coops, usually at\r\nnight, as rats, weasels and skunks, and those that prey upon the flock\r\nwhen it is at liberty, as cats, dogs, crows and hawks.\r\n\r\nProtection against the former is found in proper construction of the\r\ncoops, which should have tight floors and fine wire netting over\r\nopenings left open at night. A good dog will discourage these night\r\nprowlers and steel traps placed at strategic points will often put a\r\nquick end to their activities.\r\n\r\nProtection against ordinary diseases lies in keeping the little birds\r\nstrong and vigorous through proper feeding, exercise, etc., and by close\r\nattention to sanitation. Keep the quarters and food and water dishes\r\n_clean_. Use Pratts Poultry Disinfectant at frequent intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A-SHAPED COOP]\r\n\r\nAim to _prevent_ rather than _cure_ disease. Should there be any\r\nevidence of bowel trouble, give Pratts White Diarrhoea Remedy in the\r\ndrinking water. Don't let the condition become chronic or general. In\r\n\"sour weather,\" when colds may be expected to appear, use Pratts Roup\r\nRemedy in the drinking water.\r\n\r\nLice and mites work practically unseen, but they are the source of heavy\r\nloss, both directly and indirectly. In extreme cases they actually kill\r\nmany chicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                  \"~BABY FOOD FOR BABY CHICKS~\"                        |\r\n|                                                                       |\r\n|~Pratts~ Buttermilk Baby Chick Food raises every good chick.

Rub a little of the mild preparation on\r\ntop of the head, under the throat and beneath the wings. At the same\r\ntime dust with Pratts Powdered Lice Killer. Treat the mother hens most\r\nthoroughly, substituting Pratts Lice Salve for the ointment. When the\r\nyoungsters are ten days old, treat them again, this time using the\r\nsalve. And repeat the treatment at reasonably frequent intervals to\r\ninsure complete freedom from the trouble makers.\r\n\r\nThe deadly blood-sucking mites do not live on the bodies of the birds,\r\nbut make their homes in cracks and crevices of walls and floors of the\r\ncoops. Attack them there. Clean coops carefully, then spray or wash\r\nwalls and floors with Pratts Red Mite Special. Repeat as necessary. That\r\nwill fix 'em. But you had best do the work on a bright, sunny day when\r\nthe flock can be kept outside until the coop dries.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Feeding the Chicks~\r\n\r\nDo not feed chicks for forty-eight hours after hatching. In fact, you\r\nmay safely wait until they are seventy-two hours old before giving them\r\ntheir first meal. Nature has provided for nourishment during this period\r\nand it is best not to upset things.\r\n\r\nIf possible, start the youngsters off on their life's journey with a\r\ndrink of _sour milk_. Let them have sour milk to drink exclusively for\r\nthe first ten days at least, and give it to them all through life, if\r\nthis excellent food drink is available.\r\n\r\nThe principal feed for the first three weeks and profitably for a much\r\nlonger time should be Pratts Buttermilk Baby Chick Food, a real \"baby\r\nfood for baby chicks,\" a mixture which is properly balanced in\r\ncomposition and in the right mechanical condition to insure quick\r\ndigestion. As chicks eat so little during this period, as measured by\r\npounds, one is fully justified in paying a relatively high price per\r\npound for this special feed which will give them a strong, vigorous\r\nstart and put their digestive organs in proper condition to efficiently\r\nuse less expensive foods when food consumption becomes heavy.\r\n\r\nThe ideal baby chick food, Pratts, is made of a variety of foodstuffs so\r\nblended as to supply, in proper proportion, the nutrients required to\r\nbuild flesh, bone and feather. It is ground exceedingly fine so it may\r\nbe consumed freely and yet not tax the digestive organs. Obviously such\r\na feed cannot satisfactorily be prepared at home, which explains the\r\nrapidly growing demand which has arisen for Pratts Buttermilk Baby Chick\r\nFood during recent years.\r\n\r\nFor the first day or two, feed Pratts Buttermilk Baby Chick Food\r\nexclusively at intervals of two to three hours. At first, spread it upon\r\na shingle or piece of board. Later place it in little troughs or shallow\r\ndishes. Let the chicks eat a reasonable amount, what they will take in\r\ntwenty to thirty minutes, then remove it. Supply a bit of fine, bright\r\ngrit during this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Rohrerstown, Pa.\r\n\r\n     I have used the Baby Chick Food this season and have had excellent\r\n     results.

State Poultry Association._\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second or third day after feeding has begun, cut out a meal or two\r\nof the baby chick food and instead sprinkle a little regulation chick\r\nfeed (scratch feed) in the litter. There are many good brands of such\r\nfeed on the market. If preferred, one may be made as follows:\r\n\r\n  ~Scratch Feed for Chicks~\r\n\r\n  Cracked Wheat        15 lbs.\r\n  Fine Cracked Corn    15 lbs.\r\n  Pinhead Oats         10 lbs.\r\n  Broken Rice           3 lbs.\r\n  Charcoal              2 lbs.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the second week the scratch feed may be given three\r\ntimes daily, just the quantity they will clean up and hunt for more, and\r\nthe baby chick food left in open hoppers or dishes to which the chicks\r\nmay run at will. By this time, too, grit may safely be left in open\r\nhoppers before the flock. And if milk is not given freely it is well to\r\nsupply some additional animal food each day. Fine fish scrap or beef\r\nscrap--always of high quality--may be fed sparingly in troughs or on\r\npieces of board. Do not feed too much of this material. If bowel trouble\r\ndevelops, reduce the quantity of animal food. The amount given may be\r\nincreased progressively as the youngsters gain in size.\r\n\r\nWhile Pratts Baby Chick Food need not be fed longer than the first three\r\nweeks, it is good practice to continue its use for two to three weeks\r\nlonger. But at any time after the critical twenty-one day period one may\r\nsafely begin to substitute a somewhat coarser and heavier developing or\r\ngrowing mash for the baby chick food. We advise the use of Pratts\r\nButtermilk Growing Mash. Here is a good home-made mixture:\r\n\r\n  ~Growing or Developing Mash~\r\n\r\n  Cornmeal                      10 lbs.\r\n  Wheat Bran                    20 lbs.\r\n  Feeding Flour                 10 lbs.\r\n  Fine Ground Oats, Sifted      10 lbs.\r\n  Fine Fish or Beef Scrap       10 lbs.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _\"The regular use of Pratts Poultry Regulator in the ration for\r\n     growing chicks prevents deaths from common disease, increases the\r\n     appetite and hastens growth. This means less loss, earlier laying\r\n     or market maturity, bigger profits.\r\n\r\n     P.G. PLATT, Sec. Delaware Co. Poultry Assn., Wallingford, Pa._\"\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nAt six to eight weeks of age, or as soon as the youngsters can\r\ncomfortably eat coarser grains, the fine scratch feed may be replaced by\r\na coarser mixture. Equal parts, by weight, of cracked corn and wheat,\r\nform the basis of this, with barley, heavy oats, kafir corn and\r\nbuckwheat added for variety if available at reasonable prices. When the\r\nflock is weaned and well feathered, the regular laying mash may be\r\nsubstituted for the growing mash, though the latter may well be\r\ncontinued for a much longer period.\r\n\r\nAbove all things, see to it that nothing but feed of superior quality is\r\nsupplied. Moldy, chaffy, grains and weed seeds may be _cheaper to buy_\r\nthan sweet, sound materials, but the latter are _cheaper to feed_.\r\n\r\nBegin giving green food when the chicks are three or four days old,\r\ncutting it up finely so they can eat it. And continue to feed greens\r\nliberally at all times. It's good for the health and cuts feed bills,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Care of the Growing Chicks~\r\n\r\nAs the chicks grow, provide larger quarters if the original coops are at\r\nall crowded. And teach the youngsters to roost early, especially where\r\nbrooders are used, so they will not \"pile up\" in corners when the heat\r\nis removed. When the brood is five to six weeks of age place low roosts,\r\nlath tacked on six to eight-inch boards, in the coops. The sturdier\r\nindividuals will soon learn to use them and educate the rest of the\r\nflock.\r\n\r\nPay special attention to the water supply. Have clean water available\r\nat all times. And do not leave the water dishes in the sun, which will\r\nquickly make the water so warm that it is unfit to drink.\r\n\r\nGive the growing pullets as much space, indoors and out, as you possibly\r\ncan. Feed them liberally. Keep them clean and comfortable. In every way\r\nhelp them gain the health, strength and vigor which they must have in\r\norder to do full duty in the laying and breeding pens.\r\n\r\nFinally, cull your flock without mercy, beginning at hatching time and\r\ncontinuing to the end. If any baby chicks are crippled or weak, dispose\r\nof them at once. As the flock grows, mark--by toe punching or\r\notherwise--all individuals which show evidence of being lacking in\r\nvigor, which are stunted or do not make rapid growth, which fail to\r\nfeather properly, which are ever noticeably sick. Then rush them to\r\nmarket as soon as they reach the proper weight. Thus you will save for\r\nyour own use only those which are physically right, which have the\r\nhealth and stamina that will enable them to stand up under the strain of\r\ncontinuous egg-production. And such a flock, after it has undergone the\r\nfurther culling of a year in the laying pen, will give you breeding\r\nbirds capable of producing worthwhile chicks.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Poultry Diseases~\r\n\r\nPrevention of disease is most essential. And the first step consists of\r\ncarefully selecting the birds which will he given a place in the flock,\r\nretaining only those which are healthy and vigorous, and rejecting the\r\nweaklings and physically unfit. The next step is to keep the birds in a\r\nhigh state of vitality through proper management and keep contagious and\r\ninfectious diseases away by adopting the necessary sanitary measures.\r\n\r\nFresh air, wholesome food and clean water are essential. Equally\r\nnecessary is the use of Pratts Poultry Regulator, which keeps the birds\r\nin perfect condition internally and so prevents such self-developed\r\ndisorders as indigestion, constipation, and the like.\r\n\r\nMost of the serious diseases which take heavy toll of carelessly managed\r\nflocks are due to germs of various kinds. These may be introduced in\r\nmany different ways, and when present in the flock they multiply and\r\nspread with great rapidity. Cleanliness and sanitation will largely\r\novercome them, and as each fowl is worth so much money under present\r\nconditions, it is really economical to prevent loss even at the expense\r\nof some time and of germ-killing preparations.\r\n\r\nPratts Poultry Disinfectant costs but a trifle. A gallon, diluted with\r\nwater, makes fifty gallons of a powerful disinfectant, one that is\r\nhighly efficient, but both safe and pleasant to use. Spray the house and\r\nfurnishings and wash feed and water containers at frequent intervals\r\nwith this economical germ-killer. Results will surely be seen in\r\nhealthier, more productive birds, less trouble and less loss from\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Staunton, Va.\r\n\r\n     I would not have tried to raise expensive poultry without Pratts\r\n     products in my house.

It is different and better than\r\nmany like preparations, being stronger, non-poisonous, has great\r\ndisinfecting qualities, and positively kills all kinds of chicken lice.\r\nIf you want to make money from your poultry you can't afford to be\r\nwithout it. Pratts Poultry Disinfectant, or the more powerful Pratts Red\r\nMite Special, should also be used in the poultry houses. Lice seek\r\ncrevices, cracks, openings, etc., that can only be reached by the\r\nliquid. This should be sprayed or sprinkled on perches, nest boxes, drop\r\nboards, floors and inside walls of all poultry houses. It not only kills\r\nlice, but has great disinfecting value. Do not accept a substitute.\r\n\r\nPratts Lice Salve is a sure-fire lice killer in another form. Apply to\r\nthe feathers beneath the wings and around the vent and quick results\r\nwill be noticed. A single application will be effective for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\n~Head Lice~--The big grey lice commonly found on heads of little chicks,\r\ncausing great mortality.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_--Keep on hand all the time a box of Pratts Head Lice\r\nOintment, and use it on your little chicks, and save their lives. Two or\r\nthree days before the brood should hatch, sprinkle the sitting hen\r\nthoroughly with Pratts Powdered Lice Killer.\r\n\r\n~Poultry Mites (Red Mites)~--These tiny parasites are poultry killers.\r\nThey do not live on the bodies of the birds, but in cracks and crevices\r\nof the building, coming out for their food. They suck the blood from the\r\nfowls, weakening and often killing them.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_--Look around roosts and in cracks in warm weather and you\r\nare apt to see hundreds of mites. Every week spray perches, dropping\r\nboards, sides of houses, and roof near perches with Pratts Red Mite\r\nSpecial; powder birds with Pratts Powdered Lice Killer, and also add\r\nthis to the dust bath.\r\n\r\n~Depluming Mites~--Parasites that attack the roots or base of feathers\r\nwhich break off leaving bare spots. Will quickly spread through an\r\nentire flock. Usually found in spring and summer.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_--Separate all affected birds from the rest of flock. Rub\r\nPratts Head Lice Ointment on and around the bare spots every few days,\r\nuntil the mites have all been destroyed. Spray houses, roofs, runs,\r\netc., with Pratts Poultry Disinfectant. Persistent treatment is\r\nnecessary to get rid of these pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n~THE MORE COMMON POULTRY DISEASES~\r\n\r\n~Symptoms and Treatment~\r\n\r\n~Apoplexy~--_Cause:_ Fowls too fat, general poor condition. _Symptoms:_\r\nParalysis, sudden death. Birds frequently found dead under roosts.\r\n_Treatment:_ Affected birds will not usually respond to treatment.\r\nFlocks should be treated to prevent further loss. Reduce the amount of\r\nfeed, give less corn, supply Pratts Poultry Regulator to improve general\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\r\n     -----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _Reading, Pa.\r\n\r\n     Have been using your poultry remedies for many years.
