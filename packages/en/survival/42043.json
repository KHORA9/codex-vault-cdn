It is addressed rather to that\r\nlarge class of readers to whom geology is only an incident in larger\r\nproblems, and who are not quite wholly satisfied with those explanations\r\nof the universe which are now commonly accepted on the testimony of\r\nbiological science. I am free to say that my own conviction of the\r\nhigher value and surer truth of other data outside of the biological\r\nsciences have always been given formative power in my own private\r\nopinions, and that in this way I have long held that there =must be\r\nsomething wrong= with the Evolution Theory, and also that there must be\r\na surer way of gauging the value of that Theory, even from the\r\nscientific standpoint, than the long devious processes connected with\r\nDarwinism and biology. Some years ago, when compelled to investigate the\r\nsubject more fully than I had hitherto done, I discovered, somewhat to\r\nmy own surprise, the phenomenal weakness of the geological argument. The\r\nresults of that investigation have grown into the present work.\r\n\r\nThough mostly critical and analytic, it is not wholly so. But so far as\r\nit is constructive there is one virtue which can rightly be claimed for\r\nit. It is at least an honest effort to study the foundation facts of\r\ngeology from the inductive may be standpoint, and whether or not I have\r\nsucceeded in this, it is, so far as I know, the only work published in\r\nthe English or any other language which does not treat the science of\r\ngeology more or less as a cosmogony.\r\n\r\nThat such a statement is possible is, I think, my chief justification in\r\ngiving it to the public. It would seem as if the twentieth century could\r\nafford at least one book built up from the present, instead of being\r\npostulated from the past.\r\n\r\n                                             GEORGE McCREADY PRICE.\r\n\r\n    257 South Hill Street,\r\n    Los Angeles, California,\r\n    June, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                PART I\r\n\r\n       I   THE ABSTRACT IDEA         11\r\n      II   HISTORY OF THE IDEA       14\r\n     III   FACT NUMBER ONE           20\r\n      IV   FACT NUMBER TWO           24\r\n       V   TURNED UPSIDE DOWN        27\r\n       V   FACT NUMBER FOUR          31\r\n     VII   EXTINCT SPECIES           34\r\n    VIII   SKIPPING                  42\r\n\r\n\r\n                PART II\r\n\r\n      IX   GRAVEYARDS                53\r\n       X   CHANGE OF CLIMATE         64\r\n      XI   DEGENERATION              70\r\n     XII   FOSSIL MEN                74\r\n    XIII   INDUCTIVE METHODS         81\r\n           APPENDIX                  89\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief outline of the argument which I have used in the following pages\r\nwill be in order here.\r\n\r\nDarwinism, as a part, the chief part, of the general Evolution Theory,\r\nrests logically and historically on the succession of life idea as\r\ntaught by geology. If there has actually been this succession of life on\r\nthe globe, then some form of genetic connection between these successive\r\ntypes is the intuitive conclusion of every thinking mind. But if there\r\nis no positive evidence that certain types are essentially older than\r\nothers, =if this succession of life is not an actual scientific fact=,\r\nthen Darwinism or any other form of evolution has no more scientific\r\nvalue than the vagaries of the old Greeks--in short, from the standpoint\r\nof true inductive science it is a most gigantic hoax, historically\r\nscarce second to the Ptolemaic astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn Part One I have examined critically this succession of life theory.\r\nIt is improper to speak of my argument as destructive, for there never\r\nwas any real constructive argument to be thus destroyed. It is\r\nessentially =an exposure=, and I am willing to =give a thousand dollars=\r\nto any one who will, in the face of the facts here presented, show me\r\nhow to prove that one kind of fossil is older than another.\r\n\r\nIn Part Two I have attempted to build up a true, safe induction in the\r\ncandid, unprejudiced spirit of a coroner called upon to hold a _post\r\nmortem_. The abnormal character of most of the fossiliferous deposits,\r\nthe sudden world-wide change of climate they record, the marked\r\ndegeneration in all organic forms in passing from the older to the\r\nmodern world, together with the great outstanding fact that human\r\nbeings, with thousands of other living species of animals and plants\r\nhave at this great world-crisis left their fossils in the rocks all over\r\nthe world, prove beyond a possible doubt that our once magnificently\r\nstocked world met with a tremendous catastrophe some thousands of years\r\nago, before the dawn of history. As for the =origin= of the living\r\nbeings that existed before that event, we can only suppose a =direct\r\ncreation=, since modern science knows nothing of the spontaneous\r\ngeneration of life, or of certain types of life having originated\r\n=before= other types, and thus being able to serve as =the source of\r\norigin= of other alleged succeeding types.\r\n\r\nWith the myth of a life succession dissipated once and for ever, the\r\nworld stands face to face with creation as the direct act of the\r\nInfinite God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE ABSTRACT IDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many of us have ever tried to think out a statement of just how we\r\nwould prove that there has been a succession of life on the globe in a\r\nparticular order?\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer did[1] and he did not seem to think the way in which it\r\nis usually attempted a very praiseworthy example of the methods to be\r\npursued in natural science.\r\n\r\nHe starts out with Werner, of Neptunian fame, and shows that the\r\nlatter's main idea of the rocks always succeeding one another over the\r\nwhole globe like the coats of an onion was \"untenable if analyzed,\" and\r\n\"physically absurd,\" for among other things it is incomprehensible that\r\nthese very different kinds of rocks could have been precipitated one\r\nafter another by the same \"chaotic menstrum.\"\r\n\r\nBut he then proceeds to show that the science is \"still swayed by the\r\ncrude hypotheses it set out with; so that even now, old doctrines that\r\nare abandoned as untenable in theory, continue in practice to mould the\r\nideas of geologists, and to foster sundry beliefs that are logically\r\nindefensible.\"\r\n\r\nWerner had taken for his data the way in which the rocks happened to\r\noccur in \"a narrow district of Germany,\" and had at once jumped to the\r\nconclusion that they must always occur in this relative order over the\r\nentire globe. \"Thus on a very incomplete acquaintance with a thousandth\r\npart of the earth's crust, he based a sweeping generalization applying\r\nto the whole of it.\"\r\n\r\nWerner classified the rocks according to their mineral characters, but\r\nwhen the fossils were taken as the prime test of age, the \"original\r\nnomenclature of periods and formations\" kept alive the original idea of\r\ncomplete envelopes encircling the whole globe one outside each other\r\nlike the coats of an onion. So that now, instead of Werner's successive\r\nages of sandstone making or limestone making, and successive suites of\r\nthese rocks, we have successive ages of various types of life, with\r\nsuccessive systems or \"groups of formations which everywhere succeed\r\neach other in a given order; and are severally everywhere of the same\r\nage. Though it may not be asserted that these successive systems are\r\nuniversal, yet it seems to be tacitly assumed that they are so....\r\nThough, probably, no competent geologist would contend that the European\r\nclassification of strata is applicable to the globe as a whole; yet\r\nmost, if not all geologists, write as though it were so.\"\r\n\r\nSpencer then goes on to show how dogmatic and unscientific it is to say\r\nthat when the Carboniferous flora, for example, existed in some\r\nlocalities, this type of life and this only must have enveloped the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"Now this belief,\" he says, \"that geologic 'systems' are universal, is\r\nquite as untenable as the other. It is just as absurd when considered _a\r\npriori_: and it is equally inconsistent with the facts,\" for all such\r\nsystems of similar life-forms must in olden time have been of merely\r\n\"local origin,\" just as they are now. In other words, we have no\r\nscientific knowledge of a time in the past when there were not\r\nzoological provinces and zones as there are to-day, one type of life\r\nexisting in one locality, while another and totally different type\r\nexisted somewhere else.\r\n\r\nThen, after quoting from Lyell a strong protest against the old fancy\r\nthat only certain types of sandstone and marls were made at certain\r\nepochs, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, while in this and numerous passages of like implication,\r\nSir C. Lyell protests against the bias here illustrated, he seems\r\nhimself not completely free from it. Though he utterly rejects the old\r\nhypothesis that all over the earth the same continuous strata lie upon\r\neach other in regular order, like the coats of an onion, he still writes\r\nas though geologic 'systems' do thus succeed each other. A reader of his\r\n'Manual' would certainly suppose him to believe, that the Primary epoch\r\nended, and the Secondary epoch commenced, all over the world at the same\r\ntime.... =Must we not say that though the onion-coat hypothesis is dead,\r\nits spirit is tractable, under a transcendental form, even in the\r\nconclusions of its antagonists.=\"\r\n\r\nSpencer then examines at considerable length the kindred idea that the\r\nsame or similar species \"lived in all parts of the earth at the same\r\ntime.\" \"This theory,\" he says, \"is scarcely more tenable than the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\nHe then shows how in some localities there are now forming coral\r\ndeposits, in some places chalk, and in others beds of Molluscs; while in\r\nstill other places entirely different forms of life are existing. In\r\nfact, each zone or depth of the ocean has its particular type of life,\r\njust as successive altitudes do on the sides of a mountain; and it is a\r\ndogmatic and arbitrary assumption to say that such conditions have not\r\nexisted in the past.\r\n\r\n\"On our own coasts, the marine remains found a few miles from shore, in\r\nbanks where fish congregate, are different from those found close to the\r\nshore, where only littoral species flourish. A large proportion of\r\naquatic creatures have structures that do not admit of fossilization;\r\nwhile of the rest, the great majority are destroyed, when dead, by the\r\nvarious kinds of scavengers that creep among the rocks and weeds. So\r\nthat no one deposit near our shores can contain anything like a true\r\nrepresentation of the fauna of the surrounding sea; much less of the\r\nco-existing faunas of other seas in the same latitude; and still less of\r\nthe faunas of seas in distant latitudes. Were it not that the assertion\r\nseems needful, it would be almost absurd to say that the organic remains\r\nnow being buried in the Dogger Bank can tell us next to nothing about\r\nthe fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and corals that are now being buried in\r\nthe Bay of Bengal.\"\r\n\r\nThis author evidently found it difficult to keep within the bounds of\r\nparliamentary language when speaking of the absurd and vicious reasoning\r\nat the very basis of the whole current geological theory; for, unlike\r\nthe other physical sciences, the great leading ideas of geology are not\r\ngeneralisations framed from the whole series or group of observed facts,\r\nbut are really abstract statements supposed to be reasonable in\r\nthemselves, or at the most =very hasty conclusions based on wholly\r\ninsufficient data=, like that of Werner in his \"narrow district of\r\nGermany.\" Sir Henry Howorth[2] has well expressed the urgent need that\r\nthere is of a complete reconstruction of geological theory:\r\n\r\n    \"It is a singular and a notable fact, that while most other branches\r\n    of science have emancipated themselves from the trammels of\r\n    metaphysical reasoning, the science of geology still remains\r\n    imprisoned in _a priori_ theories.\"\r\n\r\nBut Huxley[3] also has left us some remarks along the same line which\r\nare almost equally helpful in showing the essential absurdity of the\r\nassumption that when one type of life was living and being buried in one\r\nlocality another and very diverse type could not have been doing the\r\nsame things in other distant localities.\r\n\r\nThis is how he expresses it:\r\n\r\n\"All competent authorities will probably assent to the proposition that\r\nphysical geology does not enable us in any way to reply to this\r\nquestion--Were the British Cretaceous rocks deposited at the same time\r\nas those of India, or were they a million of years younger, or a million\r\nof years older?\"\r\n\r\nThis phase of the idea, however, is not so bad, for the human mind\r\nrefuses to believe that distant and disconnected groups of similar forms\r\nwere not connected in time and genetic relationship. It is really the\r\nreverse of this proposition that contains the most essential absurdity,\r\nand this is the very phase that is most essential to the whole\r\nsuccession of life idea. Huxley, indeed, seems to have caught a glimpse\r\nof this truth, for he says:\r\n\r\n\"A Devonian fauna and flora in the British Islands =may= have been\r\ncontemporaneous with Silurian life in North America, and with a\r\nCarboniferous fauna and flora in Africa. =Geographical provinces and\r\nzones may have been as distinctly marked in the Palaeozoic epoch as at\r\npresent.=\"\r\n\r\nCertainly; but if this be true, it is equally certain that the\r\nCarboniferous flora of Pennsylvania may have been contemporaneous alike\r\nwith the Cretaceous flora of British Columbia and the Tertiary flora of\r\nGermany and Australia. But in that case what becomes of this succession\r\nof life which for nearly a century has been the pole star of all the\r\nother biological sciences--I might almost say of the historical and\r\ntheological as well?\r\n\r\nMust it not be admitted that in any system of clear thinking this whole\r\nidea of there having really been a succession of life on the globe is\r\nnot only =not proved= by scientific methods, but that it is essentially\r\nunprovable and absurd?\r\n\r\nHuxley, in point of fact, admits this, though he goes right on with his\r\nscheme of evolution, just as if he never thought of the logical\r\nconsequences involved. His words are:\r\n\r\n\"In the present condition of our knowledge and of our methods (_sic_)\r\none verdict--'=not proven and not provable='--must be recorded against\r\nall grand hypotheses of the palaeontologist respecting the general\r\nsuccession of life on the globe.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of these startling facts, is it not amazing to see the\r\nsupernatural knowledge of the past continually and quietly assumed in\r\nevery geological vision of the earth's history?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"Illogical Geology; Illustrations of Universal Progress,\" pp.\r\n    329-380; D. Appleton & Co., 1890.\r\n\r\n[2] \"The Glacial Nightmare and the Flood,\" Preface VII.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Discourses Biol. and Geol.,\" pp. 279-288.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE IDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the few stray principles that the future will probably be able to\r\nsave from the wreck of Spencer's philosophy, is the advisability of\r\nlooking into =the genealogy of an idea=. What has been its surroundings?\r\nWhat is its family history? Does it come of good stock, or is its family\r\nlow and not very respectable?\r\n\r\nThis is especially true in the case of a scientific idea, which above\r\nall others needs to have a clean bill of health and a good family\r\nrecord. But, unfortunately, the idea we are here considering has a bad\r\nrecord, very bad in fact; for the whole family of Cosmogonies, of which\r\nthis notion is the only surviving representative, were supposed to have\r\nbeen banished from the land of science long ago, and were all reported\r\ndead. Some of them had to be executed by popular ridicule, but most of\r\nthem died natural deaths, the result of inherited taint, in the latter\r\npart of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. It is perfectly\r\nastonishing how any of the family could have survived over into the\r\ntwentieth century, in the face of such an antecedent record.\r\n\r\nFor one of the chief traits of the family as a whole is that of mental\r\ndisorder of various stages and degrees. Some of them were raving crazy;\r\nothers were mild and comparatively harmless, except that their drivel\r\nhad such a disturbing effect on scientific investigations that they had\r\nto be put out of the way. It seems such a pity that when this last\r\nfellow, early in life, was up before Doctors Huxley and Spencer for\r\nexamination, he was not locked up or put in limbo forthwith. This is\r\nespecially unfortunate, because this survivor of an otherwise extinct\r\nrace has since then produced a large family, some of which it is true\r\nhave already expired, while the eldest son, Darwinism, was reported in\r\n1901 to be \"at its last gasp,\"[4] and was even said last year to have\r\nhad its \"tombstone inscription\" written by von Hartmann of Germany. But\r\nthe succession of life idea itself, the father of all this brood, is\r\nstill certified by those in authority to be healthy and _compos mentis_.\r\n\r\nThe Cosmogony Family is a very ancient one, running back to the time of\r\nPlato and Thales of Miletus. Indeed the cuneiform inscriptions of\r\nBabylonia seem to indicate that a tribe with very similar\r\ncharacteristics existed several millenniums before the Christian era.\r\nBut discarding all these, the first men that we need to mention are\r\nperhaps Burnet and Whiston, who knew no other way of arriving at\r\ngeological truth than to spin a yarn about how the world was made.\r\nWoodward seems to have had a little better sense, and is named along\r\nwith Hooke and John Ray as one of the real founders of the science.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the brood of Cosmogonists was not dead, for Moro and De\r\nMaillet were at this same period spinning their fantastic theories about\r\nthe origin of things; or as Zittel puts it, \"accepted the risks of\r\nerror, and set about explaining the past and present =from the\r\nsubjective standpoint=.\"[5] This tendency we will find to be a birthmark\r\nin the family, and will serve to invariably identify any of them\r\nwherever found. We must remember this, and apply the test to the modern\r\nsurvivors.\r\n\r\nBuffon seems to have been really the founder of the family in the modern\r\nform. He is credited with the sarcastic remark that \"geologists must\r\nfeel like the ancient Roman augurs who could not meet each other without\r\nlaughing;\" though in view of his fantastic scheme of seven \"epochs,\" in\r\nwhich he endeavors to portray \"the beginning, the past, and the future\r\n(_sic_) of our planet,\"[6] one is reminded of the common symptom which\r\nmanifests itself in thinking all the rest of the world crazy.\r\n\r\nThe \"Heroic Age of Geology\" succeeded this period, and was characterized\r\nlargely by a determination to discard speculation, and to seek to build\r\nup a true science of actual fact and truth.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen from Spencer's remarks that A. G. Werner, who was,\r\nhowever, one of the leaders in Germany at this time, was very far from\r\nfollowing true inductive methods. And the following language of Sir\r\nArch. Geikie shows that in him the family characteristics were decidedly\r\nprominent:\r\n\r\n\"But never in the history of science did a stranger hallucination arise\r\nthan that of Werner and his school, when they supposed themselves to\r\ndiscard theory and build on a foundation of accurately-ascertained fact.\r\nNever was a system devised in which theory was more rampant; theory,\r\ntoo, unsupported by observation, and, as we now know, utterly erroneous.\r\nFrom beginning to end of Werner's method and its applications,\r\nassumptions were made for which there was no ground, and these\r\nassumptions were treated as demonstrable facts. =The very point to be\r\nproved was taken for granted=, and the geognosts, who boasted of their\r\navoidance of speculation, were in reality among the most hopelessly\r\nspeculative of all the generations that had tried to solve the problem\r\nof the theory of the earth.\"[7]\r\n\r\nIn fact this author says that:\r\n\r\n\"The Wernerians were as certain of the origin and sequence of the rocks\r\nas if they had been present at the formation of the earth's crust.\" (pp.\r\n288-9.)\r\n\r\nHere we see the family characteristics very strongly developed.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of Werner's five successive \"suites\" or onion-coats in which\r\nhe wrapped his embryo world, Zittel complains:\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, Werner's field observations were =limited to a small\r\ndistrict=, the Erz mountains and the neighboring parts of Saxony and\r\nBohemia. And his chronological scheme of formations was founded upon the\r\nmode of occurrence of the rocks within these narrow confines.\" (p. 59.)\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as we have seen, it is precisely such a charge as this that\r\nSpencer and Huxley bring against the modern phase of the doctrine of\r\nsuccessive ages based on the succession of life idea. Werner, from\r\nobservations \"limited to a small district,\" constructed his scheme of\r\nexact chronological sequence, basing it entirely upon the mineral or\r\nmechanical character of his \"suites.\" And hundreds of enthusiastic\r\nfollowers long declared that the rocks everywhere conformed to this\r\nclassification, even so great an observer as von Humboldt thinking that\r\nthe rocks which he examined in Central and South America fully confirmed\r\nWerner's chronological arrangement.\r\n\r\nBut such notions to-day only cause a smile of pity, for it is now well\r\nknown that, take the world over, =the rocks do not occur= as Werner\r\nimagined, though, as Geikie says, he and his disciples were as certain\r\nof the matter \"as if they had been present at the formation of the\r\nearth's crust.\" Besides, as already pointed out, we moderns ought now to\r\nhave pretty well assimilated the idea that while one kind of mineral or\r\nrock was forming in one locality, =a totally different kind of deposit=\r\nmay have been in process of formation in another spot some distance off\r\n=at the very same time=, and we cannot imagine a time in the past when\r\nthis principle would not hold good. But in a precisely similar way the\r\nidea of a time value was, as we shall see, transferred from the\r\nmechanical and mineral character of the rocks to their fossil contents;\r\nand from observations again \"limited to a small district,\" William Smith\r\nand Cuvier conceived the idea that the fossils occurred =only= in a\r\ncertain order; that only certain fossils lived at a certain time; that,\r\nfor example, while Trilobites were living and dying in one locality,\r\nNummulites or Mammals positively were not living and dying in another\r\nlocality, though in any system of clear thinking this latter notion is\r\njust as irrational as that of Werner. Hence Spencer is compelled to say,\r\n\"though the onion-coat hypothesis is dead, its spirit is still\r\ntraceable, under a transcendental form, even in the conclusions of its\r\nantagonists.\"\r\n\r\nThe two cases are exactly parallel; only it has taken us nearly a\r\nhundred years, it seems, to find out that the fossils do not follow the\r\nprearranged order of Smith and Cuvier any better than the rocks and\r\nminerals do the scheme of Werner. If hundreds of geologists still seem\r\nto think that the fossils in general agree with the standard order, we\r\nmust remember how many sharp observers said the same thing for decades\r\nabout Werner's scheme. The taint of heredity will always come out sooner\r\nor later; and both of these schemes exhibit very strongly the family\r\nhistory of the whole tribe of Cosmogonies, viz., =the facts refuse to\r\ncertify that they are of sound mind=.\r\n\r\nIt was William Smith, an English land surveyor, who first conceived the\r\nidea of fixing the relative ages of strata by their fossils. Just how\r\nfar he carried this idea it seems difficult to determine exactly.\r\nLyell[8] says nothing along this line about him, save that he followed\r\nthe leading divisions of the Secondary strata as outlined by Werner,\r\nthough he claims \"independently\" of the latter. Whewell[9] remarks\r\nrather pityingly on his having had \"no literary cultivation\" in his\r\nyouth, but has nothing about the degree in which he is responsible for\r\nthe modern scheme of life succession of which many modern geologists\r\nhave made him the \"father\". Geikie and Zittel are much more explicit.\r\nThe former[10] says that \"he had reached early in life the conclusions\r\non which his fame rests, and he never advanced beyond them.\" \"His plain,\r\nsolid, matter-of-fact intellect never branched into theory or\r\nspeculation, but occupied itself wholly in the observation of facts.\"\r\nZittel[11] says pretty much the same thing, remarking that \"Smith\r\nconfined himself to the empirical investigation of his country, and was\r\nnever tempted into general speculations about the history of the\r\nformation of the earth\"--words which to my mind are the very highest\r\npraise, for they seem to indicate that he was only in a very limited way\r\nresponsible for the unscientific and illogical scheme of a \"phylogenic\r\nseries\" or complete \"life-history of the earth,\" which now passes as the\r\nscience of geology. Doubtless like his little bright-eyed German\r\ncontemporary, A. G. Werner, he had not had his imagination sufficiently\r\ncultivated in his youth to be able to appreciate the beauty of first\r\nassuming your premises and then proving them by means of your\r\nconclusion, i.e., first assuming that there has been a gradual\r\ndevelopment on the earth from the lowest to the highest, and then\r\narranging the fossils from scattered localities over the earth in such a\r\nway that they cannot fail to testify to the fact.\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as a fair statement of what he actually\r\naccomplished and taught:\r\n\r\n\"After his long period of field observations, William Smith came to the\r\nconclusion that one and the same succession of strata stretched through\r\nEngland from the south coast to the east, and that each individual\r\nhorizon could be recognized by its particular fossils, that certain\r\nforms reappear in the same beds in the different localities, and that\r\neach fossil species belongs to a definite horizon of rock.\"[12]\r\n\r\nBut even granting the perfect accuracy of this generalization of Smith's\r\nfor the rocks which he examined, I fail to see how it is any better than\r\nWerner's scheme, which Zittel characterizes as \"weak\" and premature, and\r\nof which Whewell (p. 521) says that \"he promulgated, as respecting the\r\nworld, a scheme collected from a province, and even too hastily gathered\r\nfrom that narrow field.\"\r\n\r\nQuoting again from Zittel's criticism of Werner's work (\"Hist. of\r\nGeology,\" p. 59), we must admit that Smith's observations also were\r\n\"limited to a small district,\" and \"his chronological scheme of\r\nformations was founded upon the mode of occurrence of the rocks\r\n(fossils) within these narrow confines.\" There is, as we have shown, a\r\nmonstrous jump from this to the conclusion that =even these particular\r\nfossils= must always occur in this particular relative order over the\r\nwhole earth. How can any one deny that if we had a complete collection\r\nof all the fossils laid down during the last thousand years--when all\r\nadmit that the so-called \"phylogenic series\" is complete--particular\r\nfossils would in many cases be found to occur only in particular rocks,\r\nand we could still arrange them in this same order from the lowest to\r\nthe highest forms of life, while we might even happen to find \"small\r\ndistricts\" where the \"mode of occurrence of the rocks within these\r\nnarrow confines\" would have all the appearance of showing a true\r\n\"phylogenic\" order. This of itself ought to be sufficient to show us\r\nthe weakness of this subjective method of study, and the purely\r\nhypothetical and imaginary value of the fossils in determining the real\r\nage of a rock deposit.\r\n\r\nThe name of Baron Cuvier is the next that we have to consider. An\r\nexamination of part of his teaching will come naturally a little later\r\nwhen considering \"extinct species.\" That part of his work which related\r\nto the doctrine of Catastrophism is somewhat aside from the subject of\r\nour study; while with regard to his influence on the succession of life\r\nidea _per se_ there is not very much that need be said. And yet Cuvier\r\nis the real founder of modern cosmological geology, and thus in a\r\ncertain sense the father of biological evolution.\r\n\r\nBut if the absence of the architectonic mania for building a cosmogony\r\nwill serve to remove in a great measure any suspicions with regard to\r\nWilliam Smith's results, we cannot say the same for those of Cuvier. In\r\nhis scheme the hereditary Cosmological taint, which is such an\r\ninvariable characteristic of the family, is very strong, though\r\ndisguised and almost transfigured by learning and genius. It is\r\ndoubtless these latter qualities which have secured for the theory such\r\na phenomenal length of life, though of course we know that nothing born\r\nof this whole brood can ever secure a permanent home in the kingdom of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n\"How glorious,\" wrote this otherwise truly great man in his famous\r\n\"Preliminary Discourse,\" \"it would be if we could arrange the organized\r\nproducts of the universe in their chronological order, as we can already\r\n(Werner's onion-coats) do with the more important mineral substances!\"\r\n\r\nHis work (with that of his co-laborer Brongniart) on the fossils of the\r\nParis basin was probably accurate and logical enough for that limited\r\nlocality. It was only when he quietly assumed as Werner had done, that\r\nthe rocks must always occur in this particular order all over the world,\r\nor as Whewell expresses it, \"promulgated as respecting the world, a\r\nscheme collected from a province, and (perhaps) even too hastily\r\ngathered from that narrow field\"--it was only, I say, when this\r\nmonstrous assumption was incorporated into his scheme, and he began to\r\ncall into being his vision of organic creation on the instalment plan,\r\nas Werner had done with the minerals, that his great and valuable work\r\nfor science became tainted with the deadly Cosmological virus, dooming\r\nit to death sooner or later. Sherlock Holmes might attempt to diagnose a\r\ndisease by a mere glance at his patient's boots, but even this gave him\r\nmore data and was a more logical proceeding than the facts and methods\r\nof Cuvier supplied for constructing a scheme of organic creation.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to detail the manner in which the modern\r\n\"phylogenic series\" was gradually pieced together from the scattered\r\nfragments here and there all over the globe; but it should be noted here\r\nthat the whole chain of life was practically complete before any serious\r\nattempt was made to study the rocks on the top of the ground, and to\r\nfind out how this marvellous record of the past =joined on to the modern\r\nperiod=, thus reversing completely the true inductive method, and\r\nleaving the most important of all, viz., the rocks containing human\r\nremains and other living species, over till the last, with the result\r\nthat we have for over half a century been laboring under a \"Glacial\r\nNightmare,\" and these deposits on the top of the ground \"still remain in\r\nmany respects the despair of geology.\"\r\n\r\nThen came Lyell, Agassiz, and Darwin; and now in the light of the keen\r\ndiscussions instituted by Weismann in the later eighties of the last\r\ncentury, the modern world is pretty well agreed on two results, viz.,\r\nthat so far from natural selection being able to originate a species, it\r\ncan't possibly =originate= anything at all, and also that no individual\r\ncan transmit to his descendants what he has himself acquired in his\r\nlifetime, and hence it is hard to see how he can transmit what he has\r\nnot got himself and what none of his ancestors ever had.\r\n\r\nI have not the space to show how Agassiz further complicated the problem\r\nimmensely by his absurdly illogical use of his three \"laws\" of\r\ncomparison, when the prime fact of there ever having been a succession\r\nof life on the globe in any order whatever had never been proved; but I\r\nam free to say that if Cuvier's system of creation on the instalment\r\nplan had been fact instead of fancy, some scheme of evolution would\r\nundoubtedly be implied in this general fact. It is this instinctive\r\nfeeling on the part of modern scientists which makes them to-day, while\r\nconfessing the failure of Darwinism, still cling to the general idea of\r\nevolution =somehow=. Hence it seems quite evident that, having deviated\r\nfrom strict inductive methods by pursuing this _ignis fatuus_ of a\r\ncosmological history of creation, it was essential in the interests of\r\ntrue science to go the whole journey and make a complete investigation\r\nof the biological side of the question, in order to complete the\r\ndemonstration that science was on a wrong tack entirely. Darwin and\r\nWeismann were inevitable in view of the wholly unscientific course on\r\nwhich biology entered under the guidance of Buffon and Cuvier.\r\n\r\nWhat then can we take as the general lesson to be learned from the\r\nstubborn way in which, for over a hundred years, the world has followed\r\nthis hypnotic suggestion of folly, that we might explain our genesis and\r\nbeing from the scientific standpoint? One of the lessons--there may be\r\nothers--is that =science knows nothing about origins=, and that, in\r\nspeculating along these lines, the cosmological taint will always\r\nvitiate the accuracy of our conclusions and debauch the true spirit of\r\ninduction. A hundred years ago, they thought they knew all about how the\r\nworld was made. The keen investigations inspired by Darwinism were\r\nnecessary to convince us that we know nothing at all about it. Modern\r\nbiology has simply developed a gigantic _reductio ad absurdum_ argument\r\nagainst the easy assumptions of the earlier geologists that it occurred\r\nby a progression from the low to the high. A hundred years--nay fifty\r\nyears ago--this assumption did not appear so unscientific, for we did\r\nnot then have the biological evidence to refute such an idea. Now,\r\nhowever, in the light of the modern progress of science, this awful\r\nmystery of our existence, of our creation and destiny, is borne in upon\r\nus from every dividing cell, from every sprouting seed, from countless\r\nmillions of the eloquent voices of nature, which our forefathers were\r\ntoo blind to see, too deaf to understand; and with weary, reluctant\r\nsadness does science confess that about it all she knows absolutely\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] Nature, Nov. 28, 1901, pp. 76, 77.\r\n\r\n[5] \"History of Geology,\" p. 23.\r\n\r\n[6] Zittel, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[7] \"Founders of Geology,\" p. 112; Johns Hopkins Press, 1901.\r\n\r\n[8] \"Principles,\" p. 50, 8th Ed.\r\n\r\n[9] \"History of the Inductive Sciences,\" vol. ii., p. 521.\r\n\r\n[10] \"Founders of Geology,\" pp. 237-8.\r\n\r\n[11] \"History,\" p. 112.\r\n\r\n[12] Zittel, \"History,\" p. 110.

We have seen that it is really based on two\r\nprimary assumptions, viz.:\r\n\r\n(1) That over all the earth the fossils =must always occur= in the\r\nparticular order in which they were found to occur in a few corners of\r\nWestern Europe; and also--\r\n\r\n(2) That in the long ago =there were no such things as zoological\r\nprovinces and zones=, and totally different types of fossils from\r\nseparated localities could not possibly have been contemporaneous with\r\none another as we know they are to-day in \"recent\" deposits.[13]\r\n\r\nOn the blending of these two assumptions, the latter essentially absurd,\r\nand the former long ago disproved by the facts of the rocks, has been\r\nbuilt up the towering structure of a complete \"phylogenic series\" from\r\nthe Cambrian to the Pleistocene. The way in which, as we have been,\r\nSpencer and Huxley treated this subject, reminds us very much of the old\r\nadvice, \"When you meet with an insuperable difficulty, look it\r\nsteadfastly in the face--and pass on.\" For neither they nor any of their\r\nthousands of followers have ever, so far as I know, pointed out the\r\nhorrible logic in taking this immense complex of guesses and assumptions\r\nas the starting-point for new departures, the solid foundation for\r\ndetailed \"investigations\" as to =just how= this wonderful phenomenon of\r\ndevelopment has occurred. For after Agassiz and his contemporaries had\r\nbuilt on these large assumptions of Cuvier, and had arranged the details\r\nand the exact order of these successive forms by comparison with the\r\nembryonic life of the modern individual, the evolutionists of our time,\r\nled by such men as Spencer and Haeckel, with their \"philogenetic\r\nprinciple,\" =prove= their theory of evolution by showing that the\r\nembryonic life of the individual is only \"a brief recapitulation, as it\r\nwere from memory,\" of the geological succession in time. There would\r\nreally seem to be little hope of reaching with any arguments a\r\ngeneration of scientists who can elaborate genealogical trees of descent\r\nfor the different families and genera of the animal kingdom, based\r\nwholly on such a series of assumptions and blind guesses, and then palm\r\noff their work on a credulous world as the proved results of =inductive=\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I am tempted to make some effort in this direction. And since we\r\nhave now examined the _a priori_ aspects of the question, it remains to\r\ntest the two above mentioned assumptions by the facts of the rocks. The\r\n=second=, indeed, involving as it does a profound supernatural knowledge\r\nof the past, and being so positively contrary to all that we know of the\r\nmodern world as to seem essentially absurd, is yet by its very nature\r\nbeyond the reach of any tests that we can bring to bear upon it. Hence\r\nit remains to test by the facts of the rocks =the assumption that all\r\nover the earth the fossils invariably occur in the particular order in\r\nwhich they were first found in a few corners of Western Europe= by the\r\nfounders of the science. Have we already a sufficiently broad knowledge\r\nof the rocks of the world to decide such a question? I think we have.\r\n\r\nTo begin then at the beginning, let us try to find out how we can fix on\r\nthe rocks which are absolutely the oldest on the globe. We would expect\r\nto find a good many patches of them here and there, but there must be\r\nsome common characteristic by which they may be distinguished wherever\r\nfound. Of course, when I say \"rocks\" here I mean fossils, for as has\r\nlong been agreed upon by geologists, mineral and mechanical characters\r\nare of practically no use in determining the age of deposits, and we are\r\nhere dealing only with life and the order in which it has occurred on\r\nthe globe. Accordingly our problem is really to find that typical group\r\nof fossils which is essentially older than all dissimilar groups of\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nIn most localities we do not have to go very far down[14] into the earth\r\nto find granite or other so-called igneous rocks, which not only do not\r\ncontain any traces of fossils, but which we have no proper reason for\r\nsupposing ever contained any. These Azoic or Archaean rocks constitute\r\npractically all the earth's crust, there being only a thin skim of\r\nfossiliferous strata on the outside somewhat like the skin on an apple.\r\nNow it would be natural enough to suppose that those fossils which occur\r\nat the bottom, or next to the Archaean, are the oldest. This is\r\ndoubtless what the earlier geologists had in mind, or at least ought to\r\nhave had, for it is not quite certain that they had any clear thoughts\r\non the matter whatever. They did not really begin at the bottom, but\r\nhalf way up, so to speak, at the Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks, and\r\nSedgwick and Murchison, who undertook to find bottom, got too excited\r\nover their Cambro-Silurian controversy to attend to such an\r\ninsignificant detail as the logical proof that any type of fossils was\r\nreally older than all others. If they had really stopped to consider\r\nthat some type of fossil might occur next to the Archaean in Wales, and\r\nanother type occur thus in Scotland, while still another type altogether\r\nmight be found in this position in some other locality, and so on over\r\nthe world, leading us to the very natural conclusion that in the olden\r\ntimes as now =there were zoological provinces and districts=, the\r\nhistory of science during the nineteenth century might have been very\r\ndifferent, and this chapter might never have been written. But this\r\ncommonplace of modern geology, that any type of fossil whatever, even\r\nthe very \"youngest,\" may occur next to the Archaean, was not then\r\nconsidered or understood; and when about 1830 it came to be recognized,\r\nother things were allowed to obscure its significance, and the habit of\r\narranging the rocks in chronological order according to their fossils\r\nwas too firmly established to be disturbed by such an idea.\r\n\r\nBut the Fact Number One, which I have chosen as the subject of this\r\nchapter, is the now well established principle that =any kind of fossil\r\nwhatever, even \"young\" Tertiary rocks, may rest upon the Archaean or\r\nAzoic series, or may themselves be almost wholly metamorphosed or\r\ncrystalline, thus resembling in position and outward appearance the\r\nso-called \"oldest\" rocks=.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this proposition, about any rocks occurring next to\r\nthe Archaean, is covered by the following quotation from Dana:[15]\r\n\r\n\"A stratum of one era may rest upon any stratum in the whole of the\r\nseries below it,--the Coal-measures on either the Archaean, Silurian, or\r\nDevonian strata; and the Jurassic, Cretaceous, or Tertiary on any one of\r\nthe earlier rocks, the intermediate being wanting. The Quaternary in\r\nAmerica in some cases rests on Archaean rocks, in others on Silurian or\r\nDevonian, in others on Cretaceous or Tertiary.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to multiply testimony on a point so universally\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAs for the other half of this fact, that even the so-called \"youngest\"\r\nrocks may be metamorphic and crystalline just as well as the \"oldest,\"\r\nit also is now a recognized commonplace of science. Dana[16] says that\r\nas early as 1833 Lyell taught this as a general truth applicable to \"all\r\nthe formations from the earliest to the latest.\"\r\n\r\nThe first reference I can find to any disproof of this old fable of\r\nWerner's, that only certain kinds of rock are to be found next to the\r\n\"Primitive\" or Archaean, is in the observations of Studer and Beaumont\r\nin the Alps, (1826-28), who found \"relatively young\" fossils in\r\ncrystalline schists, which, as Zittel says, \"was a very great blow to\r\nthe geologists who upheld the hypothesis of the Archaean or pre-Cambrian\r\nage of all gneisses and schists.\"\r\n\r\nJames Geikie, doubtless referring to the same series of rocks, tells us\r\nthat:--\r\n\r\n\"In the central Alps of Switzerland, some of the Eocene strata are so\r\nhighly metamorphosed that they closely resemble some of the most ancient\r\ndeposits of the globe, consisting, as they do, of crystalline rocks,\r\nmarble, quartz-rock, mica schist, and gneiss.\"[17]\r\n\r\nHence we need not be surprised at the following statement of the\r\nsituation by Zittel.[18]\r\n\r\n\"The last fifteen years of the nineteenth century witnessed very great\r\nadvances in our knowledge of rock-deformation and metamorphism. =It has\r\nbeen found that there is no geological epoch whose sedimentary deposits\r\nhave been wholly safeguarded from metamorphic changes=, and, as this\r\nbroad fact has come to be realized, it has proved most unsettling, and\r\nhas necessitated a revision of the stratigraphy of many districts in the\r\nlight of new possibilities. The newer researches scarcely recognize any\r\ntheory; they are directed rather to the empirical method of obtaining\r\nall possible information regarding microscopic and field evidences of\r\nthe passage from metamorphic to igneous rocks, and from metamorphic to\r\nsedimentary rocks.\"\r\n\r\nBut in addition to what Zittel means by recognizing \"no theory\" as to\r\nthe origin of the various sorts of \"igneous\" rocks, it seems to me that\r\nthis \"broad fact\" ought surely to prove \"most unsettling,\" to the\r\ntraditional theories about certain fossils being intrinsically older\r\nthan others. With our minds divested of all prejudice, and this \"broad\"\r\nFact Number One well comprehended, that any kind of fossil whatever may\r\noccur next to the Archaean, and the rocky strata containing it may in\r\ntexture and appearance \"closely resemble some of the most ancient\r\ndeposits on the globe,\" =where= on this broad earth shall we look for\r\nthe place =to start= our life-succession That is, where can we now go to\r\nfind those kinds of fossils which we can prove, by independent\r\narguments, to be absolutely older than all others? It may seem very\r\ndifficult for some of us to discard a theory so long an integral part of\r\nall geology; but until it can be proved that this \"broad fact\" as stated\r\nby Zittel and Dana is no fact at all, I see no escape from the\r\nacknowledgment that the doctrine of any particular fossils being\r\nessentially older than others is a pure invention, with absolutely\r\nnothing in nature to support it.\r\n\r\nOr, to state the matter in another way, since the life succession theory\r\nrests logically and historically on Werner's notion that only certain\r\nkinds of rocks (fossils) are to be found at the \"bottom\" or next to the\r\nArchaean, and it is now acknowledged everywhere that any kind of rocks\r\nwhatever may be thus situated, it is as clear as sunlight that the life\r\nsuccession theory rests logically and historically on a myth, and that\r\nthere is =no way of proving what kind of fossil was buried first=.\r\n\r\nOf course, the reason the followers of Cuvier and his life succession\r\nnow find themselves in such a fix as this is because they have not been\r\nfollowing true inductive methods. Theirs has been a geology by\r\nhypothesis instead of by observed fact. They started out with a pretty\r\nscheme ready-made about the origin and formation of the world, perfectly\r\ninnocent of any evil intent in such a method of procedure, and\r\nunconscious of its speculative character; and for nearly a hundred years\r\nthey have supposed that they were following inductive methods in\r\nGeology. But in view of what we have now learned I think we are\r\nperfectly justified in adapting and applying to Cuvier and the modern\r\nschool of geologists what Geikie[19] says about Werner and his school:\r\n\r\n\"But never in the history of science did a stranger hallucination arise\r\nthan that of Cuvier and the modern school, when they supposed themselves\r\nto discard theory and build on a foundation of accurately ascertained\r\nfact. Never was a system devised in which theory was more rampant;\r\ntheory, too, unsupported by observation, and, as we now know, utterly\r\nerroneous. From beginning to end of Cuvier's method and its\r\napplications, assumptions were made for which there was no ground, and\r\nthese assumptions were treated as demonstrable facts. The very point to\r\nbe proved was taken for granted, and the evolutionary geologists who\r\nboasted of their avoidance of speculation, were in reality among the\r\nmost hopelessly speculative of all the generations that had tried to\r\nsolve the problem of the theory of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] The onion-coat hypothesis, which is the only other alternative,\r\n    modern science professes to have abandoned.\r\n\r\n[14] When the text-books speak of ten or twelve miles thickness of the\r\n    fossiliferous rocks, the reader should remember how the rocks have\r\n    to be patched up together from here and there to make this\r\n    incredible thickness, as only a small fraction of such a thickness\r\n    exists in any one place.\r\n\r\n[15] \"Manual,\" p. 399, Fourth Ed.\r\n\r\n[16] \"Manual,\" p. 408.\r\n\r\n[17] \"Manual of Historical Geol.,\" p. 74.\r\n\r\n[18] \"Hist.,\" p. 360.\r\n\r\n[19] \"Founders of Geology,\" p. 112.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFACT NUMBER TWO\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we had ample evidence that a certain man was personally acquainted\r\nwith Julius Caesar, that they were born in the same town, went to school\r\ntogether, served in the same wars, and later carried on an extensive\r\nmutual correspondence, would we not conclude that they must have lived\r\nin the same age of the world's history? I confess that the conclusion\r\nseems quite unavoidable. Who would dream that eighteen centuries or more\r\nhad separated the two lives, and that while one was an old Roman the\r\nother was an American of the latter nineteenth century?\r\n\r\nSome such a puzzle as this is presented in geology under the general\r\nsubject of =conformability=. Let me define this term.\r\n\r\nStrata laid down by water are in the first place in a horizontal\r\nposition. Some subsequent force may have disturbed them, so that we may\r\nnow find them standing up on edge like books in a library. But all human\r\nexperience goes to show that they were not deposited in this position.\r\nSome disturbing cause must have taken hold of them since they were laid\r\ndown, for the water in which they were made must have spread them out\r\nsmooth and horizontal, each subsequent layer or stratum fitting \"like a\r\nglove\" on the preceding. Thus when we find two successive layers\r\nagreeing with one another in their planes of bedding, with every\r\nindication that the lower one was not disturbed in any way before the\r\nupper one was spread out upon it, the two are said to be =conformable=.\r\nBut if the lower bed has evidently been upturned or disturbed before the\r\nother was laid down, or if its surface has even been partly eroded or\r\nwashed away by the water, the strata are said to be =unconformable=, or\r\nthey show =unconformability= in bedding.\r\n\r\nOf course, in all this we are dealing only with =relative= time. When we\r\nfind one bed or stratum lying above another in their natural position,\r\nthe lower one is of course the older of the two; but whether laid down\r\nten minutes earlier, or ten million years earlier, how are we to\r\ndetermine? Ignoring the matter of the fossils they contain, must we not\r\nown that, though there is no way of telling just how much longer the\r\nlower one was deposited before the next succeeding, yet if the two are\r\nconformable to one another, and the bottom one shows no evidence of\r\ndisturbance or erosion before the other was fitted upon it, the strong\r\npresumption would seem to be that no great length of time could have\r\nelapsed between the laying down of the two layers. To say that we have\r\nhere a geological example similar to that of a modern American having\r\nbeen personally acquainted with Julius Caesar, would seem to be quite\r\n\"inexplicable,\" as Herbert Spencer used to say.\r\n\r\nBut if the life succession theory be true, we have just such a conundrum\r\nin our Fact Number Two, which is that =any formation whatever may rest\r\nconformably upon any other \"older\" formation=.\r\n\r\nThe lower may be Devonian, Silurian, or Cambrian, and the upper one\r\nCretaceous or Tertiary, and thus according to the theory millions on\r\nmillions of years must have elapsed after the first, and before the\r\nfollowing bed was laid down, but the conformability is perfect, and the\r\nbeds have all the appearance of having followed in quick succession.\r\nSometimes, too, though less frequently, these age-separated formations\r\nare lithologically the same, and can only be separated by their fossils!\r\n\r\nBut before going into the minute description of any of these cases, we\r\nmust notice some general statements. Thus as long ago as the date of the\r\npublication of \"The Origin of Species,\" Darwin, in speaking of the\r\n\"Imperfection of the Geological Record,\" could speak of \"The many cases\r\non record of a formation conformably covered, after an immense interval\r\nof time, by another and later formation, without the underlying bed\r\nhaving suffered in the interval by any wear and tear.\"[20]\r\n\r\nAlso Geikie,[21] in speaking of how \"fossil evidence may be made to\r\nprove the existence of gaps which are not otherwise apparent,\" says that\r\n\"It is not so easy to give a satisfactory account of those which occur\r\nwhere the strata are strictly conformable, and where no evidence can be\r\nobserved of any considerable change of physical conditions at the time\r\nof deposit. A group of quite conformable strata having the same general\r\nlithological characters throughout, may be marked by a great discrepance\r\nbetween the fossils of the upper and the lower part.\" In many cases he\r\nsays these conditions are \"not merely local, but persistent over wide\r\nareas.... They occur abundantly among the European Palaeozoic and\r\nSecondary rocks,\" and are \"traceable over wide regions.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how Dana admits that \"A stratum of one era may rest upon\r\nany stratum in the whole series below it, ... the intermediate being\r\nwanting.\" He classes this under the head of the \"=Difficulties=\" of the\r\nscience, quite naturally as it would seem, though he does not expressly\r\nassert that these age-separated formations are often =conformable= to\r\none another, as Geikie and Darwin have said in the above given\r\nquotations.\r\n\r\nThe literature really teems with illustrations of these facts, and the\r\nmore detailed accounts contained in the various Geological Reports are\r\noften quite charmingly _naive_ in their description of the conditions.\r\nTwo examples, however, must suffice, both from the Canadian North West.\r\n\r\nThe first is from the Report on the region about Banff, in Alberta, near\r\nthe line of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and just east of the Rockies.\r\n\r\n\"East of the main divide the Lower Carboniferous is overlaid in places\r\nby beds of Lower Cretaceous age, and here again, although the two\r\nformations differ so widely in respect to age, one overlies the other\r\nwithout any perceptible break, and the separation of one from the other\r\nis rendered more difficult by the fact that the upper beds of the\r\nCarboniferous =are lithologically almost precisely like those of the\r\nCretaceous (above them.) Were it not for fossil evidence, one would\r\nnaturally suppose that a single formation was being dealt with.=\"[22]\r\n\r\nThe other example is from the District of Athabasca.\r\n\r\n\"The Devonian limestone is apparently succeeded conformably by the\r\nCretaceous, and with the possible exception of a thin bed of\r\nconglomerate of limited extent, which occurs below Crooked Rapid on the\r\nAthabasca, the age of which is doubtful, the =vast interval of time=\r\nwhich separated the two formations, is, so far as observed,\r\n=unrepresented= either by deposition or erosion.\"[23]\r\n\r\nOf course, some geological writers labor to explain this thundering\r\nrebuke of their theory, just as the Ptolemaic astronomers had their\r\n\"deterrents\" and \"epicycles\" for every new difficulty. But surely the\r\ndetailed records of such observations as these are fearful examples of\r\nthe power of tradition to blind the minds of investigators to the\r\nmeaning of the very plainest facts.\r\n\r\nOn a previous page (Id. p. 51,) the author last quoted gives us some\r\nidea of the \"remarkable persistence\" of this instructive case of\r\nconformability, which extends from the Athabasca \"in a broad band around\r\nthe southern end of Birch Mountains, and across Lake Claire to Peace\r\nRiver, and up the latter stream to a point two miles above Vermillion\r\nFalls.\"\r\n\r\nThe distance, as I judge from the map, can not be less than 150 miles in\r\na straight direction, thus making a district of probably several\r\nthousand square miles in extent where, according to the theory of a life\r\nsuccession, nature must have put an injunction on the action of the\r\nelements, and they had to continue in the _status quo_ for millions of\r\nages, or from the Devonian to the Cretaceous \"age,\" the water neither\r\nwearing away nor building up over any part of this consecrated ground\r\nduring all this time.\r\n\r\nNor is this all, for from Part E, Report (p. 209) of this same volume,\r\nwe are told of strata near Lake Manitoba, =over 500 miles away=, in\r\nalmost the same wonderful relationship,--\"Devonian rocks very similar in\r\ncharacter\" to those in Athabasca still overlaid directly by the\r\nCretaceous, though in this case as it happens \"unconformably.\" It would\r\nalmost seem to be a _bona fide_ case of Werner's onion coats cropping\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAnd all this incredible picture of nature's inconsistent behaviour in\r\npast ages is necessitated solely by the loving allegiance with which the\r\ninfallibility of the life succession theory is regarded by modern\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] \"Origin,\" Vol. II., p. 58: Sixth Ed.

Not very many. And yet\r\nevents even more wonderful than this have frequently occurred in the\r\npast, as we are confidently assured by the leaders in geological\r\nscience. Thus, in speaking of a certain region in the Alps, Dana[24]\r\nsays that \"one of the overthrust folds has put the beds upside down over\r\nan area of 450 square miles.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well worth our while to try to understand this statement. Our\r\nfirst and most natural inquiry is, What is it that leads scientists to\r\nthink so? The details of this particular case are not very accessible,\r\nand so we are driven to reasoning from analogy from the known methods\r\nand constructions employed in this science. We must agree that none of\r\nthe authorities who report this circumstance can testify as\r\neye-witnesses of this marvellous event: they were not there on the spot\r\nwhen old Mother Earth turned this huge calcareous and silicious pancake.\r\nAnd yet there must be some kind of evidence by which these eminent men\r\nhave arrived at this conclusion. What kind of evidence can it be?\r\n\r\nWe cannot imagine any physical evidence which could even remotely\r\nsuggest such an idea. In fact from the universal custom of making the\r\ncontained fossils the supreme test of the age of a rock deposit, we are\r\nperfectly safe in concluding that it is =solely because the fossils\r\noccur here in the reverse of the accepted order=, that we have this\r\nastounding picture of an immense mountain mass having been put \"upside\r\ndown over an area of 450 square miles.\" The \"older\" fossils are\r\nevidently here on top, while the \"younger\" ones are underneath, and of\r\ncourse some explanation must be given of this flat contradiction of the\r\nlife succession theory.\r\n\r\nBut let us retrace our steps somewhat, and pick up the thread of our\r\nargument. We have already found quite serious reason to question the\r\naccuracy of this life succession theory: but there is still another way\r\nof testing its rationality. If certain fossils are not necessarily older\r\nthan certain others, it might reasonably be expected that we would now\r\nand then find them reversed as to position, i.e., with the \"younger\"\r\nbelow and the \"older\" above. Accordingly we have the following very\r\nnecessary caution from Prof. Nicholson:[25]\r\n\r\n\"It may even be said that in any case where there should appear to be a\r\nclear and decisive discordance between the physical and the\r\npalaeontological (fossil) evidence as to the age of a given series of\r\nbeds, it is the former that is to be distrusted rather than the latter.\"\r\n\r\nTo meet all ordinary cases of this character, where the differences\r\ninvolve only a few formations representing a few \"ages\" or a few million\r\nyears, the theory of pioneer \"colonies\" was invented by Barrande in\r\n1852.\r\n\r\nBut for extreme cases, say where Silurian or Cambrian fossils occur\r\n=above= Jurassic, Cretaceous or Tertiary, there is in such a predicament\r\nalways an anxious search made for faults and displacements; or gigantic\r\n\"thrust-faults\" or \"overthrust folds,\" like the example already quoted\r\nfrom Dana, are described in picturesque language, many miles in\r\nextent--inventions which, as I have already suggested of a similar\r\nexpedient to explain away evidence, deserve to rank with the famous\r\n\"epicycles\" of Ptolemy, and will do so some day.\r\n\r\nHere is Geikie's highly instructive statement regarding the same\r\nconditions:--\r\n\r\n\"We may even demonstrate that in some mountainous ground, the strata\r\nhave been turned completely upside down, _if_ we can show that the\r\nfossils in what are now the uppermost layers =ought properly= to lie\r\nunderneath those in the beds below them.\"[26]\r\n\r\nSome day, I fancy, a statement like this will be regarded as a literary\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of examples under this head, though two or three ought\r\nto be as good as a dozen. In the part of Alberta east of the Rockies\r\nalready referred to, is a section of country of about fourteen square\r\nmiles at least--and we know not how much more--where Cambrian fossils\r\nare found =above= Cretaceous, and the inevitable \"thrust fault\" is thus\r\ndescribed by one of the officers of the Canadian Geological Survey. He\r\nhas just been speaking of \"a series\" of these \"gigantic thrust\r\nfaults\":--\r\n\r\n\"One of the largest and most important of these occurs along the eastern\r\nbase of the chain, and brings the Cambrian limestones of the Castle\r\nMountain group over the Cretaceous of the foot hills. This fault has a\r\nvertical displacement of more than 15,000 feet (? three miles), and an\r\nestimated horizontal displacement of the Cambrian beds of about seven\r\nmiles in an easterly section. The actually observed overlap amounts to\r\nnearly two miles. The angle of inclination of its plane to the horizon\r\nis =very low=, and in consequence of this its outcrop follows a very\r\nsinuous line along the base of the mountains, =and acts exactly like the\r\nline of contact of two nearly horizontal formations=.\r\n\r\n\"The best places for examining this fault are at the gaps of the Bow and\r\nof the south fork of the Ghost River. At the former place the Cretaceous\r\nshales form the floor of the bay which the Bow has cut in the eastern\r\nwall of the range, and rise to a considerable height in the surrounding\r\nslopes. Their line of contact with the massive gray limestones of the\r\noverlying Castle Mountain group is well seen near the entrance of the\r\ngap in the hills to the north. The fault plane here is nearly\r\nhorizontal, and the two formations, viewed from the valley, =appear to\r\nsucceed one another conformably=.\"[27]\r\n\r\nBut what an amazing condition of affairs is this. Here are great\r\nmountainous masses of rock, very similar in mechanical and mineral\r\nmake-up to thousands of examples elsewhere. The line of bedding between\r\nthem \"acts exactly like the line of contact of two nearly horizontal\r\nformations,\" and in a natural section cut out by a river the two \"appear\r\nto succeed one another conformably.\" And yet we are asked to believe\r\nthat all this is merely an optical illusion. The rocks could not\r\npossibly have been deposited in this way, for the lower ones contain\r\n\"Benton fossils\" (Cretaceous), and the upper ones are Cambrian, and\r\nalmost the whole geological series and untold millions of years occurred\r\n=after= the upper one, and =before= the lower one was formed. Solely on\r\nthe strength of the infallibility of a theory invented a hundred years\r\nago in a little corner of Western Europe, which \"promulgated, as\r\nrespecting the world, a scheme collected from that province,\" and\r\nassumed that over all the world the rocks must always follow the order\r\nthere observed, we are here asked to deny the positive evidence of our\r\nsenses =because= these rocks do not follow this accepted order. I must\r\nconfess that I cannot see the force of such a method of reasoning. It is\r\ncarrying the argument several degrees beyond the reasoning of the three\r\nlittle green peas in the little green pod, as narrated in the exquisite\r\nfable of Eugene Field. These wise little fellows noticed that their\r\nlittle world was all green, and they themselves green likewise, and they\r\nshrewdly concluded from this that the whole universe must also be green.\r\nBut we are not told of their travelling abroad and persisting in a\r\nsystematic attempt to explain all subsequently observed facts in terms\r\nof their theory.\r\n\r\nThis government Report last quoted from says that in the eastern part of\r\nTennessee the Appalachian Chain \"presents an almost identical\r\nstructure,\" and refers to a similar state of things in the Highlands of\r\nScotland. Dana, in the last edition of his \"Manual\" (p. 369), refers to\r\nthis report, and reproduces some of its plates showing some of the\r\nstructures referred to; and on another page, in speaking of this similar\r\nexample in Scotland, says that \"a mass of the oldest crystalline rocks,\r\nmany miles in length from north to south, was thrust at least ten miles\r\nwestward over younger rocks, part of the latter fossiliferous\"; and\r\nfurther declares that \"the thrust planes look like planes of bedding,\r\nand were long so considered.\"[28]\r\n\r\nGeikie quite naturally devotes several pages in his \"Text-Book\" to a\r\ndescription of these conditions in the Highlands; but from one of his\r\nfirst reports on these observations, published in _Nature_[29] we get\r\nsome much more suggestive details. The thrust-planes, he says, are\r\ndifficult to be \"distinguished from ordinary stratification planes, like\r\nwhich they have been plicated, faulted, and denuded. Here and there, as\r\na result of denudation, a portion of one of them =appears capping a\r\nhill-top=. One almost refuses to believe that the little outlier on the\r\nsummit does not lie normally on the rocks below it, but on a nearly\r\nhorizontal fault by which it has been moved into its place.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of some similar conditions in Ross Shire, which he himself had\r\npreviously described as naturally conformable, he declares:--\r\n\r\n\"=Had these sections been planned for the purpose of deception= they\r\ncould not have been more skillfully devised ... and no one coming first\r\nto this ground would suspect that what appears to be a normal\r\nstratigraphical sequence is not really so.\"\r\n\r\n\"When a geologist finds\" things in this condition, he says, \"he may be\r\nexcused if he begins to wonder =whether he himself is not really\r\nstanding on his head=.\"\r\n\r\nBut I would only weary the reader by attempting to pursue this subject\r\nfurther. Those who wish to do so will find many additional examples in\r\nthe larger works of Dana, LeConte, Prestwich, and Geikie, to say nothing\r\nof the more detailed statements buried in numerous Government Reports\r\nand special monographs in German and French.\r\n\r\nFrom the very same set of beds different observers try to explain these\r\npuzzles in very different ways. Some, like Helm, will describe gigantic\r\noverthrust folds, and will draw immense arcs of circles several miles\r\nhigh in the air, as the place where the rocks must once have been.\r\nOthers, like Rothpletz, from an examination of the very same rocks, will\r\ncut the mountain up into sections with imaginary fault-planes, and will\r\ntell how, in the district about Glarus for example, an enormous mass of\r\nmountains \"travelled from east to west a distance of about twenty-five\r\nmiles from the Rhine valley to the Linth,\" or how the \"Rhatikon Mountain\r\nmass travelled from Montafon valley to the Rhine valley, about nineteen\r\nmiles from east to west.\"[30]\r\n\r\nWith regard to some at least of these conditions in the Alps, Geikie\r\nvirtually admits that these incredible and self-contradictory\r\nearth-movements are necessitated by and described from fossil evidence\r\nonly, for he says:--\r\n\r\n\"... the strata could scarcely be supposed to have been really inverted,\r\nsave for the evidence (_sic_) as to their true order of succession\r\nsupplied by their included fossils.\" \"... portions of Carboniferous\r\nstrata appear as if regularly interbedded among Jurassic rocks, and\r\nindeed could not be separated save after a study of their enclosed\r\norganic remains.\"[31]\r\n\r\nIn fact, we are perfectly safe in concluding in all similar cases that\r\nwe may encounter in the literature of the science that it is the\r\nreversed order of the fossils which constitutes the whole evidence; for,\r\nas I have said, we can imagine no possible physical evidence competent\r\nto form a foundation for such ideas, nor do I know of anything save the\r\nexigencies of this venerable theory of life succession, for which\r\notherwise competent observers will thus freely sacrifice their common\r\nsense. When the dividing line between two sets of strata \"acts exactly\r\nlike the line of contact between two nearly horizontal formations,\" so\r\nmuch so that in a natural section cut out by a river the two \"appear to\r\nsucceed one another conformably,\" a calm judicial mind, divested of all\r\ntheoretical prejudice, instead of talking about these conditions having\r\nbeen planned by nature \"for the purpose of deception,\" will find no\r\ndifficulty at all in believing that these rocks were really laid down in\r\nthe =reverse order= in which we now find them, with the \"younger\" below\r\nand the \"older\" above, and only one under the hypnotic spell of a\r\npreconceived theory would at the suggestion of such a fact begin \"to\r\nwonder whether he himself is not really standing on his head.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] \"Manual,\" p. 367.\r\n\r\n[25] \"Ancient Life-History of the Earth,\" p. 40.\r\n\r\n[26] \"Text-Book,\" p. 837, Ed. of 1903.\r\n\r\n[27] \"Annual Report,\" New Series, Vol. II., Part D, pp. 33-34.\r\n\r\n[28] pp. 111, 534.\r\n\r\n[29] Nov. 13, 1884, pp. 29-35.\r\n\r\n[30] See _Nature_, Jan. 24, 1901, p. 294.\r\n\r\n[31] \"Text-Book,\" p. 678.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFACT NUMBER FOUR\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is only one class of agents now working upon the rocks of the\r\nglobe which have been in business continuously ever since the dry land\r\nappeared, and which have left us a legible record of approximately the\r\namount of business they have been doing all these centuries. And my Fact\r\nNumber Four, which will complete this line of argument in illustrating\r\nthe antagonism between the facts of the rocks and the theory of life\r\nsuccession, is that the =rivers= of the world, which of course are the\r\nagents to which I have referred, in traveling across the country, =act\r\nprecisely as if they knew nothing of the varying ages of the rocks=, but\r\non the contrary treat them all alike as if they were of the same age,\r\nand =as if they began sawing at them all at the same time=. Of course it\r\nis, evidently, in only a few cases where the records are so free from\r\nambiguity as to be quite incapable of being misunderstood, that is, the\r\ncases of rivers with steep rocky gorges, or those that cut through\r\nmountain ranges; but there are several such rivers in the world, and\r\nthey all seem to tell the same story.\r\n\r\nThe famous Colorado River is a good example. It flows from \"younger\"\r\nstrata into \"older\" in its deep cutting across the Arizona plateau.[32]\r\nStated in terms of the current theory, this means that when the region\r\nof country about the lower part of this river's course first became dry\r\nland, the upper part was still sea, and that thus there was no such\r\nriver in existence here until the very \"youngest\" of these rocks was\r\nformed. For otherwise the river must have started running from the sea\r\ntoward the dry land, i.e., running up hill. Stated in terms neutral as\r\nto theory, it means that the whole of this region of country, drained by\r\nthis large river, with its rocks of many varying \"ages,\" was all\r\nelevated practically as it is now before this river began its work of\r\nerosion. It treats all these rocks as if they were of the same age, and\r\nas if it began sawing at them all at the same time.\r\n\r\nAlso its companion, the Green River, cuts through the Uinta Range in the\r\nsame manner. Similar conditions are said to occur on the Danube, and in\r\nthe river-courses of the Himalayas, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Colorado, Zittel says that:\r\n\r\n\"Powell's explanation of the apparent enigma is that after the river had\r\neroded its channel rocks were uplifted in one portion of its course, but\r\nso slow was the rate of uplift that the river was enabled to deepen its\r\nchannel, either proportionately or more rapidly, so that it was never\r\ndiverted from its former course.\"\r\n\r\nIt was by similarly cunning inventions that the early writers on\r\nastronomy, alchemy, and medicine evaded the force of accumulated facts\r\nwhich told against their absurd theories.\r\n\r\nWe have now completed our survey of the strictly stratigraphical phases\r\nof this question, and have found four very remarkable principles about\r\nthe rocks, which I wish to summarize here before proceeding further.\r\n\r\n(1) The \"broad fact,\" as stated by Zittel and Dana, that any kind of\r\nrocks whatever, i.e. containing any kinds of fossils, even the\r\n\"youngest,\" may rest on the Archaean, and may thus in position, as also\r\nin texture and appearance, resemble the very oldest deposits on the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n(2) That any kind of beds may rest in such perfect conformability on any\r\nother so-called \"older\" beds over vast stretches of country that, \"were\r\nit not for fossil evidence, one would naturally suppose that a single\r\nformation was being dealt with,\" while \"the vast interval of time\r\nintervening is unrepresented either by deposition or erosion.\" The\r\nyoungest seem to have followed the oldest in quick succession.\r\n\r\n(3) That in very many cases and over many square miles of country these\r\nconditions are exactly reversed, and such very \"ancient\" rocks as\r\nCambrian limestones are on top of the comparatively \"young\" Cretaceous,\r\nwhile the lime between them \"acts exactly like the line of contact of\r\ntwo nearly horizontal formations,\" and in a natural section made by a\r\nriver the two \"appear to succeed one another conformably.\" To any one\r\nignorant of the theory of life succession they have every appearance of\r\nhaving been deposited as we find them.\r\n\r\n(4) That the rivers of the world, in cutting across the country,\r\ncompletely ignore the varying ages of the rocks in the different parts\r\nof their courses, and act precisely as if they began sawing at them all\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nNow I know not what additional fact can be demanded or imagined to\r\ncomplete the demonstration that there is =no particular order= in which\r\nthe fossils can be said to occur as regards succession in time. It is\r\ntrue, some fossiliferous deposits, metamorphosed almost beyond\r\nrecognition, and buried deep beneath thousands of feet of subsequent\r\ndeposits, have enough appearance of remote antiquity about them in all\r\nconscience. But to increase this antiquity by saying that other equally\r\nprodigious masses of rocks elsewhere were deposited long after these, or\r\nby pointing to still other deposits in another region which are said to\r\nbe older than any of the others, is an illogical and wholly unscientific\r\nprocedure. I fear I could scarcely confine myself within the bounds of\r\nparliamentary language were I to attempt to express an opinion regarding\r\nany effort that may now be made to justify the life succession theory in\r\nview of the above acknowledged facts.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it is scarcely necessary in this enlightened age to point out\r\nhow completely this vitiates any biological argument (such as that of\r\nDarwinism) which has incorporated into its system the results of such\r\nillogical reasoning, or which in any way is dependent upon the\r\nconclusions of such a theory of geology. In view of the laws of\r\nevidence, which every intelligent person is supposed to understand\r\nnow-a-days, surely some strange things passed for scientific proof\r\nduring the nineteenth century. For, as we have seen, the earlier\r\ngeologists did little better than =assume= the succession of life\r\nbodily; than Agassiz and his contemporaries =arranged the details= and\r\nthe exact order of these successive life forms by comparison with the\r\nembryonic life of the modern individual; and now the evolutionists of\r\nour day, led by such men as Spencer and Haeckel with their \"phylogenetic\r\nprinciple,\" =prove their theory of evolution= by showing that the\r\nembryonic life of the modern individual is only \"a brief\r\nrecapitulation, as it were, from memory,\" of the (assumed) geological\r\nsuccession in time. Surely this will some day make a more amazing record\r\nfor posterity than those of phlogiston or the epicycles of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nIf I am now asked: What do the rocks have to tell us, in view of the\r\nfact that they refuse to testify to a life succession? I can only say\r\nthat we are not as yet in a position to decide this question. There are\r\nseveral other matters connected with the character and mode of\r\noccurrence of the fossils, which are almost equally important with\r\nanything already considered, in forming a true scientific induction\r\nregarding this matter. These facts must be considered in subsequent\r\nchapters. Already, however, we can say this much, that we have in the\r\nrocks almost as complete a world, in some respects vastly more complete,\r\nthan the living world of to-day. With the life succession theory\r\nrepudiated, we have still to deal with the fossils themselves which have\r\nbeen thus systematically classified; =but this geological series becomes\r\nonly the taxonomic or classification series of an older state of our\r\npresent world=, buried somehow and at some time or times in the remote\r\npast--the how and the when of which we have not as yet the means to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nBut I think we are now prepared to enter the mazes of the biological\r\nargument, and to study the subject of extinct species, which by many is\r\nsupposed to furnish a line of independent evidence in favor of the life\r\nsuccession theory.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[32] See Zittel, \"History of Geol.,\" pp. 210, 211.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nEXTINCT SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us now test the value of this assumed life succession by another\r\nvery simple question. In \"Eocene times,\" so we are told, England was a\r\nland of palms, with a semi-tropical flora and fauna. In fact at this\r\ntime, cycads, gourds, proteads (like the Australian shrubs and trees),\r\nthe fig, cinnamon, screw-pine, and various species of acacias and palms,\r\nabounded in England and Western Europe; while turtles, monkeys,\r\ncrocodiles, and other sub-tropical and warm-temperate forms were equally\r\nabundant. Then again, in the Pleistocene deposits of the same countries,\r\nwe find various species of elephant and rhinoceros, with a hippopotamus,\r\nlion, and hyena, identical with species now living in the tropics,\r\n\"although,\" as Dana says, \"these modern kinds are dwarfs in comparison.\"\r\n\r\n=Now, how are we to prove that these various forms of animal life did\r\nnot exist together in these countries at the same time as the trees and\r\nplants before mentioned?=\r\n\r\nLions and monkeys, hippopotami and crocodiles, with elephants, hyenas,\r\nand rhinoceroses, now live beneath the palms, mimosas, acacias, and\r\nother tropical plants represented in the Eocene and Miocene beds. What\r\nis there to hinder us from believing that they all lived there together\r\nin that olden time? Surely it would be the very irony of scientific fate\r\nif forms now so closely connected in life should in death be so divided.\r\nOr, to present it in another form, why should we be asked to believe\r\nthat these acacias, cinnamons, palms, etc., lived and died ages or\r\nmillions of years before the lions, elephants, rhinoceroses and\r\nhippopotami, came into existence to enjoy their shade; and then, after\r\nthese unnumbered ages had dragged their slow length along and vanished\r\ninto the dim past, and all these semi-tropical plants had shifted to the\r\ntropics or been turned into lignite, these lions, elephants, and\r\nhippopotami came into existence in these same localities, when no such\r\nplants existed anywhere in Europe?\r\n\r\nSurely we ought to expect some pretty substantial evidence for such a\r\nviolation of \"the observed uniformity of nature.\" We generally boast\r\nthat we have outgrown the crude ideas of the earlier years of the\r\nscience when they spoke of \"ages\" of limestone making or of sandstone\r\nmaking; but it seems that some of us have not yet attained to that broad\r\nview of the essential =unity of nature= in which the flora and fauna of\r\nour world are seen to be just as indissolubly connected with each other.\r\nBut nature could as easily be persuaded to produce for a whole age\r\nnothing in the way of rock but limestone or conglomerate, as to adjust\r\nher powers to such an unbalanced state of affairs as is spoken of above,\r\nwith the animals in one age and the complementary plants in another.\r\n\r\nBut in considering this question as to why the Eocene plants and the\r\nPleistocene animals may not be supposed to have lived contemporaneously\r\ntogether, we are brought face to face with the =second= supposed\r\nargument in favor of there having been a succession of life on the\r\nglobe. The answer given is that all the animals of these \"early\"\r\nTertiary beds are extinct species, also very many of the plants; while\r\nthe hyena, lion, hippopotamus, etc., of the Pleistocene are identical\r\nwith the living species, and even the mammoth is so closely like its\r\nnearest surviving relative, the Asiatic elephant (_E. indicus_), that\r\nthese also might be classed as identical.[33]\r\n\r\nThis point being considered by many as so important, and having such a\r\nvital connection with the whole life succession theory, we must go into\r\nthe matter somewhat in detail, even at the risk of appearing rather\r\ntechnical to some.\r\n\r\nIf the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata are often of enormous extent,\r\nspreading in vast sheets over wide regions, so that their\r\nstratigraphical order in any particular district is quite readily made\r\nout, it is in =most cases= altogether different with the Tertiary and\r\nPleistocene deposits. For these resemble one another so much in\r\neverything except their fossils, and occur so generally in detached and\r\nfragmentary beds, holding no stratigraphical relation to one another,\r\nthat Lyell devised the plan of distinguishing them from one another and\r\narranging them in the accustomed order of successive ages, by their\r\nrelative percentages of living and extinct mollusca. With only\r\nunimportant changes, Lyell's divisions are still followed in classifying\r\noff the Tertiary and post-Tertiary beds. Those with all the species\r\nextinct, or less than 5 per cent. living, are classed as Eocene; those\r\ncontaining =few= extinct forms, or nearly all living species, are\r\nclassed as Pleistocene or post-Tertiary. The Miocene and Pliocene\r\nrepresent the intermediate grades, and all are supposed to be a true\r\nchronological order. It goes without saying that in actual practice it\r\nis often so extremely difficult to adjust these differences that beds\r\nare assigned to an \"early\" or a \"late\" division on =general principles=\r\nby what the literary critics would call \"tact\" or \"intuition,\" rather\r\nthan by the strict percentage system, though for these large and\r\nimportant divisions of Tertiary and post-Tertiary rocks, these are\r\nabsolutely the only professed grounds on which the subdivisions are\r\ndistinguished and arranged in the customary order of time.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Dr. David Page:\r\n\r\n\"As there is often no perceptible mineral distinction between many\r\nclays, sands and gravels, it is only by their imbedded fossils that\r\ngeologists can determine their Tertiary or post-Tertiary character.\"[34]\r\n\r\nNow to say that a set of beds, ninety-five per cent. of whose fossils\r\nbelong to extinct species, and only five per cent. are now living, must\r\nbe vastly older than another set where these percentages are reversed,\r\ni.e. where the species are nearly all living, seems at first thought an\r\neminently reasonable idea, and we immediately begin to imagine the long\r\nages it must have taken for these exceedingly numerous and apparently\r\nvigorous species to wear out and become extinct in the alleged ordinary\r\nway by the merciless struggle for existence with forms more fitted to\r\nsurvive.\r\n\r\nBut it is hardly necessary to point out that all this is based on the\r\nassumption of =Uniformity= in its most extreme type, a doctrine which\r\nnot only denies that these living forms are merely the =lucky survivors=\r\nof tremendous changes in which their contemporaries perished, but which\r\nin essence is taking for granted beforehand the very point which ought\r\nto be the chief aim of all geological inquiry, viz., How did the\r\ngeological changes take place? It would not be considered a very\r\nscientific procedure for a coroner, called upon to hold a _post mortem_,\r\nto content himself with interesting statistics about the percentage of\r\npeople who die of old age, fever, and other causes, while there was\r\nclear and decisive evidence that the poor fellow had been =shot=. In\r\nthis case, as in geology, it is not merely the result that is wrong, but\r\nthe whole method of investigation. For, as in the latter case we don't\r\nwant to know how people generally die, but how this particular person\r\nactually did die, so, in our study of geology, we do not wish to know\r\nmerely the rate at which changes of surface and extinctions of species\r\nare now going on, and then project this measure backward into the past\r\nas an infallible guide, but we wish to know for sure just what changes\r\nof this nature have taken place. A true induction is, I think, capable\r\nof deciding very positively whether or not the tools of nature have\r\nalways worked at the same rate and with the same force as at present;\r\nand this method of arranging the fossils in supposed chronological order\r\non the percentage basis mentioned above, is only an extreme form of\r\nmethods claiming to be inductive which in this age of the world ought to\r\nbe considered a shame and a disgrace, because, as Howorth says, they are\r\nbased, \"not upon induction, but upon hypotheses,\" and have \"all the\r\ninfirmity of the science of the Middle Ages.\"\r\n\r\nThen again, it occurs to us, that this method, of attaching a time-value\r\nto percentages of extinct or living species, would make the sub-fossil\r\nremains of the bison on the Western prairies almost infinitely =older=\r\nthan those of the lion, hippopotamus, etc., in the Pleistocene beds of\r\nEurope; for (except for some few specimens artificially preserved, and\r\nwhich may be ignored in this connection) the bison is to-day absolutely\r\nextinct, while the Pleistocene mammals are found by the thousand in the\r\nproper localities and show no signs of surrender in the struggle for\r\nexistence. Similar comparisons might be made between the great wingless\r\nbirds of Madagascar, Mauritius and New Zealand, and the many cases of\r\n\"persistent\" forms which have survived unchanged from Carboniferous,\r\nSilurian, or Cambrian times, a period of time which, in the language of\r\nthe current geology, means quite a large fraction of eternity. But all\r\nof these considerations show that the mere fact of certain species being\r\nextinct and others being now alive, is no trustworthy guide in\r\ndetermining the relative age of their remains, until we first find out\r\n=how they happened to become extinct=.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry as to the =how= and the =when= (relatively) is an absolutely\r\nessential preliminary in any such investigation; and is inseparably\r\nunited in nature with the general question of how the great geological\r\nchanges have taken place in the past. Of course, if everything like a\r\nworld-catastrophe is =a priori= denied; if, in other words, it is\r\nsettled from the first that all these fossils living and extinct did not\r\nlive contemporaneously with each other, the living ones being simply the\r\nlucky survivors of stupendous changes in which the others perished, then\r\nall pretense of a scientific investigation of the subject is at an end.\r\nIf a coroner has it settled beforehand that an accident or a murder\r\ncould not possibly have occurred, then his profession of a candid _post\r\nmortem_ examination is only a farce; for he does not hold it to find out\r\nanything, since he knows everything essential about it beforehand.\r\nUniformitarians would certainly make poor coroners, or for that matter\r\npoor investigators of law or history, or anything else.\r\n\r\nWill some one please give us a reasonable explanation of why the lion,\r\nhippopotamus, rhinoceros, and elephant shifted from England to the\r\ntropics? Or will they explain how, at this same general time, some\r\nelephants and rhinoceroses got caught in the merciless frosts of\r\nNorthern Siberia so suddenly that their flesh has remained untainted all\r\nthese centuries, and is now, wherever exposed, greedily devoured by the\r\ndogs and wolves?\r\n\r\nAn abundant warm-climate vegetation once mantled all the polar regions,\r\nand its fossils have been found just about as far north as explorers\r\nhave ever gone; while Dana says that, \"The encasing in ice of huge\r\nelephants, and the perfect preservation of the flesh, shows that the\r\ncold finally became =suddenly= extreme, as of a single winter's night,\r\nand knew no relenting afterwards.\"[35]\r\n\r\nNow, if no one can deny this =sudden= change of climate over half the\r\nworld or so at least, is it not extremely unscientific to deny that this\r\nsame cause, whatever it may have been, was quite competent to bring\r\nabout a good many other changes, and the extinction of numerous other\r\nspecies which we are so often reminded must imply the lapse of untold\r\nages of time? The economizing of energy, or the famous law of parsimony\r\nas stated by Leibnitz, is quite appropriate in this case, and may be\r\nreferred to again in the sequel. The principle upon which I must here\r\ninsist is that the mere fact of certain species being extinct, and\r\nothers being now alive, gives no clue whatever to the relative age of\r\nthese remains, until we first ascertain =why=, =how= and =when= this\r\nextinction was brought about. And yet, though every one admits the fact\r\nof tremendous changes of climate, etc., having intervened between that\r\nancient world and our own (the true extent and character of which, as I\r\nhave said, ought to be the chief point of all geological investigation),\r\nno allowance seems ever to be made for this as a powerful cause of\r\nextermination of all forms of life. But in the utter absence of any such\r\nexplanation as to =how= and =when=, and in the very teeth of these facts\r\nassuming a dead-level uniformitarianism, the presence of ten, fifty or a\r\nhundred per cent. of extinct forms in a set of beds is manifestly of no\r\nscientific value in determining age. It would be many degrees more\r\nreasonable and accurate to arrange all the Greek and Latin books of the\r\nworld in chronological order according to the percentage of their\r\n=words= which have survived into the English language. Indeed, it would\r\nbe much like a coroner, at the inquest following a railway disaster,\r\nattempting to arrange the exact order in which the various victims had\r\nperished by the proportionate number of surviving relatives which each\r\nhad left behind him.\r\n\r\nAnd the completely worthless character of such \"evidence\" of age\r\nbecomes, if possible, more apparent when we consider that very many of\r\nthese so-called \"extinct\" forms are not really distinct species from\r\ntheir living representatives of to-day. \"It is notorious,\" says Darwin,\r\n\"on what excessively slight differences many palaeontologists have\r\nfounded their species.\" And even to-day, in spite of all that we have\r\nlearned about variation, little or no allowance seems ever to be made\r\nfor the effects of a certainly greatly changed environment. If the\r\nfossil forms among the mollusks and other shell fish for instance, are\r\nnot precisely like the modern ones in every respect, they are always\r\nclassed as separate species, the older forms thus being \"extinct,\" in\r\nutter disregard of the striking anatomical differences between the huge\r\nPleistocene mammals and their dwarfish descendants of to-day, which for\r\na hundred years or so were declared positively to be distinct from one\r\nanother, but are now acknowledged to be identical.\r\n\r\nOf course no one denies that there are numerous extinct forms among the\r\ninvertebrates, just as we know there are among the huge vertebrates of\r\nthe Mesozoic and Tertiaries, none of which we moderns have ever seen\r\nalive. Other forms do not appear familiar to our modern eyes, because\r\nlarger or of somewhat different form; but to say that they are really\r\ndistinct species from their modern representatives, or to say that no\r\nhuman being ever saw them alive, are statements utterly incapable of\r\nproof. Up to about the year 1869 it was stoutly maintained that man had\r\nnever seen =any= of these fossil forms in life. But no one now maintains\r\nthis view, for human remains have now been found along with undisturbed\r\nfossils of the Pleistocene, or even middle Tertiaries, while the\r\npaintings on the cave walls of Southern France seem conclusive that they\r\nwere copied from life when the mammoth and reindeer lived side by side\r\nwith man in that latitude. Hence the only question now is, and it is the\r\nsupreme question of all modern geology, =WITH HOW MUCH OF THAT ANCIENT\r\nFOSSIL WORLD WERE THESE EQUALLY FOSSIL MEN ACQUAINTED?= If Man lived in\r\n\"Pliocene\" or perhaps \"Miocene times,\" when a luxuriant vegetation was\r\nspread out over all the Arctic regions, what possible evidence is there\r\nto show that his companions, the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, mammoth,\r\netc., were not also living then and browsing off just such plants, when\r\nthe Arctic frosts caught them in the grip of death and put their\r\n\"mummies\" in cold storage for our astonishment and scientific\r\ninformation? Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each\r\nother; why should not the plants and animals, contemporary with the same\r\ncreature (man), be just as truly contemporary with one another? If man\r\nwas contemporary with the Miocene plants, and the Pleistocene mammals\r\nwere contemporary with man, what is there to forbid the idea that the\r\nPleistocene mammals and the middle Tertiary flora were contemporary with\r\neach other?\r\n\r\nFor nearly half a century geologists have never had the courage to face\r\nthis problem fairly and squarely, with all preconceived prejudices about\r\nuniformity cast aside. Is it possible that all the plants and animals of\r\nthe Tertiaries and the Pleistocene may have really lived together in the\r\nsame world after all? But the trouble would then be that, with this much\r\nconceded, the whole \"phylogenic series\" would tumble with it, and become\r\nonly the taxonomic or classification series of that ancient world with\r\nwhich these fossil men were acquainted. To appropriate the words of one\r\nwho has done much to clear the ground for a common-sense study of\r\ngeology, I know of nothing against such an idea save \"the almost\r\npathetic devotion of a large school of thinkers to the religion founded\r\nby Hutton, whose high priest was Lyell, and which in essence is based on\r\n_a priori_ arguments like those which dominated Mediaeval scholasticism\r\nand made it so barren.\"[36]\r\n\r\nBaron Cuvier's work in the line of comparative osteology has never been\r\nsurpassed, perhaps never equalled since, and he is said to have been\r\n\"the greatest naturalist and comparative anatomist of that, or perhaps\r\nof any time.\" (LeConte, \"Evol. and Rel. Thought,\" pp. 33, 34); and yet\r\nhe maintained till the last that all those which we now call the\r\nPleistocene mammals were distinct species from the modern ones; and it\r\nis only of recent years and with extreme reluctance that many of them\r\nhave been admitted to be identical with the ones now living. All of\r\nwhich tends to show how unreliable are those assertions commonly found\r\nin the text-books about all the species of the so-called \"older\" rocks\r\nbeing extinct. It is only with hesitation that such specific\r\ndistinctions are surrendered even to-day, though during the last few\r\ndecades a steady progress has been made in bringing the palaeontology of\r\nthe higher vertebrates into line with our increased knowledge of\r\nzoology, thus breaking down many of the specific distinctions which have\r\nlong been maintained between the fossil and the living forms. Even the\r\nmammoth has been found to have so many characters identical with the\r\nmodern elephant of India, and such a complete gradation exists between\r\nthe two types, that Flower and Lydekker acknowledge the transition from\r\none to the other is \"almost imperceptible,\" and express a doubt whether\r\nthey \"can be specifically distinguished\" from one another.[37]\r\n\r\nBut the extreme reluctance with which anything like a confession of this\r\nfact leaks out in our modern literature can be readily understood when\r\nwe try the hopeless task of splicing the environment of the modern form\r\nwith that of the ancient on any basis of uniformity.\r\n\r\nZittel gives us a peep behind the scenes which helps us to appreciate\r\nthe value of a percentage of extinct species as a test of the age of a\r\nrock deposit.\r\n\r\nHe pictures the uncritical work of the earlier writers on fossil botany,\r\nuntil August Schink (1868-91) made a great reform in this science; and\r\nZittel declares that \"now the author of a paper on any department\" of\r\nfossil botany \"is expected to have a sound knowledge\" of the systematic\r\nbotany of recent forms. But he adds: \"It cannot be said that\r\npalaeozoology (the science of fossil animals) has yet arrived at this\r\ndesirable standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nBut he justifies this charge of want of confidence by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Comparatively few individuals have such a thorough grasp of zoological\r\nand geological knowledge as to enable them to treat palaeontological\r\nresearches worthily, and there has accumulated a dead weight of\r\nstratigraphical-palaeontological literature wherein the fossil remains\r\nof animals are named and pigeon-holed solely as an additional ticket of\r\nthe age of a rock-deposit, with a willful disregard of the much more\r\ndifficult problem of their relationships in the long chain of existence.\r\n\r\n\"The terminology which has been introduced in the innumerable monographs\r\nof special fossil faunas in the majority of cases makes only the\r\nslenderest pretext of any connection with recent systematic zoology; if\r\nthere is a difficulty, then stratigraphical arguments are made the basis\r\nof a solution. Zoological students are, as a rule, too actively engaged\r\nand keenly interested in building up new observations to attempt to\r\nspell through the arbitrary palaeontological conclusions arrived at by\r\nmany stratigraphers, or to revise their labors from a zoological point\r\nof view.\"[38]\r\n\r\nDoubtless this scathing impeachment of the common mania for creating new\r\nnames for the fossils has especial reference to the case of the lower\r\nforms of life. For if, in spite of the brilliant and withal careful work\r\nof Cuvier, Owen, Wallace, Huxley, Ray Lankester, and Leith Adams, with\r\nnumerous others that might be mentioned, there are still grounds for\r\nsuch grave doubts of the values of specific distinctions in the case of\r\nthe mammals, whose general anatomy and life-history are so well known\r\nand their almost countless variations so well studied out, =what must be\r\nthe confusion and inaccuracy= in the case of the lower vertebrates, and\r\nespecially of the invertebrates, whose general life-history in so many\r\ninstances is so dimly understood, and the limits of their variations\r\nabsolutely unknown? Remembering all this, what is our amazement when we\r\nread in this same volume by Professor Zittel[39] that the tendency among\r\nmany modern writers in dealing with these lower forms of life, is toward\r\nthe erection of the closest possible distinctions between genera and\r\nspecies, until recent palaeontological literature is fairly inundated\r\nwith new names; and all this with =the purpose=, unblushingly avowed, of\r\n\"enhancing the value\" of such distinctions as a means of determining the\r\nrelative ages of strata, and to \"bring the ontogenetic and phylogenetic\r\ndevelopment\" of the various forms \"into more =apparent= correspondence.\"\r\nI do not exaggerate in the least, as the reader may see by referring to\r\nZittel's book; though not wishing to make my readers \"spell through\"\r\nanother quite technical paragraph I have refrained from direct\r\nquotation.\r\n\r\nBut surely we have here a most amazing style of reasoning. It is another\r\nclear case of first assuming one's premises, and then proving them by\r\nmeans of one's conclusion. The method here employed seems about like\r\nthis: First assume the succession of life from the low to the high as a\r\nwhole; then in any particular group, as of Brachiopods or Mollusks,\r\ndecide the momentous question as to which came first and which later in\r\n\"geological time\" by comparing them as to size, shape, etc., with the\r\nlive modern individual in its development from the egg to maturity; and\r\nlastly, =take the results= of this alleged chronological arrangement to\r\nprove just =how= the modern forms have evolved. Surely it is a most\r\nfearful example of otherwise intelligent men being hypnotized by their\r\ntheory into blind obedience to its suggestions and necessities.\r\n\r\nNot long ago I had occasion to write to a well-known geologist about a\r\nLower Cambrian mollusk which appears strikingly like a modern species. I\r\ngive below an extract from his reply which bears directly upon this\r\npoint. I withhold the name, for the information was given in a\r\nhalf-confidential manner, but I may say that the author's work on the\r\nPalaeozoic fossils is recognized on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"Some geologists make it a point to =give a new name= to all forms found\r\nin the Palaeozoic rocks, i.e. a name different from those of modern\r\nspecies. I was taken to task by a noted palaeontologist for finding a\r\npupa (a kind of land snail) in Devonian beds; but I could not find any\r\npoint in which it differed from the modern genus [? species]. Yet if I\r\ncould have had more perfect specimens I might have found differences.\"\r\n\r\nSuch disclosures speak volumes for those able to understand; and lead\r\none to receive with a smile the familiar assertion that all the species\r\nof the Palaeozoic and other \"older\" rocks are extinct. And we can now\r\nform a truer estimate of the high scientific accuracy of Lyell's\r\ningenious division of the Tertiary beds, according to the percentage of\r\nliving or extinct Mollusks which they contain.\r\n\r\nBut from the inherent weakness of the argument about extinct species as\r\nthus revealed, it follows that chronological distinctions based on any\r\nproportionate number of extinct species =have absolutely no scientific\r\nvalue=; and hence that the life succession theory finds no support from\r\nthese chronological distinctions, just as we have already seen that it\r\nis without a vestige of support from the stratigraphical argument.\r\n\r\nThe life succession theory has not a single fact to confirm it in the\r\nrealm of nature. It is not the result of scientific research, but purely\r\nthe product of the imagination.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] See p. 39 of this volume.\r\n\r\n[34] \"Intro.

In most of the important groups\r\nof both plants and animals, the detailed knowledge of the fossil forms\r\npreceded the knowledge of the corresponding living forms, just as Zittel\r\nsays that the theories of the igneous origin of the crystalline rocks\r\n\"had been laid without the assistance of chemistry\" and the knowledge of\r\nthe microscopic structure of these rocks.[40] On pp. 128-137 of his\r\n\"History,\" this author shows how, up to 1820, little or nothing of a\r\nscientific character was known of any of the classes of living animals\r\nsave mammals. During the last half century, however, the progress of\r\nscience has been steadily showing case after case where families and\r\ngenera, long boldly said to have been \"extinct\" since \"Palaeozoic time,\"\r\nare found in thriving abundance and in little altered condition in\r\nunsuspected places all over the world. And the point for consideration\r\nhere is the manifest absurdity of these inhabitants of the modern seas\r\nand the modern land =skipping= all the uncounted millions of years from\r\n\"Palaeozoic times\" down to the \"recent,\" for, though found in profuse\r\nabundance in these \"Older\" rocks, not a trace of many of them is to be\r\nfound in all the \"subsequent\" deposits.\r\n\r\nThe proposition here to be considered and proved I shall venture to\r\nformulate as follows:\r\n\r\n=There is a fossil world, and there is a modern living world; the two\r\nresembling one another in various details as well as in a general way;\r\nbut to get the ancestral representatives of many modern types, e.g.,\r\ncountless invertebrates, with other lower forms of animals and plants,\r\nwe must go clear back to the Mesozoic or the Palaeozoic rocks, for they\r\nare not found in any of the \"more recent\" deposits.=\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that the blending of the doctrine of life\r\nsuccession with that of uniformity, must inevitably have given birth to\r\nthe evolution theory, for it is evident that the succession from the low\r\nto the high could only have taken place by each type blending with those\r\nbefore and those after it in the alleged order of time. That such is not\r\nthe testimony of the rocks, even when arranged with this idea in view,\r\nis too notorious to need any words of mine, for it has been considered\r\nby many[41] the \"greatest of all objections\" to the theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nThis abruptness in the disappearance of \"old\" and the first appearance\r\nof \"new\" forms, has brought into being that \"geological scape-goat,\" as\r\nJames Geikie has called the doctrine of the =imperfection of the\r\nrecord=. But Dawson has well disposed of this argument in the following\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"When we find abundance of examples of the young and old of many fossil\r\nspecies, and can trace them through their ordinary embryonic\r\ndevelopment, why should we not find examples of the links which bound\r\nthe species together?\"[42]\r\n\r\nBut it is equally evident that each successive series ought to contain,\r\nin addition to its own characteristic or \"new\" species, =all the older\r\nforms which survived into any later deposits, or are now to be found\r\nliving in our modern world=. Such no doubt was the idea of those of the\r\nearly geological explorers who discarded Werner's onion-coat theory, and\r\nthey tried to arrange their series accordingly. This reasonable demand\r\nis still recognized as good; and the principle is alluded to by Dana\r\nwhen he attempts to show how strata might be discovered and \"proved\" to\r\nbe older than the present Lower Cambrian rocks.[43]\r\n\r\nIt is, I say, still recognized =in theory= that the \"younger\" deposits\r\nought to contain samples of the \"older\" types which were still\r\nsurviving, in addition to their own characteristic species; but with the\r\nprogress of geological discovery it has long since been found that such\r\nan arrangement was utterly impossible. Indeed, it would almost seem as\r\nif modern writers had forgotten the principle altogether.\r\n\r\nFor, as already said, according to the present chronological\r\narrangement, many kinds of invertebrates, both terrestrial and marine,\r\noccurring in comparative abundance in our modern world, are found as\r\nfossils only in the very \"oldest\" rocks and are =wholly absent from all\r\nthe rest!!!= Others which date from \"Mesozoic times\" are wholly absent\r\nfrom the Tertiaries, though abundant in our modern world. This I regard\r\nas another crucial test of the rationality of this idea of a life\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nOf course there are certain limitations which must be borne in mind. If\r\nwe find a series of beds made up largely of deep sea deposits, we cannot\r\nreasonably expect to find in them examples of all the land forms of the\r\npreceding \"ages\" which then survived, nor even of the shallow water\r\ntypes. Nor, conversely, can we demand that, in beds crowded with the\r\nremains of the great mammals and plants, and thus probably of fresh or\r\nshallow water formation, we ought to find examples of all the marine\r\ntypes still surviving. We now know that each level of ocean depth has\r\nits characteristic types of life, just as do the different heights on a\r\nmountain side. This doctrine of \"rock facies\" was, I believe, enunciated\r\nfirst in 1838. Edward Forbes also did much for this same idea, showing\r\nhow at the present time certain faunas are confined to definite\r\ngeographical limits, and particular ocean depths. Jules Marcou about\r\n1848 applied this principle to the fossils and showed how such\r\ndistinctions must have prevailed during geological time.\r\n\r\nHere it seems that we are at last getting a refreshing breath of true\r\nscience; but if carried out in its entirety how shall we assure\r\nourselves that in the long ago very diverse types of fossils, e.g.,\r\ngratolites and nummulites, or even trilobites and mammals, =could not\r\nhave been contemporary with each other=? This principle of \"rock\r\nfacies,\" if incorporated into the science in its early days, would have\r\nsaved the world from a large share of the nonsense in our modern\r\ngeological and zoological text-books.\r\n\r\nBut in answer to any pleadings about the imperfection of the record, or\r\nany protests about the injustice of judging all the life-forms of an\r\n\"age\" by a few examples of local character, i.e., of fresh, shallow, or\r\ndeep water as the case may be, the very obvious retort is, Why then are\r\nsuch local and fragmentary records given =a time value=? Why, for\r\nexample, should the Carboniferous and associated formations be counted\r\nas representing all the deposits made in a certain age of the world,\r\nwhen we know from the Cambrian and Silurian and also from the alleged\r\n\"subsequent\" Jurassic that there must have been vast open sea deposits\r\nformed contemporaneously?\r\n\r\nAs Dana expresses it:\r\n\r\n\"The Lias and Oolyte of Britain and Europe afforded the first full\r\ndisplay of the marine fauna of the world since the era of the\r\nSubcarboniferous. Very partial exhibits were made by the few marine beds\r\nof the Coal measures: still less by the beds of the Permian, and far\r\nless by the Triassic. The seas had not been depopulated. The occurrence\r\nof over 4,000 invertebrate species in Britain in the single Jurassic\r\nperiod is evidence, not of deficient life for the eras preceding, but of\r\nextremely deficient records.\"[44]\r\n\r\nSurely these words exhibit the \"phylogenic series\" in all its native,\r\nunscientific deformity. It is =because= the Coal-measures, the Permian,\r\nand the Triassic, are necessarily \"extremely deficient records\" of the\r\ntotal life-forms then in the world, that I am writing this chapter, and\r\nthis book. But it seems like perverseness to plead about the\r\nimperfection of the record, and yet refuse the =evidently complementary=\r\ndeposits when they are presented. If, as this illustrious author says,\r\n\"The seas had not been depopulated,\" what would he have us think they\r\nwere doing? Were they forming no deposits all these intervening ages\r\nthat the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic were being piled up? Were\r\nthe fishes and invertebrates all immortalized for these ages, or were\r\nthey, when old and full of days translated to some supermundane sphere,\r\nthus escaping deposit in the rocks? Did the elements continue in the\r\n_status quo_ all these uncounted millions of years? and if so, how did\r\nthey receive notice that the Triassic period was at last ended, and that\r\nit was time for them to begin work again? I do not like to appear\r\ntrivial; but these questions serve to expose the folly of taking\r\ndiverse, local, and partial deposits, and attaching a chronological\r\nvalue to each of them separately, and then pleading in a piteous,\r\nhelpless way about the imperfection of the record.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I cannot promise to present a tithe of the possible evidence,\r\nbecause of two serious handicaps. First, the ordinary literature of the\r\nscience is silent and meagre enough in all conscience, even though the\r\nbare fact may be recorded that a \"genus\" of the Cambrian or Silurian is\r\n\"closely allied\" to some genus now living. It may be even admitted that\r\n\"according to some it is not genetically distinct from the modern genus\"\r\nso-and-so; but the authors =never descend below the \"genus,\"= and in\r\nmost cases forget to tell us whether or not it occurs in other \"later\"\r\nformations, though of course the presumption is that it does not, but\r\nhas skipped all the intervening ages, or it would hardly be named as a\r\ncharacteristic type of the formation in which it occurs.\r\n\r\nBut this disadvantage, serious though it be, is scarcely worth speaking\r\nof when we remember the significant words of a well-known authority\r\nalready quoted:\r\n\r\n\"Some geologists make it a point to give a new name to all forms found\r\nin the Palaeozoic rocks, i.e. a name different from those of modern\r\nspecies.\"\r\n\r\nOr Zittel's confession that:\r\n\r\n\"The terminology which has been introduced in the innumerable monographs\r\nof special fossil faunas in the majority of cases makes only the\r\nslenderest pretext of any connection with recent systematic zoology; if\r\nthere is a difficulty, then stratigraphical arguments are made the basis\r\nof a solution. Zoological students are as a rule too actively engaged\r\nand keenly interested in building up new observations to attempt to\r\nspell through the arbitrary palaeontological conclusions arrived at by\r\nmany stratigraphers, or to revise their labors from a zoological point\r\nof view.\"\r\n\r\nHence I have no reluctance in saying that, in the present confused state\r\nof the science, it is utterly impossible to find out the truth as to how\r\nmany hundreds of these \"genera\" of the Paleozoic rocks may have survived\r\nto the present, though having skipped perhaps all the formations of the\r\nintervening millions of years. I doubt not that the number is enormously\r\nlarge, though as I have not attempted \"to spell through the arbitrary\r\npalaeontological conclusions\" scattered through the literature, I can\r\nonly depend on a few though striking examples that lie on the open pages\r\nof the ordinary text-books.\r\n\r\nThe larger mammals can of course furnish us no examples, for the \"age\"\r\nin which they abounded is quite conveniently modern, and is separated\r\nfrom the present by no great lapse of time. Of the smaller marsupials,\r\nquite a number of jaw-bones have been found in the Jurassic and\r\nTriassic, one from the latter being strikingly like the living\r\n_Myrmecobius_ of Australia. They are scarcely more numerous in the\r\nCretaceous of America, while in the foreign rocks of this system Dana\r\nsays that \"Only one species had been reported up to 1894.\" Those\r\nstrange, sad-eyed creatures called Lemurs deserve a passing notice, for\r\nthough now confined as to their typical forms to the island of\r\nMadagascar, their fossils seem as exclusively confined to the temperate\r\nregions of the New and the Old World. Flower and Lydekker enumerate\r\nabout fifteen fossil species, and add that:\r\n\r\n\"... it is very noteworthy that all these types seem to have disappeared\r\nfrom both regions with the close of the upper portion of the Eocene\r\nperiod.\"[45]\r\n\r\nBut this jump from the \"Eocene period\" to the present is as nothing\r\ncompared with the secular acrobatics of some of the fishes and\r\nespecially of the invertebrates. The living Cestraciont sharks, of which\r\nthere are four species found in the seas between Japan and Australia,\r\nseem to disappear with the Cretaceous, skipping the whole Tertiary\r\nEpoch, as do also a tribe of modern barnacles which, as Darwin says,\r\n\"coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers.\" The Dipnoans or\r\nLung-fishes (having lungs as well as gills, such as the _Ceratodus_ and\r\n_Lepidosiren_), which are represented by several living species in\r\nAustralia and South Africa, are the remains of a tribe found in whole\r\nshoals in the Carboniferous, Triassic and Jurassic rocks, but not, so\r\nfar as I know, in any of the intervening rocks. The living Ceratodus was\r\nonly discovered in 1870, and was regarded as a marvel of \"persistence.\"\r\nOn a pinch, as when his native streams dry up, this curious fellow can\r\nget along all right without water, breathing air by his lungs like a\r\nland animal. If in the meantime he was off on a trip to the moon, he\r\nmust have \"persisted\" a few million years without either.\r\n\r\nBut his cousin, the _Polypterus_ of the Upper Nile, has a still more\r\namazing record, for he has actually skipped all the formations from the\r\nDevonian down to the modern; while the Limuloids or sea scorpions have\r\njumped from the Carboniferous down.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusks and Brachiopods would afford us examples too numerous to\r\nmention. How is it possible that these numerous families disappear\r\nsuddenly and completely with the Mesozoic or even the \"early\"\r\nPalaeozoic, and are not found in any \"later\" deposits, though alive now\r\nin our modern world? Parts of Europe and America have, we are told, been\r\ndown under the sea and up again a dozen times since then; why then\r\nshould we not expect to find abundant remains of these \"persistent\"\r\ntypes in the Mesozoic and Tertiaries? Surely these feats of\r\ntime-acrobatics show the folly of arranging contemporaneous, taxonomic\r\ngroups in single file and giving to each a time value.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk points a similar lesson. It was not till the time of the\r\n\"Challenger\" Expedition that the modern deposits of Globigerina ooze,\r\nmade up of species identical with those of the Chalk, were known to be\r\nnow forming over vast areas of the ocean floor. In the words of Huxley,\r\nthese modern species \"bridge over the interval between the present and\r\nthe Mesozoic periods.\"[46]\r\n\r\nAs for the silicious sponges found in the Chalk, which were such puzzles\r\nfor the scientists during the first half of the nineteenth century,\r\nbecause their living forms were unknown, the deep-sea investigations\r\nhave solved the problem, for in 1877 Sollas demonstrated \"the identity\r\nof their structure with that of living Hexactinellids, Lithistids, and\r\nMonactinellids.\"[47]\r\n\r\nAnd yet with all the alleged vicissitudes of the continents during the\r\nmillions of years since the Cretaceous age, there is so far as I am\r\naware not a trace of either the chalk or the sponges in any of the\r\n\"subsequent\" rocks. Pieces of Cretaceous rock are of course found thus\r\nsporadically as boulders, but there is no natural deposit of this kind.\r\nBut in the light of these modern discoveries why is not the Chalk of\r\n\"the white dear cliffs of Dover,\" full of modern living species as we\r\nnow know it to be, just as \"recent\" a deposit as the \"late\" Tertiaries\r\nor the Pleistocene?\r\n\r\nAnother good illustration of the absurdity of the present arrangement of\r\nthe rocks is found in the Echinoderms--crinoids, star-fishes,\r\nsea-urchins, etc. Of the latter Prof. A. Agassiz found in the deep\r\nwaters of the West Indies, four genera of Echinids or sea-urchins of the\r\n\"later Tertiary,\" =but 24 genera of the \"early\" Tertiary, 10 of the\r\nCretaceous, and 5 of the Jurassic=.[48]\r\n\r\nBut far from being uncommon we know that similar discoveries have been\r\nin almost constant progress during the last half century. And were it\r\nnot that \"zoological students are,\" as Zittel says, \"too actively\r\nengaged and keenly interested in building up new observations to attempt\r\nto spell through the arbitrary palaeontological conclusions\" found in\r\nthe \"dead weight of stratigraphical-palaeontological literature,\" there\r\nis no telling what hosts of similar facts might not be pointed to\r\nregarding the forms found in all the \"older\" rocks.\r\n\r\nOf the star-fishes and serpent-stars (_Asteridea_ and _Ophiuridea_),\r\nZittel says: \"It would seem that the Palaeozoic 'sea-stars' differed\r\nvery little from those in the seas of the present age.\" (p. 395.) The\r\ncrinoids, we are told, \"are among the earliest in geological history,\"\r\nmaking up vast limestones of the Palaeozoic rocks; and forms scarcely\r\nseparable from the modern are found in the Jurassic, but so far as the\r\ntext-books tell us are =absolutely unknown in any later deposits=. But\r\nthere are several modern genera, such as Pentacrinus, Rhizocrinus,\r\nBathycrinus, etc., found in the deep waters of nearly all the oceans.\r\nThe genus Rhizocrinus was discovered off the coast of Norway about the\r\nsixties of the last century. But what were these creatures doing since\r\n\"Jurassic times,\" while the \"pulsating crust\" was putting parts of the\r\ncontinents under the sea for ages at a stretch? Why did they form no\r\ndeposits during the Cretaceous, Eocene, Miocene or Pliocene ages? Surely\r\nthe absurdity of the present arrangement is evident to a child. During\r\nall these intervening ages the climate of the globe continued of the\r\nsame remarkable mildness, fossils of all these formations being found\r\nabout as far north as explorers have ever gone. Why did the crinoids and\r\npolyp-corals suspend business from \"Jurassic times\" to the \"recent,\"\r\nmerely to accommodate a modern theory? Dana says that \"The coral reefs\r\nof the Oolyte in England consist of corals of the same group with the\r\nreef-making species of the existing tropics,\"[49] and he argues from\r\nthis fact that the mean temperature of the waters must have been about\r\n69 deg. F. But a luxuriant vegetation still continued in the Arctic\r\nregions during the Cretaceous and the Tertiaries. How absurd to say that\r\nthese corals built no reefs about the European coasts during all these\r\nages. Or, to put the matter in another way, considering how many of\r\ntheir characteristic types are alive in our modern seas, why should we\r\nsay that the crinoidal or coral limestones of the Mesozoic or Palaeozoic\r\nrocks are not as recent as the nummulitic limestones of the Eocene or\r\nany late Tertiary deposits?\r\n\r\nIt is no answer at all to tell us that, though the general types are the\r\nsame, the =species= of the Palaeozoic and the Mesozoic are entirely\r\nextinct. I have not had the courage \"to attempt to spell through\" all\r\nthe \"dead weight\" of the modern literature, but I think that the world\r\nwould like more satisfactory proof of this oft-repeated assertion than\r\nthe customs and traditions of a hundred years, and the exigencies of a\r\nfanciful theory. This worn-out argument of Cuvier's about extinct\r\nspecies has kept up a running fight with common sense for many decades,\r\nand though driven backward from one point to another over the long thin\r\nline of this taxonomic series of the fossil world, it still contests\r\nevery inch of ground.\r\n\r\nBut let us try the tree-ferns and cycads of the coal beds of the \"older\"\r\nrocks. In northern regions they are not found \"later\" than the Triassic\r\nand Jurassic, and doubtless the same holds good of the rocks in the\r\nTropics, where the modern species now live in fair abundance. But how\r\ndid they come to shift to the Tropics so many millions of years before\r\nthe palms, etc., of the Tertiaries thought it time to do the same? The\r\nclimate had not changed a bit: how did they come to scent the coming\r\n\"Glacial Age\" so much earlier than their more highly organized fellows?\r\n\r\nThe \"Challenger\" expedition found some Cyathophylloid corals now\r\nbuilding reefs at the bottom of our modern ocean. The geologists had\r\nalready assigned =the last= of them to the Carboniferous and Permian\r\nrocks with the idea that they were extinct. But where have these fellows\r\nkept themselves during all the intervening ages while the continents\r\nwere deep under the ocean time and time again? or why are not the rocks\r\ncontaining their fossils as \"recent\" as any deposits on the globe?\r\n\r\nAnd so I might go on. There is hardly a tribe found in the \"older\" rocks\r\nwhich does not have its living representatives of to-day, and with, I\r\nbelieve, a fair proportion of the species identical; though in hundreds,\r\nperhaps thousands, of cases these species, genera, or even whole tribes,\r\nhave somehow skipped all the intervening formations.\r\n\r\nBut let us drop this method of studying our subject, and look at it from\r\na slightly different standpoint.\r\n\r\nThus Dana[50] says that:\r\n\r\n\"The absence of Lamellibranchs in the Middle Cambrian, although present\r\nin both Lower and Upper, means =the absence of fossils from the rocks,\r\nnot of species from the faunas=.\"\r\n\r\nHe puts this in italics by way of emphasis, for it is certainly a\r\nreasonable idea, and as A. R. Wallace says, \"no one =now= doubts that\r\nwhere any type appears in two remote periods it must have been in\r\nexistence during the whole intervening period, although we may have no\r\nrecord of it.\"[51] But what would be the result if we only extend this\r\nidea to its logical conclusion? It seems to be an effort to avoid one of\r\nthe absurdities of the onion-coat theory, without, however, discarding\r\nthat theory altogether.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of some corals and crinoids of the Devonian which \"were\r\nabsent\" from some of the divisions of this formation because the\r\nconditions of the seas about New York \"were unfavorable,\" Dana says\r\nthat \"they were back when the seas were again of sufficient purity.\"[52]\r\n\r\nIn his review of these formations he enlarges on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"At the close of the early Devonian the evidences of clear seas--the\r\ncorals and crinoids, with most of the attendant life--disappear,\r\nmigrating no one knows whither.... With the variations in the fineness,\r\nor other characteristics of the beds as H. S. Williams has illustrated,\r\nthe species vary.... =The faunas of each stratum are not strictly faunas\r\nof epochs or periods of time, but local topographical faunas.= After the\r\nCorniferous period, corals, crinoids, and trilobites still flourished\r\n=somewhere=, as before, but they are absent from the Central Interior\r\nuntil the Carboniferous age[53] opens.\"\r\n\r\nHere we are certainly getting a refreshing breath of common-sense\r\ngeology; but what would become of current theories if we enlarge a\r\nlittle on this idea?\r\n\r\nWhat if the gigantic dinosaurs of the Cretaceous or the equally\r\nmarvellous mammals of the \"early\" Tertiaries of the Western States,\r\ndescribed by Marsh and Cope, and the Pleistocene mammals of other parts\r\nof America and of Europe and Northern Siberia, \"are not strictly faunas\r\nof epochs or periods of time, but local topographical faunas?\" What if\r\nthe world-wide limestones of the Cambrian and Silurian, and the no less\r\nenormous or widespread nummulitic limestones of the Eocene, extending\r\nfrom the Alps to Eastern Asia, and constituting mountains ten, fifteen,\r\nor twenty thousand feet high--what if these are possibly\r\n=contemporaneous with one another=? Supposing the coal-measures of Nova\r\nScotia and Pennsylvania, and the Cretaceous and Tertiary lignites of\r\nVancouver Island, Alberta, and the Western States are not strictly\r\nfloras of epochs or periods of time, but local topographical floras?[54]\r\n\r\nBut it must be confessed that the logical extension of this broad view\r\nof the fossils, and the projection of our modern zoological provinces\r\nand zones back into the fossil world would mean the death-blow to the\r\nlife succession theory, and might have a very disturbing effect upon\r\ncertain theories about human origins and other genetic relationships\r\nwhich have grown quite popular since the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] \"History,\" pp. 327, 341.\r\n\r\n[41] See LeConte, \"Evol. and Religious Thought,\" p. 253.\r\n\r\n[42] \"Modern Ideas of Evol.,\" p. 35.\r\n\r\n[43] See \"Manual,\" pp. 487-8.\r\n\r\n[44] \"Manual,\" p. 776.\r\n\r\n[45] \"Mammals, etc.\" p. 696.\r\n\r\n[46] \"Discourses Biol. and Geol.,\" p. 347.\r\n\r\n[47] Zittel, \"Hist. of Geo.,\" p. 388.\r\n\r\n[46] Dana, \"Manual,\" p. 59.\r\n\r\n[49] \"Manual,\" p. 793.\r\n\r\n[50] \"Manual,\" p. 488.\r\n\r\n[51] \"Distribution of Life,\" p. 33.\r\n\r\n[52] \"Manual,\" p. 611.\r\n\r\n[53] \"Manual,\" pp. 628-9.\r\n\r\n[54] Note--This is only carrying the argument a little further than\r\n     Huxley does when he says that \"A Devonian fauna and flora in the\r\n     British Islands may have been contemporaneous with Silurian life in\r\n     North America, and with a Carboniferous fauna and flora in Africa.\r\n     Geographical provinces and zones may have been as distinctly marked\r\n     in the Palaeozoic epoch as at present.\" \"Discourses,\" p. 286.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGRAVEYARDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The crust of our globe,\" writes a distinguished scientist, \"is a great\r\ncemetery, where the rocks are tombstones on which the buried dead have\r\nwritten their own epitaphs.\" The reading of these epitaphs is the\r\nbusiness of geology; and too often, as we shall see, the record is that\r\nof a violent and sudden death.\r\n\r\nWith the doctrine of Uniformity as a theoretical proposition, I shall\r\nhave little to say. At best it is a pure assumption that the present\r\nquiet and regular action of the elements has always prevailed in the\r\npast, or that this supposition is sufficient to explain the facts of the\r\nrocks. In its more extreme form it becomes an iron dogma, which shuts\r\nout all evidence not agreeable to its teachings. But in its essential\r\nnature, whether in its least or its most extreme form, it is not\r\napproaching the subject from the right standpoint. It seeks to show how\r\nthe past geological changes may have occurred; it never attempts to\r\nprove how they =must= have occurred. And I may say in passing, that it\r\nis largely for the purpose of avoiding the cumulative character of the\r\nevidence gathered from every stone quarry and from every section of\r\nstrata in every corner of the globe, that the uniformitarians have\r\nwished to have these burials take place on the installment plan; for\r\notherwise the violent and catastrophic character of the events recorded\r\nin the rocks would become too plainly manifest. But if a coroner, called\r\nupon to hold an inquest, were to content himself, after the manner of\r\nLyell and Hutton, with glittering generalities about how people are all\r\nthe time dying of old age, fever, or other causes, coupled with\r\nassurances of the quiet, regular habits and good reputation of all his\r\nfellow citizens, I do not think that he would be praised for his\r\nadherence to inductive methods if we could get at clear and decisive\r\nevidence that the poor fellow under examination had been shot. Just so\r\nwith common-sense methods in geology. =A true induction is capable of\r\nfinding out for certain= whether or not the present quiet regular action\r\nof the elements has always prevailed in the past; and it is most\r\nunscientific to assume, as the followers of Hutton and Lyell have done,\r\nthat the comparatively insignificant changes within historic time have\r\nalways prevailed in the past, when there is plenty of clear and decisive\r\nevidence to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe general fact which I wish to develop in this chapter may be stated\r\nsomewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n=Rocks belonging to all the various systems or formations give us\r\nfossils in such a state of preservation, and heaped together in such\r\nastonishing numbers, that we cannot resist the conviction that the\r\nmajority of these deposits were formed in some sudden and not modern\r\nmanner, catastrophic in nature.=\r\n\r\nBut before giving any examples of these abnormal deposits we must first\r\nstudy the modern normal deposits; before we can rightly understand the\r\nsharp contrast between the ancient and the modern action of the\r\nelements, we must become familiar with the way in which fossils are now\r\nbeing buried by our rivers and oceans.\r\n\r\nOne of the many geological myths dissipated by the work of the\r\n\"Challenger\" Expedition, which, as Zittel says, \"marks the grandest\r\nscientific event of the nineteenth century,\" is that about the ocean\r\nbottom and the work now being carried on there. The older text-books\r\ntaught that, not only was the bottom of the ocean thickly strewn with\r\nthe remains of the animals which died there and in the waters above, but\r\nalso that the oceanic currents were constantly wearing away in some\r\nplaces and building up in others over all the ocean floor, and hence\r\nproducing true stratified deposits. Accordingly it was said that it was\r\nonly necessary for these beds to be lifted above the surface to produce\r\nthe ordinary rocks that we find everywhere about us. But we now know\r\nthat the ocean currents have, as Dana says, \"no sensible, mechanical\r\neffects, either in the way of transportation or abrasion.\"[55] We know\r\nalso that all kinds of sediment drop so much quicker in salt water than\r\nin fresh, that none of it gets beyond the narrow \"continental shelf\" and\r\nthe classic 100 fathom line, which in most cases is not very far from\r\nshore. In the north Atlantic there are sediments found in deeper water\r\nproduced by ice-floes or icebergs dropping their loads there; but we\r\ncannot suppose such work to have gone on when the Arctic regions were\r\nclothed with a temperate-climate vegetation, much less that such things\r\noccurred over all the earth. On the floor of the open ocean, and away\r\nfrom the tracks of our modern icebergs, we have two or three kinds of\r\nmud or ooze formed from minute particles of organic matter; but besides\r\nthese =absolutely nothing= save a possible sprinkling of volcanic\r\nproducts, which of course are limited in their distribution. Where then\r\ncan we find a stratified or bedded structure now being formed over the\r\nocean bottom? Dana says there is nothing of the kind now being produced\r\nthere, save as the result of possible variations during the passing ages\r\nin the organic deposits thrown down, where a bed of ooze may be supposed\r\nto be thrown down directly upon another kind of ooze. There is =no\r\ngravel=, =no sand=, =no clay=, but whatever variation there might be in\r\nthe organic deposits, the new kind would be laid down immediately upon\r\nthe preceding similar deposits, unless a thin sprinkling of volcanic\r\ndust happened to intervene.\r\n\r\nThus to explain practically all the deposits found in the rocks, we are\r\nabsolutely limited to the shore deposits and the mouths of large rivers.\r\nHere we certainly have alternations of sand, clay and gravel, producing\r\na true bedded structure. But I ask: What kind of organic remains will we\r\nget from these modern deposits? Certainly nothing like the crowded\r\ngraveyards which we find everywhere in the ancient ones.\r\n\r\nDarwin, in his famous chapter on \"The Imperfection of the Geological\r\nRecord,\" has well shown how scanty and imperfect are the modern\r\nfossiliferous deposits. The progress of research has only confirmed and\r\naccentuated the argument there presented on this point. Thus\r\nNordenskiold, the veteran Arctic explorer, remarks with amazement on the\r\nscarcity of recent organic remains in the Arctic regions, where such a\r\nprofusion of animal life exists; while in spite of the great numbers of\r\ncats, dogs and other domestic animals which are constantly being thrown\r\ninto rivers like the Hudson or the Thames, dredgings about their mouths\r\nhave revealed the surprising fact that scarcely a trace of any of them\r\nis there to be found.[56]\r\n\r\nEven the fishes themselves stand a very poor chance of being buried\r\nintact. As Dana[57] puts it:\r\n\r\n\"Vertebrate animals, as fishes, reptiles, etc., which fall to pieces\r\nwhen the animal portion is removed, =require speedy burial after death=,\r\nto escape destruction from this source (decomposition and chemical\r\nsolution from air, rain-water, etc.), as well as from animals that would\r\nprey upon them.\"\r\n\r\nIf a vertebrate fish should die a natural death, which of itself must be\r\na rare occurrence, the carcass would soon be devoured whole or bit by\r\nbit by other creatures near by. Possibly the lower jaw, or the teeth,\r\nspines, etc., in the case of sharks, or a bone or two of the skeleton,\r\nmight be buried unbroken, but a whole vertebrate fish entombed in a\r\nmodern deposit is surely a unique occurrence.\r\n\r\nBut every geologist knows that the remains of fishes are, in countless\r\nmillions of cases, found in a marvelous state of preservation. They have\r\nbeen entombed in =whole shoals=, with the beds containing them miles in\r\nextent, and scattered over all the globe. Indeed, so accustomed have we\r\ngrown to this state of affairs in the rocks we hammer up, that if we\r\nfail to find such well-preserved remains of vertebrate fishes, land\r\nanimals, or plants, we feel disappointed, almost hurt; we think that\r\nnature has somehow slighted this particular set of beds. But where in\r\nour modern quiet earth will we go to find deposits now forming like the\r\ncopper slate of the Mansfield district, the Jurassic shales of\r\nSolenhofen, the calcareous marls of Oeningen on Lake Constance, the\r\nblack slates of Glarus, or the shales of Monte Bolca?--to mention some\r\ncases from the Continent of Europe more than usually famous in the\r\nliterature for exquisitely preserved vertebrate fishes, to say nothing\r\nof other fossils. According to Dana, all these must have met with a\r\n\"speedy burial after death\"--perhaps before, who knows?\r\n\r\nBuckland[58] in speaking of the fossil fish of Monte Bolca, which may be\r\ntaken as typical of all the others, is quite positive that these fish\r\nmust have \"perished suddenly,\" by some tremendous catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"The skeletons of these fish,\" he says, \"lie parallel to the laminae of\r\nthe strata of the calcareous slate; they are always entire, and so\r\nclosely packed on one another that many individuals are often contained\r\nin a single block.... =All these fish must have died suddenly= on this\r\nfatal spot, and have been speedily buried in the calcareous sediment\r\nthen in course of deposition. From the fact that certain individuals\r\nhave even preserved traces of color upon their skin, we are certain that\r\nthey were entombed before decomposition of their soft parts had taken\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\nIn many places in America as well as Europe, where these remains of fish\r\nare found, the shaley rock is so full of fish oil that it will burn\r\nalmost like coal, while some have even thought that the peculiar\r\ndeposits like Albertite \"coal\" and some cannel coals were formed from\r\nthe distillation of the fish oil from the supersaturated rocks.\r\n\r\nDe La Beche[59] was also of the opinion that most of the fossils were\r\nburied suddenly and in an abnormal manner. \"A very large proportion of\r\nthem,\" he says, \"must have been =entombed uninjured, and many alive=,\r\nor, if not alive, at least before decomposition ensued.\" In this he is\r\nspeaking not of the fishes alone but of the fossiliferous deposits in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThere is a series of strata found in all parts of the world which used\r\nto be called the \"Old Red Sandstone,\" now known as the Devonian. In\r\nthis, almost wherever we find it, the remains of whole shoals of fishes\r\noccur in such profusion and preservation that the \"period\" is often\r\nknown as the \"Age of Fishes.\" Dr. David Page, after enumerating nearly a\r\ndozen genera, says:\r\n\r\n\"These fishes seem to have thronged the waters of the period, and their\r\nremains are often found in masses, =as if they had been suddenly\r\nentombed in living shoals= by the sediment which now contains them.\"\r\n\r\nI beg leave to quote somewhat at length the picturesque language of Hugh\r\nMiller[60] regarding these rocks as found in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\"The river bull-head, when attacked by an enemy, or immediately as it\r\nfeels the hook in its jaws, erects its two spines at nearly right angles\r\nwith the plates of the head, as if to render itself as difficult of\r\nbeing swallowed as possible. The attitude is one of danger and alarm;\r\nand it is a curious fact, to which I shall afterward have occasion to\r\nadvert, that =in this attitude nine-tenths of the= _Pterichthes_ =of the\r\nLower Old Red Sandstone are to be found=.... It presents us, too, with a\r\nwonderful record of violent death falling at once, not on a few\r\nindividuals, but on whole tribes.\"\r\n\r\n\"At this period of our history, some terrible catastrophe involved in\r\nsudden destruction the fish of an area at least a hundred miles from\r\nboundary to boundary, perhaps much more. The same platform in Orkney as\r\nat Cromarty is strewed thick with remains, which exhibit unequivocally\r\nthe marks of violent death. The figures are contorted, contracted,\r\ncurved, the tail in many instances is bent round to the head; the spines\r\nstick out; the fins are spread to the full, as in fish that die in\r\nconvulsions.... The record is one of destruction at once widely spread\r\nand total, so far as it extended.... By what quiet but potent agency of\r\ndestruction were the innumerable existences of =an area perhaps ten\r\nthousand square miles in extent annihilated at once=, and yet the medium\r\nin which they had lived left undisturbed in its operations?\r\n\r\n\"Conjecture lacks footing in grappling with the enigma, and expatiates\r\nin uncertainty over all the known phenomena of death.\"\r\n\r\nI shall not taunt the uniformitarians by asking them to direct us to\r\nsome modern analogies. But I would have the reader remember that these\r\nDevonian and other rocks are absolutely world-wide in extent.\r\n\r\nSurely Howorth is talking good science when he says that his masters\r\nSedgwick and Murchison taught him \"that no plainer witness is to be\r\nfound of any physical fact than that Nature has at times worked with\r\nenormous energy and rapidity,\" and \"that the rocky strata teem with\r\nevidence of violent and sudden dislocations on a great scale.\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken only of the class Fishes. But what other class of the\r\nanimal kingdom will not point us a similar lesson? The Reptiles and\r\nAmphibians, to say nothing of the larger Mammals, are also found in\r\ncountless myriads, packed together as if in natural graveyards.\r\nEverybody knows of the enormous numbers and splendid preservation of the\r\ngreat reptiles of the Western and Southern States, untombed by Leidy,\r\nCope and Marsh. One patch of Cretaceous strata in England, the Wealden,\r\nhas afforded over thirty different species of dinosaurs, crocodiles, and\r\npleisosaurs. Mr. Chas. H. Sternberg, one of Zittel's assistants,\r\nrecently reported great quantities of Amphibians from the Permian of\r\nTexas. They are of all sizes, some frogs being six feet long, others\r\nten. Besides these he found three \"bone-beds\" full of minute forms an\r\ninch or less in length. Of the small ones, which I judge must represent\r\nwhole millions of young ones =suddenly= entombed, he says:\r\n\r\n\"I got over twenty perfect skulls, many with vertebrae attached, and\r\nthousands of small bones from all parts of the skeleton. In one case, a\r\ncomplete skull, one-fourth of an inch in length, had connected with it\r\nnearly the entire vertebral column, with ribs in position, coiled upon\r\nitself, bedded with many bones of other species in a red silicious\r\nmatrix. So perfectly were they weathered out that they lay in bas-relief\r\n=as white and perfect as if they had died a month ago=; a single row of\r\nteeth, =like the points of cambric needles=, occupied both sets of\r\njaws.\"[61]\r\n\r\nHow many more such cases there may have been in these \"three bone-beds\r\nfull\" of similar remains, it would be interesting to know. But though\r\nsomewhat aside from the present subject, I cannot refrain in passing\r\nfrom referring to the wonderful preservation of these remains. It is\r\npreposterous to say that these bones have lain thus exposed to the\r\nweather for the millions of years postulated by the popular theory.\r\nThere is not a particle of scientific evidence to prove that they are\r\nnot just as recent as any specimen from the Tertiaries or the\r\nPleistocene. Buffon and Cuvier proved the mammals to be of \"recent\" age,\r\nbecause they occurred in the superficial deposits. They never heard of\r\nthe Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous of Colorado and Wyoming, nor\r\nthese Permian of Texas. Think of this frog's teeth \"like the points of\r\ncambric needles,\" and he and his fellows \"as perfect as if they had died\r\na month ago.\" Of one of the big six-foot specimens this author says:\r\n\"Its head was so beautifully preserved, and cleaned under long erosion,\r\nit was difficult to believe it was not a recent specimen.\" While of the\r\nlittle six-inch fellow referred to above he says: \"The bones of the\r\nskull are perfectly preserved, quite smooth, and show the sutures\r\ndistinctly; there is no distortion, some red matrix attached below seems\r\nabsolutely necessary to convince the mind that it is not =a thing of\r\nyesterday=.\" James Geikie[62] mentions the case of the Elgin sandstones\r\n\"formerly classed as 'Old Red,'\" but which are now called Triassic,\r\n\"from the fact that they have yielded reptilian remains of a higher\r\ngrade than one would expect to meet with in old Red Sandstone.\" Since\r\nthese strata =slide up and down so easily=, we have here far more urgent\r\nscientific reasons for calling these amphibian remains of Texas among\r\nthe most \"recent\" geological deposits on the globe.\r\n\r\nBut I must return to my subject. The Invertebrates are also eloquent to\r\nthe fact of abnormal conditions having prevailed when their remains were\r\nentombed. We could go through the whole list, but it is the same old\r\nstory of abnormal deposits, essentially different from anything that is\r\nbeing made to-day.\r\n\r\nWhere, for instance, in the modern seas, will we find the remains of\r\npolyp-corals now being intercalated between beds of clays or sands over\r\nvast areas, as we find them in the Lias and Oolyte of England and\r\nelsewhere? Corals require a definite depth of water, neither too deep\r\nnor too shallow, but it must be clear and pure; and nothing but some\r\nawful catastrophe could place a bed of coral remains a few feet or a\r\n=few inches= in thickness over the vast areas that we find them.\r\nCrinoids require the same clear, pure water, but much deeper, some of\r\nthe modern kinds living =over a mile down=, but every student of the\r\nscience knows that the Subcarboniferous limestone of both Europe and\r\nAmerica (called Mountain Limestone in England), so noted for its\r\ncrinoids and its corals, is constantly found intercalated between shale\r\nor sandstone, or between the coal beds themselves as at Springfield,\r\nIll., or in the Lower Coal Measures of Westmorland County, Pa. There are\r\nof course, here and there, great masses of these rocks which represent\r\nan original formation by growth _in situ_; but no sane man can say this\r\nfor these great sheets perhaps =only a few inches= in thickness, for in\r\nmany cases they show a stratified or bedded structure just as much as a\r\nsandstone or a shale. In some tables given by Dana on pp. 651-2 of his\r\n\"Manual,\" compiled from four different localities, I count no less than\r\n=23 beds= of limestone thus intercalated, though we are not told how\r\nmany of them contain corals or crinoids. Such details are generally\r\nomitted as of little consequence.\r\n\r\nNext, let us try the Lamellibranchs, such as the clam, oyster, and other\r\ntrue bivalves. These creatures have an arrangement in the hinge region\r\nby which the valves of the shell tend to open, but during life are held\r\ntogether by the adductor muscles. When dead, however, these muscles\r\nrelax and decay, and then the valves spread wide open. Of course there\r\nare some, such as certain kinds of clams, which burrow in the mud or\r\nsand, and the shells of these, if they happened to die a natural death\r\nin their holes, could not spread very far apart. However =some mud= must\r\neven then wash into their burrows and into their empty shells. But many\r\nkinds of bivalves do not thus burrow in the ground; and when the fossils\r\nof such kinds are found in quantity with the valves =applied= and often\r\n=hollow=, as is so frequently the case in many of the \"older\" rocks, I\r\ncannot see how we are to understand any ordinary conditions of deposit.\r\nAnd yet we are gravely assured by a high authority, that \"A sudden\r\nburial is not necessary to entombment in this condition.\"\r\n\r\nOr, let us take the Brachiopods. These have a bivalve shell, the parts\r\nof which, however, are not pulled apart after death, and only need to\r\nopen a little way even in life to admit the sea water which brings them\r\ntheir food. Yet, though the valves do not gape after death, there is\r\nwhen dead and empty a =hole= at the hinge or beak, which would readily\r\nadmit mud if such were present in the water, or if the shells after\r\ndeath were subject to the ordinary movements of tide, wave and current.\r\nYet Dawson[63] says of the Brachiopods, Spirifer and Athyris:\r\n\r\n\"I may mention here that in all the Carboniferous limestones of Nova\r\nScotia the shells of this family are usually found with the valves\r\nclosed and =the interior often hollow=.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he tries to explain how this state of things might occur \"in\r\ndeep and clear water\"--for some of the modern species are found in the\r\nclear depths 18,000 feet down--and he thinks that their entombment in\r\nthis condition \"does not prove that the death of the animals was\r\nsudden.\" But we now know that there is no means of producing a\r\nstratified formation in this \"deep and clear water,\" and hence that some\r\nrevolution of nature is implied by the conditions in which we find them.\r\n\r\nSome people seem to have converted David Hume's famous sentence into a\r\nscientific formula, thus: \"Anything contrary to Uniformity is\r\nimpossible: hence no amount of evidence can prove anything contrary to\r\nUniformity.\"\r\n\r\nFor the trouble in this case is that, not only do such conditions\r\nprevail \"in all the Carboniferous limestones of Nova Scotia,\" which must\r\nbe several thousands of square miles in extent, but in the Devonian\r\nshales and Silurian limestones of Ontario and the Middle States at\r\nleast--perhaps over the rest of the world--the Brachiopods are found =in\r\nthis same tell-tale condition=, and it would establish a very dangerous\r\nprecedent to admit abnormal conditions in even a single case.\r\n\r\nI have only touched upon the voluminous evidence that might be adduced\r\nin the case of the lower forms of life. Had I the space, I might show\r\nhow the marvelously preserved plants of the coal beds tell the same\r\nstory. But we must pass on to consider the remains of the larger land\r\nanimals. I have already given a quotation from Dana about the mammoth\r\nand rhinoceros in Northern Siberia, where he says that their encasing in\r\nice and the perfect preservation of their flesh \"shows that the cold\r\nfinally became =suddenly= extreme, as of a single winter's night, and\r\nknew no relenting afterward.\" Not very many serious attempts have been\r\nmade to account for this remarkable state of things, which is a protest\r\nagainst uniformity that can be appreciated by a child, and I never heard\r\nof any theory which attempted to account for the facts without some kind\r\nof awful catastrophe.\r\n\r\nMany, however, seem to have little idea of the extent of these remains\r\nin the Arctic regions. They are not all thus perfectly preserved, for\r\nthousands of skeletons are found in localities where the ground thaws\r\nout somewhat in the short summer, and here of course, the skin and\r\ntissues could not remain intact. Remains of these beasts occur in only a\r\nlittle less abundance over all Western Europe, and the mammoth also in\r\nNorth America, well preserved specimens having been obtained from the\r\nKlondike region of Alaska; and there is nothing to forbid the idea that\r\nmany, if not most of these latter specimens were also at one time\r\nenshrined as \"mummies\" in the ice, which has since melted over the more\r\ntemperate regions. But we must confine ourselves to the remains in\r\nSiberia. Flower and Lydekker tell us that since the tenth century at\r\nleast, these remains have been quarried for the sake of the ivory tusks,\r\nand a regular trade in this fossil ivory, in a state fit for commercial\r\npurposes, has been carried on \"both eastward to China, and westward to\r\nEurope,\" and that \"fossil ivory has its price current as well as wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are found at all suitable places along the whole line of the shore\r\nbetween the mouth of the Obi and Behring Straits, and the further north\r\nthe more numerous do they become, the islands of New Siberia being now\r\none of the favorite collecting localities. The soil of Bear Island and\r\nof Liachoff Islands is said to consist only of sand and ice with such\r\nquantities of mammoth bones as almost to compose its chief substance.\r\nThe remains are not only found around the mouths of the great rivers, as\r\nwould be the case if the carcasses had been washed down from more\r\nsouthern localities in the interior of the continent, but are imbedded\r\nin the frozen soil in such circumstances as to indicate that the animals\r\nhad lived not far from the localities in which they are now found, and\r\nthey are exposed either by the melting of the ice in unusually warm\r\nsummers, or by the washing away of the sea cliffs or river banks by\r\nstorms or floods. In this way the bodies of more or less nearly perfect\r\nanimals, even standing in the erect position, with the soft parts and\r\nhairy covering entire, have been brought to light.\"[64]\r\n\r\nBut these remains of the mammoth, though the best known, are not the\r\nonly ones attesting extraordinary conditions: though of course in warmer\r\nlatitudes we do not find perfect \"mummies\" with the hide and flesh\r\npreserved untainted. Let us go to a warmer climate, to Sicily, and read\r\na description of the remains of the hippopotamus found there. I quote\r\nfrom Sir Joseph Prestwich:\r\n\r\n\"The chief localities, which centre on the hills around Palermo, arrest\r\nattention from the extraordinary quantity of bones of _Hippopotami_ (in\r\ncomplete hecatombs) which have there been found. Twenty tons of these\r\nbones were shipped from around the one cave of San Ciro, near Palermo,\r\nwithin the first six months of exploiting them, and they were so fresh\r\nthat they were sent to Marseilles to furnish animal charcoal for use in\r\nthe sugar factories. How could this bone breccia have been\r\naccumulated?... The only suggestion that has been made is that the bones\r\nare those of successive generations of _Hippopotami_ which went there to\r\ndie. But this is not the habit of the animal, and besides, the bones are\r\nthose of animals =of all ages down to the foetus=, nor do they show\r\ntraces of weathering or exposure....\r\n\r\n\"My supposition is, therefore, that when the island was submerged, the\r\nanimate in the plain of Palermo naturally retreated, as the waters\r\nadvanced, deeper into the amphitheatre of hills until they found\r\nthemselves embayed, as in a seine, with promontories running out to sea\r\non either side and a mural precipice in front. As the area became more\r\nand more circumscribed the animals must have thronged together in vast\r\nmultitudes, crushing into the more accessible caves, and swarming over\r\nthe ground at their entrance, until overtaken by the waters and\r\ndestroyed.\"[65]\r\n\r\nOur author then adds this summary of his argument:\r\n\r\n\"The extremely fresh condition of the bones, proved by the retention of\r\nso large a proportion of animal matter, and the fact that animals of all\r\nages were involved in the catastrophe, shows that the event was\r\ngeologically, comparatively recent, as other facts show it to have been\r\nsudden.\"\r\n\r\nThat it must have been a good deal more \"sudden\" than even this author\r\nwill admit, is evident from the nature of the hippopotamus. I never\r\nthought that it was particularly afraid of the water, or likely to be\r\ndrowned by any such moderate catastrophe as Prestwich invokes in this\r\nsingular volume. The reader must, however, note that this affair, like\r\nthe entombment of the mammoth, certainly =took place since man was upon\r\nthe globe=, even according to the uniformitarians. Would it not be\r\neconomy of energy to correlate the two together? But if man dates from\r\n\"Miocene times,\" as some contend, he must have witnessed half a dozen\r\nawful affairs like these, for there is scarcely a country on the globe\r\nthat has not been under the ocean since then.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed.\r\n\r\nBut whither shall we turn to avoid finding similar phenomena? The vast\r\ndeposits of mammals in the Rocky Mountains may occur to the reader. As\r\nDana says, they \"have been found to be literally Tertiary burial\r\ngrounds.\" I need not go into the details of these deposits, nor of those\r\nin other places containing the great mammals which must have been\r\ncontemporary with \"Tertiary man,\" for I would only weary the reader with\r\na monotony of abnormal conditions of deposit--unlike anything now being\r\nproduced this wide world over. We shall be stating the case very mildly\r\nindeed, if we conclude that the vast majority of the fossils, by their\r\nprofuse abundance and their astonishing preservation, tell a very plain\r\nstory of \"speedy burial after death,\" and =are of an essentially\r\ndifferent character= from modern deposits.\r\n\r\nProf. Nicholson, in speaking of the remains of the Zeuglodon, says:\r\n\r\n\"Remains of these gigantic whales are very common in the 'Jackson beds'\r\nof the Southern United States. So common are they that, according to\r\nDana, 'the large vertebrae, some of them a foot and a half long and a\r\nfoot in diameter, were formerly so abundant over the country in Alabama\r\nthat they were used for making walls, or were burned to rid the fields\r\nof them.'\"[66]\r\n\r\nShortly before his death in 1895, Dana prepared a revised edition of his\r\n\"Manual,\" and in it he gives us quite a rational explanation of this\r\ncase, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Vertebrae were so abundant, on the first discovery, in some places that\r\nmany of these Eocene whales must have been stranded together in a common\r\ncatastrophe, on the northern borders of the Mexican Gulf--possibly by a\r\nseries of earthquake waves of great violence; or by an elevation along\r\nthe sea limit that made a confined basin of the border region, which the\r\nhot sun rendered destructive alike to Zeuglodons and their game; or by\r\nan unusual retreat of the tide, which left them dry and floundering\r\nunder a tropical sun.\" (p. 908.)\r\n\r\nThat is, this veteran geologist in his old age would not attempt to\r\naccount for such abnormal conditions without a catastrophe of some kind.\r\nBut if we use similar explanations for similar conditions, where shall\r\nwe stop through the whole range of the rocks from the Cambrian to the\r\nPleistocene?\r\n\r\nDana became very fond of this idea of earthquake waves, and invoked them\r\nto account for \"the universality and abruptness\" with which the species\r\ndisappear at the close of \"Palaeozoic time,\" using as the generating\r\ncause the uplifting of the Appalachian Mountains, with \"flexures miles\r\nin height and space, and slips along newly opened fractures that kept up\r\ntheir interrupted progress through thousands of feet of displacement,\"\r\nfrom which he says \"incalculable violence and great surgings of the\r\nocean should have occurred and been often repeated.... Under such\r\ncircumstances the devastation of the sea border and the low-lying lands\r\nof the period, the destruction of their animals and plants, would have\r\nbeen a sure result. The survivors within a long distance of the coast\r\nline would have been few.\"[67]\r\n\r\nBut as this sudden break in the life-chain \"was so general and extensive\r\nthat no Carboniferous species is known to occur among the fossils of\r\nsucceeding beds, not only in America and Europe, but also over the rest\r\nof the world\" (p. 735), he is obliged to make his catastrophe by\r\nearthquake waves positively =world wide=. Hence he adds: \"The same waves\r\nwould have swept over European land and seas, and there found coadjutors\r\nfor new strife in earthquake waves of European origin.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Mesozoic he uses similar language, though in this\r\ncase he has the whole range of the mountains on the west of both North\r\nand South America, the Rockies and the Andes, in length a \"third of the\r\ncircumference of the globe,\" \"undergoing simultaneous orogenic\r\nmovements, with like grand results.\" (p. 875.) \"The deluging waves sent\r\ncareering over the land\" would, he thinks, \"have been destructive over\r\nall the coasts of a hemisphere,\" and \"may have made their marches inland\r\nfor hundreds of miles\" (p. 878), sweeping all before them.\r\n\r\nI should think so; but then what becomes of this doctrine of uniformity?\r\nPersonally, I have not the slightest objection to these \"deluging waves\r\nsent careering over the land,\" for I feel sure that just such things\r\nhave occurred, and on just such a scale as our author pictures, for, as\r\nhe says, the destruction of species \"was great, =world-wide=, and one of\r\nthe most marvelous events in geological history.\" (p. 877.)\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that here we have an enormous amount of energy going\r\nto waste. Others have demanded a continent to explain the appearance of\r\na beetle in a certain locality; but here we have a great world-wide\r\ncatastrophe to explain the sudden disappearance of merely a few species.\r\nWhy not utilize this surplus energy in doing other necessary work, that\r\nhas certainly been accomplished somehow, but has hitherto gone a-begging\r\nfor a competent cause? The only thing I object to in Dana's view of the\r\ncase is his way of having these \"exterminations\" take place on the\r\ninstallment plan. For in that way we have to work up a great world\r\ncatastrophe to do only a very limited amount of work, and then have to\r\nrepeat the thing another time for a similarly limited work, =when one\r\nsuch cosmic convulsion is competent to do the whole thing=. I plead for\r\nthe \"law of parsimony,\" and the economizing of energy.\r\n\r\nThe vast shoals of carcasses which seem to be piled up in almost every\r\ncorner of the world are _prima facie_ evidence that our old globe has\r\nwitnessed some sort of cosmic convulsion. The exact cause, nature, and\r\nextent of this event we may never have sufficient facts to determine,\r\nthough two or three additional facts having a bearing on the subject\r\nwill be considered in the following chapters.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] \"Manual,\" p. 229.\r\n\r\n[56] _Pop.

And it was the\r\noverwhelming evidence on this point which forced Lyell and so many\r\nothers to decide against the theory of Croll, which called for a regular\r\nrotation of climates, for they said that the fossil evidence was wholly\r\nagainst such a view. Howorth has given an admirable argument on this\r\npoint in Chapter XI of his second work on the Glacial Theory[68] and to\r\nit I would refer the reader for details which I have not the space to\r\nreproduce here.\r\n\r\nThis author first remarks:\r\n\r\n\"The best thermometer we can use to test the character of a climate is\r\nthe flora and fauna which lived while it prevailed. This is not only the\r\nbest, but is virtually the only thermometer available when we inquire\r\ninto the climate of past geological ages. Other evidence is always\r\nsophisticated by the fact that we may be attributing to climate what is\r\ndue to other causes; boulders can be rolled by the sea as well as by\r\nsub-glacial streams, and conglomerates can be formed by other agencies\r\nthan ice. But the biological evidence is unmistakable; cold-blooded\r\nreptiles cannot live in icy water; semi-tropical plants, or plants whose\r\nhabitat is in the temperate zone, cannot ripen their seeds and sow\r\nthemselves under arctic conditions.... We may examine the whole series\r\nof geological horizons, from the earliest Palaeozoic beds down to the\r\nso-called Glacial beds, and find, so far as I know, no adequate evidence\r\nof discontinuous and alternating climates, no evidence whatever of the\r\nexistence of periods of intense cold intervening between warm periods,\r\nbut just the contrary. Not only so, but we shall find that the\r\ndifferentiation of the earth's climate into tropical and arctic zones is\r\ncomparatively modern, and that in past ages not only were the climates\r\nmore uniform, but more evenly distributed over the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to follow through the whole series of formations we\r\nmay note a few characteristic statements of the text-books. Thus Dana\r\nsays of the Cambrian:\r\n\r\n\"There was no frigid zone, and there may have been no excessively torrid\r\nzone.\"\r\n\r\nWhile of the Silurian coral limestones of the Arctic regions he says:\r\n\r\n\"The formation of thick strata of limestone shows that life like that of\r\nthe lower latitudes not only existed there, but flourished in\r\nprofusion.\"[69]\r\n\r\nHoworth thus quotes Colonel Fielden, the Arctic explorer, regarding the\r\nfossil Sclerodermic corals of the Silurian, widely distributed in the\r\nArctic regions:\r\n\r\n\"These undoubted reef-forming corals of the Silurian epoch were just as\r\nmuch inhabitants of warm water in northern latitudes at that period as\r\nare the Sclerodermata of to-day in the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic\r\noceans.... These corals were forms of life which must have been tropical\r\nin habits and requirement.\"\r\n\r\nIn fact coral limestones of the Carboniferous system are the nearest\r\nknown fossiliferous rocks to the North Pole, and from the strike of the\r\nbeds must underlie the Polar Sea. In the words of Howorth, \"Coal strata\r\nwith similar fossils have occurred all round the Polar basin ... and may\r\nbe said, therefore, to have occupied a continuous cap around the North\r\nPole.\"[70]\r\n\r\nAgain I quote from Howorth regarding the Mesozoic rocks:\r\n\r\n\"This very widespread fauna and flora proves that the high temperature\r\nof the Secondary era prevailed in all latitudes, and not only so, it\r\npervaded them apparently continuously without a break. There is no\r\nevidence whatever, known to me, that can be derived from the fauna and\r\nflora of Secondary times, which points to any period of cold as even\r\npossible. There are no shrunken and stunted forms, and no types such as\r\nwe associate with cold conditions, and no changes evidenced by\r\nintercalated beds showing vicissitudes of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is from Nordenskiold, as quoted by Howorth, and refers to\r\nthe whole geological series:\r\n\r\n\"From what has been already stated it appears that the animal and\r\nvegetable relics found in the Polar regions, imbedded in strata\r\ndeposited in widely separated geological eras, uniformly testify that a\r\nwarm climate has in former times prevailed over the whole globe. From\r\npalaeontological science no support can be obtained for the assumption\r\nof a periodical alternation of warm and cold climates on the surface of\r\nthe earth.\"[71]\r\n\r\nAnd now we have the equally positive language of A. R. Wallace:\r\n\r\n\"It is quite impossible to ignore or evade the force of the testimony as\r\nto the continuous warm climate of the North Temperate and Polar Zones\r\n=throughout Tertiary times=. The evidence extends over a vast area both\r\nin space and time, it is derived from the work of the most competent\r\nliving geologists, and it is absolutely consistent in its general\r\ntendency ... Whether in Miocene, Upper or Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic,\r\nTriassic, Carboniferous or Silurian times, and in all the numerous\r\nlocalities extending over more than half the Polar regions, we find =one\r\nuniform climatic aspect of the fossils=.\"[72]\r\n\r\nOf course in all this I am taking the various kinds of fossils in the\r\ntraditional chronological order. But I shall presently show on the best\r\nof authority that Man existed in \"Pliocene\" or perhaps \"Miocene times,\"\r\nand in view of such an admission we have, even from the standpoint of\r\ncurrent theory, a vital, personal interest in this question of climate.\r\nLet us take, then, the following from James Geikie, the great champion\r\nof the Glacial theory, on the climate of the Arctic regions at this part\r\nof the =human epoch=:\r\n\r\n\"Miocene deposits occur in Greenland, Iceland, Spitzbergen, and at other\r\nplaces within the Arctic Circle. The beds contain a similar (similar to\r\nthe \"most luxuriant vegetation\" of Switzerland) assemblage of\r\nplant-remains; the palm-trees, however, being wanting. It is certainly\r\nwonderful that within so recent a period as the Miocene, a climate\r\nexisted within the Arctic regions so mild and genial as to nourish there\r\nbeeches, oaks, planes, poplars, walnuts, limes, magnolias, hazel, holly,\r\nblackthorn, logwood, hawthorn, ivy, vines, and many evergreens, besides\r\nnumerous conifers, among which was the sequoia, allied to the gigantic\r\n_Wellingtonia_ of California. This ancient vegetation has been traced up\r\nto within eleven degrees of the Pole.\"[73]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dana and other American geologists the \"Glacial Period\" is\r\nonly a variation intervening between the warm Tertiary and the equally\r\nwarm \"Champlain Period,\" and it was during the latter that the mammoth,\r\nmastodon, etc., roamed over Europe, Asia, and America. Of the climate\r\nthen indicated, when all acknowledge that Man was in existence, this\r\nauthor says:\r\n\r\n\"The genial climate that followed the Glacial appears to have been\r\nmarvelously genial to the species, =and alike for all the continents,\r\nAustralia included=. The kinds that continued into modern time became\r\ndwindled in the change wherever found over the globe, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that genial climates are still to be found over large\r\nregions.\"[74]\r\n\r\nIn his \"Geological Story Briefly Told,\" he uses even stronger language:\r\n\r\n\"The brute mammals reached their maximum in numbers and size during the\r\nwarm Champlain Period, and many species lived then which have since\r\nbecome extinct. Those of Europe and Britain were largely warm-climate\r\nspecies, such as are now confined to warm temperate and tropical\r\nregions; and only in a warm period like the Champlain could they have\r\nthrived and attained their gigantic size. The great abundance of their\r\nremains and their condition show that the climate and food were all the\r\nanimals could have desired. They were masters of their wanderings, and\r\nhad their choice of the best.\"[75]\r\n\r\n\"The genial climate of the Champlain period was _abruptly_ (italics\r\nDana's) terminated. For carcasses of the Siberian elephants were frozen\r\nso suddenly and so completely at the change, that the flesh has remained\r\nuntainted.\" (Id. p. 230.)\r\n\r\nI quite agree with this author that the evidence is conclusive as to the\r\nclimate and food being \"all the animals could have desired,\" and that\r\nthey must have \"had their choice of the best.\" But it seems to me that\r\nin following out their theory these authors have not left the poor\r\ncreatures very much to choose from. For as the inevitable result of\r\ntheir theory in arranging the plants as well as the animals in\r\nchronological order according to the percentages of living and extinct\r\nforms, they have already disposed of, and consigned to the \"early\"\r\nTertiaries, etc., all the probable vegetation on which these animals\r\nlived, and thus have nothing left on which to feed the horse and bison,\r\nrhinoceros and elephant, etc., away within the Arctic Circle, except the\r\nfew miserable shrubs and lichens which now survive there.\r\n\r\nBut this strange, inconsistent notion of Dana's that the so-called\r\nGlacial phenomena lie in between the warm Tertiary and the equally warm\r\n\"Champlain period,\" is easily understood as the survival of the notion,\r\nso tenaciously held even later than the middle decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, that Man was =not= a witness of any of the great geological\r\nchanges. When the evidence became overwhelming that Man lived while the\r\nsemi-tropical animals roamed over England, the \"Glacial period\" still\r\nremained as a sort of buffer against the dangerous possibility of\r\nextending the =human= period back any further. I am not aware that this\r\nvenerable scientist ever became quite reconciled to the idea of\r\n\"Tertiary Man,\" though in his \"Manual\" he mentions a few evidences in\r\nfavor of this now almost universally accepted opinion.\r\n\r\nAs for the real teachings of the Drift phenomena there is no need of\r\nexplanation here. At the very most they are confined to a quite limited\r\npart of the northern hemisphere, there being no trace of them in Alaska,\r\nnor on the plains of Siberia, where now almost eternal frosts\r\nprevail.[76] In fact they are practically confined between the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Missouri River on the west, and the Ural Mountains on\r\nthe east; and with a little common sense infused into the foundation\r\nprinciples of the science we will cease to be tormented with a \"Glacial\r\nNightmare.\" Much of the Drift phenomena with the raised beaches are\r\ncertainly =later= events than most of the other geological work, but are\r\ninseparably connected with the general problem in their explanation.\r\nEven from the ordinary standpoint, I am not aware that the elaborate\r\nargument of Howorth has even been satisfactorily answered. Indeed, I\r\nfeel almost like saying that this writer's various contributions to the\r\ncause of inductive geology mark the beginning of the dawn.\r\n\r\nHence it may suffice here to merely call attention to the great\r\nsimplicity introduced into this vast complexity of the glacialists, by\r\nthe positive assurance of this author that the \"Drift period\" and the\r\nPleistocene =end together=, and join onto the modern; or perhaps I ought\r\nrather to say that the so-called Glacial phenomena lie in between the\r\ntrue fossil world and our modern one.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, in regard to the Pleistocene mammals, the view is now generally\r\naccepted that, in every place where they have been found in a\r\ncontemporary bed, that bed underlies the till, and is therefore\r\npre-glacial. As in other places, so here (Scotland), teeth and bones of\r\nmammals have occurred in the clay itself; but in all such cases they\r\noccur sporadically and as boulders. As Mr. James Geikie says, 'They\r\nalmost invariably afford marks of having been subjected to the same\r\naction as the stones and boulders by which they are surrounded; that is\r\nto say, they are rubbed, ground, striated, and smoothed.'\"[77]\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\"=The Pleistocene fauna, so far as I know, came to an end with the\r\nso-called Glacial age.=\" (Id. p. 463.)\r\n\r\nFrom a recent notice in _Nature_[78] it would seem that even Dr. H.\r\nWoodward, of the British Museum, supports this general view in his\r\n\"Table of British Strata,\" by the statement that the glacial deposits\r\ncontain =only derived fossils=.\r\n\r\nBut this is such a decided simplification of the problem of climate that\r\nI am utterly at a loss to understand how any one can still cling to the\r\ncomplex and highly artificial arrangement of numerous \"interglacial\"\r\nperiods, to account for a few bones of mammals or a few pockets of\r\nlignite; and how they can even place between the \"Glacial period\" and\r\nour times the \"genial Champlain period,\" with it, as Dana says,\r\n\"=abruptly terminated=,\" and becoming \"=suddenly= extreme as of a single\r\nwinter's night.\" Howorth, in the latter part of the chapter already\r\nquoted from (pp. 460-478), gives a good review of this subject of\r\nintermittent climates, and strongly supports his contention that the\r\n=stratigraphical evidence= all points to the fact that the Pleistocene\r\nforms are always older than the Drift-beds, and where the flora and\r\nfauna of the Pleistocene occur in the Drift, they do so only as\r\nboulders; that, in fact, as he says in his Preface, \"The Pleistocene\r\nFlood ... =forms a great dividing line= in the superficial deposits,\"\r\nseparating the true fossil world from the modern.\r\n\r\nI have hardly the space to repeat here my argument about the extremely\r\nfanciful way in which geologists classify the various members of the\r\nTertiary group and the Pleistocene. And yet I must say a few words. I\r\nhave tried to show the utter nonsense of the common custom of\r\nclassifying these beds according to the percentage of living and extinct\r\nforms which they contain, when the real fact is that the number and\r\nkinds of the ancient life-forms which have survived into the modern era\r\nis a purely fortuitous circumstance, being limited solely to those lucky\r\nones which could stand the radical change from a tepid water or a genial\r\nair to the ice and frosts which they now experience, to mention only one\r\ncircumstance of that cosmic convulsion which we now know to have really\r\nintervened between that ancient world and our own. =YET IT IS ON SUCH\r\nEVIDENCE ONLY= that these Pleistocene forms are separated from the\r\nTertiaries, or that the Tertiaries themselves are classified off--at\r\nleast as far as the invertebrates and the plants are concerned. No one\r\nclaims that the so-called Glacial beds can be sharply distinguished from\r\nother deposits on purely mechanical make-up. Indeed, I am strongly of\r\nthe opinion that very many Archaean soils, totally unfossiliferous\r\nthemselves, and resting on unfossiliferous rocks, have been assigned to\r\nthe \"Glacial age,\" merely because their discoverers did not know what\r\nelse to do with them. When beds contain fossils, the latter are the one\r\nand only guide in determining age; but in view of the purely arbitrary\r\ncharacter of this method of classifying off the Tertiary and\r\npost-Tertiary rocks, I do not see where we are going to =draw the line=\r\nwhen we once admit that the post-Tertiary beds contain only \"derived\r\nfossils.\" It seems to me truly astonishing that shrewd reasoners, like\r\nHoworth and Dr. Woodward, have not seen the dangerous character of this\r\nprecedent which they have admitted. For with that marvelous climate of\r\nall geological time continuing right up to that fatal day when it was\r\n\"abruptly terminated,\" and the mammoth and his fellows were caught in\r\nthe merciless frosts which now hold them, the percentage of all the\r\nlucky forms of life, plants, invertebrates, or mammals, which could\r\nstand such a change and \"persist\" into our modern world, must be\r\n=utterly nonsensical as a test of age= even from their standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn resuming the main argument of this chapter, I need only summarize by\r\nsaying that the evidence is conclusive that all geological time down to\r\nthis sharp \"dividing line\" was characterized by a surprisingly mild and\r\nuniform climate over all the earth. The modern period is characterized\r\nby terrific extremes of heat and cold; and now little or nothing can\r\nexist where previously plant and animal life flourished in profusion.\r\n\r\nThis radical and world-wide change in climate, therefore, demands ample\r\nconsideration when seeking a true induction as to the past of our globe.\r\nThat it was no gradual or secular affair, but that the climate \"became\r\n=suddenly= extreme as of a single winter's night,\" the Siberian\r\n\"mummies\" are unanswerable arguments. =That it occurred within the human\r\nepoch= all are now agreed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] \"The Glacial Nightmare and the Flood,\" pp. 426-479.\r\n\r\n[69] \"Manual,\" pp. 484, 524-5.\r\n\r\n[70] Op. cit., pp. 434-5.\r\n\r\n[71] Id., p. 45.\r\n\r\n[72] \"Island Life,\" pp. 182, 195-6; \"Nightmare,\" pp. 455-6.\r\n\r\n[73] \"Historical Geology,\" p. 76.\r\n\r\n[74] \"Manual,\" p. 997.\r\n\r\n[75] p. 225, Edition of 1875.\r\n\r\n[76] See Dana's \"Manual,\" pp. 945, 977; also \"The Glacial Nightmare,\"\r\n     pp. 45-2, 511, etc.\r\n\r\n[77] \"Great Ice Age,\" p. 129; \"Nightmare,\" p. 473.\r\n\r\n[78] See _Nature_ April 11, 1901, p. 560.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDEGENERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another great general fact about the fossil world which seems\r\nto be a natural corollary from the one already given about climate.\r\n\r\nIt is this:\r\n\r\n=The fossils, regarded as a whole, invariably supply us with types\r\nlarger of their kind and better developed in every way than their\r\nnearest modern representatives, whether of plants or animals.=\r\n\r\nThis fact also is so well known that it needs no proof. Through the\r\nwhole range of geological literature I do not know of a word of dissent\r\nfrom this general fact by any writer whatever. Proof therefore is not\r\nnecessary, though a brief review of a little of the evidence may refresh\r\nour memories.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the Cambrian, Dana says:\r\n\r\n\"The Pteropods, among Mollusks, were much larger than the modern species\r\nof the tribe. The Trilobites even of the Lower Cambrian comprise species\r\nas large as living Crustaceans. The Ostrapods are generally larger than\r\nthose of recent times.\"[79]\r\n\r\nAgain, in speaking of the general character of the Cambrian fossils, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"The types of the early Cambrian are mostly identical with those now\r\nrepresented in existing seas, and although inferior in general as to\r\ngrade [in the \"Phylogenic series\"], they bear no marks of imperfect or\r\nstunted growth from unfit or foul surroundings.\" (p. 485.)\r\n\r\nThe well known Mollusk, _Maclurea magna_, which is so enormously\r\nabundant in the Silurian, is often eight inches in diameter, and the\r\nastounding Cephalopod genus, _Endoceras_, consisting of twenty species,\r\nfound only in two divisions of the Lower Silurian, has left shells over\r\na foot in diameter, and ten or twelve feet long!\r\n\r\nOf the fishes of the Devonian we have, among other remarks of a similar\r\ncharacter, the following:\r\n\r\n\"The Dipnoans, or 'Lung-fishes,' were represented by gigantic species\r\ncalled by Newberry _Dinichthys_ and _Titanichthys_, from their size and\r\nformidable dental armature.... A still larger species is the\r\n_Titanichthys clarki_ of Newberry, in which the head was four feet or\r\nmore broad, the lower jaw a yard long. This jaw was shaped posteriorly\r\nlike an oar blade, and anteriorly was turned upward like a sled\r\nrunner.\"[80]\r\n\r\nOne of the ancient Eurypterids from the Old Red Sandstone of Europe has\r\na length of six feet, which is more than three times that of any\r\nCrustacean now living. While a gigantic Isopod Crustacean from the same\r\nstrata had a leg the basal joint of which was three inches long, and\r\nthree-quarters of an inch through, which is larger than the whole body\r\nof any modern species.\r\n\r\nThe ancient \"Horse-tails,\" \"Ground-pines,\" Ferns and Cycads were trees\r\nfrom 30 to 90 feet high, and their carbonized stems and leaves make up\r\nmany of our largest and best beds of coal. Compared with them the modern\r\nrepresentatives are mere herbs or shrubbery.\r\n\r\nOf the gigantic insects of the Devonian and Carboniferous beds we might\r\nmake similar remarks. Some of the ancient locusts had an expanse of wing\r\nof over seven inches; while many of the ancient Dragon-flies had bodies\r\nfrom a foot to sixteen inches long, with wings a foot long and over two\r\nfeet in spread from tip to tip.\r\n\r\nHere is James Geikie's summary of the leading types of the Palaeozoic:\r\n\r\n\"Many Palaeozoic species were characterized by their large size as\r\ncompared with species of the same groups that belong to later times.\r\nThus, some Trilobites and other Crustaceans were larger than any modern\r\nspecies of Crustaceans. The Palaeozoic Amphibians also much exceeded in\r\nsize any living members of their class. Again, the modern club-mosses,\r\nwhich are insignificant plants, either trailing on the ground or never\r\nreaching more than two feet in height, were represented by great\r\nlepidodendroid trees.\"\r\n\r\nSternberg, in speaking of some of the frogs which he found in the\r\nPermian of Texas, says:\r\n\r\n\"I found several skulls that measured over a foot from the end of the\r\nchin to the distal point of the horns.... I think when alive the frog\r\nmust have been six feet long.\"[81]\r\n\r\nHe mentions another specimen which was \"about 10 feet long,\" the head of\r\nwhich was \"about 20 inches in length,\" with jaws \"more powerful than\r\nthose of an ox.\"\r\n\r\nOf the monstrous Dinosaurs of the Mesozoic rocks one hardly needs to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"They were the most gigantic of terrestrial animals, in some cases\r\nreaching a length of 70 or 80 feet, while at the same time they had a\r\nheight of body and massiveness of limb that, without evidence from the\r\nbones, would have been thought too great for muscle to move.\"[82]\r\n\r\nThey abound in both the Old and the New World.\r\n\r\nOf the gigantic Mammals of the Tertiary beds of the Western States, it\r\nwould also be superfluous to speak; their gigantic size is known by\r\nevery high school pupil, or every one who has visited any important\r\nmuseum in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps be reminded again that all the species of these \"older\"\r\nrocks are extinct species. I have already suggested the grave doubts on\r\nthis point, regarding the great mass of the lower forms of life, plant\r\nand animal; but we will let that pass. But let us take some of the\r\n\"late\" Tertiary and Pleistocene mammals, which cannot be distinguished\r\nfrom living species, and how do we fare? It is the same old story; the\r\nmoderns are degenerate dwarfs.\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus (_H. major_) is a good one to start with, for Flower\r\nand Lydekker[83] say that it \"cannot be specifically distinguished from\r\n_H. amphibius_\" of Africa. This gigantic brute used to live in the\r\nrivers of England and Western Europe. The text-books generally say in\r\n\"Pliocene times,\" because, I suppose, no one has the courage to suggest\r\nthat it lived under the ice of the \"Glacial period.\" We are always\r\npointed to the wool on the rhinoceros and the mammoth as indicating a\r\nsomewhat cool climate, but the well known amphibious habits of the\r\nhippopotamus cannot be so easily disposed of. But if, as I believe, this\r\nworld never saw a foot of ice at the sea level till the end of the\r\n\"Pleistocene period,\" to speak after the current manner, the problem\r\nbecomes very simple. In that case the time of the Hippopotamus in\r\nEngland was neither earlier nor later than that of the palms and acacias\r\nof the \"early\" Tertiary or Mesozoic rocks, or than that of the mammoth,\r\nlion, and hyena of the Pleistocene. There is as we now know absolutely\r\nnothing but an out-of-date hypothesis to indicate that they did not all\r\nlive there together. We may, if we choose, try to dovetail those\r\nconditions into the present on the basis of uniformity and slow secular\r\nchange, by assuming a few million years for the process, but there is\r\nneither a particle of evidence nor of probability that the hippopotamus\r\nwas not contemporary alike with the palms of the Eocene and the\r\nelephants and lions of the post-Tertiary.\r\n\r\nAs for the mammoth itself, which Flower and Lydekker have intimated may\r\nturn out identical with _E. Columbi_ and _E. armeniacus_, and thus the\r\ndirect ancestor of the modern Asiatic elephant (_E. indicus_), some have\r\nargued that its average size was not greater than that of the existing\r\nspecies of India and Africa. But Nicholson says that it was:\r\n\r\n\"... considerably larger than the largest of living elephants, the\r\nskeleton being over sixteen feet in length, exclusive of the tusks, and\r\nover nine feet in height.\"[84]\r\n\r\nDana is equally positive:\r\n\r\n\"The species was over twice the weight of the largest modern elephant,\r\nand nearly a third taller.\"[85]\r\n\r\nThe upper incisors or tusks were very much longer than in the modern\r\nspecies, being from ten to twelve feet long, and sometimes curved up and\r\nback so as to form an almost complete circle. As these tusks continue to\r\ngrow throughout life, their enormous length is, I take it, a proof of\r\nmuch greater longevity and thus of greater vitality than in the cases of\r\nthe modern species. The latter is simply a degenerate.\r\n\r\nAnd so I might go on with the Edentates, the Ungulates, the Rodents, the\r\nCarnivores, etc., for the same thing must be said of all.\r\n\r\nAs Sir William Dawson[86] remarks:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is more evident in the history of fossil animals and plants of\r\npast geological ages than that =persistence or degeneracy are the rule=\r\nrather than the exception.... We may almost say that all things left\r\nto themselves =tend to degenerate=, and only a new breathing of the\r\nAlmighty Spirit can start them again on the path of advancement.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the long popular views of Cuvier, every modern scientist\r\nadmits that the great lion and hyena of the Pleistocene are identical\r\nwith the living species of Africa. Many say the same thing of the fossil\r\nbear as compared with the modern brown bear and the grizzly, though, as\r\nDana remarks of all three, lion, hyena, and bear, \"these modern kinds\r\nare dwarfs in comparison.\"\r\n\r\nI quote again from Dana:\r\n\r\n\"Thus the brute races of the Middle Quaternary on all the continents\r\nexceeded the moderns greatly in magnitude. Why, no one has\r\nexplained.\"[87]\r\n\r\nThis was in 1875. In the last edition of his \"Manual,\" published\r\nshortly after his death, he has this to say in addition:\r\n\r\n\"A species thrives best in the region of fittest climate. =In the\r\nPleistocene, the fittest climate was universal.= Geologists have\r\nattributed the extinction of most of the species and the dwindling of\r\nothers to the cold of the Reindeer epoch. It is the only explanation yet\r\nfound, though seemingly insufficient for the Americas.\" (p. 1016.)\r\n\r\nHowever, since the discovery of the pictures of the reindeer and the\r\nmammoth drawn and even painted =side by side= on the caverns of Southern\r\nFrance, undoubtedly from life and by the same artist, we do not hear so\r\nmuch about the \"Reindeer epoch,\" and the \"Mammoth epoch.\" A little\r\nthought should have suggested long ago that it was more reasonable to\r\nsuppose the reindeer, glutton, musk-ox, etc., to have been originally\r\nadapted to the high mountains and table lands of that ancient world,\r\nthan to imagine all the fauna careering up and down over continents and\r\nacross seas like a lot of crazy Scandinavian lemmings, as the migration\r\ntheory involved. But most geologists seem never to have had any use for\r\nmountains or plateaus, except to breed glaciers and continental\r\nice-sheets. But the only point which I wish to insist upon here is that\r\nthe cause, =whatever it was=, that made such a zoological break at the\r\n\"close\" of the Pleistocene, and which compelled the shivering,\r\ndegenerate survivors, that could not stand the new extremes of frost and\r\nsnow, to shift to the Tropics--this cause was certainly competent to do\r\na good deal more work in the way of \"extinction\" or \"dwindling\" of\r\nspecies than the uniformitarians have generally given it credit for.\r\n\r\nAnd in summing up this matter regarding the size and physical\r\ndevelopment of species, we must confess that we find in geology no\r\nindication of inherent progress upward. Variation there is and variation\r\nthere has been, even \"mutations\" and \"saltations,\" but with one voice do\r\nthe rocks testify that the general results of such variation have not\r\nbeen upward. Rather must we confess as a great biological law, that\r\n=degeneration has marked the history of every living form=.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] \"Manual,\" p. 487.\r\n\r\n[80] pp. 618-9.\r\n\r\n[81] _Pop.

It is this:\r\n\r\n=Man himself, to say nothing of numerous living animals and plants, must\r\nhave witnessed something of the nature of a cosmic convulsion--how much\r\nit is the object of our search to find out.= Even according to the\r\nordinary text-books, he must have seen the uplifting of the greater part\r\nof the mountain chains of the world; while he certainly lived in\r\nconditions of climate, and of land and water distribution, together with\r\nplant and animal surroundings, which preclude the possibility of\r\ndovetailing those conditions into the present order of things on any\r\nbasis of uniformity.\r\n\r\nBy this proposition I simply mean that Man must have witnessed a cosmic\r\ngeological catastrophe of some character and of some dimensions--the\r\ntrue nature and probable limits of this catastrophe ought to be the\r\nchief point of all geological inquiry. But instead of this method,\r\ninstead of finding out whether our present world was ever a witness of\r\nsuch an event, the founders of the science began at the little end of an\r\nassumed succession of life (involving a preposterous supernatural\r\nknowledge of the past), and gradually worked up a habit of explaining\r\neverything in terms of Uniformity long decades before they would\r\nacknowledge that Man or the present order of things had anything to do\r\nwith this fossil world. The evidence on this latter point finally became\r\noverwhelming; but with their habit of Uniformity well mastered, and\r\ntheir long, single file of life succession all tabulated off and\r\ninfallibly fixed, modern geologists have hitherto refused to look at the\r\nwhole science from this new point of view, or to reconstruct geological\r\ntheory if need be in accordance with a true modern induction.\r\n\r\nAnd in this proposition the reader will understand that I believe in\r\nwhat is called \"Tertiary man.\" I am aware that a few scientists still\r\ncontest this view, but the evidence (from the standpoint of current\r\ntheory) seems to me to be overwhelmingly against them. But in this fact,\r\nif it be a fact, that Man lived under the wholly strange and different\r\nconditions of \"Pliocene\" or perhaps \"Miocene times,\" is =THE VERY\r\nSTRONGEST POSSIBLE ARGUMENT= that I can conceive of for the necessity of\r\na complete reconstruction of geological theory--I mean, of course, apart\r\naltogether from the preposterous way in which the life succession was\r\nassumed and built up and then treated as an actual fact. It was when\r\nthis grim fact of Man's inseparable connection with the fossil world was\r\nborne in upon me, that I began to realize the possibility and imperative\r\nnecessity of reconstructing the science on a truly inductive basis.\r\n\r\nI shall not undertake to give a complete up-to-date argument for\r\n\"Miocene\" or even \"Pliocene Man.\" The subject is still under discussion\r\nas to =just how far back= along this thin line of receding life forms\r\nMan actually did live, and from the peculiar methods now in vogue which\r\nare so wholly subjective in character, it would seem to be capable of\r\nsettlement in almost any way one chooses. However, whole volumes are\r\nbeing written on the subject, and the end is not yet. But there is no\r\ndenying that human remains have frequently been found in strata which,\r\nbut for their presence, would have been assigned a place far back in\r\n\"Tertiary time.\" The existence of strong evidence for \"Tertiary Man\" no\r\none would think of denying.\r\n\r\nIn all this, of course, I am considering the question from the common\r\nuniformitarian standpoint. But why should it be necessary for us to\r\npositively settle the question as to just how far back in geological\r\ntime Man actually did live? For those who have attentively read my\r\nstatement of the unscientific methods of classifying these Tertiary and\r\npost-Tertiary beds--or all the others for that matter--I need not here\r\nadd any further argument if the accepted succession of life is, to put\r\nit as mildly as possible, not quite a scientific certainty; if the\r\ntime-honored custom of classifying these so-called \"superficial\" beds by\r\ntheir relative percentages of extinct and living forms rests under a\r\nshadow of suspicion as to its scientific accuracy; if, above all, we do\r\nnot at the beginning prejudice the whole case by the assumption of\r\nuniformity, =what need is there of determining whether \"Pliocene\" or\r\n\"Miocene\" shells are found with these fossil human remains?=\r\n\r\nThat Man lived in Western Europe contemporary with those giants of the\r\nprime, the elephant and the musk-ox, the rhinoceros and the reindeer,\r\nthe lion, the Cape hyena, and the hippopotamus, at which time a very\r\ndifferent distribution of land and water prevailed over these parts,\r\nwith a radically different mantle of climate spread over all, no one\r\nwill deny for a moment. Such facts are now found in the primary\r\ntext-books for our children in the public schools.\r\n\r\nBut since geologists still classify the rocks as they do, and give a\r\ntime value to percentages of extinct and living species of marine\r\nshells, etc., we are in a measure compelled to take the matter where we\r\nfind it, and enquire how far back in geological time, i.e., among what\r\nkinds of fossils, are human remains found?\r\n\r\nOne of the best popular works on the subject that I know of is \"The\r\nMeeting-Place of Geology and History,\" (1894) by Sir J. W. Dawson;\r\nthough, like all other works of its kind written from the religious\r\nstandpoint, it endeavors as far as possible to minimize the evidence in\r\nsupport of Man's geological antiquity.\r\n\r\nThis author thinks that Dr. Mourlan, of Belgium, has \"established the\r\nstrongest case yet on record for the existence of Tertiary Man.\" (p.\r\n30.) It is that of some worked flints and broken bones of animals\r\n\"imbedded in sands derived from Eocene and Pliocene beds, and supposed\r\nto have been remanie by wind action.\" Prestwich[88] has brought forward\r\nsimilar facts; and though the evidence in favor of the genuine\r\ngeological character of these remains seems to me little if any better\r\nthan that from the auriferous gravels of California, I am willing to\r\n=take them as reported=.\r\n\r\nDawson speaks of the nearly entire human skeleton described by\r\nQuatrefages from the Lower Pliocene beds of Castelnedolo, near Brescia,\r\nand only answers it with a sarcastic remark about the well developed\r\nskull of this ancient man.\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately the skull of the only perfect skeleton is said to have\r\nbeen of fair proportions and superior to those of the ruder types of\r\npost-Glacial men. This has cast a shade of suspicion on the discovery,\r\nespecially on the part of evolutionists, who think it is not in\r\naccordance with theory that man should retrograde between the Pliocene\r\nand the early modern period instead of advancing.\"[89]\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the following about the Miocene:\r\n\r\n\"There are, however, in France two localities (Puy, Courney and Thenay),\r\none in the Upper and the other in the Middle Miocene, which have\r\nafforded what are supposed to be worked flints.\"\r\n\r\nHe adds that \"The geological age of the deposits seems in both cases\r\nbeyond question;\" but contents himself with a derisive answer about\r\nthese chipped flints being possibly \"the handiwork of Miocene apes.\"\r\n\r\nThis language, coming from such a source, would seem as good evidence as\r\nis needed to prove that Man was contemporary with, and that his remains\r\nare now found among the fossils of the Middle Miocene. For it must be\r\nremembered that these are reluctant admissions drawn from this\r\nillustrious scientist, who was one of the last champions of the old\r\nideas about the \"recent\" origin of Man. As Pres. Asa Mahan of Cornell\r\nhas said, \"Admissions in favor of truth from the ranks of its enemies\r\nconstitute the highest kind of evidence.\" At any rate, I shall treat\r\nthis point as already proved, =for whether this particular instance is\r\naccepted or not, practically all modern writers admit the fact of\r\n\"Middle Tertiary Man.\"=\r\n\r\nI have already alluded to the recently discovered paintings on the cave\r\nwalls of Southern France, where reindeer, aurochs, horses and mammoths\r\nhave been reproduced with striking accuracy and skill, and of such an\r\nage that they have in places been covered by stalactites over two inches\r\nin thickness. The Marquis De Nadaillac,[90] who has given the best\r\ndescription of these interesting antiquities that I have been able to\r\nsee, remarks that \"the drawing is wonderful,\" and that \"we are justly\r\nastonished to find such artistic performances in times so distant from\r\nours, and in which we did not suppose a like civilization.\"\r\n\r\nI have not seen the geological date to which these remains have been\r\nassigned, but doubtless it is the very \"latest\" part of the\r\nPleistocene--they show far too high a development for \"Miocene\" or even\r\n\"Pliocene times.\" But I should like to be shown some good and sufficient\r\nreason for saying that these men are not just as likely to have been\r\ncontemporary with the Middle Tertiary fauna and flora as any others.\r\n=Some men were as commonly admitted.= And in the name of sacred common\r\nsense, if the human period is thus elastic enough to stretch out over\r\nthe Pleistocene, the Pliocene, and clear back to the \"Middle Miocene,\"\r\n=why can't we do the same for all of man's strange companions=, the\r\nmammoth and the Cape hyena, the reindeer and the hippopotamus, the lion\r\nand the musk-ox, etc.? The usual sneers about it being impossible for\r\nthis apparently incongruous mixture to live side by side in the same\r\ndistrict must now cease. They certainly did live side by side, as is\r\nshown by these companion pictures of the mammoth and the reindeer in the\r\nvery southern part of sunny France, to say nothing of the numerous cases\r\nwhere the bones of the above mentioned animals are all mixed together\r\nindiscriminately. How is it unreasonable to suppose that these\r\nelephants, lions and hippopotami lived beneath the \"early\" Tertiary\r\npalms, cinnamons, and mimosas of the lower elevations, while the\r\nreindeer, musk-ox and glutton lived beneath the maples, birches and\r\nbeeches of the high mountain sides? Some such conditions must have\r\nexisted, for that magnificent world, whose ruins we now find buried\r\nbeneath our feet, was a =homogeneous and harmonious= unit in its plant\r\nand animal life, in spite of the fables upon which we have so long been\r\nfed in the name of geological science. Things which are equal to the\r\nsame thing must be equal to one another; hence the plants and animals\r\nwhich were contemporary with the same creature (Man) must have been\r\n=contemporary with each other=; and hence there is absolutely nothing to\r\nforbid the idea that Man and his Pleistocene companions were really\r\ncontemporary with the flora and fauna of the Middle Tertiary.\r\n\r\nHence we may now proceed to inquire what geological changes have\r\noccurred since the \"Middle of the Miocene,\" according to the accepted\r\nteachings of geology.\r\n\r\nOur first point must be that of climate, and I have already given\r\nabundant evidence to show that at that \"time\" an abundant warm-climate\r\nvegetation mantled all the Arctic regions. As already quoted from\r\nWallace, throughout the whole Arctic regions, and during the whole of\r\ngeological time, \"we find one uniform climatic aspect of the fossils,\"\r\nand \"It is quite impossible to ignore or evade the force of the\r\ntestimony as to the continuous warm climate of the North Temperate and\r\nPolar Zones throughout Tertiary times.\"\r\n\r\nThat this astonishingly mild and uniform climate prevailed over these\r\nregions until and during the time of the mammoth, we ought not to have a\r\nshadow of doubt. =What single bit of positive evidence is there to show\r\nthat it did not?= That he must have had some such vegetation on which to\r\nfeed is certain, and there is no proof of any previous interruption of\r\nthese conditions save a series of hypotheses. He and his fellows browsed\r\non semi-tropical and warm temperate plants far within the Arctic Circle,\r\nif there happened to be land there, doubtless over the very Pole itself;\r\nbut suddenly!! lo, something caught him with the grip of death--\r\n\r\n    \"And wrapped his corpse in winding-sheet of ice,\r\n    And sung the requiem of his shivering ghost.\"\r\n\r\nWho has not read of their untainted meat now making food for dogs and\r\nwolves? Their stomachs are well filled with undigested food, showing, as\r\none author remarks, that they \"were quietly feeding when the crisis\r\ncame.\" Dr. Hertz recently reported one not only with its stomach full of\r\nfood, but with its mouth full, too. No wonder that even an orthodox\r\ngeologist like Prof. Dana is compelled to say that these things prove\r\n\"that the cold finally became =suddenly= extreme, as of a single\r\nwinter's night, and knew no relenting afterward.\"\r\n\r\nHere then is one very notable geological event which has taken place\r\nwithin the human epoch, and the only thing of its kind of which geology\r\nhas an undeniable record, viz., a sudden and radical change in the\r\nearth's climate; =a cosmic affair, and not a local phenomenon=. I need\r\nnot here attempt to discuss the how of this world catastrophe as it must\r\nhave been, or the other changes inseparably involved. The fact itself is\r\nas certain as Man's own existence.\r\n\r\nThe next division of our subject, in further consideration of the\r\nchanges that have taken place since Man's existence, as stated at the\r\nbeginning of this chapter, relates to the changes of land and water\r\ndistribution since \"Middle Miocene times.\" And here again I shall try to\r\ntake the classification of these rocks just as I find them.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which impresses us is the extremely fragmentary\r\ndistribution of the Miocene and Pliocene beds. Not, however, that they\r\nare uncommon nor yet of small extent. On the contrary they are scattered\r\nover America and Eurasia--and all the rest of the globe for that\r\nmatter--like the spots on a leopard, or the warts on a toad's back, till\r\nit becomes one of the unsearchable mysteries of the science how these\r\ninnumerable patches can be got down under the ocean to receive their\r\nload of sediment, without deluging the surrounding regions in a similar\r\nmanner. But then, to be sure, fresh-water lakes will answer the same\r\npurpose, and are particularly indicated when the proportion of plants\r\nand terrestrial animals is =in excess= of the true marine fossils. And\r\nso enormous fresh-water basins are described here and there, with the\r\ngreat mammals crowding about their margins in their zeal to become\r\nfossilized, that the mountain tops may be saved from going under once\r\nmore--or perhaps I should say to enable the modern writers to get some\r\nof these strata puckered up to their full height before these \"late\"\r\nTertiary deposits were made. This mountain making business is another\r\naffair that geologists would like to have take place on the installment\r\nplan, but unfortunately it seems to have been nearly all postponed till\r\nthe very close of \"geological time.\" This arrangement of fresh-water\r\nlakes saves the central Rocky Mountain region from going down again\r\nbeneath the deep. But it cannot save the Alps, Juras and Appennines in\r\nEurope, nor parts of the Himalayas, and I know not what other mountains\r\nin Asia, nor the coast region of California and Oregon in America, to\r\nsay nothing of large parts of the Andes in South America, with regions\r\nin Africa and Australia.\r\n\r\nBut what is the use of trying to figure out the amount of our earth\r\nwhich has been under the ocean since \"Middle Tertiary times,\" and thus\r\nsince Man was upon it? To save the northern half of Europe with all of\r\nCanada from again going under at the close of the \"Tertiary period,\"\r\ngeologists have spread out their continental ice sheets, and have asked\r\nthem to do duty instead of water. But this is hardly sufficient, for the\r\n\"upper\" or \"later\" part of the so-called \"Glacial\" deposits are clearly\r\nstratified; and so they either invoke a \"=flood vast beyond\r\nconception=,\" as Dana does in America for the \"final event in the\r\nhistory of the glacier,\" or, as others prefer, the whole region is\r\nbaptized again. As Dawson says in his \"Meeting-Place of Geology and\r\nHistory,\" \"=No geological event is better established than the\r\npost-Pliocene submergence.=\"\r\n\r\nBut I must not weary the reader by dwelling on this monotonous\r\nrepetition of catastrophes--for must they not have been catastrophic if\r\nsuch ups and downs of whole continents are crowded within the human\r\nperiod? We may allow a number of thousands of years for Man's possible\r\nexistence, but Archaeology and History alike protest against the\r\n=millions= of years required to explain these continental oscillations\r\non any basis of uniformity. One such period of horror ought to be enough\r\nfor us, and to understand or explain it in a truly scientific manner, we\r\nmust with it correlate the sudden and world-wide change of climate\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nOne more point demands consideration ere we complete this subject of\r\nwhat Man has witnessed of geological change. For, according to current\r\ntheory =almost all the mountains have been either wholly formed or at\r\nleast completed within quite \"recent\" times=: indeed many of the\r\ngreatest mountain chains have been puckered up from the position of\r\nhorizontal strata wholly since \"Miocene times,\" which for us means since\r\nMan was upon the globe.\r\n\r\nThus Dana in speaking of the part of Western America which has been\r\nelevated since \"Miocene times,\" says that it--\r\n\r\n\"... probably included the whole of the Pacific mountain border, from\r\nthe line of the Mississippi Valley to the Pacific coast line and outside\r\nof this line for one or more scores of miles.\"[91]\r\n\r\nAnd he adds the significant words:\r\n\r\n\"Contemporaneously, similar movements were in progress over the other\r\ncontinents: along the Andes, affecting half, at least, of South America;\r\nthe Pyrenees, Carpathian Alps, and a large part of Europe; the Himalayas\r\nand much of Asia.\" (p. 365.)\r\n\r\nLet us now take a brief glance at a few of the details of what these\r\nmountains were thus doing while Man was living in semi-tropical England,\r\nor at least Western Europe.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of foreign examples of Tertiary mountain-making this author\r\ndevotes especial attention to the Alps and the Juras, for their\r\nstructure is better understood, having been more carefully studied. And\r\nof an example described by Heim, already spoken of, he says:\r\n\r\n\"One of the overthrust folds in the region has put the beds upside down\r\nover an area of 450 square miles. Fifty thousand feet of formations of\r\nthe Jurassic, Cretaceous, Eocene Tertiary and Miocene Tertiary, were\r\nupturned =at the close of the Miocene period=.\"[92]\r\n\r\nWith what a whack must this mighty mass of rocks have fallen on\r\nitself--miles in thickness, and turned \"upside down over an area of 450\r\nsquare miles\"!!!\r\n\r\nOf course I am here taking the record just as I find it, as I have\r\nalready discussed this matter of \"overthrust folds.\"\r\n\r\nI need not give further examples from the other great mountain ranges.\r\nTheir structure is not so well understood as that of the Alps, though\r\ndoubtless when examined they will be found just as \"young,\" and just as\r\nfull of astonishing mountain movements as those already examined. But\r\nthis much is already certain, that =practically over all the world the\r\nmountains were either completed or wholly raised from the sea level=\r\nduring \"late Tertiary\" and \"early Quaternary time.\" No wonder Dana says\r\nthat this fact \"is one of the most marvelous in geological history.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been thought incredible that the orographic climax should have\r\ncome =so near the end= of geological time, instead of in an early age\r\nwhen the crust had a plastic layer beneath, and was free to move; yet\r\n=the fact is beyond question=.\" (\"Manual,\" p. 1020.)\r\n\r\nI think I have now abundantly proved the various heads of the\r\nproposition with which I began this chapter, viz., that even from the\r\nstandpoint of the current theories:--[93]\r\n\r\n(1) Man must have seen the entire elevation or at least the completion\r\nof practically all the great mountains of the world, such as the\r\nRockies, Andes, Alps, Himalayas, etc.\r\n\r\n(2) The relative distribution of land and water surface has--since Man's\r\nadvent as commonly stated--changed completely. The land and water have\r\npractically changed places over the greater part of the globe.\r\n\r\n(3) Man lived while the Arctic regions had a mild soft climate, and he\r\nlived to see these conditions so suddenly changed that some of his dumb\r\nbrute companions were caught in the waters and frozen so speedily that\r\ntheir flesh has remained untainted. Other considerations show this\r\nchange of climate to have affected the whole globe.\r\n\r\nThe lesson to be drawn from this as the last fact in the line of\r\ncumulative evidence here presented, will be considered in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] \"Controverted Questions of Geology,\" Article III., 1895.\r\n\r\n[89] \"Meeting-Place,\" pp. 28, 29.\r\n\r\n[90] _Pop. Sc. News_, Feb. 1902.\r\n\r\n[91] \"Manual,\" p. 364.\r\n\r\n[92] p. 367.\r\n\r\n[93] (Note. In this discussion I have purposely ignored the various\r\n     instances where human remains have been reported from deposits of\r\n     even greater \"antiquity\" than the Middle Tertiaries.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nINDUCTIVE METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the First Part of this book I tried to examine into the facts and\r\nmethods which are commonly supposed to prove that there has been a\r\nsuccession of life on the globe. We found that this life succession\r\ntheory has not a single fact to support it; that it is not the result of\r\nscientific research, but wholly the product of an inventive imagination;\r\nthat no one kind of fossil has even been proved or can be proved to be\r\nintrinsically older than another, or than Man himself; and hence that a\r\ncomplete reconstruction of geological theory is imperatively demanded by\r\nour modern knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part I have brought out the following additional facts:\r\n\r\n1. The abnormal character of much of the fossiliferous deposits.\r\n\r\n2. A radical and world-wide change of climate.\r\n\r\n3. The marked degeneration in passing from the fossil world to the\r\nmodern one.\r\n\r\n4. The fact that the human race, to say nothing of a vast number of\r\nliving species of plants and animals, has participated in some of the\r\ngreatest of the geological changes--we really know not how to limit the\r\nnumber or character of these changes.\r\n\r\nSurely a true spirit of scientific investigation would now begin to\r\ninquire, =How did these changes take place?= Discarding the use of\r\nstronger language, it is at least utterly unscientific to begin\r\nsomewhere at the vanishing point of a past eternity and formulate our\r\npretty theories as to how this deposit was made, and how that was laid\r\ndown, and the exact order in which they all occurred; while these\r\n\"recent\" deposits, in which our race and the plants and animals living\r\nabout us are acknowledged to be concerned, are left over till the last,\r\nand we then find that they admit of absolutely no explanation. We\r\nourselves, to say nothing of thousands of living species of plants and\r\nanimals, have participated in some of the very greatest of the\r\ngeological changes--we know not how many or how great. =These things\r\nmust be first explained.= Has anything happened to our world that will\r\nexplain them? Are there known forces and changes now in operation which,\r\ngranting time enough, will amply and sufficiently explain these facts,\r\nas simply one in kind with those of the present day?\r\n\r\nTo this last question we must admit that our historic experience,\r\nprolonged over several thousand years, utters a thundering =NO!=\r\nVolcanoes are every now and then breaking forth; but volcanoes and\r\nmountain ranges have nothing in common with one another as to structure\r\nand origin. No one claims that a single mountain flexure is now being\r\nformed or has been formed within the historic period. There are indeed\r\n\"creeps\" in the rocks in certain places, but these are not such as to\r\ncontribute to the height of the mountains in which they occur, but\r\nrather the reverse. Sudden changes of level within small areas have\r\noccurred, but neither in extent nor in kind do they furnish any key as\r\nto past changes of level; while the so-called \"secular\" changes are so\r\nmicroscopic in extent and so doubtful in character that they are utterly\r\nunworthy of consideration in view of the stupendous problems which we\r\nare trying to explain. The well-known work of Eduard Suess is a standing\r\nprotest that such geological chances are =not now in progress=; for, in\r\nspeaking of how the land and ocean have exchanged places in the past,\r\nZittel represents him as teaching that their \"cause of origin until now\r\n=has not yet been discovered=.\"[94]\r\n\r\nOr, to quote the expressive words of Suess himself, with which he\r\nconcludes his discussion of this very subject:\r\n\r\n\"As Rama looks across the ocean of the universe, and sees its surface\r\nblend in the distant horizon with the dipping sky, and as he considers\r\nif indeed a path might be built far out into the almost immeasurable\r\nspace, so we gaze over the ocean of the ages, but =no sign of a shore\r\nshows itself to our view=.\" (Id. p. 294.)\r\n\r\nAs for climate, I never heard any one suggest that cosmic changes of\r\nclimate are now known to be going on, much less that =sudden= changes of\r\nthe kind indicated by the North Siberian \"mummies\" are in the habit of\r\noccurring. In fact, we must all own that the mountains, the relative\r\nposition of land and water, as well as the climate of our globe, are\r\neach and all now in a state of stable equilibrium, and have been in this\r\nstate since the dawn of history or of scientific observation.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I ask, =How much time is needed= to account for the facts\r\nbefore us on the basis of Uniformity? In common honesty will a short\r\neternity itself satisfy the stern problem before us? I cannot see that\r\nit holds out the slightest promise of solving it; while, on the other\r\nhand, I am sure that, in dealing with the past of Man's existence\r\n(theories of evolution and all other theories of origins whatever cast\r\naside), we are not at liberty to make unreasonable demands of time. The\r\nevidence of history and archaeology is all against it.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter sciences it can be shown that at their very dawn we\r\nhave, over all the continents, a group of civilizations seldom equalled\r\nsince save in very modern times, and all so undeniably related to one\r\nanother and of such a character that they prove a previous state of\r\ncivilization in some locality =together=, before these scattered\r\nfragments of our race were dispersed abroad. We can track these various\r\npeoples all back to some region in Southwestern Asia, though the exact\r\nlocality for this source of inherited civilization has never yet been\r\nfound, and it is now almost certain that it is somehow lost in the\r\ngeological changes which have intervened. For when we cross the well\r\nmarked boundary line between history and geology, we have still to deal\r\nwith men who apparently =were not savages=, men who with tremendous\r\ndisadvantages could carve and draw and paint as no savages have ever\r\ndone, and who had evidently domesticated the horse and other animals.\r\nBut as to time, history gives no countenance to long time, i.e., what\r\ngeologists would call long. Good authentic history extends back a few\r\nscore centuries, archaeology may promise us a few more. As for\r\n=millions= of years, of even a few =hundred thousands=, the thing\r\nseems too absurd for discussion, unless we forsake inductive methods,\r\nand assume some form of evolution _a priori_.\r\n\r\nHence it ought to be evident that no amount of learned trifling with\r\ntime will solve our problem without supposing some strange event to have\r\nhappened our world and our race, long ago, and before the dawn of\r\nhistory. I see no possible way for scientific reasoning to avoid this\r\nconclusion. Ignoring for the present the Chaldean Deluge tablets, and\r\nwhat Rawlinson calls the \"consentient belief\" in a world-catastrophe\r\n\"among members of all the great races into which ethnologists have\r\ndivided mankind,\" which like their civilization has the earmarks of\r\nbeing =an inheritance= from some common source before their dispersion,\r\nwe may note that most geologists now admit the certainty of some sort of\r\ncatastrophe since man was upon the earth. I might mention Quatrefages\r\nand Dupont, Boyd Dawkins, Howorth, Prestwich, Wright and Sir William\r\nDawson, with many others. Even Eduard Suess teaches a somewhat similar\r\nlocal catastrophe, though like the others only as a reluctant concession\r\nto the insistent demands of Chaldean history and archaeological\r\ntradition. But all of these affairs are mere makeshifts in view of the\r\ntremendous demands of the purely geological evidence, and all alike\r\n(save perhaps those of Wright and Howorth) labor under the strange\r\ninconsistency of supposing that such an event could occur without\r\nleaving abundant and indelible marks upon the rocks of our globe. While\r\nin view of the evidence given through the previous pages, I insist that\r\nthe purely geological evidence of a world catastrophe is immeasurably\r\nstronger than that of archaeology, that in fact the whole geological\r\nphenomena constitute a cumulative argument of this nature.\r\n\r\nBut if this be granted, we must then inquire, What was its nature? and\r\nwhat its extent? The former is quite easily answered: the latter problem\r\nis still somewhat beyond our reach.\r\n\r\nAs to its character, the evidence is very plain. It was a veritable\r\ncataclysm of some sort: it deals with great changes of land and water\r\nsurface. If the geological succession is but a hoary myth, and if we\r\nfind countless modern living species of plants and animals mixed up in\r\nall the \"older\" rocks, we cannot ignore these in a rational and\r\nunprejudiced reconstruction of the science. But, ignoring these, we must\r\nremember that =even the Tertiary and post-Tertiary deposits are\r\nabsolutely world wide, and are packed with fossils of living species=.\r\nNot a continent and scarcely a country on the globe but contains great\r\nstretches of these deposits, laid down by the sea where now the land is\r\nhigh and dry. The sea and land have practically shifted places over all\r\nthe globe since Man and thousands of other living species left their\r\nfossils in the rocks. It is only the stupendous magnitude of these\r\nchanges which has made our scientists reluctant to admit the possibility\r\nof such a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nWith the myth of a life succession dissipated, a broad view of the\r\nfossil world cannot fail to convince the mind of the reality of some\r\nsuch cosmic convulsion, and convince it with all the force of a\r\nmathematical demonstration. Great groups of animals have dropped out of\r\nsight over all the continents, and their carcasses have been buried by\r\nsea water where we now find high plateaus or mountain ranges. Ignoring\r\ncompletely the abundant fossils in the so-called \"older\" rocks, and\r\nfixing our attention entirely on the Tertiary and Pleistocene beds that\r\nare acknowledged to be closely connected with the human race and the\r\nmodern world, we still have =a problem in race extinction alone= that\r\nappalls the mind. The mammoth, rhinoceros and mastodon, together with\r\n\"not less than thirty distinct species of the horse tribe,\" as Marsh\r\nsays, =all disappear from North America at one time=, and the most\r\ningenious disciple of Hutton and Lyell has been puzzled to invent a\r\nplausible explanation. But when we consider that at this same\r\n\"geological period\" =similar events were occurring on all the other\r\ncontinents=--the huge ground-sloths (megatheriums) and glyptodons in\r\nSouth America; \"wombats as large as tapirs,\" and \"kangaroos the size of\r\nelephants\" in Australia; the mammoth and woolly rhinoceros in Eurasia;\r\ntogether with an enormous hippopotamus, as far as England is concerned,\r\nto say nothing of those great bears, lions and hyenas, with a\r\nsemi-tropical vegetation, =all disappearing together at the same time=,\r\nor shifting to the other side of the world--it becomes almost like a\r\ndeliberate insult to our intellectual honesty to be approached with\r\noffers of \"explanations\" based on any so-called \"natural\" action of the\r\nforces of nature. But when, in addition to all this, we consider the\r\nfact that those human giants of the caves of Western Europe were\r\ncontemporary with the animals mentioned above, =and disappeared along\r\nwith them at this same time=, while mountain masses in all parts of the\r\nworld crowded with marine forms of the so-called \"older\" types\r\npositively =cannot be separated in time from the others=, it becomes as\r\ncertain as any other ordinary scientific fact, like sunrise or sunset,\r\nthat our once magnificently stocked world =met with some sudden and\r\nawful catastrophe in the long ago=; and is it in any way transgressing\r\nthe bounds of true inductive science to correlate this event with the\r\nDeluge of the Hebrew Scriptures and the traditions of every race on\r\nearth?\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how Dana supposes =two= such events, one at the\r\nclose of the \"Palaeozoic age,\" and the other at the close of the\r\n\"Mesozoic,\" merely to account for the astonishing disappearance of\r\nspecies at these periods when the fossils are arranged in taxonomic\r\norder; but if we once admit such an event =with Man and all the other\r\nspecies contemporary with one another=, where shall we limit its power\r\nto disturb the land and water and churn them all up together, leaving\r\nthe present simply as the ruins of that previous world? The fact is, the\r\ncurrent Geology is wholly built up from the Cambrian to the Pleistocene\r\non the =dogmatic denial= that any such catastrophe has occurred to the\r\nworld in which Man lived, for =one= such event happening in our modern\r\nhomogeneous world is enough to make the whole pretty scheme found in our\r\ntext-books tumble like a house of cards. Like the patient and exact\r\nobservations of the Ptolemaic astronomers, which accumulated volumes of\r\nevidence contradicting their own theories, and which in the hands of\r\nCopernicus and Galileo, Kepler and Newton, sealed the doom of\r\nastronomical speculation and laid the foundations of an exact science of\r\nthe heavens; so have the indefatigable labors of thousands of geologists\r\naccumulated evidence which strikes at the very foundation of the current\r\nUniformitarianism, and casts a pall of doubt over every conclusion as to\r\nhow or when any given deposit of the \"older\" rocks was produced.\r\n\r\nHere we must leave the question for the present. The possibility of such\r\na world-wide catastrophe, which might account for the major part of the\r\ngeological changes, needs no apology here. The slightest disturbance of\r\nthe nice equilibrium of our elements would suffice to send the waters of\r\nthe ocean careering over the land; and in the abundance of astronomical\r\ncauses competent for such disturbance we cease to regard such an event\r\nas necessarily contrary to \"natural law.\" The possibility of such a\r\nthing no competent scientist now denies; it is the problem of =recovery=\r\nfrom such a disaster which makes the perplexity. But incredible or not\r\nas the latter may be regarded, I claim to have established a perfect\r\nchain of scientific argument proving a world-wide catastrophe of some\r\nsort since Man was upon it. But this fact, if once admitted, strikes at\r\nthe very foundation of the current science, and bids us readjust our\r\ntheories from this view-point. The venerable scheme of a life succession\r\n=becomes only the taxonomic or classification series of the world that\r\nexisted before this disaster=, and it becomes the business of our\r\nscience to find out how many and what deposits were =due to this event=,\r\nand what were accumulated during the =unknown period= of previous\r\nexistence. Those of us who wish to speculate can then let our\r\nimaginations have free play as to the uncounted ages before that event;\r\nbut the \"phylogenic series\" as a rational scientific theory is in limbo\r\nforever. Inductive geology, therefore, deals not with the formation of a\r\nworld, but =with the ruins of one=; it can teach us absolutely nothing\r\nabout origins.\r\n\r\nThe latter problem lies across the boundary line in the domain of\r\nphilosophy and theology, and to these systems of thought we may\r\ncheerfully leave the task of readjustment in view of the facts here\r\npresented. A few disconnected thoughts along these lines I have ventured\r\nto insert here, not strictly as a part of my purely scientific argument,\r\nbut as an appendix.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[94] \"History,\" p. 320.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages I have endeavored to develop a scientific\r\nargument pure and simple. Yet I do not feel called upon to apologize in\r\nany way for attempting now to show the connection between an inductive\r\nscheme of Geology as set forth in the body of this work and the religion\r\nof Christianity; though my remarks along this line must necessarily be\r\nvery brief.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental idea of religion is the fatherhood of God as our\r\nCreator. The only true basis of morality lies in our relationship to Him\r\nas His creatures. During the latter half of the nineteenth century the\r\nBiblical idea of a creation at some definite and not very remote period\r\nin the past became much modified by reason of certain theories of\r\nevolution, which explained the origin of plants and animals as the\r\nresult of slow-acting causes, now in operation around us, prolonged over\r\nimmense ages of time. These theories, though built up wholly on the\r\ncurrent Geology as a foundation, were yet supposed to be firmly\r\nestablished in science, and after a spirited discussion among biologists\r\nfor a few years, were almost universally accepted in some form or other\r\nby the religious leaders of Christendom. And though the \"Theistic\r\nEvolution\" of recent years may be supposed to have modified somewhat the\r\nstern heartlessness of pure Darwinism, it still leaves the Christian\r\nworld quite at variance with the old Pauline doctrines regarding good\r\nand evil, creation, redemption, the atonement, etc.\r\n\r\nAnd these are not the only effects of the general acceptance of these\r\nideas as an explanation of the origin of things. We see their moral\r\neffects in the generation now coming on the stage of action--men\r\neducated in an atmosphere of Evolution, and accustomed from youth to the\r\nidea that all progress, whether in the individual or the race, is to be\r\nreached only by a ceaseless struggle for existence and survival at the\r\nexpense of others. In the words of Sir William Dawson, these doctrines\r\nhave \"stimulated to an intense degree that popular unrest so natural to\r\nan age discontented with its lot ... and which threatens to overthrow\r\nthe whole fabric of society as at present constituted.\"[95]\r\n\r\nThis popular and perfectly natural application of the evolution doctrine\r\nto every-day life is certainly intensifying, as never before, the innate\r\nselfishness of human nature, and, in every pursuit of life, embittering\r\nthe sad struggle for place and power. Perhaps no other one cause and\r\nresult serve more plainly to differentiate the present strenuous age\r\nfrom those that have gone before. The hitherto undreamed-of advantages\r\nand creature comforts of the present day, instead of tending toward\r\nuniversal peace and happiness, are apparently only giving a wider range\r\nto the discontent and depravity of the natural human heart. So much so,\r\nthat any one familiar with the history of nations cannot but feel a\r\nterrible foreboding creep over him as he faces the prospect presented\r\nto-day by civilised society the world over.\r\n\r\nThe only remedy for the many and increasing evils of our world is the\r\nold-fashioned religion of Christ and His apostles. And this applied, not\r\nto the state, but to the individual. The soul-regenerating truths of\r\nChristianity have always, wherever given a proper test by the\r\nindividual, resulted in moral uplift and blessing. Ecclesiastical\r\npolicies and ideas have always, wherever allowed to influence civil\r\nlegislation, resulted in oppression and tyranny.\r\n\r\nWhat has Geology to do with all this? It has much to do with it. Correct\r\nideas of geology will remove a great many vain notions--I had almost\r\nsaid superstitions--regarding our origin, which now pass under the name\r\nof science. And in thus removing false ideas it =leaves the ground\r\ncleared= for more correct ideas regarding =creation=, and thus for truer\r\nconcepts of =morality=, the old idea of \"must\" and \"ought\" based on our\r\nrelation to God as His creatures.\r\n\r\nMark the words I have used. =Inductive Geology can never prove\r\ncreation.= It may remove obstructions which have hitherto obscured this\r\nidea, but this is the utmost limit of any true science. Inductive\r\nGeology removes forever the succession-of-life idea, and thus may\r\n=suggest= the only seeming alternative, viz., Creation as the definite\r\nact of the Infinite God. Before this awful yet sublime fact, with all\r\nthe fogs of evolution and metaphysical subtleties cleared away, the\r\nhuman mind stands to-day as never before within historic times.\r\n\r\nWith a fairly complete knowledge of the chemical make-up of protoplasm,\r\nwith a good acquaintance with the life history and reproduction of\r\nliving cells, we yet =know nothing of the origin of life=. With a good\r\nworking knowledge of variation, hybridization, etc., =we know nothing of\r\nthe origin of species=. While with a fairly good understanding of the\r\npresent geographical distribution of species, and of where their fossils\r\noccur in the rocks, we are =profoundly ignorant of any particular order=\r\nin which these species originated on our globe, or whether they all took\r\norigin at =approximately one and the same time=. In short, having\r\nreached out along every known line of investigation, until we have\r\napparently reached the limits of the human powers in investigation and\r\nresearch, twentieth century science must stand with uncovered head and\r\nbowed form in presence of that most august thought of the human mind,\r\n\"=In the beginning God created=.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, personally, I am firmly convinced that the origin of life and\r\nof our cosmos, was according to law, and the laws of nature. As has been\r\nsaid, How could the origin of nature be contrary to nature? How could\r\nthe origin of present forms and conditions be in any way at variance\r\nwith the laws by which these forms or conditions are maintained? And\r\nwhile I do not consider it a very promising field of research, we ought\r\nto have no more reluctance, _per se_, to considering the manner in which\r\nthe first cell or the first species was formed, than the way in which a\r\nchicken is produced from the egg. Of course in either case we must have\r\nthe materials, and some outside Cause to originate the conditions and\r\nconduct the process; they both require the immanent presence and\r\nfostering care of the great Creator.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I beg leave to quote somewhat at length from my book,\r\n\"Outlines of Modern Science and Modern Christianity.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are getting no nearer the real mystery in the case by saying that\r\nall the tissues of the chick are built up by the protoplasm in the egg.\r\nThe protoplasm in the toes is the same as that in the little creature's\r\nbrain. Why does the one build up claws and the other brain cells? Does\r\nmemory guide these little things in their wonderful division of labor?\r\nBut they all started from one original germ cell, hence they all ought\r\nto have the same memory pictures. Or have they entered into a\r\nmutual-benefit arrangement, like the members of a community, as Haeckel\r\nwould have us believe, each contributing by actual desire and effort, I\r\nsuppose, an individual share to the general progress of the whole?--No;\r\nthey have all the appearance of being mere automata working at the\r\ndirect bidding of a Master Mind. Every step of the process needs a\r\nCreator, just as much as the first cell division. In the words of one of\r\nthe highest of scientific authorities, 'We still do not know why a\r\ncertain cell becomes a gland-cell, another a ganglion-cell; why one cell\r\ngives rise to a smooth muscle-fibre, while a neighbor forms voluntary\r\nmuscle;' and this also 'at certain, usually predestined, times in\r\nparticular places.'[96] And in the same way the idea of a Creator would\r\nnot be disposed of, even if we could possibly hit upon the probable\r\nprocess of world-formation. We would not, by understanding the process,\r\nreally get at the cause of the phenomena, any more than we do now at the\r\nreal cause of life. From the scientific method the real mystery remains\r\nas much behind the veil as ever before.\" (pp. 111, 112.)\r\n\r\nAgain I quote from this same work:\r\n\r\n\"The origin of organic nature could not well have been otherwise than by\r\nnatural process. Do we understand all natural processes? At some time\r\nlife was not in existence on our globe. All agree that it had a\r\nbeginning. Even if created by the great Creator, the living was at some\r\ntime formed from the not-living or the not-material. It does not take\r\neven Huxley's famous 'act of philosophic faith' to believe that. So\r\nthat, in spite of all the haze that has been thrown about this question,\r\nthe Biblical creation of the organic from the inorganic is no more\r\ncontrary to, or even outside of, natural law than is evolution....\r\n\r\n\"But see what we avoid. According to the Bible, death in even the lower\r\nanimals (and consequently all misery and suffering: the less is included\r\nin the greater) is only the result of sin on the part of man, the head\r\nof animated nature, a reflex or sympathetic result, if you will. But\r\nwith evolution we have countless millions of years of creature\r\nsuffering, cruelty, and death before man appeared at all, cruelty and\r\ndeath that ... have no moral meaning at all, save as the work of a fiend\r\ncreator, or a bungling or incompetent one.\"[97]\r\n\r\nThe author then gives a quotation from LeConte, illustrating the\r\nextremely various ways in which matter and energy act on the different\r\nplanes of their existence, while \"The passage from one plane upward to\r\nanother is not a gradual passage by sliding scale, but at one bound.\r\nWhen the necessary conditions are present, a new and higher form of\r\nforce at once appears, like birth into a higher sphere.... It is no\r\ngradual process, but sudden, like birth into a higher sphere.\"[98]\r\n\r\nThe argument then proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The living at some time originated from the not-living. =We call it\r\ncreation.= Can any one find a better name? It is preposterous to call it\r\na process of development or evolution due to the inherent properties of\r\nthe atoms, and effected by them alone. And yet it is doubtless as much\r\naccording to 'natural law' as are the invariable and exact combinations\r\nof chemistry. We do not understand the ultimate reasons for chemical\r\naffinity any more than we do for gravitation. They are only expressions\r\nof the methodical, order-loving mind of Deity. Creation was only another\r\naction of the same mind, and we are not really finding any new\r\ndifficulty when we say that the processes or the reasons for creative\r\naction are beyond our comprehension. When we can really solve some of\r\nthe myriad problems right before our eyes, it will be time enough to\r\ncomplain about creation being incomprehensible or contrary to 'natural\r\nlaw.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, remembering that, even according to Huxley's 'act of\r\nphilosophic faith,' the origin of the living from the not-living must at\r\nsome time have taken place according to natural law, =why should we\r\nsuppose that such a process was confined to one example=? If, when the\r\nyoung planet 'was passing through physical and chemical conditions which\r\nit can no more see again than a man can recall his infancy,' the\r\n'necessary conditions' were favorable for one such creation of life,\r\n=why not a few billion=? Would the production of a few billion such\r\nbeginnings of protoplasm be any less 'natural' than of one alone?\r\nRemember, however, that both the arrangement of these 'necessary\r\nconditions,' as well as the endowing of matter with these 'properties,'\r\nnot only requires a cause, but this cause must be intelligent, for there\r\nis indisputable design in this first origin of life.... The food for a\r\ndeveloping embryo might, for aught that we know, be conveyed to it\r\ndirect from the ultimate laboratories of nature, and it thus be built up\r\nby protoplasm in the usual way, without the medium of a parent\r\nform--other than the great Father of all. Or would it be any less\r\naccording to natural law to believe that a bird passed through all the\r\nusual stages of embryonic development from the not-living up to the\r\nfull-fledged songster of the skies =in one day=--the fifth day of\r\ncreation? And =if one example, why not a million=? For, remember that\r\nthe youthful earth was then passing through strange conditions, 'which,'\r\nas Huxley says, 'it can no more see again than a man can recall his\r\ninfancy.'\"[99]\r\n\r\nOmitting some remarks about embryology, I continue this quotation as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"But what 'law' would be violated in this springtime of the world if,\r\ninstead of twenty years or so for full development, the first man passed\r\nthrough all these stages =in one day=--the sixth of creation week? He\r\nmight as well have originated from the not-living as the evolutionist's\r\nfirst speck of protoplasm, for he certainly now starts from a mass of\r\nthis same protoplasm, identical, as we have seen, in all plants and\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\"And by originating thus, he would escape that horrible heritage of\r\nbestial and savage propensities which he would get through evolution, a\r\nheritage that would make it not his fault, but his misfortune, that sin\r\nand evil are in the world, and which would also shift the responsibility\r\nfor the evidently abnormal condition of 'this present evil world' off\r\nfrom the creature to the Creator, and change to us His character from\r\nthat of a loving Father, fettered by no conditions in His creation, to\r\nthat of either a bungling, incompetent workman or a heartless fiend;\r\nfor, though I am almost ashamed to write the words, the god of the\r\nevolutionist must be either the one or the other.\" (p. 121.)\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=With an appreciation nurtured by centuries of study of God's larger\r\nbook, baffled often though she has been, and disappointed many times in\r\nthe words she has endeavored to spell out, Science to-day proclaims its\r\nsubject, its title page, which she has now at last deciphered, \"In the\r\nbeginning God created the heaven and the earth.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[95] \"Modern Ideas of Evolution,\" p. 12.\r\n\r\n[96] \"_Nature_,\" May 23, 1901, pp. 75, 76.\r\n\r\n[97] \"Outlines,\" etc., p. 116.\r\n\r\n[98] \"Evolution and Religious Thought,\" pp. 314-316.\r\n\r\n[99] \"Outlines,\" etc., p. 119, 120.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT ON \"ILLOGICAL GEOLOGY\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving read the foregoing argument, will you now do the Publishers and\r\nthe author the favor of _filling out the following blank_ and mailing\r\nthis slip, or a copy of it, to us as early as possible?\r\n\r\nIt makes no difference to us even if your opinion is _adverse_.\r\n\r\n                                               THE MODERN HERETIC CO.\r\n    257 S.
