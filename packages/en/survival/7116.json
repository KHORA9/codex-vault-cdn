The sun,\r\nplanets, and satellites, with the less intelligible orbs termed comets,\r\nare comprehensively called the solar system, and if we take as the\r\nuttermost bounds of this system the orbit of Uranus (though the comets\r\nactually have a wider range), we shall find that it occupies a portion of\r\nspace not less than three thousand six hundred millions of miles in\r\nextent.  The mind fails to form an exact notion of a portion of space so\r\nimmense; but some faint idea of it may be obtained from the fact, that,\r\nif the swiftest race-horse ever known had begun to traverse it, at full\r\nspeed, at the time of the birth of Moses, he would only as yet have\r\naccomplished half his journey.\r\n\r\nIt has long been concluded amongst astronomers, that the stars, though\r\nthey only appear to our eyes as brilliant points, are all to be\r\nconsidered as suns, representing so many solar systems, each bearing a\r\ngeneral resemblance to our own.  The stars have a brilliancy and apparent\r\nmagnitude which we may safely presume to be in proportion to their actual\r\nsize and the distance at which they are placed from us.  Attempts have\r\nbeen made to ascertain the distance of some of the stars by calculations\r\nfounded on parallax, it being previously understood that, if a parallax\r\nof so much as one second, or the 3600th of a degree, could be ascertained\r\nin any one instance, the distance might be assumed in that instance as\r\nnot less than 19,200 millions of miles!  In the case of the most\r\nbrilliant star, Sirius, even this minute parallax could not be found;\r\nfrom which of course it was to be inferred that the distance of that star\r\nis something beyond the vast distance which has been stated.  In some\r\nothers, on which the experiment has been tried, no sensible parallax\r\ncould be detected; from which the same inference was to be made in their\r\ncase.  But a sensible parallax of about one second has been ascertained\r\nin the case of the double star, α α, of the constellation of the Centaur,\r\n{3} and one of the third of that amount for the double star, 61 Cygni;\r\nwhich gave reason to presume that the distance of the former might be\r\nabout twenty thousand millions of miles, and the latter of much greater\r\namount.  If we suppose that similar intervals exist between all the\r\nstars, we shall readily see that the space occupied by even the\r\ncomparatively small number visible to the naked eye, must be vast beyond\r\nall powers of conception.\r\n\r\nThe number visible to the eye is about three thousand; but when a\r\ntelescope of small power is directed to the heavens, a great number more\r\ncome into view, and the number is ever increased in proportion to the\r\nincreased power of the instrument.  In one place, where they are more\r\nthickly sown than elsewhere, Sir William Herschel reckoned that fifty\r\nthousand passed over a field of view two degrees in breadth in a single\r\nhour.  It was first surmised by the ancient philosopher, Democritus, that\r\nthe faintly white zone which spans the sky under the name of the Milky\r\nWay, might be only a dense collection of stars too remote to be\r\ndistinguished.  This conjecture has been verified by the instruments of\r\nmodern astronomers, and some speculations of a most remarkable kind have\r\nbeen formed in connexion with it.  By the joint labours of the two\r\nHerschels, the sky has been “gauged” in all directions by the telescope,\r\nso as to ascertain the conditions of different parts with respect to the\r\nfrequency of the stars.  The result has been a conviction that, as the\r\nplanets are parts of solar systems, so are solar systems parts of what\r\nmay be called astral systems—that is, systems composed of a multitude of\r\nstars, bearing a certain relation to each other.  The astral system to\r\nwhich we belong, is conceived to be of an oblong, flattish form, with a\r\nspace wholly or comparatively vacant in the centre, while the extremity\r\nin one direction parts into two.  The stars are most thickly sown in the\r\nouter parts of this vast ring, and these constitute the Milky Way.  Our\r\nsun is believed to be placed in the southern portion of the ring, near\r\nits inner edge, so that we are presented with many more stars, and see\r\nthe Milky Way much more clearly, in that direction, than towards the\r\nnorth, in which line our eye has to traverse the vacant central space.\r\nNor is this all.  Sir William Herschel, so early as 1783, detected a\r\nmotion in our solar system with respect to the stars, and announced that\r\nit was tending towards the star λ, in the constellation Hercules.  This\r\nhas been generally verified by recent and more exact calculations, {5}\r\nwhich fix on a point in Hercules, near the star 143 of the 17th hour,\r\naccording to Piozzi’s catalogue, as that towards which our sun is\r\nproceeding.  It is, therefore, receding from the inner edge of the ring.\r\nMotions of this kind, through such vast regions of space, must be long in\r\nproducing any change sensible to the inhabitants of our planet, and it is\r\nnot easy to grasp their general character; but grounds have nevertheless\r\nbeen found for supposing that not only our sun, but the other suns of the\r\nsystem pursue a wavy course round the ring _from west to east_, crossing\r\nand recrossing the middle of the annular circle.  “Some stars will depart\r\nmore, others less, from either side of the circumference of equilibrium,\r\naccording to the places in which they are situated, and according to the\r\ndirection and the velocity with which they are put in motion.  Our sun is\r\nprobably one of those which depart furthest from it, and descend furthest\r\ninto the empty space within the ring.” {6}  According to this view, a\r\ntime may come when we shall be much more in the thick of the stars of our\r\nastral system than we are now, and have of course much more brilliant\r\nnocturnal skies; but it may be countless ages before the eyes which are\r\nto see this added resplendence shall exist.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of the existence of other astral systems besides our own is\r\nmuch more decided than might be expected, when we consider that the\r\nnearest of them must needs be placed at a mighty interval beyond our own.\r\nThe elder Herschel, directing his wonderful tube towards the _sides_ of\r\nour system, where stars are planted most rarely, and raising the powers\r\nof the instrument to the required pitch, was enabled with awe-struck mind\r\nto see suspended in the vast empyrean astral systems, or, as he called\r\nthem, firmaments, resembling our own.  Like light cloudlets to a certain\r\npower of the telescope, they resolved themselves, under a greater power,\r\ninto stars, though these generally seemed no larger than the finest\r\nparticles of diamond dust.  The general forms of these systems are\r\nvarious; but one at least has been detected as bearing a striking\r\nresemblance to the supposed form of our own.  The distances are also\r\nvarious, as proved by the different degrees of telescopic power necessary\r\nto bring them into view.  The farthest observed by the astronomer were\r\nestimated by him as thirty-five thousand times more remote than Sirius,\r\nsupposing its distance to be about twenty thousand millions of miles.  It\r\nwould thus appear, that not only does gravitation keep our earth in its\r\nplace in the solar system, and the solar system in its place in our\r\nastral system, but it also may be presumed to have the mightier duty of\r\npreserving a local arrangement between that astral system and an\r\nimmensity of others, through which the imagination is left to wander on\r\nand on without limit or stay, save that which is given by its inability\r\nto grasp the unbounded.\r\n\r\nThe two Herschels have in succession made some other most remarkable\r\nobservations on the regions of space.  They have found within the limits\r\nof our astral system, and generally in its outer fields, a great number\r\nof objects which, from their foggy appearance, are called _nebulæ_; some\r\nof vast extent and irregular figure, as that in the sword of Orion, which\r\nis visible to the naked eye; others of shape more defined; others, again,\r\nin which small bright nuclei appear here and there over the surface.\r\nBetween this last form and another class of objects, which appear as\r\nclusters of nuclei with nebulous matter around each nucleus, there is but\r\na step in what appears a chain of related things.  Then, again, our\r\nastral space shews what are called nebulous stars,—namely, luminous\r\nspherical objects, bright in the centre and dull towards the extremities.\r\nThese appear to be only an advanced condition of the class of objects\r\nabove described.  Finally, nebulous stars exist in every stage of\r\nconcentration, down to that state in which we see only a common star with\r\na slight _bur_ around it.  It may be presumed that all these are but\r\nstages in a progress, just as if, seeing a child, a boy, a youth, a\r\nmiddle-aged, and an old man together, we might presume that the whole\r\nwere only variations of one being.  Are we to suppose that we have got a\r\nglimpse of the process through which a sun goes between its original\r\ncondition, as a mass of diffused nebulous matter, and its full-formed\r\nstate as a compact body?  We shall see how far such an idea is supported\r\nby other things known with regard to the occupants of space, and the laws\r\nof matter.\r\n\r\nA superficial view of the astronomy of the solar system gives us only the\r\nidea of a vast luminous body (the sun) in the centre, and a few smaller,\r\nthough various sized bodies, revolving at different distances around it;\r\nsome of these, again, having smaller planets (satellites) revolving\r\naround them.  There are, however, some general features of the solar\r\nsystem, which, when a profounder attention makes us acquainted with them,\r\nstrike the mind very forcibly.\r\n\r\nIt is, in the first place, remarkable, that the planets all move nearly\r\n_in one plane_, corresponding with the centre of the sun’s body.  Next,\r\nit is not less remarkable that the motion of the sun on its axis, those\r\nof the planets around the sun, and the satellites around their primaries,\r\n{9} and the motions of all on their axes, are _in one direction_—namely,\r\nfrom west to east.  Had all these matters been left to accident, the\r\nchances against the uniformity which we find would have been, though\r\ncalculable, inconceivably great.  Laplace states them at four millions of\r\nmillions to one.  It is thus powerfully impressed on us, that the\r\nuniformity of the motions, as well as their general adjustment to one\r\nplane, must have been a consequence of some cause acting throughout the\r\nwhole system.\r\n\r\nSome of the other relations of the bodies are not less remarkable.  The\r\nprimary planets shew a progressive increase of bulk and diminution of\r\ndensity, from the one nearest to the sun to that which is most distant.\r\nWith respect to density alone, we find, taking water as a measure and\r\ncounting it as one, that Saturn is 13/32, or less than half; Jupiter, 1\r\n1/24; Mars, 3 2/7; Earth, 4 1/2; Venus, 5 11/15; Mercury 9 9/10, or about\r\nthe weight of lead.  Then the distances are curiously relative.  It has\r\nbeen found that if we place the following line of numbers,—\r\n\r\n                          0 3 6 12 24 48 96 192,\r\n\r\nand add 4 to each, we shall have a series denoting the respective\r\ndistances of the planets from the sun.  It will stand thus—\r\n\r\n4           7           10          16          28      52          100         196\r\nMerc.       Venus.      Earth.      Mars.               Jupiter.    Saturn.     Uranus.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the first row of figures goes on from the second\r\non the left hand in a succession of duplications, or multiplications by\r\n2.  Surely there is here a most surprising proof of the unity which I am\r\nclaiming for the solar system.  It was remarked when this curious\r\nrelation was first detected, that there was a want of a planet\r\ncorresponding to 28; the difficulty was afterwards considered as in a\r\ngreat measure overcome, by the discovery of four small planets revolving\r\nat nearly one mean distance from the sun, between Mars and Jupiter.  The\r\ndistances bear an equally interesting mathematical relation to the times\r\nof the revolutions round the sun.  It has been found that, with respect\r\nto any two planets, the squares of the times of revolution are to each\r\nother in the same proportion as the cubes of their mean distances,—a most\r\nsurprising result, for the discovery of which the world was indebted to\r\nthe illustrious Kepler.  Sir John Herschel truly observes—“When we\r\ncontemplate the constituents of the planetary system from the point of\r\nview which this relation affords us, it is no longer mere analogy which\r\nstrikes us, no longer a general resemblance among them, as individuals\r\nindependent of each other, and circulating about the sun, each according\r\nto its own peculiar nature, and connected with it by its own peculiar\r\ntie.  The resemblance is now perceived to be a true _family likeness_;\r\nthey are bound up in one chain—interwoven in one web of mutual relation\r\nand harmonious agreement, subjected to one pervading influence which\r\nextends from the centre to the farthest limits of that great system, of\r\nwhich all of them, the Earth included, must henceforth be regarded as\r\nmembers.” {12}\r\n\r\nConnecting what has been observed of the series of nebulous stars with\r\nthis wonderful relationship seen to exist among the constituents of our\r\nsystem, and further taking advantage of the light afforded by the\r\nascertained laws of matter, modern astronomers have suggested the\r\nfollowing hypothesis of the formation of that system.\r\n\r\nOf nebulous matter in its original state we know too little to enable us\r\nto suggest how nuclei should be established in it.  But, supposing that,\r\nfrom a peculiarity in its constitution, nuclei are formed, we know very\r\nwell how, by virtue of the law of gravitation, the process of an\r\naggregation of the neighbouring matter to those nuclei should proceed,\r\nuntil masses more or less solid should become detached from the rest.  It\r\nis a well-known law in physics that, when fluid matter collects towards\r\nor meets in a centre, it establishes a rotatory motion.  See minor\r\nresults of this law in the whirlwind and the whirlpool—nay, on so humble\r\na scale as the water sinking through the aperture of a funnel.  It thus\r\nbecomes certain that when we arrive at the stage of a nebulous star, we\r\nhave a rotation on an axis commenced.\r\n\r\nNow, mechanical philosophy informs us that, the instant a mass begins to\r\nrotate, there is generated a tendency to fling off its outer portions—in\r\nother words, the law of centrifugal force begins to operate.  There are,\r\nthen, two forces acting in opposition to each other, the one attracting\r\n_to_, the other throwing _from_, the centre.  While these remain exactly\r\ncounterpoised, the mass necessarily continues entire; but the least\r\nexcess of the centrifugal over the attractive force would be attended\r\nwith the effect of separating the mass and its outer parts.  These outer\r\nparts would, then, be left as a ring round the central body, which ring\r\nwould continue to revolve with the velocity possessed by the central mass\r\nat the moment of separation, but not necessarily participating in any\r\nchanges afterwards undergone by that body.  This is a process which might\r\nbe repeated as soon as a new excess arose in the centrifugal over the\r\nattractive forces working in the parent mass.  It might, indeed, continue\r\nto be repeated, until the mass attained the ultimate limits of the\r\ncondensation which its constitution imposed upon it.  From what cause\r\nmight arise the periodical occurrence of an excess of the centrifugal\r\nforce?  If we suppose the agglomeration of a nebulous mass to be a\r\nprocess attended by refrigeration or cooling, which many facts render\r\nlikely, we can easily understand why the outer parts, hardening under\r\nthis process, might, by virtue of the greater solidity thence acquired,\r\nbegin to present some resistance to the attractive force.  As the\r\nsolidification proceeded, this resistance would become greater, though\r\nthere would still be a tendency to adhere.  Meanwhile, the condensation\r\nof the central mass would be going on, tending to produce a separation\r\nfrom what may now be termed the _solidifying crust_.  During the\r\ncontention between the attractions of these two bodies, or parts of one\r\nbody, there would probably be a ring of attenuation between the mass and\r\nits crust.  At length, when the central mass had reached a certain stage\r\nin its advance towards solidification, a separation would take place, and\r\nthe crust would become a detached ring.  It is clear, of course, that\r\nsome law presiding over the refrigeration of heated gaseous bodies would\r\ndetermine the stages at which rings were thus formed and detached.  We do\r\nnot know any such law, but what we have seen assures us it is one\r\nobserving and reducible to mathematical formulæ.\r\n\r\nIf these rings consisted of matter nearly uniform throughout, they would\r\nprobably continue each in its original form; but there are many chances\r\nagainst their being uniform in constitution.  The unavoidable effects of\r\nirregularity in their constitution would be to cause them to gather\r\ntowards centres of superior solidity, by which the annular form would, of\r\ncourse, be destroyed.  The ring would, in short, break into several\r\nmasses, the largest of which would be likely to attract the lesser into\r\nitself.  The whole mass would then necessarily settle into a spherical\r\nform by virtue of the law of gravitation; in short, would then become a\r\nplanet revolving round the sun.  Its rotatory motion would, of course,\r\ncontinue, and satellites might then be thrown off in turn from its body\r\nin exactly the same way as the primary planets had been thrown off from\r\nthe sun.  The rule, if I can be allowed so to call it, receives a\r\nstriking support from what appear to be its exceptions.  While there are\r\nmany chances against the matter of the rings being sufficiently equable\r\nto remain in the annular form till they were consolidated, it might\r\nnevertheless be otherwise in some instances; that is to say, the\r\nequableness might, in those instances, be sufficiently great.  Such was\r\nprobably the case with the two rings around the body of Saturn, which\r\nremain a living picture of the arrangement, if not the condition, in\r\nwhich all the planetary masses at one time stood.  It may also be\r\nadmitted that, when a ring broke up, it was possible that the fragments\r\nmight spherify separately.  Such seems to be the actual history of the\r\nring between Jupiter and Mars, in whose place we now find four planets\r\nmuch beneath the smallest of the rest in size, and moving nearly at the\r\nsame distance from the sun, though in orbits so elliptical, and of such\r\ndifferent planes, that they keep apart.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that there are mathematical proportions in the relative\r\ndistances and revolutions of the planets of our system.  It has also been\r\nsuggested that the periods in the condensation of the nebulous mass, at\r\nwhich rings were disengaged, must have depended on some particular crises\r\nin the condition of that mass, in connexion with the laws of centrifugal\r\nforce and attraction.  M. Compte, of Paris, has made some approach to the\r\nverification of the hypothesis, by calculating what ought to have been\r\nthe rotation of the solar mass at the successive times when its surface\r\nextended to the various planetary orbits.  He ascertained that _that\r\nrotation corresponded in every case with the actual sidereal revolution\r\nof the planets_, _and that the rotation of the primary planets in like\r\nmanner corresponded with the orbitual periods of the secondaries_.  The\r\nprocess by which he arrived at this conclusion is not to be readily\r\ncomprehended by the unlearned; but those who are otherwise, allow that it\r\nis a powerful support to the present hypothesis of the formation of the\r\nglobes of space. {17}\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis, as it has been called, obtains a remarkable\r\nsupport in what would at first seem to militate against it—the existence\r\nin our firmament of several thousands of solar systems, in which there\r\nare more than one sun.  These are called double and triple stars.  Some\r\ndouble stars, upon which careful observations have been made, are found\r\nto have a regular revolutionary motion round each other in ellipses.\r\nThis kind of solar system has also been observed in what appears to be\r\nits rudimental state, for there are examples of nebulous stars containing\r\ntwo and three nuclei in near association.  At a certain point in the\r\nconfluence of the matter of these nebulous stars, they would all become\r\ninvolved in a common revolutionary motion, linked inextricably with each\r\nother, though it might be at sufficient distances to allow of each\r\ndistinct centre having afterwards its attendant planets.  We have seen\r\nthat the law which causes rotation in the single solar masses, is exactly\r\nthe same which produces the familiar phenomenon of a small whirlpool or\r\ndimple in the surface of a stream.  Such dimples are not always single.\r\nUpon the face of a river where there are various contending currents, it\r\nmay often be observed that two or more dimples are formed near each other\r\nwith more or less regularity.  These fantastic eddies, which the musing\r\npoet will sometimes watch abstractedly for an hour, little thinking of\r\nthe law which produces and connects them, are an illustration of the\r\nwonders of binary and ternary solar systems.\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis is, indeed, supported by so many ascertained\r\nfeatures of the celestial scenery, and by so many calculations of exact\r\nscience, that it is impossible for a candid mind to refrain from giving\r\nit a cordial reception, if not to repose full reliance upon it, even\r\nwithout seeking for it support of any other kind.  Some other support I\r\ntrust yet to bring to it; but in the meantime, assuming its truth, let us\r\nsee what idea it gives of the constitution of what we term the universe,\r\nof the development of its various parts, and of its original condition.\r\n\r\nReverting to a former illustration—if we could suppose a number of\r\npersons of various ages presented to the inspection of an intelligent\r\nbeing newly introduced into the world, we cannot doubt that he would soon\r\nbecome convinced that men had once been boys, that boys had once been\r\ninfants, and, finally, that all had been brought into the world in\r\nexactly the same circumstances.  Precisely thus, seeing in our astral\r\nsystem many thousands of worlds in all stages of formation, from the most\r\nrudimental to that immediately preceding the present condition of those\r\nwe deem perfect, it is unavoidable to conclude that all the perfect have\r\ngone through the various stages which we see in the rudimental.  This\r\nleads us at once to the conclusion that the whole of our firmament was at\r\none time a diffused mass of nebulous matter, extending through the space\r\nwhich it still occupies.  So also, of course, must have been the other\r\nastral systems.  Indeed, we must presume the whole to have been\r\noriginally in one connected mass, the astral systems being only the first\r\ndivision into parts, and solar systems the second.\r\n\r\nThe first idea which all this impresses upon us is, that the formation of\r\nbodies in space is _still and at present in progress_.  We live at a time\r\nwhen many have been formed, and many are still forming.  Our own solar\r\nsystem is to be regarded as completed, supposing its perfection to\r\nconsist in the formation of a series of planets, for there are\r\nmathematical reasons for concluding that Mercury is the nearest planet to\r\nthe sun, which can, according to the laws of the system, exist.  But\r\nthere are other solar systems within our astral system, which are as yet\r\nin a less advanced state, and even some quantities of nebulous matter\r\nwhich have scarcely begun to advance towards the stellar form.  On the\r\nother hand, there are vast numbers of stars which have all the appearance\r\nof being fully formed systems, if we are to judge from the complete and\r\ndefinite appearance which they present to our vision through the\r\ntelescope.  We have no means of judging of the seniority of systems; but\r\nit is reasonable to suppose that, among the many, some are older than\r\nours.  There is, indeed, one piece of evidence for the probability of the\r\ncomparative youth of our system, altogether apart from human traditions\r\nand the geognostic appearances of the surface of our planet.  This\r\nconsists in a thin nebulous matter, which is diffused around the sun to\r\nnearly the orbit of Mercury, of a very oblately spheroidal shape.  This\r\nmatter, which sometimes appears to our naked eyes, at sunset, in the form\r\nof a cone projecting upwards in the line of the sun’s path, and which\r\nbears the name of the Zodiacal Light, has been thought a residuum or last\r\nremnant of the concentrating matter of our system, and thus may be\r\nsupposed to indicate the comparative recentness of the principal events\r\nof our cosmogony.  Supposing the surmise and inference to be correct, and\r\nthey may be held as so far supported by more familiar evidence, we might\r\nwith the more confidence speak of our system as not amongst the elder\r\nborn of Heaven, but one whose various phenomena, physical and moral, as\r\nyet lay undeveloped, while myriads of others were fully fashioned and in\r\ncomplete arrangement.  Thus, in the sublime chronology to which we are\r\ndirecting our inquiries, we first find ourselves called upon to consider\r\nthe globe which we inhabit as a child of the sun, elder than Venus and\r\nher younger brother Mercury, but posterior in date of birth to Mars,\r\nJupiter, Saturn, and Uranus; next to regard our whole system as probably\r\nof recent formation in comparison with many of the stars of our\r\nfirmament.  We must, however, be on our guard against supposing the earth\r\nas a recent globe in our ordinary conceptions of time.  From evidence\r\nafterwards to be adduced, it will be seen that it cannot be presumed to\r\nbe less than many hundreds of centuries old.  How much older Uranus may\r\nbe no one can tell, much less how more aged may be many of the stars of\r\nour firmament, or the stars of other firmaments than ours.\r\n\r\nAnother and more important consideration arises from the hypothesis;\r\nnamely, as to the means by which the grand process is conducted.  The\r\nnebulous matter collects around nuclei by virtue of the law of\r\nattraction.  The agglomeration brings into operation another physical\r\nlaw, by force of which the separate masses of matter are either made to\r\nrotate singly, or, in addition to that single motion, are set into a\r\ncoupled revolution in ellipses.  Next centrifugal force comes into play,\r\nflinging off portions of the rotating masses, which become spheres by\r\nvirtue of the same law of attraction, and are held in orbits of\r\nrevolution round the central body by means of a composition between the\r\ncentrifugal and gravitating forces.  All, we see, is done by certain laws\r\nof matter, so that it becomes a question of extreme interest, what are\r\nsuch laws?  All that can yet be said, in answer, is, that we see certain\r\nnatural events proceeding in an invariable order under certain\r\nconditions, and thence infer the existence of some fundamental\r\narrangement which, for the bringing about of these events, has a force\r\nand certainty of action similar to, but more precise and unerring than\r\nthose arrangements which human society makes for its own benefit, and\r\ncalls laws.  It is remarkable of physical laws, that we see them\r\noperating on every kind of scale as to magnitude, with the same\r\nregularity and perseverance.  The tear that falls from childhood’s cheek\r\nis globular, through the efficacy of that same law of mutual attraction\r\nof particles which made the sun and planets round.  The rapidity of\r\nMercury is quicker than that of Saturn, for the same reason that, when we\r\nwheel a ball round by a string and make the string wind up round our\r\nfingers, the ball always flies quicker and quicker as the string is\r\nshortened.  Two eddies in a stream, as has been stated, fall into a\r\nmutual revolution at the distance of a couple of inches, through the same\r\ncause which makes a pair of suns link in mutual revolution at the\r\ndistance of millions of miles.  There is, we might say, a sublime\r\nsimplicity in this indifference of the grand regulations to the vastness\r\nor minuteness of the field of their operation.  Their being uniform, too,\r\nthroughout space, as far as we can scan it, and their being so unfailing\r\nin their tendency to operate, so that only the proper conditions are\r\npresented, afford to our minds matter for the gravest consideration.  Nor\r\nshould it escape our careful notice that the regulations on which all the\r\nlaws of matter operate, are established on a rigidly accurate\r\nmathematical basis.  Proportions of numbers and geometrical figures rest\r\nat the bottom of the whole.  All these considerations, when the mind is\r\nthoroughly prepared for them, tend to raise our ideas with respect to the\r\ncharacter of physical laws, even though we do not go a single step\r\nfurther in the investigation.  But it is impossible for an intelligent\r\nmind to stop there.  We advance from law to the cause of law, and ask,\r\nWhat is that?  Whence have come all these beautiful regulations?  Here\r\nscience leaves us, but only to conclude, from other grounds, that there\r\nis a First Cause to which all others are secondary and ministrative, a\r\nprimitive almighty will, of which these laws are merely the mandates.\r\nThat great Being, who shall say where is his dwelling-place, or what his\r\nhistory!  Man pauses breathless at the contemplation of a subject so much\r\nabove his finite faculties, and only can wonder and adore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUENT MATERIALS OF THE EARTH\r\nAND OF THE OTHER BODIES OF SPACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE nebular hypothesis almost necessarily supposes matter to have\r\noriginally formed one mass.  We have seen that the same physical laws\r\npreside over the whole.  Are we also to presume that the constitution of\r\nthe whole was uniform?—that is to say, that the whole consisted of\r\nsimilar elements.  It seems difficult to avoid coming to this conclusion,\r\nat least under the qualification that, possibly, various bodies, under\r\npeculiar circumstances attending their formation, may contain elements\r\nwhich are wanting, and lack some which are present in others, or that\r\nsome may entirely consist of elements in which others are entirely\r\ndeficient.\r\n\r\nWhat are elements?  This is a term applied by the chemist to a certain\r\nlimited number of substances, (fifty-four or fifty-five are ascertained,)\r\nwhich, in their combinations, form all the matters of every kind present\r\nin and about our globe.  They are called elements, or simple substances,\r\nbecause it has hitherto been found impossible to reduce them into others,\r\nwherefore they are presumed to be the primary bases of all matters.  It\r\nhas, indeed, been surmised that these so-called elements are only\r\nmodifications of a primordial form of matter, brought about under certain\r\nconditions; but if this should prove to be the case, it would little\r\naffect the view which we are taking of cosmical arrangements.  Analogy\r\nwould lead us to conclude that the combinations of the primordial matter,\r\nforming our so-called elements, are as universal or as liable to take\r\nplace everywhere as are the laws of gravitation and centrifugal force.\r\nWe must therefore presume that the gases, the metals, the earths, and\r\nother simple substances, (besides whatever more of which we have no\r\nacquaintance,) exist or are liable to come into existence under proper\r\nconditions, as well in the astral system, which is thirty-five thousand\r\ntimes more distant than Sirius, as within the bounds of our own solar\r\nsystem or our own globe.\r\n\r\nMatter, whether it consist of about fifty-five ingredients, or only one,\r\nis liable to infinite varieties of condition under different\r\ncircumstances, or, to speak more philosophically, under different laws.\r\nAs a familiar illustration, water, when subjected to a temperature under\r\n32° Fahrenheit, becomes ice; raise the temperature to 212°, and it\r\nbecomes steam, occupying a vast deal more space than it formerly did.\r\nThe gases, when subjected to pressure, become liquids; for example,\r\ncarbonic acid gas, when subjected to a weight equal to a column of water\r\n1230 feet high, at a temperature of 32°, takes this form: the other gases\r\nrequire various amounts of pressure for this transformation, but all\r\nappear to be liable to it when the pressure proper in each case is\r\nadministered.  Heat is a power greatly concerned in regulating the volume\r\nand other conditions of matter.  A chemist can reckon with considerable\r\nprecision what additional amount of heat would be required to vaporise\r\nall the water of our globe; how much more to disengage the oxygen which\r\nis diffused in nearly a proportion of one-half throughout its solids;\r\nand, finally, how much more would be required to cause the whole to\r\nbecome vaporiform, which we may consider as equivalent to its being\r\nrestored to its original nebulous state.  He can calculate with equal\r\ncertainty what would be the effect of a considerable diminution of the\r\nearth’s temperature—what changes would take place in each of its\r\ncomponent substances, and how much the whole would shrink in bulk.\r\n\r\nThe earth and all its various substances have at present a certain volume\r\nin consequence of the temperature which actually exists.  When, then, we\r\nfind that its matter and that of the associate planets was at one time\r\ndiffused throughout the whole space, now circumscribed by the orbit of\r\nUranus, we cannot doubt, after what we know of the power of heat, that\r\nthe nebulous form of matter was attended by the condition of a very high\r\ntemperature.  The nebulous matter of space, previously to the formation\r\nof stellar and planetary bodies, must have been a universal Fire Mist, an\r\nidea which we can scarcely comprehend, though the reasons for arriving at\r\nit seem irresistible.  The formation of systems out of this matter\r\nimplies a change of some kind with regard to the condition of the heat.\r\nHad this power continued to act with its full original repulsive energy,\r\nthe process of agglomeration by attraction could not have gone on.  We do\r\nnot know enough of the laws of heat to enable us to surmise how the\r\nnecessary change in this respect was brought about, but we can trace some\r\nof the steps and consequences of the process.  Uranus would be formed at\r\nthe time when the heat of our system’s matter was at the greatest, Saturn\r\nat the next, and so on.  Now this tallies perfectly with the exceeding\r\ndiffuseness of the matter of those elder planets, Saturn being not more\r\ndense or heavy than the substance cork.  It may be that a sufficiency of\r\nheat still remains in those planets to make up for their distance from\r\nthe sun, and the consequent smallness of the heat which they derive from\r\nhis rays.  And it may equally be, since Mercury is twice the density of\r\nthe earth, that its matter exists under a degree of cold for which that\r\nplanet’s large enjoyment of the sun’s rays is no more than a\r\ncompensation.  Thus there may be upon the whole a nearly equal experience\r\nof heat amongst all these children of the sun.  Where, meanwhile, is the\r\nheat once diffused through the system over and above what remains in the\r\nplanets?  May we not rationally presume it to have gone to constitute\r\nthat luminous envelope of the sun, in which his warmth-giving power is\r\nnow held to reside?  It could not be destroyed—it cannot be supposed to\r\nhave gone off into space—it must have simply been reserved to constitute,\r\nat the last, a means of sustaining the many operations of which the\r\nplanets were destined to be the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the whole of the preceding considerations is to bring the\r\nconviction that our globe is a specimen of all the similarly-placed\r\nbodies of space, as respects its constituent matter and the physical and\r\nchemical laws governing it, with only this qualification, that there are\r\n_possibly_ shades of variation with respect to the component materials,\r\nand _undoubtedly_ with respect to the conditions under which the laws\r\noperate, and consequently the effects which they produce.  Thus, there\r\nmay be substances here which are not in some other bodies, and substances\r\nhere solid may be elsewhere liquid or vaporiform.  We are the more\r\nentitled to draw such conclusions, seeing that there is nothing at all\r\nsingular or special in the astronomical situation of the earth.  It takes\r\nits place third in a series of planets, which series is only one of\r\nnumberless other systems forming one group.  It is strikingly—if I may\r\nuse such an expression—a member of a democracy.  Hence, we cannot suppose\r\nthat there is any peculiarity about it which does not probably attach to\r\nmultitudes of other bodies—in fact, to all that are analogous to it in\r\nrespect of cosmical arrangements.\r\n\r\nIt therefore becomes a point of great interest—what are the materials of\r\nthis specimen?  What is the constitutional character of this object,\r\nwhich may be said to be a sample, presented to our immediate observation,\r\nof those crowds of worlds which seem to us as the particles of the desert\r\nsand-cloud in number, and to whose profusion there are no conceivable\r\nlocal limits?\r\n\r\nThe solids, liquids, and aeriform fluids of our globe are all, as has\r\nbeen stated, reducible into fifty-five substances hitherto called\r\nelementary.  Six are gases; oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen being the\r\nchief.  Forty-two are metals, of which eleven are remarkable as\r\ncomposing, in combination with oxygen, certain earths, as magnesia, lime,\r\nalumin.  The remaining six, including carbon, silicon, sulphur, have not\r\nany general appellation.\r\n\r\nThe gas oxygen is considered as by far the most abundant substance in our\r\nglobe.  It constitutes a fifth part of our atmosphere, a third part of\r\nwater, and a large proportion of every kind of rock in the crust of the\r\nearth.  Hydrogen, which forms two-thirds of water, and enters into some\r\nmineral substances, is perhaps next.  Nitrogen, of which the atmosphere\r\nis four-fifths composed, must be considered as an abundant substance.\r\nThe metal silicium, which unites with oxygen in nearly equal parts to\r\nform silica, the basis of nearly a half of the rocks in the earth’s\r\ncrust, is, of course, an important ingredient.  Aluminium, the metallic\r\nbasis of alumin, a large material in many rocks, is another abundant\r\nelementary substance.  So, also, is carbon a small ingredient in the\r\natmosphere, but the chief constituent of animal and vegetable substances,\r\nand of all fossils which ever were in the latter condition, amongst which\r\ncoal takes a conspicuous place.  The familiarly-known metals, as iron,\r\ntin, lead, silver, gold, are elements of comparatively small magnitude in\r\nthat exterior part of the earth’s body which we are able to investigate.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable of the simple substances that they are generally in some\r\ncompound form.  Thus, oxygen and nitrogen, though in union they form the\r\naerial envelope of the globe, are never found separate in nature.  Carbon\r\nis pure only in the diamond.  And the metallic bases of the earths,\r\nthough the chemist can disengage them, may well be supposed unlikely to\r\nremain long uncombined, seeing that contact with moisture makes them\r\nburn.  Combination and re-combination are principles largely pervading\r\nnature.  There are few rocks, for example, that are not composed of at\r\nleast two varieties of matter, each of which is again a compound of\r\nelementary substances.  What is still more wonderful with respect to this\r\nprinciple of combination, all the elementary substances observe certain\r\nmathematical proportions in their unions.  One volume of them unites with\r\none, two, three, or more volumes of another, any extra quantity being\r\nsure to be left over, if such there should be.  It is hence supposed that\r\nmatter is composed of infinitely minute particles or atoms, each of which\r\nbelonging to any one substance, can only (through the operation of some\r\nas yet hidden law) associate with a certain number of the atoms of any\r\nother.  There are also strange predilections amongst substances for each\r\nother’s company.  One will remain combined in solution with another, till\r\na third is added, when it will abandon the former and attach itself to\r\nthe latter.  A fourth being added, the third will perhaps leave the\r\nfirst, and join the new comer.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the information which chemistry gives us regarding\r\nthe constituent materials of our globe.  How infinitely is the knowledge\r\nincreased in interest, when we consider the probability of such being the\r\nmaterials of the whole of the bodies of space, and the laws under which\r\nthese everywhere combine, subject only to local and accidental\r\nvariations!\r\n\r\nIn considering the cosmogenic arrangements of our globe, our attention is\r\ncalled in a special degree to the moon.\r\n\r\nIn the nebular hypothesis, satellites are considered as masses thrown off\r\nfrom their primaries, exactly as the primaries had previously been from\r\nthe sun.  The orbit of any satellite is also to be regarded as marking\r\nthe bounds of the mass of the primary at the time when that satellite was\r\nthrown off; its speed likewise denotes the rapidity of the rotatory\r\nmotion of the primary at that particular juncture.  For example, the\r\noutermost of the four satellites of Jupiter revolves round his body at\r\nthe distance of 1,180,582 miles, shewing that the planet was once\r\n3,675,501 miles in circumference, instead of being, as now, only 89,170\r\nmiles in diameter.  This large mass took rather more than sixteen days\r\nsix hours and a half (the present revolutionary period of the outermost\r\nsatellite) to rotate on its axis.  The innermost satellite must have been\r\nformed when the planet was reduced to a circumference of 309,075 miles,\r\nand rotated in about forty-two hours and a half.\r\n\r\nFrom similar inferences, we find that the mass of the earth, at a certain\r\npoint of time after it was thrown off from the sun, was no less than\r\n482,000 miles in diameter, being sixty times what it has since shrunk to.\r\nAt that time, the mass must have taken rather more than twenty-nine and a\r\nhalf days to rotate, (being the revolutionary period of the moon,)\r\ninstead of as now, rather less than twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe time intervening between the formation of the moon and the earth’s\r\ndiminution to its present size, was probably one of those vast sums in\r\nwhich astronomy deals so largely, but which the mind altogether fails to\r\ngrasp.\r\n\r\nThe observations made upon the surface of the moon by telescopes, tend\r\nstrongly to support the hypothesis as to all the bodies of space being\r\ncomposed of similar matters, subject to certain variations.  It does not\r\nappear that our satellite is provided with that gaseous envelope which,\r\non earth, performs so many important functions.  Neither is there any\r\nappearance of water upon the surface; yet that surface is, like that of\r\nour globe, marked by inequalities and the appearance of volcanic\r\noperations.  These inequalities and volcanic operations are upon a scale\r\nfar greater than any which now exist upon the earth’s surface.  Although,\r\nfrom the greater force of gravitation upon its exterior, the mountains,\r\nother circumstances being equal, might have been expected to be much\r\nsmaller than ours, they are, in many instances, equal in height to nearly\r\nthe highest of our Andes.  They are generally of extreme steepness, and\r\nsharp of outline, a peculiarity which might be looked for in a planet\r\ndeficient in water and atmosphere, seeing that these are the agents which\r\nwear down ruggedness on the surface of our earth.  The volcanic\r\noperations are on a stupendous scale.  They are the cause of the bright\r\nspots of the moon, while the want of them is what distinguishes the\r\nduller portions, usually but erroneously called _seas_.  In some parts,\r\nbright volcanic matter, besides covering one large patch, radiates out in\r\nlong streams, which appear studded with subordinate _foci_ of the same\r\nkind of energy.  Other objects of a most remarkable character are ring\r\nmountains, mounts like those of the craters of earthly volcanoes,\r\nsurrounded immediately by vast and profound circular pits, hollowed under\r\nthe general surface, these again being surrounded by a circular wall of\r\nmountain, rising far above the central one, and in the inside of which\r\nare terraces about the same height as the inner eminence.  The well-known\r\nbright spot in the south-east quarter, called by astronomers _Tycho_, and\r\nwhich can be readily distinguished by the naked eye, is one of these\r\nring-mountains.  There is one of 200 miles in diameter, with a pit 22,000\r\nfeet deep; that is, twice the height of Ætna.  It is remarkable, that the\r\nmaps given by Humboldt of a volcanic district in South America, and one\r\nillustrative of the formerly volcanic district of Auvergne, in France,\r\npresent features strikingly like many parts of the moon’s surface, as\r\nseen through a good glass.\r\n\r\nThese characteristics of the moon forbid the idea that it can be at\r\npresent a theatre of life like the earth, and almost seem to declare that\r\nit never can become so.  But we must not rashly draw any such\r\nconclusions.  The moon may be only in an earlier stage of the progress\r\nthrough which the earth has already gone.  The elements which seem\r\nwanting may be only in combinations different in those which exist here,\r\nand may yet be developed as we here find them.  Seas may yet fill the\r\nprofound hollows of the surface; an atmosphere may spread over the whole.\r\nShould these events take place, meteorological phenomena, and all the\r\nphenomena of organic life, will commence, and the moon, like the earth,\r\nwill become a green and inhabited world.\r\n\r\nIt is unavoidably held as a strong proof in favour of any hypothesis,\r\nwhen all the relative phenomena are in harmony with it.  This is\r\neminently the case with the nebulous hypothesis, for here the associated\r\nfacts cannot be explained on any other supposition.  We have seen reason\r\nto conclude that the primary condition of matter was that of a diffused\r\nmass, in which the component molecules were probably kept apart through\r\nthe efficacy of heat; that portions of this agglomerated into suns, which\r\nthrew off planets; that these planets were at first very much diffused,\r\nbut gradually contracted by cooling to their present dimensions.  Now, as\r\nto our own globe, there is a remarkable proof of its having been in a\r\nfluid state at the time when it was finally solidifying, in the fact of\r\nits being bulged at the equator, the very form which a soft revolving\r\nbody takes, and must inevitably take, under the influence of centrifugal\r\nforce.  This bulging makes the equatorial exceed the polar diameter as\r\n230 to 229, which has been demonstrated to be precisely the departure\r\nfrom a correct sphere which might be predicated from a knowledge of the\r\namount of the mass and the rate of rotation.  There is an almost equally\r\ndistinct memorial of the original high temperature of the materials, in\r\nthe store of heat which still exists in the interior.  The immediate\r\nsurface of the earth, be it observed, exhibits only the temperature which\r\nmight be expected to be imparted to such materials, by the heat of the\r\nsun.  There is a point, very short way down, but varying in different\r\nclimes, where all effect from the sun’s rays ceases.  Then, however,\r\ncommences a temperature from an entirely different cause, one which\r\nevidently has its source in the interior of the earth, and which\r\nregularly increases as we descend to greater and greater depths, the rate\r\nof increment being about one degree Fahrenheit for every sixty feet; and\r\nof this high temperature there are other evidences, in the phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes and thermal springs, as well as in what is ascertained with\r\nregard to the density of the entire mass of the earth.  This, it will be\r\nremembered, is four and a half times the weight of water; but the actual\r\nweight of the principal solid substances composing the outer crust is as\r\ntwo and a half times the weight of water; and this, we know, if the globe\r\nwere solid and cold, should increase vastly towards the centre, water\r\nacquiring the density of quicksilver at 362 miles below the surface, and\r\nother things in proportion, and these densities becoming much greater at\r\ngreater depths; so that the entire mass of a cool globe should be of a\r\ngravity infinitely exceeding four and a half times the weight of water.\r\nThe only alternative supposition is, that the central materials are\r\ngreatly expanded or diffused by some means; and by what means could they\r\nbe so expanded but by heat?  Indeed, the existence of this central heat,\r\na residuum of that which kept all matter in a vaporiform chaos at first,\r\nis amongst the most solid discoveries of modern science, {42} and the\r\nsupport which it gives to Herschel’s explanation of the formation of\r\nworlds is most important.  We shall hereafter see what appear to be\r\ntraces of an operation of this heat upon the surface of the earth in very\r\nremote times; an effect, however, which has long passed entirely away.\r\nThe central heat has, for ages, reached a fixed point, at which it will\r\nprobably remain for ever, as the non-conducting quality of the cool crust\r\nabsolutely prevents it from suffering any diminution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH FORMED—ERA OF THE\r\nPRIMARY ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHOUGH the earth has not been actually penetrated to a greater depth\r\nthan three thousand feet, the nature of its substance can, in many\r\ninstances, be inferred for the depth of many miles by other means of\r\nobservation.  We see a mountain composed of a particular substance, with\r\nstrata, or beds of other rock, lying against its sloped sides; we, of\r\ncourse, infer that the substance of the mountain dips away under the\r\nstrata which we see lying against it.  Suppose that we walk away from the\r\nmountain across the turned up edges of the stratified rocks, and that for\r\nmany miles we continue to pass over other stratified rocks, all disposed\r\nin the same way, till by and bye we come to a place where we begin to\r\ncross the opposite edges of the same beds; after which we pass over these\r\nrocks all in reverse order till we come to another extensive mountain\r\ncomposed of similar material to the first, and shelving away under the\r\nstrata in the same way.  We should then infer that the stratified rocks\r\noccupied a basin formed by the rock of these two mountains, and by\r\ncalculating the thickness right through these strata, could be able to\r\nsay to what depth the rock of the mountain extended below.  By such\r\nmeans, the kind of rock existing many miles below the surface can often\r\nbe inferred with considerable confidence.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the globe has now been inspected in this way in many\r\nplaces, and a tolerably distinct notion of its general arrangements has\r\nconsequently been arrived at.  It appears that the basis rock of the\r\nearth, as it may be called, is of hard texture, and crystalline in its\r\nconstitution.  Of this rock, granite may be said to be the type, though\r\nit runs into many varieties.  Over this, except in the comparatively few\r\nplaces where it projects above the general level in mountains, other\r\nrocks are disposed in sheets or strata, with the appearance of having\r\nbeen deposited originally from water; but these last rocks have nowhere\r\nbeen allowed to rest in their original arrangement.  Uneasy movements\r\nfrom below have broken them up in great inclined masses, while in many\r\ncases there has been projected through the rents rocky matter more or\r\nless resembling the great inferior crystalline mass.  This rocky matter\r\nmust have been in a state of fusion from heat at the time of its\r\nprojection, for it is often found to have run into and filled up lateral\r\nchinks in these rents.  There are even instances where it has been rent\r\nagain, and a newer melted matter of the same character sent through the\r\nopening.  Finally, in the crust as thus arranged there are, in many\r\nplaces, chinks containing veins of metal.  Thus, there is first a great\r\ninferior mass, composed of crystalline rock, and probably resting\r\nimmediately on the fused and expanded matter of the interior: next,\r\nlayers or strata of aqueous origin; next, irregular masses of melted\r\ninferior rock that have been sent up volcanically and confusedly at\r\nvarious times amongst the aqueous rocks, breaking up these into masses,\r\nand tossing them out of their original levels.  This is an outline of the\r\narrangements of the crust of the earth, as far as we can observe it.  It\r\nis, at first sight, a most confused scene; but after some careful\r\nobservation, we readily detect in it a regularity and order from which\r\nmuch instruction in the history of our globe is to be derived.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of the aqueous rocks, and the projection of the volcanic,\r\nhave unquestionably taken place since the settlement of the earth in its\r\npresent form.  They are indeed of an order of events which we see going\r\non, under the agency of more or less intelligible causes, even down to\r\nthe present day.  We may therefore consider them generally as\r\ncomparatively recent transactions.  Abstracting them from the\r\ninvestigations before us, we arrive at the idea of the earth in its first\r\ncondition as a globe of its present size—namely, as a mass, externally at\r\nleast, consisting of the crystalline kind of rock, with the waters of the\r\npresent seas and the present atmosphere around it, though these were\r\nprobably in considerably different conditions, both as to temperature and\r\ntheir constituent materials, from what they now are.  We are thus to\r\npresume that that crystalline texture of rock which we see exemplified in\r\ngranite is the condition into which the great bulk of the solids of our\r\nearth were agglomerated directly from the nebulous or vaporiform state.\r\nIt is a condition eminently of combination, for such rock is invariably\r\ncomposed of two or more of four substances—silica, mica, quartz, and\r\nhornblende—which associate in it in the form of grains or crystals, and\r\nwhich are themselves each composed of a group of the simple or elementary\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nJudging from the results and from still remaining conditions, we must\r\nsuppose that the heat retained in the interior of the globe was more\r\nintense, or had greater freedom to act, in some places than in others.\r\nThese became the scenes of volcanic operations, and in time marked their\r\nsituations by the extrusion of traps and basalts from below—namely, rocks\r\ncomposed of the crystalline matter fused by intense heat, and developed\r\non the surface in various conditions, according to the particular\r\ncircumstances under which it was sent up; some, for example, being thrown\r\nup under water, and some in the open air, which conditions are found to\r\nhave made considerable difference in its texture and appearance.  The\r\ngreat stores of subterranean heat also served an important purpose in the\r\nformation of the aqueous rocks.  These rocks might, according to Sir John\r\nHerschel, become subject to heat in the following manner:—While the\r\nsurface of a particular mass of rock forms the bed of the sea, the heat\r\nis kept at a certain distance from that surface by the contact of the\r\nwater; philosophically speaking, it radiates away the heat into the sea,\r\nand (to resort to common language) is cooled a good way down.  But when\r\nnew sediment settles at the bottom of that sea, the heat rises up to what\r\nwas formerly the surface; and when a second quantity of sediment is laid\r\ndown, it continues to rise through the first of the deposits, which then\r\nbecomes subjected to those changes which heat is calculated to produce.\r\nThis process is precisely the same as that of putting additional coats\r\nupon our own bodies; when, of course, the internal heat rises through\r\neach coat in succession, and the third (supposing there is a fourth above\r\nit) becomes as warm as perhaps the first originally was.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of sedimentary rocks, we may be said to be anticipating.  It\r\nis necessary, first, to shew how such rocks were formed, or how\r\nstratification commenced.\r\n\r\nGeology tells us as plainly as possible, that the original crystalline\r\nmass was not a perfectly smooth ball, with air and water playing round\r\nit.  There were vast irregularities in the surface,—irregularities\r\ntrifling, perhaps, compared with the whole bulk of the globe, but\r\nassuredly vast in comparison with any which now exist upon it.  These\r\nirregularities might be occasioned by inequalities in the cooling of the\r\nsubstance, or by accidental and local sluggishness of the materials, or\r\nby local effects of the concentrated internal heat.  From whatever cause\r\nthey arose, there they were—enormous granitic mountains, interspersed\r\nwith seas which sunk to a depth equally profound, and by which, perhaps,\r\nthe mountains were wholly or partially covered.  Now, it is a fact of\r\nwhich the very first principles of geology assure us, that the solids of\r\nthe globe cannot for a moment be exposed to water, or to the atmosphere,\r\nwithout becoming liable to change.  They instantly begin to wear down.\r\nThis operation, we may be assured, proceeded with as much certainty in\r\nthe earliest ages of our earth’s history, as it does now, but upon a much\r\nmore magnificent scale.  There is the clearest evidence that the seas of\r\nthose days were not in some instances less than a hundred miles in depth,\r\nhowever much more.  The sub-aqueous mountains must necessarily have been\r\nof at least equal magnitude.  The system of disintegration consequent\r\nupon such conditions would be enormous.  The matters worn off, being\r\ncarried into the neighbouring depths, and there deposited, became the\r\ncomponents of the earliest stratified rocks, the first series of which is\r\nthe _Gneiss and Mica Slate System_, or series, examples of which are\r\nexposed to view in the Highlands of Scotland and in the West of England.\r\nThe vast thickness of these beds, in some instances, is what attests the\r\nprofoundness of the primeval oceans in which they were formed; the\r\nPensylvanian grawacke, a member of the next highest series, is not less\r\nthan a hundred miles in direct thickness.  We have also evidence that the\r\nearliest strata were formed in the presence of a stronger degree of heat\r\nthan what operated in subsequent stages of the world, for the laminæ of\r\nthe gneiss and of the mica and chlorite schists are contorted in a way\r\nwhich could only be the result of a very high temperature.  It appears as\r\nif the seas in which these deposits were formed, had been in the troubled\r\nstate of a caldron of water nearly at boiling heat.  Such a condition\r\nwould probably add not a little to the disintegrating power of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe earliest stratified rocks contain no matters which are not to be\r\nfound in the primitive granite.  They are the same in material, but only\r\nchanged into new forms and combinations; hence they have been called by\r\nMr. Lyell, metamorphic rocks.  But how comes it that some of them are\r\ncomposed almost exclusively of one of the materials of granite; the mica\r\nschists, for example, of mica—the quartz rocks, of quartz, &c.?  For this\r\nthere are both chemical and mechanical causes.  Suppose that a river has\r\na certain quantity of material to carry down, it is evident that it will\r\nsoonest drop the larger particles, and carry the lightest farthest on.\r\nTo such a cause is it owing that some of the materials of the worn-down\r\ngranite have settled in one place and some in another. {52}  Again, some\r\nof these materials must be presumed to have been in a state of chemical\r\nsolution in the primeval seas.  It would be, of course, in conformity\r\nwith chemical laws, that certain of these materials would be precipitated\r\nsingly, or in modified combinations, to the bottom, so as to form rocks\r\nby themselves.\r\n\r\nThe rocks hitherto spoken of contain none of those petrified remains of\r\nvegetables and animals which abound so much in subsequently formed rocks,\r\nand tell so wondrous a tale of the past history of our globe.  They\r\nsimply contain, as has been said, mineral materials derived from the\r\nprimitive mass, and which appear to have been formed into strata in seas\r\nof vast depth.  The absence from these rocks of all traces of vegetable\r\nand animal life, joined to a consideration of the excessive temperature\r\nwhich seems to have prevailed in their epoch, has led to the inference\r\nthat no plants or animals of any kind then existed.  A few geologists\r\nhave indeed endeavoured to shew that the absence of organic remains is no\r\nproof of the globe having been then unfruitful or uninhabited, as the\r\nheat to which these rocks have been subjected at the time of their\r\nsolidification, might have obliterated any remains of either plants or\r\nanimals which were included in them.  But this is only an hypothesis of\r\nnegation; and it certainly seems very unlikely that a degree of heat\r\nsufficient to obliterate the remains of plants or animals when dead,\r\nwould ever allow of their coming into or continuing in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF ORGANIC LIFE—\r\nSEA PLANTS, CORALS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE can scarcely be said to have passed out of these rocks, when we begin\r\nto find new conditions in the earth.  It is here to be observed that the\r\nsubsequent rocks are formed, in a great measure, of matters derived from\r\nthe substance of those which went before, but contain also beds of\r\nlimestone, which is to no small extent composed of an ingredient which\r\nhas not hitherto appeared.  Limestone is a carbonate of lime, a secondary\r\ncompound, of which one of the ingredients, carbonic acid gas, presents\r\nthe element _carbon_, a perfect novelty in our progress.  Whence this\r\nsubstance?  The question is the more interesting, from our knowing that\r\ncarbon is the main ingredient in organic things.  There is reason to\r\nbelieve that its primeval condition was that of a gas, confined in the\r\ninterior of the earth, and diffused in the atmosphere.  The atmosphere\r\nstill contains about a two-thousandth part of carbonic acid gas, forming\r\nthe grand store from which the substance of each year’s crop of herbage\r\nand grain is derived, passing from herbage and grain into animal\r\nsubstance, and from animals again rendered back to the atmosphere in\r\ntheir expired breath, so that its amount is never impaired.  Knowing\r\nthis, when we hear of carbon beginning to appear in the ascending series\r\nof rocks, we are unavoidably led to consider it as marking a time of some\r\nimportance in the earth’s history, a new era of natural conditions, one\r\nin which organic life has probably played a part.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to suppose that, at this period, carbon was adopted\r\ndirectly in its gaseous form into rocks; for, if so, why should it not\r\nhave been taken into earlier ones also?  But we know that plants take it\r\nin, and transform it into substance; and we also know that there are\r\nclasses of animals (marine polypes) which are capable of appropriating\r\nit, in connexion with lime, (carbonate of lime,) from the waters of the\r\nocean, provided it be there in solution; and this substance do these\r\nanimals deposit in masses (coral reefs) equal in extent to many strata.\r\nIt has even been suggested, on strong grounds of probability, that a\r\nclass of limestone beds are simply these reefs subjected to subsequent\r\nheat and pressure.\r\n\r\nThe appearance, then, of limestone beds in the early part of the\r\nstratified series, may be presumed to be connected with the fact of the\r\ncommencement of organic life upon our planet, and, indeed, a consequent\r\nand a symptom of it.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of place here to remark, that carbon is presumed to\r\nexist largely in the interior of the earth, from the fact of such\r\nconsiderable quantities of it issuing at this day, in the form of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, from fissures and springs.  The primeval and\r\nsubsequent history of this element is worthy of much attention, and we\r\nshall have to revert to it as a matter greatly concerning our subject.\r\nDelabeche estimates the quantity of carbonic acid gas locked up in every\r\ncubic yard of limestone, at 16,000 cubic feet.  The quantity locked up in\r\ncoal, in which it forms from 64 to 75 per cent., must also be enormous.\r\nIf all this were disengaged in a gaseous form, the constitution of the\r\natmosphere would undergo a change, of which the first effect would be the\r\nextinction of life in all land animals.  But a large proportion of it\r\nmust have at one time been in the atmosphere.  The atmosphere would then,\r\nof course, be incapable of supporting life in land animals.  It is\r\nimportant, however, to observe that such an atmosphere would not be\r\ninconsistent with a luxuriant land vegetation; for experiment has proved\r\nthat plants will flourish in air containing _one-twelfth_ of this gas, or\r\n166 times more than the present charge of our atmosphere.  The results\r\nwhich we observe are perfectly consistent with, and may be said to\r\npresuppose an atmosphere highly charged with this gas, from about the\r\nclose of the primary non-fossiliferous rocks to the termination of the\r\ncarboniferous series, for there we see vast deposits (coal) containing\r\ncarbon as a large ingredient, while at the same time the leaves of the\r\n_Stone Book_ present no record of the contemporaneous existence of land\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of the connexion of the first limestone beds with the\r\ncommencement of organic life upon our planet is supported by the fact,\r\nthat in these beds we find the first remains of the bodies of animated\r\ncreatures.  My hypothesis may indeed be unsound; but, whether or not, it\r\nis clear, taking organic remains as upon the whole a faithful chronicle,\r\nthat the deposition of these limestone beds was coeval with the existence\r\nof the earliest, or all but the earliest, living creatures upon earth.\r\n\r\nAnd what were those creatures?  It might well be with a kind of awe that\r\nthe uninstructed inquirer would wait for an answer to this question.  But\r\nnature is simpler than man’s wit would make her, and behold, the\r\ninterrogation only brings before us the unpretending forms of various\r\nzoophytes and polypes, together with a few single and double-valved\r\nshell-fish (mollusks), all of them creatures of the sea.  It is rather\r\nsurprising to find these before any vegetable forms, considering that\r\nvegetables appear to us as forming the necessary first link in the chain\r\nof nutrition; but it is probable that there were sea plants, and also\r\nsome simpler forms of animal life, before this period, although of too\r\nslight a substance to leave any fossil trace of their existence.\r\n\r\nThe exact point in the ascending stratified series at which the first\r\ntraces of organic life are to be found is not clearly determined.  Dr.\r\nM’Culloch states that he found fossil orthocerata (a kind of shell-fish)\r\nso early as the gneiss tract of Loch Eribol, in Sutherland; but Messrs.\r\nSedgwick and Murchison, on a subsequent search, could not verify the\r\ndiscovery.  It has also been stated, that the gneiss and mica tract of\r\nBohemia contains some seams of grawacke, in which are organic remains;\r\nbut British geologists have not as yet attached much importance to this\r\nstatement.  We have to look a little higher in the series for indubitable\r\ntraces of organic life.\r\n\r\nAbove the gneiss and mica slate system, or group of strata, is the _Clay\r\nSlate and Grawacke Slate System_; that is to say, it is higher in the\r\n_order of supraposition_, though very often it rests immediately on the\r\nprimitive granite.  The sub-groups of this system are in the following\r\nsuccession upwards:—1, hornblende slate; 2, chiastolite slate; 3, clay\r\nslate; 4, Snowdon rocks, (grawacke and conglomerates;) 5, Bala limestone;\r\n6, Plynlymmon rocks, (grawacke and grawacke slates, with beds of\r\nconglomerates.)  This system is largely developed in the west and north\r\nof England, and it has been well examined, partly because some of the\r\nslate beds are extensively quarried for domestic purposes.  If we\r\noverlook the dubious statements respecting Sutherland and Bohemia, we\r\nhave in this “system” the first appearances of life upon our planet.  The\r\nanimal remains are chiefly confined to the slate beds, those named from\r\nBala, in Wales, being the most prolific.  _Zoophyta_, _polyparia_,\r\n_crinoidea_, _conchifera_, and _crustacea_, {60} are the orders of the\r\nanimal kingdom thus found in the earliest of earth’s sepulchres.  The\r\n_orders_ are distinguished without difficulty, from the general\r\ncharacters of the creatures whose remains are found; but it is only in\r\nthis general character that they bear a general resemblance to any\r\ncreatures now existing.  When we come to consider specific characters, we\r\nsee that a difference exists—that, in short, the species and even genera\r\nare no longer represented upon earth.  More than this, it will be found\r\nthat the earliest species comparatively soon gave place to others, and\r\nthat they are not represented even in the next higher group of rocks.\r\nOne important remark has been made, that a comparatively small variety of\r\nspecies is found in the older rocks, although of some particular ones the\r\nremains are very abundant; as, for instance, of a species of asaphus,\r\nwhich is found between the laminæ of some of the slate rocks of Wales,\r\nand the corresponding rocks of Normandy and Germany in enormous\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nAscending to the next group of rocks, we find the traces of life become\r\nmore abundant, the number of species extended, and important additions\r\nmade in certain vestiges of fuci, or sea-plants, and of fishes.  This\r\ngroup of rocks has been called by English geologists, the _Silurian\r\nSystem_, because largely developed at the surface of a district of\r\nwestern England, formerly occupied by a people whom the Roman historians\r\ncall Silures.  It is a series of sandstones, limestones, and beds of\r\nshale (hardened mud), which are classed in the following sub-groups,\r\nbeginning with the undermost:—1, Llandillo rocks, (darkish calcareous\r\nflagstones;) 2 and 3, two groups called Caradoc rocks; 4, Wenlock shale;\r\n5, Wenlock limestone; 6, Lower Ludlow rocks, (shales and limestones;) 7,\r\nAymestry limestone; 8, Upper Ludlow rocks, (shales and limestone, chiefly\r\nmicaceous.)  From the lowest beds upwards, there are polypiaria, though\r\nmost prevalent in the Wenlock limestone; conchifera, a vast number of\r\ngenera, but all of the order brachiopoda, (including terebratula,\r\npentamerus, spirifer, orthis, leptæna;) mollusca, of several orders and\r\nmany genera, (including turritella, orthoceras, nautilus, bellerophon;)\r\ncrustacea, all of them trilobites, (including trinucleus, asaphus,\r\ncalamene.)  A little above the Llandillo rocks, there have been\r\ndiscovered certain convoluted forms, which are now established as\r\nannelids, or sea-worms, a tribe of creatures still existing, (nereidina\r\nand serpulina,) and which may often be found beneath stones on a\r\nsea-beach.  One of these, figured by Mr. Murchison, is furnished with\r\nfeet in vast numbers all along its body, like a centipede.  The\r\noccurrence of annelids is important, on account of their character and\r\nstatus in the animal kingdom.  They are red-blooded and hermaphrodite,\r\nand form a link of connexion between the annulosa (white-blooded worms)\r\nand a humble class of the vertebrata. {62}  The Wenlock limestone is most\r\nremarkable amongst all the rocks of the Silurian system, for organic\r\nremains.  Many slabs of it are wholly composed of corals, shells, and\r\ntrilobites, held together by shale.  It contains many genera of crinoidea\r\nand polypiaria, and it is thought that some beds of it are wholly the\r\nproduction of the latter creatures, or are, in other words, coral reefs\r\ntransformed by heat and pressure into rocks.  Remains of fishes, of a\r\nvery minute size, have been detected by Mr. Philips in the Aymestry\r\nlimestone, being apparently the first examples of vertebrated animals\r\nwhich breathed upon our planet.  In the upper Ludlow rocks, remains of\r\nsix genera of fish have been for a longer period known; they belong to\r\nthe order of cartilaginous fishes, an order of mean organization and\r\nferocious habits, of which the shark and sturgeon are living specimens.\r\n“Some were furnished with long palates, and squat, firmly-based teeth,\r\nwell adapted for crushing the strong-cased zoophytes and shells of the\r\nperiod, fragments of which occur in the fœcal remains; some with teeth\r\nthat, like the fossil sharks of the later formations, resemble lines of\r\nminiature pyramids, larger and smaller alternating; some with teeth\r\nsharp, thin, and so deeply serrated, that every individual tooth\r\nresembles a row of poniards set up against the walls of an armory; and\r\nthese last, says Agassiz, furnished with weapons so murderous, must have\r\nbeen the pirates of the period.  Some had their fins guarded with long\r\nspines, hooked like the beak of an eagle; some with spines of straighter\r\nand more slender form, and ribbed and furrowed longitudinally like\r\ncolumns; some were shielded by an armour of bony points, and some thickly\r\ncovered with glistening scales.” {64}\r\n\r\nThe traces of fuci in this system are all but sufficient to allow of a\r\ndistinction of genera.  In some parts of North America, extensive though\r\nthin beds of them have been found.  A distinguished French geologist, M.\r\nBrogniart, has shewn that all existing marine plants are classifiable\r\nwith regard to the zones of climate; some being fitted for the torrid\r\nzone, some for the temperate, some for the frigid.  And he establishes\r\nthat the fuci of these early rocks speak of a torrid climate, although\r\nthey may be found in what are now temperate regions; he also states that\r\nthose of the higher rocks betoken, as we ascend, a gradually diminishing\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nWe thus early begin to find proofs of the general uniformity of organic\r\nlife over the surface of the earth, at the time when each particular\r\nsystem of rocks was formed.  Species identical with the remains in the\r\nWenlock limestone occur in the corresponding class of rocks in the Eifel,\r\nand partially in the Harz, Norway, Russia, and Brittany.  The situations\r\nof the remains in Russia are fifteen hundred miles from the Wenlock beds;\r\nbut at the distance of between six and seven thousand from those,—namely,\r\nin the vale of Mississippi, the same species are discovered.  Uniformity\r\nin animal life over large geographical areas argues uniformity in the\r\nconditions of animal life; and hence arise some curious inferences.\r\nSpecies, in the same low class of animals, are now much more limited; for\r\ninstance, the Red Sea gives different polypiaria, zoophytes, and\r\nshell-fish, from the Mediterranean.  It is the opinion of M. Brogniart,\r\nthat the uniformity which existed in the primeval times can only be\r\nattributed to the temperature arising from the internal heat, which had\r\nyet, as he supposes, been sufficiently great to overpower the ordinary\r\nmeteorological influences, and spread a tropical clime all over the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF THE OLD RED SANDSTONE—\r\nFISHES ABUNDANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE advance to a new chapter in this marvellous history—the era of the\r\n_Old Red Sandstone System_.  This term has been recently applied to a\r\nseries of strata, of enormous thickness in the whole mass, largely\r\ndeveloped in Herefordshire, Shropshire, Worcestershire, and South Wales;\r\nalso in the counties of Fife, Forfar, Moray, Cromarty, and Caithness; and\r\nin Russia and North America, if not in many other parts of the world.\r\nThe particular strata forming the system are somewhat different in\r\ndifferent countries; but there is a general character to the extent of\r\nthese being a mixture of flagstones, marly rocks, and sandstones, usually\r\nof a laminous structure, with conglomerates.  There is also a schist\r\nshewing the presence of bitumen; a remarkable new ingredient, since it is\r\na vegetable production.  In the conglomerates, of great extent and\r\nthickness, which form, in at least one district, the basis or leading\r\nfeature of the system, inclosing water-worn fragments of quartz and other\r\nrocks, we have evidence of the seas of that period having been subjected\r\nto a violent and long-continued agitation, probably from volcanic causes.\r\nThe upper members of the series bear the appearance of having been\r\ndeposited in comparatively tranquil seas.  The English specimens of this\r\nsystem shew a remarkable freedom from those disturbances which result in\r\nthe interjection of trap; and they are thus defective in mineral ores.\r\nIn some parts of England the old red sandstone system has been stated as\r\n10,000 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nIn this era, the forms of life which existed in the Silurian are\r\ncontinued: we have the same orders of marine creatures, zoophyta,\r\npolypiaria, conchifera, crustacea; but to these are added numerous\r\nfishes, some of which are of most extraordinary and surprising forms.\r\nSeveral of the strata are crowded with remains of fish, shewing that the\r\nseas in which those beds were deposited had swarmed with that class of\r\ninhabitants.  The investigation of this system is recent; but already\r\n{68} M. Agassiz has ascertained about twenty genera, and thrice the\r\nnumber of species.  And it is remarkable that the Silurian fishes are\r\nhere only represented in genera; the whole of the _species_ of that era\r\nhad already passed away.  Even throughout the sub-groups of the system\r\nitself, the species are changed; and these are phenomena observed\r\nthroughout all the subsequent systems or geological eras; apparently\r\narguing that, during the deposition of all the rocks, a gradual change of\r\nphysical conditions was constantly going on.  A varying temperature, or\r\neven a varying depth of sea, would at present be attended with similar\r\nchanges in marine life; and by analogy we are entitled to assume that\r\nsuch variations in the ancient seas might be amongst the causes of that\r\nconstant change of genera and species in the inhabitants of those seas to\r\nwhich the organic contents of the rocks bear witness.\r\n\r\nSome of the fossils of this system,—the cephalaspis, coccosteus,\r\npterichthys, holoptychius—are, in form and structure, entirely different\r\nfrom any fishes now existing, only the sturgeon family having any trace\r\nof affinity to them in any respect.  They seem to form a sort of\r\nconnecting link between the crustacea and true fishes.\r\n\r\nThe _cephalaspis_ may be considered as making the smallest advance from\r\nthe crustacean character; it very much resembles in form the asaphus of\r\nlower formations, having a longish tail-like body inserted within the\r\ncusp of a large crescent-shaped head, somewhat like a saddler’s\r\ncutting-knife.  The body is covered with strong plates of bone,\r\nenamelled, and the head was protected on the upper side with one large\r\nplate, as with a buckler—hence the name, implying _buckler-head_.  A\r\nrange of small fins conveys the idea of its having been as weak in motion\r\nas it is strong in structure.  The _coccosteus_ may be said to mark the\r\nnext advance to fish creation.  The outline of its body is of the form of\r\na short thick coffin, rounded, covered with strong bony plates, and\r\nterminating in a long tail, which seems to have been the sole organ of\r\nmotion.  It is very remarkable, that, while the tail establishes this\r\ncreature among the vertebrata and the fishes, its mouth has been opened\r\nvertically, like those of the crustaceans, but which is contrary to the\r\nmode of vertebrata generally.  This seems a pretty strong mark of the\r\nlink character of the coccosteus between these two great departments of\r\nthe animal kingdom.  The _pterichthys_ has also strong bony plates over\r\nits body, arranged much like those of a tortoise, and has a long tail;\r\nbut its most remarkable feature, and that which has suggested its name,\r\nis a pair of long and narrow wing-like appendages attached to the\r\nshoulders, which the creature is supposed to have erected for its defence\r\nwhen attacked by an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe _holoptychius_ is of a flat oval form, furnished with fins, and\r\nending in a long tail; the whole body covered with strong plates which\r\noverlap each other, and the head forming only a slight rounded projection\r\nfrom the general figure.  The specimens in the lower beds are not above\r\nthe size of a flounder; but in the higher strata, to judge by the size of\r\nthe scales or plates which have been found, the creature attained a\r\ncomparatively monstrous size.\r\n\r\nThe other fishes of the system,—the osteolepis, glyptolepis, dipterus,\r\n&c., are, in general outline, much like fishes still existing, but their\r\norganization has, nevertheless, some striking peculiarities.  They have\r\nbeen entirely covered with bony scales or plates, enamelled externally;\r\ntheir spines are tipped with bone, and, as one striking and unvarying\r\nfeature, the tail is only finned on the lower side.  The internal\r\nskeleton, of which no traces have been preserved, is presumed to have\r\nbeen cartilaginous.  They therefore unite the character of cartilaginous\r\nfishes with a character peculiar to themselves, and in which we see\r\npretty clear vestiges of the pre-existent crustaceous form.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the link character of these animals, some curious facts\r\nare mentioned.  It appears that in the imperfect condition of the\r\nvertebral column, and the inferior situation of the mouth in the\r\npterichthys, coccosteus, &c., there is an analogy to the form of the\r\ndorsal cord and position of the mouth in the embryo of perfect fishes.\r\nThe one-sided form of the tail in the osteolepis &c. finds a similar\r\nanalogy in the form of the tail in the embryo of the salmon.  It is not\r\npremature to remark how broadly these facts seem to hint at a parity of\r\nlaw affecting the progress of general creation, and the progress of an\r\nindividual fœtus of one of the more perfect animals.\r\n\r\nIt is equally ascertained of the types of being prevalent in the old red,\r\nas of those of the preceding system, that they are uniform in the\r\ncorresponding strata of distant parts of the earth; for instance, Russia\r\nand North America.\r\n\r\nIn the old red sandstone, the marine plants, of which faint traces are\r\nobservable in the Silurians, continue to appear.  It would seem as if\r\nless change took place in the vegetation than in the animals of those\r\nearly seas; and for this, as Mr. Miller has remarked, it is easy to\r\nimagine reasons.  For example, an infusion of lime into the sea would\r\ndestroy animal life, but be favourable to vegetation.\r\n\r\nAs yet there were no land animals or plants, and for this the presumable\r\nreason is, that no dry land as yet existed.  We are not left to make this\r\ninference solely from the absence of land animals and plants; in the\r\narrangement of the primary (stratified) rocks, we have further evidence\r\nof it.  That these rocks were formed in a generally horizontal position,\r\nwe are as well assured as that they were formed at the bottom of seas.\r\nBut they are always found greatly inclined in position, tilted up against\r\nthe slopes of the granitic masses which are beneath them in geological\r\norder, though often shooting up to a higher point in the atmosphere.  No\r\ndoubt can be entertained that these granitic masses, forming our\r\nprincipal mountain ranges, have been protruded from below, or, at least,\r\nthrust much further up, _since_ the deposition of the primary rocks.  The\r\nprotrusion was what tilted up the primary rocks; and the inference is, of\r\ncourse, unavoidable, that these mountains have risen chiefly, at least,\r\nsince the primary rocks were laid down.  It is remarkable that, while the\r\nprimary rocks thus incline towards granitic nuclei or axes, the strata\r\nhigher in the series rest against these again, generally at a less\r\ninclination, or none at all, shewing that these strata were laid down\r\nafter the swelling mountain eminences had, by their protrusion, tilted up\r\nthe primary strata.  And thus it may be said an era of local upthrowing\r\nof the primitive and (perhaps) central matter of our planet, is\r\nestablished as happening about the close of the primary strata, and\r\nbeginning of the next ensuing system.  It may be called the _Era of the\r\nOldest Mountains_, or, more boldly, of the formation of the detached\r\nportions of dry land over the hitherto watery surface of the globe—an\r\nimportant part of the designs of Providence, for which the time was now\r\napparently come.  It may be remarked, that volcanic disturbances and\r\nprotrusions of trap took place throughout the whole period of the\r\ndeposition of the primary rocks; but they were upon a comparatively\r\nlimited scale, and probably all took place under water.  It was only now\r\nthat the central granitic masses of the great mountain ranges were thrown\r\nup, carrying up with them broken edges of the primary strata; a process\r\nwhich seems to have had this difference from the other, that it was the\r\neffect of a more tremendous force exerted at a lower depth in the earth,\r\nand generally acting in lines pervading a considerable portion of the\r\nearth’s surface.  We shall by-and-by see that the protrusion of some of\r\nthe mountain ranges was not completed, or did not stop, at that period.\r\nThere is no part of geological science more clear than that which refers\r\nto the ages of mountains.  It is as certain that the Grampian mountains\r\nof Scotland are older than the Alps and Apennines, as it is that\r\ncivilization had visited Italy, and had enabled her to subdue the world,\r\nwhile Scotland was the residence of “roving barbarians.”  The Pyrenees,\r\nCarpathians, and other ranges of continental Europe, are all younger than\r\nthe Grampians, or even the insignificant Mendip Hills of southern\r\nEngland.  Stratification tells this tale as plainly as Livy tells the\r\nhistory of the Roman republic.  It tells us—to use the words of Professor\r\nPhilips—that at the time when the Grampians sent streams and detritus to\r\nstraits where now the valleys of the Forth and Clyde meet, the greater\r\npart of Europe was a wide ocean.\r\n\r\nThe last three systems—called, in England, the Cumbrian, Silurian, and\r\nDevonian, and collectively the palæozoic rocks, from their containing the\r\nremains of the earliest inhabitants of the globe—are of vast thickness;\r\nin England, not much less than 30,000 feet, or nearly six miles.  In\r\nother parts of the world, as we have seen, the earliest of these systems\r\nalone is of much greater depth—arguing an enormous profundity in the\r\nocean in which they were formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY ROCKS.\r\nERA OF THE CARBONIFEROUS FORMATION.\r\nLAND FORMED.\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF LAND PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE now enter upon a new great epoch in the history of our globe.  There\r\nwas now dry land.  As a consequence of this fact, there was fresh water,\r\nfor rain, instead of immediately returning to the sea, as formerly, was\r\nnow gathered in channels of the earth, and became springs, rivers, and\r\nlakes.  There was now a theatre for the existence of land plants and\r\nanimals, and it remains to be inquired if these accordingly were\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary Rocks, in which our further researches are to be\r\nprosecuted, consist of a great and varied series, resting, generally\r\nunconformably, against flanks of the upturned primary rocks, sometimes\r\nthemselves considerably inclined, at others, forming extensive basin-like\r\nbeds, nearly horizontal; in many places, much broken up and shifted by\r\ndisturbances from below.  They have all been formed out of the materials\r\nof the older rocks, by virtue of the wearing power of air and water,\r\nwhich is still every day carrying down vast quantities of the elevated\r\nmatter of the globe into the sea.  But the separate strata are each much\r\nmore distinct in the matter of its composition than might be expected.\r\nSome are siliceous or arenaceous (sandstones), composed mainly of fine\r\ngrains from the quartz rocks—the most abundant of the primary strata.\r\nOthers are argillaceous—clays, shales, &c., chiefly derived, probably,\r\nfrom the slate beds of the primary series.  Others are calcareous,\r\nderived from the early limestone.  As a general feature, they are softer\r\nand less crystalline than the primary rocks, as if they had endured less\r\nof both heat and pressure than the senior formation.  There are beds\r\n(_coal_) formed solely of vegetable matter, and some others in which the\r\nmain ingredient is particles of iron, (_the iron black band_.)  The\r\nsecondary rocks are quite as communicative with regard to their portion\r\nof the earth’s history as the primitive were.\r\n\r\nThe first, or lowest, group of the secondary rocks is called the\r\n_Carboniferous Formation_, from the remarkable feature of its numerous\r\ninterspersed beds of coal.  It commences with the beds of the _mountain\r\nlimestone_, which, in some situations, as in Derbyshire and Ireland, are\r\nof great thickness, being alternated with chert (a siliceous sandstone),\r\nsandstones, shales, and beds of coal, generally of the harder and less\r\nbituminous kind (_anthracite_), the whole being covered in some places by\r\nthe millstone grit, a siliceous conglomerate composed of the detritus of\r\nthe primary rocks.  The mountain limestone, attaining in England to a\r\ndepth of eight hundred yards, greatly exceeds in volume any of the\r\nprimary limestone beds, and shews an enormous addition of power to the\r\ncauses formerly suggested as having produced this substance.  In fact,\r\nremains of corals, crinoidea, and shells, are so abundant in it, as to\r\ncompose three-fourths of the mass in some parts.  Above the mountain\r\nlimestone commence the more conspicuous _coal beds_, alternating with\r\nsandstones, shales, beds of limestone, and ironstone.  Coal is altogether\r\ncomposed of the matter of a terrestrial vegetation, transmuted by\r\npressure.  Some fresh-water shells have been found in it, but few of\r\nmarine origin, and no remains of those zoophytes and crinoidea so\r\nabundant in the mountain limestone and other rocks.  Coal beds exist in\r\nEurope, Asia, and America, and have hitherto been esteemed as the most\r\nvaluable of mineral productions, from the important services which the\r\nsubstance renders in manufactures and in domestic economy.  It is to be\r\nremarked, that there are some local variations in the arrangement of coal\r\nbeds.  In France, they rest immediately on the granite and other primary\r\nrocks, the intermediate strata not having been found at those places.  In\r\nAmerica, the kind called anthracite occurs among the slate beds, and this\r\nspecies also abounds more in the mountain limestone than with us.  These\r\nlast circumstances only shew that different parts of the earth’s surface\r\ndid not all witness the same events of a certain fixed series exactly at\r\nthe same time.  There had been an exhibition of dry land about the site\r\nof America, a little earlier than in Europe.\r\n\r\nSome features of the condition of the earth during the deposition of the\r\ncarboniferous group, are made out with a clearness which must satisfy\r\nmost minds.  First we are told of a time when carbonate of lime was\r\nformed in vast abundance at the bottoms of profound seas, accompanied by\r\nan unusually large population of corals and encrinites; while in some\r\nparts of the earth there were patches of dry land, covered with a\r\nluxuriant vegetation.  Next we have a comparatively brief period of\r\nvolcanic disturbance, (when the conglomerate was formed.)  Then the\r\ncauses favourable to the so abundant production of limestone, and the\r\nlarge population of marine acrita, decline, and we find the masses of dry\r\nland increase in number and extent, and begin to bear an amount of forest\r\nvegetation, far exceeding that of the most sheltered tropical spots of\r\nthe present surface.  The climate, even in the latitude of Baffin’s Bay,\r\nwas torrid, and perhaps the atmosphere contained a larger charge of\r\ncarbonic acid gas (the material of vegetation) than it now does.  The\r\nforests or thickets of the period, included no species of plants now\r\nknown upon earth.  They mainly consisted of gigantic shrubs, which are\r\neither not represented by any existing types, or are akin to kinds which\r\nare now only found in small and lowly forms.  That these forests grew\r\nupon a Polynesia, or multitude of small islands, is considered probable,\r\nfrom similar vegetation being now found in such situations within the\r\ntropics.  With regard to the circumstances under which the masses of\r\nvegetable matter were transformed into successive coal strata, geologists\r\nare divided.  From examples seen at the present day, at the mouths of\r\nsuch rivers as the Mississippi, which traverse extensive sylvan regions,\r\nand from other circumstances to be adverted to, it is held likely by some\r\nthat the vegetable matter, the rubbish of decayed forests, was carried by\r\nrivers into estuaries, and there accumulated in vast natural rafts, until\r\nit sunk to the bottom, where an overlayer of sand or mud would prepare it\r\nfor becoming a stratum of coal.  Others conceive that the vegetation\r\nfirst went into the condition of a peat moss, that a sink in the level\r\nthen exposed it to be overrun by the sea, and covered with a layer of\r\nsand or mud; that a subsequent uprise made the mud dry land, and fitted\r\nit to bear a new forest, which afterwards, like its predecessor, became a\r\nbed of peat; that, in short, by repetitions of this process, the\r\nalternate layers of coal, sandstone, and shale, constituting the\r\ncarboniferous group, were formed.  It is favourable to this last view\r\nthat marine fossils are scarcely found in the body of the coal itself,\r\nthough abundant in the shale layers above and below it; also that in\r\nseveral places erect stems of trees are found with their roots still\r\nfixed in the shale beds, and crossing the sandstone beds at almost right\r\nangles, shewing that these, at least, had not been drifted from their\r\noriginal situations.  On the other hand, it is not easy to admit such\r\nrepeated risings and sinkings of surface as would be required, on this\r\nhypothesis, to form a series of coal strata.  Perhaps we may most safely\r\nrest at present with the supposition that coal has been formed under both\r\nclasses of circumstances, though in the latter only as an exception to\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nUpwards of three hundred species of plants have been ascertained to exist\r\nin the coal formation; but it is not necessary to suppose that the whole\r\ncontained in that system are now, or ever will be distinguished.\r\nExperiments shew that some great classes of plants become decomposed in\r\nwater in a much less space of time than others, and it is remarkable that\r\nthose which decompose soonest, are of the classes found most rare, or not\r\nat all, in the coal strata.  It is consequently to be inferred that there\r\nmay have been grasses and mosses at this era, and many species of trees,\r\nthe remains of which had lost all trace of organic form before their\r\nsubstance sunk into the mass of which coal was formed.  In speaking,\r\ntherefore, of the vegetation of this period, we must bear in mind that it\r\nmay have comprehended forms of which we have no memorial.\r\n\r\nSupposing, nevertheless, that, in the main, the ascertained vegetation of\r\nthe coal system is that which grew at the time of its formation, it is\r\ninteresting to find that the terrestrial botany of our globe begins with\r\nclasses of comparatively simple forms and structure.  In the ranks of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, the lowest place is taken by plants of cellular\r\ntissue, and which have no flowers, (_cryptogamia_,) as lichens, mosses,\r\nfungi, ferns, sea-weeds.  Above these stand plants of vascular tissue,\r\nand bearing flowers, in which again there are two great subdivisions;\r\nfirst, plants having one seed-lobe, (_monocotyledons_,) and in which the\r\nnew matter is added within, (_endogenous_,) of which the cane and palm\r\nare examples; second, plants having two seed-lobes, (_dicotyledons_,) and\r\nin which the new matter is added on the outside under the bark,\r\n(_exogenous_,) of which the pine, elm, oak, and most of the British\r\nforest-trees are examples; these subdivisions also ranking in the order\r\nin which they are here stated.  Now it is clear that a predominance of\r\nthese forms in succession marked the successive epochs developed by\r\nfossil geology; the simple abounding first, and the complex afterwards.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of the plants of the carboniferous era are of the cellular or\r\ncryptogamic kind, a proportion which would probably be much increased if\r\nwe knew the whole Flora of that era.  The ascertained dicotyledons, or\r\nhigher-class plants, are comparatively few in this formation; but it will\r\nbe found that they constantly increased as the globe grew older.\r\n\r\nThe master-form or type of the era was the _fern_, or breckan, of which\r\nabout one hundred and thirty species have already been ascertained as\r\nentering into the composition of coal. {84a}  The fern is a plant which\r\nthrives best in warm, shaded, and moist situations.  In tropical\r\ncountries, where these conditions abound, there are many more species\r\nthan in temperate climes, and some of these are arborescent, or of a\r\ntree-like size and luxuriance. {84b}  The ferns of the coal strata have\r\nbeen of this magnitude, and that without regard to the parts of the earth\r\nwhere they are found.  In the coal of Baffin’s Bay, of Newcastle, and of\r\nthe torrid zone alike, are the fossil ferns arborescent, shewing clearly\r\nthat, in that era, the present tropical temperature, or one even higher,\r\nexisted in very high latitudes.\r\n\r\nIn the swamps and ditches of England there grows a plant called the\r\nhorse-tail (_equisetum_), having a succulent, erect, jointed stem, with\r\nslender leaves, and a scaly catkin at the top.  A second large section of\r\nthe plants of the carboniferous era were of this kind (_equisetaceæ_),\r\nbut, like the fern, reaching the magnitudes of trees.  While existing\r\nequiseta rarely exceed three feet in height, and the stems are generally\r\nunder half an inch in diameter, their kindred, entombed in the coal beds,\r\nseem to have been generally fourteen or fifteen feet high, with stems\r\nfrom six inches to a foot in thickness.  Arborescent plants of this\r\nfamily, like the arborescent ferns, now grow only in tropical countries,\r\nand their being found in the coal beds in all latitudes is consequently\r\nheld as an additional proof, that at this era a warm climate was extended\r\nmuch farther to the north than at present.  It is to be remarked that\r\nplants of this kind (forming two genera, the most abundant of which is\r\nthe _calamites_) are only represented on the present surface by plants of\r\nthe same _family_: the _species_ which flourished at this era gradually\r\nlessen in number as we advance upwards in the series of rocks, and\r\ndisappear before we arrive at the tertiary formation.\r\n\r\nThe club-moss family (_lycopodiaceæ_) are other plants of the present\r\nsurface, usually seen in a lowly and creeping form in temperate\r\nlatitudes, but presenting species which rise to a greater magnitude\r\nwithin the tropics.  Many specimens of this family are found in the coal\r\nbeds; it is thought they have contributed more to the substance of the\r\ncoal than any other family.  But, like the ferns and equisetaceæ, they\r\nrise to a prodigious magnitude.  The lepidodendra (so the fossil genus is\r\ncalled) have probably been from sixty-five to eighty feet in height,\r\nhaving at their base a diameter of about three feet, while their leaves\r\nmeasured twenty inches in length.  In the forests of the coal era, the\r\nlepidodendra would enjoy the rank of firs in our forests, affording shade\r\nto the only less stately ferns and calamites.  The internal structure of\r\nthe stem, and the character of the seed-vessels, shew them to have been a\r\nlink between single-lobed and double-lobed plants, a fact worthy of note,\r\nas it favours the idea that, in vegetable, as well as animal creation, a\r\nprogress has been observed, in conformity with advancing conditions.  It\r\nis also curious to find a missing link of so much importance in a genus\r\nof plants which has long ceased to have a living place upon earth.\r\n\r\nThe other leading plants of the coal era are without representatives on\r\nthe present surface, and their characters are in general less clearly\r\nascertained.  Amongst the most remarkable are—the _sigillaria_, of which\r\nlarge stems are very abundant, shewing that the interior has been soft,\r\nand the exterior fluted with separate leaves inserted in vertical rows\r\nalong the flutings—and the _stigmaria_, plants apparently calculated to\r\nflourish in marshes or pools, having a short, thick, fleshy stem, with a\r\ndome-shaped top, from which sprung branches of from twenty to thirty feet\r\nlong.  Amongst monocotyledons were some palms, (_flabellaria_ and\r\n_næggerathia_,) besides a few not distinctly assignable to any class.\r\n\r\nThe dicotyledons of the coal are comparatively few, though on the present\r\nsurface they are the most numerous sub-class.  Besides some of doubtful\r\naffinity, (_annularia_, _asterophyllites_, &c.,) there were a few of the\r\npine family, which seem to have been the highest class of trees of this\r\nera, and are only as yet found in isolated cases, and in sandstone beds.\r\nThe first discovered lay in the Craigleith quarry, near Edinburgh, and\r\nconsisted of a stem about two feet thick, and forty-seven feet in length.\r\nOthers have since been found, both in the same situation, and at\r\nNewcastle.  Leaves and fruit being wanting, an ingenious mode of\r\ndetecting the nature of these trees was hit upon by Mr. Witham of\r\nLartington.  Taking thin polished cross slices of the stem, and\r\nsubjecting them to the microscope, he detected the structure of the wood\r\nto be that of a cone-bearing tree, by the presence of certain\r\n“reticulations” which distinguish that family, in addition to the usual\r\nradiating and concentric lines.  That particular tree was concluded to be\r\nan araucaria, a species now found in Norfolk Island, in the South Sea,\r\nand in a few other remote situations.  The coniferæ of this era form the\r\ndawn of dicotyledenous trees, of which they may be said to be the\r\nsimplest type, and to which, it has already been noticed, the\r\nlepidodendra are a link from the monocotyledons.  The concentric rings of\r\nthe Craigleith and other coniferæ of this era have been mentioned.  It is\r\ninteresting to find in these a record of the changing seasons of those\r\nearly ages, when as yet there were no human beings to observe time or\r\ntide.  They are clearly traced; but it is observed that they are more\r\nslightly marked than is the case with their family at the present day, as\r\nif the changes of temperature had been within a narrower range.\r\n\r\nSuch was the vegetation of the carbonigenous era, composed of forms at\r\nthe bottom of the botanical scale, flowerless, fruitless, but luxuriant\r\nand abundant beyond what the most favoured spots on earth can now shew.\r\nThe rigidity of the leaves of its plants, and the absence of fleshy\r\nfruits and farinaceous seeds, unfitted it to afford nutriment to animals;\r\nand, monotonous in its forms, and destitute of brilliant colouring, its\r\nsward probably unenlivened by any of the smaller flowering herbs, its\r\nshades uncheered by the hum of insects, or the music of birds, it must\r\nhave been but a sombre scene to a human visitant.  But neither man nor\r\nany other animals were then in existence to look for such uses or such\r\nbeauties in this vegetation.  It was serving other and equally important\r\nends, clearing (probably) the atmosphere of matter noxious to animal\r\nlife, and storing up mineral masses which were in long subsequent ages to\r\nprove of the greatest service to the human race, even to the extent of\r\nfavouring the progress of its civilization.\r\n\r\nThe animal remains of this era are not numerous, in comparison with those\r\nwhich go before, or those which come after.  The mountain limestone,\r\nindeed, deposited at the commencement of it, abounds unusually in\r\npolypiaria and crinoidea; but when we ascend to the coal-beds themselves,\r\nthe case is altered, and these marine remains altogether disappear.  We\r\nhave then only a limited variety of conchifers and shell mollusks, with\r\nfragments of a few species of fishes, and these are rarely or never found\r\nin the coal seams, but in the shales alternating with them.  Some of the\r\nfishes are of a sauroid character, that is, partake of the nature of the\r\nlizard, a genus of the reptilia, a land class of animals, so that we may\r\nbe said here to have the first approach to a kind of animals calculated\r\nto breathe the atmosphere.  Such is the Megalichthys Hibbertii, found by\r\nDr. Hibbert Ware, in a limestone bed of fresh-water origin, underneath\r\nthe coal at Burdiehouse, near Edinburgh.  Others of the same kind have\r\nbeen found in the coal measures in Yorkshire, and in the low coal shales\r\nat Manchester.  This is no more than might be expected, as collections of\r\nfresh water now existed, and it is presumable that they would be peopled.\r\nThe chief other fishes of the coal era are named palæothrissum,\r\npalæoniscus, diperdus.\r\n\r\nCoal strata are nearly confined to the group termed the carboniferous\r\nformation.  Thin beds are not unknown afterwards, but they occur only as\r\na rare exception.  It is therefore thought that the most important of the\r\nconditions which allowed of so abundant a terrestrial vegetation, had\r\nceased about the time when this formation was closed.  The high\r\ntemperature was not one of the conditions which terminated, for there are\r\nevidences of it afterwards; but probably the superabundance of carbonic\r\nacid gas supposed to have existed during this era was expended before its\r\nclose.  There can be little doubt that the infusion of a large dose of\r\nthis gas into the atmosphere at the present day would be attended by\r\nprecisely the same circumstances as in the time of the carboniferous\r\nformation.  Land animal life would not have a place on earth; vegetation\r\nwould be enormous; and coal strata would be formed from the vast\r\naccumulations of woody matter, which would gather in every sea, near the\r\nmouths of great rivers.  On the exhaustion of the superabundance of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, the coal formation would cease, and the earth might\r\nagain become a suitable theatre of being for land animals.\r\n\r\nThe termination of the carboniferous formation is marked by symptoms of\r\nvolcanic violence, which some geologists have considered to denote the\r\nclose of one system of things and the beginning of another.  Coal beds\r\ngenerally lie in basins, as if following the curve of the bottom of seas.\r\nBut there is no such basin which is not broken up into pieces, some of\r\nwhich have been tossed up on edge, others allowed to sink, causing the\r\nends of strata to be in some instances many yards, and in a few several\r\nhundred feet, removed from the corresponding ends of neighbouring\r\nfragments.  These are held to be results of volcanic movements below, the\r\noperation of which is further seen in numerous upbursts and intrusions of\r\nvolcanic rock (trap).  That these disturbances took place about the close\r\nof the formation, and not later, is shewn in the fact of the next higher\r\ngroup of strata being comparatively undisturbed.  Other symptoms of this\r\ntime of violence are seen in the beds of conglomerate which occur amongst\r\nthe first strata above the coal.  These, as usual, consist of fragments\r\nof the elder rocks, more or less worn from being tumbled about in\r\nagitated water, and laid down in a mud paste, afterwards hardened.\r\nVolcanic disturbances break up the rocks; the pieces are worn in seas;\r\nand a deposit of conglomerate is the consequence.  Of porphyry, there are\r\nsome such pieces in the conglomerate of Devonshire, three or four tons in\r\nweight.  It is to be admitted for strict truth that, in some parts of\r\nEurope, the carboniferous formation is followed by superior deposits,\r\nwithout the appearance of such disturbances between their respective\r\nperiods; but apparently this case belongs to the class of exceptions\r\nalready noticed. {93}  That disturbance was general, is supported by the\r\nfurther and important fact of the destruction of many forms of organic\r\nbeing previously flourishing, particularly of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF THE NEW RED SANDSTONE.\r\nTERRESTRIAL ZOOLOGY COMMENCES\r\nWITH REPTILES.\r\nFIRST TRACES OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next volume of the rock series refers to an era distinguished by an\r\nevent of no less importance than the commencement of land animals.  The\r\n_New Red Sandstone System_ is subdivided into groups, some of which are\r\nwanting in some places; they are pretty fully developed in the north of\r\nEngland, in the following ascending order:—1.  Lower red sandstone; 2.\r\nMagnesian limestone; 3.  Red and white sandstones and conglomerate; 4.\r\nVariegated marls.  Between the third and fourth there is, in Germany,\r\nanother group, called the Muschelkalk, a word expressing a limestone full\r\nof shells.\r\n\r\nThe first group, containing the conglomerates already adverted to, seems\r\nto have been produced during the time of disturbance which occurred so\r\ngenerally after the carbonigenous era.  This new era is distinguished by\r\na paucity of organic remains, as might partly be expected from the\r\nappearances of disturbance, and the red tint of the rocks, the latter\r\nbeing communicated by a solution of oxide of iron, a substance\r\nunfavourable to animal life.\r\n\r\nThe second group is a limestone with an infusion of magnesia.  It is\r\ndeveloped less generally than some others, but occurs conspicuously in\r\nEngland and Germany.  Its place, above the red sandstone, shews the\r\nrecurrence of circumstances favourable to animal life, and we accordingly\r\nfind in it not only zoophytes, conchifera, and a few tribes of fish, but\r\nsome faint traces of land plants, and a new and startling appearance—a\r\nreptile of saurian (lizard) character, analogous to the now existing\r\nfamily called monitors.  Remains of this creature are found in\r\ncupriferous (copper-bearing) slate connected with the mountain limestone,\r\nat Mansfield and Glucksbrunn, in Germany, which may be taken as evidence\r\nthat dry land existed in that age near those places.  The magnesia\r\nlimestone is also remarkable as the last rock in which appears the\r\nleptæna, or producta, a conchifer of numerous species which makes a\r\nconspicuous appearance in all previous seas.  It is likewise to be\r\nobserved, that the fishes of this age, to the genera of which the names\r\npalæoniscus, catopterus, platysomus, &c., have been applied, vanish, and\r\nhenceforth appear no more.\r\n\r\nThe third group, chiefly sandstones, variously coloured according to the\r\namount and nature of the metallic oxide infused into them, shews a\r\nrecurrence of agitation, and a consequent diminution of the amount of\r\nanimal life.  In the upper part, however, of this group, there are\r\nabundant symptoms of a revival of proper conditions for such life.  There\r\nare marl beds, the origin of which substance in decomposed shells is\r\nobvious; and in Germany, though not in England, here occurs the\r\nmuschelkalk, containing numerous organic remains, (generally different\r\nfrom those of the magnesian limestone,) and noted for the specimens of\r\nland animals, which it is the first to present in any considerable\r\nabundance to our notice.\r\n\r\nThese animals are of the vertebrate sub-kingdom, but of its lowest class\r\nnext after fishes,—namely, reptiles,—a portion of the terrestrial tribes\r\nwhose imperfect respiratory system perhaps fitted them for enduring an\r\natmosphere not yet quite suitable for birds or mammifers. {97}  The\r\nspecimens found in the muschelkalk are allied to the crocodile and lizard\r\ntribes of the present day, but in the latter instance are upon a scale of\r\nmagnitude as much superior to present forms as the lepidodendron of the\r\ncoal era was superior to the dwarf club-mosses of our time.  These\r\nsaurians also combine some peculiarities of structure of a most\r\nextraordinary character.\r\n\r\nThe animal to which the name _ichthyosaurus_ has been given, was as long\r\nas a young whale, and it was fitted for living in the water, though\r\nbreathing the atmosphere.  It had the vertebral column and general bodily\r\nform of a fish, but to that were added the head and breast-bone of a\r\nlizard, and the paddles of the whale tribes.  The beak, moreover, was\r\nthat of a porpoise, and the teeth were those of a crocodile.  It must\r\nhave been a most destructive creature to the fish of those early seas.\r\n\r\nThe _plesiosaurus_ was of similar bulk, with a turtle-like body and\r\npaddles, shewing that the sea was its element, but with a long\r\nserpent-like neck, terminating in a saurian head, calculated to reach\r\nprey at a considerable distance.  These two animals, of which many\r\nvarieties have been discovered, constituting distinct species, are\r\nsupposed to have lived in the shallow borders of the seas of this and\r\nsubsequent formations, devouring immense quantities of the finny tribes.\r\nIt was at first thought that no creatures approaching them in character\r\nnow inhabit the earth; but latterly Mr. Darwin has discovered, in the\r\nreptile-peopled Galapagos Islands, in the South Sea, a marine saurian\r\nfrom three to four feet long.\r\n\r\nThe _megalosaurus_ was an enormous lizard—a land creature, also\r\ncarnivorous.  The _pterodactyle_ was another lizard, but furnished with\r\nwings to pursue its prey in the air, and varying in size between a\r\ncormorant and a snipe.  Crocodiles abounded, and some of these were\r\nherbivorous.  Such was the iguanodon, a creature of the character of the\r\niguana of the Ganges, but reaching a hundred feet in length, or twenty\r\ntimes that of its modern representative.\r\n\r\nThere were also numerous _tortoises_, some of them reaching a great size;\r\nand Professor Owen has found in Warwickshire some remains of an animal of\r\nthe batrachian order, {99} to which, from the peculiar form of the teeth,\r\nhe has given the name of labyrinthidon.  Thus, three of Cuvier’s four\r\norders of reptilia (_sauria_, _chelonia_, and _batrachia_) are\r\nrepresented in this formation, the serpent order (_ophidia_) being alone\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe variegated marl beds which constitute the uppermost group of the\r\nformation, present two additional genera of huge saurians,—the\r\nphytosaurus and mastodonsaurus.\r\n\r\nIt is in the upper beds of the red sandstone that beds of salt first\r\noccur.  These are sometimes of such thickness, that the mine from which\r\nthe material has been excavated looks like a lofty church.  We see in the\r\npresent world no circumstances calculated to produce the formation of a\r\nbed of rock salt; yet it is not difficult to understand how such strata\r\nwere formed in an age marked by ultra-tropical heat and frequent volcanic\r\ndisturbances.  An estuary, cut off by an upthrow of trap, or a change of\r\nlevel, and left to dry up under the heat of the sun, would quickly become\r\nthe bed of a dense layer of rock salt.  A second shift of level, or some\r\nother volcanic disturbance, connecting it again with the sea, would\r\nexpose this stratum to being covered over with a layer of sand or mud,\r\ndestined in time to form the next stratum of rock above it.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this era are few and unobtrusive.  Equiseta, calamites,\r\nferns, Voltzia, and a few of the other families found so abundantly in\r\nthe preceding formation, here present themselves, but in diminished size\r\nand quantity.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the proper place to advert to certain memorials of a\r\npeculiar and unexpected character respecting these early ages in the\r\nsandstones.  So low as the bottom of the carboniferous system, slabs are\r\nfound marked over a great extent of surface with that peculiar\r\ncorrugation or wrinkling which the receding tide leaves upon a sandy\r\nbeach when the sea is but slightly agitated; and not only are these\r\nripple-marks, as they are called, found on the surfaces, but casts of\r\nthem are found on the under sides of slabs lying above.  The phenomena\r\nsuggests the time when the sand ultimately formed into these stone slabs,\r\nwas part of the beach of a sea of the carbonigenous era; when, left wavy\r\nby one tide, it was covered over with a thin layer of fresh sand by the\r\nnext, and so on, precisely as such circumstances might be expected to\r\ntake place at the present day.  Sandstone surfaces, ripple-marked, are\r\nfound throughout the subsequent formations: in those of the new red, at\r\nmore than one place in England, they further bear impressions of\r\nrain-drops which have fallen upon them—the rain, of course, of the\r\ninconceivably remote age in which the sandstones were formed.  In the\r\nGreensill sandstone, near Shrewsbury, it has even been possible to tell\r\nfrom what direction the shower came which impressed the sandy surface,\r\nthe rims of the marks being somewhat raised on one side, exactly as might\r\nbe expected from a slanting shower falling at this day upon one of our\r\nbeaches.  These facts have the same sort of interest as the season rings\r\nof the Craigleith conifers, as speaking of a parity between some of the\r\nfamiliar processes of nature in those early ages and our own.\r\n\r\nIn the new red sandstone, impressions still more important in the\r\ninferences to which they tend, have been observed,—namely, the footmarks\r\nof various animals.  In a quarry of this formation, at Corncockle Muir,\r\nin Dumfriesshire, where the slabs incline at an angle of thirty-eight\r\ndegrees, the vestiges of an animal supposed to have been a tortoise are\r\ndistinctly traced up and down the slope, as if the creature had had\r\noccasion to pass backwards and forwards in that direction only, possibly\r\nin its daily visits to the sea.  Some slabs similarly impressed, in the\r\nStourton quarries in Cheshire, are further marked with a shower of rain\r\nwhich we know must have fallen _afterwards_, for its little hollows are\r\nimpressed in the footmarks also, though more slightly than on the rest of\r\nthe surface, the comparative hardness of a trodden place having\r\napparently prevented so deep an impression being made.  At Hessberg, in\r\nSaxony, the vestiges of four distinct animals have been traced, one of\r\nthem a web-footed animal of small size, considered as a congener of the\r\ncrocodile; another, whose footsteps having a resemblance to an impression\r\nof a swelled human hand, has caused it to be named the _cheirotherium_.\r\nThe footsteps of the cheirotherium have been found also in the Stourton\r\nquarries above mentioned.  Professor Owen, who stands at the head of\r\ncomparative anatomy in the present day, has expressed his belief that\r\nthis last animal was the same batrachian of which he has found fragments\r\nin the new red sandstone of Warwickshire.  At Runcorn, near Manchester,\r\nand elsewhere, have been discovered the tracks of an animal which Mr.\r\nOwen calls the rynchosaurus, uniting with the body of a reptile the beak\r\nand feet of a bird, and which clearly had been a _link_ between these two\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nIf geologists shall ultimately give their approbation to the inferences\r\nmade from a recent discovery in America, we shall have the addition of\r\nperfect birds, though probably of a low type, to the animal forms of this\r\nera.  It is stated to be in quarries of this rock, in the valley of\r\nConnecticut, that footprints have been found, apparently produced by\r\nbirds of the order grallæ, or waders.  “The footsteps appear in regular\r\nsuccession on the continuous track of an animal, in the act of walking or\r\nrunning, with the right and left foot always in their relative places.\r\nThe distance of the intervals between each footstep on the same track is\r\noccasionally varied, but to no greater amount than may be explained by\r\nthe bird having altered its pace.  Many tracks of different individuals\r\nand different species are often found crossing each other, and crowded,\r\nlike impressions of feet upon the shores of a muddy stream, where ducks\r\nand geese resort.” {103}  Some of these prints indicate small animals,\r\nbut others denote birds of what would now be an unusually large size.\r\nOne animal, having a foot fifteen inches in length, (one-half more than\r\nthat of the ostrich,) and a stride of from four to six feet, has been\r\nappropriately entitled, _ornithichnites giganteus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF THE OOLITE.\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF MAMMALIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE chronicles of this period consist of a series of beds, mostly\r\ncalcareous, taking their general name (_Oolite System_) from a\r\nconspicuous member of them—the oolite—a limestone composed of an\r\naggregation of small round grains or spherules, and so called from its\r\nfancied resemblance to a cluster of eggs, or the roe of a fish.  This\r\ntexture of stone is novel and striking.  It is supposed to be of chemical\r\norigin, each spherule being an aggregation of particles round a central\r\nnucleus.  The oolite system is largely developed in England, France,\r\nWestphalia, and Northern Italy; it appears in Northern India and Africa,\r\nand patches of it exist in Scotland, and in the vale of the Mississippi.\r\nIt may of course be yet discovered in many other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe series, as shewn in the neighbourhood of Bath, is (beginning with the\r\nlowest) as follows:—1.  Lias, a set of strata variously composed of\r\nlimestone, clay, marl, and shale, clay being predominant; 2.  Lower\r\noolitic formation, including, besides the great oolite bed of central\r\nEngland, fullers’ earth beds, forest marble, and cornbrash; 3.  Middle\r\noolitic formation, composed of two sub-groups, the Oxford clay and coral\r\nrag, the latter being a mere layer of the works of the coral polype; 4.\r\nUpper oolitic formation, including what are called Kimmeridge clay and\r\nPortland oolite.  In Yorkshire there is an additional group above the\r\nlias, and in Sutherlandshire there is another group above that again.  In\r\nthe wealds (moorlands) of Kent and Sussex, there is, in like manner,\r\nabove the fourth of the Bath series, another additional group, to which\r\nthe name of the _Wealden_ has been given, from its situation, and which,\r\ncomposed of sandstones and clays, is subdivided into Purbeck beds,\r\nHastings sand, and Weald clay.\r\n\r\nThere are no particular appearances of disturbance between the close of\r\nthe new red sandstone and the beginning of the oolite system, as far as\r\nhas been observed in England.  Yet there is a great change in the\r\nmaterials of the rocks of the two formations, shewing that while the\r\nbottoms of the seas of the one period had been chiefly arenaceous, those\r\nof the other were chiefly clayey and limy.  And there is an equal\r\ndifference between the two periods in respect of both botany and zoology.\r\nWhile the new red sandstone shews comparatively scanty traces of organic\r\ncreation, those in the oolite are extremely abundant, particularly in the\r\ndepartment of animals, and more particularly still of sea mollusca,\r\nwhich, it has been observed, are always the more conspicuous in\r\nproportion to the predominance of calcareous rocks.  It is also\r\nremarkable that the animals of the oolitic system are entirely different\r\nin species from those of the preceding age, and that these species cease\r\nbefore the next.  In this system we likewise find that uniformity over\r\ngreat space which has been remarked of the Faunas of earlier formations.\r\n“In the equivalent deposits in the Himalaya Mountains, at Fernando Po, in\r\nthe region north of the Cape of Good Hope, and in the Run of Cutch, and\r\nother parts of Hindostan, fossils have been discovered, which, as far as\r\nEnglish naturalists who have seen them can determine, are\r\nundistinguishable from certain oolite and lias fossils of Europe.” {108a}\r\n\r\nThe dry land of this age presented cycadeæ, “a beautiful class of plants\r\nbetween the palms and conifers, having a tall, straight trunk,\r\nterminating in a magnificent crown of foliage.” {108b}  There were tree\r\nferns, but in smaller proportion than in former ages; also equisetaceæ,\r\nlilia, and conifers.  The vegetation was generally analogous to that of\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope and Australia, which seems to argue a climate (we\r\nmust remember, a universal climate) between the tropical and temperate.\r\nIt was, however, sufficiently luxuriant in some instances to produce thin\r\nseams of coal, for such are found in the oolite formation of both\r\nYorkshire and Sutherland.  The sea, as for ages before, contained algæ,\r\nof which, however, only a few species have been preserved to our day.\r\nThe lower classes of the inhabitants of the ocean were unprecedentedly\r\nabundant.  The polypiaria were in such abundance as to form whole strata\r\nof themselves.  The crinoidea and echinites were also extremely numerous.\r\nShell mollusks, in hundreds of new species, occupied the bottoms of the\r\nseas of those ages, while of the swimming shell-fish, ammonites and\r\nbelemnites, there were also many scores of varieties.  The belemnite here\r\ncalls for some particular notice.  It commences in the oolite, and\r\nterminates in the next formation.  It is an elongated, conical shell,\r\nterminating in a point, and having, at the larger end, a cavity for the\r\nresidence of the animal, with a series of air-chambers below.  The\r\nanimal, placed in the upper cavity, could raise or depress itself in the\r\nwater at pleasure by a pneumatic operation upon the entral air tube\r\npervading its shell.  Its tentacula, sent abroad over the summit of the\r\nshell, searched the sea for prey.  The creature had an ink-bag, with\r\nwhich it could muddle the water around it, to protect itself from more\r\npowerful animals, and, strange to say, this has been found so well\r\npreserved that an artist has used it in one instance as a paint,\r\nwherewith to delineate the belemnite itself.\r\n\r\nThe crustacea discovered in this formation are less numerous.  There are\r\nmany fishes, some of which (_acrodus_, _psammodus_, &c.,) are presumed\r\nfrom remains of their palatal bones, to have been of the gigantic\r\ncartilaginous class, now represented by such as the cestraceon.  It has\r\nbeen considered by Professor Owen as worthy of notice, that, the\r\ncestraceon being an inhabitant of the Australian seas, we have, in both\r\nthe botany and ichthyology of this period, an analogy to that continent.\r\nThe pycnodontes, (thick-toothed,) and lepidoides, (having thick scales,)\r\nare other families described by M. Agassiz as extensively prevalent.  In\r\nthe shallow waters of the oolitic formation, the ichthyosaurus,\r\nplesiosaurus, and other huge saurian carnivora of the preceding age,\r\nplied, in increased numbers, their destructive vocation. {110}  To them\r\nwere added new genera, the cetiosaurus, mososaurus, and some others, all\r\nof similar character and habits.\r\n\r\nLand reptiles abounded, including species of the pterodactyle of the\r\npreceding age—tortoises, trionyces, crocodilians—and the pliosaurus, a\r\ncreature which appears to have formed a link between the plesiosaurus and\r\nthe crocodile.  We know of at least six species of the flying saurian,\r\nthe pterodactyle, in this formation.\r\n\r\nNow, for the first time, we find remains of insects, an order of animals\r\nnot well calculated for fossil preservation, and which are therefore\r\namongst the rarest of the animal tribes found in rocks, though they are\r\nthe most numerous of all living families.  A single libellula\r\n(dragon-fly) was found in the Stonesfield slate, a member of the lower\r\noolitic group quarried near Oxford; and this was for several years the\r\nonly specimen known to exist so early; but now many species have been\r\nfound in a corresponding rock at Solenhofen, in Germany.  It is\r\nremarkable that the remains of insects are found most plentifully near\r\nthe remains of pterodactyles, to which undoubtedly they served as prey.\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse of the highest class of the vertebrate\r\nsub-kingdom—_mammalia_—is obtained from the Stonesfield slate, where\r\nthere has been found the jaw-bone of a quadruped evidently insectivorous,\r\nand inferred, from peculiarities in the structure of that small fragment,\r\nto have belonged to the marsupial family, (pouched animals).  It may be\r\nobserved, although no specimens of so high a class of animals as mammalia\r\nare found earlier, such may nevertheless have existed: the defect may be\r\nin our not having found them; but, other things considered, the\r\nprobability is that heretofore there were no mammifers.  It is an\r\ninteresting circumstance that the first mammifers found should have\r\nbelonged to the marsupialia, when the place of that order in the scale of\r\ncreation is considered.  In the imperfect structure of their brain,\r\ndeficient in the organs connecting the two hemispheres—and in the mode of\r\ngestation, which is only in small part uterine—this family is clearly a\r\nlink between the oviparous vertebrata (birds, reptiles, and fishes) and\r\nthe higher mammifers.  This is further established by their possessing a\r\nfaint development of two canals passing from near the anus to the\r\nexternal surface of the viscera, which are fully possessed in reptiles\r\nand fishes, for the purpose of supplying aerated water to the blood\r\ncirculating in particular vessels, but which are unneeded by mammifers.\r\nSuch rudiments of organs in certain species which do not require them in\r\nany degree, are common in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms, but are\r\nalways most conspicuous in families approaching in character to those\r\nclasses to which the full organs are proper.  This subject will be more\r\nparticularly adverted to in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe highest part of the oolitic formation presents some phenomena of an\r\nunusual and interesting character, which demand special notice.\r\nImmediately above the upper oolitic group in Buckinghamshire, in the\r\nvicinity of Weymouth, and other situations, there is a thin stratum,\r\nusually called by workmen the _dirt-bed_, which appears, from\r\nincontestable evidence, to have been a soil, formed, like soils of the\r\npresent day, in the course of time, upon a surface which had previously\r\nbeen the bottom of the sea.  The dirt-bed contains exuviæ of tropical\r\ntrees, accumulated through time, as the forest shed its honours on the\r\nspot where it grew, and became itself decayed.  Near Weymouth there is a\r\npiece of this stratum, in which stumps of trees remain rooted, mostly\r\nerect or slightly inclined, and from one to three feet high; while trunks\r\nof the same forest, also silicified, lie imbedded on the surface of the\r\nsoil in which they grew.\r\n\r\nAbove this bed lie those which have been called the Wealden, from their\r\nfull development in the Weald of Sussex; and these as incontestably argue\r\nthat the dry land forming the dirt-bed had next afterwards become the\r\narea of brackish estuaries, or lakes partially connected with the sea;\r\nfor the Wealden strata contain exuviæ of fresh-water tribes, besides\r\nthose of the great saurians and chelonia.  The area of this estuary\r\ncomprehends the whole south-east province of England.  A geologist thus\r\nconfidently narrates the subsequent events: “Much calcareous matter was\r\nfirst deposited [in this estuary], and in it were entombed myriads of\r\nshells, apparently analogous to those of the vivipara.  Then came a thick\r\nenvelope of sand, sometimes interstratified with mud; and, finally, muddy\r\nmatter prevailed.  The solid surface beneath the waters would appear to\r\nhave suffered a long continued and gradual depression, which was as\r\ngradually filled, or nearly so, with transported matter; in the end,\r\nhowever, after a depression of several hundred feet, the sea again\r\nentered upon the area, not suddenly or violently—for the Wealden rocks\r\npass gradually into the superincumbent cretaceous series—but so quietly,\r\nthat the mud containing the remains of terrestrial and fresh-water\r\ncreatures was tranquilly covered up by sands replete with marine exuviæ.”\r\n{114}  A subsequent depression of the same area, to the depth of at least\r\nthree hundred fathoms, is believed to have taken place, to admit of the\r\ndeposition of the cretaceous beds lying above.\r\n\r\nFrom the scattered way in which remains of the larger terrestrial animals\r\noccur in the Wealden, and the intermixture of pebbles of the special\r\nappearance of those worn in rivers, it is also inferred that the estuary\r\nwhich once covered the south-east part of England was the mouth of a\r\nriver of that far-descending class of which the Mississippi and Amazon\r\nare examples.  What part of the earth’s surface presented the dry land\r\nthrough which that and other similar rivers flowed, no one can tell for\r\ncertain.  It has been surmised, that the particular one here spoken of\r\nmay have flowed from a point not nearer than the site of the present\r\nNewfoundland.  Professor Philips has suggested, from the analogy of the\r\nmineral composition, that anciently elevated coal strata may have\r\ncomposed the dry land from which the sandy matters of these strata were\r\nwashed.  Such a deposit as the Wealden almost necessarily implies a\r\nlocal, not a general condition; yet it has been thought that similar\r\nstrata and remains exist in the Pays de Bray, near Beauvais.  This leads\r\nto the supposition that there may have been, in that age, a series of\r\nriver-receiving estuaries along the border of some such great ocean as\r\nthe Atlantic, of which that of modern Sussex is only an example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF THE CRETACEOUS FORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE record of this period consists of a series of strata, in which chalk\r\nbeds make a conspicuous appearance, and which is therefore called the\r\ncretaceous system or formation.  In England, a long stripe, extending\r\nfrom Yorkshire to Kent, presents the cretaceous beds upon the surface,\r\ngenerally lying conformably upon the oolite, and in many instances rising\r\ninto bold escarpments towards the west.  The celebrated cliffs of Dover\r\nare of this formation.  It extends into northern France, and thence\r\nnorth-westward into Germany, whence it is traced into Scandinavia and\r\nRussia.  The same system exists in North America, and probably in other\r\nparts of the earth not yet geologically investigated.  Being a marine\r\ndeposit, it establishes that seas existed at the time of its formation on\r\nthe tracts occupied by it, while some of its organic remains prove that,\r\nin the neighbourhood of those seas, there were tracts of dry land.\r\n\r\nThe cretaceous formation in England presents beds chiefly sandy in the\r\nlowest part, chiefly clayey in the middle, and chiefly of chalk in the\r\nupper part, the chalk beds being never absent, which some of the lower\r\nare in several places.  In the vale of the Mississippi, again, the true\r\nchalk is wholly, or all but wholly absent.  In the south of England, the\r\nlower beds are, (reckoning from the lowest upwards), 1.  _Shankland_ or\r\n_greensand_, “a triple alternation of sands and sandstones with clay;” 2.\r\nGalt, “a stiff blue or black clay, abounding in shells, which frequently\r\npossess a pearly lustre;” 3.  _Hard_ chalk; 4.  Chalk with flints; these\r\ntwo last being generally white, but in some districts red, and in others\r\nyellow.  The whole are, in England, about 1200 feet thick, shewing the\r\nconsiderable depths of the ocean in which the deposits were made.\r\n\r\nChalk is a carbonate of lime, and the manner of its production in such\r\nvast quantities was long a subject of speculation among geologists.  Some\r\nlight seemed to be thrown upon the subject a few years ago, when it was\r\nobserved, that the detritus of coral reefs in the present tropical seas\r\ngave a powder, undistinguishable, when dried, from ordinary chalk.  It\r\nthen appeared likely that the chalk beds were the detritus of the corals\r\nwhich were in the oceans of that era.  Mr. Darwin, who made some curious\r\ninquiries on this point, further suggested, that the matter might have\r\nintermediately passed through the bodies of worms and fish, such as feed\r\non the corals of the present day, and in whose stomachs he has found\r\nimpure chalk.  This, however, cannot be a full explanation of the\r\nproduction of chalk, if we admit some more recent discoveries of\r\nProfessor Ehrenberg.  That master of microscopic investigation announces,\r\nthat chalk is composed partly of “inorganic particles of irregular\r\nelliptical structure and granular slaty disposition,” and partly of\r\nshells of inconceivable minuteness, “varying from the one-twelfth to the\r\ntwo hundred and eighty-eighth part of a line”—a cubic inch of the\r\nsubstance containing above ten millions of them!  The chalk of the north\r\nof Europe contains, he says, a larger proportion of the inorganic matter;\r\nthat of the south, a larger proportion of the organic matter, being in\r\nsome instances almost entirely composed of it.  He has been able to\r\nclassify many of these creatures, some of them being allied to the\r\nnautili, nummuli, cyprides, &c.  The shells of some are calcareous, of\r\nothers siliceous.  M. Ehrenberg has likewise detected microscopic\r\nsea-plants in the chalk.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive feature of the uppermost chalk beds in England, is the\r\npresence of flint nodules.  These are generally disposed in layers\r\nparallel to each other.  It was readily presumed by geologists that these\r\nmasses were formed by a chemical aggregation of particles of silica,\r\noriginally held in solution in the mass of the chalk.  But whence the\r\nsilica in a substance so different from it?  Ehrenberg suggests that it\r\nis composed of the siliceous coverings of a portion of the microscopic\r\ncreatures, whose shells he has in other instances detected in their\r\noriginal condition.  It is remarkable that the chalk _with_ flint abounds\r\nin the north of Europe; that _without_ flints in the south; while in the\r\nnorthern chalk siliceous animalcules are wanting, and in the southern\r\npresent in great quantities.  The conclusion seems but natural, that in\r\nthe one case the siliceous exuviæ have been left in their original form;\r\nin the other dissolved chemically, and aggregated on the common principle\r\nof chemical affinity into nodules of flint, probably concentrating, in\r\nevery instance, upon a piece of decaying organic matter, as has been the\r\ncase with the nodules of ironstone in the earlier rocks, and the\r\nspherules of the oolite.\r\n\r\nWhat is more remarkable, M. Ehrenberg has ascertained that at least\r\nfifty-seven species of the microscopic animals of the chalk, being\r\ninfusoria and calcareous-shelled polythalamia, are still found living in\r\nvarious parts of the earth.  These species are the most abundant in the\r\nrock.  Singly they are the most unimportant of all animals, but in the\r\nmass, forming as they do such enormous strata over a large part of the\r\nearth’s surface, they have an importance greatly exceeding that of the\r\nlargest and noblest of the beasts of the field.  Moreover, these species\r\nhave a peculiar interest, as the only specific types of that early age\r\nwhich are reproduced in the present day.  Species of sea mollusks, of\r\nreptiles, and of mammifers, have been changed again and again, since the\r\ncretaceous era; and it is not till a long subsequent age that we find the\r\nfirst traces of any other of even the humblest species which now exist;\r\nbut here have these humble infusoria and polythalamia kept their place on\r\nearth through all its revolutions since that time,—are we to say, safe in\r\ntheir very humility, which might adapt them to a greater variety of\r\ncircumstances than most other animals, or are we required to look for\r\nsome other explanation of the phenomenon?\r\n\r\nAll the ordinary and more observable orders of the inhabitants of the\r\nsea, except the cetacea, have been found in the cretaceous\r\nformation—zoophytes, radiaria, mollusks, crustacea, (in great variety of\r\nspecies,) and fishes in smaller variety.  In Europe, remains of the\r\nmarine saurians have been found; they may be presumed to have become\r\nextinct in that part of the globe before this time, their place and\r\ndestructive office being perhaps supplied by cartilaginous fishes, of\r\nwhich the teeth are found in great quantities.  In America, however,\r\nremains of the plesiosaurus have been discovered in this part of the\r\nstratified series.  The reptiles, too, so numerous in the two preceding\r\nperiods, appear to have now much diminished in numbers.  One, entitled\r\nthe mosæsaurus, seems to have held an intermediate place between the\r\nmonitor and iguana, and to have been about twenty-five feet long, with a\r\ntail calculated to assist it powerfully in swimming.  Crocodiles and\r\nturtles existed, and amongst the fishes were some of a saurian character.\r\n\r\nFuci abounded in the seas of this era.  Confervæ are found enclosed in\r\nflints.  Of terrestrial vegetation, as of terrestrial animals, the\r\nspecimens in the European area are comparatively rare, rendering it\r\nprobable that there was no dry land near.  The remains are chiefly of\r\nferns, conifers, and cycadeæ, but in the two former cases we have only\r\ncones and leaves.  There have been discovered many pieces of wood,\r\ncontaining holes drilled by the teredo, and thus shewing that they had\r\nbeen long drifted about in the ocean before being entombed at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe series in America corresponding to this, entitled the ferruginous\r\nsand formation, presents fossils generally identical with those of\r\nEurope, not excepting the fragments of drilled wood; shewing that, in\r\nthis, as in earlier ages, there was a parity of conditions for animal\r\nlife over a vast tract of the earth’s surface.  To European reptiles, the\r\nAmerican formation adds a gigantic one, styled the saurodon, from the\r\nlizard-like character of its teeth.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that footsteps of birds are considered to have been\r\ndiscovered in America, in the new red sandstone.  Some similar isolated\r\nphenomena occur in the subsequent formations.  Mr. Mantell discovered\r\nsome bones of birds, apparently waders, in the Wealden.  The immediate\r\nconnexion of that set of birds with land, may account, of course, for\r\ntheir containing a terrestrial organic relic, which the marine beds above\r\nand below did not possess.  In the slate of Glarus, in Switzerland,\r\ncorresponding to the English galt, in the chalk formation, the remains of\r\na bird have been found.  From a chalk bed near Maidstone, have likewise\r\nbeen extracted some remains of a bird, supposed to have been of the\r\nlong-winged swimmer family, and equal in size to the albatross.  These,\r\nit must be owned, are less strong traces of the birds than we possess of\r\nthe reptiles and other tribes; but it must be remembered, that the\r\nevidence of fossils, as to the absence of any class of animals from a\r\ncertain period of the earth’s history, can never be considered as more\r\nthan negative.  Animals, of which we find no remains in a particular\r\nformation, may, nevertheless, have lived at the time, and it may have\r\nonly been from unfavourable circumstances that their remains have not\r\nbeen preserved for our inspection.  The single circumstance of their\r\nbeing little liable to be carried down into seas, might be the cause of\r\ntheir non-appearance in our quarries.  There is at the same time a limit\r\nto uncertainty on this point.  We see, from what remains have been found\r\nin the whole series, a clear progress throughout, from humble to superior\r\ntypes of being.  Hence we derive a light as to what animals may have\r\nexisted at particular times, which is in some measure independent of the\r\nspecialties of fossilology.  The birds are below the mammalia in the\r\nanimal scale; and therefore they may be supposed to have existed about\r\nthe time of the new red sandstone and oolite, although we find but slight\r\ntraces of them in those formations, and, it may be said, till a\r\nconsiderably later period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF THE TERTIARY FORMATION.—\r\nMAMMALIA ABUNDANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE chalk-beds are the highest which extend over a considerable space;\r\nbut in hollows of these beds, comparatively limited in extent, there have\r\nbeen formed series of strata—clays, limestones, marls, alternating—to\r\nwhich the name of the _Tertiary Formation_ has been applied.  London and\r\nParis alike rest on basins of this formation, and another such basin\r\nextends from near Winchester, under Southampton, and re-appears in the\r\nIsle of Wight.  There is a patch, or fragment of the formation in one of\r\nthe Hebrides.  A stripe of it extends along the east coast of North\r\nAmerica, from Massachusetts to Florida.  It is also found in Sicily and\r\nItaly, insensibly blended with formations still in progress.  Though\r\ncomparatively a local formation, it is not of the less importance as a\r\nrecord of the condition of the earth during a certain period.  As in\r\nother formations, it is marked, in the most distant localities, by\r\nidentity of organic remains.\r\n\r\nThe hollows filled by the tertiary formation must be considered as the\r\nbeds of estuaries left at the conclusion of the cretaceous period.  We\r\nhave seen that an estuary, either by the drifting up of its mouth, or a\r\nchange of level in that quarter, may be supposed to have become an inland\r\nsheet of water, and that, by another change, of the reverse kind, it may\r\nbe supposed to have become an estuary again.  Such changes the Paris\r\nbasin appears to have undergone oftener than once, for, first, we have\r\nthere a fresh-water formation of clay and limestone beds; then, a\r\nmarine-limestone formation; next, a second fresh water formation, in\r\nwhich the material of the celebrated _plaster of Paris_ (gypsum) is\r\nincluded; then, a second marine formation of sandy and limy beds; and\r\nfinally, a third series of fresh-water strata.  Such alternations occur\r\nin other examples of the tertiary formation likewise.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary beds present all but an entirely new set of animals, and as\r\nwe ascend in the series, we find more and more of these identical with\r\nspecies still existing upon earth, as if we had now reached the dawn of\r\nthe present state of the zoology of our planet.  By the study of the\r\nshells alone, Mr. Lyell has been enabled to divide the whole term into\r\nfour sub-periods, to which he has given names with reference to the\r\nproportions which they respectively present of surviving species—first,\r\nthe eocene, (from ’ηως, the dawn; χαινος, recent;) second, the miocene,\r\n(μειων, less;) third, older pliocene, (πλειων, more;) fourth, newer\r\npliocene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEOCENE SUB-PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eocene period presents, in three continental groups, 1238 species of\r\nshells, of which forty-two, or 3.5 per cent, yet flourish.  Some of these\r\nare remarkable enough; but they all sink into insignificance beside the\r\nmammalian remains which the lower eocene deposits of the Paris basin\r\npresent to us, shewing that the land had now become the theatre of an\r\nextensive creation of the highest class of animals.  Cuvier ascertained\r\nabout fifty species of these, all of them long since extinct.  A\r\nconsiderable number are _pachydermata_, {127} of a character\r\napproximating to the South American tapir: the names, palæotherium,\r\nanthracotherium, anoplotherium, lophiodon, &c., have been applied to them\r\nwith a consideration of more or less conspicuous peculiarities; but a\r\ndescription of the first may give some general idea of the whole.  It was\r\nabout the size of a horse, but more squat and clumsy, and with a heavier\r\nhead, and a lower jaw shorter than the upper; the feet, also, instead of\r\nhooves, presented three large toes, rounded, and unprovided with claws.\r\nThese animals were all herbivorous.  Amongst an immense number of others\r\nare found many new reptiles, some of them adapted for fresh water;\r\nspecies of birds allied to the sea-lark, curlew, quail, buzzard, owl, and\r\npelican; species allied to the dormouse and squirrel; also the opossum\r\nand racoon; and species allied to the genette, fox, and wolf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIOCENE SUB-PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the miocene sub-period, the shells give eighteen per cent. of existing\r\nspecies, shewing a considerable advance from the preceding era, with\r\nrespect to the inhabitants of the sea.  The advance in the land animals\r\nis less marked, but yet considerable.  The predominating forms are still\r\npachydermatous, and the tapir type continues to be conspicuous.  One\r\nanimal of this kind, called the _dinotherium_, is supposed to have been\r\nnot less than eighteen feet long; it had a mole-like form of the\r\nshoulder-blade, conferring the power of digging for food, and a couple of\r\ntusks turning down from the lower jaw, by which it could have attached\r\nitself, like the walrus, to a shore or bank, while its body floated in\r\nthe water.  Dr. Buckland considers this and some similar miocene animals,\r\nas adapted for a semi-aquatic life, in a region where lakes abounded.\r\nBesides the tapirs, we have in this era animals allied to the glutton,\r\nthe bear, the dog, the horse, the hog, and lastly, several felinæ,\r\n(creatures of which the lion is the type;) all of which are new forms, as\r\nfar as we know.  There was also an abundance of marine mammalia, seals,\r\ndolphins, lamantins, walruses, and whales, none of which had previously\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLIOCENE SUB-PERIOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shells of the older pliocene give from thirty-five to fifty; those of\r\nthe newer, from ninety to ninety-five per cent. of existing species.  The\r\npachydermata of the preceding era now disappear, and are replaced by\r\nothers belonging to still existing families—elephant, hippopotamus,\r\nrhinoceros—though now extinct as species.  Some of these are startling,\r\nfrom their enormous magnitude.  The great mastodon, whose remains are\r\nfound in abundance in America, was a species of elephant, judged, from\r\npeculiarities of its teeth, to have lived on aquatic plants, and reaching\r\nthe height of twelve feet.  The mammoth was another elephant, but\r\nsupposed to have survived till comparatively recent times, as a specimen,\r\nin all respects entire, was found in 1801, preserved in ice, in Siberia.\r\nWe are more surprised by finding such gigantic proportions in an animal\r\ncalled the megatherium, which ranks in an order now assuming much humbler\r\nforms—the edentata—to which the sloth, ant-eater, and armadillo belong.\r\nThe megatherium had a skeleton of enormous solidity, with an armour-clad\r\nbody, and five toes, terminating in huge claws, wherewith to grasp the\r\nbranches, from which, like its existing congener, the sloth, it derived\r\nits food.  The megalonyx was a similar animal, only somewhat less than\r\nthe preceding.  Finally, the pliocene gives us for the first time, oxen,\r\ndeer, camels, and other specimens of the _ruminantia_.\r\n\r\nSuch is an outline of the fauna of the tertiary era, as ascertained by\r\nthe illustrious naturalists who first devoted their attention to it.  It\r\nwill be observed that it brings us up to the felinæ, or carnivora, a\r\nconsiderably elevated point in the animal scale, but still leaving a\r\nblank for the quadrumana (monkeys) and for man, who collectively form, as\r\nwill be afterwards seen, the first group in that scale.  It sometimes\r\nhappens, however, as we have seen, that a few rare traces of a particular\r\nclass of animals are in time found in formations originally thought to be\r\ndestitute of them, displaying as it were a dawn of that department of\r\ncreation.  Such seems to be the case with at least the quadrumana.  A\r\njaw-bone and tooth of an animal of this order, and belonging to the genus\r\nmacacus, were found in the London clay, (eocene,) at Kyson, near\r\nWoodbridge, in 1839.  Another jaw-bone, containing several teeth,\r\nsupposed to have belonged to a species of monkey about three feet high,\r\nwas discovered about the same time in a stratum of marl surmounted by\r\ncompact limestone, in the department of Gers, at the foot of the\r\nPyrenees.  Associated with this last were remains of not less than thirty\r\nmammiferous quadrupeds, including three species of rhinoceros, a large\r\nanoplotherium, three species of deer, two antelopes, a true dog, a large\r\ncat, an animal like a weasel, a small hare, and a huge species of the\r\nedentata.  Both of these places are considerably to the north of any\r\nregion now inhabited by the monkey tribes.  Fossil remains of quadrumana\r\nhave been found in at least two other parts of the earth,—namely, the\r\nsub-Himalayan hills, near the Sutlej, and in Brazil, (both in the\r\ntertiary strata;) the first being a large species of semnopithecus, and\r\nthe second, a still larger animal belonging to the American group of\r\nmonkeys, but a new genus, and denominated by its discoverer, Dr. Lund,\r\nprotopithecus.  The latter would be four feet in height.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable circumstance connected with the tertiary formation remains\r\nto be noticed,—namely, the prevalence of volcanic action at that era.  In\r\nAuvergne, in Catalonia, near Venice, and in the vicinity of Rome and\r\nNaples, lavas exactly resembling the produce of existing volcanoes, are\r\nassociated and intermixed with the lacustrine as well as marine\r\ntertiaries.  The superficies of tertiaries in England is disturbed by two\r\ngreat swells, forming what are called anticlinal axes, one of which\r\ndivides the London from the Hampshire basin, while the other passes\r\nthrough the Isle of Wight, both throwing the strata down at violent\r\ninclination towards the north, as if the subterranean disturbing force\r\nhad _waved_ forward in that direction.  The Pyrenees, too, and Alps, have\r\nboth undergone elevation since the deposition of the tertiaries; and in\r\nSicily there are mountains which have risen three thousand feet since the\r\ndeposition of some of the most recent of these rocks.  The general effect\r\nof these operations was of course to extend the land surface, and to\r\nincrease the variety of its features, thus improving the natural\r\ndrainage, and generally adapting the earth for the reception of higher\r\nclasses of animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERA OF THE SUPERFICIAL FORMATIONS.\r\nCOMMENCEMENT OF PRESENT SPECIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have now completed our survey of the series of stratified rocks, and\r\ntraced in their fossils the progress of organic creation down to a time\r\nwhich seems not long antecedent to the appearance of man.  There are,\r\nnevertheless, monuments of still another era or space of time which it is\r\nall but certain did also precede that event.\r\n\r\nOver the rock formations of all eras, in various parts of the globe, but\r\nconfined in general to situations not very elevated, there is a layer of\r\nstiff clay, mostly of a blue colour, mingled with fragments of rock of\r\nall sizes, travel-worn, and otherwise, and to which geologists give the\r\nname of diluvium, as being apparently the produce of some vast flood, or\r\nof the sea thrown into an unusual agitation.  It seems to indicate that,\r\nat the time when it was laid down, much of the present dry land was under\r\nthe ocean, a supposition which we shall see supported by other evidence.\r\nThe included masses of rock have been carefully inspected in many places,\r\nand traced to particular parent beds at considerable distances.\r\nConnected with these phenomena are certain rock surfaces on the slopes of\r\nhills and elsewhere, which exhibit groovings and scratchings, such as we\r\nmight suppose would be produced by a quantity of loose blocks hurried\r\nalong over them by a flood.  Another associated phenomenon is that called\r\n_crag and tail_, which exists in many places,—namely, a rocky mountain,\r\nor lesser elevation, presenting on one side the naked rock in a more or\r\nless abrupt form, and on the other a gentle slope; the sites of Windsor,\r\nEdinburgh, and Stirling, with their respective castles, are specimens of\r\ncrag and tail.  Finally, we may advert to certain long ridges of clay and\r\ngravel which arrest the attention of travellers on the surface of Sweden\r\nand Finland, and which are also found in the United States, where,\r\nindeed, the whole of these phenomena have been observed over a large\r\nsurface, as well as in Europe.  It is very remarkable that the direction\r\nfrom which the diluvial blocks have generally come, the lines of the\r\ngrooved rock surfaces, the direction of the crag and tail eminences, and\r\nthat of the clay and gravel ridges—phenomena, be it observed, extending\r\nover the northern parts of both Europe and America—are _all from the\r\nnorth and north-west towards the south-east_.  We thus acquire the idea\r\nof a powerful current moving in a direction from north-west to\r\nsouth-east, carrying, besides mud, masses of rock which furrowed the\r\nsolid surfaces as they passed along, abrading the north-west faces of\r\nmany hills, but leaving the slopes in the opposite direction uninjured,\r\nand in some instances forming long ridges of detritus along the surface.\r\nThese are curious considerations, and it has become a question of much\r\ninterest, by what means, and under what circumstances, was such a current\r\nproduced.  One hypothetical answer has some plausibility about it.  From\r\nan investigation of the nature of glaciers, and some observations which\r\nseem to indicate that these have at one time extended to lower levels,\r\nand existed in regions (the Scottish Highlands an example) where there is\r\nnow no perennial snow, it has been surmised that there was a time,\r\nsubsequent to the tertiary era, when the circumpolar ice extended far\r\ninto the temperate zone, and formed a lofty, as well as extensive\r\naccumulation.  A change to a higher temperature, producing a sudden thaw\r\nof this mass, might set free such a quantity of water as would form a\r\nlarge flood, and the southward flow of this deluge, joined to the\r\ndirection which it would obtain from the rotatory motion of the globe,\r\nwould of course produce that compound or south-easterly direction which\r\nthe phenomena require.  All of these speculations are as yet far too\r\ndeficient in facts to be of much value; and I must freely own that, for\r\none, I attach little importance to them.  All that we can legitimately\r\ninfer from the diluvium is, that the northern parts of Europe and America\r\nwere then under the sea, and that a strong current set over them.\r\n\r\nConnected with the diluvium is the history of _ossiferous caverns_, of\r\nwhich specimens singly exist at Kirkdale in Yorkshire, Gailenreuth in\r\nFranconia, and other places.  They occur in the calcareous strata, as the\r\ngreat caverns generally do, but have in all instances been naturally\r\nclosed up till the recent period of their discovery.  The floors are\r\ncovered with what appears to be a bed of the diluvial clay, over which\r\nrests a crust of stalagmite, the result of the droppings from the roof\r\nsince the time when the clay-bed was laid down.  In the instances above\r\nspecified, and several others, there have been found, under the clay bed,\r\nassemblages of the bones of animals, of many various kinds.  At Kirkdale,\r\nfor example, the remains of twenty-four species were ascertained—namely,\r\npigeon, lark, raven, duck, and partridge; mouse, water-rat, rabbit, hare,\r\ndeer, (three species,) ox, horse, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, elephant,\r\nweazel, fox, wolf, bear, tiger, hyena.  From many of the bones of the\r\ngentler of these animals being found in a broken state, it is supposed\r\nthat the cave was a haunt of hyenas and other predaceous animals, by\r\nwhich the smaller ones were here consumed.  This must have been at a time\r\nantecedent to the submersion which produced the diluvium, since the bones\r\nare covered by a bed of that formation.  It is impossible not to see here\r\na very natural series of incidents.  First, the cave is frequented by\r\nwild beasts, who make it a kind of charnel-house.  Then, submerged in the\r\ncurrent which has been spoken of, it receives a clay flooring from the\r\nwaters containing that matter in suspension.  Finally, raised from the\r\nwater, but with no mouth to the open air, it remains unintruded on for a\r\nlong series of ages, during which the clay flooring receives a new\r\ncalcareous covering, from the droppings of the roof.  Dr. Buckland, who\r\nexamined and described the Kirkdale cave, was at first of opinion that it\r\npresented a physical evidence of the Noachian deluge; but he afterwards\r\nsaw reason to consider its phenomena as of a time far apart from that\r\nevent, which rests on evidence of an entirely different kind.\r\n\r\nOur attention is next drawn to the erratic blocks or boulders, which in\r\nmany parts of the earth are thickly strewn over the surface, particularly\r\nin the north of Europe.  Some of these blocks are many tons in weight,\r\nyet are clearly ascertained to have belonged originally to situations at\r\na great distance.  Fragments, for example, of the granite of Shap Fell\r\nare found in every direction around to the distance of fifty miles, one\r\npiece being placed high upon Criffel Mountain, on the opposite side of\r\nthe Solway estuary; so also are fragments of the Alps found far up the\r\nslopes of the Jura.  There are even blocks on the east coast of England,\r\nsupposed to have travelled from Norway.  The only rational conjecture\r\nwhich can be formed as to the transport of such masses from so great a\r\ndistance, is one which presumes them to have been carried and dropped by\r\nicebergs, while the space between their original and final sites was\r\nunder ocean.  Icebergs do even now carry off such masses from the polar\r\ncoasts, which, falling when the retaining ice melts, must take up\r\nsituations at the bottom of the sea analogous to those in which we find\r\nthe erratic blocks of the present day.\r\n\r\nAs the diluvium and erratic blocks clearly suppose one last long\r\nsubmersion of the surface, (_last_, geologically speaking,) there is\r\nanother set of appearances which as manifestly shew the steps by which\r\nthe land was made afterwards to reappear.  These consist of _terraces_,\r\nwhich have been detected near, and at some distance inland from, the\r\ncoast lines of Scandinavia, Britain, America, and other regions; being\r\nevidently ancient beaches, or platforms, on which the margin of the sea\r\nat one time rested.  They have been observed at different heights above\r\nthe present sea-level, from twenty to above twelve hundred feet; and in\r\nmany places they are seen rising above each other in succession, to the\r\nnumber of three, four, and even more.  The smooth flatness of these\r\nterraces, with generally a slight inclination towards the sea, the sandy\r\ncomposition of many of them, and, in some instances, the preservation of\r\nmarine shells in the ground, identify them perfectly with existing\r\nsea-beaches, notwithstanding the cuts and scoopings which have every here\r\nand there been effected in them by water-courses.  The irresistible\r\ninference from the phenomena is, that the highest was first the coast\r\nline; then an elevation took place, and the second highest became so, the\r\nfirst being now raised into the air and thrown inland.  Then, upon\r\nanother elevation, the sea began to form, at its new point of contact\r\nwith the land, the third highest beach, and so on down to the platform\r\nnearest to the present sea-beach.  Phenomena of this kind become\r\ncomparatively familiar to us, when we hear of evidence that the last\r\nsixty feet of the elevation of Sweden, and the last eighty-five of that\r\nof Chili, have taken place since man first dwelt in those countries; nay,\r\nthat the elevation of the former country goes on at this time at the rate\r\nof about forty-five inches in a century, and that a thousand miles of the\r\nChilian coast rose four feet in one night, under the influence of a\r\npowerful earthquake, so lately as 1822.  Subterranean forces, of the kind\r\nthen exemplified in Chili, supply a ready explanation of the whole\r\nphenomena, though some other operating causes have been suggested.  In an\r\ninquiry on this point, it becomes of consequence to learn some\r\nparticulars respecting the levels.  Taking a particular beach, it is\r\ngenerally observed that the level continues the same along a considerable\r\nnumber of miles, and nothing like breaks or hitches has as yet been\r\ndetected in any case.  A second and a third beach are also observed to be\r\nexactly parallel to the first.  These facts would seem to indicate quiet\r\nelevating movements, uniform over a large tract.  It must, however, be\r\nremarked that the raised beaches at one part of a coast rarely coincide\r\nwith those at another part forty or fifty miles off.  We might suppose\r\nthis to indicate a limit in that extent of the uniformity of the\r\nelevating cause, but it would be rash to conclude positively that such is\r\nthe case.  In the present sea, as is well known, there are different\r\nlevels at different places, owing to the operation of peculiar local\r\ncauses, as currents, evaporation, and the influx of large rivers into\r\nnarrow-mouthed estuaries.  The differences of level in the ancient\r\nbeaches might be occasioned by some such causes.  But, whatever doubt may\r\nrest on this minor point, enough has been ascertained to settle the main\r\none, that we have in these platforms indubitable monuments of the last\r\nrise of the land from the sea, and the concluding great event of the\r\ngeological history.\r\n\r\nThe idea of such a wide-spread and possibly universal submersion\r\nunavoidably suggests some considerations as to the effect which it might\r\nhave upon terrestrial animal life.  It seems likely that this would be,\r\non such an occasion, extensively, if not universally destroyed.  Nor does\r\nthe idea of its universal destruction seem the less plausible, when we\r\nremark, that none of the species of land animals heretofore discovered\r\ncan be detected at a subsequent period.  The whole seem to have been now\r\nchanged.  Some geologists appear much inclined to think that there was at\r\nthis time a new development of terrestrial animal life upon the globe,\r\nand M. Agassiz, whose opinion on such a subject must always be worthy of\r\nattention, speaks all but decidedly for such a conclusion.  It must,\r\nhowever, be owned, that proofs for it are still scanty, beyond the bare\r\nfact of a submersion which appears to have had a very wide range.  I must\r\ntherefore be content to leave this point, as far as geological evidence\r\nis concerned, for future affirmation.\r\n\r\nThere are some other superficial deposits, of less consequence on the\r\npresent occasion than the diluvium—namely, lacustrine deposits, or\r\nfilled-up lakes; alluvium, or the deposits of rivers beside their\r\nmargins; deltas, the deposits made by great ones at their efflux into the\r\nsea; peat mosses; and the vegetable soil.  The animal remains found in\r\nthese generally testify to a zoology on the verge of that which still\r\nexists, or melting into it, there being included many species which still\r\nexist.  In a lacustrine deposit at Market-Weighton, in the Vale of York,\r\nthere have been found bones of the elephant, rhinoceros, bison, wolf,\r\nhorse, felis, deer, birds, all or nearly all extinct species; associated\r\nwith thirteen species of land and fresh water shells, “exactly identical\r\nwith types now living in the vicinity.”  In similar deposits in North\r\nAmerica, are remains of the mammoth, mastodon, buffalo, and other animals\r\nof extinct and living types.  In short, these superficial deposits shew\r\nprecisely such remains as might be expected from a time at which the\r\npresent system of things (to use a vague but not unexpressive phrase)\r\nobtained, but yet so far remote in chronology as to allow of the dropping\r\nof many species, through familiar causes, in the interval.  Still,\r\nhowever, there is no authentic or satisfactory instance of human remains\r\nbeing found, except in deposits obviously of very modern date; a\r\ntolerably strong proof that the creation of our own species is a\r\ncomparatively recent event, and one posterior (generally speaking) to all\r\nthe great natural transactions chronicled by geology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\nRESPECTING\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS concludes the wondrous chapter of the earth’s history which is told\r\nby geology.  It takes up our globe at the period when its original\r\nincandescent state had nearly ceased; conducts it through what we have\r\nevery reason to believe were vast, or at least very considerable, spaces\r\nof time, in the course of which many superficial changes took place, and\r\nvegetable and animal life was gradually developed; and drops it just at\r\nthe point when man was apparently about to enter on the scene.  The\r\ncompilation of such a history, from materials of so extraordinary a\r\ncharacter, and the powerful nature of the evidence which these materials\r\nafford, are calculated to excite our admiration, and the result must be\r\nallowed to exalt the dignity of science, as a product of man’s industry\r\nand his reason.\r\n\r\nIf there is any thing more than another impressed on our minds by the\r\ncourse of the geological history, it is, that the same laws and\r\nconditions of nature now apparent to us have existed throughout the whole\r\ntime, though the operation of some of these laws may now be less\r\nconspicuous than in the early ages, from some of the conditions having\r\ncome to a settlement and a close.  That seas have flowed and ebbed, and\r\nwinds disturbed their surfaces, in the time of the secondary rocks, we\r\nhave proof on the yet preserved surfaces of the sands which constituted\r\nmargins of the seas in those days.  Even the fall of wind-slanted rain is\r\nevidenced on the same tablets.  The washing down of detached matter from\r\nelevated grounds, which we see rivers constantly engaged in at the\r\npresent time, and which is daily shallowing the seas adjacent to their\r\nmouths, only appears to have proceeded on a greater scale in earlier\r\nepochs.  The volcanic subterranean force, which we see belching forth\r\nlavas on the sides of mountains, and throwing up new elevations by land\r\nand sea, was only more powerfully operative in distant ages.  To turn to\r\norganic nature, vegetation seems to have proceeded then exactly as now.\r\nThe very alternations of the seasons has been read in unmistakable\r\ncharacters in sections of the trees of those days, precisely as it might\r\nbe read in a section of a tree cut down yesterday.  The system of prey\r\namongst animals flourished throughout the whole of the pre-human period;\r\nand the adaptation of all plants and animals to their respective spheres\r\nof existence was as perfect in those early ages as it is still.\r\n\r\nBut, as has been observed, the operation of the laws may be modified by\r\nconditions.  At one early age, if there was any dry land at all, it was\r\nperhaps enveloped in an atmosphere unfit for the existence of terrestrial\r\nanimals, and which had to go though some changes before that condition\r\nwas altered.  In the carbonigenous era, dry land seems to have consisted\r\nonly of clusters of islands, and the temperature was much above what now\r\nobtains at the same places.  Volcanic forces, and perhaps also the\r\ndisintegrating power, seem to have been on the decrease since the first,\r\nor we have at least long enjoyed an exemption from such paroxysms of the\r\nformer, as appear to have prevailed at the close of the coal formation in\r\nEngland and throughout the tertiary era.  The surface has also undergone\r\na gradual progress by which it has become always more and more\r\nvariegated, and thereby fitted for the residence of a higher class of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the progress of the development of both plants and animals\r\nupon the globe, we have seen an advance in both cases, along the line\r\nleading to the higher forms of organization.  Amongst plants, we have\r\nfirst sea-weeds, afterwards land plants; and amongst these the simpler\r\n(cellular and cryptogamic) before the more complex.  In the department of\r\nzoology, we see zoophytes, radiata, mollusca, articulata, existing for\r\nages before there were any higher forms.  The first step forward gives\r\nfishes, the humblest class of the vertebrata; and, moreover, the earliest\r\nfishes partake of the character of the next lowest sub-kingdom, the\r\narticulata.  Afterwards come land animals, of which the first are\r\nreptiles, universally allowed to be the type next in advance from fishes,\r\nand to be connected with these by the links of an insensible gradation.\r\nFrom reptiles we advance to birds, and thence to mammalia, which are\r\ncommenced by marsupialia, acknowledgedly low forms in their class.  That\r\nthere is thus a progress of some kind, the most superficial glance at the\r\ngeological history is sufficient to convince us.  Indeed the doctrine of\r\nthe gradation of animal forms has received a remarkable support from the\r\ndiscoveries of this science, as several types formerly wanting to a\r\ncompletion of the series have been found in a fossil state. {149}\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely less evident, from the geological record, that the\r\nprogress of organic life has observed some correspondence with the\r\nprogress of physical conditions on the surface.  We do not know for\r\ncertain that the sea, at the time when it supported radiated, molluscous,\r\nand articulated families, was incapable of supporting fishes; but causes\r\nfor such a limitation are far from inconceivable.  The huge saurians\r\nappear to have been precisely adapted to the low muddy coasts and sea\r\nmargins of the time when they flourished.  Marsupials appear at the time\r\nwhen the surface was generally in that flat, imperfectly variegated state\r\nin which we find Australia, the region where they now live in the\r\ngreatest abundance, and one which has no higher native mammalian type.\r\nFinally, it was not till the land and sea had come into their present\r\nrelations, and the former, in its principal continents, had acquired the\r\nirregularity of surface necessary for man, that man appeared.  We have\r\nlikewise seen reason for supposing that land animals could not have lived\r\nbefore the carbonigenous era, owing to the great charge of carbonic acid\r\ngas presumed to have been contained in the atmosphere down to that time.\r\nThe surplus of this having gone, as M. Brogniart suggests, to form the\r\nvegetation, whose ruins became coal, and the air being thus brought to\r\nits present state, land animals immediately appeared.  So also,\r\nsea-plants were at first the only specimens of vegetation, because there\r\nappears to have been no place where other plants could be produced or\r\nsupported.  Land vegetation followed, at first simple, afterwards\r\ncomplex, probably in conformity with an advance of the conditions\r\nrequired by the higher class of plants.  In short, we see everywhere\r\nthroughout the geological history, strong traces of a parallel advance of\r\nthe physical conditions and the organic forms.\r\n\r\nIn examining the fossils of the lower marine creation, with a reference\r\nto the kind of rock in connexion, with which they are found, it is\r\nobserved that some strata are attended by a much greater abundance of\r\nboth species and individuals than others.  They abound most in calcareous\r\nrocks, which is precisely what might be expected, since lime is necessary\r\nfor the formation of the shells of the mollusks and articulata, and the\r\nhard substance of the crinoidea and corals; next in the carboniferous\r\nseries; next in the tertiary; next in the new red sandstone; next in\r\nslates; and lastly, least of all, in the primary rocks. {151}  This may\r\nhave been the case without regard to the origination of new species, but\r\nmore probably it was otherwise; or why, for instance, should the\r\npolypiferous zoophyta be found almost exclusively in the limestones?\r\nThere are, indeed, abundant appearances as if, throughout all the changes\r\nof the surface, the various kinds of organic life invariably _pressed\r\nin_, immediately on the specially suitable conditions arising, so that no\r\nplace which could support any form of organic being might be left for any\r\nlength of time unoccupied.  Nor is it less remarkable how various species\r\nare withdrawn from the earth, when the proper conditions for their\r\nparticular existence are changed.  The trilobite, of which fifty species\r\nexisted during the earlier formations, was extirpated before the\r\nsecondary had commenced, and appeared no more.  The ammonite does not\r\nappear above the chalk.  The species, and even genera of all the early\r\nradiata and mollusks were exchanged for others long ago.  Not one species\r\nof any creature which flourished before the tertiary (Ehrenberg’s\r\ninfusoria excepted) now exists; and of the mammalia which arose during\r\nthat series, many forms are altogether gone, while of others we have now\r\nonly kindred species.  Thus to find not only frequent additions to the\r\npreviously existing forms, but frequent withdrawals of forms which had\r\napparently become inappropriate—a constant shifting as well as advance—is\r\na fact calculated very forcibly to arrest attention.\r\n\r\nA candid consideration of all these circumstances can scarcely fail to\r\nintroduce into our minds a somewhat different idea of organic creation\r\nfrom what has hitherto been generally entertained.  That God created\r\nanimated beings, as well as the terraqueous theatre of their being, is a\r\nfact so powerfully evidenced, and so universally received, that I at once\r\ntake it for granted.  But in the particulars of this so highly supported\r\nidea, we surely here see cause for some re-consideration.  It may now be\r\ninquired,—In what way was the creation of animated beings effected?  The\r\nordinary notion may, I think, be not unjustly described as this,—that the\r\nAlmighty author produced the progenitors of all existing species by some\r\nsort of personal or immediate exertion.  But how does this notion comport\r\nwith what we have seen of the gradual advance of species, from the\r\nhumblest to the highest?  How can we suppose an immediate exertion of\r\nthis creative power at one time to produce zoophytes, another time to add\r\na few marine mollusks, another to bring in one or two conchifers, again\r\nto produce crustaceous fishes, again perfect fishes, and so on to the\r\nend?  This would surely be to take a very mean view of the Creative\r\nPower—to, in short, anthropomorphize it, or reduce it to some such\r\ncharacter as that borne by the ordinary proceedings of mankind.  And yet\r\nthis would be unavoidable; for that the organic creation was thus\r\nprogressive through a long space of time, rests on evidence which nothing\r\ncan overturn or gainsay.  Some other idea must then be come to with\r\nregard to _the mode_ in which the Divine Author proceeded in the organic\r\ncreation.  Let us seek in the history of the earth’s formation for a new\r\nsuggestion on this point.  We have seen powerful evidence, that the\r\nconstruction of this globe and its associates, and inferentially that of\r\nall the other globes of space, was the result, not of any immediate or\r\npersonal exertion on the part of the Deity, but of natural laws which are\r\nexpressions of his will.  What is to hinder our supposing that the\r\norganic creation is also a result of natural laws, which are in like\r\nmanner an expression of his will?  More than this, the fact of the\r\ncosmical arrangements being an effect of natural laws is a powerful\r\nargument for the organic arrangements being so likewise, for how can we\r\nsuppose that the august Being who brought all these countless worlds into\r\nform by the simple establishment of a natural principle flowing from his\r\nmind, was to interfere personally and specially on every occasion when a\r\nnew shell-fish or reptile was to be ushered into existence on _one_ of\r\nthese worlds?  Surely this idea is too ridiculous to be for a moment\r\nentertained.\r\n\r\nIt will be objected that the ordinary conceptions of Christian nations on\r\nthis subject are directly derived from Scripture, or, at least, are in\r\nconformity with it.  If they were clearly and unequivocally supported by\r\nScripture, it may readily be allowed that there would be a strong\r\nobjection to the reception of any opposite hypothesis.  But the fact is,\r\nhowever startling the present announcement of it may be, that the first\r\nchapter of the Mosaic record is not only not in harmony with the ordinary\r\nideas of mankind respecting cosmical and organic creation, but is opposed\r\nto them, and only in accordance with the views here taken.  When we\r\ncarefully peruse it with awakened minds, we find that all the procedure\r\nis represented primarily and pre-eminently as flowing _from commands and\r\nexpressions of will_, _not from direct acts_.  Let there be light—let\r\nthere be a firmament—let the dry land appear—let the earth bring forth\r\ngrass, the herb, the tree—let the waters bring forth the moving creature\r\nthat hath life—let the earth bring forth the living creature after his\r\nkind—these are the terms in which the principal acts are described.  The\r\nadditional expressions,—God made the firmament—God made the beast of the\r\nearth, &c., occur subordinately, and only in a few instances; they do not\r\nnecessarily convey a different idea of the mode of creation, and indeed\r\nonly appear as alternative phrases, in the usual duplicative manner of\r\nEastern narrative.  Keeping this in view, the words used in a subsequent\r\nplace, “God _formed_ man in his own image,” cannot well be understood as\r\nimplying any more than what was implied before,—namely, that man was\r\nproduced in consequence of an expression of the Divine will to that\r\neffect.  Thus, the scriptural objection quickly vanishes, and the\r\nprevalent ideas about the organic creation appear only as a mistaken\r\ninference from the text, formed at a time when man’s ignorance prevented\r\nhim from drawing therefrom a just conclusion.  At the same time, I freely\r\nown that I do not think it right to adduce the Mosaic record, either in\r\nobjection to, or support of any natural hypothesis, and this for many\r\nreasons, but particularly for this, that there is not the least\r\nappearance of an intention in that book to give philosophically exact\r\nviews of nature.\r\n\r\nTo a reasonable mind the Divine attributes must appear, not diminished or\r\nreduced in any way, by supposing a creation by law, but infinitely\r\nexalted.  It is the narrowest of all views of the Deity, and\r\ncharacteristic of a humble class of intellects, to suppose him acting\r\nconstantly in particular ways for particular occasions.  It, for one\r\nthing, greatly detracts from his foresight, the most undeniable of all\r\nthe attributes of Omnipotence.  It lowers him towards the level of our\r\nown humble intellects.  Much more worthy of him it surely is, to suppose\r\nthat all things have been commissioned by him from the first, though\r\nneither is he absent from a particle of the current of natural affairs in\r\none sense, seeing that the whole system is continually supported by his\r\nprovidence.  Even in human affairs, if I may be allowed to adopt a\r\nfamiliar illustration, there is a constant progress from specific action\r\nfor particular occasions, to arrangements which, once established, shall\r\ncontinue to answer for a great multitude of occasions.  Such plans the\r\nenlightened readily form for themselves, and conceive as being adopted by\r\nall who have to attend to a multitude of affairs, while the ignorant\r\nsuppose every act of the greatest public functionary to be the result of\r\nsome special consideration and care on his part alone.  Are we to suppose\r\nthe Deity adopting plans which harmonize only with the modes of procedure\r\nof the less enlightened of our race?  Those who would object to the\r\nhypothesis of a creation by the intervention of law, do not perhaps\r\nconsider how powerful an argument in favour of the existence of God is\r\nlost by rejecting this doctrine.  When all is seen to be the result of\r\nlaw, the idea of an Almighty Author becomes irresistible, for the\r\ncreation of a law for an endless series of phenomena—an act of\r\nintelligence above all else that we can conceive—could have no other\r\nimaginable source, and tells, moreover, as powerfully for a sustaining as\r\nfor an originating power.  On this point a remark of Dr. Buckland seems\r\napplicable: “If the properties adopted by the elements at the moment of\r\ntheir creation adapted them beforehand to the infinity of complicated\r\nuseful purposes which they have already answered, and may have still\r\nfarther to answer, under many dispensations of the material world, such\r\nan aboriginal constitution, so far from superseding an intelligent agent,\r\nwould only exalt our conceptions of the consummate skill and power that\r\ncould comprehend such an infinity of future uses under future systems, in\r\nthe original groundwork of his creation.”\r\n\r\nA late writer, in a work embracing a vast amount of miscellaneous\r\nknowledge, but written in a dogmatic style, argues at great length for\r\nthe doctrine of more immediate exertions on the part of the Deity in the\r\nworks of his creation.  One of the most striking of his illustrations is\r\nas follows:—“The coral polypi, united by a common animal bond, construct\r\na defined form in stone; many kinds construct many forms.  An allotted\r\ninstinct may permit each polypus to construct its own cell, but there is\r\nno superintending one to direct the pattern, nor can the workers unite by\r\nconsultation for such an end.  There is no recipient for an instinct by\r\nwhich the pattern might be constructed.  It is God alone, therefore, who\r\nis the architect; and for this end, consequently, he must dispose of\r\nevery new polypus required to continue the pattern, in a new and peculiar\r\nposition, which the animal could not have discovered by itself.  Yet\r\nmore, millions of these blind workers unite their works to form an\r\nisland, which is also wrought out according to a constant general\r\npattern, and of a very peculiar nature, though the separate coral works\r\nare numerously diverse.  Still less, then, here is an instinct possible.\r\nThe Great Architect himself must execute what he planned, in each case\r\nequally.  He uses these little and senseless animals as hands; but they\r\nare hands which himself must direct.  He must direct each one everywhere,\r\nand therefore he is ever acting.” {159}  This is a most notable example\r\nof a dangerous kind of reasoning.  It is now believed that corals have a\r\ngeneral life and sensation throughout the whole mass, residing in the\r\nnervous tissue which envelops them; consequently, there is nothing more\r\nwonderful in their determinate general forms than in those of other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIt may here be remarked that there is in our doctrine that harmony in all\r\nthe associated phenomena which generally marks great truths.  First, it\r\nagrees, as we have seen, with the idea of planet-creation by natural law.\r\nSecondly, upon this supposition, all that geology tells us of the\r\nsuccession of species appears natural and intelligible.  Organic life\r\n_presses in_, as has been remarked, wherever there was room and\r\nencouragement for it, the forms being always such as suited the\r\ncircumstances, and in a certain relation to them, as, for example, where\r\nthe limestone-forming seas produced an abundance of corals, crinoidea,\r\nand shell-fish.  Admitting for a moment a re-origination of species after\r\na cataclysm, as has been surmised by some geologists, though the\r\nhypothesis is always becoming less and less tenable, it harmonizes with\r\nnothing so well as the idea of a creation by law.  The more solitary\r\ncommencements of species, which would have been the most inconceivably\r\npaltry exercise for an immediately creative power, are sufficiently\r\nworthy of one operating by laws.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed, that the thing to be accounted for is not\r\nmerely the origination of organic being upon this little planet, third of\r\na series which is but one of hundreds of thousands of series, the whole\r\nof which again form but one portion of an apparently infinite\r\nglobe-peopled space, where all seems analogous.  We have to suppose, that\r\nevery one of these numberless globes is either a theatre of organic\r\nbeing, or in the way of becoming so.  This is a conclusion which every\r\naddition to our knowledge makes only the more irresistible.  Is it\r\nconceivable, as a fitting mode of exercise for creative intelligence,\r\nthat it should be constantly moving from one sphere to another, to form\r\nand plant the various species which may be required in each situation at\r\nparticular times?  Is such an idea accordant with our general conception\r\nof the dignity, not to speak of the power, of the Great Author?  Yet such\r\nis the notion which we must form, if we adhere to the doctrine of special\r\nexercise.  Let us see, on the other hand, how the doctrine of a creation\r\nby law agrees with this expanded view of the organic world.\r\n\r\nUnprepared as most men may be for such an announcement, there can be no\r\ndoubt that we are able, in this limited sphere, to form some satisfactory\r\nconclusions as to the plants and animals of those other spheres which\r\nmove at such immense distances from us.  Suppose that the first persons\r\nof an early nation who made a ship and ventured to sea in it, observed,\r\nas they sailed along, a set of objects which they had never before\r\nseen—namely, a fleet of other ships—would they not have been justified in\r\nsupposing that those ships were occupied, like their own, by human beings\r\npossessing hands to row and steer, eyes to watch the signs of the\r\nweather, intelligence to guide them from one place to another—in short,\r\nbeings in all respects like themselves, or only shewing such differences\r\nas they knew to be producible by difference of climate and habits of\r\nlife.  Precisely in this manner we can speculate on the inhabitants of\r\nremote spheres.  We see that matter has originally been diffused in one\r\nmass, of which the spheres are portions.  Consequently, inorganic matter\r\nmust be presumed to be everywhere the same, although probably with\r\ndifferences in the proportions of ingredients in different globes, and\r\nalso some difference of conditions.  Out of a certain number of the\r\nelements of inorganic matter are composed organic bodies, both vegetable\r\nand animal; such must be the rule in Jupiter and in Sirius, as it is\r\nhere.  We, therefore, are all but certain that herbaceous and ligneous\r\nfibre, that flesh and blood, are the constituents of the organic beings\r\nof all those spheres which are as yet seats of life.  Gravitation we see\r\nto be an all-pervading principle: therefore there must be a relation\r\nbetween the spheres and their respective organic occupants, by virtue of\r\nwhich they are fixed, as far as necessary, on the surface.  Such a\r\nrelation, of course, involves details as to the density and elasticity of\r\nstructure, as well as size, of the organic tenants, in proportion to the\r\ngravity of the respective planets—peculiarities, however, which may quite\r\nwell consist with the idea of a universality of general types, to which\r\nwe are about to come.  Electricity we also see to be universal; if,\r\ntherefore, it be a principle concerned in life and in mental action, as\r\nscience strongly suggests, life and mental action must everywhere be of\r\none general character.  We come to comparatively a matter of detail, when\r\nwe advert to heat and light; yet it is important to consider that these\r\nare universal agents, and that, as they bear marked relations to organic\r\nlife and structure on earth, they may be presumed to do so in other\r\nspheres also.  The considerations as to light are particularly\r\ninteresting, for, on our globe, the structure of one important organ,\r\nalmost universally distributed in the animal kingdom, is in direct and\r\nprecise relation to it.  Where there is light there will be eyes, and\r\nthese, in other spheres, will be the same in all respects as the eyes of\r\ntellurian animals, with only such differences as may be necessary to\r\naccord with minor peculiarities of condition and of situation.  It is but\r\na small stretch of the argument to suppose that, one conspicuous organ of\r\na large portion of our animal kingdom being thus universal, a parity in\r\nall the other organs—species for species, class for class, kingdom for\r\nkingdom—is highly likely, and that thus the inhabitants of all the other\r\nglobes of space bear not only a general, but a particular resemblance to\r\nthose of our own.\r\n\r\nAssuming that organic beings are thus spread over all space, the idea of\r\ntheir having all come into existence by the operation of laws everywhere\r\napplicable, is only conformable to that principle, acknowledged to be so\r\ngenerally visible in the affairs of Providence, to have all done by the\r\nemployment of the smallest possible amount of means.  Thus, as one set of\r\nlaws produced all orbs and their motions and geognostic arrangements, so\r\none set of laws overspread them all with life.  The whole productive or\r\ncreative arrangements are therefore in perfect unity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICULAR CONSIDERATIONS\r\nRESPECTING\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE ANIMATED TRIBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE general likelihood of an organic creation by law having been shewn,\r\nwe are next to inquire if science has any facts tending to bring the\r\nassumption more nearly home to nature.  Such facts there certainly are;\r\nbut it cannot be surprising that they are comparatively few and\r\nscattered, when we consider that the inquiry is into one of nature’s\r\nprofoundest mysteries, and one which has hitherto engaged no direct\r\nattention in almost any quarter.\r\n\r\nCrystallization is confessedly a phenomenon of inorganic matter; yet the\r\nsimplest rustic observer is struck by the resemblance which the examples\r\nof it left upon a window by frost bear to vegetable forms.  In some\r\ncrystallizations the mimicry is beautiful and complete; for example, in\r\nthe well-known one called the _Arbor Dianæ_.  An amalgam of four parts of\r\nsilver and two of mercury being dissolved in nitric acid, and water equal\r\nto thirty weights of the metals being added, a small piece of soft\r\namalgam of silver suspended in the solution, quickly gathers to itself\r\nthe particles of the silver of the amalgam, which form upon it a\r\n_crystallization precisely resembling a shrub_.  The experiment may be\r\nvaried in a way which serves better to detect the influence of\r\nelectricity in such operations, as noted below. {166}  Vegetable figures\r\nare also presented in some of the most ordinary appearances of the\r\nelectric fluid.  In the marks caused by positive electricity, or which it\r\nleaves in its passage, we see the ramifications of a tree, as well as of\r\nits individual leaves; those of the negative, recal the bulbous or the\r\nspreading root, according as they are clumped or divergent.  These\r\nphenomena seem to say that the electric energies have had something to do\r\nin determining the forms of plants.  That they are intimately connected\r\nwith vegetable life is indubitable, for germination will not proceed in\r\nwater charged with negative electricity, while water charged positively\r\ngreatly favours it; and a garden sensibly increases in luxuriance, when a\r\nnumber of conducting rods are made to terminate in branches over its\r\nbeds.  With regard to the resemblance of the ramifications of the\r\nbranches and leaves of plants to the traces of the positive electricity,\r\nand that of the roots to the negative, it is a circumstance calling for\r\nespecial remark, that the atmosphere, particularly its lower strata, is\r\ngenerally charged positively, while the earth is always charged\r\nnegatively.  The correspondence here is curious.  A plant thus appears as\r\na thing formed on the basis of a natural electrical operation—the _brush_\r\nrealized.  We can thus suppose the various forms of plants as,\r\nimmediately, the result of a law in electricity variously affecting them\r\naccording to their organic character, or respective germinal\r\nconstituents.  In the poplar, the brush is unusually vertical, and little\r\ndivergent; the reverse in the beech: in the palm, a pencil has proceeded\r\nstraight up for a certain distance, radiates there, and turns outwards\r\nand downwards; and so on.  We can here see at least traces of secondary\r\nmeans by which the Almighty Deviser might establish all the vegetable\r\nforms with which the earth is overspread.\r\n\r\nVegetable and animal bodies are mainly composed of the same four simple\r\nsubstances or elements—carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen.  The first\r\ncombinations of these in animals are into what are called proximate\r\nprinciples, as albumen, fibrin, urea, alantoin, &c., out of which the\r\nstructure of the animal body is composed.  Now the chemist, by the\r\nassociation of two parts oxygen, four hydrogen, two carbon, and two\r\nnitrogen, can _make urea_.  Alantoin has also been produced artificially.\r\nTwo of the proximate principles being realizable by human care, the\r\npossibility of realizing or forming all is established.  Thus the chemist\r\nmay be said to have it in his power to realize the first step in\r\norganization. {169a}  Indeed, it is fully acknowledged by Dr. Daubeny,\r\nthat in the combinations forming the proximate principles there is no\r\nchemical peculiarity.  “It is now certain,” he says, “that the same\r\nsimple laws of composition pervade the whole creation; and that, if the\r\norganic chemist only takes the requisite precautions to avoid resolving\r\ninto their ultimate elements the proximate principles upon which he\r\noperates, the results of his analysis will shew that they are combined\r\nprecisely according to the same plan as the elements of mineral bodies\r\nare known to be.” {169b}  A particular fact is here worthy of attention.\r\n“The conversion of fecula into sugar, as one of the ordinary processes of\r\nvegetable economy, is effected by the production of a secretion termed\r\n_diastose_, which occasions both the rupture of the starch vesicles, and\r\nthe change of their contained gum into sugar.  This diastose may be\r\nseparately obtained by the chemist, and it acts as effectually in his\r\nlaboratory as in the vegetable organization.  He can also imitate its\r\neffects by other chemical agents.” {170}  The writer quoted below adds,\r\n“No reasonable ground has yet been adduced for supposing that, if we had\r\nthe power of bringing together the elements of any organic compound, in\r\ntheir requisite states and proportions, the result would be any other\r\nthan that which is found in the living body.”\r\n\r\nIt is much to know the elements out of which organic bodies are composed.\r\nIt is something more to know their first combinations, and that these are\r\nsimply chemical.  How these combinations are associated in the structure\r\nof living bodies is the next inquiry, but it is one to which as yet no\r\nsatisfactory answer can be given.  The investigation of the minutiæ of\r\norganic structure by the microscope is of such recent origin, that its\r\nresults cannot be expected to be very clear.  Some facts, however, are\r\nworthy of attention with regard to the present inquiry.  It is\r\nascertained that the basis of all vegetable and animal substances\r\nconsists of nucleated cells; that is, cells having granules within them.\r\nNutriment is converted into these before being assimilated by the system.\r\nThe tissues are formed from them.  The ovum destined to become a new\r\ncreature, is originally only a cell with a contained granule.  We see it\r\nacting this reproductive part in the simplest manner in the cryptogamic\r\nplants.  “The parent cell, arrived at maturity by the exercise of its\r\norganic functions, bursts, and liberates its contained granules.  These,\r\nat once thrown upon their own resources, and entirely dependent for their\r\nnutrition on the surrounding elements, develop themselves into new cells,\r\nwhich repeat the life of their original.  Amongst the higher tribes of\r\nthe cryptogamia, the reproductive cell does not burst, but the first\r\ncells of the new structure are developed within it, and these gradually\r\nextend, by a similar process of multiplication, into that primary\r\nleaf-like expansion which is the first formed structure in all plants.”\r\n{171}  _Here the little cell becomes directly a plant_, _the full formed\r\nliving being_.  It is also worthy of remark that, in the sponges, (an\r\nanimal form,) a gemmule detached from the body of the parent, and\r\ntrusting for sustentation only to the fluid into which it has been cast,\r\nbecomes, without further process, the new creature.  Further, it has been\r\nrecently discovered by means of the microscope, that there is, as far as\r\ncan be judged, a perfect resemblance between the ovum of the mammal\r\ntribes, during that early stage when it is passing through the oviduct,\r\nand the young of the infusory animalcules.  One of the most remarkable of\r\nthese, the _volvox globator_, has exactly the form of the germ which,\r\nafter passing through a long fœtal progress, becomes a complete mammifer,\r\nan animal of the highest class.  It has even been found that both are\r\nalike provided with those _cilia_, which, producing a revolving motion,\r\nor its appearance, is partly the cause of the name given to this\r\nanimalcule.  These resemblances are the more entitled to notice, that\r\nthey were made by various observers, distant from each other at the time.\r\n{172}  It has likewise been noted that the globules of the blood are\r\nreproduced by the expansion of contained granules; they are, in short,\r\n_distinct organisms multiplied by the same fissiparous generation_.  So\r\nthat all animated nature may be said to be based on this mode of origin;\r\n_the fundamental form of organic being is a globule_, _having a new\r\nglobule forming within itself_, by which it is in time discharged, and\r\nwhich is again followed by another and another, in endless succession.\r\nIt is of course obvious that, if these globules could be produced by any\r\nprocess from inorganic elements, we should be entitled to say that the\r\nfact of a transit from the inorganic into the organic had been witnessed\r\nin that instance; the possibility of the commencement of animated\r\ncreation by the ordinary laws of nature might be considered as\r\nestablished.  Now it was given out some years ago by a French\r\nphysiologist, that _globules could be produced in albumen by\r\nelectricity_.  If, therefore, these globules be identical with the cells\r\nwhich are now held to be reproductive, it might be said that the\r\nproduction of albumen by artificial means is the only step in the process\r\nwanting.  This has not yet been effected; but it is known to be only a\r\nchemical process, the mode of which may be any day discovered in the\r\nlaboratory, and two compounds perfectly co-ordinate, urea and alantoin,\r\nhave actually been produced.\r\n\r\nIn such an investigation as the present, it is not unworthy of notice\r\nthat the production of shell is a natural operation which can be\r\nprecisely imitated artificially.  Such an incrustation takes place on\r\nboth the outside and inside of the wheel in a bleaching establishment, in\r\nwhich cotton cloth is rinsed free of the lime employed in its\r\npurification.  From the _dressing_ employed by the weaver, the cloth\r\nobtains the animal matter, _gelatin_; this and the lime form the\r\nconstituents of the incrustation, exactly as in natural shell.  In the\r\nwheel employed at Catrine, in Ayrshire, where the phenomenon was first\r\nobserved by the eye of science, it had required ten years to produce a\r\ncoating the tenth of an inch in thickness.  This incrustation has all the\r\ncharacters of shell, displaying a highly polished surface, beautifully\r\niridescent, and, when broken, a foliated texture.  The examination of it\r\nhas even thrown some light on the character and mode of formation of\r\nnatural shell.  “The plates into which the substance is divisible have\r\nbeen formed in succession, and certain intervals of time have elapsed\r\nbetween their formation; in general, every two contiguous laminæ are\r\nseparated by a thin iridescent film, varying from the three to the fifty\r\nmillionth part of an inch in thickness, and producing all the various\r\ncolours of thin plates which correspond to intermediate thicknesses:\r\nbetween some of the laminæ no such film exists, probably in consequence\r\nof the interval of time between their formation being too short; and\r\nbetween others the film has been formed of unequal thickness.  There can\r\nbe no doubt that these iridescent films are formed when the dash-wheel is\r\nat rest during the night, and that when no film exists between two\r\nlaminæ, an interval too short for its formation, (arising, perhaps, from\r\nthe stopping of the work during the day,) has elapsed during the drying\r\nor induration of one lamina and the deposition of another.” {175}  From\r\nthis it has been deduced, by a patient investigation, that those colours\r\nof mother-of-pearl, which are incommunicable to wax, arise from\r\niridescent films deposited between the laminæ of its structure, and it is\r\nhence inferred that _the animal_, like the wheel, _rests periodically\r\nfrom its labours in forming the natural substance_.\r\n\r\nThese, it will be owned, are curious and not irrelevant facts; but it\r\nwill be asked what actual experience says respecting the origination of\r\nlife.  Are there, it will be said, any authentic instances of either\r\nplants or animals, of however humble and simple a kind, having come into\r\nexistence otherwise than in the ordinary way of generation, since the\r\ntime of which geology forms the record?  It may be answered, that the\r\nnegative of this question could not be by any means formidable to the\r\ndoctrine of law-creation, seeing that the conditions necessary for the\r\noperation of the supposed life-creating laws may not have existed within\r\nrecord to any great extent.  On the other hand, as we see the physical\r\nlaws of early times still acting with more or less force, it might not be\r\nunreasonable to expect that we should still see some remnants, or partial\r\nand occasional workings of the life-creating energy amidst a system of\r\nthings generally stable and at rest.  Are there, then, any such remnants\r\nto be traced in our own day, or during man’s existence upon earth?  If\r\nthere be, it clearly would form a strong evidence in favour of the\r\ndoctrine, as what now takes place upon a confined scale and in a\r\ncomparatively casual manner may have formerly taken place on a great\r\nscale, and as the proper and eternity-destined means of supplying a\r\nvacant globe with suitable tenants.  It will at the same time be observed\r\nthat, the earth being now supplied with both kinds of tenants in great\r\nabundance, we only could expect to find the life-originating power at\r\nwork in some very special and extraordinary circumstances, and probably\r\nonly in the inferior and obscurer departments of the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if the question were asked of ten men of approved reputation in\r\nscience, nine out of the number would answer in the negative.  This is\r\nbecause, in a great number of instances where the superficial observers\r\nof former times assumed a non-generative origin for life, (as in the\r\ncelebrated case in Virgil’s fourth Georgic,) either the direct contrary\r\nhas been ascertained, or exhaustive experiments have left no alternative\r\nfrom the conclusion that ordinary generation did take place, albeit in a\r\nmanner which escapes observation.  Finding that an erroneous assumption\r\nhas been formed in many cases, modern inquirers have not hesitated to\r\nassume that there can be no case in which generation is not concerned; an\r\nassumption not only unwarranted by, but directly opposed to, the\r\nprinciples of philosophical investigation.  Yet this is truly the point\r\nat which the question now rests in the scientific world.\r\n\r\nI have no wish here to enter largely into a subject so wide and so full\r\nof difficulties; but I may remark, that the explanations usually\r\nsuggested where life takes its rise without apparent generative means,\r\nalways appear to me to partake much of the fallacy of the _petitio\r\nprincipii_.  When, for instance, lime is laid down upon a piece of waste\r\nmoss ground, and a crop of white clover for which no seeds were sown is\r\nthe consequence, the explanation that the seeds have been dormant there\r\nfor an unknown time, and were stimulated into germination when the lime\r\nproduced the appropriate circumstances, appears extremely unsatisfactory,\r\nespecially when we know that (as in an authentic case under my notice)\r\nthe spot is many miles from where clover is cultivated, and that there is\r\nnothing for six feet below but pure peat moss, clover seeds being,\r\nmoreover, known to be too heavy to be transported, as many other seeds\r\nare, by the winds.  Mushrooms, we know, can be propagated by their seed;\r\nbut another mode of raising them, well known to the gardener, is to mix\r\ncow and horse dung together, and thus form a bed in which they are\r\nexpected to grow without any seed being planted.  It is assumed that the\r\nseeds are carried by the atmosphere, unperceived by us, and, finding here\r\nan appropriate field for germination, germinate accordingly; but this is\r\nonly assumption, and though designed to be on the side of a severe\r\nphilosophy, in reality makes a pretty large demand on credulity.  There\r\nare several persons eminent in science who profess at least to find great\r\ndifficulties in accepting the doctrine of invariable generation.  One of\r\nthese, in the work noted below, {179a} has stated several considerations\r\narising from analogical reasoning, which appear to him to throw the\r\nbalance of evidence in favour of the aboriginal production of infusoria,\r\n{179b} the vegetation called mould, and the like.  One seems to be of\r\ngreat force; namely, that the animalcules, which are supposed (altogether\r\nhypothetically) to be produced by ova, are afterwards found increasing\r\ntheir numbers, not by that mode at all, but by division of their bodies.\r\nIf it be the nature of these creatures to propagate in this splitting or\r\nfissiparous manner, how could they be communicated to a vegetable\r\ninfusion?  Another fact of very high importance is presented in the\r\nfollowing terms:—“The nature of the animalcule, or vegetable production,\r\nbears a constant relation to the state of the infusion, so that, in\r\nsimilar circumstances, the same are always produced without this being\r\ninfluenced by the atmosphere.  There seems to be a certain _progressive\r\nadvance in the productive powers of the infusion_, for at the first the\r\nanimalcules are only of the smaller kinds, or monades, and afterwards\r\n_they become gradually larger and more complicated in their structure_;\r\n_after a time_, _the production ceases_, _although the materials are by\r\nno means exhausted_.  When the quantity of water is very small, and the\r\norganic matter abundant, the production is usually of a vegetable nature;\r\nwhen there is much water, animalcules are more frequently produced.”  It\r\nhas been shewn by the opponents of this theory, that when a vegetable\r\ninfusion is debarred from the contact of the atmosphere, by being closely\r\nsealed up or covered with a layer of oil, no animalcules are produced;\r\nbut it has been said, on the other hand, that the exclusion of the air\r\nmay prevent some simple condition necessary for the aboriginal\r\ndevelopment of life—and nothing is more likely.  Perhaps the prevailing\r\ndoctrine is in nothing placed in greater difficulties than it is with\r\nregard to the entozoa, or creatures which live within the bodies of\r\nothers.  These creatures do, and apparently can, live nowhere else than\r\nin the interior of other living bodies, where they generally take up\r\ntheir abode in the viscera, but also sometimes in the chambers of the\r\neye, the interior of the brain, the serous sacs, and other places having\r\nno communication from without.  Some are viviparous, others oviparous.\r\nOf the latter it cannot reasonably be supposed that the ova ever pass\r\nthrough the medium of the air, or through the blood-vessels, for they are\r\ntoo heavy for the one transit, and too large for the other.  Of the\r\nformer, it cannot be conceived how they pass into young animals—certainly\r\nnot by communication from the parent, for it has often been found that\r\nentozoa do not appear in certain generations, and some of peculiar and\r\nnoted character have only appeared at rare intervals, and in very\r\nextraordinary circumstances.  A candid view of the less popular doctrine,\r\nas to the origin of this humble form of life, is taken by a distinguished\r\nliving naturalist.  “To explain the beginning of these worms within the\r\nhuman body, on the common doctrine that all created beings proceed from\r\ntheir likes, or a primordial egg, is so difficult, that the moderns have\r\nbeen driven to speculate, as our fathers did, on their spontaneous birth;\r\nbut they have received the hypothesis with some modification.  Thus it is\r\nnot from putrefaction or fermentation that the entozoa are born, for both\r\nof these processes are rather fatal to their existence, but from the\r\naggregation and fit apposition of matter which is already organized, or\r\nhas been thrown from organized surfaces.  Their origin in this manner is\r\nnot more wonderful or more inexplicable than that of many of the inferior\r\nanimals from sections of themselves. * * Particles of matter fitted by\r\ndigestion, and their transmission through a living body, for immediate\r\nassimilation with it, or flakes of lymph detached from surfaces already\r\norganized, seem neither to exceed nor fall below that simplicity of\r\nstructure which favours this wonderful development; and the supposition\r\nthat, like morsels of a planaria, they may also, when retained in contact\r\nwith living parts, and in other favourable circumstances, continue to\r\nlive and be gradually changed into creatures of analogous conformation,\r\nis surely not so absurd as to be brought into comparison with the\r\nMetamorphoses of Ovid. * * We think the hypothesis is also supported in\r\nsome degree by the fact, that the origin of the entozoa is favoured by\r\nall causes which tend to disturb the equality between the secerning and\r\nabsorbent systems.” {182}  Here particles of organized matter are\r\nsuggested as the germinal origin of distinct and fully organized animals,\r\nmany of which have a highly developed reproductive system.  How near such\r\nparticles must be to the inorganic form of matter may be judged from what\r\nhas been said within the last few pages.  If, then, this view of the\r\nproduction of entozoa be received, it must be held as in no small degree\r\nfavourable to the general doctrine of an organic creation by law.\r\n\r\nThere is another series of facts, akin to the above, and which deserve\r\nnot less attention.  The pig, in its domestic state, is subject to the\r\nattacks of a hydatid, from which the wild animal is free; hence the\r\ndisease called measles in pork.  The domestication of the pig is of\r\ncourse an event subsequent to the origin of man; indeed, comparatively\r\nspeaking, a recent event.  Whence, then, the first progenitor of this\r\nhydatid?  So also there is a tinea which attacks dressed wool, but never\r\ntouches it in its unwashed state.  A particular insect disdains all food\r\nbut chocolate, and the larva of the _oinopota cellaris_ lives nowhere but\r\nin wine and beer, all of these being articles manufactured by man.  There\r\nis likewise a creature called the _pimelodes cyclopum_, which is only\r\nfound in subterranean cavities connected with certain specimens of the\r\nvolcanic formation in South America, dating from a time posterior to the\r\narrangements of the earth for our species.  Whence the first pymelodes\r\ncyclopum?  Will it, to a geologist, appear irrational to suppose that,\r\njust as the pterodactyle was added in the era of the new red sandstone,\r\nwhen the earth had become suited for such a creature, so may these\r\ncreatures have been added when media suitable for their existence arose,\r\nand that such phenomena may take place any day, the only cause for their\r\ntaking place seldom being the rarity of the rise of new physical\r\nconditions on a globe which seems to have already undergone the principal\r\npart of its destined mutations?\r\n\r\nBetween such isolated facts and the greater changes which attended\r\nvarious geological eras, it is not easy to see any difference, besides\r\nsimply that of the scale on which the respective phenomena took place, as\r\nthe throwing off of one copy from an engraved plate is exactly the same\r\nprocess as that by which a thousand are thrown off.  Nothing is more easy\r\nto conceive than that to Creative Providence, the numbers of such\r\nphenomena, the time when, and the circumstances under which they take\r\nplace, are indifferent matters.  The Eternal One has arranged for\r\neverything beforehand, and trusted all to the operation of the laws of\r\nhis appointment, himself being ever present in all things.  We can even\r\nconceive that man, in his many doings upon the surface of the earth, may\r\noccasionally, without his being aware of it, or otherwise, act as an\r\ninstrument in preparing the association of conditions under which the\r\ncreative laws work; and perhaps some instances of his having acted as\r\nsuch an instrument have actually occurred in our own time.\r\n\r\nI allude, of course, to the experiments conducted a few years ago by Mr.\r\nCrosse, which seemed to result in the production of a heretofore unknown\r\nspecies of insect in considerable numbers.  Various causes have prevented\r\nthese experiments and their results from receiving candid treatment, but\r\nthey may perhaps be yet found to have opened up a new and most\r\ninteresting chapter of nature’s mysteries.  Mr. Crosse was pursuing some\r\nexperiments in crystallization, causing a powerful voltaic battery to\r\noperate upon a saturated solution of silicate of potash, when the insects\r\nunexpectedly made their appearance.  He afterwards tried nitrate of\r\ncopper, which is a deadly poison, and from that fluid also did live\r\ninsects emerge.  Discouraged by the reception of his experiments, Mr.\r\nCrosse soon discontinued them; but they were some years after pursued by\r\nMr. Weekes, of Sandwich, with precisely the same results.  This\r\ngentleman, besides trying the first of the above substances, employed\r\nferro-cyanet of potash, on account of its containing a larger proportion\r\nof carbon, the principal element of organic bodies; and from this\r\nsubstance the insects were produced _in increased numbers_.  A few weeks\r\nsufficed for this experiment, with the powerful battery of Mr. Crosse;\r\nbut the first attempts of Mr. Weekes required about eleven months, a\r\nground of presumption in itself that the electricity was chiefly\r\nconcerned in the phenomenon.  The changes undergone by the fluid operated\r\nupon, were in both cases remarkable, and nearly alike.  In Mr. Weekes’\r\napparatus, the silicate of potash became first turbid, then of a milky\r\nappearance; round the negative wire of the battery, dipped into the\r\nfluid, there gathered a quantity of _gelatinous matter_, a part of the\r\nprocess of considerable importance, considering that gelatin is one of\r\nthe _proximate principles_, or first compounds, of which animal bodies\r\nare formed.  From this matter Mr. Weekes observed one of the insects in\r\nthe very act of emerging, immediately after which, it ascended to the\r\nsurface of the fluid, and sought concealment in an obscure corner of the\r\napparatus.  The insects produced by both experimentalists seem to have\r\nbeen the same, a species of acarus, minute and semi-transparent, and\r\nfurnished with long bristles, which can only be seen by the aid of the\r\nmicroscope.  It is worthy of remark, that some of these insects, soon\r\nafter their existence had commenced, were found to be likely to extend\r\ntheir species.  They were sometimes observed to go back to the fluid to\r\nfeed, and occasionally they devoured each other. {187}\r\n\r\nThe reception of novelties in science must ever be regulated very much by\r\nthe amount of kindred or relative phenomena which the public mind already\r\npossesses and acknowledges, to which the new can be assimilated.  A\r\nnovelty, however true, if there be no received truths with which it can\r\nbe shewn in harmonious relation, has little chance of a favourable\r\nhearing.  In fact, as has been often observed, there is a measure of\r\nincredulity from our ignorance as well as from our knowledge, and if the\r\nmost distinguished philosopher three hundred years ago had ventured to\r\ndevelop any striking new fact which only could harmonize with the as yet\r\nunknown Copernican solar system, we cannot doubt that it would have been\r\nuniversally scoffed at in the scientific world, such as it then was, or\r\nat the best interpreted in a thousand wrong ways in conformity with ideas\r\nalready familiar.  The experiments above described, finding a public mind\r\nwhich had never discovered a fact or conceived an idea at all analogous,\r\nwere of course ungraciously received.  It was held to be impious, even to\r\nsurmise that animals could have been formed through any instrumentality\r\nof an apparatus devised by human skill.  The more likely account of the\r\nphenomena was said to be, that the insects were only developed from ova,\r\nresting either in the fluid, or in the wooden frame on which the\r\nexperiments took place.  On these objections the following remarks may be\r\nmade.  The supposition of impiety arises from an entire misconception of\r\nwhat is implied by an aboriginal creation of insects.  The\r\nexperimentalist could never be considered as the author of the existence\r\nof these creatures, except by the most unreasoning ignorance.  The utmost\r\nthat can be claimed for, or imputed to him is that he arranged the\r\nnatural conditions under which the true creative energy—that of the\r\nDivine Author of all things—was pleased to work in that instance.  On the\r\nhypothesis here brought forward, the _acarus Crossii_ was a type of being\r\nordained from the beginning, and destined to be realized under certain\r\nphysical conditions.  When a human hand brought these conditions into the\r\nproper arrangement, it did an act akin to hundreds of familiar ones which\r\nwe execute every day, and which are followed by natural results; but it\r\ndid nothing more.  The production of the insect, if it did take place as\r\nassumed, was as clearly an act of the Almighty himself, as if he had\r\nfashioned it with hands.  For the presumption that an act of aboriginal\r\ncreation did take place, there is this to be said, that, in Mr. Weekes’s\r\nexperiment, every care that ingenuity could devise was taken to exclude\r\nthe possibility of a development of the insects from ova.  The wood of\r\nthe frame was baked in a powerful heat; a bell-shaped glass covered the\r\napparatus, and from this the atmosphere was excluded by the constantly\r\nrising fumes from the liquid, for the emission of which there was an\r\naperture so arranged at the top of the glass, that only these fumes could\r\npass.  The water was distilled, and the substance of the silicate had\r\nbeen subjected to white heat.  Thus every source of fallacy seemed to be\r\nshut up.  In such circumstances, a candid mind, which sees nothing either\r\nimpious or unphilosophical in the idea of a new creation, will be\r\ndisposed to think that there is less difficulty in believing in such a\r\ncreation having actually taken place, than in believing that, in two\r\ninstances, separated in place and time, exactly the same insects should\r\nhave chanced to arise from concealed ova, and these a species heretofore\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPOTHESIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT\r\nOF THE\r\nVEGETABLE AND ANIMAL KINGDOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has been already intimated, as a general fact, that there is an\r\nobvious gradation amongst the families of both the vegetable and animal\r\nkingdoms, from the simple lichen and animalcule respectively up to the\r\nhighest order of dicotyledonous trees and the mammalia.  Confining our\r\nattention, in the meantime, to the animal kingdom—it does not appear that\r\nthis gradation passes along one line, on which every form of animal life\r\ncan be, as it were, strung; there may be branching or double lines at\r\nsome places; or the whole may be in a circle composed of minor circles,\r\nas has been recently suggested.  But still it is incontestable that there\r\nare general appearances of a scale beginning with the simple and\r\nadvancing to the complicated.  The animal kingdom was divided by Cuvier\r\ninto four sub-kingdoms, or divisions, and these exhibit an unequivocal\r\ngradation in the order in which they are here enumerated:—Radiata,\r\n(polypes, &c.;) mollusca, (pulpy animals;) articulata, (jointed animals;)\r\nvertebrata, (animals with internal skeleton.)  The gradation can, in like\r\nmanner, be clearly traced in the _classes_ into which the sub-kingdoms\r\nare subdivided, as, for instance, when we take those of the vertebrata in\r\nthis order—reptiles, fishes, birds, mammals.\r\n\r\nWhile the external forms of all these various animals are so different,\r\nit is very remarkable that the whole are, after all, variations of a\r\nfundamental plan, which can be traced as a basis throughout the whole,\r\nthe variations being merely modifications of that plan to suit the\r\nparticular conditions in which each particular animal has been designed\r\nto live.  Starting from the primeval germ, which, as we have seen, is the\r\nrepresentative of a particular order of full-grown animals, we find all\r\nothers to be merely advances from that type, with the extension of\r\nendowments and modification of forms which are required in each\r\nparticular case; each form, also, retaining a strong affinity to that\r\nwhich precedes it, and tending to impress its own features on that which\r\nsucceeds.  This unity of structure, as it is called, becomes the more\r\nremarkable, when we observe that the organs, while preserving a\r\nresemblance, are often put to different uses.  For example: the ribs\r\nbecome, in the serpent, organs of locomotion, and the snout is extended,\r\nin the elephant, into a prehensile instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is equally remarkable that analogous purposes are served in different\r\nanimals by organs essentially different.  Thus, the mammalia breathe by\r\nlungs; the fishes, by gills.  These are not modifications of one organ,\r\nbut distinct organs.  In mammifers, the gills exist and act at an early\r\nstage of the fœtal state, but afterwards go back and appear no more;\r\nwhile the lungs are developed.  In fishes, again, the gills only are\r\nfully developed; while the lung structure either makes no advance at all,\r\nor only appears in the rudimentary form of an air-bladder.  So, also, the\r\nbaleen of the whale and the teeth of the land mammalia are different\r\norgans.  The whale, in embryo, shews the rudiments of teeth; but these,\r\nnot being wanted, are not developed, and the baleen is brought forward\r\ninstead.  The land animals, we may also be sure, have the rudiments of\r\nbaleen in their organization.  In many instances, a particular structure\r\nis found advanced to a certain point in a particular set of animals, (for\r\ninstance, feet in the serpent tribe,) although it is not there required\r\nin any degree; but the peculiarity, being carried a little farther\r\nforward, is perhaps useful in the next set of animals in the scale.  Such\r\nare called rudimentary organs.  With this class of phenomena are to be\r\nranked the useless mammæ of the male human being, and the unrequired\r\nprocess of bone in the male opossum, which is needed in the female for\r\nsupporting her pouch.  Such curious features are most conspicuous in\r\nanimals which form links between various classes.\r\n\r\nAs formerly stated, the marsupials, standing at the bottom of the\r\nmammalia, shew their affinity to the oviparous vertebrata, by the\r\nrudiments of two canals passing from near the anus to the external\r\nsurfaces of the viscera, which are fully developed in fishes, being\r\nrequired by them for the respiration of aerated waters, but which are not\r\nneeded by the atmosphere-breathing marsupials.  We have also the peculiar\r\nform of the sternum and rib-bones of the lizards _represented_ in the\r\nmammalia in certain white cartilaginous lines traceable among their\r\nabdominal muscles.  The struphionidæ (birds of the ostrich type) form a\r\nlink between birds and mammalia, and in them we find the wings\r\nimperfectly or not at all developed, a diaphragm and urinary sac, (organs\r\nwanting in other birds,) and feathers approaching the nature of hair.\r\nAgain, the ornithorynchus belongs to a class at the bottom of the\r\nmammalia, and approximating to birds, and in it behold the bill and\r\nweb-feet of that order!\r\n\r\nFor further illustration, it is obvious that, various as may be the\r\nlengths of the upper part of the vertebral column in the mammalia, it\r\nalways consists of the same parts.  The giraffe has in its tall neck the\r\nsame number of bones with the pig, which scarcely appears to have a neck\r\nat all. {195}  Man, again, has no tail; but the notion of a\r\nmuch-ridiculed philosopher of the last century is not altogether, as it\r\nhappens, without foundation, for the bones of a caudal extremity exist in\r\nan undeveloped state in the _os coccygis_ of the human subject.  The\r\nlimbs of all the vertebrate animals are, in like manner, on one plan,\r\nhowever various they may appear.  In the hind-leg of a horse, for\r\nexample, the angle called the hock is the same part which in us forms the\r\nheel; and the horse, and all other quadrupeds, with almost the solitary\r\nexception of the bear, walk, in reality, upon what answers to the toes of\r\na human being.  In this and many other quadrupeds the fore part of the\r\nextremities is shrunk up in a hoof, as the tail of the human being is\r\nshrunk up in the bony mass at the bottom of the back.  The bat, on the\r\nother hand, has these parts largely developed.  The membrane, commonly\r\ncalled its wing, is framed chiefly upon bones answering precisely to\r\nthose of the human hand; its extinct congener, the pterodactyle, had the\r\nsame membrane extended upon the fore-finger only, which in that animal\r\nwas prolonged to an extraordinary extent.  In the paddles of the whale\r\nand other animals of its order, we see the same bones as in the more\r\nhighly developed extremities of the land mammifers; and even the serpent\r\ntribes, which present no external appearance of such extremities, possess\r\nthem in reality, but in an undeveloped or rudimental state.\r\n\r\nThe same law of development presides over the vegetable kingdom.  Amongst\r\nphanerogamous plants, a certain number of organs appear to be always\r\npresent, either in a developed or rudimentary state; and those which are\r\nrudimentary can be developed by cultivation.  The flowers which bear\r\nstamens on one stalk and pistils on another, can be caused to produce\r\nboth, or to become perfect flowers, by having a sufficiency of\r\nnourishment supplied to them.  So also, where a special function is\r\nrequired for particular circumstances, nature has provided for it, not by\r\na new organ, but by a modification of a common one, which she has\r\neffected in development.  Thus, for instance, some plants destined to\r\nlive in arid situations, require to have a store of water which they may\r\nslowly absorb.  The need is arranged for by a cup-like expansion round\r\nthe stalk, in which water remains after a shower.  Now the _pitcher_, as\r\nthis is called, is not a new organ, but simply a metamorphose of a leaf.\r\n\r\nThese facts clearly shew how all the various organic forms of our world\r\nare bound up in one—how a fundamental unity pervades and embraces them\r\nall, collecting them, from the humblest lichen up to the highest\r\nmammifer, in one system, the whole creation of which must have depended\r\nupon one law or decree of the Almighty, though it did not all come forth\r\nat one time.  After what we have seen, the idea of a separate exertion\r\nfor each must appear totally inadmissible.  The single fact of abortive\r\nor rudimentary organs condemns it; for these, on such a supposition,\r\ncould be regarded in no other light than as blemishes or blunders—the\r\nthing of all others most irreconcilable with that idea of Almighty\r\nPerfection which a general view of nature so irresistibly conveys.  On\r\nthe other hand, when the organic creation is admitted to have been\r\neffected by a general law, we see nothing in these abortive parts but\r\nharmless peculiarities of development, and interesting evidences of the\r\nmanner in which the Divine Author has been pleased to work.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to advert to the most interesting class of facts connected\r\nwith the laws of organic development.  It is only in recent times that\r\nphysiologists have observed that each animal passes, in the course of its\r\ngerminal history, through a series of changes resembling the _permanent\r\nforms_ of the various orders of animals inferior to it in the scale.\r\nThus, for instance, an insect, standing at the head of the articulated\r\nanimals, is, in the larva state, a true annelid, or worm, the annelida\r\nbeing the lowest in the same class.  The embryo of a crab resembles the\r\nperfect animal of the inferior order myriapoda, and passes through all\r\nthe forms of transition which characterize the intermediate tribes of\r\ncrustacea.  The frog, for some time after its birth, is a fish with\r\nexternal gills, and other organs fitting it for an aquatic life, all of\r\nwhich are changed as it advances to maturity, and becomes a land animal.\r\nThe mammifer only passes through still more stages, according to its\r\nhigher place in the scale.  Nor is man himself exempt from this law.  His\r\nfirst form is that which is permanent in the animalcule.  His\r\norganization gradually passes through conditions generally resembling a\r\nfish, a reptile, a bird, and the lower mammalia, before it attains its\r\nspecific maturity.  At one of the last stages of his fœtal career, he\r\nexhibits an intermaxillary bone, which is characteristic of the perfect\r\nape; this is suppressed, and he may then be said to take leave of the\r\nsimial type, and become a true human creature.  Even, as we shall see,\r\nthe varieties of his race are represented in the progressive development\r\nof an individual of the highest, before we see the adult Caucasian, the\r\nhighest point yet attained in the animal scale.\r\n\r\nTo come to particular points of the organization.  The brain of man,\r\nwhich exceeds that of all other animals in complexity of organization and\r\nfulness of development, is, at one early period, only “a simple fold of\r\nnervous matter, with difficulty distinguishable into three parts, while a\r\nlittle tail-like prolongation towards the hinder parts, and which had\r\nbeen the first to appear, is the only representation of a spinal marrow.\r\nNow, in this state it perfectly resembles the brain of an adult fish,\r\nthus assuming _in transitu_ the form that in the fish is permanent.  In a\r\nshort time, however, the structure is become more complex, the parts more\r\ndistinct, the spinal marrow better marked; it is now the brain of a\r\nreptile.  The change continues; by a singular motion, certain parts\r\n(_corpora quadragemina_) which had hitherto appeared on the upper\r\nsurface, now pass towards the lower; the former is their permanent\r\nsituation in fishes and reptiles, the latter in birds and mammalia.  This\r\nis another advance in the scale, but more remains yet to be done.  The\r\ncomplication of the organ increases; cavities termed _ventricles_ are\r\nformed, which do not exist in fishes, reptiles, or birds; curiously\r\norganized parts, such as the corpora striata, are added; it is now the\r\nbrain of the mammalia.  Its last and final change alone seems wanting,\r\nthat which shall render it the brain of MAN.” {201}  And this change in\r\ntime takes place.\r\n\r\nSo also with the heart.  This organ, in the mammalia, consists of four\r\ncavities, but in the reptiles of only three, and in fishes of two only,\r\nwhile in the articulated animals it is merely a prolonged tube.  Now in\r\nthe mammal fœtus, at a certain early stage, the organ has the form of a\r\nprolonged tube; and a human being may be said to have then the heart of\r\nan insect.  Subsequently it is shortened and widened, and becomes divided\r\nby a contraction into two parts, a ventricle and an auricle; it is now\r\nthe heart of a fish.  A subdivision of the auricle afterwards makes a\r\ntriple-chambered form, as in the heart of the reptile tribes; lastly, the\r\nventricle being also subdivided, it becomes a full mammal heart.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration here presents itself with the force of the most\r\npowerful and interesting analogy.  Some of the earliest fishes of our\r\nglobe, those of the Old Red Sandstone, present, as we have seen, certain\r\npeculiarities, as the one-sided tail and an inferior position of the\r\nmouth.  No fishes of the present day, in a mature state, are so\r\ncharacterized; but some, at a certain stage of their existence, have such\r\npeculiarities.  It occurred to a geologist to inquire if the fish which\r\nexisted before the Old Red Sandstone had any peculiarities assimilating\r\nthem to the fœtal condition of existing fish, and particularly if they\r\nwere small.  The first which occur before the time of the Old Red\r\nSandstone, are those described by Mr. Murchison, as belonging to the\r\nUpper Ludlow Rocks; _they are all rather small_.  Still older are those\r\ndetected by Mr. Philips, in the Aymestry Limestone, being the most\r\nancient of the class which have as yet been discovered; _these are so\r\nextremely minute as only to be distinguishable by the microscope_.  Here\r\nwe apparently have very clear demonstrations of a parity, or rather\r\nidentity, of laws presiding over the development of the animated tribes\r\non the face of the earth, and that of the individual in embryo.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of all these illustrations is to make us look to\r\n_development_ as the principle which has been immediately concerned in\r\nthe peopling of this globe, a process extending over a vast space of\r\ntime, but which is nevertheless connected in character with the briefer\r\nprocess by which an individual being is evoked from a simple germ.  What\r\nmystery is there here—and how shall I proceed to enunciate the conception\r\nwhich I have ventured to form of what may prove to be its proper\r\nsolution!  It is an idea by no means calculated to impress by its\r\ngreatness, or to puzzle by its profoundness.  It is an idea more marked\r\nby simplicity than perhaps any other of those which have explained the\r\ngreat secrets of nature.  But in this lies, perhaps, one of its strongest\r\nclaims to the faith of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe whole train of animated beings, from the simplest and oldest up to\r\nthe highest and most recent, are, then, to be regarded as a series of\r\n_advances of the principle of development_, which have depended upon\r\nexternal physical circumstances, to which the resulting animals are\r\nappropriate.  I contemplate the whole phenomena as having been in the\r\nfirst place arranged in the counsels of Divine Wisdom, to take place, not\r\nonly upon this sphere, but upon all the others in space, under necessary\r\nmodifications, and as being carried on, from first to last, here and\r\nelsewhere, under immediate favour of the creative will or energy. {204}\r\nThe nucleated vesicle, the fundamental form of all organization, we must\r\nregard as the meeting-point between the inorganic and the organic—the end\r\nof the mineral and beginning of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, which\r\nthence start in different directions, but in perfect parallelism and\r\nanalogy.  We have already seen that this nucleated vesicle is itself a\r\ntype of mature and independent being in the infusory animalcules, as well\r\nas the starting point of the fœtal progress of every higher individual in\r\ncreation, both animal and vegetable.  We have seen that it is a form of\r\nbeing which electric agency will produce—though not perhaps usher into\r\nfull life—in albumen, one of those compound elements of animal bodies, of\r\nwhich another (urea) has been made by artificial means.  Remembering\r\nthese things, we are drawn on to the supposition, that the first step in\r\nthe creation of life upon this planet was _a chemico-electric operation_,\r\n_by which simple germinal vesicles were produced_.  This is so much, but\r\nwhat were the next steps?  Let a common vegetable infusion help us to an\r\nanswer.  There, as we have seen, simple forms are produced at first, but\r\nafterwards they become more complicated, until at length the\r\nlife-producing powers of the infusion are exhausted.  Are we to presume\r\nthat, in this case, the simple engender the complicated?  Undoubtedly,\r\nthis would not be more wonderful as a natural process than one which we\r\nnever think of wondering at, because familiar to us—namely, that in the\r\ngestation of the mammals, the animalcule-like ovum of a few days is the\r\nparent, in a sense, of the chick-like form of a few weeks, and that in\r\nall the subsequent stages—fish, reptile, &c.—the one may, with scarcely a\r\nmetaphor, be said to be the progenitor of the other.  I suggest, then, as\r\nan hypothesis already countenanced by much that is ascertained, and\r\nlikely to be further sanctioned by much that remains to be known, that\r\nthe first step was _an advance under favour of peculiar conditions_,\r\n_from the simplest forms of being_, _to the next more complicated_, _and\r\nthis through the medium of the ordinary process of generation_.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, what we ordinarily see of nature is calculated to impress\r\na conviction that each species invariably produces its like.  But I would\r\nhere call attention to a remarkable illustration of natural law which has\r\nbeen brought forward by Mr. Babbage, in his _Ninth Bridgewater Treatise_.\r\nThe reader is requested to suppose himself seated before the calculating\r\nmachine, and observing it.  It is moved by a weight, and there is a wheel\r\nwhich revolves through a small angle round its axis, at short intervals,\r\npresenting to his eye successively, a series of numbers engraved on its\r\ndivided circumference.\r\n\r\nLet the figures thus seen be the series, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c., of natural\r\nnumbers, each of which exceeds its immediate antecedent by unity.\r\n\r\n“Now, reader,” says Mr. Babbage, “let me ask you how long you will have\r\ncounted before you are firmly convinced that the engine has been so\r\nadjusted, that it will continue, while its motion is maintained, to\r\nproduce the same series of natural numbers?  Some minds are so\r\nconstituted, that, after passing the first hundred terms, they will be\r\nsatisfied that they are acquainted with the law.  After seeing five\r\nhundred terms few will doubt, and after the fifty thousandth term the\r\npropensity to believe that the succeeding term will be fifty thousand and\r\none, will be almost irresistible.  That term _will_ be fifty thousand and\r\none; and the same regular succession will continue; the five millionth\r\nand the fifty millionth term will still appear in their expected order,\r\nand one unbroken chain of natural numbers will pass before your eyes,\r\nfrom _one_ up to _one hundred million_.\r\n\r\n“True to the vast induction which has been made, the next succeeding term\r\nwill be one hundred million and one; but the next number presented by the\r\nrim of the wheel, instead of being one hundred million and two, is one\r\nhundred million _ten thousand_ and two.  The whole series from the\r\ncommencement being thus,—\r\n\r\n                                      1\r\n                                      2\r\n                                      3\r\n                                      4\r\n                                      5\r\n                                      .\r\n                                    . .\r\n                                  . . .\r\n                             99,999,999\r\n                            100,000,000\r\nregularly as far as         100,000,001\r\n                            100,010,002  the law changes.\r\n                            100,030,003\r\n                            100,060,004\r\n                            100,100,005\r\n                            100,150,006\r\n                            100,210,007\r\n                            100,280,008\r\n                                  . . .\r\n                                  . . .\r\n                                  . . .\r\n\r\n“The law which seemed at first to govern this series failed at the\r\nhundred million and second term.  This term is larger than we expected by\r\n10,000.  The next term is larger than was anticipated by 30,000, and the\r\nexcess of each term above what we had expected forms the following\r\ntable:—\r\n\r\n     10,000\r\n     30,000\r\n     60,000\r\n    100,000\r\n    150,000\r\n      . . .\r\n      . . .\r\n\r\nbeing, in fact, the series of _triangular numbers_, {208} each multiplied\r\nby 10,000.\r\n\r\n“If we now continue to observe the numbers presented by the wheel, we\r\nshall find, that for a hundred, or even for a thousand terms, they\r\ncontinue to follow the new law relating to the triangular numbers; but\r\nafter watching them for 2761 terms, we find that this law fails in the\r\ncase of the 2762d term.\r\n\r\n“If we continue to observe, we shall discover another law then coming\r\ninto action, which also is dependent, but in a different manner, on\r\ntriangular numbers.  This will continue through about 1430 terms, when a\r\nnew law is again introduced which extends over about 950 terms, and this,\r\ntoo, like all its predecessors, fails, and gives place to other laws,\r\nwhich appear at different intervals.\r\n\r\n“Now it must be observed that _the law that each number presented by the\r\nengine is greater by unity than the preceding number_, which law the\r\nobserver had deduced from an induction of a hundred million instances,\r\n_was not the true law that regulated its action_, and that the occurrence\r\nof the number 100,010,002 at the 100,000,002nd term was _as necessary a\r\nconsequence of the original adjustment_, _and might have been as fully\r\nforeknown at the commencement_, _as was the regular succession of any one\r\nof the intermediate numbers to its immediate antecedent_.  The same\r\nremark applies to the next apparent deviation from the new law, which was\r\nfounded on an induction of 2761 terms, and also to the succeeding law,\r\nwith this limitation only—that, whilst their consecutive introduction at\r\nvarious definite intervals, is a necessary consequence of the mechanical\r\nstructure of the engine, our knowledge of analysis does not enable us to\r\npredict the periods themselves at which the more distant laws will be\r\nintroduced.”\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to apply the philosophy of this passage to the\r\nquestion under consideration.  It must be borne in mind that the\r\ngestation of a single organism is the work of but a few days, weeks, or\r\nmonths; but the gestation (so to speak) of a whole creation is a matter\r\nprobably involving enormous spaces of time.  Suppose that an ephemeron,\r\nhovering over a pool for its one April day of life, were capable of\r\nobserving the fry of the frog in the water below.  In its aged afternoon,\r\nhaving seen no change upon them for such a long time, it would be little\r\nqualified to conceive that the external branchiæ of these creatures were\r\nto decay, and be replaced by internal lungs, that feet were to be\r\ndeveloped, the tail erased, and the animal then to become a denizen of\r\nthe land.  Precisely such may be our difficulty in conceiving that any of\r\nthe species which people our earth is capable of advancing by generation\r\nto a higher type of being.  During the whole time which we call the\r\nhistorical era, the limits of species have been, to ordinary observation,\r\nrigidly adhered to.  But the historical era is, we know, only a small\r\nportion of the entire age of our globe.  We do not know what may have\r\nhappened during the ages which preceded its commencement, as we do not\r\nknow what may happen in ages yet in the distant future.  All, therefore,\r\nthat we can properly infer from the apparently invariable production of\r\nlike by like is, that such is the ordinary procedure of nature in the\r\ntime immediately passing before our eyes.  Mr. Babbage’s illustration\r\npowerfully suggests that this ordinary procedure may be subordinate to a\r\nhigher law which only _permits_ it for a time, and in proper season\r\ninterrupts and changes it.  We shall soon see some philosophical evidence\r\nfor this very conclusion.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that, in the reproduction of the higher animals, the new\r\nbeing passes through stages in which it is successively fish-like and\r\nreptile-like.  But the resemblance is not to the adult fish or the adult\r\nreptile, but to the fish and reptile at a certain point in their fœtal\r\nprogress; this holds true with regard to the vascular, nervous, and other\r\nsystems alike.  It may be illustrated by a simple diagram.  The fœtus of\r\nall the four classes may be supposed to advance in an identical condition\r\nto the point A.  [Picture: Diagram]  The fish there diverges and passes\r\nalong a line apart, and peculiar to A itself, to its mature state at F.\r\nThe reptile, bird, and mammal, go on together to C, where the reptile\r\ndiverges in like manner, and advances by itself to R.  The bird diverges\r\nat D, and goes on to B.  The mammal then goes forward in a straight line\r\nto the highest point of organization at M.  This diagram shews only the\r\nmain ramifications; but the reader must suppose minor ones, representing\r\nthe subordinate differences of orders, tribes, families, genera, &c., if\r\nhe wishes to extend his views to the whole varieties of being in the\r\nanimal kingdom.  Limiting ourselves at present to the outline afforded by\r\nthis diagram, it is apparent that the only thing required for an advance\r\nfrom one type to another in the generative process is that, for example,\r\nthe fish embryo should not diverge at A, but go on to C before it\r\ndiverges, in which case the progeny will be, not a fish, but a reptile.\r\nTo protract the _straightforward part of the gestation over a small\r\nspace_—and from species to species the space would be small indeed—is all\r\nthat is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis might be done by the force of certain external conditions operating\r\nupon the parturient system.  The nature of these conditions we can only\r\nconjecture, for their operation, which in the geological eras was so\r\npowerful, has in its main strength been long interrupted, and is now\r\nperhaps only allowed to work in some of the lowest departments of the\r\norganic world, or under extraordinary casualties in some of the higher,\r\nand to these points the attention of science has as yet been little\r\ndirected.  But though this knowledge were never to be clearly attained,\r\nit need not much affect the present argument, provided it be\r\nsatisfactorily shewn that there must be some such influence within the\r\nrange of natural things.\r\n\r\nTo this conclusion it must be greatly conducive that the law of organic\r\ndevelopment is still daily seen at work to certain effects, only somewhat\r\nshort of a transition from species to species.  Sex we have seen to be a\r\nmatter of development.  There is an instance, in a humble department of\r\nthe animal world, of arrangements being made by the animals themselves\r\nfor adjusting this law to the production of a particular sex.  Amongst\r\nbees, as amongst several other insect tribes, there is in each community\r\nbut one true female, the queen bee, the workers being false females or\r\nneuters; that is to say, sex is carried on in them to a point where it is\r\nattended by sterility.  The preparatory states of the queen bee occupy\r\nsixteen days; those of the neuters, twenty; and those of males,\r\ntwenty-four.  Now it is a fact, settled by innumerable observations and\r\nexperiments, that the bees can so modify a worker in the larva state,\r\nthat, when it emerges from the pupa, it is found to be a queen or true\r\nfemale.  For this purpose they enlarge its cell, make a pyramidal hollow\r\nto allow of its assuming a vertical instead of a horizontal position,\r\nkeep it warmer than other larvæ are kept, and feed it with a peculiar\r\nkind of food.  From these simple circumstances, leading to a shortening\r\nof the embryotic condition, results a creature different in form, and\r\nalso in dispositions, from what would have otherwise been produced.  Some\r\nof the organs possessed by the worker are here altogether wanting.  We\r\nhave a creature “destined to enjoy love, to burn with jealousy and anger,\r\nto be incited to vengeance, and to pass her time without labour,” instead\r\nof one “zealous for the good of the community, a defender of the public\r\nrights, enjoying an immunity from the stimulus of sexual appetite and the\r\npains of parturition; laborious, industrious, patient, ingenious,\r\nskilful; incessantly engaged in the nurture of the young, in collecting\r\nhoney and pollen, in elaborating wax, in constructing cells and the\r\nlike!—paying the most respectful and assiduous attention to objects\r\nwhich, had its ovaries been developed, it would have hated and pursued\r\nwith the most vindictive fury till it had destroyed them!” {215}  All\r\nthese changes may be produced by a mere modification of the embryotic\r\nprogress, which it is within the power of the adult animals to effect.\r\nBut it is important to observe that this modification is different from\r\nworking a direct change upon the embryo.  It is not the different food\r\nwhich effects a metamorphosis.  All that is done is merely to accelerate\r\nthe period of the insect’s perfection.  By the arrangements made and the\r\nfood given, the embryo becomes sooner fit for being ushered forth in its\r\nimago or perfect state.  Development may be said to be thus arrested at a\r\nparticular stage—that early one at which the female sex is complete.  In\r\nthe other circumstances, it is allowed to go on four days longer, and a\r\nstage is then reached between the two sexes, which in this species is\r\ndesigned to be the perfect condition of a large portion of the community.\r\nFour days more make it a perfect male.  It is at the same time to be\r\nobserved that there is, from the period of oviposition, a destined\r\ndistinction between the sexes of the young bees.  The queen lays the\r\nwhole of the eggs which are designed to become workers, before she begins\r\nto lay those which become males.  But probably the condition of her\r\nreproductive system governs the matter of sex, for it is remarked that\r\nwhen her impregnation is delayed beyond the twenty-eighth day of her\r\nentire existence, she lays only eggs which become males.\r\n\r\nWe have here, it will be admitted, a most remarkable illustration of the\r\nprinciple of development, although in an operation limited to the\r\nproduction of sex only.  Let it not be said that the phenomena concerned\r\nin the generation of bees may be very different from those concerned in\r\nthe reproduction of the higher animals.  There is a unity throughout\r\nnature which makes the one case an instructive reflection of the other.\r\n\r\nWe shall now see an instance of development operating within the\r\nproduction of what approaches to the character of variety of species.  It\r\nis fully established that a human family, tribe, or nation, is liable, in\r\nthe course of generations, to be either advanced from a mean form to a\r\nhigher one, or degraded from a higher to a lower, by the influence of the\r\nphysical conditions in which it lives.  The coarse features, and other\r\nstructural peculiarities of the negro race only continue while these\r\npeople live amidst the circumstances usually associated with barbarism.\r\nIn a more temperate clime, and higher social state, the face and figure\r\nbecome greatly refined.  The few African nations which possess any\r\ncivilization also exhibit forms approaching the European; and when the\r\nsame people in the United States of America have enjoyed a within-door\r\nlife for several generations, they assimilate to the whites amongst whom\r\nthey live.  On the other hand, there are authentic instances of a people\r\noriginally well-formed and good-looking, being brought, by imperfect diet\r\nand a variety of physical hardships, to a meaner form.  It is remarkable\r\nthat prominence of the jaws, a recession and diminution of the cranium,\r\nand an elongation and attenuation of the limbs, are peculiarities always\r\nproduced by these miserable conditions, for they indicate an unequivocal\r\nretrogression towards the type of the lower animals.  Thus we see nature\r\nalike willing to go back and to go forward.  Both effects are simply the\r\nresult of the operation of the law of development in the generative\r\nsystem.  Give good conditions, it advances; bad ones, it recedes.  Now,\r\nperhaps, it is only because there is no longer a possibility, in the\r\nhigher types of being, of giving sufficiently favourable conditions to\r\ncarry on species to species, that we see the operation of the law so far\r\nlimited.\r\n\r\nLet us trace this law also in the production of certain classes of\r\nmonstrosities.  A human fœtus is often left with one of the most\r\nimportant parts of its frame imperfectly developed: the heart, for\r\ninstance, goes no farther than the three-chambered form, so that it is\r\nthe heart of a reptile.  There are even instances of this organ being\r\nleft in the two-chambered or fish form.  Such defects are the result of\r\nnothing more than a failure of the power of development in the system of\r\nthe mother, occasioned by weak health or misery.  Here we have apparently\r\na realization of the converse of those conditions which carry on species\r\nto species, so far, at least, as one organ is concerned.  Seeing a\r\ncomplete specific retrogression in this one point, how easy it is to\r\nimagine an access of favourable conditions sufficient to reverse the\r\nphenomenon, and make a fish mother develop a reptile heart, or a reptile\r\nmother develop a mammal one.  It is no great boldness to surmise that a\r\nsuper-adequacy in the measure of this under-adequacy (and the one thing\r\nseems as natural an occurrence as the other) would suffice in a goose to\r\ngive its progeny the body of a rat, and produce the ornithorynchus, or\r\nmight give the progeny of an ornithorynchus the mouth and feet of a true\r\nrodent, and thus complete at two stages the passage from the aves to the\r\nmammalia.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even the transition from species to species does still take place\r\nin some of the obscurer fields of creation, or under extraordinary\r\ncasualties, though science professes to have no such facts on record.  It\r\nis here to be remarked, that such facts might often happen, and yet no\r\nrecord be taken of them, for so strong is the prepossession for the\r\ndoctrine of invariable like-production, that such circumstances, on\r\noccurring, would be almost sure to be explained away on some other\r\nsupposition, or, if presented, would be disbelieved and neglected.\r\nScience, therefore, has no such facts, for the very same reason that some\r\nsmall sects are said to have no discreditable members—namely, that they\r\ndo not receive such persons, and extrude all who begin to verge upon the\r\ncharacter.  There are, nevertheless, some facts which have chanced to be\r\nreported without any reference to this hypothesis, and which it seems\r\nextremely difficult to explain satisfactorily upon any other.  One of\r\nthese has already been mentioned—a progression in the forms of the\r\nanimalcules in a vegetable infusion from the simpler to the more\r\ncomplicated, a sort of microcosm, representing the whole history of the\r\nprogress of animal creation as displayed by geology.  Another is given in\r\nthe history of the Acarus Crossii, which may be only the ultimate stage\r\nof a series of similar transformations effected by electric agency in the\r\nsolution subjected to it.  There is, however, one direct case of a\r\ntranslation of species, which has been presented with a respectable\r\namount of authority. {221}  It appears that, whenever oats sown at the\r\nusual time are kept cropped down during summer and autumn, and allowed to\r\nremain over the winter, a thin crop of rye is the harvest presented at\r\nthe close of the ensuing summer.  This experiment has been tried\r\nrepeatedly, with but one result; invariably the _secale cereale_ is the\r\ncrop reaped where the _avena sativa_, a recognised different species, was\r\nsown.  Now it will not satisfy a strict inquirer to be told that the\r\nseeds of the rye were latent in the ground and only superseded the dead\r\nproduct of the oats; for if any such fact were in the case, why should\r\nthe usurping grain be always rye?  Perhaps those curious facts which have\r\nbeen stated with regard to forests of one kind of trees, when burnt down,\r\nbeing succeeded (without planting) by other kinds, may yet be found most\r\nexplicable, as this is, upon the hypothesis of a progression of species\r\nwhich takes place under certain favouring conditions, now apparently of\r\ncomparatively rare occurrence.  The case of the oats is the more\r\nvaluable, as bearing upon the suggestion as to a protraction of the\r\ngestation at a particular part of its course.  Here, the generative\r\nprocess is, by the simple mode of cropping down, kept up for a whole year\r\nbeyond its usual term.  The type is thus allowed to advance, and what was\r\noats becomes rye.\r\n\r\nThe idea, then, which I form of the progress of organic life upon the\r\nglobe—and the hypothesis is applicable to all similar theatres of vital\r\nbeing—is, _that the simplest and most primitive type_, _under a law to\r\nwhich that of like-production is subordinate_, _gave birth to the type\r\nnext above it_, _that this again produced the next higher_, _and so on to\r\nthe very highest_, the stages of advance being in all cases very\r\nsmall—namely, from one species only to another; so that the phenomenon\r\nhas always been of a simple and modest character.  Whether the whole of\r\nany species was at once translated forward, or only a few parents were\r\nemployed to give birth to the new type, must remain undetermined; but,\r\nsupposing that the former was the case, we must presume that the moves\r\nalong the line or lines were simultaneous, so that the place vacated by\r\none species was immediately taken by the next in succession, and so on\r\nback to the first, for the supply of which the formation of a new\r\ngerminal vesicle out of inorganic matter was alone necessary.  Thus, the\r\nproduction of new forms, as shewn in the pages of the geological record,\r\nhas never been anything more than a new stage of progress in gestation,\r\nan event as simply natural, and attended as little by any circumstances\r\nof a wonderful or startling kind, as the silent advance of an ordinary\r\nmother from one week to another of her pregnancy.  Yet, be it remembered,\r\nthe whole phenomena are, in another point of view, wonders of the highest\r\nkind, for in each of them we have to trace the effect of an Almighty Will\r\nwhich had arranged the whole in such harmony with external physical\r\ncircumstances, that both were developed in parallel steps—and probably\r\nthis development upon our planet is but a sample of what has taken place,\r\nthrough the same cause, in all the other countless theatres of being\r\nwhich are suspended in space.\r\n\r\nThis may be the proper place at which to introduce the preceding\r\nillustrations in a form calculated to bring them more forcibly before the\r\nmind of the reader.  The following table was suggested to me, in\r\nconsequence of seeing the scale of animated nature presented in Dr.\r\nFletcher’s Rudiments of Physiology.  Taking that scale as its basis, it\r\nshews the wonderful parity observed in the progress of creation, as\r\npresented to our observation in the succession of fossils, and also in\r\nthe fœtal progress of one of the principal human organs. {224}  This\r\nscale, it may be remarked, was not made up with a view to support such an\r\nhypothesis as the present, nor with any apparent regard to the history of\r\nfossils, but merely to express the appearance of advancement in the\r\norders of the Cuvierian system, assuming, as the criterion of that\r\nadvancement, “an increase in the number and extent of the manifestations\r\nof life, or of the relations which an organized being bears to the\r\nexternal world.”  Excepting in the relative situation of the annelida and\r\na few of the mammal orders, the parity is perfect; nor may even these\r\nsmall discrepancies appear when the order of fossils shall have been\r\nfurther investigated, or a more correct scale shall have been formed.\r\nMeanwhile, it is a wonderful evidence in favour of our hypothesis, that a\r\nscale formed so arbitrarily should coincide to such a nearness with our\r\npresent knowledge of the succession of animal forms upon earth, and also\r\nthat both of these series should harmonize so well with the view given by\r\nmodern physiologists of the embryotic progress of one of the organs of\r\nthe highest order of animals.\r\n\r\n             [Picture: Complex table of animal kingdom] {226}\r\n\r\nThe reader has seen physical conditions several times referred to, as to\r\nbe presumed to have in some way governed the progress of the development\r\nof the zoological circle.  This language may seem vague, and, it may be\r\nasked,—can any particular physical condition be adduced as likely to have\r\naffected development?  To this it may be answered, that air and light are\r\nprobably amongst the principal agencies of this kind which operated in\r\neducing the various forms of being.  Light is found to be essential to\r\nthe development of the individual embryo.  When tadpoles were placed in a\r\nperforated box, and that box sunk in the Seine, light being the only\r\ncondition thus abstracted, they grew to a great size in their original\r\nform, but did not pass through the usual metamorphose which brings them\r\nto their mature state as frogs.  The proteus, an animal of the frog kind,\r\ninhabiting the subterraneous waters of Carniola, and which never acquires\r\nperfect lungs so as to become a land animal, is presumed to be an example\r\nof arrested development, from the same cause.  When, in connexion with\r\nthese facts, we learn that human mothers living in dark and close cells\r\nunder ground,—that is to say, with an inadequate provision of air and\r\nlight,—are found to produce an unusual proportion of defective children,\r\n{229} we can appreciate the important effects of both these physical\r\nconditions in ordinary reproduction.  Now there is nothing to forbid the\r\nsupposition that the earth has been at different stages of its career\r\nunder different conditions, as to both air and light.  On the contrary,\r\nwe have seen reason for supposing that the proportion of carbonic acid\r\ngas (the element fatal to animal life) was larger at the time of the\r\ncarboniferous formation than it afterwards became.  We have also seen\r\nthat astronomers regard the zodiacal light as a residuum of matter\r\nenveloping the sun, and which was probably at one time denser than it is\r\nnow.  Here we have the indications of causes for a progress in the\r\npurification of the atmosphere and in the diffusion of light during the\r\nearlier ages of the earth’s history, with which the progress of organic\r\nlife may have been conformable.  An accession to the proportion of\r\noxygen, and the effulgence of the central luminary, may have been the\r\nimmediate prompting cause of all those advances from species to species\r\nwhich we have seen, upon other grounds, to be necessarily supposed as\r\nhaving taken place.  And causes of the like nature may well be supposed\r\nto operate on other spheres of being, as well as on this.  I do not\r\nindeed present these ideas as furnishing the true explanation of the\r\nprogress of organic creation; they are merely thrown out as hints towards\r\nthe formation of a just hypothesis, the completion of which is only to be\r\nlooked for when some considerable advances shall have been made in the\r\namount and character of our stock of knowledge.\r\n\r\nEarly in this century, M. Lamarck, a naturalist of the highest character,\r\nsuggested an hypothesis of organic progress which deservedly incurred\r\nmuch ridicule, although it contained a glimmer of the truth.  He\r\nsurmised, and endeavoured, with a great deal of ingenuity, to prove, that\r\none being advanced in the course of generations to another, in\r\nconsequence merely of its experience of wants calling for the exercise of\r\nits faculties in a particular direction, by which exercise new\r\ndevelopments of organs took place, ending in variations sufficient to\r\nconstitute a new species.  Thus he thought that a bird would be driven by\r\nnecessity to seek its food in the water, and that, in its efforts to\r\nswim, the outstretching of its claws would lead to the expansion of the\r\nintermediate membranes, and it would thus become web-footed.  Now it is\r\npossible that wants and the exercise of faculties have entered in some\r\nmanner into the production of the phenomena which we have been\r\nconsidering; but certainly not in the way suggested by Lamarck, whose\r\nwhole notion is obviously so inadequate to account for the rise of the\r\norganic kingdoms, that we only can place it with pity among the follies\r\nof the wise.  Had the laws of organic development been known in his time,\r\nhis theory might have been of a more imposing kind.  It is upon these\r\nthat the present hypothesis is mainly founded.  I take existing natural\r\nmeans, and shew them to have been capable of producing all the existing\r\norganisms, with the simple and easily conceivable aid of a higher\r\ngenerative law, which we perhaps still see operating upon a limited\r\nscale.  I also go beyond the French philosopher to a very important\r\npoint, the original Divine conception of all the forms of being which\r\nthese natural laws were only instruments in working out and realizing.\r\nThe actuality of such a conception I hold to be strikingly demonstrated\r\nby the discoveries of Macleay, Vigors, and Swainson, with respect to the\r\naffinities and analogies of animal (and by implication vegetable)\r\norganisms. {232}  Such a regularity in the _structure_, as we may call\r\nit, of the _classification of animals_, as is shewn in their systems, is\r\ntotally irreconcilable with the idea of form going on to form merely as\r\nneeds and wishes in the animals themselves dictated.  Had such been the\r\ncase, all would have been irregular, as things arbitrary necessarily are.\r\nBut, lo, the whole plan of being is as symmetrical as the plan of a\r\nhouse, or the laying out of an old-fashioned garden!  This must needs\r\nhave been devised and arranged for beforehand.  And what a preconception\r\nor forethought have we here!  Let us only for a moment consider how\r\nvarious are the external physical conditions in which animals\r\nlive—climate, soil, temperature, land, water, air—the peculiarities of\r\nfood, and the various ways in which it is to be sought; the peculiar\r\ncircumstances in which the business of reproduction and the care-taking\r\nof the young are to be attended to—all these required to be taken into\r\naccount, and thousands of animals were to be formed suitable in\r\norganization and mental character for the concerns they were to have with\r\nthese various conditions and circumstances—here a tooth fitted for\r\ncrushing nuts; there a claw fitted to serve as a hook for suspension;\r\nhere to repress teeth and develop a bony net-work instead; there to\r\narrange for a bronchial apparatus, to last only for a certain brief time;\r\nand all these animals were to be schemed out, each as a part of a great\r\nrange, which was on the whole to be rigidly regular: let us, I say, only\r\nconsider these things, and we shall see that the decreeing of laws to\r\nbring the whole about was an act involving such a degree of wisdom and\r\ndevice as we only can attribute, adoringly, to the one Eternal and\r\nUnchangeable.  It may be asked, how does this reflection comport with\r\nthat timid philosophy which would have us to draw back from the\r\ninvestigation of God’s works, lest the knowledge of them should make us\r\nundervalue his greatness and forget his paternal character?  Does it not\r\nrather appear that our ideas of the Deity can only be worthy of him in\r\nthe ratio in which we advance in a knowledge of his works and ways; and\r\nthat the acquisition of this knowledge is consequently an available means\r\nof our growing in a genuine reverence for him!\r\n\r\nBut the idea that any of the lower animals have been concerned in any way\r\nwith the origin of man—is not this degrading?  Degrading is a term,\r\nexpressive of a notion of the human mind, and the human mind is liable to\r\nprejudices which prevent its notions from being invariably correct.  Were\r\nwe acquainted for the first time with the circumstances attending the\r\nproduction of an individual of our race, we might equally think them\r\ndegrading, and be eager to deny them, and exclude them from the admitted\r\ntruths of nature.  Knowing this fact familiarly and beyond contradiction,\r\na healthy and natural mind finds no difficulty in regarding it\r\ncomplacently.  Creative Providence has been pleased to order that it\r\nshould be so, and it must therefore be submitted to.  Now the idea as to\r\nthe progress of organic creation, if we become satisfied of its truth,\r\nought to be received precisely in this spirit.  It has pleased Providence\r\nto arrange that one species should give birth to another, until the\r\nsecond highest gave birth to man, who is the very highest: be it so, it\r\nis our part to admire and to submit.  The very faintest notion of there\r\nbeing anything ridiculous or degrading in the theory—how absurd does it\r\nappear, when we remember that every individual amongst us actually passes\r\nthrough the characters of the insect, the fish, and reptile, (to speak\r\nnothing of others,) before he is permitted to breathe the breath of life!\r\nBut such notions are mere emanations of false pride and ignorant\r\nprejudice.  He who conceives them little reflects that they, in reality,\r\ninvolve the principle of a contempt for the works and ways of God.  For\r\nit may be asked, if He, as appears, has chosen to employ inferior\r\norganisms as a generative medium for the production of higher ones, even\r\nincluding ourselves, what right have we, his humble creatures, to find\r\nfault?  There is, also, in this prejudice, an element of unkindliness\r\ntowards the lower animals, which is utterly out of place.  These\r\ncreatures are all of them part products of the Almighty Conception, as\r\nwell as ourselves.  All of them display wondrous evidences of his wisdom\r\nand benevolence.  All of them have had assigned to them by their Great\r\nFather a part in the drama of the organic world, as well as ourselves.\r\nWhy should they be held in such contempt?  Let us regard them in a proper\r\nspirit, as parts of the grand plan, instead of contemplating them in the\r\nlight of frivolous prejudices, and we shall be altogether at a loss to\r\nsee how there should be any degradation in the idea of our race having\r\nbeen genealogically connected with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACLEAY SYSTEM OF ANIMATED NATURE.\r\nTHIS SYSTEM CONSIDERED IN CONNEXION WITH THE\r\nPROGRESS OF ORGANIC CREATION, AND AS INDICATING\r\nTHE NATURAL STATUS OF MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is now high time to advert to the system formed by the animated\r\ntribes, both with a view to the possible illustration of the preceding\r\nargument, and for the light which it throws upon that general system of\r\nnature which it is the more comprehensive object of this book to\r\nascertain.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable and animal kingdoms are arranged upon a scale, starting\r\nfrom simply organized forms, and going on to the more complex, each of\r\nthese forms being but slightly different from those next to it on both\r\nsides.  The lowest and most slightly developed forms in the two kingdoms\r\nare so closely connected, that it is impossible to say where vegetable\r\nends and animal begins.  United at what may be called their bases, they\r\nstart away in different directions, but not altogether to lose sight of\r\neach other.  On the contrary, they maintain a strict analogy throughout\r\nthe whole of their subsequent courses, sub-kingdom for sub-kingdom, class\r\nfor class; shewing a beautiful, though as yet obscure relation between\r\nthe two grand forms of being, and consequently a unity in the laws which\r\nbrought them both into existence.  So complete does this analogy appear,\r\neven in the present imperfect state of science, that I fully expect in a\r\nfew years to see the animal and vegetable kingdoms duly ranked up against\r\neach other in a system of parallels, which will admit of our assigning to\r\neach species in the former the particular shrub or tree corresponding to\r\nit in the latter, all marked by unmistakable analogies of the most\r\ninteresting kind.\r\n\r\nIt is as yet but a few years since a system of subordinate analogies not\r\nless remarkable began to be speculated upon as within the range of the\r\nanimal kingdom.  Probably it also exists in the vegetable kingdom; but to\r\nthis point no direct attention has been given; so we are left to infer\r\nthat such is the case from theoretical considerations only.  We are\r\nindebted for what we know of these beautiful analogies to three\r\nnaturalists—Macleay, Vigors, and Swainson, whose labours tempt us to\r\ndismiss in a great measure the artificial classifications hitherto used,\r\nand make an entirely new conspectus of the animal kingdom, not to speak\r\nof the corresponding reform which will be required in our systems of\r\nbotany also.\r\n\r\nThe Macleay system, as it may be called in honour of its principal\r\nauthor, announces that, whether we take the whole animal kingdom, or any\r\ndefinite division of it, we shall find that we are examining a group of\r\nbeings which is capable of being arranged along a series of close\r\naffinities, _in a circular form_,—that is to say, starting from any one\r\nportion of the group, when it is properly arranged, we can proceed from\r\none to another by minute gradations, till at length, having run through\r\nthe whole, we return to the point whence we set out.  All natural groups\r\nof animals are, therefore, in the language of Mr. Macleay, _circular_;\r\nand the possibility of throwing any supposed group into a circular\r\narrangement is held as a decisive test of its being a real or natural\r\none.  It is of course to be understood that each circle is composed of a\r\nset of inferior circles: for example, a set of _tribe_ circles composes\r\nan _order_; a set of _order_ circles, again, forms a _class_; and so on.\r\nOf each group, the component circles are _invariably five in number_:\r\nthus, in the animal kingdom, there are five sub-kingdoms,—the vertebrata,\r\nannulosa, {239a} radiata, acrita, {239b} mollusca.  Take, again, one of\r\nthese sub-kingdoms, the vertebrata, and we find it composed of five\r\nclasses,—the mammalia, reptilia, pisces, amphibia, and aves, each of the\r\nother sub-kingdoms being similarly divisible.  Take the mammalia, and it\r\nis in like manner found to be composed of five orders,—the cheirotheria,\r\n{239c} feræ, cetacea, glires, ungulata.  Even in this numerical\r\nuniformity, which goes down to the lowest ramifications of the system,\r\nthere would be something very remarkable, as arguing a definite and\r\npreconceived arrangement; but this is only the least curious part of the\r\nMacleay theory.\r\n\r\nWe shall best understand the wonderfully complex system of analogies\r\ndeveloped by that theory, if we start from the part of the kingdom in\r\nwhich they were first traced,—namely, the class aves, or birds.  This\r\ngives for its five orders,—_incessores_, (perching birds,) _raptores_,\r\n(birds of prey,) _natatores_, (swimming birds,) _grallatores_, (waders,)\r\n_rasores_, (scrapers.)  In these orders our naturalists discerned\r\ndistinct organic characters, of different degrees of perfectness, the\r\nfirst being the most perfect with regard to the general character of the\r\nclass, and therefore the best representative of that class; whence it was\r\ncalled the _typical_ order.  The second was found to be inferior, or\r\nrather to have a less perfect balance of qualities; hence it was\r\ndesignated the _sub-typical_.  In this are comprehended the chief noxious\r\nand destructive animals of the circle to which it belongs.  The other\r\nthree groups were called aberrant, as exhibiting a much wider departure\r\nfrom the typical standard, although the last of the three is observed to\r\nmake a certain recovery, and join on to the typical group, so as to\r\ncomplete the circle.  The first of the aberrant groups (natatores) is\r\nremarkable for making the water the theatre of its existence, and the\r\nbirds composing it are in general of comparatively large bulk.  The\r\nsecond (grallatores) are long-limbed and long-billed, that they may wade\r\nand pick up their subsistence in the shallows and marshes in which they\r\nchiefly live.  The third (rasores) are distinguished by strong feet, for\r\nwalking or running on the ground, and for scraping in it for their food;\r\nalso by wings designed to scarcely raise them off the earth and, farther,\r\nby a general domesticity of character and usefulness to man.\r\n\r\nNow the most remarkable circumstance is, that these organic characters,\r\nhabits, and moral properties, were found to be traceable more or less\r\ndistinctly in the corresponding portions of every other group, even of\r\nthose belonging to distant subdivisions of the animal kingdom, as, for\r\ninstance, the insects.  The incessores (typical order of aves) being\r\nreduced to its constituent circles or tribes, it was found that these\r\nstrictly represented the five orders.  In the _conirostres_ are the\r\nperfections which belong to the incessores as an order, with the\r\nconspicuous external feature of a comparatively small notch in their\r\nbills; in the _dentirostres_, the notch is strong and toothlike, (hence\r\nthe name of the tribe) assimilating them to the raptores; the\r\n_fissirostres_ come into analogy with the natatores in the slight\r\ndevelopment of their feet and their great powers of flight; the\r\n_tenuirostres_ have the small mouths and long soft bills of the\r\ngrallatores.  Finally, the _scansores_ resemble the rasores in their\r\nsuperior intelligence and docility, and in their having strong limbs and\r\na bill entire at the tip.  This parity of qualities becomes clearer when\r\nplaced in a tabular form:—\r\n\r\n  _Orders of Birds_.        _Characters_.             _Tribes of\r\n                                                     Incessores_.\r\nIncessores              Most perfect of their   Conirostres.\r\n                        circle; notch of bill\r\n                        small\r\nRaptores                Notch of bill like a    Dentirostres.\r\n                        tooth\r\nNatatores               Slightly developed      Fissirostres.\r\n                        feet; strong flight\r\nGrallatores             Small mouths; long      Tenuirostres.\r\n                        soft bills\r\nRasores                 Strong feet, short      Scansores.\r\n                        wings; docile and\r\n                        domestic\r\n\r\nSome comprehensive terms are much wanted to describe these five\r\ncharacters, so curiously repeated throughout the whole of the animal, and\r\nprobably also the vegetable kingdom.  Meanwhile, Mr. Swainson calls them\r\ntypical, sub-typical, natatorial, suctorial, {242} and rasorial.  Some of\r\nhis illustrations of the principle are exceedingly interesting.  He shews\r\nthat the leading animal of a typical circle usually has a combination of\r\nproperties concentrated in itself, without any of these preponderating\r\nremarkably over others.  The sub-typical circles, he says, “do not\r\ncomprise the largest individuals in bulk, but always those which are the\r\nmost powerfully armed, either for inflicting injury on their own class,\r\nfor exciting terror, producing injury, or creating annoyance to man.\r\nTheir dispositions are often sanguinary, since the forms most conspicuous\r\namong them live by rapine, and subsist on the blood of other animals.\r\nThey are, in short, symbolically types of _evil_.”  This symbolical\r\ncharacter is most conspicuous about the centre of the series of\r\ngradations:—\r\n\r\nKingdom               Annulosa.\r\nSub-kingdom           Reptilia.\r\nClass (Mammalia)      Feræ.\r\n(Aves)                Raptores.\r\n\r\nIn the annulosa it is not distinct, although we must also remember that\r\ninsects do produce enormous ravages and annoyance in many parts of the\r\nearth.  In the reptilia it is more distinct, since to this class belong\r\nthe ophidia, (serpents,) an order peculiarly noxious.  It comes to a kind\r\nof climax in the feræ and raptores, which fulfil the function of butchers\r\namong land animals.  As we descend through tribes, families, genera,\r\nspecies, it becomes fainter and fainter, but never altogether vanishes.\r\nIn the dentirostres, for instance, we have in a subdued form the hooked\r\nbill and predaceous character of the raptores; to this tribe belongs the\r\nfamily of the shrikes, so deadly to all the lesser field birds.  In the\r\ngenus bos, we have, in the sub-typical group, the bison, “wild,\r\nrevengeful, and shewing an innate detestation of man.”  In equus, we\r\nhave, in the same situation, the zebra, which actually shews the stripes\r\nof the tiger, and is as remarkable for its wildness as its congeners, the\r\nhorse and ass, are for their docility and usefulness.  To quote again\r\nfrom Mr. Swainson, “the singular threatening aspect which the\r\ncaterpillars of the sphinx moth assume on being disturbed, is a\r\nremarkable modification of the terrific or evil nature which is impressed\r\nin one form or another, palpable or remote, upon all sub-typical groups;\r\nfor this division of the lepidopterous order is precisely of this\r\ndenomination.  In the pre-eminent type of this order of insects, the\r\nbutterflies, (papilionides,) our associations little prepare us for\r\nexpecting any trace of the evil principle; but here, too, there is a\r\nsub-typical division.  These,” says our naturalist, “are distinguished by\r\ntheir caterpillars being armed with formidable spines or prickles, which\r\nin general are possessed of some highly acrimonious or poisonous quality,\r\ncapable of injuring those who touch them.  It is only,” continues Mr.\r\nSwainson, “when extensive researches bring to light a uniformity of\r\nresults, that we can venture to believe they are so universal as to\r\ndeserve being ranked as primary laws.  Thus, when a celebrated\r\nentomologist denounced as impure the black and lurid beetles forming the\r\nsaprophagous petalocera of Mr. Macleay, a tribe living only upon putrid\r\nvegetable matter, and hiding themselves in their disgusting food, or in\r\ndark hollows of the earth, neither of these celebrated men suspected the\r\nabsolute fact, elicited from our analogies of this group, that this very\r\ntribe constituted the sub-typical group of one of the primary divisions\r\nof coleopterous insects: nor had they any suspicion that, by the filthy\r\nhabits and repulsive forms of these beetles, nature had intended that\r\nthey should be types or emblems of hundreds of other groups,\r\ndistinguished by peculiarities equally indicative of evil.  On the other\r\nhand, the thalerophagous petalocera, forming the typical group of the\r\nsame division, present us with all the perfections and habits belonging\r\nto their kind.  These families of beetles live only upon fresh\r\nvegetables; they are diurnal, and sport in the glare of day, pure in\r\ntheir food, elegant in their shapes, and beautiful in their colours.”\r\n{246}\r\n\r\nThe third type, (first of the three aberrant,) called by Mr. Swainson,\r\nthe _natatorial_, or aquatic, are chiefly remarkable for their bulk, the\r\ndisproportionate size of the head, and the absence, or slight development\r\nof the feet.  They partake of the predaceous and destructive character of\r\nthe adjoining sub-typical group, and the means of their predacity are\r\ngenerally found in the mouth alone.  In the primary division of the\r\nanimal kingdom, we find the type in the radiata, not one of which lives\r\nout of water.  In the vertebrata, it is in the fishes.  In both of these,\r\nfeet are totally wanting.  Descending to the class mammalia, we have this\r\ntype in the cetacea, which present a comparatively slight development of\r\nlimbs.  In the aves, as we have seen, the type is presented in the\r\nnatatores, whose name has been adopted as an appropriate term for all the\r\ncorresponding groups.  An enumeration of some other examples of the\r\nnatatorial type, as the cephalopoda (instanced in the cuttle-fish) in the\r\nmollusca; the crustacea (crabs, &c.) in the annulosa; the owls (which\r\noften duck for fish) in the raptores; the ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus,\r\n&c., among reptilia, will serve to bring the general character, and its\r\npervasion of the whole animal world, forcibly before the mind of the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThe next type is that of meanest and most imperfect organization, the\r\nlower termination of all groups, as the typical is the upper.  It is\r\ncalled by Mr. Swainson the suctorial, from a very generally prevalent\r\npeculiarity, that of drawing sustenance by suction.  The acrita, or\r\npolypes, among the sub-kingdoms; the intestina, among the annulosa; the\r\ntortoises, among the reptilia; the armadillo and scaly ant-eater, pig,\r\nmouse, jerboa, and kangaroo, among quadrupeds; the waders and\r\ntenuirostres, among birds; the coleoptera, (bug, louse, flea, &c.) among\r\ninsects; the gastrobranchus, among fishes; are examples which will\r\nillustrate the special characters of this type.  These are smallness,\r\nparticularly in the head and mouth, feebleness, and want of offensive\r\nprotection, defect of organs of mastication, considerable powers of swift\r\nmovement, and (often) a parasitic mode of living; while of negative\r\nqualities, there are, besides, indisposition to domestication, and an\r\nunsuitableness to serve as human food.\r\n\r\nThe rasorial type comprehends most of the animals which become\r\ndomesticated and useful to man, as, first, the fowls which give a name to\r\nthe type, the ungulata, and more particularly the ruminantia, among\r\nquadrupeds, and the dog among the feræ.  Gentleness, familiarity with\r\nman, and a peculiar approach to human intelligence, are the leading\r\nmental characteristics of animals of this type.  Amongst external\r\ncharacters, we generally find power of limbs and feet for locomotion on\r\nland, (to which the rasorial type is confined,) abundant tail and\r\nornaments for the head, whether in the form of tufts, crests, horns, or\r\nbony excrescences.  In the animal kingdom, the mollusca are the rasorial\r\ntype, which, however, only shews itself there in their soft and sluggish\r\ncharacter, and their being very generally edible.  In the ptilota, or\r\nwinged insects, the hymenopterous are the rasorial type, and it is not\r\ntherefore surprising to find amongst them the ants and bees, “the most\r\nsocial, intelligent, and in the latter case, most useful to man, of all\r\nthe annulose animals.”\r\n\r\nAs yet the speculations on representation are imperfect, in consequence\r\nof the novelty of the doctrine, and the defective state of our knowledge\r\nof animated nature.  It has, however, been so fully proved in the aves,\r\nand traced so clearly in other parts of the animal kingdom, and as a\r\ngeneral feature of that part of nature, that hardly a doubt can exist of\r\nits being universally applicable.  Even in the lowly forms of the acrita,\r\n(polypes,) the suctorial type of the animal kingdom, representation has\r\nbeen discerned, and with some remarkable results as to the history of our\r\nworld.  The acrita were the first forms of animal life upon earth, the\r\nstarting point of that great branch of organization.  Now, this\r\nsub-kingdom consists, like the rest, of five groups, (classes,) and these\r\nare respectively representations of the acrita itself, and the other four\r\nsub-kingdoms, which had not come into existence when the acrita were\r\nformed.  The polypi vaginati, in the crustaceous covering of the living\r\nmass, and their more or less articulated structure, represent the\r\n_annulosa_.  In the radiated forms of the rotifera, and the simple\r\nstructure of the polypi rudes, we are reminded of the _radiata_.  The\r\n_mollusca_ are typified in the soft, mucous, sluggish intestina.  And,\r\nfinally, in the fleshy living mass which surrounds the bony and hollow\r\naxis of the polypi natantes, we have a sketch of the _vertebrata_.  The\r\nacrita thus appear as a prophecy of the higher events of animal\r\ndevelopment.  They shew that the nobler orders of being, including man\r\nhimself, were contemplated from the first, and came into existence by\r\nvirtue of a law, the operation of which had commenced ages before their\r\nforms were realized.\r\n\r\nThe system of representation is therefore to be regarded as _a powerful\r\nadditional proof of the hypothesis of organic progress by virtue of law_.\r\nIt establishes the unity of animated nature and the definite character of\r\nits entire constitution.  It enables us to see how, under the flowing\r\nrobes of nature, where all looks arbitrary and accidental, there is an\r\nartificiality of the most rigid kind.  The natural, we now perceive,\r\nsinks into and merges in a Higher Artificial.  To adopt a comparison more\r\napt than dignified, we may be said to be placed here as insects are in a\r\ngarden of the old style.  Our first unassisted view is limited, and we\r\nperceive only the irregularities of the minute surface, and single shrubs\r\nwhich appear arbitrarily scattered.  But our view at length extending and\r\nbecoming more comprehensive, we begin to see parterres balancing each\r\nother, trees, statues, and arbours placed symmetrically, and that the\r\nwhole is an assemblage of parts mutually reflective.  It can scarcely be\r\nnecessary to point to the inference hence arising with regard to the\r\norigination of nature in some Power, of which man’s mind is a faint and\r\nhumble representation.  The insects of the garden, supposing them to be\r\ninvested with reasoning power, and aware how artificial are their own\r\nworks, might of course very reasonably conclude that, being in its\r\ntotality an artificial object, the garden was the work of some maker or\r\nartificer.  And so also must we conclude, when we attain a knowledge of\r\nthe artificiality which is at the basis of nature, that nature is wholly\r\nthe production of a Being resembling, but infinitely greater than\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nOrganic beings are, then, bound together in development, and in a system\r\nof both affinities and analogies.  Now, it will be asked, does this agree\r\nwith what we know of the geographical distribution of organic beings, and\r\nof the history of organic progress as delineated by geology?  Let us\r\nfirst advert to the geographical question.\r\n\r\nPlants, as is well known, require various kinds of soil, forms of\r\ngeographical surface, climate, and other conditions, for their existence.\r\nAnd it is everywhere found that, however isolated a particular spot may\r\nbe with regard to these conditions,—as a mountain top in a torrid\r\ncountry, the marsh round a salt spring far inland, or an island placed\r\nfar apart in the ocean,—appropriate plants have there taken up their\r\nabode.  But the torrid zone divides the two temperate regions from each\r\nother by the space of more than forty-six degrees, and the torrid and\r\ntemperate zones together form a much broader line of division between the\r\ntwo arctic regions.  The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and the Persian\r\nGulf, also divide the various portions of continent in the torrid and\r\ntemperate zones from each other.  Australia is also divided by a broad\r\nsea from the continent of Asia.  Thus there are various portions of the\r\nearth separated from each other in such a way as to preclude anything\r\nlike a general communication of the seeds of their respective plants\r\ntowards each other.  Hence arises an interesting question—Are the plants\r\nof the various isolated regions which enjoy a parity of climate and other\r\nconditions, identical or the reverse?  The answer is—that in such regions\r\nthe vegetation bears a general resemblance, but the _species_ are nearly\r\nall different, and there is even, in a considerable measure, a diversity\r\nof families.\r\n\r\nThe general facts have been thus stated: in the arctic and antarctic\r\nregions, and in those parts of lower latitudes, which, from their\r\nelevation, possess the same cold climate, there is always a similar or\r\nanalogous vegetation, but few species are common to the various\r\nsituations.  In like manner, the intertropical vegetation of Asia,\r\nAfrica, and America, are specifically different, though generally\r\nsimilar.  The southern region of America is equally diverse from that of\r\nAfrica, a country similar in clime, but separated by a vast extent of\r\nocean.  The vegetation of Australia, another region similarly placed in\r\nrespect of clime, is even more peculiar.  These facts are the more\r\nremarkable when we discover that, in most instances, the plants of one\r\nregion have thriven when transplanted to another of parallel clime.  This\r\nwould shew that parity of conditions does not lead to a parity of\r\nproductions so exact as to include identity of species, or even genera.\r\nBesides the various isolated regions here enumerated, there are some\r\nothers indicated by naturalists as exhibiting a vegetation equally\r\npeculiar.  Some of these are isolated by mountains, or the interposition\r\nof sandy wastes.  For example, the temperate region of the elder\r\ncontinent is divided about the centre of Asia, and the east of that line\r\nis different from the west.  So also is the same region divided in North\r\nAmerica by the Rocky Mountains.  Abyssinia and Nubia constitute another\r\ndistinct botanical region.  De Candolle enumerates in all twenty\r\nwell-marked portions of the earth’s surface which are peculiar with\r\nrespect to vegetation; a number which would be greatly increased if\r\nremote islands and isolated mountain ranges were to be included.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the zoology, we find precisely similar results, excepting\r\nthat man (with, perhaps, some of the less conspicuous forms of being) is\r\nuniversal, and that several tribes, as the bear and dog, appear to have\r\npassed by the land connexion from the arctic regions of the eastern to\r\nthose of the western hemisphere.  “With these exceptions,” says Dr.\r\nPrichard, “and without any others, as far as zoological researches have\r\nyet gone, it may be asserted that no individual species are common to\r\ndistant regions.  In parallel climates, analogous species replace each\r\nother; sometimes, but not frequently, the same genus is found in two\r\nseparate continents; but the species which are natives of one region are\r\nnot identical with corresponding races indigenous in the opposite\r\nhemisphere.\r\n\r\n“A similar result arises when we compare the three great intertropical\r\nregions, as well as the extreme spaces of the three great continents,\r\nwhich advance into the temperate climates of the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n“Thus, the tribes of simiæ, (monkeys,) of the dog and cat kinds, of\r\npachyderms, including elephants, tapirs, rhinoceroses, hogs, of bats, of\r\nsaurian and ophidian reptiles, as well of birds and other terrene\r\nanimals, are all different in the three great continents.  In the lower\r\ndepartments of the mammiferous family, we find that the bruta, or\r\nedendata, (sloths, armadillos, &c.,) of Africa, are differently organized\r\nfrom those of America, and these again from the tribes found in the\r\nMalayan archipelago and Terra Australis.” {255}\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the diversity between the similar regions of\r\nAfrica, Asia, and America, is occasioned in all instances by any\r\ndisqualification of these countries to support precisely the same genera\r\nor species.  The ox, horse, goat, &c., of the elder continent have\r\nthriven and extended themselves in the new, and many of the indigenous\r\ntribes of America would no doubt flourish in corresponding climates in\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa.  It has, however, been remarked by naturalists\r\nunacquainted with the Macleay system, that the larger and more powerful\r\nanimals of their respective orders belong to the elder continent, and\r\nthat thus the animals of America, unlike the features of inanimate\r\nnature, appear to be upon a small scale.  The swiftest and most agile\r\nanimals, and a large proportion of those most useful to man, are also\r\nnatives of the elder continent.  On the other hand, the bulk of the\r\nedentata, a group remarkable for defects and meanness of organization,\r\nare American.  The zoology of America may be said, upon the whole, to\r\nrecede from that of Asia, “and perhaps in a greater degree,” adds Dr.\r\nPrichard, “from that of Africa.”  A much greater recession is, however,\r\nobserved in both the botany and zoology of Australia.\r\n\r\nThere “we do not find, in the great masses of vegetation, either the\r\nmajesty of the virgin forests of America, or the variety and elegance of\r\nthose of Asia, or the delicacy and freshness of the woods of our\r\ntemperate countries of Europe.  The vegetation is generally gloomy and\r\nsad; it has the aspect of our evergreens or heaths; the plants are for\r\nthe most part woody; the leaves of nearly all the plants are linear,\r\nlanceolated, small, coriaceous, and spinescent.  The grasses, which\r\nelsewhere are generally soft and flexible, participate in the stiffness\r\nof the other vegetables.  The greater part of the plants of New Holland\r\nbelong to new genera; and those included in the genera already known are\r\nof new species.  The natural families which prevail are those of the\r\nheaths, the proteæ, compositæ, leguminosæ, and myrthoideæ; the larger\r\ntrees all belong to the last family.” {257}\r\n\r\nThe prevalent animals of Australia are not less peculiar.  It is well\r\nknown that none above the marsupialia, or pouched animals, are native to\r\nit.  The most conspicuous are these marsupials, which exist in great\r\nvarieties here, though unknown in the elder continent, and only found in\r\na few mean forms in America.  Next to them are the monotremata, which are\r\nentirely peculiar to this portion of the earth.  Now these are animals at\r\nthe bottom of the mammiferous class, adjoining to that of birds, of whose\r\ncharacter and organization the monotremata largely partake, the\r\nornithorynchus presenting the bill and feet of a duck, producing its\r\nyoung in eggs, and having, like birds, a clavicle between the two\r\nshoulders.  The birds of Australia vary in structure and plumage, but all\r\nhave some singularity about them—the swan, for instance, is black.  The\r\ncountry abounds in reptiles, and the prevalent fishes are of the early\r\nkinds, having a cartilaginous structure.\r\n\r\nAltogether, the plants and animals of this minor continent convey the\r\nimpression of an early system of things, such as might be displayed in\r\nother parts of the earth about the time of the oolite.  In connexion with\r\nthis circumstance, it is a fact of some importance, that the geognostic\r\ncharacter of Australia, its vast arid plains, its little diversified\r\nsurface and consequent paucity of streams, and the very slight\r\ndevelopment of volcanic rock on its surface, seem to indicate a system of\r\nphysical conditions, such as we may suppose to have existed elsewhere in\r\nthe oolitic era: perhaps we see the chalk formation preparing there in\r\nthe vast coral beds frontiering the coast.  Australia thus appears as a\r\nportion of the earth which has, from some unknown causes, been belated in\r\nits physical and organic development.  And certainly the greater part of\r\nits surface is not fitted to be an advantageous place of residence for\r\nbeings above the marsupialia, and judging from analogy, it may yet be\r\nsubjected to a series of changes in the highest degree inconvenient to\r\nany human beings who may have settled upon it.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions regarding the geography of organic nature, may be\r\nthus stated.  (1.) There are numerous distinct foci of organic production\r\nthroughout the earth.  (2.) These have everywhere advanced in accordance\r\nwith the local conditions of climate &c., as far as at least the class\r\nand order are concerned, a diversity taking place in the lower\r\ngradations.  No physical or geographical reason appearing for this\r\ndiversity, we are led to infer that, (3,) it is the result of minute and\r\ninappreciable causes giving the law of organic development a particular\r\ndirection in the lower subdivisions of the two kingdoms.  (4.)\r\nDevelopment has not gone on to equal results in the various continents,\r\nbeing most advanced in the eastern continent, next in the western, and\r\nleast in Australia, this inequality being perhaps the result of the\r\ncomparative antiquity of the various regions, geologically and\r\ngeographically.\r\n\r\nIt must at the same time be admitted that the line of organic development\r\nhas nowhere required for its advance the whole of the families\r\ncomprehended in the two kingdoms, seeing that some of these are confined\r\nto one continent, and some to another, without a conceivable possibility\r\nof one having been connected with the other in the way of ancestry.  The\r\ntwo great families of quadrumana, cebidæ and simiadæ, are a noted\r\ninstance, the one being exclusively American, while the other belongs\r\nentirely to the old world.  There are many other cases in which the full\r\ncircular group can only be completed by taking subdivisions from various\r\ncontinents.  This would seem to imply that, while the entire system is so\r\nremarkable for its unity, it has nevertheless been produced in lines\r\ngeographically detached, these lines perhaps consisting of particular\r\ntypical groups placed in an independent succession, or of two or more of\r\nthese groups.  And for this idea there is, even in the present imperfect\r\nstate of our knowledge of animated nature, some countenance in\r\nascertained facts, the birds of Australia, for example, being chiefly of\r\nthe suctorial type, while it may be presumed that the observation as to\r\nthe predominance of the useful animals in the Old World, is not much\r\ndifferent from saying that the rasorial type is there peculiarly\r\nabundant.  It does not appear that the idea of independent lines,\r\nconsisting of particular types, or sets of types, is necessarily\r\ninconsistent with the general hypothesis, as nothing yet ascertained of\r\nthe Macleay system forbids their having an independent set of affinities.\r\nOn this subject, however, there is as yet much obscurity, and it must be\r\nleft to future inquirers to clear it up.\r\n\r\nWe must now call to mind that the geographical distribution of plants and\r\nanimals was very different in the geological ages from what it is now.\r\nDown to a time not long antecedent to man, the same vegetation overspread\r\nevery clime, and a similar uniformity marked the zoology.  This is\r\nconceived by M. Brogniart, with great plausibility, to have been the\r\nresult of a uniformity of climate, produced by the as yet unexhausted\r\neffect of the internal heat of the earth upon its surface; whereas\r\nclimate has since depended chiefly on external sources of heat, as\r\nmodified by the various meteorological influences.  However the early\r\nuniform climate was produced, certain it is that, from about the close of\r\nthe geological epoch, plants and animals have been dispersed over the\r\nglobe with a regard to their particular characters, and specimens of both\r\nare found so isolated in particular situations, as utterly to exclude the\r\nidea that they came thither from any common centre.  It may be\r\nasked,—Considering that, in the geological epoch, species are not limited\r\nto particular regions, and that since the close of that epoch, they are\r\nvery peculiarly limited, are we to presume the present organisms of the\r\nworld to have been created _ab initio_ after that time?  To this it may\r\nbe answered,—Not necessarily, as it so happens that animals begin to be\r\nmuch varied, or to appear in a considerable variety of species, towards\r\nthe close of the geological history.  It may have been that the\r\nmultitudes of locally peculiar species only came into being after the\r\nuniform climate had passed away.  It may have only been when a varied\r\nclimate arose, that the originally few species branched off into the\r\npresent extensive variety.\r\n\r\nA question of a very interesting kind will now probably arise in the\r\nreader’s mind—_What place or status is assigned to man in the new natural\r\nsystem_.  Before going into this inquiry, it is necessary to advert to\r\nseveral particulars of the natural system not yet noticed.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in particular, to ascertain the grades which exist in\r\nthe classification of animals.  In the line of the aves, Mr. Swainson\r\nfinds these to be nine, the species pica, for example, being thus\r\nindicated:—\r\n\r\nKingdom                    Animalia.\r\nSub-kingdom                Vertebrata.\r\nClass                      Aves.\r\nOrder                      Incessores.\r\nTribe                      Conirostres.\r\nFamily                     Corvidæ.\r\nSub-family                 Corvinæ.\r\nGenus                      Corvus.\r\nSub-genus, or species      Pica.\r\n\r\nThis brings us down to species, the subdivision where intermarriage or\r\nbreeding is usually considered as natural to animals, and where a\r\nresemblance of offspring to parents is generally persevered in.  The dog,\r\nfor instance, is a species, because all dogs can breed together, and the\r\nprogeny partakes of the appearances of the parents.  The human race is\r\nheld as a species, primarily for the same reasons.  Species, however, is\r\nliable to another subdivision, which naturalists call variety; and\r\nvariety appears to be subject to exactly the same system of\r\n_representation_ which have been traced in species and higher\r\ndenominations.  In canis, for instance, the bull-dog and mastiff\r\nrepresent the ferocious sub-typical group; the waterdog is natatorial; we\r\nsee the speed and length of muzzle of the suctorial group in the\r\ngreyhound; and the bushy tail and gentle and serviceable character of the\r\nrasorial in the shepherd’s dog and spaniel.  Even the striped and spotted\r\nskin of the tiger and panther is reproduced in the more ferocious kind of\r\ndogs—an indication of a fundamental connexion between physical and mental\r\nqualities which we have also seen in the zebra, and which is likewise\r\ndisplayed in the predominance of a yellow colour in the vultures and owls\r\nin common with the lion and his congeners.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means clearly made out that this system of nine gradations\r\nover and above that of variety applies in all departments of nature.  On\r\nthe contrary, even Mr. Swainson gives series in which several of them are\r\nomitted.  It may be that, in some departments of nature, variation from\r\nthe class or order has gone down into fewer shades than in others; or it\r\nmay be, that many of the variations have not survived till our era, or\r\nhave not been as yet detected by naturalists; in either of which cases\r\nthere may be a necessity for shortening the series by the omission of one\r\nor two grades, as for instance _tribe_ or _sub-family_.  This, however,\r\nis much to be regretted, as it introduces an irregularity into the\r\nnatural system, and consequently throws a difficulty and doubt in the way\r\nof our investigating it.  With these preliminary remarks, I shall proceed\r\nto inquire what is the natural status of man.\r\n\r\nThat man’s place is to be looked for in the class mammalia and\r\nsub-kingdom vertebrata admits of no doubt, from his possessing both the\r\ncharacters on which these divisions are founded.  When we descend,\r\nhowever, below the _class_, we find no settled views on the subject\r\namongst naturalists.  Mr. Swainson, who alone has given a review of the\r\nanimal kingdom on the Macleay system, unfortunately writes on this\r\nsubject in a manner which excites a suspicion as to his judgment.  His\r\narrangement of the first or typical order of the mammalia is therefore to\r\nbe received with great hesitation.  It is as follows:—\r\n\r\nTypical          Quadrumana      Pre-eminently organized for\r\n                                 grasping.\r\nSub-typical      Feræ            Claws retractile; carnivorous.\r\nNatatorial       Cetacea         Pre-eminently aquatic; feet very\r\n                                 short.\r\nSuctorial        Glires          Muzzle lengthened and pointed.\r\nRasorial         Ungulata        Crests and other processes on the\r\n                                 head.\r\n\r\nHe then takes the quadrumana, and places it in the following\r\narrangement:—\r\n\r\nTypical          Simiadæ              (Monkeys of Old World.)\r\nSub-typical      Cebidæ               (Monkeys of New World.)\r\nNatatorial       Unknown\r\nSuctorial        Vespertilionidæ      (Bats.)\r\nRasorial         Lemuridæ             (Lemurs.)\r\n\r\nHe considers the simiadæ as a complete circle, and argues thence that\r\nthere is no room in the range of the animal kingdom for man.  Man, he\r\nsays, is not a constituent part of any circle, for, if he were, there\r\nought to be other animals on each hand having affinity to him, whereas\r\nthere are none, the resemblance of the orangs being one of mere analogy.\r\nMr. Swainson therefore considers our race as standing apart, and forming\r\na link between the unintelligent order of beings and the angels!  And\r\nthis in spite of the glaring fact that, in our teeth, hands, and other\r\nfeatures grounded on by naturalists as characteristic, we do not differ\r\nmore from the simiadæ than the bats do from the lemurs—in spite also of\r\nthat resemblance of analogy to the orangs which he himself admits, and\r\nwhich, at the least, must be held to imply a certain relation.  He also\r\noverlooks that, though there may be no room for man in the circle of the\r\nsimiadæ, (this, indeed, is quite true,) there may be in the order, where\r\nhe actually leaves a place entirely blank, or only to be filled up, as he\r\nsuggests, by mermen! {266}  Another argument in his arrangement is, that\r\nit leaves the grades of classification very much abridged, there being at\r\nthe most seven instead of nine.  But serious argument on a theory so\r\npreposterous may be considered as nearly thrown away.  I shall therefore\r\nat once proceed to suggest a new arrangement of this portion of the\r\nanimal kingdom, in which man is allowed the place to which he is\r\nzoologically entitled.\r\n\r\nI propose that the typical order of the mammalia should be designated\r\ncheirotheria, from the sole character which is universal amongst them,\r\ntheir possessing hands, and with a regard to that pre-eminent\r\nqualification for grasping which has been ascribed to them—an analogy to\r\nthe perching habit of the typical order of birds, which is worthy of\r\nparticular notice.  The tribes of the cheirotheria I arrange as follows:—\r\n\r\nTypical          Bimana.\r\nSub-typical      Simiadæ.\r\nNatatorial       Vespertilionidæ.\r\nSuctorial        Lemuridæ.\r\nRasorial         Cebidæ.\r\n\r\nHere man is put into the typical place, as the genuine head, not only of\r\nthis order, but of the whole animal world.  The double affinity which is\r\nrequisite is obtained, for here he has the simiadæ on one hand, and the\r\ncebidæ on the other.  The five tribes of the order are completed, the\r\nvespertilionidæ being shifted (provisionally) into the natatorial place,\r\nfor which their appropriateness is so far evidenced by the aquatic habits\r\nof several of the tribe, and the lemuridæ into the suctorial, to which\r\ntheir length of muzzle and remarkable saltatory power are highly\r\nsuitable.  At the same time, the simiadæ are degraded from the typical\r\nplace, to which they have no sort of pretension, and placed where their\r\nmean and mischievous character seem to require; the cebidæ again being\r\nassigned that situation which their comparatively inoffensive\r\ndispositions, their arboreal habits, and their extraordinary development\r\nof the tail, (which with them is like a fifth hand,) render so proper.\r\n\r\nThe zoological status thus assigned to the human race is precisely what\r\nmight be expected.  In order to understand its full value, it is\r\nnecessary to observe how the various type peculiarities operate in fixing\r\nthe character of the animals ranked in them.  It is easy to conceive that\r\nthey must be, in some instances, much mixed up with each other, and\r\nconsequently obscured.  If an animal, for example, is the suctorial\r\nmember of a circle of species, forming the natatorial type of genera,\r\nforming a family or sub-family which in its turn is rasorial, its\r\nqualities must evidently be greatly mingled and ill to define.  But, on\r\nthe other hand, if we take the rapacious or sub-typical group of birds,\r\nand look in it for the tribe which is again the rapacious or sub-typical\r\ngroup of its order, we may expect to find the qualities of that group\r\nexalted or intensified, and accordingly made the more conspicuous.  Such\r\nis really the case with the vultures, in the rapacious birds, a family\r\nremarkable above all of their order for their carnivorous and foul\r\nhabits.  So, also, if we take the typical group of the birds, the\r\nincessores or perchers, and look in it for its typical group, the\r\nconirostres, and seek there again for the typical family of that group,\r\nthe corvidæ, we may expect to find a very marked superiority in\r\norganization and character.  Such is really the case.  “The crow,” says\r\nMr. Swainson, “unites in itself a greater number of properties than are\r\nto be found individually in any other genus of birds; as if in fact it\r\nhad taken from all the other orders a portion of their peculiar\r\nqualities, for the purpose of exhibiting in what manner they could be\r\ncombined.  From the rapacious birds this “type of types,” as the crow has\r\nbeen justly called, takes the power of soaring in the air, and of seizing\r\nupon living birds, like the hawks, while its habit of devouring putrid\r\nsubstances, and picking out the eyes of young animals, is borrowed from\r\nthe vultures.  From the scansorial or climbing order it takes the faculty\r\nof picking the ground, and discovering its food when hidden from the eye,\r\nwhile the parrot family gives it the taste for vegetable food, and\r\nfurnishes it with great cunning, sagacity, and powers of imitation, even\r\nto counterfeiting the human voice.  Next come the order of waders, who\r\nimpart their quota to the perfection of the crow by giving it great\r\npowers of flight, and perfect facility in walking, such being among the\r\nchief attributes of the suctorial order.  Lastly, the aquatic birds\r\ncontribute their portion, by giving this terrestrial bird the power of\r\nfeeding not only on fish, which are their peculiar food, but actually of\r\noccasionally catching it. {270}  In this wonderful manner do we find the\r\ncrow partially invested with the united properties of all other birds,\r\nwhile in its own order, that of the incessores or perchers, it stands the\r\npre-eminent type.  We cannot also fail to regard it as a remarkable proof\r\nof the superior organization and character of the corvidæ, that they are\r\nadapted for all climates, and accordingly found all over the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Swainson’s description of the zoological status of the crow, written\r\nwithout the least design of throwing any light upon that of man,\r\nevidently does so in a remarkable degree.  It prepares us to expect in\r\nthe place among the mammalia, corresponding to that of the corvidæ in the\r\naves, a being or set of beings possessing a remarkable concentration of\r\nqualities from all the other groups of their order, but in general\r\ncharacter as far above the corvidæ as a typical group is above an\r\naberrant one, the mammalia above the aves.  Can any of the simiadæ\r\npretend to such a place, narrowly and imperfectly endowed as these\r\ncreatures are—a mean reflection apparently of something higher?\r\nAssuredly not, and in this consideration alone Mr. Swainson’s arrangement\r\nmust fall to the ground.  To fill worthily so lofty a station in the\r\nanimated families man alone is competent.  In him only is to be found\r\nthat concentration of qualities from all the other groups of his order\r\nwhich has been described as marking the corvidæ.  That grasping power,\r\nwhich has been selected as the leading physical quality of his order, is\r\nnowhere so beautifully or so powerfully developed as in his hand.  The\r\nintelligence and teachableness of the simiadæ rise to a climax in his\r\npre-eminent mental nature.  His sub-analogy to the feræ is marked by his\r\ncanine teeth, and the universality of his rapacity, for where is the\r\ndepartment of animated nature which he does not without scruple sacrifice\r\nto his convenience?  With sanguinary, he has also gentle and domesticable\r\ndispositions, thus reflecting the characters of the ungulata, (the\r\nrasorial type of the class,) to which we perhaps see a further analogy in\r\nthe use which he makes of the surface of the earth as a source of food.\r\nTo the aquatic type his love of maritime adventure very readily\r\nassimilates him; and how far the suctorial is represented in his nature\r\nit is hardly necessary to say.  As the corvidæ, too, are found in every\r\npart of the earth—almost the only one of the inferior animals which has\r\nbeen acknowledged as universal—so do we find man.  He thrives in all\r\nclimates, and with regard to style of living, can adapt himself to an\r\ninfinitely greater diversity of circumstances than any other animated\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nMan, then, considered zoologically, and without regard to the distinct\r\ncharacter assigned to him by theology, simply takes his place as the type\r\nof all types of the animal kingdom, the true and unmistakable head of\r\nanimated nature upon this earth.  It will readily occur that some more\r\nparticular investigations into the ranks of types might throw additional\r\nlight on man’s status, and perhaps his nature; and such light we may hope\r\nto obtain when the philosophy of zoology shall have been studied as it\r\ndeserves.  Perhaps some such diagram as the one given on the next page\r\nwill be found to be an approximation to the expression of the merely\r\nnatural or secular grade of man in comparison with other animals.\r\n\r\n                         [Picture: Diagram] {274}\r\n\r\nHere the upright lines, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, may represent the comparative\r\nheight and grade of organization of both the five sub-kingdoms, and the\r\nfive classes of each of these; 5 being the vertebrata in the one case,\r\nand the mammalia in the other.  The difference between the height of the\r\nline 1 and the line 5 gives an idea of the difference of being the head\r\ntype of the aves, (corvidæ,) and the head type of the mammalia, (bimana;)\r\n_a. b. c. d_.  5, again, represent the five groups of the first order of\r\nthe mammalia; _a_, being the organic structure of the highest simia, and\r\n5, that of man.  A set of tangent lines of this kind may yet prove one of\r\nthe most satisfactory means of ascertaining the height and breadth of the\r\npsychology of our species.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked,—Is the existing human race the only species designed to\r\noccupy the grade to which it is here referred?  Such a question evidently\r\nought not to be answered rashly; and I shall therefore confine myself to\r\nthe admission that, judging by analogy, we might expect to see several\r\nvarieties of the being, homo.  There is no other family approaching to\r\nthis in importance, which presents but one species.  The corvidæ, our\r\nparallel in aves, consist of several distinct genera and sub-genera.  It\r\nis startling to find such an appearance of imperfection in the circle to\r\nwhich man belongs, and the ideas which rise in consequence are not less\r\nstartling.  Is our race but the initial of the grand crowning type?  Are\r\nthere yet to be species superior to us in organization, purer in feeling,\r\nmore powerful in device and act, and who shall take a rule over us!\r\nThere is in this nothing improbable on other grounds.  The present race,\r\nrude and impulsive as it is, is perhaps the best adapted to the present\r\nstate of things in the world; but the external world goes through slow\r\nand gradual changes, which may leave it in time a much serener field of\r\nexistence.  There may then be occasion for a nobler type of humanity,\r\nwhich shall complete the zoological circle on this planet, and realize\r\nsome of the dreams of the purest spirits of the present race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE human race is known to consist of numerous nations, displaying\r\nconsiderable differences of external form and colour, and speaking in\r\ngeneral different languages.  This has been the case since the\r\ncommencement of written record.  It is also ascertained that the external\r\npeculiarities of particular nations do not rapidly change.  There is\r\nrather a tendency to a persistency of type in all lines of descent,\r\ninsomuch that a subordinate admixture of various type is usually\r\nobliterated in a few generations.  Numerous as the varieties are, they\r\nhave all been found classifiable under five leading ones:—1.  The\r\nCaucasian or Indo-European, which extends from India into Europe and\r\nNorthern Africa; 2.  The Mongolian, which occupies Northern and Eastern\r\nAsia; 3.  The Malayan, which extends from the Ultra-Gangetic Peninsula\r\ninto the numerous islands of the South Sea and Pacific; 4.  The Negro,\r\nchiefly confined to Africa; 5.  The aboriginal American.  Each of these\r\nis distinguished by certain general features of so marked a kind, as to\r\ngive rise to a supposition that they have had distinct or independent\r\norigins.  Of these peculiarities, colour is the most conspicuous: the\r\nCaucasians are generally white, the Mongolians yellow, the Negroes black,\r\nand the Americans red.  The opposition of two of these in particular,\r\nwhite and black, is so striking, that of them, at least, it seems almost\r\nnecessary to suppose separate origins.  Of late years, however, the whole\r\nof this question has been subjected to a rigorous investigation, and it\r\nhas been successfully shewn that the human race might have had one\r\norigin, for anything that can be inferred from external peculiarities.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this inquiry, {278} that colour and other physiological\r\ncharacters are of a more superficial and accidental nature than was at\r\none time supposed.  One fact is at the very first extremely startling,\r\nthat there are nations, such as the inhabitants of Hindostan, known to be\r\none in descent, which nevertheless contain groups of people of almost all\r\nshades of colour, and likewise discrepant in other of those important\r\nfeatures on which much stress has been laid.  Some other facts, which I\r\nmay state in brief terms, are scarcely less remarkable.  In Africa, there\r\nare Negro nations,—that is, nations of intensely black complexion, as the\r\nJolofs, Mandingoes, and Kafirs, whose features and limbs are as elegant\r\nas those of the best European nations.  While we have no proof of Negro\r\nraces becoming white in the course of generations, the converse may be\r\nheld as established, for there are Arab and Jewish families of ancient\r\nsettlement in Northern Africa, who have become as black as the other\r\ninhabitants.  There are also facts which seem to shew the possibility of\r\na natural transition by generation from the black to the white\r\ncomplexion, and from the white to the black.  True whites (apart from\r\nAlbinoes) are not unfrequently born among the Negroes, and the tendency\r\nto this singularity is transmitted in families.  There is, at least, one\r\nauthentic instance of a set of perfectly black children being born to an\r\nArab couple, in whose ancestry no such blood had intermingled.  This\r\noccurred in the valley of the Jordan, where it is remarkable that the\r\nArab population in general have flatter features, darker skins, and\r\ncoarser hair, than any other tribes of the same nation. {280}\r\n\r\nThe style of living is ascertained to have a powerful effect in modifying\r\nthe human figure in the course of generations, and this even in its\r\nosseous structure.  About two hundred years ago, a number of people were\r\ndriven by a barbarous policy from the counties of Antrim and Down, in\r\nIreland, towards the sea-coast, where they have ever since been settled,\r\nbut in unusually miserable circumstances, even for Ireland; and the\r\nconsequence is, that they exhibit peculiar features of the most repulsive\r\nkind, projecting jaws with large open mouths, depressed noses, high cheek\r\nbones, and bow legs, together with an extremely diminutive stature.\r\nThese, with an abnormal slenderness of the limbs, are the outward marks\r\nof a low and barbarous condition all over the world; it is particularly\r\nseen in the Australian aborigines.  On the other hand, the beauty of the\r\nhigher ranks in England is very remarkable, being, in the main, as\r\nclearly a result of good external conditions.  “Coarse, unwholesome, and\r\nill-prepared food,” says Buffon, “makes the human race degenerate.  All\r\nthose people who live miserably are ugly and ill-made.  Even in France,\r\nthe country people are not so beautiful as those who live in towns; and I\r\nhave often remarked that in those villages where the people are richer\r\nand better fed than in others, the men are likewise more handsome, and\r\nhave better countenances.”  He might have added, that elegant and\r\ncommodious dwellings, cleanly habits, comfortable clothing, and being\r\nexposed to the open air only as much as health requires, cooperate with\r\nfood in increasing the elegance of a race of human beings.\r\n\r\nSubject only to these modifying agencies, there is, as has been said, a\r\nremarkable persistency in national features and forms, insomuch that a\r\nsingle individual thrown into a family different from himself is absorbed\r\nin it, and all trace of him lost after a few generations.  But while\r\nthere is such a persistency to ordinary observation, it would also appear\r\nthat nature has a power of producing new varieties, though this is only\r\ndone rarely.  Such novelties of type abound in the vegetable world, are\r\nseen more rarely in the animal circle, and perhaps are least frequent of\r\noccurrence in our own race.  There is a noted instance in the production,\r\non a New England farm, of a variety of sheep with unusually short legs,\r\nwhich was kept up by breeding, on account of the convenience in that\r\ncountry of having sheep which are unable to jump over low fences.  The\r\nstarting and main taming a _breed_ of cattle, that is, a variety marked\r\nby some desirable peculiarity, are familiar to a large class of persons.\r\nIt appears only necessary, when a variety has been thus produced, that a\r\nunion should take place between individuals similarly characterized, in\r\norder to establish it.  Early in the last century, a man named Lambert,\r\nwas born in Suffolk, with semi-horny excrescences of about half an inch\r\nlong, thickly growing all over his body.  The peculiarity was transmitted\r\nto his children, and was last heard of in a third generation.  The\r\npeculiarity of six fingers on the hand and six toes on the feet, appears\r\nin like manner in families which have no record or tradition of such a\r\npeculiarity having affected them at any former period, and it is then\r\nsometimes seen to descend through several generations.  It was Mr.\r\nLawrence’s opinion, that a pair, in which both parties were so\r\ndistinguished, might be the progenitors of a new variety of the race who\r\nwould be thus marked in all future time.  It is not easy to surmise the\r\ncauses which operate in producing such varieties.  Perhaps they are\r\nsimply types in nature, _possible to be realized under certain\r\nappropriate conditions_, but which conditions are such as altogether to\r\nelude notice.  I might cite as examples of such possible types, the rise\r\nof whites amongst the Negroes, the occurrence of the family of black\r\nchildren in the valley of the Jordan, and the comparatively frequent\r\nbirth of red-haired children amongst not only the Mongolian and Malayan\r\nfamilies, but amongst the Negroes.  We are ignorant of the laws of\r\nvariety-production; but we see it going on as a principle in nature, and\r\nit is obviously favourable to the supposition that all the great families\r\nof men are of one stock.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of the modern study of the languages of nations is to the\r\nsame point.  The last fifty years have seen this study elevated to the\r\ncharacter of a science, and the light which it throws upon the history of\r\nmankind is of a most remarkable nature.\r\n\r\nFollowing a natural analogy, philologists have thrown the earth’s\r\nlanguages into a kind of classification: a number bearing a considerable\r\nresemblance to each other, and in general geographically near, are styled\r\na _group_ or _sub-family_; several groups, again, are associated as a\r\n_family_, with regard to more general features of resemblance.  Six\r\nfamilies are spoken of.\r\n\r\nThe Indo-European family nearly coincides in geographical limits with\r\nthose which have been assigned to that variety of mankind which generally\r\nshews a fair complexion, called the Caucasian variety.  It may be said to\r\ncommence in India, and thence to stretch through Persia into Europe, the\r\nwhole of which it occupies, excepting Hungary, the Basque provinces of\r\nSpain, and Finland.  Its sub-families are the Sanskrit, or ancient\r\nlanguage of India, the Persian, the Slavonic, Celtic, Gothic, and\r\nPelasgian.  The Slavonic includes the modern languages of Russia and\r\nPoland.  Under the Gothic, are (1) the Scandinavian tongues, the Norske,\r\nSwedish, and Danish; and (2) the Teutonic, to which belong the modern\r\nGerman, the Dutch, and our own Anglo-Saxon.  I give the name of Pelasgian\r\nto the group scattered along the north shores of the Mediterranean, the\r\nGreek and Latin, including the modifications of the latter under the\r\nnames of Italian, Spanish, &c.  The Celtic was from two to three thousand\r\nyears ago, the speech of a considerable tribe dwelling in Western Europe;\r\nbut these have since been driven before superior nations into a few\r\ncorners, and are now only to be found in the highlands of Scotland,\r\nIreland, Wales, Cornwall, and certain parts of France.  The Gaelic of\r\nScotland, Erse of Ireland, and the Welsh, are the only living branches of\r\nthis sub-family of languages.\r\n\r\nThe resemblances amongst languages are of two kinds,—identity of words,\r\nand identity of grammatical forms; the latter being now generally\r\nconsidered as the most important towards the argument.  When we inquire\r\ninto the first kind of affinity among the languages of the Indo-European\r\nfamily, we are surprised at the great number of common terms which exist\r\namongst them, and these referring to such primary ideas, as to leave no\r\ndoubt of their having all been derived from a common source.  Colonel\r\nVans Kennedy presents nine hundred words common to the Sanskrit and other\r\nlanguages of the same family.  In the Sanskrit and Persian, we find\r\nseveral which require no sort of translation to an English reader, as\r\n_pader_, _mader_, _sunu_, _dokhter_, _brader_, _mand_, _vidhava_;\r\nlikewise _asthi_, a bone, (Greek, _ostoun_;) _denta_, a tooth, (Latin,\r\n_dens_, _dentis_;) _eyeumen_, the eye; _brouwa_, the eye-brow, (German,\r\n_braue_;) _nasa_, the nose; _karu_, the hand, (Gr. _cheir_;) _genu_, the\r\nknee, (Lat. _genu_;) _ped_, the foot, (Lat. _pes_, _pedis_;) _hrti_, the\r\nheart; _jecur_, the liver, (Lat. _jecur_;) _stara_, a star; _gela_, cold,\r\n(Lat. _gelu_, ice;) _aghni_, fire, (Lat. _ignis_;) _dhara_, the earth,\r\n(Lat. _terra_, Gaelic, _tir_;) _arrivi_, a river; _nau_, a ship, (Gr.\r\n_naus_, Lat. _navis_;) _ghau_, a cow; _sarpam_, a serpent.\r\n\r\nThe inferences from these verbal coincidences were confirmed in a\r\nstriking manner when Bopp and others investigated the grammatical\r\nstructure of this family of languages.  Dr. Wiseman pronounces that the\r\ngreat philologist just named, “by a minute and sagacious analysis of the\r\nSanskrit verb, compared with the conjugational system of the other\r\nmembers of this family, left no doubt of their intimate and positive\r\naffinity.”  It was now discovered that the peculiar terminations or\r\ninflections by which persons are expressed throughout the verbs of nearly\r\nthe whole of these languages, have their foundations in pronouns; the\r\npronoun was simply placed at the end, and thus became an inflexion.  “By\r\nan analysis of the Sanskrit pronouns, the elements of those existing in\r\nall the other languages were cleared of their anomalies; the verb\r\nsubstantive, which in Latin is composed of fragments referable to two\r\ndistinct roots, here found both existing in regular form; the Greek\r\nconjugations, with all their complicated machinery of middle voice,\r\naugments, and reduplications, were here found and illustrated in a\r\nvariety of ways, which a few years ago would have appeared chimerical.\r\nEven our own language may sometimes receive light from the study of\r\ndistant members of our family.  Where, for instance, are we to seek for\r\nthe root of our comparative _better_?  Certainly not in its positive,\r\ngood, nor in the Teutonic dialects in which the same anomaly exists.  But\r\nin the Persian we have precisely the same comparative, _behter_, with\r\nexactly the same signification, regularly formed from its positive _beh_,\r\ngood.” {287}\r\n\r\nThe second great family is the _Syro-Phœnician_, comprising the Hebrew,\r\nSyro-Chaldaic, Arabic, and Gheez or Abyssinian, being localized\r\nprincipally in the countries to the west and south of the Mediterranean.\r\nBeyond them, again, is the African family, which, as far as research has\r\ngone, seems to be in like manner marked by common features, both verbal\r\nand grammatical.  The fourth is the Polynesian family, extending from\r\nMadagascar on the west through all the Indian Archipelago, besides taking\r\nin the Malayan dialect from the continent of India, and comprehending\r\nAustralia and the islands of the western portion of the Pacific.  This\r\nfamily, however, bears such an affinity to that next to be described,\r\nthat Dr. Leyden and some others do not give it a distinct place as a\r\nfamily of languages.\r\n\r\nThe fifth family is the Chinese, embracing a large part of China, and\r\nmost of the regions of Central and Northern Asia.  The leading features\r\nof the Chinese are, its consisting altogether of monosyllables, and being\r\ndestitute of all grammatical forms, except certain arrangements and\r\naccentuations, which vary the sense of particular words.  It is also\r\ndeficient in some of the consonants most conspicuous in other languages,\r\nb, d, r, v, and z; so that this people can scarcely pronounce our speech\r\nin such a way as to be intelligible: for example, the word Christus they\r\ncall _Kuliss-ut-oo-suh_.  The Chinese, strange to say, though they early\r\nattained to a remarkable degree of civilization, and have preceded the\r\nEuropeans in many of the most important inventions, have a language which\r\nresembles that of children, or deaf and dumb people.  The sentence of\r\nshort, simple, unconnected words, in which an infant amongst us attempts\r\nto express some of its wants and its ideas—the equally broken and\r\ndifficult terms which the deaf and dumb express by signs, as the\r\nfollowing passage of the Lord’s Prayer:—“Our Father, heaven in, wish your\r\nname respect, wish your soul’s kingdom providence arrive, wish your will\r\ndo heaven earth equality,” &c.—these are like the discourse of the\r\nrefined people of the so-called Celestial Empire.  An attempt was made by\r\nthe Abbé Sicard to teach the deaf and dumb grammatical signs; but they\r\npersisted in restricting themselves to the simple signs of ideas, leaving\r\nthe structure undetermined by any but the natural order of connexion.\r\nSuch is exactly the condition of the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Pacific, we come to the last great family in the languages\r\nof the aboriginal Americans, which have all of them features in common,\r\nproving them to constitute a group by themselves, without any regard to\r\nthe very different degrees of civilization which these nations had\r\nattained at the time of the discovery.  The common resemblance is in the\r\ngrammatical structure as well as in words, and the grammatical structure\r\nof this family is of a very peculiar and complicated kind.  The general\r\ncharacter in this respect has caused the term Polysynthetic to be applied\r\nto the American languages.  A long many-syllabled word is used by the\r\nrude Algonquins and Delawares to express a whole sentence: for example, a\r\nwoman of the latter nation, playing with a little dog or cat, would\r\nperhaps be heard saying, “_kuligatschis_,” meaning, “give me your pretty\r\nlittle paw;” the word, on examination, is found to be made up in this\r\nmanner: _k_, the second personal pronoun; _uli_, part of the word wulet,\r\npretty; _gat_, part of the word wichgat, signifying a leg or paw;\r\n_schis_, conveying the idea of littleness.  In the same tongue, a youth\r\nis called pilape, a word compounded from the first part of pilsit,\r\ninnocent, and the latter part of lenape, a man.  Thus, it will be\r\nobserved, a number of parts of words are taken and thrown together, by a\r\nprocess which has been happily termed _agglutination_, so as to form one\r\nword, conveying a complicated idea.  There is also an elaborate system of\r\ninflection; in nouns, for instance, there is one kind of inflection to\r\nexpress the presence or absence of vitality, and another to express\r\nnumber.  The genius of the language has been described as accumulative:\r\nit “tends rather to add syllables or letters, making farther distinctions\r\nin objects already before the mind, than to introduce new words.” {291}\r\nYet it has also been shewn very distinctly, that these languages are\r\nbased in words of one syllable, like those of the Chinese and Polynesian\r\nfamilies; all the primary ideas are thus expressed: the elaborate system\r\nof inflection and agglutination is shewn to be simply a farther\r\ndevelopment of the language-forming principle, as it may be called—or the\r\nChinese system may be described as an arrestment of this principle at a\r\nparticular early point.  It has been fully shewn, that between the\r\nstructure of the American and other families, sufficient affinities exist\r\nto make a common origin or early connexion extremely likely.  The verbal\r\naffinities are also very considerable.  Humboldt says, “In eighty-three\r\nAmerican languages examined by Messrs. Barton and Vater, one hundred and\r\nseventy words have been found, the roots of which appear to be the same;\r\nand it is easy to perceive that this analogy is not accidental, since it\r\ndoes not rest merely upon imitative harmony, or on that conformity of\r\norgans which produces almost a perfect identity in the first sounds\r\narticulated by children.  Of these one hundred and seventy words which\r\nhave this connexion, three-fifths resemble the Manchou, the Tongouse, the\r\nMongal, and the Samoyed; and two-fifths, the Celtic and Tchoud, the\r\nBiscayan, the Coptic, and Congo languages.  These words have been found\r\nby comparing the whole of the American languages with the whole of those\r\nof the Old World; for hitherto we are acquainted with no American idiom\r\nwhich seems to have an exclusive correspondence with any of the Asiatic,\r\nAfrican, or European tongues.” {293}  Humboldt and others considered\r\nthese words as brought into America by recent immigrants; an idea resting\r\non no proof, and which seems at once refuted by the common words being\r\nchiefly those which represent primary ideas; besides, we now know, what\r\nwas not formerly perceived or admitted, that there are great affinities\r\nof structure also.  I may here refer to a curious mathematical\r\ncalculation by Dr. Thomas Young, to the effect, that if three words\r\ncoincide in two different languages, it is ten to one they must be\r\nderived in both cases from some parent language, or introduced in some\r\nother manner.  “Six words would give more,” he says, “than seventeen\r\nhundred to one, and eight near 100,000, so that in these cases the\r\nevidence would be little short of absolute certainty.”  He instances the\r\nfollowing words to shew a connexion between the ancient Egyptian and the\r\nBiscayan:—\r\n\r\n            BISCAYAN.      EGYPTIAN.\r\n_New_       Beria          Beri.\r\n_A dog_     Ora            Whor.\r\n_Little_    Gutchi         Kudchi.\r\n_Bread_     Ognia          Oik.\r\n_A wolf_    Otgsa          Ounsh.\r\n_Seven_     Shashpi        Shashf.\r\n\r\nNow, as there are, according to Humboldt, one hundred and seventy words\r\nin common between the languages of the new and old continents, and many\r\nof these are expressive of the most primitive ideas, there is, by Dr.\r\nYoung’s calculation, overpowering proof of the original connexion of the\r\nAmerican and other human families.\r\n\r\nThis completes the slight outline which I have been able to give, of the\r\nevidence for the various races of men being descended from one stock.  It\r\ncannot be considered as conclusive, and there are many eminent persons\r\nwho deem the opposite idea the more probable; but I must say that,\r\nwithout the least regard to any other kind of evidence, that which\r\nphysiology and philology present seems to me decidedly favourable to the\r\nidea of a single origin.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the human race is _one_, we are next called upon to inquire\r\nin what part of the earth it may most probably be supposed to have\r\noriginated.  One obvious mode of approximating to a solution of this\r\nquestion is to trace backward the lines in which the principal tribes\r\nappear to have migrated, and to see if these converge nearly to a point.\r\nIt is very remarkable that the lines do converge, and are concentrated\r\nabout the region of Hindostan.  The language, religion, modes of\r\nreckoning time, and some other peculiar ideas of the Americans, are now\r\nbelieved to refer their origin to North-Eastern Asia.  Trace them farther\r\nback in the same direction, and we come to the north of India.  The\r\nhistory of the Celts and Teutones represents them as coming from the\r\neast, the one after the other, successive waves of a tide of population\r\nflowing towards the north-west of Europe: this line being also traced\r\nback, rests finally at the same place.  So does the line of Iranian\r\npopulation, which has peopled the east and south shores of the\r\nMediterranean, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt.  The Malay variety, again, rests\r\nits limit in one direction on the borders of India.  Standing on that\r\npoint, it is easy to see how the human family, originating there, might\r\nspread out in different directions, passing into varieties of aspect and\r\nof language as they spread, the Malay variety proceeding towards the\r\nOceanic region, the Mongolians to the east and north, and sending off the\r\nred men as a sub-variety, the European population going off to the\r\nnorth-westward, and the Syrian, Arabian, and Egyptian, towards the\r\ncountries which they are known to have so long occupied.  The Negro alone\r\nis here unaccounted for; and of that race it may fairly be said, that it\r\nis the one most likely to have had an independent origin, seeing that it\r\nis a type so peculiar in an inveterate black colour, and so mean in\r\ndevelopment.  But it is not necessary to presume such an origin for it,\r\nas much good argument might be employed to shew that it is only a\r\ndeteriorated offshoot of the general stock.  Our view of the probable\r\noriginal seat of man agrees with the ancient traditions of the race.\r\nThere is one among the Hindoos which places the cradle of the human\r\nfamily in Thibet; another makes Ceylon the residence of the first man.\r\nOur view is also in harmony with the hypothesis detailed in the chapter\r\nbefore the last.  According to that theory, we should expect man to have\r\noriginated where the highest species of the quadrumana are to be found.\r\nNow these are unquestionably found in the Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it may be regarded as still an open question, whether mankind\r\nis of one or many origins.  The first human generation may have consisted\r\nof many pairs, though situated at one place, and these may have been\r\nconsiderably different from each other in external characters.  And we\r\nare equally bound to admit, though this does not as yet seem to have\r\noccurred to any other speculator, that there may have been different\r\nlines and sources of origination, geographically apart, but which all\r\nresulted uniformly in the production of a being, one in species, although\r\nvariously marked.\r\n\r\nIt has of late years been a favourite notion with many, that the human\r\nrace was at first in a highly civilized state, and that barbarism was a\r\nsecond condition.  This idea probably took its origin in a wish to\r\nsupport certain interpretations of the Mosaic record, and it has never\r\nyet been propounded by any writer who seemed to have a due sense of the\r\nvalue of science in this class of investigations.  The principal argument\r\nfor it is, that we see many examples of nations falling away from\r\ncivilization into barbarism, while in some regions of the earth, the\r\nhistory of which we do not clearly know, there are remains of works of\r\nart far superior to any which the present unenlightened inhabitants could\r\nhave produced.  It is to be readily admitted that such decadences are\r\ncommon; but do they necessarily prove that there has been anything like a\r\nregular and constant decline into the present state, from a state more\r\ngenerally refined?  May not these be only instances of local failures and\r\nsuppressions of the principle of civilization, where it had begun to take\r\nroot amongst a people generally barbarous?  It is, at least, as\r\nlegitimate to draw this inference from the facts which are known.  But it\r\nis also alleged that we know of no such thing as civilization being ever\r\nself-originated.  It is always seen to be imparted from one people to\r\nanother.  Hence, of course, we must infer that civilization at the first\r\ncould only have been of supernatural origin.  This argument appears to be\r\nfounded on false premises, for civilization does sometimes rise in a\r\nmanner clearly independent amongst a horde of people generally barbarous.\r\nA striking instance is described in the laborious work of Mr. Catlin on\r\nthe North-American tribes.  Far placed among those which inhabit the vast\r\nregion of the north-west, and quite beyond the reach of any influence\r\nfrom the whites, he found a small tribe living in a fortified village,\r\nwhere they cultivated the arts of manufacture, realized comforts and\r\nluxuries, and had attained to a remarkable refinement of manners,\r\ninsomuch as to be generally called the polite and friendly Mandans.  They\r\nwere also more than usually elegant in their persons, and of every\r\nvariety of complexion between that of their compatriots and a pure white.\r\nUp to the time of Mr. Catlin’s visit, these people had been able to\r\ndefend themselves and their possessions against the roving bands which\r\nsurrounded them on all sides; but, soon after, they were attacked by\r\nsmall-pox, which cut them all off except a small party, whom their\r\nenemies rushed in upon and destroyed to a man.  What is this but a\r\nrepetition on a small scale of phenomena with which ancient history\r\nfamiliarizes us—a nation rising in arts and elegances amidst barbarous\r\nneighbours, but at length overpowered by the rude majority, leaving only\r\na Tadmor or a Luxor as a monument of itself to beautify the waste?  What\r\ncan we suppose the nation which built Palenque and Copan to have been but\r\nonly a Mandan tribe, which chanced to have made its way farther along the\r\npath of civilization and the arts, before the barbarians broke in upon\r\nit?  The flame essayed to rise in many parts of the earth; but there were\r\nalways considerable chances against it, and down it accordingly went,\r\ntimes without number; but there was always a vitality in it,\r\nnevertheless, and a tendency to progress, and at length it seems to have\r\nattained a strength against which the powers of barbarism can never more\r\nprevail.  The state of our knowledge of uncivilized nations is very apt\r\nto make us fall into error on this subject.  They are generally supposed\r\nto be all at one point in barbarism, which is far from being the case,\r\nfor in the midst of every great region of uncivilized men, such as North\r\nAmerica, there are nations partially refined.  The Jolofs, Mandingoes,\r\nand Kafirs, are African examples, where a natural and independent origin\r\nfor the improvement which exists is as unavoidably to be presumed as in\r\nthe case of the Mandans.\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive argument against the original civilization of mankind\r\nis to be found in the fact that we do not now see civilization existing\r\nanywhere except in certain conditions altogether different from any we\r\ncan suppose to have existed at the commencement of our race.  To have\r\ncivilization, it is necessary that a people should be numerous and\r\nclosely placed; that they should be fixed in their habitations, and safe\r\nfrom violent external and internal disturbance; that a considerable\r\nnumber of them should be exempt from the necessity of drudging for\r\nimmediate subsistence.  Feeling themselves at ease about the first\r\nnecessities of their nature, including self-preservation, and daily\r\nsubjected to that intellectual excitement which society produces, men\r\nbegin to manifest what is called civilization; but never in rude and\r\nshelterless circumstances, or when widely scattered.  Even men who have\r\nbeen civilized, when transferred to a wide wilderness, where each has to\r\nwork hard and isolatedly for the first requisites of life, soon shew a\r\nretrogression to barbarism: witness the plains of Australia, as well as\r\nthe backwoods of Canada and the prairies of Texas.  Fixity of residence\r\nand thickening of population are perhaps the prime requisites for\r\ncivilization, and hence it will be found that all civilizations as yet\r\nknown have taken place in regions physically limited.  That of Egypt\r\narose in a narrow valley hemmed in by deserts on both sides.  That of\r\nGreece took its rise in a small peninsula bounded on the only land side\r\nby mountains.  Etruria and Rome were naturally limited regions.\r\nCivilizations have taken place at both the eastern and western\r\nextremities of the elder continent—China and Japan, on the one hand;\r\nGermany, Holland, Britain, France, on the other—while the great unmarked\r\ntract between contains nations decidedly less advanced.  Why is this, but\r\nbecause the sea, in both cases, has imposed limits to further migration,\r\nand caused the population to settle and condense—the conditions most\r\nnecessary for social improvement. {302}  Even the simple case of the\r\nMandans affords an illustration of this principle, for Mr. Catlin\r\nexpressly, though without the least regard to theory, attributes their\r\nimprovement to the fact of their being a small tribe, obliged, by fear of\r\ntheir more numerous enemies, to _settle in a permanent village_, so\r\nfortified as to ensure their preservation.  “By this means,” says he,\r\n“they have advanced farther in the arts of manufacture, and have supplied\r\ntheir lodges more abundantly with the comforts and even luxuries of life\r\nthan any Indian nation I know of.  The consequence of this,” he adds, “is\r\nthat the tribe have taken many steps ahead of other tribes in _manners\r\nand refinements_.”  These conditions can only be regarded as natural laws\r\naffecting civilization, and it might not be difficult, taking them into\r\naccount, to predict of any newly settled country its social destiny.  An\r\nisland like Van Dieman’s land might fairly be expected to go on more\r\nrapidly to good manners and sound institutions than a wide region like\r\nAustralia.  The United States might be expected to make no great way in\r\ncivilization till they be fully peopled to the Pacific; and it might not\r\nbe unreasonable to expect that, when that even has occurred, the greatest\r\ncivilizations of that vast territory will be found in the peninsula of\r\nCalifornia and the narrow stripe of country beyond the Rocky Mountains.\r\nThis, however, is a digression.  To return: it is also necessary for a\r\ncivilization that at least a portion of the community should be placed\r\nabove mean and engrossing toils.  Man’s mind becomes subdued, like the\r\ndyer’s hand, to that it works in.  In rude and difficult circumstances we\r\nunavoidably become rude, because then only the inferior and harsher\r\nfaculties of our nature are called into existence.  When, on the\r\ncontrary, there is leisure and abundance, the self-seeking and\r\nself-preserving instincts are allowed to rest, the gentler and more\r\ngenerous sentiments are evoked, and man becomes that courteous and\r\nchivalric being which he is found to be amongst the upper classes of\r\nalmost all civilized countries.  These, then, may be said to be the chief\r\nnatural laws concerned in the moral phenomenon of civilization.  If I am\r\nright in so considering them, it will of course be readily admitted that\r\nthe earliest families of the human race, although they might be simple\r\nand innocent, could not have been in anything like a civilized state,\r\nseeing that the conditions necessary for that state could not have then\r\nexisted.  Let us only for a moment consider some of the things requisite\r\nfor their being civilized,—namely, a set of elegant homes ready furnished\r\nfor their reception, fields ready cultivated to yield them food without\r\nlabour, stores of luxurious appliances of all kinds, a complete social\r\nenginery for the securing of life and property,—and we shall turn from\r\nthe whole conceit as one worthy only of the philosophers of Utopia.\r\n\r\nYet, as has been remarked, the earliest families might be simple and\r\ninnocent, while at the same time unskilled and ignorant, and obliged to\r\nlive merely upon such substances as they could readily procure.  The\r\ntraditions of all nations refer to such a state as that in which mankind\r\nwere at first: perhaps it is not so much a tradition as an idea which the\r\nhuman mind naturally inclines to form respecting the fathers of the race;\r\nbut nothing that we see of mankind absolutely forbids our entertaining\r\nthis idea, while there are some considerations rather favourable to it.\r\nA few families, in a state of nature, living near each other, in a\r\ncountry supplying the means of livelihood abundantly, are generally\r\nsimple and innocent; their instinctive and perceptive faculties are also\r\napt to be very active, although the higher intellect may be dormant.  If\r\nwe therefore presume India to have been the cradle of our race, they\r\nmight at first exemplify a sort of golden age; but it could not be of\r\nlong continuance.  The very first movements from the primal seat would be\r\nattended with degradation, nor could there be any tendency to true\r\ncivilization till groups had settled and thickened in particular seats\r\nphysically limited.\r\n\r\nThe probability may now be assumed that the human race sprung from one\r\nstock, which was at first in a state of simplicity, if not barbarism.  As\r\nyet we have not seen very distinctly how the various branches of the\r\nfamily, as they parted off, and took up separate ground, became marked by\r\nexternal features so peculiar.  Why are the Africans black, and generally\r\nmarked by coarse features and ungainly forms?  Why are the Mongolians\r\ngenerally yellow, the Americans red, the Caucasians white?  Why the flat\r\nfeatures of the Chinese, the small stature of the Laps, the soft round\r\nforms of the English, the lank features of their descendants, the\r\nAmericans?  All of these phenomena appear, in a word, to be explicable on\r\nthe ground of _development_.  We have already seen that various leading\r\nanimal forms represent stages in the embryotic progress of the\r\nhighest—the human being.  Our brain goes through the various stages of a\r\nfish’s, a reptile’s, and a mammifer’s brain, and finally becomes human.\r\nThere is more than this, for, after completing the animal\r\ntransformations, it passes through the characters in which it appears, in\r\nthe Negro, Malay, American, and Mongolian nations, and finally is\r\nCaucasian.  The face partakes of these alterations.  “One of the earliest\r\npoints in which ossification commences is the lower jaw.  This bone is\r\nconsequently sooner completed than the other bones of the head, and\r\nacquires a predominance, which, as is well known, it never loses in the\r\nNegro.  During the soft pliant state of the bones of the skull, the\r\noblong form which they naturally assume, approaches nearly the permanent\r\nshape of the Americans.  At birth, the flattened face, and broad smooth\r\nforehead of the infant, the position of the eyes rather towards the side\r\nof the head, and the widened space between, represent the Mongolian form;\r\nwhile it is only as the child advances to maturity, that the oval face,\r\nthe arched forehead, and the marked features of the true Caucasian,\r\nbecome perfectly developed.” {307a}  _The leading characters_, _in\r\nshort_, _of the various races of mankind_, _are simply representations of\r\nparticular stages in the development of the highest or Caucasian type_.\r\nThe Negro exhibits permanently the imperfect brain, projecting lower jaw,\r\nand slender bent limbs, of a Caucasian child, some considerable time\r\nbefore the period of its birth.  The aboriginal American represents the\r\nsame child nearer birth.  The Mongolian is an arrested infant newly born.\r\nAnd so forth.  All this is as respects form; {307b} but whence colour?\r\nThis might be supposed to have depended on climatal agencies only; but it\r\nhas been shewn by overpowering evidence to be independent of these.  In\r\nfurther considering the matter, we are met by the very remarkable fact\r\nthat colour is deepest in the least perfectly developed type, next in the\r\nMalay, next in the American, next in the Mongolian, the very order in\r\nwhich the degrees of development are ranged.  _May not colour_, _then_,\r\n_depend upon development also_?  We do not, indeed, see that a Caucasian\r\nfœtus at the stage which the African represents is anything like black;\r\nneither is a Caucasian child yellow, like the Mongolian.  There may,\r\nnevertheless, be a character of skin at a certain stage of development\r\nwhich is predisposed to a particular colour when it is presented as the\r\nenvelope of a mature being.  Development being arrested at so immature a\r\nstage in the case of the Negro, the skin may take on the colour as an\r\nunavoidable consequence of its imperfect organization.  It is favourable\r\nto this view, that Negro infants are not deeply black at first, but only\r\nacquire the full colour tint after exposure for some time to the\r\natmosphere.  Another consideration in its favour is that there is a\r\nlikelihood of peculiarities of form and colour, since they are so\r\ncoincident, depending on one set of phenomena.  If it be admitted as\r\ntrue, there can be no difficulty in accounting for all the varieties of\r\nmankind.  They are simply the result of so many advances and\r\nretrogressions in the developing power of the human mothers, these\r\nadvances and retrogressions being, as we have formerly seen, the\r\nimmediate effect of external conditions in nutrition, hardship, &c.,\r\n{309} and also, perhaps, to some extent, of the suitableness and\r\nunsuitableness of marriages, for it is found that parents too nearly\r\nrelated tend to produce offspring of the Mongolian type,—that is, persons\r\nwho in maturity still are a kind of children.  According to this view,\r\nthe greater part of the human race must be considered as having lapsed or\r\ndeclined from the original type.  In the Caucasian or Indo-European\r\nfamily alone has the primitive organization been improved upon.  The\r\nMongolian, Malay, American, and Negro, comprehending perhaps five-sixths\r\nof mankind, are degenerate.  Strange that the great plan should admit of\r\nfailures and aberrations of such portentous magnitude!  But pause and\r\nreflect; take time into consideration: the past history of mankind may\r\nbe, to what is to come, but as a day.  Look at the progress even now\r\nmaking over the barbaric parts of the earth by the best examples of the\r\nCaucasian type, promising not only to fill up the waste places, but to\r\nsupersede the imperfect nations already existing.  Who can tell what\r\nprogress may be made, even in a single century, towards reversing the\r\nproportions of the perfect and imperfect types? and who can tell but that\r\nthe time during which the mean types have lasted, long as it appears, may\r\nyet be thrown entirely into the shade by the time during which the best\r\ntypes will remain predominant?\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the traces of a common origin in all languages afford a\r\nground of presumption for the unity of the human race.  They establish a\r\nstill stronger probability that mankind had not yet begun to disperse\r\nbefore they were possessed of a means of communicating their ideas by\r\nconventional sounds—in short, speech.  This is a gift so peculiar to man,\r\nand in itself so remarkable, that there is a great inclination to surmise\r\na miraculous origin for it, although there is no proper ground, or even\r\nsupport, for such an idea in Scripture, while it is clearly opposed to\r\neverything else that we know with regard to the providential arrangements\r\nfor the creation of our race.  Here, as in many other cases, a little\r\nobservation of nature might have saved much vain discussion.  The real\r\ncharacter of language itself has not been thoroughly understood.\r\nLanguage, in its most comprehensive sense, is the communication of ideas\r\nby whatever means.  Ideas can be communicated by looks, gestures, and\r\nsigns of various other kinds, as well as by speech.  The inferior animals\r\npossess some of those means of communicating ideas, and they have\r\nlikewise a silent and unobservable mode of their own, the nature of which\r\nis a complete mystery to us, though we are assured of its reality by its\r\neffects.  Now, as the inferior animals were all in being before man,\r\nthere was language upon earth long ere the history of our race commenced.\r\nThe only additional fact in the history of language, which was produced\r\nby our creation, was the rise of a new mode of expression—namely, that by\r\n_sound-signs_ produced by the vocal organs.  In other words, speech was\r\nthe only novelty in this respect attending the creation of the human\r\nrace.  No doubt it was an addition of great importance, for, in\r\ncomparison with it, the other natural modes of communicating ideas sink\r\ninto insignificance.  Still, the main and fundamental phenomenon,\r\nlanguage, as the communication of ideas, was no new gift of the Creator\r\nto man; and in speech itself, when we judge of it as a natural fact, we\r\nsee only a result of some of those superior endowments of which so many\r\nothers have fallen to our lot through the medium of an improved or\r\nadvanced organization.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious natural endowment concerned in speech is that\r\npeculiar organization of the larynx, trachea, and mouth, which enables us\r\nto produce the various sounds required in the case.  Man started at first\r\nwith this organization ready for use, a constitution of the atmosphere\r\nadapted for the sounds which that organization was calculated to produce,\r\nand, lastly, but not leastly, as will afterwards be more particularly\r\nshewn, a mental power within, prompting to, and giving directions for,\r\nthe expression of ideas.  Such an arrangement of mutually adapted things\r\nwas as likely to produce sounds as an Eolian harp placed in a draught is\r\nto produce tones.  It was unavoidable that human beings so organized, and\r\nin such a relation to external nature, should utter sounds, and also come\r\nto attach to these conventional meanings, thus forming the elements of\r\nspoken language.  The great difficulty which has been felt was to account\r\nfor man going in this respect beyond the inferior animals.  There could\r\nhave been no such difficulty if speculators in this class of subjects had\r\nlooked into physiology for an account of the superior vocal organization\r\nof man, and had they possessed a true science of mind to shew man\r\npossessing a faculty for the expression of ideas which is only rudimental\r\nin the lower animals.  Another difficulty has been in the consideration\r\nthat, if men were at first utterly untutored and barbarous, they could\r\nscarcely be in a condition to form or employ language—an instrument which\r\nit requires the fullest powers of thought to analyse and speculate upon.\r\nBut this difficulty also vanishes upon reflection—for, in the first\r\nplace, we are not bound to suppose the fathers of our race early\r\nattaining to great proficiency in language, and, in the second, language\r\nitself seems to be amongst the things least difficult to be acquired, if\r\nwe can form any judgment from what we see in children, most of whom have,\r\nby three years of age, while their information and judgment are still as\r\nnothing, mastered and familiarized themselves with a quantity of words,\r\ninfinitely exceeding in proportion what they acquire in the course of any\r\nsubsequent similar portion of time.\r\n\r\nDiscussions as to which parts of speech were first formed, and the\r\nprocesses by which grammatical structure and inflections took their rise,\r\nappear in a great measure needless, after the matter has been placed in\r\nthis light.  The mental powers could readily connect particular arbitrary\r\nsounds with particular ideas, whether those ideas were nouns, verbs, or\r\ninterjections.  As the words of all languages can be traced back into\r\nroots which are monosyllables, we may presume these sounds to have all\r\nbeen monosyllabic accordingly.  The clustering of two or more together to\r\nexpress a compound idea, and the formation of inflections by additional\r\nsyllables expressive of pronouns and such prepositions as of, by, and to,\r\nare processes which would or might occur as matters of course, being\r\nsimple results of a mental power called into action, and partly directed,\r\nby external necessities.  This power, however, as we find it in very\r\ndifferent degrees of endowment in individuals, so would it be in\r\ndifferent degrees of endowment in nations, or branches of the human\r\nfamily.  Hence we find the formation of words and the process of their\r\ncomposition and grammatical arrangement, in very different stages of\r\ndevelopment in different races.  The Chinese have a language composed of\r\na limited number of monosyllables, which they multiply in use by mere\r\nvariations of accent, and which they have never yet attained the power of\r\nclustering or inflecting; the language of this immense nation—the third\r\npart of the human race—may be said to be in the condition of infancy.\r\nThe aboriginal Americans, so inferior in civilization, have, on the other\r\nhand, a language of the most elaborately composite kind, perhaps even\r\nexceeding, in this respect, the languages of the most refined European\r\nnations.  These are but a few out of many facts tending to shew that\r\nlanguage is in a great measure independent of civilization, as far as its\r\nadvance and development are concerned.  Do they not also help to prove\r\nthat cultivated intellect is not necessary for the origination of\r\nlanguage?\r\n\r\nFacts daily presented to our observation afford equally simple reasons\r\nfor the almost infinite diversification of language.  It is invariably\r\nfound that, wherever society is at once dense and refined, language tends\r\nto be uniform throughout the whole population, and to undergo few changes\r\nin the course of time.  Wherever, on the contrary, we have a scattered\r\nand barbarous people, we have great diversities, and comparatively rapid\r\nalterations of language.  Insomuch that, while English, French, and\r\nGerman are each spoken with little variation by many millions, there are\r\nislands in the Indian archipelago, probably not inhabited by one million,\r\nbut in which there are hundreds of languages, as diverse as are English,\r\nFrench, and German.  It is easy to see how this should be.  There are\r\npeculiarities in the vocal organization of every person, tending to\r\nproduce peculiarities of pronunciation; for example, it has been stated\r\nthat each child in a family of six gave the monosyllable, fly, in a\r\ndifferent manner, (eye, fy, ly, &c.) until, when the organs were more\r\nadvanced, correct example induced the proper pronunciation of this and\r\nsimilar words.  Such departures from orthoepy are only to be checked by\r\nthe power of such example; but this is a power not always present, or not\r\nalways of sufficient strength.  The able and self-devoted Robert Moffat,\r\nin his work on South Africa, states, without the least regard to\r\nhypothesis, that amongst the people of the towns of that great region,\r\n“the purity and harmony of language is kept up by their pitchos or public\r\nmeetings, by their festivals and ceremonies, as well as by their songs\r\nand their constant intercourse.  With the isolated villages of the desert\r\nit is far otherwise.  They have no such meetings; they are compelled to\r\ntraverse the wilds, often to a great distance from their native village.\r\nOn such occasions, fathers and mothers, and all who can bear a burden,\r\noften set out for weeks at a time, and leave their children to the care\r\nof two or three infirm old people.  The infant progeny, some of whom are\r\nbeginning to lisp, while others can just master a whole sentence, and\r\nthose still farther advanced, romping and playing together, the children\r\nof nature, through the live-long day, _become habituated to a language of\r\ntheir own_.  The more voluble condescend to the less precocious, and\r\nthus, from this infant Babel, proceeds a dialect composed of a host of\r\nmongrel words and phrases, joined together without rule, and _in the\r\ncourse of a generation the entire character of the language is changed_.”\r\n{317}  I have been told, that in like manner the children of the\r\nManchester factory workers, left for a great part of the day, in large\r\nassemblages, under the care of perhaps a single elderly person, and\r\nspending the time in amusements, are found to make a great deal of new\r\nlanguage.  I have seen children in other circumstances amuse themselves\r\nby concocting and throwing into the family circulation entirely new\r\nwords; and I believe I am running little risk of contradiction when I say\r\nthat there is scarcely a family, even amongst the middle classes of this\r\ncountry, who have not some peculiarities of pronunciation and syntax,\r\nwhich have originated amongst themselves, it is hardly possible to say\r\nhow.  All these things being considered, it is easy to understand how\r\nmankind have come at length to possess between three and four thousand\r\nlanguages, all different at least as much as French, German, and English,\r\nthough, as has been shewn, the traces of a common origin are observable\r\nin them all.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said on the question whether mankind were originally\r\nbarbarous or civilized, will have prepared the reader for understanding\r\nhow the arts and sciences, and the rudiments of civilization itself, took\r\ntheir rise amongst men.  The only source of fallacious views on this\r\nsubject is the so frequent observation of arts, sciences, and social\r\nmodes, forms, and ideas, being not indigenous where we see them now\r\nflourishing, but known to have been derived elsewhere: thus Rome borrowed\r\nfrom Greece, Greece from Egypt, and Egypt itself, lost in the mists of\r\nhistoric antiquity, is now supposed to have obtained the light of\r\nknowledge from some still earlier scene of intellectual culture.  This\r\nhas caused to many a great difficulty in supposing a natural or\r\nspontaneous origin for civilization and the attendant arts.  But, in the\r\nfirst place, several stages of derivation are no conclusive argument\r\nagainst there having been an originality at some earlier stage.  In the\r\nsecond, such observers have not looked far enough, for, if they had, they\r\ncould have seen various instances of civilizations which it is\r\nimpossible, with any plausibility, to trace back to a common origin with\r\nothers; such are those of China and America.  They would also have seen\r\ncivilization springing up, as it were, like oases amongst the arid plains\r\nof barbarism, as in the case of the Mandans.  A still more attentive\r\nstudy of the subject would have shewn, amongst living men, the very\r\npsychological procedure on which the origination of civilization and the\r\narts and sciences depended.\r\n\r\nThese things, like language, are simply the effects of the spontaneous\r\nworking of certain mental faculties, each in relation to the things of\r\nthe external world on which it was intended by creative Providence to be\r\nexercised.  The monkeys themselves, without instruction from any quarter,\r\nlearn to use sticks in fighting, and some build houses—an act which\r\ncannot in their case be considered as one of instinct, but of\r\nintelligence.  Such being the case, there is no necessary difficulty in\r\nsupposing how man, with his superior mental organization, (a brain five\r\ntimes heavier,) was able, in his primitive state, without instruction, to\r\nturn many things in nature to his use, and commence, in short, the circle\r\nof the domestic arts.  He appears, in the most unfavourable\r\ncircumstances, to be able to provide himself with some sort of dwelling,\r\nto make weapons, and to practise some simple kind of cookery.  But,\r\ngranting, it will be said, that he can go thus far, how does he ever\r\nproceed farther unprompted, seeing that many nations remain fixed for\r\never at this point, and seem unable to take one step in advance?  It is\r\nperfectly true that there is such a fixation in many nations; but, on the\r\nother hand, all nations are not alike in mental organization, and another\r\npoint has been established, that only when some favourable circumstances\r\nhave settled a people in one place, do arts and social arrangements get\r\nleave to flourish.  If we were to limit our view to humbly endowed\r\nnations, or the common class of minds in those called civilized, we\r\nshould see absolutely no conceivable power for the origination of new\r\nideas and devices.  But let us look at the inventive class of minds which\r\nstand out amongst their fellows—the men who, with little prompting or\r\nnone, conceive new ideas in science, arts, morals—and we can be at no\r\nloss to understand how and whence have arisen the elements of that\r\ncivilization which history traces from country to country throughout the\r\ncourse of centuries.  See a Pascal, reproducing the Alexandrian’s\r\nproblems at fifteen; a Ferguson, making clocks from the suggestions of\r\nhis own brain, while tending cattle on a Morayshire heath; a boy\r\nLawrence, in an inn on the Bath road, producing, without a master,\r\ndrawings which the educated could not but admire; or look at Solon and\r\nConfucius, devising sage laws, and breathing the accents of all but\r\ndivine wisdom, for their barbarous fellow-countrymen, three thousand\r\nyears ago—and the whole mystery is solved at once.  Amongst the\r\narrangements of Providence is one for the production of original,\r\ninventive, and aspiring minds, which, when circumstances are not\r\ndecidedly unfavourable, strike out new ideas for the benefit of their\r\nfellow-creatures, or put upon them a lasting impress of their own\r\nsuperior sentiments.  Nations, improved by these means, become in turn\r\n_foci_ for the diffusion of light over the adjacent regions of\r\nbarbarism—their very passions helping to this end, for nothing can be\r\nmore clear than that ambitious aggression has led to the civilization of\r\nmany countries.  Such is the process which seems to form the destined\r\nmeans for bringing mankind from the darkness of barbarism to the day of\r\nknowledge and mechanical and social improvement.  Even the noble art of\r\nletters is but, as Dr. Adam Fergusson has remarked, “a natural produce of\r\nthe human mind, which will rise spontaneously, wherever men are happily\r\nplaced;” original alike amongst the ancient Egyptians and the dimly\r\nmonumented Toltecans of Yucatan.  “Banish,” says Dr. Gall, “music,\r\npoetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, all the arts and sciences, and\r\nlet your Homers, Raphaels, Michael Angelos, Glucks, and Canovas, be\r\nforgotten, yet let men of genius of every description spring up, and\r\npoetry, music, painting, architecture, sculpture, and all the arts and\r\nsciences will again shine out in all their glory.  Twice within the\r\nrecords of history has the human race traversed the great circle of its\r\nentire destiny, and twice has the rudeness of barbarism been followed by\r\na higher degree of refinement.  It is a great mistake to suppose one\r\npeople to have proceeded from another on account of their conformity of\r\nmanners, customs, and arts.  The swallow of Paris builds its nest like\r\nthe swallow of Vienna, but does it thence follow that the former sprung\r\nfrom the latter?  With the same causes we have the same effects; with the\r\nsame organization we have the manifestation of the same powers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL CONSTITUTION OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT has been one of the most agreeable tasks of modern science to trace\r\nthe wonderfully exact adaptations of the organization of animals to the\r\nphysical circumstances amidst which they are destined to live.  From the\r\nmandibles of insects to the hand of man, all is seen to be in the most\r\nharmonious relation to the things of the outward world, thus clearly\r\nproving that _design_ presided in the creation of the whole—design again\r\nimplying a designer, another word for a CREATOR.\r\n\r\nIt would be tiresome to present in this place even a selection of the\r\nproofs which have been adduced on this point.  The Natural Theology of\r\nPaley, and the Bridgewater Treatises, place the subject in so clear a\r\nlight, that the general postulate may be taken for granted.  The physical\r\nconstitution of animals is, then, to be regarded as in the nicest\r\ncongruity and adaptation to the external world.\r\n\r\nLess clear ideas have hitherto been entertained on the mental\r\nconstitution of animals.  The very nature of this constitution is not as\r\nyet generally known or held as ascertained.  There is, indeed, a notion\r\nof old standing, that the mind is in some way connected with the brain;\r\nbut the metaphysicians insist that it is, in reality, known only by its\r\nacts or effects, and they accordingly present the subject in a form which\r\nis unlike any other kind of science, for it does not so much as pretend\r\nto have nature for its basis.  There is a general disinclination to\r\nregard mind in connexion with organization, from a fear that this must\r\nneeds interfere with the cherished religious doctrine of the spirit of\r\nman, and lower him to the level of the brutes.  A distinction is\r\ntherefore drawn between our mental manifestations and those of the lower\r\nanimals, the latter being comprehended under the term instinct, while\r\nours are collectively described as mind, mind being again a received\r\nsynonyme with soul, the immortal part of man.  There is here a strange\r\nsystem of confusion and error, which it is most imprudent to regard as\r\nessential to religion, since candid investigations of nature tend to shew\r\nits untenableness.  There is, in reality, nothing to prevent our\r\nregarding man as specially endowed with an immortal spirit, at the same\r\ntime that his ordinary mental manifestations are looked upon as simple\r\nphenomena resulting from organization, those of the lower animals being\r\nphenomena absolutely the same in character, though developed within much\r\nnarrower limits. {326}\r\n\r\nWhat has chiefly tended to take mind, in the eyes of learned and\r\nunlearned, out of the range of nature, is its apparently irregular and\r\nwayward character.  How different the manifestations in different beings!\r\nhow unstable in all!—at one time so calm, at another so wild and\r\nimpulsive!  It seemed impossible that anything so subtle and aberrant\r\ncould be part of a system, the main features of which are regularity and\r\nprecision.  But the irregularity of mental phenomena is only in\r\nappearance.  When we give up the individual, and take the mass, we find\r\nas much uniformity of result as in any other class of natural phenomena.\r\nThe irregularity is exactly of the same kind as that of the weather.  No\r\nman can say what may be the weather of to-morrow; but the quantity of\r\nrain which falls in any particular place in any five years, is precisely\r\nthe same as the quantity which falls in any other five years at the same\r\nplace.  Thus, while it is absolutely impossible to predict of any one\r\nFrenchman that during next year he will commit a crime, it is quite\r\ncertain that about one in every six hundred and fifty of the French\r\npeople will do so, because in past years the proportion has generally\r\nbeen about that amount, the tendencies to crime in relation to the\r\ntemptations being everywhere invariable over a sufficiently wide range of\r\ntime.  So also, the number of persons taken in charge by the police in\r\nLondon for being drunk and disorderly on the streets, is, week by week, a\r\nnearly uniform quantity, shewing that the inclination to drink to excess\r\nis always in the mass about the same, regard being had to the existing\r\ntemptations or stimulations to this vice.  Even mistakes and oversights\r\nare of regular recurrence, for it is found in the post-offices of large\r\ncities, that the number of letters put in without addresses is year by\r\nyear the same.  Statistics has made out an equally distinct regularity in\r\na wide range, with regard to many other things concerning the mind, and\r\nthe doctrine founded upon it has lately produced a scheme which may well\r\nstrike the ignorant with surprise.  It was proposed to establish in\r\nLondon a society for ensuring the integrity of clerks, secretaries,\r\ncollectors, and all such functionaries as are usually obliged to find\r\nsecurity for money passing through their hands in the course of business.\r\nA gentleman of the highest character as an actuary spoke of the plan in\r\nthe following terms:—“If a thousand bankers’ clerks were to club together\r\nto indemnify their securities, by the payment of one pound a year each,\r\nand if each had given security for 500_l._, it is obvious that two in\r\neach year might become defaulters to that amount, four to half the\r\namount, and so on, without rendering the guarantee fund insolvent.  If it\r\nbe tolerably well ascertained that the instances of dishonesty (yearly)\r\namong such persons amount to one in five hundred, this club would\r\ncontinue to exist, subject to being in debt in a bad year, to an amount\r\nwhich it would be able to discharge in good ones.  The only question\r\nnecessary to be asked previous to the formation of such a club would\r\nbe,—may it not be feared that the motive to resist dishonesty would be\r\nlessened by the existence of the club, or that ready-made rogues, by\r\nbelonging to it, might find the means of obtaining situations which they\r\nwould otherwise have been kept out of by the impossibility of obtaining\r\nsecurity among those who know them?  Suppose this be sufficiently\r\nanswered by saying, that none but those who could bring satisfactory\r\ntestimony to their previous good character should be allowed to join the\r\nclub; that persons who may now hope that a deficiency on their parts will\r\nbe made up and hushed up by the relative or friend who is security, will\r\nknow very well that the club will have no motive to decline a\r\nprosecution, or to keep the secret, and so on.  It then only remains to\r\nask, whether the sum demanded for the guarantee is sufficient?” {331}\r\nThe philosophical principle on which the scheme proceeds, seems to be\r\nsimply this, that, amongst a given (large) number of persons of good\r\ncharacter, there will be, within a year or other considerable space of\r\ntime, a determinate number of instances in which moral principle and the\r\nterror of the consequences of guilt will be overcome by temptations of a\r\ndeterminate kind and amount, and thus occasion a certain periodical\r\namount of loss which the association must make up.\r\n\r\nThis statistical regularity in moral affairs fully establishes their\r\nbeing under the presidency of law.  Man is now seen to be an enigma only\r\nas an individual; in the mass he is a mathematical problem.  It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say, much less to argue, that mental action, being proved to\r\nbe under law, passes at once into the category of natural things.  Its\r\nold metaphysical character vanishes in a moment, and the distinction\r\nusually taken between physical and moral is annulled, as only an error in\r\nterms.  This view agrees with what all observation teaches, that mental\r\nphenomena flow directly from the brain.  They are seen to be dependent on\r\nnaturally constituted and naturally conditioned organs, and thus\r\nobedient, like all other organic phenomena, to law.  And how wondrous\r\nmust the constitution of this apparatus be, which gives us consciousness\r\nof thought and of affection, which makes us familiar with the numberless\r\nthings of earth, and enables us to rise in conception and communion to\r\nthe councils of God himself!  It is matter which forms the medium or\r\ninstrument—a little mass which, decomposed, is but so much common dust;\r\nyet in its living constitution, designed, formed, and sustained by\r\nAlmighty Wisdom, how admirable its character! how reflective of the\r\nunutterable depths of that Power by which it was so formed, and is so\r\nsustained!\r\n\r\nIn the mundane economy, mental action takes its place as a means of\r\nproviding for the independent existence and the various relations of\r\nanimals, each species being furnished according to its special\r\nnecessities and the demands of its various relations.  The nervous\r\nsystem—the more comprehensive term for its organic apparatus—is variously\r\ndeveloped in different classes and species, and also in different\r\nindividuals, the volume or mass bearing a general relation to the amount\r\nof power.  In the mollusca and crustacea we see simply a ganglionic cord\r\npervading the extent of the body, and sending out lateral filaments.  In\r\nthe vertebrata, we find a brain with a spinal cord, and branching lines\r\nof nervous tissue. {333}  But here, as in the general structure of\r\nanimals, the great principle of unity is observed.  The brain of the\r\nvertebrata is merely an expansion of one of the ganglions of the nervous\r\ncord of the mollusca and crustacea.  Or the corresponding ganglion of the\r\nmollusca and crustacea may be regarded as the rudiment of a brain; the\r\nsuperior organ thus appearing as only a farther development of the\r\ninferior.  There are many facts which tend to prove that the action of\r\nthis apparatus is of an electric nature, a modification of that\r\nsurprising agent, which takes magnetism, heat, and light, as other\r\nsubordinate forms, and of whose general scope in this great system of\r\nthings we are only beginning to have a right conception.  It has been\r\nfound that simple electricity, artificially produced, and sent along the\r\nnerves of a dead body, excites muscular action.  The brain of a\r\nnewly-killed animal being taken out, and replaced by a substance which\r\nproduces electric action, the operation of digestion, which had been\r\ninterrupted by the death of the animal, was resumed, shewing the absolute\r\nidentity of the brain with a galvanic battery.  Nor is this a very\r\nstartling idea, when we reflect that electricity is almost as\r\nmetaphysical as ever mind was supposed to be.  It is a thing perfectly\r\nintangible, weightless.  Metal may be magnetized, or heated to seven\r\nhundred of Fahrenheit, without becoming the hundredth part of a grain\r\nheavier.  And yet electricity is a real thing, an actual existence in\r\nnature, as witness the effects of heat and light in vegetation—the power\r\nof the galvanic current to re-assemble the particles of copper from a\r\nsolution, and make them again into a solid plate—the rending force of the\r\nthunderbolt as it strikes the oak; see also how both heat and light\r\nobserve the angle of incidence in reflection, as exactly as does the\r\ngrossest stone thrown obliquely against a wall.  So mental action may be\r\nimponderable, intangible, and yet a real existence, and ruled by the\r\nEternal through his laws. {335}\r\n\r\nCommon observation shews a great general superiority of the human mind\r\nover that of the inferior animals.  Man’s mind is almost infinite in\r\ndevice; it ranges over all the world; it forms the most wonderful\r\ncombinations; it seeks back into the past, and stretches forward into the\r\nfuture; while the animals generally appear to have a narrow range of\r\nthought and action.  But so also has an infant but a limited range, and\r\nyet it is mind which works there, as well as in the most accomplished\r\nadults.  The difference between mind in the lower animals and in man is a\r\ndifference in degree only; it is not a specific difference.  All who have\r\nstudied animals by actual observation, and even those who have given a\r\ncandid attention to the subject in books, must attain more or less clear\r\nconvictions of this truth, notwithstanding all the obscurity which\r\nprejudice may have engendered.  We see animals capable of affection,\r\njealousy, envy; we see them quarrel, and conduct quarrels, in the very\r\nmanner pursued by the more impulsive of our own race.  We see them liable\r\nto flattery, inflated with pride, and dejected by shame.  We see them as\r\ntender to their young as human parents are, and as faithful to a trust as\r\nthe most conscientious of human servants.  The horse is startled by\r\nmarvellous objects, as a man is.  The dog and many others shew tenacious\r\nmemory.  The dog also proves himself possessed of imagination, by the act\r\nof dreaming.  Horses, finding themselves in want of a shoe, have of their\r\nown accord gone to a farrier’s shop where they were shod before.  Cats,\r\nclosed up in rooms, will endeavour to obtain their liberation by pulling\r\na latch or ringing a bell.  It has several times been observed that in a\r\nfield of cattle, when one or two were mischievous, and persisted long in\r\nannoying or tyrannizing over the rest, the herd, to all appearance,\r\nconsulted, and then, making a united effort, drove the troublers off the\r\nground.  The members of a rookery have also been observed to take turns\r\nin supplying the needs of a family reduced to orphanhood.  All of these\r\nare acts of reason, in no respect different from similar acts of men.\r\nMoreover, although there is no heritage of accumulated knowledge amongst\r\nthe lower animals, as there is amongst us, they are in some degree\r\nsusceptible of those modifications of natural character, and capable of\r\nthose accomplishments, which we call education.  The taming and\r\ndomestication of animals, and the changes thus produced upon their nature\r\nin the course of generations, are results identical with civilization\r\namongst ourselves; and the quiet, servile steer is probably as unlike the\r\noriginal wild cattle of this country, as the English gentleman of the\r\npresent day is unlike the rude baron of the age of King John.  Between a\r\nyoung, unbroken horse, and a trained one, there is, again, all the\r\ndifference which exists between a wild youth reared at his own discretion\r\nin the country, and the same person when he has been toned down by long\r\nexposure to the influences of refined society.  On the accomplishments\r\nacquired by animals it were superfluous to enter at any length; but I may\r\nadvert to the dogs of M. Leonard, as remarkable examples of what the\r\nanimal intellect may be trained to.  When four pieces of card are laid\r\ndown before them, each having a number pronounced _once_ in connexion\r\nwith it, they will, after a re-arrangement of the pieces, select any one\r\nnamed by its number.  They also play at dominoes, and with so much skill\r\nas to triumph over biped opponents, whining if the adversary place a\r\nwrong piece, or if they themselves be deficient in a right one.  Of\r\nextensive combinations of thought we have no reason to believe that any\r\nanimal is capable—and yet most of us must feel the force of Walter\r\nScott’s remark, that there was scarcely anything which he would not\r\nbelieve of a dog.  There is a curious result of education in certain\r\nanimals, namely, that habits to which they have been trained in some\r\ninstances become hereditary.  For example, the accomplishment of pointing\r\nat game, although a pure result of education, appears in the young pups\r\nbrought up apart from their parents and kind.  The peculiar leap of the\r\nIrish horse, acquired in the course of traversing a boggy country, is\r\ncontinued in the progeny brought up in England.  This hereditariness of\r\nspecific habits suggests a relation to that form of psychological\r\ndemonstration usually called instinct; but instinct is only another term\r\nfor mind, or is mind in a peculiar stage of development; and though the\r\nfact were otherwise, it could not affect the postulate, that\r\ndemonstrations such as have been enumerated are mainly intellectual\r\ndemonstrations, not to be distinguished as such from those of human\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nMore than this, the lower animals manifested mental phenomena long before\r\nman existed.  While as yet there was no brain capable of working out a\r\nmathematical problem, the economy of the six-sided figure was exemplified\r\nby the instinct of the bee.  Ere human musician had whistled or piped,\r\nthe owl hooted in B flat, the cuckoo had her song of a falling third, and\r\nthe chirp of the cricket was in B.  The dog and the elephant prefigured\r\nthe sagacity of the human mind.  The love of a human mother for her babe\r\nwas anticipated by nearly every humbler mammal, the carnaria not\r\nexcepted.  The peacock strutted, the turkey blustered, and the cock\r\nfought for victory, just as human beings afterwards did, and still do.\r\nOur faculty of imitation, on which so much of our amusement depends, was\r\nexercised by the mocking-bird; and the whole tribe of monkeys must have\r\nwalked about the pre-human world, playing off those tricks in which we\r\nsee the comicality and mischief-making of our character so curiously\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe unity and simplicity which characterize nature give great antecedent\r\nprobability to what observation seems about to establish, that, as the\r\nbrain of the vertebrata generally is just an advanced condition of a\r\nparticular ganglion in the mollusca and crustacea, so are the brains of\r\nthe higher and more intelligent mammalia only farther developments of the\r\nbrains of the inferior orders of the same class.  Or, to the same\r\npurpose, it may be said, that each species has certain superior\r\ndevelopments, according to its needs, while others are in a rudimental or\r\nrepressed state.  This will more clearly appear after some inquiry has\r\nbeen made into the various powers comprehended under the term mind.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and simplest functions of mind is to give\r\nconsciousness—consciousness of our identity and of our existence.  This,\r\napparently, is independent of the _senses_, which are simply media, and,\r\nas Locke has shewn, the only media, through which ideas respecting the\r\nexternal world reach the brain.  The access of such ideas to the brain is\r\nthe act to which the metaphysicians have given the name of perception.\r\nGall, however, has shewn, by induction from a vast number of actual\r\ncases, that there is a part of the brain devoted to perception, and that\r\neven this is subdivided into portions which are respectively dedicated to\r\nthe reception of different sets of ideas, as those of form, size, colour,\r\nweight, objects in their totality, events in their progress or\r\noccurrence, time, musical sounds, &c.  The system of mind invented by\r\nthis philosopher—the only one founded upon nature, or which even pretends\r\nto or admits of that necessary basis—shews a portion of the brain acting\r\nas a faculty of comic ideas, another of imitation, another of wonder, one\r\nfor discriminating or observing differences, and another in which resides\r\nthe power of tracing effects to causes.  There are also parts of the\r\nbrain for the sentimental part of our nature, or the affections, at the\r\nhead of which stand the moral feelings of benevolence, conscientiousness,\r\nand veneration.  Through these, man stands in relation to himself, his\r\nfellow-men, the external world, and his God; and through these comes most\r\nof the happiness of man’s life, as well as that which he derives from the\r\ncontemplation of the world to come, and the cultivation of his relation\r\nto it, (pure religion.)  The other sentiments may be briefly enumerated,\r\ntheir names being sufficient in general to denote their\r\nfunctions—firmness, hope, cautiousness, self-esteem, love of approbation,\r\nsecretiveness, marvellousness, constructiveness, imitation,\r\ncombativeness, destructiveness, concentrativeness, adhesiveness, love of\r\nthe opposite sex, love of offspring, alimentiveness, and love of life.\r\nThrough these faculties, man is connected with the external world, and\r\nsupplied with active impulses to maintain his place in it as an\r\nindividual and as a species.  There is also a faculty, (language) for\r\nexpressing, by whatever means, (signs, gestures, looks, conventional\r\nterms in speech,) the ideas which arise in the mind.  There is a\r\nparticular state of each of these faculties, when the ideas of objects\r\nonce formed by it are revived or reproduced, a process which seems to be\r\nintimately allied with some of the phenomena of the new science of\r\nphotography, when images impressed by reflection of the sun’s rays upon\r\nsensitive paper are, after a temporary obliteration, resuscitated on the\r\nsheet being exposed to the fumes of mercury.  Such are the phenomena of\r\nmemory, that handmaid of intellect, without which there could be no\r\naccumulation of mental capital, but an universal and continual infancy.\r\nConception and imagination appear to be only intensities, so to speak, of\r\nthe state of brain in which memory is produced.  On their promptness and\r\npower depend most of the exertions which distinguish the man of arts and\r\nletters, and even in no small measure the cultivator of science.\r\n\r\nThe faculties above described—the actual elements of the mental\r\nconstitution—are seen in mature man in an indefinite potentiality and\r\nrange of action.  It is different with the lower animals.  They are there\r\ncomparatively definite in their power and restricted in their\r\napplication.  The reader is familiar with what are called instincts in\r\nsome of the humbler species, that is, an uniform and unprompted tendency\r\ntowards certain particular acts, as the building of cells by the bee, the\r\nstoring of provisions by that insect and several others, and the\r\nconstruction of nests for a coming progeny by birds.  This quality is\r\nnothing more than a mode of operation peculiar to the faculties in a\r\nhumble state of endowment, or early stage of development.  The cell\r\nformation of the bee, the house-building of ants and beavers, the\r\nweb-spinning of spiders, are but primitive exercises of constructiveness,\r\nthe faculty which, indefinite with us, leads to the arts of the weaver,\r\nupholsterer, architect, and mechanist, and makes us often work\r\ndelightedly where our labours are in vain, or nearly so.  The storing of\r\nprovisions by the ants is an exercise of acquisitiveness,—the faculty\r\nwhich with us makes rich men and misers.  A vast number of curious\r\ndevices, by which insects provide for the protection and subsistence of\r\ntheir young, whom they are perhaps never to see, are most probably a\r\npeculiar restricted effort of philoprogenitiveness.  The common source of\r\nthis class of acts, and of common mental operations, is shewn very\r\nconvincingly by the melting of the one set into the other.  Thus, for\r\nexample, the bee and bird will make modifications in the ordinary form of\r\ntheir cells and nests when necessity compels them.  Thus, the\r\nalimentiveness of such animals as the dog, usually definite with regard\r\nto quantity and quality, can be pampered or educated up to a kind of\r\nepicurism, that is, an indefiniteness of object and action.  The same\r\nfaculty acts limitedly in ourselves at first, dictating the special act\r\nof sucking; afterwards it acquires indefiniteness.  Such is the real\r\nnature of the distinction between what are called instincts and reason,\r\nupon which so many volumes have been written without profit to the world.\r\nAll faculties are instinctive, that is, dependent on internal and\r\ninherent impulses.  This term is therefore not specially applicable to\r\neither of the recognised modes of the operation of the faculties.  We\r\nonly, in the one case, see the faculty in an immature and slightly\r\ndeveloped state; in the other, in its most advanced condition.  In the\r\none case it is _definite_, in the other _indefinite_, in its range of\r\naction.  These terms would perhaps be the most suitable for expressing\r\nthe distinction.\r\n\r\nIn the humblest forms of being we can trace scarcely anything besides a\r\ndefinite action in a few of the faculties.  Generally speaking, as we\r\nascend in the scale, we see more and more of the faculties in exercise,\r\nand these tending more to the indefinite mode of manifestation.  And for\r\nthis there is the obvious reason in providence, that the lowest animals\r\nhave all of them a very limited sphere of existence, born only to perform\r\na few functions, and enjoy a brief term of life, and then give way to\r\nanother generation, so that they do not need much mental guidance.  At\r\nhigher points in the scale, the sphere of existence is considerably\r\nextended, and the mental operations are less definite accordingly.  The\r\nhorse, dog, and a few other rasorial types, noted for their\r\nserviceableness to our race, have the indefinite powers in no small\r\nendowment.  Man, again, shews very little of the definite mode of\r\noperation, and that little chiefly in childhood, or in barbarism or\r\nidiocy.  Destined for a wide field of action, and to be applicable to\r\ninfinitely varied contingencies, he has all the faculties developed to a\r\nhigh pitch of indefiniteness, that he may be ready to act well in all\r\nimaginable cases.  His commission, it may be said, gives large\r\ndiscretionary powers, while that of the inferior animals is limited to a\r\nfew precise directions.  But when the human brain is congenitally\r\nimperfect or diseased, or when it is in the state of infancy, we see in\r\nit an approach towards the character of the brains of some of the\r\ninferior animals.  Dr. G. J. Davey states that he has frequently\r\nwitnessed, among his patients at the Hanwell Lunatic Asylum, indications\r\nof a particular abnormal cerebration which forcibly reminded him of the\r\nspecific healthy characteristics of animals lower in the scale of\r\norganization; {346} and every one must have observed how often the\r\nactions of children, especially in their moments of play, and where their\r\nselfish feelings are concerned, bear a resemblance to those of certain\r\nfamiliar animals. {347}  Behold, then, the wonderful unity of the whole\r\nsystem.  The grades of mind, like the forms of being, are mere stages of\r\ndevelopment.  In the humbler forms, but a few of the mental faculties are\r\ntraceable, just as we see in them but a few of the lineaments of\r\nuniversal structure.  In man the system has arrived at its highest\r\ncondition.  The few gleams of reason, then, which we see in the lower\r\nanimals, are precisely analogous to such a development of the fore-arm as\r\nwe find in the paddle of the whale.  Causality, comparison, and other of\r\nthe nobler faculties, are in them _rudimental_.\r\n\r\nBound up as we thus are by an identity in the character of our mental\r\norganization with the lower animals, we are yet, it will be observed,\r\nstrikingly distinguished from them by this great advance in development.\r\nWe have faculties in full force and activity which the animals either\r\npossess not at all, or in so low and obscure a form as to be equivalent\r\nto non-existence.  Now these parts of mind are those which connect us\r\nwith the things that are not of this world.  We have veneration,\r\nprompting us to the worship of the Deity, which the animals lack.  We\r\nhave hope, to carry us on in thought beyond the bounds of time.  We have\r\nreason, to enable us to inquire into the character of the Great Father,\r\nand the relation of us, his humble creatures, towards him.  We have\r\nconscientiousness and benevolence, by which we can in a faint and humble\r\nmeasure imitate, in our conduct, that which he exemplifies in the whole\r\nof his wondrous doings.  Beyond this, mental science does not carry us in\r\nsupport of religion: the rest depends on evidence of a different kind.\r\nBut it is surely much that we thus discover in nature a provision for\r\nthings so important.  The existence of faculties having a regard to such\r\nthings is a good evidence that such things exist.  The face of God is\r\nreflected in the organization of man, as a little pool reflects the\r\nglorious sun.\r\n\r\nThe affective or sentimental faculties are all of them liable to operate\r\nwhenever appropriate objects or stimuli are presented, and this they do\r\nas irresistibly and unerringly as the tree sucks up moisture which it\r\nrequires, with only this exception, that one faculty often interferes\r\nwith the action of another, and operates instead by force of superior\r\ninherent strength or temporary activity.  For example, alimentiveness may\r\nbe in powerful operation with regard to its appropriate object, producing\r\na keen appetite, and yet it may not act, in consequence of the more\r\npowerful operation of cautiousness, warning against evil consequences\r\nlikely to ensue from the desired indulgence.  This liability to flit from\r\nunder the control of one feeling to the control of another, constitutes\r\nwhat is recognised as free will in man, being nothing more than a\r\nvicissitude in the supremacy of the faculties over each other.\r\n\r\nIt is a common mistake to suppose that the individuals of our own species\r\nare all of them formed with similar faculties—similar in power and\r\ntendency—and that education and the influence of circumstances produce\r\nall the differences which we observe.  There is not, in the old systems\r\nof mental philosophy, any doctrine more opposite to the truth than this.\r\nIt is refuted at once by the great differences of intellectual tendency\r\nand moral disposition to be observed amongst a group of young children\r\nwho have been all brought up in circumstances perfectly identical—even in\r\ntwins, who have never been but in one place, under the charge of one\r\nnurse, attended to alike in all respects.  The mental characters of\r\nindividuals are inherently various, as the forms of their persons and the\r\nfeatures of their faces are; and education and circumstances, though\r\ntheir influence is not to be despised, are incapable of entirely altering\r\nthese characters, where they are strongly developed.  That the original\r\ncharacters of mind are dependent on the volume of particular parts of the\r\nbrain and the general quality of that viscus, is proved by induction from\r\nan extensive range of observations, the force of which must have been\r\nlong since universally acknowledged but for the unpreparedness of mankind\r\nto admit a functional connexion between mind and body.  The different\r\nmental characters of individuals may be presumed from analogy to depend\r\non the same law of development which we have seen determining forms of\r\nbeing and the mental characters of particular species.  This we may\r\nconceive as carrying forward the intellectual powers and moral\r\ndispositions of some to a high pitch, repressing those of others at a\r\nmoderate amount, and thus producing all the varieties which we see in our\r\nfellow-creatures.  Thus a Cuvier and a Newton are but expansions of a\r\nclown, and the person emphatically called the wicked man, is one whose\r\nhighest moral feelings are rudimental.  Such differences are not confined\r\nto our species; they are only less strongly marked in many of the\r\ninferior animals.  There are clever dogs and wicked horses, as well as\r\nclever men and wicked men, and education sharpens the talents, and in\r\nsome degree regulates the dispositions of animals, as it does our own.\r\nHere I may advert to a very interesting analogy between the mental\r\ncharacters of the types in the quinary system of zoology and the\r\ncharacters of individual men.  We have seen that the pre-eminent type is\r\nusually endowed with an harmonious assemblage of the mental qualities\r\nbelonging to the whole group, while the sub-typical inclines to ferocity,\r\nthe rasorial to gentleness, and so on.  Now, amongst individuals, some\r\nappear to be almost exclusively of the sub-typical, and others of the\r\nrasorial characters, while to a limited number is given the finely\r\nassorted assemblage of qualities which places them on a parallel with the\r\ntypical.  To this may be attributed the universality which marks all the\r\nvery highest brains, such as those of Shakespeare and Scott, men of whom\r\nit has been remarked that they must have possessed within themselves not\r\nonly the poet, but the warrior, the statesman, and the philosopher; and\r\nwho, moreover, appear to have had the mild and manly, the moral and the\r\nforcible parts of our nature, in the most perfect balance.\r\n\r\nThere is, nevertheless, a general adaptation of the mental constitution\r\nof man to the circumstances in which he lives, as there is between all\r\nthe parts of nature to each other.  The goods of the physical world are\r\nonly to be realized by ingenuity and industrious exertion; behold,\r\naccordingly, an intellect full of device, and a fabric of the faculties\r\nwhich would go to pieces or destroy itself if it were not kept in\r\nconstant occupation.  Nature presents to us much that is sublime and\r\nbeautiful: behold faculties which delight in contemplating these\r\nproperties of hers, and in rising upon them, as upon wings, to the\r\npresence of the Eternal.  It is also a world of difficulties and perils,\r\nand see how a large portion of our species are endowed with vigorous\r\npowers which take a pleasure in meeting and overcoming difficulty and\r\ndanger.  Even that principle on which our faculties are constituted—a\r\nwide range of freedom in which to act for all various\r\noccasions—necessitates a resentful faculty, by which individuals may\r\nprotect themselves from the undue and capricious exercise of each other’s\r\nfaculties, and thus preserve their individual rights.  So also there is\r\ncautiousness, to give us a tendency to provide against the evils by which\r\nwe may be assailed; and secretiveness, to enable us to conceal whatever,\r\nbeing divulged, would be offensive to others or injurious to ourselves,—a\r\nfunction which obviously has a certain legitimate range of action,\r\nhowever liable to be abused.  The constitution of the mind generally\r\npoints to a state of intimate relation of individuals towards society,\r\ntowards the external world, and towards things above this world.  No\r\nindividual being is integral or independent; he is only part of an\r\nextensive piece of social mechanism.  The inferior mind, full of rude\r\nenergy and unregulated impulse, does not more require a superior nature\r\nto act as its master and its mentor, than does the superior nature\r\nrequire to be surrounded by such rough elements on which to exercise its\r\nhigh endowments as a ruling and tutelary power.  This relation of each to\r\neach produces a vast portion of the active business of life.  It is easy\r\nto see that, if we were all alike in our moral tendencies, and all placed\r\non a medium of perfect moderation in this respect, the world would be a\r\nscene of everlasting dulness and apathy.  It requires the variety of\r\nindividual constitution to give moral life to the scene.\r\n\r\nThe indefiniteness of the potentiality of the human faculties, and the\r\ncomplexity which thus attends their relations, lead unavoidably to\r\noccasional error.  If we consider for a moment that there are not less\r\nthan thirty such faculties, that they are each given in different\r\nproportions to different persons, that each is at the same time endowed\r\nwith a wide discretion as to the force and frequency of its action, and\r\nthat our neighbours, the world, and our connexions with something beyond\r\nit, are all exercising an ever-varying influence over us, we cannot be\r\nsurprised at the irregularities attending human conduct.  It is simply\r\nthe penalty paid for the superior endowment.  It is here that the\r\nimperfection of our nature resides.  Causality and conscientiousness are,\r\nit is true, guides over all; but even these are only faculties of the\r\nsame indeterminate constitution as the rest, and partake accordingly of\r\nthe same inequality of action.  Man is therefore a piece of mechanism,\r\nwhich never can act so as to satisfy his own ideas of what he might\r\nbe—for he can imagine a state of moral perfection, (as he can imagine a\r\nglobe formed of diamonds, pearls, and rubies,) though his constitution\r\nforbids him to realize it.  There ever will, in the best disposed and\r\nmost disciplined minds, be occasional discrepancies between the amount of\r\ntemptation and the power summoned for regulation or resistance, or\r\nbetween the stimulus and the mobility of the faculty; and hence those\r\nerrors, and shortcomings, and excesses, without end, with which the good\r\nare constantly finding cause to charge themselves.  There is at the same\r\ntime even here a possibility of improvement.  In infancy, the impulses\r\nare all of them irregular; a child is cruel, cunning, and false, under\r\nthe slightest temptation, but in time learns to control these\r\ninclinations, and to be habitually humane, frank, and truthful.  So is\r\nhuman society, in its earliest stages, sanguinary, aggressive, and\r\ndeceitful, but in time becomes just, faithful, and benevolent.  To such\r\nimprovements there is a natural tendency which will operate in all fair\r\ncircumstances, though it is not to be expected that irregular and undue\r\nimpulses will ever be altogether banished from the system.\r\n\r\nIt may still be a puzzle to many, how beings should be born into the\r\nworld whose organization is such that they unavoidably, even in a\r\ncivilized country, become malefactors.  Does God, it may be asked, make\r\ncriminals?  Does he fashion certain beings with a predestination to evil?\r\nHe does not do so; and yet the criminal type of brain, as it is called,\r\ncomes into existence in accordance with laws which the Deity has\r\nestablished.  It is not, however, as the result of the first or general\r\nintention of those laws, but as an exception from their ordinary and\r\nproper action.  The production of those evilly disposed beings is in this\r\nmanner.  The moral character of the progeny depends in a general way, (as\r\ndoes the physical character also,) upon conditions of the parents,—both\r\ngeneral conditions, and conditions at the particular time of the\r\ncommencement of the existence of the new being, and likewise external\r\nconditions affecting the fœtus through the mother.  Now the amount of\r\nthese conditions is indefinite.  The faculties of the parents, as far as\r\nthese are concerned, may have oscillated for the time towards the extreme\r\nof tensibility in one direction.  The influences upon the fœtus may have\r\nalso been of an extreme and unusual kind.  Let us suppose that the\r\nconditions upon the whole have been favourable for the development, not\r\nof the higher, but of the lower sentiments, and of the propensities of\r\nthe new being, the result will necessarily be a mean type of brain.\r\nHere, it will be observed, God no more decreed an immoral being, than he\r\ndecreed an immoral paroxysm of the sentiments.  Our perplexity is in\r\nconsidering the ill-disposed being by himself.  He is only a part of a\r\nseries of phenomena, traceable to a principle good in the main, but which\r\nadmits of evil as an exception.  We have seen that it is for wise ends\r\nthat God leaves our moral faculties to an indefinite range of action; the\r\ngeneral good results of this arrangement are obvious; but exceptions of\r\nevil are inseparable from such a system, and this is one of them.  To\r\ncome to particular illustration—when a people are oppressed, or kept in a\r\nstate of slavery, they invariably contract habits of lying, for the\r\npurpose of deceiving and outwitting their superiors, falsehood being a\r\nrefuge of the weak under difficulties.  What is a habit in parents\r\nbecomes an inherent quality in children.  We are not, therefore, to be\r\nsurprised when a traveller tells us that black children in the West\r\nIndies appear to lie by instinct, and never answer a white person truly\r\neven in the simplest matter.  Here we have secretiveness roused in a\r\npeople to a state of constant and exalted exercise; an over tendency of\r\nthe nervous energy in that direction is the consequence, and a new\r\norganic condition is established.  This tells upon the progeny, which\r\ncomes into the world with secretiveness excessive in volume and activity.\r\nAll other evil characteristics may be readily conceived as being\r\nimplanted in a new generation in the same way.  And sometimes not one,\r\nbut several generations, may be concerned in bringing up the result to a\r\npitch which produces crime.  It is, however, to be observed, that the\r\ngeneral tendency of things is to a limitation, not the extension of such\r\nabnormally constituted beings.  The criminal brain finds itself in a\r\nsocial scene where all is against it.  It may struggle on for a time, but\r\nthe medium and superior natures are never long at a loss in getting the\r\nbetter of it.  The disposal of such beings will always depend much on the\r\nmoral state of a community, the degree in which just views prevail with\r\nregard to human nature, and the feelings which accident may have caused\r\nto predominate at a particular time.  Where the mass was little\r\nenlightened or refined, and terrors for life or property were highly\r\nexcited, malefactors have ever been treated severely.  But when order is\r\ngenerally triumphant, and reason allowed sway, men begin to see the true\r\ncase of criminals—namely, that while one large department are victims of\r\nerroneous social conditions, another are brought to error by tendencies\r\nwhich they are only unfortunate in having inherited from nature.\r\nCriminal jurisprudence then addresses itself less to the direct\r\npunishment than to the reformation and care-taking of those liable to its\r\nattention.  And such a treatment of criminals, it may be farther\r\nremarked, so that it stop short of affording any encouragement to crime,\r\n(a point which experience will determine,) is evidently no more than\r\njustice, seeing how accidentally all forms of the moral constitution are\r\ndistributed, and how thoroughly mutual obligation shines throughout the\r\nwhole frame of society—the strong to help the weak, the good to redeem\r\nand restrain the bad.\r\n\r\nThe sum of all we have seen of the psychical constitution of man is, that\r\nits Almighty Author has destined it, like everything else, to be\r\ndeveloped from inherent qualities, and to have a mode of action depending\r\nsolely on its own organization.  Thus the whole is complete on one\r\nprinciple.  The masses of space are formed by law; law makes them in due\r\ntime theatres of existence for plants and animals; sensation,\r\ndisposition, intellect, are all in like manner developed and sustained in\r\naction by law.  It is most interesting to observe into how small a field\r\nthe whole of the mysteries of nature thus ultimately resolve themselves.\r\nThe inorganic has one final comprehensive law, GRAVITATION.  The organic,\r\nthe other great department of mundane things, rests in like manner on one\r\nlaw, and that is,—DEVELOPMENT.  Nor may even these be after all twain,\r\nbut only branches of one still more comprehensive law, the expression of\r\nthat unity which man’s wit can scarcely separate from Deity itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE AND GENERAL CONDITION OF THE ANIMATED CREATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have now to inquire how this view of the constitution and origin of\r\nnature bears upon the condition of man upon the earth, and his relation\r\nto supra-mundane things.\r\n\r\nThat enjoyment is the proper attendant of animal existence is pressed\r\nupon us by all that we see and all we experience.  Everywhere we perceive\r\nin the lower creatures, in their ordinary condition, symptoms of\r\nenjoyment.  Their whole being is a system of needs, the supplying of\r\nwhich is gratification, and of faculties, the exercise of which is\r\npleasurable.  When we consult our own sensations, we find that, even in a\r\nsense of a healthy performance of all the functions of the animal\r\neconomy, God has furnished us with an innocent and very high enjoyment.\r\nThe mere quiet consciousness of a healthy play of the mental functions—a\r\nmind at ease with itself and all around it—is in like manner extremely\r\nagreeable.  This negative class of enjoyments, it may be remarked, is\r\nlikely to be even more extensively experienced by the lower animals than\r\nby man, at least in the proportion of their absolute endowments, as their\r\nmental and bodily functions are much less liable to derangement than\r\nours.  To find the world constituted on this principle is only what in\r\nreason we would expect.  We cannot conceive that so vast a system could\r\nhave been created for a contrary purpose.  No averagely constituted human\r\nbeing would, in his own limited sphere of action, think of producing a\r\nsimilar system upon an opposite principle.  But to form so vast a range\r\nof being, and to make being everywhere a source of gratification, is\r\nconformable to our ideas of a Creator in whom we are constantly\r\ndiscovering traits of a nature, of which our own is but a faint and\r\nfar-cast shadow at the best.\r\n\r\nIt appears at first difficult to reconcile with this idea the many\r\nmiseries which we see all sentient beings, ourselves included,\r\noccasionally enduring.  How, the sage has asked in every age, should a\r\nBeing so transcendently kind, have allowed of so large an admixture of\r\nevil in the condition of his creatures?  Do we not at length find an\r\nanswer to a certain extent satisfactory, in the view which has now been\r\ngiven of the constitution of nature?  We there see the Deity operating in\r\nthe most august of his works by fixed laws, an arrangement which, it is\r\nclear, only admits of the main and primary results being good, but\r\ndisregards exceptions.  Now the mechanical laws are so definite in their\r\npurposes, that no exceptions ever take place in that department; if there\r\nis a certain quantity of nebulous matter to be agglomerated and divided\r\nand set in motion as a planetary system, it will be so with\r\nhair’s-breadth accuracy, and cannot be otherwise.  But the laws presiding\r\nover meteorology, life, and mind, are necessarily less definite, as they\r\nhave to produce a great variety of mutually related results.  Left to act\r\nindependently of each other, each according to its separate commission,\r\nand each with a wide range of potentiality to be modified by associated\r\nconditions, they can only have effects generally beneficial: often there\r\nmust be an interference of one law with another, often a law will chance\r\nto operate in excess, or upon a wrong object, and thus evil will be\r\nproduced.  Thus, winds are generally useful in many ways, and the sea is\r\nuseful as a means of communication between one country and another; but\r\nthe natural laws which produce winds are of indefinite range of action,\r\nand sometimes are unusually concentrated in space or in time, so as to\r\nproduce storms and hurricanes, by which much damage is done; the sea may\r\nbe by these causes violently agitated, so that many barks and many lives\r\nperish.  Here, it is evident, the evil is only exceptive.  Suppose,\r\nagain, that a boy, in the course of the lively sports proper to his age,\r\nsuffers a fall which injures his spine, and renders him a cripple for\r\nlife.  Two things have been concerned in the case: first, the love of\r\nviolent exercise, and second, the law of gravitation.  Both of these\r\nthings are good in the main.  In the rash enterprises and rough sports in\r\nwhich boys engage, they prepare their bodies and minds for the hard tasks\r\nof life.  By gravitation, all moveable things, our own bodies included,\r\nare kept stable on the surface of the earth.  But when it chances that\r\nthe playful boy loses his hold (we shall say) of the branch of a tree,\r\nand has no solid support immediately below, the law of gravitation\r\nunrelentingly pulls him to the ground, and thus he is hurt.  Now it was\r\nnot a primary object of gravitation to injure boys; but gravitation could\r\nnot but operate in the circumstances, its nature being to be universal\r\nand invariable.  The evil is, therefore, only a casual exception from\r\nsomething in the main good.\r\n\r\nThe same explanation applies to even the most conspicuous of the evils\r\nwhich afflict society.  War, it may be said, and said truly, is a\r\ntremendous example of evil, in the misery, hardship, waste of human life,\r\nand mis-spending of human energies, which it occasions.  But what is it\r\nthat produces war?  Certain tendencies of human nature, as keen assertion\r\nof a supposed right, resentment of supposed injury, acquisitiveness,\r\ndesire of admiration, combativeness, or mere love of excitement.  All of\r\nthese are tendencies which are every day, in a legitimate extent of\r\naction, producing great and indispensable benefits to us.  Man would be a\r\ntame, indolent, unserviceable being without them, and his fate would be\r\nstarvation.  War, then, huge evil though it be, is, after all, but the\r\nexceptive case, a casual misdirection of properties and powers\r\nessentially good.  God has given us the tendencies for a benevolent\r\npurpose.  He has only not laid down any absolute obstruction to our\r\nmisuse of them.  That were an arrangement of a kind which he has nowhere\r\nmade.  But he has established many laws in our nature which tend to\r\nlessen the frequency and destructiveness of these abuses.  Our reason\r\ncomes to see that war is purely an evil, even to the conqueror.\r\nBenevolence interposes to make its ravages less mischievous to human\r\ncomfort, and less destructive to human life.  Men begin to find that\r\ntheir more active powers can be exercised with equal gratification on\r\nlegitimate objects; for example, in overcoming the natural difficulties\r\nof their path through life, or in a generous spirit of emulation in a\r\nline of duty beneficial to themselves and their fellow-creatures.  Thus,\r\nwar at length shrinks into a comparatively narrow compass, though there\r\ncertainly is no reason to suppose that it will be at any early period, if\r\never, altogether dispensed with, while man’s constitution remains as it\r\nis.  In considering an evil of this kind, we must not limit our view to\r\nour own or any past time.  Placed upon the earth with faculties prepared\r\nto act, but inexperienced, and with the more active propensities\r\nnecessarily in great force to suit the condition of the globe, man was\r\napt to misuse his powers much in this way at first, compared with what he\r\nis likely to do when he advances into a condition of civilization.  In\r\nthe scheme of providence, thousands of years of frequent warfare, all the\r\nso-called glories which fill history, may be only an exception to the\r\ngeneral rule.\r\n\r\nThe sex passion in like manner leads to great evils; but the evils are\r\nonly an exception from the vast mass of good connected with this\r\naffection.  Providence has seen it necessary to make very ample provision\r\nfor the preservation and utmost possible extension of all species.  The\r\naim seems to be to diffuse existence as widely as possible, to fill up\r\nevery vacant piece of space with some sentient being to be a vehicle of\r\nenjoyment.  Hence this passion is conferred in great force.  But the\r\nrelation between the number of beings, and the means of supporting them,\r\nis only on the footing of general law.  There may be occasional\r\ndiscrepancies between the laws operating for the multiplication of\r\nindividuals, and the laws operating to supply them with the means of\r\nsubsistence, and evils will be endured in consequence, even in our own\r\nhighly favoured species.  But against all these evils, and against those\r\nnumberless vexations which have arisen in all ages from the attachment of\r\nthe sexes, place the vast amount of happiness which is derived from this\r\nsource—the basis of the whole circle of the domestic affections, the\r\nsweetening principle of life, the prompter of all our most generous\r\nfeelings, and even of our most virtuous resolves—and every ill that can\r\nbe traced to it is but as dust in the balance.  And here, also, we must\r\nbe on our guard against judging from what we see in the world at a\r\nparticular era.  As reason and the higher sentiments of man’s nature\r\nincrease in force, this passion is put under better regulation, so as to\r\nlessen many of the evils connected with it.  The civilized man is more\r\nable to give it due control; his attachments are less the result of\r\nimpulse; he studies more the weal of his partner and offspring.  There\r\nare even some of the resentful feelings connected in early society with\r\nlove, such as hatred of successful rivalry, and jealousy, which almost\r\ndisappear in an advanced stage of civilization.  The evils springing, in\r\nour own species at least, from this passion, may therefore be an\r\nexception mainly peculiar to a particular term of the world’s progress,\r\nand which may be expected to decrease greatly in amount.\r\n\r\nWith respect, again, to disease, so prolific a cause of suffering to man,\r\nthe human constitution is merely a complicated but regular process in\r\nelectro-chemistry, which goes on well, and is a source of continual\r\ngratification, so long as nothing occurs to interfere with it\r\ninjuriously, but which is liable every moment to be deranged by various\r\nexternal agencies, when it becomes a source of pain, and, if the injury\r\nbe severe, ceases to be capable of retaining life.  It may be readily\r\nadmitted that the evils experienced in this way are very great; but,\r\nafter all, such experiences are no more than occasional, and not\r\nnecessarily frequent—exceptions from a general rule of which the direct\r\naction is to confer happiness.  The human constitution might have been\r\nmade of a more hardy character; but we always see hardiness and\r\ninsensibility go together, and it may be of course presumed that we only\r\ncould have purchased this immunity from suffering at the expense of a\r\nlarge portion of that delicacy in which lie some of our most agreeable\r\nsensations.  Or man’s faculties might have been restricted to\r\ndefiniteness of action, as is greatly the case with those of the lower\r\nanimals, and thus we should have been equally safe from the aberrations\r\nwhich lead to disease; but in that event we should have been incapable of\r\nacting to so many different purposes as we are, and of the many high\r\nenjoyments which the varied action of our faculties places in our power:\r\nwe should not, in short, have been human beings, but merely on a level\r\nwith the inferior animals.  Thus, it appears, that the very fineness of\r\nman’s constitution, that which places him in such a high relation to the\r\nmundane economy, and makes him the vehicle of so many exquisitely\r\ndelightful sensations—it is this which makes him liable to the sufferings\r\nof disease.  It might be said, on the other hand, that the noxiousness of\r\nthe agencies producing disease might have been diminished or\r\nextinguished; but the probability is, that this could not have been done\r\nwithout such a derangement of the whole economy of nature as would have\r\nbeen attended with more serious evils.  For example—a large class of\r\ndiseases are the result of effluvia from decaying organic matter.  This\r\nkind of matter is known to be extremely useful, when mixed with earth, in\r\nfavouring the process of vegetation.  Supposing the noxiousness to the\r\nhuman constitution done away with, might we not also lose that important\r\nquality which tends so largely to increase the food raised from the\r\nground?  Perhaps (as has been suggested) the noxiousness is even a matter\r\nof special design, to induce us to put away decaying organic substances\r\ninto the earth, where they are calculated to be so useful.  Now man has\r\nreason to enable him to see that such substances are beneficial under one\r\narrangement, and noxious in the other.  He is, as it were, commanded to\r\ntake the right method in dealing with it.  In point of fact, men do not\r\nalways take this method, but allow accumulations of noxious matter to\r\ngather close about their dwellings, where they generate fevers and agues.\r\nBut their doing so may be regarded as only a temporary exception from the\r\noperation of mental laws, the general tendency of which is to make men\r\nadopt the proper measures.  And these measures will probably be in time\r\nuniversally adopted, so that one extensive class of diseases will be\r\naltogether or nearly abolished.\r\n\r\nAnother large class of diseases spring from mismanagement of our personal\r\neconomy.  Eating to excess, eating and drinking what is noxious,\r\ndisregard to that cleanliness which is necessary for the right action of\r\nthe functions of the skin, want of fresh air for the supply of the lungs,\r\nundue, excessive, and irregular indulgence of the mental affections, are\r\nall of them recognised modes of creating that derangement of the system\r\nin which disease consists.  Here also it may be said that a limitation of\r\nthe mental faculties to definite manifestations (_vulgo_, instincts)\r\nmight have enabled us to avoid many of these errors; but here again we\r\nare met by the consideration that, if we had been so endowed, we should\r\nhave been only as the lower animals are, wanting that transcendently\r\nhigher character of sensation and power, by which our enjoyments are made\r\nso much greater.  In making the desire of food, for example, with us an\r\nindefinite mental manifestation, instead of the definite one, which it is\r\namongst the lower animals, the Creator has given us a means of deriving\r\nfar greater gratifications from food (consistently with health) than the\r\nlower animals appear to be capable of.  He has also given us reason to\r\nact as a guiding and controlling power over this and other propensities,\r\nso that they may be prevented from becoming causes of malady.  We can see\r\nthat excess is injurious, and are thus prompted to moderation.  We can\r\nsee that all the things which we feel inclined to take are not healthful,\r\nand are thus exhorted to avoid what are pernicious.  We can also see that\r\na cleanly skin and a constant supply of pure air are necessary to the\r\nproper performance of some of the most important of the organic\r\nfunctions, and thus are stimulated to frequent ablution, and to a right\r\nventilation of our parlours and sleeping apartments.  And so on with the\r\nother causes of disease.  Reason may not operate very powerfully to these\r\npurposes in an early state of society, and prodigious evils may therefore\r\nhave been endured from disease in past ages; but these are not\r\nnecessarily to be endured always.  As civilization advances, reason\r\nacquires a greater ascendancy; the causes of the evils are seen and\r\navoided; and disease shrinks into a comparatively narrow compass.  The\r\nexperience of our own country places this in a striking light.  In the\r\nmiddle ages, when large towns had no police regulations, society was\r\nevery now and then scourged by pestilence.  The third of the people of\r\nEurope are said to have been carried off by one epidemic.  Even in London\r\nthe annual mortality has greatly sunk within a century.  The improvement\r\nin human life, which has taken place since the construction of the\r\nNorthampton tables by Dr. Price, is equally remarkable.  Modern tables\r\nstill shew a prodigious mortality among the young in all civilized\r\ncountries—evidently a result of some prevalent error in the usual modes\r\nof rearing them.  But to remedy this evil there is the sagacity of the\r\nhuman mind, and the sense to adopt any reformed plans which may be shewn\r\nto be necessary.  By a change in the management of an orphan institution\r\nin London, during the last fifty years, an immense reduction in the\r\nmortality took place.  We may of course hope to see measures devised and\r\nadopted for producing a similar improvement of infant life throughout the\r\nworld at large.\r\n\r\nIn this part of our subject, the most difficult point certainly lies in\r\nthose occurrences of disease where the afflicted individual has been in\r\nno degree concerned in bringing the visitation upon himself.  Daily\r\nexperience shews us infectious disease arising in a place where the\r\nnatural laws in respect of cleanliness are neglected, and then spreading\r\ninto regions where there is no blame of this kind.  We then see the\r\ninnocent suffering equally with those who may be called the guilty.  Nay,\r\nthe benevolent physician who comes to succour the miserable beings whose\r\nerror may have caused the mischief, is sometimes seen to fall a victim to\r\nit, while many of his patients recover.  We are also only too familiar\r\nwith the transmission of diseases from erring parents to innocent\r\nchildren, who, accordingly suffer, and perhaps die prematurely, as it\r\nwere for the sins of others.  After all, however painful such cases may\r\nbe in contemplation, they cannot be regarded in any other light than as\r\nexceptions from arrangements, the general working of which is beneficial.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the innocence of the suffering parties, there is one\r\nimportant consideration which is pressed upon us from many quarters,\r\nnamely—that moral conditions have not the least concern in the working of\r\nthese simply physical laws.  These laws proceed with an entire\r\nindependence of all such conditions, and desirably so, for otherwise\r\nthere could be no certain dependence placed upon them.  Thus it may\r\nhappen that two persons ascending a piece of scaffolding, the one a\r\nvirtuous, the other a vicious man, the former, being the less cautious of\r\nthe two, ventures upon an insecure place, falls, and is killed, while the\r\nother, choosing a better footing, remains uninjured.  It is not in what\r\nwe can conceive of the nature of things, that there should be a special\r\nexemption from the ordinary laws of matter, to save this virtuous man.\r\nSo it might be that, of two physicians, attending fever cases, in a mean\r\npart of a large city, the one, an excellent citizen, may stand in such a\r\nposition with respect to the beds of the patients as to catch the\r\ninfection, of which he dies in a few days, while the other, a bad husband\r\nand father, and who, unlike the other, only attends such cases with\r\nselfish ends, takes care to be as much as possible out of the stream of\r\ninfection, and accordingly escapes.  In both of these cases man’s sense\r\nof good and evil—his faculty of conscientiousness—would incline him to\r\ndestine the vicious man to destruction and save the virtuous.  But the\r\nGreat Ruler of Nature does not act on such principles.  He has\r\nestablished laws for the operation of inanimate matter, which are quite\r\nunswerving, so that when we know them, we have only to act in a certain\r\nway with respect to them, in order to obtain all the benefits and avoid\r\nall the evils connected with them.  He has likewise established moral\r\nlaws in our nature, which are equally unswerving, (allowing for their\r\nwider range of action,) and from obedience to which unfailing good is to\r\nbe derived.  But the two sets of laws are independent of each other.\r\nObedience to each gives only its own proper advantage, not the advantage\r\nproper to the other.  Hence it is that virtue forms no protection against\r\nthe evils connected with the physical laws, while, on the other hand, a\r\nman skilled in and attentive to these, but unrighteous and disregardful\r\nof his neighbour, is in like manner not protected by his attention to\r\nphysical circumstances from the proper consequences of neglect or breach\r\nof the moral laws.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the innocence of the party suffering for the faults of a\r\nparent, or of any other person or set of persons, is evidently a\r\nconsideration quite apart from that suffering.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, moreover, from the whole scope of the natural laws, that the\r\nindividual, as far as the present sphere of being is concerned, is to the\r\nAuthor of Nature a consideration of inferior moment.  Everywhere we see\r\nthe arrangements for the species perfect; the individual is left, as it\r\nwere, to take his chance amidst the _mêlée_ of the various laws affecting\r\nhim.  If he be found inferiorly endowed, or ill befalls him, there was at\r\nleast no partiality against him.  The system has the fairness of a\r\nlottery, in which every one has the like chance of drawing the prize.\r\n\r\nYet it is also to be observed that few evils are altogether unmixed.\r\nGod, contemplating apparently the unbending action of his great laws, has\r\nestablished others which appear to be designed to have a compensating, a\r\nrepairing, and a consoling effect.  Suppose, for instance, that, from a\r\ndefect in the power of development in a mother, her offspring is ushered\r\ninto the world destitute of some of the most useful members, or blind, or\r\ndeaf, or of imperfect intellect, there is ever to be found in the parents\r\nand other relatives, and in the surrounding public, a sympathy with the\r\nsufferer, which tends to make up for the deficiency, so that he is in the\r\nlong run not much a loser.  Indeed, the benevolence implanted in our\r\nnature seems to be an arrangement having for one of its principal objects\r\nto cause us, by sympathy and active aid, to remedy the evils unavoidably\r\nsuffered by our fellow-creatures in the course of the operation of the\r\nother natural laws.  And even in the sufferer himself, it is often found\r\nthat a defect in one point is made up for by an extra power in another.\r\nThe blind come to have a sense of touch much more acute than those who\r\nsee.  Persons born without hands have been known to acquire a power of\r\nusing their feet for a number of the principal offices usually served by\r\nthat member.  I need hardly say how remarkably fatuity is compensated by\r\nthe more than usual regard paid to the children born with it by their\r\nparents, and the zeal which others usually feel to protect and succour\r\nsuch persons.  In short, we never see evil of any kind take place where\r\nthere is not some remedy or compensating principle ready to interfere for\r\nits alleviation.  And there can be no doubt that in this manner suffering\r\nof all kinds is very much relieved.\r\n\r\nWe may, then, regard the globes of space as theatres designed for the\r\nresidence of animated sentient beings, placed there with this as their\r\nfirst and most obvious purpose—namely, to be sensible of enjoyments from\r\nthe exercise of their faculties in relation to external things.  The\r\nfaculties of the various species are very different, but the happiness of\r\neach depends on the harmony there may be between its particular faculties\r\nand its particular circumstances.  For instance, place the small-brained\r\nsheep or ox in a good pasture, and it fully enjoys this harmony of\r\nrelation; but man, having many more faculties, cannot be thus contented.\r\nBesides having a sufficiency of food and bodily comfort, he must have\r\nentertainment for his intellect, whatever be its grade, objects for the\r\ndomestic and social affections, objects for the sentiments.  He is also a\r\nprogressive being, and what pleases him to-day may not please him\r\nto-morrow; but, in each case he demands a sphere of appropriate\r\nconditions in order to be happy.  By virtue of his superior organization,\r\nhis enjoyments are much higher and more varied than those of any of the\r\nlower animals; but the very complexity of circumstances affecting him\r\nrenders it at the same time unavoidable, that his nature should be often\r\ninharmoniously placed and disagreeably affected, and that he should\r\ntherefore be unhappy.  Still unhappiness amongst mankind is the exception\r\nfrom the rule of their condition, and an exception which is capable of\r\nalmost infinite diminution, by virtue of the improving reason of man, and\r\nthe experience which he acquires in working out the problems of society.\r\n\r\nTo secure the immediate means of happiness it would seem to be necessary\r\nfor men first to study with all care the constitution of nature, and,\r\nsecondly, to accommodate themselves to that constitution, so as to obtain\r\nall the realizable advantages from acting conformably to it, and to avoid\r\nall likely evils from disregarding it.  It will be of no use to sit down\r\nand expect that things are to operate of their own accord, or through the\r\ndirection of a partial deity, for our benefit; equally so were it to\r\nexpose ourselves to palpable dangers, under the notion that we shall, for\r\nsome reason, have a dispensation or exemption from them: we must\r\nendeavour so to place ourselves, and so to act, that the arrangements\r\nwhich Providence has made impartially for all may be in our favour, and\r\nnot against us; such are the only means by which we can obtain good and\r\navoid evil here below.  And, in doing this, it is especially necessary\r\nthat care be taken to avoid interfering with the like efforts of other\r\nmen, beyond what may have been agreed upon by the mass as necessary for\r\nthe general good.  Such interferences, tending in any way to injure the\r\nbody, property, or peace of a neighbour, or to the injury of society in\r\ngeneral, tend very much to reflect evil upon ourselves, through the\r\nre-action which they produce in the feelings of our neighbour and of\r\nsociety, and also the offence which they give to our own\r\nconscientiousness and benevolence.  On the other hand, when we endeavour\r\nto promote the efforts of our fellow-creatures to attain happiness, we\r\nproduce a re-action of the contrary kind, the tendency of which is\r\ntowards our own benefit.  The one course of action tends to the injury,\r\nthe other to the benefit of ourselves and others.  By the one course the\r\ngeneral design of the Creator towards his creatures is thwarted; by the\r\nother it is favoured.  And thus we can readily see the most substantial\r\ngrounds for regarding all moral emotions and doings as divine in their\r\nnature, and as a means of rising to and communing with God.  Obedience is\r\nnot selfishness, which it would otherwise be—it is worship.  The merest\r\nbarbarians have a glimmering sense of this philosophy, and it continually\r\nshines out more and more clearly in the public mind, as a nation advances\r\nin intelligence.  Nor are individuals alone concerned here.  The same\r\nrule applies as between one great body or class of men and another, and\r\nalso between nations.  Thus if one set of men keep others in the\r\ncondition of slaves—this being a gross injustice to the subjected party,\r\nthe mental manifestations of that party to the masters will be such as to\r\nmar the comfort of their lives; the minds of the masters themselves will\r\nbe degraded by the association with beings so degraded; and thus, with\r\nsome immediate or apparent benefit from keeping slaves, there will be in\r\na far greater degree an experience of evil.  So also, if one portion of a\r\nnation, engaged in a particular department of industry, grasp at some\r\nadvantages injurious to the other sections of the people, the first\r\neffect will be an injury to those other portions of the nation, and the\r\nsecond a re-active injury to the injurers, making their guilt their\r\npunishment.  And so when one nation commits an aggression upon the\r\nproperty or rights of another, or even pursues towards it a sordid or\r\nungracious policy, the effects are sure to be redoubled evil from the\r\noffended party.  All of these things are under laws which make the\r\neffects, on a large range, absolutely certain; and an individual, a\r\nparty, a people, can no more act unjustly with safety, than I could with\r\nsafety place my leg in the track of a coming wain, or attempt to fast\r\nthirty days.  We have been constituted on the principle of only being\r\nable to realize happiness for ourselves when our fellow-creatures are\r\nalso happy; we must therefore both do to others only as we would have\r\nothers to do to us, and endeavour to promote their happiness as well as\r\nour own, in order to find ourselves truly comfortable in this field of\r\nexistence.  These are words which God speaks to us as truly through his\r\nworks, as if we heard them uttered in his own voice from heaven.\r\n\r\nIt will occur to every one, that the system here unfolded does not imply\r\nthe most perfect conceivable love or regard on the part of the Deity\r\ntowards his creatures.  Constituted as we are, feeling how vain our\r\nefforts often are to attain happiness or avoid calamity, and knowing that\r\nmuch evil does unavoidably befall us from no fault of ours, we are apt to\r\nfeel that this is a dreary view of the Divine economy; and before we have\r\nlooked farther, we might be tempted to say, Far rather let us cling to\r\nthe idea, so long received, that the Deity acts continually for special\r\noccasions, and gives such directions to the fate of each individual as he\r\nthinks meet; so that, when sorrow comes to us, we shall have at least the\r\nconsolation of believing that it is imposed by a Father who loves us, and\r\nwho seeks by these means to accomplish our ultimate good.  Now, in the\r\nfirst place, if this be an untrue notion of the Deity and his ways, it\r\ncan be of no real benefit to us; and, in the second, it is proper to\r\ninquire if there be necessarily in the doctrine of natural law any\r\npeculiarity calculated materially to affect our hitherto supposed\r\nrelation to the Deity.  It may be that while we are committed to take our\r\nchance in a natural system of undeviating operation, and are left with\r\napparent ruthlessness to endure the consequences of every collision into\r\nwhich we knowingly or unknowingly come with each law of the system, there\r\nis a system of Mercy and Grace behind the screen of nature, which is to\r\nmake up for all casualties endured here, and the very largeness of which\r\nis what makes these casualties a matter of indifference to God.  For the\r\nexistence of such a system, the actual constitution of nature is itself\r\nan argument.  The reasoning may proceed thus: The system of nature\r\nassures us that benevolence is a leading principle in the divine mind.\r\nBut that system is at the same time deficient in a means of making this\r\nbenevolence of invariable operation.  To reconcile this to the recognised\r\ncharacter of the Deity, it is necessary to suppose that the present\r\nsystem is but a part of a whole, a stage in a Great Progress, and that\r\nthe Redress is in reserve.  Another argument here occurs—the economy of\r\nnature, beautifully arranged and vast in its extent as it is, does not\r\nsatisfy even man’s idea of what might be; he feels that, if this\r\nmultiplicity of theatres for the exemplification of such phenomena as we\r\nsee on earth were to go on for ever unchanged, it would not be worthy of\r\nthe Being capable of creating it.  An endless monotony of human\r\ngenerations, with their humble thinkings and doings, seems an object\r\nbeneath that august Being.  But the mundane economy might be very well as\r\na portion of some greater phenomenon, the rest of which was yet to be\r\nevolved.  It therefore appears that our system, though it may at first\r\nappear at issue with other doctrines in esteem amongst mankind, tends to\r\ncome into harmony with them, and even to give them support.  I would say,\r\nin conclusion, that, even where the two above arguments may fail of\r\neffect, there may yet be a faith derived from this view of nature\r\nsufficient to sustain us under all sense of the imperfect happiness, the\r\ncalamities, the woes, and pains of this sphere of being.  For let us but\r\nfully and truly consider what a system is here laid open to view, and we\r\ncannot well doubt that we are in the hands of One who is both able and\r\nwilling to do us the most entire justice.  And in this faith we may well\r\nrest at ease, even though life should have been to us but a protracted\r\ndisease, or though every hope we had built on the secular materials\r\nwithin our reach were felt to be melting from our grasp.  Thinking of all\r\nthe contingencies of this world as to be in time melted into or lost in\r\nthe greater system, to which the present is only subsidiary, let us wait\r\nthe end with patience, and be of good cheer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE CONCLUSORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHUS ends a book, composed in solitude, and almost without the cognizance\r\nof a single human being, for the sole purpose (or as nearly so as may be)\r\nof improving the knowledge of mankind, and through that medium their\r\nhappiness.  For reasons which need not be specified, the author’s name is\r\nretained in its original obscurity, and, in all probability, will never\r\nbe generally known.  I do not expect that any word of praise which the\r\nwork may elicit shall ever be responded to by me; or that any word of\r\ncensure shall ever be parried or deprecated.  It goes forth to take its\r\nchance of instant oblivion, or of a long and active course of usefulness\r\nin the world.  Neither contingency can be of any importance to me, beyond\r\nthe regret or the satisfaction which may be imparted by my sense of a\r\nlost or a realized benefit to my fellow-creatures.  The book, as far as I\r\nam aware, is the first attempt to connect the natural sciences into a\r\nhistory of creation.  The idea is a bold one, and there are many\r\ncircumstances of time and place to render its boldness more than usually\r\nconspicuous.  But I believe my doctrines to be in the main true; I\r\nbelieve all truth to be valuable, and its dissemination a blessing.  At\r\nthe same time, I hold myself duly sensible of the common liability to\r\nerror, but am certain that no error in this line has the least chance of\r\nbeing allowed to injure the public mind.  Therefore I publish.  My views,\r\nif correct, will most assuredly stand, and may sooner or later prove\r\nbeneficial; if otherwise, they will as surely pass out of notice without\r\ndoing any harm.\r\n\r\nMy sincere desire in the composition of the book was to give the true\r\nview of the history of nature, with as little disturbance as possible to\r\nexisting beliefs, whether philosophical or religious.  I have made little\r\nreference to any doctrines of the latter kind which may be thought\r\ninconsistent with mine, because to do so would have been to enter upon\r\nquestions for the settlement of which our knowledge is not yet ripe.  Let\r\nthe reconciliation of whatever is true in my views with whatever is true\r\nin other systems come about in the fulness of calm and careful inquiry.\r\nI cannot but here remind the reader of what Dr. Wiseman has shewn so\r\nstrikingly in his lectures, how different new philosophic doctrines are\r\napt to appear after we have become somewhat familiar with them.  Geology\r\nat first seems inconsistent with the authority of the Mosaic record.  A\r\nstorm of unreasoning indignation rises against its teachers.  In time,\r\nits truths, being found quite irresistible, are admitted, and mankind\r\ncontinue to regard the Scriptures with the same respect as before.  So\r\nalso with several other sciences.  Now the only objection that can be\r\nmade on such ground to this book, is, that it brings forward some new\r\nhypotheses, at first sight, like geology, not in perfect harmony with\r\nthat record, and arranges all the rest into a system which partakes of\r\nthe same character.  But may not the sacred text, on a liberal\r\ninterpretation, or with the benefit of new light reflected from nature,\r\nor derived from learning, be shewn to be as much in harmony with the\r\nnovelties of this volume as it has been with geology and natural\r\nphilosophy?  What is there in the laws of organic creation more startling\r\nto the candid theologian than in the Copernican system or the natural\r\nformation of strata?  And if the whole series of facts is true, why\r\nshould we shrink from inferences legitimately flowing from it?  Is it not\r\na wiser course, since reconciliation has come in so many instances, still\r\nto hope for it, still to go on with our new truths, trusting that they\r\nalso will in time be found harmonious with all others?  Thus we avoid the\r\ndamage which the very appearance of an opposition to natural truth is\r\ncalculated to inflict on any system presumed to require such support.\r\nThus we give, as is meet, a respectful reception to what is revealed\r\nthrough the medium of nature, at the same time that we fully reserve our\r\nreverence for all we have been accustomed to hold sacred, not one tittle\r\nof which it may ultimately be found necessary to alter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n{3}  By Mr. Henderson, Professor of Astronomy in the Edinburgh\r\nUniversity, and Lieutenant Meadows.\r\n\r\n{5}  Made by M.

It has been thought that their path is retrograde\r\ncompared with the rest.  Perhaps this may be owing to a _bouleversement_\r\nof the primary, for the inclination of its equator to the ecliptic is\r\nadmitted to be unusually high; but the subject is altogether so obscure,\r\nthat nothing can be founded on it.\r\n\r\n{12}  Astronomy, Lardner’s Cyclopædia.\r\n\r\n{17}  M. Compte combined Huygens’s theorems for the measure of\r\ncentrifugal force with the law of gravitation, and thus formed a simple\r\nfundamental equation between the duration of the rotation of what he\r\ncalls the producing star, and the distance of the star produced.  The\r\nconstants of this equation were the radius of the central star, and the\r\nintensity of gravity at its surface, which is a direct consequence of its\r\nmass.  It leads directly to the third law of Kepler, which thus becomes\r\nsusceptible of being conceived _à priori_ in a cosmogonical point of\r\nview.  M. Compte first applied it to the moon, and found, to his great\r\ndelight, that the periodic time of that satellite agrees within an hour\r\nor two with the duration which the revolution of the earth ought to have\r\nhad at the time when the lunar distance formed the limit of the earth’s\r\natmosphere.  He found the coincidence less exact, but still very striking\r\nin every other case.  In those of the planets he obtained for the\r\nduration of the corresponding solar rotations a value always a little\r\nless than their actual periodic times.  “It is remarkable,” says he,\r\n“that this difference, though increasing as the planet is more distant,\r\npreserves very nearly the same relation to the corresponding periodic\r\ntime, of which it commonly forms the forty-fifth part,”—shewing, we may\r\nsuppose, that only some small elements of the question had been\r\noverlooked by the calculator.  The defect changes to an excess in the\r\ndifferent systems of the satellites, where it is proportionally greater\r\nthan in the planets, and unequal in the different systems.  “From the\r\nwhole of these comparisons,” says he, “I deduced the following general\r\nresult:—Supposing the mathematical limit of the solar atmosphere\r\nsuccessively extended to the regions where the different planets are now\r\nfound, the duration of the sun’s rotation was, at each of these epochs,\r\nsensibly equal to that of the actual sidereal revolution of the\r\ncorresponding planet; and the same is true for each planetary atmosphere\r\nin relation to the different satellites.”—_Cours de Philosophie Positif_.\r\n\r\n{42}  The researches on this subject were conducted chiefly by the late\r\nBaron Fourier, perpetual secretary to the Academy of Sciences of Paris.\r\nSee his _Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur_.  1822.\r\n\r\n{52}  Delabeche’s Geological Researches.\r\n\r\n{60}  In the Cumbrian limestone occur “calamoporæ, lithodendra,\r\ncyathophylla, and orbicula.”—_Philips_.

The precipitation of the mercury, in the form of\r\nan Arbor Dianæ, will then take place, slowly, only when the syphon is\r\nplaced in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic meridian; but if it be\r\nplaced in a plane coinciding with the magnetic meridian, the action is\r\nrapid, and the crystallization particularly beautiful, taking place\r\nprincipally in that branch of the syphon towards the north.

It\r\nrepresents, accordingly, before the second month of utero-gestation, that\r\nof an avertebrated animal; at the second month, that of an osseous fish;\r\nat the third, that of a turtle; at the fourth, that of a bird; at the\r\nfifth, that of one of the rodentia; at the sixth, that of one of the\r\nruminantia; at the seventh, that of one of the digitigrada; at the\r\neighth, that of one of the quadrumana; till at length, at the ninth, it\r\ncompasses the brain of Man!  It is hardly necessary to say, that all this\r\nis only an approximation to the truth; since neither is the brain of all\r\nosseous fishes, of all turtles, of all birds, nor of all the species of\r\nany one of the above order of mammals, by any means precisely the same,\r\nnor does the brain of the human fœtus at any time precisely resemble,\r\nperhaps, that of any individual whatever among the lower animals.\r\nNevertheless, it may be said to represent, at each of the above-mentioned\r\nperiods, the aggregate, as it were, of the brains of each of the tribes\r\nstated; consisting as it does, about the second month, chiefly of the\r\nmesial parts of the cerebellum, the corpora quadrigemina, thalami optici,\r\nrudiments of the hemispheres of the cerebrum and corpora striata; and\r\nreceiving in succession, at the third, the rudiments of the lobes of the\r\ncerebrum; at the fourth, those of the fornix, corpus callosum, and septum\r\nlucidum; at the fifth, the tubor annulare, and so forth; the posterior\r\nlobes of the cerebrum increasing from before to behind, so as to cover\r\nthe thalami optici about the fourth month, the corpora quadrigemina about\r\nthe sixth, and the cerebellum about the seventh.  This, then, is another\r\nexample of an increase in the complexity of an organ succeeding its\r\ncentralization; as if Nature, having first piled up her materials in one\r\nspot, delighted afterwards to employ her abundance, not so much in\r\nenlarging old parts as in forming new ones upon the old foundations, and\r\nthus adding to the complexity of a fabric, the rudimental structure of\r\nwhich is in all animals equally simple.”—_Fletcher’s Rudiments of\r\nPhysiology_.\r\n\r\n{226}  Project Gutenberg note: the table in the book is very wide.

The Celtic has been established as a member or group of\r\nthe Indo-European family, by the work of Dr. Prichard, _on the Eastern\r\nOrigin of the Celtic Nations_.  “First,” says Dr. Wiseman, “he has\r\nexamined the lexical resemblances, and shewn that the primary and most\r\nsimple words are the same in both, as well as the numerals and elementary\r\nverbal roots.  Then follows a minute analysis of the verb, directed to\r\nshew its analogies with other languages, and they are such as manifest no\r\ncasual coincidence, but an internal structure radically the same.  The\r\nverb substantive, which is minutely analysed, presents more striking\r\nanalogies to the Persian verb than perhaps any other language of the\r\nfamily.  But Celtic is not thus become a mere member of this confederacy,\r\nbut has brought to it most important aid; for, from it alone can be\r\nsatisfactorily explained some of the conjugational endings in the other\r\nlanguages.  For instance, the third person plural of the Latin, Persian,\r\nGreek, and Sanscrit ends in nt, nd, ντι, ντο, nti, or nt.  Now,\r\nsupposing, with most grammarians, that the inflexions arose from the\r\npronouns of the respective persons, it is only in Celtic that we find a\r\npronoun that can explain this termination; for there, too, the same\r\nperson ends in nt, and thus corresponds exactly, as do the others, with\r\nits pronoun, _hwynt_, or _ynt_.”\r\n\r\n{291}  Schoolcraft.\r\n\r\n{293}  Views of the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\n{302}  The problem of Chinese civilization, such as it is—so puzzling\r\nwhen we consider that they are only, as will be presently seen, the child\r\nrace of mankind—is solved when we look to geographical position producing\r\nfixity of residence and density of population.\r\n\r\n{307a}  Lord’s Popular Physiology, explaining observations by M. Serres.\r\n\r\n{307b}  Conformably to this view, the beard, that peculiar attribute of\r\nmaturity, is scanty in the Mongolian, and scarcely exists in the\r\nAmericans and Negroes.\r\n\r\n{309}  Of this we have perhaps an illustration in the peculiarities which\r\ndistinguish the Arabs residing in the valley of the Jordan.  They have\r\nflatter features, darker skins, and coarser hair than other tribes of\r\ntheir nation; and we have seen one instance of a thoroughly Negro family\r\nbeing born to an ordinary couple.  It may be presumed that the conditions\r\nof the life of these people tend to arrest development.  We thus see how\r\nan offshoot of the human family migrating at an early period into Africa,\r\nmight in time, from subjection to similar influences, become Negroes.\r\n\r\n{317}  Missionary Scenes and Labours in South Africa.\r\n\r\n{326}  “Is not God the first cause of matter as well as of mind?  Do not\r\nthe first attributes of matter lie as inscrutable in the bosom of God—of\r\nits first author—as those of mind?  Has not even matter confessedly\r\nreceived from God the power of experiencing, in consequence of\r\nimpressions from the earlier modifications of matter, certain\r\nconsciousnesses called sensations of the same?  Is not, therefore, the\r\nwonder of matter also receiving the consciousnesses of other matter\r\ncalled ideas of the mind a wonder more flowing out of and in analogy with\r\nall former wonders, than would be, on the contrary, the wonder of this\r\nfaculty of the mind not flowing out of any faculties of matter?  Is it\r\nnot a wonder which, so far from destroying our hopes of immortality, can\r\nestablish that doctrine on a train of inferences and inductions more\r\nfirmly established and more connected with each other than the former\r\nbelief can be, as soon as we have proved that matter is not perishable,\r\nbut is only liable to successive combinations and decombinations.\r\n\r\n“Can we look farther back one way into the first origin of matter than we\r\ncan look forward the other way into the last developments of mind?  Can\r\nwe say that God has not in matter itself laid the seeds of every faculty\r\nof mind, rather than that he has made the first principle of mind\r\nentirely distinct from that of matter?  Cannot the first cause of all we\r\nsee and know have _fraught matter itself_, _from its very beginning_,\r\n_with all the attributes necessary to develop into mind_, as well as he\r\ncan have from the first made the attributes of mind wholly different from\r\nthose of matter, only in order afterwards, by an imperceptible and\r\nincomprehensible link, to join the two together?\r\n\r\n“ * * [The decombination of the matter on which mind rests] is this a\r\nreason why mind must be annihilated?  Is the temporary reverting of the\r\nmind, and of the sense out of which that mind developes, to their\r\noriginal component elements, a reason for thinking that they cannot again\r\nat another later period, and in another higher globe, be again\r\nrecombined, and with more splendour than before? * * The New Testament\r\ndoes not after death here promise us a soul hereafter unconnected with\r\nmatter, and which has no connexion with our present mind—a soul\r\nindependent of time and space.  That is a fanciful idea, not founded on\r\nits expressions, when taken in their just and real meaning.  On the\r\ncontrary, it promises us a mind like the present, founded on time and\r\nspace; since it is, like the present, to hold a certain situation in\r\ntime, and a certain locality in space.  But it promises a mind situated\r\nin portions of time and of space different from the present; a mind\r\ncomposed of elements of matter more extended, more perfect, and more\r\nglorious: a mind which, formed of materials supplied by different globes,\r\nis consequently able to see farther into the past, and to think farther\r\ninto the future, than any mind here existing: a mind which, freed from\r\nthe partial and uneven combination incidental to it on this globe, will\r\nbe exempt from the changes for evil to which, on the present globe, mind\r\nas well as matter is liable, and will only thenceforth experience the\r\nchanges for the better which matter, more justly poised, will alone\r\ncontinue to experience: a mind which, no longer fearing the death, the\r\ntotal decomposition, to which it is subject on this globe, will\r\nthenceforth continue last and immortal.”—HOPE, _on the Origin and\r\nProspects of Man_, 1831.\r\n\r\n{331}  Dublin Review, Aug. 1840.
