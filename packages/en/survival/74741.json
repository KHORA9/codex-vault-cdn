For every\r\nMan who has attended to the Subject, and duly considered the Principles\r\nupon which our Author’s Method of Culture is founded, is an equal Judge\r\nhow far his Theory is agreeable to Nature: Though it is but too true,\r\nthat few have made sufficient Experiments to be fully informed of its\r\nWorth.\r\n\r\nHow it has happened, that a Method of Culture, which proposes such\r\nAdvantages to those who shall duly prosecute it, hath been so long\r\nneglected in this Country, may be matter of Surprize to such as are not\r\nacquainted with the Characters of the Men on whom the Practice thereof\r\ndepends; but to those who know them thoroughly it can be none. For it\r\nis certain that very few of them can be prevailed on to alter their\r\nusual Methods upon any Consideration; though they are convinced that\r\ntheir continuing therein disables them from paying their Rents, and\r\nmaintaining their Families.\r\n\r\nAnd, what is still more to be lamented, these People are so much\r\nattached to their old Customs, that they are not only averse to alter\r\nthem themselves, but are moreover industrious to prevent others from\r\nsucceeding, who attempt to introduce any thing new; and indeed have\r\nit too generally in their Power, to defeat any Scheme which is not\r\nagreeable to their own Notions; seeing it must be executed by the same\r\nSort of Hands.\r\n\r\nThis naturally accounts for Mr. _Tull_’s Husbandry having been so\r\nlittle practised. But as the Methods commonly used, together with the\r\nmean Price of Grain for some Years past, have brought the Farmers\r\nevery-where so low, that they pay their Rents very ill, and in many\r\nPlaces have thrown up their Farms; the Cure of these Evils is certainly\r\nan Object worthy of the public Attention: For if the Proprietor must\r\nbe reduced to cultivate his own Lands, which cannot be done but by the\r\nHands of these indocile People, it is easy to guess on which Side his\r\nBalance of Profit and Loss will turn.\r\n\r\nThis Consideration, together with many others which might be\r\nenumerated, hath induced the Editors to recommend this Treatise once\r\nmore to the serious Attention of every one who wishes well to his\r\nCountry; in hopes that some may be prevailed upon, by regard either\r\nto the public Good or their own private Interest, to give the Method\r\nhere proposed a fair and impartial Trial: For could it be introduced\r\ninto several Parts of this Country by Men of generous Principles, their\r\nExample might, in time, establish the Practice thereof, and bring it\r\ninto general Use; which is not to be expected by any other means.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore to such only, as are qualified to judge of a Theory\r\nfrom the Principles on which it is founded, that the Editors address\r\nthemselves, desiring they will give this Essay another Reading with due\r\nAttention: and at the same time they beg leave to remind them how unfit\r\nthe common Practisers of Husbandry are to pass Judgment, either on the\r\nTheory or Practice of this Method; for which Reason it is hoped that\r\nnone will be influenced by such, but try the Experiment themselves with\r\nproper Care.\r\n\r\nAs a Motive to this, it is to be observed that, although the Method\r\nof Culture here proposed has made little Progress in _England_, it is\r\nnot like to meet with the same Neglect abroad, especially in _France_;\r\nwhere a Translation of Mr. _Tull_’s Book was undertaken, at one and\r\nthe same time, by three different Persons of Consideration, without\r\nthe Privity of each other: But afterwards, Two of them put their\r\nPapers into the Hands of the Third, Mr. _Du Hamel du Manceau_, of the\r\n_Royal Academy of Sciences_ at _Paris_, and of the _Royal Society_ at\r\n_London_; who has published a Book, intituled, _A Treatise of Tillage\r\non the Principles of Mr._ Tull. The ingenious Author has indeed altered\r\nthe Method observed by Mr. _Tull_ in his Book; yet has very exactly\r\ngiven his Principles and Rules: But as he had only seen the First\r\nEdition of the _Horse-hoeing Husbandry_, so he is very defective in\r\nhis Descriptions of the Ploughs and Drills, which in that were very\r\nimperfect, and were afterwards amended by Mr. _Tull_ in his Additions\r\nto that Essay.\r\n\r\nOne of our principal Reasons for taking Notice of this Book is, to shew\r\nthe Comparison this Author has made between the Old Method of Husbandry\r\nand the New. By his Calculation the Profits arising from the New, are\r\nconsiderably more than double those of the Old. For, according to him,\r\nthe Profits of Twenty Acres of Land for Ten Years, amount, at 10_d._\r\n¹⁄₂ _per_ Livre,\r\n\r\n                                          _l._ _s._ _d._\r\n  By the Old Method, to 3000 Livres, or   131    5    0  } _Sterling_.\r\n  By the New Method, to 7650 Livres, or   334   13    9  }\r\n\r\nwhich makes a prodigious Difference in favour of the latter. As\r\nthis Computation was made by one who cannot be supposed to have any\r\nPrejudice in favour of Mr. _Tull_’s Scheme, it will naturally find more\r\nCredit with the Public than any Comparison made by Mr. _Tull_ himself,\r\nor by such as may have an Attachment to his Principles.\r\n\r\nIt may probably be expected, that the Editors should take Notice of\r\nsuch Objections as have been made, either to Mr. _Tull_’s Theory\r\nor Practice; but we do not know any that in the least affect his\r\nPrinciples: They stand uncontroverted: Nor are there any to the\r\nPractice, which may not be equally urged against every Sort of\r\nImprovement. One of the principal which have come to our Knowlege is,\r\nits being impracticable in common Fields, which make a great Part of\r\nthis Country, without the Concurrence of every one who occupies Land in\r\nthe same Field. But doth not this equally affect the Old Husbandry? For\r\nevery such Person is obliged to keep the Turns of plowing, fallowing,\r\n_&c._ with the other Occupiers; so that if any of them were inclinable\r\nto improve their Lands, by sowing Grass-seeds, or any other Method\r\nof Culture, they are now under the same Difficulties as they would\r\nbe, were they to practise Mr. _Tull_’s Method. Therefore this is\r\nrather to be lamented as a public Misfortune, than to be brought as\r\nan Objection to the Practicableness of that Method. Others object,\r\nthat the introducing this Sort of Husbandry is unnecessary, seeing\r\nthe Improvements which are made by Grass-seeds are so considerable;\r\nbesides, that the Returns made by the Fold and the Dairy, being much\r\nquicker than those of Grain, engage the Farmer to mix Plowing and\r\nGrazing together. But when this is duly considered it can have no\r\nsort of Weight: for is it not well known that, in those Farms where\r\nthe greatest Improvements have been made by Grass-seeds, the Quantity\r\nof Dressing required for the Arable Land often runs away with most of\r\nthe Profit of the whole Farm? especially when the Price of Grain is\r\nlow. And if this be the Situation of the most improved Farms, what must\r\nbe the Case of those which chiefly consist of Arable Land; where most\r\nof the Dressing must be purchased at a great Price, and often fetched\r\nfrom a considerable Distance? Add to this the great Expence of Servants\r\nand Horses, unavoidable in Arable Farms; and it will appear how great\r\nthe Advantages are which the Grasier hath over the plowing Farmer. So\r\nthat it is much to be wished, the Practice of mixing the Two Sorts of\r\nHusbandry were more generally used in every Part of the Kingdom; which\r\nwould be far from rendering Mr. _Tull_’s Method of Culture useless;\r\nseeing that, when it is well understood, it will be found the surest\r\nMethod to improve both.\r\n\r\nFor although Mr. _Tull_ chiefly confined the Practice of his Method to\r\nthe Production of Grain (which is a great Pity), yet it may be extended\r\nto every Vegetable which is the Object of Culture in the Fields,\r\nGardens, Woods, _&c._ and perhaps may be applied to many other Crops,\r\nto equal, if not greater Advantage, than to Corn.\r\n\r\nIn the Vineyard it has been long practised with Success; and may be\r\nused in the Hop-Ground with no less Advantage. For the Culture of\r\nBeans, Peas, Woad, Madder, and other large-growing Vegetables; as\r\nalso for Lucern, Saintfoin, and the larger Grasses; we dare venture\r\nto pronounce it the only Method of Culture for Profit to the Farmer;\r\nseeing that, in all these Crops, one Sixth Part of the Seeds now\r\ncommonly sown will be sufficient for the same Quantity of Land, and the\r\nCrop in Return will be much greater; which, when the Expence of Seeds\r\nis duly considered, will be found no small Saving to the Farmer.\r\n\r\nNor should this Method of Culture be confined to _Europe_: for it\r\nmay be practised to as great Advantage in the _British_ Colonies in\r\n_America_, where, in the Culture of the Sugar-Cane, Indigo, Cotton,\r\nRice, and almost all the Crops of that Country, it will certainly save\r\na great Expence of Labour, and improve the Growth of every Plant, more\r\nthan can be imagined by such as are ignorant of the Benefit arising\r\nfrom this Culture. And should the Subjects of _Great Britain_ neglect\r\nto introduce this Method into her Colonies, it may be presumed our\r\nNeighbours will take care not to _be blameable on this Head_; for they\r\nseem to be as intent upon extending every Branch of Trade, and making\r\nthe greatest Improvements of their Land, as we are indifferent to both:\r\nSo that, unless a contrary Spirit be soon exerted, the Balance of\r\nTrade, Power, and every other Advantage, must be against us.\r\n\r\nThere have been Objections made by some to Mr. _Tull_’s Method, as\r\nif it were practicable only on such Lands as are soft and light, and\r\nnot at all on stiff and stony Ground. That it hath not been practised\r\non either of these Lands in _England_ we are willing to grant; but\r\nwe must not from thence infer that it is impossible to apply it to\r\nthem. For the Hoe-Plough has been very long used in the Vineyards in\r\nmany Countries, where the Soil is stronger, and abounds with Stones\r\nfull as much as any Part of this Country. However, though the Use of\r\nthis Plough may be attended with some Difficulties upon such Land,\r\nfor Wheat, or Plants of low Growth, whose Roots may be in Danger of\r\nbeing turned out of the Ground, or their Tops buried by the Clods or\r\nStones; yet none of the larger-growing Plants are subject to the same\r\nInconveniencies. Besides, the stronger the Soil is, the more Benefit\r\nwill it receive from this Method of Culture, if the Land be thereby\r\nmore pulverized; which will certainly be the Consequence, where the\r\nMethod laid down by Mr. _Tull_ is duly observed.\r\n\r\nBut as most Instruments, in their First Use, are attended with\r\nsome Difficulty, especially in the Hands of such as are indocile,\r\nthe Hoe-plough has been complained of, as cumbersome and unwieldy\r\nto the Horse and Ploughman. But perhaps this arises chiefly from\r\nthe Unwillingness of the Workmen to introduce any new Instrument:\r\nIndeed, seeing little is to be expected from those who have been long\r\nattached to different Methods, the surest Way to promote the Use of\r\nit, is to engage young Persons, who may probably be better disposed,\r\nto make the Trial at their first entering into Business; and then a\r\nlittle Use will make it easy. It is proper to observe here, that the\r\nSwing-plough, which is commonly used in the deep Land about _London_,\r\nwill do the Business of the Hoe-plough in all Ground that is not very\r\nstrong, or very stony; and that where it is so, the Foot-plough, made\r\nproportionably strong, will completely answer all Purposes. But it must\r\nbe remembered, that when these are used to hoe Corn, the Board on the\r\nLeft Hand of the Plough, answering the Mould-Board, must be taken off;\r\notherwise so much Earth will run to the Left Side, as to injure the\r\nCrop when it is low.\r\n\r\nThe _Drills_ are excellent Instruments; yet we imagine them capable of\r\nsome farther Improvement. Parallel Grooves, at about an Inch asunder,\r\nround the Inside of the Hopper, would shew the Man who follows the\r\nDrill, whether or no both Boxes vent the Seed equally. By an Hitch from\r\nthe Plank to the Harrow, the latter may be lifted to a proper Height,\r\nso as not to be in the Way when the Ploughman turns at the Headland.\r\nTwo light Handles on the Plank, like those of the common Plough, would\r\nenable the Person who follows the Drill to keep it from falling off\r\nthe Middle of the Ridge. It may also be useful, in wet Weather, to\r\ndouble the Drills; by which means Two Ridges may be sown at the same\r\ntime, the Horse going between them: For the Planks of Two Drills, each\r\nPlank having one of the Shafts fixed to it, may be joined End for End\r\nby Two flat Bars of Iron, one on each Side, well secured by Iron Pins\r\nand Screws; and, by corresponding Holes in the Planks and Bars, the\r\nDistance between the Drills may be altered, according to the different\r\nSpaces between the Ridges.\r\n\r\nThe Alterations made by the Editors of this Impression are little more\r\nthan omitting the controversial Parts of the Book, which were judged of\r\nno Service to the Reader, as they no-ways affected the Merits of Mr.\r\n_Tull_’s Principles.\r\n\r\nBut as he endeavoured to recommend his Theory by drawing a Comparison\r\nbetween the Old Method of Culture and the New, so we beg leave to annex\r\na Computation of the Expence and Profit of each; for which we are\r\nobliged to a Gentleman, who for some Years practised both in a Country\r\nwhere the Soil was of the same Nature with that from whence Mr. _Tull_\r\ndrew his Observations, _viz._ light and chalky. And we chuse to give\r\nthis the rather, as it comes from one who has no Attachment to Mr.\r\n_Tull_’s Method, farther than that he found it answer in his Trials. We\r\nappeal to Experience, whether every Article in this Calculation is not\r\nestimated in favour of the Common Husbandry; whether the Expence be not\r\nrated lower than most Farmers find it, and the Crop such as they would\r\nrejoice to see, but seldom do, in the Country where this Computation\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nIn the New Husbandry every Article is put at its full Value, and the\r\nCrop of each Year is Four Bushels short of the other; tho’, in several\r\nYears Experience, it has equalled, and generally exceeded, those of the\r\nNeighbourhood in the Old Way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Estimate of the Expence and Profit of Ten Acres of Land in Twenty\r\nYears._\r\n\r\nI. _In the Old Way._\r\n\r\n  First Year, for Wheat, costs 33_l._\r\n  5_s._ _viz._                            _l._ _s._ _d._  _l._ _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  First Plowing, at 6_s._ _per_ Acre        3    0    0\r\n  Second and Third Ditto, at 8_s._ _per_\r\n  Acre                                      4    0    0\r\n  Manure, 30_s._ _per_ Acre                15    0    0\r\n                                           ------------   22    0    0\r\n\r\n  Two Harrowings, and Sowing, at 2_s._\r\n  6_d._ _per_ Acre                          1    5    0\r\n  Seed, three Bushels _per_ Acre, at\r\n  4_s._ _per_ Bush.                         6    0    0\r\n  Weeding, at 2_s._ _per_ Acre              1    0    0\r\n  Reaping, Binding, and Carrying, at        3    0    0\r\n  6_s._ _per_ Acre\r\n                                           ------------   11    5    0\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n                                                          33    5    0\r\n\r\n  Second Year, for Barley, costs 11_l._ 6_s._ 8_d._ _viz._\r\n\r\n  Once Plowing, at 6_s._ _per_ Acre         3    0    0\r\n  Harrowing and Sowing, at 1_s._ 6_d._\r\n  _per_ Acre,                               0   15    0\r\n  Weeding, at 1_s._ _per_ Acre              0   10    0\r\n  Seed, 4 Bushels _per_ Acre, at 2_s._\r\n  _per_ Bushel                              4    0    0\r\n  Cutting, Raking, and Carrying, at 3_s._\r\n  2_d._ _per_ Acre                          1   11    8\r\n  Grass-Seeds, at 3_s._ _per_ Acre          1   10    0\r\n                                           ------------   11    6    8\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n                                                          44   11    8\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n  Third and Fourth Years, lying in Grass, cost nothing:\r\n  So that the Expence of Ten Acres in Four Years comes\r\n  to 44_l._ 11_s._ 8_d._ and in Twenty Years to          222   18    4\r\n\r\n  First Year’s Produce is half a Load of\r\n  Wheat _per_ Acre, at 7_l._               35    0    0\r\n  Second Years Produce is Two Quarters\r\n  of Barley _per_ Acre, at 1_l._           20    0    0\r\n  Third and Fourth Years Grass is valued\r\n  at 1_l._ 10_s._ _per_ Acre               15    0    0\r\n                                           ------------\r\n  So that the Produce of Ten Acres in\r\n  Four Years is                            70    0    0\r\n                                           ------------\r\n  And in Twenty Years it will be                         350    0    0\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n  Deduct the Expence, and there remains clear Profit\r\n  on Ten Acres in 20 Years by the Old Way                127    1    8\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n\r\nII. _In the New Way._\r\n\r\n  First Year’s extraordinary Expence is, for plowing\r\n  and manuring the Land, the same as in Old Way           22    0    0\r\n\r\n  Plowing once more, at 4_s._ _per_ Acre    2    0    0\r\n  Seed, 9 Gallons _per_ Acre, at 4_s._\r\n  _per_ Bushel                              2    5    0\r\n  Drilling, at 7_d._ _per_ Acre             0    5   10\r\n  Hand-hoeing and Weeding, at 2_s._ 6_d._\r\n  _per_ Acre                                1    5    0\r\n  Horse-hoeing Six times, at 10_s._ _per_\r\n  Acre                                      5    0    0\r\n  Reaping, Binding, and Carrying, at 6_s._\r\n  _per_ Acre                                3    0    0\r\n                                           ------------\r\n  The standing annual Charge on Ten Acres\r\n  is                                       13   15   10\r\n                                           ------------\r\n  Therefore the Expence on Ten Acres in Twenty Years is  275   16    8\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n  Add the Extraordinaries of the First Year, and the\r\n  Sum is                                                 297   16    8\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n  The yearly Produce is at least Two Quarters of Wheat\r\n  _per_ Acre, at 1_l._ 8_s._ _per_ Quarter;

and moreover, that tho’ the\r\nCrop of Wheat from the _Drill-plough_ is here put only at Two Quarters\r\non an Acre, yet Mr. _Tull_ himself, by actual Experiment and Measure,\r\nfound the Produce of his drilled Wheat-crop amounted to almost Four\r\nQuarters on an Acre: And, as he has delivered this Fact upon his own\r\nKnowlege, so there is no Reason to doubt of his Veracity, which has\r\nnever yet been called in question. But that we might not be supposed to\r\nhave any Prejudice in favour of his Scheme, we have chosen to take the\r\nCalculations of others rather than his, having no other View in what we\r\nhave said, than to promote the Cause of Truth, and the public Welfare.\r\n\r\n  The Wheat and Turnep Drill-Boxes, or the Drill-Plough complete,\r\n  mentioned in this Treatise, may be had at Mr. _Mulford_’s in\r\n  _Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane, London_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of_ ROOTS _and_ LEAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the most immediate Use of _Agriculture_, in feeding Plants,\r\nrelates to their _Roots_, they ought to be treated of in the first\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\n_Roots_ are very different in different Plants: But ’tis not\r\nnecessary here to take notice of all the nice Distinctions of them;\r\ntherefore I shall only divide them in general into two Sorts, _viz._\r\n_Horizontal-Roots_, and _Tap-Roots_, which may include them all.\r\n\r\nAll have Branchings and Fibres going all manner of ways, ready to fill\r\nthe Earth that is open.\r\n\r\nBut such _Roots_ as I call Horizontal (except of Trees) have seldom any\r\nof their Branchings deeper than the Surface or Staple of the Earth,\r\nthat is commonly mov’d by the Plough or Spade.\r\n\r\nThe Tap-Root commonly runs down Single and Perpendicular[1] reaching\r\nsometimes many Fathoms below.\r\n\r\n  [1] In this manner descends the first Root of every Seed; but of Corn\r\n  very little, if at all, deeper than the Earth is tilled.\r\n\r\n  These first Seed-Roots of Corn die as soon as the other Roots come\r\n  out near the Surface, above the Grain: and therefore this first is\r\n  not called a Tap Root; but yet some of the next Roots that come out\r\n  near the Surface of the Ground, always reach down to the Bottom of\r\n  the pulveriz’d Staple; as may be seen, if you carefully examine it\r\n  in the Spring time; but this first Root in Saint-foin becomes a Tap\r\n  Root.\r\n\r\nThis (tho’ it goes never so deep) has horizontal ones passing out all\r\nround the Sides; and extend to several Yards Distance from it, after\r\nthey are by their Minuteness, and earthly Tincture, become invisible\r\nto the naked Eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Method how to find the Distance to which_ Roots _extend\r\nHorizontally._\r\n\r\n_Pl._ 6. _Fig._ 7. Is a Piece or Plot dug and made fine in whole hard\r\nGround, the End _A_ 2 Feet, the End _B_ 12 Feet, the Length of the\r\nPiece 20 Yards; the Figures in the middle of it are 20 _Turneps_, sown\r\nearly, and well ho’d.\r\n\r\nThe manner of this Hoing must be at first near the Plants, with a\r\nSpade, and each time afterwards, a Foot farther Distance, till all the\r\nEarth be once well dug; and if Weeds appear where it has been so dug,\r\nhoe them out shallow with the Hand-Hoe. But dig all the Piece next the\r\nout Lines deep every time, that it may be the finer for the _Roots_ to\r\nenter, when they are permitted to come thither.\r\n\r\nIf these _Turneps_ are all gradually bigger, as they stand nearer to\r\nthe End _B_, ’tis a Proof they all extend to the Outside of the Piece;\r\nand the _Turnep_ 20 will appear to draw Nourishment from six Feet\r\nDistance from its Centre.\r\n\r\nBut if the _Turneps_ 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, acquire no greater Bulk than\r\nthe _Turnep_ 15, it will be clear, that their _Roots_ extend no farther\r\nthan those of the _Turnep_ 15 does; which is but about 4 Feet.\r\n\r\nBy this Method the Distance of the Extent of _Roots_ of any Plant may\r\nbe discover’d.\r\n\r\nWhat put me upon this Method was an Observation of two Lands (or\r\nRidges) drill’d with _Turneps_ in Rows, a Foot asunder, and very even\r\nin them; the Ground, at both Ends, and one Side, was hard and unplow’d;\r\nthe _Turneps_ not being ho’d, were very poor, small, and yellow, except\r\nthe Three outside Rows, _B_, _C_, _D_, which stood next to the Land (or\r\nRidge) _E_, which Land being plow’d and harrow’d, at the time the Land\r\n_A_ ought to have been ho’d, gave a dark flourishing Colour to these\r\nthree Rows; and the _Turneps_ in the Row _D_, which stood farthest off\r\nfrom the new-plow’d Land _E_, received so much Benefit from it, as to\r\ngrow twice as big as any of the more distant Rows. The Row _C_, being a\r\nFoot nearer to the new-plow’d Land, became twice as large as those in\r\n_D_; but the Row _B_, which was next to the Land _E_, grew much larger\r\nyet[2].\r\n\r\n  [2] A like Observation to this on the Land E, has been made in\r\n  several Turnep Fields of divers Farmers, where Lands adjoining to\r\n  the Turneps have been well tilled; all the Turneps of the contiguous\r\n  Lands that were within three or four Feet, or more, of the newly\r\n  pulveriz’d Earth, received as great, or greater increase, in the\r\n  Manner as my Rows B C D did; and what is yet a greater Proof of the\r\n  Length of Roots, and of the Benefit of deep Hoing, all these Turneps\r\n  have been well Hand-ho’d; which is a good Reason why the Benefit of\r\n  the deep Pulveration should be perceivable at a greater Distance from\r\n  it than mine, because my Turneps, not being hoed at all, had not\r\n  Strength to send out their Roots through so many Feet of unpulveriz’d\r\n  Earth, as these can through their Earth pulveriz’d by the Hoe, tho’\r\n  but shallowly.\r\n\r\n  This Observation, as ’tis related to me (I being unable to go far\r\n  enough to see it myself) sufficiently demonstrates the mighty\r\n  Difference there is between Hand-hoing and Horse-hoing.\r\n\r\n_F_ Plate 6. is a Piece of hard whole Ground, of about two Perch in\r\nLength, and about two or three Feet broad, lying betwixt those two\r\nLands, which had not been plow’d that Year; ’twas remarkable, that\r\nduring the Length of this interjacent hard Ground, the Rows _B_, _C_,\r\n_D_, were as small and yellow as any in the Land.\r\n\r\nThe _Turneps_ in the Row _D_, about three Feet distant from the Land\r\n_E_, receiving a double Increase, proves they had as much Nourishment\r\nfrom the Land _E_, as from the Land _A_, wherein they stood; which\r\nNourishment was brought by less than half the Number of _Roots_ of each\r\nof these _Turneps_.\r\n\r\nIn their own Land they must have extended a Yard all round, else they\r\ncould not have reach’d the Land _E_, wherein ’tis probable these few\r\nRoots went more than another Yard, to give each _Turnep_ as much\r\nIncrease as all the Roots had done in their own Land.\r\n\r\nExcept that it will hereafter appear, that the new Nourishment taken at\r\nthe Extremities of the Roots in the Land _E_, might enable the Plants\r\nto send out more new Roots in their own Land, and receive something\r\nmore from thence.\r\n\r\nThe Row _C_ being twice as big as the Row _D_, must be suppos’d to\r\nextend twice as far; and the Row _B_, four times as far, in proportion\r\nas it was of a Bulk quadruple to the Row _D_.\r\n\r\nA _Turnep_ has a Tap-Root, from whence all these Horizontal Roots are\r\nderiv’d.\r\n\r\nAnd ’tis observable; that betwixt these two Lands there was a Trench,\r\nor Furrow, of about the Depth of nine or ten Inches, where these Roots\r\nmust descend first, and then ascend into the Land _E_: But it must be\r\nnoted, that some small Quantity of Earth was, by the Harrowing, fall’n\r\ninto this Furrow, else the Roots could not have pass’d thro’ it.\r\n\r\n_Roots_ will follow the open Mould[3], by descending perpendicularly,\r\nand mounting again in the same manner: As I have observ’d the Roots\r\nof a Hedge to do, that have pass’d a steep Ditch two Feet deep, and\r\nreach’d the Mould on the other side, and there fill it; and digging\r\nFive Feet distant from the Ditch, found the Roots large, tho’ this\r\nMould was very shallow, and no Roots below the good Mould.\r\n\r\n  [3] A Chalk-Pit, contiguous to a Barn, the Area of which being about\r\n  40 Perch of Ground, was made clean and swept; so that there was not\r\n  the Appearance of any Part of a Vegetable, more than in the Barn’s\r\n  Floor: Straw was thrown from thence into the Pit, for Cattle to lie\r\n  on; the Dung made thereby was haled away about three Years after the\r\n  Pit had been cleansed; when, at the Bottom of it, and upon the Top of\r\n  the Chalk, the Pit was covered all over with Roots, which came from\r\n  a Witch-Elm, not more than Five or Six Yards in Length, from Top to\r\n  Bottom, and which was about Five Yards above, and Eleven Yards from\r\n  the Area of the Pit; so that in three Years the Roots of this Tree\r\n  extended themselves Eight times the Length of the Tree, beyond the\r\n  Extremities of the old Roots, at Eleven Yards Distance from the Body:\r\n  The annual-increased Length of the Roots was near Three times as much\r\n  as the Height of the Tree.\r\n\r\n  I’m told an Objection hath been made from hence against the Growth of\r\n  a Plant’s being in proportion to the Length of its Roots; but when\r\n  the Case is fully stated, the Objection may vanish. This Witch-Elm is\r\n  a very old decay’d Stump, which is here called a _Staggar_, appearing\r\n  by its Crookedness to have been formerly a _Plasher_ in an old\r\n  White-thorn Hedge wherein it stands: It had been lopped many Years\r\n  before that accidental Increase of Roots happened; it was stunted,\r\n  and sent out poor Shoots; but in the third Year of these Roots, its\r\n  Boughs being most of them horizontally inclined, were observed to\r\n  grow vigorously, and the Leaves were broad, and of a flourishing\r\n  Colour; at the End of the third Year all these Roots were taken away,\r\n  and the _Area_ being a Chalk-Rock lying uncovered, round the Place\r\n  where the Single Root, that produced all these, came out of the Bank,\r\n  no more Roots could run out on the bare Chalk, and the Growth of the\r\n  Boughs has been but little since.\r\n\r\n  _Wheat_, drill’d in double Rows in _November_, in a Field well till’d\r\n  before Planting, look’d yellow, when about Eighteen Inches high; at\r\n  Two Feet Distance from the Plants, the Earth was Ho-plow’d, which\r\n  gave such Nourishment to ’em, that they recovered their Health, and\r\n  changed their sickly Yellow, to a lively Green Colour.\r\n\r\nSo in an Orchard, where the Trees are planted too deep, below the\r\nStaple or good Mould, the Roots, at a little Distance from the Stem,\r\nare all as near the upper Superficies of the Ground, as of those Trees,\r\nwhich are planted higher than the Level of the Earth’s Surface.\r\n\r\nBut the Damage of planting a Tree too low in moist Ground is, that in\r\npassing thro’ this low Part, standing in Water, the Sap is chill’d, and\r\nits Circulation thereby retarded.\r\n\r\nOne Cause of Peoples not suspecting Roots to extend to the Twentieth\r\nPart of the Distance which in reality they do, was from observing these\r\nHorizontal-Roots, near the Plant, to be pretty taper; and if they did\r\ndiminish on, in proportion to what they do there, they must soon come\r\nto an End. But the Truth is, that after a few Inches, they are not\r\ndiscernibly taper, but pass on to their Ends very nearly of the same\r\nBigness; this may be seen in _Roots_ growing in Water, and in some\r\nother, tho’ with much Care and Difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn pulling up the aforemention’d _Turneps_, their Roots seem’d to end\r\nat few Inches Distance from the Plants, they being, farther off, too\r\nfine to be perceiv’d by ordinary Observation.\r\n\r\nI found an extreme small Fibre on the Side of a _Carrot_, much less\r\nthan a Hair; but thro’ a Microscope it appear’d a large Root, not\r\ntaper, but broken off short at the End, which it is probable might have\r\n(before broken off) extended near as far as the _Turnep_ Roots did.\r\nIt had many Fibres going out of it, and I have seen that a _Carrot_\r\nwill draw Nourishment from a great Distance, tho’ the Roots are almost\r\ninvisible, where they come out of the _Carrot_ itself.\r\n\r\nBy the Piece _F_ Plate 6. may be seen, that those Roots cannot\r\npenetrate, unless the Land be open’d by Tillage, _&c._\r\n\r\nAs Animals of different Species have their Guts bearing different\r\nProportions to the Length of their Bodies; so ’tis probable, different\r\nSpecies of Plants may have their Roots as different. But if those which\r\nhave shorter Roots have more in Number, and having set down the means\r\nhow to know the Length of them in the Earth, I leave the different\r\nLengths of different Species to be examin’d by those who will take the\r\nPains of more Trials. This is enough for me, that there is no Plant\r\ncommonly propagated, but what will send out its Roots far enough, to\r\nhave the Benefit of all the ho’d Spaces or Intervals I in the following\r\nChapters allot them, even tho’ they should not have Roots so long as\r\ntheir Stalks or Stems.\r\n\r\nAnd this great Length of Roots will appear very reasonable, if we\r\ncompare the Largeness of the Leaves (which are the Parts ordain’d for\r\nExcretion) with the Smalness of the Capillary Roots, which must make\r\nup in Length or Number what they want in Bigness, being destin’d to\r\nrange far in the Earth, to find out a Supply of Matter to maintain\r\nthe whole Plant; whereas the chief Office of the Stalks and Leaves is\r\nonly to receive the same, and to discharge into the Atmosphere such\r\nPart thereof as is found unfit for Nutrition; a much easier Task than\r\nthe other, and consequently fewer Passages suffice, these ending in an\r\nobtuse Form; for otherwise the Air would not be able to sustain the\r\nStalks and Leaves in their upright Posture: but the Roots, tho’ very\r\nweak and slender, are easily supported by the Earth, notwithstanding\r\ntheir Length, Smalness, and Flexibility.\r\n\r\nPlants have no Stomach, nor _Oesophagus_, which are necessary to\r\nconvey the Mass of Food to an Animal: Which Mass, being exhausted by\r\nthe Lacteals, is eliminated by way of Excrements, but the Earth itself\r\nbeing that Mass to the Guts (or Roots) of Plants, they have only fine\r\nRecrements, which are thrown off by the Leaves.\r\n\r\nIn this, Animal and Vegetable Bodies agree, that Guts and Roots are\r\nboth injured by the open Air; and Nature has taken an equal Care, that\r\nboth may be supply’d with Nourishment, without being expos’d to it.\r\nGuts are supply’d from their Insides, and Roots from their Outsides.\r\n\r\nAll the Nutriment (or _Pabulum_) which Guts receive for the Use of\r\nan Animal, is brought to them; but Roots must search out and fetch\r\nthemselves all the _Pabulum_ of a Plant; therefore a greater Quantity\r\nof Roots, in Length or Number, is necessary to a Plant, than of Guts to\r\nan Animal.\r\n\r\nAll _Roots_ are as the Intestines of Animals, and have their Mouths or\r\nLacteal Vessels opening on their outer spongy Superficies, as the Guts\r\nof Animals have theirs opening in their inner spongy Superficies.\r\n\r\nThe Animal Lacteals take in their Food by the Pressure that is made\r\nfrom the Peristaltic Motion, and that Motion caus’d by the Action\r\nof Respiration, both which Motions press the Mouths of the Lacteals\r\nagainst the Mass or Soil which is within the Guts, and bring them into\r\ncloser Contact with it.\r\n\r\nBoth these Motions are supply’d in Roots by the Pressure occasion’d\r\nby the Increase of their Diameters in the Earth, which presses their\r\nLacteal Mouths against the Soil without. But in such Roots as live in\r\nWater, a Pressure is constantly made against the Roots by the Weight\r\nand Fluidity of the Water; this presses such fine Particles of Earth it\r\ncontains, and which come into Contact with their Mouths, the closer to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd when _Roots_ are in a till’d Soil, a great Pressure is made against\r\nthem by the Earth, which constantly subsides, and presses their Food\r\ncloser and closer, even into their Mouths; until itself becomes so hard\r\nand close, that the weak Sorts of Roots can penetrate no farther into\r\nit, unless re-open’d by new Tillage, which is call’d Hoing.\r\n\r\nWhen a good Number of Single-Mint Stalks had stood in Water, until they\r\nwere well stock’d with Roots from their two lower Joints, and some of\r\nthem from three Joints, I set one in a Mint-Glass full of Salt Water;\r\nthis Mint became perfectly dead within three Days.\r\n\r\nAnother Mint I put into a Glass of fair Water; but I immers’d one\r\nString of its Roots (being brought over the Top of that Glass into\r\nanother Glass of Salt-water, contiguous to the Top of the other Glass:\r\nThis _Mint_ dy’d also very soon.\r\n\r\nOf another (standing in a Glass of Water and Earth till it grew\r\nvigorously) I ty’d one single Root into a Bag, which held a Spoonful\r\nof dry Salt, adjoining to the Top of the Glass, which kill’d this\r\nstrong Mint also. I found that this Salt was soon dissolv’d, tho’ on\r\nthe Outside of the Glass; and tho’ no Water reach’d so high, as to be\r\nwithin Two Inches of the Joint which produc’d this Root: The Leaves of\r\nall these were salt as Brine to the Taste.\r\n\r\nOf another, I put an upper Root into a small Glass of Ink, instead of a\r\nBag of Salt, in the Manner above-mention’d; this Plant was also kill’d\r\nby some of the Ink Ingredients. The Blackness was not communicated to\r\nthe Stalk, or Leaves, which inclin’d rather to a yellowish Colour as\r\nthey died, which seem’d owing to the _Copperas_.\r\n\r\nI made a very strong Liquor with Water, and bruised Seeds of\r\n_Wild-Garlick_, and, filling a Glass therewith, plac’d the Top of it\r\nclose to the Top of another Glass, having in it a Mint, two or three of\r\nwhose upper Roots, put into this stinking Liquor, full of the bruised\r\nSeeds, and there remaining, it kill’d the Mint in some time; but it\r\nwas much longer in dying than the others were with Salt and Ink. It\r\nmight be, because these Roots in the _Garlick_ were very small, and did\r\nnot bear so great a Proportion to their whole System of Roots, as the\r\nRoots, by which the other Mints were poison’d, did to theirs.\r\n\r\nWhen the Edges of the Leaves began to change Colour, I chew’d many of\r\nthem in my Mouth, and found at first the strong aromatic Flavour of\r\nMint, but that was soon over; and then the nauseous Taste of _Garlick_\r\nwas very perceptible to my Palate.\r\n\r\nI observ’d, that when the _Mint_ had stood in a Glass of Water, until\r\nit seem’d to have finish’d its Growth, the Roots being about a Foot\r\nlong, and of an earthy Colour, after putting in some fine Earth, which\r\nsunk down to the Bottom, there came from the upper Joint a new Set of\r\nwhite Roots, taking their Course on the Outside of the Heap of old\r\nRoots downwards, until they reach’d the Earth at the Bottom; and then,\r\nafter some time, came to be of the same earthy Colour with the old\r\nones.\r\n\r\nAnother _Mint_ being well rooted from Two Joints, about Four Inches\r\nasunder; I plac’d the Roots of the lower Joint in a deep Mint-Glass,\r\nhaving Water at the Bottom, and the Roots of the upper Joint into a\r\nsquare Box, contriv’d for the Purpose, standing over the Glass, and\r\nhaving a Bottom, that open’d in the Middle, with a Hole, that shut\r\ntogether close to the Stalk, just below the upper Joint; then laying\r\nall these upper Roots to one Corner of the Box, I fill’d it with Sand,\r\ndry’d in a Fire-shovel, and found, that in one Night’s time, the Roots\r\nof the lower Joint, which reach’d the Water at the Bottom of the Glass,\r\nhad drawn it up, and imparted so much thereof to those Roots in the Box\r\nabove, that the Sand, at that Corner where they lay, was very wet, and\r\nthe other three Corners dry. This Experiment I repeated very often, and\r\nit always succeeded as that did.\r\n\r\nAnd for the same Purpose I prepar’d a small Trough, about two Foot\r\nlong, and plac’d a Mint-Glass under each End of the Trough; over each\r\nGlass I plac’d a Mint, with half its Roots in the Glass, the other\r\nhalf in the Trough: The Mints stood just upon the Ends of the Trough.\r\nThen I cover’d these Roots with pulveriz’d Earth, and kept the Glasses\r\nsupply’d with Water; and as oft as the white fibrous Roots shot thro’\r\nthe Earth, I threw on more Earth, till the Trough would hold no more;\r\nand still the white Fibres came thro’, and appear’d above it; but all\r\nseem’d (as I saw by the Help of a coarse Microscope) to turn, and when\r\nthey came above-ground, their Ends enter’d into it again. These two\r\n_Mints_ grew thrice as large as any other _Mint_ I had, which were\r\nmany, that stood in Water, and much larger than those which stood in\r\nWater with Earth in it: They being all of an equal Bigness when set in,\r\nand set at the same time. Tho’ these two, standing in my Chamber, never\r\nhad any Water in their Earth, but what those Roots, which reach’d the\r\nWater in the Glasses, sent up to the Roots, which grew in the Trough.\r\nThe vast Quantity of Water these Roots sent up, being sufficient to\r\nkeep all the Earth in the Troughs moist, tho’ of a thousand times\r\ngreater Quantity than the Roots which water’d it, makes it probable,\r\nthat the Water pass’d out of the Roots into the Earth, without mixing\r\nat all with the Sap, or being alter’d to any Degree. The Earth kept\r\nalways moist, and in the hot Weather there would not remain a Drop of\r\nWater in the Glasses, when they had not been fresh supply’d in two Days\r\nand one Night; and yet these Roots in the Glasses were not dry’d, tho’\r\nthey stood sometimes a whole Day and Night thus in the empty Glasses.\r\nThese two Mints have thus liv’d all one Summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the_ Mints, _&c._\r\n\r\nTho’ the Vessels of Marine Plants be some ways fortify’d against the\r\nAcrimony of Salt, as Sea-fish are, yet the Mints all shew, that Salt is\r\npoison to other Plants.\r\n\r\nThe Reason why the Salts in Dung, Brine, or Urine, do not kill Plants\r\nin the Field or Garden, is, that their Force is spent in acting upon,\r\nand dividing the Parts of Earth; neither do these Salts, or at least\r\nany considerable Quantity of them, reach the Roots.\r\n\r\nI try’d Salt to many Potatoes in the Ground being undermin’d, and a few\r\nof their Roots put into a Dish of Salt-water, they all died sooner or\r\nlater, according to their Bigness, and to the Proportions the Quantity\r\nof Salt apply’d did bear to them.\r\n\r\nBy the Mints it appears, that Roots make no Distinctions in the Liquor\r\nthey imbibe, whether it be for their Nourishment or Destruction; and\r\nthat they do not insume what is disagreeable, or Poison to them, for\r\nlack of other Sustenance; since they were very vigorous, and well fed\r\nin the Glasses, at the time when the most inconsiderable Part of their\r\nNumber had the Salt, Garlick, and Ink offer’d to them.\r\n\r\nThe sixth _Mint_ shews, that when new Earth is apply’d to the old\r\nRoots, a Plant sends out new Roots on Purpose to feed on it: And that\r\nthe more Earth is given it, the more Roots will be form’d, by the new\r\nVigour the Plant takes from the Addition of Earth. This corresponds\r\nwith the Action of Hoing; for every time the Earth is mov’d about\r\nRoots, they have a Change of Earth, which is new to them.\r\n\r\nThe seventh _Mint_ proves, that there is such a Communication betwixt\r\nall the Roots, that when any of them have Water, they do impart a Share\r\nthereof to all the rest: And that the Root of the lower Joint of this\r\nMint had Passages (or Vessels) leading from them, through the Stalk, to\r\nthe Roots of the upper Joint; tho’ the clear Stalk (through which it\r\nmust have pass’d) that was betwixt these two Joints, was several Inches\r\nin Length.\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the great Produce of long tap-rooted Plants, such as\r\n_Lusern_ and _St. Foin_, in very dry Weather: for the Earth at a great\r\nDepth is always moist. It accounts also for the good Crops we have in\r\ndry Summers, upon Land that has a Clay Bottom; for there the Water is\r\nretain’d a long time, and the lower Roots of Plants which reach it, do,\r\nlike those of this Mint, send up a Share to all the higher Roots.\r\n\r\nIf those Roots of a Plant, which lie at the Surface of the Ground, did\r\nnot receive Moisture from other Roots, which lie deeper, they could be\r\nof no Use in dry Weather. But ’tis certain, that if this dry Surface be\r\nmov’d or dung’d, the Plant will be found to grow the faster, tho’ no\r\nRain falls; which seems to prove, both that the deep Roots communicate\r\nto the shallow a Share of their Water, and receive in Return from them\r\na Share of Food, in common with all the rest of the Plant, as in the\r\nMints they did.\r\n\r\nThe two last _Mints_ shew, that when the upper Roots have Moisture\r\n(as they had in the Earth in the Trough, carried thither first by the\r\nlower Roots) they impart some of it to the lower, else these could not\r\nhave continu’d plump and fresh, as they did for 24 Hours in the empty\r\nGlass. And I have since observed them to do so, in the cooler Season\r\nof the Year, for several Weeks together, without any other Water, than\r\nwhat the upper Roots convey’d to them, from the moist Earth above in\r\nthe Trough[4]. I know not what Time these Roots might continue to be\r\nsupply’d thus in the hot Weather, because I did not try any longer, for\r\nfear of killing them.\r\n\r\n  [4] ’Tis certain, that Roots and other Chyle Vessels of a Plant have\r\n  a free Communication throughout all their Cavities, and the Liquor in\r\n  them will run towards that Part where there is least Resistance; and\r\n  such is that which is the most empty, whether it be above or below;\r\n  for there are no _Valves_ that can hinder the Descent or Ascent of\r\n  Liquor in these Vessels, as appears by the growing of a Plant in an\r\n  inverted Posture.\r\n\r\nBut it must be noted, that the Depth of the Glass protected the Roots\r\ntherein from the Injury of the Motion of the free Air, which would have\r\ndry’d them, if they had been out of the Glass.\r\n\r\nIn this Trough is shewn most of the Hoing Effects; _viz._ That Roots,\r\nby being broken off near the Ends, increase their Number, and send out\r\nseveral where one is broken off.\r\n\r\nThat the Roots increase their Fibres every time the Earth is stirr’d\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nThat the stirring the Earth makes the Plants grow the faster.\r\n\r\nLEAVES are the Parts or Bowels of a Plant, which perform the same\r\nOffice to Sap, as the Lungs of an Animal do to Blood; that is, they\r\npurify or cleanse it of the Recrements, or fuliginous Steams, received\r\nin the Circulation, being the unfit Parts of the Food; and perhaps some\r\ndecay’d Particles, which fly off the Vessels, through which Blood and\r\nSap do pass respectively.\r\n\r\nBesides which Use, the Nitro-aerous Particles may there enter, to keep\r\nup the vital Ferment or Flame.\r\n\r\nMr. _Papin_ shews, that Air will pass in at the Leaves, and out thro’\r\nthe Plant at the Roots, but Water will not pass in at the Leaves; and\r\nthat if the Leaves have no Air, a Plant will die; but if the Leaves\r\nhave Air, tho’ the Root remain in Water _in vacuo_, the Plant will live\r\nand grow.\r\n\r\nDr. _Grew_, in his Anatomy of Plants, mentions Vessels, which he calls,\r\nNet-work, Cobweb, Skeins of Silk, _&c._ but above all, the Multitude\r\nof Air-Bladders in them, which I take to be of the same Use in Leaves,\r\nas the Vesiculæ are in Lungs. Leaves being as Lungs inverted, and of\r\na broad and thin Form; their Vesiculæ are in Contact with the free\r\nopen Air, and therefore have no need of Trachea, or Bronchia, nor of\r\nRespiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of_ FOOD _of_ PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief Art of an Husbandman is to feed Plants to the best Advantage;\r\nbut how shall he do that, unless he knows what is their Food? By Food\r\nis meant that Matter, which, being added and united to the first\r\n_Stamina_ of Plants, or _Plantulæ_, which were made in little at the\r\nCreation, gives them, or rather is their Increase.\r\n\r\n’Tis agreed, that all the following Materials contribute, in some\r\nmanner, to the Increase of Plants; but ’tis disputed which of them\r\nis that very Increase or Food. 1. _Nitre_. 2. _Water_. 3. _Air_. 4.\r\n_Fire_. 5. _Earth_.\r\n\r\nI will not mention, as a Food, that acid Spirit of the Air, so much\r\ntalk’d of; since by its eating asunder Iron Bars it appears too much of\r\nthe Nature of _Aqua Fortis_, to be a welcome Guest alone to the tender\r\nVessels of the Roots of Plants.\r\n\r\n_Nitre_ is useful to divide and prepare the Food, and may be said to\r\nnourish Vegetables in much the same Manner as my Knife nourishes me, by\r\ncutting and dividing my Meat: But when _Nitre_ is apply’d to the Root\r\nof a Plant, it will kill it as certainly as a Knife misapply’d will\r\nkill a Man: Which proves, that _Nitre_ is, in respect of Nourishment,\r\njust as much the Food of Plants, as _White Arsenick_ is the Food of\r\nRats. And the same may be said of Salts.\r\n\r\n_Water_, from _Van-Helmont_’s Experiment, was by some great\r\nPhilosophers thought to be it. But these were deceived, in not\r\nobserving, that Water has always in its Intervals a Charge of Earth,\r\nfrom which no Art can free it. This Hypothesis having been fully\r\nconfuted by Dr. _Woodward_, no body has, that I know of, maintain’d it\r\nsince: And to the Doctor’s Arguments I shall add more in the Article of\r\nAir.\r\n\r\n_Air_, because its Spring, _&c._ is as necessary to the Life of\r\nVegetables, as the Vehicle of Water is; some modern Virtuosi have\r\naffirm’d, from the same and worse Arguments than those of the\r\nWater-Philosophers, that Air is the Food of Plants. Mr. _Bradley_ being\r\nthe chief, if not only Author, who has publish’d this Phantasy, which\r\nat present seems to get Ground, ’tis fit he should be answer’d: And\r\nthis will be easily done, if I can shew, that he has answer’d this his\r\nown Opinion, by some or all of his own Arguments.\r\n\r\nHis first is, that of _Helmont_, and is thus related in Mr. _Bradley_’s\r\ngeneral Treatise of _Husbandry and Gardening_, Vol. I. _p._ 36. ‘Who\r\ndry’d Two hundred Pounds of Earth, and planted a Willow of Five Pounds\r\nWeight in it, which he water’d with Rain, or distill’d Water; and\r\nto secure it from any other Earth getting in, he covered it with a\r\nperforated Tin Cover. Five Years after, weighing the Tree, with all\r\nthe Leaves it had borne in that Time, he found it to weigh One hundred\r\nSixty-nine Pounds Three Ounces; but the Earth was only diminish’d about\r\ntwo Ounces in its Weight.’\r\n\r\nOn this Experiment Mr. _Bradley_ grounds his Airy Hypothesis. But let\r\nit be but examined fairly, and see what may be thence inferr’d.\r\n\r\nThe Tin Cover was to prevent any other Earth from getting in. This must\r\nalso prevent any Earth from getting out, except what enter’d the Roots,\r\nand by them pass’d into the Tree.\r\n\r\nA Willow is a very thirsty Tree, and must have drank in Five Years time\r\nseveral Tuns of Water, which must necessarily carry in its Interstices\r\na great Quantity of Earth (probably many times more than the Tree’s[5]\r\nWeight, which could not get out, but by the Roots of the Willow.\r\n\r\n  [5] The Body of an Animal receives a much less Increase in Weight\r\n  than its Perspirations amount to, as _Sanctorius_’s _Static-Chair_\r\n  demonstrates.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Two hundred Pounds of Earth not being increased, proves\r\nthat so much Earth as was poured in with the Water, did enter the Tree.\r\n\r\nWhether the Earth did enter to nourish the Tree, or whether only in\r\norder to pass through it (by way of Vehicle to the Air), and leave the\r\nAir behind for the Augment of the Willow, may appear by examining the\r\nMatter of which the Tree did consist.\r\n\r\nIf the Matter remaining after the Corruption or Putrefaction of the\r\nTree be Earth, will it not be a Proof, that the Earth remained in it,\r\nto nourish and augment it? for it could not leave what it did not\r\nfirst take, nor be augmented by what pass’d through it. According to\r\n_Aristotle_’s Doctrine, and Mr. _Bradley_’s too, in Vol. I. _pag._ 72.\r\n“Putrefaction resolves it again into Earth, its first Principle.”\r\n\r\nThe Weight of the Tree, even when green, must consist of Earth and\r\nWater. Air could be no Part of it, because Air being of no greater\r\nspecific Gravity than the incumbent Atmosphere, could not be of any\r\nWeight in it; therefore was no Part of the One hundred Sixty-nine\r\nPounds Three Ounces.\r\n\r\nNature has directed Animals and Vegetables to seek what is most\r\nnecessary to them. At the Time when the _Fœtus_ has a Necessity of\r\nRespiration, ’tis brought forth into the open Air, and then the\r\nLungs are filled with Air. As soon as a Calf, Lamb, _&c._ is able\r\nto stand, it applies to the Teat for Food, without any Teaching. In\r\nlike manner Mr. _Bradley_ remarks, in his Vol. I. _pag._ 10. ‘That\r\nalmost every Stem and every Root are formed in a bending manner under\r\nGround; and yet all these Stems become strait and upright when they\r\ncome above-ground, and meet the Air; and most Roots run as directly\r\ndownwards, and shun the Air as much as possible.’\r\n\r\nCan any thing more plainly shew the Intent of Nature, than this his\r\nRemark does? _viz._ That the Air is most necessary to the Tree above\r\nground, to purify the Sap by the Leaves, as the Blood of Animals is\r\ndepurated by their Lungs: And that Roots seek the Earth for their Food,\r\nand shun the Air, which would dry up and destroy them.\r\n\r\nNo one Truth can possibly contradict or interfere with any other Truth;\r\nbut one Error may contradict and interfere with another Error, _viz._\r\n\r\nMr. _Bradley_, and all Authors, I think, are of Opinion, that Plants\r\nof different Natures are fed by a different Sort of Nourishment; from\r\nwhence they aver, that a Crop of Wheat takes up all that is peculiar\r\nto that Grain; then a Crop of Barley all that is proper to it; next a\r\nCrop of Pease, and so on, ’till each has drawn off all those Particles\r\nwhich are proper to it; and then no more of these Grains will grow in\r\nthat Land, till by Fallow, Dung, and Influences of the Heavens, the\r\nEarth will be again replenish’d with new Nourishment, to supply the\r\nsame Sorts of Corn over again. This, if true (as they all affirm it\r\nto be), would prove, that the Air is not the Food of Vegetables. For\r\nthe Air being in itself so homogeneous as it is, could never afford\r\nsuch different Matter as they imagine; neither is it probable, that\r\nthe Air should afford the Wheat Nourishment more one Year, than the\r\nensuing Year; or that the same Year it should nourish Barley in one\r\nField, Wheat in another, Pease in a Third; but that if Barley were\r\nsown in the Third, Wheat in the First, Pease in the Second, all would\r\nfail: Therefore this Hypothesis of Air for Food interferes with, and\r\ncontradicts this Doctrine of Necessity of changing Sorts.\r\n\r\nI suppose, by Air, they do not mean dry Particles of Earth, and the\r\nEffluvia which float in the Air: The Quantity of these is too small to\r\naugment Vegetables to that Bulk they arrive at. By that way of speaking\r\nthey might more truly affirm this of Water, because it must be like\r\nto carry a greater Quantity of Earth than Air doth, in proportion to\r\nthe Difference of their different specific Weight; Water, being about\r\n800 times heavier than Air, is likely to have 800 times more of that\r\nterrestrial Matter in it; and we see this is sufficient to maintain\r\nsome Sort of Vegetables, as Aquatics; but the Air, by its Charge of\r\nEffluvia, _&c._ is never able to maintain or nourish any Plant; for\r\nas to the Sedums, Aloes, and all others, that are supposed to grow\r\nsuspended in the Air, ’tis a mere Fallacy; they seem to grow, but do\r\nnot; since they constantly grow lighter; and tho’ their Vessels may\r\nbe somewhat distended by the Ferment of their own Juices which they\r\nreceived in the Earth, yet suspended in Air, they continually diminish\r\nin Weight (which is the true Argument of a Plant) until they grow to\r\nnothing. So that this Instance of Sedums, _&c._ which they pretend to\r\nbring for Proof of this their Hypothesis, is alone a full Confutation\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nYet if granted, that Air could nourish some Vegetables by the earthy\r\nEffluvia, _&c._ which it carry’d with it [6]; even that would be\r\nagainst them, not for them.\r\n\r\n  [6] This is meant of dry Earth, by its Lightness (when pulveriz’d\r\n  extremely fine) carried in the Air without Vapour: For the\r\n  Atmosphere, consisting of all the Elements, has Earth in it in\r\n  considerable Quantity, mix’d with Water; but a very little Earth is\r\n  so minutely divided, as to fly therein pure from Water, which is its\r\n  Vehicle there for the most Part.\r\n\r\nThey might as well believe, that _Martins_ and _Swallows_ are nourish’d\r\nby the Air, because they live on Flies and Gnats, which they catch\r\ntherein; this being the same Food, which is found in the Stomach of the\r\nChameleon.\r\n\r\nIf, as they say, the Earth is of little other Use to Plants, but to\r\nkeep them fix’d and steady, there would be little or no Difference in\r\nthe Value of rich and poor Land, dung’d or undung’d; for one would\r\nserve to keep Plants fix’d and steady, very near, if not quite as well\r\nas the other.\r\n\r\nIf Water or Air was the Food of Plants, I cannot see what Necessity\r\nthere should be of Dung or Tillage.\r\n\r\n4. _Fire_. No Plant can live without Heat, tho’ different Degrees of it\r\nbe necessary to different Sorts of Plants. Some are almost able to keep\r\nCompany with the _Salamander_, and do live in the hottest Exposures of\r\nthe hot Countries. Others have their Abode with Fishes under Water, in\r\ncold Climates: for the Sun has his Influence, tho’ weaker, upon the\r\nEarth cover’d with Water, at a considerable Depth; which appears by the\r\nEffect the Vicissitudes of Winter and Summer have upon subterraqueous\r\nVegetables.\r\n\r\nTho’ every Heat is said to be a different Degree of Fire; yet we may\r\ndistinguish the Degrees by their different Effects. Heat warms; but\r\nFire burns: The first helps to cherish, the latter destroys Plants.\r\n\r\n5. _Earth_. That which nourishes and augments a Plant is the true Food\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nEvery Plant is Earth, and the Growth and true Increase of a Plant is\r\nthe Addition of more Earth.\r\n\r\n_Nitre_ (or other Salts) prepares the Earth, Water and Air move it, by\r\nconveying and fermenting it in the Juices; and this Motion is called\r\nHeat.\r\n\r\nWhen this additional Earth is assimilated to the Plant, it becomes an\r\nabsolute Part of it.\r\n\r\nSuppose Water, Air, and Heat, could be taken away, would it not remain\r\nto be a Plant, tho’ a dead one?\r\n\r\nBut suppose the Earth of it taken away, what would then become of the\r\nPlant? Mr. _Bradley_ might look long enough after it, before he found\r\nit in the Air among his specific or certain Qualities.\r\n\r\nBesides, too much _Nitre_ (or other Salts) corrodes a Plant; too much\r\nWater drowns it; too much Air dries the Roots of it; too much Heat (or\r\nFire) burns it; but too much Earth a Plant never can have, unless it be\r\ntherein wholly buried; and in that Case it would be equally misapply’d\r\nto the Body, as Air or Nitre would be to the Roots.\r\n\r\nToo much Earth, or too fine, can never possibly be given to Roots; for\r\nthey never receive so much of it as to surfeit the Plants, unless it be\r\ndepriv’d of Leaves, which, as Lungs, should purify it.\r\n\r\nAnd Earth is so surely the Food of all Plants, that with the proper\r\nShare of the other Elements, which each Species of Plants requires, I\r\ndo not find but that any common Earth will nourish any Plant.\r\n\r\nThe only Difference of Soil[7] (except the Richness) seems to be the\r\ndifferent Heat and Moisture it has; for if those be rightly adjusted,\r\nany Soil will nourish any Sort of Plant; for let _Thyme_ and _Rushes_\r\nchange Places, and both will die; but let them change their Soil, by\r\nremoving the Earth wherein the _Thyme_ grew, from the dry Hill down\r\ninto the watry Bottom, and plant _Rushes_ therein; and carry the moist\r\nEarth, wherein the _Rushes_ grew, up to the Hill; and there _Thyme_\r\nwill grow in the Earth that was taken from the _Rushes_; and so will\r\nthe _Rushes_ grow in the Earth that was taken from the _Thyme_; so that\r\n’tis only more or less Water that makes the same Earth fit either for\r\nthe Growth of _Thyme_ or _Rushes_.\r\n\r\n  [7] As I have said in my _Essay_, That _a Soil being once proper to a\r\n  Species of Vegetables, it will always continue to be so_; it must be\r\n  supposed, that there be no Alteration of the _Heat_ and _Moisture_ of\r\n  it; and that this Difference I mean, is of its Quality of nourishing\r\n  different Species of Vegetables, not of the Quantity of it; which\r\n  Quantity may be alter’d by Diminution or Superinduction.\r\n\r\nSo for Heat; our Earth, when it has in the Stove the just Degree of\r\nHeat that each Sort of Plants requires, will maintain Plants brought\r\nfrom both the _Indies_.\r\n\r\nPlants differ as much from one another in the Degrees of Heat and\r\nMoisture they require, as a Fish differs from a Salamander.\r\n\r\nIndeed _Misletoe_, and some other Plants, will not live upon Earth,\r\nuntil it be first alter’d by the Vessels of another Plant or Tree, upon\r\nwhich they grow, and therein are as nice in Food as an Animal.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to have Recourse to Transmutation; for whether Air or\r\nWater, or both, are transform’d into Earth or not, the thing is the\r\nsame, if it be Earth when the Roots take it; and we are convinced that\r\nneither Air nor Water alone, as such, will maintain Plants.\r\n\r\nThese kind of Metamorphoses may properly enough be consider’d in\r\nDissertations purely concerning Matter, and to discover what the\r\ncomponent Particles of Earth are; but not at all necessary to be known,\r\nin relation to the maintaining of Vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of_ PASTURE _of_ PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCattle feed on Vegetables that grow upon the Earth’s external Surface;\r\nbut Vegetables themselves first receive, from within the Earth, the\r\nNourishment they give to Animals.\r\n\r\nThe Pasture of Cattle has been known and understood in all Ages of\r\nthe World, it being liable to Inspection; but the Pasture of Plants,\r\nbeing out of the Observation of the Senses, is only to be known\r\nby Disquisitions of Reason; and has (for ought I can find) pass’d\r\nundiscover’d by the Writers of Husbandry[8].\r\n\r\n  [8] When Writers of Husbandry, in discoursing of Earth and\r\n  Vegetation, come nearest to the Thing, that is, the _Pasture_\r\n  of _Plants_, they are lost in the Shadow of it, and wander in a\r\n  Wilderness of obscure Expressions, such as _Magnetism, Virtue, Power,\r\n  Specific Quality, Certain Quality_, and the like; wherein there is no\r\n  manner of Light for discovering the real Substance, but we are left\r\n  by them more in the Dark to find it, than Roots are when they feed on\r\n  it: And when a Man, no less sagacious than Mr. _Evelyn_, has trac’d\r\n  it thro’ all the _Mazes_ of the _Occult Qualities_, and even up to\r\n  the _Metaphysics_, he declares he cannot determine, whether the Thing\r\n  he pursues be _Corporeal_ or _Spiritual_.\r\n\r\nThe Ignorance of this seems to be one principal Cause, that\r\nAgriculture, the most necessary of all Arts, has been treated of by\r\nAuthors more superficially than any other Art whatever. The Food or\r\n_Pabulum_ of Plants being prov’d to be Earth, where and whence[9] they\r\ntake that, may properly be called their Pasture.\r\n\r\n  [9] By the _Pasture_ is not meant the _Pabulum_ itself; but the\r\n  _Superficies_ from whence the _Pabulum_ is taken by Roots.\r\n\r\nThis Pasture I shall endeavour to describe.\r\n\r\n’Tis the inner or (internal) Superficies[10] of the Earth; or which\r\nis the same thing, ’tis the Superficies of the Pores, Cavities, or\r\nInterstices of the divided Parts of the Earth, which are of two Sorts,\r\nviz. _Natural_ and _Artificial_.\r\n\r\n  [10] This Pasture of Plants never having been mentioned or described\r\n  by any Author that I know of, I am at a loss to find any other Term\r\n  to describe it by, that may be synonymous, or equipollent to it:\r\n  Therefore, for want of a better, I call it the inner, or internal\r\n  Superficies of the Earth, to distinguish it from the outer or\r\n  external Superficies, or Surface, whereon we tread.\r\n\r\n  Inner or internal Superficies may be thought an absurd Expression,\r\n  the Adjective expressing something within, and the Substantive\r\n  seeming to express only what is without it; and indeed the Sense of\r\n  the Expression is so; for the Vegetable Pasture is within the Earth,\r\n  but without (or on the Outsides of) the divided Parts of the Earth.\r\n\r\n  And, besides, Superficies must be joined with the Adjective Inner (or\r\n  Internal) when ’tis used to describe the Inside of a thing that is\r\n  hollow, as the Pores and Interstices of the Earth are.\r\n\r\n  The Superficies, which is the Pasture of Plants, is not a bare\r\n  Mathematical Superficies; for that is only imaginary.\r\n\r\nBy Nature, the whole Earth (or Soil) is composed of Parts; and,\r\nif these had been in every Place absolutely joined, it would have\r\nbeen without Interstices or Pores, and would have had no internal\r\nSuperficies, or Pasture for Plants: but since it is not so strictly\r\ndense[11], there must be Interstices at all those Places where the\r\nParts remain separate and divided.\r\n\r\n  [11] For were the Soil as dense as Glass, the Roots or Vegetables\r\n  (such as our Earth produces) would never be able to enter its Pores.\r\n\r\nThese Interstices, by their Number and Largeness, determine the\r\nspecific Gravity (or true Quantity) of every Soil: The larger they are,\r\nthe lighter is the Soil; and the inner Superficies is commonly the less.\r\n\r\nThe Mouths, or Lacteals, being situate, and opening, in the convex\r\nSuperficies of Roots, they take their _Pabulum_, being fine Particles\r\nof Earth, from the Superficies of the Pores, or Cavities, wherein the\r\nRoots are included.\r\n\r\nAnd ’tis certain, that the Earth is not divested or robb’d of this\r\n_Pabulum_, by any other Means, than by actual Fire, or the Roots of\r\nPlants.\r\n\r\nFor, when no Vegetables are suffer’d to grow in a Soil, it will always\r\ngrow richer. Plow it, harrow it, as often as you please, expose it to\r\nthe Sun in Horse-Paths all the Summer, and to the Frost of the Winter;\r\nlet it be cover’d by Water at the Bottom of Ponds, or Ditches; or if\r\nyou grind dry Earth to Powder, the longer ’tis kept exposed, or treated\r\nby these or any other Method possible (except actual Burning by Fire);\r\ninstead of losing, it will gain the more Fertility.\r\n\r\nThese Particles, which are the _Pabulum_ of Plants, are so very\r\nminute[12] and light, as not to be singly attracted to the Earth, if\r\nseparated from those Parts to which they adhere[13], or with which\r\nthey are in Contact (like Dust to a Looking-Glass, turn it upwards, or\r\ndownwards, it will remain affixt to it), as these Particles do to those\r\nParts, until from thence remov’d by some Agent.\r\n\r\n  [12] As to the Fineness of the _Pabulum_ of Plants, ’tis not\r\n  unlikely, that Roots may insume no grosser Particles, than those on\r\n  which the Colours of Bodies depend; but to discover the greatest\r\n  of those Corpuscles, Sir _Isaac Newton_ thinks, it will require a\r\n  Microscope, that with sufficient Distinctness can represent Objects\r\n  Five or Six hundred times bigger, than at a Foot Distance they appear\r\n  to the naked Eye.\r\n\r\n  My Microscope indeed is but a very ordinary one, and when I view with\r\n  it the Liquor newly imbibed by a fibrous Root of a Mint, it seems\r\n  more limpid than the clearest common Water, nothing at all appearing\r\n  in it.\r\n\r\n  [13] Either Roots must insume the Earth, that is their _Pabulum_,\r\n  as they find it in whole Pieces, having intire Superficies of their\r\n  own, or else such Particles as have not intire Superficies of their\r\n  own, but want some Part of it, which adheres to, or is Part of the\r\n  Superficies of larger Particles, before they are separated by Roots.\r\n  The former they cannot insume (unless contained in Water); because\r\n  they would fly away at the first Pores that were open: _Ergo_ they\r\n  must insume the latter.\r\n\r\nA Plant cannot separate these Particles from the Parts to which they\r\nadhere, without the Assistance of Water, which helps to loosen them.\r\n\r\nAnd ’tis also probable, that the Nitre of the Air may be necessary to\r\nrelax this Superficies, to render the prolific Particles capable of\r\nbeing thence disjoin’d; and this Action of the Nitre seems to be what\r\nis call’d, Impregnating the Earth.\r\n\r\nSince the grosser Vegetable Particles, when they have pass’d thro’\r\na Plant, together with their moist Vehicle, do fly up into the Air\r\ninvisibly; ’tis not likely they should, in the Earth, fall off from the\r\nSuperficies of the Pores, by their own Gravity: And if they did fall\r\noff, they might fly away as easily before they enter’d Plants, as they\r\ndo after they have pass’d thro’ them; and then a Soil might become the\r\npoorer[14] for all the Culture and Stirring we bestow upon it; tho’ no\r\nPlants were in it; contrary to Experience.\r\n\r\n  [14] But we see it is always the richer by being frequently turned\r\n  and exposed to the Atmosphere: Therefore Plants must take all their\r\n  _Pabulum_ from a Superficies of Parts of Earth; except what may\r\n  perhaps be contained in Water fine enough to enter Roots intire with\r\n  the Water.\r\n\r\nIt must be own’d, that Water does ever carry, in its Interstices,\r\nParticles of Earth fine enough to enter Roots; because I have seen,\r\nthat a great Quantity of Earth (in my Experiments) will pass out of\r\nRoots set in Rain-water; and tis found that Water can never be, by\r\nany Art, wholly freed from its earthy Charge; therefore it must have\r\ncarry’d in some Particles of Earth along with it: But yet I cannot\r\nhence conclude, that the Water did first take these fine Particles\r\nfrom the aforesaid Superficies: I rather think, that they are exhal’d,\r\ntogether with very small Pieces to which they adhere, and in the Vapour\r\ndivided by the Aereal Nitre; and, when the Vapour is condens’d, they\r\ndescend with it to replenish the Pasture of Plants; and that these\r\ndo not enter intire into Roots, neither does any other of the earthy\r\nCharge that any Water contains; except such fine Particles which have\r\nalready pass’d thro’ the Vegetable Vessels, and been thence exhal’d.\r\n\r\nThis Conjecture is the more probable, for that Rain-Water is as\r\nnourishing to Plants set therein as Spring-Water, tho’ the latter have\r\nmore Earth in it; and tho’ Spring-water have some Particles in it that\r\nwill enter intire into Roots, yet we must consider, that even that\r\nWater may have been many times exhal’d into the Air, and may have still\r\nretain’d a great Quantity of Vegetable Particles, which it received\r\nfrom Vegetable Exhalations in the Atmosphere; tho’ not so great a\r\nQuantity as Rain-water, that comes immediately thence.\r\n\r\nThese, I have to do with, are the Particles which Plants have from the\r\nEarth, or Soil; but they have also fine Particles of Earth from Water,\r\nwhich may impart some of its finest Charge to the Superficies of Roots,\r\nas well as to the Superficies of the Parts of the Earth[15] which makes\r\nthe Pasture of Plants.\r\n\r\n  [15] If Water does separate, and take any of the mere _Pabulum_ of\r\n  Plants from the Soil, it gives much more to it.\r\n\r\nYet it seems, that much of the Earth, contain’d in the clearest Water,\r\nis there in too large Parts to enter a Root; since we see, that in a\r\nshort time the Root’s Superficies will, in the purest Water, be cover’d\r\nwith Earth, which is then form’d into a terrene Pasture, which may\r\nnourish Roots; but very few Plants will live long in so thin a Pasture,\r\nas any Water affords them. I cannot find one as yet that has liv’d a\r\nYear, without some Earth have been added to it.\r\n\r\nAnd all Aquatics, that I know, have their Roots in the Earth, tho’\r\ncover’d with Water.\r\n\r\nThe Pores, Cavities, or Interstices of the Earth, being of two Sorts,\r\n_viz._ _Natural_ and _Artificial_; the one affords the Natural, the\r\nother the Artificial Pasture of Plants.\r\n\r\nThe natural Pasture alone will suffice, to furnish a Country with\r\nVegetables, for the Maintenance of a few Inhabitants; but if\r\nAgriculture were taken out of the World, ’tis much to be fear’d, that\r\nthose of all populous Countries, especially towards the Confines of the\r\nfrigid Zones (for there the Trees often fail of producing Fruit), would\r\nbe oblig’d to turn _Anthropophagi_, as in many uncultivated Regions\r\nthey do, very probably for that Reason.\r\n\r\nThe artificial Pasture of Plants is that inner Superficies which is\r\nmade from dividing the Soil by Art.\r\n\r\nThis does, on all Parts of the Globe, where used, maintain many more\r\nPeople than the natural Pasture[16]; and in the colder Climates, I\r\nbelieve, it will not be extravagant to say, ten times as many: Or\r\nthat, in Case Agriculture were a little improved (as I hope to shew is\r\nnot difficult to be done), it might maintain twice as many more yet, or\r\nthe same Number, better.\r\n\r\n  [16] The extraordinary Increase of St. Foin, Clover, and natural\r\n  Grass, when their Roots reach into pulveriz’d Earth, exceeding the\r\n  Increase of all those other Plants of the same Species (that stand\r\n  out of the Reach of it) above One hundred Times, shew how vastly the\r\n  artificial Pasture of Plants exceeds the natural. A full Proof of\r\n  this Difference, (besides very many I have had before) was seen by\r\n  two Intervals in the middle of a poor Field of worn-out St. Foin,\r\n  pulveriz’d in the precedent Summer, in the manner describ’d in a\r\n  Note on the latter Part of Chap. XII. relating to _St. Foin_. Here\r\n  not only the _St. Foin_ adjoining to these Intervals recover’d its\r\n  Strength, blossom’d, and seeded well, but also the natural Grass\r\n  amongst it was as strong, and had as flourishing a Colour, as if\r\n  a Dung-heap had been laid in the Intervals; also many other Weeds\r\n  came out from the Edges of the unplow’d Ground, which must have lain\r\n  dormant a great many Years, grew higher and larger than ever were\r\n  seen before in that Field; but above all, there was a Weed amongst\r\n  the St. _Foin_, which generally accompanies it, bearing a white\r\n  Flower; some call it _White Weed_, others _Lady’s Bedstraw_: Some\r\n  Plants of this that stood near the Intervals, were, in the Opinion of\r\n  all that saw them, increased to a thousand Times the Bulk of those\r\n  of the same Species, that stood in the Field three Feet distant from\r\n  such pulveriz’d Earth.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, These Intervals were each an Hundred Perch long, and had\r\n  each in them a treble Row of Barley very good. The Reason I take\r\n  to be this, That the Land had lain still several Years after its\r\n  artificial Pasture was lost; whereby all the Plants in it having only\r\n  the natural Pasture to subsist on, became so extremely _small_ and\r\n  _weak_, that they were not able to exhaust the Land of so great a\r\n  Quantity of the (vegetable) nourishing Particles as the Atmosphere\r\n  brought down to it.\r\n\r\n  And when by Pulveration the artificial Pasture came to be added\r\n  to this natural Pasture (not much exhausted), and nothing at all\r\n  suffered to grow out of it for above Three Quarters of a Year, it\r\n  became rich enough, without any Manure, to produce this extraordinary\r\n  Effect upon the Vegetables, whose Roots reached into it. How long\r\n  this Effect may continue, is uncertain: but I may venture to say, it\r\n  will continue until the Exhaustion by Vegetables doth over-balance\r\n  the Descent of the Atmosphere, and the Pulveration.\r\n\r\n  And what I have said of any one Species of Plants in this Respect may\r\n  be generally apply’d to the rest.\r\n\r\nThe natural Pasture is not only less than the artificial, in an equal\r\nQuantity of Earth; but also, that little consisting in the Superficies\r\nof Pores, or Cavities, not having a free Communication[17] with one\r\nanother, being less pervious to the Roots of all Vegetables, and\r\nrequiring a greater Force to break thro’ their Partitions; by that\r\nMeans, Roots, especially of weak Plants, are excluded from many of\r\nthose Cavities, and so lose the Benefit of them.\r\n\r\n  [17] None of the natural Vegetable Pasture is lost or injured by the\r\n  artificial; but on the contrary, ’tis mended by being mix’d with it,\r\n  and by having a greater Communication betwixt Pore and Pore.\r\n\r\nBut the artificial Pasture consists in Superficies of Cavities, that\r\nare pervious to all Manner of Roots, and that afford them free Passage\r\nand Entertainment in and thro’ all their Recesses. Roots may here\r\nextend to the utmost, without meeting with any Barricadoes in their Way.\r\n\r\nThe internal Superficies, which is the natural Pasture of Plants, is\r\nlike the external Superficies or Surface of the Earth, whereon is the\r\nPasture of Cattle; in that it cannot be inlarg’d without Addition of\r\nmore Surface taken from Land adjoining to it, by inlarging its Bounds\r\nor Limits.\r\n\r\nBut the artificial Pasture of Plants may be inlarg’d, without any\r\nAddition of more Land, or inlarging of Bounds, and this by Division\r\nonly of the same Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd this artificial Pasture may be increas’d in proportion to the\r\nDivision of the Parts of Earth, whereof it is the Superficies, which\r\nDivision may be mathematically infinite; for an Atom is nothing;\r\nneither is there a more plain Impossibility in Nature, than to reduce\r\nMatter to nothing, by Division or Separation of its Parts.\r\n\r\nA Cube of Earth of One Foot has but Six Feet of Superficies. Divide\r\nthis Cube into Cubical Inches, and then its Superficies will be\r\nincreas’d Twelve times, _viz._ to Seventy-two Superficial Feet. Divide\r\nthese again in like Manner and Proportion; that is, Divide them into\r\nParts that bear the same Proportion to the Inches, as the Inches do to\r\nthe Feet, and then the same Earth, which had at first no more than Six\r\nSuperficial Feet, will have Eight hundred Sixty-four Superficial Feet\r\nof artificial Pasture; and so is the Soil divisible, and this Pasture\r\nincreasable _ad Infinitum_.\r\n\r\nThe common Methods of dividing the Soil are these; _viz._ by _Dung_, by\r\n_Tillage_, or by both[18].\r\n\r\n  [18] For _Vis Unita Fortior_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n_Of DUNG._\r\n\r\n\r\nALL Sorts of Dung and Compost contain some Matter, which, when mixt\r\nwith the Soil, ferments therein; and by such Ferment dissolves,\r\ncrumbles, and divides the Earth very much: This is the chief, and\r\nalmost only Use of Dung: For, as to the pure earthy Part, the Quantity\r\nis so very small, that, after a perfect Putrefaction, it appears to\r\nbear a most inconsiderable Proportion to the Soil it is design’d to\r\nmanure: and therefore, in that respect, is next to nothing.\r\n\r\nIts fermenting Quality is chiefly owing to the Salts wherewith it\r\nabounds; but a very little of this Salt applied alone to a few Roots\r\nof almost any Plant, will (as, in my Mint Experiments, it is evident\r\ncommon Salt does) kill it.\r\n\r\nThis proves, that its Use is not to nourish, but to dissolve; _i. e._\r\nDivide the terrestrial Matter, which affords Nutriment to the Mouths of\r\nVegetable Roots.\r\n\r\nIt is, I suppose, upon the Account of the acrimonious fiery Nature\r\nof these Salts, that the Florists have banish’d Dung from their\r\nFlower-Gardens.\r\n\r\nAnd there is, I’m sure, much more Reason to prohibit the Use of Dung in\r\nthe Kitchen-Garden, on Account of the ill Taste it gives to esculent\r\nRoots and Plants, especially such Dung as is made in great Towns.\r\n\r\n’Tis a Wonder how delicate Palates can dispense with eating their own\r\nand their Beasts Ordure, but a little more putrefied and evaporated;\r\ntogether with all Sorts of Filth and Nastiness, a Tincture of which\r\nthose Roots must unavoidably receive, that grow amongst it.\r\n\r\nIndeed I do not admire, that learned Palates, accustom’d to the _Goût_\r\nof _Silphium_, _Garlick_, _la Chair venee_, and mortify’d Venison,\r\nequalling the Stench and Rankness of this Sort of City-Muck, should\r\nrelish and approve of Plants that are fed and fatted by its immediate\r\nContact.\r\n\r\nPeople who are so vulgarly nice, as to nauseate these modish Dainties,\r\nand whose squeamish Stomachs even abhor to receive the Food of Nobles,\r\nso little different from that wherewith they regale their richest\r\nGardens, say that even the very Water, wherein a rich Garden Cabbage\r\nis boil’d, stinks; but that the Water, wherein a Cabbage from a poor\r\nundung’d Field is boil’d, has no Manner of unpleasant Savour; and that\r\na Carrot, bred in a Dunghill, has none of that sweet Relish, which a\r\nField-Carrot affords.\r\n\r\nThere is a like Difference in all Roots, nourish’d with such different\r\nDiet.\r\n\r\nDung not only spoils the fine Flavour of these our Eatables, but\r\ninquinates good Liquor. The dung’d Vineyards in _Languedoc_ produce\r\nnauseous Wine; from whence there is a Proverb in that Country, That\r\npoor People’s Wine is best, because they carry no Dung to their\r\nVineyards.\r\n\r\nDung is observ’d to give great Encouragement to the Production of\r\nWorms; and Carrots in the Garden are much worm-eaten, when those in the\r\nField are free from Worms.\r\n\r\nDung is the Putrefaction of Earth, after it has been alter’d by\r\nVegetable or Animal Vessels. But if Dung be thoroughly ventilated and\r\nputrefy’d before it be spread on the Field (as I think all the Authors\r\nI have read direct) so much of its Salts will be spent in fermenting\r\nthe Dung itself, that little of them will remain to ferment the Soil;\r\nand the Farmer who might dung One Acre in Twenty, by laying on his Dung\r\nwhilst fully replete with vigorous Salts, may (if he follows these\r\nWriters Advice to a Nicety) be forced to content himself with dunging\r\none Acre in an Hundred.\r\n\r\nThis indeed is good Advice for Gardeners, for making their Stuff more\r\npalatable and wholesome; but would ruin the Farmer who could have no\r\nmore Dung than what he could make upon his Arable Farm.\r\n\r\nFor every Sort of Dung, the longer Time it ferments without the Ground,\r\nthe lesser Time it has to ferment in it, and the weaker its Ferment\r\nwill be.\r\n\r\nThe Reason given for this great Diminution of Dung is, that the Seeds\r\nof Weeds may be rotted, and lose their vegetating Faculty; but this I\r\nam certain of by Demonstration, that let a Dunghil remain Three Years\r\nunmov’d, though its Bulk be vastly diminish’d in that Time, and its\r\nbest Quality lost, Charlock-seed will remain found in it, and stock\r\nthe Land whereon it is laid: For that Ferment which is sufficient to\r\nconsume the Virtue of the stercoreous Salts, is not sufficient to\r\ndestroy the vegative Virtue of Charlock-seeds, nor (I believe) of many\r\nother Sorts of Weeds.\r\n\r\nThe very Effluvia of animal Bodies, sent off by Perspiration, are so\r\nnoxious as to kill the Animal that emits them, if confin’d to receive\r\nthem back in great Quantity, by breathing in an Air replete with them;\r\nwhich appears from the soon dying of an Animal shut up in a Receiver\r\nfull of Air. Yet this seems to be the most harmless of all sorts of\r\nanimal Excrements the Air can be infected with. How noxious then must\r\nbe the more fetid Steams of Ordure!\r\n\r\nIf a Catalogue were publish’d of all Instances from Charnel-houses (or\r\nCœmeteries) and of the pestiferous Effects, which have happen’d from\r\nthe Putrefaction of dead Bodies, after great Battles, even in the open\r\nAir, no body, I believe, would have a good Opinion of the Wholsomeness\r\nof Animal Dung; for if a great Quantity do so infect the Air, ’tis\r\nlikely a less may infect it in proportion to that less Quantity.\r\n\r\nIn great Cities the Air is full of these Effluvia, which in hot Climes\r\noften produce the Pestilence; and in cold Climes People are generally\r\nobserv’d to live a less time, and less healthfully, in Cities, than\r\nin the Country; to which Difference, ’tis likely, that the eating\r\nunwholsome Gardenage may contribute.\r\n\r\nThis Dung is a fitter Food for venomous Creatures[19] than for edible\r\nPlants; and ’tis (no doubt) upon Account of this, that dung’d Gardens\r\nare so much frequented by Toads, which are seldom or never seen in the\r\nopen undung’d Fields.\r\n\r\n  [19] Mr. _Evelyn_ says, that Dung is the Nurse of Vermin.\r\n\r\nWhat can we say then to the Salubrity of those Roots themselves, bred\r\nup and fatten’d among these Toads and Corruption? The Leaves indeed are\r\nonly discharging some of the Filth, when we eat them; but the Roots\r\nhave that unsavoury infected Food in their very Mouths, when we take\r\nthem for our Nourishment.\r\n\r\nBut tho’ _Dung_ be, upon these and other Accounts, injurious to the\r\nGarden, yet a considerable Quantity of it is so necessary to most\r\nCorn-fields, that without it little Good can be done by the old\r\nHusbandry.\r\n\r\n_Dung_ is not injurious to the Fields[20] being there in less\r\nProportion: And the Produce of Corn is the Grain. When the Leaves have\r\ndone their utmost to purify the Sap, the most refin’d Part is secern’d\r\nto be yet further elaborated by peculiar Organs; then, by the Vessels\r\nof the Blossoms, ’tis become double-refin’d, for the Nourishment of the\r\nGrain; which is therefore more pure from Dung, and more wholsome, than\r\nany other Part of the Plant that bears it.\r\n\r\n  [20] Such Plants as _Cabbages_, _Turneps_, _Carrots_, and _Potatoes_,\r\n  when they are designed only for fatting of Cattle, will not be\r\n  injured by Dung, Tillage, and Hoeing all together, which will make\r\n  the Crops the greater, and the Cattle will like them never the worse.\r\n\r\nAnd common Tillage alone is not sufficient for many Sorts of Corn,\r\nespecially Wheat, which is the King of Grains.\r\n\r\nVery few Fields can have the Conveniency of a sufficient Supply of\r\nDung, to enable them to produce half the Wheat those will do near\r\nCities, where they have Plenty of it.\r\n\r\nThe Crop of 20 Acres will scarce make Dung sufficient for one Acre, in\r\nthe common Way of laying it on.\r\n\r\nThe Action of the Dung’s Ferment affords a Warmth[21] to the\r\nInfant-plants, in their most tender State, and the most rigorous Season.\r\n\r\n  [21] But though Dung in fermenting may have a little Warmth, yet\r\n  it may sometimes, by letting more Water enter its Hollowness, be\r\n  in a Frost much colder than undung’d pulverized Earth; for I have\r\n  seen Wheat-plants in the Winter die in the very Spits of Dung, when\r\n  undung’d drill’d Wheat, adjoining to it, planted at the same Time,\r\n  has flourish’d all the same Winter; and I could, not find any other\r\n  Reason for this, but the Hollowness of the Dung; and yet it seemed to\r\n  be well rotted.\r\n\r\nBut ’tis hard to know how long the Warmth of this Ferment lasteth, by\r\nreason of the great Difficulty to distinguish the very least Degree of\r\nHeat from the very least Degree of Cold.\r\n\r\nUnder the Name of Dung we may also understand whatever ferments with\r\nthe Earth (except Fire); such as green Vegetables cover’d in the\r\nGround, _&c._\r\n\r\nAs to the Difference of the Quantity of artificial Pasture made by\r\n_Dung_ without Tillage, and that made by Tillage without _Dung_; the\r\nlatter is many Times greater, of which I had the following Proof. An\r\nunplow’d Land, wherein a Dunghil had lain for two or three Years, and\r\nbeing taken away, was planted with _Turneps_; at the same time a till’d\r\nLand, contiguous thereto, was drill’d with _Turneps_, and Horse-ho’d;\r\nthe other, being Hand-ho’d, prospered best at the first; but at last\r\ndid not amount to the Fifth Part of the Till’d and Horse-ho’d, in\r\nBigness, nor in Crop. The Benefit of the Dung and Hand-hoe was so\r\ninconsiderable, in comparison of the Plough and Hoe-plough; the little\r\nQuantity of artificial Pasture raised to the other, was only near the\r\nSurface, and did not reach deep enough to maintain the _Turneps_,\r\ntill they arrived at the Fifth Part of the Growth of those, whose\r\nartificial Pasture reach’d to the Bottom of the Staple of the Land.\r\n\r\nA like Proof is; that several Lands of _Turneps_, drill’d on the Level,\r\nat three Foot Rows, plow’d, and doubly dung’d, and also Horse-ho’d,\r\ndid not produce near so good a Crop of _Turneps_, as Six Foot Ridges\r\nadjoining, Horse-ho’d, tho’ no Dung had been laid thereon for many\r\nYears: There was no other Difference, than that the three Foot Rows did\r\nnot admit the Hoe-plough to raise half the artificial Pasture, as the\r\nSix Foot Rows did. The Dung plow’d into the narrow Intervals, before\r\ndrilling, could operate no further, with any great Effect, than the\r\nHoe-plough could turn it up, and help in its Pulveration.\r\n\r\n_Dung_, without Tillage, can do very little; with some Tillage doth\r\nsomething; with much Tillage pulverizes the Soil in less Time, than\r\nTillage alone can do; but the Tillage alone, with more Time, can\r\npulverize as well: This the Experiments of _artificially_ pulverizing\r\nof the poorest Land, as they are related by Mr. _Evelyn_, fully prove.\r\n\r\nAnd these Experiments are the more to be depended on, as they are made\r\nboth in _England_ and _Holland_ by Persons of known Integrity.\r\n\r\nThis Truth is also further confirmed by those Authors who have found,\r\nthat High-way Dust alone is a Manure preferable to Dung: And all these\r\nPulverations being made by Attrition or Contusion, why should not our\r\nInstruments of Pulveration, in Time, reduce a sufficient Part of the\r\nStaple of a dry friable Soil, to a Dust equal to that of a Highway?\r\n\r\nThe common Proportion of Dung used in the Field pulverizes only a\r\nsmall Part of the Staple: but how long a time may be required for our\r\nInstruments to pulverize an equal Part, it depending much upon the\r\nWeather, and the Degree of Friability of the Soil, is uncertain.\r\n\r\nI have seen surprising Effects from Ground, after being kept\r\nunexhausted, by plowing with common Ploughs for Two whole Years\r\nrunning: And I am confident, that the Expence of this extraordinary\r\nTillage and Fallow will not, in many Places, amount to above half the\r\nExpence of a dressing with Dung; and if the Land be all the Time kept\r\nin our Sort of little Ridges of the Size most proper for that Purpose,\r\nthe Expence of plowing will be diminished one half; besides the\r\nAdvantage the Earth of such Ridges hath, of being friable in Weather\r\nwhich is too moist for plowing the same Land on the Level.\r\n\r\nI have made many Trials of fine _Dung_ on the Rows; and,\r\nnotwithstanding the Benefit of it, I have, for these several Years last\r\npast, left it off, finding that a little more Hoeing will supply it at\r\na much less Expence, than that of so small a Quantity of Manure, and of\r\nthe Hands necessary to lay it on, and of the Carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of_ TILLAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTillage is breaking and dividing the Ground by Spade, Plough, Hoe, or\r\nother Instruments, which divide by a Sort of Attrition (or Contusion)\r\nas Dung does by Fermentation[22].\r\n\r\n  [22] _Neque enim aliud est Colere quam Resolvere, & Fermentare\r\n  Terram._ Columella.\r\n\r\n  And since the artificial Pasture of Plants is made and increas’d by\r\n  Pulveration, ’tis no Matter whether it be by the Ferment of _Dung_,\r\n  the Attrition of the _Plough_, the Contusion of the _Roller_, or\r\n  by any other Instrument or Means whatsoever, except by Fire, which\r\n  carries away all the Cement of that which is burnt.\r\n\r\nBy Dung we are limited to the Quantity of it we can procure, which in\r\nmost Places is too scanty: But by Tillage, we can inlarge our Field of\r\nsubterranean Pasture without Limitation, tho’ the external Surface of\r\nit be confin’d within narrow Bounds: Tillage may extend the Earth’s\r\ninternal Superficies, in proportion to the Division of its Parts; and\r\nas Division is infinite, so may that Superficies be.\r\n\r\nEvery Time the Earth is broken by any Sort of Tillage, or Division,\r\nthere must arise some new Superficies of the broken Parts, which never\r\nhas been open before. For when the Parts of Earth are once united and\r\nincorporated together, ’tis morally impossible, that they, or any of\r\nthem, should be broken again, only in the same Places; for to do that,\r\nsuch Parts must have again the same numerical Figures and Dimensions\r\nthey had before such Breaking, which even by an infinite Division could\r\nnever be likely to happen: As the Letters of a Distichon, cut out and\r\nmixt, if they should be thrown up never so often, would never be likely\r\nto fall into the same Order and Position with one another, so as to\r\nrecompose the same Distich.\r\n\r\nAlthough the internal Superficies may have been drain’d by a preceding\r\nCrop, and the next Plowing may move many of the before divided Parts,\r\nwithout new-breaking them; yet such as are new-broken, have, at such\r\nPlaces where they are so broken, a new Superficies, which never was,\r\nor did exist before; because we cannot reasonably suppose, that any of\r\nthose Parts can have in all places (if in any Places) the same Figure\r\nand Dimensions twice.\r\n\r\nFor as Matter is divisible _ad infinitum_, the Places or Lines whereat\r\n’tis so divisible, must be, in relation to Number, infinite, that is to\r\nsay, without Number; and must have at every Division Superficies of\r\nParts of infinite Variety[23] in Figure and Dimensions.\r\n\r\n  [23] Their Variety is such, that ’tis next to impossible, any two\r\n  Pieces, or Clods, in a Thousand Acres of till’d Ground, should have\r\n  the same Figure, and equal Dimensions, or that any Piece should\r\n  exactly tally with any other, except with that from whence it was\r\n  broken off.\r\n\r\nAnd because ’tis morally impossible, the same Figure and Dimensions\r\nshould happen twice to any one Part, we need not wonder, how the\r\nEarth, every time of Tilling, should afford a new internal Superficies\r\n(or artificial Pasture); and that the till’d Soil has in it an\r\ninexhaustible Fund, which by a sufficient Division (being capable of an\r\ninfinite one) may be produc’d.\r\n\r\nTillage (as well as Dung) is beneficial to all Sorts of Land[24]. Light\r\nLand, being naturally hollow, has larger Pores, which are the Cause of\r\nits Lightness: This, when it is by any Means sufficiently divided,\r\nthe Parts being brought nearer together, becomes, for a time, Bulk for\r\nBulk, heavier; _i. e._ The same Quantity will be contain’d in less\r\nRoom, and so is made to partake of the Nature and Benefits of strong\r\nLand, _viz._ to keep out too much Heat and Cold, and the like.\r\n\r\n  [24] ’Tis of late fully prov’d, by the Experience of many Farmers,\r\n  that two or three additional Plowings will supply the Place of Dung,\r\n  even in the old Husbandry, if they be perform’d at proper Seasons:\r\n  and the hiring Price of three Plowings, after Land has been thrice\r\n  plow’d before, is but Twelve Shillings, whereas a Dunging will cost\r\n  three Pounds: This was accidentally discovered in my Neighbourhood,\r\n  by the Practice of a poor Farmer, who, when he had prepared his Land\r\n  for Barley, and could not procure Seed to sow it, plow’d it on till\r\n  Wheat Seed-Time, and (by means of such additional Plowing) without\r\n  Dung, had so good a Crop of Wheat, that it was judg’d to be more than\r\n  the Inheritance of the Land it grew on.\r\n\r\n  The same Effect follows when they prepare Land for Turneps, since\r\n  they are come in Fashion, and sow them several Times upon several\r\n  Plowings, the Fly as often taking them off; they have from such\r\n  extraordinary Tillage a good Crop of Wheat, instead of the lost\r\n  Turneps, without the Help of Dung; hence double-plowing is now become\r\n  frequent in this Country.\r\n\r\n  The Reason why Land is enrich’d by lying long unplow’d, is that so\r\n  very few Vegetables are carried off it, very little being produc’d;\r\n  the Exhaustion is less than what is added by the Atmosphere, Cattle,\r\n  _&c._ But when ’tis plow’d, a vastly greater Quantity of Vegetables\r\n  is produc’d, and carried off, more than by the old Husbandry is\r\n  return’d to it.\r\n\r\nBut strong Land, being naturally less porous, is made for a Time\r\nlighter (as well as richer) by a good Division; the Separation of its\r\nParts makes it more porous, and causes it to take up more Room than it\r\ndoes in its natural State; and then it partakes of all the Benefits of\r\nlighter Land.\r\n\r\nWhen strong Land is plow’d, and not sufficiently, so that the Parts\r\nremain gross, ’tis said to be rough, and it has not the Benefit of\r\nTillage; because most of the artificial Pores (or Interstices) are too\r\nlarge; and then it partakes of the Inconveniences of the hollow Land\r\nuntill’d.\r\n\r\nFor when the light Land is plow’d but once, that is not sufficient\r\nto diminish its natural Hollowness (or Pores;) and, for Want of more\r\nTillage, the Parts into which ’tis divided by that once (or perhaps\r\ntwice) Plowing, remain too large; and consequently the artificial Pores\r\nare large also, and, in that respect, are like the ill-till’d strong\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nLight-land, having naturally less internal Superficies, seems to\r\nrequire the more Tillage[25] or Dung to enrich it; as when the poor,\r\nhollow, thin Downs have their upper Part (which is the best) burnt,\r\nwhereby all, (except a _Caput Mortuum_) is carried away; yet the Salts\r\nof this spread upon that barren Part of the Staple, which is unburnt,\r\ndivide it into so very minute Particles, that their Pasture will\r\nnourish two or three good Crops of Corn: But then the Plough, even with\r\na considerable Quantity of Dung, is never able afterwards to make a\r\nDivision equal to what those Salts have done; and therefore such burnt\r\nLand remains barren.\r\n\r\n  [25] As for puffy Land, which naturally swells up, instead of\r\n  subsiding, tho’ its Hollowness is much abated by Tillage, yet it is\r\n  thought little better than barren Land, and unprofitable for Corn:\r\n  But what we usually call Light-land, is only comparatively so, in\r\n  Respect of that which is heavier and stronger. And this Sort of Light\r\n  land becomes much lighter by being ill-till’d; the unbroken Pieces\r\n  of Turf underneath undissolved, forming large Cavities, increase\r\n  its Hollowness, and consequently its Lightness: I have often known\r\n  this Sort of Land despis’d by its Owners, who fear’d to give it due\r\n  Tillage, which they thought would make it so light, that the Wind\r\n  would blow it away; but whenever such has been thoroughly till’d, it\r\n  never fail’d to become much stronger than before; and considering\r\n  that ’tis till’d with less Expence than very strong Land, it is,\r\n  for several Sorts of Corn, found to be more profitable than Land of\r\n  greater Strength and Richness, that is more difficult to be till’d.\r\n\r\n  And I am apt to think, that this Sort of Light-land acquires more\r\n  Cement, by having its _external_ Superficies often changed, and\r\n  exposed to the Dews, and other Benefits of the Atmosphere, as well as\r\n  by the Increase of (its _internal_ Superficies, which is the Surfaces\r\n  of all the divided Parts of Earth, or) the Pasture of Plants; the one\r\n  being augmented by the other; _i. e._, that into the more Parts the\r\n  Earth is broken, the more Cement will it attain, from the Sulphur,\r\n  which is brought by the Dews.\r\n\r\nArtificial Pores cannot be too small, because Roots may the more\r\neasily enter the Soil that has them, quite contrary to natural Pores;\r\nfor these may be, and generally are, too small, and too hard for the\r\nEntrance of all weak Roots, and for the free Entrance of strong Roots.\r\n\r\nInsufficient Tillage leaves strong Land with its natural Pores too\r\nsmall, and its artificial ones too large. It leaves Light-land, with\r\nits natural and artificial Pores both too large.\r\n\r\nPores that are too small in hard Ground, will not easily permit Roots\r\nto enter them.\r\n\r\nPores that are too large in any Sort of Land, can be of little other\r\nUse to Roots, but only to give them Passage to other Cavities more\r\nproper for them; and if in any Place they lie open to the Air, they are\r\ndry’d up, and spoil’d, before they reach them.\r\n\r\nFor fibrous Roots (which alone maintain the Plant; the other Roots\r\nserve for receiving the Chyle from them, and convey it to the Stem) can\r\ntake in no Nourishment from any Cavity, unless they come into Contact\r\nwith[26], and press against, all the Superficies of that Cavity, which\r\nincludes them; for it dispenses the Food to their Lacteals by such\r\nPressure only: But a fibrous Root is not so press’d by the Superficies\r\nof a Cavity whose Diameter is greater than that of the Root.\r\n\r\n  [26] Roots cannot have any Nourishment from Cavities of the Earth\r\n  that are too large to press against them, except what Water, when\r\n  ’tis in great Quantity, brings to them, which is imbibed by the\r\n  gentle Pressure of the Water; but when the Water is gone, those large\r\n  Cavities being empty, the Pressure ceases; and this is the Reason,\r\n  that when Land has few other but such large Cavities, the Plants in\r\n  it always suffer more by dry Weather, than in Land which by Dung or\r\n  Tillage has more minute and fewer large Cavities.\r\n\r\n  There may be some Moisture on the Superficies of large Cavities; but\r\n  without Pressure the fibrous Roots cannot reach it; and very little\r\n  or no Pressure can be made to one Part of the Root’s Superficies,\r\n  unless the Whole that is included be pressed.\r\n\r\n  If it be objected that a Charlock-Plant, when pulled up, and thrown\r\n  upon the Ground, will grow thereon; this proves nothing against the\r\n  Necessity of Pressure, _&c._ for the Weight of that Plant presses\r\n  some of its Roots so closely against the Ground, that they send out\r\n  (unless the Weather be very dry) new Fibres into the Earth; and there\r\n  they are pressed in all their Superficies; without which Fibres the\r\n  Plant doth not grow.\r\n\r\nThe Surfaces of great Clods form Declivities on every Side of them, and\r\nlarge Cavities, which are as Sinks to convey, what Rain and Dew bring,\r\ntoo quickly downwards to below the plow’d Part.\r\n\r\nThe first and second Plowings with common Ploughs scarce deserve the\r\nName of Tillage; they rather serve to prepare the Land for Tillage.\r\n\r\nThe third, fourth, and every subsequent Plowing, may be of more\r\nBenefit, and less Expence, than any of the preceding ones.\r\n\r\nBut the last Plowings will be more advantageously perform’d by Way of\r\nHoeing, as in the following Chapters will appear.\r\n\r\nFor the finer Land is made by Tillage, the richer will it become, and\r\nthe more Plants it will maintain.\r\n\r\nIt has been often observ’d, that when Part of a Ground has been better\r\ntill’d than the rest, and the whole Ground constantly manag’d alike\r\nafterwards for six or seven Years successively; this Part that was but\r\nonce better till’d, always produc’d a better Crop than the rest, and\r\nthe Difference remain’d very visible every Harvest.\r\n\r\nOne Part being once made finer, the Dews did more enrich it; for they\r\npenetrate within and beyond the Superficies, whereto the Roots are\r\nable to enter: The fine Parts of the Earth are impregnate, throughout\r\ntheir whole Substance, with some of the Riches carried in by the Dews,\r\nand there reposited; until, by new Tillage, the Insides of those fine\r\nParts become Superficies; and as the Corn drains them, they are again\r\nsupply’d as before; but the rough large Parts cannot have that Benefit;\r\nthe Dews not penetrating to their Centres, they remain poorer.\r\n\r\nI think nothing can be said more strongly to confirm the Truth of this,\r\nthan what is related by the Authors quoted by Mr. _Evelyn_[27], to this\r\nEffect, _viz._\r\n\r\n  [27] In Pag. 17, 18, and 19, of his _Phil. Discourse of Earth_.\r\n\r\n‘Take of the most barren Earth you can find, pulverize it well, and\r\nexpose it abroad for a Year, incessantly agitated[28]; it will become\r\nso fertile as to receive an exotic Plant from the furthest _Indies_;\r\nand to cause all Vegetables to prosper in the most exalted Degree, and\r\nto bear their Fruit as kindly with us as in their natural Climates.’\r\n\r\n  [28] _i. e._ Stirr’d often.\r\n\r\nThis artificial Dust[29], he says, will entertain Plants which refuse\r\nDung, and other violent Applications; and that it has a more nutritive\r\nPower than any artificial Dungs or Compost whatsoever: And further,\r\nthat by this Toil of pulverizing, “’tis found, that Soil may be so\r\nstrangely alter’d from its former Nature, as to render the harm and\r\nmost uncivil Clay[30] obsequious to the Husbandmen, and to bring forth\r\nRoots and Plants, which otherwise require the lighted and hollowest\r\nMould[31].”\r\n\r\n  [29] Tho’ it may be impossible for the Plough to reduce the whole\r\n  Staple into so fine Powder, yet the more internal Superficies it\r\n  makes, the more Dust will be made by the Atmosphere in Proportion;\r\n  and great Clods perhaps are of no Use to Plants, but by that Dust\r\n  they let fall, being thence extricated by the insensible Ferment\r\n  of the nitrous Air; and the Surfaces of this artificial Dust must\r\n  receive such Operations from the Air, before the utmost Fertility be\r\n  obtain’d.\r\n\r\n  [30] But I take harsh uncivil Clay to be the least profitable of any\r\n  to keep in Tillage.\r\n\r\n  [31] To this Dust, _Namque hoc imitamur arando_ ought to be apply’d,\r\n  and not to _Putre Solum_, which itself needs Tillage, as well as\r\n  strong Land: But it seems the Antients did not observe the Difference\r\n  between natural Pores (or Hollowness) and artificial ones, tho’ it is\r\n  very great; as is shewn in Chap. of _Pasture of Plants_: ’Tis easier\r\n  indeed to imitate this artificial Dust in _hollow_ than in _strong_\r\n  Land.\r\n\r\n’Tis to be suppos’d, that the _Indian_ Plants had their due Degrees of\r\nHeat and Moisture given them; and I should not chuse to bestow this\r\nToil upon the poorest of Earth in a Field or Garden, tho’ that be the\r\nmost sure wherein to make the Experiment[32].\r\n\r\n  [32] This is the most proper Trial of the Effect of Pulveration by\r\n  _pounding_ and _grinding_; but Land may be so barren, that Plough or\r\n  Spade may not be sufficient to pulverize it to that Degree, which is\r\n  necessary to give it the same Fertility, that Pounding in a Mortar,\r\n  or grinding betwixt Marbles (as Colours are ground), can.\r\n\r\nI never myself try’d this way of pounding or grinding, because\r\nimpracticable in the Fields.\r\n\r\nBut I have had the Experience of a Multitude of Instances, which\r\nconfirm it so far, that I am in no Doubt, that any Soil[33] (be it\r\nrich or poor) can ever be made too fine by Tillage[34].\r\n\r\n  [33] Land that is too hollow and light, having no Cement to join its\r\n  Parts together, tho’ in Nature they are capable of infinite Division,\r\n  yet in Practice the Plough cannot divide them to any Purpose, unless\r\n  they were first join’d, but glides through without breaking them;\r\n  being more like to the primary Particles of Water against the Plough,\r\n  which are broken by no Force, than to Earth; it may be moved, but not\r\n  broken by Tillage, and therefore ought not to be reputed arable; nor\r\n  does it indeed deserve the Name of Land, but as the desart Sands of\r\n  _Lybia_, to distinguish it from Sea.\r\n\r\n  [34] According to some, this Rule is only general, and not universal;\r\n  for, say they, there’s a Sort of binding Gravel, that, when it is\r\n  made _fine_, will, by a sudden Dash of Rain, run together like a\r\n  Metal; and I have seen the same Accident in a particular Sort of\r\n  _white_ Land; but this very rarely happens to the latter: I never\r\n  knew it above once, and that was after Barley was sown on it; the\r\n  Hardness was only like a very thin Ice upon the Surface, which was\r\n  some Hindrance to the coming up of the Barley, until the Harrow’s\r\n  going over it once or twice broke that Ice or Crust, and then it came\r\n  up very well.\r\n\r\n  I never had any other Sort of Land liable to this Misfortune:\r\n  therefore can say nothing to the Gravel in that Case, nor how deep\r\n  the _Constipation_ may reach in it, nor what Remedy is most proper\r\n  to prevent the ill Consequence of it: But if there should be two\r\n  or three Exceptions out of _One thousand Seventy-nine Millions One\r\n  thousand and Sixty different Sorts of_ Earth (_see Mr. Evelyn’s\r\n  Terra_, p. 2), ’twill be no great Matter.\r\n\r\n  But I think these are no real Exceptions against any Degree of\r\n  _Pulverizing_; for it only shews, that some Sorts of Land, tho’ very\r\n  few, are subject by Accident to lose too soon their Pulveration: And\r\n  if the Fineness were no Benefit to that Land, such Loss of it would\r\n  be no Injury to it.\r\n\r\nFor ’tis without Dispute, that one cubical Foot of this minute Powder\r\nmay have more internal Superficies, than a thousand cubical Feet of the\r\nsame, or any other Earth till’d in the common Manner; and, I believe no\r\ntwo arable Earths in the World do exceed one another in their natural\r\nRichness Twenty Times; that is, one cubical Foot of the richest is not\r\nable to produce an equal Quantity of Vegetables, _cæteris paribus_, to\r\nTwenty cubical Feet of the poorest; therefore ’tis not strange, that\r\nthe poorest, when by pulverizing it has obtain’d One hundred Times the\r\ninternal Superficies of the rich untill’d Land, it should exceed it in\r\nFertility; or, if a Foot of the poorest was made to have Twenty Times\r\nthe Superficies of a Foot of such rich Land, the poorest might produce\r\nan equal Quantity of Vegetables with the rich[35]. Besides, there is\r\nanother extraordinary Advantage, when a Soil has a larger internal\r\nSuperficies in a very little Compass; for then the Roots of Plants in\r\nit are better supply’d with Nourishment, being nearer to them on all\r\nSides within Reach, than it can be when the Soil is less fine, as in\r\ncommon Tillage; and the Roots in the one must extend much further than\r\nin the other, to reach an equal Quantity of Nourishment: They must\r\nrange and fill perhaps above twenty Times more Space to collect the\r\nsame Quantity of Food.\r\n\r\n  [35] And very poor Land, well pulveriz’d, will produce better Corn\r\n  than very rich will do, without Manure or Tillage. The Experiment may\r\n  be made by paring off the Turf, and setting Corn in the whole Ground\r\n  that is very rich; and that will shew how much the natural Pasture\r\n  of the rich is inferior to the artificial Pasture of the poor Land;\r\n  but then the _poor_ must have this Proportion of Excess of internal\r\n  Superficies continued to it, during the whole Time of their Growth,\r\n  which cannot be done without frequently repeated Divisions of the\r\n  Soil by Hoeing or Manure; else it might require forty Times the\r\n  internal Superficies at the Time of Sowing, to keep twenty Times the\r\n  internal Superficies of the _rich_ till Harvest: For although the\r\n  rich is continually losing some of its artificial Pasture, as well as\r\n  the _poor_, yet by losing this equally, they still draw nearer and\r\n  nearer to the first Inequality of their natural Pasture.\r\n\r\n  But _poor_ Land, being lighter, has this Advantage, that it being\r\n  more _friable_ than the strong, requires less Labour to pulverize it;\r\n  and therefore the Expence of it is much less, than in proportion to\r\n  the Excess of Poorness of its internal Superficies.\r\n\r\nBut in this fine Soil, the most weak and tender Roots have free Passage\r\nto the utmost of their Extent, and have also an easy, due, and equal\r\nPressure every-where, as in Water.\r\n\r\nHard Ground makes a too great Resistance, as Air makes a too little\r\nResistance, to the Superficies of Roots.\r\n\r\nFarmers, just when they have brought their Land into a Condition fit to\r\nbe further till’d to much greater Advantage, leave off, supposing the\r\nSoil to be fine enough, when, with the Help of Harrows, they can cover\r\nthe Seed; and afterwards with a Roller they break the Clods; to the\r\nEnd that, if a Crop succeed, they may be able to mow it, without being\r\nhinder’d by those Clods: By what I could ever find, this Instrument,\r\ncall’d a Roller, is seldom beneficial to good Husbands; it rather\r\nuntills the Land, and anticipates the subsiding of the Ground, which in\r\nstrong Land happens too soon of itself[36].\r\n\r\n  [36] This Injury the Roller does, is only when tis used to press\r\n  down the Earth after the Seed is sown; and is the greater, if Land\r\n  be moist; but the Rolling of it in dry Weather, when ’tis to be\r\n  immediately plow’d up again, is the most speedy Way to pulverize the\r\n  Soil; and the Harrow is then very useful in pulling up the Clods, to\r\n  the End that the Roller may the better come at them to crush them.\r\n\r\nBut more to blame are they, who neglect to give their Land due Plowing,\r\ntrusting to the Harrow to make it fine; and when they have thrown in\r\ntheir Seed, go over it twenty Times with the Harrows[37] till the\r\nHorses have trodden it almost as hard as a Highway, which in moist\r\nWeather spoils the Crop; but on the contrary, the very Horses, when the\r\nEarth is moist, ought all to tread in the Furrows only, as in plowing\r\nwith a Hoe-Plough they always do, when they use it instead of a common\r\nPlough.\r\n\r\n  [37] _Nam veteres Romani dixerunt male subactum Agrum, qui satis\r\n  Frugibus occandus sit._\r\n\r\n  _Sed ut compluribus Iterationibus sic resolvatur vervactum\r\n  in Pulverem, ut nullam vel exiguam desideret Occationem, cum\r\n  seminaverimus. Col._ Lib. 2. Cap. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of_ HOEING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoeing is the breaking or dividing the Soil by Tillage, whilst the Corn\r\nor other Plants are growing thereon.\r\n\r\nIt differs from common Tillage (which is always perform’d before the\r\nCorn or Plants are sown or planted) in the Times of performing it; ’tis\r\nmuch more beneficial; and ’tis perform’d by different Instruments.\r\n\r\nLand that is before Sowing tilled never so much (tho’ the more ’tis\r\ntill’d the more it will produce) will have some Weeds, and they will\r\ncome in along with the Crop for a Share of the Benefit of the Tillage,\r\ngreater or less, according to their Number, and what Species they are\r\nof.\r\n\r\nBut what is most to be regarded is, that as soon as the Ploughman has\r\ndone his Work of plowing and harrowing, the Soil begins to undo it,\r\ninclining towards, and endeavouring to regain, its natural specific\r\nGravity; the broken Parts by little and little coalesce, unite, and\r\nlose some of their Surfaces; many of their Pores and Interstices close\r\nup during the Seed’s Incubation and Hatching in the Ground; and, as\r\nthe Plants grow up, they require an Increase of Food proportionable\r\nto their increasing Bulk; but on the contrary, instead thereof, that\r\ninternal Superficies, which is their artificial Pasture, gradually\r\ndecreases.\r\n\r\nThe Earth is so unjust to Plants, her own Off-spring, as to shut up\r\nher Stores in proportion to their Wants; that is, to give them less\r\nNourishment when they have need of more: Therefore Man, for whose Use\r\nthey are chiefly design’d, ought to bring in his reasonable Aid for\r\ntheir Relief, and force open her Magazines with the Hoe, which will\r\nthence procure them at all times Provisions in Abundance, and also free\r\nthem from Intruders; I mean, their spurious Kindred, the Weeds, that\r\nrobb’d them of their too scanty Allowance.\r\n\r\nThere’s no Doubt, but that one third Part of the Nourishment raised by\r\nDung and Tillage, given to Plants or Corn at many proper Seasons, and\r\napportion’d to the different Times of their Exigencies, will be of more\r\nBenefit to a Crop, than the Whole apply’d, as it commonly is, only at\r\nthe time of Sowing. This old Method is almost as unreasonable as if\r\nTreble the full Stock of Leaves, necessary to maintain Silk-worms till\r\nthey had finished their Spinning, should be given them before they are\r\nhatched, and no more afterwards.\r\n\r\nNext to Hoeing, and something like it, is Transplanting, but much\r\ninferior; both because it requires a so much greater Number of Hands,\r\nthat by no Contrivance can it ever become general, nor does it succeed,\r\nif often repeated; but Hoeing will maintain any Plant in the greatest\r\nVigour ’tis capable of, even unto the utmost Period of Age. Besides,\r\nthere is Danger in removing a whole Plant, and Loss of Time before the\r\nPlant can take Root again, all the former Roots being broken off at\r\nthe Ends in taking up (for ’tis impossible to do it without), and so\r\nmust wait until by the Strength and Virtue of its own Sap (which by a\r\ncontinual Perspiration is daily enfeebled) new Roots are form’d, which,\r\nunless the Earth continue moist[38], are so long in forming, that they\r\nnot only find a more difficult Reception into the closing Pores; but\r\nmany Times the Plant languishes and dies of an Atrophy, being starv’d\r\nin the midst of Plenty; but whilst this is thus decaying, the hoed\r\nPlant obtains a more flourishing State than ever, without removing from\r\nthe same Soil that produc’d it.\r\n\r\n  [38] But when the Earth doth continue moist, many transplanted\r\n  Vegetables thrive better than the same Species planted in Seeds,\r\n  because the former, striking Root sooner, have a greater Advantage\r\n  of the fresh-pulverized Mould, which loses some of its artificial\r\n  Pasture before the Seeds have Roots to reach it. The same Advantage\r\n  also have Seeds by soaking till ready to sprout before they are\r\n  planted. To both these the Moisture of the Earth is necessary.\r\n\r\n’Tis observ’d that some Plants are the worse for Transplanting[39].\r\n_Fenochia_ removed is never so good and tender as that which is not, it\r\nreceives such a Check in Transplanting in its Infancy; which, like the\r\nRickets, leaves Knots that indurate the Parts of the Fennel, and spoil\r\nit from being a Dainty.\r\n\r\n  [39] As most long Tap-rooted Plants are; for I have often try’d the\r\n  Transplanting of Plants, of _St. Foin_ and _Luserne_; and could never\r\n  find, that any ever came near to the Perfection that those will do\r\n  which are not removed, being equally single.\r\n\r\n  Tap-rooted Grasses and Turneps are always injured by Transplanting;\r\n  their long Root once broken off never arrives at the Depth it would\r\n  have arriv’d unbroken; as for this Reason they cut off the Tap-root\r\n  of an Apple-tree, to prevent its running downward, by which it would\r\n  have too much Moisture.\r\n\r\nHoeing has most of the Benefits without any Inconveniences of\r\nTransplanting; because it removes the Roots by little and little,\r\nand at different Times; some of the Roots remaining undisturb’d,\r\nalways supply the moved Roots with Moisture, and the whole Plant with\r\nNourishment sufficient to keep it from fainting, until the moved Roots\r\ncan enjoy the Benefit of their new Pasture, which is very soon.\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary Benefit of the new Hoeing[40] Husbandry is, that\r\nit keeps Plants moist in dry Weather, and this upon a double Account.\r\n\r\n  [40] Hoeing may be divided into Deep, which is our Horse-hoeing,\r\n  and Shallow, which is the English Hand-hoeing; and also the Shallow\r\n  Horse-hoeing, used in some Places betwixt Rows, where the Intervals\r\n  are very narrow, as sixteen or eighteen Inches; this is but an\r\n  Imitation of the Hand-hoe, or a _Succadaneum_ to it; and can neither\r\n  supply the Use of Dung, nor of Fallow, and may be properly called\r\n  Scratch-hoeing.\r\n\r\nFirst, as they are better nourished by Hoeing, they require less\r\nMoisture, as appears by Dr. _Woodward_’s Experiment, that those\r\nPlants which receive the greatest Increase, having most terrestrial\r\nNourishment, carry off the least Water in Proportion to their Augment:\r\nSo Barley or Oats, being sown on a Part of a Ground very well divided\r\nby Dung and Tillage, will come up and grow vigorously without Rain,\r\nwhen the same Grains, sown at the same Time, on the other Part, not\r\nthus enriched, will scarce come up; or, if they do, will not thrive\r\ntill Rain comes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, The Hoe, I mean the Horse-hoe (the other goes not deep\r\nenough), procures Moisture to the Roots from the Dews, which fall\r\nmost in dry Weather; and those Dews (by what Mr. _Thomas Henshaw_ has\r\nobserv’d) seem to be the richest Present the Atmosphere gives to the\r\nEarth; having, when putrefy’d in a Vessel, a black Sediment like Mud at\r\nthe Bottom. This seems to cause the darkish Colour to the upper Part of\r\nthe Ground. And the Sulphur, which is found in the Sediment of the Dew,\r\nmay be the chief Ingredient of the Cement of the Earth; Sulphur being\r\nvery glutinous, as Nitre is dissolvent. Dew has both these.\r\n\r\nThese enter in proportion to the Fineness and Freshness of the Soil,\r\nand to the Quantity that is so made fine and fresh by the Hoe. How\r\nthis comes to pass, and the Reason of it, are shewn in the Chapter of\r\nTillage.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate that Dews moisten the Land when fine, dig a Hole in the\r\nhard dry Ground, in the driest Weather, as deep as the Plough ought\r\nto reach: Beat the Earth very fine, and fill the Hole therewith; and,\r\nafter a few Nights Dews, you’ll find this fine Earth become moist at\r\nthe Bottom, and the hard Ground all round will continue dry.\r\n\r\nTill a Field in Lands; make one Land very fine by frequent deep\r\nPlowings; and let another be rough by insufficient Tillage,\r\nalternately; then plow the whole Field cross-ways in the driest\r\nWeather, which has continued long; and you will perceive, by the Colour\r\nof the Earth, that every fine Land will be turn’d up moist; but every\r\nrough Land will be dry as Powder, from Top to Bottom.\r\n\r\nAltho’ hard Ground, when thoroughly soak’d with Rain, will continue wet\r\nlonger than fine till’d Land adjoining to it; yet this Water serves\r\nrather to chill, than nourish the Plants standing therein, and to keep\r\nout the other Benefits of the Atmosphere, leaving the Ground still\r\nharder when ’tis thence exhaled; and being at last once become dry,\r\nit can admit no more Moisture, unless from a long-continued Deluge\r\nof Rain, which seldom falls till Winter, which is not the Season for\r\nVegetation.\r\n\r\nAs fine hoed Ground is not so long soaked by Rain, so the Dews never\r\nsuffer it to become perfectly dry: This appears by the Plants, which\r\nflourish and grow fat in this, whilst those in the hard Ground are\r\nstarved, except such of them, which stand near enough to the hoed[41]\r\nEarth, for the Roots to borrow Moisture and Nourishment from it.\r\n\r\n  [41] As when Wheat is drill’d late in very poor Land, so that in the\r\n  Spring the young Plants look all very yellow; let your Hoe-plough,\r\n  making a crooked Line, like an Indenture, on one Side of a strait Row\r\n  of this poor Wheat in the Spring, turn a Furrow from it; and in a\r\n  short time you will see all those yellow Plants, that are contiguous\r\n  to this Furrow, change their yellow Colour to a deep Green; whilst\r\n  those Plants of the same Row, which stand farthest off from this\r\n  indented Furrow, change not their Colour till afterwards; and all the\r\n  Plants change or retain their Colour sooner or later gradually, as\r\n  they stand nearer to, or farther from it; and the other Rows, which\r\n  have no Furrow near them, continue their yellow, after all this Row\r\n  is become green and flourishing: But this Experiment is best to be\r\n  made in poor sandy Ground, when the Mould is friable; else perhaps\r\n  the different Colour may not appear until the Furrow be turn’d back\r\n  to the Row, having lain some time to be somewhat pulveriz’d (or\r\n  impregnated) by the Weather, _&c._\r\n\r\n  This Experiment I often made on Wheat drill’d on the Level before I\r\n  drill’d any on Ridges.\r\n\r\n  The plowing one Furrow in sandy or mellow Ground makes a Pulveration,\r\n  which is enjoy’d first by these Plants that are the nearest to it;\r\n  and also delivers them from the Weeds, which, though there may be\r\n  very few, yet there is a vast difference between their robbing the\r\n  Wheat of its Pasture in the Row, and the Wheat’s enjoying both that\r\n  and the whole Pasture of the Furrow also.\r\n\r\n  I never remember to have seen a Plant poor, that was contiguous to a\r\n  well-hoed Interval, unless overpower’d by a too great Multitude of\r\n  other Plants; and the same Exception must be made, if it were a Plant\r\n  that required more or less Heat or Moisture, than the Soil or Climate\r\n  afforded.\r\n\r\nAnd I have been informed by some Persons, that they have often made\r\nthe like Observations; that, in the driest of Weather, good Hoeing[42]\r\nprocures Moisture to Roots; tho’ the Ignorant and Incurious fansy, it\r\nlets in the Drought; and therefore are afraid to hoe their Plants at\r\nsuch Times, when, unless they water them, they are spoil’d for Want of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n  [42] When Land is become hard by lying too long unho’d, the Plough in\r\n  turning a deep Furrow from each Side of a single Row of young Plants\r\n  (suppose of Turneps) may crack the Earth quite through the Row, and\r\n  expose the Roots to the open Air and Sun in very dry Weather; but if\r\n  the Earth wherein the Plants stand be fine, there will be no Cracks\r\n  in it: ’Tis therefore the delaying the Hoeing too long that occasions\r\n  the Injury. But to hoe with Advantage against dry Weather, the Ground\r\n  must have been well tilled or hoed before, that the Hoe may go deep,\r\n  else the Dews, that fall in the Night, will be exhal’d back in the\r\n  Heat of the Day.\r\n\r\nThere is yet one more Benefit Hoeing gives to Plants, which by no Art\r\ncan possibly be given to Animals: For all that can be done in feeding\r\nan Animal is, what has been here already said of Hoeing; that is, to\r\ngive it sufficient Food, Meat and Drink, at the times it has occasion\r\nfor them; if you give an Animal any more, ’tis to no manner of Purpose,\r\nunless you could give it more Mouths, which is impossible; but in\r\nhoeing a Plant the additional Nourishment thereby given, enables it\r\nto send out innumerable additional Fibres and Roots, as in one of the\r\nGlasses with a Mint in it, is seen; which fully demonstrates, that a\r\nPlant increaseth its Mouths, in some Proportion to the Increase of Food\r\ngiven to it: So that Hoeing, by the new Pasture it raises, furnishes\r\nboth Food and Mouths to Plants; and ’tis for Want of Hoeing, that so\r\nfew are brought to their Growth and Perfection[43].\r\n\r\n  [43] A Ground was drill’d with Ray-grass and Barley, in Rows at Five\r\n  Inches Distance from each other; it produced a pretty good Crop of\r\n  Ray-grass the second Year as is usual; there was adjoining to it a\r\n  Ground of Turneps, that were in Rows, with wide Intervals Horse-ho’d;\r\n  they stood for Seed; and amongst them there was, in Room of a Turnep,\r\n  a single Plant of Ray-grass, which, being hoed as the Turneps were,\r\n  had (in every one’s Opinion that saw it) acquired a Bulk at least\r\n  equal to a Thousand Plants of the same Species in the other Ground;\r\n  tho’ that vast Plant had no other Advantage above the other, except\r\n  its Singleness, and the deep Hoeing.\r\n\r\n  I have seen a Chickweed, by the same means, as much increas’d beyond\r\n  its common Size; and a Plant of Mustard-seed, whose collateral\r\n  Branches were much bigger than ever I saw a whole Plant of that Sort;\r\n  it was higher than I could reach its Top, and indeed more like a Tree\r\n  than an Herb; many other sorts of Plants have I seen thus increased\r\n  beyond what I had ever observ’d before, but none so much as those.\r\n\r\nIn what Manner the Sarrition of the Antients was performed in their\r\nCorn, is not very clear: This seems to have been their Method; _viz._\r\nWhen the Plants were some time come up, they harrowed the Ground,\r\nand pull’d out the Weeds by Hand. The Process of this appears in\r\n_Columella_, where he directs the Planting of _Medica_ to be but a\r\nSort of Harrowing or Raking amongst the young Plants, that the Weeds\r\nmight come out the more easily: _Ligneis Rastris statim jacta Semina\r\nobruantur_. _Post Sationem Ligneis Rastris Jarriendus, & identidem\r\nruncandus est Ager, ne alterius generis Herba invalidam Medicam\r\nperimat._\r\n\r\nThey harrowed and hoed _Rastris_; so that their _Occatio_ and\r\n_Sarritio_ were performed with much the same Sort of Instrument, and\r\ndiffered chiefly in the Time: The first was at Seed-time, to cover the\r\nSeed, or level the Ground; the other was to move the Ground after the\r\nPlants were up.\r\n\r\nOne Sort of their Sarrition was, _Segetes permota Terra debere adobrui,\r\nut fruticare possint_. Another Sort was thus: _In Locis autem frigidis\r\nsarriri nec adobrui, sed Plana Sarritione Terram permoveri_.\r\n\r\nFor the better Understanding of these two Sorts of Sarrition, we must\r\nconsider, that the Antients sowed their Corn under Furrow; that is,\r\nwhen they had harrowed the Ground, to break the Clods, and make it\r\nlevel, they sowed the Seed, and then plowed it in: This left the Ground\r\nvery uneven, and the Corn came up (as we see it does here in the same\r\nCase) mostly in the lowest Places betwixt the Furrows, which always lay\r\nhigher: This appears by _Virgil_’s _Cum Sulcos æquant Sata_. Now, when\r\nthey used _Plana Sarritio_, they harrowed Length-ways of the Furrows,\r\nwhich being somewhat harden’d, there could be little Earth thrown down\r\nthence upon the young Corn.\r\n\r\nBut the other Sort of Sarrition, whereby the Corn is said _Adobrui_, to\r\nbe cover’d, seems to be perform’d by Harrowing cross the Furrows; which\r\nmust needs throw down much Earth from the Furrows, which necessarily\r\nfell upon the Corn.\r\n\r\nHow this did contribute to make the Corn _fruticare_, is another\r\nQuestion: I am in no doubt to say, it was not from covering any Part of\r\nit (for I see that has a contrary Effect), but from moving much Ground,\r\nwhich gave a new Pasture to the Roots: This appears by the Observation\r\nof the extraordinary Frutication of Wheat ho’d without being cover’d;\r\nand by the Injury it receives by not being uncover’d when any Earth\r\nfalls on the Rows.\r\n\r\nThe same Author saith, _Faba, & cætera Legumina, cum quatuor Digitis à\r\nTerra extiterint, recte farrientur, excepto tamen Lupino, cujus Semini\r\ncontraria est Sarritio; quoniam unam Radicem habet, quæ sive Ferro\r\nsuccisa feu vulnerata est, totus Frutex emoritur_.\r\n\r\nIf they had ho’d it only betwixt Rows, there had been no Danger of\r\nkilling the Lupine, which is a Plant most proper for Hoeing. What he\r\nsays of the Lupine’s having no need of Sarrition, because it is able of\r\nitself to kill Weeds, shews the Antients were ignorant of the chief Use\r\nof Hoeing; _viz._ to raise new Nourishment by dividing the Earth, and\r\nmaking a new Internal Superficies in it.\r\n\r\nSarrition scratched and broke so small a Part of the Earth’s Surface,\r\namongst the Corn and Weeds, without Distinction, or favouring one any\r\nmore than the other, that it was a Dispute, whether the Good it did\r\nin facilitating the Runcation (or Hand-weeding) was greater, than\r\nthe Injury it did by bruising and tearing the Corn: And many of the\r\nAntients chose rather to content themselves with the Use of Runcation\r\nonly, and totally to omit all Sarrition of their Corn.\r\n\r\nBut Hoeing is an Action very different from that of Sarrition, and is\r\nevery Way beneficial, no-way injurious to Corn, tho’ destructive to\r\nWeeds. Therefore some modern Authors shew a profound Ignorance, in\r\ntranslating _Sarritio_, Hoeing: They give an Idea very different from\r\nthe true one: For the Antients truly hoed their Vineyards, but not\r\ntheir Corn; neither did they plant their Corn in Rows, without which\r\nthey could not give it the Vineyard-hoeing; Their Sarculation was\r\nused but amongst small Quantities of sown Corn, and is yet in Use for\r\nFlax; for I have seen the _Sarculum_ (which is a Sort of a very narrow\r\nHoe) used amongst the Plants of Flax standing irregularly: But this\r\nOperation is too tedious and too chargeable, to be apply’d to great\r\nQuantities of irregular Corn.\r\n\r\nIf they ho’d their Crops sown at Random, one would think they should\r\nhave made mad Work of it; since they were not at the Pains to plant in\r\nRows, and hoe betwixt them with their Bidens; being the Instrument with\r\nwhich they tilled many of their Vineyards, and enters as deep as the\r\nPlough, and is much better than the _English_ Hoe, which indeed seems,\r\nat the first Invention of it, to be designed rather to scrape Chimneys,\r\nthan to till the Ground.\r\n\r\nThe highest and lowest Vineyards are ho’d by the Plough; first the high\r\nVineyards, where the Vines grow (almost like Ivy) upon great Trees,\r\nsuch as Elms, Maples, Cherry-trees, _&c._ These are constantly kept\r\nin Tillage, and produce good Crops of Corn, besides what the Trees do\r\nyield; and also these great and constant Products of the Vines are\r\nowing to this Sort of Hoe-tillage; because neither in Meadow or Pasture\r\nGrounds can Vines be made to prosper; tho’ the Land be much richer, and\r\nyet have a less Quantity of Grass taken off it, than the Arable has\r\nCorn carried from that.\r\n\r\nThe Vines of low Vineyards[44], ho’d by the Plough, have their Heads\r\njust above the Ground, standing all in a most regular Order, and are\r\nconstantly plowed in the proper Season: These have no other Assistance,\r\nbut by Hoeing; because their Head and Roots are so near together, that\r\nDung would spoil the Taste of the Wine they produce, in hot Countries.\r\n\r\n  [44] From these I took my Vineyard Scheme, observing that indifferent\r\n  Land produces an annual Crop of Grapes and Wood without Dung; and\r\n  though there is annually carried off from an Acre of Vineyard, as\r\n  much in Substance as is carried off in the Crop of an Acre of Corn\r\n  produced on Land of equal Goodness; and yet the Vineyard Soil is\r\n  never impoverished, unless the hoeing Culture be denied it: But a few\r\n  annual Crops of Wheat, without Dung in the common Management, will\r\n  impoverish and emaciate the Soil.\r\n\r\n  The Vine indeed has the Advantage of being a large perennial Plant,\r\n  and of receiving some Part of its Nourishment below the Staple; but\r\n  it has also Disadvantages: The Soil of the Vineyard never can have\r\n  a true Summer Fallow, tho’ it has much Summer Hoeing; for the Vines\r\n  live in it, and all over it all the Year: neither can that Soil have\r\n  Benefit from Dung, because though by increasing the Pulveration,\r\n  it increases the Crop, yet it spoils the Taste of the Wine; the\r\n  Exhaustion of that Soil is therefore supply’d by no artificial Help\r\n  but Hoeing: And by all the Experience I have had of it, the same\r\n  Cause will have the same Effect upon a Soil for the Production of\r\n  Corn, and other Vegetables, as well as upon the Vineyard.\r\n\r\nAll Vineyards must be ho’d one Way or other[45], or else they will\r\nproduce nothing of Value; but Corn-Fields without Hoeing do produce\r\nsomething, tho’ nothing in Comparison to what they would do with it.\r\n\r\n  [45] Vines, that cannot be ho’d by the Ploughs, are ho’d by the\r\n  Bidens.\r\n\r\nMr. _Evelyn_ says, that when the Soil, wherein Fruit-Trees are planted,\r\nis constantly kept in Tillage, they grow up to be an Orchard in half\r\nthe Time they would do, if the Soil were not till’d; and this keeping\r\nan Orchard-Soil in Arable, is Horse-hoeing it.\r\n\r\nIn some Places in _Berkshire_ they have used, for a long time to\r\nHand-hoe most Sorts of Corn, with very great Success; and I may say\r\nthis, that I myself never knew, or heard, that ever any Crop of Corn\r\nwas properly so ho’d, but what very well answer’d the Expence, even of\r\nthis Hand-work; but be this never so profitable, there are not a Number\r\nof Hands to use it in great Quantities; which possibly was one Reason\r\nthe Antients were not able to introduce it into their Corn-Fields to\r\nany Purpose; tho’ they should not have been ignorant of the Effect of\r\nit, from what they saw it do in their Vineyards and Gardens.\r\n\r\nIn the next Place I shall give some general Directions, which by\r\nExperience I have found necessary to be known, in order to the Practice\r\nof this Hoeing-Husbandry.\r\n\r\n  I. _Concerning the Depth to plant at._\r\n\r\n  II. _The Quantity of Seed to plant._\r\n\r\n  III. _And the Distance of the Rows._\r\n\r\nI. ’Tis necessary to know how deep we may plant our Seed, without\r\nDanger of burying it; for so ’tis said to be, when laid at a Depth\r\nbelow what ’tis able to come up at.\r\n\r\nDifferent Sorts of Seeds come up at different Depths; some at six\r\nInches, or more; some at not more than half an Inch: The Way to know\r\nfor certain the Depth any Sort will come up at is, to make Gauges in\r\nthis Manner: Saw off 12 Sticks of about 3 Inches Diameter: Bore a Hole\r\nin the End of each Stick, and drive into it a taper Peg; let the first\r\nPeg be half an Inch long, the next an Inch, and so on; every Peg to be\r\nhalf an Inch longer than the former, till the last Peg be six Inches\r\nlong; then in that sort of Ground where you intend to plant, make a\r\nRow of Twenty Holes with the half-Inch Gauge; put therein Twenty good\r\nSeeds; cover them up, and stick the Gauge at the End of that Row; then\r\ndo the like with all the other Eleven Gauges: This will determine the\r\nDepth, at which the most Seeds will come up[46].\r\n\r\n  [46] In the common way of Sowing tis hard to know the proper Depth,\r\n  because some Seeds lying deep, and others shallow, it is not easy\r\n  to discover the Depth of those that are buried: But I have found in\r\n  drilling of black Oats, that when the Drill-Plough was set a little\r\n  deeper for Trial, very few came up: Therefore ’tis proper for the\r\n  Driller to use the Gauges for all Sorts of Seeds; for, if he drills\r\n  them too deep, he may lose his Crop; or, if too shallow, in dry\r\n  Weather, he may injure it, especially in Summer Seeds; but for those\r\n  planted against Winter, there is the most Damage by planting too deep.\r\n\r\nWhen the Depth is known, wherein the Seed is sure to come up, we may\r\neasily discover, whether the Seed be good or not, by observing how many\r\nwill fail: For in some Sorts of Seeds the Goodness cannot be known by\r\nthe Eye; and there has been often great Loss by bad Seed, as well as by\r\nburying good Seed; both which Misfortunes might be prevented by this\r\nlittle Trouble; besides ’tis not convenient to plant some sorts of Seed\r\nat the utmost Depth they will come up at; for it may be so deep, as\r\nthat the Wet may rot or chill the first Root, as in Wheat in moist Land.\r\n\r\nThe Nature of the Land, the Manner how it is laid, either flat, or in\r\nRidges, and the Season of Planting, with the Experience of the Planter,\r\nacquired by such Trials, must determine the proper Depths for different\r\nSorts of Seeds.\r\n\r\nII. The proper Quantity of Seed to be drill’d on an Acre, is much\r\nless than must be sown in the common Way; not because Hoeing will not\r\nmaintain as many Plants as the other; for, on the contrary, Experience\r\nshews it will, _cæteris paribus_, maintain more; but the Difference is\r\nupon many other Accounts: As that ’tis impossible to sow it so even by\r\nHand, as the Drill will do; for let the Hand spread it never so exactly\r\n(which is difficult to do some Seeds, especially in windy Weather), yet\r\nthe Unevenness of the Ground will alter the Situation of the Seed; the\r\ngreatest Part rebounding into the Holes, and lowest Places; or else\r\nthe Harrows, in Covering, draw it down thither; and tho’ these low\r\nPlaces may have Ten Times too much, the high Places may have little\r\nor none of it: This Inequality lessens, in Effect, the Quantity of\r\nthe Seed; because Fifty Seeds, in Room of One, will not produce so\r\nmuch as One will do; and where they are too thick, they cannot be well\r\nnourished, their Roots not spreading to near their natural Extent, for\r\nWant of Hoeing to open the Earth. Some Seed is buried (by which is\r\nmeant the laying them so deep, that they are never able to come up, as\r\n_Columella_ cautions, _Ut absque ulla Resurrectionis Spe sepeliantur_):\r\nSome lies naked above the Ground; which, with more uncovered by the\r\nfirst Rain, feeds the Birds and Vermin.\r\n\r\nFarmers know not the Depth that is enough to bury their Seed, neither\r\ndo they make much Difference in the Quantity they sow on a rough, or a\r\nfine Acre; tho’ the same that is too little for the one, is too much\r\nfor the other; ’tis all mere Chance-work, and they put their whole\r\nTrust in good Ground, and much Dung, to cover their Errors.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Quantity of Seed I ever heard of to be usually sown, is in\r\n_Wiltshire_, where I am informed by the Owners themselves, that on some\r\nSorts of Land they sow Eight Bushels of Barley to an Acre; so that if\r\nit produce four Quarters to an Acre, there are but four Grains for one\r\nthat is sown, and is a very poor Increase, tho’ a good Crop; this is on\r\nLand plowed once, and then double-dung’d, the Seed only harrow’d into\r\nthe stale and hard Ground[47]; ’tis like not two Bushels of the eight\r\nwill enter it to grow; and I have heard, that in a dry Summer an Acre\r\nof this scarce produces four Bushels at Harvest.\r\n\r\n  [47] Stale Ground is that which has lain some considerable time\r\n  after Plowing, before it is sown, contrary to that which is sown\r\n  immediately after plow’d; for this last is generally not so hard as\r\n  the former.\r\n\r\nBut, in Drilling, Seed lies all the same just Depth, none deeper, nor\r\nshallower, than the rest; here’s no Danger of the Accidents of burying,\r\nor being uncover’d, and therefore no Allowance must be made for them;\r\nbut Allowance must be made for other Accidents, where the Sort of Seed\r\nis liable to them; such as Grub, Fly, Worm, Frost, _&c._\r\n\r\nNext, when a Man unexperienced in this Method has proved the Goodness\r\nof his Seed, and Depth to plant at it, he ought to calculate what\r\nNumber of Seeds a Bushel, or other Measure or Weight, contains: For one\r\nBushel or one Pound of small Seed, may contain double the Number of\r\nSeeds, of a Bushel, or a Pound, of large Seed of the same Species.\r\n\r\nThis Calculation is made by weighing an Ounce, and counting the Number\r\nof Seeds therein; then weighing a Bushel of it, and multiplying the\r\nNumber of Seeds of the Ounce, by the Number of Ounces of the Bushel’s\r\nWeight; the Product will shew the Number of Seeds of a Bushel near\r\nenough: Then, by the Rule of Three, apportion them to the Square Feet\r\nof an Acre; or else it may be done, by divideing the Seeds of the\r\nBushel by the Square Feet of an Acre; the Quotient will give the Number\r\nof Seeds for every Foot: Also consider how near you intend to plant the\r\nRows, and whether Single, Double, Treble, or Quadruple; for the more\r\nRows, the more Seed will be required[48].\r\n\r\n  [48] The narrow Spaces (suppose seven Inches) betwixt Double, Treble,\r\n  or Quadruple Rows, the Double having One, the Treble Two, and the\r\n  Quadruple Three of them, are called _Partitions_.\r\n\r\n  The wide Space (suppose of near five Feet) betwixt any Two of these\r\n  Double, Treble, or Quadruple Rows, is call’d an _Interval_.\r\n\r\nExamine what is the Produce of one middle-siz’d Plant of the Annual,\r\nbut the Produce of the best and largest of the perennial Sort; because\r\nthat by Hoeing will be brought to its utmost Perfection: Proportion the\r\nSeed of both to the reasonable Product; and, when ’tis worth while,\r\nadjust the Plants to their competent Number with the Hand-hoe, after\r\nthey are up; and plant Perennials generally in single Rows: Lastly,\r\nPlant some Rows of the Annual thicker than others, which will soon give\r\nyou Experience (better than any other Rule) to know the exact Quantity\r\nof Seed to drill.\r\n\r\nIII. The Distances of the Rows are one of the most material Points,\r\nwherein we shall find many apparent Objections against the Truth; of\r\nwhich, tho’ full Experience be the most infallible Proof, yet the\r\nWorld is by false Notions so prejudiced against wide Spaces between\r\nRows, that unless these common (and I wish I could say, only vulgar)\r\nObjections be first answer’d, perhaps no-body will venture so far out\r\nof the old Road, as is necessary to gain the Experience; without it be\r\nsuch as have seen it.\r\n\r\nI formerly was at much Pains, and at some Charge, in improving my\r\nDrills, for planting the Rows at very near Distances; and had brought\r\nthem to such Perfection, that One Horse would draw a Drill with Eleven\r\nShares, making the Rows at three Inches and half Distance from one\r\nanother; and at the same Time sow in them Three very different Sorts of\r\nSeeds, which did not mix; and these too, at different Depths; as the\r\nBarley-Rows were seven Inches asunder, the Barley lay four Inches deep;\r\na little more than three Inches above that, in the same Chanels, was\r\nClover; betwixt every Two of these Rows was a Row of St. Foin, cover’d\r\nhalf an Inch deep.\r\n\r\nI had a good Crop of Barley the first Year; the next Year, Two Crops\r\nof Broad-Clover, where that was sown; and where Hop-Clover was sown,\r\na mix’d Crop of That and St. Foin, and every Year afterwards a Crop\r\nof St. Foin; but I am since, by Experience, so fully convinced of the\r\nFolly of these, or any other such mix’d Crops, and more especially\r\nof narrow Spaces, that I have demolish’d these Instruments (in their\r\nfull Perfection) as a vain Curiosity, the Drift and Use of them being\r\ncontrary to the true Principles and Practice of Horse-Hoeing.\r\n\r\nAltho’ I am satisfied, that every one, who shall have seen as much of\r\nit as I have, will be of my Mind in this Matter; yet I am aware, that\r\nwhat I am going to advance, will seem shocking to them, before they\r\nhave made Trials.\r\n\r\nI lay it down as a Rule (to myself) that every Row of Vegetables, to be\r\nHorse-ho’d, ought to have an empty Space or Interval of thirty Inches\r\non one Side of it[49] at least, and of near five Feet in all Sorts of\r\nCorn.\r\n\r\n  [49] _Note_, We call it one Row, tho’ it be a Double, Treble, or\r\n  Quadruple Row; because when they unite in the Spring, they seem to be\r\n  all single; even the Quadruple then is but as one single Row.\r\n\r\n  Observe, that as wide Intervals are necessary for perfect\r\n  Horse-hoeing, so the largest Vegetables have generally the greatest\r\n  Benefit by them; tho’ small Plants may have considerable Benefit from\r\n  much narrower Intervals than Five Feet.\r\n\r\n  The Intervals may be somewhat narrower for constant annual Crops\r\n  of Barley, than of Wheat; because Barley does not shut out the\r\n  Hoe-Plough so soon, nor require so much Room for Hoeing, nor so much\r\n  Earth in the Intervals, it being a lesser Plant, and growing but\r\n  about a Third-part of the Time on the Ground; but he that drills\r\n  Barley, must resolve to reap it, and bind it up in Sheaves; for if\r\n  he mows it, or does not bind it, a great Part will be lost among the\r\n  Earth in the Intervals: But ’tis now found, that in a wet Harvest\r\n  the best Way is not to bind up drill’d Barley or Oats; but instead\r\n  thereof, to make up the Grips into little Heaps by Hands, laying the\r\n  Ears upon one another inwards, and the Stubble-ones outwards; so that\r\n  with a Fork that hath Two Fingers, and a Thumb, ’tis very easy to\r\n  pitch such Heaps up the Waggons without scattering, or wasting any of\r\n  the Corn.\r\n\r\n  ’Tis also seen, that when the Reapers take Care to set their Grips\r\n  with the But-ends in the Bottoms of the Intervals, and the Ears\r\n  properly on the Stubble, they will so stand up from the Ground, as to\r\n  escape much better from sprouting, than mow’d Corn.\r\n\r\nIn Hand-hoeing there is always less Seed, fewer Plants, and a greater\r\nCrop, _cæteris paribus_, than in the common Sowing: Yet there, the Rows\r\nmust be much nearer together, than in Horse-hoeing; because as the Hand\r\nmoves many times less Earth than the Horse, the Roots will be sent out\r\nin like Proportion; and if the Spaces or Intervals, where the Hand-hoe\r\nonly scratches a little of the upper Surface of them, should be wide,\r\nthey would be so hard and stale underneath, that the Roots of perennial\r\nPlants would be long in running thro’ them; and the Roots of many\r\nannual Plants would never be able to do it.\r\n\r\nAn Instance which shews something of the Difference between Hand-hoeing\r\nand Deep-hoeing is, That a certain poor Man is observ’d to have his\r\nCabbages vastly bigger than any-body’s else, tho’ their Ground be\r\nricher, and better dung’d: His Neighbours were amaz’d at it, till the\r\nSecret at length came out, and was only this: As other People ho’d\r\ntheir Cabbages with a Hand-hoe, he instead thereof dug his with a\r\nSpade: And nothing can more nearly equal[50] the Use of the Horse-hoe\r\nthan the Spade does.\r\n\r\n  [50] The Hoe-plough exceeds the Spade in this Respect, that it\r\n  removes more of the Roots, and cuts off fewer; which is an Advantage\r\n  when we till near to the Bodies of Plants that are grown large.\r\n\r\nAnd when the Plants have never so much _Pabulum_ near them, their\r\nfibrous Roots cannot reach it all, before the Earth naturally excludes\r\nthem from it; for, to reach it all, they must fill all the Pores[51],\r\nwhich is impossible: So far otherwise it is, that we shall find it\r\nprobable, that they can only reach the least Part of it, unless the\r\nRoots could remove themselves from Place to Place, to leave such\r\nPores as they had exhausted, and apply themselves to such as were\r\nunexhausted; but they not being endow’d with Parts necessary for local\r\nMotion (as Animals are), the Hoe-Plough suplies their Want of Feet;\r\nand both conveys them to their Food, and their Food to them, as well\r\nas provides it for them; for by transplanting the Roots, it gives them\r\nChange of the Pasture, which it increases by the very Act of changing\r\nthem from one Situation to another, if the Intervals be wide enough for\r\nthis Hoeing Operation to be properly perform’d.\r\n\r\n  [51] The Roots of a Mint, set a whole Summer in a Glass, kept\r\n  constantly replenished with Water, will, in Appearance, fill the\r\n  whole Cavity of the Glass; but by compressing the Roots, or by\r\n  observing how much Water the Glass will hold when the Roots are in\r\n  it, we are convinc’d, that they do not fill a Fourth-part of its\r\n  Cavity; tho’ they are not stopp’d by Water, as they are by Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Objections most likely to prepossess Peoples Minds, and prevent\r\ntheir making Trials of this Husbandry, are these:\r\n\r\nFirst, they will be apt to think, that these wide, naked Spaces, not\r\nbeing cover’d by the Plants, will not be sufficient to make a good Crop.\r\n\r\nFor Answer, we must consider, that tho’ Corn, standing irregular and\r\n_sparsim_, may seem to cover the Ground better than when it stands\r\nregular in Rows; this Appearance[52] is a mere _Deceptio visus_; for\r\nStalks are never so thick on any Part of the Ground as where many come\r\nout of one Plant, or as when they stand in a Row; and a ho’d Plant of\r\nCorn will have Twenty or Thirty Stalks[53], in the same Quantity of\r\nGround where an unho’d Plant, being equally single, will have only\r\nTwo or Three Stalks. These tillered ho’d Stalks, if they were planted\r\n_sparsim_ all over the Interval, it might seem well cover’d, and\r\nperhaps thicker than the sown Crop commonly is; so that tho’ these\r\nho’d Rows seem to contain a less Crop, they may contain, in reality, a\r\ngreater Crop than the sown, that seems to exceed it; and ’tis only the\r\ndifferent Placing that makes one seem greater, and the other less, than\r\nit really is; and this is only when both Crops are young.\r\n\r\n  [52] For the Eye to make a Companion betwixt a sown Crop and such\r\n  a ho’d Crop, it ought, when ’tis half grown, to look on the ho’d\r\n  Crop across the Rows; because in the other it does so, in Effect,\r\n  which way soever it looks; but whatever Appearance the ho’d Crop of\r\n  Vegetables (of as large a Species as Wheat) makes when young, it\r\n  surely, if well managed, appears more beautiful at Harvest than a\r\n  sown Crop.\r\n\r\n  [53] I have counted Fifty large Ears on one single ho’d Plant of\r\n  Barley.\r\n\r\nThe next Objection is, That the Space or Interval not being _planted_,\r\nmuch of the Benefit of that Ground will be lost; and therefore the Crop\r\nmust be less than if it were planted all over.\r\n\r\nI answer, It might be so, if not Horse-ho’d; but if well Horse-ho’d,\r\nthe Roots can run through the Intervals; and, having more Nourishment,\r\nmake a greater Crop.\r\n\r\nThe too great Number of Plants, plac’d all over the Ground in common\r\nsowing, have, whilst it is open, an Opportunity of _wasting_, when they\r\nare very young, that Stock of Provision, for Want of which the greatest\r\nPart of them are afterwards starv’d; for their irregular Standing\r\nprevents their being relieved with fresh Supplies from the Hoe: Hence\r\nit is, that the old Method exhausting the Earth to no Purpose, produces\r\na less Crop; and yet leaves less _Pabulum_ behind for a succeeding one,\r\ncontrary to the Hoeing-Husbandry, wherein Plants are manag’d in all\r\nRespects by a quite different Oeconomy.\r\n\r\nIn a large Ground of Wheat it was prov’d, that the widest ho’d\r\nIntervals brought the greatest Crop of all: Dung without Hoeing did not\r\nequal Hoeing without Dung. And what was most remarkable, amongst Twelve\r\nDifferences of wider and narrower Spaces, more and less ho’d, dung’d\r\nand undung’d, the Hand-sow’d was considerably the worst of all; tho’\r\nall the Winter and Beginning of the Spring, that made infinitely the\r\nmost promising Appearance; but at Harvest yielded but about One-fifth\r\nPart of Wheat of that which was most hoed; there was some of the most\r\nhoed, which yielded Eighteen Ounces of clean Wheat in a Yard in Length\r\nof a double Row, the Intervals being thirty Inches, and the Partition\r\nSix Inches[54].\r\n\r\n  [54] The same Harvest, a Yard in Length of a double Row of Barley,\r\n  having Six Inches Partition, produc’d Eight hundred and Eighty Ears\r\n  in a Garden; but the Grains happened to be eaten by Poultry before\r\n  ’twas ripe, so that their Produce of Grains could not be known: One\r\n  like Yard of a ho’d Row of Wheat, in an undung’d Field, produc’d Four\r\n  hundred Ears of Lammas-Wheat.\r\n\r\nA Third Objection like the two former is, that so small a Part of the\r\nGround, as that whereon the Row stands, cannot contain Plants or Stalks\r\nsufficient for a full Crop.\r\n\r\nThis some Authors endeavour to support by Arguments taken from the\r\nperpendicular Growth of Vegetables, and the Room they require to stand\r\non; both which having answer’d elsewhere, I need not say much of them\r\nhere; only I may add, that if Plants could be brought to as great\r\nPerfection, and so to stand as thick all over the Land, as they do in\r\nthe ho’d Rows, there might be produced, at once, many of the greatest\r\nCrops of Corn that ever grew.\r\n\r\nBut since Plants thrive, and make their Produce, in Proportion to the\r\nNourishment they have within the Ground, not to the Room they have\r\nto stand upon it, one very narrow Row may contain more Plants than a\r\nwide Interval can nourish, and bring to their full Perfection, by all\r\nthe Art that can be used; and ’tis impossible a Crop should be lost\r\nfor want of room to stand above the Ground, tho’ it were less than a\r\nTenth-part of the Surface[55].\r\n\r\n  [55] Mr. _Houghton_ calculates, that a Crop of Wheat of Thirty\r\n  Quarters to an Acre, each Ear has two Inches and a Half of Surface;\r\n  by which ’tis evident, that there would be Room for many such\r\n  prodigious Crops to stand on.\r\n\r\n  And a Quick-hedge, standing between two Arable Grounds, one Foot\r\n  broad at Bottom, and Eighteen Feet in Length, will, at fourteen Years\r\n  Growth, produce more of the same Sort of Wood, than eighteen Feet\r\n  square of a Coppice will produce in the same Time, the Soil of both\r\n  being of equal Goodness.\r\n\r\n  This seems to be the same Case with our ho’d Rows; the Coppice, if\r\n  it were to be cut in the first Years, would yield perhaps ten Times\r\n  as much Wood, as the Hedge; but many of the Shoots of the Coppice\r\n  constantly die every Year, for Want of sufficient Nourishment, until\r\n  the Coppice is fit to be cut; and then its Product is much less than\r\n  that of the Hedge, whose Pasture has not been over-stock’d to such\r\n  a Degree as the Coppice-Pasture has been; and therefore brings its\r\n  Crop of Wood to greater Perfection than the Coppice-Wood, which has\r\n  Eighteen Times the Surface of Ground to stand on; The Hedge has the\r\n  Benefit of Hoeing, as oft as the Land on either Side of it is till’d;\r\n  but the Coppice, like the sown Corn, wants that Benefit.\r\n\r\nIn wide Intervals there is another Advantage of Hoeing, I mean\r\nHorse-hoeing (the other being more like Scratching and Scraping than\r\nHoeing): There is room for many Hoeings[56], which must not come very\r\nnear the Bodies of some annual Plants, except whilst they are young;\r\nbut in narrow Intervals, this cannot be avoided at every Hoeing:\r\n’Tis true, that in the last Hoeings, even in the middle of a large\r\nInterval, many of the Roots may be broken off by the Hoe-plough, at\r\nsome considerable Distance from the Bodies; but yet this is no Damage,\r\nfor they send out a greater Number of Roots than before; as in Chap. I.\r\nappears.\r\n\r\n  [56] Many Hoeings; but if it should be asked how many, we may take\r\n  _Columella_’s Rule in hoeing the Vines, _viz._ _Numerus autem\r\n  vertendi Soli (bidentibus) definiendus non est, cum quanto crebrior\r\n  fit, plus prodesse fossionem conveniat. Sed impersarum Ratio modum\r\n  postulat_. Lib. 4. Cap. 5.\r\n\r\n  Neither is it altogether the Number of Hoeings that determines the\r\n  Degrees of Pulveration: For, Once well done, is Twice done; and the\r\n  oftener the better, if the Expence be not excessive.\r\n\r\n  Poor Land, be it never so light, should have the most Hoeings;\r\n  because Plants, receiving but very little Nourishment from the\r\n  natural Pasture of such Land, require the more artificial Pasture to\r\n  subsist on.\r\n\r\nIn wide Intervals, those Roots are broken off only where they are\r\nsmall; for tho’ they are capable of running out to more than the Length\r\nof the external Parts of a Plant; yet ’tis not necessary they should\r\nalways do so; if they can have sufficient Food nearer to the Bodies[57]\r\nof the Plants.\r\n\r\n  [57] All the Mould is never so near to the Bodies of Plants, as ’tis\r\n  when the Row stands on a high Six-feet Ridge, when the middle of the\r\n  Interval is left bare of Earth, at the last Hoeing; for then all the\r\n  Mould may be but about a Foot, or a Foot and half, distant from the\r\n  Body of each Plant of a Treble Row.\r\n\r\nAnd these new, young, multiply’d Roots are fuller of Lacteal Mouths\r\nthan the older ones; which makes it no Wonder, that Plants should\r\nthrive faster by having some of their Roots broken off by the Hoe; for\r\nas Roots do not enter every Pore of the Earth, but miss great Part\r\nof the Pasture, which is left unexhausted, so when new Roots strike\r\nout from the broken Parts of the old, they meet with that Pasture,\r\nwhich their Predecessors miss’d, besides that new Pasture which the\r\nHoe raises for them; and those Roots which the Hoe pulls out without\r\nbreaking, and covers again, are turn’d into a fresh Pasture; some\r\nbroken, and some unbroken: All together invigorate the Plants.\r\n\r\nBesides, the Plants of sown Corn, being treble in Number to those of\r\nthe drill’d, and of equal Strength and Bulk, whilst they are very\r\nyoung, must exhaust the Earth whilst it is open, thrice as much as the\r\ndrill’d Plants do; and before the sown Plants grow large, the Pores\r\nof the Earth are shut against them, and against the Benefit of the\r\nAtmosphere; but for the drill’d, the Hoe gives constant Admission to\r\nthat Benefit; and if the Hoe procures them (by dividing the Earth) Four\r\nTimes the Pasture of the sown during their Lives, and the Roots devour\r\nbut one half of that, then tho’ the ho’d Crop should be double to the\r\nsown, yet it might leave twice as much _Pabulum_ for a succeeding Crop.\r\n’Tis impossible to bring these Calculations to Mathematical Rules;\r\nbut this is certain in Practice, that a sown Crop, succeeding a large\r\nundung’d ho’d Crop, is much better than a sown Crop, that succeeds a\r\nsmall dung’d sown Crop. And I have the Experience of poor, worn out\r\nHeath-ground, that, having produc’d Four successive good ho’d Crops of\r\nPotatoes (the last still best), is become tolerable good Ground.\r\n\r\nIn a very poor Field were planted Potatoes, and, in the very worst Part\r\nof it, several Lands had them in Squares a Yard asunder; these were\r\nplowed four ways at different times: Some other Lands adjoining to\r\nthem, of the very same Ground, were very well dung’d and till’d; but\r\nthe Potatoes came irregularly, in some Places thicker, and in others\r\nthinner: These were not ho’d, and yet, at first coming up, looked\r\nblacker and stronger than those in Squares not dung’d, either that\r\nYear, or ever, that I know of; yet these Lands brought a good Crop of\r\nthe largest Potatoes, and very few small ones amongst them; but in the\r\ndung’d Lands, for Want of Hoeing, the Potatoes were not worth the\r\ntaking up; which proves, that in those Plants that are planted so as to\r\nleave Spaces wide enough for Repetitions of Hoeing, that Instrument can\r\nraise more Nourishment to them, than a good Coat of Dung with common\r\nTillage.\r\n\r\nAnother Thing I have more particularly observ’d, _viz._ That the more\r\nsuccessive Crops are planted in wide Intervals, and often ho’d, the\r\nbetter the Ground does maintain them; the last Crop is still the best,\r\nwithout Dung, or changing the Sort of Plant; and this is visible in\r\nParts of the same Field, where some Part has a first, some other Part\r\na second, the rest a third Crop growing all together at the same time;\r\nwhich seems to prove, that as the Earth is made by this Operation to\r\ndispense or distribute her Wealth to Plants, in Proportion to the\r\nIncrease of her inner Superficies (which is the Pasture of Plants);\r\nso the Atmosphere, by the Riches in Rain and Dews, does annually\r\nreimburse her in Proportion to the same Superficies, with an Overplus\r\nfor Interest: But if that Superficies be not increased to a competent\r\nDegree, and, by frequent Repetitions of Hoeing, kept increasing (which\r\nnever happens in common Husbandry) this Advantage is lost; and, without\r\noften repeated Stercoration, every Year’s Crop grows worse; and it\r\nhas been made evident by Trials, which admit of no Dispute, that\r\nHoeing, without Dung or Fallow, can make such Plants as stand in wide\r\nIntervals, more vigorous in the same Ground, than both common Dunging\r\nand Fallowing can do without Hoeing.\r\n\r\nThis Sort of Hoeing has in Truth every Year the Effect of a\r\nSummer-fallow; tho’ it yearly produce a good Crop.\r\n\r\nThis is one Reason of the different Effects Plants have upon the Soil;\r\nsome are said to enrich it, others to burn it, _i. e._ to impoverish\r\nit; but I think it may be observed, that all those Plants, which are\r\nusually ho’d, are reckoned among the Enrichers; and tho’ it be certain\r\nthat some Species of Plants are, by the Heat of their Constitution,\r\ngreater Devourers than those of another Species of equal Bulk; yet\r\nthere is Reason to believe, that were the most cormorant Plant of\r\nthem all to be commonly ho’d, it would gain[58] the Reputation of an\r\nEnricher or Improver of the Soil; except it should be such, as might\r\noccasion Trouble, by filling it full of its shatter’d Seeds, which\r\nmight do the Injury of Weeds to the next Crop; and except such Plants,\r\nwhich have a vast Bulk to be maintained a long Time, as Turnep-Seed[59].\r\n\r\n  [58] But this must be intended of the deep Horse-hoeing; for Turneps\r\n  that stand for Seed, are such Devourers, and feed so long on the\r\n  Soil, that tho’ they are Hand-ho’d, such a shallow Operation doth not\r\n  supply the usual Thickness of those Plants with Pasture sufficient\r\n  to raise their Stems to half their natural Bulk; and they leave so\r\n  little of that Pasture behind them, that the Soil is observ’d to be\r\n  extremely impoverished for a Year or two, and sometimes three Years\r\n  after them; but ’tis otherwise with my Horse-ho’d Turnep-Seed; for\r\n  I never fail’d of a good Crop of Barley after it, sown on the Level\r\n  in the following Spring, tho’ no Dung hath been used on the Land\r\n  where the Turnep-Seed grew for many Years. And also my Barley Crops\r\n  thus sown after two successive Crops of Turnep-Seed without a Fallow\r\n  between them, are as good as those sown after a single Crop of it.\r\n  For I have several Times made these Turnep-Seed Crops annual, that\r\n  is, to have Two Crops of it in Two Years, which would in the old Way\r\n  require three Years, because this Crop stands about a Year on the\r\n  Ground, and is not ripe till Midsummer, which is too late to get\r\n  that Land into a Tilth proper to plant another Seed Crop on it the\r\n  same Summer; neither can the Soil be able to bear such another Crop\r\n  immediately after being so much exhausted, and unplowed for a whole\r\n  Year, except it be extraordinary rich, or much dunged: However, Two\r\n  Crops of Turnep-Seed immediately succeeding one another, is what I\r\n  never knew, or heard of, except my own that were Horse-ho’d; and of\r\n  these the second Crop was as good as the first; their Stalks grew\r\n  much higher than they usually do in the common Way; and tho’ the\r\n  Number of Plants was much less, their Produce was so valuable, that\r\n  the _Vicar’s Agent_ declared, he made Twenty Shillings _per_ Acre of\r\n  his Tythe of a whole Field which he tythed in Kind. The Expence of\r\n  these Crops was judg’d to be answered by the Fuel of the thresh’d\r\n  Stalks. It must be noted, that the extraordinary Value of these Crops\r\n  arose, not from a greater Quantity of Seed than some common Crops;\r\n  but from their Quality, Experience having brought this Seed into\r\n  great Esteem, on account of its being perfectly clean, and produced\r\n  by large Turneps of a good Sort, and of a proper Shape; for those\r\n  that are not well cultivated are very apt to degenerate, and then\r\n  their Seed will produce Turneps of a small Size, and of a long rapy\r\n  ill Shape.\r\n\r\n  [59] Turneps run to Seed, not till the second Summer.\r\n\r\nThe wider the Intervals are, the more Earth may be divided; for the Row\r\ntakes up the same Room with a wide, or a narrow Interval; and therefore\r\nwith the wide, the unho’d Part bears a less Proportion to the ho’d Part\r\nthan in the narrow.\r\n\r\nAnd ’tis no Purpose to hoe, where there is not Earth to be ho’d, or\r\nRoom to hoe it in.\r\n\r\nThere are many Ways of Hoeing with the Hoe-Plough; but there is not\r\nRoom to turn Two deep clean Furrows in an Interval that is narrower\r\nthan Four Feet Eight Inches; for if it want much of this Breadth, one,\r\nat least, of these Furrows, will reach, and fall upon the next Row,\r\nwhich will be very injurious to the Plants; except of grown St. Foin,\r\nand such other Plants, that can bear to have the Earth pull’d off them\r\nby Harrows.\r\n\r\nThus much of Hoeing in general may suffice: And different Sorts of\r\nPlants requiring different Management; that may more properly be\r\ndescribed in the Chapter, where particular Vegetables are treated of.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to add, that all Sorts of Land are not equally\r\nproper for Hoeing: I take it, that a dry friable Soil is the best.\r\nIntractable wet Clays, and such Hills as are too steep for Cattle to\r\ndraw a Plough up and down them, are the most improper[60].\r\n\r\n  [60] For by hoeing cross the Hill, the Furrow turn’d against the\r\n  Declivity cannot be thrown up near enough to the Row above it; and\r\n  the Furrow that is turn’d downwards will bury the Row below it.\r\n\r\nThat ’tis not so beneficial to hoe in Common-fields, is not in Respect\r\nof the Soil, but to the old Principles, which have bound the Owners\r\nto unreasonable Customs of changing the Species of Corn, and make it\r\nnecessary to fallow every Second, Third, or Fourth Year at farthest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of_ WEEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants, that come up in any Land, of a different Kind from the sown or\r\nplanted Crop, are Weeds.\r\n\r\nThat there are in Nature any such things as _inutiles Herbæ_, the\r\nBotanists deny; and justly too, according to their Meaning.\r\n\r\nBut the Farmer, who expects to make Profit of his Land from what\r\nhe sows or plants in it, finds not only _Herbæ inutiles_, but also\r\n_noxiæ_, unprofitable and hurtful Weeds; which come like _Muscæ_,\r\nor uninvited Guests, that always hurt, and often spoil his Crop, by\r\ndevouring what he has, by his Labour in Dunging and Tilling, provided\r\nfor its Sustenance.\r\n\r\nAll Weeds, as such, are pernicious; but some much more than others;\r\nsome do more Injury, and are more easily destroy’d; some do less\r\nInjury, and are harder to kill; others there are, which have both these\r\nbad Qualities. The hardest to kill are such as will grow and propagate\r\nby their Seed, and also by every Piece of their Roots, as Couch-grass,\r\nColtsfoot, Melilot, Fern, and such-like. Some are hurtful only by\r\nrobbing legitimate (or sown) Plants of their Nourishment, as all Weeds\r\ndo; others both lessen a legitimate Crop by robbing it, and also spoil\r\nthat Crop, which escapes their Rapine, when they infect it with their\r\nnauseous Scent and Relish, as Melilot, wild Garlick, _&c._\r\n\r\nWeeds starve the sown Plants, by robbing them of their Provision of\r\nFood[61], not of their Room (as some Authors vainly imagine); which\r\nwill appear by the following Experiment.\r\n\r\n  [61] A Tree of any Sort will spoil Corn all round it, in a large\r\n  Circle; half an Acre of Turneps has been spoil’d by one: Hereby ’tis\r\n  plain, that Trees rob as Weeds; because ’tis not by their Shadow,\r\n  there being as much Damage done by them on the South-Side, where\r\n  their Shadow never comes, as on their North-Side: Nor can it be by\r\n  their dropping; for ’tis the same on the Side where a Tree has no\r\n  Boughs to drop over the Plants, when they are also at a very great\r\n  Distance from all Parts of the Tree, except its Roots.\r\n\r\nLet three Beds of the same Soil, equal, and equally prepared, be sown\r\nwith the same Sort of Corn. Let the first of these Beds be kept clean\r\nfrom Weeds: In the Second, let a Quantity of Weeds grow along with the\r\nCorn; and in the Third, stick up a Quantity of dead Sticks, greater in\r\nBulk than the Weeds.\r\n\r\nIt will be found, that the Produce of the Corn in the First will not\r\nexceed that of the Third Bed; but in the Second, where the Weeds are,\r\nthe Corn will be diminish’d in Proportion to the Quantity of Weeds\r\namongst it.\r\n\r\nThe Sticks, having done no Injury to the Corn, shew there was room\r\nenough in the Bed for Company to lodge, would they forbear to eat; or\r\nelse (like Travellers in _Spain_) bring their Provision with them to\r\ntheir Inn, or (which would be the same thing) if Weeds could find there\r\nsome Dish so disagreeable to the Palate of the Corn, and agreeable to\r\ntheir own, that they might feed on it without robbing; and then they\r\nwould be as innocent as the Sticks, which take up the same Room with\r\nthe Weeds.\r\n\r\nThe Quantity of Nourishment Weeds rob the Corn of, is not in Proportion\r\nonly to their Number and Bulk, but to the Degrees of Heat in their\r\nConstitution; as appears by the Instance of Charlock and Turneps,\r\nmention’d in the Chapter _Of Change of Species_.\r\n\r\n’Tis needless to go about to compute the Value of the Damage Weeds do,\r\nsince all experienc’d Husbandmen know it to be very great, and would\r\nunanimously agree to extirpate their whole Race as intirely, as in\r\n_England_ they have done the Wolves, tho’ much more innocent, and less\r\nrapacious than Weeds[62].\r\n\r\n  [62] If we consider the Crops they utterly destroy, and those they\r\n  extremely diminish; and that very few Crops escape without receiving\r\n  Injury from them; it may be a Question, whether the Mischief Weeds\r\n  do to our Corn, is not as great as the Value of the Rent of all the\r\n  Arable Lands in _England_.\r\n\r\nBut alas! they find it impossible to be done, or even to be hoped for,\r\nby the common Husbandry; and the Reasons I take to be these.\r\n\r\nThe Seeds of most Sorts of Weeds are so hardy, as to lie sound and\r\nuncorrupt for many Years[63], or perhaps Ages in the Earth; and are not\r\nkill’d until they begin to grow or sprout, which very few of them do,\r\nunless the Land be plow’d; and then enough of them will ripen amongst\r\nthe sown Crop, to propagate and continue their Species, by shedding\r\ntheir Off-spring in the Ground (for ’tis observ’d they are generally\r\nripe before the Corn); and the Seeds of these do the same in the next\r\nsown Crop; and thus perpetuate their savage, wicked[64] Brood, from\r\nGeneration to Generation.\r\n\r\n  [63] The Seeds of _Lethean Poppy_ (call’d _Red-weed_) have lain\r\n  dormant 24 Years (the Land being, during that time, in _St. Foin_)\r\n  and then at first Plowing they came up very thick; this I have seen,\r\n  and so will many other Sorts of Weeds, when the Ground has lain\r\n  untill’d for an Age.\r\n\r\n  [64] The _French_ call them, _les Herbes Sauvages, & les mechantes\r\n  Herbes_.\r\n\r\nBesides, their Seeds never all come up in one Year, unless the Land be\r\nvery often plow’d; for they must have their exact Depth, and Degrees of\r\nMoisture and Heat, to make them grow; and such as have not these, will\r\nlie in the Ground, and retain their vegetative Virtue for Ages; and the\r\ncommon usual Plowings, not being sufficient to make them all, or the\r\ngreatest Part, grow, almost every Crop that ripens increases the Stock\r\nof Seed, until it make a considerable Part of the Staple of such Land\r\nas is sown without good Tillage and Fallowing.\r\n\r\nThe best Defence against these Enemies, which the Farmer has hitherto\r\nfound, is to endeavour their Destruction by a good Summer-fallow:\r\nThis indeed, if the Weather be propitious, does make Havock of them;\r\nbut still some will escape one Year’s Prosecution. Either by being\r\nsometimes situate so high, that the Sun’s Heat dries them, or sometimes\r\nlying so deep, that it cannot reach them; either way their Germination,\r\nwhich would have proved their Death, is prevented.\r\n\r\nAnother Faculty secures abundance of them, and that is, their being\r\nable to endure the Heat and Moisture of one Year without growing;\r\nas[65] wild Oats, and innumerable other Sorts of Weeds, will do; for\r\ngather these when ripe, sow them in the richest Bed, water them, and do\r\nall that is possible to make them grow the First Year, it will be vain\r\nLabour; they will resist all Enticements till the Second; that is, if\r\nyou gather them in Autumn, you cannot force them to grow until the next\r\nSpring come Twelve-month; and many of them will remain dormant even to\r\nthe next Year alter that, and some of them longer.\r\n\r\n  [65] I have not try’d wild Oats by sowing them in a Bed myself,\r\n  but have been so informed by others; and my own Experience hath\r\n  frequently shewn me, that they will come up, after lying many Years\r\n  in the Ground; and that very few Sorts of Weeds will come all up the\r\n  first Year, as Corn doth: If they did, the Tillage of one Year’s\r\n  Summer-fallow might extirpate them.\r\n\r\nBy this Means, One Year’s Summer-Fallow can have no Effect upon them,\r\nbut to prepare the Soil for their more vigorous Growth and plentiful\r\nIncrease the next Year after; and very rarely will the Farmer fallow\r\nhis Land Two Years successively; and often the Dung, which is made\r\nof the Straw of sown Corn, being full of the Seeds of Weeds, when\r\nspread on the Fallows, incumbers the Soil with another Stock of Weeds,\r\nas ample as that the Fallowing has destroy’d; and tho’ perhaps many\r\nof these may not grow the next Year, they will be sure to come up\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe other old Remedy is what often proves worse than the Disease; that\r\nis, what they call Weeding among sown Corn; for if by the Hook or Hand\r\nthey cut some Sorts (as Thistles) while they are young, they will\r\nsprout up again, like _Hydras_, with more Heads than before; and if\r\nthey are cut when full-grown, after they have done almost their utmost\r\nin robbing the Crop, ’tis like shutting the Stable-Door after the Steed\r\nis stolen.\r\n\r\nHand-weeders often do more Harm to the Corn with their Feet, than they\r\ndo Good by cutting or pulling out the Weeds with their Hands; and yet\r\nI have known this Operation sometimes cost the Farmer Twelve Shillings\r\nan Acre; besides the Damage done by treading down his Wheat; and,\r\nafter all, a sufficient Quantity of them have escaped, to make a too\r\nplentiful Increase in the next Crop of Corn.\r\n\r\nThe new Hoeing-Husbandry in Time will probably make such an utter\r\nRiddance[66] of all Sorts of Weeds[67], except such as come in the\r\nAir, that[68] as long as this Management is properly continued, there\r\nis no Danger to be apprehended from them; which is enough to confute\r\nthe old Error of equivocal Generation, had it not been already\r\nsufficiently exploded, ever since that Demonstration of _Malpighius’s_\r\nExperiment. For if Weeds were brought forth without their proper Seeds,\r\nthe Hoeing could not hinder their Production, where the Soil was\r\ninclined naturally to produce them. The Belief of that blind Doctrine\r\nmight probably be one of the Causes that made the Antients despair of\r\nfinding so great Success in Hoeing, as now appears; or else, if they\r\nhad had true Principles, they might perhaps have invented and improved\r\nthat Husbandry, and the Instruments necessary to put it in Practice.\r\n\r\n  [66] A very pernicious, large, perennial Weed, like _Burrage_, with a\r\n  blue Flower, infested a Piece of Land, for Time out of Mind: Hoeing\r\n  has destroyed it utterly; not one of the Species has been seen in the\r\n  Field these Seven Years, tho’ constantly till’d and ho’d.\r\n\r\n  [67] I have now a Piece of Wheat drill’d early the last Autumn upon\r\n  an Hill, fallowed and well pulveriz’d: Part of it was drill’d with\r\n  Wheat in double Rows upon the Level Nine Years ago, Horse-ho’d, and\r\n  the Partitions thoroughly Hand-ho’d to cleanse out the Poppies, of\r\n  which the Land was very full; the other Part of this Piece was never\r\n  drilled till this Year: The whole Piece hath not been before this\r\n  Winter Horse-ho’d. Now the Partitions of the Part that was never any\r\n  Way Ho’d, are so stock’d with Poppies matted together, that unless\r\n  they are taken out early in the Spring, they will totally devour the\r\n  Rows of Wheat; but in the other Part that was ho’d so long since,\r\n  there are now very few Poppies to be seen. Both these Parts have had\r\n  several sown Crops of Barley together since, and have lain with _St.\r\n  Foin_ these last Five or Six Years.\r\n\r\n  [68] And except also such Weeds, whose Seed is carried by Birds,\r\n  which is the most common Manner of transporting the Seeds of\r\n  Vegetables from Field to Field, against the Content of the Owner: For\r\n  Birds, whether great or small, do not care to eat their Prey where\r\n  they take it, but generally chuse some open Place for that Purpose.\r\n  ’Tis, I am persuaded, by this Means chiefly, that a Vineyard or\r\n  Field, made ever so clean from Grass, will, in lying untilled a few\r\n  Years, be replenished with a Turf of that neighbouring Species of\r\n  Grass, which best suits the Heat and Moisture of the Soil: Yet there\r\n  are some Species of Seeds that Birds (at least such as frequent this\r\n  Place) do not affect; else the Burrage-weed (mentioned in _p._ 77.)\r\n  would have appeared again in my Field in some of the many Years since\r\n  the Hoeing has extirpated it there; for it grows plentifully in the\r\n  unplowed Way adjoining thereto.\r\n\r\n  The Seeds of some Weeds may be suspected to come in the Air; as the\r\n  Seed of the Grass that grew in the _Cheapside_, in the Time of the\r\n  Plague; but it might come from Seeds in the Dirt, brought thither\r\n  by the Feet of People and Cattle, and by the Wheels of Coaches,\r\n  Carts carrying Hay: Or otherwise continual Treading might keep it\r\n  from Growing; and when the Treading ceased, ’tis no Wonder the Seeds\r\n  should furnish the Streets with Grass.\r\n\r\n  And I have observ’d on the Floors, two Stories high, of a lone,\r\n  ruinous, uninhabited House, being long uncover’d, a sort of Herb\r\n  growing very thick; I think it was _Pimpernel_, and believe that its\r\n  Seeds did not come thither in the Air; but in the Sand which was\r\n  mix’d with the Mortar that had fallen from the Cielings; and ’tis\r\n  like there were few Seeds at first: Yet, these, ripening for several\r\n  Years, shed their Seeds annually, until the Floors became all over\r\n  very thick planted: Besides, Hay-seeds and Pimpernel are too heavy to\r\n  be carry’d far by the Air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of_ TURNEPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as I can be inform’d, ’tis but of late Years that Turneps have\r\nbeen introduc’d as an Improvement in the Field.\r\n\r\nAll Sorts of Land, when made fine by Tillage, or by Manure and Tillage,\r\nwill serve to produce Turneps, but not equally; for chalky Land is\r\ngenerally too dry (a Turnep being a thirsty Plant); and they are so\r\nlong in such dry poor Land before they get into rough Leaf, that the\r\nFly is very apt to destroy them there; yet I have known them succeed on\r\nsuch Land, tho’ rarely.\r\n\r\nSand and Gravel are the most proper Soil for Turneps, because that is\r\nmost easily pulveriz’d, and its Warmth causeth the Turneps to grow\r\nfaster, and so they get the sooner out of the Danger of the Fly; and\r\nsuch a Soil, when well-till’d, and Horse-ho’d, never wants a sufficient\r\nMoisture, even in the driest Weather; and the Turneps being drill’d\r\nwill come up without Rain, and prosper very well with the sole\r\nMoisture of the Dews, which are admitted as deep as the Pulveration\r\nreacheth; and if that be to Five or six Inches, the hottest Sun cannot\r\nexhale the Dews thence in the Climate of _England_: I have known\r\nTurneps thrive well in a very dry Summer by repeated Horse-hoeings,\r\nboth in Sand and in Land which is neither sandy nor gravelly.\r\n\r\nWhen I sow’d Turneps by Hand, and ho’d them with a Hand-hoe, the\r\nExpence was great, and the Operation not half perform’d, by the\r\nDeceitfulness of the Hoers, who left half the Land unho’d, and cover’d\r\nit with the Earth from the Part they did hoe, and then the Grass and\r\nWeeds grew the faster: Besides, in this Manner a great Quantity of Land\r\ncould not be managed in the proper Season.\r\n\r\nWhen I drill’d upon the Level[69], at Three Feet Intervals, a Trial was\r\nmade between those Turneps and a Field of the next Neighbour’s, sown at\r\nthe same Time, whereof the Hand-hoeing cost Ten Shillings _per_ Acre,\r\nand had not quite half the Crop of the drill’d, both being measur’d by\r\nthe Bushel, on Purpose to find the Difference[70].\r\n\r\n  [69] ’Tis impossible to hoe-plow them so well when planted upon the\r\n  Level, as when they are planted upon Ridges; for if we plow deep near\r\n  the Row, the Earth will come over on the Left-Side of the Plough, and\r\n  bury the younger Turneps; but when they stand on Ridges, the Earth\r\n  will almost all fall down on the Right Side into the Furrow in the\r\n  Middle of the Interval.\r\n\r\n  [70] And I have since found, that Turneps on the same Land, planted\r\n  on Ridges, with Six-feet Intervals, make a Crop double to those that\r\n  are planted on the Level, or even on Ridges with Three-feet Intervals.\r\n\r\nIn the new Method they are more certain to come up quickly; because in\r\nevery Row, half the Seed is planted about Four Inches deep[71]; and the\r\nother Half is planted exactly over that, at the Depth of half an Inch,\r\nfalling in after the Earth has cover’d the first Half: Thus planted,\r\nlet the Weather be never so dry, the deepest Seed will come up; but\r\nif it raineth (immediately after planting), the Shallow will come up\r\nfirst: We also make it come up at Four[72] Times, by mixing our Seed,\r\nhalf new and half old (the new coming up a Day quicker than the old):\r\nThese four Comings up give it so many Chances for escaping the Fly,\r\nit being often seen, that the Seed sown over Night will be destroy’d\r\nby the Fly, when that sown the next Morning will escape, and _vice\r\nversa_[73]; or you may hoe-plow them, when you see the Fly is like to\r\ndevour them; this will bury the greatest Part of those Enemies; or else\r\nyou may drill in another Row, without new-plowing the Land.\r\n\r\n  [71] Turnep seed will come up from a greater Depth than most other\r\n  Sorts of Seeds.\r\n\r\n  [72] I have seen drill’d Turnep-seed come up daily for a Fortnight\r\n  together, when it has not been mixt thus, the old with the new.\r\n\r\n  [73] I have had the first Turneps that came up all destroy’d by the\r\n  Fly; and about a Fortnight afterwards more have come up, and been\r\n  ho’d time enough, and made a good Crop.\r\n\r\nThis Method has also another Advantage of escaping the Fly, the most\r\ncertain of any other, and infallible, if the Land be made fine, as\r\nit ought to be: This is to roll it with a heavy Roller across the\r\nRidges, after ’tis drill’d, which closing up the Cavities of the\r\nEarth, prevents the Fly’s Entrance and Exit, to lay the Eggs, hatch,\r\nor bring forth the young ones to prey upon the Turneps; which they\r\nmight intirely devour, if the Fly came before they had more than the\r\nfirst two Leaves, which, being form’d of the very Seed itself, are very\r\nsweet; but the next Leaves are rough and bitter, which the Fly does\r\nnot love: I have always found the Rolling disappoint the Fly; but very\r\noften it disappoints the Owner also, who sows at Random; for it makes\r\nthe Ground so hard, that the Turneps cannot thrive, but look yellow,\r\ndwindle, and grow to no Perfection, unless they have a good Hoeing soon\r\nafter the rough Leaves appear; for when they stand long without it,\r\nthey will be so poor and stinted, that the Hand-hoe does not go deep\r\nenough to recover them; and ’tis seldom that these rolled Turneps can\r\nbe Hand-ho’d at the critical Time, because the Earth is then become so\r\nhard, that the Hoe cannot enter it without great Difficulty, unless\r\nit be very moist; and very often the Rain does not come to soak it,\r\nuntil it be too late; but the drill’d Turneps being in single Rows with\r\nSix-feet Intervals, may be roll’d without Danger: For be the Ground\r\never so hard, the Hand-hoe will easily single them out, at the Price\r\nof Six-pence per Acre, or less (if not in Harvest); and the Horse-hoe\r\nwill, in those wide Intervals, plow at any Time, wet or dry; and, tho’\r\nthe Turneps should have been neglected till stinted, will go deep\r\nenough to recover them to a flourishing Condition.\r\n\r\nDrill’d Turneps, by being no-where but in the Rows[74], may be more\r\neasily seen than those which come up at Random; and may therefore be\r\nsooner[75] singled out by the Hand-hoe; which is another Advantage;\r\nbecause the sooner they are so set out, the better they will thrive[76].\r\n\r\n  [74] Drill’d Turneps coming all up nearly in a _Mathematical Line_,\r\n  ’tis very nearly that a Charlock, or other like Weed, comes up in the\r\n  same Line amongst them, unless it be drill’d in with the Turnep-seed,\r\n  of which Weeds our Horse-ho’d Seed never has any; there being no\r\n  Charlock in the Rows, nor any Turnep in the Intervals: We know, that\r\n  whatever comes up in the Interval is not a Turnep, though so like to\r\n  it, that, at first coming up, if promiscuously, it cannot easily be\r\n  distinguished by the Eye, until after the Turneps, _&c._ attain the\r\n  rough Leaf; and even then, before they are of a considerable Bigness,\r\n  they are so hard to be distinguished by those People, who are not\r\n  well experienced, that a Company of _Hand-hoers_ cut out the Turneps\r\n  by Mistake, and left the Charlock for a Crop of a large Field of\r\n  sown Turneps. Such a Misfortune can never happen to drill’d Turneps,\r\n  unless wilfully done, be they set out ever so young.\r\n\r\n  [75] The sooner they are made single, the better; but yet, when\r\n  they are not very thick, they may stand till we have the best\r\n  Convenience of singling them without much Damage; but, when they come\r\n  up extraordinary thick, ’twill be much more difficult to make them\r\n  single, if they are neglected at their very first coming into rough\r\n  Leaf.\r\n\r\n  [76] Because such young Turneps will enjoy the more of the Pasture\r\n  made by the Plowing, and by that little Pulveration of the Hand-hoe,\r\n  without being robb’d of any Pasture by their own supernumerary Plants.\r\n\r\nThree or Four Ounces of Seed is the usual Quantity to drill; but, at\r\nrandom, Three or Four Pounds are commonly sown, which, coming thick all\r\nover the Ground, must exhaust the Land more than the other, especially\r\nsince the sown must stand longer, before the Hoers can see to set them\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe Six-feet Ridges, whereon Turneps are drill’d in single Rows, may\r\nbe left higher than for double-row’d Crops; because there will be more\r\nEarth in the Intervals, as the single Row takes up less.\r\n\r\nThere is no prefix’d Time for planting Turneps, because that must be\r\naccording to the Richness of the Land; for some Land will bring them as\r\nforward, and make them as good, when planted the beginning of _August_,\r\nas other Land will, when planted in _May_; but the most general Time\r\nis, a little before, and a little after _Midsummer_.\r\n\r\nBetween these Rows of Turneps[77], I have planted Wheat in this Manner;\r\n_viz._ About _Michaelmas_, the Turneps being full grown, I plow’d a\r\nRidge in the Middle of each of their Intervals, taking most of the\r\nEarth from the Turneps, leaving only just enough to keep them alive;\r\nand on this Ridge drill’d my Crop of Wheat[78], and towards the Spring\r\npull’d up my Turneps, and carried them off for Cattle.\r\n\r\n  [77] As I have formerly drilled Wheat between Rows of Turneps, so I\r\n  have since had the Experience of drilling Turneps between Rows of\r\n  Barley and Rows of Oats: I have had them in the Intervals between\r\n  Six-feet Ridges, and between Four-feet Ridges, and between those of\r\n  several intermediate Distances; but which of them all is the best,\r\n  I leave at present undetermined. I shall only add, that the poorer\r\n  the Land is, the wider the Intervals ought to be; and that, in the\r\n  narrow, ’tis convenient at the Hoeing, to leave more Earth on that\r\n  Side of each Interval whereon the Turneps are to be drill’d; and this\r\n  is done by going round several Intervals with the Hoe-Plough, without\r\n  going forwards and backwards in each immediately: But in the wide\r\n  Intervals the Earth may be equal on both Sides of them.\r\n\r\n  I will propose another Method of Drilling, which may be very\r\n  advantageous to those who sow their Barley upon the Level, and sow\r\n  Turnep-seed amongst it, at Random, as they do Clover; which is, of\r\n  late, a common Practice in some Places. The Barley keeps the Turneps\r\n  under it, and stints them so much, that they are useful in the Winter\r\n  or Spring, chiefly by the Food their _Leaves_ afford to Sheep, their\r\n  Roots being exceeding small; and for this small Profit they lose the\r\n  Time of tilling the Ground, until after the Turneps are eaten off;\r\n  which is a Damage we think greater than the Profit of such Turneps;\r\n  To prevent which Damage, they may drill them in Rows at competent\r\n  Distances, and Horse-hoe them, and set them out as soon as the Barley\r\n  is off: This will both keep the Ground in Tilth, fit for another\r\n  Crop of Spring Corn, and cause the Turneps to grow great enough\r\n  (especially if Harvest be early, and the Winter prove favourable)\r\n  for feeding of Sheep in a moveable Fold to dung the Ground into the\r\n  Bargain.\r\n\r\n  What induces me to propose this Improvement is, that a Gentleman\r\n  plows up his Barley-Stubble, and transplants Turneps therein, and\r\n  Hand-hoes them with Success. By the proposed Way all the Expence\r\n  of transplanting (which must be considerable) will be saved; and\r\n  the setting out cannot be more than an Eighth of the Labour of\r\n  _Hand-hoeings_; and I conjecture the Horse-hoed Turneps may be as\r\n  good; for they (though stinted) having their Tap-roots remaining\r\n  unmoved below the Staple of the Land, their horizontal Roots, being\r\n  supply’d with Moisture from the Tap-roots, immediately take hold of\r\n  the fresh-plowed Earth, as soon as ’tis turned back to them; whereas\r\n  the transplanted, having their Tap-roots broken off, and their\r\n  Horizontal Roots crumpled in the Holes wherein they are set, must\r\n  lose Time, and be in Danger of dying with Thirst, if the Weather\r\n  proves dry.\r\n\r\n  Also this Way seems better than the common Practice of sowing Turneps\r\n  upon once plowing after Wheat; because the Wheat-land commonly\r\n  lies longer unplow’d by Six or Eight Months than Barley-land; and\r\n  therefore cannot be in so good Tilth for Turneps as Barley-land may,\r\n  unless the former be of a more friable Nature, or much more dunged,\r\n  than the latter. Besides, these Wheat-Turneps are uncertain, in\r\n  Respect of the Fly that often destroys them at their first coming up;\r\n  which Misfortune happened the Autumn 1734 to almost all that were\r\n  sown in that Manner.\r\n\r\n  I have observ’d, that Barley sown on the Level, and not hoed,\r\n  overcomes the Turneps that come up amongst it; but that Turneps,\r\n  which come up in the Partitions of Treble Rows of my Ridges of\r\n  Horse-hoed Barley, grew so vigorously as to overcome the Barley. And\r\n  this was demonstrated at Harvest in a long Field, one Side of which\r\n  had borne Turnep-seed, and the drilled Ridges of Barley crossing the\r\n  Middle of it; and both Ends of the Field having Barley sown on the\r\n  Level, one End of every Ridge cross’d the Turnep-seed Part of the\r\n  Field for about Ten Perches of their Length.\r\n\r\n  I observed also, that the Turneps near the Edges of the Lands of sown\r\n  Barley, adjoining to the hoed Intervals, grew large, but not so large\r\n  as those in the Partitions on the Ridges, their Intervals being hoed\r\n  on each Side of them.\r\n\r\n  But different from this have I seen shattered Turnep-seed coming up\r\n  in the like Partitions of drilled Wheat, on the very same Sort of\r\n  Land, so miserably poor and stinted, that they scarce grew a Hand’s\r\n  Breadth high, when those Turneps which the Hoe left in the Sides of\r\n  the Intervals, and at the narrow Edges of the unhoed Earth of the\r\n  Interval Sides of the Rows of Wheat, grew large; and the Wheat was\r\n  good also: But I do not remember how the middle Row of it succeeded.\r\n\r\n  This last Experience of the Turneps among the Wheat was got by this\r\n  Accident: The Wheat was drilled after drilled Turneps on Ridges of a\r\n  different Size. The Turneps were all pulled up before the Ground was\r\n  plowed for the Wheat; but as Turnep-seed never comes _all_ up the\r\n  first Year, enough remained of this to come up (though thinly) in the\r\n  Wheat, to shew exactly where every Row had been drilled; whereupon\r\n  the Observation was made.\r\n\r\n  [78] This Wheat, being thus drill’d on the new Ridges made in the\r\n  Intervals, betwixt the Rows of Turneps, being well Horse-ho’d in the\r\n  Spring, prov’d a very good Crop; it was drill’d in treble Rows, the\r\n  Partitions Seven Inches each.\r\n\r\nWhen Turneps are planted too late, to have Time and Sun for attaining\r\nto their full Bulk, some drill a double Row on each Six-feet Ridge,\r\nwith a Partition of Fourteen Inches; but I am told, that in this double\r\nRow the Turneps do not, even at that late Season, grow so large, as\r\nthose planted at the same time in single Rows, tho’ the double Row\r\nrequires double the Expence in setting out; and there will be less\r\nEarth ho’d by the Breadth of fourteen Inches of the deepest Part of the\r\nRidge, and consequently the Land will be the less improv’d for the next\r\nCrop. We need not to be very exact, in the Number[79] or Distance[80]\r\nwe set them out at; we contrive to leave the Master-turneps (when there\r\nis much Difference in them), and spare such when near one another,\r\nand leave the more Space before and behind them; but if they be Three\r\nMaster-turneps too near together, we take out the middlemost.\r\n\r\n  [79] The least Number will be the largest Turneps; yet we should have\r\n  a competent Stock, which I think is not less than Thirty on a square\r\n  Perch.\r\n\r\n  [80] The Distance need not to be regular; for when a Turnep has Six\r\n  Inches of Room on one Side, and Eighteen Inches on the other Side,\r\n  ’tis almost as well as if there was one Foot on each Side: tho’ then\r\n  it would be equally distant from the Two Turneps betwixt which it\r\n  stood.\r\n\r\nTurneps that were so thick as to touch one another when half-grown, by\r\nmeans of well Hoeing their wide Intervals, have afterwards grown to a\r\ngood Bigness, and by thrusting against one another became oval, instead\r\nof round.\r\n\r\n’Tis beneficial to hoe Turneps (especially the first Time) alternately;\r\n_viz._ to hoe every other Interval, and throw the Earth back again\r\nbefore we hoe the other Intervals; for by this Means the Turneps are\r\nkept from being[81] stinted: ’Tis better to have Nourishment given them\r\nmoderately at twice, than to have it all once, and be twice as long\r\nbefore a Repetition[82].\r\n\r\n  [81] Because this alternate Hoeing doth not at all endanger the\r\n  Roots by being dried by the Sun; for whilst one half of the Roots\r\n  have Moisture, ’tis sufficient; the other Half will be supplied from\r\n  those; so that they will soon take hold of the Earth again after\r\n  being moved by the Hoe.\r\n\r\n  [82] Sometimes, when Turneps are planted late, this alternate Hoeing\r\n  suffices without any Repetition; but when they are planted early,\r\n  ’twill be necessary to hoe them again; especially if Weeds appear.\r\n\r\nTho’ the Earth on each Side the Row be left as narrow as possible[83];\r\nyet ’tis very profitable to hoe that little with a _Bidens_[84], called\r\nhere a Prong-hoe[85]; for this will be sure to let out all the Roots\r\ninto the Intervals; even such as run very nearly parallel to the Rows.\r\n\r\n  [83] I do not think that we can go nearer to the Plants with\r\n  the Hoe-plough, than within Three Inches of their Bodies.\r\n\r\n  [84] We ought not to use the _Bidens_ for this Purpose, before the\r\n  perpendicular Roots are as big as one’s little Finger.\r\n\r\n  [85] Some of these Prong-hoes have Three Teeth, and are reckoned\r\n  better as a _Tridens_ than a _Bidens_; but this is only in mellow\r\n  Ground.\r\n\r\nThis alternate Way of Hoeing Plants that grow in single Rows, is of\r\nsuch vast Advantage, that four of these, which are but equal to Two of\r\nthe _whole_ Hoeings in Labour, are near equal to four _whole_ Hoeings\r\nin Benefit; for when one Side is well nourished, the other Side cannot\r\nbe starv’d[86].\r\n\r\n  [86] But yet sometimes the Weeds, or other Circumstances, may make it\r\n  proper to give them a _whole_ Hoeing at first.\r\n\r\nBesides, where a great Quantity of Turneps are to be ho’d, the last\r\nho’d may be stinted, before the first are finish’d by _whole_ Hoeings.\r\n\r\nIn this alternate Hoeing, the Hoe-plough may go deeper[87] and nearer\r\nto the Row, without Danger of thrusting it down on the Left Side,\r\nwhilst the Plants are very small; because the Earth on the other Side\r\nof the Row always bears against it for its Support: But in the _whole_\r\nHoeing, there is an open Furrow left the first Time on both Sides of\r\nthe Row, and there is Danger of throwing it into one Furrow in plowing\r\nthe other; or, if the Row is not thrown down, it may be too much dry’d\r\nin hot Weather, by the Two Furrows lying too long open: Yet, when the\r\nTurneps are large before Hoeing, we need not fear either of these\r\nDangers in giving them a _whole_ Hoeing; as I have found by Experience,\r\neven when there has been left on each Side of the Row only about Three\r\nInches Breadth of Earth; tho’ it is not best to suffer it to lie long\r\nopen[88].\r\n\r\n  [87] This deep Plowing so near to the Row is very beneficial at\r\n  first; but afterwards, when the Plants are grown large, and have sent\r\n  their Roots far into the Intervals, it would almost totally disroot\r\n  them; and they, being Annuals, might not live long enough for a new\r\n  Stock of Roots to extend so far as is necessary to bring the Turneps\r\n  to their full Bigness.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, At the last Hoeing we generally leave a broad, deep Trench in\r\n  the middle of each Interval.\r\n\r\n  [88] But, if the Weather prove wet, we always suffer those Furrows to\r\n  lie open, until the Earth be dry enough to be turn’d back again to\r\n  the Row, without smearing or flicking together; unless such Weather\r\n  continue so long that the Weeds begin to come up, and then we throw\r\n  back the Furrows to stifle the Weeds, before they grow large, tho’\r\n  the Earth be wet.\r\n\r\nDry Weather does not injure Turneps when Horse-ho’d, as it does sown\r\nTurneps; the Hand-hoe does not go deep enough to keep the Earth moist,\r\nand secure the Plants against the Drought; and that is the best Season\r\nfor Horse-hoeing, which always can keep the Roots moist[89].\r\n\r\n  [89] But if some Sorts of Earth have lain so long unmoved as to\r\n  become very hard before the first Hoeing, the Hoe, going very rear\r\n  to the Rows on each Side, may cause such hard Earth whereon the Rows\r\n  stand, to crack and open enough to let in the Drought (_i. e._ the\r\n  Sun and Air) to the Roots in very dry Weather. In this Case ’tis best\r\n  to _Horse-hoe_ alternately, as is directed in _Page_ 86.\r\n\r\nDung and Tillage together will attain the necessary Degree of\r\nPulveration, in less time than Plowing can do alone: Therefore Dung is\r\nmore useful for Turneps, because they have commonly less time to grow\r\nthan other Plants.\r\n\r\nTurneps of Nineteen Pounds Weight I have several Times heard of, and of\r\nSixteen Pounds Weight often known; and Twelve Pounds may be reckon’d\r\nthe middle Size of great Turneps: And I can see no Reason, why every\r\nTurnep should not arrive to the full Bigness of its Species, if it did\r\nnot want Part of its due Nourishment.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Inconvenience, which has been observ’d in the\r\nTurnep-husbandry, is, when they are fed off late in the Spring (which\r\nis in many Places the greatest Use of them), there is not time to bring\r\nthe Land in Tilth for Barley; the Loss of which Crop is sometimes more\r\nthan the Gain of the Turneps: This is intirely remedied by the drilling\r\nMethod; for, by that, the Land may be almost as well till’d before the\r\nTurneps are eaten, or taken off, as it can afterwards.\r\n\r\nIf Turneps be sown in _June_, or the Beginning of _July_, the most\r\nexperienced Turnep-Farmers will have no more than Thirty to a square\r\nPerch left in Hand-hoeing; and find that when more are left, the Crop\r\nwill be less; but, in drilling the Rows at Six Feet Intervals, there\r\nmay be Sixty to a Perch; and the Horse-hoe, by breaking so much more\r\nEarth than the Hand-hoe does, can nourish Sixty drill’d, as well as\r\nThirty are by the sowing Method, which has been made appear upon Trial;\r\nbut, I think, about Forty or Forty-five better than Sixty on a Perch;\r\nand the Number of Plants should always be proportion’d to the natural\r\nand artificial Pasture which is to maintain them; and sixty Turneps\r\non a square Perch, at Five Pounds each (which is but a Third of the\r\nWeight of the large Size of Sheep-Turneps), make a Crop of above Eighty\r\nQuarters to an Acre[90].\r\n\r\n  [90] I have had Turneps upon poor undung’d Land, that weigh’d\r\n  Fourteen Founds a-piece; but these were only such as had more Room\r\n  than the rest. I have seen a whole Waggon-load of drill’d Turneps\r\n  spread on the Ground, wherein I believe one could not have found\r\n  one that weighed so little as six Pounds; or if the Rows had been\r\n  searched before they had been pull’d up, they would have weighed\r\n  Seven or Eight Pounds apiece one with another; we weighed some of\r\n  them that were Thirteen, some Fourteen Pounds each, and yet they\r\n  stood pretty thick: There might be, as I guess, about Fifty on a\r\n  square Perch; but this Crop was on sandy Land, not poor; and was\r\n  dung’d the Third or Fourth Year before; and had every Year a ho’d\r\n  Crop of Potatoes, or Wheat, until the Year wherein the Turneps were\r\n  planted.\r\n\r\nWhen Turneps are planted late (especially upon poor Ground), they may\r\nbe a greater Number than when planted early; because they will not have\r\ntime enough of Heat to enjoy the full Benefit of Hoeing, which would\r\notherwise cause them to grow larger.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Turnep-Improvement used by the Farmer, is for his Cattle\r\nin the Winter; one Acre of Turneps will then maintain more than Fifty\r\nof Meadow or Pasture-ground.\r\n\r\n’Tis now so well known, that most Cattle will eat them, and how much\r\nthey breed Milk, _&c._ that I need say nothing about it.\r\n\r\nSheep always refuse them at first, and, unless they have eaten them\r\nwhilst they were Lambs, must be ready to starve before they will feed\r\non them; tho’, when they have tasted them, they will be fatted by them;\r\nand I have seen Lambs of Three Weeks old scoop them prettily, when\r\nthose of a Year old (which are called Tegs) have been ready to die with\r\nHunger amongst them; and for Three or Four Days would not touch them,\r\nbut at last eat them very well.\r\n\r\nIn some Places, the greatest Use of Turneps (except for fatting Oxen\r\nand Sheep) is for Ewes and Lambs in the Spring, when natural Grass is\r\nnot grown on poor Ground; and if the artificial Grass be then fed by\r\nthe common Manner, the Crop will be spoil’d, and it will yield the less\r\nPasture all the Summer: I have known Farmers, for that Reason, oblig’d\r\nto keep their Ewes and Lambs upon Turneps (tho’ run up to Seed) even\r\nuntil the Middle of _April_.\r\n\r\nThere are now three Manners of spending Turneps with Sheep, amongst\r\nwhich I do not reckon the Way of putting a Flock of Sheep into a large\r\nGround of Turneps without dividing it; for in that Case the Flock will\r\ndestroy as many Turneps in a Fortnight, as should keep them well a\r\nwhole Winter.\r\n\r\nThe First Manner now in Use is, to divide the Ground of Turneps by\r\nHurdles, giving them leave to come upon no more at a Time than they\r\ncan eat in one Day, and so advance the Hurdles farther into the Ground\r\ndaily, until all be spent; but we must observe, that they never eat\r\nthem clean this Way, but leave the Bottoms and Outsides of the Turneps\r\nthey have scoop’d in the Ground. These Bottoms People pull up with Iron\r\nCrooks, made for that Purpose; but their Cavities being tainted with\r\nUrine, Dung, and Dirt from their Feet, tho’ the Sheep do eat some of\r\nthe Pieces, they waste more, and many the Crooks leave behind in the\r\nEarth; and even what they do eat of this tainted Food, can’t nourish\r\nthem so well as that which is fresh and cleanly.\r\n\r\nThe second Manner is, to move the Hurdles every Day, as in the First;\r\nbut that the Sheep may not tread upon the Turneps, they pull them up\r\nfirst, and then advance the Hurdles as far daily as the Turneps are\r\npull’d up, and no farther: By this Means there is not that Waste made\r\nas in the other Way; the Food is eaten fresh and clean; and the Turneps\r\nare pull’d up with less Labour than their Pieces can be[91].\r\n\r\n  [91] I have seen Three Labourers work every Day with their Crooks,\r\n  to pull up these Pieces, which was done with much Difficulty, the\r\n  Ground being trodden very hard by the Sheep; when one Person, in Two\r\n  Hours time, would have pull’d up all the _whole_ Turneps daily, and\r\n  the Sheep would have eaten them clean; but so many of those Pieces\r\n  were dry’d and spoil’d, that, after the Land was sown with Barley,\r\n  they appear’d very thick upon the Surface, and there could not be\r\n  much less than half the Crop of Turneps wasted, notwithstanding the\r\n  Contrivance of these Crooks.\r\n\r\nThe Third Manner is, to pull them up, and to carry them into some other\r\nGround in a Cart, or Waggon, and there spread them every Day on a new\r\nPlace, where the Sheep will eat them up clean, both Leaf and Root:\r\nThis is done when there is Land not far off, which has more Need of\r\nDung, than that where the Turneps grow, which perhaps is also too wet\r\nfor Sheep in the Winter; and then the Turneps will, by the too great\r\nMoisture and Dirt of the Soil, spoil the Sheep, and in some Soils\r\ngive them the Rot, yet such Ground will bring forth more and larger\r\nTurneps than dry Land; and when they are carry’d off, and eaten on\r\nplow’d Ground in dry Weather, and on Green-swerd in wet Weather, the\r\nSheep will thrive much better; and that moist Soil, not being trodden\r\nby the Sheep, will be in much the better Order for a Crop of Corn. And\r\ngenerally the Expence of Hurdles, and removing them, being saved, will\r\nmore than countervail the Labour of carrying off the Turneps.\r\n\r\nThese Three Ways of spending Turneps with Sheep are common to those\r\ndrill’d, and to those sown in the random Manner; but they must always\r\nbe carry’d off for Cows and Oxen; both which will be well fatted by\r\nthem, and some Hay in the Winter: The Management of these is the\r\nBusiness of a Grazier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_Of_ WHEAT.\r\n\r\nTho’ all Sorts of Vegetables may have great Benefit from the Hoe,\r\nbecause it supplies them with Plenty of Food, at the Time of their\r\ngreatest Need, yet they do not all equally require Hoeing; but the\r\nPlant that is to live the longest, should have the largest Stock of\r\nSustenance provided for it: Generally Wheat lives, or ought to live,\r\nlonger than other Sorts of Corn; for if it be not sown before Spring,\r\nits Grain will be thin, and have but little Flour in it, which is the\r\nonly useful Part for making Bread. And when sown late in the Winter,\r\n’tis in great Danger of Death from the Frost, whilst weak and tender,\r\nbeing maintained (as a _Fœtus_) by the umbilical Vessels, until the\r\nWarmth of the Sun enables it to send out sufficient Roots of its own to\r\nsubsist on, without Help of the _Ovum_.\r\n\r\nTo prevent these Inconveniences, Wheat is usually sown in Autumn:\r\nHence, having about thrice the Time to be maintain’d that Spring Corn\r\nhath, it requires a larger Supply of Nourishment, in proportion to that\r\nlonger Time; not because the Wheat in its Infancy consumes the Stock\r\nof Food, during the Winter, proportionably to what it does afterwards;\r\nbut because, during that long Interval betwixt Autumn and Spring\r\nSeed-times, most of the artificial Pasture is naturally lost, both in\r\nlight and in strong Land.\r\n\r\nFor this very Reason is that extraordinary Pains of fallowing and\r\ndunging the Soil, necessary to Wheat; tho’, notwithstanding all\r\nthat Labour and Expence, the Ground is generally grown so stale by\r\nthe Spring, and so little of the Benefit of that chargeable Culture\r\nremains, that, if Part of the same Field be sown in the Beginning of\r\n_April_, upon fresh Plowing, without the Dung, or Year’s Fallow, it\r\nwill be as great or a greater Crop, in all Respects, except the Flour,\r\nwhich fails only for want of Time to fill the Grain.\r\n\r\nPoor light Land, by the common Husbandry, must be very well cultivated\r\nand manur’d, to maintain Wheat for a whole Year, which is the usual\r\nTime it grows thereon; and if it be sown late, the greatest Part of\r\nit will seldom survive the Winter, on such Land; and if it be sown\r\nvery early on strong Land, tho’ rich, well till’d, and dung’d, the\r\nCrop will be worse than on the poor light Land sown early. So much do\r\nthe long Winter’s Rains cause the Earth to subside, and the divided\r\nParts to coalesce, and lock out the Roots from the Stock of Provision,\r\nwhich, tho’ it was laid in abundantly at Autumn, the Wheat has no great\r\nOccasion of until the Spring; and then the Soil is become too hard for\r\nthe Roots to penetrate; and therefore must starve (like _Tantalus_)\r\namidst Dainties, which may tempt the Roots, but cannot be attain’d by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut the new Method of Hoeing gives, to strong and to light Land, all\r\nthe Advantages, and takes away all the Disadvantages, of both; as\r\nappears in the Chapters of _Tillage_ and _Hoeing_. By this Method the\r\nstrong Land may be planted with Wheat as early as the light (if plow’d\r\ndry); and the Hoe-Plough can, if rightly apply’d, raise a Pasture to\r\nit[92], equal to that of Dung in both Sorts of Land.\r\n\r\n  [92] Because the Hoe may go in it all the Year, and the Soil being\r\n  _infinitely divisible_, the Division which the Hoe may make whilst\r\n  the Crop is growing, added to the common Tillage, may equal, or even\r\n  exceed, a common Dressing with Dung, as I have often experienced.\r\n\r\nAbout the Year 1701, when I had contrived my Drill for planting St.\r\nFoin, I made use of it also for Wheat. Drilling many Rows at once,\r\nwhich made the Work much more compendious, and perform’d it much\r\nbetter than Hands could do, making the Channels of a Foot Distance,\r\ndrilling in the Seed, and covering it, did not in all amount to more\r\nthan Six-pence _per_ Acre Expence, which was above ten Times over-paid\r\nby the Seed that was saved; for One Bushel to an Acre was the Quantity\r\ndrill’d; there remain’d then no need of Hand-work, but for the Hoeing;\r\nand this did cost from Half a Crown to Four Shillings _per_ Acre. This\r\nway turn’d to a very good Account, and in considerable Quantities; it\r\nhas brought as good a Crop of Wheat on Barley-stubble, as that sown the\r\ncommon Way on Summer-fallow; and when that sown the old Way, on the\r\nsame Field, on Barley-stubble, intirely fail’d, tho’ there was no other\r\nDifference but the Drilling and Hoeing: It was also such an Improvement\r\nto the Land, that when, one Part of a strong whitish Ground, all of\r\nequal Goodness, and equally fallow’d and till’d, was dung’d and sown in\r\nthe common Manner, and the other Part was thus drill’d and hand-ho’d\r\nwithout Dung, the ho’d Part was not only the best Crop, but the whole\r\nPiece being fallow’d the next Year, and sown all alike by a Tenant,\r\nthe ho’d Part produc’d so much a better Crop of Wheat than the dung’d\r\nPart, that a Stranger would have believ’d by looking on it, that that\r\nPart had been dung’d which was not[93], and that Part not to have been\r\ndung’d which really was.\r\n\r\n  [93] If the Dung did pulverize as much as the Hoeing, the Cause must\r\n  be from the different Exhaustion.\r\n\r\nScarce any Land is so unfit, and ill prepar’d, for Wheat, as that where\r\nthe natural Grass[94] abounds. Most other sorts of Weeds may be dealt\r\nwithal when they come among drill’d Wheat; but ’tis impossible to\r\nextract Grass from the Rows: Therefore let that be kill’d before the\r\nWheat be planted.\r\n\r\n  [94] One Bunch of natural Grass, transplanted by the Plough into a\r\n  treble Row of Wheat, will destroy almost a whole Yard of it.\r\n\r\nThe Six-feet Ridges being Eleven, on Sixty-six Feet, which is an\r\nAcre’s Breadth, ought to be made Lengthways of the Field, if there\r\nbe no Impediment against it; as if it be an Hill of any considerable\r\nSteepness, then they must be made to run up and down, whether that be\r\nthe Length or Breadth of the Piece; for if the Ridges should go cross\r\nsuch a Hill, they could not be well Horse-ho’d; because it would be\r\nvery difficult to turn a Furrow upwards, close to the Row above it, or\r\nto turn a Furrow downwards, without burying the Row below it; and even\r\nwhen a Furrow is turn’d from the lower Row, enough of the Earth to bury\r\nthat Row will be apt to run over on the Left-side of the Plough; unless\r\nit goes at such a Distance from the Row, as to give it no Benefit of\r\nHoeing.\r\n\r\nThese Ridges should be made strait and equal: And to make them\r\nstrait[95] all good Ploughmen know how; and they will, by setting up\r\nMarks to look at, plow in a Line like the Path of an Arrow: But to make\r\nthe Ridges equal, ’tis necessary to mark out a Number of them, before\r\nyou begin to plow, by short Sticks set up at each End of the Piece;\r\nand then if one Ridge happen to be a little too broad, the next may\r\nbe made the narrower; for if the Plough comes not out exactly at the\r\nsecond Stick, the Two Ridges may be made equal by the next Plowing,\r\nor by the Drilling; but if many contiguous Ridges should be too wide,\r\nor too narrow, ’twill be difficult to bring them all to an Equality\r\nafterwards, without levelling the whole Piece, and laying out the\r\nRidges all anew.\r\n\r\n  [95] But if the Piece be of such a crooked or serpentine Form, that\r\n  the Ridges cannot well be plow’d strait the first Time, ’tis best to\r\n  drill it upon the Level; and then the marking Wheels may direct for\r\n  making the Row all parallel and equidistant; which will guide the\r\n  Plough to make all the Ridges for the next and all the subsequent\r\n  Crops, as equal.\r\n\r\nThe exact Height of Ridges, which is best, I cannot determine[96]: A\r\ndifferent Soil may require a different Height, according to the Depth,\r\nRichness, and Pulveration of the Mould. As Wheat covets always to lie\r\ndry in the Winter, so there is no other way to keep it so dry as these\r\nRidges; for when they are, after the first Hoeing, about Eighteen\r\nInches broad[97], with a Ditch on each Side, of almost a Foot deep,\r\nthe Rain-water runs off such narrow Ridges as fast it falls, and much\r\nsooner[98] than ’tis possible for it to do from broad Ridges.\r\n\r\n  [96] I find by measuring my Wheat Ridges in the Spring, that none of\r\n  them are quite a Foot high; and some of them only Six Inches; but I\r\n  know not how much they have subsided in the Winter; for they were\r\n  certainly higher when first made.\r\n\r\n  [97] This is the Breadth the Ridges are generally left at, when the\r\n  Furrows are hoed from them, and thrown into the Intervals.\r\n\r\n  [98] Water, when it runs off very soon, is beneficial, as is seen\r\n  in water’d Meadows; but where it remains long on, or very near the\r\n  Bodies of terrestrial Plants, it kills them, or at least is very\r\n  injurious to them.\r\n\r\nAnd the deeper the Soil, the more occasion there commonly is of this\r\nhigh Situation; because such Land is wetter for the most Part than\r\nshallow Land, where we cannot make the Furrows so deep, nor the Ridges\r\nso high[99], as in deep Land; for we must never plow below the Staple.\r\nI see the Wheat on these ho’d Ridges flourish, and grow vigorously, in\r\nwet Weather, when other Wheat looks yellow and sickly.\r\n\r\n  [99] If we should make our Ridges as high on a shallow Soil, as we\r\n  may on a deep Soil, there would be a Deficiency of Mould in the\r\n  Intervals of equal Breadth with those of a deep Soil.\r\n\r\nThe same wide Interval, which is ho’d betwixt Ridges the First time,\r\nwith Two Furrows, must have had Four Furrows, to hoe it on the Level;\r\nor else the Furrow, that is turn’d from the Row, would rise up, and a\r\ngreat Part of it fall over to the Left-hand, and bury the Row; but when\r\nturn’d from a Ridge, it will all fall down to the Right-hand.\r\n\r\nYou must not leave the Tops of the Ridges quite so narrow and sharp\r\nfor Drilling of Wheat, as you may for drilling Turneps; Wheat being in\r\ntreble Rows, but Turneps generally in single Rows[100]. This is our\r\nMethod of making Ridges for the First Crop of drill’d Wheat.\r\n\r\n  [100] A single Row taking up less of the Breadth, may be afforded to\r\n  have more of the Ridge’s Depth; because it leaves the Interval wider.\r\n\r\nBut the Method of making Ridges for a succeeding Crop, after the former\r\nis harvested, is best perform’d as follows: In making Ridges for Wheat\r\nafter Wheat, you must raise them to their full Height, before you plow\r\nthe old Partitions, with their Stubble, up to them; for if you go about\r\nto make the Ridges higher afterwards, the Stubble will so mix with the\r\nMould of their Tops, that it may not only be an Hindrance to the Drill,\r\nbut also to the First Hoeing; because if the Hoe-plough goes so near\r\nto the Rows as it ought, it would be apt to tear out the Wheat-plants\r\nalong with the Stubble.\r\n\r\nIn Reaping, we cut as near as we can to the Ground[101]; which is\r\neasily done, because the Stalks stand all close together at Bottom,\r\ncontrary to those of sown Wheat.\r\n\r\n  [101] When Wheat is reap’d very low, the Stubble is no great\r\n  Impediment; and I do this when I am forc’d to inlarge the Breadth\r\n  of my Ridges, or to change their Bearing, as I do when I find it\r\n  convenient for them to point Cross-ways of the Field instead of\r\n  Length ways; as if one End of it be wetter than the other: For ’tis\r\n  inconvenient, that one End of a Ridge should be in the wet Part, and\r\n  the other in the dry; because, in that Case, we cannot hoe the dry\r\n  End without hoeing the wet at the same time; and whilst we attend for\r\n  the wet Part to become dry, it may happen, that the Season for hoeing\r\n  the whole (if the Quantity be great) may be lost.\r\n\r\nI find this Stubble, when ’tis only mixt with the Intervals, very\r\nbeneficial to the Hoeing of my Wheat; but I know not whether it may be\r\nso in rich miry Land.\r\n\r\nAs soon as conveniently you can, after the Crop of Wheat is carried off\r\n(if the Trench in the Middle of each wide Interval be left deep enough\r\nby the last Hoeing), go as near as you can to the Stubble with a common\r\nPlough, and turn Two large Furrows into the Middle of the Intervals,\r\nwhich will[102] make a Ridge over the Place where the Trench was: But\r\nif the Trench be not deep enough, go first in the Middle of it with\r\none Furrow; which with Two more taken from the Ridges, will be three\r\nFurrows in each Interval; continue this Plowing as long as the dry\r\nWeather lasteth; and then finish, by turning the Partitions (whereon\r\nthe last Wheat grew) up to the new Ridges, which is usually done at\r\nTwo great Furrows. You may plow these last Furrows, which complete the\r\nRidges, in wet Weather.\r\n\r\n  [102] ’Tis the Depth and Fineness of this Ridge that the Success of\r\n  our Crop depends on; the Plants having nothing else to maintain them\r\n  during the First Six Months; and if, for want of Sustenance, they are\r\n  weak in the Spring, ’twill be more difficult to make them recover\r\n  their Strength afterwards so fully as to bring them to their due\r\n  Perfection. But Ploughmen have found a Trick to disappoint us in this\r\n  fundamental Part of our Husbandry, if they are not narrowly watched:\r\n  They do it in the following Manner; _viz._ They contrive to leave\r\n  the Trench very shallow; and then, in turning the Two First Furrows\r\n  of the Ridge, they hold the Plough towards the Left, which raises up\r\n  the Fin of the Share, and leaves so much of the Earth whereon the\r\n  Rows are to stand whole and unplowed, that after once Harrowing there\r\n  doth not remain above Two or Three Inches in Depth of fine Earth\r\n  underneath the Rows when drilled, instead of Ten or Twelve Inches.\r\n\r\n  On a Time, when my Diseases permitted me to go into the Wheat-field,\r\n  where my Ploughs were at Work, I discovered this Trick, and ventured\r\n  to ask my chief Ploughman his Reason for doing this in my Absence,\r\n  contrary to my Direction. He magisterially answer’d, according to his\r\n  own Theory, which Servants judge ought to be follow’d before that\r\n  of him they call Master, saying, That as the Roots of Wheat never\r\n  reached more than Two or Three Inches deep, there was no need that\r\n  the fine Mould should be any deeper. But those shallow Ridges, which\r\n  were indeed too many, producing a Crop very much inferior to the\r\n  contiguous deep Ridges, shewed, at my Cost, the Mistake of my cunning\r\n  Ploughman.\r\n\r\n  ’Tis true, that People who examine Wheat-roots when dead, are apt\r\n  to fall into this mistake; for then they are shrivell’d up, and so\r\n  rotten, that they break off very near to the Stalk in pulling up;\r\n  but if they are examined in their Vigour at Summer with Care, in\r\n  a friable Soil, they may be seen to descend as deep as the fine\r\n  pulveriz’d Mould reacheth, though that should be a Foot in Thickness.\r\n\r\n  I took up a Wheat-ear in Harvest that had lain on the Grass in wet\r\n  Weather, where the Wind could not come to dry it, which had sent out\r\n  white Roots like the Teeth of a Comb, some of them Three Inches long:\r\n  None having reached the Ground, they could not be nourished from any\r\n  thing but the Grains, which remained fast to the Ear, and had not as\r\n  yet sent out any Blade. ’Tis unreasonable to imagine, that such a\r\n  single Root as one of these, when in the Earth, from whence it must\r\n  maintain a pretty large Plant all or most Part of the Winter, should\r\n  descend no farther than when it was itself maintained from the Flour\r\n  of the Grain only.\r\n\r\nTo make a Six-feet Ridge very high, will sometimes require more\r\nFurrows; as when the Middle of the Intervals are open very wide and\r\ndeep, then Six Furrows to the whole Ridge may be necessary, and they\r\nnot little ones; and the Season makes a Difference, as well as the Size\r\nof the Furrows; for when the fine Mould is very dry (which is best), it\r\nwill much of it run to the Left-hand before the Plough, and also more\r\nwill run back again to the Left after the Plough is gone past it.\r\n\r\nBut when such Ridges have been made for Wheat, and the Season continues\r\nlong too dry for planting it, and the Stubble not thrown up, we then\r\nplow one deep Furrow on the Middle of each Ridge, and then plow the\r\nwhole Ridge at Four Furrows more, which will raise it very high. This\r\nWay of replowing the Ridges moves all the Earth of them, and yet is\r\ndone at Five Furrows.\r\n\r\nThe Furrows, necessary for raising up the Ridges, must be more, or\r\nfewer, in regard to the Bigness of them; because Six small Furrows\r\nmay be less than Four great ones. ’Tis not best to plow the Stubble\r\nup to the Ridges, until just before Planting (especially in the early\r\nPlowing); because that will hinder the Re-plowing of the First Furrows,\r\nwhich, if the Season continues dry, may be necessary: Sometimes we do\r\nthis by opening One Furrow in the Middle of the Ridge, sometimes Two,\r\nand afterwards raise up the Ridges again; and when they are become\r\nmoist enough at Top (the old Partitions being plow’d up to them), we\r\nharrow them once[103] (and that only Lengthways); and then drill them.\r\n\r\n  [103] But if once be not sufficient to level the Tops of the Ridges\r\n  fit for the Drill to pass thereon, as it always will, unless the\r\n  Two hard Furrows lie so high, that all the Three Shares of the\r\n  Drill cannot reach to make their Channels, in this Case you must\r\n  harrow again until they can all reach deep enough. Also in some\r\n  Sort of Land, that when drilled late, and very moist, will stick\r\n  to the Shares like Pitch or Bird-lime, whereby the Channels are\r\n  in Part left open by the Drill-harrow, it must be harrowed after\r\n  ’tis drilled, because ’tis necessary in such Land to take off the\r\n  common Drill-harrow, in order for a Man to follow the Drill with a\r\n  Paddle, or else a forked Stick, with which he frees the Sheats of\r\n  the adhering Dirt; this Harrow being gone, much of the Seed will\r\n  lie uncovered, and then must be covered with common Harrows; unless\r\n  a Drill-harrow, which was not in Use when my Plates were made, be\r\n  placed instead of that taken off: This, with its two Iron _Tines_,\r\n  will cover the Seed in this Case much better than common Harrows, and\r\n  will be no Hindrance to cleansing of the Sheats, the Legs by which\r\n  this Harrow is drawn, being remote from them, placed at near the End\r\n  of the Plank; and _note_, that the most proper Drill for this Purpose\r\n  is one that has only Two Shares, standing a Foot or fourteen Inches\r\n  asunder: This Harrow serves for taking up the Drill to turn it.\r\n\r\nThere is a Necessity of plowing the old Partitions up to the new Ridges\r\nto support their other Earth from falling down by the Harrowing and\r\nDrilling, which would else make them level.\r\n\r\nOur Ridges, after the First Time of Plowing, excel common Ridges of the\r\nsame Height; because these, tho’ as deep in Mould at the Tops, have\r\nlittle of it till’d at the last Plowing; but ours, being made upon the\r\nopen Trenches, consist of new-till’d pulveriz’d Mould, from Top to\r\nBottom.\r\n\r\n’Tis a general Rule, that all Sorts of Grain and Seeds prosper best,\r\nsown when the Ground is so dry, as to be broken into the most Parts\r\nby the Plough. The Reason why Wheat is an Exception to that Rule is,\r\nbecause it must endure the Rigours of Winter, which ’tis the better\r\nable to do, by the Earth’s being press’d or trodden harder, and closer\r\nto it[104], as it is when moved wet.\r\n\r\n  [104] ’Tis for that Reason, that Farmers drive their Sheep over very\r\n  light Land, as soon as ’tis sown with Wheat, to tread the (Top or)\r\n  Surface of it hard: and then the Cold of the Winter cannot so easily\r\n  penetrate, to kill the Roots of the tender Plants.\r\n\r\nIf Wheat were as hardy as Rye, and its Roots as patient of Cold, it\r\nmight, no doubt, be sown in as dry a Season as Rye is, and prosper the\r\nbetter for it, as Rye doth. This will appear, if Wheat and Rye be both\r\nsown in the same dry Season, after the Winter is over.\r\n\r\nBut as Wheat requires to have the Earth lie harder on and about it,\r\nin the Winter; so it also requires more Dung (or somewhat else) to\r\ndissolve the Earth about its Roots, after the cold Winter is past, than\r\nRye doth, whose Roots never were so much confined.\r\n\r\n’Tis another general Rule, that all Sorts of Vegetables thrive best,\r\nwhen sown on fresh till’d Ground, immediately after ’tis plow’d.\r\n\r\nWheat is an Exception to this Rule also; for ’tis better to plow the\r\nGround dry, and let it lie till the Weather moistens it (tho’ it be\r\nseveral Weeks), and then drill the Wheat: The Harrows and the Drill\r\nwill move a sufficient Part of the Ground, which will stick together\r\nfor Defence of the small Roots, during the Winter, the rest of the\r\nMould, lying open, and divided underneath until Spring, to nourish them.\r\n\r\nThere is a Sort of binding Sand, that requires not only to be plow’d\r\ndry, but sow’d dry also; or else the Wheat will dwindle in the Spring,\r\nand fail of being a tolerable Crop.\r\n\r\nBut what I mean by dry Plowing is, not that the Land should always be\r\nso void of Moisture, as that the Dust should fly; but it must not be so\r\nwet, as to stick together[105]. Neither should we drill when the Earth\r\nis wet as Pap; it suffices that it be moist, but moister in light Land\r\nthan in strong Land, when we drill.\r\n\r\n  [105] But the drier ’tis plow’d the better.\r\n\r\nIf the Two Furrows, whereon the treble Row is to stand, be plow’d wet,\r\nthe Earth of the Partitions may grow so hard by the Spring, that the\r\nRoots cannot run freely therein, unless there be Dung to ferment and\r\nkeep it open.\r\n\r\nSo we see, that a steep Bank, made of wet Earth, will lie fast for\r\nseveral Years, when another, made of the same Earth dry, will moulder,\r\nand run down very soon; because its Parts have not the Cohesion that\r\nholds the other together, it continues open, and more porous, and\r\ncrumbles continually down.\r\n\r\nI have seen Trials of this Difference betwixt plowing Dry, and plowing\r\nWet, for planting of Wheat, both in the Old Way, and in the Drilling\r\nWay, but most in the latter; and never saw an Instance where the\r\nDry-Plowing did not outdo the Wet; if the Wheat was not planted thereon\r\nbefore the Earth was become moist enough at Top.\r\n\r\nAnd strong Land, plow’d wet in _November_, will be harder in the\r\nSpring, than if plow’d dry in _August_; tho’ it would then have Three\r\nMonths longer to lie.\r\n\r\nAfter Rain, when the Top of the Ground is of a fit Moisture for\r\nDrilling, harrow it with Two light Harrows, drawn by a Horse going in\r\nthe Furrow betwixt Two Ridges[106]; once will be enough, the Furrow\r\nbeing just broken to level, or rather smooth it for the Drill.\r\n\r\n  [106] Once Harrowing is generally enough, but not always.\r\n\r\nIf the Veerings[107] whereon the next Crop is to stand, be plow’d dry,\r\nwe may drill at any Time during the common and usual Wheat-seed time,\r\nthat is proper for the sort of Wheat to be drill’d, and the sort of\r\nLand, whether that be early or late, we may drill earlier, but not\r\nlater than the sowing Farmers. But I have had good Crops of Wheat\r\ndrill’d at all Times betwixt Harvest and the Beginning of _November_.\r\n\r\n  [107] The Word veering is, I believe, taken from the Seamen, and\r\n  signifies to turn: It is the Ploughman’s Term for turning Two Furrows\r\n  toward each other, as they must do to begin a Ridge: and therefore\r\n  they call the Top of a Ridge a Veering; they call the Two Furrows\r\n  that are turn’d from each other at the Bottom, between Two Ridges, a\r\n  Henting, _i. e._ an Ending: because it makes an End of plowing Ridges.\r\n\r\n  Our Intervals wholly consist of Veerings or Hentings; when Two\r\n  Furrows are turn’d from the Rows, they make a Veering; when turn’d\r\n  towards the Rows, they are a Henting, which is the deep wide Trench\r\n  in the Middle of an Interval.\r\n\r\nFor the Benefit of the middle Rows, ’tis better not to drill Wheat on\r\nstrong Land before the usual Season; because the later ’tis planted,\r\nthe more open the Partitions will be for the Roots of those Rows to run\r\nthrough them in the Spring: and yet, if the Earth of the Partitions\r\nbe plow’d very wet, tho’ late, they may be harder at the Spring, than\r\nthose which are plow’d early and dry.\r\n\r\nThere is a Sort of Wheat call’d by some[108] _Smyrna Wheat_: It has\r\na prodigious large Ear, with many less (or collateral) Ears, coming\r\nall round the Bottom of this Ear; as it is the largest of all Sorts\r\nof Wheat, so it will dispense with the Nourishment of a Garden,\r\nwithout being over-fed, and requires more Nourishment than the common\r\nHusbandry will afford it; for there its Ears grow not much bigger\r\nthan those of common Wheat: This I believe to be, for that Reason, the\r\nvery best Sort for the Hoeing Husbandry; next to this I esteem the\r\nWhite-cone Wheat, then the Grey-cone. I have had very good Crops from\r\nother Sorts; but look upon these to be the best.\r\n\r\n  [108] ’Tis said to grow mostly in some Islands of the _Archipelago_,\r\n  and some Author describes it _Triticum spica multiplici_: There is\r\n  another Sort of Wheat that has many little Ears coming out of Two\r\n  Sides of the main Ear, but this is very late ripe, and doth not\r\n  succeed well here, nor is it liked by them who have sown it; yet I\r\n  have had some Ears of it by chance among my drill’d Wheat, which have\r\n  been larger than those of any common Sort. I have not as yet been\r\n  able to procure any of the _Smyrna Wheat_, which I look on as a great\r\n  Misfortune; but I had some of it above Forty Years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen Wheat is planted early, less Seed is required than when late;\r\nbecause less of it will die in the Winter than of that planted late,\r\nand it has more Time to tiller[109].\r\n\r\n  [109] To _tiller_ is to branch out into many Stalks, and is the\r\n  Country Word, that signifies the same with _fruticare_.\r\n\r\nPoor Land should have more Seed than rich Land, because a less Number\r\nof the Plants will survive the Winter on poor Land.\r\n\r\nThe least Quantity of Seed may suffice for rich Land that is planted\r\nearly; for thereon very few Plants will die; and the Hoe will cause\r\na small Number of Plants to send out a vast Number of Stalks, which\r\nwill have large Ears; and in these, more than in the Number of Plants,\r\nconsists the Goodness of a Crop[110].\r\n\r\n  [110] A too great Number of Plants do neither tiller, nor produce so\r\n  large Ears, nor make half so good a Crop, as a bare competent Number\r\n  of Plants will.\r\n\r\nAnother thing must be consider’d, in order to find the just Proportion\r\nof Seed to plant; and that is, that some Wheat has its Grains twice\r\nas big as other Wheat of the same Sort; and then a Bushel[111] will\r\ncontain but half the Number of Grains; and one Bushel of Small-grain’d\r\nWheat will plant as much Ground as Two Bushels of the Large-grain’d;\r\nfor, in Truth, ’tis not the Measure of the Seed, but the Number of the\r\nGrains, to which respect ought to be had in apportioning the Quantity\r\nof it to the Land.\r\n\r\n  [111] Our Bushel contains Seventy Pounds of the best Wheat.\r\n\r\nSome have thought, that a large Grain of Wheat would produce a larger\r\nPlant than a small Grain; but I have full Experience to the contrary.\r\nThe small Grain, indeed, sends up its first single Blade in Proportion\r\nto its own Bulk, but afterwards becomes as large a Plant, as the\r\nlargest Grain can produce[112], _cæteris paribus_.\r\n\r\n  [112] Farmers in general know this, and choose the thinnest,\r\n  smallest-grained Wheat for Seed; and therefore prefer that which\r\n  is blighted and lodged, and that which grows on new-broken Ground,\r\n  and is not fit for Bread; not only because this thin Wheat has more\r\n  Grains in a Bushel; but also because such Seed is least liable to\r\n  produce a smutty Crop, and yet brings Grains as large as any.\r\n\r\n  I myself have had as full Proofs of this as can possibly be made in\r\n  both Respects.\r\n\r\n  ’Twas from such small Seed that my drill’d _Lammas_ Wheat produced\r\n  the Ears of that monstrous Length described in this Chapter. I never\r\n  saw the like, except in that one Year; and the Grains were large also.\r\n\r\n  And as full Proofs have I seen of thin Seed-wheat escaping the Smut,\r\n  when plump large grain’d Seed of the same Sort have been smutty.\r\n\r\nSix Gallons of middle-siz’d Seed we most commonly drill on an Acre;\r\nyet, on rich Land planted early, Four Gallons may suffice; because then\r\nthe Wheat will have Roots at the Top of the Ground before Winter, and\r\ntiller very much, without Danger of the Worms, and other Accidents,\r\nthat late-planted Wheat is liable to.\r\n\r\nIf it is drill’d too thick, ’twill be in Danger of falling; if too\r\nthin, it may happen to tiller so late in the Spring, that some of the\r\nEars may be blighted; yet a little thicker or thinner does not matter.\r\n\r\nAs to the Depth, we may plant from half an Inch, to three Inches deep;\r\nif planted too deep, there is more Danger of its being eaten off by\r\nWorms, betwixt the Grain and the Blade[113]; for as that Thread is the\r\nThread of Life during the Winter (if not planted early), so the longer\r\nthe Thread is, the more Danger will there be of the Worms[114].\r\n\r\n  [113] A Wheat plant, that is not planted early, sends out no Root\r\n  above the Grain before the Spring; and is nourish’d all the Winter by\r\n  a single Thread, proceeding from the Grain up to the Surface of the\r\n  Ground.\r\n\r\n  [114] Because the Worms can more easily find a Thread, that extends\r\n  by its Length to five or six Inches Depth, than one which reaches but\r\n  One Inch; and besides, the Worms in Winter do not inhabit very near\r\n  the Surface of the Ground; and therefore also miss the short Threads,\r\n  and meet with the long ones.\r\n\r\n’Tis a necessary Caution to beware of the Rooks[115], just as the Wheat\r\nbegins to peep; for before you can perceive it to be coming up, they\r\nwill find it, and dig it up to eat the Grain; therefore you must keep\r\nthem off for a Week or Ten Days; and in that time the Blade will become\r\ngreen, and the Grain so much exhausted of its Flour, that the Rooks\r\nthink it not worth while to dig after it.\r\n\r\n  [115] ’Tis true, that Wheat which is planted early enough for its\r\n  Grain to be unfit for the Rooks, before the Corn that is left on the\r\n  Ground at Harvest is either all eaten by them, or by Swine, or else\r\n  grow’d, plowed in, or otherwise spoiled, is in no Danger: but as this\r\n  sometimes happens soon after Harvest, the Time of which is uncertain,\r\n  a timely Care is necessary.\r\n\r\n  Many are the Contrivances to fright the Rooks; _viz._ To dig an\r\n  Hole in the Ground, and stick Feathers therein; to tear a Rook to\r\n  Pieces, and lay them on divers Parts of the Field: This is sometimes\r\n  effectual; but Kites or other Vermin soon carry away those Pieces.\r\n  Hanging up of dead Rooks is of little Use; for the living will dig\r\n  up the Wheat under the dead ones. A Gun is also of great Use for\r\n  the Purpose; but unless the Field in Time of Danger be constantly\r\n  attended, the Rooks will at one Time or other of the Day do their\r\n  Work, and you may attend often, and yet to no Purpose; for they will\r\n  do great Damage in your Absence.\r\n\r\n  The only Remedy that I have found infallible is a Keeper (a Boy may\r\n  serve very well) to attend from Morning until Night; when he sees\r\n  Rooks either flying over the Field, or alighted in it, he halloos,\r\n  and throws up his Hat, or a dead Rook, into the Air: upon which they\r\n  immediately go off; and ’tis seldom that any one will alight there:\r\n  They, finding there is no Rest for them, seek other Places for their\r\n  Prey, wherein they can feed more undisturbed.\r\n\r\n  This was the Expedient I made use of for preserving my present Crop:\r\n  It succeeded so well, that in Sixscore Acres, I believe there is\r\n  not Two-pence Damage done by the Rooks; but I had two Boys (one at\r\n  Four-pence, and the other at Three-pence a Day) to attend them;\r\n  because my Wheat is on Two Sides of my Farm; the whole Expence was\r\n  about Twenty Shillings. The Damage I received by Rooks the last Year\r\n  in a Field of Seventeen Acres, was more than would have, in this\r\n  manner, preserved my whole Crops for Twenty Years running. I wish I\r\n  could as easily defend my Wheat against Sheep, which are to me a more\r\n  pernicious Vermin than the Rooks.\r\n\r\nBut the Rooks do not molest Wheat that is planted before or a little\r\nafter St. _Michael_; for then there remains Corn enough in the Fields,\r\nwhich is left at Harvest above-ground, that Rooks prefer always before\r\nCorn which must cost them the Labour of digging to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Partitions._\r\n\r\nI have now intirely left out the middle Row for Wheat, and keep only to\r\nthe double Row, for the following Reasons.\r\n\r\nIt makes the cleansing from Weeds more difficult, than when there is\r\nonly a double Row.\r\n\r\nThe Hand-hoe cannot give near so much Nourishment (_i. e._ pulverize\r\nso much Earth) in Two Seven-inch Partitions, as it can in One Ten-inch\r\nPartition.\r\n\r\nThere is Four Inches less Earth to be pulveriz’d by the Horse-hoe from\r\nthe Surface of a Ridge that has Two Seven-inch Partitions, than from a\r\nRidge that hath One Ten-inch Partition.\r\n\r\nThe Ridge must be almost twice as deep in Mould for the treble as for\r\nthe double Row, or else the middle Row will be very weak and poor;\r\nand then, according to the Principles, the whole Ridge will be more\r\nexhausted, than by an equal Product produced by strong Plants.\r\n\r\nAs the Ridges may be much lower that have only the one Partition, so\r\nthe Intervals may be narrower, and yet have as much Earth in them to\r\nbe pulveriz’d, as in wide ones that are betwixt treble Rows; because\r\nthe Four Inches that are in the two Partitions more than in the single\r\nPartition, being on the Top of the Ridge, may have more Mould under\r\nthem than Eight Inches on the Side of a Ridge; and the Four Inches,\r\nbeing in the Partitions, lose the Benefit of Horse-hoeing.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the middle Row as an Alloy, ’tis better to plant such\r\nSorts of Wheat as do not require any Alloy to the double Row; and these\r\nare the _White-cone_, and above all other Sorts the right _Smyrna_.\r\n\r\nThe _White-cone_ Wheat must not be reaped so green as the _Lammas_\r\nWheat may; for if it is not full-ripe, it will be difficult to thresh\r\nit clean out of the Straw.\r\n\r\nIt happened once that my _White-cone_ being planted early, and being\r\nvery high, the Blade and Stalk were kill’d in the Winter; and yet it\r\ngrew high again in the Spring, and had then the same Fortune a Second\r\ntime; it lay on the Ridges like Straw, but sprung out anew from the\r\nRoot, and made a very good Crop at Harvest: Therefore, if the like\r\nAccident should happen, the Owner needs not be frighted at it.\r\n\r\nOne thing that made Six-feet Ridges seem at first necessary, was the\r\ngreat Breadth of the Two Partitions (which were Eight Inches apiece),\r\nwhich, together with the Earth left on each Side of the treble Row\r\nnot well cleansed by Hand-work, made Two large whole Furrows, at the\r\nfirst Plowing for the next Crop, that could not be broken by Harrows:\r\nThese Two strong Furrows, being turned to the Two Furrows that are in\r\nthe middle of a narrow Interval, for making a new Ridge, would cover\r\nalmost all the pulveriz’d Earth, not leaving room betwixt the Two\r\nwhole Furrows for the Drill to go in. But now the single Partition,\r\nand the Earth left by the Hoe-Plough, on the Outsides of the double\r\nRow, making Two narrow Furrows, and the one Partition being cleansed,\r\nand deeper Hand-ho’d than those of the treble Row were, or could be,\r\nare easily broken by the Harrows; for, besides their Narrowness, they\r\nhave no Roots to hold their Mould together, except the Wheat-roots,\r\nwhich, being small and dead, have not Strength enough to hold it; and\r\ntherefore that Necessity of such broad Ridges now ceases along with the\r\ntreble Row.\r\n\r\nWhen the Two narrow fragile Furrows are harrowed, and mixed with the\r\npulveriz’d Earth of the Intervals, the Roots of the Wheat will reach\r\nit; and it is no Matter whether the Crop be drill’d after Two Plowings,\r\nin which Case the Row will stand on the very same Place whereon the Row\r\nstood the precedent Year, or whether it be drill’d after One or Three\r\nPlowings; and then the Rows will stand on the Middle of the last Year’s\r\nIntervals.\r\n\r\nI cannot prescribe precisely the most proper Width of all Intervals;\r\nbecause they should be different in different Circumstances. In deep\r\nrich Land they may be a little narrower than in shallow Land.\r\n\r\nThere must be (as has been said) a competent Quantity of Earth in them\r\nto be pulveriz’d; and, when the Soil is rich, the less will suffice.\r\n\r\nNever let the Intervals be too wide to be Horse-hoed at Two Furrows,\r\nwithout leaving any Part unplowed in the Middle of them, when the\r\nFurrows are turned towards the Rows.\r\n\r\nSome Ploughmen can plow a wider Furrow than others, that do not\r\nunderstand the letting of the Hoe-Plough so well, can.\r\n\r\nBy making the Plank of the Hoe-plough shorter, and the Limbers more\r\ncrooked, we can now hoe in narrower Intervals than formerly, without\r\ndoing any Damage to the Wheat.\r\n\r\nI now choose to have Fourteen Ridges on an Acre, and one only Partition\r\nof Ten Inches on each of them. This I find answers all the Ends I\r\npurpose. If the Partitions are narrower, there is not sufficient room\r\nin them for the Hand-hoe to do its work effectually; if wider, too\r\nmuch Earth will lose the Benefit of the Horse-hoe.\r\n\r\nThe poorer the Soil is, the more Pulveration will be necessary to it.\r\n\r\nWhen a great Season of Wheat is drill’d, it cannot be expected that\r\nmuch of it can be plowed dry, tho’ it is advantageous when there\r\nhappens an Opportunity for doing it; but by long Experience I find,\r\nthat in most of my Lands it does very well, when plowed in a moderate\r\nTemper of Moisture.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to harrow it once after it is drill’d, which will,\r\nin some Measure, disappoint the Rooks; besides covering the Wheat, if,\r\nperchance, any should miss being covered by the Drill-harrow.\r\n\r\nBut these, and all Harrows that go on a Ridge, both before and after\r\nit is drill’d, should be very light, and fastened together in the\r\ncommon Manner; except that the Pole must be fastened to each Harrow in\r\ntwo Places; which keeps them both as level as if they were One single\r\nHarrow: Otherwise the Ridges would be too sharp at the Top, and the\r\nPartitions would lie higher than the Rows, and some of their Earth\r\nwould be apt to fall on the Rows when it is Hand-hoed.\r\n\r\nBy Means of this level Harrowing, there is left an open Furrow in the\r\nMiddle of the Interval, which much facilitates the First Horse-hoeing.\r\n\r\nBut when, after a Crop is taken off, the Ridges are plowed twice, as\r\nthey may be where the one Partition hath been well Hand-ho’d; ’tis\r\nbetter to harrow the first-made Ridges in the common Manner; because\r\nthen some of the fine Earth, that is harrow’d down, will reach to the\r\nmiddle of the Intervals whereon the Ridges are to be made for Drilling:\r\nOr if there should be time for plowing thrice, the Ridges of the First\r\nand Second Plowings are to be harrow’d in the common Manner also.\r\n\r\nThe Harrowing of Ridges must never be cross-ways, unless they are to\r\nbe made level for Cross-plowing, in order to lay out the Ridges of a\r\nBreadth different to what they were of before.\r\n\r\nWhen you perceive the Ridges are too high, harrow them lower by the\r\ndescribed manner of Harrowing; first with the heavy Harrows for\r\nharrowing out the Stubble, and then with light ones, which may be\r\noften, for making the Earth on the Ridges the finer for Drilling,\r\nwithout throwing much of it down; frequent Harrowings in this manner,\r\nnot being injurious like too much Harrowing on level Ground, which\r\nis sometimes trodden as hard as the Highway by the Cattle that draw\r\nthe Harrows; for in harrowing these Ridges, the Beast draws the Two\r\nHarrows, and always treads in the Furrow between them where there is\r\nnone or very little Mould to tread on.\r\n\r\nThe Price of Hand-hoeing of these double Rows is a Peny for thirty\r\nPerches in Length of Row, which amounts to between Eighteen and\r\nNineteen Pence for an Acre.\r\n\r\nI should say, that in Hand-hoeing the Earth must never be turned\r\ntowards the Wheat; for, if it were, it might crush it when young;\r\nneither could the Partition be clean hoed.\r\n\r\nThe Hand-hoes for hoeing the Ten-inch Partition have their Edges Seven\r\nInches long; they are about Four Inches deep from the Handle; if they\r\nwere deeper, they would be too weak; for they must be thin, and well\r\nsteeled. The Labourers pay for them, and keep them in Order, for their\r\nown Use.\r\n\r\nThese Hoes must not cut out any Part of the Two Rows, nor be drawn\r\nthrough them, as the Four-inch Hoes sometimes may through the treble\r\nRows.\r\n\r\nIf I am taxed with Levity in changing my treble Rows for double ones,\r\nit will not appear to be done of a sudden. In _p._ 132. I advised the\r\nTrial of both Sorts: And now, upon fuller Experience, I find the\r\ndouble Rows much preferable to the treble, especially for Wheat.\r\n\r\nWhen Gentlemen saw the middle Row on low Ridges so much inferior to the\r\noutside Rows, they were convinced of the Effect of deep Hoeing; for\r\nthey said, there was no other Reason for this so visible a Difference,\r\nexcept the outside Rows standing nearer to the pulveriz’d Intervals\r\nthan the middle Row did.\r\n\r\nAnd when on high Ridges the middle Row was nearly or quite as good\r\nas one of the outside Rows, I was not convinced, that they were not\r\ndiminished by the middle Row, as much as the Produce of it amounted\r\nto: And this I now find to be the Case; for Four Rows of Oats, without\r\na middle Row, produced somewhat more than the same Number that had a\r\nmiddle Row; Two of which treble Rows were taken on one Side, and Two on\r\nthe other Side of the double Rows, purposely to make an unexceptionable\r\nTrial. And it is, as far as I can judge, the same in Wheat.\r\n\r\n’Tis true, I began my Horse-hoeing _Scheme_ first with double Rows;\r\nbut then they were different to what they are now; for the first had\r\ntheir Partition uneven, being the parting Space, whereby it was less\r\nproper for Hand-hoeing, which I then seldom used, except for absolute\r\nNecessity, as to cleanse our Poppies, and the like. The Intervals also\r\nwere too narrow for constant annual Crops.\r\n\r\nBy all these Three Methods I have had very good Crops; but as this\r\nI now describe is the latest, and is (as it ought to be) the best;\r\nI publish it as such, without Partiality to my own Opinions; for I\r\nthink it less dishonourable to expose my Errors, when I chance to\r\ndetect them, than to conceal them: And as I aim at nothing but Truth,\r\nI cannot, with any Satisfaction to myself, suffer any thing of my own\r\nknowingly to escape, that is in the lead contrary to it.\r\n\r\nI have a Piece of Five or Six Acres of Land which I annually plant\r\nwith boiling Pease, in the very same manner as Wheat; except that the\r\nSecond Horse-hoeing (which is the last) throws the Earth so far upon\r\nthe Pease as to make the Two Rows become One. These Pease cannot be\r\nplanted until after the 25th of _March_; else Two Horse-hoeings might\r\nnot be sufficient. The same Drill that plants Wheat plants Pease; only\r\nsometimes we change the Spindle for one that has its Notches a little\r\nbigger.\r\n\r\nI drill no more Barley, because ’tis not proper to be followed by a\r\nCrop of Wheat without a Fallow; for some of the shattered Barley will\r\nlive over the Winter, and mix with the Wheat in the Rows, and can\r\nscarce possibly be thence timely taken out, its first Stalk and Blade\r\nbeing difficult to distinguish from the Wheat; and this is a great\r\nDamage to the Sale in the Market; and for the same Reason I plant no\r\nmore Oats.\r\n\r\nThe First Hoeing is performed by turning a Furrow from the Row.\r\n\r\nWe are not so exact as to the Weather in the First Hoeing; for if the\r\nEarth be wet, the Hoe-plough may go nearer to the Row, without burying\r\nthe Wheat; and the Frost of the Winter will pulverize that Part of\r\nthe[116] Furrow, which is to be thrown to the Wheat in the Spring,\r\naltho’ it was hoed wet.\r\n\r\n  [116] The Word Furrow signifies the Earth that is thrown out, as well\r\n  as the Trench from whence it is thrown by the Plough.\r\n\r\nNeither is it necessary to be very exact as to Time; but it must never\r\nbe till the Wheat has more than One Blade; and it may be soon enough,\r\nwhen it has Four or Five Leaves, so that it is done before[117], or in\r\nthe Beginning of Winter.\r\n\r\n  [117] But if the Wheat is planted very late, it may not be _hoeable_\r\n  before the Winter is past; nor is there such a Necessity of hoeing\r\n  the late planted before the great Frosts are over, as there is of the\r\n  early-planted; for the later ’tis planted, the less time the Earth\r\n  has to subside, and grow hard.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, By Winter we do not mean only those Months that are properly\r\n  so reckoned, but also such other Months as have hard Frosts in them,\r\n  as _January_, _February_, and sometimes the Beginning of _March_.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Fault you can commit in Hoeing, is the First Time, when\r\nthe Furrow is turned from the Row, not to go near enough to it, nor\r\ndeep enough. You cannot then go too near it, unless you plow it out, or\r\nbury it with Mould, and do not uncover it; nor too deep, unless you go\r\nbelow the Staple of the Ground.\r\n\r\nServants are apt to hoe too far from the Rows, going backwards and\r\nforwards, in the Middle of the Intervals, without coming near the Rows:\r\nThis loses most of the Benefit of Hoeing, and is very injurious to the\r\npresent Crop, and also to the Two succeeding Crops; for then there will\r\nbe a Deficiency of pulverized Earth; and nobody can suppose, that the\r\nhoed Earth can be of any Benefit to the Rows, before the Roots reach\r\ninto it; and when ’tis far off, few of the Roots reach it at all; and\r\nthose that do reach, come there too late to bring the Plants to their\r\nfull Perfection: Therefore, if the First Furrow was not near enough,\r\nnor deep enough, plow a Second Furrow at the Bottom of the former,\r\nwhich will go deeper than the First, and break the Earth more; besides\r\ntaking away from the Rows such unmoved Ground, which the First Plowing\r\nmay possibly have missed. If this can’t be conveniently done soon after\r\nthe First Hoeing, do it before the Ridge is turned back in the Spring.\r\n\r\nAlways leave the Furrows turned up, to make[118] Ridges in the Middle\r\nof the Intervals during the Winter; and then the hollow Furrows,\r\nor Trenches next the Rows, being enriched by the Frost[119] and\r\nRains[120], the Wheat will have the Benefit of them earlier in the\r\nSpring, than if the Trenches had been left open in the Middle of the\r\nIntervals.\r\n\r\n  [118] Tho’ the Ridge in the Middle of the Interval should, for Want\r\n  of sufficient Mould, or otherwise, be too low to give Shelter, yet\r\n  there is generally some Earth falls to the Left of the Hoe-plough,\r\n  and lodges upon that Part which is left on the Outside of the Row;\r\n  which, notwithstanding that Part be very narrow (as suppose Two or\r\n  Three Inches), yet a small Quantity of Earth lying thereon, so near\r\n  to the outside Row, gives an extraordinary Shelter to the young Wheat\r\n  plants that grow in it.\r\n\r\n  Shelter is a great Benefit to Wheat; but yet Nourishment is more: for\r\n  in the Winter I see the Wheat-plants upon the most exposed Part of\r\n  the Ridge flourish, when single Plants in the Bottom of the Furrow\r\n  are in a very poor languishing Condition, without any Annoyance of\r\n  Water, they being upon a Chalk Bottom.\r\n\r\n  [119] Frost, if it does not kill the Wheat, is of great Benefit to\r\n  it; Water or Moisture, when it is frozen in the Earth, takes up more\r\n  Room than in its natural State; this Swelling of the Ice (which is\r\n  Water congealed) must move and break the Earth wherewith it is mixt;\r\n  and when it thaws, the Earth is left hollow and open, which is a\r\n  kind of Hoeing to it. This Benefit is done chiefly to and near the\r\n  Surface; consequently the more Surface there is, by the Unevenness of\r\n  the Land, the more Advantage the Soil has from the Frost.\r\n\r\n  This is another very great Use of the Ridge left in the Middle of\r\n  the Interval during the Winter; because that Ridge, and its Two\r\n  Furrows, contain Four Times as much Surface as when level. This\r\n  thus pulverized Surface, turned in in the Spring hoeing, enriches\r\n  the Earth, in proportion to its Increase of internal Superficies,\r\n  and likewise proportionably nourishes the Plants, whose Roots enter\r\n  it; and that Part of it wherein they do not enter, must remain more\r\n  enriched for the next Crop, than if the Soil had remained level all\r\n  the Winter.\r\n\r\n  [120] It is a vulgar Error that the Winter Rains do not enrich the\r\n  Earth; and is only thought so, because we do not see the Effect of\r\n  them upon Vegetables, for lack of Heat in that Season. But some\r\n  Farmers have frequently observed, that one half of a Ground plowed up\r\n  just before Winter has produced a Crop of Barley as much better than\r\n  the other Part plowed up at the End of Winter, as is the Difference\r\n  of a Dunging, even when there has been very little Frost.\r\n\r\nThe outside Rows of Wheat, from which the Earth is hoed off before or\r\nin the Beginning of Winter, and left almost bare till the Spring, one\r\nwould think should suffer by the Frost coming so near them[121], or for\r\nwant of Pasture: But it appears to be quite contrary; for where the Hoe\r\nhas gone nearest to a Row, its Plants thrive best: The Earth, which the\r\nFrost hath pulverized, being within the Reach of the young short Roots,\r\non that Side of the Row, from the Top to the Bottom of the Trench,\r\nnourishes them at first; and before the Plants have much exhausted\r\nthis, as they grow larger in the Spring, the Ridge from the Middle of\r\nthe Interval is thrown to them, having a perfectly unexhausted Pasture,\r\nto supply their increasing Bulk with more Nourishment.\r\n\r\n  [121] In very light Land, perhaps, we must not hoe quite so near to\r\n  the Rows of Wheat, as in strong Land, for fear the Winter should lay\r\n  the Roots bare, and expose them too much to the Cold; but then we may\r\n  be sure, that, in this Case, the Roots will reach the Interval at a\r\n  greater Distance than in strong Land; yet such very light Land is not\r\n  proper for Wheat.\r\n\r\nThe Row standing as it were on the Brink of this almost perpendicular\r\nDitch, the Water runs off quickly, or doth not enter but a very little\r\nWay into this deep Side; so that, the Earth at the Plants being dry,\r\nthe Frost doth not reach quite to all their Roots to hurt them, tho’\r\nthe Distance from the Air to the Roots be very short; and dry Earth\r\ndoth not freeze as wet doth, neither is this Ditch much exposed to the\r\ncold Winds.\r\n\r\nThe Spring-hoeing is performed after the great Frosts are past, and\r\nwhen the Weather will allow it; and then turn[122] the Ridge from[123]\r\nthe Middle of the Interval, to the Rows on each Side by Two Furrows as\r\nnear as can be, without covering the Wheat; in doing which have regard\r\nto the Row only, without looking at the Middle of the Interval; for\r\n’tis no matter if a little Earth be left there; the next Hoeing, or the\r\nnext save one[124], will move it.\r\n\r\n  [122] ’Tis an errant Mistake of the Vulgar, when they imagine that\r\n  the immediate Benefit of fresh Earth to Plants is from that Part\r\n  which remains uppermost; for ’tis from turning the impregnated\r\n  pulverized Side downwards, to be fed on by the Roots, that gives the\r\n  _Pabulum_ or Nourishment of the fresh Earth to Plants: The other\r\n  Side, being turned upwards, becomes impregnate also in a little time.\r\n\r\n  [123] But note, that when we see Weeds coming up near the Row in the\r\n  Spring, we plow again from the Rows (and sometimes can plow within\r\n  one Inch of the Row) before we turn down the Mould from the Middle of\r\n  the Interval.\r\n\r\n  [124] If at the next Hoeing we turn another Furrow towards the Row\r\n  (which is seldom done), then ’tis the next that moves the remaining\r\n  Earth, left in the Middle of the Interval: But if the next Hoeing be\r\n  from the Row (as it generally is), then that covers the Middle of the\r\n  Interval; and then ’tis the next Hoeing after that, that turns all\r\n  the Earth clean out of the Middle of the Interval toward the Rows.\r\n\r\nAs to how many times Wheat is to be hoed in the Summer, after this\r\nSpring Operation, it depends upon the Circumstances[125] and Condition\r\nof the Land[126] and Weather[127]; but be the Season as it will, never\r\nsuffer the Weeds to grow high, nor let any unmoved Earth lie in the\r\nMiddle of the Intervals long enough to grow hard; neither plow deep\r\nnear the Rows in the Summer, when the Plants are large[128], but as\r\ndeep in the Middle of the Intervals as the Staple will allow; turning\r\nthe Earth towards the Wheat, especially at the last Hoeing, so as to\r\nleave a deep, wide Trench in the Middle of each Interval.\r\n\r\n  [125] If the Land was not sufficiently tilled or hoed in the\r\n  precedent Year, it will require the more Hoeings in the following\r\n  Year.\r\n\r\n  [126] The poorer the Land is, the more Hoeings it should have.\r\n\r\n  [127] A wet Summer may prevent some of the Hoeings that we should\r\n  perform in a dry Summer.\r\n\r\n  [128] Our Hoeing deep near the Plants, when small, breaks off only\r\n  the Ends of the Roots; but after the Roots are spread far in the\r\n  interval, the greatest Part of them, being then on the Right-hand\r\n  Side of the Hoe plough, might hold fast on that Side, and not be\r\n  drawn out; and then the whole Roots would be broken off close to the\r\n  Bodies of the Plants: Therefore at the Second deep Hoeing, that turns\r\n  a Furrow from the Row in the Summer, we go about Four or Six Inches\r\n  farther off from the Roots than the time before; but we go nearer\r\n  or farther off, according to the Distance of Time between those Two\r\n  Hoeings: Yet we may hoe _shallow_ near to the Plants at any time,\r\n  without Injury to their Roots, but, on the contrary, it will be\r\n  advantageous to them.\r\n\r\nWe augment our Wheat-crops Four Ways; not in Number of Plants, but in\r\nStalks, Ears, and Grains.\r\n\r\nThe First is, by increasing the Number of Stalks from One, Two, or\r\nThree, to Thirty or Forty to a Plant, in ordinary Field-land.\r\n\r\nAnd we augment the Crop, by bringing up all the Stalks into Ears, which\r\nis the Second Way; for, if it be diligently observed, we shall find,\r\nthat not half[129] the Stalks of sown Wheat come into Ear.\r\n\r\n  [129] If a square Yard of sown Wheat be marked out, and the Stalks\r\n  thereon numbered in the Spring, it will be found, that Nine parts in\r\n  Ten are missing at Harvest.\r\n\r\nI saw an Experiment of this in Rows of Wheat that were equally poor:\r\nOne of these Rows was increased[130] so much, as to produce more Grains\r\nthan Ten of the other, by bringing up more of its Stalks into Ears, and\r\nalso by augmenting its Ears to a much greater Bigness; which is the\r\nThird Way: For, whatever _Varro_ means by saying, that the Ears remain\r\nFifteen Days _in Vaginis_, ’tis pretty plain, that the Ears are formed\r\ntogether with the Stalks, and will be very large, or very small, in\r\nproportion to the Nourishment given them[131].\r\n\r\n  [130] These Rows were drilled a Foot asunder, not hoed; and were, by\r\n  the Shallowness and Wetness of the Soil, very poor in the Spring; and\r\n  then, by pouring Urine to the Bottom of this Row, it was so vastly\r\n  increased above the rest.\r\n\r\n  [131] Like as the Vines, if well nourished, bring large Bunches of\r\n  Grapes; but if ill nourished, they produce few Bunches, and those\r\n  small ones; and many Claspers are formed, which would have been\r\n  Bunches, if they had had sufficient Nourishment given them at the\r\n  proper time.\r\n\r\nThe last and Fourth Way of augmenting the Produce of Wheat-plants, is\r\nby causing them to have large and plump Grains in the Ears; and this\r\ncan no way be so effectually done as by late Hoeing, especially just\r\nafter the Wheat is gone out of the Blossom; and when such hoed Grains\r\nweigh double the Weight of the same Number of unhoed (which they\r\nfrequently will) tho’ the Number of Grains in the hoed are only equal,\r\nyet the hoed Crop must be double.\r\n\r\nThus, by increasing the Number of Stalks[132], bringing more of them up\r\ninto Ear[133], making the Ears larger[134], and the Grain plumper, and\r\nfuller of Flour[135], the Hoeing Method makes a greater Crop from a\r\nTenth Part of the Plants[136] than the sowing Method can.\r\n\r\n  [132] The same Plant that, when poor, sends out but Two or Three\r\n  Tillers, would, if well nourished by the Hoe, or otherwise, send up a\r\n  Multitude of Tillers, as is seen in hoed Wheat, and sown Wheat.\r\n\r\n  [133] Mr. _Houghton_ relates Eighty Ears on one single Plant of\r\n  Wheat, and a greater Number has been counted lately in a Garden:\r\n  Those Eighty, reckoned to have Fifty Grains apiece, make an Increase\r\n  of Four thousand Grains for one; but I have never found above Forty\r\n  Ears from a single Plant in my Fields; yet there is no doubt, but\r\n  that every Plant would produce as many as Mr. _Houghton_’s, of the\r\n  same Sort, with the same Nourishment; But I should not desire any\r\n  to be so prolific in Stalks, lest they should fail of bringing such\r\n  a Multitude of Ears to Perfection. The Four hundred Ears, that I\r\n  numbered in a Yard, were not weighed, because they were told before\r\n  ripe; and the greatest Weight of Wheat that ever I had from a Yard,\r\n  was the Product of about Two hundred and Fifty Ears, and some of them\r\n  were small.\r\n\r\n  [134] I have numbered One hundred and Nine Grains in One Ear of my\r\n  hoed Cone-wheat of the grey Sort; and One Ear of my hoed Lammas-wheat\r\n  has been measured to be Eight Inches long, which is double to those\r\n  of sown Wheat. I have some of these Ears now by me almost as long,\r\n  the longest being given away as a Rarity; and indeed ’tis not every\r\n  Year that they grow to that Length, and ’tis always where the Plants\r\n  are pretty single. But there is no Year wherein One Ear of my hoed\r\n  does not more than weigh Two of the sown Ears, taking a whole Sheaf\r\n  of each together without choosing. The Sheaves of the hoed are of a\r\n  different Shape from the other; almost all the Ears of the hoed are\r\n  at the Top of the Sheaf; but most of the other are situate at the\r\n  lower Part, or near the Middle of the Sheaf.\r\n\r\n  [135] Seed Cone wheat coming all out at the same Heap, planted all at\r\n  the same Time, and on Land of the same Sort adjoining near together,\r\n  the Wheat that was sown produced Grains so small, and that which was\r\n  drilled so very large, that no Farmer or Wheat-buyer would believe\r\n  them to be of the same Sort of Wheat, except those who knew it, which\r\n  were many. One Grain of the drilled weighed Two of the sown, and\r\n  there was twice the Chaff in an equal Weight of the sown, being both\r\n  weighed before and after the Wheat was separated from the Chaff.\r\n\r\n  [136] The Fact of this nobody can doubt, who has observed the\r\n  different Products of strong and of weak Plants, how the one exceeds\r\n  the other.\r\n\r\n  The greatest Difference of having an equal Crop from a small Number\r\n  of strong Plants, and from a great Number of weak ones, is, that the\r\n  Soil is vastly less exhausted by the former than by the latter, not\r\n  only from the latter’s exhausting more in proportion to their Number\r\n  when young, and whilst each of them consumes as much Nourishment as\r\n  each of the small Number; but also from the different Increase that\r\n  a strong Plant makes by receiving the same Proportion of Food with a\r\n  weak one: For it appears from Dr. _Woodward_’s Experiments, that the\r\n  Plant which receives the _least_ Increase carries off the _greatest_\r\n  Quantity of Nourishment in proportion to that Increase; and that\r\n  ’tis the same with an Animal, all who are acquainted with fatting of\r\n  Swine know; for they eat much more Food daily for the first Two Weeks\r\n  of their being put into the Sty, than they do afterwards, when they\r\n  thrive faster; the fatter they grow, the less they eat.\r\n\r\n  Hence, I think, it may be inferred, that a Plant, which, by never\r\n  having been robbed or stinted by other Plants, is strong, receives a\r\n  much greater Increase from an equal Quantity of Food, than a Number\r\n  of weak Plants (as thick ones are), equalling the Bulk of the single\r\n  strong Plant, do.\r\n\r\n  And this of the Doctor’s have I seen by my own Observations confirmed\r\n  in the Field in Potatoes, Turneps, Wheat, and Barley; a following\r\n  Crop succeeds better after an equal Crop, consisting of a bare\r\n  competent Number of strong Plants, than after a Crop of thick weak\r\n  ones, _cæteris paribus_.\r\n\r\n  Thus the hoed Crops, if well managed, consisting of fewer and\r\n  stronger Plants than the sown Crops of equal Produce, exhaust the\r\n  Ground less; whereby, and by the much (I had almost said infinitely)\r\n  greater Pulveration of the Soil, indifferent good Land may, for any\r\n  thing I have yet seen to the contrary, produce profitable Crops\r\n  always without Manure, or Change of _Species_, if the Soil be\r\n  proper for it in respect of Heat and Moisture; and also as Crops of\r\n  some _Species_, by their living longer, by their greater Bulk, or\r\n  different Constitution, exhaust more than others, respect ought to be\r\n  had to the Degree of Richness of the Soil, that is to produce each\r\n  _Species_: The Sowing and the Hoeing Husbandry differ so much both in\r\n  Pulveration and Exhaustion, that no good Argument can be drawn from\r\n  the former against the latter: But tho’ a too great Number of Plants\r\n  be, upon many Accounts, very injurious to the Crop, yet ’tis best to\r\n  have a competent Number; which yet needs not be so exact, but that we\r\n  may expect a great Crop from Twenty, Forty, or Fifty Plants in a Yard\r\n  of the treble Row, if well managed.\r\n\r\nAll these Advantages will be lost by those Drillers, who do not\r\novercome the unreasonable Prejudices of the unexperienced, concerning\r\nthe Width of Intervals.\r\n\r\nIn wide Intervals, we can raise a good Crop with less Labour, less\r\nSeed, no Dung, no Fallow, but not without a competent Quantity of\r\nEarth, which is the least expensive of any thing given to Corn; the\r\nEarth of a whole good Acre being but about the Tenth Part of the common\r\nExpence; and of indifferent Land, a Twentieth; and such I count that of\r\nFive Shillings and Six-pence _per_ Acre.\r\n\r\nThe Crop enjoys all the Earth; for betwixt the last Hoeing, and the\r\nHarvest, there remains nothing but Space empty of Mould in the Middle\r\nof the Intervals.\r\n\r\n’Tis an Objection, that great Part of those wide Intervals must\r\nbe lost[137], because the Wheat-roots do not reach it; but as we\r\ngenerally turn the Mould towards the Row at the last Hoeings, there is\r\nno Part of it above Two Feet distant from even the middle Row, and\r\nSeventeen Inches from either of the outside Rows.\r\n\r\n  [137] They do reach through all the Mould (as shall be proved\r\n  by-and-by); and yet may leave sufficient Pasture behind; because it\r\n  is impossible for them to come into Contact with all the Mould in\r\n  One Year; no more than when Ten Horses are put into an Hundred Acres\r\n  of good Pasture, their Mouths come into Contact with all the Grass\r\n  to eat it in one Summer, though they will go all over it, as the\r\n  Vine-roots go all over the Soil of a Vineyard without exhausting it\r\n  all; because those Roots feed only such a bare competent Quantity of\r\n  Plants, which do not overstock their Pasture.\r\n\r\n  The Superficies of the fibrous Roots of a proper Number of\r\n  Wheat-plants bear a very small Proportion to the Superficies of the\r\n  fine Parts of the pulverized Earth they feed on in these Intervals;\r\n  for one cubical Foot of this Earth may, as is shewn in _p._ 29. have\r\n  many thousand Feet of internal Superficies: But this is in proportion\r\n  to the Degree of its Pulveration: and that Degree may be such as is\r\n  sufficient to maintain a competent Number of Wheat-plants, without\r\n  over-exhausting the vegetable Pasture, but not sufficient to maintain\r\n  those, and a great Stock of Weeds besides, without over-exhausting\r\n  it. And this was plainly seen in a Field of Wheat drilled on\r\n  _Six-feet_ Ridges, when the South Ends of some of the Ridges, and the\r\n  North Ends of others, had their Partitions Hand hoed, and cleansed\r\n  of Weeds, early in the Spring, the opposite Ends remaining full of a\r\n  small _Species_ of Weeds, called _Crow-needles_, which so exhausted\r\n  the whole Intervals of the weedy Part of the Ridges, that the next\r\n  Year the whole Field being drilled again with Wheat exactly in\r\n  the Middle of the last Intervals, the following Crop very plainly\r\n  distinguished how far each Ridge had its Partitions made clean of\r\n  those small Weeds in the Spring, from the other End where the Weeds\r\n  remained till full-grown; the Crop of the former was twice as good as\r\n  that of the latter, even where both were cleansed of Weeds the next\r\n  _Spring_. This Crop standing only upon that Part of the Mould, which\r\n  was farthest from the Rows of the precedent Crop, proves that the\r\n  Roots, both of the Wheat and Weeds, did enter all the Earth of the\r\n  former Intervals.\r\n\r\n  It was also observable, that where the Partitions of Two of the\r\n  Six-feet Ridges had been in the precedent Year cleansed of Weeds,\r\n  and those of the adjoining Ridges on each Side of them not cleansed,\r\n  the Row that was the next Year planted exactly in the Middle of the\r\n  Interval between those two Ridges, was perceivably better than either\r\n  of the Two Rows planted in the Intervals on the other Side of each\r\n  of them: The Reason of which Difference must be, that the Middle of\r\n  the Interval, that was between the Two cleansed Ridges, was fed on by\r\n  the Wheat only, and by no Weeds; but the other Two Intervals were fed\r\n  on by the Wheat on one Side, and by both the Wheat and Weeds on the\r\n  other Side of each.\r\n\r\n  There were, in the same Field, several Ridges together, that had\r\n  the Ends of their Rows of Wheat plowed out by the Hoe-plough, and\r\n  their other Ends cleansed of Weeds: This was done on purpose, to\r\n  see what Effect a Fallow would have on the next Crop, which was\r\n  indeed extraordinary; for these fallowed Ends of the Ridges, being\r\n  Horse-hoed in the Summer, as the other Ends were, and the Intervals\r\n  of them made into Ridges, the following Year produced the largest\r\n  Crop of all; this Crop was received in 1734.\r\n\r\n  These several different Managements performed in this Field, shewed\r\n  by the different Success of the Crops in each Sort, what ought to be\r\n  done, and which is the best Sort of Management.\r\n\r\n  This Field indeed is some of my best Land; and by all the Experiments\r\n  I have seen on it, I do not find but that, by the best Management,\r\n  never omitted in any Year, it might produce good annual Crops of\r\n  Wheat always, without Assistance of Dung or Fallow; but it would\r\n  be very difficult for me to get Hands to do this to the greatest\r\n  Perfection, unless I were able constantly to attend them.\r\n\r\n  The whole pulverized Earth of the Interval being pretty equally fed\r\n  on by the former Crop, ’tis no great Matter in what Part of it the\r\n  following Crop is drill’d: I never drill it but on the Middle of the\r\n  last Year’s Interval, because there is the Trench whereon the next\r\n  Year’s Ridge is made with the greatest Conveniency: But there may\r\n  be some Reason to suspect, that the Plants of the Rows exhaust more\r\n  Nourishment from that Earth of the Intervals which is farthest from\r\n  their Bodies, than from that which is nearest to them: Since their\r\n  fibrous Roots, at the greatest Distance from the Rows, are most\r\n  numerous, _&c._ by these the Plants, when they are at their greatest\r\n  Bulk, are chiefly maintained.\r\n\r\n  It must be _noted_, that the above Experiments would not have been\r\n  a full Proof, if Weeds had been suffered to grow in the Partitions\r\n  of the Ends of those Ridges, in the Year wherein the Difference\r\n  appeared. It may also be _noted_, that a Mixture and Variety of bad\r\n  Husbandry are useful for a Discovery of the _Theory_ and _Practice_\r\n  of good Husbandry.\r\n\r\nAnd I have plainly proved, that the Roots of Cone-wheat have reached\r\nMould at Two Feet Distance, after passing through another Row at a Foot\r\nDistance from it, the Plants being then but Eighteen Inches high, and\r\nbut half-grown.\r\n\r\nFarmers do not grudge to bestow Three or Four Pounds in the Buying\r\nand Carriage of Dung for an Acre; but think themselves undone, if\r\nthey afford an extraordinary Eighteen-penyworth of Earth to the wide\r\nIntervals of an Acre; not considering that Earth is not only the best,\r\nbut also the cheapest Entertainment that can be given to Plants; for\r\nat Five Shillings and Six-pence Rent, the whole Earth belonging to each\r\nof our Rows costs only Six-pence, _i. e._ a Peny for a Foot broad, and\r\nSix hundred and Sixty Feet long; that being the Sixty-sixth Part of an\r\nAcre[138].\r\n\r\n  [138] But the Vulgar compute this Expence of a Foot Breadth of\r\n  Ground, not only as of the Rent, as they ought, but as an Eleventh\r\n  Part of their own usual Charges added to the Rent.\r\n\r\n  And there is Land enough in _England_ to be had, at the Rent of Five\r\n  Shillings and Six-pence the Acre, that is very proper for Wheat in\r\n  the Hoeing-Husbandry.\r\n\r\nAnd if for constant annual Wheat-crops you make fewer than Eleven\r\nRows on Four Perches Breadth, you will always increase the Expence of\r\nHoeing; because then Two Furrows will not Hoe One of those Intervals,\r\nand you will also thereby lessen the Crops, but improve the Land more:\r\nAnd if you increase that Number of Rows, you will thereby increase\r\nevery Expence; for there must be Two Furrows to hoe a narrow Interval,\r\nand an Increase of the Quantity of Seed, and the Labour in uncovering,\r\nweeding, and reaping; and also you will less improve the Land, and\r\nlessen the Crops after the First Year.\r\n\r\nIf the Intervals are narrower in deep Land, tho’ there might be Mould\r\nenough in them, yet there would not be Room to pulverize it.\r\n\r\nIf narrower in shallow Land, tho’ there were Room, yet there would not\r\nbe Mould enough in them to be pulverized.\r\n\r\nThe Horse-hoe, well applied, doth supply the Use of Dung and Fallow;\r\nbut it cannot supply the Use of Earth, tho’ it can infinitely increase\r\nthe vegetable Pasture of it, by pulverizing it, where it is in a\r\nreasonable Quantity: Yet if the Intervals be so narrow, that near all\r\nthe Earth of them goes to make the Partitions raised at the Top of the\r\nRidges, there will be so little to be pulverized, that you must return\r\nto Fallowing, and to the Dung-cart, and to all the old exorbitant\r\nCharges[139].\r\n\r\n  [139] The Objections against these wide Intervals are only for saving\r\n  a Penyworth or Two of Earth in each Row, or a few Groats-worth of it\r\n  in an Acre; by saving of which Earth they may lose, in the present\r\n  and succeeding Crops, more Pounds.\r\n\r\nEight Acres, Part of a Ground of Twenty Acres, drilled with Intervals\r\nof Three Feet and an half, brought a good Crop; but the Second Year,\r\nnot being hoed, the Crop was poor; and the Third Crop made that Land so\r\nfoul and turfy, that ’twas forced to lie for a Fallow, there being no\r\nway to bring it into Tilth without a Summer-plowing[140], when the rest\r\nof the same Piece, in wider Intervals, being constantly hoed, continued\r\nin good Tilth, and never failed to yield a good Crop, without missing\r\none Year.\r\n\r\n  [140] This Narrowness of the Intervals, if the Damage of it be\r\n  rightly computed, would amount to half the Inheritance of the Land;\r\n  and was occasioned by the Wilfulness of my Bailiff, who, drilling it\r\n  upon the Level, ordered the Horse to be guided half a Yard within\r\n  the Mark, because he fansied the Intervals would be too wide, if he\r\n  followed my Directions.\r\n\r\nIn another Field, there is now a Sixth Crop of Wheat, in wide\r\nIntervals, very promising, tho’ this Ground has had no sort of Dung to\r\nany of these Crops, or in several Years before them: The last Year’s\r\nCrop was the Fifth, and was the best of the Five, tho’ a Yard of the\r\nRow yielded but Eighteen Ounces and Three Quarters; and the Third Crop\r\nyielded Twenty Ounces Weight[141] of clean Wheat in the same Spot; but\r\n’twas because the Spot where the Twenty grew, was then a little higher\r\nthan the rest, which in Two Years became more equal; and the thin Land\r\nwas more deficient in that Third Crop, than the thick Land exceeded the\r\nthin in the Fifth Crop.\r\n\r\n  [141] Wheat, before Harvest, standing in Rows with wide Intervals\r\n  betwixt them, may not seem, to the Eye, to equal a Crop of half the\r\n  Bigness dispersed all over the Land, when sown in the common Manner;\r\n  and yet there is more Deceit in the Appearance of those different\r\n  Crops, whilst they are young, and in Grass: We should therefore not\r\n  judge of them then by our Imagination, but as we do of the Sun and\r\n  Moon nigh the Horizon, _viz._ by our Reason.\r\n\r\n  Imagination often deceives us by Arguments false or precarious;\r\n  but Reason leads us to Demonstration, by Weights and Measures: Yet\r\n  this Prejudice will vanish at Harvest before weighing; for then all\r\n  those wide Intervals that were bare, will be covered with large Ears\r\n  interfering to hide them quite, and make a finer Appearance than a\r\n  sown Crop. But ’tis observed, that the Cone-wheat makes the finest\r\n  Shew, when you look on it length ways of the Rows, both at Harvest,\r\n  and a considerable time before Harvest.\r\n\r\nIn the thick the Hoe-plough went deeper, and consequently raised more\r\nPasture there; but then it went the shallower in the thin; and when\r\nthe Land became of a more equal Depth the Fifth Year, the Plough and\r\nthe Hoe-plough went deeper, all the Piece being taken together; for\r\nthe Crop could be but in proportion to the different Pasture, allowing\r\nsomewhat for the more or less Seasonableness of the Year.\r\n\r\nThe Soil, in this our Case, cannot be supplied in Substance, but from\r\nthe Atmosphere. The Earth which the Rain brings can do it alone, if\r\nit fall in great Quantity; for by Water, ’tis plain, the Earth which\r\nnourished _Helmont_’s Tree was supplied; for the Tin-cover of the Box\r\nwherein it stood, prevented the Dews from entering.\r\n\r\nDews must add very much to the Land, thus continually tilled and hoed;\r\nfor they are more heavily charged with terrestrial Matter than Rain is,\r\nwhich appears from their forcing a Descent through the Air, when ’tis\r\nstrong enough to buoy up the Clouds from falling into Rain: And Dew,\r\nwhen kept in a Vessel long enough to putrefy, leaves a greater Quantity\r\nof black Matter at the Bottom of the Vessel, than Rain-water does in a\r\nVessel of the same Bigness, filled with it till putrefied.\r\n\r\nDews at Land, I suppose, are first exhaled from Rivers, and moist\r\nLands, and from the Expirations of Vegetables; most of the Dew which\r\nfalls on it is exhaled from untilled Land; but most of that which falls\r\non well tilled or well hoed Land, remains therein unexhaled; so that\r\nthe untilled Ground helps, by that means, to enrich and augment the\r\ntilled: For if an Acre be tilled for Two Years together without sowing,\r\nit will become richer by that Tillage, than by lying unplowed Four\r\nYears, which may be easily proved by Experience[142].\r\n\r\n  [142] _Non igitur Fatigatione, quemadmodum plurimi crediderunt_,\r\n  nec Senio, _sed nostra scilicet_ Inertia, _minus benigne nobis Arva\r\n  respondent._ Colum. _lib._ xi. _cap._ 1.\r\n\r\nBut then, as to Rain, the Sea being larger than all the Land (and its\r\nWaters, by their Motion, becoming replete with terrestrial Matter),\r\n’tis not unlikely, that more Vapour is raised from One Acre of Sea,\r\nthan from One hundred Acres of Land.\r\n\r\nSome have been so curious as to compute the Quantity of Rain, that\r\nfalls yearly in some Places in _England_, by a Contrivance of a Vessel\r\nto receive it; and ’tis found, in one of the driest Places, far from\r\nthe Sea, to be Fourteen Inches deep, in the Compass of a Year; in some\r\nPlaces much more; _viz._ at _Paris_, Nineteen Inches; in _Lancashire_,\r\nMr. _Townley_ found, by a long-continued Series of Observations, that\r\nthere falls above Forty Inches of Water in a Year’s time.\r\n\r\nCould we as easily compute the true Quantity of Earth in Rain-water, as\r\nthe Quantity of Water is computed, we might perhaps find it to answer\r\nthe Quantity of Earth taken off from our hoed Soil annually by the\r\nWheat.\r\n\r\nBut if Land sown with Wheat be not hoed, its Surface is soon\r\nincrustate; and then much of this Water, with its Contents, runs off,\r\nand returns to the Sea, without entering the Ground; and in Summer a\r\ngreat deal of what remains is exhaled by the Sun, and raised by the\r\nWind, both in Summer and Winter.\r\n\r\nSome there are who think it a fatal Objection, that the more an\r\nInterval is hoed, the more Weeds will grow in it; and that the Hoe can\r\nproduce, or (as they say) breed in it as many Weeds in one Summer, as\r\nwould have come thereon in Ten Years by the old Husbandry. But by this\r\nObjection they only maintain, that the Hoe can destroy as many Weeds in\r\nOne Summer, as the old Husbandry can in Ten Years.\r\n\r\nAnd they might add, that since all Weeds that grow where the Hoe comes,\r\nare killed before they seed, and that few of those Which grow in the\r\nold Husbandry, are killed[143] before their Seed be ripe and shed;\r\nthese Objectors will be forced to allow, that our Husbandry will lessen\r\na Stock of Weeds more in one Summer, than theirs can do to the World’s\r\nEnd; unless they believe the equivocal Generation of Weeds, than which\r\nOpinion nothing can be more absurd.\r\n\r\n  [143] Weeds cannot be killed before they grow, but will lie dormant,\r\n  as they do in our Partitions, and in their sown Land; and while\r\n  Seeds are in the Ground, they are always ready to grow at the first\r\n  Opportunity, and will certainly break out at one time or other; so\r\n  that preventing their coming, is only like healing up a Wound before\r\n  it be cured.\r\n\r\nSome object against my Method of[144] weighing a Yard, or a Perch in\r\nLength of a Row, saying, this does not determine the Produce of a whole\r\nField.\r\n\r\n  [144] I did not weigh this Yard, as different from the other Yards\r\n  round about it, for I had much Difficulty to determine which Row I\r\n  should chuse it in; when I was going to cut in one Row, it still\r\n  seemed that another was better, and I question whether I did chuse\r\n  the best at last.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, Whereas I often mention the Wheat of this Field to be without\r\n  Dung or Fallow, it must be understood of that Part of the Field\r\n  wherein my _Weighings_ and other Trials were made: because there was\r\n  a small Part once fallowed Eight or Nine Years ago, and a little\r\n  Dung laid on another Part about the last _Michaelmas_, after the\r\n  Crop of Oats was taken off. But this being a Year in which Dung is\r\n  observed to have little or no Effect on _sown_ Wheat (my Dung being\r\n  weak and laid thin), ’tis the same here; for those Rows which are in\r\n  the dunged Part, can hardly be distinguished from the rest of the\r\n  Rows which had not been dunged: And yet the Ends of the Rows which\r\n  were cleansed of Weeds, are very distinguishable by the Colour of\r\n  the Wheat, though some are the Third, and some the Fourth Crop since\r\n  the Difference was made; and the _whole_ Rows managed alike every\r\n  Year, from that time to this; so that _here_ Un-exhaustion is more\r\n  effectual than Dung. This is certain, that neither Dung nor Fallow\r\n  hath been near the Part wherein my Experiments were made.\r\n\r\nI answer, that they judge right, if the Produce of the whole Field be\r\nnot of equal Goodness; but if it be not, it must be because one Part\r\nof the Field is richer, or differently managed from the other Part:\r\nFor the same Causes that produce Twenty Ounces of clean Wheat upon one\r\nYard, must produce the same Quantity upon every Yard, of a Million of\r\nAcres.\r\n\r\nWhen the Crop of half a Field is spoiled by Sheep, not hoed at all, or\r\nimproperly, it would be ridiculous to compute the whole Field together\r\nfor an Experiment: We might indeed weigh the poorest, to prove the\r\nDifference of the one from the other, to try (as they sometimes seem to\r\ndo) how poor a Crop we can raise; but my Design was, to try how good a\r\nCrop I could raise with a Tenth Part of the common Expence.\r\n\r\nAnd I have often weighed the Produce of the same Quantity of\r\nGround[145], of all Sorts of sown Wheat, both the best and the worst;\r\nbut never have found any of the sown equal to the best of my drilled.\r\nIndeed we have none of the richest Land[146] in our Country within my\r\nReach, that being not above One Mile.\r\n\r\n  [145] I allow Two square Yards of their Crops to One Yard in Length\r\n  of my Treble Row.\r\n\r\n  [146] I am sorry that this Farm, whereon I have practised\r\n  Horse-hoeing, being situate on an Hill, that consists of Chalk on one\r\n  Side, and Heath ground on the other, has been usually noted for the\r\n  poorest and shallowest Soil in the Neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAs a Yard in Length of my treble Row of the Third successive Crop\r\nof Wheat, without Dung or Fallow, produced Twenty Ounces of Wheat;\r\nwhich, allowing Six Feet to the Ridge, is about Six Quarters[147] to\r\nan Acre; and, allowing Seven Inches to each Partition, and Two Inches\r\non each Outside, is in all Eighteen Inches of Ground to each treble\r\nRow, and but just One-fourth Part of the Ridge. Now, if, in the old\r\nHusbandry, the Crop was as good all over the Ground, as it was in\r\nthese Eighteen Inches of the treble Row, they must have Twenty-four\r\nQuarters to an Acre; but let them dung whilst they can, they will\r\nscarce raise Twenty-four Gallons of Wheat the Third Year, on an Acre of\r\nLand of equal Goodness; and let them leave out their Dung, and add no\r\nmore Tillage in lieu of it, and I believe they will not expect Three\r\nQuarters to an Acre, in all the Three Years put together.\r\n\r\n  [147] Eight Bushels make a Quarter.\r\n\r\nThe mean Price of Wheat, betwixt Dear and Cheap, is reckoned Five\r\nShillings a Bushel[148]; and therefore an Acre that would produce\r\nevery Year, without any Expence, Eight Bushels, would be thought an\r\nextraordinary profitable Acre; but yet a drilled Acre, that produces\r\nSixteen Bushels of Wheat, with the Expence of Ten or Fifteen\r\nShillings, is above a Third Part more profitable.\r\n\r\n  [148] ’Tis commonly said, that a Farmer cannot thrive, who for want\r\n  of Money is obliged to sell his Wheat under Five Shillings a Bushel;\r\n  but if he will sell it dear, he must keep it when ’tis cheap; And his\r\n  Way of keeping it is in the Straw, using his best Contrivances to\r\n  preserve it from the Mice.\r\n\r\n  The most secure Way of keeping a great Quantity of Wheat, that ever\r\n  I heard of, is by drying it. When I lived in _Oxfordshire_, one of\r\n  my nearest Neighbours was very expert in this, having practised it\r\n  for great Part of his Life: When Wheat was under Three Shillings a\r\n  Bushel, he bought in the Markets as much of the middle Sort of Wheat\r\n  as his Money would reach to purchase: He has often told me, that\r\n  his Method was to dry it upon an Hair-cloth, in a Malt-kiln, with\r\n  no other Fuel than clean Wheat-Straw; never suffering it to have\r\n  any stronger Heat than that of the Sun. The longest time he ever\r\n  let it remain in this Heat was Twelve Hours, and the shortest time\r\n  about Four Hours; the damper the Wheat was, and the longer intended\r\n  to be kept, the more Drying it requires: But how to distinguish\r\n  nicely the Degrees of Dampness, and the Number of Hours proper for\r\n  its Continuance upon the Kiln, he said was an Art impossible to be\r\n  learned by any other Means than by Practice. About Three or Four and\r\n  Twenty Years ago, Wheat being at Twelve Shillings a Bushel, he had\r\n  in his Granaries, as I was informed, Five thousand Quarters of dried\r\n  Wheat; none of which cost him above Three Shillings a Bushel.\r\n\r\n  This dried Wheat was esteemed by the _London_ Bakers to work better\r\n  than any new Wheat that the Markets afforded. His Speculation, which\r\n  put him upon this Project, was, that ’twas only the superfluous\r\n  Moisture of the Grain that caused its Corruption, and made it liable\r\n  to be eaten by the Wevil; and that when this Moisture was dried out,\r\n  it might be kept sweet and good for many Years; and that the Effect\r\n  of all Heat of the same Degree was the same, whether of the Straw, or\r\n  of the Sun.\r\n\r\n  As a Proof, he would shew, that every Grain of his Wheat would grow\r\n  after being kept Seven Years.\r\n\r\n  He was a most sincere honest Yeoman, who from a small Substance he\r\n  began with, left behind him about Forty thousand Pounds; the greatest\r\n  Part whereof was acquired by this Drying Method.\r\n\r\n  For the Hand-hoeing they use Hoes of Four Inches Breadth, very thin,\r\n  and well steeled: Their Thinness keeps them from wearing to a thick\r\n  Edge, and prevents the Necessity of often grinding them. Such Hoes\r\n  are in Use with some Gardeners near _London_. They need not be afraid\r\n  of drawing these little Hoes across the Rows of young Wheat to take\r\n  out the few Weeds that come therein at the early Hoeing; for whilst\r\n  the Wheat-plants are small, it may be an Advantage to cut out some of\r\n  the weakest, as they do of Turneps; for I perceive there are oftener\r\n  too many Plants than too few. But the thing that causes the greatest\r\n  Trouble in cleansing the Rows, is when the Seed is foul (_i. e._ full\r\n  of Seeds of Weeds): Therefore I cleanse my Seed-wheat by drawing it\r\n  on a Cloth on a Table, which makes it perfectly clean.\r\n\r\n  This Hand-hoeing should be performed about the End of _March_, or\r\n  Beginning of _April_, before the Wheat is spindled (_i. e._ run up\r\n  to Stalks); and if the Weather be dry enough, you may go lengthways\r\n  of the Ridges with a very light Roller to break the Clods of the\r\n  Partitions, whereby the Hoe will work the better.\r\n\r\n  If there should afterwards more Weeds come up, they must not be\r\n  suffered to ripen; and then the Soil will be every Year freer from\r\n  Weeds.\r\n\r\n  This Hand-hoeing of the Rows should be done at the proper time,\r\n  though it happen, by late Planting, that the Horse-hoe has not\r\n  gone before it; for it may be, that the Weather has kept out the\r\n  Horse-hoe: and the Earth may not be dry deep enough in the Intervals\r\n  for the Hoe-plough, but deep enough in the Partitions for the\r\n  Hand-hoe.\r\n\r\n  And the Expence of this Hand-work on the Rows would be well answered,\r\n  though there should not be one Weed in them; and so it would be, if a\r\n  second Hand hoeing were bestowed on the Partitions of every Crop of\r\n  Wheat not suspected of being too luxuriant.\r\n\r\n  If after the last Horse-hoeing there should be Occasion for another\r\n  Hoeing of the Intervals, where the Narrowness of them, and the\r\n  Leaning of tall Wheat, make it difficult or dangerous to be performed\r\n  by the Hoe-plough; a slight shallow Hoeing may be performed therein\r\n  by the Hand-hoe with Ease and Safety, at a very small Expence, which\r\n  would be more than doubly repaid in the following Crops.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  If any one doubts of the Efficacy of thus managing Wheat, it can’t\r\n  cost much to make proper Trials. But then Care must be taken, that\r\n  the Trials be proper. I do not advise any one to be at the Expence of\r\n  my Instruments for that Purpose, but to imitate them in pulverizing,\r\n  and all other directed Operations by the Spade and common Hoes. His\r\n  Ridges of Experiment need be no longer than Six Feet. Instead of a\r\n  Drill, make use of a triangular Piece of Wood, Seven Feet long, and\r\n  Four or Five Inches thick, with one Edge of which make Channels, and\r\n  place the Seed regularly even into them by Hand, and cover it with\r\n  the same Piece of Wood; but if the Earth be so wet, as to cling to\r\n  the Piece, then make use of it only as a Ruler, whereby to make the\r\n  Channels strait with a Stick.\r\n\r\n  Let some of the Ridges have double Rows, others treble; and let some\r\n  have treble Rows half-way, and leave out the middle Row in the other\r\n  Half, to shew whether the double Row or the treble Row produce a\r\n  better Crop.\r\n\r\n  Then for the First time of Hoeing, the Spade must work with its Back\r\n  towards the Row. The Second time, in turning the Earth to the Row,\r\n  the Spade’s Face must be towards it. These Two, and several other\r\n  Hoeings should be deep; but when the Roots are large (and the Hoeing\r\n  is near the Plants), the Spade must go shallow; and neither the Face\r\n  nor the Back of it must be towards the Row, except when the Earth is\r\n  turned towards it; and then the Face must be always towards it; but\r\n  for the rest of the last Hoeings, the Spade should work with its Face\r\n  towards one or other of the Ends of the Intervals, that the fewer of\r\n  the Roots may be cut off, and the more of them removed, and covered\r\n  again. Let the Spits be thin for the better pulverizing of the Mould.\r\n  The Hand-hoe will sometimes be useful in the Intervals, as well as in\r\n  the Partitions.\r\n\r\n  Four or Five Perches of Land may suffice for making proper Trials.\r\n\r\n  The Expence of this will be little, though perhaps Ten times more\r\n  than that which is done by the proper Instruments for the same\r\n  Proportion of Land.\r\n\r\n  But I must give this Caution, that no Part of it be done out of the\r\n  Reach of the Master’s Eye; for if it should, he may expect to be\r\n  disappointed.\r\n\r\n  The richer the Land, the thinner it must be planted to prevent the\r\n  lodging of Corn.\r\n\r\n  The Master ought to compute the Quantity of Seed, due to each Perch,\r\n  at the Rate of Five or Six Gallons to an Acre, by Weighing, _&c._ as\r\n  I have shewn in my Essay.\r\n\r\n  I cannot commend more than Two Partitions in a Row, or more than One,\r\n  when the Intervals are narrow; because the broader the Row is, the\r\n  more Earth will remain unpulverized, under the Partitions; too much\r\n  of which Earth being whole, will disappoint, at least, one of the\r\n  Differences mentioned in my xviith Chapter.\r\n\r\n  Indifferent Land I think most proper whereon to make the Experiment,\r\n  and the most improper for Corn is barren Land, as the best brings the\r\n  largest Crops.\r\n\r\n  To ascertain the Quantity of the Crop, take a Yard in the Middle of a\r\n  Ridge, and weigh its Produce.\r\n\r\n  Every Year leave one Interval unhoed, to prove the Difference of that\r\n  Side of a double or treble Row next to it, from the other Side next\r\n  to the hoed Interval.\r\n\r\n  But it must be _noted_, that the Spade doth not always pulverize so\r\n  much as the Plough, or Hoe-plough; therefore there may be occasion\r\n  for more Diggings than there would be of Horse-hoeings.\r\n\r\n  One of the Observations that put me upon Trials of wide Intervals,\r\n  and Horse work for Corn, was the following; _viz._ One Half of a\r\n  poorish Field was sown with Barley; the other Half drilled with\r\n  Turneps, the Rows Thirty Inches asunder, at the proper Season, and\r\n  twice hoed with a Sort of Horse-hoe contrived for that Purpose (but\r\n  nothing like that I have described); the Drill, beginning next to\r\n  the Barley, left an Interval of the same (30 Inches) Breadth between\r\n  the First Row of Turneps and the Barley, which, being sown on large\r\n  Furrows, came up in a sort of Rows, as is common for Barley to come\r\n  when sown on such wide Furrows. This Interval between the Barley and\r\n  the Turneps had the same Hoeings as the rest, and had this Effect\r\n  on the broad Row of Barley next to it; _viz._ Each Plant had many\r\n  Stalks; it was of a very deep flourishing Colour, grew high, the Ears\r\n  very long, and, in all respects, the Barley was as good as if it had\r\n  been produced by the richest Land. The next Row of Barley had some\r\n  little Benefit on the Side next to the strong Row; but all the rest\r\n  of the Barley, either by the too late Sowing of it, the Poverty of\r\n  the Soil (not being in any manner dunged), or else by the Coldness\r\n  of the Land, or Coldness of the Summer, or by all of these Causes,\r\n  though pretty free from Weeds, was exceeding poor, yellow, low, thin,\r\n  and the Ears were very short and small.\r\n\r\n  I intended to have taken the exact Difference there was between the\r\n  Produce of this outside Row, and one of those that stood out of the\r\n  Reach of the hoed Interval: But I was disappointed by my Neighbour’s\r\n  Herd of Cows, that in the Night broke in just before Harvest, and eat\r\n  off almost all the Ears of the rich Row, doing very little Damage\r\n  to the rest, except by treading it. It must be from the different\r\n  Tastes, the one being sweet, and the other bitter, that they make\r\n  their Election to eat the one, and refuse the other.\r\n\r\n  This accidental Observation was sufficient to demonstrate the\r\n  Efficacy of deep Hoeing, which I look upon as synonymous to\r\n  Horse-hoeing.\r\n\r\n  I immediately set about contriving my limbered Hoe, finding all\r\n  other Sorts insufficient for the Exactness required in this hoeing\r\n  Operation: Those drawn in any other manner, when they went too far\r\n  from the Row, and the Holder went to lift the Plough nearer, it would\r\n  fly back again, like the Sally of a Bell, and go at no Certainty not\r\n  being subject to the Guidance of the Holder, as the limber Hoe-plough\r\n  is. The _Michaelmas_ following I began my present Horse-hoeing\r\n  Scheme; which has never yet deceived my Expectations, when performed\r\n  according to the Directions I have given my Readers. And the Practice\r\n  of this Scheme proves the Advantage of deep Hoeing, by the Ends of\r\n  the Ridges and Intervals; for there, whilst the drawing Cattle go\r\n  on the Headland that is higher, the Furrows are shallower, and the\r\n  Corn of the Rows is always there visibly poorer in proportion to that\r\n  Shallowness.\r\n\r\n  Another Proof of the Difference there is between deep Hoeing and\r\n  shallow, is in the Garden, where a square Perch of Cabbages, the Rows\r\n  of which are Three Feet asunder; the middle Row of them having the\r\n  Intervals on each Side of it deeply and well dug by the Spade at the\r\n  same proper time, when the rest of the Intervals are Hand hoed; this\r\n  middle Row will shew the Difference of those Two Operations: But in\r\n  this must be observed what I have here before mentioned, of turning\r\n  the Back of the Spade to the Plants, to avoid the total removing\r\n  them, especially in very dry Weather.\r\n\r\n  This Experiment hath been tried, and always succeeds with every one\r\n  that has made the Trials.\r\n\r\n  But before any one makes his Trials of my Field-scheme, I would\r\n  advise him to be Master of the Treatise, by making an _Index_ himself\r\n  to it: This will both direct him in his Proceedings, and shew him the\r\n  Rashness of those, who go into the Practice of my Husbandry, without\r\n  the necessary Preparation; for they that do so now, seem to act as\r\n  rashly, as they that went into it before the Treatise was published.\r\n  ’Tis reasonable to presume, that such their Practice must be either\r\n  different from, or contrary to mine.\r\n\r\n  This _Index_ may be also useful for discovering Pretenders by an\r\n  Examination, without which, Gentlemen are liable to be imposed on by\r\n  them, as I am afraid too many have been; for amongst all those who\r\n  have undertaken the Management of my Scheme for Noblemen, or others,\r\n  I declare I do not know one Person that sufficiently understands\r\n  it: There may be some who have seen, or perhaps performed, some of\r\n  the mechanical Part; but I don’t think it can be properly performed\r\n  without a thorough Knowlege of the Principles, which cannot be\r\n  expected of such illiterate Persons; and yet is necessary for the\r\n  proper Applications in different Cases, which cannot be distinguished\r\n  by Pretenders: Therefore, until the Scheme becomes common, the\r\n  Management must be under the Direction of the Master himself, or of\r\n  one who has past his Examination, and is faithful.\r\n\r\n  To the above Trials, I here add the following, together with some\r\n  Alterations of the former.\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen who can get the _Smyrna_ Wheat, I advise to make Trials of\r\n  it in single Rows, of between 17 and 18 to an Acre, in this Method;\r\n  there being no Partitions, the Intervals will be of the same Width as\r\n  in the Ridges of 14 to an Acre, that have Partitions of Ten Inches.\r\n  Thus almost all the Earth of the Ridges may be pulverized by the\r\n  Hoe-plough in the Field, or by the Spade in this Trial; and very\r\n  little Hand-work will be necessary for cleansing out the Weeds that\r\n  come in the Rows, and on each side of them. The Land will be the\r\n  fitter for a succeeding Crop of Wheat with less Harrowing. But this\r\n  must be observed, that, in regard to hard Frosts in Winter, and very\r\n  dry Weather in Summer, the alternate Hoeing described in the Chapter\r\n  of Turneps may be proper; lest the little Earth that may be left for\r\n  the Row to stand on, when the Furrows are turned from both Sides of\r\n  it, should not be sufficient to secure the Roots from the Injuries\r\n  that may happen to them by being exposed either to Frost or Drought\r\n  on both Sides of the Row at the same time.\r\n\r\n  In the Field, when the Ridges are all of an equal Breadth, the best\r\n  Way is to plant Two of the single Rows at once, by setting the Two\r\n  Beams of the Drill at the same Distance asunder, as each of the\r\n  Ridges is broad; and the Beast that draws it must go in the Middle of\r\n  the Interval, planting a Row on each Side of it; but if the Ridges\r\n  are very unequal, the Beast (a little Horse is best) that draws the\r\n  Drill must go on the Top of a Ridge, planting one Row thereon; and\r\n  the Drill for this Purpose is the same as the Turnep-drill, except\r\n  that the Beam-share, Seed-box, and Spindle, are the same as those of\r\n  the Wheat-drill; and ’tis but to take off from the Wheat-drill one of\r\n  its Beams, and place it in the room of the Beam of the Turnep-drill,\r\n  and placing the Cross-piece of the Turnep-beam (see Plate 5.)\r\n  on this Beam, and also a short Wheat-hopper to be drawn by the\r\n  Turnep-standards, setting the Wheels near enough together; _i. e._ as\r\n  near as the Wheels of the Wheat-drill are, I mean those which plant\r\n  Two Rows.\r\n\r\n  Two Gallons of _Smyrna_ Wheat I judge will be Seed sufficient for an\r\n  Acre, especially if planted early.\r\n\r\n  Planting one Row upon a Ridge, I think is the most advantageous\r\n  Method of all; but, not being able to get any _Smyrna_ Wheat (tho’ I\r\n  have been often promised it), I have made no Trial of it; and I do\r\n  not believe the Plants of any other Sort of Wheat are large enough\r\n  for such single Rows.\r\n\r\n  I am not quite a Stranger to this Wheat; for I have seen the Product\r\n  of it, both in the Garden, and in the Field, above Forty Years ago.\r\n\r\n  I am now making Trials, in order to know how much a single Row of\r\n  White cone Wheat will exceed half a double one: For this Purpose, I\r\n  cause one Row of the double, with the Partition, to be dug out with a\r\n  Spade, in Part of every Field, Two or Three Yards in a Place: These I\r\n  intend shall be hoed as the double Rows are; and where the Hoe-plough\r\n  doth not reach, the Spade shall supply its Use.\r\n\r\n  I do not expect this single Row will equal the double Row; but I am\r\n  in no doubt but that it will produce more Grain than half a double\r\n  Row.\r\n\r\n  I cannot tell whether the Sort of Cone-wheat that sends out little\r\n  Branches on each Side of the Ear, might not succeed tolerably well in\r\n  single Rows; for its Ear is, when well nourished, larger than the Ear\r\n  of the White-cone; tho’ not near so large as that of the _Smyrna_.\r\n\r\n  Another Experiment I propose to be made as a Trial for the\r\n  Satisfaction of such sceptical Gentlemen who may doubt the Truth of\r\n  what I have related in p. 27, 28. concerning the wonderful Effect of\r\n  deep Hoeing. In a Field of very poor old decayed St. Foin, let Two\r\n  or Three Perches be hedged in, in a square Piece, and Two, Three, or\r\n  more Intervals, of Three or Four Feet wide each, be well pulverized\r\n  by the Spade, leaving between every Two of them, Two or Three Feet\r\n  of the St. Foin unmoved. Begin this Work in Summer, and repeat the\r\n  Hoeing pretty often, observing the Rules I have laid down for Hoeing\r\n  the Intervals of Wheat. Let not the Back of the Spade be turned\r\n  towards the unmoved St. Foin, from which it throws the Earth at the\r\n  First time of Hoeing; which is contrary to the First Hoeing of Wheat\r\n  with a Spade; because there would otherwise be Danger of moving\r\n  Wheat-roots; but there is no Danger of moving the St. Foin Roots,\r\n  unless you wholly dig them out: Therefore the best Way for this\r\n  Hoeing is to dig with the Back of the Spade towards one or the other\r\n  End of the Interval: This cuts off the fewest Roots, and covers the\r\n  most of them, and may perhaps be sometimes best for Wheat also. When\r\n  the Earth is turned towards the St. Foin Rows, the Spade’s Face will\r\n  be towards them of course.\r\n\r\n  Be sure to leave Four or more Feet untouched next to the Hedge that\r\n  bounds the Piece, to the End that the Increase of the hoed St. Foin\r\n  may the more plainly appear by comparing its Plants with those that\r\n  are not hoed.\r\n\r\n  If the Plants are very thick, make them thinner on one side of an\r\n  Interval; and, on the other side, let them remain thick. You will\r\n  certainly find the thin Plants most wonderfully increased in a Year\r\n  or two, and the thick ones in proportion; and also the natural Grass,\r\n  and all other Vegetables that grow near to the Intervals when they\r\n  are well pulverized. I am confident mine, thus managed by Ploughs,\r\n  increased some to an Hundred, some to a Thousand times the Size they\r\n  were of before that Pulveration.\r\n\r\n  All the Methods I have here and elsewhere described for the Field, I\r\n  advise to be tried in these few Perches for Experiments.\r\n\r\n  I think some of those Ridges whereon one End is to be managed\r\n  differently from the other End, should be longer than Six Feet; else\r\n  the Roots of the Wheat and Weeds may so mix, and draw Nourishment\r\n  from one another in the Middle of the Ridge, that the Difference\r\n  of the Managements may not so plainly be seen as when the Ridge is\r\n  longer.\r\n\r\n  The few Perches of Land whereon any of the proposed Experiments are\r\n  to be made, should be bounded in with dead Hedges; and should not be\r\n  situate within Three or Four Poles of a live Hedge or Tree.\r\n\r\n  The Three Instruments to be used in these unexpensive Trials, are,\r\n  the Spade, to supply the Use of the Plough and Hoe plough; the\r\n  Hand-hoe; and a Rake, instead of Harrows.\r\n\r\nI don’t know that I ever had an Acre yet, that was tolerably well\r\nmanaged in this Manner, but what produced much more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_Of_ SMUTTINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmuttiness is when the Grains of Wheat instead of Flour, are full of\r\na black, stinking Powder: ’Tis a Disease of Wheat, which I don’t know\r\nis usual any-where but in cold Northern Countries; for if it had been\r\ncommon in _Greece_ or _Italy_, there would probably have been some\r\nWord to express it by, in those Languages, as well as there is for the\r\nBlight.\r\n\r\nI take it to be caused by cold wet Summers; and I was confirmed in this\r\nby several Plants of Wheat, taken up when they were in Grass in the\r\nSpring, and placed in Troughs in my Chamber-window, with some of the\r\nRoots in Water. These Wheat-plants sent up several Ears each; but at\r\nHarvest, every Grain was smutty; and I observed, none of the Ears ever\r\nsent out any Blossom: This Smuttiness could not be from any Moisture\r\nthat descended upon it, but from the Earth, which always kept very\r\nmoist, as in the aforesaid Mint Experiment. The Wheat-plants in the\r\nField, from whence these were taken, brought very few smutty Grains,\r\nbut brought much larger Ears than these.\r\n\r\nWhatsoever the Cause[149] be, there are but Two Remedies proposed; and\r\nthose are Brining, and Change of Seed.\r\n\r\n  [149] The largest grained, plump, fat Wheat, is more liable to\r\n  Smuttiness, than small-grained thin Wheat.\r\n\r\nBrining of Wheat, to cure or prevent Smuttiness (as I have been\r\ncredibly informed), was accidentally discovered about Seventy Years\r\nago, in the following Manner; _viz._ A Ship-load of Wheat was sunk near\r\n_Bristol_ in Autumn, and afterwards at Ebbs all taken up, after it had\r\nbeen soaked in Sea-water; but it being unfit for making of Bread, a\r\nFarmer sowed some of it in a Field; and when it was found to grow very\r\nwell, the whole Cargo was bought at a low Price by many Farmers, and\r\nall of it sown in different Places. At the following Harvest, all the\r\nWheat in _England_ happened to be smutty, except the Produce of this\r\nbrined Seed, and that was all clean from Smuttiness. This Accident has\r\nbeen sufficient to justify the Practice of Brining ever since in all\r\nthe adjacent Parts, and in most Places in _England_.\r\n\r\nI knew Two Farmers, whose Farms lay intermixed; they bought the same\r\nSeed together, from a very good Change of Land, and parted every Load\r\nbetwixt them in the Field. The oldest Farmer believed Brining to be but\r\na Fancy, and sowed his Seed unbrined; the other brined all his Part of\r\nSeed, and had not a smutty Ear in his Crop; but the old Farmer’s Crop\r\nwas very smutty.\r\n\r\nWheat for Drilling must have no other Brine, than what is made of pure\r\nSalt; for if there be any Brine of Meat amongst it[150], the Grease\r\nwill not suffer the Wheat to be dry enough to be drilled.\r\n\r\n  [150] Urine also makes the Wheat so greasy, that it will not be dry\r\n  time enough to be drilled.\r\n\r\nIf Seed-wheat be soaked in Urine, it will not grow; or if only\r\nsprinkled with it, it will most of it die, unless planted presently.\r\n\r\nThe most expeditious Way of brining Wheat for the Drill, is to make\r\na very strong Brine; and when the Wheat is laid on an Heap, sprinkle\r\nor lave it therewith; then turn it with a Shovel, and lave on more\r\nBrine; turn it again with a Shovel, until, by many Repetitions of\r\nthis, the Wheat be all equally wet. Next, sift on Quick-lime through\r\na Sieve; turn the Wheat with a Shovel, and sift on more Lime; repeat\r\nthis Sifting and Turning many times, which will make it dry enough to\r\nbe drilled immediately; and this has been found sufficient to preserve\r\nuninfected Wheat from the Smut in a bad Year, the Seed being changed.\r\n\r\nTo dry it, we use[151] Quick-lime (that is, unslacked), which, beaten\r\nto Powder, and sifted thereon, confines the Brine to the Surfaces of\r\nthe Grains, and suffers none of it to be exhaled by the Air: But when\r\nLime has been long slacked, and is grown weak, ’tis unfit for this\r\nPurpose.\r\n\r\n  [151] But if this doth not afford Powder enough, the Pieces must be\r\n  slacked immediately before using; for if the Lime lie long after it\r\n  is slacked (especially that made of Chalk), it will become weak, and\r\n  lose most of its drying Quality.\r\n\r\n  Some Farmers use only to boil the strongest Quick-lime in Water, with\r\n  which, instead of Brine, they sprinkle their Wheat, affirming it to\r\n  be as effectual as that for preventing the Smut: But this not being\r\n  within the Compass of my own Experience, I am doubtful of it; yet I\r\n  wish it may be found effectual, because it would save Trouble to the\r\n  Sower, and more to the Driller.\r\n\r\nSmutty Seed-wheat, tho’ brined, will produce a smutty Crop, unless the\r\nYear prove very favourable.\r\n\r\nFor ’tis to be known, that favourable Years will cure the Smut, as\r\nunkind ones will cause it: Else, before Brining was used, and the bad\r\nYears had caused all the Wheat in _England_ to be smutty, they must\r\nhave brought their Seed from Foreign Countries, or never have had any\r\nclean Wheat: Therefore ’tis certain, that kind Years will cure the\r\nSmut: ’Tis therefore to prevent the Injury of a bad Year, that we plant\r\nclean Seed, and well brined.\r\n\r\nBut of the Two Remedies against Smuttiness, a proper Change of Seed\r\nsome think the most certain.\r\n\r\nA very worthy Gentleman assures me, that since he has found out a Place\r\nthat affords a Change of Seed proper to his Land, which is for these\r\nTen Years past, he never had a Smutty Ear in any of his Crops (and he\r\nnever brines nor limes it), tho’ all other Wheat have been often smutty\r\nthroughout his Neighbourhood every wet Year, tho’ brined and limed. He\r\nsays, the Person who furnishes him with this Seed, is very curious in\r\nchanging his Seed also every Year.\r\n\r\nThis gives a Suspicion, that our drowned Wheat at _Bristol_ might\r\npossibly be Foreign; and then might not have been smutty the next Year,\r\ntho’ it had not been soaked in the Sea-water.\r\n\r\nThe Wheat sown by the Two Farmers aforementioned might be from a good\r\nChange of Land, but the Seed not changed the precedent Year; and then\r\nit might be no more infected, than what the Brine and Lime did cure.\r\n\r\nTo know what Changes are best to prevent Smuttiness of Wheat, we must\r\nconsult the most Experienced; and they tell us, that the strong Clay\r\nLand is best to be sent to for Seed-wheat, whatever Sort of Land it be\r\nto be sowed upon; a White-clay is a good Change for a Red-clay, and a\r\nRed for a White. That from any strong Land is better than from a light\r\nLand; and the old Rhyme is, that Sand is a Change for no Land. But from\r\nwhatever Land the Seed be taken, if it was not changed the preceding\r\nYear, it may possibly be infected; and then there may be Danger, tho’\r\nwe have it immediately from never so proper a Soil.\r\n\r\nThe strongest Objection that has been yet made against constant annual\r\nCrops of Wheat, is, that those Grains of the precedent Crop which\r\nhappen to shed, and grow in the following Crop, will be in Danger of\r\nSmuttiness, for want of changing those individual Seeds.\r\n\r\nAll I can say in Answer is, that during these Five Years, which is all\r\nthe time I have had these annual Crops, this objected Inconvenience\r\nnever has happened to me, even when a precedent Crop has been smutty.\r\n\r\nThe Reason I take to be, that a Crop very early planted is not so apt\r\nto be smutty; and if it be not planted early, the Grains that are shed\r\ngrow, and are killed before, or at the time of planting the next Crop.\r\nThis saves a Crop following a smutty one (which is always occasioned by\r\nbad Seed, or bad Ordering); and when the former Crop was planted with\r\ngood Seed well ordered, the shattered Grains of that may produce clean\r\nWheat the Second Year; and ’tis very unlikely, that any Breed of these\r\nGrains should remain to grow in the Crop the Third Year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_Of_ BLIGHT.\r\n\r\nWheat is blighted at Two Seasons; First, when in the Blossom; and then\r\nits Generation is prevented and many of the Husks are empty in the Ear,\r\nthe Grains not being impregnated.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Wheat is blighted, when the Grains are brought to the time of\r\ntheir Maturity, but are light, and of little Value for making of Bread;\r\nbecause they are not well filled with Flour.\r\n\r\nThe First cannot happen in _England_ by the Frost because the Winters\r\ndo not suffer it to grow so much, as to come into Blossom before the\r\nMonth of _June_; but they are long continual Rains that rot or chill\r\nthe Blossoms, and prevent their Fertility. Yet this is what seldom\r\nhappens to any great Degree. Wheat that grows in open Fields has some\r\nAdvantage from the Wind, that dislodges the Water sooner from the\r\nEars, than it can do in sheltry Places; and Lammas Wheat does not\r\nhold the Drops of Rain so long as the Bearded (or Cone) Wheat, which\r\nreceived very great Damage by this sort of Blight in the Year 1725, the\r\nlike never having been heard of before.\r\n\r\nThe Second sort of Blight, _viz._ from light Ears, is that which is\r\nmost frequent, and more general: This brings the greatest Scarcity of\r\nWheat. The Cause is plainly Want of Nourishment to perfect the Grain,\r\nby whatever means that Want is occasioned.\r\n\r\nSeveral Accidents kill the Plants, or injure their Health, and then\r\nthe Grains are not filled; as Lightning, the Effects whereof may\r\nbe observed by the blackish Spots and Patches in Fields of Wheat,\r\nespecially in such Years as have more of it than usual. Against this\r\nthere is no Defence.\r\n\r\nThe other Causes of the Blight, which are most general, and do the most\r\nDamage, may, in some measure, be prevented.\r\n\r\nOne Cause is the lodging or falling of Corn; for then the Stalks are\r\nbroken near the Ground, whereby many of the Vessels are so pressed,\r\nthat the Juices cannot pass them; and then the free Circulation is\r\nhindered; the Chyle cannot mount in sufficient Quantity to be purified,\r\nand turned into Sap; the Defect whereof makes the Plants become\r\nlanguid, and only just able to live; they have Strength enough to\r\nlinger on to the time of their Period, as in very old Age, but not to\r\nbring their Fruit, which is the Grain, to its natural Bulk, nor to fill\r\nit with Flour: and the sooner the Stalks fall, the less and thinner the\r\nGrain will be.\r\n\r\nHence it often happens, that when Tillage, Dung, and good Land have\r\nbrought a Crop of Wheat, that in the Months of _April_ and _May_\r\npromise to yield the Owner Five or Six Quarters on an Acre, then in\r\n_June_ it falls down, and scarce affords Five or Six Bushels; and that\r\nperhaps is so thin and lank, that the Expence of reaping and threshing\r\nit may overbalance its Value.\r\n\r\nThat the falling down of Wheat does cause the Ruin of the Crop, is well\r\nknown; but what causes it to fall, is not so plain.\r\n\r\nAnd, without knowing the true Causes, ’tis not likely that a Remedy\r\nshould be found against the Disease.\r\n\r\nI take this Weakness of the Stalks, which occasions their falling, to\r\nproceed from want of Nourishment, want of Air, want of the Sun’s Rays,\r\nor of all Three.\r\n\r\nOne Argument, that it lodges for want of Nourishment, is, that a rich\r\nAcre has maintain’d a Crop of Five Quarters standing, when another\r\npoorer Acre was not able to support a Crop from falling, which was but\r\nlarge enough to have brought Three Quarters, if it had stood: and this\r\nin the same Year, and on the same Situation. And ’tis very plain, that\r\nif one Acre was twice as rich as the other, it must be able to nourish\r\nFive Quarters better than the other could nourish Three Quarters.\r\n\r\nAir is necessary to the Life and Health of all Plants, tho’ in very\r\ndifferent Degrees: Aquatics, which live under Water, are content with\r\nas little Air, as their Companions the Fishes.\r\n\r\nBut Wheat, being a terrestrial Plant, (tho’ in Winter it will live many\r\nDays under Water, whilst the slow Motion of its Sap gives it little\r\nor no Increase), requires a free open Air, and does not succeed so\r\nwell in low sheltery Places, as upon higher and opener Situations;\r\nwhere the Air has a greater Motion, and can more easily carry off the\r\nRecrements from the Leaves, after it has shaken off the Dews and Rains,\r\nwhich would otherwise suffocate the Plants; and therefore the Leaves\r\nare made so susceptible of Motion from the Air, which frees them from\r\nthe Dews, that would stop in the Recrements at the _Vesiculæ_ of the\r\nLeaves, but shaken down will nourish the Plants at the Roots: The want\r\nof this Motion weakening the Wheat, ’tis (as Animals in the like sickly\r\nCase are) the more unable to stand, and the more liable to be press’d\r\ndown by the Weight of Rain-water, and more unable to rise up again when\r\ndown: All which Evils are remov’d by the free Motion of the Air, which\r\nshakes off both Dews and Rains, and thus contributes to prevent the\r\nfalling (or lodging) of Wheat.\r\n\r\nA great Quantity also of the Sun’s Rays is necessary to keep Wheat\r\nstrong, and in Health; and in _Egypt_, and other hot Countries, it is\r\nnot so apt to fall, as it is when sown in Northern Climates, tho’ the\r\nProduce of the South be the greatest[152].\r\n\r\n  [152] This proves that the Crop doth not lodge on account of its\r\n  Bigness.\r\n\r\nIt may be observ’d, that every Leaf is inserted into a Sort of Knot,\r\nwhich probably delivers the Sap to be depurated at the _Vesiculæ_ of\r\nthe Leaves, and then receives it back again for the Nourishment of\r\nthe Plant, doing for that Purpose the Office of an Heart: But the Sun\r\nwith his Rays supplies the Part of Pulse, to keep the Sap in Motion,\r\nand carry on its Circulation, instead of the Heart’s _Systole_ and\r\n_Diastole_. Wheat, being doubtless originally a Native of a hot\r\nCountry, requires by its Constitution a considerable Degree of Heat\r\nto bring it to Perfection; and if much of that Degree be wanting, the\r\nWheat will be the weaker; and when the Solar Rays cannot reach the\r\nlower Parts of the Stalks, the lowest Leaves and Knots cannot do their\r\nOffice; for which Reason the Chyle must mount higher before it be made\r\ninto Sap, and there must be then a greater Mixture of crude Chyle next\r\nto the Ground, as by the white Colour it appears[153]. By this Means\r\nthat Part, which, if it had a due Share of the Sun’s Influence, would\r\nbe harden’d like a Bone or Spring, for the Support of the Stalks, for\r\nlack of that, becomes more like to a Cartilage, soft and weak, unable\r\nto sustain the Weight of the bending Ear, which, having its greatest\r\n_Impetus_ against this Part, which is most feeble to resist it, it\r\nyields, and lets it fall to the Ground; and then the Grain will be\r\nblighted.\r\n\r\n  [153] But now I suspect this to be a Mistake, it being more likely,\r\n  that the white Colour of the Rind is owing to the Absence of the Sun\r\n  and free Air, than to the Chyle, as the Skin of those Parts of our\r\n  own Bodies that are concealed from them, is whiter than of those\r\n  which are exposed to them, though no Chyle-vessel comes near our Skin.\r\n\r\nThere is also another Cause of the Blight; and that is, the Wheat’s\r\ncoming too late into Blossom. The usual Time is the Beginning of\r\n_June_; and if it be later, the Days shorten so fast after the\r\nSolstice, that the Autumn of the Year hastening the Autumn of the\r\nWheat’s Life, the full Time of its Pregnancy[154] is not accomplish’d;\r\nand then its Fruit, which is the Grain, becomes as it were abortive,\r\nand not full-grown. This Time betwixt the Generation, Blossoming, and\r\nthe Maturity of the Grain, is, or ought to be, about Two Months.\r\n\r\n  [154] _Ut enim Mulieres habent ad Partum Dies certos, sic Arbores ac\r\n  Fruges._ Varro, _Lib._ 1. _Cap._ 44.\r\n\r\n  _Mense Maio florent; sic Frumenta, & Ordeum, & quæ sunt Seminis\r\n  singularis, Octo diebus florebunt, & deinde per Dies_ 40.\r\n  _grandescunt Flore deposito usque ad Maturitatis Eventum._ Palladius,\r\n  _Pag._ 114, 115.\r\n\r\n  _Quindecim Diebus esse in Vaginis, Quindecim florere, Quindecim\r\n  exarescere, cum sit maturum Frumentum._ Varro, _Lib._ 1. _Cap._ 32.\r\n\r\n  But the different Heat that there is in different Climates, may alter\r\n  both the Time that Plants continue in Blossom, and the Time betwixt\r\n  the Blossoming and the Ripening.\r\n\r\nTherefore ’tis advantageous to hasten, what we can, the Time of\r\nBlossoming, and to protract the Time of Ripening: And ’tis observ’d,\r\nthat the earliest sown Wheat generally escapes the Blight the best,\r\nbecause it comes first into Blossom.\r\n\r\nFeeding down the Wheat with Sheep prevents the Blight, by doing what\r\nthe Blight wou’d do, if the Wheat fell down, _i. e._ causes the Ears to\r\nbe light[155].\r\n\r\n  [155] Heavy Ears never fall. If they did, that would not make them\r\n  light. Wheat falls sometimes whilst ’tis in Grass, and before it\r\n  comes into Ear; so far are the Ears from causing it to fall. This was\r\n  proved by my whole Crop the last Harvest, and particularly by the\r\n  _Measured Acre_, the Ears of which, tho’ prodigious large and heavy,\r\n  were none of them lodg’d, when those of sown Wheat on the other Side\r\n  of the Hedge were fallen down flat, and lodg’d on the Ground.\r\n\r\nAnd we find, that those who practise this Method of feeding their Wheat\r\nwith Sheep in the Spring, to prevent the lodging of it, have most\r\ncommonly their Straw weak, and Ears light.\r\n\r\nThese, instead of making the Stalks strong enough to support heavy\r\nEars, make the Ears light enough to be supported by weak Stalks. They\r\nknow that heavy Ears make the greatest Crop; and yet they still hope to\r\nhave it from light ones.\r\n\r\nThey _cause_ the _Blight_ by the very means they make use of to _cure_\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis feeding of Wheat much retards the Time of its blossoming; and that\r\nit may blossom early, is one chief End of sowing it early, to prevent\r\nthe Blight. But when it is fed, what the Plants send up next is but\r\na Sort of second or latter Crop, which has longer to stand than the\r\nfirst would have required, and is always weaker than the first Crop\r\nwould have been; and the longer time it has to continue on the Ground,\r\nthe more Nourishment is required to maintain it; and yet, as has been\r\nshewn, the longer it has been sown, the more the Earth has lost of its\r\nNourishment; and consequently, the Crop will be yet weaker, and in\r\nmore Danger of the starving Blight[156].\r\n\r\n  [156] I am sure, that whenever Sheep break into my drill’d Wheat\r\n  in the Spring, it lessens my Crop half, just as far as they eat\r\n  the Rows. There are several Reasons why Sheep are more injurious\r\n  to drilled Wheat than sown; I would not therefore be understood to\r\n  decry the Practice of seeding sown Wheat, when the Thickness and\r\n  Irregularity of its Plants make it necessary: I have only endeavoured\r\n  to shew, that that Practice is founded upon a false Theory. For, if\r\n  Wheat fell down by reason of the Luxuriance of it; a Plant of it\r\n  would be more likely to fall when single, and at a great Distance\r\n  from every other Plant, than when near to other Plants, because such\r\n  a single Plant is (_cæteris paribus_) always the most luxuriant; and\r\n  I have not seen such a one fall (except Birds pull down the Ears),\r\n  but have observed the contrary, though its Ears are the largest.\r\n\r\n  The Subject I write on is Drilling and Hoeing, and of whatsoever else\r\n  I think relates to the Practice or Theory thereof; which obliges me\r\n  to advise against Drilling too thick upon any Sort of Land; but more\r\n  especially upon very rich Land: For though I have no such Land, yet\r\n  I apprehend, that a too great Number of Plants may overstock the\r\n  Rows, and cause them to be liable to some of the Inconveniences of\r\n  sown Wheat; and in such a Case, perhaps, Sheep may be rather useful\r\n  than prejudicial to the drilled Wheat; but of this I have had no\r\n  Experience: And if it should be too thick, it will be owing to the\r\n  Fault of the Manager or Driller; but, I suppose, it might be a better\r\n  Remedy to cut out the superfluous Plants by the Hand-hoe, in the\r\n  manner that superfluous Turneps are hoed out.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual Remedy against the Blight is that which removes all\r\nits Causes (except such extraordinary ones as Lightning); as,\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, _Want of Nourishment_.\r\n\r\nThe Horse-hoe will, in wide Intervals, give Wheat, throughout all the\r\nStages of its Life, as much Nourishment as the discreet Hoer pleases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly, _Want of Air_.\r\n\r\nAir, being a Fluid, moves most freely in a right or strait Line; for\r\nthere the fewest of its Parts meet with any Resistance; as a strait\r\nRiver runs swifter than a crooked one, from an equal Declivity; because\r\nmore of the Water strikes against the Banks at the Turnings, and is\r\nthere somewhat retarded: and the rest moving no faster than in the\r\nstrait River, the whole Stream of the crooked must be slower in its\r\nCourse, than that of the strait River.\r\n\r\nThe Air cannot pass thro’ sown Corn in a direct Line, because it must\r\nstrike against, and go round every Plant, they standing all in the Way\r\nof its Course, which must stop its Current near the Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd the Air amongst sown Corn is like Water amongst Reeds or Osiers in\r\nthe Side of a River; it is so stopp’d in its Course, that it almost\r\nbecomes an Eddy; and since Air is about Eight hundred Times lighter\r\nthan Water, we may suppose its Current thro’ the Corn is more easily\r\nretarded, especially near the Earth, where the Corn has occasion for\r\nthe greatest Quantity of Air to pass: For, tho’ the upper Part of the\r\nWheat be not able to stop a slow Current of Air, yet it does so much\r\nraise even a swift one, as to throw it off from the Ground, and hinder\r\nit from reaching the lower Parts of the Stalks, where the Air must\r\ntherefore remain, in a manner, stagnant; and the thicker the Wheat is,\r\nwhere it stands promiscuously, the less Change of Air can it have, tho’\r\nthe greater the Number of the Stalks is, the more fresh Air they must\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nBut the confused Manner in which the Plants of sown Wheat stand, is\r\nsuch, that they must all oppose the free Entrance of Air amongst them,\r\nfrom whatever Point of the Compass it comes.\r\n\r\nNow it is quite otherwise with Wheat drill’d regularly with wide\r\nIntervals; for therein the Current of Air may pass freely (like Water\r\nin a strait River, where there is no Resistance), and communicate\r\nits Nitre to the lower as well as upper Leaves, and carry off the\r\nRecrements they emit, not suffering the Plants to be weakened, as\r\nan Animal is, when his Lungs are forc’d to take back their own\r\nExpirations, if debarr’d from a sufficient Supply of fresh untainted\r\nAir. And this Benefit of fresh Air is plentifully, and pretty equally,\r\ndistributed to every Row in a Field of ho’d Wheat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThirdly, _Want of the Sun’s Rays_.\r\n\r\nSown Wheat-plants, by their irregular Position, may be said to stand in\r\none another’s Light, for want of which they are apt to fall.\r\n\r\n’Tis true the whole Field of Plants receive the same Quantity of\r\nSun-beams amongst them, whether they stand confusedly, or in Order: But\r\nthere is a vast Difference in the Distribution of them; for none or the\r\nvery least Share of Beams is obtain’d by those Parts which need the\r\ngreatest Share, in the confused Plants. And when the crural Parts, that\r\nshould support the whole Body of every Plant, are depriv’d of their\r\ndue Share of what is so necessary to strengthen them, the Plants (like\r\nAnimals in the same Case) are unable to stand.\r\n\r\nBut in drill’d Wheat, where the Plants stand in a regular Order, the\r\nSun-beams are more duly distributed to all Parts of the Plants in the\r\nRanks; for which Way soever the Rows are directed, if they be strait,\r\nthe Rays must, some time of the Day, fall on the Intervals, and be\r\nreflected by the Ground, whence the lower Parts of the Wheat-stalks\r\nmust receive the greater Share of Heat, being nearest to the Point of\r\nIncidence, having no Weeds to shadow them.\r\n\r\nAs to that Cause of the Blight, _viz._ the Wheat’s dying before the\r\nfull Time of its Pregnancy be accomplish’d; the Hoe removes all the\r\nObjections against planting early, and then it will blossom the\r\nearlier: And it has visibly kept Wheat green a whole Week longer, than\r\nunho’d Wheat adjoining to it, planted the same Day.\r\n\r\nThe Antients were perfect Masters of the Vine-Husbandry, which seems\r\nto have so engross’d their rural Studies, that it did not allow them\r\nso much Reflection, as to apply the Use of those Methods to the\r\nIncrease of Bread, which they had discover’d to be most beneficial for\r\nthe Increase of Wine. One Method was, to hoe the Vines after they had\r\nblossom’d, in order to fill the Fruit, as in _Columella_, Lib. iv.\r\nCap. 28. _Convenit tum crebris Fossionibus implere: nam fit ulterior\r\nPulverationibus._ And if what _Palladius_ says, _Tit._ ix. be true of\r\nthe Sarritions and Sarculations in the Month of _January_, and that if\r\nBeans do twice undergo that scratching Operation, they will produce\r\nmuch Fruit, and so large as to fill the Bushel almost as full when\r\nshal’d as unshal’d.\r\n\r\n_Faba, si bis sarculetur, proficiet, & multum Fructum & maximum\r\nafferet, ut ad Mensuram Modii complendi fresa propemodum sicut Integra\r\nrespondeat._\r\n\r\nThis is to be done when Beans are Four Fingers high, and Corn when it\r\nhas Four or Five Leaves to a Plant; even then the Harrowing-work, tho’\r\nit tore up some of the Plants, yet it was observ’d to do Good against\r\nthe Blight.\r\n\r\n_Si siccas Segetes sarculaveris, aliquid contra Rubiginem præstitisti,\r\nmaxime si Ordeum siccum sarrietur._\r\n\r\nWhen the Antients observ’d this, ’tis a Wonder they did not plant their\r\nCorn so as to be capable of receiving this Benefit in Perfection. They\r\nmight have imagin’d, that what was effectual against the Blight, when\r\nthe Corn was in Grass, must, in all Probability, be much more effectual\r\nwhen in Ear.\r\n\r\nBut the most general Blight that happens to Wheat in cold Climates,\r\nis caused by Insects, which (some think) are brought in the Air by\r\nan East Wind accompanied with Moisture, a little before the Grain is\r\nfilling with that milky Juice, which afterwards hardens into Flour.\r\nThese Insects deposit their Eggs within the outer Skin (or Rind) of\r\nthe Stalks; and when the young ones are hatched, they feed on the\r\n_Parenchyma_, and eat off many of the Vessels which should make and\r\nconvey this Juice; and then the Grain will be more or less thin, in\r\nProportion to the Number of Vessels eaten, and as the Insects happen\r\nto come earlier or later; for sometimes they come so late, that the\r\nGrain is sufficiently fill’d with the said milky Juice before the\r\nVessels are eaten; and then, tho’ the Straw appear thro’ a Microscope\r\nto have its Vessels very much eaten and torn, and to be full of black\r\nSpots (which Spots are nothing else but the Excrements of those young\r\nInsects), yet the Grain is plump, and not blighted, there being an\r\nObservation, That the early sown Wheat generally escapes this Blight.\r\nAnd it has been seen, where one Part of a Field is sown earlier than\r\nthe other Part, without any other Difference than the Time of sowing,\r\nthat the Grain of the latest sown has been much blighted, and the\r\nGrain of the earlier has escaped the Blight, tho’ the Straw of both\r\nwere equally eaten by the Insects. Hence it may be inferr’d, that the\r\nMilk in the one had receiv’d all the Nourishment necessary to its due\r\nConsistence, before the Vessels were destroy’d; but, in the other,\r\nthe Vessels, which should have continued the Supply of Nourishment\r\nfor thickening the Milk, being spoil’d before they have finish’d that\r\nOffice, it remains too thin; and then the Grain, when it hardeneth,\r\nshrinks up, and is blighted; yet the Grain of one and the other are\r\nequally plump until they become hard: The Difference therefore is only\r\nin the Thickness of the Milk, that in the blighted being more watery\r\nthan the other.\r\n\r\nThe chief Argument to prove, that these Insects are brought by an East\r\nWind, is, that the Wheat on the East Sides of Hedges are much blighted,\r\nwhen that on the West Sides is not hurt: And as to the Objection, that\r\nthey are bred in the Earth, and crawl thence up the Stalks of the\r\nWheat, because some Land is much more subject to produce blighted Wheat\r\nthan other Land is; perhaps this Difference may be chiefly owing to the\r\ndifferent Situation of those Lands, as they are opposed to the _East_,\r\nor to the _West_.\r\n\r\nAnother Cause why some Wheat is more blighted than other Wheat on the\r\nsame Land, is, the different Condition in which the Insects find it;\r\nfor the Rind of that which is very strong and flourishing[157] is soft\r\nand tender; into this they can easily penetrate to lay their Eggs; but\r\nthe Wheat that is poor and yellow, has an hard tough skin (or Rind),\r\ninto which the Insects are not able to bore for the Intromission of\r\ntheir Eggs, and therefore can do it no Mischief. It would be in vain to\r\nadvise to prevent the Blight, by striving to make the Wheat poor; for\r\ntho’ Poverty may preserve Wheat from this Blight, as well as it does\r\nPeople from the Gout, yet that is a Remedy which few take willingly\r\nagainst either of these Diseases: But this, I think, might be possible\r\nto remedy it, if we could, from the strongest Wheat, take away so much\r\nNourishment as to turn its Colour[158] a little yellowish just before\r\nthe Insects come[159] which I suppose to be in _June_, after the Ear is\r\nout, or at least fully formed.\r\n\r\n  [157] Some Sort of Land is more subject to this Blight than others;\r\n  in such, Lammas Wheat must by no means be drill’d late, and too\r\n  thin, lest it should not tiller till late in the Spring; and then,\r\n  for want of a sufficient Quantity of Stalks to dispense with all the\r\n  Nourishment rais’d by the Hoe, may become too vigorous and luxuriant,\r\n  and be the more liable to the Injury of the Blight of Insects.\r\n\r\n  [158] But this is a very difficult Matter.\r\n\r\n  [159] Whither those Insects go, or where they reside, from the Time\r\n  of their eating their Way out of the Straw, until they return the\r\n  next Year, I cannot learn.\r\n\r\nYet this can only be done in wide Intervals; for, unless the fine Earth\r\ncan be thrust to some considerable Distance from the Roots after they\r\nare cut off, they will soon shoot out again, and reach it, becoming\r\nmore vigorous thereby.\r\n\r\nIn dry Summers this Misfortune seldom happens, much Heat, and very\r\nlittle Moisture, being most agreeable to the Constitution of Wheat; for\r\nthen its Rind is more firm and hard, as it is, on the contrary, made\r\nmore soft and spongy by too much Moisture.\r\n\r\nThe most easy and sure Remedy, that I have yet found against the Injury\r\nof these Insects, is, to plant a Sort of Wheat that is least liable\r\nto be hurt by them; _viz._ The _White-cone_ (or bearded) _Wheat_,\r\nwhich has its Stalk or Straw like a Rush, not hollow, but full of Pith\r\n(except near the lower Part, and there ’tis very thick and strong):\r\n’Tis probable it has Sap-Vessels that lie deeper, so as the young\r\nInsects cannot totally destroy them, as they do in other Wheat: For\r\nwhen the Straw has the black Spots, which shew that the Insects have\r\nbeen there bred, yet the Grain is plump, when the Grey-cone and Lammas\r\nWheat mixt with it are blighted. This Difference might have been from\r\nthe different times of ripening, this being ripe about a Week earlier\r\nthan the Grey-cone, and later than the Lammas: But its being planted\r\ntogether both early and late, and at all Times of the Wheat-seed\r\nTime, and this White-cone always escaping with its Grain unhurt, is\r\nan Argument, that ’tis naturally fortify’d against the Injury of\r\nthese Insects, which in wet Summers are so pernicious to other Sorts\r\nof Wheat; and I can impute it to no other Cause than the different\r\nDeepness of the Vessels, the Straw of other Wheat being very much\r\nthinner, and hollow from Top to Bottom; this having a small Hollow at\r\nBottom, and there the Thickness betwixt the outer Skin and the Cavity\r\nis more than double to that in other Sorts of Wheat; so that I imagine,\r\nthe Insects reach only the outermost Vessels, and enough of the inner\r\nVessels are left untouch’d to supply the Grain.\r\n\r\nThis Wheat makes very good Bread, if the Miller does not grind it too\r\nsmall, or the Baker make his Dough too hard, it requiring to be made\r\nsofter than that of other Flour.\r\n\r\nA Bushel of this White-cone Wheat will make more Bread than a Bushel of\r\nLammas, and of the same Goodness; but it gives a little yellow Cast to\r\nthe Bread.\r\n\r\nAnother Sort of lodging Blight there is, which some call _Moar-Loore_,\r\nand mostly happens on light Land. This is when the Earth, sinking away\r\nfrom the Roots, leaves the Bottom of the Stalk higher than the subsided\r\nGround; and then the Plant, having only these naked Roots to support it\r\n(for which they are too weak), falls down to the Earth.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this, turn a shallow Furrow against the Rows, when they are\r\nstrong enough to bear it, and when the Mould is very fine and dry;\r\nthen the Motion of the Stalks by the Wind will cause such Earth to run\r\nthrough the Rows, and settle about the Roots, and cover them[160].\r\n\r\n  [160] Some Land is very subject to the Misfortune of exposing the\r\n  Roots, and therefore is less proper for Wheat; for when the Roots are\r\n  left bare to the Air, they will be shrivelled, and unable to support\r\n  the Plants: And on such Land the Wheat plants have all fallen down,\r\n  though in Number and Bigness not sufficient to have produced the\r\n  Fourth Part of a tolerable Crop, if they had stood. I am inclined to\r\n  believe, that a thorough Tillage might be a Remedy to such a loose\r\n  hollow Soil; for ’tis certain to a Demonstration, that it would\r\n  render it more _dense_, and increase its specific Gravity: But to\r\n  enrich it sufficiently without Manure, the Tillage must pulverize it\r\n  much more minutely, and expose it longer, than is required for the\r\n  strongest Land: The Fold also will be very helpful on such hollow\r\n  Land.\r\n\r\nI have never seen any drill’d Wheat so much spoil’d by falling, as sewn\r\nWheat sometimes is. The drill’d never falls so close to the Ground, but\r\nthat the Air enters into Hollows that are under it, and the Wind keeps\r\nthe Ears in Motion. Notwithstanding all the Precaution that can be\r\nused, in some unseasonable Years Wheat will be blighted: I have known\r\nsuch a general Blight, when some of my Lammas Wheat, planted late on\r\nblighting Land, was blighted, amongst the rest of my Neighbours, by\r\nthe Insects, but the Grain of the sown Wheat was vastly more injured\r\nthan that of the drill’d: The former was so _light_, that the greatest\r\nPart was blown away in winnowing, and the Remainder so _bad_, that it\r\nwas not fit to make Bread: The drill’d made as good Bread, and had as\r\nmuch Flour in it, as the sown Wheat had, that was not blighted; for the\r\nGrains of the drill’d were much larger than those of the sown; being\r\nform’d to have been twice as big as the Grains of Wheat generally are,\r\nhad they not been blighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n_Of_ ST. FOIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Foin, from the Country we brought it from, is call’d _French\r\nGrass_: And for its long Continuance, some having lasted Forty Years,\r\n’tis call’d _Everlasting Grass_, tho’ it be not strictly a _Gramen_.\r\n\r\n’Tis call’d in _French_, _Sain Foin_, i. e. _Sanum Fœnum_, from its\r\nQuality of Wholsomeness, beyond the other artificial Grasses, green and\r\ndry. ’Tis also call’d _Sanctum Fœnum_, Holy Hay.\r\n\r\n’Tis a Plant so generally known to every Body, that there is no need\r\nto give any formal Description of that Part of it which appears\r\nabove-ground, It has many red Flowers, sometimes leaving Ears Five or\r\nSix Inches long: I have measured the Stalks, and found them above Five\r\nFeet long, tho’ they are commonly but about Two Feet.\r\n\r\nThe Reason why _St. Foin_ will, in poor Ground, make a Forty times\r\ngreater Increase than the natural Turf, is the prodigious Length[161]\r\nof its perpendicular Tap-root: It is said to descend Twenty or Thirty\r\nFeet. I have been inform’d, by a Person of undoubted Credit, that he\r\nhas broken off one of these Roots in a Pit, and measured the Part\r\nbroken off, and found it fourteen Feet.\r\n\r\n  [161] There is a vulgar Opinion, that _St. Foin_ will not succeed on\r\n  any Land, where there is not an under _Stratum_ of Stone or Chalk,\r\n  to stop the Roots from running deep; else, they say, the Plants\r\n  spend themselves in the Roots only, and cannot thrive in those Parts\r\n  of them which are above the Ground. I am almost ashamed to give an\r\n  Answer to this.\r\n\r\n  ’Tis certain that every Plant is nourished from its Roots (as an\r\n  Animal is by its Guts); and the more and larger Roots it has, the\r\n  more Nourishment it receives, and prospers in proportion to it. _St.\r\n  Foin_ always succeeds where its Roots run deep; and when it does\r\n  not succeed, it never lives to have long Roots; neither can there\r\n  ever be found a Plant of it, that lives so long as to root deep in\r\n  a Soil that is improper for it: Therefore ’tis amazing to hear such\r\n  Reasoning from Men.\r\n\r\n  An under _Stratum_ of very strong Clay, or other Earth, which holds\r\n  Water, may make a Soil improper for it; because the Water kills the\r\n  Root, and never suffers it to grow to Perfection, or to attain to its\r\n  natural Bulk. The best _St. Foin_ that ever I saw, had nothing in the\r\n  Soil to obstruct the Roots, and it has been found to have Roots of a\r\n  prodigious Depth. If there be Springs near (or within several Feet\r\n  of) the Surface of the Soil, _St. Foin_ will die therein in Winter,\r\n  even after it has been vigorous in the first Summer; and also after\r\n  it hath produced a great Crop in the second Summer.\r\n\r\nThis Tap-root has also a Multitude of very long horizontal Roots at the\r\nupper Part thereof, which fill all the upper _Stratum_, or Staple of\r\nthe Ground; and of thousands of _St. Foin_ Roots I have seen taken up,\r\nI never found one that was without horizontal Roots near the Surface,\r\nafter one Summer’s Growth; and do much wonder how Mr. _Kerkham_ should\r\nbe so mistaken, as to think they have none such.\r\n\r\nAlso these Tap-roots have the horizontal ones all the Way down; but as\r\nthey descend, they are still shorter and shorter, as the uppermost are\r\nalways the longest.\r\n\r\nAny dry Ground may be made to produce this noble Plant, be it never so\r\npoor; but the richest Soil will yield the most of it, and the best.\r\n\r\nIf you venture to plant it with the Drill, according to the Method\r\nwherein I have always had the best Success; let the Land be well\r\nprepared before you plant it. The Seed, if not well ordered, will very\r\nlittle of it grow; therefore ’tis convenient to try it in the manner\r\nmention’d in the Chapter of _Hoeing_; where are also Directions to find\r\nthe proper Quantity and Depth to plant it at: I have observ’d, that the\r\nHeads of these Seeds are so large, and their Necks so weak[162], that\r\nif they lie much more than half an Inch[163] deep, they are not able to\r\nrise through the incumbent Mould; or if they are not cover’d, they will\r\nbe malted[164]. A Bushel to an Acre is full twenty Seeds to each square\r\nFoot, in all I try’d; but there is odds in the Largeness of it, which\r\nmakes some Difference in the Number.\r\n\r\n  [162] The Kernel or Seed, being much swollen in the Ground, I call\r\n  the Head: This, when it reaches above the Ground, opens in the\r\n  Middle, and is formed into the Two first Leaves; the Husk always\r\n  remaining at the same Depth at which it is cover’d: The String that\r\n  passes from the Husk to the Head, is the Neck; which, when by its too\r\n  great Length ’tis unable to support the Head till it reaches to the\r\n  Air, rises up, and doubles above it; and when it does so, the Head,\r\n  being turn’d with its Top downwards, never can rise any higher, but\r\n  there rots in the Ground.\r\n\r\n  [163] In very light Land the Seed will come up from a greater Depth;\r\n  but the most secure Way is, not to suffer it to be cover’d deep in\r\n  any Land.\r\n\r\n  [164] We say it is malted, when it lies above-ground, and sends out\r\n  its Root, which is killed by the Air. And whether we plant _bad_ Seed\r\n  that does not grow, or _good_ Seed buried or malted, the Consequence\r\n  will be much the same, and the Ground may be equally understock’d\r\n  with Plants.\r\n\r\nThe worst Seasons to plant it are the Beginning of Winter, and in the\r\nDrought of Summer. The best Season is early in the Spring.\r\n\r\n’Tis the stronger when planted alone, and when no other Crop is sown\r\nwith it[165].\r\n\r\n  [165] The worst Crop that can be sown amongst _St. Foin_, is Clover\r\n  or Rye-Grass; Barley or Oats continue but a little while to rob it;\r\n  but the other artificial Grasses rob it for a Year or Two, until the\r\n  artificial Pasture is near lost; and then the St. Foin never arrives\r\n  to half the Perfection as it will do when no other Grass is sown\r\n  amongst it.\r\n\r\n  The Injury these Hay-crops do to the St. Foin is best seen where some\r\n  Parts of the same Field have them, and the other Parts are without\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nIf Barley, Oats, or other Corn sown with St. Foin, do lodge, it will\r\nkill[166] the young St. Foin that is under it: But then so great a Crop\r\nof Corn will certainly answer the very little Expence of drilling the\r\nSt. Foin again, either the next Year, or as soon as the Corn is off the\r\nGround.\r\n\r\n  [166] When Barley, among which the St. Foin is planted in a dry\r\n  Summer, is great, there are few Farmers that know till the next\r\n  Spring, whether the St. Foin succeeds or not; because the young\r\n  Plants are not then visible; unless it be to those who are accustomed\r\n  to observe them in all the Degrees of their Growth. I have seen a\r\n  Field of Ten Acres of such, wherein, after the Barley was carried\r\n  off, nothing appeared like St. Foin; but when by the Print of the\r\n  Chanels I searched diligently, I found the small St. Foin Plants\r\n  thick enough in the Rows; they had no Leaves, they being cut off by\r\n  the Scythe; no Part of them that was left had any Green Colour; but\r\n  from the Plants there came out many Sprigs like Hog’s Bristles, or\r\n  like the Beard of Barley: This whole Piece of St. Foin succeeded so\r\n  well, that the Third Year its Crop was worth Three Pounds _per_ Acre,\r\n  the Land being good.\r\n\r\nSt. Foin drill’d betwixt Rows of Barley or Oats, always is stronger\r\nthan when drill’d amongst Corn that is sown at random; and therefore is\r\nin less Danger of being kill’d by the Lodging of the Corn; neither is\r\nthe Corn in Rows so liable to fall as the other.\r\n\r\nThe Quantity of Seed to be drill’d on an Acre will depend, in great\r\nMeasure, upon the Goodness of it; for in some bad Seed, not more than\r\nOne in Ten will grow; and in good Seed, not One in Twenty will miss;\r\nwhich is best known by stripping off the Husks of a certain Number of\r\nSeeds, and planting the Kernels in Earth, in the manner directed for\r\nfinding the proper Depth to plant at, which, in this Case, let be half\r\nan Inch: This being done, the Quality of the Seed will be known. But\r\nuntil frequent Trials have furnish’d Experience enough to the Planter\r\nto know the Difference, let him observe, that the following are good\r\nSigns; _viz._ The Husk of a bright Colour, the Kernel plump, of a\r\nlight-grey or blue Colour, or sometimes of a shining black; yet the\r\nSeed may be good, tho’ the Husk is of a dark Colour, if that is caused\r\nby its receiving Rain in the Field, and not by heating in a Heap, or in\r\nthe Mow; and if you cut the Kernel off in the Middle, cross-ways, and\r\nfind the Inside of a Greenish fresh Colour, it’s surely good; but if of\r\na yellowish Colour, and friable about the Navel, and thin, or pitted,\r\nthese are Marks of bad Seed.\r\n\r\nThe Quantity, or rather Number of Seeds convenient to drill, ought to\r\nbe computed by the Number of Plants[167] we propose to have for making\r\nthe best Crop, allowing for Casualties[168].\r\n\r\n  [167] Not that we need to be so exact as to the Number of Plants,\r\n  whether they be Two, Three, or Four hundred upon a square Perch.\r\n  Neither is it possible to know beforehand the precise Number of\r\n  Plants that may live; for sometimes the Grub kills many, by eating\r\n  off the first Two Leaves.\r\n\r\n  [168] Many even of the best of Seeds, both sown and drill’d, are\r\n  liable to Casualties, but not equally; for about Twenty-eight Years\r\n  ago, my Servants (being prime Seedsmen) had a Fancy in my Absence to\r\n  try an Experiment of the Difference betwixt sowing and drilling of\r\n  St. Foin; and in the Middle of a large Field of my best Land they\r\n  sow’d a square Piece of Three Acres, at the Rate of One Bushel to\r\n  an Acre, not doubting but, by their skill in sowing even, it would\r\n  succeed as well as if drill’d; but it succeeded so much against\r\n  their Expectation, that the Land all round it, which was drill’d at\r\n  the same Time, with the same Proportion of the same Seed, brought\r\n  extraordinary good Crops of St. Foin; but the sow’d Part was so very\r\n  thin, that tho’ it lay still with the rest for Eight Years, it never\r\n  was a Crop, there not being above Three or Four upon a square Perch,\r\n  taking the Three Acres all together: Not that it can be supposed,\r\n  that the sown would always meet with so many Casualties as this did;\r\n  for then Eight Bushels sown to an Acre might have been too thin, and\r\n  much thinner than all the rest of the Field was, tho’ drill’d with\r\n  only One Bushel to an Acre: And ’tis often seen, that when an Acre is\r\n  sown with seven Bushels of Seed, the St. Foin is as much too thick,\r\n  as that sown with One Bushel was too thin.\r\n\r\n  I do not know, that of the many hundred Acres of St. Foin, that have\r\n  been drill’d for me, ever one Acre was too thin, except when planted\r\n  with Wheat: The young Plants were kill’d by the Frost.\r\n\r\nIn drilling St. Foin not to be ho’d, and before the Ploughs of my Drill\r\nwere so perfect in making narrow Chanels as they are now (for, when the\r\nChanels were open, they had Six times the Breadth, wherein Part of the\r\nSeed was wasted), then my Quantity was One Bushel to an Acre, sometimes\r\nSix Gallons.\r\n\r\nBut a single Acre (in the middle of a large Field of St. Foin) being\r\ndrill’d late in _October_, the frosty Winter kill’d at least Nineteen\r\nof Twenty Parts[169] of that Bushel. At first it made such a poor\r\nAppearance, that ’twas by mere Accident, or it had been plow’d up for\r\na Fallow; but, missing of that, a few Plants were perceiv’d in the\r\nSummer, which by their Singleness grew so vigorous, and so very large,\r\nthat the Second Year of Mowing it[170] produc’d a Crop double to the\r\nrest of the same Field, which was drill’d in the Spring, with the same\r\nProportion of Seed, and none of it kill’d: tho’ all this Field was a\r\nmuch better Crop than some that was sown in the common Manner, with\r\nSeven Bushels to an Acre. I have generally observ’d the thin[171] to\r\nmake the best Crop, after the First or Second Year.\r\n\r\n  [169] But I believe, there might remain alive Three or Four Plants to\r\n  each square Yard, standing single, and at pretty equal Distances.\r\n\r\n  [170] But _Note_, This Acre was dunged, and in better Order than the\r\n  rest.\r\n\r\n  [171] But, notwithstanding I commend the Planting of St. Foin thin,\r\n  that most of the Roots may be single; yet I have Fields that were\r\n  drill’d with but Four Gallons of Seed to an Acre; and yet the Rows\r\n  being Seven Inches asunder, the Roots are so thick in them, that the\r\n  Ground is cover’d with the St. Foin Plants, which seem to be as thick\r\n  (in Appearance) as most sown St. Foin, whereon Seven or Eight Bushels\r\n  are sown on an Acre. And I have other Fields that were drill’d\r\n  with about Two Gallons of Seed to an Acre (which is Five Seeds to\r\n  each square Foot), the Rows Sixteen Inches asunder, that produce\r\n  better Crops, tho’ the Ground be poorer. The drill’d St. Foin, being\r\n  regular, is more single, tho’ as thick as the sown; and for that\r\n  Reason always makes a better Crop, and lasts longer than the sown\r\n  that is of the same Thickness, but irregular.\r\n\r\nI have also often observ’d in Lands of St. Foin, lying dispersed in a\r\ncommon Field (but where there was not Common for Sheep), and where the\r\nEnds of other Lands kept in Tillage, pointed against the Pieces of St.\r\nFoin, and the Horses and Ploughs turning out upon the St. Foin[172] did\r\nplow and scratch out a Multitude of its Plants; so that it was thought\r\nto be spoil’d, and Law-suits were intended for Recompence of the\r\nDamage; that afterwards this scratch’d Part, supposed to be spoil’d,\r\nbecame twice as good as the rest of the same Pieces, where the Ploughs\r\ndid not come to tear up any Plants.\r\n\r\n  [172] This Plowing and Scratching was a sort of Hoeing, which helped\r\n  the St. Foin by a small Degree of Pulveration, as well as by making\r\n  the Plants thinner.\r\n\r\nThe Reason why the single St. Foin Plants make the greatest Crops, is,\r\nthat the Quantity of the Crop is always in Proportion to the Quantity\r\nof Nourishment it receives from the Earth; and those Plants which run\r\ndeepest will receive most; and such as are single will run deeper than\r\nthose which are not single.\r\n\r\nAlso the single do send out all round them horizontal Roots,\r\nproportionably stronger and larger, whereby they are better able to\r\npenetrate, and extract more Nourishment from the Staple, or upper\r\n_Stratum_, than the other can do, if there be a competent Number; which\r\nis, when ho’d, fewer than any-body imagines. ’Tis common to see a\r\nsingle St. Foin have a bigger Tap-root than Twenty thick ones: Their\r\nLength is in Proportion to their Bigness: Therefore that single Plant\r\nmay well be supposed to have Twenty times more Depth of Earth to supply\r\nit, than all those Twenty small Roots can reach to. And tho’ these\r\nunder _Strata_ are not so rich as the upper; yet, never having been\r\ndrain’d by any Vegetable, they do afford a very considerable Quantity\r\nof Nourishment to those Roots which first enter them.\r\n\r\nThe small thick Plants are so far from equalling the Product of the\r\nsingle, by their Excess of Number, that the more they are, the smaller,\r\nshorter, and weaker they become; less Nourishment they have, and the\r\nless Crop they produce; and are soon starv’d, decay, and die, unless\r\nreliev’d by the Expence of frequent Manure, or that the Soil be very\r\nrich.\r\n\r\nSingle Plants exceed the other by a Multitude of Degrees, more than a\r\nGiant does a Dwarf, in Strength, as well as Stature; and therefore when\r\nnatural Grass happens to come, are so much the better able to shift\r\namongst it.\r\n\r\nThe single Plants seem also to exceed the other in their Longevity; for\r\n’tis observ’d, that all St. Foin that has continu’d great for a good\r\nNumber of Years without Manure, has been so single, that the Owners\r\nhave determined to plow it up at the Beginning, for the Thinness of it.\r\n\r\nHow long this may last by Culture, I can’t tell; but undoubtedly much\r\nlonger than without it; and I can say, that I never knew a Plant of St.\r\nFoin die a natural Death; the most common End of it is Starving. And\r\nwhen an hundred thick Plants have not the Nourishment which One single\r\nPlant has, ’tis no Wonder that these (in a Croud[173] thus besieg’d\r\nwith Hunger) should be starv’d before it.\r\n\r\n  [173] Sown Plants, when too thick, are crouded on every Side; but\r\n  those that are drill’d, have always Room enough on Two Sides of them;\r\n  unless the Rows are too near together.\r\n\r\nAnother Advantage the single have, in respect of Moisture: These reach\r\nto a Depth where that is never wanting, even when the upper _Stratum_\r\nor Staple is parch’d up, as appears by the Experiment of the Mints,\r\nthat if any Root of a Plant has Moisture, that Root will communicate a\r\nShare to all the rest. Hence it is, that, in the driest Summer, these\r\nsingle Plants make a great Crop, when the other yield next to nothing.\r\nI remember I once saw a Farmer coming out of a Ground with a Load of\r\nSt. Foin Hay, which he assured me was all he could find worth cutting,\r\nout of Forty Acres of this thick sort, in full Perfection, Three Years\r\nafter sowing: He valued his Load at Three Pounds; but withal said it\r\ncame off so much Ground, that the Expence of Mowing, Raking, _&c._ was\r\nmore than the Value; when, in the very same dry Summer, there was Three\r\nTun of St. Foin to an Acre in a Field[174], where it was drill’d single\r\nand regularly.\r\n\r\n  [174] This was on rich deep Land in _Oxfordshire_; and the other St.\r\n  Foin, which was so poor, was on thin Slate Land near _Causham_ in\r\n  _Wiltshire_ in the _Bath Road_. It is now about Forty Years since.\r\n\r\nAnd I have often observ’d, that where the Plants are thin, the Second\r\nCrop of them springs again immediately after cutting; when Plants that\r\nstand thick in the same Ground, spring not till Rain comes; and I have\r\nseen the thin grown high enough to cut the Second time, before the\r\nother began to spring.\r\n\r\nThe best way to find what Number of these Plants it is proper to have\r\non a Perch of Ground, is to consider what Quantity of Hay one large\r\nPlant will produce (for, if cultivated, they will be all such).\r\n\r\nWithout Culture these Plants never attain to a Fourth Part of the Bulk\r\nthey do with it: Therefore very few have seen any one Plant at its full\r\nBigness. One Plant, well cultivated, has in the same Ground made a\r\ngreater Produce, than One thousand small ones uncultivated.\r\n\r\nBut the Hay of a large single cultivated Plant will weigh more than\r\nhalf a Pound; and 112 Plants upon a square Perch, weighing but a\r\nQuarter of a Pound apiece one with another, amount to Two Tun to an\r\nAcre.\r\n\r\nIf St. Foin be planted on some sorts of Land early in the Spring, and\r\nho’d, it may bring a Crop the same Summer; for I once planted a few\r\nSeeds of it on sandy Ground in my Garden, at the End of _February_,\r\nwhich produced large Plants above Two Feet high, that went into Blossom\r\nthe following _June_; tho’ there was a severe Frost in _March_, which\r\nkill’d abundance of Wheat, yet did not hurt these Plants: This shews\r\nthat St. Foin is a quick Grower, unless it be planted on poor cold\r\nGround, or for Want of Culture.\r\n\r\nAnd tho’ the poor Land, and ill Management generally allotted to it,\r\ncause it to yield but One mowing Crop a Year; yet it has yielded Two\r\ngreat ones on rich sandy Land, even when sown in the common ordinary\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThin St. Foin cannot be expected to cover all the Ground at first,\r\nany more than an Orchard of Apple-trees will, when first planted at\r\nThirty Feet Distance from each other every Way; yet this is reckon’d a\r\nproper Distance to make a good and lasting Orchard. But if these should\r\nbe planted at Three Feet Distance, as they stand in the Nursery, it\r\nwould not be more unreasonable than the common Method of sowing St.\r\nFoin is; and there would be much the same Consequence in both, from\r\ncovering all the Ground at first Planting; except that the St. Foin,\r\nbeing abundantly longer rooted downwards than Apple-trees are, has\r\nthe greater Disadvantage, when by its Thickness ’tis prevented from\r\ngrowing to its full Bulk, and Length of Roots[175].\r\n\r\n  [175] Horizontal-rooted Plants suffer no greater Injury by their\r\n  Pasture’s being over-stock’d than Cattle do; because their Pasture\r\n  lying near the Surface of the Ground, they have it all amongst them:\r\n  But St. Foin, and other long Tap-rooted Plants suffer yet more,\r\n  because great Part of their over-stock’d Pasture is lost by them all,\r\n  when they hinder one another from reaching down to it, by shortening\r\n  one another’s Roots, which they do when they all become Dwarfs by\r\n  reason of their Over-thickness.\r\n\r\nThe Difference is only this: People are accustom’d to see Apple-trees\r\nplanted at their due Distance: but few have seen St. Foin planted and\r\ncultivated at the Distance most proper to St. Foin; or ever consider’d\r\nabout it, so much as to make the necessary Trials.\r\n\r\nI have constantly found, that, upon doubling any Number of narrow\r\nRows, having equal Number of Plants in each Row, the Crops have been\r\nvery much diminish’d; and, upon leaving out every other Row, that is,\r\nlessening the Number of Rows to half, the Crops are increased; and\r\nwhere Two Rows are wide asunder at one End of a Piece, and near at the\r\nother End, the Plants are gradually less and less, as the Rows approach\r\nnearer together.\r\n\r\nWe ought never to expect a full Crop of St. Foin the First Year[176],\r\nif we intend to have good Crops afterwards, and that it shall continue\r\nto produce such, for the same Reasons that must be given for planting\r\nan Orchard at other Distances than a Nursery.\r\n\r\n  [176] But when it has been planted on rich sandy Land, and proper,\r\n  it has produced very great Crops the first Year; but then the Summer\r\n  wherein it grew amongst the Barley, must not be reckoned as the first\r\n  Year.\r\n\r\nThe common Error proceeds from mistaking the Cause of a great or small\r\nCrop.\r\n\r\nWhere the Spaces betwixt Rows are wide (if there be not too many Plants\r\nin them) we always see the St. Foin grow large, and make the greatest\r\nCrop; but when ’tis young, or after cutting, we see room (as we fansy)\r\nfor more of such Plants, to make a yet larger Crop; not considering\r\nthat ’tis the Wideness of those Spaces, and less Number of Plants,\r\nthat cause the Crop to be so large, there being more Pasture for those\r\nPlants.\r\n\r\nWhere these Spaces are narrower, and the Rows of equal Thickness, we\r\nsee the Plants less when grown, and that they make a less Crop; and yet\r\nthere seems to be room for more Rows, which we fansy might make the\r\nCrop larger, not considering that ’tis the Narrowness of those Spaces\r\nthat causes the Plants and Crop to be less, for want of sufficient\r\nPasture.\r\n\r\nThus, fondly increasing the Number of our Rows and Plants, we bring our\r\nCrop (unless the Soil be rich) to nothing, by too much over-stocking\r\ntheir Pasture; and, if that Pasture be over-stock’d, the Crop will be\r\ndiminish’d more than in proportion to that Over-charge; for perhaps\r\n’tis not impossible to prove (if we would be curious), that Plants, by\r\nwanting a Fourth Part of their due _Quantum_ of Nourishment, will be\r\ndiminish’d to half[177] of the Bulk they would have attained to, had\r\nthey been supply’d with the other Fourth Part.\r\n\r\n  [177] When Plants have not their due Nourishment, they suffer the\r\n  more by Cold and Drought; so that want of Nourishment diminishing\r\n  their Growth One-fourth, Cold, or Drought, or both, may diminish it\r\n  another fourth.\r\n\r\nI have observ’d ho’d St. Foin to grow more, and increase its Bulk more,\r\nin Two Weeks, than unho’d St. Foin in the same Ground (and without any\r\nother Difference) hath done in Six Weeks; and the quicker it grows, by\r\nbeing better fed, the sweeter and richer Food it will make for Cattle,\r\nwhether it be spent green or dry[178].\r\n\r\n  [178] Cattle are the best Judges of the Goodness of Grass, and they\r\n  always choose to feed on St. Foin that is most vigorous, and refuse\r\n  that which is poor and yellow. And the richest sweetest Grass will\r\n  always make the best Hay; for the drying of it does not change the\r\n  Quality of the Grass.\r\n\r\nAt whatever Distance the Rows be set, if they have too many Plants in\r\nthem, the Crop will be very much injured; and the greater the Excess is\r\nbeyond the just Number, the more void Space there will be amongst them;\r\nbecause the smaller the Plants are, the less Ground they cover.\r\n\r\nI have had the Experience of drilling at all Distances, from\r\nThirty-three Inches to Seven Inches, betwixt the Rows; and recommend\r\nthe following Distance, for the different Methods of drilling; whether\r\nthe _St. Foin_ be design’d for hoeing, or not. As,\r\n\r\nFirst, For _Horse-hoeing_, I think it is best to drill double Rows\r\nwith Eight-inch Partitions, and Thirty-inch Intervals; which need only\r\nbe ho’d alternately, leaving every other Interval for making the Hay\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\nIndeed I have never yet had a whole Field of ho’d _St. Foin_; but have\r\nenough to shew, that Horse-hoeing makes it strong upon very poor Land,\r\nand causes it to produce two Crops a Year upon indifferent Land.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to hoe this every Year; but we may intermit the\r\nHoeing for three or four Years together, or more, if the Land be good.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Plants are small the first Year, Care must be taken not to\r\ncover them with the Plough: Afterwards there will be no great Danger,\r\nespecially in Winter, the Earth not being suffered to lie on them too\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nSecondly, For _Hand-hoeing_, drill the Rows Sixteen Inches asunder, and\r\nsingle out the Plants, so as to make them Eight Inches apart at least\r\nin the Rows, contriving rather to leave the Master-plants, than to be\r\nexact in the Distance: This must be done whilst they are very young, or\r\nin Summer; else they will come again that are cut off by the Hoe.\r\n\r\nLastly, when _St. Foin_ is drill’d without any Intention of hoeing, the\r\nbest Way (I think) is to plant single Rows, at Eight Inches Distance,\r\nwith no greater Quantity of Seed, than when the Rows are at Sixteen\r\nInches Distance; because, by this Method, the same Number of Plants in\r\nthe Rows, that are but Eight Inches apart, will be much more single,\r\nthan those in the Rows at Sixteen Inches apart are, without being set\r\nout by the Hoe.\r\n\r\nWhich of these Methods soever is practis’d, the Land should be made\r\nas clean from all Grass, and as well pulveriz’d, as possible, before\r\nDrilling.\r\n\r\nThe Tines of the Drill-harrow must exactly follow the Shares, which\r\nleaving the Chanels open, the Tines cover the Seed, some at Bottom,\r\nand some on each Side; so that it is cover’d very shallow, tho’ it\r\nlies deep within the Ground, where there is more Moisture, than nearer\r\nto the upper level Surface: This causes the Seed to come up in dry\r\nWeather; and yet it is not in Danger of being buried by a too great\r\nWeight of Mould incumbent on it.\r\n\r\nBut take heed that no other Harrow come on it after ’tis drill’d; for\r\nthat might bury it. I never care to roll it at all, unless on account\r\nof the Barley; and then only in very dry Weather, with a light Roller,\r\nlengthways of the Rows, immediately after ’tis drill’d; or else stay\r\nThree Weeks afterwards before it be roll’d, for fear of breaking off\r\nthe Heads of the young _St. Foin_.\r\n\r\nBe sure to suffer no Cattle to come on the young _St. Foin_ the first\r\nWinter[179], after the Corn is cut that grows amongst it; their very\r\nFeet would injure it, by treading the Ground hard, as well as their\r\nMouths by cropping it; Nor let any Sheep come at it, even in the\r\nfollowing Summer and Winter.\r\n\r\n  [179] The first Winter is the Time to lay on Manure, after the Crop\r\n  of Corn is off; such as _Peat-Ashes_, or the like; because, there\r\n  being no natural Grass to partake of it, and the Plants being less,\r\n  less will supply them; and because, when made strong in their Youth,\r\n  they will come to greater Perfection: But I never used any Manure\r\n  on my _St. Foin_, because mine generally had no Occasion for Manure\r\n  before it was old; and _Soot_ is seldom to be had of sufficient\r\n  Quantity in the Country; and little _Coal_ is burnt hereabouts,\r\n  except by the _Smiths_, whose _Ashes_ are not good. The Price and\r\n  Carriage of _Peat-Ash_ will be Ten Shillings for an Acre, which would\r\n  yet be well bestowed in a Place where Hay is vendible; but, by reason\r\n  of the great Quantity of watered Meadows, and Plenty of St. Foin,\r\n  Clover, and Hay, raised of late Years by Farmers for their own Use,\r\n  here are now few or no Buyers of Hay, especially these open Winters;\r\n  so that laying out Money in that Manner would be in Effect to buy\r\n  what I cannot sell. I think it better to let a little more Land lie\r\n  still in St. Foin, than to be at the Expence of Manure; but yet shall\r\n  not neglect to use it, when I shall find it likely to be profitable\r\n  to me.\r\n\r\nOne Acre of well-drill’d _St. Foin_, considering the different Goodness\r\nof the Crops, and the Duration of it, is generally worth Two Acres\r\nof sown _St. Foin_ on the same Land, tho’ the Expence of drilling be\r\nTwenty Times less than the Expence of sowing it.\r\n\r\nOne of the Causes why _St. Foin_, that is properly drill’d, lasteth\r\nlonger[180] without Manure than the sown, is, That the former neither\r\nover nor understocks the Pasture; and the latter commonly, if not\r\nalways, doth one or the other, if not both; _viz._ Plants too thick in\r\nsome Places, and too thin in others; either ’tis not single, but in\r\nBunches; or if it be single, ’tis too thin; it being next to impossible\r\nto have the Plants come true and regular, or nearly so, by sowing at\r\n_random_. Plants too thick soon exhaust the Pasture they reach, which\r\nnever is more than a small Part of that below the Staple: When the\r\nPlants are too thin, the _St. Foin_ cannot be said to last at all,\r\nbecause it never is a Crop.\r\n\r\n  [180] I have now a great many single _St. Foin_ Plants in my Fields,\r\n  that are near Thirty Years of Age, and yet seem as young and vigorous\r\n  as ever; and yet it is common for thick _St. Foin_ to wear out in\r\n  Nine or Ten Years, and in poor Land much sooner, if not often manured\r\n  by _Soot_, _Peat-Ash_, or _Coal-Ash_.\r\n\r\nThey who _sow_ Eight or Ten Bushels of good Seed on an Acre, in a good\r\nSeason, among their Corn, with Intent that by its Thickness it should\r\nkill other Grass, reduce their _St. Foin_ almost to that poor Condition\r\nI have seen it in, where it grows naturally wild without sowing or\r\nTillage, upon the _Calabrian_ Hills near _Croto_: It makes there such a\r\ndespicable Appearance, that one would wonder how any body should have\r\ntaken it in their Head to propagate so unpromising a Plant; and yet\r\nthere has scarce been an Exotic brought to _England_ in this or the\r\nlast Age, capable of making a greater or more general Improvement, were\r\nit duly cultivated.\r\n\r\nSome think the _Cytisus_ would exceed it; but I am afraid the Labour of\r\nshearing those Shrubs by the Hands of _English_ Servants, would cost\r\ntoo much of its Profit.\r\n\r\n_Luserne_, requiring more Culture, and being much more difficult to be\r\nfitted with a proper Soil, never can be so general as _St. Foin_.\r\n\r\nBut now let us consider the best Methods of ordering _St. Foin_ for\r\nHay and Seed. The Profit of _St. Foin_ Fields, arising from either of\r\nthese Ways, is a great Advantage to their Owner, above that of natural\r\nMeadows; for, if Meadow-hay cannot have good Weather to be cut in its\r\nSeason, it can serve for little other Use than as Dung, and yet the\r\nExpence of mowing it, and carrying it off must not be omitted. But if\r\nthere be not Weather to cut _St. Foin_ before blossoming, we may expect\r\nit till in Flower, or may stay till the Blossoms are off; and if it\r\nstill rain on, may stand for Seed, and turn to as good Account as any\r\nof the former: So that it has Four Chances to One of the Meadow.\r\n\r\nThe elevated, but not mountainous, Situation of the dry Land whereon\r\n_St. Foin_ is mostly planted, renders it so commodious for making of\r\nHay, that it escapes there the Injury of Weather, when Hay in low\r\nMeadows is utterly spoil’d.\r\n\r\nOn the high Ground the Wind will dry more in an Hour, than on the\r\nMeadows in a whole Day. The Sun too has a more benign Influence above,\r\nand sends off the Dew about Two Hours earlier in the Morning, and\r\nholds it up as much longer in the Evening. By these Advantages the _St.\r\nFoin_ has the more Time to dry, and is made with half the Expence of\r\nMeadow-hay.\r\n\r\nBut before the Manner of making it be describ’d, the proper Time of\r\ncutting it ought to be determin’d; and upon that depend the Degrees of\r\nits Excellence (besides upon the Weather, which is not in our Power);\r\nfor tho’ all Sorts of this Hay, if well made, be good, yet there is a\r\nvast Difference and Variety in them.\r\n\r\nThe several Sorts may be principally distinguish’d by the following\r\nTerms; _viz._ First, The _Virgin_. Secondly, The _Blossom’d_. Thirdly,\r\nThe _Full-grown_. And, Fourthly, The _Thresh’d Hay_.\r\n\r\nThe First of these is best of all, beyond Comparison; and (except\r\n_Luserne_) has not in the World its Equal. This must be cut before\r\nthe Blossoms appear: For when it stands till full-blown, the most\r\nspirituous, volatile, and nourishing Parts of its Juices are spent on\r\nthe next Generation; and this being done all at once, the Sap is much\r\ndepauperated, and the _St. Foin_ can never recover that Richness it had\r\nin its Virgin State. And tho’, when in Blossom, it be _literally_ in\r\nthe _Flower_ of its Age, ’tis really in the _Declension_ of it. If it\r\nbe said, that what is not in the Stalk is gone into the Flower, ’tis a\r\nMistake; because much the greatest Part of its Quintessence perspires\r\nthence into the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnd moreover, That all Vegetables are, in some Degree, weaken’d by the\r\nAction of continuing their Kind, may be inferr’d from those Plants\r\nwhich will live several Years, if not suffer’d to blossom; but,\r\nwhenever they blossom, it causes their Death, tho’ in the first Year of\r\ntheir Life. For in Plants (as Dr. _Willis_ observes in Animals) Nature\r\nis more solicitous to continue the Species, than for the Benefit of the\r\nIndividual.\r\n\r\nPart of a drill’d _St. Foin_ Ground was cut the Beginning of _May_,\r\nbefore blossoming[181]; and from the Time of cutting, until it was set\r\nup in Ricks, being about Ten Days, the Sun never shone upon it[182];\r\nbut the Weather was misty: At last it was forc’d to be carried together\r\nfor fear of Rain, so green, that out of the largest Stalks one might\r\nwring milky Juice; yet by making the Hay up in several little Ricks,\r\nand drawing up a great Chaff Basket in the Middle of each, its Firing\r\nwas prevented; but it look’d of a dark Colour by heating; and was the\r\nvery best[183] Hay that ever I had.\r\n\r\n  [181] By cutting before blossoming, is not meant before any one\r\n  Blossom appears; for here and there a Bud will begin to open with a\r\n  red Colour long before the rest: Therefore, when we perceive only a\r\n  very few Blossoms beginning to open (perhaps but One of a Thousand),\r\n  we regard them as none.\r\n\r\n  [182] This also was an Advantage to this Hay; for Apothecaries find,\r\n  that Herbs dried in the Shade retain much more of their Virtue than\r\n  these dried in the Sun; but Farmers not having any such Conveniency\r\n  of drying their Hay in the Shade with Safety, must always choose\r\n  to dry it by the Sun; because in cloudy Weather there is Danger of\r\n  Rain; and therefore such excellent Hay must be had by Chance; for to\r\n  be well made in the Shade, it must be in Danger of being spoiled or\r\n  damaged by Rain.\r\n\r\n  [183] This Hay, so cut before blossoming, has kept a Team of working\r\n  Stone-horses, round the Year, fat without Corn; and when tried with\r\n  Beans and Oats mixed with Chaff, they refused it for this Hay. The\r\n  same fatted some Sheep in the Winter, in a Pen, with only it and\r\n  Water; they thrived faster than other Sheep at the same time fed with\r\n  Pease and Oats. The Hay was weighed to them, and the clear Profit\r\n  amounted to Four Pounds _per_ Tun. They made no Waste. Tho’ the\r\n  Stalks were of an extraordinary Bigness, they would break off short,\r\n  being very brittle. This grew on rich Ground in _Oxfordshire_.\r\n\r\nThe other Part of the Ground was afterwards cut in the Prime of its\r\nFlower, and made into Hay by the Heat of the Sun, without Rain or Mist:\r\nThis came out of the Ricks at Winter with a much finer Colour, and as\r\nfine a Smell as the Virgin Hay; but did not come near it in fatting of\r\nSheep, or keeping Horses fat at hard Work without any Corn, as the\r\nVirgin Hay did.\r\n\r\nThis superfine Hay cannot well be had of poor uncultivated[184] _St.\r\nFoin_: because that may not be much above an Handful high, when ’tis\r\nin Condition to be so cut; and would then make a very light Crop,\r\nand would be a great while ere it sprang up again: But the rich will\r\nhave Two or Three Tun to an Acre, and spring again immediately for a\r\nsecond Crop; so that little or no Quantity would be lost by so great\r\nan Improvement of its Quality. For ho’d _St. Foin_ upon a poor chalky\r\nHill, cut at the same time with that uncultivated on a rich Valley,\r\ndoes in dry Weather grow again without Delay, when the Valley attends a\r\nMonth or more for a Rain, to excite its vegetative Motion.\r\n\r\n  [184] I reckon Manure of _Peat-Ashes_, _Soot_, or the like, to be a\r\n  Culture.\r\n\r\nThis Hay the Owner (if he be wise) will not sell at any common Price;\r\nbut endeavour to have some of it every Year, if possible, for his own\r\nUse.\r\n\r\nThe Second Sort of _St. Foin_ Hay is that cut in the Flower; and tho’\r\nmuch inferior to the _Virgin_ Hay, it far exceeds any other Kind, as\r\nyet commonly propagated in _England_; and if it be a full Crop, by\r\ngood Culture, may amount to above three Tun to an Acre. This is that\r\n_St. Foin_ which is most commonly made; and the larger it is, the more\r\nnourishing for Horses. I have known Farmers, after full Experience, go\r\nThree Miles to fetch the largest stalky _St. Foin_, when they could\r\nhave bought the small fine leafy Sort of it at home, for the same Price\r\nby the Tun.\r\n\r\nThe next and last Sort of _St. Foin_ that is cut only for Hay, is, the\r\n_full-grown_, the Blossoms being gone, or going off: This also is good\r\nHay, tho’ it fall short, by many Degrees, of the other Two Sorts: It\r\nmakes a greater Crop than either of them, because it grows to its full\r\nBulk, and shrinks little in drying.\r\n\r\nThis gives the Owner a Third Chance of having Weather to make good Hay,\r\nand spins out the Hay-Season ’till about _Midsummer_; and then in about\r\na Fortnight, or Three Weeks; after the Hay is finish’d, the Seed is\r\nripe. But, first, of the manner of making _St. Foin_ Hay.\r\n\r\nIn a Day or Two after _St. Foin_ is mow’d, it will, in good Weather,\r\nbe dry on the upper Side: Then turn the Swarths, not singly, but Two\r\nand Two together; for by thus turning them in Pairs, there is a double\r\nSpace of Ground betwixt Pair and Pair, which needs but once raking;\r\nwhereas, if the Swarths were turn’d singly, that is, all the same Way,\r\nsuppose to the _East_ or _West_, then all the Ground will require to be\r\ntwice raked; at least, more of it, than the other Way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as both Sides of the Swarths are dry from Rain and Dew, make\r\nthem up into little Cocks the same Day they are turn’d, if conveniently\r\nyou can; for when ’tis in Cock, a less Part of it will be exposed to\r\nthe Injuries of the Night, than when in Swarth.\r\n\r\nDew, being of a nitrous penetrating Nature, enters the Pores of those\r\nPlants it reaches, and during the Night possesses the Room from whence\r\nsome Part of the Juices is dry’d out: Thus it intimately mixes with the\r\nremaining Sap; and, when the Dew is again exhal’d, it carries up most\r\nof the vegetable Spirits along with it, which might have been there\r\nfix’d, had they not been taken away in that subtile Vehicle.\r\n\r\nIf _St. Foin_ be spread very thin upon the Ground, and so remain for a\r\nWeek in hot Weather, the Sun and Dew will exhaust all its Juices, and\r\nleave it no more Virtue than is in Straw.\r\n\r\nTherefore ’tis best to keep as much of our Hay as we can from being\r\nexposed to the Dews, whilst ’tis in making; and we have a better\r\nOpportunity of doing it in this, than in natural Hay; because the\r\nbigger the Cocks are, the less Superficies (in proportion to the\r\nQuantity they contain) will be exposed to the Dew, and _St. Foin_ may\r\nbe safely made in much larger Cocks than natural Hay of equal Dryness\r\ncan, which, sinking down closer, excludes the Air so necessary for\r\nkeeping it sweet, that if the Weather prevents its being frequently\r\nmov’d and open’d, it will ferment, look yellow, and be spoil’d. Against\r\nthis Misfortune there is no Remedy, but to keep it in the lesser Cocks,\r\nuntil thoroughly dry. _St. Foin_ Cocks (twice as big as Cocks of\r\nnatural Hay), by the less Flexibility of the Stalk admitting the Air,\r\nwill remain longer without fermenting.\r\n\r\nThis being able to endure more Days unmov’d, is also an Advantage upon\r\nanother Account besides the Weather; for tho’ in other Countries,\r\nPeople are not prohibited using the necessary Labour on _all Days_ for\r\npreserving their Hay, even where the certainer Weather makes it less\r\nnecessary than here, yet ’tis otherwise in _England_; where many a\r\nThousand Load of natural Hay is spoil’d by that Prohibition for want\r\nof being open’d; and often, by the Loss of one Day’s Work, the Farmer\r\nloses his Charges, and Year’s Rent; which shews, that to make Hay while\r\nthe Sun shines, is an exotic Proverb against _English_ Laws; whereunto\r\n_St. Foin_ being, in regard of Sundays and Holidays, more conformable,\r\nought to be the Hay as proper to _England_ as those Laws are.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our Hay-makers: When the first Cocks have stood one\r\nNight, if nothing hinder, let them double, treble, or quadruple the\r\nCocks, according as all Circumstances require, in this manner; _viz._\r\nSpread Two, Three, or more, together, in a fresh Place; and after an\r\nHour or Two turn them, and make that Number up into one Cock; but when\r\nthe Weather is doubtful, let not the Cocks be thrown or spread, but\r\ninlarge them, by shaking several of them into one; and thus hollowing\r\nthem to let in the Air, continue increasing their Bulk, and diminishing\r\ntheir Number daily, until they be sufficiently dry to be carried to\r\nthe Rick.\r\n\r\nThis I have found the most secure Way: Tho’ it be something longer in\r\nmaking, there is much less Danger than when a great Quantity of Hay is\r\nspread at once; for then a sudden Shower will do more Harm to one Acre\r\nof that, than to Twenty Acres in Cock.\r\n\r\nAnd the very best Hay I ever knew in _England_, was of _St. Foin_ made\r\nwithout ever spreading, or the Sun’s shining on it. This Way, tho’ it\r\nbe longer ere finish’d, is done with less Labour than the other.\r\n\r\nNot only a little Rain, but even a Mist, will turn _Clover Hay_ black;\r\nbut _St. Foin_ will not with any Weather turn black, until it be almost\r\nrotten, its Leaves being thinner than those of _Clover_.\r\n\r\nIf _St. Foin_ be laid up pretty green, it will take no Damage, provided\r\nit be set in small round Ricks, with a large Basket drawn up in the\r\nMiddle of each, to leave a Vent-hole there, thro’ which the superfluous\r\nMoisture of the Hay transpires.\r\n\r\nAs soon as its Heating is over, these Ricks ought to be thatch’d; and\r\nall _St. Foin_ Ricks, that are made when the Hay is full dry’d in the\r\nCocks, ought to be thatch’d immediately after the making them.\r\n\r\nThat which is laid up most dry’d, will come out of the Rick of a green\r\nColour, that which has much heated in the Rick, will have a brown\r\nColour.\r\n\r\nThe Seed is a Fourth Chance the Owner has to make Profit of his _St.\r\nFoin_: But this, if the _Hoeing-Husbandry_ were general, would not be\r\nvendible in great Quantities for planting; because an ordinary Crop of\r\nan Acre will produce Seed enough to drill an Hundred Acres, which would\r\nnot want replanting in a long Time.\r\n\r\nThe other Use then of this Seed is for Provender; and it has been\r\naffirmed by some, who have made Trials of it, that Three Bushels of\r\ngood _St. Foin_ Seed given to Horses, will nourish them as much as\r\nFour Bushels of Oats. When well order’d, it is so _sweet_, that most\r\nSorts of Cattle are greedy of it. I never knew so much of it given to\r\nHogs, as to make them become fat Bacon; but I have known Hogs made very\r\ngood Pork with it, for an Experiment; and being valued at the Beginning\r\nof their feeding, and the Pork by the Score when the Hogs were kill’d,\r\nwhich, computed with the Quantity of Seed they eat, did not amount\r\nto near the Value of the same Seed sold for sowing; that being Three\r\nShillings _per_ Bushel, and the Profit made by giving it to the Hogs\r\nwas but Two Shillings a Bushel.\r\n\r\nThe Goodness of the Seed, and of the Hay out of which it is thresh’d,\r\ndepends very much upon the manner of ordering them.\r\n\r\nThis thresh’d Hay, when not damaged by wet Weather, has been found more\r\nnourishing to Horses than coarse Water-meadow Hay; and, when ’tis cut\r\nsmall by an Engine, is good Food for Cattle, and much better than Chaff\r\nof Corn.\r\n\r\nIt requires some Experience in it, to know the most proper Degree of\r\nRipeness, at which the seeded _St. Foin_ ought to be cut; for the Seed\r\nis never all ripe together; some Ears blossom before others; every Ear\r\nbegins blossoming at the lower Part of it, and so continues gradually\r\nto do upward for many Days; and before the Flower is gone off the Top,\r\nthe Bottom of the Ear has almost fill’d the Seeds that grow there; so\r\nthat if we should defer cutting until the top Seeds are quite ripe, the\r\nlower, which are the best, would shed, and be lost.\r\n\r\nThe best time to cut is, when the greatest Part of the Seed is well\r\nfill’d, the first-blown ripe, and the last blown beginning to be full.\r\n\r\nThe natural Colour of the Kernel, which is the real Seed, is grey or\r\nbluish when ripe; and the Husk, which contains the Seed is, when ripe,\r\nof a brownish Colour. Both Husk and Seed continue perfectly green for\r\nsome time after full-grown; and if you open the Husk, the Seed will\r\nappear exactly like a green Pea when gather’d to boil, and will, like\r\nthat, easily be split into Two Parts. Yet St. Foin Seed in this green\r\nPlight will ripen after Cutting, have as fine a Colour, and be as good\r\nin all Respects, as that which was ripe before Cutting: Some, for want\r\nof observing this, have suffer’d their Seed to stand so long, till it\r\nwas all ripe, and lost in Cutting.\r\n\r\nSt. Foin Seed should not be cut in the Heat of the Day, whilst the\r\nSun shines out: for then much, even of the unripe Seed, will shed in\r\nMowing: Therefore, in very hot Weather, the Mower should begin to\r\nwork very early in the Morning, or rather in the Night; and when they\r\nperceive the Seed to shatter, leave off, and rest till towards the\r\nEvening.\r\n\r\nAfter Cutting we must observe the same Rule as in mowing it; _viz._ not\r\nto make this Hay whilst the Sun shines.\r\n\r\nSometimes it may, if the Seed be pretty ripe, be cock’d immediately\r\nafter the Scythe; or if the Swarths must be turn’d, let it be\r\ndone whilst they are moist; not Two together, as in the other Hay\r\naforemention’d. If the Swarths be turn’d with the Rake’s Handle, ’tis\r\nbest to raise up the Ear-sides first, and let the Stub-side rest on\r\nthe Ground in turning; but if it be done by the Rake’s Teeth, then\r\nlet them take hold on the Stub-side, the Ears bearing on the Earth in\r\nturning over. But ’tis commonly Rain that occasions the Swarths to want\r\nTurning[185].\r\n\r\n  [185] If the Swarths be not very great, we never turn them at all,\r\n  because the Sun or Wind will quickly dry them.\r\n\r\nIf it be cock’d at all[186], the sooner ’tis made into Cocks, the\r\nbetter; because, if the Swarths be dry, much of the Seed will be lost\r\nin separating them, the Ears being entangled together. When moist, the\r\nSeed sticks fasts to the Ear; but, when dry, will drop out with the\r\nleast Touch or Shaking.\r\n\r\n  [186] Sometimes when we design to thresh in the Field, we make no\r\n  Cocks at all, and but only just separate the Swarths in the Dew\r\n  of the Morning dividing them into Parts of about Two Feet in each\r\n  Part. By this means the St. Foin is sooner dry’d, than when it lies\r\n  thicker, as it must do, if made into Cocks.\r\n\r\nThere are Two ways of threshing it, the one in the Field, the other\r\nin the Barn: The first cannot be done but in very fine Weather, and\r\nwhilst the Sun shines in the Heat of the Day: The best Manner of this\r\nis, to have a large Sheet pegg’d down to the Ground, for Two Men with\r\ntheir Flails to thresh on: Two Persons carry a small Sheet by its\r\nCorners, and lay it down close to a large Cock, and, with Two Sticks\r\nthrust under the Bottom of it, gently turn it over, or lift it up upon\r\nthe Sheet, and carry and throw it on the great Sheet to the Threshers;\r\nbut when the Cocks are small, they carry several at once, thrown upon\r\nthe little Sheet carefully with Forks; those which are near, they\r\ncarry to the Threshers with the Forks only. As fast as it is thresh’d,\r\none Person stands to take away the Hay, and lay it into an Heap: And\r\nsometimes a Boy stands upon it, to make it into a small Rick of about a\r\nLoad. As often as the great Sheet is full, they riddle it thro’ a large\r\nSieve to separate the Seed and Chaff from the broken Stalks, and put it\r\ninto Sacks to be carried into the Barn to be winnow’d.\r\n\r\nTwo Threshers will employ Two of these little Sheets, and Four Persons\r\nin bringing to them; and when the Cocks are thresh’d, which stand at a\r\nconsiderable Distance all round them, they remove the Threshing-sheet\r\nto another Place. There belong to a Set for one Threshing-sheet Seven\r\nor Eight Persons; but the Number of Sheets should be according to the\r\nQuantity to be thus thresh’d: The sooner these thresh’d Cocks are\r\nremov’d, and made into bigger Ricks, the better; and unless they be\r\nthatch’d, the Rain will run a great Way into them, and spoil the Hay;\r\nbut they may be thatch’d with the Hay itself, if there be not Straw\r\nconvenient for it.\r\n\r\nBut the chiefest Care yet remains; and that is, to cure the Seed: If\r\nthat be neglected, it will be of little or no Value[187]; and the\r\nbetter it has escap’d the Wet in the Field, the sooner its own Spirits\r\nwill spoil it in the Barn or Granary. I have known it lie a Fortnight\r\nin Swarth, till the wet Weather has turn’d the Husks quite black: This\r\nwas thresh’d in the Field, and immediately put into large Vessels,\r\nholding about Twenty Bushels each. It had by being often wet, and often\r\ndry, been so exhausted of its fiery Spirits, that it remain’d cool\r\nin the Vessels, without ever fermenting in the least, till the next\r\nSpring; and then it grew as well as ever any did that was planted.\r\n\r\n  [187] But there is yet another Care to be taken of St. Foin Seed,\r\n  besides the curing it; and that is, to keep it from Rats and Mice\r\n  after ’tis cured; or else, if their Number be large, they will in a\r\n  Winter eat up all the Seed of a considerable Quantity, leaving only\r\n  empty Husks, which to the Eye appear the same as when the Seeds are\r\n  in them. A Man cannot without Difficulty take a Seed out of its Husk;\r\n  but the Vermin are so dextrous at it, that they will eat the Seed\r\n  almost as fast out of the Husks, as if they were pulled out for them.\r\n  I saw a Rat killed as he was running from an Heap of it, that had\r\n  Seven peeled Seeds in his Mouth not swallowed; which is a Sign, that\r\n  he was not long in taking them out. They take them out so cleverly,\r\n  that the Hole in the Husk shuts itself up when the Seed is out of it.\r\n  But, if you feel the Husk between your Finger and Thumb, you will\r\n  find it empty. Also a Sackful of them is very light; yet there have\r\n  been some so ignorant and incurious as to sow such empty Husks for\r\n  several Years successively; and none coming up, they concluded their\r\n  Land to be improper for St. Foin.\r\n\r\nBut of Seed thresh’d in the Field, without ever being wetted, if it\r\nbe immediately winnow’d, and a single Bushel laid in an Heap, or put\r\ninto a Sack, it will in few Days ferment to such a Degree, that the\r\ngreatest Part of it will lose its vegetative Quality: The larger the\r\nHeap, the worse: During the Fermentation it will be very hot, and smell\r\nsour.\r\n\r\nMany, to prevent this, spread it upon a Malt-Floor, turning it often;\r\nor, when the Quantity is small, upon a Barn-floor; but still I find,\r\nthat this Way a great deal of it is spoil’d; for it will heat, tho’\r\nit be spread but an handful thick, and they never spread it thinner:\r\nBesides, they may miss some Hours of the right times of turning it;\r\nfor it must be done very often; it should be stirr’d in the Night as\r\nwell as the Day, until the Heating be over; and yet, do what they can,\r\nit never will keep its Colour so bright as that which is well housed,\r\nwell dry’d, and thresh’d in the Winter: For in the Barn the Stalks keep\r\nit hollow; there are few Ears or Seeds that touch one another; and the\r\nSpirits have room to fly off by Degrees, the Air entering to receive\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe only Way I have found to imitate and equal this, is to winnow it\r\nfrom the Sheet; then lay a Layer of Wheat-straw (or if that be wanting,\r\nof very dry-thresh’d Hay); then spread thereon a thin Layer of Seed,\r\nand thus _Stratum super Stratum_, Six or Seven Feet high, and as much\r\nin Breath; then begin another Stack; let there be Straw enough, and do\r\nnot tread on the Stacks; by this means the Seed mixing with the Straw,\r\nwill be kept cool, and come out in the Spring with as green a Colour as\r\nwhen it was put in, and not one Seed of a Thousand will fail to grow\r\nwhen planted. A little Barn-room will contain a great Quantity in this\r\nManner.\r\n\r\nI have had above One hundred Quarters of clean Seed thus manag’d in one\r\nBay of a small Barn. We do not stay to winnow it clean before we lay it\r\nup in the Straw; but only pass it through a large Sieve, and with the\r\nVan blow out the Chaff, and winnow it clean in the Spring.\r\n\r\nThis Field-threshing requires extraordinary fine Sun-shiny Weather,\r\nwhich some Summers do not afford at the Season, for threshing a great\r\nQuantity of it; for ’tis but a small Part of the Day in which the\r\nSeed can be thresh’d clean out. They who have a small Quantity of it,\r\ndo carry it into a Barn early in the Morning, or even in the Night;\r\nwhilst the Dew is on it; for then the Seed sticks fast to the Ear:\r\nAs it dries, they thresh it out; and if they cure it well, have thus\r\nsometimes good Seed, but generally the Hay is spoil’d.\r\n\r\nThere is one Method of saving all the Seed good, and the Hay too, by\r\ncarrying it unthresh’d to the Barn or Rick, in a particular Manner,\r\ntho’ it be a great Quantity, more than can presently be thresh’d; but\r\nmust be laid up in Mows or Ricks, as Corn is. Then if it be carry’d in,\r\nin the Dews or Damp, the Hay is sure to be spoil’d, if not both Hay and\r\nSeed: When ’tis taken up dry, the Seed comes out with a Touch, and the\r\ngreatest Part is lost in pitching up the Cocks, binding and jolting in\r\ncarrying home.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this Dilemma, a Person who happen’d to have a great Crop of\r\nSeed on One hundred and Fifty Acres together (and being by Weather\r\ndelay’d ’till Wheat-harvest came on, so that most Labourers went to\r\nReaping) was forc’d to a Contrivance of getting it in as follows;\r\n_viz._ Three Waggons had each a Board with an Hole in, fix’d cross the\r\nMiddle of each Waggon, by Iron Pins, to the Top of the Rades or Sides:\r\nThere was a Crane which a Man could lift, and set into the Hole in the\r\nBoard, and, having an Iron Gudgeon at the Bottom, which went into a\r\nSocket in the Bottom of the Waggon, would turn quite round: The Post of\r\nthe Crane was Ten Feet Four Inches long, its Arm Four Feet Eight Inches\r\nlong, brac’d; having a treble Pulley at the End of it, and another to\r\nanswer it with an Hook.\r\n\r\nAbout Forty Sheets were provided, capable of holding each One hundred\r\nand Fifty, or Two hundred Pounds Weight of it; these had Knots or\r\nButtons at the Corners and Middles, made by sewing up a little Hay\r\nin these Knots, as big as Apples, into Part of the Sheet; for if any\r\nBuckle, or other thing, be sew’d to a Sheet plain, it will tear the\r\nSheet. Half these Buttons have Strings ty’d to them; these Sheets\r\nare spread among the Cocks, fill’d by Two, and ty’d up by Two other\r\nPersons: There is also a light Fir Ladder, wide at Bottom, the Top of\r\nit fasten’d by a Piece of Cord to the brace of the Crane: they hitch\r\nthe Hook of the lower Pulley to a fill’d Sheet, and by a little Horse\r\nat the End of the Pulley-rope, draw it up sliding on the Ladder; ’tis\r\nup in a Moment: Then the Man who is below, hitches the Crook of the\r\nPulley to the lower Round of the Ladder, and the Loader above pulls up\r\nthe Ladder from the Ground, till the Waggon comes to another Sheet. The\r\nWaggons are lengthen’d by Cart-Ladders before and behind, for the more\r\neasy placing of the Sheets. When about Twelve or Fifteen of them are\r\nloaded, they have a Rope fix’d to the Fore-part of each Waggon, which\r\nthey bring over the Top of all the loaded Sheets, and wrest it at the\r\nTail, to hold on the Sheets fast from falling off with Jolting. Then\r\nthe Loader pulls out the Crane, and puts it into the next Waggon in the\r\nsame Manner. One Waggon is loading whilst another is emptying in the\r\nBarn, by treble Pulleys likewise; because ’tis inconvenient to take\r\nit out of the Sheets by Prongs; but the Pulleys will easily draw off\r\nTwo or Three Sheets together. One Waggon is always going to the Field,\r\nor coming home. This Contrivance makes more Expedition than one would\r\nimagine: Three Loads have been loaded, and sent off, in the same Time\r\nthis way, that one Load of Hay has been loading, binding, and raking\r\noff the Outsides of it, in the next Ground, in the common Way.\r\n\r\nI will not relate the manner of making a Rick of this Seed in its Hay,\r\nof monstrous Dimensions, by a sort of Mast-pole Forty-four Feet high,\r\nwith a Ten Feet Crane at the Top, which made the same Expedition;\r\nbecause I think, that where such a Quantity is, _Dutch_ Barns with\r\nmoving Roofs are better. Such a Rick is troublesome to thatch, and the\r\nWind has more Power to blow the Thatch off so high in the Air, than if\r\nit were lower. Neither would I advise any one to reserve much more St.\r\nFoin for Threshing, than his Barn will contain; because tho’ sometimes\r\nit brings the greatest Profit by Threshing, yet some Years ’tis apt to\r\nbe blighted.\r\n\r\nI have been told by my Neighbour, that he had a Crop of Five Quarters\r\nof St. Foin Seed on an Acre; but the most Profit that ever I took\r\nnotice of, was on half an Acre, which was drill’d very thin, and had\r\nno Crop of Corn with it; by which Advantage it produc’d a good Crop\r\nof Seed the next Year after it was planted, and the Third Year this\r\nHalf-Acre produc’d (as was try’d by a Wager) within a Trifle of Two\r\nQuarters of Seed, which was sold for Two Pounds and Ten Shillings:\r\nThe thresh’d Hay of it was sold in the Place for One Pound, and Two\r\nQuarters of Chaff sold for Twelve Shillings; in all Four Pounds and\r\nTwo Shillings. There was also a very good Aftermath, which was worth\r\nthe Charges of Cutting and Threshing: So that the clear Profit of\r\nthe One Year of this Half Acre of Ground amounted to Four Pounds Two\r\nShillings: And it was remarkable, that at the same Time the rest of the\r\nsame Field, being in all Ten Acres, had a Crop of Barley sown on Three\r\nPlowings, which (the Summer being dry) was offered to be sold at One\r\nPound _per_ Acre.\r\n\r\nI believe the greatest Part of the St. Foin that is sown, is spoil’d by\r\nbeing indiscreetly fed by Sheep[188]; which Damage is occasion’d merely\r\nby suffering them to continue feeding it too long at a Time, especially\r\nin the Spring; for then the Sap moves quick, and must be depurated by\r\nthe Leaves; and as the Sun’s nearer Approach accelerates the Motion or\r\nFerment of the Juices, more _Pabulum_ is receiv’d by the Roots; but for\r\nwant of Leaves to discharge the Recrements, and enliven the Sap with\r\nnitro-aereous Particles (the Sheep devouring the Buds continually as\r\nfast as they appear), the St. Foin’s vital Flame (if I may so call it)\r\nis extinguish’d; the Circulation ceasing, the Sap stagnates, and then\r\nit ends in Corruption[189]. But let the Sheep eat it never so low, in\r\na short time, without continuing thereon, or cropping the next Buds\r\nwhich succeed those they have eaten, the Plants will recover and grow\r\nagain as vigorously as ever, and if with a Spade, in the Winter you cut\r\noff the St. Foin Heads an Handful deep, and take them away, together\r\nwith their upper Earth, the Wound in the remaining Root will heal, and\r\nsend out more Heads as good as those cut off, if those second Heads be\r\npreserv’d from Cattle, until they attain to a Bigness competent to bear\r\nLeaves sufficient for the Use of the reviving Plants: Nay, I have seen\r\nPlants of St. Foin cut off in the Winter a Foot deep, and the Earth of\r\nthat Depth taken away; and the remaining Root recover’d, and grew to an\r\nextraordinary Bigness: But this was preserv’d from Cattle at first.\r\n\r\n  [188] I never suffer Sheep to come upon St. Foin, except betwixt\r\n  Mowing-time and _All-Saints_. And there is so much Danger of spoiling\r\n  St. Foin by the Fraud of Shepherds, that I knew a Gentleman that\r\n  bound his Tenant never to suffer any Sheep to come thereon; and by\r\n  this means his St. Foin continued in Perfection much longer than is\r\n  usual, where St. Foin is suffer’d to be fed by Sheep.\r\n\r\n  [189] Natural Grass is not kill’d by constant feeding, because no\r\n  sort of Cattle can bite it so low as to deprive it of all its Leaves;\r\n  and ’tis, like Eels, more tenacious of Life than the rest of its\r\n  Genius, and will send out Leaves from the very Roots when reversed,\r\n  as is too often seen where turffy Land is plow’d up in large Furrows.\r\n\r\nI esteem St. Foin to be much more profitable than Clover, because St.\r\nFoin is never known to do any perceivable Damage to the Corn amongst\r\nwhich ’tis planted; but Clover often spoils a Crop of Barley[190]; and\r\nI have known, that the Crop of Barley has been valued to have suffer’d\r\nFour Pounds _per_ Acre Damage by a Crop of broad Clover’s growing in it\r\nin a wet Summer: In a dry Summer both Sorts of Clover are apt to miss\r\ngrowing; and if it does grow, and the next Summer (wherein it ought\r\nto be a Crop) prove very dry, it fails on most sorts of Land, tho’ it\r\nwas vigorous enough to spoil the Barley the Year it was sown; at best,\r\n’tis of but very short Duration, and therefore is not to be depended\r\non by the Farmer, for maintaining his Cattle, which the broad Clover\r\nwill also kill, sometimes by causing them to swell, unless great Care\r\nbe taken to prevent it. The broad Clover is esteem’d a foul Feed for\r\nHorses. The Hop Clover is gone out of the Ground sooner than the broad\r\nClover; I never knew it cut more than once: Indeed Cattle are never\r\nswollen by feeding on it; but then it affords but very little Feeding\r\nfor them, except the Land whereon it grows be very rich.\r\n\r\n  [190] But this Damage may be prevented by drilling the Clover after\r\n  the Barley is an Handful high or more; for then the Barley will keep\r\n  it under, and not suffer it to grow to any considerable Bigness till\r\n  after Harvest; nor will this Drill, being drawn by Hand, do any\r\n  Damage to the Barley.\r\n\r\nSt. Foin is observ’d to enrich whatever Ground ’tis planted on, tho’ a\r\nCrop be taken off it yearly.\r\n\r\nPoor Slate Land[191], when it has borne sown St. Foin for Six or Seven\r\nYears, being plow’d up, and well till’d, produces Three Crops of Corn;\r\nand then they sow it with St. Foin again.\r\n\r\n  [191] The Poverty of this sort of Land, lying upon Slate or Stone,\r\n  generally proceeds from the Thinness of it; and, if it were thicker,\r\n  it would be good Land: Much of this Earth, being dispersed among the\r\n  Crannies or Interstices of the Slate and Stone to a great Depth, is\r\n  reach’d by the Tap-roots of the St. Foin, but cannot be reach’d by\r\n  the Roots of Corn; and therefore, when constantly kept in Tillage, is\r\n  of small Value: Upon which Account such Land is greatly improveable\r\n  by St. Foin, even when sown in the common manner.\r\n\r\nRich arable Land was planted with it, and mow’d annually with very\r\ngreat Crops (’twas drill’d in Nine-inch Rows, with Six Gallons of Seed\r\nto an Acre; One Crop of it was sold at Four Pounds _per_ Acre): This,\r\nafter about Seven Years, and in full Perfection, was plow’d up by a\r\nTenant, and continued for many Years after so rich, that, instead of\r\ndunging or fallowing it for Wheat, they were forc’d to sow that upon\r\nBarley-stubble, and to feed the Wheat with Sheep in the Spring, to\r\nprevent its being too luxuriant.\r\n\r\nBut ’tis to be noted, that the Land must be well till’d at the breaking\r\nup of old St. Foin, or else the First Crops of Corn may be expected to\r\nfail: For I knew a Tenant, who, the last Year of his Term, plow’d up\r\na Field of St. Foin, that would have yielded him Three Pounds _per_\r\nAcre; but, thinking to make more Profit of it by Corn, he sow’d it with\r\nWhite Oats upon once Plowing; and it proving a dry Summer, he lost his\r\nPlowing and Seed; for he had no Crop of Oats, and was forc’d to leave\r\nthe Land as a Fallow to his Successor.\r\n\r\nMany more Instances there are of this Failure of the Crop of Corn after\r\nSt. Foin has been broken up, and not well till’d.\r\n\r\nWhen St. Foin is grown old, and worn out, as ’tis said to be when\r\nthe artificial Pasture is gone, and the natural Pasture is become\r\ninsufficient for the Number of Plants that are on it, to be maintained;\r\nand is so poor, that it produces no profitable Crop, so that the Ground\r\nis thought proper to be plow’d up, and sown with Corn, in order to be\r\nreplanted[192]; the most effectual Way to bring it into Tilth speedily,\r\nis, to plow it up in the Winter, with a Four-coulterd Plough, and make\r\nit fit for Turneps by the following Season; and if the Turneps be well\r\nho’d, and especially if spent by Sheep on the Ground, ’twill be in\r\nexcellent Order to be sown with Barley the following Spring; and then\r\nit may be drill’d with St. Foin amongst the Barley.\r\n\r\n  [192] Or if you perceive, that there is a competent Number of Plants\r\n  alive, and tolerably single; be they never so poor, you may recover\r\n  them to a flourishing Condition in the following manner, without\r\n  replanting: Pulverize the whole Field in Intervals of about Three\r\n  Feet each, leaving betwixt every Two of them Four Feet Breadth of\r\n  Ground unplow’d. When the Turf of these Intervals, being cut by the\r\n  Four coulter’d Plough, is perfectly rotten, one Furrow made by any\r\n  sort of Plough will hoe one of these Intervals, by changing the whole\r\n  Surface of it. The poorer the Land is, the more Hoeings will be\r\n  required; and the oftener ’tis ho’d, with proper Intermissions the\r\n  first Year, the stronger the St. Foin will become, and the more Years\r\n  it will continue good, without a Repetition of Hoeing.\r\n\r\n  The Expence of this cannot be great; because the Plough, in hoeing an\r\n  Acre in this manner Nine Times, travels no farther than it must to\r\n  plow an Acre once in the common Manner.\r\n\r\n  I need not tell the Owner, that the Earth of these Intervals must be\r\n  made level, before the St. Foin can be mowed.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Benefit Land receives by having been planted some\r\nYears with St. Foin: All the Experienc’d know, that Land is enriched by\r\nit; but they do not agree upon the Reason why.\r\n\r\nThey agree as to the Οτι, but not the Διοτι.\r\n\r\nSome are of Opinion, ’tis because the St. Foin takes a different Sort\r\nof Nourishment to that of Corn: But that I think is disprov’d in the\r\nChapter of _Change of Species_, where ’tis shewn, that all Plants in\r\nthe same Soil must take the same Food.\r\n\r\nMr. _Kirkham_ thinks St. Foin has no collateral or horizontal Roots\r\nin the upper Part of the Ground where the Plough tills for Corn; and\r\ntherefore has no Nourishment from that Part of the Soil which feeds the\r\nCorn. This would be a very good Account for it, were it not utterly\r\ncontrary to Matter of Fact, as every one may see.\r\n\r\nBut so far it is right, that large[193] St. Foin draws the greatest\r\nPart of its Nourishment from below the Reach of the Plough; and what\r\nPart it does receive from the Staple is overbalanc’d by the Second\r\nCrop, or After-lease, being spent by Cattle on the Ground; different\r\nfrom Corn, which is very near wholly maintain’d by the plow’d Part of\r\nthe Earth, and is all carry’d off.\r\n\r\n  [193] For large St. Foin, being single, has large Roots, and very\r\n  long, which probably descend Twenty Feet deep: Now, if we allow Four\r\n  or Five Inches the Depth of the Staple, to afford a Supply equal\r\n  to Two Feet below it, taking the lower Nineteen Feet Seven Inches\r\n  together, upon this Computation, the Part below the Staple gives the\r\n  St. Foin about Nine Parts in Ten of its Sustenance.\r\n\r\nFor tho’ the under _Stratum_ of Earth be much poorer than the upper;\r\nyet that, never having been drain’d by any sort of Vegetables, must\r\nafford considerable Nourishment to the First that comes there.\r\n\r\nAnd besides, in such Land whose Poverty proceeds from the Rain’s\r\ncarrying its Riches too quickly down through the upper _Stratum_, the\r\nunder _Stratum_ must be the richer[194] for receiving what the upper\r\n_Stratum_ lets pass unarrested.\r\n\r\n  [194] In light poor Land the Water carrying some impregnated Earth\r\n  along with it down lower than it does in strong Land, that is more\r\n  tenacious of such impregnated Particles, the under _Strata_ of strong\r\n  Land are likely to be poorer than those of light Land.\r\n\r\n’Tis well known, that many Estates have been much improv’d by St. Foin;\r\ntherefore there is no occasion to mention Particulars. Only I will take\r\nNotice, that the First in _England_ was one of about One hundred and\r\nForty Pounds _per Annum_, sown with St. Foin, and sold for Fourteen\r\nThousand Pounds; and as I hear, continues, by the same Improvement,\r\nstill of the same Value. This is, I suppose, the same that Mr.\r\n_Kirkham_ mentions in _Oxfordshire_.\r\n\r\nAnother Farm of Ten Pounds _per Annum_ Rent, which, whilst in\r\nArable[195], was like to have undone the Tenant; but being all planted\r\nwith St. Foin by the Owner, was lett at One hundred and Ten Pounds _per\r\nAnnum_, and prov’d a good Bargain.\r\n\r\n  [195] These Estates consisted of thin Slate Land; which before it was\r\n  planted with St. Foin, was valued at two Shillings _per_ Acre, and\r\n  some Part of it at One Shilling _per_ Acre (as I have been inform’d);\r\n  and yet Oxen are well fatted by the St. Foin it produces.\r\n\r\nIf it should be ask’d, Why St. Foin is an Improvement so much greater\r\nin _England_, than in other Countries? it might be answer’d by\r\nshewing the Reason why _English_ Arable is of so much less Value than\r\nForeign[196] where the Land is of equal Goodness, and the Corn produc’d\r\nof equal Price.\r\n\r\n  [196] ’Tis doubtless from the extraordinary Price of _English_ Labour\r\n  above that of other Countries, occasioned by _English_ Statutes being\r\n  in this Respect different from all other Laws in the World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of_ LUSERNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_La Luserne_ is that famous _Herba Medica_ so much extoll’d by the\r\nAntients.\r\n\r\nThe high Esteem they had of its Use appears by the extraordinary Pains\r\nthey bestow’d on its Culture.\r\n\r\nIts Leaves resemble those of Trefoil: It bears a blue Blossom very\r\nlike to double Violets, leaving a Pod like a Screw, which contains the\r\nSeeds about the Bigness of broad Clover, tho’ longer, and more of the\r\nKidney-shape.\r\n\r\nThe Stalks grow more perpendicular than any of the other artificial\r\nGrasses that I know, slender, full of Knots and Leaves: ’Tis of very\r\nnear an equal Bigness from Bottom to Top: When cut, if vigorous, the\r\nStalks will spring out again from the Stubs, immediately below where\r\nthe Scythe parted them; which makes them the sooner ready for another\r\nMowing; an Advantage which no other Grass has.\r\n\r\nIt has a Tap-root that penetrates deeper into the Bowels of the Earth,\r\nthan any other Vegetable she produces.\r\n\r\nTho’ one Luserne-root be much more taper than another towards the upper\r\nPart of it, ’tis sometimes seen, that a single ho’d Plant of it has\r\nmany of these perpendicular Roots, some of them springing out from the\r\nvery Branches of its Crown.\r\n\r\nIts Roots are abundantly longer than the Roots of St. Foin: I have One\r\nthat measures very near Two Inches Diameter: Those which are higher\r\nthan the Ground have a Bark like a Tree. Upon this account, and by its\r\nStalks springing again just below the Place where cut off, and by the\r\nwoody Hardness of its Stalks, when they stand too long without cutting,\r\nit seems that Luserne is of a Nature nearly approaching to that of a\r\nShrub.\r\n\r\nLuserne is the only Hay in the World that can pretend to excel or equal\r\nSt. Foin. I have known Instances of the pinguefying Virtue of this\r\n_Medica Hay_, that come up to the highest Encomiums given it by the\r\n_Romans_; which being to the Vulgar incredible, I forbear to relate,\r\nbut leave to be confirm’d by the Experience of others, when it becomes\r\nfrequent in _England_.\r\n\r\nLuserne in Grass is much sweeter than St. Foin, or any other artificial\r\nor natural Grass. This, when ho’d, may be given to Cattle cut green,\r\nfor Six Months; but then Care must be taken to[197] prevent their\r\nSwelling by its Lusciousness, and not to give them too much at once,\r\nuntil they be accustom’d to it.\r\n\r\n  [197] The Swelling of Cattle by eating too much green Luserne,\r\n  Clover, or Turnep-leaves, happens only to such as chew the Cud,\r\n  because they swallow more in less Time than other Cattle do; and a\r\n  large Quantity of such luscious Greens being swallow’d by a Beast,\r\n  fermenting to a great Degree, heats and rarifies the internal Air,\r\n  which by its Spring becoming too strong for that Column of the\r\n  Atmosphere that enters at the Trachea, it presses the Lungs against\r\n  the Thorax so closely, that the Weight of the external Column is not\r\n  of Force to open their Vesicles, and then the Circulation of the\r\n  Blood is stopt, and the Beast is strangled.\r\n\r\n  Most Farmers know how to prevent the Swelling, so that now-a-days it\r\n  seldom happens; but when it does, there is an effectual way of curing\r\n  it, if taken in Time: They cut a Hole into the Maw near the Back in\r\n  a proper manner, whereat the rarified Air rushes out, and the Lungs\r\n  again perform their Action of Respiration.\r\n\r\nThe Quantities of Luserne Seed annually imported, and sown without\r\nSuccess, not discouraging People from continuing its Importation, shews\r\nthere is more need of a successful Way of Planting, than recommending\r\nit in _England_.\r\n\r\nI shall take Notice of some of the Reasons why I conclude there is no\r\nHope of making any Improvement by planting it in _England_, in any\r\nmanner practis’d by the Antients or Moderns.\r\n\r\nI wonder how any one should attempt to plant it here, who has seen in\r\n_Columella_, and other Authors, the Description of the manner the old\r\n_Romans_ planted it in. They chose out the very best Land, that was\r\nboth _pinguis_ and _putris_; they dung’d and till’d it to the greatest\r\nPerfection, and laid it out in Beds, as we do for Onions or Asparagus;\r\nthey sow’d it very thick, for that miserable Reason of enabling it by\r\nits Thickness the better to kill the Grass. The Beds being harrow’d\r\nvery fine before Sowing, which was in the End of _April_; the Seed\r\nrequired to be speedily cover’d, lest the Sun’s Heat should spoil it.\r\nBut with what Instrument must it be cover’d? For, after Sowing, the\r\nPlace must not be touch’d with Iron. _At medica obruitur non aratro,\r\nsed ligneis rastellis._ ‘_Medica_-feed is cover’d, not with the Plough,\r\nbut with little (or rather light) wooden Harrows.’ Two Days Work (of a\r\nTeam) were spent on this Harrowing of one Acre. Some time after it came\r\nup, they scratch’d it again and again with the same wooden Instruments:\r\nThis was call’d Sarrition: Then by Runcation they weeded it over and\r\nover, _Ne alterius generis herba invalidam medicam perimat._ ‘Lest\r\nother Grass should kill it whilst it was weak.’ The First Crop they let\r\nstand till some of the Seed shatter’d, to fill the Ground yet fuller of\r\nPlants: After that they might cut it as young as they pleas’d; but must\r\nbe sure to water it often after cutting. Then after a few Days, when it\r\nbegan to spring, they repeated their Runcation: and so continuing to\r\nweed out all manner of Grass for the First Two or Three Years, it used\r\nto bring Four or Six Crops a Year, and last Ten Years.\r\n\r\n_English_ Gardeners make Forty Pounds of an Acre of Asparagus, or\r\nCabbage-plants, with half the Labour and Expence that was bestow’d on\r\nan Acre of _Roman Medica_.\r\n\r\nWe know not the Price Hay and Grass were at in _Italy_, while the\r\n_Roman Empire_ was in its Glory, and _Rome_, then the Metropolis of the\r\nWorld, drew the Riches of all Parts thither; its Price must be then\r\nvery high.\r\n\r\nAnd the _Romans_ had not only Servants, but plenty of Slaves, for whom\r\nthey had scarce sufficient Employment: This might lessen the Expence\r\nof this tedious Method of Planting, and ordering the _Medica_. But\r\nwhen the _Romans_ were brought down to the Level of other Nations,\r\nand in Danger of being Slaves, instead of having them; and the Lands\r\nof _Italy_ came to be cultivated by _Italian_ Hands only; they found\r\nsomething else more necessary to employ them in, than the Sarritions,\r\nRuncations, and Rigations of the _Medica_. Their Labour being bestow’d\r\nin getting Bread for themselves, they substituted other artificial\r\nGrasses of more easy Culture, in the room of Medica, for the Food\r\nof their Cattle. They were so bigotted to all the Superstitions of\r\ntheir Ancestors, that they were content to lose the Use of that most\r\nbeneficial Plant, rather than attempt to cultivate it by a new, tho’\r\nmore rational Method, when they were become unable any longer to\r\ncontinue it by the old.\r\n\r\nThus, as I take it, Superstition has chased _Medica_ from the _Roman_\r\nTerritories, and so little of it is planted there, that beyond the\r\n_Alps_ I could not find one whole Acre of it.\r\n\r\nLuserne makes a great Improvement in the South of _France_: There,\r\nwhen their low sandy Land is well prepar’d, and very clean, they sow\r\nit alone, in _March_, and at _Michaelmas_, as we do Clover: Their\r\nsowing it at those Seasons is of a double Advantage: First, it saves\r\nthe Labour of watering it, which would be impracticable for so many\r\nthousand Acres, as there are planted. Secondly, Those Seasons being\r\nmuch moister than that wherein the _Romans_ sow’d it, the Grub has\r\nOpportunity of eating more of it at its first coming up; and often\r\nthe Frost kills some of it. By these Advantages the Ground is less\r\nover-stock’d.\r\n\r\nThe Summers there are much drier than in _Italy_, so that the Sun\r\nscorches up the natural Grass, and suffers it not to come to a Turf\r\ntill after some Years; and therefore has less need of Weeding.\r\n\r\nBut as that natural Grass increases, the Crops of Luserne are\r\nproportionably diminish’d: And tho’ Luserne is said to last Ten or\r\nTwelve Years; yet it is in Perfection only for a very few Years.\r\nWhilst it is at best on their richest Land, and in a kind Summer,\r\nthey have at Seven Crops Ten Tuns to an Acre, as I have computed them\r\nfrom the Relation of some of the Inhabitants of _Pezenas_. This was\r\nextraordinary: for I observ’d, that most of their common Crops made a\r\nvery thin Swarth.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ground begins to be turffy and hard, many of the\r\nLuserne-plants die, and the rest send up very few Stalks: The People\r\nknow this is the Destruction of it, and therefore I have seen some of\r\nthem, in that Case, half-plow it, thinking thereby to destroy the Turf:\r\nThis does for a time much strengthen the Luserne-plants; but it so\r\nmuch strengthens the Grass also, that the Turf grows the stronger; and\r\nthen there is no Remedy but to plow it up, make the Ground clean, and\r\nreplant it.\r\n\r\nIn more Northern Climates, where it rains oftener, the Ground sooner\r\nbecomes hard; and in the Land otherwise most proper for Luserne,\r\nthe Grass grows infinitely faster, and will be as strong a Turf in\r\nTwo Years, as in the hot Countries in Ten. Upon this Account, about\r\n_Paris_, even near the Walls, they plow up Luserne, and sow St. Foin in\r\nits room, because that endures Grass and hard Ground better, tho’ it\r\nbrings but One Crop a Year, or Two at most.\r\n\r\nAnd in many Places in _Franche Comtè_ and _Switzerland_, I have seen\r\nLuserne in the Corners of Vineyards, not above Two or Three Perches\r\ntogether, which they will at any Expence have to cure their Horses when\r\nsick; since they cannot obtain, by their Culture, Quantities sufficient\r\nto maintain them as their ordinary Food, there being too much Rain, and\r\ntoo little of the Sun’s violent Heat, to prevent the speedy Increase\r\nof Grass amongst it.\r\n\r\nHow then can we expect Success in sowing it in _England_, where Rains\r\nare yet more frequent, and the Sun is weaker? ’Tis not One Year in Ten,\r\nthat the natural Grass is here scorch’d up. In our rich Land the Grass\r\ncomes to a Turf very soon, and poor Land will not by the common Sowing\r\nbring Luserne to any Perfection, tho’ no Grass should annoy it.\r\n\r\nI have here seen Part of a Meadow Breast-plow’d, and, when the Turf\r\nwas dead, dug up and planted as a Garden: After it had been drill’d\r\nwith Carrots, ho’d, and made, in all Appearance, perfectly clean, it\r\nwas sown with Luserne, which came up and flourish’d very well the\r\nFirst Year, and indifferently the Second; but, after that, the Grass\r\ncame, and the Luserne grew faint; and in Three or Four Years time\r\nthere was no more left, but just to shew by here-and-there a single\r\npoor Stalk, that there had been Luserne sown, except one Plant of it,\r\nwhich was cleansed of Grass the Third Year; and this recover’d, and\r\nsent up Abundance of Stalks for Two Years after it; and then the Grass\r\nreturning, that Plant dwindled again.\r\n\r\nI have often try’d it in the richest Part of my Garden, and constantly\r\nfind, that, however vigorously it grows at the first, yet it soon\r\ndeclines, when the Grass appears amongst it, which is always the\r\nsooner, by how much the Soil (in _England_) is richer, unless the Spade\r\nor Hoe prevent it.\r\n\r\nHere have been also many Fields of a poorer whiteish Soil sown with it,\r\nwhich are not very subject to be over-run with Grass, as the rich Land\r\nis; and tho’ these were so well till’d as scarce any Grass appear’d,\r\nduring the many Years the Luserne liv’d therein, yet it never grew to\r\nany Perfection here neither; nor was there any one Crop worth much more\r\nthan the Cutting, it was always so poor, thin, and short. And, by what\r\nIntelligence I can get, all Experience proves, that every Soil in this\r\nIsland is too rich, too poor, or too cold, for the Luserne Improvement\r\nby the common Husbandry.\r\n\r\nI believe every one will be confirmed in this, who shall upon full\r\nInquiry find, that, amongst the great Quantities which have been sown\r\nin this Kingdom in that manner, never any of it was known to continue\r\ngood and flourishing Three Years; and that, on the contrary, never any\r\none Plant of it in any warm Soil, cultivated by the Hoeing manner, was\r\nknown to fail here, or in any other Country, as long as the Hoeing (or\r\nDigging about it, which is equivalent) was continued to it with proper\r\nRepetitions.\r\n\r\nA Multitude of such hoed Plants have I known, and are now to be\r\nseen in both poor and rich Lands: Therefore it seems possible, that\r\nThousands of _English_ Acres may be capable, by the Hoeing Culture,\r\nto produce Crops of Luserne every Year for an Age. For as the greater\r\nMoisture, and less intense Heat of this Climate, are, upon the Accounts\r\nmentioned, injurious to Luserne, yet this is only to such as is sown\r\nand cultivated in the common Manner, because our Climate, upon the very\r\nsame Accounts, is very advantageous to hoed Luserne.\r\n\r\nIn hot Countries, when the Summer is drier than ordinary, the Sun\r\nso scorches it, that they have fewer and much poorer Crops, than in\r\nmoister Summers; _viz._ only Four or Five, instead of Six or Seven;\r\nbut, in the driest Summer I ever knew in _England_, hoed Luserne\r\nyielded the most Crops.\r\n\r\nOur Summer Days are longer, have more of the Sun’s Warmth, and less of\r\nhis fiery Heat; he cherishes, but never burns Luserne, or any other\r\nhoed long Tap-rooted Plant in _England_.\r\n\r\nThe well hoed Earth, being open, receives and retains the Dews; the\r\nbenign solar Influence is sufficient to put them in Motion, but not\r\nto exhale them from thence. The Hoe prevents the Turf, which would\r\notherwise by its Blades or Roots intercept, and return back the Dews\r\ninto the Atmosphere, with the Assistance of a moderate Heat. So that\r\nthis Husbandry secures Luserne from the Injury of a wet Summer, and\r\nalso causes the Rain-water to sink down more speedily, and disperse\r\nits Riches all the Way of its Passage; otherwise the Water would be\r\nmore apt to stand on the Surface, chill the Earth, and keep off the Sun\r\nand Air from drying it: For, when the Surface is dry and open, Luserne\r\nwill bear a very great Degree of Heat, or grow with a mean one. I have\r\nseen this hoed Luserne, in a sheltry Place of my Garden, so much grown\r\nin a mild Winter, as to be measured Fourteen Inches and an half high\r\nat _Christmas_; and a very large single Plant of it, which had not\r\nbeen hoed for Two Years before, was laid bare by digging out the Earth\r\nall around it a Foot deep, to observe the Manner of its Tap-root; and\r\nthen the Earth was thrown in again, and the Hole filled up. This was\r\non the Twenty-seventh of _September_. Upon this mellowing of the Soil\r\nabout it, it sent out more Stalks in _October_, than it had done in\r\nthe whole Summer before; they grew very vigorously, until a great Snow\r\nfell in _December_, which also preserved the Verdure of them, till that\r\nwas melted away, and a black Frost came after it, and killed those\r\nStalks. It is probable this Plant sent out immediately new fibrous\r\nhorizontal Roots, which did grow apace to extract the Nourishment from\r\nthis new-made Pasture, in proportion to the quick Growth of the Stalks,\r\nwhich in Summer have been measured, and found to grow in Height Three\r\nInches and an half in a Night and a Day; this being almost One Inch in\r\nSix Hours.\r\n\r\nAnd it has been my Observation, that this Plant, in hot and cold\r\nCountries, thrives both with a much greater, or less Degree of Heat and\r\nMoisture, when it is hoed; for if it has Plenty of Nourishment, which\r\nHoeing always gives it, a very little Heat above, and the Moisture\r\nalone (which is never wanting to the deep Tap-root) suffice, and that\r\nPlenty of Food enables it the better to endure the Extremes of either\r\nHeat or Cold.\r\n\r\nWe need not much apprehend the Danger of _English_ Winters; for Luserne\r\nwill endure those which are more rigorous. In the Principality of\r\n_Neufchâtel_ the Winters are so severe, as to kill all the Rosemary\r\nleft abroad; yet Luserne survives them there: This proves it more hardy\r\nthan Rosemary, which is planted for Hedges in _England_; and here is\r\nscarce twice in an Age a Frost able to kill it.\r\n\r\nI have one single Luserne-plant in a poor Arable Field, that has stood\r\nthe Test of Two-and-twenty Winters, besides the Feeding of Sheep at all\r\nSeasons, and yet remains as strong as ever. What Quantity of Hay this\r\nPlant yearly produces, cannot be known, because at those times that\r\nCattle are kept from it, the Hares constantly crop it, being sweeter\r\nthan any other Grass.\r\n\r\nBut this happens to be fortunately situate, where ’tis not altogether\r\ndestitute of the Benefit of Hoeing. ’Tis in an Angle, where, every\r\ntime the Field is till’d, the Plough goes over it in turning from the\r\nFurrows of one Land and one Head-land; but it is after the Plough\r\nis lifted out of the Ground, and turned up on one side, so that the\r\nShare only breaks the Turf very small all around it, without plowing\r\nup the Plant: Yet it has escaped it so narrowly, that the Fin of the\r\nPlough-share has split it into Four Parts; Three of which remain, and\r\ngrow never the worse, but the Fourth is torn off, and the Wound healed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBy the extreme hard Winter that happened about the Year 1708, or\r\n1709, some of the Luserne in _Languedoc_ was killed: Yet this was no\r\nArgument of its Tenderness, but rather the contrary; because then all\r\nthe Olive-trees and Walnut-trees were there killed, tho’ the greatest\r\nPart of the Luserne escaped unhurt: And I did not hear one Walnut-tree\r\nwas killed that Winter in _England_. Perhaps those in _France_, having\r\nbeing accustomed to much hotter Summers, were unable to endure the\r\nRigour of the same Winter, that could do no Harm to the same Species in\r\n_England_, where our Winters do not seem to exceed some of theirs in\r\nCold, so much as their Summers do ours in Heat. And since the Extremes\r\nare not so far asunder here, the same Degree of Cold may to our Plants\r\nseem tepid, which to those in _Languedoc_ must seem rigorous, differing\r\na more remote Degree from the opposite Extremity of Heat in Summer.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides the Difference of Heat and Cold in different Climates,\r\nthere is another more necessary to be observed; and that is, the\r\nDifference of the Hardiness in different Individuals of the same\r\nSpecies: The same Frost that kills a faint languishing Plant of\r\nLuserne, will be despised by a robust one, which, being well fed by\r\nthe Hoe, becomes a Giant cloath’d and fenced with a thick Bark, that\r\nrenders it impregnable against all Weather; its Rind is to it a Coat of\r\nMail or Buff, impenetrable by Frost: But the unhoed is generally small\r\nand weak; its thin tender Bark exposes it almost naked to the Frost; it\r\nbeing, for want of a sufficient Pasture, starv’d and half-dead already,\r\n’tis the more easily killed by the Cold.\r\n\r\nI formerly lived some Years in _Languedoc_, where are many Hundred\r\nAcres of Luserne; and I never could find a very large Plant amongst\r\nit, unless in such Pieces as had been plowed up, tilled, and sown with\r\nCorn: Here indeed those Plants that remained (as always some would do)\r\ngrew to an extraordinary Bulk; and One of those single tilled Plants\r\ndid seem to produce a greater Quantity of Stalks, than Twenty of such\r\nas had not been plowed up; and as there were no large Plants amongst\r\nthe unplowed, so there were no small amongst the plowed ones. The same\r\nthing has been observed in all other Places where Luserne has been\r\nplowed[198].\r\n\r\n  [198] This Plowing is a Hoeing to the Luserne.\r\n\r\nAnd in _Wiltshire_ several Grounds of it stood some Years without ever\r\ncoming to a Substance to be of any Value, tho’ the Land was whitish,\r\nand scarce any Grass appeared amongst the Luserne; and therefore its\r\nPoorness was thought to proceed from the Soil’s being improper; but\r\nwhen it had been broken up, and sown several Years with Corn, and\r\nafterwards lain down with St. Foin, all the Luserne-plants which\r\nremained (and they were many) grew large and strong, shooting up a\r\nYard in Height soon after the St. Foin was cut; and if there had been\r\na competent Number of them undestroyed by the Plough, they would have\r\nyielded Crops of an extraordinary Value, where before Plowing it grew\r\nbut few Inches above the Ground.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in this sort of Land the Earth grows stale, ere the\r\nLuserne arrives at a Tenth Part of its Stature: But this is most\r\nremarkable, that Tillage transforms those Luserne-plants from Dwarfs\r\nto Giants; and then they are able to contend with, if not conquer, so\r\nstrong Plants as St. Foin is, tho’ before Plowing they were unable to\r\nresist the Depredations of a few hairy Spires of Grass.\r\n\r\nSince Tillage can thus recover Luserne, after it has long languished in\r\nthe lowest Ebb of Life, and restore it to Health, Youth, and Vigour,\r\nand augment its Stature even after it has passed the Age of its full\r\nGrowth; to what Bulk would it arrive, regularly planted, and hoed from\r\nits Infancy to Maturity without any Check to stint it!\r\n\r\nWe can never know how poor a Soil will bear this Plant, unless it be\r\ntried by the Hoeing Culture.\r\n\r\nFor ’tis wondrous how so great a Man as Dr. _Woodward_ should\r\nimagine, that Difference of Soil should be the Reason why Apples in\r\n_Herefordshire_, and Cherries in _Kent_, succeed better than in other\r\nPlaces, when in truth they are seen to prosper as well almost all over\r\n_England_, where planted, cultivated, and preserved.\r\n\r\nI believe Plants are more altered as to their Growth, by being\r\ncultivated or not, than by Change of Climates differing in very many\r\nDegrees of Latitude. I say, in their Growth, not always in their Fruit;\r\nfor tho’ a Peach-tree, well cultivated in a Standard, will grow here\r\nvigorously, and be very beautiful; yet its Fruit will be of little\r\nValue, unless it be planted against a good Wall: So Luserne, unless\r\ncultivated upon a well exposed Gravel, will yield little Seed in\r\n_England_.\r\n\r\nThe Soil to plant it on is either an hot Gravel, a very rich dry Sand,\r\nor some other rich warm Land, that has not an under _Stratum_ of Clay,\r\nnor is too near the Springs of Water; for, if the Earth below be of a\r\ncold Nature, which I take to be occasioned by its holding of Water,\r\nthe Luserne will not long prosper therein, of whatever Sort the upper\r\n_Stratum_ of Earth may be: This may be guessed at by the Vegetables a\r\nSoil naturally produces, as Fern, and the like; which, Mr. _Evelyn_\r\nobserves, do indicate a Soil subject to Extremities of Heat and Cold;\r\nand condemns such a Soil as accursed. I agree to that Sentence, as\r\nfar as relates to Cold; but am not satisfied of its abounding with\r\nHeat; and I am sure I know some Land very subject to Fern, which is\r\nvery far from being barren, when well cultivated, and well suited with\r\nVegetables; but, from among these, Luserne must be excluded.\r\n\r\nLuserne in hot Countries grows best near Rivers, where its Roots reach\r\nthe Water, which helps to mitigate the excessive Heat of the Climate;\r\nbut here the Heats are so moderate, that if Luserne-roots are in Water\r\n(for ’tis that that makes Earth cold) it diminishes too much the just\r\nProportion of Heat, which Luserne requires.\r\n\r\nThe natural Poorness of an hot Gravel may be compensated by Dung, more\r\nHeat, and the Benefit of the Hoe.\r\n\r\nThe natural Richness of the other sorts of Land being increased by\r\nhoeing and cleansing it from Grass, Luserne will thrive therein with\r\nthe less Heat; for what the Soil wants of one of these Two Qualities,\r\nmust be made up with the other; and it has grown high in hoed rich\r\nGround at _Christmas_, when that in Land of an hotter Nature, but\r\npoorer, has not been able to peep out, for want of more Nourishment:\r\nSo, if rich Land be clayey, very wet and cold, tho’ very rich, it\r\nrequires much Heat, for as high a Growth of Luserne at _Midsummer_.\r\n\r\nThe best Season of planting it in _England_ is in _April_, after the\r\nDanger of Frost is over; for a small Frost will destroy the whole Crop,\r\nwhen the Plants first appear; and too much Wet, with cold Weather, will\r\nrot the Seeds in the Ground; so that about the Middle of _April_ may be\r\ngenerally esteemed as the best Season for sowing this Seed.\r\n\r\nThe hoed Plants of Luserne having larger Roots, and yielding more Crops\r\nthan those of St. Foin, Reason seems to require, that the Number of the\r\nformer be less.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, if we consider, that as the Luserne-roots\r\nexceed the St. Foin in Bigness, so they also do in Length, by as great\r\na Proportion; being generally less taper, and as they go deeper, they\r\nhave more Earth to nourish them; they also require a better Soil, and\r\nmore frequent Aids from the Hoe; and, by their extraordinary quick\r\nGrowth, receive a speedier Relief from it, than the Roots of St. Foin\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nThus, if by reaching deeper in a better Soil, and being more hoed,\r\nLuserne receives, from a square Perch of Ground, Nourishment in a\r\nproportion double to that whereby its Roots exceed those of St. Foin\r\nin Bigness, then I do not see why we should not leave the Number of\r\nLuserne-plants double to the Number of those we leave in St. Foin.\r\n\r\nBut if the Excess of Nourishment were no more than the Excess of\r\nBigness of Roots, I think an equal Number of Plants should be left in\r\nLuserne, and in St. Foin: Yet since the hot or cold Constitution of a\r\nPlant, and also the Quantity it can produce, ought to be considered,\r\nas well as its Bulk, in relation to the Nourishment it requires, more\r\nTrials are necessary for determining the exact Number of Luserne-plants\r\nproper to be placed on a square Perch, than have been hitherto made.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be thought heterodox to maintain by any Arguments, that\r\nto err in falling somewhat short of the just Number, is not of worse\r\nConsequence, than exceeding it.\r\n\r\nWhere they stand at Four or Five Inches asunder in the Rows, ’tis\r\nobserved, that tho’ the Intervals betwixt the Rows be wide, yet the\r\nPlants are much the larger, and produce more that stand in the outside\r\nRows (the Ground without being clean); and especially those at each\r\nEnd of the outside Rows, that is, the Corner-plants, are largest of\r\nall. I need not say, that had all the other Plants as much Room and\r\nTillage as the Corner ones have, they would be as large, and produce\r\neach as much Hay; for those which stand perfectly single in Places by\r\nthemselves, are seen to be larger, and produce more, than those Corner\r\nones; and of the larger and longer Roots our Stock does consist, the\r\nmore Nourishment they are capable of taking, as has been shewn. Where\r\nsome Plants of the Luserne have been planted Two Feet asunder, in poor\r\ndry Land, which was kept clean from Weeds, and frequently digged, each\r\nPlant has sent forth upward of Three Hundred Stalks, and these have\r\nbeen Six or Seven Inches high by the Middle of _March_.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be likewise observ’d, that the Crop will be produc’d in\r\nProportion to the Nourishment it receives; for if the most gigantic\r\nLuserne plant, which, when pamper’d by the Hoe, has made a Produce more\r\nlike a Tree than an Herb, remains a few Years without that or some\r\nequivalent Culture, it will by little and little cease to produce more\r\nthan a few poor sickly Stalks, just to shew its Species; and then, if\r\nthis Culture be repeated, will recover its pristine Strength, and yield\r\nas great a Crop as ever; but, if that be longer omitted, will die: The\r\nVastness of its Root avails nothing, unless it has Food in proportion\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that the most fatal Disease incident to Luserne is\r\nstarving, and that rarely suffers any of its Plants to arrive at the\r\nfull Period of their Growth or Age; it prevents their Fertility even\r\nin the Prime of their Youth, and kills them before they have liv’d out\r\nHalf, or perhaps the Tenth Part, of their Days. How long its Life might\r\notherwise be, nobody knows, unless a Plant could be found to die when\r\nwell fed; for when it is, ’tis so tenacious of Life, that, I am told,\r\nbeheading will not dispatch it[199].\r\n\r\n  [199] But I have cut off the Heads of some myself to try, and could\r\n  not find that any one would sprout again, tho’ _St. Foin_ will;\r\n  perhaps I tried at the wrong Season.\r\n\r\n’Tis therefore necessary, that our Rows be plac’d at such a Distance,\r\nas that their Intervals may be wide enough for the Hoe-plough to raise\r\nan artificial Pasture, sufficient to sustain the Number of Plants in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhoever shall make Trials of this Husbandry (for that is all I propose\r\nto others), I would advise them to begin with Rows that have Intervals\r\nof Thirty-three Inches; for, if they begin with much narrower\r\nDistances, they may be by that means disappointed of Success: But\r\ntho’ they should afterwards find a Way to hoe them at somewhat nearer\r\nDistances; yet the Loss of a few Perches of Ground would not be much;\r\nneither can they be wholly lost, since the Roots of these Plants may\r\nbe prov’d to extend much farther horizontally, than from Row to Row at\r\nthat Distance. And the wider the Intervals are, the more Earth will be\r\ntill’d in a Perch of Ground; because Six Rows, which will be therein at\r\nThirty-three Inches Distance, will admit the Hoe-plough to till more\r\nEarth, than Nine Rows at Twenty-two Inches Distance from each other:\r\nAnd, besides, ’tis not proper, that every time of hoeing, the Plough\r\nshould come very near to the Plants, unless when Grass comes amongst\r\nthem; and then they may, in Thirty-three Inch Spaces, be perfectly\r\ncleansed in this manner: _viz._ Plow a good Furrow from each Side of\r\nevery Row; and then with Harrows, or other Instruments proper for that\r\nPurpose, going cross them, you will pull out both Earth and Grass from\r\nbetwixt the Plants; then, after a convenient Time, plow these Furrows\r\nback again to the Rows; this will in a manner transplant the upper Part\r\nof the Roots, and bury the Grass, tho’ it be not dead, by lying open to\r\nbe dry’d by the Sun: Then harrow the Ground to break it more, and to\r\nlevel it, and go once over it with a very light Roller, to the End that\r\nthe Hay may be raked up the cleaner.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the common Prejudice, which is, that People, when they\r\nhave never seen a Plantation of these Plants in Perfection, are apt to\r\nform to themselves the Idea of such small ones as they have been used\r\nto see; and thence imagine it impossible that this (tho’ a double)\r\nNumber should be sufficient to make a Crop. But they might, with equal\r\nReason, imagine the same of Apple-trees at a Year’s Growth, which are\r\nless than these at the same Age; and so plant a Thousand Trees in the\r\nRoom proper for one. The Antients direct the Planting of Seventeen\r\n_Cytisus_ Plants in a Perch of Ground; and I do not believe, that ever\r\nthose Seventeen could yield a Crop equal to Two hundred Twenty-four\r\nLuserne-plants; for as many Ounces of Hay as each of these yields, so\r\nmany Ton of Hay will one Crop of an Acre produce: Thus by weighing the\r\nProduct of one Plant (supposing them all equal) the Quantity of the\r\nCrop may be determin’d, and prov’d greater than Fancy from their Number\r\nrepresents.\r\n\r\n                                                               _s._ _d._\r\n  _April_ 14. One single unho’d Plant of Luserne had\r\n  Thirty-one Stalks, which, by Silver-Money, weigh’d green      23    0\r\n  24. The same dried to Hay, weigh’d                             6    6\r\n  14. The Stalks of one single ho’d Luserne-plant green,\r\n  weigh’d                                                       56    0\r\n  24. The same dry’d                                            14    6\r\n  14. Eighteen Inches in Length of a Row, being five\r\n  indifferent Plants, weigh’d green one Pound and an half\r\n  _Avoirdupois_\r\n  24. Dry’d to Hay, it weigh’d                                  28    6\r\n  25. One Foot of an ho’d Row, being One hundred and Sixty\r\n  Stalks of two Luserne Plants of Six or Seven Years old,\r\n  weigh’d Two Pound green\r\n  But the same dry’d, to the 9th of _May_, weigh’d no more\r\n  than                                                          31    6\r\n  Which last is about Three Tons to an Acre.\r\n\r\nThis I am certain of, that the least competent Number of Plants will\r\nbring the greatest Number of Crops: since I see the Stalks of a\r\nsingle ho’d Plant grow higher in Fifteen Days, than one amongst near\r\nNeighbours does in Thirty Days.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Difference between the Culture of this and St. Foin is,\r\nthat Luserne Rows should be more grown, before the Plants be made\r\nsingle in them by the Hand-hoe, lest the Fly should destroy some\r\nafterwards, and then they might become too thin. For Luserne is\r\nsometimes eaten by the Fly, as Turneps are, tho’ St. Foin be never\r\nliable to that Misfortune, if sown in a proper Season. Luserne must\r\nalso be more frequently ho’d[200], in some Proportion to the more\r\nfrequent Crops it produces.\r\n\r\n  [200] The Hoe-plough is the Instrument to bring it to Perfection:\r\n  but then I doubt it must lie still some Years, lest the plow’d Earth\r\n  injure the Hay that is made upon it; and when it is come to a Turf,\r\n  and the Luserne wants renewing, the Four coulter’d Plough is the\r\n  only Instrument that can prepare the Turf to be kill’d, and cure the\r\n  Luserne; which Plough must be used in the following Manner: Turn its\r\n  Furrows toward one Row, and from the next; that is, plow round one\r\n  Row, and that will finish Two Intervals, and so on; and the next\r\n  Plowing must be towards those Rows, from whence they were turn’d the\r\n  first time; take care the first Furrows do not lie long enough on the\r\n  Rows to kill the Plants, which will be much longer in Winter than in\r\n  Summer. But you may leave every Third or Fourth Interval unhoed for\r\n  making the Hay on, which will be yet more beneficial, if the Swarths\r\n  in mowing should fall thereon. This unhoed Interval may be plowed\r\n  when there is Occasion, and another left in its stead.\r\n\r\nI shall not go about to compute the Difference of Expence bestow’d\r\nin the _Roman_ Culture and in this; yet it will appear theirs was\r\nincomparably more chargeable, and that the Excess of Charge was\r\noccasioned by their Error in the Theory of Husbandry.\r\n\r\nThey sow’d it so thick, that the Plants must needs be very small; and\r\nwhen Ten of them were no bigger than one good single ho’d Plant would\r\nhave been, in the same Space of the Earth’s Surface, they could have\r\nbut a Ninth Part of the Earth’s Depth, which the one would have had.\r\nThe Defect of Depth must be therefore made up, in some Measure, by the\r\nextraordinary Richness of the Surface. Upon this Account few Lands\r\nwere capable of bearing _Medica_. Their sowing it so late made the\r\nfirst Waterings necessary; and the Shortness of the Roots required the\r\nrepeated Rigations, after the Crops were cut: For _Columella_ saith\r\nin _Lib._ ii. _Cap._ 11. _Cum secueris autem, sæpius eam rigato._\r\nBut had it been cultivated by the hoeing Method, the Tap-roots would\r\nhave descended as deep as a Well, and, from the Springs below, have\r\nsent up Water to the Plants, besides what the Hoe would have caused\r\nthe horizontal Roots to receive from Dews at the Surface above. At\r\nhow much a cheaper Rate Water is supply’d by these Means, than by\r\ncarrying it perhaps a great Way, and then sprinkling it by Hand over\r\nthe Beds, which were made Ten feet wide between Path and Path for\r\nthat Purpose, let any one judge; as also what a laborious Task it was\r\nto pick out the Grass with Fingers from amongst it, in the hard dry\r\nGround in the Summer, after mowing the Crop, as _Columella_ directs in\r\nhis foremention’d Chapter, which the Horse-hoe would have done with\r\nEase, at a Twentieth Part of that Expence. However, since they saw\r\nthe _Medica_ was as impatient of Grass as the Vineyards were, ’tis a\r\nWonder they did not give it the same Culture with the _Bidens_, which\r\nwould have been much better and cheaper, than to cleanse the _Medica_\r\nwith Fingers. Indeed Fingers were made before the _Bidens_; but sure\r\nthe Effect of its Use in raising Juices to the Vine, had inspired the\r\n_Romans_ with more judicious Speculations, than to give that for a\r\nReason why they ho’d the _Medica_ with their Fingers, rather than with\r\nthe _Bidens_.\r\n\r\nOh! But this was made with Iron, and _Medica_ had, in those Times, an\r\nAntipathy to Iron; and after it was sown, the Place must not be touch’d\r\nby that Metal; therefore the Seed must not be cover’d with a Plough,\r\nnor with Iron Harrows. But if they had made Trials enough, to know that\r\nhalf an Inch was a proper Depth to cover this Seed at, these _Virtuosi_\r\nwould have been convinc’d, that it had no less Antipathy to these\r\nInstruments, of what _Matter_ soever they were made, if they bury’d it\r\nFive or Six Inches deep, which the Plough must do, and the Weight of\r\nIron Harrows in such fine Ground not much less. Had the Plough been all\r\nof Wood, the Furrow would have lain never the lighter upon the Seed;\r\nand if the wooden Harrows had been loaded with a Weight capable of\r\npressing it down as deep, it would have been no more able to rise, than\r\nif it had been buried with Iron Harrows: This _Columella_ seems to be\r\nsensible of, when he says, _Rastellis ligneis_; _viz._ That it was not\r\nsufficient for them to be made of Wood, unless they were diminutive;\r\nfor then they were light ones. ’Tis probable the Plough suffer’d none\r\nto come up, and the heavy Harrows very few, tho’ perhaps Plants enough,\r\nhad they calculated what Number were sufficient: But unless the Ground\r\nwere cover’d with them at first, it seems they had not Patience to wait\r\ntill the Plants grew large enough, to fill it with a bare competent\r\nNumber, and thought it not worth while to weed and water, what they\r\nfansied to be an insufficient Number. ’Twas expected that the Thickness\r\nof the Plants should help to kill the Grass: Yet upon due Observation\r\n’tis found, that when their excessive Numbers have brought a Famine\r\namongst them, they are forc’d to prey upon one another; and tho’ the\r\nstronger survive, yet even those are so weaken’d by Hunger, that they\r\nbecome the less able to contend with Grass, whose good Fortune it\r\nwas, that Superstition would not permit the _Romans_ to interpose, by\r\nattacking it with Iron Weapons.\r\n\r\nI hope these Hints may be improv’d for the Abolition of old Errors, and\r\nfor the Discovery of new Truths; to the end that Luserne may be planted\r\nin a more reasonable Method than has been commonly practis’d: And when\r\nthe Theory is true, ’tis impossible the Practice should be false, if\r\nrightly apply’d; but if it fail of Success, the Event will be a Proof\r\neither of a Misapplication, or that the Theory is false.\r\n\r\nLuserne should be order’d for Hay in the same Manner as is directed\r\nfor St. Foin in the foregoing Chapter: But it must be observ’d, that\r\nLuserne is more worsted by being suffer’d to survive its Virginity\r\nbefore cutting; and therefore the richest and most nourishing Hay is\r\ncut whilst the Stalks are single, without any collateral Branches\r\nshooting out of them; and when they are so, neither Blossoms nor even\r\ntheir Buds appear. But of that sown in the old Fashion, the last Crops,\r\nfor want of a new Supply of Nourishment, grow so slowly, that ere it\r\nis high enough to be cut, the Blossoms are blown out, and the Stalks,\r\ntho’ very small, are become _woody, hard_, and _dry_, and make the Hay\r\nnothing near so nourishing as that of the first Crops.\r\n\r\nBut in that which is ho’d, the last Crops of it will, by virtue of the\r\ngreater Quantity of Nourishment it receives, grow faster, and be of\r\nan Height fit to cut before blossoming, and thence being as young and\r\nvigorous, make as good Hay as the first Crops; so that Hoeing does not\r\nonly procure more and larger Crops, but also better Hay.\r\n\r\nThis is most certain, that unless we can keep our Luserne pretty clean\r\nfrom natural Grass, we cannot expect it to succeed, let the Soil be\r\nnever so proper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIV.\r\n\r\n_Of Change of_ SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  I. _That Plants of the most different Nature feed on the same Sort of\r\n  Food._\r\n\r\n  II. _That there is no Plant but what must rob any other Plant within\r\n  its Reach._\r\n\r\n  III. _That a Soil which is proper to one Sort of Vegetable once, is,\r\n  in Respect of the Sort of Food it gives, proper to it always._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any one of these _Three Propositions_ be true, as I hope to prove\r\nall of them are, then it will follow, that there is no need to change\r\nthe Species of _Vegetables_ from one Year to another, in respect to the\r\ndifferent Food the same Soil is, tho’ falsely, supposed to yield[201].\r\n\r\n  [201] For if all Plants rob one another, it must be because they all\r\n  feed on the same Sort of Food; and, admitting they do, there can\r\n  be no Necessity of changing the Species of them, from one Soil to\r\n  another; but the same Quantity of the same Food, with the same Heat\r\n  and Moisture which maintains any Species one Year, must do it any\r\n  other Year.\r\n\r\nThe common Opinion is contrary to all these (as it must be, if contrary\r\nto any one of them): And since an Error in this fundamental Principle\r\nof _Vegetation_ is of very ill Consequence; and since Dr. _Woodward_,\r\nwho has been serviceable in other respects[202] to this Art, has\r\nunhappily fallen in with the Vulgar in this Point; his Arguments for\r\nthis Error require to be answer’d in the first Place.\r\n\r\n  [202] By proving, in his Experiments, that Earth is the _Pabulum_ of\r\n  Plants.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor says[203] ‘It is not possible to imagine how one uniform,\r\nhomogeneous Matter, having its Principles, or original Parts, all of\r\nthe same Substance, Constitution, Magnitude, Figure, and Gravity,\r\nshould ever constitute Bodies so egregiously _unlike_, in all those\r\nRespects, as Vegetables of different Kinds are; nay, even as the\r\ndifferent Parts of the _same_ Vegetable.’\r\n\r\n  [203] In _Philos. Trans._ No. 253.\r\n\r\n‘That there should be that vast Difference in them, in their several\r\nConstitutions, Makes, Properties, and Effects, and yet all arise from\r\nthe very same Sort of Matter, would be very strange.’\r\n\r\n_Answer._ ’Tis very probable, that the terrestrial Particles which\r\nconstitute _Vegetables_, tho’ inconceivably minute, may be of great\r\nVariety of Figure, and other Differences; else they could not be\r\ncapable of the several Ferments, _&c._ they must undergo in the Vessels\r\nof Plants. Their Smalness can be no Objection to their Variety, since\r\neven the Particles of Light are of various Kinds.\r\n\r\nBut as the Doctor asserts, ‘That each Part of the same _Vegetable_\r\nrequires a peculiar specific Matter for its Formation and Nourishment;\r\nand that there are very many and different Ingredients to go to the\r\nComposition of the same individual Plants;’\r\n\r\nFrom hence must be inferred, that the same Plant takes in very many\r\nand different Ingredients (and it is proved, that no Plant refuses\r\nany Ingredient[204] that is capable of entering its Roots. Tho’ the\r\nterrestrial Particles which nourish _Vegetables_, be not perfectly\r\nhomogeneous; yet most of the various Tastes and Flavours of Plants are\r\nmade in and by the Vessels[205].\r\n\r\n  [204] Dr. _Grew_, in his Anatomy of Plants, by microscopical\r\n  Inspection, found, that the outer Superficies of Roots was of a\r\n  spongy Substance; and ’tis well known, that no such Body can refuse\r\n  to imbibe whatever Liquor comes in Contact with it, but will by its\r\n  springy Porosity absorb any sort of Moisture.\r\n\r\n  [205] We are convinced, that ’tis the Vessels of Plants that make the\r\n  different Flavours; because there is none of these Flavours in the\r\n  Earth of which they are made, until that has enter’d and been alter’d\r\n  by the vegetable Vessels.\r\n\r\nDoctor _Woodward_ says, ‘That Water will pass Pores and Interstices,\r\nthat neither Air, nor any other Fluid, will: This enables it to\r\nenter the finest Tubes and Vessels of Plants, and to introduce the\r\nterrestrial Matter, conveying it to all Parts of them; whilst each,\r\nby means of Organs ’tis endow’d with for the Purpose, intercepts,\r\nand assumes into itself, such Particles as are suitable to its own\r\nNature[206]; letting the rest pass on _through the common Ducts_.’\r\n\r\n  [206] If the Doctor’s Plants were so nice in leaving vegetable Matter\r\n  _behind, quiet and undisturb’d_, ’tis a Wonder they would take up the\r\n  mineral Matter, as, he says, they did, that kill’d themselves with\r\n  Nitre.\r\n\r\n  These Plants might, with much less Difficulty, have distinguish’d the\r\n  mineral Matter from the vegetable Matter, than they could distinguish\r\n  the different Particles of vegetable Matter from one another, and\r\n  must have been very unwise to chuse out the Nitre (their Poison) from\r\n  the Water and Earth, and to leave the vegetable Particles behind;\r\n  none of which could be so improper to them as the Nitre.\r\n\r\n  It may perhaps be objected, that such like pernicious Matter kills a\r\n  Plant by only destroying its Roots, and by closing the Pores; which\r\n  prevents the Nourishment from entering to maintain its Life; and that\r\n  such Matter doth not itself enter to act as Poison upon the Sap, or\r\n  upon the Vessels of the Body, or Leaves: But it plainly appears that\r\n  it doth enter, and act as Poison; for when some of the Roots of a\r\n  Mint, growing in Water, are put into salt Water, it kills the whole\r\n  Plant, although the rest of the Roots remaining in the fresh Water\r\n  were sufficient to maintain it, if the other Roots had been cut off\r\n  at the Time they were removed into the Salt Water; and also all the\r\n  Leaves, when dead, will be full of Salt.\r\n\r\n  Or if the Juice of wild Garlick-seed be made use of instead of the\r\n  salt Water, it will have the same Effect; and every one of the\r\n  Mint-leaves will have a strong Taste of Garlick in it.\r\n\r\nHere then he says plainly, That each Plant receives the terrestrial\r\nMatter in gross, both suitable and unsuitable to its Nature, retains\r\nthe suitable Particles for its Augment, and the unsuitable lets pass\r\nthrough it. And in another Place he says they are exhal’d into the\r\nAtmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnd this will appear to be the true Case of Plants; and directly\r\ncontradicts what he advances, in saying, ‘That each Sort of Grain takes\r\nforth that peculiar Matter that is proper for its own Nourishment.\r\nFirst, the Wheat draws off those Particles that suit the Body of that\r\nPlant, _the rest lying all quiet and undisturb’d the while_. And when\r\nthe Earth has yielded up all them, those that are proper for Barley, a\r\ndifferent Grain, remain still behind, till the successive Crops of that\r\nCorn fetch them forth too; and so the Oats and Pease in their turn,\r\ntill, in fine, all is carried off.’\r\n\r\nIn the former Paragraph he says, each Plant _lets pass through it_\r\nthe rest of the Particles that are not suitable to its own Nature. In\r\nthe latter Paragraph he says, That each _leaves_ the unsuitable _all\r\nbehind_ for another Sort; and so on.\r\n\r\nBoth cannot be true.\r\n\r\nIf the latter were true, Change of Sorts would be as necessary as it is\r\ncommonly thought. But if the former be true, as I hope to prove it is,\r\nthen there can be no Use of changing of Sorts in Respect of different\r\nNourishment.\r\n\r\nIf in this Series of Crops each Sort were so just as to take only such\r\nParticles, as are peculiarly proper to it, letting all the rest alone\r\nto the other Sorts to which they belonged, as the Doctor imagines;\r\nthen it would be equal to them all, which of the Sorts were sown first\r\nor last: But let the Wheat be sown after the Barley, Pease, and Oats,\r\ninstead of being sown before them, and then it would evidently appear,\r\nby that starv’d Crop of Wheat, either that some or all of those other\r\nGrains had violated this natural Probity, or else that Nature has\r\ngiven to _Vegetables_ no such Law of _Meum_ and _Tuum_[207].\r\n\r\n  [207] A Charlock could not rob a Turnep, and starve it, more than\r\n  several Turneps can do, unless the Charlock did take from it the same\r\n  Particles which would nourish a Turnep; and unless the Charlock did\r\n  devour a greater Quantity of that Nourishment than several Turneps\r\n  could take.\r\n\r\n  Flax, Oats, and Poppy, could not burn or waste the Soil, and make it\r\n  less able to produce succeeding Crops of different Species, unless\r\n  they did exhaust the same Particles which would have nourish’d Plants\r\n  of different Species: For let the Quantity of Particles these Burners\r\n  take be never so great, the following Crops would not miss them, or\r\n  suffer any Damage by the Want or Loss of them, were they not the same\r\n  Particles which would have nourished those Crops, if the Burners had\r\n  left them _behind, quiet and undisturbed_. Neither could Weeds be of\r\n  any Prejudice to Corn, if they did draw off those Particles only that\r\n  suit the Bodies of Weeds, _the rest lying all quiet and undisturbed\r\n  the while_. But constant Experience shews, that all Sorts of Weeds,\r\n  more or less, diminish the Crop of Corn.\r\n\r\nIf these Things were, as the Doctor affirms, why do Farmers lose a\r\nYear’s Rent, and be at the Charge of fallowing and manuring their\r\nLand, after so few Crops; since there are many more Sorts of Grain as\r\ndifferent from these and one another, as those are which they usually\r\nsow?\r\n\r\nThey still find, that the first Crops are best; and the longer they\r\ncontinue sowing, the worst the last Crops will prove, be they of never\r\nso different a Species; unless the Land were not in so good Tilth for\r\nthe first Crop as for the subsequent; or unless the last sown be of a\r\nmore robust Species.\r\n\r\nThis Matter might be easily clear’d, could we perfectly know the Nature\r\nof those supposed _unsuitable_[208] _Particles_; but, in Truth, there\r\nis no more to be known of such of them, than that they are carried\r\naway by the Atmosphere to a Distance, according to the Velocity of the\r\nAir; perhaps several Miles off, at least, never like to return to the\r\nSpot of Ground from whence the Plants have raised them.\r\n\r\n  [208] But we must not conclude, that these Particles, which pass\r\n  through a Plant (being a vastly greater Quantity than those that\r\n  abide in it for its Augment), are all unsuitable, because no one of\r\n  them happens to hit upon a fit _Nidus_: For since the Life of Animals\r\n  depends upon that of Plants, ’tis not unreasonable to imagine, that\r\n  Nature may have provided a considerable Overplus for maintaining the\r\n  Life of individual Plants, when she has provided such an innumerable\r\n  Overplus for continuing every Species of Animals.\r\n\r\nBut suppose these cast-off Particles were, when taken in, unfit for the\r\nNourishment of any manner of Vegetables: Then the Doctor must fansy\r\nthe Wheat to be of a very scrupulous Conscience, to feed on these\r\nParticles, which were neither fit for its own Nourishment, nor of\r\nany other Plant; and at the same time to forbear to take the Food of\r\nBarley, Pease, and Oats, letting that _lie still and undisturb’d the\r\nwhile_, as he says it does, tho’ he gives no manner of Reason for it.\r\n\r\n’Tis needless to bring stronger Arguments, than the Doctor’s\r\nExperiments afford, against his own vulgar Opinion, of Plants\r\ndistinguishing the particular Sort of terrestrial Matter, that, he\r\nsays, is proper to each Sort of _Vegetable_, in these Words; _viz._\r\n‘Each Sort takes forth that peculiar Matter that is proper for its own\r\nNourishment, the _rest lying all quiet and undisturb’d the while_.’\r\n\r\nHe says, that great Part of the terrestrial Matter, mixed with the\r\nWater, passes up into the Plant along with it; which it could not do,\r\nif only the peculiar Matter, proper to each Plant, did pass up into\r\nit: And after he has shewed how apt the vegetable Matter is to attend\r\nWater in all its Motions, and to follow it into each of its Recesses;\r\nbeing by no Filtrations or Percolations wholly separable from it; ’tis\r\nstrange he should think that each Plant leaves the greatest Part of it\r\nbehind, separated from the Water which the Plant imbibes.\r\n\r\nThere are, doubtless, more than a Million of Sorts of Plants, all of\r\nwhich would have taken up the Water, and had each as much Right to its\r\nShare, or proper Matter in it, as the Doctor’s Plants had; and then\r\nthere would be but a very small (or a Millionth) Part of it proper to\r\neach of his Plants: And these leaving all the rest behind, both of the\r\nWater wherewith the Glasses at first were filled, when the Plants were\r\nput into them; and also of all the additional Water daily supply’d into\r\nthem afterwards; I say, so much more terrestrial Matter brought into\r\nthese Glasses, in Proportion to the added Water, and so very small\r\na Part as could be proper to each of his plants being carried off;\r\nthere must have remain’d in these Glasses a much greater Quantity of\r\nterrestrial Matter at the End of the Experiment, than remained in the\r\nGlasses _F_ or _G_, which had no Plants in them, nor any Water added\r\nto, or diminished from them; but the quite contrary appear’d. ‘And\r\nthe Water in the Glasses _F_ and _G_, at the End of the Experiment,\r\nexhibited a larger Quantity of terrestrial Matter, than any of those\r\nthat had Plants in them did. The Sediment at the Bottom of the Glasses\r\nwas greater, and the _Nubeculæ_ diffused thro’ the Body of the Water\r\nthicker.’ Had the _Cataputia_ insum’d, with the Two thousand Five\r\nhundred and One Grains of Water, no more than its proper Share of the\r\nvegetable Matter, it could not have attained thence an Increase of\r\nThree Grains and a Quarter, nor even the Thousandth Part of One Grain.\r\nBut he found ‘this terrestrial Matter, contained in all Water, to be of\r\nTwo Kinds: The one properly, a vegetable Matter, but consisting of very\r\ndifferent Particles; some of which are proper for the Nourishment of\r\nsome kind of Plants, others for different Sorts,’ _&c._\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, would have been a most wonderful Discovery, and might\r\nhave given us a great Light, if he had told us in what Language and\r\nCharacter these proper Differences were stamp’d or written upon the\r\nvegetable Particles; which Particles themselves, he says, were scarce\r\nvisible. Certainly it must be a great Art (much beyond that of Dr.\r\n_Wallis_) to decypher the Language of Plants, from invisible Characters.\r\n\r\nBut that this Dream may deceive none, except such who are very fond\r\nof old Errors, there is an _Experimentum Crucis_ which may convince\r\nthem; _viz._ At the proper Season, tap a Birch-tree in the Body or\r\nBoughs, and you may have thence a large Quantity of clear Liquor, very\r\nlittle altered from Water; and you may see, that every other Species\r\nof Plants, that will grow in Water, will receive this; live and grow\r\nin it, as well as in common Water. You may make a like Experiment by\r\ntapping other Trees, or by Water distilled from Vegetables; and you\r\nwill find no Species of Plants, into which this Water will not enter,\r\nand pass through it, and nourish it too; unless it be such a Species as\r\nrequires more Heat than Water admits; or unless the peculiar Vessels\r\nof that it has first passed through, have so altered the vegetable\r\nParticles contained in that Water, as that it acts as Poison upon some\r\nother particular Species.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor concludes, ‘That Water is only the Agent that conveys\r\nthe Vegetable Matter to the Bodies of Plants, that introduces and\r\ndistributes it to their several Parts for their Nourishment: That\r\nMatter is sluggish and inactive, and would lie eternally confin’d to\r\nits Beds of Earth, without ever advancing up into Plants, did not\r\nWater, or some like Instrument, fetch it forth, and carry it unto them.’\r\n\r\nThat Water is very capable of the Office of a Carrier to Plants, I\r\nthink the Doctor has made most evident; but as to the Office of such\r\nan Agent as his Hypothesis bestows upon it, it seems impossible to\r\nbe executed by Water. For it cannot be imagined, that Water, being\r\nitself but mere homogenial Matter, void of all Degrees of Life, should\r\ndistinguish each Particle of vegetable Matter, proper and peculiar to\r\nevery different Species of Plants, which are innumerable; and when ’tis\r\nto act for the Wheat, to find out all the Particles proper to that sort\r\nof Grain, to rouse only those particular Sluggards from their Beds of\r\nEarth, letting all the rest lie quiet and undisturbed the while. This\r\nAgent frees the Wheat-Particles from their Confinement, and conveys,\r\nintroduces, and distributes them, and only them, into the several Parts\r\nof the Wheat.\r\n\r\nSince ’tis unreasonable to believe, that Water can have such\r\nextraordinary Skill in Botany, or in Micrography, as to be qualified\r\nfor a sufficient Agent in such an abstruse Matter, I conceive Water\r\nto be only an Instrument or Vehicle, which takes up indifferently any\r\nParticles it meets with (and is able to carry), and advances them\r\n(or the _Pabulum_ they yield) up into the First Plant, whose Root it\r\ncomes in Contact with; and that every Plant it meets with does accept\r\nthereof, without distinguishing any different Sorts or Properties\r\nin them, until they be so far introduc’d and advanc’d up into the\r\nvegetable Vessels, that it would be in vain to distinguish them; for\r\nwhether the terrestrial Matter, Plants imbibe with the Water, will kill\r\nor nourish them, appears by its Effects; but which cannot be foreknown\r\nor prevented without the Help of Faculties, which Plants are not\r\nendow’d with.\r\n\r\nMr. _Bradley_ seems to have carried this Error farther than any Author\r\never did before; but he supports it by Affirmations only, or by such\r\nArguments (I cannot say Reasons; for no Reason can be against any\r\nTruth) as go near to confute the very Opinion he pretends to advance by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHe ascribes to Vegetables the Sense of Taste, by which he thinks\r\nthey take such Nourishment as is most agreeable to their respective\r\nNatures, refuting the rest; and will rather starve, than eat what is\r\ndisagreeable to their Palate.\r\n\r\nIn the Preface to his _Vol._ I. _Page_ 10. of his _Husbandry_ and\r\n_Gardening_, he says, ‘They feed as differently as Horses do from Dogs,\r\nor Dogs from Fish.’\r\n\r\nBut what does he mean by this Instance, _Vol._ I. _p._ 39. _viz._ ‘That\r\nThyme, and other Aromatics, being planted near an Apricot-tree, would\r\ndestroy that Tree?’ Does it not help to confirm, that every Plant does\r\nnot draw exactly the same Share of Nourishment?\r\n\r\nI believe there is no need for him to give more Instances to disprove\r\nhis Assertion than this one. His Conclusion, taken by itself, is so far\r\nright; _viz._ ‘That if the Nourishment the Earth afforded to the Thyme\r\nand Apricot-tree, had been divided into Two Shares, both could not have\r\nhad them.’\r\n\r\nBut this his Instance proves, That those Aromatics robb’d the\r\nApricot-tree of so much of its Share as to starve it; and that they,\r\ntho’ of so very different a Nature, did draw from the Earth the same\r\nNourishment which the Apricot-tree should have taken for its Support,\r\nhad not the Aromatics been too hard for it, in drawing it off for their\r\nown Maintenance:\r\n\r\nUnless he believes, that all the Juices of the Aromatics were as\r\nPoison to the Apricot; and that, according to my Experiment of the\r\nMint, some of their Roots might discharge some kind of Moisture in dry\r\nWeather, given them by others, that had it for their Use; and that the\r\nApricot-roots, mingling with them, might imbibe enough of that Liquor,\r\naltered sufficiently by their Vessels, to poison and kill the Tree.\r\n\r\nBut then, where was the Tree’s distinguishing Palate? Why did it not\r\nrefuse this Juice, which was so disagreeable as to kill it? And as to\r\nhis Notion of Vegetables having Palates, let us see how it agrees with\r\nwhat he affirms.\r\n\r\n‘That ’tis the Vessels of Plants that make, by their Filtrations,\r\nPercolations, _&c._ all the different Tastes and Flavours of the\r\nMatter, which is the Aliment of Plants; and that, before it be by them\r\nso filtred, _&c._ it is only a Fund of insipid Substance, capable of\r\nbeing altered by such Vessels, into any Form, Colour, or Flavour.’\r\n\r\nAnd _Vol._ I. _p._ 38. ‘The different Strainers, or Vessels of the\r\nseveral Plants, growing upon that Spot of Earth, thus impregnated with\r\nSalts, alter those Salts or Juices, according to the several Figures or\r\nDimensions of their Strainers; so that one Plant varies, in Taste and\r\nSmell, from others, tho’ all draw their Nourishment from the same Stock\r\nlodged in the Earth.’ See Mr. _Bradley_’s _Palates of Plants_, and the\r\ninsipid Substance he allots them to distinguish the Taste of, how they\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nThey must, it seems, within their own Bodies, give the Flavour to this\r\ninsipid Substance, before their Palates can be of any Use; and, even\r\nthen, ’tis impossible to be of any Use, but in the manner of the Dog\r\nreturning to his Vomit.\r\n\r\nThey would have as much Occasion for the Sense of Smelling, as of\r\nTaste; but, after all, of what Use could either of the Two be to\r\nPlants, without local Motion of their Roots? which they are so\r\ndestitute of, that no Mouth of a Root can ever remove itself from\r\nthe very Point where it was first formed, because a Root has all its\r\nlongitudinal Increase at the very End; for, should the Spaces betwixt\r\nthe Branchings increase in Length, those Branches would be broken\r\noff, and left behind, or else drawn out of their Cavities; which must\r\ndestroy the Plant. All the Branches, except the foremost, would be\r\nfound with their Extremities pointing towards the Stem; the contrary\r\nof which Posture they are seen to have: And if they moved backwards,\r\nthat would have much the same Effect on all the collateral Branchings\r\nto destroy them. Smell and Taste then could be of no manner of Use to\r\nVegetables, if they had them; they would have no Remedy or Possibility\r\nto mend themselves from the same Mouths, removing to search out other\r\nFood, in case they had Power to dislike or refuse what was offered them.\r\n\r\nTherefore the crude Earth, being their Food, simple and free from\r\nany Alterations by Vessels, remaining insipid, cannot give, neither\r\ncan Plants receive, require, or make use of, any Variety from it, as\r\nAnimals do from their Diet. It would be lost upon them, and Nature\r\nwould have acted in vain, to give Smell and Taste to Vegetables, and\r\nnothing but insipid Earth for an Object of them; or to give them a\r\ncharming Variety of Relish and Savour in their Food, without giving\r\nthem Senses necessary to perceive or enjoy them; which would be like\r\nLight and Colours to the Blind, Sound and Music to the Deaf, or like\r\ngiving Eyes and Ears to Animals, without Light or Sound to affect them.\r\n\r\nThe Mouths of Plants, situate in the convex Superficies of Roots, are\r\nanalogous to the Lacteals, or Mouths, in the concave Superficies of the\r\nIntestines of Animals.\r\n\r\nThese spongy Superficies of animal Guts, and vegetable Roots, have no\r\nmore Taste or Power of refusing whatever comes in Contact with them,\r\nthe one than the other.\r\n\r\nThe free open Air would be equally injurious to both; and if exposed\r\nto it, it would dry and close up the fine Orifices in Guts and Roots:\r\nTherefore Nature has guarded both from it.\r\n\r\nNature has also provided for the Preservation of both Vegetables and\r\nAnimals (I do not say equally) in respect of their Food; which might\r\npoison them, or might not be fit to nourish them.\r\n\r\nThe Security of Plants (the best that can be) is their Food itself,\r\nEarth; which, having been altered by no Vessels, is always safe and\r\nnourishing to them; For a Plant is never known to be poisoned by its\r\nown natural Soil, nor starved, if it were enough of it, with the\r\nrequisite Quantities of Heat and Moisture.\r\n\r\nRoots, being therefore the Guts of Plants, have no need to be guarded\r\nby Senses; and all the Parts and Passages, which serve to distinguish\r\nand prepare the Food of Animals, before it reach the Guts, are omitted\r\nin Plants, and not at all necessary to them.\r\n\r\nBut as the Food of most Animals is Earth, very variously changed and\r\nmodified by vegetable or animal Vessels, or by both, and some of it is\r\nmade wholsome, some poisonous; so that if this doubtful Food should be\r\ncommitted to the Intestines, without Examination, as the pure unaltered\r\nEarth is to Roots, there would, in all Probability, be very few Animals\r\nliving in the World, except there be any that feed on Earth at first\r\nHand only, as Plants do.\r\n\r\nTherefore, lest this Food, so much more refined than that of Plants,\r\nshould, by that very means, become a fatal Curse, instead of a Blessing\r\nto Animals, Nature has endowed them with Smell and Taste, as Sentinels,\r\nwithout whose Scrutiny these various uncertain Ingredients are not\r\nadmitted to come where they can enter the Lacteals, and to distinguish,\r\nat a sufficient Distance, what is wholsome and friendly, from what is\r\nhurtful; for when ’tis once passed out of the Stomach into the Guts,\r\n’tis too late to have Benefit from Emetics; its Venom must then be\r\nimbibed by the Lacteal Mouths, and mix with the Blood, as that must\r\nmix with the Sap, which comes in Contact with the Lacteals in the\r\nSuperficies of Roots, Nature having left this unguarded.\r\n\r\nYet Plants seem to be better secured by the Salubrity and Simplicity\r\nof their Food, than Animals are by their Senses: To compensate that\r\nInequality of Danger; Animals have Pleasure from their Senses, except\r\nsome miserable Animals (and such there are) that have more Pain than\r\nPleasure from them. But I suppose, more Animals than Plants are\r\npoison’d; and that a poisonous Animal is less fatal to a Plant, than a\r\npoisonous Plant is to an Animal.\r\n\r\nIt being sufficiently proved, that every sort of Vegetables, growing\r\nin the same Soil, takes, and is nourished, by the same Sort of Food;\r\nit follows from hence, that the beneficial Change of Sorts of Seeds or\r\nPlants, we see in the common Husbandry, is not from the Quality of the\r\nSorts of Food, but from other Causes; such as,\r\n\r\n  I. _Quantity of the Food._\r\n\r\n  II. _Constitution of the Plants._\r\n\r\n  III. _Quantity of the Tillage._\r\n\r\nIn Dr. _Woodward_’s Case, upon his Hypothesis, the Three Proportions of\r\nSeeds, _viz._ Barley, Oats, and Pease, might be sown all together in\r\nthe same Acre of Ground, the same Year, and make Three as good Crops as\r\nif sown singly in Three successive Years, and his Two Crops of Wheat\r\nin one Year likewise. But every Farmer can tell, that these Three\r\nProportions of Seed would not yield half the Crop together, as one\r\nwould do single; and would scarce produce more than to shew what Grains\r\nwere sown, and which, of the Sorts were the strongest and the most able\r\nRobber.\r\n\r\nThough this Failure would, in Truth, be from no other Cause than want\r\nof the sufficient Quantity of Food, which those Three Crops required;\r\nyet, perhaps, the Doctor might think, that all Three Crops might\r\nsucceed together very well, taking each its proper Nourishment, were it\r\nnot for want of Room, Air, and Sun.\r\n\r\nI have been credibly inform’d, that on One Perch of Ground there has\r\ngrown a Bushel of Corn, which is Twenty Quarters to an Acre. Mr.\r\n_Houghton_ relates Twenty-six, and even Thirty Quarters, of Wheat on\r\nOne Acre. There have certainly grown Twelve Quarters of Barley to an\r\nAcre, throughout a whole Field: Therefore, unless a Crop exceed the\r\nleast of these, or indeed the greatest of them (if the Relation be\r\ntrue), a Crop cannot fail for want of Room; for one Acre (be it of what\r\nNature it will, as to the Soil of it) must have as much room for a Crop\r\nto grow on, as any other Acre.\r\n\r\nThen there was room for all Dr. _Woodward_’s Three Crops together, to\r\nproduce as much as Three common Crops do. Yet all these together will\r\nscarce yield one Quarter of Corn, tho’ there is room, at least, for\r\nTwelve.\r\n\r\nThe same _Air_ and _Sun_ that had Room to do their Office to Mr.\r\n_Houghton_’s Acre, why should they not have Room to do the same to\r\nDoctor _Woodward_’s Acre, when the Three Crops growing on it at once,\r\nthrough pretty good ones, might require less Room than Mr. _Houghton_’s\r\nCrop did?\r\n\r\nI perceive that those Authors, who explain _Vegetation_, by saying\r\nthe Earth imbibes certain Qualities from the Air, and by specific\r\nQualities, and the like, do also lay a great Stress upon the\r\n_perpendicular_ Growth of _Vegetables_; seeming to fansy there is\r\nlittle else necessary to a good Crop, but Room.\r\n\r\nMr. _Bradley_, in his Arguments concerning the Value of an Hill, does\r\nimplicitly say as much.\r\n\r\nBut if they would but consider the Diameters of the Stems, with the\r\nMeasure of the Surface of an Acre, they would be convinced, that many,\r\neven of Mr. _Houghton_’s Crops, might stand in a perpendicular Posture\r\nupon an Acre, and Room be left.\r\n\r\nOne true Cause of a Crop’s failing, is want of a Quantity of Food to\r\nmaintain the Quantity of Vegetables, which the Food should nourish.\r\n\r\nWhen the Quantity of Food which is sufficient for another Species (that\r\nrequires less), but not for that which last grew, to grow again the\r\nnext Year, then that other is beneficial to be planted after it.\r\n\r\nThe Second true Cause is from the Constitution of Plants; some require\r\nmore Food than others, and some are of a stronger Make, and better able\r\nto penetrate the Earth, and forage for themselves.\r\n\r\nTherefore Oats may succeed a Crop of Wheat on strong Land, with once\r\nplowing, when Barley will not; because Barley is not so well able to\r\npenetrate as Oats, or Beans, or Pease, are.\r\n\r\nSo a Pear-tree may succeed a Plum-tree, when another Plum-tree cannot;\r\nbecause a Pear is a much stronger Tree, and grows to a much greater\r\nBulk; so inclined to be a Giant, that ’tis hard to make it a Dwarf; and\r\nwill penetrate and force its Way thro’ the untill’d Earth, where the\r\nother cannot; being of a weaker and less robust Constitution, not so\r\nwell able to shift for itself.\r\n\r\nThe Pear could penetrate Pores, that the other could not. Mr. _Evelyn_\r\nsays, in his Discourse of Forest-trees, ‘That a Pear will strike Root\r\nthro’ the roughest and most impenetrable Rocks and Clifts of Stone\r\nitself.’ He says likewise, in his _Pomona_, ‘That Pears will thrive\r\nwhere neither Apple or other Fruit could in Appearance be expected.’\r\n\r\nI can scarce think, that a large Plant takes in larger Particles than\r\na small one, for its Nourishment: If it did, I can’t believe, that the\r\nThyme could have starv’d the Apricot-tree; it must have left the larger\r\nParticles of Food for that Tree, which probably would have sufficed\r\nto keep it alive: I rather think, that great and small Plants are\r\nsustain’d by the same minute Particles; for, as the fine Particles of\r\nOats will nourish an Ox, so they will nourish a Tom-tit, or a Mite.\r\n\r\nSome Plants are of an hotter Constitution, and have a quicker\r\nDigestion, like Cormorants or Pigeons, devouring more greedily, and\r\na greater Quantity of Food, than those of a colder Temperature, of\r\nequal Bulk, whose Sap, having a more languid Motion, in proportion\r\nto the less Degree of Heat in it, sends off fewer Recrements; and\r\ntherefore a less Supply of Food is required in their room. This may\r\nmake some Difference in the one’s succeeding the other; because the\r\nhot-constitution’d leaves not enough for its own Species to succeed\r\nagain, but leaves enough for a Species of a colder Constitution to\r\nsucceed it.\r\n\r\nBut the Third and chiefest Cause of the Benefit of changing Sorts is\r\nQuantity of Tillage, in proportion to which the Food will be produced.\r\n\r\nThe true Cause why Wheat is not (especially on any strong Soil) to be\r\nsown immediately after Wheat, is, That the first Wheat standing almost\r\na Year on the Ground, by which it must grow harder; and Wheat Seed-time\r\nbeing soon after Harvest in _England_, there is not Space of Time to\r\ntill the Land so much as a second Crop of Wheat requires.\r\n\r\nTho’ sometimes in poorer Land, that is lighter, Wheat has succeeded\r\nWheat with tolerable Success; when I have seen, on very rich strong\r\nLand, the first Crop lost by being much too big, and one following it\r\nimmediately, quite lost by the Poorness of it, and not worth cutting.\r\n\r\nThis was enough to satisfy, that the Tillage which was so much easier\r\nperform’d in less Time, sufficed for the light Land, but not for the\r\nstrong: and, if the strong Land could have been brought into as good\r\nTilth as the light (like as in the new Husbandry it may), it would have\r\nproduced a much better second Crop than the light Land did.\r\n\r\nFrom all that has been said, these may be laid down as Maxims; _viz._\r\nThat the same Quantity of Tillage will produce the same Quantity of\r\nFood in the same Land[209]; and that the same Quantity of Food will\r\nmaintain the same Quantity of Vegetables.\r\n\r\n  [209] And _cæteris paribus_; for when the Land has been more\r\n  exhausted, more Tillage (or Dung) or Rest will be required to\r\n  produce the same Quantity of Food, than when the Land hath been\r\n  less exhausted. By Tillage is here meant, not only the Number of\r\n  Plowings, but the Degree of Division or Pulveration of the Soil;\r\n  or, if perchance the Soil is extraordinary much exhausted by many\r\n  Crops, without proper Tillage between them, the greater Degree of\r\n  Pulveration, by Plowing or Dung (which is only a _Succedaneum_ of\r\n  Tillage), and also a longer Time of Exposure, may be necessary to\r\n  counterpoise that extraordinary Exhaustion.\r\n\r\n’Tis seen, that the same Sort of Weeds, which once come naturally in\r\na Soil, if suffer’d to grow, will always prosper in proportion to the\r\nTillage and Manure bestow’d upon it, without any Change. And so are all\r\nmanner of Plants, that have been yet try’d by the new Husbandry, seen\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nA Vineyard, if not tilled, will soon decay, even in rich Ground, as may\r\nbe seen in those in _France_, lying intermingled as our Lands do in\r\ncommon Fields. Those Lands of Vines, which by reason of some Law-suit\r\ndepending about the Property of them, or otherwise, lie a Year or two\r\nuntilled, produce no Grapes, send out no Shoots hardly: the Leaves look\r\nyellow, and seem dead, in Comparison of those on each Side of them;\r\nwhich, being tilled, are full of Fruit, send out an hundred times more\r\nWood, and their Leaves are large and flourishing; and continue to do\r\nthe same annually for Ages, if the Plough or Hoe do not neglect them.\r\n\r\nNo Change of Sorts is needful in them, if the same annual Quantity of\r\nTillage (which appears to provide the same annual Quantity of Food) be\r\ncontinued to the Vines.\r\n\r\nBut what in the Vineyards proves this Thesis most fully is, That where\r\nthey constantly till the low Vines with the Plough, which is almost\r\nthe same with the Hoe-plough, the Stems are planted about Four Feet\r\nasunder, chequerwise; so that they plow them Four ways. When any of\r\nthese Plants happen to die, new ones are immediately planted in their\r\nroom, and exactly in the Points or Angles where the other have rotted;\r\nelse, if planted out of those Angles, they would stand in the Way of\r\nthe Plough: These young Vines, I say, so planted in the very Graves,\r\nas it were, of their Predecessors, grow, thrive, and prosper well,\r\nthe Soil being thus constantly tilled: And if a Plum-tree, or any\r\nother Plant, had such Tillage, it might as well succeed one of its own\r\nSpecies, as those Vines do.\r\n\r\n’Tis observed, that White-thorns will not prosper, set in the Gaps\r\nof a White thorn Hedge: But I have seen the Banks of such Gaps dug\r\nand thrown down one Summer, and made up again, and White-thorns there\r\nreplanted the following Winter, with good Success.\r\n\r\nBut note, That the annual plowing the Vines is more beneficial than the\r\none Summer Tillage of the Banks, the Vines having it repeated to them\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nI have, by Experience and Observation, found it to be a Rule, That long\r\nTap-rooted Plants, as Clover and St. Foin, will not succeed immediately\r\nafter those of their own or any other Species of long Tap-roots,\r\nso well as after horizontal-rooted Plants; but, on the contrary,\r\nhorizontal will succeed those Tap-roots as well or better than they\r\nwill succeed horizontal.\r\n\r\nI confess, this Observation did, for a great while, cheat me into the\r\ncommon Belief, That different Species of Plants feed on different Food;\r\ntill I was delivered from that Error, by taking Notice, that those\r\nTap-roots would thrive exceedingly well after Turneps, which have also\r\npretty long Tap-roots, though Turneps never thrive well immediately\r\nafter Clover[210], or St. Foin: I found the true Cause of this\r\nException to that Rule to be chiefly the different Tillage[211].\r\n\r\n  [210] But when Clover has been fed by Cattle, the Ground being\r\n  good, and well tilled, Turneps may thrive immediately after Clover:\r\n  Therefore this is an Exception to the general Rule.\r\n\r\n  [211] Very mellow rich Land is so full of vegetable Food, that ’tis\r\n  an Exception to most Rules; and therefore I speak not of that.\r\n\r\nLand must be well tilled for Turneps, which also are commonly hoed;\r\nthey stand scarce ever above Three-quarters of a Year, and are then fed\r\non the Ground; and then the succeeding Crop of Corn has, by that means,\r\nthe Benefit of twice as much Tillage from the Hoe, as otherwise would\r\nbe given to it; and the Broad Clover, or St. Foin, sown with the Corn\r\n(if the Corn be not so big as to kill it), will enjoy, in its Turn, a\r\nProportion of the extraordinary Tillage, and of the Dung of Cattle,\r\nwhich feed the Turneps, and thrive accordingly: But Broad Clover and\r\nSt. Foin, being perennial Plants, stand on the Ground so long, that it\r\nlies several Years untilled; so that Turneps, sown immediately after\r\nthese, do fail, for want of their due Tillage, for which there is\r\nnot sufficient time, by plowing often enough; because, by the common\r\nPloughs, it requires Two or Three Years to make it fine enough for\r\nTurneps, or for a Repetition of Clover, or St. Foin, in strong or\r\nswerdy Land.\r\n\r\nAnother Reason why any Crop succeeds well after Turneps (and besides\r\ntheir being spent on the Ground where they grow) is their cold\r\nConstitution, by which they are maintained with less Food than another\r\nPlant of the same Bulk.\r\n\r\nThe _Parenchyma_, or fleshy Part of a Turnep, consisting of a watry\r\nSubstance, which cools the Vessels, whereby the Sap’s Motion is very\r\nslow, in proportion to the very low Degree of Heat it has, and sends\r\noff its Recrements in the same Proportion likewise; and therefore\r\nrequires the less of the terrene Nourishment to supply those Recrements.\r\n\r\nThis is seen, when a Bushel of Turneps, mixed with a Quantity of\r\nWheaten Flour, is made into Bread, and well baked: This Bushel of\r\nTurneps gives but few Ounces Increase in Weight, more than the same\r\nQuantity of Wheaten Flour made into Bread, and baked without any\r\nTurneps. This shews there is in a Turnep very little Earth (which is\r\nthe most permanent Substance of a Plant); the Oven discharges in Vapour\r\nnear all but the largest Vessels: Its earthly Substance being so small,\r\nis a Proof ’tis maintained by a small Quantity of Earth: and, upon\r\nthat Account also, of less Damage to the next Crop than another Plant\r\nwould be, which required more of the solid Nourishment to constitute\r\nits firmer Body, as a Charlock does; for when a Charlock comes up,\r\ncontiguous to, and at the same time with a Turnep, it does so rob the\r\nTurnep, that it attains not to be of the Weight of Five Ounces; when\r\na single Turnep, having no more Scope of Ground, and, in all respects\r\n(but the Vicinity of the Charlock), equal, weighs Five Pounds, yet that\r\nCharlock does not weigh One Pound.\r\n\r\nAnd where Three Turneps coming up, and growing thus contiguous, will\r\nweigh Four Pounds; a Charlock joined with Two or Three Turneps, all\r\ntogether, will be less than one Pound, upon no less Space of Ground.\r\n\r\nThis Observation cannot be made, except where Turneps are drilled in\r\nRows; and there ’tis easy to demonstrate, that a Charlock, during the\r\ntime of its short Life, draws much more Earth than a Turnep of equal\r\nBulk, from an equal Quantity of Ground[212].\r\n\r\n  [212] ’Tis certain that Turneps, when they stand for Seed, suck and\r\n  impoverish the Ground exceedingly: For though they are of a cold\r\n  Constitution, and consequently consume less Food than Plants of an\r\n  hotter Constitution, and of the same Bulk; yet these Seed-turneps\r\n  being of so vast a Bulk, as sometimes Eighty Quarters of their Roots\r\n  grow on an Acre, and their Stalks have been measured Seven Feet high,\r\n  and their Roots having continued at near their full Bigness for\r\n  about Ten Months together, and then carried off, they drain the Land\r\n  more than a Crop of other Vegetables of a less Bulk, and an hotter\r\n  Constitution, and which live a less time; or than Wheat, which,\r\n  though it lives as long, is very small, except in the Four last\r\n  Months.\r\n\r\nThe true Cause why Clover and St. Foin do not succeed so well after\r\ntheir own respective Species, or that of each other, as Corn, _&c._\r\ncan, is, that they take great Part of their Nourishment from below the\r\nPlough’s Reach, so as that under Earth cannot be tilled deep enough,\r\nbut the upper Part may be tilled deep enough for the horizontal Roots\r\nof Corn, _&c._ towards which, the Rotting of the Clover and St. Foin\r\nRoots, when cut off by the Plough, do not a little contribute[213];\r\nAnd there’s no doubt but that, if the under Earth could be as well\r\ntilled for the Tap-roots, as the upper Earth is for the horizontal, the\r\nTap-roots would succeed one another as well as the horizontal would\r\nsucceed them, or those of their own Species, or as the Tap-roots do the\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\n  [213] That the Rotting of vegetable Roots in the Ground doth ferment\r\n  therein, and improve it for horizontal-rooted Plants, I am convinced\r\n  by an Accident; _viz._ My Man had plowed off the Earth close to the\r\n  Rows in a Field of extraordinary large Turneps designed for Seed.\r\n  This Earth was neglected to be thrown back to the Rows, until a\r\n  severe Frost in the Winter came, and killed the Turneps; upon which,\r\n  in the Spring, the Field was sown with Barley upon the Level, with\r\n  only _once_ plowing, and that cross-ways of the Rows. The Turneps\r\n  had stood so wide asunder, that the Spot whereon each had rotted,\r\n  appeared like the Spot whereon an Horse had urined in till’d Ground,\r\n  and was of a deeper Colour, and much higher, than the Barley that\r\n  grew round those Spots; and yet none of it was poor. As the Roots\r\n  of Clover, and St. Foin, are very much less; yet the greater Number\r\n  rotting in plowed Ground must be of great Use to a following Crop of\r\n  Corn.\r\n\r\n  I will here relate Two Examples of this in St. Foin: The one is,\r\n  That a Field of Twenty-five Acres drilled with St. Foin, except\r\n  Three Acres in the Middle of it, which was, at the same time, sown\r\n  with Hop-Clover; after Eight Years the whole Field was plowed up by\r\n  a Tenant, and sown with Corn: The St. Foin had been mowed yearly,\r\n  as the Hop-Clover was not mowed at all, but fed by Horses teddered\r\n  (or staked) thereon the First and Second Years; and after that had\r\n  nothing on it but poor natural Grass.\r\n\r\n  The whole Field was managed alike, when plowed up; but the Three\r\n  Acres produced visibly worse Crops of Corn than the rest all round\r\n  it, which had produced St. Foin.\r\n\r\n  The other Example or Instance was, Where an Acre, Part of a Field,\r\n  was, by a Fancy, drilled with St. Foin in single Rows, about\r\n  Thirty-three Inches asunder, but was never hoed: After Seven Years\r\n  it was plowed up with the rest of the Field cross the Rows, and sown\r\n  with Oats upon the Back Three Months after plowing. These Rows were\r\n  as visible in the Oats, as if the St. Foin had been still remaining\r\n  there: The Oats in the Rows where the St. Foin had been, looked of\r\n  a deep green flourishing Colour, at first coming up, and until they\r\n  were about half a Foot high, and the Spaces between them looked\r\n  yellowish; but afterwards the Difference of their Colour disappeared,\r\n  all the Crop being very good. Upon this I imputed it to the Rotting\r\n  of the Roots, which by their Singleness were very large; and when the\r\n  different Colours disappeared, I suppose the Roots of all the Oats\r\n  had reached to the Benefit of the rotted Roots, which might also be\r\n  then spread farther into the Spaces; and I doubt not but that the\r\n  Rotting of Broad Clover-roots has the same Effect as of St. Foin, for\r\n  manuring of Land, especially when the Roots are large.\r\n\r\n  Some have objected against this Opinion, and say the Effect was\r\n  rather to be imputed to the Rows of St. Foin shadowing the Earth\r\n  under them, or else from their keeping the Earth under them free from\r\n  Couch-grass, of which the Intervals were full: But I think it more\r\n  probable, that the Couch-grass, having very long horizontal Roots,\r\n  might draw Nourishment from the Earth under the Rows, and from the\r\n  Intervals equally.\r\n\r\n  And as to the Shadow of the Rows, tho’, for the First and Second\r\n  Years, the St. Foin Plants were very large; yet, being afterwards,\r\n  for Five or Six Years, until plowed up, constantly fed by Cattle, and\r\n  being more sweet, was eaten very low, whilst the Couch-grass remained\r\n  intire in the Intervals, and shadowed them more than the Earth of the\r\n  Rows was shadowed by the St. Foin: Besides, the rotten Turneps, which\r\n  were freed from both these Objections, had the same Effect on the\r\n  Barley, as the St. Foin had on the Oats.\r\n\r\nThe under Earth, in some time, is replenished by what the Rains leave,\r\nwhen they sink through it; and then Tap-rooted Plants may be there\r\nnourished again, tho’ the upper Earth be drained by the Corn; so that\r\nno Change is so beneficial, as that betwixt Tap-rooted Plants, and\r\nthose which have only horizontal ones. The former are provided for by\r\nRains, though not so speedily as the latter are by Tillage and Hoeing.\r\n\r\nPastures require no Change of Herbs; because they have annually the\r\nsame Supply of Food from the Dunging of Cattle that feed on them, and\r\nfrom the Benefit of the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nMeadows hold out without Change of Species of Grass, tho’ a Crop be\r\ncarried off every Year; the Richness of that Soil, with the Help of the\r\nAtmosphere, Dung of Cattle in feeding the After-Crop, or else Flooding,\r\nfrom the overflowing of some River, some, or all of which, supply the\r\nPlace of the Plough to a Meadow.\r\n\r\nWoods also hold out beyond Memory or Tradition, without changing Sorts\r\nof Trees; and this by the Leaves, and perhaps old Wood, rotting on the\r\nSoil annually, which operate as a Manure; because, as has been said,\r\nEarth which has once passed any Vessels, is so changed, that, for a\r\nlong time after, it does not retain its Homogeneity[214] so much as\r\nto mix with pure Earth, without fermenting; and by the Descent of the\r\nAtmosphere, the Trees shadowing the Soil, to prevent the Re-ascent\r\nof what that brings down; all this, resembling Tillage, continually\r\ndivides the Soil, and renews the Food equal to the Consumption of it\r\nmade by the Wood.\r\n\r\n  [214] Not that the Particles of Earth are strictly homogeneous, but\r\n  that they are much less heterogeneous, before they are altered by\r\n  Vessels, than afterwards.\r\n\r\nAnd the last Argument I shall attempt to bring for Confirmation of\r\nall I have advanced, is that which proves both the Truth and Use of\r\nthe rest; _viz._ That when any Sort of Vegetable, by the due Degrees\r\nof Heat and Moisture it requires, is agreeable to a Soil, it may, by\r\nthe new Horse-hoeing Husbandry, be continued without ever changing the\r\nSpecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n_Of Change of_ INDIVIDUALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeds, in their natural Climate, do not degenerate, unless Culture has\r\nimproved them; and then, upon Omission of that Culture, they return to\r\ntheir first natural State.\r\n\r\nAs the Benefit of changing of Species of Seeds is from Difference of\r\nTillage, so the Benefit of changing Individuals of the same Species\r\nappears to be from those Causes which are, generally, themselves, the\r\nEffects of different Climates, such as Heat and Moisture, which may\r\nalso vary very much in the same Latitude and Neighbourhood; as the\r\nsame Mountain in the Country of the _Mogul_ (related by Mr. _Evelyn_,\r\nfrom Monsieur _Bernier_), on the South Side produces _Indian_ Plants,\r\nand on the North Side _European_ Plants, from different Exposures; and\r\nsome Land, retaining Water longer, is colder; some, suffering it to\r\npass down quicker, and by the Nature and Figure of its Parts, causes\r\nsuch a Refraction and Reflexion of the Sun’s Rays, which give a great\r\nWarmth, as in Sand, and gravelly Grounds, that are well situate, and\r\nhave an under Stratum of some Sort of hollow Matter, next under the\r\nStaple[215], or upper Stratum, wherein the Plough is exercised.\r\n\r\n  [215] This hollow Matter lets the Water pass down the sooner from\r\n  the Surface, whereby the Staple or the Ground becomes the drier, and\r\n  consequently warmer.\r\n\r\nThis beneficial Change of Individuals seems rather to be from the\r\nforementioned Causes, than from Change of Food; and these Causes shew\r\ntheir Efficacy, chiefly in the Generation or Fœtation of those Seeds;\r\nas Flax-seed brought from _Holland_, and sown here, will bring as fine\r\nFlax as there; but the very next Generation of it coarser, and so\r\ndegenerating gradually, after Two or Three Descents, becomes no better\r\nthan the common ordinary Sort; yet its Food is the same, when the Flax\r\nis fine, as when ’tis coarse.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is, when Individuals of Wheat are changed: So Silk-worms,\r\nhatched and bred in _France_, of Eggs or Seed brought from _Italy_,\r\nwill make as fine Silk as the _Italian_; but the Eggs of these laid in\r\n_France_ and their Issue, will make no better Silk than the _French_;\r\nthough their Food be from Leaves of the same Mulberry-trees, when they\r\nmake fine Silk and coarse: Therefore ’tis from the Climate, where the\r\nEggs are impregnated, not where they have their Incubation or Food,\r\nwhen hatched, and fed to their Lives End, that this Difference happens.\r\n\r\nCommon Barley, sown once in the burning Sand at _Patney_ in\r\n_Wiltshire_, will, for many Years after, if sown on indifferent warm\r\nGround, be ripe Two or Three Weeks sooner than any other[216], which\r\nhas never been impregnate at _Patney_: But if sown a Degree farther\r\nNorth, on cold clayey Land, will, in Two or Three Years, lose this\r\nQuality, and become as late ripe as any other.\r\n\r\n  [216] Barley is far from being improved by becoming rath-ripe; for\r\n  it loses more good Qualities than it gets by being sown at _Patney_:\r\n  ’Tis so tender, that if it be sown early, the Frost is apt to kill\r\n  it; or if it be sown late in _May_, on the same Day, and in the same\r\n  Soil, with the same Sort of Barley that is not rath-ripe, it will be\r\n  much thinner bodied than the late-ripe; and besides, if it happens\r\n  to have any Check by Cold or Drought, it never recovers it as the\r\n  other doth, at what time soever it is sown. It is now, I am informed,\r\n  gone out of Fashion, and very few Farmers have sown it of late Years.\r\n  I know a little Parish, that, I believe, formerly lost about Two\r\n  hundred Pounds _per Ann._ by sowing rath-ripe Barley: But long and\r\n  dear Experience hath now convinced them of their Error, and obliged\r\n  them totally to disuse it.\r\n\r\nIndeed _Patney_ is far from improving the Species of Barley, except we\r\nthink it improved by becoming more weak and tender, and shorter-lived;\r\nwhich last-mentioned Quality fits it for such Countries, where the\r\nSummers are too short for other Barley to ripen.\r\n\r\nThe Grains or Seeds of Vegetables are their Eggs; and the individual\r\nPlants, immediately proceeding from them, have not only the Virtues\r\nthey received in Embryo (or rather _in plantulis_), but the Diseases\r\nalso; for when smutty Wheat is sown, unless the Year prove very\r\nfavourable, the Crop will be smutty; which is an evident Token of _mala\r\nstamina_.\r\n\r\nThe smutty Grains will not grow; for they turn to a black Powder: But\r\nwhen some of these are in a Crop, then, to be sure, many of the rest\r\nare infected; and the Disease will shew itself in the next Generation,\r\nor Descent of it, if the Year wherein ’tis planted prove a wet one.\r\n\r\nWeeds, and their Seed, in the Fields where they grow naturally, for\r\nTime immemorial, come to as great Perfection as ever, without Change of\r\nSoil.\r\n\r\nThese Weeds, with Acorns, and other Masts, Crabs, Sloes, Hips, and\r\nHaws, are thought to have been, originally, the only natural Product of\r\nour Climate: Therefore other Plants being Exotics, many of them, as to\r\ntheir Individuals, require Culture and Change of Soil, without which\r\nthey are liable more or less to degenerate.\r\n\r\nBut to say, that the Soil can cause Wheat to degenerate into Rye,\r\nor convert, Rye into Wheat, is what reflects upon the Credit of\r\n_Laurembergius_: ’Tis as easy to believe, that an Horse, by feeding in\r\na certain Pasture, will degenerate into a Bull, and in other Pasture\r\nrevert to an Horse again; these are scarce of more different Species\r\nthan Wheat and Rye are: If the different Soil of _Wittemberg_ and\r\n_Thuringia_ change one Species, they may the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n_Of_ RIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Method of plowing Land up into Ridges is a particular Sort of\r\nTillage; the chief Use of which is, the Alteration it makes in the\r\nDegrees of Heat and Moisture, being two of the grand Requisites of\r\nVegetation; for very different Degrees of these are necessary to\r\ndifferent Species of Vegetables.\r\n\r\nThose Vegetables commonly sown in our Fields, require a middle Degree\r\nof both, not being able to live on the Sides of perpendicular Walls\r\nin hot Countries, nor under Water in cold ones, neither are they\r\namphibious, but must have a Surface of Earth not cover’d, nor much\r\nsoak’d with Water, which deprives them of their necessary Degree of\r\nHeat, and causes them to languish. The Symptoms of their Disease are a\r\npale or yellow Colour in their Leaves, and a Cessation of Growth, and\r\nDeath ensues as sure as from a Dropsy.\r\n\r\nThe only Remedy to prevent this Disease in Plants is, to lay such wet\r\nLand up into Ridges, that the Water may run off into the Furrows, and\r\nbe convey’d by Ditches or Drains into some River.\r\n\r\nThe more a Soil is fill’d with Water, the less Heat it will have.\r\n\r\nThe Two Sorts of Land most liable to be overglutted with Water, are\r\nHills, whereof the _Upper Stratum_ (or Staple) is Mould lying upon a\r\n_Second Stratum_ of Clay;\r\n\r\nAnd generally all strong deep Land.\r\n\r\nHills are made wet and spewy by the Rain-water which falls thereon,\r\nand soaks into them as into other Land; but being stopp’d by the Clay\r\nlying next the Surface or Staple, cannot enter the Clay; and for want\r\nof Entrance, spreads itself upon it; and as Water naturally tends\r\ndownwards, it is by the incumbent Mould partly stopp’d in its Descent\r\nfrom the upper towards the lower Side of an Hill; and being follow’d\r\nand press’d on by more Water from above, is forced to rise up into the\r\nMould lying upon it, which it fills as a Cistern does a Fountain (or\r\n_Jet d’Eau_). The Land of such an Hill is not the less wet or spewy for\r\nbeing laid up in Ridges, if they be made from the higher to the lower\r\nPart of the Field; for the Force of the Water’s Weight continued will\r\nraise it so, as to cause it to issue out at the very Tops of those\r\nRidges; the Earth becomes a sort of Pap or Batter, and being like a\r\nQuagmire, in going over it, the Feet of Men and Cattle sink in till\r\nthey come to the Clay.\r\n\r\nThere are two Methods of draining such a wet Hill: The one is to dig\r\nmany Trenches, cross the Hill horizontally[217], and either fill them\r\nup with Stones loose or archwise, through which the Water, when it\r\nsoaks into the Trenches, may run off at one or both Ends of them into\r\nsome Ditch, which is lower, and carries it away; then they cover the\r\nTrenches with Mould, and plow over them as in dry level Ground.\r\n\r\n  [217] For if they are made with the Descent, and not across it,\r\n  then they will be parallel to the Rills of Water, that run upon the\r\n  Surface of the Clay under the Staple (or upper _Stratum_ of Mould),\r\n  and would be no more effectual for draining the Hill, than the\r\n  digging of one River parallel to another, without joining it in any\r\n  Part, would be effectual for draining the other River of its Water.\r\n\r\nThis Method has been found effectual for a time, but not of long\r\nContinuance; for the Trenches are apt to be stopp’d up, and then the\r\nSprings break out again as before: Besides, this is a very chargeable\r\nWork, and in many Places the Expence of it may almost equal the\r\nPurchase of the Land.\r\n\r\nTherefore ’tis a better Method to plow the Ridges cross the Hill almost\r\nhorizontally, that their parting Furrows, lying open, may each serve as\r\na Drain to the Ridge next below it; for when the Plough has made the\r\nBottom of these horizontal Furrows a few Inches deeper than the Surface\r\nof the Clay, the Water will run to their Ends very securely, without\r\nrising into the Mould, provided no Part of the Furrows be lower than\r\ntheir Ends.\r\n\r\nThese parting Furrows, and their Ridges, must be made more or less\r\noblique, according to the Form and Declivity of the Hill; but the more\r\nhorizontal they are, the sooner the Rain-water will run off the Lands;\r\nfor in that Case it will run to the Furrows, and reach them at right\r\nAngles, which it will not do when the Ridges (or Lands) are oblique;\r\nand therefore the Water’s Course cross the Lands will be longer[218].\r\nEvery one of these horizontal Trenches receives all the Water from\r\nthe Rills, or little Gutters, wherein the Water runs betwixt the Mould\r\nand the Clay; these are all cut off by the Trenches, which receive the\r\nWater at their upper Sides, and carry it away, as the Trunks of Lead\r\nplac’d under the Eaves of a House do carry away the Rain-water.\r\n\r\n  [218] The natural Course of Water being downwards, it would always\r\n  run by the nearest Way to the Bottom of the Hill, if nothing stopt\r\n  it; but the Water runs from an Hill in Two Manners; _viz._ Upon the\r\n  Surface of the Staple, and upon the Surface of the Clay that is under\r\n  the Staple; that which runs under keeps its strait Course from the\r\n  Top to the Bottom of an Hill, under a Ridge that is made exactly with\r\n  the Descent of the Hill, except that Part of the Water that rises\r\n  up into the Mould, and a very little that soaks into the Furrows,\r\n  for when the Furrows are not made exactly with the Descent, the more\r\n  oblique they are to the Descent, the longer will be the Water’s\r\n  Course under the Ridges; and the shorter, as they are nearer being at\r\n  Right Angles to the Descent. ’Tis also the same with the Water that\r\n  falls upon the Surface of the Ridges; for the more horizontal they\r\n  are, the shorter its Course will be from them to the Furrows, which\r\n  carry it off; and the less of the Water will sink into the Ridges,\r\n  the less oblique and the nearer to Right Angles to the Descent they\r\n  are made.\r\n\r\nIf there were no other Manner of plowing Ridges on the Sides of Hills\r\nthan what is commonly practised on the Plains, this Method of leaving\r\nopen Furrows (or Drains on Declivities) would be impracticable; because\r\nthe Plough could not turn up the Furrows against the Hill, and against\r\nthe Ridge also, from the lower Side of it: But the easy Remedy against\r\nthat Inconvenience is, to plow such Ridges in Pairs, without throwing\r\nany Earth into the Trenches, and then the Ridges will be plain a-top,\r\nand the Rain-water will run speedily downward to the next Trench, and\r\nthence to the Head-land, and so out of the Field. These Trenches will\r\nbe made, as well as kept always open, by this plowing in Pairs; and\r\nis abundantly more easy than the Way of plowing Ridges singly. This\r\nplowing in Pairs prevents also another Inconveniency, which would\r\notherwise happen to these horizontal Ridges; and that is, they being\r\nhighest in the Middle, the Rain-water could not run freely from the\r\nupper Half of a Ridge towards the next Furrow below it, but would be\r\napt to sink in there, and soak thro’ the Ridge; but when Ridges lie in\r\nPairs, the Water will run off from a whole Ridge, as well as off the\r\nlower Half of a Ridge that is plow’d singly, and highest in the Middle.\r\n\r\n_Note_, That every time of plowing, the Pairs must be changed, so that\r\nthe Furrow, which had Two Ridges turned towards it one time, must have\r\nTwo turned from it the next time: This Method keeps the Surfaces of all\r\nthe Ridges (or Lands) pretty near even[219].\r\n\r\n  [219] _Note_, This cannot be done on an Hill, whose Declivity is\r\n  so great, that the Plough is not able to turn a Furrow against it.\r\n  But in this Case, perhaps, it may be sufficient to plow the Ridges\r\n  obliquely enough for the Furrow to be turned both Ways.\r\n\r\nFarmers are at more Trouble and Pains to drown such Land (it being\r\ncommon to break their Horses Wind in plowing up Hill) than they would\r\nbe at, if they laid their Ridges in the abovesaid Manner, which\r\nwould effectually make them dry. Many hundred Acres of good Ground\r\nare spoiled; and many a good Horse, in plowing against the Hill, and\r\nagainst all Reason, Demonstration, and Experience too; which might be\r\nlearned even from the _Irish_, who drain their Bogs, and make them\r\nfruitful, whilst some _English_ bestow much Labour to drown and make\r\nbarren many of their Hills, which would more easily be made dry and\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\nI have observed, that those Places of such an Hill, that, when plowed\r\nwith the Descent, were the wettest, and never produced any thing that\r\nwas sown on them, became the very richest, when made dry by plowing\r\ncross the Descent. This shews that Water does not impoverish Land, but\r\nthe contrary; tho’, whilst it stands thereon, it prevents the Heat\r\nwhich is necessary to the Production of most Sorts of Vegetables: And\r\nwhere it runs swiftly, it carries much Earth away with it; where it\r\nruns slowly, it deposits and leaves much behind it.\r\n\r\nThough in all Places, where this Way of making the Ridges cross the\r\nDescent of Hills is practised, the Land becomes dry; yet very few\r\nFarmers will alter their old Method[220]; no, not even to try the\r\nExperiment; but still complain their Ground is so wet and spewy, that\r\nit brings them little or no Profit; and if the Year prove moist, they\r\nare great Losers by sowing it[221].\r\n\r\n  [220] But some of late are convinced, by observing that an Hill\r\n  of mine has been made dry by this means for Fourteen Years past,\r\n  which before was always more wet and spewy than any Field in the\r\n  Neighbourhood; and from the time of inclosing it out of an Heath (or\r\n  Common), and the converting it to arable, which was about Seventy\r\n  Years ago, it had been reputed as little better than barren, on\r\n  account of its Wetness; and that it has been the most profitable\r\n  Field of my Farm ever since it has been under this new Management.\r\n  I have also another Field, that lies about a Mile and an half from\r\n  me: It doth not belong to the Farm where I live, but was thrown\r\n  upon my Hands, no Tenant caring to rent it, because great Part of\r\n  it was full of Springs, and barren: This also, having been kept in\r\n  Lands plowed cross the Descent (which is but a small Declivity), is\r\n  become dry: And now the most prejudiced Farmers agree, that keeping\r\n  the Lands or Ridges of wet Ground always cross the Descent doth cure\r\n  its Spewiness. Hereupon some have attempted to put this Method in\r\n  Practice on their wet Land; and, after it has been well tilled up\r\n  Hill and down, have plowed it the last time for sowing of Wheat in\r\n  flat Lands cross the Descent; but by Mismanagement their Furrows are\r\n  higher at each End than the Middle, so that none of the Water can run\r\n  off either downwards or sideways, or any other Way.\r\n\r\n  Had the Furrows carried off the Water at both or either of their\r\n  Ends, it might have been effectual, notwithstanding the broad Lands,\r\n  because their Ground hath a much less Declivity, and is much less\r\n  spewy, than my Hill was: They will doubtless find their Mistake, and\r\n  amend it, having a Precedent before their Eyes; but if they had none\r\n  within their own Inspection, I question whether this Mismanagement\r\n  might not discourage them from prosecuting their Project any further.\r\n\r\n  [221] Remember, in making Ridges of all Sorts, and of whatsoever\r\n  Figure the Piece is, that no Ridge ought to have any more Furrows\r\n  at one End, than at the other End; for if there be, the Plough must\r\n  be turned in the Middle of the Piece, which will cause the Land to\r\n  be trodden by the Horses; but if each End have an equal Number of\r\n  Furrows, the Horses in turning will tread only upon the Head lands,\r\n  which may be plowed afterwards; or if design’d to be Horse-ho’d, the\r\n  Head-lands should be narrow, and not plowed at all.\r\n\r\nThe Benefit of laying up strong deep Land into Ridges is very great;\r\ntho’ there be no Springs in it, as are in the Hills aforementioned.\r\n\r\nThis Land, when it lies flat, and is plowed sometimes one Way,\r\nsometimes the other, by cross-plowing, retains the Rain-water a long\r\ntime soaking into it; by that Misfortune, the Plough is kept out Two\r\nor Three Weeks longer than if the same were in round Ridges; nay,\r\nsometimes its Flatness keeps it from drying till the Season of plowing,\r\nand even of sowing too, be lost.\r\n\r\nThe Reasons commonly given against such Ridges are these following.\r\n\r\n  I. _They prevent the fansied Benefit of cross-plowing._\r\n\r\n  II. _Farmers think they lose Part of their Ground, by leaving more\r\n  Furrows betwixt Ridges, than when they lay their Land flat, where the\r\n  Lands are made much larger than round Ridges can conveniently be;\r\n  and because also the Furrows betwixt Ridges must be broader, and lie\r\n  open; but the other they fill up by the Harrows._\r\n\r\nThe first of these I have already answered elsewhere, by shewing, that\r\nCross-plowing is oftener injurious than beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe Second I shall sufficiently confute, if I can make appear, that no\r\nGround is lost, but much may be gained, by Ridges.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by gaining of Ground, is the increasing of the Earth’s\r\nSurface: For if a flat Piece be plow’d up into Ridges, and if in each\r\nSixteen Feet Breadth there be an empty Furrow of Two Feet; and yet,\r\nby the Height and Roundness of the Ridges, they have Eighteen Feet of\r\nSurface capable of producing Corn, equally to Eighteen Feet whilst the\r\nPiece was flat; there will be one Eighth Part of profitable Ground or\r\nSurface gain’d, more than it had when level; and this, I believe,\r\nExperience will prove, if the thing were well examined into.\r\n\r\nBut against this Increase of profitable Ground, there is an Objection,\r\nwhich I must not call a frivolous one, in respect to the Authors who\r\nbring it; yet, I hope, the Desire of finding the Truth will justify me\r\nto examine it; and the Arguments brought to sustain it.\r\n\r\nThis Opinion of theirs is founded upon their Notion (which I think very\r\nerroneous) of the perpendicular Growth of Vegetables; and is, by Mr.\r\n_Bradley_, set in its best Light, in his _Vol._ I. _Pag._ 8. _usque ad\r\nPag._ 13. and in his Cuts, representing Three Hills; but his Arguments\r\nseem to be such as all Arguments are, which pretend to prove a thing to\r\nbe what it is not; _viz._ Sophistical ones.\r\n\r\nThe Hypothesis he endeavours to prove, is in _Pag._ 8. thus: ‘An Hill\r\nmay contain Four equal Sides, which meet in a Point at the Top; but the\r\nContents of these Four Sides can produce no more, either of Grain or\r\nTrees, than the plain Ground, upon which the Hill stands, or has at its\r\nBase: and yet, by the Measure of the Sides, we find twice the Number of\r\nAcres, Roods, and Poles, which measure in the Base, or Ground-plat; and\r\ntherefore _Page_ 9. Hills are worth no more than half their Superficial\r\nMeasure; _i. e._ Two Acres upon the Side of the Hill to pay as much as\r\none upon the Plain, provided the Soil of both is equally rich.’\r\n\r\nTo prove it, he gives an Example in _Fig._ III. of Buildings upon an\r\nHill; shewing, that the Two Sides of the Hill will only bear the same\r\nNumber of Houses, that may stand in the Line at the Base.\r\n\r\nThis is foreign to the Question, of how much Grain, or how many Trees,\r\nthe Hill will produce. For Vegetables, being fed by the Earth, require\r\nmuch more of its Surface to nourish them, than is necessary for them\r\nto stand on; but Buildings require no more of the Surface but Room\r\nto stand on: Therefore no such Argument, taken from Buildings, can be\r\napplied to Vegetables.\r\n\r\nThis Argument of Mr. _Bradley_’s gives no more Satisfaction to the\r\nQuestion about producing of Vegetables, than a Grazier would do, being\r\nasked, how many Oxen a certain Pasture-ground would maintain, if he\r\nshould answer, by satisfying you with the Number of Churches which\r\nmight stand thereon.\r\n\r\nThe like Answer, in effect, may be given to the Argument in _Fig._\r\nIV. of the Pales; only he has forgot to shew, that to mound over the\r\nHill would require double the Rails, or double the Hedge-wood (except\r\nStakes) as to mound the Base; if it did not, the Hill would be yet of\r\nthe more Value, because thereon more Surface might be fenced in at less\r\nExpence.\r\n\r\nIn his _Fig._ II. he gives no good Reason why the Hill should not bear\r\ntwice the Number of Trees as the Base can do; for there is as much\r\nRoom for Two hundred Trees on the Hill, as for One hundred on the\r\nBase, because he allows the Surface to be double to that of the Base.\r\nHe ought to measure the Distances of the Trees on the Hill, by a Line\r\nparallel to the Surface they grow on, as well as he does the Distances\r\nof those below.\r\n\r\nAnd suppose the Row at the Base, together with the Surface they grow\r\non, were rais’d up, so that it should become parallel to half the Row\r\non the Hill, would not the Trees in the Base Row be twice as near to\r\none another as the Trees in the Hill Row are? And suppose a Line had\r\nbeen ty’d from the Tops of all the lower Trees, before the Row was so\r\nrais’d up at one End, and then, after the Situation of the Row was\r\nso alter’d, if by this Line the Trees should be pull’d from being\r\nperpendicular to the Surface they grow on, and made to stand oblique to\r\nthat, and perpendicular to the Horizon, as the upper Trees are; would\r\nthe Distances of the Trees from one another be alter’d by this Change\r\nof Posture? No, for their Bottoms would be at the same Distances,\r\nbecause not removed; and their Tops, because the same Line holds them,\r\nat the same Distances in both Postures.\r\n\r\nMr. _Bradley’s_ Lines, drawn from the Trees below, which are one\r\nPerch asunder, make the Two Rows of Trees falsly seem to be at equal\r\nDistances, because these Lines are parallel to each other: But this is\r\na Deceit; for, in Truth, the Distances of the Trees are not measured\r\nby the Distances of those Lines, but by the extreme Points at the Ends\r\nof the Lines[222]; and those Two Points above, where the Lines cut\r\nthe Row obliquely, and at unequal Angles are twice as far asunder as\r\nthe endmost or extreme Points below are, where the Lines cut the Row\r\nat right Angles. Hence may be inferr’d, that there is Room for twice\r\nas many Trees to grow on the Hill as on the Base, and twice as much\r\nGrain for the same Reason; because there is twice the Surface for the\r\nRoots to spread in. And since Mr. _Bradley_ allows the Hill to contain\r\nTwo Perches to One of the Base, and the Soil of both to be of equal\r\nGoodness; and yet affirms, that the Two can produce no more of Grain\r\nor Trees than the one Perch can; I cannot see, why it should not be as\r\nreasonable to say, that Two Quarters of Oats will maintain an Horse no\r\nlonger, nor better, than One Quarter of Oats, of equal Goodness, will\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n  [222] These upper Trees are measured by the unequal Length of the\r\n  Lines, not by their parallel Distance, as the lower Trees are;\r\n  therefore his Measure is a Quibble.\r\n\r\nIn _Page_ 13. he concludes thus: ‘That Hills, in their Measure, contain\r\nonly as much profitable Land as the Plain or Plat of Ground they stand\r\nupon; and as a Proof of that, all Vegetables or Plants have an erect\r\nMethod of Growth.’\r\n\r\nThis Proof of Mr. _Bradley_’s is founded upon an Argument which has no\r\nConsequence, unless it were first proved, that the Surface of Earth\r\ncould produce and maintain as many Vegetables or Plants as could stand\r\nthereon in an erect Posture; which Supposition is as impossible, as\r\nthat half an Acre should produce and maintain an Hecatomb, without Mr.\r\n_Bradley_’s teaching Oxen to live upon Air for their Food, as he thinks\r\n_Van Helmont_’s Tree did.\r\n\r\nAll expert Husbandmen must needs be convinced, that the greatest Crop\r\nof Vegetables that ever grew, might stand in an erect Posture, upon\r\na twentieth (and I may say the Hundredth) Part of the Surface that\r\nproduced it; therefore there must be Nineteen Parts for the Roots to\r\nspread, unoccupied by the Trunks, Stems, or Stalks.\r\n\r\nAnd tho’ it be true, that an Hill will support no more of these, than\r\nits Base, when placed in an erect Posture, close together, as in a\r\nSheaf; yet this close Position is only proper for them when they are\r\ndead, and require no more Nourishment than Houses and Pales do; and\r\nconsequently require no Room but to stand on. Therefore this Argument\r\nof Mr. _Bradley_’s must not be admitted in vegetative Growth, where\r\nthere is always required Nineteen times more Room in the Surface,\r\nfor the Use of the Roots, than what the Stems, Trunks, or Stalks, do\r\npossess upon it: And the more Room there is for the Roots, the greater\r\nNumber of Plants may be produced.\r\n\r\nNeither can I admit, that all Vegetables or Plants have an erect Method\r\nof Growth; because the contrary is seen in Chamomile, and divers other\r\nVegetables, which have an horizontal Method of Growth.\r\n\r\nBut what is more material to this Purpose, to be observed, is, that all\r\nVegetables have horizontal Roots, and Roots parallel to the Earth’s\r\nSurface or Superficies; and unless those Roots have a sufficient\r\nSuperficies of Earth to range in, for Nourishment of a Plant, the Stem\r\nand Branches cannot prosper, whatever be their Method of Growth above\r\nthe Earth; and if there be not a due Quantity of Food for the Roots\r\nwithin the Earth, a very little Space may contain the external Parts of\r\nVegetables upon it.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, I think we may conclude, that Mr. _Bradley_’s\r\nHill may produce more Vegetables than the Base whereon it stands;\r\nand therefore it is of more Value than half its superficial Measure;\r\n_i. e._ Two Acres on the Hill are worth more than one Acre on the\r\nPlain, the Soil being equally rich, as he allows it to be, in his Case.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, whether Mr. _Bradley_ might not possibly be deceived in\r\nhis Opinion of the equal Richness of his Hill, and his Plain, I will\r\nnot dispute: I will only say this, that ’tis generally otherwise. But\r\nwhere a Plain is plow’d up into moderate Ridges, their Height being in\r\nproportion to the Depth of the Staple, below which the Plough must take\r\nnothing into the Ridges, the Soil is equally rich, whether it be plowed\r\nplain, or ridged up. And as the Surface is in the Ridges increased,\r\nthere is nothing in all Mr. _Bradley_’s Arguments, that shews, why that\r\nincreased Surface should not produce more Vegetables than the same\r\nEarth could do whilst it was level.\r\n\r\nThere are other Reasons why it should produce more when ridged[223],\r\nbesides the Increase of Surface; as,\r\n\r\n  I. _’Tis then more free from the Injuries of too much Water._\r\n\r\n  II. _’Tis better protected against cold Winds; because the Ridges are\r\n  a Shelter to one another._\r\n\r\n  III. _If the Surface be much exhausted, by too frequent Sowing, the\r\n  Ridges may be made just where the Furrows were, and then the Surface\r\n  will be intirely changed._\r\n\r\n  [223] To the Three we may add a Fourth Reason, _viz._ the raising the\r\n  Thickness of the Staple in the Ridges, keeping the Surface drier in\r\n  wet Weather, and moister at the Bottom of the Staple in dry Weather.\r\n  And I have seen Barley that was drilled on my raised little Ridges\r\n  flourish in a dry Summer on the Brow of my chalky Hill, and on my\r\n  lowest Land in wet Weather, when the Barley hand-sown contiguous to\r\n  it on each Side those Ridges, sown on the Level the same Day that the\r\n  Ridges were drilled, have looked yellow and sickly; and yet it is not\r\n  wet Land.\r\n\r\nThe following general Rules ought to be observed about Ridges; _viz._\r\n\r\nThat, as to their Height, regard must be had to the Nature of the Soil,\r\nin its difficult Admission of Water; for the greater that is, the\r\ngreater Declivities the Ridges should have; and then, if the Soil be\r\nnot deep, they should generally be made the narrower.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing which Mr. _Bradley_ takes no notice of; _viz._ That\r\nno more of the Rain, or other Benefits of the Atmosphere, which descend\r\nperpendicularly, can fall on an Hill, or on a Ridge, than what would\r\nfall on the Base, or Ground-plot. But ’tis probable, that more of\r\nthe fine Vapour, which swims in the Current of the Air horizontally,\r\ndoes strike and break against those Eminences, and so make an\r\nEquivalent[224], except that it runs off more quickly.\r\n\r\n  [224] But though Ridges do alter or increase the Surface, the\r\n  Quantity of Soil or Earth remaining the same as on the Level, and\r\n  of no greater Depth than can be tilled, it may produce equal Crops\r\n  of Corn with the Level, and no more; except from the Advantage the\r\n  Ridges may give it in lying drier.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all I have here said, in behalf of Ridges, I must\r\nconfess, that, for my Hoeing-Husbandry, I should prefer Land that is\r\nnaturally dry enough, without a Necessity of being laid up in any\r\nlarger or higher Ridges than what may contain Six Feet in Breadth[225],\r\nthat Size being the largest that is proper for the regular Operation of\r\nthe Horse-hoe.\r\n\r\n  [225] Since the Printing of my Essay, I find, upon Trial, that these\r\n  narrow Ridges are as effectual as any for carrying the Water off from\r\n  my clayey Hill; and that they be made much less horizontal than broad\r\n  Ridges, whereby their Furrows are the more easily turned upwards\r\n  against the Declivity.\r\n\r\n  I have not tried any narrower Ridge than that of Six Feet upon this\r\n  Hill: But I have had full Experience of Five-feet and of Four-feet\r\n  Ridges upon other Land; and find that all Sizes of these narrow\r\n  Ridges are very advantageous, even where the Crop is to be sown upon\r\n  the Level; for fewer Furrows are necessary for the Tilling of an\r\n  Acre, when ’tis kept in such Ridges, than in broad Lands; and after\r\n  wet Weather the Ridges will be fit to be plowed much sooner than\r\n  level Ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\n_Of_ Differences _between the_ Old _and the_ New Husbandry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to make a Comparison between the Hoeing-Husbandry, and the old\r\nWay, there are Four Things, whereof the Differences ought to be very\r\nwell considered.\r\n\r\n    I. _The Expence_   }\r\n   II. _The Goodness_  } of a Crop.\r\n  III. _The Certainty_ }\r\n   IV. _The Condition in which the Land is left after a Crop._\r\n\r\nThe Profit or Loss arising from Land, is not to be computed, only\r\nfrom the Value of the Crop it produces; but from its Value, after all\r\nExpences of Seed, Tillage, _&c._ are deducted.\r\n\r\nThus, when an Acre brings a Crop worth _Four Pounds_, and the Expences\r\nthereof amount to _Five Pounds_, the Owner’s Loss is _One Pound_; and\r\nwhen an Acre brings a Crop which yields _Thirty Shillings_, and the\r\nExpence amounts to no more than _Ten Shillings_, the Owner receives\r\n_One Pound_, clear Profit, from this Acre’s very small Crop, as the\r\nother loses _One Pound_ by his greater Crop.\r\n\r\n_The usual Expences of an Acre of Wheat, sown in the_ old Husbandry,\r\n_in the Country where I live, is, in some Places, for Two Bushels and\r\nan half of Seed; in other Places Four Bushels and an half; the least\r\nof these Quantities at_ Three Shillings per _Bushel, being the present\r\nPrice, is_ Seven Shillings _and_ Six-pence. _For Three Plowings,\r\nHarrowing, and Sowing_, Sixteen Shillings; _but if plow’d Four times,\r\nwhich is better_, One Pound. _For Thirty Load of Dung, to a Statute\r\nAcre, is_ Two Pounds Five Shillings. _For Carriage of the Dung,\r\naccording to the Distance, from_ Two Shillings _to_ Six-pence _the\r\nLoad_, One Shilling _being the Price most common, is_ One Pound Ten\r\nShillings. _The Price for Weeding is very uncertain; it has sometimes\r\ncost_ Twelve Shillings, _sometimes_ Two Shillings per _Acre_.\r\n\r\n                                                          _l._ _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  _In Seed and Tillage, nothing can be abated of_          01   03   06\r\n  _For the Weeding, one Year with another, is more than_   00   02   00\r\n  _For the Rent of the Year’s Fallow_                      00   10   00\r\n  _For the Dung; ’tis in some Places a little cheaper,\r\n  neither do they always lay on quite so much; therefore\r\n  abating_ 15_s._ _in that Article, we may well set Dung\r\n  and Carriage at_                                         02   10   00\r\n  _Reaping commonly_ 5_s._ _sometimes less_                00   04   06\r\n                                                           ------------\r\n                                                 _Total_   04   10   00\r\n\r\n_Folding of Land with Sheep is reckoned abundantly cheaper than\r\nCart-dung; but this is to be questioned, because much Land must lie\r\nstill for keeping a Flock (unless there be Downs); and for their whole\r\nYear’s keeping, with both Grass and Hay, there are but Three Months of\r\nthe Twelve wherein the Fold is of any considerable Value; this makes\r\nthe Price of their Manure quadruple to what it would be, if equally\r\ngood all the Year, like Cart-dung: And folding Sheep yield little\r\nProfit, besides their Dung; because the Wool of a Flock, except it be\r\na large one, will scarce pay the Shepherd and the Shearers. But there\r\nis another thing yet, which more inhances the Price of Sheep-Dung; and\r\nthat is, the dunging the Land with their Bodies, when they all die of\r\nthe Rot, which happens too frequently in many Places; and then the\r\nwhole Crop of Corn must go to purchase another Flock, which may have\r\nthe same Fate the ensuing Year, if the Summer prove wet; and so may the\r\nFarmer be served for several more successive Years, unless he should\r\nbreak, and another take his Place, or that dry Summers come in time\r\nto prevent it. To avoid this Misfortune, he would be glad to purchase\r\nCart-dung at the highest Price, for supplying the Place of his Fold;\r\nbut ’tis only near Cities, and great Towns, that a sufficient Quantity\r\ncan be procured._\r\n\r\n_But, supposing the Price of Dunging to be only Two Pounds Ten\r\nShillings, and the general Expence of an Acre of Wheat, when sown, at\r\nThree Shillings_ per _Bushel, to be Four Pounds Ten Shillings, with the\r\nYear’s Rent of the Fallow_;\r\n\r\nThe Expences of planting an Acre of Wheat in the Hoeing-Husbandry,\r\nis Three Pecks of[226] Seed, at _Three Shillings_ _per_ Bushel, is\r\n_Two Shillings_ and _Three-pence_. The whole Tillage, if done by\r\nHorses, would be _Eight Shillings_; because our Two Plowings, and Six\r\nHoeings[227], are equal to Two Plowings; the common Price whereof is\r\n_Four Shillings_ each; but this we diminish half, when done by Oxen\r\nkept on St. Foin, in this manner; _viz._ Land worth _Thirty Shillings_\r\nRent, drill’d with St. Foin, will well maintain an Ox a Year[228], and\r\nsometimes Hay will be left to pay for the Making: We cannot therefore\r\nallow more than _One Shilling_ a Week for his Work, because his Keeping\r\ncomes but to _Seven-pence_ a Week round the Year.\r\n\r\n  [226] Sometimes half a Bushel is the most just Quantity of Seed, to\r\n  drill on an Acre.\r\n\r\n  [227] But we sometimes plow our Six-feet Ridges before Drilling,\r\n  at Five or Six Furrows, which is a Furrow or Two more than I have\r\n  reckoned: But we do not always hoe Six times afterwards. But it is\r\n  better for successive Wheat-crops to bestow the Labour of as many\r\n  Hoeings as amount to three plain Plowings in a Year, it being a\r\n  greater Damage to omit one necessary Hoeing, than is the Expence of\r\n  several Hoeings.\r\n\r\n  [228] Or an Ox may be well kept Nine Months, with an Acre of\r\n  indifferent Horse-ho’d Turneps; and if we value them only at the\r\n  Expence and Rent of the Land, this will be a yet cheaper Way of\r\n  maintaining Oxen. Upon more Experience it is found, that St. Foin Hay\r\n  alone, or with a small Quantity of Turneps, is best for working Oxen\r\n  in the Winter; but a Plenty of Turneps with the same Hay is better\r\n  for fatting Oxen that do not work.\r\n\r\nIn plain Plowing, Six Feet contains Eight Furrows; but we plow a\r\nSix-feet Ridge at Four Furrows, because in this there are Two Furrows\r\ncover’d in the Middle of it, and one on each Side of it lies open. Now\r\nwhat we call one Hoeing, is only Two Furrows of this Ridge, which is\r\nequal to a Fourth Part of one plain Plowing; so that the Hoeing of Four\r\nAcres requires an equal Number of Furrows with one Acre that is plow’d\r\nplain, and equal Time to do it in (except that the Land, that is kept\r\nin Hoeing, works much easier than that which is not).\r\n\r\nAll the Tillage we ever bestow upon a Crop of Wheat that follows a ho’d\r\nCrop, is equal to Eight Hoeings[229]; Two of which may require Four\r\nOxen each, One of them Three Oxen, and the other Five Hoeings Two Oxen\r\neach. However, allow Three Oxen to each single Hoeing, taking them all\r\none with another, which is Three Oxen more than it comes to in the\r\nWhole.\r\n\r\n  [229] But the Number of Oxen required will be according to their\r\n  Bigness and Strength, and to the Depth and Strength of the Soil,\r\n  which also will be the easier Draught for the Oxen, the oftener the\r\n  Intervals are hoed.\r\n\r\nBegin at Five in the Morning, and in about Six Hours you may hoe Three\r\nAcres, being equal in Furrows to Three Rood; _i. e._ Three Quarters of\r\nan Acre. Then turn the Oxen to Grass, and after resting, eating, and\r\ndrinking, Two Hours and an half, with another Set of Oxen begin Hoeing\r\nagain; and by or before half an Hour after Seven at Night, another like\r\nQuantity may be ho’d. These are the Hours the Statute has appointed all\r\nLabourers to work, during the Summer Half-year.\r\n\r\nTo hoe these Six Acres a Day, each Set of Oxen draw the Plough only\r\nEight Miles and a Quarter, which they may very well do in Five Hours;\r\nand then the Holder and Driver will be at their Work of Plowing Ten\r\nHours, and will have Four Hours and an half to rest, _&c._\r\n\r\nThe Expence then of hoeing Six Acres in a Day, in this manner, may be\r\naccounted, at _One Shilling_ the Man that holds the Plough, _Six-pence_\r\nthe Boy that drives the Plough, _One Shilling_ for the Six Oxen, and\r\n_Six-pence_ for keeping the Tackle in Repair. The whole Sum for hoeing\r\nthese Six Acres is _Three Shillings_, being _Six-pence_ _per_ Acre[230].\r\n\r\n  [230] But where there is not the Convenience of keeping Oxen, the\r\n  Price of Hoeing with Horses is One Shilling each time.\r\n\r\n  When a Roller is used, which is less than a Hoeing, because one\r\n  Person to lead is enough, and that may be a Boy; and once in an\r\n  interval may suffice; then ’tis less Labour than half a Hoeing; and\r\n  for this we may well abate One Hoeing of the Eight.\r\n\r\nThey who follow the old Husbandry cannot keep Oxen so cheap, because\r\nthey can do nothing without the Fold, and Store-sheep will spoil the\r\nSt. Foin. They may almost as well keep Foxes and Geese together, as\r\nStore-sheep and good St. Foin. Besides, the sowed St. Foin cost Ten\r\ntimes as much the Planting as drill’d St. Foin does, and must be\r\nfrequently manured, or else it will soon decay; especially upon all\r\nsorts of chalky Land, whereon ’tis most commonly sown.\r\n\r\nThe Expence of drilling cannot be much; for as we can hoe Six Acres a\r\nDay, at Two Furrows on each Six-feet Ridge, so we may drill Twenty-four\r\nAcres a Day, with a Drill that plants Two of those Ridges at once; and\r\nthis we may reckon a _Peny Half-peny_ an Acre. But because we find it\r\nless Trouble to drill single Ridges, we will set the Drilling, at most,\r\n_Six-pence_ _per_ Acre.\r\n\r\nAs every successive Crop (if well managed) is more free from Weeds than\r\nthe preceding Crop; I will set it all together at _Six-pence_[231] an\r\nAcre for Weeding[232].\r\n\r\n  [231] This is when the Land has been well cleansed of Weeds in the\r\n  preceding Crop, or Fallow, or both.\r\n\r\n  [232] This may be enough, if the Land be well cleansed the Year\r\n  before, and considering that several Years in such there is no\r\n  Occasion for Weeding at all: And as this Calculation is comparative\r\n  with the old Way, we should examine the Price of weeding the sown\r\n  Corn, which by the best Information I can get, was in the Year 1735.\r\n  about 4_s._ _per_ Acre for Weeding of Barley; and of Wheat, round\r\n  about where I live, about 6_s._ and in _Wiltshire_, 15_s._ _per_ Acre\r\n  for their Wheat, amongst which much Damage is done by the Weeder’s\r\n  Feet, and yet some Weeds are left.\r\n\r\nFor a Boy or a Woman to follow the Hoe-plough, to uncover the young\r\nWheat, when any Clods of Earth happen to fall on it, for which Trouble\r\nthere is seldom necessary above once[233] to a Crop, _Two-pence_ an\r\nAcre. _One Peny_ is too much for Brine and Lime for an Acre.\r\n\r\n  [233] But this Expence being so small, ’tis better that a Person\r\n  should follow at every Hoeing, where we suspect, that any Damage may\r\n  happen from any Earth’s falling on, or pressing too hard against some\r\n  of the Plants.\r\n\r\nReaping this Wheat is not worth above half as much as the Reaping of\r\na sown Crop of equal Value; because the drill’d standing upon about a\r\nSixth Part of the Ground, a Reaper may cut almost as much of the Row at\r\none Stroke, as he could at Six, if the same stood dispersed all over\r\nthe Ground, as the sowed does; and because he who reaps sowed Wheat,\r\nmust reap the Weeds along with the Wheat; but the drilled has no Weeds;\r\nand besides, there go a greater Quantity of Straw, and more Sheaves,\r\nto a Bushel of the sowed, than of the drilled[234]. And since some\r\nHundred Acres of drilled Wheat have been reaped at _Two Shillings_ and\r\n_Six-pence_ _per_ Acre, I will count that to be the Price.\r\n\r\n  [234] One Sheaf of the latter will yield more Wheat than Two of the\r\n  former of equal Diameter.\r\n\r\n_The whole_ Expence _of an Acre of drilled Wheat_.\r\n\r\n                                                          _l._ _s._ _d._\r\n  For Seed                                                   00  02  03\r\n  For Tillage                                                00  04  00\r\n  For Drilling                                               00  00  06\r\n  For Weeding                                                00  00  06\r\n  For Uncovering                                             00  00  02\r\n  For Brine and Lime                                         00  00  01\r\n  For Reaping                                                00  02  06\r\n                                                             ----------\r\n                                                     Total   00  10  00\r\n                                                             ----------\r\n  The Expence of an Acre of sowed Wheat is                   04  00  00\r\n  To which must be added, for the Year’s Rent of the Fallow  00  10  00\r\n                                                             ----------\r\n                                                     Total   04  10  00\r\n\r\nIf I have reckoned the Expence of the drilled at the lowest Price, to\r\nbring it to an even Sum; I have also abated in the other more than the\r\nwhole Expence of the drilled amounts unto.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the Expence of a drilled Crop of Wheat is but the Ninth Part\r\nof the Expence of a Crop sown in the common Manner.\r\n\r\n’Tis also some Advantage, that less Stock is required where no\r\nStore-sheep are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Of the different Goodness of a Crop._\r\n\r\nThe Goodness of a Crop consists in the Quality of it, as well as the\r\nQuantity; and Wheat being the most useful Grain, a Crop of this is\r\nbetter than a Crop of any other Corn, and the ho’d Wheat has larger\r\nEars (and a fuller Body) than sow’d Wheat. We can have more of it,\r\nbecause the same Land will produce it every Year, and even Land, which,\r\nby the Old Husbandry, would not be made to bear Wheat at all: So that,\r\nin many Places, the New Husbandry can raise Ten Acres of Wheat for One\r\nthat the Old can do: because where Land is poor, they sow but a Tenth\r\nPart of it with Wheat.\r\n\r\nWe do not pretend, that we have always greater Crops, or so great as\r\nsome sown Crops are, especially if those mention’d by Mr. _Houghton_ be\r\nnot mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Produce I ever had from a single Yard in Length of a\r\ndouble Row, was Eighteen Ounces: The Partition of this being Six\r\nInches, and the Interval Thirty Inches, was, by Computation, Ten\r\nQuarters (or Eighty Bushels) to an Acre.\r\n\r\nI had also Twenty Ounces to a like Yard of a Third successive Crop of\r\nWheat; but this being a treble Row, and the Partitions and Interval\r\nbeing wider, and supposed to be in all Six Feet, was computed to Six\r\nQuarters to an Acre. And if these Rows had been better order’d than\r\nthey were, and the Earth richer, and more pulveriz’d, more Stalks would\r\nhave tillered out, and more Ears would have attained their full Size,\r\nand have equall’d the best, which must have made a much greater Crop\r\nthan either of these were.\r\n\r\nBut to compare the different Profit, we may proceed thus: The Rent and\r\nExpence of a drill’d Acre being One Pound, and of a sow’d Acre Five\r\nPounds; One Quarter of Corn, produced by the drill’d, bears an equal\r\nProportion in Profit to the One Pound, as Five Quarters, produced by\r\nthe other, do to the Five Pounds. As suppose it be of Wheat, at Two\r\nShillings and Six-pence a Bushel, there is neither Gain nor Loss in\r\nthe one nor the other Acre, though the former yield but One Quarter,\r\nand the other Five; but if the drill’d Acre yield Two Quarters, and\r\nthe sow’d Acre Four Quarters at the same Price, the drill’d brings the\r\nFarmer One Pound clear Profit, and the sown, by its Four Quarters,\r\nbrings the other One Pound Loss. Likewise suppose the drilling Farmer\r\nto have his Five Pounds laid out on Five Acres of Wheat, and the other\r\nto have his Five Pounds laid put on One dung’d Acre; then let the Wheat\r\nthey produce be at what Price it will, if the Five Acres have an equal\r\nCrop to the one Acre, the Gain or Loss must be equal: But when Wheat is\r\ncheap, as we say it is when sold at Two and Six-pence a Bushel, then if\r\nthe Farmer, who follows the old Method, has Five Quarters on his Acre,\r\nhe must sell it all to pay his Rent and Expence; but the other having\r\nFive Quarters on each of his Five Acres, the Crop of One of them will\r\npay the Rent and Expence of all his Five Acres[235], and he may keep\r\nthe remaining Twenty Quarters, till he can sell them at Five Shillings\r\na Bushel, which amounts to Forty Pounds, wherewith he may be able to\r\nbuy Four of his Five Acres at Twenty Years Purchase, out of One Year’s\r\nCrop, whilst the Farmer who pursues the old Method, must be content\r\nto have only his Labour for his Travel; or if he pretends to keep his\r\nWheat till he sells it at Five Shillings a Bushel, he commonly runs in\r\nDebt to his Neighbours, and in Arrear of his Rent; and if the Markets\r\ndo not rise in time, or if his Crops fail in the Interim, his Landlord\r\nseizes on his Stock, and then he knows not how it may be sold; Actions\r\nare brought against him; the Bailiffs and Attorneys pull him to Pieces;\r\nand then he is undone[236].\r\n\r\n  [235] Or suppose a drill’d Acre to produce no more than One Third\r\n  of the sow’d Acre’s Crop, whose Expence is Five times as much as\r\n  of the drill’d, ’tis much more profitable, because a Third of Five\r\n  Pounds is One Pound Thirteen and Four-pence; and a Fifth of the Rent\r\n  and Expence being only One Pound, such drill’d Acre pays the Owner\r\n  Thirteen and Four-pence more Profit, than the other which brings a\r\n  Crop treble to the drill’d.\r\n\r\n  [236] Tho’ only Five Acres and one Acre be put, yet we may imagine\r\n  them Two hundred and Fifty, and Fifty to enrich the one, or break the\r\n  other Farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Certainty of a Crop._\r\n\r\nThe Certainty of a Crop is much to be regarded; it being better to be\r\nsecure of a moderate Crop, than to have but a mere Hazard of a great\r\none. The Farmer who adheres to the old Method is often deceiv’d in his\r\nExpectation, when his Crop at coming into Ear is very big, as well as\r\nwhen ’tis in Danger of being too little. Our hoeing Farmer is much less\r\nliable to the Hazard of either of those Extremes; for when his Wheat\r\nis big, ’tis not apt to lodge or fall down, which Accident is usually\r\nthe utter Ruin of the other; he is free from the Causes which make the\r\ncontrary Crop too little.\r\n\r\nA very effectual Means to prevent the failing of a Crop of Wheat, is to\r\nplow the pulveriz’d Earth for Seed early, and when ’tis dry. The early\r\nSeason also is more likely to be dry than the latter Season is.\r\n\r\n  1. _The Advocate for the old Method is commonly late in his sowing;\r\n  because he can’t fallow his Ground early, for fear of killing the\r\n  Couch, and other Grass that maintains his folding Sheep, which_\r\n\r\n  2. _are so necessary to his Husbandry: And when ’tis sow’d late, it\r\n  must not be sow’d dry, for then the_\r\n\r\n  3. _Winter might kill the young Wheat. Neither can he at that time\r\n  plow dry, and sow wet, because he commonly sows under Furrow; that\r\n  is, sows the Seed first, and plows it in as fast as ’tis sown. If he_\r\n\r\n  4. _sows early (as he may if he will) in light Land, he must not sow\r\n  dry, for fear the Poppies and other Weeds should grow, and devour his\r\n  Crop; and if his_\r\n\r\n  5. _Land be strong, let it be sown early, wet or dry (tho’ wet is\r\n  worst), ’tis apt to grow so stale and hard by Spring, that his Crop\r\n  is in Danger of starving, unless the Land be very rich, or much\r\n  dung’d: and then the Winter and Spring proving kind, it may not be in\r\n  less Danger of being so big as to fall down, and be spoil’d._\r\n\r\n  6. _Another thing is, that though he had no other Impediment against\r\n  plowing dry, and sowing wet, ’tis seldom that he has time to do it\r\n  in; for he must plow all his Ground, which is Eight Furrows in Six\r\n  Feet;_\r\n\r\n  7. _and, whilst it is wet, must lie still with his Plough. When he\r\n  sows under Furrow, he fears to plow, deep, lest he bury too much of\r\n  his Seed; and if he_\r\n\r\n  8. _plows shallow, his Crop loses the Benefit of deep plowing, which\r\n  is very great. When he sows upon_\r\n\r\n  9. _Furrow (that is after ’tis plowed) he must harrow the Ground\r\n  level to cover the Seed; and that exposes the Wheat the more to the\r\n  cold Winds, and suffers the Snow to be blown off it, and the Water to\r\n  lie longer on it; all which are great Injuries to it._\r\n\r\nOur Hoeing Husbandry is different in all of the fore-mentioned\r\nParticulars.\r\n\r\n1. We can plow the Two Furrows whereon the next Crop is to stand,\r\nimmediately after the present Crop is off.\r\n\r\n2. We have no Use of the Fold; because our Ground has annually a Crop\r\ngrowing on it, and it must lie still a Year, if we would fold it, and\r\nthat Crop would be lost; and all the Good the Fold could do to the\r\nLand, would be only to help to pulverize it for one single Crop; its\r\nBenefit not lasting to the Second Year. And so we should be certain\r\nof losing one Crop for the very uncertain Hopes of procuring one the\r\nensuing Year by the Fold; when ’tis manifest by the adjoining Crops,\r\nthat we can have a much better Crop every Year, without a Fold, or any\r\nother Manure.\r\n\r\n3. We can plow dry, and drill wet, without any manner of Inconvenience.\r\n\r\n4. He fears the Weeds will grow, and destroy his Crop: We hope they\r\nwill grow, to the end we may destroy them[237].\r\n\r\n  [237] For, before they grow, they cannot be killed; but if they are\r\n  all killed as soon as they appear, there will be no Danger of their\r\n  exhausting the Land, or re-stocking it with their Seed; and ’tis\r\n  our Fault if we drill more than we can keep clean from Weeds by the\r\n  Horse-hoe, Hand-hoe, and Hands; the First for the Intervals, the\r\n  Second for the Partitions, and the Third for the Rows: By the Two\r\n  former, as soon after they appear as they can; but by the last, when\r\n  they are grown high enough to be conveniently taken hold of.\r\n\r\n5. We do not fear to plant our Wheat early (so that we plow dry),\r\nbecause we can help the Hardness or Staleness of the Land by Hoeing.\r\n\r\n6. The Two Furrows of every Ridge whereon the Rows are to be drilled,\r\nwe plow dry; and if the Weather prove wet before these are all\r\nfinished, we can plow the other Two Furrows up to them, until it be\r\ndry enough to return to our plowing the first Two Furrows; and after\r\nfinishing them, let the Weather be wet or dry, we can plow the last Two\r\nFurrows. We can plow our Two Furrows in the Fourth Part of the Time\r\nthey can plow their Eight, which they must plow dry all of them, in\r\nevery Six Feet; for they cannot plow part dry, and the rest when ’tis\r\nwet, as we can.\r\n\r\n7. We never plant our Seed under Furrow, but place it just at the Depth\r\nwhich we judge most proper; and that is pretty shallow, about Two\r\nInches deep; and then there is no Danger of burying it.\r\n\r\n8. We not only plow a deep Furrow, but also plow to the Depth of Two\r\nFurrows; that is, we trench-plow where the Land will allow it[238];\r\nand we have the greatest Convenience imaginable for doing this,\r\nbecause there are Two of our Four Furrows always lying open; and Two\r\nplowed Furrows (that is, one plowed under another) are as much more\r\nadvantageous for the nourishing a Crop, as Two Bushels of Oats are\r\nbetter than one for nourishing an Horse: Or if the Staple of the Land\r\nbe too thin or shallow, we can help it by raising the Ridges prepared\r\nfor the Rows the higher above the Level.\r\n\r\n  [238] Very little of my Land will admit the Plough to go the Depth\r\n  of Two common Furrows without reaching the Chalk; But deep Land may\r\n  be easily thus Trench-plowed with great Advantage; and even when\r\n  there is only the Depth of a single Furrow, that may sometimes be\r\n  advantageously plowed at twice.\r\n\r\n9. We also raise an high Ridge in the Middle of each Interval above the\r\nWheat before Winter, to protect it from the cold Winds, and to prevent\r\nthe Snow from being driven away by them. And the Furrows or Trenches,\r\nfrom whence the Earth of these Ridges is taken, serve to drain off the\r\nWater from the Wheat, so that, being drier, it must be warmer than the\r\nharrowed Wheat, which has neither Furrows to keep it dry, nor Ridges to\r\nshelter it[239], as every Row of ours has on both Sides of it.\r\n\r\n  [239] This is a Mistake; for the Ridges in the Middle of the\r\n  Intervals do not always, nor often in thin shallow Land lie high\r\n  enough to make a Shelter to the Rows, they being higher: But when\r\n  Wheat is drilled on the Level, ’tis sheltered by the Ridges raised in\r\n  the Intervals: But we never weed or hand-hoe Wheat before the Spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Condition in which the Land is left after a Crop._\r\n\r\nThe different Condition the Land is left in after a Crop[240], by\r\nthe one and the other Husbandry, is not less considerable than the\r\ndifferent Profit of the Crop.\r\n\r\n  [240] If indifferent Land be well pulverized by the Plough for one\r\n  whole Year, it will produce a good Crop: But then, if, instead of\r\n  being sown, it be kept pulverized on for another Year without being\r\n  exhausted by any Vegetables, it will acquire from the Atmosphere\r\n  an extraordinary great Degree of Fertility more than it had before\r\n  such Second Year’s Pulveration and Unexhaustion. This being granted,\r\n  which no Man of Experience can deny, what Reason can there be why\r\n  such a Number of Plants, competent for a profitable Crop, may not\r\n  be maintained on it the Second Year, that may keep the Degree of\r\n  their Exhaustion in _Æquilibrio_ with that Degree of Fertility,\r\n  which the same Land had acquired at the End of the First Year of\r\n  its Pulveration, the same Degree of Pulveration being continued to\r\n  it by Hoeing in the Second Year? Or why may it not produce annual\r\n  Crops always, if the same _Equilibrium_ be continually kept? Two\r\n  unanswerable Reasons may be given why this _Equilibrium_ cannot be\r\n  kept in the random Sowing, as it may in the Hoeing Method; _viz._\r\n  First, In the former, the Land is by the Number of sown Plants and\r\n  Weeds much more (we may suppose at least Five times more) exhausted:\r\n  And, Secondly, No Pulveration is continued to the Soil, whilst the\r\n  Crop is on it; which is that Part of the Year wherein is the most\r\n  proper (if not the only proper) Season for pulverizing. Therefore,\r\n  allowing, that, in the random way, a Soil cannot, for want of\r\n  Quantity of vegetable Food, continue to produce annual Crops without\r\n  Manure, or perhaps with it; yet that is no Reason why it may not\r\n  produce them in the Hoeing Culture duly performed.\r\n\r\nA Piece of Eleven Acres of a poor, thin, chalky Hill was sown with\r\nBarley in the common Manner, after a hoed Crop of Wheat; and produced\r\nfull Five Quarters and an half to each Acre (reckoning the Tythe);\r\nwhich was much more than any Land in all the Neighbourhood yielded\r\nthe same Year; tho’ some of it be so rich, as that One Acre is worth\r\nThree Acres of this Land: And no Man living can remember, that ever\r\nthis produced above half such a Crop before, even when the best of the\r\ncommon Management has been bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nA Field, that is a sort of an Heath-ground, used to bring such poor\r\nCrops of Corn, that heretofore the Parson carried away a whole Crop of\r\nOats from it, believing it had been only his Tythe. The best Management\r\nthat ever they did or could bestow upon it, was to let it rest Two\r\nor Three Years, and then fallow and dung it, and sow it with Wheat,\r\nnext to that with Barley and Clover, and then let it rest again; but\r\nI cannot hear of any good Crop that it ever produced by this or any\r\nother of their Methods; ’twas still reckoned so poor, that nobody cared\r\nto rent it. They said Dung and Labour were thrown away upon it, then\r\nimmediately after Two sown Crops of black Oats had been taken off it,\r\nthe last of which was scarce worth the mowing, it was put into the\r\nHoeing Management; and when Three hoed Crops[241] had been taken from\r\nit, it was sown with Barley, and brought a very good Crop, much better\r\nthan ever it was known to yield before; and then a good Crop of hoed\r\nWheat succeeded the Barley, and then it was again sown with Barley,\r\nupon the Wheat-stubble; and that also was better than the Barley it\r\nused to produce.\r\n\r\n  [241] These Three hoed Crops were of Turneps and Potatoes.\r\n\r\nNow all the Farmers of the Neighbourhood affirm, that it is impossible\r\nbut that this must be very rich Ground, because they have seen it\r\nproduce Six Crops in Six Years, without Dung or Fallow, and never\r\none of them fail. But, alas! this different Reputation they give to\r\nthe Land, does not at all belong to it, but to the different Sorts\r\nof Husbandry; for the Nature of it cannot be altered but by that,\r\nthe Crops being all carried off it, and nothing added to supply the\r\nSubstance those Crops take from it, except (what Mr. _Evelyn_ calls)\r\nthe celestial Influences; and that these are received by the Earth, in\r\nproportion to the Degrees of its Pulveration.\r\n\r\nA Field was drilled with Barley after an hoed Crop; and another\r\nadjoining to it on the same Side of the same poor Hill, and exactly the\r\nsame Sort of Land, was drilled with Barley also, Part of it after the\r\nsown Crop, the same Day with the other; there was only this Difference\r\nin the Soil, that the former of these had no manner of Compost on it\r\nfor many Years before, and the latter was dunged the Year before:\r\nYet its Crop was not near so good as that which followed the hoed\r\nCrop[242]; tho’ the latter had twice the Plowing that the former had\r\nbefore drilling, and the same Hoeings afterwards; _viz._ Each was hoed\r\nThree times.\r\n\r\n  [242] This was a Wheat Crop, and often well hoed.\r\n\r\nA Field of about Seventeen Acres was Summer-fallowed, and drilled with\r\nWheat; and with the Hoeing brought a very good Crop (except Part of\r\nit, which being eaten by trespassing Sheep in the Winter, was somewhat\r\nblighted); the _Michaelmas_ after that was taken off, the same Field\r\nwas drilled again with Wheat, upon the Stubble of the former, and\r\nhoed: This Second Crop was a good one, scarce any in the Neighbourhood\r\nbetter. A Piece of Wheat adjoining to it, on the very same Sort of Land\r\n(except that this latter was always reckoned better, being thicker in\r\nMould above the Chalk), sown at the same time on dunged Fallows, and\r\nthe Ground always dunged once in Three Years; yet this Crop failed\r\nso much, as to be judged, by some Farmers, not to exceed the Tythe\r\nof the other: That the hoed Field has received no Dung or Manure for\r\nmany Years past, is because it lies out of the Reach for carrying of\r\nCart-Dung, and no Fold being kept on my Farm: But I cannot say, I think\r\nthere was quite so much Odds betwixt this Second undunged hoed Crop\r\nand the sown; yet this is certain, that the former is a good, and the\r\nlatter a very bad Crop.\r\n\r\nI could give many more Instances of the same Kind, where hoed Crops\r\nand sown Crops have succeeded better after hoed Crops than after\r\nsown Crops, and never yet have seen the contrary; and therefore am\r\nconvinced, that the Hoeing[243] (if it be duly performed) enriches\r\nthe Soil more than Dung and Fallows, and leaves the Land in a much\r\nbetter Condition for a succeeding Crop. The Reason I take to be very\r\nobvious: The artificial Pasture of Plants is made and increased by\r\nPulveration only; and nothing else there is in our Power to enrich our\r\nGround, but to pulverize it[244], and keep it from being exhausted\r\nby Vegetables[245]. Superinductions of Earth are an Addition of\r\nmore Ground, or changing it, and are more properly purchasing than\r\ncultivating.\r\n\r\n  [243] This is more especially meant of Fallows in the common\r\n  Husbandry, and a moderate Quantity of common Dung, or the Fold: And\r\n  there may be such a poor Sand, or other barrenish Soil, so subject\r\n  to Constipation in the Winter, as to require Dung when planted with\r\n  Wheat, there being no general Rule without Exceptions; and ’tis\r\n  impossible for me to know the Number of these Exceptions. Well it is\r\n  for the Hoer, whose Land is of such a kind, that he can keep it in\r\n  Heart without Dung by Hoeing; for when he has no Fold, he plows his\r\n  Ground with Oxen, and plants it mostly with Wheat, the Straw whereof\r\n  being for other Uses, he can make but very little Dung.\r\n\r\n  [244] These Two are all we have in our Power; for pulverizing\r\n  includes an Exposure to the Atmosphere; without which, I think,\r\n  it cannot be reduced to Particles minute enough, or have their\r\n  Superficies so impregnated as to become a fertile Pasture for Plants.\r\n  The Experiment related by Mr. _Evelyn_ of artificial Pulveration,\r\n  seems to prove such an Exposure necessary; as also the frequent\r\n  turning (or incessantly agitating) that fine Dust for a Year, before\r\n  the barren exhausted Earth was made rich and prolific; For, besides\r\n  the Benefit of Pulveration and Impregnation, Land is more enriched\r\n  in proportion to the Time of Exposure, during which it is free\r\n  from Exhaustion, and continually receiving from the Atmosphere:\r\n  Therefore frequent Turning and Exposure are both contained in the\r\n  Words _pulverize_, _and not exhaust_; and to comply with the latter,\r\n  we should endeavour, that our Land may be never exhausted by any\r\n  other Plants than by those we would propagate, and by no more of\r\n  them neither, than what are necessary for producing a reasonable\r\n  Crop; which, upon full Trial, will be found a very small Number\r\n  in companion to those that are commonly sown; and then, if the\r\n  Supply from the Atmosphere by Help of the Pulveration exceeds the\r\n  Exhaustion, the Land will become richer, tho’ constant Crops are\r\n  produced of the same Species; as in the Vineyards; and the Soil of\r\n  these is so much improved by a bare competent Exhaustion, and the\r\n  usual Pulveration, that after producing good annual Crops without\r\n  Dung, until Age has killed the Vines, they leave the Soil better than\r\n  they found it; and better than contiguous Land of the same Sort kept\r\n  in arable Field-culture.\r\n\r\n  By Pulveration are meant all the Benefits of it that accrue to the\r\n  Pasture of Plants; and by Exhaustion, all the Injuries that can\r\n  be done to that Pasture, except Burning. And as the Benefits of\r\n  Pulveration visibly continue for several Years, so do the Injuries\r\n  of Exhaustion; which appear by the Ends of some of my Rows that have\r\n  been cleansed of Weeds in their Partitions by the Hand-hoe, and the\r\n  other Ends of the same Rows not cleansed; the Difference is visible\r\n  in the Colour of the Wheat in the Third and Fourth following Crops,\r\n  equally managed; and this is no more to be wondered at, than that Two\r\n  unequal Sums, being equally increased or diminished, should remain\r\n  unequal, until an Addition to the lesser, or a Subtraction from the\r\n  greater, be made; which, in case of the Soil, must be either by a\r\n  greater Pulveration, or a lesser Exhaustion. ’Tis by this that both\r\n  Ends of these Rows in time become equal: For tho’ Ten Plants that\r\n  produce an Ounce of Wheat, insume more _Pabulum_ than one Plant that\r\n  produces the same Quantity (the Reason for which is given in the Note\r\n  on _p._ 121.); yet a Plant that produces Six or Seven Drams, insumes\r\n  less than one that produces an Ounce; for a Plant which produces Six\r\n  Drams of Wheat cannot be a poor one, and therefore insumes no more\r\n  _Pabulum_ than in proportion to its Augment and Product. Thus the\r\n  Soil of those Ends, which, by being doubly exhausted by Weeds and\r\n  Wheat plants, was made poorer, gradually recovers an Equality with\r\n  the other Ends, by being for several Years less exhausted than the\r\n  other Ends are by larger Plants, whilst the Number of Plants, and the\r\n  Pulveration of each, are equal.\r\n\r\n  To the Reasons already given there is another to be added, why Horse\r\n  hoed Wheat exhausts the Soil less than sown Crops, where the Product\r\n  of Wheat produced by each is equal: Which Reason is, that the former\r\n  has much less Straw than the latter; as appears by the different\r\n  Quantities of Grain that a Sheaf of each of equal Diameter yields;\r\n  one of the former yielding generally double to one of the latter; for\r\n  a Sheaf of the sown has not only more small Under-ears, but also its\r\n  best Ears bear a less Proportion to their Straw than the other; for a\r\n  Straw of sown Wheat Six Feet high, I have found to have an Ear but of\r\n  half the Size of an Ear of drilled Wheat on a Stalk Five Feet high,\r\n  having measured both of them standing in the Field, and rubbed out\r\n  the Grain of them. This Difference I impute to the different Supply\r\n  of Nourishment at the time when the Ears are forming.\r\n\r\n  Thus the sown Crop exhausts a Soil much more by its greater Quantity\r\n  of Straw.\r\n\r\n  And this is one Reason why annual Crops of sown Wheat cannot succeed\r\n  as Crops of Horse hoed Wheat do. There must be Dung and Fallow to\r\n  repair the Exhaustion of the sown; neither of which are necessary for\r\n  Crops of the Horse-hoed.\r\n\r\n  [245] It may be asked, How ’tis possible that Eight Hoeings, which\r\n  are but equal, in Labour, to Two plain Plowings, should so much\r\n  exceed Three plain Plowings, as to procure as good or a better Crop\r\n  without Manure, than the common Three Plowings can do with Manure,\r\n  and enrich the Land also.\r\n\r\n  The Answer is, That each Hoeing of the Five or Six being done to\r\n  the Wheat-plants, though it does not clean plow the whole Interval\r\n  underneath, yet it changeth the whole external Superficies (or\r\n  Surface) thereof, whereby it becomes impregnate by the nitrous Air,\r\n  as much as if it were all clean plowed at the time of every Hoeing,\r\n  and the Weeds are as much stifled, or suffocated.\r\n\r\n_Their One Year’s Tillage, which is but Two Plowings before Seed-time,\r\ncommonly makes but little Dust; and that which it does make, has but\r\na short time to lie exposed for Impregnation; and after the Wheat is\r\nsown, the Land lies unmoved for near Twelve Months, all the while\r\ngradually losing its Pasture, by subsiding, and by being continually\r\nexhausted in feeding a treble Stock of Wheat-plants, and a Stock of\r\nWeeds, which are sometimes a greater Stock. This puts the Advocates for\r\nthe old Method upon a Necessity of using of Dung, which is, at best,\r\nbut a_ Succedaneum _of the Hoe; for it depends chiefly on the Weather,\r\nand other Accidents, whether it may prove sufficient by Fermentation\r\nto pulverize in the Spring, or no: And it is a Question whether it\r\nwill equal Two additional_[246] _Hoeings, or but one; tho’, as I have\r\ncomputed it, one Dunging costs the Price of One hundred Hoeings._\r\n\r\n  [246] Additional, because there must first be several Hoeings to make\r\n  our treble Row equal to an undunged Six-feet Ridge of sown Wheat.\r\n\r\nWhen they have done all they can, the Pasture they raise is generally\r\ntoo little for the Stock that is to be maintained upon it, and much\r\nthe greatest Part of the Wheat-plants are starved; for from Twenty\r\nGallons of Seed they sow on an Acre, they receive commonly no more than\r\nTwenty Bushels[247] of Wheat in their Crop, which is but an Increase\r\nof Eight Grains for one: Now, considering how many Grains there are in\r\none good Ear, and how many Ears on one Plant, we find, that there is\r\nnot One Plant in Ten that lives till Harvest, even when there has not\r\nbeen Frost in the Winter sufficient to kill any of them; or if we count\r\nthe Number of Plants that come up on a certain Measure of Ground, and\r\ncount them again in the Spring, and likewise at Harvest, we shall be\r\nsatisfied, that most or all of the Plants that are missing, could die\r\nby no other Accident than want of Nourishment.\r\n\r\n  [247] And they have oftener less than Sixteen Bushels; and in the\r\n  Harvest 1735, a substantial experienced Farmer had no more than Four\r\n  Bushels of Wheat to an Acre throughout a Field of Forty Acres, being\r\n  robbed by Poppies; and I have known a Crop that has amounted to do\r\n  more than Two Bushels to an Acre, and some Crops less, tho’ dunged\r\n  and fallowed; so that, taking the common sown Crops of Wheat one with\r\n  another, they are thought not to amount to Sixteen Bushels to an\r\n  Acre, _communibus annis_.\r\n\r\nThey are obliged to sow this great Quantity of Seed, to the end that\r\nthe Wheat, by the great Number of Plants, may be the better able to\r\ncontend with the Weeds; and yet, too often, at Harvest, we see a\r\ngreat Crop of Weeds, and very little Wheat among them. Therefore this\r\nPasture, being insufficient to maintain the present Crop, without\r\nstarving the greatest Part of its Plants, is likely to be less able\r\nto maintain a subsequent Crop, than that Pasture which is not so much\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nWhen their Crop of Wheat is much less than ours, their Vacancies, if\r\ncomputed all together, may be greater than those of our Partitions and\r\nIntervals; theirs, by being irregular, serve chiefly for the Protection\r\nof Weeds; for they cannot be plow’d out, without destroying the Corn,\r\nany more than Cannons firing at a Breach, whereon both Sides are\r\ncontending, can kill Enemies, and not Friends.\r\n\r\nTheir Plants stand on the Ground in a confused manner, like a Rabble;\r\nours like a disciplin’d Army: We make the most of our Ground; for we\r\ncan, if we please, cleanse the Partitions with a Hand-hoe[248]; and for\r\nthe rest, if the Soil be deep enough to be drill’d on the Level[249],\r\nin treble Rows, the Partitions at Six Inches[250], the Intervals Five\r\nFeet; Five Parts in Six of the whole Field may be pulveriz’d every\r\nYear, and at proper times all round the Year.\r\n\r\n  [248] Of all annual Weeds.\r\n\r\n  [249] This is only put as a Supposition; for I have for these several\r\n  Years left off drilling on the Level, and do advise against it;\r\n  because altho’ Mould should not be wanting for the Partitions in deep\r\n  rich Land, yet it is much more difficult to hoe on the Level than on\r\n  Ridges.\r\n\r\n  [250] But when it is drilled upon Ridges, the Proportion is less, by\r\n  how much the Partitions, being thicker in Mould, contain more than\r\n  a Sixth-part of the whole Six Feet of Earth, and the Proportion of\r\n  unexhausted Earth will be alter’d likewise; and I only mention these\r\n  Distances to avoid Fractions.\r\n\r\nThe Partitions being one Sixth-part for the Crop to stand on, and to be\r\nnourished in the Winter, one other Sixth-part being well pulveriz’d,\r\nmay be sufficient to nourish it from thence till Harvest[251]; the\r\nRemainder, being Two-thirds of the Whole, may be kept unexhausted, the\r\nOne-third for one Year, and the other Third of it Two Years; all kept\r\nopen for the Reception of the Benefits descending from above, during so\r\nlong a time; whilst the sowed Land is shut against them every Summer,\r\nexcept the little time in which it is fallow’d, once in Three Years,\r\nand a little, perhaps, whilst they plow it for Barley in the Winter,\r\nwhich is a Season seldom proper for pulverizing the Ground.\r\n\r\n  [251] This may be done, tho’ the Roots of a competent Number of\r\n  Plants run through the Whole, in the manner herein before explained.\r\n\r\nTheir Land must have been exhausted as well by those supernumerary\r\nPlants of Wheat, while they lived, as by those that remain for the\r\nCrop, and by the Weeds. Our Land must be much less exhausted, when it\r\nhas never above one Third-part of the Wheat-plants to nourish that they\r\nhave, and generally no Weeds; so that our ho’d Land having much more\r\nvegetable Pasture made, and continually renewed, to so much a less\r\nStock of Plants[252], must needs be left, by every Crop, in a much\r\nbetter Condition than theirs is left in by any one of their sown Crops,\r\naltho’ our Crops of Corn at Harvest be better than theirs[253].\r\n\r\n  [252] Therefore, whenever a Soil receives more Supplies of fine Earth\r\n  from the Atmosphere, than is exhausted by all the Plants that grow\r\n  in the Soil, it becomes richer; but if the contrary, then it becomes\r\n  poorer.\r\n\r\n  [253] On an undung’d low Six feet Ridge, we have Three Rows, Eight\r\n  Inches asunder, all which being equal, during the Winter, but each\r\n  of the Two outside Rows at Harvest producing Ten times as much Wheat\r\n  as the middle Row doth, all Three together produce a Quantity equal\r\n  to One-and-twenty of this middle Row. Now, supposing the Roots of\r\n  this Row not to reach through the outside Rows, so as to receive any\r\n  Benefit from the ho’d Intervals, then this Row might only be equal to\r\n  one of Nine Rows, which should have been drilled Eight Inches asunder\r\n  on this Ridge, and then our Three would only be equal to Twenty-one\r\n  of such Nine Rows. But since it can be demonstrated, that the Roots\r\n  of our middle Row do pass through both the outside Rows far into\r\n  the ho’d Intervals, we may well suppose it to be at least double to\r\n  what it would have been, if it had no Benefit from the Hoeing, and\r\n  then our Three will be equal to Forty-two of such Nine unho’d Rows.\r\n  Thus our Crop is Thirty-three in Forty-two (or almost Four Parts in\r\n  Five) increased by the Hoeing; for though many Fields of Wheat have\r\n  been drilled all over in Rows Eight Inches asunder, it never has\r\n  been judged, in Twenty Years Experience, that a Crop so planted,\r\n  though not ho’d, was, by its Evenness and Regularity, less, _cæteris\r\n  paribus_, than a Crop sown at random.\r\n\r\nThey object against us, saying, That sometimes the Hoeing makes Wheat\r\ntoo strong and gross, whereby it becomes the more liable to the\r\nBlacks (or Blight of Insects): But this is the Fault of the Hoer;\r\nfor he may choose whether he will make it too strong, because he may\r\napply his Hoeings at proper times only, and apportion the Nourishment\r\nto the Number and Bulk of his Plants. However, by this Objection\r\nthey allow, that the Hoe can give Nourishment enough, and therefore\r\nthey cannot maintain, that there is a Necessity of Dung[254] in the\r\nHoeing-Husbandry; and that, if our Crops of Wheat should happen to\r\nsuffer, by being too strong, our Loss will be less than theirs, when\r\nthat is too strong, since it will cost them Nine times our Expence to\r\nmake it so.\r\n\r\n  [254] As for the Quantity of vegetable Matter of Dung, when reduced\r\n  to Earth by Putrefaction, it is very inconsiderable, and, of many\r\n  sorts of Manure, next to nothing.\r\n\r\n  The almost only Use of all Manure is the same as of Tillage; _viz._\r\n  the Pulveration it makes by Fermentation, as Tillage doth by\r\n  Attrition or Contusion; and with these Differences, that Dung, which\r\n  is the most common Manure, is apt to increase Weeds, a Tillage (of\r\n  which Hoeing is chief) destroys them, and Manure is scanty in most\r\n  Places, but Tillage may be had every-where. Another Difference is,\r\n  the vast Disproportion of the Price of Manure and that of Tillage.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, As we have no way to enrich the Soil, but by Pulveration of\r\n  Manure, or of Instruments, or of both; so Nature has ordain’d, that\r\n  the Soil shall be exhausted by nothing, but by the Roots of Plants.\r\n\r\nA Second Objection is, That as Hoeing makes poor Land become rich\r\nenough to bear good Crops of Wheat for several Years successively,\r\nthe same must needs make very good Land become too rich for Wheat. I\r\nanswer, That if possibly it should so happen, there are Two Remedies\r\nto be used in such a Case; the one is to plant it with Beans, or some\r\nother Vegetables, which cannot be over-nourished, as Turneps, Carrots,\r\nCabbages, and such-like, which are excellent Food for fatting of\r\nCattle; or else they may make use of the other infallible Remedy, when\r\nthat rich Land, by producing Crops every Year in the Hoeing-Husbandry,\r\nis grown too vigorous and resty, they may soon take down its Mettle, by\r\nsowing it a few Years in their old Husbandry, which will fill it again\r\nwith a new Stock of Weeds, that will suck it out of Heart, and exhaust\r\nmore of its Vigour, than the Dung[255], that helps to produce them, can\r\nrestore.\r\n\r\n  [255] Dung made of the Straw of sown Corn generally abounds with the\r\n  Seed of Weeds.\r\n\r\nThere is a Third Objection, and that is, That the Benefit of some\r\nGround is lost where the Hoe-plough turns at each End of the Lands:\r\nBut this cannot be much, if any, Damage; because about Four Square\r\nPerch to a Statute Acre is sufficient for this Purpose; and that, at\r\nthe Rate of _Ten Shillings_ Rent, comes to but _Three-pence_, tho’ this\r\nvaries, according as the Piece is longer or shorter; and supposing the\r\nmost to be Eight Perch, that is but _Six-pence_ _per_ Acre; and that\r\nis not lost neither; for whether it be of natural or artificial Grass,\r\nthe Hoe-plough, in turning on it, will scratch it, and leave some Earth\r\non it, which will enrich it so much, that it may be worth its Rent for\r\nBaiting of Horses or Oxen upon it. And besides, these Ends are commonly\r\nnear Quick-hedges or Trees, which do so exhaust it, that when no Cattle\r\ncome there to manure it, ’tis not worth the Labour of plowing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n_Of_ PLOUGHS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy what means Ploughs and Tillage itself came at first to be invented\r\nis uncertain; therefore we are at Liberty to guess: And it seems\r\nmost probable, that it was, like most other Inventions, found out by\r\nAccident, and that the first Tillers or Plowers of the Ground were\r\nHogs: Men in those Days, having sufficient Leisure for Speculation,\r\nobserv’d, that when any sort of Seed happen’d to fall on a Spot of\r\nGround well routed up by the Swine (which Instinct had instructed to\r\ndig in Search of their Food), it grew and prospered much better than\r\nin the whole unbroken Turf. This Observation must naturally induce\r\nrational Creatures to the Contrivance of some Instrument, which might\r\nimitate, if not excel Brutes in this Operation of breaking and dividing\r\nthe Surface of the Earth, in order to increase and better its Product.\r\n\r\nThat some such Accident gave Men the First Hints of _original\r\nAgriculture_, may be inferr’d from the very little (or no) Probability\r\nof its being invented originally upon Arguments which might convince\r\nthe Understanding (by just Conclusions from Ideas of the Earth and\r\nVegetation) of any reasonable Grounds to hope, that the Effect of\r\nincreasing the Earth’s Produce should follow the Cause of Tillage;\r\nor, in other Words, why it should produce more when tilled than when\r\nuntilled. Therefore it is very unlikely, that Men should begin to take\r\nPains to till the Land without any Sort of Reason why they did it.\r\nAnd no such Reason could they have before the Invention, as they had\r\nafterwards: For when they accidentally saw that Effect follow that\r\nCause, then they were well convinced it did so. But tho’ this Argument,\r\n_viz._ Tillage increases the Product of the Earth, because it does, has\r\nbeen sufficient to continue the Practice of Tillage ever since; yet it\r\nis impossible for the Inventors to have had this Argument before the\r\nInvention, in case it had been invented by Men, and not fortuitously\r\ndiscover’d.\r\n\r\nHad there ever been extant any other or better Arguments, whereon this\r\nPractice, so useful to Mankind, was founded; sure, some of all the\r\ngreat and learned Authors, who have written on this Subject, would have\r\nmention’d them. Philosophers, Orators, and Poets, have treated of it\r\nin the same Theory by which it was first discover’d, and by no other;\r\n_viz._ Land produces more when tilled; and some seem to say, the more\r\nit is tilled, the more it produces. It does, because it does; not a\r\nWord of the Pasture of Plants, or any thing like it. So that all the\r\nantient _Scriptores de re rusticâ_ have done, was only to keep that\r\nTheory in the same Degree of Perfection in which the first Discoverers\r\nreceived it.\r\n\r\nThe bristled Animals broke up the Ground, because they used to find\r\ntheir Food there by digging; Men till it, because they find Tillage\r\nprocures them better Food than Acorns.\r\n\r\nThe Reasons are the same for one and the other.\r\n\r\nThese Writers, asham’d to acknowlege so noble a Discovery to be owing\r\nto so mean a Foundation, make no mention of the true Teachers, but\r\nattribute the Invention to _Ceres_, a Goddess of their own makeing;\r\nshe, as they pretend, first taught the Art of Tillage. With this\r\nFable they were so well pleased, that they never attempted to improve\r\nthat Art, lest they should derogate from the Divinity of _Ceres_, in\r\nsupposing her Invention imperfect.\r\n\r\nWith what Instrument Men first tilled the Ground we don’t know exactly;\r\nbut there may be Reasons to believe it was with the Spade, and probably\r\na wooden one, and very rough.\r\n\r\nFor whilst People liv’d on Acorns, there was no need of the Smith; such\r\nFood required no Knives for eating it, nor was it worth while to make\r\nSwords to fight for it; and without Iron the Spade could not be well\r\nhewn, or shap’d; but if it had been such as it is at present, there\r\nnever was any thing comparable to it, for the true Use of Tillage. Yet\r\nthe Spade could not make that Expedition, which was necessary when\r\nTillage became general in the Fields; and therefore in time the Spade\r\ncame wholly to be appropriate to the most perfect Sort of Tillage in\r\nthe Garden. Then the Plough supply’d the Place of the Spade in the\r\nField; and tho’ it could not (such as it was) till the Land near so\r\nwell, yet it could till ten times more of it, and with less human\r\nLabour.\r\n\r\nWhy they did not improve the Plough, so that it might also till as\r\nwell as the Spade, seems owing to their Primitive Theory, which gave\r\nno Mathematical Reason to shew wherein the true Method of Tillage did\r\nconsist; _viz._ in dividing the Earth into many Parts, to increase its\r\ninternal Superficies, which is the Pasture of Plants.\r\n\r\nThe Difference betwixt the Operation of the Spade, and that of the\r\ncommon Plough, is only this; that the former commonly divides the Soil\r\ninto smaller Pieces, and goes deeper.\r\n\r\nHow easy and natural it is to contrive a Plough that may equal the\r\nSpade, if not exceed it, in going deeper, and cutting the Soil into\r\nsmaller Pieces, than the Spade commonly does, I leave to the Judgment\r\nof those who have seen the Four-coulter’d Plough.\r\n\r\nThe Plough describ’d by _Virgil_ had no Coulter; neither do I remember\r\nto have seen any Coulter in _Italy_, or the South of _France_; and, as\r\nI have been informed, the Ploughs in _Greece_, and all the _East_, are\r\nof much the same Fashion: Neither is it practicable to use a Coulter in\r\nsuch a Plough; because the Share does not cut the Bottom of the Furrow\r\nhorizontally, but obliquely; in going one way, it turns off the Furrow\r\nto the right Hand; but in coming back, it turns it to the Left[256].\r\nTherefore, if it had a Coulter, it must have been on the wrong Side\r\nevery other Furrow: And besides, as the Handle (for it has but one)\r\nalways holds the Plough towards one Side, with the Bottom of the Share\r\ntowards the unplow’d Land, it would cause the Coulter to go much too\r\nlow when it went on the Furrow-side, and it would not touch the Ground,\r\nwhen it went on the Land-side.\r\n\r\n  [256] _Note_, This _Eastern_ Plough always goes forward, and returns\r\n  back in the same Furrow, making only one Land of a whole Field:\r\n  Though it turns its one Furrow towards the Right, and the other\r\n  towards the Left of the Holder; yet every Furrow is turned towards\r\n  the same Point of the Compass, as when we plow with a Turn-wrist\r\n  Plough.\r\n\r\n’Tis a great Mistake in those who say _Virgil_’s Plough had Two\r\nEarth-boards; for it had none at all; but the Share itself always going\r\nobliquely, served instead of an Earth-board; and the Two Ears, which\r\nwere the Corners of a Piece of Wood lying under the Share, did the\r\nOffice of Ground-wrests: This Fashion continues to this Day in those\r\nCountries, and in _Languedoc_.\r\n\r\nThis sort of Plough performs tolerably when Ground is fine, and makes\r\na shift to break up light Land; and I could never find any other Land\r\nthere; I am sure none comparable to ours for Strength: And it would be\r\nnext to impossible, to break up such as we in _England_ call strong\r\nLand with it.\r\n\r\nI do not find, that the Arable Lands about _Rome_ are ever suffered to\r\nlie still long enough to come to a Turf; but I have observed in the\r\nlow rich Lands in the _Calabria_’s, subject to the Invasions of the\r\n_Turks_, that there is Turf, and that these Ploughs go over the Land\r\nTwo or Three times before the Turf of it is all broken, tho’ the Soil\r\nbe a very mellow Sort of Garden-mould. Having no Coulters to cut it,\r\nthey break and tear Turf into little Pieces. This was done in the Month\r\nof _November_; and had I not seen Men and Oxen at the Work, or had\r\nthere been Oaks in the Place, I should rather have thought that Tillage\r\nperformed by a Race of the first Teachers of it, in muzzling Acorns,\r\nthan by Ploughs. However, the Mould being naturally very mellow,\r\nwhen the Turf is broken with shallow Plowing, they can plow deeper\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe _English_ Ploughs are very different from the _Eastern_, as in\r\ngeneral the Soil is.\r\n\r\nThese, when well made, cut off the Furrow at the Bottom horizontally;\r\nand therefore, it being as thick on the Land-side as on the\r\nFurrow-side, the Plough cannot break it off from the whole Land, at\r\nsuch a Thickness (being Six times greater than the _Eastern_ Ploughs\r\nhave to break off), and must of Necessity have a Coulter to cut it off:\r\nBy this means the Furrow is turned perfectly whole, and no Part of the\r\nTurf of it broken; and if it lie long without new turning, the Grass\r\nfrom the Edges will spread, and form a new Turf (or Swerd) on the\r\nother Side, which was the Bottom of the Furrow before turning, but is\r\nnow become the Surface of the Earth, and may soon become greener with\r\nGrass than before Plowing; and often the very Roots send up new Heads\r\nto help to stock the reversed Furrow, the former Heads being converted\r\ninto Roots, so that it is doubly cloathed and braced on both Sides, or,\r\nas it were, kay’d together, firm and solid, almost as a Plank; it may\r\nbe drawn from one Side of a Field to the other without breaking, and\r\nmight possibly be made use of, instead of _Virgil_’s _Crates Viminea_,\r\nfor harrowing or smoothing of fine-tilled Ground; but not without much\r\nTime, Labour, and Difficulty, can it be made such itself.\r\n\r\nIf you plow whole strong turfy Furrows cross-ways, as _Virgil_ directs,\r\nand as it is too commonly practised, the Coulter cannot easily cut\r\nthem, because, being loose underneath, they do not make a sufficient\r\nResistance or Pressure against its Edge, but move before it, and so are\r\napt to be drawn and driven up into Heaps, with their Surfaces lying all\r\nmanner of Ways, and situate in all manner of Postures: So the Turf,\r\nwhich is not turned, continuing in the open Air, grows on, and with its\r\nvigorous Roots holds the Earth fast together, and will not suffer the\r\nnecessary Division to be made, which would be, if the Turf were rotten,\r\nand which is the End of all Tillage, _viz._ to increase the Pasture of\r\nPlants.\r\n\r\nNext, some have vast heavy Drags, with great long Iron Tines in them;\r\nand tho’ these huge broken Pieces of Furrows, being looser than before,\r\nrequire keener Edges to cut them; yet these Drag-tines have no Edge\r\nat all, but are as blunt as the Furrows they should cut. These Drags\r\ndraw them sometimes into larger Heaps, leaving the under _Stratum_\r\nbare betwixt them, only shaking off some of their Mould in tumbling\r\nthem about, and scratching their Surfaces, without reducing them to a\r\nmoderate Fineness, until this ill-broken Land has, for above a Year,\r\nand sometimes longer, entertained Ploughs, Cattle, and Men, with a\r\nfrequent laborious Exercise, for which they are obliged to the one\r\nCoulter.\r\n\r\nIf the Soil be shallow, it may be broken up with a narrow Furrow, which\r\nwill the sooner be brought in Tilth; but if it be a deep Soil, the\r\nFurrows must be proportionably large, or else a Part of the good Mould\r\nmust be left under unmoved, and so lost; for a narrow Furrow cannot be\r\nplowed deep, because the Plough will continually slip out from the hard\r\nLand toward the Right-hand, unless the rising Furrow be of sufficient\r\nWeight to press the Plough towards the Left, and keep it in its Work:\r\nThe deeper you plow, the greater Weight is required to press it; so\r\nthat the deeper your Land is, the worse (or into the larger Furrows)\r\nmust it be broken up with one Coulter, insomuch that, if the Land be\r\nstrong (as most deep Ground in _England_ is), it is a Work of some\r\nYears to conquer it, after it has been rested. And often it happens,\r\nthat the excessive Charge of this Tillage reduces the Profit of rich\r\nLand below that of poor.\r\n\r\nThis gives an Opportunity to deceitful Servants, of imposing upon\r\ntheir ignorant Masters. They plow such deep Land with a small shallow\r\nFurrow, to the end the Turf and Furrows may be broken, and made fine\r\nthe sooner; pretending they will plow it deeper the next time (which is\r\ncalled Stirring), which these Rogues know very well cannot be done, and\r\nintend no more than that the Plough coming the easier after the Horses,\r\ntheir Coats may shine the better; and tho’ there be no Crop at Harvest,\r\nthey must have Four Meals a Day all the Year, and extravagant Wages\r\nat _Michaelmas_, or at any time of the Year, when they think fit to\r\nmisbehave themselves.\r\n\r\nThis sort of Land must not be stirred, _i. e._ plowed the Second time\r\nin wet Weather; for that will cause the Grass and Weeds to multiply,\r\nbesides the treading the Ground into hard Dabs, _&c._ And, in dry\r\nWeather, the Plough will never enter any deeper than it went the first\r\ntime; the Resistance below being so much more than the Pressure above,\r\nthe Plough will rise up continually; or, if it goes deep enough for the\r\nWeight of Earth to keep it down, another Inconvenience will follow,\r\nwhich is that mentioned by _Columella_, _Page_ 47. _Quod omnis humus,\r\nquamvis lætissima, tamen inferiorem partem jejuniorem habet, eamque\r\nattrahunt excitatæ majores glebæ; quo evenit, ut infœcundior materia\r\nmista pinguiori segetem minus uberem reddat._ The vulgar _English_\r\nPhrase is, It spaults up from below the Staple. Hence the treacherous\r\nPlowman is secure of an easy Summer’s Work, if he can persuade his\r\nMaster to suffer him to fallow the Ground with a shallow Furrow.\r\n\r\nAnother way to conquer a strong Turf is, to plow it first with a\r\nBreast-plough, very thin; and, when the Swerd is rotten, then plow it\r\nat the proper Depth: But this Method is (besides the extraordinary\r\nCharge of it) liable to other great Misfortunes. If the Turf be pared\r\nup in Winter, or early in the Spring, it is a Chance but the Rains\r\ncause it to grow stronger than before, instead of its Rotting.\r\n\r\nAnd if it be pared later, tho’ dry Weather do follow, and continue long\r\nenough to kill the Turf, yet this loses time; the Season of plowing is\r\nretarded; for all the Staple still remains untilled; and, before that\r\ncan be well done, the Year is too far spent for sowing it with Wheat,\r\nwhich is the most proper Grain for such strong Land[257]; and few will\r\nhave Patience to wait, and plow on till another Wheat-seed time. The\r\ndry Weather also, which in Summer kills the Swerd, renders the Plowing\r\nobnoxious to most or all the Evils afore-mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [257] Besides, most strong Land has Stones in it, which will not\r\n  admit the Use of the Breast-plough.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Farmer inquires concerning the Four-coulter Plough, as in the\r\nfollowing DIALOGUE.\r\n\r\nFarm. _What must we do then? Must we have recourse to the Spade for\r\nbreaking up our rich, strong, swerdy Land?_\r\n\r\n_Resp._ If you can procure Men to dig it faithfully in Pieces, not\r\nabove Two Inches and an half thick, at the Price of about Eight\r\nShillings _per_ Acre, it would do very well, and answer all the Ends\r\nof Tillage; but, tho’ you bargain with them to dig it at that Size for\r\nThree Pounds _per_ Acre, you will find, upon Examination, most of the\r\nPieces or Spits, which are dug out of your Sight, to be of twice that\r\nThickness. And no great Quantities can be this way managed, altho’ the\r\nPrice of Corn should answer such an extravagant Expence.\r\n\r\nFarm. _Since it is so difficult to bring our strong Land into Tilth,\r\nafter it has rested, that it cannot be speedily done by a Plough\r\nwithout a Coulter, or by one with a Coulter, in wet Weather or dry,\r\nnor with a Breast-plough, without a certain Expence, and an uncertain\r\nSuccess, the Spade is too chargeable a Tillage for the Field: It seems\r\nto me, upon the Whole, that we are Losers by this_ inaratæ gratia\r\nterræ, _unless we could contrive some other Method of reducing it\r\nsooner, and with less Charge, into Tilth; for I observe, that, when\r\nwe sow it upon the Back, the Corn and Grass (or Couch), coming both\r\ntogether, exhaust the Ground so much, that by that time we can (which\r\nis about Three Years) reduce the great Lumps to a tolerable Fineness,\r\nit grows full of Grass and Weeds (which we call Foul), and loses that\r\nFertility we expected it should acquire by Rest, becoming, in our\r\nTerms, both out of Tilth, and out of Heart._\r\n\r\n_Resp._ If you know all this to be true, and that without a Coulter you\r\ncannot break it up at all; and that with one Coulter you cannot any way\r\ncut the Furrow small enough, or less than Ten Inches broad; why do not\r\nyou cut it with Four Coulters, which will reduce the same Furrow into\r\nFour equal Parts, of Two Inches and an half each in Breadth, and of the\r\nDepth of the Staple, tho’ that should be Two Spit, or Sixteen Inches\r\ndeep?\r\n\r\nFarm. _How can that be done?_\r\n\r\n_Resp._ Every jot as easily as with one Coulter: For, before the Furrow\r\nis raised by the Share, it lies fast, and makes a sufficient Resistance\r\nequally against the Edges of all the Coulters; tho’, after it be raised\r\nand loose, it yields and recedes every way, except downwards; so that\r\nit cannot be cut by any Edge, but such as attacks it perpendicularly\r\nfrom above, as that of the Spade does.\r\n\r\nFarm. _This seems to me reasonable; and, having very lately heard talk\r\nof this Plough, I would gladly know more of it._\r\n\r\n_Resp._ The Furrow, being cut into Four Parts, has not only Four times\r\nthe Superficies on the Eight Sides which it would have had on Two\r\nSides; but it is also more divided cross-ways; _viz._ The Ground-wrest\r\npresses and breaks the lower (or Right-hand) Quarter; the other\r\nThree Quarters, in rising and coming over the Earth-board, must make\r\na crooked Line about a Fourth longer than the strait one they made\r\nbefore moved; therefore their Thinness not being able to hold them\r\ntogether, they are broken into many more Pieces, for want of Tenacity\r\nto extend to a longer Line, contrary to a whole Furrow, whose great\r\nBreadth enables it to stretch and extend from a shorter to a longer\r\nLine, without breaking; and, as it is turned off, the Parts are drawn\r\ntogether again by the Spring of the Turf or Swerd[258], and so remain\r\nwhole after Plowing. Thus the Four-coultered Plow can divide the\r\nSoil into above Twenty times more Parts than the common Plough; and\r\nsometimes, when the Earth is of a right Temper betwixt wet and dry, the\r\nEarth-board, in turning the Furrows off, will break them into Dust,\r\nhaving more Superficies than is made by Four common Plowings; and it is\r\nimpossible there should be any large Pieces amongst it.\r\n\r\n  [258] A swerdy Furrow cut off by only one Coulter, being whole, is\r\n  apt to stand up on its Edge, or lie hollow; and then, being open to\r\n  the Air, it does not rot; but when it is cut by several Coulters,\r\n  it has not Strength to support itself, it falls down, lies close to\r\n  the Earth under it, and, excluding the free Air from the Turf, it\r\n  soon becomes rotten. And for killing the Turf of swerdy Land is the\r\n  chief Use of the Four-coultered Plough: For doing of which there is\r\n  this Advantage, that as in a whole Furrow there are often Strings of\r\n  Couch-grass, Three or Four Feet long; but, when cut by this Plough,\r\n  there is scarce a String left of one Foot long: And these Strings\r\n  being apt to send out Roots from every Knot or Joint, the shorter\r\n  they are cut, the more they will be exposed to the Air and Sun, which\r\n  will kill them the sooner.\r\n\r\nNow, what a prodigious Advantage must the Influences of the Atmosphere\r\nhave upon these small Parts, for making a further Division of them!\r\nFrost, Water, Drought, and nitrous Air, easily penetrate to their very\r\nCenters, which cannot in the largest of them be more than one Inch and\r\na Quarter distant from their Superficies. This Advantage, with a few\r\nsubsequent common Plowings, performed in proper Seasons, resolves the\r\nEarth almost all to a Powder. The Swerd, some being immersed or buried\r\nand mixed among so great a Proportion of Mould, is soon rotten and\r\nlost; some of the Swerd lying loose a-top, the Earth presently drops\r\nout of it; and then the Roots are dried up, and die. Thus is the whole\r\nStaple of the Ground brought into perfect Tilth in a very short time\r\nbeyond what the Spade ever does in such swerdy Land.\r\n\r\nFarm. _What sort of Weather is best for using this Plough?_\r\n\r\n_Resp._ Any Weather, except the Ground be so dry and hard that the\r\nPlough cannot enter it; but it is very proper to be done, when the\r\nEarth is so wet, that by no means it ought to be plowed with any other\r\nPlough; for it never can be too moist for this, unless the Cattle which\r\ndraw it be mired; because, tho’ all the Cattle should not go in the\r\nFurrow, yet their Treadings are cut so small by the Coulters, that the\r\nEarth is not kept from dissolving, as when turned off whole in common\r\nTillage. ’Tis observed, that the Incisions made by the Coulters on\r\nswerdy Land, will not heal, or so close up, but that they will open\r\nagain by the next Plowing, though it be a great while after. A Farmer\r\nwho uses this Plough, may till in all Weathers and all Seasons of\r\nthe Year, either in fallowing with this, which is best in wet, or in\r\nstirring with the common ones, which must be done in dry Weather; and\r\nwhen the Ground is broken up with this, it may be stirred in the driest\r\nWeather that can be, without the Danger of tearing (or spaulting) up of\r\nthe under _Stratum_ along with the Staple, because this is all broken\r\nbefore, and then no more can rise with it; as it does to the Ruin of\r\nthe Soil, when in common Tillage they go deeper the Second time than\r\nthe First: Also, if there be a Necessity of stirring some sort of Land\r\nwhen it is wet, it ought either to be done with this Plough, or else\r\nwith a common one drawn by a single Row of Cattle treading all in the\r\nFurrow; for tho’ some Land be very fine, yet, when plowed by a double\r\nRow of Cattle in wet Weather, it will be made into large Pieces by the\r\nTreading, and perhaps not dissolve again in a long time: Therefore it\r\nis better to be prevented.\r\n\r\nFarm. _I perceive this Plough lays the Foundation for all good\r\nHusbandry; and there can be no other way to bring Land into perfect\r\nTilth in so short a Time, or with so little Expence. And I am\r\nconvinc’d, that no Farmer ought to be without it, who desires to be\r\nfree from the Danger of his Land being ever out of Tilth: But I have\r\nheard it objected, that it is harder to draw than the common Ploughs;\r\nand that its Beam being longer, upon account of the Four Coulters, it\r\nlies farther behind, and comes harder after the Horses._\r\n\r\n_Resp._ I must confess, there is something in that Objection; for this\r\nPlough, being something longer, may be a little the harder Draught;\r\nand also its Weight and Strength must bear a Proportion to the Length\r\nof it. But this small Increase of the Draught would have been a much\r\nstronger (if not a fatal) Objection, had that Custom been general, of\r\nHorses drawing by their Tails, as ’tis said to have been formerly in\r\nsome Places; for then, perhaps, a sufficient Strength of Horses could\r\nnot be applied to the Plough. But in Countries where Traces are in\r\nUse, every Horse of the Team may draw the Plough equally, and then\r\nthere will be no other Inconvenience, besides the adding one Horse,\r\nor keeping a stronger Team: And he cannot be wise, who would lose the\r\nProfit of his Land, for the Odds of sometimes adding a Horse to his\r\nPlough. And I am very certain, that this Plough requires a much less\r\nStrength of Cattle to draw it in moist Weather, which is the most\r\nproper to use it in, than to draw a common Plough in the same Ground,\r\nand at the same Depth, in dry Weather; and can seldom be used safely\r\nin any other. And the Vulgar, who have always a wrong Cause ready at\r\nhand to apply to every thing, impute that Draught to the Fashion of the\r\nPlough, which ought to be imputed to its going deeper; and this great\r\nDepth at which ’tis capable of plowing, _viz._ Two Spit deep, is one\r\nextraordinary Benefit of it, tho’ it may, on Occasion, go as shallow as\r\nany.\r\n\r\nThe Draught is not so much increased by adding Three Coulters, as may\r\nbe imagined; for when the Ground is moist, the Incisions are easily\r\nmade by the Edges; and when they are cut small, the Furrows rise much\r\nmore easily upon the Share and Earth-Board, than if whole.\r\n\r\nFarm. _If this Plough be so beneficial, having so many Advantages, and\r\nonly the Two Inconveniencies, one of requiring a little more Strength\r\nto draw it, and the other its being unfit for dry hard Ground, I wonder\r\nwhy it is not become more common?_\r\n\r\n_Resp._ It has been used with very great Success for these several\r\nYears last past, but never like to be common, unless it be described in\r\na more geometrical Manner, than any Plough has hitherto been; for the\r\nPlough-wrights find it difficult enough to make a common Plough with\r\none Coulter to perform as it ought, for want of the necessary Rules of\r\ntheir Art. It is upon this Account that the Two-coulter’d Ploughs are\r\nused in few Places, though they have been found of excellent Use, and\r\nhave been formerly common: But, alas! when the Makers, who by their\r\ndiligent Study and much Practice had attained the Perfection of their\r\nArt, died for want of learning to write their Rules mathematically, and\r\nshew how the mechanical Powers were applicable to them, the Art was in\r\na Manner lost, at the Death of those Artists; and then the unskilful\r\nPlough-wrights, destitute of the true Rules, were not able to make a\r\nTwo-coulter’d Plough to perform well, and then it was left off. Very\r\nlately ’tis revived, since the Three and Four-coulter’d ones have been\r\nused; from whence some have made a Shift to take the Rules of placing\r\nTwo Coulters into a Plough, and they begin to be common again; and, no\r\ndoubt, will cease again as soon as the Rules are forgot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 291_\r\n\r\n_Plate. I._\r\n\r\n_B.Cole. Delin. et Sculp._]\r\n\r\n’Tis strange that no Author should have written fully of the Fabric\r\nof Ploughs! Men of the greatest Learning have spent their Time in\r\ncontriving Instruments to measure the immense Distance of the Stars,\r\nand in finding out the Dimensions, and even Weight, of the Planets:\r\nThey think it more eligible to study the Art of plowing the Sea with\r\nShips, than of tilling the Land with Ploughs; they bestow the utmost of\r\ntheir Skill, learnedly, to pervert the natural Use of all the Elements\r\nfor Destruction of their own Species, by the bloody Art of War. Some\r\nwaste their whole Lives in studying how to arm Death with new Engines\r\nof Horror, and inventing an infinite Variety of Slaughter; but think it\r\nbeneath Men of Learning (who only are capable of doing it) to employ\r\ntheir learned Labours in the Invention of new (or even improving the\r\nold) Instruments for increasing of Bread.\r\n\r\nThe easiest Method of perpetuating the Use of the many coulter’d\r\nPloughs, and other newly-invented Instruments of Husbandry, is by\r\nModels, _i. e._ the Things themselves in little; and these may be all\r\nportable even in a Man’s Pocket: Every Part must be fully described,\r\nwith the true Dimensions, and the mathematical Reasons, on which their\r\nContrivance is founded. Directions also for using them must be given\r\nat the same time that their Manner of making is described. In some,\r\nthe very Horses which draw must be represented, to shew the manner of\r\nfixing the Horses, and the Traces: Cautions against all the Errors that\r\nmay happen by the want of Experience in the Makers or Users, must be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, and the Rules put into a Method, the new\r\nHoeing-Husbandry, in all its Branches, will be much more easy and\r\ncertain than the old; because there are no mathematical Rules extant\r\nin any Method; and a Man may practise the old random Husbandry all his\r\nLife, without attaining so much Certainty in Agriculture as may be\r\nlearned in a few Hours from such a Treatise.\r\n\r\nThe Rules, indeed, require much Labour, Study, and Experience, to\r\ncompose them; but when finish’d, will be most easy to practise: Like\r\nthe Rules for measuring Timber; their Use is, at first Sight, easy\r\nto every Carpenter, and to most Artificers who work in Wood; but no\r\nilliterate Person is able to compose those Rules, or to measure Timber\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\n_The Description of a_ Four-coulter’d Plough.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo describe all Parts of a Plough geometrically, would require more\r\nTime and Learning than I am Master of: Therefore leaving that to be\r\ndone by somebody else, who is better qualified for it, I shall at\r\npresent attempt little more than what relates to the Three added\r\nCoulters.\r\n\r\nIn _Plate_ I. _Fig._ I. is the Portrait of a common Two-wheel’d Plough\r\nused in _Berkshire_, _Hampshire_, _Oxfordshire_, and _Wiltshire_, and\r\nin most other Countries of _South-Britain_; and is generally esteemed\r\nthe best Plough for all Sorts of Land, except such miry Clays that\r\nstick to the Wheels, and clog them up, so as they cannot turn round.\r\n\r\nBut they have, in some Places, a Contrivance to prevent this\r\nInconvenience; which is done by winding Thumb-ropes of Straw about the\r\nIron Circles of the Wheels, and about the Spokes. The Wheels pressing\r\nagainst the Ground, the Thumb-ropes are distended on each Side: which\r\nMotion throws off the Dirt, and prevents its sticking to the Wheels,\r\nwhich it would otherwise do.\r\n\r\n’Tis commonly divided into Two Parts; _viz._ the Plough-head, and the\r\nPlough-tail.\r\n\r\nThe Plough-head contains the Two Wheels A, B, and their Axis or\r\nSpindle of Iron passing thro’ the Box C, turning round both therein,\r\nand in the Wheels; the Two Crow-staves D, D, fastened into the Box\r\nperpendicularly, and having in each Two Rows of Holes, whereby to raise\r\nor sink the Beam, by pinning up or down, the Pillow E, to increase\r\nor diminish the Depth of the Furrow; the Gallows F, thro’ which the\r\nCrow-staves pass at top, by Mortises, into which they are pinned; G\r\nthe Wilds with its Links and Crooks of Iron, whereby the whole Plough\r\nis drawn; H the Two-chain, which fastens the Plough-tail to the\r\nPlough-head, by the Collar I at one End, and by the other End passing\r\nthro’ a Hole in the Middle of the Box, is pinned in by the Stake K; L\r\nthe Bridle-chain, one End whereof is fastened to the Beam by a Pin, and\r\nthe other End to the Top of the Stake, which Stake is held up to the\r\nleft Crow-staff, by the With M, patting round it above, and under the\r\nEnd of the Gallows below; or instead of this With, by a Piece of Cord,\r\nand sometimes by the End of the Bridle-chain, when that is long enough.\r\n\r\nThe Plough-tail consists of the Beam N: the Coulter O; the Share P; and\r\nthe Sheat Q; the Hinder-sheat R, passing thro’ the Beam near its End;\r\nS the short Handle, fastened to the Top of the Hinder-sheat by a Pin,\r\nand to the Top of the Sheat by another Pin; T the Drock which belongs\r\nto the right Side of the Plough-tail, and whereto the Ground-wrist V\r\nis fasten’d; as is the Earth-board, whose Fore-part W is seen before\r\nthe Sheat; and also the long Handle X, whose Fore-part Y appears before\r\nthe Sheat, and is fasten’d to the Drock by a Pin at _a_, the other End\r\nof which Pin goes into the Beam. Z is the double Retch, which holds up\r\nthe Sheat, and passes through the Beam to be fasten’d by its Screws and\r\nNuts at _b_ and _c_.\r\n\r\nBut without intrenching much farther upon the common Plough-wright’s\r\nArt, whose Trade is his Living, I’ll hasten to shew the necessary\r\nDifference there is betwixt the common Plough, and the Four-coulter\r\nPlough, beginning with _Fig._ 2. where it is represented as standing\r\nupon a level Surface.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 2. And, First, The Beam differs in Length, being Ten Feet Four\r\nInches long, as the other Plough-beam is but Eight Feet; it differs in\r\nShape, as the other is strait from one End to the other, but this is\r\nstrait only from _a_ to _b_, and thence turns up of a sudden, in the\r\nmanner that is shewn in the Cut; so that a Line let down perpendicular,\r\nfrom the Corner at _a_, to the even Surface whereon the Plough stands,\r\nwould be Eleven Inches and an half, which is its Height in that Place;\r\nand, if another Line were let down, from the turning of the Beam at\r\n_b_, to the same Surface, it would be One Foot Eight Inches and an\r\nhalf, which is the Height that the Beam stands from the Ground, at that\r\nPart; and a Third Line let down to the Surface, from the Bottom of the\r\nBeam, at that Part which bears upon the Pillow, will shew the Beam to\r\nbe Two Feet Ten Inches high above the Surface in that Part.\r\n\r\nFrom the End _a_, to the Back-part of the first Coulter, is Three Feet\r\nTwo Inches; from thence, to the Back of the next Coulter, is Thirteen\r\nInches; thence to the Third, Thirteen Inches; and from thence to the\r\nFourth, the same. From _a_ to _b_ is Seven Feet.\r\n\r\nThis Crookedness of the Beam is to avoid the too great Length of the\r\nforemost Coulters, which would be necessary if the Beam was strait; and\r\nthen, unless they were vastly thick and heavy, they would be apt to\r\nbend, and the Point of the Fourth would be at so great a Distance from\r\nits Coulter-hole, that it would have the greater Power to loosen the\r\nWedges, whereby the Coulter would rise up out of its Work, as it never\r\ndoth when the Beam is made in this bending Manner. This Beam is made\r\neither of Ash, which is the lightest, or of Oak, which is the most\r\ndurable. Its Depth and Breadth may vary, according to the heavier or\r\nlighter Soil it is to till; but this before us is in Depth Five Inches\r\nat the first Coulter-hole, and in Breadth Four Inches.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 4. Is the Sheat Q in _Fig._ 1. (broad Seven Inches) with the\r\nIron Retch on it, the left Leg of which Retch must stand foremost, to\r\nthe end that the Edge of its Fore-part, that is flat, may fit close to\r\nthe Wood of the Sheat: This Retch holds the Sheat fast up to the Beam\r\nby its Nuts and Screws; as also doth a Pin driven into the Hole _a_,\r\nwhich Hole being a small Part of it within the Beam, the Pin being\r\ndriven into the Hole, draws up the Sheat very tight to the Beam. The\r\nprincipal thing to be taken notice of here, is the Angle _b c d_, which\r\nshews the Elevation of the Sheat; the Line _c d_ is supposed to be\r\nequal with the Bottom of the Share (or rather with the plain Surface\r\nwhereon it stands); when this Angle at _c_ is larger than of Forty-five\r\nDegrees, a common Plough never goes well: In my Four-coulter Plough I\r\nchoose to have it of Forty-two or Forty-three at the most.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 5. Is the Share; _a_ is the End of the Point; _b_ is the Tail of\r\nthe Share, long from _a_ to _b_ Three Feet Nine Inches; _c_ the Fin;\r\n_d_ the Socket, into which the Bottom of the Sheat enters; _e_ a thin\r\nPlate of Iron riveted to the Tail of the Share: By this Plate, the Tail\r\nof the Share is held to the hinder Sheat, as at _d_ in _Fig._ 1. by a\r\nsmall Iron Pin with a Screw at its End, and a Nut screw’d on it on the\r\ninner or right Side of that Sheat. From _a_ to _f_ is the Point, long\r\nabout Three Inches and an half, flat underneath, and round at Top: It\r\nshould be of hard Steel underneath. From _f_ to _c_ is the Edge of\r\nthe Fin, which should be well steeled; the Length of it is uncertain,\r\nbut it should never make a less Angle at _f_ than it appears to make\r\nin this _Fig._ The Socket is a Mortise of about a Foot long, at the\r\nupper Part, Two Inches deep: The Fore-end of this Mortise must not be\r\nperpendicular, but oblique, conformable to the Fore-part of the Sheat\r\nwhich enters it; the upper Edge of which Fore-part must always bear\r\nagainst the Sheat at _e_ in _Fig._ 4. but if this End of the Socket\r\nshould not be quite so oblique as the Sheat, it may be help’d, by\r\ntaking off a little of the Wood at the Point _c_.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 6. Shews the Share, with its right Side upwards, in the same\r\nPosture as when it plows; whose Side _a b_ should be perfectly strait,\r\nbut its under Side at _c_, which is its Neck, should be a little hollow\r\nfrom the Ground, but never more than half an Inch in any Plough, and a\r\nQuarter of an Inch in a Four-coulter Plough; so that the Share, when it\r\nis first made, standing upon its Bottom, bears upon the level Surface\r\nonly in Three Places; _viz._ at the very Point _a_, at the Tail _b_,\r\nand at the Corner of the Fin _d_.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. Is the Share, turn’d Bottom upwards; and shews the Concavity\r\nof the Fin at _a_; which must be greatest in a stony rubbly Soil.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. Shews the Share, the right Side upwards, but leaning towards\r\nthe Left.\r\n\r\nIn placing of the Share rightly upon the Sheat, consists the well going\r\nof a Plough, and is the most difficult Part of a Plough-wright’s Trade,\r\nand is very difficult to be shewn. Supposing the Axis of the strait\r\nBeam, and the left Side of the Share, to be both horizontal, they must\r\nnever be parallel to each other; for if they were, the Tail of the\r\nShare, bearing against the Side of the Trench, as much as the Point,\r\nwould cause the Point to incline to the right Hand, and go out of the\r\nGround into the Furrow. If the Point of the Share should be set, so\r\nthat its Side should make an Angle on the right Side of the Axis of\r\nthe Beam, this Inconvenience would be much greater; and if its Point\r\nshould incline much to the Left, and make too large an Angle on that\r\nSide with the Axis of the Beam, the Plough would run quite to the left\r\nHand; and if the Holder, to prevent its running out of the Ground,\r\nturns the upper Part of his Plough towards the left Hand, the Fin of\r\nthe Share will rise up, and cut the Furrow diagonally[259], leaving it\r\nhalf unplow’d; beside, the Plough will rise up at the Tail, and go all\r\nupon the Point of the Share: To avoid these Inconveniences, the strait\r\nSide of the Share must make an Angle on the left Side of the Beam, but\r\nso very acute, that the Tail of the Share may only press less against\r\nthe Side of the Trench than the Point does. This Angle is shewn by the\r\nprick’d Lines at the Bottom of _Fig._ 1. where the prick’d Line _e f_\r\nis supposed to be the Axis of the Beam let down to the Surface, and\r\nthe prick’d Line _g f_ parallel to the left Side of the Share; but\r\nthis Angle will vary as those Two prick’d Lines are produc’d forwards\r\nto the Fore-end of a long and a short Beam, keeping the same Subtense:\r\nFor Plough-wrights always take this Subtense at the Fore-end of a Beam,\r\nwhether it be a long Beam or short one; and it is the Subtense _e g_,\r\nthat determines the Inclination the Point of the Share must have toward\r\nthe left Hand. Plough-wrights differ much in this Matter; but, by what\r\nI can learn by those that make the Ploughs I see perform the best, this\r\nSubtense at the Fore-end of an Eight-feet Beam should never be more\r\nthan one Inch and an half; and by full Experience I find, that whether\r\nthe Beam be long or short, the Subtense must be the same; for when my\r\nPlough-wrights take this Subtense at Eight Feet from the Tail, when\r\nthey make my Four-coulter Plough, whose Beam is Ten Feet Four Inches\r\nlong, the Point of the Share will incline too much to the Left, and\r\nit will not go well until this Fault be mended, by taking the same\r\nSubtense quite at the End of the Beam; which makes the mentioned Angle\r\nmore acute.\r\n\r\n  [259] This is the greatest Misfortune incident to a common\r\n  Two-wheeled Plough, and happens generally by the Fault of the Maker,\r\n  though sometimes by the Plowman’s setting it so, that the Point of\r\n  the Share turns too much to the Left. I have seen Land plowed in this\r\n  manner, where not half of it has been moved, nor better tilled than\r\n  by Raftering, not only cut diagonally, but also half the Surface\r\n  hath remained whole, where when the Earth that was thrown on it was\r\n  removed, the Weeds appeared unhurt on the unplowed Surface. In this\r\n  Case, they for a Remedy let the Plough to go deeper; and then, if it\r\n  go deep enough for the Fin to cut off the Furrow at a just Depth, the\r\n  Point will go below the Staple, which may ruin the Soil, unless it be\r\n  very deep.\r\n\r\n  When our _English_ Ploughs go in this manner, they make much worse\r\n  Work than the _Eastern_ Ploughs, that have no Coulter; for these,\r\n  contrary to ours, though they always cut their Furrow diagonally,\r\n  cut it thin on that Side from which it is turned, as our bad Ploughs\r\n  leave it thin on that Side towards which it is turned. The Earth the\r\n  _Easterns_ leave by their Diagonal in one Furrow, is taken off by\r\n  the next; but ours leaving Part of their Furrow behind them, on the\r\n  Side next to the plowed Part of the Field, come at it no more; but\r\n  the other can plow cleaner, their Diagonal being contrary to ours,\r\n  which leaves the Trench deepest on the Side next to the unplowed Part\r\n  of the Field; but unless the Fin of the Four-coultered Plough go\r\n  parallel to the Surface of the Earth, it will not plough at all; or\r\n  will leave Two or Three of its Four Furrows untouched.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 3. Shews the right-hand Side, and upper Side of the Four-coulter\r\nPlough, of which V the Iron Ground-wrist is shewn in _Fig._ 9. long Two\r\nFeet Five Inches, deep at the End _b_ Four Inches, and Three-eighths\r\nof an Inch thick, except at the End _a_, where it is thin enough to\r\nbend, so as to fit close to the Share, as at _e_, in _Fig._ 6. The\r\nGround-wrist has Four small Holes near its End _a_, into one of which\r\ngoes a Nail, to fasten it to the Shear, thro’ the long Hole in the Side\r\nof the Socket of the Share, as at _a_, in _Fig._ 10. and then it will\r\nstand in the Posture shewn by _e f_, in _Fig._ 6. From the Outside\r\nof the Ground-wrist at _f_, to the Outside of the Share at _b_, is\r\nEleven Inches and an half, which is the Width of the lower Part of the\r\nPlough-tail at the Ground; the Ground-wrist has several Holes at the\r\nupper Side of its broadest End, as at _b_, in _Fig._ 9. by which it is\r\nnailed to the lower Part of the Drock T, as in _Fig._ 3. which Drock\r\nwith its Perforations is shewn in _Fig._ 11.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12. Is the Earth-board, with its Inside upwards; the Notch _a\r\nb_ shews the Rising of the Wood, which takes hold of the Edge of the\r\nSheat, to hold it the firmer, to which it is fastened by the Holes\r\n_c_ and _d_; and at the other End it is fastened to the Drock, at the\r\nHole _e_. All which is seen as it stands mark’d with W, in _Fig._ 3.\r\nBut this Pin, with which it is fastened to the Drock, is bigger in the\r\nMiddle than at each End; which prevents the Earth-board from coming\r\nnear the Drock: By this Pin, the Earth-board is set at a greater or\r\nless Distance from the Drock, as there is Occasion to throw off the\r\nFurrow farther from the Plough at some times than at others: It always\r\nstands considerably farther out on the right Hand than the Ground-wrist\r\ndoes, which is one Reason that the Drock is made crooked, bending\r\noutwards in that Part.\r\n\r\nThe long Handle X is _Fig._ 13. long Five Feet Four Inches, broad in\r\nthe widest Part Four Inches, pinned to the Sheat thro’ the Holes _a b_,\r\nand pinned to the Drock through the Hole _c_.\r\n\r\nThe short Handle S is _Fig._ 14. and is long Three Feet Nine Inches,\r\npinned to the hinder Sheat (being _Fig._ 15.) by the Hole _a_, and to\r\nthe Top of the Fore-sheat above the Beam by the Hole _b_.\r\n\r\nThe Handles are made so long, for the more easy guiding of the Plough;\r\nbut the lazy Ploughman is apt to cut them off shorter, close up to the\r\nPlough, to the end that, bearing his whole Weight thereon, he may in\r\na manner ride instead of walking; but if he should thus ride on long\r\nHandles, he would tilt up the Fore-end of the Beam, and raise the Share\r\nout of the Ground.\r\n\r\nThe chief, and most indispensably necessary thing to be observed, is,\r\nto place the Four Coulters in such a manner, that the Four imaginary\r\nPlanes described by the Edges of the Four Coulters, as the Plough moves\r\nforwards, be all of them parallel to each other, or very nearly so;\r\nfor if any one of them should be much inclined to, or recede from,\r\neither of the other three, they could not enter the Ground together.\r\nIn order to place them thus, the Coulter-holes must be made through\r\nthe Beam, in the manner as they are shewn in _Fig._ 3. _viz._ the\r\nSecond Coulter-hole is Two Inches and an half more on the Right than\r\nthe First, the Third, Two and an half more on the right Hand than the\r\nSecond, and the Fourth, Two Inches and an half more on the right Hand\r\nthan the Third, conformable to the Four Incisions or Cuts they are to\r\nmake in a Ten-inch Furrow: And because no single Beam is broad enough\r\nto hold the Four Coulter-holes at this Distance, we are forced to add\r\nthe Piece shewn in _Fig._ 16. The Second Hole is made Part in the Beam,\r\nand Part in this Piece; the Third and Fourth are made wholly in this\r\nPiece, in which _a_, _b_, _c_, are the Ends of the Three Screws, which\r\nfasten the Piece to the right Side of the Beam by their Nuts.\r\n\r\nThe Distance of Two Inches and an half, by which each of the Three\r\nadded Coulters stand more to the right Hand than that immediately\r\nbehind it, must be reckoned from the Middle of one Hole to the Middle\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\nThe Fore-part of every Hole must incline a little towards the Left; so\r\nthat the Backs of the Coulters may not bear against the left Side of\r\nthe Incisions made by the Edges.\r\n\r\nEach Hole, being a Mortise, is one Inch and a quarter wide, with its\r\nTwo opposite Sides parallel from Top to Bottom; each of these Mortises,\r\nor Holes, are long at Top Three Inches and an half, and at Bottom\r\nThree Inches; the Back-part, or Hinder-end, of each Coulter-hole\r\nis not perpendicular, but oblique, and determines the Obliquity of\r\nthe Standing of the Coulter, which is wedged tight up to it by the\r\nPoll-wedge _i_, _Fig._ 1. as all Coulters are.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 17. Is a Coulter; _a b_ is its Length, being Two Feet Eight\r\nInches, before it is worn; _e d_ is its Edge, Sixteen Inches long; _d\r\nc_ is the Length of its Handle, Sixteen Inches; this is made thus long,\r\nat first, to stand above the Plough, that it may be driven down lower,\r\naccording as the Point wears shorter; this Handle is One Inch and\r\nSeven Eighths broad, and Seven Eighths of an Inch thick, equally thro’\r\nits whole Length: Its Breadth and Thickness might be described by a\r\nrectangled Parallelogram.\r\n\r\nIn all Ploughs this first Coulter is, or ought to be, placed in the\r\nBeam in manner following; _viz._ its Back to bear against the Back\r\nof the Coulter-hole, its right Side above to bear against the upper\r\nEdge of the Coulter-hole, and its left Side to bear against the lower\r\nEdge of the Coulter-hole; so that always Three Wedges at least will be\r\nnecessary to hold the Coulter; the Poll-wedge before it, as at _i_, in\r\n_Fig._ 1. another Wedge on the left Side of it above, and a Third on\r\nthe right Side underneath: The Coulter-hole must be so made, that the\r\nCoulter standing thus across the Hole, its Point may incline so much\r\ntowards the Left, as to be about Two Inches and an half farther to the\r\nLeft[260] than the Point of the Share, if it were driven down as low as\r\nit; but it never ought to be so low in any Plough: As to its bearing\r\nforwards, the Point of the Coulter should never be before the Middle\r\nof the Point of the Share: What Angle the Coulter would make with the\r\nBottom of the Share, may be seen by the Posture it stands in, in _Fig._\r\n1. If it should be set much more obliquely, it would have a greater\r\nForce to raise up the Poll-wedge, and get loose.\r\n\r\n  [260] I find that sometimes it is necessary in some of these Ploughs\r\n  for the Point of this Coulter to stand yet farther on the Left of the\r\n  Share’s Point.\r\n\r\nThe Three added Coulters should stand in the same Posture with this\r\nalready described, in regard to the Inclination of their Points towards\r\nthe Left: And this is a very great Advantage to them; for by this\r\nmeans, when the Fin is rais’d up, by turning the Handles towards the\r\nLeft, their Points do not rise out of the Ground on the right Hand,\r\nas they would do without this described Inclination towards the Left;\r\nbut in regard to their Pointing forwards, I find it best, that every\r\none of the Three should be a little more perpendicular than that next\r\nbehind it. So the Coulter 4 stands the nearest to Perpendicular of\r\nany of them. By this means there being more Room betwixt them above\r\nthan below, they are the more easily freed from the Turf, whenever the\r\nPieces, being covered with a great Quantity of Couch-grass, or the\r\nlike, rise up betwixt them: which tho’ this seldom happens, makes a\r\nNecessity for a Man, or a Boy, to go on the Side with a forked Stick,\r\nto push out the Turf and Grass, which might otherwise fill the Spaces\r\nbetwixt the Coulters, and raise up the Plough out of its Work.\r\n\r\n’Tis to be observed, that none of these Coulters ought to descend so\r\nlow as the Bottom of the Share, except when you plow very shallow: ’Tis\r\nalways sufficient that they cut through the Turf, let the Plough go\r\nnever so deep in the Ground.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also, that when you plow very shallow, the Fin of the\r\nShare be broad enough to cut off the Fourth Piece or Furrow; else that,\r\nlying fast, will be apt to raise up the Ground-wrist, and throw out the\r\nPlough: But when you plow deep, the Ground-wrist will break off this\r\nFourth Furrow, altho’ the Fin be not broad enough to reach it.\r\n\r\nSometimes the First or left Furrow is apt to come through betwixt the\r\nFirst Coulter and the Sheat, and so falls on the left-hand Side of\r\nthe Plough: This is no Injury; but yet it is prevented, by letting\r\nthe Second Coulter stand a little higher than the Third; and then the\r\nSecond Furrow, holding the First at its Bottom, will carry it over,\r\ntogether with itself, on the right Side by the Earth-board; but yet\r\nnever set this, or any of the Three added Coulters, so high that they\r\nmay not cut through the Turf. But as for the first Coulter, tho’ it\r\nshould cut but an Inch or Two within the Ground, the Share will break\r\noff the first Furrow in raising it up.\r\n\r\nRemember, as often as the Point of any Coulter is worn too short,\r\nthat you drive down the Coulter with a large Hammer, carried for that\r\nPurpose; and when it is driven low enough, fasten the Wedges again, so\r\nas to keep the Coulters in their right Postures, that their Incisions\r\nmay be all of them equidistant.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 18. Is a Nut, with Two of its opposite Corners turn’d up, by\r\nwhich it is driven round by a Hammer, and has so great a Force, that\r\nThree of them, with their Screws properly placed, hold the Piece,\r\n_Fig._ 16. as fast to the Plough-beam, as if they both were made of\r\none Piece of Wood; but as often as the Wood shrinks in dry Weather,\r\nthe Nuts must be screw’d farther on, both here and in all other Places\r\nwhere they are used: particularly, those which hold up the Retch; for\r\nif the Sheat should once get loose, there is no Cure but by a new one.\r\n\r\nBetwixt this Nut and the Wood, there should be a thin Iron Bolster,\r\nabout the Thickness of a Shilling, broader than the Nut, to prevent\r\nthe Nut from eating into the Wood, especially when it is to be often\r\nscrew’d, as on the Retch of these Ploughs, and most of all on the\r\nHoe-plough; but sometimes we use a Piece of Shoe-leather instead of an\r\nIron Bolster.\r\n\r\n_Note_, There must be Iron Plates upon all the Coulter-holes both above\r\nand below, Three of which are seen on the Piece in _Fig._ 16. There is\r\nno need to say how they must be nailed on with many Nails made for the\r\nPurpose.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 19. Is the Iron Collar, fastened to the Beam by Two short Crooks\r\nA, B, which take hold of Two short Pins driven into the Plough just\r\nbehind the Second Coulter-hole, one on one Side, and the other on the\r\nother Side of the Beam. The Crook A is seen on the left Side of the\r\nBeam near _c_, in _Fig._ 2. the Crook B doing the same on the other\r\nSide of the Beam, which is seen near _a_, in _Fig._ 3. C is the Crook\r\n(for its Shape called a C) which holds the Tow-chain to the Collar by\r\nthe Link D, being Part of the said Chain taking hold of its Fore-claw;\r\nthe other Claw taking hold of one of the Five Notches of the Collar:\r\nThis Collar is partly seen at _d_, in _Fig._ 2. Both the Claws of the\r\nCrook (or C) turn upwards, so that they cannot take hold of any thing\r\nthat may rise under the Plough: The Use of the Notches is to help the\r\nDirection of the Point of the Share, which has been described by the\r\nprick’d Lines under _Fig._ 1. As the Point of the Share wears, it\r\ninclines a little more towards the Right, and is remedied by moving the\r\nCrook into a Notch nearer to the Left, which will direct the Point a\r\nlittle more towards the Left: This is more easy to be done here than\r\nin the common Plough, whose Collar moves round the Beam: We can, by\r\nchanging the Crook from one Notch to another, incline the Point of the\r\nShare towards the Right or Left at Pleasure. The Length of each Side of\r\nthis Collar is a Foot long.\r\n\r\nThe Tow-chain is best seen in _Fig._ 3. where the Link Y is that which\r\npasses thro’ the Box, and is pinned in by the Stake, as has been shewn\r\nin _Fig._ 1. which Stake is commonly nailed to the Box, to prevent its\r\nrising up. When we would draw up the Plough a little nearer to the\r\nCrow-staves, we take hold of the Crook by a Second or Third Link.\r\n_Note_, That the shortening of the Chain does also a little incline the\r\nPoint of the Share towards the Left.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 20. is the Iron-wilds. The Leg A is of one Piece with that which\r\nhas the Notch, and that passes thro’ the Leg B by the Loop at _a_;\r\nboth which Legs pass thro’ the Box, and are pinned in behind it, by\r\nthe crooked Pins C, D. This Figure is seen with its Crooks on it, both\r\nin _Fig._ 1. and _Fig._ 2. _Note_, That the Holes in the Box, thro’\r\nwhich these Legs pass, must not be made at right Angles with the Box,\r\nbut must incline upwards, so that the Fore-part of the Wilds may be\r\nhigher than the Hinder-part, or else the Upper-part of the Crow-staves\r\nwould lean quite back when the Plough is drawn. If the Beasts that\r\ndraw immediately next to the Plough be very high, their Traces must be\r\nthe longer; else they and the Wilds making too small an Angle with the\r\nTow-chain at the Box, when they draw hard, the Wheels will rise from\r\nthe Ground, and be apt to overturn: This Angle I suppose should not\r\nbe less than of 160 Degrees, and the Angle made by the Tow-chain or\r\nTraces that are drawn by the Cattle that go before them, will make an\r\nAngle with the Tow-chain at the Box yet much more obtuse. The Use of\r\nthese Notches in the Wilds is, to give the Plough a broader or narrower\r\nFurrow: If the Links are moved to the Notches on the right Hand, it\r\nbrings the Wheels towards the left Hand, which gives a greater Furrow;\r\nand when the Links are moved towards the left Hand, it gives a less\r\nFurrow, by bringing the Wheels towards the right Hand.\r\n\r\nThe Distance betwixt the Two Legs of the Wilds is Eight Inches and\r\nan half; the Length of the Legs is Nineteen Inches. They must be of\r\nconvenient Strength. The Links being placed in Notches distant from one\r\nanother, prevents one Wheel from advanceing before the other; which\r\nwould happen, if the Links were both in One Notch, or in Two adjoining\r\nNotches, except they were middle Notches: These Links are each Six\r\nInches and an half long.\r\n\r\nE is the Ring, by which the Two Links, and the Two Crooks F and G, are\r\nheld together, and on which they all move.\r\n\r\nThe Height of the Wheels in _Fig._ 2. The left-hand Wheel is Twenty\r\nInches Diameter; the Diameter of the right Wheel is Two Feet Three\r\nInches; the Distance the Wheels are set from each other at the Ground,\r\nis Two Feet Five Inches and an half; the Crow-staves are One Foot\r\nEleven Inches high, from the Box to the Gallows; they both stand\r\nperpendicular to the Box, and the Distance between the Crow-staves is\r\nTen Inches and an half. The Pillow is pinned up at its Ends by Two\r\nsmall Iron Pins, which are chained to it, that if they drop, they may\r\nnot be lost. These appear in _Fig._ 1. and _Fig._ 2. The Height from\r\nthe level Surface, up to the Hole in the Box, where the Tow-chain\r\npasses through it, is Thirteen Inches (being Two Inches below the Holes\r\nof the Wilds, on the Hinder-side of the Box); the Height at the other\r\nEnd, where the Crook of the Collar takes hold of the Pin in the Beam at\r\n_c_, in _Fig._ 2. is Twenty Inches high above the same level Surface,\r\nand shews how much the Chain descends forward, for drawing down the\r\nPlough, and by which Descent may be known what Angle the Chain would\r\nmake with the Surface, if it were produced forwards in a strait Line;\r\nwhich is a thing material for the good going of a Plough; and so is\r\nthe Angle the Tow-chain makes with the Beam: About the Middle of this\r\nTow-chain, there should be a Swivel, whereby one End of the Chain may\r\nturn without the other.\r\n\r\nWhen this Four coulter Plough is made, I would advise, that it be tried\r\nwith only the first Coulter, before the other Three are put in; for\r\nif the Plough does not go well with One Coulter, it is not likely it\r\nshould go well with Four; and I never yet have seen or heard of any\r\nthat went well with One Coulter, that did not also go well with Four,\r\nbeing placed as is here directed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate II._\r\n\r\n_P. 307_\r\n\r\n_B Cole Delin et Sculp_]\r\n\r\nThe Proofs of a Plough’s performing well are these; _viz._ If it makes\r\na Furrow of an equal Depth on the right Hand and on the left, and turns\r\nit off fairly: If, in its going, the Tail of the Share, and the Bottom\r\nof the Drock, bear against the Bottom of the Furrow; and if it goes\r\neasy in the Hands of the Holder, without pressing one Arm more than the\r\nother; then the Plough is certainly a good one.\r\n\r\nThe Ploughman who is accustom’d to a Two-wheel’d Plough, never suffers\r\nthe Wheels to overturn, in turning out at the Land’s End, from one\r\nFurrow to another; for which Purpose, after he has lifted the Plough\r\na little round, he has a Knack of holding up the Crow-staves with the\r\nEnd of the Beam, by pressing his Hand hard against the Handle, whilst\r\nthe Plough lies down on one Side, until the Horses, the Wheels, and the\r\nPlough, come near to a Line in the Beginning of the Furrow; and then he\r\nlifts up his Plough, and goes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\n_Of the Drill-Boxes._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Drill is the Engine that plants our Corn and other Seeds in Rows:\r\nIt makes the Chanels, sows the Seed into them, and covers them at the\r\nsame time, with great Exactness and Expedition.\r\n\r\nThe principal Parts of the Drill are, the Seed-box, the Hopper, and the\r\nPlough, with its Harrow.\r\n\r\nOf these the Seed-box is the Chief: It measures (or rather numbers) out\r\nthe Seed which it receives from the Hopper: It is for this Purpose as\r\nan artificial Hand, which performs the Task of delivering out the Seed,\r\nmore equally than can be done by a natural Hand.\r\n\r\nIt is described, together with some of its Appurtenances, in _Plates_ 2\r\nand 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The_ MORTISE.\r\n\r\nAs the Seed-box is the principal Part of a Drill, so is the Mortise the\r\nprincipal Part of the Seed-box.\r\n\r\nThe following Descriptions shew how this Mortise differs from a common\r\nMortise.\r\n\r\nFig. 1. _Plate_ 2. shews both the upper and lower Edges of a\r\nTurnep-Seed-box, and the Manner how they are posited one over another,\r\n_a b c d_ is a rectangled Parallelogram, and shews the upper Edges (or\r\nTop) of the Mortise. _e f g h_, being a Figure of the same Denomination\r\nwith the former, is the lower Edges (or Bottom) of the Mortise. The\r\nLine _e h_ is the Length of the lower Edge of the Hinder-end of the\r\nMortise. _a d_ is the upper Edge of the Hinder-end of the Mortise, and\r\nposited just over the lower Edge of the same End. The Space between\r\nthe Line _a b_, and the Line _e f_, shews half the Excess whereby the\r\nBottom of the Mortise exceeds the Top in Breadth; as the Space on the\r\nopposite Side, betwixt the Line _c d_, and the Line _g h_, shews the\r\nother Half of that Excess, both which Halves, taken together, shew\r\nthe whole Bevel (or Angle of Inclination) described in _Fig._ 2. That\r\nPart of the Line _a b_, from the Angle at _b_ to the Line _f g_, which\r\nintersects it, shews the Excess whereby the Top of the Mortise exceeds\r\nthe Bottom in Length.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 2. Is the Mortise cut down by its Four Corners, and laid open.\r\n_a b c d_ is a Trapezium, with Two parallel Sides, and mark’d A, the\r\nright Side of the Mortise; its opposite Side _e f g h_, mark’d B, the\r\nleft Side of the Mortise; the Areas of both being true Planes[261].\r\n\r\n  [261] Take care that these opposite Sides be sure to be true\r\n  Planes, especially all that Part of their Areas, that is before the\r\n  transverse Axes of their Ellipses herein after described; for should\r\n  they be otherwise, the Bevel of the Mortise would be spoiled, and\r\n  so would the Ellipses, and the acute Triangles, on the Sides of\r\n  the Tongue; which how necessary they are to be true, is shewn in\r\n  the proper Place. Workmen are very apt to fail in this when they\r\n  file by Hand, and make these Sides of the Mortise convex instead of\r\n  plane. Therefore this might be done with less Difficulty, and more\r\n  Exactness, with a File placed in a Frame, whereby it might move upon\r\n  a true Level without rising or sinking of either End.\r\n\r\n_d i k h_ Shew the Fore-end of the Mortise, mark’d C. _a l m e_ shew\r\nthe Hinder-end of the Mortise, mark’d D. _a d h e_ shew the Bottom of\r\nthe Mortise already described in _Fig._ 1. If these opposite Sides and\r\nEnds were all raised up, until the Angle at _b_ join the Angle at _l_,\r\nand that at _m_ join _f_, and that at _g_ join _k_, and that _i_ join\r\n_c_, the Top of the Mortise would be formed, and the same with the\r\nParallelogram _a b c d_, in _Fig._ 1. and then the intire Mortise of\r\nthe Turnep Seed-box would appear in its true Form, standing upon its\r\nBottom.\r\n\r\nThis differs from a common Mortise, in that it is impossible to fit it\r\nwith a Tenon; because it is narrower above, and shorter below, as in\r\n_Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\nThe Areas, or imaginary Planes, of the Top and Bottom of the Mortise,\r\nare parallel to each other, but not equal.\r\n\r\nIts Two opposite Sides are equal, but not parallel, by reason of their\r\nInclination to each other upwards, which is the Bevel hereafter to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe Two Ends are neither parallel nor equal, because the Hinder-end D\r\nis perpendicular to the Top and Bottom, and the Fore-end oblique, and\r\ntherefore longer.\r\n\r\nWhen Two opposite Sides, or Surfaces, are inclined to each other\r\nupwards, I call that Inclination a Bevel; but when they are inclined\r\ndownwards, I call it a Bevel revers’d.\r\n\r\nThe Line _a e_, being the Bottom, or Base, of the Hinder-end D, by\r\nbeing longer than the Line _l m_, shews that the Mortise is bevel.\r\n\r\nThe Two prick’d Lines _m n_ and _l o_, with the Line _l m_, and Part\r\nof the Line _a e_, make a rectangled Parallelogram, which shews the\r\nexact Depth of the Mortise, and forms on each Side of it a rectangled\r\nTriangle, the one _m e n_, and the other _l o a_; which Triangles being\r\nsimilar and equal, and their acute Angles at _l_ and _m_ being each of\r\nFour Degrees, make the whole Bevel, or Inclination of the Sides of the\r\nMortise, to be of Eight Degrees, their Hypothenuses being the same with\r\nthe Sides of the Mortise.\r\n\r\nThis End D, being raised up to its Place, will be at right Angles\r\nwith the Plane of the Top and of the Bottom of the Mortise; which,\r\nbeing both rectangled Parallelograms, prove that Bevel, or Angle of\r\nInclination, to be the same from one End to the other of the Sides,\r\nwhich Sides are the Hypothenuses of those Two Triangles: But this could\r\nnot be proved by the Triangles in the opposite End C; because the\r\nBases being the same with the other, and having their Legs longer, the\r\nvertical Angles at _k_ and _i_ are more acute. The Legs are longer;\r\nbecause the End C, when in its Place, is not at right Angles with the\r\nTop and Bottom of the Mortise, as the End D is.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be described in the Mortise, is the Bore, great\r\nHole, or Perforation; which is best shewn in the Side of a Mortise\r\nof a Wheat-drill, being larger, as in _Fig._ 3. wherein _c e b d_ is\r\nthe great Hole, and is a Section of an hollow Cylinder, that passes\r\nthrough the Mortise, with its Axis parallel to the Edges of the Ends\r\nof the Mortise: This Cylinder, being cut by the Side of the Mortise\r\nobliquely, and not parallel to its Base, is an Ellipse.\r\n\r\nThe prick’d curve Line is a Circle parallel to the Base of the\r\nCylinder, and the curve Line _b d c e_ is the Ellipsis; and this Curve\r\nis more or less elliptical (or oval) in proportion to the Angle of\r\nInclination, or Bevel, of the Sides of the Mortise.\r\n\r\nOf this Ellipse the longest Diameter (or _Axis transversus_) _b c_ is\r\nat right Angles with the upper and lower Edges of the Sides of the\r\nMortise.\r\n\r\nIts shortest Diameter (or _Axis rectus_) _d e_, is the Diameter of\r\nthe Cylinder, bisecting the _Axis transversus_ at right Angles in the\r\nCentre _a_; and is in this Figure one Inch and an half.\r\n\r\nThis Ellipse being concentric with the Circle, the Letter _a_ is the\r\nCentre of both.\r\n\r\nThe Semi-ellipsis _c e b_ is the Part of chief Use; and therefore\r\nthe Edge must of Necessity be smooth, and without Flaws, as must the\r\nSurfaces of the Sides of the Mortise betwixt the Ellipse and the\r\nFore-end.\r\n\r\nThe Tongue of the Seed-box (_Plate_ 3. _Fig._ 1.) differs from that\r\nin the Sound-board of an Organ (from which I took the Idea of it)\r\nin Shape, in Situation, and in the Manner of its being fix’d to the\r\nMortise.\r\n\r\nThe Tongue, in the Organ, is on its Surface a long Square, or\r\nrectangled Parallelogram, a little broader and longer than the Mortise\r\n(or Grove) it shuts against; but this Tongue on its upper Surface,\r\nwhich is here turned downwards, being a Plane, is a Trapezium, of the\r\nsame Shape with the Fore-end of the Mortise just now described, except\r\nthat the Tongue has a less Bevel.\r\n\r\nThe Situation of that in the Organ is on the Outside of the Mortise,\r\nwhich it shuts by its Spring behind it, and opens immediately by the\r\nFinger of the Organist pressing down the Key to let in the compressed\r\nAir to its Pipes; but this Tongue is situate within the Mortise of the\r\nSeed-box, and placed almost, in a manner, diagonally; for, had it been\r\nplaced like the other, the Seed getting betwixt it and the Edges of the\r\nMortise, would not have given Way to its Shutting (as the Air does to\r\nthe other), but have kept it always open; which would have render’d it\r\nuseless for sowing of Seeds.\r\n\r\nThe Manner of fastening the Organ-tongue to its Mortise is by Parchment\r\nand Leather glu’d to its Surface, and also to the Sound-board, at its\r\nEnd which is opposite to that pressed open by the Key, and shut by the\r\nSpring; but this our Tongue is held within the Mortise, and moves on\r\nan Axis, which passes thro’ its upper and narrower End, which Axis is\r\nthe Pin A (which must be exactly parallel to the Edge of the End of the\r\nMortise), and also thro’ the Hole _f_ in _Fig._ 3. in _Plate_ 2. which\r\nis seen in its Place at A in _Fig._ 3. _Plate_ 3. and likewise through\r\nboth Sides of the Mortise near their upper Edges, and as near the\r\nFore-end of the Mortise as may be, without the Tongue’s rubbing against\r\nthe said Fore-end.\r\n\r\nThe Breadth of the Tongue must be conformed to the Breadth and Bevel\r\nof the Mortise, and when it is on its Axis, it being raised tight up\r\nas far as the short prick’d Line _l m_ in _Fig._ 3. _Plate_ 2. being\r\nOne-eighth Part of the great Hole, and being there, you see its upper\r\nEdges touch both Sides of the Mortise by their whole Length: Then it is\r\nrightly made: and by this touching both Sides of the Mortise tightly\r\nand closely, when raised up to that Degree, it appears, that the Two\r\nupper Edges of the Sides of the Tongue are inclined to each other in\r\nan Angle that is more acute, by about One-third, than is the Angle of\r\nInclination of the Sides of the Mortise.\r\n\r\nHence, when the Tongue is let down to its Place, there will be on each\r\nSide of it an empty Space, betwixt it and the Mortise, of the Form of\r\na very acute Triangle, whose vertical Angle is more or less acute,\r\naccording as the Tongue approaches nearer to, or recedes farther from\r\nthe Spindle.\r\n\r\nThis _Fig._ 1. _Plate_ 3. is the brass Tongue with its Back-side\r\nupwards. The Two outer Lines _a b_ and _c d_ are the Edges of the upper\r\nSurface (tho’ turned downwards in this Figure), which are inclined to\r\neach other, as afore-mentioned; but the Two inner Lines _e f_ and _g h_\r\nare nearer to each other, whereby this under Surface is narrower than\r\nthe upper: Both must be plain Surfaces, but the upper and its Two Edges\r\nvery free from Flaws, and smooth, or polished.\r\n\r\nThe Reason why the under Surface is narrower than the upper, is to\r\npreserve the Bevel of the empty Triangle: For though the Bevel of the\r\nSides of the Mortise would be sufficient for this, if both Sides of the\r\nTongue were sure to keep equally distant from the Spindle; yet as the\r\nTongue never is so tight on its Axis, but that sometimes one Corner of\r\nit may be nearer to the Spindle than the other, in this Case, that Side\r\nwhich is nearest to the Spindle would reverse that Bevel, so as to make\r\nthe small empty Space that is betwixt the Mortise and the Tongue, wider\r\nabove than underneath.\r\n\r\nC C are the Two little Knobs that prevent the Spring from slipping to\r\neither Side, and are at the Distance from one another of the Breadth of\r\nthe Spring.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 2. shews one Side, and the Thickness of the Tongue the other\r\nSide, being the same. _a b_ shews the polished Surface (being a true\r\nPlane), whereon the Seed runs down to the Spindle. _c d_ the Back-side,\r\nwhich lies turned uppermost in _Fig._ 1. _b e d_ shews one End of the\r\nhollow Cylinder of the Tongue, thro’ which its Axis passes.\r\n\r\nThe Length of the Tongue must be such, as will reach lower than just\r\nto touch the Bottom of the great Hole as a Tangent: for, if it be\r\nnot longer than that, it might happen, that when the Mortise is empty\r\nof Seed, and the Tongue set up close, a Wheel might, in Turning, or\r\notherwise, go a little backwards, and cause a Notch of the Spindle to\r\ntake hold of the End of the Tongue, and tear it out of the Mortise:\r\nTherefore let the Tongue reach a little below the Spindle, as the\r\npricked Line _g h_, in _Fig._ 3. of _Plate_ 2. doth.\r\n\r\nAs for the Posture in which the Tongue ought to stand in the Mortise,\r\nit is shewn by the Three pricked Lines in _Fig._ 3. _Plate_ 2. where\r\nthe pricked Line _g h_ makes an Angle of Forty-five Degrees, being the\r\nnearest that it can stand to the Spindle; the pricked Line _i h_ makes\r\na somewhat greater Angle, and it is a mean (or middle) Distance from\r\nthe Spindle; and the pricked Line _k h_ is supposed to be its greatest\r\nDistance, where the Tongue makes its greatest Angle with the Top and\r\nBottom of the Mortise. If the Tongue stood so obliquely as to make\r\nan Angle much less than Forty-Five, the Tongue would rise too much\r\nagainst the Bevel of the Mortise, and the Spring would have the greater\r\nDifficulty in returning it to its Place, when driven back by the Force\r\nof the Notches.\r\n\r\nAnd beside, when the Tongue stood wide from the Spindle, there might be\r\nso much Room betwixt it and the Sides of the Mortise, that some Seeds\r\nmight fall thro’ there.\r\n\r\nThe Steel Spring is D, properly placed upon the Back of the Tongue, in\r\n_Fig._ 1. _Plate_ 3.\r\n\r\nAt first, I made the Spring double, _i. e._ with Two Legs, in Imitation\r\nof that in the Organ, and fastened into its Tongue, much after the same\r\nmanner as the Spring of the Organ is into its Tongue or Flap, which\r\nprevents the compressed Air from passing out of the Sound-board, except\r\nwhilst the Key is thrust down by the Finger of the Player; but the\r\nDrill-spring requiring to be of a vastly greater Strength than that,\r\nI made it of Steel, of the Breadth of half an Inch, instead of Brass\r\nWire: This performed very well, and several Drills are yet extant, that\r\nhave only this Sort of Springs: Yet I found there was great Difficulty\r\nto set the Legs at their due Distance from each other; for their\r\nSeasoning would alter them from what they were, whilst the Steel was\r\nsoft: They also took up too much Room in the upper Part of the Mortise.\r\nThen, to remedy these Inconveniencies, I made it single, with only\r\none Leg, which by full Experience is found to be much better than the\r\ndouble one; it does not contain a Fourth Part of the Metal, and is most\r\neasily made, requiring none of that Trouble and Nicety that the double\r\nSpring doth. I shall therefore give a Description of the single Spring\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nB, the End of the Screw, which holds the Spring to the Tongue, thro’ a\r\nHole near the upper End of the Spring; D, the Middle, against which the\r\nEnd of the Setting-screw bears.\r\n\r\nIts Length is almost the whole Length of the Tongue; the End E reaching\r\nvery near to the lower End of the Tongue, and the End B is as near\r\nthe upper End of the Tongue; as it can be placed without touching the\r\nCylinder of the Tongue.\r\n\r\nThe Breadth is usually about half an Inch; the Thickness must be in\r\nproportion to its other Dimensions, and according to the Degree of\r\nStiffness required.\r\n\r\nThe longer it is, the thicker it must be, to have the same Stiffness;\r\nbut the broader it is, the thinner it must be of the same Length; so\r\nthat it is hard to determine its Thickness. It is made stiffer or\r\nstronger by being cut shorter; it is made weaker, or less stiff, by\r\nfiling or grinding it either thinner or narrower.\r\n\r\nThe common Thickness is about that of a Shilling[262].\r\n\r\n  [262] Not quite so thick as a milled Shilling, but rather of an old\r\n  broad stamped Shilling, which is a little thinner.\r\n\r\nThe Degrees of Stiffness are measured in this manner; _viz._ Fix Two\r\nBoards together, leaving a Chink betwixt them, in one Place of an Inch\r\nlong; lay the Spring (when seasoned across this Chink) with its Middle\r\nexactly over it; then put a String over the Spring, which may pass\r\nwith both Ends thro’ the Chink, and tie so much Weight to the Ends of\r\nthe String under the Boards, that will pull down the Middle of the\r\nSpring, till it touch the Chink, and is strait with both its Ends; This\r\nwill shew the Degree of Stiffness. But note, That the Spring must be\r\ncrooked, and bear only upon its Ends, with the hollow Side upwards.\r\n\r\nIf ten or a dozen Pounds Weight pull it down to the Board, it is a good\r\nDegree of Stiffness, for a large Box: We are not confined to be very\r\nnice or exact in the Degree of Stiffness; for by our Fingers pressing\r\nit, we that are practised in it, know well enough, whether a Spring be\r\nof a sufficient Degree of Stiffness, without weighing it; but for such\r\nwho are unacquainted with them, it is best not to trust to Guess, but\r\nWeights; and to adjust the Stiffness to that of a Spring, that has been\r\nknown to perform well.\r\n\r\nThe Spring must bear against the Back of the Tongue at each End, and\r\nlie hollow in the Middle: But the Degree of Hollowness of the Spring is\r\nvery material; for thereon depends the Distance of the Tongue’s Motion\r\ntowards the Spindle by Force of the Spring, and back again quite to the\r\nSetting-screw, by the Seed that is pressed against it by Force of the\r\nNotches, when they are moved by the Wheels; because the more the Spring\r\nis curved, the farther will it thrust the Tongue from its Middle, if\r\nits Strength be superior to the Force that resists it, as it ought\r\nto be when a Notch is passed and before the next: This Motion of the\r\nTongue is called its Play.\r\n\r\nIn order to measure the Distance (or Quantity) of this Motion, we must\r\nconsider, that the Tongue, moving on its Axis above, describes with its\r\nlower End the Arch of a Circle, the Chord of which Arch is the Measure\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nTo measure this by the Angle the Tongue makes at its Centre, would\r\nbe no Rule for making Boxes; because some Tongues are longer, some\r\nshorter, in proportion to the different Diameters of the Spindles they\r\nmove against; and yet the Play of the shortest must be as much as that\r\nof the longest, that is, it must describe as great an Arch at the Place\r\nof Pressure (described in _Fig._ 3. _Plate_ 2.); and therefore the\r\nshortest Tongue would make the greatest Angle.\r\n\r\nA short and easy Way, then, for a Mechanic to measure, is thus: Screw\r\nin the Setting-screw until the Tongue come within a quarter of an Inch\r\nof touching the Spindle; then take out the Spindle, and from the Centre\r\nof the Hole draw a Line on the Side of the Mortise, perpendicular to\r\nthe Tongue, and at the Tongue’s Edge make a Mark with the Compasses,\r\nor a Pen; then force back the Tongue against the Setting-screw as far\r\nas it will go (that is, until the Spring touch the whole Back of the\r\nTongue); produce the said Line to the same Edge of the Tongue, or set\r\nthe End of the Rule thereon, and draw another Line, by the Rule, from\r\nthe Mark to the Edge of the Tongue, when farthest back, and there\r\nmake the second Mark. The Ruler used this Way will shew both the\r\nPerpendicular, and the Measure.\r\n\r\nBut yet a quicker Way is, to set the Tongue, by the Setting-screw up\r\nto the Edge of the Hole; and, when it is forced back, measure from\r\nthe Tongue to the nearest Part of the Hole, which will ever be a\r\nperpendicular Line drawn from the Centre of the Hole to the Place of\r\nPressure above-mentioned, and make another Mark there: Now the Distance\r\nbetween these Two Marks is the Measure (near enough) of the Tongue’s\r\nPlay at the Place of Pressure. Tho’ this Line drawn on the Side of the\r\nMortise be not exactly perpendicular to the Surface of the Tongue, but\r\nonly to its Edge; yet the Difference is next to nothing, and not to be\r\nregarded.\r\n\r\nIf its Measure be a quarter of an Inch, it is what Experience shews to\r\nbe of a good Size for all Corn and Peas; a little less is no Harm, but\r\ngreater is the most fatal Error, into which most of the Pretenders to\r\nthe making of this Machine have fallen; they give the Tongue half an\r\nInch, sometimes Three quarters of an Inch Play. The Mischief of this\r\nError is yet farther increased, if the Spring be weak, if the Mortise\r\nhave too great a Bevel, or if the Angle made by the Tongue at the upper\r\nEdge of the Mortise be too acute.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tongue has too great Play, the Seed is apt to be turned out\r\ntoo fast, or else too slow, in spite of the Driller. For when the\r\nTongue is set at its due Distance from the Spindle, and is thrust quite\r\nback by the Seed pressed against it by the Turning of the Notches; but\r\nthe Spring being unable to return the Tongue to its former Place at\r\nsuch a Distance, at the time of passing the Intervals which are betwixt\r\nthe Notches; then the Space between the Spindle and the Tongue being\r\ntoo open, the Seed is sent down too fast.\r\n\r\nTo prevent that, they set up the Tongue to the Spindle; and then,\r\nas often as the Spring happens to overcome the Force of the Seed’s\r\nPressure (as sometimes it will), it is sent out too slowly.\r\n\r\nThe Inequality of the Running of the Seed makes such Boxes useless,\r\nwhich the Expence of Two-pence (for another Spring, or new Seasoning\r\nof that) at most would rectify, if the Maker understood how to mend\r\nhis own Work. If time did permit, more should be said on this Point,\r\nbecause I find it is the _Pons Asini_ of a Workman. Sometimes it may\r\nbe prevented, when the Spring is too hollow, and gives too much Play.\r\nScrew the Screw, that holds it on the Tongue, down closer, so that the\r\nlower Part of the Screw’s Head press against the Spring, and thereby\r\nforce its Middle nearer to the Tongue, until you find its Play lessened\r\nto its just Distance.\r\n\r\nThe Spring, remaining in this compressed State, has lost the weakest,\r\nand retains only the strongest, Part of its elastic Force. Therefore,\r\nif you find it then too stiff, make it weaker by Filing or Grinding, or\r\nelse put another into its Place, which is honestly worth no more than\r\nTwo-pence.\r\n\r\nThis Holding-screw has a pretty broad Head, and is screwed in by a\r\nNotch, like the Screw-pin of a Gun-lock.\r\n\r\nThe Hole in the Spring must be somewhat bigger than the Holding-screw,\r\nbecause the Spring must have room to move and play thereon.\r\n\r\nIf the Middle of the Spring were against the Middle of that Part of\r\nthe Tongue, that is betwixt its Axis and the Place of Pressure, the\r\nDistance of the Spring’s Hollowness would be just half the Distance of\r\nthe Spring’s Play, to wit, the One-eighth Part of an Inch; but as the\r\nSpring does not quite reach up to the Axis, and reaches much below the\r\nPlace of Pressure, the Hollowness at the Place where the Setting-screw\r\nbears against the Middle of the Spring at D, is considerably nearer to\r\nthe Place of Pressure than to the Axis of the Tongue; this Hollowness\r\nof the Spring at the Setting-screw may be something more than the\r\nOne-eighth Part of an Inch, to give the Spring a Quarter of an Inch\r\nPlay: but it seldom has so much.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 4. in _Plate_ 2. shews the Length and Thickness of the Steel\r\nSpring of a Turnep Seed-box: This serves both for a Tongue and Spring:\r\nIt is made first strait, and then the narrowest End of it is turned\r\nround, till it reach to _a_, and forms the Cylinder A, thro’ which\r\nits Axis passes; but is not welded or joined to the other Part of\r\nthe Spring at _a_: It is placed in the Box with the Cylinder Part\r\nunderneath. The Face of this Spring is seen upon its Axis, mark’d K. in\r\n_Fig._ 5. Its Axis is to pass thro’ the Hole E, and screw into the Hole\r\nF, in _Fig._ 2. as is seen more plainly at _a_ in _Fig._ 9.\r\n\r\nAs the Top of every Tongue ought to be even with the upper Edges of\r\nthe Mortise, the Thickness of the Cylinder of the Brass Tongue causes\r\nthe Hole in the Sides of the Mortise, into which it is held by its\r\nAxis, to be far enough from the Edges of the Mortise, to be bored and\r\nscrewed without Danger of breaking the said Edges; but the Spring\r\nof the Turnep-drill being so very thin, there is some Difficulty in\r\nmaking the Hole so high, and near the Edges: To prevent which Danger,\r\n_Fig._ 7. shews the End of a small hollow Cylinder of Iron or Brass,\r\nof the Thickness of the Mortise; which, being put into the Cylinder\r\nA, in _Fig._ 4. raises the Spring higher above the Hole; so that it\r\nmay be made as low in a Turnep Mortise, as that is which holds the\r\nBrass Tongue in the Wheat-drill. But we do not always use this inner\r\nCylinder[263]; but must then take the more Care in boring the Hole, or\r\nelse it will burst out at the Edges of the Mortise.\r\n\r\n  [263] For, instead of this, we may use a Bit of Woolen Cloth of the\r\n  Breadth of the Mortise, glued on to the Bottom of the Hopper, which,\r\n  filling the Vacuity above the Steel Tongue, prevents any Seed from\r\n  running over it, though the Holes are bored as low in the Mortise as\r\n  if the Cylinder _Fig._ 7. were to be used.\r\n\r\nIts Shape must conform to that of the Brass Tongue already described.\r\n\r\nThe Degree of its Stiffness is known by weighing, as has been directed\r\nfor the other Spring; and being laid with its Face downwards over a\r\nChink, with a small Piece of Wood of the Thickness of a Barley-corn at\r\nEach end, and a String taking hold of its Middle, and descending thro’\r\nthe Chink, the Weight of Five Pounds, tied to the End of the String,\r\nwill just bend the Spring, till it touch the Edges of the Chink; and\r\nthis is the Stiffness of a Spring that has performed well, for many\r\nYears, in drilling of Turnep-seed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The_ SETTING-SCREW.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 6. is the Iron Setting-screw, which passes thro’ the Hole in the\r\nFore-end of the Mortise, _Fig._ 2. and passes up to the Middle of the\r\nSpring by the prick’d Line _p q_ in the same Figure. The Use of this\r\nSetting-screw is, to increase or diminish the Proportion of Seed to be\r\nturned out by the Notches; and this it does by forcing up the Spring\r\nand Tongue (where there is one) nearer to, or farther from the Spindle,\r\nwhereby the Seed-passage is made wider or narrower, as is shewn by the\r\nThree prick’d Lines in _Fig._ 2. and _Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\nObserve, that the prick’d Line _p q_, _Fig._ 2. (being the Mortise of\r\nthe Turnep-box) stands higher than the same Line doth in _Fig._ 3.\r\nwhich is the Mortise of the Wheat-box. The Reason of this Difference\r\nis, because the Spring in the Wheat-box bears at its lower End against\r\nthe Tongue below the Seed-passage, and at its upper End below the Axis\r\nof the Tongue, whereby the Middle of that Spring is lower than the\r\nSpring of the Turnep-box, which, being both Spring and Tongue, bears\r\nagainst its Axis above, and against the Seed-passage below; therefore\r\nits Middle is higher. This Setting-screw should be placed perpendicular\r\nto the Tongue when at its mean or middle Distance from the Spindle,\r\nwhich may be supposed to be the middlemost of the Three mention’d\r\nprick’d Lines. This Setting-screw ought to be smooth and round at its\r\nEnd, which bears against the Spring; for, if it should have sharp\r\nCorners or Edges, the Spring might be wounded by them, and in time\r\nmight break there, being press’d by every Notch that turns against it;\r\nand, as I have computed it, a Spring undergoes One hundred thousand\r\nof these Pressures in one Day’s Work; and yet, in my whole Practice,\r\nI have had only one Spring broken, and that was in drilling a large\r\nSort of Peas with a Wheat-drill, and was occasioned by a jagged End of\r\nthe Setting-screw, which was not placed perpendicular to the Spring,\r\nby which means the rough End of the Screw made Scratches against it a\r\nQuarter of an Inch long, and so deep, that the Spring broke off there:\r\nLet not this Setting-screw be any longer than just to force the Tongue\r\nup to the Spindle; for, if it should be longer, an ignorant Driller\r\nmight happen, by the Force of the Screw, to break the Tongue, or its\r\nAxis; but in the Turnep-drill, which has only a Spring instead of a\r\nTongue, the Setting-screw may be a Thread or Two longer; because the\r\nSpring will yield a little to it, after it touches the Spindle, and\r\nis sometimes of Use in that respect, when the Notches are too large.\r\nThis Screw must be of such a Bigness, that it may not be in Danger of\r\nbending; for if it should be bent, it could not be screw’d up with any\r\nCertainty, because its End, being crooked, would be below its Place\r\nat one Half-turn, and above it at the other Half-turn, and so the\r\nSpring might be set farther from the Spindle instead of nearer, and\r\nnearer instead of farther, by the Crookedness of the Setting-screw. Its\r\nHead may be made with a Notch in it, to be screw’d in with a Knife,\r\nor else with a Head like a T, to be turn’d with the Fingers, which I\r\nthink is best, especially for a Wheat-drill; because as the Brine and\r\nLime, which stick on the Wheat, grow drier, it will run faster; and\r\ntherefore the Setting-screw must be frequently screw’d in to lessen the\r\nSeed-passage.\r\n\r\nThe Seed-passage, or Place of Pressure, is where the Seed passes down\r\nbetwixt the Spindle and the Tongue; and is in that Part where they are\r\nnearest together; for there the Seed is press’d hardest by the Force\r\nof the Notches, which carry it down: And this Passage is higher or\r\nlower, as the Tongue stands nearer or farther from the Spindle; for\r\nas it stands wider, it becomes nearer to perpendicular to the Top of\r\nthe Mortise, and then the Seed-passage is higher; and when it stands\r\nnearest to the Spindle, then the Seed-passage is lowest. This appears\r\nin _Fig._ 3. by the Three prick’d Lines _a n_, _a o_, and _a p_.\r\n\r\nThe Spindle, with its Notches, is best shewn where it is large, and\r\nmade of Wood, as that of the Wheat Seed-box; it is a solid Cylinder\r\nthat passes thro’, and fills the great Hole, or hollow Cylinder, of\r\nthe Seed-box; it is of various Lengths, according to the Distance\r\nits Wheels go asunder; it is always in large Boxes the Axis of Two\r\nWheels, and turns round with them, as the Axis of the One Wheel of a\r\nWheelbarrow does with that: These Wheels, by their Circumferences,\r\nmeasure out the Ground over which they carry the Seed-box, and, by the\r\nNotches in their Axis, deliver down the Seed equally, whether they move\r\nswift or slow; because an equal Number of Notchfuls of Seed will be\r\ndeliver’d thro’ the Seed-passage at each Revolution of the Wheels.\r\n\r\nThe Notches resemble those in the Hinder-Cylinder of a Cyder-mill,\r\nwhich break the Apples by turning against the Notches of the\r\nFore-cylinder, as our Notches turn against the Tongue; and bruise the\r\nApples which come betwixt them, as our Notches might sometimes bruise\r\nsoft Seeds, if the Tongue stood close to the Notches, without any\r\nSpring behind it to give Way to their Pressure, and return the Tongue\r\nagain to its Place, at every Interval betwixt Notch and Notch.\r\n\r\nThe best Way, that I can think of, to shew the making of these Notches,\r\nis by a Section of the Spindle at right Angles, in the Middle of\r\nthe Notches, as in _Fig._ 4. of _Plate_ 3. which is a Circle whose\r\nCircumference is cut off by Six Notches; which shew the different Sort\r\nof Notches, that increase or diminish the Proportion of Seed to be\r\ncarried thro’ the Seed-passage by them: The Length of the Notches we\r\nnever alter; but make them always parallel to the Axis of the Spindle,\r\nand of the Length of the Distance there is between the lower Ends of\r\nthe opposite _Axes transversi_ of the Ellipses, or great Holes, of\r\nthe Mortise; for if any Part of the Surface of the Spindle should be\r\nbetwixt the End of a Notch and the Hole, one or more Seeds coming\r\nbetwixt that Surface and the Tongue, might hold it open, and prevent\r\nits pressing against the Notch, to hold the Seed therein from falling\r\nwithout the Turning of the Wheels.\r\n\r\nThis Proportion of Seed is alter’d by the Number of Notches, and by\r\ntheir Depth or Breadth, or by both. _b c_ is the Depth of a Notch,\r\nwhich we call its Side; and is that which takes hold of the Seed, and\r\ncarries it down thro’ the Seed-passage. The Manner of cutting this is\r\nseen by its being a Portion of the _Radius_ A _c_. The Bottom of a\r\nNotch is made in different Forms[264]: As, first, it may be convex, as\r\nis shewn by the curve Line _b d_. We may enlarge the Capacity of this\r\nNotch, by taking off the Convexity of its Bottom, as in the Bottom of\r\nthe Notch shewn by the Line _e f_; and if we would increase it more, we\r\nmake it concave, as _g h_.\r\n\r\n  [264] The convex Form is best for turning out a great Proportion of\r\n  Seed; because such a Bottom may be broader than one of any other\r\n  Form, in a Notch of the same Depth and Capacity; and such a Notch,\r\n  having its Capacity more in Breadth than Depth, will be less liable\r\n  to let fall any Seed without the Turning of the Wheels, than a Notch\r\n  that is deeper and narrower, except it be very narrow, which it\r\n  cannot be for throwing out a large Proportion of Seed; for a great\r\n  Number of Notches cannot have altogether the same Capacity as a\r\n  lesser Number of the same Depth may. The concave Notch, if it were as\r\n  broad as the convex may be, would make the Interstice, that is before\r\n  it, liable to be broken out, and so Two Notches would become One; but\r\n  the Convexity of the other supports the Interstice like an Arch, and\r\n  for that Reason may be made to reach almost quite to the Notch that\r\n  is before it, without that Danger.\r\n\r\nBut of whatever Sort or Dimensions one Notch is made, all the rest\r\nshould be the same exactly; and consequently, the Interstices (or\r\nIntervals) between Notch and Notch, of which the Line _f c_, being an\r\nArch of the Circle, is the Breadth, must be equal[265], and cannot be\r\notherwise, if the Notches are all equal and equidistant, as they appear\r\nin the adjoining _Fig._ 5. which is a Section like the former, and\r\nshews Six Intervals, with their Six Notches, of the Size wherewith we\r\ndrill St. Foin with high Wheels; but when we would drill very thin, it\r\nis better to have but Four or Five Notches instead of Six.\r\n\r\n  [265] But these cannot be equal, unless the Notches are all of equal\r\n  Breadth, and equidistant from one another; and if they are otherwise,\r\n  the Seed will not be equally delivered to the Ground.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 6. shews a Notch of the Spindle. _a b_ is the upper Edge of the\r\nSide of the Notch, being always an acute solid Angle. _c d_ is the Edge\r\nof its Bottom, being always an obtuse Angle. _e f_ is the Angle made\r\nby the Side and Bottom, and is always shorter than the aforesaid Two\r\nEdges, by reason of the Obliquity of the Two Ends; this Angle is never\r\nobtuse, except when the Bottom of the Notch is concave. These Three\r\nLines must be parallel to the Axis of the Spindle.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. is one End of the afore-described Notch; the Line _a b_\r\nbeing joined to the Line _f d_ of _Fig._ 6. and the Line _a c_,\r\nbeing joined to the Line _b f_ in _Fig._ 6. would be the End of that\r\nNotch in its proper Posture; and then the Line _b c_, being an Arch\r\nof the cylindrical Spindle, would be the Edge of the upper End of the\r\nNotch. _a b c_, being the Area of this End, is a Plane, and, when in\r\nits Place, makes an Angle of Forty-five Degrees with the Axis of the\r\nSpindle. The other End is the same with this in all respects, except\r\nthat, being opposite to it, it is inclined to it in an Angle of Ninety\r\nDegrees, at the bottom Angle of the Notch, at the Line _e f_ in _Fig._\r\n6.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. is a Notch lying with its Ends near it, and is of the same\r\nDimensions with those appearing in the Seed-box, _Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\nThe Cover B appears with its upper Surface rightly placed in the\r\nMortise, in _Fig._ 3. of _Plate_ 3. where its Breadth is shewn to be\r\nthe same with that of the Mortise; but its Shape, and other Dimensions,\r\nare best seen in _Fig._ 3. of _Plate_ 2. where _s t_ is its Length,\r\nand reaches from the Hinder-end of the Mortise, to within the Tenth of\r\nan Inch of the upper End of the _Axis transversus_ of the Ellipsis;\r\nits greatest Depth is from _v_ to _w_, and is made so deep, that its\r\nBottom, at _w_, bearing against the End of the Mortise, may prevent its\r\nPoint, which is at _t_, from sinking down to touch the Spindle, which\r\nit neither must do, nor be so high above it as to suffer a Seed to pass\r\nbetween the Spindle and it, tho’ the Seed is not apt to pass that Way,\r\nbecause the Notches throw it forwards from the Cover. _z_ is the Hole,\r\nthro’ which an Iron Screw-pin passes, and screws into the opposite\r\nSides of the Mortise, to hold it firm in its Place: ’Tis made so thin\r\nbetwixt _x_ and _y_ both for Lightness, and that the Seed may come the\r\nmore freely to the Notches, without Danger of Arching at that End. The\r\nUse of the _Cover_ is to prevent any Seed from falling down behind the\r\nSpindle.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 10. _Plate_ 2. is the Fore-end of a Wheat Mortise, with its Hole\r\nA, thro’ which the Setting-screw is screw’d, and passes up to the Back\r\nof the Tongue by the Line _q r_ in _Fig._ 3.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 9. in _Plate_ 3. is the hinder End of a Wheat Mortise, which\r\nby its prick’d Lines, and the Two right-angled Triangles they make,\r\nshews the Bevel of the Mortise, and also its Depth; it also shews\r\nthe Difference of the Bevel of the Mortise, and that of the Tongue,\r\n_Fig._ 1. which is placed against it: These Figures having been already\r\ndemonstrated in the Description of the Turnep Mortise, and in these, I\r\nneed say no more of it, but that I think these last-mention’d Figures\r\nsufficient Directions for understanding and making the Mortise of a\r\nWheat-drill.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 3. of _Plate_ 3. exhibits to View a Wheat Seed-box, with its\r\nAppurtenances, standing upon its Bottom; B the Brass Cover; C the\r\nTongue hanging upon its Axis; _c_ the End of the Iron Screw that holds\r\non the Spring, coming thro’ the Tongue, and filed smooth with it; _a_,\r\n_a_, _a_, are Three Notches of the Spindle, with their bevel Ends; _b_,\r\n_b_, are Two Interstices betwixt the Notches.\r\n\r\nHitherto we have been speaking of the Parts contained in the Wheat\r\nSeed-box; let us now come to the Parts containing: As, first, _d e f\r\ng_ is the upper Surface of the Brass Seed-box, shewing the Top of the\r\nMortise, and what it contains; _h h h_, and _h h h_, shew the Ends of\r\nthe hollow Cylinder, and its Bases coming out on each Side, farther\r\nthan the Box; for if it did not project farther out than the Sides of\r\nthe Box, the Surface of it would be so narrow, that it would cut the\r\nwooden Spindle by the Friction made between it and the Spindle; but\r\nthe Surface, being of this Breadth, never wears into the Spindle, but\r\nmakes it smooth and shining; _i i i_, and _i i i_, shew a Portion of\r\nthe wooden Spindle (of an Inch and an half Diameter) coming out of the\r\nhollow Cylinder, on each Side of the Brass Box.\r\n\r\nThe Spindle is kept from moving end-ways, by Wreaths, in the same\r\nmanner as the Axis of a Wheelbarrow is; which Wreaths shall be\r\ndescribed together with the Hopper. _k_ is the Hole by which the\r\nFore-end of the Seed-box is held up to the Bottom of the Hopper, by a\r\nScrew and Nut. _l_ is the Hole where the Hinder-end of the Box is held\r\nup, in the same manner as the Fore-end is. _m n o p_ shew where the Two\r\nHalves of the Seed-box are joined together.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 10. shews the Outside of One Half of the Brass Seed-box. A A\r\nA shew the Thickness of the projecting Base of the hollow Cylinder,\r\nwhich is made the thicker, to the end that the Hole may be bored large,\r\nand made an Inch and Three Quarters Diameter, when a Spindle that is\r\nto go therein is required to be of that Bigness, by reason of its\r\nextraordinary Length, as it is in the Fore-hopper of the Wheat-drill.\r\nB C shews the Thickness of the Ends of the Seed-box, whereby it is\r\nheld up to the Bottom of the Hopper; if they are not quite a quarter\r\nof an Inch thick, they will be strong enough; especially C, which is\r\nthe hindermost, and which is never pull’d down by the Turning of the\r\nSpindle, but is rather raised up by it.\r\n\r\nD is the Head of the Counter-screw, to be turn’d by the Fingers, to\r\npress against the Side of the Setting-screw, to keep it from turning of\r\nitself, when it is worn loose.\r\n\r\nE is the Hole for the Axis of the Tongue. F is the Hole of an Iron\r\nScrew-pin, which both holds the Cover to its Place, and also the Two\r\nHalves of the Box together. G is the Hole for another Screw-pin,\r\nwhich holds the Two Sides of the Box together. H and I are Holes\r\nfor Two other Screw-pins, which likewise hold the Two Halves of the\r\nBox together, and are placed one above, and the other below, the\r\nSetting-screw; for otherwise that Screw, and its Counter-screw, might\r\nforce open the Joining of the Box, and then the Setting-screw might be\r\nloose, and the Bevel of the Box might be altered; but these Screws,\r\nbeing one on each Side of it, prevent this Inconvenience.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. in _Plate_ 2. is one Half of a Brass Turnep Seed-box, lying\r\nwith its Inside uppermost, which shews the left Side of the Mortise,\r\nand half the Fore-end, and half the Hinder-end, of the Mortise, and\r\nhalf of each Screw-pin Hole, by which it is held up to the Bottom of\r\nthe Hopper. A is half the Hole of the Setting-screw, shewing in the\r\nMiddle of it the End of the Counter-screw. B is half the Hole, by which\r\nthe Steel Spring-cover is held in with a Screw. All the other Holes are\r\nfor the same Purposes, as have been shewn in the Wheat Seed-box.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 9. is the whole Turnep Seed-box, standing upon its Bottom;\r\nPart of its Steel Spring-tongue appears in its Place, as also some of\r\nthe Notches of the Spindle; but more especially the Cover A, which\r\ndiffers from the Cover of the Wheat Mortise, this being a very thin\r\nSpring, whose lower End just reaches to touch (but not to bear upon)\r\nthe Spindle at the upper End of the transverse _Axes_ of the Ellipses;\r\nthe Mortise being filed away at the End, in order that the upper End of\r\nthis Spring, and the Screw which holds it, may not lie above the upper\r\nSurface of the Box. This Spring is made very weak, to the end that, if\r\nby any Chance a soft Seed should stick in a Notch, and be turned round,\r\nthis Spring might suffer it to pass by without breaking it. B, C, are\r\nthe Two Flanks or Sides, made necessarily of this Breadth, for bearing\r\nagainst the Wood of the Bottom of the Hopper, to prevent the Seed from\r\nfalling out betwixt the Wood and the Brass, and that the Hole in the\r\nHopper may be broader than this narrow Mortise of the Seed-box. The\r\nleft Flank B, being next the wide Side of the Hopper, lies all open,\r\nexcept on the outside of the pricked Lines, where it is covered by the\r\nWood of the End of the Hopper, when it is screwed on to its Place; but\r\nthe Flanch C, on the right Side, will be all covered by the End of the\r\nBox, that will stand upon it, and will reach to the pricked Line that\r\ntouches the Edge of the Mortise. D is the End of the Setting-screw,\r\nappearing in its Place with a Notch, whereby it is to be turned by a\r\nKnife; but I think it better to have an End like a T, to be turned with\r\nthe Fingers. E is one End of the hollow Cylinder, which projects beyond\r\nthe Flanch, that there may be more Room for the Crank to turn (without\r\nstriking against the End of the Hopper, or against the Flanch) on the\r\nOutside of the Box or Hopper; and for that, the longer this Cylinder\r\nis, the better the Brass Spindle will turn in it.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 11. is the Spring-cover, with its Hole, whereby it is screwed\r\ninto its Place, as it is seen marked A, in _Fig._ 9.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12. is the Setting-screw pointing against its Hole, its Head\r\nbeing flat, that it may be turned by the Finger and Thumb.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 13. is the Counter-screw, to be turned in the same manner.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 5. shews the Brass Spindle of the Turnep Seed-box, and the\r\nManner of turning it against its Steel Tongue, or Spring; which Manner\r\nis different from that of turning the larger Spindles for Boxes of a\r\nlarger Size, such as the Wheat Seed-box.\r\n\r\nThis Spindle[266], being but half an Inch Diameter, is too small to\r\nbe turned by the Two Wheels, as the larger Spindles are; not only\r\nbecause it would be in Danger of breaking by the Weight of the Hopper,\r\nand by the Twisting (or Wrenching) of the Wheels; but also because it\r\nwould soon become loose, by wearing the hollow Cylinder thro’ which it\r\npasses; and it would be apt to open the Brass Flanches from the Bottom\r\nof the Hopper, whereby the Seed might run out, beside several other\r\nInconveniencies; all which are prevented by turning the Spindle in the\r\nmanner shewn in this Figure; for here the Spindle never presses against\r\nthe hollow Cylinder, with any greater Force than that of its own\r\nWeight, which is so very little, that the Friction made by it is next\r\nto nothing.\r\n\r\n  [266] I believe, if it were less by a Fourth or Third of its\r\n  Diameter, it might be better, as being more proportionable to the\r\n  Smalness of the Turnep-seed. I have had the Mortise much wider; but\r\n  it cannot well be made much narrower, whilst the Tongue is of this\r\n  Fashion; for this Steel Tongue, if narrower, would either be too\r\n  stiff, or else apt to break, nor would there be Room in the Mortise\r\n  for a sufficient Setting-screw to follow it. But there is another\r\n  Fashion, wherein a narrower Brass Tongue has a broad Spring behind\r\n  it; and when it is in this Manner, the Mortise may be a Fourth of\r\n  the Breadth of this. I have had many of these when I made my Boxes\r\n  in Wood; but cannot describe them by these Cuts; neither are such\r\n  narrow Mortises necessary, unless it were for drilling Tobacco seed,\r\n  Thyme-seed, or some other Sort of an extraordinary Smalness.\r\n\r\nA the Spindle, exactly fitting the Bore of the hollow Cylinder; which,\r\nwhen it enters the said Cylinder at its left End, in _Fig._ 9. will be\r\nstopped by the Wreath B B B; which Wreath, being circular, is cast on\r\nthe Spindle, and is Part of it; the other End of the Spindle will then\r\nappear without the right-hand End of the said hollow Cylinder, at E in\r\n_Fig._ 9. and is kept there by the Wreath _Fig._ 14. which is to be put\r\non upon the End of the Spindle, until it come to the Shoulder at _a_,\r\nwhich Shoulder is exactly even with the End of the hollow Cylinder; so\r\nthat this Wreath will touch the End of the said Cylinder by its whole\r\nSurface. Then, to fix in this Wreath from coming off, we make use of\r\nthe Slider, _Fig._ 15. whose Two Claws A, B, being thrust down by the\r\nTwo Notches of the Spindle, at _b_ and _c_, until its other Part C,\r\nwhich is perpendicular to its Claws, comes down to the Flat of the\r\nSpindle, and environs one half of the Hole, covering the Part of the\r\nFlat which appears of a darker Colour; and then the upper Part of C,\r\nin _Fig._ 15. makes one level Surface with the Flat D of the Spindle;\r\nand then the Iron Fork E, being screwed into the Hole F, holds down the\r\nSlider fast, so that it cannot rise up; and then the Spindle, being in\r\nits Place, will run round without moving endways, being confined by\r\nthese Wreaths.\r\n\r\nThe Spindle being thus placed, so that it may turn easily, we place the\r\nSeed-box upon its Flanches with its Bottom upwards; and then setting\r\none sharp Point of a Pair of Compasses, or some such Instrument, upon\r\nthe Spindle, within the Mortise, close to the Edge of the Hole or\r\nEllipse at the End of the transverse Ax, turn round the Spindle, until\r\nthe said Point makes a Mark round the Spindle, which will be a Circle;\r\nby the same means make such another Mark at the opposite Ax; then\r\nunscrew the Fork, and take out the Slider, pull off the Wreath, and\r\ntake out the Spindle, and cut the Notches between the Two said Circles\r\nand Marks; the Edges of the Ends of the Notches must be Arches of these\r\nCircles. These Notches should differ from those already described in\r\nthe Wheat-drill, in nothing but the Smalness of their Dimensions; their\r\nDepth should be about the Thickness of a Turnep-seed, or something\r\ndeeper. The Breadth of their Bottoms is uncertain, and must be greater\r\nor less according to their greater or less Number; but we commonly have\r\nSeven or Eight Notches, and make them about the Breadth in which they\r\nappear in this Figure; but whatever their Number be, they must be all\r\nequal, and so must all their Interstices.\r\n\r\nG is the End of a wooden Spindle, thro’ which passes the Iron Crank H,\r\nand is fastened to it by its Screw and Nut, at _d_; Part of which Crank\r\nenters the Wood at _e_, which prevents its Turning in the Spindle.\r\n\r\nThis Crank, by its other End, passing thro’ the Two Legs of the Fork E,\r\nand equally distant from the Top and Bottom of it, turns the Spindle\r\nby the Motion of the Wheel which is fixed on the other End of the\r\nwooden Spindle. If this Crank were to turn the Spindle by a single Pin,\r\ninstead of this Fork, the Seed could never be delivered out equally to\r\nthe Ground; for as soon as the Pin began to descend, and decline from\r\nbeing perpendicular to the Horizon, it would, by its own Weight falling\r\ndown, turn the Spindle half round in a Moment, and there remain with\r\nits other End downwards perpendicular to the Horizon under the Spindle,\r\nuntil the Crank reached it there, and so no Seed would be turned out by\r\none Semicircle of the Wheel, and a double Proportion would be turned\r\nout to the Land that was measured by the other Semicircle; but the\r\nhinder Leg of the Fork, bearing against the hinder Part of the Crank,\r\nprevents this Inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Line _f g_ is Part of the Surface of a Board, thro’ which the\r\nwooden Spindle passes, and by which it is held in its Place; as shall\r\nbe shewn hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe Axis of this wooden Spindle ought to fall into a Line with the\r\nAxis of this Brass Spindle; but, unless Care be taken to prevent it,\r\nthe wooden Spindle will so much wear the Hole thro’ which it passes,\r\nand be worn by it, as to have Room in the Hole to deviate from this\r\nExactness, and may descend so low, that the Crank may come out of the\r\nEnds of the Fork; and for this Reason it is, that the Fork is made so\r\nlong as it is; but when this wooden Spindle does, by the Contrivances\r\nhereafter shewn, keep its Axis in a Line with the Axis of the Brass\r\nSpindle, or very nearly so, then the Legs of the Fork need be no longer\r\nthan half an Inch; and in that Case, the Joint of the Crank, which is\r\nperpendicular to the Spindle, must be shorter, or else descend deeper\r\ninto the Wood, so that its End, which turns the Fork, may be in the\r\nMiddle betwixt its Bottom and the End of its Legs.\r\n\r\nThe Use of the other End of the Spindle is this: When we have a mind\r\nthat it should be turned by the left Wheel instead of the right, we\r\nscrew in the Fork into the Hole I, and place a short Screw in the room\r\nof the Fork, to hold down the Slider.\r\n\r\n_Note_, It is not absolutely necessary, that the hollow Cylinder, which\r\nappears on the Sides of the Seed-box, should both, or either of them,\r\nproject farther than the Flanches; but I think it better that it should\r\ndo so, at least, on that Side which is next to the Fork.\r\n\r\nThis Cylinder should be bored as true, and as even, as the Barrel of a\r\nFusil is bored: and the Edges and Surfaces of its Ends must be smooth,\r\nand without Jaggs, to the end that the Wreaths may turn glibly against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Figure or Shape of all Sorts of Seeds disposes them, more or less,\r\nto form an Arch, when they are pressed from above, and confined on all\r\nSides.\r\n\r\nThe most effectual Way to prevent this is, to take care, whenever many\r\nSeeds are to descend together by their own Gravity thro’ a narrow\r\nPassage, that such Passage be never narrower downwards than upwards;\r\nbut, on the contrary, that it be wider downwards, on some or one of its\r\nSides; in which Case, if the Surfaces of all the Sides of this Passage\r\nbe smooth, it is impossible, that Seeds should of themselves form an\r\nArch therein.\r\n\r\nOn this Maxim depends the infallible Performance of a Drill, and from\r\nhence are derived the Uses of the Bevel of the Mortise: What I mean by\r\nthe Word Bevel, in general, has been already defined.\r\n\r\nThe Bevel of the Mortise of the Seed-box is that Inclination of its\r\nSides, whereby it is wider downwards, and narrower upwards; by which\r\nmeans the Seed is prevented from arching in the Mortise before it\r\ndescends to the Notches of the Spindle. And this is the First Use of\r\nour Bevel; for this Arching might happen in the Mortise, if the Planes\r\nof its Sides were parallel to each other; and would be unavoidable, if\r\ntheir Inclination were downwards, as it is upwards; but these Planes\r\nopening downwards, the lower the Seed descends, the more Room it has\r\nto expand; so that the very Weight, which would otherwise cause it to\r\narch and stop, does by means of this Bevel force it to descend to the\r\nNotches, and then it is safe from all manner of Danger of stopping. The\r\nEnds of the Mortise are at such a great Distance from each other, and\r\nthe Cover so very thin, as to lie almost even with the upper Part of\r\nthe Spindle, that the Seed can never form an Arch that way; or, if it\r\ndid, the continual Motion of the Tongue would immediately break it down\r\nat the Fore-end of the Mortise.\r\n\r\nThe Second Use of this Bevel is, that it gives room for the Tongue to\r\nbe in the same manner bevel, tho’ in a less Degree: By this means, the\r\nSeed cannot by any Impediment be stopped in its oblique Descent to the\r\nNotches, from the Fore-end, and all that other Length of the Mortise,\r\nalong and upon the Surface of the Tongue.\r\n\r\nBut if the Mortise had not this Bevel, the Tongue could not have it;\r\nfor then either the upper Surface of the Tongue must have no Bevel at\r\nall, which would destroy the Two empty Triangles which ought to be on\r\nits Sides; or else it must have a Bevel the contrary Way (_i. e._ a\r\nBevel reversed), and be narrower downwards than upwards, which would\r\ncause the Seed to arch thereon, and hinder its free Descent to the\r\nNotches.\r\n\r\nA Third great Use of this Bevel is, that, besides the Bevel of the\r\nTongue aforementioned, it gives place for Two empty Triangles, one on\r\neach Side the Tongue, which have each its vertical Angle extremely\r\nacute at the Axis of the Tongue, and have their Bases at the Bottom\r\nof the Mortise, and of the Tongue: These Triangles are also Bevels,\r\nwhich consist of the Difference, or Complement, of the Bevel of the\r\nTongue, and that of the Mortise, the latter being about One-third\r\ngreater than the former; _i. e._ One-third of the whole Bevel of the\r\nMortise is divided between these Two Triangles, to each a Sixth Part;\r\nso that if the Angle of Inclination of the Sides of the Mortise were\r\nNine Degrees, then the vertical Angle of each of these empty Triangles\r\nwould be of One Degree and Thirty Minutes, and Six Degrees, would be\r\nleft for the Bevel of the Tongue. And these triangular Spaces help to\r\nsecure the free Motion of the Tongue, and free Descent of the Seed\r\ndown its Surface; because they permit no Impediment to lodge in them,\r\nthey being, by means of the Bevel of the Mortise, wider downwards,\r\nboth obliquely and perpendicularly, so that no Dust, nor whatever else\r\nhappens to get in betwixt the Tongue and the Side of the Mortise, can\r\nrest there; for it will be immediately removed thence by the Motion\r\nof the Tongue, and its own Gravity, and either thrown perpendicularly\r\ndown, or else obliquely to the Notches, and the first Notch that takes\r\nit will carry it out at the Seed-passage.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Use of the Bevel is, that thereby the Sections of the hollow\r\nCylinder (before described) do form Ellipses instead of Circles; which\r\nthey must have been, if cut parallel to the Bases of that Cylinder; and\r\nthe Sections must have been thus parallel, had the Mortise been without\r\nany Bevel.\r\n\r\nNow the Two Semi-ellipses, which are on the Fore-sides of their longest\r\nAxes or Diameters, and next to the Tongue, are opposite to, and do\r\nstill uniformly depart from each other, even from the upper End of\r\ntheir said longest Axis, until they arrive at the lower End of the\r\nsame Axis, which is below the Seed-passage, as its upper End is very\r\nnear the Cover.\r\n\r\nThis Opening of these opposite Semi-ellipses makes it impossible for\r\nany thing, of itself, to get into the remaining Parts of this hollow\r\nCylinder, betwixt them and the solid Cylinder, call’d the Spindle,\r\nwhich turns continually therein, when the Wheels are going: For you\r\nwill see, that if you make a Mark on the Spindle, close to the Side of\r\nthe Mortise, at the upper End of the longest Ax of the Ellipse; and\r\nthen turn the Spindle until this Mark come against the lower End of the\r\nsame Ax; and there make another Mark on the Spindle, close to the Side\r\nof the Mortise; and draw a Line from one Mark to the other, parallel to\r\nthe Ax of the Spindle, which will be the Measure of that Part of the\r\nBevel of the Diameter of the Hole; every Point in this Line will, by an\r\nintire Revolution of the Spindle, generate a Circle, which will cut the\r\nEllipse in Two Places, once on the Foreside of its longest Axis, and\r\nonce on the Back-side or hinder Half of it; and that all these Points,\r\nin this Surface of the Spindle, described by these Circles, will enter\r\nthe Hole, by the said hinder Semi-ellipse, as the Spindle there turns\r\nupwards (as it always does); and they will all again come out on the\r\nfore Semi-ellipse, as they descend towards the lower End of the said Ax\r\nof the Ellipse.\r\n\r\nAs these Points thus come out of the Hole, or (if I may use the\r\nExpression) as they emerge, they oppose every thing that would\r\nenter the Hole, they still moving from the Hole, and push away from\r\nit whatever they meet; nay, if any thing were in the Hole, these\r\nPoints (whereof this Surface consists) would bring it out by this\r\nSemi-ellipse, which is always press’d by the Seed when the Drill is at\r\nWork; but as these Points immerge by the other Semi-ellipsis which is\r\nbehind the Spindle, they can carry with them into the Hole nothing\r\nbut Air, because the Cover never suffers any thing else to come there\r\nfrom above; and the Seed falls out of the Notches by its own Gravity,\r\njust before it reaches the lower End of the transverse Ax, being the\r\nPlace where the opposite Ellipses are farthest asunder; and none of it\r\nis ever carried so far back as the hinder Semi-ellipses; and therefore\r\nnothing can be carried into the Hole from below.\r\n\r\nThus that Part of the Surface of the Spindle will keep the Hole empty\r\nand clear, before ever any Notches are cut; but when the Notches are\r\nmade on the Spindle, they have yet a much greater Force to drive and\r\nexpel whatever would enter the Hole, their Shape being such as nothing\r\ncan enter against their bevel Ends; but what is at their Ends will be\r\nthrown presently into the Mortise; insomuch that when a Spindle has\r\nbeen too little for the Hole by a Quarter of an Inch, that is, a sixth\r\nPart of the Diameter of the Hole, it will perform very well in drilling\r\nlarge Species of Seeds; and when the Mortise is run empty, nothing at\r\nall is found in the Hole, it being thus kept void and clean by the\r\nNotches.\r\n\r\n_Note_, That what is here, and elsewhere, said of the Ellipse of the\r\none Side of the Mortise, must be understood the same of its opposite\r\nEllipse, on the opposite Side of the Mortise.\r\n\r\nAll these Advantages accruing from this Bevel of the Mortise, I believe\r\nthat, without it, all Attempts of making a Machine to perform the Work,\r\nwhich this does, would have been vain.\r\n\r\nThere is also within the Mortise unavoidably another Bevel, which is as\r\nthe Reverse of the former, and notwithstanding is as useful; and this\r\nBevel is, the Inclination which Part of the curvilineal Surface of the\r\nSpindle, beginning a little above the fore End of the shortest Diameter\r\nof the Ellipses, and descending down to the Seed-passage, has to the\r\nlower Part of the Surface of the Tongue opposite against it. These Two\r\nSurfaces meeting one another below, when the Tongue is set up close\r\nto the Spindle, form a mix’d Angle, which stops up the Seed-passage,\r\nexcept when a Notch comes against it.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tongue is set from the Spindle, to the Distance of several\r\nDiameters of one of the Seeds that are to be drill’d, this revers’d\r\nBevel causes the Seed to arch at the Seed-passage, and stop there, till\r\nthe Notches force it thro’, which would, without this Arching, fall out\r\nby its own Gravity, without the Turning of the Wheels.\r\n\r\nThe Seed arches here the more firmly, the more it is press’d upon by\r\nthe incumbent Seed from above it; and the former Bevel (which I call\r\nthe Bevel of the Mortise) permits the incumbent Weight to press the\r\nharder on the Seed that is near the Seed-passage; and this might be\r\nreckon’d a fifth Use of the former Bevel: For as it prevents the Seed\r\nfrom arching in any other Part of the Mortise, so it does, by the same\r\nmeans, cause it to arch the more strongly at the Seed-passage, which is\r\nsometimes (_viz._ when the Tongue must be set wide) as necessary, as\r\nit is for it to escape arching before it comes thither. And the more\r\nstrongly this Arch presses against the Tongue, the more the Tongue by\r\nits Spring presses against it; and this Pressure being reciprocal and\r\nequal, the Seed cannot fall out spontaneously; for when the Passage is\r\nthus wide, if you throw into the Mortise a few Seeds, suppose Five or\r\nSix at a time only, they will all pass through immediately, without any\r\nMotion of the Wheels; but if you throw in a large Quantity together,\r\nthere will only a few of the lowermost fall through, unless the Wheels\r\ndo turn and throw them down by the force of the Notches.\r\n\r\nIndeed we do not care to set the Tongue so very wide from the Spindle,\r\nunless it be when we are obliged to plant a very much larger Proportion\r\nof Seed than the Notches are design’d for, and when we have no\r\nOpportunity of changing the Wheels for such as are lower, nor of\r\nchanging the Spindle for another that has greater or more Notches in it.\r\n\r\nFour-and-twenty Gallons of large Peas are as proper a Proportion to\r\ndrill on an Acre, as Six Gallons of Wheat are.\r\n\r\nThere are divers Ways to vary (_i. e._ increase or diminish) the\r\nProportion of Seed; as, First, by the Setting-screw, with which we can,\r\nwithout any Inconveniency, set the Tongue so far from the Spindle, as\r\nto permit one Round of the Notches to turn out Four times the Quantity,\r\nas it will do when the Tongue is set close up to the Spindle; and thus\r\nwe can vary the Proportion by innumerable intermediate Degrees.\r\n\r\nNext, if we would increase the Proportion yet farther, we can inlarge\r\nthe Notches; but we cannot add to their Number, unless there be room\r\nto double it, by making a new Notch between every Two; but we cannot\r\ndiminish the Proportion of Seed by the same Notches, because they\r\ncannot be made lesser or fewer.\r\n\r\nIf we would make any other Alteration in the Proportion of Seed by the\r\nNotches, it must be done by making another Set of them; which we may\r\ndo, because the wooden Spindle may have Three Rows of Notches in it,\r\nof which we may use either, by moving the Wreaths and Wheels towards\r\none End or the other of the wooden Spindle; as shall be shewn in the\r\nDescriptions of the Hoppers.\r\n\r\nBut as for the Brass Spindle of the Turnep-drill, we can have but one\r\nSet of Notches in it[267]: And therefore, tho’ we can increase the\r\nProportion of Seed by enlarging the Notches, or perhaps by doubling\r\ntheir Number; yet we cannot lessen the Proportion of Seed by the\r\nNotches, unless we have a new Set of them, and that will occasion a\r\nNecessity of having another Spindle; but, as to the Setting-screw of\r\nthe Turnep-drill, it will increase the Proportion of Seed with the same\r\nNotches, much more than the Setting-screw of the Wheat-drill will do.\r\n\r\n  [267] But by putting on a Wreath (that is a little broader than the\r\n  Mortise) upon the Spindle (made longer for that Purpose) we can, by\r\n  changing this Wreath from one End of the Spindle to the other, have\r\n  Two sets of Notches of different Sizes, and of different Numbers in\r\n  it: Or if we would have Three Sets, we need only make Use of Two such\r\n  Wreaths, and let the Spindle be long enough to receive them. So we\r\n  may use which Set we please.\r\n\r\n  Tho’ several Sets of Notches may be useful to those who drill many\r\n  Sorts of fine Seeds different in Magnitude in a very great Degree;\r\n  yet I never found more than one Set of Notches necessary in this\r\n  Spindle.\r\n\r\n  Nor have I used any more than one Set of Notches in one Mortise of\r\n  any Sort; but in a wide Mortise, there may be made a double Set of\r\n  Notches, consisting of Two Rows, all of equal Bigness, and half of\r\n  the Length, and double the Number of a single Row, one End of each\r\n  Notch reaching to the Middle of the Mortise, and pointing against the\r\n  End of an Interstice, that is between Two or its opposite Notches.\r\n\r\n  If ever there shall be Occasion for this Sort of Notches, it must be\r\n  when a great Proportion of Seed is to be drill’d by a small Spindle,\r\n  and low Wheels: The Smalness of the Spindle may not, by a single Set,\r\n  admit of a sufficient Number of Notches (of a proper Bigness) in its\r\n  Circumference; not that a double Set, by its double Number, will\r\n  throw down a greater Quantity of Seed than a single Set of the same\r\n  Width and Depth, but a less Quantity; But it may be feared, that a\r\n  very small Number of Notches might not spread the Seed so much as to\r\n  cause it to lie even in the Chanels, one Notchful falling all to the\r\n  Ground, before any of the next Notchful reaches it, which would make\r\n  Chasms or Gaps in the Row of Corn or Legumes: This, such a double\r\n  Number of Notches will certainly prevent.\r\n\r\n  It would seem, that the higher the Wheels, the more need there should\r\n  be for this double Set of Notches: But it appears to be otherwise;\r\n  for the greater Distance the Seed has to fall, the more it spreads,\r\n  and strikes oftener against the Funnel and Trunk; and by that means a\r\n  Notch from high Wheels will, with the same Quantity of Seed, supply a\r\n  greater Length of the Chanel (or Furrow) than a Notch will from low\r\n  Wheels.\r\n\r\n  In all my Practice I never had any Occasion for such a double Set of\r\n  Notches, either with high or low Wheels, or even when I drilled into\r\n  open Chanels, without Funnels or Trunks to my Drill-plough; and yet\r\n  my Rows of St. Foin, and of Corn, were always free from Gaps, being\r\n  equally supply’d with Seed from one End to the other.\r\n\r\n  If ever there is Occasion for more than a single Set, it must be for\r\n  Beans, for which also I think a large Spindle is better than a double\r\n  Set of Notches in a small one. The largest Spindle I have known made,\r\n  is of Two Inches and an half Diameter, and that only for Horse-Beans.\r\n\r\n  The best Sort of Notches for a double Set are those which have convex\r\n  Bottoms; because such are less liable to drop their Seeds without the\r\n  turning of the Wheels, than any other Sort: And a double Set must\r\n  be in greater Danger of this, as the Tongue is always hindered from\r\n  pressing so closely against any Notch, being held open by the Seeds\r\n  on the opposite Interstice; which is contrary to a single Set, where\r\n  no Seed can lodge at either End of a Notch, to hold open the Tongue,\r\n  or hinder its pressing against it.\r\n\r\n  _Note_, When I made my Boxes of Wood, I had double Boxes, with a\r\n  Partition between such a double Set of Notches; but never made such\r\n  in Brass, not knowing whether that Partition, by its Thinness of hard\r\n  Metal, might not cut the Spindle: Yet I never found any Occasion for\r\n  a double Row of Notches. I made those double Boxes only for drilling\r\n  Two Sorts of Seeds at once into the same Chanel.\r\n\r\nThe other Way of varying the Proportion of Seed in the same Boxes, is\r\nby the Diameter of the Wheels, when we can alter them; for Wheels, of\r\nwhat Diameter soever they are, must turn round all the Notches at one\r\nRevolution; so that Wheels of Twenty Inches Diameter will deliver out\r\na third Part more Seed than Wheels of Thirty Inches Diameter, into the\r\nsame Length of the Chanels; but we seldom have any Occasion to alter\r\nthe Wheels, unless it be on account of planting a Species of Seed of\r\na different Magnitude, as the largest Sort of Peas, and small-grain’d\r\nWheat, or St. Foin Seed are.\r\n\r\nThese are all the Ways we have to alter the Proportion of Seed, we\r\ndrill with the same Seed-boxes; these Two Sizes, already described,\r\nbeing sufficient for all Sorts of Corn and Seeds which we commonly sow,\r\nfrom Marrow-peas to Turnep-seed; but, for drilling of Beans, the Boxes\r\nmust be larger, and are commonly made of Wood, the Spindle Two Inches\r\nDiameter, or more, and the Boxes Two Inches wide: Where note, That this\r\nIncreasing of the Width of the Mortise, from an Inch and an half, to\r\nTwo Inches, increases the Quantity of Seed to almost double; because\r\nthis Half Inch is all added to the Middle of the Notches, where they\r\nare deeper than their Ends; the Bevel of which takes up a considerable\r\nPart of the Length of the Notches. For Beans, they also contrive to\r\nhave their Wheels as low as conveniently they can. These Wooden Drills\r\nare now become common in many Places.\r\n\r\nThe Wooden and Brass Seed-boxes differ not in any of the most essential\r\nParts of them; only the Wooden Box must be thicker, as the Wood is not\r\nso strong as Brass; the Spring is made strait instead of crooked; and,\r\nbeing let into the Back of the Wooden Tongue, bears against it at each\r\nEnd; and the Chanel, into which it is placed, being made hollow in the\r\nMiddle, the Spring has its Play there, and must be stiffer and have a\r\nlittle more Play in the Bean-drill, than in any lesser Seed-box.\r\n\r\nI, at first, made all my Seed-boxes of dry Box-tree Wood, which\r\nperformed very well, and are still used: But, a few Years ago, a\r\nGentleman advised me to make them in Brass; the doing of which has put\r\nme to a great deal of Trouble and Expence, for want of understanding\r\nthe Founder’s Art: Yet this I do not repent, because they are, in some\r\nrespect, better than those made in Wood; especially to those who do not\r\nwell understand their Fabric; for, to such, the Swelling and Shrinking\r\nof the Wood was inconvenient in small Boxes: And I now am told, that\r\nthey are cast in _London_ of the best Brass, at the Price of One\r\nShilling _per_ Pound, and so smooth as to require very little filing.\r\nAnd these Brass Boxes being also more lasting than Wood, and not much\r\nmore expensive, when Workmen know how to make them, I think it not\r\nworth while to give any particular Directions for making them in Wood.\r\n\r\nAs to the Spindles of the Turnep-boxes, I have often made them with a\r\nmix’d Metal, of half Pewter, and half Spelter, which perform very well,\r\nand are easily made; because this Metal will melt, almost as soon as\r\nLead, in a Fire-shovel, to be cast in a Mould; but Brass will not melt\r\nwithout a Crucible.\r\n\r\nThe first Idea that I form’d of this Machine, was thus: I imagin’d the\r\nMortise, or Groove, brought from the Sound-board of an Organ, together\r\nwith the Tongue and Spring, all of them much alter’d; the Mortise\r\nhaving an Hole therein, and put on upon one of the Iron Gudgeons of\r\nthe Wheelbarrow; which Gudgeon being enlarg’d to an Inch and an half\r\nDiameter, having on it the Notches of the Cylinder of a Cyder-mill, on\r\nthat Part of it which should be within the Mortise, and this Mortise\r\nmade in the Ear of the Wheelbarrow (thro’ which the Gudgeon usually\r\npasses), made broad enough for the Purpose; this I hoped, for any thing\r\nI saw to the contrary, might perform this Work of Drilling; and herein\r\nI was not deceived.\r\n\r\nAs for placing a Box over this Mortise to carry a sufficient Quantity\r\nof Seed, it was a thing so obvious, that it occasion’d very little\r\nThought; and an Instrument for making the Chanels, not much more;\r\nneither for applying Two Wheels, one at each End of the Axis, instead\r\nof the single Wheel in the Middle of the Axis of the Wheelbarrow.\r\n\r\nAt first my Plough made open Chanels, and was very rude, being composed\r\nof Four rough Pieces of Planks, of little Value, held together by Three\r\nShoots, or Pieces of Wood, which held them at a Foot Distance one from\r\nthe other; These Pieces, being cut sharp at Bottom, made the Chanels\r\ntolerably well in fine Ground. But I soon contrived a Plough with Four\r\nIron Shares, to make Chanels in any Ground: This drew a Hopper after\r\nit, having Four Seed-boxes at its Bottom, carried on a Spindle by Two\r\nlow Wheels, which had Liberty to rise and sink by the Clods that they\r\npass’d over: The Seed-boxes delivered their Seed immediately into the\r\nopen Chanels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate. 3_\r\n\r\n_P. 344_\r\n\r\n_W Thorpe sculp._]\r\n\r\nThis Plough and Hopper were drawn by an Horse, and the Seed, lying\r\nopen in the Chanels, was covered sometimes by a very light Harrow, and\r\nsometimes by an Hurdle stuck with Bushes underneath it.\r\n\r\nI soon improv’d this Plough to perform better, and to make Six Chanels\r\nat once, and sometimes a great many more.\r\n\r\nThis Plough and Hopper, with their Improvements and Alterations, are\r\nshewn in _Plates_ 4. and 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXI.\r\n\r\nOf the _Wheat-Drill_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 1. in _Plate_ 4. is the Drill-plough, which makes the Chanels\r\nfor a treble Row of Wheat, at Seven-inch Partitions, and covers the\r\nSeed by the Harrow which moves on its Beams. A, is the Plank, Three\r\nFeet and an half long, Eight Inches and an half broad, one Inch and a\r\nquarter thick; its upper and under Surfaces are true Planes. B, B, the\r\nTwo Beams, each Two Feet Four Inches long, Two Inches Three quarters\r\nbroad, and Two Inches and a quarter deep, standing under the Plank at\r\nright Angles with it, and held up to it by the Four Screws and Nuts\r\n_a_₂ _a_₂ _a_₂ _a_₂ the one being at the same Distance from the right,\r\nas the other is from the left End of the Plank.\r\n\r\nThis Plough makes its Chanels by Three Sheats, and their Shares and\r\nTrunks; the First or Foremost of which Sheats stands under the Middle\r\nof the Plank, with Part of it appearing at _b_; and is fully describ’d\r\nin _Fig._ 2, where A is the Tenon, of a convenient Size, Two Inches\r\nbroad between Shoulder and Shoulder, Three quarters of an Inch thick:\r\nIt is driven into the Plank thro’ a Mortise, and pinn’d up by its Hole:\r\nIt stands thus obliquely, and pointing forwards, that it may stand the\r\nmore out of the Way of the Funnel. The Shoulder at _a_ is a quarter\r\nof an Inch. The hinder Shoulder, from the Tenon to the Angle at _b_,\r\nis Three quarters of an Inch. The Depth of the Back of the Sheat, and\r\nThickness of the Share, when it is on, from _b_ to _c_, is Nine Inches\r\nand a quarter; and the Angle at _c_ must be a right Angle, contrary to\r\nthe Opinion of some, who fansy it ought to be acute, supposing that\r\nwhen this Angle is right, whilst the Seed is descending by the Back of\r\nthe Sheat, the Plough, as it moves forwards, would get before the Seed,\r\nand so it might fall to the Ground behind the Trunk; but this Mistake\r\nis for want of considering the vast Disproportion between the Celerity\r\nof the Seed’s descending near the Earth, and the slow Progress of the\r\nPlough; the Seed descending at the Rate of Sixteen Feet in a Second of\r\nTime, and the Plough proceeding but about Three Miles an Hour, does not\r\nadvance the Thickness of a Seed, whilst it is falling to the Ground by\r\nthe whole Depth of the Sheat.\r\n\r\nThe Thickness of the Sheat is an Inch, at its upper Part. The rest of\r\nit is to be no thicker than the Breadth of the Share.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 3. is the Share, lying Bottom upwards. _a_ is its Point. _b_ the\r\nSocket, Three Inches long, Seven Sixteenths of an Inch broad. _c_ is\r\nthe Hole, by which it is fastened up to the Sheat. _d_ is another Hole,\r\nwhich is never made use of, except when the Share, being fasten’d up\r\nby the other Hole, inclines to either Side; then we draw it right by\r\na Nail driven into this Hole. _e_, _e_, are Two very small Notches,\r\ninto which the Sides of the Trunk are jointed, to protect them from\r\nbeing torn out by the Earth or Stones that might rub against them, _f_\r\nis the Tail of the Share, which, when it is in its Place, will make\r\nthe right Angle before described in _Fig._ 2. and from which Tail, to\r\nthe Fore-part of the Socket, is the Length of the Bottom of the Sheat,\r\n_viz._ Six Inches and an half. The Breadth of the Share Three quarters\r\nof an Inch.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 4. shews one Side of the Share. The prick’d Line _a e_ shews\r\nthe Bevel of the Fore-end of the Socket, the upper Edge of which must\r\nbear upon the Fore-part of the Sheat below _f_ in _Fig._ 2. and the\r\nother Part of the Share will bear against the Bottom of the Sheat, from\r\n_d_ to _c_, and will be fastened up by a flat Nail, passing thro’ the\r\nforemost Hole of the Share, and entering the Hole _g_ in the Sheat;\r\nwhich Nail being bended in the said Hole (which Hole should be at\r\nleast an Inch Diameter) will hold the Share fast to the Sheat; and, by\r\nunbending this Nail, the Share may be easily taken off, upon Occasion,\r\nwithout damaging the Sheat. _Note_, This Hole in the Share ought to be\r\nwider below than above, and the Head of the Nail of the same Shape; or\r\nelse, as the Share wears thinner, it might come off. The prick’d Line,\r\nnear the Fore-part of the Sheat, shews where a Shoulder must be cut on\r\neach Side of it, because otherwise the Sheat, being thicker than the\r\nBreadth of the Socket of the Share, could not enter it: But take care,\r\nthat the Share do not bear against these Shoulders.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 5. is one Side of the Trunk, being a thin Plate of Iron, and is\r\noften made of the Blade of an old Scythe: It is to be riveted on to\r\none Side of the Sheat, to another of the same on the opposite Side, by\r\nThree Rivets passing thro’ them both, with the Sheat in the Middle of\r\nthem; which Holes appear both in the Plate and in the Sheat. These\r\nthus riveted on do form the Trunk at the Back of the Sheat. The whole\r\nBreadth of this Plate is an Inch and Three quarters; but Three-eighths\r\nof an Inch being riveted on to the Sheat, there remains but an Inch\r\nand Three-eighths for the Trunk. The Length of the Plate is the same\r\nwith the Depth of the Sheat and Share, except that it should not reach\r\nto the Bottom of the Share, by about the Thickness of a Barley-corn,\r\nto the end that it may not bear against the Ground, as the Share doth.\r\nThe Notch at the Bottom of the Plate is that which answers the Notch in\r\nthe Tail of the Share: The Corner of the Plate at _a_ we make a little\r\nroundish, that it may not wear against the Ground.\r\n\r\nThis Plate thus riveted on the Sheat, and another of the same Form\r\non the other Side opposite to it, compose the Trunk, which is _Fig._\r\n6. _a d_ is the Edge _a b_ of the Plate _Fig._ 5. _b c_ is the like\r\nEdge of the opposite Side of the Trunk. A is the Back of the Sheat,\r\nwhich, together with the Tail of the Share when in its Place, makes\r\nthe Fore-part or Length of the Trunk. The Thickness of this Back of\r\nthe Sheat is the Width of the Trunk; and from this Back of the Sheat\r\nto the said Edges of the Plates, may be call’d the Depth of the Trunk.\r\nThe upper Ends of these Two Plates _a_ and _b_ we spread open a quarter\r\nof an Inch wider, for half an Inch down, than the rest of the Trunk,\r\nfor the more free Reception of the Seed from the Hole of the Funnel: We\r\nlikewise take care, that the Two lower hinder Concerns of the Trunk do\r\nnot incline to one another, to make the Trunk narrower than the Back\r\nof the Sheat, lest the Earth should be held in by them, and fill the\r\nBottom of the Trunk.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. is one of the hinder Sheats, and appears, in part, at _c_ in\r\n_Fig._ 1. It is fastened into one of the Beams by its Tenon, which,\r\nbeing driven into a Mortise, is pinn’d in by a Pin passing thro’ the\r\nBeam, and the Tenon cut off even with the upper Surface of the Beam:\r\nThis Tenon stands more oblique than that of the fore Sheat, that there\r\nmay be the more Wood between its Mortise and the Funnel, its hinder\r\nShoulder being short: Its fore Shoulder at _a_ must be very short, not\r\nabove the Eighth of an Inch; but its Shoulder _b_ Three quarters of an\r\nInch. The Tenon is also shoulder’d on each Side, as well as before and\r\nbehind. The Thickness of this Sheat should be greater than that of the\r\nFore-sheat, because it is much narrower. The Depth of this Sheat, is\r\nless than the Fore-sheat, by the Depth of the Beam: It is, in all other\r\nrespects, the same with the Fore-sheat, except that it and its Share\r\nare shorter. The Socket of this Share is but an Inch and One-eighth\r\nlong, its Breadth half an Inch, and from the Fore-part of the Bottom of\r\nthe Socket to the End of its Tail, but three Inches. Its Point from the\r\nSocket at Bottom is but Three quarters of an Inch, whereas the Point\r\nof the Fore-share is an Inch and Three quarters: There is but one Hole\r\nwhereby the Share is fastened up to the Sheat. Its Trunk is no wider\r\nthan the other; for we cut a Rabbet on each Side of the Sheat, that\r\nthe Plates, which are the Sides of the Trunk, may come within Three\r\nquarters of an Inch of one another. Its Tenon, being narrower than the\r\nTenon of the Fore-sheat, must be thicker than it.\r\n\r\nThe other Hinder-sheat, and all its Accoutrements, must be the same as\r\nthis of _Fig._ 7.\r\n\r\nThe Workman must take care, that the Tenons of the Sheats be not made\r\ncross the Grain of the Wood; and therefore must make them of crooked\r\nTimber.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. shews how the Share is made of Four Pieces; of which _a_ is\r\na Piece of Steel for the Point, its larger End being cut bevel for the\r\nShape of the Fore-end of the Socket. _b_ is a Piece of Iron for the\r\nother End of the Share, from the Socket to the Tail: The other Two\r\nPieces _c_ and _d_ are the Iron Sides, which, being welded on to the\r\nother Two Pieces, and cut off to the Length, form the Share, with its\r\nSocket, more exact than it can be made out of one Piece of Iron.\r\n\r\nNow we return to the first Figure; where the Fore-sheat being fix’d\r\nup at equal Distance from each End of the Plank, and as near to the\r\nhinder Edges of it as can be, allowing room for the Funnel C to stand\r\nwith the Fore-side of its Hole, to make one Surface with the Back of\r\nthe Sheat, and for the hinder Part of the Trunk not to reach the Edge\r\nof the Plank, there must be also room for the Fore-standard D to stand\r\nperpendicular to the Plank, across the Tenon of the Sheat.\r\n\r\nThis Standard being close to the Fore-side of the fore Hopper, there\r\nmust be so much room between it and the Hole of the Funnel, that the\r\nSeed may drop from the Seed-box into the Middle of this Hole. Thus much\r\nfor placing the Fore-sheat.\r\n\r\nNext, for the Two hinder Sheats; they must be placed at equal Distance\r\nfrom the Sides of the Beams, and so near to the hinder Ends of the\r\nBeams, that there may be room to make the Funnels in them, and their\r\nTenons to come up between their respective Funnels E and F, and their\r\nrespective Standards G and H, which Standards must be set perpendicular\r\nto the Beams.\r\n\r\nThe Distance of these Sheats from the Plank must be such, that the\r\nWheels of the hinder Hopper may not strike against the Plank, nor\r\nagainst the Spindle of the fore Hopper; and the Semidiameters of these\r\nWheels being Eleven Inches, there ought to be a Foot between the Centre\r\nof each Wheel and the Plank; but we sometimes cut Notches in the Plank,\r\nto prevent the Circle of the Wheels from coming too near the Plank.\r\n\r\nFor the nearer the hinder Sheats stand to the Plank, the better; but\r\nthese Beams may be placed nearer to, or farther from the Plank, by\r\ntheir Screws and Nuts, at Pleasure.\r\n\r\nThese Beams must be set at such a Distance from one another, that the\r\nShares may be Fifteen Inches asunder from the Inside of one to the\r\nOutside of the other.\r\n\r\nTo try whether all these Sheats and Shares are truly placed, set the\r\nPlough upon a level Surface; and then, if they be right, the Fore-share\r\nwill touch the Surface by its Point and Tail, and likewise the hinder\r\nSheats will do the same; except that some Workmen will have it, that\r\nthe Plough goes better, when the Tails of the hinder Sheats are a\r\nBarley-corn’s Thickness higher than their Points; and then their Tails\r\nwill want so much of touching the Surface.\r\n\r\nThe Shares must be all of them parallel to the Beams, and consequently\r\nto one another.\r\n\r\nThe Chanel made by the fore Share and Sheat for the middle Row, being\r\nat equal Distance between the Two hinder Sheats, is cover’d by them,\r\nthey raising the Mould over the Seed from each Side of this Chanel.\r\n\r\nThe Harrow I is drawn by the Beams, to which it is fastened to their\r\nInsides at _d_ and _e_, having each a small Iron Pin, passing thro’\r\neach End of the Legs of the Harrow, and thro’ the Beams; each having a\r\nNut on the Outsides of the Beams, and being square in the Beams, that\r\nthey may not turn therein to loosen their Nuts; but are round near\r\ntheir Heads, that the Harrow may easily move thereon.\r\n\r\nThe round Ends of the Legs of the Harrow are put thro’ its Head I, at\r\nthe round Holes _f_ and _g_; and pinned in behind it, to the end that\r\neither Tine of the Harrow may descend at the same time that the other\r\nrises, where the Ground is uneven.\r\n\r\nThe Two wooden Tines K and L are pinned in above the Head, and have\r\neach of them a Shoulder underneath. They stand sloping; so that if\r\nthey take hold of any Clods, they do not drive them before them, but\r\nrise over them. They are of a convenient Length, to give room for\r\nthe Harrow to sink and rise, without raising up the Shares; and to\r\ngive them the more room to move: The Legs of the Harrow are crook’d\r\ndownwards in the Middle.\r\n\r\nThe Distance of these Tines from each other is Twenty-two Inches; so\r\nthat each Tine going Three Inches and an half on the Outside of each\r\nChanel that is next it, fills it up with Earth upon the Seed, from the\r\nOutsides of it; which causes the Rows to come up something nearer the\r\ninner Sides of the Chanels, than to the outer Sides, from whence the\r\nEarth is brought into them by the Tines; and the Two outer Rows by this\r\nmeans come up at Fourteen Inches asunder, tho’ the Chanels were Fifteen\r\nInches asunder.\r\n\r\nThis way of covering adds more Mould to the Top of a Ridge; whereas,\r\nif the Chanels were covered by Tines going within or between them, the\r\nMould would be thrown down from the Top of the Ridge: And these Tines\r\nstand with their Edges and Points inclining outwards, by which means\r\nthey bring in the more Earth to the Chanels.\r\n\r\nIf we find, that the Harrow is too light, we tie a Stone upon it, to\r\nmake it heavier; and sometimes we fix a small Box of Board on the\r\nMiddle of it, to hold Clods of Earth for that Purpose.\r\n\r\nThe fore Funnel C has its upper Edges Two Inches high above the Surface\r\nof the Plank. It is Five Inches Square at Top; its Four opposite Sides\r\nbeing Planes equally inclin’d to each other downwards, until they end\r\nat the Hole in the Bottom of the Funnel, which Hole is continued quite\r\nthro’ the Plank into the Trunk. The Shape of this Hole is shewn in\r\n_Fig._ 9. where the Four Lines _a b_, _b c_, _c d_, and _d a_, each\r\nLine being Three quarters of an Inch, make a true Square, and are\r\nthe upper Edges of the Hole. The Three prick’d Lines _e f_, _f g_,\r\nand _g h_, being each of them longer than the former, tho’ as little\r\nas possible, make the Three lower Edges of the Hole; which being\r\nthus wider below than above, and having all its Sides true Planes\r\nand smooth, it is impossible for the Seed to arch therein. The fore\r\nSide of this Hole is perpendicular to the upper and lower Surfaces of\r\nthe Plank, and, together with the Back of the Sheat, makes one Plane\r\nSurface.\r\n\r\nWhen we drill a large Species of Seed, as Peas or Oats, we can make\r\nthis Hole a full Inch square at Top, and of the same Shape wider at\r\nBottom; which tho’ it be wider than the Trunk, except at its Top, the\r\nSeed will not arch there, because there is room behind, the Plates\r\nbeing broader than the Sides of the Hole; for there can be no Arching\r\nin the Trunk, unless the Seed were confin’d behind as well as on each\r\nSide.\r\n\r\nThe Holes of our Funnels ought to be of the same Shape with this\r\ndescribed; tho’, as I am inform’d, the Pretenders to the making of this\r\nPlough make the Holes of their Funnels the Reverse of this; which being\r\nwrong-way upwards, the Seed is apt to arch in them, except the Holes\r\nare very large.\r\n\r\nOf this Plough, _Fig._ 1. the Two hinder Funnels E and F differ from\r\nthe fore Funnel (which has been described), first, in Dimensions; these\r\nnot being so deep, because they being made in the very Beams, their\r\nupper Edges are in the upper Surface of the Beams, and their Holes at\r\nthe Bottom, being about the Eighth of an Inch deep. The Depth of the\r\nFunnels must want the Eighth of an Inch of the Thickness of the Beams;\r\nbut we make each Funnel an Inch and a quarter broader at Top than its\r\nBeam, by adding a Piece of Wood to each Side of its Beam, which reaches\r\ndown about half-way its Thickness; and these Pieces being firmly fix’d\r\non by Nails, to the Sides of each Beam, the Legs of the Harrow take\r\nhold of these Pieces, which are in the Inside of these Beams. When\r\nthe Plough is taken up to be turn’d, the Man who turns it takes hold\r\nof the Head of the Harrow with one Hand, and lays the other upon the\r\nHopper, or Spindle, to keep it level, and to prevent either of the fore\r\nWheels from striking against the Ground, whilst the Plough is turning\r\nround.\r\n\r\nAnother Difference there is between the Shape of these hinder Funnels\r\nfrom that of the former, to wit, That each fore Side of the hinder\r\nTrunks must not be quite so oblique as the rest; because then the upper\r\nEdge of these fore Sides might be too near the Tenons of the Sheats,\r\nand there might not be sufficient Wood betwixt them, to prevent the\r\nSheats from being torn out; a thing which has never happen’d, that I\r\nknow of. We sometimes make these hinder Funnels of a roundish Shape,\r\nlike a Cone inverted; except that the Part which is next the Sheat, is\r\nnot so oblique as the rest, for the Reason already given.\r\n\r\nThe only Advantage proposed by this roundish Shape is, that there is\r\nless Wood taken out than from the square Corners, and therefore more\r\nWood for the added Pieces to be fastened to the Beams, than, in the\r\nsquare Funnels.\r\n\r\nM and N are Two Pieces of Wood, each Eleven Inches long, Two Inches\r\nbroad, and Two Inches thick: These are screw’d on near each End of the\r\nPlank, by Two Screws and Nuts each: They stand parallel to the other\r\nBeams, and have each a double Standard or Fork, O and P, in them,\r\nperpendicular to the Plank; by which Standards the fore Hopper is drawn\r\nand guided, in the manner as is seen in _Fig._ 21.\r\n\r\nThese Standards ought to be braced (or spurr’d) before and behind, and\r\non their Outsides; they never being press’d inwards, have no occasion\r\nof Braces there: These are to be so placed, that when the Spindle is\r\nin their Forks, it may be exactly over the Hole of the Funnel, so that\r\nthe Seed may drop into the Middle of it, when the Plough stands upon\r\nan horizontal Surface, the Spindle being also exactly parallel to the\r\nfore Edge of the Plank.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 10. is D in the Plough _Fig._ 1. It is Two Feet long, Two Inches\r\nbroad in its narrowest Part, and half an Inch thick in the thinnest\r\nPart, and Two Inches at its Shoulders above the Plank. It is pinn’d\r\nthro’ the Plank before the Funnel, having one of its Legs on each Side\r\nthe Tenon of the Sheat: It stands perpendicular to the Plank: Its only\r\nUse is to hold the fore Hopper from turning upon the Spindle, being put\r\nthro’ a thing (_Fig._ 22.) like the Carrier of a Latch, nail’d onto the\r\nupper Part of the fore Side of the fore Hopper, in which thing this\r\nStandard has room to play, or move side-ways, to the end that either\r\nWheel may rise up.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 11. is one of the hinder Standards, which being placed in the\r\nBeam, as G or H, perpendicular to it, is driven into a Mortise, and\r\npinn’d into the Beam. It has a Shoulder behind, and another before, and\r\na Third on its Outside; which Shoulders serve instead of Braces, to\r\nkeep it from moving backwards, forwards, or outwards: It is Two Feet\r\nFour Inches long, Two Inches broad, and an Inch thick: It is placed\r\nwith its broad or flat Sides towards the Sides of the Beams. It is made\r\nso thin, because it should have the more room for the Hopper to play on\r\nit; and therefore must have its Strength in its Breadth. The Part at\r\n_a_ must stand foremost.\r\n\r\nThe Standards G and H are both alike, except as they are opposite:\r\nTheir Use is to draw, guide, and hold up the hinder Hopper: They are to\r\nbe placed perpendicular to the Beams, and at equal Distance from each\r\nSide of those Beams, and at such a Distance before the Funnels, that\r\nwhen the fore Side of the Hopper by its whole Length bears against the\r\nhinder Surface of the Standards, the Seed may drop into the Middle of\r\nboth Funnels, the Plough standing upon an horizontal Surface.\r\n\r\nBe sure to take care, that the Sheats, Funnels, and Standards, be so\r\nplaced, that the Spindle of the Hopper may be at right Angles with the\r\nBeams.\r\n\r\nQ and R Part of the Limbers, which are also called Shafts, Sharps, and\r\nThills; from whence the Horse that goes in them is call’d a Thiller.\r\nThese Limbers are screw’d down to the Plank, by Two Screws and Nuts\r\neach. The Limbers are kept at their due Distance by the Bar S; near\r\neach End of which Bar, there is a Staple with a Crook underneath each\r\nLimber, to which is hitch’d, or fastened, a Link of each Trace, for\r\ndrawing the Plough. This Bar is parallel to the Plank, and Seven Inches\r\nand an half before its fore Edge.\r\n\r\nThe Limbers must be mounted higher or lower at their fore Ends,\r\naccording to the Height of the Horse that draws in them; and this may\r\nbe done by the Screws that hold them to the Plank, and by cutting away\r\nthe Wood at the Two hinder Screws, or at the Two foremost Screws, or by\r\nWedges.\r\n\r\nEvery Workman knows how to team the Limbers; that is, to place them\r\nso on the Plank, that the Path of the Horse, which goes in the Middle\r\nbetwixt them, may be parallel to all the Shares, and so that a Line,\r\ndrawn in the Middle of this Path, might fall into a strait Line with\r\nthe fore Share, standing on the same even Surface with the Path; for\r\notherwise the Plough will not follow directly after the Horse, but will\r\nincline to one Side.\r\n\r\nThe Use of the Trunks of this Plough is for makeing the Chanels narrow,\r\nof whatsoever Depth they are: But, without Trunks, the Chanels must\r\nbe made wide by Ground-wrists, which spread the Sides of the Chanels\r\nwide asunder, to the end that they may lie open for receiving of the\r\nSeed; and the deeper they are, the wider they must be: By this Width\r\nof a Chanel, the Seed in it is with more Difficulty cover’d, and the\r\nChanel fill’d with the largest Clods, and the Seed comes up of a great\r\nBreadth, perhaps Three or Four Inches wide, so that the Weeds coming\r\ntherein are hard to be gotten out.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these Inconveniences of wide Chanels, I contrived Trunks like\r\nthose described, except that they were but Five or Six Inches high; and\r\nthe Tops of their Plates, bending outwards from each other, form’d Two\r\nSides of a Funnel; and the Wood between the Two Plates, being cut bevel\r\nat the Top, was as the fore Side of a Funnel to this Trunk: It was open\r\nbehind from Top to Bottom: The Wheels were low, and the Seed-boxes\r\nnarrow: The Seed in these Chanels was easily cover’d, especially those\r\nSorts which were sown in dry Weather; for then the finest Mould would\r\nrun in, and cover the Seed, as soon as the Trunks were past it.\r\n\r\nThe Seed in such a narrow Chanel comes up in a Line, where the Row not\r\nbeing above a Quarter of an Inch broad, scarce any Weeds come in it;\r\nand when the Weather is dry, the Earth of the Chanel not lying open to\r\nbe dry’d, the Seed comes up the sooner.\r\n\r\nI had Two Reasons for making of these Trunks higher, as they are now\r\nused: The one was, to avoid the too great Length of the Shares; and my\r\nother Reason was, that with those low Trunks, and long Shares, there\r\ncould not be Two Ranks of Shares, and their Hoppers in the Plough,\r\nwhich are necessary for making very narrow Partitions, and absolutely\r\nnecessary for planting this treble Row of Wheat; for if Three Shares\r\nfor making the Seven-inch Partitions were placed in one Rank, the Mould\r\n(which is always moist or wet, when we plant Wheat) would be driven\r\nbefore the Shares, there not being room for it to pass betwixt them.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12. is one End of the hinder Hopper laid open. I call it one\r\nEnd (altho’ it be an intire Box by itself) because this Hopper is\r\nsupposed to have its middle Part cut out, to have a clearer Sight of\r\nthe Plough, and fore Hopper; as is seen in _Fig._ 15. which is the\r\nwhole Hopper in Two Parts. In this _Fig._ 12, A is the Inside of one\r\nEnd of the Hopper, made with several Pieces of half-inch Elm-board\r\nnail’d on to the Post _c a_, on the fore Side; which Post is a little\r\nmore than half an Inch square, and Seventeen Inches and Three quarters\r\nlong, being the Depth of that Part of the Hopper which holds the Seed.\r\nB is the fore Side of this Hopper; which must be nail’d on to the said\r\nPod, being of the same Length with it, and Four Inches broad, and half\r\nan Inch thick; and this is the Part which on its Outside goes against\r\nthe right-hand Standard of the Plough, when it is at Work. The other\r\nPost _b d_, of the same Thickness with the former, is nail’d in within\r\nhalf an Inch of the opposite Edge of this End; to which Post also C\r\nbeing nail’d, makes the hinder Side of this Part of the Hopper. C is\r\nFour Inches broad, and half an Inch thick; and both it, and the Post\r\nto which it is to be nail’d, are something longer than its opposite\r\nSide, because the Side B makes right Angles with the Top and Bottom of\r\nthe Hopper; but the hinder Side C makes oblique Angles with the Top\r\nand Bottom of the Hopper; and the Reason of this is, because when the\r\nHopper is full of Seed, it may be equally pois’d on the Spindle; which\r\nit could not be without this Bevel, unless the Bottom of the Hopper did\r\ncome as much behind the Spindle as before it; and that would hinder\r\nthe Person that follows the Drill, from seeing the Seed fall out of\r\nthe Seed-box into the Funnel; and that Part of the Bottom which is\r\nbefore the Spindle cannot be made shorter, because that Part of the\r\nSeed-box which is before the Spindle, is (upon account of its Tongue)\r\nmuch longer than the Part of it which is behind the Spindle. ’Tis true\r\nthat when the Hopper is empty of Seed, it cannot be thus pois’d; but\r\nthen, being so light, it does not require it. _e f g h_ is a Piece\r\nof a Board, nail’d on to that Part of the End A, which is below the\r\nBottom of the Cavity which holds the Seed, and is commonly plac’d a\r\nlittle cross the Grain of the Board to which it is nail’d, and serves\r\nto strengthen it, and keeps the Hole _i_ from splitting. The upper Edge\r\n_e f_ of this added Piece of Board is exactly the Length of the Bottom\r\nof the Hopper, whereto the Brass Seed-box is fastened; and this Bottom,\r\ntogether with its Seed-box under it, being put into its Place, bears\r\nupon this Piece from _e_ to _f_, which holds Up the right Side of the\r\nBottom, and keeps it from sinking downwards; as the lower Ends of the\r\nTwo mention’d Posts, and the fore and hinder Side B and C nail’d to\r\nthem, prevent its rising upwards.\r\n\r\nThe Manner of making the Hole _i_ is as follows: Place the Seed-box\r\nwith its fore End at _e_, and hinder End at _f_, with the Base of its\r\nCylinder (or great Hole) against this added Piece of Board, and its\r\nupper Edge exactly the Height of the Edge _e f_; then, with a Pair of\r\nCompasses put thro’ the Cylinder of the Seed-box, mark round the inner\r\nEdge of its Base upon the added Board; then take off the Seed-box, and\r\nfind the Centre of the mark’d Circle; and then with a Tool call’d a\r\nCentre-bit, of the right Size, bore the Hole quite thro’ the double\r\nBoard; and this Hole will be in the right Place, and of the same\r\nDiameter with the Spindle; but in case there is to be a Brass Wreath\r\non that Part of the Spindle which is to turn in this Hole, then the\r\nHole must be bor’d of the same Diameter with that Part of the Wreath\r\nwhich is to enter it; and that may be perhaps near a quarter of an Inch\r\nlonger than the Diameter of the Spindle, upon which it is fastened.\r\n\r\nThis End A, thus bor’d and shap’d, is a Pattern for its Opposite, and\r\nfor the other Two Opposites of the other Cavity, which holds the Seed\r\nat the other End of the Hopper.\r\n\r\nWhen the Opposite of A (with the Two Posts whereto the fore Side B, and\r\nthe hinder Side C, are nail’d, and having a like Piece of Board in its\r\nlower Part with a like Hole in it) is added, and when the Bottom (Four\r\nInches broad), with its Seed-box under it, is thrust in at f by the\r\nprick’d Lines, until it reach _e_, bearing on one Side upon the Piece\r\nof Board _e f g h_, and the other Edge of the Bottom bearing in like\r\nmanner upon the opposite Piece, then this Cavity of the Hopper, which\r\nwill contain about Two Gallons of Seeds, will be finish’d.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The Bottom must make a right Angle with the Two fore Posts,\r\nhaving the Side B perpendicular to it.\r\n\r\nD is a Part of the Board which comes out farther than the Hopper, in\r\norder to hold a Bar at _k_; which being fastened there, and in like\r\nmanner to the Opposite of this Board, this Bar bearing against the fore\r\nPart of the Standard, the Hopper and its Wheels are in part drawn by it.\r\n\r\nInto the Notch _l_ is fastened one End of a long Bar, which passes\r\nthe whole Length of the Hopper, and holds the upper Part of its Two\r\nCavities in their Places, as is seen mark’d D, in _Fig._ 15.\r\n\r\nE is Part of the Board which comes before the Hopper, and whereto one\r\nEnd of a Piece of Wood is fastened by Nails or Screws, which bearing\r\nagainst the fore Part of the Standard, and against its Inside, the\r\nHopper is in part drawn and guided by it, as shall be shewn in _Fig._\r\n15.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 13. shews the Outside of the Figure last describ’d. A is the\r\nStandard by which this End of the Hopper is drawn, in the manner as it\r\nis here placed. B is one End of the Spindle passing thro’ the Hopper\r\nand Seed-box. C the Bottom, having the Seed-box fastened on to it, with\r\none Screw before, and another behind, with their Nuts underneath, and\r\nthe Heads of their Screws very thin, and the Pins square at Top, that\r\nthey may not turn in the Wood; and their Heads must either be let into\r\nthe Wood, even with the Surface, or else the Sides B C of the Hopper\r\nmust be cut for these Heads of the Screws to pass in under them.\r\n\r\nThis bottom Board, which holds the brass Seed-box, is Four Inches\r\nbroad, and full half an Inch thick, and at each End a quarter of an\r\nInch longer than the Seed-box: This Piece is first thrust in sliding\r\nupon the Two added Pieces of Board, until its fore End comes under the\r\nfore Side of the Hopper, and its hinder End under the hinder Side;\r\nthen setting the Hopper with its Bottom upwards, the Spindle being\r\nthro’ the Seed-box, and Holes of the Hopper, we hold the Seed-box\r\nhard upon the Bottom, at equal Distance from each End of it, whilst\r\nthe Holes are bored thro’ the Bottom, by the Holes at each End of the\r\nSeed-box; and then the Screws, being put thro’, screw on the Box; and\r\nwhen that is done, we make a Mark upon the bottom Board, with the\r\nCompasses, on each Side of the Brass Box, beginning from the Ends of\r\nthe Axis of the Tongue, reaching as far backwards as is the Length of\r\nthe Mortise: These Two Lines or Marks are a Direction for cutting the\r\nHole in the Bottom of the Hopper, thro’ which the Seed descends into\r\nthe Seed-box; then we pull out the Spindle, then draw out the Bottom,\r\ntake off the Seed-box, and cut the Hole in the Bottom in the manner I\r\nwill now describe in _Fig._ 14. where the Two pricked Lines _a b_ and\r\n_c d_ are the lower Edges of the Hole, and the same with the Two Lines\r\nmentioned to be marked by the Sides of the Seed-box. The pricked Line\r\n_a d_, being at right Angles with the Two former, is the lower Edge of\r\nthe fore End of the Hole, and exactly over the Axis of the Tongue, and\r\nparallel to it. The pricked Line _b c_ is the lower Edge of the hinder\r\nEnd of the Hole, which is just over the hinder End of the Mortise, and\r\nparallel and equal to the last-mentioned pricked Line: These Four\r\npricked Lines are the lower Edges of this Hole, contiguous to the\r\nSeed-box. The Two Lines _e f_ and _g h_ are the upper Edges of the\r\nSides of the Hole, which, being farther asunder than the lower Edges,\r\nmake the reverse Bevel of this Hole; which may be determined by this,\r\nthat the Surface between these Two upper and lower Edges, being Planes,\r\nare inclined to one another downwards, in an Angle of about One hundred\r\nand Thirty Degrees. The Two Lines _e g_ and _f h_, at right Angles\r\nwith the Two last-mentioned Lines, make the upper Edges of the Ends of\r\nthis Hole; and, being nearer together, than the pricked Lines under\r\nthem, the plane Surfaces, betwixt these Two Lines and those Two pricked\r\nLines, shew the Bevel of the Ends of these, which are inclined to each\r\nother upwards in an Angle of about Sixty-five Degrees.\r\n\r\nThis double Bevel effectually prevents the Seed from arching in the\r\nHole, before it gets into the Mortise of the Seed-box; and also, the\r\nTwo upper Edges of the Ends of the Hole being nearer together than the\r\nlower, there is the more Wood left between these Edges and the Screws,\r\nwhich hold the Box to the Bottom, whereby the Board is less apt to\r\nsplit.\r\n\r\nThen the Box being screwed on to the Bottom, and thrust again into its\r\nPlace, the Spindle, passing thro’ both the Hopper and the Box, keeps\r\nthe Bottom in its Place: Then D, in _Fig._ 13. is the imaginary Plane\r\nof the Top or Mouth of the Hopper, being a rectangled Parallelogram,\r\nand parallel to the Bottom, to which the fore End is perpendicular, and\r\na rectangled Parallelogram of the same Breadth.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 15. shews the fore Side of the whole hinder Hopper, with its\r\nTwo Cavities, and all its Accoutrements, except the Wheels; the Two\r\nEnds A and B being exactly alike, having each of them its Seed-box at\r\nthe Bottom, in the same manner as in the one has been described. The\r\nBar D holds together the upper Parts of this double Hopper at a right\r\nDistance, which is, when there is Ten Inches clear room betwixt the\r\nTwo single ones. The Spindle E, passing thro’ the Whole, holds the Two\r\nsingle Hoppers by Four Wreaths, at the same Distance below, as they are\r\nheld by the Bar above.\r\n\r\nThese Four Wreaths are screwed on to the Spindle, to keep it from\r\nmoving towards either End, as well as to hold the Hoppers in their\r\nPlaces: Two of which Wreaths are seen at _a_ and _b_; and the other Two\r\nare placed on the Outsides, as these Two are on the Insides. Before\r\nwe proceed any farther in this Figure, it will be proper to shew the\r\nWreaths, which are of Two Sorts.\r\n\r\nThe one in _Fig._ 16. where A is its Hollow, which is circular, and\r\nmust be of the same Diameter with the Spindle; and, being thrust on\r\nupon the Spindle, till it touch the Board, is fastened to the Spindle\r\nby a small Screw thro’ each of its opposite Holes, _a b_ shews the\r\nBreadth of this Wreath, whether it be made of Brass or Wood: It is\r\nlittle more than half an Inch. _b c d_ is the Part of it that goes\r\nagainst the Board: The Thickness of the Surface of this End which goes\r\nagainst the Board, is a quarter of an Inch, if made with Brass; but if\r\nwith Wood, half an Inch; but the Thickness of its other End _a e f_\r\nis less than its End _b c d_, by which means the Screws are the more\r\neasily turned in.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 17. shews the other Sort of Wreath, which is always made in\r\nBrass: Its Cavity is a hollow Cylinder like the former: When it is on\r\nthe Spindle, its End _a b c_ is thrust into the Hole of the Board (made\r\nwider for the Purpose) until _d e f_ come close to the Board, and stop\r\nit from entering any farther; then we screw it on to the Spindle by the\r\nHoles, as the other Sort of Wreath is described to be screwed.\r\n\r\nThis is the best Sort of Wreath; because it keeps the Spindle from\r\nwearing against the Edges of the Hole, and then the Spindle never has\r\nany Friction against the Wood in any Part of it; but the other Sort\r\nare more easily made (especially of Wood), and the Spindle will last a\r\ngreat while in them; or if it be worn out, the Expence of Three-pence\r\nor Four-pence will purchase a new Spindle.\r\n\r\nNow I must return to _Fig._ 15. where the Spindle E having its Four\r\nWreaths fixt on it, we turn it round with our Hand, to see whether the\r\nWreaths are put on true; and when they are so, neither the Spindle,\r\nnor the Hoppers, can move end-ways: Tho’ the Spindle be pretty hard to\r\nturn round, the Wheels will soon cause it to turn easily. Whilst the\r\nSpindle is in this Posture, we turn the Hopper Bottom upwards, and mark\r\nthe Spindle for cutting the Notches in the manner before directed; and\r\nthen we take off the Spindle, and cut the Notches, and also cut each\r\nEnd of the Spindle square, up to a Shoulder at each End, so that the\r\nWheels may come easily on without knocking or thrusting; and then we\r\nreturn the Spindle to its Place, and put on the Wheels, pinning them\r\non with each a long Nail, which being crooked at the Ends, prevent it\r\nfrom falling out, but may be very easily pulled out with the Claws of\r\na Hammer; but we must take care, that neither the square Ends of the\r\nSpindle, nor the square Holes in the Naves (or Hubs) of the Wheels\r\n(into which they enter), be taper; for, if they are taper, the Wheels\r\nwill be apt to work themselves off.\r\n\r\nThe Piece of Wood, _Fig._ 18. is that which goes over the Standard,\r\nand, being placed in the Hopper, as F. in _Fig._ 15. draws that Part\r\nof the Hopper by its Inside _a b_ bearing against the fore Part of the\r\nStandard; and that Part of it from _b_ to _c_, being the Breadth of the\r\nStandard, bears against its inner Inside, to prevent the Hopper from\r\ngoing any farther towards that End. This Piece of Wood is fastened to\r\nthe Boards of the Hopper, either by Screws or Nails: This Piece, from\r\n_d_ to _e_, must be of such a Thickness, that the Standard, bearing\r\nagainst its Inside _b c_, may be equidistant from each Board, to which\r\nthis Piece is fastened. The Part, or fore Side of this Piece _f g_,\r\nmust be the Length of the Distance between Board and Board, to which it\r\nis fastened; and that is exactly Four Inches. Its Thickness and Depth\r\nmust be such as may make it strong enough for the Purposes intended.\r\n\r\nThe Piece marked _Fig._ 19. is the Opposite of the former, and to be\r\nplaced in the same manner, and as it is seen marked G in _Fig._ 15.\r\nobserving always, that the Part of it, which holds the Hopper from\r\nmoving end-ways, must always be on the Inside of the Standard; for, if\r\nthese Pieces should bear against the Outsides of the Standards, the\r\nHopper could have no Play upon them, nor could either of the Wheels\r\nrise up without raising the Share (that was next to it) out of the\r\nGround; but, being thus placed, either Wheel may rise without the\r\nother, and without raising the Share.\r\n\r\nI say more of this, because it is a Point wherein young Workmen are apt\r\nto mistake.\r\n\r\nThus having shewn, in _Fig._ 15. how the Hopper is guided and drawn at\r\nthe lower Part, I come next to shew how it is held and drawn at its\r\nupper Part; for which the Piece of Wood, _Fig._ 20. being a competent\r\nBreadth and Thickness, Four Inches long, is fixt in between the Boards\r\nwith Nails or Screws; and is H in _Fig._ 15. The Standard passing up\r\nbetwixt this and the fore Side of the Hopper, its fore Surface bearing\r\nagainst this Bar, and its hinder Surface against the Hopper; so that\r\nthe Hopper may rise and sink easily upon the Standard at Top, being\r\nin the Middle on the fore Side of the Hopper; there will be an equal\r\nDistance of each Side, for either Wheel to rise, without the Standard\r\nstriking against the Sides of the Hopper to hinder its rising. There\r\nis another Bar equal to this, and has the same Office, at the other\r\nEnd of the Hopper, marked I. Likewise the Bar D is of the same Use with\r\nthese mentioned short Bars, and they help to strengthen one another.\r\n\r\nWhen the Wheels are put on till they reach near to the Wreaths, they\r\nwill stand with their Rings, or Circles, Two Feet Three Inches asunder.\r\n\r\nWe set them as near together as conveniently we can; because when they\r\nare too wide, they are apt to draw the Plough towards one Side of the\r\nRidge; and sometimes, when the Ridge is high, the Hopper might bear\r\nupon the Funnels; and then the Wheels, being carried above the Ground,\r\nwould not turn to bring out the Seed: And that these Wheels may come\r\nthe nearer together, their Spokes are set almost perpendicular; so\r\nthat the Wheels are not concave, as other Wheels are. This Hopper is\r\nshewn, put on upon its Standards, in its Place, in _Fig._ 21. where the\r\nmentioned Bar D, which holds the Hopper together at Top, is seen, as\r\nalso the Four Wreaths, and likewise the hinder End of the Seed-boxes\r\nstanding over the Funnels, with their Trunks underneath them. Here also\r\nthe back Part of the fore Hopper is seen, with its Seed-box standing\r\nover the fore Funnel: Its Mouth also is seen at A; as also the Top of\r\nits fore Side held up by the thing (_Fig._ 22.) like the Carrier of a\r\nLatch, with the Nails in it, which fasten it to the Top of the fore\r\nSide of the Hopper, and give room for either of its Wheels to rise.\r\n\r\nThis fore Hopper may easily be described by the Figure of a Box, like\r\nthe other already described, at its Ends, which are of the same Shape\r\nwith the Inside of the Box, _Fig._ 12. but much lower, being Seven\r\nInches and an half deep, and Sixteen Inches long; and the Breadth of\r\nits Bottom is determined by the Length of the Seed-box, and a little\r\nwider at Top, on account of the Bevel which poises it: It carries no\r\nmore Seed than one End of the hinder Hopper; but it is capable of\r\nholding more; but we do not fill it quite, lest some of the Seed should\r\nfly over in jolting, its Mouth being so much longer than the other.\r\n\r\nThis Hopper is kept in its Place, from moving end-ways upon the\r\nSpindle, by a Wreath fixed to the Spindle at each End of the Box, in\r\nthe same manner as has been described for holding the other Hopper. The\r\nWreaths most proper for this Purpose are the Sort described in _Fig._\r\n17. but the other Sort described in _Fig._ 16. and even made with Wood,\r\nwill suffice; but then we must take care to make the Hole at the End\r\nof the Hopper of a considerable Thickness, that it may not wear the\r\nSpindle, which, by reason of its great Length, is the more liable to\r\nbend, and be cut by the Edges of the Holes; which Cutting cannot be\r\nprevented but by the Thickness of the Holes, or by such Wreaths as that\r\nof _Fig._ 17.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes make this Hopper exactly like a common Box, without any\r\nPart of its Ends descending below the Bottom; and, in that Case, we\r\nplace a narrower Piece of Board at each End of the Hopper, like that of\r\n_Fig._ 23. in which Figure, the Hole A being put on upon the Spindle,\r\nthe Piece of Board is fastened on by a Screw and Nut thro’ the Hole\r\nB, near the Top of the End of the Hopper, and by another Screw and\r\nNut thro’ the Hole C, near the Bottom of the Hopper. Another such a\r\nPiece of Board, fixed on in the same manner to the opposite End of the\r\nHopper, holds this long Hopper parallel to its Spindle, that passes\r\nthro’ the Holes of these Two Pieces, and thro’ the Brass Seed-box,\r\nwhich is fixed up to the Bottom, in the Middle betwixt them.\r\n\r\nThere are Two Methods for letting the Seed pass from a long Hopper into\r\nthe Seed-box. The first is that of cutting the Hole through its Bottom,\r\nin the manner that has been shewn in _Fig._ 14. The other is that which\r\ncannot be used in a Hopper so short as the Boxes of our hinder Hoppers\r\nare; but in the fore Hopper, or any other long Hopper, we can place the\r\nBrass Seed-box to a Bottom made for the Purpose, like that in _Fig._\r\n24. where there is a Piece of Board on the fore Part of the Hopper from\r\nEnd to End, as _a b_, and another on the hinder Part of the Hopper, as\r\n_c d_. Then the fore Part of the Brass Seed-box, being placed under the\r\nPiece _a b_, is screwed up to it at _e_, and the hinder Part of the\r\nSeed-box under _c d_ screwed up to it at _f_; then the Bottom of the\r\nHopper, being open in the Middle, is shut by very thin Boards, _g_ and\r\n_h_, fixed up to the mentioned Pieces: These Boards having their upper\r\nSurface even with the upper Edges of the Brass Box, the Seed can no way\r\narch in coming into the Mortise of the Seed-box. Whichever of these Two\r\nMethods be made use of, in a long Hopper, the Bottom must be fixed to\r\nthe Two Sides, by small Bars of Wood of about Three quarters of an Inch\r\nsquare, to which the Bottom and Sides are fastened by Nails, in the\r\nmanner that the Ends and Sides of the hinder Hoppers are fastened to\r\ntheir Posts, which stand in their Corners.\r\n\r\nWe take the same Method for cutting the Notches in this Spindle, as has\r\nbeen described for cutting the Notches in the other Spindle.\r\n\r\nBut observe, That the great Length of this Spindle requires it to be\r\nthe larger; and we make it of an Inch and Three quarters Diameter, the\r\nother being only an Inch and an half: We therefore bore the great Hole\r\nor Cylinder of its Brass Seed-box a quarter of an Inch in Diameter\r\nlarger than of the Brass Seed-boxes of the hinder Hoppers; and we\r\ncommonly make a Notch more in the Circumference of this Spindle,\r\nbecause the Semidiameters of its Wheels must be as much greater than of\r\nthe hinder Wheels, as is the Thickness of the Plank, and the Ends of\r\nthe Limbers which are betwixt this Spindle and the upper Surface of the\r\nTwo Beams.\r\n\r\nWe make all our Spindles of clear-quarter’d Ash, without Knots or\r\nCrooks; and when they are well dry’d, and made perfectly round, and of\r\nequal Diameter from one End to the other, by the Prong-maker, we pay a\r\nPeny _per_ Foot for them at the first Hand, and they will now-and-then\r\nhave something more for the largest Size; but we are only curious to\r\nhave the middle Part of this long Spindle exact; for we graft on a\r\nPiece at each End, which does not require any Exactness: The Graftings\r\nare seen at _a a_ at one End, and _b b_ at the other End of the Spindle\r\n(in this _Fig._ 21.) by Four flattish Iron Rings driven on upon the\r\ngrafted Parts, as they appear under those Letters in the Middle.\r\nBetween each Pair of these Rings, we drive a small Iron Pin thro’ the\r\nJoints at _c_ and at _d_, to keep the Grafts from separating end-ways;\r\nand if they are not tight enough, we make them so, by Wedges driven in\r\nbetwixt them and the Spindle.\r\n\r\nThis fore Hopper is drawn by the Spindle, and the Spindle is drawn by\r\nthe Two double Standards B and C, betwixt whose Forks it is placed,\r\nas appears in this Figure; the Distance between each Fork, or double\r\nStandard, being exactly the Diameter of the Spindle, so that the\r\nSpindle may have just room to rise and sink there, and no more.\r\n\r\nThe Hopper and Spindle are guided, or kept in their Place, from moving\r\nend-ways, by Two Wreaths screw’d on to the Spindle, the one at _e_, and\r\nthe other at _f_; each of which Wreaths, bearing against the Surfaces\r\nof both the Legs of each double Standard, on the Sides next to the\r\nHopper, prevent the Spindle and Hopper from moving towards either End;\r\nand yet admit the Wheels, or either of them, to rise and sink without\r\nraising either Side of the Plough, contrary to what would happen, if\r\nthe Wreaths were placed on the Outsides of the Standards next to the\r\nWheels.\r\n\r\nWe make these Wreaths a little different from the other Sort of\r\nWreaths, which turn against the Holes; we make them of a greater\r\nDiameter, lest they should at any time get in betwixt the Legs of the\r\ndouble Standards, in case the Standards should be loose, or bend:\r\nTherefore we make the Diameter of each of these Wreaths, at least,\r\nTwo Inches and Three quarters: We always make them of Wood, and of a\r\npeculiar Shape, taking off their Edges next the Standards, which Edges\r\nwould be an Impediment to the Rising of one End of the Spindle without\r\nthe other. So that, for making these Wreaths, we may form a Piece of\r\nWood of the Shape of a Skittle-bowl (or an oblate Spheroid) having an\r\nInch and Three-quarter Hole bor’d thro’ its Middle, and then cut by its\r\nDiameter (which is about Three Inches) in Two Halves, each of which\r\nwill be one of these Wreaths; and they must be placed on the Spindle,\r\nwith their convex Sides bearing against their respective Standards.\r\n\r\nThe Diameter of the fore Wheels is about Thirty Inches, as the Diameter\r\nof the hinder Wheels is about Twenty-two.\r\n\r\nThe fore Spindle should be of such a Length, that its square Ends, E\r\nand F, may come out Three or Four Inches farther than the Hubs (or\r\nStocks) of the Wheels; so that there may be room to shift the Wheels\r\ntowards either End, for making several Sets of Notches, for the Use of\r\nthe Seed-box.\r\n\r\nObserve, Tho’ the fore Hopper is drawn by its Spindle, yet the hinder\r\nSpindle is drawn by its Hopper.\r\n\r\nThe Reason of this great Distance between the Two fore Wheels is not\r\nso much for their serving as Marking Wheels to this particular Drill;\r\nwhich being drawn only upon a Ridge, its Top is a sufficient Direction\r\nfor leading the Horse to keep the Rows parallel to one another, if the\r\nRidges are so; but if the Wheels were much nearer together than they\r\nare, and yet more than Six Feet asunder, the Wheels going on the Sides\r\nof the next Ridges would be apt to turn the Drill out of the Horse-path\r\ntowards one Side, not permitting the Drill to follow directly after the\r\nHorse; and if the Wheels should stand at Six or Seven Feet Distance\r\nfrom one another, then they must go in the Furrows which are on each\r\nSide of the Six-feet Ridge: This would occasion their Hopper to bear\r\nupon the Plank, which would carry the Wheels above the Ground, and no\r\nSeed would be turned out of the Hopper, unless the Wheels were of an\r\nextraordinary Height[268]; and the Height requir’d for them would be\r\nvery uncertain, some Furrows being much deeper than others; but the\r\nTops of contiguous Ridges are generally of an equal Height, whether the\r\nFurrows betwixt them be deep or shallow; for we seldom make Ridges of\r\nan unequal Height in the same Field: Therefore there can be no need to\r\nchange the Height of our Wheels, that are to go upon the Middle of the\r\nRidges; but if they went in the Furrows they must be of a different\r\nHeight when used for drilling of high Ridges, from what would be\r\nrequired when used for drilling low Ridges.\r\n\r\n  [268] Notwithstanding the Reasons given, and that I have never used\r\n  Wheels of such an Height as might be necessary for going in the\r\n  Furrows, yet it may not be amiss to try such; because with them the\r\n  Spindle needeth not to be more than half the Length of one that is\r\n  carried by low Wheels: And high Wheels will allow the Funnel to be\r\n  much larger, so that altho’ the Spindle go higher from it, no Seed\r\n  will drop beside a large Funnel; but there is not room for a large\r\n  one under low Wheels.\r\n\r\n  I did not think it necessary to describe the Manner of making\r\n  Drill-wheels any otherways than by shewing them in the _Plates_;\r\n  but I will observe here, that they are to be made very light: One\r\n  of mine, that is 30 Inches high, weighs Five Pounds and an half; it\r\n  has a Circle or Ring of Iron, whose Depth is half an Inch, and its\r\n  Thickness a quarter of an Inch; also very thin Iron Stock-bands to\r\n  hold the Nave or Stock from splitting. The Circle is held on the\r\n  Spokes by small flat Iron Pins on each Side; and each Spoke has a\r\n  Ring of Iron to secure its End from being split by driving in of the\r\n  Pins. We also make the Drill-wheels less concave than other Wheels\r\n  are.\r\n\r\nOne Reason why the hinder Shares are shorter than the fore Share (and\r\nconsequently the fore Part of their Sheats less oblique) is, that they\r\nmay be set the nearer to the Plank; and I have had a Drill with Five\r\nShares in the Plank, Fourteen Inches asunder, and Four of these hinder\r\nSheats following in another Rank, whose Shares were less than Three\r\nInches long; so that their Beams were set so far forwards, that one\r\nHopper (by a Contrivance that carried the Seed forwards to the fore\r\nRank, and backwards to the other Rank) supply’d the Seed to both Ranks\r\nof Trunks, and planted St. Foin in Rows Seven Inches asunder, when the\r\nGround was too rough to be planted with Rows at that Distance by one\r\nRank of Shares.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected, that the fore Part of these hinder Sheats might\r\nnot be oblique enough to raise up the Strings of Roots or Stubble,\r\nwhich might come across them in their Way; but this Inconvenience is\r\nremedied by the greater Obliquity of the fore Sheat (or Sheats), which\r\nclears the Way for the hinder Sheats, by raising out of the Ground such\r\nStrings, _&c._ which might annoy them; especially, in this Wheat-drill,\r\nwhere the fore Share so clears the way of the hinder Shares, that they\r\ncan take hold of no String in the Ground, except of the Ends of such\r\nwhich the fore Share has loosen’d; and they hanging faster in the\r\nGround by their other Ends, the hinder Shares slip by them without\r\ntaking hold of them; and the Harrow-tines, going after so near to\r\nthe Chanels of the hinder Sheats, by the same means escape also from\r\nhanging in such Strings.\r\n\r\nThe Reasons for placing the One Share and One Hopper before, and the\r\nTwo behind, in this Wheat-drill, are so many, and so obvious, that it\r\nwould be but losing of Time to mention them.\r\n\r\nThe Limbers G and H, we make of Aspen, Poplar, or Willow, for\r\nLightness; we make them as small and light as we can, allowing them\r\nconvenient Strength; and the shorter they are, the more exactly the\r\nDrill will follow the Horse, without the Hand of him, that follows the\r\nDrill, whose chief Business is, with the Paddle to keep all the Shares\r\nand Tines from being clogged up by the Dirt sticking to them, and also\r\nto observe whether the Seed be delivered equally and justly to all the\r\nChanels.\r\n\r\nThese Limbers should approach so near together at their fore Parts,\r\nnear the Chain, that there may be none or very little room betwixt the\r\nLimbers and the Horse; and therefore must be nearer together for a very\r\nlittle Horse than for a great one: The Horse, which I have used in all\r\nmy Drills for these many Years past, is a little one, about Thirteen\r\nHands high; and the fore Part of my Drill-limbers are Twenty Inches\r\nwide asunder at the Chain.\r\n\r\nAt _g_ on the Outside of the Limber G, is a small Staple driven in,\r\nhaving one Link on it, which holds a small Hook, which, taking hold of\r\ndifferent Links of the very small Chain I, raises or sinks the fore\r\nPart of the Plough to different Heights. But take care to set it at\r\nsuch a Degree, that the fore and hinder Share may go equally deep in\r\nthe Ground; and when they do so, the fore Part of the Limbers ought to\r\nbe higher than the Traces which draw them.\r\n\r\nAt _h_ in the Limber H, is driven another Staple, which holds the\r\nother End of the Chain; or else, instead of a Chain, we may make use\r\nof a Piece of Cord, one End of which put thro’ this Staple, and ty’d\r\nto the Limber, and a Piece of Chain of half a dozen Links, fasten’d to\r\nthe other End of such a Cord, will serve as well as a whole Chain, for\r\nraising and sinking the Limbers.\r\n\r\nHe who can by these Directions make this Wheat-drill, may very easily\r\nmake any other Sort of Drill, for planting any Sort of Corn, or other\r\nSeeds that are near about the Bigness of Seeds of Corn: He may make it\r\nwith a single Row of Sheats, by placing as many of these fore Sheats as\r\nhe pleases in the Plank, which maybe longer or shorter, as he thinks\r\nfit; and he may add a Beam betwixt every Two of them, with a Sheat in\r\nit, like these hinder Sheats; and then the Drill will be double, having\r\nTwo Ranks of Shares. But I must advise him never to make a Drill with\r\nmore Shares than will be contain’d in Four Feet Breadth, that is, from\r\nthe outermost on the right Hand, to the outermost on the left Hand; for\r\nshould the Drill be broader, some of the Shares might pass over hollow\r\nPlaces of the Ground without reaching them, and then the Seed falling\r\non the Ground would be uncover’d in such low Places.\r\n\r\nTo a Drill that plants upon the Level, Marking-wheels are necessary,\r\nto the End that every Row may be at its due Distance: As in a Drill\r\nwith Five Shares, for planting Rows Eight Inches asunder, Four of the\r\nFive cannot err, because Four equal Spaces are included betwixt the\r\nFive Shares; but the Fifth (which we call the parting Space) being on\r\nthe Outside unconfin’d, would scarce ever be equal, were it not kept\r\nequal by the Help of the Marking-wheels. The Rule for setting of these\r\nis thus: We compute altogether the Five Spaces belonging to the Five\r\nRows; which being in all Forty Inches, we set the Marking-wheels Eighty\r\nInches asunder, that is, double the Distance of all the Spaces, each\r\nWheel being equidistant to the Middle of the Drill, which Middle being\r\nexactly over the Horse-path, when the Drill is turn’d, the Horse goes\r\nback upon the Track of one of these Wheels, making his Path exactly\r\nForty Inches distant from his last Path: By this means also the Rows of\r\nthe whole Field may be kept equidistant, and parallel to one another;\r\nso that it would be difficult for an Eye to distinguish the parting\r\nRows from the rest.\r\n\r\nBut when Two different Sorts of Seed are planted, suppose a Row of St.\r\nFoin betwixt every Row of Barley, the Rows of which being Eight Inches\r\nasunder, and the Barley drill’d by the fore Hopper into the Chanels\r\nmade by the five Shares, and the St. Foin drill’d from the hinder\r\nHopper into the Chanels made by Six Shares, the Marking-wheels must be\r\nat no greater Distance than those above-mention’d, where there are only\r\nFive Shares; because one of the Six, which are for the St. Foin, must\r\nalways return in the same Chanel, going twice therein; for One Row of\r\nBarley would be missing, in case the parting Space should be made by\r\nthis Sixth Share; and that parting Space would have no Barley in it.\r\nTherefore it is a Rule, that whensoever Two Sorts of Seeds are drill’d,\r\nthe Rows of one Sort betwixt the Rows of the other there must be an odd\r\nShare in the Drill, which must go twice in one Chanel, and the Distance\r\nof the Marking-wheels must be accounted from that Rank of Shares which\r\nare the fewest: It must also be contriv’d in this Case, that each\r\noutermost Seed-box must deliver but half the Quantity of Seed that each\r\nof the inner Seed-boxes do; because the outer ones going twice in a\r\nPlace, their Chanels would otherwise have a Quantity of Seed double to\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIn a Drill that has Two Spindles, we place the Marking-wheels on the\r\nforemost, which upon their Account is the longest; but if we should\r\nuse the Wheels of the hinder Spindle as Marking-wheels, then that must\r\nbe the longest, and so the fore Wheels (their Semidiameters being much\r\nlonger than the Semidiameters of the hinder Wheels, and their Spindles\r\nshorter) would strike against the hinder Spindle, unless it were set\r\nfarther back than is convenient.\r\n\r\nWhen Ground is harrow’d the last time before it is to be drill’d, we\r\ncontrive that the Harrows may not go directly towards the same Point\r\nthat the Drill is to go, lest the Track of the Marking-wheel should be\r\nexactly parallel with the Track of the Harrow-tines, which might make\r\nit difficult to distinguish the Track of the Wheel from that of the\r\nHarrow-tine.\r\n\r\nHe that has not a great Quantity of Ground to plant with St. Foin, and\r\ndoes not plant it betwixt Rows of Corn, will have occasion for no other\r\nDrill than this Wheat-drill, describ’d in _Fig._ 21. He may plant his\r\nRows at Fifteen Inches asunder, by the hinder Hopper, and its Shares,\r\nwithout removing them, the fore Hopper being taken off; or else you may\r\nplant Three Rows at Sixteen Inches asunder, by setting the Beams, and\r\ntheir Seed-boxes and Hoppers, at Thirty-two Inches asunder instead of\r\nFifteen, equidistant from the fore Share: and then the Marking-wheels,\r\nwhich are those of the fore Spindle, must be Eight Feet asunder; to\r\nwit, double to the Spaces of the Three Shares, which are Three times\r\nSixteen Inches (or Four Feet); or you may set the Two hinder Beams,\r\n_&c._ at what Distance you please, setting the Marking-wheels to\r\ncorrespond with them; but then the Harrow must be alter’d, and both\r\nits Legs and Tines must change their Places in the Head, the Legs for\r\nguiding it exactly, and the Tines to follow in all the Three Rows,\r\nwhich will require a third Tine to be added in the Middle, between the\r\nother Two. But without any other Alteration than that of taking off\r\nthe fore Hopper, and that of lessening the Seed-passages of the hinder\r\nHopper by the Setting-screws; my Man planted me several Acres of St.\r\nFoin with my Wheat-drill Two Years ago, the Rows being all Fourteen\r\nInches asunder: It is now an extraordinary good Crop.\r\n\r\nIn case the Shares, being only Three, should in fine Ground go so deep\r\nas to endanger the Burying of the Seed, the best Remedy to prevent this\r\nfatal Misfortune is, to place a triangular Piece of Wood, like those in\r\n_Figures_ 25. and 26. the first of which shews one Side thereof, with\r\nthe Nail by which it is to be nail’d into the lower Part of the Trunk,\r\nwith, its most acute Angle uppermost; the other in _Fig._ 26. shews\r\nthe same, and its Back-side _a b_, that is to be nail’d to the Back of\r\nthe Shear, being of the same Breadth with it; its Bottom _b c_ being\r\nthe Breadth of the Plates, on their Inside, the Angle _c_ coming out\r\nbackwards, just as far as the Plates: The Depth of this Piece from _a_\r\nto _c_ is uncertain, because the Plates of some Trunks are broader than\r\nof others. The Use of this Piece is, to fill up the lower Part of the\r\nTrunk; so that the Seed, dropping upon the oblique Side of this Piece\r\nof Wood, may by it be turn’d into the Chanel, after so much Mould is\r\nfallen in it, as will sufficiently lessen its Depth, whereby the Danger\r\nof burying the Seed is avoided: And such a Piece of Wood placed into\r\neach Trunk, I think, is preferable to Ground-wrists, which are commonly\r\nused for this Purpose; because the Ground-wrists leave the Chanels too\r\nwide and open.\r\n\r\nBut when only the Two hinder Sheats are used for St. Foin, we can make\r\ntheir Chanels the shallower, by sinking the Limbers by their Chain, so\r\nmuch as that, the Plough bearing most upon the fore Share, the hinder\r\nShares will go the shallower.\r\n\r\nWhen we drill hilly Ground, both up and down, we cover the hinder Parts\r\nof all the Trunks, from their Tops, to within Two or Three Inches of\r\nthe Ground, to prevent the Seed’s falling out far behind the Trunk, in\r\ngoing up Hill; and this we do either by a Piece of Leather nail’d to\r\neach Side of a Sheat, the Middle of the Leather bearing against the\r\nhinder Part of the Plates (or Trunk); or sometimes, instead of Leather,\r\nwe use Tin.\r\n\r\nEvery Trunk being thus inclos’d behind, we can drill up and down an\r\nhill of a moderate Ascent; but when it is very steep, we never drill\r\nany thing but St. Foin on it, and that by a Drill made for the Purpose,\r\nso very light, that a Man may carry it up the Hill on his Back, and\r\ndraw it down after him: This Drill has Five or Six Sheats in one Row\r\n(with the Harrow behind them). Their Shares being extremely short,\r\nthe Standards which draw the Hopper must be set perpendicular to the\r\nHorizon, when the Drill is coming down, rather than to the Surface\r\nof the Side of the Hill: The Funnels must also correspond with the\r\nStandards.\r\n\r\nSome, instead of these Sheats, make use of hollow wooden Harrow-tines,\r\nthro’ which the Seed descends: But these I do not approve of; because\r\nwhere the Ground is hard, and not fine, they rise up, and make no\r\nChanels for the Seed; and then it lying uncover’d will be malted.\r\n\r\nWhen a Drill has only one Rank of Shares, we screw on the Harrow by its\r\nLegs, to the Inside of the Two outside Sheats, as near as we can to\r\ntheir fore Shoulders, leaving sufficient room for the Harrow to rise\r\nand sink, in the same manner as when it is drawn by the Beams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate IV_\r\n\r\n_Page. 378_\r\n\r\n_B. Cole Sculps._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Turnep-Drill._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plate_ 5. shews the whole Mounting of a Turnep-drill. _Fig._ 1. is a\r\nPlough, but little differing from the Drill-plough last mentioned. A,\r\nA, are the Two Limbers, differing in nothing from the other, except\r\nthat they are lighter, not being above Two Inches Diameter, behind the\r\nBar: They are drawn in the same manner as the other. Their Bar B is\r\ndistant from the Plank Three Inches, being shoulder’d at each End, with\r\na very thin flat Tenon, passing thro’ each Limber, and pinn’d on their\r\nOutsides, as at _a a_. We do not pin in this Bar thro’ the Limbers,\r\nlest the Holes should make these very small Limbers the weaker in that\r\nPart. C, the Plank, Two Feet and an Inch long, Five Inches broad, and\r\nan Inch and a quarter thick. D, D, the Two double Standards, or Two\r\nPair of Standards, placed into the Plank with Shoulders above, and\r\nTenons pinn’d underneath the Plank, and are Thirteen Inches high above\r\nit: These serve for a Pair of Marking-wheels, when Turneps are drill’d\r\non the Level, to keep the Rows all parallel, and at what Distance you\r\nplease, by setting them according to the Rule already laid down.\r\n\r\nSometimes we place the double Standards into the Plank of the\r\nWheat-drill, in the same manner that these are placed.\r\n\r\nWe take off the inner Edge of each Standard at the Top, as at _b b_ and\r\n_b b_, for the more easy Admission of the Spindle of the Marking-wheels\r\ninto the Forks: This Spindle is kept in its Place by Two of the same\r\nsort of Wreaths, and placed in the same manner as those describ’d for\r\nthe fore Hopper of the Wheat-drill.\r\n\r\nSuch Marking-wheels are necessary for drilling upon the Level; but not\r\nfor drilling upon Ridges.\r\n\r\nE is the Beam, Two Feet Two Inches and an half long, Four Inches broad,\r\nand Two Inches thick: It is thus broad, that the Screws which hold on\r\nthe cross Piece F, may be farther asunder: The Screws must be placed as\r\nnear as may be to the Outsides of the Beam, and at equal Distance from\r\neach Side of the cross Piece; by which means the Standards are kept the\r\nfirmer from Turning.\r\n\r\nThe Distance between the Plank and the cross Piece is Eleven Inches.\r\nThe Breadth of the cross Piece is Two Inches and a quarter. This cross\r\nPiece is shewn apart in _Fig._ 2. where its Two Standards A B, are each\r\nSeventeen Inches long (or high), and each on its fore Side and hinder\r\nSide One Inch and a quarter broad, and nearly Three quarters of an Inch\r\nthick: They are shoulder’d and pinn’d into the cross Piece at _a b_.\r\nThe cross Piece is Thirteen Inches and an half long, and one Inch and a\r\nquarter thick in the Middle from _c_ to _d_; but for about an Inch on\r\nthe Inside of each Standard is Two Inches and an half thick, that the\r\nStandards may have the more Wood to support them, and that the Hopper,\r\nbearing upon the thicker Parts of the cross Piece, may be held up above\r\nthe Funnel, that the Fork of the brass Spindle may not strike against\r\nit, when the Plough is taken up to be turn’d, there being a little more\r\nthan a quarter of an Inch of the Breadth of the cross Piece behind the\r\nStandard, for the Hopper to rest on.\r\n\r\nThe whole Distance between the Standards is Nine Inches and a quarter.\r\nThe Standards must be exactly perpendicular to their cross Piece: Their\r\nTops are drawn up each to a Point, as at _e_ and _f_, by which the\r\nHopper is the more easily put on upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Funnel, Sheat, Share, and Trunk, are the same as those in the\r\nWheat-drill, except a few Differences: As G in _Fig._ 1. is the same as\r\nthe fore Sheat of the Wheat-drill, with its Accoutrements; only it is\r\nlower, being but Eight Inches high from the Bottom of the Share up to\r\nthe Beam; and the Plates of the Trunk are somewhat narrower: Its Tenon\r\npasses thro’ the Beam, and comes up above it, betwixt the Funnel and\r\nthe cross Piece; and there is pinn’d in thro’ its Hole above the Beam.\r\nThere is no want of Wood behind the Sheat, the Funnel not being cut in\r\nthe Beam, but placed upon it.\r\n\r\nThe Funnel is shewn apart in _Fig._ 3. and is Two Inches deep, Four\r\nInches square at Top; its Four Sides terminating at an Hole in the\r\nBottom, half an Inch broad from _a_ to _b_, and near an Inch long from\r\n_c_ to _d_, which Length is divided in the Middle, by the upper Edge of\r\na Brass Spout, which divides the Hole into Two equal Parts (or Holes),\r\neach of which is about half an Inch square; this Funnel being screw’d\r\non upon the Beam by Two Wood Screws, entering at Two opposite Corners\r\nof the Funnel, as at _c d_ in _Fig._ 1. so that the Seed may drop from\r\nthe Seed-box upon the right Side of the Funnel at _e_, which being\r\nabout half an Inch distant from the Partition, and equidistant from\r\nboth Holes, the Seed rebounding is pretty equally distributed to each\r\nof the Holes.\r\n\r\nThe fore Part of the foremost Hole being equal with the Back of the\r\nSheat, the Beam being cut thro’; so that the Back of the Sheat, and the\r\nfore Part of the Hole thro’ the Beam, and the fore Part of this Hole,\r\nmake one plain Surface, whereby the Seed that falls into this foremost\r\nHole, descends to the Ground, near the Back of the Sheat, thro’ the\r\nTrunk.\r\n\r\nAnd the Seed which falls into the hinder Hole, is convey’d obliquely\r\nbackwards thro’ Part of the Beam, by a short thin Brass Spout, whose\r\nDiameter in the Inside is somewhat more than half an Inch; but the fore\r\nPart of it, which divides the Two Holes, descends first perpendicularly\r\nhalf an Inch, and then turns off backwards, and there the Spout begins\r\nto be round: Its joining is on its hinder Part, to the end that the\r\nSeed, never running upon it, cannot be stopp’d by it. The lower End of\r\nthis Spout ends at the lower Surface of the Beam, a little behind the\r\nPlates of the Trunk, which Hole is seen at _a_ in _Fig._ 4. where this\r\nHole delivers the Seed down into the Spout A, when it is drawn up into\r\nits Place by the String B drawn thro’ the Hole at _b_ in the End of the\r\nBeam, and there tied until it stand in the Posture in which it is seen\r\nat _f_ in _Fig._ 1.\r\n\r\nThe Shape of this Spout is better seen at _Fig._ 5. where A is the\r\nSpout, Four Inches long, a full Inch Diameter in the Inside: Its lower\r\nEnd is circular; but its upper End B is cut at oblique Angles, so that\r\nwhen it is drawn up to its Place, its Edges will touch the lower\r\nSurface of the Beam, and inclose the lower End of the other Spout\r\nwithin it: It is made of thin hammer’d Brass (as is the other). The\r\nEdges of the Piece of Brass, which make this Spout, are join’d on its\r\nhinder Part, for the same Reason that they are so in the other Spout.\r\nAt _b_ there is a Jag cut in one of these Edges, and rais’d upwards, by\r\nwhich Jag the String being tied on the Spout just below, is hindered\r\nfrom slipping upwards.\r\n\r\nJoining to the highest Part, and made with Part of the same Piece of\r\nBrass, turn’d back from the End of the Spout, is its Hinge C, near\r\nThree quarters of an Inch long in its Hollow.\r\n\r\nD is a thin Piece of Iron, half an Inch broad, and a little longer than\r\nthe Top of the Sheat, by which the Spout is held up: This Piece of\r\nIron is riveted by a Rivet passing thro’ an Hole at _c_, and thro’ the\r\nSheat, just before the Trunk, and thro’ another Piece of Iron on the\r\nopposite Side; both the Pieces of Iron, with their upper Edges touching\r\nthe Beam, being thus riveted to the Sheat.\r\n\r\nThe Spout is pinned in by the Screw E, passing as by the prick’d Line F\r\nthro’ the Hole G, and also thro’ the Hinge C, and screw’d into the Hole\r\nof the opposite Piece of Iron, corresponding with the Hole G; and then\r\nit will appear as in _Fig._ 4.\r\n\r\nInstead of these Pieces of Iron, we sometimes use Pieces of Wood, a\r\nlittle broader and thicker, nail’d on the Sheat.\r\n\r\nThe Use of this Spout is for carrying half of the Seed backwards,\r\nso that it may drop upon the Chanel, after the Earth is fallen into\r\nit: By this means the Seed lying very shallow, being only cover’d by\r\na little Earth rais’d by the Harrow, by its Shallowness comes up in\r\nmoist Weather, sooner than the other half, which lies deeper in the\r\nGround; but if the Weather be dry when planted, the deeper half, by\r\nthe Moisture of the Earth from the Dews, will come up first, and the\r\nshallow half will not come up till Rain come to moisten it; so that by\r\nthe shallow or deep, the Turnep-fly is generally disappointed.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 6. shews one of the Tines of a Drill-harrow made of Wood: Its\r\nEdge _a b_ is made roundish at _b_, by which means it raises the Earth\r\non its Sides; but does not drive it before: This Edge from _a_ to _b_\r\nis Six Inches long; from _b_ to _c_, being its Bottom, is One Inch\r\nand a quarter; from _c_ to _d_ is the Back, an Inch and an half thick\r\nat Top, gradually tapering downwards to _c_, where it is half an Inch\r\nthick, being shoulder’d all round: It has a flat Tenon A, which passes\r\nthro’ a Mortise in the Harrow-head; the Length of which Mortise is\r\nparallel with the Length of the Harrow-head, into which it is held by a\r\nPin, passing thro’ the Hole of the Tenon, above the Harrow; as may be\r\nseen in _Fig._ 7. at _a_; and its Fellow at _b_.\r\n\r\nThese Two Tines are Eight Inches asunder at their Points, and Six\r\nInches and a quarter asunder at their upper Parts, just under the\r\nHarrow-head. The fore Edge of the Tine A inclines a little to the Left,\r\nas the Edge of the Tine B doth to the Right.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. shews one of the Legs of the Harrow. At _a_ is seen the round\r\nTenon, which passes thro’ the Harrow-head up to its Shoulder, and is\r\npinned in thro’ an Hole of the Tenon just behind the Harrow-head; upon\r\nthis Tenon the Harrow-head may turn: The other End has an Hole at _b_,\r\nthro’ which it is pinned on to the Beam. The Length of the Leg from the\r\nShoulder at _a_, to the Hole at _b_, is Twenty Inches: Its Thickness is\r\nan Inch and a quarter, and its Breadth an Inch. The Two Legs are seen\r\nmark’d C, D, in _Fig._ 7. They bend down in the Middle, to give the\r\nHarrow the more room for rising and sinking; they are parallel to each\r\nother, and distant a little more than the Breadth of the Beam, that\r\nthey may have Liberty to move thereon, when one End of the Harrow-head\r\nsinks lower than the other, by the Unevenness of the Ground.\r\n\r\nThe Harrow is pinned on to the Beam by the Iron Pin, _Fig._ 9. passing\r\nthro’ the Hole of the Leg at _g_, and thro’ the Beam, and also thro’\r\nthe other Leg on the other Side of the Beam, where the Screw at the End\r\nof the Pin has a Nut screw’d on it. This Pin is round from its Head all\r\nthe Way thro’ the first Harrow-leg, and thro’ the Beam; but all that\r\nPart of the Pin, which is in that Leg against which the Nut is screw’d,\r\nmust be square; whereby that Part being bigger than the round Part of\r\nthe Pin, and than the Hole in the last-mention’d Leg, cannot turn in\r\nthe Hole of that Leg; for if it did, the Nut would be soon unscrew’d\r\nby the Motion of the Harrow; but the Pin must have room to turn in the\r\nother Leg, and in the Beam. This square Part of the Pin is seen at _a_,\r\n_Fig._ 9. The whole Length of the Pin, from its Head to the End of the\r\nsquare Part at _a_, where the Screw begins, is of the Thickness of the\r\nTwo Legs, and of the Breadth of the Beam.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes set the Legs of the Harrow Two Inches wider asunder,\r\nby making them each an Inch thicker at their fore Ends in their\r\nInside, and reaching Five or Six Inches behind their Iron Pin: These\r\nthicker Parts, bearing against the Beam, keep the hinder Part of each\r\nHarrow-leg an Inch distant from the Sides of the Beam, whereby the\r\nHarrow-legs are Six Inches asunder, instead of Four, by means of these\r\nadded Thicknesses.\r\n\r\nWhen a Drill is taken up to be turn’d, the Person that does it, takes\r\nhold of the Harrow-head, and lifts it up: The Legs of the Harrow,\r\nbearing against the cross Piece, support the whole Weight of the Drill.\r\n\r\nWhen the Harrow does not go deep enough, we tie a Stone upon the Middle\r\nof the Harrow-head, by a String that passes thro’ the Holes at _h_. All\r\nthe Wood of this Plough and Harrow is Ash, except the Limbers.\r\n\r\nThe Hopper of the Turnep-drill is very different from those already\r\ndescribed. It consists of a Box placed into the Middle of a Carriage;\r\nwhich Box is described in all its Parts, lying open with their Insides\r\nupwards in _Fig._ 10. A is the fore Side of the Box, Five Inches and an\r\nhalf deep, and Six Inches and an half long. B, the hinder Side of the\r\nBox, opposite to the former, and of equal Dimensions.\r\n\r\nEach End of the Box is made with Three Pieces of Board, of which C the\r\nuppermost is Three Inches and a quarter deep, and Five Inches long;\r\nwhich Length is the Breadth of the Inside of the Box. The End of the\r\nPiece C, when in its Place, stands against the prick’d Line _a b_ in\r\nthe fore Side A; the other End standing against the prick’d Lines in B,\r\nwhich is opposite to, and corresponds with, the prick’d Line _a b_; the\r\nfore Side, and hinder Side, being screw’d to the Ends of this Piece by\r\nFour Screws.\r\n\r\nThe Piece D is Two Inches and a quarter broad, and of the same Length\r\nwith the Piece C, and screw’d up to the Bottom of it with Two Screws,\r\nand then its End will bear against the prick’d Line _b c_, and that\r\nwhich is opposite to it in the Side B.\r\n\r\nE is the lower Piece of this End, and an Inch and a quarter broad: Its\r\nEnd is to stand against the prick’d Line _c d_, and its other End at\r\nthe opposite prick’d Line in B. The Piece D must be screw’d upon the\r\nupper Edge of the Piece E, as the Bottom F must be screw’d up to its\r\nunder Edge, which will stand upon the prick’d Line _e f_. The Three\r\nPieces G, H, I, being opposite to C, D, E, and of the same Dimensions\r\nwith them, placed in the same manner, make the other End of this Box.\r\nAt _g_ in the Bottom F, appears the Hole which is over the Mortise of\r\nthe Brass Seed-box, the Shape and Size of which Hole may be seen by the\r\nprick’d Lines upon the Flanches B, C, of _Fig._ 9. in _Plate_ 2. The\r\nforemost End of which Hole reaches almost as far forwards as the End\r\nof the Axis of the Tongue of the Brass Seed-box, and its hinder End\r\nalmost as far as the hinder End of its Cover[269]. The Bottom F, being\r\nof the same Length, with C, D, E, and their Opposites, bears against\r\nthe prick’d Line _d h_ of the fore Side A, and against the opposite\r\nprick’d Line of B. The Length of this Bottom F is the Breadth of the\r\nInside of the Box, and its Breadth reaches to the outer Edges of the\r\nPieces E and I, being Three Inches and an half.\r\n\r\n  [269] Commonly it reaches within half a quarter of an Inch; but if\r\n  it should only reach within a quarter of an Inch of them, it would\r\n  not have that ill Consequence at that Distance, as the same Position\r\n  would have in the large Seed-boxes; for, in them, the Seed would,\r\n  in such Case, be apt to bear against the Bottom of the Hopper, and\r\n  obstruct the Motion of the Brass Tongue, which small Seeds cannot do\r\n  in the Turnep-seed Box.\r\n\r\nAll the Jointings of these Pieces must be at right Angles, and so\r\nclose, that no Seed may run out at them. All the Pieces are of Board,\r\nfull half-inch thick, except the Bottom, which is thinner.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 11. shews the Bottom of the Box with its under Side uppermost,\r\nwhere the light Part A is the Bottom-board, covering the Two\r\nEnd-boards, E and I, in _Fig._ 10. The dark Parts B and C are the under\r\nSides of D and H, in _Fig._ 10. At _a_ is the fore End of the Brass\r\nSeed-box screw’d up to this Bottom-board. At _b_ is the hinder End of\r\nthe Brass Seed-box screw’d up in like manner, the outer Edge of the\r\nFlanch of the Seed-box being even with the Edge of the Bottom-board.\r\nThe End of the Brass Spindle, with its Fork, appears at C.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12. shews this Box standing upon its Bottom, with its hinder\r\nSide laid open. At _a_ is the Hole in the Bottom, under which the Brass\r\nSeed-box is fasten’d, with small Iron Screws, square near the Heads,\r\npassing thro’ the Bottom, and thro’ the Holes at each End of the Brass\r\nBox, with their Nuts underneath. The Pins must touch all the Sides of\r\nthe Holes in the Brass, to prevent the Seed-box from moving any Way.\r\n\r\nA is the fore Side of the Box. B the hinder Side lying down. C is the\r\nPiece H of _Fig._ 10. which makes a sort of Shelf in the Box at its\r\nleft End. D at the right End makes another like Shelf, underneath\r\nwhich, the Fork of the Brass Spindle is turn’d by the Crank in the End\r\nof the wooden (false) Spindle. By means of these Shelves, there is\r\nroom for the Two wooden false Spindles to come the further into the\r\nCarriage, without lessening the upper Part of the Box. E and F are the\r\nTwo Ends of the upper Part of the Box, made by the Two Pieces G and C\r\nof _Fig._ 10. When the hinder Side B is rais’d up, and screw’d to these\r\nEnds, the Box is complete.\r\n\r\nWe put a Lid upon this Box, which is hing’d on to its right or left\r\nEnd. This Box (having the Brass Seed-box at its Bottom) is to be placed\r\ninto the Middle of a Frame or Carriage.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 13. shews the Inside of the Carriage lying down. A is the hinder\r\nSide, Eighteen Inches long, Dove-tails and all, and Six Inches broad.\r\nB the fore Side of the same Length with the hinder Side, and Eleven\r\nInches broad. This Five Inches greater Breadth than the hinder Part is,\r\nbecause a greater Height is required on the fore Side, on account of\r\nthe Hopper’s being drawn, and the Plough held up by that and the Pieces\r\nthat must be fix’d to it. C, D, are its Two Ends, Six Inches long,\r\nbeside their Dove-tails, and Six Inches broad. E and F are Two Pieces\r\neach Six Inches long, whose Ends are to stand against the prick’d\r\nLines _a b_ and _c d_ of the hinder Side, and their other Ends against\r\nthe prick’d Lines in the fore Side, which are opposite to these. The\r\nBreadth of each of these Pieces is Four Inches: When they are in their\r\nPlaces, their lower Edges come even with the Bottom of the Carriage.\r\nTheir Use is to support the Ends of the Spindles which come just\r\nthro’ their Holes, after each of them have passed their Hole at its\r\nrespective End of the Carriage.\r\n\r\nAll this Carriage is made of Board full half-inch thick; The Ends C and\r\nD are made of double Thickness by another Piece of Board added to each,\r\nthat covers all their Insides, except their Dove-tails. These Boards\r\nwith which they are lin’d, are nail’d to them, with their Grain going a\r\ndifferent Way, and crossing the Grain of the Board at the End, either\r\nat right or oblique Angles. This prevents the Holes from splitting out,\r\nand makes the Holes of a double Thickness; whereby the Spindle is the\r\nless worn by them, in case there are no Brass Wreaths to enter them.\r\n\r\nThe middle Pieces E and F are lin’d by their whole Surfaces, in the\r\nsame Manner as the Insides of the Ends are lin’d.\r\n\r\nWhen these Ends and middle Pieces are in their Places, a wooden\r\nCylinder, of the exact Diameter of the Holes, is thrust thro’ all Four,\r\nto hold them exactly true, whilst the Ends and middle Pieces are all\r\nscrew’d fast into their Places.\r\n\r\nThe prick’d Lines are drawn all round the Carriage, thro’ the Centres\r\nof the Holes, and at equal Distance from the Bottom of the Carriage,\r\nwhich is an Inch and Three quarters, and the One-eighth of an Inch.\r\nThis prick’d Line is a Direction how high to nail on the Ledgers G and\r\nH, whereon the Box is to stand; and the Distance the upper Surface of\r\nthe Ledger must be above the prick’d Line, is the Semidiameter of the\r\nBrass Spindle; and the Thickness of the Brass Box above the Spindle, or\r\nwhich is the same thing, the Distance between the Centre of the great\r\nHole of the Brass Seed-box, and the Plane of the Top of its Mortise,\r\nbeing half an Inch and half a quarter, strike a Line above the prick’d\r\nLine parallel to it, at this Distance above, and then nail on the\r\nLedger, with its upper Edge at this Line. This, with its opposite\r\nLedger plac’d in the same manner, will support the Box with the Axis\r\nof the Spindle of the Seed-box, at equal Height with the Centres of\r\nthe Holes of the Carriage; so that if those Holes are parallel to, and\r\nequidistant from the fore Side and hinder Side of the Carriage, and the\r\nAxis of the Brass Spindle be placed in the like manner parallel to, and\r\nequidistant from the fore Side and hinder Side of the Box; then when\r\nthe Box is thrust down in its Place, upon these Ledgers, and the wooden\r\n(false) Spindles are placed into their Holes, their Axis will fall into\r\na strait Line with the Axis of the Brass Spindle, as they ought.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 14. shews the Carriage laid open. A is its back Side lying\r\ndown. B is its fore Side standing up. C is the square End of the left\r\n(false) Spindle, whereon a Wheel is to be put up to the Shoulders of\r\nthe Spindle, quite close to the Ends of the Carriage. This Spindle,\r\nbeing an Inch and an half Diameter, is held in its Place, and kept from\r\nmoving end-ways, by Two Wreaths; the one at _a_, bearing against the\r\nInside of the End of the Carriage, the other Wreath at _b_, bearing\r\nagainst the left Side of the middle Piece; which Wreath keeps the\r\nSpindle from moving towards the right Hand, as the other does from\r\nmoving towards the left. D is the square End of the other wooden\r\nSpindle, whereon a Wheel must be placed in the same manner as the other\r\nWheel. This Spindle is kept from moving end-ways by Two Wreaths, in\r\nthe same manner as the other Spindle is; but this right-hand Spindle,\r\nbeing that which turns the Brass Spindle by its Crank, which enters the\r\nFork, should have its Wreaths of Brass, like those describ’d in _Fig._\r\n17. _Plate_ 4. Part of which Wreaths entering about Three quarters\r\nof an Inch into the Hole of the End and middle Part of the Carriage,\r\nbeing firmly screw’d on to the Spindle, prevent the Friction that would\r\notherwise be betwixt the Wood of the Spindle, and the Wood of the\r\nHoles; which Friction wearing the Wood of both, would in time cause\r\nthe Spindle to be loose in its Holes, whereby its Axis would deviate\r\nfrom the strait Line it should make with the Axis of the Brass Spindle,\r\nand make an Angle with it; and then the Crank would change its Place\r\nin the Fork at every Revolution of the Wheels; and if the Hole should\r\nbe worn very wide, and the Spindle worn much less, the Crank might let\r\ngo the Fork; but when the Wood is of this Thickness, and each Hole has\r\nWood in it, with its Grains pointing different ways, it would be many\r\nYears before the Holes would become large enough for this to happen,\r\ntho’ only wooden Wreaths were used; and as to the Two Wreaths of the\r\nleft Spindle, they may be of Wood, because tho’ that Spindle should\r\ngrow loose, it is no Damage; for it only serves to bear up that End of\r\nthe Carriage; but he that has this Sort of Brass Wreaths for the hinder\r\nHopper of a Wheat-drill, may take them thence, and place them upon\r\nthese Spindles, and remove them again to the Wheat-drill when that is\r\nused; for that and the Turnep-drill are very rarely, or never, used at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nE is the Iron Crank, plac’d into the false Spindle, in the manner shewn\r\nat H in _Fig._ 5. of _Plate_ 2. for turning the Brass Spindle by its\r\nFork; but take care that the End of this wooden Spindle do not approach\r\nnearer to the End of the Brass Spindle than the Distance of half an\r\nInch, left, if the inner Wreath should grow loose, the wooden Spindle\r\nmight bear so hard against the Brass one, as to wrench the Seed-box\r\ndown from the Wood, and then the Seed might run out betwixt the\r\nSeed-box and the Bottom to which it is screw’d.\r\n\r\nWhen the hinder Side A is screw’d up against the Ends and middle\r\nPieces, then the Box describ’d, being thrust down into the Carriage,\r\nand standing upon the describ’d Ledgers, and at that Distance from\r\neach End of the Carriage, that the Seed may drop on the Side of the\r\nFunnel, as is before describ’d; the Box is kept in its Place by one\r\nScrew passing thro’ its Back, and the back Side of the Carriage.\r\n\r\nThe Notch F is cut in the Bottom of the hinder Side of the Carriage,\r\nup to the Bottom of the Ledger, for the Convenience of seeing the Seed\r\ndrop into the Funnel.\r\n\r\nThe round Notch G is made in the Bottom of the fore Side of the\r\nCarriage, to make room for one’s Hand to go in there, and turn the\r\nSetting-screw without taking off the Hopper from the Standards.\r\n\r\nThis Box and Carriage, so fix’d together, compose the Turnep-hopper,\r\nwhich is drawn and guided, and also holds up the Plough, by Two hollow\r\nPieces of Wood screw’d on to the Outside of the fore Part of the\r\nCarriage; their Ends H and I appearing a little above the Carriage.\r\n\r\nOne of these hollow Pieces of Wood is shewn in _Fig._ 15. The Breadth\r\nof its Hollow must conform to the Breadth of the Standards, which are\r\nOne Inch and a quarter broad; but we must allow about a quarter of an\r\nInch more in the Hollow for the Swelling of the Wood. The Depth of\r\nthe Hollow must be the Thickness of the Standard that is to go in it,\r\nallowing about the Eighth of an Inch for the Swelling of the Wood.\r\nThe Hollow should be a little deeper in the Middle than at each End;\r\nbecause the Standard ought not to bear against any thing, except at or\r\nnear the upper and lower Part of the Carriage. Altho’ the End of these\r\nPieces come a little higher than the Carriage in this Hopper, yet I\r\nthink it is better that these hollow Pieces come no higher than even\r\nwith the Top, nor descend any lower than even with the Bottom of the\r\nCarriage; and then the Length of each of these Pieces need be no more\r\nthan Eleven Inches, which is the whole Depth of the Carriage.\r\n\r\nThe Wood on each Side of the Hollow, sufficient for the Holes _a_, _a_,\r\n_a_, _a_, must be about half an inch broad. The best way for fixing\r\nthem on, is whilst the Standards are in them, placing a small Piece of\r\nWood at each Corner of the Hollow, betwixt the Standard and the Wood,\r\nto the end that there may be no more room on one Side of a Standard\r\nthan on the other Side; then screw them on (parallel to and equidistant\r\nfrom their respective Ends of the Carriage) by Four small Screws each,\r\nthe one at _c_, _c_, _c_, _c_, and the other at _d_, _d_, with Two\r\nbelow; the Heads of these Screws being on the Inside of the Carriage,\r\nand their Nuts on the Outsides of the hollow Pieces; then pull out\r\nthose little Pieces of Wood, that were to keep the Standards in the\r\nMiddle of the Hollows, whilst the Holes for the Screws were bored, and\r\nthen the Turnep-Hopper is finished, and being put on upon the Standards\r\nA, B, in _Fig._ 16. is ready to go to Work; and in this Figure the\r\nwhole Turnep-drill may be seen as in the Prospect of a Person following\r\nit at Work, except that this Figure has not the double Standard, nor\r\nMarking-wheels; because we never use them for drilling-Turneps, except\r\nit be on the Level, which we very rarely do.\r\n\r\nThe Circles of the Wheels of this Hopper go Twenty five Inches asunder;\r\nwere they farther asunder, they would not go so well upon the Ridges;\r\nor were they nearer together, they might not hold up the Plough so\r\nsteadily, but that one Wheel might happen to be rais’d from the Ground,\r\nby the descending of the opposite Limber; and if it should happen to\r\nbe the Wheel that turns the Crank, no Seed would be deliver’d out\r\nwhilst the Wheel was rais’d above the Ground; sometimes we use Wheels\r\nof Twenty-six Inches Diameter, sometimes Thirty, and at intermediate\r\nDiameters, with this Hopper.\r\n\r\nThe best Wood for making all Sorts of Hoppers is Walnut-tree or Elm;\r\nour Beams and Standards we make of Ash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate. V._\r\n\r\n_P.392_\r\n\r\n_B.Cole Delin et Sculp_]\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by Wood-screws, are taper Screws made with Iron, having\r\nvery deep Threads, whereby they hold-fast when screwed into Wood, and\r\ntheir Points will enter into soft Wood without boring any Hole for them\r\ninto the Wood they are to take hold of; but near their Heads they are\r\nround, and have no Thread, and that Part of them must always be in a\r\nbored Hole thro’ that Part of a Board that is to be drawn close.\r\n\r\nIf the Standards should be much swollen by being wet, it may be proper\r\nto anoint them with Soap.\r\n\r\nIn drilling, when the Wind is very strong, and the Hopper goes high\r\nabove the Funnel, the Seed might be blown over it, if we did not take\r\ncare to guard it from the Force of the Wind; and for doing this there\r\nare many Ways: Sometimes we nail a Piece of Linen Cloth round the Ends,\r\nand the fore Side of the Hopper; or else we nail on a Piece of old Hat,\r\nor Shoe-leather, round the Edges of the Funnel, to raise it higher; or\r\nif the Hopper go a great deal above the Trunk, we nail up a Pipe of\r\nLeather to the wooden Bottom of the Box, which Pipe, being about an\r\nInch wide at Bottom, protects the Seed from the Wind, till it arrives\r\nso near the Funnel, that the Wind cannot blow it over.\r\n\r\nIf we would have a long Hopper, to plant many Rows at once, of Clover\r\nor other fine Seeds, it is easy to make each of these wooden (false)\r\nSpindles turn Two or Three Brass or Iron Spindles; but then, as in all\r\nother Cases; where the same Hopper is to supply more than one Chanel\r\nwith Seed, each of its Wheels must have Liberty to rise without the\r\nother, as those of the hinder Hopper of the Wheat-drill do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the_ HOE-PLOUGH, _&c._\r\n\r\n_Plate_ 6. _Fig._ 1. is the Hoe-Plough in a side View. A is the Beam\r\nand Plough-tail, being much the same with that of the common Plough\r\ndescribed in _Fig._ 1. of _Plate_ 1. The Beam of such a common Plough,\r\nbeing cut off, and screwed up to this Plank, and its Limbers, might\r\nmake a Hoe-Plough. The Share of this, from its Tail to the fore Part\r\nof its Socket, is Two Feet One Inch long, and from thence to the End\r\nof the Point, Ten Inches and an half: This is the Measure of the under\r\nSide of the Share. B is the Plank, Two Feet Seven Inches and an half\r\nlong, Two Inches and an half thick, and Nine Inches broad. C, D, are\r\nthe Nuts of the Two Screw-pins, which hold up the Beam to the Plank. E\r\nis the Nut of the Draw-pin, which Pin has a Crook underneath, whereto\r\none of the Links of the short Chain of the Whipper is fastened for\r\ndrawing the Plough; the only Use of this Nut is, to hold the Pin from\r\ndropping out by its own Weight, and that of the Chain and Whipper; but\r\noften, to avoid the Trouble of screwing and unscrewing the Nut, we\r\nsupply its Use by a square Pin a little bigger than the Hole, which we\r\ndrive up by an Hammer, so tight, that it may not drop out of itself;\r\nbut can easily be driven out by a few Blows of the Hammer, as often\r\nas it is necessary to remove it into another Hole. F, G, are the Two\r\nLimbers; they are screwed on to the Plank by Four Screws and Nuts: The\r\nunder Surface of the Limbers by their whole Length are parallel to the\r\nPlank, and to the upper Surface of the fore End of the Beam, contrary\r\nto the manner of placing the Limbers of the Drill Ploughs; because\r\ntheir Planks being always parallel to the Bottom of their Shares, if\r\ntheir Limbers were parallel to their Beams, as these are, the fore Ends\r\nof their Limbers would not be elevated higher than the Plank, but would\r\ngo within a Foot of the Ground, instead of being elevated almost as\r\nhigh as the Horses that draw them; and the upper and under Surfaces of\r\nthis Plank must not be parallel to the Share, but must make the same\r\nAngle with it as its Limbers and Beam do.\r\n\r\nThese Limbers ought to crook outwards from each other all the Way,\r\ntill they come within about a Foot of the Chain, much more than the\r\nDrill-Limbers need to do; because the Middle of the Plank of the Drill\r\nfollows directly after the Horse, but the Middle of the Plank of the\r\nHoe-Plough very seldom does; and therefore there must be the more room\r\nbetwixt these Limbers. Likewise there must be the more room betwixt the\r\nfore Part of the Limbers, because oftentimes the right Limber must be\r\nraised, and the left depressed, in holding the Plough towards the left\r\nSide (for if it should be held towards the right Side, the Share would\r\ngo upon the Fin, and its Point be raised out of the Ground, unless it\r\nwere on a Surface that had a Declivity towards the Right). The Distance\r\nbetween the fore Ends of these Limbers is Two Feet Eight Inches.\r\n\r\nThe Strength and Stiffness of these Limbers must be such, that there\r\nmay be no Bending betwixt their fore Ends and the Tail of the Beam;\r\nfor if they be too weak, so as to yield to the Weight of the Furrow,\r\nthe Point of the Share will descend into the Ground, and its Tail will\r\nrise up, and then the Plough cannot go well. The shorter they are, the\r\nstronger and stiffer will they be, of the same Thickness. We may make\r\nthem just of such a Length, that there may be room for the Horse before\r\nthe Bar H (which holds the Limbers at their due Distance). These are\r\nfrom their Ends to the Bar, Four Feet Ten Inches long and from thence\r\nto the Plank Ten Inches, and Three Inches and an half square at the Bar.\r\n\r\nI is the Whipper. K, L, are its Notches, whereunto the Traces both\r\nof the Thiller, and of the Horse next before him, are fastened. The\r\nLength of the Whipper is uncertain; but when we hoe betwixt Rows, when\r\nthe Plants are grown high, we make it as short as it can be, without\r\ngalling the Horse’s Legs by the Traces.\r\n\r\nWe set this Plough to go deeper or shallower by the Chain of the\r\nLimbers; the changing of whose Links to the Crook M has the same Effect\r\nas changeing the Pins to different Holes of the Crow-staves of a common\r\nPlough.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 2. is the Beam with its Mortise and Holes; its Crooking down at\r\nthe Tail is not very material; but it causes the hinder Sheat to be\r\na little the shorter below the Beam, whereby it may be something the\r\nlighter, and yet of the same Strength as if it were longer. Its whole\r\nLength is Four Feet Ten Inches: We make its Breadth and Thickness such,\r\nthat it may be as light as it can be without Bending. A is the Mortise\r\nthro’ which the hinder Sheat passes. B is the Mortise for the fore\r\nSheat, upon which it is pinned up. C is a Hole in the Beam, into which\r\nthe End of the left Handle being driven, holds it from moving, and is\r\nthe best Manner of fastening this Handle of a Plough. D, E, are the\r\nHoles, thro’ which the Two Legs of the double Retch pass, and are there\r\nheld up by their Nuts. F is the Coulter-hole. G is the hinder Hole, by\r\nwhich the Plough is held up to the Plank. H and I are the Two foremost\r\nHoles of the Beam, thro’ one or the other of which passes the Pin which\r\nholds the Beam to the fore Part of the Plank. These Holes must be made\r\nas near together as they can be, without Danger of splitting them one\r\ninto another; to prevent which there are several Ways: The one is by\r\ndriving in Two square Pins cross the Beam, under the pricked Line _a\r\nb_, before the Holes are bored, which will prevent the Grain of the\r\nWood from being forced out of one Hole into the other; or these Holes\r\nmay be plated with Iron above and below, which will have the same\r\nEffect, and then there need not be more than One Inch between Hole and\r\nHole.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 3. is the Plank apart, which by its Holes, and pricked Lines,\r\nshews the different Manner of placing the Beam. _a_, _a_, _a_, _a_, are\r\nthe Four Holes for screwing down the Limbers to the Plank.\r\n\r\nSupposing the Path of the Horse to be a strait Line, and the pricked\r\nLine _h i_ (which is at right Angles with the Plank, and equidistant\r\nfrom each Limber) to go exactly over it, without making any Angle on\r\neither Side of it; then the Beam must be placed at right Angles with\r\nthe Plank, to the End that the Share may go parallel to the Horse-path,\r\nexcepting that very small Inclination that its Point has to the left,\r\nshewn by the pricked Lines in _Fig._ 1. of _Plate_ 1. But this Plough\r\nseldom follows the Horse in that manner. The said pricked Line _h i_\r\ngenerally makes Angles with the Horse-path; else when the Beam stood\r\nnear the left Limber, and the Draw-pin near the right Limber in the\r\nHole 9. (which it must do to keep the Share parallel to the Horse-path)\r\nthe Weight of the right End of the Plank and its Limber would be too\r\nheavy for the right Hand of the Holder to manage; and if the Draw-pin\r\nbe removed (suppose) to Hole 7. the Parallelism of the Share with the\r\nHorse-path will be lost, and the Point of the Share may be inclined too\r\nmuch towards the Left; and when a Furrow is to be plowed on the right\r\nSide of the Horse-path, the Beam must be removed nearer to the Middle\r\nof the Plank, and the Draw-pin must be placed on the left Side of the\r\nBeam, suppose to the Hole 2. This will bring the greatest Part of the\r\nPlank to the right Side of the Horse-path; and then the Share, standing\r\nat right Angles with the Plank, will make a very large Angle with the\r\nHorse-path, and then the Plough will not perform at all. Therefore it\r\nbeing necessary, that the Share always go parallel to the Horse-path,\r\nand often as necessary that the Plank go at oblique Angles to the\r\nHorse-path; it follows then that the Beam stand at oblique Angles with\r\nthe Plank, to preserve the Parallelism to the Horse-path; and this\r\ncannot be done but by the Holes which are shewn under the pricked Lines\r\nwhich cross the Plank.\r\n\r\nThe Holes A, B, C, are those to one of which the Beam is screwed up by\r\nits Hole G, in _Fig._ 2. These Holes are made as near to the hinder\r\nEdge of the Plank, as they can safely be, without Danger of tearing\r\nout; which is generally about an Inch distant from the said Edge.\r\n\r\nEvery one of these Holes are answered by Three others, near the fore\r\nEdge of the Plank, as the Hole B has, at the fore Edge of the Plank,\r\nthe Holes D, E, F, D, E belong to the Hole I of the Beam _Fig._ 2.\r\nThese Two Holes are made as near together as they can be without\r\nbreaking into one another. F answers the Hole H in _Fig._ 2. and is\r\nmade between D and E, as near them as safely it can.\r\n\r\nWhen the Beam is screwed up at B and F, and makes the same Angles with\r\nthe Plank, as the pricked Line _b c_ doth; then the Draw-pin standing\r\nin the Hole 8 or 9, will bring the Plough so much to the Left, that the\r\nShare will point too much towards the Right; then remove the fore End\r\nof the Beam to the Hole D, and then the Beam will make the same Angle\r\nwith the Plank as the pricked Line _c d_, which may bring the Share to\r\nbe parallel to the Horse-path nearly enough: But if the Draw-pin should\r\nbe placed in the Hole 1. then the Plank would go so much on the Right\r\nof the Horse-path, that the Share would point vastly too much towards\r\nthe Left, standing in either of these Two Positions: Therefore the\r\nforemost Pin must be removed to the Hole E, and then the Beam being\r\nat the same Angles with the Plank as the pricked Line _f g_, it may be\r\nparallel to the Horse-path, or so nearly, that by removing the Draw-pin\r\none Hole, it may be made perfectly so.\r\n\r\n_Note_, That tho’ here are but Nine Holes for the Draw-pin; yet we\r\nusually make many more in our Planks: And sometimes by changing the\r\nDraw-pin either Way into another Hole, tho’ that Hole be but an Inch\r\ndistant from the former, the Share is brought right without any\r\nInconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe Holes A and C have each of them their opposite Holes, which (when\r\nthe Beam is placed into either of the Two) have the same Effect, for\r\nkeeping the Share parallel to the Horse-path, as the Hole B and its\r\nThree opposite Holes have; and if either of the Holes belonging to A,\r\nB, or C, should not bring the Beam sufficiently oblique to the Plank,\r\nfor the Share to be parallel to the Horse-path, when the Draw-pin is\r\nin some one particular Hole, then there may be another Hole bored\r\nbefore, on the Right or Left, for the fore Pin to pass thro’ by the\r\nHole H of the Beam _Fig._ 2. which will incline the Beam a little\r\nmore to the Right or Left, as occasion requires; and if none of all\r\nthese be sufficient, the Plank may be turned the other Side upwards;\r\nand the Beam being fastened there by the hinder Screw into any one of\r\nthose Holes, which were next to the fore Edge of the Plank before it\r\nwas reversed, there may be a new Set of Holes to answer the fore Pin,\r\nof which that which was an hinder Hole before the Plank was reversed,\r\nmay be one. These may set the Beam at different Angles from any of the\r\nfirst Holes; so that there may be at one End of the Plank Six Systems\r\nof Holes, Three on the one Side, and Three on the other; and if we have\r\na mind to make yet more various Positions of the Plough, we may turn\r\nthe Plank, End for End, and there make Six different Systems of Holes.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of turning the Plank, it would be better to have a Fourth\r\nHole in the Beam, standing as near to the hinder Hole as H doth to the\r\nfore Hole; to answer which Fourth Hole, there may be Two Holes in the\r\nPlank, one at each Side of the hinder Hole of every System at proper\r\nDistances, to set the Plough still at more different Angles with the\r\nPlank; and these, I believe, will be more convenient for the Purpose\r\nthan the different Holes in the fore Part of the Plank, it being easier\r\nto remove the hinder Screw than the fore Screw; because if the Plank\r\nand Limbers are not held up by somebody, whilst the fore Pin is out,\r\ntheir Weight will wrench out the hinder Hole of the Plank by that\r\nScrew; but whilst the hinder Screw is out, there is no need of holding\r\nup the Plank, because its Weight, bearing upon the Beam, cannot injure\r\nthe foremost Hole, whilst the Limbers bear upon the Horse. Upon this\r\naccount, I wonder we had not made the Holes, for changing the Position\r\nof the Beam, at the hinder Part of the Plank rather than the fore Part;\r\nwhich convinces me, that new Instruments are seldom perfect in the\r\nBeginning.\r\n\r\nWe can also alter the Standing of the Beam, by cutting away the Wood on\r\none Side of an Hole, and placing a Wedge on the opposite Side of the\r\nPin.\r\n\r\nThe Holder may make some Alteration in the Going of the Plough by the\r\nHandles.\r\n\r\nThe Reason we never set the Beam on the right Half of the Plank is,\r\nthat the Plough always turns its Furrow towards the Right-hand; and the\r\nstrait Side of the Share and the Coulter never go so near to a Row on\r\nthe Right-hand, by the Breadth of Two Furrows, as it does to a Row on\r\nthe Left-hand.\r\n\r\nIf by the Drawing of the fore Horse or Horses, the Plough should bear\r\ntoo hard upon the Thiller, it may be helped by making a Row of Holes\r\nnear the hinder Side of the Plank, for the Draw-pin, instead of those\r\nin the Middle; for the farther backwards the Draw-pin is plac’d, the\r\nless will the Limbers bear on the Thiller, especially when drawn by\r\nmore Horses than one; because the fore Horses draw the Limbers more\r\ndownwards than the Thiller doth, as may be seen in _Fig._ 4.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 4. shews the manner how the Hoe-plough is drawn, and how the\r\nTraces are fix’d to it. The Traces of both Horses are fastened to the\r\nNotches of the Ends of the Whipper at _a_ and _b_. The Traces of the\r\nThiller by their fore Part are fastened to an Hook, or Ring, on the\r\nWood of the Collar, as is usual for other Thillers; and the fore Part\r\nof the next Horse’s Traces is fastened to his Collar in like manner;\r\nbut these Traces, being twice as long as those of the Thiller, must be\r\nheld up in the Middle by a Piece of Cord or Chain, as at _c_, where\r\none End of it is fastened to the Trace, and passes over the Top of\r\nthe Collar, behind one of the Hames, and before the other to keep it\r\nfrom slipping backwards or forwards; its other End is fastened to the\r\nopposite Trace on the other Side, as this End is at _c_. This prevents\r\nthe Chain from falling down, and getting under the Horse’s Legs in\r\nturning; but beware that this String or Chain be not so short as to\r\nhold up the Traces higher than their strait Line; for that would press\r\nupon the Collar, and gall the Thiller, besides occasioning the Plough\r\nto be drawn too much upwards; for this drawing of the fore Horse by\r\na different Line from that of the Thiller, is a great Advantage for\r\nkeeping the Plough the firmer into the Ground.\r\n\r\nIf there is another Horse, his Traces are fastened at the Collar of the\r\nSecond, in the same manner as in drawing of a Waggon.\r\n\r\nWhen we hoe betwixt Rows, where the Plants are very high, as those\r\nof Turnep-seed, which are much higher than the Horses, to turn a new\r\nFurrow up to the Row, when there is a Trench in the Middle of the\r\nInterval, where the Horses must go, we find it best to place the Beam\r\nby the Holes B and E, in _Fig._ 3. and the Draw-pin near the left\r\nLimber, which brings the Tail of the Plough to the Right-hand, and the\r\nfore Ends of the Limbers being towards the Left, the End of the right\r\nLimber (by turning the Handles a little to the Left) bears against the\r\nwooden Saddle at _d_, and cannot hitch into or take hold of any of the\r\nPlants to tear them. And that no Part of the Limber may take hold of\r\nany Plant, we make it very smooth from one End to the other; and cut\r\noff the Corner of the Plank equal with the Limber, that the Plants may\r\nslip by it without hanging in it, or being broken by it. The Whipper\r\nstanding towards the left End of the Plank, its End _b_ does not reach\r\nso far towards the right as to take hold of the Plants, its End _a_\r\nbeing over the Interval, where no Plants are; and to keep its right End\r\nthe more out of Danger of hurting the Plants, we place the Hook of its\r\nChain nearer towards this End, by which means the left End, becoming\r\nheavier, sinks lower, and raises the right End higher; and the higher\r\nit is, the more secure the Plants will be from it; because they are\r\nheld off by the Limber above.\r\n\r\nThis way my Turnep-seed has been ho’d, when one would have thought\r\nit impossible for a Plough and Horses to go betwixt the Rows without\r\ndestroying the Crop. Almost in this manner we give our Wheat the\r\nlast Hoeing, to turn the Furrow a Second time towards the Row. When\r\nthe Plants of the Rows are very high, the Driver must go in the next\r\nInterval, on the Left of the Plough; and the Holder has a Cord, like\r\nthe Reins of a Bridle, which he lays over the End of the Draw-pin,\r\nwhich keeps it from falling down, until he has occasion to use it for\r\nguiding or turning the Thiller.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn the Furrow from the Row (which will then be ever on the\r\nleft Side of the Plough), the Plough must be set in a very different\r\nand contrary Posture; but then the Plants commonly being low, there is\r\nno Danger of the Whipper’s or Limber’s hitching or taking hold of them;\r\nbut the Driver must take care, that he does not tread on them, nor\r\nsuffer any of the Horses to do so; and they of themselves, when they\r\nare not blind, take all the Care they can to avoid it; and I observe,\r\nthat the Plants are oftener injured by the Driver, than by the Horses.\r\n\r\n’Tis in this last-mentioned manner of Hoeing, when we go very near to\r\nthe young Plants, the First or Second time, that we must take care of\r\nburying them with the Earth, which (especially when dry and fine) is\r\napt to run over to the left Side of the Plough; this we can in great\r\nmeasure prevent, when the Ground is clean, by nailing with Three or\r\nFour Nails a very thin square Piece of Board to the Sheat, with one\r\nCorner bearing at, or below, _a_, in _Fig._ 1. and its other lower\r\nCorner bearing on the Back of the Coulter on its left Side at _b_, its\r\nupper Corner reaching to _c_ or higher; its fore End is ty’d on to the\r\nCoulter by a leathern Thong passing thro’ an Hole very near the End\r\nof the Board. The lower Edge of the Board must come no lower than the\r\nprick’d Line _a_, _b_, which, at _b_, is just even with the Surface\r\nof the Ground, before it is rais’d by the Share; for if this Board\r\nshould be set down too near the Share, the Plough would not go; but,\r\nbeing set in this manner, it prevents the Earth (when never so much\r\npulveriz’d in the driest Weather) from running over upon the Plants to\r\nbury them, tho’ the Plough go very near them; except in this case, we\r\nnever use a Board, the Earth running over to the left Side, being often\r\nadvantageous in Hoeing; for it changes more Surface of the Ground,\r\nthan if it went all to the right; and when in Summer we hoe from the\r\nWheat-rows, not going very near to the grown Plants, this Earth that\r\nruns over the Share to the Left, helps to mend such Places where the\r\nFurrow was not thrown up close enough to the Row by the precedent\r\nHoeing.\r\n\r\nThe first time we turn a Furrow towards the Row, the Horses go in\r\nthe Trench near to it, and the Plough stands on the left Side of the\r\nHorse-path, almost in the same manner as when the Furrow is turn’d from\r\nthe Row; but we very often make use of a common Plough, for throwing\r\ndown the Ridge, which has lain all the Winter in the Middle of the\r\nInterval. One Wheel, going on each Side of that Ridge, holds that\r\nPlough to a great Exactness for splitting this Ridge into Halves, which\r\nthe Earth-board, being set out for that Purpose, throws up to the Row\r\non each Side of the Interval.\r\n\r\nWe also very often make use of the Two-wheel’d Plough, for raising up\r\nthe Ridges, whereon we drill the Rows; not but that the Hoe-Plough\r\nwill do every thing that is necessary to our Husbandry: Yet the common\r\nPloughs being heavier than we usually make our Hoe-Ploughs, they by\r\ntheir Weight, and Help of their Wheels go a little steadier: and\r\nbesides the Ploughmen, being more accustom’d to them, prefer them\r\nbefore all other, where their Wheels are of no Prejudice.\r\n\r\nI never saw neater Ridges rais’d by any Plough, than by the Hoe-Plough,\r\nnor finer Plowing; and I believe that were it made as heavy, and as\r\nstrong, it would outdo the Swing-Plough, in plowing miry Clays, where\r\nPlough-wheels cannot go; but I, haveing no such Land, have never\r\nmade any Hoe-Plough heavy enough for it. However, I am convinc’d, by\r\nthe many Trials which I have seen, that no other Plough can be used\r\nfor every Horse-hoeing Operation, so effectually as this I have now\r\ndescrib’d.\r\n\r\nThe making the Hoe-plough is not difficult for a good Workman; and\r\na few of the Holes for setting the Beam are sufficient, provided\r\nthey are made in their proper Places, which is impossible for me to\r\ndescribe exactly in a Number that is no more than necessary; because\r\nthe Distance the Plough must go from the Horse-path on either Side,\r\nis uncertain, as the Largeness or the Depth of the Furrow is; and for\r\nthat Reason, it is as impossible for me direct the Ploughman to the\r\nparticular Angles, at which his Beam must be set with the Plank, to\r\nkeep the Share parallel to the Horse-path, as it is to direct a Fidler,\r\nhow far he must turn his Pegs to give his Strings their due Tension\r\nfor bringing them all in Tune, which without a Peg to each String\r\ncould never be done; but when he has his just Number of Pegs, his Ear\r\nwill direct him in turning them, till his Fiddle is in Tune; so the\r\nPloughman by his Eyes, his Feeling, and his Reason, must be directed\r\nin the setting his Plough; but without a competent Number of Holes, he\r\ncan no more do it than a Musician can tune Four Strings upon one Peg.\r\nAnd I am told, that some Pretenders to making the Hoe-Plough have fix’d\r\nits Beam to the Plank immoveable, which makes it as useless for hoeing\r\nbetwixt Rows, as a Violin with but one Peg to its Four Strings would be\r\nfor playing a _Sonata_.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 5. shews the Sort of Yoke, that is us’d on every Ox that\r\ndraws in a single File, as they always must when they work with the\r\nHoe-plough; but after they have been accustom’d to draw double (_i. e._\r\nTwo abreast) they must be practis’d for about a Week to draw single,\r\nbefore they are set to Hoeing; for otherwise they will be apt to\r\ndemolish the Rows, one running off to the right-hand, expecting his\r\nFellow to come up with him on the Left, and another will run off on\r\nthe Left to make room for his Companion to go abreast with him on the\r\nRight, endeavouring to go in the manner in which they us’d to be placed\r\nfor drawing in Pairs.\r\n\r\nI suppose I need not give any Caution about muzling the Oxen when they\r\nhoe; because they will eat the Plants as soon as they come an Inch\r\nabove the Ground, and that will shew the Necessity of it; but there is\r\nno occasion to muzzle the Horses until the Plants are grown as high as\r\ntheir Noses, when rein’d up, as in _Fig._ 4.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 6. is an Instrument of Pulveration, which might have been\r\nsufficiently describ’d by its Matter, Weight and Dimensions, without\r\nany Portrait, were it not to shew the particular Manner of drawing\r\nit, being very different from that of a common Roller, whose Frame is\r\ndifficult to make, and costly; but this, being only Three Feet long, is\r\ndrawn by a simple Pair of Limbers, held together, by the Two Bars A and\r\nB, firmly pinn’d in at their Ends.\r\n\r\nIts Gudgeons must not come out beyond the outer Surface of the Limbers,\r\nlest they should take hold of the Plants, when drawn in the Intervals;\r\nalso the hinder Ends of the Limbers, behind the Gudgeon, should crook a\r\nlittle upwards, for the same Reason.\r\n\r\nThis Stone Cylinder is Two Feet and an half Diameter, and weighs Eleven\r\nhundred Weight besides the Limbers. It must never be us’d but in the\r\ndriest Weather, when neither the Plough nor Harrow can break the Clods;\r\nand then being so very ponderous and short, it crushes them to Powder,\r\nor into such very small Pieces, that a very little Rain, or even the\r\nDews (if plentiful), will dissolve them.\r\n\r\nI have had great Benefit by this Roller in preparing my Ridges for\r\nTurneps. The Weather proving dry at _Midsummer_ (which is the best\r\nSeason for planting them), the Land was in Pieces like Horse-heads, so\r\nthat there was no Hope of reducing them fit for planting with Turneps\r\nthat Year; the Clods being so very large, that they would require\r\nso many Vicissitudes of wet and dry Weather to slack them; but this\r\nInstrument crush’d them small, and the Plough following it immediately,\r\nthe Ridges were harrow’d and drill’d with very good Success.\r\n\r\nI have also made use of it for the same Purpose in the Middle of a\r\ncloddy Field, where it pulveriz’d the Clods so effectually, that the\r\nBenefit of it might be plainly distinguish’d by the Colour and Strength\r\nof the Two following Crops, different from the other Parts of the Field\r\nadjoining on both Sides, whereon the Roller was not drawn.\r\n\r\nBut crushing has such a contrary Effect from squeezing, that if\r\nthis Roller should be us’d when the Land is moist, it would be very\r\npernicious, by unpulverizing it; of which I am so cautious, that\r\nsometimes I let the Roller lie still for a whole Year together.\r\n\r\nThere is also a long triangular Harrow, which is sometimes useful in\r\nthe Intervals when the Earth is of a right Temper betwixt wet and dry;\r\nbut there is no need to describe it, and I scarce use it once in Two or\r\nThree Years.\r\n\r\nThe Diameters of the wooden and iron Pins and Screws, with their Holes,\r\nand the Sizes of the Nails to be made use of in all the describ’d\r\nInstruments, I leave to the Discretion of the Workmen, who, if they are\r\nMasters of their several Trades, cannot be ignorant of such Matters.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. and _Fig._ 8. shew the Lands of Turneps mention’d at the\r\nBeginning of this Work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nCONCERNING\r\n\r\n_The making of the_ DRILL, _and the_ HOE-PLOUGH, _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a Workman, who would make these Instruments, I would add the\r\nfollowing Directions.\r\n\r\nThe First thing to be done for making the Drill, is to place half a\r\nSheet of Paper to the Back of Plate 2. by pasting it on to its Margin;\r\nand likewise another half Sheet to Plate 3. in the same manner.\r\n\r\nThen with a Needle prick through all the Out-lines of A, B, C, and\r\nD, in _Fig._ 2. which will mark out both Sides, and both Ends of the\r\nMortise of the Turnep Drill-box. Also prick through the Out-lines\r\nof the great Hole in the middle of A, and of the elliptical Hole\r\nin B. Also prick the little Hole at E, in A; and at F, in B. Prick\r\nthrough the prick’d Line _p q_, in B; which is the Line to which the\r\nSetting-screw _Fig._ 6. or _Fig._ 12. that is to pass through the Hole\r\nin C, must be parallel.\r\n\r\nWhen the Paper is taken off, cut out of it the said A, B, C, and D, by\r\nthe Pricks made by the Needle.\r\n\r\nThen cut the same in Pastboard, by laying these Pieces of Paper thereon\r\n(because Pastboard, being stiffer than Paper, will be more fit for the\r\nUse). Draw a Line with Ink on the pricked Line, _p q_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate. VI._\r\n\r\n_Page.408_\r\n\r\n_B. Cole. Delin. et Sculp._]\r\n\r\nThe Hole in C must be something larger than in the Cut, because the\r\nSetting-screw must be so, being best to be of Brass, which is less apt\r\nto rust than Iron, of which Metal it was formerly made; but Brass,\r\nbeing weaker, requires the more of it to equal the Strength of Iron.\r\n\r\nThe Wreath, _Fig._ 14. is not necessary, because the Slider, _Fig._ 15.\r\nis sufficient without it; but then care must be taken, that the Edges\r\nof its Claws A B, which rub against the Cylinder of E, in _Fig._ 9. be\r\ntaken off, to prevent their cutting it. This Slider is sometimes made\r\nof Brass, and sometimes of Iron.\r\n\r\nThus the Workman will have the Sides and Ends of the Turnep-mortise,\r\nwhich make the Whole of it, whereby he may make it exactly in soft Wood.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. called the inner Cylinder, being put into the Cylinder A,\r\nof the Steel Tongue, _Fig._ 4. whereby the Holes for the Axis of the\r\nTongue, being the lower from the Top of the Mortise, do not only secure\r\nthe Edges of the Mortise from breaking out, but also give room for the\r\nFlanches B, C, in _Fig._ 9. to be made to reach as far forwards as the\r\nAxis of the Tongue, and farther: Hereby the Hole, in the Bottom of the\r\nHopper, may be as wide at the fore End, as at the pricked Line at the\r\nLetter B.\r\n\r\nThe Notches in the Spindle, _Fig._ 5. seem to appear deeper than is\r\nusual for Turnep-seed; but I remember I have drilled Furze-seed with a\r\nTurnep-drill without altering the Notches. As for the Shape of these\r\nNotches, they are so fully described in _Fig._ 6. and _Fig._ 8. of\r\n_Plate_ 3. that I can add nothing to that Description; only that those\r\nbeing for the Wheat-drill, the Size of Notches for the Turnep-drill\r\nmust be lesser in some proportion to the lesser Size of the Seed.\r\n\r\nFor making the Wheat-drill do the same as for the Turnep-drill. The\r\n_Fig._ 3. in _Plate_ 2. is one Side of the Mortise, by which must\r\nbe made Two in Pastboard. _Fig._ 10. in _Plate_ 2. and _Fig._ 9. in\r\n_Plate_ 3. are the Two Ends of it.\r\n\r\nThe Cover that prevents the Wheat from falling down on the hinder Side\r\nof the Spindle, is one intire Piece of Brass, which is marked B in\r\n_Fig._ 3. of _Plate_ 3. but the Shape of it, with its Hole whereby it\r\nis held in by a Screw, is only seen in the Side, _Fig._ 3. of _Plate_\r\n2. and there described by pricked Lines; and by pricking through them,\r\nthe Shape of the End of the Cover may be taken, which Cover is of the\r\nsame Shape from End to End.\r\n\r\nThe Joyner who cannot by these Additions, and the Explanations of the\r\n_Plates_, make these Drills in Wood, doth not deserve the Name of a\r\nWorkman.\r\n\r\nWhen he has once made them whole, he can easily make them in Halves\r\nlike _Fig._ 8. in _Plate_ 2.\r\n\r\nBy these Halves the Founder will make his Moulds proper for casting\r\nthem in the best Brass. But in these Halves for Casting, there must be\r\nno other Holes, but the great Holes, and the Hole for the Setting-screw.\r\n\r\nThe great Hole in the Mould must be largest at E, in _Fig._ 9. _Plate_\r\n2. and lesser in the Inside in _Fig._ 8. for as it must be of a conical\r\nShape for making the Core, if it should be cast bigger within, when\r\nthe Whitesmith bores it (as he must) to an exact Cylinder, the End E\r\nwould be in Danger of bursting by the Force of the Boring, as it is\r\nmuch thinner than in the Mortise. And besides this, if there should be\r\nany little Flaw in the Edges of the Hole within the Mortise (which the\r\nFounder must avoid as much as possible), it may perhaps be bored out by\r\nmeans of the Hole’s being less there. The Hole must be something less\r\nin the Mould than its proper Size, even where it is largest; else it\r\nmay happen, that in boring it to a true Cylinder it may become too big.\r\nAnd I believe, in the Cooling of the Brass, the Hole grows bigger as\r\nthe Spindle grows less.\r\n\r\nFor the Hole of the Setting-screw, lay on upon the dark Part of _Fig._\r\n8. one of the Pastboard-sides; and from the black Line _p q_, draw a\r\nLine coincident to it as on the Brass, for making the half Hole A by;\r\nand the other Half of it on the opposite Half-side.\r\n\r\nThese Pastboards will be very useful to the Whitesmith, for directing\r\nhim to find the Places where the Holes for the Axis of the Tongue, and\r\nthose for screwing the Two Halves of the Mortise together, are to be\r\nmade. I advise against boring the great Hole with a Tool (a Bit) with\r\nmore than Four Edges; for it would be apt to tear the Brass.\r\n\r\nThe great Hole of the Turnep-drill is bored with Tools like those\r\nwherewith a Gun is bored. But the Wheat-drill is bored with a\r\nScrew-stock, whose Edges are made sharp for that Purpose, and may be\r\nset wider or narrower at Pleasure: It is put into the Hole along with\r\nan half-round Piece of Wood, the lower End of the Stock being set fast\r\nin a Vice: The whole Seed-box (for it must always be screwed together\r\nbefore it is bored), being put on the End of the Stock (made taper a\r\nlittle way for entering), is turned round it by a long wooden Spanner,\r\nwhich hath a Notch in the middle of it, to receive the whole Seed-box,\r\nin order to bore it by turning it round upon the Stock.\r\n\r\nThe Brass ought to be of the best Sort, which will be easy to file, and\r\nyet not mix with baser Metal.\r\n\r\nThe Seed-boxes may be cast whole by these Moulds; but I prefer those\r\nthat are screwed together, for several Reasons, which I have not time\r\nnow to write.\r\n\r\nThere is a Turnep Seed-box come to my Hands that was made by\r\nPretenders; I wish it is the only one made in the same manner; for\r\nit is useless; the Notches in the Spindle are much shorter than the\r\nBreadth of the Mortise; at each End of the Notches is a deep Chanel (as\r\ndeep as the Bottom of the Notches) quite round the Spindle, instead\r\nof a Mark, which should be but just visible for cutting the Notches;\r\nand instead of a tender Steel Spring, there is a strong Piece of Iron\r\nwithout Elasticity. By means of this Iron, the Machine grinds the Seed,\r\ninstead of drilling it.\r\n\r\nWhat I shall here add concerning the Wheat-drill, is some Alterations\r\nin _Fig._ 21. of _Plate_ 4. _viz._ The fore Share and Sheat must be\r\nleft out for drilling Wheat, up more middle Rows being used. And the\r\nTwo Beams B B in the Plough, _Fig._ 1. must be set to make Chanels Ten\r\nInches asunder. And the double Hopper, _Fig._ 15. must be set nearer\r\ntogether, so as the Seed may fall into the middle of the Funnels of the\r\nBeams.\r\n\r\nTho’ there is no Necessity of Marking-wheels for guiding the\r\nDrill-horse upon Ridges; yet they are very useful for holding the Drill\r\nsteady, and to prevent its tottering, which without the Marking-wheels,\r\nand the fore Hopper, it is apt to do, when the Shares stand so near\r\ntogether as Ten Inches; and on a narrow Ridge one of the hinder Wheels\r\nmight run off to the Furrow, and draw the Shares after it, if the Drill\r\nwere not kept steady by the Marking-wheels, and by their Hopper, which\r\ntakes hold of the single Standard by _Fig._ 22. as is seen in _Fig._\r\n21. in _Plate_ 4. But there should not be so much room in it on each\r\nSide of the Standard, left the Plough by that means should have too\r\nmuch room to totter, now the Shares are so near together.\r\n\r\nThe Marking-wheels must be set at the Distance of the Breadth of Two\r\nRidges, which, as we now make them, is about Nine Feet and an half from\r\nWheel to Wheel.\r\n\r\nThe Brass Box may be taken out of the fore Hopper: And tho’ that\r\nHopper be of no Use to the double Row, except as is abovesaid; yet if\r\nthere should be Occasion to press the Marking-wheels deeper into the\r\nGround for keeping the Plough the more steady in its Course, it may\r\nbe usefully filled with Earth, or other Matter, sufficient for that\r\nPurpose. And besides, it may serve to plant Three Rows of St. Foin,\r\nwhen the fore Share and Sheat are put in, and the Beams and hinder\r\nHopper set a Foot or Eighteen Inches wider, and the Marking-wheels at\r\ntheir due Distance, as is directed in the Essay. Thus the same Drill\r\nmay plant Wheat and St. Foin.\r\n\r\nA Drill for the double Rows might be made with a single hinder Hopper,\r\ninstead of the double one. And there is a Contrivance to supply the Use\r\nof the fore Hopper for keeping the Plough steady, and more easy to make\r\nthan that Hopper; but this cannot be described by Words without Cuts.\r\n\r\nThe Lime wherewith the brined Wheat is dried, receiving some of the\r\nSalts from the Brine, will stick in the Notches of the Spindle; yet\r\nnever makes any Stoppage to their Delivery of the Seed; but every Year\r\nwe clean the Notches from the Lime with a Chissel, and, if it were done\r\noftener, it would not be amiss.\r\n\r\nThere is an Accident that may possibly happen, but never to a careful\r\nDriller; _viz._ a large Clod may some way be thrown into a Funnel\r\nof the Beam of the Plough, either by a Wheel, or by the Paddle that\r\ncleanses the Sheats from the Dirt that sticks to them when the Earth is\r\nwet. This may stop the Wheat from falling out of the Funnel into the\r\nTrunk; and then, so far as the Plough, goes thus stopped, the Chanel\r\nwill have no Seed in it; but the Driller that follows may take it out\r\nimmediately, which if he should neglect to do for never so little a\r\nDistance, he ought to stop the Plough whilst he supplies the Chanel\r\nwith Seed from his Hand as far as it is empty. When there is any Danger\r\nof this, as in very rough cloddy Ground, it is best to take off the\r\nDrill-harrow, to the end that the Chanel may lie open for receiving\r\nthe Seed from the Hand. But if the Ends of the Hopper reach below the\r\nFunnels, and they are otherwise defended, as they may be, this Accident\r\ncan never happen.\r\n\r\nWhen the Drill-harrow is taken off, the best way for taking up the\r\nPlough to turn it, is to bore a Hole of about half an Inch Diameter in\r\nthe End of each Beam behind the Funnels, and fasten a Withe into these\r\nHoles; by which Withe the Driller very conveniently takes hold with\r\none Hand, and lifts up the Plough, laying his other Hand on the Hopper\r\nto keep it steady. This Method of taking up the Plough hath been often\r\nused for the Wheat-drill, and for the Turnep-drill; and in the latter\r\nthe Hole in the one Beam holds the Withe as well as do the Two Holes in\r\nthe former.\r\n\r\nThere are new Editions of some of these Engines, which cannot be fully\r\ndescribed without more _Plates_; but since those already described\r\nare found by Experience to be sufficient for the Purposes they were\r\ndesigned for, new Editions of them are not necessary, tho’ convenient\r\nin many respects.\r\n\r\nReason will easily make Additions to the Instruments when they are\r\nnecessary; as when more than one Brass Spindle is to be turned by one\r\nor each Wheel for planting Clover amongst Barley after it is come up.\r\n’Tis done by a very light Plough, drawn by a Man: It plants Four Rows\r\nat once Eight Inches asunder: The Shares are very short and narrow, and\r\nso are the Sheats and Trunks. ’Tis not difficult to put on a Crank at\r\nthe other End of the Brass Spindle, in the same manner that the Handle\r\nthat winds up a Jack is put on, and to fasten it at the Hole at I in\r\n_Fig._ 5. of _Plate_ 2. This Crank must, at its first turning, before\r\nit turns up towards the Letter H, of the same _Fig._ be long enough to\r\nreach to within an Inch of the Fork of the Second Spindle. Thus each\r\nWheel may turn several Spindles, and then this Drill may plant many\r\nRows of Seeds at once.\r\n\r\nWhen you plant Rows nearer together than Eight Inches, it is best that\r\nthe Plough have Two Ranks of Shares and Hoppers, else the Earth may be\r\ndriven before the Shares; but with Two Racks of them, they will not be\r\nmore apt to drive the Earth before them in making Rows at Four Inches\r\nasunder, than at Eight, when there is only a single Rank of Shares.\r\n\r\nBut I think this near Distance of Four Inches cannot be proper for any\r\nSort of Seeds, except Flax-seed; and even for that Seed not necessary.\r\nIf the Land be made fine, a single Rank of Shares will go very well to\r\nplant Rows at Seven Inches asunder.\r\n\r\nI had formerly a Drill-Plough for drilling across very high round\r\nRidges for Hand-hoeing, where Horse-hoeing is impracticable: It had\r\nno Limbers; but it had little Ground-wrists to make open Chanels, and\r\nhad Handles behind it, whereby the Driller raised up the Tail of the\r\nPlough, when it was passing the Summit of the Ridge. There were neither\r\nFunnels nor Trunks; for these would hinder the Seed from falling into\r\nthe Chanels, both by the Plough’s going up and down the Ridge. The\r\nHopper was drawn by the Plough in such a manner, that in passing all\r\nParts of the Ridge the Wheels were not raised from the Ground: The\r\nChanels were equally supplied with Seed throughout: It planted Four\r\nRows at once, at a Foot asunder. I used this Drill-Plough 30 Years ago\r\nin _Oxfordshire_: I have no such Ridges here, nor consequently any\r\nOccasion of such an Instrument; and did not make Cuts of it, because it\r\nis not useful for Horse-hoeing. I only mention it here for the Benefit\r\nof those who have a mind to plant such Ridges regularly with an Engine:\r\nI hope their own Reason will enable them to contrive such a Plough,\r\nespecially now they have the manner of making the Drill, Hopper, _&c._\r\nshewn to them.\r\n\r\nI have made a very material Addition to the Hoe-Plough, of _Plate_ 6.\r\n_viz._ At the fore End of the Beam _Fig._ 2. is the Hole I, by which\r\nalone let the Plough be drawn, leaving out the Hole H; instead of the\r\nHole G make a Mortise, Three or Four Inches long, and as broad as the\r\nThickness of the Iron Pin, the End and Nut of which are seen at C,\r\nin _Fig._ 1. This Pin should be more than half an Inch Diameter, and\r\nsquare at that End that goes into the Mortise; let the hinder End of\r\nthe Mortise just appear behind the Plank, when the Beam is at right\r\nAngles with it.\r\n\r\nBy means of this Mortise there may be many more Holes through the Plank\r\nwithout Danger of splitting into one another the Holes in the Beam,\r\nwhich must answer those in the Plank.\r\n\r\nDraw many Lines from the Middle of the foremost Hole of the Plank to\r\nthe hinder Edge of it, at (suppose) a quarter of an Inch from one\r\nanother there; and then bore a Hole in that Part of each Line that is\r\nleast apt to break into the next Hole to it.\r\n\r\nEvery System of Holes in the Plank will have like Benefit of being\r\nincreased in their Number by the Convenience of this Mortise; without\r\nwhich it is impossible to have so great Variety of turning the Point of\r\nthe Share to make the Share go parallel to the Horse-path.\r\n\r\nThe Board described in _p._ 403. we now use very seldom in Hoeing of\r\nWheat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Explanation of Plate_ VII.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 1. shews the Plank and the Harrow of the latest and best\r\nDrill-plough, most simple, and accommodated to the present Practice of\r\nplanting double Rows.\r\n\r\nA is the Plank, with all its Mortises and Holes; _b_ is the Mortise\r\ninto which the Tenon of the fore Sheat of the Drill-plough, for\r\nplanting treble Rows, was fastened; _d_ is the square Hole for\r\nreceiving the Seed from a Hole of the same Shape and Size in the Bottom\r\nof the Funnel.\r\n\r\nWhen the Sheat is taken out of the Mortise _b_, and another Sheat is\r\nmade exactly the same with that, place them in the Mortises _a a_, and\r\nmake the Two square Holes _c c_ behind them, for their Funnels to\r\nstand on. Make the Mortise _e_, which is to hold the single Standard\r\nthat is to hold up the fore Hopper in the treble Drill, and in this to\r\nguide the Wheels also, instead of Wreaths, that in the treble Drill are\r\nput on the Spindle bearing against the Insides of the double Standards;\r\nfor in this the Shares being but Ten Inches asunder, and at such a\r\nDistance from each of the Wheels, that neither of them doth by rising\r\nlift up a Share perceptibly; but if the Shares were wide asunder, or\r\nthere were more of them reaching nearer to the Ends of the Plank, a\r\nWheel might rise up, and lift a Share out of the Ground, if guided by\r\nthe single Standard and Hopper, as in this. The single Standard is\r\nshewn in _Plate_ 4. _Fig._ 10. but this has no Fork at its Bottom,\r\nas that has. This has only a single Tenon, and is shouldered before,\r\nbehind, and on each Side, to hold it the more firm and steady, when\r\ntightly pinned down by Two Pins underneath the Plank. The Dimensions of\r\nthis Standard are the same with those of the other; but the Shoulders\r\nmust not increase the Thickness of the Standard any higher than the\r\nTops of the Funnels.\r\n\r\nThe Four other square Holes, _viz._ _f_ with another behind it, and _g_\r\nwith one before it, are for the double Standards, which are to be well\r\nshouldered, or braced on the Side of each that is next to the End of\r\nthe Plank, and on the Outside. There is no need of Shoulder or Brace\r\non the Sides where the Spindle is placed, or on the Side next to the\r\nMiddle of the Plank.\r\n\r\nThe Four round Holes _h i k l_ are those thro’ which the Four Pins pass\r\nthat hold on the Limbers, and the Piece A, in _Fig._ 2. and the other\r\nof the same Sort in _Fig._ 4.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 2. and 4. shew how the Harrow’s Leg B is held to the Piece A, by\r\nthe Pin C. The Letters _a b_ shew the Holes through which the Pins do\r\npass to screw the Piece A up to the Plank, and the Limbers for guiding\r\nthe Harrow. This Piece A is somewhat longer than the Breadth of the\r\nPlank; it is about Two Inches thick, and Two and an half in Depth. The\r\nPin _Fig._ 3. goes through this Piece near the Bottom of its fore End,\r\nwhereby the Harrow tines have the more room to rise up, without being\r\nheld down by the Legs pressing against the Plank.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 3. is the Pin C, of _Fig._ 2. _a_ is its Head, _b_ its round\r\nPart, whereon the Harrow moves; _c_ is its square Part, that prevents\r\nits turning, which by the Motion of the Harrow would unscrew the Nut\r\n_d_, and cause it to come off of the Screw _e_, and be lost.\r\n\r\nThe Harrow is also shewn in _Fig._ 1. as it is guided by the Pieces\r\nbefore described: B is its Head, that holds the Tines D D, drawn by\r\nthe Legs C C. Tho’ these Legs _in Plano_ seem in their Middle to\r\ncrook sideways, yet when out of Perspective, their Middles crook only\r\ndownwards; which is to give the greater Length to the Tines, and the\r\nmore room for them to move up.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 5. is the Spindle in Three Parts. A is the middle Part, wherein\r\nare the Notches _b b_. This is best to be of Oak, or some other hard\r\nWood, in which the Edges of the Notches are less apt to wear than in\r\nsofter Wood; but I have had a Set that have lasted the Drilling of\r\n120 Acres, when made of Ash. B and C are the Two other Parts: D and\r\nE are their Ends, whereon the Wheels are put. The Holes _h h_ _h h_,\r\nand the same in the other End under the Letter E, are for setting\r\nthe Wheels at different Distances, in order for making new Notches,\r\nor for different-sized Ridges: The Wheels are held in their Places\r\nby long Nails put through some of these Holes, and clenched upon the\r\nIron Stock-bonds to prevent their falling out. These Ends B and C need\r\nnot be cut to a Square; except just enough to prevent the Wheels from\r\nturning on the Spindle.\r\n\r\nThese Three Parts are grafted together by Help of the hollow Cylinder\r\n_Fig._ 6. which, being put on upon the Joint _f_, of the Spindle _Fig._\r\n5. holds the Parts A and B together by the Two Pins _a a_, passing\r\nthrough the Cylinder near its Ends, and through the Holes _k_ and _g_.\r\n\r\nThis Joint may be in another manner; _viz._ One Part of the Spindle may\r\nenter into the other by cutting it to a square Peg of an Inch long, and\r\n³⁄₄ths Diameter, entering an Hole that fits it, at the End of the other\r\nPart.\r\n\r\nThese Pins will be best to have Screws at their Ends with Nuts to\r\nthem; and then they need not be so tight in the Holes, and may be the\r\nmore easily taken out, when the Part B is to be taken off for avoiding\r\nObstructions in drilling an outside Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe Cylinder is a Foot long, and about half an Inch thick, bound with\r\nan Iron Ferrel at each End; and if there were another in the Middle, it\r\nmight be the stronger.\r\n\r\nPlace the Cylinder on the Outside of the Spindle, the Joint _f_ being\r\nexactly against the Middle of the Cylinder; and mark at each End of it,\r\nin order to see when it is in its right Place; and after it is put on\r\nand pinned, mark likewise on the Spindle the exact Places of the Holes,\r\nfor the more easy finding them every Time the Cylinder is put on.\r\n\r\nAnother Cylinder must be on the Joint _c_, held together by Pins\r\npassing thro’ the Holes _i_ and _d_, in the same manner, and for the\r\nsame Purpose, as the other Joint already described.\r\n\r\nThe Spindle ought to be of equal Diameter with the Bore of the\r\nSeed-boxes, thro’ which it is to pass; but this I find, needs not be\r\nquite an Inch and ³⁄₄ths; it may want an 8th of it, even in this long\r\nSpindle.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 7. is one of the Pins which hold the Cylinder in its Place, as\r\nhas been said; _a_ is its Head; _b_ the Stalk, which would be better\r\nto be a Screw at its lower End, whereon to screw a Nut; but then the\r\nStalk must be square at the Head.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 8. is a Sheat with its Trunk and Share of the Drill-plough,\r\nwhich has been described in _Plates_ 4. and 5. but the Shape of the\r\nShare, as it rises at the Socket, is more plainly seen in this Figure.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 9. is the whole Wheat-drill, which at present I use for planting\r\nthe double Row. A is the Hopper, rising and sinking on the single\r\nStandard B, which holds it up. C is the thing like the Carrier of a\r\nLatch, described by _Fig._ 22. in _Plate_ 4. I need say no more for\r\ndescribing this Drill, than to shew how it differs from that described\r\nin _Plate_ 4. _viz._ This Hopper has Two of these Carriers, the one\r\nnear its Top, like the other; and another near its Bottom, which keeps\r\nthe Plough from rising at either End, without the rising of either End\r\nof the Hopper, which is no Inconvenience here; because the Two Shares,\r\nbeing but Ten Inches asunder, are almost the same as one; so that at\r\nthe Distance the Wheels stand from each other, the rising of one Wheel\r\ndoth not lift up the Share that is next to it perceptibly; as it would\r\ndo if the Shares were farther asunder, or the Wheels nearer together.\r\n\r\nThis Hopper holds twice as much Seed as the single fore Hopper did,\r\n_viz._ half a Bushel; and is divided into Two equal Parts by the\r\nPartition _e_, whereby the Driller sees whether the Seed is discharged\r\nequally; and if he perceives that one Part of the Hopper runs out\r\nfaster than the other, he must adjust them by the Setting-screws.\r\n\r\nThe Funnels _a a_, which receive the Seed from the Hopper, and convey\r\nit down into the Trunks _c c_, appear under the Hopper, as doth also\r\nPart of the Hole _d_, whereon the Funnel stood when the fore Hopper\r\nwas single. D shews the Cylinder upon the grafted Spindle at one End,\r\nas F shews where the other End with its Cylinder and Wheel is taken\r\noff. The Ends of the Piece A, which guide the Harrow, appear behind\r\nthe Plank at _f f_. At _g_ in the Harrow-head is a Hole exactly in\r\nthe Middle between the Tines, for tying on a Stone when the Harrow is\r\ntoo light for the Soil. _Note_, This Hole must follow exactly after\r\nthe Middle of the Plank, _i. e._ between the Two Shares at an equal\r\nDistance from each.\r\n\r\nObserve, that the Legs of this Harrow go thro’ the Head on the Outsides\r\nof the Tines, as in the treble Drill they go thro’ on the Inside of the\r\nTines. Instead of the wooden Tines, may be put in common Iron Tines of\r\na proper Length.\r\n\r\nThe Two Hooks whereby the Plough is drawn are at _h h_. ’Tis best\r\nfor the Ends of the Hooks to turn upwards, so that the Links of the\r\nChain-traces, that are to be put on them, may not be apt to drop off.\r\nTake care that these Traces be of an equal Length, which may be easily\r\nmade even by the Links that are put on these Hooks.\r\n\r\n_Note_, The Links of the Piece of Chain, whereby the Plough is made\r\nto go deeper or shallower, may be very small, and by no means in the\r\nProportion they bear to the Limbers in the Cut. There need not be above\r\nFour or Five Links. If there be occasion to raise or sink the Limbers\r\nmore than that Number will reach, the Cord may be tied longer or\r\nshorter on the other Limber. And when there is not the Convenience of\r\nChain-traces, they may be supplied by a few Iron Links at the Ends of\r\nHempen Traces.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 10. is the Shape of a wooden Wreath, which (when the Shares\r\nstand wider asunder, or when there are more than Two of them, so that\r\nthey come nearer to the Ends of the Plank, this Wreath) is necessary to\r\nbe put on the Spindle, the End _a_ bearing against the Inside of the\r\ndouble Standards, and the End _b_ being towards the Hopper. ’Tis fixt\r\nto the Spindle by the Screw _c_, which should not enter the Spindle\r\nabove half an Inch deep. There may be another like Screw to enter in\r\nthe same manner on the opposite Side of this Wreath. There must be in\r\nthis case another Wreath the same of this to bear against the other\r\ndouble Standards. And when these Wreaths are used, the Hopper must have\r\nonly the upper Carrier C; the lower one must be taken off. But in this\r\nour Drill for planting Wheat, no Wreaths must be on the Spindle, except\r\nthose at _b b_, which are to hold the Hopper from moving endways. And\r\nthese may be of the Sort above described, the End _a_ bearing against\r\nthe Hopper.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 11. is the Beam of the Hoe-plough described in _Plate_ VI.\r\n_Fig._ 2. with no other Alteration than leaving out the Hole H, and the\r\npricked Line between it and the Hole I; and changing the Hole G into\r\na Mortise. The pricked Line _a b_ represents the hinder Edge of the\r\nPlank, behind which appears a very small Part of a Mortise. See _p._\r\n415, 416.\r\n\r\n_Fig._ 12. is the Plank, which is _Fig._ 3. in _Plate_ VI. The\r\nImprovement of it in this Figure is described in _p._ 415, 416.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An_ Appendix _to Chap._ IX. _of_ Wheat, _p._ 138. _containing_\r\nMemoranda _for the Practisers of this_ Husbandry.\r\n\r\nAt the Second Hoeing the Plough goes in the Furrow of the First,\r\nmaking it deeper, and nearer to the Wheat. The Third Hoeing fills up\r\nthis Furrow; and then, at the Fourth Hoeing, the Plough goes in the\r\nsame Place as the Second, turning the Mould into the Interval. ’Tis\r\nremarkable that though the Furrows of the Second and Fourth Hoeings\r\nbe deep, and near to the Rows, seeming to deprive the Wheat of the\r\nMould which should nourish it, whereby one would imagine, that these\r\nFurrows lying long open should weaken or starve it; yet it is just the\r\ncontrary; for it grows the more vigorous: And it is the Observation\r\nof my Ploughmen, that they cannot at these Hoeings go too near to the\r\nRows, unless the Plough should tear out the Plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Plate 7._\r\n\r\n_P. 422_\r\n\r\n_Invented & Designed by & Printed for JETHRO TULL ESQ Oct: the 25^{th}\r\n1738]\r\n\r\nIf I may presume to assign the Cause of this surprising Effect, it is,\r\nin my Opinion, the following; _viz._ This open Furrow has a double\r\nSurface of Earth, which by the _Nitre_ of the contiguous _Atmosphere_,\r\nis pulverized to a great Degree of Minuteness near the Row. The Roots\r\nthat the Plough cuts off on the perpendicular Side of the Furrow, send\r\nout new Fibres to receive the _Pabulum_ from this new-made Pasture;\r\nand also Part of this superfine Powder is continually falling down\r\ninto the Bottom of the Furrow, and there gives a very quick Growth to\r\nthose Roots that are next it, and a quick Passage through it into the\r\nEarth of the Interval, where they take likewise the Benefit of the\r\nother Side of this pulverized Furrow. When it is said, that Air kills\r\nRoots, it must not be understood, that it kills a Plant, unless all, or\r\nalmost all, its Root is exposed to it, as it is not in this Case. Some\r\nthink there are Roots that run horizontally below the Plough into the\r\nInterval; but of this I am not convinced.\r\n\r\n’Tis not often that we hoe above Four times; and then the Furrow is\r\nturned towards the Row at the Third time only.\r\n\r\nThere being no Danger from these Furrows lying long open, we are not\r\nconfined to any precise Distance between the times of Hoeing, for which\r\nwe need only regard the Weather, the Weeds, and our own Convenience of\r\nOpportunity and Leisure.\r\n\r\n’Tis an Advantage when these Furrows lie open on each Side of the\r\ndouble Row till Harvest; for then there need only Two Furrows to be\r\nplowed on a Ridge to throw down the Partition in order for planting the\r\nnext Crop; but if at the last Hoeing the Furrows are turned towards\r\nthe Row, they must be plowed back again after Harvest before the\r\nPartition can be plowed: This requires double the time of the other;\r\nand the sooner the Partitions are plowed, the more time they will have\r\nto be pulverized before they are replanted. Indeed this Advantage is\r\nonly when the Rows are to be planted where they were the Year before;\r\nfor this is rather a Disadvantage when they are to be planted in the\r\nIntervals. Whether these Furrows lying long open next the Rows in very\r\nhot dry Climates may be prejudicial, cannot be known, but by Trials.\r\n\r\nAs from the external Superficies of an Acre of Pasture on a rich\r\nSoil, Animals take more _Pabulum_ than of an Acre on a poor Soil; so\r\nVegetables take more _Pabulum_ from the internal Superficies of a rich\r\nAcre than of a poor one; the Pulveration, or Superficies of Parts,\r\nbeing equal. _See_ p. 44, 45. From whence there is no Encouragement for\r\nmaking Trials on very poor Land.\r\n\r\n’Tis no great Matter whether the Rows are drilled on the Partitions,\r\nor the Intervals; for the Crops of a Field, Four Years successively\r\ndrilled on the Partitions, were very good. After the Partitions had\r\nbeen plowed, and lain open till the Weather made them pulverizable by\r\nthe Harrows, and then turned together by Furrows larger than those\r\nwhich opened them, much Earth of the Intervals was mixed with them.\r\nThis is the strongest and lowest Ground I have; and if there should be\r\nmuch wet Weather after Harvest, it is so long in drying, that we take\r\nthe first Opportunity the Weather allows for planting the Wheat, which\r\nis generally done in the above manner, because it is the shortest; but,\r\nwithout some such Reason to the contrary, I prefer planting the Rows on\r\nthe precedent Intervals.\r\n\r\nMy Field, whereon is now the Thirteenth Crop of Wheat, has shewn that\r\nthe Rows may successfully stand upon any Part of the Ground. The Ridges\r\nof this Field were for the Twelfth Crop, changed from Six Feet to Four\r\nFeet Six Inches: In order for this Alteration, the Ridges were plowed\r\ndown, and the whole Field was plowed cross-ways of the Ridges for\r\nmaking them level; and then the next Ridges were laid out the same way\r\nas the former, but One Foot Four Inches narrower; and the double Rows\r\ndrilled on their Tops, whereby of consequence there must be some Rows\r\nstanding on every Part of the Ground, both on the former Partitions,\r\nand on every Part of the Intervals: Notwithstanding this, there was no\r\nmanner of Difference in the Goodness of the Rows, and the whole Field\r\nwas in every Part of it equal, and the best, I believe, that ever grew\r\non it. It has now the Thirteenth Crop, likely to be very good, tho’ the\r\nLand was not plowed cross-ways.\r\n\r\nThe proper Times for Plowings and Hoeings depending upon the Weather,\r\nand other Circumstances, cannot be directed but by the Reason and\r\nExperience of the Practiser, as has been said.\r\n\r\nThe Number of Ridges being increased, as their Breadth is now\r\ndiminished, occasions somewhat the more Plough-work, we likewise use\r\nmore Handwork than formerly; but the Profit of this increased Labour is\r\nmore than double to the Expence of it.\r\n\r\nThe Decline of the Woolen Manufacture furnishes us at this time with\r\nPlenty of Hand-hoers and Weeders; because they can earn much more by\r\nworking in the Field than by Spinning at home.\r\n\r\n’Tis better to make Fifteen Ridges on an Acre, than to leave any Earth\r\nunmoved by the Hoe-plough in the Middle of the Intervals; but when\r\nPloughmen, by Practice, understand well to use the Hoe-plough, they\r\nwill plow the Intervals clean, tho’ the Ridges are only Fourteen on an\r\nAcre.\r\n\r\nBearded Wheat is in this Country called _Cone_, and that which has no\r\nBeard _Lammas_. I observed formerly the Bread of _White-cone_ had a\r\nlittle yellowish Cast, which I now suspect was from the Mill-stones;\r\nfor I have seen it be very white these many Years, since the Millers\r\nknow better how to grind this Wheat. Cone wheat Westwards yields\r\nSix-pence a Bushel more than _Lammas_; but towards _London_ the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nThe Reasons why a whole Field of Wheat doth not produce a Crop equal in\r\nproportion to a Yard or Perch cut, rubbed out, and weighed immediately\r\nupon the Spot, may be, because the Grain of the Field lying to sweat\r\nin the Mow, loses considerably of its Weight and Measure. There is\r\nalso some lost in the Field by Reapers, and by Leasers; and some is by\r\nThreshers thrown out of the Barn; and some of them are found to have\r\nContrivances to carry home with them at Night, Part of the Wheat they\r\nthresh in the Day. I say nothing of those Thieves, who in Harvest rob\r\nthe Field in the Dark; tho’ they are not very uncommon.\r\n\r\nI missed of making my proposed Experiment of the single Row, after I\r\nhad prepared for it by plowing out one of the double in several Places\r\nfor that Purpose; but, in the Hurry of Harvest, they were cut together\r\nwith the rest, without making any Trial; as should have been made, if\r\nmy Illness had not prevented my Attendance in the Field at the time of\r\nReaping.\r\n\r\nThe Practice and Instruments that are left off for better in their\r\nroom, as the Quadruple and Treble Rows, _&c._ are still useful to be\r\nshewn, in order to deter others from going into an inferior Method that\r\nis now exploded; for some might think it an Improvement of the double\r\nRows, _&c._ by their own Invention, if they should not know it had been\r\nalready tried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Artificial_ Pasture of Plants exceeds
