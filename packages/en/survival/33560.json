H. Lane, C. W. Hibbard and W. K. McNown collected\r\nthe specimens that Hibbard (1933) described and made the basis of two\r\nnew species. These were from the Rock Lake shale member of the Stanton\r\nformation, six miles northwest of Garnett, Anderson County, Kansas. In\r\n1954, from a locality (KAn-1/D, see page 480) approximately one fourth\r\nmile southwest of the first locality, specimens were quarried by F. E.\r\nPeabody, R. W. Wilson and R. Weeks. In 1955 R. R. Camp collected\r\nadditional blocks of Rock Lake shale from this second locality. Study of\r\nall of the materials from the above mentioned localities reveals the\r\nexistence of an hitherto unrecognized genus of coelacanth. It is named\r\nand described below.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank Prof. Theodore H. Eaton, Jr., for suggesting the project\r\nand for much helpful advice. I am indebted to Dr. E. I. White of the\r\nBritish Museum (Natural History) for furnishing a cast of the\r\nendocranium of _Rhabdoderma elegans_ (Newberry) for comparison, and to\r\nDrs. Donald Baird (Princeton University), Bobb Schaeffer (American\r\nMuseum of Natural History) and R. H. Denison (Chicago Natural History\r\nMuseum) for loans and exchanges of specimens for comparison. I am\r\ngrateful to Dr. Bobb Schaeffer for advice on the manuscript. Mr. Merton\r\nC. Bowman assisted with the illustrations. The study here reported on\r\nwas made while I was a Research Assistant supported by National Science\r\nFoundation Grant G-14013.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYSTEMATIC DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nSubclass CROSSOPTERYGII\r\n\r\nSuperorder COELACANTHI\r\n\r\nOrder Coelacanthiformes\r\n\r\nSuborder DIPLOCERCIDOIDEI\r\n\r\nFamily DIPLOCERCIDAE\r\n\r\nSubfamily ~Rhabdodermatinae~, new subfamily\r\n\r\n     _Type genus._--_Rhabdoderma Reis_, 1888, Paleontographica,\r\n     vol. 35, p. 71.\r\n\r\n     _Referred genus._--_Synaptotylus_ new, described below.\r\n\r\n     _Horizon._--Carboniferous.\r\n\r\n     _Diagnosis._--Sphenethmoid region partly ossified, and\r\n     consisting of basisphenoid, parasphenoid, and ethmoid\r\n     ossifications; paired basipterygoid process and paired\r\n     antotic process on basisphenoid; parasphenoid of normal\r\n     size, and closely associated with, or fused to,\r\n     basisphenoid; ethmoids paired in _Rhabdoderma_ (unknown in\r\n     _Synaptotylus_).\r\n\r\n_Discussion._--Because of the great differences in endocranial structure\r\nbetween the Devonian and Pennsylvanian coelacanths, they are here placed\r\nin new subfamilies. The two proposed subfamilies of the family\r\nDiplocercidae are the Diplocercinae and the Rhabdodermatinae. The\r\nDiplocercinae include those coelacanths having two large unpaired bones\r\nin the endocranium (at present this includes _Diplocercides_ Stensioe,\r\n_Nesides_ Stensioe and _Euporosteus_ Jaekel). The subfamily\r\nRhabdodermatinae is composed of coelacanths having reduced endocranial\r\nossification, as described in detail above, and now including\r\n_Rhabdoderma_ Reis and _Synaptotylus_ n. g.\r\n\r\nMembers of this subfamily differ from those of the subfamily\r\nDiplocercinae in having several paired and unpaired elements in the\r\nsphenethmoid region of the endocranium, instead of only one larger\r\nossification. They differ from those of the suborder Coelacanthoidei in\r\nthe retention of basipterygoid processes.\r\n\r\n_Synaptotylus_ is more closely related to _Rhabdoderma_ than to the\r\nDiplocercines because the anterior portion of the endocranium contains\r\nonly a basisphenoid, parasphenoid, and probably ethmoids. The\r\nsphenethmoid region was certainly not a large, unpaired unit as in the\r\nDiplocercines. Probably the posterior part, the otico-occipital region\r\n(not known in _Synaptotylus_), was much more nearly like that of\r\n_Rhabdoderma_, which consisted of unpaired basioccipital and\r\nsupraoccipital, and paired prootics, exoccipitals, and anterior and\r\nposterior occipital ossifications (Moy-Thomas, 1937: figs. 3, 4).\r\nMoy-Thomas (1937:389) points out that in _Rhabdoderma_ the occipital\r\nregion is \"considerably more ossified\" than in any coelacanths other\r\nthan the Devonian forms. Berg (1940:390) thought that the Carboniferous\r\ncoelacanths should be placed in a separate family because they did not\r\nhave two large, unpaired bones in the endocranium. _Rhabdoderma_ and\r\n_Synaptotylus_ represent another stage in evolution of the endocranium\r\nin coelacanths, and, if classification is to be based on endocranial\r\nstructure, then this stage (represented by the two genera) may later be\r\ngiven family rank as Berg suggested. Because _Rhabdoderma_ and\r\n_Synaptotylus_ have only part of the sphenethmoid region ossified and\r\nbecause they retain basipterygoid processes, they are considered to be\r\nrelated and are included in the subfamily Rhabdodermatinae.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Synaptotylus~, new genus\r\n\r\n     _Type species._--_Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard).\r\n\r\n     _Horizon._--Rock Lake shale member, Stanton formation,\r\n     Lansing group, Missouri series, Upper Pennsylvanian.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--Late Pennsylvanian fishes of small size, having the\r\nfollowing combination of characters: on basisphenoid, knoblike antotic\r\nprocesses connected by a low ridge to basipterygoid processes; entire\r\nventral surface of parasphenoid toothed; anterior margin of parasphenoid\r\nnotched and no evidence of hypophyseal opening. Dermal bones of skull\r\nsmooth or with low, rounded tubercles and striae; fronto-ethmoid shield\r\nincompletely known but having one pair of large rectangular frontals\r\nwith posterolaterally slanting anterior margins; intertemporals large,\r\nthe lateral margins curving laterally; postorbital triangular, apex\r\ndownward; subopercular somewhat triangular; squamosal carrying sensory\r\ncanal that curves down posteriorly and extends onto a ventral\r\nprojection; opercular generally triangular; supratemporals elongate,\r\ncurving to fit lateral margin of intertemporals; circumorbital plates\r\nlightly ossified. Palatoquadrate complex consisting of endopterygoid and\r\nectopterygoid (both toothed on medial surface), quadrate, and\r\nmetapterygoid, the latter smooth and having widened border for\r\narticulation on anterodorsal margin. Pectoral girdle consisting of\r\ncleithrum and clavicle (supracleithrum not seen); small projection on\r\nmedial surface of posterior portion of cleithrum; horizontal medial\r\nprocess on clavicle. Pelvic plate bearing three anteriorly diverging\r\napophyses, and one denticulate ventromedian process for articulation to\r\nopposite plate. Lepidotrichia jointed distally, but not tuberculated.\r\nScales oval, having posteriorly converging ridges on posterior exposed\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe name refers to the most distinctive character of the genus, the\r\nconnected antotic and basipterygoid processes on the basisphenoid, and\r\nis derived from Greek, _synaptos_--joined, _tylos_ (masc.)--knob,\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\n_Synaptotylus_ is excluded from the advanced suborder Coelacanthoidei by\r\nthe retention of basipterygoid processes on the basisphenoid.\r\n_Synaptotylus_ differs from _Rhabdoderma_ in several characters of the\r\nbasisphenoid, the most important being: knoblike antotic processes\r\n(those of _Rhabdoderma_ are wider, more flattened and more dorsal in\r\nposition); small, lateral basipterygoid processes (in _Rhabdoderma_\r\nthese are larger and farther ventral in position).\r\n\r\n\r\n~Synaptotylus newelli~ (Hibbard)\r\n\r\n     _Coelacanthus newelli_ Hibbard, 1933, Univ.

The remainder were collected from\r\n     University of Kansas Museum of Natural History locality\r\n     KAn-1/D, a quarry in sec. 5, T.19S, R.19E. Both of these are\r\n     approximately six miles northwest of Garnett, Anderson\r\n     County, Kansas.\r\n\r\n     _Referred specimens._--K.

One specimen (the type, no.\r\n     786F) and half of another were nearly complete. Specimens\r\n     are found scattered throughout the Rock Lake shale (see p.\r\n     498).\r\n\r\n     _Morphology._--Terminology used for bones of the skull is\r\n     that of Moy-Thomas (1937) and Schaeffer (1952).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Endocranium and parasphenoid_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). Restoration of\r\nthe basisphenoid, based on K. U. no. 9939, x 5. A, lateral view, B,\r\nposterior view, C, ventral view.]\r\n\r\nThe basisphenoid (see fig. 1) has been observed in only one specimen (K.\r\nU. no. 9939) in posterodorsal and ventral views. The basisphenoid,\r\nalthough somewhat crushed, appears to be fused to the parasphenoid. Both\r\nantotic and basipterygoid processes are present, and are connected by a\r\nlow, rounded ridge. The antotic processes are large, bulbar projections.\r\nThese processes in _Rhabdoderma_ are wider and more flattened\r\n(Moy-Thomas, 1937:figs. 3, 4). The antotic processes are at mid-point on\r\nthe lateral surface, not dorsal as in _Rhabdoderma_, and both the\r\nprocesses and the ridge are directed anteroventrally. The basipterygoid\r\nprocesses are smaller, somewhat vertically elongated projections,\r\nsituated at the end of the low connecting ridge extending\r\nanteroventrally from the antotic processes, and are not basal as are\r\nthose of _Rhabdoderma_. The sphenoid condyles, seen in posterior view,\r\nissue from the dorsal margin of the notochordal socket. The margins of\r\nthe socket are rounded, and slope down evenly to the center. A slight\r\ndepression situated between and dorsal to the sphenoid condyles is\r\nsupposedly for the attachment of the intercranial ligament (Schaeffer\r\nand Gregory, 1961:fig. 1). The alisphenoids extend upward,\r\nanterodorsally from the region above the sphenoid condyles, and may\r\nconnect to ridges on the ventral surface of the frontals. The lateral\r\nlaminae are not preserved, and their extent is unknown.\r\n\r\nIn viewing the changes in the endocranium of Carboniferous and Permian\r\ncoelacanths, it would be well to consider the mechanical relationship of\r\nthe loss of the basipterygoid processes to the effect on swallowing\r\nprey. Evidently many of the coelacanths, _Latimeria_ for example, are\r\npredators (Smith, 1939:104); to such fishes a more efficient catching\r\nand swallowing mechanism would be an adaptive improvement. Stensioe\r\n(1932:fig. 14) presents a cross section of the ethmosphenoid moiety of\r\nthe endocranium of _Diplocercides kayseri_ (von Koenen) showing the\r\nmetapterygoid of the palatoquadrate loosely articulated to both the\r\nantotic and basipterygoid processes. According to Tchernavin (1948:137)\r\nand Schaeffer and Rosen (1961:190) the swallowing of large prey depends\r\non the ability of the fish to expand its oral cavity by allowing the\r\nposteroventral portion of the palatoquadrate and the posterior end of\r\nthe mandible to swing outward. Where the palatoquadrate articulates with\r\nthe basisphenoid at the antotic and basipterygoid processes, as in the\r\nDevonian coelacanths, it can not swing so far laterally as where it\r\narticulates with only the dorsal, antotic process. Perhaps the loss of\r\nthe basipterygoid articulation reflects the development of a more\r\nefficient mechanism for swallowing prey in these fishes. Schaeffer and\r\nRosen (1961:191, 193) show that in the evolution of the actinopterygians\r\nseveral changes improved the feeding mechanism: some of these changes\r\nare: (1) freeing of the maxilla from the cheek, giving a larger chamber\r\nfor the action of the adductor mandibulae; (2) development of a coronoid\r\nprocess on the mandible; and (3) increase in torque around the jaw\r\narticulation. In coelacanths, at least some comparable changes occurred,\r\nsuch as: (1) loss of the maxillary, thus increasing the size of the\r\nadductor chamber; (2) development of the coronoid bone, affording a\r\ngreater area for muscle attachment; (3) development of an arched dorsal\r\nmargin on the angular; (4) modification of the palatoquadrate complex,\r\nwith resultant loss of the basipterygoid processes. In _Synaptotylus_\r\nthe basipterygoid processes are small, not basally located, and perhaps\r\nnot functional. A more efficient feeding mechanism developed rapidly\r\nduring the Carboniferous and has remained almost unaltered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). Restoration of\r\nthe parasphenoid, based on K. U. nos. 9939, 11451, x 5. A, ventral view,\r\nB, dorsal view and cross sections.]\r\n\r\nThe parasphenoid (see fig. 2) is a shovel-shaped bone having a wide\r\nanterior portion and a narrower posterior portion of nearly uniform\r\nwidth. Most of the ventral surface is covered with minute granular\r\nteeth. The anterior margin is flared and curved posteromedially from the\r\nlateral margin to a median triangular projection. The lateral margins\r\ncurve smoothly from the greatest anterior width to the narrow central\r\nportion, where the margins become somewhat thickened and turned\r\ndorsally. Posterior to this the lateral margins are probably nearly\r\nstraight. The external surface of the anterior section is nearly flat\r\nand has a central depressed area the sides of which slope evenly to the\r\ncenter. The internal surface is smooth and centrally convex. Because of\r\nthe fragmentary nature of all four observed specimens, total length was\r\nnot measured but is estimated to be 15 to 20 mm. The opening of the\r\nhypophyseal canal was not present, possibly because of crushing.\r\nEthmoidal ossifications were not preserved in any of the specimens\r\nstudied. The parasphenoid differs from that of _Rhabdoderma elegans_\r\n(Newberry) in being more flared and widened anteriorly and more concave\r\ncentrally.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dermal bones of the skull_\r\n\r\nVarious portions of the cranial roof are preserved in several specimens\r\n(see fig. 3). For comparisons with _Rhabdoderma elegans_, see Moy-Thomas\r\n(1937:fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe premaxillaries and rostral elements are not preserved in any of the\r\nspecimens. Only one pair of relatively large frontals have been\r\nobserved; they are 5.5 to 9.0 mm. long and 2.0 to 3.5 mm. wide. These\r\nare nearly flat bones, with the greatest width posteriorly 0.1 to 1.0\r\nmm. wider than the anterior portion. The midline suture is straight, the\r\nlateral margins are nearly straight, the anterior margin slopes evenly\r\nposterolaterally, and the posterior margin is slightly convex to\r\nstraight. The anterior margin in _R. elegans_ is essentially straight.\r\nOrnamentation consists of sparse, unevenly spaced, coarse tubercles or\r\nshort striae. In one specimen both bones have small clusters of\r\ntubercles near the lateral margins and about 2.0 mm. from the posterior\r\nmargin. None of these bones has alisphenoids or ridges on the ventral\r\nsurface, as Stensioe (1921:65, 97) described for _Wimania_ and _Axelia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). Diagram of the\r\ndermal bones of the skull, in lateral view, based on K. U. nos. 788 and\r\n11432. x 2-1/2 approximately.]\r\n\r\nOnly six supraorbitals have been preserved (see fig. 3). These are\r\nnearly square, flat, thin bones lying nearly in place adjacent to a\r\nfrontal on K. U. no. 788. The smallest is anterior; the margins of all\r\nare nearly straight. The bones are unornamented. Each bears a pore of\r\nthe supraorbital line just below the midline. The supraorbitals of _R.\r\nelegans_ have a triangular outline and do not bear pores.\r\n\r\nIntertemporals (fig. 3) on several specimens vary from approximately 9.0\r\nto 15.0 mm. in length, 2.0 to 2.7 mm. in anterior width, and increase to\r\n4.5 to 8.0 mm. in maximum posterior width. The midline suture is\r\nstraight, the anterior margin is concave and the lateral margin proceeds\r\nlaterally in a concave curve to the widest portion. In _R. elegans_ only\r\nthe anterior half of the corresponding margin is concave. The posterior\r\nmargin is slightly rounded and slopes anteriorly toward the lateral\r\nmargin. Ornamentation is usually of randomly oriented tubercles and\r\nstriae, although striae are more common in the posterior third and may\r\nbe longitudinal, whereas tubercles occur mainly on the anterior section.\r\nNo evidence of sensory pores, as seen on the intertemporal of _R.\r\nelegans_, has been found.\r\n\r\nThe supratemporals were observed on only one specimen (K. U. no. 788),\r\n(fig. 3). Sutures were difficult to distinguish but the medial margin is\r\npresumed to curve to fit and to articulate with the lateral margins of\r\nthe intertemporals. Lateral margins are smoothly curved but the anterior\r\nand posterior margins were broken off. There appears to be no\r\nornamentation on this bone. The supratemporals are much more elongated\r\nand curving than those in _R. elegans_.\r\n\r\nThe cheek region is nearly complete in one specimen (K. U. no. 788), and\r\nscattered parts occur in a few others (see fig. 3). The lacrimojugal of\r\nno. 788 is elongate, with both ends curving dorsally. It differs from\r\nthe lacrimojugal in _R. elegans_, in which the anterior end extends\r\nanteriorly and is not curved dorsally. The posterior and anterior\r\nmargins are not preserved; the greatest height appears to be posterior.\r\nPores of the suborbital portion of the infraorbital sensory canal are\r\nseen on the dorsal surface of the bone. In _R. elegans_ the pores are on\r\nthe lateral surface. A section of the lacrimojugal on specimen no.\r\n11425, broken at both ends, shows a thin layer of bone perforated by the\r\npores and covering a groove for the canal within the dorsal margin of\r\nthe bone. Both specimens are unornamented.\r\n\r\nA nearly complete postorbital (fig. 3) on specimen no. 788 is nearly\r\ntriangular, with the apex ventral. The concave anterior margin bears\r\npores of the postorbital part of the infraorbital line. Ornamentation\r\nconsists of widely spaced, coarse tubercles.\r\n\r\nPart of one squamosal is preserved. It is somewhat triangular and its\r\napex is ventral. This bone is associated with the postorbital,\r\nsubopercular and lacrimojugal on no. 788. The preopercular sensory line\r\npasses down the curving ventral margin of this bone, and extends\r\nventrally onto a narrow projection. A low ridge, nearly vertical, passes\r\ndorsally from about mid-point of the canal to the dorsal portion. The\r\nanterior margin is nearly straight, the ventral margin is concave, and\r\nthe dorsal margin is convex dorsally but may be incomplete. Perhaps the\r\nsquamosal and preopercular are fused. The surface appears smooth; the\r\nview may be of the medial side. The squamosal of _R. elegans_ is nearly\r\ntriangular and notably different from that of _Synaptotylus newelli_.\r\n\r\nThe subopercular (fig. 3) shows closely spaced tubercles on the lateral\r\nsurface. The bone is an elongated, irregular triangle with the apex\r\npointing anterodorsally. The margins are incomplete, except for the\r\nconcave, curving anterior margin.\r\n\r\nNumerous operculars (fig. 3) occur in the suite of specimens, both\r\nisolated and nearly in place. Each is subtriangular; the apex of the\r\ntriangle is ventral. A slight convexity projects from the anterodorsal\r\nborder. The posterior margin is broadly but shallowly indented.\r\nOtherwise the margins are smooth. Maximum height ranges from 8.0 to 11.0\r\nmm., and maximum width from 8.0 to 13.0 mm. Ornamentation varies from a\r\nfew widely spaced, randomly oriented tubercles to closely spaced\r\ntubercles merging posteriorly into striae. On some specimens these are\r\nparallel to the dorsal border, and oblique in the central portion. On\r\nthe posterior margins of several operculars the striae break up into\r\ntubercles. A few operculars have closely spaced tubercles over much of\r\nthe surface. The internal surface is smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Visceral skeleton_\r\n\r\nThe palatoquadrate complex, best seen on K. U. no. 9939 (fig. 4),\r\nconsists of endopterygoid, ectopterygoid, metapterygoid and quadrate. No\r\ntrace of epipterygoids, dermopalatines or autopalatines, such as\r\nMoy-Thomas (1937:392, fig. 5) described for _Rhabdoderma_, has been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe endopterygoid has a long, ventral, anteriorly-directed process, and\r\nan anterodorsal process that meets the metapterygoid in forming the\r\nprocessus ascendens. The suture between the endopterygoid and\r\nmetapterygoid, seen in lateral view, is distinct in some specimens and\r\nhas an associated ridge; these bones appear to be fused in others,\r\nwithout regard to size. This suture curves dorsally from a point\r\nanterior to the quadrate and passes anterodorsally to the extremity of\r\nthe processus ascendens. The suture is visible on the medial side only\r\nnear the processus ascendens, for it is covered by a dorsal, toothed\r\nextension of the endopterygoid. The endopterygoid has a smooth lateral\r\nsurface; the medial surface is covered with tiny granular teeth, in\r\ncharacteristic \"line and dot\" arrangement. The teeth extend onto the\r\nventral surface of the ventral process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). Restoration of\r\nthe palatoquadrate complex, based on K. U. no. 9939, x 5. A, medial\r\nview, B, lateral view.]\r\n\r\nTwo long, narrow, splintlike bones covered on one surface with granular\r\nteeth are interpreted as ectopterygoids. These are 13.0 and 16.0 mm.\r\nlong and each is 1.5 mm. wide. Orientation of these is unknown, but they\r\nprobably fitted against the ventral surface of the ventral process of\r\nthe endopterygoid (Moy-Thomas, 1937:fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). A, ceratohyal,\r\nlateral (?) view, based on K. U. nos. 11429 and 11457, x 5. B, urohyal,\r\nbased on K. U. no. 11457, x 5.]\r\n\r\nThe metapterygoid has a smooth surface in both views. The dorsal edge\r\nhas a thickened, flared margin that presumably articulated with the\r\nantotic process of the basisphenoid. No articular surface for the\r\nbasipterygoid process has been observed.\r\n\r\nThe quadrate is distinct and closely applied to the posteroventral\r\nmargin of the complex. In medial view the margin is nearly straight and\r\ncontinues to the ventral edge. The ventral surface is thickened and\r\nforms a rounded, knoblike articular surface. In lateral view the surface\r\nis smooth; the anterior margin is irregular (or perhaps broken on all\r\nspecimens), and proceeds in an irregular convex curve from the posterior\r\nto the ventral margin.\r\n\r\nThe general shape of the palatoquadrate complex is most nearly like that\r\nof _Rhabdoderma elegans_ (Moy-Thomas, 1937:fig. 5). The orientation of\r\nthe complex in the living fish was probably oblique, with the processus\r\nascendens nearly vertical, the quadrate oblique, and the ventral process\r\nof the endopterygoid extending dorsoanteriorly and articulating with the\r\nparasphenoid.\r\n\r\nOf the hyoid arch only the ceratohyals (see fig. 5A) are preserved in\r\nseveral specimens. These are long, curved bones with a posteroventral\r\nprocess and widened, flaring posterior margin. The medial (?) surface is\r\nconcave in one specimen. The lateral (?) surface displays a distinct\r\nridge on several specimens, arising on the dorsal surface opposite the\r\nposteroventral process and extending diagonally to the anteroventral end\r\nof the anterior limb. The impression of one other specimen appears to\r\nhave a central ridge because of greater dorsal thickness and narrowness.\r\nBoth surfaces are unornamented.\r\n\r\nThe urohyal (see fig. 5B) is an unornamented, Y-shaped bone, with the\r\nstem of the Y pointing anteriorly. Orientation with respect to dorsal\r\nand ventral surfaces is uncertain. In one view a faint ridge, also\r\nY-shaped, occurs on the expanded posterior portion, and the surface is\r\nconvex. The anterior process has a convex surface, sloping evenly off to\r\nthe lateral margin; the opposite side of the process has a concave\r\nsurface. The posterior portion has a slightly depressed area (see fig.\r\n5B) at the junction of the \"arms\" of the Y.\r\n\r\nThe five branchial arches are represented by the ceratobranchials,\r\nseveral of which are preserved on K. U. no. 11431. These are long bones\r\nwith anteriorly curving ventral ends. The medial surfaces are partly\r\ncovered with minute granular teeth; only the dorsal part is without\r\nteeth. The dorsal articular surface is convex dorsally and rounded.\r\n\r\nThe mandible (fig. 3), the best specimens of which are K. U. nos. 788\r\nand 11425, is seen only in lateral and ventral views, with only angular,\r\nsplenial and dentary visible.\r\n\r\nThe angular forms the main body of the mandible, and is similar to that\r\nof _Spermatodus_. The dorsal margin of the angular is expanded in the\r\ncentral region, with some variation. One specimen has an expanded\r\nportion slightly anterior to that of the opposite angular. The articular\r\nsurface near the posterior end has not been observed; the posterior end\r\nof the angular slopes off abruptly. The anterior sutures are seen in\r\nonly two specimens, K. U. nos. 788, 11425. The dentary meets the angular\r\nin a long oblique suture; the dentary gradually tapers posterodorsally\r\nand ends on the dorsal surface of the angular. The splenial fits into a\r\nposteriorly directed, deep V-shaped notch on the ventral surface. The\r\nlateroventral surface of the angular contains sensory pores of the\r\nmandibular line. The ventral surface extends medially into a narrow\r\nshelf, approximately 1.0 mm. wide, which extends the full length of the\r\nbone; the external surface of this shelf is smooth and slightly concave\r\ndorsally. Ornamentation of the angular consists of tubercles and\r\nlongitudinal or oblique striae, occurring mostly on the expanded\r\nportion. The medial surface is not seen. Several broken specimens show\r\na central canal filled with a rod of calcite; in one of these the\r\nsensory pores are also calcite-filled and appear to be connected to the\r\nrod. Thus the pores originally opened into a central canal.\r\n\r\nThe dentary is an unornamented bone with the anterior half curving\r\nmedially; the greatest height is anterior. This bone in specimen K. U.\r\nno. 11425 bears irregularly spaced, simple, recurved, conical teeth;\r\nnine were counted, but there is space for many others. One other\r\nspecimen, no. 11429, seems to have tiny tubercles on the surface. The\r\ndentary meets the splenial dorsally in a straight suture.\r\n\r\nThe splenial also curves medially, and as stated, meets the dentary in a\r\nstraight suture. Ornamentation on this bone was not observed. The\r\nposterior margin is V-shaped and fits the notch in the angular. The\r\nventral surface bears three or more sensory pores of the mandibular\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe gular plates are oval. The medial margin is straight to slightly\r\ncurved, the lateral margin curved crescentically, the posterior end is\r\nblunt, and the anterior end somewhat rounded. Ornamentation varies\r\ngreatly; some bones show only a few tubercles, whereas others exhibit an\r\nalmost concentric pattern of closely spaced striae. Typically there are\r\nsome tubercles in the anterior quarter or third of the total length;\r\nthese pass into longitudinally oriented striae in the posterior section.\r\nA few have only randomly oriented, widely-spaced striae. The internal\r\nsurface is smooth.\r\n\r\nThe coronoid (K. U. no. 11428) is a triangular bone, with the apex\r\npointing dorsally. The lateral surface is smooth; no teeth were\r\nobserved. Moy-Thomas (1937:292, 293) mentions several tooth-bearing\r\ncoronoids in _Rhabdoderma_, but as yet these have not been seen in\r\n_Synaptotylus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Axial skeleton_\r\n\r\nOnly three specimens (K. U. nos. 786F, 787F, 11450) show parts of the\r\nvertebral column, but isolated neural and haemal arches are numerous.\r\nAll are of the coelacanth type, having Y-shaped neural and haemal\r\narches, without centra. A total count of 38 was obtained, but this was\r\nincomplete; the actual number was probably near 50. Counts of 10 and 16\r\nhaemal arches were obtained in two of the specimens. Total height of\r\nneural arches ranges from 7.5 to 12.0 mm., and of haemal arches, from\r\n9.0 to 12.0 mm. The shorter arches are anterior and the height increases\r\ngradually to a maximum in the caudal region. Height of the spines varies\r\nfrom 4.0 to 9.0 mm., or from twice the height of the arch in the\r\nanterior to three times the height in the caudal region. Total width of\r\nthe base, measured in isolated specimens because lateral views in other\r\nspecimens prevented measuring width, ranges from 0.7 to 4.2 mm. The\r\nshort, broad arches having short spines occur at the anterior end of the\r\nspinal column; the narrower arches having tall spines occur toward the\r\ncaudal end. Broken neural and haemal arches show a thin covering of bone\r\nwith a central, calcite-filled cavity, which in life may have been\r\nfilled with cartilage (Stensioe, 1932:58, fig. 20).\r\n\r\nNo ossified ribs have been observed, either isolated or in place.\r\n\r\nFor further description of the axial skeleton, see Hibbard (1933).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). Paired fin\r\ngirdles. A, pectoral girdle, lateral view, based on K. U. no. 11433, x\r\n3.5. B, pelvic girdle basal plate, medial (?) view, based on K. U. no.\r\n788, x 8. Anterior is toward the left.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Girdles and paired fins_\r\n\r\nA nearly complete pectoral girdle on specimen K. U. no. 11433 (see fig.\r\n6A) has only a cleithrum and clavicle. No evidence of an extracleithrum\r\nor supracleithrum has been observed, but the extracleithrum may be fused\r\nto the cleithrum. The two bones form a boot-shaped unit, with the\r\nanteroventral part turned medially to form a horizontal process which\r\nmeets the opposite half of the girdle. In lateral view the surface is\r\nunornamented, and convex in the ventral half. The suture between the\r\ncleithrum and clavicle begins on the expanded posterior portion, the\r\n\"boot-heel,\" at a point immediately below the greatest width on the\r\nposterior margin, passes anteriorly, then turns sharply and parallels\r\nthe anterior margin. The shape of the cleithrum resembles that in\r\n_Rhabdoderma_ and the internal surface is not ridged (see Moy-Thomas,\r\n1937:fig. 9). The exact orientation in the fish is uncertain, but if the\r\nmedian extension is really horizontal, then the posterior expansion is\r\ndirected caudally. The medial surface is concave, steepest near the\r\nanterior margin, and then slopes outward evenly. In medial view one\r\nspecimen (K. U. no. 11426) shows a small, caudally directed projection\r\nof bone, evidently for articulation of the fin-skeleton, at the widest\r\nportion of the cleithrum. Sutures on several specimens were indistinct.\r\nBroken specimens show sutural faces, but many nearly complete specimens\r\nshow little or no indication of sutures, without regard to size of the\r\ngirdles. The internal structure of the fin was not observed.\r\n\r\nNumerous isolated basal plates of the pelvic girdle have revealed\r\ndetails of structure but no information on the orientation. Presumably\r\nthe basal plates of _Synaptotylus_ had essentially the same orientation\r\nas those of other coelacanths (Moy-Thomas, 1937:395). The most complete\r\nbasal plate is K. U. no. 788 (see fig. 6B). The three apophyses diverge\r\nanteriorly; the horizontal one is best developed and the dorsal one is\r\nleast well developed. A median process (Schaeffer, 1952:49), denticulate\r\non several specimens, articulates with the corresponding process of the\r\nopposite plate. The expanded part that articulates with the skeleton of\r\nthe fin extends caudally. The posterior expanded part is nearly square\r\nin outline, resembling the dorsal, rectangular projection. One side\r\nbears ridges leading to the extremities of the apophyses, and faint\r\ncrenulations on the median process. This may be the medial view. The\r\nother view displays a smooth surface, usually without indication of the\r\nridges seen in the reverse view. These specimens differ somewhat from\r\nthe basal plates of _Rhabdoderma_ and appear to be intermediate between\r\n_Rhabdoderma_ and _Coelacanthus_ (Moy-Thomas, 1937:fig. 10A, B). The\r\napophyses are not free as in _Rhabdoderma_ but webbed with bone almost\r\nto their extremities, as in _Coelacanthus_.\r\n\r\nThe pelvic fin is seen in only two specimens (K. U. nos. 786F, 788).\r\nThat on no. 788 is lobate and has 25 lepidotrichia, jointed for\r\napproximately the distal half, and 2.5 to 13.0 mm. in length. Total\r\nlength of the fin is 25.0 mm. There is no trace of the internal skeletal\r\nstructure or of the articulation to the basal plate in either specimen.\r\nFor a description of the fin on no. 786F, see Hibbard (1933:281).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unpaired fins_\r\n\r\nA few isolated bones on K. U. no. 788 (fig. 7) are interpreted as basal\r\nplates of the unpaired fins. For additional description of the unpaired\r\nfins on the type, K. U. no. 786F, see Hibbard (1933).\r\n\r\nTwo of these bones are flat, smooth and oblong, bearing a diagonal ridge\r\nthat extends in the form of a projection. Orientation is completely\r\nunknown. These may be basal plates of the anterior dorsal fin. The fin\r\non no. 786F that Hibbard (1933:281) interpreted as the posterior dorsal\r\nfin is now thought to be the anterior dorsal fin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard). Basal plates of\r\nunpaired fins. A, anterior dorsal fin, based on K. U. no. 788, x 10. B,\r\nposterior dorsal fin, based on K. U. no. 788, x 12. C, anal fin, based\r\non K. U. no. 11450, x 5. Anterior is toward the left.]\r\n\r\nOne distinctive bone may represent the basal plate of the posterior\r\ndorsal fin. This incomplete specimen shows two projecting curved\r\nprocesses, bearing low but distinct ridges, which diverge, probably\r\nanteriorly. The central portion is narrow. The two ridges continue onto\r\nthe posterior portion. This has been broken off, but shows that the\r\nridges diverge again. The surface is smooth, except for the ridges. As\r\nbefore, orientation is uncertain. On no. 786F this fin was interpreted\r\nby Hibbard (1933:281) as the anal fin.\r\n\r\nOnly part of one basal plate of the anal fin was preserved on K. U. no.\r\n11450. That plate is oblong and has an expanded anterior end. The\r\nnarrow, constricted part bears two oblique ridges and a few tubercles.\r\nThe posterior part has nearly straight margins (represented by\r\nimpressions) and the posterior margin is oblique, sloping\r\nanteroventrally. The flared anterior part has a smooth surface. This\r\nbasal plate is more nearly like those of _Coelacanthus_, according to\r\nthe descriptions given by Moy-Thomas (1937:399). The basal plate is\r\nassociated with seven apparently unjointed, incomplete lepidotrichia.\r\nThe anal fin on no. 786F is interpreted as the anterior dorsal fin\r\n(Hibbard, 1933:281).\r\n\r\nThe caudal fins are preserved on K. U. nos. 786F, 787F, and have a total\r\nof 24 lepidotrichia, 12 above and 12 below. These are jointed for the\r\ndistal half or two-thirds, and are up to 16.0 mm. in length. In specimen\r\nno. 787F the supplementary caudal fin has at least seven lepidotrichia,\r\nthe longest of which is 11.0 mm. but incomplete. Anterior lepidotrichia\r\nappear unjointed but the posterior ones are jointed for the distal\r\ntwo-thirds (?) (these are broken off). The supplementary caudal fin is\r\napproximately 1.5 mm. long and 8.0 mm. or more wide. The supplementary\r\ncaudal fin on K. U. no. 786F described by Hibbard (1933:281) could not\r\nbe observed; this part of the caudal fin is missing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Squamation_\r\n\r\nIn the suite of specimens isolated scales are numerous, but patches of\r\nscales are rare. Only two specimens (K. U. nos. 786F, 787F) are complete\r\nenough for scale counts, but preservation permits only partial counts.\r\nIn general the scales resemble those of _Rhabdoderma elegans_\r\n(Newberry).\r\n\r\nThe scales are oval. The exposed posterior part of each bears\r\nposteriorly converging ridges; the anterior part is widest and shows a\r\nfine fibrillar structure. There are at least six scale-rows on either\r\nside of the lateral line. Lateral line scales show no pores, and except\r\nfor slight irregularities in the orientation and length of the posterior\r\nridges, closely resemble the others. Central ridges on the lateral line\r\nscales are shorter and tend to diverge from the center of the impression\r\nof the canal. The lateral line canal shows only as the impression of a\r\ncontinuous canal 0.7 mm. in diameter. Preservation is poorest in scales\r\nalong the line of the neural and haemal arches; therefore lateral line\r\nscales are rarely preserved. Isolated scales are of two types: those on\r\nwhich the posterior ridges converge sharply and form the gothic arch\r\nconfiguration mentioned by Hibbard (1933:282), and those which do not.\r\nBoth types of scales can be present on one fish, as shown by specimen\r\nno. 788. This is not apparent on nos. 786F and 787F; all of the scales\r\non these specimens appear to be much alike. Both Moy-Thomas (1937:385)\r\nand Schaeffer (1952:51, 52) have remarked on the variation of the scales\r\non different parts of the same fish. Because the number of ridges and\r\namount of convergence of the ridges is not related to size of the scale,\r\nit is concluded that these characters are not of taxonomic significance.\r\n\r\nThe strong resemblance of the scales of the Garnett specimens to those\r\nof _Rhabdoderma elegans_ (Newberry) caused Moy-Thomas (1937:399) to add\r\nHibbard's two species to the synonymy of _R. elegans_. But at that time\r\nonly the scales could be adequately described. If the shape of the scale\r\nand the number and pattern of ridges can vary with age, size and shape\r\nof the scale, it follows that assignment of isolated scales to a species\r\nshould not be attempted. Assignment to genus should be made only with\r\ncaution.\r\n\r\n_Discussion._--The relationship of _Synaptotylus_ to other coelacanths\r\nis obscure at present. The knoblike antotic processes on the\r\nbasisphenoid are unlike those of any other known coelacanth. The\r\npalatoquadrate complex is shaped like that of _Rhabdoderma elegans_ but\r\nconsists of fewer bones, probably because of fusion. The scales resemble\r\nthose of _Rhabdoderma_. With regard to general shape of fin girdles, the\r\npectoral girdle resembles that of _Eusthenopteron_ more than that of\r\n_Rhabdoderma_, but the cleithrum is more nearly like the cleithrum of\r\n_Rhabdoderma_. The pelvic girdle appears to be midway between those of\r\n_Rhabdoderma_ and _Coelacanthus_ in general appearance. Regarding the\r\nbasal plates of the remaining fins, those of _Synaptotylus_ appear to\r\nresemble basal plates of both _Rhabdoderma_ and _Coelacanthus_.\r\nConsidering the structure of the sphenethmoid region of the braincase,\r\n_Synaptotylus_ is probably more closely related to _Rhabdoderma_ than\r\nto other known coelacanth genera.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTS ON CLASSIFICATIONS\r\n\r\nClassification of Carboniferous coelacanths has been difficult, partly\r\nbecause the remains are commonly fragmentary, and significant changes in\r\nanatomy did not become apparent in early studies. In general,\r\ncoelacanths have been remarkably stable in most characters, and it has\r\nbeen difficult to divide the group into families. As Schaeffer (1952:56)\r\npointed out, definition of coelacanth genera and species has previously\r\nbeen made on non-meristic characters, and the range of variation within\r\na species has received little attention. For example, Reis (1888:71)\r\nestablished the genus _Rhabdoderma_, using the strong striation of the\r\nscales, gular plates and posterior mandible as the main characters of\r\nthis Carboniferous genus. Moy-Thomas (1937:399-411) referred all\r\nCarboniferous species to _Rhabdoderma_, redescribed the genus and\r\ncompared it to _Coelacanthus_, the Permian genus. He cited as specific\r\ncharacters the ornamentation of the angulars, operculars and gular\r\nplates (Moy-Thomas, 1935:39; 1937:385). Individual variation in some\r\nspecies has rendered ornamentation a poor criterion. This variation is\r\napparent in _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard), some specimens having\r\nlittle or no ornamentation; others having much more. The number of\r\nridges and pattern of ridges on the scales also varies. Schaeffer\r\n(1952:56) has found this to be true of _Diplurus_ also. Moy-Thomas\r\n(1935:40; 1937:385) realized that the type of scale is a poor criterion\r\nfor specific differentiation. In the search for features useful in\r\ndistinguishing genera of coelacanths, Schaeffer and Gregory (1961:3, 7)\r\nfound the structure of the basisphenoid to be distinctive in known\r\ngenera, and thought it had taxonomic significance at this level. Higher\r\ncategories should have as their basis characters that display\r\nevolutionary sequences. A recent classification (Berg, 1940), followed\r\nin this paper, reflects two evolutionary trends in endocranial structure\r\nof coelacanths: reduction of endocranial ossification and loss of the\r\nbasipterygoid processes. Because there has been little change in other\r\nstructures in coelacanths, Berg's classification is the most useful.\r\nBerg (1940:390) includes _Rhabdoderma_ in the suborder Diplocercidoidei\r\nbecause of the presence of the basipterygoid processes, and in the\r\nsingle family, Diplocercidae, but remarks that because of the reduced\r\namount of endocranial ossification the Carboniferous Diplocercidae\r\n\"probably constitute a distinct family.\" In considering this concept of\r\nclassification, the subfamilies Diplocercinae and Rhabdodermatinae of\r\nthe family Diplocercidae are proposed above. The subfamily\r\nRhabdodermatinae includes at present _Rhabdoderma_ and _Synaptotylus_.\r\nThe principal characters of the subfamily Rhabdodermatinae, named for\r\nthe first known genus, are the retention of the basipterygoid processes\r\nand the reduction of endocranial ossification. Application of this\r\nclassification based upon endocranial structure would probably change\r\nexisting groupings of species of Carboniferous coelacanths; the entire\r\ncomplex of Carboniferous genera should be redescribed and redefined. It\r\nwill be necessary to consider endocranial structure in any future\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the evolution previously mentioned appears to have\r\nbeen accomplished during the Carboniferous; thereafter coelacanth\r\nstructure became stabilized. The trend progressed from Devonian\r\ncoelacanths which had two large unpaired bones in the endocranium, and\r\nboth antotic and basipterygoid processes on the basisphenoid, to\r\nCarboniferous fishes in which ossification was reduced to a number of\r\npaired and unpaired bones embedded in cartilage, and retaining both\r\nprocesses, and then post-Carboniferous kinds with reduced ossification\r\nand no basipterygoid processes. The Pennsylvanian was evidently the time\r\nof greatest change for the coelacanths, and they have not changed\r\nsignificantly since, in spite of the fact that since the Jurassic they\r\nhave shifted their environment from shallow, fresh water to moderate\r\ndepth in the sea (Schaeffer, 1953:fig. 1). The changes in endocranial\r\nstructure appear to be significant, and are perhaps related to higher\r\nefficiency of the mouth parts in catching and swallowing prey (see p.\r\n482).\r\n\r\n\r\nENVIRONMENT\r\n\r\nThe coelacanth fishes from the Rock Lake shale are part of the varied\r\nfauna collected from Garnett. Peabody (1952:38) listed many elements of\r\nthe fauna and flora, and concluded that the deposits are of lagoonal\r\norigin. In addition to numerous invertebrates (including microfossils)\r\nand arthropods, a number of vertebrates other than coelacanths have been\r\nfound. These include at least one kind of shark, _Hesperoherpeton\r\ngarnettense_ Peabody, one or more kinds of undescribed labyrinthodonts\r\nand the reptiles _Petrolacosaurus kansensis_ Lane, _Edaphosaurus ecordi_\r\nPeabody, and _Clepsydrops_ (undescribed species). This is indeed a rich\r\nvertebrate fauna, and the earliest known reptilian fauna. Much of the\r\nrock contains plant remains. The flora that has been identified is\r\nadapted to growing in a well-drained soil; although it contains some\r\nelements considered characteristic of the Permian, it is of\r\nPennsylvanian age (Moore _et al._, 1936). Peabody (1952:38-39) discusses\r\nthe features of these lagoonal sediments. Much of the fauna and flora\r\nsuggests continental origin, but the many marine invertebrates at some\r\nhorizons indicate that at least some of the sediments were of marine\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nLittle can be said about the actual environment of the living fishes of\r\nthe genus _Synaptotylus_. Remains of these fishes occur in layers\r\ncontaining marine invertebrates, as well as in those containing plant\r\nremains and vertebrate skeletal parts, and in those nearly completely\r\ncomposed of dark carbonaceous material. Most of the remains are\r\nfragmentary and consist of isolated bones, isolated scales, and\r\ndissociated skulls; only one specimen and half of another are nearly\r\ncomplete. Many published statements on _Rhabdoderma_, a related genus,\r\nindicate both marine and fresh-water environments. Wehrli (1931:115)\r\nregarded _Rhabdoderma elegans_ (Newberry) as a euryhaline species, and\r\ncited its occurrence with both marine and fresh-water fossils. Aldinger\r\n(1931:199) also found this to be the case with other species, and Fiege\r\n(1951:17) quotes others as giving the same information. Keller\r\n(1934:913) thought that few Carboniferous fishes were exclusively\r\nmarine, and stated that the majority of them became adapted to fresh\r\nwater during the late Carboniferous. Later, Schaeffer (1953:175) stated\r\nthat all Carboniferous and Permian coelacanths were fresh-water fishes,\r\nand that many were from swamp deposits. If Keller is correct, then\r\nmembers of the genus _Synaptotylus_ may have inhabited the lagoon, the\r\nadjacent sea, or the streams draining into the lagoon. Perhaps these\r\nfishes swam upstream, as modern salmon and tarpon do, although there is\r\nno direct evidence for this. Possibly they lived in the lagoon at times\r\nof scant rainfall and little runoff, when the salinity of lagoon water\r\napproached normal marine values or the fishes may have lived in the\r\nstreams, and after death were washed into the lagoon. As numerous\r\nremains of land plants and animals were washed in, perhaps this best\r\naccounts for the presence of the fish in nearly all layers of the\r\ndeposits, not only the marine strata.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nA new genus of Pennsylvanian coelacanths, _Synaptotylus_, is described\r\nand a previously named species, _Coelacanthus newelli_ Hibbard, 1933\r\n(_C. arcuatus_ Hibbard, 1933, is a junior synonym), is referred to this\r\ngenus. All specimens of _Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard) were collected\r\nfrom the Rock Lake shale member of the Stanton formation, Lansing group,\r\nMissouri series, six miles northwest of Garnett, Anderson County,\r\nKansas. _Synaptotylus_ is distinguished from all other coelacanths by a\r\nbasisphenoid having large, knoblike antotic processes each connected by\r\na low ridge to a small basipterygoid process. _Synaptotylus_ is most\r\nclosely related to _Rhabdoderma_, but is intermediate between\r\n_Rhabdoderma_ and _Coelacanthus_ in shape of the fin girdles and basal\r\nplates. Two new subfamilies, Diplocercinae and Rhabdodermatinae, of the\r\nfamily Diplocercidae, are proposed. _Synaptotylus_ and _Rhabdoderma_ are\r\nincluded in the subfamily Rhabdodermatinae, because both exhibit reduced\r\nossification in the endocranium and retain basipterygoid processes.\r\n\r\nLoss of the basipterygoid processes in post-Carboniferous coelacanths\r\nmay reflect the development of a more efficient feeding mechanism, by\r\nallowing the palatoquadrate complex and mandible to swing farther\r\nlaterally and expand the oral cavity.\r\n\r\n_Synaptotylus newelli_ (Hibbard) may have occupied either the sea or\r\nfresh water; these fishes occur in lagoonal deposits with reptiles and\r\namphibians, arthropods, marine invertebrates and remains of land plants.\r\n\r\nBecause scale patterns on _Synaptotylus_ and _Rhabdoderma_ are so nearly\r\nsimilar and vary with size of the scale and its location on the fish, it\r\nis recommended that isolated scales not be assigned to a species, and to\r\na genus only with great caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nALDINGER, H.\r\n\r\n1931.
